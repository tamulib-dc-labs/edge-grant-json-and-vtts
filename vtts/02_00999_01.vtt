WEBVTT

00:01.263 --> 00:06.189
1989 at Portland, Texas in the home of Jack Kumkel 
concerning the Vietnam War. In the interest of

00:06.670 --> 00:13.358
accumulating knowledge about the war, I'm going 
to donate this tape to the Texas A&M Oral History

00:06.670 --> 00:13.358
Collection in the University Archives. Is that 
all right with you? Yes.

00:21.588 --> 00:28.637
I'm going to ask you first about the biological 
data, your date and place of birth. September 2nd,

00:29.157 --> 00:32.742
1933 in Indiana, Pennsylvania. Okay. Education? 
I have a bachelor's degree from the University of

00:35.006 --> 00:41.676
Pittsburgh and a MBA from George Washington 
University. Okay. Brief sketch of your military

00:44.020 --> 00:48.286
career before Vietnam? Being a supply corps 
officer, I was supply officer of the destroyer.

00:56.512 --> 00:59.056
right out of college. And from there I ran a 
commissary store in Greencoe Springs, Florida.

01:05.284 --> 01:10.672
From there I was supply officer in a facility in 
Antigua in the West Indies. From there I was Navy

01:11.834 --> 01:23.530
exchange officer in Washington, D.C. And from 
there I went to Vietnam. Your date and place of tour

01:24.912 --> 01:28.519
in Vietnam? I got there right during the Tet 
Offensive, which was in 1969,

01:28.679 --> 01:44.908
and that was in February of 69, and I left in 
February of 70. And where was that? I went into

01:46.512 --> 01:59.489
consulate air base when I first went into Vietnam 
and I was the supply officer of the Navy facility at

01:46.512 --> 01:59.489
Cam Nong Bay. Your rank? I was lieutenant 
commander. The type of service or job

02:04.175 --> 02:06.478
description? I was the senior supply corps 
officer for the Navy in 3 Corps. Vietnam was

02:12.925 --> 02:24.957
divided into three areas, and I was the senior 
supply corps

02:12.925 --> 02:24.957
officer in 3 Corps during the time that I was there. 
How you felt when you found out you were going to

02:24.977 --> 02:26.138
Vietnam? I volunteered for Vietnam. Description 
of the place you were first assigned to?

02:31.644 --> 02:35.908
Initially, I went into Saigon, and this was during 
the Tet Offensive. And I spent my first two weeks

02:36.175 --> 02:41.629
there in indoctrination because the funding for 
Cam Ranh Bay from out of Saigon. And prior to going

02:46.532 --> 02:52.279
up there, I spent two weeks with a Captain Hine 
there when he picked me up at the airport from Tan

02:46.532 --> 02:52.279
Samu. And I remember going in to Saigon from Tan 
Samu to the air base where he even, he broke out his

02:53.100 --> 03:11.785
.45 and laid it on the window as we were going 
through some areas of South Vietnam. And the whole

03:12.119 --> 03:27.683
two weeks that I was in Saigon, every night the sky 
was lit up, the bed shook all day and all night from

03:12.119 --> 03:27.683
the bombing around Saigon. So it was a rather 
interesting period and one of a lot of activities

03:27.703 --> 03:35.275
at the time. And how much contact did you have with 
the Vietnamese people, and how did they react to

03:35.575 --> 03:40.664
you? Oh, I loved the Vietnamese people. They were 
real kind. They didn't have a formal education,

03:43.248 --> 03:47.195
but they had good common sense. And I think the more 
education you get, the more you appreciate people

03:47.215 --> 03:53.145
with common sense. They were extremely good this 
way. I was able to get my own interpreter, and it was

03:56.896 --> 04:01.303
rather unique. I don't drink at all. And when I went 
into the officer's club, I always had Cokes. And a

04:07.251 --> 04:13.881
sister of the bartender in there, her name was 
Soon, and she was a 16-year-old girl. And she

04:13.901 --> 04:19.048
learned to speak English from being in the 
officer's club there. And a little later, I picked

04:19.349 --> 04:25.613
her up at 25 cents an hour to work in the supply 
department. And since she was able to speak

04:26.099 --> 04:37.275
Vietnamese and English, I soon started taking her 
on my trips around Vietnam because she was my

04:26.099 --> 04:37.275
interpreter there. And I had my own jeep, and being 
a senior supply corps officer, I was responsible

04:37.295 --> 04:48.070
for paying all the people in the three-quarter 
area of Vietnam. So I did get out into the

04:48.090 --> 04:49.913
communities. And I particularly noticed in each 
one of the communities that the new areas were all

04:49.893 --> 04:58.842
schools. And the new buildings were schools. The 
Vietnamese were finally educating the

05:01.645 --> 05:07.452
Buddhists. When the French was there, the French 
only educated the Catholics. And the Catholics

05:11.496 --> 05:15.360
make up about 10% of Vietnam, the Buddhists about 
90%. So as a result, with these new schools and with

05:16.015 --> 05:25.068
Vietnamese teachers, the people finally felt 
they were now getting something from the

05:16.015 --> 05:25.068
government. And they were supporting the 
government in Saigon because now their children

05:25.088 --> 05:33.220
were getting an education where they didn't have 
that opportunity. Before you came to Vietnam, how

05:33.260 --> 05:37.045
much did you know about their educational 
origins? Were you trained or did you have any

05:37.514 --> 05:40.317
education? No, I was supposed to go to a SEER 
school, a survival school, prior to that, prior to

05:40.337 --> 05:47.944
going over there. But they cut that short because 
of Lieutenant Prince and some of the other people.

05:55.571 --> 06:03.338
But as far as knowledge of Vietnam, prior to that, I 
had very

05:55.571 --> 06:03.338
little knowledge. Do you have your opinion on the 
U.S. strategy? Well, I think it was strictly

06:06.455 --> 06:13.763
political. Had we wanted to win it, we could have 
very easily won it. Politics was such a heavy

06:19.208 --> 06:29.840
factor in it that we weren't allowed to do what we 
wanted, and the Vietnamese weren't allowed to do

06:19.208 --> 06:29.840
what they wanted. Now, to give you an example, I was 
very close with one of the Vietnamese colonels

06:29.860 --> 06:34.825
there. And he said that he would like to see the 
Americans go primarily so that they could walk

06:35.108 --> 06:50.431
above the 17th parallel, give the North 
Vietnamese a dose of their own medicine. Because

06:50.451 --> 07:04.272
the North Vietnamese were allowed to come down and 
sabotage and snipe in South Vietnam, but the

06:50.451 --> 07:04.272
Americans didn't allow the South Vietnamese to go 
up north and do the same thing. The Vietnamese

07:04.606 --> 07:15.659
would have preferred that the Americans leave 
because all the Vietnamese girls were changing

07:04.606 --> 07:15.659
their habits. They were becoming Americanized. 
And they were running around with American men.

07:20.905 --> 07:24.049
And they wanted their girls back to the Vietnamese 
men. And the reason they were with American men is

07:24.069 --> 07:27.773
because the American men had the money. And 
actually, the girls wanted the entertainment

07:28.334 --> 07:34.461
that was associated with the money that the 
Americans could provide them with. How did you

07:34.627 --> 07:39.974
feel about the conventional war method versus the 
guerrilla war method? Did you feel that we had, we

07:39.994 --> 07:48.686
were conventional, had conventional lines and 
went into a guerrilla warfare type of situation?

07:49.026 --> 07:52.230
Well, we weren't really in a guerrilla warfare 
there. They were. Now, we could have been very

07:53.052 --> 08:01.663
successful in the guerrilla war against the North 
Vietnamese had we allowed the Vietnamese to go

07:53.052 --> 08:01.663
north. And I might add, even when we bombed in North 
Vietnam, we could only hit certain targets. I was

08:11.079 --> 08:21.855
with a Navy pilot that turned in his wings after 92 
missions, and he says, I refuse to go anymore

08:11.079 --> 08:21.855
because we're not allowed to hit the targets we see 
down there. He says, we can only hit the bridges.

08:24.939 --> 08:30.047
And what happens is that... They know exactly 
where we're coming. They know exactly what our

08:33.209 --> 08:40.238
targets are, and they just lay up all kind of flak to 
the planes coming in. Also, the Vietnamese would

08:40.438 --> 08:48.148
put all of their convoys in residential areas. 
They stored all of their oil around the schools or

08:48.208 --> 08:53.014
in the churches. I oil around the schools. They put 
their anti-aircraft guns around the churches so

08:55.666 --> 09:08.611
that if we did knock them out, we'd either be 
hitting their schools or we'd be hitting their

08:55.666 --> 09:08.611
churches, which is the propaganda-type war that 
they're using against us. Did you have any actual

09:08.631 --> 09:11.256
training or experiences in combat? Oh, not 
really. The first evening that I got into Cam Ranh

09:14.727 --> 09:24.621
Bay, they shot a few mortars over at us. What

09:24.961 --> 09:31.871
time of the day was most active for you? Well, being 
a Supply Corps officer, we had normal hours

09:31.891 --> 09:40.382
primarily. We, of course, had our perimeter 
watches, and we had to do these entries and so on,

09:41.729 --> 09:53.065
and watched our perimeter. But at Cameron Bay, we 
were particularly fortunate in that the mainland

10:00.848 --> 10:06.494
between our base and Vietnam itself was patrolled 
by the South Koreans. And the South Koreans were

10:06.514 --> 10:18.967
very dedicated to the task they were doing, and the 
Vietnamese didn't want to tangle with them. They

10:19.187 --> 10:28.577
would rather come up against the Americans 
because the Americans would ask questions and

10:19.187 --> 10:28.577
usually not shoot, or the Koreans would usually 
shoot first if someone got into their area.

10:29.249 --> 10:36.381
Comment on the quality of Arvin, South 
Vietnamese, and the enemy as fighters? Yes, I

10:36.401 --> 10:40.869
think they were decent fighters. This is contrary 
to the news media that we constantly heard. I was

10:46.258 --> 10:53.991
with a Navy captain that was on the base where I was. 
He was also in the Korean War. And at the time I was

10:57.155 --> 11:09.611
there, which was 1970, 69 and 70, he said that the 
Vietnamese were far ahead of where the Koreans

10:57.155 --> 11:09.611
were at the same time. So that he felt, as far as 
pacification was concerned, that the Vietnamese

11:10.112 --> 11:22.408
were far ahead of the Koreans and were making more 
progress, and had made progress quicker in 1970.

11:22.608 --> 11:26.513
Do you have your views on Selective Service? I 
would be in favor of Selective Service. Mainly

11:31.198 --> 11:39.548
because I think our young people need to know what 
goes on in other countries. I think that even if

11:39.568 --> 11:47.817
it's a six month tour, I think it would be wise to do 
this. I think the conception of the military is far

11:49.979 --> 12:07.145
different than what it actually

11:49.979 --> 12:07.145
is.

12:10.851 --> 12:13.715
Prior to going into the military, I always thought 
someone who made a career out of the military was a

12:10.851 --> 12:13.715
person who couldn't get a job elsewhere. That was 
the way I felt about it. And, of course, once I got

12:14.416 --> 12:17.481
in, I liked the challenges and learned about the 
travel and the competition with my peer groups as

12:14.416 --> 12:17.481
being the same age as I am. Okay, your views on the 
National Guard? I don't have contact with the

12:18.886 --> 12:22.591
National Guard. I don't think I'm given any 
intelligence. Am I correct in saying that the

12:26.956 --> 12:32.664
National Guard did not play any part in Vietnam? I 
didn't have any contact with them. Who did you

12:36.028 --> 12:39.072
receive your orders from, or where did they 
originate? My boss was in Saigon, Captain Hine,

12:39.406 --> 12:49.137
and he handled the funding for the base. So that was 
about my immediate superior. Now, he was a

12:54.603 --> 13:06.536
commanding officer of the base, also in the 
workforce, but as

12:54.603 --> 13:06.536
far as funding and so forth, he was not in Saigon. 
What was your opinion about careerism? in the

13:09.308 --> 13:13.775
military during Vietnam and did it since? I was a 
career Navy man. And like I said, I volunteered. I

13:18.142 --> 13:26.676
was a lieutenant commander when I went over and 
made commander shortly after I went back. I was

13:27.415 --> 13:29.379
already career. I believed in what we were doing. I 
still believe in what we were doing over there. I

13:35.731 --> 13:40.561
think the U.S. Congress did the Vietnamese people 
a terrible injustice. I think our news media was

13:40.581 --> 13:48.917
terribly slanted that portrayed a situation that 
was totally out of context. When I first come back

13:49.252 --> 13:57.064
and I would hear the newscasters talking about 
areas that I've been in, I'd just jump out of my

13:49.252 --> 13:57.064
chair. They were lying. And then how our news media 
got this information or how it was posted, I really

13:58.387 --> 14:04.797
don't know. But it was a terrible injustice to me 
and these people and the contacts that I had with

14:04.817 --> 14:11.247
them. What about the, like, when they switched... 
people in command so often. In Vietnam? Yeah, they

14:19.610 --> 14:24.456
rotated them every year.

14:26.219 --> 14:29.623
Well, you could go back the second time. You could 
go back again. When you're away from your family a

14:31.165 --> 14:39.576
year, this can be detrimental to home life. I don't 
know that I would want to send our men over there

14:40.028 --> 15:05.294
longer than a year at a time and still be married 
because that's a terribly long time for children

14:40.028 --> 15:05.294
to

14:40.028 --> 15:05.294
be without a father and so on. Okay. Could you 
comment on problems in Vietnam such as drugs? The

15:10.522 --> 15:12.710
drugs were there. I never had any problem in my 
department. I handled quarters myself, and I was

15:17.660 --> 15:35.388
very emphatic that anyone in my department that 
was involved in drugs, that I wanted other members

15:17.660 --> 15:35.388
of my department to straighten them out. And I told 
them I didn't want them to come to me with it, I

15:35.408 --> 15:44.562
wanted them to get it corrected because they were 
out in the perimeters protecting us when we were

15:35.408 --> 15:44.562
sleeping, And many of them had been involved in 
drugs, and we couldn't sleep at night. And I

15:52.999 --> 16:02.274
expected each of my people to straighten out 
anyone that would get involved in drugs. And as a

16:02.454 --> 16:09.125
result, and the whole time I was there, I didn't 
have one single drug problem in my life. OK. How

16:09.145 --> 16:10.768
about you? No, we all took our pills while we were 
over there, took the malaria. I remember

16:19.401 --> 16:30.006
one time the medical doctor came by my room and he 
says, why don't you take your salt tablets? And I

16:30.290 --> 16:37.218
said, well, how do you

16:30.290 --> 16:37.218
know, doc? And he said, well,

16:38.840 --> 16:48.632
look at your mouth. And I had cold blisters on my 
mouth. It was hot over there, very humid, and we

16:49.393 --> 16:51.456
perspired a lot. So as a result, we had to take salt 
taverns and lack of salt when I would get cold

16:51.476 --> 16:54.199
sores. That was the only effect that I ever had. We 
took our malaria pills off. We never had any

16:55.681 --> 16:56.622
trouble on our base with that. Did you respect your 
leaders? Oh, absolutely. We had good people. Not

17:00.761 --> 17:09.796
only this, I had the best men in Vietnam that I've 
had in the areas that I've worked in, the

17:00.761 --> 17:09.796
department I've run. Mainly because they would 
send me a lot of college graduates in enlisted

17:09.816 --> 17:16.968
ranks. And

17:17.889 --> 17:22.657
I just got excellent people. Plus, In the supply 
department, there's a lot of Filipinos that work

17:23.733 --> 17:36.410
in that area, and they were close to home, and they 
would have a chance about every two months to get a

17:23.733 --> 17:36.410
flight to the Philippines for a week. So as a 
result, I had top notch Philippine enlisted men

17:36.430 --> 17:52.592
that ran the messes for me, that is the officer's 
clubs, the enlisted messes, the barber shop, also

17:36.430 --> 17:52.592
the retail store. And I even had some in my regular 
supply department operations so that I just had

17:53.315 --> 18:02.235
top-notch people. So I didn't find, I found that I 
had the best people over there. And my department

18:08.300 --> 18:16.979
was run the best that I had run at any time in my 
career. My Kardex system, which is what we use over

18:17.160 --> 18:23.233
there, said in my warehouse there was going to be 
three in a certain location. I had three in a

18:23.393 --> 18:25.077
certain location. I also had Vietnamese 
employees that worked with us, but they were real

18:25.327 --> 18:34.221
fine people and did an excellent job. And the 
Russians are running over there now. They got that

18:38.648 --> 18:47.081
base, and they got a fine running operation. Do you 
feel you were justified in going over there in the

18:47.101 --> 18:49.765
first place, and why? Well, I think that will 
probably be debated over the years. I supported my

18:54.391 --> 18:58.297
government in doing this. I felt they had a bigger 
picture than what I had of it. And

19:03.304 --> 19:12.556
the communists were trying to take over that 
country by force. And the Vietnamese people did

19:14.078 --> 19:21.068
not want the communists there. We had set up the 
road system so that each of the handlers, they had

19:22.060 --> 19:32.535
reasonably good roads built by the U.S. military. 
We set up the communication system from

19:32.555 --> 19:45.172
telephones to television where they were getting 
word out of Saigon as to what was happening from

19:32.555 --> 19:45.172
time to time. Everything was set up in a 
communication manner Initially, there was a big

19:50.680 --> 20:05.500
language barrier, but there were enough Lebanese 
that also spoke English by the time I was there that

19:50.680 --> 20:05.500
communications even verbally were excellent. 
No, I

20:05.648 --> 20:14.926
thought they cooperated real well. I didn't see a 
problem with this. The Koreans were probably the

20:18.532 --> 20:24.243
best fighters over there, though. Do you feel that 
the South Vietnamese had a real desire to fight.

20:28.840 --> 20:29.501
Yes, they did. And they did because they wanted 
self-determination. They wanted to be, they saw

20:35.570 --> 20:39.957
their government getting their kids an 
education. And then Even in the Delta, in the

20:45.389 --> 21:02.445
Mekong Delta, by the time I was there, it was in that 
period, 69 to 70, they were producing enough rice

20:45.389 --> 21:02.445
in the Delta, it was pacified enough that they 
could even export rice. So they were getting their

21:02.505 --> 21:06.589
system back in order. And I still am angry at the 
U.S. Congress and what they did to these people. Do

21:16.793 --> 21:18.856
you think we could have won the war? Absolutely. By 
continuing to, when we pulled our troops out, just

21:21.439 --> 21:32.375
providing them with military supplies, there's 
no question in my mind that we would have won. The

21:32.395 --> 21:38.463
stampede came out of the central part up in the 
last, which is a college area.

21:41.407 --> 21:43.510
The stampede started up in that area. as a result of 
the U.S. Congress cutting off aid, total aid to

21:44.080 --> 21:51.067
Vietnam. Not only had the U.S. Congress and the 
President, President Nixon at the time, they said

21:51.268 --> 22:05.162
he'd take all the people out, but he promised them 
to give them military aid so that they could

21:51.268 --> 22:05.162
continue to fight for their own 
self-determination. But then, after the bulk of

22:05.182 --> 22:10.628
our people were taken out, the U.S. Congress cut 
off the money. As far as aid or supplies, when they

22:11.215 --> 22:20.809
did this, this caused the panic, and that panic 
just overran. It was taken over by panic more than

22:20.989 --> 22:24.454
anything else. And it was totally unnecessary, 
unjustified, and a black date, as far as I'm

22:24.474 --> 22:33.627
concerned, in American history. So if you could 
put the blank on something. It was Congress. No

22:36.291 --> 22:37.453
doubt about it. U.S. Congress and the liberal news 
media. What was it like when you came home? How did

22:45.162 --> 22:48.305
people react to you when you told them you wanted to 
come home? Well, I never had a problem. I read about

22:49.767 --> 22:54.732
people looking down on you in Vietnam. I had a 
sister-in-law that my mother threw out of her

22:54.752 --> 23:01.379
house because she was having a fit that I was going 
to Vietnam.

23:05.443 --> 23:10.888
And that's probably as close as anyone would be 
making any comments. My feeling coming back, I

23:11.375 --> 23:17.664
didn't see anything adverse. I wasn't looking for 
anything, any hero's welcome or anything like

23:18.585 --> 23:24.233
that. I was doing my job as far as I was concerned. I 
was doing what I felt was right for my country, and I

23:28.880 --> 23:32.505
still feel that. So your views haven't changed 
since the war? No, I'm not. In fact, it angers me

23:36.333 --> 24:01.409
more that I see the way the U.S. Congress got away 
with doing that, and the news media support him,

23:36.333 --> 24:01.409
and even Walter Cronkite is coming out with his CBS 
capsule reports on Vietnam still supporting the

23:36.333 --> 24:01.409
lies that were perpetrated on American people at 
that time. And it's wrong. Did you have a question

24:04.244 --> 24:08.071
while you were in Portland? No. I volunteered and 
they're fine people. I wish I could have helped

24:13.321 --> 24:15.345
them more. To give you an example,

24:15.405 --> 24:27.248
one time I was downtown in my Jeep and since I was a 
lieutenant commander at the time, that's

24:15.405 --> 24:27.248
equivalent to a major. And some young fellow was 
yelling at me. He says, Major, Major. He says, come

24:32.827 --> 24:33.628
here. He says, my parents work for you. See, I 
didn't know that. And he says, come. He says, I want

24:40.676 --> 24:43.759
you to see my home. So I got out of my Jeep and I went 
over to his home. And it was an area, oh, I would say

24:48.544 --> 24:55.452
maybe 12 feet square. This is where the home where 
There were the mother and three children. And

25:01.153 --> 25:21.417
there was bare walls and

25:01.153 --> 25:21.417
the walls were about 12 inches off from the ground 
so that they had ventilation into the house. And

25:22.325 --> 25:30.035
they had sheets of plywood leaning up against the 
wall that they laid on the floor with what they

25:22.325 --> 25:30.035
slept on at night. And on the one wall was a 
crucifix. They were a Catholic family. But they

25:39.889 --> 25:44.535
had a black lacquer painting that they had brought 
from North Vietnam. They had been Catholic

25:48.850 --> 25:54.297
refugees from North Vietnam. And he told me that 
the reason he could speak English, he was going to

25:54.538 --> 26:08.717
the University of the Latin, and he was studying to 
be a priest.

26:09.541 --> 26:20.767
When I got back to my quarters, I went over to the 
Catholic chaplain and I told him about this boy and

26:09.541 --> 26:20.767
I said, surely there ought to be some Catholic 
charities. And because his dad was making 50 cents

26:21.168 --> 26:27.904
an hour working for me as a carpenter. I said, 
surely there ought to be a Catholic charity that

26:28.508 --> 26:43.329
could pick up this boy's education so

26:28.508 --> 26:43.329
that the family making such a meager wage wouldn't 
have to be going through all these costs. So I took

26:43.349 --> 26:58.431
the Catholic chaplain over to the family, and sure 
enough, the Catholic charity did pick up his costs

26:43.349 --> 26:58.431
up until the time that I left the economy. Whenever 
I left Vietnam, on my desk, the day I left, was this

26:59.170 --> 27:10.622
particular picture. And this, it was the only 
thing they had. And on it was a note. It says that

27:20.273 --> 27:27.000
Commander, no, Major, it says, Major, no matter 
where you are, there will always be someone in

27:20.273 --> 27:27.000
Vietnam to watch you.

27:33.359 --> 27:53.578
In

27:33.359 --> 27:53.578
general, tell me how the American soldiers felt 
about Vietnam all through the war up until the

27:33.359 --> 27:53.578
fallout. Well, one of the difficulties were that a 
lot of them were draftees that went over there. So,

28:01.876 --> 28:10.234
being draftees and maybe not being career type 
persons Their attitudes were a lot different for

28:11.125 --> 28:27.944
serving in the military, let alone going to 
Vietnam where the press was certainly not based in

28:11.125 --> 28:27.944
the government continuum. So there were a lot of 
boys that were over there that didn't want to be

28:28.144 --> 28:40.778
there, and fighting an unpopular war at home. 
There was a lot of resentment. We lost,

28:45.307 --> 28:53.280
particularly in the Navy and Marines, we lost a lot 
of young officers who were being dragged. By that I

28:53.821 --> 29:00.651
mean that they were shot in the back by their own men 
or they were injured. So we lost some good officers

29:01.192 --> 29:04.217
this way. because of the caliber of people that 
particularly Marines and the Army say over there.

29:13.816 --> 29:17.761
For one, the Marines should have never been 
involved. That's the Army's job, not the Marines.

29:23.648 --> 29:24.890
And they pulled the Marines in there. And this hurt 
the Marine Corps for many years because of these

29:24.910 --> 29:37.064
draftees that got in there at this one o'clock in 
the morning or where they really wanted to be. So

29:38.426 --> 29:43.232
the attitude of the Navy was entirely

29:43.550 --> 29:48.675
different.

29:51.578 --> 29:56.843
We didn't

29:51.578 --> 29:56.843
draft people to put them in Vietnam. I had good men. 
My men were solid. They were good citizens. They

30:00.606 --> 30:00.886
re-upped. What I mean is they decided they wanted 
to stay there and continue their two-year tour or

30:00.906 --> 30:11.076
stay there longer. Because every six months over 
there, if they would stay or request staying, they

30:11.275 --> 30:30.942
would get a 30-day rotation

30:11.275 --> 30:30.942
period where they would go to Hong Kong or to 
Singapore or the Philippines or Tokyo and so on for

30:11.275 --> 30:30.942
30 days. Is that for everyone? Yes, for the 
enlisted personnel. So every six months they

30:34.816 --> 30:38.680
would be given this. So this was pretty nice, plus 
they were able to save everything that was made.

30:46.369 --> 30:46.990
They were making all the money. And they were 
making extra money because

30:47.010 --> 30:57.681
they

30:47.010 --> 30:57.681
were using it for something. Why did we pull out ? Of 
course, because of the politics at home,

31:01.968 --> 31:08.518
President Nixon said that he or phase

31:08.752 --> 31:20.745
the people out, which he did. And I think it was 
proper. I think it was done. I think the

31:23.227 --> 31:25.890
pacification had been completed. I think it was 
time for the Vietnamese to go ahead and start

31:25.910 --> 31:31.436
making their own decisions and get the Americans 
out of that because I think they were trained well

31:25.910 --> 31:31.436
enough and they can handle it. I think it was 
proper. What was wrong was when Congress

31:32.157 --> 31:44.651
cut

31:32.157 --> 31:44.651
off the money. The Vietnamese could have handled 
it. They would have handled it. And I think it's

31:45.993 --> 31:47.314
unforgivable if the U.S. Congress didn't do that. 
What was your view

31:47.334 --> 31:51.379
on Antifa? Do they have every right to do it? I feel I 
was over there for the right for those people to do

31:57.233 --> 31:59.636
that. I did not agree with them as far as their 
protest is concerned, but I will continue to fight

31:59.896 --> 32:10.630
for their right to protest. I think that this is 
important. Any time I'm ever angry at my

32:13.814 --> 32:23.847
government and want to protest, I want to be able to 
do it. Well, you see, What was happening, when I

32:26.427 --> 32:30.993
come back, I wanted to get out and speak. I wanted to 
do it. And I was told very emphatically my job was to

32:34.016 --> 32:41.806
carry out foreign policy, not to make it. When 
you're in the military, you carry out what the

32:42.607 --> 32:50.396
politicians, the mistakes the politicians make. 
You go over there and leave for their mistakes.

32:55.267 --> 33:02.035
Yeah, you might guess that I vote politicians in 
pretty low speed. Because whenever they, when

33:02.055 --> 33:12.168
they're not successful, then they'll use the 
military to do their dirty work. But,

33:12.188 --> 33:19.938
yeah, I will die for my country. I've always said 
that. I believe in the United States. I love my

33:23.142 --> 33:23.502
country. But I'll also fight for the right for 
those people to demonstrate against me when I'm

33:24.342 --> 33:36.916
wrong, or whenever they think that I'm wrong. I 
think this is the great thing about a democracy,

33:37.097 --> 33:53.235
and I think everyone should have the right to 
demonstrate, and if the government makes a

33:37.097 --> 33:53.235
mistake, then they should have to face the gravity 
of it. Oh

33:55.257 --> 34:10.339
yeah, I don't, I won't think about it. It makes me 
very angry. What you do is that you have to think

34:16.891 --> 34:23.541
positive thoughts. And that's what I do. So, no, I 
don't think positive thoughts. I refuse to think

34:32.134 --> 34:34.798
positive thoughts. Okay. And this

34:35.118 --> 34:39.585
last question. If you had a message to the college 
students today, try and clear up some

34:39.605 --> 34:42.309
misconceptions about Vietnam, what would it be? 
Hmm.

34:46.355 --> 35:02.836
I would suppose that I realize that the news media 
is involved in headlines, sensationalism,

34:46.355 --> 35:02.836
trying to get people to buy their publication. And 
not necessarily are they always interesting to

35:02.856 --> 35:07.502
me. And you're going to have to go beyond. You 
really need to talk to the people to find out if the

35:13.211 --> 35:18.437
truth really is there. Many times, the truth is 
bland, and it doesn't get published. Or if it is, it

35:23.203 --> 35:33.075
gets on the fifth or

35:23.203 --> 35:33.075
sixth page after the sensationalists and the 
Republicans. So I would think for young people

35:33.095 --> 35:35.498
today is that, be very cautious with the freedom of 
the press. It's something we have to fight to

35:41.080 --> 35:43.604
protect. But also, with that freedom, they can do a 
lot of things that just

35:44.165 --> 35:52.958
aren't natural. I appreciate that.
