Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of 
their country. Now is the time for all good men to

00:04.464 --> 00:08.669
come to the aid of their country. Now is the time.

00:13.516 --> 00:17.000
Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of 
their country.

00:20.184 --> 00:22.948
Dr. Mobley, it's nice to be here with you this 
morning. You would tell us, please, sir, who you

00:23.088 --> 00:26.974
are and where you came from originally. Well, 
indeed, William Hodges Mobley, and I was Born in

00:30.794 --> 00:35.380
Akron, Ohio in November the 15th, 1941. And I

00:35.420 --> 00:42.409
grew up in the Akron area. Went to public schools 
there.

00:50.360 --> 00:55.526
Went off to a small liberal arts school in Ohio 
called Denison University. And I graduated there

00:56.888 --> 00:59.772
in 1963. degree in psychology and a minor in 
economics. Thoroughly enjoyed that small

01:04.033 --> 01:07.438
liberal arts school experience. And as with many 
of those small schools, one of their objectives is

01:07.639 --> 01:17.333
to encourage as many as possible to go on to 
graduate school or professional school. And so I

01:17.473 --> 01:21.439
had that instilled early on. But I took a 
circuitous route. I went to work first. And with a

01:25.044 --> 01:30.332
psychology major, they're limited. entry-level 
opportunities for back in those times. I went to

01:37.034 --> 01:40.697
work in human resources. I really was lucky. A 
company called PPG Industries used to be called

01:42.238 --> 01:46.702
Pittsburgh Plate Glass. They got hired there in 
their personnel employee relations department.

01:53.168 --> 01:59.053
My first major job after a six-month or so 
orientation was to go on the college recruiting

01:59.641 --> 02:01.844
circuits. So I spent two years out visiting 
universities all over this country doing

02:02.505 --> 02:08.813
recruiting and thoroughly enjoyed that. The 
travel were out in a hurry, but the ability to see a

02:08.893 --> 02:16.183
lot of universities... Did you get down to this 
part of the world? I did, indeed, in several ways.

02:19.047 --> 02:27.618
We did college recruiting during the year, but 
during that time, PPG was in an expansion mode and

02:19.047 --> 02:27.618
building plants all over the country, including 
here in Texas. The... A plant was built in Wichita

02:30.202 --> 02:33.947
Falls at the time. It was one of the largest glass 
plants in the world. It was a new location. We had

02:39.394 --> 02:45.622
Houston Chemical here outside of Beaumont. We had 
a plant in Corpus Christi, one across the border in

02:45.642 --> 02:51.290
Lake Charles, Louisiana. A lot of distribution 
centers. So there was a lot of activity here in

02:53.607 --> 02:56.893
Texas. What years were those? This would have been 
64 through 67. I worked

03:02.643 --> 03:08.915
PPG. I had some other assignments. I was in 
Pittsburgh in employee relations and labor

03:12.421 --> 03:17.370
relations and others. And then they sent me down to 
their largest GLAST operation, which was in

03:17.890 --> 03:28.724
Cumberland, Maryland, to be director of training 
and development.

03:30.366 --> 03:32.228
And I enjoyed that assignment. And by that time, we 
had a daughter, and we're thinking, well, about

03:33.670 --> 03:42.321
the next year, we'll go back to graduate school. 
And that had been my plan all along, and then to do it

03:42.341 --> 03:47.408
in organizational psychology. Well, during 
early in my assignment in Cumberland, Maryland, I

03:48.080 --> 03:57.109
had an opportunity to meet the people at the 
University of Maryland on a project we were doing

03:48.080 --> 03:57.109
with them. So I got to know them. But I was still 
thinking in my field, some of the stronger

03:58.210 --> 04:08.000
organizational psychology programs are really 
in the Big Ten, Illinois and Ohio State and

03:58.210 --> 04:08.000
Minnesota. So I'd been thinking there long. But 
I'd gotten to know the people at Maryland. And they

04:13.305 --> 04:15.207
called me. It was around Easter. Because when we 
went over, the cherry blossoms were already

04:17.695 --> 04:22.041
blooming. I remember that. And I took our little 
youngster. And they called. And one of the faculty

04:24.785 --> 04:29.131
members I'd gotten to know had just gotten a new NIH 
grant. And he said, I've got a fellowship. You'll

04:31.894 --> 04:32.495
come over. So we chucked over there for a weekend 
and took a look at it and decided, let's do it. Which

04:39.925 --> 04:40.666
we did. And I wouldn't look back for a minute. I got 
it. It was a great experience, superb education at

04:43.750 --> 04:47.836
the University of Maryland. For four years we 
lived in graduate student housing at the

04:48.477 --> 04:56.469
University of Maryland. I took a leave from PPG and 
they continued to treat me very well. They gave me

05:02.178 --> 05:08.307
consulting assignments and they had a stock plan 
vested. That kept vesting each year we were in

05:08.658 --> 05:16.627
school, and that helped us live with some creature 
comfort while in graduate school. So we had a good

05:16.647 --> 05:22.753
experience there and had our second daughter in 
Washington while we lived there. So it was a good

05:22.814 --> 05:25.096
experience. Then I went back to PPG for two years, 
started their human resource and employee

05:25.116 --> 05:32.184
relations research function. They never had 
that. So you're talking about roughly 1971?

05:36.425 --> 05:37.866
That's right, 1971 to 1973. I went back to PPG. And 
you have a Ph.D. now in industrial organization

05:43.151 --> 05:49.097
psychology.

05:51.059 --> 05:56.465
And by that time, kind of the behavioral things 
were really beginning to take hold in business.

05:57.105 --> 05:58.847
There's still a lot of faddishness, I think the 
awakening that the human resource is the

05:59.384 --> 06:15.025
comparative advantage and we really need to find 
more effective ways to deal with and manage and

05:59.384 --> 06:15.025
lead the human resource. So we set up a pretty 
exciting

06:20.782 --> 06:26.975
employee relations research program by academic 
standards very applied, obviously. We were

06:27.717 --> 06:37.778
looking at things like job enrichment, job 
design, team building, leadership,

06:27.717 --> 06:37.778
compensation, employee turnover. So 
interesting practical problems. Some of it we

06:41.061 --> 06:43.183
farmed out to university people. Some we put in 
internal teams together. Exciting times. During

06:48.129 --> 06:56.698
that time, I had a chance to teach at Carnegie 
Mellon and kind of got excited about teaching. And

06:58.721 --> 07:08.271
I told my colleagues at PPG that at some point I was 
probably going to have to try that and they

06:58.721 --> 07:08.271
understood that. I think would have preferred 
that I stayed in

07:08.875 --> 07:15.485
Pittsburgh. Indeed, I had a job offer from 
Carnegie Mellon when I decided to go. But about

07:21.194 --> 07:34.174
that time, we went down and looked at the 
University of South Carolina, which was making a

07:21.194 --> 07:34.174
major commitment to build their business school, 
including their international dimension. And by

07:34.194 --> 07:37.279
this time, I'd also kind of become focused on the 
importance of international issues. PPG was

07:41.658 --> 07:50.727
becoming a major international participant and 
was learning some of the lessons the hard way. They

07:50.747 --> 08:00.657
had a few missteps abroad and basically were lack 
of understanding of the cultures in which they

07:50.747 --> 08:00.657
were going to operate. So anyway, that got me 
intrigued about that. Well, South Carolina was

08:03.980 --> 08:06.743
very intriguing. Kind of a new start, a very 
aggressive dean, a lot of support. So I joined the

08:13.587 --> 08:15.570
faculty there in 73. And one of the things we did was 
to start a center for management and

08:17.233 --> 08:21.820
organizational research. And we got some office 
and naval research funding. And so we had some

08:26.066 --> 08:30.874
really good experience there. We were 
well-funded, a good research program, began to

08:31.850 --> 08:37.041
attract some good students. Were you teaching 
also? Teaching, you bet, you bet, in the

08:37.662 --> 08:40.989
organizational behavior area. I think we had O&R 
funding the whole time I was there.

08:47.746 --> 08:50.028
So we were there seven years, 73 to 80. The 
international program was still doing very well.

08:53.252 --> 08:53.972
Absolutely. And I was just on the fringes of it. A 
fellow named Randy Foulkes was really the guru of

08:57.196 --> 09:01.941
it, still there. Very well conceived. A lot of time 
spent on thinking about what it ought to be. It was a

09:08.548 --> 09:10.049
very integrated program. It wasn't just a 
collection of courses. You took things, area

09:12.632 --> 09:15.795
study, for example, you'd look at the the culture, 
the economy, marketing strategies, all in kind of

09:16.079 --> 09:20.614
a module. So it was integrated and had a required 
language and a required internship requirement.

09:28.482 --> 09:30.224
When did Carlson leave? Carlson's daughter is 
over there right now. Yes. Just got to Paris, I

09:32.708 --> 09:35.692
think, for her internship. And they've been 
placing those students well, and I think in part

09:35.712 --> 09:47.148
because it's good quality content, but that 
internship does indeed set them aside, and

09:35.712 --> 09:47.148
they've had some hands-on experience. I've 
encountered their graduates just all over the

09:48.170 --> 09:50.693
place. The State Department seems to like them, 
Citicorp, some of the multinational firms.

09:57.558 --> 10:08.977
That's a good program, and I think by all accounts 
is clearly one of the top three international

09:57.558 --> 10:08.977
business programs now, which is good. And South 
Carolina has some strengths overall.

10:15.209 --> 10:15.910
They've kind of put it together. Not the 
university this is, but they have focused on some

10:15.930 --> 10:23.185
areas and done it very well, and that's one of them. 
So we stayed there 73 through 80 and thoroughly

10:23.205 --> 10:32.463
enjoyed South Carolina as a state and a place to 
live and a university and was growing. In 78, 79, we

10:32.964 --> 10:35.749
took Fulbright. Did you ever run into the 
librarian there, Ken Toombs? Yeah, yeah. Ken and I

10:40.774 --> 10:41.915
were real good friends. Is that right? Yeah, he was 
from the University of Southwestern Louisiana.

10:44.758 --> 10:45.619
How about that? Yeah, I hadn't thought of that name 
in a good while. Excuse me. In 78, 79 we took a leave

10:52.227 --> 10:59.256
and went on a Fulbright to Taiwan. That was a good 
year. I'd been promoted, and then the children

11:00.904 --> 11:06.069
were kind of young teenagers and pre-teen. So we 
thought if we were going to do it, that would be the

11:06.229 --> 11:09.673
time to do it. As you know, Fulbrights don't pay 
particularly well.

11:14.958 --> 11:21.205
But that particular year, for organizational 
psychology, I think there were only two. One was

11:21.545 --> 11:23.387
Taiwan, the other was Kiev. So our assessment was, 
well, it would probably be easier to get to Russia

11:24.397 --> 11:31.268
over the years than it was going to be to get to the 
Orient. So it turned out that may have been

11:31.288 --> 11:35.175
reversed. But we wouldn't change it. We had a great 
year, probably the best year we've ever had as a

11:37.078 --> 11:40.944
family. The girls were a little reluctant to go. 
And after flying, I don't know, 24 hours or

11:47.235 --> 11:50.961
whatever it took, to get there. We arrived and were 
taken to the wrong housing and just deposited by

11:52.357 --> 12:02.314
two young students who didn't have any better 
information than we had. So we felt very, very

12:02.915 --> 12:09.106
deposited in a very strange culture. So we flagged 
down a taxi and through pointing got to a hotel and

12:09.206 --> 12:16.999
slept for a day or two and found our way to the to the 
embassy and everything got straightened out. And

12:20.843 --> 12:27.991
from that point on, it was just a superb 
experience, culturally, educationally.

12:29.933 --> 12:33.857
The children, I think, learned to adapt very 
quickly. That's a good experience. Oh,

12:35.079 --> 12:35.759
absolutely. And the time they left, they were just 
so confident. You could see their growth over that

12:37.982 --> 12:39.904
time. Just very comfortable. I had picked up 
enough language to cope. So great year. Anyway, we

12:49.165 --> 12:51.207
came back to South Carolina then for a year. And at 
that point, I think I decided to sample some

12:51.267 --> 12:58.915
administrative kind of tracks. And one of the 
things available then was the department head in

12:58.975 --> 13:04.060
management at Texas A&M. And I'd known Don 
Helrigel for a long time. And it was clear

13:08.044 --> 13:15.792
nationally that this business school was coming 
to life in Texas. Exciting, oil was rising. So we

13:18.958 --> 13:24.527
came down, had a great visit, very impressed. Bill 
Mews was dean at the time and he had some excitement

13:24.567 --> 13:28.874
and vision. We met a lot of faculty that were 
excited about what was happening and could happen

13:28.914 --> 13:37.027
here at A&M. Through the PPG years, spent enough 
time down here, and we recruited a lot of people

13:41.388 --> 13:45.295
from A&M. We had some familiarity. I wouldn't say 
we really knew the university or its culture, but

13:48.901 --> 13:54.831
enough feel. But very impressed with what the 
business school hoped to do. So we decided to come

13:57.536 --> 14:05.910
here and did in the summer of 1980, and have been 
here since. No, and your progression quickly

14:07.038 --> 14:15.260
through the College of Business and what has 
happened to the College of Business maybe in those

14:07.038 --> 14:15.260
years. Well, as you know, the College of Business 
is one of the newer colleges in this university. It

14:20.855 --> 14:22.920
wasn't until, I guess, the mid-60s. when a lot of 
the change was occurring at A&M, that the business

14:23.407 --> 14:35.259
school was split off from, originally had been 
over in ag, and I guess really started as cotton

14:23.407 --> 14:35.259
accounting, if I may have read that in your book. 
Something like that. But then what I guess was a

14:38.842 --> 14:51.675
kind of a combination unit that was an arts and 
science unit, and then when John Peterson, John

14:38.842 --> 14:51.675
Pearson was dean, yeah, or the first dean, Things 
started to, I think, form. It really exploded. I

14:57.623 --> 14:59.845
guess that's about the only explanation. Yep. And 
I think I spent some time several years ago trying

15:00.886 --> 15:13.298
to, and before John died, I spent some time with him 
trying to reconstruct the dynamics of that era.

15:13.938 --> 15:19.063
Dick Winerdi and John Calhoun and some others have 
shared with me their perceptions. I think a

15:19.381 --> 15:20.142
couple. One, giving it a separate identity. Two, I 
think that John Pearson and some of the others that

15:23.527 --> 15:33.903
were kind of guiding it made some very important 
early hires and early decisions. You know,

15:34.945 --> 15:37.609
they've got George Rice here. George, with a 
doctorate from Stanford, just kind of set a tone.

15:45.326 --> 15:45.947
Absolutely. He said, you know, one A&M serious, 
and then they can hire a Stanford PhD. George's

15:51.774 --> 15:55.719
family was from here in the Valley, so I guess there 
were other variables. In

15:55.920 --> 16:05.672
my own mind, Don Hellriegel...

16:06.007 --> 16:12.736
probably Bob Strouser in accounting, Don Fraser 
and Pete Rose over in finance. Some of those

16:14.258 --> 16:21.709
earlier hires, it hadn't been that long ago, and 
these are still relatively young people. But

16:23.331 --> 16:29.179
those were people that were about the business of 
making a national reputation for themselves.

16:29.564 --> 16:42.279
knew how to engage in the scholarly activity, were 
committed to building an institution, committed

16:29.564 --> 16:42.279
to staying here, and they just planted the seeds. 
And I've skipped, I shouldn't even start down

16:43.821 --> 16:46.724
names. Tom Leland was a name during that 
transition period apparently very well known and

16:51.620 --> 17:06.685
respected in the accounting profession in Texas, 
and helped get the accounting program started,

16:51.620 --> 17:06.685
and that was really the base, I think, upon which 
the others, and today, our accounting program is

16:51.620 --> 17:06.685
well regarded. I think the college had some strong 
people who had national impact, and who were

17:12.713 --> 17:16.599
committed to building an institution here. Some 
very good moves were made, the notion of getting

17:18.743 --> 17:25.274
into business computing science, the 
application side, very early. The decision to

17:35.984 --> 17:42.911
This is more recent, to limit enrollment and not 
let it get totally out of control. Who was dean when

17:43.551 --> 17:44.773
you came? I was trying to think. When I came, it was 
Bill Mews. Yeah, Bill, sure. In fact, yeah, I

17:47.756 --> 17:48.837
followed Bill. Let's see, there have been very few 
deans. John Pearson, Clint Phillips, been acting

17:54.202 --> 18:00.048
a couple of times. Acting, that's right, for short 
term, yeah. Bill Mews may have been the next. He

18:04.939 --> 18:06.461
probably was, yeah. And then I think I followed 
Bill.

18:12.610 --> 18:14.032
When did you become dean? Oh, me, let's see. I'll 
get off your feet, but that's all right. Yeah, I'm

18:18.859 --> 18:20.942
not sure. Bill left and went to Ohio? Where'd he go? 
He went to the University of Akron. Akron,

18:26.881 --> 18:28.442
University of Akron, yeah, sure. Well, he went 
from dean, he went to be deputy chancellor first,

18:28.462 --> 18:35.349
or vice chancellor for a year or two, when Art 
Hanson was here. And then went from there to Akron,

18:36.670 --> 18:43.296
and now is president of Auburn.

18:43.437 --> 18:44.378
Good person. I think the business school, good 
curriculum, good faculty, I think it has kept its

18:53.018 --> 19:03.336
eye on quality,

18:53.018 --> 19:03.336
has earned the support of the business community.

19:07.142 --> 19:12.972
My guess is it's really sort of the third leg now of 
the university in the sense of the old ag

19:07.142 --> 19:12.972
engineering. I think it's really come on. Benton 
Coconut, I think it's just been. A superb dean.

19:21.702 --> 19:22.604
Just excellent. And what's happened over there in 
the last several years, I think the national

19:23.045 --> 19:30.299
reputation has finally taken hold. Good chairs 
and good scholarships. You bet. Those things

19:32.342 --> 19:33.445
really add up. Absolutely. Absolutely. As Dean, 
what were any special problems, encounters you

19:36.978 --> 19:41.023
had? Well, I think one, the rapid enrollment 
growth was a constant challenge. We were always

19:45.309 --> 19:52.318
chasing space and faculty positions, so getting 
enrollment growth under control was important.

19:53.620 --> 20:05.736
Two, the global economy was clearly upon us, so our 
need to do more, and I think we did make some

19:53.620 --> 20:05.736
progress in getting more of an international 
perspective into the curriculum. emphasizing

20:06.121 --> 20:08.663
getting a study abroad program. Third, resources 
clearly weren't keeping up as we moved further

20:08.703 --> 20:24.338
into the 80s, so the need to get organized for 
private support, and I think that effort got

20:08.703 --> 20:24.338
underway. And then the constant need to be 
recruiting good faculty and retaining them. We

20:34.336 --> 20:42.207
were still growing and still had faculty 
positions, so a lot of time and resources were

20:34.336 --> 20:42.207
being spent on recruitment and retention. And I 
think we have managed to attract some very good

20:42.267 --> 20:48.136
people. While you were dean, was Frank Vandiver 
president? Yes, he was. That's right. When I got

20:56.428 --> 21:00.073
here, In fact, I vividly remember that first fall, 
very early, the former students had a welcoming

21:01.572 --> 21:18.631
reception for department heads, and something 
was over at the Ramada, and Frank Hubert walked in

21:01.572 --> 21:18.631
and made an announcement. He was the new 
something, and I guess that was Jarvis Miller and

21:18.691 --> 21:28.002
Frank, and that would have been, I guess, fall of 
1980. as department head, and I had no idea what the

21:28.302 --> 21:34.590
significance of all this was until a number of 
months later. But that indeed was what was going

21:37.154 --> 21:41.139
on. Yeah, Frank was the... So you were dean until 
when?

21:49.009 --> 21:49.490
Let's see. Until 86, I guess. 86 or 87. Yeah, 
because I think I spent two years in the

21:58.728 --> 22:01.793
chancellor's office then. One or two. I think it 
was 86. And then went over to the, yeah, I was there

22:06.682 --> 22:12.432
two years. I'd been 86 to 88 in the chancellor's 
office. And when Perry Atkinson became

22:18.563 --> 22:21.208
chancellor, By that time, Bill Mews had gone on to 
Akron. So Perry was, I think, looking for someone

22:26.236 --> 22:36.470
to kind of oversee the academic side of things and 
invited me to join him. And with some trepidation,

22:38.193 --> 22:40.596
I guess. I wasn't sure about that. Probably 
rightfully so, in my guess.

22:46.785 --> 22:51.432
But I decided to take a look at that. And again, it 
worked out very well. I knew Perry, but not well.

22:58.952 --> 23:02.839
And just found him, to me, the salt of the earth. 
Just solid, honest, straightforward,

23:02.859 --> 23:07.767
hardworking guy. And I learned a lot about 
politics and about how you don't have to make a lot

23:08.607 --> 23:16.097
of noise to get things done. And Perry, I learned a 
heck of a lot from him. And I'm grateful for that

23:19.281 --> 23:21.945
opportunity. But it also broadened my horizons 
about a lot of the broader state and educational

23:21.985 --> 23:28.974
issues that were going on. And the South Texas 
discussions had started by then. So I was involved

23:33.219 --> 23:38.226
in some of that early discussion.

23:40.012 --> 23:53.128
clearly see more clearly some of the tensions 
between the agencies and the university and the

23:40.012 --> 23:53.128
so-called flagship university and the smaller 
campuses in the system. And it also, the resource

23:53.328 --> 24:03.640
constraints had begun to get serious in 85 
forward.

24:04.042 --> 24:10.370
And I got my first real dose of legislative 
interaction while over there. You spent much time

24:11.252 --> 24:12.433
in Austin? Yes. You were associate chancellor? I 
was, what do they call it? First year was deputy

24:16.819 --> 24:24.129
chancellor for academic affairs, I think. And 
then they changed the title to executive deputy

24:24.149 --> 24:28.294
chancellors. Perry spent an awful lot of time in 
Washington, appropriately, on federal issues.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.664
Second, he got an appointment to the National 
Science Board. So he had some important reasons to

24:38.405 --> 24:47.035
be gone, and I think what he wanted was just someone 
to be clearly delegated to. So I ended up with that

24:47.916 --> 24:54.484
title in 87, 88, I guess. But a good bit of time in 
Austin or working legislator, meeting with

24:55.122 --> 25:03.752
legislators. Did you meet with the regents also? 
Yeah, yeah.

25:10.519 --> 25:19.189
And that was one of the opportunities to interact 
with the regents.

25:20.165 --> 25:24.732
I think Perry took that responsibility seriously 
and personally, I think. And I think he said on many

25:24.752 --> 25:32.866
occasions that one group you just got to spend the 
time communicating with is Chancellor. And he

25:32.886 --> 25:39.056
said he'd seen enough here and elsewhere who 
neglected that link. And so I think he worked hard

25:39.557 --> 25:47.269
on staying in touch and communicating and 
visiting and going around visiting with regents

25:47.654 --> 25:51.942
and trying to keep them informed and advised. By 
this time, was there a pretty good accord or more or

25:52.483 --> 26:02.361
less tension between the main university, let's 
say, and the system? I think that tension's always

26:02.641 --> 26:06.107
there and will always be there. And as I've matured 
and talked with other presidents and chancellors

26:12.325 --> 26:22.769
around the country, I think any system where 
there's a large flagship or dominant flagship,

26:12.325 --> 26:22.769
that tension is there in some form and at some 
level. I think it works relatively better or more

26:23.430 --> 26:30.807
poorly depending on how well the people in, I 
think, the two key roles communicate. And they can

26:36.997 --> 26:39.700
make it work or they can make it not work. And I think 
it's working here and it will continue to work here

26:40.221 --> 26:45.447
because people want to make it work. It's kind of 
interesting in my mind that, you know, Vandiver

26:45.467 --> 26:54.037
was named, what, President of Texas A&M 
University and of the system, and then they went

26:45.467 --> 26:54.037
back to the chancellorship. No, I didn't know 
that. Yes. I didn't know that. I think given the

26:57.213 --> 27:11.798
size and complexity of the system and just the 
insatiable demands on time for the president of

26:57.213 --> 27:11.798
A&M, it would be inhuman and inappropriate. It 
was. That happened to a number of our former

27:12.178 --> 27:15.404
presidents and chancellors. I've heard that 
said, and I can understand that. It's just too

27:18.863 --> 27:20.385
much. And the roles are different as long as 
they're clearly defined. I sense, too, in a way

27:25.830 --> 27:41.626
that the new

27:25.830 --> 27:41.626
recruitment of the new institutions, the 
swelling of the system, really now defines it much

27:25.830 --> 27:41.626
more clearly than had been the case in the past. I 
think that and the symbolism of moving the system

27:41.706 --> 27:45.410
off this campus. I still remember Tom Harrington 
telling me, 70s at least, that the greatest

27:48.817 --> 27:55.706
mistake A&M made was not keeping Arlington and not 
moving the systems offices to Dallas. And I

27:55.966 --> 27:57.588
thought, Tom Harrington said that? This Aggie? 
Absolutely. And I think that will yet happen, not

28:00.071 --> 28:03.155
necessarily at Dallas. But I think at some point in 
the evolution, the system offices should be

28:03.175 --> 28:12.627
probably in Austin, I do think, or in Houston now. 
The center of gravity has shifted there. and that

28:17.251 --> 28:46.870
would be good for this campus and I think would make 
it easier for those that have to deal with the

28:17.251 --> 28:46.870
chancellor staff that has to be out and around the 
whole state or people coming in to visit the system

28:17.251 --> 28:46.870
would make it easier but that's somewhere down the 
road but I think physically having them off the

28:17.251 --> 28:46.870
size of the chancellor and I think there was a third 
important move and it was creation of the super

28:17.251 --> 28:46.870
dean deputy chancellor I'm not convinced that's 
the final form of that. But that was a lot better

28:49.994 --> 29:01.990
than the one where you had the agency head 
reporting to the chancellor, the dean reporting

28:49.994 --> 29:01.990
to the provost president, and faculty got in the 
middle. That was really bad. And then, you know,

29:03.392 --> 29:09.820
you had this joint appointment, and the agencies 
generally won those battles because they had the

29:03.392 --> 29:09.820
resources. The dean's over here trying to run a 
promotion tenure process without resources. And

29:15.491 --> 29:18.976
that led to some really, really unfortunate, I 
think, or bad things. Putting the dean agency head

29:19.778 --> 29:30.055
in one hat, as we have now in Hyler and Petticoat and 
Herzog, brings that matrix together. Now the

29:31.337 --> 29:35.824
communication has to be between those people and 
the provost. president, because the provost can

29:36.209 --> 29:40.614
get left out of the loop. Those people with their 
dual hack can go right to the chancellor. But

29:46.220 --> 29:54.508
again, I think it's working because we have good 
people being engaged, well-regarded, Eilers,

29:46.220 --> 29:54.508
Petticord, and Herb before him. So that'll work. 
Ideally, I think the agencies ought to be under the

29:55.569 --> 29:59.514
president. And that may or may not happen. There 
are reasons, important reasons, for keeping the

30:04.340 --> 30:09.207
agencies separate. They have separate agency 
status in the state budget and the state

30:10.189 --> 30:19.102
mentality, and that's very important for budget 
things. They're not in there competing with other

30:19.122 --> 30:21.426
sources. Second, they are allowed to keep their 
own indirect costs, unlike the university and

30:21.706 --> 30:27.515
research. Very important, significant. So we 
want to keep the identity. But the cleanest way, I

30:33.938 --> 30:59.552
think, would either be to make the president or the 
provost, either one, because they really report

30:33.938 --> 30:59.552
to the provost in their dean role, to make the 
president or provost a vice chancellor of the

30:33.938 --> 30:59.552
system, for example, where those people would 
report to that person in a system role and would

30:33.938 --> 30:59.552
accomplish the same thing. That would integrate 
it. That would integrate it. It is also true the

31:02.693 --> 31:07.778
agencies have statewide, and they're trying to 
help the other schools. So that's fine. But the

31:10.440 --> 31:16.606
reality is the bulk of the work is done by faculty on 
this campus who have two bosses. And that has to

31:18.248 --> 31:19.870
come together. It's working now. I don't think 
it's much better than I think it's probably ever

31:21.471 --> 31:24.334
been. I think it is. So there's no need to be 
precipitous. But I think some place down the road,

31:31.195 --> 31:47.979
put them under the university and try to protect 
their independent status, or take the president

31:31.195 --> 31:47.979
or provost and give them also a system hat that 
makes the ag and engineering agencies also report

31:31.195 --> 31:47.979
through that hat. And it wouldn't even take an 
office over there, it's just a paper reporting

31:48.740 --> 31:53.727
thing. which would make sure the provost, in 
particular, is in the middle of any academic thing

31:54.145 --> 32:00.116
that involves faculty here. But overall, I think 
it's very important. And the chancellor's role, I

32:04.264 --> 32:12.340
think, is essential in representing the whole 
system to the state and in championing the smaller

32:04.264 --> 32:12.340
schools. and then dealing with the board. As the 
growth of the system itself, how does that affect

32:17.293 --> 32:23.524
Texas A&M University, the main campus? Do you see 
it as being competitive or complementary? In

32:28.300 --> 32:35.268
theory it should be complementary, and in some 
ways we're seeing some of those advantages.

32:36.890 --> 32:39.092
Clearly there are opportunities for joint 
programs. Corpus Christi sitting down there on

32:40.253 --> 32:51.726
the ocean ought to be complementary with our 
Galveston oceanography programs here and

32:40.253 --> 32:51.726
atmospheric and the Gulf of Mexico kind of 
interest. Agriculture at ANI is very strong.

32:57.279 --> 32:59.522
They've got gas engineering down there. There are 
a couple interfaces. And that's true. I think if

33:02.987 --> 33:10.556
you looked at a matrix there, there are overlaps 
where there ought to be some synergy both ways. The

33:12.138 --> 33:20.329
cost of shared services, computer resources, 
library resources, as this electronic era

33:12.138 --> 33:20.329
advances, Those smaller schools are going to 
benefit from access here, but we're also going to

33:20.984 --> 33:26.251
benefit. I understand Corpus Christi has a superb 
collection of Texas, Texana kinds of things, and

33:27.012 --> 33:38.206
maps of old Texas and Mexico. Well, that will be of 
interest to people here. So our ability to share

33:40.649 --> 33:45.675
and access resources is a plus. Third, as the state 
becomes more diverse, and as it indeed is, the

33:46.330 --> 33:58.149
reality is there will be no racial ethnic majority 
in Texas probably around 2020. That's already the

33:58.189 --> 34:02.516
case in our urban areas. Texas A&M has to become 
more diverse. And if we don't, we're not going to

34:07.625 --> 34:09.688
have any political support. because the state 
leadership is already happening in the

34:10.124 --> 34:13.248
legislature. The legislature is more diverse, 
and they want to see that we're helping educate. So

34:20.197 --> 34:22.319
that's not to say a social statement. That's a 
political and economic reality. Well, these

34:25.824 --> 34:37.178
other schools can be feeders for us, that Laredo 
and A&I, high percentage Hispanic, Pan American,

34:25.824 --> 34:37.178
Prairie View, high percentage African American, 
if we can recruit some of their best and brightest

34:37.698 --> 34:45.594
into our graduate program, that should be a 
natural. That hadn't really occurred in

34:45.974 --> 34:50.744
significant ways yet, but it ought to as we get. Do 
you see the growth of Texas A&M assuming more and

34:51.105 --> 34:57.377
more the graduate role and being in effect a The 
mothership for these? Well, in part, but the other

34:59.803 --> 35:11.843
schools aspired to develop some graduate 
programming themselves, and they don't want, I

34:59.803 --> 35:11.843
think, us just to skim their best students. But I 
think the reality is this is a national,

35:12.183 --> 35:24.343
international university of some distinction 
getting better all the time, and good, strong

35:12.183 --> 35:24.343
academic students are going to want to the best in 
terms of peers and faculty and labs. So I think we

35:29.480 --> 35:30.882
will. But I don't think, I don't see our 
undergraduate mission diminishing. The goal has

35:37.572 --> 35:51.293
been for a number of years, and it preceded me, 
really I guess the Target 2000 thing that George

35:37.572 --> 35:51.293
Mitchell chaired, was to get to 25% graduate And 
we're a little over 20%, I think, now. So it's been

35:54.671 --> 36:01.321
slow, but we're probably on track for that. But I 
wouldn't see it going much beyond that. I think

36:04.325 --> 36:12.677
we'll still have a very large undergraduate 
program and a good mix. But I think this will be a

36:12.697 --> 36:16.082
place where students that have some academic 
strengths as well as leadership potential are

36:17.227 --> 36:25.600
probably going to migrate. How did you come to be 
president of Texas A&M? Well, there was a search

36:29.626 --> 36:40.382
committee, and I guess they recommended me, and I 
think at that time, I think Perry Atkinson, I think

36:29.626 --> 36:40.382
the chancellor was supportive, and that always 
helps, and Apparently enough of the regents were

36:40.818 --> 36:43.643
supportive. Were they looking for anything 
special? I don't know. My sense was, you know, if

36:47.109 --> 36:59.350
you looked around the country at that time, 
several presidents were named that had more of a

36:47.109 --> 36:59.350
business orientation or came out of business 
schools. And I think that probably was not By

37:01.608 --> 37:02.169
chance. I don't know if there was any conscious 
notion. But I think clearly the resource

37:06.754 --> 37:12.420
constraints were getting much more serious and 
tighter. And it was clear to all that we were going

37:13.221 --> 37:19.608
to have to do more in the efficiency kinds of 
things. Second, I think it was evident that public

37:21.770 --> 37:30.079
institutions like private were going to have to 
and have to take on more private fundraising. I

37:35.051 --> 37:36.833
happen to enjoy that part of the role. Some don't. 
So I think that, to the extent one enjoys the

37:40.237 --> 37:48.868
fundraising and the external role. Third, the 
legislative interface is clearly going to become

37:48.948 --> 37:56.978
more important and always important, but I think 
it is resources. we're getting tighter that be

37:58.055 --> 38:27.353
someone that liked you know wander around the 
halls or go visit legislators and then kind of dig

37:58.055 --> 38:27.353
into that that battle and then I think probably 
just someone who who appreciated the uniqueness

37:58.055 --> 38:27.353
of A&M and wanted to nurture its best but not you 
know not obviously not be resistant to change

37:58.055 --> 38:27.353
because change is gonna be inevitable but but but 
that appreciate that this is a special place, a

38:28.143 --> 38:36.658
unique place, and there are a lot of the 
dimensions, that uniqueness, that deserve

38:28.143 --> 38:36.658
preserving. So I guess those would be some of the 
variables, I would think, that might have played

38:37.259 --> 38:44.191
into the decision process. What was your biggest 
challenge as you walked into the president's

38:44.211 --> 38:47.897
office? I think probably the resource issue. We 
were coming off such a high in Texas in the early

38:54.940 --> 39:03.549
80s, and oil prices soaring and expectations so 
high. And this university has come so far and so

39:03.609 --> 39:11.537
quickly in terms of size and quality and impact. 
And I think just our expectations were so high and

39:12.218 --> 39:23.209
justifiable to kind of bring that to some kind of 
focus and more realistic level, that state

39:23.459 --> 39:42.000
support was not going to be what it had been, that 
the permanent fund was not going to be the source,

39:23.459 --> 39:42.000
and yet not destroy enthusiasm or momentum or 
optimism. So I think it was pretty clear by 88 that

39:42.020 --> 39:49.568
the resource issues were significant.

39:50.645 --> 39:56.712
The athletic situation was tenuous the day I took 
over. The day after I assumed office, I went to a

39:58.954 --> 40:02.678
meeting with the NCAA. That's been prevalent 
throughout Aggie history. Indeed. But I am so

40:09.526 --> 40:13.390
confident we have made such progress in that area. 
And we, as you know, have another situation going

40:13.410 --> 40:18.576
on right now. But I am firmly convinced that it is an 
isolated incident and not systemic. And then I'm

40:24.277 --> 40:31.492
extremely disappointed and frustrated and angry 
and all those things that we have another one. But I

40:32.755 --> 40:35.822
think the reality is that we really I know we have 
turned the corner that we are not far from being a

40:36.038 --> 40:42.546
model program. And that's going to show in the next 
couple of years. I'm just highly confident. But

40:48.313 --> 41:02.431
that makes it all the more frustrating that we have 
another incident now because it just distracts

40:48.313 --> 41:02.431
from time, from image, from what we're really 
about. And I think our coaches have demonstrated

41:06.380 --> 41:11.925
they can be highly competitive and can do an 
effective job without breaking any rules. So we

41:11.945 --> 41:19.592
don't need anybody out there, whether they're 
students or former students or anybody else,

41:11.945 --> 41:19.592
helping in ways that aren't needed. I understand, 
but I committed in 1988 to get my arms around it, and

41:21.073 --> 41:34.986
I thought we were almost there, but we're not there 
yet.

41:35.270 --> 41:52.572
Third,

41:35.270 --> 41:52.572
as kind of a personal issue, I wanted to also work 
with the faculty and others to further the

41:35.270 --> 41:52.572
international agenda of the university. By 
tradition, A&M was and is an international

41:53.633 --> 42:01.463
university, I think, through our land grant 
status. through just faculty interest in a lot of

42:01.898 --> 42:04.382
areas. So already, we were the head of many 
universities. But today, you can't go to a

42:07.947 --> 42:10.411
meeting. As you know, in higher education, people 
are talking about, how are we going to

42:10.471 --> 42:16.380
internationalize the curriculum? How are we 
going to get more students attuned to this global

42:16.400 --> 42:20.967
competition? Well, A&M is far down the road, far 
down the road. If we don't shoot ourselves in the

42:25.439 --> 42:33.288
foot, I think that all is going to take hold over the 
rest of this decade. We need to get a lot more of our

42:34.389 --> 42:39.434
students access to a study abroad, I believe. I 
think that's one of the most meaningful things.

42:41.597 --> 42:52.729
And I'm hopeful during this capital campaign, 
we'll get some significant infusion of endowment

42:41.597 --> 42:52.729
dollars to support students to take at least a 
summer where they can get an international

42:53.097 --> 42:57.022
experience. So you see this as one of the major 
future thrusts or directions that Texas A&M is

42:57.042 --> 43:04.072
going to take? Yes, because I think education, 
like business, by definition, is going to be

43:04.092 --> 43:10.079
global. I think where the knowledge is being 
generated or the nature of the significant issues

43:10.740 --> 43:21.855
being dealt with, all just transcends national 
boundaries. information network is right at the

43:22.932 --> 43:27.717
threshold. And we're all bitnetting now with 
colleagues around the world on our computers. And

43:33.964 --> 43:41.192
we'll be moving manuscripts and massive amounts 
of data around the world just so easily. And

43:41.733 --> 43:52.264
interactive TV is just around the corner that 
we'll be interacting live with colleagues in

43:41.733 --> 43:52.264
Japan or South America. So I think the whole nature 
of the way we communicate, the way we learn, the way

43:52.733 --> 44:01.504
we disperse knowledge is going to change. And it's 
going to be global. And indeed, our graduates are

44:03.326 --> 44:14.940
all going to be dealing, even though they may never 
work out of the country, they're going to be

44:03.326 --> 44:14.940
dealing with global economy, global 
transactions, global issues. And we need to

44:15.581 --> 44:18.424
further that. And I think we are. And one of the 
greatest disabilities liabilities in making

44:22.990 --> 44:25.534
that happen? Well, I think a couple. Just general 
resistance to change.

44:32.805 --> 44:41.178
Using

44:32.805 --> 44:41.178
old paradigms or old models or old stereotypes. 
When we started our campus in Japan, a lot of flack,

44:41.198 --> 44:46.987
reliving World War II. And that's understandable 
for families that had

44:53.062 --> 44:56.767
family members who fought in the Pacific or Japan. 
That's 50 years ago. That's a new world. And Japan

45:01.755 --> 45:10.047
is either going to be one of our major allies and 
trading partners, or it's going to be the dominant

45:01.755 --> 45:10.047
economic force in the world. Either way, we need 
to... I spent a few weeks over there. It was an

45:12.620 --> 45:16.428
incredible place. I was in the Navy, I guess, in the 
50s or something, and some Japanese officers came

45:16.468 --> 45:34.864
into our VOQ mess and sat down across the table, and 
one naval officer crawled across the table trying

45:16.468 --> 45:34.864
to get to that guy. So I know what you mean when you 
talk about the old models. Well, I think that's

45:39.957 --> 45:41.719
what, too, is resources. I think individually for 
a student or family to say, I want to spend a summer

45:41.739 --> 45:53.410
or a semester abroad, there's a marginal cost to 
that, or it may preclude them from working. So

45:55.232 --> 46:05.121
making it feasible, and then certainly 
programmatically for a faculty or department to

45:55.232 --> 46:05.121
have a major role abroad, it's been pretty good. So 
getting the resource base in place to help that

46:05.624 --> 46:10.316
occur. There are some bureaucratic things as 
well. The state of Texas a couple of years ago had

46:20.693 --> 46:29.304
policies in place which discouraged faculty to 
be, I mean, to get your foreign travel approved and

46:20.693 --> 46:29.304
go away to the governor. Gee, Christmas for a state 
that, I mean, we are an international state

46:29.925 --> 46:35.572
already. What are we, the 11th largest economy in 
the world if we were a republic? In and of itself,

46:39.977 --> 46:40.999
yeah. Major ports and major international 
companies and just So we are a global state, but we

46:46.276 --> 46:50.062
don't always recognize it. But it's coming, and I 
think we've got a role to educate the state and our

46:51.204 --> 47:01.181
legislature and others about what we are and what 
we can be as a state. What do you think A&M's great

47:02.163 --> 47:07.873
strengths are in this development? In the 
international? Yeah. Well, one, our graduates.

47:11.318 --> 47:14.844
Or that will not only carry us into the 
international, but just into the future. Into the

47:14.864 --> 47:15.444
future? Yeah. Well, that's the same answer. That 
would be, I think, our graduates. I think we are

47:20.472 --> 47:27.864
producing a good graduate that the external 
markets recognize. And those external markets

47:28.885 --> 47:33.693
are employers, they're graduate schools, 
they're professional schools. And I think our

47:34.815 --> 47:37.579
students are great.
