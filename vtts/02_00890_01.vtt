WEBVTT

00:04.334 --> 00:05.556
This is June 19th. I'm in the office of Paul Geisel 
at the University of Texas at Arlington. Paul is a

00:12.487 --> 00:17.295
full professor in the Urban and Regional Planning 
Program. Paul, first of all, when did you come to UT

00:19.037 --> 00:24.566
Arlington? I came here in 1970.

00:33.865 --> 00:34.986
When was that, Paul? 1970. Uh-huh. Where were you 
before? I was at Arizona State. In planning? No.

00:45.038 --> 00:47.100
No, I was in the Department of Sociology there. And 
before that, I was the director of the War on

00:48.802 --> 00:55.810
Poverty in Canada. In Canada? Uh-huh. Out of 
which... In Ottawa. Ottawa. Uh-huh. So I was a

01:00.896 --> 01:02.297
deputy minister there. I see. Are you Canadian? 
No, I'm not. I had come there. I was a chairperson of

01:08.691 --> 01:18.604
one of the Kennedy task forces on health services 
for the poverty program. And after Kennedy's

01:18.805 --> 01:30.060
assassination, one of the Canadians asked me if I 
would like to lead that program there, so I went

01:18.805 --> 01:30.060
there from the University of Pittsburgh. I see. So 
you have a degree in sociology from Pittsburgh. I

01:35.661 --> 01:41.308
have a degree in, yes, no, I have a degree in 
sociology from Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt. Mm-hmm.

01:44.391 --> 01:44.732
Okay. And a degree in mathematics from Chicago, 
and a medical degree from Chicago. That's quite a

01:51.139 --> 01:52.240
background. Yeah, well, I was a child when I 
graduated from college, so I couldn't get a job.

01:57.727 --> 01:59.429
You wouldn't want to know why I'm so educated. It's 
because I couldn't get employed. I got out of

02:00.923 --> 02:11.178
college when I was 16, so it's great to be a prodigy, 
but what the hell are you going to do with it? And

02:11.198 --> 02:18.810
now, in terms of the department here, what... You 
mean how do I get into this department? Yeah, what

02:18.830 --> 02:20.732
is your role in the department? Okay, I'm in the 
department for essentially two reasons. One...

02:25.645 --> 02:35.386
In the evolution of the urban affairs program here 
at UTA, it became clear to us that a planning degree

02:25.645 --> 02:35.386
of sorts was a necessary and important 
ingredient. So in 1972 or 73, I can't remember the

02:36.429 --> 02:43.464
exact dates. It could have been 74. actually came 
to fruition in 75. We started a process with the

02:48.848 --> 03:04.020
School of Architecture and several other 
departments of writing proposals, and I was the

02:48.848 --> 03:04.020
author with a fellow, Peter Stewart, over in 
architecture, of the original proposal for the

02:48.848 --> 03:04.020
MCRP at UTA. Now, that was in concert with a series 
of other degrees, and because of the kind of work I

03:04.040 --> 03:15.430
was doing as a sociologist, as a demographer in 
particular, it's kind of my area in mathematical

03:04.040 --> 03:15.430
sociology, and the kind of experience I was having 
working in smaller cities, I was doing a lot of

03:16.203 --> 03:26.439
planning, if you will, particularly in terms of 
social planning and population analysis.

03:30.405 --> 03:32.088
Well, it was a natural evolution. I'd also started 
writing planning manuals for small cities and how

03:35.221 --> 03:39.006
to train planning commissions. And we were doing a 
lot of that here. I had developed this emphasis in

03:43.812 --> 03:50.461
the small city areas and was very interested in 
seeing that they could develop a planning

03:43.812 --> 03:50.461
process. So my interest in the area, as well as the 
university responsibility of having an author,

03:50.481 --> 04:03.118
and an author with rank

03:50.481 --> 04:03.118
to the proposal, to carry the proposal. So the 
original idea then was to put it in architecture as

04:04.921 --> 04:09.626
a home. There's nothing unique about that. I 
didn't particularly care for it. I didn't think it

04:13.631 --> 04:17.916
was essentially appropriate at that time. But 
there was no place else to put it. That's when Hal

04:20.239 --> 04:22.081
Box was here. Yes. And Hal's an old friend, and 
looked like we had a pretty trustful

04:23.282 --> 04:28.228
relationship. It also looked, in the university 
setting at that time, as everyone knows in Texas,

04:30.048 --> 04:47.325
that whatever arrangement you made, we were also 
raw and knew that it really wasn't going to make

04:30.048 --> 04:47.325
much difference, that traditional academic 
games and the theocracies of the disciplines

04:30.048 --> 04:47.325
weren't going to be terribly painful here. Well, 
clearly we've matured, and clearly that was

04:48.446 --> 04:52.611
wrong. So, you know. They are painful, eh? Well, 
they are, and obviously they're You know, this

04:58.162 --> 05:01.626
university is just like all the rest of them. 
Maturity is a pain in the patuggies in terms of

05:01.646 --> 05:11.357
trying to be innovative, creative, and do some 
things a little differently, or at least be

05:01.646 --> 05:11.357
contemporary. So applied and professional 
programs will always struggle on any university

05:11.397 --> 05:16.963
campus.

05:20.066 --> 05:26.193
It's kind of a given that there will always be a 
little bit of indignity associated with it. Now,

05:26.213 --> 05:28.135
with planning, they're never sure. It has a 
certain ring of dignity about it that indicates

05:28.655 --> 05:34.846
there must be some theory there. And if they ever 
found out there wasn't, we'd all die. But at this

05:37.010 --> 05:40.215
point, at least, we can go through the illusion. 
It's good to have a course in your curriculum

05:40.235 --> 05:43.080
called planning theory. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. And then 
not acknowledge what it was at all. So just went

05:48.129 --> 05:50.173
through one, by the way, though, as I said. major 
kind of a question of theoretical perspective

05:50.542 --> 05:54.447
that you find. I've just returned. I've taken a 
class to Peru, and I've been taking classes abroad

05:55.788 --> 06:00.994
here recently. And without even thinking about 
it, our strategies theoretically for the

06:01.014 --> 06:14.490
resolution of almost everything now in housing, 
transportation, political process, you name it,

06:01.014 --> 06:14.490
is mainstreaming. is that you shouldn't build 
separate discrete units or try to organize

06:15.702 --> 06:22.428
utopias or new neighborhoods or anything of the 
sort. You really ought to integrate into the city

06:22.448 --> 06:28.114
and let the dynamics of the natural market flow 
kind of operate on it. And that way, people will

06:29.095 --> 06:31.657
integrate into the society. And the society is a 
self-healing phenomenon. That's our new theory

06:33.819 --> 06:37.222
out there, if you want a bottom line trash. How 
does, uh... I don't know how all that came about. We

06:41.286 --> 06:42.367
just bought into that one. But, you know, when you 
go abroad, they haven't bought it. Uh-huh. Well,

06:45.250 --> 06:54.363
does a person like Mel Weber and his philosophy of 
systems approach... Well, all of them, everybody

06:45.250 --> 06:54.363
confirms it now. But no one acknowledges that it's 
universal and that we just slipped into this one

06:55.444 --> 07:00.532
day. Obviously, you can defend it now that we've 
done it. I mean, clearly it's the right thing to do.

07:06.720 --> 07:14.852
But I haven't seen a single article that debates 
whether this is something we have to do in

07:06.720 --> 07:14.852
absolutely everything. This notion of the 
healing society out there, the race, see, here

07:15.457 --> 07:20.944
come our people. Anthony Downs says, well, if you 
dismiss black people out there in suburbia, the

07:21.525 --> 07:27.392
race issue will go away. Well, thank you, Anthony. 
I don't have to buy into that one. You got deaf kids?

07:32.679 --> 07:38.066
Well, the problem is they find out if they study 
only with deaf people, they find out they're deaf.

07:38.566 --> 07:41.931
So it's better to keep them in public school with 
all the rest of them, see? So it's universal.

07:43.402 --> 07:48.327
Housing, well, you shouldn't have public housing 
anymore, or you shouldn't build separate. You

07:48.347 --> 07:50.249
should build on the street the same. Hey! And then 
let the market factors... So it's the same... It's

07:54.653 --> 07:57.977
the melting pot taken to the absurd extreme. Oh, as 
a matter of fact, no, it's the manipulated melting

07:58.097 --> 08:00.659
pot. And that the melting pot will, in effect, be a 
positive resolution, or at least a resolution

08:01.200 --> 08:09.508
appropriate to the political social realities of 
our world. That doesn't mean it's going to be a

08:09.969 --> 08:12.351
solution, however. Well, I don't know. But it hits 
you in the face that when you go abroad,

08:13.709 --> 08:31.998
we just had a meeting with Belunde here, who's an 
architect planner, and he's built 175,000 units

08:13.709 --> 08:31.998
of housing in the last four years. Doing fine. In 
this dirt, he's building. Where is he building? In

08:35.904 --> 08:36.325
Peru. One of the poorest countries in South 
America. Oh, yes and no. It all depends on which

08:40.963 --> 08:44.688
economy you wish to measure. The informal economy 
is doing bad. Something's going on. But one of the

08:49.915 --> 08:52.819
neighborhoods that we went to see is called Lima 
Tambo. He took us there. And here's a neighborhood

08:54.962 --> 08:57.806
that they've built. Visually, you can see it. It 
would be very helpful as planning educators for us

09:06.157 --> 09:11.562
not to individually, as departments, determine 
what we think is appropriate. Now, there's a

09:11.582 --> 09:14.065
little bit of that, of course, which is obvious. We 
have a local market which dominates it. Probably

09:17.148 --> 09:20.871
you guys at A&M don't have a local market. But we 
clearly do with the Nellis-Fort Worth and this

09:20.931 --> 09:31.962
broader north central Texas kind of an issue, 
essentially growth being our critical concern.

09:32.245 --> 09:37.491
Also the small city thing, which I mentioned 
earlier, I think that's kind of our arena. But

09:37.511 --> 09:44.279
really what would be helpful is to sit down and do a 
needs determination statewide and decide who

09:37.511 --> 09:44.279
does what best. In terms of skills, I think they're 
essentially the same for all students. They

09:47.763 --> 09:50.466
really ought to know how to work with micros today. 
They ought to know what the database systems are.

09:53.530 --> 09:57.434
Subdivision planning and that kind of trash and 
planning, I think we've kind of moved beyond. But

09:58.275 --> 09:59.957
they ought to know something about that. They 
certainly should know the legal characters and

10:00.207 --> 10:03.791
planning administration. So there are basic 
theoretical and skill courses. But then the

10:06.935 --> 10:09.418
emphasis areas, I think, are unique. I think they 
certainly should know about the history of

10:09.718 --> 10:12.542
planning. Absolutely. Well, they need to know all 
the professional stuff that appropriately

10:13.543 --> 10:22.634
identifies them with this as a meaningful field. 
It would be my goal that every student would turn

10:22.834 --> 10:30.163
out a thesis or some kind of a product that would be 
appropriate for APA something of that sort. So

10:31.985 --> 10:35.691
they are eligible members of the professional 
community, you mentioned. For our M.U.P. degree,

10:37.494 --> 10:41.199
we require a professional paper in the last 
semester now. Well, I think that... It's not a

10:42.461 --> 10:44.744
thesis, but it's sort of... I don't care. Like, 
instead, we don't want to call it a thesis, because

10:45.325 --> 10:49.472
then we'd have to go through the graduate college. 
And we'd have to take attention to the margins.

10:53.417 --> 10:54.840
Well, we're agreeing to all of that. I don't care 
from a university perspective where we are. But in

10:58.685 --> 10:59.847
terms of their... Whether they give a full paper or 
whatever, they ought to, in my mind, be at APA for a

11:01.244 --> 11:09.816
professional reason, as a panelist, as a paper 
presenter. And they ought to have written

11:10.778 --> 11:13.902
something that was submittable to it, whether 
they go or not. That's another choice. So those

11:16.586 --> 11:20.772
things, I think, are common to all the 
departments. You mentioned one thing, that you

11:21.443 --> 11:32.140
thought it would be good for the planning schools 
to confer and make a decision about which one would

11:21.443 --> 11:32.140
be teaching which subject. Well, here's where 
I... No, I think there are emphasis areas of

11:32.160 --> 11:48.565
specialties that, by all of us covering every 
waterfront, economic, development, political,

11:32.160 --> 11:48.565
you know, etc., none of us are doing very well, if 
you want my candid opinion in terms of the

11:32.160 --> 11:48.565
challenges in Texas. For example, the whole area 
of economic development now, which is a major

11:49.203 --> 11:59.674
issue in city after city, we're finding they're 
hiring people from out of state or from other kinds

11:49.203 --> 11:59.674
of divisions. That disappoints me. We should have 
anticipated that ourselves as a profession and

12:00.895 --> 12:08.283
grabbed it. Would you call, then, for a conference 
of planning faculty and directors? If we could do

12:13.449 --> 12:16.712
that without this one-upmanship, And I really 
feel like we're kind of beyond that. I don't know

12:21.686 --> 12:29.821
why I find it unpleasant to deal with the Austin 
people periodically, but they do have an attitude

12:21.686 --> 12:29.821
problem. And they kind of need to get rid of it. 
Well, they're not the only school that has people

12:34.883 --> 12:41.591
who have very definite ideas. Oh, I don't care 
about that. I can deal with that. Because some of

12:45.616 --> 12:52.945
them also have such non-voyant personalities 
that you can just ignore them or whatever and say,

12:45.616 --> 12:52.945
fine, that's just fine, you turkey. And frankly, 
you know, A&M has a number of those as well. Those

13:00.128 --> 13:04.895
are some of our flamboyant characters, and I don't 
give a crap about that. If that means that you have

13:05.256 --> 13:12.867
the skill to uniquely offer something better than 
I, we're all going to cover everything. Give me a

13:12.927 --> 13:14.209
break. But if you wanted a special, if your goal was 
to be a small city planner, for example, I think we

13:23.973 --> 13:27.076
offer the best access for it. Now, if your idea is 
statewide or regional planning, we're just in on

13:27.096 --> 13:34.705
that one. Don't put that on the tape. Erase that 
from the tape. It's on the tape. But you

13:38.068 --> 13:41.492
understand. We have a course in regional 
planning. I don't even think we describe or

13:44.335 --> 13:49.761
identify what a region clearly is. And A&M, I 
think, is strong on planning law and land

13:50.298 --> 13:57.244
development and transportation. All right. 
We're fair in transportation. And history. We're

14:00.447 --> 14:01.488
very big in history. Those are not, we cover them. 
But if we came down there, then we could see what we

14:05.852 --> 14:10.576
were missing and we could probably recruit to the 
state. And we could, you see, one of the advocacies

14:12.678 --> 14:17.723
also that's necessary, you know this as well as I, I 
have to stop through city halls in this region

14:18.091 --> 14:31.397
continually to look at their work job 
descriptions and discover that these degrees

14:18.091 --> 14:31.397
disappear as a part of the description with 
regularity. Good point. We try to assume that

14:34.022 --> 14:38.190
we're in a very stable employment market. Well, 
forget it. They feel that if you're not

14:40.822 --> 14:48.971
exclusively in the Department of City Planning 
doing subdivision review or something trivial of

14:40.822 --> 14:48.971
that sort, you're not. It's not a planner. The fact 
that you might go into the Department of

14:52.015 --> 15:04.590
Transportation, the Department of Water, Sewer, 
Public Works even, in terms of the planning

14:52.015 --> 15:04.590
components, we fight that war every day. Good. 
That's great. Now, I do it by simply walking

15:07.670 --> 15:16.369
through the city hall and calling for the job 
descriptions, and I find the degree in planning

15:07.670 --> 15:16.369
slips out of there very quickly. The second thing 
is the advocacy of what is a planner. It used to be an

15:19.616 --> 15:22.863
ugly word. We all know that. I mean, for Christ's 
sake. Well, it's kind of legit now. You think it is?

15:29.231 --> 15:29.972
Oh, yeah. Planning has come back into its own? Oh, 
yeah, but the neighborhood movements and things

15:31.974 --> 15:40.503
like that in Dallas and Fort Worth and here, we're 
clean because the planners are citizen

15:31.974 --> 15:40.503
advocates. I mean, see, we went through that wave, 
and so the people we have placed out there, because

15:40.904 --> 15:54.358
of that wave of the intellectual movement, you 
know, when everything was citizenship, well,

15:40.904 --> 15:54.358
those are our senior planners in this region now as 
our graduates. So we have dignity, because we have

15:56.185 --> 16:01.397
this citizen political force hitting the fan at 
the same time. Now, any of them write, well, I don't

16:01.939 --> 16:04.104
care. We're just very popular. Now, is there any 
money? Well, forget it. But are we doing good? Hey,

16:10.659 --> 16:12.203
we're hot. Well, that's interesting because I 
hadn't been aware of this sort of swing back to

16:12.993 --> 16:19.342
popularity. Well, with the folks. I can remember 
back in 1953 when I entered planning, planners

16:20.784 --> 16:25.632
could do no wrong. Oh, they were gods. Well, we had a 
mystique surrounding us. Oh, yeah. And no one even

16:29.477 --> 16:31.540
dared question that mystique. Listen, I worked 
with Cal Hamilton for years. Oh, did you? Oh, yeah.

16:35.186 --> 16:35.767
In Los Angeles? No, I worked with him in Pittsburgh 
before he got fired there. Uh-huh. Oh, it was

16:39.212 --> 16:40.013
wonderful. As a matter of fact, my prior book, I had 
a million dollar grant from Cal. Do you like that

16:44.805 --> 16:45.526
one? To simulate the city. Holy banana. Because we 
had that arrogance in those days. That was 64, 65.

16:52.975 --> 16:54.977
Yeah, we did have a lot of arrogance. Yeah, and 
well, you want to know what else? I believed it was

16:58.081 --> 16:59.363
possible. Well, you probably know all about Brett 
Harris, though. Oh, yeah. And his dog and pony

17:03.968 --> 17:05.410
show. about regional science, he would drag 
around the country. Well, we all were. All of us

17:09.957 --> 17:22.753
were stomping around America, and of course the 
reality is we were probably right, but we were way

17:09.957 --> 17:22.753
ahead of our methodological skills to make it all 
possible. It really was a nonsense period, but it

17:22.773 --> 17:25.176
was fun. Oh, yeah. And trashy comedy at the same 
time is, I believed it was feasible. I mean, I could

17:31.478 --> 17:35.762
laugh over the absurdity of these things today. 
They really weren't absurd. They were feasible,

17:39.847 --> 17:46.854
but no one wished to really acknowledge that the 
databases were the pits. They were built upon

17:48.135 --> 17:52.940
information that no more predicted a kind of a 
logic. It was built on so many assumptions. My best

17:56.483 --> 18:00.167
model was Tom. You had the name Tom. The 
time-oriented metropolitan model. Well. Have

18:06.986 --> 18:07.767
you heard of PLUM? Oh, no, what's PLUM? PLUM is 
Projective Land Use Model. Oh, I like that. Well, I

18:12.632 --> 18:16.977
had PUMP as well, the Phoenix Urban Minorities 
Program. Ah, yes. We were still priming it when I

18:18.239 --> 18:19.960
left. Yes. Well, anyway. My biggest study, by the 
way, was Nipple. The National Inventory of Poor

18:27.554 --> 18:31.720
People's Lives and Evaluation. And the 
government had a conniption fit over that, so we

18:32.822 --> 18:36.327
changed it to CUPS. Canadian Urban Poverty Study. 
And they didn't like that, so we went to UPS. And

18:41.795 --> 18:43.638
they kept telling me, you're really obscene.

18:46.142 --> 18:47.684
So we ended with New Life. New Life. The National 
Low Income Family Evaluation. Then I found out

18:52.812 --> 18:55.536
that was a program in Vietnam, so it just I was 
ruined. Just ruined. Must have been frustrating.

19:01.169 --> 19:06.281
Well, if you name these studies, you can get 
anything. Tom really was a good grid model.

19:19.073 --> 19:27.704
I legally am, but actually I don't participate 
that much in terms of the planning for the

19:19.073 --> 19:27.704
department because my degree isn't in planning. 
My primary appointment isn't in that department.

19:31.088 --> 19:32.470
What is your primary appointment? Oh, it's in 
urban affairs. Would you explain to me the

19:35.054 --> 19:38.097
difference between... Urban affairs and urban 
planning? Yeah, are they both departments or are

19:38.158 --> 19:40.481
they... They were. At this point, we all seem to be 
one glorious faculty. How many are there? How many

19:47.795 --> 19:48.656
faculty? 12. 12. Do you know how many students you 
normally enroll in the programs? I know for urban

19:58.549 --> 20:00.852
affairs, I can't tell you for planning. I don't 
know how many there are close to it. I think there

20:03.094 --> 20:05.397
are about 50, 55 in planning. We have in the MA in 
urban affairs, 58. And in the PhD program, about 60

20:10.444 --> 20:15.550
at this time. 60? Uh-huh. Then for those who come in 
for what we give corollary degrees, we give an MA in

20:16.904 --> 20:35.014
MSW, an MA in Urban Journalism, which we kind of are 
running but has not been completely approved by

20:16.904 --> 20:35.014
the Coordinating Board, and then MA with Urban 
Education. So those constitute another about 20

20:35.703 --> 20:40.451
students, then the interdisciplinary students 
that come. I see. So we only have graduate students

20:41.833 --> 20:45.098
here in this entire faculty. There are no 
undergraduate courses whatsoever. You don't

20:47.322 --> 20:50.207
have any service courses for undergraduates? Not 
a one. Now, we did for a while. And we've tried that

20:53.111 --> 21:02.166
angle principally as a kind of a feeder mechanism 
to encourage students to major. That simply

21:03.074 --> 21:04.115
didn't work. Now, we also give city planning 
courses here in the College of Engineering.

21:08.481 --> 21:10.925
They're not really competitive. They are 
engineering courses to a large extent. And it

21:14.109 --> 21:17.433
hasn't really been a very big issue. But my role 
with the planners here has been, even as a member of

21:18.194 --> 21:29.129
that faculty, not to go to their meetings unless 
they just needed my insight. You go to the

21:29.189 --> 21:32.153
Sociology Institute meetings? yes if i go to any 
and i go to urban affairs association which is a

21:32.369 --> 22:00.385
small group and i go to apa and i go to the american 
population association

21:32.369 --> 22:00.385
that's kind of you know it's enough is enough yeah 
you can get drowned oh yeah believe me apa is enough

21:32.369 --> 22:00.385
oh and of course i go to that one out of kind of 
fascination i've usually gone because i was

21:32.369 --> 22:00.385
getting a paper or presentation and have been 
active periodically with the local chapter. Our

22:04.068 --> 22:05.369
students kind of dominate it. It's a big chapter. 
The northern section. Uh-huh, sure. And so I have

22:12.015 --> 22:16.279
periodically been active, but in the last two or 
three years, really not. What is your perspective

22:17.260 --> 22:24.146
on what they're doing in Austin with their 
planning program? Do you have any facts to hold on

22:24.306 --> 22:27.329
that? The thing is that Most of my concerns, I 
think, really were registered in the first part of

22:30.183 --> 22:34.130
this conversation. I wish someone would sit down 
and realize what the state's needs really were,

22:35.252 --> 22:45.532
and could help us establish a research and 
placement agenda. I've never really known what

22:46.954 --> 22:49.118
they teach. Well, that's where I am. I always feel 
like we're contemplating the theories of Mao.

22:54.196 --> 22:56.759
from that going into a kind of a philosophical way. 
And you say, who's going to hire these turkeys?

23:00.283 --> 23:10.634
We're in a staging in Texas of trying to bring urban 
spaces along, trying to give them an essential

23:00.283 --> 23:10.634
concept that you can get control of ordinances. 
You can get control of streets. You can get control

23:12.175 --> 23:13.957
of water, et cetera. And it'll pay you to do it. Now, 
we're just at that still initial stage. My

23:21.555 --> 23:37.970
analysis of manpower needs, which I did about four 
years ago for planners as a part of a larger study,

23:21.555 --> 23:37.970
was that if we could show them what they need, we 
have about 4,000 positions open in this state that

23:21.555 --> 23:37.970
meet those kinds of demands. But we haven't 
examined how to fit that, how to match it. Also, we

23:46.475 --> 23:52.685
haven't really told our students where these jobs 
are or how to get them. We've had good liaison with

23:52.705 --> 23:58.053
the Texas cities. We've had no difficulty with our 
planning departments. I don't mean the League of

24:02.600 --> 24:04.483
Texas cities. Yes, sure. But this has only been on 
legislative matters. Sure. The state

24:08.109 --> 24:11.554
legislature has not been with their local units, 
their memberships. And maybe it should work the

24:11.990 --> 24:13.912
other way. We should be working with the league in 
terms of disseminating the need for getting

24:14.052 --> 24:23.362
planning degrees as part of the job description. 
Even for, say, consultants. Yes, consultants. In

24:26.886 --> 24:33.052
this area, consulting firms constitute almost 
50% of the employment for planners. And of course,

24:33.793 --> 24:36.756
anyone can put planning in their title. Thank you 
very much. And we should be preparing specially

24:38.939 --> 24:42.767
for that. One of my students works for Segal 
Associates, which is a national real estate

24:42.787 --> 24:48.318
developer, evaluator, planner. Segal? Segal. 
They do the Segal newsletters. Oh, not Ladislav

24:51.945 --> 24:53.649
Segal. No. No. Nothing that noble or ennobling. 
And so... But that kind of research in real estate

25:02.716 --> 25:13.337
research, for example, which is appropriate for 
our kinds of students, we really haven't tackled

25:02.716 --> 25:13.337
that market. And we're in a data shortage right 
now, which is unreal. What ever happened to the

25:18.286 --> 25:20.711
1985 census? What ever happened to the 1985 
census? for example. Whatever happened to that?

25:26.459 --> 25:29.743
We were going on the five-year cycle, and then we 
didn't go on the five-year cycle. Exactly. And no

25:30.885 --> 25:33.007
one ever even mentioned it. Now, we did in the 
American Population Association. Did you? Oh,

25:35.631 --> 25:36.612
yeah. What was the answer? Mr. Reagan was elected. 
Oh. Pardon me, I've got dry eyes. That explains a

25:42.479 --> 25:43.861
lot of things. Yeah, that's what happened. That 
was very simple. We lost the Biden. And the

25:48.506 --> 25:52.551
question mark was, did we spend the money then for a 
bad census? which was only going to give us total

25:53.189 --> 26:03.503
count, and possibly raise, or, which wasn't very 
hot, because you weren't going to get an age break

25:53.189 --> 26:03.503
out, and what were you going to be able to do with it? 
So, or would you save the money, hide it, realizing

26:03.563 --> 26:13.017
that the same budget's coming up for the 1990 
census that was there for 1980? You got the picture

26:13.257 --> 26:15.740
now? So we took the 85 money and hid it. I won't ask 
any more questions. Well, that's where it is.

26:26.159 --> 26:32.999
Demography Magazine discussed this in the last

26:26.159 --> 26:32.999
issue. Is this enough for you? Because I need to 
take this.
