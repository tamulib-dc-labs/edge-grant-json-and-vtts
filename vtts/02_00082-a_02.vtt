WEBVTT

00:03.828 --> 00:06.772
But I was hoping we would get this kind of information.

00:07.833 --> 00:09.696
So you did well that first semester overall?

00:10.076 --> 00:13.420
Overall, first semester, I think, well we were on a three-point system.

00:14.081 --> 00:18.707
I think I posted a one-seven-fifth, okay, which was good for me.

00:19.929 --> 00:26.858
And I started to get involved in different activities here on the campus.

00:26.878 --> 00:32.265
I was trying out for the freshman drill team and made the freshman drill team.

00:32.650 --> 00:44.147
on the fish drill team, and then I joined some of the organizations that were in place here.

00:44.708 --> 00:53.882
At that time, they had hometown clubs, belonged to the San Antonio NM Hometown Club, was active during the four years that I was here in the San Antonio NM Hometown Club.

00:54.368 --> 01:05.205
So I met a lot of A&M San Antonio Aggie buddies, and that was one way that we could get rides back and forth because we didn't have cars.

01:05.245 --> 01:06.266
Very few people had cars.

01:06.707 --> 01:13.337
Describe the routine, because I don't have anybody yet that has, that I've been aware has been on the fish drill team.

01:14.599 --> 01:15.921
How were you all selected?

01:16.022 --> 01:17.704
What was the practice routine?

01:17.764 --> 01:19.407
Where did you all perform?

01:19.507 --> 01:22.131
Describe the drill team.

01:22.972 --> 01:35.352
When, I guess, during the first week that we were here, they made announcements in the mess hall and told us that the fish drill team were, tryouts for the fish drill team were going to take place certain days.

01:36.133 --> 01:38.297
So I said, well, I'm going to try.

01:38.317 --> 01:44.267
So there's about, like, maybe four or five central guys that went out.

01:45.268 --> 01:48.253
And so I figured, well, this

01:48.233 --> 01:49.455
a big deal, you know?

01:49.975 --> 01:54.121
I figured that, I mean, there's not going to be that many people who want to be on this.

01:54.681 --> 01:55.743
Go out there or not.

01:55.763 --> 01:58.987
I mean, there's like about 200 trying out for the fish drill team.

01:59.688 --> 02:06.216
So, they start drilling you, and they kind of put you in groups, okay?

02:06.977 --> 02:07.778
If you were

02:08.365 --> 02:14.892
If you knew how to march or you had that type of training, previous training, then they put you in a certain group.

02:14.912 --> 02:17.735
And then they started pulling people out.

02:18.155 --> 02:27.385
So the first day I was there, they went ahead and selected me to be on, just that I was going to be on the fish drill team, okay.

02:27.865 --> 02:38.136
And so one of my best buddies that was also from Central, Richard Alvarado, was also picked.

02:38.673 --> 02:57.407
And I think we were picked because I remember the sponsor, we didn't call them hounds back then, we called them, they were advisors, okay, which was, he was the fish drill dean commander from the previous year.

02:57.640 --> 03:05.513
And he came up and he asked me, you know, asked me what my name was.

03:05.573 --> 03:08.377
And so, of course, I whipped out Fish Garcia yet.

03:08.397 --> 03:10.200
And so he said, where are you from?

03:10.220 --> 03:11.242
I said, San Antonio, sir.

03:11.302 --> 03:14.367
And he asked me, he says, have you

03:14.836 --> 03:17.119
were you on a drill team in San Antonio?

03:17.159 --> 03:17.860
And I said, yes, sir.

03:18.701 --> 03:20.443
He says, we're at Central Catholic.

03:20.523 --> 03:22.566
And he said, come with me.

03:23.347 --> 03:32.498
See, because Central Catholic, the drill team at Central Catholic was very well known, and they had been state champions and all that kind of stuff.

03:32.598 --> 03:41.569
So I mean, most of us that had been in that group pretty well knew how to drill with a rifle and we knew how to

03:41.549 --> 03:43.032
how to march, you know.

03:43.052 --> 03:45.696
So actually we were good at drill.

03:45.716 --> 03:50.124
And so they pulled us out and they started lining us up.

03:51.486 --> 03:56.815
And then until they got to a group of about like 45 or so in that area.

03:56.835 --> 04:01.002
We had actually 40 were the actual marching unit.

04:01.022 --> 04:05.189
And then we had a few guys that were like reserves, not many.

04:05.650 --> 04:07.253
It wasn't a big group.

04:07.368 --> 04:10.792
And so during that week, it was intense.

04:10.812 --> 04:16.200
They drilled, they drilled, they drilled, they drilled, trying to decide who was going to stay and who they were going to keep.

04:16.220 --> 04:18.202
And then the ones that didn't make it, well, they didn't make it.

04:18.282 --> 04:22.027
But so then after they, we didn't even drill with a rifle.

04:22.428 --> 04:23.509
We just drilled.

04:24.590 --> 04:37.307
Manual arms or something that if you didn't, they didn't even look at it, they figured they'd teach you how to do that, even if you didn't know, if you had no previous drill with a rifle.

04:38.722 --> 04:46.469
That whole week, finally, we get into a position where we have to select our fish drill team commander.

04:47.370 --> 04:53.036
And so, oh, God, I don't know how many guys wanted to be the fish drill team commander.

04:53.056 --> 05:05.708
Of course, you know, it was a prestige position because you had to get the opportunity to wear a saber, and the only freshman on the campus that would wear a saber with a fish drill team.

05:06.245 --> 05:13.196
I would say there was probably about eight to ten of us that tried out for or wanted to be.

05:13.216 --> 05:18.425
So what we did, we drilled the troops, drilled the drill team around and come back.

05:18.485 --> 05:23.193
And so it was by vote of the members.

05:24.515 --> 05:26.498
And so we had this young man

05:27.119 --> 05:28.482
that had been in the Marine Corps.

05:29.805 --> 05:34.715
And he was already 21, 22 years old at the time.

05:34.955 --> 05:35.557
He was a fish.

05:36.559 --> 05:37.541
He was already married.

05:37.681 --> 05:38.323
He had a son.

05:38.383 --> 05:46.680
And he decided to come to A&M.

05:47.960 --> 05:54.512
It went down to where it was between Ben, not both of them, Ben Rice.

05:54.792 --> 05:55.834
Rice was his last name.

05:56.195 --> 05:56.776
I remember that.

05:57.056 --> 05:57.958
I can't remember his first name.

05:59.060 --> 06:00.502
And myself, the two.

06:01.364 --> 06:08.837
And he was selected to be the drill team commander.

06:09.155 --> 06:12.481
then they decided, well, we need to have a guide-on-bearer, you know.

06:12.501 --> 06:15.065
So, do you know how to do that?

06:15.205 --> 06:16.107
Well, let's try out for that.

06:16.207 --> 06:17.669
I said, I'll try out for that, you know.

06:17.689 --> 06:20.774
So, I wound up being a guide-on-bearer.

06:20.794 --> 06:24.480
So, we would drill every day.

06:24.521 --> 06:28.828
About how long and where?

06:28.888 --> 06:31.392
After classes, five o'clock.

06:31.893 --> 06:33.255
We would

06:33.573 --> 06:50.097
the quad back here we would go to the quad our rifles were in an armory down at the quad and we would go pull our rifles and then we'd drill from five to about 6 30.

06:51.359 --> 06:57.549
And then we would put the rifles up and we'd go to Duncan and we'd have dinner there.

06:57.770 --> 06:59.393
We would eat with the athletes.

07:00.575 --> 07:03.319
See, so we didn't have any upperclassmen supervision.

07:03.339 --> 07:13.857
So that was what was great because at least we knew one meal during the day was going to be great because we didn't have to worry about the upperclassmen being there.

07:13.837 --> 07:31.070
Of course, we had waiters at that time, so normally we'd always get an upperclassman waiter who would always make sure that we, you know, he'd give us a little static and make sure that we wouldn't get out of hand and we'd sit at attention and eat and that kind of whatever.

07:31.550 --> 07:37.161
Back in your outfit, did it give you prestige to be in the fish drill team?

07:37.141 --> 07:37.943
Yes.

07:38.243 --> 07:48.023
Anything that you, extracurricular activity that you belong to, gave your outfit points for the General Moore Trophy.

07:48.043 --> 07:53.956
So being that I was a guide on bear and was on the fish drill team was a plus.

07:54.276 --> 07:56.601
Now I might mention to you that

07:56.952 --> 08:00.300
That didn't mean anything to the upperclassmen, you know, mainly the sophomores.

08:00.560 --> 08:06.454
And in fact, that could kind of work against you because they'd figure, well, you think you're better than anybody else.

08:06.574 --> 08:12.067
So you had to kind of prove yourself that, hey, over there's one thing, over here's another, right?

08:12.588 --> 08:14.893
So you kind of like...

08:14.873 --> 08:16.776
You had to prove yourself in two areas.

08:16.917 --> 08:21.485
One is a member of the fish drill team and one is a member of your outfit, my squadron.

08:22.306 --> 08:31.623
And so the first sergeant was always very, he was a fair person.

08:32.845 --> 08:33.827
He wasn't like,

08:33.807 --> 08:42.220
You would think that it was, I guess a lot of people think that the Corps was bad.

08:42.440 --> 08:43.962
It wasn't bad.

08:44.443 --> 08:48.769
Discipline was there but it was like being in the Army or whatever, you know what I mean?

08:48.789 --> 08:54.598
But there was no situation where they were going to physically abuse you in that sense.

08:56.521 --> 08:59.325
There were some that maybe they wanted to.

08:59.305 --> 09:03.973
And I guess if they had the opportunity, they would do it.

09:04.554 --> 09:20.301
But then I think the majority of them felt that we were there for an education and they were going to do whatever they had to do to discipline you and make your life as hard as possible as a freshman, but only in the sense of

09:20.281 --> 09:24.797
of discipline, not necessarily the physical hazing or those kinds of things.

09:24.817 --> 09:26.523
We used to do push-ups and those kinds of things.

09:26.663 --> 09:27.868
That was natural, you know.

09:27.948 --> 09:31.962
I'll tell you a story here pretty soon of one of the things that did happen.

09:32.178 --> 09:35.061
Our outfit was kind of a renegade outfit.

09:36.242 --> 09:39.206
Our juniors were kind of like partiers, you know.

09:39.866 --> 09:46.614
They believed in wine and women and song, you know.

09:46.914 --> 09:48.276
They always wanted to party.

09:48.976 --> 09:51.259
And so I guess the sophomores had to put up with it.

09:51.659 --> 09:54.963
And so as freshmen we had to follow, you know.

09:55.063 --> 09:59.468
But we had, they were like

10:00.106 --> 10:10.677
if we did something that upset another outfit, or if we did something that maybe the Trigon would get upset about, then they always called that good bull.

10:12.519 --> 10:23.391
We stole one of the bass drums from the Aggie band, and our logo was a pink elephant footprint.

10:23.411 --> 10:27.615
So we would have a stencil, so we stole the drum, painted the

10:28.135 --> 10:38.269
or sprayed the elephant, the stencil, and then we rolled the drum back in and it had pink elephant footprints on the bass drum.

10:38.810 --> 10:53.670
Of course, they came after us pretty solid and so we would do things like go around the campus at night and put elephant footprints around the campus and mainly in areas where

10:53.870 --> 10:55.753
the Army units were.

10:55.773 --> 11:03.884
And also, you know, the Army was always after us in the Air Force, so we would always go out there and do it.

11:04.665 --> 11:11.214
Put it on the sidewalks or by their dorms, you know.

11:11.515 --> 11:13.558
I guess it's graffiti, legalized graffiti.

11:14.699 --> 11:22.290
And when we, there was a captain who was a Korean War veteran.

11:22.844 --> 11:23.946
And I'm trying to remember his name.

11:25.869 --> 11:32.300
And he came over to our dorm one day and told us that enough was enough.

11:32.881 --> 11:38.170
And if he even, he said, the last thing you guys did is you

11:38.420 --> 11:43.167
you went up to the tower, water tower, and put a pink elephant footprint up there.

11:43.968 --> 11:52.139
So, I'm going to tell you right now, if you even start to do it again, I will make sure that you all are campus for the rest of the semester.

11:52.440 --> 11:56.125
This was a captain from the Trigon Army.

11:57.226 --> 11:59.770
And so,

12:00.509 --> 12:01.753
It was a challenge, I think.

12:02.516 --> 12:05.928
We felt, well, he's not gonna tell us what to do, you know.

12:06.891 --> 12:09.982
So he had his office there.

12:10.945 --> 12:13.253
We were in dorm.

12:14.752 --> 12:15.413
see, what was it?

12:15.894 --> 12:16.656
Four, I think.

12:18.058 --> 12:18.880
See, no one thing.

12:18.900 --> 12:19.982
Five, dorm five.

12:20.844 --> 12:27.176
And so he was in, his office was in dorm three, in the quad.

12:27.196 --> 12:32.466
So that night we went, got the stencil, and where it had his, God, what is the captain's name?

12:33.228 --> 12:33.909
Real sharp guy.

12:33.929 --> 12:34.851
I mean, he was a paratrooper.

12:34.871 --> 12:36.895
I mean, this guy was

12:36.875 --> 12:44.527
And so we went out there and we stenciled his door with the pink elephant footprint.

12:45.788 --> 12:58.748
So he comes over the next day and he campuses all the freshmen in the outfit and chews on the juniors and the seniors for letting us do it and you should know better and gives them a

12:58.728 --> 13:07.658
gives them a going over, gets a hold of us, we're up against the wall, and he says, y'all are campus for the rest of the semester or until I let you out.

13:08.540 --> 13:14.767
I expect every Saturday after drill in the evenings, I expect to see y'all waxing those floors.

13:15.227 --> 13:18.351
So we'd have to wax all the hallways, all the way up and down.

13:18.371 --> 13:21.134
We had two floors, so we'd have to wax all the halls.

13:21.555 --> 13:22.616
And those floors looked beautiful.

13:23.377 --> 13:25.159
And he would come in, he would check.

13:27.021 --> 13:28.583
But the upperclassmen, you know,

13:28.917 --> 13:32.003
They would feel, okay, we know he can't be checking all the time.

13:32.544 --> 13:34.689
So we kind of figured out about what time he'd be there.

13:34.729 --> 13:40.962
So we'd get out there and we'd be working on the floors and he'd come by, we'd hit the wall and he'd say, yeah, you're all doing a good job.

13:41.002 --> 13:45.230
And then he'd leave and then they'd say, okay, go on.

13:45.671 --> 13:48.597
So it wasn't as bad as it sounded.

13:48.577 --> 13:56.463
That was one of the things that did happen to us and we were campus for, I think he only campuses for like a month and then he let us loose.

13:57.447 --> 14:01.219
The drill team, you practiced five days a week.

14:01.790 --> 14:06.137
And then where were some of your first performances?

14:06.197 --> 14:13.327
First performance was here on the campus at one of the football games.

14:13.347 --> 14:14.529
That was our first performance.

14:15.711 --> 14:23.663
And pretty much like how they used to follow in the fact that they would come in and drill with

14:23.643 --> 14:26.166
They used to let them do a performance.

14:26.467 --> 14:31.212
One time, I don't know when they stopped that, but we used to do the first performance there.

14:31.673 --> 14:49.195
And then when we had parades or ceremonies at the drill field, we would march with our outfit and they'd say, okay, the fish drill team will perform at a certain hour and we would come back and perform.

14:49.175 --> 14:56.164
We went, we didn't go to the competitions like they did up until the time that they dissolved the fish drill team.

14:56.905 --> 15:07.919
We would only have like, let's see, we went to Laredo for Washington birthday celebration, which was a fiasco, as I remember.

15:08.280 --> 15:13.326
We had real bad weather and they turned us loose.

15:13.306 --> 15:27.746
half of the guys went across the river and, I mean, they got real soused and, I mean, so we weren't going to compete and then the next morning we competed and so, I mean, half of them had horrible hangovers, to include myself.

15:27.806 --> 15:29.328
I shouldn't say it, I wasn't one of them.

15:29.348 --> 15:31.591
So, but we had a good time.

15:32.032 --> 15:39.482
And so, it was Laredo, the splash days in Galveston,

15:39.462 --> 15:44.427
the parade in San Antonio, the San Antonio Fiesta Week.

15:44.547 --> 15:47.230
Fiesta, uh-huh.

15:47.250 --> 15:47.751
And.

15:47.771 --> 15:50.233
Now at core trips, you all didn't perform?

15:50.594 --> 15:50.694
One.

15:50.934 --> 15:51.454
Oh, did you?

15:51.474 --> 15:52.716
On one, on the last one.

15:53.136 --> 15:53.216
Oh.

15:53.236 --> 15:53.997
We'd go as a unit.

15:54.758 --> 15:57.501
On the last, on the last, matter of fact I still have the picture of it.

15:58.101 --> 16:05.729
When I was a freshman we went to, we performed as a unit and marched as a unit as part of the core in Fort Worth.

16:06.010 --> 16:06.810
That was, that's where it was.

16:06.830 --> 16:08.372
It was in Dallas and Fort Worth.

16:08.352 --> 16:20.525
And yeah, the last court trip, we have two court trips a year, which either would be Dallas, Fort Worth, it would be Dallas, Houston, or Fort Worth, or Austin.

16:20.585 --> 16:24.850
So wherever the last one was, the fish drill team would go as a unit.

16:24.890 --> 16:27.613
So I'm pretty sure it was a Dallas court trip.

16:27.633 --> 16:29.215
So yeah, we marched as a unit.

16:29.936 --> 16:36.503
We would do a lot of ceremonial stuff, like honor guards,

16:37.850 --> 16:52.245
And so like we used to have the Trigon, they had more military activities, more military type dances and that kind of activity.

16:52.485 --> 16:54.027
And so we would honor guard a lot of them.

16:54.047 --> 17:02.355
They would bring the fish drill team, we would honor guard when all the bulls would come through and present arms and that kind of stuff.

17:02.335 --> 17:12.510
Did any national or world-famous politician or campus visitor come during that year and y'all were the honor guard?

17:13.071 --> 17:16.256
No, I can't recall during my freshman year, no, no.

17:16.376 --> 17:18.299
I can't recall that that happened, no.

17:18.319 --> 17:21.523
And there wasn't a gubernatorial inauguration that year?

17:21.623 --> 17:23.186
No, no.

17:23.206 --> 17:23.787
I don't think so.

17:23.807 --> 17:31.498
What was the, as far as you can recall, what was the highlight event for the fish drill team that year?

17:33.267 --> 17:34.930
What do you remember most proudly?

17:36.312 --> 17:54.702
I think the, just being the unit that it was throughout the whole year, that that was something that I think every one of us felt good about or felt great because, I mean, we were kind of

17:54.682 --> 18:03.003
an elite group of freshmen that were selected to be in this unit.

18:03.946 --> 18:08.016
And I think the fish drill team was not

18:08.519 --> 18:11.963
was not as much a ceremonial unit as a drill unit.

18:12.103 --> 18:14.706
Like the Solar Ross volunteers are more ceremonial to me.

18:15.607 --> 18:24.358
And I think we drilled a lot harder than like the Ross volunteers at that time.

18:24.378 --> 18:27.842
I don't know how the changes have taken place.

18:27.982 --> 18:34.510
And I guess the highlight of our, would have been the

18:34.912 --> 18:37.578
the trip to Laredo, the Washington birthdays.

18:37.598 --> 18:42.568
Because I think that was like the first trip that we made out, made away from the campus.

18:43.610 --> 18:46.155
And of course the requirement was the same.

18:46.175 --> 18:48.921
We had to be back by call to quarters at 8.30.

18:49.070 --> 18:56.480
And so they let us out like on a Friday and we all had to find our own way to get to Laredo.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.222
It wasn't like they bused us there.

18:58.242 --> 19:03.449
We all had to find our own transportation and we had to find a place to stay.

19:03.489 --> 19:06.974
Of course they made arrangements that we could stay at the barracks.

19:07.134 --> 19:13.963
At that time they had Laredo Air Force Base so we could all, any of us that wanted to stay on the base, we could stay at the base, which the majority of us did.

19:14.652 --> 19:24.027
And the majority of the Washington birthday celebrations took place on the military installation there because they didn't have a civic center there at that time.

19:24.047 --> 19:25.409
It wasn't that big.

19:25.429 --> 19:30.096
But anyway, that was a highlight.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.320
We won first place in that competition.

19:33.221 --> 19:35.885
And I think that's the first competition we were in.

19:35.906 --> 19:38.770
So I would say that would have to be the highlight.

19:39.155 --> 19:43.820
I think the last drill together was very important to us.

19:44.141 --> 19:44.941
Where was that?

19:44.962 --> 19:45.843
On the drill field here.

19:46.103 --> 19:47.464
Was that part of the final review?

19:47.484 --> 19:48.285
The final review, right.

19:48.626 --> 19:51.989
And no, it wasn't final review, it was spring military day.

19:53.051 --> 19:58.757
And that was the last time that we'd well-known McElvis.

19:59.077 --> 20:03.222
But that in particular was I think a big highlight to us, was almost the completion.

20:03.691 --> 20:06.118
And then, you're right, there was final review.

20:06.178 --> 20:10.932
We did perform one time in final review because that's when they gave us our awards.

20:11.053 --> 20:13.360
No, I'm going back, I'm going to make some mistakes here.

20:14.282 --> 20:17.953
That spring military day, then that Sunday after we drilled

20:18.980 --> 20:26.800
And they gave us our medals, our fish drill team medals, etc., etc., you know.

20:27.221 --> 20:29.747
They didn't have them like they do today, like they wear all their medals here.

20:30.168 --> 20:34.018
They'd give us a little medal like this, you know, and you'd keep it in a case.

20:33.998 --> 20:37.564
And the only thing you could wear was the ribbon.

20:38.325 --> 20:39.307
That's the only thing you could wear.

20:40.128 --> 20:41.390
And it was the barber pole.

20:41.430 --> 20:42.632
They used to call it the barber pole.

20:42.652 --> 20:45.056
I don't know if you're familiar with that or not.

20:45.076 --> 20:48.181
It was a maroon and white stripe, candy, like a candy stripe.

20:48.562 --> 20:49.764
We used to call it the barber pole.

20:49.804 --> 20:53.570
So you had a barber pole, you were supposed to be hot stuff, you know.

20:54.311 --> 20:57.677
So when we were

20:59.513 --> 21:13.408
In Laredo, I might mention this to you, Fish Alvarado, Richard Alvarado, Fish Alvarado and myself were together and we got detached from the fish drill team.

21:14.709 --> 21:18.413
We had the unit left.

21:19.575 --> 21:20.476
We didn't have a right back.

21:20.496 --> 21:21.457
We didn't get a right back.

21:22.358 --> 21:23.419
We didn't find a right back.

21:23.439 --> 21:29.065
Our right left, the person that had the car, so we didn't know how we were going to get back.

21:29.382 --> 21:35.640
So my uncle and my mother and my father were in Laredo to celebrate Washington's birthday celebration.

21:35.721 --> 21:37.847
And so I had to get a hold of my dad.

21:37.967 --> 21:38.970
I knew where they were staying.

21:39.710 --> 21:41.273
and tell them, Dad, I got bad news.

21:41.874 --> 21:43.276
We don't have a ride home.

21:43.396 --> 21:48.705
So we waited for them, and then they went ahead and brought us back to San Antonio.

21:48.725 --> 21:50.068
Of course, remember, we had one car.

21:51.290 --> 22:00.385
So it was a fish I brought on myself, and we, my dad says, well, just take the car.

22:01.107 --> 22:05.597
and then I'll pick it up, or we'll pick it up, or we'll figure it out, you know.

22:06.499 --> 22:12.071
So between San Marcos and Bastrop, the car broke down.

22:12.091 --> 22:16.842
And this was like, we were late already, we knew we were going to be in trouble.

22:18.546 --> 22:20.550
This was like about 9.30 at night.

22:21.830 --> 22:24.634
So the car breaks down, and so there we are.

22:25.275 --> 22:25.976
God, what were going to do?

22:26.016 --> 22:30.301
So no ways to communicate, so I said, well, let's start hitchhiking.

22:30.522 --> 22:38.212
So fortunately, there was two gentlemen that came by, and that was luck.

22:38.813 --> 22:41.276
They were going to go through A&M.

22:41.296 --> 22:42.598
They were on their way to Huntsville.

22:43.999 --> 22:48.225
And so they picked us up.

22:48.745 --> 22:51.310
And they brought us all the way, they took us right up to the door.

22:51.931 --> 22:56.480
And they stopped in Bastrop, so I called my dad and told my dad.

22:56.500 --> 23:04.375
Dad in the car broke down, so it's between about 30 miles here, whatever it was, from Bastrop.

23:04.355 --> 23:05.697
So he said, okay.

23:05.877 --> 23:06.619
He said, don't worry about it.

23:06.799 --> 23:13.009
I said, and he says, I told him, call my first sergeant and call Fish El Rado's first sergeant and tell him what happened.

23:13.910 --> 23:18.157
So ease the pain when we get there.

23:18.177 --> 23:25.148
So I figured, well, we probably did not arrive on the campus until about

23:27.119 --> 23:34.190
12.30 or 1 o'clock in the morning because we were out there for a while thumbing, you know, and they picked us up.

23:35.472 --> 23:44.807
And when I went into the dorm, I figured, oh, I'm going to try to sneak into my room and try not to make—I hope nobody—first sergeant was waiting for me.

23:45.310 --> 23:47.794
And I figured, well, this is it.

23:48.275 --> 23:52.682
I might as well just make my will and send it back.

23:53.945 --> 23:56.970
And so he yells at me and I, yes, sir.

23:57.050 --> 23:59.634
So I hit the wall and he says, you all right?

23:59.935 --> 24:00.536
I said, yes, sir.

24:01.557 --> 24:03.100
He said, we're starting to worry about you.

24:04.244 --> 24:06.710
And I said, I'm fine sir.

24:06.730 --> 24:09.136
And he says, get to bed.

24:09.878 --> 24:10.800
He says, it's late already.

24:11.181 --> 24:12.744
So never said a thing.

24:13.707 --> 24:15.591
It's amazing.

24:15.852 --> 24:17.616
You felt you'd had a good escape.

24:17.636 --> 24:21.325
Yeah.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.923
They were hard, but they had a heart, you know.

24:25.404 --> 24:26.445
It was like anybody else.

24:27.326 --> 24:36.377
And I know you asked me a question about if Hispanics had any, there was a difference of us.

24:38.600 --> 24:39.421
There was with some.

24:39.721 --> 24:42.665
I mean, you had to figure it out.

24:43.025 --> 24:49.253
In other words, if an upperclassman you knew had some resentments or whatever his

24:50.583 --> 24:57.733
part of the state they came from that maybe they didn't think that you were, should be there, okay.

24:58.894 --> 25:00.396
You had to figure those guys out.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.359
And then you just try to stay away from them.

25:02.639 --> 25:07.406
Because the majority of them would stay with you, you know, the upperclassmen.

25:07.946 --> 25:09.068
I'll give you one example.

25:09.208 --> 25:13.874
I had, there was two juniors from Luling, Texas.

25:15.857 --> 25:18.160
And one's name was Torkson.

25:19.388 --> 25:22.572
a very smart individual.

25:22.893 --> 25:24.435
And Wilson, he was also very smart.

25:24.475 --> 25:30.724
Wilson was a little on the redneck side, I can tell you that.

25:30.744 --> 25:35.090
And he would make my life miserable.

25:35.110 --> 25:37.533
I mean, he would make my life miserable.

25:38.815 --> 25:41.599
And during Bonfire,

25:42.305 --> 25:57.732
after we had been out on the bonfire area, because I don't know if you're familiar how bonfire worked back then, or maybe you are, that we would go, we would have like a crunch time, would go out there like for three days straight

25:57.712 --> 26:10.207
They'd get us up like at 5 o'clock in the morning, we'd go to the mess hall, eat breakfast, then some mode of transportation within ourselves, we'd get ourselves out to the cutting area, we'd be there all day, send lunches out, and you always stayed together as an outfit.

26:10.227 --> 26:15.093
Upperclassmen's responsibility to take care of the underclassmen.

26:15.113 --> 26:19.618
There was no hanky-panky, no drinking, no, I mean it was all business.

26:19.733 --> 26:30.668
We'd come back in the evening, they'd have a good meal for us in Duncan or Cebiza, wherever you would eat, but you would figure, you would say, have a good meal at Duncan or Cebiza.

26:31.329 --> 26:32.170
It wasn't that bad.

26:32.210 --> 26:38.839
So that one, when I was a freshman, we were at Bonfire, it was like the

26:38.819 --> 26:39.580
the second day.

26:40.121 --> 26:43.466
This guy's just pounding and pounding me after we come back, you know.

26:43.846 --> 26:45.128
They both sat at the same table.

26:46.310 --> 26:53.500
And Dorkson finally told Wilson, look, why the hell are you picking on him so damn much?

26:53.540 --> 26:55.342
Or why the hell do you have to haze him?

26:55.362 --> 26:58.026
He said, you know, we've been out here at the damn bonfire

26:58.765 --> 27:01.568
working our, at the cutting area, working our butts off.

27:01.588 --> 27:06.914
And here you are just like, you just can't get enough, you know?

27:07.195 --> 27:09.537
And he says, well, you don't know about this guy.

27:09.557 --> 27:13.422
And he says, well, I'll tell you what I know about Fish Garcia.

27:13.462 --> 27:18.507
I think he's one of the, one of the best fish that we have.

27:18.928 --> 27:21.150
And he's one of the sharpest fish we have.

27:22.292 --> 27:24.114
And I think you need to stay off his butt.

27:24.434 --> 27:27.017
And he says, if you don't, he says,

27:27.217 --> 27:31.624
I'm going to take care of you myself.

27:32.752 --> 27:36.836
It was weird that that upperclassman just came up and just stood up, you know.

27:37.557 --> 27:41.141
And they were big buddies, and both from the same town.

27:41.962 --> 27:46.686
So he says, I think that you've gone far enough, and I hope that you take my advice.

27:47.467 --> 27:51.872
This guy wound up being the CEO of one of the outfits next year, and Dawson did.

27:52.112 --> 27:55.456
And Wilson wound up quitting the Corps and became a non-reg.

27:56.256 --> 28:01.662
I don't know, like I said, I don't know what the situation was, but you just had to kind of like

28:02.148 --> 28:08.758
If you felt that something rubbed them wrong, then you would try to work around it.

28:09.899 --> 28:20.815
I think what I felt was one of the important things for me was that I'm going to show them that I'm as good or better than anybody else here, and I can do that, and I'm going to work hard to do that.

28:21.352 --> 28:23.977
And I think that would work everything out.

28:24.177 --> 28:28.466
And then they would kind of like, okay, this guy's okay.

28:30.550 --> 28:35.980
It's a shame that it was that way, but the instances were not that great.

28:36.501 --> 28:40.288
And I'm assuming that when the San Antonio Hometown Club met,

28:41.315 --> 28:45.461
there were some Hispanic and some Anglo guys in the same room.

28:45.481 --> 28:46.802
That y'all were all mixed up, weren't you?

28:46.822 --> 28:47.804
Yes, yes.

28:47.844 --> 28:50.587
There weren't very many Hispanics, but there were some.

28:51.208 --> 28:55.614
I mean, the numbers were not big numbers, but we all got along.

28:56.015 --> 29:05.888
I mean, and all the San Antonio hometown club from, you know, your freshman to your senior level, they were very close.

29:06.526 --> 29:11.872
They would drop handles with you right away and some of those guys were real tough guys, you know.

29:11.892 --> 29:16.657
I mean they were considered like hard-nosed, but they treated us right.

29:16.717 --> 29:18.479
Did you have a nickname?

29:19.460 --> 29:21.622
Well actually my name when I came up here was Gregory.

29:22.323 --> 29:22.663
Gregory.

29:22.683 --> 29:23.404
And they shortened it.

29:23.644 --> 29:25.887
Everybody just cut it to Greg.

29:26.007 --> 29:26.968
So that's how it stuck.

29:26.988 --> 29:29.611
That's why I go by Greg now, because it was Gregory.

29:29.711 --> 29:33.495
And you'll see it in Gregory A. Garcia.

29:33.695 --> 29:36.399
My short name was Greg.

29:36.620 --> 29:39.484
That's how they finally tagged that on me.

29:40.185 --> 29:57.272
And yeah there was always the joking kind of stuff, like with the, my roommate was, one of my roommates, one of my friends, really wasn't my roommate, he was Italian and so we used to kid each other a little bit, you know, like as always.

29:57.674 --> 30:03.442
he'd call me a hot tamale, I'd call him a wop, you know, those kind of things.

30:03.962 --> 30:05.264
But I mean it was all in good nature.

30:05.284 --> 30:09.129
It wasn't like we were, had anything against each other, just the way it was, you know.

30:09.750 --> 30:15.218
Like any young man with a group of guys, you know, you do those kind of things.

30:15.278 --> 30:22.888
But really, you know, I think that everybody was

30:24.387 --> 30:32.817
Once you established yourself and they knew what you were doing, and you proved yourself, then everything was on, on a pretty much equal, equal plane.

30:33.237 --> 30:36.160
When did you begin to feel that you had accomplished that?

30:36.821 --> 30:39.484
Was it by the end of the first semester?

30:40.285 --> 30:40.465
Yes.

30:41.126 --> 30:42.407
You began to feel it?

30:42.427 --> 30:43.709
Yes, definitely.

30:44.630 --> 30:46.412
Definitely.

30:47.793 --> 30:52.760
Spring, see, the end of the first semester, I figured I was pretty much there.

30:53.481 --> 30:58.188
Right at the start of the second semester, we were getting ready to have some, I don't know what the deal was.

30:58.208 --> 31:00.872
We had something that we had to do as a corps.

31:02.494 --> 31:06.740
And so the fish drill team was going as their unit, so I fall out with my outfit.

31:06.760 --> 31:08.122
Of course, I had to fall out with my outfit first.

31:08.783 --> 31:12.248
I was in the hallway, and I was in the uniform that the...
