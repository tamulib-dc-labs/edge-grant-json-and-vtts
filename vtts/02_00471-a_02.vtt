WEBVTT

00:01.263 --> 00:03.246
It is August 1st. This is the third interview with 
General Hanover.

00:11.997 --> 00:21.009
This

00:11.997 --> 00:21.009
is the last or the third and probably last 
interview with General Hanover. Today is August

00:21.570 --> 00:24.273
1st, 1980. Today let's talk about the military and 
leadership and the changes that have taken place

00:27.385 --> 00:32.812
at Texas A&M. All right. How does one get ahead in 
the military? Is it different from professional

00:38.919 --> 00:43.505
life in business or in academics? Are there 
similarities? Terry, I really don't think there

00:47.449 --> 00:49.832
are any differences. Basically, leadership is 
leadership wherever you are, in my opinion. And I

00:56.832 --> 01:21.748
think they all come about by a person striving to 
excel and making those that you're leading feel

00:56.832 --> 01:21.748
like they can be led properly and setting an 
example of the way you expect people to work or to

00:56.832 --> 01:21.748
follow, whichever it may be, whether it's 
military, civilian, or whatever. OK. Now, when

01:21.769 --> 01:26.215
you think back on your military career and 
advancement Did you leave advancement to all,

01:27.730 --> 01:38.663
let's say, fate, the decisions of others, or did 
you think that your advancement was because of

01:27.730 --> 01:38.663
your actions? Well, it's bound to be a little of 
both. I think the basic part of it is a person

01:44.690 --> 01:55.223
himself as to how he progresses, how his... 
feelings toward whether he wants to advance,

01:55.540 --> 02:01.627
there are some people who do not want to advance. 
There are some people who do not want to be leaders.

02:05.792 --> 02:06.713
They want to be led. And so it's a great percent of 
what a person puts himself in as to his own

02:06.773 --> 02:23.472
feelings, his own actions, but there is always 
that part of it that the positions become

02:24.970 --> 02:42.492
available because many times two people could be 
almost exact leader, have leadership qualities,

02:24.970 --> 02:42.492
and one may have opportunities where the other 
does never get them. So the majority of it, I would

02:42.512 --> 02:54.707
say, is a person himself, his actions, his 
reactions, but there must be openings for

02:42.512 --> 02:54.707
climbing up the ladder. Yeah, yeah. Very few men 
obtain the success that you've had. Very few

02:59.837 --> 03:03.921
become generals or become directors in charge of a 
highway district. Do you feel that during your

03:05.443 --> 03:09.667
career you would consider yourself ambitious? 
Yes, I was ambitious. I wanted to, I wanted to move

03:16.154 --> 03:19.097
up. I wanted to Get in a position of 
responsibility. I like responsibility. I like to

03:27.988 --> 03:30.270
lead. Of course, I think a good leader at some point 
likes to be led. You must be led early in the game. Of

03:39.220 --> 03:44.846
course, a person never gets to the place where he's 
not led by someone. Unless it's like Truman said,

03:45.767 --> 03:49.011
the buck stops here. There's one or two places in 
the world that the buck stops. But even in my two

03:54.558 --> 04:06.170
positions of leadership, there were those above 
me who, you must say, were leading me or giving me

03:54.558 --> 04:06.170
the opportunity to follow. And even though the 
president, of course, there, at least in a

04:06.190 --> 04:12.536
democracy, seemed to be led quite a bit by popular 
opinion. Theoretically. Theoretically. I think

04:14.338 --> 04:16.561
that was a clever saying. And to a degree, it's 
correct. Now, of course, retirement is a

04:19.636 --> 04:25.081
substantial change in an individual's life. Why 
did you retire from the military? Well, I had

04:29.426 --> 04:48.445
forced military retirement because under the 
rules and regulations, certain ranks have

04:29.426 --> 04:48.445
certain areas

04:29.426 --> 04:48.445
you can move up through, but there are points to 
where At a certain time, if you have not moved

04:49.218 --> 04:58.089
further or if you do not move out of a position, then 
you will have mandatory retirement. Now, there

04:59.311 --> 05:03.936
are not too many brigadier generals. There are 
less major generals. So there are some people who

05:07.421 --> 05:18.094
got to be major generals who were in a little more 
favorable position than I. I never had that

05:07.421 --> 05:18.094
opportunity. I think I would have liked to have had 
it if I had that opportunity, but I have no regrets

05:18.867 --> 05:26.418
as to the position that I got to. I don't feel like 
that, you know, the gate was shut to me and that I

05:26.819 --> 05:43.543
have a resentment that I didn't get to be a major 
general because that would have taken more time on

05:26.819 --> 05:43.543
my part, more effort, and I thought I was very 
successful as I was and I felt a great sense of

05:26.819 --> 05:43.543
accomplishment. So it was really mandatory as far 
as the Was there a rule, were you alluding to the day

05:49.259 --> 06:04.497
before yesterday, a rule that after you were in a 
grade for five years, then it was mandatory

05:49.259 --> 06:04.497
retirement? In the grade of Brigadier General, at 
the time that I reached that position, you could

06:04.517 --> 06:16.431
either stay five years in grade are 30 years of 
service, whichever came later. And the five years

06:21.510 --> 06:28.138
in grade came later for me because I had 31 and a half 
years of total service. So there is a stopping

06:29.640 --> 06:31.722
point. You're not allowed to just stay and stay 
when you reach either so much in grade or so many

06:32.383 --> 06:39.952
years in service. Now, do you remember your 
thoughts on the day that you retired? Can you tell

06:44.678 --> 06:45.959
me about that? Very well. I had no animosity at all 
to the service for putting me out. I was highly

06:56.510 --> 07:01.496
pleased that I had accomplished the thing that I 
had. I had been working very hard over the last two

07:01.516 --> 07:07.783
to three years that I was in command. I spent a great 
deal of weekends, a great deal of nights, And this

07:14.123 --> 07:19.992
had deprived me of a lot of time with my family. It 
was part of the job. And taking the job, I did that.

07:26.984 --> 07:34.736
But I think I felt that I had reached a point that I 
could take a deep breath and say, you know, I'm

07:26.984 --> 07:34.736
going to have some time of my own. So I really felt 
like I had sort of reached

07:43.165 --> 08:11.890
pinnacle that I was looking for I had gotten to the 
top of the mountain I could see on the other side and

07:43.165 --> 08:11.890
I was ready to go back down if that makes any sense 
and it's a great deal of sense

07:43.165 --> 08:11.890
and another thing that gave me satisfaction I knew 
who was going to take my place or at least I was

07:43.165 --> 08:11.890
pretty certain and I felt like that The command 
structure was in good hands, and it would, as I told

08:12.663 --> 08:34.911
someone, each time you get a new leader, you get new 
ideas, you get new motives, you get new thoughts,

08:12.663 --> 08:34.911
and I can't help but to believe that a change of 
command many times enhances an organization.

08:35.912 --> 08:38.916
I didn't feel like I had all the answers, in other 
words. A new man had new answers, A lot of times a new

08:42.245 --> 08:47.512
room is sweet to clean,

08:42.245 --> 08:47.512
you know. Plus you had your civilian crew to look 
forward to. That's correct. And how many more

08:50.997 --> 08:56.004
years did you have to look forward in the highway 
department? Well, actually, I had, at that time, I

08:56.024 --> 09:10.463
had about, let's see,

08:56.024 --> 09:10.463
well, I must have had about four or five more prior 
to mandatory retirement. But I was not

09:14.957 --> 09:19.203
anticipating going to mandatory retirement. At 
that time, you had to retire at the highway

09:19.223 --> 09:22.989
department at 65. And I guess in 71, I was, well, I 
guess I was 57. So I'd have had eight years that I

09:31.240 --> 09:34.465
could have worked. But I didn't plan to work all 
that length of time. How long did you want to work? I

09:43.297 --> 09:49.045
had the plan to work till about 60, which would have 
been five years ahead of mandatory. And the reason

09:49.145 --> 09:54.092
for that was, well, really two things. One, I 
wanted to retire early as soon as I felt like I

09:54.292 --> 09:59.219
financially could do so. And as you know, you draw a 
reservist or a reserve army people draw their

10:00.561 --> 10:09.373
retirement at 60. And I had sort of planned that 
that would be a point that I could afford to retire.

10:14.837 --> 10:20.604
That plus my highway pay would enable me to retire 
and live comfortably. And so you did retire at age

10:22.165 --> 10:24.007
60? Well, just prior to. In fact, I was going to 
retire at 60, but the retirement of the highway

10:26.070 --> 10:39.124
department comes under the state legislature, 
and they made a few last-minute changes which made

10:26.070 --> 10:39.124
it economically feasible or economically 
advantageous to me to retire in August prior to the

10:39.931 --> 10:52.565
following February, which I planned to retire. So 
I retired, well, August ahead of my 60th birthday

10:52.585 --> 10:59.953
in February. Are you happy that you retired? 
Absolutely. I have never regretted retirement,

11:05.459 --> 11:08.622
not one minute. In fact, my first day of retirement 
was three years ago today. I retired on July 31st.

11:18.331 --> 11:25.420
So three years ago today, I was a retired person 
from the military and the highway department. And

11:25.440 --> 11:29.665
it was a great day, and I've had three years of great 
time since. Now, that would not be possible for a

11:32.109 --> 11:38.136
person like me unless you have outside injuries. 
Absolutely. And I had many outside interests and I

11:39.764 --> 11:45.531
was looking forward to getting into those. I had 
not had time to do that during the years that I was

11:46.092 --> 11:55.403
active in the Reserve and Highway Department and I 
have just really had a ball. Been delightful.

11:58.947 --> 12:00.149
Let's talk about leadership. You started to 
define leadership just a few minutes ago. Could

12:06.156 --> 12:07.498
you define it for me? Well, other than those things 
that I said, the ability to lead, the ability to

12:10.077 --> 12:37.958
understand being led, the ability to decide 
courses of action that are both advantageous for

12:10.077 --> 12:37.958
you and your organization and those that are being 
led, your ability to see, I think, an end through

12:38.849 --> 13:08.788
the possible problems that may arise and I think 
also the ability to to analyze problems as they do

12:38.849 --> 13:08.788
crop up and to be able to accomplish a mission set 
out with with the and I always think with the good

12:38.849 --> 13:08.788
feeling of those that are being led there are 
leaders in my opinion, who lead by sheer force and

13:09.427 --> 13:22.779
by sheer determination, regardless of how it 
affects those who are led. And there are

13:24.320 --> 13:26.121
successful people at that. And I really think one 
of my best definitions of one of those was Patton.

13:34.629 --> 13:38.472
Patton, without question, was a leader. an 
absolute leader, but he led behind the feeling of

13:39.211 --> 13:47.181
those that were being led. And that is not my 
philosophy. And I don't mean by that that you can

13:52.448 --> 13:56.994
lead and keep your lead happy all the time. But I 
think that the feelings, I think the concern and

13:58.055 --> 14:09.049
welfare of those that are being led is part of the 
marks of a leader. You can't argue with success,

14:11.273 --> 14:22.231
but I am a different type leader than Patton was. Of 
course, he was in a much, much more important

14:22.251 --> 14:33.990
position than I, but my philosophies are 
different than his. Now, sometimes when you talk

14:34.190 --> 14:45.787
about, or I've heard in the past when people talk 
about, they talk about military leaders, and then

14:34.190 --> 14:45.787
they talk about political leaders, and they talk 
about other types of civilian leaders. Do you

14:46.348 --> 15:02.652
think there is a difference between the military 
type leader, maybe you were alluding to it a minute

14:46.348 --> 15:02.652
ago, and when you talked about Patton, Patton's 
sort of a kick-em-in-the-you-know-where, an

14:46.348 --> 15:02.652
over-the-hill-boys type leader, and sometimes 
civilians get the idea that that's what military

14:46.348 --> 15:02.652
leadership is. What do you think about that? No, I 
think a lot of qualities of leadership depend on

15:05.476 --> 15:11.443
the individual. I think my qualities of 
leadership and yours could be entirely

15:12.384 --> 15:19.512
different, and they could both be highly 
successful.

15:22.495 --> 15:35.230
And here again, comparing, I could not attempt to 
lead like Patton did, and he probably couldn't

15:22.495 --> 15:35.230
have been successful as I led.

15:35.648 --> 15:37.531
He's just got a different philosophy. But each 
end, of course, a lot of qualities of leadership

15:38.592 --> 15:45.161
everybody's got. I think there's a lot of it that is 
common to everybody. But the specifics of

15:50.489 --> 16:04.508
leadership depend a great deal on the individual 
and his ability to interpret and to impart to the

15:50.489 --> 16:04.508
subordinates and react to the superiors are 
entirely different. What about personal values

16:09.439 --> 16:11.581
in leadership? I mean, do you think that an 
individual has to have certain values? I sure do.

16:18.788 --> 16:19.869
Like, for example? Well, I think you've got to be 
honest. I think you've got to be straightforward.

16:26.275 --> 16:27.756
I think you've got to be open. I think you've got to 
have an appreciation of those that are being led

16:34.559 --> 17:03.047
there are a lot of values and I guess here again 
those could differ with the leader but in my

16:34.559 --> 17:03.047
opinion those four or five are very important and 
I'm sure there are a great many others do you feel

16:34.559 --> 17:03.047
that you have those values well I was aware of them 
all the time and and attempted that it was my intent

16:34.559 --> 17:03.047
to have those things and I worked at it I If I didn't 
fulfill those, it was accidentally not

17:03.989 --> 17:12.839
intentional because I think they're very 
important.

17:16.142 --> 17:24.571
I think one that I have always felt like was real 
important was recognition of jobs well done.

17:24.652 --> 17:30.638
After it is done, I think you've got to begin with 
You've got to begin by telling people what you

17:30.871 --> 17:38.582
expect, being explicit and having two-way 
communication. But then after the job is done,

17:39.303 --> 17:44.511
whether it's done right or wrong, some type of 
recognition. Hopefully, a pat on the back. I think

17:48.357 --> 17:56.569
anybody who looks to somebody for leadership 
wants to know if they don't do it right. And I think

17:57.651 --> 18:00.034
that's important. I think there's a proper way to 
tell them it's right or it's wrong. Those are my

18:06.505 --> 18:09.948
thinking about that sort of thing. This is sort of a 
similar question.

18:17.095 --> 18:18.917
But nevertheless, I think it's important. You 
said that you had intent to become a good leader.

18:23.441 --> 18:29.447
Let's say you were talking to a group of corpsmen 
today over at A&M, and the topic was, how to become a

18:29.832 --> 18:31.675
leader. Are these some of the things that you'd 
say, and are there others? Yes.

18:39.086 --> 18:42.491
I think for a man to be a leader, he has to want to be a 
leader.

18:45.296 --> 18:58.135
People that, and I say people, because we're 
mainly talking about leading people, I think, but

18:45.296 --> 18:58.135
people that are led want to know that their leader 
does want to be a leader it's i i have been in

18:58.368 --> 19:27.902
situations where i was being led by people who 
either didn't have an interest in what they were

18:58.368 --> 19:27.902
doing or they really didn't care about being 
leaders and it's very evident to me yeah and i want

18:58.368 --> 19:27.902
to be led by someone who has my interest who has his 
interest who's got a goal and who wants to be a

19:28.523 --> 19:41.463
leader, I look to people that are not interested in 
what they're doing and are not really concerned

19:28.523 --> 19:41.463
about success. And really, it's not going to 
succeed a great much of the time. And I think a good

19:47.732 --> 19:50.437
leader has to be an optimist. That's another one. I 
think a good leader has got to be an optimist.

19:57.110 --> 20:00.974
Because I'd rather be an optimist and be wrong than 
a pessimist and be right. So I think optimism plays

20:02.496 --> 20:05.139
a great part. That's another value, probably. 
That's right. What about tolerance? You've got to

20:11.306 --> 20:12.247
be tolerant. You've got to be tolerant. Because 
everybody's not going to do exactly like you want

20:16.532 --> 20:21.398
them to do. And if you can show people here again, 
I'm talking I'm speaking of my own thoughts. My

20:29.346 --> 20:29.847
own, yeah. Patton certainly probably wasn't 
tolerant. That's right.

20:35.455 --> 20:37.177
But it worked for him in some manner. It almost 
caused his downfall in others. But if you're

20:42.384 --> 20:49.294
tolerant with people, then they're not going to be 
afraid to act. If a person is afraid to make a

20:49.554 --> 20:52.598
mistake, then he's not going to do much because 
everybody feels that he has the possibility of

20:53.489 --> 21:02.698
making a mistake. And if he makes a mistake and he 
knows that he's going to just catch hell from every

21:03.439 --> 21:14.449
side, then he's reluctant to do a whole lot. And of 
course, those that worked for Patton for years, I

21:16.011 --> 21:22.737
guess, came to recognize that as part of working 
for him. But I'd say he did not have tolerance, and

21:26.632 --> 21:33.301
tolerance, in my opinion, is a quality of 
leadership. Nor did he have flexibility. That's

21:35.063 --> 21:35.944
right. And you think that in your idea of 
leadership, is flexibility important? It plays a

21:39.509 --> 21:40.290
part. It sure does.

21:44.336 --> 21:50.564
You're a rigid person, a person who says, my idea is 
the only one. You're you're just heading for some

21:53.024 --> 21:59.092
disaster, in my opinion.

21:59.112 --> 22:10.106
Another quality of leadership, I think, and I 
think I had this, or at least I attempted to, and

21:59.112 --> 22:10.106
that is to be receptive to the idea of others.

22:13.331 --> 22:17.116
There's no one person who's got all the answers. 
And I continually sought

22:23.078 --> 22:38.836
and was demanding that other people give me their 
ideas for whatever the problem was, whatever the

22:23.078 --> 22:38.836
decision I was making, I used my staff to a great 
degree, I think. I certainly intended to, and I

22:39.877 --> 22:46.464
believe I was successful in that. There are 
suggestions? Yes, yes. Input from... staff,

22:52.643 --> 22:56.188
assistants, subordinates. What about mustard 
men? I've gotten some some from them too you know

22:58.531 --> 23:11.930
that's uh gosh they've they've got more ideas than 
you ever saw some of them are far-fetched but pitch

22:58.531 --> 23:11.930
it out the window but evaluate it right if you don't 
need it. A man to me was not too low on the pole to have

23:13.172 --> 23:17.678
a good idea. I've had some Tremendous suggestions

23:19.981 --> 23:33.102
from, I'll use the word, raw recruits, you know, 
people who just moved in with the picture.

23:34.063 --> 23:38.851
I really never ridiculed any suggestions. I like 
to take them and spin them around and bring it out

23:39.712 --> 23:45.702
and see if it's any good. Another thing I think a 
leader has got to have and that is the ability to

23:48.365 --> 24:03.919
finally make up his mind and act and not to 
continually wonder if you made a good decision. A

24:05.480 --> 24:11.666
decision has to be made and acted upon and then that 
is down the river.

24:14.949 --> 24:18.372
Go to the next problem because there's not 
anything you can do about that one And here again,

24:19.533 --> 24:28.481
I've seen people who could make a decision, but 
then they'd just continue to worry about whether

24:19.533 --> 24:28.481
it was a good decision. And I think that's time and 
effort lost. You just mentioned your staff. Can

24:36.429 --> 24:43.175
you tell me about the quality of the staff that you 
were commanding?

24:46.038 --> 24:47.540
Well, I selected most of them. I ought to have 
thought they were pretty good. But you had a large

24:50.212 --> 24:53.615
pool of quality then to select from. That's right. 
I don't mean they all were top notch. Here again,

25:02.483 --> 25:06.947
everybody has their own limitations. But I have 
had both civilian and military some very fine

25:08.088 --> 25:16.655
assistance. And I've always be the first to say 
that those who were helping me had a great deal to do

25:19.270 --> 25:27.738
with the success that I had. I don't by any means 
feel that I attained the rank in the military or the

25:27.758 --> 25:38.708
position in the highway department by myself. I 
had a lot of help, and there were probably many

25:38.728 --> 25:47.036
others who were just as qualified as I, and I got 
some breaks. Maybe they didn't. But it wasn't done

25:48.734 --> 25:54.320
by myself, my whole life. As we've already 
established, your ideas of leadership are much

25:54.581 --> 26:01.468
different than General Patton's. I know that this 
is an impossible question to answer, really, but

26:01.488 --> 26:08.336
I'd just like your thoughts on this. Do you think 
that in the military, more people have the idea of

26:09.517 --> 26:18.387
leadership that you have or General Patton?

26:21.978 --> 26:23.900
Well, that is a hard question.

26:26.303 --> 26:42.483
I don't know of very many

26:26.303 --> 26:42.483
leaders who reached the level, say, that Patton 
did that had the leadership qualities that he had.

26:42.663 --> 26:46.528
I think he was sort of one out of many.

26:49.952 --> 26:51.073
I don't believe across the board that very many 
people could be as successful as Patton was with

26:51.661 --> 27:02.211
his qualities of leadership. I believe there have 
been more successful leaders with more of my style

27:03.512 --> 27:18.487
or the style that I like to feel I fall in than his 
style. I think he's I think he's on the extreme far

27:19.893 --> 27:28.265
side of the middle of the road type leaders, in my 
opinion. So if I had to make a guess, I'd say Moore

27:29.547 --> 27:35.275
followed my style and followed his style. Would 
you say that your style runs closer to someone,

27:35.296 --> 27:41.525
let's say, like General Eisenhower? Well, I don't 
know that I can put myself in his style, but he He was

27:47.669 --> 27:51.555
more of a soldier's leader than was Patton. And I 
liked to feel like I was a soldier's leader or a

27:52.937 --> 27:58.305
civilian leader, whatever. So my style was, I'd 
say, a whole lot more like him than it was like

27:59.727 --> 28:08.160
Patton. Another question. You were a leader in 
war? on a smaller scale during the Second World

28:14.315 --> 28:20.961
War, and you're also a leader on a larger scale 
during peacetime. Is it more difficult to be a

28:22.202 --> 28:28.148
leader during war or during peace in the military?

28:31.230 --> 28:35.774
Well, more difficult, I'm not sure I know what you 
mean. There are more difficulties arising in war,

28:35.875 --> 28:44.102
of course, but I really don't think that there's 
any difference and leadership no matter the

28:45.213 --> 28:48.597
situation. Now, there are hardships and there are 
turmoils and there are disasters that happen

28:50.039 --> 29:13.026
during wartime or emergency times that may take 
more far-reaching decisions or decisions that

28:50.039 --> 29:13.026
affect a lot more people. But I really don't 
believe that there's really any difference in

29:13.664 --> 29:21.235
good leadership, whatever the situation. What 
about the idea of cause? The men having a cause.

29:27.545 --> 29:33.474
World War II was a time when the country was united, 
perhaps like no time before in American history.

29:33.514 --> 29:34.716
We have a cause. Do you think that has any impact on 
helping a leader become a great leader, or helping

29:35.657 --> 29:42.287
an individual become a leader? Oh, it's bound to. 
If

29:46.239 --> 30:03.795
soldiers are motivated by common cause, so to 
speak, there's no question that it makes

29:46.239 --> 30:03.795
leadership easier. But still, the basics of 
leadership are there regardless. If people are

30:13.098 --> 30:31.041
unmotivated or if the morale is low from other 
standpoints, then it just adds some more

30:13.098 --> 30:31.041
responsibilities to leadership that I think a 
good leader has. And it just tries them out a little

30:32.282 --> 30:36.948
bit harder. But it's a good point. They were 
motivated. regardless of who the leader was. But

30:45.163 --> 30:55.940
really, war or otherwise, I don't really look at it 
as any more difficult one way or the other. I think

30:56.320 --> 31:04.333
responsibilities and problems of leadership are 
there, whatever the situation.

31:08.532 --> 31:33.524
Of course, leadership is an important question 
politically today, because it seems like ever

31:08.532 --> 31:33.524
since 1968,

31:08.532 --> 31:33.524
when President Johnson said he was no longer going 
to run for re-election, and then we had Watergate,

31:08.532 --> 31:33.524
it seems like we've had a leadership crisis, at 
least the journalists seem to say that we've had

31:08.532 --> 31:33.524
this leadership crisis in America. How could we 
resolve this?
