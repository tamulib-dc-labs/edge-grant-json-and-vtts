WEBVTT

00:03.659 --> 00:07.808
As I recall, you make my mind bounce back just a little.

00:08.268 --> 00:25.043
As I recall, one of the things that Dr. Williams said to the board in praise of Calhoun to be the new president was that if they were going to have a chancellor and a president, if we're going back to the system, that he and Calhoun worked well together.

00:25.833 --> 00:54.675
and that Calhoun worked well with the general campus leadership, that there would not then be a break in the continuity which he, Williams, hoped had been continued from Rudder to Williams and would now go on, and that he thought that Calhoun had to gather a good team out of which they might find some people with promise

00:54.976 --> 01:06.130
in the future years, but apparently the board had made up their mind that they were going to go in another direction.

01:08.532 --> 01:22.249
Were you, as you look back on it now, do you think of any particular changes in any major directions made by Jarvis from previous?

01:23.512 --> 01:26.376
No, I really don't.

01:26.576 --> 01:43.601
And one thing, Jervis really paid a lot of attention to outside matters, to public relations, to keeping connections with people that we ought to be connected with.

01:44.442 --> 01:48.388
And to a large extent, Howard and I ran things internally.

01:49.162 --> 01:50.985
And John Koldis, of course, for the students.

01:51.046 --> 01:59.000
But we'd always take our stuff in for his approval, but it was usually whatever we wanted to do.

01:59.021 --> 02:01.605
But he didn't make any sweeping changes.

02:01.706 --> 02:06.234
Describe those colleagues, Koldis and Vestal.

02:08.218 --> 02:11.524
Let me describe Vestal this way as saying,

02:11.639 --> 02:19.647
His attitude as a financial officer was, what can I do to help the functions of A&M, which are teaching and research?

02:20.168 --> 02:20.869
How can I help?

02:23.531 --> 02:31.720
Of course, it also, my view is biased, and he's a dear personal friend, so largely as a result of having worked together.

02:32.261 --> 02:39.368
Coldest also was a superb person with whom to cooperate, affable and pleasant

02:40.040 --> 02:42.766
with a photographic memory of people's names.

02:43.147 --> 02:43.808
Absolutely.

02:44.410 --> 02:45.712
Yeah, they were a joy to work with.

02:46.133 --> 02:55.213
Let's see, and whether their title was vice president or not, the vice presidents were you, Vestal,

02:56.543 --> 02:57.124
Colas.

02:58.306 --> 03:06.578
And then he appointed Jarvis's, oh yes, there was a sweeping change, and he appointed vice presidents for agriculture and for engineering.

03:06.878 --> 03:08.421
Sorry, I've forgotten that.

03:09.342 --> 03:18.115
And he appointed Perry as vice president for agriculture and Fred for engineering.

03:19.517 --> 03:23.563
And then they were

03:26.041 --> 03:38.516
vice presidents, and then because of his intense interest in foreign affairs, Terry Greathouse was appointed vice president for foreign programs.

03:39.617 --> 03:48.248
Then another thing, you remember when he split off, he took the Development Foundation and Galveston.

03:49.529 --> 03:55.997
And I think you got to thinking over, now wait a minute, the Development Foundation is to develop Texas A&M.

03:56.618 --> 04:05.170
And so Jarvis and I had been at a meeting of the coordinating board or something, and we were in Austin.

04:06.812 --> 04:14.502
And Jack came up to us after it was over and said, Jarvis, I'm sending the Development Foundation back to the university.

04:15.844 --> 04:18.688
And he said, but I do think that Bob Walker ought to be a vice president.

04:19.469 --> 04:23.014
And so that made the, what, in the sixth, the vice president.

04:23.517 --> 04:31.369
In regard to him, how did you find working with Bob Walker?

04:34.995 --> 04:36.357
Had very little contact with him.

04:37.800 --> 04:46.313
I've never thought that Bob and his folks were at all interruptive or contradictory.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.917
I've always thought of them as positive and very

04:49.522 --> 04:56.157
prone to work within the appropriate academic channels.

04:56.288 --> 05:00.253
I had very little to do with him in that sense.

05:01.054 --> 05:09.124
And one of the deans, when I was vice president, one of the deans said, I thought expressed pretty well, said, Dr. Walker seems to have his own agenda.

05:09.285 --> 05:12.909
So whatever I suggest doesn't make much difference.

05:14.772 --> 05:14.972
All right.

05:14.992 --> 05:18.917
So you served with Jarvis for four years.

05:19.257 --> 05:20.519
Yeah, three and a half.

05:20.539 --> 05:21.300
Let's see, what was it?

05:21.280 --> 05:22.882
Three and a half, yeah.

05:23.822 --> 05:24.243
Oh, wait a minute.

05:24.263 --> 05:25.084
Let me think a minute.

05:25.564 --> 05:26.625
It was 77.

05:27.706 --> 05:35.313
It was September 77 until July of 80 when he was, yes, okay, just under three years.

05:35.333 --> 05:42.500
During that, and I'm going to ask the negative, who were the key deans in that period?

05:47.065 --> 05:48.486
Dave Maxwell, of course.

05:49.833 --> 05:51.877
What made him so?

05:52.358 --> 06:12.837
Well, he'd been around several years, knew a lot of people, was level-headed and articulate, just an all-around asset.

06:14.048 --> 06:23.179
Of course, we had a new dean of engineering because Benson had moved up to the system.

06:24.320 --> 06:29.987
But no, he didn't move up to the system until Dr. Hubert took over.

06:30.007 --> 06:32.290
So he had moved up to the vice presidency.

06:35.234 --> 06:36.916
Harry, of course, was still in place.

06:37.016 --> 06:38.437
And agriculture was running well.

06:38.578 --> 06:42.182
No real difficulties there.

06:49.418 --> 06:53.664
Education was obviously doing well under Hubert.

06:54.185 --> 06:55.967
He and I had differences later, obviously.

06:57.829 --> 07:12.169
But, you know, those three, then when Bob Stone came in, he was absolutely stellar.

07:14.174 --> 07:16.377
Well, he came in within about a year of that time.

07:16.397 --> 07:18.840
He was really terrific.

07:20.502 --> 07:33.539
When they dedicated the portrait, his portrait, they asked me to make a few remarks, and I said, as far as I can recall, he was probably the best dean of anything I'd ever known anywhere.

07:35.501 --> 07:43.692
Howard, one time I made the remark, he said, I think some people don't get along too well at Dean Stone because he's so much smarter than they are.

07:47.047 --> 07:53.357
And the numbers were growing in every way during those years.

07:54.178 --> 08:00.788
What were the typical problems that you had to cope with as the chief academic officer?

08:01.049 --> 08:04.654
Well, the rapid growth of enrollment was one of the worst things.

08:04.754 --> 08:09.021
I could not make the board understand that we needed to cap this off and slow it down.

08:09.423 --> 08:13.409
And I remember Mr. Bright said, well, why isn't the University of Texas having this trouble?

08:13.429 --> 08:17.394
Well, Mr. Bright, they're not growing as fast as we are, and the appropriation keeps up with them better.

08:18.416 --> 08:27.389
And that's when we began taking, we talked the other day at our meeting about taking available fund money and supplementing faculty salaries because we simply had to.

08:28.330 --> 08:37.303
And the amount that we were putting in in those days was such that, as John Blocker said when I told him, we'll never catch up.

08:37.807 --> 08:51.841
And as the new Regents came on, some of them were really keen to try to get a grasp on the financial situation, but they didn't know the right questions to ask the financial people who are not about to volunteer any information.

08:52.501 --> 08:58.227
And they didn't think to come around and ask Howard and me, what questions should we ask?

08:58.247 --> 09:01.270
So the growth, the rapid growth was one of the things.

09:01.290 --> 09:06.295
We couldn't keep up with faculty, with facilities, and just have time to

09:07.051 --> 09:09.013
to digest this and settle it.

09:09.033 --> 09:11.516
So that was the biggest problem that I felt that we had.

09:12.477 --> 09:19.524
Did you ever have any regents try to interfere, micromanage?

09:21.686 --> 09:31.236
I had one who, through Jack Williams when I was dean of science, had one regent whom I really liked.

09:32.482 --> 09:41.435
asked Jack Williams to give a faculty job to a young person who had been not selected for tenure at another institution.

09:43.058 --> 09:45.381
And that was a hard thing to do.

09:47.004 --> 09:50.068
The department had cooperated nicely with me.

09:50.789 --> 09:56.718
Actually, the guy, I believe, had won the vote in his department and was turned down at an administrative level.

09:57.018 --> 09:59.502
He's turned out to be quite good here.

09:59.920 --> 10:04.570
That's the only time I can think of when a board member.

10:04.790 --> 10:20.443
But even in those tougher years, in the late 70s, you didn't have board members trying to tell you or chief academic officer what to do about this, that, or the other.

10:20.423 --> 10:21.444
I don't think I ever did.

10:23.247 --> 10:26.210
And I was on good terms with some of them.

10:26.230 --> 10:36.303
I wasn't bosom buddies with them, but we knew each other well and reasonably well, and they essentially didn't bother me.

10:37.404 --> 10:50.160
In those years when you were the chief academic officer, as you look back on it, of what are you most proud now in terms of accomplishments and goals achieved and so forth?

10:52.672 --> 11:05.908
I think that the emerging eminence in research of our university across the broad sweep would be, if I had anything to do with it, I guess I'm proudest of that.

11:06.028 --> 11:20.586
And also, I think that the recruitment of outstanding faculty was something that I took pleasure in.

11:21.815 --> 11:25.573
I think that the university has done well in recruiting extremely senior people.

11:26.518 --> 11:28.146
Did you know Derek Barton?

11:29.003 --> 11:33.409
I'd made him a time or two, but you know, this was quite a catch.

11:33.509 --> 11:34.691
I mean, I didn't have anything to do with it.

11:34.711 --> 11:35.231
It was long gone.

11:35.752 --> 11:46.026
But I asked Art Martellman, I said, now, does Barton live in England and drop in here for a week, a year, like that guy over at the University of Texas in chemistry?

11:46.486 --> 11:48.389
He said, Derek Barton lives in College Station.

11:48.409 --> 11:51.373
His laboratory is in our building, and he's there working every day.

11:52.074 --> 11:53.336
That's great.

11:53.356 --> 11:54.457
That's great.

11:54.958 --> 11:58.082
Of course, he had won his Nobel Prize in Britain,

11:58.838 --> 12:03.505
And then it had to retire from a job in France, but it was just, I thought, quite a catch to get.

12:03.806 --> 12:08.453
But we had prepared the way by getting people who attend to attract the Derek Bartons.

12:09.335 --> 12:19.210
And I think that faculty recruitment and our broad advances in research are two of the things that I'm proudest of.

12:19.679 --> 12:27.791
I think also the fact that we have maintained what I think is a good rapport with the students.

12:28.212 --> 12:35.963
In other words, I think that there's a much more family atmosphere here than in most universities.

12:36.484 --> 12:45.197
I think it's friendly and that probably the students feel like the university is smaller than it is.

12:46.207 --> 12:53.258
Do you remember any, as you look back, do you remember any missed opportunities now being armed with hindsight?

12:58.346 --> 13:01.691
Oh yeah, there are a lot of them.

13:04.135 --> 13:12.568
One thing, one specific thing that sticks in my mind, we had an opportunity to recruit Bob Marshak, who was at that time president of the City College of New York,

13:13.814 --> 13:21.745
preeminent theoretical physicist who wanted to come here and set up an institute of theoretical science, chemistry and physics.

13:21.765 --> 13:29.135
And we had it all worked out and somebody spilled the beans in New York, went down the drain.

13:31.197 --> 13:31.758
Any others?

13:35.824 --> 13:36.925
Can't think of any other.

13:37.326 --> 13:42.893
Any legislative and or board decisions that stymied something that could have been?

13:43.413 --> 13:46.940
Well, one thing that was a constant, two things that were constant frustration.

13:47.621 --> 13:53.993
One was the legislative mandate of teaching hours, which I think is wrong.

13:54.033 --> 13:58.542
And I heard Doyle Willis, who used to be a senator, and then he got beat there or he didn't run.

13:58.582 --> 14:00.085
Then he ran as a representative.

14:00.125 --> 14:01.227
And I was at a luncheon one time.

14:01.247 --> 14:04.393
He said, I don't think it's any of our business to do things like that.

14:04.413 --> 14:06.096
The universities ought to handle it.

14:06.430 --> 14:07.712
May your tribe increase.

14:08.393 --> 14:11.758
And the other thing, Haskell, is the lack of a sabbatical program.

14:12.018 --> 14:19.750
I think that's probably the worst faculty shortcoming that we have in the university.

14:20.992 --> 14:23.756
And I don't see us making any headway toward it.

14:23.936 --> 14:28.964
I have not seen any headway in all the years I've been here.

14:29.304 --> 14:34.632
During your vice presidential years, describe a typical work day.

14:38.662 --> 14:42.286
Including the luncheons and receptions.

14:42.306 --> 14:48.813
Well, gosh, I don't think any day was ever typical, Haskell, but I've never been an early morning person.

14:48.833 --> 15:01.668
I'd get to the office about 8, 15, 8, 10, or 15, and Betty Robinson, who was my secretary for 18 years, superb, and that managed my calendar and my appointments.

15:02.368 --> 15:05.732
I made it the point to see anybody who needed to see me, who thought he needed to see me.

15:06.404 --> 15:11.233
And I would do those things in the morning, would say,

15:11.703 --> 15:21.213
meet with the people there in the office, the way you and Howard and Jervis and I frequently would meet, just informally.

15:21.894 --> 15:25.137
I would have anybody who wanted to come in for a meeting.

15:25.778 --> 15:38.672
Then I'd probably go to Super Salad for lunch, and then go to APC Academic Programs Council at 1 o'clock, which would last till 2.30 or 3, I guess.

15:39.175 --> 15:44.121
go back and go through this gosh awful wad of papers that seemed to demand my signature.

15:45.042 --> 15:49.068
I would look for the initials PG by the signature line.

15:49.088 --> 15:50.189
If it was there, I signed it.

15:51.330 --> 15:55.976
I don't know how many orders for liquor I signed.

15:55.996 --> 16:01.063
But if Peter had checked it out, I knew it was ethical and legal.

16:01.984 --> 16:09.013
And then it may be that I've been invited to come and talk to a department or to

16:09.635 --> 16:16.885
a college meeting, and there may be a reception for some visiting person or a dinner that night.

16:17.386 --> 16:20.070
So it was, the days were pretty long, frankly.

16:20.410 --> 16:20.951
You know that.

16:21.812 --> 16:23.555
You've lived longer days than I have.

16:24.856 --> 16:38.055
And about what percentage of the middays were working lunches with some group, some appearance that you almost had to make?

16:40.786 --> 16:42.809
Not a terribly high percentage.

16:43.049 --> 16:49.759
I tended to shy away from a lot of these if I could and was pretty successful.

16:49.799 --> 16:55.708
And I'd say that not more than 15 percent, something like that.

16:56.228 --> 16:57.951
How many evenings were scheduled?

16:58.532 --> 16:59.253
Probably more than.

16:59.693 --> 17:05.562
Kitty, how many evenings of ours were preempted?

17:07.246 --> 17:08.508
30, 40 percent.

17:10.673 --> 17:10.933
That's right.

17:10.953 --> 17:11.935
And many weekends.

17:11.955 --> 17:13.037
And many weekends.

17:13.057 --> 17:14.601
Many weekends.

17:15.182 --> 17:20.953
See, one thing, I quit going to football games because for so many years, a football day was a day of work for me.

17:22.115 --> 17:25.602
And I couldn't go in and turn on the television if A&M's playing.

17:25.662 --> 17:28.528
If they're not playing, I don't even turn on the television.

17:28.508 --> 17:34.997
You mentioned a splendid secretary.

17:35.978 --> 17:38.562
What was her, as you saw it, what was her task?

17:41.125 --> 17:44.249
When I was dean of science, she ran the office.

17:45.651 --> 17:57.267
And when I became vice president, I took her over and I wanted her to manage my calendar, my correspondence, my appointments, my travel.

17:57.668 --> 18:01.993
And I wanted Jeanette to run the office because Jeanette had been running the office.

18:02.534 --> 18:06.058
And personality-wise, she's better at that than Betty is.

18:06.078 --> 18:09.742
Betty does not like to supervise other people, particularly.

18:10.043 --> 18:12.726
Jeanette doesn't mind doing it and does it superbly, I think.

18:13.527 --> 18:21.116
So after Jarvis had offered me the job and before it was announced, I made two phone calls.

18:21.636 --> 18:22.657
I called Jeanette Farris.

18:23.198 --> 18:24.840
I called Peter Green and I said,

18:26.322 --> 18:36.395
If it turns out that I am put in this job, I want you and you to stay exactly where you are.

18:37.477 --> 18:43.685
And I wanted them to know that, to have that opportunity before somebody else got to them.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.748
And Peter, what were his responsibilities?

18:46.150 --> 18:54.262
He was assistant vice president for, we put him in for a change of title and promotion, assistant vice president for academic budgets.

18:55.483 --> 18:57.426
And he was our budgeteer.

18:58.348 --> 19:00.331
He really took that responsibility off my shoulders.

19:01.692 --> 19:04.757
And then, let's see.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.601
That's it, isn't it?

19:07.801 --> 19:07.901
Yeah.

19:07.921 --> 19:14.311
Of course, the receptionist and typing pool and so forth.

19:14.631 --> 19:15.212
All right.

19:16.036 --> 19:24.748
When you came over, did Jarvis tell you that anybody wants to stay, like me or anybody else, or was that entirely you were?

19:24.768 --> 19:25.229
That's up to me.

19:25.429 --> 19:26.711
That's what I assume.

19:26.731 --> 19:28.333
Yeah.

19:28.353 --> 19:32.439
Well, since you were a dean, I knew you were in place.

19:32.639 --> 19:37.786
I didn't worry about you because I figured that the fact that you were a dean, you were going to stay there.

19:38.367 --> 19:40.710
I knew that engineering would grab

19:40.943 --> 19:46.510
Peter and Jeanette like that if they figured.

19:46.530 --> 19:54.700
So I didn't bother you because I knew as a dean you were going to stay there.

19:55.281 --> 20:01.649
But no, he didn't issue any instructions on that line.

20:01.689 --> 20:02.850
It's what I wanted to do.

20:03.387 --> 20:06.773
See if you agree with this generalization that I've reached.

20:06.833 --> 20:22.358
During those Williams-Rutter years, we had a pleasant mix in key roles of people that had long experience here and people whose experience was somewhere else.

20:23.300 --> 20:25.422
It wasn't all of one or all of the other.

20:25.442 --> 20:27.104
That's correct, absolutely.

20:27.124 --> 20:38.776
And today I fear it's more of the outsiders, that the nervous reaction is, oh, that somebody from outside is always better.

20:41.759 --> 20:42.259
Let's see.

20:44.301 --> 20:47.805
The library reported to you

20:48.528 --> 20:49.549
Dr. Hoadley.

20:49.729 --> 20:52.992
Dr. Hoadley, and she had been selected by Calhoun.

20:53.212 --> 20:53.593
Correct.

20:55.494 --> 20:59.258
What other non... Oh, let's see.

20:59.298 --> 21:15.172
The library... Research Foundation by then is entirely... It's independent.

21:15.312 --> 21:16.273
Independent.

21:16.844 --> 21:20.735
reports to its own counselors and board.

21:21.617 --> 21:22.941
So there really wasn't any?

21:23.222 --> 21:24.004
That's about it.

21:24.044 --> 21:26.792
The academic college is in the library.

21:26.812 --> 21:27.855
All right.

21:29.199 --> 21:32.187
Let's go near the end of my years here.

21:33.500 --> 21:52.325
As I recall, sometime in the spring of 1980, in one of our after five o'clock conversations in President Miller's office, we were talking about his frustration with the stations and services reporting to the system instead of to the campus.

21:53.207 --> 22:00.857
And I recall you and Howard particularly saying, Jarvis, you know, back off.

22:00.837 --> 22:05.242
And my memory is that he kind of said, yeah, you're right, you're right.

22:05.703 --> 22:12.711
And one of you, I think, even said, look, Jarvis, if you just sit tight, Hubert's going to retire in a couple years.

22:13.552 --> 22:13.972
Who knows?

22:13.992 --> 22:14.353
You might.

22:15.254 --> 22:15.954
All right.

22:16.976 --> 22:23.503
As we get near that board meeting in the fall of, in summer of 1980,

22:24.800 --> 22:32.081
Were you aware of any coming crisis regarding Dr. Miller as president?

22:33.144 --> 22:33.284
No.

22:33.605 --> 22:34.708
I knew that

22:35.988 --> 22:48.132
He had prepared a briefing book to send to the board members about the organization, about the reporting and so forth, and cooperation or lack thereof between the system and the president's office.

22:49.214 --> 22:55.085
And the evening before that board meeting, you remember I wired you and I called you in El Paso.

22:55.687 --> 22:57.490
But the evening before that,

22:58.297 --> 23:07.948
The Vestals, the Prescotts, and the Millers had dinner at the President's home with two board members and the Chancellor.

23:08.228 --> 23:09.269
That's Tuesday night?

23:09.850 --> 23:11.352
Uh-huh.

23:11.732 --> 23:15.116
Wednesday is the night of the decisions.

23:15.456 --> 23:16.798
Okay, you're right.

23:17.158 --> 23:20.662
They normally meet on the... You're saying, and the Chancellor.

23:20.682 --> 23:21.503
And the Chancellor.

23:22.073 --> 23:35.337
And everything was pleasant, no hint of any storm clouds on the horizon, and the next evening President Miller was out.

23:35.577 --> 23:42.850
Let me add to the tape recorder's contents that that Tuesday morning, the morning before that dinner you just mentioned,

23:43.353 --> 24:07.015
You hosted a going away reception for me at mid-morning in the Koch building, and early that morning it occurred to me that I should go over and thank the chancellor, my seventh grade band director, my twelfth grade principal, who became dean of arts and sciences the same summer that I got a temporary nine-month job teaching history here.

24:07.636 --> 24:16.129
In that, as I was saying thank you to him and getting ready to leave, he said, sit down, I need to chat with you a second.

24:16.310 --> 24:20.777
Oh, and he asked me to name the five best department heads on the campus.

24:21.858 --> 24:25.023
And I quickly said, well, gee, I don't know what I can do five.

24:25.104 --> 24:29.771
Let me do, just go through each of the colleges right quickly and tell you the ones that come to mind.

24:30.392 --> 24:32.395
He asked me to do engineering first.

24:33.674 --> 24:39.123
I mentioned Charlie Holland and one or two others and he said, you didn't mention Chuck Sampson.

24:39.143 --> 24:41.848
And I said, well, sir, he's not a department head anymore.

24:42.850 --> 24:43.912
He said, well, why isn't he?

24:44.913 --> 24:52.847
I didn't want to tell him that I had understood there had been some complaints some months earlier.

24:52.979 --> 24:58.666
And he asked me a bunch of other questions about Dr. Sampson.

24:59.908 --> 25:17.071
And so when I got back to the reception, I pulled you and Dr. Miller aside and said, hey, yesterday morning at staff meeting there was mention that one of the things that may come up at this board meeting with Regents this week is the selection of a new Vice Chancellor for Engineering.

25:17.531 --> 25:21.096
I think I may have gotten a clue a while ago who it might be.

25:21.380 --> 25:27.228
And I described that, and I remember everybody in the group kind of saying, yeah, yeah, that could be, could be.

25:28.991 --> 25:35.880
So that when we drove away, I certainly wasn't aware of any crisis.

25:36.662 --> 25:39.085
Then when we got to El Paso,

25:39.773 --> 25:59.976
And after spending the late afternoon and early evening looking at the house where we were going to be living, trying to figure out how the furniture would fit in, we got at the motel that note to call you, and when I got the note, we were late getting back, it was then 10.30 Mountain Time.

26:01.019 --> 26:02.721
And my wife said, what is it?

26:02.741 --> 26:04.023
And I said, I don't know.

26:04.303 --> 26:06.827
It's to call at Dr. Miller's house.

26:06.907 --> 26:08.368
And she said, what do you think it is?

26:08.429 --> 26:12.454
And I said, well, I know it's not him saying, well, good luck, we're thinking about you.

26:12.894 --> 26:14.897
I said, it's got to be something important.

26:14.917 --> 26:15.958
What do you think it is?

26:16.098 --> 26:22.307
And I said, well, perhaps one of the Miller daughters has had an accident and then an attempt to add humor.

26:22.407 --> 26:24.469
I said, but the board's meeting this week.

26:24.609 --> 26:25.290
Anything is fine.

26:25.310 --> 26:26.352
Anything can happen.

26:26.372 --> 26:29.676
Then I'm awakened the next morning by 8 o'clock.

26:30.550 --> 26:38.857
before 8 o'clock mountain time with some newspaper reporters calling from here, Austin and Houston.

26:38.877 --> 26:40.939
They had somehow found out where I was.

26:41.459 --> 26:45.663
They wanted to know my opinion and that's how I learned what had happened.

26:46.083 --> 26:49.926
How did you first become aware of what had happened?

26:49.946 --> 26:55.111
We were at a reception over at the, down at Ramada Inn, I believe it was.

26:56.011 --> 26:58.734
Oh, architecture, wasn't it?

26:58.754 --> 26:58.834
Hmm?

26:58.854 --> 27:00.355
Wasn't it architecture reception?

27:01.178 --> 27:13.811
I don't know, it's the usual suspects there, and the board, some board members walked in, and is this censored?

27:14.633 --> 27:17.280
One of them announced, well, we fired the son of a bitch.

27:18.458 --> 27:21.982
which I thought was a reflection of a considerable lack of class.

27:23.605 --> 27:33.737
And then we got a call to come to the president's house and I got Perry and told Kitty, take Francis home.

27:34.979 --> 27:40.686
And we went over there and fell out of the blue.

27:41.888 --> 27:45.192
Now, as I understand it, the board had had lunch

27:46.049 --> 28:02.078
with Dr. and Mrs. Miller at the President's house on Wednesday and then had gone over and convened in a meeting that was not officially announced as a board meeting.

28:03.761 --> 28:09.812
If that's correct, therefore by the narrow reading of Texas law it was an

28:10.602 --> 28:20.013
I wasn't aware, or if I was, I'd forgotten that it was not under the Open Meetings Act.

28:20.073 --> 28:32.408
I have heard in hindsight that Dr. Miller thought after the luncheon, and then your mention of the previous evening, that he was optimistic

28:32.995 --> 28:41.174
Oh, after the board members and the chancellor had left, we sat there with the Millers for a while, and he turned to Howard and we said, well, what do you think?

28:41.194 --> 28:41.955
How do things go?

28:42.677 --> 28:44.441
Well, things are very pleasant.

28:44.501 --> 28:45.985
Everything seems fine.

28:47.187 --> 28:50.515
And there were no reasons given.

28:51.507 --> 28:56.433
And he, correct me if I'm wrong, he was summoned over 5 o'clock or so.

28:56.453 --> 28:58.456
I believe that's right, uh-huh.

28:58.476 --> 29:08.168
To come over to the board area of the MSC and there they read him the statement that he was terminated as of that day.

29:08.188 --> 29:09.049
I believe that's correct.

29:10.891 --> 29:13.414
And they did not give him any.

29:15.048 --> 29:18.753
Anywise, as far as I'm aware, nothing was said.

29:21.236 --> 29:27.604
Then did any board member say anything to you at that reception or anything else?

29:27.804 --> 29:30.067
No.

29:30.247 --> 29:31.228
All right.

29:31.829 --> 29:35.714
When did they appoint the interim president?

29:35.734 --> 29:37.817
I believe the next morning, but I'm not sure.

29:38.598 --> 29:44.565
So the next part of this would be to try to capture the transition.

29:46.925 --> 29:56.430
So Chuck Sampson becomes the interim president and he is physically in place Monday morning?

29:56.731 --> 29:57.593
I think so.

29:59.125 --> 30:16.938
Dr. Hubert brought him over to, I believe we called a meeting of the deans, and we met in that conference room on second floor of Coke, and Dr. Hubert brought him in and presented him as the acting president and said, I'll leave him in your capable hands.

30:16.958 --> 30:20.685
All right.

30:21.467 --> 30:22.669
What were Chuck's?

30:23.037 --> 30:28.302
What were Dr. Sampson's first actions?

30:28.382 --> 30:35.910
Did he meet with each of you vice presidents?

30:35.930 --> 30:36.590
I'm sure he did.

30:36.611 --> 30:42.857
I don't remember the details, but I'm sure he did to get oriented on what we were doing and where things were.

30:43.257 --> 30:45.079
Did you get any directions?

30:45.660 --> 30:51.205
Did you get any guidance from him that you were to change any directions?

30:51.978 --> 30:53.179
No, I don't think so.

30:53.720 --> 30:58.084
And see, he's still, he's very tentative in that he's designated as acting.

30:58.465 --> 31:08.435
And also, I think he felt that it was too early to institute any changes.

31:08.475 --> 31:19.386
The only thing that he, I recall, the only initiative that he brought forth was that group of faculty meetings that I told you about earlier.

31:20.429 --> 31:48.934
he was uh well you uh well you know him he's a he's a nice nice guy easygoing and pleasant and and uh i'd say a thoroughly ethical and moral guy and uh but uh very low-key and as an administrator i would call him very low-key and he was hard worker oh yes yeah oh yeah that you know they would he would leave with

31:49.775 --> 31:52.984
two satchels full of stuff to be signed and taken.
