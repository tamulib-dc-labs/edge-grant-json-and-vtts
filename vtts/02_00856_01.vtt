WEBVTT

00:00.858 --> 00:11.494
I was

00:00.858 --> 00:11.494
born in Medina County in December the 8th, 1892. I 
was born right on in a ranch house.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.390
It's 25 miles from town.

00:24.394 --> 00:25.837
What town? Hondo.

00:30.035 --> 00:36.924
Those days, well, I'd say every member of our 
family was born in that ranch house. We was a family

00:36.944 --> 00:38.846
of 12 children. Large family. Very large family. 
Could you tell us your dad's name? Henry, Henry

00:44.394 --> 00:46.356
Rothery. And your mother? And her name was Anna 
Reinhardt.

00:55.148 --> 00:57.831
She was coming from another old family of ours. of 
German immigrant family and ranch people. She

01:06.832 --> 01:10.177
comes from a large family. She was very, she was 
very well adapted to ranch life. Knew what it, and

01:15.726 --> 01:23.679
it was a hard,

01:15.726 --> 01:23.679
it was a hard life, you might say. You know, when 
you, when the mother takes care of a family of that

01:27.730 --> 01:50.594
size and together with oh I'd say we had we 
maintained probably a half a dozen ranch hands

01:27.730 --> 01:50.594
beside that and to cook and feed them do all that 
laundry.

01:53.216 --> 01:55.599
That was a hard a hard life for a woman too. It was but 
she was I say she was well enough. She was a very,

01:58.644 --> 02:03.468
very big woman. Big frame, I mean, all muscle.

02:11.096 --> 02:24.889
To maintain that, I mean, the schedule that she had 
to get up, oh,

02:11.096 --> 02:24.889
probably got up between four and five o'clock in 
the morning to start the day's program. and

02:27.029 --> 02:32.157
breakfast food ready for the men that started out 
to work. And they usually left the ranch house all

02:32.217 --> 02:36.142
daybreak.

02:38.766 --> 02:50.984
And

02:38.766 --> 02:50.984
she lived to be, she died of a ruptured appendix 
when she was 78 years old. She didn't know she was

02:51.104 --> 02:54.089
even bothered with it. She'd been out. She'd been 
out fishing with a sister of hers, and they had

02:56.341 --> 03:08.537
walked ten miles up and down the stream out there on 
the frill with a fish pole. At 78. That's

03:09.298 --> 03:12.001
marvelous.

03:14.344 --> 03:18.970
She had a very strong constitution. I think that's 
one of the things that's more so than my father. My

03:22.795 --> 03:26.179
father was not... He was a more of a, he was a pretty 
good horse trader. And he proved it in his

03:33.722 --> 03:36.805
operations. He was, he uh, I guess at one time had at 
least 50,000 acres in one tract of land in Medina

03:36.865 --> 03:54.124
County and 20,000 acres more out there. Oh, in 
Brackettville, I believe. That's...

04:00.667 --> 04:09.375
I think it's Emmett County, I'm not sure, but it's 
around out there, and it was in that county of

04:00.667 --> 04:09.375
Brackettville. And he left all his children 
pretty well set up. He left his old $50,000 piece.

04:14.981 --> 04:17.523
That's the closest I'd hold that on. Well, it's 
been a long time. Can you tell us a little bit about

04:23.618 --> 04:27.604
your boyhood, your experiences? Yes. He moved us, 
of course, he moved the family to San Antonio. Like

04:34.133 --> 04:36.496
I say, he was strongly interested in education. 
And so we could go to school. And he moved, that was

04:40.982 --> 04:49.474
the first time that I ever saw a train was about in 
1895 when We drove down from that ranch to get on

04:50.146 --> 04:54.853
that train to go to San Antonio. Must have been 
quite an experience. It was, I'll tell you. I know

04:57.697 --> 05:00.781
we got to San Antonio. We lived there in San Antonio 
then until about 19, until 1905 or 6 or 7, along in

05:00.841 --> 05:10.615
there. At that time, Hondo had, it had developed 
the way that they voted out. a school district and

05:19.103 --> 05:31.822
build a pretty good schoolhouse, and he thought it 
would be more convenient to move the family back to

05:19.103 --> 05:31.822
Hondo, closer to his place, to where he was in 
business. He was, of

05:34.025 --> 05:43.779
course, spending quite a bit of his time then in 
Hondo itself. He was president of the bank there.

05:47.124 --> 05:48.486
He had tried operating a big mercantile business, 
which didn't turn out too successfully as he was

05:50.153 --> 05:59.042
too trustful. He didn't even watch his business 
and they turned it over to a friend and they left him

05:59.142 --> 06:19.823
about $120,000 in the red when his creditors came 
in and wanted to know what he was going to do about

05:59.142 --> 06:19.823
his business.

06:20.377 --> 06:49.675
in hondo well i finished the public schools and 
then attended

06:20.377 --> 06:49.675
a preparatory school in san antonio for a year 
before i went to a m and had an a m in 19 in the fall of

06:20.377 --> 06:49.675
1911. why did you go to a m why did you pick that 
school well i imagine i'd had um three other

06:20.377 --> 06:49.675
brothers there before me and i think my father of 
course as he is associated, I might say his life

06:50.110 --> 07:13.305
work was associated with his cattle and 
agriculture, that he was interested more in his

06:50.110 --> 07:13.305
children going to the school of an agricultural 
school than Texas University. He had no use. I

07:14.587 --> 07:18.413
remember some of the boys said they probably want 
to go to Austin to study law, Texas University. He

07:22.290 --> 07:29.479
says you go to A&M or study some form of 
engineering. I had a brother then that he went to

07:29.499 --> 07:45.598
Michigan School of Mines and another brother went 
to Ohio State and studied veterinary science.

07:45.983 --> 07:48.746
Now, when did you enter Anaheim? In the fall of 
when? 1911. 1911. My first year down there was the

07:51.950 --> 07:55.434
year they started. They had the idea of, I don't 
know, they burned down all the old buildings.

08:01.501 --> 08:02.842
Something happened, yes. You heard that story, I 
guess. Well, I knew they burned, but I don't know

08:04.925 --> 08:07.608
about the story of it. Well, I don't know it either, 
but then the fact that so many of them burned up,

08:07.628 --> 08:13.374
it's... Unusual. It almost got the idea that 
somebody was mixed up with it. They burned up the

08:22.723 --> 08:28.911
old mess hall, the one they called the old original 
Speeder mess hall.

08:31.915 --> 08:43.311
Then they burned up the main building, which 
brought the school, I'd say, to a stop, because

08:31.915 --> 08:43.311
most of the classrooms were in the main building. 
And they

08:44.303 --> 08:53.895
disrupted, of course, burning up the missile.

08:57.640 --> 09:11.357
They suspended school for 30 days and in the 
meantime put up a temporary missile, built it out

08:57.640 --> 09:11.357
there out of sheet iron. Oh, I don't believe they 
had a concrete floor. I believe they just put in a

09:15.119 --> 09:21.065
plain old floor in there and a sheet iron side and 
roof on it. Wooden floor. Yeah, wooden floor. And

09:24.809 --> 09:33.178
they used that building then until they built the, 
I guess, the old, the present mess hall is still in

09:24.809 --> 09:33.178
use, isn't it? Visa Hall is still in use, yes. Where 
did you live that first year? I, my first year in

09:38.263 --> 09:42.087
school, I was in Foster Hall. at one of the old 
dormitories. My last GI, they gave me a company

09:45.572 --> 09:54.982
captainship and put me over there in Milner. 
Uh-huh, and still there. Still there. Milner's

09:56.784 --> 09:57.465
still there. Foster Hall's gone. And I think 
George Crawford was in my company. Yes, I believe

10:03.671 --> 10:05.273
he was. What other recollections do you have of 
that first year on the campus there? How did the

10:11.665 --> 10:13.146
school impress you? What was it like? Oh, well, of 
course it was so different from anything I had ever

10:14.308 --> 10:24.838
come in contact with. The first thing that was a, we 
were entering the

10:37.028 --> 10:41.494
the football

10:37.028 --> 10:41.494
season. And there was one form of hazing that they 
had there. They'd bring out all the fish. They'd

10:51.887 --> 10:54.690
assemble all the fish and put them in nightshade. 
And that was the days before pajamas.

11:01.109 --> 11:06.978
put on their nightshades and frayed them around 
all over the campus.

11:13.608 --> 11:23.042
We'd go all up and down where the professors would 
live in what they called Quality Row. Does it still

11:24.744 --> 11:26.146
go by that name? Oh, it's gone, but I've got 
pictures of it. No, it's been torn down. Yeah, we

11:31.518 --> 11:36.624
had those pep rallies. Went on for quite 
frequently. I'd say that we had a pep rally at, oh,

11:40.608 --> 11:46.174
two or three every week. They call them yell 
practices now. Do they call them yell practices?

11:49.698 --> 11:50.839
Yell practice, yes. Yes. And yell leaders. Right, 
we still have them. No girls. No girls in the yell

11:56.506 --> 11:58.588
leaders. And

11:59.767 --> 12:04.053
you went there in 1911. And that was one of the 
things that impressed me about our year leader. He

12:09.079 --> 12:11.723
was an old boy from Millinder. And he come out of way 
out of the Morpha. Morpha or West of Morpha. And he

12:25.020 --> 12:27.343
was a almost every week for non-regulation 
uniform because he wouldn't wear anything but

12:28.808 --> 12:38.117
boots with his trousers stuck to the top of his 
boots. Do you remember his name? Yeah, Milliner.

12:40.980 --> 12:41.420
Milliner? Yeah. Lindy. Lindy Milliner. 
Milliner.

12:47.586 --> 12:47.686
Okay. I met him through World War I. I ran across him 
over there in France. He was a captain. I was his

12:52.331 --> 12:53.292
chaplain.

12:56.335 --> 12:58.537
And you said you went there in 1911? Mm-hmm. When 
did you graduate? The 17th. So you must have had

13:01.925 --> 13:03.947
some time off. Yes, they gave me time off. Because, 
you know, the old hazing, it was pretty much, it was

13:06.871 --> 13:15.902
practiced pretty heavily in those days. And you 
had, those were the days when

13:15.922 --> 13:24.852
they had no heat except stoves. And there was no... 
the water, you got your water from a hydrant

13:29.592 --> 13:33.976
outside. And all them sophomores and 
upperclassmen, the fish had to always go out and

13:35.258 --> 13:49.031
keep their wood box filled up and keep their water 
bucket full. And if you didn't, if you was a

13:49.051 --> 13:58.941
sophomore's fish and he come up there and there was 
no wood there, boy, you was in a in trouble. I was,

14:03.007 --> 14:16.445
from my early training, I was,

14:03.007 --> 14:16.445
I guess in the habit of keeping myself pretty neat. 
You had to take care of your own uniform. You got

14:21.832 --> 14:22.954
yourself You only had the old cadet grays at that 
time. There was no khakis. And you had to keep them

14:30.774 --> 14:37.461
trousers pressed pretty good if you wanted to look 
good.

14:41.265 --> 14:43.608
We did guard duty. I don't think they do that 
anymore. No, not much. But all the guard duty was,

14:48.413 --> 14:53.498
the cadets had had to do three, what they call, 
three tours of guard duty at night. It went on from 7

15:02.092 --> 15:05.577
to 10 o'clock, and that was the study period. And 
during that study period, there was supposed to be

15:06.719 --> 15:17.376
a sentry in that dormitory, in that hall, just 
walking round and round. And I remember my first

15:18.908 --> 15:22.994
night, I came on sentry duty. I was in the legate, 
and there was a bunch of football players in there.

15:32.828 --> 15:38.196
And somebody stuck his head out and said, uh-oh, 
got a fish on sentry tonight. And they almost tore

15:38.917 --> 15:42.142
that dormitory to pieces. They run all over me 
because I was a fish, you know. And then up comes up.

15:48.440 --> 15:53.850
And the cadet major, I'll never forget that bird, 
he almost got me canned. Oh, I tell you, man, he'd

15:55.734 --> 16:00.202
come up there and yank me up. You want to know what I 
meant by letting all this disturbance going on on

16:00.223 --> 16:06.575
my post? Why, I didn't stop him. I said, I can't do 
nothing with them big football players. He says,

16:13.516 --> 16:14.998
you're on charge. You got your gun, your bayonet. 
He said, just take after them. Get them out of

16:20.284 --> 16:20.985
there. And then he made me go through all my general 
orders and my special orders. I knew all that

16:28.053 --> 16:34.841
stuff. And then his final instruction when he left 
me says I want you to report yourself to the

16:37.613 --> 17:02.845
guardhouse when you're going on for for allowing 
this disturbance

16:37.613 --> 17:02.845
so when I got off I went into the to the sergeant of 
the guard and made my report he says yay sergeant of

16:37.613 --> 17:02.845
guard says The majors already beat you to it.

17:08.238 --> 17:16.409
And that was an unusual coincidence that got me off 
of the hook on that deal. The brother that went to

17:17.952 --> 17:30.790
Ohio State was coming home one summer and in the 
Pullman with him, was a young lieutenant out of

17:32.002 --> 17:37.911
West Point who was reporting to A&M as a commander. 
And my brother was telling him that he had a younger

17:37.931 --> 17:44.421
brother who was going to A&M that fall.

17:47.106 --> 17:55.118
And so when I,

17:47.106 --> 17:55.118
we call that the RAM list for any misdemeanor. I 
don't know whether they still have a misdemeanor

17:55.138 --> 17:58.904
list or not. But every night, Every night at 
supper, the adjutant would read out the RAM list.

18:06.888 --> 18:11.033
And then it would be a list of 150 names at least. 
Every night. And there was my name on there that

18:14.857 --> 18:22.507
night for...

18:14.857 --> 18:22.507
And I got the maximum amount of demerits. How many 
was that? I think it was five on one offense. Five

18:27.132 --> 18:27.793
demerits. And I... and with instructions to 
report to the, to the commandant.

18:38.594 --> 18:46.863
Well, I walk into the commandant's office, told 
him my name, and he says, yes, he says, I know you. He

18:47.724 --> 18:52.169
says, you know, I had a nice visit with your 
brother. He says, we came, I came down here riding

18:52.349 --> 18:59.637
on the Pullman with him, and he, he told me about his 
early experiences at A&M and that that he had a

19:01.051 --> 19:08.988
younger brother, and you were him, the younger 
brother of the man I met, and I said, yes. And we

19:10.752 --> 19:14.079
talked on a little bit, and he was telling me how 
much he enjoyed. He said, I'll tell you what you do,

19:15.001 --> 19:17.085
he says, Just write an explanation to me about that 
and I'll take care of it. And boy, I wrote my

19:24.117 --> 19:33.665
explanation and

19:24.117 --> 19:33.665
he scratched off the demerits of me. Because if 
there's one thing, I'll say, that my father wasn't

19:33.685 --> 19:40.611
put up with, and that was disobedience. And I knew 
how that was going to stand in my quarter You see, we

19:49.482 --> 19:53.667
had two terms at that time. We had two terms, and my 
report home with those demerits on it, and I was

19:53.687 --> 20:05.582
working my head off to get those demerits off me, so 
when my report goes home, no demerit. And that's

20:06.122 --> 20:14.332
what I meant about that I had acquired the habit of 
keeping myself in sort of a spit and polish

20:06.122 --> 20:14.332
condition. When I turned out to guard my office, 
When you went up to Gordon in those days, the

20:18.794 --> 20:45.173
adjutant would inspect you, and after he looked 
through, you know, inspect your rifle, your

20:18.794 --> 20:45.173
general appearance and everything, and he'd pick 
out the cadet that had the neatest appearance, and

20:18.794 --> 20:45.173
for that he got five demerit credits, and excused 
from walking a post. And that's one of the things

20:50.406 --> 20:53.649
that got me into trouble in a way. Because I used to 
have to, for the sophomores, that when they got on

20:54.790 --> 21:08.184
guard duty, they'd come down and say, say, Fish, 
I'm on guard mount this morning. He said, get

21:08.204 --> 21:13.810
yourself all fixed up and go on out there to guard 
mount and come back with them five points of credit

21:08.204 --> 21:13.810
for me. And I'd go out to the guard mount and then get 
around. If I got the credit to ask me what my name,

21:18.904 --> 21:26.695
I'd give the name of their sophomore.

21:27.376 --> 21:29.900
That agent says, how many names you got? That's 
good. That's really good.

21:37.131 --> 21:40.756
Now, you left A&M for a while. Oh, yeah. Next year, I 
come back. Of course, I was a bigot. And

21:44.232 --> 21:49.298
I got deported on a fish. And we made the mistake, 
one of the fish in the company that was in the old Ann

21:50.699 --> 22:01.191
Foster Hall was the son of a state senator. And when 
he went home at Christmas, he complained to his

22:01.211 --> 22:13.085
father about the terrible treatment that he was 
subjected to down in that hazing. And the senator,

22:14.860 --> 22:18.505
came back to Austin and reported it to the 
governor. And the governor wrote the president a

22:19.807 --> 22:33.807
letter of the conditions that was going down there 
and ordered an explanation and for him to check

22:19.807 --> 22:33.807
into it and make a report. And one day, in about the 
first, it was either the first or the second week

22:33.827 --> 22:42.640
after January when it got back, why

22:45.218 --> 22:57.609
the company, our company commander, I think, as I 
remember, his name was Oliver. He says, no, it

22:58.851 --> 23:02.494
wasn't him. It was the old bull himself. They

23:07.799 --> 23:12.323
called the... the commandant, the bull in those 
days. Still called military, regular military

23:19.617 --> 23:23.141
bulls. Well, the old commandant, he'd come out 
there and he said, and he read off these names and he

23:23.861 --> 23:35.493
said, I read these names, you will step one pace 
forward. Well, as was a custom in those days, the

23:37.274 --> 23:43.120
fish all had the rear rank, and the upperclassmen 
had the front rank. And when he got through calling

23:47.291 --> 23:52.158
the names, the front rank had stepped one piece 
forward. And he said, you men whose names I've

23:53.600 --> 24:13.208
called will be excused from drill, but you will put 
your guns and bayonets away and report to the

23:53.600 --> 24:13.208
disciplining committee in one hour.

24:15.770 --> 24:24.341
And he was, he was, he had a wonderful memory for 
names. I only appeared before him when I reported

24:25.823 --> 24:34.774
back in, I mean, at the first school. And there was a 
new commandant there, the one I was talking about

24:35.935 --> 24:40.581
the first. He had been assigned to another, tour of 
duty somewhere else. And this fellow's name was

24:48.107 --> 24:55.296
Levi G. Brown. I always remember that name because 
when they read the land list, the ram list, it says,

24:56.418 --> 25:05.149
by order of Levi G. Brown, Commandant.

25:08.834 --> 25:12.338
And Levi...

25:14.056 --> 25:17.501
When I walked up before the district committee, he 
just called my name out. Brother H.H. He didn't ask

25:20.685 --> 25:22.147
me what my name was. He called me. And he said, 
you've been accused by cadet so-and-so, and he

25:24.631 --> 25:40.333
named the son of the senator, for taking part in a 
hazing incident just before Christmas.

25:43.132 --> 25:45.495
And he says, are you guilty or not guilty? I said, 
I'm guilty. That's all. And we were all expelled.

25:52.604 --> 25:53.926
My goodness. And that's when the cadet corps went 
on a strike. All 27, there was 27 of us, got canned

25:58.752 --> 26:05.320
out of there. Well, they didn't say how long a time 
we just came. We were reinstated. the following,

26:11.178 --> 26:14.743
during the summer sometime, and I went back in the 
summer. So I came back, I started taking

26:16.406 --> 26:23.496
architecture. That was my architectural 
engineering.

26:30.486 --> 26:39.700
And

26:30.486 --> 26:39.700
I came back, and when I walked into that 
commandant's office, I just stuck my head in the

26:40.861 --> 26:50.254
door, and there was old Brown sitting over there, 
and he looked up and he says, Rory, I'm glad to see

26:40.861 --> 26:50.254
you back. He didn't hesitate a moment.

26:56.502 --> 27:00.668
That's why I say he had a marvelous memory for 
names. You said there was a strike. Do you know

27:02.531 --> 27:05.054
anything about that strike, what went on then? 
Well, it was dissolved. in just what way, and all

27:09.717 --> 27:18.130
the cadets that would come back, there were no 
charges filed against them. But you left, you

27:18.831 --> 27:20.894
weren't there during the strike. Oh no, I had to 
leave. I mean, we were told to leave and get off that

27:23.437 --> 27:27.804
campus before 12 o'clock that night. Right, 
goodness. And we left there, and we caught, there

27:30.147 --> 27:38.560
was a night train left there just about 11 o'clock, 
and we caught that How many got expelled along with

27:39.299 --> 27:42.522
you? How many was there? Twenty-seven. Are they 
all sophomores? Sophomores and juniors. What

27:48.407 --> 27:50.489
incident provoked this? That hazing. What did 
y'all do that was so bad and got you kicked out?

27:55.794 --> 27:57.936
Well, just give them a good strapping. Before you 
went home Christmas, that was our Christmas

27:58.637 --> 28:01.239
present. We lined up all the fish. It was a general 
practice. Just before you go home Christmas, All

28:09.067 --> 28:15.758
the upperclassmen would line you up and they'd all 
take a whack at your rear end with a belt.

28:18.282 --> 28:20.385
And so this boy thought he had a little too much. 
Well, yeah, and he was a son of a senator. Oh, I see.

28:26.095 --> 28:28.539
Well, that shouldn't have made him too popular. 
No, he'd never come back.

28:34.733 --> 28:36.295
Oh, my goodness. So you had to lay out then for that 
second semester in the summer then. And then I sort

28:40.821 --> 28:46.808
of lost my contact. Well, I didn't lose it too bad, 
but I was a pretty fair student. But I was taking

28:53.637 --> 28:58.082
part and I was a pretty fair track man. I'll just put 
it that way. I had one time I held a record in the

29:03.893 --> 29:12.305
broad jump in the pole vault for the state. I didn't 
know that. What year did you hold that record?

29:15.590 --> 29:24.584
Well, I set it in 15, and it was broken by an A&M man in 
1919. That must have been quite an honor to hold

29:24.604 --> 29:28.209
that. Well, I thought it was.

29:34.808 --> 29:39.414
But I just had another incident about this fellow 
Bull Brown. I was, I came down here, down here to the

29:41.436 --> 29:55.714
valley and the American Legion post had an idea, 
you know, they come, we'll make us a war picture and

29:41.436 --> 29:55.714
make us some money. And we didn't have no 
equipment. And Ringgold, that's an army post

29:59.328 --> 30:02.753
right up here in Rio Grande City. It's up about,

30:04.095 --> 30:13.749
it's about 25, 30 miles up there, right up the river 
road. And another fellow was put on, we'd had some

30:13.769 --> 30:22.742
contact with Ringgold up there. Well, we put on a 
committee to go up there and see him, but if we could

30:22.762 --> 30:27.208
borrow some uniforms, and some army equipment, 
rifles and something, to make this picture with.

30:34.177 --> 30:35.479
And we didn't think his name. And we walked into the 
Adjutant's office. We both knew him. There was a

30:42.449 --> 30:44.391
fellow with me. He was a veterinarian and a doctor 
here by the name of Ootsman. And we walked in there

30:50.059 --> 30:52.523
and we was talking to this Adjutant. And the 
Adjutant says, We told him what our mission was,

30:55.353 --> 31:02.764
that we wanted to borrow some uniform and maybe 
some ordnance, rifles and stuff like that. We had a

31:02.884 --> 31:08.011
plan of making a picture down there, a movie 
picture. One of these promoters come along, you

31:09.153 --> 31:16.323
know how they do, come into a small town and try to 
promote something to make some money on. And he

31:19.107 --> 31:21.330
sold us on this idea of making this movie. Well, He 
says, the agent says to us, he says, you know, this

31:24.462 --> 31:33.574
place has just turned, had a turnover of 
commanding officers. And the new commanding

31:34.596 --> 31:38.481
officer, he just got here yesterday. And he said, 
there's his office. He said, I can't say I don't

31:41.044 --> 31:44.729
know him too well. He said, I've been here a day. He 
said, I'm sure he'd be cooperative just going in,

31:47.593 --> 31:51.899
just tell him what your deal is. I think he'd help 
out now. I looked around like that, we both looked

31:54.668 --> 31:59.613
around, and there was Bo Brown. He said, Rory, come 
on in here. I want to talk to you. When was this? When

32:05.579 --> 32:06.981
did you do it? When was this? What date? Do you 
remember what year? It was about 25. 1945. And

32:12.706 --> 32:23.157
the last time I saw him was probably about 1914, 
before that. And in 1925, I went in there and we had a

32:24.740 --> 32:35.370
nice boat session with the old colonel. He was a 
colonel by that time. And he was the highest

32:37.792 --> 32:46.260
ranking American officer captured in World War I. 
I'll be darned. And I run into, I said I operated the

32:46.841 --> 32:53.127
Bibian, the tavern dealer there for a while. And I 
met an old boy, World War I boy, and he had quite an

32:53.748 --> 33:00.554
experience. He was with the...

33:08.642 --> 33:10.583
I thought I'd remember his division. And he and his 
colonel got along very well. He said, you know, he

33:17.810 --> 33:21.173
was telling me about his colonel, how well... how 
well his colonel thought of him, that he could get

33:22.520 --> 33:33.534
anything he wanted out of his colonel, because the 
colonel said I was the best army sergeant he'd ever

33:22.520 --> 33:33.534
had. And he said, I can't think of his name, but you 
know he was the highest American army officer,

33:35.516 --> 33:43.806
kept you doing well going? And I said, you don't 
know his name? I said, I know him very well. He said,

33:48.743 --> 33:52.309
what do you know about him? He said, you wasn't in 
our outfit. I said, no, but I know the guy you're

33:55.073 --> 33:58.578
talking about. And I said, not much, his name was 
Levi G. Brown. He said, that's what it was.

34:06.912 --> 34:10.397
Now, you were involved in a very interesting 
incident involving the branding of the Texas

34:10.765 --> 34:13.829
Longhorn. Could you tell us how that took place 
leading up to that? Who was involved and how y'all

34:17.355 --> 34:19.638
went about it? Well, I'll tell you, one of the 
things that promoted it, did you ever, you heard of

34:20.219 --> 34:33.258
the incident at the time when they got Rice's Owl, 
did you? No, I don't have it. Well, that happened

34:35.082 --> 34:36.804
just before that. The basketball team went down to 
play Rice, and they played that. In those days, you

34:43.574 --> 34:49.963
know, you had very limited facilities. And Rice 
did not have a gym. And we just had a makeshift gym.

34:59.616 --> 35:02.440
And they played in the YMCA gym downtown.

35:05.761 --> 35:07.043
And Rice comes down. Do they still have that old 
stuffed owl? I believe so. They used to have a

35:12.251 --> 35:13.733
stuffed owl. It was about a six-foot deal. Painted 
up, you know, like an owl. And that was their

35:19.662 --> 35:21.665
mascot. And they'd bring it out to all their 
athletic contests and set it on the sideline. And

35:26.453 --> 35:28.796
they brought it down there for that basketball 
game. And when the game was over, where they

35:33.638 --> 35:37.603
carelessly left that owl sat in there somewhere. 
And that A&M basketball team, when they got

35:38.604 --> 35:51.760
through dressing and cleaning up, and they come 
out and they saw that owl sat in there, they

35:38.604 --> 35:51.760
thought, well, I think we'll just take him back to 
college with us. They just picked it up, brought it

35:52.281 --> 36:01.452
down there, and put it in the express car.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.661
brought it on up to College Station. Well, they had 
a lot of fun with it around a couple of days. They

36:08.205 --> 36:10.087
paraded that aisle around there. Brazell was 
president at that time, and they brought it over

36:11.129 --> 36:18.157
there to Brazell's residence. He'd come out and 
had his picture made with it. They published it in

36:21.041 --> 36:31.253
the Houston papers, and it got them Ross aisle boys 
kind of stirred up, and they made a deal with a

36:21.041 --> 36:31.253
private eye to come up and And so I surveyed the deal 
and find out where we kept the owl and what was done

36:32.465 --> 36:39.632
with it. And he come up there and posed as

36:39.652 --> 36:48.221
a sports writer for one of the newspapers. And

36:49.782 --> 36:59.012
the boys, the basketball players or whoever it 
was, took him up. We kept him up in the arm. He was up

37:00.333 --> 37:02.235
on the fourth floor. main building of the old or it 
was of course a new main building at that time. So

37:09.762 --> 37:27.360
they took him up there and showed him why the aisle 
and and brought him out and he made some pictures of

37:09.762 --> 37:27.360
it and that night he after he got through he said I'm 
going to write you all boys up a good story on this

37:09.762 --> 37:27.360
deal. He wired down to those rice cadets that had it 
all spotted up for them to come up that night. They

37:33.812 --> 37:37.117
came up in a car. And they came up there right around 
midnight. And they went up there and broke into the

37:42.264 --> 37:44.427
armory. And the night watchman discovered the 
deal and fired off a volley of shots or something.

37:56.904 --> 37:59.307
And it was right around 12 o'clock at night. And 
boy, everybody tumbled out of bed in just no time at

37:59.962 --> 38:06.530
all. The word got around that a bunch of rice cadets 
came up and got that owl out of the army. And just

38:18.004 --> 38:29.277
about that time, one of them

38:18.004 --> 38:29.277
passenger trains was going south, and everybody 
tore off for the depot. I went down and just

38:29.527 --> 38:42.359
commandeered that train and about two or three 
hundred cadets, at least two or three hundred

38:29.527 --> 38:42.359
cadets swarmed on top of that thing and told them to 
take off and went on down the road toward Dunn.

38:42.379 --> 38:45.902
What's the name of that town just south of College? 
Hempstead? No, no, a little closer. Just south of

38:49.906 --> 38:51.347
College Station there. About 20. Welborn? About 
20 miles south of it. Pretty concise town at that

39:00.172 --> 39:03.076
time. Well, anyhow, they didn't get very far. I 
wasn't on the deal. But they didn't get very far.

39:11.408 --> 39:22.745
And right in those days, just what they called a 
highway was just a little old dirt road running

39:11.408 --> 39:22.745
along the railroad track. There they saw them. Saw 
those rice hounds with that with that owl in the

39:29.180 --> 39:34.688
cart. And they run on about a half a mile and pull 
that string and stop the train. Everybody went

39:42.759 --> 39:48.447
out, towed a barricade across

39:42.759 --> 39:48.447
the road. And towed, and run those cadets all over 
that Bradford's Bottom down there. They finally

39:57.540 --> 39:58.782
picked them all up. turned their car around just 
before they picked him up while the Rice Isles,

40:00.061 --> 40:14.319
those Rice Isles set fire to their mascot and 
burned him up.

40:14.339 --> 40:28.296
They brought him back up to College Station and 
walked him around there for about two days until,

40:14.339 --> 40:28.296
and then the president of Rice called Dr. Bezell 
and said, There's enough of that horseplay going

40:29.440 --> 40:38.349
around to have those harassed students turned 
loose and let them come back and go to school. Well,

40:39.610 --> 40:43.494
old Doc Giselle complied with the request. He 
turned them loose. But that sports writer, he was

40:46.498 --> 40:52.283
in a bad way. They finally found out who he was, that 
he was a private eye, and they brought him back. And

40:59.360 --> 41:05.987
they turned him over to the fish, and them fish 
really mistreated him, something terrible. They

41:06.007 --> 41:12.013
walked him around, just walked him around, and 
just kept threatening him all the time. And he was

41:13.495 --> 41:17.018
just pleading all the time for his life. He thought 
he was going to get killed. And they finally told

41:19.861 --> 41:24.606
him, said, we're going to turn you loose. Some of 
the upperclassmen told them to turn him loose. And

41:29.262 --> 41:34.147
they took him out on the parade ground, and it was a 
cold night. It was freezing or better. Took him out

41:38.292 --> 41:56.431
there on the parade ground at midnight, undressed 
him, took all his clothes off, gave him his shoes,

41:38.292 --> 41:56.431
and said, all right, go on to Houston

41:38.292 --> 41:56.431
if you

41:38.292 --> 41:56.431
want to. And that's what And that's what led us up to 
the, we kind of got it into our system, you know,

41:57.916 --> 42:04.565
about playing pranks. And

42:06.247 --> 42:18.263
Texas University was getting a lot of publicity 
about their

42:06.247 --> 42:18.263
mascot. They didn't have any name for him. They 
didn't have any name. No, up to that time they had no

42:21.467 --> 42:26.674
name, but he was a marvelous specimen of a 
lawnmower. of a big, raw, just a big-boned, mean

42:27.228 --> 42:33.675
outlaw. I've had the experience with them. I spent 
all my boyhood on a ranch, and I know what they are.

42:45.909 --> 42:56.121
When they brought them out for a football game, 
they had four men on horseback with ropes on them in

42:45.909 --> 42:56.121
every direction. one on each side, and they'd lead 
him up and down the football field because, I mean,

42:57.181 --> 43:06.334
one rope, he'd take after him. You had to have him 
tied from every direction to take care of him. And

43:12.202 --> 43:23.779
they was putting on all this big deal about, they 
have a sort of a homecoming or the letterman, on

43:24.569 --> 43:27.773
Texas Independence Day. And they had

43:28.754 --> 43:45.413
won that game that year by a score of, I think it was 
20 to three or some such score as that.

43:47.535 --> 43:53.462
Just the year before that, we beat Texas 13 to 
nothing. And you know Texas and A&M quit playing

43:57.281 --> 44:02.686
football there for a period of time. You've heard 
the name Charlie Moran. Well Charlie Moran was a

44:07.171 --> 44:19.684
guy that brought, he brought in the recruiting 
idea really into Texas schools. Charlie was an old

44:19.784 --> 44:21.225
pro. He was a pro football player and a pro baseball 
player, and of course he had played college

44:24.442 --> 44:31.454
football as a youngster. But when he came to A&M, it 
was just at the time when,

44:32.896 --> 44:49.825
right shortly after the Congress had suspended 
athletics all athletics at Carlisle University

44:50.446 --> 44:58.858
in Pennsylvania, that old Indian school, the one 
that Jim Thorpe went to. Well, there were a bunch of

45:00.040 --> 45:12.859
pretty good football players on the loose around 
that, and Charlie got hold of about three of them,

45:00.040 --> 45:12.859
of the old Carlisle football players.

45:16.404 --> 45:18.006
And he brought in several others. He had quite a 
football player brought in from Alabama, and he

45:19.218 --> 45:29.311
got one out of Colorado, Lyman. 200-pound men in 
those days was unusual, and these were around 225,

45:30.993 --> 45:39.565
230-pound

45:30.993 --> 45:39.565
boys. Could we stop just a minute and let me turn my 
tape over? I'm running out on this side. Okay.

45:44.992 --> 45:45.192
Thank you.
