WEBVTT

00:03.507 --> 00:10.974
And I chuckle at, they won't know, some of them, Vet 
Village? What was that? And, of course, it'll take

00:13.876 --> 00:21.583
them a good many weeks to learn the old Aggie lingo. 
Screamin' Owl? Screamin' Owl Nelson? Notes

00:26.948 --> 00:27.909
Nance? Jock Woods? Dr. Nance, that's the one I was 
thinking of, Dr. Nance. I enjoyed his poetry. But

00:34.237 --> 00:44.810
the activity of the vets in the campus life, they 
were well integrated into it. And the Student Life

00:44.990 --> 00:50.396
Committee, which at that time was, I think, the big 
committee of students. That was kind of the

00:50.436 --> 00:53.220
ultimate committee. They were well represented 
on that. And there was no effort by the veterans to

00:55.583 --> 01:01.169
politically dominate student life? No, I don't 
think so. No more so than the Corps. There was not a

01:08.258 --> 01:16.771
veteran organization candidate for student body 
president or anything like that? If there was, I

01:16.891 --> 01:18.533
don't remember it. I've never heard of it. Again, 
the relationships were remarkably good. Then you

01:25.824 --> 01:33.015
go back as a sophomore, and when do you decide to go 
over and join the Corps? I hate to say this, but one

01:34.008 --> 01:39.695
of the main motivations was the money. Because you 
got paid on the contract. So I decided, and by this

01:41.517 --> 01:45.982
time, I'd been around it enough that I liked it. 
Just going back to that point I made earlier, in the

01:46.322 --> 01:52.950
Navy, the camaraderie on board ship and that sort 
of thing. And I could see that the guys in the Corps

01:53.251 --> 01:59.278
kind of had a thing going that we didn't. And I'm not 
being married, but I thought, this is a good thing,

01:59.298 --> 02:03.863
and I'll get paid for it in science. And so I just 
decided to go to the Corps. When did you do it? I had

02:08.310 --> 02:14.859
between my sophomore and junior year because I 
started out on a contract basis. Do you remember

02:14.879 --> 02:19.766
what the financial reward was? I want to say like 
$45 a month or something like that. Of course, it

02:23.651 --> 02:26.535
was for uniforms, which took care of the clothing 
problem. You didn't have to buy clothing. And then

02:28.938 --> 02:32.162
I went into a veteran outfit. And a lot of us, you 
know, they had two or three companies of veterans.

02:39.761 --> 02:42.425
And so we didn't hassle one another. Did y'all get a 
nickname, your outfit? No, I started out as B-Vets

02:46.089 --> 02:49.313
is all it was. We didn't have all those. I don't 
think they have all those names like they do now.

02:52.657 --> 02:54.559
And it was Army? It was Army ROTC, yep. That's what I 
meant, not Army Air Corps. No, I don't recall an Air

02:58.144 --> 03:01.828
Force. What separate unit? What dormitory? It was 
the one, 12. I think it was 12. Is that the last one

03:07.954 --> 03:09.555
up? Down at Duncan. Yeah, right across from 
Duncan. Describe how a, is a junior, a frog? Well,

03:18.664 --> 03:19.385
yeah. A transfer? A transfer. But that office, we 
didn't do all this hassling around. So even the

03:25.231 --> 03:27.633
freshmen in your outfit were veterans?

03:30.376 --> 03:31.697
I'm not sure we had any freshmen. I think we were all 
probably juniors. I don't recall any freshman

03:36.721 --> 03:40.487
veterans. Did you all get underclassmen to do the 
chores for you? No, we didn't do that. Really? No,

03:46.697 --> 03:49.561
that was not something we did. We didn't have any 
underclassmen in there. I never thought about

03:52.085 --> 03:54.249
that, but we didn't have any freshmen. Were you all 
fully accepted by the civilian part of the Corps?

03:59.825 --> 04:01.146
Yeah, I think so. I think they kind of didn't like it 
that we didn't do some of the hassling around that

04:01.166 --> 04:13.097
they did, but it never got any kind of a problem at 
all. In the dining hall, did you all not have then at

04:13.117 --> 04:22.245
your table the kind of routine where the freshmen 
served everybody, every upperclassman? No, no,

04:22.265 --> 04:23.467
we didn't have that. We were very democratic. On 
dining hall, I think

04:27.449 --> 04:33.098
it was pretty good, really. We didn't, of course, 
didn't have any choice. There were no cafeteria

04:35.642 --> 04:38.326
lines, anything like that. We took what they 
served us, and we had, of course, every table had

04:38.646 --> 04:46.158
its waiter, and they were paid waiters. You know, 
the guys had a job. That was the head waiter job, and

04:48.641 --> 04:52.207
that was Bert Reyes, as I remember, was our head 
waiter. That was a good job. That was a plum job. But

04:56.744 --> 05:01.291
I think the food was, I don't remember many 
complaints about it. Did you all become part of the

05:01.311 --> 05:06.378
routine of the nicknames for the food? Oh, yeah. 
Oh, yeah. We took all that on, yeah. What were your

05:11.286 --> 05:13.289
favorite food? Oh, I don't remember any favorite 
food. I just remember it was pretty good. You know,

05:17.175 --> 05:22.202
it was certainly as good as the food we got in the 
Army or the Navy. Was there plenty of it? Oh, yeah.

05:24.386 --> 05:24.486
Yeah. We got, never one hundred. and described 
then a, once you're over in the Corps, go through a

05:26.697 --> 05:33.728
typical day. When did it start and how and when did 
it end? Well, of course, we had the regular drills

05:36.933 --> 05:49.133
and things that anybody had, but there was, I guess 
I would have to say that we did not have the hassle

05:36.933 --> 05:49.133
that the regular units did. But that didn't seem 
to... create any kind of cleavage between their

05:52.043 --> 05:57.972
operation, their living, and ours. We mixed 
together,

05:58.813 --> 06:09.849
but as far as the routine, it was just like the 
regular military units did then, except we didn't

05:58.813 --> 06:09.849
have freshmen and sophomores. But you all marched 
into trial? Yes. And had a early morning

06:12.985 --> 06:18.310
inspection. You fell out for an inspection. Yeah, 
but I don't recall too much of that. Maybe there's

06:23.175 --> 06:25.337
more of that now than there was then. Then in the 
afternoons, did you all drill? We drilled. We went

06:31.764 --> 06:34.907
through the whole ROTC routine. Were there 
demerits when people walked the bull run? I don't

06:40.846 --> 06:50.498
recall that in our outfit, but again, we're all 
veterans, we're juniors, we're seniors, we

06:40.846 --> 06:50.498
didn't hassle one another like that. And no one 
came in and made up your bed, you didn't? Oh no, I

06:53.222 --> 06:54.704
didn't make my own bed. And I see that we were in that 
dorm, that was an all-vent dorm, the second,

06:55.365 --> 07:01.052
third, and fourth floors. The bottom floor was the 
commandant and the colonel of the corps and his

07:02.293 --> 07:07.580
staff. And then in my I

07:10.816 --> 07:20.545
was

07:10.816 --> 07:20.545
on the corps staff, so I moved down. During your 
junior year, did you begin to realize that you were

07:22.767 --> 07:38.562
making progress in moving up in the corps status 
toward being one of the officers?

07:40.077 --> 07:42.079
Not really much during my junior. I knew by this 
time, I knew I was going to be the editor of the

07:42.219 --> 07:46.884
battalion the next year. And we had two editors. We 
had one for the corps and one for the inaugural. And

07:52.509 --> 07:54.191
I was going to be the corps editor. So I knew I'd move 
down to the corps staff. Who made that choice? Who

07:58.855 --> 08:00.136
made what choice? The selected Jews editor. How 
was that done? Really, Roland Bing did that. There

08:06.031 --> 08:13.961
weren't that many guys who were willing to put in 
the time that I did and my co-editor did. He was a guy

08:15.363 --> 08:20.530
named Bill Billingsley, and he was a superb 
writer. He was a gifted writer.

08:26.237 --> 08:32.065
So on the masthead, where the staff was listed, 
were the two editors listed equally? Yes. And what

08:33.841 --> 08:35.923
title were y'all given? Co-editor. Co-editor. 
And did it say veteran? No, but everybody knew. Oh.

08:43.490 --> 08:45.953
And how did y'all divide up the workload? On the 
battalion? There really was never any written

08:48.515 --> 08:51.478
rule. We just would sit down together. And we had a 
pretty good staff of guys. And we would sign the

08:56.783 --> 08:58.705
things out. And it was a very collegial sort of 
thing. We just had worked together for a couple

09:04.013 --> 09:10.983
years, and we knew what each one could do and who 
could do what best. It went very well. Were you ever

09:14.588 --> 09:18.233
aware of secret fraternities? Yes. What can you 
say about that? I was a member of one. You were? Yes.

09:24.462 --> 09:26.665
You're the second one that has admitted them. Is 
that right? Are you at liberty to say which one? I

09:29.950 --> 09:30.691
didn't know. I guess there weren't any. I'm trying 
to think of the name of the thing. I don't recall.

09:36.738 --> 09:37.679
Yeah, there were two. T.T.'s? T.T. That was the one 
I was in. And the stickers, the swastikas. Okay, I

09:45.326 --> 09:47.969
guess that was the other one. I don't remember that 
name, but stickers does sound familiar. I didn't

09:52.733 --> 09:55.316
know it was swastikas, but stickers does sound 
familiar. But yeah, I went into one of those when I

09:55.336 --> 09:59.740
was a junior, I guess. How many people were in it?

10:06.215 --> 10:11.461
Gosh, maybe 30 or 35, somewhere around there. 
Where did you have meetings? Miss Maggie's. Don't

10:16.087 --> 10:17.028
know Miss Maggie's? No, this is down in Bryant. She 
was a... Was that the boarding house? It was a

10:24.117 --> 10:25.879
boarding house, yeah. All-you-can-eat kind of 
place? Well, no. No, I don't think... She would

10:28.422 --> 10:34.990
have people in, but I don't think it was a boarding 
house. I'm not real sure what the parentage of the

10:35.948 --> 10:48.042
thing was, but she apparently had been, if you can 
use the term loosely, the house mother of this

10:35.948 --> 10:48.042
group for a number of years. And I guess that maybe 
we're about 30 of us. And how often did you all get

10:52.468 --> 10:54.150
together? Not very often. Once a week? I don't 
think it was that often. I'm really kind of hazy on

11:01.438 --> 11:02.800
it. But we had to be real careful because, boy, that 
was an announcement to the loaners. And were there

11:09.110 --> 11:12.194
people from every year? No, I think they were 
mostly juniors and seniors. Did you apply? No, so

11:20.303 --> 11:22.366
you were asked. And I don't even remember who asked 
me to tell the truth. We had to be so careful because

11:27.772 --> 11:31.116
they threw you out of school. And what was the 
purpose of the organization? Oh, it was just a

11:33.712 --> 11:36.695
secret organization. We didn't do anything. It 
was just kind of special good friends type thing,

11:38.498 --> 11:43.804
like fraternity. Okay, I had wondered, was one of 
the purposes to help keep campus student

11:44.084 --> 11:52.895
leadership within that group? No, it wasn't. 
There was no overt effort. But a number of the guys

11:56.719 --> 12:00.664
who were in it were the student leaders. but not 
because they were in it, they became, they got in it

12:01.522 --> 12:06.547
because they were students. Alright, in your own 
face, did you become, the fact that you were part of

12:06.567 --> 12:13.374
that group didn't help you become the head of the 
back? Oh no, it had absolutely nothing to do with

12:13.394 --> 12:15.536
it. In fact, I probably became part of the group 
because I was head of the back. And my roommate, who

12:20.161 --> 12:28.069
was Corps Commander, we had at least one 
yellow-headed.

12:29.703 --> 12:40.758
And

12:29.703 --> 12:40.758
I presume never, never, never was there any 
mention in the battalion. Oh, no. Did the

12:44.263 --> 12:46.766
administration ever try to do anything? They were 
very much interested in it, but they never could

12:46.806 --> 12:52.474
find out much about it. Although there was one 
member, I guess it's safe to say that now, Colonel

12:52.494 --> 12:59.203
Joe Davis had been a member of it. But those guys 
never took a part in it as students. And it never, we

13:05.811 --> 13:09.555
never tried to influence anything. You became a 
member of that because you were something else.

13:12.718 --> 13:14.120
We're back, but we're going out again. We don't 
want to bother you. Okay. All right. As far as I,

13:17.043 --> 13:21.007
well, I shouldn't say as I know. That's too strong. 
I think that Sterling Evans was also a member of

13:22.529 --> 13:28.515
that secret organization. He's the class of 21. 
Exactly. I know it had been around a long time. And I

13:34.538 --> 13:38.624
believe Dr. Harrington later tried to wipe them 
out. Oh, yeah. He was very much opposed to it.

13:42.189 --> 13:45.113
Nobody that wasn't in it liked it. Was there any 
kind of initiation that you remember?

13:54.346 --> 13:55.527
I can't remember. Was there any kind of symbol that 
y'all wore? No. Handshakes? There was a

14:01.427 --> 14:03.089
handshake. Kind of a double grip sort of thing. Was 
there a magic word or phrase? No, no. There was the

14:08.618 --> 14:09.619
handshake. But the more I had thought about this, 
but I'm absolutely convinced that you were in it,

14:11.302 --> 14:27.426
you were invited in it because of what you were and 
you didn't get to be what you were because you were

14:11.302 --> 14:27.426
in it. But it was really frowned on because it 
smacked of a fraternity. And there had never been,

14:34.385 --> 14:40.373
were there ever any reunions after graduation? 
Well, not that I know of. Because, you know, I went

14:42.436 --> 14:44.218
to meetings in Harvard. But I think, I'm trying to 
think, Bob Burnham had something to do with it. I

14:54.491 --> 14:55.893
can't remember what. Let's see, Campus 
Characters. Was Pinky there then? Pinky was

14:59.189 --> 15:00.030
there, yeah. What was Pinky doing there? What 
Pinky always did. He was

15:04.458 --> 15:11.489
the booster without limits. Where did he live? No, 
I think he lived off campus. I'm not sure of that.

15:16.818 --> 15:17.800
Describe Pinky. Make believe I'd never seen him. 
You've never seen him? No, make believe I have.

15:22.267 --> 15:23.029
Make believe you've never seen him? He was a... 
rather frail or fragile looking man, almost

15:25.000 --> 15:43.206
hyperactive, I would say, and would talk A&M at the 
drop of a hat to anybody who would listen. And he

15:43.226 --> 15:54.282
loved to tell the story of how he claimed 
responsibility for giving A&M

15:54.886 --> 15:58.971
a hook into the permanent university program. 
Now, whether that was true or not, I don't know. I

16:02.274 --> 16:06.820
want to say that he claimed to have been a member of 
the board of directors at one time, but... He was.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.423
He was a board member back in the 20s. Okay, well 
then, that's the origin of that claim. I have no

16:13.687 --> 16:19.995
reason to doubt it, but he was an A&M... Did you all 
see him much? Oh, yeah. He was around campus all the

16:20.816 --> 16:22.918
time, yes. The only one who was as vocal as Pinky was 
Lupo, but Pinky had some... That's the next man.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.163
Who was this O'Reilly Lou? O'Reilly Lou was a guy, I 
guess he graduated, but he never left the campus,

16:36.243 --> 16:44.454
except to move across the street and open his 
store. He was one of those guys that college is the

16:44.474 --> 16:50.001
highlight of his life. Less so with Pinky, 
although you could say that, but Pinky He had to

16:54.083 --> 16:57.486
have been something or he wouldn't have gotten on 
the Board of Regents. But Lupo never got beyond the

16:57.526 --> 17:00.229
store. Did you and your buddies buy things from 
there? From Lupo? Oh, yeah. See, there weren't

17:04.152 --> 17:05.513
that many stores. I think his maybe was the only 
bookstore. And did you or anybody there that you

17:08.997 --> 17:13.601
knew ever borrow money from him? I never borrowed 
money, but a lot of guys did. When McQuillan would

17:15.903 --> 17:19.186
run out, you could go to Lupo. But everybody knew 
when you borrowed from Lupo. He loved to put sorts

17:22.269 --> 17:23.770
in. He had a ski one time that he was going to. He 
thought there needed to be bicycles around the

17:26.529 --> 17:28.971
campus. You may have heard this story. And so he 
bought a lot of used bicycles. And I think it was, I

17:33.536 --> 17:36.239
don't remember, he had them painted yellow or 
something like that. And the idea was if you saw one

17:36.259 --> 17:40.684
of those bicycles, you could take it and go 
somewhere. But I know they all disappeared pretty

17:40.704 --> 17:44.708
quickly.

17:45.870 --> 17:49.253
You're in the Corps as a junior. And then as the year 
progresses, you are going to become you've become

17:53.315 --> 18:22.613
a member of core staff and was that directly 
related to being the editor of the back yes that was

17:53.315 --> 18:22.613
a core information option to go back to something 
you asked about the initiation into the tts i don't

17:53.315 --> 18:22.613
think there was i was trying to think of initiation 
there was initiation in the ross volunteers oh oh

17:53.315 --> 18:22.613
now i know very little about that i'd be 
appreciated that you were sharing everything you

18:22.897 --> 18:27.002
can remember about the RVs. Well, it was a good 
organization. It was an honor guard, just like it

18:28.924 --> 18:30.606
is now. And I think it was only juniors and seniors. 
I guess maybe that's still true. Only juniors and

18:36.413 --> 18:38.015
seniors. I don't remember how you were tapped for 
it, but there was a pretty heavy initiation into

18:38.035 --> 18:47.006
that. How did you learn you had been selected? I had 
the slightest recollection of learning Did you

18:53.305 --> 18:54.346
apply? I don't think you applied. I think you were 
probably the military combat or PMS&T staff

18:55.507 --> 19:02.575
probably decided who should be in. And that was at 
the end of your junior year? No, because I was in it

19:07.541 --> 19:08.962
two years. So I must have gone in. What kind of way? I 
can't remember. Because I was just in the Corps two

19:15.049 --> 19:16.630
years. But I think I was... I think I was in the RVs 
two years. Maybe not. Maybe I was just in the RVs one

19:22.834 --> 19:25.197
year. I don't remember. The uniform, the RV 
uniform? Just like it is now. I don't know. I don't

19:31.204 --> 19:34.027
think they had quite the sashes that I think they 
had. It was the whites. And about how many?

19:39.173 --> 19:39.334
Hang on. I'm going to back up. I was in a junior year, 
because I remember I had a picture one time. I'd

19:44.580 --> 19:49.806
gone to a big dance on campus, and I was a junior, and 
I was in my whites. I don't know how I got in it, but I

19:50.427 --> 19:55.715
liked that. And do you remember how much those 
lights cost? I don't know where I got the money to do

20:01.284 --> 20:08.416
it either, but I got them. And what variety of 
activities were the RVs officially part of? I'm

20:13.985 --> 20:19.872
going to say that they're pretty much like they are 
now, just an honor guard for things. I don't

20:19.952 --> 20:26.139
remember anybody coming to campus where we had a 
formation at that time. They brought us down one

20:27.420 --> 20:31.084
time to march in the Fiesta Parade down in San 
Antonio. We thought we were coming down to be

20:31.705 --> 20:37.852
escorts for some of the duchesses, and it turned 
out they just wanted us to stand around looking

20:31.705 --> 20:37.852
good. We were all disgusted. But again, that was 
the hitchhiking Yeah, we were still hitchhiking.

20:44.484 --> 20:55.237
I remember my dad and mother lived in a little house 
over by Jefferson High School, and five of us spent

20:44.484 --> 20:55.237
the night there and laid across the double bed. So, 
are these hitchhiked? Oh, yeah. Oh, sure. And you

20:59.802 --> 21:01.644
had your uniform all folded up? Well, hanging on a 
hanger. But did you carry it hanging? Yeah. Oh,

21:07.010 --> 21:07.370
really? Oh, yeah. Now, a lot of times, when I say a 
lot of times... Some of the guys had cars, you know,

21:10.921 --> 21:16.766
and of course, fill up the cars. During the, the, 
did y'all ever escort, was there a gubernatorial

21:16.786 --> 21:25.414
inaugural during? I don't remember, I don't 
remember it, no. So, you don't remember any big

21:30.579 --> 21:34.483
celebrity occasion? No. It may be that, you know, 
that's 50 years ago. I could have forgotten one. I

21:39.659 --> 21:40.981
hear you. Let's see. A court trip as a junior and 
senior. Describe that. Well, again, we

21:48.170 --> 21:53.757
hitchhiked, or if you're lucky enough to have a 
friend who had a car, you could ride with them. They

21:55.079 --> 21:56.440
were great fun. They had midnight yell practices. 
You almost always had a date. I loved the marching.

22:04.731 --> 22:07.995
I remember marching in Waco, Austin, I don't 
remember marching. Yeah, I marched once in Fort

22:10.534 --> 22:12.255
Worth, I think. Houston. I don't remember 
marching in Houston. We may have, but I don't

22:16.279 --> 22:18.240
recall. And how did the crowds in those cities 
react? Oh, they loved us. Yeah, it was a big deal.

22:25.607 --> 22:28.169
Never any problems, except midnight yell 
practice. Got out of hand a couple times. Such as?

22:33.274 --> 22:38.218
Yeah, a little too much drinking, and you always 
have the fringe element. cause ruckus, nothing

22:38.401 --> 22:41.425
real serious. Now, normally for a court trip, did 
you leave College Station Saturday morning? No,

22:46.711 --> 22:47.792
you had to leave Friday. No, we had to leave Friday. 
Friday. Or Thursday.

22:57.163 --> 23:02.249
Were there any football games during those four 
years that you remember as being special? Yes. I

23:03.110 --> 23:07.395
remember when we played Texas in Boston, and we 
tied. and I think it was 14-14, and Ray Whitaker

23:08.725 --> 23:16.534
caught a pass, and I remember that distinctly. It 
was, I think, the first, someone says the first

23:16.554 --> 23:20.098
time we'd ever crossed their goal line. I'm not 
sure that was true. I think it was the first time

23:21.760 --> 23:28.247
Texas had not won at home against the Aggies for 
many, many years. And it was an exciting game. That

23:31.610 --> 23:34.293
one stands out. And do you remember any pranks 
during an Aggie football game?

23:42.121 --> 23:47.907
Well, of course, the story of Red Duke and going up 
and kidnapping the Baylor Bear. Yeah, just put

23:48.407 --> 23:49.629
that on tape. Yeah, well, this was really 
secondhand, but Red was the yelliger, and Red was

23:49.649 --> 23:56.095
from Hillsboro. And Red and I roomed together one 
summer. That was an experience in itself.

24:02.682 --> 24:02.842
Oh. Let's describe that. Describe Red as a 
roommate. Well, you have to know Red, really. He's

24:09.469 --> 24:10.390
a... He's a great guy. He'd do anything for you. But 
it's like living with, let's see, what could I

24:15.478 --> 24:25.453
compare

24:15.478 --> 24:25.453
it to? There is no comparison. Lots of energy. Oh, 
absolute energy. Totally unpredictable. Sense

24:32.123 --> 24:33.526
of humor. Good sense of humor. People were always 
coming in and calling on him. He was not the tidiest

24:39.445 --> 24:43.089
roommate in the world, to say the least. And he did 
his own thing. What was his major? He was a business

24:49.677 --> 24:51.179
major. One time, as I remember the story, he went up 
and sold a pound of blood to get some money to go on a

24:53.182 --> 24:59.830
date or something. I don't know when that was. But 
then one time he got in his daddy's brand new car and

25:01.472 --> 25:08.440
he rolled it and it came out without a scratch. He 
was always into activities.

25:17.323 --> 25:18.524
Did he make high grades? Average grades. Average. 
Average. Talking about Red Duke. Oh, thank you.

25:25.614 --> 25:25.954
Thank you. Did you tell my story on Red? About the 
plant garden? Mm-hmm. I just was telling you. He

25:32.483 --> 25:35.807
did that for a girlfriend he was going to give a 
birthday present to. Is that what it was? He didn't

25:36.989 --> 25:37.870
have the money. when he was in high school and 
somebody sold him blood. Oh, my goodness. Yeah, at

25:45.427 --> 25:49.093
that time, what was his ambition? What did y'all 
think he was going to do fresh on? I don't think he

25:52.119 --> 25:56.427
knew or I don't think he had any idea of being a 
doctor. He just wanted to graduate. And, of

25:58.892 --> 26:02.659
course, when the war started, he went to Germany, 
as I remember. And he was already red. I mean, that

26:05.125 --> 26:06.967
was his nickname. Oh, yes. Was he a popular guy? 
Very popular.

26:13.376 --> 26:16.220
Describe the bear capture. Well, he and I don't 
know who went up to Waco to get the bear. And they

26:21.146 --> 26:23.850
apparently didn't have any trouble getting the 
bear itself. They put it in the car.

26:26.634 --> 26:30.739
Unfortunately, the bear got mad, and he just tore 
up the upholstery. caribou tore it up, just ruined

26:31.141 --> 26:33.905
the car inside. And they didn't know what to do with 
it. They had this bear, but you heard of a bear by the

26:37.670 --> 26:41.094
tail? Well, that's what they had. And of course, 
they didn't want to hurt the bear. So they drove

26:45.560 --> 26:53.010
around a while, and they finally took it out and 
tied it up somewhere and called the Baylor campus

26:45.560 --> 26:53.010
security and said, if you want your bear, it's over 
here. And that's about as much as I know about this

26:54.573 --> 26:56.215
story. So they didn't get very far down the road 
with it. No, the bear was bigger than they were. Did

27:01.043 --> 27:06.148
Red and whomever was with him get into any trouble 
at A&M over that? No, I don't think so. I'm not sure

27:07.970 --> 27:10.333
they got caught to tell the truth. I've never heard 
of any problems like that. I don't think he got

27:13.116 --> 27:16.899
caught by anybody in authority. Of course, he 
worked around campus pretty fast. Alright, we're

27:21.144 --> 27:25.649
back now on campus. I'm looking at various A&M 
traditions. Do you by chance remember your first

27:30.811 --> 27:35.637
silver taps? I remember silver taps vividly, but 
which was the first one I don't remember. How did it

27:43.206 --> 27:45.549
touch you, the silver taps? I think

27:47.452 --> 27:59.046
it

27:47.452 --> 27:59.046
cemented the realization that this was more than 
just a group of students or a campus or a

27:59.684 --> 28:06.374
university. That there was a, again, the word I've 
used often is camaraderie. There was a bond that

28:11.863 --> 28:22.760
was bigger than just being in a school at a place at a 
time. Oh, that's a great song. In your student

28:26.853 --> 28:30.538
days, did the students take civil tap seriously? 
Yes, very seriously. I would hate to think it was

28:33.963 --> 28:37.568
not taken seriously. And where was it held? Down at 
the Sully statue.

28:45.780 --> 28:55.273
We didn't have, as I recall,

28:45.780 --> 28:55.273
the salute, the gun, the volley, the rifle volley. 
but we did have the

28:55.625 --> 29:00.670
viewers. Yeah. And lights were out. Oh yes. It was 
silent. It was silent, yeah. Your junior year, do

29:09.179 --> 29:13.604
you remember a final review? Oh yes, very much. 
Describe it.

29:21.812 --> 29:23.674
I think that the recollection that I would prize 
the most is that it made me glad that I had gone to the

29:24.464 --> 29:52.986
court because it was something special

29:24.464 --> 29:52.986
and I realized that if you weren't in the court you 
missed that it didn't mean you didn't get a lot of

29:24.464 --> 29:52.986
the A&M traditions and activities and quote 
fellowship But to me, the core will always be A&M.

29:58.757 --> 30:14.678
And if you're not in that, that's an element of that 
experience, that four-year experience, that

29:58.757 --> 30:14.678
you're never going

29:58.757 --> 30:14.678
to hate. The final review, that junior year, you 
had acquired some boots. Oh, yeah. Where'd you get

30:23.071 --> 30:24.813
them and how much they cost? What was it? Right. 
Okay. How much they cost? $75. Where'd you get that

30:31.440 --> 30:33.022
kind of boot? I don't know. That was a lot of money 
then, yeah. But I didn't buy a used pair. I bought a

30:39.529 --> 30:40.550
new pair of boots. And how did you feel when you put 
them on? I felt great. Did any special people come

30:44.375 --> 30:48.139
for a final review of that junior year? For you? I 
don't think so. I said earlier, and I don't know

30:52.332 --> 31:01.385
that my, my parents may have made one trip to India, 
maybe for Mother's Day. Mother's Day was a big

31:01.446 --> 31:02.808
deal. I don't know if it is now, but at that time, 
yes.
