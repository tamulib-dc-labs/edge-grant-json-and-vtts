WEBVTT

00:03.440 --> 00:20.773
One of the things I can think of is that we were 
trying to get a street maintenance program going,

00:03.440 --> 00:20.773
a renovation program, and I submitted it to Robert 
and never never could get it could get it going that

00:20.753 --> 00:38.712
and the the landscape rejuvenation program was 
another one that I think probably was landscape

00:20.753 --> 00:38.712
rejuvenation program I was trying I was trying to 
get some this was to Cargill I remember now because

00:20.753 --> 00:38.712
they'd come out with saying that you could use the 
available fund monies for this and that and all and

00:39.788 --> 00:59.670
so I'd been thinking about it and I sat down and 
wrote up a, I don't know, probably a four or five

00:39.788 --> 00:59.670
page squib on why I cited some specific examples of 
buildings and this kind of thing that we had to had

01:00.815 --> 01:05.985
to do as well as the irrigation stuff. We were 
getting to the point where a lot of our irrigation

01:06.025 --> 01:13.559
systems needed renovation and we needed to go to 
another control system. And one thing I might

01:13.579 --> 01:18.368
mention too that I'm kind of proud of, And as part of 
all this development, the irrigation systems got

01:20.305 --> 01:32.603
to mounting up, and we got to the point that we had 
more irrigation systems going than we could turn

01:20.305 --> 01:32.603
off when it rained. And Mike and I had talked about 
some way to handle it, and he'd looked into see if

01:33.905 --> 01:43.499
there were anything available, and there wasn't 
anything available readily on the market. And

01:44.020 --> 01:49.688
then one day, after one of our summers like this, 
and hired vessels coming into work, And he was

01:50.275 --> 01:55.543
coming around the North Durham area and the 
sprinklers were going and it was raining. And I got

01:56.745 --> 01:57.566
a call. And he said, cut the damn sprinklers off. 
And I said, we are, Mr. Vestal. It takes about four

02:02.854 --> 02:06.319
man days to cut just to switch the things off. He 
said, we need to fix that. And I said, we're working

02:08.542 --> 02:09.524
on it. So Goldwater and I got busy and we got to 
talking about it. And we were talking to Motorola

02:13.650 --> 02:18.477
at the time about a new radio system, two-way. And 
we got to talking to him a little bit more and and.

02:24.497 --> 02:26.899
And that's where Goldwater came in. I mean he he's 
got a real inquisitive mind. And the upshot was

02:31.344 --> 02:36.330
that Motorola had developed a switch. That they 
had installed on a number of residential hot water

02:37.632 --> 02:42.677
heaters. In Central Arkansas, some power grid or 
power company over there. And they did that, and

02:49.945 --> 02:56.540
they kept, they would switch hot water heaters 
randomly on and off, you know. And by doing that,

02:58.104 --> 03:00.970
they saved building a power plant. Okay. So we got 
to talking about, well, could we take something

03:02.514 --> 03:06.503
like that, and incorporated in our existing 
controllers and so we got to working with motorola

03:07.259 --> 03:23.648
folks and then got the toro folks came into it 
because they had what they call their golf course

03:07.259 --> 03:23.648
control system which was a bank of i think six big 
controllers Anyway, the upshot was we were able to

03:23.628 --> 03:42.092
take and modify our existing controllers and we 
designed a console and board that had

03:23.628 --> 03:42.092
36 switches. Yeah. And I had 30 switches because we 
got a radio system that was a non-voice control

03:44.484 --> 03:58.663
system and that would generate 30 coded tones. And 
so the upshot was we would put a tone read and some

03:58.981 --> 04:12.044
relays in our existing, we did all this in-house in 
our existing controllers, and then a radio switch

03:58.981 --> 04:12.044
up on that thing. And we could control, we got to the 
point where we could, we had six master clocks, and

04:12.064 --> 04:22.542
we could, by a series of switches, we could control 
switch it to one clock or another, switch it off or

04:22.522 --> 04:51.786
whatever, and we got to the point where we could 
turn everything on remotely by radio, and if,

04:22.522 --> 04:51.786
let's say, and we put what we called a black box in 
the physical plant radio room, so that if there was

04:22.522 --> 04:51.786
a fire or something of that nature, they could flip 
a switch and in 30 seconds, all the extraneous

04:22.522 --> 04:51.786
water was off. And we had to use that when Penn State 
came to play here because lightning knocked out

04:51.766 --> 04:59.476
every well in the well field. And all the water we 
had was in the tower. But, and that ultimately

05:04.742 --> 05:12.432
became, Motorola and Total kept doing that, and 
they've now got one that has feedback. I mean, it's

05:12.492 --> 05:14.194
got all kinds of bells and whistles. But that's 
where all that got started. And ours was getting

05:16.697 --> 05:19.581
kind of old. We were trying to upgrade upgrade that 
to you know much much better level but uh and we had

05:21.803 --> 05:50.376
it tied into a rain stat that we could set it for a 
quarter half an inch and it would shut everything

05:21.803 --> 05:50.376
down automatically and that solved howard's 
problem in comparison to the campus proper now i'm

05:21.803 --> 05:50.376
not talking about the ag experiment fields about 
what percentage of the water usage as far as you

05:21.803 --> 05:50.376
know during those years was used in grounds 
maintenance? How much water was used in flower

05:54.944 --> 05:58.790
beds and grass and trees? I think it was... 
Compared to the rest of the campus usage? Probably

06:05.199 --> 06:14.473
about 40 percent, because I think, no about 30 
percent, because I think we figured one time on on

06:14.943 --> 06:23.315
all of our tap valves and what it would run, and we 
were using about a million gallons to a million and

06:14.943 --> 06:23.315
a half gallons every time we watered.

06:26.400 --> 06:34.892
How could we have done campus planning better from 
the landscape, from the grounds maintenance?

06:36.863 --> 06:46.234
It would have been, I think, better if there had 
been some more long-range stuff done so that you

06:36.863 --> 06:46.234
had, because so many of the master plans. Now, the 
West Campus came about pretty good because

06:47.215 --> 06:52.260
Strickland-Rollins did a master plan. That was 
followed reasonably well. But most of the other

06:55.324 --> 06:59.549
master plans kind of got put up on the shelf. And no 
one was ever

06:59.569 --> 07:05.976
pushing to get it implemented, you know. Having 
been here, having gotten here 41 years ago, I think

07:06.614 --> 07:12.240
this campus looks unplanned. It does. The 
architecture is inconsistent. And Paul Stevens

07:15.865 --> 07:18.848
and I used to have some real hard arguments. I kept 
saying, we need some continuity in buildings. He

07:25.796 --> 07:27.358
said, well, the architecture's dying. I said, 
well, who the hell does he work for? You know. And it

07:32.652 --> 07:39.139
was about that time that at least they settled on a 
consistent brick. That was a step. But no, I think

07:42.182 --> 07:50.731
there needed to be some planning standards. And 
each architect got that, just like they got the Red

07:51.052 --> 07:55.316
Book. And these are your boundaries. And Paul 
says, no, you can't give them boundaries. And I

07:59.540 --> 08:05.026
said, well, you can't let them build something 
that's a monument to their own being. And that's

08:06.347 --> 08:10.231
essentially what's happened with a lot of the 
buildings, I think. Typist, this also does need to

08:10.251 --> 08:12.514
be put in there. When I got to UT El Paso 20 years ago 
right now, the architecture out there is copied

08:13.014 --> 08:23.685
after the little nation of Bhutan up in the 
Himalayas near Nepal. Oh. building on the campus

08:25.606 --> 08:30.592
is that style. And one of my great accomplishments 
was a new library building, $28 million. And the

08:34.436 --> 08:45.389
guidelines we gave to the architectural firm, the 
first three principles were it must be Bhutanese,

08:34.436 --> 08:45.389
it must be Bhutanese, it must be Bhutanese. Then 
next is we want as much building per dollar as we can

08:45.409 --> 08:51.656
get. And the next point is it must be expandable in 
each of the four directions horizontally and it

08:55.525 --> 09:00.531
must be expandable vertically. Expandable 
vertically. Yeah. Don't have to go down. You've

09:02.894 --> 09:05.317
got to go, because we don't know how libraries are 
going. And we got a building including

09:05.337 --> 09:09.743
furnishings for $80 a square foot. Wow. And he 
finished six months ahead of schedule. Wow. And it

09:13.688 --> 09:14.849
works superbly. Yeah. So it could be done. Let's 
see. Among the realities that A&M, correct me if

09:21.766 --> 09:35.619
I'm wrong, among the realities that A&M must cope 
with in terms of grounds maintenance and so forth

09:21.766 --> 09:35.619
is we do have one of the most difficult locations in 
terms of oil and climate. Yes, without question. I

09:37.822 --> 09:41.625
know Bob Rucki said that's the reason they put A&M 
here. But the soil is a problem and the water is an

09:43.207 --> 09:47.571
even bigger problem. and the soil can be with 
organic matter and this kind of thing you can you

09:47.922 --> 10:17.541
can kind of work around that a little bit but the 
water problem is you just got to wait on mother

09:47.922 --> 10:17.541
nature to leach it out as far as you know if we went 
deeper for our water wells could we get better

09:47.922 --> 10:17.541
water that i don't know it would probably be hotter 
i guess

09:47.922 --> 10:17.541
but i i really

10:20.120 --> 10:25.088
know I just don't know because I haven't been on in 
on many of those many of those discussions. All

10:27.231 --> 10:35.825
right let's see now we're going to try to summarize 
things of which you're great most proud most

10:27.231 --> 10:35.825
greatest successes.

10:39.951 --> 10:43.056
Oh I think that during all the real building and and 
all like this is that we kept the campus looking

10:43.728 --> 11:04.150
looking very good and that we were able to i think 
change some ideas particularly with the staff

10:43.728 --> 11:04.150
about you know and and create some um intensity 
about hey this is looking good you know and it it

11:06.425 --> 11:35.082
it's something that grows it's it's like i 
mentioned the garden area system you've got one

11:06.425 --> 11:35.082
real good garden over here another one over here 
that's maybe not quite as good and he's always

11:06.425 --> 11:35.082
looking over there seeing what the other guy's 
doing maybe i need to do that and that kind of thing

11:06.425 --> 11:35.082
and it's it's something that that that builds a 
pride because when i got here our folks didn't have

11:06.425 --> 11:35.082
any pride They just, because they were afraid if 
they did something, they'd get torn up. Examples

11:41.912 --> 11:47.658
you can remember where somebody bothered to take 
the time to show some appreciation for the work

11:41.912 --> 11:47.658
y'all had done? Oh, yeah. I've got some nice notes 
from people like O.D. Butler, some

11:53.323 --> 12:04.073
Howard Vestal's one, and there may be some from 
some of the presidents. Perry Atkinson, you know,

12:04.306 --> 12:09.695
a number of folks like that. Any off-campus 
visitors, notes or comments you remember? Yeah, I

12:14.063 --> 12:15.425
can't think of who. Governors?

12:19.993 --> 12:24.640
No, don't think we had any comments from any of the 
governors. All right, now that causes me to think,

12:25.322 --> 12:30.330
did y'all have any involvement in the Bush Library 
dream? a little bit I didn't have any involvement

12:31.981 --> 12:58.528
in uh... in the planning because that was in the Joe 
Sugg era when I didn't get any looks at the reviews

12:31.981 --> 12:58.528
or anything like that but uh... the in the last 
three months of that I lived out there because I was

12:31.981 --> 12:58.528
the liaison between uh... the contractor 
facilities planning and the university as far as

12:58.508 --> 13:04.597
particularly outside and some of the inside, and I 
was trying to help the Bush School. They were

13:05.478 --> 13:06.921
having problems with the building. That's 96, 97? 
This, well, it was, no, it was 90, yeah, 97, 97,

13:09.224 --> 13:15.994
because it was... probably from july until the 
building the building was dedicated and uh that's

13:17.527 --> 13:45.778
that's basically all i did is finally i went i went 
to joe ester and i said look we've got to get this

13:17.527 --> 13:45.778
outside you need to give us a work order and tell the 
contractor to scoot and he did and we got it ready

13:17.527 --> 13:45.778
you know for the dedication uh special moments 
that you remember specific moments of joy, pride?

13:52.874 --> 14:10.973
I don't know when I look out and look at all the trees 
that we planted and

13:52.874 --> 14:10.973
because probably every tree under 15 or 16 inches 
in diameter

14:14.750 --> 14:16.132
been planted since 1973. And being able to, you 
know, kind of delineate the campus and the streets

14:18.475 --> 14:26.547
and this kind of thing. I don't know, we always 
tried to make the landscape as the, try and think of

14:26.567 --> 14:42.090
the term, kind of the glue that held everything 
together, basically. as well as, you know, create

14:43.285 --> 14:47.570
a positive impression. And in a kind of a 
sentimental link there, I heard Bob Rucker told me

14:47.590 --> 15:00.103
that he helped water the first trees out toward the 
new East Gate when he was an undergraduate. Yeah.

15:03.407 --> 15:07.371
Low moments, sad moments? Oh, I guess when we were 
suffering some budget cuts and then when the

15:07.391 --> 15:12.617
merger occurred. That was probably the worst. And 
I guess one of the problems is I'd never had

15:18.194 --> 15:21.359
anything like that. I mean, that was totally new 
ground, you know, because until,

15:22.421 --> 15:37.508
probably until, I believe after Robert took over a 
little bit, but for 16 or 17 years, I had probably

15:39.023 --> 15:45.422
the best ground jobs in the country without any 
question. And I would have, we had people from Tech

15:47.444 --> 15:59.938
and Oklahoma and several other schools that would 
come to kind of see how we did it, you know. And they

16:00.459 --> 16:09.489
have, as an example, Tech and OU have now broken 
their grounds out. And Randy Lacewell at OU

16:09.509 --> 16:13.374
reports directly to the president. He reports 
directly to David Boren. He called me up and he

16:16.756 --> 16:19.900
said, he wants me to report directly to him. What am 
I gonna do? I said, Randy, you can't beat that. I

16:23.764 --> 16:25.887
said, jump on it and run. He said, well, I just hope I 
can outlast the physical plant man.

16:32.594 --> 16:43.607
Of all those years, to whom would you most want to 
express appreciation if all of them were still

16:32.594 --> 16:43.607
alive and could be brought here? Probably would be 
number one, Bob Rucker, and number two, Tom

16:44.701 --> 16:48.086
Cherry. You know, the rest of them were great, no 
question about it. But those two... Put it into

16:54.936 --> 16:56.038
words, why? Well, without those two, I wouldn't 
have been here. Just that simple. And without Bob

17:00.725 --> 17:04.130
Rucker, I wouldn't have been in this field. I don't 
know what I'd be doing now. Did he help attract you

17:06.033 --> 17:10.379
to major in? No.

17:14.654 --> 17:16.636
They had a program. You know, I was a dumb kid from a 
small town. And so everybody else was majoring in

17:21.883 --> 17:26.869
business, so I thought, hey, I will too, you know. 
And so we had to take some science. And I'd grown up

17:30.534 --> 17:34.519
in a hatchery and feed store, and I had a small 
nursery. and had done a lot of stuff on the side out

17:34.803 --> 17:41.575
of the little nursery area.

17:43.679 --> 17:50.972
So I started to register for

17:43.679 --> 17:50.972
classes, and you could take horticulture as a 
science. Hey, I know a little bit about that, I'll

17:52.623 --> 17:55.307
do that. And then I found out that economics and I 
didn't agree and so after the first semester I

17:56.769 --> 18:09.028
switched to horticulture and then Bob came and we I 
had a class under him that I had landscape design

18:09.008 --> 18:32.653
and then I guess the last couple of years he was 
there I worked myself and another friend of mine,

18:09.008 --> 18:32.653
we worked for him for registration and that was 
neat because we got to pre-register, we got our

18:09.008 --> 18:32.653
classes like we wanted it, you know, as well as 
making a little money too and all.

18:33.832 --> 18:46.867
That's kind of how I got over there, because my 
mother was always a big garden clubber, and we'd

18:33.832 --> 18:46.867
had this little nursery, and I'd done a lot of yard 
work and a lot of stuff like that. And I guess if it

18:46.908 --> 18:52.574
hadn't been for that, I'd still been trying to 
major in business. I don't know.

18:56.559 --> 19:00.323
Let's make believe that you were hired as the 
consultant to A&M today. Mm-hmm. If you were a

19:00.933 --> 19:09.019
consultant on the grounds maintenance 
landscaping effort, what advice would you give

19:00.933 --> 19:09.019
them? Well, the first thing, they're going to have 
to spend some money because you cannot keep adding

19:10.383 --> 19:24.186
acres and acres and acres and expect it to look 
class A. Second thing they need to do is they need to

19:24.286 --> 19:32.880
develop some zones of maintenance. At one point in 
time we had four, class A, B, C, and D. D being like

19:32.860 --> 19:42.699
roadways and infrequence and all like that. Class 
A being MSC, rudder tower, president's home,

19:42.739 --> 19:55.864
library, administration building, the real 
heart and core of the campus, that kind of thing.

19:55.844 --> 20:02.413
and that they need to do a little better job in their 
training. One of the problems that I think they've

20:02.733 --> 20:16.232
experienced is that, and I probably shouldn't rag 
on Joe Sugg, but his idea of a grounds maintenance

20:02.733 --> 20:16.232
was an old boy and a lawn mower to pick up. and what 
one of the things that happened with our

20:17.731 --> 20:43.435
irrigation as an example he basically did away for 
a while with the control system and every gardener

20:17.731 --> 20:43.435
was operating their own system and water was 
coming on anywhere anytime and it was all getting

20:17.731 --> 20:43.435
screwed up and everything until finally they were 
able to get a hold of it when i was in the director

20:17.731 --> 20:43.435
well mike and i got together and we got it going back 
where we were using the automated system and only a

20:43.887 --> 20:52.429
few people did the programming because you just 
can't you can't have 125 or 30 controllers and you

20:52.848 --> 21:16.155
know I mean it's just you might have every 
controller in one corner of the campus go and then

20:52.848 --> 21:16.155
you don't have any water for the rest you know it 
just because you can't distribute your water

20:52.848 --> 21:16.155
you're equalizing the distribution of your water 
but uh now I think the money's that and people need

20:52.848 --> 21:16.155
to be educated that to do the job like people would 
like it to be done, it's a costly endeavor, and it

21:16.810 --> 21:25.078
takes some trained people. You can't do it with 
laboring folks. I mean, you need some of those, but

21:28.701 --> 21:40.352
you've got to have some other folks that have the 
knowledge and expertise to do the scheduling and

21:28.701 --> 21:40.352
help the people and train them and this kind of 
thing. Organizationally, it should report? It

21:43.234 --> 21:45.216
should report to the vice president. Vice 
president. Yeah. And geographically, for what

21:47.067 --> 21:54.537
area should it be responsible?

21:54.557 --> 21:56.059
Basically everything outside the buildings? No, 
no. Oh, any of the public here right now, I think

21:59.504 --> 22:09.598
they've got the responsibility of just about 
everything from Texas Avenue to 2818. And that's

22:11.654 --> 22:21.187
all come about with Bush Library because see there 
was a lot of area between the library and the

22:11.654 --> 22:21.187
research park that of necessity had to be. But they 
have that, they have the research park now too.

22:24.771 --> 22:24.891
Yeah. Oh yeah, we've had the research park since 
from the very beginning. At Easterwood Airport

22:30.599 --> 22:31.921
too. Uh-huh. And from the front of the terminal 
building and out. Veterinary Medicine. I'm not

22:39.550 --> 22:44.458
sure how those are handled now, but I know at one 
point in time we did. Another thing I'm proud of too

22:44.498 --> 22:58.502
is, I talked to Jerry about this, but after the 
library came in and we see it was coming about, it

22:44.498 --> 22:58.502
appeared to me that we needed to protect some of the 
area so I went up to Jerry and talked to him and asked

22:59.191 --> 23:23.376
him if he minded me working on some of this and I 
talked to probably a dozen people on campus from

22:59.191 --> 23:23.376
dean of agriculture down to forest science, 
horticulture, rain science, intramurals, rec

22:59.191 --> 23:23.376
sports and the upshot was And I gave it to Jerry, and 
he took it to the board. We got the area along the

23:26.760 --> 23:36.611
creek from horticulture down through the library 
set back, because I could just see some engineers

23:26.760 --> 23:36.611
saying, we can build across that. And my premise 
was that it was time to hold something back for

23:37.832 --> 23:47.963
green area instead of taking it away. Would that be 
an appropriate area for a kind of a natural? Yes, an

23:52.152 --> 23:54.730
arboretum and all like this. I mean, that would be 
superb. Oh, yeah, yeah, and that's what, and I

23:59.045 --> 24:20.076
think they're beginning, I talked to Sam Cotner 
the other day, and I think they're beginning to

23:59.045 --> 24:20.076
work on that, and I want to try to be involved in it, 
because that's something that's really near and

23:59.045 --> 24:20.076
dear to me, because I think it'd be really great to 
have something that you could take some kids out

23:59.045 --> 24:20.076
from a lecture and look at the real thing, or a 
visitor coming to campus would like to look at a

24:20.056 --> 24:31.527
specific plant or something like this and see what 
it really looks like in full living, breathing

24:20.056 --> 24:31.527
color, you know. But we're one of the few land grant 
universities that does not have anything of that

24:32.568 --> 24:41.356
nature. And it's going to cost some money. But a lot 
of it could be done from industry. where they would

24:49.047 --> 24:55.395
give and then give some maintenance subsidy and 
this kind of thing, I think. But that took a lot of

24:55.415 --> 25:01.282
work, because I did the tree inventory for the 
library. Joe Sugg came in to staff me one day, and he

25:02.063 --> 25:14.599
said, he turned to the assistant director that 
Grounds reported to, and he said, I want you to send

25:02.063 --> 25:14.599
a gardener out there and identify all the trees. 
And I said, I don't mean to interrupt, but you need

25:15.777 --> 25:19.379
somebody more than a gardener. And he said, well, 
you're so damn smart, you go do it. I said, okay. It

25:24.715 --> 25:25.636
got me out of the office. Of course, it was in 
August, about like it was now. But there's some

25:28.700 --> 25:33.327
magnificent trees and terrain down in there. It 
could be, there are just a lot of things. Without a

25:36.731 --> 25:46.604
great deal of work, you know, there's water oaks 
down there that big, monstrous trees. Is there

25:48.127 --> 25:51.471
some kind of natural spring that feeds that little 
gullet? Oh, there's not any water that runs all the

25:52.008 --> 25:54.131
time? Well, most of it's drainage water from 
campus because it comes all the way down from, in

25:54.151 --> 26:15.061
fact, that drainage way originates over

25:54.151 --> 26:15.061
east of, across the university and east of the 
Entomology Field Lab. That's where it

26:15.081 --> 26:20.509
originates.

26:20.529 --> 26:20.670
Really? And I don't know whether you remember, but 
before they built the med school, there was a huge

26:22.957 --> 26:28.402
gully that went down through there. And all that's 
underground. In fact, the business or the med

26:30.304 --> 26:40.754
school library and the business school, they're 
setting a straddle of those big box corporates, I

26:30.304 --> 26:40.754
think. Somebody the other day from off campus 
tried to tell me that

26:51.526 --> 26:53.909
Wolfpin Creek drains there. No. Now, Wolfpin 
Creek picks up about the library power plant and on

26:55.130 --> 27:02.598
down. Okay, I've got two questions. Somebody 
walks up to you and gives you a million dollars, a

27:07.663 --> 27:13.610
million-dollar check with one restriction. You 
must pass it on to Texas A&M, and you decide the

27:13.690 --> 27:19.356
purpose of the gift. What would you have to do with 
it? It's pretty easy. A portion of it would go to the

27:23.312 --> 27:27.637
Greenway to get it started. And I think probably 
some of it would go to help the grounds. And then I

27:36.087 --> 27:43.255
think there needs to be some scholarships endowed 
for ornamental horticulture. And on what basis

27:44.617 --> 27:49.022
would the students in that major be selected?

27:51.533 --> 27:55.841
Oh, there would have to be some need involved, but 
there'd also have to be some desire involved. You

27:56.462 --> 28:00.209
know, it's needs one thing and desires another 
thing. If you can get the need and the desire

28:00.269 --> 28:03.936
together, the better. Because you would like if 
someone goes to school, you know, and gets a degree

28:04.697 --> 28:12.512
that they're going to use it. Because I know I have 
classmates that went into insurance and a lot of

28:13.673 --> 28:22.421
different things. They didn't use their degree, 
and I think that's a waste. All right, now I've just

28:27.626 --> 28:30.048
got one question left. Have we not covered 
something that you thought of in advance that we

28:30.088 --> 28:33.932
should have?

28:36.734 --> 28:37.615
I can't think of anything. I really can't. Last 
question is, what feelings do you have in your

28:39.216 --> 28:43.140
heart for Texas A&M today? Well, I'm probably more 
of an Aggie than I am a Red Raider. I've

28:48.239 --> 28:59.796
never seen a place where the former students 
supported like they do. And I thought I'd seen that

29:02.319 --> 29:04.943
at Oklahoma. Of course, that was more for 
football, I guess. But Aggies support it.

29:14.508 --> 29:16.080
There's just no argument about it.
