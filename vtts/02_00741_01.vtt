WEBVTT

00:03.001 --> 00:07.348
I was born in Beeville, Texas, February the 18th, 
1913. Yes, sir. Could you tell us a little bit about

00:08.631 --> 00:14.440
your early life in Beeville, possibly a little bit 
about your father and mother, their names? My

00:15.442 --> 00:19.449
father was Frederick William Heldenfels. He was 
an A&M graduate of 1909. My mother was Alice Cullen

00:23.075 --> 00:28.384
from Austin.

00:29.866 --> 00:33.391
I went into B-Ville and did my school in B-Ville. I 
actually started in Rockport in 1919. Eric had

00:35.394 --> 00:46.891
discharged the school in Rockport, so I moved back 
to B-Ville and did all of my elementary and high

00:35.394 --> 00:46.891
school education in B-Ville. When did you 
graduate from high school? I graduated from high

00:50.516 --> 00:53.781
school in 1931. And then you went to A&M in 1931? I 
went to A&M in September 1931. Why did you go to A&M?

01:02.787 --> 01:03.928
What was your reason for going? Well, I guess you 
might say I was from an A&M family. My father was

01:09.935 --> 01:11.637
with A&M. His brothers were at A&M. My mother's 
brothers went to A&M. I had an older brother at A&M.

01:20.812 --> 01:26.320
and I actually gave no other schooling 
consideration. I see. What line of business was

01:27.682 --> 01:29.324
your father in? My father at that time was in 
construction business. So he had an engineering

01:32.689 --> 01:34.631
degree from 8 to 9? No, he was a graduate architect 
student in the lumber business, had a lumber yard

01:34.771 --> 01:43.123
and an architect. World War I, you got a contract to 
build ships for the government. They moved to

01:49.992 --> 01:52.935
Rockport and opened up the shipyard. And after the 
war, the government at that time were not able to

01:54.057 --> 02:07.693
pay off all the debts to the shipyards, so they gave 
the contractors all of the supplies the materials

02:08.129 --> 02:12.416
that were left and the property and so forth as part 
payment. And from that, he went into the

02:12.476 --> 02:19.548
construction business and marine construction 
to start. In Rockport. Rockport. I see. So then,

02:22.774 --> 02:30.407
could you tell us a little bit about your first 
impressions of the A&M campus when you started as a

02:22.774 --> 02:30.407
freshman? Well, of course when I started 
freshman, my first assignment was in the tents. I

02:36.071 --> 02:50.640
lived in tents that they had at that time between 
the

02:36.071 --> 02:50.640
railroad station up, I believe it's Puryear Law 
Hall, and then they had the tents. And my first

02:51.076 --> 02:59.716
semester I was in tents, and then from there I moved 
into the new odometry building at that time at

02:51.076 --> 02:59.716
Walton Hall. Could you tell us a little bit about 
your life in the tents? Well, they're a little bit

03:03.800 --> 03:06.786
hard to remember. Of course, we got out of them 
before there was really any cold weather. I can't

03:12.997 --> 03:15.081
remember whether we carried wood or coal. I think 
it was coal that we burned in our stove. How many men

03:18.227 --> 03:20.050
to attend? Four, if I recall correctly. Do you 
remember anything about the furnishings, what

03:23.611 --> 03:27.415
they furnished the tents with? No, outside just 
the cotton and so with those days we had wardrobe

03:27.435 --> 03:32.241
trunks. We kept our clothes in wardrobe trunks. I 
see. Were there wooden floors in the tents? Yes.

03:38.328 --> 03:40.430
Any sides to them, wooden sides possibly? I 
believe the sides were about two and a half, three

03:40.450 --> 03:44.034
feet. I see. There's some old pictures of them and I 
just don't really recall. Yes sir, we have some.

03:50.722 --> 03:53.365
Could you tell us what you remember about your 
freshman year? No, not really too much. I remember

03:59.950 --> 04:20.483
when I first went there, I got into, I ran into a 
hometown

03:59.950 --> 04:20.483
person who was, they were starting a Coastal 
Artillery at that time, and he'd been transferred

03:59.950 --> 04:20.483
in to start the new Corps, the Coastal Artillery, 
He asked me to join the Co-Star Tailoring, and for

04:20.885 --> 04:26.133
that reason I got into the Co-Star Tailoring. Were 
the upperclassmen very hard on you? No, of course

04:32.041 --> 04:43.298
they had their hazing, but I think I enjoyed it more 
than I regretted

04:32.041 --> 04:43.298
it. The military, the discipline of the military, 
the cadet corps I think probably did as much good

04:43.717 --> 04:55.950
for me as my whole education at A&M. And what did you 
start out, what was your major? I started out due to

04:59.140 --> 05:02.324
the fact that my father was an architect. I started 
out as an architect, but then I, after the first

05:02.344 --> 05:08.511
year, I changed to finance. And the reason I 
changed to finance at that time, my father became

05:09.592 --> 05:13.957
the owner of a bank.

05:17.201 --> 05:24.810
In fact, Dr. Langford was my first professor up 
there in architecture.

05:26.309 --> 05:28.852
Did you then go ahead and finish out in finance? I 
finished out in finance, but I've never been into

05:28.872 --> 05:34.400
construction. I worked in construction every 
summer, all through school, and from the day I got

05:35.020 --> 05:45.574
to college, I went into the construction field.

05:47.176 --> 05:52.924
Could you possibly tell us about some of your more 
memorable experiences while you were at A&M? good

05:54.558 --> 06:00.306
classes that you had, events that happened there 
that kicked off? Well, I think that one of the

06:00.326 --> 06:07.817
professors that impressed me most was Dr. 
Crawford, mechanical engineer.

06:10.541 --> 06:22.118
I really don't remember the instance that 
occurred, but for some reason he made an

06:10.541 --> 06:22.118
impression on me, and I've remembered him all the 
time since then, because he taught me. in the old

06:22.638 --> 06:27.763
slide room, I forget what we called it then, the 
mechanical engineering slide room. Professor

06:27.783 --> 06:31.987
Charles Denver Crawford is still living and is in 
good health. He's quite a fine old gentleman.

06:35.891 --> 06:40.015
Can you remember what social life went on there? 
Well, there wasn't actually any much of what you

06:40.035 --> 06:45.580
might call social life. You had to either catch a 
bus or a train into Brown. It did have a motion

06:49.300 --> 06:52.844
picture. I forget whether it was one day or two days 
or nights a week. I don't really recall. Do you

06:59.471 --> 07:00.973
remember where they held it? It had a building 
there in the general vicinity where the All Faiths

07:01.353 --> 07:07.199
Chapel is now. They had a theater there. Could it 
possibly have been called Assembly Hall? I

07:13.586 --> 07:16.249
believe it was just a movie theater. I believe 
that's what it was for. I see. It was a building in

07:19.218 --> 07:22.681
that vicinity. And of course you all had the 
football games to go to. We had football games and

07:25.664 --> 07:32.791
we had a, I still remember, I believe it was Casey's 
that had a place in the old YMCA. It was kind of a drug

07:32.931 --> 07:37.695
store or a kind of gathering point there. That was, 
see when he was there the whole, the enrollment was

07:37.756 --> 07:45.683
around 2,500.

07:48.515 --> 07:57.341
I believe in my class there were 527 or something 
like that that was started out that year. Do you

07:58.765 --> 08:01.393
remember any of your fellow students? Oh, very 
definitely. In fact, my roommate, I roomed with

08:03.449 --> 08:19.606
the same person for four years, and unfortunately 
about six months ago he died, but I was associated

08:03.449 --> 08:19.606
with him ever since I was out of school. What was his 
name? Harold T. Bailey. Mike Dillingham was

08:24.311 --> 08:27.435
another close friend of mine in school. I still see 
him occasionally. and I was on the Corps staff at

08:31.259 --> 08:35.807
that time. We only had the one staff at the Corps. I 
happened to be senior year. I was on the Corps staff

08:42.058 --> 08:50.854
and most of the other people, persons on the staff 
went into professional either military or the

08:51.442 --> 09:04.262
Navy, Marine Corps, and in fact there's quite a few 
of the boys that are my classmates who went into the

08:51.442 --> 09:04.262
Army or the Navy upon graduation to the Air Force. 
Now this was during the Depression. Can you

09:08.789 --> 09:12.555
remember how the Depression affected student 
life or affected Well, no. I do remember that most

09:16.627 --> 09:23.818
of the boys were real happy that they had a job offer 
in the $100 a month range when they got out. It was

09:24.279 --> 09:30.549
about what I think $100 to $125 a month was about 
what we were getting. I see. Well, I was just

09:32.352 --> 09:38.982
curious to know if it made life on the campus a 
little tighter, if it was a little bit less for

09:32.352 --> 09:38.982
everybody? Well,

09:39.940 --> 09:45.205
I really don't remember. Of course, there wasn't 
much when you went there. You paid your tuition,

09:48.288 --> 09:56.596
your books, and you really had not much to do away 
from it. Most of the boys stayed on the campus

09:56.776 --> 09:59.739
weekend. They didn't leave weekend, and that 
probably was maybe from depression or modes of

09:59.759 --> 10:09.508
travel, you might say, and of course at those times 
you were An automobile on the campus was against

10:09.488 --> 10:14.595
the rules. Some boys had them and kept them in 
brown, but there weren't many automobiles.

10:25.229 --> 10:31.918
I have heard, do you remember any times when you 
might have seen hobos and bums riding railroad

10:32.607 --> 10:36.553
through and stopping off at the school, possibly? 
No, I don't. Some that I've heard stories, some of

10:40.059 --> 10:43.925
the boys used to catch trains and ride. I never did. 
I always bought my ticket and didn't ride that way.

10:49.294 --> 10:55.223
Did you ever have any major problems during your 
student days that you were able to? I don't recall

10:56.198 --> 11:01.906
any major problems that I had. What other 
professors besides Crawford? Do you remember any

11:04.389 --> 11:05.931
others? Yes, I remember the librarian. I believe 
Dr. Mayo at that time. I remember him, and I

11:10.497 --> 11:20.130
remembered Dr. Morgan, who was a math teacher I 
played. I remember, of course, I remember Dr.

11:20.482 --> 11:28.190
Francis that was in the animal husbandry. 
Veterinarian? Yeah. Do you remember anything

11:30.752 --> 11:31.873
about him? Well, he was very colorful, sort of. 
I've heard of this.

11:39.021 --> 11:48.430
I don't remember the stories he used to tell, but he 
was a very, very colorful person, and it was a

11:39.021 --> 11:48.430
privilege to get to visit with him, or in groups 
where he used to talk. When you were there, Bizzle

11:50.030 --> 11:54.639
was president of A&M. Walton. Walton was 
president of A&M, okay. Excuse me. Did you ever

12:00.510 --> 12:03.155
have any dealings with him? I knew him and one of the 
reasons that I knew him, my older brother married a

12:03.315 --> 12:13.354
brown girl. her father was in the extension 
service. Do you remember what his name was? Arms,

12:19.530 --> 12:20.331
RMS. And he was a very close friend of Dr. Walter and 
through some association there I got to know him

12:20.872 --> 12:29.823
personally. I see. What type of man was he? I 
thought he was very sort of quiet, sort of an

12:31.766 --> 12:40.717
easygoing sort of person as far as I could tell. He 
wasn't He wasn't high strung at all or anything

12:42.325 --> 12:45.469
like that. He seemed like a very... I remember Dr. 
Bolton too, the dean of engineering at that time.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.942
Did you know him? Knew him very well, yes. What type 
of individual was he? Well, he was... I would say a

13:02.137 --> 13:11.473
little bit more of a stern person than Dr. Walton, 
but there was nothing out of it. How did the

13:11.493 --> 13:16.201
students feel about President Walton? Was he 
generally supported by the students? As far as I

13:18.144 --> 13:27.199
know, I don't know of any, I don't recall of anybody 
being opposed to him in any way. After you

13:28.732 --> 13:32.817
graduated from A&M, then where did you go? Well, I 
came to Corpus Christi and I was joining my father

13:32.837 --> 13:41.206
in business. My brother, who preceded me, 
graduated two years ahead of me, but also. And from

13:47.994 --> 13:52.599
there, those days, we traveled around. We had a job 
in and say, Houston, well, I'd go and I'd live on the

13:54.905 --> 13:57.852
job. And that's how I traveled around. I mostly 
stayed on the coast where I was working. And I came

14:02.424 --> 14:04.609
from Carpus. And from Carpus, I went up into 
Missouria County. Did you have a lot to learn about

14:07.877 --> 14:10.905
the construction business when you Well, I had 
worked all the time. The fact is, from the time I can

14:16.633 --> 14:27.491
remember, I had worked around construction and in 
construction, so it was nothing new to me. Do you

14:28.293 --> 14:31.358
feel that your degree in finance helped you also? 
Yes, I took, most of my electives I took in the field

14:31.338 --> 14:51.090
that I knew that I would be using, and I tried to more 
or less give my staff a rounded education, and if I

14:31.338 --> 14:51.090
had to do over again, if I knew I was going to do the 
same thing, I don't know if I'd change it at all. So

14:51.110 --> 14:52.532
you felt very well prepared. Yes, I did. So after 
you came to Corpus, then you've really been here

14:55.237 --> 14:58.662
all along. No, it was Carpus. I left here in 1936 and 
went into Brazoria County and then from there into

15:02.602 --> 15:12.837
Houston and the Anuag, Beaumont area. and back 
into El Campo and then about the time they started

15:13.070 --> 15:26.965
the WPA program and these counties had quite a bit 
of work and I came back into the Corpus area. About

15:27.727 --> 15:30.454
that time they started the Naval Air Station. And 
we had all the work that we could handle right here

15:30.434 --> 15:34.598
locally. And I was here until I went in the Army, 
which I was called. I had my commission, and I was

15:38.502 --> 15:42.806
called in the Army in September of 41. What unit 
were you called into? I was called into automatic

15:45.369 --> 15:46.970
weapons. In what division? Well, I wasn't in. I was 
in a separate tag. I see. I see. And I got out of the

15:54.978 --> 15:59.122
state of the service until February of 45. Mm-hmm. 
Where were you assigned most of the time? Well, I

16:03.475 --> 16:14.626
was in Africa, Sicily, and then Sicily and Italy I 
was assigned to the support to the 1st Ranger

16:03.475 --> 16:14.626
Battalion, General Darby's. Well, it was Colonel 
Darby's then.

16:20.833 --> 16:25.178
All of my overseas was in Africa, Sicily, and 
Italy. I see. So then you saw quite a bit of combat.

16:29.082 --> 16:29.162
Yes. And then after you left the service in 45, did 
you come back to Corpus Christi? I had my home. In

16:34.969 --> 16:41.464
fact, when I was called into service, at that time I 
didn't own a home. But when war was declared, I

16:41.950 --> 16:46.195
bought a home, put my family. I had a wife and two 
children. I see. When were you married? I was

16:50.080 --> 16:52.103
married in 1936. Could you give me your wife's 
name? Yes, her name was Hazel Norville. See, from

16:56.668 --> 16:57.489
where? Well, she was originally born in Russell 
County, but I met her in Missouri County when she

16:57.810 --> 17:07.722
was working for the county commissioner when I was 
up there doing work, and I met her in Missouri

16:57.810 --> 17:07.722
County. And could you tell us a little bit about 
your life after the war? You said you had a house.

17:13.203 --> 17:19.771
Well, I moved back here and more or less took up just 
where I had left off. My brothers and father were

17:19.871 --> 17:22.594
still running the business. So I tried to catch up 
on any new methods or technology and so forth. It's

17:30.984 --> 17:33.507
been the same ever since. Now you were appointed to 
the board. Yes. By what government? Price

17:38.438 --> 17:39.679
Daniels. Price Daniels. What year was this? 1961. 
And you served how many years? Twelve years.

17:44.686 --> 17:45.066
Twelve years. Could you tell us a little bit about 
your experiences on the board? Yes, well actually

17:49.772 --> 18:02.447
I think that's probably one of the most rewarding 
experiences I've had and probably I was very

17:49.772 --> 18:02.447
fortunate to be on the board during the time that I 
was on because I think A&M had actually made the

18:02.900 --> 18:15.995
great stride in both the growth student-wise and 
academic-wise, too.

18:16.015 --> 18:21.120
It was a very, very rewarding experience, and I 
served as president of the board. General Rudder

18:22.221 --> 18:29.970
there, president of the university, which was a 
very good, experiencing time. Yes, I'll ask you in

18:30.355 --> 18:33.079
a minute about some impressions of General 
Rudder. He's sort of a special interest of mine.

18:36.524 --> 18:39.689
Was President Morgan, was he president when you 
came on the board? No, Tom Harrington was

18:39.949 --> 18:41.852
president. All right, so Morgan, let's see, 
Harrington. Harrington was chancellor and Earl

18:43.755 --> 18:49.343
Rudder was... I see. Then Morgan and Hardy left by 
that time. Yes. I was wondering if possibly you

18:54.004 --> 18:56.607
knew some of the incidents. I knew him. You did. But 
I've been pretty close to A&M ever since I've been

18:58.469 --> 19:04.536
out of A&M. How did you stay active with A&M? I'm 
curious. Was it through the former students?

19:10.462 --> 19:13.225
Mostly it was through athletics. I've always And 
then in the construction business, it seemed like

19:14.787 --> 19:21.657
we were always the one that they would call and want 
us to work with. And so we were, I've always had

19:21.677 --> 19:28.847
several of the athletes working for me every 
summer. I see, so you worked with many of the

19:28.867 --> 19:30.650
coaches then? I worked, I knew practically every 
coach from time, well the same coach that I was in

19:30.670 --> 19:44.710
school with which I knew Coach Norton real well, he 
was still coach there after he got out of the Army,

19:30.670 --> 19:44.710
and then they hired Stidler, who was from Carpus. 
He was a high school coach here at Carpus for a

19:48.023 --> 19:49.865
while. I knew Harry Stidler very well. So if I was 
from Coach Norton, I've known all the coaches

19:51.408 --> 19:57.015
personally. Ask a personal question. You can 
answer it or not. Who out of all that group

19:59.479 --> 20:01.822
impressed you the most? Bear Bryant. Bear Bryant. 
I think that was a stupid question. I can't. I think

20:06.548 --> 20:11.375
he's just not even outstanding in anything. He's 
just that type of person. I see. I think it's

20:15.115 --> 20:24.164
interesting that you've been able to work with the 
athletic department with so many

20:15.115 --> 20:24.164
people. Were you saddened by Norton's leaving, or 
do you think it was timely that he left? No, I knew

20:27.856 --> 20:35.954
Norton very well and I think it was time that he 
left. I think everything had changed and he hadn't

20:36.034 --> 20:39.962
kept up with the changing times. He was a personal 
friend of mine after he left as well as when he was

20:41.566 --> 20:45.915
there.

20:49.979 --> 20:52.823
Can you think of any of the others that impressed 
you besides Brian? He's such an overwhelming

20:52.843 --> 20:54.665
personality. Well, I think that Gene's talent was 
probably, next to Brian, he was probably the most

20:55.626 --> 21:19.918
knowledgeable in football, although he had

20:55.626 --> 21:19.918
some traits that made it where he was in the head 
coach, whether it was age or what, but I believe

20:55.626 --> 21:19.918
that next to Brian, he probably, I thought, was 
more football, smarter coach. and the rest of

21:20.337 --> 21:23.344
them. Well, I think many people think that he is an 
excellent coach and probably will do very well at

21:23.364 --> 21:28.135
Dallas. Well, he probably will. I knew Ray 
Jarrett, of course his job was more or less given to

21:38.360 --> 21:42.745
him, going on account of the Steidler situation. 
He was there, just able to accept it, and he was

21:42.805 --> 21:55.801
probably a great assistant coach, but would not be 
a good head coach, the same as several of them, like

21:42.805 --> 21:55.801
Jim Meyer, probably. Maybe the greatest 
assistant coach in the world, but just never could

21:55.821 --> 21:59.506
be a head coach. Some people say that about 
Stallings. Maybe time will tell. Well, I don't

22:04.853 --> 22:07.376
know. He certainly knows what it's about. And have 
you worked with him in Ballard? I've worked with

22:13.583 --> 22:15.025
him in Ballard. I was on the group that interviewed 
him before they hired him, and I've worked very

22:15.185 --> 22:23.215
closely with him since he's been there. I see. 
Well, let's get back to your board experiences.

22:28.241 --> 22:31.705
Can you think of some of the major occurrences that 
happened during your 12-year Yes, of course the

22:32.140 --> 22:54.366
currency was when the compulsory military, it was 
dropped, and which was, but it had to, almost had to

22:32.140 --> 22:54.366
be on account of the way the Army and Air Corps 
changed their, where they could have a two-year

22:32.140 --> 22:54.366
program with the junior and senior year. The 
coeducational

23:02.313 --> 23:11.448
was brought about during the time of my board and 
I'm real happy with the way it's worked out. I'm

23:12.069 --> 23:15.955
sure that was a tremendous struggle and a change 
too. Well, it was. Most all the board always felt

23:19.441 --> 23:23.427
like they should be. coeducation on campus 
without housing. That was the only real struggle

23:27.705 --> 23:31.812
with the board. We didn't think anyone should be 
deprived of an education because they were

23:31.872 --> 23:38.102
female. And if they lived in Bryan, but their 
parents were unable to afford to send them

23:38.383 --> 23:45.094
somewhere else, it felt like they shouldn't be 
able to do it. get their education. But the housing

23:48.387 --> 23:55.276
was the only thing that was really, to me, was a 
real, had a struggling decision. Was the board

23:55.296 --> 23:58.700
pretty much divided on this issue? Very 
definitely. It had been divided on both

24:00.021 --> 24:04.107
co-education and housing. I see. Probably some 
very strong feelings about some former students.

24:07.270 --> 24:09.293
I can understand their situation. Yes, and we got 
lots of mail. I'm sure you did. It was probably both

24:14.345 --> 24:17.151
bad and good. It wasn't bad,

24:17.171 --> 24:22.804
but we got to get. Yes. You say you have been pleased 
with the way coeducation has worked. Yes, I am. Of

24:29.270 --> 24:33.897
course, I'm not on the board now. I don't like to 
dictate. I hope that they don't go into where they

24:36.040 --> 24:39.706
start having the sorority. We've never had the 
fraternities on the campus. I hope they don't, but

24:41.769 --> 24:45.034
I imagine it will come in time. Maybe, maybe not. We 
hope not. I think one thing that has been a problem

24:48.939 --> 24:53.226
is the growth of the campus. They've grown so fast, 
too fast really. Well, a thing that I also hope that

24:56.438 --> 25:04.640
they don't change the curriculum just to fit the 
female students. I think it ain't even one of the

25:05.904 --> 25:09.975
things they ain't even always done. It's taught a 
person a trade, a saleable trade, and it stayed

25:10.495 --> 25:24.145
away from the education just to be educated, you 
might say. In other words, I felt like a person went

25:24.205 --> 25:28.555
to A&M, you could go hire him, he could do 
something. And if they start changing the

25:29.108 --> 25:36.740
curriculum to meet, to satisfy the female 
student, then we may lose that. I think we're

25:36.940 --> 25:40.947
losing off a lot over there. Do you feel University 
of Boston should have a cut-off level that maybe we

25:40.967 --> 25:49.280
shouldn't grow to be, say, as large as the 
University of Boston? Well, I think it all... All

25:52.126 --> 25:55.832
universities should have a cutoff at one take. In 
other words, there's a point when you once reach it

25:55.852 --> 26:04.125
that I think your efficiency just couldn't be 
there. Now, it should be flexible. I don't think

26:05.788 --> 26:08.552
you should say 20,000 and that's it. I mean, it 
should be in a range of 19, 21. Try to keep it in the

26:11.677 --> 26:14.522
way that you would do it by... entrance 
examinators. How you do it, that's always been the

26:18.482 --> 26:22.580
problem, where you cut it. And they've The 
entrance in the veterinary medicine has always

26:25.218 --> 26:30.084
been a real problem to the board. There's so many 
little won't in there that say there's three or

26:30.104 --> 26:35.891
four hundred that are qualified. They can pass any 
test you give them, but you can only take 128. How do

26:38.554 --> 26:41.558
you do this? And the board actually gets more 
harassment. From that one thing, anything that

26:47.763 --> 26:56.737
I've ever had, more people would call you, 
including the governor.

26:56.798 --> 27:00.183
And Dr. Price, I admire him for it. He had his 
standards. He stayed by it, and nobody could turn

27:01.325 --> 27:04.129
him. He went by the rules and regulated his own, and 
I think he was good, but I just, I don't know how you

27:13.531 --> 27:33.675
when you want to limit the enrollment to the to into 
a school but just how they are limited now by

27:13.531 --> 27:33.675
raising the entrance requirements and to have but 
I don't think that you can say you know you can take

27:13.531 --> 27:33.675
the one-fourths top fourths back I don't think you 
can do that. What other problems can you find on the

27:33.695 --> 27:35.917
field? Can you think of any others? No, of course I,

27:38.962 --> 27:49.619
I wouldn't, I wouldn't think you could call it a 
problem. Of course you always, you always had

27:49.639 --> 27:57.932
things like the, what did they call it then? Well, 
it's not the union, but they have some society that

27:59.313 --> 28:07.261
they- AAUP, is that what it is? American 
Association of University Professors. They

28:11.245 --> 28:15.429
caused us a lot of bit of problem. That is, a lot of 
headaches, you might say. Was this over the Gibbs

28:19.233 --> 28:21.436
finding? Over the Gibbs, or that type of thing.

28:26.937 --> 28:46.077
to me, who had been dealing with either union, 
non-union, or construction work all my life, I

28:26.937 --> 28:46.077
didn't see the

28:26.937 --> 28:46.077
real threat that General Rudder and some of them, 
they felt like they could leave a black mark on the

28:46.782 --> 29:04.167
university and you couldn't hire the type of 
professors you needed and after fooling with this

28:46.782 --> 29:04.167
several years and finally we just said well we 
can't satisfy them so forget them which we should

28:46.782 --> 29:04.167
have done to start with and so That was the only real 
thing. It was a tickly situation to deal with, not

29:07.952 --> 29:17.070
knowing what, thinking you might hurt the 
university, didn't want to hurt the university,

29:07.952 --> 29:17.070
tell you what you're doing was wrong. Well, I would 
say time has proved you right, probably, because

29:17.230 --> 29:24.805
while we're still on their black list, if there is 
such a thing, it hasn't hurt us. Well, most of the

29:24.970 --> 29:35.928
universities that were on the blacklist tried to 
get off and decided you can't get off and still run

29:24.970 --> 29:35.928
the university, so they're staying on. The 
University of Texas was on it for years.

29:42.219 --> 29:45.044
How do you believe General Rutter handled the 
university? I think General Rutter was probably

29:45.585 --> 29:51.214
the best thing that ever happened to Texas A&M. He 
was strictly an administrator. I don't think he

29:54.116 --> 30:10.838
was an educator, but I think at A&M it was a period 
right then that the need and demand of his status,

29:54.116 --> 30:10.838
somebody that could just take the bull by the horn, 
you might say, and be an administrator and get

29:54.116 --> 30:10.838
enrolled in it. He did. Did you get to know him very 
well? Oh, I knew him very well. He stayed at my home

30:14.203 --> 30:15.885
many times. I knew him well before he was president 
of the university. I

30:20.320 --> 30:32.885
don't think any one man could have done any more 
than he did. I think it ain't him as where he is today

30:32.905 --> 30:36.692
due to General Rudder. Do you feel that he really 
managed to keep A&M quiet during the period of the

30:37.516 --> 30:48.591
60s when other campuses were in turmoil and 
upheaval, were having their problems? A&M, while

30:48.611 --> 30:51.555
they had problems, they never got out of hand. 
Well, I think that he had quite a bit to do with it,

30:51.575 --> 31:01.228
but I think that your student body had more to do 
with it than he as an individual, because the type

30:51.575 --> 31:01.228
of students you have, were not the type of students 
that you would find in these liberal arts colleges

31:01.208 --> 31:11.145
I referred to a while ago as people just being 
educated to be educated. In other words, you're

31:11.166 --> 31:14.231
educated, but you can't do anything. Well, that's 
the type that seemed to be caught in all the

31:14.251 --> 31:25.090
trouble, but the people they were learning, 
trying to learn something, the saleable trade,

31:14.251 --> 31:25.090
well, they didn't seem to have any trouble. Did 
this ever come up at the board while this was going

31:25.070 --> 31:32.018
on and campuses in California were burning, so to 
speak? Yes, it came up to the board. In fact, there

31:33.840 --> 31:47.635
were several times that the board got notices that 
a certain agitator had caught a bus in a certain

31:33.840 --> 31:47.635
city and headed out that way and he'd pick up a 
brine. alertness of the Rangers and so forth, they

31:47.885 --> 31:59.398
were picked up at the bus station and generally if 
they had a weapon or something, I don't know what

31:47.885 --> 31:59.398
they did, they had some reason to pick them up and 
search them. So they were agitated, they tried to

32:00.439 --> 32:10.450
move into it, but I think the general rudder did see 
that the security was We had during the board, we

32:11.290 --> 32:22.387
would get letters that there were going to be 
protests marched on the board meetings, but they

32:11.290 --> 32:22.387
never, none of them ever showed up. This should 
have been gratifying to you anyway. Yes, it was.

32:25.452 --> 32:27.976
The student body did not become overly agitated. 
You said you knew General Rudder well. He was an

32:31.362 --> 32:32.483
administrator. What kind of man was he personally 
out of the boardroom? privately. He was great

32:37.474 --> 32:40.661
company. He loved me around. He was a good 
conversationalist. He was the type of person I

32:47.316 --> 32:52.949
could spend the day with.

32:52.969 --> 32:55.173
I see. Do you feel that If A&M has any great 
weaknesses or if we've had any failures over the

32:58.102 --> 33:07.892
years while you were associated with the board, 
maybe a missed opportunity, something we could

32:58.102 --> 33:07.892
have done and didn't? Oh, yes, you always, you'll 
have those, but I don't think that they had any

33:08.432 --> 33:17.401
missed opportunities that are actually set them 
back. I think it was some opportunities that we

33:17.502 --> 33:27.872
probably could have taken and we probably may be a 
little bit further ahead, but I don't believe we

33:17.502 --> 33:27.872
had a missing opportunity to set us back.

33:30.113 --> 33:36.743
Lots of times it's on whether you have the money to 
do this or not. Of course, I think money has made a

33:36.763 --> 33:41.651
great difference to the school. We're getting a 
little

33:41.671 --> 33:48.602
more now. I think we were slow getting the 
psychotron just because money situation. We

33:56.362 --> 34:01.409
should have had it several years before we did, and 
I don't believe it set us back any. We should have

34:02.350 --> 34:05.634
had the engineering building. Well, the first 
board meeting I attended, the A&M, when I was sworn

34:06.956 --> 34:16.328
in, the board approved the plans of the 
engineering building. What's now the Zachary

34:16.349 --> 34:17.650
Building. Zachary Building. And I was on the board 
12 years. I think it was built in my eleventh year.

34:23.422 --> 34:37.830
So it's over for some things we drug our feet on or 
some things we shouldn't have drug our feet on and

34:23.422 --> 34:37.830
that's going to happen in anything like that. Who 
out of all the members of the board that you served

34:37.850 --> 34:43.000
with impressed you? Well, we had some very great 
men on the board. Dr. Boyle was a fine man. Sir

34:51.441 --> 34:54.705
Gardner Simon was a fine man. L.F. Peterson, a very 
dedicated board member. But you served with

35:01.115 --> 35:09.848
people that were corporate heads like Gardner 
Simon and Dr. Boyle. They never missed your

35:10.604 --> 35:13.089
meeting. They were just dedicated and it was 
really gratifying to serve on the board with that

35:13.249 --> 35:22.287
type of people. What do you think were some of the 
greatest successes of the board?

35:30.989 --> 35:35.537
Well, I don't really, I really don't know how to 
answer that question. So weighty problems that

35:35.557 --> 35:44.093
you managed to finally solve where there might 
have been great division?

35:46.697 --> 35:55.393
Well, I don't, I don't really believe we had those 
type of problems because actually the board seem

35:55.913 --> 35:59.918
to be pretty well dedicated to trying to do the same 
thing. There would be lots of arguments or

35:59.978 --> 36:08.969
conversation about how to do things, but 
generally they were all worked out. I don't know of

36:09.069 --> 36:19.542
any problem we had

36:09.069 --> 36:19.542
that really confronted the court, where it might 
have divided the court. You were on the board when

36:21.226 --> 36:26.092
Rutter was selected as president. Yes. Was he the 
first choice? Oh, yes. There never was any other

36:31.418 --> 36:37.486
thought about

36:31.418 --> 36:37.486
anybody else? No. Then you were on the board when 
they also selected Jack Williams. Yes. And he is an

36:42.812 --> 36:46.657
educator, probably, more than an administrator. 
In fact, I'm the one who recommended Jack

36:46.737 --> 36:50.642
Williams. Really, I talked to Earl Rudder prior to 
Earl's death. In fact, it was back in about

36:58.362 --> 37:02.347
October. At that time, Bulwer felt like General 
Rudder needed some help. And we were wanting him to

37:08.014 --> 37:15.984
get somebody to work with him and to help him. And we 
had had talked about, he and I had talked about Jack

37:17.437 --> 37:37.318
Williams, and we had called him, telephoned, and 
he had had a meeting set up to talk to Dr. Williams

37:17.437 --> 37:37.318
about Bing coming in there as the body of Fred, but 
that meeting never took place. stroke that he had.

37:39.152 --> 37:40.594
Where did you know Dr. Williams from? By 
reputation or personally? No, I knew Dr.

37:42.176 --> 37:48.464
Williams, I was the president of the A&M board when 
he was over at the coordinating board. And I got to,

37:49.745 --> 37:53.430
he spent quite a bit of time at A&M. I'd see him up 
there quite often and he always told me he liked

37:53.450 --> 38:02.761
A&M, he liked to come there, this is where things 
are happening and this campus is so much different

37:53.450 --> 38:02.761
than the rest of it. He liked me like he liked it. He 
was making a talk down in Carpus

38:07.893 --> 38:13.601
after General Rudder's death. I called him on the 
phone and asked him if he would allow me to put his

38:14.482 --> 38:34.170
hat in the ring for the selection of the President 
and he said he just didn't know anything he liked

38:14.482 --> 38:34.170
better and so I did suggest him and we talked to 
quite a few people and but I think that that

38:35.450 --> 38:57.007
everybody's happy I know that I'm just 
particularly there that he's there and I believe

38:35.450 --> 38:57.007
it that it was time and he moved in it's time that we 
needed an educator and we'd gone through the

38:35.450 --> 38:57.007
building stage to what Rudder had brought us and 
then an educator moving in is what we need an

38:35.450 --> 38:57.007
academic man there now. And of course he's done an 
excellent job. He's done an outstanding job. Do

39:01.117 --> 39:05.563
you have anything coming on where the Corps of 
Cadets is going now? It's considerably different

39:05.964 --> 39:08.247
than when you were in school there. Well, of course 
it's different than when I was in school, but it's

39:08.267 --> 39:22.468
as large as all the school within it, and I think 
that if I was a youngster going to A&M today, I would

39:08.267 --> 39:22.468
get in the cadet corps. I don't understand, of 
course I'm not that age anymore, To me, everybody,

39:29.838 --> 39:37.687
well, cadet corps is still a symbol of A&M. It's the 
image. I know it's a discipline that some of them

39:40.811 --> 39:50.342
don't want, but to me, that discipline is just as 
much a part of education.

39:50.362 --> 39:51.543
I hope it comes back. I just do. You know, next year 
we're going to have girls in the Corps. Well, I

39:56.386 --> 40:02.955
think that's... My father always said that they 
ought to have a wax up there. He was always for that.

40:06.100 --> 40:17.495
So I think as long as they're going to have the girls 
or ladies in the services, I think they should have

40:06.100 --> 40:17.495
them in the Corps. I don't know that they'll mix 
them. I imagine they'll have their own... Oh, yes.

40:24.101 --> 40:37.042
I understand the way they're going to do it is 
they're going to have the first year their

40:24.101 --> 40:37.042
officers will be males who are in the Corps now, and 
then they'll turn loose on their own after they've

40:24.101 --> 40:37.042
got them indoctrinated into the ways and policies 
and traditions. It should work out well.

40:41.209 --> 40:42.792
Can you think of anything else off the board? I 
don't want to miss anything, and yet, not having

40:42.812 --> 40:47.179
been there, I'm not sure what to ask. Of course I 
was, I spent most of my time on the board as the

40:47.480 --> 41:02.097
chairman of the building committee and due to my 
experience, I'm sure that's the reason they

40:47.480 --> 41:02.097
selected me for, and I was It was very gratifying to 
me that I think if I did add anything to it on the

41:03.140 --> 41:11.112
board, that's probably where I made my 
contribution. We built lots of buildings up there

41:12.574 --> 41:20.486
we didn't think we ever could build or would build.

41:20.666 --> 41:26.795
I think the rudder complex would be a compliment to 
any university, any campus. I don't know of anyone

41:27.016 --> 41:29.299
that had anything like it. I'm glad to see it named 
that because it was actually Earl Rudder's dream.

41:36.306 --> 41:37.810
That was what he wanted.

41:40.497 --> 41:42.242
We worked out a way to build it for him. Could you 
tell us a little bit more about your building

41:44.146 --> 41:49.295
experiences on the board? What problems you had? 
Maybe funding? No, we didn't really have any

41:52.881 --> 41:59.452
problem with the building. I think we were very 
fortunate in our architect and engineer

41:59.472 --> 42:05.462
selection. They just carried a job out, just 
magnificent. We had an organization there, and

42:09.227 --> 42:20.441
due to Earl Rutter's administration, and being an 
administrator, he set up an organization to

42:09.227 --> 42:20.441
handle this building. And they handled it, and 
they handled it fine. So having trouble with

42:22.744 --> 42:24.486
finance? No, we didn't. A&M, of course, with the 
permanent university fund, which I guess you're

42:26.348 --> 42:33.357
familiar with, they were to sell the bombs. I'd

42:33.961 --> 42:43.537
say trouble, they do on dormitories, they'd have 
revenue financing. There is some trouble, but it

42:43.557 --> 42:50.890
was never a problem that we couldn't solve. Well, I 
just wondered because for years, money and A&M,

42:54.970 --> 42:57.993
And that's the main problem, just never had 
enough. Well, there's money, they still don't

42:58.013 --> 43:05.942
have enough, but for your essential needs, they 
can find it. You don't have enough to spread out

43:06.082 --> 43:08.184
everywhere. No, no, not like some people have. I 
don't think they'll ever have it again.

43:15.512 --> 43:18.295
Oh, let me see if there's anything else I can ask 
you.

43:26.830 --> 43:33.799
Do you have any one accomplishment that you feel 
particularly

43:26.830 --> 43:33.799
proud about? You mean on the board or in any... In 
your lifetime. No, I can't say that I have. I think

43:45.833 --> 43:47.235
it... I try to serve my community in all the 
different civic things. I try to give a certain

43:52.589 --> 44:04.550
amount of my time to the civic things, and I guess I 
can't say that anyone stands out. I think you're

44:05.091 --> 44:06.273
being too modest. There has to be something.

44:10.982 --> 44:12.244
Well, I certainly appreciate it.
