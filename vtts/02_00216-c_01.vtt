WEBVTT

00:01.482 --> 00:17.143
The amount that went to each of them was not readily 
identifiable by anybody at the legislative

00:01.482 --> 00:17.143
level, but of course it was internally because of 
the way we put the budgets together with Dean

00:01.482 --> 00:17.143
Benson. And before he retired, we did change our 
budget structure, so we separated the two and each

00:17.964 --> 00:30.460
of us go in with our own budget request like each of 
our other system partners now. And then when Mr.

00:31.368 --> 00:50.233
Rutter dies in early 1970, Jack Williams comes in 
later that year, John Calhoun as vice president,

00:31.368 --> 00:50.233
did TTI's role change under them? Not really. We 
still, let's see, I guess Fred was what he was...

00:57.355 --> 01:24.696
vice president for engineering he carried 
several titles during this period of time and we

00:57.355 --> 01:24.696
still reported through Fred even to Calhoun and 
then later to Calhoun himself under a different

00:57.355 --> 01:24.696
structure I've got a list of all the different 
people that I've reported to and I think there were

00:57.355 --> 01:24.696
17 different ones on that list of fellows of who we 
have really reported to. But anyway, there is a

01:27.839 --> 01:35.626
bunch of turnover in the system and in university 
as well. We've reported both ways from time to

01:35.646 --> 01:37.688
time. Fred had always been a supporter, of course. 
And even after he became dean and Jack Case was

01:41.851 --> 01:50.619
director, all budget matters went through Fred. 
We went in with the joint budget of TTI, and civil

01:55.152 --> 02:00.000
engineering because he was responsible for all of 
those. And he made the final decisions, or at least

02:00.020 --> 02:13.160
asked questions such that you made the decision 
the way he would like to have it made, I think, in

02:00.020 --> 02:13.160
most of those cases. Did any key campus 
administrator in your memory ever question the

02:13.581 --> 02:22.695
importance of TTI?

02:26.843 --> 02:54.184
I know I can't immediately say, yes, it was Joe 
Smith that did this, but that we have had the

02:26.843 --> 02:54.184
question raised, and I don't know at what level or 
really the background behind it, but why should we

02:26.843 --> 02:54.184
be devoting particularly prior to this last 
legislative session, particularly to campus

02:26.843 --> 02:54.184
facilities, to an organization that really has no 
academic teaching responsibilities. And it's

03:02.501 --> 03:06.367
never been made a major issue. But up until the last 
session of the legislature, it was always sort of a

03:07.408 --> 03:13.658
little burr under the saddle there. Now, of 
course, we are getting appropriations directly

03:14.110 --> 03:21.682
to offset those, and it's a pass-through. We get 
the appropriation and pass it through to the

03:21.702 --> 03:28.454
university for facilities and maintenance and 
upkeep and all those sorts of things. All right.

03:28.814 --> 03:31.819
Today, TTI reports to whom? Today, the director 
reports directly to the chancellor. No to the

03:41.431 --> 03:46.760
minute they may have changed that.

03:57.399 --> 04:00.705
I think that I think that now and this has been 
quite. and I'm sorry to be vague on this, but I've

04:01.040 --> 04:05.625
been out of it now for a little while. I think now 
it's reporting to our vice president for

04:06.266 --> 04:13.694
engineering, which is also head of the T's. You 
mean vice chancellor? Vice chancellor, yeah.

04:19.440 --> 04:28.150
When did it become then a system component instead 
of a campus component? It was a system component in

04:28.671 --> 04:30.793
1950. Oh, so it always was. Always has been. Oh, 
okay. All right. Now, there were questions raised

04:35.489 --> 04:53.317
about that as to whether the board could 
officially designate, which they had done, could

04:35.489 --> 04:53.317
officially designate and create a system 
component for that action of the legislature. And

04:53.337 --> 04:56.342
that was resolved back in the 80s. Looking back, 
let's see, trace the directors who, after Keyes,

04:57.655 --> 05:04.584
who? Me. And you, what year? Well, Jack Keyes had a 
heart attack in the fall of 1975. I took over. Fred

05:14.778 --> 05:22.108
called me in and said, Jack's going to be out a year 
sort of helping run the place now. Do you want to

05:22.128 --> 05:25.452
continue doing that, and do you want me to change 
your title to interim director or something like

05:26.073 --> 05:51.220
that and i said the current title is fine i'm 
associate director at the time i didn't do

05:26.073 --> 05:51.220
everything i could do as interim i mean associate 
that i don't see any point in changes okay we'll

05:26.073 --> 05:51.220
just wait and change it in the next budget cycle so 
officially it was the uh then the beginning fall of

05:26.073 --> 05:51.220
76 until 93 had 17 years During those years, 
summarize how the employee workforce and the

05:52.043 --> 06:01.531
budget went from what to what. We started out, 
during those years, we had begun growing. And

06:10.078 --> 06:21.848
when I started my tenure as director, we probably 
had a budget of about $10 million a year, I would

06:10.078 --> 06:21.848
assume. uh when i retired we were at 39 million i 
believe so we agree we had a rather fast growth

06:22.891 --> 06:51.396
spurt uh primarily because opportunities were 
there and nothing brilliantly that i did to make

06:22.891 --> 06:51.396
that happen it's just that we had a bunch of good 
people and we had some good opportunities to to to

06:22.891 --> 06:51.396
get into some new areas that were growing areas 
such that we've had to accommodate a number of our

06:51.747 --> 06:56.833
people in off-campus lease space over the years. 
In fact, our new building that we just got built out

06:57.734 --> 07:12.092
here now, we took 34,000 square feet of lease space 
that moved all those people in this building out in

06:57.734 --> 07:12.092
the research park. So we were able to pay the 
building out of the most good part of the building

07:16.621 --> 07:23.048
cost out of that money we were paying for leases 
outside, and we'll have a building that leads

07:16.621 --> 07:23.048
through. So that's worked out very well. Of that, 
in your, that $39 million, about what percentage

07:25.250 --> 07:37.563
or what sum was private enterprise and what was 
state appropriation? Okay, two different,

07:37.583 --> 07:40.166
there's three different categories. Private 
enterprise, that is the private sector, very

07:40.486 --> 07:43.289
small. I'd say always in less than 10%. State 
appropriations running from 10 to 12%, and the

07:46.608 --> 07:55.680
rest of it all comes from other governmental 
sources. The Federal Highway Department,

07:56.582 --> 08:01.969
Federal Highway Administration, other states, 
their own state. But you all have to compete for

08:02.610 --> 08:04.873
that. Yes, that's all competitively bid contract 
research work. So that in terms of state

08:08.718 --> 08:15.147
appropriation, out of that $39-40 million, Four, 
five, six million were? Up until I retired, the

08:20.544 --> 08:28.972
biggest we'd ever gotten, I believe, was $1.2 
million of state appropriated money. And the

08:28.992 --> 08:30.354
employee workforce? It's about, well, our total, 
the number that we use now, this is about 650 now.

08:37.681 --> 08:46.230
But that includes about 250 students, about 
equally split between undergraduate and

08:37.681 --> 08:46.230
graduate students. most of them are majoring in? 
Well, you'd think they'd be majoring in civil

08:49.334 --> 08:52.178
engineering, but they're not. They're majoring 
in practically everything. Computer science,

08:53.920 --> 08:58.527
engineering's a big one, of course. We've got 
economists, economics in there. We've got a

09:01.030 --> 09:06.698
number of them from over in the social sciences. We 
do a lot of work

09:07.680 --> 09:15.711
in our roadside safety area about driver 
behavior. workload, this whole issue of talking

09:16.450 --> 09:26.368
on the frazzling telephone while you're driving 
down the road or looking at the onboard computer

09:16.450 --> 09:26.368
while you're driving down the road. So we have a 
number of human factors to graduate and

09:26.929 --> 09:33.481
undergraduate students as well. In your years as 
the director, summarize some of the work that you

09:36.127 --> 09:41.434
all did. Of all of the projects that you all did that 
you were closely involved in, of which ones are you

09:41.454 --> 09:49.303
most proud? I guess the first one, because it is so 
visible and is so intense in a way, is our roadside

09:50.805 --> 10:04.362
safety programs, where we have now developed 
roadside safety appurtenances materials that

10:05.303 --> 10:21.941
have saved literally thousands and tens of 
thousands of lives and untold economic benefits.

10:22.021 --> 10:28.408
We figured that about $7 billion worth of economic 
costs have been saved by people not getting killed

10:29.418 --> 10:43.636
and not getting seriously injured when they hit 
guardrails or run off the road in areas that are

10:29.418 --> 10:43.636
hitting one of the big overhead signpost 
structures that we've made breakaway and have

10:29.418 --> 10:43.636
treated safety. So we've been very proud of the 
work that we've done and are still developing that

10:43.737 --> 10:49.344
area, doing quite a bit of work. Another thing that 
we're very proud of in that area is that we, that is

10:50.225 --> 10:58.716
one of the few things that we've been able to take to 
the private sector and have them, through

10:59.050 --> 11:04.818
licensing agreements, we have licensed this 
technology. They're building it, putting it out

11:04.898 --> 11:12.508
on the roadway, and we get a very handsome royalty 
from that. So the money gets recycled. So we get to

11:14.450 --> 11:15.832
recycle the money. This year, last year, by the 
way, that's what I do now is handle intellectual

11:16.012 --> 11:21.680
property. So that's the one thing I can talk about 
currently. But last year, we made, in royalty

11:26.354 --> 11:33.484
payments, over $2.5 million off the oversight 
safety program. So of the current budget, 5%?

11:37.469 --> 11:39.452
Mm-hmm.

11:42.936 --> 11:49.425
All right, other projects that you're very proud 
to look back on and claim? I guess the other one

11:49.642 --> 12:07.207
would be it's not quite as visible, but the work 
that we've been doing and have become, I think,

11:49.642 --> 12:07.207
international leaders in is in the materials 
area, the roadway materials area more than

11:49.642 --> 12:07.207
anything else. Here we're trying to incorporate 
the chemical engineering profession into the

12:09.831 --> 12:16.881
civil engineering work of how do you characterize 
in a meaningful way the materials that you're

12:17.148 --> 12:43.172
putting into the roadway but in recent years we 
have found out that it's not only you know

12:17.148 --> 12:43.172
asphaltic roadway things not only the asphalt 
it's also the different kinds of aggregate you get

12:17.148 --> 12:43.172
one aggregate that's got certain 
characteristics it will interact in a horrible

12:17.148 --> 12:43.172
way with material with other with another set of 
characteristics so you have to be able to identify

12:43.895 --> 12:55.849
not only what you're putting in and the physical 
quality, but you have to get to the chemical

12:43.895 --> 12:55.849
quality of the interfaces of those different 
materials. And we've developed a lot of work in

12:55.869 --> 13:11.387
recycling old materials to use them, and 
sometimes they make even better roadways than you

12:55.869 --> 13:11.387
would make out of the original raw materials. What 
are the most interesting discoveries you all have

13:11.536 --> 13:17.526
made in those materials? Which would be the most 
surprising materials? I think the biggest one,

13:24.297 --> 13:29.466
because it's the biggest use that's been made out 
there, is in the asphalt area. And there, to

13:29.486 --> 13:38.100
characterize and to try to overcome the 
traditional... knowledge that everybody had

13:38.587 --> 14:07.800
that asphalt was a single material and the fact 
that if you took an eight physically we have always

13:38.587 --> 14:07.800
characterized asphalt by a number uh if it has a 
certain hardness and this is what they really go by

13:38.587 --> 14:07.800
it goes but get an ac5 and ac10 and ac20 each of those 
is a different hardness of asphalt and that means

13:38.587 --> 14:07.800
that it'll go through a tube under a certain set of 
temperatures and then a certain speed And if it's

14:08.303 --> 14:11.487
an AC-5, then you put it with these things. But what 
we've really found is that's not the case. That's

14:16.693 --> 14:19.357
not the problem that we're solving. We're trying 
to do it with physical measurements, and we have to

14:19.377 --> 14:25.124
do it with better measurements than we've ever 
done before. Because even though the Romans were

14:25.224 --> 14:35.016
able to build roadways that lasted forever, 
practically, they built it in a way that we can't

14:25.224 --> 14:35.016
afford to build them now. The Europeans are 
building roadways that are much better than we're

14:38.662 --> 15:08.365
doing because they have developed and again a very 
expensive process but one that lasts a long time

14:38.662 --> 15:08.365
it's a very good system where they contact 
aggregate on aggregate contact on larger

14:38.662 --> 15:08.365
aggregates and as long as you have the load bearing 
on a set of aggregates that are contacting another

14:38.662 --> 15:08.365
aggregate rather than a soft piece of asphalt it's 
not going to rut or ravel out like the other

14:38.662 --> 15:08.365
materials do we've not got it all incorporated 
into the construction processes, but not

15:09.931 --> 15:17.924
everybody, not all of the states really believe it 
yet. That's one of the things that's going to be, I

15:17.964 --> 15:23.894
think, a big lifesaver, because it's a money 
saver. All right, now let's go to the other

15:23.914 --> 15:25.557
extreme. Among the most frustrating efforts 
y'all have been involved in.

15:38.011 --> 15:46.063
Getting acceptance, I guess, of some of the human 
factors considerations in transportation. The

15:47.044 --> 16:00.945
whole issue of trying to marry technology with the 
ability of the human and its ability to assimilate

15:47.044 --> 16:00.945
and accumulate the knowledge that has been 
presented to them. Traditionally, you as a driver

16:01.786 --> 16:07.815
or I as a driver of an automobile going down the 
roadway, we're focused on The roadway itself, the

16:08.605 --> 16:25.209
oncoming vehicles, the conditions, whether it's 
raining or dry or whatever, but we're conditioned

16:08.605 --> 16:25.209
on a fairly narrow set of outside influences that 
we have to deal with. Now, you put an onboard

16:26.391 --> 16:37.768
computer in that's going to do all this marvelous 
stuff for you if you're lost and tell you where you

16:26.391 --> 16:37.768
are and how to get back to where you are. and give you 
a cell phone at the same time. I just saw an

16:42.546 --> 17:05.293
announcement or a statistic yesterday of a study 
that was done, I've forgotten exactly what it was

16:42.546 --> 17:05.293
now, but if you're using a cell phone in an 
automobile, your probability of being involved

16:42.546 --> 17:05.293
in a serious accident is 400% of what you would have 
without that. We've been believing that for a long

17:05.313 --> 17:07.536
time, And they've been involved in trying to get 
this human factor overload, or human overload,

17:08.360 --> 17:19.474
mental overload system recognized as a real 
problem. And I think it's not only a problem in

17:20.755 --> 17:26.883
automobile transportation, it's a problem in air 
transportation as well. I think they've

17:27.484 --> 17:30.267
recognized it a lot quicker than we have. Have 
there been any proposals, requests, suggestions

17:31.107 --> 17:38.456
to TTI that were truly goofy? Absolutely. Such as? 
We get solutions to problems all the time. We had a

17:46.165 --> 17:57.638
fellow from Houston that came up with a total set of 
drawings, all of which he had stamped as very

17:46.165 --> 17:57.638
private and confidential. really wanted us to 
sign a confidentiality agreement before we would

17:57.955 --> 18:03.961
look at them and we wouldn't do it. But when you 
opened it up and looked at what he was proposing, he

18:04.962 --> 18:15.332
was going to have a low friction transportation 
system in the city of Houston. He was going to have

18:16.413 --> 18:23.399
every roadway coming into the city of Houston 
built at a downward angle. And he was going to have a

18:23.419 --> 18:27.203
machine up here that built ice cubes And rather 
than having rolling rubber tires, you would put

18:28.668 --> 18:35.339
these ice cubes under your car and down that. And, 
you know, what sort of a nut house did this guy come

18:36.480 --> 18:42.770
out of? But those are, that's fairly extreme. But 
we do get, I'm looking at one right now where a

18:44.894 --> 18:53.507
fellow's got a new system for, he thinks, for the 
trucking industry. That...

18:57.828 --> 19:02.635
I think is a pipe dream of what he would like to do. 
It's segmenting the delivery system for goods

19:02.755 --> 19:06.200
movements. And what it ends up being is doing the 
same thing we're doing now already, except it's

19:07.062 --> 19:14.212
not patented materials. And so it's available to 
everybody. Every Safeway store has a system of

19:16.936 --> 19:24.608
moving from this warehouse to distributing their 
goods. And they worked on it for a long time. 50

19:27.848 --> 19:31.872
years to get it done right. You all have worked with 
a lot of corporations. I'm not going to ask the

19:35.196 --> 19:36.497
negative. Which corporations in TTI's work, to 
which corporations would you give the highest

19:36.877 --> 19:44.065
marks of excellence? I'd have to give it to Trinity 
Industries, which is a local Texas organization.

19:50.592 --> 19:55.577
And they are our primary licensee on our roadside 
safety work. They've done an excellent job. They

19:57.741 --> 20:00.084
partnered, they wanted to be partners with them. 
We have to, if anything, we have to sort of push them

20:00.104 --> 20:05.392
back and say, now we can't be that good a partner. I 
mean, that's strong a partner because there are

20:05.492 --> 20:14.745
certain things of competitive nature we have to 
assure that we're being fair to everyone else. But

20:14.765 --> 20:17.689
they have been a very good partner. They have 
been... not only accepting of what we do, but

20:21.983 --> 20:36.665
they've been participating and helping fund a lot 
of the stuff that we do, and for which they then

20:21.983 --> 20:36.665
compete for the license for. They do still have to 
compete for the licensing. And have you all done

20:40.571 --> 20:47.181
work for non-Texas, or is that not part of your 
charter? Oh, yeah, we do work for non non Texas. In

20:50.231 --> 20:54.957
fact, we do a lot a lot of work for other states.

20:57.881 --> 21:00.164
A lot of safety work for other states.

21:02.467 --> 21:09.035
We do a lot of federal work, not as much now as we did, 
say five years ago. Because We have never really

21:11.360 --> 21:19.287
gotten real good at the political process of 
earmarking funds at the federal level. And in the

21:19.308 --> 21:26.014
last two bills, that's been a really, really big 
problem. They come out with a great big research

21:26.554 --> 21:29.817
program and it's all earmarked. So much goes to 
Idaho, so much goes to, you know, set up a recycling

21:39.743 --> 21:46.995
center in, not in Connecticut, next state over. 
Rhode Island? Yeah, Rhode Island. But where they

21:49.559 --> 21:55.569
had no, they've had no experience at all in doing 
any of that sort of work. But they've set them up

21:55.589 --> 21:59.555
because of their strength of the political 
processes in Washington. And we've not been very

21:59.575 --> 22:01.178
good at that. Have there been any state or federal 
elected officials that have been particularly

22:01.681 --> 22:11.855
good friends of TTI?

22:16.862 --> 22:20.667
State officials, yes, they have. Our own 
officials have been very, very good to us. Are

22:25.173 --> 22:27.536
there some that deserve special mention? Well, I 
think that...

22:31.685 --> 22:39.114
to the extent that they can, and some of them are not 
in the positions yet to do so, that Ogden has been

22:31.685 --> 22:39.114
very interested in the work that we've done. 
Senator Steve Ogden. But go back in the past. Back

22:44.841 --> 22:51.789
in the past, Ray Barnhart was a very strong 
supporter. He became head of the Federal Highway

22:52.990 --> 22:55.613
Administration. Of course, Tiger Tate and Jake 
Pickle They were willing to support us and the

23:02.043 --> 23:10.031
University of Texas as long as we didn't get one 
really out of balance with the other. But Tiger was

23:11.993 --> 23:15.757
always a good, strong supporter of TTI. Has it made 
much difference in TTI's life whether there is a

23:16.478 --> 23:25.887
Democrat or Republican governor in Texas?

23:29.291 --> 23:30.632
Yes, it has. In recent years, I don't know how much 
to say about this. Well, who's been most

23:36.287 --> 23:38.249
supportive? We won't do the negative. The 
Republican Party has been much more supportive of

23:40.031 --> 23:52.047
the research program and of the overall need for 
transportation research and

23:40.031 --> 23:52.047
transportation-related work in the 
transportation system. Now, Kay Bailey

23:53.048 --> 24:01.159
Hutchison, Senator Hutchison at the federal 
level, has been a good friend and... I mean, we

24:02.405 --> 24:11.433
don't have a whole bunch of stuff sitting on our 
desk of request, and Phil Graham has. To the extent

24:11.453 --> 24:32.412
that Phil is not normally, Senator Graham is not 
normally one who says, yes, I will go in and support

24:11.453 --> 24:32.412
this, and regardless of the cost of the program, 
you know, it's, well, I don't really like to put the

24:11.453 --> 24:32.412
federal money in it, but if there's any that comes 
into it, I'll sure try to see you get your share of it

24:11.453 --> 24:32.412
sort of approach. All right, as you look back on all 
these years, what were your proudest, with TTI,

24:32.982 --> 24:40.473
what were your proudest moments?

24:45.040 --> 24:58.139
Mostly I think it's been things

24:45.040 --> 24:58.139
that other people have done, really, that have 
been associated with TTI. We've had some very,

24:59.180 --> 25:02.365
very excellent people that have gotten awards for 
activities that they've been involved in or

25:02.783 --> 25:11.832
developments or research that they have done. We 
have some aboard now, like we started the Center

25:12.192 --> 25:17.197
for Aggregate Research. This is one of those areas 
to talk about. And Dr. Dallas Little is a professor

25:18.999 --> 25:32.031
of civil engineering and has been one of our 
employees for 20-something years and is an

25:18.999 --> 25:32.031
absolutely outstanding young man, or not young 
man. Of course, to me, he's still a young man, but

25:32.686 --> 25:37.634
he's done a great work. Dr. Hirsch, Teddy Hirsch, 
has done some excellent work that's gotten some

25:38.556 --> 25:50.156
real recognition on the work that he's done in the 
roadside safety area. Developed the first

25:50.917 --> 25:58.710
breakaway highway sign work that was a real killer 
and was almost immediately adopted by the Federal

25:59.247 --> 26:06.654
Highway Administration as a requirement on all 
interstate roads. So we've had some really good

26:07.155 --> 26:14.903
work done that I've been very proud that our people 
have been involved in and they've done. If you were

26:16.645 --> 26:26.014
looking back on all these years related to A&M, 
whether with TTI or not, we're on the downhill

26:16.645 --> 26:26.014
slope now. To whom would you feel greatest 
appreciation? If everybody could walk in the room

26:31.294 --> 26:35.839
from those years, whom would you want to thank 
most? Obviously, one of the first ones would be

26:36.600 --> 26:39.163
Fred Benson.

26:42.086 --> 26:56.642
I always admired Fred's forthrightness and his 
ability to cut to the heart of the matter and his

26:42.086 --> 26:56.642
willingness to make decisions and stand by and 
make decisions when It might be more convenient to

26:57.449 --> 27:02.897
form a committee to make the decision for you. Of 
course, in one of the cases when he hired me as

27:03.578 --> 27:25.752
director, appointed to move me up as director,

27:03.578 --> 27:25.752
his total interviewing process was, Jack Case is 
gone, I'd like to be, you'd be the new director.

27:29.225 --> 27:30.406
Would you like to have a job? And I said, yes, he 
said, okay, we'll start it first. And that was, I

27:32.828 --> 27:44.779
mean, we didn't go through a committee and didn't 
have to have a whole lot of other people's input. He

27:44.819 --> 27:52.045
knew what he wanted to do and how he wanted to do it 
and was willing to do it on his own, on his own

27:44.819 --> 27:52.045
responsibility. Today, we take six months. Don't 
we? Haskell, we are killing ourselves. We are

27:57.861 --> 28:00.004
absolutely killing ourselves. And the end result 
is not as skillfully done. You're absolutely

28:04.590 --> 28:05.692
right. What you get is, you may not want this, but in 
my view, what we do, we form committees to go in. We

28:15.706 --> 28:18.850
make the poor candidate come in and go through this 
committee. What you're looking for is how many

28:19.831 --> 28:22.435
negatives do you get. And if you don't like this and 
you don't like that, pretty soon you get down to

28:23.478 --> 28:32.713
somebody down here where nobody finds anything 
they don't like about him, but there's nothing

28:23.478 --> 28:32.713
really good about him either. They're 
comparatively bland. They're right. It's

28:35.017 --> 28:36.599
absolutely right. All right, other people that 
you'd want to thank beyond Fred Benson? Well, of

28:41.146 --> 28:43.250
course, the old-timers. Mr. Gilchrist, of 
course, because of his longstanding...

28:50.073 --> 29:20.080
involvement and leadership in this in this whole 
area jack keese jack keese was a good leader jack

28:50.073 --> 29:20.080
keese was a better leader he was he was a good 
researcher but he was primarily a leader instead

28:50.073 --> 29:20.080
of a researcher and i think he did his best work that 
way so i never want to thank i want to thank him in

29:21.865 --> 29:29.416
Well, of course, there's a whole bunch of other 
people that I think have done an excellent job as

29:21.865 --> 29:29.416
far as their involvement with TTI. But I'm 
thinking about it up in the system and university

29:29.457 --> 29:38.070
level, or university system level. Those are the 
two primary ones. I'm sure I'm leaving out

29:41.761 --> 29:46.269
somebody that I just can't think of at the moment. 
And the chancellors from the time the system is

29:46.289 --> 30:06.385
recreated with following William's heart 
attack, which of those chancellors, I'm not going

29:46.289 --> 30:06.385
to ask the negative ghetto, which of those 
chancellors would you give the highest marks to?

30:09.200 --> 30:11.342
We're talking about from roughly 77 to now. 77 to 
the time I, yeah.

30:22.934 --> 30:28.961
Now, right now, down to the point, I'm having a hard 
time remembering who were the names. Well, Hubert

30:29.601 --> 30:32.424
Mobley.

30:35.908 --> 30:38.110
Frank Hubert was a good one. a supporter of ours, 
and was trying to, I think he tried to be helpful in

30:38.275 --> 30:46.326
every way he could. I mean, he was never anything 
negative. I'm trying to think who after Mobley,

30:48.590 --> 30:59.585
was there anybody between Mobley and Thompson?

30:59.605 --> 31:00.667
I don't think so. Oh, okay. I've got my list in there 
somewhere. But, and of course, I've always had a

31:03.951 --> 31:08.097
high respect for Mobley. For Thompson, he did not 
have a whole lot to do with TTI, but at the time he was

31:08.448 --> 31:16.780
in there, he was a strong supporter of TTI. He 
particularly liked that we were trying to do

31:18.422 --> 31:25.933
something practical and helpful for the people 
who were trying to serve in the state of Texas.
