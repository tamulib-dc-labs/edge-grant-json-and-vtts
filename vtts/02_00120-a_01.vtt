00:02.444 --> 00:26.207
March the 25th or 6th 27th sitting at 800 Delma Street in Bryan chatting with one of the truly distinguished members of the chemistry faculty whom all of us knew knew is Dr. Tex Isbell check your mic no just say something one two three how's that

00:32.043 --> 00:46.889
Let's begin this story of your experience here with your giving a brief autobiographical summary of your experience before you came to A&M.

00:46.949 --> 00:51.317
Where were you born, grew up, go to college, mom and dad and all that.

00:52.985 --> 01:04.542
Haskell, I was born in Lubbock, Texas, although my father was a Baptist minister and actually lived in Rawls.

01:04.822 --> 01:09.750
But Lubbock was the nearest place where there was a hospital in those days.

01:10.190 --> 01:15.859
And so that's where I was born in 1917, February 12, 1917.

01:16.560 --> 01:22.148
Always been proud of the date because it was Abe Lincoln's birthday also.

01:22.128 --> 01:51.139
A year after my birth in 1918, my father came down with the terrible flu epidemic and it went into tuberculosis and he was never able to get rid of that because there was really no good medical treatment for it in those days.

01:51.119 --> 02:11.440
He lived for another ten years, but in the meantime, we moved to San Antonio where I grew up my first nine years.

02:12.787 --> 02:20.708
Early days were not very pleasant because we were pretty destitute.

02:22.293 --> 02:28.028
He could not hold a job of any kind.

02:29.122 --> 02:41.894
There were days when we literally didn't have anything in the house for the next meal, and then, amazingly enough, a friend would drive by with three or four sacks of groceries.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.763
I don't know how we survived, but we did.

02:47.853 --> 03:00.249
When he died in 1928, my mother was left with me, the older child, and two younger sisters.

03:01.731 --> 03:08.660
And she had some early training and a little bit of college.

03:11.403 --> 03:15.008
She was a good speaker.

03:14.988 --> 03:21.477
and so she taught speech and acting and things like that.

03:22.638 --> 03:37.738
She was able to get a job in 1928 at San Marcos Baptist Academy in San Marcos, Texas as a speech teacher.

03:38.647 --> 03:45.596
That was not a great experience either because the Depression was coming on.

03:45.636 --> 03:54.268
San Marcos Academy was a private prep school type operation.

03:54.328 --> 04:05.363
Most of their students came from West Texas ranches and farms and from families

04:05.343 --> 04:14.876
who had broken up and neither parent really wanted to take any responsibility for the youngsters, so they sent them there.

04:15.717 --> 04:17.760
So we had some pretty interesting kids there.

04:19.943 --> 04:27.773
I graduated from high school in 1933 at San Marcos Academy, and it was

04:28.867 --> 04:32.490
as bad a time during the Depression as I can remember.

04:32.550 --> 04:49.285
And we were truly destitute, so my mother had a younger sister who had married a farmer, a very good farmer, who lived about seven miles out of the town of Hollis, Oklahoma.

04:50.386 --> 04:56.612
And they wrote us and said, come on up to Hollis,

04:57.132 --> 05:09.002
we don't have any money but we have all the food that anybody needs to eat we can raise on our farm so you won't starve and that's what we did.

05:09.082 --> 05:14.415
We went up there about the first of June and I worked on a farm up there and

05:14.395 --> 05:17.743
I learned that I really didn't like farming that much.

05:19.768 --> 05:29.653
But in any event, when I graduated from high school, I wanted to be a chemist.

05:29.633 --> 05:37.585
received a Gilbert chemistry set from a favorite uncle in San Antonio.

05:39.188 --> 05:58.577
At Christmas around 1926, I was nine years old so I could get the date down a little more precisely than that, but in any event, I was literally turned on by that chemistry set.

06:00.160 --> 06:08.415
I would go around and pick up colored rocks and wondered why some rocks were red and some were blue and things like that.

06:08.615 --> 06:11.000
I knew it was the chemistry and the rocks.

06:11.661 --> 06:20.076
I didn't know what chemists did, but I was convinced that they must have a great fun in their lives.

06:20.056 --> 06:30.711
And so that's what I wanted to do, but when I graduated from high school in 1933, I had absolutely no hopes of ever going to college.

06:32.093 --> 06:44.089
And so in the following fall, around January 1st of 1934,

06:44.069 --> 06:56.509
I received a letter, a surprising letter, from the president of Baylor University, Pat M. Neff.

06:58.413 --> 07:09.448
Pat Neff and my father had grown up on adjacent farms in Coriel County, literally adjacent farms.

07:09.568 --> 07:17.258
They were close friends, had gone to school together even a couple, three years at Baylor.

07:17.879 --> 07:26.530
My dad went on from there to the Southwestern Theological Seminary, and I don't know whether he graduated from Baylor or not, but

07:26.510 --> 07:47.906
In any event, he and Pat Neff were close friends, and Neff had heard from one of my aunts, who was also of course a close friend, that I had graduated from high school and wanted in the worst way to go to college, but had no idea that I could ever get there.

07:48.628 --> 07:50.070
His letter said to me,

07:51.451 --> 07:54.917
I understand you would like to go to college.

07:55.057 --> 07:57.140
I will offer you something.

07:57.160 --> 08:06.996
You can come to Baylor University if that's where you would like to attend college.

08:08.123 --> 08:23.753
I will see to it that you get all the work that you need to do to work your way through Baylor, and whether you make it or not will be entirely up to you.

08:26.095 --> 08:53.689
So Baylor was on the trimester system at that time, and so at the beginning of the third trimester, third quarter actually, I guess it would be that year, sometime in February, I went to Baylor and matriculated.

08:56.555 --> 09:02.468
I was the only chemistry major in those days at Baylor's, to the best of my knowledge.

09:03.249 --> 09:16.538
Baylor had a good med school, and so they had, I guess, pretty good biology and chemistry pre-med courses.

09:16.518 --> 09:24.866
The chemistry courses were not designed for chemistry majors, and the net result was I had a great time there.

09:25.267 --> 09:32.214
I was a laboratory instructor for a couple of years.

09:32.674 --> 09:37.579
I did about every kind of job on the Baylor campus you could do.

09:37.599 --> 09:41.243
I was the night telephone

09:41.560 --> 09:50.423
switchboard operator for a while because the switchboard was located in the old science building and after six o'clock

09:50.639 --> 10:01.777
There was nobody over there, and they didn't allow the girls to go over there and work until the telephone was turned off at 10, so I would go over there and operate the switchboard.

10:02.639 --> 10:09.910
I even posed in the art department, semi-nude, things of that sort.

10:10.211 --> 10:14.638
The Good Baptist didn't know that for a long time.

10:15.665 --> 10:27.147
Anyway, I managed to get through Baylor and graduated from there in May, about the 1st of June of 1937.

10:27.467 --> 10:35.142
Again, a terrible year of the Depression.

10:36.353 --> 10:50.262
I thought for a while that since I was getting a bachelor's degree in chemistry, there would be all kinds of employers that would be looking to hire me.

10:50.765 --> 10:51.747
It wasn't true.

10:53.210 --> 11:04.812
I sent out about 40 letters inquiring about jobs to every chemical type company in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.

11:05.834 --> 11:07.457
Got back, I think, five

11:08.197 --> 11:12.766
replies that said they had nothing and the rest of the people didn't reply.

11:12.806 --> 11:23.788
When I graduated, I had $25 that this favorite uncle had given me, that had given me the chemistry set.

11:25.412 --> 11:29.580
He claimed that it was the last bit of my father's

11:29.560 --> 11:32.212
but that wasn't true, and I knew it.

11:33.377 --> 11:38.862
He was doing what he could to help me out, and that's all the money I had.

11:40.023 --> 11:42.808
I looked for a job for four months.

11:43.970 --> 11:51.363
I hitchhiked all over Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, slept under bridges and culverts.

11:52.325 --> 12:00.238
Looking back, I have no idea how I survived for four months on $25, but I did.

12:02.042 --> 12:04.005
I did because I didn't have any choice.

12:05.723 --> 12:17.224
Finally, I was able on the 1st of October to start work in Dallas at First Texas Chemical Manufacturing Company, and I was their only chemist.

12:17.384 --> 12:19.167
I analyzed their products.

12:19.588 --> 12:23.996
They were a pharmaceutical manufacturing company.

12:25.519 --> 12:29.706
I worked there for a year and a half,

12:31.255 --> 12:35.360
at the magnificent starting salary of $100 a month.

12:36.161 --> 12:43.230
In the second year, they raised me to $125 a month, which, after all, was a 25% increase.

12:43.891 --> 12:59.170
But I was doing all I could to survive living in the YMCA and sending my mother and two sisters all the money that I didn't absolutely have to have to survive.

13:01.040 --> 13:23.385
I was trying my best to figure out some way to get into graduate school because during that summer when I was looking for a job unsuccessfully, I walked into the mobile oil company headquarters in Dallas and walked into the office where they hired people.

13:23.365 --> 13:33.427
and told this gentleman that I was a graduate of Baylor with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and I would like to work for a mobile oil company.

13:34.289 --> 13:39.501
He looked at me for a little while without saying anything and then he said,

13:41.084 --> 13:52.802
Young man, let me tell you, if you had a PhD in chemistry, I would probably hire you because there are not many PhD chemists these days.

13:53.663 --> 13:58.350
If you had a master's degree, I would talk to you maybe.

13:58.391 --> 14:03.919
We might be able to find some place for you, but with only a bachelor's degree,

14:04.270 --> 14:09.099
they're a dime a dozen, don't waste my time, and I won't waste yours.

14:09.880 --> 14:13.647
And so I found out that day what I absolutely had to do.

14:13.667 --> 14:16.993
I had to figure out some way to get to graduate school.

14:19.577 --> 14:28.573
That, the fall of 1938,

14:29.971 --> 14:42.333
A friend of mine in Dallas who had graduated from the University of Texas took me to Austin over the Thanksgiving holidays that he was going to spend with his two parents.

14:42.353 --> 14:52.992
While there, I went to the chemistry department and talked to the acting head of the chemistry department whose name was Henry Rudolph Henze.

14:52.972 --> 15:05.858
All the four profs that had made the University of Texas chemistry department the best chemistry department in the South in those days, all of them were Germans.

15:07.201 --> 15:08.584
Tough old Germans.

15:08.564 --> 15:15.774
And I said, I want to go to graduate school, but I have no money.

15:15.814 --> 15:23.865
Is there some way I can go to the University of Texas graduate school in the chemistry department?

15:23.885 --> 15:28.131
He said, well, I'm sorry to tell you this.

15:28.832 --> 15:36.883
We have teaching assistant jobs that we give to graduate students here, but they are all, have already been

15:36.863 --> 15:40.709
allocated for next fall.

15:40.889 --> 15:41.850
There are none.

15:43.893 --> 15:50.704
And I guess he saw my face fall pretty badly and he said, but I'll make a deal with you.

15:51.825 --> 15:53.708
If you really want to come here,

15:55.409 --> 16:02.678
We have two courses that all graduates, entering graduate students must take and pass.

16:03.900 --> 16:09.287
They are technique courses that all chemists need when they go into a research laboratory.

16:09.827 --> 16:24.606
The first is called organic qualitative analysis where you identify unknown compounds and the second is organic qualitative analysis where you need to learn to do all the

16:24.940 --> 16:30.506
analytical procedures for determining the structure of a compound.

16:31.667 --> 16:52.028
And he said, if you make A's in both of these courses, and in September there happens to be the need for another laboratory instructor in freshman chemistry, you get the job.

16:53.695 --> 17:05.935
And I said, I'll be here on the first of June because I figured I had no choice again.

17:10.262 --> 17:15.130
It turned out that my chemistry background at Baylor was atrocious.

17:16.561 --> 17:29.929
He, my first professor that summer, taught both courses, was an old German from Fredericksburg who had never learned to speak English at all, really.

17:29.949 --> 17:36.983
And it took me two months to learn to decipher his Germanic English.

17:38.077 --> 17:43.472
And then he was talking about, found out that he was talking about things that I had never heard of before.

17:43.612 --> 17:48.084
And I would turn to a student next to me and say, do you know what he's talking about?

17:48.185 --> 17:53.098
Oh yes, we had that at LSU or we had that at Georgia Tech.

17:53.078 --> 18:03.769
and I found out that I was in bad trouble, so I would, at the end of each of those classes, the class met every day, a lecture from 11 till 12.

18:03.990 --> 18:17.584
I then ate my lunch from 1 o'clock until whenever we worked in the laboratory that summer, learning to do these analytical procedures.

18:19.117 --> 18:34.003
So I would run into the library, chemistry library, they had one in the chemistry building, after every lecture and read up on some books to find out what I should have known, but didn't know.

18:35.232 --> 18:40.018
So that summer was tough, and I had to make A's in those two courses.

18:40.900 --> 18:53.196
And I never went back to my room before 12 o'clock at night, and there were nights that I stayed up there working until 2 o'clock.

18:55.479 --> 19:00.666
And then in the middle of the summer, something that unexpected happened to me.

19:03.042 --> 19:12.816
A man who was employed by the Southern Regional Research Laboratories in New Orleans dropped by.

19:13.457 --> 19:23.110
He had known me because he came by and picked up samples when I worked in Dallas for the pharmaceutical company.

19:23.596 --> 19:35.523
And it was their job to ride herd on us to be sure that we were not putting out products that contain the wrong amount of ingredient.

19:35.623 --> 19:42.178
And mainly these products that they were analyzing and were concerned about were

19:42.715 --> 19:53.609
were the hypodermic tablets, strychnine, morphine, codeine, and things like that.

19:54.131 --> 19:55.054
So he knew me.

19:56.418 --> 20:20.974
And we'd gotten to be fairly friendly and he dropped by at the end of this first course at the University of Texas and called me up and said, I have a job to offer you at Southern Regional Research Laboratories and it pays $2,400 a year.

20:21.578 --> 20:30.947
which I didn't know anybody made, and we would like for you to accept the job.

20:32.513 --> 20:38.544
And I said, how much time do I have to give you an answer?

20:39.546 --> 20:41.610
He said, well, I'll be here for 24 hours.

20:41.670 --> 20:43.313
I'll call you 24 hours later.

20:43.333 --> 20:44.876
And he did.

20:44.936 --> 20:48.302
He said, OK, what's your answer?

20:48.322 --> 20:50.406
And I said, I'm going to turn your job down.

20:50.466 --> 20:56.597
It was not easy to do because I badly need

20:56.577 --> 20:58.881
money to survive.

21:00.223 --> 21:06.854
But I know if I ever leave the University of Texas graduate school, I'll never get back.

21:07.615 --> 21:08.437
And so I did.

21:08.457 --> 21:14.166
I made an A in the first course and I made an A in the second course.

21:15.328 --> 21:18.433
I was not going to make anything less than that.

21:21.704 --> 21:31.981
And the head of the chemistry department, Dr. Henze, called me into his office and said, I have a job for you.

21:32.001 --> 21:36.408
And we needed another person to teach freshman laboratories.

21:38.371 --> 21:39.613
And no, that was not true.

21:41.296 --> 21:47.526
These two tough old Germans, Henze and Lochte, had gotten together and said, I'm sure.

21:48.890 --> 21:51.733
here's this crazy kid here working his tail off.

21:54.156 --> 21:57.459
He needs to get into graduate school.

21:57.520 --> 22:02.625
Let's make it possible for him to do it by creating another section of freshman chemistry.

22:03.466 --> 22:09.873
I accused him of that later, much later, and they both denied it, but I know it was true.

22:12.736 --> 22:13.277
So,

22:14.860 --> 22:19.929
I got my masters in 41 and my PhD in 43.

22:19.949 --> 22:25.198
In 42, I married my wonderful wife, Edith.

22:26.441 --> 22:34.455
She was a microbiologist and was a very beautiful lady.

22:34.435 --> 22:43.901
the best dancer I've ever danced with in my life, and an exceedingly smart young lady.

22:44.924 --> 22:48.394
Smartest thing I ever did in life was to marry Edith.

22:50.450 --> 22:53.734
A year later, I got my Ph.D.

22:55.576 --> 23:11.095
in 1943, and I accepted a job which were— the war was on, and jobs suddenly were— I had 15 offers of jobs at that time.

23:11.895 --> 23:17.402
I accepted a job with General Mills Research Laboratories in Minneapolis, Minnesota,

23:19.424 --> 23:29.481
Because we were just curious about—we both were native Texans, never been out of the state, and decided to see what other part of the world looked like.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.226
And it was a fortunate decision.

23:33.067 --> 23:38.496
I worked for General Mills for seven years until 1950.

23:38.476 --> 23:42.200
They treated me exceedingly well.

23:43.502 --> 23:46.665
I was a successful chemist for them.

23:47.887 --> 23:58.419
I produced, among other things, the first truly synthetic detergent that was ever developed.

23:59.420 --> 24:01.142
I have three patents on it.

24:02.540 --> 24:18.793
General Mills had decided that they wanted a chemistry division to develop ways to use their waste products in their milling operations, but they were a food company.

24:18.773 --> 24:23.401
An excellent food company, they knew nothing about chemistry.

24:24.322 --> 24:32.917
And when I produced this unique synthetic detergent, they didn't know how to market it.

24:33.718 --> 24:35.601
It sat on a shelf.

24:35.581 --> 24:46.854
until about two years after I left there, around 1952 or 53, it suddenly occurred to me, gee, maybe we should put this product on the market.

24:47.375 --> 24:58.247
But it was too late, really, because they had lost the advantage of a rather remarkable product.

25:00.016 --> 25:06.967
I could see that although I enjoyed my work up there, I could see that I was in the wrong place.

25:08.109 --> 25:15.702
And I didn't much care for the long Minnesota winters.

25:15.722 --> 25:25.838
And so I obtained a job in Memphis, Tennessee in a small specialty chemical company.

25:26.273 --> 25:33.240
where I worked for two years and it was the only job I ever had that I really didn't like.

25:33.260 --> 25:41.928
Everybody, in my opinion, should have one job they don't like to be able to appreciate the good jobs they have.

25:45.392 --> 25:53.800
At the end of the year and a half, I was contacted by Monsanto Chemical Company

25:54.607 --> 26:00.797
They had just gotten a contract from what was then called the U.S.

26:00.817 --> 26:16.443
Chemical Corps to do, of all things, develop a large-scale commercial synthesis of nerve gas.

26:16.804 --> 26:18.707
During World War II,

26:20.138 --> 26:33.104
The American forces, the Allied forces, had picked up a couple of barges of nerve gas on the Rhine and knew what it was, but it was a very, very strange chemical.

26:36.050 --> 26:42.282
The Russians had captured all the German scientists and had taken them to Russia and

26:42.802 --> 26:53.233
By 1950, they were telling the US military, we have nerve gas and you guys better shape up or else.

26:54.378 --> 27:11.487
This was a rush project, and I was picked because I was told by the people Monsanto had contacted at General Mills Research Laboratories.

27:12.609 --> 27:18.900
They told Monsanto that I was an excellent experimental chemist, and I was.

27:21.513 --> 27:28.384
So I went to Monsanto on September 1st of 1951.

27:30.592 --> 27:33.736
and this contract was for one year.

27:35.298 --> 27:38.301
We hadn't the foggiest idea how to make this compound.

27:40.164 --> 27:46.331
There was a little bit of literature on the generals.

27:46.551 --> 28:00.328
These were compounds that contained a phosphorus atom attached to carbon, a carbon, and these so-called organophosphorus compounds no one in this country had ever worked on.

28:01.338 --> 28:10.189
And so there was very little known and we sat, there were 12 of us in this project.

28:11.571 --> 28:23.886
And the surprising thing to me was that when I arrived in Anniston, Alabama, where this work was to be done, one of their Monsanto's division laboratories,

28:25.773 --> 28:44.980
I found that there were a total of 12 people that were going to work on this project, and they, two of the supervisors of the project had been Monsanto employees for a number of years.

28:45.432 --> 28:51.619
and within a week I found out that I was the third supervisor and that we would work together.

28:52.800 --> 28:56.384
Sounded like a bit of a strange arrangement, but it was not.

28:57.145 --> 29:01.871
These two other people that I worked with were excellent chemists.

29:02.531 --> 29:04.013
They were theoretical chemists.

29:04.053 --> 29:11.001
They were not very good in the laboratory, but they also knew how to work with people, and the three of us

29:11.622 --> 29:17.328
divided up the job and worked together remarkably well.

29:19.270 --> 29:33.004
I won't go into all of that story except to say that we had come up with, we did not have to make the final product which is commonly called sarin, S-A-R-I-N.

29:34.846 --> 29:39.891
It is exceedingly toxic, one milligram

29:40.867 --> 29:48.816
If it just gets on your clothes, it will go through an intact scan and you will be dead in a very short time.

29:49.417 --> 29:58.227
If you inhale a small amount of the vapor, it's like somebody hits you over the head with a cement post.

29:59.288 --> 30:08.038
You go down and unless somebody can get an anecdote to you, within 30 seconds you're dead.

30:09.841 --> 30:23.439
We had the anecdote which is atropine solution in hypodermics around the laboratory and we knew how to use them if necessary.

30:23.559 --> 30:24.401
We never had to.

30:25.362 --> 30:26.884
We knew what we were working with.

30:27.465 --> 30:30.068
We never had to make the final product though.

30:30.849 --> 30:32.912
We finally came up with

30:33.314 --> 30:45.977
four steps to get from readily available starting materials to the final product sarin, but the last step was already known.

30:46.679 --> 30:49.905
It could be carried out in a quantitative yield.

30:50.366 --> 30:51.488
We didn't have to do that.

30:52.289 --> 30:53.331
We did have to get

30:53.868 --> 31:11.433
the product of the third step, and all of these products were, all of these steps, we were told, had to be carried out in a continuous flow method and give at least 95 percent yields.

31:11.453 --> 31:22.609
So those were pretty hard things to come by, but we spent a lot of time on the first step.

31:25.002 --> 31:28.205
and a fair amount of time on the second step.

31:29.846 --> 31:38.434
We only had three steps, but when we had completed our work on the second step, we only had two weeks to go.

31:41.357 --> 31:49.264
I thought there was no hopes of doing the third step.

31:49.584 --> 31:52.967
We sat around in the laboratory, all 12 of us,

31:54.078 --> 32:16.204
tossed ideas around and finally decided that what we needed to do was to replace a propoxy group, if you know what that is, with a chlorine atom.

32:16.555 --> 32:19.258
attached, and these were attached to the phosphorus atom.

32:20.039 --> 32:22.962
There were two propoxy groups on the phosphorus atom.

32:22.982 --> 32:28.629
We had to knock off one of these and replace it with one chlorine atom, no more.

32:30.651 --> 32:45.668
The product, the chlorine product containing product, was about 1,000th as toxic as sarin, and so we were, the last product we were

32:46.222 --> 32:50.186
would be working with would be an exceedingly toxic chemical too.

32:52.769 --> 32:58.475
We finally decided on a procedure and I won't go into details on that.

32:58.555 --> 33:14.912
We had a liquid that we had to introduce a reagent into to carry out this transformation, this replacement of a isopropoxy group with a chlorine atom.

33:16.529 --> 33:35.398
We finally decided that the reagent we would try would be phosgene, an exceedingly toxic chemical itself, but we had it piped into all of our fume hoods in the laboratories there because this laboratory

33:35.902 --> 33:51.987
worked on isocyanates and isocyanate resins and these required phosgene and so we were equipped with phosgene and we thought that this reagent might just work.

33:54.312 --> 34:12.962
I was selected to carry out the experiment, so I bubbled phosgene into a flask of this other reagent for about an hour and weighed the flask and only a small amount of phosgene had dissolved.

34:14.545 --> 34:29.825
And I had developed a little device in the laboratories, General Mills' laboratories, that was an exceedingly efficient device for dissolving gases and liquids.

34:29.865 --> 34:39.338
So I pulled, went in the laboratory, or the glass-blowing room, and made one of these small ones, and put it in this flask.

34:39.757 --> 34:52.097
and inside of 30 minutes I had dissolved exactly the right amount of phosgene in this flask, in this other chemical.

34:52.438 --> 34:55.823
Let it stand overnight, distilled it the next day.

34:55.843 --> 35:06.000
I recovered a 96% yield of the pure material, having the chlorine atom

35:07.617 --> 35:10.987
on the phosphorus atom in the right place.

35:12.672 --> 35:21.458
In one experiment, fortunately, we solved a problem about two weeks before our project was over.

35:24.577 --> 35:29.187
I can only look back on that as a truly remarkable thing.

35:29.367 --> 35:31.131
I don't take any credit for it.

35:31.872 --> 35:43.737
I happen to have the little device that allowed me to dissolve the phosgene in the other reagent, but the rest of it just turned out serendipitously.

35:43.877 --> 35:45.100
That's all I can say.

35:47.189 --> 35:58.527
But, and so I stayed on, when that project was over, I stayed on and worked at Monsanto for an additional year, and I would like to have continued working for them.

35:58.547 --> 36:12.268
They were a good company, they treated me well, but they came to me one day and said, you have received the last promotion and the last raise you can receive and still stay in the laboratory.

36:12.957 --> 36:26.635
You have to accept a desk job and we are offering you a job as assistant or associate director of research.

36:26.655 --> 36:31.982
I didn't want to be anything but a laboratory chemist.

36:32.003 --> 36:33.885
That's all I've ever wanted to be.

36:36.228 --> 36:50.592
I had also heard that the Monsanto at that time had decided to move all of their outlying divisional laboratories into their central headquarters in St.

36:50.652 --> 36:56.602
Louis, and it was located in a very poor part of St.

36:56.642 --> 36:58.185
Louis.

36:58.165 --> 37:13.853
I didn't want to go up there, and I had been thinking, you know, I've done all the things as an industrial chemist that I had sort of set out to do.

37:13.873 --> 37:16.739
I've accomplished all my objectives.

37:17.320 --> 37:21.928
It might be fun to try my hand at teaching at a university.

37:22.972 --> 37:29.123
and so I applied for a number at a number of places and was accepted at A&M.

37:31.908 --> 37:43.950
The department head was Fred Jensen, and he wrote me a letter saying, you have been hired,

37:44.470 --> 38:05.145
to be an assistant professor of chemistry at A&M starting in the fall of 1953, and I showed the letter to my wife, and she wandered off without saying anything, and for about an hour later she came back and said,

38:06.070 --> 38:13.499
It never occurred to me that our two boys would turn out to be Aggies.

38:13.519 --> 38:17.083
She being a good T-sip.

38:17.363 --> 38:19.566
What was the pay in that first job?

38:19.586 --> 38:25.213
$4,500 for nine months and no summer job at all.

38:26.374 --> 38:29.057
And I was making $10,000 the last

38:29.729 --> 38:33.717
year at Monsanto plus a $500 bonus.

38:34.719 --> 38:40.812
So this this was a serious step down, not for me, for my family.

38:41.493 --> 38:48.548
They had to suffer much the loss of a lot of

38:48.528 --> 38:57.558
income, I was going to do the things that I thought I wanted to do by trying to become a professor of chemistry.

38:58.700 --> 39:04.386
That first summer I was at A&M, I was able to get a job.

39:04.406 --> 39:08.131
I had no income at all in the summertime.

39:08.151 --> 39:13.136
I was able to get a job at the American Oil Company laboratories in Texas City.

39:13.176 --> 39:14.518
They were kind enough

39:14.853 --> 39:19.640
to offer me a pretty good paying job there for the summer.

39:20.841 --> 39:25.949
And so that's the way we survived that first year.

39:26.670 --> 39:44.775
By the second year, I had received a Welch grant which allowed me to pay myself a summer job to direct my research activities.

39:46.578 --> 39:53.132
But it took me five years, as I recall, to get back to the salary I had.

39:53.152 --> 39:55.858
I was making it at Monsanto when I left there.

39:56.981 --> 40:01.611
Describe the department when you arrived, the Department of Chemistry.

40:02.192 --> 40:02.873
Who was here?

40:02.934 --> 40:03.936
Where was it?

40:04.377 --> 40:05.920
What were the facilities and so forth?

40:06.963 --> 40:20.676
Well, they were in the present chemistry building, although there have been at least three major additions to it since that time.

40:20.736 --> 40:33.949
The old chemistry building was just a rectangular building that actually faced a fountain.

40:34.418 --> 40:40.125
and all the additions have been put on the back side of that building.

40:40.606 --> 40:48.516
It's got to be at least four times bigger now than it was at that time.

40:50.759 --> 40:53.082
The department was pretty pathetic.

40:55.365 --> 40:58.789
That's about the best description I can

40:59.123 --> 41:09.658
give because they had just, two years before I arrived, they had just lost their accreditation from the American Chemical Society.

41:10.259 --> 41:22.397
American Chemical Society said, you guys are doing such a lousy job, you get no recognition from us as being a qualified Department of Chemistry.

41:23.845 --> 41:41.422
And so Fred Jensen had been hired, when that happened, to try to bring things back to a much better state than it was when they lost their accreditation.

41:41.522 --> 41:45.246
But when I arrived, things were still pretty sad.

41:45.766 --> 41:46.707
We had two people.

41:46.767 --> 41:52.553
We had about a total of 12 people in the department, as I remember.

41:54.220 --> 42:07.217
Two people were doing research and Fred Johnson was doing a little bit of research, but not a very large amount.

42:09.620 --> 42:21.696
Kenny Hancock was one of the two people doing research and I can't remember the physical chemist that we had at that time and he was doing, and he was a fine chemist.

42:22.553 --> 42:28.280
and he went to Oak Ridge two or three years later, and so they lost him.

42:28.320 --> 42:47.522
But the rest of the people had been hired over a period of years, and they had not tried to keep up with modern-day chemistry.

42:50.926 --> 42:52.408
They talked

42:53.418 --> 42:56.782
in the classroom but did no research of any kind.

42:59.164 --> 43:09.094
Some of them were so bad that after a few years they were put on leave.

43:09.475 --> 43:16.242
They received a salary but were told not to come to the chemistry department and teach anymore.

43:17.643 --> 43:19.105
That's how bad things were.

43:19.709 --> 43:27.943
In terms of the laboratory equipment, laboratories and the equipment, were they also behind the times there?

43:28.745 --> 43:30.748
Very badly behind times.

43:30.908 --> 43:39.523
I remember Fred Jensen in maybe this letter where he told me that I had been hired said,

43:39.892 --> 43:42.436
I understand you want to do some research.

43:45.060 --> 43:51.910
Send me a list of things that you probably will need, and I'll see if I can't find some money to get it.

43:55.055 --> 44:03.908
And I didn't know what kind of a list to send him, but the list I sent

44:04.411 --> 44:05.112
They didn't have.

44:05.172 --> 44:13.125
They had lots of glassware for freshman chemistry, sophomore chemistry, junior chemistry courses.

44:17.011 --> 44:31.735
They had no electronic equipment of any kind, but that was before the development of any significant electronic devices for measuring things in chemistry anyway.

44:33.706 --> 44:37.320
But when I arrived,

44:38.380 --> 44:52.676
I had a vacuum pump, which I had asked for, which you can't get along without in an organic chemistry laboratory, and I can't think of what else that I may have had.

44:52.696 --> 45:05.991
I don't know whether you know what a heating mantle is, but they are safer devices than heating with Bunsen burners.

45:06.578 --> 45:13.909
because if you heat a flask of some highly flammable material in the flask breaks, you have a terrible fire.

45:14.450 --> 45:25.347
The heating metal was made mainly of spun glass fiber and with heating elements buried in there,

45:25.327 --> 45:51.009
I built my own heating mantles once I got here by taking a coffee can and making up a plaster of asbestos and I don't remember what the hardening agent was, and I embedded a heating wire down in there, rolls of heating wire, and I used them for a number of years.

45:51.750 --> 45:54.372
Our facilities were atrocious.

45:54.790 --> 46:00.338
nonexistent, as far as I was concerned, for any quality research work.

46:00.638 --> 46:18.182
The Welsh Foundation, though, came aboard about the second year I was here, and once I received a Welsh grant, I had some funds to buy some pretty decent equipment.

46:18.162 --> 46:20.044
Not a lot.

46:20.705 --> 46:29.457
My total grant for, I got one of the first grants given by the Welch Foundation.

46:29.517 --> 46:40.812
The total amount was $18,000 a year for three years, and that in those days was magnificent, at least at Texas A&M.

46:41.315 --> 46:45.120
In that era, the department offered graduate degrees.

46:47.243 --> 46:52.010
Yes, they did, but they sure had no right to.

46:52.070 --> 47:08.233
We had about two or three graduate students there, and we only had one or two faculty members that were really qualified to give these students any kind of really good graduate training.

47:08.213 --> 47:12.748
in the laboratory, and we had no graduate courses to speak of at all.

47:14.133 --> 47:18.848
And so that didn't change for a while.
