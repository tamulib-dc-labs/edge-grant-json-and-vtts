00:02.292 --> 00:08.682
Pretty hard to beat.

00:08.702 --> 00:10.264
But it's meant everything to me.

00:10.304 --> 00:15.532
We worked hard.

00:15.672 --> 00:16.954
Mother and I worked hard.

00:17.335 --> 00:26.629
Let's make believe that somebody walked up to you and gave you a check for a million dollars today, and it had one condition on it.

00:27.335 --> 00:33.965
You had to pass that on to Texas A&M, but you could decide what it would be used for.

00:34.987 --> 00:40.536
If you could give a million dollars to A&M, what would you want it to do?

00:41.958 --> 00:54.658
Well, I want to tell you, as crippled as Mother and I, you know we've given them over $100,000 to the Aggie Club, and that's for

00:56.309 --> 00:59.313
for seats for the rest of our lives.

01:00.455 --> 01:17.738
And anyway, last year when we tried to get up those baseball steps over there, I said if I ever won enough on that one lotto ticket, I was going to get them an escalator.

01:18.779 --> 01:23.245
And that's one of the things that I would do.

01:27.140 --> 01:32.448
What else would you do if you didn't have to worry about the source of the money?

01:32.588 --> 01:35.152
What parts of A&M are dearest to your heart?

01:36.254 --> 01:43.304
I guess the athletic businesses.

01:44.065 --> 01:54.801
Because Bones and I, and Harry Statler and I, and I didn't get

01:55.912 --> 01:58.056
very wonderful that he does.

01:58.737 --> 02:08.434
But Shelby has meant a lot to me, and Archie Sloan has meant a lot to me.

02:08.454 --> 02:18.392
In fact, I don't know of any school that I know

02:21.005 --> 02:29.255
that have done more in the way of building up this program than R.C.

02:31.617 --> 02:32.899
He's done a great job.

02:35.982 --> 02:46.995
Now, I don't know aboutâ€”Shelby did a good job, and I don't know what he's going to do now.

02:48.308 --> 02:50.844
We've been good friends many, many, many years.

02:52.474 --> 02:54.808
Let's quit with that then.
