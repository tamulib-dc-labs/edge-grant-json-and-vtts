WEBVTT

00:01.887 --> 00:13.163
Well, that I wanted to

00:01.887 --> 00:13.163
get where the action was and where I was needed and 
where I was trained to be.

00:18.231 --> 00:28.646
I hadn't trained to be in the State Department down 
in South America where the war going on worldwide

00:18.231 --> 00:28.646
and all my friends

00:18.231 --> 00:28.646
on the way. Did you put in for a transfer? Well, that 
was almost every day, every opportunity I had. I'd

00:37.121 --> 00:39.344
been doing that for a long time. They were, the War 
Department was insistent that I stay where I was.

00:47.575 --> 00:57.247
And the Chief of Staff of the Air Force was asking 
for me every chance he got.

00:57.267 --> 01:00.652
He finally got me, but it took a long time. Once you 
get Air Force officer got detached and with

01:03.059 --> 01:10.911
another department.

01:10.931 --> 01:13.295
That was free to that department, you see. Sure. 
It's hell to get them out.

01:19.665 --> 01:21.568
Real hard to get them out. Were you happy to leave 
Costa Rica and go to Miami Beach in 1942, even

01:21.588 --> 01:29.100
though you were still in the American 
Intelligence Command? Well, actually I had to

01:29.182 --> 01:31.906
leave Panama. You see, when I was relieved in 
Colombia, finally I was assigned to that

01:32.486 --> 01:40.457
intelligence office in Panama, Canal Zone. And I 
got relieved from there and went to Miami Beach.

01:45.003 --> 01:45.985
And yes, I was. Not that I was happy about the 
intelligence command, but I got closer back where

01:46.586 --> 01:56.059
I could start doing something by getting back in 
the airport. That's what I wanted to do. Now what

01:57.228 --> 02:01.674
is, what was your job as Air Officer, American 
Intelligence Command? Well, American

02:01.694 --> 02:14.191
Intelligence Command was a command that was set up 
to provide intelligence of the North and South

02:01.694 --> 02:14.191
American continents. Geographic kind of 
division of responsibility for collection,

02:14.352 --> 02:21.161
evaluation, and what not. And my job there was to 
head the air section of that and collect and

02:24.177 --> 02:42.023
evaluate and report intelligence information 
for the North and South American continent area

02:24.177 --> 02:42.023
into the head G2 office in Pentagon. Why do they 
have a qualified pilot of bombers do a job like

02:42.043 --> 02:51.957
that? Why didn't they have another Air Force 
officer, like a navigator or someone like that?

03:00.172 --> 03:00.873
Why a pilot?

03:06.400 --> 03:08.802
There are ways and ways to look at that, of course. 
And if you have someone who is evaluating air

03:08.983 --> 03:16.932
information,

03:19.409 --> 03:32.384
you will take or assume a qualification of a pilot 
officer before you would of a non-pilot officer.

03:32.404 --> 03:33.044
That's natural. I certainly would. So if you can 
afford the luxury of having a pilot in that job,

03:35.347 --> 03:41.994
you're going to have him in here. If you can't, you 
just settle for what's next best. and they were

03:47.860 --> 03:51.604
able to hold me for it for a while. And did they give 
you a promotion? Yes, I was promoted as long as I was

03:55.488 --> 04:01.695
already way behind at that time. I can't say that 
this command kept me behind. I was just behind

04:06.941 --> 04:13.328
because I wasn't in the Air Force doing things that 
warranted promotion.

04:15.164 --> 04:19.330
But I was promoted, I believe, to major within that 
command. I'm sure that's right, yeah. And how many

04:21.754 --> 04:23.977
men under your command?

04:29.005 --> 04:39.321
Well, not really a very

04:29.005 --> 04:39.321
good measure of

04:29.005 --> 04:39.321
the job. There were probably...

04:43.345 --> 04:53.619
300 in that order, but there's scattered 
detachments all over the whole western

04:43.345 --> 04:53.619
hemisphere. And most of them were reporting

04:55.902 --> 05:03.493
rather than acting under command. They were

05:07.544 --> 05:12.872
under command insofar as the function of 
reporting information is concerned. But someone

05:13.713 --> 05:25.011
else, their parent command was charged with 
providing the other things that one provides on

05:13.713 --> 05:25.011
command, food and shelter and transportation and 
all these kind of things. So this is much more like a

05:25.031 --> 05:33.063
staff job than it is a command job. And you must have 
worked directly with the Army and the Navy Yes,

05:36.670 --> 05:41.157
they're in the same building for this command. The 
whole thing there was under, well it was under army

05:41.978 --> 05:46.585
officer at that time. And is this sort of a 
predecessor to the DIA? Well, yes, except DIA of

05:53.915 --> 06:00.585
course is worldwide.

06:02.911 --> 06:04.453
No, I wouldn't say that. G-2. Were you in the OSS? I 
mean, was it part of that? No, no. No, it was part of

06:09.819 --> 06:14.024
the Army Air Force intelligence.

06:17.988 --> 06:21.532
DIA developed later out of other considerations. 
This

06:21.913 --> 06:32.665
was just an administrative way of handling 
information at that time by G-2. of the Army.

06:37.384 --> 06:41.088
I don't think it had any real long-range 
significance at all. It was just a way of getting it

06:41.168 --> 06:44.152
done at that time. Were there major problems that 
you had? Were there certain things that you were

06:47.456 --> 06:49.358
looking for? Well, every day of course there are 
those things, and they change almost every day.

06:55.825 --> 06:57.167
Not quite,

07:05.180 --> 07:14.254
Subversion of local governments was one of the big 
problems.

07:14.314 --> 07:19.702
German-Italian influence of various activities 
that went on in the Western Hemisphere. And of

07:21.004 --> 07:28.555
course information on German submarines was just 
every minute of every day and night.

07:32.281 --> 07:36.186
There were many things they were looking for, yes. 
Did you spot German submarines? Oh yes, many of

07:38.809 --> 07:40.611
them. Oh yes, we did. We were instrumental in 
getting a lot of them sunk.

07:51.264 --> 08:01.917
Now were there certain governments in South and 
Central America or in the Caribbean that you were

07:51.264 --> 08:01.917
more concerned about coming under German or 
Italian influence than others? Oh, yeah. What

08:03.334 --> 08:03.895
were those?

08:08.660 --> 08:16.028
Well, even at this late date, I think it's probably 
not good to discuss that very much.

08:19.693 --> 08:22.536
Some are well known, but some aren't.

08:27.441 --> 08:30.064
Columbia

08:32.575 --> 08:44.952
had some wonderful people in its government, but 
there were lots of people

08:32.575 --> 08:44.952
who weakened what that government could do, how 
effective it was. It was strongly

08:44.973 --> 08:50.681
pro-Axis.

08:55.708 --> 09:00.895
To a greater or lesser degree, there were others.

09:06.308 --> 09:13.819
It's probably not too good to talk about that one 
very much, even now.

09:13.959 --> 09:14.159
Okay. In 1943, July of 43, you left. You were eager 
to leave, I bet. Yes. In May of 43, I got my orders to

09:21.409 --> 09:25.435
the Second Air Force. That was headquarters in 
Spokane, Washington.

09:33.680 --> 09:43.073
commanded by a man named Johnson, for whom I had 
worked at Hamilton Field, and he knew me.

09:46.677 --> 09:56.751
So, when he heard I was coming back, he assigned me 
to command a group of B-24s to go to North Africa as

09:46.677 --> 09:56.751
fast as I could train them and get them out of there.

10:02.114 --> 10:08.300
he had a chief of staff

10:02.114 --> 10:08.300
named Nathan Bedford Forrest.

10:13.025 --> 10:28.881
And when he saw that I had been out of the States for 
about seven years,

10:13.025 --> 10:28.881
and hadn't done my tour of duty as training in the 
United States, training others, He couldn't

10:30.532 --> 10:36.060
stand to see me pick up a group and go to North 
Africa. He thought I ought to do my stint here

10:36.080 --> 10:39.185
first. So while I was en route from Spokane to 
Tucson, where the group was to be, he changed my

10:41.228 --> 10:49.460
order. Ordered me to take over the training group, 
and the guy who had the training group to take my

10:50.843 --> 10:55.189
group. and put it together and go to North Africa, 
which we did.

11:05.519 --> 11:17.734
Meantime,

11:05.519 --> 11:17.734
when I got the training group started, the wing of 
which we were a part, I think had seventeen groups

11:05.519 --> 11:17.734
in it. were in bad need of an operations officer. 
And the man who was commanding it knew me and knew my

11:24.033 --> 11:28.160
experience. And so he relieved me of the training 
group and made me the wing operations officer.

11:36.512 --> 11:49.932
I was the wing operations officer about three 
weeks when I got a wire from the chief of staff's

11:36.512 --> 11:49.932
office in Washington

11:36.512 --> 11:49.932
ordering me to India.

11:53.422 --> 12:14.499
So

11:53.422 --> 12:14.499
my wife and family had just joined me there, and

11:53.422 --> 12:14.499
we moved into a house in Tucson because there were 
no quarters available.

12:14.519 --> 12:16.543
So I went home

12:18.751 --> 12:22.815
told my wife what to do about getting my bag 
together in the afternoon. I worked that night and

12:22.876 --> 12:26.640
got home early the next morning. I got on the 
airplane for India that afternoon about one

12:26.660 --> 12:37.171
o'clock and didn't get back for about thirty 
months. What were your thoughts on going to India?

12:42.898 --> 12:44.019
It was going to war. I was just as happy Was it India 
or anyplace else? That doesn't bother me. I'll

12:50.255 --> 12:53.162
find out what there was in India. General 
Stratmire had asked for me. That's all I wanted to

12:54.766 --> 12:56.971
know.

12:58.675 --> 13:04.148
General Strat was a group commander of the 7th Bomb 
Group back at Hamilton Field and I was his pilot and

13:05.731 --> 13:10.197
his operations officer there as a second 
lieutenant. He hadn't seen me since that time, but

13:10.257 --> 13:15.044
he knew what I could do. So he wanted me in India. So 
he promoted me to colonel and put me on the airplane

13:18.548 --> 13:27.160
and we went to New Delhi, the next stop.

13:27.180 --> 13:28.802
And when did you arrive in New Delhi?

13:33.068 --> 13:38.880
Late July, July 25th as I remember, late July of 43. 
He

13:38.960 --> 13:54.992
assigned me there as assistant to the Deputy Chief 
of Staff Operations for Air Force's CBI, China

13:38.960 --> 13:54.992
India Burma Theater.

13:58.617 --> 14:16.436
And I worked at that job until I got to know India and 
know what was there and

13:58.617 --> 14:16.436
what the British capability was and what we could 
do, learn my way around. What was the British

14:17.117 --> 14:18.638
capability? Well, the British had some air forces 
there, mainly Indian air units that were manned by

14:20.020 --> 14:27.628
Indians. And

14:28.570 --> 14:36.341
it was practically negligible, not very much. And 
we didn't have very much either. We had the 10th Air

14:38.243 --> 14:52.043
Force there, which had the 7th Bomb Group, the same 
group I had back in Hamilton Field, the same group I

14:38.243 --> 14:52.043
was

14:38.243 --> 14:52.043
in. And a couple of fighter units. That's all they 
had. The 14th Air Force, of course, in China with

14:58.187 --> 15:04.515
Chennault, which wasn't under that headquarters 
yet at that time.

15:09.601 --> 15:22.017
I went on and worked in that job, and we got orders 
from Washington to work out a plan for bringing to

15:09.601 --> 15:22.017
bear the B-29s on Japan.

15:26.131 --> 15:47.869
And

15:26.131 --> 15:47.869
so for the next almost a month,

15:26.131 --> 15:47.869
my assistant and I, a man named Mean, generated the 
plan to base the B-29s in India through Chengdu and

15:48.237 --> 16:00.588
China and hit Japan and staged back through 
Chengdu to India for Beijing.

16:00.608 --> 16:09.636
And that was day and night around the clock in the 
war room until we got it finished and handed it to

16:00.608 --> 16:09.636
the guy to take to Washington. Well, they approved 
it later and then we had to implement it, so we got

16:09.656 --> 16:16.962
busy about that.

16:20.215 --> 16:23.981
And how many bomb runs did we have using that run? 
Oh, quite a lot.

16:29.328 --> 16:31.271
Yeah, I don't remember now.

16:37.701 --> 16:43.689
They probably went on around 20 missions, and 
there were three squadrons of B-29s.

16:47.735 --> 16:49.598
There'd be like 50 at a mission. So there was some 
very substantial effort before we got through it.

16:56.718 --> 17:00.123
And is it from this area that we did a lot of the 
firebombs? Yes, they did a great deal of it, a very

17:01.625 --> 17:06.211
great deal of it.

17:10.817 --> 17:18.808
Much of that though came from Saipan, came from the 
other way after they captured Saipan. Amen. We

17:20.146 --> 17:28.216
considered the firebombs not an adequate 
payload. The things that we needed, thought

17:28.236 --> 17:35.525
needed damaging, we couldn't do it with 
firebombs. Heavy submarine installations and

17:36.627 --> 17:45.538
heavy

17:36.627 --> 17:45.538
revetments and stuff, we were after.

17:49.889 --> 17:57.200
And did you do any of the bombing in China itself 
against Japanese forces in the Manchuria area or

17:49.889 --> 17:57.200
in North China? Not with the B-29. We operated 
against them all the time with the B-24, B-25, all

17:58.963 --> 18:10.160
of the fighter

17:58.963 --> 18:10.160
and fighter bomber airplanes. We operated all the 
time against them there. Now did you yourself get

18:13.846 --> 18:17.972
out of headquarters and get to do some flying? 
Some. I got to do some flying, but very little

18:20.218 --> 18:26.006
combat flying. As a matter of fact, the old man 
prohibited me from doing any of it.

18:37.502 --> 18:40.406
I did get on one good long mission, but that was all. 
And where was that to? out of eastern India across

18:44.817 --> 18:51.705
Burma into Thailand.

18:55.550 --> 19:01.697
Attacked against Japanese aircraft at what is now 
Bangkok, outside of Bangkok. And you were

19:01.717 --> 19:03.580
attacking the base? Yeah. Was it a fighter or 
bomber base? Aircraft on the base. There were a few

19:08.946 --> 19:13.812
Bettys, but they were mostly zero, mostly 
fighter.

19:16.458 --> 19:17.860
Or was it a low level of time? Yeah, right in the 
deck. In the middle of the day? Right on the deck.

19:23.188 --> 19:24.490
Oh, right on the deck. But was it at dawn? No, it was 
about the middle of the day, as a matter of fact.

19:29.577 --> 19:31.960
Just about the middle of the day, 11 o'clock, I 
guess. How successful was it? Very. We got what we

19:36.026 --> 19:37.268
went for. I don't remember the statistics on it, 
but we wiped out the airplanes that were on the

19:39.931 --> 19:44.898
field.

19:49.264 --> 19:53.690
They were so complacent, the Japanese, because 
they didn't think we could reach them. And if we

19:54.992 --> 20:02.102
hadn't have gotten the new P-51s, well we couldn't 
have, but they didn't know we got them. So we

20:02.122 --> 20:04.625
reached them. Got it. And what were you flying? 
P-51. That's all they wanted.

20:11.774 --> 20:15.345
on that mission. Why did the commander let you go on 
that mission? Well, he didn't have much choice. I

20:22.026 --> 20:23.691
told him to.

20:33.678 --> 20:39.385
That was pretty much the only combat mission that 
he let you go? Yeah, that's right. I was along on a

20:40.947 --> 20:46.535
lot of others, but I wasn't doing the job. Okay, so 
you were observing on the others? Well, yes and no.

20:56.105 --> 21:12.620
When Mountbatten came over to assume command, one 
of the things that he had to do to get his house in

20:56.105 --> 21:12.620
order was to go over to China and call on Chiang 
Kai-shek,

20:56.105 --> 21:12.620
which is a job I think he didn't relish too much.

21:15.683 --> 21:24.171
But he asked Donald Stratt

21:15.683 --> 21:24.171
and some others to go on the trip. I was one of them. 
We went out of New Delhi and went into Assam, which

21:29.688 --> 21:39.982
is on the India side of the hump.

21:40.022 --> 21:52.960
What I wanted to do was to fly over the hump into 
Kunming and then change airplanes and go to

21:40.022 --> 21:52.960
Chongqing, because the only thing that could land 
at Chongqing was a DC-3. bomber or anything like

21:53.665 --> 22:02.016
that up here in the mountains.

22:02.036 --> 22:19.099
So we went over the hump and went into Kunming and 
changed to DC-3 and went on up to Chongqing and had

22:02.036 --> 22:19.099
our two days of conversations with Chiang and his 
people and headed back. but took off out of Kunming

22:21.492 --> 22:29.461
one morning about a little bit before sunup, just a 
little bit before. General Stratt was in the

22:32.144 --> 22:35.608
airplane and I was flying it. I had a copilot and the 
surgeon was in there and the rest were crew, tail

22:35.628 --> 22:46.420
gunner and turret gunner and ball gunner and nose 
gunner.

22:49.319 --> 22:52.262
It was a beautiful morning over the hump. It was 
just one little thin layer of clouds, about 18,000

22:52.282 --> 22:57.347
feet.

23:00.330 --> 23:05.575
Nice Sunday morning, everybody quiet.

23:05.595 --> 23:18.128
They were cruising along just above this layer of 
clouds, and

23:05.595 --> 23:18.128
this top turret gunner reported a zero at 9 
o'clock, and I looked. Just in time to see him duck

23:25.513 --> 23:28.998
back into this little thin layer of clouds. He just 
popped up like that and ducked back right off the

23:29.038 --> 23:37.410
wing tail, but quite a ways off.

23:37.430 --> 23:40.934
So I opened the throttles a little bit to get a 
little more speed. Told General Stratton what was

23:42.777 --> 23:45.060
happening.

23:49.360 --> 24:01.916
The aircraft had been modified so that people 
could sit in it in the area where it would normally

23:49.360 --> 24:01.916
be occupied by the bomb bay or by part of the bomb 
bay. I placed the top turret up here with the bottom

24:02.697 --> 24:12.229
under it open and that's where the seats would be.

24:14.065 --> 24:20.394
when General Stratton stood up, he stood on the 
edge and looked through the door over my shoulder

24:14.065 --> 24:20.394
into the cockpit.

24:24.460 --> 24:31.750
The surgeon who was sitting by him, alongside of 
him, didn't move, he just stayed there. He didn't

24:31.770 --> 24:39.541
know, he wasn't plugged in so he didn't know what 
was happening.

24:39.561 --> 24:42.165
And the doctor had gone to report him again and only 
about half as far out.

24:48.093 --> 24:59.911
And so I bent the straddles a little bit more to get a 
little more speed, and just the less time it takes

24:48.093 --> 24:59.911
to say that, the top turret gun started going off. 
He started shooting at them. Yeah, because he had

25:01.473 --> 25:08.203
popped over and came up right on the tail.

25:08.639 --> 25:14.228
he was firing at us, although none of them on that 
blast hit us. But they, well these two twin 50s went

25:14.248 --> 25:18.555
off in this turret up here. The red-hot 50 caliber 
shells started falling out of that thing like this

25:18.615 --> 25:28.791
right down everybody's lap down in the path here. 
and we were on oxygen. So, this surgeon reached

25:31.604 --> 25:39.492
over first thing, picked one of these up, of 
course, and put it down there in a white heat. I

25:39.872 --> 25:41.234
don't know why he did it. And then he recognized 
what was going on. By that time, the zero had popped

25:47.600 --> 25:56.449
up again, and he put a string of bullet holes right 
through the wing section of that airplane at that

25:47.600 --> 25:56.449
time. And the tail gunner started hollering, I got 
him, I got him. And he did. He shot him down on that

26:02.287 --> 26:03.989
path. I

26:04.189 --> 26:12.377
looked back there, and the surgeon was just as 
white as a goddamn sheet. And he was still rubbing

26:12.998 --> 26:18.823
his throat and didn't have his oxygen mask

26:12.998 --> 26:18.823
on. I asked him a few minutes, what the hell 
happened? What's the matter with you? And he said,

26:21.946 --> 26:24.929
hell, I swallowed my oxygen mask. I had to pull it 
back up.

26:29.302 --> 26:35.270
Oh boy, he was really a scared man when he found out 
what was happening there.

26:38.274 --> 26:44.702
But they got the airplane, we flew on across the 
hump, nothing further in the way and went on home.

26:47.046 --> 26:48.628
You must have been fairly heavily armed then. What 
did you have, three .50 caliber mounts on that?

26:52.333 --> 26:52.693
Four. I had the top gun, the one I was talking about 
there, then you had the tail gun all the way back in

26:52.960 --> 27:12.181
the back, and then the ball turret, which is in the 
bottom, and then the nose turret, all with twin

26:52.960 --> 27:12.181
50s, you see. So you had a heck of a lot more on them 
than that Jebs? Yeah, he's crazy.

27:19.201 --> 27:20.222
Well, I won't say that. He didn't use very good 
judgment on it, at least. Because he was bound to

27:24.887 --> 27:26.388
get it.

27:31.994 --> 27:37.379
But I didn't have very many experiences to write 
about during the war, combat experiences during

27:31.994 --> 27:37.379
the war. That was a different kind of experience to 
me. Now, let's talk about how you got along with the

27:43.585 --> 27:47.689
Indians. people, and what was it like living 
there?

27:53.334 --> 28:03.448
Well, perhaps I can do better by talking about what 
I did there, because you didn't have very much

27:53.334 --> 28:03.448
contact with the Indians, to be true. When we 
finished this plan for the basing of the B-29s, and

28:05.532 --> 28:18.030
that was almost in isolation, you see, we were just 
locked up all the time while we were doing that, and

28:05.532 --> 28:18.030
going every hour of 24 hours that you could stand on 
your feet. We got that finished, and that was the

28:23.235 --> 28:32.149
time that the Sexton Conference was coming up, the 
conference in Cairo.

28:34.813 --> 28:44.828
And, you

28:34.813 --> 28:44.828
know, Stratton wanted me to go to that conference 
as the air planner for him.

28:47.778 --> 28:53.588
as well as to work with Chenault and Mountbatten.

28:57.815 --> 28:59.597
And Shanks, that's a new Shanks. So I went with 
them. So you went to the Cairo conference?

29:09.534 --> 29:09.634
Yeah. I've forgotten how long I was there, but it 
was about ten days, and a few more days, ten I guess.

29:22.179 --> 29:36.213
And I worked with all those people while I was 
there, as well as our own people from Washington,

29:22.179 --> 29:36.213
General Marshall, General Arnold, General 
Handy, General Kuehler, and all the others that

29:22.179 --> 29:36.213
were there. So it was a most interesting

29:44.225 --> 29:45.627
most interesting time. And that, as you know, was 
the time when the final decisions really were made

29:45.667 --> 29:52.695
as to how this war was going to be won. And they went 
out from there and did it that way. I mean there were

29:57.941 --> 30:01.805
minor changes, but not really significant 
changes. So it was the starting point of really the

30:02.006 --> 30:07.532
strategy that ended the war. It was a very 
important conference. I did not go up to Tehran

30:10.487 --> 30:13.977
with him to see Joe Stalin. I wished I could have, 
but I wasn't that high up. And now as the air

30:21.569 --> 30:25.114
planner, what was your function there? To talk 
with Hap Arnold and to discuss the problems or

30:25.154 --> 30:30.021
what? Well, every plan that anybody presents, and 
see this was a combined chiefs of staff. Yeah,

30:37.371 --> 30:37.731
right. They have an immediate. You have to have an 
air plan along with it, whatever it happens to be.

30:44.961 --> 30:47.745
And Mountbatten was full of plans.

30:50.442 --> 31:02.475
And so I had to put the air section of his plans 
together, as he presented, and then answer

30:50.442 --> 31:02.475
questions that were raised

30:50.442 --> 31:02.475
about the facts of the matter. How many airplanes 
has he got? What can they do? This kind of question.

31:08.061 --> 31:18.913
And so I did that for Mountbatten, Chennault,

31:08.061 --> 31:18.913
and General Stratton.

31:22.808 --> 31:32.842
and worked with the other planners from all of 
those commands in helping getting their

31:22.808 --> 31:32.842
presentations ready.

31:38.570 --> 31:41.475
It was a very interesting time in another respect. 
I spent, I lived with General Chennault in

31:41.575 --> 31:45.580
downtown Cairo. The British had taken over the 
houses and assigned people to them and they

31:49.201 --> 32:13.065
assigned people to the houses to do the cooking and 
taking care of things which you have to do in a

31:49.201 --> 32:13.065
situation like that for security reasons as well 
as logistic reasons

31:49.201 --> 32:13.065
but sometimes we could be through with our work out 
at the main house so And the combined chief's going

32:14.311 --> 32:18.656
to be considered another problem that didn't 
leave us around there. We'd get the hell out of

32:18.676 --> 32:24.703
there and go home.

32:24.723 --> 32:40.302
I listened to Johnson off for two days

32:24.723 --> 32:40.302
from like 3 o'clock in the afternoon until too 
tired to stay up any longer at night, telling me the

32:24.723 --> 32:40.302
story of the wandering Jew. And I don't think he 
repeated an incident or a lie. It took him that

32:47.588 --> 32:48.629
long. That man's knowledge of history was 
something that I'll marvel at as long as I live.

32:56.539 --> 32:57.440
Then he was good.

33:04.049 --> 33:05.530
Can you describe Chenault for me? He was a

33:14.082 --> 33:17.687
had been described as a wild man of all kinds of 
things. He was actually a very careful,

33:17.727 --> 33:37.913
thoughtful man who felt that with proper training 
and equipment that Americans could exceed in any

33:17.727 --> 33:37.913
kind of air fighting.

33:41.378 --> 33:43.060
Could excel on that rather than And

33:43.833 --> 33:58.369
he was a tactician in terms of developing tactics 
for a particular attack, making that separate

33:43.833 --> 33:58.369
from strategy.

34:04.075 --> 34:07.659
And he was a very good, very accomplished fighter 
pilot. I mean, a fighter jockey, if you want to call

34:07.679 --> 34:11.663
him that. he could make his airplane do what he 
wanted it to do, and when he wanted it to do it.

34:18.112 --> 34:21.295
Therefore, not many people whipped him in the air. 
And he taught his people in such a way that this held

34:21.576 --> 34:25.860
for them. And with the AVGs, why, he proved it to the 
world. Because the P-40 was certainly no match for

34:34.290 --> 34:39.115
the Zero. But it shot down a lot of Zeros just the 
same.

34:48.768 --> 35:16.429
he had the confidence of a lot of people, including 
Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang,

34:48.768 --> 35:16.429
and the support of a lot of Chinese

34:48.768 --> 35:16.429
officers,

34:48.768 --> 35:16.429
and therefore a very great deal of influence on 
whatever military operations would take place in

34:48.768 --> 35:16.429
China. Generally this was good. I don't mean it as 
something bad,

35:22.910 --> 35:33.668
but I think of him as a very wise, kind, 
compassionate man.

35:37.935 --> 35:40.299
A real fine American. You were a colonel at the 
time. How did the general get along with his

35:41.622 --> 35:44.847
subordinates? John Chenault? Wonderful. 
Wonderful. Every one of them respected him very

35:49.312 --> 35:51.297
much. Many of them idolized him.

35:58.014 --> 36:02.565
By the time I'm talking about, they'd all been 
decommissioned and they were civilians, you see.

36:04.975 --> 36:15.606
while we were there that we got them reinstated 
later on so that they became officers again in the

36:04.975 --> 36:15.606
Air Force. But he had the full support of his 
subordinates and always has any job he's ever had.

36:23.954 --> 36:29.599
It's his superiors that he hasn't gotten along 
with so well.

36:29.640 --> 36:33.143
He's a little bit impatient with them and he had 
some some peers that are pretty damn hard to get

36:33.376 --> 36:37.900
along with themselves. Example, Stilwell.

36:41.684 --> 36:43.486
Did you get to know General Stilwell? Oh, yeah. I 
got to know him well enough. Could you describe

36:46.048 --> 36:47.009
him? Well, I'd be a little bit biased, because when 
he found out I had been recommended for promotion

36:49.111 --> 36:59.801
to Breeder General, he wired John Marshall not to 
do it. No kidding. Why was that?

37:04.780 --> 37:06.662
it came out to be something silly. I had written a 
plan in my planning headquarters there in New

37:06.682 --> 37:18.015
Delhi

37:06.682 --> 37:18.015
to win the war in CBR. Nothing strange about that. 
One of my responsibilities was planning, so we did

37:19.277 --> 37:24.943
it. And for the purposes of this plan, we made an air 
theater out of the theater and won the war in the air

37:31.865 --> 37:41.820
by air power. And in doing that we had an air officer 
as theater commander which seemed perfectly

37:42.121 --> 37:51.595
natural to me.

37:54.983 --> 38:04.798
when the air planner, General Keeler, who was A-5 
of the air staff back here in Washington, came

37:54.983 --> 38:04.798
through China, or through India, I told him about 
that. And he said, let me have a copy of it. Well, I

38:10.566 --> 38:12.369
didn't think a damn thing about it. I gave him a copy 
of it. He was the head planner for the Air Force,

38:21.275 --> 38:23.357
And he read it on the way home from CBI. And when he 
got back there, he liked it. And he gave it to

38:26.480 --> 38:28.842
General Handy. And General Handy was the G3 of the 
Army. In other words, General Marshall, the

38:35.529 --> 38:37.211
planner. And General Handy read the plan, which 
flattered me very much that he'd even read it. But

38:43.216 --> 38:43.837
he liked it. And so he started talking to General 
Marshall about it. Well, when Stilwell found out

38:50.215 --> 39:06.270
that I had released the plan, which was just a draft 
in my office, without clearing it through him, and

38:50.215 --> 39:06.270
he didn't know a damn thing about it, he hit the 
ceiling. And that's when he sent to work.

39:14.018 --> 39:18.602
He called my boss, John Stratt, out of bed at 3 
o'clock in the morning. I called him all the way

39:19.190 --> 39:28.863
down into the middle of Calcutta to chew him out 
about letting me send this thing in, letting me

39:19.190 --> 39:28.863
release that plant. He caught it on a strap flat 
footed because he didn't know anything about it

39:29.444 --> 39:32.368
either. I hadn't shown it to him or anybody else. 
And it wasn't an attempt to get by with the thing.

39:39.938 --> 39:44.404
It's just that I had finished it and I was telling 
him about it. matter of fact and started off I was

39:46.544 --> 40:04.514
telling Kuehler about what the problem was and 
said it could be solved by this method and he said

39:46.544 --> 40:04.514
why don't you write such a plan and I said well I have 
and that's when he said well let me have

39:46.544 --> 40:04.514
it. So it was much ado about nothing but it damn near 
cost me my promotion just to say. Well, without

40:13.713 --> 40:21.484
being intent to be disrespectful, I think he was a 
good battalion commander.

40:26.091 --> 40:36.386
However, I think he was a real fighting soldier and 
all that, but he didn't have any business with a

40:26.091 --> 40:36.386
command as big as a theater, because he didn't know 
how to handle people and he didn't know what, he

40:26.091 --> 40:36.386
just knew how to hate the British. That's about the 
biggest thing.

40:43.396 --> 40:44.858
You thought the job was over his head?

40:52.209 --> 40:52.630
Sure did. You had an opportunity to meet Shankai 
Shah. And what did you think of that, ma'am? Well,

41:02.024 --> 41:04.948
that's a real hard one. I love the Gothic. In what 
way? And

41:13.012 --> 41:27.010
his sincerity and

41:13.012 --> 41:27.010
his helplessness in a way. He wanted to do the right 
thing. He

41:30.294 --> 41:41.027
never could get enough people to go with him at the 
same time to quite swing it.

41:44.399 --> 41:47.464
and yet that makes him sound like an angel of some 
kind. I don't mean that at all.

41:56.257 --> 41:58.520
I thought he was a great guy. He just had a bear by the 
tail that I don't know whether anybody could have

41:58.600 --> 42:03.428
handled or not. He certainly had the strength of 
his convictions, or he wouldn't have done all the

42:06.072 --> 42:13.022
things he did, including go to Taiwan. But

42:14.639 --> 42:22.130
the U.S. let him down very much. And you can find, of 
course, a lot of people tell you lots of stories

42:23.673 --> 42:30.503
about why that was good and why it was warranted and 
all that. I still think it's a bunch of baloney.

42:40.458 --> 42:50.466
We moved the armies of Chiang into North China to 
take over from the communists and did.

42:50.486 --> 42:52.668
And it was a real operation. We moved nearly 
200,000 troops by air, an average of over 1,000

42:54.510 --> 43:10.363
miles in order to do that on the tail end of a 
pipeline for gasoline. And then the United States

43:12.503 --> 43:30.066
let the troops sit there and starve to death, while 
the Communists took them over.

43:30.266 --> 43:39.118
I

43:30.266 --> 43:39.118
shouldn't say it quite that way.

43:41.140 --> 43:50.801
I think we had the capacity to

43:41.140 --> 43:50.801
have kept him in the driver's seat if we wanted to, 
and we didn't. Did you ever have any conversations

43:52.545 --> 43:55.150
with him? Oh yeah, yes. About what types of topics? 
Several things, everything, every kind of

43:57.936 --> 44:01.444
problem. I had conversations with him about 
military problems, specific things that we dealt

44:02.825 --> 44:16.502
on not a day-to-day basis but a week-to-week basis 
with him. But conversations about lots of other

44:19.025 --> 44:24.192
things too outside the military.

44:30.618 --> 44:33.061
Do you remember any of those conversations? 
Pardon? Do you remember some of those

44:33.241 --> 44:35.304
conversations? And his attitudes? Yes, his 
attitude was one of fun and wholesomeness in the

44:38.948 --> 44:49.982
things that I talked with him about. After Pekin 
fell, a group of us, including General Strath and

44:52.325 --> 45:00.355
myself, went to Peking and had lunch with Chang and 
Madame Chang in the Summer Palace in Peking, and I

45:01.280 --> 45:17.246
was seated next to him for lunch.

45:20.111 --> 45:27.523
Lunch of that kind lasts about three hours, and if 
you don't have some lady standing behind you to

45:29.478 --> 45:36.291
drink your hot rice wine, you won't know the end of 
the three hours comes anyway.

45:40.999 --> 45:47.772
So we talked about everything under the sun, I know 
more.

45:50.116 --> 45:51.739
I enjoyed talking to him very much.

45:58.081 --> 46:06.452
I don't remember specifically

45:58.081 --> 46:06.452
the subjects we talked about. What about the 
charges that he was corrupt?

46:13.161 --> 46:19.870
Well, I think anybody who survives in China at that 
time, probably not true for them, had to do some

46:22.060 --> 46:27.989
things that our people would call corrupt.

46:31.414 --> 46:34.319
And maybe some of them were, I don't know. His aim 
was not corruption. His aim was to

46:37.303 --> 46:43.453
get away from that. To be able to have a government 
and run a government without corruption. But you

46:51.018 --> 46:55.923
can't go from a situation by a wish to a fact. And of 
course there was corruption in the government,

46:57.885 --> 47:06.555
some of which I'm sure he must have had some 
knowledge of. But I don't think he was a party to,

47:09.177 --> 47:17.346
a direct party to.
