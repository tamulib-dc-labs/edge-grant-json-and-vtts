WEBVTT

00:03.727 --> 00:24.618
I don't know, sophomore year, I guess things began to, in hindsight, began to blend together because the sophomore, junior, senior year seemed like a kind of a continuum of experience where the freshman year was unique and that you were proving yourself and you were being tested and evaluated.

00:25.560 --> 00:28.384
Sophomore, junior, senior year, I felt like

00:29.832 --> 00:41.792
more in control, more confident, and more of just an active participant in all that was going on.

00:43.635 --> 00:47.422
Various things, if I see a picture or something will stand out.

00:47.942 --> 00:55.435
One of my friends wrote me a couple of months ago, he remembers going over and winning the drill competition.

00:56.782 --> 00:59.646
on Simpson Field.

01:01.288 --> 01:08.357
And I have just the briefest recollection, but he remembers it like that's one of the big events of his time at A&M.

01:10.219 --> 01:16.868
And I presume that academically your outfit had a wide variety of majors.

01:16.888 --> 01:17.889
Yeah, we did.

01:18.970 --> 01:24.257
And the Commandant of the Corps at that time was whom?

01:28.085 --> 01:39.946
Well I know, I think when we started Joe Davis, Colonel Joe Davis was, and then either my junior year or senior year it became Colonel Denzel L. Baker.

01:41.469 --> 01:44.895
And I don't remember exactly which year it changed over.

01:45.500 --> 02:03.439
The only time that I was ever in the Commandant's Office was in my junior year after the incident over there when I went from Cadet First Sergeant to Cadet Private, and that was the only time I was ever in the Commandant's Office until I came back to be Commandant, and I don't remember who it was that demoted me.

02:05.401 --> 02:13.549
I don't remember my feelings other than the time that I was fortunate to be in the Corps

02:14.795 --> 02:31.579
and that I had allowed something that was potentially disastrous to go on and really, I hope I'm not overdrawn it, but I do recall thinking, learning the lesson about responsibility when you're in charge of people.

02:33.722 --> 02:35.464
Jim Hannigan was the dean of students.

02:35.664 --> 02:38.148
Did you all see much of him?

02:39.710 --> 02:44.076
Only from a distance.

02:45.271 --> 02:51.160
He was the one that signed off on your disciplinary action.

02:51.280 --> 03:13.455
I remember him as always having a pleasant, if not smiling, happy manner about him, but only frequently at a large social activity would I see him.

03:13.925 --> 03:17.469
And this man, Earl Rutter, did you all see much of him?

03:17.829 --> 03:18.951
What was your impression of him?

03:19.291 --> 03:23.836
Well, tremendous amount of respect for President Rutter.

03:23.856 --> 03:38.192
I remember at some point early in my freshman year of him talking to a group of us at the YMCA about the importance of doing well as students and being good Aggies.

03:39.754 --> 03:43.678
And I do remember periodic times in Guyon Hall,

03:45.262 --> 04:04.941
perhaps other places where he would address the Corps, and he was always very much to the point, very direct, very, very confident person.

04:04.961 --> 04:05.903
It was like

04:07.857 --> 04:20.054
this is what you will do, this is what you will be, and there was no even hint or question that that was going to be any different than what he said.

04:25.021 --> 04:32.852
Yell practices, football games, whenever he was on

04:32.832 --> 04:36.596
on public display, he was always impressive.

04:38.198 --> 04:47.769
And I remember feeling very good that he was the president of our university, that he was the guy.

04:48.029 --> 04:51.453
Were you all aware of his World War II experiences?

04:51.873 --> 04:59.802
Yes, although the actual

05:01.705 --> 05:17.301
The extent of it became more apparent to me as I went along in my career when I had occasion to study military history and then coming back as a commandant to

05:18.074 --> 05:37.737
get to know Mrs. Rudder on a personal basis, and the movie Private Ryan, which featured the 2nd Ranger Battalion which he commanded stimulated my interest, and then Mrs. Rudder has had a time or two where she's had members of the unit

05:38.375 --> 05:47.344
over to the house for social activities and being able to talk to his radio man when he was going up the cliffs at Pointe du Huc.

05:48.806 --> 05:51.748
Those are first-hand experiences.

05:51.769 --> 05:56.153
I asked the radio operator, what was it like?

05:56.653 --> 06:05.362
Did you go up first or was it Colonel Rudder up this rope first?

06:05.502 --> 06:08.145
He said, well, he always led the way.

06:08.902 --> 06:13.348
And I said, well, were you getting shot at or were you down below?

06:13.428 --> 06:14.870
And he said, you bet we were getting shot at.

06:14.890 --> 06:16.332
I said, well, did you have a pistol out?

06:16.352 --> 06:16.873
He said, no.

06:16.933 --> 06:23.662
He said, I had to use both hands to climb, he said, but Colonel Rudder definitely had his pistol out.

06:25.224 --> 06:32.514
And I said, was he shooting at targets or was it just to have suppressing fire going up?

06:32.534 --> 06:36.179
And he said, well, he said, I think it was suppressing fire.

06:36.199 --> 06:38.402
He said, we had so much adrenaline

06:38.467 --> 06:44.981
He said, read that, that we were so scared that rather than be passive, you wanted to be active.

06:45.081 --> 06:50.873
I could identify with that because one of the things I learned in combat is you always want your

06:50.988 --> 06:57.335
When you're under fire you want to be returning fire even if you're not sure, exactly sure where the enemy may be.

06:58.136 --> 07:10.288
Twenty years ago when I was president at UTEP and met Omar Bradley for the first time at a football game, he was in a wheelchair, body fragile but mind very sharp.

07:10.308 --> 07:12.951
He looked up at me and he said, were you at A&M?

07:13.111 --> 07:13.592
Yes, sir.

07:14.193 --> 07:15.094
Did you know Earl Rudder?

07:15.274 --> 07:16.455
Yes, sir.

07:16.537 --> 07:31.762
His voice broke a little as he said this next sentence, in 48 years of command responsibility, I never gave a more awful order to any man than the one I gave to Earl Rudder the night before they went up the cliff.

07:32.523 --> 07:43.641
And I had not seen Point to Hock at that point, and he said, because if they hadn't succeeded, we would have had a massacre on both beaches because of what the artillery could have done.

07:44.701 --> 07:48.445
that point and where the Germans were, I understood what he had to say.

07:49.387 --> 07:55.574
And it caused me to appreciate Mr. Rudder even more.

07:56.315 --> 08:00.800
Now, did you all ever think about trying any pranks on him?

08:00.820 --> 08:02.282
Never.

08:03.403 --> 08:04.164
Never.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.727
He was respected.

08:06.827 --> 08:09.651
That's the impression I had.

08:10.111 --> 08:13.375
You just, there was this

08:15.599 --> 08:39.025
I don't know, sense of Aggies were in the minority, were the underdogs, were good and important, but we have something to prove and you've got to fight for everything you want and you've got to be competitive and the friends you have are your Aggie friends.

08:39.443 --> 08:44.208
Who were some of the other key campus personalities during your student days?

08:44.688 --> 08:48.853
Well, President Rutter, James P. Hannigan.

08:51.095 --> 08:53.978
Of course, Pinky Downs was here, the official greeter.

08:53.998 --> 08:55.079
I remember Pinky Downs.

08:55.560 --> 09:01.126
I remember Mr. Mammaliga over in the Health and P.E.

09:01.146 --> 09:01.646
Department.

09:02.447 --> 09:04.489
He was a swimming coach and had been

09:05.026 --> 09:11.996
great diver at Ohio State and he was very much into the training of Randy Mattson for Olympic shot put fame.

09:13.077 --> 09:15.861
I remember Mr. Pinberthy over in health and physical education.

09:16.402 --> 09:20.387
I remember Dr. Chuck McCandless who was an outstanding instructor.

09:21.008 --> 09:22.610
What made him outstanding?

09:22.730 --> 09:34.847
Well, he was real and he was very conscientious and he taught in a manner that he was sharing knowledge with

09:35.047 --> 09:38.292
with the students so that they would be better prepared for challenges.

09:39.413 --> 09:45.862
It wasn't like he was just giving you information that you had to regurgitate on a test.

09:45.902 --> 09:59.181
He was giving you information that would be helpful to you as you went through your life and the sharing views that he had found to be true in his life and in his experiences.

10:00.646 --> 10:05.035
helping you to be prepared to do whatever you wanted to do.

10:06.438 --> 10:07.680
Wayne Stark, did you have any?

10:08.141 --> 10:10.385
No, I unfortunately didn't.

10:10.486 --> 10:15.195
I was not into the, my activities were

10:16.458 --> 10:20.624
were core oriented and I was happy where I was.

10:21.165 --> 10:26.593
Describe the student, the A&M student body at A&M in those years, describe it in general.

10:27.133 --> 10:33.683
Their attitudes, their values, where did they come from, their economic level.

10:34.564 --> 10:35.585
What kind of people were here?

10:36.046 --> 10:41.554
Well, today's vernacular would only be as describing as conservative.

10:42.175 --> 10:48.965
I think there was also a very strong influence of small town Texas.

10:49.005 --> 10:52.630
There was also the influence of farm ranch background.

10:53.952 --> 11:06.630
There was a number of students here from the big cities, i.e., Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, but even the people that came from those cities seemed to

11:08.180 --> 11:29.175
take on the flavor, if you will, of conservative, I make it with my hands and my back, I'm strong physically, I'm fit physically, I know how to operate in a man's world, I know how to get along with people.

11:29.155 --> 11:30.958
You know, there's not a whole lot of gray areas.

11:30.998 --> 11:37.330
You're right or you're wrong, and it's left or it's right, it's not in the middle, etc.

11:37.350 --> 11:48.750
A lot of confident people, a lot of maybe somewhat

11:50.435 --> 12:15.818
sheltered in their beliefs, some of the beliefs not necessarily worldly in nature, but steadfastly held and high morals, high ethics, patriotism, feeling of pride in being a Texan.

12:16.523 --> 12:20.987
Was there any difficulty for a young man from North Dakota here?

12:21.007 --> 12:24.931
I really don't remember.

12:24.971 --> 12:40.407
There might have been some, what's the Yankee doing here type of thing, but I, once again, I never felt bullied, threatened, spat upon.

12:40.487 --> 12:43.510
You know, I never felt belittled.

12:44.266 --> 12:47.832
I'm sure there must have been, but I was such a positive experience.

12:48.132 --> 12:55.724
That's one reason I was so happy and eager to come back to A&M when I retired from the Marine Corps.

12:55.985 --> 13:00.332
What about Hispanics, Jews, Catholics?

13:02.155 --> 13:08.164
I just don't remember any ill feeling or ill actions towards anybody.

13:08.865 --> 13:09.987
Why wasn't there?

13:10.777 --> 13:11.378
I don't know.

13:14.242 --> 13:25.977
To me, I always speak for myself, the core experience was that, hey, the only way you really account for something is when you're a member of a team.

13:27.038 --> 13:28.420
I think that's the key.

13:29.101 --> 13:31.444
Individually you're not going to do anything.

13:31.464 --> 13:35.890
If you're going to have any success, whether it's in business or in the military, you're going to have to be

13:35.870 --> 13:39.739
a good teammate, and you look out for your teammates.

13:39.819 --> 13:52.208
I know now much in a different plane that diversity is the strength of a team, not just because you have

13:52.188 --> 14:18.237
certain people that can do certain skills, you gotta have offensive linemen as well as wide receivers, but on any type of team, when you have diverse people, what it teaches you is that you have to appreciate people for their individual strengths and differences, and then the challenge is to get it to all bind together so that you have a purpose to work together.

14:19.098 --> 14:20.980
And that sounds maybe a little bit

14:21.787 --> 14:30.936
theoretical, and I'm not sure I reflected on that when I was learning it when I went through the Corps, but boy, what powerful lessons, lifetime lessons.

14:31.102 --> 14:33.846
Now, I'm assuming there were some Hispanic students that you knew.

14:33.866 --> 14:53.077
Oh, yeah, I, but, you know, I can remember Roberto Esquivel, who was in my, uh, in my outfit as a freshman, but, um, and, uh, of course my, my, uh, my, um, you know, I already mentioned, uh, Joe Rodriguez, who was our athletic.

14:54.639 --> 14:55.080
That's it.

14:55.100 --> 14:57.784
Hector comes two years after you as Corps Commander?

14:57.933 --> 15:00.115
Yeah, I don't remember Hector in the Corps.

15:00.335 --> 15:01.256
Hector Gutierrez?

15:01.336 --> 15:02.317
Yeah, I know he was.

15:04.199 --> 15:05.441
Let's see.

15:05.701 --> 15:11.747
There weren't many international students, though, in that era.

15:12.628 --> 15:17.072
And integration came after you graduated?

15:17.192 --> 15:17.293
Yeah.

15:18.354 --> 15:18.594
Okay.

15:18.614 --> 15:20.215
Mr. Rudder handled that superbly.

15:21.817 --> 15:22.237
Let's see.

15:22.798 --> 15:24.300
Did you ever go to the quack shack?

15:24.320 --> 15:26.742
Did you ever get sick, have to go to the...

15:26.722 --> 15:29.337
No, I never did.

15:29.377 --> 15:31.247
I guess, you know, I'm like so many

15:32.527 --> 15:35.530
I guess fortunate people, I picked out the right parents.

15:37.052 --> 15:43.820
And I've been really healthy.

15:43.840 --> 15:49.186
I do remember somebody in an outfit got sick, and I remember going to visit them in the hospital.

15:50.488 --> 15:55.573
The reason I went over there is because the upperclassman said, you know, you freshmen go by and see your fish buddy.

15:56.895 --> 16:01.420
And when you get over there, you see what a world of good it means to the individual.

16:01.400 --> 16:10.754
And you carry that modus operandi with you the rest of the time I was on active duty when one of your, in my case, one of my Marines was down.

16:12.316 --> 16:20.789
To go see them and attempt to be uplifting as you can, that's what good leaders do.

16:21.650 --> 16:26.918
Do you remember any campus or neighborhood of the campus religious events?

16:27.353 --> 16:29.016
Did you participate in any?

16:29.156 --> 16:29.737
Well, I did.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.019
I belonged to St.

16:31.359 --> 16:35.846
Thomas Episcopal Church, which is right on the other side of Duncan Field, and that's the church I belong to now.

16:36.387 --> 16:38.430
Did you attend when you were?

16:38.450 --> 16:38.931
Yeah, I sure did.

16:39.111 --> 16:39.892
I was pretty regular.

16:40.874 --> 16:43.317
Describe that, please, because those are hard for me to locate.

16:43.558 --> 16:55.015
Well, I remember during freshman orientation that there was a time when you

16:55.602 --> 17:05.458
put your hand in the air, you signed up for whatever religion you were, and then you were grouped or you met with and they took you to the church.

17:07.141 --> 17:13.411
I remember it was the evening time and they said, you know, this is, I'm sure they said, I don't remember, this is St.

17:13.431 --> 17:16.817
Thomas Episcopal Church, this is where we're located, I want you to come and feel free to come.

17:17.067 --> 17:22.215
And today, it would be very, very, very politically incorrect for A&M to do that.

17:22.295 --> 17:26.662
In the Corps, I require everybody to go to church the first two Sundays they're here.

17:27.544 --> 17:32.872
If they don't go to church, we say, okay, we'll come by, we're going to have character instruction.

17:33.833 --> 17:42.467
However, we recommend you go to church because they know you're coming, and the first two Sundays at Leaf, there'll be lots of food there, and also some of the parishioners have daughters.

17:43.814 --> 17:46.340
So away they go.

17:46.360 --> 17:56.203
And I said it's a way, and we talk all this thing about no man's an island, no person's an island, you've got to get out and meet people, et cetera, and it may be the worst experience you've ever had.

17:56.707 --> 18:01.855
If you try ten experiences, I guarantee you that one or two is going to turn out okay, but if you don't try any, you're not going to get there.

18:02.657 --> 18:04.880
So, duh, you will go, and this is why.

18:05.341 --> 18:07.825
You can see, once in a while you'll see a light go on.

18:07.865 --> 18:13.855
Sometimes you have to force people, but the response has been good.

18:13.835 --> 18:21.367
I didn't have any great revelations or inspirations or whatever.

18:21.888 --> 18:32.185
I've always been a churchgoer and faith has always been a big part of me, but I can't say that I don't remember the names of the minister.

18:32.366 --> 18:33.868
Was there a Sunday night?

18:34.473 --> 18:51.195
No, I remember the thing I used to do, the thing that was 8 o'clock was Holy Communion, and it was 40 minutes, and I could come back and change clothes and go to brunch or breakfast or whatever there was.

18:51.896 --> 18:58.404
What typically did undergraduates do on Sunday nights then?

18:58.424 --> 18:59.586
Well, all I can remember

19:01.186 --> 19:16.159
is that there was a set time you had to be back, usually by 7.30, and there was normally an outfit meeting on Sunday night where the outfit leaders said, this is what's going to happen this week.

19:17.621 --> 19:22.805
Appointed a freshman for all our sins of the previous week, and we said, yes sir, yes sir, don't ever happen again, sir.

19:23.606 --> 19:29.151
All right, now describe a home football Saturday.

19:30.380 --> 19:35.528
How did it begin and what all went on during that day, the home game?

19:36.009 --> 19:38.573
Well, I remember football Friday nights in Duncan.

19:38.694 --> 19:39.034
Oh, yes.

19:39.154 --> 19:39.555
Let's back up.

19:39.595 --> 19:47.528
Football Friday nights because all the girls that would come to Duncan is dates.

19:48.790 --> 20:14.188
And if all the best behavior that we were on and the comments about whose date is particularly nice looking and that type of thing, of course that was all led up to all week by all the, as I mentioned earlier, kind of the gossip at the tables about so-and-so's girls coming down from such and such and so-and-so's girl dumped them and now she's dating somebody in another outfit, et cetera.

20:14.208 --> 20:16.772
So all this kind of social whirl

20:16.752 --> 20:17.573
was going around.

20:17.734 --> 20:23.523
I remember that a lot of the girls would stay at various homes.

20:26.026 --> 20:30.133
Being an out-of-towner, I remember having some blind dates.

20:31.195 --> 20:34.500
Really, I honestly don't remember.

20:34.520 --> 20:40.269
I remember I did have a girl I knew from my high school in North Dakota was going to SMU.

20:40.810 --> 20:42.492
She came down for the SMU game.

20:42.512 --> 20:43.654
I remember that date.

20:43.634 --> 20:53.348
I remember Duncan on Friday night, the girls are here, aren't they attractive?

20:53.368 --> 20:56.733
Boy, this is new and this is neat and we're on our best behavior, etc.

20:57.774 --> 21:08.630
A midnight yell practice of standing out there without a date and having the band march down the quadrangle area and everybody getting in behind the band locking arms as they went by.

21:09.951 --> 21:11.734
Then the band and the yell leaders

21:12.052 --> 21:15.297
leading us around the campus until we came back to Kyle Field.

21:16.539 --> 21:30.039
Going into Kyle Field and being in the North Horseshoe for the Yale practices, no microphones, just the Yale leaders out there.

21:31.742 --> 21:33.064
Been going back that night

21:34.445 --> 21:56.773
getting to bed late, but getting up early the next morning to go to chow, and it seems like, I don't know if we had drilled or not, but things were leading up to the game and then falling out to march over for the game, marching in and knowing that we were being graded, going up in the stands, usually getting outscored.

21:58.627 --> 22:00.389
going down for the yell leaders afterwards.

22:01.651 --> 22:05.276
It was fun to be down on Kyle Field getting the yell leaders and taking them to the fish pond.

22:06.778 --> 22:07.900
That's all kind of blurry.

22:08.240 --> 22:12.647
I don't ever remember specifically tackling a yell leader or specifically carrying a yell leader.

22:13.668 --> 22:17.293
I don't remember yell practice at the fish pond, although I'm sure I was there.

22:17.662 --> 22:26.175
Now, was it, to your outfit's credit, if you and your buddies were one of the ones that tackled a yellow eater and carried him down there?

22:26.215 --> 22:31.223
Was that kind of a score or something?

22:31.243 --> 22:32.205
I don't remember.

22:32.445 --> 22:32.645
All right.

22:32.685 --> 22:42.100
Then, for the day games, then what did you and your buddies do on Saturday night, if you didn't have a date?

22:44.071 --> 22:49.078
I don't know, must have gone to a movie or gone out to eat or something, or gone to Guyon Hall, I don't know.

22:49.098 --> 22:50.160
Guyon Hall was a dime.

22:51.181 --> 22:54.386
Sit in Guyon Hall and yell things out.

22:54.726 --> 23:01.015
I mean I was the type of, I'd probably sit there kind of gentlemanly like and sit and laugh at whatever else.

23:01.576 --> 23:04.881
Was campus theater any quieter than Guyon?

23:10.177 --> 23:13.120
Seems like they were both pretty rowdy, but funny.

23:13.140 --> 23:16.083
I must have been part of that, because I thought it was funny.

23:16.724 --> 23:19.867
And the things that were yelled were not obscene, were they?

23:19.947 --> 23:20.768
No, they were funny.

23:20.788 --> 23:29.417
They were like, I don't know, but they were male.

23:29.658 --> 23:32.461
They were male humor.

23:32.481 --> 23:35.644
I mean, this all-male school, and there was

23:38.037 --> 23:48.751
There was lots of talk about women and sex, but it just seemed natural and funny.

23:48.951 --> 23:50.853
There wasn't talking about girlfriends.

23:51.394 --> 23:53.376
There wasn't talking about sisters or moms.

23:53.436 --> 23:57.582
It was just kind of this great mystery of women out there that was talked about.

23:57.742 --> 24:00.265
Did you ever have a blind date from TSCW?

24:01.561 --> 24:04.084
Ah, yes.

24:06.047 --> 24:07.509
We played T.C.

24:07.549 --> 24:10.133
It must have been my junior year.

24:11.735 --> 24:15.240
It was not a great experience for me and not a great experience for her.

24:15.540 --> 24:16.461
How did you get the date?

24:19.005 --> 24:20.026
It was a blind date.

24:20.467 --> 24:27.096
Did you write one of those letters I've heard where you send it to the same box number up there?

24:27.228 --> 24:28.009
I don't know.

24:28.089 --> 24:30.111
I think it was a set-up date.

24:30.372 --> 24:52.358
I remember going to a dance on their campus, and then as best I can recall, there was adjoining motel rooms in Fort Worth, and there was like, oh, ten or twelve guys in one room and ten or twelve girls in the other room, and it was like

24:54.751 --> 25:03.051
I just—most of us, all I wanted to do was just go to sleep so the next—because, you know, there was lack of sleep and you wanted to get up the next day.

25:03.191 --> 25:07.602
It was not like anywhere near an animal house or orgy time.

25:07.622 --> 25:08.524
It was just—

25:09.668 --> 25:14.815
And you're inferring that you did not, a lasting relationship was not true.

25:15.155 --> 25:15.235
No.

25:15.255 --> 25:15.435
No.

25:15.455 --> 25:17.698
It was just, okay.

25:17.738 --> 25:24.427
And then the girls went back to TSU and we came back to College Station and that was it.

25:25.148 --> 25:27.210
And what time you need to leave?

25:27.571 --> 25:28.272
About 3.20.

25:28.632 --> 25:28.812
Okay.

25:30.995 --> 25:33.398
During your student years here,

25:34.289 --> 25:41.957
What were the extremes of drink and tobacco and so forth that students did?

25:44.580 --> 25:48.584
I remember one guy, a few people that were heavy drinkers.

25:48.624 --> 26:03.199
I remember one guy that was in our outfit when I was a freshman that used to come in drunk on most Friday and Saturday nights, and somewhere he got a metal desk that he pushed down the stairs from the fourth floor down, and the freshman had to carry it back up.

26:03.702 --> 26:04.803
What were they drinking?

26:04.903 --> 26:07.126
Was it beer, whiskey, or what?

26:07.146 --> 26:07.527
I don't know.

26:07.547 --> 26:08.428
I was never a drinker.

26:08.508 --> 26:10.390
I never paid much attention to it.

26:10.410 --> 26:13.594
Was there much traffic to Whiskey Bridge that you knew about?

26:15.296 --> 26:16.798
Seems like a lot of people talked about it.

26:17.418 --> 26:18.300
What about smoking?

26:18.360 --> 26:19.181
What were they smoking?

26:22.304 --> 26:27.010
Only cigarettes, but once in a while somebody might have a cigar.

26:27.800 --> 26:31.110
Were you and your buddies even aware of drugs?

26:32.554 --> 26:32.815
No.

26:34.460 --> 26:40.999
Even in the Marine Corps, my first tour in the Marine Corps overseas in 1966 was

26:42.194 --> 26:47.540
And I came back in 1970, and it was like, oh my gosh, what's all this?

26:47.620 --> 26:48.481
Things have changed.

26:49.642 --> 26:52.305
Different Marine Corps.

26:52.605 --> 26:54.988
I did not know the word heroin in that time.

26:55.168 --> 26:55.568
No.

26:55.889 --> 26:58.051
Illegal drugs was just, that wasn't part of it.

26:59.232 --> 26:59.913
Yeah.

27:00.714 --> 27:06.640
Was it even allowed for students to smoke in their room, smoke a cigarette in their corps room?

27:06.660 --> 27:07.101
I don't know.

27:07.161 --> 27:07.922
I imagine it was.

27:07.962 --> 27:09.163
I don't know.

27:09.143 --> 27:12.987
Let's see.

27:13.667 --> 27:16.010
We're about to finish this side.

27:16.490 --> 27:17.431
Let's see.

27:20.995 --> 27:22.596
When you traveled, you didn't have wheels.

27:22.616 --> 27:23.517
How did you get around?

27:26.200 --> 27:28.702
Well, my start of my junior year I had a car.

27:29.023 --> 27:30.784
Oh, okay.

27:30.824 --> 27:37.631
I remember my freshman year I hitchhiked all the way home at Easter from College Station to Billings, Montana.

27:37.791 --> 27:38.712
How long did that take?

27:39.907 --> 27:52.918
Um, let's see, I left here at noon time, and I, so that would have been, let's see, 20, it took about 36 hours.

27:52.938 --> 27:53.519
My goodness.

27:54.540 --> 27:57.422
Did you ever have a negative hitchhiking experience?

27:57.482 --> 27:58.343
Mm-hmm.

27:58.363 --> 27:59.504
And you did it in uniform.

27:59.804 --> 28:00.265
No, I didn't.

28:00.685 --> 28:02.046
I, I didn't civilian clothes.

28:02.066 --> 28:03.728
Oh, really?

28:03.748 --> 28:03.848
Yeah.

28:03.868 --> 28:07.311
Um, any amusing hitchhiking experience?

28:07.391 --> 28:08.732
No, I, I met, uh,

28:09.708 --> 28:17.481
I met Rick McPherson, who's class of 62, and I'm class of 65, and he was a senior.

28:17.521 --> 28:18.963
He was the CO of C-1.

28:20.085 --> 28:25.995
I knew he was in the Marine Corps program, but when he picked me up, he didn't know me from anybody.

28:26.785 --> 28:43.738
And during our time in the Marine Corps he was always three or four years senior to me and he's retired and working at A&M and here I'm back here and he still sees me and we still, you know, remember back to that time and we met and we've become fairly good friends.

28:46.884 --> 28:49.148
How did you communicate with your parents?

28:50.849 --> 29:03.860
From the time I came to A&M until all the way through my Marine Corps career, I always wrote my parents a letter on Sunday evening, whether I was overseas in Vietnam or whether I was a student at Texas A&M.

29:04.421 --> 29:09.085
I'd always get one letter a week back from each of them, big letter writers.

29:09.285 --> 29:12.128
Are any of those letters in existence?

29:12.148 --> 29:15.190
I have, yes.

29:16.251 --> 29:20.535
For goodness sakes, make copies for your family?

29:21.747 --> 29:25.791
and at some point share a copy with the A&M archives.

29:26.812 --> 29:27.794
Nobody has a journal.

29:27.874 --> 29:29.335
Nobody keeps a diary anymore.

29:30.196 --> 29:40.347
And if we had, think 50 years from now, your weekly letters, if you describe what was happening and what, think how important those could be.

29:42.069 --> 29:44.832
But, because you see, they may get thrown away.

29:44.872 --> 29:47.755
Like one of the things many of us are very, very worried about

29:47.735 --> 29:53.000
Mrs. Rudder is not being careful to keep Mr. Rudder's stuff together.

29:53.421 --> 29:54.822
She gives some of it.

29:55.003 --> 29:57.645
Occasionally a stranger will stop and talk her out of some of it.

29:58.826 --> 30:03.131
She gave two or three Eisenhower letters away not long ago.

30:03.992 --> 30:06.194
And her family is begging her, please, please.

30:06.735 --> 30:10.879
And of course, the best place would be the Cushing Archives because then they're safe forever.

30:13.382 --> 30:15.784
Let's see, did you make many phone calls?

30:17.165 --> 30:19.671
No, phones were expensive.

30:22.918 --> 30:25.625
Did you go with buddies home much?

30:26.547 --> 30:27.088
Yeah, I did.

30:27.108 --> 30:35.528
I remember going to Brownwood, going to Dallas, going to Beaumont.

30:36.757 --> 30:37.458
Houston.

30:41.362 --> 30:58.381
My grandparents lived in Palestine, so I could go up there and that was like, you know, you couldn't get enough sleep, the bed couldn't be fluffy enough that you couldn't eat enough food to keep them happy, you know, so it was a nice indulgence.

30:59.803 --> 31:03.507
Let's see, let's quit there and let you.
