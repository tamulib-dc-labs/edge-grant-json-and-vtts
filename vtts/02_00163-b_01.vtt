WEBVTT

00:05.212 --> 00:09.996
Okay, let's talk about the fire. Oh, yeah. As far as 
you, when was the, when did the building burn? It

00:17.623 --> 00:25.370
was 1979,

00:17.623 --> 00:25.370
I think it was February 28th. It was right at the end 
of February. And it began during the night. yeah

00:34.034 --> 00:58.928
apparently began early in the morning and some 
students i believe spotted it and called in the

00:34.034 --> 00:58.928
alarm may have been some students from hotard hall 
which is the next building over and i think they

00:34.034 --> 00:58.928
called in the alarm and the fire department came 
and and jack williams and Margaret were living in

00:59.583 --> 01:02.608
that apartment at the time. That of course was 
after Frank had retired, and he and Rosemary had

01:02.648 --> 01:21.161
gone to South Carolina, and so the students helped 
the Williamses get a lot of their stuff out, and

01:02.648 --> 01:21.161
the building was pretty much destroyed. When did 
you first here? Oh, it was while I was getting ready

01:24.405 --> 01:26.669
for work. I had just gotten up and I was in the shower 
and Chris came to the door and said, Margaret is on

01:26.769 --> 01:39.208
the phone and... Margaret Ingram. Margaret 
Ingram. And she says the press burned down. Of

01:43.715 --> 01:50.265
course, I immediately ended my shower and got out 
and got in the car and drove up here. And... What did

01:53.060 --> 01:55.123
it look like? Well, it was still smoking, of 
course, when I got here, and the hoses were still

01:55.583 --> 02:06.037
across the yard, and there was stuff all over the 
yard that the firemen had thrown out of the

01:55.583 --> 02:06.037
building. It was a real mess. You could tell the 
whole top floor practically was gone. The roof, of

02:11.764 --> 02:13.406
course, was all gone. And so we sort of stood in the 
yard with our jaws open and wondering what we were

02:14.527 --> 02:22.898
going to do. Was there anything, were you able to 
even get up to where your office was? Not at that

02:29.646 --> 02:30.547
time. Of course, the firemen wouldn't let us up for 
several hours until they got everything cooled

02:30.588 --> 02:38.737
down and they soaked things really good. Were the 
flames gone when you all got there? Was the

02:44.644 --> 02:46.066
building no longer flaming? Yeah, it was still 
smoking, but the flames were out.

02:56.611 --> 03:04.283
So we stood around there and waited until the fire 
department declared it was safe.

03:08.709 --> 03:14.438
I think we were able to poke around in some of the 
stuff they had thrown through the windows from the

03:08.709 --> 03:14.438
second floor. So we recovered some books and 
papers and manuscripts and stuff that they had

03:14.698 --> 03:25.234
thrown out of the second floor windows clear the 
way so that they could fight the fire and we found

03:25.855 --> 03:55.238
some stuff that we needed but then after we were 
able to go in we went up and started going through

03:25.855 --> 03:55.238
the rooms and and trying to salvage whatever we 
could and we carried carry it up and down those

03:25.855 --> 03:55.238
soaking stairs with the smell of charred wood and 
We

03:55.572 --> 04:01.580
did that for several days, just carrying stuff 
down. And we'd take it down to the warehouse,

04:01.960 --> 04:08.589
mainly files and manuscript pieces and things 
like that. We'd carry them down to the storage

04:08.629 --> 04:13.836
room, which was the old garage I mentioned 
earlier. And we'd lay wet paper out in the sun and

04:14.897 --> 04:24.229
weight it down with rocks to let it dry so that we 
could figure out what it was and what to do with it.

04:25.002 --> 04:37.396
We still have some papers in our old files, some old 
historical files that still have the water stains

04:25.002 --> 04:37.396
and little bits of insulation stuck to them. Did 
you lose any personal sentimental priceless

04:37.437 --> 04:43.564
items? No, I didn't. I

04:45.065 --> 04:50.672
didn't have anything that was Easily damaged. And 
my office, being in the back, wasn't burned. There

04:58.300 --> 05:00.423
wasn't really any flame back there. It was mostly 
water damage and wet plaster from the ceiling

05:00.443 --> 05:07.534
stuck to things. So the fire was worst in the west 
side, the front of the building? Right. Right. In

05:13.943 --> 05:16.727
the conference room area. And particularly on the 
southwest corner where Ray Grimala's office was,

05:17.213 --> 05:27.765
they figured that it probably started in the attic 
above his office. And the building was being

05:28.987 --> 05:42.883
remodeled, the inside was being remodeled, and it 
may have begun from work that was being done there,

05:28.987 --> 05:42.883
but nobody really knows for sure. Did you see, when 
you got there, were either of the Williamses

05:43.252 --> 05:47.397
around? No, I don't recall. I mean, we were all in 
shock. And I don't think so. By the time I got there,

05:56.067 --> 05:59.051
I think they were both gone. But I don't remember 
seeing them.

06:07.220 --> 06:12.246
But those first few days are pretty much a blur in my 
memory.

06:13.238 --> 06:19.785
in hindsight, could anybody identify some 
manuscripts that were totally destroyed?

06:22.347 --> 06:25.050
Yeah, we lost some things. I think the worst loss 
was some artwork for one of Bill Brett's books, one

06:27.292 --> 06:36.342
of his short story books. They were by a friend of 
his in East Texas, and they'd been laid out to for us

06:42.128 --> 06:46.712
to look at to see how they would fit with the story. 
Of course, they were irreplaceable, and they were

06:46.732 --> 06:50.435
all destroyed. And the original of Tom Lee's 
drawing of the logo, wasn't it damaged? The final

06:58.823 --> 07:02.807
one, it was not, because it was framed separately. 
But it was all the preliminary drawings he had done

07:03.447 --> 07:10.954
for the press logo, and they were all framed 
together in a large frame, And that was on the wall

07:11.727 --> 07:23.460
that apparently

07:11.727 --> 07:23.460
the water just streamed down that wall and into the 
frame and soaked everything, ran the ink and

07:11.727 --> 07:23.460
ruined it. But the other single drawing and letter 
was in a separate frame on a separate wall.

07:37.782 --> 07:47.274
We had a lot of papers and proof spread out on the 
table in Frank's office, which had been

07:37.782 --> 07:47.274
originally the board meeting room. And so we had a 
lot of stuff on that big table. And when the ceiling

07:55.105 --> 08:03.756
collapsed, this huge light fixture that was 
almost as long as the table and just as wide came

08:04.259 --> 08:10.149
right straight down on top of all those papers and 
protected everything on that table from the fire.

08:10.730 --> 08:14.636
So we pushed that light fixture off the table. 
There was everything that we had left, just

08:14.977 --> 08:17.982
perfect. Hadn't even been touched by the flames or 
the water. It had been protected by that huge piece

08:22.068 --> 08:25.173
of ceiling. Were there any

08:31.445 --> 08:37.811
particular

08:31.445 --> 08:37.811
artworks you remember that were destroyed?

08:40.773 --> 09:01.131
No, just the, just the,

08:40.773 --> 09:01.131
no, this was, it was Lloyd's office then, of 
course, and Lloyd had less artwork on his walls

08:40.773 --> 09:01.131
than Frank had had, because He only had a few 
photographs. Frank had a whole wall of

09:03.729 --> 09:08.560
photographs behind his desk of friends and 
authors. And if those had been there, those would

09:09.542 --> 09:13.290
have been destroyed. But Lloyd had not put up as 
much artwork. He did have one of those pewter

09:17.193 --> 09:25.344
centennial plates that the university had made in 
76. And we still have that in the vault, and about

09:26.746 --> 09:33.414
half of it is melted away with the pewter just kind 
of dripping off the edge. Oh, really? And that was

09:35.036 --> 09:39.302
on the wall behind the desk. So if anything, paper 
had been on that wall, it would have been charred or

09:39.362 --> 09:43.167
burned up. But no, the rest of the press, we lost a 
lot of reference books and business documents,

09:44.581 --> 10:02.882
orders that we were processing at that time, which 
were out on the desks, were damaged or destroyed.

10:04.243 --> 10:11.631
But I don't remember any other than those drawings 
by Bill Brett's friend. I don't remember of

10:11.731 --> 10:13.153
anything. valuable artistically speaking. We 
had a vault at the time. It was in that garage

10:17.887 --> 10:25.694
shipping room warehouse, and a lot of the artwork 
was in that vault. Now, you all moved things for a

10:25.714 --> 10:43.410
few days, the staff, the press staff did, and did 
the university offer to have people come over to

10:25.714 --> 10:43.410
help move, or did you all assume this yourself, 
feeling it would be better if you all did it?

10:46.360 --> 10:48.403
Well, people volunteered. Jerry Cooper was one of 
the people who volunteered and came over and spent

10:48.523 --> 10:54.953
long hours helping us carry stuff out. But it was 
mainly just the staff. About how long was it before

10:59.119 --> 11:04.047
you all began to do press work again? Well, of 
course, there were some things we had to keep going

11:05.289 --> 11:09.175
immediately. And we worked out of the warehouse. 
We set up phones and desks. salvaged the furniture

11:14.272 --> 11:18.818
that we could and put it in the warehouse. We moved 
books away from the west wall of the warehouse and

11:18.839 --> 11:28.192
used uh set the desks up along there and that's 
those were our offices. Describe that setup and

11:29.093 --> 11:33.439
about what size was that? Oh it was probably

11:38.757 --> 11:43.802
Well, it was wide enough to get two cars in, so it's 
at least 20 feet across. I think maybe it's even

11:44.162 --> 11:47.465
wider than that, probably like 30. It's probably 
about 30 by 40, something like that. Was it

11:51.770 --> 11:53.131
floored? Concrete. Concrete? Just bare 
concrete. And the walls were? Well, they were

11:58.616 --> 12:05.163
concrete block with wooden book bins built all 
along both sides. And the air conditioning and

12:05.443 --> 12:07.465
heating system? We opened the garage doors in the 
summer on warm days, I should say, because spring

12:08.542 --> 12:17.735
was coming along. It started getting warmer. But 
we had some cold days after that, too, and I

12:21.000 --> 12:29.792
remember sitting there in my heavy coat with a 
little electric heater blowing on my feet, and

12:21.000 --> 12:29.792
that was the heat. And the lighting? Well, we had 
lamps plugged into the desks, but it was basically

12:32.538 --> 12:39.544
just warehouse-style lighting hanging from the 
ceiling. And were there cords across the floor at

12:39.904 --> 12:44.929
the very end? Yeah. And was it divided into 
workspaces? There weren't any interior walls,

12:48.752 --> 12:50.614
were there? No, no. We just had our desks more or 
less organized by department. About how many

12:55.137 --> 12:58.380
people were working, how many individuals were 
working in there? A dozen? Well, yeah. all of the I

13:01.985 --> 13:27.992
think we're up to about 12 people at the time and

13:01.985 --> 13:27.992
of course they were trying to ship ship and and 
package books at the same time over on the other

13:01.985 --> 13:27.992
side now the the material that had been in the 
warehouse to begin with was not damaged that's

13:01.985 --> 13:27.992
right so the the books for shipment they were not 
Right. Just the stuff that was in the main

13:30.482 --> 13:32.805
building. Describe how Lloyd, as the director, 
how he handled this crisis. Well, he got

13:39.113 --> 13:53.232
everything organized pretty quickly and got the 
university to

13:39.113 --> 13:53.232
get us set up in that warehouse space.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.519
We were using the university's I'm not sure if we 
were using the university's computer system or if

13:59.478 --> 14:12.412
we were still working with the University of Texas 
Press, but at any rate, the computer services

13:59.478 --> 14:12.412
didn't break down.

14:15.515 --> 14:19.760
We just kept operating like we normally would. 
Now, in my interview with Mrs. Williams, she kind

14:20.661 --> 14:27.628
of felt that the university didn't do all that it 
could have done to help them move things and find

14:28.368 --> 14:32.874
things and so forth. Did you all feel that the press 
had been left out in that emergency? I think

14:39.923 --> 14:57.565
most of us were so wrapped up in keeping the books 
going and recovering what we could that

14:58.928 --> 15:03.354
I didn't really pay that much attention to what the 
university was doing. My feeling was that the

15:04.916 --> 15:21.519
university didn't react quickly enough in 
finding us an alternate space, because it was a

15:04.916 --> 15:21.519
couple or three months before we got the temporary 
trailers in. And then they moved those up once

15:24.882 --> 15:36.634
after they brought the trailers in, then they 
moved them up to another location, and then it was

15:24.882 --> 15:36.634
three years until we got the new building. Now, 
where? Four years, actually. Yeah, four years.

15:41.359 --> 15:43.301
Those trailers were put where? Well, they started 
out on the corner

15:44.662 --> 15:53.691
towards right across from where the University 
Mail Center is now, and was then. And then a few

15:59.323 --> 16:09.903
weeks later, they were moved up closer to 
University Drive on the corner next to Hotard

15:59.323 --> 16:09.903
Hall. And I'm not sure what the street is off 
University, but it's across from the old

16:10.744 --> 16:17.417
Methodist Church there on University. And you had 
how much of a trailer as your workspace? I had one

16:22.840 --> 16:25.724
desk and a room and a trailer. We had three big 
trailers and a

16:25.764 --> 16:36.277
small one. The big ones were, I think they were 
60-foot trailers. So these were like an

16:42.585 --> 16:47.771
18-wheeler pulls, that kind of trailer? Yeah, 
like a mobile home. Oh, like a mobile home, okay.

16:52.224 --> 16:54.848
Like a trailer you see at a work site. Okay. And 
these, and so they had heating and cooling. Right.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.363
Electric blowers. All right. And you shared a 
trailer with whom? Well, Lloyd's office was at one

17:09.189 --> 17:14.657
end, and Margaret's office was at the other end. 
And Mary Lynn, who was with us then, and I worked in

17:15.397 --> 17:21.767
the center section. We had two desks set in there. 
Right. Now, you mentioned Mary Lynn Dixon. She

17:26.355 --> 17:29.359
joined the press when compared to you? She started 
in, let's see, 78. September 78, I think. And you

17:37.481 --> 17:38.202
started? In 75. In 75. So she came three years after 
you. She'd only been with the press a few months

17:43.170 --> 17:46.596
when the fire happened. Oh, oh. All right, and 
Margaret Ingram stays till early? 81. 81. Early

17:53.748 --> 17:55.130
81. Okay. And then I became the managing editor 
then. just editor it was called. Describe what

18:03.781 --> 18:06.364
that promotion meant. Well that meant that I was 
doing more acquisitions and Lloyd was doing some

18:06.625 --> 18:29.076
but then I really started doing acquisitions and 
started working heavily and recruiting authors

18:06.625 --> 18:29.076
and getting manuscripts for the press and at the 
same time though I was still managing the copy

18:29.478 --> 18:39.151
editing and scheduling copy editors and 
scheduling projects going into production. When

18:39.331 --> 18:44.037
did you first begin to have copy editors report to 
you? Well, Mary Lynn did. When she came? No, in 81

18:48.323 --> 18:51.427
when I became the editing editor. She was 
reporting to Margaret before that. But not until

18:53.249 --> 18:54.591
then. Did you have others reporting to you? Right, 
right. Okay. All right. Then in 81, when that

18:59.746 --> 19:11.681
began, what kind of advising or prepping did you 
give to a new editor, new copy editor? Well, we

19:11.801 --> 19:19.070
didn't have any new copy editors until Susan 
Nessler came on in 84 or 85. What, wasn't Mary Lynn a

19:19.731 --> 19:21.473
new one? No, she was, she'd already, she started in 
78. Oh, in 78. Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay, oh, okay. But we

19:29.961 --> 19:34.568
had, we had an editing test that we gave 
candidates. Really? Yeah, and that's sort of

19:36.331 --> 19:42.921
frowned on by human resources now, but, but no, we 
required copy editor, prospective editor to come

19:43.357 --> 19:49.485
in and take a test and see how proficient they were. 
Can you describe any of the key questions? No,

19:54.652 --> 20:05.868
there were just samples of manuscript and lists of 
sentences that may or may not have needed

19:54.652 --> 20:05.868
correction of one kind or another. It was just to 
get an idea of how aware the person was of of English

20:12.314 --> 20:25.414
punctuation, grammar, and spelling, and also 
good judgment in how to deal with different styles

20:12.314 --> 20:25.414
and what to allow and what to question. Now, 
normally an editor has a what kind of degree

20:25.434 --> 20:29.560
background? Yours was journalism. Well, it 
varies much. You really can't say. I think most

20:36.811 --> 20:40.937
copy editors probably have a journalism or 
English background. But nowadays, there are so

20:41.913 --> 20:47.762
many different kinds of editors. They do so many 
different jobs. Acquisitions editors are often

20:50.286 --> 20:54.132
specialists in the field they acquire in. So 
there's as many different specialties as there

20:55.535 --> 21:05.811
are people, I think. Let's go back to, I forgot that 
Frank left before the fire. When did you all learn

21:13.391 --> 21:17.176
that he was going to retire, and how did you learn? 
Well,

21:17.616 --> 21:33.216
he hired Lloyd to come in as assistant director in,

21:17.616 --> 21:33.216
it must have been, it was in the summer of 77. So it 
was then that he announced that he was going to be

21:34.428 --> 21:38.853
retiring in another year. All right. So he did 
announce it. Yeah. And that Lloyd would come in and

21:41.195 --> 21:52.928
work with us for a year and then be the director, 
become the director, frankly. Now, Lloyd Lyman is

21:52.948 --> 21:55.631
L-Y-M-A-N. That's right. And he came from where? 
He was at LSU Press. But he had only been there for a

22:01.208 --> 22:04.572
year or two before he was hired to come here. And he 
was their number two man? Right. I think he was

22:08.557 --> 22:14.063
assistant director or perhaps editor in chief 
when he was there. Describe the last months of

22:14.704 --> 22:18.628
Wardlaw. Did Frank work at the same speed and 
effort as always? Oh, yeah. And in fact, even after

22:25.196 --> 22:30.422
he left and they moved to South Carolina, He took 
work with him and worked on a kind of a freelance

22:30.993 --> 22:38.245
basis after that, especially with art books. He 
put together two of the art series books after he

22:38.285 --> 22:43.293
had left College Station. If we could talk to him 
now and ask him what his favorite A&M Press book

22:45.497 --> 22:57.456
would have been, what do you think his favorite 
might have been?

23:03.359 --> 23:04.260
I don't know. I'd have to think about that. Would it 
be art, you think? I think so. I think so. Maybe.

23:14.570 --> 23:20.656
He always wanted Buck Shewitz to do another art 
book for us. Buck had done that series of prints of

23:20.996 --> 23:31.847
A&M campus, and

23:20.996 --> 23:31.847
Frank loved Buck's He always wanted Buck to do a 
book for us, but really the book never was, never

23:32.131 --> 23:41.745
got out until after Frank had left. Why not? Well, 
it was getting Buck Shewitz to do the work. And

23:48.816 --> 23:54.144
getting him to sit down and tell his story so that 
someone could transcribe it and write it up. And

23:55.065 --> 23:57.008
never did do that, I think. And was Buck living at 
the old board house while you were there? Right. He

24:04.374 --> 24:07.838
was directly downstairs from me at that time. All 
right, please share with this machine all the Buck

24:07.938 --> 24:11.543
Shewitz memories you have. Oh, Buck was such a 
character. First of all, describe him

24:15.988 --> 24:17.430
physically. What did Buck look like? Well, he was a 
stocky, white-haired fellow with a thick,

24:26.637 --> 24:28.840
German-Texan accent. He could hardly understand 
him sometimes. He had such a thick accent. I think

24:33.005 --> 24:37.551
he put a lot of it on, and a lot of people speculated 
on that. But it fit him perfectly, his

24:37.751 --> 24:42.938
personality. He liked to mix up his English words 
and get them all confused. And

24:49.066 --> 24:55.935
his office was directly below mine, and so I saw him 
a lot. And he'd be down there drawing and

24:57.299 --> 25:09.691
say hello to him as I came and went, and visit with 
him a little bit. But he wasn't always there. He did

25:14.697 --> 25:20.122
quite a bit of traveling, even while he was 
supposedly in residence in College Station. And I

25:22.004 --> 25:26.108
remember one time when a particular TV series was 
coming on. I told Buck that my wife and I wanted to

25:29.206 --> 25:39.301
see that with our daughter, because it was a family 
kind of TV show that was coming on. And Buck had this

25:40.263 --> 25:44.569
huge, I guess for those days, it was huge. Must have 
been a 27-inch TV set in his suite. And he said, will

25:51.424 --> 25:54.367
you all come down and use it? I'm going to be gone. 
You can use my suite and watch that show. And so we

25:58.291 --> 25:58.851
did. We went into Buck's suite and watched the show 
on TV one night. And he had a workspace there, and he

26:04.757 --> 26:13.105
had a table. He didn't keep a lot of his artwork out 
unless he was actually working on it. And if he

26:21.487 --> 26:29.075
didn't like what he was doing, if he was 
disappointed or unhappy with something, he would

26:21.487 --> 26:29.075
tear it up and throw it away. And so occasionally 
you'd see in the trash can, you'd see these

26:30.376 --> 26:38.964
crumpled, destroyed pieces of paper with this 
wonderful stuff on it. And I often wished that I

26:40.285 --> 26:43.328
had... had the guts to ask him for some of that 
before he crumpled it up and threw it away.

26:50.740 --> 27:14.040
Sometimes, though, he would deface something 
before he threw it away by, like if he was doing a

26:50.740 --> 27:14.040
beautiful building, architectural rendering of 
one of the central Texas German homes or

26:50.740 --> 27:14.040
something, and he messed up on it, in his opinion, 
and made a mistake, well, then he would... I would

27:14.898 --> 27:18.883
do a cartoon of a jet airliner flying over it, 
something like that. I'm shaking my head because

27:20.245 --> 27:25.592
the same thing I'm saying to myself, why, why, why, 
nothing else? Didn't I go over there and go through

27:25.973 --> 27:27.755
the trash? Now, as far as you knew, while he was 
there in residence, for whom was he doing those

27:29.277 --> 27:38.410
works of art? Were they to sell to anyone? Yes, 
right. And I think he sold fairly regularly. I

27:49.848 --> 27:53.374
don't know how hard he tried. I know he had patrons, 
people who almost collected his art. I think the

27:58.962 --> 28:01.205
Lindsay's did that. And I know there's other 
people around the state who have good collections

28:02.006 --> 28:09.758
of Buck Shewitz's work. Now, his wife was deceased 
by then. i think right well no she she was she was not

28:12.813 --> 28:40.997
deceased she was hospitalized oh okay and he was 
living there in that right in the in the suite where

28:12.813 --> 28:40.997
he downstairs from where he did the art right uh 
where did he eat his meals do you know i think he ate

28:12.813 --> 28:40.997
at sabisa and he ate with frank and roseberry on too 
did he have a car during that time did he even drive I

28:43.407 --> 28:44.849
think he did have a car.

28:49.213 --> 28:50.835
Yeah, I think he was still driving. Now, on 
occasion, I know that Buck drank too much. Did Joel

28:54.920 --> 28:57.743
ever have any experience of his? I never did. You 
didn't see him pass down anything? No. He wasn't

29:02.688 --> 29:08.014
there more than a year, a year and a half. after I got 
here. And then he went back to, I believe,

29:10.080 --> 29:12.962
Wimberley. And he had a little place there where he 
lived and worked. Was he a congenial neighbor? Oh,

29:22.411 --> 29:22.871
yeah. For you all? Yeah, sure. He was great. He was 
just a wonderful man. And our daughter was only

29:29.457 --> 29:36.043
four or five years old then, and everybody You 
know, she attracted people, and

29:37.002 --> 30:00.040
Buck was one of the people who thought she was just a 
little doll, and so he would always say something

29:37.002 --> 30:00.040
to her, and

29:37.002 --> 30:00.040
Frank and and Rosemary treated her like one of 
their grandkids. Let's see, we haven't described

30:05.187 --> 30:07.490
Rosemary. We haven't talked about her much. Well, 
Rosemary is just the perfect other half for Frank,

30:09.212 --> 30:15.260
I think. She loved to read, but she wasn't a person 
who was interested in making books herself or

30:16.261 --> 30:27.296
doing any writing herself. But she... kept the 
home for Frank and was perfect hostess for the

30:30.378 --> 30:43.315
kinds of things that Frank enjoyed, getting 
people together and talking and enjoying their

30:30.378 --> 30:43.315
company. Now, when they lived downstairs below 
the press, did she come upstairs much? Not very

30:50.805 --> 30:51.505
much. Didn't see her upstairs very much. And did 
Frank normally go downstairs to eat lunch? Oh,

30:56.712 --> 30:57.313
yes. he'd go downstairs for lunch and maybe to um to 
take a little nap after lunch and then he'd be back

30:57.530 --> 31:22.660
up around two o'clock probably did he ever bring 
any desserts or anything from downstairs up to

30:57.530 --> 31:22.660
serve the group i don't think so i don't recall that 
once

30:57.530 --> 31:22.660
in a while um
