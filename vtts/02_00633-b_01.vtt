00:07.304 --> 00:20.080
Do you agree with the idea that the grant giving 
agency should be primarily located in

00:07.304 --> 00:20.080
Washington?

00:20.100 --> 00:22.427
I hadn't thought about their location, but I think 
I think if I had to make a judgment, I would say yes.

00:28.317 --> 00:30.520
They should all be in Washington. Well, again, the 
general feelings of many oceanographers is that

00:30.540 --> 00:42.216
there ought to be multiple agency granting in 
Washington, D.C. itself, because that's close to

00:30.540 --> 00:42.216
the heartbeat of Congress.

00:45.861 --> 00:51.469
Would you accept that idea, that it's necessary to 
be close to the seat of power, if I may use that word?

00:56.225 --> 01:00.052
Well, I suppose it helps you when it comes time to 
testify before Congress. But I don't think it's

01:00.794 --> 01:05.483
the key issue. To me, the key issue is that if all of 
the granting agencies are in Washington, they can

01:13.825 --> 01:21.756
work better together to support each other and 
their cause on the Hill and the research

01:13.825 --> 01:21.756
scientists. I think if you're way out in another 
part of the country, even though the flying time is

01:21.777 --> 01:38.421
short, you begin to lose awareness of what other 
agencies are doing and where the gaps are from a

01:21.777 --> 01:38.421
management point of view and where the 
opportunities are. How much interchange would

01:39.182 --> 01:43.528
you have with ONR, for example, on a grant? Well, we 
have a lot of interchange with them. They invite us

01:51.672 --> 01:58.519
to all of their site visits, and where possible, 
all of our program managers participate. We can't

01:58.539 --> 02:00.981
do it all because it's a very heavy travel 
schedule. They participate in our proposal

02:01.222 --> 02:05.446
review panel meetings. In general, we have a great 
deal of interaction

02:06.147 --> 02:10.911
with them. Our closest contact in the past has been 
with them.

02:18.862 --> 02:25.654
Do you agree with the idea that the grant giving 
agency should be primarily located in

02:18.862 --> 02:25.654
Washington?

02:31.604 --> 02:33.968
I hadn't thought about their location, but I think 
I think if I had to make a judgment, I would say yes.

02:39.862 --> 02:42.045
They should all be in Washington. Well, again, the 
general feelings of many oceanographers is that

02:42.065 --> 02:53.763
there ought to be multiple agency granting in 
Washington, D.C. itself, because that's close to

02:42.065 --> 02:53.763
the heartbeat of Congress.

02:57.428 --> 03:03.077
Would you accept that idea, that it's necessary to 
be close to the seat of power, if I may use that word?

03:07.799 --> 03:11.645
Well, I suppose it helps you when it comes time to 
testify before Congress. But I don't think

03:12.386 --> 03:17.053
it's the key issue. To me, the key issue is that if 
all of the granting agencies are in Washington,

03:17.734 --> 03:34.279
they can work better together to support each 
other and their cause on the Hill and the research

03:17.734 --> 03:34.279
scientists. way out in another part of the 
country, even though the flying time is short, you

03:34.715 --> 03:50.029
begin to lose awareness of what other agencies are 
doing and where the gaps are from a management

03:34.715 --> 03:50.029
point of view and where the opportunities are. How 
much interchange would you have with ONR, for

03:50.830 --> 03:58.777
example, on a grant? We have a lot of interchange 
with them. They invite us to all of their site

04:03.250 --> 04:05.795
visits. And where possible, all of our program 
managers participate. You can't do it all because

04:10.243 --> 04:12.648
it's a very heavy travel schedule. They 
participate in our proposal review panel

04:12.908 --> 04:15.834
meetings. In general, we have a great deal of 
interaction with them. Our closest contact in the

04:22.647 --> 04:25.512
past has been with ONR. partly because some of us 
came from ONR and we knew the people who were there,

04:26.133 --> 04:32.800
partly because they're right here in town, and 
partly because we support the same people.

04:37.764 --> 04:46.953
We had some coordinating committee set up between 
us and ONR when they were at NRL. Now that they're in

04:48.195 --> 04:51.398
Mississippi, we don't have any arrangements. And 
we really need to set up. some arrangements in a

04:55.327 --> 05:03.817
formal way just to make sure that we do something 
periodically. If you don't have what says I've got

05:03.857 --> 05:12.267
to get together with ONR on a certain day and talk 
about things, you never get together with them

05:03.857 --> 05:12.267
unless they're passing through town. I haven't 
been to Mississippi since 1970

05:12.347 --> 05:21.357
or something like this. And so I think 
communication between the funding agencies is

05:21.397 --> 05:24.861
very important. I think we could do a better job if 
we knew what EPA was doing. But we don't know what

05:28.395 --> 05:30.297
EPA is doing. And it's very hard to find out. It's so 
hard to find out that

05:33.760 --> 05:43.809
we don't even bother, which is kind of a sad 
commentary.

05:49.974 --> 05:54.038
My impression is that more and more agencies are 
going to be funding projects dealing in and around

05:49.974 --> 05:54.038
with oceanography and the atmosphere. rather 
than fewer. Do you think there's any likelihood of

05:56.478 --> 05:59.161
any simple direction? But it does people like 
Gordon Lill who argue for simple direction

05:59.182 --> 06:19.831
maintain that that would bring in more 
cooperation from one of

05:59.182 --> 06:19.831
these agencies.

06:19.851 --> 06:21.493
I'm really not sure about that. I've never seen 
central coordination, at least thus far, work in

06:23.178 --> 06:31.667
the federal government. I suppose if there were an 
oceanographic czar, it would work. But I'm not

06:36.412 --> 06:40.836
sure that's healthy for oceanography. So I guess 
I'm not overly enthusiastic about central

06:41.457 --> 06:46.502
coordination. This was done, I believe, when the 
Weather Bureau was established. And for a while, I

06:53.350 --> 06:55.972
guess it was pretty nice. All the weather bureau 
activities were located in one place, and they

06:57.033 --> 07:02.018
served all the agencies and met their needs. But it 
didn't take long before some of the agencies had

07:02.038 --> 07:13.808
needs that could not be met by this group, like 
maybe the Department of Agriculture or FAA.

07:15.930 --> 07:22.075
And so pretty soon, these other agencies were 
establishing their own meteorological programs

07:22.645 --> 07:24.307
to meet their own needs. And I think it's a natural 
state of government. If an agency needs a basic

07:32.158 --> 07:36.644
research component, it should be allowed to have 
it. If it needs a mission-oriented research

07:36.784 --> 07:41.170
component, it should be allowed to have it. It 
should have to justify it, of course, but at least

07:41.210 --> 07:50.863
the responsibility for doing the work that that 
agency wants doing lies on its own shoulders

07:41.210 --> 07:50.863
instead of on some other agency over here which has 
its own fish to fry.

07:58.089 --> 08:02.862
And I take it you'd be opposed to the so-called 
czarist approach to oceanography? I would be,

08:02.882 --> 08:04.988
yeah. It's almost as if oceanography is on the 
verge of, let me say, another breakthrough in

08:06.908 --> 08:14.280
funding.

08:16.944 --> 08:31.427
Some people argue that the IGY created a massive 
funding program for oceanography, and they're

08:16.944 --> 08:31.427
very optimistic demands of cleaning up the 
environment will create one for them. Is this the

08:31.447 --> 08:34.772
way you perceive it, having worked and going to 
work?

08:39.106 --> 08:43.632
I'm not sure that it's about to have a breakthrough 
in funding.

08:46.435 --> 09:08.843
I think the problem in the past has been that in 
spite of the fact that the advocacy group for

08:46.435 --> 09:08.843
oceanography has not been very large, it has been 
vocal enough so that oceanography has fared

08:46.435 --> 09:08.843
reasonably well in the scientific field. 
programs of the agencies. I think now that the

09:13.390 --> 09:20.557
number of advocates is increasing at a great rate. 
We're going to exploit the outer continental

09:21.538 --> 09:25.562
shells. We're going to face the problem more and 
more of waste disposal. We're going to have power

09:31.187 --> 09:33.509
plant siting. The whole thing has made a large 
number of people aware of the oceans and the fact

09:37.493 --> 09:44.162
that the oceans are important, and this never 
existed before. So, you know, if the number of

09:44.283 --> 09:55.258
advocates has any impact on the funding, then I'd 
say we should have a funding breakthrough within

09:44.283 --> 09:55.258
the next five years or so. But I'm not sure whether 
or not. Any particular politicians you'd like to

09:58.483 --> 10:02.809
cite for aiding funding in oceanography?

10:06.029 --> 10:07.030
Oh, yeah, sure. I think Miller of California was a 
strong supporter. I think Jackson of Washington,

10:16.423 --> 10:23.894
before he got into other things, was a strong 
supporter. And his staff was. Certainly Hollings

10:27.438 --> 10:30.262
has been. And

10:30.302 --> 10:35.209
Pell, who has had a strong impact on the 
establishment of the Sea Grant program.

10:43.509 --> 10:45.791
And those are the ones that stand out in my mind. I'm 
not a great politician, so I don't keep track of it

10:47.072 --> 10:54.580
too well.

10:54.600 --> 10:58.704
When Sea Grant was established, what sort of 
reaction did you go through? What kind of contact

10:58.724 --> 11:02.968
did you have with the establishment of Sea Grant?

11:06.627 --> 11:10.852
I didn't have any contact with the establishment 
of Sea Grant.

11:19.602 --> 11:20.963
I didn't really have a reaction. I have a very slow 
reaction time to some of these things. And

11:26.209 --> 11:34.018
it took me several years to get concerned about 
whether it grew. or collapsed or did anything else

11:34.387 --> 11:39.633
because we were busy with our own program. I have 
been convinced for the past four or five years,

11:41.374 --> 12:01.896
though, that it's a very important program and 
that it needs to expand and needs to take an

11:41.374 --> 12:01.896
appropriate place

11:41.374 --> 12:01.896
in the same way the Department of Agriculture did. 
in those states that border the oceans and need to

12:02.787 --> 12:07.734
deal effectively with the oceans. So I'm a very 
strong supporter of the Sea Grant program. Well,

12:11.480 --> 12:29.065
both the previous questions I was trying to pose in 
terms of multiplicity of funding is that can you

12:11.480 --> 12:29.065
think of anything like another program like Sea 
Grant or something that would interest other

12:11.480 --> 12:29.065
congressmen towards oceanography that should be 
done?

12:29.085 --> 12:30.347
Or do we have enough agencies?

12:33.230 --> 12:37.974
Enough interest in Congress.

12:37.994 --> 12:43.179
Oh, I don't think you can have too many interests at 
Congress.

12:53.168 --> 12:54.189
There are some problems. Some of the problems that 
I mentioned earlier could stand a strong

12:54.609 --> 13:02.376
leadership from but not necessarily in a new 
agency, but in one of the existing agencies. I

13:07.730 --> 13:13.976
think the marine pollution program is one that is 
just drifting. NOAA has a responsibility for

13:15.177 --> 13:17.059
monitoring. I think for the first time last year, 
it got some money to set up a monitoring scheme.

13:24.065 --> 13:31.232
There is no, EPA has so many problems on the 
continent and in freshwater that it's concerned

13:24.065 --> 13:31.232
about saltwater is negligible. There just isn't 
anybody who has both the concern and the resources

13:35.897 --> 13:44.631
to do anything about marine pollution 
monitoring. And I think, you know, I think NOAA

13:45.652 --> 13:53.524
could do it if Congress had given the mandate and 
the money in a stronger term.

14:00.710 --> 14:15.864
The exploitation following the Iron Continental 
Shelf is so difficult that I don't have any

14:00.710 --> 14:15.864
recommended procedure for tackling it. BLM has an 
absolutely impossible chore, and they're

14:17.406 --> 14:24.773
getting pinged on from anybody that you want to 
mention. There's nobody that they've been able to

14:24.793 --> 14:27.135
make happy. And I'm not sure they can make anybody 
happy. So they're under fire, and they've got a

14:31.270 --> 14:36.438
tremendous big program in terms of dollars.

14:39.683 --> 14:43.809
I think someone should turn the management of that 
thing upside down. But I don't think it's in the

14:43.950 --> 14:48.036
technical direction of it. I think it's in the way 
that the Department of Interior chooses to

14:48.096 --> 14:58.392
negotiate these contracts for baseline studies 
and this sort of thing.

15:01.190 --> 15:04.133
Maybe it's the only way they know, but I think it 
could stand a good shakeup. I think that's a big

15:04.994 --> 15:11.482
part of the

15:04.994 --> 15:11.482
problem. I don't know about the deep sea 
exploitation. I think it's still a decade or two

15:17.269 --> 15:19.852
away. And in

15:19.892 --> 15:29.543
large measure, the problems are more political

15:30.282 --> 15:34.767
than technical, scientific. Let me pose the 
question another way. Other people maintain just

15:37.831 --> 15:50.626
as vigorously that with rapidly rising 
inflation, that funding for hard science

15:37.831 --> 15:50.626
projects will become less in the future rather 
than more. Do you have, I know that that's

15:50.646 --> 15:55.392
obviously something we all oppose, but do you hear 
any rumors of this sort? Any feelings that this may

15:55.472 --> 15:58.095
have?

16:00.826 --> 16:05.253
No, it's certainly something to be concerned 
about. And

16:05.493 --> 16:22.579
it's certainly going to cut back on the

16:05.493 --> 16:22.579
expansion of hard sciences.

16:22.599 --> 16:28.588
Well, I don't get any signals that we're in for a 
disastrous cutback. in the hard science support,

16:30.374 --> 16:34.343
at least in NSF and as far as I know, anywhere else.
