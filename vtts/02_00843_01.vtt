00:03.203 --> 00:04.184
April 1, 1976. This is Tommy Moorhead, 9-11 Lazy 
Lane, Bryan, Texas, by Roger Ferguson as part of an

00:04.224 --> 00:14.917
oral history project, the Bryan College Station 
area. Tommy, how long have you been in this area? I

00:19.883 --> 00:23.067
was born and raised here, so in June it will be 23 
years. 23 years. How about your descendants? How

00:26.170 --> 00:28.333
long have they been in this area? On my mother's 
side, for as long as we know of, I know for a fact that

00:28.735 --> 00:37.306
my great-grandfather homesteaded here in the 
Steep Hollow area. We have some proof that they

00:38.908 --> 00:42.773
were here in this general area. I don't know 
exactly where since prior to the Civil War. We've

00:45.476 --> 00:53.847
got letters that have been sent back to some of our 
relatives that we've kept from that day. Why did

00:55.649 --> 00:57.932
they come to this area? why they chose this 
particular area to settle in? They were

01:01.966 --> 01:04.169
homesteaders looking for land. They were 
primarily farmers and chose the St. Paul area

01:04.730 --> 01:13.643
right outside what is today Brown and College 
Station as prime farmland and decided to settle

01:04.730 --> 01:13.643
there. So they were mostly farmers, is that right? 
That's correct. Later on, though, my grandfather

01:18.590 --> 01:24.579
was in the dairy business when my mother was a 
child. And raised dairy cattle and sold milk in the

01:26.077 --> 01:29.242
general area here. How about your ancestry? 
Moorhead, what kind of name is that? Moorhead is

01:36.374 --> 01:38.718
Indian. My father's from East Texas. He didn't 
come to this area until 1946, although he did have

01:40.641 --> 01:48.394
some relatives here earlier.

01:48.914 --> 01:52.320
In fact, his aunt, who is my great-aunt, was the 
first woman sheriff in Texas. Oh, really? Her

01:57.200 --> 02:07.636
husband, who was named Leonard Moorhead, who my 
father is named after, was sheriff here in the

01:57.200 --> 02:07.636
early 1900s. And at one time, he had caught a 
fugitive and had him sent to prison. And in the

02:15.929 --> 02:17.852
courtroom, the... person stood up in court and 
vowed that he would get my uncle. And so later on he

02:23.463 --> 02:38.984
had been sent to an insane asylum and he escaped 
from there and was out at the old steep hall of

02:23.463 --> 02:38.984
church one night and snuck up in the bushes and put a 
pistol up to the window and shot my uncle in the head

02:23.463 --> 02:38.984
and killed him. That's not really funny. I know 
it's not. It's a bit unusual though. Anyway, he

02:46.823 --> 02:59.842
killed my uncle and my aunt, whose name she 
remarried later and may be found in some of the

02:46.823 --> 02:59.842
documents of history that are in brine today. Her 
name was changed to Lila Withers later on. And Aunt

03:04.128 --> 03:16.206
Lila swore out revenge on this particular person 
and loaded up a posse and went out and captured him

03:04.128 --> 03:16.206
and brought him back into town and he was sent away 
once again to stay. And my aunt took over and filled

03:20.080 --> 03:29.854
my uncle's shoes as sheriff of Rhyne and became the 
first woman sheriff in the state of Texas and then

03:20.080 --> 03:29.854
was later elected in her own right to be sheriff of 
the town. She tells a lot of stories. She just died

03:31.396 --> 03:37.866
about a year ago now in her mid-90s, I guess it was. 
And she used to tell me stories as a child of, she was

03:38.727 --> 03:42.733
sheriff during Prohibition And she would go down 
the streets of Bryan and confiscate all the

03:43.642 --> 03:53.836
whiskey that was being bootlegged and pour it down 
the streets of Bryan, as she said. So they all liked

03:54.477 --> 03:55.758
her pretty well? I mean, she didn't meet with any 
resistance for being a woman sheriff? No, in fact,

04:00.044 --> 04:02.808
I guess you could say she was one of the first 
women's laborers. But she enjoyed being a

04:03.929 --> 04:06.713
sheriff. enjoyed it quite a lot. She liked law 
enforcement. And the women and men of the town

04:10.577 --> 04:13.981
accepted her as such. And she did a very fine job. 
Right before she died, about five years ago, she

04:15.503 --> 04:34.328
was honored in Bryan and received a plaque and a 
medal and everything, showing that she was the

04:15.503 --> 04:34.328
first woman sheriff and that the historians of the 
town did appreciate her contributions to the

04:15.503 --> 04:34.328
city. That's pretty interesting that they would 
accept her so readily. It seems like all the people

04:39.785 --> 04:44.977
at Bryan and College Station are somewhat on the 
conservative side. You know, a woman's place is in

04:45.017 --> 04:46.360
the home. Is that basically, would you say, the 
character of most people that live in Bryan? Would

04:52.794 --> 04:54.638
you say it's a conservative area? Yes, very much 
so, particularly Bryan more so than College

04:55.192 --> 04:58.837
Station. I think a lot has to do with the College 
Station, the education influence and the vast

04:58.857 --> 05:12.778
mobility of the people in College Station tends to 
make it a more liberal area, whereas Bryan is a more

04:58.857 --> 05:12.778
conservative area. I know when I went to school 
here, you could tell that by the school systems,

05:13.282 --> 05:28.916
that Bryan was a much more conservative school, 
say for instance, just in their dress code,

05:13.282 --> 05:28.916
whereas College Station's dress code wasn't 
nearly as defined as Bryan's was. In fact, they

05:28.976 --> 05:36.602
even slipped to not even having one, I believe, 
during the later years. You graduated from A&M, is

05:37.203 --> 05:39.645
that right? Yes, in 75. And what was your degree in? 
English and history with a teaching certificate

05:43.184 --> 05:46.450
education. A teaching certificate. Do you know 
much about the educational facilities or early

05:47.853 --> 05:55.408
education programs in Bryan College Station 
areas?

05:58.354 --> 05:59.396
Not a whole lot. I know in talking with my mother 
when she was growing up, she's now in her late 40s.

06:07.468 --> 06:15.018
And when she was a young child, for instance, they 
did have country schools out in St. Paula and

06:07.468 --> 06:15.018
around the surrounding communities. And in fact, 
she even had to start school a year early because

06:15.038 --> 06:19.163
she was the only one her age. And they didn't want to 
have just one person in first grade. So she had to

06:22.207 --> 06:26.573
start at age five and go in with all the six year 
olds. I know Fannin, which is now an elementary

06:27.110 --> 06:30.915
school, used to be the high school. In fact, she 
graduated from Stephen F. Austin, although it was

06:30.955 --> 06:38.285
in the Fannin building at that time. The new high 
school in Bryan, was that built when you graduated

06:38.905 --> 06:42.510
from there? Did you graduate from Bryan High? No, I 
graduated from Stephen F. Austin. From Stephen F.

06:45.774 --> 06:47.056
Austin. I was in the last graduating class in May of 
71 from Stephen F. Austin.

06:53.519 --> 07:05.110
Then we integrated after that, and Kemp was the 
black high school and Seminole-Austin the white,

06:53.519 --> 07:05.110
and we integrated and joined forces at Brown High. 
And joined forces. Did that particular

07:06.791 --> 07:11.516
integration, did you have any problems? Like, 
say, you know, the big race riots in Houston. How

07:14.719 --> 07:20.404
did the people here take the integration of the 
schools? with mixed emotions, I guess I could say.

07:25.564 --> 07:42.862
I don't know if it was directly from the 
integration itself, but I know that the school

07:25.564 --> 07:42.862
system as a whole, the teaching of the material and 
everything, or the material that has been taught,

07:25.564 --> 07:42.862
has lowered. And the standards, I think, of our 
education have been lowered by a deal. I don't

07:48.068 --> 07:51.792
think it's nearly as good as it used to be. That's 
interesting. Are there any particular reasons? I

07:57.687 --> 08:02.753
mean, you know, why you don't think it's as good as 
it used to be? Did they just slow the whole process

08:03.694 --> 08:10.923
down, or, you know, can you say? Well, I really 
don't know. I know I went back and taught for a while

08:11.884 --> 08:22.656
after I graduated, but I

08:11.884 --> 08:22.656
don't know if it's completely to do with the 
integration or not, But I know the whole attitudes

08:23.412 --> 08:26.397
of the students have changed. It may just, quote, 
unquote, the new generation, although I hate to

08:26.437 --> 08:33.490
think that a new generation is coming up and I'm 
getting that old. But now we don't have dress

08:35.854 --> 08:40.061
codes. The kids can come to school as long as 
they're not indecently exposed. And I think that

08:46.463 --> 08:51.410
takes away from the rigidness of a school system. 
And it's not all bad, but yet at the same time, I like

08:51.450 --> 08:56.497
the more formal education. Maybe it's because of 
my conservative upbringing from this area.

09:04.027 --> 09:05.149
How about you personally? Do you have any 
particular reason for choosing the Bryan College

09:05.349 --> 09:11.357
Station area you need to live in? I really didn't 
choose when I was born into it. Do you ever feel like

09:15.282 --> 09:18.006
you'd like to get out? Yes, I'd like to continue my 
education and get my master's. So my master's

09:23.173 --> 09:27.600
should be finished in May of 77. And I do think that I 
would like to move and become, I want to stay in the

09:29.923 --> 09:41.460
university system since I've been here and I've 
got my assistantship working in student affairs.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.441
And I'd like to be a somewhere working either as an 
assistant dean of students or somewhere in

09:43.147 --> 09:53.859
student personnel work at some other university, 
but I think that I need to get away and get some new

09:43.147 --> 09:53.859
and different ideas. It is a good town. I may 
eventually come back here, but still being young

09:55.862 --> 10:05.453
and single, as I might say, I would like to do a 
little bit of exploring on my own. From your study

10:06.153 --> 10:08.496
of the Bryan College Stationery Do you know of any 
particular catastrophes or tragedies, anything

10:08.898 --> 10:17.474
like this that's happened that might be 
interesting?

10:17.855 --> 10:28.073
Well, in the early years, I know we've had 
pneumonia epidemics that killed out a lot of

10:17.855 --> 10:28.073
people and things like this. But in my own 
lifetime, I can remember... what we call the big

10:33.080 --> 10:40.148
fire, which was the Montgomery Ward building 
downtown burned. I can't remember the exact year.

10:42.811 --> 10:44.333
It was probably in the early 60s.

10:47.096 --> 10:57.167
It burned, and to me it seemed like that was the 
first step in the death of downtown Bryan because

10:47.096 --> 10:57.167
this was the first major move. The fire was, there 
was no way to control it, Everybody in the town just

10:59.776 --> 11:02.079
stood around and watched it burn. It was a huge 
building. In fact, the lot is still vacant. There

11:05.863 --> 11:07.505
was nothing ever rebuilt there. And Montgomery 
Ward's moved out to where it is now. And Manor is

11:11.850 --> 11:13.452
small. And I think that was the coming of the malls 
and the beginning of the death for downtown of

11:13.492 --> 11:18.758
towns and cities. Were there ever any days where 
the downtown of Bryan was the teeming

11:19.579 --> 11:29.310
sub-metropolis, I guess you'd say, like you see in 
the movies? you know, of, like, gun smoke. You

11:33.286 --> 11:35.589
know, can you visualize that? You mean way back in 
history? Yeah. Oh, yeah, I've got pictures from my

11:38.252 --> 11:42.496
grandparents. And I can remember my grandparents 
talking about loading up the wagon. And it took

11:50.545 --> 11:52.387
forever, I guess, in a wagon. I know that right now 
they're about five miles out of the city limit, but

11:52.488 --> 11:57.373
I guess to downtown Brine it would be about... 10 
miles or so, and I guess it did take quite a long time

11:57.995 --> 12:01.600
to come into town. But we've got pictures where the 
wagons and the people are just all over the streets

12:02.300 --> 12:09.630
of Brown. And even as a kid, before we went to this 
mall system that I think our society has gone to

12:10.050 --> 12:22.245
with the various stores at different locations in 
the city, as a child, downtown was the place to go.

12:22.265 --> 12:23.547
That's where all the stores were. You had your 
local drug store that had its soda fountain. You

12:29.146 --> 12:35.093
had the Woolworth's store and just everything 
focused around downtown. I noticed some of the

12:35.113 --> 12:41.140
buildings in the Bryan downtown area are fairly 
old buildings. Do you know anything about the

12:41.160 --> 12:50.471
architecture of the area or any particular 
buildings in the history of Bryan College Station

12:41.160 --> 12:50.471
that would be interesting?

12:51.633 --> 12:53.635
I know that, okay, like, Some of the banks had some 
of the old buildings. If I'm correct in thinking, I

12:56.918 --> 13:15.943
think that the City National Bank, what's now out 
on Texas Avenue, and there was a semi-modern bank

12:56.918 --> 13:15.943
in downtown Bryan, and if I'm correct in my 
thinking, they also had one of the old buildings. I

13:15.963 --> 13:24.634
believe it's where ANCO Insurance is now, and you 
can still see engraved on the building in the

13:15.963 --> 13:24.634
stonework the name of the bank. Talking about 
architecture, though, there's an interesting

13:25.475 --> 13:40.113
story that my dad has told me that there are two very 
large, well, there were two very large homes here

13:25.475 --> 13:40.113
called the Aston States. One of them that a lot of 
people might know was WC's on Texas Avenue. It was

13:46.401 --> 13:49.645
an old estate that was turned into a club. The Aston 
brothers came here years and years ago and sort of

13:55.563 --> 14:00.949
made a rivalry between the two brothers just to see 
who could build a better house. And one Aston

14:01.629 --> 14:07.756
estate was on Texas Avenue, and the other Aston 
estate is back on 25th Street. And they decided to

14:09.278 --> 14:12.501
see who could build the better home. And in looking 
at the two, the one on 25th Street won out. Hands

14:20.189 --> 14:20.870
down. Right. It was really a fine house. What was 
that? or the professions of the Aston brothers. Do

14:27.077 --> 14:29.441
you know what they did? They dabbled in a little bit 
of everything. In fact, Parker Aston Hardware

14:31.965 --> 14:40.881
store that is still here was begun by one of the 
Aston brothers. And while we're talking here, I'm

14:41.803 --> 14:46.090
thinking of other little stories. Go out ahead. 
Brazos Briscoe, Mr. Briscoe told me this himself.

14:53.410 --> 14:58.275
He was a real good friend of my dad's, and I'm sure 
anyone that's familiar with the area. Is this the

14:58.635 --> 15:00.657
Briscoe lumber? Mm-hmm. They were of Italian 
descent and raised cotton out in the bottom, and

15:03.180 --> 15:11.448
that's where they made most of their money, right 
there. Anyway, Mr. Brazos came up. over here from

15:16.495 --> 15:44.730
Italy with very little money and at one time one of 
the Aston brothers really got on his back and

15:16.495 --> 15:44.730
cheated him out for being a no good Italian with no 
money at all and really gave him a hard time and Mr.

15:16.495 --> 15:44.730
Brazos vowed that someday he would own everything 
that the Aston brothers ever owned and as Mr.

15:16.495 --> 15:44.730
Brazos built up his cotton industry and began 
selling cotton everything like that, he

15:44.997 --> 15:53.806
gradually picked up and bought everything that 
the Astin brothers ever had, except for one thing.

15:54.907 --> 16:10.684
Mr. Briscoe died very suddenly about five or six 
years ago, and the only thing that he had lacked

15:54.907 --> 16:10.684
buying was the Astin estate over on 25th Street, 
and it's just because Mrs. Astin had outlived him

16:11.272 --> 16:15.038
And she soon died about six months after Mr. 
Virisco did. And the stay has since been taken care

16:16.000 --> 16:20.247
of by the trustees at the bank. That's an 
interesting story. You said that Mr. Virisco was

16:24.834 --> 16:27.779
Italian. Is that pretty much a trend? Were there 
many Italian immigrants in this area? Yes, we've

16:34.542 --> 16:37.005
got a lot of people of Italian descent. You can tell 
by the names, Scamardo, Ruffino, Restivo,

16:37.085 --> 16:43.272
Berisco, Scamardo. We've got them all. We've got a 
lot of Italians here. I think the majority of them

16:46.796 --> 16:52.603
were in the cotton industry, which was a very big 
industry here. In fact, we've still got a lot of

16:55.326 --> 16:58.009
cotton down the bottom today. We also have a lot of 
people of Spanish descent, which I'm sure has been

17:03.517 --> 17:06.081
due to people moving out of Mexico and moving 
north. Then we've got, like, my mom is Scotch

17:08.004 --> 17:16.819
Irish, so we have people of that descent also, and 
just a whole mixture. But we do have a strong

17:16.839 --> 17:23.871
Italian and Spanish influence here.

17:24.672 --> 17:29.440
You mentioned the fact that the Ashton brothers 
made a lot of their money in cotton. And it was one

17:30.078 --> 17:32.241
time a thriving business here. Are there any other 
businesses that you can think of that were? Well,

17:35.024 --> 17:37.307
Vrisco was the one that made cotton. Oh, Vrisco 
was? Vrisco's the one that made cotton. Okay. I'm

17:39.290 --> 17:41.273
not really sure where the Aston started. They may 
have started cotton also. But I do know them, like

17:42.935 --> 17:47.541
the hardware store and many other things. And I 
believe a lumber company also. Let's see, other

17:48.302 --> 17:49.664
industries.

17:52.307 --> 18:00.017
Cotton and farming and cattle primarily, I think, 
before you get into the more industrial type thing

17:52.307 --> 18:00.017
of the 20th century. Of course, now we've got 
several industries in more modern times.

18:10.478 --> 18:17.086
You mentioned Lila Withers was a famous person in 
your background. Do you have any others? Maybe not

18:18.608 --> 18:25.397
in your particular background, but particular 
individuals that you know of? that may have left

18:26.693 --> 18:30.157
their mark on the area. Yeah. In fact, I've got one 
relative that I'm very proud of. I'm sorry you

18:34.543 --> 18:36.185
hadn't done a little bit better. I don't know if 
you're aware of it or not, but my name is Tommy Lee

18:36.205 --> 18:47.439
Moorhead, and the Lee has a very significant 
purpose for being in my name. On my mother's side,

18:48.020 --> 18:53.747
we are direct descendants from Robert E. Lee, And 
one child out of every generation carries the

18:54.487 --> 18:59.916
middle name of Lee. I carry it. Then my uncle, my 
mother's older brother, was named Alan Lee. And

19:05.124 --> 19:07.448
then my grandfather's name is Roy Lee. And it just 
goes on back. All the way down. Were your

19:10.573 --> 19:18.145
descendants, well, not your descendants, I guess 
your predecessors, were they involved in the

19:10.573 --> 19:18.145
Civil War? Did they fight? I know you mentioned 
something about your... You had a letter or

19:21.368 --> 19:23.351
something? Yes. We were definitely pro-South. 
Pro-South. We were definitely Southerners and

19:26.856 --> 19:28.699
rebels. The war of northern aggression. Right. 
Yes, let's see. I've got to figure this out now.

19:39.035 --> 19:44.944
We have a letter that was sent to my great-aunt's 
mother. So would that be my great-great-aunt?

19:48.790 --> 20:11.001
great-aunts mother yes I don't know it was my 
great-aunts mother her husband was away fighting

19:48.790 --> 20:11.001
in the Civil War and wrote a letter back to her and 
her oldest daughter at that time we called petty

19:48.790 --> 20:11.001
she was just a small baby and he was writing back 
saying how much he missed her and everything, how

20:11.335 --> 20:22.908
the world was going, and that he missed his wife and 
Patty

20:11.335 --> 20:22.908
very much. What would you say is the chief means of 
livelihood for most people in the Bryan College

20:23.069 --> 20:38.046
Station area after the farming and ranching of the 
early years? What would you say during the 1920s?

20:41.356 --> 20:45.382
during that age around World War I? We didn't have 
very much industry as such. Like so many people

20:49.708 --> 20:56.418
were so conscious of the war effort and helping 
supply things for the war. But I guess just small

20:57.319 --> 21:05.170
businesses and we do still have a lot of cotton and

21:07.900 --> 21:11.563
farming going on around the edges of the community 
here. I guess I should say city we're growing so

21:12.204 --> 21:15.007
much. It was a good area for people to get a start. I 
know my dad came here without a high school

21:18.750 --> 21:27.598
education or high school diploma and was able to 
start his own store and build it up. He started in 46

21:27.778 --> 21:31.281
and so he's celebrating his 30th year of business 
now. And he's been able to build it up to a

21:32.463 --> 21:37.367
corporation and be a very successful businessman 
And it was a very good area and very appealing to

21:37.938 --> 21:44.686
people that wanted to start out and do something on 
their own. What business is your father in? He's in

21:48.010 --> 21:49.953
the glass business. He has Acme Glass Company 
incorporated in the area. You mentioned the war

21:54.959 --> 22:01.707
effort and people all geared toward the war. Do you 
know anything about this that you could tell us?

22:05.832 --> 22:08.475
Not really specific, so I'm sure that... I'm 
talking about World War I or World War II. It

22:11.878 --> 22:13.439
doesn't matter. Okay, I know they took people, 
like my grandfather went to World War I. I really

22:13.820 --> 22:27.793
don't know if the area did anything for a specific 
cause except exist and try to make it through both

22:13.820 --> 22:27.793
wars. During the Depression, I know here a lot was 
done to... The farmers were the ones that really

22:36.072 --> 22:45.345
made out the best and furnished food for other 
people. In fact, the farmers, it's similar to the

22:45.525 --> 23:01.086
Waltons, I guess you'd say, because they always 
had plenty to eat, never much money, but plenty to

22:45.525 --> 23:01.086
eat, and it was a good time to bargain with the store 
people with food rather than money. Kind of switch

23:01.106 --> 23:02.328
tables on them. Mm-hmm. This year is, as you know, 
the bicentennial, a lot of celebrations and

23:05.722 --> 23:11.467
things going on like that. Can you remember any 
celebrations in particular, Bryant area, big

23:11.487 --> 23:18.034
shindigs? Well, unfortunately, this is a very 
mixed community. I mean, it's fortunate. I don't

23:23.198 --> 23:23.539
know. We've got a lot of influence from a lot of 
different background cultures, but we're not so

23:23.559 --> 23:35.610
much like a completely German community like, for 
instance, New Braunfels has their worst fest and

23:23.559 --> 23:35.610
everything. But I do remember one celebration 
that was a lot of fun for me as a child. I was about

23:41.332 --> 23:43.895
nine years old, I guess. I don't remember the exact 
year. I should because I've lived here all my life.

23:48.302 --> 23:50.384
But Brian celebrated their centennial. And you 
could go to the merchants and get wooden nickels.

23:56.953 --> 24:01.800
And then on one special night, or it was really 
about a week, I guess, there, We dressed up in

24:02.489 --> 24:04.994
centennial costumes. One particular day, I can 
remember, was the official celebration day. We

24:11.226 --> 24:13.390
dressed up in our centennial clothes. The women 
wore centennial dresses with the hoops on. In

24:15.895 --> 24:17.318
fact, it was the first time I wore a hoop. Don't ever 
try to sit down in a hoop dress. You end up catching a

24:20.164 --> 24:23.350
hoop right in your face. We dressed up in our, you 
know, costumes and everything and had a real good

24:24.072 --> 24:36.666
time and you could buy things with the wooden 
nickels and the men had to grow beards and we had a

24:24.072 --> 24:36.666
jail out in the street and we had a street dance. And 
it was a lot of fun. People rode their horses in the

24:37.747 --> 24:39.729
town. It was a good, fun celebration. In fact, I can 
remember thinking I wish I could be, you know,

24:44.174 --> 24:49.219
around for the next centennial because it seems 
like I would have gotten more out of it. However,

24:52.556 --> 24:55.259
I've been too old to get very much more out of it. But 
it was something that I really had a lot of fun and

24:55.879 --> 24:59.403
enjoyed. It was neat. You talked about how 
conservative this area has generally been

25:01.665 --> 25:09.873
historically. What factors can you name or give us 
that would seem to support this? Well, the whole

25:19.540 --> 25:23.726
South, I think, really is conservative. Texas is a 
fairly conservative state, I think. So that is a

25:28.332 --> 25:31.376
lot from where it stems. In this particular 
community, though, I think we had two very severe

25:32.557 --> 25:45.615
impressions from the standpoint that, okay, we 
had A&M, which was a military school here, that

25:47.047 --> 25:49.310
started, as everyone well knows, in 1876. And then 
also later, later too, we had another military

25:51.273 --> 26:01.288
school that was founded by Nat Allen called Allen 
Military Academy. And this was not exactly a

26:01.308 --> 26:15.990
reformatory school, but it was a military school 
as such that went from the sixth grade through, it

26:01.308 --> 26:15.990
was a, I can remember it being a, junior college. It 
took you to the first two years of college and then a

26:18.040 --> 26:23.670
lot of people transferred from Allen over into 
A&M. But now it's just from the sixth grade or it

26:23.690 --> 26:39.938
changed then from the sixth grade to twelfth grade 
and now it's just a private school more so than a

26:23.690 --> 26:39.938
strict military school. Where was this located? 
It's over in North Bryan, about on 22nd Street,

26:41.958 --> 26:49.651
because we lived on 23rd when I was very, very 
young. That was when my parents first lived, after

26:49.671 --> 26:53.077
they got married. And it was about four blocks from 
our house. It's still there today. Is it an

26:56.603 --> 26:58.847
all-male type? Mm-hmm. When it was military. Now 
it is open, and it's co-educational. And it's all

27:03.575 --> 27:08.362
grades starting even in elementary school, I 
believe, now. It's simply a private school. And a

27:10.845 --> 27:19.157
lot of, I know when we had immigration, a lot of 
parents put their children into Allen. But of

27:19.237 --> 27:25.266
course, students still come from all over the 
world and go to Allen Academy. Speaking of, you

27:26.067 --> 27:31.955
know, the educational institutions, of course, 
the biggest one in this area is college here. And

27:32.416 --> 27:33.177
what... What effect do you think that the school 
has had on the Ryan College Station area?

27:44.406 --> 27:49.711
Well, I'm most familiar with the effect that the 
school has had on the area, I guess, since Earl

27:44.406 --> 27:49.711
Rudder was president. In the past, I know it had a 
varying effect on the area in the fact that it did

27:50.752 --> 28:02.843
supply a nine-month population boom every year. 
although it wasn't much back then, but it still was

28:02.992 --> 28:13.702
an input of people that helped the businesses in 
town with their selling of merchandise. They were

28:13.722 --> 28:17.165
good customers to everyone. But even more so now, I 
think it has helped make Bryan College Station a

28:17.185 --> 28:25.652
spot on the map. As it changed from a college into a 
university and became more diversified, and has

28:31.747 --> 28:32.988
grown larger. It has brought an intense

28:33.589 --> 28:39.074
amount of students here. It's brought a lot of 
faculty and staff. It's really helped the

28:42.498 --> 28:52.247
community go, not so much from the educational 
standpoint, but I think a lot, too, from the

28:42.498 --> 28:52.247
research that is carried on here. It's brought a 
lot of people here into the area. And as we have more

28:55.330 --> 29:01.416
here, I've noticed more industry come in, for 
example. like more business forms. Well, we've

29:04.594 --> 29:07.038
had a Linco here for several years. We've had 
International Shoe Factory here for years. A lot

29:10.744 --> 29:13.548
of industry is coming into the area. We've had our 
industrial park set up in the last three years.

29:17.414 --> 29:18.055
Hold on there. What's bypassed? I guess maybe the 
last ten years, really. Time seems to fly so much. I

29:24.986 --> 29:27.370
really don't have all my dates straight, but... It 
has grown in my lifetime considerably. I can

29:31.328 --> 29:34.533
remember they used to say, in fact, it's still on 
the street signs. I think it's supposed to be four

29:34.573 --> 29:38.240
or five miles from College Station to Bryan. I can 
remember when there was that definite, distinct

29:38.260 --> 29:49.218
difference where Piggly Wiggly and A&W Root Beer 
and all these things used to stand. It was country.

29:51.143 --> 29:54.907
there weren't businesses and homes everywhere 
like there are today. Was Texas Avenue still where

29:54.967 --> 29:57.269
it is, though? Was it still the main road that 
connected the two? Yeah, but it used to be a lot

30:00.452 --> 30:02.053
skinnier. Was it paved? Yeah, well, I'm sure a long 
time ago it wasn't, but as long as I can remember, it

30:05.557 --> 30:10.842
has been paved. But, for instance, the street that 
we live on now, which now is right in the heart of a

30:10.862 --> 30:19.750
residential area, I can remember more.
