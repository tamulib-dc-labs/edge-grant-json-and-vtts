WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:08.289
My

00:02.680 --> 00:08.289
name is Darlene Baker, and I'm a student at A&M. And 
I am interviewing Miss Margie Presnell for an oral

00:08.489 --> 00:15.600
history interview in my class, cultural 
geography. OK. First question. Were you born

00:20.127 --> 00:21.368
here? And if not, how did you arrive? And why did you 
pick this area? I was born and raised here in Brazos

00:25.675 --> 00:28.079
County. And I was born in the southern part of the 
county. picked this part because my parents had

00:32.414 --> 00:37.922
always lived here and continued to live here. And 
in those days, children did not go away from home to

00:38.002 --> 00:41.507
work. They stayed home and worked with their 
families. That's perfect. Go ahead. Is that it?

00:48.437 --> 00:49.238
Why did you stay? Well, we stayed at home with our 
parents because in those days, children did not

00:51.261 --> 00:57.730
have the opportunity to take vocational nursing 
or anything of that sort in the schools, because I

00:58.807 --> 01:07.817
went to a one-teacher school, and we just didn't 
have those kind of opportunities. So we just lived

01:07.837 --> 01:16.688
at home with our parents, all lived in one big happy 
family, and all worked together. Okay, I'm going

01:16.708 --> 01:17.789
to stop it right here.

01:21.113 --> 01:28.341
Okay, Ms. Cresno, what other family lines are you 
related to in the surrounding area? Well, I have a

01:28.844 --> 01:36.921
sister, the Arnolds, that lives here, and a sister 
that is deceased, and her family is still living

01:28.844 --> 01:36.921
here, and they are the Allens.

01:40.909 --> 01:50.228
And I have a nephew, Robert Baker, that has a ranch 
out here, the other side of Curtin, and they are

01:40.909 --> 01:50.228
here quite often. Come here quite often. Okay. 
Were there any disasters that you remember, such

01:53.652 --> 01:58.459
as floods, storms, or droughts, anything like 
that? And Brian? Well, I remember the storm of

01:59.820 --> 02:08.853
1914, which was a terrible storm, and it was very 
destructive. And at that time, my daddy was not

02:09.593 --> 02:12.437
working. He was working on a ranch at another 
place, and we'd come home over the weekend. And my

02:17.063 --> 02:18.966
mother was always afraid of, winds, you just 
couldn't stand them. And I know that storm blew so

02:21.917 --> 02:26.911
hard, it even blew our wagon away from the house. It 
took it down across the prairie, and it just tore up

02:26.952 --> 02:30.702
everything. And I was sitting in the bedroom 
looking at some pictures, I was just 12 years old,

02:35.078 --> 02:38.642
and things like that didn't excite me. So I was 
sitting there looking at those pictures, and Mama

02:38.782 --> 02:46.011
came in and said, Margie, quick, didn't you see 
that big tree fall? It almost hit the house. And

02:48.714 --> 02:50.075
says, we're going to the barn. We had just finished 
a new log barn. And so I said, you think we ought to

02:53.519 --> 02:55.702
go? She said, yes, we need to go. Says, we've got to 
get out of here. So I went out there, and just as I

02:58.966 --> 03:04.292
went in the barn door, the top came off. of the barn 
and just barely missed my head. Boy. And so we were,

03:07.878 --> 03:13.989
of course we all had to go back to the house then 
because we didn't have any shelter over us. Boy,

03:14.009 --> 03:14.970
that's a miracle. So it was just really a tragic 
thing. And Papa came home so upset because

03:17.495 --> 03:21.842
everything was just torn to pieces. And it just 
ruined everything around the farm. What kind of

03:25.946 --> 03:27.129
storm was this? Was this a hurricane or something? 
Kind of like that. High winds and rain. Yeah, real

03:30.637 --> 03:32.000
strong winds. Yeah, storm of 1914. Yeah, and it 
just about tore the place down? Yeah, it sure did.

03:37.552 --> 03:38.835
Was there a lot of damage in Bryan? Now, I wouldn't 
know about Brian because, you know, then we didn't

03:39.440 --> 03:45.849
have radios and things of that type, and we lived 
out in the country. All righty. Okay. What changes

03:48.954 --> 03:55.404
in technology have you seen, like, you know, 
transportation and farming, help irrigation,

03:48.954 --> 03:55.404
advantages in getting to the market? Well, 
there's been lots of changes. Now, when we lived on

03:57.847 --> 04:08.343
the farm and worked on the farm, all we had to work 
with was mules and walking plows, walking

03:57.847 --> 04:08.343
cultivators, and even oxen. We... We had a pair of 
oxen that we drove and plowed. That's really neat.

04:14.397 --> 04:15.239
I think that would be exciting. I would like to try 
that. Well, I have done it. I know they were named

04:18.023 --> 04:22.269
Coley and Brown. And Uncle Lewis, he would hollow 
wool Coley. And that old oxen knew where to go and

04:26.796 --> 04:29.500
what to do. But nowadays, everything is done by 
machinery. That's tractors and machines. hay

04:35.667 --> 04:39.832
balers and hay rakes and all that kind of stuff 
where we had to do that by hand. Y'all had to do more

04:39.852 --> 04:42.054
of a lot of hard work. Yeah, we even cut our own corn 
tops. We didn't waste anything. Pop had us save

04:46.038 --> 04:47.400
everything. We cut our corn tops and shocked them, 
stacked them up in a point like and let them dry and

04:47.440 --> 04:56.870
then take them in to feed the cows in the 
wintertime. Y'all must have had a lot of crops,

04:56.890 --> 04:58.912
right? Yeah, we raised practically everything we 
ate except the staples. like sugar and flour, and

05:03.511 --> 05:06.414
even ground our own meal. We had a great big, what 
they called then, a potato bank that was built out

05:06.494 --> 05:13.362
of logs with dirt over it. And then we'd put straw in 
there, inside of it. And it had a door to it. And we

05:17.647 --> 05:24.494
would store cushions, and turnips, and potatoes, 
and all that kind of stuff. We killed all of our

05:24.514 --> 05:28.939
meat, and cured our meat, and had our lard. We even 
made our syrup. And all that kind of thing. We had to

05:33.764 --> 05:39.674
do that all by hand, except, of course, that we had a 
certain mill that squeezed the juice out of the

05:33.764 --> 05:39.674
cane, you know. And it was driven by a mule. Y'all 
rode horses, right? Yeah. How far out of Bryan did

05:45.544 --> 05:46.706
y'all live? Well, we just didn't come to Bryan. 
When we went, we went to Navasota. We were closer to

05:50.372 --> 05:52.015
Navasota. And we lived about... I guess about six 
miles north of Millican. We lived at what you call

05:59.360 --> 06:02.927
the Peach Creek Community. And that's the way that 
we did everything. We did it the hard way. But we

06:08.617 --> 06:10.240
enjoyed it. I bet y'all did. That's the only thing 
y'all knew. Yeah. The only thing I didn't like to do

06:16.715 --> 06:17.656
whole sweet potatoes. It was really hard. Did 
y'all have to get up in the morning real early and

06:20.240 --> 06:23.505
milk the cows? We got up and milked about 15 cows 
before we went to school every morning. Y'all must

06:28.894 --> 06:29.875
have got up early. Yeah, had to. Of course, we lived 
right near the school. We were lucky to live near

06:32.719 --> 06:34.662
the school. And of course, those days, we had to 
take our lunch. Some of us would get up and help Mama

06:37.066 --> 06:41.677
fix, you know, cook the stuff for lunches and 
things. And she was always so good to always have

06:41.738 --> 06:47.051
donuts and things of that kind for us to carry. And 
she always kept something sweet cooked. And an old

06:49.435 --> 06:53.501
fellow came around with an old Baptist preacher. 
And he sold apples. And we traded him butter for

06:54.663 --> 06:57.687
apples. And we kept that. You know how we kept our 
butter cold? We had a big dug cistern. And we would

07:03.756 --> 07:11.066
let that butter down, put it in gallon buckets, and 
let it down with a rope and leave it in that water so

07:03.756 --> 07:11.066
it would stay cold. Oh, that's neat. We didn't have 
refrigerators then. No refrigerators. No. We

07:14.692 --> 07:16.995
didn't have electricity. Yeah. And the job, okay, 
advantages in getting to the market, you said by

07:19.078 --> 07:23.004
horse or whatever? Well, the only way you had to go 
then was horse and wagon. Right. And nowadays,

07:26.429 --> 07:32.839
people have trucks, have hardtop roads, and have 
cars, and it's just all the difference in the

07:26.429 --> 07:32.839
world. Okay. When did you start using modern 
appliances? Well, where I lived, after I married,

07:39.166 --> 07:44.313
I lived at the Tabor community. And we didn't have 
electricity out there until 1937, when the REA

07:44.454 --> 07:51.163
came out there. They got the REA organized and put 
electricity to the rural communities. And that

07:58.874 --> 08:02.980
was the first time we'd had any was in 1937.

08:05.153 --> 08:05.634
1937. That was a long time ago. I bet that was really 
exciting, y'all getting that, right? Yeah. I'll

08:12.373 --> 08:13.596
never forget it. They went to town and bought a used 
radio, and they played Bing Crosby. Until

08:20.763 --> 08:23.549
midnight, I never got to start singing my life. Oh, 
yeah. Well, y'all had photographs? Or, I mean,

08:26.997 --> 08:29.563
what do you call them? Those old record players? 
Y'all didn't have that until the electricity came

08:31.748 --> 08:33.572
in? Well, you could have those. You'd wind them up. 
Wind them, right. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

08:48.674 --> 08:51.218
We didn't have any natural gas. And then after we 
had electricity, we got the butane gas for cooking

08:52.300 --> 08:59.373
and heating. And those were kind of heaven sent to 
us because we lived out in the rural areas where we

09:00.575 --> 09:07.607
had to use coal oil cook stoves. And they had one 
fireplace in the house, and you couldn't warm a

09:08.268 --> 09:12.876
house that way. How did y'all heat yourselves? I 
mean, keep that place heated? We had that one

09:15.955 --> 09:17.437
fireplace. Did y'all all sleep around that 
fireplace? No. Or what? What did y'all do, just

09:19.360 --> 09:21.583
cover it in blankets? Mm-hmm. We just got cold. Oh, 
I bet that was uncomfortable. It was.

09:30.396 --> 09:31.157
Next question. What was a normal day like, and what 
did you do, and when did you go, and what travel to

09:32.639 --> 09:41.091
various places?

09:43.670 --> 09:58.852
Well, my normal day was pretty hectic sometimes, 
because I had several babies and children to take

09:43.670 --> 09:58.852
care of, and had to get up about 5.30 in the morning 
or 6, because we had to fix all the lunches for the

09:43.670 --> 09:58.852
children that were in school. And by the way, I had 
been, when I married, I had been in school all my

10:00.174 --> 10:05.983
life. I had started school when I was five, and as 
soon as I got out of school, I took the teacher's

10:06.063 --> 10:12.112
examination and taught. And that was two years of 
college, right? And then I went to college and had

10:13.741 --> 10:16.043
two years. Oh, okay. And then, of course, when I 
married, I had a stepson then. He was ready to start

10:20.528 --> 10:25.093
school that year, so therefore I was in school 
continuously. So the days were really full. And,

10:28.497 --> 10:32.441
of course, we did everything the hard way. I had to 
wash with the tub and rub board and things of that

10:32.942 --> 10:38.027
type, you know, and carry in wood. And just 
everything that could be done had to be done

10:38.935 --> 10:42.160
manually. There's no machinery at all to do 
anything. A lot of labor put in that. You bet. And it

10:48.611 --> 10:49.894
was hard labor, too. And traveling, we did have 
vacations occasionally with my sister, Ms.

10:50.915 --> 11:00.792
Baker, and her husband. Only time we ever went 
vacation was when we went with them. We always went

11:04.002 --> 11:05.023
together. Where'd y'all go? Well, we went to the 
centennial, the year they had that, at Dallas. And

11:11.170 --> 11:19.159
then we went to San Antonio one summer, and we went 
to all those parks and zoos and things of that type.

11:19.199 --> 11:28.990
And then we went to Mineral Wells, because that was 
where Mr. Baker, your granddaddy, had lived at one

11:19.199 --> 11:28.990
time. And so we went there one week and spent the 
week. And every time we went, well, we went with

11:33.795 --> 11:35.977
them. We went to Galveston and we went to places 
like that. Did you ever go far out of state or

11:39.500 --> 11:42.483
anything like that? No, not then we didn't. The 
only time I've been out of state was when your

11:43.784 --> 11:51.671
grandmother and I, Ms. Baker, went on that bus tour 
about five years ago. And we went all up in Canada

11:51.711 --> 11:56.415
and Alaska. Not Alaska. We didn't go to Alaska. We 
went to Canada. And went to New York, went to

11:59.868 --> 12:03.924
Washington, DC, and went through, oh, I don't have 
any states. But that's beautiful. Canada's

12:04.687 --> 12:05.470
beautiful. Yeah, and it's so clean. And we just 
enjoyed it so much. We were gone three weeks. and

12:11.427 --> 12:13.811
went to Nashville and went to the Grand Ole Opera. I 
heard that is really something to see. And went to

12:16.196 --> 12:17.378
the Upper Room. Well, they tell me that the old one 
wasn't nothing compared to this new one. You know,

12:22.006 --> 12:24.230
they built a new one and have the opera laying. And 
this lady told me just a while ago that it was better

12:24.851 --> 12:28.578
than any Disney World. Oh, really? I'd like to go up 
there sometime. That's nice. We're hoping we can

12:32.004 --> 12:35.410
go this spring or this summer. All righty. What 
were the designs of the houses like, and how do they

12:38.651 --> 12:41.734
differ from today? They can, you know, know. Put 
some of that down.

12:52.663 --> 13:05.515
Well, houses in those, in the old days, were so much 
different from ones they are now because most of

12:52.663 --> 13:05.515
them were built with two rooms across the front and 
a long front porch or else two rooms and a big

12:52.663 --> 13:05.515
hallway down through the middle and They had no 
closets, no storage space, no bathrooms.

13:12.495 --> 13:20.582
And way back there, when you had to take a bath, you 
had to bring a wash tub in, heat your water on the

13:12.495 --> 13:20.582
stove, which was a wood stove at that. And we just 
didn't have any hot water, any convenience at all.

13:26.007 --> 13:28.309
And now the houses are so different. They are made 
all modern. Everything is push buttons now. With

13:32.973 --> 13:35.755
every convenience needed, central air and heat, 
Telephones, intercom, and you name it, the new

13:36.477 --> 13:42.545
homes have it. Right, more modernized and 
everything. And they're much warmer than the

13:45.148 --> 13:54.841
houses, the old houses, you froze to death in them 
because they were so high up off the ground, and the

13:45.148 --> 13:54.841
windows, people didn't know how to build houses in 
those days. Did y'all have any fireplaces

13:54.861 --> 13:57.164
upstairs also? No, we just had one upstairs. The 
basement, did y'all have any basements? No. No

14:01.891 --> 14:03.192
basement. Huh. And the house set up about two and a 
half feet off the ground. I remember the kids used

14:07.236 --> 14:10.519
to play, you know how they used to play with these 
little cars? Right. That's where they played,

14:10.879 --> 14:12.541
under the front porch. Underneath the front 
porch, right. So they had to get where there was

14:13.742 --> 14:16.505
some dirt, because we had grass on the yard. These 
houses have a lot of, were they more, had columns in

14:17.185 --> 14:21.109
the front, or what? Some of them did, yeah. Some of 
them did, or more like that? Yeah. All wooded?

14:24.552 --> 14:25.172
Yeah, all wooded. All wooded, and high seeding. 
Yeah. They were high seeding? Yeah, they really

14:28.095 --> 14:28.936
were. They said that made them cooler in the 
summer. It also made them cooler in the winter.

14:32.719 --> 14:33.720
That's right. Okay.

14:37.826 --> 14:40.509
What schooling did you have, and how does it differ 
from today? Well, the school I went to was a

14:42.812 --> 14:55.469
one-teacher school, and we didn't have any bus 
system or anything in those days, and we were

14:42.812 --> 14:55.469
fortunate enough to live close to the school. It 
was just right outside of our Pasture Gate, we just

15:00.008 --> 15:02.631
lived right at it. I guess it wasn't a mile even. The 
school? To the school. Well, that's good. And we

15:06.336 --> 15:12.684
just had a one-teacher school and went through the 
seventh grade at that time. But then later, we

15:12.704 --> 15:19.953
built a two-teacher school in the community, and 
it went through the eighth grade. And so I worked

15:20.674 --> 15:25.780
hard, and I studied at home and everything to... 
learned enough that I could pass a teacher's exam.

15:31.166 --> 15:37.797
In those days, you could go for the county board and 
take a teacher's examination and get your

15:31.166 --> 15:37.797
certificate. And that's the way I taught, was I got 
me a certificate that way. And then I went to

15:41.583 --> 15:45.048
college two years after I started teaching. I 
saved my money and went. Each year I'd go to

15:46.971 --> 15:48.594
college. And

15:49.235 --> 15:53.522
it is It's very different today, because children 
have so many advantages going to school. Right.

16:00.480 --> 16:01.682
They can carpool. They can carpool, or in 
countries, they own the bus line, maybe. Right,

16:05.869 --> 16:07.551
get a bus. Do y'all ride horses? Education is one of 
the best things you need in life. OK. What was it

16:13.841 --> 16:17.367
like during the Depression?

16:24.198 --> 16:27.903
Well, the Depression caused lots of hardships on 
people. People that had automobiles and trucks

16:29.425 --> 16:35.252
and depended on them for a living, they couldn't 
get any tires. Maybe when they needed them, the

16:35.613 --> 16:41.760
gasoline was rationed, and they couldn't get 
enough gasoline to carry on their business. And

16:42.461 --> 16:43.843
the flour and sugar. And different kinds of food 
were rationed. You had to have ration stamps for

16:46.083 --> 16:49.509
many items, you know. And if you used up your ration 
stamps, you just had to do it out until your next

16:49.529 --> 16:55.078
ones come out. And the gasoline was rationed. And I 
know sugar was rationed. And you could just get so

17:01.008 --> 17:02.851
much sugar a month. That's all you could get. I can 
imagine. Big family, too, especially going

17:05.436 --> 17:08.200
through that. And I'm sure... There was lots of 
hardships during the Depression that I don't

17:10.874 --> 17:15.754
recall because

17:17.202 --> 17:19.245
You know, it's just... I remember my mother 
telling me that there was a lot of people

17:19.265 --> 17:28.360
committing suicide, like the stock markets 
dropping and everything like that, and standing

17:19.265 --> 17:28.360
in the soup line. Yeah, there's lots of people had 
to do that. A lot of people were really hitting it

17:30.162 --> 17:31.404
hard. Yeah, they really had it hard, and lots of 
them were out of work. There was no work for them to

17:34.049 --> 17:35.371
do. That was terrible. It really was a tragic thing 
for our country to have to go through, I'll tell

17:37.835 --> 17:41.961
you, and We were blessed, I guess, in lots of ways. 
Right. Y'all must have gotten hit so hard. All

17:49.597 --> 17:49.977
right. Tell us about your codes for raising your 
family, and how does it differ from today's

17:51.660 --> 17:55.306
standards?

18:02.637 --> 18:05.902
Well, I raised six children, five boys, one girl. 
Times were quite different at first. They went to a

18:10.274 --> 18:16.064
rural school through the 10th grade, then to Bryan 
High to finish. And later, our rural school was

18:17.447 --> 18:22.035
closed, and they all were bused into Bryan. My 
family all had their chores to do each

18:23.818 --> 18:32.974
evening. They were also involved in 4-H projects, 
which kept them busy. I had an understanding with

18:39.800 --> 18:42.084
my children. No matter what came up, I was always 
there to listen and help them with their problems.

18:48.355 --> 18:50.419
I always worked with my children. I found that you 
could lead better than drive. Of course, we didn't

18:53.542 --> 18:56.065
have the problems of today. So many cars, dope, and 
good highways, which make it impossible for them

18:56.506 --> 19:04.436
to get around to so many places.

19:07.800 --> 19:12.526
My family grew up knowing college was 
automatically a part of their schooling. I had

19:13.027 --> 19:15.270
four boys graduate from A&M.

19:18.494 --> 19:22.519
One is a lawyer, one an aeronautical engineer, One 
is state representative, and one works for the

19:23.748 --> 19:31.398
State Department of Agriculture. He graduated 
from Sam Houston State College. My daughter

19:37.146 --> 19:39.789
married an Aggie graduate. How many daughters do 
you have? I just had one. One daughter. And he is

19:44.435 --> 19:48.861
president of the Hygiene Milk Company in 
Harlingen, Texas. Boy, all your sons graduated

19:50.950 --> 19:54.735
from A&M, right? All of them but Danny. Danny 
graduated from Sam Houston. I see. All righty. All

20:01.623 --> 20:03.566
of them went into the service except one. Al, they 
declared a holiday just about a month before he was

20:03.926 --> 20:08.391
to leave. Drafted. I see. All right. What was your 
first job? One of my boys I left out. He's a

20:19.668 --> 20:20.749
veterinary doctor. He must have graduated from 
A&M, right? Yeah, he graduated from A&M, went in

20:25.233 --> 20:31.299
service, stayed seven and a half years, came back 
and went back to A&M and graduated as a veterinary

20:25.233 --> 20:31.299
doctor. That's good. They get good jobs. He has his 
own clinic. That's really good. That was him that

20:40.167 --> 20:41.528
just left. And he's a veterinarian? Mm-hmm. Oh, 
okay. Okay, what was your first job in the

20:46.678 --> 20:50.424
community, and what was it like? Well, the first 
job I had was I was a teacher. I taught up through the

20:55.132 --> 21:03.385
fifth grade in the two-teacher school there at 
Peace Creek where I was raised. Uh-huh. I loved it.

21:05.999 --> 21:06.739
I loved teaching. It was just something that was 
just challenging to you. So I taught the first year

21:10.683 --> 21:13.125
there. Then I went to Tabor, and I taught two years 
out there. And that's where I met my husband and

21:16.709 --> 21:19.171
married. And then I never did get to teach anymore 
because I did not have a degree. And I never did get

21:25.317 --> 21:28.480
to go back to school anymore. But that was my job 
then, and then I also Worked with 4-H for about 25

21:33.483 --> 21:36.206
years. Adult leader. And was camp director for 
several years. Also had held offices in the church

21:42.074 --> 21:46.459
and in the women's society. And I have been a member 
of the local church board, Alexander Methodist

21:47.160 --> 21:54.810
Church, for about 20 years. And where I still go to 
church. I drive from Bryan out there when I go to

21:57.954 --> 22:00.537
church. Oh, that's nice.

22:04.751 --> 22:06.774
And I enjoyed it a lot. So you only really taught 
school for three years? Three years. And what

22:10.498 --> 22:11.520
grade level was this? Do you know? First year, I 
taught through the fifth. Next year, I taught

22:15.906 --> 22:17.488
through the seventh. All the grades in a 
one-teacher school out there close to table. It

22:21.673 --> 22:22.875
wasn't the table school. Then the next year, I 
taught in a table school, which was five teachers,

22:22.895 --> 22:26.980
and I taught... the 5th, 6th, and 7th grades. Did 
you teach all subjects? I mean, were you just,

22:31.307 --> 22:35.272
okay, this is where, okay, you taught arithmetic 
and whatever. Yes, just taught all of them. Oh,

22:37.074 --> 22:37.354
okay. That's the way teachers had to do those days. 
Right, those days. Nowadays it's different.

22:41.299 --> 22:41.859
That's right. We sure are different. Okay. Was 
Brian affected by the energy crisis at all?

22:59.984 --> 23:23.443
yes i'm sure brian was affected quite seriously 
with the energy crisis because we didn't have

22:59.984 --> 23:23.443
enough gas for transportation not enough fuel for 
machinery and to run the different plants that

22:59.984 --> 23:23.443
they run by fuel and we had to consume our 
electricity that is we had to keep the temperature

22:59.984 --> 23:23.443
down turn off the lights and and things of that 
kind. And in the homes and businesses, they had to

23:24.922 --> 23:31.172
keep the temperature real low to conserve the 
electricity and all. And the energy crisis was

23:32.094 --> 23:39.846
just really a serious thing because so many people 
just never thought about what it really meant to be

23:40.805 --> 23:43.548
without it. They just never had been. Never been. 
And they just thought that, oh, well, it's there.

23:48.893 --> 23:49.433
We got it. Right. They just couldn't realize that 
someday that it wouldn't be there. I know. That

23:53.417 --> 23:54.878
would have been a casualty for sure. Yeah. But I 
think it's affected everybody. It has. It sure

24:00.624 --> 24:01.204
has. All right. Has crime increased or decreased 
any? And has it affected you any? Well, I think

24:09.138 --> 24:11.041
crime is on the increase.

24:18.774 --> 24:21.719
Of course, we have more people now than we used to 
have. And we hear a lot more about it. It's

24:24.664 --> 24:25.886
publicized more. And people are able to get around 
more than they used to be. We used to have these

24:30.854 --> 24:35.061
hardtop highways and freeways. and 
farm-to-market roads and things like that, and

24:35.243 --> 24:38.930
they have good cars. Anybody can commit a crime in 
Brown and be in Houston in a couple hours and be out

24:40.172 --> 24:47.526
of the reach of officers. Because back in your day, 
we didn't have that. And in our days, we didn't have

24:49.670 --> 24:51.734
that kind of stuff. We just didn't know anything 
about it. And we have so much dope that's peddled.

24:57.805 --> 25:03.034
and everything till it just makes life more 
miserable, I think. Right. Did y'all have any

25:03.254 --> 25:06.039
horse stealing back in y'all's day? Well, we could 
have had. I don't remember any. Cattle hustling?

25:11.809 --> 25:13.332
Well, I'm sure we had cattle hustling. But I don't 
know. Where we lived, it was more of a community of

25:16.758 --> 25:22.868
people just all worked together. Right. Y'all 
didn't even have to lock your doors at night, did

25:23.551 --> 25:25.133
you? No, we never knew what it was to lock a door. 
Yeah, today you have to. And we ran off from any home

25:27.757 --> 25:29.639
we didn't lock our doors. Right. And if one person 
got into trouble that is needing some work done,

25:30.520 --> 25:38.411
got sick or something, all the community went and 
worked his crop out for him. Well, that's really

25:38.572 --> 25:39.112
great. If he's building a barn, they built a barn 
for him. And people just worked more in harmony

25:41.736 --> 25:45.702
then than they did now. They were more together. 
Yeah, more together. And more involved. That's

25:49.046 --> 25:49.327
right. Most people now don't want to get involved 
with anything. No, you're right there. They sure

25:51.810 --> 25:52.551
were. Well, has crime infected you any? No, the 
extent of just worrying, I think, is the only

25:57.029 --> 26:01.197
thing. You can't help but worry about youngsters. 
And I do have a bunch of young grandsons that are out

26:03.201 --> 26:11.196
at night and times like that and going to school and 
things. And that way, it helps. afraid something

26:13.507 --> 26:27.868
will happen to them, and that's about the only way 
it's affected me, because I keep my doors locked,

26:13.507 --> 26:27.868
and I'm in before night, and I don't get out after 
night unless I'm with some of the boys, or they come

26:13.507 --> 26:27.868
by to pick me up, take me somewhere. Have you had any 
bad casualties with your family? Well, yes, we had

26:33.176 --> 26:37.382
one terrible bad casualty. It is in 1918. At least I 
thought it was bad. It wasn't a fatal casualty, but

26:41.873 --> 26:46.328
my older brother had gone to the army. And he'd come 
home for Christmas holidays. And in the meantime,

26:50.040 --> 26:53.993
after he had left, we had built up a walk and we had 
fixed the brick along the side of it and this walk

26:54.327 --> 27:13.990
went out to this underground cistern and he didn't 
know it was there so the next morning he thought oh I

26:54.327 --> 27:13.990
think I'll just he told my sisters I think I'll just 
wake them all up with a Christmas gun so he took the

26:54.327 --> 27:13.990
shotgun out and raised it up to shoot it and he 
stumbled on one of these bricks and when he did he

27:15.083 --> 27:37.665
fell and naturally he stuck his hand out to catch 
himself and it blew all his hand off and he's lived

27:15.083 --> 27:37.665
with one hand all his life and then another one was 
my nephew my oldest sister's son was fixing to

27:15.083 --> 27:37.665
cross the railroad track here in Bryan and it was a A 
place where you couldn't see the train coming or

27:39.113 --> 27:42.142
anything. There was a lot of blockage there. And 
the garage sat right beside the track. And he

27:45.993 --> 27:47.798
started up on it. And as he did, the train hit him, 
hit the car. And it was weeks. We just didn't know

27:52.051 --> 27:53.595
whether he'd live or not. Oh, that's true. But I 
think prayers were some of the things saved him.

27:56.398 --> 27:57.479
The doctors gave him up. How bad off? I mean, was he 
really... He's fine now. Fine now. I mean, was he in

28:00.802 --> 28:02.824
intensive care when this happened? Well, then 
they didn't have intensive care. Oh, that's

28:04.306 --> 28:04.986
right. But he spent a long time ago there, so he 
married. And he has been teaching in the Air Force

28:08.750 --> 28:15.597
for years and years, ever since he graduated from 
A&M. And he's just doing fine. He's going to retire

28:17.539 --> 28:19.741
and come back here this year. And we'll be happy to 
have him home. Well, that's great.

28:26.635 --> 28:31.044
Let's stop here.

28:32.647 --> 28:33.088
Let's see. What do you think of the fashions today 
and how they affect you? Well, the way they affect

28:37.062 --> 28:49.618
me is that I can't find any dresses because they 
make them all short and so tight that women of our

28:37.062 --> 28:49.618
age just can't find the clothes that are suitable 
for us. And I do think that, of course, they are

28:49.638 --> 28:54.705
getting away from the real, real short ones. 
Shorts that's going down. Like they used to have,

28:55.486 --> 29:02.935
but I think they're kind of tacky the way they're 
getting them down three or four inches below the

28:55.486 --> 29:02.935
knees.
