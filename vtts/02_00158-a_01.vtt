00:03.085 --> 00:15.940
6, 2000, the anniversary of D-Day, at 529

00:03.085 --> 00:15.940
Helena, and getting ready to chat with Mr. Fred 
Nelson. Mr. Nelson, would you say a sentence or

00:16.541 --> 00:18.563
two? Let's check your mic. Well, it's nice to have 
you, and it's one of those things, like I said, I

00:20.245 --> 00:31.098
feel flattered, you know, that you want me to 
recount the days when I was a day in and out. All

00:31.118 --> 00:31.578
right, sir. Nice to see you now.

00:37.763 --> 00:44.632
Mr. Nelson, to begin with, please tell us about 
your growing up. Where were you born? Where did you

00:45.594 --> 00:47.817
go to school? What did your parents do for a living? 
How long had they lived there? Well, we have some in

00:54.366 --> 01:01.896
common that you may not know about or I may have told 
you before, but I grew up in Collin County. My

01:03.278 --> 01:05.020
parents were sharecropping people. And I grew up 
on a farm in a community called Lovejoy. That's

01:11.988 --> 01:16.013
where I went to school until the ninth grade. And in 
those days, high school ended in the 11th grade. So

01:22.322 --> 01:32.897
after finishing at Lovejoy, I then went to Boyd 
High in McKinney, Texas, where I was graduated in

01:22.322 --> 01:32.897
1930. And as you probably will recall, that the 
beginning of the Great Depression was my era. And I

01:43.170 --> 01:52.984
didn't particularly like farm work, so I went into 
the music business, having been talented at

01:43.170 --> 01:52.984
piano. We had little bands in high school. And from 
that situation there, from having become a

01:57.470 --> 02:06.242
musician, so to speak, I went on, and during the 
Depression, I made whatever living I could from

02:06.323 --> 02:14.835
playing around with different bands. So from 
there, out of McKinney, I left somewhere probably

02:16.658 --> 02:32.601
in the mid-30s and started out on the road with 
various musical organizations from somewhere

02:16.658 --> 02:32.601
maybe in the the area of the south to the east coast, 
and halfway to the west coast from time to time with

02:34.640 --> 02:45.695
the various types of bands.

02:48.358 --> 02:51.362
What were the names of some of the bands you played 
with? Well, one I can think of right offhand, we had

02:52.083 --> 03:02.217
our own bands, you know, and we organized, but we 
never did really have a name. until I'd say in the

03:02.635 --> 03:09.328
mid-30s, I went with a band out of Waco called the 
Joe Buzzy Band. B-U-Z-Z-E, Buzzy. And we toured

03:14.278 --> 03:19.649
Texas on one-night stands, et cetera, et cetera. 
And until about 1939, I got tired of that one night

03:25.028 --> 03:29.133
stand thing and traveling over the state of Texas. 
And so I left the organization and went to Fort

03:29.754 --> 03:35.641
Worth where my sister and her husband lived. And 
eventually I went into,

03:37.363 --> 03:49.197
let's see, I've forgotten what the name, as I think 
of it, general merchandising thing, you know.

03:52.949 --> 03:53.950
Let's see what was the name. I couldn't remember 
what the name was. You could probably remember the

03:56.292 --> 03:58.114
name. There was a big organization there in Fort 
Worth, and I worked. Leonard, was it Leonard

04:03.320 --> 04:04.961
Brothers? It was Dawes Crossford Street from 
Leonard's. You remember what? No, sir. I'll

04:09.566 --> 04:10.107
remember it. Anyway, I went into the clothing 
business, and so in 1940, I had a call from one of the

04:20.395 --> 04:31.913
musicians that I played in a band with around 
McKinney, and he wanted to know if I'd be

04:20.395 --> 04:31.913
interested in coming to A&M and playing piano in 
the Aggieland Orchestra. Well, having always

04:33.235 --> 04:40.446
wanted to go to A&M, I guess you could say I might 
have jumped at the chance. And as an aside, I also

04:41.506 --> 04:53.117
had a chance at the same time to go with, at the 
behest of another musician I worked with before,

04:41.506 --> 04:53.117
to go to Texas Tech. So I was considering going to 
Texas Tech and playing a band out there, or come to

04:54.058 --> 05:00.644
A&M. So like I say, having always aspired to be an 
Aggie, I chose to come to A&M, and I came here in

05:01.705 --> 05:09.572
1940. Let me back up a little bit about your 
parents.

05:16.595 --> 05:19.163
Do you have any idea how many acres they farmed? 
Yes, I think we had 140 some odd acres. And we farmed

05:22.715 --> 05:26.120
cotton, corn, oats. You know, and sometimes we 
tried wheat, but wheat didn't grow well in that

05:26.581 --> 05:30.827
part of the country. Which of those was the most 
profitable? Cotton? Cotton, probably so, yes.

05:37.437 --> 05:38.378
Where did y'all gin it? In McKinney.

05:42.244 --> 05:46.069
And was McKinney where you went to spend money, to 
shop? Yes, uh-huh. McKinney, we were southeast of

05:47.825 --> 05:53.872
McKinney about seven miles in a community called 
Lovejoy. Also a little Baptist church called

05:53.892 --> 05:59.579
Friendship where I was converted. And then there 
was a funeral situation, a cemetery at Forest

06:00.440 --> 06:05.886
Grove. And then between the two churches, Lovejoy 
was on the farm road out there. Now what were your

06:13.556 --> 06:15.638
duties on that farm? Well, I picked cotton, 
gathered corn, and the usual things. But I had two

06:22.535 --> 06:28.883
older brothers who did the plowing and managing 
the livestock and that type of thing. And you all

06:29.544 --> 06:32.167
plowed with mules, or did you have a tractor? With 
mules. Tractors were a novel thing in those days.

06:37.814 --> 06:41.519
And let's see, electricity, telephone? Well, we 
had a community telephone. but no electricity,

06:44.879 --> 06:55.389
you know, lamps, coal oil lamps, and eventually 
you got one of those gas things, you know, the air

06:44.879 --> 06:55.389
type thing. And where was your well, your water? We 
had two wells, one for the stock at the farm on the,

07:00.553 --> 07:14.346
you know, out around the barn area, and one near the 
house, both of which finally went beyond the

07:00.553 --> 07:14.346
depth, you know, water dropped off, you know. And 
so we started having to haul water in. And we, there

07:21.506 --> 07:27.674
was a creek near our place, near the community. Was 
that Spring Creek or East Fork of the, or Rowlett

07:27.934 --> 07:32.921
Creek? I believe it was probably East Fork. And 
let's see. There's a After our water level dropped

07:44.043 --> 07:58.659
below the level of our wells, there was a place down 
on this what they call Wilson Creek. It had a well on

07:59.860 --> 08:00.941
it. The water was practically to the top of the 
ground. The water level there was so, I guess it was

08:04.865 --> 08:10.371
feeding off that creek. So we used to haul, my dad 
had a, a big tank made and put it on the wagon and we'd

08:13.625 --> 08:21.916
go down there and draw water and haul it home and 
that's what we used. That's how we kept water at the

08:22.417 --> 08:25.061
house. And how did you get to school when you went 
into McKinney? My dad had a car and I had two sisters

08:31.550 --> 08:40.662
who were students at the time and one of my sisters

08:43.426 --> 08:51.273
McKinney and they had, I don't know what it was,

08:43.426 --> 08:51.273
to go to school. Oh, so you would go to town and spend 
the night in town? No, we'd drive, oh, I would drive

08:57.479 --> 09:09.771
the car, you know, and there was two or three guys

08:57.479 --> 09:09.771
from Lovejoy there that went to McKinney and 
really formed that, yeah. Where

09:10.696 --> 09:29.833
did you learn to play the piano? Well, I started 
sitting around... But

09:32.245 --> 09:48.764
the piano, when I was

09:32.245 --> 09:48.764
about

09:32.245 --> 09:48.764
six or seven years old, I guess I had a natural 
talent. And I just progressed from there. From

09:49.524 --> 09:51.767
every year, I seemed to maybe improve a little bit 
or learn a little bit of something. And I might say,

09:51.787 --> 09:57.213
I have often said that I started playing the piano 
when I was six. And I learned by myself. Although I

09:59.355 --> 10:01.678
had older sisters. So

10:02.047 --> 10:23.311
you didn't have any formal piano instruction? You 
didn't? You never had a teacher outside the

10:24.593 --> 10:27.696
family? Well, When

10:28.979 --> 10:50.916
I was about

10:28.979 --> 10:50.916
in, I guess, maybe the fourth or fifth grade, I had a 
teacher who taught me for about three months. But

10:50.936 --> 10:53.801
when the end of the school year, and when she came 
out of my camp, you know, and goes out there to

10:50.936 --> 10:53.801
teach. But when the school term ended, when I was 
having my lessons with her, Did you

10:56.080 --> 11:07.761
have a model? Who were you trying to play the piano 
like? No, I

11:11.572 --> 11:24.706
didn't have a, see, we didn't have a radio in that 
place. And I used to,

11:24.726 --> 11:33.055
did you ever hear a singing school? Well, we had a 
singing school. And every year, this band was also

11:34.176 --> 11:36.299
a community member, had a special community out of 
a songbook. So I used to make those things. I guess I

11:36.959 --> 11:38.541
might have been the one or two, if we haven't known 
over a few years. And I may have learned some things

11:38.892 --> 11:42.838
from doing that. So were you playing gospel music 
first? Yes. Church music? Yes. But we didn't have a

11:48.686 --> 11:56.077
radio, you know, so we didn't get the benefit of the 
programs that were sent out over the radio. And

11:56.097 --> 12:02.186
mainly I began to play songs in the songbook. And 
I've never learned to read music. Did

12:06.989 --> 12:17.683
you

12:06.989 --> 12:17.683
ever use any of the Stamps Quartet music? Oh, yes. 
There was another piano man in the community who

12:20.787 --> 12:30.239
specialized in the Stamps Quartet music. And I 
never tried to compete with him because I was more

12:30.259 --> 12:35.005
inclined to the popper music. level of music than 
otherwise. So when you finished high school, you

12:38.161 --> 12:43.767
worked a little, and then you went on the road. And 
about what year did you first go on the road? Let's

12:48.192 --> 12:48.933
see. I was 30. I was 18. And I have to kind of recount 
how far back I went on the road. I believe that my

12:59.846 --> 13:05.312
first introduction to the popular music that I 
learned was when Two friends of mine, one a country

13:05.917 --> 13:17.111
man and the other a intersex man, we used to get 
together and play. And I had little small bands and

13:17.131 --> 13:24.721
we appeared in a little dance hall, you know, there 
in McKinney for a while. Well, these two guys

13:24.741 --> 13:27.765
belonged to the National Choir. And one summer, at 
the county picnic, One of them, the trumpet man,

13:34.013 --> 13:42.693
approached me and said, how would you like to go to 
the National Guard training camp as a musician? So

13:42.713 --> 13:46.541
my parents didn't want me to go. I was 16 at the time. 
No, was I 16?

13:51.057 --> 13:55.361
Yeah, I guess I was still in high school the first 
time I went to National Guard. I was about 16, and I

13:55.381 --> 14:00.026
went down there and played with the 16th police 
officers. I couldn't read a note. I just had to go by

14:02.008 --> 14:07.254
ear, you know, to find out what came next, so to 
speak. And that was really my first introduction

14:08.175 --> 14:10.797
to the big band.

14:14.581 --> 14:18.465
And that National Guard thing only lasted two 
weeks. I didn't join the National Guard. I was

14:20.513 --> 14:27.405
going as a substitute for a man, a member of the band 
in the National Guard who could not go. So they put

14:28.146 --> 14:31.772
me into his team and so forth. Did y'all, was your 
primary task to play for National Guard dances?

14:37.402 --> 14:38.464
Yes, uh-huh. So y'all were not playing march 
music? No, we weren't. Dance music? Yeah. Of

14:43.454 --> 14:55.185
course, they had a band, you know, and these 
people, the rest of the people were members of the

14:43.454 --> 14:55.185
band, and this was kind of an offshoot of the band, 
you know, various ones. Of course, they didn't

14:55.205 --> 15:01.171
have a piano band, and they substituted me in 
there. I don't know how it was expanded, but

15:01.191 --> 15:07.276
anyway, I learned a lot from going back. I went to 
three different years of camp in the National

15:07.296 --> 15:12.381
Guard. ever worry about a young Baptist boy 
playing dance music? I've never heard of it.

15:19.905 --> 15:22.209
Nobody ever? When you went on the road with those 
bands, do you remember some of the towns you all

15:22.890 --> 15:32.023
went to? Uh, with Buzz's band, we'd go out into West 
Texas, and, you know, they held rodeos. Sometimes

15:39.119 --> 15:40.520
they had a three-day rodeo. So we'd book in for 
three nights of dance. And, uh, I don't know. It was

15:46.569 --> 15:47.250
very familiar. West Texas dance. There's not 
anything out now that I can pull up, you know. About

15:52.978 --> 15:54.520
how many were in his band? There was nine of us, I 
believe, in that band, in Buzz's band. And, uh...

16:00.235 --> 16:01.196
What did they play? What instruments? We probably 
had three saxes, two or three trumpets, two

16:02.939 --> 16:12.673
trombones, bass, piano, and drummer. And what 
kind of music did you all play? We played, I guess,

16:16.038 --> 16:24.330
the big band stuff. Do you remember how much pay you 
got? Yeah, it was very little, about $5 an hour,

16:29.075 --> 16:32.840
something like that. But that was pretty good pay, 
though, for that era. Yeah. How did y'all travel?

16:38.146 --> 16:41.069
The band leader owned the bus, and he drove it. 
Although, finally, the bass man, yeah, the bass

16:41.910 --> 16:49.259
man finally did the driving, you know, and they 
swapped off. And one night, the bass man went down

16:50.380 --> 16:54.886
in South Africa. We didn't play in a place. And we'd 
move over to the next town where we'd go and check in

16:56.969 --> 17:02.440
the motel about daylight. And then we'd stay there 
all day, and then we'd see it at night. So it kind of

17:07.510 --> 17:10.776
helped us out. So our extension was used up. But the 
base man, he was down about two or three o'clock in

17:13.575 --> 17:25.707
the morning. And he had some kind of stomach 
problem. It required emergency treatment. And

17:29.110 --> 17:31.873
they went to the hospital. So we put him in the 
hospital. And I think he had to be in there several

17:32.754 --> 17:34.836
days. But anyway, that's just one of the little 
things that you put up with when you're out on the

17:34.856 --> 17:39.480
road. Did y'all go out of state, or did you stay in 
Texas? We stayed in Texas with that band. I had gone

17:47.564 --> 17:53.854
to Durango, Colorado

17:47.564 --> 17:53.854
with that band. A member of it, in that band, wanted 
me to come to Texas. We stayed in Durango for about a

18:00.463 --> 18:06.312
year, and then we came back to Texas.

18:11.202 --> 18:37.250
What year

18:11.202 --> 18:37.250
was it

18:11.202 --> 18:37.250
that the man from A&M contacted you? 1940? So you 
were how old then? I was born in 1912. Well, so you

18:45.055 --> 18:47.219
were 28. And what was his name? Well, Murray Evans 
was the guy who got me down there. I can't remember

18:55.291 --> 18:59.798
the band leader's name. Excuse me. All these 
things, of course, if you need to have that

19:00.039 --> 19:03.824
information, you can get it in the yearbook. Yes. 
How did you get to College Station? What did you

19:08.982 --> 19:09.843
bring with you? Do you remember what it was? Well, I 
came dressed in a suit. And as a matter of fact,

19:16.532 --> 19:30.250
after about a day down here with Evan, he said to me, 
you

19:16.532 --> 19:30.250
know, Fred, I don't think you ought to come to New 
York. I said, why not? Well, I didn't ask him that

19:30.931 --> 19:35.057
right now, but I said, no, I've always wanted to go 
to Indiana, and I'm going to stay. He said, if you

19:35.077 --> 19:35.918
want to. So later on, he did tell me, he said, well, 
you were dressed like you, you know, you'd given up

19:36.505 --> 19:48.583
a good job, but probably hadn't the best clothes 
on, you know. And all the guys in the band treated me

19:48.783 --> 19:55.813
like I was, you know, maybe a junior or something. 
Do

19:55.979 --> 20:21.046
you remember

19:55.979 --> 20:21.046
what your major was that freshman year? Well, I 
started off with it. And

20:25.257 --> 20:49.951
where did you, what dorm were you in? Here's what 
happened. The guys, they would bring me down here,

20:51.934 --> 20:54.437
you know. What

20:55.075 --> 21:23.580
was the name? B-A-U-S-H-A-B-S-E-N.

21:24.623 --> 21:29.251
Where was it? It was up on College Avenue over there 
in that building. You may remember where they had

21:35.000 --> 21:41.992
the hat shop over there. That used to be a student's 
house. At that time, they didn't have enough

21:46.459 --> 21:49.264
housing on the campus. And

21:49.852 --> 22:10.733
you

21:49.852 --> 22:10.733
know, the man that started that, the housing thing 
out there, you know, they had about 14 of those

21:49.852 --> 22:10.733
houses down in New Mexico. At the time when I came to 
A&M, A&M was growing, and students were staying as

22:10.753 --> 22:14.197
far away as they could in Caldwell and places like 
that to be able to find a house to stay in. And they

22:14.217 --> 22:14.577
commuted. And we commuted, but this one guy owned a 
truck, a big bed on the back of it, and we used to ride

22:15.316 --> 22:23.847
it, too, in that time. Now, as a freshman, you were 
in the Corps of Cadets. No, I didn't get in because I

22:27.471 --> 22:33.459
was old enough to decide not to. And besides, then 
we had the Franks, you know, in the uniform. I came

22:36.262 --> 22:39.366
down here, and I was 30 bucks in my pocket. And it was 
all that wrecked the situation. If I had to depend

22:42.097 --> 22:59.040
on my finances to keep a place to sleep, I could keep 
it in the street. Having no one, you know. But the

22:59.561 --> 23:03.746
books land, you know, in the chorus. There's 
chorus out there for the chorus dancers, you know,

23:03.766 --> 23:06.109
that . And then we play for the chorus dancers. So 
we'd be playing maybe every Friday night. Where

23:12.858 --> 23:14.240
were those dances held? In Sabisa. In Sabisa. And 
so you were the pianist?

23:21.769 --> 23:21.989
Yes, I was. Please try to recall as much as you can 
the names of the people in the band when you joined

23:22.009 --> 23:29.819
it. Well, you know, that's a long time ago. I 
realize I can only remember... Maybe one man's

23:35.742 --> 23:37.564
name. Who was it? That was the guy that got me down. 
Oh, because he was from my hometown. I'd known him

23:41.969 --> 23:45.332
for a long time. But in a 16 guy, you know, you don't 
really know anybody's name very well. And did a

23:51.058 --> 23:56.063
number of them live at the same place you did? No. 
Actually, most of them were corpsmen. Okay. And,

24:01.229 --> 24:05.293
you know, they played in the bands out there, you 
know. Do

24:05.678 --> 24:17.282
you remember how much did y'all get paid? I worked 
in the English office one time for 25 cents an hour.

24:28.088 --> 24:39.544
And you can see that if I got $5 a dance,

24:28.088 --> 24:39.544
you know, those dances, well, I was, like you said, 
you know, sometimes $5 or $500. Did you have to pay

24:39.564 --> 24:41.968
rent at that boarding house? No,

24:43.069 --> 24:52.082
I didn't. No. I had to pay for food. But it was more or 
less a kind of a reason. It was kind of a favorite

24:54.726 --> 24:56.408
deal of ours. They had had two piano men before me, 
maybe more, I know more than that. They were

25:05.168 --> 25:07.171
brothers. And one played during history, and then 
the other kept away. And then they didn't have

25:08.733 --> 25:11.957
anybody else, so that's when they got me. And they 
were very, that's tenuous, because piano men are

25:11.977 --> 25:18.025
hard to come by. Now, how did you move the piano 
around? Well, we played it. And so there was a piano

25:27.113 --> 25:28.535
there. Now, when did you go over there to practice? 
How often? I think we rehearsed Monday. I can't

25:38.887 --> 25:40.789
remember whether it was Thursday or Tuesday 
night. Glenn

25:41.495 --> 26:11.502
Miller, Benny Goodman.

26:11.752 --> 26:17.239
Y'all were most similar to which one of them? 
Probably more like Ben Miller. We played most of

26:19.082 --> 26:21.925
his songs. And then Benny Goodman and the two 
brothers, Tommy Dorothy and his brother Jimmy,

26:21.945 --> 26:33.741
all of

26:21.945 --> 26:33.741
them played about the same kind of music. So we kind 
of played that kind of thing. And I can tell you

26:34.582 --> 26:35.363
about this. There

26:36.440 --> 26:48.554
used to be something called a six-band night. And 
they'd go out and see who was most wanted right

26:49.875 --> 26:54.320
there. So we got the four students that they knew. 
They had a show once a week called the six-band

26:58.245 --> 27:00.467
night. And they picked up bands from around the 
world. It seemed to be the top of the class. Do you

27:05.633 --> 27:27.743
remember

27:05.633 --> 27:27.743
what year that was? It's probably 41. And where in 
Dallas did y'all play? Was it one of the big hotels?

27:33.971 --> 27:35.573
Yes, I think it was in Dallas. That's 
A-D-O-L-P-H-U-S. Adolphus. But most of us always

27:41.768 --> 27:45.133
say Dolphus.

27:46.755 --> 27:58.212
What

27:46.755 --> 27:58.212
did you all wear when you were playing? Suit. But 
was it a coat and tie? Yeah. We didn't have a uniform

28:04.861 --> 28:06.083
on. did did and you always call the group the aggie 
land orchestra yeah and

28:06.569 --> 28:32.357
about would you do one average one a concert a week 
or twice? No, usually it's one a week because, you

28:35.950 --> 28:47.670
know, the chorus, the chorus, people would have 
their own dances planned. And they'd have their

28:47.690 --> 28:49.573
girlfriends come down. At that time, we had a 
railroad theater. And about 6 o'clock in the

28:52.477 --> 28:59.509
afternoon on Friday, they'd go down to the railway 
station and meet their girls and sing. And

28:59.810 --> 29:04.476
generally, I would say they had already booked 
them.

29:07.399 --> 29:12.586
How did Aggies and their dates behave at those 
bands at those dances? Well, you know, that was

29:13.086 --> 29:19.574
when we had those wild dances, you know, and most 
everybody did. Jitterbug. Yeah. But though Did

29:22.405 --> 29:24.188
they ever get out of line? Did the Aggies 
misbehave? No, not ever. We didn't have any

29:28.096 --> 29:34.748
trouble at all. And the young ladies, what did they 
wear to the dances?

29:43.027 --> 30:07.212
as i guess you expect them to you know coming this 
far you know just because it's a special occasion

29:43.027 --> 30:07.212
in their lives they came down from the girls 
college in tscw yeah cia at first yeah that's right

29:43.027 --> 30:07.212
yeah yeah well they'd come down you know i guess 
they'd get together up there and they Now

30:07.833 --> 30:23.533
when y'all, when the Aggieland Orchestra went 
somewhere out of town, how did y'all get there?

30:27.018 --> 30:35.629
During the Christmas season, our band leader 
would book dances all over the hometown And we used

30:36.503 --> 30:44.693
to play every night somewhere. We'd start out in 
San Angelo and go out to Lagos and that big spring

30:44.773 --> 31:03.996
and Odessa and all these towns in between and we'd 
just kind of make a circle.

31:05.393 --> 31:11.273
If it was too far, we'd have some other kind of 
arrangement. The mother's club had arranged to

31:11.293 --> 31:18.137
bed the guys, you know, in various homes.
