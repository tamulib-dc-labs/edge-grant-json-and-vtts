WEBVTT

00:01.837 --> 00:11.432
Our organization escorted the paratroopers in 
and the gliders. Was this the evening before

00:11.452 --> 00:14.717
D-Day? No, it wasn't. Or was it at the same time? 
Same time, on D-Day. On D-Day, when the gliders

00:18.102 --> 00:24.031
went in, we were escorting the ships towing the 
gliders. The paratroopers went in. I think land

00:29.039 --> 00:33.745
first, and then the gliders came in. And did you 
help plan where they were going to land? Yeah.

00:36.850 --> 00:38.051
Well, not where they were going to land. No, I was 
only planning our escort, giving them, planning

00:38.111 --> 00:42.818
the times. We flew by squadrons, and we had 
squadrons taking off at that time to rendezvous

00:43.699 --> 00:54.574
with one of the, each one of the trains of gliders.

00:57.828 --> 01:01.513
Were you upset that you weren't going to be in? I was 
very upset that I wasn't participating, but they

01:01.533 --> 01:10.384
said that everybody that knew what the plans were, 
none of us could fly on that day. I did fly the next

01:10.704 --> 01:13.748
day. Now when you flew the next day, what was your 
mission? We were supporting the troops on the

01:16.992 --> 01:23.380
ground.

01:24.035 --> 01:32.923
We were given either targets or we were ported in to 
the ground controller that he directed us. And

01:32.943 --> 01:44.854
that's

01:32.943 --> 01:44.854
what we did the rest

01:32.943 --> 01:44.854
of the work. And we covered that until the 
breakthrough. And we covered Patton all the way

01:48.697 --> 01:50.559
across. So you worked directly with Third Army? 
Yeah. We had to fill our wing tanks with maps and

01:54.292 --> 02:14.072
take them up there and drop

01:54.292 --> 02:14.072
them. If Patton would liberate one of the German 
Army's warehouses, he'd send us a truckload of

02:15.605 --> 02:26.098
booze of some type. He'd send us Cointreau. We'd 
have free Cointreau at the bar. Later on, we

02:34.448 --> 02:37.591
liberated the champagne caves. We had free 
champagne at the bar. I think we sold a nickel a

02:41.076 --> 02:44.700
bottle or something like that. And if he got in 
Germany, he'd be with the snobs.

02:56.491 --> 03:06.627
He was very, very well

02:56.491 --> 03:06.627
thought of

02:56.491 --> 03:06.627
by us in what he was doing. And he didn't forget who 
was helping him either. I was wondering about when

03:11.107 --> 03:23.463
you flew across the channel on the day after D-Day, 
D-plus-1, you must have seen, what were your

03:11.107 --> 03:23.463
impressions when you saw it? Oh, it was exciting. 
And all of the ships were out there in the harbor. It

03:30.712 --> 03:33.836
was just exciting. It really made you feel a lot of 
pride in what we were doing. wanted to get on with.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.734
We were really excited. And we were one of the first 
units to get transferred over into. That was going

03:50.760 --> 03:52.442
to be my next question. Where were you transferred 
in France? We went to Pont Tarzan, which is right at

03:55.205 --> 04:10.122
the base of the Brittany Peninsula,

03:55.205 --> 04:10.122
right down the road from Mont Saint-Michel. a

04:10.642 --> 04:22.817
very famous tourist

04:10.642 --> 04:22.817
place there based in Britain. How were the 
conditions? Well, we had a pure steel plant runway

04:24.599 --> 04:35.952
that the engineers

04:24.599 --> 04:35.952
had built. We had an old chateau where there group 
headquarters was. We had

04:44.350 --> 04:58.791
some barracks for the men that the Germans

04:44.350 --> 04:58.791
had been using. We had our men sleep there. It was so 
much better accommodations than we had in England

04:59.372 --> 05:04.600
where we were living in tents. We thought it was 
good. How'd the French people treat you? Were they

05:08.717 --> 05:09.778
happy to see you? Oh, I'll say. They were really 
number one. Boy, they couldn't do enough for us.

05:18.306 --> 05:19.987
They were really excited. They told stories of how 
the Germans had been bailing out of this barracks

05:20.027 --> 05:26.914
that they had, jumping out of the second story.

05:32.278 --> 05:36.302
They were

05:32.278 --> 05:36.302
very emotional. Extremely. They couldn't, they 
just couldn't do enough for us. What did they do for

05:43.416 --> 05:44.457
you? I mean, did they give you food or wine or 
anything? Oh,

05:46.620 --> 05:56.532
they, they gave us, you know, they'd give you food 
and wine if you wanted. If we had food, we went to the

05:56.552 --> 06:05.023
Moe Sammy Shell and we'd have a 12 course dinner 
with wine.

06:08.007 --> 06:18.544
Sometimes we had to furnish part of the food, 
though, like

06:08.007 --> 06:18.544
meat or something like that. We had everything 
there. We had chicken, eggs. I remember Madame

06:23.433 --> 06:28.361
Foulard, a very famous eating establishment. 
Madame Foulard and Tom, they were all famous. We

06:32.588 --> 06:33.930
thought we were doing pretty high time. And how 
often did you fly a mission whenever the Army

06:35.986 --> 06:40.774
needed your assistance? Yes, we had Frag orders 
that came in. It was fairly often.

06:50.329 --> 06:58.883
Were you involved after the breakout, were you 
involved in supporting the liberation of Paris?

07:00.926 --> 07:01.627
Or were you moving? Yes. We were indirectly 
involved because we were bombing, and we

07:03.610 --> 07:10.620
leapfrogged up and back near there. And it so 
happens that one of our men, who was the best man at

07:10.860 --> 07:30.106
my wedding, by the way, a close friend of mine, was 
shot down on one of these ground support missions.

07:30.126 --> 07:33.010
And he was in Paris after the As they were 
liberating Paris, a general had left and left his

07:34.188 --> 07:47.125
colonel in charge, and the colonel surrendered to 
my captain, Pete Carson. Surrendered the city to

07:47.145 --> 07:49.468
him. And he said that was really exciting.

07:54.995 --> 07:59.521
It really whined at that. He finally made his way 
back to where we were. I

08:03.753 --> 08:18.283
noticed that in October of 1944, just a few months 
after the invasion, you became the commander of

08:03.753 --> 08:18.283
the 365th Fighter Squadron. Yes. Were you 
promoted at that time?

08:33.183 --> 08:39.752
Well, I went over as a first lieutenant, and I was 
later promoted to captain. I was an operations

08:39.772 --> 08:45.380
officer for a flight commander, and then I was an 
operations officer. Then I was made squadron

08:45.400 --> 08:47.743
commander. I was promoted to major. Yeah, you were 
promoted November 1, 1944 to major. And I was made

08:53.431 --> 08:58.718
squadron commander of another squadron.

09:06.528 --> 09:10.852
We had gotten a new group commander by that time.

09:15.217 --> 09:21.023
He really influenced me a lot. Well, we had a, who 
was it? James B. Tipton. He retired late at night.

09:29.151 --> 09:32.755
We had a guy in charge, Cecil Wells, a group 
commander. During the time we trained, when we

09:34.625 --> 09:39.694
went over, and he got shot down. But he was too 
conservative in our community. He was what we

09:45.284 --> 09:48.269
called a grandma. A grandma? Yeah. He was always 
afraid that we were going to do something, taking

09:50.292 --> 09:59.248
these boys over, and he wanted to bring every damn 
one of them back. He just was too conservative and

09:59.515 --> 10:02.719
wouldn't let us be aggressive. And we got this guy 
Tipton in. He showed me how to turn an organization

10:05.202 --> 10:12.130
around, how to raise morale, how to get a spree to 
court. We painted the tails of our airplanes

10:13.011 --> 10:15.914
orange. And we got word later on that the Germans 
knew when they saw the orange tails, they all ran

10:16.074 --> 10:25.185
for cover because they knew we were going to get to 
hell. beat on it. And we compiled a in the Oval

10:26.505 --> 10:33.957
Record after this guy joined us. We just turned the 
whole organization. Was he a general? No, he was a

10:38.304 --> 10:39.787
colonel. But he was your colonel and you were the 
major under him. Yeah. Was morale low under this

10:47.399 --> 10:50.604
earlier man? He wasn't low.

10:55.574 --> 10:59.297
We were frustrated, more frustrated, because he 
didn't let us go.

11:02.280 --> 11:06.624
He was too protective.

11:11.028 --> 11:22.138
This guy just turned the whole organization 
around, and we got three presidential citations.

11:22.158 --> 11:24.400
Did cash OPs also increase? We had plenty of 
casualties anyway. It was no great deal.

11:32.953 --> 11:54.640
Well, we were fortunate,

11:32.953 --> 11:54.640
too, but when the Germans

11:32.953 --> 11:54.640
had passed on We had the

11:55.210 --> 12:10.026
lousy weather and it was gruesome the first day we 
did take off. Unfortunately, three squadrons of

12:10.046 --> 12:22.720
us got up there and one squadron just ran into all 
kinds of enemy aircraft and shot a bunch of them

12:10.046 --> 12:22.720
down and our squadron didn't even see one. But we 
got up there, and

12:25.535 --> 12:38.949
we

12:25.535 --> 12:38.949
got comments back later about how appreciative 
they were when we got up there. And we did, even

12:39.249 --> 12:42.213
though the weather was loud. We couldn't really 
see the ground, but

12:42.233 --> 12:47.258
we were overhead. And later on, after the weather 
cleared up, we did the job on five minutes

12:47.718 --> 12:53.044
straight. And did you knock out the major target 
was probably the German tanks? Yes, tanks. We had

13:02.255 --> 13:06.241
rockets for tanks. Did you knock some of those out 
just now?

13:11.368 --> 13:11.549
Oh, yeah. We disabled them at least. We knocked 
them out

13:14.253 --> 13:20.422
completely. What were your feelings when you did 
disable a tank? It was a feeling of relation,

13:24.800 --> 13:32.692
and you couldn't wait to get back to talk about it. 
That's sort of doing your job. Well, that was sort

13:35.356 --> 13:46.032
of characteristic of

13:35.356 --> 13:46.032
fighter pilots, to get up early and get briefed and 
get off and get off on the mission. And at that time,

13:47.581 --> 13:51.086
we would turn them around, maybe three missions a 
day. No kidding. During the, as it cleared up, as

13:51.646 --> 13:58.095
far as the Battle of the Bulge, the airplanes would 
go up for three missions a day. The fighters, what,

13:58.135 --> 14:01.219
one mission a day, or the fighters? Sometimes the 
pilots would go up for more than once. Sometimes

14:04.664 --> 14:06.125
two missions a day. Of

14:06.146 --> 14:11.833
course, the...

14:17.213 --> 14:24.326
A lot depended on the weather and what was going on 
and what the ground forces needed. And did you feel

14:25.047 --> 14:27.271
threatened by the Battle of the Bulge? We all felt 
threatened by the Battle of the Bulge, yes. But we

14:32.300 --> 14:39.593
didn't think it was going

14:32.300 --> 14:39.593
to—we didn't think that they would be able to stop 
us.

14:43.606 --> 14:45.028
That would only be temporary. Yeah, which it was. 
Sure. Absolutely. Now, when you became the

14:50.256 --> 14:55.964
commander of the fighter squadron, how many 
planes did you have under your control? We had 25.

15:00.651 --> 15:02.113
You personally had 25? Yeah. And how many pilots?

15:06.740 --> 15:07.802
We had about 30 pilots. How many maintenance 
personnel?

15:14.926 --> 15:16.107
About a hundred. About a hundred? What were your 
feelings when you received, this is your first

15:17.649 --> 15:24.035
command, is that not right? Well, the first 
overall command, yes. And what were your

15:30.422 --> 15:32.023
feelings? I was proud, very proud,

15:32.043 --> 15:43.735
and very eager

15:32.043 --> 15:43.735
to do the best I could. take care of my men and

15:44.086 --> 15:48.873
get them in the air. Were there major challenges? 
Or was this pretty much carrying on? What were your

15:53.960 --> 15:55.462
predecessors left off? Or did you have to make some 
changes? We had to make some changes because we

15:57.906 --> 16:03.814
were in a moving situation. We had to improvise and 
we scrounged stuff and built ourselves a

16:13.212 --> 16:42.190
operations building and then

16:13.212 --> 16:42.190
moved in boarded up all our tents so the man had a 
better place

16:13.212 --> 16:42.190
to live it was really a scrounging job to get things 
for

16:13.212 --> 16:42.190
your people and did you like the role of leadership 
I

16:42.845 --> 17:09.729
guess

16:42.845 --> 17:09.729
I enjoyed

16:42.845 --> 17:09.729
it very much. I looked at it as a challenge to see if I 
could inspire my people to do better and instill in

17:09.749 --> 17:12.531
them a spirit cooperation,

17:12.798 --> 17:20.291
esprit de corps, want to get the job done. Do you 
think you accomplished that? I think I did. I think

17:23.536 --> 17:25.399
we had as good a squadron as we rode over. What type 
of airplanes did you have? 47. You still had the 47,

17:29.186 --> 17:31.890
so the whole time.

17:35.015 --> 17:37.219
What was your opinion on the 47? We loved the P-47. 
It was a great airplane. You can't imagine the

17:42.182 --> 17:45.067
things that we went through when we came back. One 
boy had a cylinder shot off the top of it, lost all

17:45.087 --> 17:49.656
his oil, and threw all of it back. That's 
durability. And one of my airplanes, the one that I

17:53.503 --> 17:59.674
had my name on, everybody had his own airplane. He 
didn't get to fly it. unless it was ready when he

18:01.297 --> 18:06.201
came up with the schedule for his mission. If it was 
ready, well, he took it. One of my friends from

18:09.444 --> 18:29.683
Texas, Bryce Littlejohn from Marshall, had my 
airplane one day and an FW-190 or a Focke-Wulf 190

18:09.444 --> 18:29.683
or an ME-109 or one of the others got on his tail and 
put 108 bullet holes This airplane was mine. But he

18:33.075 --> 18:33.896
got it back. No kidding, didn't he? He got a piece of 
equipment. Yeah. It was a real workhorse. It was a

18:41.143 --> 18:45.467
real sturdy, sturdily built airplane. It could 
take a punch. It had an armored seat. Eight machine

18:50.852 --> 18:52.014
guns. It could carry three 1,000-pound bombs.

18:58.655 --> 19:11.837
I was also wondering, when you became the 
commander, did this mean that you still got to go

18:58.655 --> 19:11.837
out on the missions, or did this reduce the number 
of missions you went on and increase the amount of

18:58.655 --> 19:11.837
administrative work? It increased the amount of 
administrative work tremendously, but I still

19:11.857 --> 19:18.808
tried to fly regularly.

19:21.813 --> 19:24.898
Probably not every day, but every other day or so.

19:29.468 --> 19:33.252
I had 122 missions, I think. You didn't have

19:33.272 --> 19:43.624
122 missions? Were there any differences when you 
moved from fighting in France to Germany?

20:00.772 --> 20:09.024
Well, when we moved into Germany, we moved into an 
old Luftwaffe base, and we had fine quarters for

20:00.772 --> 20:09.024
our men. Where'd you move? You moved from this 
French base up in Brittany to, your next move then

20:11.026 --> 20:23.704
was into German, into the Luftwaffe base?

20:23.724 --> 20:30.694
We moved, we spent the winter at this one near 
Nancy, and then our next move was into Germany.

20:32.125 --> 20:59.570
Where?

20:59.590 --> 21:00.851
My memory's bad. Well, we can fill that in later. 
OK. Describe the base for me. It was an old

21:04.408 --> 21:05.810
Luftwaffe base. It had big pillows with swat 
stickers on it going inside. It had nice big

21:14.538 --> 21:17.100
barracks and a good runway. They

21:17.140 --> 21:24.347
didn't destroy it? Why not? They may have 
destroyed a few things on it. They didn't ruin the

21:29.231 --> 21:30.733
runway? They got out too quickly. They hadn't 
moved in too quickly. They really did. Now, of

21:39.750 --> 21:43.516
course, when you'd come back and land, you'd land 
back in Germany. Did you ever have any dealings

21:44.618 --> 21:48.463
during the war time with the German people?

22:00.141 --> 22:00.942
Not really. Not until after the war. Okay. Okay.

22:11.091 --> 22:23.090
You continued through the end of the war then, 
right down to April, May 1945, to get support to the

22:11.091 --> 22:23.090
Third Army. Yeah. That was your primary mission 
then? Well, no. No, that's not true. Oh, okay. Then

22:27.216 --> 22:28.498
what was?

22:32.191 --> 22:34.173
The 7th Army came up from the south. And after the 
7th Army came up, then we were transferred to the

22:35.434 --> 22:44.083
19th Tactical Air Command and the 9th Tactical Air 
Command. And we covered the 7th Army from then on.

22:48.969 --> 22:53.794
We covered the 7th Army and then from then on came 
the war. Were there any differences in working the

22:53.834 --> 22:57.017
3rd versus the 7th?

23:01.739 --> 23:16.819
Well, the 7th

23:01.739 --> 23:16.819
didn't have all the tanks and armor, although they 
had some. Sure. But

23:18.321 --> 23:31.358
until the winter was over, we were pretty well 
stagnated, it seemed to me. They weren't moving

23:31.658 --> 23:32.980
much.

23:35.883 --> 23:39.808
We waited until the spring and moved out. Our 
relationship with them were very good. Did they

23:45.715 --> 23:48.859
supply you like that? Did they try to keep you 
around? Well, no, they didn't do that, but they did

23:51.322 --> 23:55.607
visit us.

23:59.705 --> 24:01.807
And we worked with him. We sent forward air 
controllers up to work with him. We had that direct

24:07.915 --> 24:11.299
association through our pilots. They would go up 
to the ground controllers with riding tanks with

24:11.679 --> 24:25.375
them and direct the aircraft

24:11.679 --> 24:25.375
in to the targets. April of 1945, you changed jobs, 
and you became the air inspector. Is that right? At

24:32.643 --> 24:33.925
the 64th Fighter Wing. Why? Why'd they change you 
from combat duty to an inspector position? Well,

24:40.032 --> 24:42.115
combat was over. Basically. Basically over. 
Well, it was over before I left.

24:52.047 --> 24:54.990
They figured the group would be going home. I 
wanted to stay, so I took this job to the golf

24:55.443 --> 25:04.993
course. You wanted to stay on. You had made up your 
mind that you did not want to go back to the United

25:06.995 --> 25:15.184
States, even though... No, I wanted to go into the 
city. Okay, that's just the next question. And I

25:17.486 --> 25:23.813
had made arrangements with this wing who said they 
were going, and I wanted to go with them.

25:29.092 --> 25:33.417
I was picked off the 64th. The 12th Tactical Air 
Command? I thought they were gone? No, there was

25:39.143 --> 25:41.245
another one. It was a medium bomber.

25:46.791 --> 25:57.462
I

25:46.791 --> 25:57.462
was picked off the 64th, and then the 12th 
Tactical, the boss of the 64th, pulled me out of

25:46.791 --> 25:57.462
there. and put me in the Air Inspector's job. And 
then they had a colonel come in and he came in and

26:03.212 --> 26:12.185
they put him over me, so I was an assistant

26:03.212 --> 26:12.185
Air Inspector. Did you like the job of being an 
inspector? I didn't particularly relish the job

26:15.370 --> 26:20.377
of being an inspector, but I did learn a lot. I 
learned a whole lot as an inspector. About what?

26:24.603 --> 26:26.065
About administration. of different modes of the 
Air Force. And I got ideas from other people on how

26:32.117 --> 26:38.005
to do things. And gave them some, too. How to get the 
job done. Yes. What were the problems in Germany

26:42.210 --> 26:49.619
right as soon as the war ended, as far as the Air 
Force was concerned? Well, number one problem was

26:49.639 --> 26:51.482
BD. Yeah, I would imagine.

26:57.652 --> 27:05.984
How'd you

26:57.652 --> 27:05.984
try to resolve those? Well, it was made a command 
function to resolve them. And what did you do to try

27:12.494 --> 27:15.839
to, I mean, what actions did you take? You mean as 
the air inspector? Yeah. Well, we brought the

27:19.705 --> 27:25.313
problems to the attention of the command. And they 
took it

27:25.850 --> 27:43.612
from

27:25.850 --> 27:43.612
there. We took over the air drone at Swineford. And 
that's where I started working in the journey.

27:55.972 --> 28:02.278
Before we started working with the Germans, 
during this time did you also work with the

27:55.972 --> 28:02.278
Russians? No. I never saw a Russian. You never saw a 
Russian? Did you ever hear any stories about the

28:06.963 --> 28:09.605
Russians? Or did you ever have any feelings toward 
the Russians one way or the other? Well, I felt that

28:13.749 --> 28:24.460
I strongly feel that Mr.

28:13.749 --> 28:24.460
Roosevelt He gave away the

28:25.165 --> 28:38.557
fact that, I mean, he gave away the option of us 
going and being into Berlin first, which we would

28:25.165 --> 28:38.557
be. I think he gave that away to Mr. Stalin. And we 
were damn mad about it. All of us. Because you

28:49.486 --> 28:51.608
wanted to continue on into Berlin? I wanted to 
continue on into Berlin, and we wanted to...

28:57.160 --> 29:04.750
We wanted to get as much of Germany as we could 
before the Russians got there. Well, they were our

29:04.770 --> 29:07.053
allies at the time, much as they were. Why did you 
want to commit your troops and take on the

29:07.133 --> 29:17.527
possibility of more American bloodshed if they 
were going to be our allies? Well, we didn't think

29:17.547 --> 29:25.498
that we were going to be more American, much more 
than any bloodshed, or if any. We think that it was

29:25.518 --> 29:26.880
all political. We

29:27.164 --> 29:33.132
did not like the Russians. You didn't like the 
Russians even before the war was over? Even before

29:35.976 --> 29:44.827
the war was over, because of communism.

29:44.847 --> 29:47.551
But you didn't work with any Russians yourself? 
No. This is just the general feeling. The general

29:49.974 --> 29:50.615
feeling. OK.

29:58.180 --> 30:02.848
What was your mission as the commander of the 86th 
Fighter Group? You said you started working with

30:02.868 --> 30:04.471
the Germans. In what way? Well, no, we worked with 
the local Germans. Okay. Burgermeisters and

30:08.799 --> 30:11.944
stuff. We had to

30:11.964 --> 30:20.880
coordinate the supplies and stuff. assist in 
getting themselves back on their

30:22.733 --> 30:35.892
own feet and taking care of themselves. We had a 
mission of flying and making our presence known.

30:41.760 --> 30:49.871
We flew regularly all over just to let them know 
that we were

30:41.760 --> 30:49.871
there. And we stayed prepared to it. to fight, too. 
And if anything happened, we would have worked

30:54.636 --> 31:18.167
with the Army, who had taken over the, who had these 
political officers, I guess you'd call them, that

30:54.636 --> 31:18.167
took over

30:54.636 --> 31:18.167
the supervision of the government of the 
Burgermeister.

31:18.187 --> 31:20.230
And we had a liaison with them. And then we, of 
course, had this air base. We had some of the German

31:23.958 --> 31:34.549
people there that worked there and continued 
working.

31:34.569 --> 31:36.772
And we had some displaced persons. They may have 
been Russians or they may have been Poles. I don't

31:38.834 --> 31:41.878
know what they were that we had to send back. Well, 
we used them as civilian employees on the base. We

31:46.283 --> 31:48.825
fed them, housed them. Did you eventually have to 
send them back? We turned them over to the Army. I

31:54.153 --> 31:59.259
don't know what

31:54.153 --> 31:59.259
they did. How did you get along with the conquered 
enemy? We didn't have any problems. No problems

32:05.227 --> 32:07.990
with the Germans? No. Except we had problems with 
BD. What were the feelings toward the Germans?

32:27.963 --> 32:29.785
Well, we weren't particularly hostile. We 
thought they

32:29.885 --> 32:34.911
were a victim of hit and run. And I can remember when 
I first went with the 12th Tactical Air Command, my

32:34.931 --> 32:46.464
friend and I moved into a doctor's house. He left 
everything there.

32:55.114 --> 32:55.434
We just went in. We never saw him.

33:01.763 --> 33:06.770
It didn't last long, but it was quite nice. And our 
quarters at Swineford were very good, too. Of

33:12.178 --> 33:17.426
course, that place had been beaten up. We had 
bombed that several times, but we put in our own

33:18.968 --> 33:24.777
runway. There was still a plank runway. Some of the 
barracks were undamaged and used then.

33:31.733 --> 33:44.346
When you heard that the United States dropped the 
atomic bomb and that the war in the Pacific was

33:31.733 --> 33:44.346
over, how did you feel about that?

33:44.366 --> 33:50.892
Well, I was glad to hear it was

33:44.366 --> 33:50.892
over. I think we all were. It was a relief, too. Yet 
at the same time, now you wouldn't be able to have

33:52.954 --> 33:56.678
more combat missions. Well, that wasn't going to 
bother me. It was over.

34:12.609 --> 34:16.074
That's not to say that I want to go out and apply 
combat. Just apply combat. I don't. It's scary.

34:22.463 --> 34:24.626
It's not... It's not... I think it's hazardous to 
your health. Yeah, that's right. It's surgeon

34:29.901 --> 34:32.584
general, like I said. I got shot up, I guess, at 
least 15 times. You did? Yeah. Shot down once,

34:39.992 --> 34:44.096
but shot up. Do you consider yourself lucky? Very

34:46.258 --> 34:51.944
lucky. Extremely lucky. Were you, besides your 
nose,

34:58.083 --> 35:13.857
During

34:58.083 --> 35:13.857
this time, 1945 to 1947, America's armed forces 
dwindled from 12 million down to a million and a

34:58.083 --> 35:13.857
half. Rapid demobilization. Explosive 
demobilization, I'd say. That was the situation

35:20.644 --> 35:22.505
in Germany. The rail was low, and people had lots of 
points. He had morale problems like what I

35:28.255 --> 35:34.401
did. Farmed a football team.

35:38.684 --> 35:42.067
A classmate of mine at this point now that coaches. 
We won the USA championship. No kidding. We had a

35:44.870 --> 35:47.372
lot of fun. So in other words, you directed 
sporting events. Yeah. Well, we had other things

35:52.637 --> 35:55.860
too. We got him the permission to go deer hunting. 
Really? Yeah. We shot a lot of deer. Where'd they

36:01.874 --> 36:02.455
go? They went in the woods. There were lots of woods 
in town. Oh, yeah. And lots of deer.

36:10.506 --> 36:11.568
We enjoyed venison, too. For officers and men? 
Yeah. Did you set up an officer's club and EM club?

36:18.298 --> 36:18.638
Oh, yes. They had nice... And they also had Red 
Cross clubs. Did you try to bring in movies or movie

36:24.186 --> 36:26.529
stars? We had movies.

36:32.245 --> 36:33.607
And then we started there. We had B.B. Daniels at 
the Pond Tarsen right after B. Day. We had Spike

36:38.893 --> 36:47.984
Jones stayed with us at Pond Tarsen for just a 
couple of weeks. And they went out to the various

36:48.145 --> 36:52.390
Army units. Of course, we were Army too then. And 
played for them and played for us at our club. And

36:58.497 --> 36:58.978
they stood in. We set up an officer's club and an 
enlisted man's club everywhere we went. We did it

37:05.199 --> 37:09.145
with a tent.

37:10.547 --> 37:12.450
As far as... Good for morale. Sure. And did you 
actually feel that you increased more? Yes. We had

37:19.240 --> 37:23.185
hires for you in our organization, Michael. Very 
much. All your friends and a lot of the associates

37:25.909 --> 37:28.493
and a lot of pilots

37:33.468 --> 37:34.729
back into civilian life. At any time did you feel 
that you wanted to go back into civilian life? None

37:40.255 --> 37:40.936
whatsoever. As a matter of fact, my father offered 
me the opportunity. He said before he wanted me to

37:45.300 --> 37:50.406
come in the business with me and my brother. He 
said, no, I want to stay in the

37:50.426 --> 37:54.510
airport. Thought I found a career. I enjoyed 
flying.

38:00.696 --> 38:01.517
I don't understand it. I thought

38:03.708 --> 38:12.621
it was an opportunity. It gave me an opportunity as 
a major to have a colonel's job. And I was on the list

38:16.987 --> 38:23.396
to be promoted to lieutenant colonel when the war 
ended. No, they didn't. No, they realized

38:26.561 --> 38:30.306
demobilization, they wouldn't need that many 
officers. Okay, so through 1946, until 1946, you

38:31.079 --> 38:41.875
were the deputy commander of 64th Fighter Wing? 
Well, that was a consolidation. It looks like it.

38:50.887 --> 38:56.115
It was a consolidation of the Fighter Wing and the 
group. And they just moved the Fighter Wing, which

38:56.135 --> 39:01.002
looked at a a town near there that moved them out 
there to the air base. And the wing ran the group, I

39:05.282 --> 39:20.564
mean ran the organization there, and also all the 
other fighter planes that were

39:05.282 --> 39:20.564
under. So it was just a... Well, there was a lot of 
consolidation at this time. They sent the 86

39:24.249 --> 39:28.896
fighter group home. and the people that were 
eligible to go, went. The rest of the regular

39:36.163 --> 39:50.485
officers that were there stayed,

39:36.163 --> 39:50.485
and the others that didn't have enough

39:36.163 --> 39:50.485
points to go. In 1946, though, you have a rather 
unusual assignment, which lasts from May 46 to

39:50.505 --> 39:57.516
September 47, and that's that the officers

40:00.905 --> 40:03.389
I was a master of the sword. Oh, what's a master of 
the sword? It's the physical education

40:08.536 --> 40:15.426
department. And what did you do there? This is kind 
of an unusual assignment for a fighter pilot.

40:28.917 --> 40:31.301
It wasn't the Air Force then, I was in the Army 
still. Yeah, sure, still the Army Air Corps. And

40:33.924 --> 40:42.377
West Point had pretty high priority on selecting 
who they wanted for instructors. And I was

40:42.397 --> 40:53.794
selected by the

40:42.397 --> 40:53.794
Director of Physical Education, if you will, or 
the Master of the Sword, to come there and be a...

40:54.753 --> 41:07.130
What I did, I came home on R&R expecting to go back to 
Germany and get a good job in the 64th Fighter Wing.

41:07.570 --> 41:16.102
But while I was home on R&R, my orders were changed 
and I was sent to West Point to be an instructor.

41:16.122 --> 41:17.183
What were your feelings about that? I was highly 
pissed off. I wanted to be, I got married, and I

41:20.437 --> 41:26.143
wanted to be the first guy back to Germany with his 
wife. And my classmate, one of my classmates did

41:27.605 --> 41:31.670
just that. He was the first guy to have his wife over 
there. Because by this time, the Army allowed

41:36.015 --> 41:39.659
people to have dependents. Yeah. But you could 
still have her at West Point. Oh, I did. Two of our

41:46.386 --> 41:47.828
children were born there. And she enjoyed 
wrestling.

41:53.734 --> 41:55.016
And I did enjoy it, too. But I did not want to get out 
of flying airplanes. And did you like instructing

42:01.422 --> 42:03.325
cadets? I enjoyed them. And physical education. 
Yeah, I know. But what type? I mean, what did you?

42:10.693 --> 42:12.474
Well, I taught wrestling. Wrestling. And I was on 
the wrestling team. I taught wrestling. I taught

42:19.972 --> 42:25.058
administration of athletic programs. I taught 
football coaching. I

42:26.840 --> 42:33.727
taught calisthenics. Why do you have an engineer 
teaching this? I wasn't an engineer. Well, true,

42:38.293 --> 42:47.683
you were an army officer, but you had an 
engineering background and a mathematical

42:38.293 --> 42:47.683
background.

42:53.452 --> 42:59.560
They select the instructors up there based on 
their records. I had played football and I coached

42:59.580 --> 43:10.053
football there in my last year

42:59.580 --> 43:10.053
as one of the coaches there. I played lacrosse and I 
played a lot of sports and of course

43:10.073 --> 43:17.603
the wrestling team.

43:22.510 --> 43:24.693
this was the type of person that he wanted. Now, is 
there any tension between the returning

43:25.774 --> 43:38.171
veterans, combat hardened veterans, and the new 
cadets who are just starting out at West Point? Any

43:38.191 --> 43:43.698
tension, or do they look up to you, or, you know, 
this is a peculiar time? No, because they had in

43:44.660 --> 43:50.307
the, they had in the, in the, in the Corps, they had 
guys that had had combat.

43:56.054 --> 43:57.756
And they were in the Corps. And they were looked up 
to. They really were. So they had individual

44:02.763 --> 44:14.198
people who had been enlisted men then who had gone 
to Europe and now they, after combat they had, they

44:02.763 --> 44:14.198
received appointments to West Point to start. 
Some of them had been, even one guy had been a

44:14.278 --> 44:18.203
captain. No kidding. And a pilot. Mm-hmm. But in 
the reserve.

44:28.665 --> 44:30.848
And then when he was commissioned, what did they 
commission him as? He had already been

44:31.028 --> 44:34.133
commissioned, so what did they commission him? He 
resigned that commission. He resigned the

44:35.434 --> 44:40.601
commission to go to... Well, he doesn't have to 
resign his reserve commission. He goes in as a vet.

44:43.265 --> 44:47.511
He still is a reserve captain.

44:47.531 --> 44:49.133
That's a peculiar situation. Yeah, it was a 
peculiar situation.

44:54.749 --> 44:56.131
They looked up to him. Yeah, they really did.

45:00.856 --> 45:12.309
During this time, of course, there was an attempt, 
which was successful, to separate the Army Air

45:00.856 --> 45:12.309
Corps from the Army and make it the Air Force. What 
were your feelings on this? I was elated. Why? I

45:17.375 --> 45:18.937
wanted to be separate from the Army. Well, you were 
a West Point graduate. That had nothing to do with

45:21.700 --> 45:24.503
it, in terms of air power. Because air power was 
subordinated to people who didn't know enough

45:24.803 --> 45:31.752
about it. And they proved that when they made the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff. Even during the war,

45:37.219 --> 45:51.638
the head of the Air Corps was made General of the Air 
Force, General Arnold.

45:54.908 --> 46:17.999
The three separate services, in my opinion, the 
Air Force should not be subordinated to the Army,

45:54.908 --> 46:17.999
because it goes beyond the Army, where the Army is 
not even involved in strategic bombing and so

45:54.908 --> 46:17.999
forth. So all of us that were in the Air Corps, Happy 
to serve

46:24.541 --> 46:33.918
in the Air

46:24.541 --> 46:33.918
Force. You just wanted your independence.

46:40.429 --> 46:43.394
And commanding and being under command yourself. 
Yeah, and being under commanders. Who were Air

46:47.341 --> 46:48.303
Corps people. Air Corps people and not Army. You 
were

46:49.972 --> 47:10.865
teaching at West Point at the time with a lot of Army 
officers who were not Air Corps types. What were

47:12.087 --> 47:15.152
the feelings toward this?
