WEBVTT

00:01.988 --> 00:06.794
cards on Saturday night, and they prided 
themselves on eating my son a cake on Saturday. Of

00:07.215 --> 00:12.682
course butter was so hard to gather, but my mother 
had given me a recipe for an eggless, butterless,

00:07.215 --> 00:12.682
milkless cake. And the Chinaman's cook told the 
boys out at the hotel that he couldn't make cake

00:13.243 --> 00:19.831
because he didn't have any butter or eggs. And they 
said, well, senor makes a cake with no butter and no

00:19.851 --> 00:24.758
eggs. And the Chinaman said, what is that? And the 
boys said it over again to him. He said, es mentira.

00:33.528 --> 00:53.958
eggless,

00:33.528 --> 00:53.958
butterless,

00:33.528 --> 00:53.958
and milkless

00:33.528 --> 00:53.958
cake that you made during the war, or like fruit 
cake. But they always called it my Mantera cake. We

00:57.864 --> 00:58.986
had, I guess, a crew about, I guess, an office. He 
had an assistant superintendent and an assayer

00:59.006 --> 01:01.449
and engineer, five or six men who were all either 
Americans or English. And then they I think they

01:02.165 --> 01:16.321
had men in the

01:02.165 --> 01:16.321
right over the miners

01:02.165 --> 01:16.321
who thought it was a Mexican foreman. So they 
thought

01:16.341 --> 01:22.148
they were operating it really under Mexican 
control, because they didn't have a Mexican

01:16.341 --> 01:22.148
foreman. Did any of the other engineers bring 
their wives at a later time? Well, you see, this was

01:25.011 --> 01:26.653
sort of an unsettled time down there. There was one 
other couple, and then an engineer and his wife, he

01:27.376 --> 01:42.457
was a Purdue University man, and his wife came down 
to install a power plant down at the railroad

01:27.376 --> 01:42.457
station, and they stayed with us for six or eight 
months. And I think there was one other couple at

01:42.477 --> 01:44.941
one time, but they sort of came and went. They were 
only there for a short

01:44.961 --> 01:49.387
period. They

01:49.407 --> 01:54.674
were... It was a... an interesting life, but I'm 
sorry I don't have more of the details. Mine is sort

02:00.001 --> 02:01.365
of a rambling. It's been a very interesting story, 
and you've had a lot of interesting details. I

02:06.321 --> 02:07.785
certainly do appreciate it. It's been a pleasure 
talking with you. name and uh when you were born and

02:12.112 --> 02:37.900
and just i forgot to ask you well that's that's 
rather personal oh well you don't have to say when

02:12.112 --> 02:37.900
you were born just no i don't mind i was born in i was 
born in salem indiana and my maiden name was jones

02:12.112 --> 02:37.900
kemp k-e-m-p camp and and i um that was in december 
12 1887. wait a minute Yes, 1887, so I'm 85. And then

02:43.280 --> 02:51.650
when I was in college, my family moved to 
California, so I was married in California. I

02:51.670 --> 02:56.456
married a man from Michigan who was living in 
California at the time. And then after he

02:56.476 --> 03:01.322
graduated from Stanford, of course, he went to the 
mining business and carried me down there. Did he

03:02.332 --> 03:07.418
ever have any occasion to talk about or to know 
Hoover? Yes, he had very, he always said that his

03:08.239 --> 03:12.925
middle name was Hoover. He, when Mr. Adams was a, in 
college, Mr. Hoover, Mr. and Ms. Hoover came there

03:12.945 --> 03:22.837
to address the geology club with which Mr. Adams 
was president. So he met them personally and

03:22.858 --> 03:24.880
she'll pick them over then. them over the campus 
and all. Always a very sweet recollection of his

03:28.840 --> 03:31.542
visit with the Hoovers. And then when, later, when 
we went to New York and Mr. Hoover was living at the

03:32.183 --> 03:41.291
Waldorf, the Strattons called on him. And that was 
one of the highlights of his life. Mr. Hoover never

03:45.694 --> 03:49.658
forgot old acquaintances. Of course, he knew all 
the old Stanford props and all, so he had a great

03:49.678 --> 03:56.183
deal to talk over.

04:06.997 --> 04:09.852
Nowadays tape recorders work fine.

16:51.063 --> 16:59.335
Yeah, one of the great values is, from the 
standpoint of linguistics and, of course, the

16:51.063 --> 16:59.335
recording of the story as it's told by the person 
involved.
