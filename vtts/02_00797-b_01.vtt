00:01.499 --> 00:26.224
See,

00:01.499 --> 00:26.224
there was concern that the Japanese might be able 
to start some diseases against livestock which

00:01.499 --> 00:26.224
were highly contagious and easily transmitted 
diseases that could spread across the country and

00:01.499 --> 00:26.224
be very damaging to U.S. and Canadian food supply. 
That was one of the main reasons for our program on

00:27.554 --> 00:33.865
Rinderpest in Canada at War Disease Control 
Station. During that period of time in 42 and 43,

00:36.048 --> 00:53.798
the Japanese launched literally hundreds of hot 
air balloons in Japan, which because of

00:36.048 --> 00:53.798
prevailing air currents at about 60,000 feet were 
able to fly over to the United States and Canada on

00:54.200 --> 01:00.350
their own. In very large numbers they came. And we 
were all concerned that they might load these with

01:04.316 --> 01:17.377
contagious disease materials which when they 
landed here in the United States and Canada would

01:04.316 --> 01:17.377
be picked up by livestock and spread all over the 
country. But fortunately the security was so good

01:20.373 --> 01:30.087
that the Japanese never learned that their 
balloons were getting here, that they were

01:20.373 --> 01:30.087
launching in Japan during that time period. So 
though there were lots of them came, and we had US

01:31.369 --> 01:44.929
and Canadian aircraft out beating these balloons 
down, and then men picking up material from them

01:31.369 --> 01:44.929
and bringing them to our lab, which we tested in 
cattle and livestock. We never picked up a hot

01:45.820 --> 01:49.604
disease from any of that material. What did they 
send? Well, they sent a few of these hand grenades

01:51.466 --> 02:02.857
and bombs over, which would explode when they were 
touched by people. And there were just a few people

02:02.977 --> 02:06.721
killed with these. But for the most part, they 
continued to send them because they used them as a

02:06.881 --> 02:14.308
propaganda tool for their munitions plants in 
Japan. They'd have a big gathering and launch a lot

02:19.973 --> 02:31.584
of these balloons and tell their workers that they 
were sending these over there to wipe out the

02:19.973 --> 02:31.584
Canadians and the US citizens, and launch a lot of 
them. But they didn't know they were getting here,

02:31.844 --> 02:33.967
but they were. They were coming. It's surprising 
that they didn't send any disease, because they

02:35.808 --> 02:40.833
were working on these things. That's right, they 
were. And they could have sent them, but Not

02:45.203 --> 02:52.050
thinking they were getting here, they didn't load 
them, except with a few little bombs and things. I

02:52.070 --> 02:53.612
was wondering about another thing, too. And that 
is, I forgot to ask you about this when we were

02:53.892 --> 02:58.096
talking earlier about it. We were talking about 
the relationships with government. I was

03:00.759 --> 03:04.944
wondering about the relationship that you and the 
Institute had with the Colombian government. How

03:05.524 --> 03:06.946
did that work? Well, it worked very well. And we had 
actually very little to do with it, because that

03:08.367 --> 03:14.974
had been well established by the Rockefeller 
Foundation. They had a very good liaison with the

03:16.287 --> 03:20.693
Colombian government. And many of the higher 
Colombian officials had received graduate

03:20.914 --> 03:30.447
training in the United States with scholarships 
provided by the Rockefeller Foundation. So they

03:31.409 --> 03:37.838
were in an excellent standing with Rockefeller 
and accepted us as part of that overall team. So we

03:37.998 --> 03:39.500
had no problems there. Did a lot of the technicians 
and the researchers, did a lot of them know

03:40.221 --> 03:46.210
Spanish? Yes, that's right. So there was a good 
communication between the UN and the Colombian

03:48.673 --> 03:54.641
veterinarians. And we usually had some Colombian 
veterinarians and technicians working with us

03:55.201 --> 04:00.969
down there. So it was a joint effort. How were the 
facilities? They were excellent. They were

04:06.135 --> 04:08.698
provided really by the Rockefeller Foundation. 
They furnished us with excellent labs both in

04:09.760 --> 04:15.707
Bogota and down in Cali. And it was a good 
arrangement, really, because we would typically

04:16.514 --> 04:33.254
have a Colombian veterinarian who was our field 
man that would make contacts with livestock

04:16.514 --> 04:33.254
producers and people with whom we would work in the 
field. For example, they would make the

04:34.336 --> 04:44.648
arrangements for us to go out and vaccinate a 
year's crop of calves for a vaccination trial. and

04:45.100 --> 05:02.421
work it all out, and we'd go do the work and follow 
through with them, and the farmer would benefit,

04:45.100 --> 05:02.421
and the local government would benefit from it, 
and everybody would be happy, and we weren't so

04:45.100 --> 05:02.421
directly involved with local people, you see, 
because of that, which made it easy for us. Sure,

05:02.761 --> 05:05.725
you didn't have to set things up. And how did the 
people, the farmers or the peasants, how did they

05:05.745 --> 05:11.091
respond to you? Well, there was never any problem. 
We got along very well. They were probably very

05:14.767 --> 05:16.910
happy to see you coming. Did you ever do any work 
with the Peace Corps? No. No, I never did. Because

05:24.341 --> 05:28.927
the Peace Corps must have, I'm sure they were in 
Columbia at that time. Yes, they were. And they

05:30.069 --> 05:35.497
must have been doing some similar type work, 
vaccinations, building things. Most of their

05:35.817 --> 05:41.145
efforts were with people rather than with 
livestock, so we didn't have. You know, we knew

05:41.969 --> 05:48.517
about their presence and would meet them from time 
to time, but we didn't have much to do with it. Why'd

05:48.537 --> 05:49.318
you retire? Well, because I became 67 years old, 
and the university retired everybody at that time

05:51.100 --> 06:03.596
when they were 65 or thereabouts, you see, and I 
stayed on two more years. Now I think they'll let

06:04.838 --> 06:08.382
you stay on to age 70, but they didn't at that time. 
Yeah, I would have been happy to stay on for quite a

06:10.471 --> 06:15.877
few more years because I have good health and good 
shape. No reason not to. In fact, I've been busier

06:18.980 --> 06:24.646
in many ways since I left out there than I was 
before. Which brings me to another question. What

06:26.728 --> 06:28.630
have you been doing since retirement? Well, my son 
and I started an insulation business here in town

06:28.650 --> 06:33.755
in 1977. And we're still going strong with that. 
What's the name of it? Insulate. Oh, really?

06:41.176 --> 06:41.997
That's your company? Yeah, that's my company. And 
my son is over there. Does he run it, then, on the

06:45.981 --> 06:48.243
day-to-day business? Yeah, and I spend a lot of 
time over there, too. I still do. I kept the books

06:52.327 --> 07:01.036
for the first two and a half years, using a little of 
my accounting training from Idaho. And in the

07:01.056 --> 07:04.680
meantime, I've bought 15 rent houses here in town. 
No kidding. And I maintain those myself, and my

07:06.381 --> 07:09.925
wife and I do. between the rent houses and the 
insulation business and a little bit of

07:11.002 --> 07:26.822
occasional consulting work, plus a book of poems 
and making chimes and some land out in the country

07:11.002 --> 07:26.822
to play with. I don't like for things to do. And I've 
been director of the Bank of A&M since 1967. Serve

07:33.811 --> 07:37.836
on some committees up there. Before that, from 
about 67 to 80,

07:39.723 --> 07:53.779
I was a third owner of the ornamental castings 
company out here that makes ornamental things. My

07:53.799 --> 07:57.283
son was out there until he shifted over to these 
other things. Now, why'd you shift to Enslade?

08:00.407 --> 08:05.593
Well, Al got tired of working in that job and wanted 
to do something more on his own. So he left out there

08:05.613 --> 08:08.937
and I sold my most of my stock from ornamental 
casting. He started his insulation business. It

08:16.679 --> 08:30.998
was really the first one in town that had the first 
energy store in town where we sold stoves and solar

08:16.679 --> 08:30.998
screens and a lot of things along with the 
insulation work. Now it's become more

08:33.381 --> 08:34.943
competitive. There are about a half a dozen 
operations in town now. How's business been?

08:40.452 --> 08:48.165
Well, it's slacked off a bit for that reason, and so 
now Al is interested in selling it and doing

08:40.452 --> 08:48.165
something else to get out of it. He'd like to get in 
some other thing. But we've never lacked for

08:55.015 --> 08:57.159
things to do. Now, is there something else that 
I've missed that we should talk about as far as the

08:59.602 --> 09:03.789
Institute is concerned? I don't really think so.

09:09.008 --> 09:15.275
I don't know best how to handle this problem of its 
current status out there. I don't want to be unfair

09:16.856 --> 09:19.900
to anybody. I don't like to downgrade somebody 
just because I don't agree with what they've done.

09:28.149 --> 09:38.880
I just hope that that administrative level can be 
squared away and made to realize that there's an

09:28.149 --> 09:38.880
opportunity there that we should all take 
advantage of. So, I'll need to edit that part of

09:39.637 --> 09:47.365
this thing pretty carefully. Well, thank you very 
much for this interview and we'll come out and

09:47.385 --> 09:51.621
we'll get...

10:11.193 --> 10:18.250
¶¶

10:37.484 --> 10:39.826
John Philip Sousa's Stars and Stripes Forever. 
And this Naval Academy graduate who sits to my left

10:39.886 --> 10:43.530
was at attention during that one. Oh, I was ready to 
march. Ready to go. Going to sign up and go back in,

10:47.114 --> 10:48.635
huh? Halftime. The University of Arkansas band 
has concluded its halftime presentation.

11:03.390 --> 11:04.791
And out on the field once more.

11:50.198 --> 12:18.670
And

11:50.198 --> 12:18.670
the Saints go marching in the Razorback band as the 
Arkansas Razorback football team gets back on the

11:50.198 --> 12:18.670
field ready to initiate

12:20.101 --> 12:44.522
Lou Holtz and his crowd seventeen and three in the 
last couple of years and the Aggies are making

12:20.101 --> 12:44.522
their reappearance to

12:20.101 --> 12:44.522
A&M scored the first touchdown of the ballgame 
sixty seven yard kickoff return set it up and

12:20.101 --> 12:44.522
here's the touchdown and Robert Belcher the 
fullback on the straight inside power play good

12:20.101 --> 12:44.522
blocking pattern up front he cuts back into that 
little crease and gets into the end zone. Extra

12:45.329 --> 12:46.972
point by Tony Franklin. Good. Aggies led 7-0. Then 
a fumble recovery by Arkansas. 27 yards out. Set up

12:52.923 --> 12:54.907
this touchdown run by Ron Kalkagny. Ron Kalkagny 
is a super runner of the option play. And near the

12:58.233 --> 13:01.900
goal line, he's instructed not to pitch it unless 
he has to. And he follows a good blocking pattern up

13:01.920 --> 13:05.768
front and drives straight into the end zone. 
Tremendous execution of the power option keeper.

13:09.022 --> 13:14.029
That extra point good tied the score seven seven 
ish or done is has towed two field goals. That's the

13:14.449 --> 13:15.491
difference right now. Thirteen seven as the 
options are being discussed to begin the second

13:15.531 --> 13:29.410
half and Arkansas will receive the second half 
kickoff

13:15.531 --> 13:29.410
and they are calling the hogs here in Arkansas 
right now.

13:39.329 --> 13:51.421
And one more time man if I were a hog I'd

13:39.329 --> 13:51.421
come. Tony Franklin leads his team in scoring with 
fifty three points. He's not a bad kicker. He has

13:55.345 --> 13:59.730
all or part of 16 NCAA records. And. Hiram Wright 
Junior from Topeka Kansas number 20 back to.

14:06.397 --> 14:07.138
received the kick. He is the middleman of three. 
James Talbert and Gary Woods are also back there.

14:11.223 --> 14:16.791
Thomas Brown, who usually does the kick return 
chores for Arkansas, out with a bruised shoulder.

14:17.552 --> 14:18.453
Tony Franklin. He's going to have to make an 
adjustment. He's going to have to put another shoe

14:19.955 --> 14:21.878
on in the NFL. He says he's been practicing with the 
extra shoe and it doesn't bother him. He just

14:24.802 --> 14:26.083
prefers kicking barefoot. Here's Hiram Wright at 
the 25. Gets out of attack by Doug Carr, but boom.

14:32.251 --> 14:34.935
Baldwin makes the stuff. Keith Baldwin

14:35.523 --> 14:41.929
will be thinking about that one after the game. 
Special teams guys are really a certain breed.

14:48.595 --> 14:56.443
This game was very even through the first 15 
minutes of play but Arkansas had seven first downs

14:48.595 --> 14:56.443
in the second quarter. None for the Aggies and 
they've got a first down 10 now at their own twenty

14:56.823 --> 15:03.910
nine yard line Cal Cagney option right side that 
picks up four yards. Reset the offensive

15:04.598 --> 15:07.362
backfield for the University of Arkansas. The 
senior quarterback is Ron Calcagna, number 18.

15:10.547 --> 15:13.371
Jerry Eckwood and Ben Collins in the offensive 
backfield with him. And up front, an offensive

15:14.553 --> 15:23.386
line that now includes Burt Locke, Chuck Herman, 
Mike Burlingame, George Stewart, Greg Kalenda,

15:14.553 --> 15:23.386
and the tight end Charles Clay. The wide receivers 
are Robert Farrell and Gary Stiggers, but now

15:23.406 --> 15:27.572
Donnie Bobo has come in. He is wide to the right 
side. It's second down and five. left side out of

15:32.105 --> 16:01.251
the tackle post for the first down be about a foot 
short I believe defensively for Texas A&M front

15:32.105 --> 16:01.251
for Jacob Green Eugene Sanders Gary Milligan and 
James Zachary the linebackers are Floyd Randall

15:32.105 --> 16:01.251
Doug Carr and Mike Little the cornerbacks Dan 
Davis who is playing in the spot normally occupied

15:32.105 --> 16:01.251
by Darryl Smith and Elroy Steen and the safeties 
are Kenneth Taylor and Carl Grulich and they'll

15:32.105 --> 16:01.251
bring the stick out and see if Ben Collins picked up 
enough for the first down 10.

16:07.072 --> 16:09.995
Well I said a put short it's about eight or 10 
inches. Third down Arkansas with a 13 7 lead as we

16:10.035 --> 16:14.860
get underway. Berman question Ben Martin from War 
Memorial Stadium in Little Rock facility third

16:14.940 --> 16:23.149
down conversions Arkansas five out of eight. 
That's a very respectable any time you go over five

16:23.169 --> 16:29.095
hundred third and one officially. Tim Adams tied 
to the right side. Quarterback keeper by Cal

16:33.060 --> 16:37.766
Cagney went over the wedge between his center and 
right guard. And appeared to pick up enough for the

16:40.048 --> 16:41.850
first down. The Aggies are really stacked in 
there. They had four where the Hogs had three. But

16:46.676 --> 16:49.099
Cal Cagney can find any little bit of daylight.

16:51.982 --> 16:52.823
First down, Tim. Robert Farrell brings the play 
in. You see him there, number 83, just getting into

16:54.225 --> 16:58.429
the huddle. And now Farrell breaks and comes wide 
to the right side. in the company of Donnie Bobo,

17:01.002 --> 17:02.966
number 44. First down, 10. Arkansas, 13.34 to go 
third quarter. And they lead 13-7. Cal Cagney

17:09.358 --> 17:12.844
looks back to his left, has a lot of time, and 
overthrows it. Steen is down there, dropped by

17:13.185 --> 17:15.990
Steen and Carl Gerlich. The Aggies have only five 
interceptions all year. They got two of them

17:20.110 --> 17:22.414
against SMU two weeks ago. At that time, Carl 
Gerlich and Elroy Steen were battling for the

17:22.996 --> 17:26.903
ball. Now, this is a good call on first down. They 
run the option fake to the right, drop by Cal

17:28.666 --> 17:34.115
Cagney, throws it at the post, but the defenders 
are both right there. It's one of those things,

17:34.135 --> 17:37.962
Alphonse Gaston, and the ball bounces free. Big 
collision by two defenders. So that sets up a

17:42.413 --> 17:44.256
second down 10. Arkansas at their own 39. Well, 
officially the 40-yard line. Left side, pitch

17:48.703 --> 17:49.865
out. Ben Collins looks for a block from Kalenda. He 
gets the block from Kalenda, but Kenneth Taylor

17:52.389 --> 17:58.780
didn't have anybody blocking him, number 16, and 
made the tackle. Let's look at Jacob Green, number

17:58.800 --> 18:02.025
77, defensive end for Texas A&M. He's a real strong 
football player comes across sheds the block he's

18:02.562 --> 18:26.933
not influenced by that and and his responsibility 
is to get the quarterback he comes off that now he

18:02.562 --> 18:26.933
wants to get in on the action on the pitch man and 
there's kind of Taylor straightening up Mr. Ben

18:02.562 --> 18:26.933
Collins and a look at Jacob Green from Houston 
Cashmere High School six to two hundred forty two

18:02.562 --> 18:26.933
pound junior Ron a new quarterback Kevin Scanlon 
is in the ballgame across the middle caught Bobo

18:28.313 --> 18:53.865
first down at the 50 yard line Kevin Scanlon stuck 
in on us number fourteen six foot one hundred

18:28.313 --> 18:53.865
eighty five pound junior there's a look at Donnie 
Bobo Scanlon has replaced Ron Cal Cagney now Cal

18:28.313 --> 18:53.865
Cagney comes back in and Scanlon having thrown and 
completed one pass comes back to the bench that's a

18:28.313 --> 18:53.865
tough thing for a young guy to do come in get one play 
and then throw a curl in pattern right on the money

18:54.301 --> 18:56.224
First down 10 at the 50-yard line. Arkansas has had 
control since the opening kickoff of the second

18:56.284 --> 19:00.291
half. Flip to the

19:00.371 --> 19:05.560
left side. Right guard, nothing there. As Cowens 
gets the handoff, picked up one. Jacob Green in the

19:11.189 --> 19:17.760
area again with Mike Little, number 61, and Cal 
Pevito, number 51, who is the middle linebacker.

19:18.685 --> 19:22.529
Go

19:18.685 --> 19:22.529
hogs go. Arkansas National Guard. Nicely 
recruiting. Recruiting efforts. They recruit

19:30.558 --> 19:32.780
those hogs up there. Cal Cagney on second down 
nine. Farrell. Did he catch it? Did he trap it? He

19:40.649 --> 19:41.450
caught it. It's good at the 32. Down low. Farrell 
made the grab. Well they're going to talk about it.

19:50.499 --> 19:50.860
We got it. That's a judgment call. Pure and simple. 
That's why they have six officials two on each

19:54.043 --> 19:56.626
sidelines. Somebody get overruled. Here's the 
pitch. It's a roll left. It's thrown very low to

20:00.731 --> 20:04.895
this tall receiver and it's one of those 
simultaneous things. Evidently the ball hit the

20:04.955 --> 20:07.818
turf as he caught it. He didn't juggle it but 
evidently it skipped into his hands. Well Vince

20:11.903 --> 20:14.906
Buckley says no catch third down nine. Initially 
they ruled it illegal catch. And then there was a

20:18.473 --> 20:21.216
little bit of a huddle and they said nope. Come back 
try it again. That is how the A&M SMU game ended.

20:27.043 --> 20:31.128
Kenna Taylor with an interception that he later 
admitted was a trap. Here's Gal Cagney under a

20:31.148 --> 20:33.491
tremendous rush. Overthrown incomplete almost 
picked on at the 42 yard line. Mike Little got his

20:37.235 --> 20:39.418
hand on it. and thought he had the interception 
that could have been a turnover that the Aggies

20:39.635 --> 20:45.080
were really looking for. That ball was floated 
into a dangerous short middle zone. Sophomore

20:48.043 --> 20:56.031
Bruce Leahy from St. Louis Missouri averaged 
thirty nine point four this year and has kicked

20:48.043 --> 20:56.031
well this afternoon. And Hatcher Armstrong is 
back at 10 for A&M to receive the point. The return

21:00.876 --> 21:07.163
is on for the Aggies and here's the Leahy kick a 
great one into the end zone. It'll come out to the 20

21:07.403 --> 21:09.625
yards So Arkansas holds on to the ball for three and 
a half minutes, but they do not come up with any

21:11.444 --> 21:16.152
points. A 49-yard kick. A&M has the ball at the 
20-yard line when we return. Ohio Stadium is

21:20.779 --> 21:24.605
located in War Memorial Park in Little Rock, 
Arkansas. And if Ben Martin and I didn't have a

21:24.886 --> 21:28.311
plane to catch, we might go over and ride the Ferris 
wheel. That makes me ill. First down 10. Aggies get

21:31.737 --> 21:32.659
it. On the sideline. hoping that his team can 
reestablish dominance and put something

21:34.900 --> 21:38.987
offensively together here. Mike Mosley, the 
quarterback. David Brothers set a fullback. Play

21:43.294 --> 21:43.675
action. Mosley will throw on first down. Into 
double coverage. Intercepted for 50-yard line.

21:48.343 --> 21:50.366
Coming to the right side, it's Vaughn Lusby. Lusby 
at the 35 and out of bounds at the 30 as a flag is

21:50.727 --> 21:53.993
dropped. Lusby has picked off his second 
interception of 1978. Got a late hit, I think.

22:01.529 --> 22:04.572
Mosley intercepted on his first throw of the 
second half. And we'll look at it again. It's a

22:06.995 --> 22:11.120
no-no for a quarterback to set and under throw a man 
deep with double coverage. He should throw it as

22:11.140 --> 22:14.103
far as he can and let the receiver try to get under 
it. And then there's no risk of the interception.

22:17.487 --> 22:20.711
He had the coverage pretty well beaten, but it was 
under thrown. And so we get the pickoff by a great

22:20.751 --> 22:24.135
defensive back, Vaughn Lusby. And then he's 
driven out of bounds with a little bit too much

22:24.155 --> 22:27.739
enthusiasm.

22:31.752 --> 22:48.507
not too thrilled with the way things have gone 
here's a face mask violation on the tackle and they

22:31.752 --> 22:48.507
step off yardage down to the 17 yard line second 
turnover for Texas A&M they had had a fumble and a

22:31.752 --> 22:48.507
pass intercept that is R.C. Slocum the linebacker 
coach once again he and his wife Janet a couple of

22:48.547 --> 23:00.257
outstanding

23:01.992 --> 23:30.615
got a man down also Doug Holmes offensive guard for 
Texas A&M injured player trying to get down field

23:01.992 --> 23:30.615
and tackle after the interception

23:01.992 --> 23:30.615
just Tom Wilson would like to have that call back 
again you know they're trying to go for broke to

23:01.992 --> 23:30.615
make something happen here in the third quarter 
and it just backfired on him and now the hogs really

23:01.992 --> 23:30.615
have something going for them penalties in the 
ballgame Aggies have been Well, these are two

23:31.658 --> 23:39.170
football teams that have national championship 
hopes just a month ago, and they both ran into a

23:31.658 --> 23:39.170
Houston Cougars team. Arkansas's other losses to 
Texas. I had him second loss was to Baylor. After

23:45.600 --> 23:49.626
which, I made the large design of Tom Wilson. Both 
clubs have come back with two wins since then. Cal

23:52.871 --> 23:54.834
Cagney left side pitches out. Coward nailed back 
at the 19 yard line. Jacob Green was back there. And

24:00.700 --> 24:02.542
Cal Pevito, number 51. And Carl Grulich, number 
19.

24:09.829 --> 24:10.770
There's Jacob Green. 6'2", 242 pounds. He has 
tackled, not counting that one, 18 tackles for 109

24:13.312 --> 24:20.219
yards in losses this year. That's fantastic 
performance. It's second down and 12. Cal Cagney.

24:25.844 --> 24:28.547
And on Jerry Eckwood to the 10, to the 8. close to the 
first and 10 the senior from Brinkley Arkansas

24:29.489 --> 24:52.105
over right guard a block from Kalenda and Stewart 
on the right side as Kenneth Taylor and Carl

24:29.489 --> 24:52.105
Gerlich make the tackle that's a play the Lou Holtz 
calls his power dive it's a base block everybody

24:29.489 --> 24:52.105
fires out in a zone straight ahead and in the back 
just finds that little daylight to the outside

24:29.489 --> 24:52.105
third down and one at the eight thirteen seven

24:58.497 --> 25:18.008
the offensive

24:58.497 --> 25:18.008
line of scrimmage if the play stands Arkansas has a 
first and

24:58.497 --> 25:18.008
goal

25:19.220 --> 25:22.225
Well, they get half the distance here, so they have 
the option there. Vince Buckley explaining. Ron

25:24.249 --> 25:31.882
Caltagni audibilized at the line of scrimmage 
when he saw that nine-man front and broke up the

25:24.249 --> 25:31.882
cadence, so the Aggies were a little too nervous. 
They will take the penalty, get an additional yard

25:33.585 --> 25:37.552
out of it on a half-distance call. So with his first 
down goal, Arkansas at the A&M four-yard line with

25:37.572 --> 25:43.422
10.03 to go third quarter. And here come the hogs. 
Robert Carroll breaks wide left. Roland Sayles,

25:48.869 --> 25:59.222
number 21, is in the offensive backfield with 
Jerry Eckwood.

25:59.242 --> 26:02.106
Sayles has it to the three. They're going over 
Kalenda and Stewart on that right side, Ben.

26:05.149 --> 26:09.535
That's the coaching staff at Arkansas is very high 
on Greg Kalenda and Stewart. They just can fire out

26:10.116 --> 26:11.237
there. They're big kids. And the backs are used to 
running right behind them and And they really fire

26:15.498 --> 26:17.861
out along that line of scrimmage. George Stewart, 
number 74, and Greg Kalenda, number 73. Stewart is

26:21.987 --> 26:26.754
out now, and Jerry Sullivan has come in in his spot 
at right guard. Wearing number 65. It's second

26:29.378 --> 26:35.787
down goal at the

26:29.378 --> 26:35.787
three-yard line. Maybe changing at the line. Cal 
Cagney, keeper, touchdown! Flag is down also.

26:45.535 --> 27:05.878
Flag

26:45.535 --> 27:05.878
on

26:45.535 --> 27:05.878
the far side. Offside. A&M. Refused. Six points. 
Cal Fagney's second touchdown of the day. He's

27:07.440 --> 27:07.860
something else. So the Hogs have extended their 
lead to 19-7. And Ish Ordonez will try and make it

27:08.801 --> 27:09.602
27. A 17-yard drive following the pass 
interception set up by Vaughn Musby. So the

27:14.856 --> 27:19.906
Razorbacks have had to travel 27 and 17 for their 
two touchdowns this afternoon. They're gone for

27:19.926 --> 27:20.647
two. And they try to get back on the money with that 
21 points. Make it 21-7. And Ordonez is on the

27:25.416 --> 27:29.104
bench. And here come the Razorbacks with a 
two-point effort.

27:38.860 --> 27:49.292
As

27:38.860 --> 27:49.292
a good colleague they flooded his own to the right. 
On the touchdown Cal Cagney spotted a hole in the

27:51.365 --> 28:00.754
defense and he audibillized right here near the 
goal line checked to his own number came to the

27:51.365 --> 28:00.754
right and just ducked right in where that hole was. 
It was a misalignment by the Aggies on defense and

28:00.774 --> 28:04.879
he took advantage of it. You take a look at it from 
the ground level he sees the hole. Now he cuts right

28:07.862 --> 28:10.044
back inside but no one is there. And then he drives 
inside. Razorbacks have extended their lead.

28:15.089 --> 28:16.811
They have a 12 point ball now. Nineteen seven 
kickoff forthcoming.

28:22.634 --> 28:24.957
Razorbacks tried to go for two bandit work. Well 
they set it up on the left hash and they loaded up on

28:24.977 --> 28:27.760
the right. So with Cal Cagney had a lot of running 
room. He had a man open in the end zone. He just

28:31.525 --> 28:34.828
couldn't hang on because there was a little 
trouble in the throwing lane. Too bad. It's almost

28:35.750 --> 28:39.053
perfect execution of a two pointer. Fish or 
Donna's is on the kickoff as Arkansas has a

28:39.074 --> 28:44.780
nineteen seven lead now. Temple a day and Leandro 
Brown on the deep man for Texas A&M. It's a little

28:51.440 --> 29:06.417
dangerous

28:51.440 --> 29:06.417
to get Tom Wilson heart failure. He just misjudged 
that ball. You know the side wheelers when they

29:07.858 --> 29:14.826
kick that ball down there comes down there like a 
helicopter kind of slithers and goes in every

29:07.858 --> 29:14.826
direction. He just mishandled it. We have played 
just about six minutes in the third quarter. This

29:19.343 --> 29:22.567
will be A&M's second offensive play of this half. 
Curtis Dickey and David Brothers split back. They

29:25.750 --> 29:28.833
are running split back offense for the first time 
this year. Dickey left guard, not much there.

29:30.595 --> 29:32.818
Larry Jackson, number 66. Would you believe the 
veer? They're running the veer just like the hogs

29:37.183 --> 29:40.486
do. That is not David Bandy, it's Larry Jackson, 
number 66. For Arkansas. It's

29:46.975 --> 29:51.363
second down. Doug T. comes wide to the left. This 
time A&M will go for the high formation. Mosley is

30:00.339 --> 30:01.981
four out of seven for the day. Hands it off Dickey. 
Look at that sprinter speed as he gets out to the 37.

30:06.830 --> 30:07.431
Marty Mitchum made the tackle. Jimmy Walker is so 
quick on that defensive left side of the hogs line.

30:12.188 --> 30:13.469
They're going to stay away from him. He takes the 
outside and then they come off to the left side with

30:13.770 --> 30:36.253
kind of a sprint draw and Curtis Dickey cuts back 
and there he goes

30:13.770 --> 30:36.253
Curtis Dickey up to the forty five yard line 
William Hampton with the tackle

30:38.107 --> 31:01.819
we got some speculation here Ben that's 
interesting about the signal stealing going on

30:38.107 --> 31:01.819
down in the field well it happens I'll tell you if 
you wigwag signals in you you better be like Casey

30:38.107 --> 31:01.819
Stengel was and kind of flip a foolish one in there 
once in a while Well, there's some thought down on

31:02.862 --> 31:08.128
the bench that the Arkansas coaching staff is 
reading the signals. Reading the signals that Tom

31:09.650 --> 31:15.216
Wilson and his staff are wigwagging into the 
offensive level and relaying them to their

31:09.650 --> 31:15.216
defense. Well, I tell you, every staff tries it. 
Whether they're being successful or not remains

31:16.978 --> 31:19.781
to be seen. First down, Ted, at the 46-yard line. 
And off to the fullback, David Brothers from

31:23.846 --> 31:26.629
Seguin, Texas. Gets about six up for the 47. of 
Arkansas. David Brothers, 163 yard effort

31:32.726 --> 31:37.293
against Rice a couple of weeks ago. That was Cody 
Rise at number 70. One of the great offensive

31:39.597 --> 31:44.945
linemen in the Southwest Conference in the 
Arkansas defense. A&M moving the ball now. Second

31:45.966 --> 31:47.409
down and three. They pray on 19-7 with 7.44 to go 
third quarter. Mosley, the lead option to the

31:51.014 --> 31:53.698
right side. Comes back left. He'll be short of the 
first down by a couple. Jimmy Walker, number 75,

31:56.442 --> 32:00.088
made the stop.

32:01.165 --> 32:15.057
Once

32:01.165 --> 32:15.057
in a while Jimmy Walker moves over and lines up as a 
nose guard because he's really built in his

32:01.165 --> 32:15.057
aptitudes or as a nose guard he's short and strong 
and very quick and very tough to block.
