WEBVTT

00:02.866 --> 00:06.190
from the Department of IBTE at Texas A&M 
University.

00:11.416 --> 00:30.898
Today is October the 16th, and I am visiting with 
Dr. Don Clark, who has been at Texas A&M since 1967,

00:11.416 --> 00:30.898
has served as Professor of Industrial Vocational 
Technical Education, as well as Associate Dean

00:11.416 --> 00:30.898
for Research, and he will be sharing some insights 
and thoughts about the College of Education as he

00:31.115 --> 00:40.629
has perceived it since he has been here in 1967 
before it was even a College of Education

00:31.115 --> 00:40.629
formally. And Dr. Clark, I would like to maybe just 
start with change because that's been the big

00:41.651 --> 00:58.135
thing since, well always, but in the College of 
Education I know you have experienced tremendous

00:41.651 --> 00:58.135
amounts of change and probably what I would like 
for you to share is maybe what kind of impact these

00:58.486 --> 01:08.980
changes have had, whether they be political or 
sociological, on the growth and the development

00:58.486 --> 01:08.980
of the College of Education. Well, maybe a place to 
start would be to talk about my arrival at Texas A&M

01:09.121 --> 01:20.396
University in 1967 and then evolve up a little bit 
through and then interrupt along the way. When I

01:20.897 --> 01:26.805
came to Texas A&M University in 1967, we did not 
have a College of Education. Frank Hubert was then

01:27.781 --> 01:35.293
the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts, and Fred 
Benson was the Dean of the College of Engineering.

01:35.893 --> 01:43.145
And my appointment was in the College of 
Engineering, where the Department of Industrial

01:35.893 --> 01:43.145
Education resided. Within that department, we 
had the program called Industrial Education. a

01:51.052 --> 01:59.283
large percentage, 96% or more of the 
undergraduate students were in the industrial

01:51.052 --> 01:59.283
technology and industrial distribution 
programs. So therefore, the emphasis was not on

01:59.804 --> 02:06.674
teacher education, but was rather on the 
technology program. In the September of 1969 is

02:07.775 --> 02:16.767
when the College of Education became formalized 
as an administrative unit. And what we really did

02:17.348 --> 02:19.371
was pull together the teacher education programs 
from the three separate departments that existed

02:19.688 --> 02:30.466
at that time that had teacher education and 
created the College of Education. What we really

02:30.546 --> 02:43.468
had was, prior to 69, we had teacher education in 
the College of Engineering through industrial

02:30.546 --> 02:43.468
education, in the College of Agriculture in the 
Department of Agriculture Education. the

02:44.039 --> 02:52.551
Department of Education, which was in the College 
of Liberal Arts, along with the Department of

02:44.039 --> 02:52.551
Health and Physical Education, which was in the 
College of Liberal Arts. So we really had teacher

02:52.571 --> 02:57.238
education residing in four departments in three 
separate colleges. So it was under the leadership

02:58.280 --> 03:10.738
of Frank Hubert, who had great administrative 
insights, which we might want to discuss further,

02:58.280 --> 03:10.738
that pulled together the administrative unit of 
the College of Education and pulled all teacher

03:10.988 --> 03:25.072
education elements then under one 
administrative umbrella with agriculture

03:10.988 --> 03:25.072
education answering in a joint relationship to 
the College of Agriculture and the College of

03:10.988 --> 03:25.072
Education, which they still exist. So in 1969, 
when we created this College of Education, There

03:30.192 --> 03:46.093
were those of us who were involved in the teacher 
education function in the old Department of

03:30.192 --> 03:46.093
Industrial Education came to the College of 
Education with James Boone coming in as the head of

03:30.192 --> 03:46.093
the Department of Industrial Education at that 
time, Les Hawkins, who has since retired, and

03:30.192 --> 03:46.093
myself. There were as well as the faculty members 
who came to create the Department of Industrial

03:46.494 --> 03:56.607
Education within the College of Education. We 
brought with us the undergraduate teacher

03:57.088 --> 04:00.132
education program as well as the entire master's 
and doctoral level programs that were in

04:01.040 --> 04:06.387
existence. The doctor of education, which we had 
in the best education, was the first doctorate in

04:06.407 --> 04:15.660
the field of education that was on this campus. It 
preceded the development of the PhD in education

04:15.680 --> 04:23.050
by a number of years. I don't have the specifics, 
but it was in place prior to the The first

04:29.221 --> 04:31.083
doctorate, can you repeat that? The first 
doctorate was in industrial? In industrial

04:33.086 --> 04:34.207
education. And that program preceded the one in 
the Department of Education. That's the one that

04:40.135 --> 04:43.139
Dr. Barker was instrumental in putting together. 
The education one. The education doctorate.

04:45.602 --> 04:47.164
Well, the one in the Department of Education. Now, 
the one in the Department of Industrial

04:47.184 --> 04:52.991
Education, that was in the College of 
Engineering. Right. Dr. Barker was involved in

04:53.875 --> 04:58.599
that only to the degree of teaching courses and 
serving on committees. And who was responsible

04:58.619 --> 05:00.341
for that one? Within the College of Engineering, 
Dr. Chris Gronemann was the head of the department

05:00.781 --> 05:08.789
at the time that that doctoral program was 
started. And then Dr. Everett Glaesner kind of

05:09.550 --> 05:23.663
came in and coordinated that program until Dr. 
Gronemann retired, which was in 1967, which

05:09.550 --> 05:23.663
actually made the faculty position available 
that I filled at a lower level. Dr. Glaze may go on to

05:23.896 --> 05:26.499
the head of the department. Now,

05:27.379 --> 05:37.990
when we created the College of Education, prior to 
that, there were four different departments in

05:27.379 --> 05:37.990
three separate colleges. So then the old 
Department of Education was divided into three

05:38.010 --> 05:52.924
departments, being Educational Curriculum and 
Instruction, Educational Psychology, and

05:38.010 --> 05:52.924
Educational Administration.

05:53.495 --> 05:57.140
It was quite a change when we pulled all teacher 
education together. At the time we created the

05:57.901 --> 06:05.531
College of Education, I remember Frank Hubert 
introducing the faculty as the young faculty. And

06:05.631 --> 06:07.133
remember that's 18 years ago. And many of us who 
you're interviewing now, Glenn Johnson, Don

06:07.314 --> 06:16.586
Barker, various ones of us were younger then than 
we are now. But it was really a privileged be

06:20.461 --> 06:29.871
associated with the development and evolution of 
this new administrative unit, and the end of the

06:20.461 --> 06:29.871
dynamic leadership of Frank Hubert. But as he 
introduced this, and as he put together the

06:30.432 --> 06:48.612
faculty for this college, we look at the type of 
people that have been attracted to it, especially

06:30.432 --> 06:48.612
in the earlier time of the, not to detract from 
those now, but the earlier time when that's Glenn

06:30.432 --> 06:48.612
Johnson coming from the Ohio City University 
through

06:49.132 --> 07:13.758
Columbia, with Bob Schutz coming out of Stanford, 
with Hal Hawkins coming out of Harvard, with Jack

06:49.132 --> 07:13.758
Campbell is already here, but he's coming out of 
Columbia, coming to Teachers College of

06:49.132 --> 07:13.758
Columbia.

07:15.159 --> 07:16.941
What attracted all these people to A&M? Was it Dr. 
Hubert's himself, or was it the opportunity to get

07:19.658 --> 07:27.446
in on something that was just really new and 
starting, or what do you think? Well, I guess Lynn

07:27.466 --> 07:49.210
Johnson and I were here prior to the actual start of 
the college, so it was

07:27.466 --> 07:49.210
right at the time that Texas A&M, of course, was 
changing tremendously, and that we'd learned

07:27.466 --> 07:49.210
that there were such things as girls, and we were 
expanding, of course, it was interesting, I came

07:27.466 --> 07:49.210
here as a professor of college of engineering to 
have very few girls in classes, but to talk to

07:49.460 --> 08:10.978
people like Paul Hensarling, who was in the 
Department of Education and realized that we had a

07:49.460 --> 08:10.978
kindergarten endorsement at Texas A&M as one of 
the first ones in the state, even though we were

07:49.460 --> 08:10.978
traditionally an all-male institution, 
However, this kindergarten endorsement was

08:11.110 --> 08:14.653
primarily for summer school. What was an 
endorsement? Was that like something that they

08:15.835 --> 08:17.897
did? Well, rather than a degree of being 
elementary education, your certification in

08:17.917 --> 08:29.588
elementary is, but to teach kindergarten, it was 
an endorsement on an existing certificate. And so

08:30.669 --> 08:37.776
what we really had was a kindergarten endorsement 
so people would have their elementary

08:30.669 --> 08:37.776
certificates, and then they would get their 
kindergarten endorsement from us. and many of

08:38.009 --> 08:39.752
those were summer school courses. And those were 
for girls that were coming in, or late, or women?

08:42.516 --> 08:42.716
Okay. But it was interesting to be a traditionally 
male institution, one of the first kindergarten

08:42.736 --> 08:47.463
endorsements. I think, of course, that was before 
there was a college to educate. Right. I don't know

08:50.848 --> 08:55.655
if you picked up any place in your discussion, 
Sylvie, about this man, Frank Hubert. Not enough.

08:56.296 --> 08:58.839
I would be dealing with him later on. It was fun to 
hear a person who many, many people think about as a

08:58.859 --> 09:04.928
very... structured, very, well, the word cold has 
been used to describe Frank Hubert, and I guess

09:05.279 --> 09:16.616
those of us who knew him better would say he was a 
very warm human individual. In trying to build

09:17.557 --> 09:25.309
that a little bit, I'd like to share some personal 
things that I learned about working with him.

09:25.850 --> 09:34.763
First, Frank Hubert got his original 
baccalaureate degree from the University of

09:25.850 --> 09:34.763
Texas and went to Orange in political science, and 
then went to Orange as band teacher. And when he was

09:36.093 --> 09:50.309
in Orange, he tells a story about how he worked with 
the Bingo Bells, and the Bingo Bells was a drum and

09:36.093 --> 09:50.309
bugle corps in the mid-30s, which was kind of 
before the day of the drum and bugle corps for

09:36.093 --> 09:50.309
girls. But he really worked for Ledger Stark, who 
was a lumberman in the area, a Stark family. And he

09:57.698 --> 10:04.306
tells a story about performance-based teaching, 
performance-based employment. I'll tell you a

10:04.406 --> 10:05.627
story. song that Mr. Stark had heard over the 
radio, and he called Frank Hubert up and said,

10:05.962 --> 10:17.016
Frank, he said, I think we girls, he explained, he 
said, I'd like the girls to play that next week.

10:17.036 --> 10:21.763
Hubert called the radio station and found out that 
the name of the song was, Hey, That's Boogie

10:17.036 --> 10:21.763
Woogie. So this was right at the early Boogie 
Woogie time. He ended up, Mr. Stark had told Hubert

10:25.688 --> 10:33.158
that there was $100 in it for him if the girls had 
that to play the following week. So he got the radio

10:33.940 --> 10:46.518
station, found out where it was, finally got a hold 
of a copy of the music, arranged it for all of the

10:33.940 --> 10:46.518
ranks that they had in their music corps, and they 
played it the following week. He said, now that's

10:46.538 --> 10:48.942
performance based. But he tells us stories of 
working with that group, taking them to Soldier's

10:50.043 --> 11:03.002
Field in Chicago on a train that was air 
conditioned back at that time, and how the girls

11:04.754 --> 11:18.455
One girl had come from quite a lot of wealth in the 
Golden Triangle there of Beaumont, Orange area,

11:04.754 --> 11:18.455
where the other kids had come with brown paper 
sacks for their luggage for that trip. Mr. Stark

11:18.475 --> 11:21.199
saw that and said, that'll never happen again. So 
after that, when they traveled, each girl had

11:21.219 --> 11:31.654
their own piece of luggage with a companion 
overnight bag with all of the things that would go

11:21.219 --> 11:31.654
in it. And each of them traveled in white 
coveralls. And to hear Frank Hubert share this

11:34.606 --> 11:47.620
about wanting to meet the needs of economic 
deprived as well as economic well, gave me an

11:34.606 --> 11:47.620
insight into the man. Also, his dad was a medical 
doctor, and as he talked about going to the homes of

11:47.680 --> 11:58.892
people of lesser means and Frank talked about 
going to the homes of people with his dad for the

11:59.632 --> 12:16.413
delivery of children and so forth, and realizing 
the diversity in our population, the ethnic

11:59.632 --> 12:16.413
groups, and his dad was a doctor for all ethnic 
groups. And at that time in Texas history, that

12:16.773 --> 12:22.500
says something about the heritage of Frank. To 
finish off the Orange story, he went to Orange as a

12:23.261 --> 12:28.187
band teacher, then went back to Austin during the 
summers worked on his masters and then stayed at

12:28.555 --> 12:47.294
Orange as principal of the high school and went 
into World War II and came out of World War II and

12:28.555 --> 12:47.294
went to UT and got his doctorate and then worked at 
the Texas Education Agency for a number of years

12:28.555 --> 12:47.294
prior to going back to superintendent of schools 
in Orange. So all of his public school career was in

12:47.355 --> 12:53.601
Orange as first a teacher, then a principal, and 
then as a superintendent. realizing that he

12:54.374 --> 12:55.955
replaced J.W. Edgar when J.W. Edgar went to the 
Texas Education Agency as Commissioner of

12:56.836 --> 13:00.900
Education. That is when Frank Hubert went to 
Orange as superintendent of schools. It was from

13:06.004 --> 13:16.033
that background, sharing all of that background 
with a man, he then came to Texas A&M University

13:06.004 --> 13:16.033
when there were four administrative units.

13:17.555 --> 13:22.339
For clarity, let's call them colleges, but 
realize we were a Texas A&M college. But now, if we

13:22.876 --> 13:32.024
take about Texas University, the equivalent of, 
and he came as the Dean of Arts and Sciences. And you

13:32.044 --> 13:35.107
need to get him to talk about the evolution of all of 
this. I'm sharing a lot about him, but trying to

13:35.167 --> 13:38.911
share some of his warmth. So under his leadership, 
the College of Liberal Arts was divided into the

13:38.991 --> 13:48.099
College of Arts and the College of Science, or 
Liberal Arts and Science. And out of Liberal Arts

13:48.239 --> 13:51.482
also came the College of Business 
Administration. and now that also has been in the

13:51.918 --> 13:54.041
College of Education. He deemed in the College of 
Arts and Sciences, then in the College of Middle

13:54.121 --> 14:04.334
Arts, and then in the College of Education. So to 
deem in three separate colleges, but really he

14:04.755 --> 14:14.208
helped spawn those, which during a time of growth, 
he was a part of this growth here at Texas A&M

14:04.755 --> 14:14.208
University. At the time he interviewed Jim Boone 
and myself for positions of leadership in the new

14:14.268 --> 14:21.317
college.

14:22.512 --> 14:24.975
named Jim Boone, the head of the department in 
industrial ed. He asked me if I would serve as the

14:25.395 --> 14:33.885
then coordinator of research and development for 
the college of education, which the following

14:25.395 --> 14:33.885
year was then elevated to the associate dean for 
research and development. But his comment to us

14:34.706 --> 14:40.653
jokingly, but with sincerity, was, deans make 
mistakes. But he held his finger up and waved and he

14:41.994 --> 14:46.039
says, but they only have to live with them for one 
year. But then a twinkle in his eye that said, you

14:46.660 --> 14:55.697
know, I have faith in you, I have confidence in you, 
but this is not a tenured administrative

14:46.660 --> 14:55.697
position. And of course I was pleased to be able to 
serve as his associate dean up until the time of his

14:56.118 --> 15:04.855
retirement and then moving on forward into the 
working in the same position under the current

15:05.240 --> 15:09.046
dean. And also under Dean Lindbacher, that one. 
Under the interim dean. Yes, under the interim

15:13.332 --> 15:16.416
dean of Dean Lindbacher. And experiencing the 
administrative style of each of these three, I

15:16.436 --> 15:27.973
learned from each and gained professionally from 
each. I guess the one that I wanted to almost put on

15:28.325 --> 15:40.601
tape was to try to dispel any feelings that Frank 
Hubert was that cold administrator who made

15:28.325 --> 15:40.601
dictatorial decisions for the dean's office. 
Knowing him as I did, I feel he had great insights

15:40.942 --> 15:50.534
into the feeling for and of his faculty. He had a 
pipeline into the faculty that many faculty

15:51.496 --> 15:56.442
members did not. we're not aware of, I guess. It was 
an informal one, but he had great insights into

16:03.678 --> 16:15.897
their professional capabilities, their 
professional needs, as well as their personal

16:03.678 --> 16:15.897
needs and likes and dislikes. Do you think that 
because it was a much smaller group at the time, it

16:15.917 --> 16:28.437
was easier to do that than it would be, say, now when 
the faculty has tripled probably, or I don't know

16:15.917 --> 16:28.437
how much it has grown since he was here, but I'm 
hearing from other people that communication is

16:29.125 --> 16:42.906
okay, but it's strictly through the department 
head that there's not a whole lot of communication

16:29.125 --> 16:42.906
because it's just sometimes even within the one 
floor you don't know, you're not as able. It can't

16:42.926 --> 16:45.690
help, size can't help but impact on it. But there 
are those who could administer very large units

16:45.810 --> 16:53.401
and still have that feel for it. I think he had that 
quality, that insightfulness that was needed to

16:53.481 --> 16:57.968
do that. We didn't operate with a lot of formal 
committees, but yet there were appropriate

16:58.420 --> 17:16.835
committees, selected committees, and 
involvement of faculty in them, not to the degree

16:58.420 --> 17:16.835
that we have the committee structure in the 
university today. We're operating with the

17:16.895 --> 17:21.424
Faculty Senate today, which in the all of that 
speaks to more committee structure. But he

17:26.753 --> 17:31.923
operated with a... That's all overall college, 
not just the College of Education. That's the way

17:32.083 --> 17:33.706
it has to work now because of... In the total 
university, it's more committee structure. I

17:35.830 --> 17:36.191
see. But even within the College of Education, Our 
inquiry groups have certainly added some

17:39.190 --> 17:46.438
opportunities for faculty to feel a sense of 
input. If they didn't feel it before, they have the

17:46.458 --> 17:50.302
opportunity to feel that now. And perception is 
important. Right. Now, maybe that's something

17:52.224 --> 17:55.408
that I'm interested in finding out. Was the goal of 
the mission, in your opinion, or the goal or

17:56.389 --> 18:07.881
mission of the college, which is right now 
teaching research and service, has it changed in

17:56.389 --> 18:07.881
the proportion or in how much it is devoted to 
teaching or research now. I'm trying to divide

18:10.596 --> 18:20.565
this study into the Hubert era as such, because 
that was the beginnings, and then the present era,

18:10.596 --> 18:20.565
and then look into the future a little bit, maybe. 
But to what extent is that mission, do you feel,

18:20.585 --> 18:28.293
being fulfilled now versus how it was at the time? 
Is the emphasis the same, I guess, is what I'm

18:28.333 --> 18:31.455
wanting to know. The emphasis on teaching, I 
think, is not... any different now than it was

18:36.835 --> 18:38.502
then. I think we always must emphasize the 
teaching role in a university, and then use the

18:47.686 --> 18:50.770
research and service role as support to teaching. 
I realize that some colleges might look at it the

18:51.771 --> 18:57.578
other way around, but as a university, we have to 
look at it. We do have a job of teaching, but then

18:57.598 --> 19:04.627
teaching is enhanced with appropriate research 
and service activities. And I think that the

19:05.508 --> 19:12.276
emphasis on research is no different now than it 
was then. There were more opportunities in my

19:12.610 --> 19:18.357
particular field of industrial vocational 
education. There were more opportunities for

19:18.377 --> 19:25.366
research and service activities ten years ago 
than there are now because of the funding level.

19:26.588 --> 19:32.355
Which I want to come back and speak to the 
development of the interdisciplinary education

19:26.588 --> 19:32.355
program which I was deeply involved. And part of 
that was the result. The reason that evolved as it

19:34.397 --> 19:38.803
has is because of external funding. I think I would 
see our college grew in the earlier time because of

19:39.593 --> 19:49.344
external funding. We can name various faculty 
members, or faculty member lines at least, and

19:49.384 --> 20:03.660
even incumbents in those lines, that are here 
today because of external funding that allowed us

19:49.384 --> 20:03.660
to develop programs. And I don't see that 
happening today as much as I did then. Let's just

20:08.440 --> 20:10.646
tick them off a little bit. Community education 
was certainly one of the programs that evolved

20:10.766 --> 20:18.004
here because of major funding from the Mott 
Foundation. Hal Hawkins was instrumental in

20:18.305 --> 20:22.652
getting some of those funds. Bob Barrage was PMN as 
Director of the Center for Community Education

20:23.573 --> 20:31.946
and carried that role on for a number of years. But 
it was through the funding from the Mott

20:32.627 --> 20:45.848
Foundation that the line position for the Bob 
Barrage Professor line was established in the

20:32.627 --> 20:45.848
Education Administration. Well, that's a full 
tenure track line that someone else now carries,

20:46.216 --> 20:53.583
funded by the university. And then as the funds for 
Mott Foundation diminished or were redirected,

20:53.603 --> 21:01.550
that position for him was there. Taking other 
positions similar to that, when we created the Dr.

21:02.271 --> 21:14.842
Ponder, I believe him right now, he was the one who 
came in on soft money the first year he was here in

21:02.271 --> 21:14.842
health and physical education. He came in on There 
was funds from Baylor College of Medicine with the

21:15.747 --> 21:25.520
University of Houston to create a health 
administration program. And we got funds from the

21:25.540 --> 21:33.631
Kellogg Foundation to Baylor College of Medicine 
back to the University of Houston, Texas

21:25.540 --> 21:33.631
University. And it was through those funds that 
created this faculty position. And when we

21:38.838 --> 21:45.687
created it, we were in a growth situation, in a tax 
situation here in Texas, where we could make these

21:38.838 --> 21:45.687
commitments that we can't make. that we would, 
over a period of three years, absorb that position

21:46.055 --> 21:53.729
into the university budget. So as the program 
generated student credit hours, then we were able

21:53.749 --> 21:59.760
to build a faculty position with that. We can look 
at, in the industrial vocational education

22:00.010 --> 22:16.407
program, the position that Dr. Chris Borman 
originally came on was a soft money position under

22:00.010 --> 22:16.407
what we call the old EPDA, Professional Education 
and Professional Development Act, Section 553

22:00.010 --> 22:16.407
funds. These were, and they came through the 
state. So we had state funds coming to Texas A&M to

22:18.990 --> 22:25.056
assist in the development of a vocational 
guidance program. So when Dr. Borman came, he came

22:26.082 --> 22:34.575
as a professor, also wanting to help us develop a 
program in vocational guidance. As his, the next

22:34.595 --> 22:43.348
year that he became a full-time professor, a 
budgeted line in the Department of Education and

22:34.595 --> 22:43.348
Psychology, We retained that soft money for a 
couple of years, and I guess probably if we look at

22:43.615 --> 22:52.725
that position now, Jerry Capus is probably on that 
line, but has gone through four or five different

22:43.615 --> 22:52.725
people. But that original line item came as soft 
money. Soft money always refers to? To contract

22:58.090 --> 22:59.191
and grant activity. Okay. As we look at additional 
funds, it was in the vocational education

23:00.633 --> 23:06.059
division. We started our doctoral program in 
vocational education. with 25 fully funded

23:09.704 --> 23:13.137
doctoral fellows. I need to talk more about that 
era. But that also created a couple line items for

23:16.148 --> 23:20.625
people. We also created our adult education 
program through soft money. And that created line

23:25.444 --> 23:28.047
item. And then over time, evolved those into full 
tenure track positions. So several of the

23:35.979 --> 23:48.538
positions that are in the college now as tenure 
track faculty members or tenure track lines are

23:35.979 --> 23:48.538
ones that started through, quote, soft money. And 
of course, I was in such a. I'd say almost an Indian

23:51.149 --> 24:04.973
position, that I was back on it now, of being the one 
that coordinated getting these dollars and

23:51.149 --> 24:04.973
assisting these programs in their early 
evolutionary stages. It was a very rewarding

24:04.993 --> 24:09.501
period of time for me personally in doing this. I'm 
glad Frank Hubert saw in me to assist in doing that.

24:16.101 --> 24:25.712
Let me just talk about the adult ed program, 
interdisciplinary education program a little

24:16.101 --> 24:25.712
bit and see how it has evolved, because it's unique 
in all university campuses. Put it in the context

24:25.732 --> 24:34.122
of in 1969, when we created the College of 
Education, we had these six academic departments

24:25.732 --> 24:34.122
that we've already named. In February of 1970, 
there was a man by the name of superintendent of

24:34.883 --> 24:41.811
schools Dallas at the time. Sorry, I'm dropping 
the name.

24:49.168 --> 24:51.310
I'll have to pick that name back up. It came on our 
campus and made a presentation to a group of

24:51.330 --> 25:10.735
graduate students and faculty members that by 
1980, this is 1970 now, they would anticipate

24:51.330 --> 25:10.735
having more students enrolled in their adult and 
continuing education programs than they did at

24:51.330 --> 25:10.735
that time in their ongoing elementary and 
secondary programs. Now you think about that,

25:12.149 --> 25:14.973
that's a very horrible statement. So here I'd been 
appointed as a Associate Dean for Research and

25:14.993 --> 25:18.979
Development. I was just a coordinator at that 
time. I asked myself a question, what are we doing

25:22.565 --> 25:27.031
to prepare teachers to teach in that program? So 
the first major proposal that exited the College

25:27.712 --> 25:38.068
of Education after I was here was a proposal to 
Texas Kidney Agency to develop an adult education

25:27.712 --> 25:38.068
program. Now, so where within the structure I just 
described to you of the six departments, would you

25:41.748 --> 25:47.176
put an adult education program? It certainly is 
education psychology. Adult psychology is

25:48.878 --> 25:52.283
different than adolescent psychology, child 
psychology. It's certainly curriculum, but it's

25:52.824 --> 25:56.929
especially program administration. So we, and 
there's some other place to put it. The only adult

26:00.514 --> 26:04.600
education course we had on the books was on 
agriculture education. About the same time,

26:05.272 --> 26:17.623
there's a program called, and I've already 
referenced it, the Education Professions

26:05.272 --> 26:17.623
Development Act, the EPDA, had money in it for 
development of graduate programs of vocational

26:05.272 --> 26:17.623
education, comprehensive vocational 
education. So we had the Department of

26:18.304 --> 26:23.048
Agriculture Education and the Department of 
Industrial Education. But vocational education

26:23.169 --> 26:25.391
is certainly more than those two. So here we were to 
develop an administrative leadership program

26:26.111 --> 26:31.036
for vocational education. So where would we place 
it in our administrative structure? So what we

26:33.875 --> 26:37.619
did, we created a program called 
interdisciplinary education. And in that

26:38.379 --> 26:41.883
interdisciplinary education, we housed these 
two programs. One was considered to be a holding

26:41.903 --> 26:47.488
tank until they could do sprint off and do other 
things. But the interdisciplinary really

26:47.508 --> 26:51.953
evolved around where we got the faculty from. Here 
I was the coordinator in addition to my deans,

26:51.973 --> 26:59.200
subject deanship role, I was also a coordinator of 
interdisciplinary education. And I would pull

26:59.220 --> 27:01.502
faculty from each of the departments that needed, 
I needed to teach a course. If I needed a course in

27:06.788 --> 27:11.854
guidance, I'd go to Ed Psych and get the person. If I 
had a course in administration, vocational

27:11.874 --> 27:19.301
education, I'd go to industrial ed, I could go to ag 
ed. We'd have, we'd go to EBCI while sitting and

27:19.922 --> 27:24.047
teach someone. And we had all the flexibility to 
pull. And one of the nice things about this, I don't

27:25.909 --> 27:31.394
feel I ever got the leftovers of the faculty. I was 
able to always pull in the The main faculty were to

27:34.203 --> 27:36.626
teach that course. There was a good cooperative 
arrangement. But there was a shortcoming. Who was

27:40.432 --> 27:42.014
home to do the committee work?

27:45.418 --> 27:46.820
The student advisors and so forth. So finally we 
started putting some budget lines in that

27:47.121 --> 28:00.379
program, interdisciplinary education, to have a 
coordinator of adult education, a coordinator of

27:47.121 --> 28:00.379
adult extension, and a coordinator of vocational 
education. Then we started putting additional

28:01.321 --> 28:03.583
monies in there. So today, as we know the 
department now, it more or less operates as a

28:03.603 --> 28:11.630
department, even though it officially doesn't 
have departmental status. It's an institutional

28:11.650 --> 28:13.452
education program. It's not approved by the 
coordinating boards of the department. But for

28:15.774 --> 28:23.921
all practical purposes, we operate as a 
department, because it has its own inventory of

28:15.774 --> 28:23.921
courses, its own category of faculty, its own 
category of students.

28:25.723 --> 28:31.328
The members of that faculty are represented on our 
advisory committees in the college, on the policy

28:25.723 --> 28:31.328
committee. all functions of all the unique it is 
not a department so it's just and the other unique

28:31.949 --> 29:00.640
thing about it though is that before we operate 
around here on the subvention of money earned from

28:31.949 --> 29:00.640
student credit hours generated if I in EDCI if Jack 
Campbell earns student credit hours those are

28:31.949 --> 29:00.640
credited back to EDCI if I earn credit hours in 
industrial education, they're credited back to

29:00.923 --> 29:06.228
our department, industrial education. However, 
if I teach a course in interdisciplinary

29:06.248 --> 29:16.858
education, like I teach my grads course, those 
student credit hours are IDED. However, the

29:16.978 --> 29:23.043
subvention for those is credited back to the home 
department of where I have my academic

29:16.978 --> 29:23.043
appointment. And that was something that, again, 
was one that we evolved through in the creation of

29:23.063 --> 29:28.028
this IDED program. Another one, while I'm talking 
about the evolution of this adult education

29:28.430 --> 29:50.451
program, I was having coffee one Sunday morning 
with the then director of the Agriculture

29:28.430 --> 29:50.451
Extension Service, and he was somewhat bemoaning 
the fact that their extension personnel had a lot

29:28.430 --> 29:50.451
of good technical skills, but very few people 
skills. They had a degree in animal science, but

29:50.471 --> 29:58.318
the first job they had was a 4-H director working 
with two-legged people, two-legged animals. So I

29:59.058 --> 30:12.377
shared that with Frank Hubert Monday morning 
after I had gotten that from the director and we

29:59.058 --> 30:12.377
said why don't we add the word extension to that 
adult program. And so with a stroke of the pen we

30:12.997 --> 30:18.766
changed the word from adult education to adult and 
extension education. So our department, our

30:18.786 --> 30:27.698
adult ed program is adult and extension 
education, not by accident, but by planning that

30:18.786 --> 30:27.698
in, by coming talking with people in agriculture 
extension that wanted this people skills and then

30:27.948 --> 30:56.335
having the dean allowing that to be put in and so now 
that is in the college of education rather than the

30:27.948 --> 30:56.335
college of agriculture and it was a John Hutchison 
who was then say the director of agriculture

30:27.948 --> 30:56.335
extension service and I evolved this plan and Don 
Seaman's appointment in interdisciplinary

30:27.948 --> 30:56.335
education when he came his appointment was and 
really right up until almost last year was

30:56.737 --> 31:12.642
part-time in Ag College Extension Service and one 
of the secretaries in that program was funded by Ag

30:56.737 --> 31:12.642
College Extension Service all these years 
because we were wanting to prepare people to work

30:56.737 --> 31:12.642
in the Extension Service as well as the adult 
program. So that has been a link or a connection

31:12.983 --> 31:16.288
with the Extension. Is there anything that I can 
get where all of this is documented? because, of

31:21.172 --> 31:30.362
course, I get it from the transcript, but is there 
something, some document that this would all be

31:21.172 --> 31:30.362
chronicled in? Right. I'm afraid that...
