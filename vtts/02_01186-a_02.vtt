WEBVTT

00:02.798 --> 00:06.482
just starting when you came on board, et cetera? 
Well, when I came on board, we had great difficulty

00:06.502 --> 00:12.970
getting people, honest astronomers, to look at 
the planets. That changed when we had specific

00:14.232 --> 00:23.743
problems that were of interest to people, such as 
what is the actual surface pressure on Mars. I

00:24.398 --> 00:27.121
remember it when high spin rate came out with that 
number. That was a bombshell because they'd

00:27.161 --> 00:32.648
already started building probes for 85 millibar 
surface pressure. Right. So when we started to

00:33.990 --> 00:50.470
pique the interest of astronomers with some 
specific problems, the astronomers started to

00:33.990 --> 00:50.470
use the techniques, the technologies that had 
been developed in the interim to look at the

00:33.990 --> 00:50.470
planets. They had not, with the exception of a very 
few people. Bill Sinton and company did the

00:54.605 --> 00:58.811
infrared. They were doing spectra. Kuiper was 
doing some work. But there were a very limited

01:06.321 --> 01:08.744
number of people. But when the serious problem 
came along, and why did these astronomers pay

01:09.846 --> 01:17.236
attention to planetary problems? Because NASA 
said, we are going to send spacecraft. of planets.

01:23.354 --> 01:24.556
We were going to find out something. Planets 
became of greater interest to the public, to

01:25.677 --> 01:35.030
universities, and to the scientists. And what we 
did in those areas was simply to say, if we had a

01:35.050 --> 01:48.608
problem such as, let's say, the surface pressure 
on Mars, bring together people that we thought

01:35.050 --> 01:48.608
might

01:50.512 --> 01:56.678
have some idea of how to approach the problem, you 
know, bring them together in a big meeting. Money

01:56.858 --> 01:58.299
was no problem in those days. Say, here's the 
problem. Here's what they told us in the past. We

02:05.846 --> 02:07.427
just want you to think about the problem. What we 
need is this. And many of them went away and said,

02:11.351 --> 02:17.737
hey, I can think of a technique to give you that 
answer. And the surface pressure of Mars was a very

02:21.106 --> 02:26.135
good example of that problem.

02:27.758 --> 02:29.842
What do you think of the future of planetary 
astronomy? Is it going downhill?

02:38.037 --> 02:44.970
The answer to that is I think that the problems are 
becoming more difficult.

02:49.102 --> 03:10.412
I think that the type of problems that interest 
most astronomers

02:49.102 --> 03:10.412
are no longer relevant in the planetary area, but I 
think that there are many problems that interest

02:49.102 --> 03:10.412
related fields are becoming more important.

03:14.197 --> 03:19.024
For example, there are things associated with, 
let's volcanology on Io.

03:24.269 --> 03:25.410
They are becoming important. But most 
astronomers aren't interested in volcanology.

03:33.139 --> 03:46.716
I think that there are a large number of problems 
that can be worked on the planets that we didn't

03:33.139 --> 03:46.716
consider significant before because we didn't 
have the ground truth that has come as a result of

03:33.139 --> 03:46.716
the spacecraft. But now that we know what's 
actually happening on a planet, we can go back and

03:48.687 --> 03:59.041
learn how to interpret our telescopic 
observations. I think there's another area, and

04:01.024 --> 04:12.619
that is high-resolution imaging, 
high-resolution spectroscopy, primarily

04:01.024 --> 04:12.619
infrared.

04:15.215 --> 04:18.838
Because that's where the absorption bands of 
interest are. Are, yeah. I think that there are a

04:21.221 --> 04:26.346
lot of problems that are coming up that can be 
approached with new technologies.

04:28.728 --> 04:30.810
And we can do a lot of work on them. For example, if we 
can get reasonably high resolution images of a

04:31.230 --> 04:44.243
planet like Jupiter, there's a lot of meteorology

04:31.230 --> 04:44.243
that can be done. on Jupiter. In that line, I 
noticed that

04:47.573 --> 05:08.364
the CCD images they've taken of Mars really look 
like Mars does when you have a good telescope and a

04:47.573 --> 05:08.364
good sight and a good night and you see all this 
detail but was never able to photograph it because

04:47.573 --> 05:08.364
you couldn't beat the seeing in the old days. Can 
you get this variegated appearance which It looks

05:12.843 --> 05:20.292
kind of strangely familiar to me, but it's just 
another example on a very obvious level of look

05:12.843 --> 05:20.292
what we can see. You mentioned Jupiter with that 
sort of stuff, where before it all had to be visual

05:20.312 --> 05:27.019
because they couldn't photograph it. And the 
other thing is we didn't know what it was we were

05:28.201 --> 05:30.443
looking at. Things that they saw on the surface, 
for example, of Jupiter, that they didn't know

05:30.503 --> 05:40.875
whether they were optical illusions or something 
actually there. We know now, in many cases, there

05:41.210 --> 05:48.359
were features that were there, which we can use as 
tracers.

05:51.002 --> 05:59.353
But we are able to do things like three-tenths of an 
arc second at times with some of the telescopes,

05:51.002 --> 05:59.353
depending on the site. But with new 
instrumentation, we may be able to do that well on a

05:59.954 --> 06:06.682
continuous basis, if not even a little better than 
that. And if you can do that, there are a lot of

06:07.944 --> 06:10.727
problems that you can solve. There's been a lot of 
talk for the last ten or twenty years, as a matter of

06:12.243 --> 06:21.071
fact, about the practical importance of 
planetary astronomy, and the Earth is a planet.

06:24.073 --> 06:32.780
In the last couple of years, there's been a whole 
lot of attention, at least in the popular press, to

06:24.073 --> 06:32.780
killer asteroids and comets and things like that. 
Do you think that's overdone, or do you think that

06:33.441 --> 06:41.608
we ought to try and get every buck we can?

06:42.837 --> 06:51.108
Again, it's purely a subjective opinion 
question, but there's no objective way of

06:42.837 --> 06:51.108
answering it. No, I think that some of these things 
are important to study. I don't think, for

06:59.599 --> 07:08.170
example, killer asteroids, they say that the ones 
that are going to hit us and do some damage, we will

06:59.599 --> 07:08.170
never even see. And if you do see them, they'll be so 
close that you don't have any time to do anything

07:09.331 --> 07:13.997
about them. But like everything else, I don't know 
of any situation where more knowledge has hurt us.

07:25.912 --> 07:29.536
I know it gets a lot of popularity, some of these 
things. But I think that there is some good, valid,

07:30.437 --> 07:39.068
beneficial use that comes from studying some of 
this stuff. And the cost of studying it is

07:39.638 --> 07:44.903
negligible compared to the cost of a lot of other 
programs. My concern is this, that if there is a

07:44.923 --> 08:04.119
demise of planetary or solar system exploration 
with spacecraft, it's going to be very difficult

07:44.923 --> 08:04.119
to try to get the funds necessary to continue a 
significant program in planetary astronomy.

08:04.139 --> 08:05.160
That brings up a point. How much of an impact on 
funding do you think the fact that there is no

08:08.883 --> 08:13.969
evidence whatsoever of life on Mars as had?

08:24.240 --> 08:26.082
That's a difficult question to answer. Put it this 
way, if they would have found one organic

08:26.343 --> 08:30.628
molecule, do you think we would have had more 
probes? The answer to that is probably not that

08:32.390 --> 08:35.413
much different.

08:38.735 --> 08:46.222
I think we are still interested in pursuing 
examination of Mars for possible life forms. I

08:46.603 --> 08:55.872
think that

08:46.603 --> 08:55.872
maybe not the way we did it with the Viking mission, 
but I think that there is still an interest there.

08:56.292 --> 08:58.414
There certainly is an interest in Mars. Now, if 
this creature on Mars keeps devouring our

09:00.556 --> 09:07.223
spacecraft and we quit, we might find out 
something. That brings up a point. The loss of the

09:09.042 --> 09:15.650
Mars Observer, from what I could tell, came as 
quite a shock to a lot of the scientists and

09:09.042 --> 09:15.650
engineers involved. But we both go back far enough 
to remember the 60s when Ranger 1 through 6 failed,

09:16.651 --> 09:23.939
Mariner 1 failed. Do you think this was a useful, if 
you will, slap in the face at overconfident

09:23.959 --> 09:31.708
people?

09:37.139 --> 09:39.983
Maybe, yes, but I think it's also a danger. It's a 
very dangerous one. You know, we've often said,

09:42.827 --> 09:51.899
does success

09:42.827 --> 09:51.899
bring success, or does failure bring success? And 
by success, I mean the latter part of that is more

09:53.942 --> 09:58.187
money, more programs. If you have a successful 
program, there's a tendency by the powers that be

09:59.249 --> 10:05.998
that says, well, you've learned what you wanted to 
learn Let's turn our efforts to something else.

10:09.836 --> 10:21.950
And so when you have a failure, there's quite often 
the position that, gee, it's too bad, but we should

10:09.836 --> 10:21.950
really follow up. And we'll probably get another 
Mars mission for just that reason. It may have been

10:27.376 --> 10:35.125
harder if this mission had been successful to get 
another Mars mission than if this has been a

10:27.376 --> 10:35.125
failure. A good example of that is Space 
Telescope.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.082
So it's hard to say. I

10:46.122 --> 11:03.458
don't know, and this is sort of off the record, but 
some are now saying, hey, you better look at plans

10:46.122 --> 11:03.458
for another Mars observer or one that can do part of 
the the mission of Mars that Mars Observer was for.

11:08.106 --> 11:11.730
Nobody's canceled the Measure Pathfinder 
mission yet. We're still going ahead with Measure

11:13.011 --> 11:15.173
Network. So it hasn't brought an end to the 
program. The thing that concerns me is that at the

11:19.859 --> 11:32.753
time when a space program does come to an end, that 
the ground-based program, which is still capable

11:19.859 --> 11:32.753
of producing tremendous results is probably 
going to lose funding as well. And the

11:39.749 --> 11:43.834
ground-based stuff, of course, information 
comes much cheaper than anything. There's no

11:44.335 --> 11:46.217
comparison. Yes, that's one of the things I want to 
do. There's been endless books written about all

11:49.701 --> 11:57.490
the wonderful things that Viking and Voyager have 
done, but most of our information on the planets

11:49.701 --> 11:57.490
still comes from the ground. Would you agree?

12:02.534 --> 12:03.375
Not really. The information that we got from the 
spacecraft, you cannot get any other way than from

12:03.715 --> 12:12.887
the spacecraft.

12:15.390 --> 12:16.772
Which is the way it's supposed to be. Which is the 
way it is supposed to be. However, the fact that

12:19.756 --> 12:29.528
we've got all this good information from a 
spacecraft does not nullify the need for

12:19.756 --> 12:29.528
ground-based observations. And in fact, 
increases the value of ground based

12:31.373 --> 12:34.437
observations. I was

12:34.577 --> 12:45.431
just going to say that once you find out something 
from a spacecraft, you often find out that you

12:34.577 --> 12:45.431
don't really need a spacecraft. I'm thinking of 
the Great Dark Spot on Neptune. Now that we know

12:47.593 --> 12:51.238
it's there, people are looking at old visual 
drawings of Neptune and finding it. Oh, yes. Well,

12:55.795 --> 12:56.316
that's it. As soon as you know what the ground truth 
is, you don't necessarily have to keep repeating

12:56.596 --> 13:02.625
it. Now, it is true that we would like to know at 
greater resolution what the surface looks like,

13:04.067 --> 13:11.639
but Jupiter is an excellent example. We can study 
the motions in the Jovian atmosphere, features

13:12.780 --> 13:21.293
down to a certain size, quite well from the ground. 
And if you have something like the Space

13:22.049 --> 13:24.532
Telescope, extremely well. The volcanic 
activity on Io is studied not continuously, but on

13:26.374 --> 13:35.865
quite a continuous basis from the Earth. Look at 
comets. Now that we know what a comet looks like and

13:38.728 --> 13:48.900
how the emissions from a comet take place, we can 
learn a lot more about comets. from the ground than

13:49.808 --> 13:53.312
we were ever able to in the past. The same thing, I'm 
sure, is going to be true about asteroids. So the

14:00.241 --> 14:07.671
value of ground-based astronomy has not been 
diminished, but has been increased.

14:10.775 --> 14:12.457
Let me switch to a different topic. I've asked this 
because I was looking at this part of your records

14:12.858 --> 14:18.685
yesterday at at the NASA history office, and there 
was a big funding crunch in 73. I mean, your budget

14:25.167 --> 14:31.296
had been going up, and then slam-bang, it started 
to go down. What was that like? Well,

14:33.299 --> 14:47.440
it was disaster, of course, because many of the 
programs that were going along and growing had to

14:33.299 --> 14:47.440
be cut back. many less people were funded. At that 
time, we started our abortion, if you will, of

14:51.416 --> 14:59.810
planetary astronomers, and I never really 
recovered from that. So I'm trying to think of

15:01.853 --> 15:07.583
something that was specifically affected at that 
time. Me! Well, you was one thing. But we did have

15:10.848 --> 15:14.254
some very severe cutbacks in NASA. We had some 
severe cutbacks in what we could do. One of the

15:19.796 --> 15:30.653
things, for example, that we wanted to do when we 
built the IRTF is to equip it with the best

15:19.796 --> 15:30.653
instrumentation possible. Because of budget 
cuts, we had to stop building any instrumentation

15:31.474 --> 15:35.881
for it. What we're working with today is last 
decade's instrumentation. And it's very

15:45.267 --> 15:51.555
expensive to do it, because you're having to do 
stuff with the instrumentation that's not as

15:45.267 --> 15:51.555
good. It takes far longer to do the job. And it just 
is not satisfactory. It ends up by costing you much

15:57.483 --> 16:04.232
more money than it would if you could do it with 
today's technology.

16:08.077 --> 16:15.207
Based on your experience, do you think that NASA in 
general over-manages science, under-manages

16:08.077 --> 16:15.207
science? does it about right? From a personal 
point of view, I think it depends very much on the

16:18.856 --> 16:25.503
type of program. In the case of data analysis,

16:27.285 --> 16:33.011
I think we do it about right. People write 
proposals. The proposals are reviewed by their

16:37.196 --> 16:39.479
peers. We fund one of them we can. I think that there 
is some good work that we don't fund. I think

16:45.916 --> 16:58.692
there's also some poor work that gets proposed by 
good scientists and sometimes does get funded,

16:45.916 --> 16:58.692
but that's the way the dice comes up, you know. But I 
think that there are programs where we are trying

16:59.273 --> 17:15.012
to look for new things that money is wasted because 
the programs are not managed closely enough, and I

16:59.273 --> 17:15.012
don't think in these cases, that people are to 
blame. Many people go down the wrong path

17:18.234 --> 17:32.030
unknowingly

17:18.234 --> 17:32.030
because somebody isn't taking a look at it and 
saying, hey, wait a second, is that really the way

17:18.234 --> 17:32.030
you want to go? Not that they want to be directed,

17:33.091 --> 17:43.783
but I think we have to stay on top of and take an 
overview of many things in order to do it properly.

17:44.675 --> 17:53.267
I've heard a lot of comments that with flight 
missions in particular, NASA shows the pretty

17:44.675 --> 17:53.267
pictures and then chops off the data analysis. 
What do you think about that? We chop off the data

17:56.492 --> 18:00.117
analysis only when we cannot get any more money. We 
are just—I have been responsible for the NDAAP

18:02.320 --> 18:06.286
program. Which is? Neptune Data Analysis 
Program, and that's basically Voyager data

18:08.549 --> 18:12.775
analysis. We are now in our fourth year of that. And 
that is after the first year or two in which the

18:15.927 --> 18:20.252
investigators were supported. And that's being 
funded on the order of $3 million a year. Now, we

18:25.959 --> 18:33.889
would have liked to have funded it earlier for more 
money, let's say $5 million a year, $6 million a

18:25.959 --> 18:33.889
year, and done it. I think there's still a lot of 
good data that can be taken of it. I think that there

18:38.434 --> 18:40.336
are gaps. And what I mean by gaps is this. I 
personally have been heavily involved in the

18:44.733 --> 18:53.963
Voyager mission since I've been the Voyager 
program scientist for the Uranus and Neptune

18:44.733 --> 18:53.963
encounters.

18:57.888 --> 19:06.757
We can know a lot more about Jupiter and Saturn 
today because of material we have learned about

18:57.888 --> 19:06.757
Uranus and Neptune. We do not have a legitimate 
data analysis program on either Jupiter or

19:08.640 --> 19:13.525
Saturn. or on the outer planets as a whole. What we 
have a program for right now is to reduce the data

19:17.564 --> 19:23.249
that we got at Neptune.

19:27.093 --> 19:40.086
But as a scientist, you can understand that 
something we learned at Neptune, they say to

19:27.093 --> 19:40.086
somebody, hey, wait a second, if we do the same 
analysis on Uranus, we're going to get some very

19:40.336 --> 19:44.082
important information out about Uranus and about 
the other planets in general. We have to say to

19:45.003 --> 19:52.354
them, sorry, but unless you can tie it into 
Neptune, we can't support you under this program.

19:53.896 --> 20:06.715
So there are areas where I would say after the fact 
you might want to come back and take a new look at

19:53.896 --> 20:06.715
some old data and We have not always been able to do 
that because we just don't have the money and the

20:07.252 --> 20:13.158
programs. Yeah, interviewing myself when I was at 
headquarters, I really did run into the problem

20:13.378 --> 20:22.707
you did of having lots of money. In fact, that's 
where the original idea came from to build the

20:23.147 --> 20:36.600
telescopes at Texas and Hawaii was that I guess Bob 
Bryson and somebody else had like four million

20:23.147 --> 20:36.600
dollars that they couldn't spend. for like lunar 
geology. And of course, you don't want to turn

20:38.315 --> 20:40.598
money back. You've got to spend it. So Roger Moore 
found this out. And I went to Ernie Liddell, and he

20:43.662 --> 20:48.027
went to Orrin, and we said, look, we found a way to 
spend this money. And we couldn't get people to

20:48.468 --> 20:51.992
take the money, which is ridiculous. Pete Orrin's 
going to kill me for this, but I told him back in

20:53.694 --> 21:05.929
January that if he can do what he says he's going to 
do with Clementine for the amount of money,

20:53.694 --> 21:05.929
there's going to be hell to pay at NASA. The reason I 
bring this up is there's a lot of talk about they're

21:06.618 --> 21:10.864
going to dismantle NASA and so forth. And I don't 
know which side I'm on, because I worked for NASA. I

21:16.112 --> 21:23.523
worked at headquarters, but the Air Force paved my 
way through my PhD and supported me at Aerospace

21:16.112 --> 21:23.523
Corporation.

21:25.206 --> 21:26.628
Do you see any big changes? Again, this is 
subjective, but you're not working for the agency

21:27.429 --> 21:30.714
anymore. So I don't even know if it will be in the 
book, but I'm curious. One of the things that

21:35.896 --> 21:44.647
bothers me about Clementine is that everybody is 
touting it as to how wonderful a program you can do

21:35.896 --> 21:44.647
for a very little expense. I told Gordon, I said, 
you can't even build a flight-qualified

21:45.408 --> 21:50.514
spectrograph for $55 million. Okay. The 
difficulty is they don't realize all the money

21:52.236 --> 22:03.270
that's been spent bringing everything up to the 
status it has today to be put into Clementine. We

22:04.735 --> 22:12.783
could not start from scratch, like NASA has to do, 
and fly Clementine for the price that they're

22:04.735 --> 22:12.783
flying it for. It's the fact that there's millions 
and millions and millions, in fact, 100 million. I

22:17.768 --> 22:29.180
don't know how much into these specific 
instruments, but there's been a lot of money going

22:17.768 --> 22:29.180
into these things, which they're able to assemble 
relatively inexpensively and fly relatively

22:17.768 --> 22:29.180
inexpensively. And I think it's very misleading.

22:34.553 --> 22:36.215
Do you think NASA has a future?

22:40.619 --> 22:42.701
I think it has a very good future. Well, let me back 
off a moment. Does it have the potential for a

22:48.547 --> 22:50.529
future? The answer to that is yes. There are many 
very good things you can do in space, and you can do

22:55.354 --> 23:02.721
it relatively When I say relatively 
inexpensively, you don't have to spend $10

23:03.157 --> 23:06.882
billion a year. You might be able to get by for $4 
billion a year. You're not going to get by for $200

23:10.166 --> 23:13.330
million a year. On the other hand, is NASA going to 
survive by budget, off the budget, Congress? I

23:24.204 --> 23:24.645
don't know. I think it has some real serious 
problems there. From Fred Whipple and Gerard de

23:29.195 --> 23:44.050
Baccalaure on down, the opinion that I've gotten 
so far from, I don't know, at least 30 people on the

23:29.195 --> 23:44.050
record is that NASA money was absolutely crucial 
to the rebirth of modern planetary astronomy. Oh,

23:44.531 --> 23:45.251
absolutely. There's no question about it. It was 
planetary astronomy. In fact, it was very

23:49.255 --> 23:50.837
strange. Sitting in this desk, or not this desk, 
but the desk I had from 1964, I was planetary

23:50.877 --> 23:57.784
astronomy in the United States.

24:00.532 --> 24:03.355
It was a very small field then, wasn't it? You knew 
everybody. No, but it grew. And it's amazing to me

24:05.376 --> 24:11.202
today to meet people and say, hey, you are 
responsible. You are responsible for me being

24:11.582 --> 24:29.598
what I am today because it was the money that you 
gave in this grant to this institution that

24:11.582 --> 24:29.598
allowed me to have, you know, a postdoc or graduate 
student support or something else in planetary

24:11.582 --> 24:29.598
astronomy. And Not only that, but you realize that 
Hawaii, Texas, Arizona, there's a tremendous

24:29.928 --> 24:48.484
amount of research being done with instruments 
that NASA built. We didn't physically build them,

24:50.045 --> 24:56.871
but we provided the funds for them, and they've 
been very beneficial. I mean, it's absolutely

24:56.891 --> 24:59.833
amazing to me. The non-planetary infrared 
community complained bitterly about the IRTF.

25:08.992 --> 25:11.154
They still complain bitterly about the IRTF. 
Their complaint now is they don't get enough time

25:11.595 --> 25:13.718
on it. But for a long time, they complained 
bitterly because it was a waste of money as far as

25:16.381 --> 25:20.947
they could see. And while it might be useful for 
some planetary astronomers who didn't do decent

25:21.467 --> 25:29.938
science anyway, there was no good science could be 
done with that telescope. Gee, there was one other

25:31.792 --> 25:36.553
question I wanted to ask you.
