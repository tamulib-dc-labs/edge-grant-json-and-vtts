00:02.579 --> 00:11.709
This is an interview with Dr. Judith Baer by John 
Zaloom on May 1, 1991, at Bolton Hall, and it's

00:02.579 --> 00:11.709
concerning the student movement of the 60s.

00:14.513 --> 00:23.603
First, I want to ask how you would describe the 
situation of the students at Bryn Mawr when you

00:14.513 --> 00:23.603
were there as compared to how it may have been 
before that time and might have been after it. I

00:24.264 --> 00:25.806
think I have a very good perspective. I arrived 
there in 63. I took a year off. So I didn't graduate

00:29.377 --> 00:37.738
until 1968, and it seems to me to have changed 
extraordinarily in those times. And

00:38.099 --> 00:46.761
essentially, in 1963, you still had, now remember 
this was an elite women's college, You had very

00:47.213 --> 00:53.419
hardworking, very docile, very unquestioning 
students. And most of them were perfectly happy

00:53.439 --> 01:05.372
with the assumption that they would spend four 
years working like hell and be involved in the

00:53.439 --> 01:05.372
intellectual riches of an education there. And 
then they would get married and become suburban

01:05.472 --> 01:08.295
housewives. That was the mindset. Bryn Mawr has 
always graduated intellectuals. It has

01:16.332 --> 01:17.774
graduated professors. It graduated Katherine 
Hepburn, who certainly was not your typical 1930s

01:18.195 --> 01:23.565
housewife. It's always had room for brilliant 
eccentrics of that sort. But that was not the norm.

01:30.417 --> 01:33.682
You'd go to class, and the professor would 
lecture, and people would sit there. And I became

01:33.722 --> 01:38.010
famous in my philosophy class for raising 
questions. I don't think the professor minded

01:38.311 --> 01:45.324
because he was new, but I think the students really 
did because some people wouldn't even knit in

01:38.311 --> 01:45.324
class. The year before I went there, 
Mademoiselle, which at that time was running a

01:46.626 --> 01:58.227
series about colleges, had an article in Bryn 
Mawr, and they were talking about knitting in

01:46.626 --> 01:58.227
class, and they interviewed one English teacher 
who said, I always think I've succeeded in class if

01:58.763 --> 02:09.414
I've made it difficult for them to get through that 
complicated Swedish bit at the shoulder. That was

02:09.534 --> 02:10.916
about how it was. And then by the time 68 rolled 
around and I was graduating, I had changed my

02:10.976 --> 02:23.589
professional goals from law school to political 
science. I had this wonderful political science

02:24.310 --> 02:27.673
professor who was my the director of my honors 
thesis, and we had wonderful classes and always

02:27.923 --> 02:37.154
very disputatious, and he refused to teach the 
class in the usual lecture mode. We had student

02:37.895 --> 02:39.817
radicals all over the place. We had people who had 
been arrested in civil rights demonstrations who

02:39.837 --> 02:46.685
were active in SDS. The editor of the student 
newspaper the year I graduated was a radical and

02:52.882 --> 03:01.487
her roommate, who was a junior, was elected 
president of the Self-Government Association

02:52.882 --> 03:01.487
for the next year, which was amazing. Because for 
years, self-government's role had been to

03:02.069 --> 03:07.043
rubber-stamp the administration. I didn't know 
this until very recently, but there's a letter, an

03:07.462 --> 03:30.911
anonymous letter in the current issue of my alumni 
bulletin from a member of my original class, class

03:07.462 --> 03:30.911
of 67, who was kicked out, was expelled by the 
decision of the self-government honor board

03:07.462 --> 03:30.911
because she got married, and the reason she got 
married was that she was pregnant. Now, I mean,

03:30.951 --> 03:32.473
this is just amazing. now that anything like that 
could happen. But that's essentially what

03:35.180 --> 03:38.084
happened to her. And that certainly was not 
happening anymore. And the administration was

03:41.870 --> 03:46.416
very conservative, although they were... It was 
an interesting thing because Bryn Mawr was a

03:46.436 --> 03:57.853
college established by the Society of Friends, 
the Quakers, like Swarthmore and Haverford, who

03:46.436 --> 03:57.853
were its neighbors. And I never understood how the 
college had totally absorbed Quaker attitudes in

04:02.035 --> 04:10.309
terms of social behavior, which are very 
conservative. Quakers typically do not drink.

04:12.533 --> 04:16.379
They do not forbid it, but they tend to question it. 
We could not have liquor on campus. Quakers did

04:18.803 --> 04:24.533
not, at that time, approve of extramarital sex.

04:25.795 --> 04:31.683
were very limited in the number of hours that men 
could be in our rooms or that we could stay out

04:25.795 --> 04:31.683
overnight. We had sign-outs and we had hours that 
we had to be in, parietal hours and all of those

04:31.743 --> 04:38.933
things. I mean, there was no rule against sex 
because that was too difficult a subject to

04:39.834 --> 04:44.060
mention. It was the kind of thing that was 
considered bringing discredit on the college. So

04:48.126 --> 04:51.050
those ideas were absorbed from the Quakers. The 
Quaker tradition of activism was not. Activities

04:55.681 --> 05:08.618
like getting arrested for civil rights 
demonstrations or protesting against the war

04:55.681 --> 05:08.618
were not an honored part of the Bryn Mawr 
tradition, although they very much were an

04:55.681 --> 05:08.618
honored part of the Quaker tradition. And you had 
this administration that I think was composed of

05:09.038 --> 05:17.709
people that a hundred years before that would have 
been called blue stockings, women

05:09.038 --> 05:17.709
intellectuals. And they were very much in favor of 
deviating from the norm in terms of having a career

05:18.310 --> 05:24.338
and being a scholar. and you didn't have to get 
married and have kids. But they were not in favor of

05:27.092 --> 05:31.478
deviating from the norm in terms of social 
protest. That was a very frightening thing for

05:31.518 --> 05:34.562
them. And there was this kind of war between the 
administration and many of the students, and

05:34.603 --> 05:47.341
certainly the student leaders, which was going on 
during the year at the end of the time, 67 and 68,

05:34.603 --> 05:47.341
that I was there. OK. My next question you seem to 
have covered a little bit. I was going to ask if the

05:51.607 --> 05:54.291
phenomena in loco parentis was prevalent at Bryn 
Mawr. Oh, was it ever. And what the rules and

05:59.338 --> 06:01.080
regulations might have been. You seem to have 
covered a couple of them. Now, the rules and

06:02.483 --> 06:08.172
regulations were much more lenient than they were 
at most places. And, you know, we used to joke, you

06:08.192 --> 06:12.539
know, and in loco parentis means it means crazy 
like parents. But, for example, you could stay out

06:13.902 --> 06:19.671
until 1030 at night. without signing up. You could 
have an unlimited number of sign outs, and it was,

06:22.652 --> 06:46.097
let's see, it was 1230 on weekdays, 2 a.m. on 
weekends, and if you were going someplace, oh, for

06:22.652 --> 06:46.097
example, if you went to a play in Philadelphia, you 
could get a 130 sign out on weekends because you

06:22.652 --> 06:46.097
wouldn't be back. until that late. And you could, 
unless you got on probation, you could have as many

06:48.879 --> 06:57.323
of these as you wanted and you simply had to sign 
out, say, where you were going. For overnights,

07:01.282 --> 07:04.687
You could essentially go anywhere you wanted 
except to a guy's dorm. You could go to somebody's

07:05.548 --> 07:07.010
apartment. You could sign up as care of last name, 
1500 Broad Street, Philadelphia. They didn't

07:12.898 --> 07:14.560
care that it was your boyfriend. They wouldn't 
check up on you. That was perfectly all right. But

07:18.946 --> 07:20.288
you did have to sign up. They did have to know where 
you were, which I think now we would see a violation

07:20.308 --> 07:25.075
of privacy. As for parietal hours, as I recall, 
When I first got there, men could be in your rooms

07:29.615 --> 07:39.365
until 630, and then they could be in the public 
parts of the dormitories, the smokers, and so on.

07:39.945 --> 07:40.706
That was another thing. It was assumed that all 
adults smoked at that time, until 1030. And by the

07:45.250 --> 07:50.656
time I graduated, I think men could be in your rooms 
until 1030. So they had changed. And these,

07:51.977 --> 07:57.883
compared to what happened for most, not only for 
women's colleges, but for women, in coed colleges

07:57.863 --> 08:03.469
during the 60s, those were very, very liberal 
regulations. But they did exist, and they became a

08:03.849 --> 08:13.979
controversy, and eventually all sign outs were 
abolished. Now, as I recall, that didn't happen

08:14.099 --> 08:27.533
until I had left, but it was a really, it was a very, 
very passionately fought and controversial

08:14.099 --> 08:27.533
issue during the time I was there. Did you perceive 
that many other changes occurred during just the

08:28.087 --> 08:35.937
years that you were there in the rules and 
regulations? Yes. There were the changes and the

08:37.737 --> 08:46.566
relaxation on the way to abolition of the sign-out 
rules and parietal rules. And by the way, now they

08:46.606 --> 08:48.348
have co-ed dorms. The rules, the dress rules. For 
example, you had to wear skirts at classes. You had

08:53.793 --> 08:55.014
to wear skirts at dinner. All of that were changed. 
And I think the year after I graduated, they were

08:58.498 --> 09:02.142
totally abolished. Other than that, Most of the 
big changes came after I'd left. But there was

09:10.440 --> 09:15.925
certainly, I mean, it was clear by the time I 
graduated that the sign-outs were going to go. The

09:16.926 --> 09:18.808
parietal rules were going to go. They had already 
been considerably relaxed. As far as the student

09:23.332 --> 09:30.259
movement, first, if you might define it in your 
terms, what do you think the movement means? And

09:31.200 --> 09:34.543
secondly, tell me about when you became involved 
in it. Well, I think of the student movement as

09:35.198 --> 09:42.575
actually involving student power, issues of 
student governance. And I think that you'd have to

09:42.655 --> 09:49.230
say that it probably began, had begun, by 1968. And 
I certainly got involved in it Oh, well, earlier

09:52.597 --> 10:14.441
than that, I was involved in the time I got back from 
my year away, which was January of 1967, insofar as

09:52.597 --> 10:14.441
the movement was concentrated on changing pariah 
rules, dress rules, sign-out rules, all of those

09:52.597 --> 10:14.441
things, getting student governments over one's 
own life. Later on, the focus broadened very much.

10:19.146 --> 10:21.709
I mean, when I got to Chicago, As a graduate 
student, of course, I had all the freedom I wanted.

10:26.428 --> 10:29.171
Even the Graduate Women's Dormitory didn't have 
those rules. Then, all of a sudden, the issue was

10:29.672 --> 10:36.239
participating in faculty decision-making, 
which concerned you. And I was involved from the

10:37.020 --> 10:39.362
very beginning. My second quarter there, January 
of 1969, it was announced that a very popular

10:39.783 --> 10:50.515
radical feminist assistant professor in 
sociology, Marlene Dixon, would not be rehired.

10:50.731 --> 10:54.175
And the result of that was a student sit-in, was all 
kinds of things. Mrs. Dixon wasn't rehired. She

10:57.719 --> 11:02.285
got a year's reappointment, which she would not 
ordinarily have gotten. She went on to McGill

11:03.006 --> 11:04.908
University. And in fact, I really think I have to 
say that that part of the student movement failed.

11:12.037 --> 11:13.178
Students did not. win the power to participate in 
important decisions. Now, they do sit on

11:17.625 --> 11:27.880
committees in most universities, including A&M, 
but they do not have any voice in tenure decisions

11:17.625 --> 11:27.880
and hiring decisions. I think they should. I think 
they're an important constituency. My views on

11:30.764 --> 11:32.427
that have not changed. But students do not have 
that participation. It would seem that the only

11:34.931 --> 11:38.937
victory that has been gained is student 
evaluations. Well, big deal, yeah. You have an

11:40.319 --> 11:41.781
input. in terms of that. And by the way, most large 
universities like A&M, which are

11:44.495 --> 11:56.808
research-oriented, that's going to be a negative 
input rather than a positive input. People can get

11:57.328 --> 11:59.350
fired for bad teaching. They will not get kept on 
because of good teaching alone. Now, in the

12:05.277 --> 12:10.182
liberal arts colleges which emphasize teaching, 
that may not be true. But it is certainly true in the

12:10.651 --> 12:13.434
major universities. I have to say that the success 
of the student movement has been mixed as far as

12:14.555 --> 12:27.951
victory over sign-out hours, parietal hours, 
which didn't affect men anyway in most places, or

12:14.555 --> 12:27.951
didn't govern them. You have that as far as 
participation in academic governance.

12:33.657 --> 12:36.060
Governance, you don't have that to any meaningful 
extent.

12:39.083 --> 12:39.544
Was there a strong anti-war feeling at Bryn Mawr? 
Oh, boy. It was there ever. And Bryn Mawr went

12:46.790 --> 12:52.676
through the same metamorphosis that society did. 
By the beginning of, in the time that, 64, 65, the

12:52.857 --> 13:01.586
first years I was there, the anti-war sentiment 
was very much a minority on campus. You had a very

13:01.966 --> 13:08.653
large apathetic middle, and you had some people 
who supported the war essentially because they

13:01.966 --> 13:08.653
supported whatever The government did. I mean, 
this was what you had been brought up to do. And by

13:12.499 --> 13:19.625
the end of the 60s, the majority of the students 
were against the war. Absolutely. Now, they were

13:21.507 --> 13:24.530
against this particular war, the war in Vietnam. 
They were not pacifists, most of them. They were

13:27.012 --> 13:31.075
not necessarily advocates of a ban on nuclear 
testing. I don't think that issue came up. But

13:32.937 --> 13:37.881
certainly, the anti-Vietnam sentiment changed, 
as it did in the country. probably a little ahead of

13:38.097 --> 13:39.940
the other country. Were you first involved in the 
movement in general and then specifically more

13:42.024 --> 13:47.313
into the women's movement? I got involved through 
civil rights to anti-war to student to feminist

13:48.014 --> 13:57.410
and that was essentially my trajectory. There was 
no feminist, obvious, real, powerful, feminist

14:01.925 --> 14:08.333
presence at Bryn Mawr when I graduated. There 
would be in another couple of years, but not in

14:09.155 --> 14:11.978
1968. And, in fact, you really can say that the 
women's movement, you almost have to say, you can

14:12.960 --> 14:24.835
almost put a year to its beginning in that 68, 69. 
Now, obviously, there were four, there were for

14:29.465 --> 14:34.992
earlier impetuses like Betty Friedan's book, The 
Feminine Mystique, in 63. But it was amazing. When

14:37.795 --> 14:41.319
I left Bryn Mawr in 68, there was no feminist 
movement. All of a sudden, in Chicago, in 69, there

14:41.339 --> 14:45.024
was. And it was like that. It was incredible how 
fast this particular mobilization happened. Do

14:51.332 --> 14:56.498
you feel that that was because you went to Chicago 
or because it was the time period? I think it was the

14:56.518 --> 14:57.379
time period. Chicago was by no means unique, and by 
the time within two years that I had left Bryn Mawr

14:58.270 --> 15:16.237
in the fall of 1970, Kate Millett, who was the 
author of Feminist Politics, had been hired to

14:58.270 --> 15:16.237
teach a course there for one semester. That was how 
quickly this happened. How involved were you with

15:20.744 --> 15:27.754
the movement at Chicago as opposed to Bryn Mawr, 
and what types of demonstrations did you attend

15:20.744 --> 15:27.754
there? OK, do you mean the feminist movement or the 
student movement? Any aspect of it. OK. I think at

15:34.931 --> 15:44.861
the beginning I was just as much involved with 
student and peace movements generally, more with

15:34.931 --> 15:44.861
feminist movements, because of course there 
hadn't been any. By the end of the time I was at

15:46.323 --> 15:56.813
Chicago, which was 1974, less involved, partly 
because writing a dissertation is really

15:46.323 --> 15:56.813
something that you have to focus on, partly 
because there was less going on. Let's see, I've

16:00.851 --> 16:10.048
demonstrations, now I wasn't in the sit-in, but I 
attended a lot of the demonstrations which

16:00.851 --> 16:10.048
focused on the Marlene Dixon case in 1969. I 
attended the Chicago demonstrations which

16:14.984 --> 16:35.291
centered around Nixon's invasion of Cambodia or, 
as we now know, Nixon's announcement of what

16:14.984 --> 16:35.291
essentially was, you know, he'd been bombing 
Cambodia for quite a while in spring of 1970 and the

16:14.984 --> 16:35.291
murder of students at Kent State and Jackson 
State. There was also Let's see, I didn't go to any

16:38.778 --> 16:42.883
demonstrations in Washington after I moved to 
Chicago. So let's see, there was supportive

16:42.943 --> 16:46.348
demonstrations. There always are. If there's a 
big demonstration in Washington or New York,

16:47.930 --> 16:54.178
there are going to be supportive demonstrations 
in places like Chicago. There was the moratorium,

16:54.218 --> 17:06.253
the two moratoriums, October and November of 69, 
the big demonstration in May of 1971, echoing the

16:54.218 --> 17:06.253
demonstration in Washington Let's see. Oh, there 
was in April 5, 1969, there was a big march, I think

17:07.650 --> 17:15.001
nationwide demonstrations. I attended the one in 
Chicago. In the summer of 1970, August 26, which is

17:17.485 --> 17:30.306
the anniversary of the ratification of the 19th 
Amendment, there was a huge feminist

17:17.485 --> 17:30.306
demonstration all over the country. I attended 
the one in Chicago. And let's see. I think after

17:35.410 --> 17:37.974
1971 there wasn't much. That was really the kind of 
ending of demonstrations. I see. Since you

17:43.383 --> 17:54.961
finished your formal education in 1974, have you 
still been actively involved with the

17:43.383 --> 17:54.961
demonstrations or meetings dealing with women's 
equality in general or in which you specifically

17:43.383 --> 17:54.961
address the issue? Oh, yeah. I've made a memory now 
off and on. In fact, I'm officially a member of the

17:59.795 --> 18:02.560
Brazos County chapter, we just don't have much of a 
chapter. Now, actually, I've been an active NOW

18:03.081 --> 18:04.885
member. I've been a NOW member since 1976, 
National Organization for Women. I've been to

18:10.956 --> 18:12.799
pro-choice demonstrations. I remember 
particularly one in Los Angeles in March 1986

18:13.701 --> 18:19.592
because it was pouring rain. And then there was one 
in November of 89 at the Capitol in Austin. I was at

18:23.608 --> 18:24.309
that. So I continue to be involved, and I think as 
for many people, my involvement has taken a

18:24.690 --> 18:32.462
different kind of stance. There just aren't that 
many demonstrations anymore. But now I get

18:36.228 --> 18:44.821
involved, I think, more in my scholarship, which 
is feminist-oriented, than I do in local

18:36.228 --> 18:44.821
activism. With some people, there is more local 
activism. From your resume, it is apparent that a

18:48.243 --> 18:55.634
lot of your scholarship works deal with questions 
of equality under the law, especially for women.

18:55.654 --> 19:02.625
Do you feel that your interest in these types of 
issues stems from being a student in the late 1960s

18:55.654 --> 19:02.625
and early 70s? It goes back before that. I think 
that my student activism stems from my own

19:11.564 --> 19:14.088
consciousness of two things. I mean, now, we all 
have a family joke that I've been a feminist ever

19:14.188 --> 19:18.675
since I could read. And you've got to remember that 
we're talking the 50s, you know, June Cleaver, the

19:18.735 --> 19:25.325
feminine mystique. And this occurred to me as a 
life I did not want to live. And later on, no, I can

19:30.380 --> 19:39.829
remember the summer I was 10 making a decision that 
I did not want to grow up to live the life my mother

19:30.380 --> 19:39.829
did and the other women in our neighborhood. And it 
was quite a conscious decision. I didn't realize

19:41.731 --> 19:43.913
then that I needn't have worried. But there it was. 
And that was roughly the same time as the Civil

19:47.236 --> 19:58.767
Rights Movement was getting re-energized after 
the Brown decision. And I was very sympathetic to

19:59.253 --> 20:01.477
this. And both my own feminist consciousness, 
although we didn't really have that word then,

20:03.340 --> 20:16.783
except as an epithet, and my awareness of civil 
rights were what basically impelled me into the

20:03.340 --> 20:16.783
student movement. And that force also got me 
involved in the feminist movement and feminist

20:16.843 --> 20:22.813
writings. I think the way that I'm different from 
many 60s radicals, I don't know how many, but at

20:23.047 --> 20:32.116
least from the media prototype of the 60s radical, 
is that for me that has not changed. I haven't gone

20:32.877 --> 20:36.520
and voted for Reagan and joined the capitalist 
majority and all that. Many of them have. What do

20:39.984 --> 20:49.273
you feel are the legacies of the student movement 
in which you participated, and where does the

20:39.984 --> 20:49.273
issue of equality for women stand today? 
Certainly one legacy of the student movement is

20:49.642 --> 20:58.477
increased student control over their own lives. 
You don't realize how parental it was 25 or 30 years

20:58.958 --> 21:02.965
ago. Another legacy is

21:04.127 --> 21:12.882
the ability

21:14.093 --> 21:20.840
and the assumption of the right to question 
governmental decisions. I think we tend to forget

21:20.980 --> 21:35.414
that the vote in Congress on January 12th to get 
involved in the Gulf was a very mixed vote, and this

21:20.980 --> 21:35.414
is something that just did not happen in the early 
and middle years of the Vietnam War. I think we have

21:35.915 --> 21:42.902
forgotten this has all been buried in the euphoria 
after the victory, but we do see the assumption of a

21:43.237 --> 21:52.089
right on the part of individuals, on the part of 
other politicians, to question governmental

21:43.237 --> 21:52.089
decisions, particularly about war. I think 
you've got to see a legacy. The feminist legacy is

21:55.293 --> 21:58.898
very strong. You consider almost half of the 
medical students and law students in this country

21:58.978 --> 22:05.167
today are women. In graduate schools, the numbers 
are lower in most disciplines, but they're still a

22:05.247 --> 22:12.957
lot higher than they were 20 or 25 years ago. Very 
important gains have been won. There have been

22:20.381 --> 22:23.186
changes in laws. One important example is just the 
extraordinary changes in rape laws. The focus,

22:27.994 --> 22:34.405
with a few very bizarre cases, to the contrary, 
which get a lot of publicity, there is more focus on

22:34.385 --> 22:41.693
perpetrators and less focus on victims. There are 
changes in the way that graduate fellowships and

22:42.494 --> 22:49.042
things like that are awarded. There are changes in 
hiring. I mean, it used to be 30 years ago, a law firm

22:52.105 --> 23:01.436
or the State Department or an academic department 
could say, we don't hire women. If a woman took the

23:04.827 --> 23:09.993
oral examination in the State Department to 
become a foreign service officer 30 years ago. Her

23:10.033 --> 23:16.241
score, an automatic either 5 points or 10 points 
was deducted from her score just for being a woman.

23:16.481 --> 23:17.583
You don't see that anymore. I see a great deal that 
still needs to be done. There is the phenomenon of

23:24.371 --> 23:27.595
the glass ceiling. I mean, you see it if you compare 
the percentage of women associate professors at

23:27.635 --> 23:33.282
A&M to women full professors. You see it in 
business and law firms. Women don't seem to get

23:37.315 --> 23:39.978
promoted to the higher ranks. One thing that has 
not changed is women's hugely disproportionate

23:41.921 --> 23:52.735
share of family responsibilities for children, 
for housework, for parents as they age, and so on.

23:54.076 --> 23:57.841
We've all heard discussions about the mommy 
track, which is a very controversial proposal.

23:59.023 --> 24:04.770
But the whole idea, that couldn't even have 
happened except for the fact that There is this

24:05.138 --> 24:08.961
load of responsibility that women have that men 
don't. To achieve real equality, that's got to

24:09.422 --> 24:11.784
change. And I don't see that happening anytime 
soon. Do you feel like the future holds much

24:15.327 --> 24:23.734
positive for women's equality? Yes, I think there 
are positive prospects. Certainly you've got to

24:29.019 --> 24:31.461
say that there are gains. There are going to be 
women who eventually are going to move into top

24:34.838 --> 24:42.707
positions because of the fact that, well, just 
simply that not all women have families. And those

24:44.549 --> 24:47.753
that have children are having fewer children. 
Those that marry are marrying later and are more

24:47.793 --> 24:52.898
apt to get divorced. There are going to be women 
with lots of years left who are professional, with

24:52.938 --> 24:59.746
lots of time to devote to advancement. That's 
going to be positive. However, Economic

25:04.859 --> 25:07.564
recessions are very bad. We have one now. We're 
always going to have some. Women are going to tend

25:12.032 --> 25:18.684
to, in what were formerly male positions, are 
going to tend to be the last hired and the first

25:12.032 --> 25:18.684
fired. That's not only true in professional 
positions, in higher paying blue collar

25:18.724 --> 25:23.312
positions. One very positive sign is the Supreme 
Court's decision in Johnson Controls that you

25:25.767 --> 25:36.157
can't keep women out of positions because they're 
involved with chemicals likely to harm a fetus.

25:36.217 --> 25:39.420
And this was used against all women of 
childbearing age. And one company defined

25:39.480 --> 25:46.086
childbearing age as beginning at 5 and ending at 
63, if you can believe. That's a very positive

25:46.646 --> 25:52.872
decision, particularly for working class women. 
there is a possibility of eventually getting

25:53.763 --> 26:10.043
enacted the kind of bills that Bush has been 
vetoing, the family leave, the civil rights

25:53.763 --> 26:10.043
bills, the child care, all of those. Those will 
help women very much. I was reading today that

26:13.887 --> 26:15.990
you've In the New York Times article, you find 
people like Phyllis Schlafly, the old anti-ERA

26:16.291 --> 26:26.742
person, and Pat Schroeder in Congress on the same 
side in some of these issues, which is rather

26:16.291 --> 26:26.742
unusual. And if that is done, I see a lot in 
positive. If it is positive, however, what we have

26:33.508 --> 26:45.100
now and what we are likely to have in 92, the best 
possible solution is a stalemate of Republican

26:33.508 --> 26:45.100
president and Democratic Congress. It is 
possible that you're going to have one or both

26:45.468 --> 26:50.981
houses of Congress Republican. I don't think it's 
going to happen. It could. If that is true, the

26:54.569 --> 26:59.882
chances of change are even less. The big problem is 
you can do all you want with the government. There

27:04.646 --> 27:12.895
is not going to be equality until the behavior of 
individual men and women in families change. And

27:13.035 --> 27:15.117
that's something that's going to take 
generations. So if you give me 1,000 years to

27:15.698 --> 27:20.623
predict into the future, I'm optimistic. In the 
short run, I'm less so. Well, I really appreciate

27:24.327 --> 27:25.689
this interview. I enjoyed it. Thank you.
