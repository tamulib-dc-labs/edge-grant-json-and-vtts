WEBVTT

00:01.094 --> 00:23.271
your research on your own yeah okay now i i now have 
some questions i'd like to ask you concerning

00:01.094 --> 00:23.271
research on your own and that is attitudes towards 
it uh how much of your how much of your

00:01.094 --> 00:23.271
meteorological work applied to physical 
oceanography and vice versa did you immediately

00:01.094 --> 00:23.271
feel a kinship between the atmosphere and the 
ocean Yes. Actually, the equations were all

00:25.092 --> 00:40.986
developed by the same school of oceanography 
meteorologists in Scandinavia, so that all you

00:25.092 --> 00:40.986
had to do was change a sign here or there, and you 
studied exactly the same equations of motion.

00:42.267 --> 00:47.432
All I had to do was think upside down when I went into 
oceanography, and I had most of the theory. Now,

00:48.894 --> 00:53.798
most of the emphasis in your early work, at least on 
the first couple of papers I looked at, were in the

00:54.166 --> 00:56.528
area of applied sciences. Your first paper on wave 
data and your second one, of course, was on the

00:57.969 --> 01:06.017
application of VT and the pouring of underwater 
concrete. Did you always have this direction

01:06.337 --> 01:09.840
towards applied sciences when you began? Or was 
this the direction Scripps took you? Well, one of

01:13.083 --> 01:18.648
the jobs I had at Scripps, aside from the VT 
section, was in forecasting sea and swell. And I

01:18.688 --> 01:20.009
did that for quite a while. And that was just a 
natural outcome of that. The bridge engineers

01:23.343 --> 01:30.333
were building this bridge about four or five miles 
from our laboratory, and they were having trouble

01:23.343 --> 01:30.333
with concrete setting. And they wanted to know 
what in the world was wrong. And somehow, they

01:33.037 --> 01:41.029
hadn't been taught that the freezing point of 
seawater is below zero degrees centigrade. And if

01:41.350 --> 01:44.795
you have fresh water in your concrete, it'll 
freeze and spoil. So we said, all you have to do is

01:45.816 --> 01:47.759
put your BT down. You can tell what the temperature 
is and know when to pour. It was just an accident. So

01:52.098 --> 01:56.925
in both those cases, these things were just sort of 
natural evolutions of what you were working on in

01:52.098 --> 01:56.925
and around scripts. This is right. And did you work 
with Walter Munk there, by the way? I took classes

02:02.434 --> 02:05.478
with Walter, but I didn't work with him. Whenever I 
think of wave forecasting and so forth, I think of

02:05.518 --> 02:10.946
the work that the script was working on there. This 
is right. Actually, I did the wave forecasting

02:12.128 --> 02:15.954
under the direction of Sverdup himself. Oh, okay. 
And Sverdup worked with Munk in developing some of

02:16.435 --> 02:20.561
the improved techniques for forecasting. 
Mm-hmm. How did you miss Operation Crossroads, by

02:21.747 --> 02:26.632
the way? I don't know. Everybody I know went but me. 
I kept looking for your name on Operation

02:29.836 --> 02:31.958
Crossroads. I don't know. I've wondered about 
that all my life. I thought maybe I had already

02:36.584 --> 02:43.451
deduced that this had begun your interest in wave 
work before I got your Vita. Now...

02:50.873 --> 02:59.743
When you begin to deal with seawater, you know, as 
you move into your next series of papers, what led

02:50.873 --> 02:59.743
you there? Well, I don't know what papers we're 
talking about. I'm talking about your work with

03:03.847 --> 03:09.533
electro conductance of seawater. Well, I really 
perhaps should not have been listed as a co-author

03:09.553 --> 03:15.379
on these. I did not do a great deal of work. Okay. I 
think that that... I might better not have had my

03:20.793 --> 03:23.837
name on some of those papers. Okay, well, certain 
things I could see. Measuring upper level wind

03:25.198 --> 03:28.001
from a small ship, for example. That seemed to fit 
in the kind of category that I would have expected

03:28.061 --> 03:32.507
you to work in. Well, I started off with light, and 
my first main papers were all in light. Right. And

03:38.874 --> 03:44.621
then I came to Oregon State, and I had to get into 
some sort of oceanography, and the natural thing

03:38.874 --> 03:44.621
was to get into estuaries. So I have a number of 
papers on estuaries. Then I have some papers on

03:48.755 --> 03:57.747
intensity and frequency of storms and wave 
forecasting in the mid-Pacific. And this came

03:57.808 --> 04:02.594
about because I was a witness in a very large court 
case for the loss of a ship. Oh, really? And these

04:04.337 --> 04:09.984
were just direct outcomes of the results of the 
research work that I did for this court case. This

04:10.886 --> 04:14.010
was the loss of the Pennsylvania, which was lost 
with all hands in 1954. How? Tell me about it. Just

04:16.453 --> 04:17.715
an extremely bad storm. They had something like 18 
hours of waves over 20, 30 feet high, and it was just

04:19.197 --> 04:29.558
too much for the Soul Liberty ship, and it cracked 
in half, and that was the end of it. How would they

04:30.119 --> 04:31.662
call you in as a witness? Well, the ship was 
carrying a fairly expensive cargo vessel, for the

04:38.553 --> 04:39.414
Korean War. It was under charter to the U.S. And 
this cargo was lost, and it was insured both by the

04:39.434 --> 04:46.446
owners of the cargo and the owner of the ship. So the 
court case was to determine whether there was

04:46.466 --> 04:50.373
negligence on the part of the ship owner. And the 
lawyers for the ship owner felt that the bad

04:51.935 --> 04:58.106
weather should be classed as an act of God. If it's 
an act of God, then it's nobody's fault. Well, it

05:00.309 --> 05:01.371
turns out that The whole precedent in English law 
is that no storm, aside from a tropical hurricane,

05:02.363 --> 05:09.012
is an act of God. And this is the way it came out, and 
the owners lost. But what the lawyers were trying

05:12.036 --> 05:16.301
to do was build a case that this was one of the worst 
storms that had ever come up. And one outcome of

05:17.983 --> 05:23.891
that was the story, can mid-latitude storms be as 
severe as tropical typhoons and hurricanes? And I

05:23.911 --> 05:25.513
think in this paper in the U.S. Naval Institute 
Proceedings, I proved beyond a question of a doubt

05:25.593 --> 05:29.338
that there is bad or worse. Yeah. and yet ships are 
expected to go through those. Okay. I mean, I was

05:35.409 --> 05:39.354
looking at my list of your papers here, and this has 
got to be the one in 58, I suppose. Right. Well,

05:40.435 --> 05:49.427
but almost all the papers in 55 and 56 really are on 
light scattering and light effects. This is

05:49.447 --> 05:53.372
right, and this was sort of the ending of my thesis 
period. Okay. That's what I wanted to know. Right.

05:56.435 --> 06:00.180
I made a couple of trips on script ships after I got 
here and wrote, couple papers there, or one paper,

06:00.481 --> 06:04.807
Selective Transmission of Light in Tropical 
Pacific Waters. But then I turned over and the next

06:06.710 --> 06:12.759
batch are all on coastal oceanography. 
Absolutely. The next thing that you apply are

06:13.861 --> 06:19.930
really on estuary work with some work on water 
temperatures. I noticed you've done one on

06:20.431 --> 06:25.659
disposal of low-level radioactive waste in the 
Pacific coastal waters. This was a committee

06:26.239 --> 06:29.965
report, a committee by John Isaacs headed by John 
Isaacs, and we worked out, tried to come up with a

06:30.198 --> 06:42.636
solution for the problem, and I don't know 
whatever happened to the report because you never

06:30.198 --> 06:42.636
hear it referenced or anything. Okay, well, that 
was why I was so interested. I'd never heard of it

06:44.238 --> 06:52.930
before, and it just all of a sudden came at once and 
sort of appeared, particularly since your work in

06:44.238 --> 06:52.930
coastal waters around here. Well, I was on this 
National Academy committee for two or three years

06:54.472 --> 06:58.618
while this was being written. Are you optimistic 
about the disposal of nuclear waste and what have

06:59.375 --> 07:03.380
you in the ocean?

07:07.145 --> 07:12.472
Personally, I think it's perhaps the only 
solution in the long run, but most people won't

07:07.145 --> 07:12.472
agree with me. I think that the oceans are big 
enough that if it's properly diluted that we can

07:12.992 --> 07:17.498
get rid of some of it. If we don't get rid of it in the 
water mass itself, then I think we can bury it in

07:18.039 --> 07:24.387
sediments. The idea of burying it on land just 
horrifies me. You're pumping it down into

07:27.487 --> 07:29.049
aquifers. So I take it from that, and with all the 
work you've done along the coastal zone, is that

07:31.373 --> 07:44.431
possibly you don't consider the ocean in such a 
danger of pollution as one might be led to believe.

07:46.835 --> 07:54.205
Well, I'm sure that it's badly polluted near large 
ports and near large sewer outfalls. But I think

07:54.742 --> 08:07.298
the open ocean, aside from certain persistent 
chemicals used in agriculture, I think it has a

07:54.742 --> 08:07.298
tremendous ability or resiliency to pollution. 
Okay. I certainly don't want to put words in your

08:08.981 --> 08:17.672
mouth, but do you see the oceans then as an 
extension of man's life on Earth? That is, is that

08:17.932 --> 08:19.975
their primary purpose? No. Okay. I think that as we 
get more and more people on land and as our natural

08:25.859 --> 08:33.749
resources are depleted, we're just going to have 
to move out into the oceans to get more and more

08:25.859 --> 08:33.749
material. With your work on estuaries and what 
have you, are you optimistic about mariculture or

08:35.151 --> 08:39.856
aquaculture? I think it's strictly a matter of 
cost. As things get more and more expensive, we'll

08:42.480 --> 08:45.283
do more and more of these things. This is showing up 
in Japan. They have a lot of aquaculture going on

08:48.087 --> 08:50.409
there. It's just a matter of cost, what we're 
willing to pay and what we can pay.

08:57.095 --> 08:59.537
What about mining from the sea, as long as I have you 
on that topic?

09:03.201 --> 09:05.923
I think it's inevitable that we're going to begin 
mining more and more. The nodules will be first,

09:06.784 --> 09:10.167
and eventually we're going to have hard rock 
mining. I don't see any other solution. So you do

09:12.189 --> 09:20.377
see, then, us turning more and more to the sea, I 
suppose, for both food and mining materials.

09:20.397 --> 09:26.342
Well, in 1957, during the IGY, oceans just all of a 
sudden received all kinds of funding partially

09:26.947 --> 09:30.071
because the ocean was going to feed the teeming 
millions. That idea seems to have fallen into some

09:30.652 --> 09:33.696
disregard. I think the idea of feeding the teeming 
millions perhaps is not as good as it should be. I

09:46.253 --> 09:48.997
don't really think there's that much material 
present. If we're willing to lower the trophic

09:49.057 --> 09:55.165
levels and can eat plankton in some way, then I 
think we can feed many more people I think of

09:55.938 --> 10:03.709
aquaculture or mariculture as being a source of 
crabs and oysters and delicacies that are

09:55.938 --> 10:03.709
high-priced things. Okay, then you see it more as 
gourmet food, if I may say that. Gourmet food,

10:07.514 --> 10:08.115
right. What about you guys doing some work up and 
down? Well, not you guys, because that's wrong,

10:11.920 --> 10:19.110
but the marine fisheries are doing work up and down 
the coast with ranching and salmon, for example. I

10:19.765 --> 10:22.829
think this is a fine idea, but salmon is certainly a 
gourmet luxury. It's $3.80 a pound in the market.

10:25.191 --> 10:29.136
You don't see for dropping to a dollar a nickel a 
pound like hamburger meat or anything. No, sir.

10:29.456 --> 10:30.517
Okay, unfortunately. I was afraid you were going 
to answer that way. No. All right, now, when I have,

10:32.720 --> 10:42.311
after you, working in predictive water 
temperatures, you know, beginning in 64, it's

10:32.720 --> 10:42.311
only Oregon and Coast. I might talk a little bit 
about predictive water temperatures if you don't

10:43.593 --> 10:46.616
mind. Okay, sure. I want you to talk about what you 
want to talk about. In about 1956 or 57, I was still

10:48.925 --> 10:57.139
getting only $10,000 a year from ONR, and I 
couldn't expand in any way. So I talked the Fish and

10:57.479 --> 11:05.232
Wildlife Service into a contract, I think it was 
for $10,000, to predict water temperatures in

10:57.479 --> 11:05.232
reservoirs. And this had been done rudimentarily 
by several people in the past, but I developed a

11:05.532 --> 11:10.140
system. under this contract. And then I went on to 
have a private consulting firm called Water

11:13.480 --> 11:17.748
Research Associates. And over a period of 10 
years, I made 30 studies of dams and reservoirs

11:18.088 --> 11:33.917
from Alaska to Southern California for all sorts 
of agencies and predicted before the dams were

11:18.088 --> 11:33.917
built what the temperature structure would be 
downstream. And this is a combination of

11:34.471 --> 11:37.155
oceanography, meteorology, and limnology. 
Limnology, right. Now, this is much broader than

11:38.737 --> 11:40.720
I'd anticipate. I had some questions on... 
Straightened two sets of teeth, took my family to

11:40.820 --> 11:47.830
Europe, put all three kids through college. Oh, 
that's excellent. That's excellent. I had

11:52.177 --> 11:59.968
several questions about temperature that I had 
jotted down here, but I want to know something else

11:52.177 --> 11:59.968
differently now that you're talking that way. 
Limnology. How did you become interested in it?

12:04.552 --> 12:06.815
Did you just see the potential for measuring these 
temperatures? Well, I was casting about for

12:06.915 --> 12:17.929
something to do to make myself somewhat 
indispensable at Oregon State, and they didn't

12:06.915 --> 12:17.929
have any courses in physical limnology, so I 
started teaching physical limnology, and this is

12:06.915 --> 12:17.929
how I started. Okay, and did you find it extremely 
difficult to make any transfer? Did it seem to fit

12:24.037 --> 12:26.901
in well already with your work of atmosphere and 
ocean? I think it was a natural transfer. There was

12:29.584 --> 12:31.967
no problem. Actually, the few reservoirs that 
were built, it turned out the forecasts were

12:32.335 --> 12:38.203
reasonably good, and everybody seemed to be quite 
happy with them. Do you still do this? No. After I

12:40.466 --> 12:54.684
had the system going, and business was pretty 
good, two or three engineering firms set up their

12:40.466 --> 12:54.684
own system and copied my forecasts and took it away 
from me. They were working full-time on it, so that

12:54.704 --> 12:57.427
was the end of it. No part-time work. Then after 
that, what do you move into? Well, I began to do,

13:02.913 --> 13:31.300
when I started research again, I cast about for a 
subject that wasn't being covered that I thought

13:02.913 --> 13:31.300
might be important, and it turns out that air-sea 
interaction was becoming very important at that

13:02.913 --> 13:31.300
time, and it was concentrated really on two 
scales, and one scale was what you might call the

13:02.913 --> 13:31.300
meter scale, micrometeorology over the oceans, 
and there was a lot of work done on that, and then it

13:02.913 --> 13:31.300
jumped to synoptic scale, several thousand 
kilometers, and there was very little mesoscale

13:31.550 --> 13:37.400
work being done. So I thought, well, I'll study 
mesoscale meteorology over the oceans, and this

13:37.680 --> 13:43.750
is what I've been working in since. And what sort of 
work have you been doing? Well, there have been a

13:46.475 --> 13:55.650
number of large-scale international air-sea 
interaction studies, and I have taken part in

13:56.440 --> 14:21.334
several of these and have studied the mesoscale 
primarily the mesoscale distribution of winds

13:56.440 --> 14:21.334
over the ocean surface

13:56.440 --> 14:21.334
variability organization in the variability 
these studies have been the jason british jason

13:56.440 --> 14:21.334
expedition in 1972 the german john swap 
expedition in the north sea in 1973 The Japanese

14:22.124 --> 14:28.492
Amtech study in 75, and this September I'll take 
part in the British Jason 77, the next year Jason

14:22.124 --> 14:28.492
78. In 79 I hope to take part in a Somali current 
study. So that each time I join these large

14:34.580 --> 14:43.631
organizations, simply to get the logistic 
support and to be able to furnish data which other

14:34.580 --> 14:43.631
people need. One of the most interesting studies 
has to do with mesoscale organized confections.

14:51.588 --> 15:04.564
If you get a high enough air-sea interaction 
difference, you'll find that there are cells

14:51.588 --> 15:04.564
formed which are the order of 30 to 50 kilometers 
across, which act almost identical to large

14:51.588 --> 15:04.564
cumulus clouds. And during the AMTEC study, I set 
up some buoys between Korea and Okinawa

15:05.686 --> 15:18.962
and measured the characteristics of these cells 
as they moved across the buoy array. I could tell

15:19.516 --> 15:31.474
where the air was coming down, where it was colder 
and drier, coming around the edges of the cells,

15:19.516 --> 15:31.474
how it warmed up underneath the cells as the water 
passed over the warm ocean waters, and so on.

15:35.280 --> 15:36.982
Now, are you working with satellites?

15:39.346 --> 15:46.857
No, I use satellites photos because they'll tell 
you, you can look at them and see these individual

15:39.346 --> 15:46.857
cells and get their size and how they change. It 
seemed to me for a while, and partially because of

15:47.191 --> 16:05.669
the work that was going on in terms of waves, wave 
currents,

15:47.191 --> 16:05.669
that for physical oceanography, satellites and 
buoys were the wave of the future, if I may use that

15:47.191 --> 16:05.669
pun. That this was what was going to redo physical 
oceanography, which is going to make physical

16:05.689 --> 16:15.358
oceanography again sort of the Enfield it had once 
been but was no longer. Well, I think everybody

16:15.811 --> 16:17.794
felt this was true. But the buoys have not really 
panned out. We've taken a sort of a jump toward,

16:20.959 --> 16:40.328
well, the popular thing now, aside from 
satellites, are various and sundry towed

16:20.959 --> 16:40.328
instruments, or free fall instruments, that give 
you an in situ measurement of currents, salinity,

16:20.959 --> 16:40.328
temperature. And there are all kinds of these fish 
that are towed.

16:48.515 --> 16:53.970
do all sorts of high-speed physical oceanography 
that seems to be the wave of the future right now.

16:54.752 --> 16:58.963
What kind of data do you get from those? Well...

17:05.238 --> 17:24.607
Most of them have concentrated on fine structure 
in the currents, and in fine structure in

17:05.238 --> 17:24.607
temperature, fine structure in salinity, 
various and sundry types of waves, internal waves

17:05.238 --> 17:24.607
that occur in the oceans, identifying them, 
measuring their scale, speed, and so on. Now, I

17:27.292 --> 17:34.182
noticed in 1967, weather and solar radiation. 
that a paper on, was this leading towards this,

17:34.803 --> 17:43.534
your work on solar radiation, was this leading 
towards production of energy? No. No, okay. No,

17:45.337 --> 17:52.566
I'm just interested, it's a source of heat that 
goes into the oceans, which then is given back to

17:45.337 --> 17:52.566
run the atmosphere. Okay, so still, best I can tell 
you that the second one, incoming solar

17:52.726 --> 17:58.153
radiation, dealt with light, is that? Where are we 
now? On 68, incoming solar radiation right here

18:00.116 --> 18:03.240
over the tropical ocean? in nature. That seemed to 
me like that was dealing with light rather than,

18:04.240 --> 18:08.146
you know. No, this is heat. And heat, okay. Our sole 
interest was heat. Then that would fit in nicely

18:12.212 --> 18:18.060
then with the rest of the things you're doing, 
which involves heat on down through 69 and so

18:12.212 --> 18:18.060
forth. Right. Okay. All right. I just wanted to 
make sure that you hadn't slipped the paper in on me

18:19.423 --> 18:23.168
that I didn't recognize along the way. No. On these 
international voyages, how cooperative were the

18:26.072 --> 18:29.838
other international oceanographers? Well, I In 
almost every case, I've found that they're

18:33.899 --> 18:36.622
extremely cooperative. They appreciate the 
assistance that you're able to give them, and they

18:36.662 --> 18:41.527
give you assistance in turn. For example, I had 
been having trouble getting a ship to use in 1968

18:41.567 --> 18:56.343
for the British Jason expedition, and the Germans 
came on and volunteered six days of ship duty, ship

18:41.567 --> 18:56.343
time, without cost if I needed it. It turns out that 
I will use the Woods Hole ship instead. All right. I

19:01.051 --> 19:09.523
hate to ask you to make invidious comparisons, but 
what would you say about oceanography in other

19:01.051 --> 19:09.523
countries as compared to oceanography in our own? 
Are there any countries who are particularly

19:09.543 --> 19:13.088
ahead of us in the science of oceanography, behind 
us? I think as far as sheer volume is concerned that

19:13.809 --> 19:19.237
the Russians are considerably ahead of us. But 
their quality appears, from what I can see, to be

19:20.159 --> 19:23.544
spotty. They have some extremely fine 
theoreticians, they have some good practical

19:23.584 --> 19:30.113
people, but in general they have a lot of 
pedestrian work done too. Any comments on anyone

19:31.358 --> 19:33.340
else you'd like to? Well, I think the quality of 
research in England and Germany, particularly

19:34.221 --> 19:45.392
Germany, is very high but they do not have very 
extensive programs compared to the U.S. I've

19:47.995 --> 19:56.944
worked with the Germans considerably and I find 
them very sharp people and just as good as any we

19:47.995 --> 19:56.944
have in this country. But you think it's just a 
matter of volume in those cases? I think it's more a

20:00.378 --> 20:01.500
matter of volume. I

20:02.402 --> 20:09.133
want to return to your work here in a second, but I 
want to ask you one more question here. Do you see

20:09.153 --> 20:16.806
with current international restrictions 
developing, As an oceanographer, your work being

20:17.309 --> 20:22.354
pushed back closer and closer all the time to the 
shore? I think this can happen, and I'm hoping it

20:23.075 --> 20:25.878
won't happen. And I know that a number of 
laboratories in this country are working

20:26.338 --> 20:38.831
feverishly to sort of clear the way in the future to 
work with various countries by bending over

20:26.338 --> 20:38.831
backwards trying to help them. And I think this is 
about the only way we're going to do it. If we're a

20:41.794 --> 20:44.937
source of help and encouragement, to a less 
developed country, I think we'll be more welcome

20:45.490 --> 20:49.674
than if we're arrogant. Okay, so you think it is 
going to be possible as a scientist, perhaps, to

20:49.694 --> 20:54.720
work with the 200 mile limits? Well, we have to work 
with them. Yeah, that's true. Oregon State, we're

20:59.164 --> 21:02.948
not the only school that's done this, but I 
followed what we've done. About 10 years ago, I

21:03.028 --> 21:08.995
started cooperative work with various West Coast 
South American countries. We visit them whenever

21:09.055 --> 21:11.397
we can. have encouraged their students to come. 
We've tailored the coursework to their

21:13.329 --> 21:17.135
background rather than to a standard background. 
We have 15 Latinos enrolled at the present time,

21:17.715 --> 21:23.924
which is more, I think, than anybody else in the 
country. We concentrate on Mexico down to Chile.

21:29.672 --> 21:31.695
We've sent people down to Chile to teach. Several 
people have gone there.

21:37.262 --> 21:40.607
We've done cooperative work aboard Mexican 
ships. two large cooperative studies with the

21:40.992 --> 21:43.616
Mexican Navy. My new student in the fall will be 
from Costa Rica. We already have one from Costa

21:48.464 --> 21:50.046
Rica. So that we really have bent over backwards to 
develop the Western tier, because this is where we

21:52.510 --> 21:59.200
want to work in the future. And I think it's good for 
both sides. I had no idea you'd done all that. When

22:04.468 --> 22:07.573
did you make a decision deliberately to recruit 
students? About 10 years ago. About 10 years ago.

22:09.991 --> 22:11.172
Was it sort of accidental? Did you think you need 
contacts in that country or you just? Well, I

22:15.456 --> 22:21.221
was fortunate and got a prize, $1,000. And my wife 
in a weak moment said I could do what I wanted with

22:21.321 --> 22:24.244
it. Oh, okay. So I was going to meet a script ship, I 
think it was in Panama, and I just took a month off

22:25.285 --> 22:35.514
and spent my $1,000 traveling all over all the labs 
in South America and got acquainted with people

22:25.285 --> 22:35.514
and set the groundwork. Okay, good. What did you 
get the prize for? Pardon? What did the prize come

22:38.410 --> 22:39.732
for? Distinguished professor thing, something. 
Okay, here at Oregon State? Yeah. Oh, that's

22:43.675 --> 22:45.037
excellent, excellent. Now, in terms of just 
surveying your research, we'd only really got

22:45.537 --> 22:50.342
until about 1969, okay? What would you like to 
mention in this period and through here of

22:52.184 --> 22:58.650
particular significant accomplishments, you 
think?

23:03.034 --> 23:03.835
Oh, goodness.

23:07.477 --> 23:10.420
Well, I worked with Bill Quinn on a number of 
things. He was the primary investigator, and I had

23:10.701 --> 23:15.967
a lot of rap sessions with him. And there was some, I 
think, fairly important work came out of this.

23:20.652 --> 23:27.820
Now, Bill Quinn has changed from working on the 
heat budget of the tropics to the prediction of El

23:20.652 --> 23:27.820
Nino. And I've not done any of that work with him. It 
was about that time then that I began to do more and

23:30.203 --> 23:36.330
more air-sea interaction work. OK. In 1972, I 
changed over full time to research the NRC

23:37.632 --> 23:45.384
interaction. I have one other thing to ask before 
we get to 1972.

23:52.396 --> 24:00.248
A conference on the interaction of sea and 
atmosphere, is that the move that makes the change

23:52.396 --> 24:00.248
for you?

24:03.502 --> 24:07.948
About 1971, as I said before, I cast about, where 
was there a hole? There was a hole, and that's how I

24:08.509 --> 24:10.511
got started. Now that conference, that was just a 
report on a meeting, the first big air-sea

24:10.932 --> 24:20.425
interaction meeting that the American 
Meteorological Society set up.

24:25.051 --> 24:30.538
And incidentally, I got up after having the flu to 
go, I was chairman of one of the sessions, and I

24:31.582 --> 24:33.705
shouldn't have gone, came back and had a heart 
attack. Oh, good. I just wore myself down. I

24:36.689 --> 24:38.672
shouldn't have gone to that meeting. And that was 
five years ago then? Yeah. That was right after

24:41.156 --> 24:42.618
that conference. Okay. And, well, it didn't seem 
to slow your research down very much. You seemed to

24:47.826 --> 24:49.568
have recovered marvelously. I've been very 
fortunate. And so in the last several years, we're

24:53.714 --> 24:59.142
in effect involved in and interaction between 
oceans and seas. What sort of work have you done

25:02.341 --> 25:07.126
there that you think of particular significance?

25:09.468 --> 25:10.709
What's been the most important thing? What have 
you looked for? Well, I've found evidence of

25:11.670 --> 25:16.495
organized convection, evidence of roll 
vortices. Two papers have been published with

25:16.795 --> 25:25.263
clear evidence of

25:16.795 --> 25:25.263
roll vortices. This evidence is in the surface 
wind field. It shows an alternating of directions

25:28.147 --> 25:32.393
as these vortices move past a buoy. Then, for the 
first time, I've reported on the

25:33.374 --> 25:46.853
near-surface change in meteorological 
parameters and oceanographic parameters, which

25:33.374 --> 25:46.853
are associated with open and closed mesoscale 
convection cells. One interesting thing that's

25:49.217 --> 25:56.567
not of great importance, but I found evidence of a 
turd-ironal tide in winds, which hadn't been

25:49.217 --> 25:56.567
reported before. I've

25:58.133 --> 26:09.710
shown that over relatively short distances, wind 
statistics over the ocean can vary considerably,

25:58.133 --> 26:09.710
and that was not known. The usual thing is to take a 
weather ship and extrapolate a thousand miles all

26:09.750 --> 26:14.397
around it. You just can't do this.

26:19.126 --> 26:32.123
meteorological driving forces are subject to 
major changes in time and space that need to be

26:19.126 --> 26:32.123
studied if you're going to study any part of the 
RCNR action process.

26:33.385 --> 26:39.574
As a matter of fact, your work has continued on 
through 1977, doing these same kinds of things. Is

26:39.934 --> 26:42.478
that the direction you think your work will take 
you in the future? I think this is all I'm going to do

26:42.498 --> 26:44.561
from here on out. You think you're going to look at 
this large-scale interaction and the rest of the

26:44.581 --> 26:49.167
way through? Mesoscale interaction. I'm sorry, 
mesoscale interaction. This is miles to maybe 100

26:53.333 --> 27:01.664
miles or kilometers to 100 kilometers in time from 
minutes to a week. Okay. And out of curiosity, do

27:02.950 --> 27:07.756
you think weather prediction will come out of 
this? I think that, aside from resources in the

27:10.079 --> 27:22.354
sea, that the best opportunity for benefiting 
mankind that oceanographers and meteorologists

27:10.079 --> 27:22.354
have is in weather forecasting. And in order to do 
this, we have to understand air-sea interaction

27:22.374 --> 27:28.843
processes much, much better than we do at the 
present time. And this is one of the reasons we're

27:28.883 --> 27:32.367
working. How far away are you from long-range 
weather forecasting?

27:39.081 --> 27:41.985
Well, there are two ways of looking at that. One of 
the most pressing things is to improve our

27:42.045 --> 27:52.358
forecasting, say, from a four-day forecast to a 
five- or six- or seven-day forecast.

27:53.800 --> 27:54.861
We've been on A lot of people have been working on 
this, and no one seems to have come through with any

27:55.702 --> 28:00.089
breakthroughs. We're just sort of stuck on a 
roughly four-day forecast. But as far as

28:04.476 --> 28:18.317
long-period trends are concerned, six months in 
advance or a year in advance, I think the work of

28:04.476 --> 28:18.317
Nimaeus and a number of other people indicates 
clearly that we're going to be able to forecast

28:04.476 --> 28:18.317
trends a little better than we could before. But 
the most important, well, that's important in

28:19.968 --> 28:22.531
itself. But improving our weather forecasting by 
two days would make a tremendous economical

28:22.551 --> 28:30.140
impact on the country. Routing of fuels, 
electrical network management, all of these

28:31.582 --> 28:40.172
things depend on how weather changes around the 
country. And if we could do it in six or eight days,

28:40.493 --> 28:42.955
it would just be wonderful. But I'm not sure we can. 
And that's what we're all working on. And that's

28:46.440 --> 28:49.283
where your work is pressing presently. I think so.
