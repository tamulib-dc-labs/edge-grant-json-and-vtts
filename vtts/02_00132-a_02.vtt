WEBVTT

00:03.052 --> 00:05.215
The chairman of the council was running it. And he 
was the head of industrial education. Right,

00:07.719 --> 00:08.701
right. In fact, as a young professor at A&M, he had 
Earl Rutter in his class. Did you know that? No. Oh.

00:23.143 --> 00:26.629
And so they were really close friends. Mm-hmm. all 
of the stuff that went on between them. It was a very

00:31.311 --> 00:34.957
collegial affair between them. And I appreciated 
Chris Johnman recommending me to Earl Rudder.

00:43.410 --> 00:48.859
But, Rudman had been there since he hired Barry 
Bryant. I'm pretty sure he was the councilman. I

00:51.864 --> 00:55.249
understand that his picture was on the front page 
of Life magazine. with the old water tower in the

00:55.853 --> 01:03.403
background and how the Aggies hire a football 
coach or something like that. I've never seen that

01:03.623 --> 01:05.606
thing lately. I think I remember seeing it when it 
happened, because I was at Baylor in those years.

01:12.254 --> 01:21.827
By the way, after I accepted the contract from, 
that reminds me, the contract to come to A&M,

01:12.254 --> 01:21.827
Baylor tried to hire me there for exactly the same 
job at half the money.

01:32.278 --> 01:35.541
That was something. Baylor has sensed over the 
days that they've improved their situation

01:35.601 --> 01:40.747
really a great deal. But it was pretty poor pay. 
Man, I was really in high cotton to come down here.

01:46.552 --> 01:47.934
Twice what I would have gotten there. Let's see. 
Campus reaction to Mr. Rudder's death? Never

01:56.654 --> 02:05.486
forget it, the last day of my life, seeing the 
procession east of the academic building. Quiet,

02:05.506 --> 02:13.296
completely quiet column of people running to file 
taxes. The column had been tested in the system

02:13.316 --> 02:18.223
building there. And for me, going then to the 
memorial service in G. Raleigh, Alan Shivers,

02:18.760 --> 02:35.603
LBJ, everybody that mattered, John Connolly, all 
the great Texans were there. All right, you stayed

02:36.825 --> 02:42.372
with the counseling for how long? Until 70. And 
then what? And then I became associate dean of

02:45.256 --> 02:48.160
education under Frank Hubert. I still taught some 
of the courses that I've been always teaching. But

02:56.708 --> 03:04.920
the way that worked out, Dean Hubert had had 
someone writing the proposal to create a college

02:56.708 --> 03:04.920
of education. He'd already created the College of 
Science and the College of Business and all those

03:05.140 --> 03:09.386
others. And he was about to create the College of 
Liberal Arts and the College of Education. The

03:16.777 --> 03:18.940
person who was writing that proposal for him had 
said, had left suddenly in the middle of the year.

03:25.589 --> 03:46.311
And he knew that

03:25.589 --> 03:46.311
I'd been here nine years and I was sort of looking 
for a place to go somewhere else and so he called me

03:25.589 --> 03:46.311
in and offered me half time off to right finish that 
proposal and I've forgotten when he offered to

03:46.814 --> 03:57.443
take me on as associate dean, but in that spring 
semester there very soon after I started doing the

03:46.814 --> 03:57.443
work. So this is happening at about the time of Mr. 
Rudder's death and an interim president. Yeah,

04:04.250 --> 04:08.613
yeah. I got the impression that things were a 
little bit iffy around the campus while we had the

04:08.633 --> 04:15.960
interim president there for a while. party to the 
higher administration things. Even though I was

04:19.408 --> 04:24.275
associate dean, I was for students, associate 
dean for students. And so I didn't have any much

04:24.295 --> 04:31.046
contact with the upper level, mid-level 
administration. As far as you know, did Dean

04:31.066 --> 04:44.547
Hubert, was he very positive about being dean of 
education as that big college is broken up? I

04:45.944 --> 04:49.910
always had the impression that that was his aim as 
soon as he came. Same, I have that same feeling. I

04:52.455 --> 05:03.052
don't have anything to back it up except for... 
Well, I think University of Texas' experience

04:52.455 --> 05:03.052
with Silver over there might have had something to 
do with it. They never did break up the College of

05:03.473 --> 05:07.279
Arts and Science over there to this day. And I 
thought that was too much for one man to handle. and

05:12.387 --> 05:14.870
maintain equality with the cross. Describe his 
style of deaning. He gave you a job to do and turns

05:20.036 --> 05:22.960
you loose and lets you do it. I had a conference with 
him every Monday morning and told him what to do.

05:34.353 --> 05:36.876
I came on as associate dean June the 1st. after this 
spring. I'm working with a coordinating board and

05:38.589 --> 05:44.097
with him and everybody getting this proposal. And 
took it to Austin, came back to Austin again. All

05:47.742 --> 05:49.424
that stuff. I went on board and he took three weeks 
vacation. There was another associate dean, but

05:53.710 --> 06:00.880
he made it very clear that I was in charge while he 
was gone. So you almost started office. And it was

06:05.223 --> 06:07.667
an interesting time. All right, so you then went to 
academic council meetings and dean's meetings,

06:08.528 --> 06:14.397
APC meetings. Yeah. We had an associate dean's 
that did more of the work then, but yeah. All right,

06:20.666 --> 06:25.493
who presided over the meeting of the deans during 
that period? Well it was only a month. He was gone

06:27.837 --> 06:28.919
three weeks. So I really didn't go to a meeting of 
the deans. I was not called to go to a dean's

06:33.224 --> 06:35.466
meeting. I immediately started going to the 
associate dean's meeting. Because I'm thinking

06:37.749 --> 06:47.580
Byers was the, Horace Byers was the- I believe 
Horace Byers was the person that everybody went to

06:37.749 --> 06:47.580
at that time. By the way, he lived in this house at 
the time. Really? Yeah. Didn't know that.

06:54.599 --> 07:00.206
What do you think were Dean Hubert's goals for the 
College of Education? Make it the best teacher

07:00.226 --> 07:06.853
preparation college in the state of the nation, if 
he could. And what do you think he thought were the

07:07.774 --> 07:14.322
key steps to do to achieve that goal? Well, he had a 
lot of feeling about the early teaching

07:14.342 --> 07:22.952
experience. As far as I can tell, it was not a good 
situation. In fact, I don't think they had a

07:28.160 --> 07:35.769
teaching experience in the freshman and 
sophomore years at the time. They didn't get

07:35.789 --> 07:39.453
exposed to teaching at all at that time. And he 
moved in that direction.

07:45.100 --> 07:50.807
He was suspicious of bureaucracy at the same time. 
I'll never forget, we had One of the buzzwords at

07:53.746 --> 08:01.193
the time was performance-based teacher 
education, performance-based teacher

07:53.746 --> 08:01.193
counselor training, and all this. And one of our 
Monday morning meetings that I had with him alone,

08:02.914 --> 08:14.424
he said, and that is, he said, all this 
performance-based stuff, he said, it's not going

08:02.914 --> 08:14.424
to amount to anything. I thought in my head, most of 
the time I thought in my head, he said, 10 years from

08:15.365 --> 08:21.630
now, it's going to be the same. They'll forget this 
whole business. And I'll never forget the endless

08:24.290 --> 08:28.196
hours we worked on that. And the counseling 
program, of which I was a part by then, my faculty

08:28.576 --> 08:38.050
responsibility was as part of the counselor 
training program in the Department of

08:28.576 --> 08:38.050
Educational Psychology. We worked countless 
hours devising a performance-based counselor

08:40.053 --> 08:48.565
training program.

08:48.585 --> 08:50.027
And we forgot it in two or three years. But one of the 
reasons, one of the things he did which sort of

08:51.745 --> 09:19.152
moved me out of the position was we had a consortium 
of local school superintendents and college

08:51.745 --> 09:19.152
faculty and a third entity, oh, the educational 
service centers, a consortium to work on teacher

08:51.745 --> 09:19.152
training. And since I hadn't come out of teacher 
trained. I had been a psychologist all the way

09:23.058 --> 09:25.943
through. He thought that

09:25.963 --> 09:34.876
you could do better by moving Limbacher into that 
position. And me go back to the old blackberry

09:34.896 --> 09:39.642
college to teach him full time. And he gave me five 
thousand dollars. He only had a project he wanted

09:41.265 --> 09:42.927
to do. Move Limbacher in and said you take this and I 
want you to do a field survey recent graduates of

09:51.078 --> 09:57.328
teacher training here and see what they think the 
weakest point in their training was. I spent the

09:58.590 --> 10:18.300
spring semester, before I really got down to 
teaching again, I spent the spring semester, this

09:58.590 --> 10:18.300
was my event in 73, two or three years later, going 
around the countryside talking to school

09:58.590 --> 10:18.300
superintendents and principals about people 
they'd hired in the 12th century, talking to the

09:58.590 --> 10:18.300
people who said, Give him a short report after 
that, it was true. Do you remember the high points

10:22.460 --> 10:25.043
of that report? The high point was that there was 
not enough about teaching, enough about

10:25.063 --> 10:30.688
classroom management. And what was the strength? 
That was a weakness, what was the strength? Well,

10:36.593 --> 10:39.716
the strength was they came A&M. They were, A&M 
graduates were premium hires, especially in

10:39.736 --> 10:46.802
health and physical education. People would, 
superintendents from all over the countryside

10:48.335 --> 10:55.286
would flock to get those people because I- Why? 
Because they had a rigid academic program, even

10:56.147 --> 10:59.432
those days. There were not a bunch of football 
players. Who deserved the credit for that? Well,

11:03.238 --> 11:07.564
you're going to have to give Carl Linus part of it, 
at least. And that started before Frank Hubert and

11:08.105 --> 11:11.310
I ever came. Carl Linus was doing a good job of 
preparing PE teachers a long time ago. Any other

11:17.393 --> 11:23.559
names in that department appropriate to mention? 
In health and PE? Well, of course, very soon,

11:26.622 --> 11:33.689
believe it or not, he was upgrading. And he brought 
in, that's when he brought in George Jessup from

11:33.709 --> 11:39.575
California. Jessup. J-E-S-S-U-P. George 
Jessup. His specialty of course was human

11:45.355 --> 11:49.139
performance. Not the kind of performance based on 
the stuff we were talking about before, but I mean

11:50.621 --> 11:57.249
physical human performance. And he started a lab 
over there which is going today. George is not a

11:59.532 --> 12:01.974
part of it. He started that thing. And I was one of 
his guinea pigs. The first one he called over and

12:05.779 --> 12:14.569
gave that battery test where he spent two hours 
running me through the mills like the astronauts.

12:15.157 --> 12:17.500
I think they're still going today. Yeah. Other key 
family members in? In health and P.E.

12:25.028 --> 12:25.308
Mm-hmm. Oh, there are a good bunch of people. I 
hesitate to single out any of them that I became

12:27.971 --> 12:33.537
friends with. I became friends with a whole bunch 
of people. Now, let's see. Grunemann in

12:39.143 --> 12:42.126
industrial ed, that was over, Was that in 
engineering? Engineering, but they didn't have

12:45.025 --> 12:50.492
too much connection with engineering. They were 
really an education department. Ag education was

12:53.937 --> 12:56.100
a part of agriculture. In fact, when I drew up the 
chart to take to the coordinating board, you had a

12:56.180 --> 13:03.510
line going through the Dean of Agriculture and one 
going through the Dean of Education. But all the

13:04.511 --> 13:08.136
other departments were solely in the College of 
Education. I see. So there was... What were the

13:11.907 --> 13:13.208
other departments in? Curriculum instruction, 
administration, educational psychology,

13:13.869 --> 13:23.977
ag education, industrial education. Education 
and physical health, H and PE. Yeah. Did campus

13:29.762 --> 13:41.492
reputation, was one of those thought to be harder 
than the others academically or softer than the

13:29.762 --> 13:41.492
others academically? Yeah, there's no doubt that 
health and physical education had the reputation

13:42.940 --> 13:48.747
to be the toughest. The toughest? Yeah. All right, 
did any of them have the reputation of being the

13:50.089 --> 13:52.612
softest? I don't know of any, but I was just 
wondering if.

13:58.180 --> 14:00.282
If any, it would be curriculum and instruction.

14:03.406 --> 14:07.592
There were, you looked to see where the football 
players were. And some of them went to industrial

14:09.774 --> 14:11.817
education. And some of them came to curriculum 
instruction. But see, education and psychology

14:16.379 --> 14:22.585
didn't have any undergraduates, so we didn't 
suffer that way. But when I was associate dean, at

14:22.605 --> 14:34.616
that time we had a policy that we just do darn near 
anything in terms of transferring students. It's

14:34.676 --> 14:39.981
become a nightmare now to transfer from 
engineering to education or business or

14:34.676 --> 14:39.981
whatever. But in those days, if a guy came in and 
could convince me that he was misplaced in

14:40.670 --> 14:49.639
engineering, back to my counseling days, I 
remembered very well. So many people were caught

14:50.600 --> 14:57.807
up in the romance of the space age and the romance of 
engineering that they went over there whether

14:50.600 --> 14:57.807
they ought to go over there or not. So I was pulling 
people into education and doing everything I

14:58.528 --> 15:05.715
could legally, which was quite a bit. to get them at 
the College of Education and get them graduated.

15:12.405 --> 15:23.803
And at that time I was allowed to take

15:12.405 --> 15:23.803
F's off their degree plan. Still had them on the 
transcript. I made out a degree plan for them and I

15:26.027 --> 15:29.513
didn't put down the F's and the D's. I put down the 
courses they made up. And then they had to continue

15:34.147 --> 15:38.471
to make good courses in education, and they 
graduated. And it's much harder to do that today.

15:40.794 --> 15:43.516
It's not impossible, but it's much, much harder 
today. The reason I know this, of course, is

15:43.536 --> 16:00.373
because my daughter, Chris Boyd, is in the same 
position this day and time, where I hear her tell

15:43.536 --> 16:00.373
about how hard it is to transfer from college 
education, to transfer from general studies,

15:43.536 --> 16:00.373
which she supervises. But for the two and a half 
years I was there, I had pretty much free hand. But

16:06.737 --> 16:11.205
we didn't have any identity. Dean Hubert and I 
decided we'd have a complication of all education

16:11.225 --> 16:18.416
majors. We put out plenty of publicity and we got a 
big meeting room, 330 seats over the temperature

16:18.436 --> 16:26.209
building. and specified a night we thought that it 
would be available to anybody but a handful. Which

16:35.573 --> 16:39.739
gave us a signal that there was no real identity 
with the college there. And I'm not sure we have any

16:39.959 --> 16:45.206
identity anywhere else the same way on the campus. 
You have some identity with departments. There

16:48.630 --> 16:51.634
they have an in-group feeling. But he was looking 
for the in-group feeling there. And I guess one of

16:55.417 --> 16:59.723
the reasons he hired me was, hey, here's a 
counselor. Maybe he can help us with this business

17:00.865 --> 17:04.570
of creating an atmosphere. In the early 70s, when 
the College of Education was created, Dean's

17:05.712 --> 17:12.182
office was in... The old library. The library. 
Then moved over to academic... Oh, uh... Let's see

17:21.134 --> 17:23.056
what that sequence was. Don't I remember his 
office, Hubert's office, being on the south end of

17:23.076 --> 17:28.362
academic? Yeah, first floor. Yeah. That's where 
the reason for that was

17:30.784 --> 17:37.832
the Department of Education had been there. Okay. 
See? And when he became dean, for a while he was also

17:39.814 --> 17:46.942
department head of curriculum instruction as 
well as dean. Where were the other academicians?

17:49.197 --> 17:50.940
other departments of education. The old red brick 
building that they called, oh it used to have

17:50.960 --> 18:00.095
Textile Engineering in it. It sits over there now. 
Where?

18:08.730 --> 18:09.290
I forget. It's north of the library, somewhere in 
there. It's now been torn down. Yeah, and then our

18:14.300 --> 18:16.504
department scattered out. Part of them went to one 
building and part to another until we finished the

18:16.564 --> 18:20.971
education building. When the college is created, 
did it have master's degrees? And doctor's

18:28.584 --> 18:29.425
degrees. And doctoral degrees, both at that 
point? Yes. The way he did that was check a little

18:32.951 --> 18:34.614
block. You haven't heard that tale? No, no. share 
that. When he applied, I didn't see this piece of

18:40.240 --> 18:52.672
paper, but when he applied to the Coordinating 
Board for what degrees will you offer at the

18:40.240 --> 18:52.672
College of Education, it had little boxes there to 
check, bachelor's, master's, doctor's. So we

18:52.692 --> 18:53.392
checked them all. That's all the rest of it. Didn't 
have to go through a study or anything. We started

18:58.097 --> 19:04.083
out in 68 or whenever it was, we had that. And we had a 
PhD right then. I was chairman of the, I guess the

19:07.447 --> 19:13.598
second Ph.D. in Canada. I was chairman of the 
committee,

19:13.618 --> 19:20.289
Wesley Saunders. We had, the first one was an 
education major, but as an Arab from Egypt, and he

19:20.309 --> 19:31.969
went back to Egypt I guess, but Wesley was the first 
one after him. Well, I say I was the chair. I was the

19:33.806 --> 19:36.269
working chair at Haskell. Somebody else was the 
chair. I forget who now, but because it was in test

19:38.673 --> 19:44.081
and measurement, they let me run the thing. And 
Wesley and I grounded out pretty quick there. But

19:48.688 --> 19:50.771
yeah, that's where we got the PhD. And when we went, 
that was as the Department of Education and

19:51.372 --> 19:54.998
Psychology. Then we went to the College of 
Education, all the five departments, six

20:00.299 --> 20:06.610
departments, had the same degrees offered. See, 
that's the upper level. So at Sac, they never did

20:08.152 --> 20:15.004
have to go through a coordinating board, you know, 
a stealth study in order to get their Ph.D. So it was

20:15.164 --> 20:17.007
an Ed.D. and a Ph.D. either or both. Either or both. 
Okay. In every department. In every department.

20:23.338 --> 20:23.438
Yeah. Imagine what it would be like today to try to 
get a number of southern associations and Texas

20:23.637 --> 20:33.065
Education Agency staff studies out down 30 years. 
Wow. Do you remember in those changes any examples

20:35.067 --> 20:53.323
of higher administration and or board of 
directors, it would have been called then,

20:35.067 --> 20:53.323
involvement, positive or negative?

20:53.725 --> 20:56.049
Nope, I don't. There may have been some. I don't 
know. I think Dean Hubert's influence statewide

21:01.457 --> 21:06.244
was really considerable. And I'm reading between 
the lines here. I think he had a little bit of an end

21:11.072 --> 21:17.401
with the Texas Education Agency as well as the 
Board of Education. I think you're right. First of

21:18.783 --> 21:20.686
all, he'd worked for Dr. Edgar. Yeah. and I have 
always assumed that that was the connection that

21:21.873 --> 21:34.470
may have led Earl Rudder to know who Frank Hubert 
was in the summer of 1959. Well, I think

21:36.873 --> 21:50.091
you have to check this out, but I thought that the 
Rudders and the Huberts lived neighborhood close

21:50.678 --> 21:53.681
in Austin. Oh, didn't know that. Across the alley 
or whatever. Didn't know that. You have to check

21:57.104 --> 21:58.806
that out to be sure. Because they were there at the 
same time. At the same time, yeah. He stayed over

22:02.129 --> 22:02.849
there. Rudder came to the Texas Edge, came to the 
Rudder Land Board in 52, I believe, when we had a big

22:04.972 --> 22:14.521
scandal over there. I was in graduate school in 
Texas, so I knew all about it. In fact, the guy who

22:17.724 --> 22:19.285
was Baskin-Giles. Baskin-Giles. His sister was 
in my classes at the University of Texas. Sort of a

22:28.923 --> 22:31.826
situation there. But then he, Rudder, came over 
and stayed about six or eight years. And came over

22:38.755 --> 22:40.437
here as Vice President. And he brought some people 
with him. He brought, I think he brought Frank

22:43.781 --> 22:45.483
Hewlett. I think he brought the guy who became the 
Comptroller.

22:52.272 --> 22:58.438
He lived across the street from me down . And his 
wife is still in First Presbyterian Church down

22:58.458 --> 23:01.621
there with him. Oh, oh, oh. Do you know who that is? 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, cool. Well, I think Rudder

23:05.604 --> 23:07.306
brought him. OK. Fill me in chronologically as you 
recall it. Mr. Rudder dies. And for most of us, it

23:15.593 --> 23:20.718
seemed comparatively sudden. Yeah. Do you 
remember any feelings of the

23:22.546 --> 23:30.634
interim period? I can remember uncertainty. And 
they didn't trust the guy who was the guy who was

23:34.939 --> 23:40.084
interim. The general was at Freeman. I think it was 
Clyde Freeman. Clyde Freeman. I think so. People

23:47.592 --> 23:51.436
felt he didn't know anything about the academic 
division. They were afraid of him. those months

23:52.600 --> 23:56.505
there went by while he acted. I know the guy and I 
didn't have much feeling one way or the other, but I

23:56.906 --> 24:04.577
felt the campus was a little uncertain of itself. 
Do you remember any reaction to hearing that they

24:05.218 --> 24:09.223
had selected a new president?

24:12.708 --> 24:13.189
That fall? No, except relief. You know the story 
about Tiger Teague being on the campus and when

24:21.541 --> 24:23.743
Williams came, don't you? No, share that. Down 
there, and of course we're in the time of students

24:27.107 --> 24:37.398
marching on the president's homes, and so the 
students marched on the president's home. And

24:38.500 --> 24:43.665
Tiger Thief went to the door and said, oh my God, 
they've got to march on the president's home.

24:43.685 --> 24:46.769
They're down here to protest. Williams walked on 
out. They'd come to welcome me, not to criticize

24:48.355 --> 24:52.521
me. That was one of the unusual things. The whole 
cadet corps was out there, I think, and others were

24:55.145 --> 25:01.594
out there in the front yard to greet the new 
president. What was your impression of Jack

25:01.874 --> 25:03.997
Williams? Man, we could never have, we could look 
for years and never got a better one. He

25:10.046 --> 25:15.694
complemented completely and totally Rudder's 
regime. Complemented it. And he told a joke the

25:17.903 --> 25:22.148
first time he spoke in front of the faculty. He told 
a joke, I'm sure you were there, about the old Aggie

25:22.988 --> 25:32.279
who talked to him and said, Mr. Williams, you're 
the first non-Aggie. We're going to be watching

25:32.299 --> 25:37.464
you damn

25:32.299 --> 25:37.464
close. And what was your impression of his

25:37.484 --> 25:43.270
various abilities? Man, there's just no 
question. I thought he was ideal in every way. It's

25:50.617 --> 25:54.022
too bad he couldn't have lived longer and made an 
oral remark. Of course that summer, Frank Hubert

25:55.824 --> 26:08.001
had sent me off, I was just in, and he'd sent me off to 
this seminar for new administrators. Remember

26:08.022 --> 26:08.582
that thing? Did you ever go to that thing? You want 
to hear? Yeah. I've spoken to it 21 years ago. Yeah,

26:13.649 --> 26:15.552
okay, but Did you go through it as a participant? We 
had a week here and a week up on the TCU campus. And

26:23.136 --> 26:27.861
Williams, of course, addressed us there. And I 
never forget the joke he told about the steam

26:29.062 --> 26:33.546
whistle. You heard that one? You ought to get that 
one down if you haven't heard it. First morning he

26:37.930 --> 26:41.674
came to work and the whistle blew at the power 
plant. And at 12 o'clock it blew again. He asked the

26:44.435 --> 26:45.977
secretary, what was that? He said, that's 8, 12, 1, 
and 5. That's the whistle it was. And he said, I

26:51.704 --> 26:54.187
picked up the phone and called the plant. Told 
them, never blow that thing again. This is an

26:55.770 --> 26:58.413
academic institution. And to this group of 
budding administrators, he says, and that It's

27:04.435 --> 27:09.562
more initiative than I would have taken at any 
other time in my administrative career. Not

27:10.283 --> 27:11.324
daring to do that. My first day on the job, stop the 
whistle.

27:17.032 --> 27:19.836
Who were his key associates? That's harder for me 
to get at. Nah.

27:32.549 --> 27:37.617
I believe you're going to have to get a lot of that 
from somewhere else, because I don't remember. By

27:38.418 --> 27:49.856
this time, I was out of the administrative cycle 
and into being a new faculty member full time in a

27:38.418 --> 27:49.856
department which had a few troubles. All right, 
let's look at these two presidents now. I'm going

27:53.361 --> 27:54.403
to ask the negative. What were the key decisions 
that you can think of during their times. Well one

28:05.550 --> 28:20.494
minor one that so fits the other thing about 
Williams was we were having all the bomb threats

28:05.550 --> 28:20.494
around the campus and Williams called the 
associate deans together and said You're the

28:20.862 --> 28:23.867
administrators and so forth. We said, I'm here to 
tell you that we're going to run this campus. We're

28:26.571 --> 28:27.873
going to take all precautions. We're not going to 
close down any building any time for a bomb threat.

28:35.224 --> 28:41.553
That's an early decision, and I thought it was the 
kind of decision which needed to be made, and he

28:35.224 --> 28:41.553
made it. How many more bomb threats did we have? I 
don't think so. Whether we got out or not. That's

28:47.947 --> 28:49.910
the one I remember now. There must have been some 
others. He also had

28:52.995 --> 29:02.048
the...

29:02.068 --> 29:13.325
He is the one who...

29:02.068 --> 29:13.325
Let's

29:02.068 --> 29:13.325
see. What about his... described Williams as a 
speaker before. Complete control. Every word as

29:21.829 --> 29:29.421
if he'd planned it weeks in advance and spoken just 
exactly with the right inflection of his voice.

29:31.164 --> 29:32.707
That was my impression of it. Yeah.

29:38.116 --> 29:39.739
And let's see. In education, y'all didn't make any 
major changes under Williams because y'all were

29:40.141 --> 29:51.776
already there in terms of the degrees and the 
organization and so forth. We did get national

29:52.376 --> 29:59.385
recognition for our programs from the 
professional societies. Educational

29:59.405 --> 30:01.267
psychology did at the time. We had counseling in 
psychology and school psychology. besides being

30:04.913 --> 30:15.710
accredited, you also get approval by the National 
Associations, and we got that through long before

30:04.913 --> 30:15.710
the Department of Psychology did, by the way. Long 
before. Do you remember any

30:17.192 --> 30:24.183
comments relating to those reviews? Any

30:24.203 --> 30:28.370
judgments? We didn't get ever, there was never a 
question. as we went forward. We presented enough

30:34.188 --> 30:36.751
data. We got so much support from the Institute of 
Statistics, from the Department of Psychology,

30:36.771 --> 30:45.639
from the Department of Sociology. There was never 
a question that we would get it the first time we

30:46.100 --> 30:50.964
went forward with the proposal. And it was 
renewed. I was coordinator of the counseling

30:52.946 --> 30:59.012
program at the time. And no question about it. At 
that time, with whom did the A&M College of

31:02.980 --> 31:11.975
Education most often compare itself in the 
region? Who was the competing program, the

31:12.095 --> 31:17.845
parallel program? Well, always a little bit of 
comparison between the equal sized University of

31:19.287 --> 31:25.418
Texas and us there. But the other teacher prep 
institutions Commerce had a real good

31:29.913 --> 31:34.975
reputation.

31:36.702 --> 31:40.277
Huntsville had a good reputation.
