00:01.381 --> 00:05.746
Mr. Taylor, can you tell me your rank and 
organization when you were in Vietnam? In 1966, I

00:05.766 --> 00:15.276
was a warrant officer, helicopter pilot, the 
119th Assault Helicopter Company at Pleiku,

00:05.766 --> 00:15.276
Vietnam. My first tour ended in November 1967.

00:22.244 --> 00:30.713
My second tour, I was a chief warrant officer with 
the 101st Airborne Division at Camp Eagle, Hue,

00:22.244 --> 00:30.713
Vietnam. from October 69 through October 70. In 
1971, I was on temporary duty at Fan Rang for a few

00:34.561 --> 00:40.847
days. I left the service as a Chief Warrant 
Officer.

00:50.237 --> 00:57.164
Okay, as a helicopter pilot, what was your single 
most important contribution in the American

00:50.237 --> 00:57.164
Forces, in your opinion? I believe it was the 
ability to provide mobility to the ground forces.

01:06.365 --> 01:17.096
It enabled us to eliminate a lot of the mistakes of 
the French at the military level, though I think at

01:06.365 --> 01:17.096
the political level we made a lot of the same 
mistakes.

01:20.059 --> 01:30.670
Individually, it allowed

01:20.059 --> 01:30.670
us to develop tactics and lessons learned which 
has enabled us currently to counter a lot of our

01:32.320 --> 01:44.412
potential adversaries, conventional weapons 
threats, armor especially.

01:46.954 --> 01:59.847
I can't say individually where I had any great 
contributions other than learning the tactics,

01:46.954 --> 01:59.847
becoming an instructor, and then passing those on 
to men between tours, and I felt that that probably

02:00.603 --> 02:04.728
saved a lot of lives because the military, as 
usual, is slow to respond. So a lot of us knew that

02:04.788 --> 02:09.853
the school solution was not the right answer. And 
as a result, we taught the young men the lessons

02:11.015 --> 02:21.947
that we had learned in Vietnam and better prepared 
the second generation of pilots that had to go over

02:11.015 --> 02:21.947
there. I believe the mobility. So do you think 
there would have been a drastic difference in the

02:26.371 --> 02:31.316
way the war was fought without the use of the 
helicopter? Yes, and it

02:31.636 --> 02:48.131
might have been better because during the Vietnam 
War, terrain, seizing and holding terrain, was

02:31.636 --> 02:48.131
not as important to us as it had been in earlier 
wars. Such as Korea? Well, such as Korea, such as

02:49.973 --> 02:55.298
the French Indochina War in World War II, That was 
one of our blessings, but it may have been a curse

02:56.881 --> 03:04.270
because we didn't secure, quotes, military lines 
of communication. And as a result, a lot of gaps

03:05.371 --> 03:18.747
were left that allowed the guerrilla army and 
later the North Vietnamese army using guerrilla

03:05.371 --> 03:18.747
tactics to pretty well move at will, especially at 
night. It also left a lot of villages susceptible

03:26.615 --> 03:30.919
to the influence of those armies. The local cadres 
were decimated in Tet, yet this absence of our

03:31.340 --> 03:56.605
controlling completely the lines of 
communications and holding terrain allowed the

03:31.340 --> 03:56.605
infiltration of North Vietnamese army units to 
completely maintain their domination

03:31.340 --> 03:56.605
in certain areas. over the local population. Now, 
the blessings I'd have it was by our being able to

04:01.035 --> 04:12.469
move, not be restricted to roads, rail, etc. It 
held the casualties down considerably. I'm

04:17.475 --> 04:22.882
convinced that if it hadn't been for the 
helicopter, one of two things would have

04:17.475 --> 04:22.882
happened. We would have left very early, or we 
would have escalated the war to a greater

04:25.812 --> 04:38.206
conflict,

04:25.812 --> 04:38.206
quite possibly even tried tactical nukes, 
because in those days the thinking was that they

04:25.812 --> 04:38.206
were a useful weapon.

04:42.151 --> 04:52.883
I don't believe we would have politically 
withstood something along the lines of the French

04:42.151 --> 04:52.883
casualty rate in their war in Indochina. I don't 
believe that we would have politically withstood

04:53.757 --> 04:58.342
a Dien Bien Phu. And given the climate prior to 
1969, I think that a major defeat for American

04:59.304 --> 05:11.258
forces in Vietnam would have led to an American 
outcry to escalate, not as later. This slow

05:11.318 --> 05:19.968
bleeding process and the news bringing that into 
the rooms every night led to an anti-war feeling. I

05:19.988 --> 05:23.292
think that the shock of a major defeat would have 
been much like the shock of Pearl Harbor or a major

05:23.879 --> 05:33.318
battle in Europe. I see. So the use of the 
helicopter, its importance is a lot more I think it

05:40.349 --> 05:43.593
basically allowed the Vietnam War to go on for 10 
years. It's a lot more important than it appeared

05:43.613 --> 05:45.035
to be. It was more than just a piece of machinery. 
Yes, it was not an ambulance. In the early days, we

05:48.420 --> 06:02.980
learned to fight with it and turned it into a very, 
very good fighting platform, a good

05:48.420 --> 06:02.980
transportation platform, and a good civil 
platform. One of the outgrowths today of that war

06:03.260 --> 06:07.386
is the abundance of helicopter pilots, 
helicopter-oriented individuals in the

06:08.125 --> 06:14.432
American civil community. And as a result, you've 
got all of the life flights, the care flights, the

06:14.472 --> 06:26.506
ability to exploit the oil offshore, things that 
were not possible in the mid-'60s. These are a

06:26.626 --> 06:29.089
direct result of the war. The bad thing is is that 
transportation ability allowed us to avoid a

06:29.109 --> 06:37.879
major defeat because we could extract our forces 
very quickly. or rapidly reinforce our forces

06:38.332 --> 06:41.095
very quickly. As a result, we very seldom suffered 
a defeat above the company level. As a matter of

06:44.978 --> 06:51.024
fact, we did not suffer a single military defeat at 
the battle or campaign level during the war.

06:51.685 --> 06:53.967
That's all because of the helicopter. The French 
lost regiments. Between Mangyang Pass and

06:56.269 --> 07:07.140
Pleiku, where I was stationed, the 2nd Korea 
Regiment, after the French withdrawal had begun,

07:07.542 --> 07:12.811
practically decimated in that 20-mile, 25-mile 
stretch of road. And then as they tried to retreat

07:12.831 --> 07:16.577
south, they were further beat up. I saw parts of 
their armored vehicles laying in the jungle when I

07:16.717 --> 07:23.188
was over there fighting in 67. and this had 
occurred several years before. They did not have

07:27.137 --> 07:33.984
the helicopter to the extent that we did, even 
though they did originally try to arm it, and they

07:27.137 --> 07:33.984
used it for some medical evacuation. So the 
Americans protected it basically? I think that we

07:35.766 --> 07:52.804
kept our infantry in Vietnam from 1964, 65, until 
1973 at a basic no-win, no-defeat level. because

07:54.235 --> 07:58.440
of the ability of the helicopter to maneuver our 
troops. I think had we not had the helicopter, the

07:58.460 --> 08:04.506
decision would have had to been made very early, 
win it or lose it. It allowed our political people

08:04.526 --> 08:17.501
to maintain a, quote, acceptable casualty level 
over a long period of time without committing the

08:04.526 --> 08:17.501
national will to either victory or to cut their 
losses. So I believe that that small group of

08:18.062 --> 08:23.888
chopper pilots were... were the reasons that we 
held out so long, reasons our casualties were so

08:26.078 --> 08:31.725
low. And for your information, we've gathered 
data since to kind of prove the theory of that war.

08:40.696 --> 08:45.142
Now, what we did, though, was one in five of us died 
on the first tour. And one in three of us died if we

08:47.205 --> 08:50.409
served two tours. That's a hell of a price to pay 
among the best young men the country has, because

08:55.340 --> 09:05.352
the military pilot requirements require the 
absolute brightest and best physical

08:55.340 --> 09:05.352
people. Anything else? Were there any policies or 
rules of any sort that you felt restricted you,

09:07.755 --> 09:11.799
made you incapable? Very restricted policies. We 
understood them, but they were very restrictive.

09:16.485 --> 09:25.195
In 1967, at least in the two core area, and this was 
general policy of the 17th Aviation Group and I

09:25.732 --> 09:30.617
believe the 1st Aviation Brigade.

09:31.638 --> 09:36.244
It was definite policy of my battalion, the 52nd. 
We could not return fire when we were being fired on

09:36.264 --> 09:43.151
if we were in certain areas. Now we did have those 
areas that were known as free fire zones. Those are

09:46.815 --> 09:53.983
areas that the Vietnamese authorities and the 
military had made a sweep, had removed the people.

09:54.723 --> 09:56.325
or at least those that wanted to come out. And 
activity in that area was considered completely

09:57.787 --> 10:05.497
enemy activity. And the area around Pleiku, a lot 
of it is jungle. Now, Pleiku sits on a high plateau,

10:11.324 --> 10:17.252
plain-type area, but it ends in mountains all 
around it. And those vary from 5 or 10 miles. For

10:20.556 --> 10:24.561
instance, the Yadrang Valley is just about a 10- to 
15-minute flight southwest from Camp Holloway at

10:24.997 --> 10:28.522
Pleiku. That's how close we were to a battle you may 
be familiar with. It was the first big battle

10:31.326 --> 10:35.031
involving American forces. Doctoe was 25 minutes 
north.

10:44.063 --> 10:47.909
The area called Dragon Mountain, we called it 
Titty Mountain. The newspapers named it Dragon

10:47.929 --> 10:54.818
Mountain, and the 4th Division named it Dragon 
Mountain because they didn't like our name for it.

10:55.928 --> 11:00.454
Uh, the, these are, these are battles, uh, 
cheerio. Uh, the, the, these valleys are, are just

11:01.915 --> 11:09.064
minutes away from camp Holloway play coup. And as a 
result, our battalion thought in all of those

11:09.525 --> 11:17.815
engagements, but there are a lot of villages 
around there. Many of these villages are more

11:18.876 --> 11:25.024
friendly and for the most part, very, very 
friendly to the American forces. I went down one

11:25.342 --> 11:40.475
time with absolutely nothing on board because 
toward the end of my tour I was doing a test flight

11:25.342 --> 11:40.475
and had gone out to do a visual reconnaissance for 
the battalion intelligence and had an engine

11:25.342 --> 11:40.475
failure. I went down by this mountain yard 
village. The deadliest thing I had on board was a

11:42.677 --> 11:46.440
P-38 can opener. I mean, these people could have 
killed us. They didn't. They came out and were real

11:49.402 --> 11:50.803
friendly. Next day I dropped them some parachute

11:50.823 --> 11:55.247
claw. The business that every village and 
everybody considered the people on the ground as

11:55.666 --> 12:04.720
hostile was not true, at least among the 
helicopter pilots. But we did get shot at from the

12:04.840 --> 12:06.884
ground. And we knew there were a lot of areas and a 
lot of villages that were hostile to us to some

12:06.944 --> 12:12.072
degree. But what would happen is the North 
Vietnamese, and it was primarily NVA in my area,

12:13.194 --> 12:22.348
would move in near a village and shoot at us and want 
us to strafe, want us to fire back because they knew

12:23.138 --> 12:34.031
that we would, our weapon systems weren't precise 
enough to pick out a single individual. We would

12:34.832 --> 12:39.658
pick out a single area with rockets or a single area 
with machine guns. And so they knew that we would

12:40.839 --> 12:43.943
create casualties. As a result, our commanders 
issued orders and very strictly enforced those

12:43.963 --> 12:49.410
orders. We had one guy strafe a Buddhist temple 
once because he had been fired up. We'd been

12:56.188 --> 13:01.696
getting fired up by this, around this temple for 
days. Every time we would fly past, I'd been shot at

13:02.817 --> 13:05.741
there. Old Jim got hit one day. His aircraft got 
hit. He loaded, or unloaded on him. And the

13:12.751 --> 13:15.054
commander got very upset. Jim's attitude was, 
sir, when they shooted me that often, shame on

13:16.456 --> 13:20.602
them. He put a stop to it. Nothing happened, but as a 
general rule, especially at night, getting fired

13:23.433 --> 13:37.630
on from known village areas, we didn't return 
fire, and any number of pilots had that.

13:41.014 --> 13:43.096
Can I give you an instance? Let's see what that 
question is. Just an example. Can I give an

13:45.319 --> 13:49.103
example? when I felt powerless to do anything. I 
don't think you'll like this answer because it's

13:51.810 --> 13:57.275
not politically a Vietnam answer per se. 1975,

13:57.395 --> 14:18.195
when I saw those tanks rolling down in the news 
film, rolling down from the north and watching the

13:57.395 --> 14:18.195
south collapse, watching the leadership in the 
United States fail to do what they promised two

13:57.395 --> 14:18.195
years earlier, which was to commit U.S. bombers to 
interdict any major raids to the south. And a few

14:24.823 --> 14:28.167
B-52 raids would have sent the message to the 
north. They would have said, oh boy, turned around

14:28.928 --> 14:32.272
and gone back. It took that kind of action to make 
them release our prisoners. That same kind of

14:38.939 --> 14:42.322
action would have let them know that we were 
serious. The French-trained officer corps at the

14:44.405 --> 14:48.469
very top of the South Vietnamese Army was as 
corrupt as the French Army was in 1940 because the

14:49.192 --> 15:03.327
same colonial officers basically still ran the 
damn thing and trained these people. Most of the

15:03.347 --> 15:08.452
officers, the high-ranking officers, were 
French trained. Now, at the colonel level and

15:09.734 --> 15:18.523
lieutenant colonel level and below, American 
trained officers were beginning to move up. At the

15:19.178 --> 15:24.846
major level and below, almost every one of them was 
American trained. And what had happened there is

15:26.288 --> 15:38.184
friends of mine in the Vietnamese services woke 
up, they were captains and majors, and they said, I

15:26.288 --> 15:38.184
woke up in Da Nang one morning and I was the highest 
ranking officer there. The colonels and the

15:39.866 --> 15:41.488
generals had left. They'd gotten the word. So, my 
most helpless feeling was to sit there and watch

15:49.604 --> 15:52.708
that country fall. And the words of our president 
and our country committed to two years earlier,

15:54.971 --> 16:11.210
albeit we were involved in a Watergate-type 
situation, it was pretty well over with, and we had

15:54.971 --> 16:11.210
an interim government, if you will, under Nixon's 
predecessor. There was no willingness to keep

16:12.492 --> 16:16.557
that commitment. to watch these people fleeing 
south by the thousands, jamming the roads, not

16:18.933 --> 16:29.526
just the military, but thousands of civilians 
moving south. These people didn't want the

16:30.607 --> 16:32.289
communists. They saw the communists at Hue in 
1968. They saw the communists, for the most part,

16:36.815 --> 16:43.102
in the north after the French. But to sit there and 
watch them come south, And no, there's not a damn

16:47.722 --> 16:50.185
thing you can do about it. There's not a thing your 
government's going to do about it. I'm not saying

16:54.810 --> 16:57.173
we should have recommitted the draftees. By now, 
we had a ground army in the Arvins that were

16:57.493 --> 17:02.479
trained. They had some good leaders and they had 
some bad leaders. But an infantryman is as good as

17:08.266 --> 17:11.489
his leadership. Anyone who ever tells you 
Vietnamese can't fight doesn't understand

17:17.438 --> 17:18.079
leadership. The North Vietnamese and the South 
Vietnamese are the same people. That was going to

17:22.044 --> 17:23.205
be my next question. What you thought about the 
Army? Well, I'll get to that in just a minute. I want

17:26.829 --> 17:28.331
to finish my helpless feet. To watch this come 
south and then to take a look at people you've known

17:28.471 --> 17:44.931
and to realize what they're getting into, to see 
the South fall and to know that leaders such as the

17:28.471 --> 17:44.931
infantry colonel who realized all was lost. He 
could have very easily done like a lot of them did

17:47.525 --> 17:56.814
and got on a plane, but he felt like someone had to 
uphold the honor and he went out in front of the

17:47.525 --> 17:56.814
statue of the unknown soldier and put a bullet in 
his head. To see dedicated people like that

17:59.176 --> 18:12.589
betrayed

17:59.176 --> 18:12.589
by a group of what I call political opportunists 
who started Using the anti-war sentiment in the

18:12.907 --> 18:33.809
late 60s to gain political power by the mid-70s, to 
watch that occur here reminded me a lot of what I've

18:12.907 --> 18:33.809
read about the Weimar Republic in Germany toward 
the end and afterward of the First World War. It was

18:33.829 --> 18:40.836
a very helpful speech and one I'll never forget, 
one I don't intend to ever let my sons participate

18:33.829 --> 18:40.836
in. You know my sons and you know the way they've 
been been taught, you know, that they take

18:44.058 --> 18:48.304
nobody's word for anything. They go get original 
references where possible, read them and examine

18:48.324 --> 18:53.692
them. Could not be another generation if I could 
help. Let me be involved. And the colonels and

18:58.680 --> 19:04.809
generals of today are the lieutenants and 
captains of yesterday. And you can see the

19:06.211 --> 19:10.878
distrust they had, even with the crappy little job 
they were given. Take out this little Banana

19:13.049 --> 19:15.753
Republic. They went down and they did it. They did 
it very quickly with a minimum expenditure of

19:17.256 --> 19:19.920
life. They allowed no reporters and no political 
interference once the decision was done until the

19:20.020 --> 19:26.230
job was over. I think that is another tragedy of 
Vietnam. It put a distrust between our military

19:30.998 --> 19:40.052
leadership and some of the political and media 
types. I think we'll suffer from that until the

19:40.842 --> 19:48.772
Vietnam generation of officers are retired, and 
maybe longer. That was helpless. That was not in

19:49.493 --> 19:50.675
combat. Helpless feelings in combat is when 
you're sitting there and mortar shells and

19:51.856 --> 19:59.747
rockets are raining down and you don't have an 
airplane under your butt so you can move and

19:51.856 --> 19:59.747
maneuver. I feel totally helpless.

20:06.104 --> 20:09.808
Different people that served in Vietnam have 
different things to say about Arvin. Some say they

20:09.828 --> 20:11.189
were dedicated. Some say they weren't. I have had a 
lot of people talk about the Arvin. And when you

20:15.353 --> 20:25.423
start asking them where they were and what they 
were doing, you find out they were with American

20:15.353 --> 20:25.423
units engaged in areas where there were no Arvin. 
Or they were looking at the Arvin militia. Arvin

20:30.548 --> 20:32.089
was just like us. He had good leaders. He had bad 
leaders. He had his callies, and he had his heroes.

20:40.575 --> 20:51.025
And at the soldier level, the Arvins were draftees 
for the most part. Some were led by competent NCOs,

20:51.045 --> 20:58.773
and some were led by absolute disasters, just as we 
had in our Army and the draftee army. Some of their

20:58.793 --> 21:04.478
officers would not have made a squad leader, and 
some were absolutely brilliant. In general, I

21:05.437 --> 21:16.232
would say that when the Arvin was properly led by 
competent officers that he had faith in, he was as

21:05.437 --> 21:16.232
tough as any soldier over there. I'll give you an 
example of that. The Arvin Marines. When the South

21:21.579 --> 21:35.157
fell, the Arvin, I say Arvin in general, meaning 
all military, the Arvin Marine Brigade and its

21:21.579 --> 21:35.157
commander went to the bush en masse. and refused to 
surrender. It took them until 1980 for the Reds to

21:37.338 --> 21:45.285
dig all those boys out of the trees. My Vietnamese 
friends in this country have shown me videotapes

21:45.305 --> 22:03.580
of convoys of Soviet and American trucks moving 
down roads in the Delta and little guys in black

21:45.305 --> 22:03.580
pajamas coming out of those woods and just 
decimating that convoy. And those little guys in

22:03.600 --> 22:05.802
black pajamas this time were pro-American. And 
these enlisted men knew that very little would

22:09.250 --> 22:12.133
happen to them. The MCOs knew that they might get 
their hands slapped. The officers knew that they

22:16.998 --> 22:21.923
would probably be shot or imprisoned. But nobody 
forced these young men to go with their officers.

22:26.288 --> 22:27.809
You know, the war was over, guys. Come on in. Yet 
they went.

22:33.895 --> 22:37.359
The point is, in general, when he was properly led, 
he was a good soldier. When he was properly led by

22:37.559 --> 22:41.183
North Vietnamese cadre, he was a damn good 
soldier. He fought tenaciously. We fought

22:42.785 --> 22:43.846
Vietnamese. So to paint the Arvin as a coward who 
ran and hid, it's not true. When he was properly

22:49.432 --> 22:52.235
led, properly trained, he was good. The problem 
was the training was sporadic, and a lot of the

22:52.816 --> 23:03.227
officers were corrupt. A lot of the officers were 
corrupt. The percentages were not as high as the

23:06.116 --> 23:09.520
American newspapers would have you believe. I've 
met very many officers out of England, and you knew

23:09.620 --> 23:16.007
they weren't corrupt. And yet, then you meet some 
young field-grade major over here who had a

23:16.027 --> 23:28.462
political rank and maybe worked in some district, 
and you couldn't get the sorry bastard out of his

23:16.027 --> 23:28.462
bunker. He would send his people out. Well, I 
wouldn't follow a leader like that either. And I

23:33.869 --> 23:39.796
wouldn't risk my life for a leader like that.

23:39.816 --> 23:42.379
Tell me about some of your relationships with the 
Vietnamese people there. In the area that I was in

23:43.300 --> 23:55.955
Pleiku, the only relationship I had with the local 
Vietnamese, as opposed to the Montagnard, were

23:43.300 --> 23:55.955
the people who were on post. And in general, I felt 
very sorry for them because of the circumstances.

24:02.388 --> 24:22.258
Having served my first military tour to Korea as a 
younger man, I had developed an affinity for

24:02.388 --> 24:22.258
picking up some languages and an empathy for the 
Oriental people, an admiration. I mean, people

24:23.179 --> 24:31.011
who can take a light bulb that you throw away and 
make a watch crystal out of it, who can take a gun

24:23.179 --> 24:31.011
barrel that you think is burned out put one man on 
it, polish it up, and have it working. I mean, these

24:33.705 --> 24:38.612
people are pretty darn good. I like the Mountain 
Yard. I really like it. I guess it was because of the

24:42.718 --> 24:48.807
tribal primitiveness of them. I mean, I felt they 
were kind of unspoiled, and I kind of watched them

24:48.827 --> 24:53.674
over the course of the war become spoiled. And I 
thought about the American Indian and how close

24:54.886 --> 25:02.440
they resembled what I had read about the American 
Indian. And I liked them. I admired those that came

25:04.003 --> 25:05.887
here. I tried to help. And I get along very well in 
the community of the Vietnamese today because of

25:08.031 --> 25:16.287
the activities and friendships I made in those 
days. Recently, my wife and I were invited to a

25:17.009 --> 25:22.456
Vietnamese wedding. It was from the former 
Vietnamese Air Force Association.

25:30.646 --> 25:39.718
Us and two others were the only Caucasian couples 
there out of 200 people. When the former

25:39.738 --> 25:45.565
Vietnamese Air Force went national recently, 
myself an Air Force Brigadier and an Air Force

25:46.945 --> 25:58.260
Colonel were invited over for the initiation and 
had some of the former leadership of South

25:46.945 --> 25:58.260
Vietnam. Not that I like them that much at the time 
and don't respect them today. With some

26:02.285 --> 26:04.949
exceptions I do, but General Key was there. I 
didn't particularly care for Key then and I don't

26:05.349 --> 26:07.853
like him now. He was one of those French trained 
types that I didn't respect, but he was a good

26:08.473 --> 26:13.881
fighter. Nobody ever called him a coward. General 
Lone, the guy that put the bullet in the spy's head,

26:16.662 --> 26:25.634
I was the guest at his table.

26:28.539 --> 26:30.862
That was on national television with this bullet. 
Maybe you'd like to hear the story behind that

26:31.302 --> 26:33.425
bullet. Okay. I asked General Lone what he would do 
different. And he said he would take the film.

26:43.359 --> 26:44.020
And... As a general officer, General Lone was not 
political. It's pretty obvious he wasn't

26:47.191 --> 26:52.419
political because he shot the man on national 
television. He was not political, but he was very

26:52.439 --> 27:04.476
well respected by the South Vietnamese because he 
was an airborne general and he came up the hard way

26:52.439 --> 27:04.476
and made no pretense of anything other than a 
combat infantryman. Now, at the time, he was in

27:04.496 --> 27:10.665
charge of the Saigon police because it was a 
military emergency. This innocent civilian,

27:12.670 --> 27:28.886
this guy in civilian clothes that got a bullet in 
the head, was a North Vietnamese Army lieutenant

27:12.670 --> 27:28.886
who had just led a unit that had just slaughtered 
the family of General Loan's aide. He had been

27:28.906 --> 27:29.627
caught. He was brought in. And they said, this is 
the one. And as General Loan said, I am a general

27:35.372 --> 27:40.197
officer authorized to conduct a summary court 
under emergency conditions, and I conducted it.

27:44.823 --> 27:50.671
And he shot the man, and that is why nobody has ever 
brought that man up on war crafts. Every military

27:51.111 --> 28:04.449
officer in the world knows that an enemy officer in 
civilian clothes who has just committed an

27:51.111 --> 28:04.449
atrocity, I'm not talking about blowing up a 
military installation. The man slaughtered a

28:04.469 --> 28:06.792
guy's family, for God's sakes.

28:09.438 --> 28:37.707
has the right to execute that individual whether 
the trial takes three days three years or three

28:09.438 --> 28:37.707
minutes is up to the convening officer and that's 
that general i'm sure that if it hadn't been his aid

28:09.438 --> 28:37.707
that the man had shot and the family of his aid that 
the man had shot then i'm sure the general would

28:09.438 --> 28:37.707
quite probably have told him to take him over and 
use a firing squad But this was such an atrocity to

28:39.357 --> 28:44.242
this general that he personally took his pistol 
and killed the man. Kind of the spur of the moment.

28:46.405 --> 28:47.346
Not spur of the moment. I'm sure he was that angry. 
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it may have been spur of the moment,

28:50.709 --> 28:53.352
but he wasn't political. It was within his right. 
He executed a spy. Now, whether he pulled the

28:56.616 --> 29:02.763
trigger himself or had it done by 12 good men tried 
and true over here is not the point. He had the

29:02.863 --> 29:03.904
authority. He exercised that authority. That's 
why he's never been brought up as a war criminal.

29:08.146 --> 29:11.771
And you've never heard an outcry other than the 
political press. There's never been a formal

29:11.791 --> 29:16.838
diplomatic or military outcry for that man to be 
court-martialed. And he was left in this country.

29:19.742 --> 29:21.244
Getting a little low on tape, we'll turn it over. 
Okay, let's just change it up a little bit and talk

29:21.524 --> 29:26.110
about chemical weapons. Okay. I know you work with 
chemical weapons now. I work with Defense Against

29:31.137 --> 29:33.300
Chemical Weapons. Defense Against Chemical 
Weapons. Okay. You know something about them. Why

29:37.205 --> 29:37.866
don't you... Tell me about some different types of 
chemicals used in Vietnam and what the purposes

29:38.369 --> 29:43.414
were. Well, we'd first off have to define 
chemical, but if you consider napalm a chemical,

29:43.434 --> 29:52.104
that was used on occasion, used in flamethrowers 
also. By the way, the North Vietnamese had good

29:52.564 --> 29:54.687
flamethrowers. They cooked a bunch of villagers 
just south of my base one time.

30:01.194 --> 30:07.060
They didn't have the planes down there to deliver 
the napalm, but an individual spraying it kills

30:01.194 --> 30:07.060
them just as dead, maybe not as many. But getting 
into the chemicals, CS gas mostly, kind of a

30:08.255 --> 30:19.290
powerful tear gas. They used it, we used it. The 
other chemical we used was at that time called

30:22.794 --> 30:29.403
defoliant, and I heard the term Agent Orange 
between tours. First tour when we had it, it was

30:29.423 --> 30:31.866
simply called defoliant. It had an orange thing on 
top of the barrel, so that's where it got its name.

30:38.596 --> 30:39.917
We weren't trained in its use. We were told to put it 
in these tanks and go out and spray it on the trees

30:40.037 --> 30:46.183
around the fire bases and clear the fire bases. 
Now, the Air Force Ranch Hand Program was clear in

30:46.223 --> 30:48.566
the jungle. We were just clearing 500-meter 
strips around fire bases with it. Basically, a

30:53.110 --> 30:58.916
mixture of 2,4-D and 2,4-5-T, which is used in our 
rice country. 2,4-D is used, 2,4-5-T, but they're

31:00.597 --> 31:04.021
not used full strength. The problem is in the 
manufacture of this agent during the war, they

31:09.443 --> 31:12.906
left out a key quality control step. As they were 
running it through, the process dioxin buildup

31:12.926 --> 31:19.393
occurs. And the dioxin could be as small as five 
parts per billion. Or in some cases, they've

31:27.380 --> 31:30.944
analyzed barrels of it and found it as high. And 
this is not generally published, to my knowledge,

31:31.104 --> 31:35.248
168 parts per million. which means it's extremely 
toxic. And because of the shoddy quality control

31:39.027 --> 32:01.641
done by the chemical manufacturer and the United 
States government, we sprayed a poison that had

31:39.027 --> 32:01.641
been considered safe when it was used as 2,4-D and 
2,4-5-T. Because in the manufacturing process

31:39.027 --> 32:01.641
for the government, they left out those quality 
control steps that allowed the dioxin buildup.

32:02.566 --> 32:05.951
Dioxin is one of the byproducts of this 
manufacturer, as I understand it. I'm not

32:05.991 --> 32:07.413
completely familiar with that. But that 
particular piece was shoddy manufacturing

32:08.375 --> 32:13.122
processes. And as a result, no one really thought 
it was that harmful. But one of us always wore a gas

32:17.488 --> 32:24.018
mask when we were spraying it, just in case the tank 
was ruptured and the stuff came around. And I've

32:24.158 --> 32:28.866
seen it come, you know, take the paint off the tail 
boom of my helicopter. And I've come back with My

32:31.827 --> 32:39.537
uniform saturated with the stuff because we flew 
with the doors open and the windows open and stuff

32:31.827 --> 32:39.537
like that when we were dropping, so you'd fly back 
through your own mist a lot of times. We would empty

32:40.458 --> 32:54.797
that same container, put spray in it, DDT, and go 
spray the troops for mosquito control. We were our

32:55.418 --> 33:00.484
own worst enemies in chemical warfare there 
because we sprayed our own troops. We never

33:00.504 --> 33:01.665
sprayed Charlie. Occasionally, if we had any 
left, we would go out and spray Charlie's rice

33:01.866 --> 33:24.092
crop, where the intelligence officer had told us 
to, but that was about two or three missions, and we

33:01.866 --> 33:24.092
found we were getting fired at so bad, and we had 
slicks at the time, not gunships, we carried these

33:01.866 --> 33:24.092
tanks in, that we told the chemical officer and the 
intelligence officer that if they wanted that

33:01.866 --> 33:24.092
damn stuff dropped, on those farms out there, then 
they were going to have to provide gunship escort

33:24.713 --> 33:29.799
because those farmers didn't want their rice 
crops to break. And so we didn't go do that very

33:31.581 --> 33:34.905
often after that.

33:39.310 --> 33:47.259
Chemicals, I had several experiences with tear 
gas, ours and theirs, ours being some of our troops

33:39.310 --> 33:47.259
would toss tear gas. We had tear gas in the 
perimeter. Lightning would hit during the

33:50.863 --> 33:53.826
monsoon. and set off several containers of tear 
gas, or these containers would fire tear gas out.

34:03.070 --> 34:03.931
Those would go off. Several claymore mines would 
go off. Occasionally, a thing called fugas, which

34:05.774 --> 34:09.459
is a napalm mixture, would go off. Now, the other 
chemical agent that was used was phosphorus,

34:10.080 --> 34:14.106
white phosphorus. Used them as smoke shells to 
mark artillery rounds. That's what we used for

34:19.153 --> 34:20.235
spotter. And God help the poor son of a gun that got 
phosphorus on him. If our artillery was accurate

34:23.464 --> 34:28.031
on him at the first round, then he really got hurt. 
As far as this chemical warfare of germ warfare

34:30.375 --> 34:43.817
agents, as far as chemical warfare in the terms of 
poison gases, those were not used, at least not to

34:30.375 --> 34:43.817
my knowledge. And I've never found anyone who 
knows they were. That goes back to the Korean War.

34:49.426 --> 34:53.610
when the Chinese sanitary conditions were 
causing such tremendous losses among their

34:49.426 --> 34:53.610
forces. Their propaganda was, it's not us that's 
doing it. It's the germ warfare of the Americans

34:59.156 --> 35:03.080
and the chemical warfare of the Americans. The 
people who've used chemical warfare, I'm talking

35:04.141 --> 35:11.229
about lethal agents, have been the Soviets. Our 
army is still to this day not geared to do it. That's

35:14.772 --> 35:18.336
why I'm working to try to build a defense for it. You 
don't use the stuff if you can't defend yourself

35:19.227 --> 35:24.252
against it, your own stuff. But the Soviet army has 
always been able to do that, and all of their

35:24.272 --> 35:29.797
surrogate states have, and as a result, around the 
world. Since 1963 in Yemen, with the Soviet

35:30.598 --> 35:39.946
surrogates of the day, Egypt, they've used lethal 
agents, primarily mustard and carbon. That's

35:40.066 --> 35:42.789
blister gas and nerve gas. So that's the sum total 
of my chemical warfare. In Vietnam, we used tear

35:48.488 --> 35:50.130
gas a lot. We would use tear gas to run them out of 
caves. We would use tear gas to flush them out of

35:53.375 --> 35:59.863
villages and bunkers near villages. And to me, 
using tear gas on a village to flush people out and

36:01.405 --> 36:11.919
try to catch them is a lot more humane than going in 
and putting napalm on the whole damn village.

36:13.201 --> 36:17.567
Because sooner or later, you've got to make a 
decision of how many more men are going to die

36:13.201 --> 36:17.567
because of that machine gun nest. When that 
decision's made, you're going to take out that

36:19.184 --> 36:24.091
machine gun nest or you're going to quit that pipe, 
one of the two. Were the benefits of using

36:26.274 --> 36:28.958
chemicals that great in Vietnam? I mean, looking 
back on it now compared to the past. Looking back on

36:30.660 --> 36:37.270
it, I ended up with soft tissue tumor, as you well 
know, and I laid a lot of it back to the dioxin. But I

36:37.290 --> 36:39.673
think We started using it, well, the high command, 
I'm sure, started using defoliants to defoliate

36:41.813 --> 36:50.584
problem areas that they would take tremendous 
casualties in. The Iron Triangle was practically

36:51.445 --> 36:53.748
all defoliated. That was the Ranch Hand Project. 
They went in after that and used their own plows to

36:55.751 --> 37:05.544
knock down the sticks because these were hiding 
places for the enemy units that were threatening

36:55.751 --> 37:05.544
Saigon. In our area where it was used, it was used to 
clear... areas around the fire bases. And this

37:13.524 --> 37:16.788
wasn't used around every fire base, depending on 
how long they planned to stay there. Around Chia

37:16.808 --> 37:22.276
Rio, for instance, is where I used a lot of it to 
clear two or three places around Chia Rio. And it

37:23.417 --> 37:27.022
was very effective. It meant that that unit had a 
clear field where they could have some hope of

37:27.283 --> 37:33.251
seeing. You have to understand the North 
Vietnamese soldier was a very good jungle

37:33.872 --> 37:38.398
fighter. By that I mean he was a master at 
camouflage. He lived in that damn jungle and our

37:43.559 --> 37:46.123
people didn't. And he could move through that 
jungle very quietly, very patiently when he

37:47.665 --> 37:51.530
wanted to. And so with our policy of building these 
little fire bases, miniature forts, The

37:59.303 --> 38:07.162
perimeter of that fort quotes or the outpost 50 
meters away was the outer line of defense. And if

38:07.182 --> 38:17.667
that outer line of defense, if you've only cleaned 
out that one area and your outer line of defense now

38:07.182 --> 38:17.667
stops at brush and scrub 20 and 30 feet high. You've 
left an area there where you have an entire

38:18.727 --> 38:24.215
regiment crawl upon you before you even know 
they're there. So we cleared these fields of fire,

38:24.636 --> 38:28.241
these areas around the bases. And so I think it was 
very good. I blame our own people, whether they are

38:30.144 --> 38:42.363
engineers in the chemical companies or whether 
they are purchasing people in the US government

38:30.144 --> 38:42.363
for allowing the dioxin buildup. They never 
allowed that combination to go to the commercial

38:47.887 --> 38:56.416
farmer without checking that step in the quality 
control process yet, just because they were going

38:47.887 --> 38:56.416
to drop it on the enemy in the jungle. They never 
made that check. And the dioxin buildup is causing

39:00.099 --> 39:04.984
casualties to this day in some people, I believe.

39:09.849 --> 39:10.410
OK.

39:13.353 --> 39:14.554
I'm going to switch the tone again. What do you 
think of Johnson's? Johnson's campaign after 64

39:18.093 --> 39:44.640
for 64 we had a saying and we laughed about it in 
Vietnam you have to understand I was in the

39:18.093 --> 39:44.640
military and I voted for Goldwater at that time but 
the saying was you know if you if you vote for

39:18.093 --> 39:44.640
Goldwater you'll be at war in six months and once we 
got to Vietnam the guy said you know They told me if I

39:45.177 --> 39:48.640
voted for Goldwater, I was going to be at war in six 
months. By God, I voted for Goldwater, and here I

39:48.660 --> 39:51.183
am. They were right. So I didn't like Johnson. I 
didn't like Johnson's

39:54.606 --> 40:01.992
talking down to the American people when he was 
addressing them. I felt Vietnam was necessary in

40:02.012 --> 40:05.215
the beginning. I didn't like the way the war was 
being conducted. By that I mean no wind policy uh

40:14.202 --> 40:38.387
the the restrictions on firing i can understand 
the initial restrictions but the bombing halls

40:14.202 --> 40:38.387
the the slow build up build up give them a chance to 
respond instead of coming in there with a massive

40:14.202 --> 40:38.387
uh and i don't mean commit the entire american 
population but enough firepower in the right

40:14.202 --> 40:38.387
places to do the job the damn targets for the Air 
Force was being picked in Washington and it was

40:39.110 --> 41:06.248
being picked as much on political grounds as 
military grounds and to risk the lives of all of

40:39.110 --> 41:06.248
those hundreds and thousands of young men for 
political targets, meaning go out and bomb rice

40:39.110 --> 41:06.248
paddies instead of bombing the dikes and knocking 
out their agricultural economy, bombing their

40:39.110 --> 41:06.248
ports and closing that off and bringing that war to 
a halt rather quickly.

41:07.477 --> 41:15.729
They dragged it out because they were, quote, 
afraid of the Soviet Union might intervene,

41:07.477 --> 41:15.729
afraid that China might intervene. Feathers. We 
knew at the time their economies wouldn't stand

41:17.051 --> 41:19.876
it. They had proven to us three years earlier at the 
Bay of Pig, or correction, at the Cuban crisis.

41:27.487 --> 41:29.350
They didn't want a major war with the United 
States. And as long as we didn't invade the North

41:31.490 --> 41:39.681
and try to occupy the North, but only prevent the 
North from taking over the South, it would have

41:31.490 --> 41:39.681
been status quo. Johnson's lack of political will 
and leadership, I'm convinced, doomed 55,000

41:40.803 --> 41:56.864
Americans to die and close to half a million to be 
wounded because the war dragged out so long.

41:56.884 --> 41:58.206
People say that it was... It was Johnson's 
personal war. What do you think of that? Well, it

42:00.745 --> 42:02.867
was being directed for the most part. I think he had 
delusions of being a Churchill the way he had his,

42:02.927 --> 42:10.817
from what I can understand, his bunker set up under 
the White House there with his little war

42:02.927 --> 42:10.817
situation room. I don't know this.

42:15.743 --> 42:21.730
But when those kind of decisions are made, And they 
still commit Americans. Or we would effectively

42:23.880 --> 42:27.166
stop the enemy flow of supplies. Allow the 
interdiction. Stop the flow of supplies. And then

42:32.715 --> 42:34.818
the North would say, we'd like to talk. We'd stop 
our bombing. They'd build up their supplies. Then

42:37.783 --> 42:38.805
they'd go back to fighting. We'd start bombing 
again. We'd like to talk. About the second time

42:41.429 --> 42:44.194
they did that, he should have said, OK, talk. But he 
should have kept bombing. He didn't. I blame

42:47.630 --> 42:48.732
McNamara. McNamara almost decimated the officer 
corps of the United States. The high ranking

42:52.477 --> 43:00.449
officers who were good leaders were replaced, 
forced to resign during the course of that war. The

43:02.973 --> 43:06.578
Westmoreland, I don't have a lot of respect for 
Westmoreland. I like the man. I guess I've heard

43:07.880 --> 43:09.522
him speak. He seemed like a nice individual. He did 
not have the military guts to stand up, resign, and

43:11.706 --> 43:16.793
go public. He had the likes of McNamara, who admits 
he had made his decision in 67 that the war was

43:17.853 --> 43:26.321
unwinnable, yet he didn't quit in 67. He didn't 
even attempt to win it or to notify the people to

43:28.423 --> 43:32.287
back down. He kept acquiescing.

43:36.031 --> 43:42.577
His lack of political will, Wes Moreland's lack of 
it, I was very disappointed in that. Let's flip the

43:42.597 --> 43:43.658
tape over here.
