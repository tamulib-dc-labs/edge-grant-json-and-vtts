WEBVTT

00:02.326 --> 00:04.888
Having rural backgrounds, yes, absolutely.

00:05.609 --> 00:13.156
And what did most of them, large or small animal, do you remember where there was much difference in there?

00:14.757 --> 00:31.152
Surprisingly, over the years, the tendency not only in my class but in veterinarians in general is to gravitate towards small animal medicine, the reason being numerous.

00:31.587 --> 00:34.595
The income is always much better in small animal medicine.

00:35.277 --> 00:38.486
The hazards of the practice are much less in small animal medicine.

00:38.526 --> 00:41.274
But was that true of their goals at that time?

00:41.715 --> 00:46.288
Was that true, at that time did they, was that what they hoped to do?

00:46.690 --> 00:48.092
When you all were in vet school?

00:48.112 --> 00:48.493
Oh, no.

00:48.753 --> 00:49.975
That's what I was... No, no.

00:50.576 --> 00:52.940
I was going to be a large animal practitioner.

00:53.721 --> 00:57.688
Was that the... And most of all of us were going to be large animal veterinarians.

00:57.728 --> 00:59.130
That's what I thought, yeah.

00:59.691 --> 01:00.292
Absolutely.

01:01.334 --> 01:10.429
In fact, in 1960, you think back about it.

01:11.350 --> 01:13.153
How many people treated

01:14.078 --> 01:16.422
their dog and their cat like a child.

01:17.464 --> 01:17.985
How true.

01:18.125 --> 01:19.107
Compared with today.

01:19.187 --> 01:19.808
How true.

01:19.828 --> 01:20.790
We've got four of them.

01:20.890 --> 01:21.511
Sure, sure.

01:21.612 --> 01:22.072
Right here.

01:22.273 --> 01:22.513
Sure.

01:22.934 --> 01:27.082
In 1960, I didn't know of any of them.

01:27.102 --> 01:30.949
That's the evolution that has taken place in that 40 years.

01:31.610 --> 01:38.382
And I presume you could not generalize about urban kids

01:39.155 --> 01:45.307
being small animal and rural kids being large animal, I presume there wasn't much difference in that.

01:45.327 --> 01:45.507
No.

01:46.629 --> 01:50.877
Even today, a lot of the urban kids go into large animal medicine.

01:50.897 --> 01:52.320
Not knowing maybe what they're

01:52.688 --> 01:56.395
Well, even most of them, though, want to go into horse work.

01:56.776 --> 02:10.602
See, in the suburbs, they can own a horse or two and be involved in it, and a lot of them want to go into equine work, and you can make a good living in the right situation.

02:10.622 --> 02:13.167
Did we have the Louisiana contract at that time?

02:13.247 --> 02:13.768
Yes.

02:13.748 --> 02:16.992
And how, were those students accepted and part of the group?

02:17.012 --> 02:17.613
Oh, yes.

02:17.633 --> 02:22.058
I believe that nine of our 64 were from Louisiana.

02:23.460 --> 02:35.875
And were, and you said there were social events and was there good, for, for the married student, was there good student faculty contact out of class?

02:36.293 --> 02:38.015
if you wanted to talk to somebody.

02:38.235 --> 02:38.856
Oh, absolutely.

02:39.256 --> 02:43.041
Did you develop a close advisor friend?

02:43.601 --> 02:49.828
Dr. John Meliff was my closest advisor.

02:50.229 --> 02:56.876
See, he taught neurology, and I was trying to learn to be one, and so I spent a lot of time with Dr. John.

02:57.277 --> 03:02.763
Do you remember any basic advice about veterinary medicine that he may have given you?

03:03.804 --> 03:05.406
Any guidelines or?

03:06.179 --> 03:15.672
I think Dr. John taught you how to teach veterinary medicine with class.

03:19.518 --> 03:24.886
He was a real role model for young faculty like myself.

03:25.927 --> 03:31.795
Everybody looked up to him and respected him because of the way he did his job.

03:33.197 --> 03:35.140
And the whole community looked up to him.

03:35.305 --> 03:43.775
If there had been a vote of the graduating class to select their favorite veterinary faculty member, do you think he might have been there?

03:43.795 --> 03:44.336
Probably.

03:45.077 --> 03:45.637
I do.

03:45.677 --> 03:47.159
Yes.

03:48.140 --> 03:53.166
And let's see, was there any course that you thought of as just a fun course?

03:53.447 --> 03:54.768
I'm not saying it's easy or anything.

03:55.289 --> 03:57.111
That was one just more enjoyable?

04:11.080 --> 04:12.402
I don't think so.

04:13.603 --> 04:20.312
I took them all on with great enthusiasm.

04:21.153 --> 04:31.226
I wanted to digest all of it as well as I could, and I think I enjoyed all of them, honestly, even biochemistry.

04:31.907 --> 04:39.096
And it helped to have Benny Camp as a teacher.

04:39.650 --> 04:42.975
I'm glad to see Benny still walking around looking halfway healthy.

04:45.198 --> 04:47.802
Benny's always an inspiration.

04:47.863 --> 04:50.447
He's such a gentle sort of person.

04:51.428 --> 05:06.070
All right, as you approached commencement time as a DVM, how well prepared did you feel to go out into the real world of veterinary practice?

05:06.090 --> 05:07.092
Well,

05:11.594 --> 05:14.418
Approaching it, I felt wonderful.

05:16.501 --> 05:19.485
I passed the state and national boards with flying colors.

05:19.605 --> 05:23.931
I thought I knew everything they'd thrown at me.

05:24.011 --> 05:27.316
I had all of my books and notes and materials to take with me.

05:28.397 --> 05:30.340
And then I went out there and then I changed my mind.

05:35.047 --> 05:41.095
Now, I'm assuming that one of the advantages you had was that you were a little older and a little more mature.

05:41.716 --> 05:44.458
I hope both of those were applicable.

05:45.900 --> 05:57.069
That those of you that had been out of the undergraduate program a little, a few years, did it, did you all make it through a little better than those who came straight from there?

05:58.070 --> 06:02.194
Because in those days, couldn't you go two and then two years of pre-vent?

06:02.794 --> 06:03.035
Yes.

06:04.356 --> 06:08.419
All right, veterinary commencement.

06:08.499 --> 06:11.622
Describe it, when you graduated and got that second degree.

06:17.305 --> 06:18.527
Well, what can I say?

06:18.547 --> 06:27.663
You know, there's only certain words you can use to describe the elation that you feel.

06:29.346 --> 06:34.875
It's a combination of elation and relief.

06:36.277 --> 06:38.942
And let me carry that a little further.

06:42.078 --> 06:47.644
Graduation for us was in January because of the trimester switch in.

06:49.687 --> 07:02.241
During the Christmas holidays, I had bought a home in Palestine, decided to go back to practice there where I'd been an assistant county agent, and I had moved my family up there.

07:04.604 --> 07:11.612
And then, after graduation, I loaded what else I had

07:13.837 --> 07:38.370
in my car, and I remember driving down University Drive toward Texas Avenue, and as I turned left on Texas Avenue, heading up to 21 to go to college to Palestine, I looked over my left shoulder at the campus, and I said, Goodbye forever.

07:42.495 --> 07:42.856
That's a good one.

07:42.876 --> 07:43.236
That's a good one.

07:44.077 --> 07:44.798
forever.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.282
Forever lasted three years.

07:50.444 --> 07:54.428
Did you, you began your own practice or did you join somebody?

07:55.369 --> 08:04.740
I had made arrangements to go into practice with the fellow that I spoke to you about before and I went up there.

08:04.900 --> 08:07.102
He and his brother-in-law were in practice together.

08:07.142 --> 08:12.328
They had a general mixed practice, did a lot of large animal work, but I was

08:12.578 --> 08:14.120
quickly disillusioned.

08:15.622 --> 08:40.358
I'm, I'm not a purist but I'm, I try to do things as best as I'm able to do and I was disappointed in the way that one of the two practiced medicine in fact to the point that I couldn't tolerate it and I said I, that helped encourage you to, I went across town and

08:41.165 --> 08:45.690
and set up my own practice and practiced for three more years by myself.

08:46.712 --> 08:57.444
And I learned that practicing veterinary medicine as a solo practitioner means that you're married to your work, not to your family.

08:58.566 --> 09:01.309
They use you up completely.

09:01.789 --> 09:05.994
For three years, I didn't see my children play little league ball.

09:06.175 --> 09:08.978
I worked seven days a week basically.

09:09.734 --> 09:15.304
I tried to get to church on Sunday, made it some of the time, some of the time I didn't.

09:16.847 --> 09:22.899
And I finally said, this is not the way to raise your children.

09:25.443 --> 09:29.872
And let me tell you what made me call Dr. Elliott and ask him if that job was open.

09:30.673 --> 09:31.675
It was my barber.

09:34.591 --> 09:45.843
On a Saturday night, I finally got home about 7.30, and I was eating supper by myself, and the phone rang, and it's my barber.

09:47.164 --> 09:52.289
He said, my little daughter's puppy is sick.

09:52.389 --> 09:53.751
Could you look at it?

09:54.972 --> 09:56.273
Sure, meet me over at the clinic.

09:57.274 --> 10:01.999
So, I woofed down the rest of my food, drove over there and met him,

10:05.590 --> 10:08.916
By the way, haircuts were 75 cents.

10:10.278 --> 10:15.166
This was 1967, 75 cents for a haircut, at least in his shop.

10:17.651 --> 10:24.823
Brought the little eight-year-old girl in with a little puppy, obviously had to stimp her because he hadn't had it vaccinated.

10:27.107 --> 10:30.653
Snotty nose fever and, you know, the whole nine yards and

10:31.274 --> 10:39.786
I said, you know, we're dealing with a viral infection that may or may not kill the dog, has a better chance of killing it than not, so all I can do is treat it symptomatically.

10:40.887 --> 10:46.996
I gathered up medication, put it in a sack, and handed it to the little girl, and he said, how much is the bill?

10:47.036 --> 10:58.311
And I figured it out, and I distinctly remember to this day, I'll never forget it, the bill was $8 for an emergency call at 8.30 on Saturday night,

10:58.932 --> 11:00.073
all these medications.

11:00.214 --> 11:01.715
Eight dollars, okay.

11:03.518 --> 11:05.500
The barber had a stroke.

11:07.182 --> 11:08.183
He started cursing.

11:10.246 --> 11:11.027
I was a thief.

11:14.511 --> 11:20.438
He pulled his billfold out, got a five dollar bill out and threw it on the floor.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.842
He said, that's all you get.

11:24.823 --> 11:27.066
And he stomped out the door and left his daughter in.

11:27.670 --> 11:28.871
the examiner room with me.

11:30.553 --> 11:31.735
So I talked to his little girl.

11:31.795 --> 11:33.176
She was crying, of course.

11:34.998 --> 11:42.147
I told her how to give the medicine, when to give it, and everything, and to call me if things didn't go well.

11:43.989 --> 11:45.050
And I took her by the hand.

11:45.090 --> 11:46.312
She was carrying a little dog.

11:47.012 --> 11:48.054
I took her out and put her in.

11:48.694 --> 11:49.856
He was driving a little truck.

11:50.837 --> 11:51.838
I walked around the front.

11:53.438 --> 11:57.103
I handed him his $5 bill, and I said, I've forgotten his name.

11:57.143 --> 11:58.084
I don't even want to know it.

11:58.125 --> 12:00.027
I said, here's your money.

12:00.047 --> 12:00.888
You don't owe me a thing.

12:01.669 --> 12:04.133
I said, I just don't ever want to see you again.

12:06.116 --> 12:06.376
Bye.

12:07.678 --> 12:09.120
And that's when I called Ned Elliott.

12:09.180 --> 12:11.083
I said, this ain't no way to live a life.

12:12.725 --> 12:13.065
That's right.

12:14.027 --> 12:18.653
Some summarization questions now on what we've got left.

12:21.046 --> 12:26.916
put together all of these A&M years and what it has meant to you.

12:26.956 --> 12:28.939
You said responsibility a while ago.

12:28.959 --> 12:35.491
Any other general things that you think came out of your A&M experience that have been important to you?

12:36.432 --> 12:41.781
Well, Dr. Monroe, I don't have enough time to say all of the things that I've got out of my A&M experience.

12:42.663 --> 12:45.147
A&M has been my life.

12:46.190 --> 12:51.957
You know, I don't want to say, well, A&M is first and God is second and family is third.

12:51.977 --> 12:53.939
A&M has been my life.

12:55.061 --> 13:05.073
Everything that I am as a professional is due to A&M.

13:06.995 --> 13:16.146
Not only what I have learned technically in my career, but what I have learned about relationships between people

13:16.784 --> 13:19.468
what I've learned about leadership, teaching.

13:20.931 --> 13:29.725
A&M is my life and my family and my God and all of us are a big family together.

13:33.771 --> 13:39.180
I get tears in my eyes just watching the band march in.

13:41.607 --> 13:47.355
So you think that line in the song is correct, there is a spirit that can never be told?

13:47.375 --> 13:47.815
Absolutely.

13:49.117 --> 13:49.798
Yes, sir.

13:50.699 --> 13:51.660
I think I agree with you.

13:52.241 --> 13:55.165
And my wife is a wonderful adopted Aggie.

13:55.746 --> 13:56.887
She feels the same way.

13:57.227 --> 13:59.971
She's a Saul Ross graduate.

13:59.991 --> 14:00.051
Oh.

14:00.071 --> 14:00.792
All right.

14:01.153 --> 14:06.079
If you were a consultant today brought in to advise A&M,

14:07.392 --> 14:15.929
First of all, about the undergraduate experiences, what advice would you give A&M's leadership about we're going to do undergraduate and then vet school?

14:16.811 --> 14:24.988
You're the consultant and you're advising them on what they should do now and in the future to keep A&M what it ought to be.

14:25.970 --> 14:27.072
What advice would you give them?

14:28.604 --> 14:44.520
Well, first I would say that I'm not patting myself on the back saying that I know any more than anybody else is, but I know what I think of A&M and I know what it's done for me and I have watched it for a long time.

14:44.872 --> 14:48.959
And I know that A&M is basically good.

14:50.361 --> 15:03.544
It provides a good environment for good people to come together to learn how to make a living and how to relate to people.

15:07.570 --> 15:10.255
My goodness, fine tune.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.383
Learn how to deal with the numbers.

15:12.403 --> 15:14.226
44,000, where do you stop?

15:16.510 --> 15:19.374
Learn how to find places for them to park.

15:20.837 --> 15:21.718
Just fine-tune.

15:23.421 --> 15:36.242
One of the big criticisms I've had is please don't let every ladder climbing administrator that passes through College Station

15:39.192 --> 15:41.234
try to tear it down and remake it his way.

15:41.915 --> 15:43.356
Please don't let that happen.

15:43.376 --> 15:49.141
And please quit saying that hiring our own graduates is bad.

15:49.201 --> 15:51.724
Hiring too many of them is bad.

15:52.845 --> 15:53.665
I agree with that.

15:54.086 --> 15:56.448
Hiring our own graduates is not bad.

15:56.488 --> 15:58.290
It's which ones we hire.

15:58.570 --> 16:07.258
Man, it does such a wonderful job of holding the rest of us together until we learn how to be one of us.

16:08.875 --> 16:19.144
having that sense of ownership, that loyalty, that esprit de corps, that love for, you can't buy it with a ladder climber.

16:19.465 --> 16:20.746
I'm not being critical of them.

16:21.086 --> 16:22.567
They are good for us too.

16:23.388 --> 16:25.770
Just quit saying we shouldn't hire our own.

16:26.231 --> 16:29.354
We should hire some of our own because they're good people too.

16:30.395 --> 16:38.562
Now that you're the consultant to the vet school, what would you advise the leadership there to do, not to do?

16:39.335 --> 16:47.464
Well, I'm full of it, of course, as far as advice, and I don't want to be gentle in the way that I tell Richard Adams how to do his job.

16:47.504 --> 16:53.270
I'm not going to do that, of course, but I'm going to nudge him a little, and I already have, and I respect him.

16:53.911 --> 16:55.693
He earned the job and he are one of us.

16:55.733 --> 16:56.334
He's an Aggie.

17:00.819 --> 17:03.081
The things that bother me

17:03.972 --> 17:19.807
about the vet school and about any other part of the campus relative to faculty is when we began to allow other things than teaching to be priority one.

17:23.330 --> 17:25.693
I'm not with you on that, what you mean there.

17:27.094 --> 17:29.156
Other things other than teaching.

17:29.196 --> 17:30.317
Is that what you're saying?

17:30.567 --> 17:34.113
things other than teaching to be priority number one.

17:34.194 --> 17:34.915
Oh, I'm with you now.

17:34.935 --> 17:36.137
Basically, research.

17:36.498 --> 17:51.124
I'm not criticizing research, I believe in it 100%, but Dr. Shattuck, please don't stand up in front of our people and say,

17:52.538 --> 17:55.222
our best researchers make our best teachers.

17:55.843 --> 17:56.945
Please don't say that.

17:57.766 --> 17:58.708
Ain't necessarily true.

17:58.888 --> 18:00.311
That ain't necessarily true.

18:00.611 --> 18:04.237
It might be true, but it ain't in general true.

18:05.479 --> 18:08.384
Just as our best clinicians don't make the best teachers.

18:10.827 --> 18:17.398
Don't make the researcher out to be the epitome of what teaching is about.

18:18.425 --> 18:37.649
Put things in perspective and use those good researchers that are also good teachers and don't bring a researcher in like Dr. My goodness, world-renowned researcher over there in the vet school.

18:37.669 --> 18:38.330
One of those blanks.

18:41.194 --> 18:45.259
Don't bring him in the classroom to teach clinical medicine.

18:45.897 --> 18:50.663
Bring him in the classroom to inform the students of what's going on in the research lab.

18:52.025 --> 18:54.348
Utilize what he's got in the right way.

18:55.429 --> 19:01.276
Don't bring him into the classroom to teach something that is three miles over the students' heads.

19:01.497 --> 19:02.979
I see that way too often.

19:05.201 --> 19:09.627
In terms of the comparative curriculum,

19:11.075 --> 19:18.462
of the vet school today and the comparative number of students admitted, are we about on target, you think, today?

19:21.004 --> 19:22.105
Say that one more time.

19:22.305 --> 19:26.789
Is the curriculum in the vet school today about appropriate for veterinary medicine today?

19:29.211 --> 19:34.556
I have been retired since August the 31st, 1995, going on six years.

19:34.616 --> 19:40.141
The curriculum is forever changing.

19:40.402 --> 19:40.862
Oh, okay.

19:41.332 --> 19:46.821
It is hard for me to sit here today and tell you that it is appropriate for the times.

19:47.542 --> 19:52.911
I want to say that my goodness if it's not, heaven forbid.

19:52.971 --> 20:06.293
I think in general the vet school stays up to date and appropriate with what they present to those students over there.

20:07.268 --> 20:13.435
All right, and in terms of admitting 128 or whatever it is, do you think that's probably an appropriate size for?

20:15.378 --> 20:32.398
Yes, there's one thing that relative to numbers of graduates, be it physicians, lawyers, or veterinarians or what have you, back in the early 80s when the economy was not very good, spokespersons for the TVMA, I'm ashamed to say,

20:32.564 --> 20:39.413
stood right up at one of the conventions and said, we must do something about the numbers of graduates that we're producing.

20:39.913 --> 20:41.455
We need to cut back on them.

20:43.158 --> 20:47.123
And I want to tell you there's nothing that makes my blood boil more than that.

20:47.744 --> 20:57.156
You mean you want us to not allow these bright young people to pursue an education in veterinary medicine so you can make more money?

20:57.456 --> 20:58.538
I don't believe in that.

20:59.339 --> 20:59.759
I think I'm agreeing.

20:59.779 --> 21:01.221
And I never will.

21:01.657 --> 21:06.523
128, sure, we're going to have 20 million people in this, probably already do.

21:06.623 --> 21:14.913
128 have been graduated every year now for, gosh, now only 20 years or better.

21:17.116 --> 21:18.778
Okay, getting ready to end.

21:19.879 --> 21:31.393
If you, if somebody walked up to you and handed you a check for a million dollars with one condition, you have to pass it on to Texas A&M, but you've got to decide the use that will be made of that gift.

21:32.352 --> 21:37.838
If you could make a big gift to Texas A&M, for what purpose would you want that money used?

21:40.561 --> 21:41.222
You can decide it.

21:49.010 --> 21:51.753
A million dollars is not much money these days, as you know.

21:54.356 --> 22:00.503
It wouldn't build a very big parking lot and it wouldn't help with faculty salaries.

22:03.149 --> 22:14.411
I would want the money to go where it could be, its use could be appreciated by the students.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.441
Honestly, I think the faculty are paid well enough.

22:20.423 --> 22:23.048
I was always paid more than I was worth.

22:23.737 --> 22:36.554
and by the way the starting salary in 1967 was $10,000 a year for a 12-month appointment working seven days a week and hoping you could get off for Christmas and Thanksgiving and I was happy with it and have been ever since.

22:36.874 --> 22:44.504
I worked there 28 and a half years and when I quit I was making close to $80,000 a year which was more than I needed honestly.

22:45.385 --> 22:51.533
I would want the money to go to benefit the students.

22:53.588 --> 22:56.031
Scholarships or?

22:56.051 --> 22:57.893
Scholarships would be wonderful.

22:58.173 --> 23:05.801
How would you select the recipients?

23:05.821 --> 23:12.789
I would select the recipients based on evidence of responsibility.

23:16.013 --> 23:16.213
Okay.

23:16.233 --> 23:19.917
Evidence of responsibility is their track record that they've already made.

23:22.208 --> 23:27.453
Okay, in my questions, I'm now, unless we've left something out, next to the last question.

23:28.414 --> 23:43.609
To what people connected with Texas A&M, be they students, former students, faculty or what, to what A&M related people do you feel the greatest gratitude in terms of what it's meant to your life?

23:48.414 --> 23:49.735
To whom are you the most grateful?

24:04.278 --> 24:06.561
You're saying a group of people, not an individual.

24:06.601 --> 24:07.382
No, no, no.

24:07.823 --> 24:08.704
What individuals?

24:11.347 --> 24:11.788
Earl Rudder.

24:12.929 --> 24:13.750
Does that surprise you?

24:15.252 --> 24:20.679
Yeah, because I didn't know that you had any relation with him, personally.

24:20.699 --> 24:22.561
I have a tremendous relationship with him.

24:24.464 --> 24:25.866
He was, he was my boss.

24:26.326 --> 24:27.548
Okay, all right.

24:27.568 --> 24:29.791
He was my World War II hero.

24:30.071 --> 24:31.553
Okay.

24:31.573 --> 24:33.255
He's my fellow Aggie.

24:34.163 --> 24:38.687
He's one of my heroes.

24:39.048 --> 24:42.071
Who else that you're grateful to?

24:46.735 --> 24:59.668
I'm always grateful to Ray George for helping me out with a scholarship, giving me a chance, giving me a second chance when I goofed up, being a gentleman and a good role model for young people.

25:03.692 --> 25:04.052
There's

25:04.555 --> 25:07.798
Many, many, many, my goodness, many, many, many, many.

25:09.119 --> 25:16.747
The Aggie family is large and it's chock full of wonderful people that I respect.

25:16.767 --> 25:17.428
That's marvelous.

25:18.068 --> 25:24.835
All right, now have we left out any important topics that you can think of that we should have included?

25:31.301 --> 25:33.263
If not, I've got only one question left.

25:33.412 --> 25:38.377
Well, there's one statement that I would make and it's not important to anybody but me.

25:40.539 --> 25:47.566
My experience with A&M has been long.

25:48.627 --> 25:50.269
It's been a wonderful experience.

25:50.289 --> 26:02.541
It has included athletics and academics and I want to say that as an Aggie, as a father,

26:05.643 --> 26:22.300
As a former faculty member and former jock, if you will, I'm disturbed by the trend that I see in athletics at the college level.

26:23.701 --> 26:30.368
The emphasis is way out of bounds, and I wish there's some way that we could

26:31.968 --> 26:37.274
move back toward academics more and less emphasis on athletics.

26:39.477 --> 26:40.098
I agree with you.

26:40.618 --> 26:45.804
My last question, what feelings do you carry in your heart today for Texas A&M?

26:46.245 --> 26:46.785
What feelings?

26:49.108 --> 26:51.211
How do you feel about this institution?

26:52.813 --> 26:55.195
It's just a four-letter word, love.

26:56.537 --> 26:57.418
That's a great ending.
