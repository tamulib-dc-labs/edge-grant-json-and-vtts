00:01.786 --> 00:13.022
For example, at Penn, the subvention was $200,000 
a year and free use of investment money and free

00:01.786 --> 00:13.022
space. At A&M, the subvention is $330,000 a year, 
free space, free use of investment money, and

00:14.044 --> 00:26.241
these funds that we have That amount to, you know, 
if you take the total amount that's in these funds,

00:26.542 --> 00:33.478
it's around $4 million. And those funds are very 
important to the financial stability of this

00:34.320 --> 00:37.728
press. They can't suffice alone. We also need the 
subvention. But between the funds and the

00:41.978 --> 00:44.263
subvention, This press was far better off than any 
other press I had seen. I had served on a review

00:47.885 --> 00:55.313
committee at Northwestern, which was in very bad 
shape financially, and had serious problems. At

00:55.333 --> 01:05.425
Cornell, where they were losing money and didn't 
have financial support. The university was

01:05.445 --> 01:09.930
supporting them, but grudging them. So I felt one 
of the reasons I came here was because it did have

01:10.585 --> 01:29.814
both the psychological and emotional support 
from its administration

01:10.585 --> 01:29.814
that

01:10.585 --> 01:29.814
Henry Quest needed, and it had financial support 
better than any other place. So those were the

01:29.834 --> 01:33.480
factors, probably, Henry, that convinced me. 
Okay, now, when you arrived, how were you? Are you

01:37.906 --> 01:38.787
disappointed? Were your perceptions okay? No. I 
think I got what I bargained for. I thought that

01:48.360 --> 01:56.471
this place was every bit what I suspected it was. 
There was only one surprise, and it escaped me

01:57.051 --> 02:07.305
because I didn't have a base for it, and that is the 
bureaucracy of a state university. has been my

02:07.657 --> 02:11.363
biggest frustration at A&M. It's not anything 
that causes me to go home at night and go to sleep.

02:17.091 --> 02:21.678
But it is more frustrating to deal with than what I 
had to deal with. And this is less of an

02:22.219 --> 02:26.786
entrepreneurial kind of institution than Penn 
was. Penn was very entrepreneurial. And so at

02:28.148 --> 02:36.280
Penn, the money went to people who demonstrated 
that they could make money for the university do

02:36.412 --> 02:38.715
what they had to do for the university. Here, it's 
more bureaucratic. It's political here. And you

02:43.743 --> 02:53.797
could, in my judgment, you could be one of the best 
managers or administrators around. And if you're

02:54.298 --> 03:01.148
not doing it politically or from a bureaucratic 
point of view, you won't get any more money. They

03:01.188 --> 03:03.431
give money to the people who demonstrate. In fact, 
I wonder if sometime this if the efficiency of this

03:06.652 --> 03:13.443
press might not have targeted the press in terms of 
the financial. It did. Robert Smith, for example,

03:14.745 --> 03:20.274
targeted it because it was being successful 
financially, so they went after it. At Penn, they

03:20.294 --> 03:23.981
would give it more money because they said, you're 
doing terrifically. And that's one thing I had

03:25.102 --> 03:26.685
to... I had to come to grips with when I came here. I 
mean, some of the staff, I would say things at our

03:28.826 --> 03:36.973
advisory council meeting where I would report 
financially what we were doing and how well we were

03:28.826 --> 03:36.973
doing. And Diana Hine would come up to me and say, 
don't tell them that, because they'll take our

03:37.693 --> 03:43.519
money away if you do that. And I said, well, I was 
taken aback by that. I said, well, no. I said, if

03:48.263 --> 03:53.628
you're doing well, you should tell people that, 
and you should be rewarded for it. That's right.

03:55.319 --> 03:58.062
Bureaucrats don't think that way. That's the 
difference between the way an entrepreneur

03:58.462 --> 04:02.747
thinks and the way a bureaucrat thinks. And so that 
has had to be something I've been doing. Good,

04:05.169 --> 04:07.652
because I have that in the text already. And I 
haven't focused it, but it's there. Do it, because

04:10.134 --> 04:13.758
that's a clear factor in this university. That was 
the only explanation for part of what was going on.

04:18.002 --> 04:23.368
It's

04:18.002 --> 04:23.368
classic that a Robert Smith, would do that. He's a 
classic bureaucrat. And so he goes after people

04:26.884 --> 04:41.557
who have money, so he takes it away from them and 
would give that money to someone that was

04:26.884 --> 04:41.557
politically sensitive for him, that would 
accomplish his goals, his objectives, that sort

04:26.884 --> 04:41.557
of thing. And to me, that was the wrong thing to do. 
Now, that didn't happen to me. It hasn't happened

04:45.580 --> 04:47.101
to me. But the people here were fearful that it 
would happen. Yes. Yes, I know. I picked that up

04:51.125 --> 04:53.447
several levels. Yeah. I continue, even though I 
know that there are bureaucrats here, and there

04:54.820 --> 05:11.623
are people who think that way, I still have 
confidence that if you demonstrate to people that

04:54.820 --> 05:11.623
you're accomplishing the goals that you set out to 
be, like my goals are two goals. I've got to enhance

05:12.184 --> 05:19.274
the reputation of the press and the university by 
virtue of our publishing program. And I have to do

05:19.294 --> 05:22.419
that in a financially responsible way. And I feel 
that If I do that, I should tell people about it and

05:23.947 --> 05:32.501
not worry that they're going to take money away 
from me. I would prefer not to do that. So at the

05:34.385 --> 05:43.580
advisory council meeting, Ray Bowen goes to that 
meeting, Barry Thompson goes to that meeting, and

05:34.385 --> 05:43.580
I give a report. And I tell them what we're doing 
financially. We're doing extremely well

05:46.746 --> 05:49.971
financially, and I never... for the moment 
hesitated, or blushed, or anything like that. I

05:54.294 --> 05:55.235
told the facts. And I had confidence, maybe wrong, 
that they would say, this guy's doing what he's

05:55.856 --> 06:03.026
supposed to do. That's right. And the other side of 
that coin is, the money placed with a press is

06:03.326 --> 06:07.252
well-placed. Yes. It pays dividends. If I were 
president, that's the way I would think. That's

06:10.777 --> 06:11.418
the way it should be. That's the way I would run the 
university. I would put money in the hands of

06:12.940 --> 06:18.287
people who can demonstrate that they know what to 
do with it. And the ones who don't, I would not give

06:18.807 --> 06:22.692
them any money, or I'd get rid of them. That's 
right. It doesn't always work that way. No, it

06:26.357 --> 06:27.138
doesn't. So when you arrive, what are your first 
administrative acts or

06:27.158 --> 06:35.810
encounters? Well, the first thing we had to do at 
that point, there are many things, but one of the

06:36.070 --> 06:47.025
crucial things was to decide on what kind of a 
publisher we wanted to be. Did we want to become a

06:47.461 --> 06:54.690
regional publisher in Frank's version of that? 
Did we want to become something more than that? And

06:57.874 --> 07:17.417
I had decided after my interviews here, and based 
on what my own goals are as an individual, as a

06:57.874 --> 07:17.417
publisher, that we should maintain, indeed maybe 
even strengthen, our ability as a regional

06:57.874 --> 07:17.417
publisher, but at the same time start becoming 
more of a scholarly publisher, with the ability to

07:17.954 --> 07:28.388
reach an international audience and become much 
more important as an international publisher and

07:17.954 --> 07:28.388
a national publisher. So I wanted to make sure that 
the staff felt that way too and the staff did. You

07:36.338 --> 07:47.893
know, we talked about what we should do and how we 
should do it, what was important to us, and the

07:36.338 --> 07:47.893
staff wanted to go beyond being a regional 
publisher because they were getting the

07:36.338 --> 07:47.893
criticism too. Gayla and Mary Lynn, who sat in the 
search committee meetings. Gayla was a member of

07:52.268 --> 07:54.130
the search committee. They would hear Ham Hill 
say, you know, I think we have a backward press. It

07:59.878 --> 08:01.600
is nothing but a regional publisher. We are not 
known by my colleagues around the world or

08:02.301 --> 08:07.929
nationally. And it's an embarrassment. And he 
would say those things. And so they knew that their

08:11.093 --> 08:14.978
survival was dependent upon the goodwill of the 
faculty and our reputation. They were worried

08:22.721 --> 08:23.642
about it. They knew that if Ham Hill went to Ray 
Bowen or to the provost and said things like that,

08:23.903 --> 08:33.295
that it might affect their future. So they were 
100% behind the idea. So what we decided to do was

08:37.261 --> 08:42.788
to... Now, did you have sort of a series of Or is this 
just part of the usual schedule of events in terms

08:43.122 --> 08:48.878
of ? Well, first of all, I made it a practice for us to 
have biweekly staff meetings. And they used to

08:58.124 --> 08:59.526
have weekly meetings. They were meeting too much 
with the staff. The whole press would meet with the

09:01.288 --> 09:03.391
staff. So I changed that to making it just the 
departmental managers meeting bi-weekly. And

09:08.297 --> 09:12.903
then I met weekly with each departmental manager. 
And then I encouraged each staff member to do the

09:12.923 --> 09:21.875
same thing with each manager, to meet with their 
staff. But we did this both formally as well as

09:21.975 --> 09:27.642
informally. and we decided what areas we would 
focus on. You know, we would get out of areas where

09:31.680 --> 09:40.869
we were not a player, not a significant player, and 
we would focus on areas where we were a significant

09:31.680 --> 09:40.869
player. Okay, can you define those? Sure, sure. 
They're areas that won't surprise you. From a

09:46.214 --> 09:57.865
regional point of view, we wanted to maintain our, 
and indeed strengthen our position in Texas

09:46.214 --> 09:57.865
history, southwestern history, military 
history, But

09:58.317 --> 10:15.598
we clearly said we wanted to do everything, if not 
more, than what we had been doing in the regional

09:58.317 --> 10:15.598
areas. We also wanted to expand areas where we had 
some presence. needed to become more of an

10:24.575 --> 10:52.675
international publisher such as natural science 
or natural history nautical archaeology where we

10:24.575 --> 10:52.675
were we had an international reputation in a field 
that is a very small field but was good for us

10:24.575 --> 10:52.675
because this university has a reputation there 
we've been doing books there so nautical

10:24.575 --> 10:52.675
archaeology was another we wanted to start

10:54.528 --> 11:00.717
publishing in Presidential Studies because of 
the Bush Library, because we knew that would

10:54.528 --> 11:00.717
provide opportunities. So we wanted to do an 
international effort there. And we hired

11:04.362 --> 11:09.489
consulting editors. We started a series fund. Joe 
Hughes gave us $50,000. So Presidential Studies

11:12.973 --> 11:20.063
was an area where we wanted to speak anthropology. 
How did you get that $50,000? I actually got it by

11:22.726 --> 11:26.850
talking with Joe Hughes. Joe Hughes was a guy who is 
an Aggie who's made money in the oil business. And

11:38.702 --> 11:47.230
he and I started talking, and we wanted to know what 
opportunities there were for the press. I talked

11:47.250 --> 11:51.855
to him about presidential studies, about giving 
one to know how much money. I told him a minimum of

11:52.645 --> 11:57.451
$50,000, but we would prefer $100,000. He ended up 
giving us $50,000. We tried to get $100,000, but we

11:59.594 --> 12:02.759
couldn't get it. You know, just as simply as that, 
just talking to a certain person was interesting.

12:08.626 --> 12:10.649
Where did you run into him? Frank Hubert, who used 
to be the chancellor of this place, told me about

12:10.669 --> 12:17.518
him. And he is Frank's nephew, or something like 
that. It's related to Frank. And so we first

12:23.155 --> 12:27.941
started talking on the phone. And he was impressed 
with the fact that Frank used to get a free copy of

12:29.102 --> 12:35.570
every one of our books. And he worked me over for our 
giving him them. We send him a copy of every one of

12:40.115 --> 12:48.585
our books when we publish, as we do all the other 
administrators around here. But he would not have

12:48.605 --> 12:51.829
given us the money did not do that. It was important 
for him to see what was happening. Yeah, and he

12:58.731 --> 12:59.632
likes books. He's a book lover, you know, so that 
way we were able to tie his interest in books.

13:06.662 --> 13:07.823
That's what I asked John. I said, do you like books? 
Yeah. I suspected if you asked Joe Moore the same

13:13.210 --> 13:16.875
question, he might say the same thing. I don't 
know. I don't know if I asked Joe that. I think I did.

13:20.429 --> 13:23.872
And I think that's basically, if I didn't, that's 
the response. I think people who give money to

13:24.753 --> 13:31.580
presses have to like books, but these two guys are 
exceptional. They've given us money. I think they

13:32.721 --> 13:36.966
like Frank Wardlaw, and they, you know, someone 
convinced them. Yeah, they're people perfect.

13:39.668 --> 13:39.789
Yeah. They saw Frank as a visionary, and probably, 
you know, bought into him. Anyway, Joe Hughes...

13:47.851 --> 13:51.054
gave us money because, I think, of his love for 
books. And he wanted to do something for his

13:51.935 --> 13:58.241
university, so we got him to do it that way. But 
presidential studies, anthropology,

13:58.261 --> 14:13.977
borderland studies, nautical archaeology, 
architecture, these are all fields where we had

13:58.261 --> 14:13.977
some potential or presence, and we said, These are 
the areas we want to focus on and build a reputation

14:14.260 --> 14:19.768
internationally. We also wanted to build on some 
strengths at A&M, like agriculture and vet

14:19.788 --> 14:27.400
medicine. And so we're trying to build a series in 
those areas too, but they are not as a higher

14:36.299 --> 14:43.428
priority for us at this point because we have so 
many fish to fry in this other area. And we don't

14:43.448 --> 14:54.622
have a lot of people to do acquisitions, so we have

14:43.448 --> 14:54.622
to focus on areas where we have the highest 
potential. And those areas are basically what I

14:55.303 --> 14:59.568
just told you. Most of the stuff that Mary Lynn 
does, for example, is borderlands, presidential

14:59.588 --> 15:05.175
studies, Western history, Texana. Most of the 
stuff that Noel does is military history, natural

15:08.824 --> 15:21.201
science,

15:08.824 --> 15:21.201
architecture, nautical archaeology. So those 
are areas where we're trying to build our

15:21.221 --> 15:25.427
architecture. Have you seen anything on the list 
that we really don't need to make an area that How

15:34.535 --> 15:35.736
about the arts here? Where do you want to go? Well, 
Texas art, because we have money, and Joe Moore,

15:37.498 --> 15:47.367
Joe Bay, we continue to do those, and we will. We see 
that as part of the regional thing that we should

15:47.948 --> 15:51.591
maintain. That's not an area where we said, let's 
get out of it. How

15:56.356 --> 16:00.660
many times have I said this? decided

16:01.703 --> 16:15.861
to get out was philosophy.

16:15.881 --> 16:21.387
And that proved to be very ticklish politically, 
because

16:15.881 --> 16:21.387
Herman Sadekamp had, I think, been signed as an 
editor. And

16:21.407 --> 16:29.878
we had to tell him that we didn't know what to focus 
on. Performing arts, that was a field we were in. We

16:31.353 --> 16:49.081
dabbled in literature and literary criticism, 
and we felt that that was an area where we either had

16:31.353 --> 16:49.081
to go in in a big way or get out, and we decided

16:31.353 --> 16:49.081
to get out of it. International history, like 
British history or European history, we felt was

16:49.101 --> 16:58.255
not important to us. I think

16:58.555 --> 17:08.215
Balkan studies were there. Eastern European 
studies we see as more of a, not just history, but

17:08.335 --> 17:19.298
that one is where we decided to focus. where we felt 
we had a shot. But we didn't want to do 20th century

17:21.396 --> 17:33.251
European history books, or ancient history 
books, or medieval history books, or things like

17:21.396 --> 17:33.251
that. And we had done an occasional book there.

17:39.419 --> 17:41.662
Journalism, we said no. We had done some books 
there.

17:46.628 --> 17:47.790
We didn't want to do any books there. We said 
literature, folklore. Folklore only insofar as

17:48.978 --> 17:59.991
it relates to Texas history and Texana, then we 
would do folklore. Medical humanities, you know,

18:00.011 --> 18:03.555
getting out of that field. Performing arts, you 
know, film, music, theater, getting out of that.

18:19.589 --> 18:24.896
That's OK. Education.

18:25.397 --> 18:26.338
Sociology. Sports. We had done the occasional 
sports, but we said no. So those are basically the

18:32.305 --> 18:35.790
areas we got out of. The areas we stayed in are the 
ones that I've already mentioned. Our strong

18:42.138 --> 18:47.385
suits are Texas history, natural science, 
Nautical archaeology,

18:47.939 --> 18:53.328
borderland studies.

18:58.337 --> 19:01.061
What about economics? We don't regard it as a 
strong field, but because we have a series fund, we

19:01.081 --> 19:06.931
want to continue to publish them. We are 
publishing them. Wherever we had series money, we

19:08.935 --> 19:12.681
felt that we had a presence. We decided to stay in. 
But if we didn't have money, we didn't have a

19:15.132 --> 19:19.919
presence, we decided to get out. So this is one of 
the major things that I had to do when I came here,

19:19.939 --> 19:29.692
was to decide what kind of publisher we wanted to be 
and what fields we wanted to focus on. And we did

19:30.453 --> 19:36.362
that as a staff, and we used certain criteria to 
make the judgment. Financial support, presence,

19:40.353 --> 19:51.187
whether the field was competitive or not 
competitive, and whether we could never make a

19:40.353 --> 19:51.187
dent no matter how much money we had because the 
field was just dominated by too many other people.

19:51.207 --> 20:06.968
But in scholarly publishing, you don't have to 
worry about that one too much because none of the

19:51.207 --> 20:06.968
fields are, while there are dominant publishers, 
you can become a scholarly publisher without

19:51.207 --> 20:06.968
difficulty if you have the money. What are your 
aspirations in terms of production for the press,

20:08.382 --> 20:17.256
in terms of volume, numbers of books? When you 
came, we were running 35, 40. Between 35, it varied

20:20.441 --> 20:25.408
between 30 to 35 books. Maybe 40. We're now doing 
about 60. That is, in this fiscal year, we will do 61

20:33.408 --> 20:36.033
books. We took our two catalogs and counted the 
books. We're about 61 books now. When we built our

20:41.804 --> 20:47.214
long-range plan, we talked about doing 100 books a 
year. And we ultimately decided against it

20:48.216 --> 20:54.808
because we felt, the staff felt strongly about 
this. We

20:55.126 --> 21:03.638
felt that if we became that big a publisher, we 
would have to start changing the culture. We would

21:04.379 --> 21:05.921
have to expand it. We would have to get more money. 
We would start interfering with our daily lives

21:09.786 --> 21:17.877
more than we wanted to. So they're very proud of the 
family. They are. And Frank built it on a family

21:20.827 --> 21:23.331
basis. I'm not a family publisher. Unlike Frank, I 
believe that if you start mixing family with

21:27.257 --> 21:33.768
business, you have problems. The big problem, in 
my mind, when you're running a family business, so

21:33.788 --> 21:40.439
to speak, is if you have to fire someone, you can't 
do it. Try firing one of your children, for

21:41.080 --> 21:43.183
example. You can't do it. So I have strong 
management feelings about whether you should

21:46.055 --> 21:52.904
become as family-oriented as Frank was. Frank got 
away with it. Frank did it. Frank exploited it. But

21:58.271 --> 22:00.214
it's not my style. It doesn't fit the modern world 
very well. No, it doesn't. It's a different era.

22:05.521 --> 22:07.303
But that is part of the culture. That's what he... 
That was part of the Stetter problem. The family

22:11.497 --> 22:13.259
got disrupted. Yeah, that's right. And I don't 
know if Stetter knew enough about management

22:15.041 --> 22:19.866
to... Well, he didn't. He didn't know enough about 
management to even recognize that probably it was

22:20.587 --> 22:29.937
a family management notion around here. Although 
maybe he did. Maybe unfairly. But he got him in

22:34.242 --> 22:35.904
trouble. Certainly did, yeah. So you backed off, 
and you're kind of settled back to a, what, 60, 75

22:37.388 --> 22:44.957
titles, or do you have a real target? I don't think 
we, you know, we do. I'd say that we're trying to

22:47.300 --> 22:51.505
maintain around 60, 65 titles. Why? We think 
that's optimum for the number of people we have

22:53.748 --> 23:01.057
here and for the kind of environment we want to 
maintain. We go beyond that. We're going to have to

23:02.448 --> 23:18.187
expand the place physically, expand it in terms of 
personnel, and we think that given the conditions

23:02.448 --> 23:18.187
that exist in the industry today, it's probably 
not a wise thing to do. Tremendous problems in the

23:18.307 --> 23:19.929
industry. Okay, what kind of problems? That's 
what I want to talk to you about, too, in a little

23:21.170 --> 23:23.773
bit. Where do you see book publishing going, 
especially university book publishing? What's

23:27.457 --> 23:29.299
out there now? The big problem that's out there now 
is that the scholarly monograph is under serious

23:29.439 --> 23:38.066
directs. That is, libraries, the principal 
purchasers of scholarly monographs, are cutting

23:38.126 --> 23:49.737
back and spending more money on technology than 
they are on books. And so every university in

23:49.757 --> 23:55.742
France that publishes scholarly monographs has 
seen their their sales declined dramatically.

24:00.043 --> 24:03.887
That's one of the wisdoms that Frank had. Frank 
knew 20 years ago that scholarly publishing was

24:03.907 --> 24:10.213
deficit publishing. He knew that if he just did 
scholarly monographs, he'd go out of business, or

24:10.313 --> 24:19.583
that the administration would stop supporting 
him. So he said, I'm going to do books that are

24:19.603 --> 24:24.488
regional significance. Those books sell. And I 
like doing them anyway, and I'll keep the rules,

24:26.300 --> 24:35.915
the financial rules away from the door, and I'll 
accomplish what I believe in, and that's the way to

24:26.300 --> 24:35.915
do it. The problem is, you know, that works 
financially, but it doesn't keep the academic

24:36.937 --> 24:43.868
books up. You know, so guys like Ham Hill and Silver 
and other people that Frank had trouble with got

24:43.888 --> 24:52.982
after him because he was too conventional. So the 
trick today is, if you're running a university

24:53.502 --> 25:15.469
press, is you've got to be financially 
responsible, and you've got to accomplish what

24:53.502 --> 25:15.469
universities expect university presses to do, 
which is to contribute to scholarship, enhance

24:53.502 --> 25:15.469
the reputation of the university, keep the 
faculty happy. So doing that today is tougher than

25:15.489 --> 25:22.598
it has ever been.

25:22.932 --> 25:24.634
The libraries aren't buying books. Even the 
people who are publishing saleable books, like

25:25.095 --> 25:30.461
regional books and trade books, those books are 
being returned. The superstores now are buying

25:30.601 --> 25:38.371
these books in great quantities, but they're 
returning them in even greater quantities. Oh, I

25:38.411 --> 25:38.992
know. They are. I know. I've personally 
experienced that. Yeah. So the trick is you need to

25:42.456 --> 25:51.387
publish, in my view, a variety of books. You can't 
just do regional books. You can't just do

25:53.774 --> 25:56.197
scholarly monographs. You've got to do 
textbooks, professional books, reference

25:56.217 --> 26:02.384
books, and electronic things as well. And you've 
got to do that within a financial framework that is

26:02.444 --> 26:10.973
consistent with what the person expects. Yeah. 
Can you, for example, do a text type book?

26:15.198 --> 26:15.518
Absolutely. Absolutely. There's always been 
some constraint, at least talking, for example,

26:16.831 --> 26:24.303
to Boyd, I guess. You always worry about the 
charitable philanthropic status of the press. If

26:29.452 --> 26:31.876
you start joining the marketplace, what happens? 
I think that's enough. Unnecessary. The

26:34.599 --> 26:38.425
University Press is long before Lloyd Lyman was in 
the University Press. Well, Chicago, of course,

26:38.445 --> 26:40.388
is the classic. Chicago, I mean, absolutely. I 
mean, when I was a student, I used a Chicago book

26:44.113 --> 26:48.840
that was called Animals Without Backbones. Now, 
this was back in 1950. That was the

26:50.343 --> 26:55.190
best-selling... General Biology. Yeah, it was 
the best-selling invertebrate zoology book. I

26:58.615 --> 27:01.519
mean, Lloyd had a different notion of that. Lloyd 
was from the old, he was from the August Fruget

27:02.951 --> 27:15.827
School of Books, which was, you know, pristine 
scholarly monographs where, you know, you don't

27:02.951 --> 27:15.827
dirty yourself with commercial kind of things. 
And now, I may be miscasting him, but university

27:15.947 --> 27:24.418
presses have been publishing textbooks as ever 
since probably they've been in business. Some of

27:27.667 --> 27:30.390
them even started doing textbooks. And you can do 
textbooks. You can't do the basic blockbuster

27:34.735 --> 27:39.120
introductory biology books. That's a commercial 
gain. But you can do the supplemental pieces. You

27:42.324 --> 27:43.526
can do the supplemental books. And how many 
university press books have you used on a

27:44.146 --> 27:48.512
supplemental basis in teaching history courses? 
I think you used a number of them over the years.

27:50.774 --> 27:52.016
Certainly. I tried to, of course. Exactly. 
Vandiver's, whatever, Blood Brothers. Sure. 20%

27:57.059 --> 28:00.446
of our business is probably... I think there's a 
place for that. Absolutely. I think that's a big

28:02.450 --> 28:05.116
opportunity there. Absolutely. There's a place 
for us in reference publishing, and we do

28:06.278 --> 28:09.706
reference publishing. There's a place for us in 
professional publishing, and we do professional

28:09.726 --> 28:13.153
publishing. You know, I think the answer is you've 
got to do a variety of different types of books. But

28:18.845 --> 28:30.096
you need to focus on a smaller number of areas where 
you have strength, presence, and the financial

28:18.845 --> 28:30.096
ability to do what is important. And so that's what 
we're setting out to do. And I think Frank set out to

28:34.501 --> 28:39.346
do that in regional publishing. And he would do the 
occasional scholarly monograph to keep some

28:43.441 --> 28:49.491
people happy, and probably to justify the fact 
that he was a university press. But there are now

28:49.511 --> 28:55.842
university press directors that are saying, we 
can't survive doing these kind of labels. We've

28:55.862 --> 28:58.086
got to become a trade publisher. And I think if they 
do that, they're headed into a disaster. First of

29:02.353 --> 29:03.255
all, Why does a university need a trade publisher? 
I mean, if I was Ray Bowen, it's the last thing in the

29:06.363 --> 29:10.328
world I'd want is a trade publisher. But I'd 
certainly want a scholarly publisher to enhance

29:10.909 --> 29:29.614
our reputation, and to help spread the word about 
A&M, and to give us visibility, and to be able to say

29:10.909 --> 29:29.614
to ourselves, we're a research university, and we 
disseminate and diffuse that research through

29:29.847 --> 29:33.671
books and other electronic products. So that's, 
in my view, the way university presses have got to

29:33.691 --> 29:41.820
operate in the future. And I think they will. And I 
think that they have been doing that in the past.

29:46.606 --> 29:50.831
It's just that some of them have done things a 
little bit differently. Some of them have done

29:50.851 --> 29:53.053
like a pen. 95% of the books we did were scholarly 
modern books. That was strictly a scholarly

29:56.489 --> 30:07.250
publishing and we had the support of the 
university to do that and that's the way we did our

29:56.489 --> 30:07.250
business. Frank said We're not going to do 
scholarly monographs. First of all, probably I

30:10.781 --> 30:12.604
don't like them too much. Secondly, they don't 
make money. Third, I'm interested in promoting

30:14.908 --> 30:21.558
the Southwest as a cultural enterprise. Romantic 
world. So that's the way he cut it. And at Texas, he

30:24.703 --> 30:30.171
ran out of steam. Do you feel like you get any kind of 
direction, supervision,

30:37.330 --> 30:50.168
from the higher administration at A&M, or do they 
leave you pretty much alone, or are you pretty much

30:37.330 --> 30:50.168
an independent director? I would say that Ray 
Bowman does that in his year, and all the others. I

30:58.360 --> 31:06.612
have the occasional instance where there

30:58.360 --> 31:06.612
was a time, I'm going to tell you the story, because 
it illustrates how I'd like to ask you a little bit

31:06.862 --> 31:20.876
about Texas A&M University Press and its 
relations to other Texas presses, and

31:06.862 --> 31:20.876
particularly, I suppose, to your clients and your 
distributors and your associates and whoever.

31:20.896 --> 31:30.847
Well, basically I'd say that the two major presses 
in Texas are UT and A&M. UT is clearly a more

31:30.867 --> 31:36.092
important and larger press than A&M. Frank, I 
think, was there longer and did a better job, had

31:36.730 --> 31:46.690
more time, of course, to do.
