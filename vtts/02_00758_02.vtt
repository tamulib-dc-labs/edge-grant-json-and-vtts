00:01.769 --> 00:02.069
Oh. Well, just the thought of going back to where he 
lost so many good people. And in one of his letters

00:10.321 --> 00:25.183
to me, in talking about it, he really admired the 
bravery of all the rangers that served under him.

00:25.203 --> 00:28.688
He said they gave their all as good soldiers 
should.

00:31.435 --> 00:31.996
And it is. So in 54, when the writer, Bill Hines, 
called and asked Earl if he would go back to France,

00:34.220 --> 00:50.912
take him, our son, and he wanted to do an article for 
the 10th anniversary of D-Day. Merrill wasn't

00:52.850 --> 00:59.316
sure at all that he could go back to where he lost all 
those people. But we kept working on seeing what it

00:59.336 --> 01:04.481
would mean to our son to be able to go there. So he 
did. And then I said he was, that was in 54. And then

01:12.409 --> 01:21.338
55, that's after he took office at the land office 
at General Eisenhower, President Eisenhower.

01:22.010 --> 01:29.039
asked him to be his representative to the 10th 
anniversary of the liberation of Colmar, which

01:22.010 --> 01:29.039
his regiment liberated. And he went back for that. 
And then in 1964,

01:33.705 --> 01:44.979
he was asked to go back for the 20th anniversary of 
D-Day. And that was nice. And then in 69, British TV

01:47.682 --> 01:51.527
did a film called Ten men went to war. And Earl was 
the only one from the United States that was asked

01:55.046 --> 01:58.170
to go for that. And he took our younger son with him 
then. And he never got to see the movie. You see,

02:05.620 --> 02:08.064
they went in fall of 69. I'm not sure his father's 
been. But anyway, it was shown in England for the

02:10.667 --> 02:17.076
25th anniversary of D-Day. And at the time they 
made this film, they were negotiating with CBS to

02:17.174 --> 02:22.519
show it over here. But that never did work out. So we 
finally, after his death, see, like I say, he never

02:25.122 --> 02:31.088
saw it. We did get a copy of the film. And what they 
did for each of these 10 men, they filmed them where

02:34.111 --> 02:43.300
something significant happened to them. in 
France. And then they filmed them in what their

02:45.163 --> 02:48.107
present day job was. So they sent four fellas over 
here from the British TV company. And so they

02:54.937 --> 03:01.186
arranged a core review and a lot of things for them 
here. That'll probably be a good show for A&M, you

03:01.827 --> 03:06.233
know. But that was 69, and as I say, he got sick in 
January of 75. Well, you

03:13.093 --> 03:25.411
were First Lady, and what exactly was your role? 
Well, there was lots of entertaining, which I'm

03:26.973 --> 03:33.362
sure has happened to all of them through the years. 
One thing that we... had that we enjoyed, and I

03:38.917 --> 03:47.449
still run into some of those fellows now, but we had 
student leader meetings every month in the house.

03:47.469 --> 03:50.273
And I never did get to sit in on the meetings. I said, 
I was so good, I got to serve refreshments, then I

03:50.293 --> 03:55.160
could disappear. So, I always wanted to know what 
they had to talk about, but I never did that. Then we

04:00.428 --> 04:01.730
entertained a lot. Contrary to some things that 
have been said, we did Actually, we were the first

04:07.098 --> 04:12.826
ones to live in the new President's House, which 
was not so new anymore. We moved into that in

04:14.028 --> 04:23.983
October of 1965,

04:14.028 --> 04:23.983
having been the last ones to live in the old 
President's House, which burned in 63. And then in

04:24.003 --> 04:31.654
October of 65, we moved into the one I still call the 
new one. They had an interesting history on how

04:32.225 --> 04:35.230
they made it. Do you want to tell us some of the 
things about making it? Well, it really did kind of

04:38.334 --> 04:45.746
connect the generations, I guess, in a way. The 
home that is there now, the Pagan's Home, built

04:47.028 --> 04:56.562
from brick that was handmade in Hearn in the early 
1890s. They built the science hall from it. And at

04:59.156 --> 05:07.088
the time the old President's House burned, they 
had already planned to tear the science hall down

04:59.156 --> 05:07.088
and build a new building there. So they reserved 
enough of that brick to build the President's

05:08.570 --> 05:13.618
House. I had one old professor who's no longer 
living came up to me one day in the grocery store. He

05:19.607 --> 05:22.752
said, you know, it just does my heart good to look 
over there at that house. I spent 40 years of my life

05:23.170 --> 05:25.473
behind that brick. Anyway, there were so many nice 
donations that were made to the building of the

05:26.555 --> 05:37.331
house that my husband always called it the best 
bargain the state of Texas had. Bob Bernath, who

05:39.293 --> 05:41.837
was a concrete man here in town, He gave all the 
concrete for all these driveways and things

05:42.155 --> 05:50.467
around it. Fort Allbritton, who was on the board, 
gave the doors and windows. And Dow Chemical, Dr.

05:55.414 --> 05:59.680
Boyle was on the board. They gave the insulation. 
And there were other donations to it. So I remember

06:05.888 --> 06:10.575
my husband saying that it cost $60,000. And at the 
time it was built, it had 6,500 square feet. So that

06:15.644 --> 06:19.230
was a bargain by anybody's estimation. Of course, 
now it's unbelievable.

06:25.859 --> 06:27.221
It was a very livable home. And we entertained a 
lot. And we had things like a statewide garden club

06:30.366 --> 06:36.495
meeting, had East Texas Chamber of Commerce. 
Didn't you put some dogwoods in the house one time?

06:42.258 --> 06:44.401
Didn't you put some dogwood blossoms in the house 
one time? That was for East Texas Chamber of

06:44.421 --> 06:46.063
Commerce. I had visited my college roommate who 
lives at Williamsburg and was riding the dogwood.

06:52.731 --> 06:54.573
It was in full bloom and I just loved it. So I came 
back with a carload of it, in water of course. And we

06:59.915 --> 07:03.360
decorated the entire downstairs of the house with 
all the wood. It was really pretty. I think it was my

07:06.084 --> 07:09.829
favorite decoration of all the times. But see, I 
love to do flowers. And I would do the flowers for

07:13.054 --> 07:15.677
all the entertainment we did. I ordered them one 
time. We first moved into the house before

07:18.561 --> 07:24.049
anything grew back of the house.

07:25.447 --> 07:36.527
and my

07:25.447 --> 07:36.527
husband let me pay for it out of their household 
budget, which I didn't have much in that budget

07:25.447 --> 07:36.527
anyway. So I decided I'd better learn to arrange 
flowers. I loved that. How's your role different

07:42.938 --> 07:46.645
from Mrs. Mulberry's role? I don't really know. 
I'm sure they did a lot of entertaining, too, like

07:48.271 --> 07:55.880
we did, where she's teaching this year. And so I 
guess they can't do as much. But I guess it's pretty

07:58.863 --> 08:07.132
standard that anybody that has that position can 
expect to do a lot of entertaining. And it was

08:08.494 --> 08:10.075
always fun. We used to have faculty groups, 
student groups, you name it. But through that

08:19.092 --> 08:22.818
life, you get to meet so many interesting people. 
Some of the people you've met were Lyndon Johnson

08:25.462 --> 08:30.109
and Omar Badri. Oh, everybody from A to Z.

08:30.590 --> 08:40.505
I'd have to stop and think a while. We've met from 
kings on down. You just never know who's going to.

08:45.232 --> 08:47.986
That's the nice thing about a university 
environment. You do get to meet so many people. And

08:51.966 --> 08:53.453
of course, we love the football.

09:01.499 --> 09:13.658
This is an interview with Margaret Rutter by Lisa 
Rush on May 5th, 1993 at Mrs. Rutter's house

09:01.499 --> 09:13.658
concerning her life at A&M during the 60s and World 
War II. In the interest of accumulating

09:14.520 --> 09:21.451
knowledge, I am asking you to donate this tape to me 
or to the Texas A&M Oral History Collection in the

09:14.520 --> 09:21.451
University Archives. Is that alright with you? 
Okay. Thank you.
