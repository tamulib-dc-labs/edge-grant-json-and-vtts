WEBVTT

00:09.312 --> 00:12.276
What's wrong with that? There it goes. Okay, so you 
were part of the occupation forces. That's right.

00:16.421 --> 00:27.295
Anyhow, you know we acquired the Virgin Islands 
from Denmark, $13 million, the three islands, St.

00:16.421 --> 00:27.295
John, St. Thomas, and St. Croix. And we were 
stationed in the old gendarme barracks there. As I

00:31.992 --> 00:36.317
said, I commanded the 21st Company in St. Croix. I 
was post-treasurer, acting assistant

00:36.837 --> 00:41.283
quartermaster, and I was also the judge advocate. 
I didn't get that down there. Okay. How many men did

00:43.946 --> 00:47.490
you have under your command then when you left as a 
captain? A Marine company in those days was 100

00:49.232 --> 00:51.114
men.

00:56.520 --> 01:01.105
In this occupation force, it was the 21st Company 
and the 149th Company and a... a detachment of

01:01.405 --> 01:08.297
artillery and a detachment of signal and all that 
was assigned over there on our island. How'd you

01:09.259 --> 01:11.283
get along with the people in the Virgin Islands? 
Uh, good and bad. I guess, uh, of course I was a

01:14.028 --> 01:16.372
Marine. I didn't fraternize with the natives and 
uh, I just tended my own business, and I had a lot to

01:21.301 --> 01:27.529
tend to, because as you can notice, they loaded me 
up with assignments. You had a lot of jobs. How'd

01:29.191 --> 01:30.573
you do all of these things? Well, they said they 
wanted to docinate me well in the Marine Corps and

01:30.853 --> 01:39.043
give me a chance for the experience. All right. I 
returned to the States, and I... I, uh... resigned

01:47.744 --> 01:51.229
to be the captain in 1920. But I remembered well 
what General Pershing had to say, that if they'd

01:52.210 --> 01:59.760
have left a million men in Germany, they'd never 
have another world war.

02:03.566 --> 02:04.527
But they didn't do that. So immediately shortly 
thereafter, I became re-affiliated with Marine

02:06.289 --> 02:12.638
Corps and was appointed a captain of the Marine 
Corps reserve. And I served, as I say, in many

02:13.900 --> 02:24.145
assignments, active duty for training each year, 
attended schools, Jackson, Barrack, New

02:13.900 --> 02:24.145
Orleans, where we studied the draft act and 
promoted to major. I didn't go in detail all these

02:25.067 --> 02:27.994
different assignments, Could you describe the 
reserve organization during the inter-year

02:28.143 --> 02:34.735
wars? Could you describe what it was like to be a 
reserve in 1920? Oh, there was no such thing. I

02:38.722 --> 02:42.409
wasn't a reserve officer in World War I. I was a 
regular officer. I know that, but after you

02:42.429 --> 02:47.198
left... Yeah. First, could you tell me, did you 
ever think about staying in the Marines as a

02:47.633 --> 02:53.622
profession, as a career in 1920? Yes, I did. Why 
didn't you? The reason I wanted to stay was I had a

02:56.886 --> 03:04.257
brother back here who was bugging me to get out 
because he said he wanted me to go in business with

02:56.886 --> 03:04.257
him. He had had some oil leases up in McCullough 
County and was in show business and had a well, an

03:04.317 --> 03:13.590
outfit to clean oil wells and so forth and so on. I 
didn't want to get out of the Marine Corps at all,

03:13.908 --> 03:17.311
period. But anyhow. You enjoyed being a Marine. I 
enjoyed being a Marine. I didn't want to get out of

03:20.514 --> 03:29.142
the Marine Corps at all, but he reminded me that he 
helped me through college and so forth, and I owed

03:20.514 --> 03:29.142
him something, which I felt I didn't. However, I 
regret that I didn't turn my back on and could have

03:29.622 --> 03:35.628
stayed in the Marine Corps and didn't. But 
however, I became affiliated, and I don't regret

03:35.648 --> 03:41.653
that. It created a lot of inconvenience, but I 
didn't care anything about that either. Okay, so

03:45.192 --> 03:47.835
in 1920, you came back to Houston then? Came back to 
Houston. Okay. I built the building out in Fifth

03:49.977 --> 03:53.642
Ward for my brother, a theater. A theater. Which 
one? Well, it's called the Roxson Theater. That

03:57.887 --> 03:58.908
was way back down there. But it was in the 
neighborhood where they had whites and blacks and

03:59.429 --> 04:03.393
everything like that, and I hated show business. I 
didn't want anything like that because I had

04:03.413 --> 04:08.940
worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
and I served in the ring corps with honor. and all

04:09.325 --> 04:12.129
like that, and I didn't like the show business, 
didn't like it at all. You didn't like the people in

04:12.329 --> 04:15.793
show business, or what didn't you like about it? I 
didn't want show business. I wanted something

04:17.055 --> 04:18.076
else. Yeah, I was trained in agriculture. I had 
dreams of being an agriculturist on a large scale.

04:24.124 --> 04:24.424
Yeah. And all of that, but there I was. But anyhow, I 
went on that on, and then a little bit later on, I got

04:28.690 --> 04:37.241
in the knack of business with him and accumulated a 
little property. What kind of agribusiness? What

04:39.481 --> 04:40.342
kind of what? What kind of business? Real estate. 
Oh, real estate business. That's right. In

04:45.229 --> 04:45.850
Houston here. Acquiring real estate, rental 
property and things like that. Later on... This is

04:53.181 --> 04:54.443
during the 1920s then. 2030s up in there. I was 
licensed as a lawyer in 32. Okay, well, tell me

05:02.370 --> 05:05.176
about why did you decide to go to law. Did you go to 
law school or did you study law? Tell me about how

05:07.500 --> 05:09.044
did you become a lawyer? Well, in the Marine Corps, 
every officer was a law officer. Every officer

05:13.894 --> 05:15.477
could be a judge advocate. Every officer could be a 
incidental. That's one of the things we learned in

05:17.762 --> 05:19.866
Marine Corps schools. You could be a recorder on a 
summary court. You could run a summary court. You

05:26.185 --> 05:27.287
could be a prosecutor. We've taught all that. 
Every Marine officer's loss and every Marine

05:29.329 --> 05:39.301
officer aboard a battleship was the judge 
advocate who ran all the courts aboard ship. So

05:39.321 --> 05:42.024
they taught it back in the school.

05:45.068 --> 05:49.313
Becoming a lawyer was a matter that I had become 
involved with my brother and he was We'd acquired

05:50.373 --> 05:52.276
something and it was questioned. Anyhow, about 
that time I had put my wife in dental school. When

05:58.945 --> 05:59.886
did you get married?

06:02.630 --> 06:04.913
I got married twice. I got a child by prior 
marriage. One daughter, she's got five

06:06.776 --> 06:09.519
daughters, lived down in Louisiana. But I've been 
married to this woman since 1927, I think it is.

06:15.668 --> 06:16.549
Anyhow, So I went to the South Texas School of Law 
down in YMCA and I realized that being over that

06:16.850 --> 06:36.040
couple of months that I'd had a lot of experience in 
business, I'd had a lot of experience in court work

06:16.850 --> 06:36.040
in the Marine Corps, and I decided I didn't have any 
time to waste sitting around listening to people

06:38.365 --> 06:40.127
reciting class. So I went to the Houston Law School 
where they threw the course at you in three years,

06:40.147 --> 06:48.939
summer and winter, and then you took the bar 
examination and you took it from there. So you

06:48.999 --> 06:50.581
passed the bar in 1932. It is, okay.

06:56.629 --> 07:01.556
But being a lawyer in the Marine Corps helped me 
quite a bit, too. How? It enhanced, because they

07:02.257 --> 07:06.162
figured lawyers could make decisions. They 
figured lawyers could reason things out. They

07:09.492 --> 07:11.374
figured lawyers could do a lot of things. And a lot 
of our commanding generals were lawyers. My

07:14.197 --> 07:16.760
General Vogel was a lawyer, a graduate of George 
Washington. And General Price was a lawyer. All of

07:20.825 --> 07:22.687
them, but they had had that training. So as I say, 
when I... So I said, I said many a time that I could do

07:25.931 --> 07:31.397
the training, and he tended to say, all right. Now, 
let's get back... That's when, that's where I

07:31.417 --> 07:35.642
realized... as I do today, the importance of 
bringing the draft back immediately. Because

07:40.089 --> 07:42.573
that's where you get a cross-section of 
everybody. And before long, Reagan is going to

07:43.674 --> 07:51.607
have to give up because... Give up what? What do you 
mean? Give up on the draft. Have to give up on it. I

07:59.339 --> 08:00.220
believe in the draft. I believe we have to have a 
cross-section of all people. You understand? You

08:05.305 --> 08:15.156
just can't have...

08:15.176 --> 08:20.181
So in other words,

08:15.176 --> 08:20.181
you support the draft. I support the draft more so 
after I went and took this course in Jackson

08:20.381 --> 08:24.185
Barracks. Okay, okay. Tell me about that course. 
Well, the course was... You know, the draft act was

08:31.124 --> 08:39.377
set up in World War I by the Honorable Andrew 
Johnson, who was head of the National Recovery

08:31.124 --> 08:39.377
Act. And we had five of his administrators there 
teaching us how to administer the act, what to look

08:40.098 --> 08:51.896
for, how to pick out homosexuals, and all of those 
kind of things. And how to administer the act when

08:54.380 --> 08:59.528
time came and all like that. And the executive 
officer of that school, believe it or not, was

09:00.571 --> 09:06.904
Major Hussey. He had been shot in one eye in France,

09:06.924 --> 09:17.685
who later became head of the draft until he died. I 
was always wanting to know what he thought about

09:18.880 --> 09:21.303
me. He gave me a good fitness report. We attended 
this with five regular marine officers and five

09:23.505 --> 09:28.590
reserve officers. General Hershey did? No, no, 
no, no. Marines going to this school at Jackson

09:31.353 --> 09:35.057
Barracks. National Guard, Army, Navy, Coast 
Guard, everything. Everybody was going, okay.

09:40.383 --> 09:40.643
Right. Okay. And he told me, and I didn't know he was 
going to put it in my record at the time I... of an

09:49.019 --> 09:59.011
emergency in time of war that I'd be better off in 
the field with commanding men than I would be

09:49.019 --> 09:59.011
trying to administer this act in some state 
capital. I thought it was quite an honor. Sure. But

10:02.155 --> 10:05.118
I didn't want that, but anyhow, I had the knowledge 
about the draft. Okay, good. Where were we now? No,

10:08.062 --> 10:14.429
I wanted to, when did you join, when did you get 
involved with the reserves? When I was

10:15.350 --> 10:18.334
recommissioned. Okay, when were you 
recommissioned?

10:23.976 --> 10:30.448
In 1920, you resigned, and then when did you get 
back in as a Marine Corps Reserve? See what that

10:31.911 --> 10:36.881
commission is right there. 1927. Okay, 1927. So 
you got out of the service in 1920, and then you went

10:40.350 --> 10:45.898
back in 1927. Yeah, but that commission dated on. 
It really was 1926. That's how I don't match the

10:50.564 --> 10:53.568
material. Okay, 1926. But it all during that time 
that I was around Marines here in Houston. Mm-hmm.

11:02.260 --> 11:07.727
And

11:02.260 --> 11:07.727
we had a camaraderie... Well, we met all 
ex-Marines.

11:12.442 --> 11:17.670
We had the McLemore Detachment of the Marine Corps 
League. There's a medal sitting over yonder if you

11:17.730 --> 11:20.534
want to take a look at it. There, right there. 
There, down there.

11:29.428 --> 11:31.672
So I really never ceased being a Marine. Right. And 
what was it like? Did you get paid being in the

11:35.432 --> 11:38.857
Marines when you went back in in 1926, 27? Yes, 
every time I went on active duty I got paid. And did

11:42.342 --> 11:44.385
you go on active duty on the weekends? No, no, no, 
no, no. Those days there was no organized reserve.

11:49.312 --> 11:50.294
Okay, tell me about that. The only time we got paid 
is when we went on active duty for training. So we

11:56.684 --> 12:02.993
went to Quantico, Virginia, and a lot of times I'd 
join a battalion that's going to be...

12:08.373 --> 12:09.875
What were we talking about? Well, we were talking 
about what it was like to be in the Marine Corps

12:09.895 --> 12:13.379
Reserves. And you were talking about if they paid 
you, or we were talking about paying and going on.

12:20.208 --> 12:23.332
Did you go for, like, two-week summer camps? Yeah. 
Okay, and that's when the Marines paid you. But

12:27.036 --> 12:30.781
otherwise, when you just met, they didn't pay. Is 
that correct? No. Okay, and how often did you meet?

12:37.509 --> 12:38.110
You mean the... Did I take that down? What did I do? I 
have this right here. Where's my copy? Here, use

12:45.675 --> 12:48.618
that one. Oh, no, no, no, hell no. Goddamn, I'm 
nuts, you know. Yeah. Oh, okay, there it

12:54.124 --> 13:00.852
is. I had put in to have a reserve company in 
Houston, a reserve battalion. But I wasn't strong

13:09.292 --> 13:18.622
politically, and they gave it to the Honorable 
Clark Thompson down in Galveston, who was kin to

13:09.292 --> 13:18.622
the Moody's and all like that, so he had the 15th 
Battalion.

13:24.649 --> 13:29.875
Okay, so you didn't get the battalion, or you 
didn't get the reserve unit yourself? No, I did

13:29.955 --> 13:30.536
not. I went to Galveston and called the 15th 
Battalion. Okay. Under Clark Thompson, who was

13:34.874 --> 13:46.850
the son-in-law of the Moody's, and had been an 
ex-Congressman, or was going to be a Congressman.

13:46.870 --> 13:47.851
So were you in his unit? No, I was never in his unit, 
only for training in the summertime. We went to

13:51.856 --> 14:03.632
Palacios, we went to, where the

13:51.856 --> 14:03.632
hell was that place, Beauregard in Louisiana, and 
we went to, oh, various other places where they

14:04.000 --> 14:06.203
would meet. One time we went as far as Quantico, 
Virginia. Really? Yeah. Anyhow, but as I say, I

14:11.851 --> 14:19.981
went on and did my training and did what I was 
supposed to do. And I was promoted to major after

14:21.083 --> 14:25.829
taking the professional examination in 1940. And 
the funny thing about that, I received a letter

14:25.929 --> 14:33.079
from an Aggie by the name of Walker later on got to be 
a lieutenant general, and I used to haze him in B

14:33.633 --> 14:39.201
Company at A&M College. Oh, really? And he wrote me 
a letter and said, you are qualified physically,

14:40.964 --> 14:50.638
educationally, morally, but not 
professionally. And unless you complete certain

14:50.658 --> 14:58.830
work within a certain time, we will have to retire 
you from the Marine Corps Reserve. So I wrote to

14:59.992 --> 15:03.996
Marine Corps school and found out what I had to do 
and what they wanted. And I went down to Gauss to a

15:04.776 --> 15:19.670
friend of mine who was inspecting instructors, 
Lieutenant Colonel down there, Marines who had

15:04.776 --> 15:19.670
served with him in the tropics, Colonel Holmes, 
and he schooled me about three months. And then he

15:20.491 --> 15:28.058
announced me ready and I went down and took the 
professional examination and I was made a major

15:20.491 --> 15:28.058
shortly thereafter. But the only thing, I was glad 
I took the course because it made me

15:29.152 --> 15:34.818
professionally fit. And they gave me all the 
courses, they gave me the works, and I took it.

15:40.904 --> 15:53.896
Later on I found out other people had been made 
major without taking the examination, but also in

15:40.904 --> 15:53.896
my own mind felt that I was better off than they were 
because I was qualified enough for what I was doing

15:40.904 --> 15:53.896
than they were not. And what did these courses deal 
with? What type of topics? Small wars, the machine

15:58.075 --> 16:27.238
gun and defense, the machine gun and attack, the 
oceanography,

15:58.075 --> 16:27.238
ship to shore movements, techniques and tactics, 
artillery and defense, and

15:58.075 --> 16:27.238
logistics, and...

16:36.044 --> 16:58.288
writing orders for an attack, and carrying

16:36.044 --> 16:58.288
a campaign from its inception, the intelligence 
part of it, and this, that, and the other, until you

16:36.044 --> 16:58.288
brought it right to the combination where either 
one of you lost supplies and all that,

16:36.044 --> 16:58.288
transportation. And as I say, it gives a full 
course on small wars, which we fought in the

16:58.977 --> 17:09.568
tropics in Haiti and San Domingo and Nicaragua. 
There's another thing I was interested in, and

17:09.588 --> 17:20.901
that was, were you building a law practice in 
Houston while you were being a reserve officer

17:09.588 --> 17:20.901
then? Well, we stopped there, and as I say, I opened 
a law office in the Shell building. and had my other

17:29.555 --> 17:32.258
real estate and theater interests, too. And I was 
associated with T.J. We represented mortgage

17:33.280 --> 17:40.128
loan bank at T.J. Bettison. Incidentally, I 
became associated with an Aggie by the name of

17:40.148 --> 17:49.600
Frank R. Gwynn, whose father came up there at Russ, 
Texas. And he was a fifth generation lawyer, and

17:49.620 --> 17:53.385
he's a fine lawyer. That was mostly my practice, 
mortgage loan, probate work, and little

17:54.226 --> 18:09.241
corporation work, and very little criminal work. 
Now, you were promoted to major in June of 1940. Can

18:11.823 --> 18:14.026
you tell me what happened then? All right. Soon 
after that, just prior

18:16.168 --> 18:23.575
to this appointment, I had been out in San Diego 
with the 15th Battalion, and when I arrived home, I

18:24.061 --> 18:35.936
had orders on my desk asking me to organize a Marine 
Battalion in Houston. Bet you were happy about

18:35.956 --> 18:37.057
that. Yes, well I tried, and I had got two companies 
together, and they made us come on to active duty,

18:37.558 --> 18:49.613
and they joined and merged into 2nd Battalion, 8th 
Marines, I got a whole lot of damn pictures on that

18:37.558 --> 18:49.613
in there, of the troops. I said, you could just go 
on, hell, how damn it be that much. Nobody wants to

18:53.440 --> 18:54.742
read that much. You want to be brief, concise, just 
like the book I had, which I loaned a fellow, the

18:55.983 --> 19:02.790
generals after Appomattox. It went along there, 
it said about Lawrence Sullivan Ross and all that.

19:10.518 --> 19:12.940
He did so many things, but hell, he got it all 
condensed down. I understand all that. I said, we

19:14.502 --> 19:16.724
could just look, pile it that high. Okay. Now, what 
did you do in the Battalion 8th Marines? Tell me

19:21.651 --> 19:22.271
about that. What were your functions and duties 
there? In the 2nd Battalion 8th Marines,

19:24.654 --> 19:47.595
my outfit just went to the 2nd Battalion 8th 
Marines, and immediately, as a major, they had no

19:24.654 --> 19:47.595
room for me, so I went up to the regimental staff as a 
law officer and personnel and so forth and so on.

19:47.879 --> 19:49.260
See? Sure. Additional duty as a member of the 
general court martial down in the Navy District.

19:55.026 --> 19:56.967
So you took care of the legal work then? Sure, I drew 
up wills, but I was in personnel. Right. Sure. See?

20:04.194 --> 20:05.115
I was in personnel. All right. That was in the 8th 
Marines. And then later on, the 8th Marines shut

20:09.499 --> 20:11.361
off. I transferred all my activities to the 2nd 
Marine Division, which I didn't put in here.

20:15.805 --> 20:15.945
Mm-hmm. See, then I went to the Corps, the Corps 
staff when I'm back, and that's where I was when

20:17.528 --> 20:29.983
they took me away from that staff to send me to Samoa 
because I'll tell you why. Okay. But when did you go

20:31.244 --> 20:32.926
active duty? When did you change from a reserve? 
December, when they called us in December 1940.

20:39.674 --> 20:43.198
Okay, December 1940, you went active duty. Were 
you happy to be back on active duty? Of course, I

20:48.598 --> 20:54.986
left my business and everything else, but that 
didn't make any difference to me. I was happy. I

20:55.266 --> 21:01.074
just turned my stuff over to other people and 
whatever they did with it, they put the money in

20:55.266 --> 21:01.074
their pocket, whatever they did, that was that. 
That didn't make any difference. Because the

21:02.415 --> 21:08.623
reason I always was affiliated, because I always 
knew that what Pershing said was true. They would

21:08.664 --> 21:11.587
have another war unless we leave a million men in 
Germany. The truth would be right. All right. So

21:16.982 --> 21:22.127
you thought you'd be going back, and you thought 
the United States would be certainly going back?

21:22.147 --> 21:22.728
Sure. Okay, into the war. You had Hitler, and you 
had all that stuff. And I will say one thing about, I

21:27.693 --> 21:37.862
belonged to the America's Club here in Houston, 
which was a bunch of Italian, people of Italian

21:27.693 --> 21:37.862
parentage, professionals. And they were always 
bragging about Mussolini. But one day I got up and

21:42.747 --> 21:45.670
made a speech that was very unpopular I said that 
the Romans gave us our laws and out of those laws we

21:46.426 --> 21:59.587
bolded a constitution and we developed one of the 
greatest countries in the world, the United

21:46.426 --> 21:59.587
States of America. Yet where this law emanated, 
back in Italy, they had to resort to dictatorship

22:00.027 --> 22:08.541
which would fall, which would fall. That same year 
I went to St. Louis on a Marine, American Legion

22:13.173 --> 22:16.057
convention. I went with a fellow named Chido who 
was going to be decorated by the Italian

22:16.097 --> 22:25.650
government and went up to the Italian council up in 
some building in St. Louis. And he had a picture of

22:26.151 --> 22:29.015
Mussolini and it was blowing out from the wall. And 
this guy said, oh, look how great a man he is. And I

22:34.182 --> 22:35.644
said, he's just full of wind. That wind is blowing 
him away from the wall. The fellow I was with who's

22:40.291 --> 22:42.293
going to get this decorated, stepped on my foot. He 
says, can't you be a gentleman? I said, I'm only

22:44.275 --> 22:50.922
telling the truth, and I knew what was going to 
happen, and it did happen.

22:50.942 --> 22:51.423
All right. So when you went in December 1940, you 
were active duty again, and tell me what you did.

22:57.609 --> 22:58.891
You went to San Diego then? That's right. Okay. I 
went to San Diego, and that's where the

23:01.093 --> 23:07.480
headquarters of the The 1st and 8th Marines 
Regiment, and then the 2nd Marine Division, then

23:07.949 --> 23:14.981
the One-Eyed Mac. And what is the One-Eyed Mac? 
What does that mean? That meant the outfit that was

23:17.846 --> 23:20.931
going to run Guadalcanal Show. Oh, okay. That was 
the code of it. Okay. But I was taken away from that

23:25.899 --> 23:32.430
staff and sent to... Samoa. Samoa. and joined the 
brigade down there in American Samoa. Was that

23:37.454 --> 23:38.756
1942? Yeah. That was the idea was to support the 
Tarawa operation. That was the idea of

23:43.682 --> 23:53.255
reactivating those islands there, American 
Samoa, Western Samoa, and the Wallace Island,

23:43.682 --> 23:53.255
which is the French Samoa. And I was the first and 
only Marine officer in American Samoa to support

23:54.537 --> 23:59.944
Tarawa operation. What did you do there at Samoa? 
Wait a minute. When I arrived there, I went out to

24:07.242 --> 24:16.730
brigade to see my friend, my commanding general, 
who I'd served with in the Marines, and another

24:07.242 --> 24:16.730
friend of mine, Raymond Knapp. And I asked him, why 
did you all take me away from General Vogel? And he

24:20.814 --> 24:29.381
said, well, the attorney general has been held on 
this island for many years by our Navy people. And

24:29.781 --> 24:31.703
they're so soft, they have never talked to me. the 
people how to work on these islands. And we were

24:35.252 --> 24:41.199
looking for a lawyer, we were looking for a 
southerner, we were looking for an

24:35.252 --> 24:41.199
administrator, we were looking for a marine. 
Because the guy who's coming here, although he is a

24:41.620 --> 24:47.566
marine, he's a graduate of the Naval Academy, and 
we don't think much of him. So he tapped me. So the

24:50.169 --> 24:51.971
commanding... Why do you want a southerner? Why do 
you say, I want a southerner? That's what they

24:54.695 --> 24:55.556
said.

24:59.420 --> 25:01.302
Because a lot of them people were black, too. 
Anyhow, that's what they said. I don't mean to, you

25:04.679 --> 25:06.883
know, I don't want to stuff anything. You can 
delete that if you want. I don't care. So, I was the

25:11.090 --> 25:19.383
first and only Marine officer serving the 10th 
General and Pro-War Marshals and the Military

25:11.090 --> 25:19.383
Governor of Samoan and the Samoan Defense 
Brigade. See reports on tenure of Officer of the

25:19.784 --> 25:22.969
Water and Navy Accommodation Medal with ribbon 
for said service. OK, General Nunn. Tell me what

25:29.552 --> 25:31.419
you did in Samoa. I'm OK right now. OK, good. I want 
to know what you did in Samoa.

25:59.872 --> 26:05.020
Okay, that's your Samoa file.

26:05.080 --> 26:05.521
Okay. There's some material there to start a book 
with. Anyhow, the idea was my commanding general

26:11.090 --> 26:26.694
told me that they wanted, as the attorney general 
for Oklahoma Marshal, I was executive officer of

26:11.090 --> 26:26.694
the naval government. Executive officer. I 
signed my name to 22 different titles. No kidding?

26:43.065 --> 26:51.360
All right, I was the lawyer, the high lawyer, 
attorney general, who was executive officer of

26:43.065 --> 26:51.360
the government.

26:56.791 --> 27:04.421
The Provo March was a Samoan area, all in combined, 
but all they gave it to me, they said, you got the law

26:56.791 --> 27:04.421
west of the Pecos, take it all. I was a V.C. officer 
for the State Department. I'd get permits to the

27:10.468 --> 27:13.712
Line Islands for a sewer. I was officer of the Navy 
Bank in Samoa. I was head of the Labor Board. I was

27:20.281 --> 27:22.504
head of the, I was on the Custom Board. I was warden 
of the Naval Prisons. I was warden of the native

27:25.141 --> 27:28.945
prison. I was head of tax collecting. I was head of 
tax assessment. I was head of the Department of

27:33.129 --> 27:34.891
Agriculture. I was head of the Department of 
Native Industries, like that thing you see over

27:35.912 --> 27:44.461
there on the wall, that club thing like that. I was 
head of the Department of Native... I was legal

27:49.006 --> 27:51.368
representative of the island government. I was a 
prosecutor in the criminal court. I had power

27:55.982 --> 27:57.443
adoption. I was a trustee for the Mormon Ranch. I 
was area assignment security officer. I was head

28:05.454 --> 28:07.136
of the liquor control board. I was a brand major, 
which means a fire marshal. And I was on the

28:11.261 --> 28:15.166
hospital board. You did all of that? I did that. I 
had 22 different battles. 22. Did you ever have

28:20.893 --> 28:22.215
time to sleep? Damn little. Damn little. All 
right, for my service, I don't mind being

28:27.175 --> 28:39.995
braggadocious about it, but there is my, there are 
my annual reports for my two years, practically

28:27.175 --> 28:39.995
two years of tenure of office. There they are right 
there. Where we go into a whole lot of stuff. The

28:45.443 --> 28:47.046
Native industry. Tell me how you got along with the 
Samoan people. I got along with Samoan people

28:50.005 --> 28:53.249
because I was firm and I was fair. When I set up the 
labor board, I meant no partiality. I had power to

28:58.996 --> 29:01.579
appoint the governors from the four districts. 
And these four districts came from Samoan. And we

29:05.804 --> 29:08.367
operated through the chief. And I well remember 
the first speech I made. My commanding general

29:11.691 --> 29:15.135
told me to go down there and look at the laws. They 
were in existence, change any of them by direction

29:16.313 --> 29:30.370
to suit the job, get on with the war so that the 
natives could cooperate, so our Marines could go

29:16.313 --> 29:30.370
on in training instead of unloading ships. And so 
the Navy was sitting down there expecting to build

29:31.631 --> 29:39.300
a Navy base, which never happened, and they never 
unloaded any ships. So the idea was to get us there,

29:43.060 --> 29:53.072
get the natives to do the work, work unloading 
ships, work on the roads, and do things so that

29:43.060 --> 29:53.072
Marines and other people could be released and get 
on with the training. Didn't they do the work? All

29:55.215 --> 29:58.099
this stuff, these are the annual reports. Did the 
Samoans do the work? The Samoans did their work.

30:01.222 --> 30:07.410
They never had anybody's bad eye on them because 
the Navy had what they called a feeder-feeder

30:01.222 --> 30:07.410
guard there. And through that feeder-feeder 
guard, which was formed in 1904, They lived, the

30:12.608 --> 30:15.091
whole island. They didn't have to work. They just 
sat down and fished and grow taro and this, that,

30:16.152 --> 30:20.517
and the other. They didn't have to do any work. They 
didn't have to work. The sea was full of fish.

30:32.030 --> 30:35.374
So how'd you get them to take over these new duties 
now? I'm sure I'll tell you in a minute.

31:28.445 --> 31:39.196
So on my way back from brigade headquarters, I 
stopped at my military police headquarters to

31:28.445 --> 31:39.196
announce them that I was their new provost 
marshal. I was at Utilee, so I had an office down

31:39.216 --> 31:42.119
there, too.

31:45.583 --> 31:46.884
Feet of field guard, you can have that. Those are 
the people whose salaries filtered through every

31:48.726 --> 31:56.494
native community and family on the island. 
Feeder, feeder, put it on back there. Feeder,

31:59.821 --> 32:00.945
feeder, go. F-I-T-E, F-I-T-E. All right.

32:08.431 --> 32:09.454
Here, you can have this.

32:33.970 --> 32:38.334
How'd you get the people to take over work? So when I 
reported, I was immediately assigned a jeep.

32:44.039 --> 32:45.621
The Attorney General had a station wagon. I said, I 
didn't want that.

33:00.174 --> 33:03.117
I went down to this office of the Attorney General. 
And the first person I saw was a barefooted Samoan

33:04.987 --> 33:16.601
with a shark lay around his neck, barefooted and a 
lava lava. So I said to him, what's your job? He

33:19.084 --> 33:20.826
says, I'm your chief of police. My name is Paley. 
Paley means strong in Samoan. So I said to him, I am

33:27.174 --> 33:30.758
the attorney general. I'm your lawyer, Celia 
Celia, and I'm the provost of Marquis Island. And I

33:37.828 --> 33:42.976
understand by reading that we have chiefs in the 
different districts. And I want those chiefs to

33:44.378 --> 33:53.652
have as many people of their villages in this 
courtroom tomorrow morning.

33:56.977 --> 34:00.002
So as Bush telegraphed word from one to the other, 
The next morning, the courtroom was filled up, and

34:00.488 --> 34:05.535
I got up and made them a speech. And I told them I 
didn't ask for this duty. But the war was on, and we

34:09.721 --> 34:19.816
had to reorganize and disrupt their easy life 
where they could sleep all day and fish when they

34:09.721 --> 34:19.816
wanted to and grow breadfruit. And now the women do 
all the washing, and they said we had to go to work.

34:24.402 --> 34:25.744
We had to protect this country. If they want to do a 
part, in this Japanese war so they could win it.

34:31.377 --> 34:36.286
They'd have to change their lives, which I 
apologize very much for disrupting it. And we have

34:37.208 --> 34:38.671
to change things. Everybody's gonna work on this 
island. Everybody's gonna produce. We're gonna

34:42.599 --> 34:44.062
set up a labor board. Those who are physically 
qualified are gonna have to work on the roads

34:50.168 --> 34:51.729
You're going to have to keep up your own 
plantation. You're going to have to cut off the

34:51.749 --> 34:53.971
food supply. We cannot be bringing food down from 
the United States for you people when you can grow

34:54.392 --> 34:58.655
it here yourself. We're going to cut off a lot of 
other supplies, shoes and things and other that

34:59.096 --> 35:06.742
you get out of San Francisco. We're going to have to 
cut that off the, you know what I'm talking about,

35:06.863 --> 35:11.046
the list. And we're going to bring down warm 
material. We're going to bring down concrete.

35:16.391 --> 35:20.074
We're going to bring down materials, cement, and 
other materials to win the war with. And you're

35:23.595 --> 35:25.618
going to have to learn to live what you've got. And 
I'm going to only let necessities come to this

35:27.019 --> 35:30.965
island. What'd they say? They didn't say 
anything. I told them that was it. So I got through

35:35.911 --> 35:37.293
talking to them. The next morning, we had all the 
natives that could be physically able to work, all

35:37.313 --> 35:44.943
the men, report for physical examination. And the 
next morning, they went to work. We had trucks go

35:47.006 --> 35:49.369
out into the areas and pick them up. And we taught 
them how to unload ship. We taught them how to be a

35:51.860 --> 35:53.301
winchman. We taught them how to do this, how to drop 
the slings in the hole and all like that. I

35:58.568 --> 36:01.932
cooperated with the supply officer, who was a Navy 
man. I also issued an order immediately that

36:02.713 --> 36:11.683
instead of having one sling down in the hole and 
unload the ship, we're going to have four slings.

36:12.745 --> 36:19.693
And as the law officer of the island aboard ship, 
they had four rules. No stealing, no sleeping, no,

36:20.011 --> 36:41.975
let's see, sleeping, stealing,

36:20.011 --> 36:41.975
drinking, and I had one else. So we set to work, and 
first thing you know, these people went to work

36:43.156 --> 36:48.702
seriously about it. And we used the feet of feet of 
guards as guards on these ships. Everybody that

36:52.984 --> 36:54.866
came on there had to have a ticket. No sleeping, no 
smoking, no stealing. It was another asshole. I

36:58.990 --> 36:59.571
forget what it was. But anyhow, at any time anybody 
violated that, the feet of feet of guards brought

36:59.591 --> 37:06.278
him in, and I would prosecute him. And rather than 
put him in jail, I'd fine him. And I built up

37:09.601 --> 37:15.087
$300,000 or $30,000 in the hospital fund on those 
fines. Anyhow, I could hold court any time. The

37:17.791 --> 37:23.383
court consisted of one naval lieutenant 
commander and three native judges. We had no jury,

37:24.566 --> 37:29.357
so I'd write out the complaint. They'd come in and 
give me the complaint. I'd write it out. If there

37:32.885 --> 37:35.490
was any merit to it, I'd go on and prosecute. If it 
wasn't, I'd give them a warning and go on about

37:35.510 --> 37:37.555
their business. As I say, I gave you all the duties. 
I had the power of adoption. And I found out then

37:43.733 --> 37:51.225
that those natives had more sense than we do 
because they'd bring in a family who had eight

37:43.733 --> 37:51.225
children. They wouldn't adopt just one child. 
They'd adopt every other child so the kids could be

37:53.709 --> 37:56.894
raised together. Those were natives. Anyhow, my 
citation there, I won't. I did a job there, and I was

38:02.527 --> 38:25.118
the last, first and last Marine officer to ever 
hold that job because the military, the

38:02.527 --> 38:25.118
government, after I left there, went from the 
military government to the Samoan Defense Area

38:02.527 --> 38:25.118
back to the Navy, and from the Navy it went to the 
Department of the Interior, which is down there

38:02.527 --> 38:25.118
now. How'd you like that duty? I didn't like the 
duty. Why not? Because it was too... I had... I had

38:32.024 --> 38:34.147
every ship that came in there. I forgot that. Every 
ship that came in there, the skipper had to report

38:35.889 --> 38:38.832
to me. And if he was having any difficulties with 
the crew, I had power from Admiral Hawes to take him

38:39.413 --> 38:52.509
off and try him or send him back on his own 
transportation back to the United States and take

38:39.413 --> 38:52.509
him off the ship. That was some of my jobs. I had a lot 
of jobs to do. Did you ever have to do that with any

38:56.735 --> 38:58.537
captain? I did that with two or three people. I got a 
file of letters where lawyers wrote me after I went

39:01.437 --> 39:09.509
on inactive duty trying to straight them up and get 
their money back, but that didn't mean anything to

39:01.437 --> 39:09.509
me. I catch them stealing or selling whiskey on the 
beach, anything like that, and they brought them

39:10.811 --> 39:16.179
in. The skipper would come with the complaint and 
bring the defendant there, and then I'd take him

39:16.779 --> 39:23.489
from there.

39:27.836 --> 39:28.296
That was it. But I...

39:37.820 --> 39:39.041
It was a hell of a job. Another thing. Wait a minute. 
One of the things I had, I had a leper calling. I

39:43.946 --> 39:44.647
forgot that. Oh, you really? Give me a... Where's 
that damn thing? I forgot. Right here. That right

39:50.112 --> 39:50.713
there? No, I don't want that. You

39:53.496 --> 40:00.983
want a pen? Leper calling up on the side of the 
mountain. And I also ran the nut house. Crazy

40:06.228 --> 40:06.949
house.

40:12.025 --> 40:13.227
I had a feeder running that. One day he let a damn 
crazy guy get in there and drown. And he come

40:17.072 --> 40:21.218
telling me, I said, I just warned you last week. The 
ship was very well out of the water, and his name was

40:22.980 --> 40:27.226
Pai Tata. And he hit one of them natives who had a 
fake sardine can for a number. And he hit him and

40:35.277 --> 40:38.742
knocked him all down the ladder, and he hit the 
other guy. Every step on them buses, they had wide

40:38.958 --> 40:41.181
open. I had to relieve him of that, so I sent him over 
to the nut house, and next week he come over, he done

40:41.782 --> 40:48.812
drowned one of those poor crazy people. Oh, 
Christ. Well, who was your commanding general

40:51.516 --> 40:54.880
then? Was there a general in charge? There he is 
right there, General Henry L. Lawson. Lawson?

41:01.109 --> 41:01.650
That's right. Okay. He married. And so you were his 
assistant, more or less. No, this was back in his

41:07.221 --> 41:10.404
assistant. I was his provost and lieutenant 
general. He was the military governor. Okay, he

41:14.248 --> 41:15.710
was the military governor. This was back in Guam 
where I got the Legion of Merit.

41:27.802 --> 41:27.903
Okay. The... My duties in Samoa are covered by this 
citation. Meritorious conduct in the

41:37.820 --> 41:54.318
performance of outstanding service to the 
government of the United States as Attorney

41:37.820 --> 41:54.318
General and Provo Marshal of the Military 
Government of America of Samoa from July 29, 1942

41:37.820 --> 41:54.318
to the 18th of November, 1943. During this 
critical period, he was charged with the

41:55.440 --> 41:59.404
maintaining law and order among military and 
civilian personnel, prosecuting all actions

41:59.840 --> 42:14.437
before the court for the island government, 
indoctrinating natives with the principles of

41:59.840 --> 42:14.437
war or effort, and numerous additional duties of 
importance. His astute diplomacy and

42:15.238 --> 42:28.193
extraordinary administrative and professional 
abilities aided materially in fostering a real

42:15.238 --> 42:28.193
consciousness of obligation by the civilians as 
well as the military military personnel to the

42:28.797 --> 42:32.042
United States government in time of war. His 
conduct was all the time in keeping with the

42:32.602 --> 42:37.529
highest tradition of naval service. That tells 
you what my job, what I did. But a lot of people don't

42:40.874 --> 42:43.417
know about all this other stuff. Well, of course, 
there's instances I could go on and elaborate and

42:43.457 --> 42:50.748
so forth and so on, you know what I mean? Now... Did 
you think that Europe, that you did, that, uh, The

42:55.375 --> 43:04.187
most difficult chore was to getting the Samoan 
people to get used to the war effort and all those

42:55.375 --> 43:04.187
changes? They were not. They were for a little 
while there, but I had very little resistance

43:05.549 --> 43:12.438
because they knew I was fair and I was stern. Yeah. 
Now, a lot of times there's some Marine officer who

43:14.621 --> 43:20.650
comes right in the seat for some native that I had in 
the jail. Mm-hmm. So, uh, I'd look at him, I says, do

43:24.653 --> 43:31.880
I ever come over to your 50 caliber group and tell 
you how to run your battery? He said, no, sir. I

43:32.560 --> 43:33.621
said, why don't you come over here? I said, you're 
doing push-push with the man's sister, you're

43:33.961 --> 43:38.586
right. He said, yes, sir. I said, well, you better 
get on over there before I lock you up. So I put him

43:43.630 --> 43:45.692
under arrest as Provo Marshal. I had the military 
law, I had the civil law, I had it all. And General

43:49.436 --> 43:50.917
Lawson gave me that. Later on after General Lawson 
left, I was under the Samoan Defense Command. And

43:56.614 --> 44:00.219
after that, of course, I was relieved and came on 
back to the States. Oh, tell me about that. All

44:01.821 --> 44:02.342
right. Returned to the United States. Why were you 
relieved of that duty? Because my time was up. I'd

44:08.571 --> 44:09.873
given them everything. Okay. And I didn't want to 
stay there after my commanding general left, who

44:10.273 --> 44:14.159
caught me there. Okay. Okay, fine. I didn't have 
any. They knew. They knew what to do. Okay. See, so

44:20.768 --> 44:22.751
they went back to the old ways. Okay. Nonchalant. I 
well remember one time. So the Samoans went to the

44:27.321 --> 44:30.164
old ways then? They went different ways. They 
bettered themselves, but they were not under the

44:31.806 --> 44:36.191
pressure of war. Okay, fine. I well remember down 
there in Samoa that the

44:37.954 --> 44:53.132
airplane tender came in there to take certain 
personnel from the 2nd Defense Battalion away,

44:37.954 --> 44:53.132
and I was down on the dock. And the skipper of the 
ship was ready to shove off. And he was wanting a

45:02.858 --> 45:04.780
pilot to take him out. So he hollered down at me and 
said, who runs this place? I said, no, I don't.

45:10.007 --> 45:12.090
Well, he says, well, this pilot's going to take me 
out. I said, well, I think they're out there. He

45:16.716 --> 45:21.583
said, yeah, but I think they're coming back with a 
couple of tuna boats. So he yelled from the bridge,

45:22.694 --> 45:28.101
says, you people must think I'm sitting on an 
Evinrude motor hill. I'm going to shove off here

45:29.422 --> 45:32.146
myself without a pilot. And with that, he did.

45:36.751 --> 45:37.172
That's right. Anyhow, so much for Samoa. And I 
returned to the United States.

45:46.624 --> 45:50.288
And I was legal officer of the Fleet and Marine 
Forces San Diego area. And I was a G2, I wanted to put

45:51.517 --> 46:00.508
two and I got, let me get a pencil in here. I got GF, I 
mean G2, intelligence. Chief of staff, later

46:05.554 --> 46:09.399
chief of staff, the same.

46:13.203 --> 46:16.747
So you became the chief legal officer then? No, no, 
no. That was the first job I had. Okay. Then I was, G2

46:21.723 --> 46:24.928
is intelligence and legal officer. Okay. And then 
I was made chief of staff. I had all these other

46:27.413 --> 46:28.935
people under me. Okay, okay. How many men did you 
have under you as chief of staff? Well, we had

46:33.583 --> 46:34.685
50,000 people. We had all the people in the San 
Diego area. You ought to put San Diego area. Yeah,

46:39.493 --> 46:40.334
you have that. I have. All right. And what rank were 
you at this time? I was still a lieutenant colonel.

46:46.605 --> 46:47.967
Okay, a lieutenant colonel. Anyhow, we had Camp 
Pendleton, we had Camp Elliott, we had Camp

46:48.925 --> 47:00.582
Gillespie, we had Camp Matthews, we had all these 
places under this same outfit. It was commanded by

47:01.864 --> 47:03.627
a general, General Vogel. See, who had me?
