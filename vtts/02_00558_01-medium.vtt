00:29.377 --> 00:39.006
This interview with Father Dennis Farkasvalve 
took place on November 20, 1982, at the Cistercian

00:29.377 --> 00:39.006
Abbey of Our Lady of Dallas in Irving, Texas. The 
interviewer is Michael Burns. This interview

00:43.570 --> 00:52.538
concerns Father Dennis' interpretation of the 
Hungarian Revolt of October of 1956, at which he

00:43.570 --> 00:52.538
was present.

00:55.361 --> 00:56.802
Father Dennis Farkasvalve, How old were you when 
the revolution in Hungary started? 20

00:59.916 --> 01:14.918
years old and I was in third year of law school at the 
University of Budapest. Okay, could you explain

01:15.059 --> 01:17.302
to me your role in the revolution? I don't think 
that I played a role, although I might say that I

01:18.143 --> 01:25.354
have done exactly what the hundreds and thousands 
of university students and high school students

01:26.026 --> 01:30.131
did. Namely, I participated in the first large 
demonstration that has been the beginning of the

01:30.171 --> 01:38.842
revolution. And later on I also participated in a 
few more gatherings. One particular gathering

01:45.070 --> 01:55.543
that was at the university itself, at which 
certain decisions were made and a new leadership

01:45.070 --> 01:55.543
was elected. But I have even received arms at the 
university, but after about half an hour of

01:56.283 --> 02:09.075
thinking it over, I decided that I'm not going to 
participate in the fighting. I felt that there was

02:09.836 --> 02:21.347
actually no chance of success, and I did not feel 
that there was any point of risking more lives.

02:21.367 --> 02:22.408
Okay. I'd like to talk about the feelings and the 
moods leading up to the revolution. well the

02:26.540 --> 02:50.792
feelings and the moods go back probably to the 
middle of the summer of 1956

02:26.540 --> 02:50.792
there was an erosion of the terror system in 
Hungary and also there was a feeling that the party

02:26.540 --> 02:50.792
itself was divided and the liberal wing liberal in 
the sense of asking for more individual rights,

02:51.059 --> 02:59.548
more democracy in the country, emerged. And as a 
consequence, the school year has started in a mood

03:00.529 --> 03:11.360
quite different from previous school years. The 
well-known burial of Laszlo Roik was the first

03:18.616 --> 03:28.807
event which has seen some sporadic 
demonstrations in the city of Budapest, but

03:18.616 --> 03:28.807
information about it came only through rumors. 
And then in the middle of October, in the city of

03:29.908 --> 03:44.623
Szeged, which is the second largest city of 
Hungary, about 100 miles from Budapest, a city

03:45.481 --> 04:03.881
with a university, the students have started a 
movement

03:45.481 --> 04:03.881
that was supposed to be the

03:45.481 --> 04:03.881
substitute movement for the communist youth 
movement. So, maybe very similarly to what is

04:04.862 --> 04:13.632
going on now in Poland, that a trade union 
organization free trade union organization

04:13.983 --> 04:24.795
wants to substitute for the communist-run trade 
union

04:13.983 --> 04:24.795
movement. In Hungary, the youth movement and the 
movement of university

04:24.815 --> 04:39.771
students was supposed to replace the party-run 
youth movement that was of course corrupt and

04:40.139 --> 04:48.471
totally under the influence of the party 
leadership. Now, this was an organization that

04:48.951 --> 05:06.155
tried to spread the demands of the youth among the 
students, demands for more democracy, a new

04:48.951 --> 05:06.155
government, and more freedom. Two days before I 
think two days before the

05:11.223 --> 05:38.074
revolution itself, so on the 21st of October, if I 
remember correctly, a delegation from the

05:11.223 --> 05:38.074
University of Szeged came to our university and 
gave a short speech expressing and describing the

05:11.223 --> 05:38.074
goals for which this new youth movement started. 
The professors, who at the law school were all

05:38.240 --> 06:04.249
members of the party, did not know really how to 
react, and they obviously did not receive any

05:38.240 --> 06:04.249
orders from the party what to do about this new 
youth movement, which obviously has had some

05:38.240 --> 06:04.249
support from the party itself. You might also 
remember that at the same time, in Poland, there

06:08.446 --> 06:11.809
was unrest in Gdansk. And so this youth movement 
has called for a protest march, or actually for a

06:11.829 --> 06:23.339
sympathy march on behalf of the Polish workers. 
That was the

06:24.440 --> 06:37.491
excuse or motive under which the large 
demonstration of October the 23rd, 1956 was

06:24.440 --> 06:37.491
called. And that demonstration turned into a 
revolution. Okay. That demonstration was

06:44.810 --> 07:00.570
announced, I think, a day early, on Tuesday the 
22nd, and on Wednesday the 23rd, at 3 o'clock we

06:44.810 --> 07:00.570
were supposed to be at the statue of Pateufi on the 
shore of the Danube. And that's where I also showed

07:01.531 --> 07:08.220
up, and our protest march started through the 
whole city. Okay. In this, in the march in the

07:09.708 --> 07:16.617
crowd, was it, in crowds, a lot, many times you get a 
feeling of chaos or just heat of the moment? No, the

07:16.637 --> 07:36.283
march was very well organized in the sense that it 
was very orderly, and there were banners and

07:16.637 --> 07:36.283
flags, banners identifying each group, and 
actually there are three, four large

07:16.637 --> 07:36.283
universities scattered in the city of Budapest. 
So from each university, practically all

07:40.459 --> 07:59.672
students gathered and in very orderly fashion 
moved across the city to the posted goal of the

07:40.459 --> 07:59.672
demonstration, the statue of Bem, General Bem was 
a Polish general in the anti-Habsburg revolution

08:00.378 --> 08:07.448
of 1848. And since this was a sympathy march for the 
Polish, the idea was that we would all gather at the

08:09.290 --> 08:29.659
statue of this Polish general, who 100 years or 130 
years, 120 years earlier, helped the Hungarians

08:09.290 --> 08:29.659
in their fight against the Austrians. now the 
march was also in a way very ironically composed

08:30.095 --> 08:53.773
because all the professors all the communists of 
the university participated so obviously they

08:30.095 --> 08:53.773
got from the party the order to partake in order to 
keep it under control and in order to watch who is

08:54.125 --> 09:03.118
doing the so-called provocations, that is, who is 
going to start the anti-Soviet slogans. I

09:05.421 --> 09:22.225
personally thought that all the slogans that were 
shouted for more democracy and this sort of thing

09:05.421 --> 09:22.225
was hogwash, till we finally reached, oh, maybe 
three-quarters of the route on the bridge of St.

09:05.421 --> 09:22.225
Margaret. passing from one side of the Danube to 
the other, it was at that place that I started, that

09:22.441 --> 09:44.335
I heard the first anti-Soviet slogan, and 
honestly, my feeling was, now you're talking,

09:22.441 --> 09:44.335
because that's the issue, when the famous 
Russkikhaza, Russians go home, slogan started.

09:44.855 --> 09:49.783
From then on, that has become the central issue of 
the demonstration. In other words, that whatever

09:50.774 --> 10:17.895
what was buried in everybody's heart the main 
complaint and main problem of the country erupted

09:50.774 --> 10:17.895
in the middle of the demonstration spontaneously 
and at least my feeling was that it has erupted

09:50.774 --> 10:17.895
spontaneously by the time we have reached the 
square where the statue of General Bem stands the

10:18.787 --> 10:46.650
university students picked up thousands of 
workers

10:18.787 --> 10:46.650
office and store personnel I mean people who 
populated the streets and the offices and the

10:18.787 --> 10:46.650
workplaces which we passed by we just picked up we 
we have doubled or tripled our membership in other

10:18.787 --> 10:46.650
words we just drew people out of their homes and 
offices and workplaces, and the whole city ended

10:46.968 --> 10:55.845
up being on the streets. So the university 
students were maybe just a match to the fire. Okay.

11:03.539 --> 11:09.330
Speaking of university students, it's been said 
that the Patafi Club was a group of intellectuals

11:03.539 --> 11:09.330
that started thinking of this and Again, could you 
describe your involvement or your... The Patufi

11:11.837 --> 11:34.002
Club was a group of dissident writers starting to 
meet during the summer and starting to work out a

11:11.837 --> 11:34.002
platform which of course was pretty much along the 
lines of left-wing or even socialist or you might

11:34.488 --> 12:01.710
say communist

11:34.488 --> 12:01.710
ideology and yet they try to formulate a new way of 
socialism which would be catering to the national

11:34.488 --> 12:01.710
feelings of the country would be for more freedom 
human rights or individual freedom and more

12:02.770 --> 12:12.999
independence in economic planning. The platform 
being formulated by intellectuals was something

12:13.159 --> 12:30.735
I think utopian and as opposed to what is going on in 
Poland today, very much based on an intellectual

12:31.272 --> 12:37.820
leadership rather than a trade union 
organization so led by workers. I think a lot of

12:39.523 --> 12:43.067
workers participated, but as a second step. The 
leadership element was left-wing writers, but

12:43.628 --> 12:59.388
left-wing writers who disagreed with the 
policies

12:43.628 --> 12:59.388
of the- or the official leadership of the party. 
And that shows again that there was a cracked party

13:01.343 --> 13:06.589
that allowed these developments. The party 
leadership has been torn in two ever since the

13:07.109 --> 13:16.880
death of Stalin, which was in 1953. So, the 
prehistory of the revolution is probably the

13:17.340 --> 13:29.393
internal confusion of the party which has allowed 
the emergence of a young, more liberal wing within

13:29.828 --> 13:51.491
the party itself that has appealed

13:29.828 --> 13:51.491
on to the workers and especially the youth in order 
to change the system, change the internal

13:29.828 --> 13:51.491
composition of the leadership in Hungary. They 
did not realize that the majority of the

13:55.040 --> 13:59.686
Hungarians did not want communism at all. In other 
words, this movement of the patriotic club has

14:00.327 --> 14:19.090
flipped into a nationwide revolution against the 
communist system as such, and against the

14:00.327 --> 14:19.090
Russians in particular. Could you tell me about 
the Tearing Down of Stalin statue? Were you there?

14:22.811 --> 14:30.000
The statue of Stalin, I think, was an eyesore and a 
symbol of the suppression, for sure. It stands in

14:31.061 --> 14:41.774
the middle of what is called the city park, and at 
considerable distance from my home. After the

14:43.075 --> 14:48.942
demonstration at the statue of General Vem, the 
swollen crowd on the streets took different

14:49.310 --> 14:57.160
directions. I stayed with the group that went to 
the parliament and demanded that the previous

14:57.821 --> 15:12.999
prime minister, Imre Nagy, who was somehow the 
symbol of the more liberal element in the party,

14:57.821 --> 15:12.999
would talk to us. So I stayed with that group, while 
other people went to the statue of Stalin, and a

15:19.482 --> 15:29.718
third group went to the radio station, the 
official radio station. Now, the group at the

15:30.218 --> 15:46.283
Stalin statue has worked a couple of hours in order 
to demolish the statue, but when the statue was on

15:30.218 --> 15:46.283
the ground, it was called for celebration, so the 
statue was dragged all across the city, and

15:46.550 --> 15:53.701
finally got deposited across the National 
Theater in a side street in order not to block

15:46.550 --> 15:53.701
traffic. Two or three days later, maybe it was more 
than two or three days later, I also paid my

15:54.903 --> 16:06.101
respects to the broken statue of Stalin. There was 
still a standing crowd around it and people were

16:06.922 --> 16:14.734
chiseling little souvenir pieces from the statue 
for themselves. little fragments of the statue of

16:16.975 --> 16:21.361
Stalin afterwards. But I was unable to get one 
myself, but I've seen the statue and the sort of

16:21.922 --> 16:33.737
bonfire around it a few days after it was torn down. 
Okay, Father Dennis, could you describe the

16:34.719 --> 16:38.604
massacre in Parliament Square? The massacre in 
Parliament Square I think took place on the 25th of

16:39.265 --> 16:44.572
October. After a lull following the 
demonstrations and the first fights on the

16:47.080 --> 16:52.589
streets. The first fight, really, first armed 
exchange between secret police and the

16:53.270 --> 17:03.506
revolutionaries took place at the radio, not at 
the parliament. And that was still the night of the

17:03.967 --> 17:09.055
23rd. By the way, very few people know that this 
first fight was broadcast on the radio, because

17:10.115 --> 17:35.511
they forgot to turn off the microphones in the 
radio station, so that for about half an hour, and I

17:10.115 --> 17:35.511
listened to it through the radio, you could hear, 
besides classical music, shots and exchange of

17:10.115 --> 17:35.511
shots. For about half an hour it was transmitted on 
the radio. to the whole country. That's how the

17:41.871 --> 17:51.287
country has learned everywhere about the 
revolution, that, you know, there was

17:41.871 --> 17:51.287
pandemonium in the radio station itself. But that 
was the 23rd night. Two days later, I think in the

17:56.015 --> 18:06.312
morning, at around 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning, 
a new demonstration was announced and I have seen

18:07.405 --> 18:26.815
the people, at least one large group, moving 
through the fashionable street, actually in

18:07.405 --> 18:26.815
downtown Budapest, where I also lived, and I 
accompanied them for

18:27.976 --> 18:32.382
quite a while we had some side demonstrations on 
the way. But rumors said that armed resistance

18:32.943 --> 18:42.397
will wait for us at Parliament, so I returned home. 
Again, my position and the position of my family

18:43.558 --> 18:56.076
was that precipitation of the revolution into 
armed conflict will only foretell defeat. There

18:58.864 --> 19:07.461
was no hope of coming out victorious from an armed 
confrontation with the Soviets. That was the

19:07.481 --> 19:11.148
belief that I held and my family also held. So, we 
promised each other not to get involved in the

19:11.208 --> 19:14.835
fights. So, I came home. Was this a minority view? 
This was the, I must say, the intelligent view, the

19:19.090 --> 19:30.884
less passionate and more realistic view among the 
circles of my friends. In any case, I went home and

19:32.065 --> 19:44.119
first a phone call came from friends telling that 
there is a massacre in on the square in front of the

19:44.487 --> 20:04.470
parliament then two boys boyfriends of my sister 
arrived to our home who personally came from there

19:44.487 --> 20:04.470
and escaped with their lives and ran to our home we 
were not too far away from the from the Parliament

20:04.568 --> 20:18.173
and they describe what has happened they were 
caught in the crossfire on the bridge a bridge that

20:04.568 --> 20:18.173
has been just a temporary bridge across the Danube 
in front of the Parliament And right after the

20:18.676 --> 20:23.781
revolution, the bridge was demolished. But these 
guys were hiding on the bridge and surviving the

20:24.501 --> 20:35.712
massacre between the columns of the bridge, which 
must have been eerie. In any case, these people

20:36.633 --> 20:39.275
were eyewitnesses. And while they were still in 
our home, we were able to watch from our windows We

20:48.140 --> 20:59.787
were on the sixth floor of a large apartment 
complex and we were able to watch on the street

20:48.140 --> 20:59.787
truckloads of corpses being brought. from the 
parliament square obviously to the morgue and

21:00.222 --> 21:26.635
that was eerie those corpses were just every 
everyday people just thrown on the trucks and

21:00.222 --> 21:26.635
being carried with incredible speed through the 
streets and they were not even covered so It was

21:27.458 --> 21:34.032
probably the most scariest thing that I've seen in 
those weeks. I'd like to ask you about the radio

21:36.217 --> 21:38.602
involvement. It's the Voice of America Radio Free 
Europe. Okay, well, of course, Free Europe played

21:42.477 --> 21:51.769
a very important part in our lives. You must 
realize that starting in 1948, the country became

21:52.810 --> 22:02.502
completely isolated from both the West and the 
truth. So, we did not receive information about

22:03.844 --> 22:11.353
international events, but through the 
censorship of the party. So Radio Free Europe was a

22:11.722 --> 22:17.333
very important source of information. The 
broadcasts were seriously disturbed,

22:19.237 --> 22:30.760
yet it was possible to listen to Free Europe. and a 
lot of people picked up the information from Free

22:31.347 --> 22:34.371
Europe. Now, Free Europe was considered by most of 
my contemporaries and friends as interesting

22:34.872 --> 23:00.207
and helpful, but irresponsible at the same time, 
making the West appear to us as an absolute

22:34.872 --> 23:00.207
paradise which is denied to us. Also, the 
readiness of America in the Cold War to strike at

23:00.676 --> 23:10.287
the Russians was overplayed. So there was a 
popular view widely spread all over the country

23:10.347 --> 23:29.670
that in case there is armed conflict between the 
people and the Russians in any of the satellite

23:10.347 --> 23:29.670
countries, there would be American 
intervention. This has been so widely popular,

23:30.376 --> 23:54.392
held even by the leaders, even by Imre Nagy, the 
prime minister, that when the Russians on

23:30.376 --> 23:54.392
November the 4th have started their second major 
offensive against the revolution and have

23:30.376 --> 23:54.392
completely run over Hungary, the last messages to 
the UN included appeals on paratroopers. Now I

24:03.177 --> 24:07.102
wonder what kind of paratroopers they would be 
would have expected. Of course Imre Nagy was

24:07.783 --> 24:18.237
talking to the UN not to the US, but in the minds of 
everybody else we were actually waiting for

24:19.027 --> 24:24.815
paratroopers who actually helped from heaven, 
actually from the sky, to be dropped over us. I did

24:25.597 --> 24:36.192
not believe in it personally, but a lot of people 
thought that American intervention was the only

24:25.597 --> 24:36.192
answer, the only logical answer to expect. And I am 
sure that a lot of people in this country thought

24:36.212 --> 24:45.085
that an American intervention was in order. So the 
disappointment was not only ours or that of my

24:45.790 --> 25:03.833
contemporaries at the time, but a lot of people 
here thought that letting down the Hungarian

24:45.790 --> 25:03.833
Revolution was the wrong decision by Eisenhower. 
In my opinion, there was no chance for

25:04.302 --> 25:17.801
intervention for America, and sad as it appears to 
be, I

25:04.302 --> 25:17.801
don't think I was terribly surprised. 
Frustrated, yes, but surprised, no. So, do you

25:21.386 --> 25:25.973
believe the US, through Radio Free Europe, helped 
to inspire the revolution? The US, by the Cold War

25:26.373 --> 25:33.263
alone, has certainly maintained the impression 
in Hungary that we had powerful allies in our

25:33.749 --> 25:46.028
struggle against the Soviet, allies that were 
ready to fight in case that was necessary. I don't

25:46.990 --> 26:00.651
think that the Hungarian public was sufficiently 
educated, and Free Europe didn't do the

25:46.990 --> 26:00.651
education, in the power play

26:01.475 --> 26:04.459
that has just started called coexistence. The 
word coexistence was just coined in the year in

26:04.779 --> 26:13.050
which the Hungarian Revolution took place. Sadly 
enough, this

26:13.070 --> 26:31.093
is possibly not very well known in this country 
anymore, in 1955, less than a year earlier than the

26:13.070 --> 26:31.093
Hungarian Revolution, the Austrian state was 
established. That was the only time since Second

26:36.848 --> 26:48.164
World War that the Russians have ever stepped 
back, namely pulled out from a country. Austria

26:48.184 --> 26:54.313
came about by

26:56.487 --> 27:18.023
I think an agreement packed between the four 
powers to withdraw troops from Austria and

26:56.487 --> 27:18.023
establish a neutral state and the Russians who 
occupied one-fourth of Austria have also agreed

26:56.487 --> 27:18.023
to draw to pull back now that in that year the the 
Western powers really made the decision of

27:18.391 --> 27:46.930
sealing the gains, the territorial gains of the 
Soviet after World War II, and our fate was also

27:18.391 --> 27:46.930
sealed, except we were not told about that, that 
with the establishment of the Austrian state, and

27:18.391 --> 27:46.930
blocking the entrance with the neutral state to 
the West, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland

27:18.391 --> 27:46.930
were finally and definitely given over to the 
interest sphere of the Soviet. And that has

27:56.045 --> 28:00.230
happened a year before the Hungarian Revolution. 
Again, my parents, who probably were a little

28:00.851 --> 28:09.762
better educated than the average, were terribly 
aware of what the establishment of Austria has

28:10.417 --> 28:15.526
meant. When that was celebrated in Radio Vienna by 
the, in the opera of Vienna, There was a great

28:25.992 --> 28:29.498
celebration and it was transmitted by radio. My 
parents literally wept while listening to it on

28:30.079 --> 28:33.845
radio. They knew that Austria has come about and 
Hungary got lost in that, in that, on that day. So

28:42.258 --> 28:49.249
we, we were not kidding ourselves, but Free Europe 
did not

28:50.849 --> 28:58.279
educate the public, and probably for good 
purpose, about this switch in Western policy. So,

28:59.661 --> 29:01.884
that's what I think about it. During the fighting 
itself, did you ever hear rumors that the U.S. was

29:02.525 --> 29:07.131
on the way? And, I mean, people, it was said they 
were running through the streets yelling that,

29:07.192 --> 29:11.878
you know, No, no, no, there were rumors about 
readiness of certain volunteer groups in Austria

29:12.297 --> 29:30.534
and in Germany, and that was, those rumors were 
actually well supported by facts. There were

29:30.554 --> 29:41.865
private groups ready to come, and of course the 
major problem would have been

29:43.263 --> 29:49.010
to cross any one of the neutral or communist 
countries. Hungary was not contiguous with any

29:49.130 --> 29:55.237
member of NATO. But Hungary is contiguous as the 
result of Second World War with the Soviet Union.

30:01.105 --> 30:07.252
The Soviets have established the borders in such a 
way that they have direct access to all the

30:01.105 --> 30:07.252
satellite countries. They don't have to cross 
another country in order to reach Romania,

30:10.988 --> 30:15.395
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, or even 
Bulgaria. And so it was very questionable how they

30:16.657 --> 30:22.607
would get through anybody. There were rumors, 
however, if I'm not mistaken, that Eisenhower

30:23.168 --> 30:30.660
decided to come himself to Budapest. Whether or 
not that rumor had anything behind it. factual, I

30:36.233 --> 30:39.498
don't know, but of course Eisenhower didn't come. 
The person who came was, and these are very famous

30:39.859 --> 30:58.208
people, the person who came was Brezhnev, who at 
the time was nobody, and ominously enough, the

30:39.859 --> 30:58.208
Hungarian ambassador, actually the Russian 
ambassador to Hungary at the time was
