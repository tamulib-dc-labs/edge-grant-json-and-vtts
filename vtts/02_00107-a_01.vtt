WEBVTT

00:04.469 --> 00:05.631
and see that it's working.

00:06.271 --> 00:15.343
This is August 16, sitting in the quiet front room, 405 Timber in College Station with Jim Hennigan.

00:16.445 --> 00:18.347
And Jim, use your mic now.

00:18.668 --> 00:19.008
Okay.

00:20.350 --> 00:21.111
What do you want to say?

00:21.131 --> 00:22.273
Or you just want to use it?

00:22.693 --> 00:23.334
Is it good enough?

00:25.256 --> 00:26.058
I don't know about this.

00:26.098 --> 00:29.362
We did this in front of Jeanette's dad, and he panicked.

00:29.642 --> 00:30.744
Boy, he just froze.

00:31.805 --> 00:33.227
All right, Jim, let's see.

00:33.950 --> 00:47.071
for someone who might not know you, who might use this materials in years in the future, give a brief summary of your experience growing up and so forth before you came to A&M, where and so forth.

00:47.091 --> 00:50.697
Well, we were born in Houston, grew up in Pasadena, Texas.

00:52.861 --> 00:54.203
During that time,

00:54.790 --> 00:56.672
I had, you know, enjoyed school.

00:56.872 --> 00:59.555
Became a, I was a very young Eagle Scout.

01:00.736 --> 01:07.662
And Bill Lay, our former admissions officer, was my den chief when I was in the Cubs.

01:08.303 --> 01:14.249
But I played in the band and really enjoyed school.

01:14.469 --> 01:16.431
I worked from the third grade on.

01:16.511 --> 01:19.534
In third grade I worked sweeping the school and then carried the paper out.

01:20.374 --> 01:21.996
So it was pretty normal.

01:22.482 --> 01:23.824
All right.

01:23.844 --> 01:26.887
Why did you attend A&M instead of some other place, sir?

01:26.907 --> 01:27.148
Yeah.

01:27.608 --> 01:28.389
Well, you asked me that.

01:28.429 --> 01:32.214
I had an opportunity to go to A&M or Rice.

01:33.135 --> 01:36.980
And I visited one weekend.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.887
I came up to A&M in 1949 and visited again with Bill Lay out on the annex and the tar paper shacks.

01:43.542 --> 01:52.180
but was also offered a $250 opportunity award scholarship to come to A&M, and without that, I couldn't have made it.

01:53.122 --> 01:55.648
But I came, so I made a decision.

01:55.688 --> 02:01.500
Rice was too scientific, I thought, and A&M was more applied, so I feel it's turned out about that way.

02:01.868 --> 02:05.595
Now you didn't have any family that had come to A&M?

02:05.615 --> 02:09.122
No, none of my family had been to—I was kind of the first generation.

02:09.904 --> 02:13.892
Dad finished the fourth grade, but he was real sharp.

02:13.912 --> 02:19.162
He was an engineering assistant, but he finished the fourth grade and then learned it all himself from then on.

02:20.505 --> 02:24.012
When you came up here to enroll, how did you get here?

02:26.557 --> 02:35.445
The folks brought me and brought me over to the band dorm and over by the theater.

02:35.985 --> 02:40.109
Right across the street from the old theater was the band dorm, freshman band dorm in those days.

02:40.169 --> 02:48.376
And I remember they drove up and we set my footlocker out on the curb and they said, we'll see you.

02:48.957 --> 02:52.720
And the guy, the senior there says, we'll take care of it.

02:52.740 --> 02:56.023
And they did, but I thought that was funny.

02:56.003 --> 02:59.990
That footlocker, was that one you bought there?

03:00.171 --> 03:02.855
No, that was one—bought it years ago.

03:02.875 --> 03:07.343
You just got a footlocker in an academy or somebody had footlockers we bought.

03:07.364 --> 03:09.087
And that's where you—everything was in that.

03:10.469 --> 03:11.872
All right.

03:11.892 --> 03:18.163
What did you—do you remember what you brought in terms of gear and paraphernalia and other stuff?

03:18.363 --> 03:19.084
Gosh, no.

03:19.625 --> 03:24.172
We had a list, as always, like six towels, two sheets, and all that.

03:25.234 --> 03:30.703
But I do remember they sent our clothes home, as I remember they sent our civilian clothes home once we got our uniform.

03:30.723 --> 03:35.170
Did you bring anything like a typewriter, a radio?

03:36.152 --> 03:37.454
No, didn't have any of that.

03:37.474 --> 03:41.080
Bought a radio in the senior year, a typewriter,

03:44.114 --> 03:50.568
I think I did get one from home that was antique and it wouldn't work worth it too, but yeah.

03:50.588 --> 03:51.489
All right.

03:51.509 --> 03:57.302
What was your, well, describe your impression of the campus.

03:57.342 --> 03:59.406
What did the campus look like when you arrived?

04:00.500 --> 04:04.165
Fear, I think was my expression.

04:04.185 --> 04:10.873
After, you know, I got in, after I got in my room and everything, I began to see what it was about.

04:13.297 --> 04:19.224
But it was like a, like a great experience that was coming up, but looking forward to it, a great experience.

04:19.304 --> 04:23.950
And the campus was clean and well taken care of even in those days.

04:24.110 --> 04:27.655
And I just thought it would be a great time, great experience.

04:27.736 --> 04:31.404
And to what dorm and outfit were you assigned?

04:31.424 --> 04:33.288
I was assigned to the freshman band.

04:34.030 --> 04:39.622
I believe that was in, gee, I'm sorry, I don't remember.

04:39.682 --> 04:43.129
I know it's right across from the, from the,

04:43.295 --> 04:45.597
movie theater now, but that's a freshman band.

04:45.617 --> 04:47.338
So I was there the first year I was here.

04:47.879 --> 04:54.765
In 50, the freshman lived over on the Sabisa side of the campus, all freshmen.

04:54.785 --> 04:57.587
So we had freshmen and we did the marching and led the.

04:57.707 --> 05:03.492
About how many were in the freshman band?

05:03.692 --> 05:06.795
I'd say 120, including Clayton Williams.

05:07.636 --> 05:09.738
He was in there, but.

05:10.178 --> 05:12.660
Any other notable Texas names in that group?

05:13.687 --> 05:15.450
Well, Tom Barron just died.

05:16.271 --> 05:21.459
Not in that group, but when I was in the, in the Corps a little later, H.P.

05:21.519 --> 05:24.544
Zachary lived down the hall and he was, you know.

05:24.564 --> 05:30.673
Did you know, did you know who Clady was as a freshman?

05:30.713 --> 05:32.876
He lived right across the hall and over one, so.

05:33.197 --> 05:34.839
Describe him.

05:34.859 --> 05:40.588
Oh boy, he was, he was an interesting, he's a real,

05:40.754 --> 05:46.883
You know, it was kind of his first chance to go to college, and he was a real, real country boy from West Texas.

05:47.684 --> 05:57.880
And he was always real funny and joking, and he slept a lot, but he was just a, you know, normal guy.

05:58.120 --> 06:01.265
Was he that outgoing person then that he is now?

06:01.285 --> 06:05.231
Yeah, and yeah, he was, in kind of a basic way.

06:05.271 --> 06:09.377
I mean, he would laugh and seem to enjoy life quite a bit.

06:10.387 --> 06:11.428
Let's see.

06:13.791 --> 06:17.936
As a freshman, you were assigned to the freshman band.

06:18.477 --> 06:26.747
Describe the typical routine of a day of classes in the freshman band.

06:26.807 --> 06:27.889
What time did you get up?

06:27.989 --> 06:29.591
What did you all do during the day?

06:29.671 --> 06:30.832
And what time did the day end?

06:31.873 --> 06:33.956
Well, the day ended about 2 in the morning.

06:33.996 --> 06:34.757
I remember that.

06:35.716 --> 06:39.984
and we would sleep about four or five hours, get about 6.30 as I remember.

06:40.064 --> 06:45.253
The Whistlejog had to get up a little earlier at 6 or something like that.

06:45.273 --> 06:50.162
And so we farmed up and then we marched, of course, to Subison.

06:51.645 --> 06:59.158
And as soon as that was over, we had to come back, run back to the dorm basically and then break for class and go to class.

06:59.223 --> 07:02.947
Did you play your instruments in that march?

07:03.167 --> 07:03.948
Not every morning.

07:04.248 --> 07:09.054
No, it seemed like it was just, no, not every morning.

07:09.074 --> 07:10.255
All right, so you went to class.

07:10.415 --> 07:12.397
Did everybody have an 8 o'clock?

07:12.417 --> 07:16.141
Everybody had an 8 o'clock and everybody had a 12 o'clock on Saturday, it seemed like.

07:16.201 --> 07:18.644
I think, yeah, we went to 12 on Saturday.

07:19.305 --> 07:24.771
So it was a full, not everybody, but classes were held then, yeah.

07:24.791 --> 07:26.292
It was a full day.

07:26.573 --> 07:27.113
What about after?

07:27.133 --> 07:28.875
Taking 20 hours about.

07:29.243 --> 07:33.007
in the band and other activities so.

07:33.027 --> 07:35.030
Did you have a major already selected?

07:36.892 --> 07:37.472
Yes I did.

07:37.512 --> 07:46.643
I came in mechanical engineering and I busted ME 213 and I figured if I busted that then that was certainly the wrong major for me.

07:47.003 --> 07:56.314
So I then went to industrial engineering which was in those days had just been, name had just been changed from management engineering to industrial.

07:57.357 --> 07:59.320
Yeah, I still remember that course.

07:59.340 --> 08:00.461
Now is that your freshman year?

08:01.122 --> 08:02.244
Yes, that's my freshman year.

08:02.264 --> 08:03.005
200 course?

08:04.647 --> 08:06.069
No, I'm sorry, I don't think.

08:06.249 --> 08:07.751
No, that must have been my sophomore year.

08:08.191 --> 08:12.137
Yeah, so I was a freshman in ME and then a sophomore year.

08:12.637 --> 08:17.924
All right, as a freshman, what did you fish do in the afternoons?

08:18.645 --> 08:21.690
Did you have any free time during the week?

08:23.392 --> 08:25.735
You know, I don't remember much free time.

08:25.775 --> 08:27.297
It was crunch, crunch.

08:27.918 --> 08:29.940
And I think we were taking about 20 hours.

08:31.122 --> 08:38.370
And the other things, we didn't have much money to go, you know, to do much.

08:38.390 --> 08:41.274
So we kind of made our own activities.

08:41.334 --> 08:48.061
And one, the seniors used to bowl, you know, used to store Coke bottles in the end of the hall.

08:48.542 --> 08:51.546
And the seniors would come in and throw things into the Coke bottles at night.

08:51.566 --> 08:56.271
And they would just be broken all over the place.

08:56.892 --> 09:01.080
A couple of activities we did is we threw water on some people and things like that.

09:02.022 --> 09:03.545
Were any of those organized?

09:04.306 --> 09:12.241
Well, when I was a freshman, the second week here, we got, one guy was a little smart aleck, so 10 of us decided to throw water on him.

09:12.261 --> 09:16.369
So we filled our buckets full of water, and that night we heard that's what you do at A&M.

09:16.822 --> 09:21.169
but we didn't realize you only throw one bucket and then put a little board over the door.

09:21.951 --> 09:34.071
So ten of us threw buckets and we couldn't get the door shut and he came out and slipped and broke his head man just blood all over the floor so we had to carry him over to the to the

09:35.553 --> 09:39.838
to the hospital and another guy ran through some broken coke bottles and we had to carry him over.

09:39.858 --> 09:40.820
So we had two guys.

09:41.320 --> 09:45.886
So therefore we got in trouble and I was campus then for two months by General Boatner.

09:46.707 --> 09:53.275
Campus meaning every hour on the weekend you had to be in uniform and sign in for a couple months.

09:53.295 --> 09:57.921
Did that also mean you could not leave the campus during that hour?

09:58.001 --> 09:58.262
Right.

09:58.462 --> 10:00.244
You had to stay on campus.

10:00.410 --> 10:01.351
Not that I remember.

10:01.411 --> 10:03.935
Well, I'm not sure, but you had to be there on the hour.

10:04.375 --> 10:06.238
That was funny.

10:06.338 --> 10:12.285
Now, this person that y'all drunk the water on, was he a sophomore?

10:12.306 --> 10:13.147
No, he was a freshman.

10:13.167 --> 10:20.676
He had ROTC in Dallas, and he was a big, you know, really going to show us all how to do it, and we all got, said, well, that's not the way it works.

10:21.638 --> 10:22.859
Did he ever retaliate?

10:24.481 --> 10:24.682
No, no.

10:24.842 --> 10:27.185
He didn't pay y'all back for that?

10:27.205 --> 10:30.349
Well, that's about ten to one.

10:30.953 --> 10:35.057
Well, let's define the word hazing however you want to.

10:36.379 --> 10:41.645
Can you give any examples of freshmen being hazed your first year?

10:43.326 --> 10:43.467
Yeah.

10:44.648 --> 10:54.058
Well, hazing's hard to identify when you got, because as you know, the Japanese aircraft carrier pilots

10:54.477 --> 10:59.925
the instructors carried a board and when they made a bad landing they gave them, you know, whacked them pretty good.

11:05.733 --> 11:06.354
Let's see, what?

11:07.476 --> 11:09.920
Did y'all ever get whacked?

11:09.940 --> 11:10.621
Yeah, let's see.

11:10.981 --> 11:19.534
Well, yeah, now as a freshman we didn't get paddled, but at the end of the freshman year you had what's called get your handle beat off.

11:20.135 --> 11:21.797
So you lose the term freshman.

11:21.837 --> 11:23.860
So some guys came by three,

11:24.397 --> 11:29.825
juniors in the band came over to the freshman area looking for freshmen, so somehow I got involved.

11:29.865 --> 11:35.793
So we went out in the country here, and I got nine licks with a one-by-four about four feet long.

11:36.294 --> 11:37.997
That's called beating your handle off.

11:38.017 --> 11:39.679
One for each letter in your name?

11:39.759 --> 11:43.565
No, no, just three licks from each guy.

11:44.105 --> 11:44.806
Oh, oh, oh.

11:44.826 --> 11:46.308
So for a total of nine.

11:46.328 --> 11:47.550
Everybody got met.

11:47.710 --> 11:50.234
Yeah, those that were exposed to that.

11:50.815 --> 11:52.277
So I went home after that.

11:53.523 --> 11:56.733
And mom about came, she said, why are you walking funny?

11:57.335 --> 12:00.666
She about came apart and dad saw it and he just laughed.

12:00.686 --> 12:04.478
And when I had circles, I had a blue circle.

12:05.065 --> 12:09.169
blue black and then I had a purple and then I had a yellow.

12:09.189 --> 12:12.412
So it was really kind of terrible looking, two circles on your back.

12:13.593 --> 12:16.656
So that was not fun at all in the freshman year.

12:16.676 --> 12:20.199
Now did you bare your bottom for those or did you wear them?

12:20.699 --> 12:24.383
No, no you just wear your, you just kind of stand up straight.

12:24.663 --> 12:25.324
Through your trousers.

12:25.344 --> 12:26.425
You bet, boy.

12:27.386 --> 12:32.170
And when we were a junior that guy hit my roommate three times and

12:32.150 --> 12:47.847
The third time he hit him low so Sid called a lick on him and came around and hit him right in the middle of the back accidentally but he didn't paddle Sid anymore after that.

12:48.388 --> 12:56.757
Let's see, other hazing or howard that you remember from your freshman year.

12:57.479 --> 13:00.604
Well, you know, hazing is kind of interesting.

13:00.724 --> 13:08.577
I have a case here I thought was interesting where I'd been here about three weeks, and the senior told me to crawl under the table.

13:08.597 --> 13:15.128
He gave me a bowl of mustard and said, crawl under the tables, and I did, and paint the guy's boots with mustard.

13:15.148 --> 13:16.450
I went under there and did that.

13:17.071 --> 13:25.793
and got back, and we sat there, and we were, so we sat a little longer than normal, and when he got up, the blood curdling scream, everybody enjoyed that.

13:26.154 --> 13:28.901
He looked down at his boots, and they were all yellow as buster.

13:29.543 --> 13:30.545
Boy, was he ticked.

13:30.565 --> 13:32.430
So they were not aware that you had done that?

13:32.562 --> 13:34.664
Well, I'd been ordered by the senior over here.

13:35.105 --> 13:38.208
And I don't know how, because I crawled right down their legs.

13:38.248 --> 13:44.375
They must, you know, the other people at the table must have been aware.

13:45.396 --> 13:50.501
But that was the first thing, Haskell, that I, it made a difference.

13:50.561 --> 13:52.223
Here I did some first order.

13:52.824 --> 13:53.264
I did it.

13:54.225 --> 13:59.411
And being a little guy from high school, you know, timid, this really made a difference.

13:59.431 --> 14:01.253
I remember that.

14:01.233 --> 14:02.557
Yeah, it made a real difference.

14:02.577 --> 14:08.394
Did that, with upperclassmen, were you aware that that kind of got you an acceptance to them?

14:10.259 --> 14:14.331
Were you part of the group?

14:16.876 --> 14:19.640
Yeah, I guess so, mm-hmm, I guess so.

14:19.660 --> 14:21.943
What about your fish old lady?

14:21.963 --> 14:23.785
Did you have a special freshman roommate?

14:23.805 --> 14:26.850
Yeah, the guy from high school, Sidney Fulgin.

14:27.671 --> 14:32.938
He finished, he flew about 30 years in the Air Force and he finished as a colonel.

14:34.640 --> 14:38.546
F-U-L-G-H-A-M, from Pasadena, Texas, yeah.

14:39.367 --> 14:43.913
And he's retired over in, over near Austin.

14:44.990 --> 15:04.638
But I tell you one thing, when I, after I'd thrown water, thrown, after we'd gotten campus, well, after I'd gotten campus, the guys decided one night to go steal the Baylor Cubs.

15:04.658 --> 15:14.912
Oh, they'll call me.

15:15.044 --> 15:20.257
Anyway, so they decided to go steal the Baylor Bears.

15:20.959 --> 15:24.107
And I couldn't go because I was camping, see.

15:24.127 --> 15:25.611
And they went over there in a coop.

15:26.148 --> 15:29.432
guy named Baylor, B-O-E-H-L-E-R, I remember.

15:29.952 --> 15:45.891
It was his car and the Bears, they went on and stole the two Bears and they just tore that car up, put him in the back and then gave, didn't know what to do so gave him the loophole and he called the highway patrol and said, I don't know how I got here but there seemed to be two Bears tied behind my store.

15:46.872 --> 15:47.512
That was funny.

15:49.094 --> 15:52.358
So, I don't know about

15:52.692 --> 16:00.841
Hazing was here from the beginning, but, you know, being real timid from high school, I had to, you know, you did all kind of things they'd haze you to do.

16:00.881 --> 16:04.926
Go do this and do that and it made a difference.

16:05.226 --> 16:16.759
Did you ever, do you remember anything during your freshman year that looking back you think was inappropriate in the way some freshmen were treated?

16:19.625 --> 16:20.607
No, I really don't.

16:20.968 --> 16:27.382
I enjoyed it and I felt like I had made a decision to be there and nobody got hurt.

16:28.605 --> 16:32.093
You know, you got fussed at all the time and had to stand against the wall and all that.

16:32.734 --> 16:35.220
But as a freshman, we were separating.

16:35.605 --> 16:44.097
And we didn't have quite the, quite the attention, you might say, that we got when we moved over to the band.

16:44.457 --> 16:46.520
So we actually had two years as a freshman.

16:46.580 --> 16:55.172
Freshman year, and then we moved over to the band, and we were sophomores, but they had never had us, never had us over there before.

16:55.652 --> 16:56.954
So that was our first year in the band.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.418
So we got two years of pretty good hazing.

16:59.438 --> 17:02.642
Did you, as a freshman,

17:02.622 --> 17:06.627
Did you march with the band at athletic events?

17:08.809 --> 17:09.570
I don't think so.

17:09.590 --> 17:10.992
I don't remember.

17:11.552 --> 17:13.394
I do remember we had our own freshman band.

17:13.414 --> 17:17.139
We had reviews and everything using that band.

17:17.499 --> 17:20.663
But you didn't march at football games?

17:20.683 --> 17:21.784
Well, you know, we must have.

17:22.264 --> 17:23.666
Yeah.

17:23.946 --> 17:24.988
I'm sorry, Haskell.

17:25.068 --> 17:26.449
What did you, what instrument?

17:26.469 --> 17:27.430
I played the clarinet.

17:27.851 --> 17:28.031
Clarinet.

17:28.051 --> 17:31.515
Not well, but I played it.

17:31.782 --> 17:33.604
Who was the band director in those days?

17:33.624 --> 17:34.245
Colonel Adams.

17:34.505 --> 17:35.787
Describe Colonel Adams.

17:37.008 --> 17:42.375
Well, you know, as a freshman, sophomore, you really didn't get to know him too well.

17:42.435 --> 17:44.818
I was in the band two years is what I'm leading up to.

17:45.419 --> 17:54.069
My grades got so bad that McQuillan gave me an option of staying in the band or staying in A&M, kind of.

17:54.089 --> 17:55.371
So I said, well, I'll take that.

17:55.431 --> 17:57.213
So he had me change outfits.

17:57.253 --> 18:00.557
But the band was real...

18:00.892 --> 18:02.855
Real wild, took up a lot of your time.

18:03.056 --> 18:11.309
I remember shining doorknobs as a sophomore till three in the morning before a major physics test at seven or eight.

18:11.390 --> 18:12.572
I just remember then.

18:13.874 --> 18:14.154
Anyway.

18:16.258 --> 18:20.605
As you look back during that freshman year, who were some

18:21.884 --> 18:26.512
instructors, faculty members, and or advisors that were important to you?

18:27.814 --> 18:32.942
Dean Ransdell, who was the head of the freshman division, he showed great interest in people.

18:35.226 --> 18:37.750
Crawford was the only

18:38.101 --> 18:42.550
The only prof that talked to me as a person when I was there.

18:44.294 --> 18:46.980
The old engineering prof who had a bad hand.

18:48.122 --> 18:55.097
This is one reason when I came back I said I was going to work with the kids because he's the only one that showed an interest as I remember.

18:55.077 --> 18:56.881
How did he show that interest?

18:56.901 --> 19:01.332
Well, he'd be willing to talk to you and come in and help if you need any problems.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.577
We'll work some problems.

19:05.141 --> 19:07.225
He just seemed to be a real fine fellow.

19:07.246 --> 19:08.749
What about Dean Ransel?

19:09.016 --> 19:11.080
Dean Ransdell was the dean.

19:11.101 --> 19:20.741
He administered the tests and placement things and he was an outstanding gentleman really.

19:20.762 --> 19:23.147
I got to know him much better when I came back.

19:23.728 --> 19:28.358
What about other instructors that were important to you that freshman year?

19:29.823 --> 19:36.894
Well, there was an instructor, I don't remember much about, made a poor grade on English test.

19:36.914 --> 19:44.625
And I went in and he called me and said, now why'd you make this, you know, this is a terrible grade.

19:44.645 --> 19:51.155
I said, well, I had things on my mind and what it was, my dad was an alcoholic for many years.

19:52.657 --> 19:59.087
And he said something that, of course, I remember ever since and that is that you can either be that way

19:59.455 --> 20:00.176
or another way.

20:01.157 --> 20:04.320
And ever since that, that's another little thing in life I now remember.

20:04.360 --> 20:07.303
You can either be that way or you can go the other way.

20:07.824 --> 20:09.786
All right, during that freshman year.

20:09.906 --> 20:10.446
Freshman year.

20:10.726 --> 20:13.449
You didn't have any wheels.

20:14.130 --> 20:18.114
No, no, there was only about 20 cars on campus as I remember.

20:18.134 --> 20:21.497
When you did go back home, how did you get there?

20:21.517 --> 20:28.905
We walked to, I walked to, to Eastgate, Texas.

20:29.594 --> 20:30.715
And we had a line there.

20:30.735 --> 20:41.247
We'd get out of class, and as you, as everybody's told, you put a suitcase there or your bag or a Coke bottle or whatever in line, and then the freshman would get out there and thumb.

20:42.028 --> 20:46.313
And if someone stopped, you'd ask him where you're going, Houston, and how many can you take?

20:46.393 --> 20:47.254
He said, take two.

20:48.115 --> 20:56.345
So we'd call the next two that were sitting under the tree, and the next two cases, whether they're freshmen or seniors, you've got to go.

20:57.246 --> 20:58.487
Yeah.

20:59.075 --> 21:03.319
Could you get somebody to take your bag out there for you early?

21:04.040 --> 21:04.840
Was that allowed?

21:05.421 --> 21:10.365
I don't remember, but I don't remember as a freshman, you know, certainly.

21:10.385 --> 21:20.394
The other thing I do remember we used to do on hitchhiking, the guy in the front seat always stayed awake with the driver, kind of keep their eye on what's going on.

21:21.115 --> 21:22.276
Other two guys could sleep.

21:22.757 --> 21:26.500
Did you ever have any bad experience Aggie hitchhiking?

21:26.817 --> 21:29.421
Not a, not a, not a bit.

21:29.721 --> 21:30.943
I've not heard of him yet.

21:30.963 --> 21:37.793
In fact, we had one guy went to a wedding in Minnesota, a guy from Pasadena, and he hitchhiked over the weekend.

21:39.195 --> 21:40.838
It just took him about three or four days.

21:40.918 --> 21:42.440
He went to Minnesota and came back.

21:43.121 --> 21:48.870
Now, if you wear the uniform in those days, you didn't, you, and pretty clean cuts.

21:48.930 --> 21:51.193
Not like today, you see the, the rule.

21:51.974 --> 21:54.358
But I think very few people had cars.

21:54.418 --> 21:55.980
We only had one car.

21:57.158 --> 22:00.864
and of course now I've got more than that.

22:01.305 --> 22:06.873
When you were coming back, where in the Houston area was the magic place?

22:06.994 --> 22:23.740
There was a line, as I remember, called the Aggie Line out on Washington, and everybody knew about where it was, and so some of the guys, their parents would take them back, or some of them did—a few of them might have had cars, but everybody knew where the Aggie Line was, and mother would

22:23.888 --> 22:25.370
drive me over there right now.

22:25.391 --> 22:27.194
About three times I took the trains.

22:27.254 --> 22:34.165
He'd drive me to the train station from Pasadena to train station downtown Houston.

22:34.786 --> 22:36.749
So I got to ride the train about three times.

22:36.769 --> 22:41.517
You said you had a $250 opportunity award scholarship.

22:41.537 --> 22:48.529
And my total expenses for the year covering everything for nine months was $900.

22:48.948 --> 22:54.535
So that was a little more than a fourth of your actual expenses.

22:54.555 --> 22:54.695
Yeah.

22:55.276 --> 23:00.382
And I worked, Dad always made me save a fourth of everything I ever earned for college.

23:00.402 --> 23:02.765
So I had about $800 at the time.

23:03.386 --> 23:10.996
Do you remember about how much money you had for spending money as we might have phrased it then?

23:11.316 --> 23:16.743
Yeah, I had about $2 a month maybe.

23:16.763 --> 23:16.863
Okay.

23:16.883 --> 23:18.465
And what did you spend at all?

23:18.563 --> 23:20.405
Sometimes I went to a movie.

23:20.605 --> 23:21.666
Most of the time I studied.

23:22.828 --> 23:24.109
I'd study on the weekend.

23:24.129 --> 23:32.278
We had a few dates and I spent some money there, but mother would bring, if we'd get a date for a big ball or something, she'd bring them up.

23:32.298 --> 23:37.844
Usually bring up two or three girls from Pasadena and they'd find a place at a prof's house or something, you know, this thing.

23:38.524 --> 23:41.888
As a freshman, do you remember any dating?

23:43.437 --> 23:45.960
or was that later years?

23:45.980 --> 23:50.585
Well, I came from A&M, pardon me, when I came from high school, I was really a weenie.

23:51.005 --> 23:56.151
I was really backward and very timid, you might say.

23:56.912 --> 23:59.295
But, yeah, I had some beautiful girls.

23:59.335 --> 24:05.462
They're very nice girls the mother brought up to different activities.

24:07.003 --> 24:09.506
And that's as a freshman, freshman ball, I remember.

24:09.626 --> 24:12.870
But, you know, no one to date here sort of thing.

24:12.850 --> 24:14.892
Now that was held in Cebisa?

24:16.193 --> 24:18.576
Yeah, most of them were held in Cebisa, as I remember.

24:19.697 --> 24:23.280
All right, now let's jump to the sophomore year.

24:23.381 --> 24:26.624
Do you remember what you did that summer after your freshman year?

24:28.265 --> 24:32.410
Yeah, I was fortunate enough to get a job at Sinclair in Pasadena.

24:33.130 --> 24:40.798
And what's funny, I look back at this and say, you know, you had shift work, so I went on one shift and then,

24:41.167 --> 24:48.778
Somehow the second shift relief wouldn't come so I had to work two shifts and just I worked two shifts most of the summer.

24:50.181 --> 25:03.040
I really don't know if the foreman or superintendent was an Aggie or not but I sure made a lot of money and could pay for my school so yet my relief never showed up so that was during the summer and worked three summers.

25:03.020 --> 25:06.646
The Opportunity Award, was that only your freshman year?

25:06.726 --> 25:08.348
No, it was four years.

25:10.251 --> 25:10.391
Mm-hmm.

25:10.411 --> 25:10.511
Okay.

25:10.532 --> 25:10.632
Yeah.

25:10.652 --> 25:18.644
And then we got, when we were in the second, the second, no, the third and fourth year, we got $30 a month that helped all that.

25:19.585 --> 25:23.451
So it was, it was hard to find.

25:23.692 --> 25:25.514
You're still in the band.

25:25.735 --> 25:31.103
Still in the first half, still in the band through football season, through the first semester.

25:31.285 --> 25:33.589
And where were y'all quartered then?

25:33.689 --> 25:36.634
We were quartered in dorm 12, where they are now.

25:37.075 --> 25:37.937
I believe they're in 12.

25:38.317 --> 25:38.578
Okay.

25:38.898 --> 25:39.720
Yeah, dorm 12.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.483
In the, quote, new dorm area.

25:43.026 --> 25:43.627
Right, right.

25:43.647 --> 25:45.751
All right.

25:46.612 --> 25:49.918
Was the routine over there much different than it had been?

25:50.050 --> 25:52.252
Well, remember we were freshmen the second time.

25:52.292 --> 25:54.134
We got harassed terribly over there.

25:55.276 --> 26:07.308
After we left the freshmen, we had juniors and seniors as our leaders and we went over there and you had the sophomores that were sophomores were now, no, freshmen last year were now sophomores.

26:07.328 --> 26:11.232
So anyway, it was two years of that as a sophomore.

26:11.252 --> 26:16.598
Did y'all make, did you make any memorable trips with the band that second year?

26:19.615 --> 26:21.477
Well, we made a couple court trips.

26:21.557 --> 26:23.278
I don't remember where to, of course.

26:24.840 --> 26:26.681
But I do remember going to Austin in one.

26:27.302 --> 26:32.787
They said everybody had to carry a sock with a piece of soap in it in case we got beat up.

26:32.887 --> 26:34.669
I mean, you know, that was going to be our club.

26:35.029 --> 26:37.011
So they just did all kind of things.

26:37.091 --> 26:41.195
Now, nothing, I presume there wasn't any problem.

26:41.215 --> 26:41.335
No.

26:41.355 --> 26:41.575
Oh, no.

26:41.835 --> 26:42.716
No, everything was.

26:43.697 --> 26:45.979
And did you all march down Congress Avenue?

26:46.199 --> 26:47.140
As I remember, yeah.

26:48.021 --> 26:48.161
Mm-hmm.

26:48.181 --> 26:49.082
Yeah, as I remember.

26:49.906 --> 26:52.151
Sophomore year.

26:52.171 --> 26:52.672
Let's see.

26:53.093 --> 27:01.651
All right, were there any, that sophomore year, any special teachers, advisors that became important to you?

27:02.694 --> 27:05.620
Any courses that kind of changed your path?

27:06.629 --> 27:07.631
No, no.

27:08.252 --> 27:10.996
It was just a terrible year.

27:11.977 --> 27:15.703
First year I made very high grades because it was a repeat of high school.

27:15.723 --> 27:18.267
And the second year was a little bit tougher.

27:18.307 --> 27:21.612
And then I had some problems at home, quite a few problems there.

27:21.652 --> 27:27.161
And that's why now I talk to the kids if they have bad grades.

27:27.241 --> 27:33.090
I've always called them in if they make less than 70 and say, now, what did I do wrong or what's your problem?

27:33.110 --> 27:35.033
And many times you learn these.

27:35.350 --> 27:41.482
I realized that—and you could more or less readjust their direction kind of—and I realized that.

27:41.803 --> 27:46.231
All right, so your second year, your grades weren't as good.

27:46.432 --> 27:46.672
Right.

27:46.692 --> 27:47.694
But you didn't flunk out.

27:48.315 --> 27:49.357
No, no.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.544
And did you think about transferring?

27:52.564 --> 27:55.249
I thought about everything, yes.

27:56.562 --> 27:59.570
I tell you, that was a pretty terrifying time of a kid's life.

28:00.412 --> 28:07.151
You feel your life's on the line when really it's just trying to learn another subject.

28:09.136 --> 28:12.124
So transferring, yeah.

28:12.948 --> 28:13.869
Well, I don't know though.

28:14.009 --> 28:15.931
I mean, I thought of all kind of things.

28:15.991 --> 28:16.872
How did I get out of this?

28:16.932 --> 28:18.473
But I was fixed.

28:18.553 --> 28:20.235
I didn't have enough money to do anything.

28:20.816 --> 28:22.177
And here I got the 250.

28:23.218 --> 28:29.204
And that plus the, oh, 700 or 800.

28:29.984 --> 28:31.025
I mean, it makes more than that.

28:31.065 --> 28:32.847
But anyway, I'd have some left over.

28:33.388 --> 28:37.351
So what I made in the summer of that 250 made a great difference.

28:37.371 --> 28:39.073
Now, I never really thought of quitting.

28:39.222 --> 28:44.011
Now I had some friends that came down with me at the same time and they quit within a few months.

28:44.793 --> 28:46.757
But no, I wanted to play the game.

28:47.077 --> 28:52.869
Okay, and so you shifted from mechanical to what we now call industrial.

28:54.091 --> 28:54.231
Yeah.

28:54.672 --> 29:00.724
And at the end of the sophomore year you felt pretty sure that that was the appropriate major.

29:02.577 --> 29:03.778
Other than calculus.

29:04.018 --> 29:07.462
Yeah, I felt it was calculus and thermal.

29:08.382 --> 29:09.724
But other than those, that was later.

29:10.264 --> 29:12.967
Other than that, I had trouble with that.

29:13.687 --> 29:16.010
I think I made it, but it was tough.

29:16.030 --> 29:17.331
And you dropped out of the band.

29:18.092 --> 29:30.323
Yeah, I dropped out of the band and moved to dorm two, in squadron two, and was there then, end of my sophomore year and through the

29:31.889 --> 29:34.634
Junior year yeah in squadron two.

29:35.094 --> 29:42.587
Was a transfer into that unit were you teased or?

29:42.947 --> 29:48.156
No it was real smooth I don't remember any problem any problem at all.

29:51.402 --> 29:54.707
Now let's see MSC was not yet

29:55.345 --> 29:57.347
See, it was finished in 50, wasn't it?

29:57.508 --> 30:01.993
So it was just, it was small, but it was, it was completed, yeah.

30:02.614 --> 30:05.357
But not yet with the big important.

30:05.377 --> 30:07.880
Oh, no, no.

30:07.900 --> 30:11.825
Dine Hall was a place for movies and lectures and so forth.

30:11.885 --> 30:12.886
And Joni James.

30:13.266 --> 30:13.947
Joni James.

30:13.967 --> 30:14.708
It was a concert.

30:15.489 --> 30:16.450
Who else would came?

30:18.512 --> 30:21.496
She was very, everybody remembered her pretty well.

30:21.636 --> 30:22.117
Oh, yes, yes.

30:22.137 --> 30:24.019
Because we were in the balcony, you see.

30:24.370 --> 30:32.062
And when she would lean over to sing to the first row, everybody in the balcony would about, oh, they just roared to the edge of the balcony.

30:32.102 --> 30:35.228
I don't know, they're just kind of interested in hearing her singing, I guess, you know.

30:35.268 --> 30:35.889
There you go.

30:36.009 --> 30:37.151
That was hilarious.

30:37.732 --> 30:41.097
Now, were there other famous performers you remember who came?

30:43.102 --> 30:44.523
Remember, I didn't have any money.

30:44.664 --> 30:46.085
I had zero money.

30:46.946 --> 30:50.950
And I'll never forget, I had 20 cents.

30:52.131 --> 30:55.694
We had two weeks until I had a bill of 30 bucks.

30:56.775 --> 31:02.041
And I went to the fair with some guys, and they each dropped $20 on the shell game.

31:03.202 --> 31:04.183
I had 20 cents.

31:05.284 --> 31:08.527
And that I remember well.

31:09.428 --> 31:12.771
But somehow, you know, we got enough to make it.

31:12.869 --> 31:14.812
Now this was the state fair?

31:14.892 --> 31:17.755
Well, it was Brian, no, Brian over here.

31:18.136 --> 31:26.227
We just went there one day and it used to be over, well, in old Brian, old fairgrounds here, but anyway.

31:27.749 --> 31:32.515
Let's see.

31:32.866 --> 31:36.993
I remember them tearing down again too when I came back as a prop.

31:37.073 --> 31:38.776
Boy, they beat that thing and beat it.

31:39.778 --> 31:45.487
Were there any, did you take part in any religious activities in that era?

31:46.649 --> 31:49.554
No, I went to church every Sunday.

31:49.574 --> 31:49.714
Where?

31:50.616 --> 31:54.342
First Baptist Church across the campus in Northgate.

31:55.704 --> 31:57.628
What led you to go there?

31:57.748 --> 31:59.110
Was that family background?

31:59.967 --> 32:01.291
Oh, you mean Baptist?

32:03.076 --> 32:04.841
Well, that's kind of my background.

32:04.941 --> 32:13.144
I mean, Dad was a Baptist, Mother was a Catholic, and so I just kind of chose the Baptist approach, conservative Baptist.

32:13.264 --> 32:14.247
Did anybody...
