WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:07.082
my master's degree, and then to get a PhD. And I had 
to validate all of these courses that I took in 1937

00:08.563 --> 00:16.871
and 38, 39.

00:21.114 --> 00:23.997
Professor Hunt was ag eco teacher. And I went to him 
and I said, Dr. Hunt, I need to validate your

00:24.918 --> 00:29.962
course. And he reached over and gave me a book. and 
said, take this. And I read that book for three

00:35.449 --> 00:38.212
hours. And there wasn't a thing in that book that I 
knew anything about. So I took it back to him. And I

00:46.019 --> 00:48.162
said, I didn't take this course. He said, oh, what 
course did you take? And I said, well, I took the

00:51.645 --> 00:54.568
course on cooperatives. He said, oh, yes, I 
remember. And he gave me a test on it. And I had had

00:59.332 --> 01:03.096
contact with one of the Grange field officers who 
went to Washington to lobby for the Granger. That

01:16.168 --> 01:19.633
was the name of an organization, wasn't it? 
Incidentally, he was from Granger. And he took me

01:24.680 --> 01:30.990
to eat dinner one day in Austin and ordered steak 
mignon. And that's the first time I ever saw one of

01:31.848 --> 01:36.553
them. But I kept in touch with him, and I spent my 
time doing my work, and I got acquainted with

01:36.573 --> 01:47.183
Pakistanis. With whom? Pakistanis, East 
Pakistan. Yes, sir. And I was very familiar with

01:52.849 --> 02:01.838
one student, and he got to A&M three months after 
the two months after the courses had started that

02:02.054 --> 02:25.834
meant in october something or other and i helped 
him catch up in genetics so we became friends and we

02:02.054 --> 02:25.834
were friends while he was there and the fact that i 
knew him as well as i did led me to want to go to where

02:26.455 --> 02:37.817
he was, and I did in 1955, and spent nearly two years 
in Pakistan before I came back to start teaching

02:26.455 --> 02:37.817
genetics in 57. All right, now, did you finish your 
PhD? Right. In what? Animal breeding. Animal

02:47.536 --> 02:48.177
breeding. And where did you all live during those 
years in College Station? We lived in the barracks

02:52.260 --> 02:56.887
that they had moved in. Describe life for a veteran 
in those barracks. Well, we had two bedrooms and

03:00.853 --> 03:14.012
four kids, and we got a bed rail, and we put bunk beds 
in one room, for our four children, and my wife and I

03:14.313 --> 03:18.058
slept in the other. And she got a job and worked 
while I was there. After we'd been there, I didn't

03:24.606 --> 03:31.274
get enough on my GI to feed the family. Now these 
were, you said the barracks, this was over at

03:32.575 --> 03:35.639
College View? Right. Do you remember what the rent 
was? Because I don't know that. I don't know that.

03:43.827 --> 03:45.469
It wasn't very much. Somebody asked me one time, 
well, can you live with four kids in College View?

03:51.817 --> 03:55.842
And I said, well, you can if you needed to do it as 
best as I did.

03:59.987 --> 04:06.456
But after I'd been there for a while, we saw Qazi 
quite often. And he invited us to all of the

04:07.417 --> 04:11.522
Pakistani functions.

04:18.269 --> 04:24.560
He got a telegram one day and came to our house at 
noon to eat lunch with us. And when we sat down to the

04:24.580 --> 04:28.387
table, he handed me a telegram. And this telegram 
said, your wife will arrive in New York City at such

04:29.268 --> 04:41.830
and such a time and said, attend her arrival. And 
that time specified was four hours before he

04:42.586 --> 04:48.472
handed me that telegram. Well, obviously he 
couldn't go to New York to meet her, so I suggested

04:50.154 --> 04:58.823
that Traveler's Aid would help us. And I called the 
Traveler's Aid and asked them if they would take

04:58.843 --> 05:08.053
care of his wife. And he talked to his wife, and all 
he could hear was boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo. And so we

05:16.158 --> 05:29.458
had to go and get a money order to send to Traveler's 
Aid to pay her transportation from New York to

05:16.158 --> 05:29.458
Houston. And by the time we got those arrangements 
made and took off for Houston, we got to Houston at

05:30.319 --> 05:38.091
the same time his wife got to Houston. And we took 
care of him for 18 months or more, his wife and

05:38.712 --> 05:46.723
daughter. His daughter went to school in College 
Station. Now, the campus in those days was

05:49.006 --> 05:52.450
crowded, wasn't it? Not very compared with what it 
is now. No, but compared with what it had been

05:57.096 --> 06:00.080
before World War II. You bet. And where did you all 
do your shopping, and where did the kids play?

06:07.971 --> 06:08.331
Well... the kids played with the other kids in the 
project house. But our kids were all of school age

06:14.094 --> 06:18.440
except one. And we had to have a neighbor to babysit 
the youngest one while the rest of them went to

06:19.842 --> 06:30.276
school and both of us went to work. And where'd 
y'all shop? Mostly at a big grocery store right at

06:40.357 --> 06:46.225
the bend of the road up there in Bryan. Oh, Wine 
Gardens. Wine Gardens. And we sometimes shopped

06:48.668 --> 06:51.652
at the store. O'ers? Yeah. And were you all 
churchgoers in that era? Yes, sir. Where

06:59.241 --> 07:01.104
described the church? We went to A&M, to the church 
that was there next to the campus. Church Christ?

07:07.011 --> 07:07.512
Yes, sir. Who were the key teachers and advisors 
that helped you as a graduate student? Bob Schrode

07:16.172 --> 07:18.174
comes to mind first. Who? Bob Schrode. S-C-H-R-O? 
No, S-H-R-O-D-E. S-H-R-O. He was the chairman of

07:24.740 --> 07:26.462
my committee. Okay. Mr. Godby was on my committee. 
And whenever they started setting up my program,

07:31.086 --> 07:37.853
he sat there just like I, he didn't know what was 
going on. And finally he said, look here, he said,

07:38.474 --> 07:45.922
you people have set up for a Ph.D. so many hours. 
Don't you think that's ridiculous? Let's cut that

07:47.884 --> 07:49.546
back down. And he eliminated 40 hours that they 
thought I ought to have to have a Ph.D. Now then,

07:50.386 --> 08:02.859
language, two languages are required. And There 
was a man that came over from Austin to teach

08:05.947 --> 08:10.711
German. And I enrolled in this course and got my 
credit. And somebody decided they weren't going

08:16.777 --> 08:20.060
to give him credit. And I went to Dr. Morgan and 
said, look here, and told him what happened. And he

08:26.786 --> 08:34.873
said, that is acceptable, and I'll write the dean 
that it is acceptable.

08:35.410 --> 08:40.735
When I started Spanish, I got a Spanish book on 
agriculture. And on the first page, I had to look up

08:41.776 --> 08:44.899
so many words. And then on the second page, I had to 
look up so many words. And when I got to page 25, I

08:49.103 --> 08:58.892
took the written test on Spanish and passed that 
Spanish. But it didn't take long if you didn't

08:58.912 --> 09:04.978
devote your time to anything but studying 
Spanish. to be able to read page 151, 52, so that I

09:06.325 --> 09:13.955
passed both of those that way. Was O.D. Butler a 
member of the department then? He was head of the

09:18.037 --> 09:20.199
Animal Science Department. All right. Did you 
ever have any association with him as a graduate

09:21.420 --> 09:24.443
student? Not particularly. All right. You 
finished your work then in 55? I finished

09:29.688 --> 09:34.732
it Christmas of 1954. 54. And then what did you do 
next? Well, A&M had sent a group of people to East

09:39.457 --> 09:46.103
Pakistan on September the 1st. H.E. Hampton of the 
agronomy department was the head of that group.

09:51.634 --> 10:01.346
But there had been a Pakistani over here who was 
head of the, he was director of education in East

09:51.634 --> 10:01.346
Pakistan. And he visited with me quite a bit 
because Qazi told him who I was. And so after I

10:09.256 --> 10:15.904
finished whatever I had to do, Then I was

10:17.217 --> 10:25.649
picked when somebody else didn't make the team. 
Somebody was turned down, and McElroy was the name

10:27.391 --> 10:33.119
of the man that was going. But they found out he had 
been in India, and they wouldn't have anybody that

10:33.159 --> 10:39.207
had been in India to come to Pakistan. So they put me 
on as a consultant. and assigned me to in East

10:43.238 --> 10:47.583
Pakistan. When we got there, we lived in a house 
with a man that was single and he had part of the

10:49.245 --> 11:00.218
building and we had part of the building and we 
didn't move to . We got there in January and it took

11:01.379 --> 11:12.132
me from January to April to get his house ready for 
us to move into. And I got very well acquainted with

11:12.854 --> 11:16.578
Nero Amin. He was at one time the high muckety muck 
in East Pakistan, but his party had been defeated

11:17.199 --> 11:28.711
in the last election. But he was a fantastic 
individual and owned the house that we were to rent

11:28.731 --> 11:36.700
in Myman Singh. Jane had an attack of 
appendicitis. We took her over about midnight to

11:43.077 --> 11:47.442
the doctor there. And the doctor said, well, she's 
got appendicitis. And said, I don't recommend the

11:52.807 --> 11:56.871
DACA hospital. You go to Mime and Sing. There's a 
nun running a hospital in Mime and Sing. So I put her

12:04.599 --> 12:06.922
on the train. And we got to Mime and Sing about 
midnight. went to the hospital and they bedded me

12:11.596 --> 12:17.785
down in one place and put Jane in another place. 
They started to get her out to go to surgery and she

12:17.825 --> 12:26.096
said, look, I'm not going to surgery until I see my 
husband. So they woke me up before Jane went for her

12:26.817 --> 12:35.850
operation and she never did go back to Miami, to 
DACA.

12:36.992 --> 12:40.877
I went back to DACA and got the kids and brought them 
to Miami City. And y'all were over in Pakistan how

12:41.212 --> 12:43.575
long? Well, we got there in January of 1954, I

12:44.056 --> 12:56.891
guess.

13:00.776 --> 13:02.579
We didn't stay quite two years. We lacked about 
three months of being two years. And the purpose of

13:06.764 --> 13:09.447
that project was to do what? we were advisors to the 
college that we were assigned to. And since my

13:16.476 --> 13:23.125
master's degree was in education, it was 
compatible for the place that I was to be assigned.

13:24.887 --> 13:37.243
And we got to Miami and Sing in April, and we left a 
year and from April to August. We left in August of

13:37.923 --> 13:39.906
the 57, no 56, to come home. And Mr. Godby had 
already offered me the job, but I couldn't get

13:47.665 --> 13:53.793
home. When I got home, it was already filled, and so 
I had to teach school one half year in Rosebud. I

14:02.823 --> 14:05.927
looked around College Station, couldn't find 
anything. enlarge my area until i got a job at

14:06.970 --> 14:33.552
rosebud all right and then after that half year you 
came back right i started teaching february 1957

14:06.970 --> 14:33.552
as a professor of genetics genetics right and i'm 
not going to ask pay any other time what was that

14:06.970 --> 14:33.552
beginning salary

14:06.970 --> 14:33.552
well now it wasn't as much as i got when i was in 
pakistan Mr. Godby started teaching at A&M when

14:35.050 --> 14:46.564
salaries were not very high, and he didn't 
consider, and I was underpaid the whole time that I

14:35.050 --> 14:46.564
was there. What were your duties? Teaching 
genetics. No, but what courses and how many and so

14:49.488 --> 14:52.352
on? Well, I taught only one course at A&M. What was 
that? Genetics 301. And that was animal? No, that

14:59.761 --> 15:00.762
was all. Right. Every bit and four. seven or eight 
years, we had one genetics course, and anybody

15:05.054 --> 15:15.424
that had genetics on their plan had to take 
genetics. And they finally hired a young man to

15:15.444 --> 15:21.329
help because my classes were so big. And I proposed 
to him that instead of having one class for him and

15:22.150 --> 15:31.939
two for me, that we team teach it. And so I gave him 
the last one-third of the course, which meant that

15:32.948 --> 15:52.307
I taught two-thirds of the class and then I was not, 
I was able to pursue other interests from then

15:32.948 --> 15:52.307
until the end of the school year. And I taught the 
course in the summer the same way. And normally how

15:56.511 --> 15:58.753
many were in your sections? How big were they? When 
I started teaching, there was an average of 19 in

16:00.151 --> 16:04.116
each class. And whenever they hired him, my 
classes had gotten to be where there was at least

16:04.836 --> 16:17.331
500 students each term. I taught over 11,000 
students at A&M. Some of them one time, some of them

16:20.795 --> 16:29.145
two times, one three times that I know of, one four 
times. What were your guidelines as a teacher? How

16:34.147 --> 16:38.211
did you approach that task? Well, to one extent or 
another, I taught the same course in genetics that

16:38.431 --> 16:50.525
I was taught when Dr. Humbert was head of the 
department. But in the meantime, when we got into

16:51.726 --> 16:59.875
the molecular genetics, I had not any background 
at all And I was thrilled when the young man came in

17:00.243 --> 17:05.448
and took over that third of the course. I had taught 
it, but I had to teach it not as something I knew, but

17:06.389 --> 17:16.918
as something that I had learned to follow the 
sequence. I don't think the course changed, but

17:16.998 --> 17:22.123
they had a better teacher that last third than I 
was. And they thought, including the animal

17:29.065 --> 17:34.111
husband, the department head, that he would come 
and show me up. And when they started talking about

17:35.593 --> 17:55.258
genetics and so forth, they asked him what he 
thought about McNeil, and he said, look, I just

17:35.593 --> 17:55.258
came from the fountainhead of genetics, and 
genetics, McNeil's a mess. best genetics teacher

17:55.610 --> 17:57.893
I've ever seen. He got his PhD at Illinois. I mean, 
at Cornell. He'd gotten his undergraduate in

18:03.821 --> 18:08.167
Illinois. What were the guidelines that you gave 
to your classes about how they should approach

18:10.250 --> 18:20.323
their work?

18:23.387 --> 18:23.828
Well, I don't exactly know. There's one or two 
things that I had more than one student to tell me

18:26.274 --> 18:39.789
that they didn't know how to study and how to get 
along until they took their genetics course. And I

18:41.030 --> 18:44.875
had one student by the name of Rick Perry. And after 
he got into politics, I made a point to get in touch

18:46.657 --> 18:52.363
with him. He and Kay Bailey Hutchinson came to Waco 
for a Lincoln Day dinner, and I stayed at the back.

19:00.686 --> 19:02.228
And he recognized me. I went to the back door as they 
were leaving, and he recognized me when he was as

19:02.248 --> 19:10.659
far away as that cabinet is over there. And I said, 
well, Rick, he said, Dr. McNeil said you taught

19:11.721 --> 19:20.713
genetics and said your course was the one that made 
me realize I didn't want to be a veterinarian. And

19:26.109 --> 19:29.253
I've had contact with Rick quite a lot since then. 
But you had, I'm sure you had some policies about

19:30.595 --> 19:36.524
people that cut class too often or went to sleep. 
How did you handle those things? Man missed class.

19:42.592 --> 19:47.719
I always started today's lesson with where I left 
off. Made a reference lesson. to the last lesson.

19:52.872 --> 20:02.606
And I had one student that came every other day, and 
when I was talking about reviewing for everybody,

19:52.872 --> 20:02.606
he was asking questions. And I called him in. I 
said, young man, I said, you ask questions when I

20:03.708 --> 20:08.976
don't want questions on that. I've already taught 
that. And I want you to know that his attendance was

20:11.540 --> 20:15.766
perfect the rest of the year. And I checked my 
students every day. And the first day of class I

20:23.119 --> 20:28.826
said, look, no shoes, no shirt, no class. I 
explained that at the beginning of the class. What

20:32.470 --> 20:33.912
about going to sleep in class?

20:36.996 --> 20:42.883
Well, I didn't have too many to go to sleep in class, 
I'll tell you that. One guy went to sleep and he had

20:42.944 --> 20:49.712
on glasses. dark glasses, and everybody got up and 
walked out, and he was still asleep. I told one of

20:59.027 --> 21:03.574
the students to wake him up, and the student said, 
you wake him up, you put him to sleep. But that weird

21:04.896 --> 21:06.899
sense of humor. But

21:09.002 --> 21:18.737
I used a lot of illustrations that were known to me. 
I don't know. Crossing over is something that's

21:23.990 --> 21:26.533
really important. And when you have crossing 
over, you have a break in one chromosome and a break

21:27.534 --> 21:35.142
in another, and these swap and heal back this way. 
And I told them about a cousin of mine whose hand was

21:36.103 --> 21:48.015
badly burned, and where there was burned space 
here and here, that they grew together just like

21:48.400 --> 21:57.471
the chromosomes

21:48.400 --> 21:57.471
grow together after their ends are broken. And 
they said, you have a lot of peculiar relatives one

21:57.491 --> 22:03.739
time. But,

22:04.960 --> 22:10.047
I don't know. Did you have, as a teacher, did you 
have anyone in your past that was kind of your

22:10.067 --> 22:15.994
model?

22:18.505 --> 22:19.726
Not really. I didn't admire Dr. Humbert too much.

22:28.675 --> 22:32.259
Mr. Godby was my god, I'll tell you that. And

22:34.041 --> 22:41.108
I guess I wrote my own. Who were your closest 
associates and buddies as faculty members? L.A.

22:48.863 --> 22:50.405
Maddox. His office was on the end of the building. 
M-A-D-D-U-X or O-X? O-X. He was an extension beef

22:56.754 --> 22:59.738
cattle man. I was in animal industries. And the 
toilet on that floor was through the same door that

23:03.303 --> 23:10.434
I went to my office. And when he'd come down to go to 
the toilet and it was already occupied, well then

23:11.275 --> 23:17.824
we'd talk together until he got an open space. But 
L.A. and I were real good friends. And when he told,

23:26.117 --> 23:44.706
when

23:26.117 --> 23:44.706
girls were admitted to the genetics class, he came 
by and said, well, there's one thing about it, says

23:26.117 --> 23:44.706
you're one of the few professors that have got to, 
don't have to change his language since girls are

23:26.117 --> 23:44.706
gonna be in your class. And that was true. You 
mentioned co-education. Do you remember any

23:50.274 --> 24:00.145
discussion by you and your friends before women 
were admitted seriously? Do you remember people

24:00.205 --> 24:04.210
talking about the possibility of women being 
admitted? I can't say that I really I mean my own

24:05.852 --> 24:14.642
opinion was my own and since I knew it was contrary 
to Rutter's I didn't communicate with many people

24:16.124 --> 24:18.647
about it. Let's talk about the leadership of A&M. 
The president when you joined the faculty was Dr.

24:22.671 --> 24:27.055
Morgan. That's right. What was your evaluation of 
him? I thought he was great. I don't know why he

24:33.242 --> 24:39.248
left, but I was sorry to see him go. Did you hear him 
very often speak or see him much? Not much contact

24:44.238 --> 24:46.040
with him. The only time I had contact with him was 
when I went to talk to him about the German course

24:46.140 --> 24:54.127
that had been taught at A&M for all these years. And 
they suddenly decided this won't do. Because as I

24:58.151 --> 25:07.260
understand, in hindsight, he favored 
co-education and making the Corps voluntary. And

25:09.182 --> 25:11.944
that that wasn't popular with the board at that 
point. I can understand that. I agree that that

25:14.275 --> 25:21.203
statement might very well be applicable. When

25:21.664 --> 25:31.376
Mr. Rutter was first appointed, do you remember 
any initial impression you all had of him? Well,

25:32.417 --> 25:41.768
he was not really highly regarded, and it was felt 
that he was a political appointee, and that

25:42.153 --> 25:51.466
he had to learn on the job if he did anything. Do you 
remember hearing any of his early speeches? Well,

25:56.213 --> 26:09.612
I've heard a few of them, and I was told that the best 
speech he ever made was at Project House Reunion,

25:56.213 --> 26:09.612
the first one we had in 69. And I don't know whether 
that, I mean, see, when I first started that work,

26:10.891 --> 26:28.888
I got in touch with a bunch of people, and whenever 
they had the reunion, I invited all of the old

26:10.891 --> 26:28.888
professors to come to the reunion and so forth. And 
it was former faculty members who left there

26:29.488 --> 26:39.177
saying that Rudder made the best speech I ever 
heard him make at the project house. And they told

26:40.169 --> 27:04.003
me in the Association of Former Students that 
Project House Reunion had more cohesion and so

26:40.169 --> 27:04.003
forth than any other group, including any core 
people, than did anybody on the campus. Why do you

27:04.023 --> 27:07.628
think the Project House graduates had that? 
because they had very little regard for A&M. They

27:11.629 --> 27:24.251
did not have the loyalty for A&M that the other 
students did because they'd been discriminated

27:11.629 --> 27:24.251
and had such a hard time getting through school. 
That's the reason. Of course, whenever they built

27:26.896 --> 27:33.227
the project houses over there and put students in 
them, they were more readily accepted than they

27:34.557 --> 27:44.450
had been when they were living in Navasota and 
Bryan and so forth. Incidentally, my mother was a

27:45.412 --> 27:52.141
project house housekeeper for four years at A&M. 
Please describe that.

27:56.807 --> 28:04.497
They had a McClendon County house and a good many 
boys not all but there was some boys from Moody and I

28:05.017 --> 28:31.227
just don't really know I think Russell probably 
invited her and daddy was out of a job so Russell

28:05.017 --> 28:31.227
asked her if she'd be a project house homemaker and 
she was she had the McLennan County house one year

28:05.017 --> 28:31.227
and it disbanded and then she had the Erath County 
House at 208 North Houston for three or four years.

28:38.069 --> 28:55.691
And they came over there from Huntsville and asked 
Russell about getting somebody to go to Sam

28:38.069 --> 28:55.691
Houston as the room, the matron for the band house 
at Huntsville, and she was there a couple of years.

28:56.332 --> 28:59.155
All right, during that four years, she was the... 
And what would be house mother? Is that what they

29:02.646 --> 29:05.690
were called for the project houses? Yes, sir. Do 
you remember what her compensation was? A dollar a

29:08.554 --> 29:11.077
student per month. But she had 31 students in a 
bigger house. And her duties were what? Well, her

29:20.891 --> 29:28.922
duty was to purchase, prepare, and set the tables. 
And they had somebody hired to do the dishwashing.

29:33.494 --> 29:40.005
Because I don't know of any project house anywhere 
that had the students doing the dishwashing. Did

29:40.025 --> 29:44.031
she have to keep the house, to clean the house, or 
anything like that? Each student was responsible

29:44.572 --> 29:46.836
for their own. They had a manager for each house. 
And it was his responsibility to do the buying and

29:50.030 --> 29:57.481
to make sure that the boys kept their room clean and 
so forth. How did she feel about the way the project

29:57.501 --> 30:03.831
house students respected her, treated her? Well, 
she was treated very well. The students respected

30:07.657 --> 30:14.828
and I'd say loved their house mother. I only knew of 
one case where the students were down on the house

30:19.004 --> 30:22.127
by then, and they moved out. Do you think she was 
proud to have that association? Yes, she was. I

30:27.834 --> 30:37.564
want you to know that when you're 55 years old, as my 
daddy was, there wasn't a terrific demand in those

30:27.834 --> 30:37.564
Depression days. And when she was living in 
Huntsville, my daddy worked from 7 until 7. every

30:48.923 --> 30:51.686
night at a filling station for a dollar. Now, she 
was the project house mother for when, what

30:53.208 --> 30:57.874
period? About the first year.

31:06.004 --> 31:09.509
She ended in about the first year of the World War 
II. Oh, so from about 36 to 41, something like that?

31:13.874 --> 31:17.539
No, then she was from 37, perhaps. 30, okay. So 
right after you graduated from A&M? It was maybe a

31:24.453 --> 31:30.041
year and a part of it, some, after I graduated. 
Okay.

31:34.206 --> 31:42.437
Describe some, when you were on the A&M faculty, 
describe some of your extracurricular

31:34.206 --> 31:42.437
activities with the students. Well, I was advisor 
to the Alpha Zeta, and I was advisor to 10 freshmen

31:43.244 --> 31:58.906
in agriculture, and I was advisor to the Young 
Republicans, and I was advisor to another club. I

31:59.266 --> 32:01.409
don't remember. Were you involved with the 
judging teams? No, not involved with them.

32:06.456 --> 32:08.359
Describe Alpha Zeta and its work. Well, Alpha Zeta 
is a national... Agricultural Students

32:13.062 --> 32:15.205
Organization. And the students

32:16.707 --> 32:26.362
select somebody from the School of Agriculture to 
be the advisor. And the first year you're just a

32:27.343 --> 32:38.800
common, the second year you become junior 
advisor, and the third year you become the head

32:27.343 --> 32:38.800
advisor. And so I spent three years as 
agricultural advisor for the agricultural Alpha

32:39.522 --> 32:47.035
Zeta.

32:50.160 --> 32:54.187
Do you remember some of those youngsters with 
pride? Oh, you bet. Among them was

32:55.930 --> 33:01.620
Fred McClure. Did he? He was in Alpha Z. Make 
believe that I didn't know Fred McClure. Describe

33:06.227 --> 33:07.729
him as a student. Well, I didn't have him as a 
student. No, describe him as a young man. He was a

33:11.875 --> 33:15.560
leader in whatever he took part in. What made him a 
leader? Well, one thing.

33:24.553 --> 33:33.205
He had the right kind of personality, and he was 
willing to take charge of something when

33:24.553 --> 33:33.205
something needed to be done. And he was president 
of the student body. Did he have a good speaking

33:36.766 --> 33:39.290
ability? Great. He made the speech at the Future 
Farmer Banquet the year before he came to A&M. And

33:47.642 --> 33:56.254
he did not have any contact with me as a teacher, but 
my only contact was through Republican politics

33:47.642 --> 33:56.254
in Alphazade. What about as a sense of humor? Did he 
have a sense of humor? I don't really remember

34:01.400 --> 34:03.703
that. Oh, it was superb. Great, great, great sense 
of humor. I had a student write on the bottom of his

34:09.390 --> 34:21.564
opinionaire page, you sure do have a weird 
S-I-N-C-E of humor. And I nearly fell out of my

34:23.046 --> 34:28.072
chair when I read that. That's good. That's a good 
Aggie story. Yeah, it is. That's a good Aggie

34:34.300 --> 34:35.622
story.

34:39.748 --> 34:46.478
When you were a faculty member, did the students 
ever try to play any pranks? Share some of those.

34:49.102 --> 34:50.905
Well, my class was strict one time. I guess I was the 
only professor that was strict. Was this during

34:57.054 --> 34:59.578
coeducational days? No. These were all male? 
Yeah.

35:06.256 --> 35:20.398
In the mechanical engineering building, 
petroleum engineering building, there was two

35:06.256 --> 35:20.398
doors in the room and there was a desk behind these 
two doors and the board was here.

35:24.424 --> 35:24.664
And

35:28.373 --> 35:39.791
After quiz A, two medical students came to me and 
said, we didn't study for quiz A and we both made

35:28.373 --> 35:39.791
poor grades on quiz A. And said, we want to take a 
makeup. And I said, look, if you've taken that

35:43.977 --> 35:52.410
quiz, that goes in the grade sheet. They said, 
look, we'll take you to Houston and take you to a

35:55.947 --> 36:10.721
ball game down there and give you plenty to drink 
and then we'll go out to this outstanding house out

35:55.947 --> 36:10.721
there, fish house out there, and we'll buy you the 
best dinner they've got. I said, I'm not

36:11.662 --> 36:13.244
interested. But it did make them known to me.

36:20.951 --> 36:24.975
And after

36:25.394 --> 36:32.562
a few, oh, maybe two months, I'd pass out exercise 
sheets. If they could work those exercise sheets

36:32.642 --> 36:46.097
that I prepared for them, and I'd place them on the 
front desk, and people would come by and pick them

36:32.642 --> 36:46.097
up and go home and work them, and that prepared them 
for the test. And one day, one of the students came

36:47.618 --> 36:55.367
to get his exercise sheet, but instead of going 
back to his seat, he went out the door back of me.

37:01.783 --> 37:21.625
And I was halfway through the quiz when I had my back 
seat turned to the class, writing on the board, and

37:01.783 --> 37:21.625
I heard clap, clap, clap, clap, about four steps or 
five, and the noise stopped.

37:24.085 --> 37:27.308
And I turned around and I didn't say anything. But I 
looked up at this student's seat and he wasn't in

37:29.070 --> 37:34.595
it. So I told the student

37:36.437 --> 37:45.585
that was his roommate to tell so-and-so to come see 
me. And I told the class that I wasn't going to give

37:51.355 --> 37:58.204
any grades on the exam until I found out who was the 
guilty party. And so he didn't come, and he didn't

38:00.648 --> 38:16.510
come, and finally I told his roommate to have him 
come see me, and he didn't come. And finally I

38:16.550 --> 38:20.535
caught him going out of place, and I said, you come 
see me today. And he came in and he said he was

38:22.372 --> 38:28.460
determined not to admit anything. And I said to 
him, I said, well, young man, I hold your career in

38:28.500 --> 38:35.689
my hand. You're a medical student. And if your 
major professor, Dr. Gravitt, ever finds out that

38:38.212 --> 38:44.861
you streak my class, your future's not very 
bright. And he said, I was still determined not to

38:46.363 --> 38:49.527
say anything. And I put him down in front of me and I 
said, well, said the man that streaked my class hat

38:51.295 --> 39:01.027
on a red jockey strap. He said, no sir, it was a 
maroon jockey strap. And I said, well, now you

39:07.595 --> 39:20.070
understand that you've done something that has 
really gonna cost you and your career. Dr. Gravitt

39:20.573 --> 39:22.516
won't stand for this. But I didn't report him to Dr. 
Gravitt. But somebody did because Gravitt never

39:26.041 --> 39:32.811
let him go to medical school. He finally went to 
what is this other thing? It's osteopath school.

39:38.740 --> 39:43.827
And both he and his friend got degrees at some 
osteopath college. And one of them was practicing

39:44.188 --> 39:46.952
in Conroe. And I was going to Conroe frequently 
because they had a club over there. So when I got

39:52.181 --> 40:07.579
ready to retire, I went to his friend in Conroe, and 
I said, look, I want to send an invitation to

39:52.181 --> 40:07.579
so-and-so to come to my graduation dinner. And he 
told me where he was, and I sent the letter to this

40:08.881 --> 40:17.631
guy that was in the Army in Illinois, and he replied 
to it. He had a little different scenario than I had

40:17.830 --> 40:32.914
because he didn't see it exactly like I did, but it 
was really an interesting letter and I have got

40:17.830 --> 40:32.914
that in my memoir. I think that answers your 
question, I think. What about some other tricks or

40:38.824 --> 40:42.910
pranks the students attempted? You know, I don't 
remember any other particular ones. Nobody wrote

40:47.892 --> 40:51.316
anything on the board before you got to class? No, 
sir, I don't remember that. Did any student ever

40:53.257 --> 40:56.641
come by and try to bribe you? I think these two boys 
were the only ones that ever really tried to bribe

40:56.661 --> 41:02.166
me. Did anybody

41:02.607 --> 41:09.353
try to high pressure you about a grade? Some 
politician? How did they do that? Well, I gave two

41:14.632 --> 41:19.279
sets of quizzes to every class. And the answers on 
this row and the answers on this row were

41:19.299 --> 41:25.147
different. And whenever somebody turned in a 
paper on this row with answers all on this row, they

41:25.167 --> 41:33.219
didn't get a grade. And I had one or two people to 
come in and complain about that. It didn't do them

41:40.249 --> 41:41.871
any good, but I had a little girl come in to complain 
that she would have done anything I asked of her.

41:49.122 --> 41:52.926
But I knew better than to ask of her. But that's an 
impression that I had. Did any politician or

41:54.949 --> 42:01.376
university administrator try to influence your 
grades ever? Ever. No, never. And I only got one bad

42:04.680 --> 42:11.908
note.

42:13.525 --> 42:24.858
I turned in my grades at 5 o'clock, and they should 
have been in at 1 o'clock, and I got a letter of reply

42:13.525 --> 42:24.858
by endorsement. And I probably did, but my 
secretary had misinformed me as to when they had to

42:24.878 --> 42:32.446
be in. So I wrote a letter of reply by endorsement. 
You mentioned you were active with the young

42:39.715 --> 42:42.578
Republicans. Describe your activity in the 
community and on the campus as a leader of the local

42:44.260 --> 42:53.068
Republican party. Well,

42:54.129 --> 43:07.883
when I first got there and started teaching in 57, I 
went to a, precinct meeting just because I wanted

43:08.183 --> 43:12.168
to find out what was going on. It was at Phil Good's 
house. I know you know that name. And I found out

43:19.476 --> 43:28.106
that all of the Republicans that were active there 
were members of the John Birch Society. And I did

43:29.728 --> 43:31.170
not I did not want to make my membership in the 
Republican Party dependent upon the John Birch

43:32.669 --> 43:39.159
Society. So I did not affiliate with the John Birch 
faction. And I would have my friends write in my

43:45.850 --> 43:53.602
name for precinct chairman. I never tried to put my 
name on the ticket. But my friends would write in my

43:57.728 --> 44:08.761
name that I'd get enough votes to be precinct 
chairman and I'd go to the county chairman and we'd

43:57.728 --> 44:08.761
elect delegates to the state. But I didn't dare go 
to a state Republican convention until 1966. Why

44:15.910 --> 44:16.410
not? I thought there's too much involved.

44:21.516 --> 44:27.043
Did you feel that it was inappropriate for a 
faculty member to do that? It's inappropriate for

44:27.125 --> 44:32.131
Republican members. Oh, you mean... Yes, I do. 
With the Democratic majority. George Raper in the

44:36.537 --> 44:44.367
Postal Department was Democratic chairman for 
years, but they didn't want anybody on the faculty

44:36.537 --> 44:44.367
to be Republican. And I think I told you that when I 
was elected county chairman that the secretary of

44:45.488 --> 44:55.461
the school board, Cherry, asked me to come see him. 
And I conducted the election for the Brazos County

44:58.745 --> 45:03.551
party. And after Clements was elected, he called 
me and said it wouldn't be necessary for me to come

45:04.892 --> 45:10.178
see him. But I felt very strongly that Republicans 
were not They were not tolerated. Did any student

45:22.979 --> 45:30.371
ever say anything about your being politically 
active? No. Did anybody else anywhere near the

45:33.035 --> 45:40.047
university administration ever say anything? 
Never said anything. You see, there's an old man

45:41.690 --> 45:45.276
that was county chairman.

45:47.939 --> 45:52.606
And then he got crossways somehow with somebody I 
don't really know. And I don't even remember his

45:53.447 --> 45:55.290
name. But he had a fuss with somebody and resigned. 
And I got all the precinct chairman together and

46:01.980 --> 46:12.996
only one person voted against me. And that was a 
woman who thought she was a big Republican, but She

46:18.061 --> 46:19.303
really didn't know. She said in the thing, well, 
you don't invite the young people enough. And I

46:28.538 --> 46:37.353
took Gay's son and two or three other people to 
state conventions with me to give them, you know,

46:28.538 --> 46:37.353
Gordon Gay's young son. And to one extent or 
another, I invited their participation.

46:47.120 --> 46:58.094
When Bush was there in 70, I had, I thought, an 
extremely good politician. And I introduced him

46:59.336 --> 47:08.888
to George Bush and recommended him as a staff 
member in 1970 when he was on the campus. And he

47:08.968 --> 47:11.772
interviewed this young man and offered him a job. 
Well, whenever this young man told the people that

47:16.364 --> 47:22.473
he had been sort of working for while he was in 
school, that he had been offered this. They said,

47:24.536 --> 47:27.481
well, we'll give you the same thing George Bush 
does. And he's now president of the Agricultural

47:27.561 --> 47:35.573
Teachers Insurance Company. And Marcus Hill and I 
have been real close ever since then. What's his

47:40.799 --> 47:41.801
name? Marcus Hill. M-A-R-C-U-S. H-I-L-L. Marcus 
Hill. And about several years ago, he invited Jane

47:48.714 --> 47:58.032
and I to come to one of their board meetings.
