WEBVTT

00:02.984 --> 00:07.009
Now, what outfit were you with in the Corps of 
Cadets? I was with the infantry.

00:16.900 --> 00:19.683
What did you think about the hazing at A&M? The 
what? Hazing.

00:24.328 --> 00:31.877
Oh,

00:24.328 --> 00:31.877
from old timers, I'd learned to expect that when I 
got down there.

00:36.751 --> 00:50.151
I

00:36.751 --> 00:50.151
thought it was a kind of a foolish prankster type 
sort of thing that didn't contribute a goddamn

00:36.751 --> 00:50.151
thing to anything.

00:57.162 --> 01:06.015
On the other side of things,

00:57.162 --> 01:06.015
I got involved in it also. Why?

01:16.670 --> 01:33.353
Well, I guess it's

01:16.670 --> 01:33.353
one of these things where you allow

01:16.670 --> 01:33.353
bad habits

01:36.691 --> 01:39.974
or evil things to overcome sound judgment.

01:43.697 --> 01:44.758
And that happens to you. Like drowning out 
someone, you know. I don't know whether you know

01:49.703 --> 01:52.405
what that is. I never beat anybody with a paddle, 
but here's a guy trying to sleep and you go throw a

01:52.425 --> 02:01.413
bucket of water on him. Why do you do that? Well, had 
he done that to you, I don't know who it was, but

02:06.745 --> 02:10.250
you'd think it was him.

02:13.175 --> 02:15.198
What does that contribution mean? Absolutely 
zero.

02:21.368 --> 02:35.149
Or you have a bag full of water

02:21.368 --> 02:35.149
and somebody walks along and you drop it on his head 
from up on the roof. I guess I can best say it's

02:37.238 --> 02:40.681
immaturity. It's the sort of thing that happened 
with all children.

02:46.827 --> 02:48.848
And you're still children when you do that. You're 
not a man. Men don't do those things to each other.

02:54.313 --> 02:54.954
Isn't that right? Men do not do those things to each 
other. It's only children that does that.

03:02.521 --> 03:03.982
And children are immature. Did you learn anything 
from it? Absolutely nothing.

03:13.712 --> 03:14.033
Nothing.

03:16.757 --> 03:19.100
Is that one of the things that you disliked about 
the Corps? No, I really didn't dislike this, but it

03:21.523 --> 03:26.450
made no contribution. Well, what did you like and 
dislike about the Corps of Cadets? What I liked

03:30.376 --> 03:32.659
about the Corps of Cadets is I think the most 
fascinating thing in the world for a man is to see

03:32.926 --> 03:43.158
one guy out as a leader and everybody else is 
studying there to replace him when he goes. And the

03:44.539 --> 03:50.046
preciseness, the discipline involved. That's 
what it's all about. Learning to do things well.

03:54.191 --> 03:55.432
And doing things well. And doing it in such a 
fashion that other people see it and say, oh my God,

03:56.053 --> 04:00.638
aren't they great. Aren't they good? Look how they 
dress. Look how he stands. Look at his clothing.

04:11.426 --> 04:13.369
Look at his whole posture.

04:16.994 --> 04:18.076
Discipline. That's what it's all about. That's 
how you become a successful chairman of the board

04:20.359 --> 04:30.895
or president of United Technology or Martin 
Marietta Corporation or Sears and Roebuck or

04:20.359 --> 04:30.895
anything else. And that is one thing this country 
has the least of, and that's leadership.

04:41.674 --> 04:56.815
I used to stand on the platform at West Point and 
teach psychology of leadership, and I used to say,

04:41.674 --> 04:56.815
all

04:41.674 --> 04:56.815
you fellows are going to be leaders.

05:01.216 --> 05:02.657
I was wrong about that. Only one or two out of a 
hundred are going to be leaders.

05:11.726 --> 05:14.189
You say leaders are made, not born. I can't totally 
subscribe to that. I can't totally subscribe to

05:19.334 --> 05:23.518
all leaders are made and not born. Because you look 
into what I see as a leader it is a

05:29.110 --> 05:58.155
leader has to have a

05:29.110 --> 05:58.155
personality

05:29.110 --> 05:58.155
he has to have a mannerism he has to have a posture he 
has to have a mind he has to have a heart and a soul and

05:58.388 --> 06:19.705
he has to have principles of fair play and justice 
unselfish unbending relentless belief in

05:58.388 --> 06:19.705
principles and a burning desire to continue to 
learn and you put all of that combination together

06:22.165 --> 06:50.535
and stand up then in front of a group of men of

06:22.165 --> 06:50.535
which they're all different from you and they're 
individuals and then you be able to communicate

06:22.165 --> 06:50.535
with them in such a fashion that they all 
understand exactly what it is you want done and

06:22.165 --> 06:50.535
then they go do it That's leadership.

06:55.334 --> 07:00.741
Now, you start looking at all those things, I have 
nothing to do with my personality. I have nothing

07:02.763 --> 07:06.368
to do with my physical posture. I have nothing to do 
with my physical makeup at all, the size of my feet,

07:07.469 --> 07:15.119
my hands, my nose, my face. I have nothing to do with 
that.

07:19.524 --> 07:20.826
I have nothing to do with with, to a large degree, a 
mannerism. The way I talk,

07:26.463 --> 07:41.285
the way I use my hands, the way I walk, and that's a 
motivating thing, an emotional thing,

07:26.463 --> 07:41.285
emotional. It has nothing to do with that. I do have 
a lot of things to do with the learning, to detect,

07:51.805 --> 08:21.677
to represent principles, to build my own 
techniques, my own personal techniques which

07:51.805 --> 08:21.677
apply the principles based on my personality, 
statue, and the things that I had nothing to do

07:51.805 --> 08:21.677
with.

08:23.193 --> 08:28.279
can foster adventure.

08:31.343 --> 08:36.789
I can accept the inborn principle of challenge.

08:40.073 --> 08:50.145
I can work like the devil to get rid of my selfish

08:40.073 --> 08:50.145
I think inborn characteristics.

08:56.386 --> 09:02.913
And

08:56.386 --> 09:02.913
I can continue to discipline myself, which is 
study. You see, discipline is so vital to

09:04.434 --> 09:07.837
everything. Absolutely,

09:10.200 --> 09:16.486
no question about it. Absolutely exactness. See, 
discipline is learning to do things well,

09:18.989 --> 09:25.515
learning to do things so well that they become 
habitual and automatic those good principles you

09:26.103 --> 09:52.414
never have to think about them okay you never have 
to think about those things and they become

09:26.103 --> 09:52.414
habitual and automatic you've learned them so 
well and you believe them so well then your mind is

09:26.103 --> 09:52.414
free to meet the ever-changing situations that 
happen about you that god only knows about that's

09:26.103 --> 09:52.414
going to happen And you're prepared. Then you are 
prepared.

09:58.427 --> 09:58.747
You see? For example, you teach a soldier to

09:59.768 --> 10:09.838
fire his rifle.

10:15.223 --> 10:19.988
And he knows all there is to know about that rifle.

10:24.743 --> 10:47.857
Then as he unexpectedly, or he may expect it, 
receives fire from the enemy, he doesn't have to go

10:24.743 --> 10:47.857
back and say, well, now, I wonder how I load this 
rifle I've got here because that guy's going to

10:24.743 --> 10:47.857
kill me here. How do I load this thing? Or what did 
that sergeant say about how you... move this lever

10:54.967 --> 10:57.692
or that lever to make it shoot. Well, he's dead. 
That's

10:59.375 --> 11:03.382
a visual automatic. It's like teaching a soldier. 
You say there's a little roll in the terrain out

11:05.747 --> 11:09.213
here. Now, you receive fire from out here on the 
battlefield. The first thing you do is you take

11:12.058 --> 11:13.821
cover. Cover? Yeah. Cover in the mind of a soldier 
is cover from the fire. Get behind something or

11:22.493 --> 11:26.339
down low so that that fire won't hit you. Then you 
try to conceal yourself from the enemy.

11:30.645 --> 11:39.658
Concealment is trying to protect yourself so he 
can't see you while you move to go after him. Well,

11:40.419 --> 11:46.928
if you haven't learned those principles so well, 
you're going to be dead. So life's not going to be

11:47.049 --> 11:49.392
very long, isn't it? So this is what I'm talking 
about. Squads right, squads east, squads left,

11:52.824 --> 12:02.959
whatever you want to call it, right and left, 
forward march, always step on your left foot, this

11:52.824 --> 12:02.959
on the fourth, and this same movement. Now you said 
that one of the things that you liked about the

12:02.979 --> 12:10.470
Corps was the leadership possibility. Were you a 
leader in the Corps? Did you have an opportunity? I

12:14.796 --> 12:18.602
was a squad leader in my company. I was a best drill 
cadet in my company.

12:30.185 --> 12:34.729
I was a sergeant.

12:37.532 --> 12:41.255
I was a platoon sergeant. I was a captain on the 
battalion staff. and those were positions of

12:48.299 --> 12:52.684
leadership. Now, you said that one of the things 
that you liked was the discipline. Were there

12:58.029 --> 13:00.211
other things that you liked about the Corps?

13:03.955 --> 13:08.280
Well, I liked the military subjects that they had. 
There were practical subjects, life-saving

13:08.300 --> 13:11.963
subjects.

13:14.846 --> 13:16.568
So you thought you got good instruction? Oh, I got 
fantastic. The best instruction I had was from

13:18.356 --> 13:41.478
those sergeants who had been in the military for 
15, 20 years, and from the officers, and from what

13:18.356 --> 13:41.478
you get, not in the class, but from what you get from 
looking at the individual as an officer. Those

13:41.578 --> 13:43.740
fellows were immaculate. Those models. They're 
models. And they were immaculate. And that's just

13:49.009 --> 13:52.232
an inspiration. There wasn't any non-military 
professors there that wore Art Schaffner mark

13:53.353 --> 14:08.089
suits and all

13:53.353 --> 14:08.089
that sort of stuff. And their shoes were shined and 
their hair immaculate and that sort of stuff. You

14:15.307 --> 14:17.010
only see that in the military. That's where you 
expect it. That's what America expects, and

14:18.332 --> 14:27.246
that's what they deserve because it is different 
from the civilian life. Were there any things

14:28.769 --> 14:38.665
about the Corps that you disliked?

14:47.622 --> 14:55.611
We were an all-white school at that time.

14:55.631 --> 15:05.281
And I suspect that if there had been black students 
at A&M, I don't know whether they had been able to be

14:55.631 --> 15:05.281
in the Corps or not. I don't know. I'm just 
speculating now. I don't know. But

15:09.846 --> 15:16.633
I had nothing but admiration and respect for the 
military curriculum. The way it was conducted I

15:25.004 --> 15:44.916
thought was by the ultimate of professionals and

15:25.004 --> 15:44.916
I guess that there is some harassment there about 
maybe

15:25.004 --> 15:44.916
you worked for an hour and a half shining a buckle or 
something for us, and then for somebody to come by

15:46.010 --> 15:58.402
and say, well, you've got a dirty buckle there, you 
know, you don't go for that sort of stuff. But that

15:58.982 --> 16:02.706
was immaturity sort of stuff amongst the people. 
Now, in what way do you think that the Corps helped

16:04.688 --> 16:08.071
your career? Well, it provided a way of life for me. 
Sort of gave you the foundation of what the

16:14.140 --> 16:17.244
military would be like? Absolutely. Absolutely. 
No question about it. Absolutely. I, uh,

16:25.115 --> 16:29.742
no question about that. Were there any ways in 
which you think that being a member of the Corps of

16:30.182 --> 16:38.133
Cadets might have hurt your career in the long run?

16:41.518 --> 16:43.000
No, I do not think so. It was only helpful, only 
helpful.

16:51.110 --> 17:03.148
And I think that is brought out by my following 36 
years in the military.

17:03.168 --> 17:09.898
Let's now talk about the quality of the product of 
Texas A&M, the second lieutenant. uh tell me what

17:10.267 --> 17:30.773
what do you think are his strengths and weaknesses 
and perhaps you'd like to compare it with those of

17:10.267 --> 17:30.773
the west point second lieutenant

17:40.591 --> 18:09.383
I think that most people will probably disagree 
with my comparisons and my method of comparing,

17:40.591 --> 18:09.383
but I think you get just as few military leaders, 
true leaders that go on to be general officers, I

17:40.591 --> 18:09.383
think you get just as few true leaders out of West 
Point as you get out of Texas A&M. Because you're

18:17.079 --> 18:22.866
second lieutenant that doesn't mean that you're a 
real leader. You're

18:23.246 --> 18:34.199
called a platoon leader if you like with 40 men but 
let's look at it this way. Second lieutenant out of

18:35.100 --> 18:38.003
A&M or out of Citadel or out of VMI or out of the Air 
Force Academy or the Naval Academy or the Military

18:38.692 --> 18:52.046
Academy are the least experienced officers in the 
service, aren't they? Okay. And what are their

18:53.207 --> 18:56.890
responsibilities in the case of the Army? We'll 
stick to the Army.

19:01.235 --> 19:03.037
Who do they lead if they're going to lead? They lead 
the least experienced soldiers in the Army. So

19:09.995 --> 19:27.216
really what we're talking about here is the least 
experienced officer leading the least

19:09.995 --> 19:27.216
experienced enlisted men,

19:09.995 --> 19:27.216
which is a platoon of 25 to 40 people.

19:29.839 --> 19:39.411
Now,

19:29.839 --> 19:39.411
this young officer ends up with an awesome 
responsibility.

19:43.272 --> 19:48.059
And I want to tell you straight forward there isn't 
much leading going on.

19:53.607 --> 20:00.877
And how can you expect the least experienced 
officer in the Army to lead the least experienced

19:53.607 --> 20:00.877
people in the Army? How is he going to lead them? 
Hell, he's been in the academic route for four

20:04.843 --> 20:09.049
years. He's had us. just a smattering of military 
and now here he is.

20:19.336 --> 20:34.917
He needs a lot of help from the senior fellows with 
five or six years service in order for him and from

20:19.336 --> 20:34.917
the senior NCOs. I guess what I'm saying is that 
he's just beginning When he graduated from A&M as a

20:42.520 --> 20:51.733
second lieutenant or West Point as a second A&M, 
he's now prepared to go out and learn something

20:42.520 --> 20:51.733
about what this is all about. And that's the reason 
why the attrition rate is so low at the Air Academy

20:51.773 --> 21:04.830
and Naval Academy and the Military Academy and 
amongst the regulars that leave Texas A&M. The

21:06.533 --> 21:08.916
attrition rate is maybe 40-50% at the end of 10 
years. Why? Well, they can't hack it.

21:20.465 --> 21:23.169
They can't do it. They don't like it. They're in the 
wrong business.

21:30.178 --> 21:37.688
Here's what General Abrams said to the Congress of 
the United States, and this is a matter of record,

21:30.178 --> 21:37.688
and I guess it's in about the 1973 congressional 
record.

21:46.640 --> 22:07.438
He said out of 100,000 officers,

21:46.640 --> 22:07.438
we are looking for four or five, only four or five 
out of 100,000

21:46.640 --> 22:07.438
that we can put at the right place at the right time 
to influence the action and win the battle or the

22:07.739 --> 22:11.343
war. He says, as was the case in Guadalcanal, as was 
the case at An Loc in Vietnam. And I'm the guy he's

22:20.614 --> 22:27.222
talking about there.

22:27.242 --> 22:30.806
So, if you can just get that number. This goes back 
to what I said, the least thing we have

22:38.941 --> 22:41.945
in our society is leadership. Do you think that 
there's a higher probability that those four or

22:42.506 --> 22:50.517
five will come from Texas A&M or West Point? Which 
school or does the ROTC program or the academy, do

22:50.718 --> 22:59.089
they have a higher probability? They complement 
each other. They complement each other very much

23:01.473 --> 23:06.079
because At West Point, it's pure science and 
engineering, hard

23:07.257 --> 23:21.798
engineering sciences and that sort of thing. 
Well, at Texas A&M,

23:22.920 --> 23:31.993
you may end up with a fellow that's a liberal arts 
student or a history student. They're very vital

23:32.394 --> 23:36.420
to complementing the West Point in our society 
because these officers become public servants to

23:37.126 --> 24:06.222
serve 221 million people right today and we've got 
a

23:37.126 --> 24:06.222
lot in order to serve those people you've got to 
come from a cross section of those people

23:37.126 --> 24:06.222
to serve the for the military today, for the Army to 
fulfill its responsibilities to 221 million

24:06.640 --> 24:20.381
people,

24:06.640 --> 24:20.381
it's got to have an officer corps that represents 
all of those people.

24:23.626 --> 24:34.082
You've got to have English majors, history,

24:23.626 --> 24:34.082
all the specific engineerings,

24:35.142 --> 24:38.707
textile, the whole gamut. So, do you get that from 
West Point? No. Now, where is that, but where is the

24:42.393 --> 24:46.038
rest of this supposed to come from? It's got to come 
from ROTC. That's why ROTC is so important to the

24:48.221 --> 24:53.149
military.

24:57.715 --> 25:02.763
And you put that together, and these guys then 
start to school. ROTC graduates, West Point

25:03.830 --> 25:11.720
graduates, all start school and they continue to 
school throughout their entire career. Serving

25:13.923 --> 25:21.372
at the cabinet level, become Secretary of State, 
become President of the United States, and all

25:13.923 --> 25:21.372
these positions. Well, those that do that are 
those who have enriched themselves from all walks

25:21.432 --> 25:32.706
of life brought in by your officer corps. So that's 
an important part of the ROTC officer coming in

25:34.812 --> 25:49.985
with the Army, Navy, and the Air Force academy 
graduates. Now there's probably a higher

25:50.005 --> 25:59.394
percentage of senior officers in the military 
that are from the academies than from the ROTC

25:50.005 --> 25:59.394
programs. Probably there is now. Is there I have 
heard from some quarters that there's some sort of

26:04.732 --> 26:23.409
a club and that the military academy people will 
promote their own faster than they'll promote

26:04.732 --> 26:23.409
ROTC or Texas Aggies and I was wondering if you'd 
respond to that. Is there sort of a, is there that

26:23.489 --> 26:27.993
feeling or is that just about hogwash? That's all 
hogwash and that comes from people who

26:34.448 --> 26:39.455
haven't met the standards. Or they've seen 
somebody been promoted over their head and they

26:40.898 --> 26:49.410
say, oh, he's from West Point or he's from the Air 
Academy or he's from the Naval Academy. That's all

26:49.430 --> 26:50.612
hogwash. As I say, I've been an instructor at West 
Point. And the treatment that I received up there

26:55.459 --> 27:02.970
was absolutely phenomenal from the standpoint of 
me being there. And I've been treated the same

27:04.165 --> 27:10.011
throughout my entire life with the military. I've 
been promoted ahead of my contemporaries in most

27:11.173 --> 27:22.285
every instance of which were West Pointers. So I'd 
say that's a bunch of hogwash. So it's a question of

27:25.669 --> 27:27.210
the quality. It's a question of quality, you see. 
Right now the chairman and joint chief is an OCS

27:29.373 --> 27:34.138
graduate General Vesey from Minnesota, and a 
personal friend of mine. He was vice chief of staff

27:45.164 --> 27:52.737
of the Army before he moved up a few days ago, but Mr. 
Reagan. This is the first time in some time that the

27:54.179 --> 28:01.611
ROTC, General Wyant, who was the Chief of Staff 
before the present Chief of Staff. He was ROTC at

28:06.193 --> 28:11.640
California.

28:13.302 --> 28:28.240
I

28:13.302 --> 28:28.240
think that from the standpoint of your selection 
procedures for general officers are such that It

28:28.793 --> 28:41.226
really doesn't make any difference whether you 
came up through the ranks as a private or whether

28:28.793 --> 28:41.226
you graduated from West Point or whether you 
graduated from Texas A&M, VMI, or the Citadel. It

28:41.307 --> 28:50.817
doesn't make any difference because that cannot 
impact on what you've done. And that's what you're

28:50.877 --> 28:55.722
being promoted on and what you've done and your 
potential. So you think that most of the people who

28:58.679 --> 29:02.124
but for such an idea are just sour grapes. Oh, 
absolutely. No question about it. No question

29:04.868 --> 29:06.611
about it. Now I want to ask you about something else 
that's a little bit more controversial, and this

29:06.631 --> 29:19.650
is an idea often suggested by the press, that 
there's some sort of a military mentality. You've

29:19.811 --> 29:27.522
probably heard of that term, a military 
mentality, a military way to do it, which is much

29:19.811 --> 29:27.522
different than a civilian way to do it. Is there a 
military mentality, and if so, would you find it?

29:31.542 --> 29:35.326
No, I've found no military mentality. I think 
that, again,

29:35.546 --> 29:56.125
we're looking for balance in the military and the 
ROTC product and the soldier off the street

29:35.546 --> 29:56.125
product coming up through the ranks. disavow any 
militaristic approach to things. Too many of us

30:05.303 --> 30:09.047
have served at the cabinet level. Too many have 
been involved in things like trying to get

30:09.147 --> 30:15.895
two-track education systems in high school. Can 
you imagine? I sat for four years as a Deputy

30:17.657 --> 30:26.567
Assistant Secretary of Defense for personnel, 
manpower and personnel. My God, I was involved in

30:27.205 --> 30:36.255
programs that impact on our whole civilian way of 
life. So you can't serve at those levels and say

30:36.955 --> 30:43.783
they're just a militaristic viewpoint. How would 
you like to get involved in trying to save Chrysler

30:45.785 --> 30:55.575
Corporation back in 1953, 54, when they were about 
to go down the damn tube then? I tell you, the thing I

30:56.467 --> 31:11.326
think that most people resent about the military 
is that there is a discipline there.

31:14.129 --> 31:25.984
There is principles laid out on what you want to do, 
and there is an application of these principles in

31:14.129 --> 31:25.984
a precise manner. which should produce the best 
approach to getting something done. And all this

31:34.834 --> 31:37.038
is is orderliness. Orderliness. And I think there 
is an orderly manner of going about getting things

31:41.244 --> 31:57.388
done and the press call this a militaristic 
approach because this orderliness is uncommon to

31:41.244 --> 31:57.388
civilian way of doing business. That's exactly it 
as I see it. That's exactly it. Okay, now when you

32:07.106 --> 32:16.802
finished up at Texas A&M, did you have pretty firm 
ideas about what you wanted to do? Did you want to go

32:16.862 --> 32:18.725
in the military at that time? Did you want a 
civilian job? Can you continue the story? I worked

32:22.170 --> 32:24.574
for a little while. as a civilian, uh, waiting for, 
uh, my, uh, diploma before I went to the military.

32:34.990 --> 32:48.187
And, uh, uh, no, it was never any desire to, uh, I 
could have gone to work for Hughes, too,

32:34.990 --> 32:48.187
uh, but, in Houston. But I, uh, I, uh, wanted to go to 
the military. And, uh, Some of the chaps that

32:56.330 --> 33:10.084
graduated ahead of me were second lieutenants 
down at Fort Sam Houston in the 2nd Infantry

32:56.330 --> 33:10.084
Division, and they had invited me down there on the 
weekend while I was cadet. And at Fort Crockett in

33:10.584 --> 33:25.459
Galveston,

33:10.584 --> 33:25.459
they had a coast artillery regiment down there, 
and I had been invited down there.

33:26.890 --> 33:30.853
I just was totally impressed with this. And 
another thing that I had learned, and that was that

33:32.134 --> 33:53.293
there was a guy named Adolf Hitler that

33:32.134 --> 33:53.293
was playing havoc with things in Western Europe. 
And since I've That coat of arms goes back to 12th

33:58.295 --> 34:14.334
century in England,

33:58.295 --> 34:14.334
English and German extraction.

34:16.717 --> 34:25.467
I

34:16.717 --> 34:25.467
said in my judgment, I didn't have much judgment, 
But I was no different from anybody else that just

34:28.079 --> 34:32.744
graduated from college. Because judgment comes 
from experience and acceptance of

34:34.506 --> 34:39.891
responsibility. Until you've done that, you 
know. He thought that maybe Hitler was... Oh, I

34:43.855 --> 34:47.359
knew he had to. He was going to be running all over 
the place, and I didn't know where the end was going

34:47.379 --> 34:56.989
to be, and I figured that I might as well get in there 
and learn all I can before I have to go. before I, you

34:57.239 --> 35:01.344
know, it would have given me a better break in 
leading the young men. So you joined in 1940. Yeah,

35:03.246 --> 35:05.648
I was a second lieutenant. Received my 
commission, and I went straight away. And so you

35:10.674 --> 35:14.218
were immediately assigned to the 2nd Armored 
Division? At Fort Benning, Georgia. Okay, and

35:16.260 --> 35:20.005
what was your job there? I was a platoon leader. 
Okay. Yeah. And then my education started. Okay,

35:26.939 --> 35:29.582
let's talk about that. My education at that time, 
this was July 1940, I was the only second

35:29.602 --> 35:53.892
lieutenant in a battalion,

35:29.602 --> 35:53.892
in a tank battalion, the third battalion of the 
68th

35:29.602 --> 35:53.892
Armored Regiment Light.

35:57.247 --> 36:01.873
And there were five other officers.

36:04.537 --> 36:07.481
One was a battalion commander who was a major.

36:10.145 --> 36:11.627
I guess there were four other officers. And three 
company commanders who were first lieutenants.

36:20.199 --> 36:21.741
That was all the officers there were. Normally you 
have about 40 officers in there, but that's all. I

36:26.491 --> 36:28.273
was the only non-West Pointer. I was a second 
lieutenant.

36:33.698 --> 36:54.237
And I said, well, I gotta, the major, the battalion 
commander, he told me, he said, now, in addition to

36:33.698 --> 36:54.237
you being platoon leader, I want you to be aid to 
Colonel

36:33.698 --> 36:54.237
George S. Patton at the division headquarters 
when you go on field maneuvers. I want you to work

36:55.482 --> 37:08.056
with him, and I want you to be my exec, and I want you 
to be my supply officer, and I want you to be my

36:55.482 --> 37:08.056
personnel officer, and then my operations 
officer here in the battalion headquarters. At

37:08.116 --> 37:21.490
the meantime, you're going down to I Company, and I 
want you to learn all there is to running a company.

37:24.423 --> 37:39.884
Ms. Hollingsworth had graduated, just graduated 
from Texas A&M, I mean from TWU, and so we lived off

37:24.423 --> 37:39.884
post. War was coming at Columbia, Columbus, 
South, Columbus, Georgia, Columbus, Georgia.

37:50.859 --> 37:53.282
She didn't see very much of me except maybe few 
hours on Sunday because I had about five sergeants

37:53.515 --> 38:12.861
who probably in experience for exceeded the 
capabilities of our PhDs today. They were PhDs in

38:14.704 --> 38:20.772
the art of soldiering because they all had about 15 
years of eighteen year service. First Sergeant

38:23.302 --> 38:29.448
Latham, First Sergeant Latham had about eighteen 
year service. He was the first sergeant and the top

38:31.670 --> 38:45.122
sergeant and then there was Sergeant Bardinelli, 
he was a mess sergeant and you used to have a mess

38:31.670 --> 38:45.122
account where you got so much money and he had to 
manage that. I had to learn to manage that. He

38:46.744 --> 38:47.865
bought the food. You got some issue food but he 
bought food. for these hundred and twenty-five

38:51.447 --> 38:54.030
men in the company. Then there was Supply Sergeant 
Murphy in response for all the supplies for that

38:55.191 --> 39:03.460
company. Then there was Sergeant Heiss who was a 
maintenance sergeant for the seventeen tanks,

39:04.862 --> 39:18.197
four motorcycles,

39:19.038 --> 39:25.167
three-quarter ton truck and one two-and-a-half 
ton truck and a mess truck. And then there was a

39:26.930 --> 39:37.286
favorite platoon sergeant of mine named 
Stanford, Sergeant Stanford. He was a tactician.

39:43.135 --> 39:44.437
So I went to school. I set an objective for myself, 
which was to drain those guys dry. Stanford was the

39:50.485 --> 39:53.490
junior of the lot. He only had about 14 years 
service.

39:58.977 --> 40:12.096
My objective was to absorb

39:58.977 --> 40:12.096
each of those fellows Total years of experience.

40:19.734 --> 40:23.719
And that was a hell of an undertaking. But I felt I 
had to have that.

40:29.107 --> 40:38.220
So I called them in my later years the five great 
professors of my life. Because they made me

40:38.240 --> 40:41.745
successful. You see? I have to accept the fact that 
I was successful whether I'm blowing my own horn or

40:43.008 --> 41:11.057
not but they are responsible

40:43.008 --> 41:11.057
as far as I'm concerned for me learning the real art 
of the trade and my father provided me and my mother

41:12.927 --> 41:18.012
with what's necessary, with how to take that art 
and apply it. That's how plain and simple it is.

41:22.456 --> 41:26.800
What were some of the tips that they gave you? Well, 
first place, they insisted that I learn all there

41:26.820 --> 41:36.428
was about each of those things, even the cooking.

41:39.451 --> 41:41.533
The first sergeant taught me that if a platoon of 
twenty-five men do something wrong don't punish

41:42.610 --> 42:11.419
the whole platoon punish or ferried out and 
correct the one single one responsible

41:42.610 --> 42:11.419
because all five of the tanks went in the wrong 
direction. Don't call all the crews down and

42:14.257 --> 42:19.221
reprimand them for that. Find out who it was that 
somebody there to respond to that. That's right.

42:27.349 --> 42:29.291
That was very important early. There was a 
continuation of this business of doing

42:31.413 --> 42:35.576
everything right. In keeping a record, I'd say 
Sergeant Major, or Sergeant Murphy, Why did you do

42:42.753 --> 42:44.435
this? Why did you put a mark here? Why are you 
required to use the same colored ink? Well, you're

42:51.202 --> 42:56.727
required to use the same black ink on this and red 
ink over here for a simple reason. We're talking

42:58.549 --> 43:01.652
about deficits and we're talking about credits.

43:05.376 --> 43:11.983
You're required to have so many tent pegs in this 
company and this is very important because if you

43:05.376 --> 43:11.983
don't, some guy when you go out here the in the woods 
and the wind is blowing and raining at night one

43:12.301 --> 43:36.739
tent peg is not there means that that one's going to 
blow away he said do you understand that i said why

43:12.301 --> 43:36.739
why you got why don't you what are you doing you got 
all of you got all the flashlights stacked over

43:12.301 --> 43:36.739
here on one side and and you've got all the 
batteries stacked over here, and Colonel Patton

43:37.411 --> 43:46.124
just raised hell yesterday about us preparing for 
war, and we're not preparing for war. If you've got

43:46.204 --> 43:53.636
flashlights over here and things over here, and we 
have to go to war in the morning, now we've got to put

43:46.204 --> 43:53.636
those together. And somebody's liable to come in 
here and forget the, got the flashlights and

43:54.317 --> 44:00.005
forget the batteries. Well, and he goes, through 
about the maintenance of this equipment and why

44:04.175 --> 44:17.109
you don't want a battery to go bad in a flashlight 
and destroy the flashlight and all that sort of

44:04.175 --> 44:17.109
stuff. Then in the maintenance,

44:17.169 --> 44:23.877
you learn to time the tank engines. You learn to 
help take them out. You learn all there is to know

44:26.800 --> 44:29.823
about it. Sergeant Heiss said to me, he said, if you 
don't learn all this, How do you know wherever you

44:34.178 --> 44:44.689
go from here and whatever units you have, how do you 
know whether or not that sergeant is snowing you or

44:34.178 --> 44:44.689
not about what's going on? I said, I never thought 
about that, Sergeant Hines. Will a sergeant do

44:48.773 --> 44:50.074
that? He said, sergeants are people.

44:58.703 --> 45:00.665
And people are all different, he told me. I 
thought. You're telling me something that I told

45:03.980 --> 45:07.965
my father when I was ten years old.

45:11.510 --> 45:13.833
So these men taught you the practical trade? 
Absolutely, absolutely, no question about it.

45:18.800 --> 45:19.982
How long were you in Georgia? I was there a year and a 
while, then I was sent off to to an automotive

45:29.748 --> 45:40.579
course at Fort Knox, which was the only schooling I 
had after I left Texas A&M until after the war. And

45:42.481 --> 45:47.866
what did they try to teach you at the automotive

45:42.481 --> 45:47.866
course? To move large armored formations like the 
Second Armored Division with 300 plus tanks,
