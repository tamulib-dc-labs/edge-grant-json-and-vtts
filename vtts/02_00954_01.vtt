00:01.685 --> 00:07.613
History 374, Semester Project, interview by 
Steve Brown. Oh, interviewee is Sam Gideon,

00:09.796 --> 00:22.494
former general manager of the Lower Colorado 
River Authority, to be referred to as LCRA.

00:23.796 --> 00:24.537
Question number one. Who was most responsible for 
getting the LCRA started? Well, it'd be pretty

00:31.807 --> 01:00.615
difficult to say who was most responsible because 
it was a culmination of efforts that had been going

00:31.807 --> 01:00.615
on for, oh, I guess 20 or 30 years, trying to create 
something that could be used in order to build dams

00:31.807 --> 01:00.615
above Austin that would control the floods that 
were devastating the river below Austin around

00:31.807 --> 01:00.615
Columbus and Eagle Lake and Wharton. And the 
people down there had organized and tried to do

01:01.169 --> 01:13.768
something for many, many years, but I would guess 
that the one most responsible would be a man by the

01:01.169 --> 01:13.768
name of A.J. Wertz, W-I-R-T-Z, who was a lawyer 
here in Austin, had been Undersecretary of the

01:13.788 --> 01:25.827
Interior under Ickes, but had been interested in 
water development in Texas for many, many years.

01:33.469 --> 01:34.310
Okay. How much of an impact was the Tennessee 
Valley Authority on the formation of the LCRA?

01:41.500 --> 01:56.100
Well, the Tennessee Valley Authority had no 
impact other than it was just an illustration of

01:41.500 --> 01:56.100
what could be done.

01:56.823 --> 02:09.442
the reason for the LCRA was local and not based on 
anything that had happened over in Tennessee.

02:09.463 --> 02:09.883
Okay.

02:14.911 --> 02:22.763
Many people attribute the early economic growth 
of Central Texas, that is, after the after the

02:23.553 --> 02:26.337
Great Depression to the LCRA. Do you agree with 
that? Well, I think that you would have to do that

02:27.859 --> 02:50.488
because the LCRA brought into the area a control of 
the floods that sort of would ruin the cities down

02:27.859 --> 02:50.488
below Austin, and including Austin, where it 
would ruin their water systems, their sewerage

02:27.859 --> 02:50.488
systems, And then, in addition, the LCRA brought 
into the area a plentiful supply of water, which in

02:50.857 --> 03:02.890
Texas is something that is needed for growth. And 
then the LCRA brought into the area a plentiful

03:03.791 --> 03:17.505
supply of low-cost electric power back in the 
1940s.

03:17.975 --> 03:23.342
when electricity could be bought at a much cheaper 
rate than it is now. And by virtue of having the

03:23.362 --> 03:37.499
cheap lower rates, the

03:23.362 --> 03:37.499
people were able to take advantage of all these 
other things that I'm talking about in the way of

03:23.362 --> 03:37.499
water and flood control. And it became a very 
desirable place in which to live. There were no

03:42.145 --> 03:43.847
private homes? private companies already 
involved? There were private utilities already

03:48.146 --> 03:50.749
in Texas. The city of Austin owned its own system, 
but the private utilities were having

03:51.650 --> 04:05.603
difficulties reaching out and going into the 
rural areas because it was too costly. And what the

04:06.484 --> 04:15.353
LCRA did was take advantage of the laws that were 
being passed in the under what was called New Deal

04:15.586 --> 04:44.867
under Roosevelt, where money was being made 
available to local cities and towns and rural

04:15.586 --> 04:44.867
areas so that they could either buy or build their 
electric systems because it was the feeling of

04:15.586 --> 04:44.867
Roosevelt that economical electricity was 
necessary in order to keep people on the farms and

04:15.586 --> 04:44.867
in order to keep the rural areas to where they could 
continue to make a living and be a desirable place

04:45.168 --> 04:49.293
in which to live. So what happened was that the 
LCRA, after it got started, bought out the area in

04:50.034 --> 05:04.391
Central Texas from the private utilities and 
developed the area itself.

05:11.100 --> 05:13.943
Obviously, there was a lot of construction And as 
you say, buying of people's lands. What

05:17.878 --> 05:25.431
relationship or contact with environmentalists 
did the SRA have, or do they have now? Well, back in

05:25.451 --> 05:29.738
1940, wasn't anybody worried about the 
environment. And there wasn't any contacts with

05:30.099 --> 05:34.106
the environmentalists as they are today. In the 
first place, the people were When the authority

05:39.995 --> 05:43.900
started in 34, the people didn't have jobs. They 
had to make a living. They were in the Great

05:45.542 --> 05:52.149
Depression, and anything that would give jobs was 
looked upon with great favor. In the second place,

05:53.050 --> 06:08.128
you didn't have all the industries and the 
automobiles and the airplanes and the factories

05:53.050 --> 06:08.128
and everything that today are state-owned. 
affect the environment and therefore what was

06:08.767 --> 06:38.453
done back in 1934 and 40 in constructing dams and 
clearing the area for dams and reservoirs had no

06:08.767 --> 06:38.453
effect on the environment and furthermore the 
dams were built in the hill country above Austin

06:08.767 --> 06:38.453
and primarily the land was covered with cedar up 
there and it was a very harmful to the people, cedar

06:39.023 --> 06:43.087
was. It caused people to have hay fever. It got on 
the land and took it over and grass wouldn't grow

06:46.330 --> 06:54.338
under it, so it was worthless. And it was good to get 
it cleared off.

07:00.445 --> 07:04.329
You said that the LCRA helped in times of flood. How 
does it help in times of drought? Well, in times of

07:09.145 --> 07:21.083
drought, what it does, it takes the waters that 
have been stored during flood times, and it

07:09.145 --> 07:21.083
releases those waters gradually as they are 
needed downstream. So in drought times, they let

07:21.724 --> 07:38.089
water out of the lakes in order to take care of needs 
of municipalities like Austin and on downstream,

07:21.724 --> 07:38.089
and then primarily to take care of the rice crop 
that grows down in the area around Columbus and

07:38.693 --> 07:43.799
Wharton and Eagle Lake and Bay City. Back before 
the dams and the LCRA, they were able to raise the

07:44.499 --> 07:51.967
rice crop about once every three years. And then 
the other years, they might or might not have

07:52.828 --> 07:56.192
enough water. After the LCRA, they were able to 
plan on raising the crop every year and have been

07:56.873 --> 08:04.040
able to do that. And the amount, the value 
increased uh from the standpoint of raising crops

08:08.377 --> 08:35.042
have been many millions of dollars every year in 
addition the land has become more valuable that's

08:08.377 --> 08:35.042
helped the local areas the local school systems 
the local cities and counties and in addition it

08:08.377 --> 08:35.042
keeps the people busy every year because they know 
they're going to get a crop they know there's

08:08.377 --> 08:35.042
enough water as an example during the draft In the 
early 50s, there'd been about 10 years there when

08:35.326 --> 08:42.915
there really wasn't very much rain in Texas. And 
the LCRA nearly had to drain their lakes to keep

08:43.696 --> 08:52.527
enough water going downstream, but they did that 
and then finally it rained. So during the drought,

08:53.328 --> 09:01.958
what they do, they let water out that they caught 
during floods.

09:05.768 --> 09:09.252
When the SRA was formed, it is a state agency. It is a 
state agency created by the legislature of the

09:09.472 --> 09:14.218
state of Texas. Well, there's obviously some 
politics involved, but how much political

09:14.238 --> 09:20.485
mingling is there? I mean, is there certain 
administrators that get involved in it and try to

09:20.625 --> 09:28.193
influence people in some way? Well, of course, 
there's a lot of politics involved in anything

09:29.054 --> 09:34.881
that's done. You've got several river 
authorities in Texas. There's the Brazos River

09:37.896 --> 09:51.328
Authority and the Trinity River Authority and 
Guadalupe River Authority and the Nueces River

09:37.896 --> 09:51.328
Authority, San Antonio River Authority, and 
several others, and all of them involve politics.

09:52.029 --> 10:03.619
The LCRA probably involved more politics because 
it was being created and it's the only one at that

09:52.029 --> 10:03.619
time that had any electric power. And so 
therefore, the private utilities, electric

10:04.105 --> 10:15.220
utilities, didn't want to see it built because 
they didn't want it competing with them for

10:04.105 --> 10:15.220
electric customers. And there was a great deal of 
politics involved and trading back and forth. And

10:20.688 --> 10:24.473
finally, it was worked out. Everybody seemed to 
think probably is the best thing. And then it

10:27.337 --> 10:31.463
brought about flood control.

10:32.422 --> 10:34.224
product of what they were doing, too. As a state 
agency, is there much influence on turning a

10:36.567 --> 10:46.778
profit in the LCRA with its electric power? Is 
there much what? Is there much incentive for

10:49.161 --> 10:51.583
turning a profit? Oh, no, because the law that 
creates the authority says that it shall not make a

10:52.064 --> 10:57.670
profit. All that it does is make enough to pay its 
expenses and to keep its facilities, equipment,

10:58.207 --> 11:15.188
and property in good shape and make enough so that 
it can continue to build for the future in order to

10:58.207 --> 11:15.188
meet the needs of customers. But the act provides 
that it shall not make a profit. And while it makes

11:21.316 --> 11:25.902
money from the standpoint of selling electricity 
and selling water, that money must be used in

11:26.253 --> 11:54.184
paying its expenses paying off the debt that it 
borrows to build the dams and and the power plants

11:26.253 --> 11:54.184
and the transmission line and to build for the 
future so that the people that are relying on the

11:26.253 --> 11:54.184
lcra will not all of a sudden find out that they 
don't have any body to supply them with power and

11:26.253 --> 11:54.184
water

11:26.253 --> 11:54.184
uh what is the relationship between the federal 
government and the LCRA. Well, the federal

12:00.236 --> 12:06.142
government, there is no relationship from the 
standpoint of politics. The LCRA was created by

12:07.503 --> 12:11.607
the state legislature. The members of the 
governing board, it's run by a board of directors.

12:15.931 --> 12:18.173
They are all appointed by the governor of Texas. 
They have to be approved by the state senate. And

12:21.877 --> 12:24.559
the federal government has nothing to do with 
that. When the LCRA was started, there wasn't any

12:25.130 --> 12:33.021
place you could borrow any money, except from the 
federal government, because the banks wouldn't

12:25.130 --> 12:33.021
loan you any money. And the private people didn't 
have any money to buy bonds to help construct dams

12:33.662 --> 12:42.093
and things like that. So the only place you could go 
to borrow money was to the federal government. And

12:47.000 --> 12:48.723
that's what the cities were doing. The municipal 
buildings were being built by federal money. The

12:53.058 --> 13:06.318
federal agencies were created, Public Works 
Administration and the Reconstruction Finance

12:53.058 --> 13:06.318
Corporation created in Washington the loan money 
so that it would put people back to work. And so the

13:07.219 --> 13:13.228
LCRA went to the federal government to borrow 
their first money. The legislature that created

13:13.809 --> 13:20.078
the authority gave the LCRA $15,000. and to get 
started on, and said that had to be paid back out of

13:20.429 --> 13:27.679
the first month, and said that it could not levy a 
tax. So the only way it can borrow any money is to

13:28.260 --> 13:34.749
agree to pay it out of the revenues that it made. So 
the authority went to the federal government and

13:35.470 --> 13:40.537
borrowed the money to get started. And that's 
where the, and in order to build rural lines and

13:41.078 --> 13:49.930
help the rural electric cooperatives, The LCRA 
later borrowed money from the federal

13:50.281 --> 13:53.826
government. But the only relation was that in the 
borrowing of money, the federal government had no

13:54.527 --> 14:13.053
regulations, no right to say anything to the 
authority about how it was run, what it did, or

13:54.527 --> 14:13.053
anything else. And in 1942, the LCRA paid back the 
government the money that it had borrowed and went

14:19.745 --> 14:49.735
into the open market in New York City and borrowed 
money on the bond market because by then it had

14:19.745 --> 14:49.735
gotten to where it could borrow money publicly and 
the recession was getting over and the war was on

14:19.745 --> 14:49.735
and there was money available to be loaned to build 
electric plants and dams and transmission lines

14:19.745 --> 14:49.735
and things like that. In

14:50.086 --> 15:04.667
1958, the then Senator Lyndon Johnson said, Of all 
endeavors on which I have worked in public life, I

14:50.086 --> 15:04.667
am proudest of the accomplishments in developing 
the lower Colorado River. How much influence did

15:06.109 --> 15:09.474
Johnson have in the LCR? Well, Johnson, from the 
standpoint of having influence, what he did was

15:09.494 --> 15:19.789
help the authority in Washington when they needed 
help to get started. because he, the congressman

15:20.326 --> 15:28.815
in Texas, at the time the LCRA got started, Texas 
had some very powerful congressmen. They had Sam

15:28.835 --> 15:45.372
Rayburn, who later became Speaker of the House, 
and then in the LCRA district, Buck Hannon was from

15:28.835 --> 15:45.372
Brenham, that's in the district, and he was 
chairman of the Finance Commit, Appropriations

15:28.835 --> 15:45.372
Committee, and then The man from Columbus was 
chairman of the Committee on Building Dams. And so

15:52.055 --> 16:03.351
they were very helpful in getting the money needed 
by OCRA to get started, getting loans made to them.

16:03.371 --> 16:09.819
And then after they died, Johnson was elected 
congressman from this area. And he was very

16:10.480 --> 16:12.523
helpful in getting the money loan to LCRA so that it 
could build these dams and build the rural lines

16:13.162 --> 16:39.107
because when he became congressman while very few 
people out in his district had electric power out

16:13.162 --> 16:39.107
on farms or ranches and by the time he got through 
and got elected to the Senate practically every

16:13.162 --> 16:39.107
farm in his area that wanted power had electric 
power. So what he did was to help in Washington get a

16:41.191 --> 16:50.105
LCRA where it could borrow the money, which it paid 
back in full with interest. But he got it when they

16:50.125 --> 16:55.133
couldn't borrow money anywhere else because 
money wasn't available.

16:59.259 --> 17:07.632
Getting off the subject of the LCRA, since we 
mentioned Johnson, you were a personal friend of

16:59.259 --> 17:07.632
his. What kind of a man was he? What do you think? I 
mean, that's a broad question. Well, that's a

17:13.557 --> 17:16.560
broad question in a way. The only answer I have is 
that, yes, I knew him from, I lived right across the

17:16.881 --> 17:34.283
street from him when long before he got, I mean, 
before he got elected to Congress and knew him

17:16.881 --> 17:34.283
while he was a congressman and worked with him on, 
he helped us with the LCRA and And as far as I was

17:34.921 --> 17:39.025
concerned, he was always my friend, very nice. His 
family was nice. We'd go to Washington. He'd

17:41.467 --> 17:43.369
invite us out to his home. When he was president, he 
invited my son, myself, down to the White House and

17:44.070 --> 17:50.356
had them show us the White House. And I never did 
have too much other business dealings with him. So

17:57.963 --> 18:04.810
I wasn't around him in a political way because I 
never did run for office and never did get involved

18:05.110 --> 18:15.885
in races other than donating money and time and 
driving my car and blowing the horn when they made

18:05.110 --> 18:15.885
speeches back in those days. All the candidates 
had to go out to the various country fairs and all

18:16.046 --> 18:25.599
their friends went along, you know, and blew their 
horns when they made speeches trying to make

18:16.046 --> 18:25.599
noise. But I didn't really get involved with him, 
politically speaking, so he was a very a nice

18:34.962 --> 18:39.850
friend to me, and his family has always been nice 
and friendly. He never did ask me to do anything.

18:44.618 --> 18:54.634
When I was manager of OCRA, he would recommend 
people, but if we didn't hire him, that was all

18:44.618 --> 18:54.634
right, too. So actually, I cannot pass too much on 
his type of man he was, from a political standpoint

19:02.840 --> 19:10.570
because I wasn't associated with him politically 
and I wasn't associated with his financing part.

19:11.271 --> 19:13.634
So I really don't know that much. It's just as a 
neighbor that I knew him and he was always

19:13.694 --> 19:22.305
neighborly and friendly and would help if you 
needed a little help. That's about all I know.

19:26.831 --> 19:29.134
Okay, getting back to the LCRA,

19:31.358 --> 19:35.503
It is a major electric power producer in the Hill 
Country area. Has it ever looked into or thought

19:35.843 --> 19:46.897
about other forms of energy, as nuclear energy or 
solar energy or something? Oh, yes. In fact,

19:48.839 --> 19:51.182
they're in other energy. In 1964, they built their 
first coal plant because There's not enough water

19:56.823 --> 20:03.394
on the Colorado River to generate enough 
electricity to take care of the need. So they built

20:05.838 --> 20:16.576
a coal plant and then they built another coal plant 
down here in Fayette County near LaGrange and

20:05.838 --> 20:16.576
they're talking and planning now to build a 
lignite plant. They have looked at nuclear energy

20:16.596 --> 20:21.244
and of course Solar energy is something nice to 
talk about, but it's just not practical as yet and

20:21.578 --> 20:30.671
probably won't be for another 20 or 30 years. And 
you can't sit and wait 20 or 30 years because people

20:30.751 --> 20:40.045
want their electricity when they want the lights 
to burn and the television to run. They don't want

20:40.085 --> 20:42.308
it 20 years from now. So yes, they've looked at 
other things. And as I say, there's not enough

20:45.493 --> 20:48.497
water to generate any more power, water power. So 
they've turned to coal, and they have two coal

20:52.263 --> 20:59.990
plants now, and they're getting ready to build a 
big lignite plant. What exactly are we talking

21:00.170 --> 21:09.238
about in terms of amount of electricity being 
served to people and water available to the

21:00.170 --> 21:09.238
people? Some broad amount. How much are we talking 
about? Well, I don't know. and exactly how to

21:18.363 --> 21:46.834
measure it from the standpoint of electricity, 
but they sell electricity to about 30 towns in

21:18.363 --> 21:46.834
central Texas, all the way from Brenham and 
Smithville and Bastrop up to San Samba,

21:18.363 --> 21:46.834
Kerrville, San Marcos, Georgetown, 
Hattiesville, and towns like that, Luling. Then

21:47.337 --> 22:01.777
they serve 10 electric cooperatives that serve 
about, I guess those cooperatives serve about,

21:47.337 --> 22:01.777
oh, several hundred thousand people on farms and 
ranches. And then the towns they serve, I'm sure,

22:02.738 --> 22:06.924
half a million people. So you're talking about 
lots of power and enough to serve, Well, you're not

22:17.560 --> 22:32.499
talking about, say, as much power it would take to 
serve the city of Houston, but you're talking

22:17.560 --> 22:32.499
about enough power that would serve, say, the city 
of Brown, which owns its own electric system, and I

22:17.560 --> 22:32.499
think serves College Station. The LCRA probably 
has about 20 times as much power as they do, and

22:34.482 --> 22:43.794
that's just a real rough guess. It may be much more 
than that. Okay, you joined the LCRA in 1940? Yes,

22:52.413 --> 23:07.834
but I was working for Mr. Wertz in 1934 when the LCRA 
Act was written, and I was sort of carrying the

22:52.413 --> 23:07.834
books and things like that while he was general 
counsel from 34 to 40. Then when he went to

23:07.854 --> 23:16.947
Washington as undersecretary of the interior in 
1940, I became general counsel, and then Stayed

23:17.365 --> 23:21.611
that way until 48, and then I became assistant 
general manager. And then in 1956, I became

23:21.651 --> 23:27.679
general manager and stayed there until I retired 
in 1973. So actually, I worked for the LCRA more or

23:27.739 --> 23:34.308
less full time from 1940 to 1973. And you are 
somewhat still involved with them? No, not now. I

23:41.498 --> 23:43.441
don't do anything. I'm retired. in 19 when i went 
with them in 1948 they didn't have a retirement

23:46.188 --> 24:15.570
system and i felt like in order to get good 
employees you had to have one so i set up a

23:46.188 --> 24:15.570
retirement system and since it was the first one in 
texas for a public agency while we had to take it all

23:46.188 --> 24:15.570
the way to the supreme court be sure that it was 
valid and we did and then the court held that that it

23:46.188 --> 24:15.570
was valid as i set it up so uh we put in the retirement 
system that when a man got to be 65, he had to retire.

24:21.831 --> 24:24.255
And of course, at that time, I didn't think I'd ever 
be 65. But when the time came, like everybody else,

24:24.656 --> 24:29.544
I had to retire. And then when you retire, I've done 
a few things for them when things have come up

24:29.564 --> 24:39.941
involving something 20 or 30 years ago that nobody 
else knew about. And then I've read, bills

24:43.057 --> 24:46.941
introduced in the legislature and told them what 
the effect would be. But other than that, I'm not

24:47.022 --> 24:50.586
connected with them at all. I'm just on a retired 
basis. The LCA was the first state agency to have a

24:54.050 --> 24:59.216
retirement program? To have a retirement program 
that was carried by an

24:59.536 --> 25:08.246
insurance company. Ours is Prudential Insurance 
Company and other companies, they get it by virtue

25:10.462 --> 25:18.253
of bidding on the premium. And I believe ours was 
the first one because I know that we had to go to the

25:18.894 --> 25:32.032
Supreme Court to establish that we had a right to 
take money and use it for our retirement system.

25:32.633 --> 25:37.600
Now, the reason was, you see, we were taking money 
that we collected as revenues. Now, if the

25:38.137 --> 25:44.905
legislature wanted to appropriate money, they 
could do that and set up a retirement system. But

25:45.446 --> 25:52.734
you couldn't take revenue money until the LCRA 
tested it out and found out that you could.

25:55.518 --> 25:57.881
You said that you were involved with the LCRA since 
1934. How much change have you seen? Obviously,

26:01.185 --> 26:03.267
there's been tremendous change. Well, the 
primary change, of course, is just in numbers. And

26:07.921 --> 26:35.481
then also the change in the fact that back in 1934 
everybody thought that the Colorado River would

26:07.921 --> 26:35.481
always have enough water to take care of the 
electric needs, but what no one expected in 1940

26:07.921 --> 26:35.481
was that after the war was over you had such a 
pent-up demand for equipment that would use

26:07.921 --> 26:35.481
electric power that And then when the rural areas 
came on, people started using from 5, 10, 15, 20,

26:35.647 --> 26:49.230
and 50 times as much electricity, and nobody had 
anticipated anything like that. And so the main

26:49.931 --> 27:00.709
change has been in the way people use electricity 
now from the way they used it back in 1930 and early

26:49.931 --> 27:00.709
part of 1940. You didn't have electric 
refrigeration. I mean, you had a little of it, but

27:04.142 --> 27:06.084
not much. You didn't have air conditioning. You 
didn't have television. You didn't have many,

27:09.508 --> 27:11.791
many things. You didn't have electric dryers, 
washers, washing machines. You didn't have on the

27:16.557 --> 27:20.562
farms electric milking machines. You didn't have 
so many things that have been brought on. The main

27:24.586 --> 27:27.490
change is the fact that living has just been made 
more comfortable by having lots of electric power

27:28.263 --> 27:32.728
available.

27:37.773 --> 27:44.200
Another great change is the use of the lakes for 
recreation purposes. When they first came out,

27:44.301 --> 27:57.595
the lakes were there, nobody much went up to the 
lakes, but my goodness, after 1940, everybody had

27:44.301 --> 27:57.595
to buy a boat, everybody had to have a cabin on the 
lake, and has figured that at least a million

27:57.997 --> 28:02.341
people a year use these lakes. They're free, and 
it's brought about a tremendous impact on the

28:02.401 --> 28:17.135
economy, but as well as the general welfare and the 
happiness of the people, the fact that these lakes

28:02.401 --> 28:17.135
are here, available for recreation. After the 
war, recreation became more available to people,

28:17.796 --> 28:27.885
and that's a great change from what it was in 1930 
and 1940. Another change that during the war the

28:28.169 --> 28:51.898
LCRA worked with all the private utilities 
because of the need for more and more power and

28:28.169 --> 28:51.898
particularly in Houston because they were being 
loads were being dumped on them for building for

28:28.169 --> 28:51.898
the war effort and as a result the Private 
Utilities and LCRA worked up a very fine working

28:52.823 --> 28:57.694
relationship. And they've worked together and 
continue to work together. They have their lines

29:00.500 --> 29:02.244
interconnected. They can help each other during 
emergencies. They can help each other during

29:04.909 --> 29:07.295
storms. They can help each other if they need help 
because of unexpected loads, and that is what's

29:11.622 --> 29:17.231
going on now in Texas. Everybody in the electric 
business is helping each other for the benefit of

29:17.331 --> 29:24.623
the state and the benefit of the people that are 
being served. And that was not so in 1940 and 1930,

29:25.444 --> 29:32.415
but primarily because it wasn't needed then. And 
during the war, when we had so much demands and so

29:32.834 --> 29:46.226
unexpected demands, it became necessary for all 
of them to be interconnected and work together.

29:46.286 --> 29:50.449
And they've been doing that now since 1915. It's 
just worked out fine for everybody.

29:55.994 --> 30:01.339
The private connector companies are turning more 
and more to coal power, aren't they? Well,

30:05.520 --> 30:20.020
everybody is, because the federal government 
kept trying to make Texas give away their gas, so to

30:05.520 --> 30:20.020
speak, kept the price so low. that everybody in the 
north and east started buying gas, and then the gas

30:20.455 --> 30:38.300
supply went down, and then the federal government 
got scared and said that you couldn't build any

30:20.455 --> 30:38.300
more gas plants, gas-fired plants, for 
generating electricity. So you either had to go to

30:38.861 --> 30:41.164
oil or coal. And when they started going to oil, the 
price of oil went out the ceiling, and you had

30:42.006 --> 30:47.914
the... the threat from the Near East and they 
raised the price so coal became the...
