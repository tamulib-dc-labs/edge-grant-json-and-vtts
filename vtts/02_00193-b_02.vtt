WEBVTT

00:03.001 --> 00:09.918
So she came out to San Francisco, we got married there, December the 1st, 1943.

00:12.645 --> 00:19.542
And my ship was in there for one month, we got that much time together, and then we went out again and so she went home here.

00:20.180 --> 00:21.502
Now you served in the Pacific?

00:21.882 --> 00:22.123
Yes.

00:22.243 --> 00:22.744
Primarily?

00:22.944 --> 00:24.666
Yes.

00:25.087 --> 00:40.468
And during the war, were you aware of any preparation you received at A&M that helped you be a better officer?

00:42.090 --> 00:42.651
I think so.

00:43.492 --> 00:50.001
For example, one of the first things when I arrived, even from the very beginning, when I arrived in midshipmen school,

00:50.217 --> 00:52.400
All of us had to have college degrees, et cetera.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.923
And I was there just a very short time.

00:55.864 --> 00:59.829
And of course we had a little history of our lives written up and so on.

00:59.850 --> 01:07.299
And I had indicated I had been in ROTC and I had been in the National Guard.

01:08.260 --> 01:10.543
And so I wasn't there just a very few days.

01:10.684 --> 01:16.511
And I was called out and I was a one striper.

01:16.791 --> 01:19.515
I was a student.

01:22.583 --> 01:27.168
student officer, if you want to call it that, of our group.

01:28.229 --> 01:31.753
And I was a one striper, so to speak.

01:32.574 --> 01:35.597
And in that sense, it sure helped a lot, you know.

01:40.061 --> 01:43.265
But other than that, I'm not sure, you know.

01:43.285 --> 01:43.505
All right.

01:43.585 --> 01:50.132
Summarize your war experience and then bring us back here to home.

01:50.232 --> 01:50.953
Okay.

01:51.338 --> 01:55.244
My first ship was an ammunition ship.

01:55.264 --> 02:00.231
And I went out to the South Pacific State out there for quite a long time, came back in.

02:00.271 --> 02:05.218
Then we took a second trip to Pearl Harbor.

02:06.740 --> 02:13.650
And while there, on the way back, I got orders to go to another ship that was under construction.

02:13.630 --> 02:16.595
And it was in Tampa, Florida.

02:17.436 --> 02:19.680
It was also an ammunition ship.

02:19.700 --> 02:20.942
So I got to Tampa, Florida.

02:22.084 --> 02:24.949
And in the meantime, it wasn't ready.

02:25.129 --> 02:35.487
So they sent me to Newport, Rhode Island to help get the crew together and all that sort of stuff.

02:35.467 --> 02:38.671
until they were sort of ready for us to come back down to Tampa.

02:39.471 --> 02:43.476
So we put that ship in commission in Tampa.

02:44.437 --> 02:47.300
And then that was the second ship.

02:48.481 --> 02:58.993
And we were out, we were past the Panama Canal, as a matter of fact, and got orders to go to the third ship.

03:00.374 --> 03:06.241
So I left that one and my third ship was also being completed in Key West.

03:07.782 --> 03:08.803
And it was a water ship.

03:09.444 --> 03:11.166
And it was a big old tanker.

03:12.007 --> 03:14.350
We made fresh water out of salt water.

03:15.771 --> 03:22.118
And the ships, you know, we made it specifically for those ships who didn't have enough for their own use.

03:23.079 --> 03:27.124
So we put that one into commission.

03:27.290 --> 03:35.985
Went to the Chesapeake Bay and around that area for the shakedown, then came back through the Panama Canal again, and then I went out to sea again for a pretty good while.

03:37.167 --> 03:43.999
And while there, I was the first lieutenant on that one, which had to do with

03:44.198 --> 03:47.805
It had to do with balance, among other things, keeping the ship balanced.

03:47.825 --> 03:50.209
If you know anything about water it's a tricky kind of a thing.

03:50.250 --> 03:56.682
Anyway, I had a lot of fun with that and spent some time there.

03:58.405 --> 04:06.240
And then, like I told you, then I had plenty of points to get out but they wouldn't let me out.

04:07.030 --> 04:12.238
The old man released me and I got assigned to the Yorktown, which is a big carrier.

04:13.140 --> 04:19.750
And I stayed there in the Pacific for a while and then came back to California and then finally home.

04:19.770 --> 04:26.620
Let's see, during the war, do you remember hearing about Franklin Roosevelt's death?

04:27.522 --> 04:30.827
Was that a, for me on the home front, that was a very...

04:31.988 --> 04:33.049
important day.

04:33.089 --> 04:41.618
Were there any other events that you remember exactly where you were, how you felt when you heard the news of a certain event?

04:43.881 --> 04:50.468
Well, one event I remember that we were in the South Pacific.

04:51.870 --> 04:56.815
Matter of fact, we were on the way to Manila, out there somewhere.

04:57.520 --> 05:03.451
when they announced that the Japanese had given in.

05:04.092 --> 05:04.693
I remember that.

05:06.396 --> 05:08.520
What was the reaction of you and your friends?

05:08.540 --> 05:10.744
Oh, man, we were all very happy, of course, you know, obviously.

05:11.184 --> 05:13.889
Was there celebrating on the ship?

05:14.731 --> 05:20.541
Well, other than just typically, yeah, everybody was happy and all that, but I don't remember any special thing took place.

05:22.462 --> 05:27.048
All right, and then, so you get out in early 46?

05:29.952 --> 05:32.876
Yep, I believe maybe December 46, I'm not sure.

05:33.296 --> 05:34.077
Oh, okay.

05:34.098 --> 05:35.299
Maybe, yeah.

05:35.439 --> 05:37.522
All right, and then... No, wait, hold it.

05:38.583 --> 05:43.931
I started here, school in February of 46.

05:44.171 --> 05:45.573
Okay, so you got out in December 45.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.515
I guess so, something like that, yeah.

05:48.056 --> 05:51.000
Did you think about going to graduate school anywhere else?

05:52.415 --> 05:53.176
Not really, no.

05:53.516 --> 05:58.402
So close to wife and family and home and all?

05:58.442 --> 05:59.344
That was the key factor.

06:00.004 --> 06:00.104
Yeah.

06:00.124 --> 06:00.385
All right.

06:00.425 --> 06:01.446
Being able to get out of the Navy.

06:01.867 --> 06:02.087
All right.

06:02.247 --> 06:09.916
And with the GI Bill, so for the first time as a student, you weren't quite as strapped financially.

06:10.357 --> 06:10.898
That's correct.

06:11.218 --> 06:11.979
Where did you all live?

06:12.980 --> 06:18.507
Well, we lived in an apartment first in Bryan and then

06:19.128 --> 06:20.089
Well that's where we lived.

06:21.251 --> 06:29.382
And while I was a student at A&M, as a graduate student, also was given an assistantship.

06:29.682 --> 06:32.426
So, man, we were living in a high on a hog.

06:33.187 --> 06:40.416
Ninety bucks a month from Uncle Sam, and at that time assistantships paid $67.50 a piece.

06:40.997 --> 06:45.002
So we had $157.50 and we lived well on that.

06:45.403 --> 06:48.527
My wife, incidentally, had continued to work some.

06:48.895 --> 06:50.097
No, she didn't either.

06:50.798 --> 06:52.922
So anyway, that was it.

06:52.942 --> 07:02.179
So what happened though when I was in graduate school here is that I had a guy whose name was Melvin Brooks.

07:02.219 --> 07:03.902
He was a professor in sociology.

07:05.145 --> 07:08.110
And we got along very well and he was a very bright guy.

07:08.190 --> 07:09.773
He was a Wisconsin man.

07:10.647 --> 07:14.370
And he wanted me to go to Wisconsin to do graduate work.

07:14.530 --> 07:18.934
I didn't know if I wanted to do further work or not, but anyway, I thought, well, maybe, anyway.

07:19.795 --> 07:22.758
So he had me to apply, and I got accepted in assistantship.

07:22.778 --> 07:33.828
So, well, in the meantime, while I was here, there was no, well, train service was the main thing to get here.

07:34.908 --> 07:40.013
And what happened was that a group of professors had come from Louisiana State on the train,

07:40.128 --> 07:55.133
And I got assigned to pick them up in my car and bring them to the campus to about a three-day big seminar or whatever they had and kind of be their gopher and got acquainted with them.

07:55.771 --> 08:01.598
One of the leading guys at that time had written a leading textbook in Rural Sociology.

08:02.419 --> 08:09.247
And we sort of got acquainted and he began to ask me about himself and I said well I grew up in this Czech community and all that sort of stuff.

08:09.667 --> 08:18.538
He said, and that was a big thing at that time at LSU, they had some mini-grants for studies for their students.

08:18.518 --> 08:41.016
they studied they did their dissertations they went like say to Argentina to Brazil of people who had moved from the United States to those countries in terms of adapting and all that and so he said to me he said young man do you realize that you you got a ready-made dissertation right there topic

08:41.266 --> 08:45.410
You know, you speak it, you know, you do this, you know, we're in that business.

08:46.110 --> 08:48.733
So I changed horses and went to LSU instead.

08:49.894 --> 08:50.675
And that's about it.

08:50.735 --> 08:52.136
When did you get over to LSU?

08:52.156 --> 08:53.117
Do you remember when?

08:53.137 --> 08:57.021
Yes, in the summer of 1947, I believe.

08:57.641 --> 08:59.263
So you had your master's done here?

08:59.283 --> 08:59.783
Yes, yes.

09:00.244 --> 09:01.265
And you go over there.

09:01.285 --> 09:02.005
Yeah.

09:02.025 --> 09:07.330
And by then, are you pretty well on course to be a faculty member?

09:07.891 --> 09:09.332
Had you thought you wanted to be a...

09:10.375 --> 09:11.518
Not really.

09:12.059 --> 09:12.761
I didn't know.

09:12.921 --> 09:14.846
I just thought that was the kind of thing to do.

09:15.828 --> 09:25.853
And while there I spent many hours studying, you know, working hard, in the meantime getting letters from

09:27.048 --> 09:35.943
You know, people tell me about all the success that my buddies were having at home, farming, and I kept saying to my wife, I just wonder if we shouldn't quit this stuff and go back to farming.

09:35.963 --> 09:39.849
Anyway, so we finished, and we finished at a good time.

09:40.510 --> 09:45.859
There were not many PhDs in my field, and there were lots of opportunities.

09:46.240 --> 09:52.650
And in those days, the good old boy system was under operation.

09:53.660 --> 10:00.508
number of schools that were looking for people, my folks recommended me to them.

10:01.709 --> 10:06.074
And I really had, I guess, some choice of where I wanted to go.

10:06.955 --> 10:15.685
So when the guys here at A&M wrote me and said, we would like to have you here if you'd like, et cetera,

10:15.985 --> 10:25.797
We talked about it, and Kitty says, well, you know me, I'd like to be at home, so that's how we ended up here.

10:27.018 --> 10:30.702
Now, when did you come back and join the faculty?

10:32.064 --> 10:33.866
1949 in September.

10:35.228 --> 10:38.131
And you had your dissertation, everything wrapped up?

10:38.151 --> 10:39.613
Yes, complete everything.

10:39.914 --> 10:41.777
That degree was in hand.

10:41.837 --> 10:45.883
I'd finished that summer in August of 49 and started in September.

10:47.044 --> 10:51.911
And we're not going to talk about money on any other question, but what was your starting salary?

10:52.152 --> 10:52.913
Okay.

10:52.933 --> 10:59.442
My starting salary was $4,500.

11:00.181 --> 11:04.848
for nine months, 500 a month.

11:05.890 --> 11:15.405
And it also, the telegram says there may be some opportunity to also get some summertime.

11:17.448 --> 11:27.403
And I might add that I came here and the sort of story behind that is that there was a special course

11:28.497 --> 11:52.620
called Rural Society 407, whatever it was, that the dean at that time, Shepardson, he had gotten a lot of complaints about people graduating from the College of Agriculture being very, very good in their chosen agricultural field, but not doing too well out there with the people that they were working with.

11:53.941 --> 11:56.884
So somebody, I don't know where, he got the idea.

11:57.168 --> 12:01.672
that it would be good if it had something dealing with people.

12:02.973 --> 12:13.822
So he decided to make it required of all ag majors that had to have a course in rural sociology.

12:14.183 --> 12:15.464
And there was this one course.

12:16.605 --> 12:18.286
And that was while I was at LSU.

12:18.426 --> 12:22.770
And some of the guys who were teaching there were not that good at it, what it was.

12:23.571 --> 12:25.993
So when I came here,

12:27.290 --> 12:32.198
He called me the very first day I was here at 8 o'clock on a Monday morning.

12:32.238 --> 12:36.224
He called me to his office and said that we were in the same building, the Ag building.

12:36.244 --> 12:47.482
He said, young man, I want you to know we brought you here because I've been having lots of problems from guys like, without naming anybody, the guys in agriculture.

12:48.643 --> 12:54.192
They resented the fact that they had to take this old, you know, something else outside their field, you know.

12:54.813 --> 12:59.219
And they said, lots of flack and I want you to know you're kind of under the gun here.

13:00.300 --> 13:04.846
So my first semester I taught five sections of that one course.

13:06.388 --> 13:09.151
The spring semester I taught five sections of the same course.

13:10.794 --> 13:13.237
And by then he was pretty happy with me.

13:14.679 --> 13:18.103
And then that summer I taught

13:18.472 --> 13:23.100
two sections of the same course, and there were two summer terms.

13:23.200 --> 13:27.047
I believe I taught 12 sections of the same course that first year.

13:27.627 --> 13:28.589
And what was it called?

13:28.769 --> 13:30.953
It was called Rural Sociology 407.

13:31.274 --> 13:32.776
But what was the title?

13:33.698 --> 13:37.264
I really think it was just called Rural Sociology, but I don't know.

13:37.785 --> 13:38.366
I think it was.

13:38.686 --> 13:41.251
And it was how to understand the people?

13:41.271 --> 13:42.052
Well, no, no.

13:42.453 --> 13:44.496
It basically was

13:45.809 --> 13:50.955
introductory sociology however applied to the, specifically to the rural scene.

13:52.377 --> 13:56.061
And of course you had grown up there.

13:58.123 --> 13:59.144
Yeah.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.468
And I was very fortunate in this story about him.

14:02.508 --> 14:08.235
He used to, my classroom was in room 105 on that floor where the dean was.

14:08.555 --> 14:10.297
The dean was down the hall.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.019
And I thought it was very interesting that

14:12.590 --> 14:17.395
Each time I was in that class, it seemed like he had, the bathroom was on the other end.

14:17.595 --> 14:19.578
He had to walk by and kind of look in.

14:20.999 --> 14:31.430
And I remember that somewhere along about the middle of my first semester, he called me and said, hey, you know, I just want you to know that you're doing pretty good, something like that.

14:32.391 --> 14:33.292
All right.

14:34.173 --> 14:36.596
What were your goals for that course?

14:36.736 --> 14:39.559
Tell them what your basic philosophy was.

14:40.130 --> 14:43.994
My basic philosophy was human behavior, you know.

14:46.016 --> 14:57.489
Basically, basic sociology really just to give them an idea of human behavior and how it operates and how people operate in groups and that sort of stuff.

14:57.509 --> 14:59.251
Just a plain old stuff.

15:00.172 --> 15:09.462
What were the general rules that you had for yourself and for the students in that course?

15:11.686 --> 15:17.714
Well, the general rules that I had from the very beginning was that they were something like this.

15:19.076 --> 15:27.007
I was going to seat you guys alphabetically to begin with, somehow.

15:27.027 --> 15:27.748
That's what I knew.

15:27.768 --> 15:30.893
And I was going to learn the names and all that.

15:31.754 --> 15:36.040
And I would know who was absent and all that sort of stuff.

15:37.471 --> 15:41.537
tell them that class attendance was important.

15:42.839 --> 15:57.599
And that while I would not deliberately fail someone because of that, I certainly, if there was ever any question about anything, if you're going to miss a bunch of class time, don't come to me with any problems.

15:57.940 --> 16:06.111
I sort of laid the rule down and pointed out to them that the class begins at this time and that kind of stuff.

16:07.238 --> 16:07.899
That was about it.

16:08.961 --> 16:10.064
Did you grade on the curve?

16:12.168 --> 16:13.571
No, not really.

16:13.951 --> 16:15.434
What kinds of tests did you give?

16:17.057 --> 16:24.212
Basically true-false, multiple choice, and then there was always a discussion question or two, what I'd call discussion.

16:24.713 --> 16:27.458
And about how many students per section?

16:28.062 --> 16:33.791
that first semester, the first year, 50 per section, because that's all the room would hold.

16:34.752 --> 16:43.526
So I had 250, 250, and oh, I don't know, maybe another 100 or so, well, maybe more.

16:43.546 --> 16:46.090
So I had a pretty good 6,700 students the first year.

16:46.591 --> 16:54.223
Now surely during those early years, you had some interesting anecdotes in working with those students.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.466
Can you share some of those experiences?

16:57.745 --> 17:10.517
Yeah, well, basically I'd say this, to begin with, they were excellent.

17:10.537 --> 17:12.339
They were really very, very good kids.

17:13.220 --> 17:14.501
And they really behaved well.

17:15.902 --> 17:20.827
I really can't recall, although I imagine it did happen, anybody going to sleep or anything like that.

17:21.387 --> 17:25.491
But on the other hand, I'm going to say it to you honestly, I just knocked myself out.

17:26.028 --> 17:38.382
trying to make it interesting and I was, there was always something in the newspaper or some news magazine like Newsweek or something that applied to something I was talking about.

17:38.983 --> 17:43.648
And I'd always bring these clippings to class and we'd talk about, you know, it was all part of it.

17:43.668 --> 17:46.291
It wasn't just strictly textbook stuff.

17:46.311 --> 17:55.562
Surely you must have had some interesting creative excuses that students would try to make for why they weren't there or why they didn't pass.

17:58.141 --> 18:06.072
I can't really, you know, it's really kind of, I can't remember anybody really ever trying to pull things.

18:06.293 --> 18:07.975
We were pretty stressed.

18:10.038 --> 18:23.076
I think they had the impression that I was there for business and that I was going to do my part and I expected to do their part and I didn't get flack from people or anything like that.

18:23.918 --> 18:27.102
And they were not, they were always very obedient.

18:28.027 --> 18:30.210
I don't remember anybody challenging me.

18:30.230 --> 18:34.257
You don't like to say, hey, you know, prof, you didn't, you know.

18:35.098 --> 18:37.361
They were just nice kids, just nice kids.

18:37.702 --> 18:43.551
In those early days, as a faculty member, describe a typical work day for you.

18:43.571 --> 18:44.933
What time did you get there?

18:45.274 --> 18:46.876
What did you spend the day doing?

18:47.297 --> 18:47.617
Where?

18:47.818 --> 18:49.260
Okay.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.884
First, I would always leave the house probably around 7 o'clock.

18:52.505 --> 18:53.506
I had an 8 o'clock class.

18:54.047 --> 18:55.890
In those days, the classrooms were locked.

18:57.170 --> 19:04.236
And I would get there, and I would go up the, and it just took a few minutes to get there.

19:05.137 --> 19:11.983
And I would look at my class notes every time before I went to class and say, this is what I'm going to try to cover today, and so on.

19:12.844 --> 19:16.647
And then about 10 minutes before, I would go down and unlock the classroom.

19:18.208 --> 19:22.052
And they would all go in, and 10 o'clock sharp, I went in.

19:23.493 --> 19:25.675
And we started.

19:26.161 --> 19:37.557
I always made it for sure to be through at 50 minutes after I started and all that.

19:38.158 --> 19:42.304
But I can't recall any real unusual kind of a thing.

19:42.364 --> 19:43.126
What about lunch?

19:43.206 --> 19:53.260
Where was... Oh, typically I took my own lunch and ate it in the office.

19:53.741 --> 19:55.223
By yourself or with some buddies?

19:56.772 --> 19:59.574
Mostly by myself, I guess.

20:00.435 --> 20:08.542
Or sometimes Brooks would bring his lunch, he was still here, he'd bring his lunch and a couple of others would come in, but you know, basically.

20:09.183 --> 20:17.430
And I really spent most of my lunchtime, I think, eating a sandwich and looking at my notes for the next time and that sort of thing.

20:17.590 --> 20:20.993
All right, and then the afternoons, what?

20:21.013 --> 20:26.458
Well, okay, in the first place I had five sections.

20:27.603 --> 20:40.416
Three presentations, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and by the way in those days we had a Saturday also, and two I guess on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday I guess.

20:40.777 --> 20:46.583
And I almost never went anywhere to run around anything like that.

20:46.603 --> 20:51.568
I spent my time there working on the next day's presentations.

20:51.608 --> 20:52.769
What time would you head home?

20:52.789 --> 20:55.652
A little bit after five.

20:56.189 --> 20:57.711
And by the way, there's another thing.

20:58.692 --> 21:04.199
The dean at that time was, he was, he really kept close track of people.

21:04.459 --> 21:13.990
He kind of knew when people were in place and not, and I was, I was one that he could count on being there after it was over.

21:14.190 --> 21:18.596
Now, this was the Department of Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology?

21:18.616 --> 21:20.218
And Rural Sociology, that's correct.

21:20.238 --> 21:24.002
All right, who were some of your key colleagues those early years?

21:25.585 --> 21:26.987
the early years L.P.

21:27.027 --> 21:28.429
Gabbard was the head of the department.

21:28.469 --> 21:30.451
He was an economist, okay.

21:31.633 --> 21:45.671
Now my rural sociology group were Dan R. Davis, Cigar Davis, and Melvin Brooks, who was my major professor at the graduate level there.

21:47.233 --> 21:49.416
And also, by the way, at that time

21:51.016 --> 21:54.501
We encompassed more than just rural sociology.

21:54.962 --> 21:58.867
Of course Dan Russell was also sort of the chairman of our group.

22:00.069 --> 22:09.141
And we actually offered, we were the only ones to offer what we would call journalism.

22:09.382 --> 22:11.365
There was no separate journalism there.

22:11.385 --> 22:14.509
And a guy by the name of Otis Miller.

22:15.721 --> 22:20.567
taught journalism, but he was not in sociology.

22:20.587 --> 22:22.349
Well, he was in our department.

22:23.831 --> 22:26.835
And let's see, what else?

22:29.698 --> 22:39.150
And there were a few others here and there, some of which just stayed a year and left and that kind of thing, but those were the key pieces.

22:39.790 --> 22:43.635
How many of those people in rural sociology had their PhD?

22:46.872 --> 22:48.976
Melvin Brooks and I were the only two.

22:51.521 --> 22:56.270
And were you well accepted as a beginning faculty member?

22:57.052 --> 22:57.552
I think so.

22:57.973 --> 22:59.937
I think I was really

23:01.402 --> 23:02.243
fully accepted.

23:03.065 --> 23:04.447
And they welcomed me with an open arm.

23:04.647 --> 23:07.992
It was a very, very congenial, very nice group of people.

23:08.653 --> 23:10.256
They never had any problem with anybody.

23:10.276 --> 23:11.798
It was just a great bunch.

23:11.818 --> 23:17.046
And did you, were you able to get summer assignment early on?

23:17.967 --> 23:18.308
Okay.

23:18.448 --> 23:26.160
Look, the first summer I taught, the first semester I believe it was, okay.

23:26.663 --> 23:33.510
And there was a guy, there were some guys, ag economists, who had a field research project.

23:33.530 --> 23:34.671
It was a big project.

23:35.753 --> 23:41.158
And they hired me to do interviewing with them, mainly in Bell County.

23:41.999 --> 23:43.981
And so I did that the second six weeks.

23:44.001 --> 23:45.263
So I had a good year.

23:46.224 --> 23:55.253
And then also what had happened is that the, how was this now?

23:57.427 --> 23:59.030
And that worked out well.

23:59.371 --> 24:07.887
And I think that Mr. Gabbard, and by the way, even though Russell was chairman of our group, he had very little say-so about it really.

24:08.428 --> 24:10.572
Gabbard made the decisions.

24:11.334 --> 24:18.287
And I think he, somebody approached the people at the experiment station.

24:19.533 --> 24:24.798
about the fact that at many land-grant colleges they had rural sociologists doing research.

24:26.119 --> 24:39.532
And so I think after I was there probably the first year I then got a part-time appointment with the experiment station.

24:39.552 --> 24:49.101
But I was the only rural sociologist attached, of course, to my regular department.

24:49.081 --> 24:49.782
Yeah.

24:49.802 --> 24:51.123
What was your research topic?

24:51.403 --> 24:51.723
Okay.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.367
In the first place let me say this.

24:57.229 --> 25:17.788
When I first started out, I want, back up, the experimentation, well, on the campus in general at that time, this is in 1949-50, a lot of people thought of sociology, anybody who had the title sociology,

25:17.903 --> 25:24.131
was kind of a wild-haired kind of a, you know, non-conformist, you know, all that sort of stuff, really.

25:25.593 --> 25:31.521
And so I decided that whatever I was going to do, I was going to be on the safe side.

25:31.561 --> 25:35.787
I would not try to do anything that might cause anybody to raise their hackles.

25:37.449 --> 25:46.341
And so there was a new law passed in Texas called the Gilmer-Akin Laws that had to do with

25:46.405 --> 25:50.096
consolidating schools and all that sort of stuff.

25:50.116 --> 25:55.673
So I thought, well, this would be a good place I could start, I could do a study of

25:56.345 --> 26:00.392
of what happened under the Gilmer-Akin laws, to what degree.

26:00.432 --> 26:13.875
The best I could tell, this was working, what was happening to the kids, how much time they spent on school buses, all that sort of stuff.

26:13.895 --> 26:16.259
So I wrote a research proposal.

26:18.182 --> 26:21.508
And at that time, the director of the Experimental Station was the government of Patterson.

26:22.670 --> 26:25.974
And I had my pipelines to find out what was going on.

26:26.895 --> 26:28.477
And I got no action for a while.

26:28.957 --> 26:33.082
As a matter of fact, you know, didn't get word back it was approved, I was on the payroll.

26:35.985 --> 26:50.922
But I found out from others at that level that Patterson was rather wondering if I wasn't one of these wild haired guys, and if I was going to do this, if that really wasn't going to stir up a lot of problems.

26:52.100 --> 26:57.330
And by the way, and so it didn't get approved for a while.

26:57.550 --> 27:14.142
But anyway, by the time that the second year there was over nine months, it had gotten approved, so I spent the summer then working on that project.

27:15.472 --> 27:19.398
research piece on it, you know, bulletin.

27:19.578 --> 27:20.479
Matter of fact, it was called.

27:21.561 --> 27:26.869
And I was told he was very, very happy that this guy really didn't stir up a bunch of problems.

27:26.889 --> 27:29.492
And so from that point, it was pretty much.

27:29.853 --> 27:35.421
Basically, what did you discover in that research?

27:35.975 --> 28:03.788
I really don't recall the final things, but stuff like to what degree did the kids who had to ride the school buses very long distances, to what degree this seemed to affect their performances and things like that, and kinds of things like that.

28:05.337 --> 28:11.147
I forget now, but there were a number of counties in which we did this, and I went to the schools.

28:11.167 --> 28:22.165
Like there was an elected school superintendent, for example, and talked about the information with that person, and actually they had in the background about what was happening and all that sort of stuff.

28:22.145 --> 28:22.986
I don't recall.

28:23.026 --> 28:27.373
I wish I'd have kept a copy of that first publication like that.

28:27.954 --> 28:30.377
Then after that, that came out all right.

28:30.457 --> 28:33.362
So I think the next thing I did, I sort of lucked out.

28:34.123 --> 28:49.867
In the meantime, the people in the USDA that I'd gotten acquainted with through other reigns, I got a really, and for those days, a pretty good, no wait a minute, that was about 1960 I guess.

28:49.927 --> 28:50.768
I don't know.

28:51.980 --> 28:57.086
At LSU one of the main things that I got exposed to was demography.

28:58.488 --> 29:06.718
So I got interested in that and I began then to teach a course in that area, an undergraduate course, and that went over very well.

29:07.880 --> 29:17.852
And so I began to do publications for the experiment station about what is happening in Texas demographically.

29:18.423 --> 29:25.473
and even did a study of some counties specifically and tried to write about how this might influence things in the future, all that sort of stuff.

29:26.194 --> 29:27.716
So I sort of got into that.

29:28.898 --> 29:40.755
Then about 1960, I guess it was, somewhere in maybe 58, I got a really big research grant from USDA in Washington, D.C.

29:41.917 --> 29:46.303
And what they wanted to know at that time was

29:48.798 --> 29:54.414
Almost everybody was covered under Social Security, except farmers were not.

29:55.597 --> 30:03.600
And so what they wanted was a study of farmers per se who were sort of approaching retirement age

30:04.492 --> 30:07.336
and how they were doing.

30:07.716 --> 30:15.186
Did they really have enough resources to retire on by themselves without all that sort of stuff.

30:15.207 --> 30:18.711
So I worked with the people in Washington D.C.

30:18.771 --> 30:19.232
on that one.

30:20.153 --> 30:30.347
And we selected about, they selected for me really about four counties I believe it was in which we did the study per se to try to get at these questions.

30:30.327 --> 30:47.555
not to draw my conclusion as to whether or not they should be extended Social Security or not, or whether they should be covered by it, or whether, but just simply what was happening to these people in retirement and that sort of stuff.

30:48.457 --> 30:57.111
And supposedly we and Kentucky and Connecticut I believe and somebody else were the states chosen for that.

30:57.378 --> 31:06.130
And supposedly they used this in Congress to sort of, in the argument about whether or not to extend Social Security to farmers.

31:07.272 --> 31:12.399
And so that was one, that was a big project that Nixon and I had.

31:13.441 --> 31:17.366
And then from that point on it was, and that went over very well.

31:17.386 --> 31:20.871
And I guess from that point on.
