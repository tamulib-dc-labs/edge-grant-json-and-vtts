WEBVTT

00:03.592 --> 00:10.620
When

00:03.592 --> 00:10.620
he was reading, was it okay for his daughter to 
interrupt him? Sure.

00:16.566 --> 00:22.993
He never did cause me any kind of problems, any kind 
of discipline. It was my mother. Now, what were

00:24.715 --> 00:28.519
your mother's rules for you? Well, just normal, 
normal behavior.

00:36.795 --> 00:38.037
But my father never did. What did she do for 
relaxation? Did she have some clubs? Yeah, she

00:42.302 --> 00:44.044
bombed some clubs. What were they? Well, they were 
ladies' social clubs, mainly. Was it named the

00:50.673 --> 00:52.655
social club then? No, let's see. I've got to get my 
schools connected. Because the ones I can

00:58.081 --> 01:01.606
remember now are mostly OU. See, that's been since 
1925 that she's been, that she was down in OU, so I

01:01.726 --> 01:12.000
don't remember the ones way back. Did she, did she 
have a group of women that came every, did they meet

01:12.921 --> 01:21.793
weekly or monthly? Well, if she belonged to one, it 
would be just monthly or something like that, I

01:23.005 --> 01:30.485
suppose. I don't really know about that. Did you 
all go to church off campus? Mm-hmm. Where? We

01:38.598 --> 01:40.981
always went to church. And they supported both 
churches. I said one was a Methodist and one was a

01:45.686 --> 01:49.110
Baptist. And we'd go to first one church and then 
the other church. And they, as I said, supported

01:52.414 --> 01:55.518
both of them. And I never did understand why they 
didn't combine them. Then did they decide which

02:00.123 --> 02:03.627
church you would attend? Well, I just went with 
them. You went to both? I just went with them.

02:07.686 --> 02:09.148
Wherever they went, I went. So I'm asking you, 
about to ask a leading question. So did you grow up

02:13.874 --> 02:16.557
and become a Baptist or a Methodist? I came up and 
joined my... The Sunday that I got back from my

02:19.420 --> 02:28.351
honeymoon, I went down and joined my husband's 
church, First Christian Church. First

02:28.391 --> 02:29.853
Christian, the disciples. Yeah. Did you see the 
church up here, the... One looks like a beehive.

02:35.034 --> 02:37.177
Well, that's our first Christian church. Oh, 
okay. And you should have heard my husband after he

02:38.620 --> 02:41.825
saw those plans. The minister called him and asked 
him to come by and look at the plans when he came

02:43.388 --> 02:49.358
home. He said, you wouldn't believe what I've just 
seen. Oh, he was so put out and so mad about this.

02:59.573 --> 03:01.395
Beehive, as he called it. But it's really a very 
fine plant. And they've got a theater room, a

03:03.759 --> 03:06.943
building. And it's fine. In your days at A&M, was 
there an organized Baptist church And Methodist

03:17.958 --> 03:20.802
Church next to the campus? No, but I noticed in this 
annual,

03:21.523 --> 03:36.504
in the organizations, it would be the Baptist 
group and the Methodist group of students. They

03:37.826 --> 03:43.213
were organized on the campus, and I had forgotten 
about that. Let's see, back to student life. Where

03:46.375 --> 03:52.487
did the Aggie men get those beautiful boots in 
those days? I don't know, but sure I had them. They

03:55.132 --> 03:57.216
kept them polished. Later there would be a couple 
of boot makers just across the north side of the

03:57.236 --> 04:06.032
campus. They were not there then? I don't know. 
Were Aggie rings kind of sacred at that time? Yeah,

04:12.371 --> 04:13.973
I guess they were. I don't know about that.

04:20.642 --> 04:21.063
Let's see. Do you remember your dad ever

04:22.525 --> 04:30.416
complaining about the board of directors? Did the 
board of directors try to sometimes interfere too

04:30.496 --> 04:34.101
much? I don't remember whether they did or not. 
He's not a politician in any sense of the word. And

04:46.757 --> 04:57.166
when he got up here, he had some legislative 
problems getting his library building and some

04:46.757 --> 04:57.166
other things. But I don't remember. And ask in 
there about anybody that I remember. And anybody I

05:05.890 --> 05:11.819
remember is mostly just by name now because it's 
been too long. I can't remember. And I know that one

05:13.682 --> 05:21.894
of the members of the board of directors when we 
were down there was Mr. F.M. Law. Does that name

05:22.815 --> 05:24.197
mean anything? Yes, ma'am. Law Hall is a cherished 
building on the campus. How did... How did your

05:33.363 --> 05:36.768
father and Mr. Lowell become acquainted? Do you 
remember? Well, I guess it was because he was, I

05:37.770 --> 05:43.859
don't know whether he was president of the board. 
At one time he was. Well, that's what I was

05:45.782 --> 05:54.896
thinking, but I was just assuming that because his 
name comes to my mind more than any of the rest of

05:45.782 --> 05:54.896
them. Do you remember any of the governors during 
that period? What about Governor Ferguson? Sure.

06:03.889 --> 06:07.013
I just remember Ma Ferguson. I was wondering, did 
you meet Ma? I don't remember that I ever did meet

06:09.095 --> 06:11.338
her. Because I would like to know more about her. 
She's apparently a very distinctive lady. Did

06:18.467 --> 06:22.111
your dad spend much time going to and from Austin? I 
don't remember about that either. Probably had to

06:26.376 --> 06:29.540
go over there some. But do you ever... I'll run into 
the name Ike Ashburn. Yes, ma'am. Well, he was a

06:38.032 --> 06:48.363
real loved person on the campus in those years, and 
very popular. He was a commandant of the Corps in

06:48.383 --> 06:53.048
this book right here. And it had a very 
complimentary letter from from somebody about

06:59.628 --> 07:05.334
the way the student body had been trained.

07:09.398 --> 07:12.061
Do you describe Colonel Ashburn? He was a big man, 
great big man, fine looking man. Pleasant? Very

07:17.626 --> 07:18.527
pleasant.

07:21.250 --> 07:29.398
He married my mother's cousin from Navasota, Bula 
Cook.

07:31.015 --> 07:34.158
They had a son, Ike Junior. And then when they had a 
child later, she and the baby died during

07:35.700 --> 07:41.907
childbirth. So that was a blow to everybody that 
knew Ike Ashburn. Did Mr. Cashin get there before

07:48.334 --> 07:53.820
you all left to direct the YMCA? I don't believe so. 
DX Bible. Oh, my father brought him down. How did

08:02.268 --> 08:05.291
they link up? Do you know? I don't know, but he was a 
very favorite. The D.X. Bible was just a... What

08:12.620 --> 08:17.025
made him their favorite? I don't know. Because he 
was at Mississippi College before coming to A&M.

08:23.312 --> 08:23.492
Yeah. And then he brought with him a young man named 
Anderson. I don't remember him. who would be

08:30.213 --> 08:33.217
nicknamed Andy. And he would become the great, 
great, great track coach and also the Commandant

08:34.298 --> 08:40.907
of the Corps. Do you remember a football player 
named Hiney Weir? The name, you know, that's a very

08:47.835 --> 08:50.619
familiar name. Do you remember anything more? No. 
I can't remember. The reason I'm is because he is

08:57.837 --> 09:09.892
the football player who has the knee injury in the 
Texas game before they go to Dallas to play a

08:57.837 --> 09:09.892
postseason game in the Cotton Classic. Oh, yeah. 
And Coach Bible turns to young Ashburn, a young

09:11.935 --> 09:27.574
Anderson, and says, remember four years ago when 
we were at Mississippi College, we were playing

09:11.935 --> 09:27.574
Mississippi State, and for the first time in 
history we were ahead of them But a bunch of our guys

09:28.111 --> 09:34.579
got hurt, and we didn't have enough players to have 
11 men on the field all the time. So you go up there in

09:35.260 --> 09:51.621
the bleachers and get King Gill, who is Hiney 
Weir's substitute, and he's here as a spectator,

09:35.260 --> 09:51.621
tell him to go put his uniform on because if we need 
him, We'll want him to play today. And that's where

09:54.412 --> 09:58.620
the 12th man legend got started. And that's why I 
was wondering if you knew, remembered Honey Weir.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.815
I certainly remember the name. Coach Bible, 
describe him as you recall him. Well, a very fine

10:12.745 --> 10:16.511
personality. Everybody liked him, so far as I 
know. I think he was very popular and a wonderful

10:20.217 --> 10:25.105
coach and everything. I don't know of anything 
other than good things I could say about him. Did

10:29.612 --> 10:31.295
athletes go to class then? I

10:31.315 --> 10:39.208
suppose so.

10:39.982 --> 10:43.105
Well, did students all go to class then? Do you 
remember students playing around when classes

10:45.207 --> 10:49.211
were in session? No. I probably didn't know much 
about that. When you were in class, did students go

10:54.676 --> 10:59.381
to sleep much in class?

11:03.605 --> 11:06.208
I don't recall that they did. Probably did.

11:10.390 --> 11:16.777
Well, let's see, you said no fires and tornadoes 
and train wrecks. We have had tornadoes, but we've

11:18.139 --> 11:23.144
been fortunate right here. We had one in Nichols 
Hills just this spring. And I remember reading

11:27.048 --> 11:29.651
about that one. Yeah, but the big one, you know, was 
just in May. That's when we had our big to tore down

11:36.378 --> 11:40.905
everybody's houses in that very big area. Compare 
being a student at A&M to being a student at the

11:41.846 --> 11:47.514
University of Texas. It was more fun being a 
student at A&M, I can say. Describe what made it

11:54.344 --> 11:56.547
more fun. Well, I was just so much more gung-ho 
about A&M than I was Texas University. And that is a

12:04.336 --> 12:11.344
shame to say, because I'm really proud of my degree 
from Texas University.

12:13.887 --> 12:24.120
But it was just the nature of things for me to feel 
like I did about A&M.

12:24.674 --> 12:32.024
The conduct of the two student bodies, was there 
any difference?

12:32.124 --> 12:45.703
Well, it was totally different, not having any 
military, but the ones I was associated with were

12:32.124 --> 12:45.703
just very normal, very nice people. Were Aggies 
more respectful to young ladies than Longhorns

12:47.125 --> 12:53.955
were? I don't know that they were. I had some 
things. I don't know whether you care about it.

13:10.101 --> 13:13.924
Did you show him the picture? Well, when you were 
talking about World War I, I just handed it to him.

13:16.747 --> 13:17.207
Yes, ma'am. Oh, did you see this? Yes, ma'am. Oh, 
that's a special card. Special card. Your family

13:24.918 --> 13:28.984
had a telephone always when you all... Mm-hmm. My 
phone number was 65. 65. Mm-hmm. Where was the

13:33.291 --> 13:35.775
telegraph office? Oh, I don't know about that. Was 
there even one at College Station? Oh, I imagine. I

13:43.466 --> 13:43.887
don't know. Do you remember where the students 
could have used a telephone? Because there

13:48.073 --> 13:49.896
wouldn't have been one in each room. No, no. I don't 
have any idea about that. Let's see, typewriter.

13:58.300 --> 14:01.044
Was a typewriter available to you at home? I never 
did learn to write on one. I never yet learned to

14:04.008 --> 14:09.576
write on one. You said your father called you when 
he was called to take the job at OU. How did he and the

14:17.807 --> 14:23.635
University of Oklahoma become linked? Do you 
know? No, I don't know that. The Board of Regents, I

14:29.567 --> 14:42.463
guess, just... Because as far as I know, his work at 
A&M was very, very, very positive, and everybody

14:29.567 --> 14:42.463
was deeply proud to have him. Well, I think it was, 
you know, it was kind of a hard decision. Anytime

14:49.832 --> 14:52.215
you're going to make a change like that. But he... 
Had many good years at OU, too. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

15:01.331 --> 15:01.752
Let's see. Another name of a person. Do you 
remember a man who had been an A&M director, later

15:04.996 --> 15:14.489
they'd call regent, from Houston named E.H. 
Cushing? Mm-hmm. That name's familiar, Cushing.

15:18.033 --> 15:19.175
Do you remember anything? But I don't know 
anything about him. Well, when the old main

15:20.737 --> 15:24.582
building burned and the first dining hall 
burned... A&M was bankrupt, and he wrote a check, a

15:25.338 --> 15:37.818
personal check, to keep the institution going 
until the legislature could meet in regular

15:25.338 --> 15:37.818
session and appropriate money. And a previous A&M 
president named David Franklin Houston, or

15:38.840 --> 15:51.700
Houston, it's sometimes pronounced both ways, 
who later was also the UT president and who later

15:38.840 --> 15:51.700
was in President Wilson's cabinet, he tried to 
persuade the legislature to close A&M down and

15:52.186 --> 15:59.818
move everything to Austin and merge it into the 
University of Texas. And Mr. Cushing saved A&M.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.671
Let's see, was there a bonfire at A&M in those days? 
Oh, sure. And you know, every year to this day, on

16:08.332 --> 16:18.649
certain night, my son from Enid calls me Mom, 
tonight is the night of the bonfire, and it's going

16:19.777 --> 16:27.208
to be on television, and I turn it on and watch it 
every time. Where was the bonfire held in those

16:28.710 --> 16:32.215
days? I don't know what part of the campus it was on, 
but it was a big thing, and afterwards the whole

16:32.235 --> 16:42.230
student body came over to our house and got around 
the front porch. What did they put in the bonfire?

16:44.026 --> 16:49.976
everything, I guess, boxes, and now, goodness, I 
don't know what they do. Now it's logs only. Is that

16:51.658 --> 16:52.360
right? But then, and what did, in those days, did 
they have anything they put on top of it? Not that I

16:58.009 --> 16:59.111
remember. Because a few years later, they would 
borrow someone's privy,

16:59.351 --> 17:11.130
paint it orange, and put it up there, and then... 
they would raise the money to go to the family from

17:11.482 --> 17:19.794
which the privy had been stolen and pay for a new 
outhouse. That's the old lag of spirit.

17:24.420 --> 17:24.801
There you go. There you go. Let's see. For you as a 
student, a full-time student, did you feel any

17:30.068 --> 17:40.122
pressure, personal pressure to... be sure that 
you made your grades, that you behaved in a special

17:40.726 --> 17:46.972
way? No. You didn't? No. I was not aware of it. Do you 
remember any students getting into trouble? If

17:58.864 --> 18:01.947
so, what kind of punishment did they get from A&M 
then? If it was bad enough, they got expelled, but I

18:04.190 --> 18:09.535
don't know. Some kind of military thing, I 
suppose. Now, as I looked at the photographs of

18:15.118 --> 18:23.189
your father, it looked like that quite often he had 
on a white suit. Did he sometimes wear? Oh, in the

18:26.433 --> 18:32.240
summer, I don't remember having a white suit much. 
Back in those days, maybe he did. I don't remember.

18:36.966 --> 18:38.188
Oh, where was his office? What building? I assumed 
it was in the administration building. And did you

18:46.466 --> 18:49.271
sometimes go over there? Not much that I remember. 
Did he have a secretary that was a special staff

18:53.699 --> 18:59.029
member for a long time? I'm the only one I can think 
of that was one that owe you for all those years. I

19:07.929 --> 19:14.182
don't, I just don't, oh let's see, I believe his 
name was Bailey. Who? S.G. Bailey. S.G. Bailey.

19:17.769 --> 19:19.713
That name kind of comes to me. I've heard of that 
name. Well, I told the children, and this is maybe

19:22.043 --> 19:31.857
getting off that subject, but I told the children 
that I was going to tell you about how I caught my

19:22.043 --> 19:31.857
husband. Sure. Yes. Sure. Well, we had gotten to 
Norman. I had to cross over to Norman just a little

19:38.266 --> 19:41.270
bit. And my husband, I guess Daddy was... First 
year law. Did I have two years of law school after

19:52.535 --> 19:55.460
that? 1925, he would have been probably a second 
year law student. I thought he was president of the

20:01.308 --> 20:02.850
student council. Well, he was. He was. But he, I 
think, I was thinking maybe two years anyway, he

20:04.953 --> 20:15.068
had gotten his same degree in 25 that I had. but and 
he was in first year of law but he was also president

20:16.330 --> 20:42.760
of the student body so he worked closely with my 
father you know on student affairs and things and

20:16.330 --> 20:42.760
he just thought that since they kind of had a liking 
for each other they admired each other that it

20:16.330 --> 20:42.760
would be nice if he would make a date with his 
daughter, just pure courtesy date, not because he

20:43.195 --> 20:50.928
wanted to. So he called and asked me to go to a 
baseball game with him. And I said I was delighted

20:55.075 --> 20:58.200
to go with him. And so we went to the game and enjoyed 
the game. And when the game was over, he looked

21:02.547 --> 21:07.195
around at me He said, you are the first girl I've 
ever taken to a sporting event that would stay

21:07.681 --> 21:16.710
during the whole game. And I said, at A&M, we don't 
do that. We stay at the whole till the game is over.

21:28.761 --> 21:34.667
And he was so impressed with that, I said, that's 
how I caught my husband. So you're saying that it

21:34.816 --> 21:37.178
was the Aggie spirit? It was the Aggie spirit that 
kept me at that ball

21:37.438 --> 21:44.525
game. All right, that reminds me to ask, describe 
going to an A&M football game. Oh, that was always a

21:52.792 --> 21:57.917
great event. We had so many good football teams. 
Was it called Kyle Field then? Uh-huh, yeah. When

22:03.976 --> 22:09.205
they built that stadium it was Kyle Field. What did 
you and your friends do at a football game? Just

22:15.397 --> 22:18.202
what everybody else did. Just yell and of course 
the students all kind of stayed together. Did you

22:24.293 --> 22:26.136
stand up the whole game? We didn't do that then. 
That's what they do now, but they didn't do that

22:29.000 --> 22:32.625
back in those days. Did the Aggies kiss their dates 
after a touchdown? Probably. I don't remember

22:37.992 --> 22:40.054
that. Because that's a strong tradition now. That 
is, yeah. And was there a formal march-in

22:44.500 --> 22:47.724
ceremony? Well, at the half, they always had the 
whole student body come down and make a big T right

22:48.445 --> 22:55.414
down the middle of it. Did you, as a coed, did you go 
down with them ever? No, no. Only? No girls. No

23:03.076 --> 23:03.496
girls? No girls down there. And you know, I've been 
real excited about our band. It's now up to 405

23:13.619 --> 23:16.244
members. Well, it is a wonderful man. It really is. 
And as I said, the children have always kind of

23:19.669 --> 23:26.381
teased me about the way I make on, so about A&M. And 
one of the games that they had down at OU, I started

23:26.441 --> 23:35.577
to say this about my son and Enid Lee Jr., was in the 
press box. And at the half, of course they bring in

23:38.754 --> 23:55.897
all these other sports now, but at the football 
game, our band, the A&M band, was there and

23:38.754 --> 23:55.897
performed down the, you know, that precision 
marching, and the music was, you know, how it is.

23:57.138 --> 23:59.742
And he called me from the press box. And he said, I 
will have to admit that that is the finest band I

24:00.683 --> 24:09.452
think I have ever seen or something like that. He 
said that A&M band is spectacular. And he, from the

24:12.596 --> 24:18.722
press box, called me to tell him. So I've been very 
proud of that because it is, I just think, a superb

24:18.742 --> 24:23.527
band. Did you go to basketball and baseball games? 
Oh, yeah. And where were the baseballs? Do you

24:30.469 --> 24:31.790
remember where they were played? It's too far back 
for me to remember that. I never have been as much of

24:36.135 --> 24:42.541
a baseball fan as I have basketball and football, 
mainly football. But I always went to them when we

24:43.382 --> 24:47.426
were down there. Was silver taps a tradition then? 
When a student died, a special ceremony to to

24:56.489 --> 24:59.634
commemorate that student's death. Silver taps, I 
don't recall that. Today, just west of the

25:03.579 --> 25:12.853
academic building, is the statue of Lawrence 
Sullivan Ross. Sol Ross, yeah. And then the

25:14.916 --> 25:26.192
buglers from the band come out on the second floor 
of the building, and the students gather in

25:14.916 --> 25:26.192
silence, all the student body around that, and 
there is a ceremony, and then they play taps, and

25:26.881 --> 25:49.021
you are then to go back to your room in total silence 
and not supposed to turn on your lights unless you

25:26.881 --> 25:49.021
really have to study, and if so, close the blinds 
and close your door to silently try to remember

25:26.881 --> 25:49.021
your friendship for that student that is gone. 
Well, for goodness sakes, isn't that

25:49.041 --> 25:51.285
interesting? Let's see, celebrity visitors. Do 
you remember any famous people coming to visit?

25:58.533 --> 26:03.799
Oh, I'm sure there were plenty of them, but I don't, 
I just can't remember those. I don't think, I don't

26:03.819 --> 26:09.865
know of President Woodrow Wilson coming or 
McKendree. I don't believe so, and I don't

26:09.966 --> 26:14.070
remember that. Let me see, I was going to... Oh, Sol 
Ross, when you said Sol Ross, in the old campus that

26:17.675 --> 26:30.375
I'm, that's all that I knew about, and had a statue 
of him. Yes, ma'am. Is that statue still there? Oh,

26:33.561 --> 26:34.141
yes. Still there? Every freshman is supposed to 
polish it at least once. Well, but when I was down

26:38.026 --> 26:48.621
there, if it rained, some freshman had to hold an 
umbrella over his head the

26:38.026 --> 26:48.621
whole time. I mean, you said, Saul Ross, that's the 
first thing I ever think of.

26:56.292 --> 26:56.893
That's great. Let's see. How much did things cost? 
Do you remember the prices of things? A dress? Not

27:08.890 --> 27:11.873
like it does now, but I don't know. What about that 
haircut that you got in Houston? Do you remember

27:15.497 --> 27:17.659
what your mother paid that beautician? No. I just 
know she turned down the $25.

27:25.328 --> 27:31.995
While you were living in College Station, did you 
and your family make any vacation trips that you

27:25.328 --> 27:31.995
recall? But most of the time, our vacation was 
going to either Chicago to the University of

27:32.735 --> 27:42.329
Chicago. My father was taking classes to get a 
degree there. And then we went for several summers

27:47.617 --> 27:54.868
to New York with him while he was going to Columbia. 
So those were our vacation trips like that. Now,

27:58.153 --> 28:00.796
did he get a degree while he was at A&M? Did he 
complete? A degree at one of those schools? No,

28:04.539 --> 28:07.182
he'd gotten his degree at Baylor. And then the next 
was, I guess it was, what was his law degree at the

28:08.023 --> 28:15.632
University of Chicago? He got one graduate degree 
at the University of Chicago and one at Columbia,

28:15.692 --> 28:22.260
but I don't know which one was which. Ph.D. was from 
Columbia, I think. Ph.D. was from Columbia. In

28:26.164 --> 28:27.986
what specialty? Sociology, wasn't it? Well, that 
was his field, but. I'm not sure that I ever saw

28:32.624 --> 28:36.548
that. And he was chosen. I've got a little medal 
upstairs. He was chosen outstanding graduate one

28:40.412 --> 28:49.822
year.

28:51.443 --> 29:00.032
If I could chat with your father today, what do you 
think he would remember most fondly about A&M? But

29:01.092 --> 29:10.386
I think he would have a lot of the same spirit 
himself, because I think they really enjoyed the

29:01.092 --> 29:10.386
years down there. Was it easy to move away, for you, 
to move from College Station? Well, fortunately

29:18.118 --> 29:20.682
it was in the summertime. And I graduated that 
spring, and then we came right up to Norman. And did

29:31.467 --> 29:36.332
you meet, and you met that young man the next 
spring, that special? That was, well, that was

29:36.372 --> 29:40.255
just, that fall I met him. Oh, that fall, oh. Yeah. 
That's very good, good timing for him.

29:52.467 --> 29:55.310
Let's see, we're getting near the completion.

29:58.232 --> 29:59.854
What effects did? those years at College Station, 
what effects did those have on your life and the

30:00.003 --> 30:06.370
kind of person you have become?

30:09.213 --> 30:15.600
They had a lot of effects on my life because I look 
back on them as still some of the best years. And

30:17.102 --> 30:21.407
I've had a wonderful life from beginning to end. 
I've just never known anybody so fortunate.

30:31.424 --> 30:40.554
I was trying to think of some of the things that I... 
Did it affect your set of values, your attitudes

30:31.424 --> 30:40.554
about people? No, I think I've stayed about the 
same. Children might have an answer to that. Let's

30:50.244 --> 30:50.765
see. All right. Next to the last question. Let's 
make believe that someone gives you a million

30:53.147 --> 30:59.254
dollar check with only one requirement you must 
give it to texas a m but you can decide what they are

30:59.977 --> 31:25.360
to do with it what would you tell if you could give a m 
a million dollars what would what would you want

30:59.977 --> 31:25.360
them to do with it send the girls home

30:59.977 --> 31:25.360
send the girls home yeah it's not it's not quite 
it's not the same now that it But now that wouldn't

31:25.660 --> 31:28.525
cost any money, though. What would? Oh, to spend 
money on it. Well, just make a bigger and better

31:35.919 --> 31:39.125
college.

31:41.329 --> 31:42.291
Then the last question. What are your feelings 
about Texas A&M today? Same they've always been. I

31:50.162 --> 31:52.205
just loved at Texas A&M. It was a real special time 
for me. And there was anything I accomplished or

31:57.114 --> 32:05.488
did that would help you in what you're doing.
