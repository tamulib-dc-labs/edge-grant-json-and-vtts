WEBVTT

00:05.583 --> 00:12.513
On the bed making, when you were a fish, you had to 
make somebody else's bed on a regular basis? No,

00:12.533 --> 00:15.397
normally not. What about when you were an 
upperclassman? Did you have a fish make your bed?

00:18.542 --> 00:21.506
No, we usually made our own. I was curious, some of 
the people... You'd get some fish in there to help

00:21.526 --> 00:24.751
us clean up. Some of the people indicated that when 
they were a fish, they had to make the bed. Well,

00:28.757 --> 00:29.418
they did. Some of those boys did. I don't think we 
ever did bother about it a great deal.

00:39.670 --> 00:42.900
Did you have any favorite instructors while you 
were there? Oh, yeah, we had some nice people. We

00:46.450 --> 00:53.511
had a

00:46.450 --> 00:53.511
lot of them that I don't remember.

00:57.608 --> 01:02.053
A fellow named Jim, Slim Jim Hayden, I think, was a 
biology professor. Everybody liked him. Yes,

01:03.375 --> 01:04.316
Sabine Paul. Everybody liked him. And old Duke 
Thornton was a chemical department, chemistry

01:06.599 --> 01:15.970
department prof. Everybody liked old Duke. He's 
still living in College Station. You don't mean

01:18.393 --> 01:19.775
it. Is that right? Yeah. My associate interviewed 
him a couple weeks ago. Is that right? Yeah, I knew

01:25.222 --> 01:26.383
him well. And pretty smart cookie, too, that 
chemistry. And animal husbandry department,

01:30.239 --> 01:36.468
there was a fellow named Burke, was a nice fellow. 
Bell, who later went, was hard-boiled, later went

01:36.488 --> 01:41.134
to Kansas. Made an outstanding name for himself in 
Kansas. Animal husbandry department, a fellow

01:45.260 --> 01:47.503
named Templeton. All under my own brother, see, 
who was head of the department at that time, so.

01:53.852 --> 01:54.953
And, uh... The other,

01:56.907 --> 02:02.395
I've forgotten. Did you ever have any classes 
under Dr. Mark Francis? Oh, yeah. Dr. Francis was

02:06.180 --> 02:08.824
something else. You bet. No, thank you. And 
Marsteller, I had a class under Dr. Francis.

02:14.733 --> 02:17.217
Marsteller, well, yeah. They were exceptional 
men, no doubt about it. I had gathered from what

02:22.405 --> 02:27.292
people told me that Dr. Francis was really 
something else. Oh, he was. He was a good

02:30.216 --> 02:31.438
storyteller. Oh, he was a good storyteller, and he 
was smart. Morstella was a fine man. He was very

02:38.848 --> 02:40.510
capable. Yeah, I enjoyed my vet work. I enjoyed my 
vet classes.

02:50.367 --> 02:53.390
I've forgotten, Lord, who all was it. You know, you 
forget those things of who the men were.

03:00.277 --> 03:03.240
I believe when you first went there, Milner was 
president. He resigned and Bazell came in. Well,

03:06.503 --> 03:09.366
Perea was made president pro tem. Perea was acting 
pro tem for a while. That's right. They saw the best

03:12.169 --> 03:15.092
part of Catfish Miller. How'd he get the name 
Catfish? God, I don't know. He had it when you got

03:19.233 --> 03:20.355
there. Yeah. And then Brazell came there.

03:26.244 --> 03:36.759
Because Brazell had a hard time

03:26.244 --> 03:36.759
changing his thinking from CIA down to A&M 
College. They made it pretty rough on him. The

03:39.303 --> 03:40.565
cadets did, you mean? You bet. They made it pretty 
hard on him. I can remember one instance that he was

03:46.645 --> 04:00.017
walking down the walk in front of Milner Hall and 
all of a sudden this water come tumbling down.

04:00.037 --> 04:01.639
Wasn't right, but it was funny.

04:06.923 --> 04:14.290
Did they come to respect him though before the... 
Oh yeah, Milner was a, he was a good good educator. I

04:15.995 --> 04:17.977
mean, Brazell was a good educator. Yes, he did a lot 
of A&M College. Had a nice family. Yeah, Brazell

04:22.522 --> 04:23.944
was all right. He just had a hard time fitting in 
down there because that dang school at that time

04:25.526 --> 04:31.373
was a little bit rough and ready, you know. A little 
bit different from girls' school. What about the

04:35.778 --> 04:37.360
commandant? You mentioned that Levi G. Brown is 
commandant. Well, he was replaced by a fellow

04:39.743 --> 04:43.888
named James R. Hill. And

04:45.353 --> 04:52.908
he wasn't as tough. Hill was a nice fella, but he 
wasn't hard-boiled as old Levi Brown. Levi Brown

04:57.437 --> 05:01.064
came out as, what, 7th Cavalry or 5th Cavalry? He 
was tough as a boot. But he made things run. Yeah.

05:05.671 --> 05:07.333
like they ought to be run, see. And he had some good 
sergeants under him there, see. They had some Army

05:09.736 --> 05:14.522
sergeants, retired Army sergeants there. There 
was old Sergeant Kenyon, Sergeant Smart,

05:14.542 --> 05:18.507
Sergeant Highland. And those boys all respected 
those boys. They got along. They knew people, see.

05:22.892 --> 05:24.134
Now what did the sergeants do? Did they teach 
military tactics of that nature? Well, they

05:27.538 --> 05:34.767
worked in the Commandant's office. and took care 
of a lot of the detail. And they'd make a periodical

05:39.075 --> 05:46.886
inspection of those dormitories and were around 
the campus all the time. Some fine men, real fine.

05:49.490 --> 05:54.337
All three of those fellows, everybody loved them 
and highly respected.

05:57.682 --> 06:00.045
When Hill came there, Hill was, I don't, I believe 
he was a lieutenant in the Army when they sent him

06:01.628 --> 06:05.053
in. He could have, not over a first, could have been 
second lieutenant. But old Levi G. Brown, he was

06:09.239 --> 06:13.526
some man, he was something else. You'd have to 
respect Levi Brown, although he was tough as a

06:13.546 --> 06:18.032
boot. The boys respected him. He covered all the 
ground he stood on. And although he put me in the

06:25.243 --> 06:30.591
bugle corps, I never did dislike him first. It was a 
lot of fun. Well, that didn't really hurt you going

06:31.852 --> 06:34.535
in the biblical court. No, it didn't hurt me. You 
didn't have to learn how to

06:35.417 --> 06:48.613
play. I didn't have to carry that gun. Did the

06:49.294 --> 07:01.690
cadets who were officers in the Corps have any 
special privileges as opposed to other cadets

06:49.294 --> 07:01.690
now? Earlier you said something about the senior 
privates could skip out on drills and things like

07:02.210 --> 07:06.356
that. Oh, well, the senior private had more fun 
than anybody because he didn't have to go to any

07:06.376 --> 07:10.582
formation. Of course, the senior officers had 
privileges that nobody else had in a way that they

07:10.682 --> 07:22.840
could get off and they could get furloughs and they 
could go to town and they could stay out after taps

07:10.682 --> 07:22.840
and those kind of things. Other than that, I was not 
aware of it because I was the buck private and I knew

07:23.281 --> 07:31.693
it. There

07:31.977 --> 07:36.322
wasn't much I could do about it.

07:40.708 --> 07:45.954
For a long time, a lot of the students who have gone 
to Texas A&M have had jobs of one sort or another.

07:46.435 --> 07:47.516
Did you have a job of any kind? No, I didn't. No, I was 
very fortunate that I didn't have to work my way

07:48.277 --> 07:51.361
through school. Now, Ron Stangle did work his way 
through school under my brother. First time I ever

07:56.187 --> 08:01.073
saw Ron Stangle, he was riding a 2,200-pound 
purchasing stallion. And, of course, short legs,

08:02.538 --> 08:06.123
and his legs sticking right straight out. I'll 
never forget. I've told it on him. It'll take many

08:08.667 --> 08:10.851
years later.

08:14.877 --> 08:16.179
Let's see. You graduated then in 16. Skip over a 
couple of years up to the time of the First World

08:18.983 --> 08:22.128
War. Did you have any role in that? No, I did not. I 
was in the cattle business, unfortunately, about

08:26.254 --> 08:32.123
spring of 1917. Really in 1917, just in time to get 
in the drought and was tied up with a bunch of cattle

08:32.997 --> 08:44.787
and impossible for me to go at that time. Later on I 
did go down to San Antonio and volunteered for the

08:44.827 --> 08:49.291
regular army. They sent me to Houston for 
examination and had us all build a whole bunch of us

08:50.072 --> 09:01.502
out at Rice Institute for physical. We were all 
built to go up to Louisville, Kentucky for

09:01.769 --> 09:09.400
artillery camp. The war was over before we ever got 
transferred up there. I went out to Fort Sam

09:14.388 --> 09:18.594
Houston, went to San Antonio and volunteered for 
regular Army. And the old colonel out there said,

09:18.614 --> 09:24.322
well, Mr. Burns, if you had an education, I told 
him, yeah, four years in A&M College. He said, you

09:24.342 --> 09:27.807
mean tell me you came out here to volunteer as a bug 
driver? I said, I'd just as soon be private as a

09:27.827 --> 09:30.271
colonel. The way it was to me. He said, well, I'm not 
going to take you. He said, I do want you to go over to

09:33.597 --> 09:35.821
Houston. I'm going to send you over to Houston. I 
want you to go over there and take an examination

09:37.443 --> 09:41.008
for artillery. So that's what I did. One of the 
things that I find of some interest, skipping back

09:44.614 --> 09:50.743
to your time on campus, You obviously weren't 
particularly excited about the military, but yet

09:51.061 --> 09:56.308
you got into the Ross Volunteers. Oh, yeah, yeah. 
Ross Volunteers was an honorary company, and it

09:57.710 --> 10:02.938
was a precision drill deal. We enjoyed it, you bet. 
Well, that was pretty much an honor, I take it, to be

10:04.880 --> 10:07.564
elected. That's right, you bet. It was really an 
honor military company is what it was. That's what

10:11.049 --> 10:15.195
I would consider it, yes.

10:16.053 --> 10:20.384
You were also on a couple of stock judging teams. 
Yeah, I was a member of the junior and senior stock

10:20.404 --> 10:23.713
judging team. How were you selected to be on the 
team? Well, for the proficiency and grades,

10:27.523 --> 10:32.155
evidently.

10:34.126 --> 10:37.290
This was not a separate organization in a sense. 
You were an animal husbandry and judging animals

10:37.310 --> 10:48.243
was part of your curriculum.

10:48.303 --> 10:55.431
We made a lot of trips in our junior year, Fort 
Worth, Oklahoma City, around. We were supposed to

10:55.451 --> 11:01.298
go to Chicago our senior year, but had foot and 
mouth disease, so we didn't get to make trips. I

11:02.476 --> 11:04.458
believe the same thing happened to Mr. Stangle. He 
didn't get to go to Chicago because of the same.

11:07.280 --> 11:08.761
Yeah, I think that's probably right. But he 
coached a team that won up there, I think. Yeah, I

11:12.285 --> 11:15.467
believe he would have been on the junior team when 
you were a senior. Yeah, that's right. You missed

11:16.048 --> 11:17.029
out on that.

11:20.832 --> 11:23.734
Now, you said after you graduated, you went into 
the livestock business. Yeah, the cattle

11:23.755 --> 11:25.596
business in West Texas. It hasn't been time to get 
caught in a bad drought of 1917 and 1918. I got a very

11:29.099 --> 11:32.382
liberal education in the cattle business. A very 
costly one. Very costly one.

11:38.454 --> 11:39.976
What finally developed with that? Well, of 
course, I got heavily involved financially and

11:40.477 --> 11:52.092
shipped cattle into New Mexico and into the 
Panhandle. Finally had to sell out. It took a long

11:55.836 --> 12:01.103
time to pay out.

12:01.640 --> 12:04.243
I believe you had something called the Burns 
Livestock Company. Yeah, that's right. And what,

12:04.864 --> 12:07.747
M-I-C-H-E-S, how you pronounce it? Yeah, it was 
down in Dawson, Borden County. We later sold that

12:10.411 --> 12:11.572
ranch. There were several of us interested in a 
family interest. We sold that ranch in 1929. I went

12:16.178 --> 12:23.627
to work for Texas National Cotton Seed Products 
Association, A.L. Ward, in the educational

12:23.647 --> 12:26.430
service. He was an A&M man, too, wasn't he? Yeah, 
1910 man. Mm-hmm. As a field man for them, and I

12:30.783 --> 12:42.863
traveled everything from Pennsylvania, Pacific 
Coast, Rio Grande River to Canada about six, seven

12:30.783 --> 12:42.863
years. And a real good education. And I contacted 
all the livestock people, the cattle people, the

12:47.591 --> 12:57.567
feedlot people, the sheep people, the 
experimental station people. I had made a very

12:58.323 --> 13:02.809
wide acquaintance during those years. This was 
what, in trying to develop a market for cottonseed

13:03.090 --> 13:07.235
products? A market for cottonseed products, 
that's right. That was a promotion deal and then

13:08.857 --> 13:18.070
sponsored by the Texas Cottonseed Crushers 
Association and the National Cottonseed

13:08.857 --> 13:18.070
Products Association. And purely a promotional 
deal, educational deal, educate the public how to

13:19.045 --> 13:28.616
use cottonseed products to the best advantage. 
And also to follow the experimental work that was

13:29.377 --> 13:34.664
going on at all the colleges and universities.

13:37.527 --> 13:38.448
Experiment station. And of course promoting the 
sale of cottonseed products to the large feeders,

13:44.476 --> 13:49.484
little ones and large ones too. Of course, the 
feedlot business was not like it is today with

13:51.968 --> 13:58.158
these big feedlots to the southwest. Primarily, 
all your beef cattle were fed in the corn belt. You

14:01.303 --> 14:04.708
shipped them up there and then shipped the meat 
back. Whereas today, you've got an entirely

14:04.768 --> 14:10.197
different setup.

14:11.594 --> 14:14.299
What would you describe as the setup today? I mean, 
there's still some cattle shipped to the corn

14:14.399 --> 14:20.509
belt. Oh, yes, they feed some cattle up there, but 
they've largely gone into a production deal up

14:20.529 --> 14:29.865
there, and a lot of farmers don't feed any cattle 
anymore. They sell the corn.

14:34.409 --> 14:56.130
There are a lot of cattle fed in Ohio and Indiana and 
Ohio and Nebraska and Pennsylvania, but the big

14:34.409 --> 14:56.130
feedlots, the big volume of fed cattle today is in 
the southwest, the Great Plains area, the

14:34.409 --> 14:56.130
panhandle in eastern New Mexico, western 
Oklahoma, southwestern Kansas, eastern

14:34.409 --> 14:56.130
Colorado. primary feed then? Grain sorghum 
production is largely responsible for it and the

14:59.877 --> 15:09.671
fact that they saved the freight on a lot of these 
cattle going to Corn Belt. A close source of grain

15:11.434 --> 15:16.061
and a close source of protein, your cotton seed 
products. Cotton seed products with protein.

15:21.910 --> 15:23.552
Probably has been overdone. I'm afraid it has 
been. It looks like a lot of these boys are in

15:26.649 --> 15:30.999
trouble, bad trouble. Producing too much beef, 
you mean? No, too many feedlots. Competition got

15:37.856 --> 15:40.663
pretty keen for feeder cattle. Bought some of them 
too high, and then they had the freeze on beef last

15:41.032 --> 15:48.403
year, which was so uncalled for. Let it alone 
worked itself out. Then you had your boycotts, and

15:51.427 --> 15:55.954
then you had your truck and strike. Everything 
that worked against orderly marketing. Well, the

16:00.927 --> 16:11.925
freeze on the price of the beef and the failure to 
freeze the cost of the feed was really the

16:00.927 --> 16:11.925
disastrous part of it. That's right. And then, of 
course, since that time, well, cattle prices of

16:12.526 --> 16:19.898
beef have gone way down. People held a lot of cattle 
that shouldn't have been held. It should have

16:24.357 --> 16:32.389
continued to market because you get over finished 
cattle on the market and they've been a drug on the

16:24.357 --> 16:32.389
market ever since. Just now begin to get out from 
under them. The tremendous amount of grain that

16:36.836 --> 16:43.286
was exported ran the grain feed price way up. 
There's no doubt about that.

16:49.004 --> 16:58.780
I'm pretty optimistic about the fat cattle price, 
but I'm not very optimistic about the cattle

16:49.004 --> 16:58.780
business generally for the next few years. But you 
think this is going to be a cycle that it'll level

16:58.800 --> 17:02.747
out ultimately? It always has. Yeah? Yeah. So 
there's every reason to believe that it will

17:07.395 --> 17:09.077
again. It's not new, you know. No, no. I've seen 
several of these wrecks. Yeah. Well, I know

17:13.405 --> 17:14.927
that... My grandfather in Lee County was involved 
in the cattle business for a long time, and since

17:15.481 --> 17:27.399
his death, my grandmother and my father have been 
involved, and the price has gone up and down and up

17:15.481 --> 17:27.399
and down. Those people who, when the price goes up 
and they buy a few cattle and are going to make a

17:27.439 --> 17:36.894
killing, and then the price drops and they have to 
sell less than they bought, they lose their shirt.

17:37.114 --> 17:37.875
That's right. I've seen all of it happen. Stay in 
it. Why? lose sometimes and win sometimes, but

17:42.953 --> 17:47.240
overall I guess they do fairly well. You were with 
the Pitchfork Land and Cattle Company for a good

17:49.063 --> 17:55.633
long while.

17:58.538 --> 18:02.765
Were you involved in part ownership of that? Well, 
I was a stockholder in it.

18:07.553 --> 18:09.636
Later made a direct of the company.

18:12.164 --> 18:22.278
I stayed with the Cotton Seed Products 
Association until about 1934 or 1935.

18:26.323 --> 18:34.054
For a short time I was associated with Trader's Oil 
Mill at Fort Worth.

18:35.384 --> 18:42.659
Later with Anderson Clayton as acting sales 
manager for 11 oil mills that they owned in West

18:35.384 --> 18:42.659
Texas. Western Cotton, they called it West Texas 
Cotton Oil Company at that time, Abilene. So they

18:49.053 --> 18:52.681
moved me to Abilene, made me acting sales manager 
down there. And I stayed there several years. uh,

18:56.613 --> 18:59.557
moved me to San Angelo about 1940. The West Texas 
Cotton Oil Company was a subsidiary of Anderson

18:59.898 --> 19:05.185
Clayton. That's right. Uh, during the years I was 
at Abilene, I was principally in sales

19:07.629 --> 19:13.978
organization. I was sales manager, handle the 
sales for the group of mills that Anderson Clayton

19:13.998 --> 19:20.107
owned. Uh, In 1942, I went to Pitchfork Land and 
Cattle Company at Guthrie with own rights of

19:22.837 --> 19:37.115
approximately 120,000 acres in King and Dickens 
County, 85 miles east of Lubbock. As manager there

19:37.135 --> 19:43.283
and stayed with those people 23 years. I'm still 
associated with them, still on their board of

19:44.264 --> 19:47.528
directors. In 1947, we bought 43,000 acres of 
country for the first part of the Matador Land

19:48.672 --> 20:00.986
Cattle Company that was cut up, which had joined 
us. In 1952, we bought 50 sections of country in

20:01.006 --> 20:10.417
Wyoming and Laramie and Albany County, Laramie, 
Wyoming, which we still operate. And I retired at

20:12.039 --> 20:17.245
the age of 70 in 1965. Although, as I said, I do 
remain on the board and still act in an advisory

20:17.444 --> 20:30.926
capacity and handle their real estate and some oil 
leases and stuff for the company. So the company

20:30.986 --> 20:37.236
owns land and operates them as ranches, but also 
has oil leases? No, no. They've leased a lot of it,

20:37.937 --> 20:40.562
but they don't have any oil. Uh-huh. Have they 
leased other people's lands? No, no. I have leased

20:46.014 --> 20:51.585
out two different oil companies who've drilled 
wells over there, see. I've handled those leases.

20:53.109 --> 20:54.872
But they haven't hit any oil yet? No, just haven't 
been lucky enough, that's all. But when you were

20:57.898 --> 21:02.588
manager, Did you have control over both the Texas 
and the— Yes, I was general manager, executive

21:03.530 --> 21:10.077
manager of the company. So you had both— Control, 
all of it was cleared through me. So you had both the

21:14.801 --> 21:17.004
Texas and the Wyoming property. Yes. And that was 
quite a chunk of land. Well, we had between 100 and

21:20.908 --> 21:25.312
90 and 200,000 acres of country. And how many head 
of cattle did you have? Well, it varied, of course.

21:30.445 --> 21:39.139
weather condition, market conditions, but from 8 
to 10,000 cattle most years. Did you run both range

21:40.481 --> 21:43.406
cattle and a feedlot operation? No, no, we did not. 
We fed some cattle during that time, but largely a

21:44.868 --> 21:56.267
production proposition, range cattle 
production, and maintained a registered herd of

21:57.023 --> 22:01.131
cattle for replacement bulls. So you would just 
keep the calves up until the time they would be

22:01.151 --> 22:06.081
ready to go to a feedlot? Well, the reason we bought 
the Wyoming ranch is that we had been selling light

22:06.202 --> 22:13.817
yearlings in the spring and We figured it would be 
more profitable to carry these light cattle and

22:14.371 --> 22:21.422
get a cheap summer gain on them and sell them in the 
fall. That's the reason we bought the Wyoming

22:21.923 --> 22:23.846
rights. And we still maintain it. And we still send 
some cattle up there. It's been years. It has been

22:29.354 --> 22:32.920
more advantageous to us to sell these cattle. or 
maybe precondition them and put them in the

22:33.389 --> 22:38.735
feedlot down here rather than to go to Wyoming with 
them. In those years, we bought outside cattle and

22:38.755 --> 22:47.065
light yearlings in the fall, wintered them, and 
summered them and made two-year-old cattle out of

22:38.755 --> 22:47.065
them. Really a thing that we're still doing. So 
your operation is influenced a good bit by the

22:52.572 --> 22:59.059
market conditions, the weather conditions? 
Range conditions, and it's flexible. That's

23:01.643 --> 23:02.063
right. As it would have to be if you wanted to stay in 
business. Yeah, that's right. That's right.

23:06.546 --> 23:06.646
Yeah. Mr. Barnes and I lived over at the ranch 23 
years. Where are you living now? I live out here on

23:11.413 --> 23:13.796
19th Street. And we bought a home here in 1963. And 
the day they shot Kennedy. And we remodeled it and

23:19.965 --> 23:27.235
redecorated it and air conditioned it. Moved up 
here in 65 when we left the ranch. So you haven't

23:31.844 --> 23:37.350
lived on the ranch then for about nine years. But 
you still keep a pretty close tie to it. Yeah, down

23:42.095 --> 23:44.677
there pretty often. Except for the young man who 
succeeded me as manager. He came to me in 1948 and

23:48.902 --> 23:53.026
he's still there.

23:56.730 --> 24:01.035
Okay.

24:01.055 --> 24:01.395
Okay. I made a reference a few minutes ago to an old 
fellow who was with the military department of A&M

24:01.932 --> 24:11.802
College for many years named Sergeant Kenny. 
Sergeant Kenny was a big, fat fellow, and

24:11.822 --> 24:16.167
everybody loved him. Sort of gruff, but a fine 
character. During my junior year in the spring, we

24:22.273 --> 24:28.319
used to have a few keg rolling. That was before 
brown went dry. So we had a few keg rollers and get

24:31.565 --> 24:37.772
some negro boy to bring us a keg of beer. I can 
remember one April,

24:38.833 --> 24:50.485
a whole bunch of us got a keg of beer brought out to 
the old Experiment Station up on the hill between

24:38.833 --> 24:50.485
Brown and College.

24:53.909 --> 24:59.395
And we were having a beer party, and there were 
several on the campus in the surrounding area. But

25:00.725 --> 25:10.177
anyhow, Dr. Brazell and a commandant, Lieutenant 
Hill, came down the road and saw us. And of course

25:10.197 --> 25:18.167
the car came and the boys ran off in a cotton patch on 
one side of the road, some of them on the other side.

25:18.747 --> 25:21.551
So they went up to where they could turn around and 
came back. They went back to the campus and

25:22.392 --> 25:28.960
instigated a midnight inspection and caught a lot 
of boys absent. Some of them had gone to the

25:30.205 --> 25:35.152
latrine, some of them were sleeping on the roof, so 
they'd say it. And some of them were just gone.

25:40.359 --> 25:47.008
Well, there's a big hullabaloo, and they sent out a 
request that you were absent. So and so, midnight

25:48.630 --> 25:54.678
inspection, please report to the Commandant's 
Office explanation. Well, wherefore so? Well,

25:57.261 --> 25:58.423
you're absent. Well, some of us had permits to be in 
bronze, some of them, as I said, sleeping on the

26:00.614 --> 26:08.222
roof, and some of them going to the train one time. 
But one young fellow, who Sergeant Kenny had up

26:10.445 --> 26:19.174
before him, and he lived in San Angelo, and I 
believe he was a freshman. And with us were several

26:21.596 --> 26:24.900
juniors, I think it was my junior year. And I think 
both, one or two juniors, I believe both of them are

26:26.365 --> 26:30.990
gone now. One was a very dear friend of mine. He and I 
went through a lot of things up and down this day in M

26:33.653 --> 26:37.637
College. This young man from St. Angelo, and I 
think he's still living. Sergeant Kennedy asked

26:46.126 --> 26:50.951
him, says, where were you last night at 12 o'clock 
midnight? It may have been midnight. It may have

26:53.154 --> 26:54.415
been 11, I don't know. He says, I was eating 
strawberries. He says, eating strawberries at

26:58.262 --> 27:00.485
that time? Yes. I said, get them while the dew's on 
them. It's all good. Old Sergeant Kenny says,

27:04.690 --> 27:08.695
young man, that's the biggest lie I've ever heard. 
All my years, that's the biggest lie I've ever

27:09.396 --> 27:14.682
heard.

27:15.683 --> 27:16.344
You can go. Let me ask you a question about 
something that's just occurred to me. There was a

27:20.429 --> 27:25.515
period of years, and I believe this may have been 
while you were there, that In the spring of the

27:25.934 --> 27:31.380
year, the cadets kind of went on an extended hike 
onto the Brazos River. Oh, yes, yes, I made several

27:31.400 --> 27:33.662
of those, you bet. You walk down, walk back, and 
carry that gun with you. And a bedroll, too, huh?

27:38.387 --> 27:39.549
That's right. How long did you stay there when you 
went?

27:44.154 --> 27:45.515
I reckon I stayed all night. I don't know. I've 
forgotten. I remember walking down there,

27:46.756 --> 27:50.360
camping down there. What did you do when you got 
there? Oh, they had target practice down there,

27:52.242 --> 28:04.556
platoon practice, and extended order drill, some 
stuff like that. Someone once said that it was to

28:05.197 --> 28:09.161
keep you out of mischief on April Fool's Day. Oh, 
yeah, yeah, that's right. That's the reason it was

28:10.262 --> 28:12.465
originated, I understand. It's a pretty good long 
hike down there. Yeah, I got, well, if you follow

28:16.369 --> 28:18.992
the road to the, To the Jones River Bridge, it's 
nine miles. That's right. It was nine miles then,

28:22.593 --> 28:24.094
too. That's right. I still have some old pictures 
that were taken on that hike. That's right. We have

28:33.225 --> 28:38.491
a few pictures in the archives of some of those 
hikes, and we have one big long one. It must be about

28:38.511 --> 28:40.413
three and a half feet long. It's kind of a panoramic 
view of the encampment. I believe that was in 1910

28:43.296 --> 28:46.140
or 11, something like that. Yeah, yeah. Well, 
these pictures taken, I forgot what year, what

28:47.120 --> 28:54.151
spring, but I still have some of them. There's very 
few of my classmates still living. Most of them are

28:56.434 --> 28:57.276
gone. Yeah, I can imagine, too. I have one very dear 
friend who lives in Greenville, South Carolina,

29:00.120 --> 29:08.613
that I hear from very often. Most of my other close 
companions are gone. I have one very dear friend

29:13.120 --> 29:15.844
who lives in Dallas. I believe he told me the other 
day when I called him as I came through Dallas from

29:16.347 --> 29:24.751
St. Louis that he was 80, I believe he told me 81, 82. 
He says I walk a mile every day. He's in pretty good

29:27.538 --> 29:28.702
health. Yeah, must be to do that.
