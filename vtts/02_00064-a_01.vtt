00:02.883 --> 00:06.267
I have the pleasure and honor of interviewing 
Colonel Fred Dollar today. It's Groundhog Day,

00:06.307 --> 00:13.855
2nd of February, 1999, and we're in the conference 
room in the Evans Library.

00:16.598 --> 00:31.354
Colonel Dollar, to start with, for the sake of 
those who may listen or read this in years to come,

00:16.598 --> 00:31.354
give us a brief biographical summary of your life 
until you came here to A&M to work. We'll do another

00:31.705 --> 00:33.948
one on your student days here. But where did you 
grow up, and when were you here, and what did you do

00:34.548 --> 00:39.875
after you left campus before you came back? I grew 
up near Henderson, Texas. I was born on a farm or

00:42.558 --> 00:54.912
ranch combination where I learned some hard work 
and honesty and the things that families used to be

00:42.558 --> 00:54.912
taught. And did well through high school, got 
interested in debate. It was an old town, old

01:00.353 --> 01:08.306
country, but when the Beast Texas Oil Field came 
in, that changed the whole complexion. So that

01:09.067 --> 01:11.491
gave us a little ambition to spread out. So I came 
down here to school in 1940. I had a scholarship at

01:15.337 --> 01:21.928
Baylor, but I didn't go there because I had hay 
fever so badly. and i guess this is the worst place i

01:22.364 --> 01:51.814
could come to but i did at any rate so i came down here 
worked and left before i could finish because of we

01:22.364 --> 01:51.814
were we were inducted into the army in 1943 but i had 
enough grade points so that when i got my

01:22.364 --> 01:51.814
commission i completed my number of hours so they 
sent me my diploma in 1946 so i served in the

01:22.364 --> 01:51.814
military until 1965. Various parts of the world, 
regular U.S. Army, where I learned quite a few

01:53.629 --> 02:00.936
things. A lot of them I did not want to learn, but I 
did. And so that's the sum total of what happened

02:05.261 --> 02:08.745
before I came. Alright, so you got out of the Army in 
1965. To come here. And how did you and A&M get

02:15.151 --> 02:18.975
together then? Well, I had worked This has nothing 
to do with that immediately, but I had worked in the

02:21.832 --> 02:28.744
dining halls for Cliff Hotard when I was a student. 
Oh, yes. Well, in about 1964, I wrote a letter to one

02:29.946 --> 02:40.363
of the trade magazines in which I mentioned Texas 
A&M University. in the sense that they had an

02:41.153 --> 02:46.679
article on the Navy food service. So I said, Texas 
A&M's usually about 20 years ahead of the Navy. Why

02:51.144 --> 02:54.468
don't you do an article on Texas A&M? Well, I had met 
Earl Rudder, so I put a little note on a copy, and I

02:54.628 --> 03:03.518
just said on the note, you might get a kick out of 
this. Well, I was about ready to return to the

03:05.000 --> 03:09.625
continent of the United States, in 1965, and I had a 
letter from Clark Monroe who said, President

03:10.212 --> 03:26.895
Rudder brought me a letter from you, and he 
wondered if you might be interested in a job at this

03:10.212 --> 03:26.895
institution. He said, would you come and take a 
look at it? So I told my wife, I'll go just for fun, it

03:30.621 --> 03:34.206
won't amount to anything. I did. I went back and 
told her virtually the same thing. But then I had a

03:40.317 --> 03:45.344
telegram, in essence, to come quickly as you can. 
So I retired and came here. It was about, oh, I

03:48.168 --> 03:55.197
realized if I got any older, I'd have difficulty 
finding something anyway. So that was after 22

03:56.499 --> 04:00.384
years of military service. So I came here in 1965 
and worked immediately under Howard Vestal, Over

04:10.507 --> 04:13.950
him was Tom Cherry and then Earl Rudder. And I 
believe those were three of the greatest men that I

04:14.871 --> 04:18.815
have ever known. They were just outstanding in 
every respect that I have the greatest respect for

04:19.315 --> 04:24.580
them. All right, now let's talk about those three 
men because that's one of the clear important

04:24.800 --> 04:31.206
points. First, let's back up. When you came to 
visit the campus that first time with the

04:33.629 --> 04:39.214
possibility, What did you, where did they take 
you? Who did you meet with? Well, I just really met

04:44.085 --> 04:47.308
with those three people. And I stayed, spent the 
night in the Memorial Student Center and talked at

04:48.470 --> 05:02.505
length with the dinner that night and with Howard 
and Clark Monroe and their wives. And that was

05:03.847 --> 05:08.712
about it after we surveyed everything. I didn't 
really look at any food facilities, because

05:08.962 --> 05:16.091
actually they were exactly the same as they were 
when I left here. And had I known how dilapidated

05:17.472 --> 05:23.239
they were, I might not have come. But I had been 
hoping to return to this part of the country, but

05:24.201 --> 05:31.189
never thought about coming here. did they during 
this visit did they sit you down and interrogate

05:31.895 --> 06:00.147
you was there a oh no no they had looked into my 
background i found out later through the

05:31.895 --> 06:00.147
association of former students uh because they 
they knew people people here knew people there who

05:31.895 --> 06:00.147
knew me there so they they corresponded with them a 
little bit to find out what kind of person i might be

05:31.895 --> 06:00.147
here Now, Clark was the Director of Personnel. 
Personnel. And then Howard was... He called it

06:08.129 --> 06:13.377
Auxiliary Services then, and later Business 
Services. And then Mr. Cherry was the Vice

06:13.398 --> 06:20.168
President... President for Business Affairs, 
which included the Fiscal Affairs. And then Mr.

06:20.428 --> 06:24.455
Rutter was President. Describe, make believe 
someone hadn't ever seen Howard. describe him

06:29.540 --> 06:36.989
physically and then describe him in terms of his 
way of getting things done? Well, he was a very

06:37.550 --> 06:41.635
intelligent man, very cordial. And he told me, he 
said, I've been here only a month. And actually, I

06:45.700 --> 06:48.484
was the first person he ever hired. And he said, he 
told me that many times, but he's just a cordial,

06:49.685 --> 06:56.053
outgoing, open individual. And he didn't know a 
lot of things about the school particularly. One

07:01.762 --> 07:05.346
time he told me, he said, you know, I regret I'm not 
an Aggie. I said, Howard, you were a better Aggie

07:05.366 --> 07:11.274
the day you got here than a lot of people will ever 
be, which was true. And so it was just a casual,

07:12.335 --> 07:15.359
informal meeting. I think President Rudder made 
so many decisions, and I think he really made the

07:15.379 --> 07:24.730
decision because we went down to interview 
President Rudder all the time. Describe that.

07:26.105 --> 07:32.673
Well, we went in to see him, and he was always 
outgoing, very friendly. We had a little

07:33.294 --> 07:38.600
conversation about the military and just a little 
bit about the school. And he says, well, I wonder

07:39.501 --> 07:43.707
how hard you work. I said, President Rudder, my 
middle name is work. And beyond that, it was just a

07:47.712 --> 07:52.037
small talk. And that was the whole conversation 
then. There was no question about any technical

07:55.012 --> 08:00.438
information I had. I mentioned a little 
experiences, I believe, to Howard, but beyond

08:02.040 --> 08:07.686
that, we didn't talk about that either. It was just 
a fact I think that I already talked to people and

08:08.987 --> 08:24.124
knew some of the jobs I'd been in, and President 
Rutter was very prone to hire military people,

08:08.987 --> 08:24.124
apparently, which I didn't know when I came here. 
But then I learned that so many around were

08:24.610 --> 08:29.018
following him. I never would have guessed that. 
His office was then down in what we... In the

08:32.624 --> 08:33.907
system, old system. The one right... Right. Now 
the Williams building. Yes. Let's see. He didn't

08:41.660 --> 08:46.449
claim to be highly informed about food service. 
No, no, no, no, no, he didn't. And they didn't know

08:48.927 --> 08:52.333
of any changes that one had made. It was just wanted 
somebody to come and do the job. Why was the job

08:56.780 --> 08:58.763
vacant? Frank Nugent had been food director here 
for a short time, probably the shortest tenure

08:58.903 --> 09:07.638
anyone ever had in that job. And he had left shortly 
before that. Later on, I told Mr. Cherry, I said,

09:13.717 --> 09:20.787
you didn't necessarily need me, but you needed 
somebody immediately. And I think that might have

09:22.128 --> 09:26.514
been part of it. Did they offer you a salary and you 
accept, or was there some? No, that's very

09:31.581 --> 09:32.803
interesting. They offered me a salary, and I said, 
well, I would like to come for that, but I can't.

09:38.270 --> 09:50.047
because I said I have some obligations, including 
some sick children at the time, and I said I must

09:38.270 --> 09:50.047
meet those expenses, and I said otherwise I'd be 
delighted to come. And then we left it like that.

09:51.549 --> 09:58.799
That's one of the reasons I told my wife when I 
returned, I said we can just forget it and enjoy the

09:51.549 --> 09:58.799
trip. But they decided to give me whatever I said I 
needed, A hired vessel later on said, you're

10:04.358 --> 10:08.082
making more than I am. Of course, I'm sure that 
didn't last very long. All right, so you arrived

10:12.086 --> 10:18.613
then and began August 10, 1965. 1965, all right. 
And describe the responsibilities and

10:21.216 --> 10:27.683
facilities for which you were responsible. Well, 
I had just about total responsibility about as

10:28.034 --> 10:42.816
much as you can get for anything because Howard 
didn't believe in real close supervision, and

10:28.034 --> 10:42.816
neither did Mr. Cherry. So the facilities I had 
were Sabiza Hall, Duncan Hall, Memorial Student

10:42.836 --> 10:57.417
Center Food Services, Hotard Hall, believe it or 
not, Hotard Hall was not Hotard Hall then. It was a

11:00.860 --> 11:11.792
hall behind the post office, that is the campus 
post office, where we kept laborers who wanted to

11:00.860 --> 11:11.792
live there alone. We had many that had come in from 
various places, and some had been there for years,

11:11.812 --> 11:17.879
some who were single. Then we had a facility, Bryan 
Field, that small group, And beyond that, we had in

11:23.587 --> 11:36.981
the summertime a training camp at Junction, which 
is now Texas Tech property, arranged by one of our

11:23.587 --> 11:36.981
previous governors. And that was it. It was very 
limited. There were no snack bars like there are

11:40.064 --> 11:43.327
now. And the MSC had to serve as both snack bar and 
formal dining. A very restricted facility, by the

11:48.132 --> 11:52.176
way, compared to what we now have. and what we later 
built. About how many employees? Oh, we had, I

11:57.796 --> 12:05.907
started with about 600, and well, that was the 
summertime. We wound up with, or late, we wound up a

12:05.987 --> 12:12.156
little later with 800 employees. Of course, in the 
summer, one of the things that makes this job

12:12.963 --> 12:26.075
different from others as director of food 
services is that you have a tremendous group in the

12:12.963 --> 12:26.075
fall and main year you need. Then you must drop down 
to tremendous loads. And that's the reason when

12:30.399 --> 12:41.890
you budget, you must budget for about 170% more 
than your average sometimes because they have to

12:30.399 --> 12:41.890
be there when you need them and reduced when you 
don't need them. As you began, who were your key

12:46.983 --> 12:50.026
subordinates? Describe who they were and what 
they did. Well, we had some old-time chefs who had

12:52.910 --> 13:05.565
been here for, one of them I worked with in Sebiza, I 
had worked with when I was a student. Now, I worked

13:06.486 --> 13:07.928
really Under him, in an indirect way, Hoketard 
said I was his employee, but this was Mr. Willie

13:08.465 --> 13:21.004
Yeager, who's one of the world's greatest people, 
I guess. And he was a ball of fire, had been there for

13:21.825 --> 13:25.271
years. So we had him, and we had Mr. Plant and Duncan 
Hall, who had been here for years. And then we had

13:35.266 --> 13:36.548
hired Frank Nugent had started this just prior to 
my arrival, managers of the dining halls, which

13:36.865 --> 13:46.897
were called Miss Halls then. And they were Army 
sergeants. One fellow had come out of the Navy, but

13:54.346 --> 14:04.678
had quite a bit of knowledge of food and somewhat 
more formal dining affairs. than our old time

14:05.131 --> 14:08.654
chefs had here. And then we had a manager at the 
Memorial Student Center. But they were all, all

14:17.423 --> 14:34.480
those people were fine people, but they were not 
really what we needed to grow with, not because

14:17.423 --> 14:34.480
they were incapable, they just had not been over 
that hurdle previously. for the big affairs that

14:34.713 --> 15:00.180
you and others have witnessed here at a and which we 
built a lot of our pr later on because you arrived at

14:34.713 --> 15:00.180
about the time the growth in the enrollment was 
beginning just before it took off i suppose and uh

14:34.713 --> 15:00.180
we we later on had some what what we tried to do was to 
make a public relations affair out of everything

15:00.785 --> 15:06.914
we had at the Memorial Student Center. Now, we had a 
long time and a hard time getting into this because

15:07.434 --> 15:18.430
to hire people at very low salaries a lot of times, 
it was very difficult. I had some notes here to tell

15:19.391 --> 15:24.678
you one of the occasions we had that I'll never 
forget. We had two long 60-foot buffet tables.

15:30.468 --> 15:34.393
that was shrub trees and decorations of every 
type. This was one of the president's buffets,

15:35.294 --> 15:40.500
which you have attended many times. And Governor 
Clements came in and he,

15:41.562 --> 15:55.419
one of the board members introduced him to me and he 
came in and we shook hands when he entered. And he

15:55.439 --> 16:00.205
came in and he looked at that food display with 
those two 60-foot lines and all the things on it and

16:00.860 --> 16:06.928
the aroma coming off. And he grinned from ear to ear 
and he said, let me shake your hand again. Well,

16:12.916 --> 16:15.700
that was what we were trying to develop. And in a 
sense, that happened many times because on every

16:15.900 --> 16:30.360
occasion of those things, we not only had that 
mapped out down to the minute and the item and the

16:15.900 --> 16:30.360
people and everything, But we'd have a meeting 
after each one of those affairs to critique it and

16:30.863 --> 16:43.020
see, well, what could we do to make this 
president's buffet greater than it was the last

16:30.863 --> 16:43.020
time? On one occasion, Howard Bessel said to me, 
what did you serve? I said, Howard, we served

16:48.668 --> 16:52.093
everything we could think of. He said, that's 
great. Because he wanted us to do everything we

16:54.136 --> 16:56.820
could do. In other words, he wanted... And I 
wanted, as you and others wanted, to be the best at

17:00.158 --> 17:06.185
everything we did. Well, if you try hard enough, 
sometimes you will. Now, there must have been some

17:10.591 --> 17:17.339
great successes, meals, some big meals that you 
remember. What were some of the biggest ones that

17:18.260 --> 17:24.327
you can recall in terms of the crowd and the 
success? Well, some of the biggest ones were just

17:25.049 --> 17:29.994
small affairs. I don't mean small in numbers, but 
not with great importance attached to them like

17:30.354 --> 17:42.567
the 4-H Club. We fed those people. That was one of 
the things that was an outstanding

17:44.168 --> 17:51.816
accomplishment, I think, We filled Cebiza 
upstairs and downstairs with about 4,000 people

17:52.353 --> 18:02.006
in a very short time. And to feed that many in a short 
time was unheard of in many places. What would have

18:09.076 --> 18:10.939
been the menu? Well, for that number, we had a We had 
one item which was chicken on that occasion with

18:15.083 --> 18:23.631
the vegetables and dessert and the salad and such. 
But what we did was a system that was later put into

18:23.851 --> 18:29.276
dunking. This is where the idea came from for that 
arrangement that's there now. Where they passed

18:34.641 --> 18:41.267
down this, we were assembling plates as fast as 
they could walk. So we were able to serve that

18:41.287 --> 18:44.230
number And about the time it would take you to go 
down a cafeteria line over here in one of the

18:44.733 --> 18:51.881
commercial cafeterias. And this is a system we use 
in developing the Dunkin' Dining Center, which is

18:52.722 --> 19:13.727
now a center that can be used continuously if it 
needs to be with thousands of people for

18:52.722 --> 19:13.727
self-service with not only with one item, it has a 
variety of menu items that can be served. We

19:14.095 --> 19:19.643
developed three different systems here, really, 
for the first time. And we had a lot of firsts, not

19:20.465 --> 19:25.933
because we were trying to get firsts, but it just 
developed that way. When we renovated Sbiza

19:25.953 --> 19:38.451
Dining Center, we had the first comprehensive 
fast food in conjunction with a regular menu that

19:25.953 --> 19:38.451
had ever been offered in the United States. About 
when was that? That was in 1976. and

19:43.154 --> 19:48.628
it wasn't completed until 77. And there we had 
where you walk up and get the hot pizza, the

19:48.888 --> 19:58.513
hamburgers, and the other fast foods. And the 
first The first time we offered, we'd offer those

19:59.810 --> 20:06.959
items one at a time, and it'd be such a shock to 
students that line up out the door. First time

20:07.060 --> 20:13.008
they'd ever been served hot pizza anywhere, 
because that just couldn't be done for student

20:07.060 --> 20:13.008
dining. Same way with hamburgers. They were 
coming right off the line, and it worked quite

20:14.770 --> 20:18.435
well. Then when we opened Commons Dining, down 
where we have Kruger, Dunn, Moser, Astin, We

20:26.928 --> 20:32.820
developed there what we called an accordion 
style. And we did it by necessity, not to be smart or

20:32.840 --> 20:38.732
outstanding or anything. It was just something we 
had to do. We divided a long cafeteria line that

20:40.976 --> 20:48.852
would have been long into several sections with 
duplicate meats. and vegetables so that we

20:49.355 --> 21:03.636
duplicated everything in just a few feet and put 
little bars about an inch high so that people

20:49.355 --> 21:03.636
couldn't slide their trays that got off the beat. 
And we could serve in a line that would only serve

21:03.656 --> 21:12.368
one person, we could serve five people at a time. 
And it was amazing how fast that went. And then the

21:16.152 --> 21:20.180
third thing, we call that the accordion style. 
Then in Duncan Dining Center, we developed this

21:20.200 --> 21:34.788
concept of having all of the salads and the 
beverages outside where people could pick them up

21:20.200 --> 21:34.788
as they came in, that is the customer. And then a 
variety of foods at different stations they could

21:39.473 --> 21:48.582
see and go directly to and take whatever they 
wanted and then go back for all they wanted when

21:39.473 --> 21:48.582
they finished that. And for lack of a better name, 
we called that plate ready because we were

21:48.822 --> 21:59.433
assembling the plates as they came along so the 
Corps can eat rapidly in great numbers. And that's

22:00.574 --> 22:09.463
the first time that we had that for the Corps 
because this school, when I came here, was all

22:00.574 --> 22:09.463
family-style service. And the military 
academies are still family-style service. Now,

22:17.030 --> 22:27.181
we had people from all over the United States to 
come look at the facilities and those dining

22:17.030 --> 22:27.181
arrangements. And the Army used those as some of 
their examples in improving their new designs for

22:28.103 --> 22:38.674
their dining facilities. Now, I don't think they 
did a good job of it, but their consultants came and

22:39.245 --> 22:52.561
looked at those, and they came back the second 
time, and they paid us a great compliment. In fact,

22:52.681 --> 23:00.611
they mentioned us in some of their publications, 
but they said, we find problems other places. We

23:00.651 --> 23:02.333
find solutions here. Well, that might not be 
entirely true, but it's nice to hear sometimes.

23:06.838 --> 23:08.340
Where did you turn... as you were trying to bring 
about these changes and advancements, where did

23:08.523 --> 23:16.755
you turn for ideas, advice, counsel? Well, I had 
studied a lot of this in the military because I'd

23:17.376 --> 23:31.257
been in supply work primarily, purchasing, 
storage, supply, transportation of food. I'd

23:31.458 --> 23:35.003
been in charge of this in Korea and the Far East. So I 
had seen that, and I knew that was not what we

23:35.810 --> 23:40.494
wanted. So I started looking at all the 
outstanding commercial places and institutions

23:41.295 --> 23:54.006
that I could identify to get ideas where I could put 
them together. And from that, from what I already

23:54.887 --> 24:02.474
knew, we came up with these different things. 
Where did you get some of the good ideas? Can you

24:04.296 --> 24:05.817
name some specific? Well, I think University of 
Tennessee. I used to say I'd steal these ideas. And

24:14.463 --> 24:17.269
I'd steal them from almost everywhere. From SMU, I 
stole an idea or two. From the Humble Building in

24:20.275 --> 24:25.645
Houston.

24:26.013 --> 24:34.582
And almost any place I'd go, I'd try to find 
something that I could use, some little

24:26.013 --> 24:34.582
something. And it worked pretty well. I think it 
worked today, really, because you never do reach

24:36.684 --> 24:43.711
perfection in this or anything else, in most 
cases. Now, you were in charge from 65 till? To 87.

24:50.899 --> 24:54.282
87, right. When you started out, you said six to 
seven hundred employees. What was it when you

25:00.443 --> 25:01.884
retired? Well, we had gotten up to...

25:09.273 --> 25:13.838
It seems like we'd gotten about 8,000, but my 
numbers might be a little bit off. All right, and

25:14.038 --> 25:18.203
then do you remember what the annual budget was? 
Yes, when I retired, it was probably about close to

25:18.483 --> 25:24.370
five million. Do you remember what it was when you 
started? No, but I knew it had been quite a long,

25:26.411 --> 25:35.265
probably maybe a third, not even a third of that, I 
think. When you started, the workforce was made up

25:35.685 --> 25:43.277
of men, women, black, white? Mostly men. Very few 
women. A mixture of black, white, and Spanish. And

25:52.328 --> 26:04.740
one of the amazing things that was originally 
needed, what was then, what is now Hookard Hall,

25:52.328 --> 26:04.740
was that we'd solicit often in order to get people 
to work. We would solicit people in South Texas

26:05.842 --> 26:15.371
with the radio stations would do this free for us, 
public relations on their part. So we'd hire

26:15.391 --> 26:19.235
people, and we might have hired many wetbacks. I 
don't know. But we had everybody that would come.

26:25.022 --> 26:27.004
We would hire them. And a lot of them wouldn't stay 
but a week or two, and that was a very difficult

26:27.024 --> 26:31.148
thing. We were paying so little, it was 
ridiculous. Do you remember what the pay was then?

26:36.874 --> 26:42.820
Well, I remember, I believe one of my outstanding 
cooks made 86 cents an hour. And that was a

26:42.840 --> 26:50.668
commitment for 13 hours a day because it was a split 
shift. And that is where, for anyone that wouldn't

26:51.813 --> 27:07.133
know, where you come in early in the morning, you 
work until the afternoon, then you get a break for

26:51.813 --> 27:07.133
two or three hours, then you're back working in the 
evening until the work is finished. And some of

27:07.153 --> 27:14.462
those poor fellows never saw all their homes, I 
think, in the daylight, except in the summertime.

27:14.763 --> 27:24.214
and sometimes on the weekend, and they were paid on 
a basis of an eight-hour shift for that 13, 14-hour

27:14.763 --> 27:24.214
obligation. One of the comical things that I think 
about often is that one day when it became obvious

27:24.335 --> 27:37.490
that we were the only ones still trying to do this, 
or one of the few, I said, we're going to change

27:24.335 --> 27:37.490
this. We're going to have two shifts every day. 
Some of the old-timers said it won't work. I said,

27:44.851 --> 27:49.457
well, it works everywhere else seemed like. They 
said, yes, but it won't work here. And so can you

27:52.421 --> 28:03.155
imagine what trouble we would have been in with the 
government if we had tried to continue a split

27:52.421 --> 28:03.155
shift? It was terrible. Well, the beautiful thing 
about all this was that people like Howard Vestal

28:04.116 --> 28:11.145
and Tom Cherry We're just 100% behind everything I 
did. One of the greatest things I read happened to

28:15.443 --> 28:22.370
me one day before we started most of this building 
program. Hired a best with Ken Burnett and said,

28:22.390 --> 28:27.416
well, he said, I want you to know, Mr. Chair and I 
have talked, we want you to build anything you

28:27.476 --> 28:30.159
need. Well, that was music to my ears. Now, we made 
our own money, and a lot of people didn't know that.

28:37.707 --> 28:40.069
They thought we got money from the state somewhere 
else but we generated our own money but but we had to

28:40.454 --> 29:08.554
get once it came in it was under school state 
control so we had to get permission and spend it so

28:40.454 --> 29:08.554
we we were woefully low on salaries and on monies 
for our facilities and to the extent it was it was

28:40.454 --> 29:08.554
almost pathetic well the first thing we started on 
was to renovate Subiza, we mentioned before. One

29:11.967 --> 29:16.273
of the few things I've done before that, we had no 
color on campus. You'd be surprised at how drought

29:16.313 --> 29:19.699
everything was. There was a little bit of color in 
Memorial Student Center, but very little, very

29:19.719 --> 29:24.346
little. A carpet on the rug would have been 
forbidden like this one here. It was just, it

29:28.552 --> 29:31.877
couldn't be tolerated. Well, I painted the 
entrance of the basement to Subiza chartreuse.

29:37.610 --> 29:43.578
And it looked so conspicuous, I thought I'd 
probably be called on the carpet for it. And now

29:43.598 --> 29:45.600
that would be a jubilee, of course. But that's just 
how things were. Everything was tan or brick red or

29:47.623 --> 29:54.191
brown. And that was the color scheme. All right, 
you get here in 65. What was the first major change

29:59.017 --> 30:02.942
that you undertook? Well, I believe that was a 
renovation of Sebesa. I really worked on that 10

30:07.981 --> 30:09.824
years. I'm slow, so I worked on the renovation of 
Duncan. The thoughts and the diagrams, that is 10

30:15.673 --> 30:18.838
years. I worked 10 years on Sebesa. I told somebody 
once I couldn't do anything less than two years.

30:25.428 --> 30:32.018
Were the food preparation facilities located at 
each of the three Sebesa, Duncan, and the MSC, they

30:32.251 --> 30:35.576
prepared their own? You didn't bake it at one place 
and take it over there? The only central

30:38.981 --> 30:45.972
production was the bakery at Duncan, and we baked 
everything there. There was a rumor for the

30:46.352 --> 30:52.542
students at Duncan over in the Corps that 
everything was cooked in Sebesa. Well, I wanted to

30:53.403 --> 31:01.515
have a little fun out of that, so in the basement of 
Sebesa, when we did one of the conversions, named

31:01.748 --> 31:21.917
the basement the Underground and then the one 
section the Underground Railroad and we built a

31:01.748 --> 31:21.917
caboose and so that I said yes there it is we use this 
train from this point to transport the food Well,

31:22.454 --> 31:25.463
you know, I never heard the rumor after that day. It 
was so ridiculous. Not even they could. They had to

31:28.754 --> 31:30.399
laugh at it. You mentioned bakery.
