00:01.094 --> 00:13.572
For some people

00:01.094 --> 00:13.572
it

00:01.094 --> 00:13.572
is. I'm sort of a garrulous

00:13.772 --> 00:28.873
kind of guy, so it doesn't bother me to talk about 
it. I enjoy telling some of the stories. Some of

00:33.000 --> 00:35.624
them are a little tough to tell. Some of them are, 
you know, I was young and foolish, so I did some

00:38.469 --> 00:50.848
things that if I had a little sense I wouldn't have 
done. But I did some other things that I thought

00:51.248 --> 00:54.393
were pretty neat. And the flare shoot's one of 
them.

01:00.460 --> 01:04.145
I don't know that you want that on tape, but I'll 
tell you that later. Okay. What's your reaction to

01:05.927 --> 01:26.132
some of the, I won't say hype, but some of the, sort 
of for our generation, the perception that we have

01:05.927 --> 01:26.132
is mainly through movies like War on the Fourth of 
July, Platoon, just the Hollywood image. What's

01:27.233 --> 01:28.535
your... Remember the movie The Deer Hunter? I 
think I have seen that. That's a fantasy. It has

01:33.856 --> 01:37.420
nothing to do with what happened over there at all. 
What was the movie with...

01:47.249 --> 01:49.071
I can't remember his name. It's a guy who's a leader 
of indigenous troops in Cambodia or Laos or

01:49.091 --> 01:54.957
somewhere. Marlon Brando plays the heavy...

02:00.839 --> 02:04.445
Anyway, another fantasy, absolute fantasy. 
Platoon, the guy had an axe to grind. He had a point

02:06.809 --> 02:13.940
that he wanted to make, and he had the backing and 
the, you know, he was in control of the writing and

02:06.809 --> 02:13.940
direction and production and all that. He made his 
point. You try to make it sound like that kind of

02:16.244 --> 02:22.453
stuff happened all the time.

02:23.555 --> 02:23.936
It didn't. It did not. You hear about... On the 4th 
of July, I've been told I shouldn't see, so I didn't

02:29.594 --> 02:34.699
bother to see it. But I've heard it's a good movie. 
There's a movie called Go Tell the Spartans with

02:36.341 --> 02:45.771
Burt Lancaster that's not quite as bad as The Green 
Berets with John Wayne. Although that had some

02:45.791 --> 02:48.694
accurate stuff in it. It was also pretty hyped up. 
Go Tell the Spartans was pretty accurate.

02:56.422 --> 02:58.825
There's another one that was pretty accurate. I 
can't remember what it was. But in the movie

03:02.971 --> 03:11.645
Platoon, as much as this was this guy's 
perspective, he's entitled to his perspective.

03:11.665 --> 03:22.723
There's a scene at a fire base for an LZ of some kind

03:11.665 --> 03:22.723
where it was so real that I could smell it. Sitting 
in the movie theater, I could smell it, which is

03:22.743 --> 03:27.090
a... There's some scenes, some smells, some 
sights and sounds you never

03:28.893 --> 03:39.648
forget. The scene was of

03:39.668 --> 03:45.976
how they handled the cranes. It was pretty 
primitive. Basically, they used oil drums cut in

03:51.624 --> 03:57.432
half with diesel fuel, and they burned it. To this 
day, when I see something

03:59.453 --> 04:07.461
like that, I can smell it. That's one of the things 
we always used to say, that the language we'd use

04:07.481 --> 04:12.987
was pretty crude, but there are things that get 
rough over here. You know, you think you're having

04:13.007 --> 04:19.774
a bad day, say at least you're not a Vietnamese with 
that job.

04:20.535 --> 04:24.860
The movies are, in the main, they're just very 
narrow. Somebody trying to... to say here's what

04:26.420 --> 04:32.548
my experience was, and if that's real to that 
person, that's okay. But it does give a distorted

04:32.568 --> 04:35.993
picture of the whole thing. Do you think it's good 
that there is sort of a, I don't even say

04:36.013 --> 04:48.549
resurgence, that there is a lot of Hollywood type 
thing? Well, I think they finally, they're

04:48.569 --> 04:53.676
getting a little more realistic about it. It's 
just that the people pretty much take the last

04:56.575 --> 05:10.548
thing they see, and this is human nature, it's not 
just our culture or anything, and they scrap like

04:56.575 --> 05:10.548
that into everything goes this way. And, you know, 
in college, you can even read something within the

05:10.568 --> 05:16.254
covers of a hardcover book. And just because it's 
printed nicely and somebody went to the trouble to

05:17.075 --> 05:22.980
put the book together doesn't make it true. So you 
have to examine... all different sides of the

05:26.005 --> 05:29.469
question. When you're preparing a scholarly 
research, you don't get it all from one volume.

05:37.057 --> 05:37.418
That's plagiarism. You do original research,

05:37.438 --> 05:46.207
and you get different people's points of view. 
Because like I said, different people can go

05:46.227 --> 05:50.252
through the same place, same time, and come away 
with different perceptions. So I think the

05:50.272 --> 05:52.074
examination is good. I think the more that it's 
examined, the more people will find that me lying

05:52.094 --> 05:55.978
was an aberration. Not a matter of policy. We were 
not trained to do that. We were told explicitly we

06:01.022 --> 06:06.768
would not kill civilians. You hear about the 
inflated body counts? Yeah. May have occurred,

06:09.730 --> 06:12.093
okay? Where I operated, you didn't count, 
confirm, kill, unless somebody could touch the

06:12.113 --> 06:19.079
body. Sort of like counting coup. We did not 
inflate body count. And I guarantee that. I know

06:25.915 --> 06:27.137
that for a fact. I was at the reports sessions where 
the reports went forward. Do you think that was a

06:31.221 --> 06:33.604
lot different? Because that is something that you 
do here. Do you think that was different from

06:37.588 --> 06:41.572
another section, say, the ground? Could have 
been. But I do know that, remember I told you how few

06:42.613 --> 06:48.780
Americans were killed in the year I was there where 
I was?

06:51.494 --> 06:58.863
When we got body count of Vietnamese, of North 
Vietnamese, we got a lot, especially working with

06:51.494 --> 06:58.863
the works. We got 50 and 75 and 100 at a time. And one 
day, I got eight in one place. And I thought, boy,

07:11.279 --> 07:15.264
the war's really going on right here where I was. 
And province-wide that day, we got 400.

07:21.852 --> 07:24.815
And you could touch each body. A friend of mine got 
shot down after six months in country and had a

07:24.835 --> 07:39.468
journalism degree and was tagged to be on the 
Typhoon, the newspaper for two corps. And, or not,

07:39.488 --> 07:41.890
it's a magazine. So he got called out to every big 
action to report it to the Typhoon magazine. And he

07:47.055 --> 07:51.319
went out to one deal one time where There were so 
many bodies. You've heard the expression, you

07:53.441 --> 07:56.223
could walk across a field without stepping on the 
ground. You could walk across a field without

07:56.884 --> 07:58.926
stepping on the ground. He saw that with his own 
eyes. You didn't have to exaggerate. Anybody that

08:03.690 --> 08:14.180
exaggerates has got a personality defect because 
the stuff that happened was incredible enough

08:03.690 --> 08:14.180
without having to exaggerate. Little Bobby Beal 
was shot down one day. He took 17 rounds in the

08:17.783 --> 08:21.207
aircraft. One of them came up through the floor 
between his captain, Army captain in the back

08:22.788 --> 08:37.969
seat's feet, passed through the back of Bob's seat 
between his arm and his body, glanced off the map

08:22.788 --> 08:37.969
case that he was resting his arm on, which was 
attached to the door, and went up to the top of the

08:22.788 --> 08:37.969
windshield. Didn't touch anybody. 17 rounds, 
nobody hit. One round goes to an intake manifold,

08:42.014 --> 08:50.446
which cuts the power, makes the plane incapable of 
sustaining flight because they're so heavy. He

08:50.466 --> 08:51.668
was in the mountains. He was at 5,000 feet. He had 
time to glide down out of the mountains to an old

08:53.095 --> 09:01.685
abandoned French overgrown strip that has cows 
grazing on it. He's calling for help. By the time he

09:03.507 --> 09:07.451
gets down, there's so many aircraft waiting to 
help him, there's a traffic jam. There's more

09:07.571 --> 09:09.834
danger of mid-air collisions than there is enemy. 
And he builds up speed and buzzes the strip to run

09:11.696 --> 09:21.407
the cows off and then uses that excess speed to turn 
around and come in and land. Hits a cow with the

09:22.998 --> 09:26.823
gear, bounces off the cow, and lands. No damage to 
the aircraft other than the 17 holes. And they

09:31.890 --> 09:37.238
later on decided, well, in the next 10 years, 
somebody else might want to use this strip, so

09:31.890 --> 09:37.238
let's repair it and grade it. And the Army didn't do 
anything, anything, over there without checking

09:37.898 --> 09:46.130
for mines first on roads or strips or anything like 
that. They found five old mines that the cows had

09:46.150 --> 09:50.676
been grazing around and all that. He didn't hit, 
the cows didn't hit, nobody hit. So, I mean, weird

09:56.593 --> 09:57.294
things like that. My flare shoot was a weird deal. 
And you don't have to exaggerate. In a book we had to

10:03.981 --> 10:15.393
read for this class, Things That Carry, by Tim 
O'Brien, one of the interesting things that he

10:03.981 --> 10:15.393
says is every war story really doesn't have an end. 
Do you feel that that is true? Every war story

10:17.615 --> 10:18.957
doesn't have an end? What does he mean by that? Sort 
of, um... But it doesn't really always have an

10:21.301 --> 10:33.274
ending, but it kind of... Well... Do you feel like 
that for you, or do you think it's something you

10:21.301 --> 10:33.274
live with now, or do you feel like it's something 
that's passed? Oh, I see what you're saying. No, I

10:35.377 --> 10:39.621
think I still am affected by some of it. You know, 
some World War II veterans had it much rougher than

10:39.641 --> 10:46.709
anybody in Vietnam almost. POWs in Vietnam had it 
as rough as anybody. Which, by the way, was another

10:51.676 --> 11:08.714
thing that really set us off, was the way the POWs 
were treated, and the way some of our high-profile

10:51.676 --> 11:08.714
people, Jane Fonda, I will see a movie with Jane 
Fonda in it. I won't give her a dime of my money in any

11:08.734 --> 11:12.938
way, shape, or form. She is not apologetic for what 
she did. Clark Clifford, was it? No, who was it? Who

11:20.086 --> 11:21.227
was the other guy that went over there? former 
attorney general. Anyway, people like that, the

11:25.335 --> 11:35.110
people who were protesting the war may have been 
cowards, may have had conviction, I don't know.

11:35.130 --> 11:46.969
But people who went over there and consorted with 
the enemy

11:35.130 --> 11:46.969
ought not to be citizens of this country,

11:35.130 --> 11:46.969
period. And Jane Fonda's right up there. I mean, 
she sat behind an anti-aircraft gun aiming, you

11:51.818 --> 11:57.705
know, showing being filmed or having her picture 
taken as if she was aiming at U.S. planes. And she

11:59.247 --> 12:01.209
celebrated the U.S. planes being shot down. Now, 
that woman can rot in

12:02.691 --> 12:08.718
hell as far as I'm concerned. I don't think a lot of 
my generation knows. I think that they're really

12:13.544 --> 12:16.387
unaware. What... I think that there is so much 
literature and so much scholarly research after

12:17.570 --> 12:25.278
so many of the other words. And I feel like this war, 
not so much that it was secretive, but there's not a

12:25.298 --> 12:41.475
lot of scholarly or... Well, it was such a black 
period in our history that at first it was shoved

12:25.298 --> 12:41.475
under the table. People wanted to ignore it. Then 
when it came out that people were going to write

12:43.637 --> 12:46.800
more about it and have sort of a catharsis. A lot of 
the writings were from a point of view. They

12:54.266 --> 13:04.899
weren't really historical presentations, 
trying to be as accurate in reading the reports and

12:54.266 --> 13:04.899
getting into as much actual detail as possible. 
But rather, here's my point of view, and I'm going

13:04.919 --> 13:10.607
to write about this, and that's the way it was. 
Fields of Fire by James Webb, have you read that?

13:14.031 --> 13:16.254
One of the toughest books to read. Tough book to 
read. But as far as what he wrote about that I

13:18.640 --> 13:28.729
personally knew and that everybody that I knew 
that served over there that read it personally

13:18.640 --> 13:28.729
knew, it was 100% accurate. 100% accurate. I mean, 
tough book. And yet he may have been writing from

13:31.552 --> 13:43.964
his point of view and in your mind sometimes you 
remember things maybe a little more than what

13:31.552 --> 13:43.964
occurred or a little less than what occurred or a 
little differently than what occurred. I think I

13:43.984 --> 13:45.525
remember it pretty accurately, but I may not. 
Somebody else who was there with me might say, oh,

13:46.511 --> 13:50.894
no, John, that didn't happen that way. Same thing 
happens when my fraternity brothers and I get

13:50.914 --> 13:54.157
together and talk about our college days. And 
we've got some great stories there, too, but we

13:54.177 --> 14:01.023
remember them differently. Another book, I 
bought this book, and it's called Charlie Mike.

14:07.049 --> 14:14.415
And Charlie Mike is what, you know, the phonetic 
alphabet, Charlie stands for C and Mike stands for

14:07.049 --> 14:14.415
M. And we would use things like that in lieu of whole 
words or ideas. And Charlie Mike means continue to

14:22.118 --> 14:23.921
march. And when you're working with the lurks, 
they would call in on the radio and they'd whisper

14:24.661 --> 14:32.291
because they were afraid of getting heard by the 
enemy. And they'd describe what they'd heard. And

14:35.535 --> 14:40.381
you could tell by the pitch of their voice when 
they're really scared. The pitch gets higher. You

14:42.563 --> 14:43.845
can hear it. I could still hear it. And usually 
they'd get scared before there was anything

14:47.218 --> 14:52.545
really to be scared about. And the lieutenant in 
the back seat, or the captain in the back seat, who

14:53.887 --> 15:09.488
was controlling this suite, this operation, 
would hear what they had to say, and as often as not,

14:53.887 --> 15:09.488
he'd say, Charlie, Mike, please continue to 
march. They'd travel during the day, and then

15:09.608 --> 15:14.355
about 4 in the afternoon, They'd try to make sure 
they hadn't been observed and find a place to park

15:14.909 --> 15:24.922
for the night and stay there until after sun up the 
next morning and start moving out again. These

15:24.942 --> 15:27.426
guys, I mean, that was dangerous work. That was 
tough, tough stuff. They had to carry everything

15:29.368 --> 15:31.231
they needed. Water, which is the heaviest thing. 
They always carried more ammunition than they

15:33.374 --> 15:39.502
were authorized to carry and more weapons. They 
were incredibly strong guys. They'd go out all

15:41.204 --> 15:43.988
painted up, in broad daylight, and it's scary to 
run over one of them. And they'd go out there and

15:49.265 --> 15:56.292
look for these guys, and occasionally get in 
firefights, just them and a whole herd of North

15:49.265 --> 15:56.292
Vietnamese. And it was tough duty. But this book 
was about, written by a major who had been in

16:00.296 --> 16:05.722
Charlie Company's 75th Rangers. And he described 
three incidents in that book that occurred in my

16:12.622 --> 16:19.491
province while I was there, two of which involved 
me. And you could definitely relate. And I picked

16:20.893 --> 16:28.182
the book up on a whim and had one of those covers with 
a guy with bandoliers of ammunition across his

16:20.893 --> 16:28.182
chest, you know, and I thought, God, what a hokey 
book this is going to be. And it was. But he related

16:29.704 --> 16:39.076
things in that book that I myself had observed 
after a fashion afternoon. He talked about one

16:39.097 --> 16:42.561
part in the book where these guys are running 
through the jungle. with the North Vietnamese

16:43.030 --> 16:45.495
chasing them. Well, I had a team get jumped by a 
bunch of North Vietnamese and we had moved an

16:45.515 --> 16:50.805
artillery battery out. We blasted the 
mountaintop to clear the trees off and created a

16:51.326 --> 16:59.361
fire base and moved some 105 howitzers out there by 
helicopter. And so I was calling 105 fire in

17:00.684 --> 17:04.431
between the work team and the North Vietnamese 
trying to keep the North Vietnamese off their

17:05.238 --> 17:12.004
backs so they could get to an LZ to get extracted. 
And I couldn't see anybody. And these guys, the

17:15.147 --> 17:21.153
lurks, would tell me where my fire was coming by the 
shrapnel coming through the trees. And they'd

17:21.714 --> 17:23.896
say, you're getting too close. And I walked 
artillery behind them all the way to the LZ, and

17:23.916 --> 17:28.500
they got out. But an incident like that was in the 
book, which I thought was fascinating. We enjoyed

17:35.039 --> 17:38.404
working with the lurks. That was good. The 
communication was good. The communication was

17:41.989 --> 17:42.990
good. We had good relations with them. They did a 
good job and we got, we had a lot of success. Did you

17:50.481 --> 17:57.571
hear any stories from them or anything else about 
the tunnels or any? The bunkers? The tunnel rats,

17:59.814 --> 18:04.320
we never, I never experienced any tunnel rats in my 
area. You know, the GIs would go down in the

18:05.870 --> 18:11.015
tunnels, and that's scary stuff. I'm a little 
claustrophobic. I don't think I would have liked

18:12.316 --> 18:13.477
that at all. But they had, you know, the communists 
would put punji stakes in the tunnels, and they

18:13.958 --> 18:24.368
would put snakes and booby traps of all kinds. And 
that's not my idea of a good time. I'm glad I was a

18:29.212 --> 18:30.053
pilot.

18:33.556 --> 18:35.438
Another thing in that book... that I thought was 
really interesting was, he said it was a war

18:35.570 --> 18:41.458
without rules. It wasn't like a checkerboard 
where, one of the analogies, he said it wasn't like

18:41.898 --> 18:47.846
a checkerboard where they move, you move. It was 
without rules. Do you think that the United States

18:49.728 --> 18:56.837
was playing it like it had rules and the enemy 
wasn't? I feel that way very strongly. Like I said,

19:00.106 --> 19:02.769
we avoided civilian casualties as much as we 
could. Even when we bombed the North, we did

19:02.849 --> 19:06.073
everything we could to avoid civilian 
casualties. It's going to happen in any war.

19:09.497 --> 19:13.743
Friendly fire is going to happen in any war. We did 
our best to avoid it. We did play by the rules. You

19:19.470 --> 19:21.993
should not have those kind of rules. You should not 
give your enemy a sanctuary.

19:26.853 --> 19:34.441
We didn't have front line that we could if they 
mixed with the civilian population.

19:34.461 --> 19:39.686
I was up one night, and I was asked to put artillery, 
8-inch artillery, into a village. And I said,

19:40.828 --> 19:43.130
that's a civilian village. I mean, there's 
civilians in there. I'm not going to fire in there.

19:45.192 --> 19:48.796
And they said, no, the civilians have been pulled 
out the day before. You're cleared to fire. And I

19:51.519 --> 19:52.860
said, are you sure? And he said, not only am I sure, 
but if you look, you're taking tracers off for 6

19:53.667 --> 19:59.633
o'clock, green and white tracers. The enemy used 
green and white tracers instead of red. So once I

20:03.316 --> 20:07.700
had that assurance, I put artillery in the 
village. But we sweated and sprained to make sure

20:07.720 --> 20:12.705
that there weren't any civilians in there. The 
Koreans who fought with us in Vietnam didn't care.

20:17.029 --> 20:20.412
If they took fire from a village, they'd say, we did 
it. And if they didn't, tell them they'd line up

20:21.680 --> 20:26.084
their tanks, hub to hub, and drive over the 
village. The people better get out of the way. So

20:30.188 --> 20:33.551
yeah, we fought by rules, and war's a tough thing 
to... I mean, you've got to have some rules or

20:33.571 --> 20:38.235
you're not a human being anymore. But as far as 
sanctuary,

20:38.255 --> 20:43.760
that's silly. And the communists would use 
civilians. There was a... I called Ann one time And

20:51.768 --> 20:55.493
then I asked her about it again when I went to Hawaii 
to see her. A bus with nothing on it but civilians

20:55.513 --> 21:00.380
was blown up by a command detonated mine. Now that 
means that somebody has to punch the trigger. It's

21:04.126 --> 21:06.589
not one that you just run over and it goes off. They 
found the wires and everything. The communists

21:10.955 --> 21:15.922
blew up that bus to show that they controlled the 
road. They knew who they were killing. They did it

21:17.705 --> 21:19.227
as a matter of policy.

21:23.071 --> 21:24.513
We didn't do that. I asked Ann. I bet you that made 
the papers in the States, didn't it? She never

21:29.099 --> 21:29.679
heard of it. Didn't make the papers in the States. 
Communists doing atrocities, which they did all

21:34.065 --> 21:41.194
the time as a matter of policy, the press didn't 
care about that. Just what the United States did.

21:43.056 --> 21:45.800
And if the United States screws up, the press is 
supposed to point it out. I'm not saying they

21:46.380 --> 21:47.762
shouldn't. They shouldn't make it sound like we do 
it all the time, and they shouldn't ignore the fact

21:48.653 --> 21:53.320
that the enemy does it. That's one-sided. How many 
memories are acknowledged today? Talk about the

21:59.009 --> 22:04.538
Ho Chi Minh Trail, controlling the road. The Ho Chi 
Minh Trail was a sign of how incredibly

22:04.998 --> 22:10.527
disciplined the North Vietnamese were. They took 
trucks, but not only trucks, but bicycles and

22:12.184 --> 22:16.628
packs. It was like an army of ants going down this 
trail. We bombed the trail and they just moved

22:20.872 --> 22:23.795
around where we bombed. It was an incredible back 
and forth game. We did have a Chu Hoi in our province

22:27.938 --> 22:38.007
who, when asked why he surrendered, he said, well, 
it's like this. He says, I was in North Vietnamese,

22:39.228 --> 22:40.810
minding my own business. I get drafted into the 
Army. And he says, you know, all these guys are

22:43.633 --> 22:49.881
going south and none of them are coming back, so I'm 
pretty scared. But I'm given a load to take down the

22:50.041 --> 22:53.705
Ho Chi Minh Trail on the back. And he's a bunch of 
mortar rounds. And they would start this trail all

22:56.329 --> 23:05.259
the way down from North Vietnam carrying 
ammunition, and the fingers went out to all over

22:56.329 --> 23:05.259
South Vietnam. So his finger happened to go down 
into my province, Binh Duan Province. He says, I

23:10.278 --> 23:11.259
get down here. I'm months on this trail. I'm 
getting bombed. I'm getting rained on. It's

23:14.504 --> 23:15.165
miserable. I get down here. I say, here I am, and 
here's my mortar round. And the guy says, all

23:19.011 --> 23:20.233
right, great. Come on down here. And I go down this 
trail. The guy sets up a mortar tube, takes my

23:22.616 --> 23:27.643
rounds, fires them off, says, let's get out of 
here. We get out. He says, now go get some more. He

23:31.148 --> 23:34.573
says, that's not what I want to do. So he 
surrendered. He says, all I'm going to do is be a

23:35.735 --> 23:38.419
pack mule. I'm going to give up. But people gave up 
for different reasons. I will tell you, we killed a

23:41.273 --> 23:43.957
lot of Vietnamese. We killed a lot of North 
Vietnamese. When I first got there, they could not

23:47.161 --> 23:50.986
mount a serious offensive. Remember, I got there 
in May of 69. A year and five months or four months

23:54.251 --> 24:03.663
after Tet of 68, they could still not mount a 
serious effort because they were so decimated by

23:54.251 --> 24:03.663
Tet of 68. After I'd been there about six months, 
they were getting major North Vietnamese units in

24:03.683 --> 24:08.550
my province. And we killed a lot of them. How did you 
feel about, or how did people feel about the age? I

24:17.112 --> 24:19.434
know that they made a lot of children fight. How did 
they feel about it? Did they want to? The

24:26.520 --> 24:27.881
communists ruled by fear. They made up a policy of 
killing the village leaders and the teachers, the

24:28.962 --> 24:34.447
educated people. This is documented. They would 
take them out and kill them in front of the rest of

24:36.108 --> 24:39.111
the village. and say, if you don't do what we say, 
this will happen to you. Anybody that resisted

24:42.968 --> 24:50.038
them was shot in front of the rest of the village as a 
lesson. They scared most of these people into

24:50.058 --> 24:52.001
serving with them. It wasn't that they were all 
that dedicated. A lot of them were scared, and

24:54.043 --> 25:04.277
they'd get killed if they didn't serve, so why not 
go ahead and fight and have a chance of living than

24:54.043 --> 25:04.277
not do what they say and get killed.

25:07.662 --> 25:09.064
So that was common practice. practice.

25:13.300 --> 25:21.590
Quite often they'd get children who really didn't 
know any better to throw a grenade or something

25:13.300 --> 25:21.590
like that. And because we were so conscious of not 
killing civilians, a lot of GIs got killed because

25:21.630 --> 25:35.848
they hesitated, even though they saw a girl or a 
child carrying a weapon. They'd hesitate just

25:37.450 --> 25:38.511
long enough For

25:39.200 --> 25:44.185
them to get killed. That's a lot of the pictures you 
see. Yeah, a lot. So, you know, sometimes GIs got a

25:45.466 --> 25:51.251
little trigger happy after they've been shot at a 
few times by civilians. Or you'd see a civilian

25:51.271 --> 26:03.602
walking down a road and they'd walk like this, do a 
little movement around a certain spot, and they

25:51.271 --> 26:03.602
knew the mine was there. And they wouldn't tell the 
GIs, hey, there's a mine there. They'd just let

26:08.326 --> 26:08.987
them run over it. If you ever saw any civilian doing 
that, you immediately changed your

26:10.985 --> 26:17.954
mind. Anyway. Did you, um, what was probably the 
scariest

26:20.717 --> 26:26.585
moment? Well, the night in the mountains. I had no 
artificial horizon. It was inoperative. Had no

26:32.393 --> 26:33.895
radio waves navigation. You could tell where I 
was. My team was lost and in trouble. We flew into

26:40.642 --> 26:44.065
the valley, and the clouds were below the 
mountaintops. And you could tell the mountains

26:45.186 --> 26:49.931
from the clouds because the mountains were a 
little blacker. And the ranger in my back seat

26:49.951 --> 26:54.476
said, I think they're over this direction. And he 
had me flying up a little finger of the valley that

26:54.536 --> 26:58.239
the sides were closing in. And you get to a point 
where you can't turn around and get out without

26:59.180 --> 27:03.624
running into them. We just had a couple of 
helicopters hit the mountains and kill everybody

27:03.665 --> 27:08.269
on board recently. And so I was getting a little 
antsy, and I said, you know, A, I don't think

27:09.532 --> 27:16.919
they're over here, and B, I'm not flying up this 
valley anymore. And we found them 11 kilometers

27:16.939 --> 27:24.746
away and told them where they were and made sure the 
radio contact was established and everything was

27:16.939 --> 27:24.746
okay. And like I said, I would fly in and out of 
clouds, and all I had to orient myself was my

27:26.007 --> 27:36.737
altimeter and my airspeed indicator and my 
turn-and-back indicator. And I can't tell you

27:38.270 --> 27:41.455
today how I got out of there. Ann asked me one time, 
what was the scariest thing that ever happened?

27:44.440 --> 27:46.703
Was it the flare shoot? And I said, no, it was the 
night in the mountains. And I got all teary because

27:49.788 --> 27:55.637
I just don't know how I got out of there. But the 
flare shoot was pretty interesting. was firing a

28:00.460 --> 28:08.347
Stinger gunship, which is an Air Force C-119 with 
20mm Vulcan Gatling guns on. A compound of RFPF,

28:09.668 --> 28:16.354
Regional Force Popular Force, like a militia 
compound, had been hit. It was right on QL1, which

28:16.374 --> 28:27.323
is the main highway that runs north-south through 
Vietnam, or at this point it ran east-west because

28:16.374 --> 28:27.323
of the way the country is organized or outlined. 
And so, to the south, from this stretch of the road

28:30.498 --> 28:35.643
was the ocean, and they wouldn't try to get out 
there because they're too easily spotted. To the

28:36.744 --> 28:41.769
north were these stream beds that led up to the 
mountains to the Triple Canopy Jungle, and that's

28:36.744 --> 28:41.769
the way they would logically go. So I was flying at 
about 1,000 feet above the ground. The gunship was

28:47.115 --> 28:51.659
flying at 4,000 feet above the ground, and he was 
kicking flares out. I was flying in a racetrack

28:52.680 --> 28:57.265
south of the highway, and he was flying north of the 
highway in a racetrack. And I could see the ground,

28:57.734 --> 29:02.979
and I could actually adjust his fire into these 
screen beds. And I don't know if we got anybody, but

29:04.700 --> 29:08.984
that's the only thing you can do. Well, a dust-off 
helicopter, medical evacuation helicopter,

29:09.004 --> 29:18.993
came into the compound to pick up the wounded, and 
on another frequency asked for another flare. So

29:20.054 --> 29:27.201
unbeknownst to me, as I'm looking down at the 
ground, this guy flies, does a little jog, and

29:20.054 --> 29:27.201
kicks out another flare over the compound. So I'm 
flying heading east and looking out to the right at

29:28.666 --> 29:37.075
the ground north of the highway. And I look up and 
come to see a white blur in front of my nose. And what

29:41.260 --> 29:43.722
had happened was this flare had burned out. All the 
flares were burning out above my altitude. But as

29:47.226 --> 29:52.071
long as they were north of the highway, the wind was 
blowing them to the west. I'm sorry, the wind was

29:52.091 --> 29:53.993
blowing them to the east. I was flying west.

29:57.843 --> 29:59.585
They were out of my way. But on this one, it was right 
in front of me. And it was one of those instant

30:03.250 --> 30:05.553
recognition things. I knew what it was. And I 
jammed rudder and aileron and turned my head like

30:07.355 --> 30:16.366
this, sort of like a flinch when you know you're 
going to hit something. And if it had hit my prop, it

30:16.386 --> 30:19.430
would have been all over. But it hit my left wing. 
And the way these things are, they're a... 16-foot

30:23.881 --> 30:34.762
diameter canopy parachute with shroud lines go 
down to a ring with a quarter-inch thick steel

30:23.881 --> 30:34.762
cable from which hangs a big canister, rubberized 
canister that burns. And that's what creates this

30:35.283 --> 30:36.926
flare. And so I went like this, and apparently what 
happened was the thing went over the top of the wing

30:38.650 --> 30:46.024
that the parachute did, and ballooned or like a big 
air brake, and it snapped me to the left. At the same

30:51.432 --> 31:02.001
time, I heard this loud wham, and that was a 
canister swinging up underneath it, hitting the

30:51.432 --> 31:02.001
underside of the wing and left a dent about that, 
about three inches deep under the underside of the

30:51.432 --> 31:02.001
wing. And when I snapped to the left, I thought I'd 
lost a wing. And I jammed more rudder and looked

31:05.364 --> 31:11.690
over and saw that what I had was this big air brake. 
So I got it by holding all the rudder I could. My

31:14.352 --> 31:15.133
right leg was working like mad, I got it flying 
straight. And it slowed me down from my normal 90

31:20.244 --> 31:23.313
knots to 70. And yet at that speed, it's like...
