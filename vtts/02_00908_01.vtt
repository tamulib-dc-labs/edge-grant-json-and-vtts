WEBVTT

00:01.482 --> 00:06.487
office at the Austin Redevelopment Authority. 
Thomas is the executive director of this

00:07.908 --> 00:18.098
authority, and today is January 8, 1981.

00:19.600 --> 00:23.744
We are interviewing Thomas because of two 
reasons. One, he is the immediate past assistant

00:23.764 --> 00:31.371
planning director for the city of Austin, and two, 
is the current executive director of the Austin

00:31.790 --> 00:35.514
Redevelopment Authority. The topic of the 
interview is the planning process in Austin,

00:37.556 --> 00:58.337
going back as far in history as your personal 
experience will enable you to make accurate

00:37.556 --> 00:58.337
statements regarding events that have occurred 
that have been important and have influenced the

00:58.807 --> 01:03.614
process and the production of planned documents 
in Austin. So with that, Tom, we've got the list of

01:03.634 --> 01:08.781
preliminary questions in front of us. If you'd 
like to start with those that you are confident

01:08.861 --> 01:18.174
about and just simply bypass those that we can find 
through library research or whatever. Go ahead.

01:24.203 --> 01:29.732
The first issue, I guess, is what my personal 
knowledge extends to, and that's to 1975, five

01:24.203 --> 01:29.732
years ago. I have some knowledge, of course, of 
what happened prior to that, but personally

01:32.337 --> 01:38.508
involved in watching what's happened. I guess I'd 
say that, from my own experience, probably 1972

01:38.548 --> 01:49.907
would be the beginning of accurate statements, if 
you would.

01:52.165 --> 01:53.968
When you arrived from Texarkana. Texarkana. 
Okay, first legislative authorization,

01:55.870 --> 01:59.075
comprehensive plan. That's easy to check. I don't 
remember that. I think it's 1926.

02:09.349 --> 02:13.135
Most recent comprehensive plan approval 
occurred in 1977. Prior to that was 1961. 1961

02:16.099 --> 02:20.485
was done by a consultant. What

02:21.325 --> 02:33.401
we weren't sure about was who did the 1961 master 
plan. 1961 plan. It's published and so the author

02:35.764 --> 02:38.688
is shown.

02:43.073 --> 02:47.299
It's only been since 1977 as we look at, let's look 
at question three. The 1977 plan set forth

02:48.781 --> 03:04.322
policies for periodic review, and that's an 
annual review conducted by the Planning

02:48.781 --> 03:04.322
Commission, submitted to the City Council, and 
then reviewed, of course, by other commissions

02:48.781 --> 03:04.322
and boards in the city.

03:07.607 --> 03:15.818
Last night, in the 1980 review statement from the 
Planning Department's perspective was

03:07.607 --> 03:15.818
presented to the Planning Commission. So under 
that plan, there is an annual review and an

03:17.080 --> 03:30.376
analysis of performance, what they did and didn't 
do, and how the objectives are being reached or not

03:17.080 --> 03:30.376
being reached. Between the first two plans and 
when there wasn't any approved system of review,

03:30.977 --> 03:41.369
what was done to evaluate, let's say, the first 
plan? Very little. I'm not aware of any

03:43.952 --> 03:46.395
evaluations that occurred. The land use map was 
pretty well adhered to. There wasn't anything

03:54.956 --> 04:00.122
else in there other than some population 
projections and things, a typical 701 plan. And

04:02.065 --> 04:10.576
there was criteria in that plan for establishing 
industrial districts within the

04:02.065 --> 04:10.576
extraterritorial jurisdiction and things of 
that nature that were used. Once in a while there

04:12.818 --> 04:17.985
would be a revision in the master plan, and that 
revision generally dealt with that land use

04:12.818 --> 04:17.985
category. of what was an area for low density, high 
density housing, what area would be industrial or

04:18.910 --> 04:27.117
non-industrial. More or less minor revisions 
rather than entire concepts. Piecemeal.

04:31.761 --> 04:32.242
Exactly. And so 1970, 71 is when they first 
determined that that was insufficient and so a new

04:33.243 --> 04:41.790
plan was undertaken. Partially answered the next 
question, that is, Austin's comprehensive plans

04:41.810 --> 04:48.276
have been revised before. What was the process 
that took place in order to have this revision?

04:54.067 --> 04:55.529
We're speaking about the current one. In 1972, the 
city planning department, the planning

04:56.771 --> 05:07.264
commission, and I suspect at that time the council 
also, made a decision that they needed a new master

04:56.771 --> 05:07.264
plan. And it first started by the development of a 
goals program for what this community wanted

05:07.345 --> 05:17.638
itself to be, known as the Austin Tomorrow Plan 
program.

05:17.922 --> 05:30.974
went on for five years, with many, many meetings, 
and many, many technical reports, and a

05:17.922 --> 05:30.974
tremendous amount of citizen participation. The 
result of all that activity then brought forth a

05:30.994 --> 05:38.081
five-chapter master plan in 1977, which was 
adopted by Kelso. But it was a citizen-based,

05:39.922 --> 05:46.208
goals, objectives, policies master plan. We'll 
talk about the citizens action later, I imagine.

05:50.683 --> 06:01.695
As far as characterizing the planning style of 
Austin, would you say that it conducts

05:50.683 --> 06:01.695
comprehensive planning or one of the other 
various styles that cities use from time to time?

06:05.400 --> 06:11.346
The overall development of the master plan, the 
1977 master plan, was comprehensive.

06:13.709 --> 06:15.030
That went as far as goals and objectives and 
policies. And those were, as I said,

06:20.368 --> 06:24.413
comprehensive community-wide. The big issues, 
growth, development, style, shape of the city.

06:31.923 --> 06:37.089
Moving beyond that to specifics then, the city has 
done incremental planning. It has selected areas

06:37.109 --> 06:42.056
of the community, the Lake Austin area, and looked 
at that in a microcosm. It has looked at corridors,

06:42.736 --> 06:45.540
it has looked at creek, areas. And so one at a time 
they've been reviewed. And there's two of them

06:48.610 --> 06:50.333
under review right now. The plans are being 
developed. So it's been incremental in the sense

06:51.995 --> 07:03.492
of looking at different areas that are of a smaller 
scale rather than responding to different

06:51.995 --> 07:03.492
problems in that as they come along. It's usually 
incremental as far as area goes, different city

07:03.532 --> 07:06.737
areas. As far as the master plan itself is 
concerned, that's true. As far as the issues and

07:11.440 --> 07:15.725
conflicts that occur, those are case by case.

07:18.328 --> 07:20.250
When was the first zoning ordinance in Austin? I 
believe it was 1926.

07:25.156 --> 07:34.627
And that was done approximately at the same time as 
the legislative, as the city's comprehensive

07:25.156 --> 07:34.627
plan was approved then? Or shortly thereafter? I 
believe that's true. I don't have the documents

07:37.430 --> 07:39.793
anymore, but There was a master plan done in the 
1924-25 area.

07:48.581 --> 08:01.232
As far as administrative procedures and planning 
program elements, how does Austin, what does

07:48.581 --> 08:01.232
Austin use for implementing the community plan 
and different master plans that it's had

07:48.581 --> 08:01.232
throughout the broad area? Yeah, first of all of 
course it uses, it uses zoning. It uses

08:06.336 --> 08:10.540
subdivision control and

08:12.173 --> 08:23.625
to a great deal that uses its capital improvements 
program in selecting investment based upon the

08:12.173 --> 08:23.625
master plan and its provisions. There's been 
violations of that consistently in the past three

08:24.446 --> 08:29.130
years. But the master plan was intended to guide 
the CIP process. And in fact, the charter requires

08:37.519 --> 08:40.662
a provision that no CIP can ever be funded and no 
project undertaken which is in conflict with the

08:41.435 --> 08:47.201
city's master plan. Have there been any 
precedents where conflicts, project conflicts

08:47.221 --> 08:55.889
with the master plan and it has been brought to 
court then? No, they've not been to court. What has

08:57.330 --> 09:04.417
happened is that the master plan has been amended 
to remove the conflict.

09:04.437 --> 09:07.200
Then of course on the other side, projects have 
been dropped too. How has the organizational

09:08.541 --> 09:10.783
structure of the Austin Planning Department 
evolved and the planning process evolved over the

09:11.253 --> 09:16.880
years? Well, my experience, as I said, is 
relatively recent, maybe 1972. I don't know the

09:23.087 --> 09:26.571
arrangement. The charter provides that there be a 
planning director and a planning department and

09:27.152 --> 09:38.205
sets forth the basic responsibilities of that 
department. It's organized as a line department

09:39.113 --> 09:42.498
of the city of Austin. It's independent of public 
works, engineering, and all the others. The

09:46.985 --> 09:56.319
department head reports directly to the 
assistant city manager, and then ultimately on to

09:46.985 --> 09:56.319
the deputy city manager and the city manager 
himself. Its organization includes processing

09:58.161 --> 10:08.817
of subdivision flats and zoning, and then the 
development of long-range plans and special

09:58.161 --> 10:08.817
studies.

10:11.328 --> 10:21.007
What type of liaison is there between the Planning 
Department and the legislative body that it lends

10:11.328 --> 10:21.007
advice to that is, I imagine, Austin City Council? 
Well, the Planning Department is charged with

10:22.830 --> 10:34.112
support and staffing of the Planning Commission 
and the Historic Landmarks Commission. the

10:34.413 --> 11:04.352
actions taken by those two groups whom the 
planning department supports directly then goes

10:34.413 --> 11:04.352
to the city council the planning department 
represents those boards as well as its own

10:34.413 --> 11:04.352
opinions before the council but it does directly 
support those two commissions and then there's an

10:34.413 --> 11:04.352
ongoing goals committee group of citizens that is 
somewhat dormant today that meets periodically

10:34.413 --> 11:04.352
and the planning department provides some staff 
to them their purpose quite appropriately, at

11:04.653 --> 11:12.562
least in the 77 concept, is they're the watchdogs 
of the plan. Their charge is to review and keep

11:14.604 --> 11:23.614
track of what's going on in the city and make 
comments as to its applicability to the master

11:14.604 --> 11:23.614
plan. You mentioned earlier that citizen groups 
and action groups have played a great role in

11:23.634 --> 11:32.584
adoption of Austin's plan 2000, where one of the 
last master plans that have been adopted. Would

11:37.812 --> 11:40.514
you say they played a valuable role as far as input 
went? Did they have direct access to people in the

11:40.534 --> 11:43.597
planning department? Yes. Yes. In fact, prior to 
the Austin Tomorrow Program, citizen

11:45.198 --> 12:01.913
participation, I'm told, was independent groups 
and individuals who would state their cases to the

11:45.198 --> 12:01.913
Planning Commission and try to prevail when their 
issues were deemed to be important. With the

12:04.286 --> 12:27.900
coming of the Tomorrow Program, these were 
formalized and the city began to formally

12:04.286 --> 12:27.900
recognize neighborhood groups and chart 
territory under which they would be consulted and

12:04.286 --> 12:27.900
actually become a neighborhood activist and 
there's some 65 of those that have occurred and

12:04.286 --> 12:27.900
been chartered, if you will, recognized by the 
city since the Tomorrow Plan began. That went

12:29.534 --> 12:43.996
further now that any time a zoning change occurs or 
anything, the cognizant neighborhood group that

12:29.534 --> 12:43.996
is recognized by the city is given special notices 
to allow them to come and participate in those

12:29.534 --> 12:43.996
activities. Are those citizens groups rather 
structured and active? Or it would depend on which

12:49.184 --> 12:52.369
of the 65 groups I imagine you were dealing with. 
Some would have more of an active interest and some

12:52.409 --> 12:55.474
would be more passive. That's true. There are 
neighborhood groups that are not very active. The

13:01.023 --> 13:10.073
city requires for recognition that they have a set 
of bylaws, a membership, that they show that they

13:01.023 --> 13:10.073
are representative of the neighborhood they 
claim to represent. There is. Beyond that group,

13:12.676 --> 13:20.365
there is an Austin Neighborhoods Council made up 
of presidents or chairmen of each of these

13:12.676 --> 13:20.365
neighborhood groups. who bring a unified voice 
then to face the city council or others when an

13:21.239 --> 13:27.768
overall city issue is involved. Because on one 
level the individual is worried about his

13:27.788 --> 13:40.865
district, but through the neighborhood's 
council they are then able to deal with the overall

13:27.788 --> 13:40.865
city issues like capital improvements programs, 
utility policies, and things that affect

13:27.788 --> 13:40.865
everyone. I would imagine from the type of 
association that that is, that is on a

13:40.885 --> 13:48.495
neighborhood level, that there can be quite a bit 
as far as special interest goes to a neighborhood

13:48.745 --> 13:56.976
and it would be hard for any one of the presidents to 
have any kind of community-wide interest. Has

13:57.016 --> 13:59.880
this been a problem as far as citizen input goes? 
The Neighborhoods Council has been most active in

14:02.263 --> 14:16.642
providing a forum and additional support for an 
issue that faces one or two neighborhoods. As an

14:16.983 --> 14:17.824
example, a certain particular zoning or 
transportation proposal may impact negatively

14:18.597 --> 14:28.549
one neighborhood but be beneficial to three or 
four others. They provide a forum among

14:28.589 --> 14:33.835
themselves to come up with either rational 
compromises or present a unified front. They do

14:34.777 --> 14:42.726
and are expected to be very suspicious and very 
serving of the neighborhood they're in. But

14:43.908 --> 14:45.870
neighborhood issues such as CIP and where we have 
elections and that. They act as a sounding board

14:49.709 --> 14:55.215
and a compromise group to come up with an overall 
plan. They've been effective in that. They've

14:56.276 --> 15:08.470
also provided a training ground for people who 
seek council or commission appointments because

14:56.276 --> 15:08.470
they get to know the issues from their 
perspective. Now the neighborhood groups have

15:08.490 --> 15:12.735
been characteristically antagonistic of 
business. because they represent the

15:14.521 --> 15:21.589
residential sector of the community and not the 
business sector of the community. Even those that

15:21.609 --> 15:28.436
are in leadership positions in citizen groups are 
typically amateurs when it comes to planning.

15:28.456 --> 15:30.298
They have an idea of what their interests might be. 
They may even have an interest in what Austin's,

15:30.318 --> 15:38.207
may even have some good input on what Austin's 
future ought to be. But in the case where

15:39.008 --> 15:43.853
professional planners can see that their input is 
for their own benefit and short-sighted, for one

15:44.086 --> 15:50.011
example. Is that overridden by people in the 
planning department or is it still taken into

15:50.632 --> 15:58.880
account when the advice is formulated? Well, 
Austin may again be unique in some respects

15:59.660 --> 16:13.553
because many of the people who are in leadership 
positions in the neighborhood groups do carry

15:59.660 --> 16:13.553
professional planning credentials. They have 
the education, experience, and many are employed

16:15.187 --> 16:22.154
in professional planning organizations.

16:24.316 --> 16:34.145
When they present an issue or wish to testify on a 
particular zoning case, subdivision, or

16:24.316 --> 16:34.145
whatever, their comments are their own. They do 
not gain particular credibility with the city

16:35.247 --> 16:43.995
staff because the staff has its own position that 
it must, and it does, project The Planning

16:45.258 --> 16:56.162
Commission then reviews, and here's testimony 
from many people, they independently make their

16:45.258 --> 16:56.162
position, the city staff makes its own, and 
there's no filtering of that. There may be

16:58.186 --> 17:02.676
conflict, and that has happened in many cases 
where the staff has felt for other good reasons

17:03.415 --> 17:08.542
that that was an inappropriate decision or 
inappropriate position. They'll so state in

17:08.822 --> 17:10.444
theirs. The neighborhood group makes its counter 
proposal and then the Planning Commission and

17:10.965 --> 17:15.170
Council make a decision. That's been 
characteristic of Austin.

17:20.237 --> 17:26.505
Cities in Texas have each had their own unique 
history in Austin, especially since it's been the

17:20.237 --> 17:26.505
capital of the state. And there are several events 
that can be followed as far as to draw some kind of

17:31.816 --> 17:34.740
comparison between cities in Texas. And several 
events will have played different roles as far as,

17:34.780 --> 17:42.151
and the role of planning within those events can be 
significant. Austin was founded in what year?

17:45.035 --> 17:45.635
1839. And that was, was it originally planned or 
plotted out? It was plotted out under the Republic

17:50.122 --> 17:57.412
of Texas to be the capital of the state. There was no 
town in existence when it occurred. Was it a state

18:00.014 --> 18:05.600
body then that did the original platting or was it 
done by a consultant or an individual? It was done

18:06.541 --> 18:11.107
by a surveyor hired by, I believe, Sam Houston. But 
at that time, Texas was a republic, an independent

18:11.127 --> 18:14.330
nation. And the charge from the history of this 
community was that they had chosen the site

18:15.391 --> 18:28.266
central to the entire state and decided that the 
city would be here and then the

18:30.170 --> 18:32.072
the elected groups to the Republic. The President 
of the Republic then selected the surveyor who

18:33.114 --> 18:44.728
laid out the original city, which was a mile 
square, which we're sitting in right now. I

18:46.651 --> 18:55.502
imagine other cities in Texas that were already 
established at the time and already might have had

18:46.651 --> 18:55.502
claims to be the capital had some there was some 
conflict as far as creating a new city that was to

18:56.174 --> 19:03.183
serve as the capital republic. Is that true? Well, 
in 1839, I believe the largest city in Texas was San

19:04.305 --> 19:09.532
Antonio.

19:14.358 --> 19:17.142
At that point in time, there were few cities, 
obviously. It was a totally frontier state.

19:20.506 --> 19:24.932
Having just gone through the 1836 Alamo, the fight 
for independence from Mexico. It was a frontier

19:27.991 --> 19:30.093
state. So, there was to be a capital, there was not 
to be a fight from existing cities. And so the

19:38.002 --> 19:46.691
agreement was that there should be a capital 
central to the state, accessible to all of its

19:38.002 --> 19:46.691
citizens, that did not put one city against 
another. And I believe the records indicate that

19:50.056 --> 19:53.381
it was the general consensus that a new city be 
formed and that it be done. And of course after

19:54.022 --> 20:00.211
looking at many sites around the state, this was 
the site that was chosen. Have there been any

20:00.231 --> 20:08.303
significant city or county or state fairs or 
exhibitions held in Austin where planning has had

20:00.231 --> 20:08.303
a significant role?

20:13.210 --> 20:14.031
I'm not aware of any. Austin has always been the 
capital, but I'm not aware of any particular of

20:20.026 --> 20:22.429
centennials or anything that occurred here. I'm 
sure there was a centennial in 1939, but I'm not

20:22.469 --> 20:26.774
aware of what it was. How about major conventions? 
Has Austin been a site? Austin has not been a site of

20:31.119 --> 20:33.221
major conventions. It has, because of its size, 
has not been able to attract, primarily because it

20:33.301 --> 20:41.711
has a lack of hotel facilities. It has adequate 
more than adequate transportation access, but

20:43.972 --> 20:55.774
the Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly told us 
that the lack of hotels, and of course there's no

20:43.972 --> 20:55.774
convention facility to hold a large convention in 
Austin. People have gone to San Antonio and Dallas

20:56.095 --> 20:57.918
before. Is that an element that is addressed in the 
master plan? Is that something that's desired as a

21:01.465 --> 21:04.090
goal? to grow to the size where that kind of 
operation could be feasible and conventions

21:04.272 --> 21:09.840
could be attracted. There have been several 
elections in this city to propose the

21:10.661 --> 21:23.399
construction of a modern, large convention 
facility to take advantage of this location and of

21:10.661 --> 21:23.399
course the state capital itself. There has been 
expressed a great deal of support for having major

21:24.120 --> 21:29.487
conventions in Austin if the facilities were 
available. In 1972, I believe, is the year in which

21:31.036 --> 21:38.505
an election was placed before the voters to build a 
convention facility, and it was defeated. There

21:38.525 --> 21:42.369
has been continual discussion since that time. It 
has been widely discussed throughout all the

21:42.589 --> 21:47.615
business and residential communities. But to 
this date, there has not been a successful vote to

21:48.536 --> 21:52.581
do that. You mentioned earlier that Austin did not 
exist, and it was selected as a site for the

21:54.523 --> 22:00.570
Capitol. Can you tell me what other functions in 
those frontier days Austin served other than

22:00.905 --> 22:10.419
being the capital let's say for commerce, trade, 
or transportation or that? Well, when it was

22:12.341 --> 22:19.892
chartered as a city, Austin didn't serve any 
economic function. It was a governmental seat,

22:19.912 --> 22:23.157
pure and simple. It was a stage line. between San 
Antonio and North Texas and on up to St. Louis and

22:26.318 --> 22:32.086
that area. There were instances of some fringes of 
the cattle drives from South Texas, but not very

22:33.048 --> 22:49.851
many, because the cattle trail was east of, it was 
east of Austin, from the South Plains up through

22:33.048 --> 22:49.851
Amarillo, Abilene, east and west. I was thinking 
west. Yeah, some east, some west. The Fort Worth

22:55.141 --> 22:58.765
Railhead of course was east coming out of the Cape 
Ranch area. Then the very far south and west Texas

22:59.666 --> 23:06.575
groups through Abilene and on up into Kansas and 
Omaha and places like that. But to my knowledge

23:06.595 --> 23:11.841
until the coming of the railroad there was no great 
economic activity here. It was a water supply

23:12.882 --> 23:21.833
sufficient to support a community and it was 
centrally located in the state. What impact did

23:21.853 --> 23:24.456
the coming of the railroad have on Austin? And what 
relationship did it have to other Texas cities as a

23:25.094 --> 23:28.698
railroad hub? Well, the railroad killed cities in 
Texas by bypassing some. It made others by making

23:34.484 --> 23:37.968
them new places for commerce. For Austin, as I can 
see it, it never had a tremendous economic benefit

23:39.730 --> 23:45.936
because we weren't a railhead. We were not a great 
agricultural area either. It provided another

23:50.356 --> 23:55.224
means of transportation to and from the state 
capital to conduct the state business. That's

23:56.706 --> 23:59.211
about the extent that I would know. Was there any 
increase in state business as a result of the

23:59.231 --> 24:06.222
coming railroad or expansion of state government 
in relation to that? Well, as the state grew, I

24:08.306 --> 24:11.571
think the railway The railroad was one indication 
of the growth of the state and the importance of the

24:11.770 --> 24:21.843
state capital, and it may have been a solution to 
the symptom that was already occurring as the

24:11.770 --> 24:21.843
state was growing. As you look around, of course, 
since 1886, the new state capital, which was built

24:23.845 --> 24:33.357
after the original one burned, There's been 
continual expansion of state government, and it

24:34.079 --> 24:50.042
has been a, up until today anyway, the state of 
Texas has chosen to centralize its offices in

24:34.079 --> 24:50.042
Austin, unlike other states who put its major 
offices in many different cities. Texas has not

24:51.064 --> 24:52.666
yet done that. They have discussed it. I don't know 
if they're planning to do it, but to date, all of the

24:54.168 --> 25:00.137
headquarters of all of the state agencies are all 
right here.

25:04.201 --> 25:09.269
Texas, Austin has always been dependent upon the 
state as an employer. Let's talk briefly about the

25:10.450 --> 25:15.838
federal government, specifically military 
influences in Austin. Can you tell me if the World

25:17.340 --> 25:27.095
Wars have had a significant impact on planning in 
Austin due to, let's say, new military bases and

25:17.340 --> 25:27.095
influx of population resulting, or housing? I 
don't think they have, though. Prior to World War

25:31.437 --> 25:38.367
II, the only significant military establishment 
was Camp Mabry, which is the home of the Texas

25:31.437 --> 25:38.367
National Guard. And it has not had a tremendous 
influx of anything. It was a reservation set aside

25:46.498 --> 25:50.063
for that many, many, many, many years ago. World 
War II, the Bergstrom Air Force Base was created

25:51.044 --> 25:57.293
outside the city, at a pretty good distance from 
the city. We've only now grown to encompass it.

26:00.108 --> 26:06.275
There has been housing that has resulted as that 
base has come up and gone down, and some of South

26:00.108 --> 26:06.275
Austin reflects that. But if you say major today in 
relation to 500,000 people living in the area,

26:07.616 --> 26:16.045
there is no dominance of military installations. 
So even in the case of the latter Air Force Base,

26:16.786 --> 26:28.478
planning conducted by Austin City did not need to 
consider the consequences of military

26:16.786 --> 26:28.478
population? coming into the area? It does not 
appear that they have because we have the state

26:29.937 --> 26:37.567
highway system serves that facility. That was 
outside the domain of the city. The development of

26:41.932 --> 26:58.093
residential areas in proximity to that Air Force 
base have resulted in severe noise impacts which

26:41.932 --> 26:58.093
indicates that there was a somewhat of an 
ignorance of the effect of that base on what it

26:41.932 --> 26:58.093
would do in residential land. And right now we have 
significant noise impacts and problems in the

26:59.813 --> 27:11.687
East Austin area as a result of the operation of 
military jets.

27:11.707 --> 27:21.858
During the 1930s, during the Great Depression, 
New Deal financing as a result of New Deal programs

27:11.707 --> 27:21.858
had a great impact on Texas cities. Can you tell me 
what impact, from what you know, WPA and funding

27:22.338 --> 27:29.346
for planning and development had on Austin during 
that time? I don't know about any planning and

27:30.136 --> 27:32.780
development that occurred. The city hall was 
built during that era. It is a WPA project. The

27:38.327 --> 27:39.990
federal courthouse is another.

27:44.556 --> 27:46.339
I'm not aware of too many other specifics. We do not 
have any flood control districts that I'm aware of

27:46.839 --> 27:56.012
like San Antonio River that was a WPA project. I'm 
not sure what the system for the dams of the

27:56.032 --> 27:59.417
Highland Lakes was about.

28:02.232 --> 28:20.169
Something that you're well versed in and probably 
address is the impact of urban renewal in Austin

28:02.232 --> 28:20.169
and what role the city has played as far as having 
people write grants and use available federal

28:02.232 --> 28:20.169
funding as a resource for stimulating local 
development. Could you say something about that?

28:23.292 --> 28:26.776
Austin was extremely active in the urban renewal 
programs. It had five urban renewal, very

28:26.796 --> 28:31.480
significant urban renewal projects. Today there 
are two of which have not yet totally been

28:32.776 --> 28:36.861
completed. It was a major development activity 
that led to the expansion of the Capitol Complex.

28:44.611 --> 28:48.676
It was a major development activity that led to the 
expansion of the University of Texas. It was a

28:50.098 --> 28:56.165
major development activity that led to the 
beautification and saving of Waller Creek. And

28:57.507 --> 28:58.969
then in East Austin, There are three areas in which 
it had a tremendous impact on the removal of slums

28:59.135 --> 29:07.046
and blight and replatting in the typical sense. 
But there are some unique factors in the Austin

29:08.448 --> 29:14.517
Urban Renewal Program that are not generally 
known even by Austinites. Among those, the LBJ

29:15.839 --> 29:20.606
Library is located on urban renewal land. The 
expansion of the university, the Super Drum,

29:20.646 --> 29:27.015
Brackenridge Hospital, all of those lands were 
made available through the use of the urban

29:27.805 --> 29:34.594
renewal power, which is very, very significant. 
It has recently come to light that there have been

29:34.614 --> 29:41.945
problems with accountability of funding that 
Austin has received from the federal government.

29:44.728 --> 29:49.355
What do you see as the prospect for urban renewal 
and federal funding in Austin City? As a result of

29:49.555 --> 29:54.522
that, how has planning been affected by the 
problems that Austin has had recently? Well, the

29:55.970 --> 30:08.568
Urban Renewal Program, of course, expired in 
1974, so the possibility of a rebirth of urban

29:55.970 --> 30:08.568
renewal is remote unless new federal legislation 
is prepared. Funding problems today result in the

30:10.591 --> 30:14.777
Community Development Program. The lack of 
funding currently, it's not been a long period,

30:15.659 --> 30:24.171
four or five months without funding, have 
resulted in the impairment of rehabilitation

30:24.539 --> 30:30.409
programs to assist neighborhoods in keeping 
those neighborhoods viable living

30:24.539 --> 30:30.409
environments. They've had some effect on 
planning, but not very much. The planning

30:34.857 --> 30:44.013
function in the city of Austin has been 
self-sufficient and supported by the city itself

30:34.857 --> 30:44.013
and has never really depended heavily on federal 
funds for its operation. As far as projects that

30:47.827 --> 30:50.951
planners have envisioned for Austin that have 
been affected by this? What kind of

30:50.991 --> 30:58.462
accommodations are being made to adjust goals and 
timeframes?

30:58.482 --> 31:05.251
Well, you're talking about the cut off the funds or 
the... There don't appear to be any

31:05.271 --> 31:11.460
adjustments to be made, really. The majority of 
the funds that have been cut off affect housing

31:12.160 --> 31:17.648
rehabilitation, which is an ongoing, forever 
problem. There have not been, because of the

31:18.775 --> 31:26.787
restrictive use of the funds, any great new 
community-wide type projects that were planned

31:18.775 --> 31:26.787
using these funds. So it's not had an effect on 
those. The funds are restricted in their use

31:28.990 --> 31:32.074
anyway. There has been ongoing planning, 
continues to be, for I think the convention

31:32.094 --> 31:37.862
center. There's been discussions of a new city 
hall. There's ongoing development on Town Lake.

31:44.232 --> 31:48.698
All of that's privately and publicly supported, 
apart from any federal funding. But there is a

31:49.437 --> 32:00.308
significant impact when you consider that five or 
six months of rehabilitation activity has had to

31:49.437 --> 32:00.308
stop, and that affects hundreds of families.
