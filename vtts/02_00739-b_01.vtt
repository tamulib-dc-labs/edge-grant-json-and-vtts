WEBVTT

00:02.225 --> 00:10.414
there, Dean Stangle, and we won that contest in 
Fort Worth. So were you also a member of the junior

00:11.675 --> 00:14.478
livestock fishing team? The junior team then, 
what, did that stay in Texas? Well, yeah. Well, we

00:20.385 --> 00:23.188
judged at Fort Worth and at Oklahoma City. 
Oklahoma City. And the senior livestock? Well,

00:26.932 --> 00:30.696
the senior team judged the International in 
Chicago. But did you have to go to Fort Worth and

00:31.013 --> 00:33.718
Oklahoma City? You just went to Chicago, huh? 
Yeah. Had to fire for that team, too, you know. So if

00:40.950 --> 00:43.594
you made the junior team, you weren't 
automatically on the senior team. That's right.

00:44.997 --> 00:49.023
Were there ever anybody other than the animal 
husbandry majors on the team? Not in those days,

00:49.204 --> 00:53.511
because, well, they They didn't take enough 
courses in law taught judging to where they made it

00:53.677 --> 00:58.445
anyway. But I think now, I think that's changed 
now, I'm not sure. Mostly though, it's having 100

01:03.773 --> 01:06.257
students. Because they take a lot of courses in, 
they don't call it judging anymore, I think they

01:06.277 --> 01:15.853
call it evaluation or something like that. This 
morning I took a little bit of time and read the

01:16.610 --> 01:21.335
history of your class that's in the 22. Daniel 
Longhorn. Longhorn, yes. And there was something

01:25.679 --> 01:28.102
in there that I didn't fully understand. This 
would have been during your junior year, and this

01:29.783 --> 01:42.496
mission was made of some kind of an embarrassing 
incident that was, you know, possibly would

01:29.783 --> 01:42.496
reflect adversely upon both the school and the 
student body. And the Whoever wrote the class

01:45.449 --> 01:54.041
history said something to the effect that the 
class of 22 did right and everything went on OK. I

01:54.923 --> 02:00.791
suspect that that might have had something to do 
with hazing, but I don't. Well, it might have had

02:00.811 --> 02:03.335
something to do with the junior banquet.

02:06.279 --> 02:09.123
I think they cut out the junior banquet about in 
that time. This would have been the 2021 year, I

02:09.143 --> 02:13.870
think. The junior bankers got pretty rough 
sometimes. It was the,

02:18.078 --> 02:26.771
they'd always tried to, they didn't know who the 
tool smasher was gonna be and they wouldn't

02:18.078 --> 02:26.771
announce it. But the other boys would try to find 
out and if they, and they'd get who they thought it

02:27.692 --> 02:36.825
was gonna be and take him way out here in the woods 
somewhere and keep him to learn at the bank. Now you

02:36.845 --> 02:38.347
say they, who was they? Well, all the other 
students. The other three classes? Yeah. What was

02:45.001 --> 02:48.085
the purpose of the junior banquet? Just a social 
function? Yes. But this was something attended

02:51.569 --> 02:56.414
only by members of the junior class or did they 
bring guests also? Yeah. We had, we were talking

02:59.278 --> 03:07.387
about entertainment in those days, I guess our 
dances was our biggest social entertainment.

03:07.407 --> 03:14.856
We'd have our ROT, the Ross volunteers always had a 
dance and The junior class would have dance,

03:15.157 --> 03:19.223
sophomore, freshman. They'd have final ball and 
all that kind of stuff. And they were quite popular

03:25.332 --> 03:30.840
because we had to import our girls, you see. Either 
from other schools. Where did they stay then?

03:33.924 --> 03:39.693
There were a lot of houses on the campus in the profs 
and these profs would keep them. Because at that

03:39.713 --> 03:42.437
point there was no hotel in town, no motel. No, they 
stayed with the profs. Earlier, in a sense, before

03:46.055 --> 03:58.732
we turned on the machine, you were telling me 
something about an incident involving Senator

03:46.055 --> 03:58.732
Parr and one of his sons. Could you start over? 
Well,

04:02.577 --> 04:08.785
Senator Parr's son, George Parr, was going to 
school here. And he went over and told me that there

04:09.386 --> 04:13.311
was hazing going on over here. And Senator Parr had 
a committee. formed over there, and they come over

04:16.193 --> 04:22.421
here to inspect and look into it. And they told the 
commandant to have those boys that George told

04:22.441 --> 04:32.513
them was being hazed to go down to the hospital and 
be inspected. So when they come, they could have

04:33.174 --> 04:37.359
them up for the committee. And of course, Dr. Zell, 
they told him when it's coming and all. So Dr. Zell

04:40.643 --> 04:42.965
got a student body together and told them about it. 
Told them to put on their their good manners and

04:45.590 --> 04:51.715
treat them like gentlemen. And of course the kids 
knew what that meant. That meant to really put on

04:55.058 --> 05:00.963
the red carpet. And of course everybody traveled 
by train those days when the committee came down to

05:00.983 --> 05:07.649
the depot to get off while they was met there by the 
band. And the band played the march while they

05:07.669 --> 05:14.134
marched up to the YMCA where they had this meeting. 
And when Archie Parr started acquitting these

05:16.488 --> 05:22.257
boys after he put them on their oath.

05:25.802 --> 05:26.924
He couldn't get much out of them. He asked the boy, 
he said, were you hazed? He said, no. He said, now

05:30.409 --> 05:32.933
son, you're on the oath. It'll be hard on you if you 
don't tell the truth. He says, I ask you again, were

05:35.857 --> 05:37.539
you hazed? He said, no, sir, I wasn't hazed. Well, 
he said, what are those black and blue stripes on

05:39.282 --> 05:43.288
the back of your rump for it if you hadn't been hazed 
that you were expected down there at the hospital.

05:48.305 --> 05:56.318
He said my roommate and I were exchanging licks 
last night and they never made a thing out of that

05:48.305 --> 05:56.318
but George had to leave school. Do you remember 
what year that was? I believe 1920. 1920.

06:03.850 --> 06:07.015
One other student of an earlier had mentioned 
something about some hazing in which some

06:07.433 --> 06:17.206
students were dropped from school, and it was 
involved the son of a state senator. I was

06:17.266 --> 06:19.069
wondering if it might have been. Well, it could 
have been. Well, I don't think it was this one,

06:20.491 --> 06:34.029
because that was Hans Brody, class of 17, who was 
involved in that incident, and that was probably

06:20.491 --> 06:34.029
another state senator's son. Well, you know, 
there were a lot of boys come here, in those days,

06:37.538 --> 06:39.561
and they didn't stay. They didn't like it. You 
know, a school like this at that time, I guess same

06:42.685 --> 06:49.533
way now, but I liked it myself. But a lot of boys 
didn't like it, and so they left. You've probably

06:56.322 --> 07:07.056
heard of, out of the class, if 100 boys came here, 
freshmen, only about half of them graduated

06:56.322 --> 07:07.056
seniors, or maybe less. And they all, the rest of 
them, either changed schools or dropped out of

07:07.542 --> 07:11.467
college, won. I don't know where they went. But,

07:17.275 --> 07:24.284
you know, some boys like some schools, some don't. 
I think the way you were raised before you got here

07:24.344 --> 07:28.729
had something to do with it. Yeah, I'm sure it did. 
You said you were accustomed to hazing. I was

07:32.474 --> 07:33.796
accustomed. I had three brothers older than I was, 
I think. They wasn't too kind to me. And another

07:37.809 --> 07:47.978
thing, I had to milk a cow every night for supper and 
every morning for breakfast when I was at home.

07:48.858 --> 07:54.724
Came down here and ate supper without even milking 
a cow, ate breakfast without milking a cow. I

07:54.764 --> 07:58.027
thought I was really going to town. You really had 
to make that. Yeah. OK. Oh. One or two incidents

08:04.732 --> 08:13.460
that happened while you were here, and I just 
wanted to see if you had anything to add to them.

08:16.563 --> 08:18.525
Well, one happened before you came. That was the 
famous branding of the University of Texas

08:18.585 --> 08:21.668
mascot. 13 to nothing, yeah. 13 to nothing. I 
didn't remember anything about that. Well,

08:26.393 --> 08:30.096
somewhere we had picked up some information. 
Matter of fact, we have an invitation. that was

08:33.200 --> 09:00.304
sent out apparently by some people in Austin to a 
banquet in Austin and it's January 22nd and the

08:33.200 --> 09:00.304
best we can figure out this was 1920 and that was 
inviting people to this banquet in Austin and it

08:33.200 --> 09:00.304
was a barbecue and that's supposed to have been 
barbecued Bevo and we had some other indication

08:33.200 --> 09:00.304
that Bevo was slaughtered and the hide was tanned 
and and split, and A&M got half, and Austin got, UT

09:00.757 --> 09:05.084
Austin got half. Have you ever had any? No, that's 
all news to me. That's all news to you. Well, there

09:09.871 --> 09:18.645
was a newspaper clipping, and maybe the 
invitation was a fake. I mean, maybe it was a joke.

09:19.727 --> 09:20.588
Yeah, it could be. But we've been told that the 
Beagle never made a public appearance again after

09:21.069 --> 09:26.016
he was branded. Uh-huh. So, uh. Well, I know the 
boys, you know, they tried to get the mascot. I know

09:34.021 --> 09:37.147
they went out and got the owl one time. But I think 
Dr. Dell didn't take that back.

09:42.718 --> 09:48.469
Yeah, see, we talked a little bit about what you've 
done after you graduated, and we want to talk some

09:42.718 --> 09:48.469
more about that. You indicated the first year you 
came back and and worked on a master's, and then you

09:51.685 --> 09:56.109
worked for the railroad for a while, and then you 
came back to A&M in 25. Stayed until I retired in 65.

09:58.051 --> 10:03.876
But we want to talk a little bit more about what you 
did while you were here. We don't want to just skip

10:03.896 --> 10:06.218
over it and say that. Well,

10:06.238 --> 10:19.870
until they combined the Extension Service, 
Experimentation, and College in one unit, I was

10:06.238 --> 10:19.870
with Experimentation 100%. And so I was with the 
research from 1925 until they combined it about

10:20.272 --> 10:28.022
1946. In 1947 I came over here and I was half 
teaching and half research. And when I was doing

10:36.955 --> 10:47.629
research,

10:36.955 --> 10:47.629
we got interested in problems that that our

10:48.723 --> 11:01.920
farmers and ranchers and other citizens were 
interested in, like a cottonseed meal for pigs.

11:02.701 --> 11:10.090
Before

11:02.701 --> 11:10.090
I got started in that, we had a

11:18.406 --> 11:21.830
This is a book on pork production. When I studied in 
school,

11:21.850 --> 11:34.463
and here's how I'd have to answer that question to 
get a hundred on it when I was in school. I'd get zero

11:34.483 --> 11:35.684
on it today. Cutting seed meal is poisonous to 
swine. That's the way you learned it in school.

11:39.748 --> 11:44.253
Well, that last sentence there. It is poisonous to 
swine if you talk about it. Mm-hmm. Doesn't it say

11:48.258 --> 11:52.262
no way it's been found to feed it to swine? Well, 
see, as now prepared cottonseed meal is poisonous

11:52.282 --> 12:01.450
to swine, all the various proposed ways for safely 
feeding this meal have failed under careful and

11:52.282 --> 12:01.450
continued tests. Yeah. Pigs thrive at first on the 
meal, but usually in from four to six weeks, some

12:02.371 --> 12:06.675
die. Not all is a rule, but so many that all possible 
profits from the use of this feed are lost. Yeah.

12:13.661 --> 12:17.725
Now, read this right here, then. cotton seed meal 
may be fed safely. As a result of much research and

12:22.580 --> 12:29.386
many practical experiences, it has been shown how 
cotton seed meal may be used in swine rations

12:22.580 --> 12:29.386
safely. Hale of the Texas Station, in a 
comprehensive series of experiments from 1924 to

12:30.747 --> 12:44.019
1928, demonstrated that it could be fed safely to 
all classes of hogs when certain restrictions as

12:30.747 --> 12:44.019
to amount and conditions were observed. Well, 
that That did us a lot of good. I was proud of A&M, you

12:49.832 --> 12:54.740
know, to come out of A&M College. I put A&M above me. 
It's interesting how

12:59.288 --> 13:12.450
things...

13:15.147 --> 13:22.896
when you're in school, what you, some things 
you're told that is true at that time, but may not be

13:15.147 --> 13:22.896
true tomorrow. Now you take this, I don't know 
where you've heard of this vitamin A work we did on

13:23.537 --> 13:28.262
pigs or not. Just briefly, that I knew you did some. 
But before we did that, the literature, all this

13:30.585 --> 13:43.500
basic science of literature says that a birth 
defect is a result of hereditary factor. In other

13:47.438 --> 13:52.507
words, if she was born with some birth defect, it's 
due to genetics. Well,

13:53.969 --> 14:07.412
uh, we came, we got to working on the vitamin A and, 
uh,

14:12.370 --> 14:23.013
And

14:12.370 --> 14:23.013
our work was reviewed by a lot of people. Here's one 
by Dr.

14:23.073 --> 14:29.567
Hogan of Missouri. He tells something about that 
there.

14:41.800 --> 14:55.232
What we showed was that

14:41.800 --> 14:55.232
the birth defects may be caused by environmental 
factors as well as by hereditary factors. And the

14:56.033 --> 14:59.316
environmental is anything that's not 
hereditary. And this thing here is put out by the

14:59.336 --> 15:07.804
University of Copenhagen at Denmark. And they 
have verified our work. About 30 years later,

15:11.635 --> 15:15.181
you'll see this published in 1966. And we gave our 
first talk.

15:27.101 --> 15:37.238
Our first talk was over here in Atlantic City at the 
American meeting of ophthalmology.

15:41.335 --> 15:48.626
And they, when they put out this issue, they put our 
talk was the first one in the journal.

15:51.870 --> 15:57.819
Relation

15:51.870 --> 15:57.819
of vitamin A to antifamilies from pigs. That's

15:58.500 --> 16:03.608
small eyes. But what it really showed that it 
produced not only blindness, but a lot of other

16:11.609 --> 16:15.635
birth defects. And now that, here's a picture of a 
normal pig's eye.

16:24.370 --> 16:25.351
That's a normal pig's eye. And there's a pair of 
abnormal pig's eyes. And here's a hair lip, cleft

16:28.556 --> 16:34.005
palate, cyst, And the exterior light grows at the 
base of the ear. And we just, that just showed up

16:37.425 --> 16:41.089
everywhere. And then the signs started taking 
this up everywhere. And they've been like in

16:46.275 --> 16:51.600
Denmark here, trying to verify that, you know, or 
just prove it. And here is the yearbook of

16:52.541 --> 16:56.706
pediatrics, 1934. And they put a picture of our 
pigs in there and told about it. And then...

17:05.373 --> 17:11.722
quoted

17:05.373 --> 17:11.722
our work about 10 different years. Here she is, 
Paladin. She sent this to me. And there's a

17:15.949 --> 17:20.215
different page that she's got referred to our work 
here on this. So I think if we did anything called as

17:22.298 --> 17:33.895
any good, that cut and seam meal work and this work 
was not only accepted here in this state, but

17:34.499 --> 17:40.086
nationally, internationally. Like, here's what 
she says right here on page 90, and then all these

17:40.106 --> 17:48.756
other pages here. But she came up with the same,

17:48.776 --> 18:00.270
when she gave her studies, started her program, 
she got the same thing that we got. Our first letter

18:01.685 --> 18:03.427
was born in 1932. Also,

18:03.887 --> 18:24.406
the Texas Medical Association invited us to give a 
talk up there at Fort Worth in 1937.

18:27.008 --> 18:30.932
And they put it on the radio. But there's

18:31.486 --> 18:43.180
a few things we did like that that

18:31.486 --> 18:43.180
I was awfully interested in research. And of 
course, I was interested in teaching, too. But I

18:45.843 --> 18:51.270
was in research for over 20 years before we did it. 
Let me back up and ask a question about the

18:51.550 --> 18:57.257
cottonseed business.

19:00.123 --> 19:09.574
Why were you trying to figure out how you could feed 
cottonseed meal to pigs? Was

19:11.296 --> 19:16.743
it you were trying to find a use for a commodity? Oh 
yeah, you see that was a Texas cotton. The cotton

19:20.507 --> 19:29.117
was a big crop for Texas and 1500 pounds of picked 
cotton give you a bale of cotton of 500 pounds and

19:29.722 --> 19:33.526
1,000 pounds of seed. And that seed is processed in 
the oil and cottonseed meal. And then it's fed to

19:38.512 --> 19:39.774
livestock. And people keep asking me, why can't we 
feed cottonseed meal to pigs? And I went through

19:46.782 --> 19:49.966
the literature like that book there. It says you 
can't feed it. And that's what I was taught. So I

19:54.271 --> 19:57.855
went to the library and started checking up on 
the... data that they used to come to that

19:58.291 --> 20:01.013
conclusion. And I found data where they're 
feeding as much as 30% cottonseed meal to pigs, and

20:01.774 --> 20:07.839
then came to that conclusion. Well, so I just asked 
myself a question, was I could say that about salt.

20:14.825 --> 20:19.129
If I fed 30% salt in the ration, that salt's 
poisonous to pigs and you can't feed it. So I set up

20:20.250 --> 20:27.336
my own project, experiment, and started out with a 
lot with no cottonseed meal in it, and then the

20:27.839 --> 20:34.026
other feed that took the place was tankage, a 
protein supplement called tankage. And then I

20:34.846 --> 20:47.040
took out a little tankage and put in 3% cotton seed 
meal, then another lot, 6% cotton seed meal, 9%

20:34.846 --> 20:47.040
cotton seed meal, 12% cotton seed meal, and 15% 
cotton seed meal and no tankage. Well, the reason I

20:48.341 --> 20:53.486
stopped at 15, that balanced the ration as far as 
protein is concerned. And so as long as I didn't go

20:53.506 --> 20:56.850
above 9% cotton seed meal, I couldn't tell those 
pigs from the growth rate and efficiency of feed

20:57.421 --> 21:06.733
utilization from the ones that didn't have any 
cottonseed meal. And that's why we wrote it up that

21:06.753 --> 21:10.157
way. And then people started getting on that

21:10.437 --> 21:16.665
to try to verify that. And they came up with the same 
results we did in Nebraska and other places. So

21:20.610 --> 21:23.553
that you had an abundance of cottonseed meal. 
Yeah. And you needed to find a use for it. Well,

21:25.703 --> 21:28.167
farmers asked me, I want to feed some cottonseed 
me. Why can't I feed cottonseed me to the pigs? And

21:30.470 --> 21:38.623
since we was out here in charge of the swine 
laboratory, well, they thought we ought to do some

21:30.470 --> 21:38.623
work on that. And the Texas Cottonseed Products 
Association asked us to do a little work on that.

21:46.495 --> 21:54.647
And we came up with that bulletin, and then now 
every every bulletin that's published from now on

21:55.387 --> 22:02.497
out when it comes to cottonseed meal, or if you're 
near Marsden's Feeding Feeder or anything,

21:55.387 --> 22:02.497
quotes our work on that. Well, I take it that 
cottonseed meal itself has a... it's a protein.

22:09.486 --> 22:09.806
Yes. And so, therefore, it should be beneficial, 
but what you then have to do is find out what

22:10.007 --> 22:22.103
proportion of it... Well, cottonseed meal is 
as... Cotton seed has a toxic substance in it for

22:22.977 --> 22:27.162
pigs called gossypo. And the reason they call it 
gossypo, the OL signifies it's a phenol or

22:27.963 --> 22:34.870
carbolic acid compound. And the gossy comes from 
gossypium, which is a botanical name for cotton.

22:39.175 --> 22:40.216
So they call it gossypo. And gossypo will kill 
pigs, no doubt about that. So we later then set up a

22:45.042 --> 22:50.908
test to find out how much gossypo a pig could 
tolerate. And it's .01%, that small amount. And if

22:54.935 --> 22:57.458
you get over that, you're going to kill the pig. But 
when you don't go over 9% of your ration as a

22:58.920 --> 23:06.008
cottonseed meal, you'll never have any trouble 
with gospel. So the ration then was composed of

23:07.890 --> 23:14.818
like 9 or less percent cottonseed meal, and then 
what, grain? Grain and tankage. or anything else

23:17.163 --> 23:18.605
you want to put in there. If you can't have 
something, it's a meat scrap or soybean meal or

23:18.625 --> 23:27.635
something to add up the protein to the level it 
should be.

23:28.816 --> 23:31.259
So what, the level of the protein should be what, 
30%? Well, depending on the age of your pig. Now, a

23:33.181 --> 23:40.650
pig at weaning time needs about 18% crude protein 
in the ration. But a 200-pound pig, it needs only

23:41.311 --> 23:46.697
about 12% to 14% protein. Brood sows in a 
supplement period need about 15% crude protein.

23:53.720 --> 24:08.024
And we fed this cottonseed meal to brood sows and 
all stages of pigs, fed to boars, growing and

23:53.720 --> 24:08.024
fighting pigs, and brood sows in the gestation 
period and in the lactation period. So was

24:09.046 --> 24:13.714
cottonseed meal then was a more economical It was 
cheaper, yes. It was cheaper than tankage or

24:15.511 --> 24:19.515
something else that would provide protein. When 
you added two together, well then you had a better

24:19.535 --> 24:23.318
protein supplement anyway.

24:26.221 --> 24:26.361
Uh-huh. And then you say your other primary 
development was the vitamin A studies for pigs.

24:37.171 --> 24:44.258
How did you come to work on that project?

24:44.727 --> 24:50.653
The literature is full of information on the need 
of animals for vitamins, even humans and

24:44.727 --> 24:50.653
everybody. And so the direct experiment station 
here asked the different divisions to write up a

24:51.854 --> 25:11.976
project for their dairy cattle and beef cattle and 
pigs and poultry and all on the vitamin studies.

25:12.917 --> 25:14.278
And we picked vitamin A. for pigs because all of our 
farm grains are deficient in vitamin A except

25:15.220 --> 25:27.251
yellow corn and we don't, Texas is not over 
abundant in yellow corn, we have grain sorghum and

25:15.220 --> 25:27.251
grain sorghum doesn't have any vitamin A. So we 
thought that we should determine the amount of

25:28.653 --> 25:44.788
vitamin A a pig needs and the sources of this 
vitamin A and the effect of vitamin A on the

25:28.653 --> 25:44.788
gestation period of the sow and lactation period 
all this. And then as we went along, we uh, we wanted

25:46.555 --> 26:11.105
to, we picked gilts, or females, for our study 
because we wanted to know what effect it had on the

25:46.555 --> 26:11.105
estrous period, or the heat period of the gilt, and 
the number of pigs she had, and how she gave milk for

25:46.555 --> 26:11.105
them, and what the pigs had, the growth effect, the 
growth of the pigs, all that. Well, we had one here

26:15.447 --> 26:24.760
to

26:15.447 --> 26:24.760
get out and couldn't get up. We had to give her some 
cod liver oil. Of course, we knew enough about the

26:27.063 --> 26:44.948
vitamin A from the literature that one of the 
symptoms of vitamin A deficiency in pigs is that

26:27.063 --> 26:44.948
they can't walk straight because the nerve 
controls locomotion is degenerated. And they

26:45.383 --> 26:50.810
walked behind legs, they'd cross them this way, 
and they'd act like they were almost drunk. And so

26:52.211 --> 26:57.318
when she got that way, well, they gave her some cod 
liver oil, and she got all right. And then a

26:57.458 --> 27:08.612
little later when she was down, before she got this 
far down, we bred her. And then she got down 30 days

27:09.813 --> 27:13.838
later, couldn't get up, so we gave her cod liver 
oil. And then when she had litter of pigs, well,

27:15.185 --> 27:18.970
they were all blind. Well, we knew how we'd been 
treating this sow, so we decided then maybe we'd

27:20.192 --> 27:32.089
better set up the test to deplete the sow's vitamin 
A storage in her body, which there's a lot of it in

27:20.192 --> 27:32.089
her liver and other organs. And then when she's 
depleted of her vitamin A storage breeder and keep

27:32.890 --> 27:45.107
her on this depletion for 30 days longer, that's 
when the facial eyes and the other facial cells

27:32.890 --> 27:45.107
develop in the embryo. And so we'd give her a lot of 
cow liver oil and it would be too late to repair

27:45.863 --> 27:51.131
this. And we kept producing. Every time we did 
that, we'd get blind pigs. So we came to this

27:57.440 --> 27:59.483
conclusion. We had to prove it genetically. We 
know that vitamin A is necessary for you to

28:04.630 --> 28:08.075
normalize the function. If you don't take vitamin 
A, you're going to have night blindness and things

28:08.115 --> 28:12.481
like that. So the question actually comes to you, 
If vitamin A is necessary for the normal eye to

28:14.618 --> 28:22.972
function, is it necessary for the development of 
the eye in the embryo? And that was the question.

28:26.899 --> 28:37.697
And then you set up that premise, then you start 
your feeding and your experiments to prove

28:26.899 --> 28:37.697
yourself wrong or right. And so...

28:43.306 --> 28:54.884
We published all

28:43.306 --> 28:54.884
this thing in the Journal of Heredity. And

28:57.067 --> 29:06.862
this organization here then got a hold of that and 
read that. It was also published in the American

29:07.143 --> 29:10.528
Society of Animal Production. And so they asked us 
to prepare a paper for this meeting here. And I sure

29:17.357 --> 29:32.441
did feel humble and not prepared to do this because 
I was just 35 years old and I knew I'd be up there with

29:17.357 --> 29:32.441
people from Harvard and Yale and all that place. So 
I went over to see my director and talked to him

29:32.461 --> 29:38.811
about it because he was very They were very proud 
that we'd get an invitation to a thing like that. He

29:44.713 --> 29:48.639
says, Fred, you just stay with the data you've got. 
And if they ask you questions that your data

29:48.980 --> 29:57.393
doesn't cover, just tell them that your data 
doesn't cover that question. And say write it in,

29:58.475 --> 30:03.282
what you got on your data, and say they'll never get 
you in a hole anywhere. And it worked just exactly

30:03.302 --> 30:05.946
like that.
