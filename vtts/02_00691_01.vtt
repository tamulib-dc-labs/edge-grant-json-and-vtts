WEBVTT

00:02.427 --> 00:15.886
Today is November the 23rd, and I'm interviewing 
Dr. Don F. Seaman, professor of

00:02.427 --> 00:15.886
interdisciplinary education and also head of 
that department, has been in Texas A&M since 1971.

00:17.108 --> 00:31.708
We're going to talk a little bit about perceptions 
and changes that have come about at Texas A&M since

00:17.108 --> 00:31.708
you arrived, which was very shortly after the 
college was born in 1969. Who was responsible

00:17.108 --> 00:31.708
primarily for you coming to A&M? Probably,

00:33.933 --> 00:40.022
you mean at the university or elsewhere? At the 
university, for coming to me. Well, Don Clark was

00:41.885 --> 00:49.075
the individual who interviewed me and talked to me 
over the phone and asked me to come for the

00:41.885 --> 00:49.075
interview. And then because of certain 
circumstances, I had decided not to come. Then Don

00:58.655 --> 01:08.506
was the one who got on the phone and called me back 
and told me those circumstances had changed, and I

00:58.655 --> 01:08.506
agreed to come over the phone once we negotiated 
salary. Okay. And since your arrival at Texas A&M

01:08.646 --> 01:25.223
in 1971, what are some of the major changes that you 
have perceived in, you know, political,

01:08.646 --> 01:25.223
sociological, philosophical, whatever, and 
what do you think caused these major changes?

01:26.044 --> 01:26.925
First was growth. Okay. In 1971, when I came, A&M 
had 14,000 students. And much of the growth in the

01:33.119 --> 01:36.785
70s was in the College of Education. This put a lot 
of pressure on us for space and faculty. And that

01:43.395 --> 01:54.852
caused some change, because I think the nature of 
the college changed from kind of a balanced

01:43.395 --> 01:54.852
college to one of undergraduate teacher 
education emphasis. Then I think some new

01:55.912 --> 02:08.845
programs, science education was one, adult 
education and vocational ed, educational

01:55.912 --> 02:08.845
technologies are all new programs that started 
since 71. So I've seen the influx of a balance of

02:09.806 --> 02:20.497
those kinds of things and a mixture. I think the 
college was a bit more narrow in scope In 71, I think

02:24.667 --> 02:37.486
the demands of the public for various kinds of 
programs have caused the college to broaden its

02:24.667 --> 02:37.486
scope and maybe its mission. Wasn't voc ed already 
in there? Is that a new program? I thought vocation

02:41.412 --> 02:43.014
had a close way back. Started in 1971. What was it 
before? Was it called something else, or was there

02:46.019 --> 02:50.425
not any vocational training at all? No, I think 
industrially it was there. Over in... What was it,

02:53.894 --> 02:56.338
engineering technology or someplace? Right, 
okay. So there was no vocational education?

02:58.020 --> 03:03.930
Vocational education was created in 1971 through 
the, what was that act? EPDA. Right, I think Dr.

03:05.772 --> 03:07.836
Boone mentioned that. And through a bunch of 
fellowships that they got in 71. Okay, so that's

03:10.460 --> 03:12.883
relatively new. Well, then Gronemann was with 
industrial ed. Yes. All of these were part of the

03:15.848 --> 03:17.991
other, okay. Yeah. Okay. And, okay, growth is one. 
Is there some other? I could say the broadening of

03:22.683 --> 03:27.327
the scope of the college with the various kinds of 
programs. What

03:27.347 --> 03:33.252
were the major causes for this? Was it just the 
demand of people? I think the college meeting the

03:37.255 --> 03:40.518
needs and demands of the public. To what extent, 
then, do you feel that the college has been

03:42.920 --> 03:52.268
achieving its mission, which is very broadly 
defined as teaching, research, and service, What

03:52.957 --> 03:58.142
is the balance in those, say, in your area, the 
emphasis? I would say in general, the college has

03:58.222 --> 04:04.028
been meeting the teaching and service aspect 
probably more than the research. One or two

04:06.631 --> 04:09.153
departments probably have been meeting all 
three. But I'd say the balance has been mostly in

04:11.015 --> 04:16.360
teaching and service at this point. In your own 
personal, through your time, how do you balance? I

04:23.011 --> 04:31.701
mean, what, for example, time-wise percentage, 
you know, what percentage of your time do you do

04:23.011 --> 04:31.701
teaching service-oriented activity or 
research? Well, about 40% to 50% of my time right

04:31.721 --> 04:35.005
now is administration. Oh, OK. Is that true of most 
department heads? Oh, I would say so. It surely is.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.334
And I've got a small department. The bigger 
departments, probably it's even more than that. I

04:44.576 --> 04:45.798
don't know. I teach a course each semester, 
usually. 101 a semester.

04:51.597 --> 05:02.213
I try to publish somewhat regularly and

04:51.597 --> 05:02.213
probably give more time to service than I should, 
but it's difficult to turn it down. And are you very

05:04.556 --> 05:11.206
active also in organizational things, like your 
professional organizations? Not quite as much as

05:13.129 --> 05:14.631
I was. I was president of our national 
association. That took an awful lot of time. For

05:17.655 --> 05:20.119
three years, that was a three-year commitment. 
But now I've backed off and do sometimes each year.

05:24.372 --> 05:30.579
Is that encouraged within the college to do a lot of 
professional association? The dean told me he had

05:30.599 --> 05:34.805
just come off being president of the association. 
He said take whatever time it takes because it's

05:34.845 --> 05:42.094
important and do it. How do you feel that this 
tremendous growth that you just talked about has

05:43.976 --> 05:49.583
affected the work that you do with students? Well, 
our program has gone from nothing in 1971 to about

05:50.508 --> 05:54.553
130, 140 students. Wow. And it loads the faculty. 
Our off-campus program takes some of our time and

06:00.760 --> 06:12.953
effort also, but that is a very good recruiting 
device and gets some very good quality students

06:00.760 --> 06:12.953
that way. So it does require more time for teaching 
and service, at least less time for research, It

06:21.001 --> 06:22.063
doesn't have to be that way. For example, this 
semester I'm using students in my classes to start

06:22.163 --> 06:26.469
collecting some initial data. They're field 
testing questionnaires for me that I'm going to

06:26.509 --> 06:32.739
use for collecting data in my own research 
probably this spring. So that can be done if it's

06:33.420 --> 06:38.047
part of the class assignment carries out real 
well. I think you can plan and do it. But we've had

06:42.634 --> 06:47.321
two professional journals in our department in 
the last five years. And that's a lot of service.

06:50.093 --> 06:54.459
Takes a lot of time, but those kind of things bring a 
lot of prestige to the university. A lot of people

06:54.479 --> 07:00.487
in my field know where Texas A&M is and who's there 
that never paid attention to it before. And I think

07:00.868 --> 07:02.430
that's meaningful. You're talking about the 
Lifelong Learning Journal and what's the other

07:02.450 --> 07:04.933
one? And the Adult Literacy and Basic Education 
that Felons and Conte had for about five years

07:04.953 --> 07:12.163
before they left. Those are two of our three 
journals. So when you came then, what did you

07:15.267 --> 07:17.991
come... What department were you a part of? 
Educational administration. I was assigned to Ed

07:24.801 --> 07:26.363
Ed for three years. Bob Fellins and I were assigned 
there for three years. And I really believe that

07:31.231 --> 07:39.083
Dean Hubert felt that once our soft money ran out, 
that adulthood would probably dry up and blow

07:31.231 --> 07:39.083
away. We wouldn't be here any longer. But we filled 
in. We went out and started working the field. And

07:43.850 --> 07:46.915
at the end of three years, we had a substantial 
number of students. And voc ed still had those

07:47.840 --> 07:50.924
fellowships and some students. So we were put 
together with Ray Perkins, who was then in iEd. We

07:57.432 --> 08:01.057
were all assigned to interdisciplinary ed, and we 
started functioning like a department. In what

08:01.558 --> 08:02.078
year? 74, fall of 74. Don Clark was the acting 
administrator of the department, acting

08:06.344 --> 08:11.571
coordinator. And it was called ID&E from the 
beginning? Okay. It was Ray and Bob and myself who

08:19.534 --> 08:21.897
became the 3X. Then we began to add. Okay. And now 
you have how many faculty? Well, there are five in

08:28.845 --> 08:33.771
adult education and six in educational 
technology, all in IDED. Plus, we use faculty

08:35.072 --> 08:39.277
outside the department to teach courses and chair 
committees. They're not adjunct. They're just

08:41.020 --> 08:42.842
people we use. Do you have a limit on how many 
committees your people can chair or what? How do

08:47.577 --> 08:48.378
you handle that? On doctor level, we try to limit it 
to 7 to 10. Masters, we don't have any limitation.

08:57.528 --> 09:00.411
So because you're dealing, you don't have any 
undergraduate, right? No. So because you're

09:01.532 --> 09:09.601
dealing with the graduates, this latest influx of 
students into the college is not having a

09:01.532 --> 09:09.601
tremendous impact on your dealing with students, 
right? No. Because you're still going to have the

09:09.701 --> 09:10.983
same. It does because educational technology 
teaches those service courses. And it has a big

09:15.472 --> 09:20.938
impact because those classes are always full and 
students are trying to tear down the doors to get

09:15.472 --> 09:20.938
in. It's their last semester before student 
teaching. They don't take it now. It's going to be a

09:25.162 --> 09:28.625
delay and all those sob stories. But they're real. 
And I sympathize with them. But it does have an

09:32.109 --> 09:33.751
effect on us. Do you see any collaboration or much 
collaboration among departments within the

09:34.932 --> 09:42.019
college or outside the college?

09:44.800 --> 09:45.621
I see some. For example, IDED and EdEd collaborate 
on off campus in San Antonio, and now IBTE also. We

09:53.933 --> 09:54.854
register together. We counsel students into each 
other's programs and each other's departments

09:55.816 --> 09:59.721
and classes. We try to find out where the 
individual's needs are best met and advise

10:02.065 --> 10:08.794
students to go into that department as best we can. 
There are a few joint research projects going. Not

10:13.825 --> 10:16.488
many that I know of, not as many as there probably 
should be. And there are several proposals that

10:17.369 --> 10:22.314
are going to have faculty from different 
departments on them. So there's some of that, yes.

10:25.277 --> 10:27.860
But there could always, there could be more. There 
could be much more, yes. What about the College of

10:29.201 --> 10:34.627
Education in collaboration with other colleges 
and universities? Are you aware of who? We had two

10:35.448 --> 10:41.875
faculty who had a joint research project with 
Agriculture Economics. in studying the learning

10:42.985 --> 10:46.570
styles of the undergraduate students. So that 
went on for about a year. But that's the only one

10:52.197 --> 10:55.501
that I know of. When I was part-time ag extension, I 
did something at College of Agriculture. When

10:59.326 --> 11:01.108
were you that? Oh, from about 1976 to about 1983, I 
guess. You were part-time ag extension? I was

11:10.900 --> 11:12.182
quarter-time ag extension. How did that come 
about? They needed some help in their staff

11:15.212 --> 11:18.195
development and didn't have enough. And I had been 
a member of Ag Extension, so it seemed like a good

11:18.215 --> 11:24.880
thing to do. And did you teach? Were those classes 
or things that you did on campus? Those were

11:27.803 --> 11:37.711
non-credit workshops off campus and going out and 
training field staff in Extension, doing some

11:27.803 --> 11:37.711
workshops on campus at state conference. Did you 
like that? Enjoyed it very much. That's where I got

11:42.098 --> 11:43.980
my positive strokes. Because people didn't have 
to take those. They took them because they wanted

11:46.663 --> 11:47.784
them. So if people were there, I knew it was because 
they liked it. I have a lot of secrets. What are your

11:56.993 --> 12:02.899
perceptions of how outsiders view the College of 
Education at Texas A&M?

12:06.242 --> 12:11.127
People within the state who have dealt with it seem 
to have a pretty high regard for it. I think some of

12:11.883 --> 12:23.637
this, I think much of it comes from the quality of 
students we're turning out, both undergraduate

12:11.883 --> 12:23.637
and graduate, and from some of the things some of 
the faculty have done in the state, some workshops

12:11.883 --> 12:23.637
and conferences and those kinds of things. I think 
they've seen some quality there. Now, outside of

12:27.081 --> 12:31.866
the state of Texas, I don't know. OK. Do you have a 
vision of what what the College of Education is

12:35.137 --> 12:44.830
going to be in the 21st century and right now on the 
undergraduate level, especially there's a lot of

12:35.137 --> 12:44.830
upheaval and a lot of potential changes. Is it 
going to affect your area very much? I don't know.

12:52.359 --> 12:57.606
One thing I keep hearing about is a move towards 
certification in adult education. If that comes

12:58.888 --> 13:04.435
about, the form of it and the scope of it may have a 
direct effect upon us. What is that? I have not

13:06.043 --> 13:06.624
heard. Move toward certification. Certifying 
adult education teachers and administrators in

13:08.105 --> 13:10.768
the state. They don't have anything right now? 
They don't have to be certified at all? I have

13:14.532 --> 13:17.035
fought that since I've been at Texas A&M. I have 
seen what form certification takes in other

13:17.836 --> 13:21.320
states, and I think it's worthless. A couple of 
classes, that doesn't mean anything. And often

13:25.224 --> 13:27.387
the classes they're taking don't do them any good. 
So you're against it? I'm against it unless

13:30.070 --> 13:34.675
somebody comes up with something that guarantees 
it's going to make a better person by certifying

13:30.070 --> 13:34.675
them. But just taking a couple of classes in adult 
ed doesn't mean anything. That's what

13:38.696 --> 13:40.618
certification is in a lot of states. If it's 
something meaningful and useful, yeah, I would

13:43.220 --> 13:45.943
support it. So do you have any idea what's going to 
happen with the College of Education in the near

13:48.746 --> 13:53.651
future? I think right now we're at the dictates of 
the legislature and coordinating board and a lot

13:54.312 --> 13:59.176
of other entities. We're kind of being buffeted 
about. Instead of being proactive, we're in a

14:03.005 --> 14:10.616
state of reactivity right now because it's just 
the way it is. Is that the norm in most colleges of

14:12.299 --> 14:16.886
education? They don't have time to be reactive? 
I've been in three colleges, student and faculty,

14:18.528 --> 14:22.674
and that's the way I've seen it. Always proactive. 
Always reactive. Reacting to crises. So your

14:28.363 --> 14:31.307
department is still growing, though? Well, not 
anymore. We pretty well put a cap on it. For the

14:36.834 --> 14:39.098
number of faculty we have, we've reached our 
limit. And we will not admit probably any more

14:39.358 --> 14:47.049
students than we graduate in the future unless we 
get increased faculty. Is there a chance that you

14:47.069 --> 14:48.832
will get increased? We've asked for one, but we'll 
see what the budget does.

14:55.842 --> 14:56.983
So when was this cap? Was this cap, I mean, is it a 
formal cap, or is this kind of an understood? Our

15:01.342 --> 15:05.267
admission standards are higher, and we're 
turning down more applicants. What about the

15:06.088 --> 15:07.489
admission standards? What are they, and how do 
they differ from some of the others? Well, they

15:10.913 --> 15:22.166
consist of a combination of experience, graduate 
record exam scores, GPR, professional

15:10.913 --> 15:22.166
commitment, professional goals. All these are 
determined by what we call an admissions

15:23.808 --> 15:29.475
assessment form that each student must complete. 
which includes a VEDA and asking and answering

15:30.063 --> 15:33.907
several questions. Sometimes we'll call them in 
for an interview, and occasionally we'll find

15:33.928 --> 15:40.195
that our department won't serve their goals or 
professional goals.

15:44.500 --> 15:47.283
What is the GRE requirement right now? We like to 
see 450 on each, the verbal and quantitative.

15:51.007 --> 15:52.649
Minimum 450 on each of those. Analytical has a 
little meaning for us, but not too much.

15:59.847 --> 16:02.911
Does each department determine their admission 
standards? Yes, each department determines its

16:02.931 --> 16:04.253
own. We have a minimum of three years of relevant 
experience before we'll admit anybody onto the

16:04.794 --> 16:12.124
doctor.

16:12.144 --> 16:13.907
Can you talk a little bit about the highlights? 
You've been at A&M now for... Highlights of what?

16:17.592 --> 16:22.559
Of your career there, your years at A&M, something 
that has happened or that you feel good about.

16:22.899 --> 16:27.205
Included in that can be some of your own 
contributions as well as insights or anecdotes.

16:28.062 --> 16:31.207
Well, the highlights have been the faculty I've 
been privileged to work with. I think we've had

16:31.408 --> 16:34.974
some excellent faculty all across the college. I 
can name several, but I won't. I had some wonderful

16:39.201 --> 16:42.907
experience with graduate students. I've seen 
students come in and go out and assume positions of

16:42.967 --> 16:51.141
leadership that I just never would have dreamed 
possible. One individual, he was a A Meek student

16:54.978 --> 17:03.353
counselor, school counselor in San Antonio is now 
a training director in a hard-nosed industry in

16:54.978 --> 17:03.353
Houston. Never would have believed she could have 
done that, but they love her. She's just really

17:06.919 --> 17:08.101
good. And some others who are deans and directors 
and so forth that I think have just made wonderful

17:09.343 --> 17:20.783
contributions that make your life very 
worthwhile. I think winning the faculty

17:22.282 --> 17:27.689
achievement award in continuing education was 
one of my highlights. Is that the former students?

17:29.371 --> 17:30.452
Former student association. I think it was 79. 
Just prior to when they raised the award in the

17:32.435 --> 17:36.060
amount. What is it now? I think it's 4,000 now. I got 
1,000. Is it that much? Mm-hmm. They did it all in

17:42.248 --> 17:44.531
one year, which is fascinating. Hmm.

17:48.215 --> 17:48.916
Let's see. Some innovations... I think when we 
innovate, when we start inquiry day, at least at

17:52.437 --> 17:57.184
the beginning, it generates a lot of excitement. 
And I like those kinds of things. This inquiry

18:00.729 --> 18:04.234
thing was a big thrust of the inquiry things, 
right? Yes. And did everybody buy into that pretty

18:05.956 --> 18:08.680
much, or was it? I don't think everybody 
understood it at first. But

18:12.606 --> 18:17.312
I think everybody did it first. But for some 
reason, it's kind of waned. The first couple years

18:20.939 --> 18:22.962
we had these were huge crowds. And even classes 
turned their students out to come. For the inquiry

18:26.027 --> 18:26.989
day. Now that doesn't happen anymore. That's not 
the same, though. That's separate from your

18:30.094 --> 18:37.486
inquiry within the college where they have the 
different faculty collaborating on some inquiry

18:30.094 --> 18:37.486
groups. Well, it kind of culminated in inquiry 
day. But I don't think the inquiry committees, for

18:40.270 --> 18:46.440
example, the inquiry committee on international 
education We haven't had a meeting in over a year,

18:47.770 --> 18:53.539
and there's not much happening there, and I don't 
hear too much about some of the other groups

18:47.770 --> 18:53.539
meeting much anymore. Used to be one on the older 
adults. I don't hear much about it. I think the

18:56.503 --> 18:59.587
interest has waned or something's happened. In 
fact, they're too busy. I don't know what. Did your

19:01.791 --> 19:02.812
faculty buy it? Was your faculty supportive of 
that? Did they participate when it first came?

19:06.758 --> 19:06.858
Yeah. We had faculty. I think every one of our 
faculty were on one committee or another one. One

19:11.926 --> 19:13.508
of the things that I've heard is that it gave 
faculty, because the college had grown so much and

19:14.028 --> 19:27.508
people didn't know each other in different 
departments, that it was strictly for a collegial

19:14.028 --> 19:27.508
type, you know, activity to get people to work 
outside of department lines and just work on

19:14.028 --> 19:27.508
interest. I think it helped. Was that the goal of, 
was that the reason that Dean Corrigan had...

19:32.856 --> 19:33.618
Probably part of it. I think another reason was to 
get the faculty more active into inquiry. And I

19:37.864 --> 19:39.867
think that had some success, yes. This has been his 
emphasis since he came to Texas A&M. And I think

19:42.986 --> 19:44.887
he's right on target with that. OK, how does that 
differ from Dean Hubert's leadership? Can you

19:48.351 --> 19:53.876
elaborate a little bit on the contrast between the 
two and what kinds of emphasis were? I never saw

19:54.437 --> 20:00.703
Dean Hubert making much effort to get the faculty 
to work interdisciplinary or

19:54.437 --> 20:00.703
cross-disciplinary. I don't think the dean 
really encouraged faculty to pursue specific

20:07.792 --> 20:09.895
interests or other kinds of things. You kind of let 
them go their own way. And bigger departments and

20:11.396 --> 20:14.921
department heads knew what was best within the 
departments. So I think that was one difference.

20:20.748 --> 20:30.460
Can you elaborate a little bit more on your, or 
reminisce a little on working under Dean Huber and

20:20.748 --> 20:30.460
what that entailed versus under Dean Corrigan? 
What kinds of things were different? I was only

20:32.262 --> 20:34.605
administrator under Dean Huber a little over a 
year. Okay. I didn't get too much from him. I

20:38.843 --> 20:47.754
learned much from him on how to prepare and how to 
document, do your homework before you ask for

20:38.843 --> 20:47.754
things, which I think is very important. I don't 
think he shared as much with us of the university

20:49.196 --> 20:59.990
problems and university politics and university 
structure that Dean Corrigan does. I've learned

21:00.050 --> 21:04.596
much of that from Dean Corrigan. Dean Corrigan has 
his department head to meet with him individually

21:05.740 --> 21:09.704
once or twice a month. Dean Hubert never did that, 
never encouraged that at all. And that's very

21:13.888 --> 21:17.592
helpful, to get to talk to your dean one-on-one 
regularly. That's a very good thing to do. Dean

21:21.095 --> 21:23.177
Corrigan has an open door policy. He tells 
students that, and they take him up on it. I think it

21:27.361 --> 21:31.045
kind of surprises them when they find out they can 
walk into his office with an appointment. They can

21:31.745 --> 21:33.267
go in and talk about anything they want to. And he 
listens to them and interacts with them. Dean

21:36.470 --> 21:38.011
Hubert did not do that. I don't think he encouraged 
that too much. Did Dean Hubert teach at all? I don't

21:42.835 --> 21:43.436
know. I think he taught a class, but I'm not sure. I 
don't really remember. When he went on to be

21:48.560 --> 21:57.187
chancellor, was there continuity

21:48.560 --> 21:57.187
in the office of the dean? Well, Phil Imbacher was 
the interim dean, and he had been in the dean's

21:58.348 --> 22:06.375
office as assistant or associate So him 
maintaining that office, certainly there was

22:07.267 --> 22:10.851
continuity. And that was his purpose. And his goal 
was simply maintain it. There were no new programs

22:14.534 --> 22:18.478
or anything like that going on or starting. But he 
kept it going, yes. OK. And any insights or

22:21.802 --> 22:36.717
observations that you have made over the years or 
anecdotes, something that stands out as above

22:21.802 --> 22:36.717
particular incident, particular student, or 
particular Well, you mentioned one. You already

22:38.651 --> 22:42.275
did mention a student going on to high levels. I 
think the biggest thing that I've had to learn is

22:43.136 --> 22:46.700
the Aggie way of doing things. Which is? I'll give 
you a couple examples. When I came to Texas A&M to

22:52.727 --> 23:06.062
interview, I decided not to come to A&M

22:52.727 --> 23:06.062
because the individual I was going to be working 
under who had been hired before me was not an adult

23:07.021 --> 23:09.584
educator, and he couldn't make graduate faculty. 
And I knew I could. So I knew he was going to be doing

23:10.445 --> 23:11.866
all the work. And I went back and told my wife, 
scratch A&M. But two or three weeks later, I was

23:16.731 --> 23:19.174
called and told the other guy had resigned. He'd 
found something else to do. And then I was asked to

23:20.435 --> 23:24.179
consider the first position. We negotiated over 
the phone. So when I came to buy a house, the dean

23:28.063 --> 23:36.572
told me, OK, we're getting some applications in. 
And we're going to look at them for the second

23:37.345 --> 23:39.588
person. And when we decide who it is we think, we'll 
send it to you and let you take a look at it. So about a

23:45.077 --> 23:51.706
month later, in August, before I came, I got Bob 
Pelins' beta and a little note that said, here's

23:45.077 --> 23:51.706
the guy we hired. We hope you like him. Which showed 
me right away how Aggies do things. And the other

23:57.755 --> 24:00.379
way, I think, is when Dean Hubert became 
chancellor. Because he told me personally that

24:01.361 --> 24:06.829
when he was called in, he was called the night 
before the meeting They wanted to talk to him the

24:07.450 --> 24:14.340
next morning, and he thought they were calling him 
in to get his input as to what the new chancellor

24:07.450 --> 24:14.340
ought to be. When he walked in the next morning, 
they asked him to be chancellor, and he had no idea

24:15.401 --> 24:19.327
they were going to do that. And he had not applied 
for the position. So Aggies have interesting ways

24:23.152 --> 24:25.435
of doing things. Now tell me about, in your 
department, because I've heard that about

24:26.737 --> 24:35.770
somebody that was hired by the dean when actually 
it's up to your department? For example, when you

24:36.921 --> 24:41.225
have a vacancy in your department, what is the 
process that you go through? And then does the dean

24:41.285 --> 24:49.233
have the authority to tell somebody you're hired 
to be in Don Seaman's department without first

24:41.285 --> 24:49.233
going through you? He has the authority, I guess. 
But I've never heard of that happening, at least in

24:51.856 --> 24:55.800
our department. And the procedure is we advertise 
a position in the Chronicle and send them to the

24:56.560 --> 25:05.149
commission professors on a network across the 
country. We view the applications, all the

25:06.226 --> 25:11.552
faculty do, and we get it down to about two or three.

25:14.536 --> 25:21.684
And then we call at least two people in to 
interview, make a certain interview with the dean

25:14.536 --> 25:21.684
also, with the beta. And then at the end of those 
interviews, we take our vote, and then I go up and

25:22.726 --> 25:30.655
sit down with the dean and say, here's who we think 
we want, and here's why. And to date, he's always

25:30.695 --> 25:34.039
concurred. Do you ever have any student input into 
the decisions, or do you let them even look at it?

25:38.178 --> 25:41.203
Every applicant has to present a seminar to our 
students. And I can tell you an instance, several

25:41.223 --> 25:56.205
years ago, in a voc-ed position when I was 
coordinator, faculty kind of agreed to hire this

25:41.223 --> 25:56.205
individual from an institution in Virginia, and 
he gave a seminar to the students, and the students

25:41.223 --> 25:56.205
came in and said, we don't want him. So we didn't 
hire him, because the students said they didn't

25:57.708 --> 26:01.213
want him. I figured they're the ones going to have 
to We did not hire them. Do you know what they based

26:04.855 --> 26:06.798
that on? They didn't think he was going to be very 
conducive to student-faculty relationships.

26:11.805 --> 26:13.728
They asked him some questions. He either didn't 
respond or ignored them or gave them the

26:13.828 --> 26:19.736
impression he didn't have to respond to students. 
And there were no faculty in there. We purposely

26:24.122 --> 26:27.567
did not sit in there. So we said, hey, if you don't 
like him, we're not going to hire him. And we

26:29.910 --> 26:30.351
didn't. How much emphasis do you put on 
student-faculty relations? Do you make that a

26:33.419 --> 26:34.980
part of your faculty? It's a very big part of it. Our 
students are all adults. They're usually

26:38.824 --> 26:39.965
professionals. Sometimes I think we give 
students maybe more attention than we should,

26:42.167 --> 26:47.311
because sometimes they take a lot of time. But 
they're the heart of the university. Without

26:50.594 --> 26:52.736
students, we wouldn't need faculty or 
administrators. And it's the students for whom

26:53.537 --> 27:00.743
the institution is going to be known, not the 
faculty. ultimately it's the students and who

27:00.993 --> 27:04.138
they are and what they are. And if you don't have 
good students and treat them fairly and if they

27:05.900 --> 27:14.433
don't have good vibes about your institution, you 
can have the best faculty in the world, it doesn't

27:05.900 --> 27:14.433
mean anything. Does your department rely very 
much on soft money? At present, no. We did at one

27:22.244 --> 27:25.449
time, at one time we were very heavy into soft 
money. We had, gosh, one year we had about 676 to

27:25.489 --> 27:29.835
$700,000.

27:31.486 --> 27:34.029
But not too much now. Now, this year, we have about 
140,000 to 150,000. But not much.

27:40.237 --> 27:43.461
Do you encourage your faculty to submit 
proposals? I do not encourage the adult faculty

27:43.561 --> 27:46.425
right now because of the student load. When you're 
chairing about 10 doctoral committees and

27:47.046 --> 27:52.853
teaching a course or two and that kind of thing, you 
haven't got time for projects. And in educational

27:53.934 --> 27:58.320
technology, though, they're writing some grants 
and getting some money, and yes. Your department

27:59.144 --> 28:10.458
has gone through some monumental change, not 
monumental, but you just inherited a brand new,

27:59.144 --> 28:10.458
not a department, what is it, a part of your 
department or a program? Yeah, an academic

28:10.538 --> 28:11.159
program. And also, last year you lost two of your 
faculty at one time to a place in Wisconsin.

28:18.087 --> 28:18.928
Montana. Montana. Can you share a little bit about 
what that created for you and the department or how

28:21.271 --> 28:28.560
you were able to keep the continuity and how you've 
been able to, to manage these things as department

28:28.878 --> 28:30.640
head? With great difficulty.

28:35.026 --> 28:37.629
The rest of the faculty picked up the load or tried 
to. We cut back a little bit in teaching so that we

28:37.669 --> 28:42.455
could keep our student advising load going. But 
the main thing is that we did not let any students

28:44.497 --> 28:51.586
slow down or did not have any student have any 
setback in their progress. We kept them going. We

28:54.933 --> 28:59.461
employed a couple of new faculty as soon as we could 
at the assistant professor level. One of them has

29:00.222 --> 29:07.375
already made graduate faculty and is permitted 
now to start advising students and the other one is

29:00.222 --> 29:07.375
working on it. So we hired some pretty good people 
and kept it going. By graduate faculty, what does

29:11.181 --> 29:12.624
that mean? That means you are permitted to advise 
graduate students, chair committees. And that

29:19.570 --> 29:26.217
means you've served on some committees that have 
finished, and you've published, and you've done a

29:19.570 --> 29:26.217
few things that are required to do that. And why is 
one of your people, or is it the general over the

29:26.378 --> 29:33.245
college, about going up for tenure or for 
promotion or whatnot? Is that the criteria set by

29:33.285 --> 29:36.329
the college? In most cases, it's seven years. So 
you go in at the beginning of your sixth year. Then

29:42.556 --> 29:45.679
if you don't make it, you've got one more year to 
work to find another position.
