Testing, one, two, three. Testing, yes. It's 
working. No problem. Just say that I think you were

00:06.441 --> 00:14.314
closing by saying that I don't see any reference to 
the Louisiana-Missouri plant in current

00:06.441 --> 00:14.314
gasification papers. And I

00:15.837 --> 00:25.332
don't think that the present investigators are 
not aware of the Louisiana plant. But it may be that

00:25.352 --> 00:28.097
there's just been nothing published on it that I 
know. I don't know. As far as I know, there's been no

00:30.828 --> 00:33.011
I haven't seen any data from the Louisiana plant. 
And what McGee and Cattell would know this better

00:35.534 --> 00:42.223
than I, I don't think there's been a paper on the 
gasification part of the plant. I know there's

00:42.303 --> 00:44.205
only one on that purification. I don't know 
whether anything has been published on the

00:44.686 --> 00:46.749
Burgess. I mean, in the public literature, not 
government interim reports or that sort of thing.

00:54.238 --> 00:54.679
I don't know. Do you think they were on the right 
track? Oh, I do. I do.

01:04.638 --> 01:06.823
There's renewed interest now in Fisher Tropes. 
ERDA has several contracts out, looking at Fisher

01:07.184 --> 01:16.946
Tropes, and one is with Exxon.

01:17.107 --> 01:18.570
I think that

01:20.913 --> 01:23.876
But it was a rough approach. Let me just step back 
one step. Did you have any dealing with the German

01:25.578 --> 01:30.803
scientists who were brought to Louisiana, 
Missouri? The only thing I can recall, really, is

01:30.823 --> 01:42.915
having met them when they were here in Morgantown, 
and having our pictures taken. I don't know

01:42.975 --> 01:45.638
whether they'd be around for a while. And I can only 
recall three of them. I don't know how many there

01:48.410 --> 01:49.531
were. We got five or six, I would imagine. You 
mentioned a Dr. Opelt. Hoobman. And Hoobman. And

01:54.736 --> 01:56.277
Donoff. And Donoff. Did you get any other names?

02:00.721 --> 02:01.042
Let's see. We have...

02:01.062 --> 02:06.467
Oh, I haven't got them here. We have a list of the 
seven signs. Oh, but there's seven? Yes. Because

02:09.550 --> 02:12.413
we have a list of the Bureau of Managed Reports for 
the seven signs. Yes.

02:14.103 --> 02:18.870
O-P-B-E-L-T-H-U-B-M-A-N-N-D-O-N-A-T-H.

02:21.413 --> 02:29.745
But of course, if the purification wasn't based 
upon the German process, you wouldn't have had too

02:21.413 --> 02:29.745
much interaction with the Germans. No. But I think 
that those men probably were more of gasification

02:29.845 --> 02:40.279
and hydrogenation and not as much involved in 
purification. I don't know whether Dr. Ruppelt's

02:41.035 --> 02:48.806
around now, but I think he'd have been with Babcock 
and Wilcox at one time. And you developed a process

02:48.826 --> 02:53.572
that would purify 5,000 cubic feet? Yeah, a small 
pilot plant.

02:58.740 --> 03:04.748
That was before we had the station out here in 
Coventry River. It was really a Gerger

03:05.538 --> 03:08.121
purification design. In fact, Gerger 
constructed it for us. Did you use any German

03:12.707 --> 03:19.135
vessels or pumps or anything like that? No, it was 
all manufactured here. In fact, at that time, you

03:23.600 --> 03:34.313
had to have a very good justification if you 
purchased any foreign equipment for use in

03:23.600 --> 03:34.313
government work. Even as far as the

03:34.715 --> 03:52.492
instrumentation like the analytical 
instrumentation such as x-ray diffraction or

03:34.715 --> 03:52.492
infrared or ultraviolet, you had to have a very 
strong justification if you wanted to buy it from

03:34.715 --> 03:52.492
overseas. I think that's used at some point now. So 
in your opinion, it really wouldn't stand to

03:55.315 --> 04:03.523
reason for someone to undertake these same 
efforts again to experiments to start

04:04.533 --> 04:29.595
experimenting with gas purification when in fact 
it has been successfully accomplished

04:04.533 --> 04:29.595
the only area that i think there can be improvement 
would be in the liquid absorbent for removing

04:04.533 --> 04:29.595
hydrogen sulfide if you can get a greater sort of 
that has a greater capacity Although I think the

04:30.149 --> 04:47.405
bent-fill process is probably going to be very 
hard to beat since its absorption and

04:30.149 --> 04:47.405
regeneration

04:30.149 --> 04:47.405
take place at pretty much the same temperature, so 
you don't have much cooling of the liquid when you

04:30.149 --> 04:47.405
regenerate it. You don't use as much steam to 
regenerate it.

04:55.242 --> 04:57.307
Well, I'm not too familiar with the Stretford 
process. McGee would be on that. That would be an

04:59.852 --> 05:08.090
improvement, I'm sure, over the old cost process 
for producing sulfur from hydrogen sulfide. That

05:08.111 --> 05:13.302
would be an operation at the StenPay plant in 
Brewston, so we can actually get data from that.
