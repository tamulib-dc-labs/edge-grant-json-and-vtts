00:03.389 --> 00:14.981
I've always felt that the military was one way you 
could pay some rent on the space you occupied in

00:03.389 --> 00:14.981
this country. In other words, patriotism. Call it 
what you want. And I don't know how much of it's

00:20.046 --> 00:25.551
hereditary, how much of it's A&M. I've always been 
a fairly conscientious soldier.

00:40.784 --> 01:01.528
During 1961, when we were

00:40.784 --> 01:01.528
down in Fort Polk, or early 1962, and we were on 
maneuvers, Iron Dragon,

00:40.784 --> 01:01.528
and I was Combat Command, Sea Command. General 
West called me up one night. I know he was under

01:03.230 --> 01:04.692
pressure. He told me, I want you to send One outfit 
that way and one outfit that way. Do you

01:09.182 --> 01:10.063
understand? I said, yes, sir. So at the break, I 
went up to General West, and I said, General, I'd

01:13.108 --> 01:20.858
like to talk to you privately. And he said, what's 
it about? I said, would you step outside the tent

01:22.100 --> 01:27.668
where we could talk privately? I said, General, I 
like my job, and I know there's no profit in this

01:27.688 --> 01:33.015
conversation. But did you realize the two of us 
were trying to run the same outfit? I said, if you

01:39.085 --> 01:45.973
just tell me what you want done, I'll work my butt 
off to get it done. And if I don't, you can have my

01:46.013 --> 01:47.915
head. But will you let me run my

01:48.816 --> 01:58.627
own outfit? But I used to tell my battalions down 
there, If my staff comes in there and tries to run

02:02.813 --> 02:11.083
your outfit and you don't kick them out, then I'm 
going to look at you. Because I'm paying you, or the

02:11.103 --> 02:16.749
government is, to run your outfit. And if I find you 
can't, I'll get somebody else. That's the way I

02:20.974 --> 02:23.357
feel. I also feel that there's no one guy that's so 
important we can't get along with that.

02:35.703 --> 02:37.426
That's about my story. What did you decide to go in 
the Texas National Guard instead of the Army

02:37.446 --> 02:42.794
Reserves? Well, I was already in the Army Reserves 
when I got out. I signed up for it. See, the Texas

02:51.347 --> 02:55.393
National Guard or any National Guard, you have a 
dual commission. Reserve Washington, federally

02:56.434 --> 03:02.363
recognized guard, too. I got in that by the back 
door. Travis Bryan, Sr., who I've been friends

03:06.483 --> 03:11.088
with for a long, long time.

03:14.572 --> 03:19.857
He had many, many friends in the military. He 
called me one day and he said, come on down to the

03:19.877 --> 03:22.420
bank. I want to talk to you. Was this in 1947? 1946.

03:29.147 --> 03:33.992
He had a Colonel Fitzhugh, who was senior advisor

03:35.963 --> 03:40.710
And I said, we were forming probably late 46. I 
said, we're forming the 49th Army Division. The

03:45.878 --> 03:48.862
division headquartered the engineer battalion. 
Brian would like you to take it over. I said, all

03:51.786 --> 03:55.291
right. So they hadn't formed the headquarters, so 
they couldn't have a battalion commander. They

04:03.684 --> 04:05.346
had formed the headquarters company. So I took 
federal recognition as a captain and a motor

04:05.984 --> 04:10.330
officer. Is that why you went, you skipped down to a 
captain, you were a major, you went down to a

04:10.430 --> 04:19.663
captain, then you went back up to a lieutenant 
colonel, and you skipped the major? Will you

04:20.624 --> 04:24.610
explain how you kept skipping around in the ranks 
for a couple of months? Well, the reason why was

04:24.630 --> 04:29.056
they hadn't formed the headquarters. You see, 
each unit has what we call a table of

04:29.076 --> 04:35.164
organizational equipment, you see. for one 
lieutenant colonel, one major, two majors, so on.

04:41.083 --> 04:46.388
And they didn't have a headquarters, so they 
didn't have a spot for a lieutenant colonel. They

04:46.488 --> 04:49.331
had a headquarters company, you see. So I took a job 
as captain motor officer, just to go on and get

04:49.351 --> 04:54.436
here. And got federally recognized captaincy. 
And the minute they formed the headquarters, then

04:57.480 --> 05:03.666
I got federally recognized lieutenant colonel.

05:05.857 --> 05:10.783
And I commanded the unit for 11 years.

05:10.803 --> 05:19.393
And I finally went to CG, and I said, General, I've 
been commanding this unit for 11 years. All I'm

05:19.413 --> 05:22.497
doing now is going over the same old things again 
and again. And I said, I'm holding up everybody

05:22.657 --> 05:25.901
else in my outfit. He said, have you got a job on the 
staff? He said, maybe. So I became a trains

05:32.489 --> 05:34.311
commander. Now,

05:34.662 --> 05:43.111
what did you do with the 386th armored engineering 
battalion? What did I do with it? Tell me about the

05:47.756 --> 05:48.837
signs. What was your task? Well, we had the 
headquarters company, bridge company, three

05:51.080 --> 06:01.210
lines. So you had a total personnel of what?

06:08.142 --> 06:15.634
Between 800 and 1,000. And what I did with it, I feel 
like I made one of the best battalions in the 49th

06:15.654 --> 06:28.956
Army. So you did a lot of training? Yes, sir. We did a 
lot of training. We did a lot of planning. C.B.

06:37.645 --> 06:46.137
Hewitt, Cap Hewitt was

06:37.645 --> 06:46.137
my exec. And we'd have planning sessions, what if 
we got people out of the railroad center, you know,

06:46.157 --> 06:56.773
which I'd been through. How would we handle that 
situation? What if this, what if that? And try to do

07:02.461 --> 07:04.204
those things. And, of course, we had to go through 
whatever training cycles were prescribed by the

07:05.298 --> 07:13.471
military. But

07:13.491 --> 07:19.880
we just tried to be the people that did our job. Did 
Korea have any impact on your job? No, it didn't,

07:25.489 --> 07:34.022
except it had an impact on my business.

07:36.112 --> 07:51.060
The number one latrine room was flying fast and 
thick, and I could not see going back active duty

07:36.112 --> 07:51.060
for the business. And it prompted me to sell out to 
my partner, who later went broke. In other words,

07:57.661 --> 08:02.968
you thought then that you would be called up during 
the Korean War? Yes, sir. In fact, the rumors were

08:03.769 --> 08:05.491
real strife. And later on, I talked to Johnny 
Johnson, and he said, I just finally went to

08:05.651 --> 08:15.825
Washington.

08:15.845 --> 08:19.169
And he said, I was flat-ass. And they said, 
General, we were fixing to call one more division,

08:19.189 --> 08:26.959
specifically the 49th Armored Division. when we 
decided not to call it a morning. So that's how

08:34.680 --> 08:35.481
close to 50 we came to it. How are your feelings? Did 
you want

08:36.282 --> 08:42.849
to go to a funeral? Not particularly, but like I 
said, they tell me where to go, I go. It's about that

08:52.381 --> 08:53.402
simple. Did your training techniques change in 
any way because of the war? Did you train more

08:59.283 --> 09:02.247
intensively?

09:03.468 --> 09:04.329
Did you meet more often? No. For a long time, we met 
on Monday nights.

09:11.979 --> 09:19.368
One thing we were certainly aware of was what our 
strengths and what our limitations

09:11.979 --> 09:19.368
were. We must necessarily have some limitations. 
Then they went to what they called

09:27.993 --> 09:42.071
which instead of meeting Monday night, four 
nights a month or five nights, we had a drill on

09:27.993 --> 09:42.071
Saturday and Sunday, and you got credit for four 
drills. You got paid on basically four drills

09:42.091 --> 09:47.818
where you could get more done. So you could get more 
done on the weekend. Right. How about morale? Did

09:51.843 --> 09:54.246
it have any impact on morale? I don't think so. It 
had either way. You see, we had two types of people.

10:00.240 --> 10:11.294
One

10:00.240 --> 10:11.294
of them was

10:00.240 --> 10:11.294
former people during the war. The others were 
those who perhaps took that in lieu of being

10:11.314 --> 10:21.347
drafted.

10:21.367 --> 10:23.970
Was there any conflict between these two 
different types?

10:27.646 --> 10:29.007
It was in every organization. We had Goodwin's and 
we had Sargent's. But I had my niece's husband

10:33.011 --> 10:50.406
who lived in his private and rose off fast and got to 
start approaching Sargent. In fact, he was

10:50.426 --> 10:53.969
recommended for it. So we sat back and looked, and 
we devised a test and decreed that in our battalion

10:57.262 --> 11:10.620
that nobody got to be promoted above a corporal 
without passing the test. And we instituted

11:10.640 --> 11:13.024
various stations. We'd set them up. Said, we're 
not telling you, company commander, who you can

11:14.025 --> 11:19.733
promote or not promote. All we can tell you is if he 
doesn't pass it, we won't accept him. And we'd set

11:24.660 --> 11:27.083
up first aid stations We wanted to know first aid 
and sanitation. We wanted to know

11:41.069 --> 11:57.846
how to field strip an M1 rifle, machine gun, things 
that basically, if you were a specialist, such as a

11:41.069 --> 11:57.846
demolition specialist, we want to know what the 
safety procedures were, how to wire parallel and

11:58.957 --> 12:07.791
series, and what the effects were, all of those 
things. So your mission was training? Sir? Your

12:09.995 --> 12:11.637
mission was training? Yes, sir. And preparation? 
Yes, sir. And we knew what our limitations were

12:14.321 --> 12:21.172
and what our strengths were. That's exactly what 
it was. Okay, after 11 years of this stuff, You

12:26.598 --> 12:29.403
moved down to the 49th Army Division? Division 
trains.

12:35.193 --> 12:39.520
You stayed there for three years, and what was your 
mission now? Again, training. I don't know if

12:41.243 --> 12:51.981
you're familiar with trains, but that's your 
support units, your ordnance battalion, your

12:41.243 --> 12:51.981
quartermaster battalion, all of those, and the 
band.

12:57.007 --> 12:59.609
I set standards. It was like I went to 
Quartermaster Battalion at one time. And they

13:05.074 --> 13:08.497
were good out there. You were activated in 1961 
during the Berlin crisis, and you were activated

13:08.517 --> 13:19.567
for, let's say, about ten months, from 61 to August 
of 62. Why were you activated? The whole division

13:22.609 --> 13:24.591
was activated. The entire division was 
activated? The president has that right. And so,

13:28.365 --> 13:29.887
where'd you go?

13:33.232 --> 13:33.693
We went to Louisiana. See, in June, I had to come 
back and

13:33.713 --> 13:43.989
come in secretly. We went to Louisiana. Was there a 
lot of war going on? No, not particularly. It was a

13:49.197 --> 13:51.401
Berlin crisis. It could have developed into 
something. But our mission was to get ready and be

13:55.124 --> 14:00.671
effective. And we made it. General West, our 
division commander at the time, was one of the few

14:04.336 --> 14:15.049
people who could carry us through and face the 
difficulties. Everything there, even support

14:15.069 --> 14:22.178
groups were reserved, Baton Rouge and so forth and 
there. And we were put under considerable

14:22.900 --> 14:32.190
intolerable situations with really lack of 
funding. He had to do a lot of deficit funding. And I

14:35.974 --> 14:51.591
really think the feel that the Army expected us to 
make,

14:35.974 --> 14:51.591
maybe a full-time professional soldier feels a 
part-time professional soldier can't do it. In

14:52.364 --> 15:04.318
other words, was there a conflict, an antagonism 
between the regulars and the

14:52.364 --> 15:04.318
reserves? Oh,

15:04.338 --> 15:08.723
yes and no. It's difficult to answer. The regular 
army knows it can't fight a war by itself, but by the

15:11.907 --> 15:21.898
same token, I guess we'd be known as weekend 
warriors, which a full-time professional man

15:23.498 --> 15:40.937
doesn't connote the highest respect as a group, as 
an individual might

15:23.498 --> 15:40.937
be. But they were ill-prepared and things. See, 
the problem with the military, like a lot of other

15:46.663 --> 15:53.370
things, they have these problems. They create 
solutions. Those people are retiring some new

15:56.435 --> 16:00.379
people. See, they had all this replacements. And I 
got a list of them all over the Southwest,

16:06.566 --> 16:13.933
Louisiana, New Mexico. Half those people moved to 
another place, something. People had been off

16:18.958 --> 16:22.041
duty six months. Gotten married, started in the 
business, suddenly got recalled to duty without

16:23.152 --> 16:27.618
any warning. They finally had to come out with a 
pamphlet on it. Things like that.

16:33.907 --> 16:39.395
Doesn't breathe the greatest of things. But...

16:39.415 --> 16:50.912
Did you like being back on the

16:39.415 --> 16:50.912
active duty? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've never had any 
aversion

16:53.189 --> 16:58.955
to the military. The hardest job I ever had in my 
life was being a company commander. Why was that?

17:06.882 --> 17:08.644
That's a 26-hour day job.

17:13.469 --> 17:17.092
And how big was your company? 200

17:17.112 --> 17:21.276
people. I don't know. It was just the hardest job. I 
worked hard at being a battalion commander, and I

17:23.800 --> 17:34.032
worked hard at being a combat commander, division 
training commander. But it seemed to be more, I was

17:34.052 --> 17:45.907
directly responsible for every troop around 
there, 24 hours a day. Of course,

17:45.927 --> 17:50.652
it was wartime. But... I had no aversion to going 
back to active duty. It was something of an

17:55.379 --> 17:58.642
upheaval. But again, you pay your money and you 
take the chances. Do you think the fact that you

18:07.591 --> 18:16.399
were on active duty, do you think that that had some 
impact on your being promoted to brigadier

18:07.591 --> 18:16.399
general shortly thereafter? I don't think 
there's any question

18:16.419 --> 18:21.444
of that. I think I had the the sharpest operation 
down there. Some of the other combat commanders

18:26.256 --> 18:31.162
might question that. But I do know that we set up our 
own standing operating procedure for day and

18:31.182 --> 18:43.655
night, worked it out ourselves. I do know that the 
division standing operating procedure was

18:43.675 --> 18:48.140
copied from it. In fact, they accidentally left 
some words in it pertaining to us. We just set up and

18:53.457 --> 18:55.661
organized. I knew what I wanted. See, they rotated 
battalions. And when a battalion came into our

19:01.411 --> 19:09.666
thing, we handed them a sheet of paper and said, 
this will bring you up to date. Now, we hold

19:09.686 --> 19:16.157
Reveille and retreat formation are not spelled 
out exactly in the regulations. We said, this is

19:17.757 --> 19:24.163
the way we do Reveille, and this is the way we do 
retreat, and everybody does it the same way. Any

19:24.183 --> 19:24.924
questions?

19:27.907 --> 19:35.454
And they could read all of that and bring them up to 
where

19:27.907 --> 19:35.454
we operate. How did you first learn that you were 
going to be promoted to

19:35.474 --> 19:44.203
general? Oh. That was an interesting and long 
story. I was probably the senior qualified

19:49.091 --> 19:57.858
colonel at the time. An interesting story,

19:57.879 --> 20:02.603
if you want to hear it. It took six months. It took 
six months until you got the word? No. What do you

20:10.810 --> 20:12.391
mean it took six months? It took six months for me to 
get federally recognized. Well, when we got back

20:16.600 --> 20:32.466
from Polk, Assistant Division Commander Jim 
Scott, who I served with for a long time,

20:16.600 --> 20:32.466
became Assistant Adjutant General Army, which 
opened up the spot. So my papers were duly sent in to

20:34.229 --> 20:39.798
the National Guard Bureau. And they came back and 
said, we're sorry.

20:45.068 --> 21:00.326
But the regulations prescribe

20:45.068 --> 21:00.326
that when there's only one Assistant Adjutant 
General and the Adjutant General is Army, the

20:45.068 --> 21:00.326
Assistant Adjutant General has to be Air. 
Therefore, the spot wasn't vacant. Although he

21:04.571 --> 21:08.235
was still Adjutant General, he was still 
technically carried. He carried his Assistant

21:08.475 --> 21:10.738
Division Commander.

21:14.313 --> 21:22.346
So they got a bill through at the last of the 
legislative session, which provided for an

21:14.313 --> 21:22.346
assisted action for General Ayers. And it was a 
catch-all bill, and it was on a voice vote. So they

21:28.375 --> 21:41.957
again submitted my papers, and the National Guard 
Bureau came back and said, we're sorry, but under

21:28.375 --> 21:41.957
Texas law,

21:28.375 --> 21:41.957
when it's not a vote of record, the law doesn't come 
effective until 90 days after the cessation of the

21:43.675 --> 21:49.563
legislature. So I had to wait another 90

21:49.583 --> 21:54.669
days. In other words, is there a lot of politics in 
the

21:54.689 --> 22:03.561
House? No. The old 36th Division, I think, over the 
years, developed politics in the inns and the

22:03.661 --> 22:10.510
houses. I think the 49th was rather singularly 
free of politics. I never did feel like I wasn't

22:17.118 --> 22:32.342
politically well-connected, that my promotions 
had anything to do with just being the right guy at

22:17.118 --> 22:32.342
the right time. Because

22:32.362 --> 22:38.792
we were singularly free of politics.

22:42.772 --> 22:50.561
I hear that National

22:42.772 --> 22:50.561
Guard is more political than the Army Reserve. 
Would you comment on that? Perhaps.

22:59.372 --> 23:11.226
Because the Army Guard, although federally 
recognized, the Adjutant General is

22:59.372 --> 23:11.226
state-employed.

23:11.594 --> 23:20.006
Within the state of Texas now, in some states, a new 
governor comes in, he appoints a new Adjutant

23:11.594 --> 23:20.006
General. And in the past year,

23:20.026 --> 23:39.795
many years past, when the governor wanted to get 
rid of an Adjutant General, and the paper would

23:20.026 --> 23:39.795
come out about using a government vehicle for 
personal business or something, we'd finally put

23:20.026 --> 23:39.795
enough pressure on him to resign. But we have more 
or less had an unwritten deal with governors for

23:40.467 --> 23:54.201
several years that they don't do that. And when 
Governor Clements came into office, the same

23:54.221 --> 24:01.069
acting general was under Dolph Briscoe. And when 
Dolph Briscoe came in, whoever was acting general

24:01.089 --> 24:06.755
was still the same. So we've had some excellent 
continuity. So I'd say that we're less political

24:10.049 --> 24:20.178
than perhaps in other places. I can't speak for 
other states. I'm sure in some instances there's

24:21.800 --> 24:29.047
politics involved, particularly the old units, 
perhaps the later units. In the 49th, it was almost

24:29.067 --> 24:33.991
done. And with me, my criterion was Can they do it, 
or can't they do it? If they can do it, they stay. If

24:43.098 --> 24:47.564
they can't do it, they go. I figured I was paid to do a 
job, and if I didn't do it, they ought to get

24:47.584 --> 24:55.695
somebody else. That simple. You were made general 
in 1963, and you had the assistant division CEO.

25:03.245 --> 25:05.588
What did you do as far as that was concerned? I had 
more fun as a colonel than a lieutenant colonel

25:07.778 --> 25:18.810
ever had as assistant division commander. Why? 
The duties of an assistant division commander,

25:19.531 --> 25:32.885
according to regulations, are such duties as may 
be delegated

25:19.531 --> 25:32.885
by the division commander. In other words, this 
right up here, in case they ever have a child, And

25:38.356 --> 25:43.161
that's what an assistant military commander is. I 
spent most of my time going out to the field,

25:43.662 --> 26:01.622
visiting units, checking training, and as much to 
be seen as to see. Let them see

26:01.642 --> 26:08.329
somebody in the division headquarters and carry 
them. General West has to make command

26:09.068 --> 26:19.118
inspections of the various commands, but he can't 
make them all. During this time, Vietnam was

26:19.138 --> 26:24.464
starting to grow. Did you, were you in any way 
interested in going over and volunteering for

26:24.484 --> 26:31.571
that? No, not particularly. I was a member of an 
organization.

26:36.596 --> 26:38.518
See, we got through at Polk.

26:40.777 --> 26:49.026
Well, before we got through, I left

26:40.777 --> 26:49.026
a little early. I went up to Pentagon for about a 
little over 30 days. They had a project in their hip

26:54.973 --> 27:02.442
pocket

26:54.973 --> 27:02.442
for about 17 months. They needed to develop a 
command structure. For example, Louisiana and

27:07.540 --> 27:14.972
Arkansas split a division for a long time. They 
needed to have a command headquarters that could

27:14.992 --> 27:22.485
take over the troops in those various states. And 
so I was detailed, three or four of us were detailed

27:22.505 --> 27:30.277
to work on. And we developed a command structure. 
And I had to present to Chief of National Guard, and

27:35.502 --> 27:53.878
he argued with me on several points, because I had a 
small quartermaster section, a small hardening

27:35.502 --> 27:53.878
section, and so on and so forth, maybe two officers 
and three men. And what the criteria was, not more

27:53.898 --> 27:57.721
than 200. Leave a little fat for the Army to cut out, 
because they all want to cut out some. And the chief

28:06.856 --> 28:12.184
said, we don't need those quartermaster people 
and so forth. We can depend on troops at the post.

28:15.709 --> 28:19.515
And I said, General, we can't depend on troops at 
the post. I've been through that. They don't

28:20.877 --> 28:23.360
necessarily know what's going on. I think we need 
our own advisors. He bought it. And what I was

28:27.366 --> 28:35.378
pleased with, it came out reasonably close to what 
we went after. What did you think about the work at

28:36.691 --> 28:41.195
the Pentagon? Oh, it was interesting.

28:47.141 --> 28:52.727
The Army is not an efficient organization. It's 
not designed to be. It's designed to fight wars.

28:59.974 --> 29:03.297
They make mistakes. I used to tell my staff down at 
Fort Polk, If you think I'm going to be right 100% of

29:06.897 --> 29:12.966
the time, you better rearrange your thinking. I 
said, I ought to be right 95% of the time. That 5% is

29:16.131 --> 29:19.897
in minor areas. And I said, we'll do this. I'll 
listen to any suggestion. You can call me an SOB,

29:24.644 --> 29:28.931
and I won't take offense. But the very instant that 
I said, that's fine. Now, this is the way we do it.

29:37.222 --> 29:44.532
you better forget about

29:37.222 --> 29:44.532
everything else. But that was an interesting 
thing. I never meant to paint. What did you think of

29:50.541 --> 29:57.350
the quality of all the sir that you were working 
with that were at the Pentagon? High quality.

29:58.452 --> 29:58.853
High? Yes. Basically, you thought the people that 
run the regular professional army? Well, in the

30:04.240 --> 30:06.283
Bureau, the Chief of National Guard for the U.S. 
National Guard Office. And it happened to be that

30:11.356 --> 30:21.348
the Chief of the Army Branch, General Clayton P. 
Kerr, used to be a division commander, assistant

30:11.356 --> 30:21.348
division commander. So I didn't go in blind.

30:26.274 --> 30:27.495
In the past,

30:30.158 --> 30:48.644
The local states like Rhode Island, Maryland, 
places where they just run over the Pentagon,

30:30.158 --> 30:48.644
maybe got a little more attention paid to them than 
some of the southern or western

30:30.158 --> 30:48.644
states. That's been changed now. The chief of the 
National Guard Bureau now

30:59.842 --> 31:12.580
He

30:59.842 --> 31:12.580
used to be the staff assistant

30:59.842 --> 31:12.580
of the Oklahoma National Guard. I've known him for 
years. And he is the first

31:15.925 --> 31:21.533
incident last year. He is the first incident of the 
Chief National Guard Bureau being promoted to

31:21.553 --> 31:23.496
lieutenant general. And he's a surgeon. He's 
fine. During Vietnam, was When you were a general

31:25.238 --> 31:36.516
in the National Guard, did that seem to have any 
impact on the Guard in Texas? No. I counseled a lot

31:37.398 --> 31:45.531
of people, not necessarily the Guard.

31:45.551 --> 31:52.562
The Vietnam War was a particularly

31:45.551 --> 31:52.562
war, more so than the Korean War was to me.

31:56.525 --> 32:09.524
I remember during World War II, our entire 
national effort was directed toward winning the

31:56.525 --> 32:09.524
war, our entire national effort. People went to 
Vietnam. I think it felt like that once they left,

32:12.448 --> 32:19.838
that everybody went by their own day's business. 
There was no national effort behind it. And

32:27.052 --> 32:39.324
besides what I've been able to determine, it was a 
dirty,

32:27.052 --> 32:39.324
nasty war. And there's always been wars. During 
this time, of course, you had the rise of a number of

32:40.666 --> 32:48.654
women in the service, and the rise of blacks in the 
service, or tremendous increase. Did that have

32:48.674 --> 32:55.140
any impact on the National Guard here in Texas?

32:55.160 --> 32:56.181
No.

33:00.532 --> 33:06.920
We had, really we didn't have any women in the 
National Guard. We didn't have any probation

33:06.940 --> 33:09.643
before. The Reserves had some probation before, 
but we didn't

33:09.663 --> 33:16.312
have any. I don't know of any National Guard 
hospitals and stuff, so we didn't have nurses.

33:24.382 --> 33:27.366
They didn't have any secretaries? They were all 
staff assistants. Blacks, we had some.

33:36.885 --> 33:47.037
We didn't have any large

33:36.885 --> 33:47.037
concentration. They never presented a real 
problem. We had, at Fort Polk, we had a lot of

33:50.521 --> 33:56.649
village blacks. And I had one lieutenant that I 
thought the world

34:02.615 --> 34:09.244
And he was in a predominantly Latin American 
battalion. They could carry less.

34:10.685 --> 34:15.452
Unfortunately, he could not cut the mustard, his 
company commander. His battalion commander came

34:15.472 --> 34:20.338
up and said, I need to make a change in certain 
company. I said, that's all right with me. He said,

34:21.039 --> 34:25.044
well, the man I'm putting in is black. I said, I 
could carry less. Can he do the job? He said, I think

34:28.308 --> 34:28.929
he can. I said, that's all right with me. And yet he 
was top rated. But then I've seen whites the same

34:36.296 --> 34:42.543
way. Why'd you retire?

34:46.007 --> 34:56.179
Because I had a business that was just about to go 
broke, and I quit in 30

34:46.007 --> 34:56.179
years. And that business finally ended up costing 
me a ton of money. In fact, it broke.

35:03.872 --> 35:09.059
What business were you in? I went to Plymouth, 
Minnesota. And I ended up owning the bank with a ton

35:09.700 --> 35:24.279
of money, which it

35:09.700 --> 35:24.279
took me several years to pay off. I don't owe 
anybody a dime. What were your thoughts on when you

35:24.859 --> 35:27.623
retired? Were you ready to... Get out of the 
garbage? Not really. I like it. I like the people. I

35:38.249 --> 35:40.232
imagine I like the rank.

35:42.415 --> 35:51.388
I'm not happy I found out, being a general, that I 
had to do one thing to change. Because if I pulled a

35:53.010 --> 35:58.077
cigarette out, it would be about half a dozen 
people trying to light it. So I had to get in the

35:59.086 --> 36:01.770
habit of pulling my lighter out first. I'd rather 
light

36:01.790 --> 36:05.376
it on. But I liked

36:05.396 --> 36:11.064
it. I just didn't understand it. And I missed it 
when I got out. Now, when you were... In the

36:19.606 --> 36:37.625
military, did

36:19.606 --> 36:37.625
you think that your promotions were dependent on 
the people that you knew, or maybe in the right

36:19.606 --> 36:37.625
place at the right time, or were they more 
dependent on your own behavior, your own actions,

36:19.606 --> 36:37.625
and your accomplishments? I would hope they were 
on my own behavior and my own actions. I would hope

36:41.790 --> 36:44.192
so. Because when I got promoted to major, serving 
under a VMI sick Lieutenant Colonel, regular

36:50.538 --> 36:59.675
Army. And he picked me as his exec. He was the trial, 
because he was sick.

37:15.732 --> 37:18.915
I guess I've done a good job as Commander. Do you 
think that people get ahead in the professional

37:18.935 --> 37:26.322
world the same way that they get ahead in the 
military world?

37:26.342 --> 37:35.750
Do you think it takes the same type of attributes in 
the military as other businesses, corporations?

37:40.995 --> 37:43.377
Yes, I would say so.

37:45.263 --> 37:59.203
If an individual expects to succeed in private 
business and the military, he can't do it by just

37:45.263 --> 37:59.203
saying, issuing an order. He's got to leave.

38:03.409 --> 38:08.296
If you could never run and leave, would you define 
leadership for him? Yes, sir, if I can. Leadership

38:12.402 --> 38:14.865
is the ability to Anticipate, perhaps. Recognize 
problems.

38:22.855 --> 38:26.541
Make corrections.

38:26.561 --> 38:29.284
Try to put the right people in the right places. No 
one can do it all by themselves. And you've got to

38:32.769 --> 38:35.713
have competent people. I had so many people down at 
Fort Polk on my staff. It wasn't a question if I

38:41.341 --> 38:46.168
didn't like the guy firing him and getting him out 
and getting the other one in. I did have to make two

38:47.228 --> 38:54.077
shifts,

38:47.228 --> 38:54.077
which worked out. Because I had a man that could see 
a tree, but he couldn't

38:54.097 --> 39:00.885
see a forest. What kind of attributes do you think 
leaders should have?

39:08.695 --> 39:09.096
What kind of values? Well, he's got to have pretty 
high

39:09.116 --> 39:14.923
values. There's been an old saying that It makes no 
difference whether it's a company or a battalion

39:18.582 --> 39:28.497
or a brigade. If you've got a tough, tough 
commander, you need an exec to go around and kind of

39:28.517 --> 39:39.673
unruffle the feathers. If you've got a rather 
easygoing commander, you need a tough exec to go

39:39.693 --> 39:47.425
around and see a thing. I depend on my people. I had 
an excellent executive officer. I told the

39:55.055 --> 40:03.144
battalion commanders that we'll have meetings if 
we got something to talk about. We're not going to

40:03.164 --> 40:07.608
have daily meetings just to have daily meetings. I 
see most of you every day somewhere anyhow. My exec

40:11.151 --> 40:14.695
will have a meeting with your execs every day. But 
you understand that what goes through that

40:16.430 --> 40:24.001
channel is just the same as me telling you. And I 
saved your time. Because I don't like to have me

40:27.145 --> 40:30.630
just hear myself talk. If there's something to 
talk about, fine, we'll get together. Otherwise,

40:37.239 --> 40:39.062
get out and do your job. I suppose

40:39.683 --> 40:57.341
so. I guess everybody aspires to the next higher 
promotion. But I guess my consuming desire was to

41:04.068 --> 41:09.133
do the best job I knew how. Whatever I do.

41:16.905 --> 41:20.248
Because I figure that I'm paid to do a good job. And 
the people under me are paid to do a good job. And I

41:25.554 --> 41:32.482
feel like if they don't, it's my job to either 
correct them or get rid of them. And I had a captain

41:32.502 --> 41:38.108
down there. We were getting ready to come home. I 
told him, I said, I suggest that you transfer to

41:42.658 --> 41:56.352
another outfit somewhere because you're the last 
captain I've

41:42.658 --> 41:56.352
ever promoted. What did he do? He got out.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.643
I sent him on advance to catch me down. He wrecked 
his car.

42:12.357 --> 42:15.201
I got to investigating it. He'd had two previous 
wrecks. I can be pretty tough. I called him in, and I

42:20.989 --> 42:25.135
said, you're grounded. I will not permit you to 
have a car on this post. I said, I may not keep you

42:30.342 --> 42:34.588
from getting killed, but I may keep somebody else 
from getting killed. After three months, he came

42:36.340 --> 42:52.351
up, and I said, all right, you go down and bring me a 
prescription for new glasses

42:36.340 --> 42:52.351
from

42:36.340 --> 42:52.351
the doctor, and we'll see about it. But you can't 
win them all. Sometimes

42:55.763 --> 43:03.713
people have said that there's a military 
mentality or a military way of thinking. The Army

43:03.733 --> 43:06.616
does it one way, the civilian world does it the 
other. Is there a military mentality? Yes, I think

43:09.239 --> 43:10.821
so. What is it? Well, you're used to telling a man to 
do something and telling him how to do it, and he

43:14.226 --> 43:23.577
does it that way. There's been many things, but I 
still say leadership and civilian occupation

43:24.097 --> 43:35.512
leadership in the military is leading, not 
driving.

43:41.019 --> 43:45.806
Sir William Slim, have you ever heard of him? He was 
a British general. and in the defeat in Malaysia.

43:59.163 --> 44:07.315
And he used to talk about the military as a string of 
instruments. And he said, the finest is a

44:07.335 --> 44:11.360
battalion. I can know my people clear down the 
line. But he said, even as a general, and I have

44:19.970 --> 44:23.154
regimental commanders. I go to one and say, Jack, I 
need that hill by 10 o'clock in the morning. He

44:29.884 --> 44:30.725
says, okay. I go to the next one and I say, gosh, I'd 
love to have that hill by 10 o'clock in the morning,

44:30.745 --> 44:39.718
but I know you can't do it. He said, General, I 
believe I can.

44:45.145 --> 44:48.610
You have to know your people.

44:50.817 --> 44:56.523
You have to try to correct mistakes, just like in 
the civilian occupation. Perhaps there's a

44:56.543 --> 44:58.826
little bit firmer thing. I've seen people that 
swing their weight around. That doesn't really go

45:06.354 --> 45:09.858
in the army. You've got

45:09.878 --> 45:13.763
to wait for a while. But you have to lead

45:13.783 --> 45:19.609
people in this. You know, frailty, there's no such 
thing as a perfect soldier.

45:27.671 --> 45:31.339
You have to approach it differently. I have one 
last topic I'd like to talk about. Would you excuse

45:33.946 --> 45:36.552
me for a few minutes?

45:40.261 --> 45:43.187
Now I wanted to talk finally about one last thing. 
Those changes that we've had at A&M, did you know

45:43.267 --> 45:47.516
General Rudder? Yes, very well. What did you think 
of Earl Rudder? I thought he was a tremendous

45:52.927 --> 45:55.232
soldier.

45:59.161 --> 46:03.686
I think he came to A&M as president during the very 
prime time. You sure did. And under his tenure,

46:04.527 --> 46:09.173
there are a number of changes, and I'd like to talk 
about those. For example, ending the Mandatory

46:09.994 --> 46:12.096
Corps. What was and what is your opinion of that? It 
was a sign of the times. A&M cannot continue to be

46:19.605 --> 46:26.012
all military. and be a large state university

46:27.308 --> 46:32.874
at the same time. What about allowing women? I 
think it's one of the greatest things that could

46:33.895 --> 46:39.881
have happened. And I'll tell you what I base that 
reasoning on, two or three things. I have talked to

46:46.827 --> 46:53.394
many high school principals.

46:53.414 --> 46:55.476
And the general consensus is that Somewhere along 
the line, they will counsel with nearly every

46:56.418 --> 47:07.089
student that's going on to college. And almost 
without exception, they will recommend that go to

47:07.109 --> 47:12.955
college. Their reasoning being that if you're 
going to work with them, live with them the rest of

47:12.975 --> 47:21.143
your life, why separate?
