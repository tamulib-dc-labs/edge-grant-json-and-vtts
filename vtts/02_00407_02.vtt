WEBVTT

00:01.718 --> 00:02.559
warm up here. There

00:02.599 --> 00:12.848
is something else I want to ask you about that has a 
good deal to do with your father and his

00:02.599 --> 00:12.848
activities. I noticed on a map of Texas today that 
the Old Dolores settlement has been made into

00:12.968 --> 00:21.936
something. Is it a national or a state? It is 
recognized as a state historical site. Now, is

00:28.041 --> 00:31.084
this the Rancho Dolores or the Old Hacienda? It's 
the old hacienda. The old hacienda. Which, by the

00:34.927 --> 00:47.845
way, it was the very, very first settlement in the 
1700s here in the United States, or one of the first

00:34.927 --> 00:47.845
ones.

00:47.865 --> 00:51.591
If you will read the book that my father 
co-authored. I have. And he mentions that

00:52.492 --> 00:55.536
particularly. Which is true. That was even, the 
old, the lot of settlement was settled even before

00:56.353 --> 01:07.569
signing Nassau and any of the, definitely even 
before Laredo. That was in the 1750s. It was 1750,

01:09.758 --> 01:12.921
Jose Vasquez Borrego. That is correct. Well, then 
later, your grandfather, I believe it was, no,

01:14.343 --> 01:24.013
your great-grandfather, Cosme Martinez, 
founded the Rancho Dolores. That's correct.

01:25.174 --> 01:27.797
Which was, what, a few miles from the Hacienda? How 
far is it from the Hacienda? Well, exactly the

01:30.861 --> 01:36.947
distance, I really don't know. but it just 
relatively i would say it's a short period of time i

01:37.653 --> 02:00.235
mean short distance up the road up the road yeah not 
not by by today's standards well whatever

01:37.653 --> 02:00.235
happened to that settlement's no longer lived in 
uh no it is still you might consider it a ghost

01:37.653 --> 02:00.235
settlement now but you still have many of the old 
walls

02:01.109 --> 02:09.059
and old building sites. They're still there. 
Whatever happened to that settlement? Has it ever

02:12.523 --> 02:14.065
been set aside? It is owned by the family. And in 
this case, it belongs to Antonio Martinez and Jose

02:17.770 --> 02:27.522
Maria Martinez, who presently live in San 
Antonio. By the way, Antonio Martinez died, so

02:27.839 --> 02:35.049
it's Jose Maria Martinez and other sisters. Are 
there any children? I'm afraid not. No. So there

02:40.717 --> 02:42.259
will be some. They have nephews and nieces, and 
more than likely they will probably be the ones

02:42.960 --> 02:47.907
that eventually die. Well, I understand there was 
a little bit of controversy with the Vidauris over

02:48.072 --> 02:52.000
this. The Vidauris, that's correct. As a matter of 
fact, it was the oldest case in the 49th District

02:54.546 --> 02:59.276
Court. And just about a little better than two 
years ago, that case was finally settled. and it

03:05.926 --> 03:32.592
was settled in favor of the well how was it set 
because partially part part of the of that track

03:05.926 --> 03:32.592
was was uh settled in favor of the vidaris and the 
other part in favor of the martinez but here again

03:05.926 --> 03:32.592
my father was the one that was uh most influential 
by the testimony that he provided so yeah because

03:05.926 --> 03:32.592
it was in court for a long time it was in court for a 
better a little better than 40 years And during

03:33.027 --> 03:39.059
this period of time, I would say far more money was 
spent than the actual value of that acreage. This

03:40.822 --> 03:42.606
is not uncommon. No, that's true. Well, I wondered 
what had happened to it, because I believe the last

03:44.710 --> 03:49.078
thing I saw was in about, I guess, in the early 
1960s. It was still in litigation. That is

03:54.605 --> 03:55.006
correct. So it's finally completely out of the 
courts. It's finally completely out of the

03:57.489 --> 03:59.231
courts. It's been compromised. It's finally 
settled by the 49 District Court. Judge E.J. Gason

04:03.476 --> 04:05.298
presiding. I believe Robert Lee Bobbitt had made 
the suggestion back in about 1961 or so that it be

04:05.318 --> 04:14.970
turned over to the state of Texas as a state park. 
And I wondered if anything had ever No, nothing

04:17.003 --> 04:18.505
along those lines. That never happened. It would 
be nice if something like that would be done. And

04:23.232 --> 04:24.855
let's hope that someday it will. But that's going 
to now be in the hands of the nieces and nephews and

04:26.037 --> 04:31.906
families that live in San Antonio. That is 
correct.

04:35.431 --> 04:36.132
That is correct. Oh, by the way, whatever happened 
to Robert Lee Bobbitt? Is he still alive? He died

04:40.258 --> 04:41.240
last year. Last year. A little better than a year 
ago. And... This was after his wife died, a little

04:45.910 --> 04:50.076
later on in the death. And his son, Robert Lee 
Wilder Jr., is in practice, has a law practice in

04:50.096 --> 04:57.446
San Antonio. Was this an ongoing part of the Hicks, 
Hicks, Dixon, and Bobbitt firm, or did it finally

04:57.486 --> 05:12.306
just... No, it finally was dissolved, which many 
of the papers my father still, or still have over at

04:57.486 --> 05:12.306
the ranch. And part of it are placed over at the 
Texina archives. Which, by the way, that has a lot

05:19.751 --> 05:23.076
of history there, too. Yes, it does. Because there 
were many that the law firm for the South Texas area

05:24.258 --> 05:36.958
was this law firm of Hicks, Hicks, Dixon, and 
Bobbitt. And many land. cases were handled

05:40.737 --> 06:05.158
through this firm and they were the ones that 
settled quite a number and there's considerable

05:40.737 --> 06:05.158
amount of of information in land matters and land 
titles which are within these files so there's

05:40.737 --> 06:05.158
tremendous amount of of original or primary data 
or primary source information. There's one I'd

06:09.706 --> 06:11.269
like to ask you about. It was a big, thick file. Do 
you know anything about the Perdernal?

06:15.138 --> 06:15.799
Perdernal? Yeah. in Grant down in South Zapata 
County. Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not that well

06:21.247 --> 06:29.478
versed with it, so I think I better let it alone.

06:29.498 --> 06:31.220
Well, I know what happened to it up to 1921. I just 
wondered if it's still in existence as an entity at

06:31.380 --> 06:36.026
all. I'm afraid I don't know. You don't know. I'll 
ask around when I get to Zapata. You might ask Judge

06:40.573 --> 06:43.256
Bravo. Judge Bravo would probably know.

06:49.908 --> 06:52.330
Well, I'd like to ask a little bit more about your 
mother. Well,

06:52.350 --> 06:56.254
let's see. She was born in the 1890s, wasn't she? 
Yes, ma'am. That's correct. When did she die? She

07:03.061 --> 07:05.463
died six months after my father did. After your 
father. And she, like I mentioned before, she was

07:07.585 --> 07:14.572
born in Old Guerrero, Tamaulipas, Mexico. His 
father was a merchant by the name of Tomas Treviño.

07:20.401 --> 07:23.084
And Don Tomas, again, died. He was in his 80s at the 
time, I understand, when he died. And my mother

07:31.552 --> 07:38.299
married twice prior to my father. And he lived in, 
after she moved from Guerrero, she lived in

07:38.339 --> 07:45.946
Olzapata. And from there, she came down to Laredo 
when he married my father. Do you know when she

07:49.915 --> 07:53.019
moved to Old Zapata? I'm afraid I couldn't tell 
you. That's the thing about it, though, that my

07:54.221 --> 08:04.575
mother was, she really did not have the historical 
interest that my father had. And consequently,

08:04.855 --> 08:12.506
there were many things that were left unanswered, 
you might say. Well, was this fairly typical of

08:13.387 --> 08:16.551
women of her generation? That's right. That's 
right. She was the type that, you know, more or less

08:18.086 --> 08:28.716
was rather reserved, rather quiet, and would stay 
in the background, this type of attitude. Again,

08:28.736 --> 08:32.500
the Spanish influence, the Mexican attitude. But 
there was a woman in your family who was apparently

08:32.660 --> 08:44.712
not at all like that, the mother of Blas Maria 
Uribe. All right, that's Doña Jesusita. Doña

08:46.971 --> 08:52.138
Jesusita, who came from Guerrero after she was 
widowed with two young sons. No, that's Blas Maria

08:54.200 --> 08:57.325
Uribe. Doña Jesusita was his daughter. Was his 
daughter, that's right, who was my father's

08:59.708 --> 09:03.893
mother. But I'm talking about Blas Maria's 
mother. Do you remember any family stories about

09:07.959 --> 09:10.362
her? She's the one that came with two sons, a widow, 
apparently a fairly young woman, crossed the

09:10.763 --> 09:19.976
river and went to live in, do you call it Uribeño? 
Uribeño. Uribeño. Uribeño. That's right. A very

09:23.000 --> 09:24.583
strong-willed woman. That is correct. And she was 
the one that initially was responsible for that

09:26.645 --> 09:33.075
particular settlement. Now she actually founded 
it herself. Well, to a great extent. And her sons

09:37.072 --> 09:39.115
weren't old enough to be much help. No, they were 
very much still in diapers, so I hear, or so I was

09:39.255 --> 09:47.107
told. Have you ever heard any explanation for the 
kind of woman she was for that day and time? I'm

09:54.738 --> 09:55.699
afraid not. I would say that here you would have to 
go to some of the Uribe's And we get a little bit more

10:01.490 --> 10:04.556
information in that area. By the way, mentioning 
Uribe's,

10:05.157 --> 10:24.392
there's a man by the name of Derli Uribe, whose son, 
Jorge Uribe, has made a family tree on the Uribe

10:05.157 --> 10:24.392
site. And this family tree dates back to 200 years, 
to the 1770s.

10:37.589 --> 10:40.852
And it's a good-sized wall. And in this particular 
family tree, he traces it all the way through and

10:42.254 --> 10:56.269
includes, wherever possible, not only the date of 
birth, but the date of death, and all the children

10:42.254 --> 10:56.269
that follow thereafter. And he has been able to 
trace it through one generation beyond the

10:57.143 --> 11:04.831
Uribes. For instance, my father was a Martinez 
Uribe. So he traced it on through my generation.

11:14.701 --> 11:15.742
And that's where he stops. Now, how did he derive 
his interest in genealogy? Or do you know that?

11:21.087 --> 11:22.549
Again, because of the family. Well, now, you talk 
to people, and this is true. both in Mexico and in

11:27.029 --> 11:30.373
the United States. And you talk to a great many 
people, and they don't know who their family is

11:30.693 --> 11:36.860
beyond their grandparents. And then ever so 
often, you find a family where this interest in

11:37.600 --> 11:44.788
genealogy just goes all the way back. It's true of 
my mother's family in Charleston that I was

11:44.868 --> 11:48.452
telling you about. They go back. They take the 
march all the way across Kentucky and the whole

11:49.293 --> 11:52.817
thing. Now, just from your observations, why do 
you think your family has retained this kind of

11:53.033 --> 12:01.762
interest? Can you think of any reason when a lot of 
other families don't? Well, I would imagine the

12:05.727 --> 12:12.814
reason why is because we are one of the descendants 
of the original settlers. And normally this, I

12:13.195 --> 12:18.180
guess, this interest stays with the family all 
along. which was the case with the original

12:18.447 --> 12:23.313
settlers in Old Dolores and in San Ignacio. That's 
also true of my family, interestingly. They were

12:27.137 --> 12:31.922
the original settlers of Charleston, Missouri, 
and little towns in that area. And this is the

12:31.942 --> 12:35.306
reason, I guess, why you have that interest. You 
can't help but be proud of the fact that your

12:36.187 --> 12:44.016
family, somewhere down the line, was responsible 
for a settlement. And in this case, our family was

12:44.418 --> 12:50.771
responsible for a settlement in the 1700s. And

12:50.891 --> 13:05.802
when my great-great-grandfather got this land, 
which was deeded by the king of Spain, he

12:50.891 --> 13:05.802
originally got a little better than 200,000 acres 
of land. And naturally by all the... This is Jesus.

13:11.006 --> 13:11.766
Don Jesus. Don Jesus. That's right. He actually 
bought it from the heirs of Borrego. Borrego.

13:15.731 --> 13:16.973
Borrego, yeah. And then that deed was from the king 
of Spain. From the king of Spain. And so this,

13:20.717 --> 13:36.075
again, is probably the reason why we always have a 
tendency to be proud of it and make sure that we do

13:20.717 --> 13:36.075
have that family history or the family tree or the 
family background. Well, one thing I've

13:36.697 --> 13:39.872
suspected myself, collecting these 
genealogies, and I'm sort of speculating on tape.

13:44.653 --> 13:52.184
But in every case that I've found this extensive 
knowledge of family, it has been landed families.

13:53.386 --> 13:59.855
And I just wonder if this might have something to do 
with it, a need to keep track of the land. That very

13:59.895 --> 14:01.737
well possibly would be. I suppose you still have 
lands in Zapata County and cousins with lands.

14:09.308 --> 14:10.129
That's great. What about cousin marriage? You say 
your mother and father were first cousins. What

14:14.834 --> 14:15.915
about your mother and father? I'm sorry, your 
father's first and second wives were his first

14:15.935 --> 14:18.999
cousins. That is correct. They were first 
cousins. Was this common? Very common. And again,

14:22.382 --> 14:33.595
we come back again to the principle that they did 
not want the land to be divested with any greater

14:22.382 --> 14:33.595
number of people that were considered outsiders. 
Again, that's a feeling. They wanted to keep the

14:36.704 --> 14:47.396
land within a certain group or a certain family and 
try to keep as many other people to have an interest

14:36.704 --> 14:47.396
in it. So I guess that's the reason primarily why we 
come back again to the same, why cousins married

14:48.518 --> 15:00.371
cousins, even though they were first cousins, 
which was the case with my father. Well, I had an

15:00.391 --> 15:01.733
explanation. given to me by one of my relatives, 
which was a strong suspicion that they only

15:02.067 --> 15:12.481
thought that cousins were good enough for them.

15:12.501 --> 15:14.764
Because again, the patterning is there. The 
tremendous amount of cousin marriage, I think,

15:14.824 --> 15:20.852
was primarily third cousin Second and third 
cousin marriage, but it was still generation

15:21.052 --> 15:26.661
after generation of cousin marriage. So this is 
quite prevalent, very strong. But it's, again,

15:32.410 --> 15:38.740
something that tends to be found in, I think, 
settling families who have land. I still have a

15:39.221 --> 15:42.486
number of cousins. that are married to cousins. 
And if you will go to San Ignacio and ask, and you

15:46.771 --> 15:57.946
will find most of the Uribe's are married to 
Uribe's, are Martinez and Uribe's, but they're

15:46.771 --> 15:57.946
all cousins. Now your wife, is she any kind at all? 
No. What is her name? Ancita. Ancita. But I must say

16:03.413 --> 16:05.976
though that During my adolescent period, my 
father tried to instill this into me, which I don't

16:07.947 --> 16:15.616
think I ever paid too much attention. But he kept 
on. He was the most instrumental. The fact that he

16:20.222 --> 16:24.547
was retired, he had a considerable amount of time. 
And he was very influential, because I always felt

16:24.567 --> 16:32.877
very close to my father, even though there was 
considerable difference in ages. How old was he

16:33.178 --> 16:34.880
when you were born? He was 60 when I was born. Really 
quite old. Did he ever talk to you about what it

16:39.182 --> 16:43.909
meant to him to have children so late in life? Oh, 
yes. He was extremely proud. He was extremely

16:47.113 --> 16:50.118
proud of me. And he always had more than enough time 
for me. And everywhere he went, I always tagged

16:56.427 --> 17:01.895
along, or he would always make it a point to bring me 
along. And it was all during this time that he would

17:03.477 --> 17:06.962
try to, He used his philosophy on me. But I'm afraid 
that particular philosophy never works. I try to

17:13.950 --> 17:17.054
stay within the family. I dated a seventh cousin. 
That didn't work either.

17:23.722 --> 17:29.629
His philosophy, what do you think his philosophy 
was, if you were to talk about his philosophy of

17:23.722 --> 17:29.629
life?

17:32.412 --> 17:34.735
He was a man that had a lot of foresight. He was quite 
optimistic. And he definitely was an aggressive

17:38.667 --> 17:49.524
man as far as his ability and initiative to do 
things. And even though he was small in stature, he

17:51.427 --> 18:04.607
definitely was tall or big in attitude and ideas.

18:05.212 --> 18:10.121
the manner in which he himself believed in the 
future. And the fact remains that he was, I would

18:11.543 --> 18:25.669
say, one of the first ones, if not the first one, to 
have a formal education and still come back to his

18:11.543 --> 18:25.669
original town. Did any of his brothers and sisters 
go to college? The youngest brother went to

18:29.495 --> 18:32.420
college, but he never graduated. Did your father 
have anything to do with that? Yes. He was the one

18:36.407 --> 18:38.792
that paid for his schooling. He would send them 
also to St. Edward's. And he was out there for about

18:42.518 --> 18:44.762
a year and a half. But that youngest brother was a 
processor. He died before my father did.

18:53.575 --> 18:56.082
Processo, did he ever marry? No, he never did. 
Well, that's something I'm a little curious

18:57.846 --> 19:00.453
about. Maybe you could enlighten me. I've noticed 
in the genealogies in your father's papers that

19:02.619 --> 19:09.998
there are a great many people who didn't marry and 
particularly I would say in the generation that

19:10.552 --> 19:16.139
was about your father's age. There would be 
families of five to ten children or more and maybe

19:16.700 --> 19:23.668
one or two of them would marry. Do you have any idea 
why this particular phenomena? I don't know. I can

19:33.842 --> 19:35.324
only speculate. And what I can speculate is this, 
that we come back again to this business of if one of

19:35.724 --> 19:56.111
the family would be dating somebody that did not 
belong, let's say, to the family, which again is

19:35.724 --> 19:56.111
part of the cousin thing, probably they would 
frown on him. And if there wasn't a cousin good

19:56.131 --> 20:01.078
enough to marry, then they definitely wouldn't 
marry, or at least their parents would be

20:01.396 --> 20:05.723
influential enough not to let them marry. I guess, 
now again, this is speculation on my part. Well,

20:11.593 --> 20:13.456
I'm not sure. I'd have to, you know, take it to the 
computer or something, but I think that I think

20:18.305 --> 20:36.988
there was a much higher percentage of children, 
and I'm thinking about some of the other

20:18.305 --> 20:36.988
genealogies your father collected that were 
other families along the river, that back say in

20:18.305 --> 20:36.988
the 1700s and 1800s that most of the children did 
marry. for the most part, but that it was in this

20:37.272 --> 20:47.024
generation of the late 1900s that there started 
being so many people who didn't marry. Now, like I

20:47.064 --> 20:50.187
say, this is just impressionistic. I can't show 
you statistics on it. And I wonder if anything

20:52.951 --> 21:01.481
happened at that time in addition to this family 
thing that would have limited the number of people

20:52.951 --> 21:01.481
getting married. I wish I could give you some 
background there, but I'm afraid I don't have any.

21:08.103 --> 21:09.525
Well, I've speculated, too. I've wondered about 
the land being subdivided, say, one time too many

21:09.585 --> 21:14.910
or something. But you'd never heard anything 
spoken to this effect. No. That's a good question.

21:23.059 --> 21:24.461
Well, it was an interesting thing. I looked at it 
and wondered if there was any real reason. Because

21:28.485 --> 21:37.755
I had a few, I call them uncles, which were first 
cousins of my father that didn't marry. And they

21:39.676 --> 21:55.657
definitely had accumulated considerable 
wealth, but yet they didn't have any children in

21:39.676 --> 21:55.657
which they would leave other than nephews and 
nieces. So the land that they accumulated then

21:56.198 --> 21:59.362
would go to the nephews and nieces. That is 
correct. And be subdivided. Right. Now, the

22:02.238 --> 22:07.846
situation now, there are very many families that 
have very large holdings. Are most of the holdings

22:08.166 --> 22:10.870
fairly small by this time? By this time, 
especially in that area, they are relatively

22:11.271 --> 22:15.156
small. The only ones that are large, and we come 
back now to a different area. We come here now to

22:22.286 --> 22:32.160
Webb County, and that's a Benavides family,

22:22.286 --> 22:32.160
the Doña Rosa Benavides. They own upwards of 
100,000 acres of land. And that is land that has

22:37.295 --> 22:42.181
been inherited over the years. And right now, she 
has two grandsons, one by the name of Carlos Y.

22:43.002 --> 22:53.454
Benavidez Jr. and the other one, Arturo N. 
Benavidez. And this is about the largest, acreage

23:01.520 --> 23:07.467
that I can think of that has been deeded over a 
period of generations.

23:09.950 --> 23:23.005
But as far as from my family, most of the acreage, 
the greatest number I would say is about, you'd

23:09.950 --> 23:23.005
think in terms of 10 or 12,000, possibly at the most 
15,000 acres of land. I inherited a little better,

23:24.267 --> 23:32.156
just right around 4,000, which I consider small by 
our standards. Well, let's consider it by how many

23:32.176 --> 23:36.061
cattle you can graze on it. How many cattle can you 
run on 4,000 acres of Zapata County land? Well,

23:41.647 --> 23:47.474
again, we come back again to how well improved the 
acreage is. If it's open land, grazing land, then

23:51.183 --> 23:54.989
you think in terms of 20 to 25 acres per head. If you 
have highly improved land that's root plowed,

23:56.070 --> 24:12.836
seeded either with buffelgrass or something 
along that line, and has plenty of water, well,

23:56.070 --> 24:12.836
then you definitely cut down tremendously as to 
the number of acres that you need per head. In other

24:13.116 --> 24:18.264
words, it takes a pretty high capital input on this 
land to do much with it. That's right. Well, now,

24:19.195 --> 24:32.035
the land itself, from old family stories, do you 
have any idea what it was like in terms of

24:19.195 --> 24:32.035
vegetation when the first settlers, well, say, 
when Jesus Trevino came in 1830? It was very hard,

24:32.196 --> 24:35.280
very, very hard. And this is the reason, too, why, 
again... Very hard. In the sense that, I mean, here

24:39.667 --> 24:46.418
you did not have the type of... this was more arid 
land. That's what I'm thinking of. A land that did

24:52.420 --> 24:56.706
not have too much water. And again, that's the 
reason why whenever they would have partition

24:58.008 --> 25:15.173
deeds on some of this acreage, they would always 
make it a point that they would have a lane that

24:58.008 --> 25:15.173
would lead all the way down to the river just to make 
sure that there would be direct access to water. by

25:16.030 --> 25:17.112
the same reason. So this was very arid land. Now, 
today the things are very different because we

25:19.817 --> 25:27.412
have Falcon Lake on one end and then Amistad Dam on 
the other. And these two great bodies of water have

25:28.193 --> 25:32.622
provided a greater humidity in the atmosphere, 
which brings in more rain. You've really got the

25:39.907 --> 25:43.694
meteorological records on this. It's actually 
been raining more. Yes ma'am, that's right. And we

25:46.700 --> 25:50.166
didn't have this then, or they didn't have this. So 
definitely the country here was drier and the

25:50.847 --> 25:57.259
rains were few and far between. And you had to make 
sure that there would be some access to water. And

26:02.164 --> 26:14.175
this is the reason why you have many of these, all of 
the land grants and all of the partitions, they

26:02.164 --> 26:14.175
start at the river and go east from there. Just 
making sure that all of them have direct access to

26:14.976 --> 26:20.462
the Rio Grande. Do you know how big the original 
pociones were? The original Porciones, I

26:24.323 --> 26:27.808
understand. Well, you're asking me now something 
I knew but I forgot. But they were very, very large.

26:35.981 --> 26:41.990
Well, on the map, just by measuring it, I 
calculated they must be about a mile wide and about

26:35.981 --> 26:41.990
11 miles deep. But I was just measuring on the map. 
Does that sound about right? Well, they were about

26:47.299 --> 26:49.943
or probably a little wider than that. A little 
wider than a mile. That's right. That's right. And

26:52.996 --> 26:56.079
something like 11 miles. Something like that. 
That's correct. Because they really went in

26:57.600 --> 27:00.824
further deep from the river. Very, very deep. And 
then the lands beyond that, beyond the Porcionis,

27:04.508 --> 27:12.135
when did they start being parceled out, or do you 
know? I'm afraid I don't have any idea. You're

27:14.177 --> 27:20.143
asking an individual that does not have that much 
of a background in history as my father did, which

27:14.177 --> 27:20.143
is bad. I realize that. I wish I had... Well, I'm 
asking you every question I can think of right now

27:21.817 --> 27:33.434
that has popped into my mind, and you know a lot of 
them you've answered beautifully, so I might as

27:21.817 --> 27:33.434
well keep on asking. Fine. Well, let's see, the 
Porciones, they were the Webb County or the

27:34.436 --> 27:43.529
Porciones of Laredo, and then there was the big 
José Vázquez Borrego. The José Vázquez Borrego

27:44.170 --> 27:47.014
grant was divided into... the San Ignacio 
subdivision, the Dolores subdivision, and the

27:47.315 --> 27:54.825
Corralito subdivision. And they were bigger than 
Porciones. Very much so. Very much. That's right.

28:00.333 --> 28:05.260
And the land down there, one thing I did wonder 
about was the vegetation. Has it changed any since

28:05.280 --> 28:07.723
Falcon Dam went in? Yes. You now are able to see 
quite a bit of green in that area that used to be very

28:08.725 --> 28:16.275
arid. And, of course, the improvements that have 
been made now by bringing in buffled grass, which

28:16.913 --> 28:27.324
is a new type of grass that was introduced not too 
many years ago. Well, what about the irrigation

28:27.885 --> 28:29.506
rights? For a time, it looked like, from some of the 
newspaper articles in your father's paper, that

28:29.586 --> 28:38.236
they weren't going to get any irrigation rights. 
Was this changed? Did they get irrigation rights

28:39.277 --> 28:42.040
from these? Well, yes, but only those people that 
were using. the river for irrigation. The people

28:48.055 --> 28:59.531
that did not use or didn't have it, any uses and were 
not able to prove that they used it over a period of

28:48.055 --> 28:59.531
years, they lost their water rights. So this is a 
case. Now what was the justification for them

29:02.435 --> 29:09.145
losing the water rights since that was one of the 
things that the dam was built for? Well, this was a

29:09.749 --> 29:23.569
ruling of the Texas Water Commission, and that's 
the reason why the Texas Water Commission was

29:09.749 --> 29:23.569
created, to supervise the irrigation and the 
usage of water usage. And those people that never

29:24.851 --> 29:38.271
took advantage of these water rights prior to the 
dam and did not set up any kind of

29:38.555 --> 29:39.457
How should I say it? Irrigation? Irrigation 
system. They simply did not, simply lost their

29:42.042 --> 29:46.472
water rights. Excuse me. Yes, sir. Can I just, let 
me just interrupt one second. I'm trying to find a

29:52.404 --> 29:54.288
book here. Sure. Right here. Oh, that's all right, 
Harry. Thank you.

30:02.298 --> 30:11.066
Well, did your father have anything to do with 
helping people establish their irrigation

30:02.298 --> 30:11.066
rights? Not that much. I'm afraid that this was 
finally settled not too long ago, after my father

30:12.348 --> 30:18.153
had died.

30:20.876 --> 30:27.482
We must keep in mind that this is a relatively new 
agency that was created just several years ago.

30:28.603 --> 30:30.685
But at the time, it was a hot issue that was were 
originally brought by the people from the valley.

30:36.147 --> 30:38.752
They were the ones that initially started this 
litigation. Well, was this applied in the valley,

30:38.772 --> 30:40.596
too? This rule was applied also in the valley. Was 
there any particular group of people that lost out

30:44.755 --> 30:50.300
more than any others on this? Not that I'm aware of. 
It just was sort of a catch-as-catch-can kind of

30:52.021 --> 30:55.765
thing. That's right. That's very interesting. 
About the tourism aspects, your father spent a lot

30:59.388 --> 31:07.175
of time guiding people down to San Ignacio and this 
sort of thing. How did he happen to develop his

31:07.735 --> 31:13.480
interest in history?

31:15.080 --> 31:43.011
his well he initially acquired it uh through the 
interest that he had from from his own father who by

31:15.080 --> 31:43.011
the way was was used quite extensively as a witness 
again to settle land titles uh i know that mr he

31:15.080 --> 31:43.011
would relate a number of occasions where mr robert 
lee bobbitt would use him as a principal witness,

31:43.480 --> 31:48.847
would use my grandfather as a principal witness. 
And this was part of the influence, I would

31:50.689 --> 31:57.317
imagine, where he acquired. And he spent a 
considerable period of time in reviewing the

31:58.979 --> 32:06.568
local folklore and the local history. Local 
folklore. Now, there was very little in your

32:08.451 --> 32:12.135
father's papers that I would call folklore. It was 
pretty much, you know, history. And even in the

32:15.780 --> 32:22.348
book, The Kingdom of Zapata, it was primarily 
history rather than what I would call folklore.

32:22.809 --> 32:27.114
What, in your opinion, is some of the folklore of 
the region? Well,

32:28.696 --> 32:33.822
how could I explain that? I don't know whether some 
of the writings that you see that... See, my father

32:36.417 --> 32:52.373
was a musician, and he really was a musician at 
heart.

32:53.534 --> 33:05.226
And over time and again, my grandfather would make 
sure that his sons, who one of them, of course, my

32:53.534 --> 33:05.226
father used to... play the violin. His other 
brother, Elgosio, used to play the guitar, and his

33:08.529 --> 33:16.677
third brother used to play the accordion. And my 
grandfather would always take them along to the

33:17.958 --> 33:27.727
different ranches in order to make these violins. 
And all the people from the surrounding area would

33:28.968 --> 33:32.732
be invited. this would bring in the atmosphere. 
And there was a number of ocurridos that would be,

33:38.461 --> 33:59.108
how should I say, composed during that time, 
especially more so during periods where

33:38.461 --> 33:59.108
political activity was very high. there's a 
number of versos or verses that relate to some of

33:59.915 --> 34:09.147
these political eras or periods. And this is part 
of the, anyway. This is part of the tradition of

34:14.815 --> 34:19.101
keeping local history in the area, isn't it? And at 
the bailes, what kind of music do they play? What

34:22.986 --> 34:24.227
kind of music?

34:27.191 --> 34:28.453
From waltzes? to a great extent. And we used to call 
them

34:31.025 --> 34:40.904
,, which are get your partner, you know, and swing 
around. Like square dances. Square dance. Except

34:43.469 --> 34:45.853
that they used to refer to them as . And

34:45.873 --> 34:52.045
again, you know, actual The kind of a song that used 
to be normally, as a general rule, had some history

34:53.324 --> 35:00.152
behind it. I mean, it had some story to tell. This, 
to him, was one area that he always loved, he always

35:03.456 --> 35:09.763
enjoyed. And up to the time of his death, he always, 
every once in a while, would get his guitar

35:20.189 --> 35:26.996
strum a few pieces of songs that he used to sing way 
back when. And he always made it quite

35:27.016 --> 35:28.938
interesting. So he kept his interest in music all 
of his life? Oh, all the time, all the time. Did you

35:33.723 --> 35:34.784
ever learn to play? I'm afraid

35:35.244 --> 35:40.510
not. The bailes, were these, are they still held? I 
don't know. I really don't think so, other than in

35:47.132 --> 35:54.709
the towns, but not the way they were held, which 
were in the ranchos. And especially more so, like I

35:54.969 --> 36:02.987
say, when we go back to the time when a political 
year was high, and they would try to bring in, they

36:03.710 --> 36:13.020
would bring in the people by this by list, and then 
this is how they would draw in the people and the

36:03.710 --> 36:13.020
votes. And then from there, they'd take them over 
to go in and vote. To the polls. Hey, that's a

36:18.045 --> 36:19.987
painless way to do things. That's right. Well, 
now, the politics of the area, was it pretty much

36:21.128 --> 36:29.717
controlled locally in Zapata County, or was it 
pretty tied in with Webb County? No, it was pretty

36:29.782 --> 36:32.506
much controlled in Zapata County. In Zapata 
County. And this is part of the reason, too, why

36:33.407 --> 36:37.894
they call it the Kingdom of Zapata, because of 
politics. It was pretty controlled. And it was

36:39.416 --> 36:40.938
during the era of A.P. Spahn. Yeah. What kind of man 
was he? Well, he was another George Barr, so I

36:44.343 --> 36:47.908
understand. What kind of man was Judge Parr? He's 
the one that controlled the politics of that area,

36:51.466 --> 36:57.794
and nothing could be done unless he had say-so 
there. Well, would you call him a benevolent or a

36:58.034 --> 37:02.259
non-benevolent dictator then? I would say he's 
benevolent. But still, dictator wouldn't be an

37:05.503 --> 37:09.087
inappropriate word? I don't know, because I, to 
some degree, believe in all those things. I was

37:15.618 --> 37:17.681
raised in that philosophy. Oh, yeah, okay. In 
other words, a strong figure. A strong figure. An

37:21.987 --> 37:23.690
authoritarian figure. An authoritarian figure. 
Well, was he, would you have called him a good man? I

37:29.418 --> 37:33.884
would imagine, based on my father's comments, I 
think he was a good man. How did Spohn, now where was

37:34.225 --> 37:38.010
he from originally? Well, he came up from the east. 
Is that a German name? I think it is a German name.

37:43.479 --> 37:44.683
And how did he get there? He married a local lady 
there. And that's how he got involved in local

37:49.145 --> 37:53.311
politics. And he was one of the few people that 
spoke English.

37:58.659 --> 38:00.482
I presume he also learned Spanish. Oh, very much 
so. But his ability to speak English was, I

38:02.084 --> 38:05.108
suppose, an asset. Well, now say up to 1900, how 
many people in Zapata County spoke English? Very

38:12.078 --> 38:12.579
few. Very few. and say, when did English become, or 
is it? How many people are there now who don't speak

38:18.016 --> 38:20.460
English? Oh, there's a lot of people that don't 
speak English. And like I say, the

38:24.225 --> 38:33.197
Mexican-American is very predominant in this 
area. What about the schools? Is Spanish taught in

38:36.221 --> 38:38.505
the schools, too? It is taught in the schools, and 
the problem is that it's spoken. more so than

38:43.010 --> 38:44.592
English is. And it's a problem because they don't 
get to practice the English the way they should.

38:50.298 --> 38:52.560
But they do learn to read and write Spanish. Well, 
that's my understanding. I learned to read and

38:56.084 --> 39:01.590
write strictly to a great extent at the beginning 
on my own. Then I took a course or two, but really not

39:01.830 --> 39:06.996
that much of a formal education. Well, it's not 
taught in the younger grades then. It is now being

39:09.250 --> 39:10.772
taught. It is now. But when you were going to 
school, it wasn't. It wasn't. Now the bilingual

39:15.297 --> 39:20.583
program is very strong, quite predominant now. 
And the emphasis is there. So many of these

39:24.228 --> 39:30.575
students are now being taught in both languages, 
which is good. Oh, heaven, yes. Why have to wait

39:32.758 --> 39:37.283
until you get to college and go into your first 
Spanish class? Yeah, now this is something that I

39:39.203 --> 39:51.761
think is interesting, that there was an 
educational system in Zapata County very early,

39:39.203 --> 39:51.761
but it was predominantly Spanish. And

39:51.821 --> 39:56.427
your father was a teacher there. He was for about, 
like I said, for several years before he went ranch

39:57.128 --> 40:03.237
town into other areas. What made politics such a, 
how would you say, a fierce sort of thing in the

40:03.858 --> 40:10.909
area? There were, I would imagine, different 
groups that wanted to have control. But if

40:21.006 --> 40:23.931
everybody was kin, were these partly family 
feuds? That's right. To some degree, they were

40:24.772 --> 40:30.321
family feuds.

40:30.723 --> 40:43.522
That's a problem even nowadays in Zapata County, 
that you have basically one cousin running

40:30.723 --> 40:43.522
against another cousin. And the bad part about it 
is that they take it quite personally, and then

40:43.542 --> 40:51.414
they don't talk to each other. That sounds like 
Charleston again. Well, it's still predominant.

40:57.027 --> 40:58.269
It's still very predominant. So this actually 
creates dissension between families. When you

41:02.695 --> 41:06.340
get family lines, then, that are on opposite 
political sides.

41:09.324 --> 41:10.726
Very similar place. No wonder you acquired a 
considerable interest in our local history. It

41:17.376 --> 41:19.579
sounded familiar. It also sounds like a little 
town of Zitosto in Mexico that was one of the towns

41:20.285 --> 41:33.920
that I studied that was predominantly, rather 
than being an Indian town, it was predominantly

41:20.285 --> 41:33.920
Spanish. Well, a lot of people had originally 
been, or their forebearers had been Indians, but

41:34.160 --> 41:42.850
it was very much part of Mexican society, and there 
were quite a few very wealthy people. Well,

41:43.083 --> 41:46.375
several very wealthy families that had all the 
land. And again, you get the same pattern, the

41:46.456 --> 41:51.996
cousin marriages and the subdivision of the lands 
and the local politics and the whole, you know, the

41:52.128 --> 41:58.236
whole thing. So it is interesting. Well, I'm sure 
there are probably 14 questions that I haven't

42:03.602 --> 42:18.000
asked that I'd like to, and I'll think about them, 
or I'll realize what they are as soon as I turn this

42:03.602 --> 42:18.000
off.

42:22.891 --> 42:24.507
but I didn't write any of them down. Let me turn it to 
Lake College. I can't recall the name of this

42:28.409 --> 42:41.541
sister, but she did a considerable amount of 
research in local folklore and songs and corridos

42:28.409 --> 42:41.541
this time. And this was, I would say, 15 years or so 
ago. This particular sister from Marley the Lake

42:46.626 --> 42:56.475
came over and taped my father's songs in my 
father's voice. And they are on record, as is my

42:57.113 --> 43:02.222
understanding. And that would be at Lady of the 
Lake? Our Lady of the Lake College in San Antonio.

43:09.075 --> 43:16.568
And there's a number of pieces that my father 
played, accompanied by himself in his own guitar.

43:17.830 --> 43:19.273
It's a 12-string guitar. that he sang and this 
particular sister recorded. They were done over

43:28.994 --> 43:31.423
at my father's house.
