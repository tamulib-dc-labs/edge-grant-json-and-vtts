00:01.938 --> 00:09.393
This is an interview with Lieutenant General 
James Hollingsworth up at Hearst, Texas. Today is

00:10.996 --> 00:18.151
Wednesday, the 18th of August, 1982.

00:18.872 --> 00:23.862
The first thing I'd like to ask you to do is donate. 
Would you please donate this tape and all the

00:24.365 --> 00:31.594
information on this tape to Texas A&M University? 
I'd be happy to do that. Okay, now let's start right

00:33.636 --> 00:39.003
now with your early years. You were born here in 
Texas. Could you tell me about your parents?

00:47.473 --> 00:47.914
Yes, sir. I was born on the 24th of March, 1918.

00:58.975 --> 01:10.405
the first son of James Newton Hollingsworth and 
Mamie Ella Hollingsworth.

01:10.425 --> 01:27.700
They were the sole owners of a small ranch and farm

01:10.425 --> 01:27.700
seven miles north and west of Sanger, Texas.

01:30.683 --> 01:59.323
property was

01:30.683 --> 01:59.323
in located in Denton and Cook County crossing the 
borders between the two counties

01:30.683 --> 01:59.323
in the Union Hill community area

01:30.683 --> 01:59.323
I uh

02:05.058 --> 02:19.337
Went to school some one mile away to the Union Hill 
School, which consists of three teachers and

02:05.058 --> 02:19.337
three rooms.

02:23.723 --> 02:31.774
Through the eighth grade,

02:23.723 --> 02:31.774
I walked to school.

02:35.163 --> 02:41.431
rain or shine or mud or snow or whatever it might be.

02:44.675 --> 03:04.360
In those days you carried your lunch in a small pail

02:44.675 --> 03:04.360
and the lunch was usually made up of the leftovers 
from breakfast.

03:08.153 --> 03:14.621
Which could very well be two biscuits and two 
pieces of sausage.

03:24.473 --> 03:30.481
Or a light few pieces of bacon and biscuits.

03:33.444 --> 03:35.206
Was your father a farmer, though? My father was a 
farmer. and

03:37.482 --> 03:44.873
the hardest working man I've ever met in my life. 
Tell me more about him. What kind of character was

03:46.375 --> 03:47.877
he? He was a very strong-charactered man, a very 
disciplined man. He had moved from Alabama to

03:53.325 --> 04:06.645
Texas with his parents when he was about age

04:11.148 --> 04:39.315
ten and

04:11.148 --> 04:39.315
uh his father paid cash for this three hundred 
acres of land and

04:11.148 --> 04:39.315
uh

04:11.148 --> 04:39.315
my fathers my grandfather and his my grandmother 
raised

04:40.358 --> 04:49.527
one daughter and seven sons, of which my father was 
the oldest. He was a very strong man, a

04:51.910 --> 05:10.028
self-educated man, had been through the third 
grade formal schooling, and had read everything

04:51.910 --> 05:10.028
that he could get his hands on. and I shall always 
remember they subscribed. My mother had, my

05:14.662 --> 05:29.002
father was 44 years old when I was born, and my 
mother was much younger, 20 years or more younger

05:14.662 --> 05:29.002
than my father. And he was a disciplinarian in the 
sense that not, As most civilians understand

05:40.754 --> 05:50.685
discipline, you know, in civilian side of life, 
most civilians treat discipline as a punishment.

05:50.705 --> 05:53.067
Well, discipline isn't a punishment. Discipline 
is the art of learning, learning to do things well.

05:58.353 --> 06:09.225
And in that extent, he was a disciplinarian 
because he insisted that the children learn to do

05:58.353 --> 06:09.225
things well. and honesty and integrity and to 
stand up for what you believe in. And that's the

06:19.567 --> 06:22.891
kind of a man he was. How about your mother? My 
mother was a wonderful woman who, as I say, much

06:24.733 --> 06:38.267
younger than my father, who was out of a Scottish 
family. of Browning's.

06:43.303 --> 06:47.709
Her father and mother were more or less 
sharecroppers. Since my father was a landowner, I

06:49.591 --> 07:08.254
think that I could see a little resentment at times 
to the

06:49.591 --> 07:08.254
basic philosophy of my mother's father and 
mother. to his. For example, I've heard him say at

07:12.440 --> 07:37.903
times that socialism is the worst thing in the 
world and that free enterprise and ownership and I

07:12.440 --> 07:37.903
guess the thing that he hated worst was to have to 
borrow money in order maybe to put in a part of a crop

07:38.153 --> 07:42.839
or to buy a piece of equipment or something like 
that. He hated that worse than anything. He was one

07:44.601 --> 07:51.551
who felt like that if you don't have the money to pay 
for it, that doesn't represent true ownership.

07:53.233 --> 08:01.984
So, he and of course my mother were just worked 
themselves to death, so to speak. I remember that

08:02.565 --> 08:07.772
from the time I was six years old.

08:08.950 --> 08:37.101
But I could always, when I was a little larger, I 
could detect that sensitivity to his

08:08.950 --> 08:37.101
feelings toward,

08:08.950 --> 08:37.101
and he never made any derogatory remarks about my 
mother's family being sharecroppers because

08:08.950 --> 08:37.101
they had a large family too, 12 or 13. children, and 
they all married well. Some married preachers,

08:41.593 --> 08:50.701
some married farmers, some married

08:41.593 --> 08:50.701
day laborers and this sort of stuff. But my mom was 
just a magnificent person that did everything and

08:51.142 --> 09:03.593
worked so hard doing everything, you know, on the 
farm, cooking. Some days she'd go to the fields

09:03.833 --> 09:06.075
with us. when I was large enough to go to the field 
and work, particularly during the harvest, the

09:06.882 --> 09:15.234
grain, the cotton, the corn. I suppose when I was 
seven years old, I was walking a mile to the north of

09:15.354 --> 09:33.980
our pasture land through the fields in order to 
drive in the herd of cattle for the evening when I

09:15.354 --> 09:33.980
was seven years old. So, I started pretty young. By 
the time I was ten years old, I had the

09:36.346 --> 09:51.486
responsibility of from twenty-five to thirty 
black workers during the harvest all during the

09:36.346 --> 09:51.486
summer from the time school was out in May until we 
started back to school in September. I began

09:52.147 --> 09:57.253
responsibilities for supervising and managing 
those. My father turned that over to me. at ten, at

10:00.292 --> 10:01.974
age ten. So he gave you quite a bit of 
responsibility as a young man. Yes, and he taught

10:05.798 --> 10:09.843
me a lot about how to deal with people. He said you 
have to learn to treat them all alike, and I

10:12.066 --> 10:28.645
remember one of the first questions I asked him 
about that was, I said, well, Dad, I've learned

10:12.066 --> 10:28.645
here this year that these people are all 
different. Now, how can you treat them all alike?

10:33.082 --> 10:34.324
Different in what way did you mean? Well, I said 
they think differently. They don't look the same.

10:39.271 --> 10:40.493
They act differently. One will try to cheat you 
weighing cotton, and one is so honest that he may be

10:40.733 --> 10:50.147
the other way around. I said some of them are 
strong, some of them are weak, some of them eat more

10:50.287 --> 10:56.837
than the others. Some of them are... are smarter 
than the others. I said, they're all different,

11:00.649 --> 11:04.292
and you want me to treat them all alike? He said, I 
want you to treat them all alike from the

11:05.213 --> 11:11.018
standpoint of fairness and justice.

11:14.001 --> 11:21.749
And so that bothered me for about 25 years. Treat 
them all alike when they're all different.

11:31.096 --> 11:42.833
And that, at age 10, is when I started my study of 
people, because here was a wagon or a tractor. The

11:44.075 --> 11:50.624
personality of that tractor, of all the three or 
four tractors we had out there, was all the same.

11:53.969 --> 11:57.053
But the personality of those people out there were 
all different. And

11:59.733 --> 12:15.832
this is where I think you have to understand that 
this had a real impact on me back in those days. And I

12:16.253 --> 12:23.562
go back and think about it for the simple reason 
that I knew nothing about it. I didn't even know

12:23.582 --> 12:25.784
what the word leadership meant. Back in those 
days, we knew The term is a foreman, or a foreman for

12:30.479 --> 12:36.725
this, not the other. Foreman. So, ten years old, my 
father entrusted me as a foreman to move these

12:37.286 --> 12:45.634
people.

12:51.560 --> 12:58.647
When I was ten years old, I took a wagon, two mules, 
bedding roll,

13:02.255 --> 13:03.997
I spent the night on Red River. Next day I got into 
Ardmore and helped move these transits down to

13:05.379 --> 13:20.681
work all summer.

13:23.105 --> 13:30.996
In the fall, my father would take them back because 
I would be in school at that time. How'd you get

13:31.145 --> 13:33.307
along with the black people? I got along with them 
very well. I learned from one old gentleman named

13:36.350 --> 13:46.760
Jim Sutton, S-U-T-T-O-N, who was an old timer that 
lived with us. He and his wife, Virge, lived on our

13:47.340 --> 13:52.145
place all the time, constantly. There were 
permanent pictures there. I learned a lot from him

13:56.409 --> 14:01.033
about black people. You do learn a lot with them if 
you eat breakfast with them, or they eat with you at

14:01.807 --> 14:17.828
the house, and they're working with you all day and 
all night.

14:18.209 --> 14:23.155
You learn a lot about them, about association, and 
you. You got that, and you know they're, They're

14:28.182 --> 14:29.584
just like we are. They eat, they sleep, they work, 
wear the same kind of clothes. They've got a heart,

14:36.717 --> 14:39.662
a mind, and a soul. And I learned then that there's 
no difference between them and us. Well, with your

14:46.234 --> 14:50.882
experience as a young man with the blacks and later 
on when there was a civil rights movement in this

14:51.335 --> 14:55.360
country. Did you support that or were you 
basically against it or what were your feelings

14:55.881 --> 15:02.229
toward that based on your early years? I felt that 
we, the whites, that we the blacks had suffered a

15:02.770 --> 15:11.482
hundred years of injustice. That's the way I felt.

15:16.809 --> 15:18.591
A hundred years of injustice.

15:22.402 --> 15:24.084
And I feel that way today.

15:27.828 --> 15:39.662
Now, some of the catch-up things that we've done, I 
don't necessarily approve of, but I can

15:27.828 --> 15:39.662
understand them happening. Some of the specific 
programs, you think, weren't very wise. Weren't

15:44.368 --> 15:46.110
very wise at all. As a matter of fact, I think you've 
jeopardized and made many of the blacks are

15:53.333 --> 15:58.078
shameful of what's happening, and I think this is 
very bad. In general, then, you support it? Oh, 100

16:04.345 --> 16:08.009
percent, absolutely, absolutely. And I feel the 
same way about the other minorities, the

16:08.029 --> 16:16.078
Mexican-Americans, the same way. I think that

16:25.717 --> 16:30.984
that we oftentimes go overboard in trying to play a 
game of catch-up. In other words, if somebody

16:31.085 --> 16:40.317
wants to be a millionaire, you don't do that 
overnight.

16:44.563 --> 16:54.998
But I support fairness and justice for all, and the 
color of your skin in my view, has nothing to do with

16:56.513 --> 17:00.519
what's in your heart, mind, and soul. Okay. I'll 
let you continue with your mother. You started in

17:04.846 --> 17:08.372
telling me a little bit about your mother, but you 
never described her. You never told me about her

17:08.392 --> 17:10.034
character. My mother was a—if

17:12.278 --> 17:23.615
you could describe my mother and if she had had the 
opportunity, she would have probably been one of

17:12.278 --> 17:23.615
the greatest pianists in this country. Really? 
Yes. And she had a

17:25.943 --> 17:43.483
wonderful voice, not unlike her other brothers 
and sisters who had wonderful voices. They were a

17:43.503 --> 17:49.029
church singing type. I've never heard my mother 
sing many songs other than those which or were of

17:56.217 --> 17:58.560
religious nature. She attempted to teach myself 
and my three younger brothers to play the piano.

18:11.174 --> 18:25.650
And because of interest outside the

18:11.174 --> 18:25.650
house, somewhere on the farm or the ranch,

18:28.280 --> 18:35.992
This indoor sports and activities weren't to our 
liking, other than reading. I did a tremendous

18:37.094 --> 18:42.503
amount of reading about kerosene light and then 
the gas light. What kind of books did you usually

18:44.186 --> 18:45.748
read? I read history books. I read all the 
magazines on current affairs that we could get. We

18:55.230 --> 19:00.296
had an old magazine, I don't believe it's around 
anymore, Literary Digest.

19:04.281 --> 19:13.272
Got Saturday Evening Post, those types of things 
that I think we must have subscribed to. generally

19:15.395 --> 19:20.723
speaking, most all the major magazines at that 
time. You mentioned singing in church. Was your

19:23.347 --> 19:24.629
family religious? Yes, very religious, 
particularly my mother. What church did you go to?

19:33.081 --> 19:44.558
She was a Baptist, and

19:33.081 --> 19:44.558
I make no bones about the fact that

19:48.689 --> 19:50.511
I joined that church. It was in the schoolhouse, 
but I found good reason to get rid of that

19:50.611 --> 20:03.103
as soon as I could. It was very distasteful for me, 
even at age eight, nine, or ten, to know that on

20:03.583 --> 20:17.717
Saturday night my father and I had bottled up some 
home brew and put it in the cellar and

20:18.338 --> 20:43.536
be in church the next day and the preacher tell me 
that anybody that drank beer or anybody that

20:18.338 --> 20:43.536
smoked or anything like that was going to go to hell 
when I knew damn well at that age that wasn't the

20:18.338 --> 20:43.536
case so that was very distasteful to me and I 
thought well given an opportunity, I'm going to

20:45.743 --> 20:49.967
have to listen to this the rest of my life. And I 
didn't. When I was at West Point as an instructor,

20:51.729 --> 21:10.789
Ms. Hollingsworth and our son, we

20:51.729 --> 21:10.789
joined the Episcopalian, either Episcopalian or 
Lutheran, so we joined the Episcopalian Church in

20:51.729 --> 21:10.789
England, which we were very fond of and still 
active in. But, uh— Was your father religious? My

21:13.790 --> 21:32.562
father belonged to the Baptist Church, and if he 
wasn't working on Sunday or there wasn't

21:13.790 --> 21:32.562
something, it was just... You see out on the farm 
and ranch, that's seven days, 24 hours a day, and

21:13.790 --> 21:32.562
you don't go anywhere. Maybe you'd go away for a 
couple of hours on Sunday afternoon. You had to get

21:40.486 --> 21:44.110
back because you had cattle to feed in the evening. 
Maybe we'd all get in the, I never will forget, the

21:44.150 --> 22:07.057
first car that I remember having was a big 
four-door Oldsmobile touring car, you know, with

21:44.150 --> 22:07.057
a big top on it, four-door, with

21:44.150 --> 22:07.057
side curtains and a cloth top. I never will forget 
looking out at the breakfast room over the kitchen

22:11.401 --> 22:16.890
sink one day and a goat had gotten up on the car and 
fell through the top. Had his legs hanging down

22:17.451 --> 22:20.616
through there. But it was a funny looking thing. 
Unfortunately, the goat belonged to me and my

22:24.443 --> 22:29.892
mother took a damn view of it. But anyway, there was 
just no time. So sometimes

22:38.418 --> 22:41.141
The seven-day Adventist worked on Sunday. 
There's a number of German farmers and ranchers in

22:41.782 --> 22:47.848
our area, and they worked on Sunday. And 
oftentimes, my father had something he had to do on

22:47.908 --> 23:06.028
Sunday, but he believed in the year after and went 
to church as much as possible, but not like my

22:47.908 --> 23:06.028
mother because she was participating in— in the

23:06.953 --> 23:15.982
choir and also playing the piano, so she had to be 
there. Was your father ever a leader in the

23:16.143 --> 23:18.305
community? Not to my knowledge, no. No.

23:25.653 --> 23:30.097
He voted in all elections. He spent his whole life 
working out there on that farm. What political

23:36.080 --> 23:37.081
party? Was he a member of a political party? 
Democrats. He was a Democrat. Well, would you

23:40.446 --> 23:44.371
consider him a liberal, moderate, or 
conservative? He was the most conservative that

23:45.292 --> 23:48.055
you've ever seen. He really was. And what would 
you—did some of his political views wipe off on

23:50.699 --> 23:54.363
you? Yeah, and I changed the brand from Democrat to 
Republican.

24:02.674 --> 24:03.555
When did you do that? As soon as I could, when it 
become that. After you moved away from home? After

24:11.816 --> 24:13.458
I moved away from home, yeah. Probably after you 
left Texas? After I left Texas in the military. Who

24:19.406 --> 24:20.848
is the authority in the household? My father.

24:26.195 --> 24:27.877
You become a three-star general. In what way do 
you, what values do you contribute to your parents

24:27.917 --> 24:34.065
for your success? The early placing of 
responsibility

24:35.260 --> 24:55.609
and my willingness to accept the responsibility 
and meet my father's standards of discipline and

24:35.260 --> 24:55.609
doing everything right.

24:59.916 --> 25:04.322
And at the same time,

25:04.943 --> 25:30.345
going above and beyond what you learned in the 
school

25:04.943 --> 25:30.345
and knowing enough and beginning to learn enough 
about things other than what you see each day and

25:04.943 --> 25:30.345
what you learn in school each day. But I think they 
the

25:35.656 --> 26:04.903
trust

25:35.656 --> 26:04.903
and the early placing of responsibility and 
accepting responsibility, I learned that

25:35.656 --> 26:04.903
in order to get the job done out there and to work 
with the men that my father had entrusted to me,

26:05.491 --> 26:34.587
some of them were women, that

26:05.491 --> 26:34.587
I didn't know what I was doing, but I knew that, 
yeah, I would like to take off and go fishing, or I'd

26:05.491 --> 26:34.587
like to go over here and lay down while they're out 
doing something else and sleep for 30 minutes

26:05.491 --> 26:34.587
before they come back, or I'd like to go to the house 
and get some ice water instead of drinking this

26:35.765 --> 26:44.640
warm water out of this jug here that's got a cloth 
sack around it to try to keep it going. And I could

26:46.643 --> 26:52.313
have done that,

26:46.643 --> 26:52.313
but I didn't do that. I

26:52.333 --> 27:01.148
decided that I'd drink the same water that they're 
drinking and out of the same jug.

27:06.005 --> 27:19.862
As

27:06.005 --> 27:19.862
I look back on that,

27:06.005 --> 27:19.862
I found out what I was doing. I didn't know at the 
time. But I was divesting myself of selfish

27:23.066 --> 27:27.212
interests.

27:30.616 --> 27:35.522
In order to deal with people fairly and squarely 
and justly,

27:39.265 --> 27:44.033
You can't ask them to do something that you won't do 
yourself. You can't ask them to drink that warm

27:45.094 --> 27:56.092
water out of that jug there, and you go to the house 
and drink some cold water with some ice in it.

27:57.054 --> 27:58.997
You've got to drink the same thing. So what I'm 
saying is, I guess, that don't ever ask people to do

27:59.017 --> 28:06.589
it. do something that you're not willing to do 
yourself and if need be prove that then you'll

28:08.105 --> 28:36.525
begin to lead people to do things

28:08.105 --> 28:36.525
and so uh if you want to get involved with people you 
gotta divest yourself of selfish interest and I

28:08.105 --> 28:36.525
guess uh over the years of my life,

28:36.657 --> 28:51.236
that's the thing that I see as a fault amongst most 
of our people.

28:51.256 --> 28:52.958
I think we're all- Just Americans. Right, 
Americans. Okay, you're talking about Americans

28:55.141 --> 28:56.924
in general. I'm talking about Americans in 
general. Okay, good. Yes, Americans in general.

29:02.965 --> 29:21.201
failure to divest themselves of their own 
personal selfish interests which I in my study of

29:02.965 --> 29:21.201
people I believe is an inherent inborn 
characteristic of selfishness. One I do also know

29:23.003 --> 29:29.008
is inherent in our American people and that's 
adventurism. They're born with adventure. You

29:31.611 --> 29:32.972
can see that in the in a six-month-old

29:33.712 --> 29:38.657
and study of people. You can see a six-month-old 
begin to crawl. Why does he do that? He's looking

29:45.064 --> 29:46.325
for something. He wants to do something. He's 
looking for something. And you can watch him pull

29:50.970 --> 29:55.395
up on the coffee table. That's adventure. That's 
challenge.

30:00.500 --> 30:02.402
Adventure, challenge, and selfishness, I truly 
believe in a healthy youth of America is an inborn

30:02.618 --> 30:14.734
inherited characteristic. And I think you can see 
that displayed in the six months old and on up. And

30:23.165 --> 30:32.237
he pulls up on the

30:23.165 --> 30:32.237
coffee table and what attracts him most the 
brightest, the most uncommon thing that he's seen

30:32.943 --> 30:38.612
around the place. It might be a red glass ball or 
whatever it is. Venture or whatever it is. So, I've

30:48.066 --> 30:54.816
watched this thing for a long, long time. Let's 
talk about your education. What were your

30:59.411 --> 31:00.593
favorite subjects? You mentioned before history 
books and literature. Did you like that the most? I

31:05.579 --> 31:06.781
liked chemistry. Chemistry. I liked chemistry. I 
liked the hands-on things. I was a very poor

31:12.929 --> 31:18.336
student, a very good student, I think, in high 
school. The most attractive thing to me was-

31:24.850 --> 31:31.399
learning to do Future Farmer of America projects. 
As a matter of fact, I won several awards down at

31:31.679 --> 31:53.389
Texas A&M as a high school student in

31:31.679 --> 31:53.389
future farmer projects that you have, soldering 
and welding and cement mixing and sawing and all

31:31.679 --> 31:53.389
that sort of vocational sort of thing. I liked 
that. So I inclined toward that sort of thing,

31:57.555 --> 32:01.881
engineering. And so you were a member of the Future 
Farmers of America. Oh, yes. Did you have any roles

32:07.168 --> 32:09.952
of leadership when you were? Oh, yes. So you 
started your career as a leader quite young. Yes,

32:14.418 --> 32:15.579
exactly right. And where was that? I was in Sanger, 
Texas after I had left the Eighth grade, as I say, I

32:25.060 --> 32:32.911
lived seven miles away from a community called 
Sanger. That was the post office. That was the high

32:34.574 --> 32:36.697
school area. That was where you bought all your 
food and that sort of stuff. And I made that seven

32:42.645 --> 32:51.017
miles every day either by horseback or walked. 
Remember, that's 14 miles a day.

32:57.828 --> 33:17.388
Now, to play football, in addition, and you get 
through football practice at 5 o'clock, and you

32:57.828 --> 33:17.388
get home and then you drop your books and you go to 
work feeding cattle and so on and so forth, so you

32:57.828 --> 33:17.388
finish that off at 9 o'clock when you study. You 
don't. So you've got to be awful observant. in the

33:22.570 --> 33:24.553
class if you want to get by. So I did very well.

33:29.661 --> 33:36.713
I had a few problems in English because that was 
kind of a foreign thing to my interest. And I

33:38.456 --> 33:40.118
followed through at A&M. You said though that you 
were a leader in the Future Farmers. Yes. And what

33:46.268 --> 33:49.894
positions did you have? I started out as secretary 
of the Future Farmers my first year, I think, in the

33:50.954 --> 33:56.682
ninth grade. In the tenth grade, I was a vice 
president, and I was president of the Future

33:56.702 --> 34:04.714
Farmers chapter there in Sanger. I was 
responsible for help organizing these little

34:05.916 --> 34:14.608
fellas and selecting along with Professor 
Samuel, Professor Eli Samuel. He's dead now, but

34:14.668 --> 34:17.232
he's a magnificent man. And he was the sort of fella 
that'd give me responsibilities.

34:24.122 --> 34:43.063
He allowed me to take his car, for example, and take 
five or six of the key Future Farmers of America

34:24.122 --> 34:43.063
from Sanger, all of which is 50 miles north of here, 
all the way down to Texas A&M, meet him down there.

34:43.103 --> 34:44.965
He'd drive somebody else's car. He'd give me that 
responsibility. He was a professor at A&M. He was a

34:49.869 --> 34:52.292
later professor at A&M. He was a professor there 
and the superintendent of the school, a singer. So

34:58.619 --> 35:03.224
he was an influential fellow in my life. And

35:03.244 --> 35:14.877
it's that sort of thing that brought this on. Did 
you consider yourself popular in high school?

35:17.542 --> 35:20.065
Were you popular with the other students? Yes, I 
think so. I don't know of any enemies I had.

35:26.853 --> 35:31.479
Sometimes you have some, you don't know it, you 
know, but most of the time you know who they are. But

35:33.101 --> 35:35.043
as far as I know, I had none. When you graduated from 
high school, did you have firm aims about what you

35:35.064 --> 35:39.309
wanted to do? I mean, had you made up your mind, I 
want to go to A&M or? Did you think maybe military

35:42.515 --> 35:48.583
academy or just what did you think when you 
graduated? Well, my dad wanted me to be a doctor of

35:49.965 --> 35:53.029
veterinary medicine.

35:57.334 --> 36:00.759
And we had no money for me to go to school on. Zero. We 
never lacked for food or clothing or anything like

36:03.282 --> 36:06.506
that.

36:09.270 --> 36:11.593
And didn't have any debts. But when you make a 
bumper crop of oats or wheat and you

36:12.940 --> 36:37.486
sell it at the end of the year at the harvest time and 
it just barely pays the fuel bill and doesn't even

36:12.940 --> 36:37.486
pay you for your labor and so on and so forth, how can 
you send a guy that takes his A&M even if it's only

36:12.940 --> 36:37.486
for $5 a year? How do you do it? Well, I'll tell you 
how you do it. Mr. Samuel, Professor Samuel is

36:43.788 --> 36:55.160
interested enough in your capabilities and what 
he sees in you that he assists you in getting a job. I

36:57.762 --> 37:11.196
went to North Texas Agricultural College out here 
for one year and got off a few credits, but I worked

36:57.762 --> 37:11.196
the whole time I was there. Then I wanted to go to 
A&M. So this was kind of a prep school up here. I

37:19.308 --> 37:21.170
worked most of the time. And then Mr. Samuels 
helped me get a job at Texas A&M in the creamery down

37:21.270 --> 37:34.128
there across the tracks. And I had done real well in 
freshman chemistry. like that sort of stuff. And

37:44.481 --> 37:48.928
first thing you knew, I became the lab technician 
there. Well, what does that encompass? That

37:53.234 --> 38:09.637
encompass getting up at four o'clock in the 
morning

37:53.234 --> 38:09.637
and start sampling milk coming into that plant 
down there from all over Brazos County and so

37:53.234 --> 38:09.637
forth. Sampling that milk and then going and 
running the chemical analysis tests on it and then

38:12.517 --> 38:42.456
getting that out promptly and giving it to the 
farmer who's standing by as to what his bacterial

38:12.517 --> 38:42.456
count was or whatever the fat content was usually 
the fat content I run the bacterial count a little

38:12.517 --> 38:42.456
later because you know you had to cultivate that a 
little bit and uh but he has to know what what the

38:42.723 --> 39:11.413
butterfat content is because that's what you're 
going to pay him per hundred weight on and I had to do

38:42.723 --> 39:11.413
that while he was while his truck was waiting and 
get that on a piece of paper and our and they finally

38:42.723 --> 39:11.413
all got in about uh uh 7 45 then I had to run take a 
shower and made an 8 10 class

38:42.723 --> 39:11.413
and then in the afternoon uh It was four o'clock

39:11.748 --> 39:18.178
after school. We finished up about 830. That's how 
much I had to work in order to stay down there. I

39:29.577 --> 39:33.162
think we got 20 cents an hour or something. I'm not 
sure what it was.

39:38.714 --> 39:41.257
So you usually put in about eight hours a day. I 
worked eight hours a day and tried to take 16

39:41.277 --> 40:07.303
credits and I'd bust the hell out of English and do 
well on the other subjects and when I finished off

39:41.277 --> 40:07.303
down there I lacked one or two grade points of being 
able to go up and get my diploma and so they deferred

39:41.277 --> 40:07.303
my my diploma for one year because I was short a 
couple of grade points, but that didn't bother me a

40:08.718 --> 40:19.192
damn bit. They couldn't treat me harshly because 
I'd learned a hell of a lot. It was a great hardship,

40:27.903 --> 40:37.375
and I'd learned the preciseness that my father had 
taught me was not in the subjects and the manner in

40:38.384 --> 40:50.680
which the professors had puttin' it across, but 
was in the hardships that I'd suffered in order to

40:38.384 --> 40:50.680
stay in down there, and the military. Did they send 
you your diploma the next year, then? Yes. Yes.

40:57.148 --> 41:00.072
They sent me my diploma the next year. That's all 
right. I don't mind that. No. Hellfire. Did you

41:03.957 --> 41:07.902
ever think about going or applying for West Point? 
I

41:08.658 --> 41:35.425
guess that that was so far away, and for a farm guy to 
do that, that was just beyond my capabilities at

41:08.658 --> 41:35.425
that time to even apply.

41:42.998 --> 41:51.530
I was happy, though, when West Point selected me as 
the first non-West Point graduate to go back there

41:42.998 --> 41:51.530
as an instructor.

41:54.875 --> 42:02.705
Did the fact that we had a Corps of Cadets have 
anything to do with your deciding to go to A&M? Yes,

42:02.725 --> 42:03.366
it did. Will you explain?

42:08.674 --> 42:10.997
I was here at— NTHC, they had North Texas 
Agricultural College.

42:19.550 --> 42:23.116
You could either join the ROTC or not.

42:26.621 --> 42:41.001
And I watched,

42:26.621 --> 42:41.001
I watched

42:26.621 --> 42:41.001
for about a week these fellows all in the same 
uniform and They were doing things together, and

42:42.432 --> 42:53.026
they had a leader out there, and they had junior 
leaders.

42:55.990 --> 43:11.832
I said to myself,

42:55.990 --> 43:11.832
that's the sort of thing that would really be nice 
if I could progress up to be a leader of those guys

42:55.990 --> 43:11.832
there.

43:15.929 --> 43:26.698
I haven't seen anything else around here that's 
demanding from the standpoint of somebody being

43:15.929 --> 43:26.698
in charge and people reacting.

43:30.301 --> 43:45.514
And I knew they had a big corps of cadets at Texas 
A&M, and I thought the bigger the cadet corps, the

43:30.301 --> 43:45.514
better chance you've got of progressing up to some 
leadership.

43:48.346 --> 43:51.611
And I think that's what inspired me more to go to 
A&M. So it was a combination of the military and the

43:51.671 --> 43:55.898
desire to be a veterinarian? Yes, and my father was 
pushing me on the veterinarian business, but when

43:56.920 --> 44:16.210
I got out of A&M, I looked at this business of five 
years and studying, and there was just no way that I

43:56.920 --> 44:16.210
could stay in school down there and work, and

44:17.000 --> 44:27.976
ever become a doctor of veterinary medicine. I 
mean, the requirements are very demanding,

44:29.037 --> 44:41.455
and you've got to be able to put forth time to study. 
And, hell, when did I study?

44:52.623 --> 44:56.348
When do you study if you're working seven or eight 
hours a day?

44:59.311 --> 45:00.172
When do you do that? Let me tell you what you've got 
to do. You've got to somehow or another,

45:04.017 --> 45:11.526
regardless of how little sleep and how tired you 
are, you've got to stay awake. in class and listen

45:12.046 --> 45:23.384
and make notes on everything and be able to read the 
notes after you make them.

45:23.404 --> 45:24.426
That's what you've got to do.

45:27.351 --> 45:34.442
And you've got to have a book and you've got to, when 
somebody else wants to go out and play some

45:27.351 --> 45:34.442
softball or something, Whenever it is you've got 
some free time, you've got to thumb through those

45:35.249 --> 45:46.992
books and inspect these things and pick out what 
you think is important. And sometimes you miss.
