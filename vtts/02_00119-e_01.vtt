00:03.457 --> 00:13.446
That going to the chancellor's office would 
require hour upon hour of work and going far beyond

00:03.457 --> 00:13.446
the eight to five format. And I felt that Peggy, 
with one of her sons becoming a senior in high

00:15.488 --> 00:29.802
school that year, would have difficulty

00:15.488 --> 00:29.802
in keeping the clock calendar that would be 
essential in the chancellor's office.

00:38.202 --> 00:44.533
Also, Peggy had been with the College of Education 
since its beginning. and was in fact the thread

00:45.678 --> 01:03.945
that runs so true through much of the college's 
activities and would help the new dean, whoever he

00:45.678 --> 01:03.945
or she might be, in a fashion that would be 
essential.

01:09.754 --> 01:15.482
In the president's, in the chancellor's office 
when I arrived,

01:17.892 --> 01:37.003
There was an elder Raoul, an assistant to the 
chancellor,

01:17.892 --> 01:37.003
who again was a veteran on the campus and knew the 
history of the campus and all of its political

01:17.892 --> 01:37.003
machinations very, very well. She was a big help. A 
Shirley Lightfoot was a secretary, and her

01:40.673 --> 01:53.465
secretarial skills were just

01:40.673 --> 01:53.465
unmatched. I don't know of anyone who could do 
correspondence as rapidly and as accurately as

01:54.266 --> 02:04.435
she kept it. There was another young lady.

02:09.901 --> 02:17.514
a graduate of

02:09.901 --> 02:17.514
St. Edward's in Austin.

02:21.260 --> 02:29.935
I think she's now with the vice president or vice 
chancellor for agriculture, Patricia Gehring.

02:31.180 --> 02:35.546
Again, a very talented young woman. That was in the 
immediate office staff. Surrounding me, other

02:38.390 --> 02:56.316
than Bob Cherry and Clyde Freeman and Peel, was 
also on the chancellor's staff, James Bond, the

02:38.390 --> 02:56.316
attorney for the system. James had the advantage 
of knowing the of knowing the area of education

03:01.673 --> 03:07.080
quite well. He had had actually more experience 
before coming on board as attorney for the system.

03:15.550 --> 03:21.277
He had had more experience in public education 
than he had in higher education. To my knowledge, I

03:21.317 --> 03:27.524
know that he had been a member of the Board of 
Trustees of the Navasota School District. And Jim

03:27.544 --> 03:31.309
was a big help. I look upon Jim as sort of a student of 
Clyde Freeman's. Clyde Freeman taught James

03:38.315 --> 03:55.238
an immense amount of background information 
regarding the Attorney General's office,

03:38.315 --> 03:55.238
opinions of the Attorney General.

03:57.395 --> 04:06.187
budget procedures, the permanent and available 
university funds, and James was a good student. He

04:06.207 --> 04:07.189
learned them well. They were the main ones. Some of 
your student products in whom you take great

04:11.535 --> 04:20.027
pride, like Brian Cole and others. Yes, yes. My 
number one

04:27.736 --> 04:37.329
choice for a student who who succeeded admirably 
was a chap by the name of Jack Humphreys. Jack came

04:39.372 --> 04:47.323
to me as an assistant registrar at Sam Houston 
State University. I had a call from the president

04:48.745 --> 04:52.630
of that institution saying Frank Have a young man 
over here, assistant registrar. He has a master's

04:58.338 --> 05:00.921
degree in history from Baylor. Really an 
outstanding scholar and student. He's far above

05:04.445 --> 05:07.229
being an assistant registrar. He needs to get his 
doctorate degree and do things other than what

05:07.629 --> 05:13.076
he's doing now. Can you help him? I said, have him 
come over and visit with me. He did. Tremendously

05:18.463 --> 05:21.647
impressive chap. Articulate, poised.

05:26.005 --> 05:38.310
knowledgeable, highly intelligent, excellent

05:26.005 --> 05:38.310
vocabulary,

05:26.005 --> 05:38.310
wrote well.

05:40.889 --> 05:45.437
I asked him to immediately to be a graduate 
assistant in my office. He accepted, later on

05:46.679 --> 06:02.508
became assistant dean, and then associate dean, 
and by the time he finished his PhD degree, he was

05:46.679 --> 06:02.508
truly a remarkable person. I think Jack, had not 
only my high praise, but he was highly respected by

06:06.151 --> 06:25.459
the heads of departments in the college, both of 
liberal arts

06:06.151 --> 06:25.459
and of education.

06:31.160 --> 06:47.382
Jack was astute, tactful, diplomatic in his 
relationships with the administrators in the

06:31.160 --> 06:47.382
colleges and was a tremendously big help. Went 
back to Sam Houston as dean of their liberal arts

06:49.505 --> 06:54.973
section. Stayed a couple of three years there, 
then was chosen by Southern Ross State University

06:55.696 --> 07:02.143
as president. Operated very effectively in that 
office. Revived that institution giving program

07:08.190 --> 07:20.885
by rejuvenating its development foundation and 
was very successful there. Sadly enough, Jack had

07:21.826 --> 07:25.450
cancer. And after a year's stay in Houston on leave 
from Sol Ross, he and his wife and family moved to

07:26.915 --> 07:37.029
Houston with him. He had a wife and two sons. Jack 
died of the cancer. Sad, sad, sad young man.

07:48.384 --> 07:56.635
Another choice of mine was another lad who made 
college presidency, and this was David Johnson, a

07:48.384 --> 07:56.635
Negro from Tyler, who became president of Texas 
College in Tyler, a Methodist-related church,

07:57.678 --> 08:10.073
school, small liberal arts college, struggling 
for survival. David did well, and strangely

08:10.694 --> 08:21.087
enough, too, during

08:10.694 --> 08:21.087
his

08:10.694 --> 08:21.087
term as president, He was identified as a cancer 
patient and died of that disease. So that was sad.

08:29.248 --> 08:34.174
Another one whom I would point to with great pride 
is Linda Whitson. Linda was an outstanding woman

08:35.616 --> 08:42.864
student in the graduate program. Thorough, 
statistically

08:44.766 --> 08:50.753
very sharp, an attractive lady, quite handsome in 
fact, always so well-groomed, articulate, but

08:51.593 --> 09:02.707
quiet. There wasn't an aggressive

09:03.328 --> 09:15.863
inclination, I think, in her makeup, but so 
thorough in the things that she did. After she

09:16.653 --> 09:25.265
received her doctorate, I received a call from the 
president of the University of Texas at San

09:16.653 --> 09:25.265
Antonio asking me about her. She had applied for a 
job over there and was accepted for it and became

09:26.286 --> 09:44.230
vice president at the University of Texas San 
Antonio for

09:26.286 --> 09:44.230
business matters, I think.

09:51.635 --> 09:58.047
Well, a phase of business, personnel matters and 
things of that nature. I don't think she was the

09:58.848 --> 10:14.217
dollar number cruncher, but the area of personnel

09:58.848 --> 10:14.217
relations, she was there and, as I understand, had 
an outstanding record. I would mention those

10:14.618 --> 10:22.789
three as outstanding, along with Brian Cole, who 
also was an associate dean. When he finished with

10:24.111 --> 10:34.625
me, he was

10:24.111 --> 10:34.625
from Marlin, Texas.

10:37.630 --> 10:41.655
Brian came to A&M.

10:45.027 --> 10:48.871
It was he who followed Jack Humphries in the 
office. And Brian was a veteran of the Vietnamese

10:50.172 --> 10:58.240
operation. His undergraduate work had been done 
at the United States Military Academy on the

10:59.121 --> 11:05.828
Hudson, West Point. And just a very, very fine man. 
exceptionally well-trained

11:13.630 --> 11:19.997
individual.

11:23.701 --> 11:36.896
Brian was assistant and then a graduate 
assistant, then assistant dean, then an

11:23.701 --> 11:36.896
associate dean, and

11:23.701 --> 11:36.896
was simply outstanding in the work which he 
performed. Was the immediate past chancellor one

11:38.578 --> 11:43.283
of your doctoral students? Who? The immediate 
past chancellor. Oh, Barry Thompson? Barry. Was

11:51.133 --> 11:52.214
he one of your students? No. I have a connection 
with Barry, but it was not in a student

11:55.659 --> 11:59.464
relationship. These first four that I've 
mentioned, I chaired their doctoral committees.

12:08.635 --> 12:11.419
That's what I perceive you mean by a student. 
Right, right. Barry Thompson was, I knew him

12:12.659 --> 12:19.868
primarily as the son of his father. I knew his 
father quite well. Tommy Thompson,

12:22.111 --> 12:26.036
superintendent of schools at Kermit, Texas for 
many years. A legend among Texas school

12:27.257 --> 12:30.081
administrators. Truly outstanding guy. Barry 
had come up through the public education route.

12:37.169 --> 12:40.033
I'd met him along the way several times. and 
learned from him during a conversation when he

12:40.520 --> 12:54.259
came to campus that he wanted to complete his 
graduate work at A&M. and do a doctorate there with

12:54.779 --> 12:56.581
us. And he says, I've got to find, at that moment, he 
was assistant superintendent of schools for the

12:56.742 --> 13:11.641
Waco Independent School District in charge of 
their curricular matters, assistant

12:56.742 --> 13:11.641
superintendent for curriculum. And his salary, I 
expect, was a pretty good salary at that time. And

13:17.729 --> 13:23.436
he said, Dean Hubert, I simply My family, I would 
put my family to an unjustified position

13:23.872 --> 13:39.015
if I asked them to try to live on the salary of a 
graduate assistant. So if you have anything in the

13:39.035 --> 13:50.031
future that you see developing that you could help 
me in a job here at A&M, I'd appreciate it. Well, I

13:52.542 --> 14:18.718
knew of his high anxiety to finish the doctorate, 
and so there came a time when I was able to upgrade

13:52.542 --> 14:18.718
one of the graduate assistantships associated 
with my office to the point that Barry could live on

13:52.542 --> 14:18.718
it for a year

13:52.542 --> 14:18.718
with his family. And he did, and it was through that 
that he completed his residency at A&M. He already

14:24.590 --> 14:37.848
was a student, commuting student, but he had to 
have a year's residency, and it was my finding him

14:24.590 --> 14:37.848
that position that enabled him to complete that. 
So that was my basic association with him. I did not

14:44.888 --> 14:50.454
share his doctoral committee, nor was I a member of 
it. But that's the relationship. In your 30 years,

14:52.997 --> 15:08.854
more than 30 years of official relation with Texas 
A&M and the A&M system, which directors, and then

14:52.997 --> 15:08.854
their title was changed to regents, deserve the 
greatest credit?

15:12.597 --> 15:15.521
Total time at A&M High School, twenty-three 
years. Oh, my math wrong. Fifty-nine to

15:19.286 --> 15:20.407
eighty-two. That's right, my math wrong, yeah. 
Now,

15:22.510 --> 15:35.247
which regents or directors deserve the greatest 
credit? Well, starting with the directors group,

15:36.982 --> 15:49.835
one would first have to place Sterling Evans at the 
top of the list, without any doubt.

15:52.498 --> 16:06.972
Although Sterling, I think, had been through the 
agricultural degree program at A&M,

15:52.498 --> 16:06.972
nonetheless, he was far ahead of many of his 
colleagues on the board in support of a

16:08.487 --> 16:22.733
broad-based,

16:08.487 --> 16:22.733
well-balanced university.

16:24.232 --> 16:40.213
He was just as supportive of engineering, of the 
arts and sciences, and of veterinary medicine as

16:24.232 --> 16:40.213
any others, probably more so for the arts and 
sciences. He appreciated the essential

16:40.233 --> 16:51.167
necessity of

16:40.233 --> 16:51.167
communication skills, of history, and he was a 
great supporter of that realm.

17:06.279 --> 17:18.960
I would also name Dr. Boydle later on as a regent, 
who was an outstanding board member along with

17:06.279 --> 17:18.960
Gardner Simons. who at that time was chairman of 
the board of tech of Tentaco Corporation, and who

17:19.852 --> 17:41.286
incidentally, I think, had served on the Stanford

17:19.852 --> 17:41.286
California Board of Regents or Trustees, by 
whatever name.

17:42.515 --> 18:01.059
In his capacity as chief executive officer of a 
major corporation, he brought a new vision and

17:42.515 --> 18:01.059
foresight

17:42.515 --> 18:01.059
to the Board of Regents.

18:03.982 --> 18:07.947
Sam Wittenberg from Amarillo, Texas. I think a 
background in the newspaper field. Wittenberg

18:14.122 --> 18:19.889
was a University of Texas graduate.

18:19.909 --> 18:43.015
He was strongly interested in a strongly

18:19.909 --> 18:43.015
based university

18:19.909 --> 18:43.015
with power and

18:44.497 --> 18:55.433
excellence in the humanities and social sciences 
and mathematics and physical sciences as was

18:44.497 --> 18:55.433
anyone else.

18:59.779 --> 19:04.446
I would name those as outstanding ones which I 
remember. Later on, more in my years as

19:05.489 --> 19:14.937
chancellor, I would have to name John Blocker. As 
John Blocker was chief stockholder, chairman of

19:16.999 --> 19:31.412
the board, and president of Blocker Energy 
Corporation in Houston, it too was a major

19:16.999 --> 19:31.412
organization. John was outstanding on the board. 
as was Dr. John Coleman of Houston, a physician, a

19:35.662 --> 19:44.674
black individual. He was there, I presume, as a 
political representative of Prairie View A&M. I

19:54.727 --> 20:02.817
don't know that that's the truth, but he was 
interested in Prairie View but not to the

20:03.353 --> 20:06.577
disadvantage of any other institution. John was 
an outstanding board member. Al

20:13.065 --> 20:21.535
Davies of Fort Worth, no, of Dallas.

20:27.282 --> 20:29.665
Clyde Wells of Granbury. Clyde held the 
chairmanship of the board of,

20:31.298 --> 20:39.950
I guess, directors and regents for a good long 
while. Clyde was a manager of a large agricultural

20:39.990 --> 20:50.684
organization in Dallas. Actually, their 
agricultural interests were out more in the

20:51.225 --> 20:58.234
Granbury area where his residence was. He was good 
on the board and for the board. Quiet,

21:02.531 --> 21:10.202
but effective.

21:13.047 --> 21:17.233
Your proudest accomplishments in relationship 
to A&M?

21:25.586 --> 21:28.170
Haskell, it's hard to identify one. Well, it can be 
plural.

21:36.224 --> 21:46.114
Among those that I was pleased with the outcome of 
were these.

21:52.860 --> 21:57.364
In the first several years development of the 
College of Liberal Arts,

22:02.153 --> 22:05.839
Science had broken out because science wanted its 
own identity.

22:09.405 --> 22:28.836
Liberal arts, when it achieved its separate 
identity, seemed to move forward rapidly,

22:09.405 --> 22:28.836
both in scholarship of faculty, I think, as well as 
enrollment of students.

22:31.820 --> 22:42.213
Another accomplishment that I was proud of was my 
chairmanship of the Coordinating Committee of

22:31.820 --> 22:42.213
the Century Council. I think that enabled me to 
have some inputs into the deliberations of that

22:43.374 --> 22:57.372
organization which moved A&M forward.

23:03.882 --> 23:10.471
Another would be the origination of the honors 
program at A&M.

23:15.978 --> 23:24.289
After the big change took place, co-eds admitted, 
military no longer required. One day, Dick

23:24.330 --> 23:33.602
Ballinger, a professor of English, visited with 
me and said, Dean Hubert, there's been a little

23:24.330 --> 23:33.602
talk in the English department. about the 
desirability of starting an honors section in

23:34.325 --> 23:39.131
English. We're getting some outstanding 
students, and we'd like to take them a little

23:39.611 --> 23:49.102
faster and further than our ordinary curriculum 
would. How would you react to our establishing an

23:50.164 --> 23:54.749
honors program in English?" I said, Dick, it's a 
great idea. why don't we do it for the college and

23:58.169 --> 24:05.178
ask other departments if they'd like to join in 
establishing honors programs. He said, fine. I

24:06.380 --> 24:11.226
said, well, will you be the faculty sponsor of an 
honors program? And he said, yes. And that took off

24:13.469 --> 24:17.875
and was a success, I think.

24:22.281 --> 24:27.788
In the College of Education, I would point to the 
accreditation by the college and every one of its

24:28.257 --> 24:37.687
teacher education programs by the National 
Council for the Accreditation of Teacher

24:28.257 --> 24:37.687
Education. It's most unusual on a first visit by 
this evaluation team from NCATE for that

24:38.428 --> 24:50.822
institution to be approved in every one of its 
offerings. from baccalaureate through the

24:50.920 --> 24:54.924
doctorate, and A&M was. And I think that's a case of 
where I simply happened to be there when it took

24:55.724 --> 25:02.991
place. We had a great faculty, and they were the key 
elements in that accomplishment. But it's one

25:11.619 --> 25:15.062
that I am quite proud of. In the chancellor's 
office, Haskell, again, hard to say. I thought my

25:21.228 --> 25:30.327
proposal for the reorganization of the system was 
sound in

25:21.228 --> 25:30.327
my single-track way, I guess, of thinking of 
things. I still think it was a good thing for the

25:34.231 --> 25:55.217
system, although I

25:34.231 --> 25:55.217
think it would take

25:34.231 --> 25:55.217
the Green Berets in full force armor to make it 
feasible again, politically feasible. Those are

25:56.547 --> 26:02.414
some of the things along the way. What's your 
favorite Aggie story? Got to be some moment you

26:08.962 --> 26:12.146
remember that you loved. Yes.

26:16.332 --> 26:20.417
My favorite Aggie story is this one. It's used as an 
illustration.

26:28.441 --> 26:35.934
during what I call the golden years of A&M, just how 
dramatically that institution turned around.

26:37.236 --> 26:54.685
From being recognized by high school students 
somewhere out there as a, as a cow college, on

26:37.236 --> 26:54.685
through up to becoming a full-fledged major 
university. And it's a story that goes like this.

27:01.303 --> 27:03.947
Education at A&M has changed dramatically. In 
fact, over the past 20 or 25 years, it has come full

27:05.068 --> 27:12.417
circle, 180 degree change. For example, at A&M 25 
years ago, all the Aggies were telling moron

27:14.560 --> 27:23.031
jokes. And today,

27:28.685 --> 27:30.007
That's my favorite story. If you mean an Aggie joke 
story, that's my favorite one. What

27:38.417 --> 27:57.882
advice would you give to the leaders of A&M today 
about what the role, I'll use the phrase role and

27:38.417 --> 27:57.882
scope, what advice would you give the leaders of 
A&M today, be they board members or

27:58.233 --> 28:03.518
administrators, the role and scope of Texas A&M 
University, what should it be?

28:09.544 --> 28:16.872
I would suggest to them that first they should 
study carefully the history of the university.

28:17.913 --> 28:26.822
Look at it from day one and over the past 100 and 
what, 10, 15 years now, I'm not sure, 114 years.

28:32.994 --> 28:41.589
Find out what brought it from its beginnings to 
where it is today. Know something about the

28:43.533 --> 28:49.924
essence of a land-grant college and the fact that 
The original premise behind a land-grant college

28:51.659 --> 29:20.805
hasn't been abandoned, but the change in the 
nature of our nation

28:51.659 --> 29:20.805
has taken us to the point where a

28:51.659 --> 29:20.805
true college-university type institution must 
go far beyond the emphasis upon agriculture and

29:21.967 --> 29:25.092
the mechanical arts. That would be my first 
recommendation

29:27.075 --> 29:39.793
for

29:27.075 --> 29:39.793
leaders of the university.

29:42.738 --> 29:46.303
I would suggest next that

29:51.413 --> 30:04.518
That they seek good advice if they are not attuned 
to the

29:51.413 --> 30:04.518
various components of a top university.

30:06.903 --> 30:13.135
Seek good advice and know what questions to ask of 
whom. Knowing which question to ask and to whom to

30:14.448 --> 30:34.212
address that question is exceedingly important 
for administrators, governing board members,

30:14.448 --> 30:34.212
faculty members, and all of us. I think those would 
be my two major recommendations. Know the

30:40.302 --> 30:44.489
history, seek good advice, and know what 
questions to ask. Okay, one light question and

30:45.670 --> 30:50.017
then two serious questions and we're finished. 
The light question is did any students or anybody

30:50.037 --> 31:03.658
else ever try to play any jokes or pranks on you as a 
teacher, as an administrator?

31:06.558 --> 31:08.821
Not that I recall. Nobody in class tried to set one 
up or anything? No. Okay. All right. Next to last

31:15.150 --> 31:16.252
question. Looking back, what effect has it had on 
your life that you came to Texas A&M in 1959?

31:28.209 --> 31:31.333
Well, it's had a...

31:33.220 --> 31:43.371
It's had a very dominant role in

31:33.220 --> 31:43.371
my life after A&M. It

31:45.273 --> 31:56.166
has brought me to a recognition that this 
community is an important community. This

31:56.766 --> 32:02.873
university is an important university.

32:07.004 --> 32:08.773
must not take the short view. They

32:08.813 --> 32:14.382
need to look well into the future.
