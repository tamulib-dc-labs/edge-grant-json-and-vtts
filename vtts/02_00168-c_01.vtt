3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3. Try it again. 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.

00:14.671 --> 00:18.675
So you were ready to go back to graduate school? Is 
that? After two years, in the meantime, I'd gotten

00:19.796 --> 00:22.820
married. And that was part of my help in getting 
through my master's. I had no financial

00:29.026 --> 00:30.628
assistance. I'm a master's, but I thought the best 
thing to do was to do it as quickly as possible full

00:31.351 --> 00:38.260
time, then get back on the job. And we married in 
1950, and this was the following year in 51. We

00:47.773 --> 00:52.339
applied, or I would look very carefully at the 
University of Missouri. There were only two or

00:52.359 --> 01:00.109
three universities in the country that were 
offering an extension education program.

01:00.680 --> 01:06.385
Missouri was one of the first ones, and Michigan 
was, Michigan State was one of the others. And I

01:08.107 --> 01:18.117
guess I was leaning toward Missouri, but in the 
meantime, my job, my wife got a firm teaching job

01:08.107 --> 01:18.117
offer in East Lansing, Michigan, or close to East 
Lansing, Michigan. And so we took off for Michigan

01:18.137 --> 01:24.102
and did a master's there and finished in nine 
months. Came back to Matagorda County as county

01:25.203 --> 01:30.028
agent in June of that year. Describe the duties of 
Matagorda County agent. Well, let me back up and

01:35.247 --> 01:41.556
tell you one little anecdote about being in 
Michigan. I got very close to the people up there.

01:44.180 --> 01:50.689
In fact, my offices were right across the hall from 
their field supervisor staff. And of course, I got

01:50.729 --> 01:57.038
to know the professor, Dr. John Stone, who later 
was director of extension in South Dakota. And

01:58.220 --> 01:59.982
they from very early started talking about my 
staying in Michigan and working with them and I had

02:01.295 --> 02:28.365
no I was on leave from Texas A&M University but 
leave without pay and I had felt an obligation of

02:01.295 --> 02:28.365
coming back but I guess since they didn't offer me 
any financial assistance that I might have

02:01.295 --> 02:28.365
considered an offer but the anecdote was that one 
one of the supervisors called me in one day and I

02:29.071 --> 02:32.314
guess they weren't right sure they wanted a Texan 
just yet. Maybe they could try me out on an interim

02:33.796 --> 02:36.518
basis. But they had one of their larger counties up 
in the Thumb area, Genesee County, as I recall, up

02:36.558 --> 02:50.512
in the Thumb area of Michigan, had an agent that was 
going to do two years of international

02:36.558 --> 02:50.512
assignment. And they would employ me as an acting 
agent until he got back. And by then, they'd have a

02:55.037 --> 02:58.420
look at me, and I could have a look at them. I was, you 
know, I didn't reject because I didn't have a firm

02:59.243 --> 03:03.708
thing in Texas. The only thing they said, you know, 
we'll do the best we can when you come back. We don't

03:07.612 --> 03:11.576
know when the vacancies will be there because I was 
not on leave from a position. I was on leave from the

03:11.616 --> 03:12.957
organization. Anyway, this supervisor very 
solemnly asked me if I drank on the job. No, not if I

03:19.464 --> 03:20.966
drank on the job. He asked me if I drank. And I 
thought, boy, this is a very dangerous question.

03:27.512 --> 03:29.014
And I thought a little bit, and I said, no. Well, I 
have taken a drink now and then, but never, ever,

03:29.264 --> 03:34.072
ever on the job. And I don't think we could use you. 
And I said, why? And he said, well, there's a lot of

03:37.928 --> 03:44.758
German farmers up there, and when they have 
extension meetings, they serve beer in the middle

03:37.928 --> 03:44.758
of the day. If you don't partake, you're not

03:44.798 --> 03:50.246
going to feed it. So not thinking was a 
disadvantage. But I was very cautious in my

03:52.409 --> 03:54.913
answer. Never, ever on the job. I said, well, I 
probably can't use you. But anyway, we did have a

04:00.281 --> 04:05.869
farm offer to go to Matagorda County of Bay City. We 
grabbed it and went on down there. Matagorda

04:10.326 --> 04:12.708
County was, of course, right next to Wharton 
County. The agriculture was primarily rice, beef

04:13.749 --> 04:21.036
cattle, and cotton, some grain sorghum. It was a 
wonderful county to work in. It had one major

04:24.560 --> 04:27.123
county seat town. A lot of times, if county agents 
have a problem like we did in Wharton, you have two

04:27.143 --> 04:34.610
smaller towns like Wharton, the county seat, 
which is smaller than El Campo. And they're always

04:34.670 --> 04:36.632
at each other's throats. do one thing in one part, 
and you'd have to do the same thing in the other, and

04:36.916 --> 04:40.621
so forth. In Matagorda, of course, they had 
palaces, but palaces was much smaller. And it was a

04:44.566 --> 04:48.111
wonderful experience. They had one of the best 
churches there. A fellow named Donald was

04:51.396 --> 04:54.740
minister in the Presbyterian church there. And we 
participated very actively in the church there.

04:59.847 --> 05:03.913
And we had a very modest, but good life down there. 
People treated us very well. Now that was how far

05:05.637 --> 05:07.540
from where you'd grown up? Well, it was on the 
coast, Matagorda. No, and you grew up? I grew up in

05:11.166 --> 05:12.849
Bexar County, close to San Antonio. Oh, yeah, so, 
and the... As I said, I didn't know anything about

05:12.949 --> 05:17.697
rice when I came into that area. And the population 
make up, there were a good many Germans down there?

05:23.046 --> 05:25.510
No, down in Matagorda County, there were a lot of 
Czech people. A few Czech people, a few Germans,

05:25.731 --> 05:28.836
but more Czech. In fact, the western part of the 
county was heavily Czech. And it was also the

05:31.861 --> 05:36.566
headquarters of Shanghai Pierce, if you 
remember. He was a legend in that county. In the

05:39.089 --> 05:45.155
family, there was a big pro football player named 
Heffelfinger. You ever heard of him? Pudge

05:45.635 --> 05:46.596
Heffelfinger. He was from that area. I think he 
even had a little monument back there. But it was a

05:50.420 --> 05:51.562
nice place. Did anybody give you any advice when 
you first started out? Did anybody kind of pull you

05:55.546 --> 05:59.810
aside and try to tell you what to do or not to do? 
Well, you got a lot of that. from whom older agents

06:01.628 --> 06:30.370
okay experienced agents and others that were you 
know interested and you're getting off to a good

06:01.628 --> 06:30.370
start but i guess one of the first things they 
hammered into me i guess as a new county extension

06:01.628 --> 06:30.370
agent you feel that you have to know the answer to 
everything and i said you know learn very early

06:01.628 --> 06:30.370
that if you don't know say you don't know but you'll 
get the answer which we always could you know

06:01.628 --> 06:30.370
because we had specialists backing us up and often 
you can just pick up the telephone and get the

06:30.822 --> 06:35.407
information they needed, but it's hard for a young 
person right out of college to say, I don't know.

06:36.268 --> 06:38.150
What kind of staffing did you have? Well, we had in 
that county four agents.

06:44.377 --> 06:55.530
I had two agricultural agents, I had an assistant 
agent, and they had two women in home economics, an

06:44.377 --> 06:55.530
agent and an assistant agent, and they also had two 
black staff members. But they were, at that time,

06:55.882 --> 06:59.146
housed separately from where we were housed. But 
we worked together pretty closely. And as you

07:02.129 --> 07:07.315
started off, what did you see as your primary 
responsibilities? Well,

07:08.517 --> 07:24.015
I tended to see my role as more of helping the 
smaller farmers, because the rice farmers

07:08.517 --> 07:24.015
generally at that time were a very

07:25.919 --> 07:26.861
Very well off group. Those were in the 50s, and 
there was a good world market for rice, and they

07:27.081 --> 07:33.312
were big operators. I mean, they farm like 800,000 
acres and run cattle with it, and many of them had

07:33.372 --> 07:39.983
oil wells with it. And they didn't really need a lot 
of help. We served the rice industry very well by

07:42.548 --> 07:47.877
having once or twice a year what we called a rice 
day. get all the specialists from Beaumont and

07:48.565 --> 07:54.212
Texas A&M and had marketing discussed and all of 
that. And 90% of the rice farmers would attend, and

07:54.232 --> 07:58.797
that's about the main service. Occasionally 
you've got some calls for that, but most of the

07:58.817 --> 08:06.206
small farmers in the county were cotton farmers 
and some grain sorghum. And I spent an awful lot of

08:06.226 --> 08:11.152
time with them, organizing them, working with 
them. A lot of it had to do with insect control in

08:11.272 --> 08:14.556
cotton. Those were the days when the miracle 
chemicals were coming out of World War II and DDT

08:15.363 --> 08:26.959
and all of those things which are now discredited 
were very much in vogue. I guess I saw myself on the

08:27.119 --> 08:34.089
forefront of what happened in terms of the use of 
pesticides. The marketers of agricultural

08:35.611 --> 08:43.362
chemical companies were really marketing a lot of 
stuff very aggressively. And with a lot of

08:43.510 --> 08:49.640
farmers, it really was effective at first because 
the insects weren't resistant and all of that. And

08:50.441 --> 08:57.012
a lot of farmers thinking was that if a little bit is 
good, it would be a whole lot better. And it wasn't

08:57.032 --> 08:58.575
that expensive in those days. So they overused it a 
lot. And we really got into some problems that were

09:00.378 --> 09:04.084
early recognizable. There's no, as I've often 
stated when I was down there, there's no plant more

09:05.313 --> 09:11.218
attractive to insects than cotton. There are at 
least 22 to 25 identifiable insects that thrive in

09:11.578 --> 09:16.402
cotton. The boll weevil and the boll worm are the 
two main ones. But we began to recognize early that

09:22.788 --> 09:27.072
we're getting some problems in terms of control. 
In fact, at that time, Texas A&M was advocating

09:29.033 --> 09:33.257
what they called a preventive program. You did 
early season spraying with with not even looking.

09:36.707 --> 09:44.176
You just did it because then you'd get the plant off 
to a good start and so forth, but then you should

09:36.707 --> 09:44.176
stop and only treat later if needed. But what 
happened in the program was that as they were using

09:45.037 --> 09:56.730
these powerful hydrocarbon chemicals, when 
they'd fight the boll weevil, say in the month of

09:45.037 --> 09:56.730
June, they'd kill out everything. I mean, it was 
sterile. I mean, there were no beneficial

09:57.731 --> 09:59.273
insects. The boll worm, which is the same thing 
that gets into your fear of corn that you tip in,

10:04.038 --> 10:21.936
it's the same creature, they are very susceptible 
to lacewing flies and to ladybugs and all of that,

10:04.038 --> 10:21.936
because the female lays their eggs singly on top of 
them, and 99% get eaten. And you'll have some, but

10:22.076 --> 10:33.707
if you spray or dust, and in those days they used 
airplanes a lot too, you just kill out everything,

10:22.076 --> 10:33.707
and when these bull worms come in, And usually they 
came from the corn crop because it matured at that

10:34.008 --> 10:37.012
time. There was nothing there. And just 
overnight, you could just be devastated. So we

10:42.179 --> 10:47.627
recognized early on that beneficial insects 
played a big role in this. And we just called

10:47.707 --> 10:51.733
attention to that type of thing. And it's about 
then that the entomologists began to identify

10:51.793 --> 10:55.999
that that was indeed a problem. But I spent a lot of 
time trying to educate farmers on how identify

11:04.518 --> 11:33.377
their problems and as I often said I guess I talked 
more people out of using chemicals than using them

11:04.518 --> 11:33.377
because they always were ready to go you know they 
wanted to save their crop and one of the with the

11:04.518 --> 11:33.377
problem with the Gulf Coast was in in the 
summertime you almost have a shower every day you

11:04.518 --> 11:33.377
put out the chemicals get a little right rain and 
all wash off and then you were unprotected again

11:04.518 --> 11:33.377
you probably killed some good insects in the 
meantime so you were really vulnerable and so we

11:33.745 --> 11:38.752
began to learn that it was better in many, many 
cases not to use the pesticides. Probably the

11:39.273 --> 11:40.935
companies didn't like that. But I felt a very 
strong role to work with the smaller farmers.

11:45.722 --> 11:47.925
There were a lot of good family farms. We had 4-H 
programs that involved the children, which the

11:48.506 --> 11:53.714
assistant agent mostly worked with. It was a very 
satisfying experience. Was there any kind of

11:57.880 --> 11:59.963
advisor group? Yeah, we had a program building 
committee where we had to leaders from every

12:04.390 --> 12:12.519
community come together a couple of times a year 
and try to identify what they considered were the

12:04.390 --> 12:12.519
main problems of the county. And this would not 
just relate to agriculture, but even community

12:12.559 --> 12:16.043
problems. We helped organize communities. 
Reagan Brown in those days had a program of

12:19.006 --> 12:22.810
community organizations. And we'd encourage 
communities to organize. And they had monthly

12:25.573 --> 12:29.618
programs on various subjects. And it was a good 
contact, good meeting place.

12:35.069 --> 12:37.493
you know, a very satisfying operation. I guess I 
was there about three and a half years, and when I

12:38.134 --> 12:55.740
was invited to come to Texas A&M to an 
administrative position after that, I guess the,

12:38.134 --> 12:55.740
I almost changed my mind about coming. There was a 
very, very limited income farmer who was really

13:01.462 --> 13:31.165
struggling he had a large family i think he had 
eight or nine kids he was on a farmer's home

13:01.462 --> 13:31.165
administration loan he had very difficult times 
making and i guess i worked a little harder with him

13:01.462 --> 13:31.165
than i would have otherwise because he was 
struggling so hard to make it but totally a type of

13:01.462 --> 13:31.165
person who could not express his feelings 
whatsoever but the day that my decision had been

13:01.462 --> 13:31.165
announced to leave he came into my office with 
tears in his eyes he said

13:34.469 --> 13:37.252
And I said, I almost backed out. But anyway, I 
stayed there, as I said, about three and a half

13:37.272 --> 13:43.700
years, and then came up here in 1955, I guess. Down 
there, were there many minority farmers, black or

13:44.000 --> 13:47.464
Hispanic? Yes, there were, but we had a black 
staff. They worked separately, but we worked

13:49.366 --> 13:51.248
together. We had programs, joint programs. What 
about Hispanic? Not too many at that time. There

13:56.334 --> 14:03.042
were some, but they were mostly

13:56.334 --> 14:03.042
in terms of migratory people coming through, and 
now it's quite changed. There are many more

14:05.924 --> 14:13.092
Hispanics there, I've noticed, than there were at 
that time, but there were very few Hispanics that

14:05.924 --> 14:13.092
were farm operators at that time. But there were 
quite a few blacks who were farm operators,

14:13.372 --> 14:16.856
particularly in the eastern side of the county. 
Were there many sharecroppers, rent farmers?

14:20.680 --> 14:23.483
There were a lot of rent farmers, yeah, not 
sharecroppers. Most of the, most people, there

14:23.703 --> 14:32.252
were a lot of rent people that for the sake of 
someone who might not know the terminology of

14:32.401 --> 14:40.129
farming, explain the difference between 
sharecropping and rent farming. Well,

14:40.169 --> 14:46.035
sharecropping, you actually give, physically 
give a share of the crop to the, to the landowner. In

14:47.136 --> 14:57.226
renting, you either, you pay a certain 
percentage, at least call it thirds and fourths,

14:47.136 --> 14:57.226
things like that, and it's not actual commodity, 
it's the value. You produce ten bales of cotton,

14:57.767 --> 15:00.670
you're farming on fourth seed, you know, a fourth 
of that in cash, and you settled at the end of the

15:01.223 --> 15:05.888
year. Which was better? Renting, yeah. 
Sharecropping, I mean, it was, well, another

15:09.672 --> 15:25.290
difference in sharecropping was the landowner 
furnished everything, and in renting, you

15:09.672 --> 15:25.290
furnished everything, and the landowner only 
furnished the land, but still got a certain

15:09.672 --> 15:25.290
percentage of the crop in terms of monetary Was 
everybody then using mechanical equipment? Oh

15:29.664 --> 15:30.485
yeah. No mules or horses? Maybe a few small, very 
small farmers, but tractors were essentially

15:32.468 --> 15:42.239
universally used, and as I said, in the rice 
industry they were extremely mechanized. They

15:42.259 --> 15:50.028
had these huge humongous tractors then, and they 
did as many as three or four different operations

15:42.259 --> 15:50.028
with airplanes. They seeded by airplane, they put 
fertilizers out by airplane, they put out

15:55.713 --> 16:07.449
insecticides, herbicides, desiccants, I mean, 
except for plowing and combining the crop, most

15:55.713 --> 16:07.449
everything was done by airplanes. And you 
reported, in terms of the administrative

16:07.469 --> 16:14.138
organizational chart, you reported to whom? 
Well, there was an intermediate organization in

16:14.519 --> 16:24.032
the Extension Service called a district, made up 
of usually about 20 counties, and there was a

16:24.400 --> 16:32.309
supervisor for agriculture and a supervisor for 
home economics, and one that I reported to was

16:24.400 --> 16:32.309
located in Richmond. They had an office there. My 
supervisor was a fellow named Silver Whitsitt who

16:34.831 --> 16:42.820
had been earlier a county agent in a neighboring 
county where I grew up and had been one of my role

16:34.831 --> 16:42.820
models. I always tracked my career, and he was the 
one that offered me the first job when I got through

16:43.040 --> 16:48.226
with my master's. How did you know What were the 
measures of a successful county agent? How did you

16:53.296 --> 16:54.778
know you were doing well? Well, I guess in those 
days it was, I was one who always sought feedback.

17:03.369 --> 17:05.212
How am I doing, you know, that type of thing. And Mr. 
Whissett was a laid-back type of person. He said,

17:11.860 --> 17:14.504
if you don't see me much, you're doing okay. He 
said, I have to spend my time with the problem ones.

17:17.101 --> 17:19.664
That was about the valuation feedback I got. Am I 
correct, there were no quantitative

17:20.345 --> 17:26.993
measurements that the crops increased or 
decreased? Oh, you made reports. You had to make,

17:28.735 --> 17:31.138
it wasn't required by Washington. You have to have 
a report, and you must, you know, you were, but it

17:31.178 --> 17:43.412
was very difficult to do because the crops are 
dependent on weather and everything else, but it

17:31.178 --> 17:43.412
was mostly based, what evaluations were done was 
a, of organizations you had, the people you got

17:43.983 --> 17:48.390
involved, and people who attended your meetings. 
In fact, every meeting you had, you reported how

17:48.470 --> 17:51.976
many people were there. I got very good at 
estimating crowds. I could look at a large crowd

17:54.861 --> 17:57.646
and say there were 632 there. How many, can you give 
examples of any problems you encountered in that

17:58.387 --> 18:03.836
three years? Well, it's a very interesting 
assignment because you have to deal with all kinds

18:10.763 --> 18:14.487
of problems. And I was, I remember when I was early 
in the county, I had one of the very top leaders in

18:14.667 --> 18:34.106
the county, you know, one of the movers and shakers 
in the counties that you had to make sure that you

18:14.667 --> 18:34.106
didn't cross, came into my office only about two or 
three weeks after I was on the job, and really gave

18:14.667 --> 18:34.106
me a dressing down. I mean, from up down to the other 
end. I mean, he took it on himself to evaluate. And

18:39.029 --> 18:42.894
the problem was, he couldn't find me in the 
telephone book. Can you guess why? Because the

18:44.577 --> 18:46.519
book hadn't been printed? He was looking in the 
apps. Oh, oh, oh. He was very apologetic. The idea

18:52.888 --> 18:55.292
of a county agent not having a phone. And they would 
call you at five o'clock in the morning. They were

18:57.815 --> 18:59.057
up and working. They figured the whole world was 
up. And you might have come in at midnight from a

19:00.759 --> 19:04.565
night meeting, because we had a lot of night 
meetings. That's the only time farmers could come

19:04.605 --> 19:06.107
in. But it was a job that know generally took 78 
hours a week yeah just describe a typical week well

19:08.628 --> 19:36.323
it's hard that's i think one of the things that made 
the work interesting there were no two days alike i

19:08.628 --> 19:36.323
mean you uh you responded to requests uh we tried to 
i mean you did individual work but obviously when

19:08.628 --> 19:36.323
you have several thousand farmers in the county 
you can't visit everyone personally and we kept

19:08.628 --> 19:36.323
trying to use group methods you know if we if we did 
some insect work we'd ask the farmer to invite his

19:36.809 --> 20:06.512
neighbors in and you know we'd discuss problems 
and we'd have demonstrations on some places where

19:36.809 --> 20:06.512
we'd invite other farmers in we'd have meetings 
throughout you know throughout the county at

19:36.809 --> 20:06.512
nights and weekends and all of that we used the 
radio we had a weekly news column every which way to

19:36.809 --> 20:06.512
get the information out to as many people as 
possible and you know try to get the information

19:36.809 --> 20:06.512
you know try to be proactive try to get you know if 
it's spring you anticipated certain problems and

20:07.150 --> 20:19.982
And with a small county, you know, you have easy 
access to the radio, the newspaper, and all of

20:07.150 --> 20:19.982
that, because they're looking to fill public 
service time and have a weekly column in the paper,

20:07.150 --> 20:19.982
that type of thing. And how many hours were you in 
the office? Well, it got to, you know, people also

20:23.865 --> 20:36.837
complained if they could, if you weren't in the 
office, they'd say, well, that's all he does, he

20:23.865 --> 20:36.837
sits in his office, and there were agents that had 
that reputation, and others were never in the

20:23.865 --> 20:36.837
office. So I got to the habit of just setting a day 
that I would be in the office. I always was in the

20:41.813 --> 20:44.157
office, say, on Monday. Then I also set up because 
Palacios was so far away, and they always felt

20:44.718 --> 20:48.925
alienated. I worked a half a day there on 
Wednesdays. And I was a member of Rotary, and I made

20:52.791 --> 20:57.178
it nice that the Rotary Club met on Wednesdays 
there. And they helped me find a little place, and

20:58.140 --> 21:02.487
people wanted to catch me then in the county. It was 
part of the city hall. They'd take calls and

21:04.877 --> 21:07.359
requests when I'd come there. There were people 
that wanted to talk to me and so forth and, you know,

21:07.379 --> 21:12.384
kept publications there and so forth. But the 
whole effort was trying to, you know, get out

21:13.205 --> 21:19.592
information that was useful and helpful to 
farmers. And I think in those days, Extension made

21:19.672 --> 21:31.444
a big impact because the farmers were kept, you 
know, up to date on what varieties to plant, what,

21:19.672 --> 21:31.444
you know, how to deal with insect problems and all 
of this. Did you have to cope with any natural

21:32.318 --> 21:36.606
disasters? No hurricanes, no floods? Well, not 
there. Luckily, when I was there, there

21:40.414 --> 21:50.513
were no major hurricanes, but when I went to work in 
Wharton as assistant I reported the Monday after

21:50.830 --> 22:14.847
one of the worst hurricanes I ever had, and I 
remember going to the Danabank community, which

21:50.830 --> 22:14.847
was a Danish community on the line between 
Matagorda and Wharton County, that cotton bales,

21:50.830 --> 22:14.847
as you know, they weigh 500 pounds, they floated 
away from the cotton gin, and they were out in the

21:50.830 --> 22:14.847
fields, and they must have had 20 inches of rain 
after the storm came in, and You know, if you've

22:15.822 --> 22:21.249
ever smelled a pig pen, the whole country smelled 
that way because it had been underwater so long and

22:15.822 --> 22:21.249
everything rotted. It was a disaster. And we had to 
do a lot of work with trying to get, helping people

22:23.792 --> 22:30.500
get back on their feet and all of that. But that was 
the only major disaster I

22:30.520 --> 22:37.268
experienced. I had one other interesting 
experience. One of the rice cattle farmers there

22:43.818 --> 23:13.572
very active in our program, one of the leaders, and 
they operated cattle on the coastal marsh areas,

22:43.818 --> 23:13.572
and they would, in the wintertime, they put the 
cattle out on the barrier islands and peninsulas,

22:43.818 --> 23:13.572
on the salt grass areas, because there was a lot of 
forage there, and that's the only time a year to do

22:43.818 --> 23:13.572
it, because otherwise the mosquitoes were so bad, 
it was impossible to keep So they had, this

23:14.058 --> 23:21.268
particular operation had the entire southern 
part of Matagorda Peninsula. And they kept their

23:22.330 --> 23:25.975
cattle out there in the winter, and then you had 
this huge roundup. And he was always after me to

23:26.676 --> 23:29.640
join them in their roundups. And I said, I can't 
justify doing this. I have plenty of taste. But he

23:35.428 --> 23:37.111
just insisted that I do it. And it was a good 
experience, because it was really a throwback to

23:37.191 --> 23:43.660
the 1880s in Texas, because They started out at the 
mouth of the Colorado with their chuck wagon, with

23:44.365 --> 23:49.452
a black cook. They had about 20 or 30 horses with a 
lot of cowboys. They swam all of this across the

23:53.637 --> 23:55.860
mouth of the river. That's the only way you could 
access it. And the idea was they'd go about 20 or 30

23:58.223 --> 24:06.795
miles down to the end of the peninsula, and then 
round up the cattle and come back and swim them back

23:58.223 --> 24:06.795
across the river. Because when the spring came, 
they had to get them into interior lands. I hadn't

24:14.656 --> 24:40.925
ridden a horse in a long time, and he and I rode down 
there, and I suspect we must have ridden 150 miles

24:14.656 --> 24:40.925
that day, because not only, the truck wagon was 
right on the beach where the surf had made a hard

24:14.656 --> 24:40.925
surface, but he kept crisscrossing, checking 
windmills, checking salt blocks, and all of this,

24:14.656 --> 24:40.925
and I would have died if I had stayed there another 
day. It was wonderful eating there under the stars

24:41.266 --> 24:44.089
and everything, but He had arranged for a plane to 
pick me up the next morning, and I was so sore I could

24:44.238 --> 24:50.804
barely walk for a week. And if I had, as I said, if I 
had a way to ride another day, I'm sure I would have

24:51.565 --> 24:57.650
been absolutely incapacitated. Right. That was 
almost a half century ago. How has the farm

25:01.093 --> 25:07.679
economy, the agriculture economy of that county 
changed in these 50 years? Well, I'm not, I haven't

25:07.839 --> 25:14.025
been back there very often, but I can observe 
because a lot of times we, uh, host international

25:14.343 --> 25:17.546
visitors there and visit counties and so forth. 
The reality of farming nowadays is that there are

25:19.448 --> 25:25.593
very few bona fide farmers left as such. I remember 
we had a Chinese delegation here a few years ago,

25:26.774 --> 25:42.088
about 15 people, and we took them to a neighboring 
county, and they were very much interested in this

25:26.774 --> 25:42.088
particular question, and even though this was 
considered a top agricultural county, one of them

25:26.774 --> 25:42.088
asked them the question of how many farmers do you 
really have that depend you know basically on on

25:42.507 --> 26:09.460
farming for their life and he was kind of pressed 
against the wall and he said he'd have a hard time

25:42.507 --> 26:09.460
naming a dozen that would fit that category you 
know full-time farming farm nearly everyone

25:42.507 --> 26:09.460
nowadays it has off the farm employment or their 
wife works off the farm they've got to have some way

25:42.507 --> 26:09.460
of having a regular income because you have all 
kinds of monthly things to take care of. And many

26:13.330 --> 26:15.672
farmers do work off the farm now. And of course, 
there are many. And there's the other kind of

26:17.094 --> 26:23.321
people who have the attachment to the land who, 
once they get some resources, will buy a little

26:17.094 --> 26:23.321
place. So they cause a lot of activity for the 
agents because many of them are unknowledgeable

26:23.481 --> 26:35.194
about agriculture when they buy a place and they 
want to raise a few cattle and horses and things

26:23.481 --> 26:35.194
like that. Have the crops changed down there? Not 
too much. There's been a great big increase in

26:41.743 --> 26:46.093
Texas of corn production. I can remember growing 
up, when we used to grow corn, we'd make 15, 20

26:46.114 --> 26:51.446
bushels. We thought we made a reasonable crop. 
They regularly produce in Texas the same kind of

26:54.108 --> 27:06.623
yields now they do in the corn belt, like 100 
bushels, over 100 bushels an acre, with modern

26:54.108 --> 27:06.623
varieties, fertilizers, this type of thing, 
early maturing varieties. So there's lots of corn

27:06.643 --> 27:10.608
grown in Texas, a lot of grain sorghum. Rice 
continues. They've had their difficulties.

27:14.533 --> 27:20.740
Cotton has gone out in many areas, particularly in 
the eastern part of the states, only in the bottom

27:14.533 --> 27:20.740
lands, like here in Brazos County.

27:25.445 --> 27:29.397
drive over to Austin, there are a few little spots 
of cotton left that I know like in the community I

27:29.967 --> 27:37.094
grew up in, we had three cotton gins when I was 
growing up, working 24 hours a day from August

27:29.967 --> 27:37.094
through December. All gone. People that try to 
grow cotton have to go miles and miles to get their

27:39.417 --> 27:44.102
cotton gins. Right. That's, in my case, in 
Garland, Dallas suburb. Exactly the same. There

27:48.566 --> 27:49.427
were three gins. My grandparents thought that the 
co-op gin was communistic. And they, there were

27:55.654 --> 27:58.877
two private owned and then one co-op. And I don't 
know where the nearest gin is now. Well, that's

28:03.103 --> 28:12.417
what, there was a little revival of interest in 
some of those areas recently, but I heard some

28:03.103 --> 28:12.417
farmers had to go like over a hundred miles to, over 
a hundred miles to get a gin. So you, how did you get

28:13.398 --> 28:24.975
the, how did the contact come about coming back, 
back here to come back to the campus? I always had, I

28:28.068 --> 28:33.133
guess it was related to my thesis work that I did for 
my master's. I had to write a thesis in Michigan.

28:35.916 --> 28:43.844
And they wanted somebody to give some in-depth 
study to the problem of staffing counties. How

28:43.864 --> 28:48.368
many counties do you need in this county, and so 
forth. And I developed a procedure working up

28:48.388 --> 28:58.058
there of how to, what we called, measure the 
extension workload of trying to justify whether

28:48.388 --> 28:58.058
it was six-agent county or whatever it was. I did 
that. In fact, it got known, and I've heard run into

29:03.755 --> 29:11.165
Michigan staffers many years later that still 
referred to the Foxfield formula. Anyway, that

29:11.826 --> 29:22.601
came to the attention of the administrators here, 
and they were concerned with the same problem, but

29:11.826 --> 29:22.601
they were also concerned with another problem of 
financing. Everything up to then, the

29:22.741 --> 29:29.310
legislation authorizing extension work in Texas 
counties was permissive. They just said the

29:29.898 --> 29:39.287
extension service could enter into agreements 
with the local county commissioners' court as to

29:29.898 --> 29:39.287
staffing and payment and so forth. And everything 
was pretty informal and not structured in any

29:39.968 --> 29:48.016
which way. I mean, if a county was willing to pay for 
extra agents, they wanted four. Whether or not you

29:52.900 --> 29:55.243
could justify it or not, they'd get four. If they 
wanted six, they'd get six, that type of thing. And

29:58.306 --> 29:59.787
about that time, I don't know if you remember, 
there was a lot of restructuring of the school's

30:00.526 --> 30:20.150
financing system in Texas, the Gilmer-Akin bill, 
where the concept was developed that the poor,

30:00.526 --> 30:20.150
so-called poor counties, that means according to 
tax base, would get more state support than richer

30:00.526 --> 30:20.150
counties. I mean, it was trying to equalize the big 
oil counties and so forth. And this was of interest

30:23.775 --> 30:29.402
to the administration here that they felt they had 
to have a more rational way of

30:29.990 --> 30:42.881
measuring workload, too, but tying this also to 
how much a county should be expected to

30:29.990 --> 30:42.881
contribute. It varied all the way from 20% to 80%. I 
mean, in, say, a so-called rich county, a county

30:46.784 --> 30:59.355
that had a high tax base, if they insisted on extra 
agents, and the extension service felt

30:46.784 --> 30:59.355
stretching it a little, they might only 
participate a little bit, but the county would pay

31:00.112 --> 31:05.719
everything, or that part of that. But you got, 
started getting, the county judges started

31:06.079 --> 31:20.837
comparing things, you know, I've got as much as 
you've got, how come you've got this, and so they

31:06.079 --> 31:20.837
wanted some kind of a formalized structure, and I 
was brought in as an
