WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:05.654
So you say you all did watch it?

00:05.774 --> 00:06.255
Absolutely.

00:06.836 --> 00:12.404
We watched it there a couple times, and I'd watched it, I think, before that somehow.

00:13.085 --> 00:15.209
It was one of the great patriotic movies.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.490
Me and my dad was nagging.

00:16.510 --> 00:21.618
I thought I wanted to go to A&M, so I think I watched it when it first came out before going to A&M.

00:23.401 --> 00:23.781
Let's see.

00:23.842 --> 00:29.430
Here in my notes, did you and your buddies ever go into the steam tunnels?

00:29.798 --> 00:33.183
No, but I remember hearing something about it, but I didn't.

00:33.424 --> 00:35.307
Some of them probably did, but I didn't.

00:35.327 --> 00:38.151
Were you aware that there were some secret fraternities?

00:38.331 --> 00:40.014
Yes, yeah.

00:40.034 --> 00:42.618
But I didn't know any more about that because they never asked me to join.

00:43.079 --> 00:44.641
Do you know how many there were?

00:44.861 --> 00:45.723
I don't.

00:45.743 --> 00:49.889
You know, when my dad were there, they had secret fraternities back then.

00:49.929 --> 00:52.854
They called them the Bull Moose or something when he was there.

00:52.914 --> 00:57.561
One of my friends, Eddie Thompson, was in one, and they got a big stink our senior year.

00:57.845 --> 01:05.194
You know, what would surprise some people, and I was very, there's a reason behind everything.

01:05.935 --> 01:14.965
I was very popular, very outgoing in high school, captain of the football team, president of the band, president of the thespians, et cetera, et cetera.

01:14.985 --> 01:17.408
I ran for student council of Texas.

01:17.428 --> 01:19.130
The people before me were elected.

01:19.191 --> 01:25.037
Fort Stockton was going to be, their president would be president of student council of Texas.

01:25.058 --> 01:27.160
I ran for that, and I was defeated.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.066
But very narrowly.

01:30.287 --> 01:32.582
It really hurt me deeply.

01:32.602 --> 01:35.580
And so I said, well, that's it for politics.

01:35.695 --> 01:40.901
I'm going to go get an education, and I'm not going to be involved in everything at school.

01:40.921 --> 01:45.487
And I said, it's time for me to try to get some brains and don't worry about popularity.

01:45.507 --> 01:50.813
So my focus at A&M was very different than it's been a lot of other times in my life.

01:51.414 --> 01:56.079
I went, I had a purpose, and I didn't try out for Yale leader, any of those things.

01:56.119 --> 01:56.800
I went to school.

01:57.861 --> 02:00.304
And it was because of that event that happened earlier.

02:01.426 --> 02:03.508
During your student days,

02:03.488 --> 02:09.625
the most visible student leaders were, what positions?

02:10.026 --> 02:18.088
Yale leaders, and probably Yale leaders, probably drum majors, well, Yale leaders, and then the

02:21.393 --> 02:24.678
Probably the president of the... Senior?

02:24.858 --> 02:33.271
Senior president and of course the Colonel of the Corps, the Corps leaders, you know, company commanders, those.

02:34.072 --> 02:38.218
And outside of that, there was not a high social activity at A&M.

02:38.839 --> 02:42.264
There was, but it wasn't like a lot of schools.

02:43.306 --> 02:46.270
Maybe that's because we always left on the weekends, you know.

02:46.290 --> 02:47.552
Did...

02:49.996 --> 02:54.068
Tell me about freshman year bonfire for you.

02:54.991 --> 02:55.472
Miserable.

02:56.094 --> 02:56.796
Work.

02:56.816 --> 02:57.499
How long?

02:57.519 --> 02:57.980
Oh, I don't know.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.304
It just went on and on forever.

02:59.565 --> 03:00.006
Oh, really?

03:01.167 --> 03:07.473
I remember how long, but I remember you out there raining on you, people hollering at you, and it was no fun at all.

03:07.893 --> 03:13.738
And as a freshman, as a fish, did you all cut any or just haul?

03:13.758 --> 03:15.600
We cut.

03:15.620 --> 03:16.981
I think we just did hauling.

03:17.001 --> 03:18.382
I don't think we did any cutting.

03:19.003 --> 03:22.886
I think we did more just odds and ends labor, hauling the logs.

03:23.487 --> 03:26.930
And we weren't much involved in putting up the bonfire either.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.571
Where was it?

03:28.591 --> 03:29.352
On drill field?

03:30.142 --> 03:34.469
Bonfire was on the field, yeah, the drill field in front of MSC back then.

03:34.489 --> 03:36.573
Yeah, and it was the whole time I was there.

03:36.813 --> 03:38.175
Do you remember anybody getting hurt?

03:38.496 --> 03:40.419
No, but they probably did.

03:40.459 --> 03:46.670
And this was not during the time when the Longhorns tried to bomb?

03:46.690 --> 03:47.691
Yes, it was the time.

03:47.892 --> 03:48.152
Oh, really?

03:48.172 --> 03:50.496
Yeah, they came over, maybe it was a year before.

03:50.948 --> 03:53.571
But yeah, they came over in the airplane and tried to light the fire.

03:54.092 --> 03:56.995
That was part of it trying, you know, that was just good BS.

03:57.015 --> 04:00.219
Like trying to steal a baler bear, light their fire, they'd light up.

04:00.239 --> 04:03.102
See if you could sneak in and get their fire going prematurely.

04:03.482 --> 04:04.323
You had to have guards.

04:04.363 --> 04:06.566
I remember guarding the bonfire zone and some of that.

04:07.867 --> 04:11.171
What about muster?

04:11.652 --> 04:12.893
Do you remember going to muster?

04:12.913 --> 04:16.197
Yeah, muster was always very emotional.

04:16.480 --> 04:24.252
But I think it became more emotional after you graduated, much more, as you knew so-and-so was killed in Korea.

04:24.812 --> 04:26.254
You start mentioning his name.

04:26.335 --> 04:31.182
And then maybe one of you, in the early days, you know, all of our peers were in the Air Force.

04:31.202 --> 04:33.365
There'd be plane crashes killed in combat.

04:33.846 --> 04:36.750
So you'd read in the Aggie, so you'd know.

04:36.730 --> 04:41.558
Up to this, you know, you know who was killed in action, which in my early days we had a lot of that.

04:42.219 --> 04:49.831
Later then, you know, as your classmates get older and they die, so muster's always, always been very emotional to all Aggies.

04:50.031 --> 04:54.439
Did your dad ever say anything about muster or bonfire in his days?

04:55.180 --> 04:58.605
The muster was really just cranking off in 15.

04:58.746 --> 04:59.667
It wasn't the...

04:59.647 --> 05:07.419
Like, really, the muster, the Corregidor muster, as we all know, was the great, and that put the muster, you know, like that was the next step up.

05:07.439 --> 05:08.320
Yes, you're correct.

05:08.481 --> 05:25.587
I think that my dad, actually, he probably had his, he went back to Paris when they formed the American Legion after World War I. But his allegiance was more to the first officers that he went through combat with, that he went into the service with, more than A&M.

05:26.225 --> 05:29.152
But A&M was still just building in 1950.

05:29.633 --> 05:30.855
What was it?

05:30.875 --> 05:35.446
11 years of this century and a few of the last.

05:35.526 --> 05:39.154
I mean, they were still really a pretty new school when he was there.

05:39.556 --> 05:44.404
So the Corregidor Mustard Knows started and you get just like the former students.

05:44.424 --> 05:48.491
Look what it's done in the last 20 years compared to the years before that.

05:48.691 --> 05:53.639
It's like the magazine didn't get started until 30 years ago or something like that.

05:54.180 --> 05:57.025
And I'm predicting that

05:57.005 --> 06:10.907
bonfire tragedy a year and a half ago in which 12 people died, 12th man, I'm guessing that in a few years that will become an important part.

06:10.927 --> 06:11.668
It absolutely will.

06:12.129 --> 06:13.951
It won't be a few years, it'll be quickly.

06:14.472 --> 06:17.136
Like I did the muster in Albuquerque 2000.

06:17.236 --> 06:17.597
Yeah.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.725
And the squad leader

06:24.865 --> 06:42.748
of the group of the squad in which the last two victims were members, he and his family live in Albuquerque, and he had the flag that was hanging out there on the pile that night.

06:44.770 --> 06:50.738
And so instead of lighting a candle for every person whose name they called,

06:52.034 --> 06:55.699
We let 12 candles and they were put

06:56.219 --> 06:57.180
in a shape like this.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.823
Like a bonfire, yeah.

06:58.923 --> 07:01.146
There'd be great tradition to grow out of that.

07:01.507 --> 07:04.211
And, you know, that probably could have happened years before.

07:04.311 --> 07:09.379
I think it was poorly managed by the seniors, and it's a shame we lost lives.

07:09.419 --> 07:14.687
But they'll build, there'll be a re-engineered bonfire, they'll have time, and it'll become a great tradition.

07:14.767 --> 07:15.869
It'll all work out all right.

07:16.189 --> 07:22.058
Now, in your era, you all were cutting down the trees with axes.

07:23.067 --> 07:26.070
Axes, and there were some big saws.

07:26.130 --> 07:26.731
Oh, big saws.

07:26.851 --> 07:27.071
Yeah.

07:27.271 --> 07:28.132
But no power saws.

07:28.152 --> 07:29.934
No, they didn't have them then.

07:29.954 --> 07:33.257
I hate to admit I'm that damn old, but they didn't have power saws then.

07:33.277 --> 07:37.402
And nothing was put on bonfire except the trunks of the trees.

07:37.422 --> 07:38.383
The trunks of the trees.

07:38.623 --> 07:38.823
No trash.

07:38.843 --> 07:39.564
No, no trash.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.486
Trunks of the trees and the outhouse.

07:42.006 --> 07:44.869
That outhouse has been on there forever, I think.

07:44.889 --> 07:48.973
As far as you know, it was a real outhouse that came from somebody's private property.

07:48.994 --> 07:49.234
Yeah, yeah.

07:49.454 --> 07:50.475
Yeah, I think so.

07:50.455 --> 08:04.270
I've learned in the 20s that what happened quite often is the outhouse owner went to the campus and told them that he'd like to donate his, and in return they would give him a new outhouse, which was better.

08:04.290 --> 08:07.814
Oh, I didn't know that.

08:07.834 --> 08:10.497
Yeah, I think they were real outhouses.

08:10.637 --> 08:11.759
You know, I don't know that.

08:11.919 --> 08:13.020
That was my thought.

08:13.000 --> 08:21.252
When you're a freshman down there, things are going on and, you know, you're so involved in trying to survive that there's a lot of things that I didn't know all was going on.

08:21.272 --> 08:22.994
You know, really knew very little ago.

08:23.695 --> 08:25.358
What about Silver Taps?

08:25.798 --> 08:26.319
Yeah.

08:26.379 --> 08:29.964
Silver Taps was a smaller enough end, very, very, very emotional.

08:30.345 --> 08:32.207
We'd fall out when somebody was killed.

08:33.068 --> 08:41.961
We'd fall out that day, whenever it was, you know, two or three days after they were killed, walk silently to the administration building to place Silver Taps, go back and go to bed.

08:42.515 --> 08:43.357
And never say a word.

08:44.439 --> 08:45.381
Back in the 70s.

08:45.641 --> 08:48.307
Now they have so many that they have to combine them.

08:48.327 --> 08:55.201
But it was right at CQ when you were through, called a quarter, then you were through, that happened then.

08:55.742 --> 08:58.448
So it took about 45 minutes to walk over.

08:58.968 --> 09:01.095
then have a silver tap and then come back.

09:02.659 --> 09:04.405
Most people just, I'd generally go to bed then.

09:04.425 --> 09:07.534
Did everybody take it seriously?

09:07.615 --> 09:09.560
Oh yeah, it was serious.

09:09.581 --> 09:13.011
See, now it's okay to go back and turn your lights on.

09:14.054 --> 09:18.141
Well, there may have been some lights on, but it was so emotional then.

09:18.622 --> 09:20.305
And all military, we had to go.

09:20.405 --> 09:21.748
So you had a big crowd.

09:21.808 --> 09:24.954
Where today, it's voluntary, except for the military.

09:25.635 --> 09:26.837
So you had a big crowd.

09:26.977 --> 09:27.759
It was emotional.

09:28.220 --> 09:31.305
The time you get back, it's 11.30 or something like that.

09:31.445 --> 09:36.214
And mostly, you just maybe wash your face something and go to bed.

09:36.194 --> 09:51.992
In the early 70s when I was dean of faculties, a student group came to me for advice and an Aggie student who had been involved in a burglary in Brenham was driving too fast to try to get away and was killed in the wreck.

09:52.293 --> 09:57.340
And the big question was, do they have silver taps or not?

09:57.540 --> 10:00.043
And they came to me and said, please give us advice.

10:00.303 --> 10:06.391
And I said, well, since I didn't go to Texas A&M, I've only been here 20 years working here.

10:06.411 --> 10:12.439
It's not appropriate for me to give you advice except to say, you all decide, was this student an Aggie or not?

10:13.020 --> 10:13.120
Yeah.

10:14.146 --> 10:17.410
If that student's an Aggie, isn't that the question?

10:17.430 --> 10:17.990
Yeah, yeah.

10:18.971 --> 10:22.735
And they, if I'm not mistaken, they decide yes.

10:22.755 --> 10:23.636
I think they had to have it.

10:24.077 --> 10:25.258
They didn't have to be proud of him.

10:25.358 --> 10:26.520
Right, right.

10:26.540 --> 10:27.320
I think they had to have it.

10:27.721 --> 10:28.402
How could they not?

10:30.464 --> 10:30.824
Let's see.

10:32.386 --> 10:36.390
First, do you remember the first final review your freshman year?

10:37.492 --> 10:38.713
Yeah, but it didn't hit me.

10:39.294 --> 10:41.436
It's your last final review that hits you.

10:41.855 --> 10:42.617
Oh, really?

10:43.118 --> 10:45.023
Make believe I wouldn't understand that.

10:45.444 --> 10:47.910
Why is final review important?

10:48.391 --> 10:56.050
It's the end, you know, and it's that there's a, the deep love comes out.

10:56.840 --> 11:04.154
I've got a picture probably here of me with a final review because I didn't, I was always very distressed that I didn't go ahead and stay and get a commission.

11:05.577 --> 11:08.563
And so I have a picture of me in a blue shirt with all my outfit.

11:09.285 --> 11:10.988
I went to join them after review.

11:11.228 --> 11:15.557
It was a sense, you know, there's things in your life that are failure,

11:15.537 --> 11:21.145
that you try to overcome later on like the Napoleon complex if you're short or something.

11:21.165 --> 11:29.738
And that's probably one of the reasons that I've been more of a noisy Aggies because I had some regrets of things I didn't do when I was there.

11:30.419 --> 11:32.021
I think that's pretty much human nature.

11:33.143 --> 11:34.525
So you didn't have senior boots?

11:34.685 --> 11:36.148
No, I didn't have senior boots.

11:36.628 --> 11:39.593
Because I was going to ask, how much did they cost and where did you get them?

11:39.613 --> 11:41.075
No, I didn't have senior boots.

11:42.417 --> 11:43.198
Commencement.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.212
Where was commencement held?

11:45.252 --> 11:48.716
Commencement was in Raleigh White.

11:49.057 --> 11:49.397
Okay.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.683
And describe people who came.

11:53.863 --> 11:56.506
Commencement, well, they mail them.

11:56.786 --> 12:02.394
I didn't graduate because I told you I laid out one semester, so I finished the summer semester six weeks more.

12:03.075 --> 12:04.276
And so I had to mail mine.

12:04.677 --> 12:07.380
You know, the commencement wasn't the deal.

12:08.035 --> 12:10.560
the final review was the deal.

12:10.580 --> 12:19.338
Commencement, the degree was secondary, the final review of the military, that was what was the deal.

12:19.418 --> 12:25.470
As you look back on all those years, if all the faculty and staff

12:26.902 --> 12:34.670
from your time could be present, which ones would you most want to thank and for why would you want to thank them?

12:34.690 --> 12:39.035
Well, Kunkel would be number one because he brought so much excitement to learning.

12:40.857 --> 12:48.185
The guy Fish, the English teacher who brought me out into debates and stuff like that.

12:48.205 --> 12:53.230
Here's an ag kid that he helped me with a little different direction.

12:55.538 --> 13:01.448
I think the top, Harrington was important as a symbol.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.451
That's the president, you know.

13:03.511 --> 13:14.069
Then I'd thank some of the juniors and seniors when I was, could have gotten kicked out because I was used to being wild and free and here I'm confined.

13:14.149 --> 13:17.074
And the seniors are my outfit.

13:18.472 --> 13:23.378
But, you know, we just didn't have any bad professors at that time.

13:24.159 --> 13:36.614
And I think one difference, at least that I saw when I was teaching down there, the professors in that time were really totally dedicated to teaching.

13:36.634 --> 13:39.858
And they weren't worried about research or my career, that stuff.

13:40.378 --> 13:43.582
And so it was a little bit like my Fort Stockton High School.

13:44.303 --> 13:45.484
They nurtured us.

13:45.504 --> 13:46.926
I mean, when they got through culling,

13:47.429 --> 13:53.453
When the kids that couldn't make it, when they got through that, they nurtured, like Pappy Potts, for example.

13:53.474 --> 13:54.839
I'd thank him for sure.

13:55.462 --> 13:57.068
They nurtured us.

13:58.837 --> 14:11.518
A lot of those great, great guys, not many women there, nearly all men, they were such a part of the system of our whole event, and they cared about us.

14:12.379 --> 14:13.100
They truly did.

14:13.120 --> 14:22.015
I'd want to thank every darn one of them, but some opened my eyes to some things.

14:22.155 --> 14:23.798
We were so fortunate.

14:23.778 --> 14:30.005
to have the leadership and the teacher, the teacher, not professor, teachers.

14:30.626 --> 14:32.548
They taught us.

14:33.049 --> 14:37.654
What contributes to this great pride that so many people have in the school?

14:38.715 --> 14:44.962
I've got a gift from my daughter, my future daughter-in-law, who's in ag here, will be, will graduate.

14:45.002 --> 14:49.707
She says, those inside can't explain it and those outside can't understand it.

14:50.128 --> 14:51.129
There's a little plaque on that.

14:51.149 --> 14:52.030
I thought it was pretty good.

14:53.849 --> 15:03.528
Initially, I'm pretty sure it's the sense of achievement that we went through something tough.

15:03.548 --> 15:05.231
And we made it.

15:05.251 --> 15:06.353
I saw a spirit like that.

15:06.394 --> 15:12.786
I was waiting tables in mineral wells after hours in the Army in the Lost Battalion.

15:13.053 --> 15:37.862
came there they were conquered and you probably know that and there was a spirit that they had that those men had that was very similar to what A&M men had that they had been through a very difficult situation it made them it made the freshmen it cleaves you together when everybody else is your enemy the juniors are the seniors the sophomores everybody's your enemy you're all you got your old lady and so that's number one

15:38.635 --> 15:40.537
You cleave together in difficult times.

15:40.597 --> 15:46.224
No matter where mankind faces difficult times, you have to fight the enemy.

15:46.244 --> 15:48.526
Second, then, that you made it.

15:50.168 --> 15:54.814
And you know that you went through difficult stuff, and three out of four didn't make it.

15:54.834 --> 15:56.215
So enters the pride.

15:56.816 --> 16:01.641
This is in the early formative days, where the pride then starts the tradition.

16:02.182 --> 16:03.944
And then you have the Medal of Honor with it.

16:03.984 --> 16:06.567
It all ties basically to the military.

16:07.508 --> 16:14.178
I'm the first to say I wasn't a military guy, but it's very clear to me that the military is the reason that we have the school we do at A&M.

16:14.758 --> 16:31.322
The military, the tradition, the heroes, the corregidor muster, the climbing the cliffs at France, pointing to the hock, and so all these things keep building and you start building tradition like King Gill and just the whole thing.

16:31.923 --> 16:36.570
Then here's the core, that's the C-O-R-E.

16:37.276 --> 16:40.320
The nucleus of our spirit comes from the military.

16:41.321 --> 16:43.463
Now, it's that big, and the school is this big.

16:44.064 --> 16:51.993
But the students have grabbed in, the outside students that are not in the military, don't plan a career, they have picked up those traditions.

16:52.013 --> 16:56.398
And the spirit is still, that's the revolver around the Corps of Cadets.

16:57.239 --> 16:58.761
And there's still a heartbeat of A&M.

16:58.781 --> 17:01.685
My band's a heartbeat, but the Corps is a key.

17:02.426 --> 17:06.270
And somehow, I've been so proud of everybody there in that.

17:06.537 --> 17:13.007
We've been able to grow into a very large university and have most of the spirit.

17:13.027 --> 17:15.931
Now, my son will never have the spirit I do because he wasn't in the military.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.934
He didn't go through what I went through.

17:17.954 --> 17:18.976
But he's got a lot of it.

17:19.937 --> 17:26.267
Probably got as much as he could have, not actually going through and living through the freshman, sophomore years.

17:27.226 --> 17:31.732
I enjoy telling after the machine was turned off with Bill Clayton.

17:31.752 --> 17:32.793
Yeah.

17:32.813 --> 17:40.062
We're talking about co-education, not combinator core and all that, and he said that those proposals came up during his first term in the legislature.

17:40.483 --> 17:44.047
He said, I didn't speak up, didn't say anything, but I was really opposed to them.

17:44.067 --> 17:44.688
I want to.

17:44.708 --> 17:46.791
And I said, well, I'm interested.

17:46.871 --> 17:47.832
Why were you opposed to them?

17:47.852 --> 17:50.495
And he said, I thought they'd kill the spirit, particularly the women.

17:51.096 --> 17:51.176
Yep.

17:51.196 --> 17:51.997
I said, you're kidding.

17:52.017 --> 17:52.678
And he said, no.

17:52.918 --> 17:54.280
Do the women have spirit?

17:54.260 --> 17:58.285
I said, sir, as far as I can tell, the A&M women today may have more spirits.

17:58.305 --> 17:59.427
May have probably more.

17:59.447 --> 18:02.471
And he hit the table and said, good, because my three granddaughters are all there.

18:02.491 --> 18:02.911
That's right.

18:03.072 --> 18:05.254
And I was against it when it was going on.

18:05.555 --> 18:09.760
Of course, at a distance, well, there weren't any girls there, you shouldn't have any now.

18:11.102 --> 18:14.026
Two daughters at A&M graduating.

18:14.046 --> 18:16.449
So, yeah.

18:16.469 --> 18:19.894
But we didn't see it, and we didn't say, well, we couldn't understand.

18:19.934 --> 18:23.338
It took somebody like Earl Rudder to lead us through that period of time

18:23.774 --> 18:26.397
Because he recognized there weren't going to be enough commissions.

18:26.417 --> 18:27.839
The military didn't have a future.

18:28.319 --> 18:36.168
And he was, with his heroic background, was able to push it through where a lot of people couldn't have put that through because we were against it.

18:36.228 --> 18:37.830
I mean, we were 90% against it.

18:38.591 --> 18:39.692
So see, what do we know?

18:40.813 --> 18:48.482
I asked Ed Cooper, who was it, how was it, where was it that apparently got Mr. Rudder really committed to it?

18:49.424 --> 18:54.293
He said, I've been working on that one for about 30 years, and I think I got the pieces and the jigsaw puzzle together.

18:54.854 --> 18:56.957
He said, I think it happened at a bed and breakfast.

18:57.739 --> 18:58.260
I said, what?

18:58.801 --> 19:11.263
He said, maybe at 2 in the morning after two old friends had shared a cool beverage when the President of the United States at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue put his arm around the former mayor of Brady, Texas,

19:11.362 --> 19:16.949
who had led that president's 1948 Senate campaign in the Hill Country counties.

19:17.449 --> 19:30.244
He said, apparently LBJ, on one of Mr. Rudder's trips to Washington, said, Earl, if you expect to keep coming up here to Washington and getting lots of money out of the federal government, you're going to have to get A&M moving because it's standing still and other schools are passing you by.

19:30.304 --> 19:32.246
You don't have a choice in integration.

19:32.266 --> 19:34.269
The courts have decided that.

19:34.289 --> 19:34.509
Yeah, yeah.

19:34.529 --> 19:35.931
Now, who knows what about women?

19:36.972 --> 19:38.173
They may decide that, too.

19:38.774 --> 19:39.715
Now, I'll back you.

19:40.454 --> 19:42.858
Tiger, your classmate, he'll back you.

19:42.878 --> 19:43.218
Yeah, yeah.

19:43.238 --> 19:51.751
John Conley and Nele and your wife were classmates at the University of Texas all four years and were in student government together.

19:51.951 --> 19:53.353
He'll back you.

19:53.373 --> 19:56.898
Jake Pickle and you have known each other since you were eighth graders.

19:57.239 --> 19:57.940
He'll back you.

19:58.661 --> 19:58.761
Yeah.

19:58.781 --> 20:06.492
Well, and you and I know that John Lindsay and others and the former students, and come on, Earl, get it done.

20:06.512 --> 20:07.213
Yeah, I'll be back.

20:07.233 --> 20:07.914
And I agree with you.

20:08.054 --> 20:09.256
Only Mr. Rudder could.

20:09.356 --> 20:09.837
Yeah, he probably could.

20:10.103 --> 20:12.208
Lennon himself couldn't have done it, we'd have gone the other way.

20:12.328 --> 20:12.749
That's right.

20:13.030 --> 20:14.674
Yeah, Earl could have, yeah.

20:14.694 --> 20:20.949
But it had to happen, and it was surprising to me that many of us were so hard-headed and so short-sighted at the time.

20:21.911 --> 20:27.825
What are the events in an Aggie's experience that contribute most to this Aggie spirit?

20:31.366 --> 20:34.151
I think I'd call it event rather than plural.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.896
I think going through those difficult times together.

20:38.118 --> 20:40.782
I'm talking about my spirit.

20:40.802 --> 20:42.846
Going through the difficult times together.

20:42.866 --> 20:47.434
And actually, it is very much now centered around the football team.

20:47.498 --> 20:48.099
Very much.

20:48.119 --> 20:49.160
I mean, not just the way it is.

20:49.320 --> 20:52.143
A lot of folks don't like it, but our Aggie spirit.

20:52.163 --> 20:54.825
I made pep talks when Jackie Sherrill was there to the team.

20:55.306 --> 21:05.275
Every tough game, and what I tried to put forward, that our love for A&M as former students, once we're out, is expressed mostly through football.

21:05.295 --> 21:06.096
It's not basketball.

21:06.116 --> 21:06.717
It's not track.

21:06.737 --> 21:07.898
It's not baseball.

21:07.918 --> 21:12.242
It's through the football, the parade, the march in, the event, the band, the half.

21:12.623 --> 21:15.025
And that's where we express that Aggie spirit.

21:15.005 --> 21:23.457
Looking back on your student years, what did you learn at Texas A&M that's been important to you in all the years since then?

21:27.703 --> 21:29.205
There's two things probably.

21:29.245 --> 21:31.568
The first I learned as a sophomore in military science.

21:33.010 --> 21:36.836
And they took a string and put it on the desk, a soft cotton string.

21:37.877 --> 21:40.641
They said, Williams, push this string to the other side of the desk.

21:41.836 --> 21:43.682
Well, it's hard to push because it wads up.

21:44.645 --> 21:45.668
You can't push across well.

21:46.431 --> 21:48.678
Now, Williams, pull that string across.

21:49.822 --> 21:50.283
Leadership.

21:51.447 --> 21:55.440
So as I built pipelines or done things, or worked cattle,

21:55.842 --> 21:58.545
I never asked my men to do anything I don't do.

21:58.565 --> 22:01.448
That's the military leadership training, leadership.

22:02.328 --> 22:07.393
The other is just basically an educational formula that I learned to organize.

22:07.453 --> 22:15.902
I learned to organize my work, to work, to organize, to understand the growing of a mind that happened there.

22:15.922 --> 22:17.183
Those two things in my case.

22:18.284 --> 22:21.107
And probably what plays the best in the history is that string.

22:21.087 --> 22:26.853
And every time I speak to the Corps, any group down there, I'll always use the string.

22:26.873 --> 22:27.954
Well, that's true leadership.

22:28.815 --> 22:31.018
And the military has to have it.

22:32.679 --> 22:33.901
Aggie ring.

22:34.421 --> 22:36.523
You remember when you bought your first one?

22:36.543 --> 22:38.466
Yeah, I do.

22:38.486 --> 22:39.607
It was somebody else's ring.

22:41.289 --> 22:43.050
Because I was a semester behind.

22:43.090 --> 22:43.691
You remember out there?

22:43.711 --> 22:44.532
I missed that semester.

22:45.193 --> 22:48.276
All right, all the rest of my group is going to graduate, and I don't have a ring yet.

22:49.420 --> 22:51.983
So I got another guy to order me a ring so I could wear a ring.

22:53.065 --> 22:56.790
Later, I don't wear a ring today because I can't wear anything brass.

22:56.830 --> 22:57.912
It just drives me nuts.

22:59.434 --> 23:03.199
And that's maybe another reason because I can't have my Aggie ring.

23:03.599 --> 23:08.586
I want people to know damn sure I'm an Aggie because the ring, I can't wear it.

23:08.606 --> 23:09.628
So I've accomplished that.

23:10.008 --> 23:11.009
Aggie flag out there.

23:11.430 --> 23:13.673
How did you feel when you first put that ring on there?

23:13.653 --> 23:15.477
Oh, good as hell.

23:15.497 --> 23:18.846
Even though it wasn't mine yet, I'd earned it and I knew it would.

23:19.307 --> 23:21.913
Do you have any ring stories about you lost it?

23:22.013 --> 23:26.464
Yeah, I got in a fight one time.

23:28.098 --> 23:30.461
I took it off because I didn't want to hit the guy with my ring.

23:30.641 --> 23:31.162
I don't know why.

23:31.202 --> 23:32.945
I should have gone ahead and hit him with the ring.

23:32.985 --> 23:33.826
I'd done more damage.

23:34.186 --> 23:35.128
And I lost it there.

23:35.148 --> 23:36.830
So I've ordered two or three now.

23:36.890 --> 23:41.557
And have you ever been somewhere as a stranger and somebody spotted it?

23:41.637 --> 23:42.358
Oh, always.

23:42.378 --> 23:44.821
Well, always because I don't wear a ring.

23:44.841 --> 23:45.642
I just can't wear it.

23:46.423 --> 23:47.665
But I'm always looking.

23:47.725 --> 23:50.689
You'll rarely see an Aggie that I don't see his ring.

23:51.050 --> 23:55.356
And mostly they know I'm an Aggie, so they put it out there where I can see it.

23:55.956 --> 23:56.797
We Aggies do that.

23:56.858 --> 23:57.919
We're proud of it.

23:58.051 --> 24:01.476
We're proud of being an Aggie and achieving what it took to get there.

24:01.496 --> 24:17.477
In doing an interview with Dr. Bowen not long ago, that question, he said that after he graduated, he went to Caltech, and then he goes to Europe for three months in the summer, and he's on the train going from Vienna

24:17.457 --> 24:18.338
Yeah.

24:19.921 --> 24:28.896
And this, he thought, old lady was seated across from him on the train, and she looks at him, he's reading the newspaper, looks at him and said, is that an Aggie ring?

24:30.098 --> 24:32.082
And he said, well, yes, ma'am, how would you know?

24:32.122 --> 24:34.065
You know, how do you recognize an Aggie ring?

24:34.433 --> 24:36.957
And she introduced herself, her husband's name was H.B.

24:36.977 --> 24:37.477
Zachary.

24:38.138 --> 24:40.822
I mean, they would know for sure.

24:40.842 --> 24:41.804
Wouldn't they?

24:41.824 --> 24:43.707
What a great Aggie family that was, too.

24:43.727 --> 24:45.710
Yes, yes, yes.

24:47.332 --> 24:59.530
Well, what have we, what have we, oh, what advice, you're now a consultant, what advice would you give to the leaders of Texas A&M today?

25:00.370 --> 25:01.411
Well, that's the whole book.

25:03.734 --> 25:04.234
Seriously.

25:07.177 --> 25:17.428
I'm unendingly concerned about the academia against A&M.

25:20.772 --> 25:29.922
The Faculty Senate in some cases, in other words, the direction that they'd like to take A&M and the liberal direction they'd like to take it and make it what it's not.

25:31.302 --> 25:36.887
And I think our balance first is the former students to try to keep the A&M we have.

25:36.927 --> 25:38.229
Now, it's been a lot of changes.

25:38.689 --> 25:39.610
Most have been good.

25:40.130 --> 25:41.892
So I'm concerned about that.

25:42.032 --> 25:47.417
I'm concerned about number two, what is the purpose of Texas A&M?

25:48.038 --> 25:49.039
What's its objective?

25:49.700 --> 25:51.561
In my business, what's my goal?

25:51.641 --> 25:53.783
What am I trying to do here?

25:53.803 --> 25:54.764
What should its goal be?

25:54.864 --> 25:59.689
Its goal should be teaching Texas kids, not furthering careers.

26:00.260 --> 26:08.211
I have very little concern about how many Nobel laureates that we have that you can put on and try to get some ranking somewhere.

26:08.231 --> 26:11.877
I'm different than some people, but I think most Aggies agree with me.

26:12.337 --> 26:13.539
What's the basic purpose?

26:13.599 --> 26:18.426
And the purpose is to teach Texas kids like I was taught, not to further a career.

26:19.287 --> 26:27.499
And I was six years there, going to the, you know the world I'm talking about, and I've never seen so much jealousy.

26:28.019 --> 26:31.224
As academia puts out, I was very disappointed in that.

26:31.946 --> 26:43.926
And I haven't seen as much nurturing of the kids compared to, I'm a professional teacher, next year I'm going to move to so-and-so, move to so-and-so there.

26:44.066 --> 26:45.869
And that's what we had.

26:46.290 --> 26:50.858
So an Aggie like me, I'd like the kids of today to have what I had.

26:50.958 --> 26:52.120
It's probably unrealistic.

26:53.315 --> 26:55.218
But I see that as somewhat of a flaw.

26:55.298 --> 26:55.999
I see the third.

26:56.299 --> 27:04.792
I've had so many of my children's kids come and say, in my lecture, it's some Korean guy who said, I don't understand what he's taking.

27:04.812 --> 27:08.397
So I'm taking math at Blinn and some of those things.

27:08.457 --> 27:10.340
And I see that's down the line.

27:10.360 --> 27:11.882
But I could go on a good while.

27:12.744 --> 27:14.707
How large should the enrollment be at A&M?

27:15.368 --> 27:16.369
I think it's got to grow.

27:17.345 --> 27:18.907
Bigger than the 43,000?

27:19.087 --> 27:19.328
Yes.

27:20.269 --> 27:29.842
And the reason I think so is that the opportunity that we Aggies are so proud of, and we're so proud of being Aggies, should be offered to as many as we could.

27:32.665 --> 27:43.099
And why not have it there rather than at sub-colleges where they could feel like they're really Aggies instead of not being Aggies at Canyon or Kingsville or somewhere like that?

27:44.007 --> 27:45.791
So there's a number of things.

27:45.932 --> 27:54.372
I think there's probably what it takes to have a winning football team is more important than academia thinks because that's where we express our love for A&M.

27:56.984 --> 27:59.928
That's a fair start, how much more you want.

28:00.689 --> 28:01.790
As much as you want to share.

28:02.090 --> 28:02.190
Yeah.

28:02.211 --> 28:04.213
I think those are very critical things.

28:04.734 --> 28:11.863
And so you get down to some points, and this has to be involved and settled almost politically, but what do you want A&M to be?

28:12.864 --> 28:14.125
What does A&M to be?

28:14.586 --> 28:17.730
We have this deal 2000, and they asked me to be on.

28:17.750 --> 28:21.034
I agreed to it, and then there was nothing about the Corps.

28:21.723 --> 28:27.113
I said, well, I'm dropping off of this until you can say that the Corps is important to A&M.

28:27.373 --> 28:33.284
If you want my name and my money, then I'm not going to subscribe to the 2020 as it's here.

28:33.404 --> 28:35.408
And I haven't heard any more from them.

28:35.428 --> 28:36.129
I probably will.

28:37.772 --> 28:38.473
I probably will.

28:38.513 --> 28:39.355
But I think they're wrong.

28:39.395 --> 28:44.524
I think the Corps needs to be, if we're going to have that Corps, C-O-R-E,

28:44.909 --> 28:47.878
You've got to continue to nurture that core because it's not fun.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.749
It's tough, and you've got to do things to keep that going.

28:51.769 --> 28:54.497
It needs support from academia as well.

28:56.536 --> 29:18.477
uh i've got only one more question that i can think of can you i've got this one guy waiting then i can come back all right well i'm not in a hurry oh okay what i've got is a sheriff we're giving them some armored vests for a couple of guys we're gonna get our picture made and why don't you let me go do that all right or if you just have one more we could all right i've got time

29:19.958 --> 29:26.827
Then the last question is, what feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M?

29:27.388 --> 29:35.139
Well, maybe I can best describe those that every time they play the Aggie spirit, I cry.

29:37.101 --> 29:39.785
And like most Aggies, you got kids there.

29:40.085 --> 29:42.248
It's a continuity that we're all proud of.

29:42.909 --> 29:45.713
It's a lineage back from my dad to me to my kids.

29:46.165 --> 29:49.530
Gosh, we've got some that have been five generations now, I guess, you know.

29:50.872 --> 29:54.537
It goes back to the whole, the whole.

29:56.480 --> 30:02.329
The core, the new kids, the whole thing to make a whole.

30:02.569 --> 30:12.223
And maybe best illustrated by the attitude of the state toward A&M at the tragedy of the bonfire.

30:13.283 --> 30:16.707
More importantly, how the A&M kids handled that.

30:18.970 --> 30:31.306
I just have never been more proud of A&M outside of the combat heroes or something than how they handled the bonfire, how the kids, the university has all handled.

30:31.326 --> 30:32.428
And not a lawsuit yet.

30:33.369 --> 30:35.191
Now that's unbelievable.

30:35.211 --> 30:39.477
That's a statement that probably, and of course they said, my kid died there.

30:39.862 --> 30:43.687
Damned if I'm going to have some lawyer trying to get money out of what he gave his life for.

30:44.407 --> 30:47.932
But I'll bet you that wouldn't have happened at lots of other schools.

30:48.032 --> 30:49.734
So how do you define that?

30:49.814 --> 30:50.295
How do you?

30:50.435 --> 30:51.035
I don't know.

30:51.776 --> 30:55.601
But that's the spirit, and it goes back to the core in the middle.

30:55.621 --> 30:56.001
Well, let's see.

30:56.021 --> 30:57.984
Now that caused me then to think of another question.

30:59.005 --> 31:03.150
In all of your Aggie experiences, what are the proudest moments?

31:03.631 --> 31:04.772
Distinguished alumni.

31:05.866 --> 31:09.822
Yeah, I think so, without question.

31:09.902 --> 31:11.067
Yeah, without question.

31:11.810 --> 31:14.982
But I've enjoyed so many proud moments.
