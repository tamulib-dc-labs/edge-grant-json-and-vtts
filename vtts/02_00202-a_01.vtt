AB, AB, 1, 2, 3, testing, AB.

00:11.743 --> 00:14.586
DE, DE, DE, testing, testing. My voice is not very 
good. 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4. This

00:23.697 --> 00:25.780
is July 13th. We're in room 207 of the Evans 
Library, and I have the pleasure and honor of

00:26.500 --> 00:32.788
chatting with Jane Thompson. colleague a long 
time ago. I have the pleasure of recording her

00:37.364 --> 00:45.938
memories of being here on the staff a long, long 
time. Describe growing up and

00:47.020 --> 00:56.295
your mother's work here. I actually feel like I 
grew up on A&M campus because I frequented often

00:56.731 --> 01:04.385
when my mother had to work on Saturdays. I came out 
and worked or played or whatever was available for

01:05.026 --> 01:13.221
quite a long time. I have some fond memories of 
those days when I used to play in the

01:13.471 --> 01:27.315
administration building, like it was my home, my 
grand palace, and roller skate through the

01:13.471 --> 01:27.315
academic building where the wooden floors were, 
where the post office was. There were wooden

01:27.355 --> 01:32.303
floors, and the roar of those roller skates was 
wonderful. But I felt like A&M was really my home.

01:38.665 --> 01:40.687
More than Bryan, Texas. It's been good to me. Let's 
see. Let me. There were not, in those years, were

01:44.231 --> 01:49.777
there any classes in the first floor of the 
academic? Or was it pretty well all

01:50.077 --> 01:51.819
administration? It had some classes, 
unfortunately. Perhaps not Saturday classes,

01:56.264 --> 02:00.608
but there were classes, classrooms there. And I 
remember the rotunda had a big glass case that had

02:02.410 --> 02:07.035
an owl in it. in the middle, and that was a big 
feature to go and show everybody when they

02:07.994 --> 02:11.880
visited. Let's

02:11.920 --> 02:21.676
see, your mom's task in those days, what was she 
doing? My mother worked in several different

02:21.716 --> 02:25.302
places. The one I remember the most was academic, 
student activities, excuse me. student

02:33.037 --> 02:43.831
activities where I got to meet all the good looking 
officers of the Corps that came in to get their

02:33.037 --> 02:43.831
checks and visit and all their plans were made 
there. So I remember some of those very well.

02:50.399 --> 02:53.683
That pretty much sums up what I can, well, no. I 
worked, I mean, when I was in junior high school, we

02:58.670 --> 03:05.657
were recruited to come to the campus for the 
stadium for the film, We've Never Been Licked.

03:05.677 --> 03:06.498
Talk about that. Describe it. They gave us a sack 
lunch, and we were bussed out to the campus. They

03:12.784 --> 03:18.530
gave us a sack lunch, and we got to sit in the stands 
while they filmed the football scenes of that

03:12.784 --> 03:18.530
movie. That's all I know about it. That's pretty 
much all there was. Do you remember seeing Robert

03:22.294 --> 03:25.137
Mitchum or any of the other stars? We got to see the 
stars. It was just a day away from school and we had

03:28.572 --> 03:32.177
fun doing it. But that goes way back.

03:37.405 --> 03:45.097
I used to work in the summers for Ray Perryman for 
the registrar's office when they were testing

03:37.405 --> 03:45.097
freshmen. That was quite several days of testing 
of the freshmen coming in so they could evaluate

03:46.519 --> 03:55.372
their

03:46.519 --> 03:55.372
curriculum. And what kind of work were you doing? 
Oh, we were handing out the test papers and picking

03:58.188 --> 04:07.081
them up and whatever had to be done, monitoring 
them. But Mr. Perriman was a dear man. And in the

04:10.346 --> 04:24.887
beginning, he used to call on me over the 
loudspeaker at Speesa Hall because my name was the

04:10.346 --> 04:24.887
only name he could remember of all the students 
that worked for him, or all the summer students,

04:10.346 --> 04:24.887
because he was familiar with my mother. So I got to 
work special for Mr. Perriman and worked for him in

04:25.795 --> 04:32.442
the summers later until I went to college. Now, did 
he report to Mr. Heaton? Yes. He was, I think,

04:37.106 --> 04:39.208
assistant registrar. But he did the statistical 
work for the registrar's office. Would this have

04:44.814 --> 04:46.776
been an all-day Saturday job? Yes. It was all day. 
Do you remember what the pay was? Oh, no. I have no

04:52.201 --> 04:53.322
idea. We did get paid, though. And in those years, 
when your mom came to the campus, did she come in her

04:56.552 --> 05:03.742
own car or ride with somebody? They usually shared 
a ride with... However, when my mother first

05:07.126 --> 05:18.641
worked for the university, before I was born, 
before she was married, she used to ride to the

05:07.126 --> 05:18.641
campus in the trolley from Bryan. She lived in a 
boarding house in Bryan, and she got the trolley to

05:19.142 --> 05:22.045
work. And...

05:26.123 --> 05:31.750
Okay, then you're doing that. You finished high 
school. Finished high school, and I went to

05:33.613 --> 05:50.494
college at Sam Houston, and during the second 
summer term, I came down with infectious

05:33.613 --> 05:50.494
mononucleosis and had to drop out of school, and 
ended up getting married the following February,

05:51.689 --> 05:56.774
so, to my biology professor. So that pretty much 
ended my college career.

06:03.382 --> 06:06.685
And then come back to Bryan when? I mean, back to 
Bryan College Station when? I came back to Bryan

06:09.388 --> 06:11.771
College Station in 1964. And it was my idea, of 
course, to get a job on the campus, which is where I

06:13.913 --> 06:20.380
felt at home. And my mother had told me there was a 
job opening in the office of the graduate college.

06:27.288 --> 06:32.256
And she felt like at that time that it was beginning 
to grow, the graduate programs were going to grow.

06:32.316 --> 06:36.003
And she thought that might be a good place for me to 
work or start to work. And I interviewed there, got

06:36.984 --> 06:41.592
the job, and I stayed there for 25 years. Describe 
the interview as well as you remember it. Oh, Ms.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.759
Watson, Ms. Doris Watson. Bless her heart, she was 
the typical administrative old maid secretary,

06:49.240 --> 06:56.227
if you want to call it that. Bless her heart. She 
wore glasses on the end of her nose. And of course,

07:00.491 --> 07:09.621
she knew my mother too, and I have to say that helped 
me a great deal because I think they respected her

07:00.491 --> 07:09.621
and they treated me with respect. So she did hire 
me. I had not worked in an office all those years I

07:11.736 --> 07:19.768
was married, and I had to essentially start all 
over again. But it was interesting work. As far as

07:24.455 --> 07:28.320
you knew when you went to work, what were your 
duties going to be? More or less, I was a

07:28.440 --> 07:32.707
receptionist, so it was perfectly harmless, 
almost. I had to answer the phone and write on

07:34.029 --> 07:37.974
people and mail out. And of course, we typed. To the 
graduating doctorate students, we typed

07:40.499 --> 07:47.169
original letters to each student. They had to be 
perfect. So I had a lot of practice typing letters.

07:54.440 --> 07:59.227
That was before the... What kind of machine were 
you using then to type those letters? It was an

08:00.709 --> 08:02.351
electric machine. It was? Oh, okay. Yeah, it was 
the first ones. But you still had to erase

08:06.477 --> 08:08.781
typographical letters? Oh, we had to, yes. fact we 
weren't allowed to erase unless they just

08:09.912 --> 08:38.063
positively couldn't see it but she inspected each 
and every letter which she should have but I

08:09.912 --> 08:38.063
enjoyed working there and when I first remember 
working there I think we had all of four filing

08:09.912 --> 08:38.063
cabinets that the graduate applications were 
filed and I think in 89 when I retired, there were at

08:38.752 --> 08:46.703
least, oh, there had to be a hundred file cabinets, 
active and inactive students. Describe what

08:46.723 --> 08:54.954
offices, when you went to work, describe what 
offices, what officials were in the Koch

08:46.723 --> 08:54.954
building. The president was just across the hall, 
and the academic vice president for research, I

08:55.694 --> 09:04.086
believe, was with him. I've been trying to think of 
his name. I can't right now. But that was pretty

09:12.221 --> 09:13.223
much all. The registrar's office was in one side of 
Coke Billy. The fiscal office was on the other,

09:15.887 --> 09:25.320
which for graduate programs was perfect because 
we could run down there and do whatever we needed to

09:15.887 --> 09:25.320
do with no problems. That was an ideal situation. 
And the registrar was down? It was in the Coke

09:30.788 --> 09:32.551
Billy. On the first floor. On the first floor. The 
fiscal office had one half and the registrar had

09:34.113 --> 09:37.598
the other half. So it was a nice situation. 
Describe those people that Earl Rutter was the

09:42.173 --> 09:48.261
president. Describe Earl Rutter from your point 
of view.

09:53.547 --> 10:08.445
I had very little contact with President Rutter, 
but I know that we had a great deal of respect for him

09:53.547 --> 10:08.445
and thought that he was a great leader, which we 
needed. And he absolutely, when I was working for

10:09.100 --> 10:20.916
Dr. Coons, he let us do what we had to do without any 
interference at all. And President Rutter's

10:21.557 --> 10:25.563
primary secretary was who? Was Nelda Rowell. And 
now Nelda Green. Nelda Green. Describe her as...

10:32.434 --> 10:37.538
Oh, a lovely, lovely lady, and she still is and 
always will be. A really special person. I was

10:40.181 --> 10:49.149
friends with all of the administrative 
secretaries on the campus, the secretaries to the

10:40.181 --> 10:49.149
deans, because we belonged to the National 
Secretary Association. We had Bosses Night and

10:49.649 --> 10:52.391
all the good things. We got very close. We knew we 
could depend on each other, and we did, from time to

10:53.953 --> 10:59.037
time, call and ask for... Can you do this? Or will 
you tell me that? So we worked very well together,

11:03.391 --> 11:07.455
and we had a lot of respect for each other. I'm not 
going to ask you the negative now. Among those key

11:09.878 --> 11:15.604
secretaries, who were your favorites, your 
closest colleagues? I'd have to think about that.

11:18.587 --> 11:21.290
Because I really, in the graduate office, we 
worked with all the deans. So I really, I suppose

11:22.311 --> 11:27.977
Nelda was my favorite top secretary. But Margaret 
Coleman in the engineering, wonderful person.

11:33.641 --> 11:39.449
Amadele

11:33.641 --> 11:39.449
Backus in veterinary medicine. I can't think 
of... And in that era there were only the deans of

11:41.752 --> 11:49.884
arts and sciences, agriculture, engineering, 
and veterinary medicine. Peggy Ritchie of course

11:51.767 --> 11:55.933
is one of my favorite people and we shared an office 
at one time. She worked for one of the deans and we in

11:58.619 --> 11:59.800
the Koch building. She was part of the office, so I 
got to know her very well, and she is a special

12:00.521 --> 12:05.788
person to me, too. I do want to mention one of the 
jobs I had in the early years in the graduate

12:06.269 --> 12:11.936
office. We had to take in all the thesis and 
dissertations over the desk. We had to check them.

12:22.329 --> 12:23.590
We had to count the pages. We had to measure the 
margins. Now, one of the only jobs I ever

12:26.918 --> 12:34.571
complained about that I can remember is checking 
thesis and dissertations. I would do anything but

12:36.374 --> 12:39.839
have to do that. So they gave me the job of when they 
came back from the bindery and they could submit as

12:40.140 --> 12:53.702
many copies as they wanted to pay six dollars for, I 
think it was, they could submit ten copies if they

12:40.140 --> 12:53.702
wanted to, but I had to ship all those extra copies 
out to wherever they were. So that was my penalty

12:57.348 --> 13:01.454
for not checking these dissertations. As far as 
you know, whose idea was it to check those details?

13:06.661 --> 13:08.063
Was that Dean Kunze's? No, that went way back 
before Dean Kunze. Dean Kunze is the one that

13:10.847 --> 13:14.372
wanted the thesis clerk in the library. Thank 
goodness for that. Now you went to work in what

13:17.307 --> 13:20.110
year? 64. All right. Now Kunze was not yet the 
graduate. No, he was not, and I'm sorry, I can't

13:24.254 --> 13:36.007
remember what year he came in, but see, Barczak was 
the associate dean, and then when they made a dean,

13:24.254 --> 13:36.007
they put Dean Kunze in as dean. There was never 
another dean. Wayne Hall was the vice president

13:37.609 --> 13:40.432
for academic affairs and... The graduate 
college, yeah. Describe Wayne Hall. A quiet, very

13:44.780 --> 13:46.983
mannerly man. Mrs. Watson did not let us have much 
communication with Dr. Hall. She protected him

13:56.134 --> 13:58.998
very well, but he was always very nice. Actually, I 
had just almost nothing to do with him. What kind of

14:04.785 --> 14:06.467
hours did he work? I have no idea, because we were 
segregated so from him that I didn't see him come in

14:08.219 --> 14:16.130
and I didn't see him leave. We were in one half of 
that office, do you remember? And he was in the

14:19.475 --> 14:20.577
other half. And the only way the deans could see 
him, or associate deans, assistant deans, would

14:21.518 --> 14:34.617
sneak around the back of that office in the Koch 
building through the back side of it that was away

14:21.518 --> 14:34.617
from Mrs. Watson. As far as you were aware, Earl 
Rudder was a key decision maker. Who else were key

14:40.824 --> 14:43.808
decision makers at A&M then? Do you have any? No, 
I'm sorry, I can't. My world was the graduate

14:48.293 --> 15:01.110
office and I think the deans had a great deal of 
input to whatever was, it wasn't quite as

14:48.293 --> 15:01.110
complicated as it is now because there was the, the 
structure was a lot simpler then. So the deans had a

15:01.711 --> 15:03.854
lot of input into what. And normally your working 
hours were? Eight to five. But didn't you

15:08.007 --> 15:09.569
sometimes work? Oh, well, as I went up the ladder in 
the office, my hours got longer and longer, but it

15:10.150 --> 15:20.946
was something I enjoyed doing. The only problem is 
I had to certify graduating students' degrees

15:20.986 --> 15:33.525
three times a year every year, along with 
everything else that I had to do, and that got to be

15:20.986 --> 15:33.525
quite difficult. Tiresome, to say the least. Do 
you remember any crisis events about somebody

15:36.309 --> 15:43.299
doing something at the last minute? Oh, we always 
had that. That was pretty normal. But I can

15:46.683 --> 15:57.258
remember when we had to submit a signed list of 
graduating students by a deadline, so many

15:46.683 --> 15:57.258
copies. And in those days, the only copier we had 
was the mimeograph. And the only mimeograph

16:02.395 --> 16:05.700
machine we had was in the president's office. So we 
had to troop over there, and I was never one that was

16:06.681 --> 16:14.052
good at mimeographing. It just never seemed to go 
right for me. But anyway, we finally got a

16:15.814 --> 16:23.646
multilift operator in the fiscal office, and he 
used to run my list for me at the last minute.

16:26.570 --> 16:28.393
But that was my most trauma. We had those deadlines 
to meet. Do you remember any time when, if anybody,

16:30.458 --> 16:41.598
a regent or a administrator or a parent tried to get 
y'all to make an exception to the rule? No. I

16:42.439 --> 16:45.765
truthfully cannot remember anything like that. 
Especially when Dr. Kunze is dean, everything was

16:45.785 --> 16:51.555
completely above board. he would have been the 
last person to ever let anything happen that he

16:52.210 --> 16:58.777
might embarrass himself or the college or 
anybody. So we did the best job we could to make it

16:58.817 --> 17:06.105
as, I'm not saying that we didn't make mistakes 
occasionally. I did graduate somebody who wasn't

17:06.125 --> 17:08.868
cleared one time. But that was purely a clerical 
error. This is an editorial note to the typist and

17:14.313 --> 17:18.758
to be identified as an editorial note. I was 
invited to join this staff as assistant dean of the

17:19.598 --> 17:29.469
graduate school or assistant graduate dean or 
whatever it might be. R.W. Bill Barzak from the

17:32.713 --> 17:39.861
English department was the associate dean and 
Wayne Hall was vice president and graduate dean.

17:41.503 --> 17:44.526
Then after a year or so, Bill Barzac told me that he 
was going to go back to the English department,

17:45.147 --> 18:10.260
that he thought that Vice President Hall might ask 
me about moving up, and he did, ask me if I was

17:45.147 --> 18:10.260
interested, but it would be a full-time task, and I 
had been doing half-time and teaching and enjoyed

17:45.147 --> 18:10.260
that, and he said, no, it would have to be 
full-time, and I told him, well, I probably then

17:45.147 --> 18:10.260
would not be interested, but I also asked him, how 
long might it be before they selected a graduate

18:11.017 --> 18:16.924
dean? And he said that he thought that would 
probably be done within a year. I then paused and

18:22.772 --> 18:31.042
asked him, would anyone from the liberal arts area 
have any chance to be considered? He smiled and

18:32.063 --> 18:39.032
then said very confidently, we've already 
decided it's going to be someone from

18:32.063 --> 18:39.032
agriculture. So I told him, no, I'd go on back, but I 
would stay to help that person get started. And

18:46.463 --> 18:57.901
then so I worked with Dean George Kunze for a year 
and enjoyed that and found him to be a splendid

18:46.463 --> 18:57.901
person to work with. Okay, end of note. When Dr. 
Kunze came in, do you remember how he organized the

19:06.670 --> 19:09.074
Did you become the senior person? No. He had to use 
Mrs. Watson. So, she still was the supervisor of

19:12.739 --> 19:21.953
all of the support staff for graduate and academic 
VP. Eventually, I mean it didn't take long that he

19:22.314 --> 19:31.007
couldn't live with that situation, so I did become 
his secretary.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.564
but it was a little bit after that. Make believe 
I've never seen George Kunze. Describe him

19:39.049 --> 19:41.292
physically, his appearance. George

19:41.333 --> 19:53.113
Kunze, I believe, probably came from the same part 
of Germany as the Pope.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.969
in Italy. They're built, they look the same build, 
same features almost as the pope in Italy.

20:08.364 --> 20:09.466
Always pleasant man. He would hit the door in the 
morning with his sack lunch heading for the

20:09.526 --> 20:21.801
refrigerator and speak to everybody in the office 
good morning. I didn't realize how important that

20:22.861 --> 20:27.325
was until he was gone and nobody ever did it again. 
But he was just that kind of man. And when something

20:29.907 --> 20:33.490
went wrong, he absolutely dropped everything. He 
sat there like he had the rest of the day to spend

20:33.530 --> 20:38.234
with you and you would talk about it. I didn't 
really appreciate him until he was gone as much as I

20:39.636 --> 20:43.980
should have. But there's not many like that. Did 
you learn any pet peeves that he had? Was there

20:51.785 --> 20:55.492
anything that he really didn't want anybody to do? 
Oh, yes. The main thing was we were in the Koch

20:58.557 --> 21:14.265
building on the second floor, had a lovely lounge 
outside between

20:58.557 --> 21:14.265
the offices, and he did not want the girls sitting 
out there doing handwork or anything like that. He

21:15.612 --> 21:20.860
felt like anybody visiting the university would 
think that that was foolish, wasting time. So the

21:21.761 --> 21:26.909
girls, they just didn't even try. But he didn't 
want anybody reading at their desk, and he didn't

21:26.969 --> 21:32.878
want anybody sitting looking like they had 
nothing to do. Of course, we never did have that

21:33.860 --> 21:36.303
freedom. And in that era, the support staff never 
smoked. Oh, no. No, no. We never had any smoking in

21:42.843 --> 21:45.167
our office. Never even came up. And what was 
appropriate dress? Well, appropriate dress in

21:51.179 --> 21:59.195
the beginning was just your nice looking clothes 
like you would wear to church, perhaps. Hose, of

22:01.039 --> 22:03.203
course, always. But then there came a time when 
they were talking about pantsuits, so everybody

22:04.246 --> 22:22.833
wanted, that was the latest thing, and so we had a 
meeting, and he agreed that we could wear

22:04.246 --> 22:22.833
pantsuits if they were coordinated, and of course 
that was what everybody was wearing, and that was

22:04.246 --> 22:22.833
the most liberal thing we did. How did y'all plan 
that meeting to bring that up? Well, it just takes

22:29.407 --> 22:31.609
two or three girls. The office wasn't that large at 
that time, so there weren't that many people in

22:31.649 --> 22:36.654
there, as you well know. So it just took a couple of 
us to go to him, and he was open for suggestions. He

22:42.040 --> 22:43.461
was always willing to listen. He didn't always 
agree with us, but he was willing to listen. I do

22:47.325 --> 22:59.177
want to say one thing I remember especially during 
those times was when you would come in the middle of

22:47.325 --> 22:59.177
the office and do your radio impersonations. And 
Mrs. Watson glaring at you with her glasses. But we

23:03.521 --> 23:07.306
enjoyed that so much and had such fun laughing 
about it. And

23:07.326 --> 23:29.029
do you remember any great crises, big problems 
that...

23:07.326 --> 23:29.029
We had a lot of crises, but they were just taken care 
of as a matter of

23:30.376 --> 23:33.722
I don't think we ever had anything get out of hand 
that I can remember. Now this was the time when

23:34.343 --> 23:37.689
women were first attending. Do you remember any 
problems that the graduate college had over

23:38.711 --> 23:44.260
co-education or racial integration? No. We 
really had, we actually just dealt with everybody

23:45.643 --> 23:53.076
the same. I must say that I felt a little uneasy when 
the Iran crisis and those times when we had so many

23:53.309 --> 24:00.818
Iranian students. And I just simply wasn't sure 
what would happen when you walk up to the window and

24:01.879 --> 24:08.247
be talking to someone. And also mail bombs were a 
hot issue then. But we didn't talk about it. We

24:14.894 --> 24:15.795
didn't dwell on it. We just handled things as we 
always had and tried not to make it an issue. Where

24:20.201 --> 24:23.164
did you and your colleagues where did y'all eat 
lunch in that era in the office usually we have a

24:23.482 --> 24:45.372
microwave we had when we moved over to the Teague 
building we had our refrigerator we shared a

24:23.482 --> 24:45.372
kitchen area with the Xerox with the College of 
Medicine so we had the lap of luxury there we had a

24:23.482 --> 24:45.372
microwave and we had a refrigerator and We really 
just didn't go out a lot unless someone had to go

24:45.622 --> 24:49.146
home. But eating out was not, maybe on Friday we 
would go out and eat together somewhere. And back

24:54.632 --> 25:04.504
in the Koch building and also the Teague building, 
y'all did not take breaks mid-morning and

24:54.632 --> 25:04.504
mid-afternoon, did you? And walk over to the MSC or 
anything like that? No, we never got out of the

25:07.647 --> 25:11.051
building until quitting time. But I do remember we 
used to go on Friday together, we would go It was in

25:15.760 --> 25:17.262
the Coke building. It was with Peggy Anderson and 
some others I remember. It was the Coke building.

25:21.268 --> 25:28.860
We used to go to the Texan for lunch, which we would 
get, for a dollar and a quarter, we got chicken

25:21.268 --> 25:28.860
fried steak, mashed potatoes, and a salad.

25:31.544 --> 25:34.107
And it was the Texan, the one that... It was the 
drive-in then.

25:41.118 --> 25:41.839
It was a restaurant. We ate inside in the 
restaurant. Now, as a sidelight, during that era,

25:45.460 --> 25:53.611
where were the classiest places to eat in Bryan 
College Station? I don't think we had any.

25:59.540 --> 26:01.222
Let's see if I can remember the name. The 
Captain's, there was a restaurant called the

26:01.763 --> 26:06.049
Captain's Table.

26:10.595 --> 26:14.100
And of course, always the Mexican food places.

26:15.380 --> 26:16.722
I'd have to really think about that. Another 
example of how times change, where did you park as

26:17.663 --> 26:22.229
an employee? Well, in the Koch building, I had my 
own reserve parking place. Eventually, I

26:25.994 --> 26:28.157
graduated to that. Immediately next door? 
Immediately next door, and it was lovely, just

26:29.538 --> 26:33.223
lovely. And then we moved to the Teague building. 
We had to park across the street in Lot 55, which was

26:36.287 --> 26:43.537
okay. But I did miss that. adjacent parking. It was 
nice. I loved looking out at my window in the Koch

26:50.794 --> 26:54.779
Building onto Military Walk. Because I have 
really pleasant memories of when my mother and I

26:56.100 --> 27:06.313
used to come out and park and watch the students 
march down Military Walk from Guyon Hall to Sevesa

26:56.100 --> 27:06.313
through there. Describe the attitude of the 
students in general and what this campus was like

27:07.134 --> 27:14.783
in the 60s.

27:17.243 --> 27:22.772
I had no problem. We didn't see that many students. 
Now remember, we didn't see the colleges pretty

27:24.395 --> 27:31.727
much, and we worked through their advisors and 
their deans. So as far as interaction with

27:31.848 --> 27:42.205
students, except in the summer when we worked with 
registration, when we had to approve all the

27:31.848 --> 27:42.205
graduate registrations in the summer, we didn't 
really get into the students' activities. But

27:47.095 --> 27:48.277
were students polite? Yes, it was their dress that 
was always so entertaining, so to speak, because

27:49.458 --> 28:03.137
they were various forms of dress and undress 
during the summer. In those years, they were

28:03.197 --> 28:10.808
wearing the low-cut jeans and the hairdos and 
really some Interesting thing, and we enjoyed

28:11.260 --> 28:13.162
that. But were there ever any student troubles? 
No, there were not. And people from Washington

28:17.968 --> 28:33.047
would visit the campus, for instance, with Dr. 
Kunze, and they would just remark what a quiet,

28:17.968 --> 28:33.047
well-behaved student body. There were no 
outrageous-looking people. It was... they were

28:38.294 --> 28:46.586
just impressed with the way it was performing at 
that time because they were having so many

28:38.294 --> 28:46.586
problems in other colleges. And was the graduate 
college growing? The graduate college was

28:51.833 --> 29:05.753
growing and growing and growing and Dr. Kunze 
fortunately had the foresight to go to the

28:51.833 --> 29:05.753
automated graduate student record system of 
which he And the data processing center worked out

29:07.606 --> 29:15.918
a program which saved us in the long run, because we 
could never have handled all those records

29:07.606 --> 29:15.918
without it. It was very popular. He traveled over 
the countryside, especially to the colleges of

29:18.662 --> 29:27.395
the Council of Graduate Schools, and gave talks on 
that program. I don't know how many of them adopted

29:27.656 --> 29:35.267
it, but they did visit to see what we were doing, how 
we were doing it.

29:37.357 --> 29:38.218
Quite a breakthrough. Did you and your friends 
think that A&M was making progress during those

29:38.258 --> 29:44.347
years? Were we getting better and bigger? Yes, 
because I would see the correspondents coming in

29:46.631 --> 29:59.369
from other schools and deans and places he visited 
saying the nice things about our programs and with

29:46.631 --> 29:59.369
great respect. So I really realized we were 
getting bigger, and I was most proud of it. Now,

30:05.251 --> 30:10.336
President Rutter's office was moved from the Koch 
Building to the System Building. Yes. Well,

30:12.078 --> 30:14.020
actually, they were in the Teague Building. No, 
no, I know this before, before, while Rutter was

30:14.421 --> 30:20.427
still president. He was in the System Building, 
wasn't he? Yes. From the System Building, I guess

30:23.330 --> 30:26.974
they moved to the Teague Building and then to the 
Koch Building. Because we, we got their offices in

30:31.070 --> 30:35.437
the Teague building, the president's office in 
the Teague building when we moved there. They had

30:35.457 --> 30:38.882
been there and they wanted back in the Koch 
building. Yeah. So you weren't aware that Mr.

30:41.787 --> 30:45.112
Rutter's health was failing? No. In the late, or? I 
wasn't, no. I'm not sure whether. Do you remember

30:48.798 --> 30:52.664
the reaction of the campus when Mr. Rutter died? 
Oh, yes. It was a shock to all of us. We felt it. Did

30:58.835 --> 30:59.656
you go to the memorial? I did. I went to the 
memorial. I went to, um, what do you call it?

31:09.689 --> 31:11.772
What the students, the ceremony the students. Oh, 
oh, I mean, uh, uh, uh, Silver Taps. Yeah. Silver

31:15.177 --> 31:15.778
Taps. Yes, yes. Um, but we all did. We all 
participated, and it was, um, And Nelda was so, she

31:24.209 --> 31:28.532
was so,
