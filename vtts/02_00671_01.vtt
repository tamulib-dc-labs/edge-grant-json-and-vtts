00:01.246 --> 00:05.531
November the 4th, and I am talking to Dr. Chris. 
Today is November the 4th. I'm visiting with Dr.

00:08.375 --> 00:14.862
Chris Borman, who's the associate dean for the 
College of Education and has been at Texas A&M

00:08.375 --> 00:14.862
since 1960? 1970. 1970, which was a year after the 
College of Education became a college. And Chris,

00:23.633 --> 00:31.202
one of the things that I think I would like your 
perceptions on, and again, It's strictly your own

00:31.486 --> 00:37.092
feelings and where you've been, and you've been 
department head, professor, and now as dean.

00:37.492 --> 00:41.396
You've seen this college evolve from the very 
beginning, and you've seen a lot of changes. And

00:41.937 --> 00:46.482
what I would like is how you have perceived these 
changes. What were the things that affected it or

00:46.542 --> 00:54.590
impacted the tremendous growth of the College of 
Education since your arrival in 1970? Let's see.

01:00.224 --> 01:01.045
I don't know. These aren't in order of importance. 
I would say the first thing is the university in

01:03.589 --> 01:13.602
1970, everybody knows this, but it was probably 
about 13,000 students. And I don't think anybody,

01:14.884 --> 01:25.338
certainly I didn't have the idea that I was taking a 
position at a university that was going to grow so

01:14.884 --> 01:25.338
rapidly. And this was the first college position, 
the only college position I've had. Who recruited

01:30.905 --> 01:33.228
you? Art Roach, Dr. Arthur Roach, who was at the 
time head of the Department of Educational

01:34.089 --> 01:40.879
Psychology. And he recruited me. He had gone to a 
summer seminar at Indiana University that was

01:46.346 --> 01:56.961
being led by my chair up there. They were looking 
for somebody who had experience in vocational

01:57.380 --> 02:07.854
education and was in counseling, because they had 
a grant from the Texas Education Agency to train

01:57.380 --> 02:07.854
vocational counselors. So they needed somebody 
who had this background in vocational education,

02:07.874 --> 02:21.953
and I had worked at a vocational high school in 
Hammond, Indiana for a lot of years, so I had that

02:07.874 --> 02:21.953
experience. He started calling around and he 
called my chair at Indiana and he told me about it.

02:29.027 --> 02:48.413
The thing that's kind of interesting I think is 
about two or three months, a couple months ahead of

02:29.027 --> 02:48.413
that, I'd been at the APGA, which is the National 
Counselors Association meeting in New Orleans

02:29.027 --> 02:48.413
and they have a job bank or interview type thing and 
I had just really worked real hard and had maybe 13

02:50.097 --> 03:03.051
to 15 interviews and met all these different 
people and Dr. Roach and several faculty members

02:50.097 --> 03:03.051
were there interviewing for this job and I never 
met them at all. And then I get back to Indiana and he

03:04.192 --> 03:09.538
calls me so I came down here. But anyway, I would say 
that the tremendous growth of the university, I

03:09.558 --> 03:19.108
certainly didn't have any idea that the 
university that I was taking a job at would go The

03:19.628 --> 03:27.415
other thing that's kind of interesting is the job 
that I took was a one-year temporary job, and I'm

03:19.628 --> 03:27.415
still there. Was it soft money? It was soft money. 
It was soft money. They had a grant from the Texas

03:32.359 --> 03:37.123
Education Agency, and it was soft money. And they 
couldn't guarantee absolutely, but Dean Hubert

03:38.224 --> 03:49.433
told me, he said that he would pretty much give his 
word that they would make it a permanent position,

03:38.224 --> 03:49.433
which they did the next year. But so that... Was 
there very much going on with soft money at the

03:49.801 --> 03:55.149
time? Because I have heard that, you know, he 
really preferred not to put too much emphasis on

03:55.209 --> 04:03.440
soft money type programs. He wanted to have the 
hard... Well, I think he wanted to have the hard

04:03.460 --> 04:11.892
line position, but he was very much in favor of 
getting external funding. Okay. And he,

04:12.694 --> 04:19.403
especially at that time, vocational education 
money was, there was quite a bit of money available

04:12.694 --> 04:19.403
during the 70s and... Mm-hmm. this money was a part 
of it. So he was very interested in doing that. But

04:24.841 --> 04:31.473
he did give me his word that he would try to make it a 
permanent position next year. And you came into

04:31.493 --> 04:37.465
the Department of Educational Psychology, which 
is where you still are teaching. Right, right. So

04:41.810 --> 04:43.973
the size, the way the university grew. I guess the 
other thing that really amazed me is the way the

04:44.033 --> 04:50.341
physical appearance of the university has 
changed. I mean, you know, just the buildings and

04:50.401 --> 04:53.645
size and everything. We were, you know, my first 
office was up on the fourth floor of Academic, and

04:53.665 --> 05:03.257
we had these big wooden bookcases. I mean, it was a 
classroom that was made into a series of offices,

05:03.398 --> 05:10.787
and just bookcases divided us, you know. We moved 
around several times. We moved over then to Bolton

05:15.214 --> 05:22.023
Hall and had offices up there on the second or third 
floor. And Harrington was a parking lot for

05:23.485 --> 05:30.615
academic at that time. And so it was really 
exciting when they started building Harrington

05:31.596 --> 05:40.588
and then I think we moved in in what, 72 or 73, 
something like that. The physical appearance,

05:40.957 --> 05:49.006
not that I didn't think it was an attractive 
campus, but they had really changed it. Was there a

05:49.126 --> 05:50.428
lot of resistance? I was looking at some yearbooks 
that had pictures and some complaints and

05:50.488 --> 06:00.519
demonstrations by students because they were 
putting in so much concrete and taking off some of

05:50.488 --> 06:00.519
the trees and some of this. A&M has really strived 
to keep the campus, the aesthetic. I think they

06:05.545 --> 06:07.607
have done a pretty good job of doing that. In fact, I 
think they've improved it a lot. But there was a

06:10.792 --> 06:19.103
time there during the 70s, 71, 72, where they just 
tore up the walks and everything, and you couldn't

06:10.792 --> 06:19.103
even, you know, there wasn't any place to walk. I 
remember we were in Bolton, and they just tore up

06:19.203 --> 06:26.873
one afternoon, they just tore up the sidewalk all 
the way, and there was just a trench there. And as

06:28.655 --> 06:33.261
long as it was dry, but then when it rained, it was 
just, I mean, it was horrible. You couldn't even

06:33.281 --> 06:40.731
get up to the steps to get up to the, you know, and 
they didn't seem to have a whole lot of concern for

06:33.281 --> 06:40.731
that, you know, they just, just kinda but what 
they've done I think the other thing that happened

06:40.981 --> 07:08.170
to is when I got there I came there for an interview 
like on a Friday I arrived on a Thursday night and I

06:40.981 --> 07:08.170
was there just for Friday and then I went back 
Friday evening so it was a real quick trip and

06:40.981 --> 07:08.170
between that time and the time that I accepted the 
job and I I started then in the first of June

07:08.555 --> 07:13.582
teaching summer school. And my family was still in 
Indiana because we had a cellar house and all that.

07:17.367 --> 07:20.131
So it was about six weeks before they moved in. I 
started teaching summer school. And at that time

07:21.914 --> 07:23.937
is when General Rudder had died. President Rudder 
had died. So I never was on campus. I think he was ill

07:28.563 --> 07:31.928
in the hospital at the time I was there being 
interviewed. He died in March, I believe. Oh, had

07:33.610 --> 07:34.552
he died in March? Well, no way. Well, he either had 
died or died in that interim right there. But

07:40.884 --> 07:48.811
anyway, then General Ludeke was acting president 
for a year or so. But I think another thing that is

07:48.831 --> 08:02.063
just my perception, and I think it had a 
significant impact on the college and on the

07:48.831 --> 08:02.063
university, was bringing Jack Williams in. Lots 
and lots of changes occurred. during his 70s. And I

08:07.856 --> 08:16.819
think his leadership style and the way he did it is 
he didn't irritate. You were talking about people

08:16.859 --> 08:21.812
being upset because they were tearing up the 
campus and changing things. There are a lot of

08:22.180 --> 08:23.962
significant changes. I mean, if you look at what's 
happened at A&M just since 1970, lots and lots of

08:24.062 --> 08:34.573
changes and it certainly could have upset a lot of 
former students, but I don't think there was a

08:24.062 --> 08:34.573
whole lot of that. I may be naive about this and 
wasn't in on, you know, all the feelings there, but

08:34.714 --> 08:47.007
I think his leadership style and what happened, he 
was the right man for the time.

08:48.117 --> 08:56.885
I think also having a background in history and 
coming from a different background, he added a

08:48.117 --> 08:56.885
flavor to the university that we needed. Also, 
it's my perception that he was extremely well

08:57.265 --> 09:02.009
liked by the faculty. The faculty had lots of 
respect for him. So I think that's a significant

09:09.155 --> 09:10.817
thing. So you have worked then under Williams as 
president. You did not have any experience with

09:13.899 --> 09:16.842
Rutter. Miller and now Vanderbilt. I have not 
really, we have not discussed presidents with any

09:21.833 --> 09:30.830
of the other interviews, but that is definitely a 
part of the external environment, which I will be

09:21.833 --> 09:30.830
looking at. So this is good to get these 
perceptions about the leadership in the

09:31.291 --> 09:37.682
university, because I've been focusing on the 
leadership in the college, but it's important to

09:38.168 --> 09:44.694
get this feeling of what was going on outside of the 
College of Education. And if you can expand that

09:44.714 --> 09:47.516
then to the other two administrations. I would say 
just if I looked at all the administrations, I

09:47.536 --> 09:51.680
would rate his as number one. I mean, maybe I 
shouldn't do that, but I would say I was really

09:51.700 --> 10:07.213
impressed with his leadership style and the 
growth and the way he handled it and some of the

09:51.700 --> 10:07.213
people that he had around him and

09:51.700 --> 10:07.213
everything. I would say that he probably had the 
most respect of any of the, not that the other ones

10:08.881 --> 10:15.251
didn't have as much respect. Miller wasn't in 
there long enough to really get an impact. He was

10:19.838 --> 10:31.996
more, a more traditional approach to, and I think 
that was quite a contrast between Williams and

10:19.838 --> 10:31.996
what had gone on before. I didn't have a And Miller 
was an A&M graduate. Do you think that had any

10:35.562 --> 10:38.225
effect? Oh, yeah, I think it did. I think it had an 
effect in that he was a background in agriculture,

10:40.828 --> 10:46.953
ag economics, and so on. I don't think there's 
anything wrong with supporting all the

10:48.515 --> 11:00.927
traditions and being real strong with that, but I 
think that in terms of being a broad university, I

10:48.515 --> 11:00.927
think that What has been the impact, do you think, 
of Vander? He has been here now for... Well, I think

11:05.238 --> 11:11.848
five or maybe six years. It was in 81, I guess. Yeah, 
okay. Well, he had a couple, their initial first

11:15.514 --> 11:24.348
couple years were pretty rocky, I think. And I've 
been impressed with him. Not that I've met him and

11:29.459 --> 11:31.541
interacted with him that often. But I have 
interacted with him. And I'm impressed with him.

11:36.186 --> 11:38.088
He's a brilliant person. And he makes a real good 
impression for the community or wherever. I mean,

11:46.276 --> 11:48.198
he's quite a scholar. And he's an interesting 
person. I don't think he has a contact with the

11:49.740 --> 11:55.045
faculty that, let's say, Jack Williams did. What 
about, what has he done, in your opinion, to help

11:55.632 --> 12:01.999
the College of Education? Is there anything 
specific that has happened in the College of

12:02.899 --> 12:08.105
Education because of his leadership? Well, I 
think that there are a number of things. For one

12:12.469 --> 12:16.554
thing, and this is university-wide, but I think 
it's had quite an impact. I would say probably one

12:16.614 --> 12:24.762
of the biggest things then, and as I think about it 
now, maybe he's had more contact or impact with the

12:16.614 --> 12:24.762
faculty Maybe I want to retract that statement. 
But he, under his administration, he formed the

12:27.317 --> 12:32.645
Faculty Senate. And there's a lot more faculty 
involvement, a lot more of a democratic process,

12:32.665 --> 12:43.041
and a lot more input from faculty. And I would say 
that's a very strong, very strong point. Is the

12:46.406 --> 12:51.715
faculty as a whole was very receptive to this 
title? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think so. Do they have

12:53.842 --> 12:58.249
these kinds of things in most universities, these 
faculty centers or faculty input? Yes, yes. And

12:59.391 --> 13:08.827
A&M was, you know, more, I guess, because of its 
military background and the way it's emerged,

12:59.391 --> 13:08.827
especially since it's become so large just in the 
more recent years. What is the size of the faculty

13:11.171 --> 13:14.095
now? I'd say it's probably around 2,000. I think 
that's just a rough estimate. What is the total

13:18.303 --> 13:21.406
faculty in the College of Education? Well, I'd say 
about 150, probably about 110 regular faculty

13:21.586 --> 13:30.033
positions, but probably when you count sophomore 
positions and everything else. Okay. So we talked

13:31.294 --> 13:35.498
then a little bit about the things that have 
affected change. To what extent do you feel that

13:36.358 --> 13:47.888
the college, because the mission of the College of 
Education is the same as it is for the university or

13:36.358 --> 13:47.888
the land grant institution, which is teaching and 
research and service, Under the two

13:48.779 --> 14:02.597
administrations in the College of Education, has 
there been a shift in emphasis between these

13:48.779 --> 14:02.597
three, or have they been given equal

13:48.779 --> 14:02.597
priority or whatever? What is your feeling on 
those? I don't see a major shift

14:04.840 --> 14:10.868
there. I don't think that we're as, and probably 
you would find this with a lot of colleges of

14:10.888 --> 14:16.575
education, we're strong on research as let's say a 
college of science or some of the other colleges. I

14:23.373 --> 14:37.732
mean there isn't, it's important and people are 
expected to do research but I would also, you know

14:23.373 --> 14:37.732
some places there's such a strong emphasis on 
research and even though they say teaching is

14:23.373 --> 14:37.732
important it doesn't get as much emphasis. And I 
would say it's probably more equal in our college.

14:42.172 --> 14:50.884
And I have not really seen a big change between the 
Hubert administration or the Corrigan

14:42.172 --> 14:50.884
administration in terms of emphasis. Would you 
rate, is it a one, two, three on teaching,

14:50.904 --> 14:55.591
research, and service in that order, possibly? Or 
would it one and two be together, the teaching and

14:55.611 --> 15:01.158
the research? I think that they want strong 
teachers. But I don't think that in terms of tenure

15:04.743 --> 15:08.128
and promotion, that you're today going to be 
tenuring or promoting somebody if it's just

15:08.767 --> 15:14.915
strictly teaching. You've got to be doing some 
research, too. All right. What about you have

15:19.281 --> 15:27.031
always been, even though you're in the 
administrative end of it now, you also have

15:19.281 --> 15:27.031
maintained that contact with students through 
your teaching. Has this tremendous growth

15:27.772 --> 15:32.818
affected how you've been able to work with 
students? Have your classes changed

15:32.858 --> 15:35.922
dramatically because of these No, I haven't 
really found them to change too much because I

15:36.560 --> 15:42.588
don't teach any undergraduate courses, and I 
never have. The ed psych department is primarily a

15:43.309 --> 15:55.184
graduate department, and we teach some 
undergraduate service courses, but usually I

15:43.309 --> 15:55.184
have not taught those. So the classes haven't, in 
terms of science, haven't changed. One thing I

16:02.032 --> 16:03.394
would say, though, that the quality of students 
has changed tremendously in terms of graduate

16:03.847 --> 16:07.713
students. Because when we first started our 
graduate programs, and this varies from

16:07.773 --> 16:17.848
department to department, but I'm just talking 
about Ed's site now. We had some pretty good

16:18.068 --> 16:23.116
students, but we had a lot of local students. And it 
wasn't as competitive to get into the department

16:28.552 --> 16:40.298
And I would say in the last five to six years it's 
become very, very competitive, especially since

16:28.552 --> 16:40.298
our doctoral program in counseling psychology 
has been accredited by the APA. You know, they get

16:42.182 --> 16:48.315
some hundred applications a year and maybe admit 
ten people into their doctoral program. And now

16:48.717 --> 16:55.244
they have an APA-accredited school psychology 
program, and that's the same way. So the students,

16:55.264 --> 17:02.251
the competitiveness and the quality of the 
students has increased quite a bit. Can you share a

17:02.271 --> 17:05.855
little bit about your role as department head? How 
many years were you department head? Five years.

17:08.477 --> 17:09.178
For five years. I'm just now starting to interview 
the department heads, and I don't know exactly

17:09.218 --> 17:16.125
what What responsibilities does the department 
head have versus being a professor, or now that you

17:16.510 --> 17:26.624
are a dean, how would you compare those? Well, I 
think that the department heads are responsible

17:26.644 --> 17:32.131
to the dean, but there's a lot of autonomy. The 
department head's job, for instance, if you

17:32.151 --> 17:36.297
compare it with my current job, there's a lot of 
difference. Because even though you report to the

17:36.337 --> 17:42.585
dean and you're a part of the college, there's 
still a lot of autonomy. You develop the budget.

17:44.550 --> 17:47.613
You're responsible for hiring and tenure and 
promotion. Even though you have faculty

17:47.653 --> 17:57.505
committees and the dean advising you or working 
with you on it, the decisions and responsibility

17:47.653 --> 17:57.505
decisions are the department head's. And I didn't 
really realize. Well, I think I did an adequate job

18:01.890 --> 18:11.982
as department head, but I didn't realize how much 
was involved in it until I got into it. Do they allow

18:12.164 --> 18:14.767
special compensation? How are department heads

18:16.850 --> 18:23.739
compensated for the extra work? There is not a 
special percentage that you get extra for being a

18:23.840 --> 18:29.247
department head. But they usually, in terms of 
salary, they usually give you a little bit bigger

18:29.267 --> 18:40.602
raise so that you're one of the better paid people. 
Do they adjust your teaching load as well? Oh, yes.

18:43.927 --> 18:50.499
On department head, like I, I would only be 
teaching one third time. And that's the same way

18:50.519 --> 18:54.006
with being in the dean's office. Now that you're in 
the dean's office and you sort of are looking from a

18:54.026 --> 19:01.560
different window, how do you see Within the 
College of Education, the collaborative effort

19:01.996 --> 19:09.707
among departments, you were part of one 
department that works evidently with several

19:01.996 --> 19:09.707
others. How much of that goes on in the college, 
this collaborative? Not as much as I'd like to say.

19:16.076 --> 19:17.938
Why and what can be done about it? I don't know. 
Well, I do know some reasons, I guess. I'm not

19:22.144 --> 19:24.007
saying that there isn't collaboration. There is. 
And I think that when Dean Corrigan came, and one of

19:25.008 --> 19:31.918
the things he was very instrumental in getting the 
faculty to initiate was the inquiry process. And

19:32.371 --> 19:35.075
that is supposed to be promoting collaboration. 
It does promote it to a certain extent. But to me,

19:37.318 --> 19:39.841
there still isn't as much collaboration. And I'm 
talking about not just between departments, but

19:40.442 --> 19:47.192
I'm also talking collaboration between faculty 
within departments. I think that one of the things

19:49.094 --> 19:57.867
that has caused our faculty to be kind of 
independent and on their own is our evaluation

19:49.094 --> 19:57.867
process. I think that... to, in terms of tenure 
promotion and salary increase, they're going to

20:00.620 --> 20:10.478
look at your teaching, but they're also going to 
look at how many articles you've published and

20:00.620 --> 20:10.478
these kinds of things. And I think that the main 
thing the faculty want to do is get their couple

20:14.491 --> 20:16.835
articles out. And I'm being a little trite here, 
and I don't mean that. But they want to get some

20:19.739 --> 20:24.887
quick article, do a little research, get some 
articles out, and get them published. And as long

20:24.907 --> 20:30.094
as my vita looks fine, that's what I need to do. And I 
think faculty do want to do collaboration, but

20:30.715 --> 20:41.832
they want some assurances that they're going to 
get adequate credit when it comes to evaluation

20:30.715 --> 20:41.832
each year. And so I'm not saying that there isn't 
collaboration, but I think we could do a lot better

20:42.284 --> 20:48.394
than we're doing. And would it require changing 
the evaluation process? Oh, yeah, yeah. Is that

20:52.421 --> 20:54.264
even feasible or possible? Yes, I think it's 
feasible. I don't see it happening, but I think

20:56.067 --> 20:58.351
it's feasible. One of the comments that one person 
made to me was that they would like to see

20:58.371 --> 21:07.566
departments just done away with and have just one 
college where you, because there's so much Not

21:08.255 --> 21:18.170
just exactly turf protection, but also the 
department has, and being that you were one,

21:08.255 --> 21:18.170
probably you can relate to this, having to fight, 
so to speak, for the resources for their

21:08.255 --> 21:18.170
department. And that sort of prevents what you're 
just saying, the collaboration, because

21:18.190 --> 21:24.340
everybody has to look out for their own. Yeah, our 
colleges, if you look at colleges of education

21:24.360 --> 21:30.870
across the country, is organized in a fairly 
traditional way. And what I'm saying about not

21:31.627 --> 21:39.696
being enough collaboration and kind of everybody 
doing their own thing is not unusual. It happens. I

21:41.078 --> 21:50.449
mean, when we were working out how to set up this 
school-university collaborative

21:41.078 --> 21:50.449
organization, we visited a number of different 
universities and major universities, too. And

21:50.569 --> 21:53.051
it's going on at other places, too. Can you tell me a 
little bit about the school-university

21:53.072 --> 21:55.975
collaborative? Because I understand that's a 
brand new endeavor that is going to have some very

22:00.972 --> 22:09.905
Well, we've been working on this for several 
years, and the one person I've been working very

22:00.972 --> 22:09.905
closely with in particular is Jim McNamara. And 
what got me involved in this or interested in this

22:09.925 --> 22:23.865
was I was getting feedback from faculty who were 
saying, I want to get into the schools to do

22:09.925 --> 22:23.865
research, and it's really difficult to get into 
the schools and do research. We need some help. And

22:25.568 --> 22:30.675
one faculty member in Ed Psych gave me a paper that 
was presented at an AERA conference on a

22:31.178 --> 22:41.548
collaborative organization they had at the 
University of Illinois, how there was an office

22:31.178 --> 22:41.548
and this woman kind of brokered research projects 
in the schools and everything. So we started

22:42.269 --> 22:48.254
looking at what we could do and we visited Illinois 
and Indiana and some other places like that. What

22:48.314 --> 22:57.203
evolved in a very quick way is that last January, 
January of 87, We had a day and a half conference in

22:57.605 --> 22:59.868
the Woodlands. And we selected eight school 
districts who we thought would be ideal school

23:00.489 --> 23:06.155
districts to work with. And the other thing, the 
other side of the coin is faculty are saying they

23:07.037 --> 23:12.123
want to get into schools and do research. But if you 
talk to teachers in the school, there's schools

23:12.383 --> 23:24.858
that are saying, well, I'm not sure if I want to work 
with these faculty in the College of Education

23:12.383 --> 23:24.858
because they're not doing research that's 
relevant or that's going to have an effect on what

23:12.383 --> 23:24.858
I'm doing in the classroom. So what we want to do is 
we want to get faculty and teachers together in the

23:27.254 --> 23:40.610
public schools and develop some joint research 
projects and some collaborative, cooperative

23:27.254 --> 23:40.610
type activities to encourage research. And so we 
had this conference and we selected eight school

23:40.630 --> 23:43.734
districts. And then we got them, asked them to make 
a commitment for the next year to kind of on a

23:45.496 --> 23:55.067
cooperative way, experimental way, to see if we 
can develop this organization. And they've

23:55.739 --> 23:58.764
developed a research project now that they're 
working on. They're collecting data on dropouts

23:58.824 --> 24:03.232
in all eight districts. And they're trying to 
analyze or collect data on the characteristics of

24:03.252 --> 24:07.559
dropouts. The next step then is that that would 
lead to intervention strategies and so on. And

24:12.848 --> 24:17.376
we've also come up with a plan for formalizing the 
organization. And we're planning a second annual

24:18.082 --> 24:27.892
conference, a school-university collaborative 
conference in the Woodlands in January. And we're

24:29.113 --> 24:34.017
going to ask each school district to formally join 
the organization. We're also asking these eight

24:34.458 --> 24:39.042
school districts to invite another school 
district. And this is going to be known, I think, as

24:39.062 --> 24:46.430
the Texas A&M School-University Collaborative 
Research Consortium. I think that's it. So I'm

24:47.697 --> 24:49.940
excited about it. And who picked this particular 
area for research? Was it the university, or was it

24:52.743 --> 24:55.827
the schools, or was it done jointly? It was kind of 
done jointly, but I would say primarily the

24:55.847 --> 24:58.550
schools. We wanted to do something that was more 
action-oriented that they felt that they needed.

25:05.979 --> 25:13.749
These things that you're doing now that you're 
talking about are going to influence the

25:05.979 --> 25:13.749
perceptions of how outsiders view the College of 
Education, obviously. Not that that's the

25:13.869 --> 25:17.113
ulterior motive that you're doing it, but it will 
help. How is that perception right now within the

25:17.735 --> 25:24.143
state for the College of Education from outside 
Texas A&M? I would think that it is very good.

25:32.413 --> 25:38.121
When we started in the 70s, we were not one of the 
major teacher education institutions in the

25:32.413 --> 25:38.121
state. And I would say today we are recognized as 
Either they are one of the major teacher education

25:43.975 --> 25:48.980
institutions in the state. Turning out more 
teachers, I think, than almost any other state

25:51.663 --> 25:56.167
institution. And also I think the quality, the 
quality of the students we're attracting and the

25:56.628 --> 26:01.132
students that we're turning out. And I try to say 
this in an objective way, but I think we're way out

26:01.873 --> 26:07.258
there. And I think also, I think in the state we have 
excellent visibility. I think that nationally we

26:12.680 --> 26:26.137
have visibility because of our dean and maybe a few 
faculty who are well-known because of the

26:12.680 --> 26:26.137
research or writing that they've done. And I think 
that we're also known because of the visibility of

26:27.739 --> 26:32.685
our dean because he's had a lot of national 
offices. And he's on the executive committee, the

26:33.326 --> 26:37.070
Holmes group. He has a lot of visibility. And he 
came here with having certainly two deanships

26:41.637 --> 26:44.301
before this one. So I think that that's it. I don't 
think we have as much visibility as the talent

26:48.146 --> 26:53.654
that's there. I think we have visibility. I think 
we have outstanding visibility in the state. I

26:59.423 --> 27:02.868
think we have visibility nationally, but I think 
it's just because of a few people. And I think that

27:04.470 --> 27:10.699
we're kind of hiding our talent under a a basket or 
something, or whatever you want to say. I think

27:16.361 --> 27:41.698
that we need to get some, and I think this is where I 
would talk about collaboration between faculty,

27:16.361 --> 27:41.698
and of course one of my jobs is external funding, 
and I guess I'm a little frustrated at times, but I

27:16.361 --> 27:41.698
think that the quality of the people that we have, 
that if we could get them to work together a little

27:16.361 --> 27:41.698
bit more, whereas we could get a couple national 
research centers here, or some really major

27:42.185 --> 27:48.453
projects, research projects, I think we would 
have that visibility. For instance, the

27:48.773 --> 27:55.721
University of Illinois has had the National 
Center for Reading that's funded by the US

27:48.773 --> 27:55.721
Department of Education. It's had it there for 10 
or 15 years. And I think overall, the quality of the

27:58.264 --> 28:04.872
faculty that we have compared with Illinois is 
very comparable. But because they've had this

28:05.233 --> 28:11.280
center and this visibility, I think that that's 
made a big difference. And we've got an

28:11.598 --> 28:20.110
outstanding reading faculty at EDCI, and they're 
really top people. So anyway. OK.

28:24.317 --> 28:37.836
Probably one of the things that I want to talk about 
a little bit is the future and what you see the

28:24.317 --> 28:37.836
College of Education at Texas A&M achieving in 
the, say, 21st century, the year 2000. I know there

28:37.896 --> 28:40.440
has been a study about the year 2000.
