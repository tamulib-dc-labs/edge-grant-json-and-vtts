WEBVTT

00:03.068 --> 00:09.537
Dr. Lewis and President Rutter and see what we can do.

00:09.557 --> 00:14.143
So he called me back in a day and he said, well, we'll pay you $16,000.

00:15.665 --> 00:16.787
And I said, that's fine.

00:16.807 --> 00:20.672
I think that's more than generous.

00:20.692 --> 00:24.557
But they doubled my salary, essentially.

00:24.577 --> 00:25.879
I think I was making $8,500.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.823
But anyway,

00:29.326 --> 00:36.687
In the process of that, Burzell left here to become head of the department over at Mississippi State.

00:38.070 --> 00:42.222
And when he left, then when I came back,

00:42.708 --> 00:56.080
Gaines said, well, we want you to head up the cotton insect program and form a lab and the field work and you sort of head up that unit.

00:56.100 --> 01:12.715
There was other, some other people in the department doing cotton work, but anyway, at that point then I could work on anything I wanted to and became sort of the point person for the research and also for,

01:12.695 --> 01:15.458
working with the industry.

01:15.859 --> 01:20.705
Where was your, where was the new lab that you used after that Quonset hut?

01:20.745 --> 01:21.045
Where did you?

01:21.065 --> 01:28.334
Well, the Quonset hut was still there, but I moved into the brick lab, which is still over there.

01:28.354 --> 01:30.136
It's called Entomology Research Lab.

01:30.797 --> 01:34.461
And I just had had an office in there, but I didn't have any space of my own.

01:34.521 --> 01:35.783
That's the reason I moved out.

01:36.370 --> 01:45.503
And then when I got back, they added 4,000 square feet to that lab, which was for me.

01:48.183 --> 01:53.630
And I'm sure that was Mr. Rudder, well, Harry, but Mr. Rudder helped prove all that.

01:55.152 --> 02:05.024
And so I guess in 1964, 65, I got a former student's award for research.

02:06.025 --> 02:09.009
And Mr. Rudder... I got the teaching in 64.

02:09.469 --> 02:10.511
Was it the same year?

02:13.254 --> 02:14.916
Dr. Turk got one.

02:15.655 --> 02:20.480
Well, John Capel was president of the former Students Association when I got there.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.260
I believe that's 65.

02:21.861 --> 02:22.361
That's 65.

02:22.602 --> 02:23.542
I believe so.

02:23.643 --> 02:23.823
Okay.

02:23.863 --> 02:24.563
I believe so.

02:25.304 --> 02:42.000
Randy Mattson had just, he sent me not long ago a copy of the Aggie in which it showed him about the shot puts, and then it had in that same issue the people who had won a

02:41.980 --> 02:45.028
faculty, former student award, and I was in that group.

02:45.089 --> 02:46.219
I think he was 65.

02:47.735 --> 02:57.906
But anyway, as a result of going to Harvard, there was a lot of fallout because Carol Williams and I became very good friends.

02:57.926 --> 03:01.890
We were collaborators and research for many years and he was a mentor.

03:03.431 --> 03:10.579
And which means that throughout my career, I've had a Harvard connection.

03:10.599 --> 03:16.425
And in higher education, they, it's opens a lot of doors.

03:16.405 --> 03:37.755
and Carroll opened a lot of doors for me, and I would never have been elected to Academy of Sciences if it had not been for that because he, I'm sure he sponsored my nomination to the Academy, and so I was elected to the Academy of Sciences in 1979, which was

03:38.697 --> 03:40.881
I guess that was a high point in my career.

03:44.227 --> 03:47.513
I was the first person elected to the academy from Texas A&M.

03:49.236 --> 03:56.048
And not that we hadn't had some academy members, but I was the first one as a bona fide A&M faculty member.

03:57.158 --> 04:02.409
I can tell you that's not easy to do.

04:02.429 --> 04:13.952
Would it be appropriate to guess that the team, you and he, that you were the real world applied and he was the theoretical?

04:14.590 --> 04:15.892
Yeah, yeah.

04:15.912 --> 04:28.452
He didn't have, he was not, you know, his interest was all in basic theoretical and basic research where I had to be concerned about controlling insects and cotton fields for farmers.

04:29.433 --> 04:31.557
Yeah, yeah.

04:31.577 --> 04:39.990
As you're making this rapid progress, did that cause any awkwardness for you in the department with your colleagues?

04:41.641 --> 04:42.842
I don't think so.

04:42.862 --> 04:43.643
I don't think so.

04:43.964 --> 04:53.815
I had good, really, I had good personal relationships with everybody in the department.

04:53.935 --> 04:56.338
That's what I thought.

04:56.358 --> 05:10.855
And I think they were proud of my accomplishments, what I did, and I thought, you know, any recognition I received brought some recognition to the department.

05:11.071 --> 05:14.854
Dr. Gaines decided to retire in 1967.

05:20.600 --> 05:27.166
Conkle called me and asked me if I would serve as acting department head.

05:29.388 --> 05:33.631
And I said, I don't really want to do that.

05:34.953 --> 05:39.897
If you want me to be department head, I'll be department head, but I don't really want to be acting department head.

05:44.028 --> 06:04.418
So we talked about that some, and so he finally said, well, why don't you take it as acting and with provision that you'll be considered for department head, and the chances are you'll be the next department head.

06:04.438 --> 06:06.401
So I said, well, okay, I'll do that.

06:06.561 --> 06:10.727
And I'll also tell you there are some people, if they are made department head, I'm gone.

06:12.563 --> 06:20.139
And there weren't people who were here, but there were some people that, you know, I'm not giving you an ultimatum, I'm just telling you the truth.

06:20.740 --> 06:26.813
There are some people that are, I wouldn't work for, that are out there that would like to be here.

06:27.775 --> 06:29.138
And if they come, I'm gone.

06:31.025 --> 06:33.629
So he said, you don't have to worry about that.

06:33.709 --> 06:37.676
But anyway, I did have to interview Mr. Rutter.

06:39.198 --> 06:43.465
I don't know if he interviewed all the department heads or not, but... Please describe that interview.

06:45.328 --> 06:53.521
Well... Because we don't, see, we don't know much about Mr. Rutter's personal management style.

06:55.565 --> 06:55.885
Um...

07:00.488 --> 07:02.672
I can't remember much about it, Haskell.

07:02.692 --> 07:08.384
I can remember during that process I was doing a lot of work at Lubbock.

07:08.424 --> 07:19.246
The boll weevil had just begun to threaten the High Plains area and we were, I had told the people in that area that I was working on an experimental program.

07:19.306 --> 07:21.130
There was an experimental program that

07:21.650 --> 07:30.815
Jim Berzell and myself and others have been working on, I thought might work to keep that weevil out of there, but it had never really been tested on large scale.

07:31.938 --> 07:33.803
So they decided that they'd go with it.

07:35.015 --> 07:44.126
So we implemented that program and under a lot of controversy at the beginning as whether it was going to work or not.

07:44.146 --> 07:53.158
And I had spent three or four days a week in Lubbock during the growing season and trying to maintain a program here too.

07:54.019 --> 07:58.204
And it was at a time that A&M and Texas Tech were having a lot of problems.

07:58.640 --> 08:01.643
in the legislature over appropriations.

08:02.804 --> 08:11.392
And there was no friendship between A&M and Texas Tech, particularly in the ag program among the administration.

08:12.894 --> 08:19.740
But I had gotten along with people out there all right and said, you know, we ought to quit fighting with Texas Tech and us cooperate.

08:19.780 --> 08:27.027
They can't, there's no way that they can compete with us in research, so we ought to just start cooperating with them.

08:27.547 --> 08:35.380
But anyway, the Plains cotton growers gave me a certificate or a plaque of,

08:37.452 --> 08:45.842
an award or distinguished achievement or something for all the work I'd done out there.

08:45.862 --> 08:55.474
And they, they asked me and Kunkel to come to Lubbock where they could present that award and Harry went.

08:56.015 --> 09:00.540
We just got the new King Air, the first new King Air and we flew out there.

09:04.098 --> 09:09.004
Well, I think that was the most impressive thing with Rudder.

09:09.024 --> 09:23.762
When we talked, he just sort of sized me up and he mentioned, he said, you know, that he was impressed that I had received an award from Plains cotton growers since they were so oriented to Texas Tech.

09:24.844 --> 09:31.472
And I said to you, what I, to him, what I said to you is I think, you know, we ought to quit fighting them and cooperate with them and

09:32.009 --> 09:44.245
We'd both gained by it, and he never asked me anything about my management style or anything, as I remember it didn't last very long.

09:45.187 --> 09:53.838
Did it appear, as you recall, did it appear that he had reviewed your materials, that he knew a little?

09:53.858 --> 09:55.941
Yeah, he knew quite a bit about

09:56.933 --> 10:18.665
Because somewhere, you know, for a long time, when I'd be going into the administration building to go to the experiment station for Dr. Lewis or go see Roy Hagler or some of the people about projects and things, you'd pass him in the foyer and I'd always speak, but he didn't know who I was.

10:18.685 --> 10:24.173
But when I went to Harvard and I got back, he knew who I was.

10:24.153 --> 10:27.256
And he always called me Perry.

10:27.276 --> 10:39.568
And so somewhere in that period of going to Harvard, he became aware of who I was, and he'd always call me by my first name.

10:40.309 --> 10:46.635
And I didn't know him that well, and I stood in awe of him, you know, because here I am.

10:46.735 --> 10:50.599
I'm 30-something years old and just starting a career.

10:51.305 --> 10:55.531
But anyway, he approved it, and so I became department head in 1967.

10:56.252 --> 11:06.305
And at that time, the department was fairly small.

11:07.346 --> 11:08.848
It was like the rest of A&M.

11:08.948 --> 11:12.553
It was regional and outlook and regional in scope.

11:13.208 --> 11:15.831
Were you all doing degrees at all three levels?

11:15.911 --> 11:16.192
Yeah.

11:16.252 --> 11:21.158
We were given Ph.D.s when I, when I, I think the first Ph.D.

11:21.218 --> 11:26.785
was granted Dr. Little, who was a professor here in 1945 or something in entomology.

11:26.885 --> 11:29.769
So they'd given quite a few Ph.D.

11:29.789 --> 11:30.230
degrees.

11:30.890 --> 11:42.405
Now other than your research, particularly related to cotton, what were the other major research efforts then in the Department of Entomology as you became department head?

11:42.605 --> 12:10.873
Well, we had Neil Randolph handle forage crops, feeding forage crops, sorghum, alfalfa range, and Manny Price was doing work on livestock, and Donald King was working on fruit tree crops, and Lynn Hannah and Knox Walker were working on cotton and myself, and

12:15.072 --> 12:20.078
Shortly, well before I became department head, we hired a toxicologist named Wyman Durer.

12:25.746 --> 12:31.653
But the scope of the department was pretty narrow and pretty limited.

12:31.673 --> 12:42.227
Did you have, as you became department head, did you identify personally some goals for the department that you wanted?

12:43.996 --> 12:45.959
Became department head at the right time.

12:48.143 --> 12:50.146
I came to Texas A&M at the right time.

12:50.907 --> 12:57.678
You see, a lot of things were going on in science when I, it was not long after I got here, the Russians shot Sputnik, Sputnik.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.282
And Kennedy became president.

13:00.863 --> 13:08.636
And then the budgets for the National Science Foundation and money for research became much more available.

13:09.016 --> 13:11.320
John Connolly became governor.

13:11.300 --> 13:14.866
double the salaries of everybody around here in this term, you know.

13:15.667 --> 13:23.280
And so if you talk about hitting the place at the right time, I came to the right time.

13:24.782 --> 13:29.089
I don't think I could have accomplished, now I couldn't do what I did then.

13:30.689 --> 13:42.927
I couldn't have done what I did back then because a different kind of faculty is much more competitive.

13:44.813 --> 13:49.719
At the time, shortly after I became department head, I began to talk.

13:51.241 --> 13:57.428
I said, you know, we've got to change the way of doing business in crop protection because we're too dependent on chemicals.

13:58.049 --> 14:00.812
Insects are getting resistant to all of them.

14:00.832 --> 14:05.358
We're having all kinds of environmental problems now coming apparent.

14:05.378 --> 14:08.982
And if we're going to maintain our productivity,

14:08.962 --> 14:13.612
in the state, we've got to change.

14:13.632 --> 14:25.738
And some of the insects had become so resistant to the chemicals, they were just destroying the cotton industry in South Texas.

14:27.760 --> 14:36.799
So I had good support of the cotton growers who had become well organized.

14:36.819 --> 14:48.503
And so we developed a statewide plan for insect control major crops.

14:49.478 --> 14:56.667
And I took this plan to the growers and said, you know, here's what we need to do.

14:57.608 --> 15:01.273
But we can't do it without positions and support.

15:01.293 --> 15:08.182
I mean, the people we've got here in the department have so much teaching, they can't do it.

15:08.282 --> 15:12.207
They can't teach all the courses and we, it's too big a problem.

15:12.287 --> 15:17.494
So I was able during that time to,

15:18.875 --> 15:25.442
Gained support and we got legislative support and created about 30 positions.

15:26.263 --> 15:30.208
Who were the key people in the legislature that supported that?

15:30.228 --> 15:35.434
Well, Hobby was Lieutenant Governor.

15:36.615 --> 15:38.417
Billy Clayton was Speaker of the House.

15:39.678 --> 15:44.764
And we had good support, particularly from Billy and Hobby.

15:44.744 --> 16:11.443
What about local, did the local delegation... Well, we had good support from Bill Presnell, who was chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and Bill Moore was in the Senate in a good place, and then he was followed by Kent Caperton, and we had good support from

16:12.993 --> 16:21.426
the rural legislators, but I met Barbara Jordan during that period.

16:21.446 --> 16:29.940
And we had a session over banning DDT in 19, about 1972.

16:30.020 --> 16:37.532
There was a move by people in the urban areas wanted to ban DDT.

16:38.474 --> 16:40.057
And they were, they organized.

16:40.117 --> 16:42.741
I mean, they had organized groups, mostly young women.

16:43.642 --> 16:48.049
And they marched on the Capitol.

16:48.069 --> 16:59.928
And I remember that we were put together this plan for what we call a statewide pest management plan, it's integrated pest management, which I was touting.

17:00.809 --> 17:06.338
And I was in the Capitol and Barbara Jordan sent word she wanted to talk to me.

17:07.938 --> 17:16.675
And I was there with a bunch of farmers who were trying to get money appropriated for hearings.

17:17.817 --> 17:21.063
So I went to see her.

17:21.143 --> 17:23.027
She's now a senator at this point.

17:23.688 --> 17:25.592
She's a state senator.

17:27.007 --> 17:30.531
Well, I went into the office and I had never met her.

17:30.611 --> 17:38.398
I'd just seen her picture and stuff and knew a little bit about her when reading the Houston Chronicle, but I'd never met Barbara Jordan.

17:38.418 --> 17:44.745
And she was a large black woman, very impressive.

17:44.765 --> 17:56.997
And she said to me, Dr. Atkinson, I want you to sit down here and explain to me what you're trying to do, that I've had a lot of people

17:57.770 --> 18:03.984
from Houston and Dallas coming through my office wanting us to ban these pesticides.

18:04.966 --> 18:13.885
And I said, what I'm really concerned about is what effect that might have on the price of food in the fifth ward of Houston.

18:14.166 --> 18:16.892
I think it was fifth ward that I represent.

18:18.526 --> 18:42.036
So, so I said, well, that what I'm trying to get support to do is change the way we're doing crop protection that we can't do without pesticides, but we can sure use them in a much better way and that we can't just continue the way we've been going.

18:42.522 --> 18:45.987
And Texas was just complete dependence on chemicals.

18:46.828 --> 18:49.591
And the chemical company people were fighting me.

18:49.611 --> 18:52.014
They had a very strong lobby.

18:52.034 --> 18:57.341
And I said, you know, I've had people trying to get my job.

18:57.361 --> 19:04.170
They've been to the dean and to the director and said, you know, this guy's got to go.

19:04.190 --> 19:08.496
But they haven't got my job and they're not going to get him.

19:09.337 --> 19:20.773
Because what I'm doing, the farmers are for, and in fact, the people, they're meeting with these anti-pesticide people, and they're going to come to a common ground.

19:22.255 --> 19:27.782
And what we're going to try to do is going to be opposed by the chemical companies, in my opinion.

19:29.164 --> 19:32.689
So she said, you've got my support.

19:32.709 --> 19:35.833
So that was my meeting with Barbara Jordan, but I remembered it.

19:37.501 --> 19:41.685
Did you run into any diehard opponents?

19:41.705 --> 19:47.211
Oh, we didn't have much of a problem in the legislature.

19:47.311 --> 20:01.686
We had some problems fostered by the National Cotton Council and some of the chemical companies, some of our own graduates in the chemical companies that thought we were going to

20:03.016 --> 20:04.138
too far the other way.

20:05.441 --> 20:08.588
Now, by the time you finished, was Conley gone?

20:08.848 --> 20:09.850
Was there a different governor?

20:09.870 --> 20:12.616
Yeah, let's see.

20:12.636 --> 20:23.539
Yeah, Conley was – this was in the – about in the early 70s, and I don't know –

20:24.903 --> 20:27.431
Dolph Briscoe was governor.

20:27.572 --> 20:28.274
Okay.

20:28.294 --> 20:28.675
Yeah.

20:28.695 --> 20:29.277
So he would.

20:29.598 --> 20:30.441
He would understand.

20:30.481 --> 20:30.842
Yeah.

20:30.862 --> 20:37.022
He was very supportive and that's where I met Dolph Briscoe and we've been friends ever since.

20:38.048 --> 20:44.775
But in the process, we said to the legislature, we want to do this in stages.

20:45.476 --> 20:46.978
So we want to do stage one.

20:46.998 --> 20:50.321
And if it works, we'll come back and report on it and show you the results.

20:50.421 --> 20:53.324
And if it does, then we'd like to move on stage two.

20:53.465 --> 21:04.576
And the big problem first stage is in cotton, but we got similar problems in peanuts and citrus and sorghum, all our major crops.

21:04.636 --> 21:06.098
And we've got to do something about them.

21:07.208 --> 21:13.757
But in the process then, I had an opportunity to recast the department.

21:15.520 --> 21:25.554
And so, again, I didn't have to deal with faculty search committees and all that.

21:25.815 --> 21:28.018
What I had to deal with was build a consensus.

21:29.551 --> 21:53.441
So I said to the senior members of the department, that's Neil Randolph and Manning Price and Horace Burke, they're all A&M graduates, guys, we got a chance now to make an entomology department at A&M that would be as good as any in the country.

21:54.843 --> 21:58.107
And what I would propose to do

21:59.858 --> 22:06.408
is let's go hire some of the best graduates out of some of the best departments in the country.

22:06.868 --> 22:08.811
Now who, where were those best departments?

22:09.452 --> 22:26.878
Well, University of California at Berkeley, University of California at Riverside, Cornell, Michigan State, Illinois,

22:30.149 --> 22:31.270
places like that.

22:32.572 --> 22:43.023
So I said, what we need to do is let's identify, we all know who the top people are in the field.

22:43.043 --> 22:45.826
So let's, I want to go to those people.

22:45.906 --> 22:46.507
I know them.

22:47.067 --> 22:54.876
I want to go to their lab and visit with them and tell them we're going to have openings coming open and I want their best graduate student.

22:55.396 --> 22:56.157
I want you to,

22:56.542 --> 23:02.028
And I don't care whether he's getting a degree now or whether he got one in the previous three or four years.

23:02.488 --> 23:05.791
Because if he's just gotten out in two or three years, fine.

23:06.512 --> 23:07.653
That'd be fine.

23:07.673 --> 23:11.137
If he get past five years, he probably can't afford him.

23:11.157 --> 23:14.140
But that's what we want to do.

23:14.180 --> 23:20.386
And we want your university to have a presence in Texas A&M.

23:20.406 --> 23:24.270
We want to diversify.

23:25.043 --> 23:29.149
Everybody said, you know, that's a good game plan.

23:29.170 --> 23:38.124
Let's identify the universities where we need to have, where we'd like to have somebody from there on our faculty so we can send students there.

23:39.165 --> 23:52.907
And the one problem we've had here at A&M, Haskell, when I came until recent years, at least in agriculture, and I think it's true across the board, we weren't able to put graduates in faculty positions.

23:53.157 --> 24:03.690
Now we put a lot of our graduates in the USDA, but we didn't have any faculty members at Cornell or Michigan or the number one schools, and as a result,

24:05.003 --> 24:14.317
You can say, well, A&M's got a pedestrian product that we don't, you know, they're not well-rounded and they're not well-trained.

24:14.397 --> 24:25.234
And so, you know, we can't, the only way we're going to break that is we've got to bring in some of the best students from those places and we'll start the pipeline.

24:25.254 --> 24:29.020
And then eventually we'll be putting faculty members out.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.504
in a lot of universities, which has happened.

24:31.564 --> 24:33.507
That prophecy has come true.

24:34.768 --> 24:41.819
So we had good budget support.

24:41.839 --> 24:45.083
We got some new facilities, got this new building here.

24:45.945 --> 24:51.132
And this dream begins in the 70s, early 70s?

24:51.573 --> 24:56.079
Well, it began in 67 when I became department head.

24:56.099 --> 24:56.560
Okay.

24:56.540 --> 25:00.750
But this, this... But I didn't have the means to do it until in the early 70s.

25:00.770 --> 25:01.491
That's what I was meaning.

25:01.652 --> 25:01.852
Yeah.

25:01.952 --> 25:03.736
You began to have... Okay.

25:03.756 --> 25:03.857
Yeah.

25:03.877 --> 25:09.710
So I visited lots of departments as department head.

25:10.752 --> 25:11.494
And I...

25:13.482 --> 25:15.085
That's my pocket organizer.

25:15.125 --> 25:19.454
I've carried one of these little books from, it used to be Seba Geige.

25:20.936 --> 25:33.942
And every time, and I was given quite a few invitational lectures at the time, but every time I went to a university, and after a lecture or something, we met and talked with students.

25:33.962 --> 25:35.625
If somebody really impressed me,

25:37.360 --> 25:48.453
I'd write his name down or her name down and think, well, if we get a position this year or next year, that's somebody we'll want to think about.

25:49.233 --> 25:52.918
So I was out cherry picking.

25:52.938 --> 26:03.790
And as a result, we hired, all told, I think we had about

26:04.799 --> 26:09.248
30 some positions, but about half of them were in extension out in the centers.

26:10.430 --> 26:15.820
So I was able to cherry pick for here.

26:15.841 --> 26:17.644
Now the center is a little different story.

26:19.177 --> 26:24.745
It's hard to get people to come to Texas to stay in the center.

26:24.785 --> 26:27.950
I've been at the center and I know what the problems are.

26:28.010 --> 26:28.832
They're really good.

26:28.872 --> 26:29.993
They won't stay long.

26:30.013 --> 26:31.075
You're going to go to the campus.

26:32.157 --> 26:41.851
So I found out after one or two failures where I hired somebody that came and just get a program started and you spend a lot of money on them and then they're gone.

26:42.653 --> 26:46.939
That's where you need to hire your Texas A&M graduates, your good ones.

26:48.455 --> 26:55.045
put them in, so I hired several of them at the center and then some of them eventually ended up here on the faculty because they were quite good.

26:55.907 --> 27:09.788
But as a result of that, we hired probably 15 or so really top flight young PhDs who are now senior professors here in Early Air

27:10.561 --> 27:18.011
Well, one of them's dean at the University of Missouri now, but one or two left for better administrative jobs.

27:18.031 --> 27:24.059
But a big part of them are still here as senior professors, and they've done really well there.

27:24.099 --> 27:30.267
I mean, A&M's entomology department is well-respected, and it's well-diversified.

27:30.327 --> 27:32.409
I mean, we're in basic research.

27:32.470 --> 27:33.651
We're in bowel control.

27:34.312 --> 27:35.534
We're in chemical control.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.556
We're in all aspects.

27:38.437 --> 27:40.500
And I'm assuming that

27:40.480 --> 27:47.577
the research budget would show a nice increase during that same period.

27:47.597 --> 27:48.018
Yeah, yeah.

27:48.038 --> 27:59.164
Well, we got quite a bit of state support, but as a result of that and the fact we had some really bright people come in, then they were competitive on us.

27:59.515 --> 28:09.795
national scene and they began to get money on the National Science Foundation and competitive grant program, USDA competitive grants.

28:10.336 --> 28:19.875
So when I left the Department of Entomology, they had the largest grant budget, I think, of any department in the university maybe, but certainly in the College of Agriculture.

28:20.015 --> 28:21.658
Now when did you leave the department?

28:21.638 --> 28:31.493
Well, I became vice president for agriculture, Jarvis Miller and Mike Prescott, on April Fool's Day, 1978.

28:31.773 --> 28:43.090
And after a considerable conversation with Jarvis, I didn't really want to do that.

28:44.133 --> 28:48.726
But anyway, I did, and after about six months of talking.

28:48.746 --> 28:50.411
So you were department head for?

28:51.253 --> 28:53.359
From 1967 to 1978.

28:55.485 --> 28:59.256
When did you begin, are there some events

28:59.236 --> 29:07.524
during that period when you could see that here was clear evidence of progress?

29:07.965 --> 29:12.730
Were there some research grants or national honors?

29:12.750 --> 29:18.315
Well, let me put it in a little broader context.

29:21.459 --> 29:25.443
When I came to Texas A&M, I don't know when you came.

29:25.803 --> 29:26.063
59.

29:26.784 --> 29:28.686
All right, we came here at the same time.

29:30.134 --> 29:44.152
I don't know what you, what your perspective was, but I found A&M to be a, what I would call a regional Cal College, very parochial.

29:46.535 --> 29:55.686
I don't think it's as good a university as University of Arkansas.

29:56.662 --> 30:00.548
They didn't tolerate people who thought beyond the envelope.

30:01.410 --> 30:06.518
They didn't tolerate unconventional wisdom very well.

30:07.620 --> 30:15.673
And it was just a small university and it was mostly known for the core.

30:16.935 --> 30:20.120
And we didn't have many faculty members.

30:20.140 --> 30:23.445
They were all nice people and they were good teachers.

30:23.864 --> 30:32.616
But I don't think we had many that would be considered very distinguished at the national level or international level.

30:32.636 --> 30:44.352
And I say that one of the things that Mr. Rudder did was break that.

30:44.372 --> 30:47.196
He began to look for the best people.

30:47.717 --> 30:53.685
Now, and John Calhoun, I think, helped him in that a lot.

30:55.505 --> 31:12.111
But when I started even in 1968 of trying to hire people from California or Cornell, I had people in the faculty say, well, Perry, we can't hire those people.

31:12.131 --> 31:14.594
And I said, well, let's let them make that decision.

31:14.615 --> 31:17.118
Let's don't make it far.

31:17.739 --> 31:19.722
Let's bring them here and let them make that decision.

31:20.684 --> 31:22.727
Well, I think Mr.
