WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:04.221
your colleagues when you got here? Who were they 
and what were their specialties and so forth?

00:07.465 --> 00:12.913
Before I do that, there's one more thing I thought 
of that Jack Williams said that evening that I've

00:07.465 --> 00:12.913
not forgotten. One, and I don't recall, this is not 
a direct quote, but it's fairly close. He said,

00:18.260 --> 00:23.948
right as his closing comments, he said, I hope that 
you're all welcome here. We're pleased that you

00:23.988 --> 00:25.790
came our way. You'll make us better for having been 
here. But I hope each of you, like young people, And

00:31.351 --> 00:33.895
I hope that you think they are our best hope for the 
future. And if you don't, I hope your stay here is

00:34.776 --> 00:37.540
very, very short. And I remember that and have used 
that many times along the way. In our department

00:44.250 --> 00:46.934
when I got here was a guy named Linus Dow. And Linus 
was a biomechanics type person. He studied the

00:51.621 --> 01:00.615
angles of bouncing balls and muscle joints and 
those kind of things, the most efficient way to do

00:51.621 --> 01:00.615
an activity. course Carl Landis was the 
department head. Carl had gotten his degree at

01:05.030 --> 01:11.180
Penn State and Landis had gotten his degree at 
Missouri.

01:13.745 --> 01:24.443
There's a guy named Jack Chivret who was a Canadian 
who did his undergraduate work in Springfield

01:13.745 --> 01:24.443
College which was the very first program in 
physical education where basketball was that's

01:25.486 --> 01:54.463
right that's right and he he had gotten his 
doctorate from florida state he ran he did the

01:25.486 --> 01:54.463
student teaching program and did that very well he 
was very organized and detailed and and took care

01:25.486 --> 01:54.463
of things well emil mamaluga who was the director 
of the act what we call the activity program then

01:25.486 --> 01:54.463
the the program where they taught taught 
different sports skills like golf and tennis and

01:54.764 --> 01:59.729
racquetball and so forth. Leslie Palmer was the 
admiral director. We had an adjunct whose name was

02:06.836 --> 02:15.866
Dr. Bill Roman, no BGYN in town, who taught a human 
diseases course. Mildred Little had come in with

02:18.088 --> 02:24.214
me and she was an outdoor education type person. 
Homer Tolson, testing measurements,

02:25.730 --> 02:31.877
statistics. He came from Purdue. One of the very 
best teachers I've ever seen, and certainly one of

02:35.501 --> 02:40.626
the best I've seen in that particular field. 
Robert Hurley was my colleague in health

02:42.708 --> 02:48.034
education and had a degree from Utah, University 
of Utah. And George Jessup. who was in exercise

02:51.582 --> 02:57.392
physiology and he came from the University of 
Southern California. And every one of those guys

02:58.694 --> 03:08.831
and gals are now retired, which gave me my first 
clue that it was time for me to retire. Also, they

03:08.851 --> 03:15.042
seem to me to be geographically diverse. Very 
diverse faculty. We had, I see, I guess had a degree

03:17.738 --> 03:23.925
from A&M and Les Palmer did. And they were the only 
ones with local degrees. And everyone else was

03:27.088 --> 03:28.449
spread out. Dow from Missouri, Landis from Penn 
State, Florida State, Mildred Little from the

03:28.509 --> 03:40.661
University of Texas, Tolson, Purdue, Hurley, 
Utah, I was from Tennessee, and Jessup from USC. So

03:41.122 --> 03:42.463
it was an eclectic group. As far as you can recall, 
what were your first course assignments? I came

03:50.711 --> 03:54.095
here to direct the Allied Health Program. And so my 
first year I was 75% time on that grant. Okay. The

04:00.982 --> 04:02.984
next year I was 50% time. The following year I was 
25% time and then I was 100%. So my first teaching

04:06.688 --> 04:10.813
assignment was to teach an undergraduate class 
methodology, methods of teaching health. And for

04:14.890 --> 04:28.438
the first time, I taught that course before, but as 
I said earlier, at Southeastern, we taught 15

04:14.890 --> 04:28.438
hours a semester and you just hardly could do 
anything except go to school and write papers. For

04:29.119 --> 04:30.422
the first time, I had a chance to really planned for 
that class and I thought I got pretty good at it. I

04:36.584 --> 04:42.553
also taught a graduate course called Health 
Careers which no longer exists and for good

04:36.584 --> 04:42.553
reason. Now this first course was for 
upper-class? It was a capstone course for our

04:46.059 --> 04:49.544
graduating seniors. Describe your first 
impression of Aggie students. Well I had mostly

04:55.213 --> 04:57.456
men I think there was three girls, three or four 
girls in that class, and it was a large class, about

04:57.875 --> 05:02.284
40 in there. Nearly all of them wore boots. All of 
them were in uniform, except there were a handful

05:05.891 --> 05:11.502
of men who were not in uniform and, of course, none 
of the women.

05:15.009 --> 05:16.592
They were... They were good students. I was 
singularly impressed with that. Of course, the

05:20.780 --> 05:27.288
school where I was in southeast Louisiana didn't 
draw the very best of students than it was anyway,

05:20.780 --> 05:27.288
so that was a step up from that point of view. But 
they were good kids. They were well-behaved. If

05:32.814 --> 05:35.016
you called on them, they would give you an at you. 
But if you didn't call on them, they weren't going

05:35.577 --> 05:39.441
to volunteer anything. Very polite. Attended.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.292
You didn't have to worry about whether they were 
going to be in school or not. They came? They came to

05:49.634 --> 05:50.395
class. In that era, did you check the roll? I did 
check the roll. I did it for a reason entirely

05:55.340 --> 05:58.403
different than attendance, though. Until 
several years later, I tried to learn every

06:00.366 --> 06:04.310
student's name. And by the end of the first three or 
four weeks, if I called roll every day, I would have

06:05.191 --> 06:09.816
it. And these students, as far as you could tell, 
where were they from and what was their basic

06:10.505 --> 06:22.489
philosophical outlook on life? It had a definite 
rural blend to it. Like now, there were some

06:27.260 --> 06:39.854
students from Houston and some from Dallas, but 
most of them were regional kids from Brenham and

06:27.260 --> 06:39.854
Hearn and Snook and places like that. A lot of them, 
looking back, I didn't think about it then because

06:39.874 --> 06:50.486
it didn't seem unreasonable to me, but looking 
back, are unusual to me. Looking back, I... I think

06:52.878 --> 06:59.788
most of them were first-generation college kids, 
and pretty much in awe of the university. Their

07:02.031 --> 07:06.898
philosophy was, let me get in, get this done, and 
get out. I have to go to work. Were most of them

07:10.002 --> 07:12.145
majors in the department? Yeah, all of these would 
be majors, because it was a capstone. And as far as

07:14.629 --> 07:17.092
you could tell, what was their career goal? They 
were all going to be teachers or coaches. At that

07:19.372 --> 07:23.116
time, that's the only option we had in our program. 
And how did they introduce you to any Aggie ways of

07:24.397 --> 07:32.324
doing things or excuses or pranks? Oh, I learned 
more stuff that year than I would ever learn. Share

07:36.008 --> 07:37.549
some of it. Well, believe it or not, I had never 
heard an Aggie joke until I came on this campus. All

07:43.635 --> 07:46.898
the Aggie jokes I heard were here. And one of the 
things I had learned pretty quick as I moved out, I

07:47.300 --> 07:57.881
spent that first year in Austin a lot because I was 
developing this allied health program and

07:47.300 --> 07:57.881
putting together brochures and things. And I was 
moving around the state trying to meet some of the

07:57.901 --> 08:02.710
schools where that was being taught. And 
everywhere I'd go, people would be delighted to

08:03.230 --> 08:06.955
tell me an Aggie joke. So I put a few pro-Aggie jokes 
in my arsenal to use along the way. Of course, the

08:12.644 --> 08:17.230
walk, I'd never heard of the walk before. They 
tried to introduce that to me very quickly. We need

08:20.235 --> 08:21.296
a walk on Friday. I'll never forget the first 
elephant walk. I thought we were being marched on

08:25.222 --> 08:30.790
by, this was 72, and they were still marching in 
some campus. I thought they were They were about to

08:31.833 --> 08:36.140
march on the president's office.

08:40.307 --> 08:46.517
CT, that term came up, and I had the ignorance of 
asking what that meant in class. And a lot of red

08:47.378 --> 08:51.765
faces, and one kid said, Dr. Ponder, I'll tell you 
after class. But they all giggle about that. Do you

08:57.391 --> 09:03.838
remember any, in that first year or so, any pranks 
or jokes on you that they attempted? No, they

09:04.218 --> 09:04.699
didn't. I

09:04.839 --> 09:13.187
always had the kind of demeanor, I think, that kept 
a glass wall someplace. Someone taught me that

09:13.208 --> 09:14.689
pretty early. But I remember wearing an orange tie 
to class one day. I had to go home and dig all that

09:19.943 --> 09:25.370
stuff out, because coming out of Tennessee, I had 
some orange things. Did someone say anything? Oh,

09:26.952 --> 09:27.774
yes. They said, we don't like your tie. And I said, 
well, I normally let my wife dress me. I thought it

09:35.644 --> 09:36.906
went all right. She said, it's not that. We don't 
like the color of your tie. I said, well, it matches

09:40.671 --> 09:41.773
all right. No, it doesn't match A&M at all. That's

09:45.577 --> 09:49.825
a good one. Let's see.

09:54.173 --> 09:56.237
You were there pretty well all day. Did Dr. Landis 
practice himself the expectations he had? Oh yes.

10:06.998 --> 10:08.260
No question about that. He was there early and he 
left late. And how did he keep the department

10:11.655 --> 10:13.997
pooled together? Did you all have regular 
meetings? We had regular meetings. At that time,

10:17.520 --> 10:20.503
we could all meet in a room smaller than this one. 
But we would have regular faculty meetings. And of

10:24.127 --> 10:30.032
course, he used memos with great regularity. We 
had a meeting place like all the departments had

10:30.793 --> 10:34.016
then. We had a coffee room and a mail room. It was 
kind of common practice around 10 o'clock, if you

10:36.539 --> 10:42.706
didn't have a class, you wandered down and checked 
your mail. And there were a lot of impromptu

10:42.726 --> 10:47.611
meetings would occur right there around a coffee 
pot. And so, by and large, you all had coffee in the

10:47.871 --> 10:50.935
department? Yes, we did. And then where did you and 
your closest colleagues go eat lunch? Across the

10:56.261 --> 11:00.686
street, MSC was right across the street from us, so 
a lot of people would go over there. I would go home

11:00.706 --> 11:03.829
often. It wasn't that hard of a drive. Even though 
it was quite a piece of way, I could make it in about

11:06.804 --> 11:09.587
seven minutes. I had, I think, two lights between 
me and the house. And you parked? I parked right by

11:13.531 --> 11:16.815
my building, walked right to it. Was there even a 
parking fee? There was no parking fee. I thought I

11:19.938 --> 11:21.520
didn't remember one at that time. We had a bumper 
sticker, but no parking fee.

11:28.968 --> 11:34.153
In terms of how did you and your wife, how did you all 
become part of the community?

11:36.749 --> 11:38.731
That was no problem at all. This, as you know, is an 
unusual community. We were told when we got here

11:42.656 --> 11:46.321
that we'd be busy. And we looked around and saw a 
sleepy little town. And how could that be? And we

11:51.888 --> 11:59.037
realized early on that you had to learn to say no 
because there were just so many opportunities

11:51.888 --> 11:59.037
that came your way. But what really impressed us 
was we came from, Southeastern is a strong Italian

11:59.557 --> 12:05.625
town. Granted, some Cajun in that area, but mostly 
Italians. And they're very slow to take you in, and

12:09.252 --> 12:12.198
really good people. Once they adopt you, you're 
adopted. But we didn't have that problem here.

12:17.668 --> 12:20.273
Even the grocery stores, folks were friendly. And 
I still hear that. When we get a new faculty who

12:22.096 --> 12:28.288
comes in for an interview, they still remark about 
how friendly people are. So we were absorbed. It

12:29.888 --> 12:32.692
was almost like we had always lived here. One thing 
that helped us was there was a guy named Walter

12:32.712 --> 12:37.920
Penberthy, which we call Penny. Penny's wife and 
my wife's mother were good friends.

12:49.463 --> 12:53.491
One of my wife's mother's good friends had gone to 
school with Lollibeth. And so we knew them almost

12:54.313 --> 12:56.538
instantly. And when we came for an interview, we 
were told to look them up. But we didn't. We didn't

13:02.009 --> 13:03.673
know them from anyone else. But after we got here 
and we settled and knew them, well, really worked

13:07.317 --> 13:09.640
us over for not having come by our house. But they 
instantly introduced us to their circle of

13:09.660 --> 13:13.885
friends. And the department had several social 
kinds of things during the year. Yeah, describe

13:19.112 --> 13:20.113
those. Well, we had an ice cream social to begin the 
year. Everybody could turn a half gallon of ice

13:22.857 --> 13:26.361
cream. And we had cookies and ice cream. We had a 
golf tournament in the early part of the year and at

13:30.046 --> 13:35.012
the end of the year. They had what they called the 
fin and feather tournament, where the fin was

13:35.363 --> 13:43.675
fishing and feather was birdies for golf. And we 
did those kinds of activities. And then having a

13:47.580 --> 13:50.845
watering hole in the department helped an awful 
lot. It was an easy matriculation from that point

13:52.447 --> 13:55.792
of view. Did you all join any organizations off 
campus, churches, anything? Well, we were. Of

14:00.980 --> 14:09.771
course, we're Baptists, so we very quickly joined 
the First Baptist Church in Bryan, and that's

14:00.980 --> 14:09.771
instant family and friends. I tried my hand at the 
Qantas Club for a short time. I joined a breakfast

14:14.196 --> 14:18.722
club, but gosh, those guys eat early in the 
morning. Trying to get up and get to that and then

14:18.742 --> 14:23.207
get to work was more than I could do. And the wives 
got together quite often. They had what they

14:26.322 --> 14:30.328
called the nitwits, which they would get together 
and knit. The faculty wives in the department. So

14:33.933 --> 14:36.337
that should be spelled K-N-I-T. That's right. And 
those girls are still real close friends. Some of

14:42.826 --> 14:47.012
them moved as far away as Colorado, and they still 
keep up with one another. Let me turn this off a

14:47.252 --> 14:50.337
second. That first fall, Did you and your wife ever 
talk about whether or not you, that this was a good

14:53.984 --> 14:59.753
place to be? Oh, yeah. We, I bet we weren't here two 
weeks. And I came in one day and said, I'm going back

15:08.306 --> 15:11.250
to Southeastern. I just don't fit in here. Health 
really wasn't a high priority in Carl's mind. He

15:20.298 --> 15:22.941
was a physical educator and that's what he was 
pushing. I didn't see that changing real soon. And

15:28.750 --> 15:33.357
I had a real good situation back there. And, of 
course, my wife didn't want to do that at all. She

15:36.694 --> 15:37.576
liked it here. She instantly liked it. And we 
talked about it. Had she been willing to go, I

15:42.063 --> 15:46.249
probably, at the end of that year, would have gone. 
And that would have been the biggest mistake that

15:46.289 --> 15:50.957
I'd ever made at any time. All right. Then what led 
you to change that? One of the big things was

15:53.982 --> 15:55.564
that... at dinner that we talked about. That 
really made a big difference.

16:03.611 --> 16:14.177
But as I got to know Carl better, and as he got to know 
me better, I came to realize he just wanted good

16:03.611 --> 16:14.177
programs. He wasn't going to line up and try to 
develop health. That wasn't his field. But he had

16:19.491 --> 16:24.241
had a long line of folks in that area that had not 
done very good work. And as that got better, I

16:24.261 --> 16:30.192
looked at the university differently. And then I 
got to know, oh, one of the social clubs I joined,

16:30.560 --> 16:40.813
I'm an avid golfer, you probably know that, I 
joined Blackrest, and I got to know a lot of the guys

16:30.560 --> 16:40.813
over there, a lot of the guys in vet medicine. Roy 
England and Fred Heck and, I mean, just Mike Tatum,

16:41.914 --> 16:46.981
just a whole host of them. And I never met anybody 
from that field that weren't just 100% solid

16:47.061 --> 16:52.287
people. And that added to it. But I guess the 
biggest thing was the fact that But I got the

16:58.555 --> 17:03.561
feeling that I could fit in here and it would work. 
Describe how you developed your plans for the

17:03.842 --> 17:11.291
health education program and then how they came to 
become reality. Two things were happening. The

17:13.194 --> 17:24.628
allied health program that I was in charge of, the 
idea behind it was that we needed more allied

17:13.194 --> 17:24.628
health people like medical technologists and 
dental hygienists and physical therapists. But

17:25.630 --> 17:27.432
there weren't enough schools to train them. And 
people who were in those fields wanted to be doing

17:27.884 --> 17:35.914
that kind of work and not teaching because it 
scared them to get out of the doing. They'd lose

17:35.954 --> 17:37.275
their skills. And our role was to identify folks 
who were out in the practice, convince them to come

17:37.956 --> 17:48.829
back and get a master's degree or a doctoral degree 
so they then could take faculty jobs. And early on,

17:49.400 --> 17:51.822
that wasn't going well. I'd go and talk to people, 
and they'd say, well, good luck. But there weren't

17:55.225 --> 17:57.948
many takers then. When I came on board, Carl had 
identified six or eight folks who were going to be

17:57.968 --> 18:04.574
there in September, and none of them showed up. We 
finally, toward the end of the year, we got one

18:04.674 --> 18:10.620
person in who was not a strong student. He was a good 
student, but it was not a good match. It worked out

18:13.963 --> 18:16.225
all right, but it was a difficult one. And it took a 
while to get that going. and primarily it involved

18:19.454 --> 18:28.553
building brochures and mail outs and going to 
professional meetings and visiting and shaking

18:28.752 --> 18:39.868
hands and talking and I guess somewhere around the 
end of that first year, I began to see, I thought it

18:28.752 --> 18:39.868
wasn't gonna happen, it began to happen. And then 
we got a federal grant which paid for some

18:39.888 --> 18:49.321
scholarships, some fellowships actually for 
those folks and that really got it going. Did you

18:49.621 --> 18:50.803
write that proposal? I wrote that proposal and in 
fact hand delivered it up to Washington, which was

18:51.143 --> 18:58.033
another thing that impressed me about A&M. I got a 
lot of help in doing that. There was a lot of

19:00.214 --> 19:07.582
offices, as you know, on campus where people could 
help you build budgets, and here are some things

19:00.214 --> 19:07.582
you shouldn't put in here, and here are things you 
should put in. And like all those deadlines, they

19:08.262 --> 19:10.925
were real tight. And I came down to the wire, and 
they said, well, jump on a plane and take it up

19:11.486 --> 19:15.090
there. And that's what I did. And

19:16.691 --> 19:21.817
not many people got those grants. We were one of, I 
think, five institutions that got them. How many

19:24.700 --> 19:26.061
students did that? That supported... three 
doctoral students, and five master's students

19:28.051 --> 19:32.957
for about five years. And so they began to arrive in 
the fall of? Oh, let's see, this would be 72, 82,

19:38.204 --> 19:42.970
probably 83 is when they started arriving. You say 
80? No, no, 70. I came in 72. 72 was a dry year. 73, I

19:49.979 --> 19:51.741
saw a little 74. 74. Yeah. 1974, I started seeing 
them come in in great numbers. And we had a nucleus

19:57.268 --> 19:58.771
of people. And then it was a matter of just writing a 
letter and responding and treating people like

19:58.811 --> 20:03.719
human beings. And we had it going. As you look back, 
were some of those first students real key people?

20:09.369 --> 20:10.851
We had one guy. His name was Leo Selker that became 
the associate provost at the University of

20:10.891 --> 20:16.120
Chicago, Illinois. We had another. Gerald Boe, 
who became the executive director of NACLS, which

20:18.187 --> 20:22.792
is the professional organization. NACLS, and I 
can't tell you what that is. It's a medical

20:24.414 --> 20:25.976
technology. N-A-K-O-L? N-A-C-L-E-S, NACLS. 
National Association of, and I can't tell you what

20:30.361 --> 20:33.705
it is. We had a woman who became one of the vice 
presidents of Herman Hospital. There were

20:45.338 --> 20:48.102
several really good. Bill Thompson is at Baylor 
College of Medicine now in the Department of

20:48.122 --> 20:52.188
Community Medicine. Just a large number of them 
that did well. And these people were coming

20:56.014 --> 20:59.759
geographically from the South? From all over. 
From all over. Buffalo, New York, Arizona,

21:01.302 --> 21:07.351
Oklahoma.

21:09.494 --> 21:13.540
Not every state in the Union, but there was, we had 
a, and not many local. And who were your allies as

21:14.363 --> 21:20.433
you were trying to build this health program in the 
department? Who were your allies? In the

21:21.835 --> 21:24.279
university, there were no enemies. I mean, nearly 
every place I went, I got help. I wasn't used to

21:27.524 --> 21:29.307
that. I've always been singularly impressed 
about that, about this institution. It's so easy

21:34.255 --> 21:38.262
to build collaborations, or has been until just 
recent years anyway. Don Clark probably helped me

21:38.697 --> 21:44.209
more than anyone because he was associate dean for 
research in the college.

21:47.556 --> 21:50.402
He was my number one person I turned to when I needed 
help. But we had a collaboration with Baylor

21:50.802 --> 21:58.258
College of Medicine at that time and the folks down 
there were helpful also. The

21:58.238 --> 22:09.609
Department of Community Medicine then, they had a 
program in allied health that actually got the

21:58.238 --> 22:09.609
seminal grant in which I was assigned to. At the 
same time that was going on, Robert Hurley was

22:10.129 --> 22:17.637
coordinator of health education and he was 
building an undergraduate degree in health. We

22:17.657 --> 22:18.417
didn't have that. And he and I were sharing an 
office so we would bounce ideas back and forth and

22:19.198 --> 22:24.263
within a year, We had that approved by the 
coordinating board, and that changed things

22:24.530 --> 22:31.877
entirely as far as life as a health educator was 
concerned. It wasn't long until we had 150 majors,

22:32.718 --> 22:37.403
and then that went up to about 300 undergraduate 
majors. So it built pretty quickly. And was this in

22:39.645 --> 22:41.247
the 70s? This would be 74, roughly 74, 73 or 74. 
Let's see

22:45.952 --> 22:52.899
this. No, 73, that was approved. Very good. Was 
there then a true health science major in the

22:56.231 --> 23:03.341
department pretty soon, undergraduate? Yes, 
yes. We got the undergraduate degree first, which

23:05.705 --> 23:09.470
is kind of unusual in health. It has been in reverse 
before. We got the master's and PhD probably in

23:11.914 --> 23:17.842
1978, somewhere along in there. But that meant 
then that we would have health educators majoring

23:23.626 --> 23:27.250
in health, and physical educators majoring in 
physical education. And then there were some

23:27.290 --> 23:28.752
crossover. Some of the physical educators would 
take some health classes. What other

23:33.177 --> 23:39.304
institutions in the Southwest were offering a 
similar, making similar effort at that point? We

23:39.444 --> 23:40.545
were among the first. In the Southwest, I don't 
think there was a single school. No one had a pure

23:46.873 --> 23:48.374
degree. There were some that had a... a program 
that was singled off of physical education, but I

23:51.925 --> 23:56.111
think we were the first ones. I can't think of it. 
Did you have a school somewhere else that was your

23:57.653 --> 24:00.376
model? Tennessee was my model. They had that kind 
of program. Utah was Hurley's model. There were

24:06.965 --> 24:11.992
others, but most of them were in the west and the 
northeast. As this enrollment grew, were you able

24:12.413 --> 24:15.777
to bring in new faculty? We were. Of course, those 
were the growing days of faculty. We were bringing

24:19.302 --> 24:21.645
in one or two faculty every year almost. But when I 
got here, there were three faculty in health.

24:26.494 --> 24:29.717
There's Robert and me and Gail Smith, who was a 
lecturer working on a doctorate. And we have 10 or

24:30.457 --> 24:32.880
11 there now, I think. Physical education had, 
well, they had one, two, three, four, five, six,

24:34.441 --> 24:46.452
seven, eight, and one of those was the department 
head. And I don't know what the head count over

24:46.472 --> 24:48.354
there is now. It's considerably different. All 
right, and as the semesters went on, you started

24:50.887 --> 25:00.434
having a heavier teaching load and a heavier 
leadership responsibility. Did you have any

25:01.075 --> 25:04.525
particular title Were you the... I was the 
coordinator of Allied Health. Coordinator of

25:07.825 --> 25:09.106
Allied Health. That was a departmental title. No 
one else on campus recognized it, but that's where

25:11.009 --> 25:15.614
we distinguished it. And what are some of the other 
courses you began to teach? I continued to teach

25:19.238 --> 25:21.721
the methodology class. I began to teach research 
methods then. And I taught a measurement and

25:25.325 --> 25:27.247
evaluation class. And I taught an Allied Health 
seminar for Allied Health graduates. And I began

25:36.132 --> 25:40.057
to get a lot of 691s, a lot of dissertations. In 
fact, at one time, the Allied Health people were

25:40.838 --> 25:50.189
the only health folks at the doctoral level. And I 
suddenly realized I was carrying a pretty heavy

25:50.789 --> 25:53.993
load there. And so, like all good faculty, I went in 
to ask for some relief. And Carl gave me some

25:58.158 --> 26:00.461
relief, particularly in the summertime. He 
helped me a little bit. Describe some of your

26:02.116 --> 26:10.005
learning experiences as a new thesis and 
dissertation director at AMU. Of course, we have

26:10.025 --> 26:19.315
the model here that you become a co-chair

26:10.025 --> 26:19.315
and then you chair a committee. Well, my first job 
was to co-chair with Carl Landis. And

26:25.285 --> 26:30.071
unfortunately, we had this first Allied Health 
student who was a little bit of a mismatch anyway.

26:30.731 --> 26:33.895
And I pretty quickly learned that co-chair didn't 
mean co-pilot. No, it didn't mean co-chair, but it

26:34.616 --> 26:37.099
meant co-pilot. And so I'm sure I was frustrated 
some part of that time because I felt like that I

26:37.760 --> 26:46.450
knew how to do that. And my ideas were a little 
different than what Carl's ideas were. But in

26:50.697 --> 26:56.864
retrospect, I think it's a good thing, especially 
the steps you have to go through in order to keep the

26:50.697 --> 26:56.864
student out of trouble. I think it was good. Of 
course, George Coonsey played an important role

26:58.967 --> 27:03.392
in that time. I don't know whether this ought to be 
on the tape or not, but I think we lost something

27:03.752 --> 27:09.298
when we lost George Coonsey. Oh, no. See, those are 
the kind of things we do want to know. Why did you

27:12.991 --> 27:15.374
think so highly? What was good about his? What I 
liked was what some people didn't like. He

27:19.560 --> 27:22.964
expected everyone to adhere to a certain 
standard. And when you didn't adhere to that

27:23.846 --> 27:27.310
standard, then he bucked it back to you. And you had 
to get it in shape before it came back to it. Well, it

27:31.636 --> 27:35.341
seems now that just almost anything goes. Before 
we did final defenses, we had to have the thing on

27:36.443 --> 27:39.707
blue line. Now it's a rough draft that I look at 
often when I go to a final defense and more rough

27:40.345 --> 27:47.835
than anything else. And he didn't pull punches. He 
didn't mind looking you in the eye and telling you

27:51.880 --> 27:55.725
this is what he thought. And I like that guy. He 
saved me an awful lot when I was department head,

27:57.887 --> 28:05.577
but he helped me an awful lot when I was a faculty 
member too. As the 70s are moving along, did you and

28:06.248 --> 28:13.316
your colleagues feel like progress was being 
made? Oh, yeah. I thought, in a lot of ways, the 70s

28:15.179 --> 28:19.464
were the Camelot years for us. When I came here, I 
was taken by how much obvious devotion there was

28:20.445 --> 28:29.195
between faculty and students. Students often 
would praise a faculty member and talk about, how

28:36.083 --> 28:37.765
they felt about them. And former students would 
talk about how much they actually loved some of

28:37.785 --> 28:42.231
their faculty. And faculty, when they talked 
about students, would do likewise. In fact, more

28:45.775 --> 28:52.283
than once I'd go in the office and one that I 
remember best was Homer Tolson that we talked

28:45.775 --> 28:52.283
about earlier. He had a needlepoint on his wall 
that said, students come first in this office

28:52.303 --> 28:58.671
always. And he meant that. If I came in as a faculty 
member and he had a student and I tried to interrupt

28:59.853 --> 29:03.357
that He let me know very quickly that he wasn't 
available right then. In a lot of ways, I thought we

29:07.901 --> 29:13.646
met our mission in those years as well as we ever 
have. But yes, no question, we were making

29:14.466 --> 29:18.230
headway. We were being hamstrung to some degree by 
the growth of the place. We were always behind the

29:22.694 --> 29:26.657
curve in terms of facilities and those kind of 
things. Now, did you ever in those early years have

29:27.718 --> 29:33.563
any male-female situations in class where the... 
where the Aggie male didn't want the Aggie female

29:33.863 --> 29:37.727
there? I never did. I never did. I know it happened 
some in the Corps. I know we had some difficulty in

29:42.112 --> 29:45.535
integrating the band with women. But I never did in 
our department. In fact, I can remember as

29:47.978 --> 29:55.866
department head getting an enrollment report one 
time, and this was like the mid-'80s. And I looked

29:56.327 --> 30:01.272
at it and I said, Linda, Linda was my secretary, 
we've got more women than we have men in this

29:56.327 --> 30:01.272
department. She says, no, we don't. We counted up, 
and we were 10 or 15 more women than men. And that

30:06.746 --> 30:08.007
slipped up on us. I didn't realize it happened. I 
don't think we had any problem with that,

30:09.588 --> 30:13.552
certainly not in classrooms. What about ethnic 
diversity? It wasn't very much then. It wasn't

30:17.536 --> 30:19.498
very much ethnic diversity then. But do you 
remember any problems with Hispanic students? I

30:24.342 --> 30:25.343
didn't remember any. I think what happened 
occurred out in the and then formal settings. Of

30:32.589 --> 30:44.510
course, in our classes, in our physical education 
activity classes, that's where integration

30:32.589 --> 30:44.510
occurred best because everyone was equal there 
and the best skilled one got the ball the most. In

30:44.911 --> 30:48.036
the classrooms, I didn't see any sign of it. But we 
just, in our field, It's kind of a unique thing

30:50.594 --> 30:52.816
about ethnic diversity. We didn't have many 
minorities who came into our field because they

30:52.896 --> 31:00.223
were good enough to go to college. They often 
elected a business or liberal arts often, and they

31:00.803 --> 31:09.071
didn't just elect our program. Even though most 
people on campus thought that most of the athletes

31:09.651 --> 31:16.157
came to our department, that wasn't true for the 
most part. We had to recruit. blacks to get them in

31:18.826 --> 31:20.368
our faculty. We had to actually work at getting 
that and I was I'm kind of proud of the fact that I

31:20.388 --> 31:26.778
hired the first one and that's after I became 
department head. All right now we'll want to work

31:26.798 --> 31:29.622
that in a little bit. In those early years do you 
remember any realities with athletes in class?

31:36.872 --> 31:40.277
You don't have to name names.
