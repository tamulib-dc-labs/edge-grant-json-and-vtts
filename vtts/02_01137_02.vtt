WEBVTT

00:03.305 --> 00:12.493
OK.

00:03.305 --> 00:12.493
My name is Richard Brown, and I'm senior vice 
president of planning for the Woodlands

00:03.305 --> 00:12.493
Corporation. It's almost 1991, and I've spent the 
last 16 years here full time overseeing the real

00:13.814 --> 00:32.670
estate portfolio of Mitchell from the planning 
strategy and implementation phase, most of that

00:33.410 --> 00:37.576
time being spent on the new town called the 
Woodlands. I came here with a career that included

00:39.258 --> 01:00.067
25 years of running my own consulting 
professional firm of planners, engineers, and

00:39.258 --> 01:00.067
architects, which had, when I left, five offices, 
New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Atlanta,

00:39.258 --> 01:00.067
Georgia, Baton Rouge, Louisiana. And we 
specialized in a broad spectrum of professional

01:03.346 --> 01:11.017
services, but my real love was new community 
planning and development. I started my career in

01:11.578 --> 01:23.616
the early 50s as a professional engineer, 
broadening into urban planning and

01:11.578 --> 01:23.616
architecture, and became a consultant to many 
communities, both for their planning boards and

01:24.288 --> 01:34.583
governing bodies, as well as servicing the real 
estate development industry in a wide variety of

01:24.288 --> 01:34.583
projects from industrial development. How did 
you get into the new community concept or

01:34.603 --> 01:39.630
framework of things? I was retained by the Rouse 
Company to do the planning and engineering on a

01:39.650 --> 01:51.207
regional shopping mall in Willowbrook, New 
Jersey, called Willowbrook in Wayne, New Jersey.

01:51.743 --> 02:10.523
And in the process of that project, they announced 
to me that they had bought 11,000 acres in Maryland

01:51.743 --> 02:10.523
between Baltimore and Washington to do a new city, 
and wondered if I would come down and take a look at

01:51.743 --> 02:10.523
what they thought they wanted to do, since up to 
that point, they were regional moral developers.

02:11.083 --> 02:21.514
But Jim Rouse had an idea that suburban sprawl 
communities were not the best way to develop this

02:11.083 --> 02:21.514
nation. new communities were. And I went down 
there in 1965. Excuse me, how would you define a new

02:26.715 --> 02:32.664
community from that framework then or now, if 
there's any difference? Well, I think up until

02:32.744 --> 02:44.683
then and still prevailing today, the development 
industry are really geared up to be what I call

02:32.744 --> 02:44.683
shelter builders. They build houses, and your 
Sunday real estate section is full of houses. And

02:48.996 --> 02:51.919
they sell living rooms and ceiling fans and back 
decks. And the thrust really is the shelter

02:51.959 --> 02:56.966
they're selling. There's very few people who are 
community builders. A community builder not only

02:59.929 --> 03:13.827
provides a shelter, but he takes on the 
responsibility of providing a high quality of

02:59.929 --> 03:13.827
life for those residents to encompass all 
opportunities that are possible. to create an

03:14.093 --> 03:22.164
environment where people can live good lives and 
cover a broad cross-section of housing. Most

03:22.184 --> 03:27.011
subdivisions and developments are pretty 
monolithic in their price structure. New

03:27.672 --> 03:40.410
community attempts to have housing for the very 
poor, the very rich, and everybody in between in

03:27.672 --> 03:40.410
accordance with some economic demographic 
profile so that you have the vibrant mixture of

03:27.672 --> 03:40.410
people. And that's what new communities do. try to 
provide the retail and employment components of

03:44.215 --> 03:49.121
life also in the project. And that's part of the 
inception of the whole community plan? The

03:52.224 --> 03:59.553
conception of the plan is that you shouldn't have 
to spend one or two hours a day out of your life

03:52.224 --> 03:59.553
commuting to and from work. It would be great if you 
could get there in two to three minutes, which is

03:59.853 --> 04:05.239
the way I've lived for the last 30 years. Because 
I've lived in new towns since the early 60s. And I

04:10.685 --> 04:13.108
guess I've lost touch with what the real world is 
like. It's all right. That's all right. All right.

04:19.924 --> 04:26.958
So you were developing, you had become 
affiliated, I guess, with the new community town

04:19.924 --> 04:26.958
concept. Yeah, the Rouse Company asked me to come 
down, and after a few days of discussions, I was put

04:26.998 --> 04:34.472
in charge of, taking the conceptual plans and 
doing the hard line planning, the engineering,

04:36.258 --> 04:49.351
the county approvals that were necessary, take 
the bids, get the development built for the

04:36.258 --> 04:49.351
opening. So I was headed for that. That was a 
tremendous career. Yeah, it was a wonderful

04:52.655 --> 04:54.737
experience. How old were you then, roughly? I was 
in my, I guess, early 40s or late 30s.

05:05.992 --> 05:11.577
It was a wonderful experience to start with a clean 
slate and say, you know, where do the roads go?

05:11.617 --> 05:14.560
Where should the neighborhoods be? What is the 
fabric of community? What kind of an

05:16.782 --> 05:21.987
infrastructure should you have from the physical 
side as well as the social side? Can we take the

05:22.868 --> 05:32.657
experiences we've had and weave together a 
community that serves its people? I could mention

05:32.958 --> 05:41.087
that for a number of years I was mayor of a town in New 
Jersey undergoing very rapid growth. We're

05:41.327 --> 05:43.189
getting 3,000 building permits a year. And I knew 
all the problems of trying to provide libraries

05:43.830 --> 05:52.419
and recreation and public works expansions and 
services for a growing population. That was a

05:52.499 --> 05:54.301
great piece of experience. I think that was 
incredible. It really was. I bet very few

05:55.702 --> 05:57.745
architects have had that side. That's correct. So 
that was an in-depth. training session to help

06:02.506 --> 06:08.154
prepare me for new community development work, 
which is really what I love to do. And then how did

06:09.737 --> 06:12.140
the Texas Connection develop? After we got 
Columbia, Maryland open, the Routes Company had

06:13.522 --> 06:24.138
wanted me to stay on, but I had my own company, as I 
mentioned. I had taken a sabbatical for a year and a

06:24.218 --> 06:31.028
half to get Columbia open, so I said no. We expanded 
our activity in the new community field, and I

06:32.054 --> 06:41.068
think we did six or seven of the 12 or 13 HUD 
community projects. Flower Man was one. St.

06:42.650 --> 06:43.872
Charles was another.

06:47.298 --> 06:49.181
Ganonda was a third. We did Peachtree City, but at 
the last minute, they decided to stay private. And

06:55.691 --> 06:56.252
of course, we did that. That was in Georgia. That 
was in Atlanta. Yeah, southwest of Atlanta.

07:00.151 --> 07:02.114
That's still doing very nicely now. But the other 
HUD communities didn't make it, basically. No,

07:07.260 --> 07:10.144
they didn't make it for predetermined reasons. 
They had weak, inexperienced sponsors, not

07:10.184 --> 07:14.169
enough staying power financially. They were in 
poor locations where the markets were not strong.

07:18.355 --> 07:21.199
To build it in town, you need a great location. You 
need to be on Interstate Highway, which the

07:21.459 --> 07:24.383
Williams did. You need to be near a major airport, 
which it is. You need to be near an urban center

07:26.386 --> 07:29.770
that's expanding and has dynamic... vitality 
which houston does and so all the things will work

07:29.952 --> 07:58.052
you need a patient strong sponsor that can stand 
the deep investments that it takes the first 10

07:29.952 --> 07:58.052
years before you turn profitable a few people are 
committed to do that yeah they're all looking for a

07:29.952 --> 07:58.052
quick return every quarter yeah the bank wants you 
to borrow the money and return it that same year it

07:29.952 --> 07:58.052
takes a long time to develop these projects, it's 
nothing to think in terms of 20, 30, 40 years. But

08:04.023 --> 08:11.234
anyway, George Mitchell came to Columbia, 
Maryland, and visited me at my office there. I was

08:12.315 --> 08:13.697
pretty well known. I guess that was in 68, 69. and 
invited me down here to take a look at this

08:17.287 --> 08:19.510
property. I wonder who led him to you. Do you know, 
or other than just your reputation? No, I think it

08:23.614 --> 08:25.437
was the Columbia. Columbia had the reputation. It 
was the first new town on the East Coast, and when

08:26.778 --> 08:43.598
they came and found out that I had my role in it, and 
that I was a consulting firm with an office right

08:26.778 --> 08:43.598
there in the American City building in downtown 
Columbia, it was logical to continue. on and was a

08:44.287 --> 08:49.913
good source of potential clients and so forth. So 
George then retained my firm to come down and help.

08:54.177 --> 08:57.281
What did you think about his idea, that initial 
conversation? Do you remember any aspect of that?

09:00.865 --> 09:13.618
Yeah, I remember him asking me what it took to do a 
new town, and I told him it took a whole host of

09:00.865 --> 09:13.618
disciplines, engineers, planners, architects, 
economists, market people. and a commitment for

09:14.206 --> 09:19.051
long-term investment and so forth. And he said, 
OK. And I'm prepared to do all that. And so I became a

09:25.578 --> 09:29.082
consultant to the project. And just like with the 
Routes Company, when that was done, he said, well,

09:29.102 --> 09:34.248
why don't you stay on? And again, I said no and went 
away to do Peachtree City for Pipps Land Company,

09:35.169 --> 09:42.897
which I did for a year. including some work in 
Florida. But I kept getting phone calls. Why don't

09:46.998 --> 09:47.659
you come back? Why don't you come back? So when 
there was a break in major projects, I agreed to

09:48.520 --> 09:56.433
come back for a month and take a look. And at the end 
of that 30 days, I decided to stay. Oh, was that

09:58.616 --> 09:59.197
right? This was in the fall of 1974. But now, you had 
been here earlier than in 72? Well, I was here in 70,

10:07.432 --> 10:11.118
71, 72 when we did the planning. Then I went away for 
two years. Is this basic structure your

10:13.041 --> 10:19.310
conception, pretty much, the layout of the 
villages? Well, let me say, to be totally fair,

10:20.372 --> 10:27.182
there was a team of people involved. Robert 
Gladstone did the market studies economic

10:30.650 --> 10:37.044
reports which have a strong bearing on what you 
build because there's a market there to buy it. We

10:38.346 --> 10:44.760
had McCard here from the University of 
Pennsylvania who was an environmentalist who

10:38.346 --> 10:44.760
hammered home the preservation of the forest 
concept and the forest preserves, which really is

10:45.230 --> 10:49.595
our signature. And we still respect a lot of what he 
said, some of which we had to change.

10:57.504 --> 11:02.769
Nevertheless,

10:57.504 --> 11:02.769
he had a very positive influence. And then William 
Pereira, an architect on the West Coast. George

11:06.113 --> 11:09.317
used to say, well, we've got the best from the West 
Coast and the best from the East Coast. And Richard

11:10.098 --> 11:12.300
Brown, associate, and he William Carrera got 
together, and we had numerous workshops over the

11:12.550 --> 11:22.829
year doing concept planning, master planning. 
And we tried a lot of things. We tried linear plans.

11:25.434 --> 11:28.119
We tried historic gridiron patterns. And in the 
end, I think the Columbia model proved to be the

11:32.277 --> 11:39.346
most viable, which was a series of residential 
villages and a very strong employment corridor

11:32.277 --> 11:39.346
along I-45. Your initial plan, what was the 
acreage? Was it 7,000? 17,000. 17,000, yeah. It's

11:45.273 --> 11:46.674
25 now. But it was 17 at that time. When I came back 
full time, one of the first things I did was lobby,

11:49.117 --> 11:58.208
pick up that next 8,000 acres all the way out to 
2978, which was a major acquisition. But George

11:58.809 --> 12:00.411
became convinced. If we didn't do that, by the way, 
we'd be nearing the end of this project by now.

12:06.646 --> 12:11.933
Because we needed that to grow.

12:11.953 --> 12:15.137
So you come back here then in 74.

12:16.619 --> 12:19.783
And that was kind of a tenuous time. Yeah, oil 
shortages were coming on and the economy was flat

12:20.765 --> 12:30.077
and it was tough getting going. By energy going up, 
they could afford to bridge the gap of deficit

12:30.378 --> 12:38.648
years until the project would turn profitable. 
What intrigued you about coming here, say,

12:38.788 --> 12:43.134
instead of going to another project somewhere 
else? Well, I think it was, frankly, the biggest

12:43.735 --> 12:47.259
project. I really believed that it had all the 
components for success, as I mentioned, on a state

12:48.941 --> 12:57.111
highway near a growing metropolitan area. the 
largest in the country at that time, near a major

12:57.952 --> 13:02.937
airport. So those compounds were there. George's 
personal commitment to me that this was not a get in

13:04.759 --> 13:11.346
and get out kind of a project. He was going to see it 
through. They were going to fund it. And the thing

13:14.309 --> 13:26.541
that appealed to me most of all the sponsors of New 
Towns, most of them were either in the real estate

13:14.309 --> 13:26.541
business or some other affiliated business, but 
nobody had such a strong main business. I think

13:29.171 --> 13:37.340
Mitchell's energy division, and we used to say, 
you know, Mitchell is 80% energy and 20% real

13:29.171 --> 13:37.340
estate. So real estate's very cyclonic. If you're 
going into a project that's going to take 30 years,

13:40.823 --> 13:46.890
there's going to be good times, there's going to be 
bad times, there's going to be good times, there's

13:40.823 --> 13:46.890
going to be bad times. It's going to go up and down 
two or three times a decade. And if that's all you

13:49.753 --> 13:53.997
do, when you hit those troughs, you're in a lot of 
trouble. I saw the energy division as the means to

13:54.567 --> 14:02.478
bridge those gaps, where when things are good, we 
break it all in. When things get bad, we've got the

14:02.838 --> 14:05.963
staying power. I never would have sold my company, 
you know, just to come out of purely real estate

14:06.543 --> 14:11.771
companies. I know they're so flaky. They don't 
have the staying power when you hit a recession.

14:18.079 --> 14:21.604
But since it was a minor part of the company's 
business, you know, I figured that gave it a

14:22.124 --> 14:27.612
stability that most real estate companies don't 
have. It's a very important thing. And people will

14:30.136 --> 14:34.442
admit, if you look back, that if it weren't for 
energy, we wouldn't have produced some of the gas.

14:35.844 --> 14:43.696
And then, of course, we had the double whammy in the 
mid-'80s, when both energy and real estate went

14:35.844 --> 14:43.696
down, and we had some tough sledding. But now, both 
of them up again. I think it's going to work out all

14:46.921 --> 14:48.363
right. I think that... Do you think, 
incidentally, that... Right now, it's

14:51.757 --> 14:59.025
comparable in any way, say, to the mid-'70s when 
things began to recycle again. You know, the

14:59.045 --> 15:02.189
energy oil went up and building... I like to think 
that we've learned something from that and we

15:02.209 --> 15:07.015
aren't going to go... I think they'll find a 
solution in the next 6 to 12 months in the Middle

15:07.175 --> 15:13.482
East. It'll be a compromise that will moderate 
things back to, I think, where it will stay...

15:18.757 --> 15:28.346
between $20 and $30 a barrel, and maybe $25, where I 
think it's a healthy thing for the energy

15:18.757 --> 15:28.346
companies, but not a depressant on the rest of the 
world economy. And I think that's very important.

15:31.669 --> 15:32.831
But I think that will happen. And instead of having 
the kind of crazy boom they had in the late 70s that

15:32.851 --> 15:44.502
only could foresee a collapse that happened, 
hopefully that won't happen again. Now, when NAD

15:48.524 --> 15:50.427
See, I may be jumping your head too far. But in 82, 
that's about the time you begin to hit the slide

15:51.849 --> 15:56.315
again in the Woodlands. What are you doing now? I 
mean, can you sort of reconstruct that particular

15:58.218 --> 16:01.422
period? You've been in the Boone, and now what 
happens is basically through the 80s. Well, we

16:06.309 --> 16:07.911
reduced staff. Our planning department used to be 
18. It went back to six. It was a time to tighten

16:11.837 --> 16:17.485
belts and to try to... survive what everybody 
said, what you know. Because we know,

16:23.337 --> 16:25.600
historically, it's cyclonic. When things are 
bad, they don't stay bad. They will change.

16:28.343 --> 16:30.004
They'll either get worse or they'll get better. 
And we knew it would get better. And sure enough, it

16:32.507 --> 16:35.170
did. And the thing that happened, which was very 
surprising but very enlightening, as the real

16:35.190 --> 16:47.303
estate market shrunk as far as demand goes in 
Houston, so did The development industries

16:47.992 --> 16:50.435
shrink. And the subdivision developers, the 
shelter builders, as I said, the people who didn't

16:50.455 --> 16:59.286
build communities, their projects died 
illegally. And what happened where the

16:59.666 --> 17:17.408
Newtown-type projects, which the Woodlands fits 
the Newtown definition the best, but there are

16:59.666 --> 17:17.408
others that are similar but not quite as complete, 
like the King Woods and the First Colonies and the

16:59.666 --> 17:17.408
Copperfields, those planned communities, which 
fortunately ring Clear Lake City, ring Houston,

17:18.164 --> 17:39.184
and that's an important point to mention later, 
those communities which had been getting between

17:18.164 --> 17:39.184
5 and 7 percent of the market share during the good 
times wound up getting 50 to 55 percent of the

17:18.164 --> 17:39.184
market share. So while the pie got smaller, the new 
community project share of that pie got bigger and

17:39.624 --> 17:45.209
bigger. So we didn't suffer the total collapse 
that the individual subdivision developers saw.

17:52.643 --> 18:00.692
And that was largely because of the builders or 
whatever lost their financing, was it, do you

17:52.643 --> 18:00.692
think? That's probably part of it, but also I think 
that the marketplace began to understand and

18:01.933 --> 18:12.285
perceive that a new community environment Was it 
better protection for their real estate

18:12.907 --> 18:19.094
investment than somebody's bedroom in the 
subdivision? Right, somebody's gridiron

18:19.815 --> 18:35.674
bedroom community project that didn't have the 
recreation, social, cultural, entertainment,

18:19.815 --> 18:35.674
and employment opportunities where the quality 
of life wasn't assured because of the

18:19.815 --> 18:35.674
completeness of the program and the plan. And then 
that was traditional Texas, Houston

18:35.694 --> 18:41.260
construction style until the advent of 
equipment. across the whole country. And I'm not

18:43.029 --> 18:56.082
trying to compare anything unfavorably, but 
Friendswood, I guess, would have been the largest

18:43.029 --> 18:56.082
developer in the south part of town in that style. 
Clear Lake City. Clear Lake City, right. Are they

18:58.344 --> 19:01.847
moving more into your style of development now, 
you think? No, I don't think so. I think everyone

19:04.870 --> 19:11.196
has their own program.

19:11.851 --> 19:20.486
Our biggest competitor, because the two of us are 
the north side of town, their villages are

19:11.851 --> 19:20.486
economically very monolithic. This village, if 
you want a price range house, $150,000 to

19:22.089 --> 19:26.978
$200,000, you live in that village. If you want an 
$80,000 house, you live in another village. Where

19:30.624 --> 19:36.795
the woodlands, we have the dynamics of a complete 
socioeconomic mixed formula for the whole

19:30.624 --> 19:36.795
village. And we get more vitality and reality to 
the population that way. And we put 12,000 to

19:41.498 --> 19:48.028
16,000, 18,000 people per village to serve as a 
village center. Kingwood just does residential

19:48.088 --> 19:51.995
pods, and they call them villages, but they're 
not. We try to have a village center and school

19:52.155 --> 20:04.234
system, short of high school, in each village, 
complete parks and pathway systems for each

19:52.155 --> 20:04.234
village, complete variety of housing in each 
village. So people are triggered to have a sense of

20:04.754 --> 20:09.459
allegiance and place in the village they live in. 
And then we do a village in four to five, six years.

20:13.583 --> 20:19.288
We're done with it, and we're on to another 
village, and these people aren't in the

20:13.583 --> 20:19.288
construction mess anymore. And we can take 30 
years, and we aren't pestering everybody with 30

20:20.289 --> 20:28.778
years worth of construction activity around 
their ears, because we do a village at a time. They

20:29.839 --> 20:32.922
overlap, of course. So you survived the slump, 
basically, by, in part, contracting some of your

20:33.188 --> 20:40.417
activities. But also, your share of the pie is 
getting larger. And we're talking about 82, 83

20:43.621 --> 20:46.724
more pie, and so forth. What are you doing now in 
terms of planning? Is there any kind of

20:49.227 --> 20:54.854
redirection or reconstitution of your thoughts 
and directions? Well, only those that I think come

20:54.874 --> 20:59.059
from the maturing of the project.

21:01.222 --> 21:02.824
And I think that... you understand our master plan 
we have a 5 000 acre business complex along the i-45

21:04.070 --> 21:25.690
corridor there hasn't been much said about it uh i 
don't think if you ask people downtown about the

21:04.070 --> 21:25.690
woodlands they would immediately talk about 
housing and that segment of it they think of it as a

21:04.070 --> 21:25.690
business community Yet the Woodlands has 5,000 
acre business complex, which makes it one of the

21:26.311 --> 21:36.286
largest master plan business complex in the 
southwestern part of the United States. We have a

21:36.306 --> 21:39.530
rail served industrial park at the trade center. 
We have a commercial area for light

21:39.550 --> 21:43.456
manufacturing. We have the research forest for 
high tech. We have the town center, which will be

21:45.940 --> 21:49.585
the urban core. 5,000 acres will someday have 
100,000 jobs and 30, 40 million square feet of

21:50.071 --> 22:00.387
development there, and it will be the hub of a 
million people by the year 2000. That million

22:01.929 --> 22:08.038
people is the primary market area of the town 
center and the business complex of the Woodlands.

22:08.259 --> 22:13.887
How many of that million will be housed actually in 
the Woodlands, let's say? Will that be the

22:13.907 --> 22:14.808
Woodlands? That will all be in the Woodlands. 
Okay. Right. and that is the maturing of this

22:18.590 --> 22:48.208
region and that's what we're getting into the 
planning of now which you really couldn't think

22:18.590 --> 22:48.208
seriously about until you built up this base of 30 
to 50 000 people here now the rest of it starts to

22:18.590 --> 22:48.208
come along and i think by the year 2000 we will have a 
business complex the town center particularly

22:18.590 --> 22:48.208
will start to take shape that will be the envy of any 
urban center It'll be a satellite city to Houston,

22:48.897 --> 22:56.665
and it will be a downtown in the forest. We'll have 
the amenities of culture, and education, and

22:56.685 --> 23:09.878
services, and shopping, and jobs that are in close 
proximity to the primary labor force in the area.

23:10.059 --> 23:18.347
And I hope that that will really complete the 
spectrum that I consider the Woodlands.

23:19.981 --> 23:23.727
And I think, you know, you don't start off doing 
that. That can only come after the population in

23:23.747 --> 23:33.422
the region starts to mature, and we're within a 
year or two of reaching those kind of numbers. Now,

23:33.442 --> 23:36.226
the Mall is intrinsic to that. The Mall is one of 
those major building blocks or cornerstones of

23:36.546 --> 23:42.175
the town center. A mall will not be viable unless 
there's 275 or 325,000 people within the primary

23:42.391 --> 23:49.742
market area. And the arithmetic is now there. So 
we're on the verge of being able to start that mall

23:52.586 --> 23:59.396
and bring it on stream in the next probably 24 
months. In developing this kind of, I won't call it

23:59.776 --> 24:10.812
an urban complex, but certainly a highly large 
population in a small area, What does this do to

24:11.180 --> 24:15.425
your environmental concerns in the woodlands? 
How do you manage that? Is there a special plan? In

24:17.868 --> 24:25.657
other words, when you put the mall down in the 
woodlands, how do you accommodate that to the

24:17.868 --> 24:25.657
style that you've already developed? Is there 
difficulty here? Well, any large project, such as

24:29.121 --> 24:39.533
a mall, requires a lot of earth moving, which of 
itself destroys a lot of trees. uh but you have to

24:40.475 --> 25:05.773
have parking lots that enter at the second level 
can be two of them all but we will have site planning

24:40.475 --> 25:05.773
and architectural control of the design and 
development of this such that we will

24:40.475 --> 25:05.773
re-establish the forest in the parking lots and 
around the perimeter of the mall so that it still

24:40.475 --> 25:05.773
reads like the woodlands and not like uh some of 
your other yeah that's what that's the only You

25:06.142 --> 25:09.146
know, 90 acres of concrete parking lots, period. 
But you've certainly done that with the

25:09.166 --> 25:11.889
commercial buildings, even like your building. 
You have to really walk through the trees to find

25:11.949 --> 25:16.294
the building. It's kind of fun. Man is a creature of 
the forest, which, you know, it's another

25:18.697 --> 25:24.023
dimension which I think is worth mentioning. When 
I started work at Columbia, Maryland, and then

25:25.064 --> 25:33.955
these other new towns started following, there 
was a point in time when I think if you added up our

25:34.846 --> 25:42.294
client list, we had over 100,000 acres worth of new 
community projects, which potentially could

25:34.846 --> 25:42.294
house a million people. And I said, you know, this 
is serious work. If you have the audacity to think

25:46.419 --> 25:57.391
you're going to build an environment for a million 
people, you really need to know something about

25:46.419 --> 25:57.391
people. So up until that point, most of the concern 
was economics, market share. sewer capacity,

26:04.951 --> 26:10.096
water capacity, highway access, the hardware 
issues. Nobody was asking questions about, what

26:10.977 --> 26:15.922
about the user? And I got involved at that point in 
personal research into cultural anthropology

26:15.942 --> 26:29.796
and social behavioral science in order to 
understand better what communities were all

26:15.942 --> 26:29.796
about. I took eight trips to Europe and studied 
various countries, their human settlements,

26:33.082 --> 26:37.229
their villages, their towns. I wrote to Robert 
Ardrey's publisher in London and got invited to go

26:38.350 --> 27:00.726
to Rome where he was living and review with him for a 
week what someone who was a master at human

26:38.350 --> 27:00.726
behavior and social contract and the territorial 
imperative of people, what that could mean to the

26:38.350 --> 27:00.726
planning of new communities. And as a result of 
that time, we became very good friends. And I spent

27:04.204 --> 27:20.465
a lot of time in organizations and with authors who 
were mostly in academic situations studying

27:04.204 --> 27:20.465
about people and trying to quantify what it is they 
needed to lead successful lives and how that could

27:04.204 --> 27:20.465
impact the physical environment. And for 
example, we found that in order to satisfy people,

27:21.686 --> 27:30.257
they come with one pre-wired genetic 
propensities, which are just evolutionary in

27:30.862 --> 27:36.348
their character. And second is the cultural 
imprinting of the environment they grew up in and

27:36.388 --> 27:42.415
the personal circumstances. And that part, we 
didn't have much control about where people were

27:43.656 --> 27:50.183
coming from or whether their parents were good or 
bad. There was enough psychiatrists out there and

27:51.765 --> 27:54.969
counselors to work on that. But certainly, we 
could understand more about the basic needs of

27:55.009 --> 27:58.793
people. And I came up with some simplistic ways of 
defining that for management by SIS. First S stood

28:09.125 --> 28:10.626
for security. All people yearn for security. 
People that didn't worry about security aren't

28:14.011 --> 28:18.136
here anymore. So that became an overriding 
tendency of people. And you find it in the gated

28:21.460 --> 28:23.903
communities. You find it in just the entrance 
statements, which are made to look like a gate.

28:28.017 --> 28:29.780
That says, when I get in there, I'm safe. That's a 
subtle appeal to man's innate need for security.

28:36.310 --> 28:44.101
So we've organized the planning in the woodland so 
about 75% of all the single-family homes are on

28:36.310 --> 28:44.101
cul-de-sac courts. A single point of entry, a 
defensible space. The arithmetic of that group is

28:48.288 --> 28:55.138
such that it reinforces friendliness and a sense 
of security that they're not with strangers.

28:58.055 --> 29:00.478
There are friends and acquaintances there. 
They're devoid of through traffic, so it's safer

29:00.979 --> 29:04.123
for the kids. That's a whole sense of identity 
there, which is also the second point, which is

29:04.384 --> 29:11.514
personal identity. People can be in big cities and 
they're lost because they don't have any contact

29:11.534 --> 29:17.703
with their neighbors. You hear about it in New 
York. People live in an apartment. In 20 years,

29:21.248 --> 29:24.012
they never said hello to their neighbor in the next 
apartment. We wanted to create a situation where

29:24.818 --> 29:30.927
people would feel free to intermingle and 
interact. And the arithmetic of the group became

29:30.947 --> 29:33.831
very important. So that's why I recreated that in 
the cul-de-sac developments in New Orleans. That

29:40.300 --> 29:49.333
number, not coincidentally, is the same number 
that the average hunting primate troop. Is that

29:49.353 --> 29:50.014
right? It existed for two million years and 
tramped around this planet. That's the same

29:54.721 --> 29:56.564
arithmetic. Out of that kind of a group, you come up 
with five to ten able-bodied men, and the rest are

29:56.624 --> 30:06.098
children and women and older people and whatever. 
And that five to ten able-bodied men happens to be

30:06.678 --> 30:20.138
the size of a baseball team and a football team and a 
basketball team, where instead of going out on the

30:06.678 --> 30:20.138
hunt with these able-bodied men, they've now got 
to organize team sports. to replace that

30:20.354 --> 30:24.118
stimulation, which is an exciting question. 
Stimulation. That's great. You can't have a

30:25.219 --> 30:31.225
bedroom community that's dull and monotonous if 
you're going to build a new community. So we built

30:31.365 --> 30:33.207
in festivals. No matter where I went and studied 
human civilization, back to the early towns in

30:33.227 --> 30:44.398
Mesopotamia 10,000 years ago, they all had 
amphitheaters. They all had theater and music.

30:48.262 --> 30:49.483
And we've worked hard. And that's why for the last 
10 years I worked hard to convince George that we

30:49.700 --> 30:54.605
needed this music pavilion. And finally got 
funded to get the darn thing built. And I was the

30:58.309 --> 31:07.378
project director on that that just opened last 
April, which was such a sense of accomplishment

30:58.309 --> 31:07.378
for me after 10 years of working hard on that. And it 
builds a niche. People need stimulation. As I

31:13.584 --> 31:17.428
mentioned, the creatures of the forest and these 
studies The Woodlands is probably the only place

31:19.113 --> 31:29.425
that I know of in the United States where you can 
consistently travel through the forest on

31:19.113 --> 31:29.425
pathways that we've built, the hiking bike trail 
system. Presently, over 54 miles of hiking bike

31:29.986 --> 31:33.670
trails in the Woodlands. It's recreating an old 
trick. People love it. Post-occupancy

31:37.615 --> 31:42.460
interviewing says, what do you like most about the 
Woodlands? The statement comes up first, the

31:42.500 --> 31:45.564
pathways. The walk. They don't know. I'm telling 
you, it recreates a pathway through the forest

31:48.155 --> 31:56.564
trip on foot or on bicycle or jogging. Something in 
the midbrain is saying, gee, this is the way it

31:57.325 --> 32:00.689
always was. This is great. This is relaxing. This 
is natural. And if you're not in a forest, you bring

32:05.033 --> 32:13.002
it into your office or you bring the secretaries 
the plants on their desk. I mean, there's an

32:13.022 --> 32:15.985
affinity between man and nature that can't be 
denied. The Fares doesn't make people feel

32:16.302 --> 32:20.427
insecure or unsafe. Well, it's the way it's always 
been. This company, for example, if you're

32:22.490 --> 32:26.155
president, you get three trees in your office. If 
you're senior vice president, you're entitled to

32:26.175 --> 32:28.618
two. If you're state president, you get one. If 
you're secretary, you bring your own pots and

32:30.200 --> 32:35.066
plants home and put it on your desk. But that and 
flowers, I mean, the evidence is all around us. You

32:38.671 --> 32:42.175
open it up and look, and then you try and reinforce 
that. Festivals was the other thing. We have

32:45.196 --> 32:54.649
festivals here, the Harvest Festival, the Fourth 
of July Festival, and sports festival events,

32:45.196 --> 32:54.649
like the Houston Open and swimming meets. There's 
always something for people to be anticipating.

32:58.534 --> 33:06.405
Sometimes the anticipation is more fun than the 
actual event, but you're adding some spice to life

32:58.534 --> 33:06.405
to say, boy, I can't wait until next Saturday 
night. So-and-so is going to be at the pavilion, or

33:06.625 --> 33:12.533
we're going to have a golf tournament, or we're 
going to have a tennis tournament, or something

33:06.625 --> 33:12.533
else is happening. And that, I think, is what the 
marketplace is beginning to respond to. We're not

33:18.207 --> 33:19.690
just building shelter. We've surrounded people 
with a quality of life here that they can't find

33:20.170 --> 33:27.341
anywhere else in Houston or probably in the 
country. In the few short years we've been here,

33:27.361 --> 33:34.732
we've started to fill in the niches of what is a 
maximum opportunity for quality of life? What is

33:34.832 --> 33:35.813
quality of life? It's more than just shelter, 
having a nice bathroom, having a nice tile and

33:36.895 --> 33:42.503
countertops in your kitchen. It's what is the 
environment in the community. And most real

33:44.957 --> 33:57.513
estate developers, if I start talking to them 
about cultural anthropology or social

33:44.957 --> 33:57.513
behavioral science, we'll find another project 
where that's a positive ingredient to the

33:44.957 --> 33:57.513
planning process. I would think so, too. That's a 
good statement. Yeah, that's brilliant. And that

34:02.840 --> 34:08.727
picture on the wall over there is Robert Ardrey and 
I in old Rome. He wrote the African Genesis, the

34:09.584 --> 34:15.310
Social Contract, the Territorial Imperative, 
and the Hunting Hypothesis. A giant in his field.

34:18.533 --> 34:21.236
He came before sociobiology by Wilson. And yet all 
of those following quote, he was the leader in that

34:21.977 --> 34:26.121
field. He's helped me change my mind about how to 
plan communities for people. And the woodlands is

34:32.448 --> 34:36.132
the living example of those theories. which need 
to be defined and stated and published. That's a

34:38.717 --> 34:39.738
good statement. And so the SIS, again, to 
summarize. Security, identity, stimulation.

34:46.826 --> 34:50.530
And if you have those three, you have the last one, 
which I added. SIS came from my debates with

34:50.550 --> 34:52.793
Audrey. That's love. And that's love of self, 
family, neighbors, and your community. It's

35:01.062 --> 35:01.782
allegiance. It's what people die for. Allegiance 
to a place. When the city of Houston wants to annex

35:06.790 --> 35:16.303
the woodlands, there's going to be a tremendous 
outcry because the people have sunk their roots in

35:06.790 --> 35:16.303
here. They have an allegiance to this place. The 
territorial imperative of human beings is you

35:19.828 --> 35:25.656
defend your turf. If you didn't defend your turf, 
you did not survive because the food scale, food

35:25.676 --> 35:34.789
stock was such that the human primate troops Get up 
in the morning, go out, hunt, food gather, come

35:35.292 --> 35:39.216
back to a certain area. That could support your 40 
to 50 people. If you let people come and nibble off

35:42.559 --> 35:46.623
your side, there wasn't enough food, you died. So 
you defended territory. People put up fences.

35:50.507 --> 35:52.389
They argue about a foot of property. It doesn't 
matter. When I used to serve, I said, why are you

35:54.191 --> 35:56.693
worried about this? It's my property. Later, I 
learned there's a sense of territory. You didn't

36:03.240 --> 36:05.282
defend it, it meant death. And the people that 
didn't defend turf to the death didn't reproduce

36:05.878 --> 36:11.464
to be here. So it's been reinforced, reinforced, 
all down through the millennium. And now we're

36:15.869 --> 36:18.852
territorially defensive people. We want to 
defend our territory. We were in trouble in the

36:22.817 --> 36:24.238
Middle East. Those people were defended. Sure. We 
were in trouble in Vietnam. You cannot send an army

36:29.044 --> 36:33.649
to a foreign place and have them fight anywhere 
near the ferocity of somebody if you're on their

36:33.967 --> 36:37.012
land. It's like a puppy dog in your yard. You see 
what happens in a football game at the goal line.

36:42.222 --> 36:49.114
When the defenders get their backs to the goal 
line, it's amazing how stronger their defense is.

36:49.594 --> 36:57.308
It's a living proof that defense of territory, the 
closer you get to your property, the closer you,

36:49.594 --> 36:57.308
the harder you fight to defend it. And the same 
thing is here. There's an allegiance to this

36:59.249 --> 37:06.917
place, and I'm telling you, I've known more people 
in 15 years, 16 years, because their company sent

36:59.249 --> 37:06.917
them away. They left any number of them, quit their 
job for 15 years seniority because they wanted to

37:06.997 --> 37:16.487
come back here with them. My secretary's husband 
transferred to San Francisco, 17 years with the

37:16.627 --> 37:23.074
company, big promotion. He said, I'm not going. I 
said, you're crazy. He said, I'm not going. You

37:27.629 --> 37:28.730
can't throw that away. I'm not going. He went to 
school and studied real estate, started a whole

37:30.692 --> 37:35.378
new career after 17 because he wouldn't leave 
here. I mean, it's an amazing example. If you say to

37:38.942 --> 37:46.811
me the theories that I have on S-I-S plus love, L, 
they're working. And when I go out and talk to

37:46.831 --> 37:50.835
people in the community and I listen to what they 
say back. I don't know if you have. You need to do

37:55.667 --> 37:56.869
this in the classroom. That's a capacity. Well, I 
do. You do? Good. I'm an adjunct professor up at

37:59.413 --> 38:01.176
A&M. Good. OK. Where are you from? A&M. Yeah. I 
teach in the history department. So I do this to the

38:07.445 --> 38:13.575
College of Architecture once a year to the 
graduate division. And I also do the same thing at

38:13.755 --> 38:18.983
the University of Houston School of 
Architecture. is talk about community planning

38:19.317 --> 38:46.776
and i try to get them beyond the facade and the 
hardware and the design of things right say what

38:19.317 --> 38:46.776
you're really you're trying to build 
environments for people if you build a great

38:19.317 --> 38:46.776
environment for people that they aspire to be in to 
be part of that will breed success and you'll be

38:19.317 --> 38:46.776
rewarded by the money that you make too many 
developers too you know you add up all the numbers

38:19.317 --> 38:46.776
dollars in dollars out and there's a profit So 
they're fighting to make these numbers work. And I

38:50.378 --> 38:52.682
just say, OK, the accountants can do that. I'm 
going to build an environment that's so good that

38:52.802 --> 38:55.926
people will come. They'll pay anything to buy a 
house there, even if it's more than somewhere

38:55.946 --> 39:00.092
else. And then I'll get rewarded because I did a 
good job creating that environment. The numbers

39:03.377 --> 39:04.819
will take care of themselves. It doesn't fly when 
you talk to accountants, but that's my personal

39:06.221 --> 39:10.707
philosophy. That was sort of my next question, 
too, and that is, In your planning and development

39:14.482 --> 39:21.631
of the woodland, basically, you're not 
cost-oriented necessarily. You're not, I mean,

39:21.651 --> 39:28.380
you have to be, but at what point does the cost 
profit? It's a constant challenge, and it should

39:28.440 --> 39:31.024
be. It should be. It should be. It needs to be. I 
mean, you can't go off into wild blue yonder. There

39:36.270 --> 39:42.919
is not a single solitary sub-neighborhood of a 
village that we don't plant and do an economic

39:43.473 --> 39:47.536
model on before we hardline the plan. And we 
usually do three or four plans. And we try to refine

39:49.478 --> 39:58.045
the environment better and better and better, 
watching the infrastructure costs and the

39:49.478 --> 39:58.045
revenue potentials all along the way. And then if 
it doesn't have a proper internal rate of return

39:58.426 --> 40:04.471
projected, go back to the drawing board and do it 
again. But the first step is planning, then the

40:04.491 --> 40:06.913
cost analysis. Right. And then refinement, if 
it's not profitable enough or if we think we can

40:07.794 --> 40:13.058
make it even better. But the two do go hand in hand. 
The problem that you have a lot of times is

40:15.489 --> 40:20.315
providing infrastructure. Most of the American 
industry now is heavily involved at the

40:20.335 --> 40:26.824
management level with accountants. And they're 
so bottom line focused because everybody's

40:26.844 --> 40:31.050
looking for profits. So their stock values go up. 
Their earnings go up. And if it doesn't go up every

40:34.314 --> 40:36.998
year, somebody's got to move. And it's a crazy 
quest. But nevertheless, it's there. And it's

40:41.708 --> 40:48.338
hard for me to say, you know, this cluster of park 
benches are important for this environment. And

40:48.639 --> 40:50.742
they'll say, they isolate things. They'll say, 
those benches don't make a profit. That fountain

40:55.570 --> 40:57.333
doesn't make a profit. That sculpture doesn't 
make a profit. I keep saying, you've got to think of

40:59.857 --> 41:02.341
the composite balance sheet. The overall, the 
reason you're getting the prices for your houses

41:03.082 --> 41:07.108
and the pace that that they're selling is because 
people come and they can see the fountain. They can

41:10.946 --> 41:12.147
sit on the bench. They can take a run down the hike 
and bike trail through the forest. And those

41:17.595 --> 41:25.345
things, when you add them all in, are part of the 
quality of life that's going to make this place

41:17.595 --> 41:25.345
successful, unique. And I told George Mitchell, 
when the sun sets on this century, I want the

41:26.968 --> 41:33.256
Woodlands to be the finest community in this 
country. And we've got a good shot at it. Give it

41:35.523 --> 41:36.945
another 9, 10 years. So you see an awful lot 
happening between now and 2000. I mean, this is

41:41.132 --> 41:44.718
really the big takeoff is right now. Absolutely. I 
mean, we've been cranking lots for a long time, and

41:45.459 --> 41:51.569
we'll be cranking them for another 10 or 20 years. 
But to bring on the town center and the urban

41:52.330 --> 41:57.579
complex, we need to get a college here. We need to 
get a community college, and we need a lot of

41:57.959 --> 42:02.847
things. We need to add to the cultural amenities. 
The pavilion's just one. We need an enclosed

42:08.133 --> 42:09.214
theater. We need a sports stadium. Maybe for 
international tennis meets. I mean, there's so

42:14.680 --> 42:17.242
many more things that we can add to the menu. We need 
to create an urban environment. We need an urban

42:19.644 --> 42:25.270
village where not everybody needs to live on a lot 
in the forest. There's early singles, early

42:26.070 --> 42:29.113
marrieds. There's empty nesters. There's 
retirees. We'd like to be in a more urban setting

42:31.135 --> 42:33.137
where you can Walk to the stores, and walk to the 
cultural events, and not be out having to take care

42:33.404 --> 42:40.955
of a big piece of property. So we need to work 
continually to have more variety. To be

42:44.281 --> 42:49.188
successful also in a community, you can't just 
have one product in one price range. You need to

42:49.208 --> 42:54.316
say, the marketplace has all of these different 
people that we're wishing. Some people want

42:54.336 --> 42:55.417
townhouses. Some want apartments. What price? 
Well, some want condominiums. Some want a

42:59.343 --> 43:01.707
mid-rise. And then someone wants single family in 
all sorts of sizes and shapes and scales. So if we

43:08.208 --> 43:15.497
can have all those things going and get our 
percentage of each one of those, then our volumes

43:08.208 --> 43:15.497
and pace go up. The name of the game is pace, because 
the interest clock runs. And that interest money

43:18.921 --> 43:23.486
eats you up if you take too long to get it done. So you 
need to keep the pace going.

43:28.411 --> 43:32.436
If things happen as you anticipate, at the year 
2000, It'll be pretty well an established entity.

43:35.787 --> 43:37.168
That'll be the woodland. There'll be enough of the 
basic infrastructure that the last 20 years, I

43:37.729 --> 43:50.222
think, from 2000 to 2020, those are the 
revenue-producing years. The values of those

43:50.662 --> 43:58.651
added things from then on will be just immensely 
profitable. Immensely profitable. Is the

44:00.192 --> 44:05.018
reality you see here now pretty well what you would 
have anticipated when you came here? Yes. You

44:06.219 --> 44:07.701
really have been on track pretty much. Yeah. I'm 
disappointed that the pace was as slow as it was

44:08.602 --> 44:21.076
because we had that terrible depression in Texas 
in the mid-'80s, and we had not such a good start

44:08.602 --> 44:21.076
because of things were housing in the early 70s, 
too. But I think it's given... Well... We've come

44:28.424 --> 44:33.629
as far as we could with those economic forces, 
which, of course, were beyond our control. And

44:33.649 --> 44:35.231
they may come again. The style, the quality that 
you anticipated is basically .. Yeah. The way we

44:40.877 --> 44:49.285
envisioned the multi, the wide diversity of 
economic housing, which is hard to do. We're

44:49.306 --> 44:54.651
bypassing land now because there was a shortage of 
people to build apartments or townhouses. But now

44:55.188 --> 44:59.233
they're filled up, and so now we're going to start 
doing apartments again. We've bypassed parcels

44:59.294 --> 45:03.419
so we can infill later when those demands are 
there. But I think that we've so far adhered pretty

45:04.881 --> 45:16.757
much to the goals of the master plan, and my 
principles are the behavioral response side for

45:04.881 --> 45:16.757
the plan.
