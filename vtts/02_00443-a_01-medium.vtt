WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:14.679
later I think attributed directly to Hitler to try 
to cut the Allied forces in two and capture the port

00:02.377 --> 00:14.679
of Antwerp. So we were right along the way to Liège 
and Antwerp. So that's what presumably the grand

00:20.089 --> 00:26.140
strategy was. By that time, of course, the Germans 
really didn't have enough resources to pull off

00:26.440 --> 00:35.357
that sort of maneuver. They had far more success 
than their capability deserved because the

00:35.377 --> 00:48.162
weather cooperated with them so well and we 
couldn't use our Air Force dominance.

00:50.504 --> 00:53.530
Did you capture quite a few German troops? No, just 
a few, these parachute troops as far as our

00:53.550 --> 01:01.245
artillery battalion was concerned. Did you ever 
talk to any German troops? Did you have an

01:03.149 --> 01:05.053
opportunity to talk with any? No, I didn't. The 
ones that were captured were taken to the division

01:12.745 --> 01:19.174
collecting station and turned over to the G2 
intelligence people, and I never got involved

01:12.745 --> 01:19.174
with that. Our battalion S2 intelligence officer 
did. Yes, because of course any of our troops, any

01:23.760 --> 01:41.385
chairman, soldiers, or intelligence 
information picked up came under the S2

01:23.760 --> 01:41.385
intelligence officer, and I was an S3 fire 
direction. Sure. Didn't get involved in that. Did

01:44.186 --> 01:51.173
your battalion take early heavy casualties 
during the Battle of the Bulge or was it? Not one.

01:53.095 --> 01:54.036
Not one? Didn't lose anybody. Because they 
sidestepped you sort of. That's right and of

01:57.840 --> 02:04.527
course we were medium artillery and we were back 
from the front lines a little bit. They didn't have

02:04.547 --> 02:06.910
any air capability either. Not by that time, no. 
The 19, in fact our battalion I think was only 19

02:08.551 --> 02:25.435
killed or something like that, and that was fairly 
early after Omaha Beach when one of our ammunition

02:08.551 --> 02:25.435
trucks got hit by a bomb from a German bomber one 
night. Casualties around there, then we had 100%

02:27.158 --> 02:33.487
casualties in our aviation observation planes. 
One of them had an accident in a takeoff where he

02:37.964 --> 02:48.317
crashed and burned and another plane was shot down 
by a MiG fighter. By what kind of thing? MiG, the

02:52.021 --> 02:54.444
German fighter plane. Messerschmitt? 
Messerschmitt. It was called MiG. Is that what you

02:58.509 --> 02:59.791
call it? That's what it's called, yeah. And of 
course we first saw the The jet aircraft from the

03:06.297 --> 03:11.323
Germans along about this time too. What did you 
think of that? Well we thought that was fantastic.

03:16.069 --> 03:20.514
Our anti-aircraft fire was just absolutely 
ineffective against the jet aircraft. They were

03:20.554 --> 03:21.856
so much faster. But they were pretty effective 
against the old slow dive bomber types.

03:32.669 --> 03:36.253
Now what happened to the second division after 
Battle of the Bulge. Okay, then the advance was

03:39.524 --> 03:46.574
rather rapid right on up to the Rhine River. Yeah. 
And we were stationed near Remagen. Oh really?

03:52.122 --> 04:05.802
Yeah, the uh the uh of course American

03:52.122 --> 04:05.802
one of the American uh mechanized divisions got to 
Remoggin and got across the bridge before they

04:07.098 --> 04:14.710
could destroy the bridge across the Rhine. And 
that was a tremendous advantage. And we were

04:18.176 --> 04:24.265
stationed along the Rhine River at that time and 
moved up to it fairly rapidly. At that time- And did

04:26.288 --> 04:28.031
you cross the bridge too? No, that was March of 45. 
and that's where I exited. I was messing around

04:37.333 --> 04:42.579
where I didn't have any business. Got in a little 
shoe mine and got a hole blown through my right

04:42.599 --> 04:50.628
foot, so I got evacuated on March 15th of 45. Yeah, I 
was gonna ask you about while you were a patient for

04:51.309 --> 04:57.275
it looks like five months. Yeah, and then got 
released actually because I got evacuated to

05:02.870 --> 05:07.374
Paris and then to England and then back to the 
United States. Sent out to Modesto, California

05:08.636 --> 05:16.263
presumably for recovery and commitment to 
Pacific Theater. But actually- Basically what

05:18.265 --> 05:22.149
happened then is you stepped on a mine? Stepped on a 
little old shoe mine, apparently. When I was just

05:26.053 --> 05:31.358
out messing around, it was a beautiful day, March 
the 15th, and it's strange where we were. on Orion

05:32.435 --> 05:39.728
River, the primary observation post was behind 
our headquarters. Very unusual. On a high hill,

05:42.413 --> 05:51.128
and it was right from the headquarters, so I just 
got out to stroll out to the observation post when I

05:42.413 --> 05:51.128
was off duty as fire direction officer. So I walked 
up the hill and was messing around the observation

05:52.651 --> 05:56.097
post, Just taking a look, basically. Just taking a 
look. Doing something I didn't have any business

05:59.728 --> 06:01.650
doing. Actually, by that time we had pretty well 
known that the Germans were defeated and we were

06:01.710 --> 06:13.301
looking for souvenirs to bring home. I saw a German 
rifle sticking in the ground over in one place. I

06:18.506 --> 06:25.273
went over and pulled this out of the ground, but the 
Germans had apparently booby trapped around

06:18.506 --> 06:25.273
that. At the time I pulled it out, it was very 
strange. I thought it had gone off, and I shot a hole

06:30.174 --> 06:33.298
in my foot. And I didn't really know until later, 
until the doctors determined that the wound in the

06:33.438 --> 06:45.033
foot came from the bottom instead of the top, that 
it was similar. The little old shoe mines were

06:45.473 --> 06:47.396
similar. They used rifle bullets. I shot a hole 
through my right foot, which took me out of action

06:57.687 --> 06:59.350
for a while. Yeah, you were lucky that it didn't put 
a bigger hole in you. That's right, actually the

07:05.720 --> 07:19.442
war was virtually over from then and our 2nd 
Division wound up in Czechoslovakia before the So

07:05.720 --> 07:19.442
then you were under Patton again? Yes, the 
division I think was put under Patton again. I

07:26.746 --> 07:30.773
can't remember who the direct commander was at 
that time. By that time, Bradley was directly

07:30.833 --> 07:37.104
under Eisenhower and had an army group. But the 
Remagen Bridge area was a very, very spectacular

07:39.768 --> 07:45.278
thing, of course. That gave a tremendous 
advantage. The Germans put everything they could

07:48.183 --> 07:52.450
in there to try to destroy that bridge. which they 
did, it collapsed after three or four days, but by

07:53.695 --> 08:10.538
that time there had been about three other, two or 
three other ponton bridges put across the brine,

07:53.695 --> 08:10.538
so that the crossing was established and was a big 
factor in the war at that time. How'd you get along

08:13.041 --> 08:14.503
with the French people?

08:17.347 --> 08:22.234
Oh, we didn't see very much of French people.

08:26.095 --> 08:31.640
in the Ardennes in southern France.

08:35.663 --> 08:40.827
You see the Germans were withdrawing as we were 
fighting. They were giving up ground grudgingly

08:40.888 --> 08:50.516
early on, and we just didn't see very many 
civilians of any kind. The Germans, as they pulled

08:50.696 --> 08:55.680
back, they'd shoot the cattle and they were kind of 
devastating the country as they retreated in the

08:55.897 --> 09:02.907
hedgerow country. Hedgerows were tremendous 
factors in the early battle. The biggest surprise

09:10.738 --> 09:22.495
the Germans got was some brilliant warrant 
officer in the second division devised a way for

09:10.738 --> 09:22.495
the tanks to cross the hedgerows. and all of the 
tanks in the division were taken back during the

09:23.116 --> 09:46.215
six weeks we were sitting there and had angle iron 
probes put up welded on the front of them so that a

09:23.116 --> 09:46.215
tank would run these probes into a hedgerow and 
then when the tracks raised a little bit it just

09:23.116 --> 09:46.215
lift the top off those hedgerows so they could go 
right over the hedgerow one after another. That

09:46.456 --> 09:48.499
was a big factor in the breakout. Now when we got out 
of Brest, we did have some contact with French

09:49.795 --> 09:53.962
people.

09:57.026 --> 09:59.030
The strangest things happened in war. When we were 
down there, we ran out of salt. We didn't have any

10:02.155 --> 10:05.340
salt in the dining hall. So after Brest fell, we 
were looking around for what we might buy from the

10:05.360 --> 10:12.391
French. We hadn't had any fresh eggs. So we went out 
looking for eggs, and didn't have any salt. We also

10:21.380 --> 10:25.049
bought a calf from a Frenchman butchered calf. To 
have a little meat, fresh meat. And so our S4 went

10:30.342 --> 10:33.590
out looking for salt around. The Germans had taken 
up all the salt. so that the French couldn't

10:37.585 --> 10:43.572
withhold food supplies and preserve the salt. We 
finally found two pounds of salt in a convent down

10:43.592 --> 10:50.580
in that area. So the French down in that area were 
friendly, alright. We did a little business with

10:56.227 --> 11:03.636
them, but we just didn't have much contact. Did you 
ever get any liberty or any time off? Well that's a

11:08.433 --> 11:11.436
real strange story. We did have a certain 
allocation for the battalion to send troops back

11:11.956 --> 11:19.023
to Paris.

11:21.885 --> 11:31.234
One of the strangest stories, experiences I had, 
of course we got the overseas edition of Time

11:21.885 --> 11:31.234
Magazine, Newsweek, that sort of thing. I saw in 
Time Magazine, in early 1945, When we were in

11:37.542 --> 11:46.837
Lausfeld, Germany, we were there about six weeks 
or so, as I told you, scattered out a long way where

11:37.542 --> 11:46.837
the Battle of the Bulls occurred.

11:49.902 --> 11:56.833
So that was late 1944, and I saw where Westinghouse 
had resumed production of irons.

12:00.408 --> 12:07.119
So I told one of my talented young fire direction 
soldiers, I said, write him a letter and ask him to

12:00.408 --> 12:07.119
send us one of these irons. Tell him there's no need 
to clean up your clothes a little bit. We're

12:11.486 --> 12:15.453
getting a little leave to go to Paris now and all. So 
he did, just kind of on a joke. The damn

12:18.598 --> 12:23.526
Westinghouse didn't send us an iron. They did. We 
used it for that purpose, to clean up clothes. and

12:27.425 --> 12:31.669
iron clothes to get soldiers ready to go into 
Paris, France. It was an unusual thing. Did you get

12:33.891 --> 12:34.973
into Paris? Did you get any R&R? No, not me. I got 
into Paris after I was wounded. I was in the

12:40.018 --> 12:41.119
hospital there. Did any of your troops? Oh yes, 
some of our troops did get leave to go to Paris, as I

12:42.900 --> 12:46.864
say. We did use the iron and help them clean up 
clothes. Not very many, but the division would

12:51.869 --> 12:56.554
have a quota to send on R&R to Paris.

12:59.538 --> 13:02.061
So there was some of that. Artillery troops are not 
relieved for R&R. They are not considered to be

13:08.227 --> 13:13.912
under as much stress, and actually they're not. So 
artillery is never in reserve. So you don't have an

13:18.477 --> 13:28.667
occasion to be able to relieve a large number of the 
troops and artillery to send for rest and

13:18.477 --> 13:28.667
recreation. How'd you get along with the German 
people? Well, in this,

13:35.723 --> 13:58.890
we were stationed in this little town of 
Lautsfeld, Germany early on, and that's really

13:35.723 --> 13:58.890
the only experience I had much with the German 
people, and of course we,

13:35.723 --> 13:58.890
in the case of them getting along with us, we were 
the dominant factor there. sure did throw our

13:59.090 --> 14:02.153
weight around a little bit there. Was there a lot of 
antagonism? Oh yes, we sure didn't trust them.

14:09.902 --> 14:14.607
They stayed in their houses and they catered to us 
pretty good. I had a little meats experience. One

14:19.132 --> 14:28.202
time we requisitioned a hog from one of the people, 
butchered hog, used a quarter ton trailer for a

14:19.132 --> 14:28.202
scalding vat, our mess heaters to heat the water 
with butchered hog.

14:37.108 --> 14:48.089
I imagine the United States government paid a lot 
of money for that hog after the war was over, I

14:37.108 --> 14:48.089
don't know. The Germans

14:51.368 --> 15:00.078
There's no question that during that period of 
time, we didn't have enough troops to keep the

14:51.368 --> 15:00.078
Germans from going back and forth across the front 
lines. And I'm certain that some of the people in

15:00.158 --> 15:12.273
the little village of Lodsfeld, where we were, 
informed the German troops of our presence,

15:00.158 --> 15:12.273
because we did get some counter-battery fire. Of 
course, the most spectacular thing happening

15:12.293 --> 15:20.042
long about then was the buzz bombs.

15:21.187 --> 15:28.217
We were kinda stationed right on the path from the 
launching site toward England. And one of these-

15:28.237 --> 15:30.240
So you could watch these and hear them go? We could 
see and hear them and one of them failed and fell

15:30.320 --> 15:41.477
about 500 yards from our battalion headquarters 
at one time. So we were able to look at it at close

15:41.517 --> 15:43.880
range. It did not explode. But

15:45.142 --> 15:50.029
during that time, the buzz bomb, the unmanned 
bomb.

15:58.417 --> 16:01.182
What did you think when you saw all these things 
going over? Well, we thought that was a kind of a

16:01.202 --> 16:07.413
last gasp weapon. I don't believe I knew. We all 
thought that, well, I'm so sure add to the

16:15.524 --> 16:26.303
devastation of London and the heavy population 
centers in England, but we didn't think they were

16:15.524 --> 16:26.303
much of a factor as far as the tactical troops. 
There wasn't any big enough target, you know, for

16:26.323 --> 16:32.293
the buzz bombs along the front lines. They just 
weren't that accurate. They weren't that

16:33.896 --> 16:37.903
accurate, and

16:39.554 --> 16:48.664
They were designed to be targeted on major cities, 
because I'm sure they couldn't hit anything

16:39.554 --> 16:48.664
within five miles of where they were aimed.

16:55.352 --> 16:57.074
But we thought they were kind of ingenious. They 
had military devices, all right. They certainly

17:00.077 --> 17:01.579
were at that time. Now let's talk about your 
hospitalization.

17:09.170 --> 17:18.625
I was evacuated to

17:09.170 --> 17:18.625
Paris first, just there overnight, and then back 
to England. How severe was the wound? Well, it was

17:21.730 --> 17:28.541
just behind my toes, a little hole through the 
foot. It, of course, tore up the bones and

17:29.884 --> 17:36.274
ligaments in that area. In England, I

17:38.363 --> 17:46.631
can remember very well crawling between clean 
sheets. I hadn't seen any of those for 287 days, or

17:47.452 --> 17:53.237
whatever it was, 289 days. What a thrill it was to 
get in bed with clean sheets. The army doctors did

17:59.203 --> 18:05.669
an outstanding job of cleaning this wound and 
dressing it. They took loose skin from my thigh and

18:07.642 --> 18:09.765
covered the wound. As I started recovering then, I 
was put on a hospital ship to go back to the United

18:11.807 --> 18:17.194
States. I think we were 11 days in transit there. 
First on a hospital train to go to the port.

18:26.626 --> 18:35.978
And man, I was sure that I'd be sent from New York to 
Temple, Texas or somewhere down in my area. sure

18:36.177 --> 18:41.303
was looking forward to seeing my wife.

18:41.323 --> 18:47.350
And getting back closer to home, so you can 
imagine. But I was disappointed when I got put on

18:47.370 --> 18:54.999
the hospital train that sent all the way across the 
United States to California. You didn't get any

18:55.360 --> 18:57.402
leave at all? Oh well, not then. I was still 
hospitalized. After uh, to getting to Hammond

19:07.733 --> 19:13.199
General Hospital in California.

19:15.502 --> 19:21.569
The ward I was put in had several of my former 
acquaintances. Like James E. Monk Vance, who's

19:23.771 --> 19:28.877
now in Ag Communications right over here. Frank 
Litters, who worked for Texas A&M. We were in the

19:32.541 --> 19:37.707
same ward.

19:38.193 --> 19:47.264
The nurse on that ward is now James E. Vance's wife, 
so he married our nurse.

19:51.189 --> 19:54.773
There were some other Texas Aggies in that ward. It 
was... That you felt comfortable there? Oh yeah,

19:59.499 --> 20:03.064
we played bridge and it was pretty easy living 
there. Of course we all thought that that we

20:06.374 --> 20:10.198
probably would get committed to the Pacific 
Campaign. What did you think about that? I mean

20:11.740 --> 20:20.009
after being in Warnhoff or in France and in 
Germany, were you eager or were you resistant? No,

20:20.029 --> 20:24.534
I wasn't eager, but accepted it as a soldier's 
duty. We recovered, we'd be recommitted to

20:25.576 --> 20:28.619
combat. I got into New York Harbor on VE Day. So the 
war in Europe was over before I got sent to

20:34.792 --> 20:46.731
California, Modesto, California, to Hammond 
General Hospital.

20:46.751 --> 21:01.896
Now when I was given leave, my wife came out to visit 
me there, and when I was given leave, I was starting

20:46.751 --> 21:01.896
back to Texas, and when I was in Los Angeles, 
California, I was in Los Angeles on VJ Day, saw the

21:03.513 --> 21:09.140
town really celebrate. I was on my way back for 
leave then from Hammond General Hospital.

21:19.572 --> 21:31.326
Then came right back and I was reassigned to the 
hospital at Fort Sam Houston and put on outpatient

21:19.572 --> 21:31.326
leave. until December of 45. Yeah, but I came back 
in August and resumed my employment with the

21:35.262 --> 21:44.596
Dining Hall Department of Texas A&M in late August 
or September of 1945. Okay, let's talk about the

21:44.736 --> 21:51.024
end of your military active duty then. Why'd you 
decide to get out of the military? Oh we didn't

21:54.850 --> 21:59.997
really, it wasn't any serious consideration. 
Very few officers were retained in the military

22:00.938 --> 22:08.068
forces, and it was never a thought at all to stay in 
the army. Not on my part. Then why did you decide to

22:11.633 --> 22:13.656
stay in the reserves? Well, I wasn't 
disillusioned with the military at all. I'd had a

22:19.704 --> 22:28.236
successful career, and I was stimulated by 
military

22:19.704 --> 22:28.236
duty. Still am. What was your rank when you were 
discharged? Well, I got a terminal promotion to

22:36.081 --> 22:39.445
major. I was a captain. When I was first called into 
the Army, there was a sergeant by the name of O'Shea

22:42.489 --> 22:53.862
in the school for bakers and cooks, and he and I 
worked together on menu planning

22:57.470 --> 23:05.526
He was in the headquarters school for Bakers and 
Cooks, so when I went to San Antonio to be

22:57.470 --> 23:05.526
discharged, I went back over there to visit my old 
friends. He was a major and I was a captain. He

23:08.713 --> 23:09.555
hadn't been anywhere. He was still sitting at St.

23:14.176 --> 23:23.709
So he had completed his reserve officer training 
and got qualified for a commission and outranked

23:14.176 --> 23:23.709
me. But he was a good soldier. I didn't regret that. 
When I first went on active duty, Eisenhower was

23:29.858 --> 23:35.505
stationed at Fort St. Houston. Third Army 
headquarters was there. General Kruger, they had

23:37.308 --> 23:42.495
what was called the Smith-Young Tower. leased in 
San Antonio that's still the tallest building in

23:42.982 --> 23:47.067
San Antonio. Eisenhower was a lieutenant colonel 
when I first went on duty. I've often said that

23:52.935 --> 23:59.243
there must be something wrong with our promotion 
system. He got promoted seven times to my three.

24:06.253 --> 24:06.753
He was a colonel. Did you have an opportunity to 
meet Eisenhower? No, I really didn't. I got to his

24:10.015 --> 24:17.262
headquarters over in London from Northern 
Ireland. I had an opportunity to go on leave to

24:17.322 --> 24:29.653
London, where the G1 in Eisenhower's 
headquarters, the personnel officer, was one of

24:17.322 --> 24:29.653
my old ROTC instructors named Lloyd Garrison. So I 
lived with him for a few days in his apartment up in

24:31.154 --> 24:38.841
the middle of London, not very far from Buckingham 
Palace. So I did get a look at Eisenhower's

24:39.040 --> 24:46.188
headquarters in London, all right, but I never met 
the man. Now I met his son. John, just a few years

24:49.412 --> 25:01.407
ago, I was at the Army War College with his son John, 
who later made Brigadier General too. He was a

25:01.487 --> 25:08.575
reserve officer, so we were at the same course at 
the Army War College. I would imagine that the

25:08.825 --> 25:15.754
troops had very high regard for Eisenhower. No 
question. Why is that? Well, I really don't know,

25:20.541 --> 25:37.043
except that he was generally perceived as doing a 
fine job in the most demanding military role ever

25:20.541 --> 25:37.043
in history.

25:37.563 --> 25:49.277
Stars and Stripes, all the press he got was quite 
favorable, so

25:37.563 --> 25:49.277
I'd say that there's 100% respect and admiration 
of Eisenhower. What about General Marshall?

25:53.982 --> 25:56.005
Well, he was pretty remote. We didn't have really 
any feeling for General Marshall. One of our

26:04.141 --> 26:08.127
previous division commanders was named John C.H. 
Lee. He was commander of the

26:08.748 --> 26:13.835
troops. He was a very religious sort of a guy and 
unusual. He commanded the second division at Fort

26:17.501 --> 26:31.802
Sam Houston for a while and later was promoted 
lieutenant general and was logistic officer and

26:17.501 --> 26:31.802
communications zone headquarters.

26:34.330 --> 26:42.723
and because of his initials and his devotion to 
religion, all the troops called him Jesus Christ

26:34.330 --> 26:42.723
himself. JCH Lee called him Jesus Christ himself. 
He wasn't a very outstanding combat commander.

26:54.280 --> 27:00.810
Later on we had an artillery commander by the name 
of Hayes, and he By golly, I believe he won the Medal

27:01.060 --> 27:04.164
of Honor in World War I. No kidding. And he was a 
tremendous combat leader. We had him as Artillery

27:09.271 --> 27:14.699
Division Artillery Commander for just about a 
month after we got into combat. He was pulled out

27:16.281 --> 27:22.950
and given the 10th Mountain Division, brought 
back to the United States and made it Division

27:16.281 --> 27:22.950
Commander. we saw where that division was 
committed in Italy and we said, well it won't be

27:24.955 --> 27:32.165
long until they'll stir things up in Italy because 
he was a fighter. That was true. He was, then he was

27:35.530 --> 27:44.222
deputy commander to Lucius Clay after, in Berlin. 
He was a tremendous soldier. He transformed

27:51.820 --> 27:57.455
Division artillery, the second division from 
kind of parade ground troops into fighting. Could

27:57.596 --> 28:07.483
you compare the quality of the army in World War II 
with the quality of the German army?

28:11.243 --> 28:20.493
The German army varied tremendously in quality 
because they had the SS troops, the panzer troops,

28:11.243 --> 28:20.493
and then they had the satellite troops and 
everything. But their elite troops were

28:20.513 --> 28:29.743
fanatical, disciplined soldiers that would, 
without question, do whatever the commander

28:20.513 --> 28:29.743
said. No American troops were ever that way. The 
strength of the American soldier was his

28:34.928 --> 28:41.115
independent thinking, his ingenuity, Not blind 
loyalty, blind obedience, blind discipline.

28:50.616 --> 29:00.570
Mechanical ability, but you know that's the way 
I'd characterize the American troops is most of

28:50.616 --> 29:00.570
them were not professional soldiers. I'd say they 
were a little more difficult to lead. Even in those

29:06.139 --> 29:09.904
days when There was much more inclination to 
accept authority than there is today. There

29:18.714 --> 29:22.318
wasn't blind acceptance of authority at all.

29:26.322 --> 29:33.269
Of course we had some black troops and in those days 
they did not have a very good reputation. It was

29:33.289 --> 29:39.435
probably a bad mistake to have all black troops led 
by white officers. when I decided to make a

29:40.664 --> 29:44.329
transfer back to the artillery. I told you earlier 
that Colonel Bilsing was a good friend of mine and

29:46.132 --> 29:55.164
showed me possibly a little favoritism as a senior 
cadet. I helped him teach agitation. So I found out

29:59.590 --> 30:10.485
that he was division commander of, I mean division 
artillery commander of a division stationed at

29:59.590 --> 30:10.485
Fort Huachuca, Arizona. So I telephoned him and I 
decided to transfer to find out if he needed any

30:12.237 --> 30:18.765
officers in his outfit. He could definitely get a 
transfer because I had such admiration for the

30:18.785 --> 30:22.050
man. He said, well O.D. you don't want to get in this 
outfit, it is a black outfit and we have trouble

30:24.433 --> 30:33.324
with troop discipline and troop competence. What 
year was this? That was 42. That was early, you see I

30:38.647 --> 30:45.781
put in for transfer in early 42 after December the 
7th. And the transfer really didn't occur until

30:46.683 --> 30:56.222
April of 42, so I just didn't try to exercise any 
preference at all on the transfer. Just let them

30:56.342 --> 30:58.025
transfer me where they would. So I got transferred 
from the post-camp and station troops of Fort Sam

31:01.968 --> 31:19.605
Houston with the school for Bakers and Cooks as an 
8th Army outfit, 8th Corps outfit, I mean out in the

31:01.968 --> 31:19.605
3rd Army over to the division right there just 
around the corner from where the headquarters

31:01.968 --> 31:19.605
was.
