WEBVTT

00:05.600 --> 00:17.175
Why do you feel as if we possibly get better data 
from our, or as good a data from our vessels as the

00:05.600 --> 00:17.175
Soviet Union does with, in terms of funding of 
expedition, sizes of expedition? Is there any

00:17.195 --> 00:20.178
explanation for that, or have I inferred wrong? I 
find it difficult to make this kind of a

00:21.260 --> 00:24.704
comparison. I'm

00:26.987 --> 00:34.797
saying that I'm frequently asked to compare the 
Russian with the US that seems to be a let's see

00:35.671 --> 01:04.041
that's a question which intrigues people much 
more than say comparing US with England or with

00:35.671 --> 01:04.041
France or so on I find that comparison difficult to 
make that's the point some people find it easier

00:35.671 --> 01:04.041
than I do I I Both in, let's see, people are 
interested in the level of technology, in the

01:06.552 --> 01:20.926
magnitude of the achievement, in the quality of 
the work, and so on. And to me, it's not an easy

01:20.946 --> 01:27.213
question to answer. It's not conspicuously one 
way or the other. It depends on the individual

01:30.416 --> 01:36.062
situation.

01:36.482 --> 01:36.542
OK. Just eliminate the next three questions I was 
going to ask you about that.

01:45.417 --> 01:54.147
Do you have any views on the role that sea 
conferences have played in bringing together

01:45.417 --> 01:54.147
international cooperation?

01:56.230 --> 01:59.193
You mean international meetings, scientific 
meetings? Scientific meetings are very

01:59.213 --> 02:06.462
important, more so in oceanography, I think, many 
other fields because of the fact that the oceans,

02:06.813 --> 02:23.640
the study of the oceans is very much an 
international field in which many countries

02:06.813 --> 02:23.640
share in exchange of information dealing with the 
ocean.

02:27.306 --> 02:33.175
Do you see the pushing of nations' boundaries out 
more deeply or further into the ocean? as a threat

02:33.593 --> 02:35.676
to your particular academic history. Well, it 
makes it more difficult. Yes, the oceanography is

02:38.720 --> 02:50.257
getting more involved in problems of the

02:38.720 --> 02:50.257
jurisdiction over the sea, yes. Do you feel as if 
perhaps that these international conferences

02:53.101 --> 03:01.913
will aid in this sort of thing, us being allowed and 
they being allowed to work closer on the

02:53.101 --> 03:01.913
continental shelves? are closer to boundaries? 
Well, in principle, it could. At the moment, it

03:08.701 --> 03:13.133
isn't obvious that it is helpful.

03:17.945 --> 03:18.366
Excuse me. The next series of questions I should 
like to ask have to do with your opinions of

03:20.033 --> 03:32.165
education in oceanography and possibly the 
future of oceanography, or oceanography's

03:20.033 --> 03:32.165
contribution to the future, if I could. Do you see 
any marked change in terms of education of

03:33.566 --> 03:39.712
oceanographers that has occurred in the last 15 or 
20 years?

03:47.039 --> 03:48.741
Let's see. There's always a continuing change in 
education in the sense that there is no dogma,

03:49.784 --> 04:06.923
no routine.

04:06.983 --> 04:10.788
The whole oceanography is a developing field. And 
the education of oceanographers goes along with

04:11.108 --> 04:17.215
the development of knowledge. So it's 
continually changing. And I mean, that's basic.

04:23.387 --> 04:24.188
That's basic. I'm not sure that answers your 
question. Well, do you see the rise of

04:28.354 --> 04:36.888
oceanography departments as specific 
departments in academic institutions as

04:28.354 --> 04:36.888
essentially a good thing that's occurred the last 
several years? Oh, well, yes, in the sense that

04:39.231 --> 04:47.905
it's led to an increased knowledge of the ocean, 
I'm

04:49.032 --> 04:58.167
not sure what

04:49.032 --> 04:58.167
you're getting at. OK. Well, let me try to explain 
it more clearly. I'm struck by the way that the

05:01.593 --> 05:12.711
original development of oceanography had to do 
with people drifting into oceanography, if I may

05:01.593 --> 05:12.711
use that metaphor, from other academic 
disciplines and sort of developing

05:14.429 --> 05:24.018
from geophysics, from work in seismology, like 
Professor Shore next to you, or what have you, and

05:14.429 --> 05:24.018
then moving to a place like Scripps Institution 
and creating oceanography. And with the impact of

05:24.639 --> 05:32.506
ONR, in particular, and NSL after the war, there 
have been developed now specialized departments

05:24.639 --> 05:32.506
of oceanography. Yes.

05:37.831 --> 05:41.635
Along with this developed oceanography, there's 
a continuing flux of people from other fields,

05:42.290 --> 05:52.540
from physics, chemistry, mathematics, whatnot. 
There's a continuing flux of people from those

05:52.740 --> 05:58.785
fields into the oceanographic field. That hasn't 
stopped. In other words, people that are in

06:01.068 --> 06:08.955
oceanography don't come exclusively from these 
oceanographic departments.

06:13.542 --> 06:42.165
So

06:13.542 --> 06:42.165
let's say the existence of departments of 
oceanography and degrees being given in

06:13.542 --> 06:42.165
oceanography, to me, is not a fundamental change 
in the situation of education in oceanography, in

06:13.542 --> 06:42.165
part because the people Within the Department of 
Oceanography, the people that work within the

06:42.601 --> 06:59.966
Departments of Oceanography themselves are 
working in disciplines similar to in other

06:42.601 --> 06:59.966
non-oceanographic departments. They tend to be 
chemists, geologists, geophysicists,

06:59.986 --> 07:11.022
physicists working in oceanography.

07:11.508 --> 07:16.675
continue this kind of disciplinary studies right 
within the department. So this, to me, existence

07:17.336 --> 07:35.060
of departments of oceanography, to me, is not a 
fundamental departure, not a fundamental change

07:17.336 --> 07:35.060
in the science of oceanography.

07:35.080 --> 07:39.286
Is it possible that there are too many departments 
of oceanography now? Oh. I couldn't answer that

07:41.275 --> 07:42.957
question. I don't think so. It would be, let's

07:46.462 --> 08:08.110
see, the growth of any field I think is better in 
many ways if growth by proliferation of

07:46.462 --> 08:08.110
institutions rather than few of them going to 
colossal size. One of the problems, I think, in

08:12.232 --> 08:19.860
oceanography is that ships are very expensive. 
And small oceanographic institutions would have

08:21.241 --> 08:30.010
a greater difficulty in keeping a ship going. Even 
a large institution like Scripps Institution,

08:31.972 --> 08:37.978
which is one of the largest possibly the largest, 
has difficulty maintaining its fleet of ships.

08:46.285 --> 08:52.072
But there are some advantages, don't you see, in 
small institutions?

08:55.597 --> 08:56.077
Such as? Well, there's an advantage of more, let's 
say, simpler relations between the people

08:57.178 --> 09:06.109
involved in a more, kind of a more intimate contact 
among your people. When things get large, they get

09:08.705 --> 09:20.815
problems just because they are large, and 
problems of administration, for example.

09:20.835 --> 09:26.980
Was the establishment of the University of 
California at San Diego beneficial for Scripps? I

09:27.000 --> 09:28.061
think so, yes. I think, yes, that has the

09:28.141 --> 09:36.248
contact with the An expanded university's been 
beneficial to Scripps, in my opinion.

09:43.753 --> 09:47.999
Then there seems to be some perfect size you're 
speaking of. Is,

09:48.139 --> 09:56.572
in your opinion, Scripps Institution now too 
large? Oh, I'd hate to make an opinion about that.

10:01.799 --> 10:04.243
Some aspects of it, it's too large. I look with some 
nostalgia back in the period when I knew everybody

10:04.679 --> 10:10.728
here. And now I don't. I go to a gathering of people 
that they tell me are all from Christian

10:14.554 --> 10:21.284
institutions. I may know about 10% of them. So I 
think of the good old days when I knew everybody.

10:40.825 --> 10:53.019
The ocean has been looked upon, fortunately or 
unfortunately, in the 60s as a possible solution

10:40.825 --> 10:53.019
to man's problems in terms of food, mineral 
resources, and so forth. Are you optimistic about

10:53.039 --> 10:56.403
that sort of approach to the ocean?

11:00.328 --> 11:08.537
Let's say you're getting into a subject that, in my 
opinion, is really not worth much. The, yes, I

11:11.217 --> 11:27.635
think there have been

11:11.217 --> 11:27.635
maybe too much optimism about the, what some 
people almost think of as the inexhaustible

11:11.217 --> 11:27.635
resources of the sea.

11:32.140 --> 11:37.225
Let's see,

11:32.140 --> 11:37.225
and In some of those resources, I think we're 
already pushing pretty close to the limit. Some of

11:43.736 --> 11:52.650
the fish, fishing in the sea, for example, pretty 
clearly quails and so on. Many things that at one

11:52.670 --> 12:04.208
time looked like they were inexhaustible in the 
sea are now quite clearly not inexhaustible.

12:08.255 --> 12:30.079
So no, I don't look for a real tremendous

12:08.255 --> 12:30.079
development where the sea can provide almost 
limitless possibilities.

12:30.139 --> 12:37.367
There's

12:30.139 --> 12:37.367
some resources of the sea are not being utilized 
yet, for example, on the sea bottom. And there

12:41.815 --> 12:50.245
are projects for mining the deep sea floor, for 
example.

12:54.249 --> 12:58.695
I think you'd better ask somebody else about that 
field. What do you see as, may I call it, the future

12:58.855 --> 13:02.499
of oceanography? That is, what direction do you 
see your particular discipline taking? in the

13:06.423 --> 13:07.925
immediate future? Oh, I don't see it. It bothers me 
a little bit. The future seemed very clear to me at

13:16.997 --> 13:24.467
the end of the wars in 1946. The immediate future 
seemed very clear to me at that time. It doesn't

13:29.875 --> 13:31.897
seem so to me right now. Maybe that's because I'm 
old.

13:38.755 --> 13:40.357
don't really see it very clearly. There's always a 
hope, I think, that there'll be a breakthrough or

13:41.198 --> 13:49.569
some unforeseen development. All of the exciting 
things that have happened to me in my

13:50.110 --> 14:04.810
oceanographic life couldn't have been foreseen, 
couldn't have been thought of because they were

13:50.110 --> 14:04.810
discovered in the process. So when I say the thing 
seemed clear to me, it wasn't that I I predicted or

14:09.367 --> 14:13.972
imagined everything that was going to be 
discovered. But what I meant was what seemed clear

14:13.992 --> 14:17.116
was the way to go. And now it seems to you as if 
oceanography is spreading in many particular

14:17.136 --> 14:24.865
directions. I think the reason it isn't clear is 
it's much more complex now. And we're utilizing

14:29.431 --> 14:39.002
facilities and ideas that are much more complex 
than ones we've worked on 30 years ago, or 25 or

14:39.691 --> 14:48.659
whatever it was when I

14:39.691 --> 14:48.659
started. Okay. Now, what are your intentions in 
future research? Well, I'm sort of, it's hard for

14:53.804 --> 15:01.612
me to know how to go. I'm retired, you know. I 
retired a year ago. So I'm sort of... In a way, I have

15:08.378 --> 15:36.462
two, I think maybe one of my major 
responsibilities right now is just sort of

15:08.378 --> 15:36.462
cleaning house in a way, sort of winding up some of 
the things that I've been doing and trying to throw

15:08.378 --> 15:36.462
away a

15:08.378 --> 15:36.462
lot of the things that aren't aren't needed to hang 
on to. Some of the things that we've acquired in the

15:39.539 --> 15:52.535
process, and I think this is true of many fields of 
oceanography, you acquire, in a sense, archives.

15:54.657 --> 16:06.111
The biologists may have acquired a whole lot of 
specimens of things that they put in bottles of

15:54.657 --> 16:06.111
formaldehyde one time. And geologists collect 
rocks off the seafloor, and also cores of

16:06.378 --> 16:13.687
sediment. These are archives which are useful

16:14.187 --> 16:20.575
for people later on. Questions come up

16:21.896 --> 16:35.052
that can be solved by reference to these archives 
of material, the cores that that have been studied

16:35.707 --> 16:44.997
in a preliminary way that contain information 
that no one dreamed maybe was important at all at

16:35.707 --> 16:44.997
the time they did it. And our work here has similar 
archives. We have seismic records that are

16:50.323 --> 16:56.970
continuing to be useful to people. Many people 
come to examine details that, when we first look at

16:56.990 --> 17:02.997
them, We didn't have time or weren't even aware 
that they might be important. So I have some

17:09.598 --> 17:30.661
interest in cleaning up the archive so that the 
material that's useful will be retained and the

17:09.598 --> 17:30.661
stuff that isn't just in the way will be thrown away 
or put off to one side or just stacked up. There's a

17:30.681 --> 17:32.663
lot else to use. In addition to that, I'm still 
somewhat in demand to go to sea to participate in

17:33.925 --> 17:48.446
continuing work to be on contract proposals as an 
investigator and so on. So I'm continuing to do

17:48.466 --> 17:51.030
that. In fact, I'm on two coming expeditions, one 
going out in September, and I'm also going out in

17:51.510 --> 17:59.562
January. I hope the one in Journeyware is to the 
south. Well, it's almost the same place. The ship

18:06.561 --> 18:08.664
will still be there, you see. One of the things is it 
costs a good deal of money to get a ship out into that

18:08.744 --> 18:13.511
area. And the most interesting parts of the world 
to study are far from Scripps. And that isn't

18:22.784 --> 18:27.971
entirely because we've studied everything close 
by and we have to go further away. There are just a

18:27.991 --> 18:29.093
whole lot of more interesting geology and 
geophysics in areas like the Southeast Asia,

18:29.731 --> 18:38.700
which is a fascinating, very complex region. So 
complicated that it's only recently that people

18:38.720 --> 18:44.846
are getting into it, because it's very hard to 
understand. And the region that we're

18:46.548 --> 18:58.219
immediately adjacent to California, the region 
of the ocean right off here, is a simple,

18:46.548 --> 18:58.219
comparatively simple area.

19:01.068 --> 19:07.920
In terms of the field that we're doing, the 
geophysics of the ocean bottom.

19:08.060 --> 19:09.803
So we have our ship out there now. It's in Guam. It's 
coming into Guam very soon. It's the fifth. Monday

19:16.274 --> 19:18.537
it's coming into Guam. And then it's going to be out 
there for another six months on various

19:29.013 --> 19:31.227
before he comes back to San Diego.
