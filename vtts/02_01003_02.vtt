00:04.368 --> 00:13.778
This is an interview with Dr. William Alex 
McIntosh by Melanie Hopkins on November 20, 1988

00:04.368 --> 00:13.778
at Texas A&M University concerning the Vietnam 
War. In the interest of accumulating knowledge

00:13.798 --> 00:20.666
about this war, I am going to donate this tape to 
Texas A&M oral history collection in the

00:13.798 --> 00:20.666
university archives. Is that all right with you? 
That's fine. Would you tell me about your place and

00:22.929 --> 00:25.431
date of birth? Okay, I was born in Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin, November 12, 1943. Okay, and what is

00:30.817 --> 00:33.160
your educational background? a Ph.D. in 
sociology that I got at Iowa State in 1975. And

00:39.850 --> 00:44.314
prior to that, I got a master's degree at the same 
school in sociology. And prior to that, in the

00:45.235 --> 00:56.808
spring of 1967, I got a degree, a bachelor of 
science in political science from the University

00:45.235 --> 00:56.808
of California, Berkeley. What was your 
connection with the Vietnam War? graduated, as I

01:01.203 --> 01:03.566
said, in March 67. I left, actually left school, 
finished my coursework in December of 1966.

01:13.518 --> 01:23.289
At that time, everybody was being drafted after 
four years of college, regardless of whether or

01:13.518 --> 01:23.289
not they had a degree or not. And I knew at that time, 
my student deferment would soon be up. And I had

01:29.587 --> 01:37.876
prior to finishing school, had looked into the 
Peace Corps and had found some information on an

01:29.587 --> 01:37.876
organization called International Voluntary 
Services. I applied to both. I was very interested

01:40.198 --> 01:49.408
in going to someplace in Southeast Asia to work for 
a couple of reasons. One, I had taken a lot of

01:49.568 --> 01:57.296
courses on Southeast Asia and so wanted to see what 
it was like firsthand. And secondly, sort of felt

02:00.704 --> 02:09.015
ambivalent about the war, wanted to serve my 
country, but at the same time not participate in

02:00.704 --> 02:09.015
the war itself. And so I was hoping to work in 
Southeast Asia in a peaceful kind of setting, or

02:09.836 --> 02:19.368
working in peaceful means. Peace Corps offered me 
a couple of possibilities. One was in Tibet, which

02:25.396 --> 02:30.222
is not in Southeast Asia, so I turned that down, and 
the other was in the Philippines. It was teaching

02:30.488 --> 02:32.530
English, and I didn't want to do that. And also, the 
Philippines is a Catholic country, and I wanted to

02:33.431 --> 02:44.642
work in a country that was non-Christian just to 
have some exposure to a different religion.

02:45.563 --> 02:53.251
International Voluntary Services interviewed 
me in December of 1966, offered me a job early in

02:45.563 --> 02:53.251
1967. I said yes. My eagerness to become a part of 
this organization was heightened by having a

03:00.627 --> 03:22.476
physical exam, being called in for a physical by 
the military forces, passing that with flying

03:00.627 --> 03:22.476
colors and being told that I could expect to be 
called up within a short period after having

03:00.627 --> 03:22.476
passed this physical. So I worked something out 
with my draft board. They basically said that I

03:26.201 --> 03:28.204
could spend two years with International 
Volunteer Services. At that time, I thought I was

03:31.586 --> 03:34.570
going to Vietnam. But they say after that two-year 
period, then they would draft me. Well, I thought,

03:39.737 --> 03:45.485
I'll go to Vietnam, do something positive there. 
And maybe in the meantime, something positive

03:45.505 --> 03:50.733
will happen with regard to the outcome of the war. 
About a month before I was supposed to go, for

03:57.175 --> 04:03.924
training that would start in Washington, end up in 
the Philippines, and then I would go to Vietnam. I

04:03.944 --> 04:09.351
got a telegram saying that they had too many people 
going to Vietnam, not enough going to Laos. And I

04:09.371 --> 04:10.352
had a choice. I could either go to Laos, or I could 
wait and go to Vietnam in June. I felt that if I

04:15.939 --> 04:18.623
waited, I would be drafted. And so I said, I'll go to 
Laos.

04:25.711 --> 04:29.296
Like I said, March was the start of training. I 
spent two weeks in Washington every day, kinds of

04:29.396 --> 04:46.160
meetings, meeting with former volunteers, 
members of the State Department, historians,

04:29.396 --> 04:46.160
anthropologists, did a little role playing, that 
kind of thing. We were then taken to the

04:46.641 --> 04:55.313
Philippines, spent approximately a month at the 
International Rice Research Institute, in the

04:56.896 --> 05:03.482
Philippines, a little town called Los Banos that I 
don't remember. We were trained how to grow one of

05:03.862 --> 05:09.347
the miracle rice varieties. Was also given some 
training in well digging and water seal toilet

05:09.848 --> 05:16.013
construction. And then some, we had a lot of 
lectures on community development and that sort

05:17.234 --> 05:22.279
of thing. Was then shipped to Laos and spent 
another couple of months in language training and

05:26.107 --> 05:35.638
again was given some training in well digging, 
that sort of thing. We were flown around the

05:36.479 --> 05:51.036
country and shown various projects that other 
volunteers were doing and then after being there a

05:36.479 --> 05:51.036
couple of months we were all given our 
assignments. I was assigned to a program called a

05:51.877 --> 05:55.742
forward area program And let me take this all back a 
step or two. International Voluntary Services

06:02.203 --> 06:07.027
had a contract with the U.S. government. We were 
contracted by the U.S. Agency for International

06:07.208 --> 06:22.742
Development to be basically the field 
representatives of AID in local communities.

06:22.975 --> 06:24.717
Currently, this was done for a couple of reasons. 
One, there had been a big foreign aid scandal back

06:25.077 --> 06:27.940
in 1958. And Laos was part of that scandal, where a 
lot of money was kind of flowing into the top with no

06:28.620 --> 06:34.046
accountability. And so money for things like 
extending the airport to make it into a quote

06:34.766 --> 06:43.395
unquote international airfield. You know, the 
actual bags of cement were stolen. So the victory

06:46.938 --> 06:52.003
monument, a victory monument to show that the Lao 
had had defeated the French and thrown off the

06:52.456 --> 06:57.664
bonds of colonialism back in 1954. So this 
monument could be built, and it was built exactly

06:57.945 --> 07:05.277
one meter taller than the French victory 
monument. But at any rate, the cement for that came

07:06.659 --> 07:11.627
stolen basically from this project. Well, at any 
rate, there was a big scandal over this, and there

07:11.847 --> 07:17.957
was some debate over whether or not aid should be 
continued For this country, on the other hand,

07:18.798 --> 07:21.862
there was a civil war going on. One side was 
communist, the other side was sort of right-wing

07:22.303 --> 07:39.144
to neutralist, and so I guess the Congress decided 
that it was important to continue to give the

07:22.303 --> 07:39.144
right-wing and neutralists foreign aid, but 
there had to be a lot more strings attached, more

07:22.303 --> 07:39.144
controls. And so what was set up was a kind of, what 
one of my friends characterized as a parallel

07:39.745 --> 07:48.096
government in which from the ambassador all the 
way down, to the village level where a lot of the

07:48.548 --> 08:00.704
money and materiel was going for projects, there 
would be an American pair of hens from the top all

07:48.548 --> 08:00.704
the way to the bottom. So the Lao never really had a 
chance to steal from this program because they

08:00.744 --> 08:09.215
never had a hold of it. There was somebody at the 
bottom who supervised disbursement of things

08:09.996 --> 08:17.205
generally for the for community development 
projects. Okay, back to IVS and my assignment. I

08:25.779 --> 08:28.822
was assigned to a program called Forward Area 
Program. The Forward Area Program was an AID

08:29.323 --> 08:42.438
brainchild that located always a young, male, 
American, single, the person had to be single.

08:43.459 --> 08:44.340
They would be placed in an area that had just been 
taken out of the hands of the communists. And the

08:49.865 --> 09:13.399
idea was that if you had put somebody into this 
area, they would be a funnel for rapid supplies of

08:49.865 --> 09:13.399
aid, you know, rapid influx of cement, roofing 
tin, nails, bolts, so on and so forth, so you could

08:49.865 --> 09:13.399
build schools, dig wells, build markets, you 
know, whatever local people wanted There would be

09:13.683 --> 09:30.961
somebody there, and the usual red tape in terms of 
getting the Lao government to sign all kinds of

09:13.683 --> 09:30.961
forms and AID to sign all kinds of forms that other 
people experienced, all of that was cut to a

09:13.683 --> 09:30.961
minimum so that there could be an immediate high 
impact. And the idea was to, in essence,

09:31.822 --> 09:42.694
demonstrate to people that the Lao government, 
through help of the American government, was

09:31.822 --> 09:42.694
really interested in and local people. And so 
you'd have a bunch of, you know, you'd have people

09:44.289 --> 09:57.684
who were being exposed to, you know, this massive 
amount of aid, you know, after having just lived

09:44.289 --> 09:57.684
under the communists so that they would have this 
contrast. You know, they would have this mental

09:58.225 --> 10:12.040
comparison that they would be making about what it 
was like, you know, under the communists versus

09:58.225 --> 10:12.040
the American-backed royal government. 
Apparently not very much because there was not

10:13.252 --> 10:21.128
very much for them that the communists had to give. 
In fact, the communists apparently mostly

10:21.168 --> 10:34.315
redistributed property, drafted people into the 
army, their army, lived off You know, they paid

10:35.206 --> 10:41.672
peasants, for instance, in script for rice and 
things that they ate. But in general, they had very

10:41.712 --> 10:43.894
little to give. They mostly took. But that was 
also, to a degree, true of the other side. The other

10:51.641 --> 11:03.171
side kind of preyed on locals,

10:51.641 --> 11:03.171
sometimes unofficially, because the Americans 
supposedly were paying all the bills, and so there

10:51.641 --> 11:03.171
was no reason to extract rice or anything else from 
local people. But there were always lots of abuses

11:07.457 --> 11:13.083
of that because it was, you know, it's hard to 
monitor what goes on. And I saw personally, you

11:14.405 --> 11:29.462
know, instances where a local military commander 
would basically exploit peasants because he had

11:14.405 --> 11:29.462
troops that he could use to, to back up any claims 
that he might have on somebody's land. And there

11:33.922 --> 11:36.305
was very little that people could do about it. I got 
involved in a couple of local disputes in terms of a

11:37.988 --> 11:46.900
commander making demands on locals. And the word 
filtered through the grapevine back to me that the

11:47.021 --> 11:55.052
guy would have me killed if I continued to do it. So I 
had the choice of either moving learning to work

11:59.075 --> 12:11.091
within the system, and I felt as though anywhere I 
went I would run into the same problem, that I would

11:59.075 --> 12:11.091
just have to keep my nose out of those sorts of 
things. At any rate, the forward area program was

12:11.111 --> 12:16.158
sort of blatantly a political kind of thing. Yeah, 
it was, in fact, the guy who ran the program was a

12:18.601 --> 12:28.575
retired Marine colonel who had spent all of his 
time or the majority of his career in the Marines in

12:30.158 --> 12:35.663
Southeast Asia, in China. He was highly 
experienced. He had a master's degree in

12:38.065 --> 12:43.229
anthropology, but he was very hard-nosed. And in 
fact, when I left the country, he had decided that

12:43.990 --> 12:52.937
this winning hearts and minds was probably less 
important. He basically said, if you grab them by

12:52.997 --> 12:59.743
their privates, their hearts and minds will 
follow, which was a phrase that he had picked up

13:00.010 --> 13:05.577
from, you know, that had been a phrase floating 
around Vietnam, apparently, for quite some time.

13:05.597 --> 13:14.127
And he had sort of switched his orientation, or at 
least verbally was changing the way he dealt with

13:05.597 --> 13:14.127
people who worked for him. At any rate, the reason I 
mention this is because when I joined this

13:15.649 --> 13:27.503
organization, one of the things that appealed to 
me was that it was, because it was a private

13:15.649 --> 13:27.503
organization, it could claim that it was 
nonpolitical, nonsectarian, so on and so forth.

13:35.509 --> 13:43.558
Well, political in the 1960s had a very specific 
meaning, or at least it did when a lot of us read that

13:35.509 --> 13:43.558
word and volunteered. It meant, well, you know, 
this organization is neutral, and so even though

13:44.059 --> 13:57.574
we knew we were working for the American 
government, we, I think, all kind of naively had

13:44.059 --> 13:57.574
the impression that we would be able to... you 
know, to basically do strictly community

13:59.377 --> 14:03.461
development kinds of things. And, you know, if it 
made somebody look good, then that was just kind of

14:03.661 --> 14:12.530
an afterthought or a lucky byproduct. But, you 
know, we were, for the most part, interested in

14:12.550 --> 14:21.459
helping people regardless of, you know, who 
looked good as a consequence.

14:24.042 --> 14:27.105
But the organization was formed in the 1950s and 
the non-political and non-sectarian

14:27.845 --> 14:33.271
terminology was developed then. And what many of 
us came to discover was that non-political simply

14:33.711 --> 14:43.902
meant that the organization didn't go after 
Republicans or Democrats. They were after young

14:43.922 --> 14:47.566
Americans to go do this field work. It was a very 
political organization in the first sense that I

14:47.586 --> 14:55.995
was talking about because everything that we did 
had to be approved by AID and AID was only

14:56.465 --> 15:17.104
interested in things that would benefit the local 
people but at the same time give credit to the Lao

14:56.465 --> 15:17.104
government and also not shake any of the social 
structure or economic structure up in any

14:56.465 --> 15:17.104
particular way. In other words, don't do anything 
that as a consequence would make the government

15:19.752 --> 15:26.318
look bad or cause people to question economic 
arrangements. It was permissible to make people

15:27.058 --> 15:36.926
better off economically, but not at somebody 
else's expense, so on and so forth.

15:38.127 --> 15:40.329
I was kind of offended by all this. I know there's a 
lot to talk about, but one of the things I'm going to

15:40.529 --> 15:49.557
mention is that when I got there, I was so upset by 
having felt like I had been hoodwinked that I

15:50.026 --> 15:54.752
started a letter writing campaign. And I got a 
bunch of other volunteers who were kind of

15:56.375 --> 16:03.945
appalled by this whole thing to write letters as 
well. And we, within a year, had gotten this

16:04.806 --> 16:15.280
program killed, at least in the sense that they 
weren't going to send any more IVS volunteers into

16:04.806 --> 16:15.280
the forward area program. And we were We did it for a 
couple reasons. One, because it was highly

16:18.994 --> 16:23.240
political, and two, it was very unsafe. The day I 
arrived in the country to begin my language

16:23.520 --> 16:29.328
training, they brought a body out. Some kid had 
been shot in his sleep. He had been warned, but had

16:32.693 --> 16:47.573
decided that he had enough personal contacts in 
the local area that in essence people would

16:32.693 --> 16:47.573
intervene and he wouldn't be Well, he turned out to 
be wrong and was apparently shot while he slept in

16:47.975 --> 16:54.785
his bed. And during the time I was there, I lost 
about six friends because they were, in essence,

16:56.708 --> 17:13.273
assassinated because of their connection to the 
American effort, which was connected to one

16:56.708 --> 17:13.273
particular side in this conflict. And so that was 
the second reason for trying to kill this program,

17:13.928 --> 17:18.933
because it was dangerous as hell. My first 
assignment was in a

17:19.334 --> 17:28.103
place in the southern part of the country near the 
Ho Chi Minh Trail. It was never safe enough for me to

17:28.643 --> 17:32.287
go to work there. In fact, it was never safe enough 
for me to even visit. In fact, they kept me in limbo

17:37.152 --> 17:41.016
for a while until... such time that they thought it 
was going to be safe. And in the meantime, I got

17:46.284 --> 17:49.067
involved in other things. But I think that was kind 
of indicative of the kind of program it was. They

17:54.092 --> 17:56.554
put you in very unsafe conditions. They did give 
you all kinds of radios and something that was

17:57.155 --> 18:02.940
termed a bug-out bag. We had a bag that had an 
air-to-ground radio, a portable

18:02.960 --> 18:10.648
single-sideband radio that was connected via an 
aerial and batteries to radios of a similar type

18:10.983 --> 18:22.196
within about 200 to 300 miles. And with that kind of 
radius, in most parts of Laos, you could not only

18:23.959 --> 18:35.552
raise other people with similar radios inside 
Laos, but you could even reach people in Thailand.

18:35.572 --> 18:39.437
And so it felt like if you had to leave in a hurry and 
go hide in the jungle. We had all these radios that

18:42.641 --> 18:47.167
you can utilize to get yourself out of the dam. They 
didn't give us weapons. And in fact, our

18:49.129 --> 18:58.880
organization

18:49.129 --> 18:58.880
basically told us, if you are working in a place 
where you feel like you need to be armed, then you

18:49.129 --> 18:58.880
shouldn't be working there. But that was always 
kind of a catch-22, because a good deal of the

18:59.101 --> 19:08.732
places we worked had the chance over time not to be 
unsafe, particularly the longer you were there,

19:09.083 --> 19:14.048
the more impact you might have. And that was 
eventually going to draw somebody's attention.

19:19.634 --> 19:25.259
So for the most part, the people that I knew that 
were working in the country stayed unarmed. I

19:25.359 --> 19:26.420
never armed myself. But one of the guys I worked 
with had his father send him through the

19:26.480 --> 19:33.768
government mail a pistol. He had a .22 Magnum 
pistol. and kept under his pillow. At any rate,

19:43.299 --> 19:53.315
what I did there, well, I was supposed to be in this 
forward area program. The place I was initially

19:53.596 --> 19:58.744
assigned in the South was never safe enough for me 
to visit. I finally convinced people to let me work

19:59.705 --> 20:04.453
someplace else, at least temporarily. They were 
going to have me sit on my hands, I guess, forever.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.591
And I was young and eager, and I wanted to get 
started. I'd been in training for three months. I

20:13.234 --> 20:22.827
had, in essence, a year and nine months left, so I 
wanted to get started on being a volunteer. So I

20:23.548 --> 20:30.737
found out that there were a couple of guys working 
in the oldest forward area in the program in the

20:23.548 --> 20:30.737
country. In fact, it was... old and safe enough so 
that they were going to change its status and they

20:33.492 --> 20:53.345
were going to start moving couples into there and 
have men and women, married couples, again,

20:33.492 --> 20:53.345
Americans for the most part, live and work there 
and do, you know, kind of a broader range of

20:33.492 --> 20:53.345
activities. You know, more red tape wouldn't take 
us long, but, you know, it was thought that this

20:53.846 --> 20:58.774
particular area had been you know, receiving high 
impact long enough, and it was time to kind of slow

20:59.412 --> 21:05.718
things down and go through normal channels. The 
guys that were working there had a, for the most

21:07.961 --> 21:14.047
part, a well digging program going on. That was 
about the only thing that they, there had been a lot

21:14.087 --> 21:24.178
of schools and that stuff built already, and so 
about the only thing that was left that local

21:14.087 --> 21:24.178
people seemed to be interested in was having 
wells. So I volunteered to go work with the two guys

21:25.957 --> 21:28.300
that were working there. One was a guy from 
England, and another was a guy from the States

21:28.400 --> 21:33.947
somewhere. And I thought, if I just work with them, 
at least I get some experience in the field, get to

21:35.249 --> 21:47.085
practice my language, and then in the meantime, 
maybe where I was supposed to go would get safe, or

21:35.249 --> 21:47.085
maybe they would reassign me, but at least I 
wouldn't be sitting on my hands. So I went out on the

21:47.986 --> 21:55.896
field with the Englishman, the American, whose 
name was Jerry Lewis, of all things, I was on

21:56.129 --> 21:59.953
vacation, so I slept down on Terry's cot. We were 
renting the upstairs floor of a wooden building. A

22:05.380 --> 22:08.163
Chinese family owned this building. They lived on 
the ground floor. Their store was on the ground

22:11.426 --> 22:12.848
floor. That's how they made their living. And then 
we rented the upstairs. And the upstairs was a

22:16.352 --> 22:21.338
great big... It was just like a dormitory in some 
sense. It was a very big building. We had a kitchen.

22:26.938 --> 22:29.661
We had kind of a meeting room, living room. There 
was one bedroom that the two volunteers slept in.

22:34.287 --> 22:44.498
And then there was a kind of a long dormitory type 
room in which a couple of Thai engineers and some

22:34.287 --> 22:44.498
trainees that worked for them lived. And those 
individuals were involved in building dams in

22:44.658 --> 22:49.744
that area. So there was a lot of stuff going on. At 
any rate, I was there four days and on the night On

22:55.259 --> 23:03.632
the fourth day, somebody came into our backyard, 
the path at Leno, and fired a rocket at our open

22:55.259 --> 23:03.632
window. Missed it. The rocket went through there, 
pierced the kitchen wall, hit a frying pan

23:05.454 --> 23:16.431
apparently hanging on the kitchen wall and 
exploded, destroying the kitchen, setting the

23:05.454 --> 23:16.431
place on fire. And then some other individuals put 
about 22 rounds of AK-47 fire in about floor level,

23:25.516 --> 23:30.461
hoping to hit us in our cots. The bullets came in at 
an angle, and by the time they were near us, they

23:32.102 --> 23:42.372
were already on their way out of the room through 
the ceiling. So none of us were hit directly by

23:42.452 --> 23:46.535
these bullets. One of the bullets, however, 
ricocheted down and hit the Englishman who was

23:46.615 --> 23:54.763
sleeping next to me in a cot in the back. Apparently 
the bullet had lost a lot of steam by this time, and

23:54.963 --> 24:03.471
so what he got was a kind of a long flesh wound down 
his back. Another bullet ricocheted and hit one of

24:04.312 --> 24:19.326
the Thai engineers in the foot, and then a third 
bullet ricocheted and hit a kid in the body who was a

24:04.312 --> 24:19.326
Chinese child who was living with his family below 
us. So there were three people wounded. We were

24:22.975 --> 24:29.686
evacuated at 6 in the morning by basically a 
military helicopter that had flown from

24:22.975 --> 24:29.686
Thailand. It was an American military helicopter 
who flew us out. We were unable to get out any sooner

24:36.017 --> 24:40.424
because it was dark, and we also were having 
trouble. This was 11 at night when all of this

24:40.945 --> 24:44.350
happened. We were also having trouble with our 
radio.

24:48.895 --> 24:49.696
Let's see. And then I did a lot of odd jobs around the 
country, worked two or three other places. Two of

24:57.328 --> 25:05.600
the other places I worked, I stayed in for, in one 
place, 14 months, another place about nine

24:57.328 --> 25:05.600
months. Both became so unsafe that I had to 
eventually leave. I spent most of my time doing

25:10.167 --> 25:17.738
things like, again, digging some wells, building 
a market, helped in a rice demonstration program,

25:18.173 --> 25:32.990
and then bought rice from local people, that kind 
of thing. What experiences did you have with the

25:33.231 --> 25:37.075
U.S. government? Well, I was a direct employee 
because of our contract. I was supervised in the

25:41.620 --> 25:47.387
field basically by AID, personnel all the people I 
work for turn out were former Peace Corps

25:47.890 --> 26:15.957
volunteers and so while they weren't necessarily 
neutral with regard to the war at least they

25:47.890 --> 26:15.957
understood what it meant to be a volunteer and they 
tried to give us as much autonomy as possible but at

25:47.890 --> 26:15.957
the same time you know this business of war was 
always very close at hand because Again, we were

26:17.152 --> 26:41.269
associated with the U.S. government backed side, 
excuse me, of things, doing programs that were

26:17.152 --> 26:41.269
designed to, in essence, shore up the popularity, 
increase the popularity of the royal Lao

26:17.152 --> 26:41.269
government, which was at war with a communist 
side. And the communists Lao forces were

26:46.008 --> 26:51.316
supported by Vietnamese communists. So it was, in 
many senses, an extinction of the Vietnam War.

26:57.906 --> 27:05.598
There were about 40,000 troops from Vietnam 
stationed in Laos backing up the path at Lao. That

27:05.658 --> 27:11.948
was the name of the communist group in Laos.

27:14.459 --> 27:25.031
And a good deal of the ferocity of what went on there 
was due to the fact that the Vietnamese were there

27:14.459 --> 27:25.031
to win. The Lao were always on both sides fairly 
hang loose. But the fact that you had Americans

27:31.599 --> 27:43.032
pushing one side and the Vietnamese pushing the 
other tended to make the war probably worse than it

27:31.599 --> 27:43.032
would have been had these two sides been fighting 
on their own. In fact, I suspect it would have

27:45.560 --> 27:52.627
ended, it went on 25 years before the Vietnamese 
basically won. But I think it would have ended a lot

27:53.628 --> 28:00.035
sooner had there not been two outside parties, 
basically. Sort of like a fight in which two people

28:00.255 --> 28:11.567
are fighting one another and at a point they would 
both like to quit, but there are too many people

28:00.255 --> 28:11.567
that are egging them on, so they're unable to quit. 
Uh, so I, you know, work on a daily basis,

28:12.644 --> 28:18.632
basically, for the American government. I had to 
make radio check twice a day to let people know that

28:18.652 --> 28:23.459
I was all right. And if you didn't, if you failed to 
make radio check, then they would send Air America

28:24.920 --> 28:37.978
planes out to search for you, because the 
assumption was that if you made radio check,

28:24.920 --> 28:37.978
something didn't make it, you know, something was 
wrong. And if it turned out you didn't make radio

28:39.160 --> 28:41.723
check because, uh, you know, had gotten drunk or 
just, you know, slept through it, or just, you

28:42.327 --> 28:52.757
know, got busy and forgot, then you had to pay for 
the airtime. And the little aircraft costs $100 an

28:52.777 --> 28:59.744
hour, and the larger ones $200 an hour. There was 
somebody who had done exactly this and wound up

29:00.304 --> 29:08.672
owing the American government close to $1,000. 
which was taken out of his $80 a month for the rest of

29:08.770 --> 29:13.617
the time it was there. The reason that our safety, 
as it turns out, was such a big deal was because, as

29:15.159 --> 29:38.592
we were told by the ambassador, the American 
ambassador to the country towards the end of my

29:15.159 --> 29:38.592
stay there, that they didn't want deaths of young 
Americans appearing in American newspapers

29:38.977 --> 29:42.842
because people would start saying, well, wait a 
minute, this kid was killed in Laos. Don't we have a

29:42.902 --> 29:44.904
treaty of neutrality with those people? What's 
going on here? And then somebody would call up

29:47.267 --> 29:51.051
their congressman and say, look, what's going on? 
A kid from my state or my child was killed in Laos,

29:51.392 --> 29:55.476
was shot. How come? We're supposed to be, you know, 
we're not at war there. We signed this treaty of

29:59.381 --> 30:00.883
neutrality. What's going on? So we were told, you 
know, fairly bluntly, we want to keep you alive

30:02.104 --> 30:07.971
because we don't want... anybody raising 
questions. And any time one of us was killed, Radio

30:10.213 --> 30:21.165
Moscow would announce it as the assassination of a 
member of the CIA. Every time one of my friends was

30:21.185 --> 30:32.037
killed, that's how their death was publicized

30:21.185 --> 30:32.037
by that side. We got a member of the CIA.

30:38.140 --> 31:07.438
we were, none of us, or at least the people I knew, I 
wasn't a member of the CIA, and the organization I

30:38.140 --> 31:07.438
worked for, IVS, was very careful to try to avoid 
that kind of infiltration, but there was always

30:38.140 --> 31:07.438
some suspicion on our part that because there were 
some people in IVS who were very ideological and

30:38.140 --> 31:07.438
very involved in the war, very interested in it, 
that there might be some people who were in the

30:38.140 --> 31:07.438
employ of the CIA, and we weren't so worried that 
they were spying on us. We just were concerned that

31:09.407 --> 31:28.592
they might, in essence, do things that would 
simply reinforce the image that, well, these are

31:09.407 --> 31:28.592
no more than American employees, even though they 
call themselves members of IBS and they claim to be

31:09.407 --> 31:28.592
independent volunteers. They're just, in 
effect, the same thing, the CIA, and so it's OK to

31:29.173 --> 31:35.181
kill them. There was a great effort to try to 
separate ourselves as much as possible from the

31:35.903 --> 31:54.790
American government, despite the fact that we 
were working in an American government program,

31:35.903 --> 31:54.790
because we were trying to minimize the jeopardy 
that people's lives were in. And again, frankly, a

31:54.830 --> 32:03.362
lot of us were there not because of the propaganda 
value that we posed, but rather just to try to help

31:54.830 --> 32:03.362
people. people regardless of who they're credit 
for. Did you have any, do you know of any whatever

32:07.920 --> 32:11.983
that was involved in CIA? Did you ever run into any? 
Well, it turns out that the Air America, which was

32:13.024 --> 32:33.923
supposedly a private firm, I learned, in fact this 
was in Newsweek and a lot of news

32:13.024 --> 32:33.923
broadcasts and so on and so forth a couple of years 
after I came back from Southeast Asia. It turned

32:35.101 --> 32:38.065
out that it was a dummy corporation owned by the 
CIA. So in other words, the people that flew us all

32:38.225 --> 32:50.840
over the country, we flew around the country 
because of either there not being any road

32:38.225 --> 32:50.840
transportation, and so your only choice was to fly 
in and out of areas where you work, or because it was

32:38.225 --> 32:50.840
too unsafe. And I flew generally because of a 
combination of those two. And so in that regard, we

32:56.707 --> 33:02.053
had that kind of connection. There were a lot of 
stories that the CIA was working very closely with

33:02.371 --> 33:16.548
the embassy, and it was very clear that the embassy 
was having a lot to say about how the aid program was

33:02.371 --> 33:16.548
working. And so I'm sure that inadvertently we had 
lots of contact with the CIA. We just didn't know

33:24.037 --> 33:29.543
about it, to kind of give you an illustration of... 
you know, how closely tied to the embassy we were.

33:31.979 --> 33:44.991
One time, one person who worked for us, Lau, was 
killed, shot on the way back to the house we were all

33:31.979 --> 33:44.991
living in. He'd been working in a village, and he 
had decided to walk with one other guy. It was about

33:52.618 --> 33:59.344
a 10-mile walk, and he got within about four miles 
of where we lived, And somebody came out from some

33:59.797 --> 34:06.343
bushes, a couple of people, with automatic 
weapons and shot at he and this other guy. The other

34:06.363 --> 34:08.365
guy was able to escape. He was hit in the head almost 
immediately, died instantly.

34:15.792 --> 34:27.103
We took his body back to the Capitol so he could be 
cremated and so his family, who were from another

34:15.792 --> 34:27.103
part of the country, could have a funeral. And then 
I flew back in with my immediate aid supervisor to

34:28.147 --> 34:39.943
see how he wanted to fly in to make sure everything 
was okay before he left me there. And apparently

34:41.105 --> 34:54.323
another Lauer who was working for us, who was 
making radio check while everybody was gone, had

34:41.105 --> 34:54.323
reported some kind of fighting nearby. We 
frequently reported that, not because we were

34:54.691 --> 35:05.966
trying to gather information, but we were 
basically trying to get somebody to tell us, gee,

34:54.691 --> 35:05.966
that body's awfully close to you, maybe you ought 
to come out of there. In other words, we frequently

35:05.986 --> 35:19.244
reported that kind of thing just to get some kind of 
check from somebody who knew about military

35:05.986 --> 35:19.244
matters as to whether or not we were safe. And he 
apparently reported some kind of attack on a

35:19.264 --> 35:23.770
village... And he either garbled it or the person 
monitoring this call garbled it. But at any rate,

35:32.326 --> 35:33.768
we landed. We made radio checks saying we got 
there. And apparently, as we were making this

35:37.572 --> 35:52.609
radio check, there was a squadron of these old 
World War II aircraft that had been ordered by the

35:37.572 --> 35:52.609
American ambassador to do a bombing raid on our 
where we were living because somehow this gobble

35:53.045 --> 36:15.627
radio message had come out that I was there, the 
other American that I know was there, we were

35:53.045 --> 36:15.627
trapped in our house, we were surrounded by Path at 
Lowe, and so these guys were going to come in and do a

35:53.045 --> 36:15.627
bombing round around our home. Well, around our 
home were a lot of civilian houses, and so

36:15.647 --> 36:21.212
somebody... put two and two together and 
realized, well, if we had just flown in, we could

36:21.698 --> 36:25.683
hardly be under attack. And we had, you know, we 
called in and said we had just flown in and hadn't

36:25.703 --> 36:38.318
said that things were abnormal until somebody 
realized, hey, we're going to, you know, we're

36:25.703 --> 36:38.318
sending somebody to bomb and those guys are okay. 
And so they managed to call off this attack. But in

36:42.683 --> 36:47.729
essence, that kind of illustrates how closely 
tied we were with the American effort. And since

36:47.749 --> 36:50.592
the CIA was highly involved in What was going on 
there, and it turns out, incidentally, that AID

36:51.263 --> 37:10.430
was used as kind of a cover since it was, you know, 
AID is a branch of the State Department, but it was

36:51.263 --> 37:10.430
being used in Laos as a funnel for military aid. We 
had signed a treaty of neutrality in 1962 saying

37:11.571 --> 37:16.258
that we wouldn't give aid to any side, But we were 
still buying, basically giving the Lao

37:16.643 --> 37:25.053
government all of its weapons and even its 
uniforms. We were buying uniforms from Hong Kong,

37:25.073 --> 37:33.062
and they were being shipped to the country so that 
the Lao government would have a military that had

37:25.073 --> 37:33.062
uniforms. We were paying for all the food in the 
military. We were paying everybody's salary. It

37:38.087 --> 37:46.617
was basically a war that was paid for by us, but we 
had signed this treaty saying that we weren't

37:38.087 --> 37:46.617
supposed to do that, so it all had to be in some sort 
of bookkeeping fashion, be accounted for in terms

37:47.002 --> 38:01.057
of, I suppose, Rice, Roofington, who knows how 
they did it. But at any rate, so it's easy to see, at

38:01.798 --> 38:16.114
least from my standpoint, why we were targets, 
because we were part of this program that was

38:01.798 --> 38:16.114
military, that was CIA, so on and so forth.
