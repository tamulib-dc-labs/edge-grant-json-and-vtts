00:19.611 --> 00:24.517
This is testing, testing, testing, testing, 
testing. Hello. Testing here. Okay. This is

00:29.343 --> 00:32.909
September the 4th, I believe. And we are in room 207 
of the Evans Library, and I have the pleasure and

00:34.651 --> 00:50.676
honor of chatting with Dr. Paige Morgan, a 
longtime neighbor and friend, and today we're

00:34.651 --> 00:50.676
chatting about his... experiences as an A&M 
former student. Paige, to begin with, introduce

00:54.567 --> 01:00.393
yourself to anyone who might listen or read a 
transcript. Describe family background,

01:00.934 --> 01:05.799
growing up, where'd you go to high school. Just 
talk about yourself before you came to A&M. So, my

01:10.325 --> 01:15.210
name is Paige Wesley Morgan. I grew up in the area 
around Wichita Falls, Texas, although I was born

01:21.419 --> 01:22.660
in Arizona. My mother was a member of an old 
ranching family in northwest Texas and I went to

01:23.682 --> 01:32.552
high school in Iowa Park. It was a small place but 
had a fairly progressive high school. I got to take

01:39.460 --> 01:43.545
algebra and trigonometry and uh, chemistry and 
some things like that in high school. So that was

01:48.568 --> 01:51.993
all very positive. And, uh, early on then, I guess I 
was influenced by being in the 4-H club and, and,

01:53.135 --> 02:09.398
uh, my 4-H club leader, uh, county assistant, a 
county, county agent. brought me down to A&M

02:10.222 --> 02:22.139
several times for the 4-H club roundup, convinced 
me that I needed to go to A&M, and that's sort of how

02:10.222 --> 02:22.139
it all got started then. So you had been to visit. 
What impression did A&M make on you when you came to

02:26.425 --> 02:31.552
visit? Well, being from a rather small place, 
although A&M was not very big at the time, it seemed

02:31.572 --> 02:40.144
big to me, and I guess it had a reputation and an aura 
about it and its graduates and a loyalty that I saw

02:40.698 --> 03:10.249
in them and another thing that was in my family 
background was I'd had two uncles and two cousins

02:40.698 --> 03:10.249
come to A&M before I did none of them graduated none 
of them really got close to graduating so when I

02:40.698 --> 03:10.249
decided to come to A&M The ones of those people that 
were still living all said, you know, you're our

03:10.550 --> 03:19.179
last hope for ever, a graduate from A&M. So that was 
one of the things in my background. And there was no

03:24.845 --> 03:28.088
fish camp in those days, was there? No. Was there 
anything before enrolling? We came a week before

03:32.252 --> 03:35.475
the upperclassmen came. And we had our freshman 
orientation. I remember there were no parents

03:40.587 --> 04:06.932
stayed around for that you know I mean they all uh 
most of the parents didn't are we on most of the

03:40.587 --> 04:06.932
parents didn't even uh bring their children you 
know their sons they just they a lot of them

03:40.587 --> 04:06.932
hitchhiked here and road buses and train and 
everything and got here the best they could and and

04:07.587 --> 04:34.843
I remember when that week was over the 
upperclassmen that were our uh our company

04:07.587 --> 04:34.843
officers told us that the upperclassmen are 
coming in this weekend if you got any good judgment

04:07.587 --> 04:34.843
at all you'll get out of here and not come back until 
the very last minute on Sunday night so that was

04:07.587 --> 04:34.843
what we all did we all hadn't planned to leave but we 
were all pretty encouraged where did you go My

04:35.549 --> 04:43.259
roommate and I were both from Iowa Park and we 
hitchhiked home and hitchhiked back and got here

04:35.549 --> 04:43.259
in the middle of the night on Sunday night. Started 
our first year. Now when you came at the beginning

04:46.123 --> 04:52.993
of that week, how did you get down here? Did mom and 
dad bring you or a relative? His mother brought us.

04:56.938 --> 04:57.398
Okay. My mother was a school teacher and she'd 
already started to work I guess that so she

05:04.321 --> 05:08.725
couldn't get off. I guess my dad was not as 
impressed with this whole activity as she was. Did

05:15.551 --> 05:20.616
you get any advice from anybody, parents or 
anybody else, before you left? Did they tell you

05:21.516 --> 05:23.899
anything to do or not do? Do you remember? I can't 
remember that. I remember that my roommate's

05:29.804 --> 05:34.328
mother who was a widow, was a little, you know, 
emotional when she left us down here, but other

05:34.544 --> 05:47.435
than that, I don't remember really. It

05:48.496 --> 05:59.566
seems like one of my uncles told me that he expected 
me to, you know, represent the family well or

05:48.496 --> 05:59.566
something like that, and that was about it. Did, 
what did you think you were going to do in terms of

05:59.946 --> 06:04.230
major and long time future when you at that point at 
that point in my life that uncle that i just

06:04.582 --> 06:32.766
mentioned was one of the dominant male figures and 
he was a successful rancher and i kind of

06:04.582 --> 06:32.766
envisioned myself as becoming a junior partner 
and getting my mother had a part of the family

06:04.582 --> 06:32.766
estate and you know i sort of thought that i would 
move into the ranching business by that means and

06:33.151 --> 07:02.601
but other than that the other thing that was in my 
head was could I make it you know could I go to what by

06:33.151 --> 07:02.601
our standards was a major college and graduate so 
being from a small high school not having much how

06:33.151 --> 07:02.601
many in senior class about 42 42

07:02.868 --> 07:10.798
And I presume you were like I, that you had not 
traveled much around the region. Well, not in

07:11.980 --> 07:14.623
academic circles at all. My father's father lived 
in California when I was in high school, when I was

07:15.564 --> 07:24.796
in school, grade school and high school. And we'd 
gone out there a couple of times. So that was my

07:27.500 --> 07:30.664
extent of traveling was two or three trips to 
California. Do you remember what you brought with

07:34.915 --> 07:38.100
you when you came to enroll? What, how much stuff?

07:42.087 --> 07:50.661
I guess I had a small suitcase and a

07:42.087 --> 07:50.661
foot locker, and I remember I had a radio and

07:51.772 --> 08:17.492
maybe one change of civilian clothes they told us 
to take not bring anything else that we couldn't

07:51.772 --> 08:17.492
wear it anyway and so Now this was the fall of 19 51 51 
and when your

07:51.772 --> 08:17.492
when your roommate's mother drove away Y'all were 
then in the hands of what, seniors or sophomores?

08:23.954 --> 08:24.997
Juniors and seniors. Juniors and seniors. This 
was a time that the Corps had just come back maybe a

08:25.958 --> 08:36.038
year or two before, maybe just that year, from 
Bryan Air Force Base. And so we were still in

08:36.473 --> 08:45.205
outfits that had cadre of upperclassmen and then 
we were all freshmen. And there were no sophomores

08:45.566 --> 08:57.803
in those units until either after Christmas or 
sometime in the middle of the spring semester we

08:45.566 --> 08:57.803
finally got two or three sophomores. Do you have 
any idea how you got assigned to your outfit? What

09:01.949 --> 09:02.910
was it? What was that outfit like? I can't remember 
for sure. I think we had some choice of which unit

09:09.099 --> 09:15.766
that we would be in. And I don't, it seems to me like 
that that county agent whose name was Bill

09:16.566 --> 09:32.923
Pallmeyer and who called me just a few days ago, 
he's still alive, still, you know, interested in

09:16.566 --> 09:32.923
my wife and I. By the way, she was in the 4-H club, 
too, so he knew her and I both. I think he was in the

09:39.005 --> 09:44.733
Transportation Corps, so I think I may have chosen 
that because of him. Now, what outfit was it? Well,

09:46.856 --> 09:49.480
it was just A Transportation Corps. I don't think 
the unit exists anymore. So it didn't have a letter

09:51.803 --> 09:56.189
or a G-1 or H-5? No, it was A. Then... in a battalion 
it was Company A and there was B, C, and D but they

10:01.574 --> 10:18.138
were not the Transportation Corps they were other 
well I guess there was at the my freshman year there

10:01.574 --> 10:18.138
may have been two well I'm not sure I don't know. And 
you were assigned to dorm space where?

10:26.109 --> 10:29.995
The dorm right across the street from the uh, 
exchange store, the, uh, uh, beside, uh, G.F.

10:30.481 --> 10:37.471
Gondblank. That's not, that's not the Zell, is it? 
No, no, it was over by the, uh, Sabisa. Yeah, yeah.

10:44.160 --> 10:48.706
Uh, I, what was the name of that? We'll think about 
that later. I've forgotten that. Uh, describe how

10:50.989 --> 10:57.838
the upperclassmen whipped you fish into shape. 
How did they get y'all began to break you in and

10:59.692 --> 11:05.019
orient you? Well, they, the people that were our 
officers in our units were pretty benevolent,

11:05.039 --> 11:19.256
kind-hearted types. They picked them, I think, 
for that. They were trying to prepare us to learn

11:24.008 --> 11:49.392
everything that we needed to learn and to adopt the 
sort of mind state that we had to go through this so

11:24.008 --> 11:49.392
this was sort of the way I guess the way we viewed it 
was that we were sort of running a long gauntlet

11:24.008 --> 11:49.392
that was going to be a year long you know and we were 
going to be beset by all sorts of challenges from

11:24.008 --> 11:49.392
every direction and we were sort of preparing 
ourselves to survive. But I remember the first

11:55.625 --> 12:03.316
week we were here, we were marching everywhere we 
would go for some sort of an orientation meeting or

11:55.625 --> 12:03.316
something. We were marching. They marched us down 
Military Walk from in front of Sevesa there, and we

12:04.217 --> 12:18.417
went by Walton Hall, which was the dorm that the 
athletes were in in those days. And I guess we were

12:18.937 --> 12:23.303
going to Gine Hall for some kind of a meeting. And so 
all these very irreverent athletes were hanging

12:23.323 --> 12:31.214
out the windows there on Walton. Was it Walton? 
Anyway, they were yelling at us, you know, your

12:33.257 --> 12:46.075
mommies are, you know, you go home to mommies, you 
know, and you'll never, None of you will be here in

12:46.578 --> 12:48.661
six weeks. And look around. Everybody that you can 
see will have quit before Christmas and

12:50.903 --> 12:55.569
everything. And unfortunately, a lot of what they 
were saying was true. There was a big dropout

12:59.774 --> 13:04.179
during the first year that I was here. And during 
those first few days, was there much hazing and so

13:05.521 --> 13:15.653
forth that went on? No, not really. I don't 
remember. They taught us how to whip out or

13:20.153 --> 13:32.792
introduce ourselves and things like that, and 
they said, now I'm going to imitate what a

13:20.153 --> 13:32.792
sophomore is going to do to you, you know, and that 
sort of thing. It was not, I don't remember that as

13:32.952 --> 13:42.767
being particularly terrifying, but the first 
sophomore I met, I remember that was particularly

13:32.952 --> 13:42.767
terrifying. Describe that. Well, you know, we 
were, it could have been that first Sunday night or

13:44.763 --> 14:12.897
maybe the first Monday night after school started 
and we had to go someplace and come back and we were

13:44.763 --> 14:12.897
stopped out in front of the dorm and stood out there 
at attention for what seemed like a year, probably

13:44.763 --> 14:12.897
was 15 minutes, you know, and people walking 
around us describing how poorly we were dressed

14:13.771 --> 14:20.665
and how our shoeshines were inadequate and 
everything, you know. Now, did you go through

14:20.685 --> 14:23.771
academic registration? They had registration in 
those days, but there was, this was just after the

14:25.635 --> 14:34.092
Korean War had started. And so my class was a 
record-sized class. I'm sure there were a lot of

14:38.910 --> 14:44.977
people who decided to go to A&M that were hoping to 
stay out of the war. And so when we went through

14:45.939 --> 14:53.809
registration, it was at the end of that week of 
orientation. It was before the upperclassmen had

14:53.869 --> 14:56.753
gotten back. And they had pre-assigned us, 
depending on which major we chose, and I guess in my

15:03.029 --> 15:32.968
case it had to do with whether or not I'd had 
trigonometry

15:03.029 --> 15:32.968
and plane geometry and chemistry those were the 
three deciding courses I believe and since I had

15:03.029 --> 15:32.968
well they put us all of the people that were 
majoring in wildlife science and range

15:03.029 --> 15:32.968
management and a couple of other majors all in the 
same block of sections so we just got a you know an

15:03.029 --> 15:32.968
assignment of came straight out of the catalog Do 
you remember what your major title was then? Were

15:37.474 --> 15:41.620
you, was it just agriculture or was it more 
specific for you? Well, during that week of

15:42.841 --> 15:55.317
orientation, I was wavering back and forth 
between some sort of engineering and something to

15:42.841 --> 15:55.317
do with agriculture. And I finally decided to 
major in, range management because of the family

15:58.818 --> 16:27.238
connection to the ranching industry so I actually 
chose range management as a freshman and stayed

15:58.818 --> 16:27.238
with that all the way through my four years it was 
called ranging the department and the degree were

15:58.818 --> 16:27.238
called range and forestry and Stephen F. Austin 
had the only accredited forestry program in the

15:58.818 --> 16:27.238
state at the time and A&M wanted it I guess and so 
they had this degree called a range in forestry and

16:27.505 --> 16:40.558
I think we took maybe two forestry courses had one 
person that taught in that area. Do you have any

16:40.779 --> 16:44.468
idea what your academic load was that first 
semester? 15, 18 hours? No, it was 19 hours. 19?

16:51.222 --> 16:52.403
Uh-huh. And describe your impression, your first 
impression of those courses and the instructors.

17:00.711 --> 17:15.484
Well, I guess I was

17:00.711 --> 17:15.484
very concerned to start out with that, you know, 
everything was going to be extremely difficult

17:00.711 --> 17:15.484
and and I did have a hard time with English I 
remember I didn't do particularly well in English

17:16.055 --> 17:43.885
but right off the bat I began to take quizzes and do 
fairly well and I found out that a lot of people

17:16.055 --> 17:43.885
around me in my outfit and others that were in that 
section were not doing so well and so I began to

17:16.055 --> 17:43.885
realize that you know that that not only could I 
survive but I could actually do you know above

17:44.303 --> 18:13.770
average academically and that was a great relief 
to me you know when the first grades came out and I

17:44.303 --> 18:13.770
well they had exemptions in those days so I was 
exempted from all of my finals I think except one or

17:44.303 --> 18:13.770
something like that and then I made you know a 
distinguished student uh GPA at the end of that

18:14.476 --> 18:16.720
semester. So that began to kind of build up my 
confidence. Did you have some instructors and or

18:20.847 --> 18:34.712
courses that first semester that you now realize 
were significant to you later in the impression

18:20.847 --> 18:34.712
they made on you?

18:35.350 --> 19:04.210
I've thought about that some since I scheduled to 
do this and I'm not sure now whether they were the

18:35.350 --> 19:04.210
first semester or the second semester but I had a 
biology course with

18:35.350 --> 19:04.210
Mr. Dobson who or Dr. Dobson and he made a really 
good impression on me and I remember one time he

19:05.033 --> 19:33.775
asked me after must have been the second semester 
because he asked me what my GPA was and I was

19:05.033 --> 19:33.775
apparently a little having a little ego problem at 
the time you know so I told him and I know that I was

19:05.033 --> 19:33.775
feeling really proud and he said oh Paige you can do 
better than that so Then, you know, that made me

19:34.227 --> 19:39.454
think, well, you know he's right. I could do better 
than that. So he was one of the people that had

19:42.258 --> 19:49.668
students over for dinner occasionally. And that 
was a big milestone in my life, you know, was to

19:50.369 --> 19:56.117
actually visit with the professor on a social 
level rather than just to see him in the classroom,

19:56.502 --> 20:06.856
to meet his family, to meet his kids and 
everything. That made a big impression on me. And,

20:10.220 --> 20:15.367
uh, were there, what about English or math or 
science? Well, uh, the, uh, I don't I remember some

20:24.380 --> 20:50.185
of the English professors I've looked back at the 
math I can't identify who I had as a math instructor

20:24.380 --> 20:50.185
but I had Mr. Hedgecock and Greer and Shepherd I 
remember in English and all of them were probably

20:24.380 --> 20:50.185
pretty tolerant of semi-literate West Texas kids 
you know and I probably learned a lot about writing

20:51.008 --> 21:18.754
in those under those people even though I didn't 
you know make I can't remember I must have made a B in

20:51.008 --> 21:18.754
one under one of them but anyway I remember them I 
remember Victor Whining was in the English

20:51.008 --> 21:18.754
department And I had been a debater in high school. 
And so I got on the debate team here at A&M and did

21:22.098 --> 21:26.986
that for a couple of years. And that was a real 
enlightening experience. And all of those

21:30.872 --> 21:33.997
faculty members were full-time faculty. No such 
thing then as what we today call TAs. No. No, they

21:39.365 --> 21:40.126
were all. And about how large were the sections in 
number of students? Any big ones? Chemistry was

21:46.392 --> 21:48.094
really big. I remember that. Like over a hundred, I 
guess. It was in the big lecture room in the

21:53.401 --> 21:57.646
chemistry building. I don't remember any other 
big sections. 40 or 50 students was probably the

22:02.953 --> 22:06.717
largest of anything. And did you feel that the 
faculty members were accessible if you wanted to

22:06.898 --> 22:11.944
talk to them? Well, I guess I did, but I didn't 
really ever do that very much.

22:24.952 --> 22:33.165
Some of the faculty, I remember one of the English 
professors insisted that we make appointments

22:24.952 --> 22:33.165
and come by and talk to him. And that was good for a 
young kid from a small town.

22:42.640 --> 22:50.993
But the faculty didn't act aloof or distant or 
anything like that. you know they all seem to be

22:51.597 --> 23:18.583
very human approachable people uh the in in terms 
of academics then you didn't come close to

22:51.597 --> 23:18.583
flunking anything you were doing well did you feel 
begin to feel that your high school had prepared

22:51.597 --> 23:18.583
you pretty well yes i did and i remember one time 
thinking that oh i i after a year or so I was invited

23:19.542 --> 23:49.077
to speak to a assembly

23:19.542 --> 23:49.077
back at my high school and I remember encouraging 
the kids to you know to take the hard courses in high

23:19.542 --> 23:49.077
school don't wait until you go to college to take 
trig and calculus or chemistry or biology or you

23:19.542 --> 23:49.077
know and and I remember that that I had the 
impression that I didn't really communicate that

23:49.546 --> 23:55.680
very well. Most of the kids weren't as serious 
about it as they should have been. Now, meanwhile,

24:01.122 --> 24:09.293
describe what life was like in the dormitory, and 
what was a typical class day? What time did y'all

24:09.333 --> 24:10.675
get up? What happened when? Begin at daylight and 
take me through 10, 30, 11 o'clock at night on

24:12.798 --> 24:19.507
typical class day. Well, I'm not sure about actual 
times, but it, I imagine that we got up about 6 30,

24:21.270 --> 24:30.302
and we had about 15 minutes from the time we got up 
until we were due in formation. out in front of the

24:36.847 --> 25:05.065
dorm, and we would march into Sabisa and eat 
breakfast, and then we had a little time before

24:36.847 --> 25:05.065
classes, the first class of the day, and since we 
were carrying 18 or 19 hours, all of us, well, we had

24:36.847 --> 25:05.065
a, and in my section, everybody had two or three 
laps, so We were busy most of the day going to

25:05.450 --> 25:16.124
classes and you came back to the dorm and you had a 
formation for lunch. You marched into the

25:16.165 --> 25:32.807
building for lunch and of course we all sat 
together as a unit and there was assigned

25:16.165 --> 25:32.807
upperclassmen on each table and we learned to give 
meal service to the upperclassmen and not eat

25:16.165 --> 25:32.807
until we served them and uh everything and um one 
thing that that you know that was interesting was

25:33.260 --> 26:01.123
we had a number of waiters in our unit and those were 
special guys you know they were they were the

25:33.260 --> 26:01.123
poorest of the poor I guess you know they were 
working their way through A&M and and so they would

25:33.260 --> 26:01.123
had to get up earlier than we did and everything but 
I remember a lot of those guys were really

26:01.677 --> 26:04.943
hard-working, serious kids, you know. Did they 
also kind of help your outfit, maybe get a little

26:04.983 --> 26:09.532
extra serving every now and then? The freshmen 
were all encouraged to stay in the dining hall

26:10.374 --> 26:24.681
until they had eaten as much as they wanted, you 
know, so the last people to leave every meal were

26:10.374 --> 26:24.681
always the freshmen. and our waiter friends would 
be sure that there was plenty of stuff left on our

26:25.268 --> 26:32.120
table when the upperclassmen left. Now how did you 
and your buddies learn all of the vocabulary for

26:33.182 --> 26:41.556
the food and everything? the nicknames, were you 
taught that? We were taught that mostly during

26:45.140 --> 27:09.923
that week of orientation and it's amazing how fast 
you can learn if you're under the threat you know

26:45.140 --> 27:09.923
nothing bad ever really happened to anyone but it 
just seemed like if somebody was yelling at you you

26:45.140 --> 27:09.923
could learn faster than if you just could either do 
it or not do it Did you have enough time to actually

27:10.426 --> 27:13.010
to eat? Yes, yes. Mainly because there were only 
one or two upperclassmen per table. And it was, you

27:20.460 --> 27:27.049
know, at the time, I guess it seemed fairly 
traumatic. But looking back on it, it was fairly

27:27.910 --> 27:36.282
amusing, you know, to some of the things that 
happened and everything. It wasn't that bad. Were

27:38.708 --> 27:41.591
there any foods that you remember that were new to 
you?

27:46.197 --> 28:07.602
They had combinations of things uh well I guess I 
had never eaten uh

27:46.197 --> 28:07.602
trying to remember they they had tamales they had a 
Mexican meal that had tamales in it and beans and

27:46.197 --> 28:07.602
rice and I've forgotten what else you know I don't 
think I'd ever had many tamales in my whole life you

28:07.919 --> 28:24.346
know maybe at least that wasn't a major thing that 
we ate and uh they had cream puffs but the freshmen

28:07.919 --> 28:24.346
rarely ever got to eat cream puffs so. Were there 
kush questions in your outfit? Yes. Do you

28:27.872 --> 28:30.957
remember some of your pet kush questions? Well 
there were certain kinds of cush questions for

28:31.358 --> 28:38.228
which there was no acceptable correct answer Such 
as? How many tiles are there in the bottom of the

28:38.248 --> 28:57.636
swimming pool and even if you went over and counted 
them you were not going to win that cush question

28:38.248 --> 28:57.636
you know you were gonna that was the kind of 
question they asked when the upperclassmen

28:38.248 --> 28:57.636
wanted your dessert so that but that was okay Was 
there any, say on desserts, was there any dessert

28:57.953 --> 29:04.145
that was kind of everybody's favorite that y'all 
really looked forward to? Well, I think cream

29:04.205 --> 29:13.624
puffs fit into that category because the 
upperclassmen always ask difficult questions.

29:13.844 --> 29:16.890
When they had cream puffs and the freshmen, I don't 
know whether we really liked them or not. It was

29:19.336 --> 29:24.584
just that we thought that they were good because we 
couldn't get one. And what were the least favorite

29:25.145 --> 29:28.069
foods?

29:31.133 --> 29:33.457
Or were there any? Well, I remember they served 
stewed tomatoes with bread, and there were

29:33.477 --> 29:43.992
usually a lot of that left.

29:45.271 --> 29:49.656
I can't, I can't remember what else. Now when you 
went home, either Thanksgiving, Christmas, or

29:49.676 --> 30:02.150
Easter, did you, like I've heard a few others, 
forget and use some of the Aggie lingo at the table

29:49.676 --> 30:02.150
at home and almost get in trouble?

30:06.675 --> 30:14.164
I, I don't remember doing that, but I remember 
that, you know, people talking about doing it, and

30:06.675 --> 30:14.164
some of the Some of the nomenclature was pretty 
crude, and I could visualize getting in trouble if

30:14.768 --> 30:25.204
you used some of that. Now, as your routine of study 
began to take shape, if you had any free time during

30:25.845 --> 30:42.029
the day, where did you go to spend that time, 
whether to study or to just relax? Where did you go?

30:45.953 --> 31:02.131
Well, I mostly went back to my room because we 
didn't have many upperclassmen in our dorm and uh,

30:45.953 --> 31:02.131
uh, the, the dorm was not a, you know, not a 
stressful place to be during the day. And uh, I

31:03.272 --> 31:14.965
don't remember hanging out at, well, one thing 
about it was that if you were in your dorm, our dorms

31:03.272 --> 31:14.965
were off limits to sophomores and that was one of 
the, few places on campus that you couldn't become

31:15.755 --> 31:24.077
the source of amusement for two.
