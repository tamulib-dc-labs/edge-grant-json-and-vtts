WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:17.864
the background here at A&M, that coming here from 
Ithaca right away to teach, I had to give up my, what

00:02.461 --> 00:17.864
I had begun on our Long Island as a soil surveyor, 
which Dr. Lyon said I really needed. And Dr. W.T.

00:21.650 --> 00:28.300
Carter, who was the soil, held the position of the 
division of soil survey for the state of Texas and

00:28.668 --> 00:42.206
produced the first fine soil map of Texas and the 
discussion and description of the soil types and

00:28.668 --> 00:42.206
soil series of Texas. He took me in hand and not only 
took me but my graduate students and me into the

00:43.047 --> 00:56.025
major soil divisions of Texas and supervise and 
super and conducted our our investigation of the

00:56.748 --> 01:23.785
Maine soil regions and how to make, which was then 
very well-recognized in 19 and 26, the soil

00:56.748 --> 01:23.785
profile, 27 and right on up through 1934 when we had 
a soil...

00:56.748 --> 01:23.785
We had the soil...

01:25.537 --> 01:35.066
Science in the federal branch in 1935 changed to 
soil conservation service.

01:35.086 --> 01:40.631
Soil erosion service for one year and then changed 
to soil service, soil conservation. And I took at

01:41.551 --> 01:54.463
the cooperation and suggestion of Dean Kyle and 
and

01:41.551 --> 01:54.463
Garb and Merrill, Lewis P. Merrill, was able to 
spend the summer of 1934 in the Soil Conservation

01:55.355 --> 02:11.114
Service near Tyler in Smith County.

02:18.563 --> 02:21.447
In the summer of 1934.

02:24.110 --> 02:29.518
Depression was being felt pretty strongly at A&M. 
And most teachers took a cut of around 30%. And

02:36.307 --> 02:46.001
our first child, our second child was born that 
year. And due to family background, I took my wife

02:46.942 --> 02:52.750
to Temple to give birth to the child at Scott and 
White Hospital in Grover, but her college station

02:53.354 --> 03:05.332
twice a week to help Dr. J.O. Morgan on the 
laboratory. Dr. Morgan was then beginning to feel

03:08.357 --> 03:17.711
the result of his night and day work when he worked 
on his PhD at Cornell. He got tooth trouble and he

03:18.272 --> 03:21.657
died later in 33. And then a job was offered at 
Prairie View, teaching soils there, which I was

03:22.598 --> 03:31.846
very glad to have in that summer of 1930. When I came 
back, Fred Hale, who was a

03:33.488 --> 03:51.424
meat cutting man, an animal husbandry expert, 
looked at my hand and said, well, Lucy, you haven't

03:33.488 --> 03:51.424
turned black yet.

03:51.792 --> 04:02.602
When you were on the faculty, say from 27 on, did you 
live on campus, in campus housing? Yes. We, 26 to

04:04.924 --> 04:20.719
27, we rented one of the new houses from Dr. Weasley 
Clark's

04:04.924 --> 04:20.719
College Station Development Association south 
of the campus. In the fall of 27, Thomas F. Mayo,

04:21.037 --> 04:35.478
librarian, encouraged my wife and me to sublet his 
house on the campus next to the hospital. In the

04:36.800 --> 04:50.740
fall of 28, the

04:36.800 --> 04:50.740
faculty committee on housing awarded us rental of 
a house behind what was then The Steel Stadium next

04:51.479 --> 04:56.947
to Professor Ness.

05:01.634 --> 05:04.278
Had some valuable association in those years. Was 
the Steel Stadium located in the same place as the

05:04.578 --> 05:08.183
current Kyle Field? Yes. When it was dismantled in 
the summer of 29, then they moved our house down to a

05:10.667 --> 05:19.680
place right looking upon the beginning of the 
100-yard dash. What was in the 100-yard dash

05:28.013 --> 05:30.216
straight away. What type of house were you in? 
Frame house, which had previously been part of the

05:35.303 --> 05:39.469
old hospital.

05:42.113 --> 05:48.081
The other half was the one that had been used on the 
campus by Dr. Mayo.

05:51.419 --> 05:58.028
Did you continue to live on campus through all of 
your teaching career, or at what point did you move

05:51.419 --> 05:58.028
off? We lived on campus until the rule came up in 
1941 that

05:58.509 --> 06:15.672
nobody, be he dean or be he an instructor, should 
continue to live on the campus in a campus house.

06:19.478 --> 06:21.240
We built a house then. present location in a 
five-acre tract, later a 26-acre tract, which we

06:21.473 --> 06:33.969
developed. Was that 41 or 51? 41. But there were 
still houses on the campus for a good long while,

06:36.492 --> 06:44.002
actually. For certain groups, such as the 
electrician and the librarian

06:52.726 --> 06:57.411
the sewer, such as required night. They were 
primarily staff instead of faculty. Yes, sir. Was

07:03.737 --> 07:10.504
there a considerable amount of socializing among 
the families who lived in those houses? Quite so.

07:14.408 --> 07:20.775
But due to A&M, even then, was one of the most 
pleasant places that I had ever been. In fact, when

07:24.572 --> 07:41.352
I got out of the Army and came down and rented a room 
in the YMCA and looked out of the back room onto

07:24.572 --> 07:41.352
Military Walk and saw the students doing the 
setting up exercises at 7 a.m., decided that this

07:24.572 --> 07:41.352
was the place that I wanted to be in my future.

07:45.697 --> 07:49.761
And speaking of housing, I'm reminded of another 
question I meant to ask you earlier. While you were

07:53.948 --> 07:59.233
working on your master's at Texas A&M in, what, 
1919 and 1920 and 21. Where did you live at that

08:00.395 --> 08:01.636
point? In

08:02.937 --> 08:06.801
19...

08:13.468 --> 08:16.912
In 19...

08:17.112 --> 08:22.217
I'd gotten out of the Army until the fall of... 
1919, I lived in the old Shirley Hotel, which were

08:23.328 --> 08:36.766
two frame buildings and offered not only housing 
but good food. And the Shirley Hotel then was torn

08:38.168 --> 08:42.895
down later to make way for the Aggieland Inn. In the 
fall of 1919, in September, I was able to get into

08:44.357 --> 08:52.828
Milner Hall with W. William P. Derrick, who later 
became animal husbandry chief at Nebraska

08:53.011 --> 09:01.504
University, University of Nebraska. And I had to 
go from there to the second year in graduate work

09:01.524 --> 09:21.735
and lived in Gallegate Hall, where we found out 
what it was, what was meant by the entomological

09:01.524 --> 09:21.735
ability to make the dormitories entirely free. of 
anything that might molest a sleeper.

09:31.538 --> 09:39.171
Milner Hall was always a delightful dormitory to 
me. Were there all graduate students living in

09:39.331 --> 09:42.015
Milner Hall? No, it was mixed then. Mixed. What 
about when you moved to Leggett? Was it also mixed?

09:48.147 --> 10:06.335
Mostly undergraduates, but my roommate there was 
a graduate student too, who later went to Brazil to

09:48.147 --> 10:06.335
the Presbyterian Church to introduce agronomy, 
agronomic work in Brazil. Where did you have your

10:06.355 --> 10:07.457
meals? We were fortunate to be able to eat in Speza 
Hall. But I take it since you were not military, you

10:13.758 --> 10:26.133
did not have to march in with the... No sir, we ate in 
what was called the civilian, they didn't call

10:13.758 --> 10:26.133
them civilians, they called them another name. At 
one point they called them casuals. Casuals, yes.

10:30.878 --> 10:34.102
So you had a separate dining area within Sevesa for 
the... Yes,

10:34.122 --> 10:39.088
yes. Okay. I believe I picked up from a newspaper 
clipping in our files that you served a number of

10:41.129 --> 10:47.656
years on the College Station City Council. Yes, I 
was on the initial organization where we met in the

10:48.437 --> 11:06.917
chemistry building lecture room in, to the best of 
my recollection, in October 19, I know the year

10:48.437 --> 11:06.917
definitely, 1938. It was either spring or the fall 
of 1938 and resolved that we didn't have but one

11:08.095 --> 11:16.148
road to get to Bryan. And I had been pointed, had 
been pointed to committee to see if we could get

11:17.130 --> 11:28.469
what is now College Main Street graveled so we 
could get to Bryan easier. And the county

11:33.813 --> 11:37.738
And the judge said, where's the money coming from? 
And I said, from the county sources, or perhaps

11:37.798 --> 11:46.671
Brian can furnish a little to help get that trade 
into Brian. And this, you can put this in or not as

11:47.752 --> 11:51.838
you want. And said, we can't spend money on that. So 
we met, we got together and said we needed another

11:55.102 --> 11:59.989
grocery store. We had one Luke Patronell and 
Charlie Northgate and organized a video college

12:00.796 --> 12:29.942
station

12:00.796 --> 12:29.942
and without pay for anybody, John Henry Binney was 
the mayor and Wheeler Bargo was made the

12:00.796 --> 12:29.942
county, the city attorney

12:00.796 --> 12:29.942
and we gave Jack

12:31.137 --> 12:41.987
Boyd, the honorary distinction of being the 
deputy. And we each sparked up a little and got a

12:42.007 --> 12:49.974
deposit in the bank, I think, of $70. You mentioned 
that you only had one road. We had to go and follow

12:55.578 --> 13:00.823
the railroad track on what is now Old College Road. 
And that's the one you wanted to have graveled?

13:05.916 --> 13:11.883
We had a piece of...

13:11.903 --> 13:14.647
Yes, we wanted that road graveled. Because what is 
now College of Maine didn't extend beyond the...

13:14.667 --> 13:30.827
what is now the...

13:14.667 --> 13:30.827
complex of apartment houses. Okay. About 200 
yards. Uh-huh. That is the four-lane portion of

13:37.335 --> 13:43.642
College Main that runs between Skag Albertson's 
and the Collegeville apartments. Didn't exist.

13:44.703 --> 13:45.704
That didn't exist. That came into existence under 
Chancellor Gilchrist. And I remember that

13:51.510 --> 14:00.679
distinctly because I was on advisory committee 
and

13:51.510 --> 14:00.679
the the ones the county wanted to build the road to 
directly enter Abazel, what do you know, Abazel

14:01.874 --> 14:11.564
Street. And Mr. Giltrist stated that that might 
not fit too well into the campus plans that were

14:12.385 --> 14:24.237
already made. And it was opened up then.

14:30.848 --> 14:36.016
into the present location.

14:36.036 --> 14:37.779
It almost coincides.

14:43.388 --> 14:45.071
Did, you indicated that... I was also on the school 
board for the Consolidated School in, I think in

14:45.091 --> 14:56.890
the year 19 and

14:59.485 --> 15:01.647
in 1939, D.B. Cofer and Mitchell. John Mitchell 
decided that we needed to transfer to have a school

15:07.793 --> 15:23.809
outside of the A&M campus, which was meeting then 
in old Pfeiffer Hall and that wooden building

15:07.793 --> 15:23.809
adjacent.

15:24.910 --> 15:27.433
And he made the rounds from different people to try 
to get enough to buy a little piece of land where we

15:28.426 --> 15:32.492
could have a school. And at that time, among other 
activities, I was one of the competitors for the

15:33.574 --> 15:46.473
open handball competition we held, so-called 
championship. And Mr. Colfer and Mr. Mitchell

15:47.514 --> 15:56.307
walked all the way down to the old handball courts, 
which were in that wooden building. and asked me if

15:57.299 --> 16:02.166
I'd contribute to buying that old piece of ground. 
And I think I gave him what was the end of, what we

16:02.948 --> 16:11.461
thought was the end of the Depression, $200. And 
Mr. Cashin then headed, that was treasurer, and

16:11.561 --> 16:26.243
went over and bought that piece of land from the, 
uh, um, Dowborough Valleys and the, uh, that's

16:28.062 --> 16:50.880
where the current where the original school is now 
what's um or it's still what the three-story where

16:28.062 --> 16:50.880
the three-story brick building is that faces 
jersey street yes sir it's not it's not

16:28.062 --> 16:50.880
three-story though is it two two well it does well 
to be a good one and a half uh-huh Well, it was the

16:51.485 --> 16:53.948
middle school a couple years ago. Now the middle 
school's moved across the street where the high

16:53.988 --> 16:58.514
school used to be by the football stadium there. 
Well, that's where our first teaching place was.

17:03.740 --> 17:04.201
Now, where? You mean where the... The so-called 
hunk of land going out Bissell Street, isn't it,

17:06.183 --> 17:11.690
into Jersey? You come right into what was the first 
piece of land for the school. Mm-hmm. And various

17:20.105 --> 17:28.557
citizens were allowed to volunteer to put in the 
pavement of the sidewalks, which Dr. A. A. Dunlap

17:28.577 --> 17:34.066
and I did a lot of work in, and the getting of a Yopon 
and other shrubs. There was a whole lot of

17:36.068 --> 17:40.235
community feeling in those days. But at that point 
I would say probably everybody whose children

17:46.514 --> 17:51.480
went to that school was either a faculty or staff 
member at Texas A&M? I believe it was, yes. There

17:53.383 --> 17:57.207
were many of the, that's right, faculty or staff 
members, yes. That's a good way to put it. There

17:59.671 --> 18:11.485
were some folks from the dairy, there were certain 
dairy families, dairy production, milk

17:59.671 --> 18:11.485
production families, their children went to 
Consolidated.

18:11.966 --> 18:12.707
You mentioned something about either getting the 
road paved to Bryan or else having to have another

18:13.227 --> 18:18.712
grocery store. Did you get that other grocery 
store? We wound up having a grocery store on... We

18:21.695 --> 18:27.200
didn't wind up. We had already inveigled the 
faculty, I mean the management,

18:27.220 --> 18:40.872
the Department of Physical Plants, what's now 
Physical Plants. I put in a store right next to

18:41.881 --> 18:53.262
Milner Hall and they did a big business and it was 
very convenient and helpful. Then the other

18:53.964 --> 19:03.822
grocery store that we were talking about was at 
South Gate and resulted from that incorporation

18:53.964 --> 19:03.822
as a incorporated municipality.

19:09.106 --> 19:15.434
The store that was on the campus, how long was that 
in existence?

19:15.454 --> 19:19.440
About 10 years, if I can remember correctly. Did 
that start in 38 or 39? It was in the 30s. In the 30s

19:24.486 --> 19:25.868
that it started. So it carried what, a general line 
of groceries it would be? Yes, and bought from

19:30.474 --> 19:34.399
wholesale from what was then the Howell Wholesale 
Grocery. But it was, I would think that would have

19:41.454 --> 19:49.005
been kind of a unique situation where the 
university or the college would run its own. Well,

19:49.786 --> 19:57.357
the college really didn't have only an indirect 
control over it in the least, but it put in for the

19:49.786 --> 19:57.357
help of the faculty. And I was one of, with Pete 
Butler and Burgess and

20:06.560 --> 20:10.486
I missed the printer. We needed also a place where 
men could cash checks at odd hours, which were then

20:11.508 --> 20:27.094
odd hours, and we put in, for that purpose, 
organized a little state bank in 1946. Where was it

20:28.897 --> 20:30.559
located? It was located in a wooden shack behind 
where Homer Adams held his insurance store. What

20:37.060 --> 20:39.043
became of that bank? It is now the University 
National Bank. It became the University

20:40.505 --> 20:44.531
National.

20:44.551 --> 20:47.475
We had on the campus with Dr. I.P. Trotter as 
president, and I think it resulted in an assistant

20:47.495 --> 21:03.297
to the clerk, and we had the faculty loan and 
discount organizations on the campus. And when we

21:10.020 --> 21:32.972
got together and organized that bank, we allowed 
the bank to buy up that little

21:10.020 --> 21:32.972
faculty loan association.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.414
Get a mental block now and then. Uh-huh.

21:38.829 --> 21:40.333
I can remember that Dr. I.P. Trotter and I, as his 
assistant, had to close it out, and

21:40.353 --> 21:52.622
Mrs. Bower was also one of the last to give up. That 
was for your loan associate, faculty loan

21:56.996 --> 21:59.900
association. But you sold that out to the 
University National Bank. Yes. Was that always

22:03.624 --> 22:05.886
its name or did it have a... It started out as the 
College Station State Bank, 1946. And

22:10.612 --> 22:22.305
we had a, which you may not want, we had a up and down

22:23.112 --> 22:28.838
kaleidoscopic career for the first five years, 
which you might have heard of. No, I hadn't heard

22:30.040 --> 22:31.401
it. Well, after about three years,

22:31.421 --> 22:52.765
we had an executive vice president, which I won't 
name, who decided to make a loan of $40,000

22:31.421 --> 22:52.765
to a man who was didn't have too good a record to buy 
pipe. And to close the Second World War, about

22:58.267 --> 23:10.325
1948-9, pipe was to be bought from a man in Dallas 
who didn't really possess the pipe. And the money,

23:11.807 --> 23:22.363
instead of being put in, and I'll put this in 
writing, instead of being handled in telegraph,

23:23.002 --> 23:33.598
was handled by telephone by the executive

23:23.002 --> 23:33.598
vice president. And when it got to the big bank in 
Dallas, this man owed them more money than the

23:33.618 --> 23:42.872
amount a pipe cost, and their money was gone to 
seed. Another case of a big dog eating a little dog.

23:49.282 --> 23:51.625
We went to suit and got back half of it. and 
everybody out of $38 a share, I mean out of $26 a

23:52.769 --> 24:22.202
share, counting the stock and the reserve, 
everybody put up $12 gladly and surprised all the

23:52.769 --> 24:22.202
state banking department in Austin by being we all 
our directors met over there in Austin on a

24:22.587 --> 24:44.005
Saturday including Dr. Pete Butler and Herschel 
Burgess and myself and

24:22.587 --> 24:44.005
had the money raised by Monday and now I have over 17 
million below the line. I take it you have

24:49.053 --> 24:54.281
continued your connection with the University 
National Bank then? Yes, my interest in it

24:54.682 --> 24:59.189
continues.

24:59.209 --> 25:03.195
I guess you'd call it a director. You're still on 
the board of directors of the bank? At the age of 80.

25:08.664 --> 25:10.266
But you were one of the founders of it? Yes, the 
first president of it. Because it couldn't get

25:14.090 --> 25:18.979
anybody else to take it. Back to a little bit to your 
service on the city council in the city of College

25:18.999 --> 25:24.650
Station. I believe that was for, I believe I picked 
up seven years, which would have begun in 1938 or

25:25.091 --> 25:31.744
39. those must have been some pretty important 
years since that was when the city was actually

25:32.028 --> 25:40.000
incorporated or was created. You, I imagine, had 
to do a lot of planning, did you not? We did indeed

25:45.849 --> 26:00.432
and we had to be very careful of promises and when 
big arguments took place between dwellers

25:45.849 --> 26:00.432
on one of the best streets, such as Lee Street, and 
the dwellers on,

26:01.002 --> 26:11.856
what's the name of the general? First big general. 
Pershing? Pershing Street, on whether the alley

26:16.161 --> 26:30.199
should preserve its trees or should have trees cut 
so as to permit the entrance and exit of the garbage

26:16.161 --> 26:30.199
pickup truck the council had some very grave 
problems to handle. Sometimes members of the

26:37.425 --> 26:59.528
council would go out and and help open up certain 
areas and some of the busiest times was when the

26:37.425 --> 26:59.528
council almost overlapped with the school board 
and you had to try to get room for gravel and for

27:00.672 --> 27:13.752
pavement, for sidewalks at least, and for housing 
for some of the teachers in the school.

27:20.543 --> 27:26.612
Dr. Clark deserves credit for having started the 
first housing plan in College Station. And this is

27:31.159 --> 27:32.000
F.B. Clark? Yep, F.B. Clark. And it was very 
difficult in 1926 for a professor of poultry

27:34.562 --> 27:50.539
husbandry to get a loan locally to build a house, 
and he had to go to Houston Building and Loan to get

27:34.562 --> 27:50.539
his loan.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.924
But later that opened up very Well, indeed, 
because the teaching staff during the Depression

27:56.647 --> 28:07.598
had a type of person that paid every month on the 
doc. But it was hard money. And you got a faculty

28:11.983 --> 28:14.706
member that made $2,000. He thought he was riding 
high. Yeah, I can imagine, because there were a lot

28:18.369 --> 28:22.894
of people that weren't making anything. Yes. We 
weren't making anything. And one of the

28:26.955 --> 28:51.409
daughters, the daughters of one of our eminent men 
on the campus, one of the deans, married one of the

28:26.955 --> 28:51.409
most promising of our graduates here, who opened 
up a series of service stations in Memphis, which

28:26.955 --> 28:51.409
looked like one of the most productive jobs in the 
world. wound up having to service his own station,

28:52.148 --> 29:02.578
and she said that a person that had a job on the A&M 
faculty that gave him at least $1,800 really

28:52.148 --> 29:02.578
didn't know how lucky he was. She was the daughter 
of a dean.

29:11.446 --> 29:21.075
Those depression years produced a type of man that 
we wonder now what kind of individuals we have that

29:23.182 --> 29:32.794
can get on welfare and won't need to work. You can 
eliminate that, maybe. Well, I think you're not at

29:36.299 --> 29:40.384
all alone in making that comment. It's a fairly 
widely held belief and I think with some

29:41.466 --> 29:49.476
justification.

29:53.472 --> 29:57.337
doubt, though, that you would seriously advocate 
that we come back to the Depression era? We give

29:58.398 --> 30:07.749
welfare in the amount that is given and Social 
Security.

30:10.252 --> 30:14.357
We wouldn't come back to a place like we had in 1932.

30:17.080 --> 30:21.285
And we have friends who have read White, not Stuart 
Edward White, but the other White, who was the

30:21.856 --> 30:27.488
originator of Cornell University. Ezra Cornell 
got Dr. White to map out the foundation of Cornell

30:28.530 --> 30:38.852
in 1868, and he wrote a
