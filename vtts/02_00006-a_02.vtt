WEBVTT

00:01.955 --> 00:03.959
Sometimes about 35.

00:04.841 --> 00:09.811
Before that time, where did youngsters from the campus go to school?

00:10.111 --> 00:10.612
I don't know.

00:11.033 --> 00:13.418
I don't know.

00:13.438 --> 00:14.901
Probably went to prime.

00:15.235 --> 00:20.040
Did you ever hear any discussion about how it was financed?

00:20.060 --> 00:21.442
That I'm not familiar with.

00:21.482 --> 00:25.066
Because there wouldn't have been any school taxes on the campus folks.

00:25.286 --> 00:26.527
That's correct.

00:26.547 --> 00:40.703
Well, actually, there may have been in time, I know, because I think Dad was on the Equalization Board one time, and some people attempted not to pay taxes because they were on campus.

00:40.683 --> 00:45.852
But I think that eventually that they did, everyone paid taxes on and off campus.

00:45.872 --> 00:53.344
When you're beginning your first grade, how many, was it grades 1 through 11 all on campus?

00:53.785 --> 00:54.406
That's correct.

00:54.786 --> 00:56.970
Now the,

00:56.950 --> 01:10.073
Grade school and elementary levels were in the music hall, and the high school was in Pfeiffer Hall, which was the oldest building on campus when I was a student.

01:10.093 --> 01:21.793
It was built in 1887, and I actually had, not as a high school student, but as a college student, courses in that building, physiology and some pre-med courses.

01:21.773 --> 01:35.507
The teachers, the faculty of the elementary and high school, were any of those university faculty members, or were they all full-time teachers?

01:36.208 --> 01:38.150
Well, they were full-time teachers.

01:39.972 --> 01:45.958
Now, many of these teachers were the wives of professors.

01:45.938 --> 02:00.656
And some of the teachers eventually moved on up to NM, particularly during World War II when there was a faculty shortage at NM.

02:02.778 --> 02:08.004
We had good teachers and kind, considerate people, too.

02:08.545 --> 02:11.068
Describe some that you remember most warmly.

02:11.048 --> 02:14.814
Well, Mrs. Salmon was a very warm person.

02:14.834 --> 02:16.597
And, of course, she was my first grade teacher.

02:16.617 --> 02:19.060
And Mrs. Simms was my second grade teacher.

02:19.101 --> 02:22.826
She was a quieter person who was very comfortable to be around.

02:24.188 --> 02:34.845
And I recall one of the highlights of my second grade year was when Dr. Mangelsdorf brought... He was a...

02:34.825 --> 02:46.735
a plant physiologist, I presume, had a PhD, who later went to Yale as a member of their faculty.

02:47.896 --> 02:51.799
But he brought in many, many cuttings of various things.

02:51.919 --> 02:57.344
It was very interesting to see the flowers and the leaves and so forth.

02:57.384 --> 03:00.226
It was one of those memorable things you remember.

03:01.608 --> 03:04.410
My third grade teacher was Mrs. Holzman.

03:05.842 --> 03:10.448
I think her brother-in-law was the controller at NM.

03:10.488 --> 03:12.751
She was a very warm, nice person.

03:15.815 --> 03:18.478
Both in the second and third grade, I had pneumonia.

03:18.959 --> 03:22.062
And in those years, you didn't go back to school the next day.

03:22.102 --> 03:25.707
I missed the last six weeks of school as a second grader.

03:25.687 --> 03:44.472
And all of three months as a third grader, and during that time Mrs. Brownlee, whose husband was on the faculty at Allen Academy, tutored me to keep me up with my class.

03:44.452 --> 03:47.536
And Mrs. Lomax was my fourth grade teacher.

03:47.556 --> 03:50.459
She was a more business-like teacher.

03:50.479 --> 03:51.721
Have I heard of her husband?

03:53.182 --> 03:53.623
I don't know.

03:54.584 --> 03:57.247
I know there was a Lomax at the University of Texas at one time.

03:58.068 --> 03:59.810
Was that John Lomax?

03:59.830 --> 04:00.230
I don't know.

04:00.250 --> 04:01.011
The folklorist?

04:01.972 --> 04:02.533
What's that?

04:02.553 --> 04:03.695
The folklorist?

04:03.715 --> 04:04.215
I don't know.

04:04.576 --> 04:09.261
Because he passed through here during that period.

04:09.241 --> 04:20.520
There was a Lomax on the faculty making tremendously important recordings of folk music.

04:20.540 --> 04:20.820
Yes.

04:21.842 --> 04:26.189
Well, I presume it may have been, because she would have been probably in her 30s at that time.

04:26.249 --> 04:33.882
She was a stricter teacher than the other three.

04:34.013 --> 04:38.037
Give some examples of strict discipline during that time.

04:38.057 --> 04:39.278
What were you all not allowed to do?

04:39.719 --> 04:51.270
Well, I wouldn't say so much that, but she didn't tolerate unruliness in class, let's put it that way.

04:51.290 --> 05:01.000
And I don't think anybody got a spanking or anything, but I think that she verbally handled it in a way that kept us in mind.

05:01.486 --> 05:07.457
You and your buddies, what would have been examples of the kind of mischief you all might have attempted?

05:07.477 --> 05:15.593
You know, I guess it was just what little boys and girls do when they're that age.

05:15.633 --> 05:19.300
I don't remember anything specifically out of order.

05:19.340 --> 05:21.925
I can remember later that two of my

05:21.905 --> 05:26.830
male classmates who would never stop talking.

05:26.850 --> 05:32.956
I remember that, and I can recall one who later became a college professor getting a D in deportment.

05:32.976 --> 05:34.437
I will not mention his name.

05:35.478 --> 05:35.839
Let's see.

05:35.879 --> 05:41.244
Did y'all, either then or a little later, did you throw spit wads?

05:41.584 --> 05:45.248
Did you have rubber bands that you would shoot little?

05:45.268 --> 05:50.393
That was part of the process, yes.

05:50.373 --> 06:04.571
I think the most memorable event along the spitball line was when my brother and I were ill one time, and I guess recovering enough not to be just moribund.

06:05.853 --> 06:16.887
Mother and dad were at some social event one afternoon, and it was Sunday, and that was the one day a week that Ruby, our maid, was not there.

06:16.867 --> 06:32.378
And so we were allowed to supervise ourselves on this occasion, and we made little tubes of, maybe we had straws to drink our ginger ale with or something.

06:32.358 --> 06:37.447
And we were lying on our beds and we were shooting them up to the ceiling.

06:37.827 --> 06:44.238
And of course there was enough saliva in the spitball to leave a little halo around.

06:44.278 --> 06:48.826
The spitball might fall off after time, but the halo didn't.

06:49.507 --> 06:58.062
And so month and day had returned home to a ceiling with a great deal of modern art involved.

06:58.042 --> 07:05.152
And I remember that our illness did not prevent a little bit of reprimand physically at that point.

07:05.493 --> 07:09.779
Did y'all first attempt to deny any knowledge of how it came about?

07:10.801 --> 07:12.203
I think it was a little too obvious.

07:14.806 --> 07:15.187
Let's see.

07:15.668 --> 07:26.884
At school, did it matter among you and your friends, did it matter what the A&M College

07:28.214 --> 07:31.297
status was of your parents?

07:31.317 --> 07:37.424
The fact that so-and-so was the child of a dean or a full professor, did that matter?

07:37.444 --> 07:39.847
I don't think we were too aware of that.

07:40.808 --> 07:46.494
I do think this, that we tended to be a little bit tribal.

07:48.296 --> 07:52.520
And, for example, if you were from Bryan, you were Bryan Bratt.

07:53.482 --> 07:55.063
Oh, is that nickname used?

07:55.083 --> 07:56.685
Bryan Bratt, okay.

07:56.665 --> 08:03.655
And here I live in Bryan now, so I've had to make some adjustments throughout, you know, as an adult.

08:03.676 --> 08:20.040
But we really, it was a nice environment to live in, and we were, all of us were practically in the same grade for 11 years, and we knew each other, and I think we were rather tribal.

08:20.060 --> 08:24.006
And I'm assuming that one of the unacceptable

08:23.986 --> 08:32.770
bits of behavior would have been for somebody to have failed, but that would have... Yes.

08:32.790 --> 08:36.299
A youngster just wouldn't let that happen.

08:37.823 --> 08:39.227
That's right.

08:39.207 --> 08:42.950
You know, I was not too aware of that until a little later on.

08:43.050 --> 08:47.074
But in high school, we were aware that you just didn't fail.

08:47.754 --> 08:53.619
You know, in the early grades, we were not too aware of that part.

08:53.639 --> 08:59.805
In the lingo of my growing up, but I mean, if you weren't fairly intelligent, it wasn't too acceptable.

09:00.005 --> 09:00.185
Sure.

09:01.206 --> 09:05.630
In the lingo of my growing up, we would talk about slipping off from home and going to do something.

09:06.030 --> 09:08.252
If you all slipped off from home,

09:08.232 --> 09:12.521
and went to do something when, say, you were junior high, where did you slip off and go to?

09:15.887 --> 09:17.310
Gosh, I hadn't even thought of that.

09:18.012 --> 09:27.270
I was, in junior high school, we were beginning to, you know, have our little athletic teams, and I was not a great athlete, and

09:27.959 --> 09:32.848
probably not as motivated as my brother, but I was a member of all the teams.

09:32.868 --> 09:51.182
And, you know, you were involved in your class activities, and we had, beginning at that junior high school level, parties and so forth, and in parents' homes and at the Girl Scout Lodge in Bryan.

09:51.162 --> 09:58.340
We had a lot of activities of that sort.

09:59.002 --> 10:04.856
As a younger child, all of us looked forward to going to the college pool to swim in the summer.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.062
That was always a

10:07.042 --> 10:11.590
Because I understand you could get a family pass.

10:12.292 --> 10:14.336
I think Bill Lancaster told me it was $3 a summer.

10:14.416 --> 10:15.999
I heard someone else say that.

10:16.099 --> 10:21.128
I was not even aware that it was all just sort of taken care of as far as I was.

10:21.228 --> 10:24.274
I wasn't aware of paying for it.

10:24.254 --> 10:34.495
But I remember one of the big pleasures was to drop a penny in the deep end of the pool and see if we could get down to that level and retrieve it, you know.

10:34.635 --> 10:40.747
Did you all go play at the little lake on the south of the campus?

10:41.569 --> 10:42.311
That little pond?

10:42.491 --> 10:45.537
I can only remember going down to the lake a few times.

10:45.517 --> 10:55.234
We had a fairly contained environment and a lot of youngsters our age, at least my age, on campus.

10:55.996 --> 11:07.997
In fact, I was playing more with children, you know, several youngsters at the second house we lived in from 1935 to 40.

11:07.977 --> 11:09.199
40 or 41.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.703
And it was a neighborhood of all boys.

11:13.444 --> 11:27.522
The Gammons lived next to us, two sons, and Leland's on the other side, a son and a daughter, and Williams behind us was son and daughter, and Walker's sort of across the street in the next block.

11:27.502 --> 11:40.719
two sons, and Bill Echols, who was Dean Bolton's grandson, spent a great deal of time all summer with us in College Station.

11:40.739 --> 11:53.256
And so we just were doing everything from having acorn flights to... The gammons were a little older than we were.

11:53.725 --> 11:57.791
And Billy, the older son, was very inventive.

11:57.811 --> 12:00.955
And he developed what we called a Farquhar cannon.

12:00.975 --> 12:11.110
It was a foot or so, maybe longer, of plumbing-type pipe that was capped on the end with the cap pad.

12:11.090 --> 12:28.372
had a hole drill in it so you could put a firecracker wick through it and then through the other end of the barrel you put an acorn and this would blast an acorn out and it ignited and the firecracker ignited.

12:28.412 --> 12:32.777
One of the events I remember in particular was that

12:32.757 --> 12:47.982
Billy and I were in the little house behind the gunman's house that they'd converted into a sort of a storeroom and maybe a place for the boys to

12:47.962 --> 12:49.565
do a little carpentry or something.

12:50.967 --> 12:56.117
And we were in that building and firing our firecracker cannon out through an open window.

12:56.277 --> 13:06.796
And Sam Ray and all the other boys, the rest of the neighborhood boys, had a gigantic piece of plywood.

13:06.856 --> 13:09.160
And Sam Ray had one finger

13:09.140 --> 13:16.391
exposed, and that hand was holding the plywood so they'd be protected from our weapon.

13:16.411 --> 13:24.023
And believe it or not, our acorn hit his finger, and of course their fortification collapsed.

13:24.083 --> 13:30.112
And I always said that I think that's what moved Sam Ray toward diplomacy.

13:30.152 --> 13:33.818
You know, he later became a diplomat and an ambassador.

13:33.838 --> 13:37.003
But he didn't follow the military life at least.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.925
Let's see, did y'all have BB guns?

13:39.306 --> 13:41.588
Yes, they were a big bunch.

13:41.928 --> 13:44.091
And you used them on campus?

13:44.271 --> 13:49.797
Yes, we were shot at the little birds that couldn't get out of the way fast enough.

13:50.077 --> 13:52.340
Rubber guns?

13:52.580 --> 13:53.721
I don't remember rubber guns.

13:54.582 --> 14:05.134
Yes, they were there, but I mean that was, I think I went from the firecracker cannon and acorn flights to the BB gun and missed the rubber.

14:05.384 --> 14:15.076
You youngsters, did you ever ride your bikes and go to the gravel pits swimming where the cadets, where the corps members would swim?

14:15.556 --> 14:18.780
We rode our bikes to White's Canyon.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.602
Where's that?

14:21.023 --> 14:24.927
White's Canyon is southwest of College Station a few miles.

14:25.949 --> 14:33.838
It's an eroded area south of where the airport is, probably a mile or so.

14:33.818 --> 14:45.119
And the big attraction to White's Canyon was you could slide down the sides, especially if it were a little bit wet.

14:45.580 --> 14:50.629
And that was fun because it was enough to really have a nice slide.

14:50.609 --> 14:58.389
And I can remember riding the bike with a friend or so out to the Brazos River.

14:59.793 --> 15:05.788
We had gotten the idea we wanted to uncover some archaeological specimens out there, but we didn't find any fossils.

15:05.808 --> 15:07.352
But we did ride out.

15:07.332 --> 15:19.348
But on campus, a place that we really enjoyed riding our bicycles to was the administration building area, the terraced area.

15:20.229 --> 15:25.816
And I think the administration building went in about 35 or so.

15:25.836 --> 15:34.808
And it was fun to go down the terraced

15:34.788 --> 15:45.323
gradations, and then coming back, you'd have to put your front wheel up to get over the four or five inches of drop-off.

15:46.004 --> 16:02.989
Now, say when the, what we used to call the system administration building, now the Jack Kenny Williams building, when it was built facing east, a new Texas Avenue, new Highway 6, what did that

16:03.442 --> 16:10.109
Physically, what did that area look like where the bonfire is now held and where the golf course now is?

16:10.150 --> 16:11.191
What did it look like then?

16:11.211 --> 16:14.394
This was agricultural land.

16:15.115 --> 16:24.205
And the, just to the north of the, is it the Jack K. Williams building?

16:24.225 --> 16:26.728
The old systems building.

16:26.748 --> 16:32.014
Just down the hill to the north was the College of Veterinary Medicine.

16:31.994 --> 16:40.941
Previously, the College of Veterinary Medicine had been about a block from the Cushing Library in the early years.

16:42.659 --> 16:52.752
As a very, very young child, I can remember going through the original building, someone was showing me the jar specimens of all their unusual things.

16:52.772 --> 16:53.954
I remember that event.

16:53.974 --> 17:04.988
But by the middle 1930s, the vet school, veterinary school, was just north of the systems building, maybe 300 or 400 yards.

17:04.968 --> 17:11.143
And behind that, north of that and also east of that was, these were just pastures.

17:12.366 --> 17:15.855
And the College of the Animal Huntsmanry

17:16.527 --> 17:26.962
area in the College of Agriculture had the land, I guess you'd say, south of the Systems Administration Building.

17:26.982 --> 17:28.204
Where the golf course is now.

17:28.224 --> 17:29.526
Where the golf course is now.

17:30.187 --> 17:33.071
And that was pasture also?

17:33.392 --> 17:33.632
Yes.

17:34.494 --> 17:42.265
My dad said that when he first came here in the early 1920s, he could go out on the south

17:42.245 --> 17:55.324
east corner of this agricultural land and shoot, get a full limit of dove by time to go to the office.

17:57.688 --> 18:01.954
You mentioned maid that your family had for a long time.

18:01.974 --> 18:02.635
What's that?

18:02.675 --> 18:04.778
You mentioned family maid.

18:04.798 --> 18:06.160
Yes.

18:06.140 --> 18:08.265
Where did she live?

18:08.285 --> 18:15.380
Essentially, all the campus houses had a small house, a servant's house behind the house.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.003
And our maid lived there.

18:19.749 --> 18:21.212
Our maid was...

18:21.192 --> 18:32.686
Ruby McWilliams, a very wonderful person, very obese, loved food and loved to cook, and just was a sweet person.

18:33.787 --> 18:39.875
She was with us until the exodus of many people to California during the war.

18:40.555 --> 18:41.957
Now, was she black or white?

18:42.097 --> 18:42.778
Black.

18:42.758 --> 18:44.760
Where did she grow up?

18:44.780 --> 18:45.901
She grew up in Bryan.

18:47.103 --> 18:50.206
And many maids on the campus were black.

18:50.586 --> 18:53.069
Did any of them have children who were school age?

18:53.950 --> 18:54.531
Yes.

18:57.814 --> 19:05.763
Her son was older than we were, and of course, in those years, the schools were segregated, as you know.

19:05.783 --> 19:11.449
But Benny was a little older, and incidentally, Benny became a college graduate.

19:11.429 --> 19:13.332
Good, good.

19:13.412 --> 19:15.274
Now, where was, where did they go to school?

19:16.877 --> 19:18.739
He went to school in Bryan somewhere.

19:18.779 --> 19:19.200
In Bryan.

19:19.220 --> 19:21.803
But I don't, I presume in the Kemp system.

19:22.284 --> 19:24.767
And was there a school bus that came to pick them up?

19:25.148 --> 19:32.518
Well, actually, he was old enough so that he was not, didn't live with his mama.

19:32.538 --> 19:33.960
Oh, I see.

19:33.940 --> 19:39.748
And you don't have any idea what the compensation was for a maid in the 30s?

19:39.768 --> 19:47.518
Well, a mother used to proudly say she paid $1 more a month, a week, or whatever it was, than anyone else.

19:48.679 --> 19:50.842
But it was something like $6 a week.

19:51.843 --> 19:55.448
Of course, they had their house and they had their meals.

19:55.648 --> 19:57.311
So they had really more, in other words.

19:57.951 --> 19:59.914
But it was minimal.

19:59.894 --> 20:19.028
And I have always said, based on my very limited observation, the close, close relations between black and white southerners in those situations were so meaningful.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.953
And that your respect...

20:22.675 --> 20:26.309
for that person, that individual, was very, very high.

20:26.831 --> 20:27.775
Exactly.

20:28.538 --> 20:31.048
And I'm assuming when your mother was not there,

20:32.092 --> 20:34.314
Ruby was there ordinarily, yes.

20:34.394 --> 20:35.055
And she was in charge.

20:35.075 --> 20:36.075
Except on Sundays, yes.

20:36.436 --> 20:45.183
And that if Ruby gave you a direction, you knew to follow it, or you might have to explain it to your mother.

20:46.104 --> 20:53.651
That's true, but Ruby was such a nice person, it was really, she had a hard time being too authoritarian.

20:53.671 --> 20:58.595
But we, I think we responded, we did what we were supposed to do, yeah.

20:58.615 --> 21:02.098
All right, let's reach back now and pick up your father's career.

21:02.078 --> 21:09.329
He and your mother got married in the mid-twenties and at that point his responsibilities were what?

21:09.349 --> 21:12.273
My dad was the freshman coach for five years.

21:12.854 --> 21:14.116
For football.

21:14.937 --> 21:17.982
Football and basketball.

21:18.002 --> 21:18.923
And basketball.

21:18.903 --> 21:26.034
DX Bible was a basketball coach, and both Dad and DX Bible were football people.

21:26.315 --> 21:33.766
And Dad once said that the only thing that he and DX Bible knew about basketball was to throw the ball up and get out of the way.

21:35.970 --> 21:40.897
Being five feet seven inches tall, I guess that wasn't a bad idea anyway.

21:40.917 --> 21:43.161
But they had great teams.

21:43.181 --> 21:47.087
DX Bible's teams won the conference championship.

21:47.067 --> 21:58.741
And believe it or not, one year, Dad's freshman football basketball team beat the Sam Houston team two times, and the Sam Houston team came over and beat the N.M.

21:58.762 --> 22:01.285
Varsity one out of two times.

22:02.666 --> 22:07.512
And that was a Southwest Conference champion team, and the freshman team beat the team that beat them.

22:07.532 --> 22:10.476
In those years, where was basketball played?

22:10.456 --> 22:13.241
It was played in DeWare Fieldhouse.

22:13.261 --> 22:14.683
DeWare was already there.

22:14.703 --> 22:14.964
Yes.

22:15.044 --> 22:23.759
Now, there was an older wooden structure west of the P.L.

22:23.780 --> 22:26.665
Downs Natatorium that was still in existence.

22:27.105 --> 22:35.400
And I presume it may have been where the basketball was played prior to DeWare Fieldhouse being built.

22:35.380 --> 22:40.147
Now, an interesting story, this is more related to football and baseball, is this.

22:41.188 --> 22:52.023
Dad said that when he came here in 1920 and in those earlier years, that the football stadium, at the end of football season, it was a wooden structure.

22:52.724 --> 22:54.807
It was dismantled.

22:54.787 --> 22:59.371
and moved over to the baseball area.

22:59.391 --> 23:09.181
And then it became the baseball stadium during spring, and then it was moved back, presumably in the summer, to the football field.

23:09.201 --> 23:13.565
So it was one stadium, but two different locations.

23:15.587 --> 23:17.829
But it was wooden and could be dismantled.

23:18.390 --> 23:22.954
Now, your mentioning of the stadium caused me to think of the name Kyle.

23:23.390 --> 23:26.517
Was Dean Kyle around in your memory?

23:26.537 --> 23:27.460
Yes.

23:28.342 --> 23:40.470
Dean Kyle graduated sometime in the early 1900s, and I think he had a master's degree, as I remember.

23:40.450 --> 23:46.421
and was headed the, at least by the time I could remember it, was dean of agriculture.

23:47.363 --> 23:55.658
And he was also, in the 1920s, I think, chairman of the athletic council and the faculty of the athletic council.

23:55.638 --> 23:58.663
Was it called Kyle Field in your early memories?

23:59.745 --> 24:03.191
From my time on, yes.

24:03.211 --> 24:14.670
I don't know exactly when it was named Kyle Field, but that was in the 1920s, in the middle 20s, in the late 20s, that's when the concrete stadium began.

24:14.911 --> 24:17.595
I think it was built in two different parts.

24:17.575 --> 24:28.115
And he was Dr. Dean Kyle was very, probably headed the council at that time.

24:28.135 --> 24:30.079
At least the first position.

24:30.099 --> 24:30.299
All right.

24:30.319 --> 24:32.684
Your dad did freshman on football.

24:32.744 --> 24:36.090
He coached freshman football, but I presume that also meant

24:36.070 --> 24:42.821
When the varsity played, he was there as a member of the staff on Saturday to help with those games, too.

24:42.861 --> 24:48.309
Well, actually, he, no, he scouted other teams.

24:48.610 --> 24:51.615
Oh, so he'd be on the road then?

24:51.695 --> 24:51.835
Mm-hmm.

24:51.815 --> 24:59.368
So, I guess the freshman games were on Friday or the day before the varsity games.

25:00.350 --> 25:08.344
And in fact, in his five years of coaching, they lost, A&M freshman teams lost only two football games.

25:09.266 --> 25:15.477
And I've looked through some yearbooks, and the one loss record then was remarkable.

25:15.457 --> 25:18.582
And of course, the varsity record was great too.

25:19.763 --> 25:33.904
Probably the greatest athlete that was on dad's freshman football team was Joel Hunt, who the early teams in the early 20s, I think the A&M

25:33.884 --> 25:38.410
football teams that were winning were balanced teams.

25:38.430 --> 25:46.940
And in the middle 20s, thanks to Joel Hunt, A&M won two Southwest Conference championships in football.

25:46.960 --> 25:57.012
But those teams were not as probably quite as well balanced and they depended more on his excellence.

25:58.054 --> 26:00.837
And one of the problems A&M began to face

26:00.817 --> 26:17.682
in those years was as the two city schools, SMU and Rice, began developing aspirations athletically, they became active in recruiting.

26:18.824 --> 26:21.087
And the ex-Bible did not believe in recruiting.

26:23.108 --> 26:28.676
In those years, obviously, to remain a successful coach, he did change as time went on.

26:28.696 --> 26:30.178
At first, he did not.

26:30.319 --> 26:37.369
But A&M did not do, did not really actively recruit, and so these other teams began to pull up.

26:38.250 --> 26:48.205
And as I say, the reason that A&M won those two championships, I think in 25 and 27 in football, was more of the individual brilliance of this guy.

26:48.185 --> 26:50.671
Joel Hunt.

26:51.734 --> 26:52.917
Where did Hunt grow up?

26:52.937 --> 26:53.398
Do you remember?

26:53.498 --> 26:54.921
Hunt, where was he from?

26:54.962 --> 26:56.646
He was, I believe, a Waco boy.

26:56.846 --> 27:03.342
Do you remember any stories your dad passed on about recruiting in the 20s?

27:03.727 --> 27:04.528
how they did it?

27:06.311 --> 27:09.196
Frankly, I don't think they did much recruiting in those years.

27:10.859 --> 27:27.186
A&M did have an invitational track meet for high school boys that was a casualty of the repression, but that way at least a high school track and field man could get on campus and see what was here.

27:27.166 --> 27:39.590
Recruiting us, in my dad's experience, really was not something that was actually actively done until he returned to track and field coaching after World War II.

27:40.351 --> 27:43.076
So that youngster came here literally on his own.

27:43.196 --> 27:43.457
Correct.

27:43.477 --> 27:44.599
Did they get scholarships?

27:45.180 --> 27:45.681
No.

27:46.505 --> 27:58.282
By the late 1920s, to be competitive with some of the other schools, athletes were given waiter's jobs, but they worked.

28:02.168 --> 28:03.210
Okay.

28:03.330 --> 28:04.532
Let's sidetrack on that.

28:05.313 --> 28:09.559
How often did you all eat in Cebiza, you as a family?

28:11.311 --> 28:12.894
Practically never.

28:13.675 --> 28:16.119
So you ate it, ate almost all your meals at home?

28:16.239 --> 28:17.822
Correct.

28:17.842 --> 28:17.942
Yeah.

28:17.962 --> 28:20.887
Was that unusual for the faculty families?

28:21.648 --> 28:23.472
I think that was true generally.

28:24.333 --> 28:27.919
The mess hall was

28:27.899 --> 28:35.830
And incidentally, Dad said that the man for whom it was named was from Switzerland, I believe.

28:37.292 --> 28:39.535
But he pronounced it Spisa.

28:40.075 --> 28:44.581
Now, everybody at NM, all the cadets would call it Sabisa or something.

28:44.601 --> 28:46.784
But he pronounced it Spisa.

28:46.965 --> 28:50.970
Did he ever pass on any anecdotes about that man?

28:50.950 --> 29:05.810
No, he didn't, but I remember Mr. Duncan, for whom Duncan Hall was named, he was a very white-haired person, rather florid complexion.

29:07.792 --> 29:09.735
I remember once Dad had

29:11.234 --> 29:14.160
to go to the mess hall for something to talk to Mr. Duncan.

29:14.180 --> 29:16.806
And Mr. Duncan, I was along with Dad.

29:16.846 --> 29:22.518
And so he had me stop by the sweet roll area.

29:23.720 --> 29:29.833
And he gave me more sweet rolls than I could eat in a month, I think.

29:30.877 --> 29:35.024
My memory was that he was a very kind person.

29:35.785 --> 29:40.533
And the reputation of the quality of the food then was high?

29:40.793 --> 29:41.435
I think it was high.

29:41.755 --> 29:48.987
See, it was mainly a cadet corps mess hall, and I don't think there was anything really set up for

29:48.967 --> 29:56.596
for other than that except for faculty dinners, and I presume other dinners.

29:57.277 --> 30:01.742
But I think there was always at least one annual faculty dinner.

30:02.343 --> 30:02.563
All right.

30:03.364 --> 30:06.308
And Coach Bible leaves to go to Nebraska.

30:07.429 --> 30:11.094
Do you remember any, do you ever hear any stories about why he left?

30:11.594 --> 30:14.738
Did they pay him that much more money or?

30:17.300 --> 30:25.831
I think he felt it was a strategic time to leave because it was apparent that with the other teams recruiting and AIM not.

30:26.692 --> 30:42.092
And AIM also had a tremendous disadvantage in recruiting because a lot of good students and good athletes did not want to be a cadet.

30:42.747 --> 30:49.104
Because after all, it was an involuntary system that you had to be a cadet.

30:50.046 --> 30:58.950
And so if you were sought after academically or sought after athletically and you were courted by other schools,

30:58.930 --> 31:07.165
then A&M had a disadvantage, plus the fact that, as I mentioned, A&M did not recruit anyway.

31:08.066 --> 31:20.909
And the point was, I think the ex-bible could see that if his two last championship teams had not had a super athlete, that they would have been in the middle of the conference.

31:20.929 --> 31:23.554
And I think he felt that this was

31:23.534 --> 31:29.165
It would be to his career advantage to be at a school that had a fine tradition athletically.

31:29.425 --> 31:33.293
As far as you know, he did not, there was no bitterness or rancor.

31:33.313 --> 31:34.515
Absolutely none, no.

31:34.535 --> 31:35.898
And he left entirely of his own?

31:36.339 --> 31:38.102
Correct, yeah.

31:38.122 --> 31:39.064
Now does your dad's?

31:39.124 --> 31:46.318
In fact, I think that the Athletic Council agreed to meet his salary.
