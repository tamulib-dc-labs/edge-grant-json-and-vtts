00:02.107 --> 00:07.613
This is an interview with Dr. William D. Van 
Ganten, head of the Department of Petroleum

00:02.107 --> 00:07.613
Engineering. Today's date is October 23, 1981. 
Let's begin, Dr. Van Ganten, by you telling us

00:11.216 --> 00:18.684
something about your early years in Rockdale and 
Corsicana. You were born in Rockdale in 1934.

00:23.109 --> 00:23.809
That's correct. I was born in 1934, and I lived 
there until 1937, and my family moved to

00:24.690 --> 00:31.337
Corsicana. And I grew up in Corsicana all the way 
through high school. I graduated in 52 and came to

00:38.925 --> 00:46.255
Texas A&M at that time as an undergraduate 
student. What was your father's occupation? He

00:48.377 --> 00:51.101
was a oil field worker. Worked in the woodbine 
field there in Corsicana and then later

01:00.713 --> 01:04.038
W-O-O-D-B-I-N-E. One word? Yes. Woodbine Field 
in Corsicana. And later moved to what's called the

01:08.023 --> 01:18.238
Shallow Field in Corsicana, which was right next 
to the town itself. So I grew up living in the oil

01:20.681 --> 01:23.425
field. And so I worked, of course, in the summers. 
for the oil companies there. All the way while I was

01:31.658 --> 01:37.964
in school here at A&M, I continued to work in the 
summers for the oil companies around Corsicana.

01:37.984 --> 01:44.150
What recollections do you have of how the oil 
companies were operating in the forest when you

01:37.984 --> 01:44.150
were growing up? Well, the operations around 
Corsicana were all independent oil operators,

01:44.170 --> 01:57.402
and it was a very hard time economically as far as 
the oil companies. The oil price of oil was very low

01:59.017 --> 02:14.013
and they were pretty much shoestring type 
operations and so there weren't any of the very few

01:59.017 --> 02:14.013
of the modern technological type procedures that 
we use today were employed there. Did many of the

02:14.774 --> 02:21.160
wildcatters in that area make a lot of money out of 
this? Not too many. During the 40s was not a real

02:23.423 --> 02:28.568
boom economically and the companies were of 
course, were in a bad condition before World War

02:29.543 --> 02:37.154
II, and they really didn't get in through the 40s. 
They were still in fairly bad economic condition.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.986
What was it that brought them out of this bad 
economic condition? Well, really the oil company

02:45.006 --> 02:53.739
stayed in a fairly bad economic condition up until 
about 1973 when the Arab oil embargo occurred.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.142
When the price of... unsatisfactory financial 
condition up to this time well there was an

02:58.433 --> 03:23.968
abundance of oil and gas the there was more oil a lot 
more oil available than the need was and when

02:58.433 --> 03:23.968
you've got a surplus of anything the price is 
naturally not going to increase and so during that

02:58.433 --> 03:23.968
period of time there was due to inflation and 
different factors the The cost of doing business

03:24.472 --> 03:30.882
was increasing, but the value of the oil wasn't 
increasing much, and so it put the companies in a

03:24.472 --> 03:30.882
squeeze.

03:34.387 --> 03:38.294
You decided then to come to A&M to major in 
petroleum engineering? That's correct. Because

03:39.435 --> 03:44.904
as a boy you were around oil field work, and that's 
how you got your interest in petroleum? That's

03:44.924 --> 03:45.405
right. And you came here in 1952? Came here to A&M in 
1952. which of course was in the class of 56. I

03:54.461 --> 04:05.672
started out majoring in petroleum and then before 
I finished I decided that I also wanted to get a

03:54.461 --> 04:05.672
degree in geology. So I got a dual degree which took 
five years, a BS in petroleum and a BS in geology.

04:13.239 --> 04:15.481
Graduated in 1957.

04:18.224 --> 04:21.867
Why did you have an interest in geology? geology 
ties in directly with petroleum engineering, and

04:22.370 --> 04:33.006
really to be a good petroleum reservoir engineer, 
you need to have a good background in geology. And

04:34.769 --> 04:37.833
then you stayed on here and got your advanced 
degrees here also? Well, of course, in 57 I left and

04:37.853 --> 04:44.023
went to work with Magnolia Petroleum Company. 
Where? In Vanderbilt, which was down close to

04:45.965 --> 04:50.352
Victoria. But Magnolia Petroleum Company became 
Mobile Oil Company with their reorganization in

04:52.002 --> 04:58.311
1960. So between 57 and 62, during that time, I 
worked for Magnolia for one year. I went into the

05:11.669 --> 05:16.035
service, into the Air Force, spent two years in the 
Air Force. came back to Magnolia, but this was in

05:16.707 --> 05:19.670
1960. When I came back, it was now Mobile. They 
changed the name in the first part of 1960. And I

05:27.038 --> 05:32.544
worked for Mobile for two more years before I came 
back to A&M to graduate school. How long were you

05:34.907 --> 05:36.228
here for graduate school? I was here in graduate 
school for four years. Came in 62 and graduated in

05:39.632 --> 05:43.997
66 with a PhD. So I got a master's in petroleum 
engineering and a doctorate in petroleum

05:44.517 --> 05:48.182
engineering. What was the topic of your research? 
Research was in some of the fundamental

05:52.046 --> 05:57.473
properties of reservoir rock. How to, dealing 
primarily with logging properties, on how to

05:59.355 --> 06:10.169
predict fluid saturations in the reservoir rock 
from well logs.

06:13.053 --> 06:14.254
And then you became a... I became a member of the 
faculty in 1966. What rank? I started out as an

06:22.717 --> 06:27.986
assistant professor.

06:31.292 --> 06:33.095
Well, I guess I take it back. In 1966, I became a 
research professor.

06:40.508 --> 06:44.895
assistant or associate, I forget which it was, 
with the engineering experiment station. And I

06:46.056 --> 06:48.941
kept that job for one year. And then I joined the 
teaching staff in 67. And you became department

06:52.526 --> 06:57.273
head when? 76.

07:02.381 --> 07:07.309
What are some of the duties that you perform as your 
best department head? Well, as department head,

07:09.550 --> 07:21.262
Of course, A&M has department head rather than 
department chairman, which the department head

07:09.550 --> 07:21.262
pretty much has the sole responsibility for the 
department. I have to recruit faculty for the

07:23.044 --> 07:32.394
department to ensure that we have adequate 
faculty to teach the courses. I prepare the budget

07:33.735 --> 07:35.958
for the department. I administer the budget once 
it is approved. I'm in charge of the personnel

07:38.930 --> 07:55.387
within the department, all the secretarial 
force, the bookkeeping force, reproducing

07:38.930 --> 07:55.387
section, plus the teaching faculty themselves.

07:59.211 --> 08:02.635
How many people are under your supervision? We've 
got 24 faculty members.

08:08.528 --> 08:12.454
seven staff members under my supervision.

08:16.620 --> 08:23.591
You became department head after the demand for 
patrol increased as a result of that embargo.

08:23.651 --> 08:29.080
Discuss how the department changed between the 
time before that and after. What an effect would

08:29.140 --> 08:32.545
this have on the department? and look at the time 
that I came to the petroleum engineering, came

08:32.828 --> 08:44.688
back to graduate school in 62, we had very few 
students in petroleum engineering at that time. I

08:46.250 --> 08:53.282
don't actually have the records here, but it's 
something like 100 students I would say total in

08:46.250 --> 08:53.282
petroleum engineering. And from 62 up until

09:00.453 --> 09:09.188
the time of the Arab oil embargo, there was very 
little increase in the number of students

09:00.453 --> 09:09.188
enrolled in petroleum. I think in 1973 we had 140 
students that were enrolled in petroleum

09:09.228 --> 09:13.475
engineering.

09:16.280 --> 09:23.693
During that period of time, the

09:16.280 --> 09:23.693
cost of oil was very low. we were producing, or we 
had the capacity to produce more oil than the

09:24.601 --> 09:31.069
country could actually utilize. The country was 
importing a lot of oil at, or was importing oil at a

09:33.472 --> 09:41.342
very cheap price. Cheaper than it could be 
produced here. So there was very little incentive

09:45.587 --> 09:53.697
to develop our own petroleum resources, any 
additional petroleum resources. So we were

09:54.723 --> 09:59.769
developing few of our own resources. The demand 
was continuing to increase during that period.

10:05.915 --> 10:18.269
Anytime that happens, you're going to get to a 
situation, finally, where the demand is going to

10:05.915 --> 10:18.269
exceed the production, exceed the supply, which 
occurred back before 1973.

10:20.471 --> 10:24.696
But finally, by 73, we were very dependent on 
imports of oil to satisfy our domestic needs. So I

10:30.962 --> 10:42.314
guess the Arabs finally wised up to what was going 
on, the state of things, that they now were in the

10:30.962 --> 10:42.314
driver's seat, not the United States, as far as oil 
prices were concerned. So they started to

10:43.496 --> 10:46.639
increase oil prices. As they did this, everyone 
realized that we had not done the exploration that

10:55.844 --> 10:57.706
we should have. We had not developed the new 
reserves that we should have and now we were in a

10:57.766 --> 11:07.558
situation where we were relying very heavily on 
countries that we had no control over. So

11:07.598 --> 11:17.110
beginning in about 73 with the embargo there was a 
big push in the United States to try to increase

11:07.598 --> 11:17.110
domestic production. Well all during the 60s 
there was a big environmental push in the United

11:18.571 --> 11:24.819
States. Everyone was very much concerned about 
the environment no one really was worrying about

11:26.067 --> 11:51.771
our energy situation because they had sort of 
taken the energy situation for granted so there

11:26.067 --> 11:51.771
were there were a lot of restrictions that were 
placed on not only petroleum industry but all

11:26.067 --> 11:51.771
industries during the 60s trying to make sure that 
the environment was not damaged in any way and

11:26.067 --> 11:51.771
really a lot of these restrictions were not very 
well thought out Well, anyway, beginning in about

11:52.713 --> 12:04.370
73 then with the Arab oil embargo, there was a big 
push with the price going up that made more funds

11:52.713 --> 12:04.370
available to do exploration. So there was a big 
push in this country to increase the level of

12:05.291 --> 12:13.663
exploration to try to find more oil ourselves. 
When did it become economically feasible to

12:14.004 --> 12:19.352
increase the oil production in the United States? 
Well, I think it became feasible in about 73. when

12:23.223 --> 12:24.946
the price went up. Up until that time, it really 
wasn't economical to do new expiration. Your

12:29.773 --> 12:30.654
expiration cost. How low the price was, or how much 
would the price have to bend to make it feasible to

12:30.814 --> 12:37.645
produce it? Oh, that's hard to say. You know, in 73, 
the price was about $3 a barrel. And right now, it's

12:44.795 --> 12:47.599
$35 a barrel. So in eight years, it has gone up more 
than a factor of 10. Well,

12:54.172 --> 13:00.338
the oil does not cost the same amount. Every barrel 
of oil you produce does not cost the same amount.

13:03.141 --> 13:05.003
Some oil is harder to find than others. So some of 
it's going to cost you more money than others does.

13:08.446 --> 13:17.055
So when the price went from $3 a barrel to $6 a 
barrel, that made some fields economical to

13:08.446 --> 13:17.055
explore and produce. Whether or not the field is 
economical depends on how hard it is to get the oil.

13:22.821 --> 13:23.301
That's right. how hard it is to get it out of the 
ground and how hard it is to find. You know, how many

13:26.453 --> 13:29.598
dry holes you're going to have to drill before you 
find a producer. Well, when did the situation

13:31.841 --> 13:37.489
start to improve after all companies started to 
increase? Well, as far as with Texas A&M, as far as

13:37.510 --> 13:46.343
the petroleum department, we had an almost 
instantaneous increase in enrollment beginning

13:37.510 --> 13:46.343
in 73. And it has been increasing every year since 
then. Right now, we're averaging about 30% per

13:52.137 --> 13:58.563
year increase in enrollment in the department.

14:00.565 --> 14:06.831
Last year, we had 1,050

14:00.565 --> 14:06.831
students in the department. This year, we've got 
1,450 students in the department. Here at A&M,

14:11.936 --> 14:21.925
it's about third in size, I think. Mechanical 
engineering is probably the largest with about

14:22.630 --> 14:31.682
1,800 students, and electrical engineering is 
the next largest, and then petroleum. But as this

14:31.702 --> 14:38.892
demand for oil increased, so did the salaries paid 
to the petroleum engineers and where that

14:31.702 --> 14:38.892
happened. That's right. Can you discuss that, 
please? Well, the petroleum engineering

14:41.275 --> 14:47.203
salaries have, for the past five years anyway, 
have been averaging $200 to $300 a month more than

14:47.757 --> 14:54.429
the salaries paid to other engineers. So that also 
has aided in the rapid growth in petroleum

14:55.851 --> 15:12.060
engineering here at A&M because we've had 
students that were majoring in other areas of

14:55.851 --> 15:12.060
engineering that have transferred over to 
petroleum.

15:13.576 --> 15:21.587
Well, I can say last May, in May of 81, the average 
starting salary was $2,302 a month for a petroleum

15:13.576 --> 15:21.587
engineer. And it was around $2,000 a month for the 
average of the other engineers. And from what I can

15:27.154 --> 15:35.726
see now, the average starting salary for May of 82 
is going to be somewhere in the range of $2,600 a

15:27.154 --> 15:35.726
month. It's going up about 13%, 14% a year. What was 
the salary level before the embargo in comparison

15:41.318 --> 15:49.246
to other fields of engineering?

15:50.487 --> 15:54.291
Was it running less or the same? Petroleum 
engineering was running the same as other fields

15:54.471 --> 16:00.417
of engineering up until the time of the embargo.

16:06.323 --> 16:10.887
How do you assess the quality of the students that 
you're getting in this field? The

16:12.807 --> 16:20.255
quality of the students that we're getting or the 
students that we're putting out? Both. Well,

16:21.876 --> 16:30.906
we have most knowledge of the students that we're 
putting out. The students that we get, we really

16:31.867 --> 16:37.032
don't teach them many courses until their junior 
year. So we have students that come into petroleum

16:38.093 --> 16:41.717
engineering, they're majoring in petroleum, 
they're here for maybe here for two years and then

16:42.406 --> 16:52.640
transfer out to some other major and we never see 
them and they transfer out because they're not

16:42.406 --> 16:52.640
doing well in math and chemistry and physics and 
that sort of thing. I would, in overall, I would say

16:54.462 --> 17:04.496
in the last five years that the quality of the 
incoming student probably hasn't increased any.

17:04.516 --> 17:05.858
Has not increased any. It's probably about 
constant. Even though the I think the SAT scores of

17:11.532 --> 17:15.798
our students have increased slightly. I think as 
far as the university is concerned, they have

17:16.739 --> 17:20.544
increased some. As far as our department is 
concerned, I think they're probably about

17:20.604 --> 17:24.910
constant. And I think the quality of the student 
that we're producing is about the same as it was

17:26.513 --> 17:38.569
eight years ago.

17:39.038 --> 17:47.370
has been hard to maintain that quality, because as 
your numbers increase, the students do not get as

17:39.038 --> 17:47.370
much individual attention. And in a normal 
situation, you would expect the quality to

17:48.412 --> 17:53.599
deteriorate as the numbers increase. I think 
right

17:55.822 --> 18:06.598
now, our senior class has about 175 students in it, 
and our junior class has about 190 students in it.

18:07.439 --> 18:11.926
We've got a sophomore class that has about 400 and a 
freshman class that has about 600. I think the

18:12.026 --> 18:19.518
quality of our junior and senior students is very 
good. I think they're going to be excellent

18:19.598 --> 18:22.983
engineers when they graduate. I can't really say 
to the quality of the freshman and sophomore

18:24.465 --> 18:32.037
students because we haven't had that much 
interaction with them. What about female

18:32.057 --> 18:33.459
students? Have you had an increase of women 
students? Well, we have about 15% female in the

18:36.143 --> 18:42.369
department right now. And we have had that same 
percentage for about the last three years, I'd

18:42.389 --> 18:47.073
say. But of course, it wasn't too many years ago 
that we didn't have any females at A&M. But we've

18:52.759 --> 19:00.586
sort of hit a constant situation now on the 
percentage of females enrolled in the

18:52.759 --> 19:00.586
department. What do you think attracts females to 
petroleum engineering? I think it's the same

19:04.763 --> 19:07.728
thing that attracts the males into it. It's the 
good salary situation and the chance to do

19:07.748 --> 19:18.144
something meaningful in this day when we have an 
energy crisis.

19:21.749 --> 19:25.155
Where are some of the places that petroleum 
engineers work? Well, of course they work where

19:27.258 --> 19:31.885
the oil fields are and where the the major offices 
of the oil companies, where they're located, and

19:32.557 --> 19:59.762
this is primarily in Texas, both the Gulf Coast 
area, East Texas, West Texas, in Louisiana,

19:32.557 --> 19:59.762
primarily along the coast and offshore, offshore 
Texas, New Mexico, the Rocky Mountain region with

19:32.557 --> 19:59.762
the new overthrust production, California, 
Alaska. Could you comment on the Alaska oil rush?

20:08.631 --> 20:12.075
Well, I don't know whether I would call it the 
Alaska oil rush or not. I mean, there was a major

20:12.095 --> 20:16.620
field discovered in Alaska, and that field has 
pretty well been developed. And I think things are

20:17.441 --> 20:27.251
fairly stationary in Alaska now, you know, as far 
as the amount of operations that are going on. It's

20:27.271 --> 20:28.973
a very nice oil field, and Of course, I'd like to see 
us discover some more fields like that up there,

20:30.083 --> 20:36.809
but up to this point, that one field has been the 
only major field that's been discovered. Has the

20:38.931 --> 20:47.219
Texas oil fields encountered any opposition from 
environmentalists, any organized opposition?

20:47.239 --> 20:54.485
Well, I

20:47.239 --> 20:54.485
don't really know how to answer that. We haven't 
had anybody marching at the oil fields like...

20:58.045 --> 21:00.388
They did at Diablo Canyon Nuclear Plant. We 
haven't had anything like that. I think Texas is

21:01.910 --> 21:12.762
fairly receptive to energy exploration, 
production, refining, that sort of thing,

21:01.910 --> 21:12.762
because there's a large percentage of the people 
in the state make their livelihood from that. But

21:13.743 --> 21:20.772
that doesn't mean to say that the oil companies 
don't really have to toe the line as far as the

21:13.743 --> 21:20.772
environment is concerned. The Railroad 
Commission in the state of Texas federal

21:26.783 --> 21:31.629
government have a set of regulations that the oil 
companies have to follow. And it has made

21:32.910 --> 21:42.121
operations a lot more expensive than they were 
back in the days before they went into effect. Let

21:42.161 --> 21:44.664
me ask you another question about your steel 
population. What about the number of blacks? Do

21:47.147 --> 21:50.991
you have a small number in your soap line? Well, I 
guess I can answer that by saying Texas A&M has a

21:51.011 --> 21:55.997
small number.

21:57.378 --> 22:06.251
I don't believe that there is any prejudice 
against a black student at Texas A&M or in

21:57.378 --> 22:06.251
petroleum engineering. I think it's just a matter 
of the students that can qualify, that can make the

22:07.273 --> 22:16.287
grades, are treated just like they're all treated 
the same, whatever their color is. Do you have any

22:18.610 --> 22:24.499
efforts to recruit blacks in this department? 
really aren't out recruiting any kind of students

22:24.783 --> 22:49.272
we've got a lot of students that come to us in the 
last five years we haven't had to do a whole lot of

22:24.783 --> 22:49.272
recruiting ourselves

22:24.783 --> 22:49.272
most

22:24.783 --> 22:49.272
of our faculty members are 75% teaching 25% 
research and with the Large increases in

22:49.808 --> 22:56.674
enrollment that we've had, this has taken its 
toll, I guess you might say, as far as research is

22:49.808 --> 22:56.674
concerned. We are not doing as much research as we 
would like to be doing, although we're probably

22:57.795 --> 23:05.523
doing a lot more research than we were five years 
ago. What are some of the research projects that

23:06.103 --> 23:10.908
are underway now that have recently been 
completed? We have three or four areas that we're

23:10.928 --> 23:16.693
doing most of our research in. One of these is 
numerical simulation. We have our own computer

23:20.875 --> 23:24.640
here in the department. And the numerical 
simulation of oil and gas reservoirs is a big area

23:24.660 --> 23:30.969
of research. By this, we are able to predict how a 
reservoir is going to perform under different

23:32.771 --> 23:40.221
type conditions, doing it with a mathematical 
model. Another area, a large area, is underground

23:41.944 --> 23:46.410
lignite gasification. We've done laboratory 
experiments and we also have had several field

23:47.453 --> 24:02.692
tests involving the burning of lignite in the 
ground and recovering the energy from the lignite

23:47.453 --> 24:02.692
at the surface in the form of a gas. This project is 
still an active project. Of course our numerical

24:08.359 --> 24:12.864
simulation is still an active area. We have a good 
bit of effort in what's called enhanced recovery

24:17.137 --> 24:20.222
of oil and gas. And this involves injecting of some 
type of fluid into the reservoir to get a higher

24:21.083 --> 24:27.654
recovery of the oil that's contained within the 
reservoir. We also have a large area of expertise

24:29.577 --> 24:42.317
in stimulation of low permeability reservoirs, 
primarily the hydraulic fracturing of tight gas

24:29.577 --> 24:42.317
reservoirs. Those four areas are our primary 
areas of research.

24:53.072 --> 24:57.036
Most of the money for financing research comes 
from external support.

24:59.739 --> 25:07.748
We, of course, work through the Texas Engineering 
Experiment Station, so we do get some state

24:59.739 --> 25:07.748
funding through the Experiment Station. but we 
have external funding coming through, some of it

25:08.723 --> 25:23.363
through the Department of Energy, but I would say 
the bulk of it is coming from oil companies and

25:08.723 --> 25:23.363
energy companies that are investing in various 
research projects in the department.

25:26.267 --> 25:31.614
Where are some of the schools your faculty

25:26.267 --> 25:31.614
members have come from? Oh, we have members that 
have gone to Penn State, Oklahoma, Georgia Tech,

25:39.352 --> 25:51.648
New Mexico Tech,

25:39.352 --> 25:51.648
Texas A&M, of course, University of Texas.

25:51.668 --> 26:02.583
I guess that's about three-fourths of them have 
PhDs.

26:02.603 --> 26:07.249
How does your petroleum engineering program at 
A&M compare with those at other universities?

26:08.225 --> 26:14.752
Well, our program here is the largest petroleum 
department in the nation, as far as students are

26:08.225 --> 26:14.752
concerned. And what the runner-ups are? Oh, as far 
as number of students, University of Texas is

26:18.035 --> 26:30.808
second, and probably

26:18.035 --> 26:30.808
LSU or Tulsa would be third. University of Tulsa? 
Mm-hmm. As far as the number of faculty, we have the

26:34.735 --> 26:38.902
largest faculty. And here again, I would imagine 
Texas probably has the second largest faculty and

26:39.443 --> 26:46.355
probably Stanford has the third largest faculty. 
Our department is rated by National Education

26:47.777 --> 26:55.230
Standards as the number one petroleum 
engineering department in the nation. And it's

26:55.250 --> 26:58.896
rated both at the graduate level and the 
undergraduate level as number one. How long has it

26:58.916 --> 27:00.439
been rated so far? Oh, I'm aware of it for at least 
the last five years that it's been ranked that way.

27:08.760 --> 27:10.903
Let's discuss the graduate program. Are both 
Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy

27:10.923 --> 27:15.529
degrees awarded? We have Master of Science, 
Master of Engineering, Doctor of Philosophy, and

27:15.549 --> 27:20.796
Doctor of Engineering degrees. Do you have any 
idea on the numbers enrolled in these programs? We

27:26.324 --> 27:31.050
have, I think, 27 graduate students enrolled 
right now. and that's about five at the doctorate

27:31.469 --> 27:36.854
level and the others at the master's level. Are 
many of the graduate students foreign students?

27:40.097 --> 27:40.797
Not too many. We have probably a third of the 
graduate students that are foreign nationals. We

27:48.444 --> 27:54.390
have a very small percentage of our undergraduate 
students that are foreign nationals, probably

27:48.444 --> 27:54.390
not over one or two percent. Why do you suppose that 
is when some of these other engineering

27:54.410 --> 28:01.476
departments have pretty large numbers of foreign 
students? I think the number of foreign students

28:02.553 --> 28:14.888
that we have is a function of our entrance 
requirements, that we have not given any

28:02.553 --> 28:14.888
financial support to any foreign nationals. And 
the foreign nationals have to meet the same

28:14.908 --> 28:20.535
entrance requirement as our U.S. students. And 
using that criteria, we have come up with about not

28:20.555 --> 28:27.463
too many foreign nationals in the program. Do some 
of the other departments have more lenient

28:27.781 --> 28:37.700
requirements for law enforcement?

28:37.720 --> 28:38.421
I don't know about that. Do holders of advanced 
degrees in petroleum engineering command larger

28:38.441 --> 28:44.372
salaries than those with a bachelor's degree? 
Yes, I would say that a master's degree probably

28:45.753 --> 28:57.990
gets a student about $200 or so a month more than 
what a bachelor's degree would get, beginning

28:45.753 --> 28:57.990
salary. And we really don't have enough PhDs 
coming out. They certainly command more than a

29:03.473 --> 29:11.566
master's, but I don't have a good handle on what the 
starting salary for a PhD is. Is it difficult to

29:11.586 --> 29:17.916
convince students to obtain graduate degrees for 
high salaries they're offered with bachelor

29:11.586 --> 29:17.916
degrees? Yes, it's very difficult to do that. And 
we're making a fairly large push right now to try to

29:20.680 --> 29:28.652
increase the number of students that we have in the 
graduate program. The industry needs more people

29:29.594 --> 29:35.519
with graduate degrees, and the universities need 
more teachers. There's a very serious problem in

29:36.500 --> 29:41.745
the nation today trying to get engineering 
teachers, engineering faculty. And one thing

29:43.046 --> 29:49.391
we've got to do is increase the number of graduate

29:43.046 --> 29:49.391
students. Let's discuss the Department of 
Energy. Do you think it's been successful in

29:51.153 --> 29:55.637
improving the nation's energy situation? Well, I 
don't know what you mean by successful. Are you

30:00.121 --> 30:01.863
talking about economically successful? Well, 
yeah. The Department of Energy is a very large

30:05.768 --> 30:14.740
federal agency, and any time you get a very large 
agency of any type, it's probably not very

30:05.768 --> 30:14.740
efficient. And I would say that the Department of 
Energy has not been very efficient in increasing

30:16.062 --> 30:25.234
the supply of oil and gas in the country. They 
certainly haven't been efficient in increasing

30:25.720 --> 30:31.353
the supply of oil and gas as far as increasing the 
energy supply. I think they've been spending a lot

30:31.373 --> 30:41.256
of money on sources of energy that may pay off 20 
years or 50 years from now. They haven't spent a

30:42.118 --> 30:44.083
whole lot of money on oil and gas research, which is 
needed in the short run. There hadn't been as much

30:50.230 --> 30:53.594
money spent on oil and gas research. I imagine they 
assumed that the oil companies would do the

30:53.614 --> 30:56.217
research.

31:01.243 --> 31:10.475
Do you have any figures on how much oil production 
has increased, say, since 1973 in the United

31:01.243 --> 31:10.475
States? I don't have any thing here. I can look. I 
can look those numbers up if you want me to give you

31:13.898 --> 31:17.201
some numbers. You know, what we've been trying to 
do is to, as far as if you look at the reserves of oil

31:18.922 --> 31:35.117
and gas in the country, the reserves have been 
declining for a number of years. And what we're

31:36.258 --> 31:39.741
trying to do is to get the reserves on the upswing 
again. And the only way you get reserves on the

31:39.781 --> 31:43.264
upswing is by drilling more wells. Back in the 
mid-50s, we were drilling about 55,000 wells per

31:44.273 --> 31:49.460
year. During the late 60s, we were down to, in early 
70s, we were down to about 25,000 wells per year,

31:51.222 --> 32:00.254
not even half as many as we were drilling in the 50s. 
Well, now we're back up to the range of 60 or so

32:01.035 --> 32:05.301
thousand wells per year. So I would expect to see 
the oil reserves to, to follow this same trend and

32:12.438 --> 32:17.465
for us to see an increase in the amount of oil 
reserves that we have. If you had control over

32:18.407 --> 32:26.358
public policy, what would you do to guarantee a 
large increase in oil production? What could be

32:26.378 --> 32:28.401
done to do this? Well, I think we need to have more 
tax incentives to increase, to increase

32:28.421 --> 32:40.639
exploration and increase enhanced secondary 
type recovery. You know, we currently have the

32:41.378 --> 32:47.264
windfalls profits tax, which really is not a 
profits tax. It is a direct tax off the top. It

32:50.227 --> 32:53.370
doesn't make any difference whether you're 
making a profit or making a loss. That tax still

32:53.410 --> 32:55.672
comes right off the top. If it was actually a 
profits tax, well, then that would be a real

32:56.553 --> 33:10.407
incentive for the companies to take that money and 
try to invest it to develop other resources rather

32:56.553 --> 33:10.407
than just paying it in as taxes, whereas now they 
don't have that option. They're taking really the

33:10.960 --> 33:17.987
heart of the income from the oil, and they're 
paying it to the government. Well, then that's the

33:18.007 --> 33:21.811
reason a lot of taxes have opposed that one fall. 
That's right. The name is a misnomer. It is not a

33:26.395 --> 33:28.077
profits tax. It is just a tax right off the top. So it 
is a deterrent to us becoming energy

33:32.521 --> 33:36.445
self-sufficient. It was passed by Congress as a 
way of countering public attention to so-called

33:36.914 --> 33:47.088
huge increases in oil company profits. I think 
that's right.

33:50.714 --> 33:53.217
This tax is billed as a detriment. Why is it that 
there hasn't been reports of oil companies, for

33:53.297 --> 33:59.085
instance, making the greatest profits ever here 
at this occasion? Well, what you hear is percent

33:59.646 --> 34:03.732
increase over last year. Well, that's not a very 
good way of looking at it. We may have lost $1

34:08.658 --> 34:13.943
million last year, and so we only lose $500,000 
this year. And that's a big increase. So you can't

34:17.026 --> 34:19.809
go by percent increase in profits. The oil 
companies were in a very bad financial situation

34:20.329 --> 34:25.935
before the air oil embargo. Since that time, 
they've been increasing. But you don't hear any of

34:28.317 --> 34:33.803
the reports

34:34.238 --> 34:43.614
profits on investment if we aren't saying that 
you're making 5% on your investment. In fact, if

34:43.634 --> 34:52.990
you look at the actual amount of money that the oil 
companies are making on their investment, if they

34:43.634 --> 34:52.990
took that same investment down to the savings 
alone and invested it at 15% or whatever your

34:53.189 --> 35:06.485
federal money is these days, they would probably 
make more money off of that than they're making off

34:53.189 --> 35:06.485
of their investment in the oil industry. But it's 
not reported that way. It's reported as percent

35:09.008 --> 35:11.350
increase over last year. Well, you think the 
windfall promise tax was passed for political

35:12.332 --> 35:15.535
reasons? Sure it was passed for political 
reasons. It was a way for the federal government to

35:17.498 --> 35:20.361
support the programs.

35:24.560 --> 35:41.485
I doubt

35:24.560 --> 35:41.485
it.

35:41.725 --> 35:54.364
I think

35:41.725 --> 35:54.364
the government is in a tight situation right now. 
as far as trying to balance the budget. To repeal

35:58.537 --> 36:05.025
the windfall profits tax would take away a large 
source of revenue to the federal government. I

36:05.045 --> 36:06.767
don't really expect them to do that. I think it 
should be done, but I don't really expect them to do

36:08.329 --> 36:13.136
it. What about alternate sources of energy? You 
mentioned earlier that the Department of Energy

36:15.519 --> 36:20.826
has invested a lot of money in other searches in 
this field. Do you have any personal... Any ideas

36:24.365 --> 36:29.831
personally on what other sources of fuel might be 
usable in the future? Well, I think it's the

36:29.851 --> 36:32.434
standard things that are being mentioned now. I 
think nuclear is an excellent source, and we need

36:32.474 --> 36:44.909
to get on with nuclear development and quit all the 
harassment and so forth of the companies that are

36:32.474 --> 36:44.909
trying to develop nuclear energy. It isn't a 
matter of whether we want to or don't want to. It's a

36:48.393 --> 36:49.714
matter that we've got to. So the longer we put it 
off, the more protests and the more legal

36:50.555 --> 36:59.066
confusion there is, well, the longer it's going to 
be before we actually solve our problem. What

37:00.067 --> 37:10.060
about

37:00.067 --> 37:10.060
would alcohol as a source propel cars? Well, I 
think it has a very low potential. If you look at how

37:17.318 --> 37:24.747
much energy is required to produce the alcohol 
versus how much energy you get from the alcohol. It

37:24.767 --> 37:29.093
takes almost exactly the same amount of energy to 
make it as you get from it. So you're winding up

37:30.234 --> 37:33.258
where you began. In order to make the alcohol, 
you've got to run it through a distillation. Well,

37:39.666 --> 37:42.870
the energy that's required to distill the alcohol 
It's the same amount that you get from the alcohol.

37:46.577 --> 37:48.179
That's what keeps the price so high. That's what 
keeps the price so high. If you're going to distill

37:50.102 --> 37:58.275
it using natural gas, you're going to burn up more 
natural gas to make the alcohol than the BTU

37:50.102 --> 37:58.275
content that you get from the alcohol. So why just 
not make the alcohol to begin with and use the

37:58.335 --> 38:04.464
natural gas for whatever you needed the energy 
for? How much more efficient from that standpoint

38:05.266 --> 38:10.133
is it to produce gasoline as far as energy? Oh... It 
is tremendously more efficient. I don't have

38:14.103 --> 38:34.693
those numbers, but I would estimate that

38:14.103 --> 38:34.693
you're only using maybe 25% of the energy to 
generate the gasoline that you actually get from

38:14.103 --> 38:34.693
the gasoline. Whereas with alcohol, methanol, it 
takes 100%. Now, if you can use some type of fuel

38:40.782 --> 38:57.220
like corn stalks or wood chips or something like 
that that you can't burn in a car to produce a liquid

38:40.782 --> 38:57.220
fuel that you can burn in a car, well, then you've 
accomplished something. You've traded one type

38:57.260 --> 39:01.104
of energy for a more useful type of energy. But as 
far as the energy balance itself is concerned, you

39:01.785 --> 39:06.570
wind up right where you began. So that is not going 
to solve our energy problem. What about producing

39:10.064 --> 39:16.030
energy from what's it called, shale? Shale oil. 
Shale oil. That is a potential source of oil, of

39:19.834 --> 39:24.499
energy. Here again, you're talking about a very 
expensive process. And the cost of energy that we

39:28.783 --> 39:33.688
have today, like $35 a barrel for oil, shale oil is 
doubtful as to whether it's economical at that

39:34.124 --> 39:57.364
cost. What about the current glut on the oil market 
nationwide? Do you have any response to that or

40:04.319 --> 40:07.505
reason for that being? Well, I think the primary 
reason is the

40:08.888 --> 40:20.331
conservation that has been practiced in this 
country and other countries. primarily with the

40:21.307 --> 40:28.656
automobile going from the large cars to the small 
cars, has decreased the requirements for

40:21.307 --> 40:28.656
gasoline. The producing countries have pretty 
much continued to produce at their same rate, and

40:30.138 --> 40:36.185
our consumption has been lower. Consequently, we 
get an excess of oil.

40:43.054 --> 40:48.360
What effect do you think the deregulation of oil 
has had on the current prices? I don't think it's

40:48.830 --> 40:50.492
had any effect on it. Do you think it will have any 
effect in the long run? I think it will have effect

40:53.576 --> 40:57.861
of better balancing supply and demand. Do you 
expect gasoline prices to stay the same or change

40:59.283 --> 41:03.528
over the next several years? I expect them to stay 
pretty much the same as long as we have a glut in the

41:04.229 --> 41:10.116
oil market. Here again, you're looking at the 
forces of the market, the supply and demand

41:10.136 --> 41:13.680
situation. If you've got more of a supply than you 
have a demand, well, you don't expect the prices to

41:13.740 --> 41:17.925
go up.

41:20.875 --> 41:31.825
What impact do you think that the OPEC policies 
will have on our oil supply? OPEC has a very large

41:31.845 --> 41:34.187
effect on our oil supply. I really feel like that 
OPEC, that we haven't looked at it that way, but I

41:35.048 --> 41:48.840
feel that OPEC probably did us a big favor when they 
raised the price of oil, not only for the United

41:35.048 --> 41:48.840
States but for the whole world. As long as you could 
get all the oil you wanted at $3 a barrel, you're not

41:49.816 --> 41:58.308
going to invest anything in developing new 
sources of energy. Well, oil is not going to last

41:59.349 --> 42:01.092
forever. And you don't want to run down to the 
situation where when you use up the last barrel of

42:01.993 --> 42:13.028
oil in the world and you have nothing else to take 
its place, you decide that maybe I better start

42:01.993 --> 42:13.028
working on a different source of energy. So the 
price of oil needs to be in line with the, what it's

42:19.786 --> 42:26.256
actually worth, I guess is what I'm trying to say. 
Why were the Arabians selling this oil at less than

42:26.797 --> 42:35.250
they could have gotten for all these years? They, 
I'm not sure they were selling it for less than what

42:35.270 --> 42:48.190
they could have gotten all these years because as I 
was saying a while ago, the United States had more

42:35.270 --> 42:48.190
oil capacity than they could actually produce 
back during those years when The Arabians were

42:48.457 --> 42:51.781
selling it for $3 a barrel. But it finally got to the 
situation where U.S. oil capacity started to

42:52.181 --> 43:01.072
decline, where we were dependent on them, where 
they did have control of the market. Before that,

43:01.092 --> 43:03.034
they didn't have control of the market. We had 
control of the market.

43:06.959 --> 43:14.548
Do you think this controversy over the selling of 
the AWACS planes to Saudi Arabia is tied in with oil

43:06.959 --> 43:14.548
industry, or do you think it's strictly a foreign 
policy issue? Well, I think it's a foreign policy

43:17.279 --> 43:19.162
issue.

43:22.768 --> 43:27.456
Of course, I support very strongly the U.S. 
selling AWACS to Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is a

43:27.476 --> 43:30.040
very good friend of this country.

43:32.765 --> 43:41.059
And I think if we don't sell it to the Saudis, it will 
be interpreted by them as an unfriendly act on our

43:32.765 --> 43:41.059
part, which certainly will not be in our national 
interest.

43:44.971 --> 43:50.539
Do you have any idea how much oil we're

43:44.971 --> 43:50.539
getting from Saudi Arabia? Oh, I think we're 
getting roughly half of our imports come from

43:50.559 --> 43:58.011
Saudi Arabia. A very large, substantial portion 
of our imports. Do you think the sale is rejected by

44:01.736 --> 44:05.041
the Congress? It appears it will be, and this one 
could affect our oil imports. I don't think

44:08.506 --> 44:10.129
there's any question about it. It's just one 
factor. I'm not saying it's the only factor, but

44:13.507 --> 44:20.217
Saudi Arabia has looked to the United States for 
protection. They have looked to the United States

44:20.798 --> 44:23.482
for leadership over the years. Saudi Arabia is 
very much Americanized, so to speak. I've been to

44:28.991 --> 44:34.840
Saudi Arabia for the last two years on trips, and 
they're our friends, I guess is the way I'd put it.

44:35.613 --> 44:42.120
And like I said a while ago, if we don't sell them 
these AWAC planes, we are not being their friends.

44:42.140 --> 44:44.602
We are not treating them as we should treat our 
friends. And I think we're going to have to pay the

44:45.463 --> 44:47.686
consequences. Do you think the main opposition to 
the sale of these planes is politically as a way to

44:48.266 --> 44:58.097
embarrass Reagan, or do you think it's because of 
the power of the Jewish lobby? Oh, I think it's

44:58.117 --> 45:00.439
because of the power of the Jewish lobby.

45:05.752 --> 45:13.603
Do you have any ideas on the long-range energy 
picture facing the United States in the 1980s?

45:13.623 --> 45:15.025
I don't think it's going to get a whole lot better. 
You see the current situation standing itself for

45:16.427 --> 45:21.194
a while. For a long while. Do you think the gasoline 
prices are going to remain about where they are for

45:23.577 --> 45:28.885
how much longer? It's hard to say. I think they'll 
remain this way for another couple of years

45:30.247 --> 45:34.813
anyway, unless we have something You know, if we 
have a war that breaks out in the Middle East and

45:35.232 --> 45:42.323
that supply is cut off where there isn't an oil 
glut, well, the prices can change next month. But

45:43.545 --> 45:51.939
if the world situation in the Middle East stays as 
it is right now, I would expect oil prices to stay

45:43.545 --> 45:51.939
constant for the next couple of years. You know, 
we've gone almost a year now with prices constant.

46:05.438 --> 46:06.840
Anything else you can say? I'm just about to run out 
of questions. Anything that we need to touch on? I

46:13.509 --> 46:33.117
think that the petroleum engineering curriculum 
is a very good curriculum for a young person in that

46:13.509 --> 46:33.117
he is trained how to drill wells, how to produce 
fluids from wells, how to separate those fluids,

46:33.839 --> 46:39.749
process them at the surface, ship them down 
pipelines to the consumer. He learns about fluid

46:40.731 --> 46:43.075
flow through porous media. He learns about 
geology and economics. With that background, he

46:46.881 --> 46:52.090
can be a petroleum engineer and produce oil and 
gas. He could produce groundwater just as well. He

46:57.058 --> 46:59.863
could produce geothermal energy just as well. He 
could do mineral leaching, mineral processing

47:00.502 --> 47:04.370
just as well. He could work in institute lignite 
gasification or coal gasification just as well.

47:11.586 --> 47:13.971
So it isn't a degree that is...
