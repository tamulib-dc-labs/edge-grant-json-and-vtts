WEBVTT

00:01.364 --> 00:14.096
Well, this issue first came up in about 57 or 58 in a 
discussion with a gentleman who was then vice

00:01.364 --> 00:14.096
president of Duke, but running it, because the 
president at that point didn't do much. His name

00:14.116 --> 00:16.098
was Paul M. Gross. And Paul was president of AAAS. 
He was an advisor to Eisenhower, chemist, really a

00:22.444 --> 00:27.670
sharp guy. At that time, it must have been, oh, in 
his 60s,

00:36.245 --> 00:38.548
suppress a few chuckles about it. Sitting next to 
him during that first discussion as to the

00:39.088 --> 00:50.843
possibilities of my appointment to the 
department was a man who was the provost of the

00:39.088 --> 00:50.843
university.

00:54.047 --> 00:59.293
And the provost got his degree at Duke University 
as a student of Paul Grove. And when the chairman of

01:01.476 --> 01:04.800
the department, who at that time very opposed to 
it, made a snide remark about inbreeding. I saw

01:12.171 --> 01:15.695
these two gentlemen take a little twinkle.

01:18.478 --> 01:19.680
I found it very amusing. And apparently, Paul 
didn't think of any great risk involved. The next

01:25.786 --> 01:35.277
series of questions I have to ask now have to do with 
what you conceive of the role of oceanography to be

01:25.786 --> 01:35.277
in the future. futuristic questions. Those 
questions scientists like the least to answer.

01:43.368 --> 01:56.904
First of all, as an administrator and scientist, 
what sort of topics in oceanography do you think

01:43.368 --> 01:56.904
will be the so-called hot topics of the future for 
which students to operate on? Scientifically.

01:57.645 --> 01:58.246
Scientifically. That is, if nuclear physics, for 
example, was the hot topic of the 50s for

01:58.266 --> 02:05.314
oceanographers, which... disciplines of 
oceanography are now in ascendance and which are

02:05.969 --> 02:09.054
in decline.

02:12.619 --> 02:34.592
Well, biological oceanography has always been 
pretty far down on the list, in part because of the

02:12.619 --> 02:34.592
nature of the people who work in it, and in part 
because it does not provide a direct link to

02:12.619 --> 02:34.592
economic development and the gross national 
product, which the geological crowd do. And the

02:36.597 --> 02:46.789
military have supported, say, physical 
oceanography because of their own interests,

02:36.597 --> 02:46.789
especially in the realm of the Navy, which is fine. 
That's their business.

02:51.594 --> 02:59.764
I think we have finished or are finishing what 
might be construed as a survey period. We have

03:00.324 --> 03:02.807
amassed unbelievable amounts

03:06.905 --> 03:10.749
there, but primarily what is there. And now I will 
not be at all surprised to see a greater emphasis on

03:12.311 --> 03:36.557
subdivisions

03:12.311 --> 03:36.557
of

03:12.311 --> 03:36.557
why is the animal there, what permits it to live and 
reproduce there, how did it get there in the first

03:12.311 --> 03:36.557
place, and what does it do there.

03:39.693 --> 03:52.842
to begin to look into that and then within that I'm 
sure we will see a variety of assaults or little

03:39.693 --> 03:52.842
forays out into the beyond the frontier on far more 
molecular questions as to are there common

03:53.969 --> 04:02.942
denominators among certain marine forms that 
permit them to do similar things. And this is

04:03.923 --> 04:08.150
coming from thoughts about marine fouling, for 
example. Is it possible to find a common

04:09.091 --> 04:21.529
biochemical denominator that would answer some 
of the questions of fouling and provide us with a

04:09.091 --> 04:21.529
mechanism for controlling it? For years, the Navy 
has put all sorts of money into anti-fouling

04:22.876 --> 04:29.284
paints where you dump compound A into paint. If 
that doesn't work, you try B. You don't really know

04:31.127 --> 04:34.712
why you try B, but somebody thinks it's a good idea. 
And you can do that ad nauseum at the rate at which

04:34.732 --> 04:44.424
the chemical industry is developing compounds, 
but it's a rather empirical approach which hasn't

04:34.732 --> 04:44.424
produced any really good results. So I think we 
will see more and more effort in that particular

04:44.605 --> 04:49.491
realm in looking at the regulatory mechanisms

04:53.943 --> 04:55.665
live within a particular environment? What are 
the clues that they get, like in the old problem of

04:56.947 --> 05:05.479
vertical migration and the scattering layer? 
What tells the animals to do what they do? And now

05:08.723 --> 05:15.553
you're getting into a whole interdisciplinary, 
managed team research theme. And I think if IDOE is

05:16.855 --> 05:22.262
successful, and I'm not sure how you're going to 
measure it or who will measure it, But we will see

05:23.204 --> 05:38.588
more emphasis on trying to bring together groups 
of scientists across disciplinary lines to look

05:23.204 --> 05:38.588
at some of the big problems and hopefully leaving 
the individual scientist to still do his thing.

05:39.489 --> 05:51.608
Because a lot of the real innovative, creative 
thinking is done by that guy who just sits and

05:39.489 --> 05:51.608
thinks about it for a while and comes up with an 
approach that the team would never come up with as a

05:39.489 --> 05:51.608
whole.

05:55.672 --> 05:59.458
Now, specifically, I don't know that I can say.

06:06.250 --> 06:20.194
Second, what technological breakthroughs, if 
any, do you consider instrumental in changing

06:06.250 --> 06:20.194
oceanography, or the discipline of 
oceanography, or the approach of the discipline

06:06.250 --> 06:20.194
of oceanography in the last

06:27.380 --> 06:40.155
Well, outside of biological oceanography, 
certainly things like side scanning sonar have

06:27.380 --> 06:40.155
been major breakthroughs and have given us tools 
to do things that we could never have done before.

06:43.739 --> 06:51.087
The Alvin gets us into a part of the oceans which we 
have just explored by wire before. And I will not be

06:52.249 --> 06:56.053
surprised to see a greater interest in the proper 
use of submersibles. I think that they have been

07:00.388 --> 07:07.635
considered pretty much of a toy by some people, and 
the results which have come from them leave much to

07:00.388 --> 07:07.635
be desired. But with the 200-mile limit and a 
further interest in the seabed and life in the

07:08.536 --> 07:18.586
abyssal deeps, I assume that we will go in that 
direction. And there certainly is good

07:19.527 --> 07:24.032
justification for it, if it's a program that is 
properly developed. In the realm of biological

07:25.582 --> 07:34.952
oceanography, unfortunately, I'm hard-pressed 
to point out any real major breakthrough. Now, you

07:34.992 --> 07:51.049
can look at the development of teams as a major 
breakthrough, because biologists do not

07:34.992 --> 07:51.049
normally lend themselves to big team research, 
but the Quayer group apparently have been able to

07:34.992 --> 07:51.049
do this. And the interrelationships between the 
chemists, the physicists, and the biologists in

07:51.873 --> 08:03.467
that program suggest that under the right 
conditions, with the right personalities, and

07:51.873 --> 08:03.467
the right idiosyncrasies, it can be done. And it's 
the only way to answer some of the big problems.

08:13.700 --> 08:17.164
What do you see as the role of systematics in marine 
biology? Do you see that declining or increasing?

08:23.378 --> 08:27.043
Well, in reality, I see it as declining, but it's 
unfortunate. And we will find out that we were

08:27.704 --> 08:32.229
wrong in permitting it to decline.

08:35.394 --> 08:46.328
When all is said and done, you still must know what 
you're working with, whether you're a chemist

08:35.394 --> 08:46.328
working with some organic compound or a biologist 
working with some animal. And if you cannot

08:47.049 --> 08:52.035
properly identify that, be it a chemical compound 
or an animal, Nobody else will know what you're

08:52.623 --> 08:55.447
talking about, and you won't either. So I think we 
may see, we have seen the bottom of the curve

08:56.328 --> 09:04.478
insofar as systematics is concerned. And I would 
like to think that we will begin to see renewed

09:05.079 --> 09:16.453
emphasis on systematics, perhaps with a slightly 
different twist. it'll still serve the same

09:17.598 --> 09:27.308
function, to be able to identify animals and 
relate them to the rest of the animal kingdom. And

09:29.170 --> 09:33.494
what slightly different twist do you see attached 
to it? Anything specific? Oh, people are already

09:35.316 --> 09:44.685
looking at the use of computers and other tools, 
and there's nothing really new about it. What

09:47.348 --> 09:53.256
about the impact of computer data on such things as 
physical oceanography? It has been suggested

09:54.277 --> 10:16.427
that computer data will soon eliminate that great 
age of exploration, that is, of... No, I think

09:54.277 --> 10:16.427
it'll just give us a better focus, because before 
we've been, well, like the title of the

09:54.277 --> 10:16.427
U.S.-Soviet thing, of the world's oceans, we've 
been trying to look at the whole ocean, which is

09:54.277 --> 10:16.427
ridiculous. A number of recent discoveries off 
here point out quite conclusively that there are

10:16.812 --> 10:37.184
all sorts of far more localized phenomena that 
deserve attention before we can begin to put them

10:16.812 --> 10:37.184
all together as pieces representing the dynamics 
of the oceans. It has also been suggested, too,

10:38.326 --> 10:43.815
that new 200-mile limits, new international 
pressures, may turn people back once more to the

10:43.998 --> 10:57.138
coastal shelves, the geographic entities which 
were not too popular among biologists, marine

10:43.998 --> 10:57.138
biologists and oceanographers in decades past. 
Would you agree with that? Yeah, but I would add one

10:59.481 --> 11:09.837
other motivating force, and that is politics and 
support. we saw in the middle of the 60s the

11:10.863 --> 11:21.957
beginning of a trend on the part of the Congress 
which said, in essence, you guys have gotten all

11:10.863 --> 11:21.957
this money. Now what do you do with it other than 
figure out that the oceans are deep and that

11:23.139 --> 11:29.046
there's something living at the bottom? What's 
that got to do with us? And I will not be at all

11:32.590 --> 11:38.558
surprised if we see a greater emphasis on the part 
of the funding agencies the research that has been

11:40.529 --> 11:58.908
deep ocean, moving in toward land where it has some 
connection with the real world that the

11:40.529 --> 11:58.908
congressman can understand and that may have a 
direct bearing on the country which is providing

11:40.529 --> 11:58.908
the support.

12:03.033 --> 12:04.174
And I don't object to that at all.

12:08.120 --> 12:09.522
And that was the next question. Do you think the 
return to coastal water is particularly good?

12:12.405 --> 12:23.539
Now, you said earlier in the interview that,

12:12.405 --> 12:23.539
in effect, it was coastal waters which produced 
the most of what man needs. Do you think the

12:24.240 --> 12:36.736
economic crunch, now allow me to say that, is the 
fuel crisis, the energy shortage, and the food

12:24.240 --> 12:36.736
crisis all will turn us back more to coastal waters 
and oceanography and away from deep water

12:24.240 --> 12:36.736
activity? Yeah, I just hope that it's not a 
complete turnaround, because there's still an

12:38.444 --> 12:46.112
awful lot that we need to know about deep oceans. 
And it would be a real disaster if an ultimatum were

12:46.972 --> 12:56.682
to come out tomorrow saying that, henceforth, you 
could only work within 300 meters or something.

12:57.283 --> 13:02.208
And all too frequently, this is what happens, that 
when the pendulum swings, it goes crunch. It

13:02.368 --> 13:05.751
doesn't swing just 2 thirds of the way. There are 
very definite needs in the coastal waters, and

13:06.794 --> 13:15.484
they will not be resolved if all of us are out 
looking 5,000 meters. Now, several things on

13:15.504 --> 13:19.449
which I'd like a quick opinion on from you. Mining 
the ocean floors, that is, the ocean excluding

13:21.892 --> 13:30.522
coastal waters as a source of minerals for 
mankind. Are you optimistic or not optimistic?

13:34.351 --> 13:36.014
You said excluding coastal waters. Excluding 
coastal waters. The second question is coastal

13:37.015 --> 13:39.299
waters. First excluding coastal waters, then 
coastal waters. Well, I don't know that as the

13:43.665 --> 13:57.126
technology is presently developed, we have, with 
the exception of oil, the machinery to mine the

13:43.665 --> 13:57.126
deep oceans. Now, 10 years from now, we may. But 
it's going to have to be something that is really in

14:03.022 --> 14:10.432
short supply before the economics of it will make 
it feasible. It's like mining the moon.

14:13.417 --> 14:17.542
Presumably, we can do that too if we want to, but can 
you afford anything that comes off of it? Now,

14:19.125 --> 14:22.289
coastal waters, very definitely. And to me, it's a 
matter of real concern in this state, for example.

14:28.739 --> 14:39.290
We know that sizable phosphate deposits are 
located under coastal waters, which are the

14:28.739 --> 14:39.290
property of the state of North Carolina held in 
trust for the citizens of the state.

14:42.133 --> 14:57.430
The efforts thus far toward phosphate mining in 
particular have been

14:42.133 --> 14:57.430
very, well, they have resulted in deleterious 
effects to the environment. And I'm trying to

14:58.388 --> 15:05.054
encourage the state to take the OPEC attitude 
toward phosphates under the coastal waters. That

15:05.114 --> 15:07.557
if somebody really wants it, they can pay for it. 
But it is a non-renewable resource. And that

15:11.461 --> 15:20.990
provision should be made to reimburse the 
citizens of this state and replace the estuaries

15:11.461 --> 15:20.990
that they will tear up in the process of mining. But 
nobody cares about that yet. They will.

15:27.380 --> 15:32.125
But it's quite feasible, and it's right down the 
road, there's no doubt about it. Okay. Besides

15:32.445 --> 15:38.651
phosphates and oil, which are all accurately 
named, can you think of other mineral resources

15:32.445 --> 15:38.651
which will be available off the coastal shores? 
Oh, the chances are good it's like everything

15:39.612 --> 15:41.874
else. Thus far, our efforts have been expended 
largely toward oil and phosphate. And in looking

15:49.101 --> 15:52.424
for them, we've most likely overlooked a variety 
of other things. And if we find other things, which

15:53.185 --> 15:56.728
there's no reason why we shouldn't, then again, if 
it's economically feasible and profitable,

15:57.333 --> 16:05.767
people will begin to develop the techniques to 
mine them. What about plankton and kelp? These are

16:08.792 --> 16:17.507
two words that appear frequently in the 
vocabulary of the 60s in terms of potential food

16:08.792 --> 16:17.507
sources and other valuable resources. A comment 
on those? Well, on the East Coast, of course,

16:31.353 --> 16:37.423
and will undoubtedly provide a number of things 
that will be useful, but I don't know on what scale.

16:38.325 --> 16:41.330
Plankton, directly, no. This is, well, it's a 
little too far down on the food chain to make it

16:42.191 --> 16:51.387
worthwhile in the, well, if you look at a whale,

16:59.011 --> 17:03.116
in order to pick up the plankton necessary to 
sustain it. And I would not advocate that we

17:03.136 --> 17:12.848
develop a mechanical whale to do this, because the 
energy expended in driving the whale would far

17:03.136 --> 17:12.848
exceed the return in terms of the plankton.

17:17.814 --> 17:28.427
Now, finally, do you feel as if, or in your opinion, 
let me say this, in your opinion, Has the glory

17:28.762 --> 17:31.807
years of oceanography peaked? That is, the number 
of people enrolled in schools, the number of

17:31.827 --> 17:37.677
supports going to receive from federal agencies. 
Is that a thing of the past? No, I don't think so. I

17:41.403 --> 17:44.208
think it's, like everything else in this world, 
it's a cycle. And for years, politicians and

17:46.151 --> 17:52.963
biopoliticians have been talking about the 70% of 
the Earth's globe is covered with the oceans and

17:53.905 --> 18:01.596
what it can mean to the future of civilization. And 
it's sort of a pretty well worn out phrase, but it's

18:02.538 --> 18:06.844
still true. And I think with the 200 mile limit and a 
variety of other political developments, we're

18:08.106 --> 18:22.427
going to see a long term interest in the oceans. And 
there will continue to be varying demands on

18:24.027 --> 18:32.318
numbers of oceanographers and for numbers of 
oceanographers. I think that we may have seen an

18:33.520 --> 18:43.834
end to the period of exploration for purely 
academic reasons, as we know it. But we will see

18:44.935 --> 18:48.280
more and more emphasis on utilization of the 
ocean.

18:58.030 --> 19:05.943
to me a relatively young science, one of the few 
that is truly international and has been since it

18:58.030 --> 19:05.943
was first conceived. And this, to me, will be the 
thing that will sustain it.

19:14.597 --> 19:17.622
Now, what about the picture collection? Okay. 
Gunnar Thorsen, for many years, carried with him a

19:18.103 --> 19:24.173
movie camera. And any place he was in a group of more 
than three scientists, he proceeded to take a

19:25.874 --> 19:36.027
30-second shot of individuals in the group. And he 
left his widow a sizable collection of film that

19:38.030 --> 19:48.523
involves big names in the realm of European

19:57.025 --> 19:59.108
and others who are oceanographers. It would 
include a lot of oceanographers. And that film, to

20:02.534 --> 20:05.037
my knowledge, just sits. I wrote her and asked her 
if there were any plans for any kind of editing and,

20:06.480 --> 20:21.463
you know, the release of some sort of a 30-minute 
film of oceanographers or something. She said she

20:21.865 --> 20:26.850
had turned it over, I think, to the University of 
Copenhagen and kept a copy for herself. But it

20:27.911 --> 20:50.151
would be a shame to let something like that just sit 
when a group like yours might be able to get a copy of

20:27.911 --> 20:50.151
it and develop it with a little technical 
assistance, perhaps, into a really good

20:27.911 --> 20:50.151
documentary film of trends in oceanography since 
World War II or something like that. Because it

20:52.392 --> 20:54.394
would include a lot of people who are now gone. It 
surely would. Including Gunnar himself. I assume

20:58.539 --> 20:59.500
he's on there. I don't know how he did his own 
picture. But there are a good number of people, of

21:02.943 --> 21:07.688
course, very important oceanography have died in 
the last four years. And he covered the globe more

21:07.969 --> 21:11.472
than any other man for his time. He was involved in 
the development of the Thai-Danish cooperative

21:12.173 --> 21:16.778
program. He was down there talking about the Suez 
Canal and a cooperative study of the Suez Canal

21:16.798 --> 21:22.264
between all sorts of people years ago. I mean, it 
was amazing what that guy did with a lot of help from

21:26.094 --> 21:36.404
people like F.G. Walton and Hilary Moore and Kenna 
and all over the place. But if you ever get an

21:38.386 --> 21:44.932
interest in it, let me know, because I knew her, 
still do, reasonably well. And I could serve as a

21:45.573 --> 21:49.116
catalyst on that front. I think I'm going to talk to 
Cal Houn about that. Nothing else. Copies of that

21:52.602 --> 22:02.731
film ought to be placed in archives like Duke or 
Texas A&M or someplace so I can afford to put it so

21:52.602 --> 22:02.731
that it would be here in this country available 
later on in the future. Well, do you have anything

22:03.272 --> 22:04.813
else you'd like to say? Any comments you'd like to 
make in oceanography and about oceanography in

22:05.874 --> 22:12.220
general or anything in particular? Well, one 
thing you didn't touch on, which I'm sure you're

22:12.240 --> 22:21.529
aware of, but relatively speaking, the 
oceanographic community is very small. And I'm

22:22.505 --> 22:31.453
convinced that this, coupled with the 
international aspects of it, have contributed to

22:22.505 --> 22:31.453
what little success we may be able to point to. 
Because if I drop down in the middle of Hamburg

22:32.354 --> 22:49.309
tomorrow, I will meet people I know, who know 
people I know, who have worked with other people

22:32.354 --> 22:49.309
that I know, and who know me and so forth. And it's 
really amazing. at even one of the big

22:51.833 --> 23:01.491
oceanographic conferences, how relatively 
small the number is and how intertwined it all is.

23:03.114 --> 23:12.070
Now, of course, it breaks pretty much into 
physical, geological, chemical, and

23:03.114 --> 23:12.070
biological.

23:25.803 --> 23:26.804
and vice versa. The geological oceanographers 
somehow tend to be a little more communicative, in

23:27.445 --> 23:35.273
part, I think, because they have mutual needs. 
Chemists, some. But if you go to a meeting of ASZ,

23:40.018 --> 23:54.274
there are far more people and far less 
communication than you have with limnology and

23:40.018 --> 23:54.274
oceanography, say, or ASO. And at some point, it 
would be interesting just for fun, I think, to see

23:56.633 --> 24:13.735
if there is any kind of a relationship between 
numbers and

23:56.633 --> 24:13.735
the communication that we enjoy within the 
oceanographic community. I know some of the early

24:15.878 --> 24:22.807
relationships between the Soviets and the US were 
purely coincidence. A US ship would stop at Dakar.

24:30.485 --> 24:37.655
before Big Brother could realize what was going 
on, the two communities had gotten together in a

24:30.485 --> 24:37.655
pub someplace and were having a drink. And they 
were exchanging all sorts of scientific

24:37.675 --> 24:45.867
information and agreeing, OK, now next month 
we're going to be in some place. We'll see you then.

24:46.869 --> 24:53.198
And a lot of the things that started early in the 
game between the Soviet Union and the United

24:46.869 --> 24:53.198
States started that way. And it wouldn't have been 
possible if it hadn't been for the international

24:59.020 --> 25:05.148
nature and spread of facilities such as ships.

25:05.168 --> 25:06.670
No, I wasn't aware of that at all. And people like 
Howie Sanders, Woods Hole, knew and talked with

25:07.371 --> 25:21.368
Soviet scientists long before the government 
ever considered that such a thing might be a good

25:07.371 --> 25:21.368
idea. And it goes on all the time.

25:27.134 --> 25:33.800
And now, of course, it's loosely accepted, at 
least by their government. But in the old days, it

25:33.961 --> 25:40.527
wasn't, and it happened in spite of them.

25:40.547 --> 25:51.017
Which I guess, if you want to take it back into its 
historical days, is the same sort of thing that has

25:40.547 --> 25:51.017
happened traditionally in the seafaring 
communities. Apprentices would sneak out of a

25:51.097 --> 25:54.981
country by ship someplace and take their 
knowledge of the silver trade over to another

25:55.788 --> 26:08.502
country and seafaring men would pull into a dock 
and pick up the latest news of revolution and take

25:55.788 --> 26:08.502
it home. The same sort of thing. It's a real loose 
crowd. It's a pretty independent crowd. It's a

26:15.629 --> 26:20.074
pretty

26:15.629 --> 26:20.074
self-starting crowd.

26:30.061 --> 26:36.127
And it's something about the sea, I think, that 
encourages this. Now, of course, your discussion

26:36.147 --> 26:52.604
today denied this, but my impression certainly 
was that a growing specialization among

26:36.147 --> 26:52.604
oceanographers was tending to break up this 
community. Well, I don't see it. But maybe it's

26:55.126 --> 27:00.051
because I'm not as much one of the Well,

27:00.267 --> 27:12.383
I don't consider myself to be on the in-group of the 
big oceanographic institutions, and it doesn't

27:00.267 --> 27:12.383
bother me any. But it may well be that if you were to 
talk to people like Paul Fein, Woods Hole, Art

27:13.985 --> 27:29.346
Maxwell, and that crap, who are the kingpins of 
oceanography in a big sense, yeah, they may see it

27:13.985 --> 27:29.346
that way. But I'm sort of standing on the periphery 
looking at it from a far more overview standpoint

27:30.963 --> 27:42.461
than I would expect they would be.

27:42.481 --> 27:51.536
Well, one of the attractions of oceanography was, 
and then one of the international attractions

27:42.481 --> 27:51.536
too, was that oceanographers were an academic 
discipline, had to have advice from other people.

27:51.576 --> 27:51.756
Right.

27:55.415 --> 28:00.661
Because with a common ground in the ocean, they had 
to know somebody who could do chemistry. Even

28:00.681 --> 28:05.587
though they might know what chemistry was about, 
they couldn't do it if they were going to get any

28:00.681 --> 28:05.587
help. And I think you get constant injections of 
new ideas this way. You don't get into a rut. And if

28:13.437 --> 28:16.681
the day comes when we do, then we're really in 
trouble. But I think there are enough young,

28:18.683 --> 28:25.371
independent, on occasion abrasive, scientists 
who will not let that happen, and their day will

28:26.110 --> 28:30.214
come soon.
