WEBVTT

00:01.297 --> 00:06.585
We're concerned with the production of the final 
product and its marketing. This has been a rather

00:07.767 --> 00:27.338
successful strategy because we're working with 
the producers and with the large volume

00:07.767 --> 00:27.338
processors who see us as friends and we're not 
competing with the grocery products companies

00:28.381 --> 00:38.410
who would otherwise see us as their competitors if 
we were developing final products for the

00:28.381 --> 00:38.410
marketplace.

00:41.112 --> 00:57.527
More recently, we have taken a look at our program 
and decided that we really were in the extraction

00:41.112 --> 00:57.527
or separation processes business, although we 
currently have about $1 million a year research

00:57.777 --> 01:11.892
budget, and most of it is spent on

00:57.777 --> 01:11.892
oilseed processing. We recognize that the 
techniques that we use are applicable to

01:13.994 --> 01:25.506
processing of other crops, other non-edible 
crops.

01:26.330 --> 01:33.861
Early this spring, we established a new section in 
the Food Protein Research and Development

01:26.330 --> 01:33.861
Center. It's called the Separation Processes 
Laboratory. The objective there is to

01:37.927 --> 01:52.067
concentrate on the science and engineering of 
separation and to also work on other applications

01:37.927 --> 01:52.067
such as industrial crops. Within the last five 
years, there's been increasing interest in the

01:53.093 --> 01:59.783
replenishable resources. This means the growing 
of crops to replace

02:00.524 --> 02:14.704
fossil energy and hydrocarbon sources. In other 
words, growing of our own liquid fuels,

02:15.385 --> 02:21.193
lubricating oils. her own chemical feedstocks 
rather than relying on drilled petroleum or

02:22.591 --> 02:32.981
mined coal. We feel that this work will continue, 
although there certainly will be a strong

02:35.444 --> 02:47.055
petroleum industry and perhaps even a stronger 
coal industry in the future. And thus we have

02:48.377 --> 02:52.581
ventured into the separation processes area and 
have done and are doing some work with

02:53.270 --> 03:00.400
agricultural crops that are non-edible. We have 
worked with jojoba, J-O-J-O-B-A, which is an arid

03:01.001 --> 03:12.176
lands crop. It produces a oil. Well, it's a 
perennial bush that has seeds or nuts,

03:22.767 --> 03:33.096
which when crushed produce an oil that is very 
similar to whale oil. Rather than being composed

03:33.777 --> 03:40.923
of triglycerides, it's composed of aliphatic 
esters. That means you have straight chain rather

03:41.643 --> 03:51.492
than branch type of fat

03:41.643 --> 03:51.492
in jojoba oil. As such, it is a highly stable

03:51.927 --> 04:18.089
oil and is used in high pressure lubrication 
applications such as jet aircraft, automatic

03:51.927 --> 04:18.089
transmissions,

03:51.927 --> 04:18.089
permanent lubricated type of motors, equipment, 
things of this nature. We're also currently

04:20.491 --> 04:21.512
working on extraction of latex or rubber from 
Guayule, that's spelled G-U-A-Y-U-L-E.

04:35.199 --> 04:47.635
This is another shrub that grows along the 
U.S.-Mexico border in the arid lands region from,

04:35.199 --> 04:47.635
say, the Big Bend west

04:48.273 --> 04:52.440
through to California. The

04:53.141 --> 05:09.687
shrub contains a latex which, when extracted, is 
very similar to natural

04:53.141 --> 05:09.687
rubber from Havilla. That's H-A-V-E-A. or the 
rubber tree that is cultivated in the Dutch East

05:11.797 --> 05:18.664
Indies and in Central Africa. Many people don't 
realize that after petroleum, our next largest

05:19.965 --> 05:32.697
import in terms of dollars is rubber in the United 
States. And we can no longer, as a nation, rely on

05:38.830 --> 05:46.582
the rubber producing areas staying within the 
free world group of countries. Certainly our

05:47.443 --> 05:58.240
experiences in Vietnam have shown this as well as 
the various revolutions and coups in Africa. In

05:59.702 --> 06:07.133
case of a

05:59.702 --> 06:07.133
war or even a period of political hardening, the 
United States would be in a very vulnerable

06:08.277 --> 06:25.113
position if it lost its supply of rubber and could 
no longer import

06:08.277 --> 06:25.113
it. Synthetic rubber is

06:25.374 --> 06:33.461
very important to our economy, but it will not 
replace natural rubber.

06:36.404 --> 06:38.166
Fairly large amounts of natural rubber are 
required for high performance applications such

06:39.108 --> 06:55.028
as military aircraft, tires, engine mounts, tank 
treads, and this

06:39.108 --> 06:55.028
type of application. Also, as the U.S. has gone 
from larger to smaller cars and to radial tires,

06:55.189 --> 07:05.622
the average natural rubber content to the tire has 
had to increase because of the higher performance

07:06.277 --> 07:12.346
requirements.

07:16.171 --> 07:35.980
Synthetic rubber just will not substitute 
completely for natural rubber, and there is need

07:16.171 --> 07:35.980
for developing a better solution to our

07:16.171 --> 07:35.980
national rubber needs.

07:37.377 --> 07:47.390
We are working on developing processes for 
extracting this latex from the Wai'uli bush.

07:48.392 --> 08:04.954
Unlike the avia, a rubber tree which grows large 
and can be slashed and then the rubber or latex bled

07:48.392 --> 08:04.954
into a container, the Wai'uli bush at say three to 
five years, which would be normal harvest time,

08:05.153 --> 08:15.282
would be only two and a half to four feet tall. And 
there's no way to slash and bleed them. You really

08:21.288 --> 08:33.979
have got to either polarize them, that means cut 
the top branches off, or else dig up the whole

08:21.288 --> 08:33.979
plant, and then it has to be

08:39.292 --> 08:52.245
ground, shredded to release

08:39.292 --> 08:52.245
the latex through one of several processes.

08:54.708 --> 09:05.219
We feel that there's going to be additional 
industrial products interest in the country as

08:54.708 --> 09:05.219
time goes by. And this is why we have established a 
separation processes laboratory. Getting back

09:09.987 --> 09:39.994
to the oilseeds processing area, in recent years 
we have taken the position that our main role is to

09:09.987 --> 09:39.994
improve the profitability of oilseeds 
production and processing for the Texas farmer

09:09.987 --> 09:39.994
and processor and the U.S. producer and 
processor. As such, we have

09:41.442 --> 10:09.272
broadened our base to include various concerns

09:41.442 --> 10:09.272
such as energy conservation, dust control,

09:41.442 --> 10:09.272
development of usable and really available 
solvents, improving extraction efficiency, and

10:09.758 --> 10:21.732
also improving the feed value of the byproducts. 
For a while, the emphasis at the center, this was

10:23.534 --> 10:38.652
during the 70s, was on developing low-cost, 
developing sources and processes for low-cost

10:23.534 --> 10:38.652
food proteins However, we have found that the U.S. 
being an exporter of food products is far from

10:40.387 --> 11:05.196
being on a vegetable protein economy, and even

10:40.387 --> 11:05.196
the developing countries aren't quite ready to 
use some of these vegetable proteins that have

10:40.387 --> 11:05.196
been developed. So the emphasis has 
intentionally shifted to improve the

11:05.581 --> 11:14.935
productivity and profitability of the local 
processing industry. What are some of the methods

11:15.756 --> 11:18.901
that your research program is funded by? You 
mentioned that you had a budget of about a million

11:18.921 --> 11:23.187
dollars a year.

11:26.592 --> 11:33.242
We receive about 12% to 15% of our funding through 
the engineering experiment station. This is

11:34.015 --> 11:48.432
primarily to be used as seed money, program 
development money, holdover money, say, when our

11:34.015 --> 11:48.432
people are working between various projects. 
About 40% of our

11:49.493 --> 11:57.742
funding comes through the Natural Fibers and Food 
Coordination Commission of Texas. It's a group

11:59.524 --> 12:02.588
that is separately funded by the state 
legislature and its objective is to develop

12:03.040 --> 12:20.787
new uses and expand the uses of Texas grown crops as 
well as assist in the development of the

12:03.040 --> 12:20.787
processing industry for them.

12:24.754 --> 12:28.980
We then have about 20% of our funding from federal 
competitive type of grants and the balance about

12:29.973 --> 12:39.725
25% from industry programs. We have two industry 
programs. One is the contract research program

12:42.128 --> 12:46.714
where we do contract research for firms. The other 
is a industry services program where we make our

12:46.774 --> 12:58.208
pilot plant available to, our pilot plant 
equipment and train operators available to

12:58.846 --> 13:11.224
companies who want to come in and

12:58.846 --> 13:11.224
try various combinations of equipment for 
developing new processes. As I see it, the area

13:12.425 --> 13:24.142
that is most likely to grow will be that of the 
industry services and the industry research

13:12.425 --> 13:24.142
programs. I expect that the state Originated 
funds will probably grow

13:29.997 --> 13:43.209
with

13:29.997 --> 13:43.209
inflation, which really means no actual 
increase. And the federal programs will probably

13:44.690 --> 13:56.601
be held rather in tight reign by the current and 
subsequent administrations. So really our

13:57.041 --> 13:58.182
future, It depends on our ability to recruit

13:59.275 --> 14:08.165
research work directly from industry. We've been 
fairly successful in doing this. What are some of

14:11.189 --> 14:19.538
the industries that have hired your researchers 
to do projects for them?

14:24.404 --> 14:26.987
We've had various groups come in. want to try our 
extraction equipment, for example, on various

14:27.642 --> 14:41.781
items, including spices, nuts, rather unusual 
items.

14:44.544 --> 14:55.759
We have had a program recently from Shell Oil 
Company, who would like to develop a market for a

14:44.544 --> 14:55.759
new type of solvent to replace hexane. They're 
working in isopropyl alcohol, and they're

14:55.958 --> 15:07.831
working in conjunction with Anderson Clayton 
Company, who is probably the single largest

14:55.958 --> 15:07.831
processor of cottonseed in the country. They also 
have soybean interests. We have developed

15:12.036 --> 15:24.109
various procedures for utilizing

15:12.036 --> 15:24.109
isopropanol. We also have done contract research 
for to improve the recovery of oil.

15:40.423 --> 15:43.026
Our program is of an international type. Well, 
let's say a national and international type.

15:47.171 --> 15:53.860
Originally, when the oil varieties of sunflower 
were brought back to the United States from

15:47.171 --> 15:53.860
Russia, You have to remember that sunflower is an 
American crop first, but it's a short-season

15:54.835 --> 16:01.343
crop. Where does it grow mainly? Well, currently 
the cultivated varieties grow mainly in the

16:04.207 --> 16:13.238
tri-state area of North and South Dakota and 
Minnesota. Originally it was a wild plant that

16:13.258 --> 16:20.927
grew in the Midwestern states. The plant is a 
short-season crop and very attractive to

16:21.481 --> 16:27.989
countries that have short growing seasons. This 
is why the Russians picked it up in the late 1800s,

16:28.009 --> 16:39.103
and they put quite a bit of effort into improving 
its genetics and productivity. In time, they

16:39.904 --> 16:44.390
developed varieties that were very high in oil 
content. What they did was they were able to

16:44.430 --> 16:50.357
decrease the thickness of the hull. Therefore, 
the head would have more seed and produce more oil

16:50.843 --> 16:58.892
per acre. When these varieties were brought back 
to the US in the early 1960s, the work on their

17:01.415 --> 17:16.832
growing and processing was initially done here at 
Texas A&M. Much of the processing work in this

17:17.954 --> 17:20.817
department, not exclusively, We have still 
continued to have an interest in sunflower

17:21.843 --> 17:33.621
processing and are probably the most, well, we are 
the most active U.S. group, even though the

17:21.843 --> 17:33.621
industry has gone north. Over the years, it's 
become apparent that cotton is much more

17:34.622 --> 17:42.574
profitable in Texas than sunflower. However, the 
northern states have found that sunflower is more

17:42.835 --> 17:49.605
profitable than their alternative crops, wheat, 
and barley and oats.

17:55.996 --> 18:18.765
Recently the U.S. has, recently plants, oil seed 
processing plants, sunflower plants have been

17:55.996 --> 18:18.765
built in the northern states, but the engineering 
companies in getting the processing

17:55.996 --> 18:18.765
information, particularly the hulling 
information on seed hulling, have used our

18:19.015 --> 18:27.244
facilities to check out the applicability of 
cotton seed haulers.

18:31.027 --> 18:47.925
We are currently doing some work on cotton seed 
processing for an engineering company that

18:31.027 --> 18:47.925
operates out of Paris, France.

18:49.559 --> 19:07.283
Black Nations of Africa, which were under French 
control as colonies, later re-invited the French

18:49.559 --> 19:07.283
back to work with them in developing their 
businesses. This particular company is very

19:08.144 --> 19:17.777
active in cocoa and coffee.

19:19.748 --> 19:32.448
trading, export, and also processing, and has 
asked us to work with him on extraction of various

19:19.748 --> 19:32.448
fractions from these crops. Another area that we 
are getting into that I might mention, it's a good

19:33.850 --> 19:46.110
example of how when you look upon your business as 
being function rather than commodity oriented,

19:46.816 --> 19:50.901
you immediately recognize other applications. 
We currently are applying

19:51.862 --> 20:10.364
reverse osmosis membranes to processing of

19:51.862 --> 20:10.364
stripped beer from alcohol fermentation. 
There's been quite an active program here at A&M

20:16.870 --> 20:22.596
developing

20:16.870 --> 20:22.596
gasohol production techniques. Agriculture 
engineering has led the program. They have a small

20:26.040 --> 20:33.167
alcohol fermentation plant in the shops next 
door. Eventually, they mix the alcohol, about 10%

20:34.529 --> 20:40.175
alcohol, with gas things to produce gasohol.

20:43.519 --> 20:46.742
But when one

20:49.439 --> 21:03.554
ferments sorghum or corn into alcohol, it's 
necessary to run this process at rather dilute

20:49.439 --> 21:03.554
concentrations. The beer, which is the fermented 
liquid, at the end of the process is run through

21:05.577 --> 21:16.228
distillation columns, and the alcohol is 
distilled off. However, the remaining beer, or

21:18.852 --> 21:25.763
spent worth, as you call it,

21:18.852 --> 21:25.763
presents certain problems. First of all, it's too 
dilute

21:25.803 --> 21:30.870
for animal feeding. Some of it can be consumed by 
animals, but you really would bloat the cows

21:31.151 --> 21:40.024
pretty badly if you expected them to get all the 
nutrition from it. And, of course, it presents

21:40.625 --> 21:43.830
disposal problems. If one were to dehydrate it, 
for example, or dry it, the energy required would

21:44.249 --> 21:57.205
far exceed that gained by producing alcohol. So we 
are using reverse osmosis as a means of recovering

21:57.405 --> 22:09.860
the water and concentrating the soluble so that 
they can be used as feed. And there are many other

22:09.880 --> 22:11.742
applications we can point to. As far as the future 
is concerned, I think that we'll be working more

22:14.382 --> 22:31.180
broadly with other agricultural crops and also 
with extraction processes per se.

22:35.285 --> 22:40.851
The extraction processes including milling, 
separation, cleaning, have neglected for a very

22:41.489 --> 22:43.752
long time. And

22:43.872 --> 22:59.129
in many cases, we are limited in our food and 
industrial applications by the purity of the

22:43.872 --> 22:59.129
materials we have. We feel that we can make quite a 
contribution in

23:00.270 --> 23:11.243
developing more usable ingredients from 
agricultural crops. Do you think there's any

23:13.450 --> 23:17.154
certain food that would be the food of the future as 
far as protein?

23:24.001 --> 23:38.316
Not one certain food, but I think that we're going 
to have to be more efficient, more economic, so to

23:24.001 --> 23:38.316
speak, about using the available calories and 
proteins. Really, that's all that. that we have to

23:44.129 --> 23:45.531
work with. As the world's population density 
increases, we're going to have to use every

23:46.813 --> 23:58.169
technique possible to raise enough food. This, in 
some cases, means expanding

23:58.770 --> 24:11.908
the grazing lands

23:58.770 --> 24:11.908
in some countries because When you have a very 
sparse vegetation,

24:12.547 --> 24:27.612
cows, and especially the smaller animals like 
sheep and goats, can still harvest some type of

24:12.547 --> 24:27.612
food from the land. They can harvest and 
concentrate it, so the man then can, of course, use

24:28.935 --> 24:33.843
the meat.

24:37.209 --> 24:38.571
I think there's going to be a general, trend 
towards more use of vegetable food proteins

24:39.918 --> 24:47.049
directly rather than by recycling them through 
animals. By no means do I mean that we're going to do

24:48.151 --> 25:07.242
without animals, because when you

24:48.151 --> 25:07.242
process oilseeds or cereals directly into human 
food products, you very often have as much as 50%

25:08.065 --> 25:12.089
byproducts. And the only way to get the nutrients 
out of these materials is by recycling them

25:12.749 --> 25:19.095
through animals. Animals really are sort of a very 
useful biological machine. They will

25:24.980 --> 25:37.971
concentrate the

25:24.980 --> 25:37.971
protein as well as the available calories more 
efficiently than some of the machines that that we

25:38.558 --> 25:39.459
know how to build. Of course, when you have a prime 
grain or an oil seed, say like a soybean or wheat,

25:41.261 --> 26:02.488
animals are relatively inefficient in that their 
conversion rate

25:41.261 --> 26:02.488
is relatively low. It takes about four or five 
pounds protein to put a powder protein on an

26:06.149 --> 26:09.093
animal, for example.

26:11.776 --> 26:26.715
But where your only choice is residues from 
processing or grazing land, I think animals are

26:11.776 --> 26:26.715
very efficient and they'll stay. We'll probably 
be seeing even more ruminants as time goes by, and

26:31.816 --> 26:40.728
probably less of those animals that compete 
directly with man, such as swine and poultry. Of

26:41.809 --> 26:43.271
course, it depends upon where you are. Here in the 
United States, we will, I'm sure, stay on an animal

26:44.693 --> 26:56.809
protein economy for many years. Other countries, 
have enough problems feeding themselves right

27:01.010 --> 27:15.724
now, including getting enough money to import our 
crops just to stay alive on a vegetable protein

27:01.010 --> 27:15.724
diet. Do you have any figures on what percent of the 
people in this country are not getting enough

27:16.284 --> 27:22.050
protein in their diet? Not just off the top of my 
head.

27:32.667 --> 27:37.153
Actually, protein is relatively inexpensive. I 
think that where people are not getting enough

27:38.074 --> 27:48.409
protein or calories, it's a matter of education 
and appreciation. We are not protein deficient as

27:49.009 --> 27:54.417
a nation. Are some nations protein deficient? The 
countries that have high... birth rates and where

28:02.047 --> 28:24.426
say the

28:02.047 --> 28:24.426
where advances are being made in medical science 
and people continue to live and continue to live on

28:02.047 --> 28:24.426
for a long time they are squeezed from both ends yes 
yes I'd say that you can almost draw draw a band

28:25.958 --> 28:31.884
around the world, around the equator, and you'll 
find many of the countries there being protein

28:25.958 --> 28:31.884
deficient.

28:34.526 --> 28:39.511
That is because there just isn't enough protein to 
raise, to go around for the people. Actually,

28:41.393 --> 28:50.061
there is more than enough protein in the world. 
Many of the problems are those of concentrating it

28:55.237 --> 28:56.979
away from, say, the fiber. And then, of course, we 
have the problem of distribution and the

28:58.141 --> 29:04.850
economics that go along with it. In the United 
States, for example, we raise enough protein to

29:05.791 --> 29:15.965
feed about 1.5 to 2 billion people. Of course, 
we're a relatively small country. I don't know

29:19.930 --> 29:20.931
what we have. 230 million. 230 million, but I think 
only 12% or 15% of the world's land mass. Maybe not

29:30.724 --> 29:31.845
even that much. Less than that. Less than that, 
maybe 8%. So if we can grow that much protein,

29:37.892 --> 29:42.837
certainly protein is not scarce. The problem is 
one of getting the protein to people. As I was

29:47.422 --> 29:52.007
alluding to earlier, When it comes to nutrition, 
there are only two basic things that man must rely

29:52.257 --> 30:05.433
on the environment for. One is the calories. He 
can't make them because he needs the calories for

30:08.097 --> 30:12.903
his energy. The other is certain amino acids. And 
these are, they're limited to amino acids, and

30:17.738 --> 30:24.588
only plants can make some of them. And whether man 
eats the plants directly or whether he eats an

30:24.608 --> 30:40.169
animal, eats the plants, we come into a cycle where 
only these essential amino acids can be produced

30:24.608 --> 30:40.169
by plants. And the question is how to get it to man, 
whether you get it to him directly or or recycle it

30:44.806 --> 30:47.449
and concentrate it, say, through animals. Is 
there anything you'd like to say in closing?

30:54.879 --> 31:02.809
No, I think that I'm pretty optimistic as far as 
both the center and food science is concerned. I

31:03.991 --> 31:14.745
think the golden years are ahead of us really in 
terms of contributions that we'll be able to make

31:03.991 --> 31:14.745
both to the state of Texas and to the to the world. 
We're starting this fall a series of practical

31:17.339 --> 31:25.190
short courses in oil mill operations. It's our 
first venture into the technical training area.

31:33.962 --> 31:43.855
There seems to be quite a built up demand and many 
industry leaders have encouraged us to go into

31:33.962 --> 31:43.855
this field. I think we can serve a very useful 
purpose both in Texas and the U.S. and in the world.

31:56.812 --> 31:59.397
Thank you very much for talking with me tonight, 
Dr. Lewis.
