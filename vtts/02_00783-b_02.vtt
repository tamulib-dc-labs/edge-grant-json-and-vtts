WEBVTT

00:03.727 --> 00:07.000
And I won't name the specific organization. But 
they have been given money, and a portion of that

00:07.021 --> 00:11.037
money to John,

00:12.603 --> 00:33.372
but really

00:12.603 --> 00:33.372
not to

00:12.603 --> 00:33.372
John, but to John's operation that he has a little 
outfit over there, which is really for the

00:12.603 --> 00:33.372
secondary high school students, called Defense 
Studies. And so, really, the money is really for

00:33.392 --> 00:37.378
his office costs, and the cost of Kathy Brown, and 
so on. John came

00:37.780 --> 00:49.906
to the States,

00:37.780 --> 00:49.906
and this was in 79, I guess. It was after the Senate 
had been formed and was in operation, and we were

00:49.926 --> 00:51.710
office members. Brian was. And he...

00:57.457 --> 01:12.979
I went down

00:57.457 --> 01:12.979
to the Houston department. We had a British army 
colonel

01:12.999 --> 01:18.927
who was also a research associate. John got off the 
airplane, and although I had met him a couple of

01:18.947 --> 01:22.232
times before, I didn't know him all that well, but 
he was playing.

01:25.317 --> 01:42.702
And

01:25.317 --> 01:42.702
Cole Hensley told me as we came out of the airport, 
got inside, and told me that John had discovered

01:25.317 --> 01:42.702
that this outfit in Washington had put his

01:43.238 --> 02:07.413
name

01:43.238 --> 02:07.413
and resume on a proposal to the O.D. without his 
approval. That, in John's parlance, is just

02:07.874 --> 02:09.756
totally dishonest. So, on the way, on the way home 
from Houston to Clarkville, John was sitting up

02:09.776 --> 02:12.300
front with me, and it comes to the second lap. And

02:13.681 --> 02:35.108
John, of course, he's just a geek. He's an

02:35.128 --> 02:39.914
avid conversationalist, and his mind is so 
active, it just leaps ahead. It wears me out to talk

02:39.934 --> 02:40.595
with him. But uncharacteristically, in this, all 
the way up here, he would talk animatedly for a

02:40.615 --> 02:43.198
while, and then he'd lapse into a silence. And he

02:44.950 --> 02:57.187
was obviously there. And he turned around to 
Colonel Hemsworth and said, John,

02:57.207 --> 03:07.722
I am really upset about that. Talking about it. And 
that must have happened 60 times, I guess. Oh, he

03:10.466 --> 03:11.648
was just a slacker. And so he came to Texas A&M. He 
had breakfast with Colonel Hemsworth. Well,

03:15.545 --> 03:34.454
in short, he had never seen

03:15.545 --> 03:34.454
a university like Texas. And, of course, we, and 
being a military historian, he was obviously

03:34.474 --> 03:37.418
appreciative of the fact that it was a different 
institution than it had been. I don't really know

03:39.355 --> 03:53.139
what he saw

03:39.355 --> 03:53.139
in the center, because we were very ill-formed at 
that time. And I think that might have been

03:54.141 --> 04:02.676
attractive to him, because I think he feels and 
felt and feels very keenly about the need to train

03:54.141 --> 04:02.676
bright young people to do so. And of course, he has 
his own standards and his own methodology for

04:02.696 --> 04:04.519
doing that. And so I think he saw here a chance to 
help shape something that would fit the way he

04:05.393 --> 04:13.601
thinks. It turns out that the philosophy

04:14.202 --> 04:24.572
that we have and that he has are very similar. And I 
guess we probably ought to be more charitable and

04:24.592 --> 04:30.338
say that John's John's view as a real genuine 
Soviet expert has colored

04:31.060 --> 04:45.711
my view of how Soviet studies ought to be done. 
There's no question about it. And so, yeah, I think

04:46.333 --> 04:51.263
we have at least in part been shaped

04:46.333 --> 04:51.263
by John. So he, so then he went back, on his way back 
through

04:52.357 --> 05:09.727
Washington, he walked to Illinois, and he said, I 
want to work for the T.V. in Illinois. He said, I

05:10.007 --> 05:10.769
want to work for Texas A&M. Well, it was a, it was an 
incredible coup for us, you see. He was a guy with a

05:11.991 --> 05:14.415
well-established reputation, and so he worked. 
And

05:14.918 --> 05:37.329
all of a sudden, all of his publications that he, 
that he publishes in the United States came to us.

05:37.349 --> 05:38.871
So, going on the Center for Strategic Technology 
with John Erickson. And so, we were able to ride

05:38.891 --> 05:40.514
John's coat tables into the Soviet research 
group. And, now I don't, I should add, it has not, it

05:40.534 --> 05:42.276
has been a somewhat stormy relationship John does

05:43.403 --> 06:04.751
not

05:43.403 --> 06:04.751
know the meaning of the word deadline.

06:04.771 --> 06:07.274
The only time he worries about money is when he 
doesn't have any. He's eccentric, difficult to

06:07.294 --> 06:08.736
get along with. And so it's been a turbulent 
relationship. John's reputation, although he

06:10.808 --> 06:31.669
has

06:10.808 --> 06:31.669
a reputation as a tremendous scholar, there are 
other aspects of his

06:10.808 --> 06:31.669
reputation that are not good. He is well known for 
committing himself to go to a conference to

06:31.689 --> 06:34.932
present a paper. I'm not sure of that. For making 
commitments, and in defense of John, he will not

06:35.633 --> 06:38.436
say no. And he and I now

06:38.821 --> 06:59.792
have become close

06:38.821 --> 06:59.792
enough friends where I can chastise him and say, 
John, God damn it, you must learn to say no. It's

06:59.812 --> 07:01.294
unfair for you to tell people you'll do something 
and then not do it. Quite, quite. You're right,

07:01.594 --> 07:01.975
Dick. And of course, it just... One thing's 
hitting one ear and out the other. And... But, you

07:04.657 --> 07:24.571
know, looking at the relationship on balance,

07:04.657 --> 07:24.571
I think it has been a very positive

07:04.657 --> 07:24.571
relationship for us. But there have been some 
sponsors that because John has promised to

07:24.591 --> 07:28.217
deliver and hasn't, that we get, you know, to some 
extent we get tarred with that rush too. So while it

07:29.463 --> 07:51.426
hasn't

07:29.463 --> 07:51.426
been a totally positive

07:29.463 --> 07:51.426
relationship, I think it's all very positive.

07:51.446 --> 07:52.787
But he'll be here, hopefully, the setting's 
coming over in October. And if it's not then, I'm

07:52.807 --> 07:54.509
sure he'll be here by January. And I hope you get a 
chance to meet him. He's incredible. As I say, I

07:55.890 --> 07:57.512
think he has an understanding of the Soviet 
military very, very well. It was

07:59.247 --> 08:19.590
quite a job. Are there any other things you'd like 
to add about T's? You've covered what your view is

08:21.853 --> 08:24.055
of the world, the function of T's, what should be 
and how it's changed. Are there any particular

08:24.075 --> 08:25.797
memories you have of dealing with T's that you'd 
like to add? No, I think I've probably related the

08:25.817 --> 08:26.978
essence of them all. You know, it has been a

08:31.057 --> 08:59.612
It's been, as far as I'm concerned, if Dick Thomas 
has had any success in

08:31.057 --> 08:59.612
this world, and whatever success lies ahead of me 
yet,

08:31.057 --> 08:59.612
that will be due

08:31.057 --> 08:59.612
in large part to T.S., which is undoubted, and to 
Harry Whitmore, and to Fred Benson, and to Skip

08:31.057 --> 08:59.612
Ford. Skip and I may

09:00.942 --> 09:25.521
have different

09:00.942 --> 09:25.521
views, but we

09:00.942 --> 09:25.521
agree on enough things, you know, that it'll go on. 
We're embarked on a new program now aimed at trying

09:25.541 --> 09:28.305
to get Texas A&M in a central position in this 
renaissance of space that has occurred. And if

09:28.325 --> 09:28.806
that If

09:29.528 --> 09:51.602
we're successful there,

09:29.528 --> 09:51.602
it will be because

09:29.528 --> 09:51.602
of teams. I don't know that I could

09:51.622 --> 09:56.329
add much more.

10:01.051 --> 10:22.983
I wish that

10:01.051 --> 10:22.983
TEAS had a little bit better relationship with the 
research

10:01.051 --> 10:22.983
foundation. I think they don't often appreciate 
what a tremendous asset the foundation has. The

10:25.667 --> 10:27.049
foundation's role has changed quite a lot over the 
last 20 years. And a lot of people go, because

10:27.069 --> 10:28.932
government research has changed a lot over the 
last 20 years, just the

10:29.553 --> 10:53.245
legal aspects

10:29.553 --> 10:53.245
of a contract with the government is incredibly 
more complex today than it was 20 years ago. And

10:53.265 --> 10:56.270
other things like, you know, affirmative action 
and all of that sort of thing that

10:53.265 --> 10:56.270
administratively has to be taken toward the 
foundation of that. So I'm not sure the T's, I don't

10:56.290 --> 10:58.092
think the relationship between the T's and the 
foundation Years past,

10:59.422 --> 11:13.798
it used

10:59.422 --> 11:13.798
to be like that. And now it's more like this. But I 
hope that Tease can...

11:15.140 --> 11:27.994
Two things that I hope for Tease, I guess.

11:32.632 --> 11:45.571
Forgive

11:32.632 --> 11:45.571
me if

11:32.632 --> 11:45.571
I'm airing dirty linen here or washing dirty 
linen. Not quite in public, but I guess almost. As

11:47.514 --> 11:59.972
you're probably aware, back when Benson was both 
dean and head of TEAS, there was a lot more

11:47.514 --> 11:59.972
congruence in the operations of the College of 
Engineering and

12:00.914 --> 12:19.554
the

12:00.914 --> 12:19.554
Engineering Experiment Station than there was 
since Dr. Page came in. And again, you can't fault

12:19.855 --> 12:20.555
what Dr. Page wanted to do. But he wanted the 
College of Engineering to go in one direction, and

12:21.596 --> 12:24.880
Dr. Porter wanted it to go in another direction. So 
we're now in a position now, as a guy

12:25.585 --> 12:48.741
who is principally teased, you know,

12:25.585 --> 12:48.741
I don't,

12:25.585 --> 12:48.741
it doesn't constrain my activities, but I know 
from my colleagues in aerospace engineering and

12:25.585 --> 12:48.741
in other departments that this dichotomy has 
caused us unsure of hell, frankly, in the past five

12:25.585 --> 12:48.741
years. Dr. Page wanted people

12:50.351 --> 12:56.482
to publish in the scholarly journals. He saw his 
primary mission as raising the scholarly

12:56.502 --> 13:10.927
image of the College of the University, and God 
knows you can't find that. However, when you have

13:10.948 --> 13:11.809
500 faculty members, And you have guys that 
haven't done that. It's sort of like a reprise on

13:16.028 --> 13:26.462
the situation we had back, you know, in the early 
60s, when we had department heads who were not

13:16.028 --> 13:26.462
research oriented. Which is not to say they're not 
good guys, you know, like Al Crump and the rest of

13:26.482 --> 13:29.445
them. But they were just trying to do things that 
those guys weren't

13:29.465 --> 13:36.594
equipped to handle. And so,

13:36.614 --> 13:40.259
Dr. Page wanted 500 faculty members to get in 
lockstep doing published research, scholarly

13:42.130 --> 13:49.881
research. And we have guys that were hired 
principally to teach. They were hired because

13:54.087 --> 14:00.576
they were great teachers, because they had a lot of 
industrial experience. And preparing people for

14:00.596 --> 14:07.345
industry is still, I think, a major

14:00.596 --> 14:07.345
objective of the college. Skip Porter is a very 
applied guy. He wants to say TEAS, again,

14:13.181 --> 14:26.542
as you've probably been told, the Austin, that is 
the state view of TEAS, is that of an economic

14:13.181 --> 14:26.542
development agency. It is not an educational 
function. A lot of people don't realize that.

14:32.080 --> 14:43.352
Well, that says Tease is going to do not 
necessarily a whole bunch of scholarly research.

14:43.452 --> 14:55.564
And given Dr. Porter's industrial experience and 
having spent time at TI and so forth, why, he has a

14:43.452 --> 14:55.564
different view of the world than Dr. Page has. Here 
are these poor faculty members, and they don't

14:58.169 --> 15:03.456
know which guy to follow. And Page controls their 
promotion and tenure, and Dr. Porter controls the

15:03.476 --> 15:15.112
seed money for their research.

15:15.132 --> 15:18.918
We have 16 open positions in the Department of 
Electrical Engineering. Sixteen! Now you know

15:23.264 --> 15:24.345
why.

15:27.616 --> 15:33.404
That's going

15:27.616 --> 15:33.404
to change. The new super dean, whoever he is, 
hopefully

15:33.425 --> 15:48.467
will weld this thing back together into the unit it 
once was under Mr. Benson. When I came here and was a

15:48.487 --> 15:52.172
department member in aerospace engineering, 
there was no difference

15:52.540 --> 16:05.200
between what I, what, what Tease wanted me to do and 
what the department wanted me

15:52.540 --> 16:05.200
to do. They were exactly congruent. And that's why 
it was such a beautiful, beautiful set. Now it's

16:10.147 --> 16:12.611
not. And somehow, someway, we've got to get back to 
that. And This is not oral history, I guess. Well,

16:21.368 --> 16:22.550
it will be. Pardon me? It will be. Well, hopefully 
sometime. It'll be interesting to see how it turns

16:25.613 --> 16:29.839
out, whether or not either or not. You know, maybe 
it's irreversible. I mean, maybe

16:32.582 --> 16:37.689
we can't get back to London. I don't know. All I can 
say is that the relationship between Pease and the

16:39.271 --> 16:45.058
College of Engineering today is not what it was 
five years

16:45.983 --> 16:54.054
ago. And I don't know, you know, maybe if you look at 
the, if you look at the legislation that set up TEAS

16:55.315 --> 17:08.913
back in 2014, was it? As Dr. Porter said, we are the 
Texas Engineering Experiment Station. We are not

17:13.199 --> 17:14.100
the Texas A&M Experiment Station. And that's, you 
know, that says volumes. We are, TEAS is here to

17:16.257 --> 17:27.070
serve the state. Well, I don't know. It may never 
ever be like it was before.

17:38.604 --> 17:39.285
Quite like it was. I kind of hope it will be because I 
think TEAS, has been and can be the way by

17:42.582 --> 18:07.813
which we can get the right young

17:42.582 --> 18:07.813
people in here. And, I mean, if you, you know, if 
we're in a situation where TEAS is like Southwest

18:07.833 --> 18:12.319
Research Institute or Mattel or, you know, going 
off its own very way, sort of, maybe housed here on

18:13.497 --> 18:31.722
the Texas A&M campus, but really having very 
little to do with Texas A&M as such, or relatively

18:13.497 --> 18:31.722
little to do, then the College of Engineering is 
going to be like Georgia Tech was with me. They're

18:31.742 --> 18:36.028
not going to have any money to work with. And when a 
young guy comes in and says, well, do you have money

18:38.236 --> 18:47.427
for promoting research? They'll say, yeah, you 
can take that out of your research money, like

18:47.447 --> 18:50.391
Georgia Tech told me. And that ain't going to fly. 
That's not going to watch. So TEAS has been,

18:57.179 --> 19:07.652
I think, an enormous contributor to the growth of 
the university. I

19:09.117 --> 19:32.286
think

19:09.117 --> 19:32.286
unquestionably the fact that we have the largest

19:09.117 --> 19:32.286
college of engineering in the country here is due 
to TEAS. It's due, and TEAS has supported the

19:32.306 --> 19:34.930
evolution of the research program that has drawn 
Texas A&M a tremendous amount of respect. Of

19:34.950 --> 19:37.453
course, we've always had that very, very strong 
undergraduate research program And young

19:37.805 --> 19:54.386
people, I think, across the state of Texas still 
perceive a degree in engineering from Texas A&M to

19:37.805 --> 19:54.386
be a significant step up the ladder of success. I 
think we're still, locally, that is within the

19:54.406 --> 20:01.855
state, I think our undergraduate education 
program is highly revered. And I don't want to

20:03.910 --> 20:07.793
sacrifice that. I think we need to hang on to that. 
So I don't want to tease

20:11.637 --> 20:26.530
to do anything that would weaken

20:11.637 --> 20:26.530
that image. I don't know. It seems to me that there 
are people on up in the university who are prepared

20:33.560 --> 21:00.377
to sacrifice

20:33.560 --> 21:00.377
that in order to achieve greatness,

20:33.560 --> 21:00.377
whatever that is, that we will become like MIT in 
the sense of having a pedestrian undergraduate

20:33.560 --> 21:00.377
program with a heavy focus on Nobel Prize winners 
and scholarly publications and all kinds of

20:33.560 --> 21:00.377
highfalutin research. I think we have to

21:02.888 --> 21:13.303
remember that we are a land-grant institution. We 
were established, like all other

21:13.323 --> 21:25.420
land-grant schools, prior to the enactment of the 
Morrill Act back in 1870 or thereabouts, higher

21:13.323 --> 21:25.420
education was the province of the wealthy. And 
unless you were

21:26.800 --> 21:36.211
affluent, you just couldn't get a higher 
education. And that's what the land grant schools

21:36.231 --> 21:38.093
were intended to do, to bring education to the 
masses. And I'll be damned if I see any need to turn

21:38.113 --> 21:42.177
away from that. I don't feel badly. I mean, if I want 
to be a highfalutin guy, I'll go to Caltech or MIT.

21:51.067 --> 21:53.550
And I just don't understand why why some of our 
administration

21:54.357 --> 22:03.932
has to drive us away from that. How many MITs do we 
need? I think one's enough, really.

22:15.485 --> 22:20.070
So I think we have contributed greatly to the 
state. I think that the T's unquestionably, T's

22:20.090 --> 22:37.869
support and actions have undergirded the 
contribution that we've made to the state of Texas

22:20.090 --> 22:37.869
and to the nation. And I just,

22:37.889 --> 22:45.357
I said maybe it is time to move on to some higher 
plateau. Maybe this is what you're hearing is just

22:46.248 --> 22:58.007
the bleeding of a guy who's out of it, whose views 
are passe. That could well be, I suppose. Maybe I

23:04.177 --> 23:09.767
long for the good old days.

23:09.787 --> 23:11.209
Of course, they say you can never go back. Maybe 
there is some sort of a new relationship

23:11.695 --> 23:27.033
out there, a new framework in which T's can 
function effectively. Could well be. But if that

23:30.116 --> 23:37.905
means sacrificing what we

23:30.116 --> 23:37.905
have accomplished in the past, if it means 
destroying the strengths on which this

23:39.607 --> 23:46.056
institution has been

23:39.607 --> 23:46.056
built. I guess I'm reluctant

23:46.076 --> 23:51.264
to do that. I don't see that it needs to be done. I 
don't see why you have

23:53.828 --> 24:05.925
to destroy something in order to achieve 
something else. Maybe you have to, but I don't see

24:05.945 --> 24:07.187
it. So I think TEAS has been an absolutely great 
institution. in

24:10.792 --> 24:29.585
terms of what it's done for the nation, for the 
state, for the university,

24:10.792 --> 24:29.585
and of course for Dick Thomas. I think that it may be 
necessary to to change the road

24:32.898 --> 24:53.543
that we're on, or the path that we're on again. And 
we're going to continue to provide that kind of

24:53.563 --> 24:57.969
support. Well, I don't know. Obviously, my 
admiration and respect of T's is unbounded,

24:58.389 --> 25:00.492
because I've been fortunate enough to have been a

25:01.400 --> 25:22.352
part of it in its formative

25:01.400 --> 25:22.352
years, shall we say, when it really grew and really 
blossomed. I kind of wish that other institutions

25:22.372 --> 25:29.803
could see what TEAS has done

25:22.372 --> 25:29.803
for Texas A&M and for the state and could learn from 
that. and

25:30.560 --> 25:38.227
maybe replicate it in some form or other. Because I 
think it can serve other states as well as it has

25:38.247 --> 25:52.980
served Texas with the proper leadership.

25:54.061 --> 25:57.384
And again, I'm not going to agree it's important. 
It obviously has to have a... a good view of the kind

25:58.808 --> 26:18.932
of contribution that

25:58.808 --> 26:18.932
it can

25:58.808 --> 26:18.932
make and the kind of strengths that it has to have to 
make this contribution. So with proper

26:18.952 --> 26:21.475
leadership, I think that TEAS and other states 
could be as effective as it has been doing. Well,

26:22.163 --> 26:33.523
thank you for all your time.
