WEBVTT

00:04.520 --> 00:08.043
the specific organization. They have been given 
money. So,

00:09.984 --> 00:46.030
I came to the States

00:09.984 --> 00:46.030
after

00:09.984 --> 00:46.030
the Senate

00:47.000 --> 00:58.329
was

00:47.000 --> 00:58.329
in operation.

01:00.170 --> 01:04.373
I went down. John got off

01:04.393 --> 01:29.572
the

01:04.393 --> 01:29.572
airplane.

01:29.812 --> 01:39.820
John had discovered

01:29.812 --> 01:39.820
that this outfitter in Washington had put his name 
and resume on a proposal

01:41.040 --> 01:53.630
to be in John's parlance is just

01:53.610 --> 02:14.072
totally

01:53.610 --> 02:14.072
on

01:53.610 --> 02:14.072
the way, on the way home. And John,

02:14.092 --> 02:21.420
he's an avid conversationalist and his mind is so 
at least it wears me out. But

02:32.255 --> 02:33.880
uncharacteristically in this all the way up here. 
And then he

02:38.135 --> 02:54.020
laughs and he

02:38.135 --> 02:54.020
was

02:38.135 --> 02:54.020
obviously really upset about that, talking about 
it. And then he must, that must have happened 60

02:57.211 --> 03:01.044
times. Oh, just

03:01.064 --> 03:05.740
this. And so he came to Texas A&M. He had practiced 
with,

03:10.491 --> 03:23.440
in short, he

03:10.491 --> 03:23.440
had never seen a university. And being a military 
historian, it was a different institution.

03:35.141 --> 03:39.950
I don't

03:35.141 --> 03:39.950
really know what he saw in the center because we 
were very ill-formed at that time. And I think that

03:44.010 --> 03:46.420
might have been attractive. He feels and felt and 
feels very keenly about, about the need to train

03:51.240 --> 03:56.111
the bright young people to do so. And of course, he 
has he has his own standards and his own

03:57.480 --> 04:06.065
methodology for doing that. And so I think he saw 
here a chance to help shape something that, it

04:08.430 --> 04:27.720
turns out that A&M, I guess,

04:08.430 --> 04:27.720
would

04:08.430 --> 04:27.720
probably be more charitable than that. And say 
that John's, John's view as a real genuine Soviet

04:29.409 --> 04:35.700
expert has colored my view of

04:36.400 --> 04:48.202
how Soviet studies ought to be done.

04:52.509 --> 04:52.850
So he so then he went back on his way back through 
Washington.

05:07.147 --> 05:17.760
He was well established in all of his 
publications. He

05:17.740 --> 05:37.851
was

05:17.740 --> 05:37.851
able to ride John's coat.

05:37.871 --> 05:43.400
Now I don't, I should add, it has not, it has been a 
somewhat stormy relationship. John, John does

05:43.380 --> 05:48.870
not know the meaning of the word deadline. The only 
time he worries about money is when

05:50.640 --> 05:58.618
he doesn't have any.

05:58.638 --> 06:05.112
He's eccentric, difficult to get along with. And 
so it's, it's been, it's been a turbulent

06:08.760 --> 06:11.932
relationship.

06:11.953 --> 06:18.980
John's reputation, although he has a reputation 
of, is a tremendous scholar. There are other

06:18.960 --> 06:23.158
aspects of his reputation that are not good. He is 
well known for committing himself to go and

06:25.930 --> 06:33.669
present a paper,

06:25.930 --> 06:33.669
for making commitments. And, and in defense of 
John, he's, he will not say no. And he and I now have

06:38.520 --> 06:43.660
become close enough friends that I can chastise 
him. It's

06:43.640 --> 06:53.420
unfair for you to tell people you'll do something 
and they won't do it. ...get

06:53.400 --> 07:10.581
the relationship on balance, I think. But

07:10.601 --> 07:17.530
there have been some sponsors that because John 
has promised to deliver and hasn't yet,

07:17.510 --> 07:30.100
you know, to some extent we get tired with that. It 
has, while it hasn't been a totally positive

07:30.080 --> 07:37.970
relationship,

07:30.080 --> 07:37.970
but he'll be here hopefully, he said he's coming 
over in October.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.889
I hope you get a chance to meet him. He, as I say, I 
think he has, he has an understanding of the Soviet

07:48.909 --> 08:02.440
military, very.

08:02.420 --> 08:09.230
Are

08:02.420 --> 08:09.230
there any other things you'd like to add about, to 
use, you've covered what your view is pretty well,

08:09.210 --> 08:19.780
of

08:09.210 --> 08:19.780
the function of T's, which are, are there any 
particular memories you have of dealing with T's

08:09.210 --> 08:19.780
that you'd like to add? No, I think I've probably, 
probably related the essence of, of them all. You

08:24.728 --> 08:26.780
know, it has been, it's

08:26.760 --> 08:42.340
been, as far as I'm concerned, if Dick Thomas has 
had any success in this world, and whatever

08:42.320 --> 09:00.860
success lies ahead of me yet,

08:42.320 --> 09:00.860
and

08:42.320 --> 09:00.860
to Harry Whitmore, and to Fred Benson, and to Skip 
Portman. Skip and I may have different views,

09:00.840 --> 09:08.360
but we agree on enough things, you know. We're

09:08.340 --> 09:23.140
embarked on a new program now, and in a central 
position in this renaissance of space

09:23.120 --> 09:41.429
that

09:23.120 --> 09:41.429
is occurring. If we're successful there, it will 
be . I don't, I don't know that I could,

09:42.210 --> 10:05.060
I

09:42.210 --> 10:05.060
wish that T's had a little bit better relationship 
with the Research Foundation. I think they don't

10:07.551 --> 10:12.110
often appreciate what a tremendous asset the 
Foundation has. The Foundation's role has

10:15.061 --> 10:22.450
changed

10:15.061 --> 10:22.450
quite a lot over the last, a lot of people don't 
because, because government research

10:22.430 --> 10:29.895
has changed a lot. Just the legal aspects of a 
contract

10:31.440 --> 10:43.050
with the government, a lot of people don't come in 
and sort of, you know, affirmative action and all

10:43.030 --> 10:50.030
that sort of thing that administratively has to be 
taken care of by the Foundation itself.

10:53.665 --> 10:59.890
So I don't think the relationship between the T's 
and the Foundation, in years past, it used to be

10:59.870 --> 11:02.693
like that. And now

11:03.774 --> 11:26.540
it's,

11:03.774 --> 11:26.540
it's, I hope that T's can,

11:03.774 --> 11:26.540
two things that I hope for T's, I guess.

11:32.762 --> 11:37.820
I don't, forgive me if I'm, if I'm erring and 
stirring the chair, but, at least I don't think

11:37.800 --> 11:41.500
it's an email address for a situation like this. It 
doesn't have to be. So let's thru kuér. To

11:44.280 --> 11:56.510
give for T's.

12:00.650 --> 12:04.910
As you're probably aware, congruence in the 
operations of the College of Engineering and the

12:04.890 --> 12:18.137
Engineer Experimentation

12:04.890 --> 12:18.137
that there was since Dr. Page came in. Again, you 
can't fault what Dr. Page looks at all, but he

12:24.119 --> 12:29.220
wanted the College of Engineering I don't want

12:29.200 --> 12:46.890
to principally tease my activities, but I know 
from my colleagues in aerospace engineering and

12:29.200 --> 12:46.890
in other departments that this dichotomy has 
carved us unsurely in hell. Dr.

12:50.400 --> 12:55.133
Page wanted people to publish in the scholarly 
journals. He saw his primary mission as raising

12:55.254 --> 13:01.070
the scholarly image of the College of 
Engineering. He

13:01.050 --> 13:15.460
was convinced that it was necessary, and God knows 
you can't find them when you have 500 faculty

13:01.050 --> 13:15.460
members and you have guys that haven't done that. 
It's sort of like a reprise on the situation we had

13:15.440 --> 13:22.460
back in the early 60s when we had department heads 
who were not research oriented. Which is not to say

13:22.440 --> 13:35.460
they're not good guys like Al Crump and Samad and 
the rest of them, but they were just trying to do

13:22.440 --> 13:35.460
things that those guys weren't equipped to 
handle. And so, God knows you can't find them. It's

13:36.940 --> 13:39.780
sort of like a reprise on the situation we had back 
in the early 60s when we had department heads who

13:36.940 --> 13:39.780
were not research oriented. Dr. Page wanted 500 
faculty members to get in lockstep doing

13:40.543 --> 13:50.420
published research, scholarly research.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.700
We have guys that were hired principally to teach. 
They were hired because they were great teachers,

13:53.680 --> 13:59.750
because they had a lot of industrial experience. 
And preparing people for industry is still, I

13:59.730 --> 14:10.700
think, a major objective of the company.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.469
It's a very applied job. He wants to see TEAS, 
again, as you've probably been told, the Austin,

14:18.680 --> 14:26.700
that is the state view of TEAS, is that of an 
economic development agency. It is not an

14:26.680 --> 14:30.326
educational function. A lot of people don't 
realize that. Well, that says TEAS is going to do,

14:32.280 --> 14:42.100
not necessarily, a whole bunch of scholarly 
research.

14:42.080 --> 14:49.100
And... And given Dr. Porter's industrial 
experience and having spent time at TI and so

14:42.080 --> 14:49.100
forth, why, he has a different view of the world 
than Dr. Page has. And so, he's

14:55.260 --> 15:02.640
full of faculty members, and they don't know which 
guy to follow. And Page controls their promotion

15:02.620 --> 15:06.640
and tenure. Porter controls the seed money for 
their research. We

15:10.440 --> 15:20.660
have 16 open positions in the Department of 
Electricity. 16!

15:27.736 --> 15:28.440
That's going to change. The

15:28.420 --> 15:38.950
new super dean, whoever he is, hopefully will weld 
this thing back together into the unit it once was.

15:38.930 --> 15:49.980
When

15:38.930 --> 15:49.980
I came here as a department member in physics 
engineering, there was no what TEAS wanted me to do

15:49.960 --> 15:58.720
and what the department wanted me to do. They were 
exactly congruent.

16:04.210 --> 16:14.470
And that's why it was such a beautiful,

16:04.210 --> 16:14.470
somehow, someway, we've got to get back to that. 
This

16:14.450 --> 16:18.480
is not oral history. It's not oral history, I 
guess. Well, it will be. Pardon me? It will be.

16:24.460 --> 16:25.481
Well, hopefully sometime. It'll be interesting 
to see how it turns out, whether or not either or

16:25.460 --> 16:29.480
not. You know, maybe it's irreversible. I mean,

16:32.460 --> 16:37.740
maybe we can get back. But it's... All I can say is 
that the relationship between TEAS and the

16:37.720 --> 16:43.820
College of Engineering today is not what it was 
five years ago. You

16:47.720 --> 16:56.890
know, maybe if you look at the... If you look at the 
legislation that set up TEAS back in 1914, was it?

17:01.870 --> 17:08.270
We

17:01.870 --> 17:08.270
are the Texas Engineering Experiment Station. We 
are not the Texas A&M Experiment Station. And

17:11.250 --> 17:15.290
that's, you know, that says volumes. We are... 
TEAS is here to serve the state. Well,

17:19.290 --> 17:32.380
it may never, it may never ever be like it was 
before. I

17:32.360 --> 17:42.670
kind of hope it will be because I think TEAS has 
been, and can be, the way. I mean,

17:46.650 --> 18:15.190
if you, you know, if we're in a situation where TEAS 
is like Southwest Research Institute,

18:15.170 --> 18:22.820
housed here on the Texas A&M campus but really 
having very little to do with Texas A&M as such,

18:22.800 --> 18:30.310
then

18:22.800 --> 18:30.310
the College of Engineering is going to be like 
Georgia Tech was with me. They're not going to have

18:30.290 --> 18:38.460
any money to work with. And when a young guy comes in 
and says, well, they'll say, yeah, you can take

18:39.440 --> 18:45.460
that out of your research money. And that ain't 
going to fly. TEAS

18:51.120 --> 19:07.400
has been,

18:51.120 --> 19:07.400
I think, an enormous contributor to the growth of 
the university. Questionably,

19:07.380 --> 19:17.060
the fact that we have the largest college of 
engineering in the country here is due to TEAS.

19:17.040 --> 19:26.460
TEAS

19:17.040 --> 19:26.460
has supported the evolution of the research 
program that has drawn Texas A&M, and I think

19:26.440 --> 19:45.820
across the state of Texas,

19:26.440 --> 19:45.820
still perceive a degree in engineering from Texas 
A&M to be a significant step up the ladder of

19:45.800 --> 19:48.940
success. I think we're still, locally within the 
state, I think our undergraduate education

19:48.920 --> 19:59.490
program is highly revered. And

19:59.470 --> 20:05.320
I don't want to sacrifice that. I don't, you know, I 
think we need to hang on to that. So I wouldn't, you

20:08.360 --> 20:19.000
know, I don't want TEAS to do anything that would 
weaken the network. I don't

20:18.980 --> 20:32.100
know, it seems to me that there are people on up in 
the university who are prepared to sacrifice that

20:32.080 --> 20:38.130
in order to achieve greatness. We

20:38.110 --> 20:47.860
will become like MIT in the sense of having a 
pedestrian undergraduate with a heavy focus on

20:47.840 --> 21:00.330
Nobel Shoes

20:47.840 --> 21:00.330
and all kinds of high-quality research. I think we 
have to remember that we are a land-grant

21:00.310 --> 21:06.240
institution. We were established. Like all other 
land-grant schools, seven years or thereabouts,

21:22.830 --> 21:26.860
higher education was the province of the wealthy. 
And unless you were affluent, you just couldn't

21:26.840 --> 21:29.860
get a higher education. And that's what the 
land-grant schools were intended to do, to bring

21:33.840 --> 21:37.900
education to the masses. And I'll be damned if I see 
any need to turn away from that. I don't feel badly.

21:43.880 --> 21:48.900
I mean, if I want to be a highfalutin guy, I'll go to 
Caltech or MIT. And I just don't understand why

21:50.960 --> 21:59.120
some

21:50.960 --> 21:59.120
of our administration has to drive us away from 
that. How many MITs do we need? One's enough,

22:08.400 --> 22:15.620
really.

22:15.600 --> 22:19.620
So I think we have contributed greatly to the 
state. I think that the T's unquestionably, the

22:19.600 --> 22:27.570
T's support and actions have undergirded the 
contribution to the state of Texas and to the

22:27.550 --> 22:34.510
nation. I

22:34.490 --> 22:46.090
said,

22:34.490 --> 22:46.090
maybe it is time to move on to some higher plateau. 
Maybe this is what you're hearing is just the

22:46.070 --> 22:55.150
bleating of a guy who's out of it, who's our passe. 
Maybe

22:58.150 --> 23:05.800
I long for the good old days. Maybe

23:05.780 --> 23:19.220
there is some sort of a new relationship out there,

23:19.200 --> 23:20.221
a new framework. T's can function, could well be, 
but if that means sacrificing what we have

23:27.250 --> 23:34.150
accomplished in the past. T's destroyed the 
strengths on which this institution has been

23:34.130 --> 23:42.340
built. I

23:42.320 --> 23:50.540
guess I'm reluctant to do that. I don't see that it 
needs to be done. I don't see why you have to destroy

23:52.520 --> 23:55.540
something. I think

23:55.520 --> 24:09.040
T's has been an absolutely great institution for

24:09.020 --> 24:16.800
the nation, for the state, for the university. 
And, of course, for Dick Thomas. I think

24:18.960 --> 24:33.500
that it may be necessary to change the road. Well, I 
don't

24:33.480 --> 24:44.510
know. Obviously,

24:44.490 --> 24:55.200
my admiration and respect of T's is unbounded. 
I've been a part of it formative years,

24:55.180 --> 25:06.860
shall we say, when it really grew and really 
blossomed. I

25:09.840 --> 25:18.140
kind of wish that other institutions could

25:18.120 --> 25:25.410
see what T's has done for Texas A&M and for the state 
and

25:25.390 --> 25:37.130
could learn from that, replicate

25:25.390 --> 25:37.130
it in some form or other. Because I think it can 
serve other states as well as it has served

25:40.110 --> 25:45.780
with the proper leadership. And, again, I'm not 
going to say that it has to have a

25:45.760 --> 25:59.620
good view of the kind of contribution that it can 
make and the kind of strengths that it has to have to

26:07.190 --> 26:08.680
make this contribution. It's

26:08.660 --> 26:24.590
with proper leadership, I wish. T's would be E-E-S 
of whatever state. Kansas is an interesting one.

26:30.680 --> 26:33.700
Well, I thank you for all your time.
