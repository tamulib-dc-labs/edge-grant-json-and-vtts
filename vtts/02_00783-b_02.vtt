WEBVTT

00:04.520 --> 00:08.043
the specific organization. They have been given 
money.

00:13.907 --> 00:46.030
So I came to the States

00:13.907 --> 00:46.030
after

00:13.907 --> 00:46.030
the Senate

00:46.010 --> 00:58.317
operation

00:46.010 --> 00:58.317
was in

00:46.010 --> 00:58.317
operation.

01:01.419 --> 01:06.742
I went down. John

01:06.762 --> 01:20.089
got

01:06.762 --> 01:20.089
off the airplane.

01:21.590 --> 01:39.820
John

01:21.590 --> 01:39.820
had discovered

01:21.590 --> 01:39.820
that this outfit in Washington had put his name and 
resume on a proposal

01:41.040 --> 01:54.350
to be in John's parlance is just totally

01:54.330 --> 02:14.171
on

01:54.330 --> 02:14.171
the way on the way home. And

02:14.191 --> 02:22.480
John, he's an avid conversationalist. His mind is 
so it

02:22.920 --> 02:32.677
wears

02:22.920 --> 02:32.677
me out. But uncharacteristically

02:32.918 --> 02:45.360
in this

02:32.918 --> 02:45.360
all the way up here, and then he laughs and he was 
obviously

02:45.340 --> 02:57.784
really upset about that, talking about it. And 
that must have happened 60 times. Oh, just this.

03:06.017 --> 03:06.640
And so he came to Texas A&M. He

03:12.854 --> 03:22.335
had practiced with, in short,

03:12.854 --> 03:22.335
he had never seen a university. And being a 
military historian, it was a different

03:24.340 --> 03:35.700
institution. I

03:35.981 --> 03:41.150
don't really know what he saw in the center because 
we were very ill formed at that time. And I think

03:43.726 --> 03:46.444
that might have been attractive. He feels and felt 
and feels very keenly about about the need to train

03:47.470 --> 03:56.098
bright young people to do so. And of course, he has, 
he has his own standards and his own methodology

03:59.020 --> 04:06.080
for doing that. And so I think he saw here a chance to 
help shape something that, it turns out that A&M, I

04:09.510 --> 04:28.940
guess,

04:09.510 --> 04:28.940
would probably be more charitable than that. And 
say that John's, John's view as a real genuine

04:28.920 --> 04:38.860
Soviet expert has colored my view of how Soviet 
studies ought to be done. So he, so then he went back

04:44.390 --> 04:55.530
on his way

04:44.390 --> 04:55.530
to Texas A&M, and he said, you know, on

04:55.510 --> 05:30.780
his way back through Washington, he will be well 
established with all of his publications. He was

05:30.800 --> 05:31.080
able to ride John's coattail.

05:37.862 --> 05:43.380
Now, I don't, I should add, it has not, it has been a 
somewhat stormy relationship. John, John does

05:43.360 --> 05:48.869
not know the meaning of the word deadline. The only 
time he worries about money is when he doesn't

05:51.020 --> 05:55.550
have any.

05:58.637 --> 06:05.112
He's eccentric, difficult to get along with. And 
so it's, it's been, it's been a turbulent

06:08.740 --> 06:09.584
relationship.

06:11.793 --> 06:15.730
John's reputation, although he has a reputation 
of, you know, he has a reputation of, you know, he's

06:15.710 --> 06:20.511
a tremendous scholar. There are other aspects of 
his reputation that are not good. He is well known

06:23.544 --> 06:24.890
for committing himself to go and present a paper,

06:24.870 --> 06:33.574
for making commitments. And, and, and in defense 
of John, he's, he will not say no. And he and I now

06:39.009 --> 06:47.352
have become close enough friends that I can 
chastise

06:39.009 --> 06:47.352
him. It's unfair for you to tell people you'll do 
something and then not do it. ...together,

06:53.060 --> 07:07.490
and I get the relationship. ...on balance, I 
think.

07:14.733 --> 07:20.310
But there have been some sponsors that, because 
John has promised to deliver, and hasn't, get,

07:20.290 --> 07:27.407
you know, to some extent, we get tired of that. And 
it has, while it hasn't been a totally positive

07:33.020 --> 07:42.542
relationship,

07:33.020 --> 07:42.542
but he'll be here, hopefully, the setting's 
coming over in October. I hope you get a chance to

07:42.562 --> 07:50.600
meet

07:42.562 --> 07:50.600
him. As I say, I think he has, he has an 
understanding of the Soviet military that

07:50.580 --> 08:02.060
very...

08:02.040 --> 08:08.060
Are

08:02.040 --> 08:08.060
there any other things you'd like to add about, if 
he's, you've covered what your view is, pretty

08:02.040 --> 08:08.060
much. The

08:08.040 --> 08:17.314
function of the Soviet Soviet Union. Are there any 
particular memories you have of dealing with

08:17.334 --> 08:19.120
things that you'd like to add? No, I think I've 
probably, probably related the essence of, of

08:19.100 --> 08:24.134
them all. You know, it has been a, it's

08:24.556 --> 08:33.120
been, as far as I'm concerned, if Dick Thomas has 
had any success in this role, and whatever success

08:33.100 --> 08:45.040
lies ahead of me yet, and

08:45.020 --> 08:59.980
to Harry Whitmore, and to Fred Benson, and to Skip 
Horton. Well, Skip and I may have different views,

08:59.960 --> 09:07.780
but, but we agree on enough things, you know. We're

09:07.760 --> 09:23.920
embarked on a new program now, aimed at, in a 
central position in this renaissance of space

09:07.760 --> 09:23.920
that is occurring. If

09:23.900 --> 09:42.418
we're

09:23.900 --> 09:42.418
successful there, it will be perfect.

09:42.438 --> 10:04.520
I don't, I don't know that I could,

09:42.438 --> 10:04.520
I wish that TEAS had a little bit better 
relationship with the Research Foundation. I

10:06.500 --> 10:14.830
think, I think they don't often appreciate what a 
tremendous asset the Foundation is. The

10:14.810 --> 10:23.150
Foundation's role has changed

10:14.810 --> 10:23.150
quite a lot over the last, I mean, a lot of people 
don't, because, because government research has

10:23.130 --> 10:27.150
changed a lot. Just

10:27.130 --> 10:41.990
the legal aspects of a contract

10:27.130 --> 10:41.990
with the government, a lot of legal outcomes are 
here. Affirmative action, you know, that sort of

10:41.970 --> 10:50.290
thing, administratively, has to be taken care of 
in the Foundation. So, I, I don't think the

10:50.270 --> 10:55.520
relationship, the relationship between the TEAS 
and the Foundation, in years past, it used to be

10:55.500 --> 11:02.150
like that. Now

11:02.130 --> 11:32.640
it's,

11:02.130 --> 11:32.640
it's, I hope that TEAS can,

11:02.130 --> 11:32.640
two things that I hope for TEAS,

11:02.130 --> 11:32.640
I guess. I don't, forgive me if I'm, if I'm airing 
dirty linen here, or washing dirty linen, not

11:40.620 --> 11:47.690
quite in public, but I guess almost.

11:47.670 --> 11:59.690
As you're probably aware,

11:47.670 --> 11:59.690
congruence in the operations of the College of 
Engineering, and the Engineering Experiment

11:59.670 --> 12:04.683
Station, than there, than there was since Dr. Page 
came in. Again,

12:05.670 --> 12:10.540
you can't fault what Dr. Page wanted to do,

12:10.600 --> 12:19.940
but he wanted the College of Engineering to go in 
one direction. So, we're, we're now in a position,

12:19.920 --> 12:36.590
now, as a guy who has principally TEAS

12:19.920 --> 12:36.590
activities, but I know from my colleagues in 
aerospace engineering, and in other

12:36.570 --> 12:40.590
departments, that, that this dichotomy has 
carved us unsurely in hell. Dr.

12:50.391 --> 12:54.770
Page wanted people to publish in the scholarly 
journals. He saw his primary mission as raising

12:54.750 --> 13:00.770
the scholarly image of the College of 
Engineering, and God knows you can't fault him for

13:00.750 --> 13:02.770
that. When

13:02.750 --> 13:14.160
you have 500 faculty members, and you have guys 
that haven't done that, it's, it's sort of like a

13:14.140 --> 13:19.160
reprise on the situation we had back, you know, in 
the early 60s, when we had department heads who

13:19.140 --> 13:22.160
were not research oriented. Which is not to say 
they're not good guys, you know, like Al Crump and

13:24.140 --> 13:28.160
Saman and the rest of them. But, but they were just 
trying to do things that, that those guys weren't

13:28.140 --> 13:35.160
equipped to handle. And so,

13:35.140 --> 13:39.895
Dr. Page wanted 500 faculty members to get in 
lockstep doing published research, scholarly

13:40.075 --> 13:48.200
research. We have guys that were hired 
principally to teach, and they were hired because

13:53.100 --> 13:58.400
they were great teachers, because they had a lot of 
industrial experience. And, and preparing

13:59.430 --> 14:10.400
people for industry is still, I think, a major 
objective of

13:59.430 --> 14:10.400
the college. Dr. Page is a very applied guy. He, he 
wants to see TEAS, again, as you've probably been

14:12.380 --> 14:18.400
told, the Austin, that is the state view of TEAS, is 
of, is that of an economic development agency. It

14:26.380 --> 14:29.840
is not an educational function. A lot of people 
don't realize that. Well, that says TEAS is going

14:31.980 --> 14:35.340
to, they do not necessarily a whole bunch of 
scholarly research,

14:35.320 --> 14:41.800
you see. And, and, and given Dr. Porter's 
industrial experience, and having spent time at

14:46.780 --> 14:49.800
TI and so forth, why, he, he has a different view of 
the world than Dr. Page has. And so, these poor

14:55.960 --> 15:03.340
faculty members, and they don't know which guy to 
follow. And Page controls their promotion and

15:03.320 --> 15:08.160
tenure. Porter controls the seed money for their 
research.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.220
He has 16 open positions in the Department of 
Electricity. Sixteen!

15:27.769 --> 15:31.280
That's going to change.

15:31.260 --> 15:34.280
The new super dean, whoever he is, hopefully will 
weld this thing back together into the unit it once

15:34.260 --> 15:39.650
was. When

15:39.630 --> 15:50.680
I came here as a department, department member in 
physics engineering, there was no what TEAS

15:50.660 --> 15:59.670
wanted me to do and what the department wanted. 
They were exactly congruent. And

16:01.650 --> 16:05.930
that's why it was such a beautiful, somehow,

16:05.910 --> 16:17.180
someway, we've got to get back to that. This is not 
oral history, I guess. Well, it will be. Pardon me?

16:23.119 --> 16:24.180
It will be. Well, hopefully sometime. It'll be 
interesting to see how it turns out, whether or

16:25.160 --> 16:29.180
not, either or not. You know, maybe, maybe it's 
irreversible. I mean, maybe we can

16:32.160 --> 16:37.440
get back. But it's, all I can say is that the 
relationship between TEAS and the College of

16:37.420 --> 16:43.520
Engineering today is not what it was five years 
ago. You

16:47.420 --> 16:56.590
know, maybe if you look at the, if you look at the 
legislation that set up TEAS back in 1914,

16:56.570 --> 17:05.970
was it? We are the Texas Engineering Experiment 
Station. We are not the Texas A&M Experiment

17:08.950 --> 17:12.990
Station. And that's, you know, that says volumes. 
We are, TEAS is here to serve the state. Well,

17:19.990 --> 17:32.080
it may never, it may never ever be like it was 
before. I

17:32.060 --> 17:39.120
kind of hope it will be. Because I think TEAS has 
been and can be the way. I mean,

17:46.350 --> 18:07.860
if you, you know, if we're in a situation where TEAS 
is like Southwest Research Institute, housed

18:07.840 --> 18:22.520
here on the A&M campus, but really having very 
little to do with Texas A&M as such, or

18:22.500 --> 18:31.010
relevant to it, then the College of Engineering is 
going to be like Georgia Tech was with me. They're

18:30.990 --> 18:33.010
not going to have any money to work with. And when

18:32.990 --> 18:43.160
a young guy comes in and says, well, they'll say, 
yeah, you can take that out of your research money.

18:49.820 --> 18:59.090
And that ain't going to fly. TEAS has been, I think, 
an enormous contributor to the growth of the

18:59.070 --> 19:08.100
university. Unquestionably, the fact that we 
have the largest college of engineering in the

19:08.080 --> 19:19.160
country here is due to TEAS. TEAS has supported the 
evolution of the research program. That has drawn

19:23.140 --> 19:40.440
Texas A&M,

19:23.140 --> 19:40.440
I think across the state of

19:23.140 --> 19:40.440
Texas, still perceive a degree in engineering 
from Texas A&M to be a significant step up the

19:40.420 --> 19:48.640
ladder of success. I think we're still, locally 
within the state, I think our undergraduate

19:48.620 --> 19:59.190
education program is highly revered. And

19:59.170 --> 20:05.020
I don't want to sacrifice that. I don't, you know, I 
think we need to hang on to that. So

20:08.060 --> 20:12.920
I wouldn't, you know, I don't want TEAS, to

20:12.900 --> 20:20.700
do anything that would weaken that image. I

20:20.680 --> 20:31.800
don't know, it seems to me that there are people on 
up in the university who are prepared to sacrifice

20:31.780 --> 20:37.830
that in order to achieve greatness. We

20:37.810 --> 20:47.560
will become like MIT in the sense of having a 
pedestrian undergraduate with a heavy focus on

20:47.540 --> 21:00.030
Nobel Shores

20:47.540 --> 21:00.030
and all kinds of highfalutin research. I

21:00.010 --> 21:03.940
think we have to remember that we are a land grant 
institution. We were established, like all other

21:06.920 --> 21:12.180
land grant schools, 70 or thereabouts,

21:21.540 --> 21:25.550
higher education was the province of the wealthy. 
And unless you were affluent, you just couldn't

21:25.530 --> 21:29.560
get a higher education. And that's what the land 
grant schools were intended to do, to bring

21:33.540 --> 21:36.840
education to the masses. And I'll be damned if I see 
any need to turn away from that. I don't feel badly.

21:43.580 --> 21:44.601
I mean, if I want to, if I want to be a highfalutin 
guy, I'll go to Caltech or MIT. And I just don't

21:50.660 --> 21:53.680
understand why, why

21:53.660 --> 22:00.820
some of our administration has to, has to drive us 
away from that. How many MITs do we need? One's

22:08.100 --> 22:11.044
enough. Really? So

22:11.790 --> 22:17.320
I think we have, I think we've contributed greatly 
to the state. I think that, that T's

22:21.300 --> 22:24.380
unquestionable, T's support and actions have 
undergirded the contribution to the state of

22:29.250 --> 22:34.210
Texas and to the nation. I

22:34.190 --> 22:45.600
said,

22:34.190 --> 22:45.600
maybe it is time to move on to some higher plateau. 
Maybe this is, what you're hearing is just the

22:47.770 --> 22:53.730
bleating of a guy who's, who's out of it, who's our 
passe.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.500
Maybe I long for the good old days. Maybe

23:05.480 --> 23:13.060
there is some sort of, a new relationship out 
there, a new

23:15.040 --> 23:19.920
framework. T's can function, could well be, but

23:26.950 --> 23:33.850
if that means sacrificing what we have 
accomplished in the past, T's

23:33.830 --> 23:42.040
destroyed the strengths on which this 
institution has been built, I guess

23:42.020 --> 23:46.880
I'm reluctant to do that. I

23:46.860 --> 23:52.240
don't, I don't see that it needs to be done. I don't 
see why you have to destroy something. I think

23:55.220 --> 24:05.740
T's has, has been an absolutely great 
institution. For

24:08.720 --> 24:15.500
the nation, for the state, for the university, and 
of course for Dick Thomas. I

24:19.660 --> 24:44.210
think that it

24:19.660 --> 24:44.210
may be necessary

24:19.660 --> 24:44.210
to change

24:19.660 --> 24:44.210
the road. Well, I don't know. I, my, my, obviously 
my admiration and respect of T's is, is unbounded.

24:57.913 --> 25:02.950
I've been a part of it.

25:02.930 --> 25:07.560
Formative

25:02.930 --> 25:07.560
years, shall we say, when it really grew, when it 
really blossomed. I

25:09.540 --> 25:16.840
kind of wish that, that other institutions could 
see what T's has done for Texas A&M, and for the

25:24.090 --> 25:25.111
state, and

25:25.090 --> 25:32.020
could learn from that, replicate

25:32.000 --> 25:36.390
it in some form or other. Because I think it can 
serve other, other states as well as it has served

25:38.810 --> 25:45.480
with the proper leadership. And again, I'm not 
going to raise, it has to have a, a

25:56.010 --> 26:04.440
good view of the kind of contribution that it can 
make, the kind of strengths that it has to have, to

26:06.890 --> 26:12.160
make this work. With proper leadership, I

26:13.140 --> 26:26.290
think, T's would be E-E-S, whatever it's called. 
Kansas A&M. Well, I thank you for all your time.
