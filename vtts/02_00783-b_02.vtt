WEBVTT

00:03.727 --> 00:13.562
and I won't name the specific organization, but 
they had been given money, and a portion of that

00:03.727 --> 00:13.562
money was being given to John. Well, really not to 
John, but to John's operation that he has a little

00:13.602 --> 00:25.261
outfit over there, which is really for the 
secondary high school students, called Defense

00:13.602 --> 00:25.261
Studies. And so really the money is really for his 
office.

00:32.482 --> 00:47.876
And so John came to the States,

00:32.482 --> 00:47.876
and this was in 79, I guess. It was after the Senate

00:47.896 --> 01:00.787
had been formed and was in operation, and we were 
officed under Brian Lewis. And I went down to the

01:00.807 --> 01:01.628
Houston an Army colonel who

01:04.308 --> 01:14.320
was also a research associate. John got off the 
airplane, and although I had met him a couple of

01:17.044 --> 01:30.781
times before,

01:17.044 --> 01:30.781
I didn't know him all that well, but it was plain 
surprise. And, uh, and he proposed to me. told me

01:32.573 --> 01:53.319
as we came out of the airport that John had 
discovered that this outfit in Washington had put

01:32.573 --> 01:53.319
his

01:32.573 --> 01:53.319
name and resume on a proposal to the I.D. without 
his approval. That, in John's parlance, is just

01:53.779 --> 01:56.623
totally dishonest.

02:02.729 --> 02:25.813
So, on the way,

02:02.729 --> 02:25.813
on

02:02.729 --> 02:25.813
the way

02:02.729 --> 02:25.813
home from Houston to Continental, John is sitting 
up front with a man that comes in the same room. And

02:25.833 --> 02:26.593
John, of course, he's just a geek. He's an avid 
conversationalist, and his mind is so active, it

02:26.613 --> 02:30.137
just leaps and, you know, it wears me out to talk 
with him. But

02:31.838 --> 02:52.101
uncharacteristically,

02:31.838 --> 02:52.101
in this,

02:31.838 --> 02:52.101
we're all the way up here. He would talk animatedly 
for a while, and then he'd lapse into a silence. And

02:53.603 --> 02:54.164
he was obviously afraid. And he'd turn around to 
Colonel Henslow and say, John, I am really upset

02:54.184 --> 02:55.866
about that. Talking about it. And that must have 
happened six times, I guess, on

02:57.100 --> 03:06.531
the way out. Oh, it was just the slaps. And so he came 
to Texas A&M. He had practiced

03:11.898 --> 03:17.364
with the Corps. And, well, in short,

03:17.384 --> 03:23.852
he had never seen the University of Texas A&M. And, 
of course, we, and being a military historian, He

03:26.682 --> 03:40.225
was obviously

03:26.682 --> 03:40.225
appreciative of the fact that it was a different 
institution. I don't really know what he saw in the

03:40.245 --> 03:50.563
center because we were very ill-formed at that 
time and I think that might have been attractive to

03:40.245 --> 03:50.563
him because I think he feels and felt and feels very 
keenly about about the need to train bright young

03:50.881 --> 03:57.231
people to do so. And of course he has his own 
standards and his own methodology for doing that.

04:06.104 --> 04:13.635
And so I think he saw here a chance to help shape 
something that would fit the way he thinks. It

04:14.256 --> 04:20.145
turns out that the philosophy that we have and that 
he has are very similar. And

04:20.800 --> 04:45.716
him, I guess,

04:20.800 --> 04:45.716
would probably be

04:20.800 --> 04:45.716
more charitable than that and say that John's view 
as a real genuine Soviet expert has colored my view

04:20.800 --> 04:45.716
of how Soviet studies ought to be done. There's no 
question about it. And so, yeah, I think we have at

04:46.337 --> 04:49.862
least in part been shaped by John. So he, so then he 
went back, on his way back through

04:50.922 --> 05:07.481
Washington, he went to the Pentagon. And he said, I 
want to work with the people in the Pentagon. And he

05:11.125 --> 05:11.966
said, I want to work for Texas A&M. Well, it was an 
incredible coup for us, you see. He was a guy with a

05:12.967 --> 05:13.928
well-established reputation. It's so 
important. All

05:15.104 --> 05:38.259
of a sudden, all of his publications that he 
publishes in the United States came through us.

05:38.279 --> 05:39.642
So, going on the Center for Strategic Technology 
with John Erickson. So, we were able to ride John's

05:39.662 --> 05:41.104
coattails into the Sonia Research Group. Now, I 
don't, I should add, it has been a somewhat stormy

05:41.124 --> 05:42.546
relationship. John does not know the

05:43.420 --> 05:51.229
meaning of the word deadline. The only time he 
worries about money is when he doesn't have

05:52.751 --> 05:58.918
any. He's eccentric,

05:58.938 --> 06:09.850
difficult to get along with, and so it's been a 
turbulent relationship. John's reputation,

06:10.842 --> 06:25.621
although he has a reputation as a tremendous 
scholar, there are other aspects of his

06:10.842 --> 06:25.621
reputation that are not good. He is well known for 
committing himself to go to a conference to

06:25.641 --> 06:33.091
present a paper. I'm not sure of that. For making 
commitments, and in defense of John, he will not

06:34.473 --> 06:38.318
say no. And he and I now have become

06:38.872 --> 06:53.549
close enough friends where I can chastise him and 
say, John, God damn it, you must learn to say no.

06:53.569 --> 06:55.051
It's unfair for you to tell people you'll do 
something and then not do it. Quite, quite. You're

06:55.812 --> 07:01.859
right, Nick. And of course, it just, you know, 
things hit one ear and out the other. But, you know,

07:06.024 --> 07:06.685
looking back, So I think it

07:08.015 --> 07:18.985
has been a very positive relationship for us. But 
there have been some sponsors that, because John

07:19.286 --> 07:30.596
has promised to deliver and hasn't, that we get, to 
some extent, we get tired of that rush, too. So

07:30.616 --> 07:34.680
while it hasn't been a totally positive 
relationship, I think it's over. But he'll be

07:36.787 --> 07:42.275
here, hopefully, the setting's coming over in 
October. And if it's not then, I'm sure he'll be

07:42.295 --> 07:44.839
here by January. And I hope you get

07:44.859 --> 07:51.669
a chance to meet him. He's incredible. As I say, I 
think he has an understanding of the Soviet

07:52.050 --> 08:02.405
military very

07:52.050 --> 08:02.405
well. He's quite a guy. Are there any other things 
you'd like to add about him? No,

08:04.765 --> 08:31.201
I think I probably related the essence of them all.

08:31.221 --> 08:34.485
It's been, as far as I'm concerned, if Dick Thomas 
has had any success in this world, and whatever

08:36.170 --> 09:01.077
success lies ahead of me yet,

08:36.170 --> 09:01.077
that will be due in large part to T.S., which is 
undoubted, and to Harry Whitmore, and to Fred

08:36.170 --> 09:01.077
Benson, and to Skip Ford. Well, Skip and I may have 
different views, but But we agree on enough

09:04.739 --> 09:21.323
things, you know, that it'll go on. We're embarked 
on a new program now aimed at trying to get Texas

09:21.343 --> 09:31.157
A&M in a central position in this renaissance of 
space that is occurring now. And if that, if we're

09:31.177 --> 09:33.160
successful there, it will be because of you.

09:42.269 --> 09:52.221
I don't know that I could add

09:42.269 --> 09:52.221
much more.

09:55.725 --> 10:07.659
I

09:55.725 --> 10:07.659
wish that TEAS had a little bit better 
relationship with the Research Foundation. I

10:07.679 --> 10:09.441
think they don't often appreciate What a 
tremendous asset the foundation

10:10.417 --> 10:22.275
is. The foundation's role has changed quite a lot 
over the last 20 years. And a lot of people

10:26.180 --> 10:40.221
believe, because

10:26.180 --> 10:40.221
government research has changed a lot over the 
last 20 years, just the legal aspects of a contract

10:26.180 --> 10:40.221
with the government is incredibly more complex 
today than it was 20 years ago. And

10:40.808 --> 11:04.176
other things like, you know, affirmative action 
and all of that sort of thing that

10:40.808 --> 11:04.176
administratively has to be taken care of in the 
foundation of that. So I'm not sure the T's – I don't

11:04.196 --> 11:07.440
think the relationship between the T's and the 
foundation – in years past, it used to be like that,

11:04.196 --> 11:07.440
and now it's more like this.

11:13.732 --> 11:33.775
But I hope that teas can...

11:13.732 --> 11:33.775
Two things that I hope for

11:13.732 --> 11:33.775
teas, I guess. Forgive me if I'm airing dirty linen 
here, or washing dirty linen here. Not quite in

11:41.440 --> 11:43.743
public, but I guess almost.

11:47.467 --> 12:05.149
As you're probably aware, back when Benson was 
both dean and head of TEAS, there was a lot more

11:47.467 --> 12:05.149
congruence in the operations of the College of 
Engineering and the Engineering Experiment

11:47.467 --> 12:05.149
Station than there was since Dr. Page came in. 
Again, you can't fault what Dr.

12:17.058 --> 12:18.340
Page wanted to do. But he wanted the College of 
Engineering to go in one direction, and Dr. Porter

12:18.360 --> 12:26.234
wanted it to go in another direction. And so we're 
now in a position now, as a guy who has principally

12:26.254 --> 12:33.807
teased,

12:26.254 --> 12:33.807
I don't It doesn't constrain my activities, but I 
know from my colleagues in aerospace engineering

12:34.428 --> 12:52.087
and in other departments that this dichotomy has 
caused us unsure that hell, frankly, in the past

12:34.428 --> 12:52.087
five years. Dr. Page wanted people to publish in 
the scholarly journals. He saw his primary

12:55.531 --> 13:03.600
mission as raising the scholarly image of the 
College of Engineering. And God knows you can find

13:03.620 --> 13:04.401
that on him. However,

13:05.950 --> 13:22.447
when you have 500 faculty members and you have guys 
that haven't done that, it's sort of like a reprise

13:05.950 --> 13:22.447
on the situation we had back, you know, in the early 
60s when we had department heads who were not

13:05.950 --> 13:22.447
research oriented. Which is not to say they're not 
good guys, you know, like Al Crump and Samad and the

13:23.308 --> 13:29.194
rest of them. But they were just trying to do things 
that those guys weren't equipped to handle. And so

13:36.258 --> 13:39.903
Dr. Page wanted 500 faculty members to get in 
lockstep doing published research, scholarly

13:39.963 --> 13:49.415
research. And we have guys that were hired 
principally to teach. They were hired because

13:54.221 --> 14:00.188
they were great teachers, because they had a lot of 
industrial experience. And preparing people for

14:00.208 --> 14:05.455
industry is still, I think, a major objective of 
the college. Skip

14:06.818 --> 14:13.185
Porter is a very applied guy. He wants... See, 
TEAS, again, as you've probably been told, the

14:13.205 --> 14:26.578
Austin, that is the state view of TEAS, is that of an 
economic development agency. It is not an

14:26.598 --> 14:30.142
educational function. A lot of people don't 
realize that. Well, that says Tease is going to do

14:32.114 --> 14:42.124
not necessarily a whole bunch of scholarly 
research.

14:42.885 --> 14:56.318
And given Dr. Porter's industrial experience and 
having spent time at TI and so forth, he has a

14:42.885 --> 14:56.318
different view of the world than Dr. Page has. Here 
are these poor faculty members, and they don't

14:58.169 --> 15:03.477
know which guy to follow. And Page controls their 
promotion and tenure, and Dr. Porter controls the

15:03.497 --> 15:15.134
seed money for their research.

15:15.154 --> 15:18.940
We have 16 open positions in the Department of 
Electrical Engineering. Sixteen! Now you know

15:23.226 --> 15:24.328
why.

15:27.633 --> 15:31.338
That's going to change. The new super dean, 
whoever he is, hopefully will weld this thing back

15:31.358 --> 15:42.631
together into the unit it once was under Mr. 
Benson. When I came here

15:42.692 --> 15:52.003
and was a department member in aerospace 
engineering, there was no between what Ortiz

15:52.591 --> 15:59.900
wanted me to do and what the department wanted me to 
do. They were exactly congruent.

16:04.606 --> 16:10.133
And that's why it was such a beautiful,

16:04.606 --> 16:10.133
beautiful song. Now it's not. Somehow, someway, 
we've got

16:12.576 --> 16:18.003
to get back to that. And this is not oral history, I 
think. It will be. Pardon me? It will be. Well,

16:23.819 --> 16:25.621
hopefully sometime. It'll be interesting to see 
how it turns out, whether or not either or not. You

16:29.888 --> 16:32.011
know, maybe it's irreversible. I mean, maybe we 
can get

16:32.391 --> 16:37.219
back to one. I don't know. All I can say is that the 
relationship between Pease and the College of

16:39.282 --> 16:47.674
Engineering today is not what it was five years 
ago.

16:50.708 --> 16:54.091
And I don't know. Maybe if you look at the 
legislation that set up TEAS back in 2014,

16:54.151 --> 17:06.162
was it? As Dr. Porter said, we are the Texas 
Engineering Experiment Station. We are not the

17:13.709 --> 17:17.792
Texas A&M Experiment Station.

17:17.812 --> 17:18.333
And that says volumes. TEAS is here to serve the 
state. Well,

17:20.510 --> 17:29.179
I don't know. It may never ever be like it was 
before.

17:37.949 --> 17:39.150
Quite like it was before. I kind of hope it will be 
because I think TEAS has been and can be the way by

17:39.170 --> 17:50.162
which we can get our young people in.

17:55.745 --> 18:24.064
And, I mean, if you, you know, if we're in a 
situation where TEAS is like Southwest Research

17:55.745 --> 18:24.064
Institute, or Mattel, or, you know, going off its 
own very way, sort of maybe housed here on the Texas

17:55.745 --> 18:24.064
A&M campus, but really having very little to do 
with Texas A&M as such, or relatively little to do,

18:25.664 --> 18:32.411
then the College of Engineering is going to be like 
Georgia Tech was with me. They're not going to have

18:32.431 --> 18:38.898
any

18:32.431 --> 18:38.898
money to work with. And when a young guy comes in and 
says, well, do you have money for promoting

18:38.918 --> 18:43.763
research? They'll say, yeah, you can take that out 
of your research money, like Georgia Tech told me.

18:50.010 --> 18:50.891
And that ain't going to fly. That's not going to 
wash. So TEAS has been, I think, an enormous

18:56.933 --> 19:09.687
contributor to the growth of the university. I 
think, unquestionably, the fact that we have the

19:09.787 --> 19:18.897
largest college of engineering in the country 
here is due to TEAS. It's due, and TEAS has

19:18.917 --> 19:26.586
supported the evolution of the research program 
that has drawn Texas A&M a tremendous amount of

19:27.545 --> 19:33.193
respect. Of course, we've always had that very, 
very strong undergraduate research program, and

19:33.213 --> 19:50.598
young people, I think, across the state of Texas 
still perceive a degree in engineering from Texas

19:33.213 --> 19:50.598
A&M to be a significant step up the ladder of 
success. I think we're still, locally, that is,

19:54.157 --> 20:01.805
within the state, I think our undergraduate 
education program is highly revered.

20:04.027 --> 20:06.830
And I don't want to sacrifice that. I think we need 
to hang on to that. So I don't want to tease

20:10.834 --> 20:21.345
to do anything that would weaken that image. I

20:23.435 --> 20:26.980
don't know. It seems to me that there are people on 
up in the university who are prepared to sacrifice

20:27.040 --> 20:42.061
that in order to achieve greatness,

20:27.040 --> 20:42.061
whatever that is. That we will become like MIT in 
the sense of having a pedestrian undergraduate

20:43.002 --> 20:48.970
program. with a heavy focus

20:49.777 --> 21:03.077
on Nobel Prize winners and scholarly 
publications and all kinds of highfalutin

20:49.777 --> 21:03.077
research.

21:03.097 --> 21:08.585
I think we have to remember that we are a land-grant 
institution. We were established, like all other

21:08.605 --> 21:19.041
land-grant schools, prior to the enactment of the 
Morrill Act back in 2018. higher

21:20.270 --> 21:27.577
education was the province of the wealthy. And 
unless you were affluent, you just couldn't get a

21:27.837 --> 21:38.147
higher education, and that's what the land grant 
schools were intended to do, to bring education to

21:27.837 --> 21:38.147
the masses. And I'll be damned if I see any need to 
turn away from that. I don't feel badly. I mean, if I

21:44.193 --> 21:49.078
want to be a highfalutin guy, I'll go to Caltech or 
MIT. And I just don't understand why

21:49.784 --> 22:05.909
some of our administration has to

21:49.784 --> 22:05.909
drive us away from that. How many MITs do we need? I 
think one's enough, really.

22:15.603 --> 22:19.909
So I think we have contributed greatly to the 
state. I think that the T's unquestionably, T's

22:20.109 --> 22:37.894
support and actions have undergirded the 
contribution that we've made to the state of Texas

22:20.109 --> 22:37.894
and to the nation. And I just,

22:37.914 --> 22:45.424
I said maybe it is time to move on to some higher 
plateau. Maybe this is what you're hearing is just

22:46.282 --> 22:58.041
the bleeding of a guy who's out of it, whose views 
are passe. That could well be, I suppose. Maybe I

23:03.410 --> 23:11.243
long for the good old saying,

23:03.410 --> 23:11.243
of course, they say you can never go back. Maybe 
there is some sort of a new relationship out there,

23:11.712 --> 23:26.769
a new framework in which T's can function 
effectively. Could well be. But if that means

23:30.053 --> 23:37.922
sacrificing what we have accomplished in the 
past, if it means destroying the strengths on

23:39.623 --> 23:45.128
which this institution has been built. I guess I'm 
reluctant

23:45.148 --> 23:51.053
to do that. I don't see that it needs to be done. I 
don't see why you have to destroy

23:53.034 --> 24:05.305
something in

23:53.034 --> 24:05.305
order to achieve something else. Maybe you have 
to, but I don't see that. So I think TEAS has been an

24:06.385 --> 24:09.428
absolutely great institution. in terms of what 
it's done for the nation, for the state, for the

24:10.842 --> 24:27.463
university, and of course

24:10.842 --> 24:27.463
for Dick Thomas. I think that it may be necessary to 
change the road that we're on, the path that we're

24:28.685 --> 24:40.039
on, and we're going to continue to provide that.

24:44.491 --> 24:47.195
Well, I don't know. Obviously, my admiration and 
respect of tea is unbounded, because I've been

24:48.457 --> 25:12.152
fortunate enough to have been a part

24:48.457 --> 25:12.152
of it in its formative years, shall we say, when it 
really grew and really blossomed.

25:16.030 --> 25:37.416
I kind of wish that other institutions could see 
what TEAS has done for Texas A&M and for the state

25:16.030 --> 25:37.416
and could learn from that and maybe replicate it in 
some form or other. Because I think it can serve

25:37.436 --> 25:43.303
other states as well as it has served Texas. With 
the proper leadership, and again, I'm not

25:44.296 --> 26:09.561
going to raise the point, it obviously has to have

25:44.296 --> 26:09.561
a good view of the kind of contribution that it can 
make and the kind of strengths that it has to have to

25:44.296 --> 26:09.561
make this contribution. So with proper 
leadership, I think that TEAS and other states

26:11.802 --> 26:26.509
could be as

26:11.802 --> 26:26.509
effective as it has been doing. So then it wouldn't 
be TEAS, it would be EES, whatever. Kansas, I

26:27.671 --> 26:28.753
think. Well,

26:28.773 --> 26:33.642
thank you for all your time.
