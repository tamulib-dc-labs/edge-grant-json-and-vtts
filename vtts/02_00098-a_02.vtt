WEBVTT

00:02.697 --> 00:07.182
Was that a jeweler downtown or was it on, where was 
he? This was in Bryan. In Bryan, in Bryan. How often

00:10.606 --> 00:15.051
did you and your buddies go to Bryan when you were a 
student? Oh, not too often, but some, yes. And how

00:20.677 --> 00:21.638
did you get there? They had a trolley. Went by 
trolley. Do you remember what it cost? I think it

00:29.393 --> 00:32.436
cost a nickel. It didn't cost much because if it 
cost more than a nickel, I don't think I'd have made

00:32.456 --> 00:36.380
it. And it ran every hour or so? Yeah, it ran, yeah. 
And what was there in downtown Bryan for an Aggie

00:42.226 --> 00:46.991
that was interesting? Movies.

00:51.496 --> 00:55.840
Movies and going to a restaurant. Getting 
whatever you can buy. Do you remember seeing any

00:58.956 --> 01:02.864
movies down there that made an impression on you? 
Were there some special? Oh, I don't remember. I

01:07.273 --> 01:08.134
don't remember. Let's see. Were there still some 
silent movies? Oh, sure, because sound didn't

01:12.142 --> 01:15.569
come in. The first sound came in in 1927. That's 
what I... And there was silent movies up to that

01:19.327 --> 01:22.751
time. And the first movie with sound, it was Al 
Jolson. And then after that, of course, you had

01:30.581 --> 01:33.044
sound. Do you remember seeing that? Did you see 
that one? I saw that one, yes. What did you think of

01:36.829 --> 01:38.391
it? Well, I thought it was great. You sit there, and 
all of a sudden, you hear voices. from a movie. It

01:48.216 --> 01:51.199
was really something. To me, it was a great, great 
development. How many students had a radio then?

01:59.308 --> 02:00.489
Oh, I think most of them. Really? Oh, yeah. Radio 
was prevalent. And you listened to WTAW and what

02:04.473 --> 02:08.117
other stations? I listened to whatever station 
they went to. There was one station I used to listen

02:10.620 --> 02:13.583
to, and that was What's his name? Godfrey? 
Godfrey? Godfrey played the Hawaiian music all

02:21.934 --> 02:27.139
the time. And at that time it was microwave. And he 
was in Hawaii. Relay the music and it'll fade in and

02:35.627 --> 02:41.613
fade out. Fade in and fade out. Wasn't clear. Your 
freshman year, did you go home Thanksgiving? I

02:50.462 --> 02:52.184
went home Christmas. Christmas. How did you get 
home? Well, most of the time, I thought my way home.

02:57.933 --> 02:59.515
Describe Aggie hitchhiking. What was it like? 
Well, there'd be more than one trying to

03:02.159 --> 03:09.009
hitchhike, and we separated about 200 yards. 
Everybody had a chance. Did you wear a uniform? Oh,

03:13.132 --> 03:17.792
absolutely, that's the only way that people will 
stop. They knew Aggies. They knew Aggies with

03:19.351 --> 03:21.494
uniforms on, you know. They were the same people 
driving up and down the highways in the trucks and

03:21.955 --> 03:41.565
mostly, and I've ridden many times in a truck that 
was being delivered someplace and that they'll

03:21.955 --> 03:41.565
take me halfway or the quarter way or to Houston and 
then I'd go on the road and try to get all the way into

03:21.955 --> 03:41.565
Bowman. Did you ever have any bad Aggie 
hitchhiking experience? No, never did. This is

03:48.077 --> 03:51.220
number 204 of the interviews. I have yet to hear a 
single bad hitchhiking experience. Everybody

03:56.806 --> 04:03.053
says, sometimes did the guy drive a little too fast 
or maybe drink a little too much? I never had any

04:04.835 --> 04:06.617
experience. Of course, I didn't make as many trips 
as some of them made. Because I stayed here and I

04:11.682 --> 04:13.564
worked. What did you tell your parents and your 
friends that first Christmas about being an

04:14.067 --> 04:20.377
Aggie? What did you tell them? I couldn't tell my 
mother much. She wanted to know why my rear end was

04:24.744 --> 04:29.992
so bloody and everything else. And that was the 
whole talk the whole time I was there. She just felt

04:33.037 --> 04:35.401
like I was in the wrong place. And she was the one who 
really wanted me to go to college. And she just

04:40.831 --> 04:51.846
would save a dollar here, 50 cents or whatever it 
is, and try to send it to me whenever she possibly

04:40.831 --> 04:51.846
could. She was a great mother. About how much did it 
cost a full year then? Do you have any idea to go to

04:57.294 --> 05:02.220
A&M?

05:02.240 --> 05:05.204
I think that less than $200. And about how much did 
you earn and how much did your family give you? Oh,

05:10.953 --> 05:13.537
my family. My mother would give me maybe $4 or $5 a 
month. That's just shit saved. We were poor. We

05:22.612 --> 05:23.454
were very poor. And the grocery store was just 
making enough to to keep us alive, you might say.

05:37.173 --> 05:43.881
And there was no way that my family could have sent 
me to college. No way. I can identify with some of

05:45.023 --> 05:54.234
this because nobody in either of my parents' 
families had ever finished high school before me.

05:54.835 --> 05:55.776
My parents didn't. But they always said, you're 
going to go to college. You're going to go to

05:58.827 --> 06:00.771
college. My mother supported me too. My daddy, he 
was a good man, but he was striving, working so hard

06:03.355 --> 06:13.152
to keep the family together and everything. He 
felt like that we ought to work in the store and help

06:13.974 --> 06:17.019
them. Did your brothers and sisters go to college? 
My older brother didn't. My other brothers did.

06:25.926 --> 06:29.670
And I helped one of them get a degree out of Tulane. 
He was a wonderful doctor. Oh, great. And he was the

06:32.573 --> 06:35.636
first of the brothers to die. Did you ever think 
about leaving A&M and going somewhere else? No, I

06:41.743 --> 06:45.907
should say not. When I came to A&M and I got that $50 I 
would have done anything for A&M. Anything,

06:53.119 --> 06:54.761
anything. At Christmas, then, you go home and 
you're coming back. Did the hazing slow down the

06:59.867 --> 07:03.632
second semester for freshmen? Somewhat, because 
if I remember, one of the freshmen had a hurt, his

07:04.833 --> 07:14.565
spine was damaged. And I really led a contingent 
because I did everything I possibly could to stop

07:16.283 --> 07:28.091
that hazing. When you finished your freshman 
year, what did you do that summer after your

07:28.231 --> 07:35.187
freshman year? I went to Beaumont and I worked in 
the oil refinery, hauling coke. They'd have this

07:41.793 --> 07:46.261
coke and they liked to haul it and put it on 
gondolas. I'd get out just black, and they'd pay

07:47.102 --> 07:51.509
you so much an hour. I worked in the oil fields. 
After the second boom, it spilt up. I'd carry

07:57.379 --> 07:59.503
buckets. But fresh water buckets in each hand and 
carry them to people on the rig on the derrick

07:59.483 --> 08:06.714
floor. And they paid me 50 cents. 50 cents? 50 cents 
a day. Oh, a day. For the afternoon. Oh, I thought

08:15.727 --> 08:16.969
you were going to say an hour. No, no, they paid me 50 
cents. Now, Beaumont was a boontown then, wasn't

08:19.793 --> 08:22.217
it? Well, they had a boom town in 1901. Yes. When the 
film town came in on the Superdome structure. But

08:30.747 --> 08:33.189
on the flake, that was 1925. That's what I thought. 
I was still in high school. So there was a second

08:36.914 --> 08:38.155
boom. A second boom. And you came back then as a 
sophomore. How much better was it to be an Aggie

08:43.421 --> 08:49.768
sophomore than it was to be an Aggie freshman? 
Well, a hell of a lot better. a lot better you you

08:52.657 --> 09:19.795
just don't realize some of the things that the 
hazing that took place there were dropouts there

08:52.657 --> 09:19.795
was some that went home i couldn't take it but i took 
it regardless of what it was because i wanted this i

08:52.657 --> 09:19.795
wanted the education i was determined i was going 
to be a geoscientist and i was going to do it Now did

09:20.500 --> 09:28.823
you think that you were going to be a scholar, a 
geoscience scholar, or that you were going to go

09:20.500 --> 09:28.823
into the business world? No, I wanted to get my 
degree. I got my bachelor's degree. Then I went

09:36.393 --> 09:56.290
back and got my master's degree because Dr. 
Lonsdale, who was head of the science department

09:36.393 --> 09:56.290
and all, had made arrangements with the United 
States Geological Survey to do some work in the

09:36.393 --> 09:56.290
Winter Garden area, which was near

09:36.393 --> 09:56.290
the valley. And so he asked me to be his assistant. 
Oh, good. And so they paid me a few dollars to work

10:00.157 --> 10:10.175
and write up the papers and things of that kind. And 
I got my master's degree by working the geology out

10:10.817 --> 10:17.068
of Scotia County. As a sophomore, did you have jobs 
the same way as you had as a freshman? Oh, yes, I

10:22.565 --> 10:24.046
worked the same way. I worked the same way I did 
through my junior year, and then during my junior

10:25.428 --> 10:38.623
year, the class elected me as editor of the 
Longhorn. I always wondered why it was called a

10:38.643 --> 10:45.891
Longhorn, and I recommended that it be changed to 
the Aggieland, and it finally was. And the word

10:45.972 --> 10:48.836
Longhorn was two words, wasn't it? No, no. Oh, 
originally it was two. Longhorn. Originally it

10:51.619 --> 10:53.562
was two words. I don't remember that. Well, back in 
the 1890s. Where were the offices for the

10:58.728 --> 11:00.951
Longhorn? In Milner. In Milner Hall? Milner. My 
junior year, I was in Milner. I think I was in Milner

11:09.141 --> 11:12.646
both years, junior and senior. Now, had you done 
any... work like that before in high school? No,

11:19.400 --> 11:20.502
no. It just came natural to me. My business manager 
was Quack Porter. Quack Porter. Yeah, they called

11:31.858 --> 11:34.302
him Quack. Where was he from? Do you remember?

11:42.098 --> 11:47.764
I don't, but I thought about him the other day and I 
said, I'm gonna get in touch with Quack. I could

11:47.784 --> 11:49.206
find out. Terrell, Texas? I know where that is, 
east of Dallas. I think it's Terrell. What was your

11:55.632 --> 11:56.613
nickname? Mike. No other than Mike. It's Mike. 
Michelle is my name. Yes, sir, I know. Were you Mike

12:03.681 --> 12:07.004
in high school or were you Michelle in high school? 
Both. Both? The teachers called me Michelle. And

12:11.478 --> 12:16.786
the students, some called me Michelle. The girls 
called me Michelle, but the boys called me Mike.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.597
They didn't like the name Michelle. Back to the 
Longhorn, about how many other students worked

12:24.759 --> 12:29.907
with you on the Longhorn staff? Oh, I had, oh, maybe 
25. and uh longhorn when when you were elected

12:35.339 --> 13:03.439
editor and business manager you had to raise the 
money and how did you raise it quack and i bought a

12:35.339 --> 13:03.439
car for 75 dollars an old star the name of a star 
didn't have a top oh dilapidated car and so we took

12:35.339 --> 13:03.439
that we toured toured the state Raising money? We 
may have raised money. We had to, otherwise we

13:06.321 --> 13:08.503
couldn't get the book. The school didn't give us a 
dime, not one dime. How much did you all raise? We

13:16.734 --> 13:23.662
raised enough to publish it, and I think it was 
pretty close to $10,000, if I'm not mistaken. Wow,

13:23.682 --> 13:24.884
that's a lot of money. Our biggest contributor was 
Zachary. H.B. Zachary?

13:33.237 --> 13:34.499
The greatest contributor. There. That's his 
picture, but it's on the John. That's Mr.

13:39.868 --> 13:41.210
Zachary's picture. Yeah. We walked in and he said, 
what are you going to do? I said, well, you know

13:48.423 --> 13:51.207
about this, Mr. Zachary. You've been to A&M. You 
know what the yearbook is. School doesn't give us a

13:55.635 --> 13:56.977
dime. We've got to raise the money ourselves. And 
we did everything. We went from one place to the

14:02.675 --> 14:09.826
other, and we solicited, and we met people that we 
would have never met before. And sometimes we were

14:10.728 --> 14:16.096
hungry, and we didn't spend money to really eat. I 
remember one time we were coming back from San

14:16.737 --> 14:21.705
Antonio, we passed some watermelon

14:24.284 --> 14:27.108
I said, quack, let's go in there and get the 
watermelon. He said, oh, hell no, we may be shot. I

14:31.034 --> 14:31.995
said, I'm hungry. They said the watermelon was 
close to the road. I said, well, I'm going in there

14:37.564 --> 14:41.129
and get the watermelon. He said, no, you better 
watch out. So anyway, I jumped over the fence and

14:42.751 --> 14:46.497
got a watermelon. We bursted it open, and that was 
our meal for the day, I think. Who else was truly

14:51.149 --> 14:54.813
helpful other than Mr. Zachary? Were there some 
others? Oh yeah, we got,

14:56.155 --> 15:07.369
I don't remember names, but Dallas, we had a lot of 
help in Dallas. Amarillo,

15:09.752 --> 15:14.878
Beaumont, Corpus Christi. And that area helped us 
a lot, and the valley. Where did you get the idea for

15:21.836 --> 15:26.302
that marvelous artwork that you put in that? Do you 
know? I'm glad you brought it up because that's the

15:27.203 --> 15:32.990
greatest piece of artwork that was ever in any 
annual. Did you know that it won All-America

15:33.050 --> 15:35.453
Prize? It was considered the best annual of any 
annual for that year in the whole country.

15:46.550 --> 15:52.838
I thought that looking into the future, and I got 
this, Mr. Dr. Geiss. He was associated with the

15:54.160 --> 15:57.084
architecture department. G-E-I-S-S? G-E-I-S. 
S. I think that's the spelling. And I said, I said,

16:03.753 --> 16:09.520
now look, Dr. Geiss, I want, this is the idea I have. 
I said, someday they're going to be planes flying

16:09.541 --> 16:14.447
all over the place. I said, we want to build 
high-rise buildings, connect them. And I said, we

16:21.677 --> 16:33.054
also want to build a landing place in the middle of 
the ocean so that planes can leave the United

16:21.677 --> 16:33.054
States, land, get gasoline, and move on. Have you 
seen that book? Mm-hmm. Now, who did the art? He

16:40.886 --> 16:41.326
did. Oh, Professor Geist did. Professor Geist, he 
had a... He had two helpers, I can't remember their

16:45.460 --> 16:47.705
name. Students. That's beautiful work. Oh, yes. 
There'd be nothing like it. Nothing. Did he? Even

16:56.643 --> 17:05.781
to this day, from 1930 to this day, no annual ever 
came close. Now, did he get any pay for that, or did

17:06.352 --> 17:10.236
he donate all of it? No, no, this was all volunteer. 
The money that we got, we paid for expenses. We had

17:19.987 --> 17:23.371
to have this, we had to have that, we had to have 
typewriters. The school didn't give us anything.

17:26.494 --> 17:28.276
Where was it printed? It was printed in Jefferson 
City, Missouri. Really? Yes. Because, see, I was

17:35.140 --> 17:39.926
chancellor of the University of Missouri after I 
left here and came back four years ago. That's why

17:39.966 --> 17:44.152
I'll have to check on the company. Jefferson City, 
Missouri. My, my, my. Because the Aggieland today

17:47.036 --> 17:53.464
is being printed by a company up in North Missouri. 
Yeah. They're very, very big in that. It might have

17:56.348 --> 17:57.930
been the same company. Oh, that's what I'm going to 
check. Do you remember how many copies you all

17:59.352 --> 18:01.755
printed? Enough for all the student body. So it 
would have been 2,000 plus. Whatever it was. I

18:06.935 --> 18:14.293
think my class was around 2,100. Who did the 
photography? all of us so different people yes i

18:14.847 --> 18:39.353
had a camera a quack had a camera and i designated 
some of them to do go go get pictures here go get

18:14.847 --> 18:39.353
pictures of the military go get pictures of the 
athletic program things like that were there any

18:14.847 --> 18:39.353
faculty advisors none none it's remarkable that 
here was something so important for the

18:40.160 --> 18:44.705
university at that time, the college. And there 
was no help of any kind from the faculty or from the

18:46.127 --> 18:54.696
officers of the institution. And I'm

18:55.397 --> 19:06.910
trying to think

18:55.397 --> 19:06.910
who was there.

19:09.674 --> 19:11.636
Chairman of the Board of Regents. Wait a minute, 
look at me.

19:21.808 --> 19:23.590
I'm sure I don't know that one. Anyway, I went to 
him. And I told him, I said, how in the world can this

19:27.134 --> 19:35.684
college want a yearbook? They needed a yearbook, 
and there's no help. I said, maybe next year you're

19:40.657 --> 19:46.263
not going to get somebody as enterprising as Hal 
Booney and Porter. Maybe they won't be able to go

19:47.445 --> 19:49.387
get the money. What are you going to do? Now when did 
y'all make that fundraising trip? Was it during

19:55.134 --> 19:56.115
the summer? During the summer, between the junior 
and senior years. You were elected while you were a

20:00.600 --> 20:03.644
junior. Now had you worked on the yearbook as a 
junior? No, I did a little photography

20:08.753 --> 20:29.995
and then I'd go into the office and I

20:08.753 --> 20:29.995
think the editor

20:08.753 --> 20:29.995
of the one before that was Puryear. Was it Puryear 
or do you know? Now did somebody recommend you? Or

20:37.660 --> 20:40.243
did you just kind of say, hey, I'd like to do this? It 
was a surprise to me. Oh, really? Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

20:45.990 --> 21:00.226
The president of the class came to me and told me 
that I was elected to be editor, and Quack Porter

20:45.990 --> 21:00.226
was elected to be business manager. And I said, 
gee, my nanny. I said, where are we going to get the

21:02.329 --> 21:03.630
money? He told me, you get it. And because you had 
not been on the high school paper. No. And you sure

21:11.315 --> 21:13.117
didn't plan to be a journalist. No. I guess they 
watched me work and they figured we needed

21:15.880 --> 21:21.266
somebody who could work. When did, about what time 
of the year did y'all turn in all of the copy? Every

21:27.493 --> 21:28.134
day. Right, and when did you turn in the last? Oh, A 
few weeks before. And it was ready for

21:37.554 --> 21:41.839
distribution when? By the time you graduated? It 
was ready for distribution, I think, two or three

21:43.481 --> 21:48.867
weeks before graduation. Everybody got a copy. 
You see, that was another thing that bothered me,

21:51.310 --> 22:04.485
is that we raised all that money to put out the 
yearbook, and there were no charge for it. We gave

22:06.372 --> 22:10.558
it to

22:06.372 --> 22:10.558
them. And I think today you pay for it, don't you? 
Oh, yes, yes. Every student pays a fee. Yeah. The

22:18.388 --> 22:27.922
biggest yearbook in the United States in size and 
in number of copies today is the Aggieland. Well,

22:27.942 --> 22:28.763
it should be. Well, I agree. But see, many other 
campuses now, the yearbook is going away. Yeah. Do

22:36.038 --> 22:41.727
you remember where they set up to make the 
photographs of the individual students?

22:45.213 --> 22:50.903
We had a place there.

22:50.923 --> 22:51.724
I don't remember. I think it was one of the halls. 
And in the first Longhorns, seniors wore tuxedos.

23:02.060 --> 23:04.643
Y'all wore your uniforms, didn't you? Yes, 
everybody wore uniforms. See, you've got to

23:06.786 --> 23:15.416
remember that everybody, every student except 
the casuals, were in uniform. Did you, by chance,

23:15.436 --> 23:18.880
meet Buck Shewitz back in those years? Oh, yeah. 
Please describe what... I loved Buck. He was a

23:23.366 --> 23:24.587
great guy. He was a great person. See, he had been 
the art editor of the yearbook in 21. And that one

23:32.468 --> 23:38.001
is, next to yours, that one is the best art of any 
yearbook here. When my co-author, Jim Clark, and I

23:39.063 --> 23:49.026
wrote Spittletop, and we wore the dust jackets. So 
I went to Buck and I told him we want a jacket for this

23:50.491 --> 23:58.785
book and he delivered it. And if you ever get a copy 
of Spittletop and you look at that dust jacket,

23:59.886 --> 24:05.455
that's Shewitz. Make believe that I didn't know 
Buck and I knew him well. Describe Buck Shewitz. I

24:11.720 --> 24:23.714
knew him enough to know that he was a compassionate 
man and full of artistic ideas. He loved this work.

24:25.096 --> 24:26.037
Oh yes, oh yes. And he loved this school. Oh yes. His 
drawings should be made a permanent

24:40.289 --> 24:41.811
part of this university. Well, there are 24 of them 
downstairs in the main lobby of the MSC all the time

24:41.831 --> 24:47.036
right now. Yeah, I know they've been there, but 
they ought to have something. Oh, yes. They ought

24:51.180 --> 24:59.509
to have a room, something dedicated to him, and 
they started just having them scattered out like

24:51.180 --> 24:59.509
they are. Where did the original for that dust 
jacket, do you have that?

25:07.137 --> 25:08.338
When the book came out, We loaned it to this fellow, 
T.E. Brown, I think that was his initials, of the

25:13.959 --> 25:22.271
Brown Bookstore.

25:22.291 --> 25:29.702
And he had all these books in the window, and he had 
books drawing, showing the jackets.

25:32.146 --> 25:37.671
And then when we wanted him to return it, he 
wouldn't return it. He said somebody stole it.

25:40.173 --> 25:41.615
He's a liar and so and so. If I ever saw anybody, he 
just stole it. That's not fair. Back to the

25:47.880 --> 25:48.781
yearbook. I don't know why I didn't do something 
about it. I don't know why I didn't sue him or

25:52.104 --> 25:54.726
something. When you finished that yearbook, did 
you present a copy to President Walton? Was there a

25:59.731 --> 26:02.153
special occasion? when the yearbook was 
finished?

26:08.494 --> 26:15.122
I

26:08.494 --> 26:15.122
think I probably had it. I think I delivered it to 
the first copy. I'm trying to think of the guy who

26:21.310 --> 26:29.119
was the Board of Regents.

26:33.790 --> 26:39.497
I think the first copy I delivered to one of the 
regents by the name of Law.

26:42.861 --> 26:44.263
I forget his first name. But he was very nice to me. 
And he knew my family circumstances. And he gave me

26:54.976 --> 26:56.878
my first degree. got out of line, gave it to me, did 
the same thing for the second one. Oh, how good, how

27:01.538 --> 27:02.900
good. How easy was it to sell ads to the businesses 
here in Bryan and College? It wasn't easy.

27:15.518 --> 27:21.046
Did y'all have a party for the, when you finished 
it, did y'all celebrate in any way? Oh, Quack and I,

27:24.263 --> 27:29.790
We decided that what we were going to do, pay 
ourselves a little salary.

27:32.273 --> 27:42.104
And I think we paid ourselves about $50 a month, 
which helped a lot. During the years that you were

27:42.124 --> 27:47.571
here, what services did the YMCA provide? What 
happened at the YMCA? Well, they had the

27:51.116 --> 28:01.790
confectionery for one thing, and then they had 
services for the students, and they would give you

27:51.116 --> 28:01.790
some help in every way that they possibly could. 
But then they had a bowling thing in the basement

28:02.871 --> 28:07.997
down below. Was the swimming pool still there? 
Yes, I think it was, yeah. That would have been the

28:16.272 --> 28:18.935
only swimming pool anywhere around, wouldn't it? 
Yeah, it was there. Did you get acquainted with Mr.

28:20.817 --> 28:23.361
Cashin?

28:26.444 --> 28:30.229
That's a name that's a familiar name. Cashin, yes. 
Cashin. He was the first director of the Y. Well,

28:36.116 --> 28:42.043
then I must have known him, the name, when you 
mentioned his name. Yes, yes. And see, Red Cashin,

28:43.591 --> 28:46.636
that's his son. Yes, yes, yes. Did you go to any 
religious events here while you were a student?

28:55.331 --> 28:56.333
Did you go to church?

28:59.839 --> 29:01.963
Well, occasionally I would. Where did you? I'd go 
to the Episcopal Church. At South? We were raised

29:06.762 --> 29:13.909
in the Eastern Orthodox Church. And that's where 
my Sunday school teacher told me the earth was

29:15.411 --> 29:21.437
5,000 years old. So they didn't have any Eastern 
Orthodox Church in this area. So Episcopal

29:28.524 --> 29:36.212
services and rites are the same as practically of 
the others. Were there any Sunday night church

29:36.530 --> 29:42.537
meetings? Not that I remember. Oh, they had 
meetings, but I don't know. Was Religious

29:46.701 --> 29:49.644
Emphasis Week held in that era? In the late 30s, I 
know they had here on the campus one week in the

29:51.126 --> 29:58.754
spring when they would have ministers from all 
denominations come. They probably did, but I

29:58.774 --> 30:01.137
didn't attend those. Describe the typical A&M 
student when you were here. Where was he from? What

30:08.387 --> 30:09.549
kind of income? What were his basic attitudes? The 
average, he was a well-to-do student.

30:20.665 --> 30:21.506
Country or city? Both.

30:27.014 --> 30:30.820
Most of the students here were well-off. And what 
were? There were a group of us that knew each

30:32.475 --> 30:39.392
other's poverty. And we tried to mingle with each 
other because we had the same problems. Problems

30:51.768 --> 30:57.158
at home, problems raising money and everything 
else. And there was this other group that were just

30:57.178 --> 31:00.785
wealthy people. Did those well-to-do boys make 
fun of you poor boys? No, I don't think that ever

31:04.786 --> 31:07.329
took place. I've never heard of that. Did it matter 
where your ancestors came from here at A&M? No, no.

31:18.423 --> 31:20.466
What was it that pulled Aggies together? It was the 
spirit that we realize exists today, the Aggie

31:21.587 --> 31:26.514
spirit. And in that core, when you're in that core 
and everybody in the college was in the core, That

31:35.212 --> 31:37.181
was a fraternity of its own. That's one reason why I 
fought like hell to keep the fraternities from

31:38.266 --> 31:45.036
happening in this university.
