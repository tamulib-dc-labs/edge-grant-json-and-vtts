00:01.820 --> 00:08.754
This is an interview with Brigadier General Gaber 
Kidwell. Today's date is 8 June 1981. This is Terry

00:12.561 --> 00:13.924
Anderson. This is a test in Dallas.

00:20.377 --> 00:22.140
Okay, let's start then. Today's interview is with 
Brigadier General Kidwell. Today is June 8, 1981.

00:28.879 --> 00:33.105
Could you first start out by telling us where and 
when you were born? I was born in Dallas down on the

00:34.047 --> 00:40.716
corner of Ross and Fitchview on February the 4th, 
1910.

00:43.901 --> 00:45.443
Could you tell us about your parents? Let's start 
with your father.

00:50.622 --> 01:01.311
My father was Charles Weems Kidwell, who was born 
in Louisiana, moved to Texas when he was a baby in

00:50.622 --> 01:01.311
arms. And he grew up in Dallas. His mother brought 
him here as a very young widow. Do you remember

01:11.340 --> 01:15.264
approximately when he came to Dallas? In the 1880s 
or 90s?

01:26.144 --> 01:27.706
Well, that's something I have to look up. No, I 
don't. I'm sure it was in the 1880s.

01:42.085 --> 01:53.940
And he went to the schools here in Dallas and then 
attended the Ed Rand Christian College. out of

01:54.207 --> 02:00.675
Thorpe Springs, Texas, which is the forerunner of 
Texas Christian University today. And Mr. Edison

02:00.875 --> 02:19.557
Randall, a private schoolmaster, set this thing 
up in conjunction with some Christian church

02:00.875 --> 02:19.557
endeavors out of Thorpe Springs, which I've been 
there with my father and seen the old ruins of this

02:21.224 --> 02:25.388
school. Did it burn down or did they abandon it? 
Well, I'm sure it burned down and the

02:29.531 --> 02:42.523
Christian church decided to move it to Fort Worth. 
And it's long since been abandoned. Did he have

02:46.787 --> 02:50.050
four years of college education then? No, he did 
not have four years of college education.

02:54.914 --> 03:11.036
Financial hardships entered into the picture, 
and he went to work for Sanger Brothers, a

02:54.914 --> 03:11.036
department store operating in Dallas and Fort 
Worth and in Waco. Mr. Alex Sanger and four German

03:13.199 --> 03:20.188
immigrant brothers owned the store. And they 
employed my father. And he worked there all his

03:24.400 --> 03:29.147
life, all his adult life. A salesman? Well, he 
started out as a salesman and got to be a department

03:31.070 --> 03:36.438
head. And then he got to be assistant manager. And 
then he got to be manager of the Dallas store. And

03:43.648 --> 03:50.378
then he got to be general superintendent of the 
Dallas, the Waco, and the Fort Worth stores. At

03:50.999 --> 03:54.604
that time, it was a very responsible job. No 
kidding. When did he become general

03:57.608 --> 03:59.611
superintendent? When about was that?

04:06.140 --> 04:19.538
I'm sure this was in the 1925

04:06.140 --> 04:19.538
era, somewhere in there.

04:21.104 --> 04:23.127
I was just starting in high school. I started high 
school in 1924. So in that area. So he was in a

04:29.597 --> 04:33.002
management or a leadership position also? He was 
in management, right.

04:39.231 --> 04:50.908
Because of his job and because he had two young 
sons, he was not in the World War I. whether they

04:51.648 --> 05:00.380
drafted him in those days or whether he got exempt 
or what the story is. I don't know, but he was not in

05:00.400 --> 05:03.023
the army. Could you describe him? What did he look 
like? What kind of personality or character was

05:06.428 --> 05:08.551
he? Well, he was very

05:08.571 --> 05:15.420
extrovert. He loved people. naturally loved 
people in his job. He loved helping people and he

05:20.378 --> 05:34.916
was a great great civic worker and that he worked 
with the in those days the they called it the

05:20.378 --> 05:34.916
community chess drives. He was a big

05:44.011 --> 06:02.697
worker and when they built the new YMCA here in 
Dallas, he took up, I remember, over a half million

05:44.011 --> 06:02.697
dollars himself, by himself, back in 1931 or 
something like this, 30 or 31, which was some

05:44.011 --> 06:02.697
doings. During the Depression, that's right. 
Purely by his consistency and tenacity and not

06:07.023 --> 06:13.191
giving up and letting somebody say, well, come 
back next week. He stayed with them and he was

06:15.029 --> 06:30.245
recognized at a dinner they had after they got 
whatever amount of money, $750,000 or something

06:15.029 --> 06:30.245
like that for their efforts. Dad was recognized 
for it. Sounds like a hard worker. Well, he was a

06:37.092 --> 06:38.454
very hard worker. He worked six days a week. And he 
played with his kids the seventh day a week. And he

06:45.813 --> 06:51.660
was a diligent church man. He worked in the church 
and was of the First Presbyterian Church down in

06:51.780 --> 06:57.627
Dallas. And he

06:58.508 --> 07:04.195
was president of his class.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.080
His high school clients? No, no. Down at the 
church. Oh, OK, OK. Down at the church. He loved to

07:13.550 --> 07:17.894
work with the kids in the neighborhood. And in the 
event that was unusual, he'd gather up a whole

07:17.974 --> 07:31.366
carload of kids and take us to show it to us where 
there was a spectacular accident or the circus

07:17.974 --> 07:31.366
came to town. They used to unload out here at Fair 
Park. And we'd go out and watch the elephants help

07:34.228 --> 07:41.515
unload the cars and watch the parade from the 
fairgrounds down downtown where they always had a

07:41.832 --> 07:46.699
circus down there by Pearl Street Market. And he'd 
always get a cartload of kids and take us down

07:47.760 --> 07:51.306
there. And he was a big worker in the

07:52.427 --> 08:01.140
baseball league. They didn't call them little 
leagues in those days. They were area leagues. We

08:05.786 --> 08:08.690
had one in East Dallas and they had one in Oak Cliff. 
They had a team in South Dallas. And he was a sponsor

08:11.279 --> 08:14.223
there. He sponsored a lot of work with the dads 
clubs at North Dallas High School. And that's

08:22.655 --> 08:32.950
where I first became interested in army training 
was at North Dallas.

08:33.651 --> 08:34.492
He encouraged me. And I joined the junior OTCs 
there and stayed with it right until. I retired in

08:40.861 --> 08:42.904
1962. Let's, before we start talking about that, 
let's talk about your mother. Can you tell me about

08:47.349 --> 08:48.350
her? Mama was the 11th and last child of her family. 
H.W. Graber and family. Grandfather Graber came

09:02.268 --> 09:09.957
over from Hamburg, Germany as a young engineer. 
and got off a boat down at Galveston and got a job

09:11.152 --> 09:18.622
with the old Texas Midland Railroad Company. And 
he railroaded up to Milliken, where the Civil War

09:19.724 --> 09:40.872
caught him, and he joined the Texas Rangers

09:19.724 --> 09:40.872
Regiment, which was a cavalry range of foraging 
outfit. And he fought four years in the Civil War.

09:49.083 --> 10:10.993
And during this time, he established himself as a 
real leader of men, meaning that he led raiding

09:49.083 --> 10:10.993
parties, gathering food and horses and animals, 
cows and sheep for food for the armies. That's what

10:16.884 --> 10:17.565
they were. They lived on the land and he was the 
leader of one of these foraging parties and as such

10:17.625 --> 10:25.260
he was captured twice. And once he escaped from 
Union prison and then they let him out on parole on

10:26.442 --> 10:34.197
the other time. Got tired of feeding him, I guess. 
But after the war, he came back. And in that time,

10:39.598 --> 10:49.229
he'd met a girl sometime during his, he met a girl 
down in Courtney, Texas, who had befriended him

10:39.598 --> 10:49.229
and helped him escape capture. And after the war, 
he ended up at war over in Virginia. He came back to

10:56.417 --> 11:02.605
Courtney, Texas, which is down below Navasota on 
Lombardos. Courtney was a big...

11:07.184 --> 11:09.486
cotton shipping town then, Port. They called it 
Cotton Shipping Port. They had a pretty good size

11:11.728 --> 11:22.678
warfare and they would haul cotton down to 
Courtney and put it on barges and haul it on down to

11:11.728 --> 11:22.678
Galveston. Anyway, he married this girl who was 
down there visiting some of her folks and she lived

11:22.698 --> 11:31.526
in Massachusetts. She was a Parks. And she, they 
married and He railroaded from Milliken, or

11:36.732 --> 11:50.544
whenever it was after the end of the war, Civil War, 
up to Waxahachie, where he decided by that time he

11:36.732 --> 11:50.544
had three or four children. And he decided that 
railroading wasn't for a family man. And he quit

11:53.327 --> 12:01.975
his railroading and set up a general store. We'd 
call it a general mercantile store today. He sold

12:05.183 --> 12:13.653
everything from coffee and beans and sugar to 
harnesses and buggies and whips and plows and this

12:05.183 --> 12:13.653
kind of thing. And where did he set that up? In 
Waukesha Hatchie. Oh, I see. That's where he quit

12:19.841 --> 12:21.263
railroading. And the railroad went on into Fort 
Worth, but he quit in Waukesha Hatchie and set up

12:21.983 --> 12:29.733
his general mercantile store there. Well, as 
such, he He would trade a plow for a cow or trade a

12:36.487 --> 12:46.716
bedroom suit for so many chickens or a calf or 
something.

12:49.658 --> 12:56.504
He made a good living for his wife and living kids.

13:00.768 --> 13:05.852
He remembered his young college student in 
Hamburg, Germany. of the Heine Boiler Company

13:07.064 --> 13:09.506
there. And something motivated him to contact 
them when he had this general mercantile store

13:10.767 --> 13:24.560
there in Waukesha Hatchie to get the Heine Boiler 
franchise for Texas. And he did that. And that

13:27.682 --> 13:36.430
motivated him after he found that he could make 
more money out of selling and installing boilers

13:27.682 --> 13:36.430
than he could out of his mercantile store, he moved 
to Dallas. And

13:38.249 --> 13:46.561
he sold lots of boilers around, Heine boilers. 
They were a very efficient coal-fired boiler in

13:46.581 --> 13:50.466
those days. I know of two of them that still have his 
name, or did have his name plates on them a year or so

13:52.649 --> 13:58.197
ago. One that he put in at White Rock Water Pump 
Station. and one down at the old Brown Cracker and

14:05.705 --> 14:12.512
Candy Company down on Lamar Street. He installed 
and sold them and installed them, and I'm sure

14:12.532 --> 14:23.402
there were many, many more around town and in 
Texas. He made a good living out of it and made some

14:24.163 --> 14:25.985
money. And

14:26.025 --> 14:34.733
after the war, I mean after he got too old to work, He 
retired, of course, and wrote his memoirs of the

14:35.658 --> 14:41.766
Civil War. Really? I've got a copy here. No 
kidding. It was a great thing for the old

14:48.154 --> 14:49.756
gentleman. He spent a lot of time doing that. I bet 
you really enjoyed this. Oh, yeah.

15:02.432 --> 15:05.175
And he reached the rank of general. No, no, no, no. 
That is after the war in the United Confederate

15:06.671 --> 15:13.238
Veterans Organization. Oh, I see. Like reserves 
are today. He was commissary general, which means

15:17.122 --> 15:23.228
quartermaster general today. Oh,

15:23.248 --> 15:28.093
this is fantastic. 1916, this is published.

15:35.024 --> 15:51.427
Well, I've sat on his knee by the hour and by the day, 
and he tells me all the tales are here and there, and

15:35.024 --> 15:51.427
this is a real trophy, a real... Sure is.

15:51.447 --> 15:51.908
Heirloom. What impact do you think he had on your 
mother? Well, certainly he was a stern

15:55.834 --> 16:01.842
disciplinarian, In his own right, that was the way 
he was brought up. And he was with my mother and all

16:04.657 --> 16:14.406
the kids and with me, with my brother and me when we 
came along. He was a distinguished gentleman,

16:15.167 --> 16:26.837
very patient, very kind old gentleman.

16:29.039 --> 16:31.221
I'm sure he was a tremendous influence on my 
family. Was your father the authority in the

16:31.792 --> 16:36.417
household then? You bet. You bet he was. My daddy 
was very patient with my brother and me. My

16:43.324 --> 16:46.448
brother's 20 months older than I am. And of course, 
growing up like kids will do, we had our

16:47.589 --> 16:52.054
differences. Oh, sure. And we're always at one 
another's trying to excel in one another. Every

17:02.656 --> 17:07.583
now and then, we'd get beyond our better 
judgments, and we'd go to Fish City. And Mama would

17:07.603 --> 17:11.528
tell him about it as soon as we got home. And boy, I'd 
go to the woodshed. That's all there was to it. Went

17:15.654 --> 17:20.401
to the woodshed, and he impressed on us. I wasn't 
worried for his boys to act. The last lick he and I

17:24.607 --> 17:30.435
got was for, I'll never forget,

17:31.259 --> 17:36.708
I was always taught to say yes ma'am and no ma'am, 
yes sir and no sir to anybody who's older than I am.

17:37.189 --> 17:37.870
And I do it today. But one time my mother said 
something to me, I don't know, I was sure I, I doubt

17:37.930 --> 17:50.711
if I, I was probably in grammar school, but not 
much, never very far in grammar school. And mama

17:52.634 --> 17:57.823
asked me a question and I said no or yes, one, I 
forget which. And she told Eddie when he came home

17:59.862 --> 18:05.029
from work, hey, boy, go to the woodshed. I went to 
the woodshed, and he came out and talked to me for 10

18:05.049 --> 18:16.343
minutes, telling me that wasn't the way for young 
boys to grow up, and it wasn't the way he wanted his

18:05.049 --> 18:16.343
children to react. And then he got his belt off, and 
he was impressing me with that.

18:25.475 --> 18:27.898
And he broke his belt on me. Really? It was probably 
an old belt. A leather belt? Huh? A leather belt?

18:32.402 --> 18:32.622
Oh, yeah. It was an old leather belt, probably 
rotten. And I may have had a grin on my face when he

18:36.287 --> 18:42.054
broke that belt because he said, boy, you stay 
there. And he went back in the house. He saved with

18:46.540 --> 18:48.703
one of these old fashioned razors. It had a long 
razor strap like he used to be home. And he brought

18:52.167 --> 18:53.870
that razor strap out there. And he got my attention 
with that razor strap. That's what he did. And

18:57.980 --> 19:08.960
today I say yes sir, no sir, no ma'am, and yes ma'am 
to any lady and to anybody that's older than I am.

19:08.980 --> 19:12.767
That's one of the indelible things that I learned. 
It didn't hurt me a bit in the world. It taught me a

19:16.674 --> 19:18.216
lesson. I live by the day. Treat your brother the 
same way? You bet. How many brothers did you have?

19:24.978 --> 19:25.518
Just two? Just the two of us. Two kids in the family? 
Just the two of us, yeah. Oh, yeah. He was a very

19:32.845 --> 19:39.050
stern person, meaning he'd tell you to do 
something, and he'd tell you why he wanted it done

19:32.845 --> 19:39.050
that way. Like eating at the table. He'd say, I 
don't care how much you take. You take three pieces

19:44.095 --> 19:46.997
of chicken or four pieces of chicken. Take all the 
chicken. But you can eat what's on your plate.

19:50.782 --> 19:52.324
because we can't afford to waste it. And

19:53.626 --> 20:01.576
he didn't have to say, boy, what's on the plate, put 
twice to me. First time, he said it, and I didn't eat

20:01.596 --> 20:04.740
it. And the second time, he said it, and he wham, and 
I ended in the corner. And today, I don't take

20:09.506 --> 20:12.790
anything and put it on the plate. I don't eat. I 
clean my plate up. But he was a great person. I mean,

20:17.276 --> 20:18.738
he indulged kids. He indulged me in the wind. and 
sending me to the Hawaii schools and Hawaii camps.

20:29.493 --> 20:40.651
He indulged us by buying me a new baseball mitt when 
my mitt was old and rotted out where I left it out in

20:29.493 --> 20:40.651
the rain and it got rotted. He would go play with us 
on Saturday afternoon or Sunday, play ball with

20:41.452 --> 20:48.463
all the kids in the neighborhood. And so for all of 
his strict discipline, he was a great

20:49.439 --> 20:58.529
leader for kids, is what I'm trying to say. And all 
the kids in the neighborhood respect him, and

20:59.810 --> 21:02.193
certainly I do. I did then, and I knew now. I don't 
remember crossing him twice, and that was the time

21:04.716 --> 21:13.766
when I said, yeah, not to my mother, and when I 
didn't eat what was on my plate. And he told me the

21:13.886 --> 21:16.729
first time, the second time, why he didn't. He told 
me another way, and I respect it. Now, it sounds

21:21.819 --> 21:26.345
like he had a definite impact on your career. No 
question about it. In what way do you think he

21:27.847 --> 21:30.991
helped you to succeed? Well, he taught me to think 
straight and sit down and reason and convince

21:31.011 --> 21:47.273
myself that what I was doing is right, and then to

21:31.011 --> 21:47.273
follow through on it if it's right. at that 
particular time is right today you know

21:47.472 --> 22:13.260
situations change and that changes your your 
decision but if you sit down and reason the thing

21:47.472 --> 22:13.260
out with the best information you have at the time 
that's right right thing to do at that time why

21:47.472 --> 22:13.260
that's the right thing to do period

21:47.472 --> 22:13.260
and that's the way i've always lived that's where 
worked in my Army career, and that's where I ran my

22:13.831 --> 22:18.295
business, and that's where I live today.

22:21.078 --> 22:22.920
Okay, let's talk about your education. We haven't 
touched on that. Could you tell me about that?

22:26.984 --> 22:38.255
Well, I started in, we lived on the corner of Ross 
and Fitcher, where I was born, and right across the

22:26.984 --> 22:38.255
street from it, Caddy Wompert Cross Street, is 
Fannin Grade School, which is still there. And

22:39.256 --> 22:43.180
that's where I went to grammar school, grade 
school, we called it in those days. I remember one

22:44.071 --> 22:49.257
event that happened. It was a two-story building. 
They had a square block, and the grade school sat

22:52.241 --> 22:58.789
back in the far end of the block there, away from our 
house. And I remember

23:00.792 --> 23:12.306
it caught on fire one night, in retrospect, and 
hearing all the discussion and everything, and

23:00.792 --> 23:12.306
the arsonist set it on fire. an arsonist who wanted 
to get even with his girlfriend, who was a teacher

23:14.429 --> 23:19.316
there. Of course, I remember this back and hearing 
my parents talk about it. But anyway, when the fire

23:25.947 --> 23:34.920
engines came and they started putting the fire out 
and all, my mother and my father looked for me in the

23:25.947 --> 23:34.920
bed, and I wasn't there. So they knew exactly where 
I was. And when they got in there looking for me,

23:37.645 --> 23:43.153
they tell me the story that there I was tugging on 
the fireman's coat. Please, Mr. Fireman, let it

23:43.960 --> 23:51.510
burn a little more so I won't have to go to school 
tomorrow.

23:51.530 --> 23:54.574
But I went there. In other words, would it be fair to 
say that you did not like grade school? No, this

24:00.943 --> 24:04.608
typical kid reaction would burn the school down. 
No, I loved school. I loved to be with the kids, and I

24:08.513 --> 24:13.039
tried to... excelled in school. My daddy and my 
uncle encouraged my brother and me both to excel.

24:24.348 --> 24:30.938
And they had an incentive

24:24.348 --> 24:30.938
program between them. Wanted to do it one year and 
wanted to do it the next year. Offering

24:35.225 --> 24:39.111
us and I think it started out in nickel and E. In 
those days, they grade you

24:41.690 --> 25:05.420
excellent, E for excellent,

24:41.690 --> 25:05.420
an S for satisfactory, a P for passion, and a U for 
unsatisfactory. And my father would give my

25:05.901 --> 25:11.528
brother or me a nickel for each E we'd bring home. 
And he wouldn't give us anything but a frown and

25:18.977 --> 25:34.818
say, boy, do better when we brought home an S or a P.

25:18.977 --> 25:34.818
I remember specifically he says, don't bring any 
U's home.

25:38.042 --> 25:39.945
And I knew that about- You'd never bring any home? I 
knew enough by that time not to bring any home. No, I

25:42.725 --> 25:45.348
didn't. Not until I got to A&M.

25:52.015 --> 25:57.902
I started grammar school in 1917 and graduated in 
1924, of course, seven years of grammar school. I

25:59.684 --> 26:08.734
went over to North Dallas in 1924 and graduated in 
1928.

26:09.153 --> 26:11.176
What were your favorite subjects? I just took a 
straight

26:11.196 --> 26:29.860
course in high school with the idea of going to A&M 
and studying engineering, meaning I took four

26:11.196 --> 26:29.860
years of mathematics, four years of English, four 
years of Latin. I don't know why I took Latin except

26:30.862 --> 26:38.552
I had a little girlfriend who was studying Latin, 
so That may have had some influence on me. I've

26:42.059 --> 26:46.503
often said I should have taken four years of 
Spanish, but I didn't. And then took the real usual

26:47.664 --> 27:07.003
subjects of chemistry and physics and

26:47.664 --> 27:07.003
some extra mathematics, extra algebra, and an 
indoctrination course in calculus and that kind

26:47.664 --> 27:07.003
of thing. You said that you had the idea that you 
were going to go to A&M to study engineering. When

27:11.875 --> 27:13.176
did you get this idea? When you were 13, 14, 15 years 
old? I presume it was about that formerly age.

27:22.024 --> 27:23.405
How'd you come about this idea? Well, I had a cousin 
that I admired, and he went to A&M. Oh, I see. And he

27:29.230 --> 27:37.497
would come home at Christmas time or during the 
summer, and

27:29.230 --> 27:37.497
he impressed me. that was place to go to be an 
engineer and I had wanted to be an engineer. I've

27:44.817 --> 28:03.467
always loved to build things and my cousin going 
down there and he'd come home in his uniform and

27:44.817 --> 28:03.467
that impressed me and when I got in high school I 
decided to take ROTC and that's where I wanted to go

28:06.282 --> 28:09.706
to A&M. And I set my heart on it and that's where my 
family and I were able to swing the deal.

28:23.001 --> 28:28.507
Would you consider yourself a leader in high 
school in any way? Did you organize any groups? or

28:30.886 --> 28:34.670
activities or sports or anything? Well, yes, I 
played at sports. I never did

28:37.592 --> 28:44.018
really excel in sports. Perhaps I didn't apply 
myself to it because I had the size and all, but it

28:44.038 --> 28:54.488
was more fun instead of trying to excel in it. It's 
highly motivated today, and to me it was just a

29:00.282 --> 29:05.286
relaxation and another something for me to do in my 
spare time.

29:07.929 --> 29:21.601
I was interested in

29:07.929 --> 29:21.601
having an academic status rather than a physical 
sports status. I set my heart on being an engineer

29:22.081 --> 29:29.648
and my father and even my cousin who graduated down 
there or who had been down there impressed

29:29.915 --> 29:37.906
on me that you had to apply yourself and study. And

29:39.688 --> 29:46.918
that sold me on going to A&M. And that's what 
directed me just taking the standard four-year

29:47.679 --> 29:55.450
course in high school of four years math, four 
years English. four years Latin, and actually I

29:55.868 --> 29:59.872
learned more English in Latin class than I did in 
English class. I think that's fine basic

30:02.295 --> 30:10.043
instruction for any youngster coming along, if he 
can work it in his curriculum, and I did. So when you

30:12.246 --> 30:19.834
graduated from high school then, you had a firm set 
of goals or aims that you already wanted to

30:12.246 --> 30:19.834
accomplish. Yes, I had made up my mind I wanted to be 
an engineer. Now why was that? During the summers I

30:26.024 --> 30:31.672
worked in, my cousin first. And during the summers 
I had worked on construction jobs as a water boy

30:32.213 --> 30:47.695
first, and then as a timekeeper, and then as a kind 
of a office boy. running errands for the

30:48.569 --> 30:56.116
superintendent, or going and getting some 
equipment, or going and getting some material, or

30:48.569 --> 30:56.116
this kind of thing. And

30:56.196 --> 31:02.401
I wanted to be an engineer. I wanted the 
engineering training, ultimately, to get into

31:03.142 --> 31:10.429
the construction business for myself. And so I 
planted that seed back in those days and finally

31:10.449 --> 31:17.715
germinated in 1952.

31:20.108 --> 31:23.273
when I set up this company. Actually I had a partner 
but that lasted for a while and then I bought him out

31:23.333 --> 31:31.445
and I ran it from 1964. That's when I bought him out 
and I've run it ever since until July 1st last year

31:31.605 --> 31:40.317
when I sold it. Tell me about your first 
impressions of A&M.

31:48.458 --> 31:52.784
Well, it's any good, bad, and any different.

31:53.225 --> 32:02.178
My

31:53.225 --> 32:02.178
first impression of A&M is that my father and my 
mother put me on a train. The old Lyle had used to

32:02.558 --> 32:09.488
leave Dallas at 11.30 at night and got down to 
College Station about 4.30 in the morning. And

32:11.131 --> 32:16.879
they packed me up with a suitcase, And

32:17.922 --> 32:23.249
I guess a footlocker, something like that. Put me 
on the train and wished me well. And I got off this

32:29.819 --> 32:44.319
train down at the old station, which sat across, is 
that Highway 5 or Highway 6 runs up and down there?

32:44.339 --> 32:45.140
6. 6. And that was between the railroad station and 
the campus, the old main academic building, which

32:47.082 --> 32:54.488
was the campus. They had that esplanade with the 
lights going up there. And got off and got off the

33:00.293 --> 33:07.580
train and of course nobody knew anything about 
where to go, what you do. And it was some

33:09.061 --> 33:16.347
enterprise, some sophomore down there, selling 
brooms and this kind of thing too. you need a broom

33:16.867 --> 33:21.352
sweep your room out and all that kind of thing. And

33:21.372 --> 33:46.097
it seemed like I walked a hundred miles getting up 
to the academic building where A&M had some person

33:21.372 --> 33:46.097
in authority and said you make yourselves at home 
and this is where you want to be at eight o'clock and

33:21.372 --> 33:46.097
we'll matriculate and go from there. and uh he said 
you can carry did you carry that big case oh no i

33:47.950 --> 34:16.607
carried my suitcase but i didn't carry the 
footlocker i just just left that down there it was

33:47.950 --> 34:16.607
it was baggage so to speak and they unloaded all 
that on the loading docks and i went down there

33:47.950 --> 34:16.607
after i found out i was going to live in goodman hall

33:47.950 --> 34:16.607
this gentleman admitted us also said you can walk 
right down this way that big, long building down

34:17.127 --> 34:21.572
there, which is a piece of hall, and you can get 
something to eat if you're hungry. So when the sun

34:22.553 --> 34:27.959
came up, a bunch of us said, let's go get something 
to eat. And we went and got something to eat,

34:27.999 --> 34:38.530
waiting until 8 o'clock came when the advisors got 
out and

34:27.999 --> 34:38.530
told us how to go about matriculating. And we took 
our choice of what branch of the service we wanted

34:38.650 --> 34:43.135
to be in. And there were three of us from North 
Dallas High School that went down. I'd always

34:49.615 --> 34:55.601
loved to ride horses in my younger days. And so

34:55.861 --> 35:09.053
as an engineering student, we had the choice of 
being in the engineers or the field artillery. And

35:09.074 --> 35:10.415
I chose field artillery. And these other two boys 
wanted to go into the cavalry, but I persuaded

35:10.435 --> 35:13.898
them. we all three went in the field artillery. And 
that's where I started in the field artillery and

35:17.411 --> 35:28.124
training and of course it stayed right with me 
until I retired. I was one of the very fortunate

35:30.007 --> 35:42.923
field artillerymen to be able to have trained all 
the way through from an old French 75 through the

35:43.865 --> 35:53.577
horse-drawn artillery and through the motorized 
artillery and through the rocket artillery up to

35:43.865 --> 35:53.577
the Zeus and Nike, which is where I left them. And 
that was a

35:55.219 --> 36:10.598
very fortunate day, a complete cycle of military 
armament from a pea shooter up to the rockets as we

35:55.219 --> 36:10.598
know them today. Yeah, a revolution. A real 
revolution. Just like we've had the machine

36:16.649 --> 36:25.301
revolution and the social revolution, there was a 
real revolution in hardware in the Army. Now let's

36:26.143 --> 36:40.483
talk about A&M for a minute here, and what I'd like 
to know is did the military, the aspect that A&M was

36:26.143 --> 36:40.483
a military institution, did that have anything to 
do with your decision, or when did you first become

36:26.143 --> 36:40.483
interested in the military? When I went to high 
school, I joined the ROTC there. And I continually

36:45.414 --> 37:10.605
worked at it, meaning I participated in all the 
events,

36:45.414 --> 37:10.605
meaning they had the crack company, which was a 
represented North Dallas High School in

37:10.872 --> 37:21.243
competition against the other four high schools 
at that time, the other three high schools at that

37:10.872 --> 37:21.243
time. They only had four high schools in Dallas in 
those days. And we had rifle competition. Margin

37:29.371 --> 37:30.652
and drill competition? Drill competition, 
purely and simply drill competition as a company

37:30.672 --> 37:36.378
unit. Right. We won it one year and we got beat three 
years and

37:38.969 --> 37:46.340
win some, lose some, you know. What did you like 
about down? Well, I love the artillery. I love the

37:51.768 --> 37:54.732
competition in it. I said artillery, I mean the 
drill. I love the drill and the competition in it.

38:04.126 --> 38:06.850
And because I worked at it, I got promoted to 
corporal, and then sergeant, and then six

38:07.454 --> 38:29.734
striper, sergeant major, and then I don't know, I 
guess my junior year I got promoted to lieutenant,

38:07.454 --> 38:29.734
and my senior year I was promoted to captain, and 
the company commander, which was up the line, you

38:07.454 --> 38:29.734
know. I

38:29.754 --> 38:37.461
participated in the rifles competition, the 
pistol competition, And we participated in horse

38:38.538 --> 38:43.463
competitions. We were using the old 112th 
Cavalry, which National Guard troop horses. Our

38:51.731 --> 38:59.880
commandant over in North Dallas had a friend that 
commanded one of the troops in the 112th Cavalry.

38:59.900 --> 39:07.127
And he would let us come out and exercise the horses 
on Saturday, meaning that we could ride them and

38:59.900 --> 39:07.127
run them. And that was a real fun and a real 
challenge. And that

39:13.771 --> 39:24.746
confirmed my love for horses and it eventually 
showed up in the artillery.

39:27.350 --> 39:27.470
Yeah. So in other words, you had a position of 
leadership as early as high school in the

39:27.490 --> 39:32.037
military. Yes, I was a company commander and

39:38.461 --> 39:41.464
I commanded the crack company, but we didn't win 
the competition. But I'm sure I'll lose some of

39:42.545 --> 39:49.391
this, I don't know what to say about that. Sure, oh 
yeah. Tell me about your, when you got to A&M and you

39:51.894 --> 39:56.959
were on the Aggie Corps, could you tell me about 
your outfit? Well, I was in B battery field

39:57.399 --> 40:01.443
artillery the whole time. I started over there in 
Goodwin Hall.

40:11.468 --> 40:17.435
We lived two years in Goodwin, one year in Milner, 
and one year in Mitchell Halls. I don't know

40:18.496 --> 40:20.278
whether Goodwin's still there or not. I think it 
is, yeah. Milner and Mitchell are still there. I

40:23.341 --> 40:25.564
think they've renovated those, but I don't know 
about Goodwin. There was Goodwin, and right

40:27.046 --> 40:39.079
behind it is

40:27.046 --> 40:39.079
the Zell Hall, and then the chapel was on down at the 
end of the military old drag there, the old chapel

40:39.262 --> 40:45.450
where we went to church.

40:52.499 --> 40:59.688
I rocked along and

40:52.499 --> 40:59.688
made average grades. I didn't excel because I was 
having fishitis, I guess you'd call it. They don't

41:07.257 --> 41:15.148
participate in that type of hazing anymore, but 
they sure did in my era. Well, can you tell me about

41:15.328 --> 41:19.353
some of the experiences, those hazing 
experiences? Well, at this upperclassmen-run

41:19.674 --> 41:35.155
company, company commander is a senior, of 
course, and he ran it, and he delegated his

41:19.674 --> 41:35.155
authority to the first sergeant, and the first 
sergeant ran the housekeeping of it, and

41:19.674 --> 41:35.155
sophomores did all the the hazing, so to speak, and 
being sophomores and making the freshmen

41:35.911 --> 41:47.647
adhere to their likings and dislikings. It's all 
good fun. It was a typical A&M tradition. And I

41:54.137 --> 42:00.866
don't regret one moment of it. I say that the change 
has been all for the better. Perhaps it was

42:06.303 --> 42:13.493
excessive in my day, but I don't begrudge it. Every 
sophomore and junior and one or two seniors that

42:14.955 --> 42:24.969
whipped my ass, I respected tremendously because 
they were my seniors. And sometimes I didn't clean

42:26.310 --> 42:31.197
their room like they thought I ought to. I was 
reprimanded for it, but that was part of the fun of

42:32.003 --> 42:37.488
being a freshman, a fish. I

42:39.050 --> 42:54.725
don't think it

42:39.050 --> 42:54.725
hurt me a bit, and it certainly, I think, made a 
better man of being able to take punishment and

42:39.050 --> 42:54.725
liking it. And every time that

43:00.978 --> 43:01.959
One of them whipped my ass. I got up and thanked him 
for it, for straightening me out. And that was the

43:05.964 --> 43:09.609
tradition of A&M at that time. And

43:11.031 --> 43:17.479
these gentlemen who you're talking to will tell 
you the same story. Yeah, I know. It's just

43:19.081 --> 43:20.282
interesting. It was a tradition in those days. And 
if you stayed past the first Thanksgiving, why,

43:23.626 --> 43:29.854
you could live with anything. People that

43:30.796 --> 43:46.272
were completely obsessed with going to A&M and 
participating in

43:30.796 --> 43:46.272
the core traditions didn't come back after 
Thanksgiving. Or certainly they didn't come back

43:46.672 --> 43:50.096
after Christmas, the first year. And if you stayed 
that first four months, five months, the only

43:51.737 --> 44:00.246
reason you left A&M was because of academic 
deficiency. Did a lot of people drop out?

44:10.415 --> 44:12.138
Because of what now? Because of the hazing? Did a 
lot of your colleagues say, well, I just don't want

44:13.399 --> 44:18.026
to take this? Do you remember? Well, I'm sure some 
of them did. I'm sure some of them did.

44:26.659 --> 44:30.705
My two roommates dropped out at One of them dropped 
out at the end of our fish year because of academic

44:31.613 --> 44:35.319
deficiency. They wouldn't let him return. And the 
other one dropped out at the end of my sophomore

44:38.183 --> 44:44.412
year because of financial considerations.

44:47.056 --> 44:53.466
I doubt if 10% of them dropped out because of this 
so-called hazing. I doubt it because Then a boy

44:59.339 --> 45:08.069
didn't go down there unless he was obsessed with 
wanting to go to A&M and wanting to be in the Corps.

45:08.089 --> 45:09.611
You had to be in the Corps to go there. Or you were 
classified as a casual, meaning you had a physical

45:10.932 --> 45:21.224
disability and you had to wear a uniform at that. 
But if you had a physical disability, well, you

45:23.567 --> 45:28.232
could go be a casual, but you wore the uniform. So 
everybody was in uniform, everybody was the same.

45:35.151 --> 45:38.195
Rich men, poor men, sons are all the same. And the 
only thing that separates you was your academic

45:39.377 --> 45:50.312
leadership or qualifications and your ROTC. Did 
you like the fact that you were all the same? Did I

45:53.857 --> 45:54.798
like the fact? You bet. You bet because Those were 
hard times. Sure were. Those were hard times. And

46:02.976 --> 46:07.680
I'm sure there were some rich men's sons there. But 
my father wasn't a rich man. And he had two of us in

46:10.803 --> 46:13.005
college at the same time. And my brother went to 
University of Texas. And I was A&M. And so I worked

46:21.652 --> 46:25.195
while I was down there. Can you tell me what you did? 
I worked. doing everything, anything I could get a

46:28.878 --> 46:31.923
job at doing. I worked in Spesa Hall. I worked 
building help as labor on Saturdays, helped

46:34.949 --> 46:50.436
building the then chemistry building, the new 
chemistry building, and I'm sure it's been

46:34.949 --> 46:50.436
enlarged many times since then. Dr. Hedges was the

46:56.148 --> 46:57.890
head of the chemistry department at that time. I 
worked over there as a laborer. I worked down in the

47:01.274 --> 47:18.175
agronomy lab grinding up samples of dirt and 
running tests for old Dr. Asbury, who was one of the

47:01.274 --> 47:18.175
old great saints of A&M at that time. Do you 
remember what you made? As I remember,

47:26.472 --> 47:27.960
15 cents an hour.
