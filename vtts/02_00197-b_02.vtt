WEBVTT

00:03.338 --> 00:05.581
Mostly gardening at that time. Vegetable 
gardening? I tried that with little success. Did

00:10.809 --> 00:12.771
it shift into flowers? No, I never did much with 
flowers. Where did you go to celebrate?

00:20.282 --> 00:20.783
Celebrate? I don't remember any celebration.

00:27.432 --> 00:29.295
You know a guy whom I haven't mentioned? 
celebration makes me think of it because for some

00:30.592 --> 01:00.497
obscure reason I thought then Mennonite

00:30.592 --> 01:00.497
who the devil was the guy the general who moved into 
the office at my invitation oh such a wonderful

00:30.592 --> 01:00.497
loyal person I'm embarrassed that I his name no no 
the guy who became head of the health service here

00:30.592 --> 01:00.497
then after he left the dean's office Oh my, that's 
really embarrassing. You know the man, he's been

01:06.443 --> 01:31.108
active in Kiwanis or Lyons or whatever, all kinds 
of activities around town, very generous, but

01:06.443 --> 01:31.108
from a Mennonite background, I may have the sect a 
little wrong, terrible tragedies in his life, two

01:06.443 --> 01:31.108
of his children committed suicide, his wife was a 
depressive But he was always of good cheer. He'd

01:34.056 --> 01:40.622
been chief in San Antonio of a hospital down there. 
What the devil? Pathologist. Gosh, I've got to

01:44.266 --> 01:53.194
remember his name because somewhere he needs to 
get some accolades or recognition or something.

01:55.236 --> 01:57.859
Loyal, warm, kind person. Hard worker. All right. 
If you were giving advice to today's

02:00.569 --> 02:12.427
administrators

02:00.569 --> 02:12.427
about the medical school, what advice would you 
give them? Well, I'm out of touch, so it wouldn't be

02:14.631 --> 02:17.495
specific. It would be more kind of process. And I 
think that, now it depends on the level.

02:29.763 --> 02:43.937
At the level of university administration, I 
don't know what you all do when you get together and

02:29.763 --> 02:43.937
talk or when they have those meetings for the new 
presidents.

02:43.957 --> 02:47.721
And I don't know the extent to which medicine is 
special. For me, it's very special. But I don't

02:50.383 --> 02:58.251
know the extent that it's more special problem or 
opportunity for a president than engineering or

02:50.383 --> 02:58.251
whatever. I think the university presidents need 
to have much broader understanding, I'm going to

03:00.205 --> 03:14.005
stick with medicine, of medical education in 
other institutions. That to me was the most

03:14.806 --> 03:25.361
stultifying thing here, that the people with whom 
I was dealing knew nothing about medical

03:14.806 --> 03:25.361
education and didn't want to learn. Now, at the 
level of the medical school deans, I really think

03:30.766 --> 03:50.704
there is, although they talk about experiments in 
medical education, there is a very active group

03:30.766 --> 03:50.704
called RIME, Research in Medical Education, yet 
medical education is frozen into a frame of

03:30.766 --> 03:50.704
reference. And there are very few real 
experiments in medical education. One of them,

03:58.090 --> 04:00.132
incidentally, is in New Mexico. which I didn't 
initiate, but I fostered and it came out of the

04:00.533 --> 04:05.638
faculty. It's still going on and it's truly 
distinguished. But I did nothing except get out of

04:08.822 --> 04:10.944
the way of that. If you were organizing 
administratively this institution and its

04:11.985 --> 04:21.174
medical school, where would you place the medical 
school administratively? Yeah, that's a

04:21.575 --> 04:23.577
perennial problem. And I think the answer, I guess 
it sounds like a pretty soft answer. The answer is

04:29.879 --> 04:31.962
not in the structure. It is in the relationships 
among the people. It is not in the structure. Would

04:37.732 --> 04:41.919
you have that report, would it be part of the 
university or part of the system? I won't do that. I

04:43.842 --> 04:49.551
won't do that because I don't believe it's 
structural, Haskell. I believe that while you

04:51.530 --> 04:59.978
might need to have a table of organization, every 
table of organization can and will work. I'm

04:59.998 --> 05:01.840
absolutely adamant about that. I feel very 
strongly about it because the debates have been

05:02.381 --> 05:06.024
endless. And one of the problems that my several 
successors have had is they have come in with

05:06.425 --> 05:20.018
traditional views about what their prerogatives 
were, what the structure should be, and they have

05:06.425 --> 05:20.018
come a cropper. Not just in this university, they 
went into another university. I don't know what

05:24.737 --> 05:27.422
you had at Missouri. I visited Missouri when Joe 
White was still vice president, and they wanted me

05:27.562 --> 05:36.877
to... Joe White... I feel that I was vigorously, 
enthusiastically recruited at Missouri when Joe

05:36.897 --> 05:43.407
White was there. I never told Joe, but what turned 
me off and made me absolutely refuse to take that

05:44.213 --> 05:56.369
job was Joe White, when he told me that he wanted me 
to come, he said, the first thing you're going to

05:44.213 --> 05:56.369
have to do is fire the chairman of anesthesiology. 
Well, that's horse manure. Would you, again, in

06:01.015 --> 06:11.530
this, you're the advisor, you would perhaps 
reduce the enrollment a little, class size? Oh,

06:11.890 --> 06:14.153
yes, yes, yes. That would have to be done carefully 
for financial political reasons. And that's what

06:19.577 --> 06:26.066
makes faculties anywhere nervous, particularly 
state-funded institutions. They figure, well,

06:26.106 --> 06:29.071
somebody is going to look at that cost per student. 
The cost per student is going to go up, and they'll

06:29.491 --> 06:33.998
cut our appropriation. Would you modify the 
instructional program and add more or less? No,

06:39.645 --> 06:52.964
again, I think that there's been much too much made 
of that, of engineering the curriculum and giving

06:39.645 --> 06:52.964
more hours to this or fewer hours to that or saying 
that this course has to follow that. I don't think

06:54.065 --> 06:57.831
those are the issues, and yet that's what 
preoccupies the faculty. And you would tell the

06:59.333 --> 07:02.938
faculty, keep emphasizing what? I don't want to be 
buddies with the students. I don't want the

07:08.516 --> 07:12.823
students to call the faculty by their first name, 
categorically.

07:15.627 --> 07:21.195
But they are faculties to teach, and they have 
multiple responsibilities. They are faculties

07:21.235 --> 07:27.044
to create, but the students can't be given short 
shrift. They cannot, whether it's Harvard or

07:28.246 --> 07:35.136
Texas A&M or wherever. The faculty has to teach. 
It's a hard job being a faculty member, tough job. I

07:41.489 --> 07:42.050
wouldn't want it. Should A&M try to do more in 
involving local practitioners? No, no. There's a

07:54.322 --> 07:57.806
good mix there you think? I think it would be 
tilting at windmills. I think it's wasted effort.

08:03.311 --> 08:04.853
In New Mexico I tried very hard because the medical 
practice in New Mexico when I was there was

08:05.727 --> 08:11.016
primitive. And we tried to help people and get them 
involved and provide continuing medical

08:12.078 --> 08:20.291
education opportunities. But those old guys are, 
and they were guys, not women, are, you know, they

08:21.193 --> 08:31.650
were at the bottom of the class to start with, and 
they still are. All right, now, what topics have we

08:32.997 --> 08:35.901
not touched on? That's it, sex.

08:42.071 --> 08:51.805
Let's make believe that at some future date 
someone walked up to you and gave you a check for a

08:42.071 --> 08:51.805
million dollars with one restriction. It must be 
passed on to Texas A&M. If you could make a very

08:54.489 --> 08:58.836
large contribution to A&M For what purpose would 
you want it? A million dollars wouldn't do

09:01.430 --> 09:03.032
anything. A million dollars buys one professor. 
If you could make a substantial gift, what would it

09:05.996 --> 09:12.244
be for?

09:14.988 --> 09:17.371
In your gizzard, what are you most concerned 
about?

09:20.355 --> 09:24.621
For a while, a national group that I was involved 
with was doing something that wasn't unique to

09:25.360 --> 09:36.956
medical education, but leadership development 
and serious

09:25.360 --> 09:36.956
attention. I got some of this at the Sloan School, 
in fact quite a bit. I did a fair bit of third party

09:43.085 --> 09:47.611
consulting while I was at Sloan School. You 
probably know Bennis, Warren Bennis, even

09:52.698 --> 09:59.268
consulted with him, with Paul Lawrence and I went 
out to the University of Cincinnati when he was

09:52.698 --> 09:59.268
there and having trouble. What I believe,

10:01.732 --> 10:13.710
I believe that really good

10:15.243 --> 10:19.653
behavioral science, I guess I would say, emphasis 
on behavioral science. That's the background

10:20.294 --> 10:26.809
that I got from Harvard and MIT working with Paul 
Lawrence who was at Harvard. That's what I think

10:29.114 --> 10:34.787
faculty needs more than accounting or good 
business practices or other highly structured

10:35.257 --> 10:56.925
relationships, when one looks at the good 
managers in industry, they've been guys who've

10:35.257 --> 10:56.925
walked around the plant, who went down on the floor 
and talked to the foreman and the men on the

10:35.257 --> 10:56.925
assembly line. I think what I've seen, I think they 
did that. They weren't too proud. And they needed

11:03.286 --> 11:04.327
to know. It was where they got information. It was 
where they knew what their organizations were

11:06.449 --> 11:08.992
doing. Can you imagine the president of Texas A&M 
University coming over and shooting a bull with

11:10.453 --> 11:20.424
the dean or the students? It doesn't happen. Or the 
regents? I'm proud to say that I never missed a

11:25.569 --> 11:33.057
semester teaching a freshman class, early on 
Tuesday and Thursday morning. So at least I had a

11:33.998 --> 11:38.524
little bit of real-world experience. All right, 
then,

11:39.305 --> 11:50.220
to conclude, in two or three questions, how do you 
feel about your years at A&M?

11:53.184 --> 11:53.725
Regretful. What do you mean? Well,

11:56.188 --> 12:01.035
I don't think there's much to show for it. You don't 
think that medical school represents some...

12:06.276 --> 12:07.918
It's not a distinguished medical school. It has 
some good points, and

12:09.401 --> 12:22.640
I suppose like most universities or whatever, 
whatever we have is the best or the greatest, but it

12:09.401 --> 12:22.640
ain't. On a national scale, this is not a 
distinguished medical school. And I'm sorry that

12:27.827 --> 12:30.651
that's the case. Could it have become 
distinguished in a quarter century? Well,

12:37.746 --> 12:43.793
I don't know. We don't have a controlled 
experiment. Perhaps under different leadership

12:46.076 --> 12:51.944
it could have, but that's not the issue that I'm 
dealing with. I'm dealing with the reality of what

12:52.405 --> 12:59.794
there is there, and what there is there is a medical 
school in the fourth quartile of how you might rank

13:00.280 --> 13:03.024
medical schools in the country. But hasn't it made 
more progress than any of the other brand new ones?

13:09.875 --> 13:10.516
I don't think so.

13:14.282 --> 13:19.570
What do you feel about this institution in 
general? About what institution? Texas A&M?

13:30.723 --> 13:45.623
that the regents, maybe mostly the regents, that 
the former students do not have a

13:30.723 --> 13:45.623
clear understanding

13:30.723 --> 13:45.623
that this is not a distinguished university. 
They're kidding themselves. It's not. It's a big

13:50.770 --> 13:52.032
university. It's the biggest in the world as far as 
I'm concerned. But you can count the number of

13:55.597 --> 13:58.941
scholars on one hand, two hands, or the number of 
distinguished departments, if you look at the

14:00.153 --> 14:25.879
rankings wherever they come from, whether it's 
the number of publications or whatever,

14:00.153 --> 14:25.879
it's not of the stature that it should be given the 
resources that have been put into it. Are you

14:27.681 --> 14:28.962
shaking your head? That you hear me or that you 
agree? No, I'm saying I hear you and I understand

14:31.327 --> 14:34.111
the point you make. Now, do you want to conclude 
with that point? What more is there to say? No, I

14:39.278 --> 14:42.943
don't want to conclude with that point because I 
don't want that on the record. I don't want anybody

14:42.983 --> 14:44.425
else to see that. Oh, okay. Well, when it's typed up 
and we give it back to you. I'll scratch that out.

14:50.733 --> 14:50.933
All right. How would you like this interview to 
end, then? What statements would you like at the

14:54.038 --> 14:55.860
end of it?

15:01.342 --> 15:08.693
That's what I thought I was asking when I was 
saying, what do you think, how do you feel about

15:01.342 --> 15:08.693
this institution in general?

15:09.475 --> 15:27.923
I think that given the milieu, that is given Texas, 
given the Texas heritage, given what

15:09.475 --> 15:27.923
Texas is, that this is about as good as this 
university can be. I think in general terms

15:29.725 --> 15:50.108
University of Texas in Austin is a more 
distinguished institution and I don't

15:29.725 --> 15:50.108
understand why Texas A&M can't outshine the 
University of Texas at Austin. I understand why

15:50.508 --> 15:52.811
we're not as good as Rice. I don't have a problem 
with that. I understand why in many respects we're

15:59.932 --> 16:04.599
a better institution than SMU or Baylor.

16:08.204 --> 16:21.104
But why we can't have the student body, of course 
turning that around a certain number of people

16:08.204 --> 16:21.104
will say that's the strength of the institution. 
We don't have the student body, the grungy hop

16:25.885 --> 16:27.827
potheads or whatever they are at Austin. We don't 
have them. That's the strength of this university

16:29.009 --> 16:34.996
for many of the parents, maybe for many of the 
faculty, for the regents. And so what I'm saying is

16:35.657 --> 16:43.767
antithetical to exactly what is wanted of Texas 
A&M University. It is what the people who have it,

16:44.107 --> 16:49.574
who own it, want of it. This is not the University of 
Texas at Austin. Haskell, the last thing I want to

16:56.615 --> 16:59.993
say off the record, I apologize
