WEBVTT

00:07.895 --> 00:16.489
about sorting out the prisoners according

00:07.895 --> 00:16.489
to beliefs, et cetera. Because we didn't know 
that. We had no idea that this was taking place. And

00:21.877 --> 00:24.081
we did have one guy, I do remember, an officer who 
interviewed various people, you know, about

00:25.192 --> 00:30.459
whatever we wanted to talk about. I was kind of like 
a psychiatrist. Now tell me when this took place. I

00:35.905 --> 00:37.187
don't remember which camp. It was not my last camp. 
It was before that. Because I had about four or five

00:40.511 --> 00:44.356
camps. And I do remember an interview. That would 
be interesting if anything. If that was the

00:52.006 --> 00:54.709
program that... You mentioned where they started 
to look for the politics in prison. We didn't think

01:00.930 --> 01:04.955
we had any politics because we felt we were just 
soldiers. And besides, we felt whatever you

01:05.155 --> 01:13.525
believed in, that was okay because that's what you 
do. Were you political before you became one of the

01:14.947 --> 01:18.131
Army? No, not really. Because you were growing up 
during chaotic times. Very much. So my friends, my

01:24.304 --> 01:27.208
best friend was. And they tried to recruit me 
several times. But first of all, you had to pay

01:31.956 --> 01:35.221
dues. And they wanted me to join and promise you 
better jobs and all that kind of stuff. Kind of like

01:46.138 --> 01:48.141
a union, take care of you. Right. But I only did, I 
think I did one tennis clinic. And I may have done

01:55.308 --> 02:00.053
some ski clinics and things like that. Because I 
was into sports, into my own personal sports.

02:03.356 --> 02:03.676
Right. In which I was excelling quite well, 
because I was champion, Middle Silesia, or Middle

02:03.696 --> 02:15.428
Silesian tennis champion. That's 18 and under. 
Yes. And also, I won a few races in skiing. And I was

02:23.967 --> 02:25.309
entering tournaments. So I was what you would call 
a tournament player. And I was enjoying my skill.

02:32.157 --> 02:35.961
And there weren't that many, so that was my forte, 
so to speak. And I didn't want to get into any of

02:36.501 --> 02:40.206
these marches and things like that. I didn't care 
for that. I do remember I volunteered once to go way

02:45.131 --> 02:49.476
out in some village kind of to teach some songs, and 
some of them were English songs. I don't quite, it

02:59.158 --> 03:18.197
doesn't quite, I do remember there was some 
voluntary work that I did, because I had more

02:59.158 --> 03:18.197
education than most of the, at least the villages 
around the middle of Schlesien, they're all rural

02:59.158 --> 03:18.197
people, you know. But I never got into the 
mainstream of this Nazi movement. Like my friend

03:25.360 --> 03:33.691
Horst Trispel, which I have a picture of, who rose 
rapidly in it, became kind of stars. And then when

03:34.592 --> 03:41.080
the army got him, he immediately rose to captain 
and got into pairs. Well, you didn't get involved

03:41.380 --> 03:55.595
in the political side. No, for the personal 
reasons, because I was already involved in my own

03:55.955 --> 04:05.245
sports and so forth. And they would have tennis 
tournaments that were probably sponsored by the

04:09.983 --> 04:13.588
state, maybe. That I don't know. Because they just 
said, you go to Breslau and there's a tennis

04:15.370 --> 04:20.396
tournament. You're entered and you play. That's 
all I know. So that was my association with the

04:26.644 --> 04:32.292
party. And I did have a lot of problems in my teens, 
health problems, strangely enough. I used to tell

04:40.342 --> 04:42.184
Jean about it. I had pneumonia twice. My poor 
mother had to nurse me through those things. Plus

04:49.231 --> 04:51.574
diphtheria. A hard case of diphtheria where I 
almost died. And they just came out with this new

04:54.797 --> 04:57.320
serum. And they said, okay, we'll try it out on you. 
If he makes it, fine. If it works, fine. If not. And

05:02.645 --> 05:03.926
so it worked. But I was paralyzed in one leg from the 
serum. They told me you either break out with some

05:08.759 --> 05:15.509
kind of skin disease or you get paralyzed by that 
serum because it was new. So that took, you might

05:16.330 --> 05:25.444
say, two and a half, three years out of growing up 
years, out of my teenage years. I was in

05:26.366 --> 05:27.407
quarantine. My classmates had to throw flowers in 
my window. They weren't allowed to see me because

05:31.253 --> 05:35.880
it was... I really was not in the main, I was not that 
well sometimes, so I would bounce right back and

05:36.147 --> 05:51.410
get back into it, but then I had trouble catching up 
again, which happened to me in school one day after

05:36.147 --> 05:51.410
diphtheria. I just couldn't catch up with the 
classes. So I had to make one class over and I had a

05:56.978 --> 06:05.310
little more trouble then because they came behind 
me with French They already had four years of

06:05.695 --> 06:11.707
French and I only had maybe two years of French, you 
see. But I had more English. What caused you to

06:13.730 --> 06:15.594
learn English? That was more or less part of our 
curriculum. You either took English or you took

06:20.022 --> 06:23.169
French. The Ober-Rial school in Schweidens. They 
had two types of schools that you've probably

06:27.937 --> 06:32.484
heard of. One called the gymnasium, and the ones 
that became doctors and lawyers, they took Latin

06:32.504 --> 06:45.442
there, and they became, it was right next door to 
us, we shared the same soccer league. And the ones

06:45.462 --> 06:50.890
that could add and had a little feeling for 
drawings and so on, They went the other way and

06:51.899 --> 07:00.728
became artists or engineers and architects and so 
on.

07:00.748 --> 07:02.169
And they went to the overall schools and they had 
different curriculum. How did you get drawn into

07:02.189 --> 07:03.711
the Army? The war was on. I was way deferred, part of 
it. I was still a student.

07:13.921 --> 07:18.666
And then I think I volunteered for another type of 
service, which was working somewhere in East

07:19.135 --> 07:25.101
Prussia. We built drainage in the marshes. We 
drained the ditches. We had no guns or anything. We

07:33.310 --> 07:37.675
had a volunteer company.

07:37.695 --> 07:46.965
And when I came back, in fact, I do remember we were, 
some of us were supposed to go to the big Nuremberg

07:37.695 --> 07:46.965
thing. But it was canceled because of some 
invasion. I don't recall which country was

07:52.368 --> 07:55.692
invaded at the time. Because it did happen so fast, 
I will

07:55.712 --> 08:08.106
probably get, once I sit down and reconstruct it, I 
can probably figure out which one. And so when I

08:08.126 --> 08:09.207
came back, I was trying to be to Artaud. And my 
friend had already been in there a year or so. Been

08:12.631 --> 08:13.932
to Paris.

08:16.105 --> 08:18.408
Oh, so if he had been to Paris, it was after 1940. 
Yeah, so it was quite late, you see. Poland was

08:21.191 --> 08:22.733
attacked in 1939. France fell in the spring of 
1940. So if he had been to Paris, it would have to

08:26.537 --> 08:31.983
have been after the summer of 1940.

08:32.043 --> 08:34.206
We'll find that out from the record.

08:36.328 --> 08:38.251
And then I got sick again in the army. I had another 
bout with pneumonia. I had this horrible...

08:45.215 --> 08:51.524
And the coldest place, even colder than my 
hometown, Olin, I think it was. Olau. Olau.

08:54.708 --> 08:58.473
O-H-L-A-U was the name of that town I was stationed 
in. And it was one of the artillery units with

08:59.594 --> 09:03.279
horses. The coldest place. And I come back from 
exercises

09:04.962 --> 09:13.073
one day, and I just killed it. And I would die in the 
morning. So back to the... several months,

09:14.459 --> 09:23.452
and then I got reassigned to another unit. Your 
parents are still alive. There's one sister. One

09:26.497 --> 09:30.623
sister and my brother are still alive. At that 
time, yes. Yes, your sister is Lottie. And your

09:35.150 --> 09:38.615
brother's name was what? Paul. Paul.

09:42.286 --> 09:49.252
He'd just gotten married, and he got married, and 
my sister got married just before I... But I was...

09:49.272 --> 09:51.254
She married Herbert. Herbert, yeah. Now, some of 
my time is probably not quite accurate, because

09:53.375 --> 10:11.871
while I was in that artillery with the horses on 
maneuvers one time, I had this horrible accident

09:53.375 --> 10:11.871
where that horse kicked me while I was in the saddle 
and broke my shinbone. And it did not heal. And they

10:16.114 --> 10:21.060
were talking about cutting my leg off.

10:21.080 --> 10:24.384
So there I was out again for several months. And I 
really didn't think I was going to make 30 at the

10:24.824 --> 10:31.493
rate I was going. I mean, I was bombed with these 
things all the time. So I do remember I had that

10:39.475 --> 10:42.398
pneumonia and then that accident. And that seemed 
to, by then, that was it. And then I seemed to be all

10:45.642 --> 10:50.207
right after that. And I spent most of my time, for 
some obscure reason, I spent most of my time as a

10:50.227 --> 10:56.253
drill instructor.

10:59.517 --> 11:06.985
Just everybody was coming through, going to 
various fronts, and I was assigned to drilling.

11:07.488 --> 11:12.895
You know, basic, fundamental, mostly right and 
left. Discipline, plain discipline. Well, that

11:15.739 --> 11:21.186
was probably because you were ill and you were 
being recycled each time as people came through

11:15.739 --> 11:21.186
and went on. You were allowed to heal. Yeah. I'm 
sure I had some because my assignments were really

11:24.450 --> 11:30.598
strange because everybody else was going 
someplace or was being promoted. You know,

11:31.499 --> 11:33.462
nothing happened to me. I was kind of in a 
backwater, so to speak. And finally... We'll find

11:37.040 --> 11:45.529
out when the record's coming from Germany, we may 
see a little notation on the side that says, this

11:37.040 --> 11:45.529
man is too important to send to battle. We need to 
keep him as a drill instructor here in Natural

11:46.550 --> 11:52.737
Leader.

11:52.817 --> 11:59.204
Yeah, and they said I was a good drill instructor 
because I had a good voice, good presence. What was

12:01.227 --> 12:02.588
your rank at this time? just over-cannoneer. 
That's the strange thing. I never get promoted.

12:06.934 --> 12:09.618
There was another thing. But I, the training 
method, contrary to what most people think, that

12:10.499 --> 12:27.343
at least that we used, was a very, was more of role,

12:10.499 --> 12:27.343
not reversal, but playing In other words, just 
because I might be assigned to take the whole

12:28.049 --> 12:36.701
battalion out, you see, and we changed that 
around. The guy in command, the two, the officers

12:38.003 --> 12:42.149
may never show up. And then somebody else in charge 
says, Dennis, you take them all out there and take

12:43.031 --> 12:48.218
them up that hill. Or something, you see. So you got 
to take command. Yes. And then they'd say, okay,

12:53.329 --> 12:58.137
now go back to your rank, whatever that was, you 
see. And I never heard people say that so much, you

12:58.658 --> 13:01.142
know. They always think it's very rigid. It 
wasn't. My training was not. So I was used to taking

13:05.448 --> 13:11.197
command of large groups of people. Right. without 
ever having any rank, which is even harder. Yes,

13:14.654 --> 13:16.017
yes. But they must have listened to you. Yeah, so 
you had to have some voice and some presence. And it

13:20.625 --> 13:27.216
was funny, later on, when I was teaching skiing, I 
could take command of a class in the middle of a

13:20.625 --> 13:27.216
blizzard. And my boss, Bill Klein, used to say, 
Dennis, tone down your voice. Everybody can hear

13:32.487 --> 13:35.010
you from down below. Down at the lodge, they could 
listen to my listen. My instruction was a thousand

13:37.193 --> 13:40.197
feet up. My voice is so clear. And that air, too, 
also in the cold air. Yeah, in the cold air. So this

13:48.708 --> 13:51.472
was about 1942? 1942, I would say. 1942. And then 
somehow you went from here to Africa. Oh, then

13:59.042 --> 14:09.832
finally I got an assignment as a K.O.B., Creeks 
Officer Reverber. And they said they were going to

14:09.972 --> 14:14.216
send me to school in Heidelberg. And that was the 
interesting one when I met the fellow that married

14:16.498 --> 14:23.304
my girlfriend. Yes, I remember. Yes. was my older 
lieutenant and instructor. Oh, was that right?

14:30.250 --> 14:30.390
Yeah. So you couldn't get too angry after that. No. 
And they really put us to the paces there. And that

14:36.158 --> 14:38.521
very short time was when I was concentrated. It was 
more testing and what your aptitudes were rather

14:39.062 --> 14:44.189
than teaching. I didn't teach much, but they 
wanted to know what you knew. Like, for instance,

14:47.153 --> 14:54.223
that escape thing I told you about, where they just 
simply tested you and said, now, okay, now we're

14:47.153 --> 14:54.223
going to, You're going to escape from your 
prisoner and you're going to escape. They're

14:58.520 --> 15:07.211
going to let you free on one downtown Heidelberg 
and you're going to make your way over there to this

14:58.520 --> 15:07.211
corner.

15:10.335 --> 15:14.760
Everything is going to be graded, obviously.

15:15.550 --> 15:16.992
I just took the streetcar. I thought that was a good 
way to get there. The fastest way. Sure. Never mind

15:20.797 --> 15:23.701
walking in the back side streets and alleys. So, 
but as I looked, I could see some officers standing

15:24.041 --> 15:32.793
on the street, you know, checking me. So I ducked

15:32.813 --> 15:40.022
behind the seat and the passenger car looked and 
kind of laughed and smiled, but they didn't. throw

15:40.694 --> 15:42.777
a big commotion on me. So I got right past those 
officers. They let me through, got through, and I

15:45.500 --> 15:49.005
got back. So that was my one and only, and it was not 
anything they taught me, nothing like a big

15:49.025 --> 15:55.513
course, survival course or anything like that. It 
was just a test. Can you, I'll drop you there and can

15:56.575 --> 16:03.344
you make it across town without being caught? Or 
the soul book. I think that added to your sense that

16:04.946 --> 16:06.668
you could

16:10.512 --> 16:12.634
Yes, exactly. Exactly, it did.

16:17.379 --> 16:32.595
And another thing gave me courage while I was 
agonizing over escaping, which took several

16:17.379 --> 16:32.595
weeks and hours, and even before the actual break, 
I never... Oh, now we're in camp, we're at Deming,

16:17.379 --> 16:32.595
at Lordsburg. At Deming, yeah. But I do remember, 
in answer to your question, Kenny, I do remember, I

16:33.857 --> 16:40.063
was still a student, And people, strangers were 
coming into Schweidnitz. Up to that point, all

16:43.339 --> 16:47.305
strangers, we would know everybody in that small 
town. And I remember one time, and I still have it in

16:47.926 --> 16:56.798
my mind, this little park, and a strange young man 
walked through. And I thought to myself, he could

16:57.639 --> 16:59.903
be a spy. We would not know. And we would not bother 
him because he didn't do anything to us. He could

17:04.529 --> 17:06.192
just walk through. But it occurred to me that 
people could walk in strange places. Yes. And even

17:14.559 --> 17:20.913
though other people might be suspicious, but they 
would probably, if you were lucky, let you get by.

17:21.194 --> 17:21.414
Yes. If you didn't do anything real dumb. To call 
attention to yourself. Yeah. That's a good lesson

17:27.227 --> 17:28.410
to have learned. Later on, you know that you could 
walk through a place. Yeah, I always thought he

17:31.076 --> 17:34.140
looked like a spy. That's what I thought. I thought 
he was going to spy in a little town. He was even

17:38.165 --> 17:40.929
calling attention to himself. He wasn't causing 
any harm. Yeah.

17:48.258 --> 17:51.242
So you found yourself assigned to Heidelberg. And 
at the end of this course, there was a which was

17:57.803 --> 18:13.085
Rwanda's course, which I, by the way, was among the 
first top five graduating.

18:13.105 --> 18:14.748
It must have been about 400 guys. They immediately 
came out with a little note on the bulletin board

18:14.768 --> 18:19.795
for volunteers for Africa. And there I agonized 
again, because I thought for sure they knew by now

18:22.272 --> 18:33.631
that I had taught skiing, cross-country skiing to 
the soldiers, toward Russia. And I thought for

18:33.651 --> 18:35.795
sure they had it already in my file. But I went in, 
and that Oberlutend was the only guy, I had to see

18:36.576 --> 18:40.703
him, the guy that Married your sweetie. Yeah, 
married my sweetie. I had to go see him, and I said, I

18:44.545 --> 19:00.767
did not, because I came from the eastern part of 
Europe, and I had read all the books on WWI, what

18:44.545 --> 19:00.767
happened to those guys in Russia, and you don't 
even have to go to war. Just to be there is a terrible

19:00.887 --> 19:05.053
thing. Just to be there is enough. Plus those 
miserable weapons, if you ever... In sub-zero

19:10.619 --> 19:17.489
weather, you touch one of those guns or your hands, 
you lose half of your skin. I mean, these things

19:17.669 --> 19:19.231
alone. It's crazy to volunteer for that kind of 
stuff. I felt I'd rather my bones can stay in the sun

19:23.097 --> 19:30.948
and get dried out by the sun in Africa. That sounds 
reasonable. I would vote for that. My father

19:34.173 --> 19:35.635
fought in the First World War. The Austrian Army 
Column College. the Kaiser-Empire Army, the

19:39.762 --> 19:44.448
Austro-Hungarian Army. He was down in the Italian 
front, fighting the Italians along the Piave

19:44.508 --> 19:55.203
River. So they accepted you for the African? Yeah, 
I was surprised. They accepted me and shipped me

19:58.687 --> 20:00.730
off to Greece. And there's my little eagle eyes 
that I picked going over the Brenna Pass. They only

20:08.020 --> 20:09.702
grow in... above timber and

20:10.070 --> 20:35.048
it

20:10.070 --> 20:35.048
shows where i was in the hospital as mentioned in 
there oh yeah these these little inserts are

20:10.070 --> 20:35.048
interesting because i tell you what to do how to 
behave as a prisoner of

20:10.070 --> 20:35.048
war and help Guard your health. Oh, yes, yes, here 
on the inside, yes. Oh, I see. This is to remember.

20:44.587 --> 20:49.395
The soul book must be kept in, always kept in order. 
Everything must be entered. Your soldier's book

20:54.143 --> 20:57.508
is your No, no, no. Go ahead. They took it away from 
me. Yeah, I would have thrown it away. Who did it?

21:19.056 --> 21:20.178
Who did it? Oh, I see.

21:25.744 --> 21:27.867
Yeah. How did she have

21:28.032 --> 21:39.127
gotten this? How

21:39.527 --> 21:57.752
did she get this?

21:58.002 --> 22:03.849
Well, that's great. How would they have gotten it? 
This had to be carried with you as you were captured

22:05.831 --> 22:09.896
from camp to camp. This was sealed into an 
envelope, and each commanding officer passed it

22:10.056 --> 22:15.782
along to each new commanding officer. Yes, that's 
correct. So somehow, maybe when you left, maybe

22:16.723 --> 22:24.272
when you slipped out, they couldn't find you after 
a certain period of time. The war was over. They may

22:25.390 --> 22:26.533
have sent this to you. Yeah, they may have. That's 
part of the official papers. But the most touching

22:29.602 --> 22:33.494
part of it is we got all through the book, and now I'm 
here. Yes. I'm taking everything. Sure, sure. The

22:38.654 --> 22:44.723
Adelweiss.

22:45.264 --> 22:53.297
How do

22:45.264 --> 22:53.297
you like that? Well, usually

22:53.537 --> 23:00.949
the unit picture went in here. The picture of the 
platoon or the picture of the squad was... often

23:07.730 --> 23:08.851
kept in there. But this is even nicer. Doesn't that 
tell you a good luck that you're telling us? Yes, it

23:13.776 --> 23:14.057
is. It's kind of a good luck flower. Yes, it is.

23:20.764 --> 23:28.172
This is how it would be to act as a prisoner.

23:28.732 --> 23:35.880
Wenn du das Unglück hast, when you are unfortunate 
enough to be taken prisoner, Well, you

23:36.232 --> 23:53.791
had no idea when you got this that you would have the 
unblick.

24:01.299 --> 24:02.340
But the Germans... as you well know have this 
system of hands-on promotion in other words you

24:02.776 --> 24:30.724
know in order to become an officer you have to go to 
the front first you can't just go to school same i

24:02.776 --> 24:30.724
was going to be an architect and i had to learn a 
trade so i became a mason and i in fact i gave that

24:31.193 --> 24:36.378
answer to whoever wrote the book, Mason, as my 
occupation. And it was later crossed out that I was

24:36.759 --> 24:45.087
a student, because it's confusing, you know, 
because I really wasn't going to be a Mason. But you

24:45.347 --> 24:49.852
had to be a Mason to even get into the school. You had 
to show proof of a trade. So that's the hands-on

24:53.335 --> 24:59.662
type.

24:59.682 --> 25:00.863
How did you go from How did you get to, you went to 
Italy, and then from Italy to Greece, and then from

25:01.687 --> 25:06.351
Greece to Tunisia? No, first to Greece. To Greece. 
Yeah. And Rommel was retreating from Al-Alamin

25:09.915 --> 25:22.486
across North Africa faster than we could catch up 
with him. That's my impression now. I'm just

25:24.288 --> 25:28.251
trying to find the dates, because the date of 
transport would be here. Yeah, that should be in

25:28.271 --> 25:28.892
there. And I was sent to Africa in one of those 
younger planes. I have a picture that I might have

25:38.459 --> 25:40.763
sent you. And I got so deathly sick. And they 
dropped me off in Crete where they were refueling.

25:47.854 --> 25:49.817
I just simply heaved everything out. And both 
hands, I was just awful sick.

25:56.107 --> 25:57.529
By the time I got up, They decided not to. I had no 
more planes going to North Africa or whatever, but

26:00.194 --> 26:14.809
they sent me back and I went to Israel to catch up 
with my unit, which was retreating in North

26:00.194 --> 26:14.809
Africa. So they tried to go around this way, and I 
got sick and stayed in Crete, but my buddies did get

26:14.829 --> 26:24.479
over there. Because when I caught up with them a 
week or so Ten days later, they were already there.

26:32.585 --> 26:38.633
I was right at the tail end of the battle of Tobruk. 
Now, these are boys that you went through school

26:38.653 --> 26:41.817
with, I see. Two or three guys that were in the same 
class. Have you ever, well, I certainly wouldn't

26:47.124 --> 26:51.851
have heard from them since, or you wouldn't have 
contacted them. My father did. No kidding. He

26:53.853 --> 26:56.777
heard from them, because he searched for me. Yes, I 
saw the article. Yeah, and so some of them answered

26:58.682 --> 27:03.069
him when they went to school. And, in fact, one of my 
nieces sent me a letter also to get in touch with one

27:03.349 --> 27:12.062
of the guys that, which I haven't done yet, but I 
have to get it. Oh, nice. That's nice. So you went to

27:15.487 --> 27:16.649
meet your school. These were school chums. They 
were in the same unit.

27:25.021 --> 27:25.161
Mm-hmm. Something motorized

27:26.896 --> 27:38.227
me. I came right in the middle of a dual

27:38.247 --> 27:52.781
artillery barrage when I reported in.

27:52.801 --> 27:56.464
And I remember the first thing you learn is that you 
dig your own foxhole. Was that right? You're not

27:59.104 --> 28:01.086
allowed in anybody else's box. Oh, was that right? 
They threw you out? As soon as the first barrage

28:03.388 --> 28:07.152
came in, you try to head for cover, and they throw 
you out. You've got to dig your own. Find out who

28:09.974 --> 28:11.396
your friends are. Yeah, right.

28:15.419 --> 28:17.741
So they were retreating. You joined the unit about 
10 days late. And you came in the middle of an

28:21.645 --> 28:26.029
artillery barrage. At the end of, near Tobruk.

28:32.720 --> 28:36.023
And from then on it was just one retreat after 
another. We were just retreating. Just stop and

28:38.104 --> 28:43.029
then fire and stop and run again and see more 
foxholes. I must have dug hundreds of foxholes

28:43.109 --> 28:45.211
every night. New foxhole because the P-38s would 
come and come over us and shoot like, you know,

28:45.831 --> 28:53.438
flying over. So you had to have cover on. Yes. Oh,

28:56.654 --> 29:00.662
I see. Which is hard to explain. One here. Which is, 
is there slight loss? I forget

29:08.638 --> 29:16.013
which side you stand on, but... It's really 
terrible.

29:22.979 --> 29:26.284
We didn't have any of these earplugs. The American 
soldiers had earplugs, but they carried little

29:26.304 --> 29:34.717
plastic things,

29:26.304 --> 29:34.717
I'd say. Invisible sound and smell. Yes, sure, the 
acrid acid smell. And I've never really heard any,

29:42.453 --> 29:51.210
I know they make a lot of movies, but I can't quite 
capture it now. Is it the sound they can't capture,

29:51.511 --> 29:55.579
or the noise, or the smell? Well, of course the 
smell they can, but it's the... when the fragments

30:01.032 --> 30:11.843
start, after the thing hits, which is a very scary 
thing, wherever it hits, nearby or something,

30:01.032 --> 30:11.843
everything seems nearby. Once, after it 
explodes, you can hear these fragments, you know,

30:12.904 --> 30:25.517
you can almost see them, you can, because they make 
different sounds, you know, these fragments, how

30:12.904 --> 30:25.517
they zing all over the place. That's the scary part 
because you think, you know, You have no

30:28.100 --> 30:30.102
protection against these things. You're just 
standing there practically naked. At least the

30:32.444 --> 30:36.207
old knights had some armor. I feel sorry. I mean, 
the soldiers are just, they feel terrible. They

30:41.292 --> 30:44.575
feel so naked. Well, Gene says I finally get to tell 
my war stories. Yes. I have never, so you have to

30:50.601 --> 30:53.664
kind of pardon me if I get carried away. Not pardon 
you at all. I want to encourage you to think of any

30:54.304 --> 30:57.347
story that...

31:04.330 --> 31:12.781
We

31:04.330 --> 31:12.781
were in a camp outside. I saw the Pope. I got blessed 
by the Pope. Oh, my gosh. Yeah. At the time, you have

31:19.068 --> 31:20.130
to... I just am not too accurate. We have to fit it 
all in. It's going to fit all in. Yeah. The records

31:26.057 --> 31:27.779
will give us the time slots. But... we i even went to 
pompeii saw the schmutz the uh the schmutz on the

31:30.993 --> 31:58.131
walls the pompeii went to see the pope he blessed my 
rose and crowns my rosemary yes which i sent back

31:30.993 --> 31:58.131
home and then we were camped outside rome i suppose 
what's naples naples I mean, there's nothing much

31:58.685 --> 32:05.594
or anything waiting for them to get over there for 
some transfer. And a lot of it is kind of hazy

32:05.614 --> 32:11.282
because you're getting close to the battle zone 
and you get kind of scared. Sure. So you're 22 years

32:11.642 --> 32:12.423
old? About 22, 23.

32:19.412 --> 32:25.300
So it gets pretty scary the closer you get, you 
know. And then we just ran most of the time. Stop,

32:32.286 --> 32:38.715
dig another foxhole, shoot off some rounds, run 
again. You were firing rifles, or this is still

32:38.735 --> 32:40.917
artillery? No, this is artillery. They called 
them storm artillery for some reason. Because it

32:45.804 --> 32:47.826
was a different kind of warfare. Rommel invented 
that kind of stuff, that just hit and run kind of

32:49.128 --> 32:53.513
thing. That was his forte. In fact, he got killed. a 
few days after I arrived. And we were told he was

33:00.431 --> 33:07.938
shot by a strafing plane when he actually killed 
himself. So he knew what was going on. We

33:09.199 --> 33:15.605
didn't know. In other words, in general, I forgot. 
He did come

33:16.986 --> 33:21.130
by one time. He was a short guy. Juan Arnim. Juan 
Arnim, I think. A-R-N-I-M. the day when they i had

33:26.688 --> 33:55.260
my orders to go what is that that german academy for 
the officers there was in berlin it's the same as um

33:26.688 --> 33:55.260
yeah but that wasn't no no the regular i can for the 
life of me instead of west point yes and i had my

33:26.688 --> 33:55.260
orders to go there for the final schooling. Now, 
this isn't in North Africa. It's before North

33:59.706 --> 34:00.747
Africa. After North Africa? Oh, yeah. This was my 
hands-on. I had my battlefront experience. And

34:06.693 --> 34:08.635
now I got the orders. And at the same time when the 
orders came through, they said, you can't go

34:08.675 --> 34:13.440
because we're surrounded. So, it's to stay where 
you are. And

34:18.245 --> 34:22.350
then we just sat. They said, stay in your foxholes. 
until you get more orders, and we stayed in there

34:25.852 --> 34:29.396
for a couple of days. It seemed like I was reading a 
book and waiting for something to happen. I didn't

34:33.520 --> 34:43.391
know if anybody was going to come by with machine 
guns or what, but actually nobody came by.

34:43.411 --> 34:49.277
They kept the command intact almost, and our 
officers took us in. And then they were separated

34:50.185 --> 34:54.853
into officer camps and so forth. And we were 
separated into non-commissioned officer camps

34:54.873 --> 35:00.982
and so on. But the captors didn't come in with 
machine guns. But you don't know. So you were

35:07.313 --> 35:14.464
trapped in an area after a long series of retreats. 
You got your orders to... go to Berlin to the

35:17.894 --> 35:45.825
officers academy found out that there was no place 
to go because you couldn't leave because

35:17.894 --> 35:45.825
everybody was trapped so the and your officers 
simply said this stay and sit tight and someone's

35:17.894 --> 35:45.825
going to either come and get us or we're going to get 
out of it or something's going to happen but we're

35:17.894 --> 35:45.825
going to sit tight do anything okay your your rank 
at the time was what um my rank was I think uh I was

35:46.868 --> 35:56.201
made under-officer right about that time, 
actually. I was promoted. Yeah, I was just

35:57.382 --> 36:00.467
promoted then for my trip back. They made me 
under-officer. Second lieutenant. No, it

36:07.076 --> 36:15.567
was a sergeant. Sergeant. I don't know. no well 
it's higher than a third of the german army which

36:16.585 --> 36:39.640
was uh private's importance so you found yourself 
uh waiting sitting around for a couple of days

36:16.585 --> 36:39.640
reading a book uh concerned that the next people 
you would see would be either british or americans

36:16.585 --> 36:39.640
or did you know which ones which one But you knew 
that you were trapped. Because the British used a

36:41.704 --> 36:44.648
lot of foreign troops. They used Indian troops. 
That's right. They had the Khyber riflemen coming

36:47.891 --> 36:52.177
in. Yes. But you knew that you were trapped, and you 
knew that the next thing... They were surrounded.

36:56.021 --> 36:57.523
They were surrounded, so it was going to be a 
surrender. No mercy. Right.

37:01.968 --> 37:03.991
Did you have any close hand-to-hand combat? No. 
This is all... I think I mentioned that episode in

37:05.624 --> 37:14.194
the letter, because we wouldn't even know what to 
do in close combat. We had no weapons for close

37:14.214 --> 37:16.797
combat. That's right, no pistols, sure. We had no 
handguns. Never issued, in fact, nobody in the

37:21.022 --> 37:25.147
German Army has. I know we didn't have any.

37:30.293 --> 37:33.336
And we only had these great big guns, so what do you 
do? They were only good for 10 kilometers or

37:33.940 --> 37:37.224
something like that. They were hauled by 
motorized units. There was one in the more

37:41.791 --> 37:53.206
modern

37:41.791 --> 37:53.206
armies. So the first people you saw when you were 
sitting in the foxhole reading were American

37:58.510 --> 38:01.114
soldiers or British soldiers? No, no foreign 
soldiers. Nobody? Nobody, no. Your officers?

38:04.038 --> 38:07.003
They just said, get out of your foxhole and follow 
these guys. So they, whoever made the sign that

38:08.305 --> 38:21.264
surrendered,

38:08.305 --> 38:21.264
you know, said we were bringing our own troops and 
returning them to whoever won. There was a lot that

38:22.666 --> 38:24.969
took them in on this. It took a lot to cross their 
lines. So

38:29.358 --> 38:51.913
we

38:29.358 --> 38:51.913
just marched in single file and pretty soon one of 
our guys came out and the British took us away. We

38:51.933 --> 38:52.674
were in some camps and some oasis. And it was, not 
much was happening. And they moved us every so

38:53.415 --> 38:54.657
often, it seemed like, in the east. until

38:55.042 --> 39:00.850
you were taken over by the Americans. So you were 
actually guarded by British troops. The line is

39:05.916 --> 39:11.404
getting larger and larger as more troops are being 
brought in from different battles in different

39:05.916 --> 39:11.404
areas. And then you're being funneled in a way 
farther and farther east toward the larger camps

39:12.065 --> 39:22.078
under the hands of the British holding camp.

39:27.172 --> 39:46.030
Well,

39:27.172 --> 39:46.030
Steve, I always

39:27.172 --> 39:46.030
throw off

39:27.172 --> 39:46.030
the direction that you're going, so I can take 
where it is. You're remembering a lot of things

39:46.050 --> 39:50.534
now, and some of the times you've said it's hard to 
remember. Details. I'm curious, since revealing

39:50.934 --> 39:54.338
this to Jim, have you begun to have a lot more 
memories of things coming back to you, or were

39:50.934 --> 39:54.338
these as well-retained all the time? Was it 
something you could dwell on all the time, so it

39:54.358 --> 39:55.879
stayed in your mind? I may have on some aspects like 
when I was you know I was alone a lot for the first few

39:57.192 --> 40:24.499
years you know in small rooms I may have dwelled on 
it but once I got out and made new friends which was

39:57.192 --> 40:24.499
great because then I didn't have to think about it 
and once I had some social contacts and especially

39:57.192 --> 40:24.499
once I got married it was even In fact, Gene always 
quotes me. It's one of my, when I said, marriage is

40:27.932 --> 40:31.296
so time consuming. You

40:31.337 --> 40:38.126
have no time to think, which is great, you think. 
Keeps you, keeps the memories at bay. Yeah. So it

40:43.534 --> 40:51.486
was very therapeutic to see all these new images 
and new experiences were coming in, you know,

40:43.534 --> 40:51.486
children and so on. But before that, of course, I 
had also my social life was not too bad, I had a lot of

40:55.377 --> 40:59.764
good friends, male friends.

41:01.066 --> 41:17.470
This guy that gave me the first job, real decent 
job, as an estimator salesman,

41:01.066 --> 41:17.470
I had somehow found the university courts at 
Berkeley. And there were a lot of foreign students

41:18.023 --> 41:27.779
there at the time, so my accent didn't show up very 
much, so I felt comfortable. Whatever story,

41:27.799 --> 41:32.126
cover story I had would probably hold. And I made 
some real good friends. One of them was a Turk. And

41:38.003 --> 42:01.800
he

41:38.003 --> 42:01.800
kind of became my mentor because he knew more and he 
had gone to school for a while and had a very good

41:38.003 --> 42:01.800
job, a fabulous job with MasterCard, with the 
founder of MasterCard. If you can believe that. So

42:04.480 --> 42:06.983
he had lots of money. And he was a very generous guy. 
And a lot of fun to be with. And we played a lot of

42:12.971 --> 42:14.053
tennis. And then I met some of our professors that I 
played with. And I was quite a good player. So they

42:20.521 --> 42:22.965
liked to play with me. And I had a real good group 
there. We'd have a lot of beer and pizza parties.

42:27.370 --> 42:29.273
And then we'd sit around the round table. The real, 
the old, what do they call them, Greek symposium

42:29.759 --> 42:41.710
type thing where everybody can stand up and make 
their speeches. Well, we took it literally, and we

42:41.875 --> 42:43.818
did it. And we had a beer and pizza on a rainy day like 
this for hours. And Sadat would pick up the bill,

42:48.226 --> 42:52.032
$20, whatever it was, and he'd pay. So we'd all chip 
in. I mean, you know, which was fun, if you can drink

42:54.977 --> 43:03.071
five or six hours of beer and pizza and talk your 
head off and anything under the sun. So there was

43:03.111 --> 43:05.755
marvelous. Thanks. Oh, that's a good question. 
See, these are the small details that I have. Well,

43:20.917 --> 43:28.107
the German army will give books to their front line 
people. Like, every night the canteen comes in,

43:28.148 --> 43:33.455
you can hear the pots. In fact, they seem to be 
eating the other side also, because there's very

43:38.390 --> 43:43.661
little firing during that time, during eating 
time. During eating time? Yeah. No army wants to

43:44.663 --> 43:45.685
break up. No, no. Dinner. And they sent out, they 
bring out books, and I remember it was a marvelous

43:48.211 --> 43:53.923
love story. Yeah, sure. It was a marvelous love 
story about a man, kind of a refugee of some sort,

43:57.357 --> 44:08.647
from the Russian army or something, that he was a 
fugitive. And he had found some woman, a woman that

44:11.029 --> 44:19.677
took him on, that took him in, and it was a great love 
story.

44:22.380 --> 44:24.782
And I always thought that, you know, Yeah, it was my 
great love story, you see. Oh, nice. Yes, it is.

44:32.987 --> 44:33.668
Yes, it is. Yeah, it was a... Yes, that's nice. I 
felt it was, you know, uplifting. The story was

44:39.515 --> 44:40.617
uplifting. Yes, especially when you knew you were 
going to be taken prisoner by somebody in the next

44:40.637 --> 44:44.241
couple of days. Yeah, and they have no idea where 
you're going to end up or what's going to happen to

44:44.262 --> 44:49.268
you. That book has sustained me many, many times. 
And I wish anybody could read it, like in any

44:54.608 --> 44:59.595
foxhole anywhere in the world. which there are 
plenty of right now, this very minute, somebody's

45:00.031 --> 45:04.637
been shot at. And you need an uplifting story. How 
can I get out of this? I'm going to find a woman that

45:09.582 --> 45:18.593
will put up with me after all this, you know, that 
type of thing. So that was just a novel.

45:24.100 --> 45:27.063
You had mentioned a movie or a TV movie that was 
similar to that. A TV movie? I remember a movie that

45:28.972 --> 45:31.135
called Summer of My German Soldier. It was a TV 
movie, perhaps five or ten years ago. And you was

45:35.701 --> 45:37.062
there? Summer of My German Soldier, in 
Mississippi someplace, or Alabama, a German,

45:37.883 --> 45:49.919
local German prison camp, and he escapes and falls 
in love with a Jewish girl in the town. Yes, yes.

45:54.445 --> 45:54.665
Really? Oh, a Jewish girl? This fellow, they gave 
me my first job. Herb Lipkin was Jewish. Great big

46:01.563 --> 46:02.886
guy. About my size, but not bigger. Taught me 
everything about business. And he and I would go

46:09.356 --> 46:11.038
skiing together. Thanksgiving roll around, he'd 
lock up and say, let's go to Aspen. Oh, that's nice.

46:16.126 --> 46:18.851
It's over a thousand miles in his great big Buick. 
We'd go to Aspen and ski and Utah, Alta, Alta. Alta?

46:25.133 --> 46:27.923
Alta, A-L-T-A, Utah. But when was this?
