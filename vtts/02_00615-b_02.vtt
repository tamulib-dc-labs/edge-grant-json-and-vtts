WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:30.831
The whole

00:01.280 --> 00:30.831
approach to oceanography, once the needs to 
describe the ocean and to find where to go to see

00:01.280 --> 00:30.831
what was happening, has caused the oceanographic 
programs and the intergovernmental and

00:01.280 --> 00:30.831
international sense to take on a whole new aspect. 
And we're beginning to look at the oceans now more

00:32.920 --> 00:38.848
and more as what the hell has man done to the oceans? 
And so we have organizations like GESAMP,

00:40.550 --> 00:53.267
G-E-S-A-M-P, which is a multiple nation group 
looking at other pollutants in the ocean. The

00:54.228 --> 01:01.257
GIPME, which is the Global Investigations of 
Marine Pollution, So we're beginning to

01:02.688 --> 01:23.567
recognize that the oceans as some place to 
distribute our waste are not the, what, well,

01:02.688 --> 01:23.567
their capacity to absorb is finite. We used to 
think, hell, the ocean is so big and the dilution

01:24.227 --> 01:30.653
factor is so great and they're so deep. Let's not 
worry. Well, we begin to realize that isn't the

01:32.480 --> 01:38.291
case anymore. I have some questions to ask about 
pollution, and I have a couple of other questions

01:38.351 --> 01:44.323
to ask first, too, and I think I'll probably do them 
in this order. A

01:45.004 --> 01:52.759
hypothetical question, since you've always been 
involved in... international cooperation. It

01:54.683 --> 02:01.251
seems to the outsider that international 
cooperation will soon be essentially a thing of

01:54.683 --> 02:01.251
the past. That 200-mile limits, underdeveloped 
nations being concerned about exploitations of

02:02.212 --> 02:12.184
their resources that you can't separate economic 
and physical oceanography.

02:15.268 --> 02:18.612
These kinds of problems will increase tensions 
between between nations involved in

02:18.912 --> 02:23.738
oceanography and be pushed back into our own 
coastal shores. Would you comment on that rather

02:23.758 --> 02:26.181
long question? I'd be less than truthful if I 
didn't indicate that there are other political

02:26.462 --> 02:33.451
overtones. We first became, or I first became 
aware of these as a result of activities of what was

02:34.592 --> 02:43.003
called the Group of 77. This was a group of 77 
developing nations, the nations of the third

02:45.288 --> 03:12.258
world, who wanted the Intergovernmental 
Oceanographic Commission

02:45.288 --> 03:12.258
to look at their problems in terms of training, 
education, mutual assistance, to help them bring

02:45.288 --> 03:12.258
their technology up to other levels of the 
developed country. They weren't about to listen

03:16.523 --> 03:23.025
to problems relating to increasing pollution in 
the ocean. They said, look, you guys brought your

03:24.009 --> 03:29.267
technology up to a level that you have a high 
standard of living and by so doing you've had an

03:30.445 --> 03:37.853
impact on the ocean, albeit inadvertent. Now you 
don't want us to become technologically advanced

03:38.674 --> 03:49.886
because we would increase the level of the impact 
on the ocean and the atmosphere. So that became one

03:51.268 --> 03:59.136
of the underlying problems in the 
intergovernmental and international

03:59.504 --> 04:02.088
cooperation, and I think is still there. It's not 
just in oceanography, it's in housing, it's in

04:03.891 --> 04:14.169
health, it's in a number of the areas of the United 
Nations technical families. What about in this

04:14.389 --> 04:15.391
country? Certainly here, in terms of group 
tensions. You know, how do you purify the

04:19.518 --> 04:24.246
environment if in cleaning up the environment you 
leave the minorities out? I don't know that that is

04:26.453 --> 04:33.380
so much of a national problem.

04:33.400 --> 04:38.985
I feel that maybe it was more in the past than it is 
now. But I think the problems of the nation are such

04:39.105 --> 04:53.980
that all the groups are beginning to work together 
and say, what can we do to clean it up a bit? But you

04:54.888 --> 05:02.155
suggested in terms of international cooperation 
that sometimes in the distant, and by distant I

04:54.888 --> 05:02.155
mean far distant future. In terms of? In terms of 
cooperation in oceanography towards. Well, I

05:07.220 --> 05:19.131
think the cooperation is still there, but I think 
that

05:07.220 --> 05:19.131
cooperation now requires one to pay a price. There 
was a time when I used to go to sea when I used to be

05:24.807 --> 05:48.085
responsible for ships going to sea, that the State 
Department would get you the clearance to work

05:24.807 --> 05:48.085
around the Marquesas Islands, Tumultu, Society 
Islands in the Pacific, coast of Brazil, coast

05:24.807 --> 05:48.085
of West Africa. And if you didn't get the approval, 
you simply went did your oceanographic research.

05:56.507 --> 05:58.389
Nobody ever really said anything. If you knew the 
people, as we most often did, we would have their

06:00.191 --> 06:05.757
scientists on board. Then the research began to 
get a little more sophisticated in terms of

06:07.279 --> 06:19.873
looking for oil and gas resources or doing 
geophysical research, let me put it that way. the

06:21.085 --> 06:46.375
type of research that one can make 
interpretations on the presence or absence of oil

06:21.085 --> 06:46.375
and gas research, we began to become more 
sophisticated in the studies of the life history,

06:21.085 --> 06:46.375
of the distribution, the availability of the 
living resources, shrimp, the tunas, the other

06:21.085 --> 06:46.375
fishes. And the developing nations began to 
realize that because they didn't have the ships

06:51.275 --> 07:00.606
and sophisticated research capabilities that 
they damn well may be losing out. So they said, OK,

07:01.948 --> 07:10.519
if you want to do research in our area, then you seek 
permission from our government. And I can

07:10.899 --> 07:19.830
remember receiving from both Mexico and Brazil 
beautifully signed agreements or the Geronimo

07:20.165 --> 07:33.863
and the Undaunted out of our lab in Miami, we would 
carry one naval officer and two scientists on our

07:20.165 --> 07:33.863
ships the whole time we were in their territorial 
waters. And we would agree to provide copies of all

07:35.445 --> 07:43.155
data and aliquot portions of all samples to their 
scientists. Their territorial waters now are 200

07:44.457 --> 07:46.539
miles. That's right. In those days, it was 3 miles 
and 12 miles. It was kind of vague when you're doing

07:52.038 --> 08:02.010
research in the Caribbean or off of the Gulf of 
Mexico. And it worked out. We said, sure, we'd love

08:04.113 --> 08:06.116
to have you on board. I don't recall a time that it 
didn't work out to our mutual advantage. We were

08:16.898 --> 08:20.603
more concerned about the oceans, the tunas. They 
didn't catch the tunas. Our nation did, the

08:22.365 --> 08:27.651
Japanese did, but the Brazilians didn't catch the 
tunas. The people from Colombia and Mexico, they

08:27.831 --> 08:35.060
were interested in the shrimp, the conch, 
sardines.

08:38.484 --> 08:41.368
But not with the law of the sea convention. And ever 
since our friend from Malta proposed that the

08:46.497 --> 08:56.948
non-living resources on and under the seabed were 
the property of all men, all nations. And any

08:58.290 --> 09:14.547
monetary

08:58.290 --> 09:14.547
return from exploitation of these resources 
should go into an international pot for

08:58.290 --> 09:14.547
distribution among the third world. We've been 
having more of the political overtones. You've

09:20.175 --> 09:29.048
got to remember the proportion of the developing 
nations in the UN compared to the so-called

09:20.175 --> 09:29.048
developed nations. There's about 161 developing 
nations who have equal vote to the United States or

09:30.390 --> 09:44.230
Canada or the USSR or France or Japan or any of the 
more developed nations. But you also can have

09:46.420 --> 09:51.167
problems between developed nations and 
developed nations. There's been almost a war

09:51.267 --> 09:55.213
between Iceland and Great Britain over the 
control of fishing. What is that going to do to

09:55.754 --> 09:57.897
international cooperation? Oh, in the long run, I 
can't answer that. Certainly it does throw a

10:02.424 --> 10:07.652
glitch into it, as NASA would say. After all, we 
have... our problems with Canada. Where is the

10:12.006 --> 10:17.172
boundary between the United States and Canada out 
200 miles? That's not really been settled. Whose

10:20.015 --> 10:25.202
fish are we fishing when we catch the salmon? Are 
the Japanese, when they catch the salmon west of

10:25.222 --> 10:37.516
the 180th meridian, catching Bristol Bay salmon, 
are those our fish or their fish? After the war, the

10:39.138 --> 10:45.349
policy of abstention held, and they could not fish 
east of 172 degrees east. Well, we had just won a

10:46.210 --> 10:51.279
war, so we said, thou shalt not, and they didn't. 
They became stronger and stronger, and they did

10:52.160 --> 11:04.521
more and more research, and I can remember to this 
day the meeting that was held, and they said, show

10:52.160 --> 11:04.521
us that the fish we are catching East of 172 degrees 
east are yours. Show us for good, sound research.

11:13.104 --> 11:13.825
And we couldn't do it. So they said, then no longer 
will we accept the policy of abstention.

11:28.845 --> 11:33.732
The 200-mile fisheries extended zone So far, 
March the 1st to March the 18th, it seems to be

11:34.032 --> 11:42.365
working reasonably well. The other vessels are 
here. They have permits. They have quotas.

11:48.274 --> 11:59.972
Insofar as I know, we have had only one incident 
with one vessel, one nation in this time out of the

11:48.274 --> 11:59.972
several hundreds that are here. What this abodes 
for the future, I don't know. Our own fishermen

12:06.325 --> 12:08.128
aren't very happy about it. But I think they've got 
to accept the fact that fishery resources have

12:10.311 --> 12:18.724
some kind of a maximum sustained yield. And if 
we're a long way under that, then the policy is that

12:18.784 --> 12:28.879
the other nations with quotas may fish.

12:40.823 --> 12:41.784
Okay. Now, I want to drop back more to some 
chronological questions right now. Okay. The

12:48.374 --> 13:04.418
last time we were talking, you had arrived at, or 
sort of obliquely had arrived at, back into this

12:48.374 --> 13:04.418
country, if I may mean the continental part of the 
country, where you become involved with... the

13:04.853 --> 13:13.903
biological laboratory first in D.C., then in 
Miami, and then back in D.C. And you said that the

13:04.853 --> 13:13.903
same ideas that appeared for 10 years, it was sort 
of time for you to come back. What new ideas did you

13:13.983 --> 13:22.852
bring back now to the laboratory work in Miami and 
in Washington? I don't know if there were so much

13:22.872 --> 13:30.861
new ideas as they were the application to the 
tropical Atlantic of what I learned concerning

13:32.056 --> 13:45.476
the biology, distribution, abundance, the other 
words concerning the tunas, because there was a

13:32.056 --> 13:45.476
tuna fishery developing in the Atlantic. They 
were mostly

13:45.816 --> 13:59.937
the vessels from Japan, Yugoslavia, Spain, and 
our west coast tuna vessels did not have anything

14:00.288 --> 14:04.154
to do in the off season. And you don't make any money 
tied up at the dock. So we proposed to develop a tuna

14:08.782 --> 14:15.472
fishery in the Gulf of Guinea.

14:18.878 --> 14:26.430
And it would be developed with the idea that the 
West Coast clippers could come over there in the

14:18.878 --> 14:26.430
off season. So the first season they came over, as a 
result of the work of our lab in Miami, they caught

14:27.406 --> 14:38.158
24,000 tons of tuna. So we achieved at least one of 
the goals that the lab in Miami set out to do. Mr.

14:45.366 --> 14:56.198
McKernan made a commitment to the Organization of 
African Unity, the OAU, that the beer commercial

14:45.366 --> 14:56.198
fisheries of Department of Interior at that time, 
the United States, would undertake a major

14:56.414 --> 15:20.188
research effort in the tropical Atlantic and that 
to house the people and the ships and all of this

14:56.414 --> 15:20.188
that he would give up a major lab in Miami or in the 
southeast and that was the job I was asked to

14:56.414 --> 15:20.188
undertake. So we converted a building here in the 
Navy Yard, brought together the staff, got the two

15:24.427 --> 15:50.772
big ex-Navy sea-going tugs, the Geronimo and the 
Undaunted, got the appropriation bill through to

15:24.427 --> 15:50.772
build a lab in Miami, hired the architect, built 
the building, moved to Miami,

15:53.300 --> 15:57.225
The week we hit there, Hurricane Betsy hit at the 
same time. So it was an auspicious beginning.

16:03.252 --> 16:14.765
And

16:03.252 --> 16:14.765
we brought some people there from Hawaii who had 
had experience, both on the ship and in terms of the

16:03.252 --> 16:14.765
fishermen. We brought some of the Hawaiian and 
Japanese fishermen over with us. So as to bringing

16:21.734 --> 16:32.231
anything new, we brought essentially tried and 
proven techniques into the ocean of the areas of

16:21.734 --> 16:32.231
the world.

16:35.696 --> 16:36.097
It was fun. And after you've succeeded reasonably 
well at this goal, then you come back to

16:36.778 --> 16:42.547
Washington? Is there any reason why? Yeah. Two 
reasons. First I got a call, would I consider

16:49.595 --> 16:58.748
coming to Washington to take over as the director 
of the National Oceanographic Data Center? I

16:58.768 --> 17:09.343
said, no way, living here on Virginia, Key 
Biscayne, beautiful new big home, three minutes

16:58.768 --> 17:09.343
from the office, through a lovely park along the 
beach. The more I got to thinking about it, we had

17:10.665 --> 17:18.977
our new lab, we had a superb staff, two big ships, 
good ongoing program. And I guess a little of the

17:20.645 --> 17:22.427
fun had gone. The challenge was gone. And so I 
called and said, OK. So I was asked to come up for an

17:31.275 --> 17:33.217
interview. And I took on the job of

17:33.277 --> 17:43.507
director of the National Oceanographic Data 
Center. And I stayed there until NOAA was formed,

17:43.588 --> 17:49.133
when Dr. White asked me if I would come on as other 
director of EDS. The exception of Hawaii, I've

17:54.478 --> 17:59.586
never stayed in a job much longer than five years. 
This job, I've been here now six years. I still

18:06.657 --> 18:13.588
enjoy getting up every day, but some of the 
challenge is gone. It's a good organization.

18:16.272 --> 18:18.495
They're superb people. There must be some more 
problems someplace else. Had you always been

18:24.722 --> 18:27.204
interested in the environment and pollution? Is 
that the way you explain moving in here? You're

18:28.846 --> 18:31.989
not, okay. The job I'm in now, of course, relates to 
environmental data and information,

18:32.009 --> 18:41.218
description of the environment.

18:43.200 --> 18:48.786
Oh, I had to learn an awful lot in a hurry because as 
an oceanographer I didn't know very much about the

18:49.643 --> 18:54.591
bloom blowers and the meteorology. The 
meteorologists are the bloom blowers and the

18:54.611 --> 18:59.459
oceanographers the bottle dunkers. But it's 
become really exciting because we have developed

19:01.302 --> 19:09.355
very large databases and information bases. And 
Dr. White about three years ago said, now I want you

19:11.398 --> 19:16.967
to begin using them. We formed a center for 
climatic and environmental assessment, for

19:17.926 --> 19:24.436
instance. And they're concerned with developing 
models for yield of wheat, corn, soybeans. That's

19:36.054 --> 19:41.422
in our center in Columbia, Missouri. And then next 
door is the assessment Division and their

19:44.133 --> 20:12.823
responsibility every day is to look at the 
satellite imagery and the weather patterns and

19:44.133 --> 20:12.823
the development of the droughts and or the floods 
and or snowpack and look at the implications and

19:44.133 --> 20:12.823
probabilities that we will for instance if you 
look right now in our west at the soil moisture

20:13.428 --> 20:19.796
you'll find that in many places it's 40% of the 
normal. Now, what is the probability of bringing

20:19.836 --> 20:30.609
it up as a result of rainfall between now and 
germination of the wheat? Probability is all the

20:30.869 --> 20:33.332
way down there. The odds are we're not going to get 
it. Now, when you think of the lowest snowpack in

20:36.576 --> 20:41.983
history, the Rockies, What's that going to do to 
the irrigation? What's that going to do to

20:44.848 --> 20:48.291
hydroelectric power? It's a little frightening, 
actually. We spent a good bit of time working on gas

20:52.495 --> 21:05.008
utilization of the natural gas as a function of 
degree days. 65 degrees is generally the

21:05.028 --> 21:11.515
temperature above which you begin to think about 
air conditioning. below which you begin to think

21:12.170 --> 21:14.413
about heating. So 63 degrees would be two degree 
days heating degree. 68 degrees would be three air

21:20.021 --> 21:23.326
conditioning days. So you can use degree days as a 
measure of the climate to look at gas consumption,

21:24.548 --> 21:37.567
oil consumption, corn yields, and so forth. So we 
now have... Models for the United States, Canada,

21:40.317 --> 21:51.348
Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, People's 
Republic of China, USSR. And we, every day, can

21:52.449 --> 22:00.457
make an assessment through various satellites 
and other techniques. Success of germination,

22:01.438 --> 22:07.624
aerial extent of drought, I don't want to

22:08.735 --> 22:24.362
delay you very long, but I do want to have the 
answers to these. This trip in Washington has been

22:26.446 --> 22:29.511
sort of a revelation to me in one way. And almost in 
every case, everybody to whom I've asked this

22:30.166 --> 22:37.056
question has been very enthusiastic about their 
work in Washington. Have you ever been sorry about

22:37.557 --> 22:40.982
having joined the bureaucracy? I always come 
back. As they say, no matter where I've gone, my

22:42.605 --> 22:47.672
wife and I love it here. Has the work with 
government generally been exciting

22:48.894 --> 22:52.079
intellectually for you? Have you ever had any 
conflicts with, let's say, the military in your

22:53.181 --> 22:57.507
early career in terms of What direction your 
research or activities should go? Oh, not that we

23:02.653 --> 23:05.618
haven't easily resolved. No, I have had some. No, 
no, no, I can't say I've had, because there have

23:09.944 --> 23:22.903
been some times that I've argued about, for 
instance, the classification of oceanographic

23:09.944 --> 23:22.903
data, but I must say in all fairness that the amount 
of oceanographic data that the military have

23:23.508 --> 23:29.994
classified is very small. And in almost every case 
such classification has been with good cause

23:30.014 --> 23:36.940
because it's national security. There are times 
that a scientist, and I not really can classify

23:37.841 --> 23:52.975
myself as a scientist in the same framework as a 
monk or I'm

23:53.377 --> 24:00.145
a descriptive oceanographer and an ecologist.

24:02.929 --> 24:13.962
There are times we think, or did think, before I

24:02.929 --> 24:13.962
learned more, that classification was 
ridiculous. Well, it isn't. There are times it's a

24:16.966 --> 24:21.291
necessity, and it's in the best interest of our 
nation to do it. Now, the next series of questions I

24:22.132 --> 24:28.681
want to ask before you leave concerns really 
pollution and the ocean. Your work as an

24:28.941 --> 24:30.303
ecologist. Are you optimistic about pollution 
and the ocean? Well, I'm always optimistic, sure.

24:35.050 --> 24:38.795
And I don't mean that in a naive sense. Our nation 
works on almost a principle of a pendulum. You see,

24:45.364 --> 24:51.632
we overhear and then we begin to... pollute the 
oceans or the atmosphere the streams and the lakes

24:51.832 --> 25:21.670
and our people begin to react they begin to realize 
and then we're over here and they say okay now

24:51.832 --> 25:21.670
that's got to come to a screeching halt so we will 
begin to spend our hard earned money to swing the

24:51.832 --> 25:21.670
pendulum back and it's a very strange but very 
successful type of government that we have there

24:51.832 --> 25:21.670
isn't a A better one in the world, as strange as it 
is. So when people say, for example, the Red Sea or

25:25.721 --> 25:34.897
the Mediterranean Sea are dying... I think it's 
overstated. Yeah, I do. I think it's a degree of

25:42.330 --> 25:45.515
scare tactics that brings results. That's... I 
think you understand what I mean. If you can get

25:48.818 --> 25:52.743
people to react, they're going to overcome 
problems. If you can't get them to react, the

25:52.843 --> 25:57.309
problems will increase in magnitude. Are you 
optimistic about mariculture and aquaculture?

26:03.056 --> 26:03.136
Yes. Feeding the starving millions, or whatever 
that means.

26:08.002 --> 26:11.647
I don't know that one needs to be optimistic or not 
optimistic. If the demand is there, we can do it.

26:15.051 --> 26:16.733
For instance, when I was in Hawaii, I was involved 
in aquaculture with the tilapia. This is an

26:23.957 --> 26:27.222
Asiatic fish that is a mouth breeder. When the 
mother opens the mouth, hundreds of little ones go

26:28.043 --> 26:33.811
in the mouth, and she closes her mouth. And the 
tails are sticking out. They're the cutest damn

26:36.515 --> 26:38.397
things. But you put those in a rice paddy, and they 
will grow up very rapidly. and they will turn an

26:45.704 --> 26:57.399
awful lot of material and the bottom muds and rice 
paddies and ponds into protein to beautiful,

26:45.704 --> 26:57.399
clean, white fish. Just like the carp. I don't mean 
the carp, I mean the catfish. When I worked in

27:05.630 --> 27:09.855
Miami, I worked a lot with a man in St. Pete. who we 
called Catfish because he was trying to convince

27:11.270 --> 27:29.289
the people as a result of the work of Swingle and 
Smith that all of the bayous and the ponds in

27:11.270 --> 27:29.289
Louisiana and Texas and Mississippi, they should 
rear catfish because people couldn't afford the

27:11.270 --> 27:29.289
damn things. They were so expensive, and yet 
they're so easy to grow. They convert material

27:33.233 --> 27:40.180
into protein so readily, so the potential is 
there. But the economics are not. That's why you

27:42.681 --> 27:44.703
raise the pompano. That's why you raise 
northwestern United States of the salmon.

27:52.574 --> 27:56.920
Shirley Temple Black's husband is one of the 
leaders in that area. That's why you raise shrimp.

27:59.624 --> 28:01.086
That's why you raise oysters. Because these have a 
large dollar value where carp and i mean catfish

28:07.261 --> 28:34.956
and tilapia don't so if people get hungry enough if 
the economics adjust that's a problem

28:07.261 --> 28:34.956
i'm not saying we know enough yet to do it you say 
feed the starving people of the world fish protein

28:35.155 --> 28:35.836
concentrate. This is a superb example where we had 
an ideal opportunity. One little plastic package

28:40.283 --> 28:53.983
of fish protein concentrate on a bowl of rice would 
give a person their total daily protein

28:40.283 --> 28:53.983
requirement. Okay, what good is that going to do if 
you bring it in on the dock any place in a West

28:55.084 --> 29:04.318
African country or Java or a bangledash. You've 
got to get it back where the people are. Okay, how do

29:07.972 --> 29:09.113
you get it there? There are no trains. There are no 
roads. There are the rivers, but you can't get up

29:11.576 --> 29:14.780
the rivers. Fish protein concentrate you could 
have dropped from airplanes in these little

29:15.241 --> 29:20.126
packages. How do you convince the people to eat? 
You've got to get somebody in there to educate them

29:23.390 --> 29:34.744
that if they would sprinkle the magical white 
powder on the rice or the... What's the great big

29:35.753 --> 29:43.801
crinulated green ball-like vegetable that grows 
in other tropics? Anyway, it was a beautiful

29:44.401 --> 29:46.724
thing. But our nation would not market it, 
although it was shown without a doubt to be 100%

29:46.744 --> 30:03.240
pure, odorless, because the fish hadn't guts. 
Then we tried to export it. And immediately the

30:06.027 --> 30:17.708
nations who are not quite as friendly with us as we 
would like said, ha-ha, you won't let your own

30:06.027 --> 30:17.708
people eat it, but you'll send it over here to the 
developing countries to get rid of it. So as a

30:18.390 --> 30:29.470
result, the market went shook to distribution, 
education, and politics.
