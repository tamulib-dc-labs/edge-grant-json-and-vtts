WEBVTT

00:01.786 --> 00:03.208
She was here for commencement? Yeah, she was here 
for commencement. She grew up in the next town. She

00:08.735 --> 00:11.398
grew up in the town of Menard. Oh, okay. I saved her 
from a life at the University of Texas. She was a

00:17.806 --> 00:23.714
junior at the University of Texas when we got 
married. We decided that we'd wait and let her

00:23.734 --> 00:29.962
finish up her degree at some other time, which 
she's never done. Mm-hmm. And we lived in what was

00:30.693 --> 00:36.622
known as the new project houses. Yes. $37.50 a 
month. Describe that. Oh, beautiful facilities,

00:40.448 --> 00:43.873
really, compared to what else we had. These were 
the, well, they're torn down now, but there were

00:44.373 --> 00:48.179
tennis courts in there. But they were very nice, a 
two-story apartment, and we were on the second

00:49.040 --> 00:56.672
story. Had a nice living room, kitchen, dining 
room, living room together, and two bedrooms. And

01:06.005 --> 01:09.369
it was $37.50, and that was great. Furnished? 
Yeah, furnished. Oh, my. Yeah. No. But $19.50,

01:14.034 --> 01:19.099
that was very reasonable. And we had no 
automobile. And you were in a small little

01:21.521 --> 01:27.448
community of other young marrieds. Right. Now, 
were these the old project house structures that

01:28.490 --> 01:32.856
had been redone? No, these were new, relatively 
new. The old project houses were really trashy

01:36.922 --> 01:40.367
stuff. They'd been worn out for years. These had 
been there for a while. I think they were built

01:44.593 --> 01:47.136
during the early part of the war. Reckon how many 
couples were over there at one time? How many

01:50.982 --> 01:58.412
could... Let's see, there'd be four couples to the 
building, and there were probably about... I'm

02:00.113 --> 02:03.097
going to say 30 or 40 buildings, so quite a few. 100 
or so couples. What kind of community activities

02:06.100 --> 02:11.927
did you young marrieds have? Very nice. It was 
really good. We had either penny ante poker games

02:13.870 --> 02:28.247
where you carried the pennies in a jar, you know, or 
a bridge or those sort of things and shared dinners

02:13.870 --> 02:28.247
with each other. Picnics. Picnics, go to the 
events, go to the movies. At that time, well, we

02:33.240 --> 02:43.293
were one of the last ones to get an automobile, but 
next door neighbors had an automobile, and we'd go

02:33.240 --> 02:43.293
to the movies. At that time, they had the Midnight 
Surprise movies. That guy in? No, this was down in

02:50.143 --> 02:58.234
downtown Bryant, Palace Theater, whatever it was 
down there. It was always a surprise, but always a

02:58.467 --> 03:02.673
very good movie. But it started at midnight on 
Saturday night, so we'd take those in. Let's see,

03:09.762 --> 03:12.446
picnics there? Did y'all sometimes have an 
outdoor cookout? Oh, yeah, we would. Somebody

03:18.454 --> 03:26.685
would have friends on the coast and get a big bunch 
of shrimp or a big bunch of oysters in and have...

03:27.762 --> 03:29.565
You know, sort of a communal feed. What kind of 
shopping opportunities were there at Southgate

03:30.587 --> 03:35.775
then? There was a small grocery store there at 
Southgate. There was the cleaners.

03:45.471 --> 03:46.272
And the drugstore. And the drugstore. What was 
their name? Maitley. Maitley's Pharmacy. Yeah,

03:52.167 --> 03:53.308
Maitley's Pharmacy. Then Maitley and his wife had 
that dress shop. It was very convenient. If you

04:03.179 --> 04:05.942
didn't have an automobile, it was very 
convenient. You could have everything you really

04:05.962 --> 04:09.746
had right there, close to you. Right, so you finish 
your degree in one year, then what? Then I was...

04:17.442 --> 04:21.007
contacted by a fellow who had called John McNeely. 
They were setting up, this was New York City, they

04:21.027 --> 04:37.009
were setting up a business, or they had the 
business already going, called Industrial

04:21.027 --> 04:37.009
Commodity Corporation, but they were looking for 
someone who had a background in ag research, and

04:21.027 --> 04:37.009
particularly in livestock. And so they came down 
and talked to me, and it sounded like a good

04:37.870 --> 04:47.263
opportunity to do something different. see the 
big city. So we took it for the sum total of $5,000 a

04:49.725 --> 04:55.632
year. Moved to the big city and moved. Rich, our 
older son, was born here. And I took off in a

05:04.442 --> 05:12.591
trailer, pulling a trailer with all of our, what 
little household goods we had, and drove to New

05:04.442 --> 05:12.591
York. And Doc said the baby came up, flew up. Now, 
this is 1951 or 2?

05:20.102 --> 05:21.844
No, this was late 52. 52. And you were up there how 
long? I was up there a little over two years. And

05:29.013 --> 05:36.081
finally decided that we lived in a little town on 
Long Island called Belmore. On the Long Island

05:36.161 --> 05:39.605
Railway. So it was an easy commute in, except it 
took an hour each way. So I caught the 657 every

05:45.800 --> 05:50.065
morning. They get into work at 9 o'clock. I said, it 
took two hours. And they came in about 7 o'clock

05:55.070 --> 05:58.614
that night. I finally realized that I had a little 
baby girl that I had not seen in the daylight since

05:59.535 --> 06:07.643
she was born, except occasionally on the weekend. 
So we left there and moved. They set up a Regional

06:14.234 --> 06:21.481
Livestock Marketing Research Organization in 
Denver, which is sponsored by the 12 western

06:14.234 --> 06:21.481
states. And at that time it was called the 12 
Western States and Texas, but we weren't

06:22.682 --> 06:29.829
officially a western state at that time. But it was 
headquartered

06:29.849 --> 06:40.900
operationally out of Colorado State, but our 
offices were in Denver. So I moved down there and

06:43.360 --> 07:13.300
stayed there until 50 spring of our winter of 56 
moved down here then and what were you going to do we

06:43.360 --> 07:13.300
were setting up the big problem that they were that 
we were trying to address was how to forecast the

06:43.360 --> 07:13.300
market conditions for feeder livestock coming 
off of it coming off of the ranges how to how to

06:43.360 --> 07:13.300
anticipate what the volume are going to be and some 
of the conditions and weights were going to be how

06:43.360 --> 07:13.300
the livestock coming in off of the winter ranges 
and fall ranges and the cattle feeding market. The

07:20.672 --> 07:24.978
reason it was located in Denver because that's 
where most of the cattle feeding was taking place

07:20.672 --> 07:24.978
up in that area. All right, and you come here to do 
what? Came here then to

07:28.403 --> 07:43.303
work with, when I came here, I came down one time to 
see some people in Ag Eco, John McNeely, and he said

07:28.403 --> 07:43.303
they were starting a new program over here called 
the something like the Texas Transportation

07:43.638 --> 08:09.342
Institute and Fred Benson was the honcho of it and 
they were looking for somebody to join up with that

07:43.638 --> 08:09.342
program thought it might be a good opportunity to 
come over and see him so they had to talk to him over

07:43.638 --> 08:09.342
and talk to Fred and he said well they were looking 
for somebody they wanted to look at the customer

08:09.625 --> 08:11.807
needs in transportation. We'd always been 
concerned about the producer of transportation,

08:11.847 --> 08:21.918
the people that were doing the actual physical 
work of moving people and goods and so forth. And we

08:21.938 --> 08:29.165
really had not paid that much attention to what the 
people who were using the transportation really

08:21.938 --> 08:29.165
wanted. So we said, we've got Mr. Thomas H. 
McDonald, who was chief of the old Bureau of Public

08:29.185 --> 08:37.894
Roads for many, many years, 34 years, I think. And 
he's going to be sort of, he and Gib Gilchrist are

08:38.768 --> 08:50.501
the ones that sort of put this together, and 
they're looking for somebody to sort of take this

08:38.768 --> 08:50.501
program over and run with it. That's Mr. 
McDonnell, by the way. Did you ever know him,

08:52.623 --> 08:53.745
Louie? He was a very nice guy, very sharp. I don't 
believe so. So Fred said, now, I'm going to be

09:05.363 --> 09:07.807
working over there, but I didn't have a decision. 
It's going to be on whether Mr. MacDonald and Mr.

09:07.967 --> 09:15.738
Gilchrist would, uh, they'll be the ones making 
the decision whether to hire you. So I went over and

09:17.180 --> 09:21.606
visited with them and, uh, went back to Denver and 
got a call. Yeah, they'd like to have me and that

09:21.626 --> 09:27.194
Fred Benson would want to deal with. And so Fred, 
uh, had then wrote me a letter and said that, uh,

09:34.034 --> 09:40.624
They had agreed that the position was open and that 
they'd like to have me and that they were willing to

09:34.034 --> 09:40.624
pay $7,000 a year. I said, Fred, Mr. Benson. We 
didn't call him Fred then. Mr. Benson, I just left a

09:47.074 --> 09:55.867
job in New York that was paying me $12,500 and moved 
to Denver to take one for $10,000. Now I'm going to

09:55.967 --> 09:59.553
move back down here to take one for $7,000. At least 
get it up to $7,200. It's even a little better. He

10:03.937 --> 10:08.422
said, I hate to tell you this, but that's all the 
money I've got. And said, not only that, we've

10:08.442 --> 10:13.768
already turned in the budgets for next year. And so 
you won't get a raise next year either. So I said,

10:18.392 --> 10:24.940
OK. We were anxious to start to get back here. And so 
we took the job again. And

10:29.131 --> 10:37.600
what was the name of the organization at that time? 
Well, it started out, it was really the

10:38.741 --> 10:55.739
organization was created in 1950, and the 
original document had it as the Texas Institute of

10:38.741 --> 10:55.739
Transportation, until they looked at... The 
acronym. The acronym. And so I was still somewhere

10:57.987 --> 11:07.342
where we had the old original document where it's 
all been redlined on and that's been changed over

10:57.987 --> 11:07.342
to the Texas Transportation Institute. And it 
reported to, organizationally, to the office of

11:07.362 --> 11:12.349
whom? Reported to Fred, well, Fred Benson was the, 
at that time it was called the executive director,

11:13.471 --> 11:24.528
not director, no, executive officer. In 
engineering. Oh, and then, all right. Fred was,

11:28.373 --> 11:37.806
when we first came here, Fred was a professor of 
civil engineering, and he had responsibility for

11:28.373 --> 11:37.806
some of the operations of TTI. All right, but your, 
so your appointed title then was director of TTI?

11:44.296 --> 11:48.582
No, I was an associate research economist. Oh, 
okay, and was he the director of? Well, he was the

11:51.706 --> 11:53.829
executive officer. We didn't have a director at 
that time. Just make believe that I didn't know

11:56.999 --> 12:00.344
Fred Benson. Describe him in personality and 
appearance and habit and so forth. As you probably

12:07.515 --> 12:12.904
know, Fred was a Navy captain.

12:12.964 --> 12:13.885
Navy captain? Mm-hmm. No, I did not. Oh, yes. And he 
was always, of course, he always looked like a

12:17.651 --> 12:25.083
movie star. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. a very personable 
fellow, not an effusive type. He was as straight a

12:37.584 --> 12:42.029
shooter as I ever met in my life.

12:43.470 --> 12:48.615
Anything he told you he would do, as far as I know, he 
never backed down on it. He always came through

12:48.635 --> 12:55.542
anything he told you that he would try to do, even 
then he would try to do it. But he said, now, you're

12:56.095 --> 13:07.928
going to be working on, he said, I want Mr. McDonald 
to sort of be with you on all this, because he's been

12:56.095 --> 13:07.928
involved in all this, and it's been of particular 
interest of his. So we worked, I think, until late

13:08.649 --> 13:13.654
57 when Mr. McDonald died. And of course, by that 
time, Mr. Gilchrist was getting pretty feeble. He

13:19.601 --> 13:21.984
was housebound most of the time. So I took most of my 
work over. to his house and worked with him over

13:24.445 --> 13:27.889
there. Now what was his official... He really 
didn't have an official title. He was former

13:32.734 --> 13:49.172
chancellor, but he... TTI was really put together 
by Mr. McDonnell, Fred Benson who was here, Mr.

13:32.734 --> 13:49.172
Gilchrist who was chancellor, and Mr. DeWitt 
Greer who was head of the highway department. The

13:49.192 --> 13:53.997
three of those really conceived the idea of having 
a research institute that could really help move

13:54.517 --> 13:57.261
transportation forward. All three of them had a 
long-standing interest in transportation. Now,

14:01.366 --> 14:04.631
Benson was out of mechanical engineering? Civil. 
But public transportation was and all was one of

14:06.954 --> 14:21.874
his... Highway transportation, particularly he 
was in the physical side, in materials and

14:06.954 --> 14:21.874
construction, that sort of side of 
transportation. Now, it wasn't long until Fred

14:22.428 --> 14:49.245
was moved up to head, when Cy Sandestead retired, 
Fred was moved up to head the Civil Engineering

14:22.428 --> 14:49.245
Department, and was, at that same time, was also 
made director of TTI, a position that he held until

14:22.428 --> 14:49.245
about 62, when Jack Keese then was named, Fred 
moved up to Dean, and Jack Keese was made director.

14:55.836 --> 14:58.058
Where was TTI physically located? Right up here on 
the absolute corner of Spence and Ross. It was a

15:04.344 --> 15:09.709
little small two-story building called the 
Highway Research Center. When we moved into it, or

15:10.990 --> 15:15.054
when I got here, I think there were four of us. So it 
was a building that was plenty big for four people.

15:20.022 --> 15:24.927
And it was primarily a research organization. We 
had two research projects underway, both of which

15:24.947 --> 15:30.873
we got finished successfully. What were they? The 
customer requirements in transportation, which

15:32.835 --> 15:49.371
is the one that I had, and then there was one on the 
effects of highway transportation on land values

15:32.835 --> 15:49.371
that a fellow named Bill Atkins, who is dead now, 
directed. Who were in those early days, who were

15:49.925 --> 15:57.593
the key people in Austin that were supportive of 
TTI? DeWitt Greer was the number one supporter.

16:00.276 --> 16:18.295
He's the one that, and he supported us over

16:00.276 --> 16:18.295
a substantial amount of resistance from some of 
his second level people that really didn't see the

16:00.276 --> 16:18.295
need for research. and in any in any manner in fact 
one of them that we were told who that Mr. Greer said

16:18.680 --> 16:44.788
that when we had a research project that he wanted 
done he said now you take it down and work with

16:18.680 --> 16:44.788
so-and-so down here in this department and he'll 
be the one that you work with so we went down and

16:18.680 --> 16:44.788
talked to him and he said I'll tell you what boy 
this, be sure you print that on some soft paper and

16:47.030 --> 16:54.159
bring it over to me that way so I'll have some real 
use for it. Not real encouraging, not real

16:55.802 --> 17:07.377
encouraging, but we did have the support of the 
administration and that always helps a lot who can

16:55.802 --> 17:07.377
use it correctly. Were there any other states that 
had anything that could serve as a model for TTI?

17:14.266 --> 17:15.788
Not really. There have been, since then, a number 
of states that have come in. We have been used as a

17:21.593 --> 17:24.997
model for a bunch of states. Pennsylvania's

17:25.277 --> 17:31.183
used us almost exclusively as a model. Virginia 
has been doing it for many, many years. They've got

17:34.607 --> 17:45.218
a little different, most of them have a little 
different twist to a lot of things, but we were sort

17:34.607 --> 17:45.218
of the first one, and I guess the first one that was 
set up as a part of a university system.

17:45.569 --> 17:48.393
specifically to do research in transportation. 
And in the 50s and 60s, what were some of the major

17:49.434 --> 18:04.253
projects that y'all did that really helped to move 
it up in importance and credibility?

18:07.697 --> 18:13.585
During that period, we had the Highway Revenue Act 
of 19... 58, I believe it was, which for the first

18:14.155 --> 18:22.646
time made federal funds available to the states to 
do work. This was an old interstate system that was

18:22.826 --> 18:26.831
created back in the old Eisenhower program. And so 
one of the big things we're doing is when you quit

18:27.552 --> 18:42.711
doing what you're doing now, that is dealing with 
local roads or regional roads, just going from

18:27.552 --> 18:42.711
this city to that one, and it's kind of this 
cross-country uh super highway system uh to begin

18:43.062 --> 19:10.521
to look at what effect is this going to have on those 
cities that you're either going through on the

18:43.062 --> 19:10.521
bigger cities or that you're bypassing those 
small ones that you just go by and leave them

18:43.062 --> 19:10.521
sitting out on the limb so some of the earliest work 
that we did was in the effects of these bypasses on

18:43.062 --> 19:10.521
smaller cities from cities the size of Merkel out 
by Abilene down to Baytown and some of those like

19:11.277 --> 19:24.720
that and to look at what does 410 do to the whole land 
value economic activity in San Antonio. So we did

19:24.740 --> 19:28.706
studies on a large number of those. Also we began to 
look at for the first time to look at the fact we've

19:30.189 --> 19:35.698
been doing how we work for all these years, and 
we've been using the same materials and using them

19:36.320 --> 19:41.286
the same way. We've been cookbooking everything. 
We do it because you put so much of this and so much of

19:44.229 --> 19:53.300
that, and this is the way it's done, and practical 
experience shows that may be working out pretty

19:44.229 --> 19:53.300
well, but we find out that really it isn't. So we 
don't really have much, and we're still working on

19:53.320 --> 20:03.171
that problem, by the way, but we've really not 
improved our whole materials application

19:53.320 --> 20:03.171
systems like we should. So we started working in 
that using some things like looking at new

20:04.248 --> 20:13.461
plasticers and additives that you could put in 
asphalt. People sort of assumed that asphalt was a

20:14.683 --> 20:19.629
common material. That is, it was all the same. 
That's asphalt. Asphalt's asphalt and they're

20:23.034 --> 20:24.837
all just alike. Absolutely wrong. Asphalt is what 
you get out of a barrel of crude that's left in the

20:31.265 --> 20:35.890
bottom after you've taken everything you want out 
of the rest of it. So it's going to be a combination

20:35.910 --> 20:41.897
of a hundred different things in different 
quantities. So we're still trying to

20:42.938 --> 20:58.977
characterize and get ways that you can physically 
identify those differences and find out

20:42.938 --> 20:58.977
physically then which ones of these chemical 
compositions work and which ones don't. As you can

21:00.155 --> 21:06.365
see, it becomes a very, very big problem that we've 
been working on for many years. All right, so Fred

21:06.385 --> 21:09.691
Benson as dean, he was supportive. Right. And as 
the years went on, now four decades, did TTI remain

21:12.195 --> 21:23.293
closest to engineering?

21:26.092 --> 21:36.530
And

21:26.092 --> 21:36.530
were there any other institutions that ever tried 
to combat TTI to undo it? Not really. Not any that I

21:40.156 --> 21:44.965
know of that overtly tried to do it. Internally, at 
that time, I know Dean Benson

21:54.273 --> 22:05.129
And I really don't know the background of why this 
is so, but Dean Benson felt that he probably was not

21:54.273 --> 22:05.129
getting the support that he would like to have from 
Dr. Harrington. Now, whether this was because of a

22:06.311 --> 22:15.505
Gilchrist-Harrington problem or what,

22:06.311 --> 22:15.505
but... post-retirement era sort of devoted to 
transportation and TTI. But as far as, we had good

22:22.849 --> 22:29.138
support from the administration of the highway 
department at that time. And so that helped

22:29.198 --> 22:30.780
tremendously. That gave us a base support in 
research, which is the essential element that

22:30.800 --> 22:44.918
anybody going into a structured research program 
like we're in now, where you have that many people

22:30.800 --> 22:44.918
involved, You have to have some sort of a base you 
can count on from year to year. Now, you're going to

22:48.661 --> 22:56.190
bring in outside, other outside money, but you 
have to have that base to really keep it going from

22:48.661 --> 22:56.190
year to year.

23:00.875 --> 23:11.007
Fred was soon, not too long, in 1975, no,

23:12.117 --> 23:12.678
1961. I'm trying to get my people and dates 
together. He was made dean. Jack Keese was made

23:20.395 --> 23:26.427
director at that time, but Fred still, we still 
reported to Fred. Now As you probably, and I hope

23:27.794 --> 23:36.262
you recall, we've gone through all of the 
different variations of how you administered the

23:27.794 --> 23:36.262
system and the A&M University. And later, that's 
one of the things I want you to comment about, which

23:36.282 --> 23:40.365
you think is better. All right, but as he becomes 
dean, then you'll have another supporter in the

23:41.246 --> 23:49.373
key location. How did you introduce the TTI to Earl 
Rutter? Well, this... Earl Rutter was, I had known

23:57.983 --> 24:05.836
Earl Rutter for years and years, so that helped 
some. Well, not necessarily helped, but it did

24:06.517 --> 24:09.462
give an entree. And he was very supportive. We've 
always sort of taken the practical approach to the

24:13.509 --> 24:23.907
research, that it's not highly theoretical, that 
it's going to be put on a bookshelf and left alone,

24:13.509 --> 24:23.907
but it's going to be useful to somebody. And he 
recognized that, and he became active. He

24:30.801 --> 24:36.690
addressed every one of our short courses that we 
had and became very active in the things that we

24:30.801 --> 24:36.690
were doing. Got some real lessons in writing 
speeches for

24:38.633 --> 24:45.003
President Rutter. It was very interesting. He is 
the most effective man I ever saw, indeed, in

24:49.610 --> 24:53.235
short. one-on-one type groups and with smart, 
sharp groups, but public speaking was not his

24:54.160 --> 25:01.747
forte. Did he give you all any advice in what kinds 
of speeches he wanted written? Yeah, he did. Can

25:07.852 --> 25:08.633
you share that? He said that, one, you don't put 
those big, long, complicated words in there that

25:09.434 --> 25:15.519
are hard to pronounce. He wants it in short bites, I 
mean, not bites at that time, but short sentences

25:15.940 --> 25:21.805
where you can get the point across without having 
to go into a great deal of elaboration, and don't be

25:22.223 --> 25:26.868
long-winded. Keep the paragraphs down to a short 
thing. Just a good... See, he had... I really don't

25:34.377 --> 25:48.332
remember what dates this was, but he had taken a 
course in speaking under Dr. Hurd and sent out a

25:34.377 --> 25:48.332
memo to all of the... system parts and university 
administrators that he thought this was such a

25:48.920 --> 25:59.676
good idea that he would encourage everybody else 
to do that. So I did that too. I took that course

26:01.399 --> 26:10.032
under Dr. Harrison Hurt and still consider him to 
be a real good friend. He's a very, very fine

26:10.413 --> 26:12.155
fellow. You said that you knew Mr. Rutter before he 
became president. Describe that acquaintance.

26:16.730 --> 26:25.743
Well, I mentioned before that he grew up in the Eden 
area, which is close to where my family was. We were

26:25.783 --> 26:26.625
in Junction. And my two sisters and his, actually 
went to school at the same time he did in Eden, and

26:26.745 --> 26:38.142
then knew his wife, Margaret, very well. They were 
sort of peer group. And then my brother ran his

26:42.208 --> 26:45.252
ranch for her. a good number of years, immediately 
after World War II. So while we were not old-time

26:49.496 --> 26:55.263
big drinking buddies, I had known him and knew who 
he was. He knew who I was. Chick still... Describe

26:59.929 --> 27:00.669
Mrs. Rudder as you all knew her as a young person. 
Well, she was... I didn't really know her that

27:05.035 --> 27:06.236
well. My two older sisters are quite a bit older 
than I am. They, they knew her quite well. She was,

27:12.085 --> 27:26.266
she was a, they lived on the ranch called, she was a 
Williamson and the ranch was a very nice ranch

27:12.085 --> 27:26.266
located between Hext and London and it's still 
there. She and, she has one brother still living,

27:27.448 --> 27:37.463
Rusty, and he has a part of the ranch too, the 
original part of the ranch, but They've been a

27:38.489 --> 27:41.412
solid old ranching family.

27:45.836 --> 27:49.519
She went to school in, say, Menard and then Eden, I 
think. I don't know whether that's when she and

27:49.679 --> 27:55.885
Earl met in that period of time or not. She told me 
that she met him really because her brother had

27:56.466 --> 28:06.555
gone to JTAC at the same time Mr. Rutter did. He 
brought his yearbook home, and she said, when I saw

28:06.805 --> 28:19.313
the picture of that handsome guy, he's six years 
older than she, and she said, we had a few dates when

28:06.805 --> 28:19.313
I was a freshman at the university. But by the time 
I'm a junior, she said, we began to date a lot, and

28:19.698 --> 28:25.349
seniors were serious. He was then the football 
coach, and she got a job teaching as a first year

28:26.390 --> 28:38.533
teacher, and I believe she said the fall of 36. at 
Brady, making $100 a month. He was making $135, and

28:42.760 --> 28:47.124
they got married the next June. She said Earl had 
saved $80, so she said, I got married on $80 in

28:47.305 --> 28:53.051
faith.

28:55.814 --> 29:02.601
She said, I thought that he was the handsomest, 
that picture was the handsomest looking boy I'd

28:55.814 --> 29:02.601
ever seen. All right, so... you had this 
acquaintance with Mr. Rutter and he became also a

29:05.412 --> 29:13.144
strong supporter.

29:14.927 --> 29:22.779
Were there any, did y'all, did anybody ever try to 
throw rocks in the road, pun intended, for TTI here

29:14.927 --> 29:22.779
on campus? I think mostly we were ignored pretty 
well. We didn't really, bother anybody in the

29:31.973 --> 29:37.702
terms that we weren't cutting into anybody else's 
territory. I guess the most friction that we have

29:37.722 --> 29:59.415
had has probably been with our closest ally, and 
that's civil engineering, because we do have so

29:37.722 --> 29:59.415
many joint appointments and differences 
between, always comes up differences between

29:37.722 --> 29:59.415
when the academic budgets go in and then when the 
system part budgets go in. You're operating off of

29:59.632 --> 30:09.243
different funding sources, and you have 
different sets of requirements of what you can and

29:59.632 --> 30:09.243
cannot give in the way of merit increases and that 
sort of thing. So that always presents another

30:09.263 --> 30:12.587
problem. So that is the main type of thing. As far as 
I know, we have not really been

30:16.632 --> 30:29.166
considered either pro or con by other engineering 
departments, primarily outside of that. because

30:29.737 --> 30:32.820
we don't have that strong relationship with them. 
We do have a number of joint employees from other

30:32.840 --> 30:43.750
departments on campus, but it's generally a one or 
two from each department and not a big number. So

30:43.790 --> 30:55.020
it's not a major problem that if we get a research 
project that's going to demand three full-time

30:43.790 --> 30:55.020
employees and we take them out of the department, 
where are they going to get those people to teach

30:43.790 --> 30:55.020
their courses? You know, that sort of problem. And 
it is a problem. Now, was it a line item

30:57.918 --> 31:01.564
appropriation down through the years? We went in, 
we originally went in as a joint budget because of

31:02.565 --> 31:14.985
Dean Benson was operating both TTI and TEAS, as 
well as the College of Engineering. So we

31:15.566 --> 31:23.098
submitted a joint budget to the legislature, 
which was TEAS and TTI.
