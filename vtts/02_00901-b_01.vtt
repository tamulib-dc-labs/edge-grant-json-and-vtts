WEBVTT

00:01.297 --> 00:09.648
This is a Tape 2 interview with Chuy Hinojosa on 
July 29, 1987. We were talking about the sequence

00:11.511 --> 00:20.944
of department heads, which is becoming difficult 
to keep straight. Anyway, Gordon Echols was asked

00:21.505 --> 00:28.975
to become interim department head in the fall of 
1987. 1985.

00:32.588 --> 00:58.320
Gordon continued in that capacity until the 15th 
of December when after he lost his wife he became

00:32.588 --> 00:58.320
incapable of carrying on as department head and 
was relieved by the department faculty decided

00:32.588 --> 00:58.320
that it had to have a more active department head 
who was capable of carrying on the necessary tasks

00:58.672 --> 01:04.619
that come the way of the department. And so Don 
Sweeney, as acting dean, appointed Wolf Roessler

01:05.339 --> 01:21.017
as interim department head, which position he 
maintains today. The original degree, we offer,

01:24.399 --> 01:28.925
of course, a master's of urban planning. And then 
since then, the doctor of environmental design

01:29.826 --> 01:36.154
has been changed into a PhD. We had the doctor of 
environmental design. Then the MSLD, the Master

01:38.837 --> 01:46.046
of Science in Land Development, was instituted 
when? That was in 1985. I believe so. It's one year.

01:51.541 --> 01:54.224
full-year 36 credit hour program. 36 credit hour. 
Right. With one summer lab. Yes, a whole summer

01:59.569 --> 02:01.671
lab. What course is that? Plan 667. That's when 
they apply all they have studied in the fall and

02:07.697 --> 02:17.166
spring, the theory, you know, they apply it in a 
laboratory for the whole summer. Usually dealing

02:17.186 --> 02:20.029
with large-scale land development companies. 
city projects. What do you view as the future for

02:24.324 --> 02:28.749
the department?

02:32.734 --> 02:34.475
Well, that's a hard question to answer.

02:37.539 --> 02:48.270
I think that the department has been answering the 
needs of the field in terms of producing people in

02:37.539 --> 02:48.270
urban planning that are qualified for the field. I 
see more more cities now hiring planners for their

02:50.468 --> 02:56.177
own staffs. As the federal government has cut back 
on a lot of the funding that before would provide

02:57.399 --> 03:07.456
federal assistance to communities for planning, 
I see now communities taking that on themselves.

03:07.556 --> 03:13.626
And the interesting thing is that they're coming 
to that conclusion themselves, where they want to

03:07.556 --> 03:13.626
have planning studies done for their 
communities. And at least when they're able to,

03:14.327 --> 03:17.252
they hire their own planners afterwards. Many of 
our interns who have served in communities for at

03:18.143 --> 03:31.177
least three months, four months, or half a year 
have consistently been hired as permanent staff

03:18.143 --> 03:31.177
people in planning departments. So I see that as a 
healthy trend that I would hope will continue to

03:32.098 --> 03:38.645
generate a demand for planning. There seems to be 
in Texas more of a recognition of the need for

03:39.586 --> 03:45.012
planning, something that we haven't had in the 
state. Contrast, say, to California or Florida,

03:45.650 --> 03:50.355
which have much longer experiences with 
planning. In fact, they have mandated planning.

03:52.718 --> 03:54.179
As well as Oregon. In Oregon, exactly. And I think 
maybe Massachusetts. There are a few states that

03:57.643 --> 04:01.027
have this, but we don't have that in Texas. We have 
been a pioneer in that regard here in the state as a

04:01.067 --> 04:10.257
school in establishing a career in a field that is 
not as well established and as well understood. So

04:10.979 --> 04:22.573
I think as the state grows and they see the need for 
learning what other states have done, there seems

04:10.979 --> 04:22.573
to be an awareness of the need for the field of 
planning to be established. And I think we stand a

04:22.693 --> 04:28.741
good chance of providing that support.

04:31.824 --> 04:38.252
Thank you very much for your time and to have an 
accurate chronology of your various

04:38.755 --> 04:49.730
planning assignments and your continuing 
involvement in planning education. Thank you,

04:50.671 --> 04:53.735
Bob. Yeah, well, one of the things that we forgot to 
discuss earlier, and some of the contributions

04:53.935 --> 05:06.552
that have been made by the Department to the State 
of Texas and the country, and not only in higher

04:53.935 --> 05:06.552
education, but in public education, It's a short 
course that you helped establish in Texas,

05:07.055 --> 05:10.619
remember? The Commissioner's short course. And I 
think you had a hand in that with your experience

05:14.202 --> 05:17.806
from California. And suggesting that something 
like that would be very valuable here, too. And it

05:22.030 --> 05:24.933
was embraced, and people ran with it. And it's been 
now, I don't know how many years now, 14 years or

05:24.973 --> 05:29.738
something it's been offered? Since 1971. 1971, so 
that would make it... 16 years. It wasn't too far

05:37.024 --> 05:39.487
off. And that's been a good effort. It came out of 
this department and so the faculty member taking

05:43.212 --> 05:46.816
that initiative. And I think you have also 
expressed an interest in working with local

05:46.836 --> 05:51.061
public schools. I believe, did you get a grant or 
something to Pilot maybe a little program with one

05:56.110 --> 06:07.442
of the local schools to work with young kids and 
showing them what the field of planning is about

05:56.110 --> 06:07.442
and what it deals with so they can begin to develop 
an understanding. And I think you're right. I

06:08.723 --> 06:19.534
agree that we need to, as a field, communicate more 
with the general public in this area so they

06:08.723 --> 06:19.534
understand that the field can offer them 
something. For example, when I tell people that

06:19.634 --> 06:25.560
I'm a city planner, they say, well, what's that? 
they just are mystified by it. Well, if you think

06:29.221 --> 06:31.104
about it, it's a relatively new field. It really 
became formalized, although it's very old in many

06:31.224 --> 06:35.449
ways, too. It became formalized in 1935, I think it 
was the first course that was offered at Harvard,

06:36.571 --> 06:46.363
and then in Pennsylvania they were immediately 
thereafter in 1936, with the first attempts at

06:36.571 --> 06:46.363
formal curriculums. I think there's a lot of work 
to be done in terms of what professional planners

06:48.125 --> 06:55.615
do to make themselves known to the American 
public. Very much so. I agree with you. In fact, I

06:58.495 --> 07:04.102
made similar suggestions on the board of APA that 
we should communicate more with the general

06:58.495 --> 07:04.102
public and less with ourselves. We do a lot of 
talking amongst ourselves, but not enough with

07:04.723 --> 07:07.066
you. Yes, you're right. I think that's an 
important area that has to be worked on.

07:14.135 --> 07:14.255
Yeah. End of interview. This is August 3rd, 1987. 
This is Bob Cornish. We're in my office, and I'm

07:19.983 --> 07:22.807
interviewing Jim Gardner. Jim, First of all, go 
over your education in planning, where you went to

07:25.463 --> 07:35.976
school, and any comments you want to make about 
that.

07:39.640 --> 07:53.057
Well, I think getting into the planning education 
program was an outgrowth of my being in an

07:39.640 --> 07:53.057
architectural program at USC, University of 
Southern California. and being exposed to a

07:53.746 --> 08:22.403
person who stimulated me, as well as a lot of 
others, Cy Eisner, Simon Eisner, who, as you know,

07:53.746 --> 08:22.403
is the, along with Gallion, who happened to be the 
dean at the time of the school of architecture,

07:53.746 --> 08:22.403
wrote The Urban Pattern, and took one class from 
him, one of those overview classes that all

08:23.125 --> 08:26.069
architects were supposed to take. And it got me 
thinking about going into graduate school. And I

08:31.736 --> 08:37.224
checked on them, Cal, USC, Berkeley.

08:41.329 --> 08:44.113
I looked into some of the other programs, 
including MIT. And

08:45.294 --> 08:49.399
I qualified. I don't know why.

08:53.399 --> 08:57.104
the normal MIT type would be, I don't think. But the 
program was pretty

08:57.124 --> 09:19.097
non-technically oriented, due to the nature of 
the main faculty, Adams, Howard, and Greeley, who

08:57.124 --> 09:19.097
were a firm, incidentally, as you know, a 
consulting firm, and had quite a wide practice in

08:57.124 --> 09:19.097
the wing. That was Jack Howard? Yeah.

09:23.707 --> 09:24.609
What year was that? 1952,

09:24.789 --> 09:35.854
I

09:24.789 --> 09:35.854
believe. Yellow pipe. I could look it up, but I 
don't know. All right. Whatever. And spent two

09:44.665 --> 09:52.096
years in graduate school, which was a good 
experience for me, you know, personally. Just

09:52.216 --> 09:53.998
being in New England with my wife. And came back to 
California, where I had been the better part of my

09:55.000 --> 10:03.852
youth. And got a position in San Bernardino as the 
third man on a three-man staff. and for the city yes

10:15.310 --> 10:44.440
Dick Garrett was my immediate superior very a good 
person and a good planner I think I disagree with

10:15.310 --> 10:44.440
some of the directions that the program is going 
but that had nothing to do with the fact that I was

10:15.310 --> 10:44.440
lucky to get a opportunity to go to Stockton a year 
after I'd been in in San Bernardino, and became a

10:45.719 --> 10:56.530
member of the staff under Stan Ott. When he 
resigned, I was selected as the planning

10:56.590 --> 11:01.095
director. What year was that?

11:08.062 --> 11:13.988
That would have been about 55, 54, 55.

11:14.913 --> 11:16.935
I was in Mill Valley at that time. Yeah, right. I 
occasionally ran into you in the AIP meetings.

11:21.361 --> 11:21.681
Yeah. Yeah, the Northern California section. And 
I stayed in Stockton for about 10 years, I guess. 10

11:31.713 --> 11:37.059
years as planning director. That's quite a long 
time. Yeah, it was. Went through one of the early

11:39.442 --> 11:44.768
urban renewal programs that

11:48.781 --> 11:55.069
We worked with,

11:48.781 --> 11:55.069
I'll drop another name. I can't think of it right 
now. John Hurt. John Hurt. H-I-R-T-O-N. E-N. E-N.

12:04.541 --> 12:12.311
He was one of the early bright young boys in urban 
renewal. Was he with the Chamber of Commerce

12:12.992 --> 12:18.619
originally in Stockton? No, I don't believe so. He 
was selected by the, I was interim head of the urban

12:22.843 --> 12:28.413
renewal program. They didn't have a formal 
director for about a year. So as planning

12:32.521 --> 12:35.366
director, I sort of took over that duty also. We 
went to, I went to a conference, a narrow

12:36.248 --> 12:43.020
conference, I believe it was in St. Louis or 
someplace. And we heard about this young boy,

12:43.979 --> 12:49.065
young man who... N-A-H-R-O. Right. A young fellow 
who had been working with one of the well-known

12:50.807 --> 12:58.917
programs in Little Rock, Arkansas. I can't think 
of the director. At that time, he was a biggie. And

13:05.264 --> 13:13.294
so we were lucky, I thought, and it turned out he did 
a good job in Stockton, John, and went on to become

13:13.966 --> 13:22.999
UMTA and all those things in Washington and 
subsequently Spur in San Francisco and that. But

13:23.019 --> 13:31.532
get back to my historical background in planning. 
I left Stockton when an opportunity came up for a

13:31.552 --> 13:41.847
chance to work for a large quote-unquote 
engineering planning firm, Wilsingham and

13:43.582 --> 14:13.116
Blair, which later became Wilsingham, and spent 
two years there and became acquainted with such

13:43.582 --> 14:13.116
notable planners as Jesus Hinojosa, Robert 
Cornish, Joseph McGraw, and others. few others

14:14.412 --> 14:16.354
who didn't make it to A&M. It was sort of a breeding 
ground for, as it turned out, a sizable portion of

14:18.156 --> 14:29.008
the planning faculty later on at Texas A&M. And it 
really comprised the original faculty entirely.

14:32.692 --> 14:33.532
True. I was probably the first full-time faculty, 
if you exclude the fact that Joe McGraw was here

14:34.453 --> 14:43.423
first as the only paid help after having started 
the program with the help of then-President

14:43.994 --> 15:06.285
General Rutter and most effectively, Edward 
Romanek, who Joseph McGraw had worked with and

14:43.994 --> 15:06.285
gone to school with, I believe, earlier. I think in 
Oklahoma. Yeah. And interestingly enough, Joe,

15:10.150 --> 15:13.815
in his previous experience at A&M, taught to 
undergrad Jesus or Chewie in architecture.

15:23.766 --> 15:26.010
So we all had sort of an architectural background. 
In fact, we all did. All sort of us. Yeah, right.

15:31.758 --> 15:41.432
Which you would think had given the program a 
pretty sharp, definite, physical direction. But

15:42.714 --> 15:44.697
because of the nature of it, the four that I 
mentioned, which were basically the faculty for

15:45.571 --> 15:57.182
the first 10 years,

15:45.571 --> 15:57.182
we didn't overemphasize that. I don't think 
consciously, but it just, particularly when I

15:58.804 --> 16:13.958
joined the faculty in 66,

15:58.804 --> 16:13.958
Joe had started the program with six students, one 
of which was a former neighbor in San Bruno,

16:14.478 --> 16:20.645
California, that he solicited to come. Who was 
that? Mike Harney. Mike Harney? You remember him,

16:25.351 --> 16:28.955
don't you? And incidentally, among the six first 
students were one of the few blacks that's gone

16:29.937 --> 16:39.068
through the program. I was thinking the other day 
that since there were six students, we had Some 16

16:44.836 --> 16:50.204
percent of the student body were minority blacks. 
It was just higher than the history of the program

16:50.905 --> 16:56.252
or the history of A&M. Is Mike black? No. This was 
Wendell Smith. Oh, Wendell, yeah. Whose father

17:00.979 --> 17:05.105
was dean at Prairie View at the time. Yeah, of 
engineering. Yeah. Well, was he in the first

17:07.989 --> 17:09.391
class? Either the first or second, very close to 
it. Well, you know, Wendell was responsible for me

17:14.317 --> 17:18.302
being at A&M. No, I didn't know that. Oh, yes. 
Should I tell you how that happened? I think that's

17:23.649 --> 17:25.131
pertinent to the paper. Sure. Joe McGraw, when 
Wendell graduated, he told Wendell to get out of

17:28.355 --> 17:37.126
Texas, that he had no future in Texas. He should go 
to California. And when he got to California, he

17:39.106 --> 17:45.733
suggested that he look up some of Joe's old 
friends, and I was one of them. So Wendell called me

17:46.514 --> 17:49.837
on the telephone and invited me to dinner. And they 
were living in Menlo Park, East Menlo Park, which,

17:51.259 --> 17:55.363
of course, is all black. And also there at that same 
meeting was Cliff Graves and his wife. And Cliff

18:03.412 --> 18:08.337
had just returned from Washington, DC, where he 
had been looking for housing. as he had been

18:08.924 --> 18:21.461
appointed an assistant to the director of Bureau 
of Management and Budget in the Nixon

18:08.924 --> 18:21.461
administration.

18:24.625 --> 18:29.251
So there were four blacks and one white at Denrick. 
And it was the first time I had been a minority. And

18:33.983 --> 18:51.330
it was really quite funny because they had gone 
around the table and everybody was talking about

18:33.983 --> 18:51.330
what they'd been doing lately and Cliff had and his 
wife, both very elegant people by the way, and

18:33.983 --> 18:51.330
Cliff is currently the county administrator for 
San Diego County. Cliff was enumerating the

18:53.833 --> 19:00.784
various amusing circumstances that they face 
when they got to Washington looking for housing as

19:01.169 --> 19:04.413
blacks. Because with his salary level, they could 
afford almost anything. And the very trumped-up

19:09.479 --> 19:15.607
stories they'd get when they looked at 
high-quality housing. And then it came my turn to

19:16.748 --> 19:20.333
say what I'd been doing lately. And I announced 
that I had resigned from ABAC the week before. And

19:25.339 --> 19:30.045
Wendell very seriously said, Bob, what is the 
region ever going to do without you? At which I

19:34.729 --> 19:38.594
laughed hysterically and said, the region will 
never even know I'm gone. But I had hoped to study

19:38.654 --> 19:59.745
landscape architecture privately and race my 
sailboat seriously and do some gardening and drop

19:38.654 --> 19:59.745
out for a couple of years, which at the time I could 
afford to do. And so apparently Wendell called Joe

20:00.518 --> 20:10.612
at Texas A&M and said, hey, this guy's on the loose. 
You better get a calling to him. And so that's what

20:14.817 --> 20:17.501
happened. So it's because we're black that I'm 
here at A&M.

20:22.908 --> 20:26.413
And I've talked with Wendell several times 
subsequently, and they're doing very well. And

20:27.034 --> 20:28.696
he's turned out to be an excellent planner. He's 
working for us. HEW in the San Francisco office

20:29.948 --> 20:33.131
now. He went to Union City first, I think. Yeah. As a 
planner. Yeah. And was there about a year, and the

20:37.495 --> 20:52.009
planning director left, and they pushed him into 
the role of acting planning director, and I told

20:37.495 --> 20:52.009
him not to take it unless they gave him the salary 
and the title to go with the responsibility. And he

20:52.029 --> 20:57.795
then forced their hand, and he did become the 
planning director. which was quite something to

20:58.433 --> 21:04.923
be a black and a planning director, even in 
California in those days. But then he left and went

21:06.666 --> 21:20.727
to HUD in the San Francisco regional office, and 
did some good work for HUD, and then went on to HEW in

21:06.666 --> 21:20.727
terms of civil rights and that sort of thing. 
You're still in San Francisco? Still, and they're

21:22.089 --> 21:26.736
living in Fremont, as far as I know.

21:28.555 --> 21:33.801
We had some interesting people back in those days, 
to say the least. In fact, I was thinking the other

21:35.363 --> 21:43.693
day about the difference in the kinds of students 
from the early, say, 20 years ago. And today,

21:45.295 --> 21:52.504
although I haven't been in the last two or three 
years that close to the students, I have taught a

21:53.176 --> 22:01.689
class, and I have a rough idea of what some of them 
are like, today's students are like. In some

22:01.849 --> 22:21.698
respects, it's a little disappointing, because I 
think most of us, what I mean, the early faculty,

22:01.849 --> 22:21.698
let's call them the four horsemen,

22:01.849 --> 22:21.698
were fairly activist-oriented.

22:22.555 --> 22:36.688
not, what's the word I'm thinking of, the old 
advocacy types necessarily, because all

22:22.555 --> 22:36.688
planning was advocacy, and you're not a planner 
unless you're advocating something. But anyway,

22:36.708 --> 22:50.520
we were all fairly active, and our students, I 
think, made us that way, even if we didn't want to be

22:36.708 --> 22:50.520
in it, They were oriented toward what was going on 
in the world. And this was the late 60s that I

22:55.831 --> 22:59.574
started. So there was still that feeling from the, 
that characterized the 60s now. The era of social

23:07.441 --> 23:09.403
unrest. Right. And consciousness, social 
consciousness among the students was much more

23:10.284 --> 23:19.292
evident than it is, I think, today. And that's not 
necessarily bad. That's a reflection of the

23:21.579 --> 23:29.971
country, obviously, and the nature of society 
generally today. But I think we missed a little

23:30.752 --> 23:32.455
something. For instance, we are missing it now. We

23:34.778 --> 23:47.777
had the two cities had a group, maybe you remember 
it, called Twin City

23:50.913 --> 23:56.439
I'm thinking it's mission because there is such a 
thing, but it was a Twin City organization. I don't

23:56.579 --> 23:58.821
know what, that's not important. But it was a 
spinoff or an outgrowth of the Martin Luther King

23:58.841 --> 24:16.920
assassination, and I can't think of when that was, 
but it was a little later on in the period, where

23:58.841 --> 24:16.920
this informal group of not necessarily all black, 
but just all people who were interested in

24:18.368 --> 24:28.600
bettering social conditions, got together on a 
local level, two cities. Of course, Bryan has, as

24:28.660 --> 24:35.147
had then as it has now, a predominance of black 
people. And the college station had, obviously,

24:35.167 --> 24:40.473
the students. And the two got along pretty well, 
the two groups. They did some interesting things.

24:48.067 --> 25:08.652
That was also the time where I believe where some of 
our students along with the primary stimulus I

24:48.067 --> 25:08.652
think was architecture students got this house 
loaned to them over there in the east side of town

24:48.067 --> 25:08.652
and put some sweat into it and build a thing. It 
never really came off. It was called Cisco. Right.

25:14.765 --> 25:16.187
It had good intentions. They were doing it in other 
parts of the country. Yeah, community design

25:20.093 --> 25:23.879
centers. Yeah, design centers. It never came off 
as well as it might have. But to me, an example of

25:29.207 --> 25:35.317
what isn't happening today. You know, I took a 
group of architecture students back to Howard

25:37.019 --> 25:42.628
University. And when I was here, my first year in 
the Department of Architecture, I became the

25:43.351 --> 25:54.124
faculty lead on the Cisco project. Oh, you did? 
Yeah. I went back to Howard with them for a

25:55.225 --> 26:05.077
conference of all the people from around the 
country that were involved with community design

25:55.225 --> 26:05.077
centers. And that provided some real stimulus to 
the program here. And that continued for another

26:10.132 --> 26:17.623
couple of years, and then it just sort of fell by the 
wayside.

26:17.643 --> 26:19.266
I'm not sure where in the sequence. I was, again, 
thinking of how the outreach type thing

26:19.646 --> 26:31.704
manifested itself in two other things. One was, 
that I can recall, one was a proposal to locate a

26:31.844 --> 26:38.434
high school and college station. which had a lot of 
planning implications, we thought. And so the

26:44.376 --> 26:58.074
faculty, I think maybe they were just Joe and I at 
that time, took a pretty strong position and we

26:44.376 --> 26:58.074
went to the meetings and had great arguments with 
the people on the other side. And the students did

26:58.734 --> 26:59.796
too. They made up brochures and handed them out and 
flyers and handed them out. And we had a great

27:06.882 --> 27:14.093
rapport with the faculty and students on an issue 
outside of the classroom. Another one was an

27:15.475 --> 27:20.944
effort by, of course, that issue was finally 
decided by Bill Finch. Yeah. We simply gave the

27:22.166 --> 27:34.425
site to the city, or the school board, in effect, 
and claimed that the other site, which we thought

27:22.166 --> 27:34.425
was better, couldn't be obtained because it was a 
little old lady who Pappy said, Daddy said, always

27:34.979 --> 27:40.207
stay with the land that you live in. You don't have 
any problems at all. Anyway, another one was even

27:43.292 --> 27:54.129
more interesting, I think, because it got really 
into some serious politics, namely university.

27:54.309 --> 28:01.240
When the university wanted to set up an airport 
authority, and Joe at that time, Joe McGraw had

27:54.309 --> 28:01.240
been had run for council and been elected. I think 
the first time he ran, he was not elected. And he was

28:06.725 --> 28:18.215
elected and called for, because they were going to 
tie in the two cities and the county, but not give

28:06.725 --> 28:18.215
them the proper authority. The university was 
still going to run the show, but the tax base was

28:18.996 --> 28:23.881
going to be from the cities. Anyway, it's too 
complicated to get into here. But subsequently,

28:27.304 --> 28:31.227
he got it to he and others to the point where they had 
to have a referendum on it, and they turned it down.

28:36.251 --> 28:45.319
And the faculty and students were quite active 
outwardly on that issue too. We don't want to get

28:47.381 --> 28:58.310
into it probably, but it led to interesting 
subsequent events regarding Joe McGraw's career

28:47.381 --> 28:58.310
as head of the department. It ended up saving the 
taxpayers quite a bit of money. Yeah. I think the

29:02.780 --> 29:10.592
fact that it's been now 10 or 12 years and they got 
along fine without it shows something. No, it was a

29:10.612 --> 29:12.935
bad thing. Not terribly bad, but it just

29:13.917 --> 29:25.614
didn't make good sense. So, what courses were you 
responsible for when you got here? And you were

29:32.902 --> 29:34.724
here in 1965? Six. I think Joe started the program 
in 65, and I came the next year. And you were number

29:42.953 --> 29:45.455
two on the faculty. Well, I like to say I was number 
one, but he was administrator and faculty. And

29:53.824 --> 29:57.188
then after you, it was Chewy. I don't know whether 
it was Chewy or you. I lost track. I think Chewie was

30:02.011 --> 30:07.839
here in the summer of 1969, and I arrived in 
October. And then he left right away for South

30:10.021 --> 30:14.347
America, Central and Latin America. Yeah, Chile. 
Yeah. Well, to answer your question, which was

30:17.411 --> 30:22.177
what? What did classes that I- Yeah, what part of 
the curriculum did you handle? I think I, at that

30:31.205 --> 30:45.382
time, we stressed what we call labs more, the six 
unit practical courses in applied planning, if

30:31.205 --> 30:45.382
you will. And one of the earliest was, 
interestingly enough, a plan for Texas City. We

30:54.413 --> 30:59.018
called it a preliminary plan, and it was.

31:01.124 --> 31:12.555
It stimulated, I think, planning, well, more 
intensive planning down there. And it just

31:12.575 --> 31:17.960
happens that they came back a couple of years ago. 
Julie and I were involved with Texas City again on

31:18.000 --> 31:26.588
sort of another plan, an update. But 
interestingly out of that, it might be

31:26.608 --> 31:30.692
interesting that This triggered quite a concern, 
it seems, by our colleagues in the, at that time,

31:32.393 --> 31:53.918
the American Institute of Planners, AIP, in that 
the college here using student labor was doing

31:32.393 --> 31:53.918
planning

31:32.393 --> 31:53.918
that should be done by consultants. We had made it 
very clear that these were not professional,

31:55.199 --> 32:01.827
quote unquote, plans, both to the client and to 
anybody that wanted to ask about it. And it went so

32:10.556 --> 32:23.833
far as that they had a big brouhaha, and I wrote an 
answer to it which was pretty favorably received.

32:23.933 --> 32:31.543
I can't find it nowadays, but in which I quoted the 
fact that the profession in there Constitution or

32:32.519 --> 32:46.680
whatever it is at that time, said that one of their 
responsibilities was to work with students, give

32:32.519 --> 32:46.680
to students. And it all worked out pretty well. And 
my main point was that... And they had an

32:48.403 --> 32:53.170
educational responsibility as a chapter. Right. 
As they do now, as you well know, having them

32:54.953 --> 32:58.438
involved. But as it turned out, I think we What we 
said was that this will probably stimulate more

33:01.814 --> 33:06.722
work for consultants. It turned out Texas City did 
hire a consultant later, as well as a lot of other

33:06.922 --> 33:14.033
cities. But what I want to point out is that we early 
on took the so-called hands-on approach of

33:14.234 --> 33:29.458
so-called real-life situation and used that. in 
the lab. I taught those. I also sort of specialized

33:33.802 --> 33:39.529
in the plan implementation. I was one of the West 
Coast, being one of the West Coast group, was a

33:40.110 --> 33:59.614
disciple of the comprehensive physical plan, 
more or less, without getting into the

33:40.110 --> 33:59.614
implications of the other aspects of it. and tried 
to embody that in both the lab and implementing the

34:00.522 --> 34:07.412
plan. I might add that Joe McGraw took the first 
plunge and became a councilman. I think I

34:15.663 --> 34:16.965
mentioned that earlier. And I was appointed 
fairly early on to the Planning and Zoning

34:17.987 --> 34:29.483
Commission and put in four years there and then I 
decided to get some experiences being one of the

34:31.471 --> 34:40.845
decision makers and ran for city council and 
served two terms. And what I'm reciting that for is

34:42.027 --> 34:57.090
to sort of reinforce the fact that my one of my keen 
interests is in the political aspects of planning

34:42.027 --> 34:57.090
and the implementation of it. How do you make the 
plan work? In the accreditation team visit, it was

35:01.536 --> 35:23.533
pointed out that our curriculum was somewhat 
short on the political and implementation

35:01.536 --> 35:23.533
aspects of planning education. And it seems to me 
that that was one of your contributions, that you

35:24.644 --> 35:41.901
seemed to be able to bring to the department an 
interest in public policy that other faculty

35:24.644 --> 35:41.901
members didn't. I mean, that seemed to be your 
particular interest. Well, I appreciate your

35:46.346 --> 35:54.634
keen awareness

35:46.346 --> 35:54.634
of that. Well, I took it at a pretty basic level.

36:00.855 --> 36:11.905
I wouldn't lay claim to being any kind of a 
policymaker, except as the plan makes policy. And

36:11.925 --> 36:25.077
that we want the politicians to lay out, either 
through the plan or their own platform, their own

36:11.925 --> 36:25.077
agenda, whatever, some sort of guidelines for the 
future and stick to them and make them

36:26.137 --> 36:30.623
accountable. To me, that's the politics of 
planning. You get things done. Well, then you

36:38.513 --> 36:44.521
served two terms on the council and then you went 
off the council. Yeah, we flip-flopped around, we

36:44.661 --> 36:53.393
the city, I'm speaking of, between having a total 
at-large election to award system, or a

36:53.828 --> 36:58.472
combination of both. I wasn't too happy with that. 
And so I just bowed out for about nine years. But

37:08.081 --> 37:12.025
during that nine years, I ran three times 
unsuccessfully. I shouldn't mention that to

37:12.085 --> 37:16.529
posterity, but that's the case. And then last 
April, April 87, I ran again and made it. help some

37:24.389 --> 37:26.011
of my friends. And a new mayor. Right. So now you're 
on the council again, doing good works for College

37:32.499 --> 37:37.305
Station. Well, we haven't done much. Of course, 
it's only been three months or so, but there

37:38.546 --> 37:51.983
haven't been any major issues as there were during 
that interim, like the location of a plant.

37:52.807 --> 38:07.468
without too much planning thought into an 
establishment of a supposedly high-tech

37:52.807 --> 38:07.468
industrial park, which is yet to see any industry 
at all. That being one of my favorite issues that I

38:08.409 --> 38:14.057
ran on. Of course I lost on it three times, but I 
finally I'm not sure that it was for that reason,

38:17.242 --> 38:24.428
but maybe it was. It suffered from a lack of any kind 
of planning, really. Looking at the department

38:29.493 --> 38:44.186
now that you are on a, what shall I say, a leisure 
schedule here, teaching about one class a year, is

38:29.493 --> 38:44.186
it? That's right. And you're essentially 
looking, your point of view is different. How

38:51.094 --> 39:02.885
would you characterize any changes that have 
occurred in the department in terms of planning

38:51.094 --> 39:02.885
education and its administration and its 
offering and so forth?

39:07.629 --> 39:14.535
Without getting too specific, I think it's a 
reflection of

39:15.545 --> 39:20.772
the people who are the head of the department. I 
think some of the things that went on early on were

39:20.792 --> 39:32.888
pretty much a reflection of the leaders and the 
faculty, and particularly the students. Do you

39:33.689 --> 39:41.620
realize that at one time you and I were the only 
persons on the faculty who had not served as

39:33.689 --> 39:41.620
department head? Yeah. And so there have been 
changes, as you know, in the last 20 years, and I'm

39:45.329 --> 39:59.891
speaking of that time span being my tenure, more or 
less. So not only did The times change and the

40:03.402 --> 40:09.168
students change, but the leadership of the 
program changed. And it's to be expected that

40:09.388 --> 40:30.270
there'd be a reflection or a re-emphasis or an 
emphasis on

40:09.388 --> 40:30.270
not only our administration in the department, 
but other administrative levels of the

40:09.388 --> 40:30.270
university. principally the college, and of 
course we've gone through a lot of changes in the

40:31.043 --> 40:36.888
deanship, too.

40:39.671 --> 40:55.345
Well, that leads to certain instability and 
concern for what the future is going to be of not

40:39.671 --> 40:55.345
only our department, but the college. You know, we 
started as a part of of the engineering college,

41:00.237 --> 41:04.163
which was a good stable. That was the place to be at 
that time if you wanted the money and the stability

41:04.203 --> 41:12.174
and the power. Of course, some of that has shifted 
now to other colleges. Once we got our own college,

41:17.001 --> 41:26.835
things changed too.

41:29.043 --> 41:42.383
A major thing, of course, and again, as I think I 
mentioned earlier on in this discussion, the

41:29.043 --> 41:42.383
students are a reflection of our national 
condition.

41:42.403 --> 41:46.690
And we have to expect change. As I said when I talked 
to you earlier, I'm not as close to the students

41:48.713 --> 41:57.025
because I only teach the one class once a year. And 
then, of course, now we have expanded from the MUP

41:57.730 --> 42:06.498
degree into a PhD and an MSLD. And a lot of students 
that I see out here today are not MUP students.

42:14.444 --> 42:15.625
They're MSLD students. And they're different. 
They have different expectations and different

42:17.747 --> 42:21.310
professional goals. And they're different kinds 
of folks than the MUP students are. and that's

42:27.717 --> 42:52.797
again to be expected they come from different 
backgrounds and they certainly are looking for

42:27.717 --> 42:52.797
quite different things out of their practice when 
they leave here there aren't many of us on

42:27.717 --> 42:52.797
on the faculties of the different departments in 
the university that are not a PhD, PhD level as you

42:54.008 --> 43:01.739
know. And not many realized that at the time we, you 
and I, and a few others came into it, there was no PhD

43:01.759 --> 43:11.013
program anywhere. And I think Don Foley, I don't 
think he got it in planning from UC, I think it was

43:12.234 --> 43:21.728
sociology or something. So That's right. He was 
the first person I called doctor, academically.

43:29.948 --> 43:46.586
But now the emphasis is on research, a lot of it, 
which goes along with the PhD

43:29.948 --> 43:46.586
program and requirement for being a member of the 
faculty. Research and publication. And we could

43:51.468 --> 44:02.539
spend another hour on that.

44:02.559 --> 44:03.641
Well, it has changed. The

44:03.821 --> 44:19.517
person without a Ph.D. has almost no chance of 
being admitted to higher education today.

44:20.864 --> 44:27.193
It's simply not possible to join a faculty without 
it. Whereas I think you're quite right. When we

44:28.955 --> 44:43.716
were in the process of moving from practice into 
education, there was no way of getting a PhD in

44:28.955 --> 44:43.716
planning. And in fact, if you look at this faculty 
today, there isn't one person on this faculty that

44:44.928 --> 44:54.638
has a PhD in planning.

44:54.658 --> 44:55.859
They're in something else. Economics in the case 
of Stover, or jurisprudence in the case of Pugh, or

44:57.220 --> 45:11.695
a foreign doctorate from Germany in the case of 
Wolfgang.

45:13.767 --> 45:27.321
And I guess that Sherry Boehm has a PhD

45:13.767 --> 45:27.321
centered around health care from the University 
of Michigan.
