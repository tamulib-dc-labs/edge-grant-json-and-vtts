00:02.410 --> 00:22.998
July 26, looking out into the large green backyard at the Andersons' home and getting ready to talk about the 1930s and years after that.

00:23.618 --> 00:25.020
Test your mic now, please.

00:25.180 --> 00:26.402
All right.

00:26.422 --> 00:29.346
I think I'm ready to talk about the 1930s.

00:31.722 --> 00:44.432
As the Depression began to have its effects on the campus and your family, can you remember any examples of

00:46.184 --> 00:48.367
those depression difficulties?

00:50.791 --> 00:51.031
Yes.

00:52.433 --> 01:06.714
One of the memories I have of the Depression is that people who were riding the rails, who were unemployed, would walk over to the faculty houses and ask for food.

01:06.734 --> 01:10.740
And I can very distinctly remember people coming to our back door.

01:10.720 --> 01:19.719
and they would be given a meal and then they'd go back to the tracks and ride the rails to wherever they were going.

01:20.120 --> 01:23.226
These were, of course, unemployed people.

01:23.387 --> 01:24.589
Describe these.

01:24.970 --> 01:26.333
I presume they were male.

01:26.752 --> 01:40.345
Yes, they were men in their 20s and 30s, and maybe not well-shaven and so forth, and obviously tough circumstances.

01:40.365 --> 01:40.825
Anglo?

01:41.246 --> 01:42.507
Yes, yes.

01:42.527 --> 01:43.608
Did they come to the front door?

01:44.308 --> 01:45.229
Came to the back door.

01:46.611 --> 01:49.273
What would they normally say?

01:49.293 --> 01:53.417
Well, they would ask for food, and I can recall one,

01:54.308 --> 01:58.613
spoke very sharply to our maid, and my dad told him to leave.

01:59.634 --> 02:02.478
But the others were, of course, given food.

02:03.219 --> 02:05.822
This man was very disrespectful of Ruby.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.745
Was there usually an offer of work?

02:09.146 --> 02:13.851
Not that I recall, no, no.

02:14.352 --> 02:17.616
Do you remember the Depression's effect on your family much?

02:18.423 --> 02:24.731
Well, most of the families on the campus were not severely affected.

02:26.072 --> 02:31.479
In the athletic department, the salaries were reduced, I think, by 25 percent during that time.

02:32.260 --> 02:38.608
But this, of course, did not cause people to not be able to do basic things.

02:38.588 --> 02:45.857
And from the viewpoint of a child, we were really not affected by it very much.

02:46.257 --> 02:56.870
And it was the fact that growing up on the campus was really a very positive event for a child.

02:57.351 --> 03:02.537
And maybe it's one reason I came back here to practice in my memories of my growing up here.

03:03.293 --> 03:12.592
We went to school on the campus, which meant two blocks to school.

03:13.194 --> 03:21.471
As I probably mentioned already, in the summer we went and swam in the college pool.

03:21.451 --> 03:35.067
My particular neighborhood was almost all young boys as far as the children were concerned, Mary Leland being the only girl, and the two Gammon boys next to us on the other side.

03:35.548 --> 03:40.454
Leland's on the south of our house, Tom and Mary.

03:42.096 --> 03:47.222
Buddy Williams in the house behind us and his older daughter Jane Ann.

03:47.202 --> 03:58.943
The Knox Walkers had two boys who lived across the street from the Williams, and the Boltons lived on the corner.

04:00.345 --> 04:06.756
We lived on Houston Street, and they lived on the street just east of Houston in parallel to it.

04:06.816 --> 04:11.725
In the summers, Bill Eccles, their grandson, lived with them, stayed with them.

04:11.705 --> 04:18.033
And also during World War II when his father was overseas, the Eccles lived with the Bolton.

04:18.073 --> 04:20.897
So Bill was very much a part of our neighborhood.

04:21.558 --> 04:25.302
In fact, he was my freshman roommate in college.

04:26.584 --> 04:28.827
But we had a lot to do as youngsters.

04:30.990 --> 04:35.856
There were hedges and there were plenty of places to play chase and to

04:35.836 --> 04:37.800
have our acorn fights.

04:37.980 --> 04:47.479
And as I mentioned, I think, earlier, that Gunnar Gadman invented a so-called firecracker cannon that we used on one occasion I've already talked about.

04:48.522 --> 04:54.233
As we grew a little older, we played touch football.

04:54.213 --> 04:59.041
on the grounds of the block that Guyon Hall was on.

05:00.103 --> 05:07.335
Of course, Guyon Hall also was inside the site of the movies that were shown on campus.

05:07.816 --> 05:10.500
Everything was close by and there was a lot to do.

05:10.480 --> 05:15.712
What were those movies, what were some of the movies that you most specially remember?

05:16.253 --> 05:22.187
You know, I don't know that I can isolate or pick out one.

05:23.189 --> 05:26.617
On weekends, we would be taken to the Dixie Theater.

05:26.697 --> 05:29.383
This is when we were 7, 8, 9, 10.

05:29.363 --> 05:32.188
to a cowboy movie.

05:32.528 --> 05:38.378
And I think Buck Jones was in his heyday at that point.

05:38.398 --> 05:48.736
This was a little after Tom Mix and a little before Roy Rogers, not Roy Rogers, but the one before Roy Rogers and after Buck Jones.

05:49.277 --> 05:51.501
He was just beginning to enter the picture.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.105
And my brother, I guess,

05:55.165 --> 06:05.544
achieved some degree of fame on one occasion when the cowboy and his girlfriend were having a moment of conversation.

06:06.285 --> 06:10.653
It was very quiet for a moment in the theater.

06:11.475 --> 06:15.081
Wally said, more shooting and less loving.

06:16.023 --> 06:23.753
And since there was no other voice or noise in the theater at that time, he realized that he was sort of the center of everybody's attention.

06:23.793 --> 06:28.800
So he crept down in his chair, sort of scooted down.

06:28.820 --> 06:30.102
Now that was a matinee.

06:30.462 --> 06:31.684
Yes, this afternoon.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.688
And would your mother take you down there?

06:34.708 --> 06:35.970
One of the mothers would take us.

06:36.090 --> 06:37.172
Mother often did.

06:37.512 --> 06:40.236
And so, and the audience would largely be children.

06:40.256 --> 06:41.237
Yes.

06:41.217 --> 06:51.798
And for the cowboy movies, mainly little boys, which meant that in our particular case, since our neighborhood was mainly boys, all the little kids went with us.

06:51.818 --> 06:56.627
Did you all wander over to the railroad station near the campus very often?

06:56.607 --> 06:58.629
Not so much as little children.

06:58.649 --> 07:08.740
Of course, the railroad station was, if someone were coming into town, and my parents were picking them up, we'd be there.

07:09.581 --> 07:20.472
And during the war, World War II, when we were older, of course, my dad was stationed at Fort Sill, and he used to come in on the train every two or three weekends.

07:20.452 --> 07:31.452
But for some people, I'm not talking about children, but adults, just going to the station to see the train coming in was sort of quite an event.

07:31.472 --> 07:40.789
And then the creamery was just west of the station, so you could go and buy some ice cream, too, if it were earlier in the day.

07:40.769 --> 08:03.840
I think I've already mentioned that after we call it the new administration building was installed in about 1935, that was a favorite location to ride our bicycles over to and ride around the sidewalks and the gardens in front.

08:03.820 --> 08:08.124
Did you see Aggies hitchhiking in the 30s?

08:08.184 --> 08:10.526
Yes, that was a common practice.

08:10.546 --> 08:12.087
Where did they do that?

08:13.408 --> 08:33.625
Their main point, in fact the point really was, at least for north and south travel, was on the east side of the campus where the road in front of the new administration building intersected Highway 6, which is now Texas Avenue.

08:33.605 --> 08:38.551
And I can remember this very well, too, when I was a student.

08:38.571 --> 08:48.363
You know, there might be 75 or 100 people lined up, and you moved up the line depending on your position related to how long you'd been there.

08:49.244 --> 08:56.473
And there was one line, and so there was nobody jostling to get ahead or anything of that sort.

08:56.453 --> 09:01.040
class rank and or year of class didn't matter.

09:01.501 --> 09:02.202
Not for that.

09:02.623 --> 09:03.304
Did you ever?

09:03.364 --> 09:05.707
For everything else, yes, but not for that.

09:06.148 --> 09:11.957
I have not yet encountered any negative stories about hitchhiking.

09:11.977 --> 09:14.501
Do you remember anybody ever having something happen?

09:14.521 --> 09:15.643
No, no, I don't remember.

09:15.623 --> 09:20.949
any accident or injuries or any assaults or anything of that sort.

09:21.810 --> 09:24.172
And many cars picked people up.

09:24.212 --> 09:26.174
It wasn't just the occasional car either.

09:26.234 --> 09:26.955
That's what I've heard.

09:26.995 --> 09:27.556
Yes.

09:27.576 --> 09:37.006
And that quite often would pick up more than one so that the first person in line might then have two or three join him.

09:37.026 --> 09:39.368
They were going the same direction, yeah.

09:39.388 --> 09:40.169
All right.

09:40.469 --> 09:43.092
And this worked all over the state, didn't it, with Aggies?

09:43.913 --> 09:43.993
Yes.

09:43.973 --> 09:58.004
My dad once picked up a young man who turned out was a French artillery lieutenant who had taken his leave time to come to this country and see the United States.

09:58.104 --> 10:02.995
And so the young fellow got in the car.

10:02.975 --> 10:11.269
Then Dad mentioned that he had been in France as an artilleryman in the war and was a colonel at the time they were talking.

10:13.774 --> 10:15.457
We had a farm south of Navasota.

10:18.061 --> 10:25.033
Dad was taking down some natural fertilizer to put around some oak trees he had planted.

10:25.013 --> 10:43.156
And so he had a trailer behind the car, and so when the lieutenant heard Dad say that he was an artillery colonel, he looked around and pointed to the trailer with the manure and said, with that?

10:46.721 --> 10:51.527
Presumably a French artillery colonel would not have had that.

10:51.895 --> 11:06.816
At what point did, were you aware, and other youngsters your age, at what point were you aware of the world events that might involve you and your family in the United States?

11:07.257 --> 11:21.177
Well, probably my first introduction to that was one of our neighbors in the first house, Mr. Marburger, who obviously was of German descent.

11:21.157 --> 11:27.960
And he would come over and talk to Dad, even when we moved to our second location.

11:29.155 --> 11:31.498
And he was concerned about Russia.

11:33.220 --> 11:36.344
And, of course, I think that's true of the Germans.

11:36.384 --> 11:52.345
They've always had this either feeling they wanted to take over Russia or the lands, extensive lands, or were just fearful of the Russians finally putting their act together.

11:53.945 --> 12:12.780
I think probably I didn't know I can remember the newsreels and the Chamberlain going to Munich regarding Czechoslovakia and that sort of thing.

12:12.760 --> 12:21.270
But I don't think I really realized the import of that, but I can remember those things.

12:21.290 --> 12:39.072
And then, of course, when the war came, I actually put together a scrapbook, a World War II scrapbook, and stayed very much in contact with it through Life magazine pictures and so forth.

12:39.052 --> 12:43.661
Where were you when you heard the December 7th news?

12:44.923 --> 12:56.184
When President Roosevelt spoke, it was during the school week, and our superintendent actually arranged the PA systems of all rooms.

12:56.966 --> 12:59.170
Of course, I was not in high school at that time.

12:59.150 --> 13:11.795
still in junior high, that his talk to Congress was carried over the PA system.

13:11.896 --> 13:17.547
And that was an extremely sobering moment, even for a child.

13:19.298 --> 13:29.520
And, of course, I was young enough so that it wasn't until a few years later that people I knew, you know, closely were going into the service.

13:29.600 --> 13:34.050
And by the time I finished in high school in 1946,

13:34.435 --> 13:38.180
The war was all but over at that point.

13:39.081 --> 13:45.930
When did the A&M student body begin to leave in large numbers?

13:46.651 --> 13:47.893
Did they get called away?

13:48.033 --> 13:48.274
Yes.

13:50.216 --> 13:59.929
In 1942, A&M had actually had a rather meteoric increase in enrollment in the early 1920s.

13:59.949 --> 14:04.155
I think it was like 1500 or maybe up to 2000.

14:04.135 --> 14:10.965
middle 30s, it was 3,500, and then all of a sudden, by about 1941, it was over 6,000.

14:10.985 --> 14:21.921
And some of this might have been due to the fact that people realized the war was coming and maybe there was some advice to go to a school that had military training.

14:22.962 --> 14:26.447
But the class of 43, I think, was

14:27.575 --> 14:34.867
either graduated early or given their commissions early without graduating in 1942, as I recall.

14:36.009 --> 14:48.250
And of course, at that point, the enrollment at A&M markedly decreased, and it was under 2000 during most of the later years of the war.

14:48.230 --> 14:54.080
And faculty members began to be activated?

14:54.221 --> 14:55.062
Yes.

14:55.082 --> 14:57.867
My father went on active duty in 1942, and D.W.

14:59.310 --> 15:02.716
Williams went on active duty probably about the same time.

15:02.836 --> 15:09.327
And he was head of the animal science department at that time, and J.T.L.

15:09.347 --> 15:10.930
McNew, Sr.,

15:12.445 --> 15:23.354
Civil engineering head on active duty, all of them, same time frame, and many others, too, I didn't know so well.

15:23.835 --> 15:26.522
Now, you faculty families

15:27.008 --> 15:32.477
When the man of the house was called away, did you all remain on the campus in the faculty residence?

15:32.497 --> 15:34.540
Well, now this was, see, 1942.

15:34.600 --> 15:44.916
Now most, literally everyone had moved off by 1940 or very early 41, but 40 was really the transition time, yeah.

15:44.896 --> 15:59.918
And of course, the Victory Gardens, everyone had at that point to provide food, and there was gas rationing.

15:59.898 --> 16:10.691
four gallons a month or something like that per car, unless there was a special need involved for the owner's use.

16:10.711 --> 16:15.516
And there was some rationing of food.

16:15.556 --> 16:19.240
I don't remember in detail what, but sugar maybe or something.

16:19.621 --> 16:24.066
Now, your dad had, he's called on active duty at what rank?

16:24.333 --> 16:25.014
As a colonel.

16:25.314 --> 16:26.916
As a colonel in the artillery?

16:27.016 --> 16:28.457
Yes.

16:29.038 --> 16:31.801
Describe his wartime experience as well.

16:31.821 --> 16:45.696
His experience, he went to Fort Sill and he was one of eight or nine full colonels who were called, were allowed.

16:46.397 --> 16:51.522
They were, I know the telegram the dad received said that he

16:51.502 --> 16:55.167
if he chose, could go on active duty.

16:55.187 --> 17:01.336
And apparently, with that rank, it was more of a choice than just a requirement.

17:01.937 --> 17:11.011
In fact, I think the Army would have been probably just as happy if many of the senior officers had not gone on active duty because they had enough of them.

17:11.631 --> 17:18.201
But he chose to go on active duty, and he spent time at Fort Sill.

17:18.181 --> 17:31.281
and going through two schools of artillery there, which was basically sort of an update on the change in artillery methods between the two World Wars.

17:31.301 --> 17:36.409
And then he spent time at Fort Bragg

17:36.389 --> 17:43.970
training, and he spent time also with the 30th Division in Tennessee.

17:43.990 --> 17:51.411
And he did not go overseas in the war.

17:51.391 --> 17:58.846
And then, of course, came back to NM and to the physical education department.

17:58.866 --> 18:00.249
When does he get back?

18:00.269 --> 18:01.853
In 45, 44, 44, yeah.

18:02.173 --> 18:02.414
44?

18:02.574 --> 18:04.398
Late 44, yeah.

18:04.759 --> 18:05.059
Okay.

18:05.821 --> 18:11.813
And so you, your mom and children are here.

18:12.215 --> 18:18.031
And I'm assuming you had a number of neighbors, exactly the same situation where?

18:21.280 --> 18:27.658
Yes.

18:27.638 --> 18:32.865
You know, I can remember my dad was a little older than the average.

18:33.866 --> 18:34.267
D.W.

18:34.287 --> 18:40.655
Williams was probably a little younger, and Lamar McNew was younger than that.

18:40.735 --> 18:48.145
But most of the people who went on active duty were in their 20s and 30s on the faculty.

18:48.125 --> 19:01.412
I think, was it Mr. Whitley or one of, I don't know if he went on the, if he was on the faculty before the war, but he came back on the faculty.

19:01.432 --> 19:03.276
He won a congressional medal.

19:03.296 --> 19:03.516
Yeah.

19:04.939 --> 19:07.905
But the younger people, I don't remember.

19:07.885 --> 19:13.994
just exactly how many, because I was more in contact with the friends of my parents.

19:14.635 --> 19:25.491
But I can remember at one party social event that one of the young wives of the faculty was just absolutely distraught, you know, her husband going overseas.

19:26.873 --> 19:32.802
And it was probably very tough on those people out of age range.

19:33.623 --> 19:35.766
Now, there were many

19:37.248 --> 19:45.885
training units sent here by Army and Army Air Corps, and I presume, were there Navy units also?

19:46.066 --> 19:47.909
I think there were, yes, there was a Navy unit.

19:48.571 --> 19:55.324
In fact, one of the physicians assigned to it stayed here in practice.

19:55.304 --> 19:57.226
Where did they, did they live?

19:57.246 --> 20:00.350
They had the Army Student Training, ASTP.

20:00.931 --> 20:03.774
Did they live on campus, those students, in dormitories?

20:03.794 --> 20:04.055
Yes.

20:04.936 --> 20:05.196
Uh-huh, yeah.

20:05.216 --> 20:15.428
Of course, and then with its massive amount of space for dormitories, could accommodate them during the war because there were not many students here.

20:16.650 --> 20:24.079
And there was a building, a large white frame structure

20:25.207 --> 20:45.831
one story that had been built for the AAA, which was one of the Roosevelt New Deal organizations, and that during the war was used as sort of the educational center for at least some of those.

20:45.811 --> 20:47.433
of the Navy at least, I think.

20:48.054 --> 20:58.029
And it was located more or less where the TV station on campus is now and in the parking lot just north of it.

20:58.049 --> 21:00.453
It covered quite an extensive area.

21:01.354 --> 21:07.583
Now, for you as a junior and then senior high student during the war years,

21:08.137 --> 21:23.040
Did the, with all of these non-Texan, these different, did your routine change much of community life and what you did for fun and so forth?

21:24.168 --> 21:26.151
Say that question one more time.

21:26.171 --> 21:35.665
Well, with the coming of these active duty personnel, did they cause much of a change in the lifestyle on the campus?

21:35.685 --> 21:37.127
No, they did not, no.

21:37.948 --> 21:38.689
They fitted in.

21:39.089 --> 21:49.264
Most of these were youngsters who were going to college, you know, or did with the government programs after the war, and they were selected because they were

21:49.244 --> 21:56.896
And so, as far as the type of person, it saw no difference.

21:56.956 --> 22:02.505
And of course, by that time, we were not living on the campus, so we didn't really interface with them that much.

22:02.825 --> 22:07.773
And you didn't hear any bad stories about their off-campus conduct?

22:07.793 --> 22:08.234
No.

22:08.254 --> 22:09.516
Making trouble or anything?

22:09.796 --> 22:13.041
No.

22:13.021 --> 22:22.500
Was there much change in the campus and the faculty and administrative leadership during the war?

22:24.905 --> 22:25.125
Yes.

22:25.626 --> 22:33.983
Dr. Walton, who had been president since the late 1920s, stepped down.

22:35.026 --> 22:37.933
and actually in time became the postmaster.

22:39.377 --> 22:52.849
And I think at that time it was enough of a time of change so that we were moving from sort of an agricultural

22:52.829 --> 22:58.398
maybe to a little more technological, or at least more urban.

22:59.640 --> 23:03.185
And he represented sort of the agricultural past.

23:03.205 --> 23:11.458
And so there was a shift away, and he was getting into 62 or so.

23:11.478 --> 23:17.908
And so there was a change at the president's level.

23:17.888 --> 23:23.234
I'm really trying to think of exactly the sequence of presidents at that time.

23:26.177 --> 23:41.793
There was more than one in a relatively short period, but Kim Gilchrist was president, and Dean Bolton served for a time as president, and then Tom Harrington.

23:44.216 --> 23:46.478
This would have been in the 1950s.

23:46.458 --> 23:54.888
But basically, you saw sort of a shift from agriculture being the dominant school to engineering.

23:54.908 --> 23:56.090
To engineering.

23:56.110 --> 24:11.588
Now, for you as a bright young man in junior and senior high, what wartime events overseas touched your mind and or your heart?

24:13.053 --> 24:24.343
In Pearl Harbor, you asked, what are some other events that you and your friends talked about a lot and you remember where you were when you heard the news?

24:26.705 --> 24:42.638
Well, of course, D-Day, and I may be thinking of it in retrospect more than anything, but that would have been sort of, to me, the most pivotal day in the war.

24:44.390 --> 24:47.536
I, of course, remember the surrender of the Japanese.

24:47.836 --> 24:49.479
What about the death of the president?

24:50.721 --> 24:51.823
Did that one?

24:52.164 --> 24:54.688
Yes, it very much did, yes.

24:54.749 --> 25:00.559
We had a high school party scheduled.

25:01.602 --> 25:04.347
occurring at the time of his death.

25:04.487 --> 25:08.393
And I think I was told about it at the time of the party, actually.

25:09.295 --> 25:22.918
And yes, that was a very sobering event because for people my age, he had been the president of the United States as long as we could remember, you know.

25:22.898 --> 25:28.812
I was at junior high football practice in the shower.

25:28.832 --> 25:32.020
And a young man stuck his head in the door and giggled.

25:33.323 --> 25:35.027
And we all said, hey, that's not funny.

25:35.067 --> 25:35.929
Don't be joking about that.

25:35.950 --> 25:36.992
And he said, no, that's true.

25:37.495 --> 25:41.542
When I got home, I realized I put on my clothes without drying off.

25:42.784 --> 25:47.011
And on the way home, we chatted about how do we get another president?

25:47.091 --> 25:51.198
Since he's been president forever, how can we get another one?

25:51.219 --> 25:52.180
And who will it be?

25:56.488 --> 25:59.593
Now, President Roosevelt had been here once, hadn't he, to visit?

25:59.613 --> 26:00.174
That's correct.

26:00.194 --> 26:01.837
Do you remember that visit?

26:02.097 --> 26:03.199
Yes.

26:03.179 --> 26:10.249
It was 1937, and I remember it without seeing him very well.

26:10.369 --> 26:16.498
I was in the hospital and recovering from pneumonia, and I very much wanted to see the president.

26:17.679 --> 26:26.031
I was not allowed to, so my mother gave me an Azalea, and I thought that was the worst trade-off.

26:26.011 --> 26:29.859
I mean, for not seeing the President.

26:30.521 --> 26:43.750
But the story that Knox Walker has told, one of our neighborhood boys, who later was a member of the entomology department at Anne Hill.

26:43.730 --> 26:56.878
He mentioned that Mother had left instructions with Ruby about how Wally was supposed to be attired for the occasion.

26:57.955 --> 27:01.199
And then she went to the hospital to see me.

27:01.880 --> 27:10.130
And so Wiley left with his white linen suit on, but he neglected to put his shoes on.

27:11.772 --> 27:20.183
And so Knox tells the story of that as the president's car apparently rounded

27:20.163 --> 27:31.173
turn in the track inside the stadium that Wiley ran forward, barefooted, and hopped up on the running board and, like says, shook hands with the press.

27:31.193 --> 27:39.480
And I'm not so sure that was the case, but with his linen suit and bare feet.

27:40.261 --> 27:41.242
It was a different era.

27:41.582 --> 27:42.003
That's right.

27:42.023 --> 27:42.663
A different era.

27:43.224 --> 27:44.345
All right.

27:44.365 --> 27:50.170
The war is over and you enter school in the summer or fall of 46?

27:50.150 --> 27:53.020
I entered it in the fall of 46.

27:54.565 --> 27:58.779
Was there ever any choice in your mind about where you would go to college?

27:59.542 --> 27:59.923
No.

28:00.629 --> 28:03.794
It wasn't really even considered, you know.

28:03.854 --> 28:06.979
It wasn't that you had to go to A&M.

28:06.999 --> 28:09.603
It's just that you just went to A&M, you know.

28:09.683 --> 28:17.876
There was no question about it, you know, and no heart-rending decision or worry about it or anything.

28:18.578 --> 28:21.001
It was just a... Where did you live your freshman year?

28:21.362 --> 28:23.245
I lived in dormitory two.

28:24.220 --> 28:25.804
What outfit?

28:26.064 --> 28:28.730
F battery.

28:30.434 --> 28:39.715
Dormitory 2 was about 50 yards from the site where the building was that I attended first grade.

28:39.695 --> 28:58.335
But my room was, I believe, 222 or 221, and it happened to be across from the CQ room, which was sort of where the cadet officer on duty was located on weekends and so forth.

28:58.395 --> 29:04.622
And I can remember, as a freshman, we were allowed out Saturday after classes were over.

29:05.716 --> 29:07.078
but had to come in that evening.

29:07.159 --> 29:12.668
And so I would come in and usually there was a poker game going on in the secure room.

29:12.688 --> 29:16.696
And usually later in the evening, a freshman would be hauled in there.

29:18.078 --> 29:23.708
So I would sort of sneak into my room as quietly as possible.

29:23.688 --> 29:38.356
And then I would open the closet door and get behind my duffel bag and sort of leave about a half an inch or less crack in the door so I'd have a little oxygen to see what was happening.

29:38.396 --> 29:42.203
That way, if they opened the door, they didn't see a freshman in the room.

29:44.748 --> 29:52.053
And I'd do that till about midnight, and then by that time, things had slowed down, so you'd go to bed then.

29:52.334 --> 29:55.264
Was there anything about the routine

29:55.919 --> 30:06.448
of the life of a fish in 46 that surprised you, or did you have a fairly accurate understanding of what life of a freshman would be?

30:06.468 --> 30:12.374
I don't know that I really understood totally what life as a freshman would be, because you had to experience it to really understand.

30:12.434 --> 30:20.281
But I did know that more or less, sort of in general, what to expect a little bit, yeah.

30:20.301 --> 30:22.563
And at that point, what was your academic goal?

30:23.464 --> 30:24.565
I was a pre-med student.

30:25.165 --> 30:25.926
So you?

30:25.906 --> 30:27.782
Where did that ambition come from?

30:28.842 --> 30:29.943
You know, I really don't know.

30:30.544 --> 30:32.846
I decided I wanted to be a physician when I was 16.

30:33.988 --> 30:40.134
And actually, what I had first thought about being a veterinarian, Dad's brother, younger brother, was a veterinarian.

30:40.214 --> 30:41.736
I liked him.

30:41.756 --> 30:47.422
And then I realized that I didn't know anything about animals or agriculture or anything of that sort.

30:47.502 --> 30:54.269
So it sort of evolved into being a human doctor instead of a veterinarian.

30:54.850 --> 30:57.533
At that point, what did you think

30:57.513 --> 31:02.881
it took to get into medical school in terms of grades and achievement level?

31:04.103 --> 31:15.821
When I was 16, I don't know that I thought about it so much in high school, but obviously when I reached college, it was very apparent that you had to do well academically.

31:16.262 --> 31:23.233
And I actually was a distinguished student my first semester, which in the Cadet Corps was something.
