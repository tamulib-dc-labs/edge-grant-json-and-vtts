00:01.853 --> 00:03.976
The Galveston storm was when? In 1900. Early 
September 1900. Was it a hurricane? Yeah, it was

00:12.609 --> 00:17.176
what we call a hurricane. It was what we call a 
hurricane now. And it was awful bad. And there also

00:25.249 --> 00:27.372
had been... a big storm and the Rattus River 
overflowed and that was bad. And all the way around

00:35.168 --> 00:37.251
they just caught it. Same year? Well, not exactly 
the same year, but it was close to together. And

00:44.820 --> 00:57.696
they

00:44.820 --> 00:57.696
just didn't know what to do and so they just moved 
off and left the whole thing. Did they lose all

00:58.250 --> 00:59.993
their property? Yes, it was finally sold. I don't 
know how much. And that is the money that... and we

01:05.742 --> 01:23.650
then spent a little money on a farm that's now 
called Mine at... Thornton?

01:23.866 --> 01:30.374
Now, is there anything I haven't brought out that 
you would like for me to mention this afternoon?

01:30.394 --> 01:31.055
Oh, no. I can't think of anything right now. How old 
were you? Do you remember anything about the

01:35.000 --> 01:37.384
storm? Do I remember the storm? Yes, I remember it. 
I remember how the wind blew. Did it flood? Oh, yes.

01:45.074 --> 01:45.915
The seawall? The water came in the house, and 
everything, and the rain blew. I remember when the

01:50.440 --> 01:53.164
house blew. It was a two-story block. And I 
remember when it blew off the blocks, you know.

02:01.963 --> 02:03.805
Nobody in the family was killed, were they? Oh, no. 
None of us were hurt. That's a miracle. None of us

02:07.431 --> 02:10.895
were hurt, but it blew all night. And the next day, 
it was just as fire and calm as it could be. That

02:17.284 --> 02:20.389
storm had lasted all night. But the next day, it 
was... just as far as could be. And so, I believe, if

02:27.879 --> 02:42.534
there's anything else you want to... And so we left 
there, and oh, we got malaria, you know, from other

02:27.879 --> 02:42.534
mosquitoes. How'd you get rid of that? Oh, well, we 
didn't, and it's finally cost our

02:44.896 --> 02:52.564
lives. He lived a few, well, two or three years. But 
he died of what a doctor told me. We called it black

03:01.341 --> 03:04.485
jaundice. Somebody was interviewing me about 
some insurance. And I said, how did... Mama, of

03:07.669 --> 03:11.654
course, was living with him. How did our father 
die? And I said, well, they said he had black

03:13.776 --> 03:16.660
jaundice. And he says, honey, do you know what 
black jaundice is? And I says, no. Of course, I

03:20.304 --> 03:22.787
remember him. I was nine years old. I remember how 
he was affected. Their kidneys turned to blood.

03:30.711 --> 03:36.899
And I remember seeing him carry out those hot jars 
of bloody water. And he lived about a week. And he

03:40.563 --> 03:41.925
said it was acute. This doctor told me, it was at 
March, this doctor told me that. He's dead now.

03:48.693 --> 03:50.015
It's one that Hegg called. You know, Hegg had a 
sister named... What was Ms. Collins' name? Well,

03:56.525 --> 04:01.609
anyway, Dr. Collins' wife was Peg's sister. And it 
was he that was talking to me about the insurance.

04:08.716 --> 04:11.819
And he said it was a cuticle area that he died on. I 
said, well, that was where? He says, you didn't

04:13.921 --> 04:17.245
develop it there in this country. I said, oh, no, we 
got it down there on the coast. When did you move the

04:20.408 --> 04:22.710
car from down there? from Angleton. We came to, 
near Cossie, and you know, Cossie's not far from

04:25.730 --> 04:34.003
Thornton. And there we stayed until, well, we came 
to Thornton. And,

04:43.197 --> 04:51.229
oh,

04:43.197 --> 04:51.229
I'm so, We jumped off one thing onto another. We 
were talking about his death, you know. He died at

05:01.416 --> 05:03.299
52, you see. He was an old man when he died. And Clem 
looks more like him than any child he had. Tell me

05:13.657 --> 05:14.839
about your school. Where did y'all go to school 
over there? I hadn't started school very big then.

05:24.649 --> 05:33.560
We were on the way out in the country near, well we 
were at what near the school was, Eureka, between

05:24.649 --> 05:33.560
Cossie and Todd. And Clem and Roy went to school. 
Bird and Albert were high school age then. And Clem

05:42.853 --> 05:46.598
and Roy went to school at Eureka. It's about midway 
between them. It's up there now, isn't it? Yes, it

05:53.486 --> 05:54.507
is. They don't have a school there anymore. I think 
the schoolhouse may be there. I don't know whether

05:59.151 --> 06:02.154
it's a community house or not. It was a school there 
for many years. They had a very good little country

06:05.297 --> 06:08.259
school. And when I started to school, I went there 
to school.

06:15.546 --> 06:17.528
But we didn't go along. We later moved up to 
Thornton, near Thornton. And there we went to our

06:23.321 --> 06:31.993
sister Dorcas taught this country school near 
Thornton. It was called Mill Creek. And there they

06:36.099 --> 06:38.763
went to school. And we all did. And she taught that 
year. Maybe she taught two years. I don't know.

06:47.798 --> 07:05.279
Anyway, then

06:47.798 --> 07:05.279
the next school we went to was the Thornton School. 
We have a picture of Clem's class in the Thornton

07:05.639 --> 07:14.750
School. How old was he then? Well, he looked grown, 
but of course he wasn't any older than the children

07:18.275 --> 07:24.624
in the class all looked. And there were children, 
well, you didn't know, but your mother and daddy,

07:24.644 --> 07:32.436
your mother, grandmother did. There was, oh, 
there was 10 or 12 of them. And their professor, and

07:37.644 --> 07:48.079
the professor went from there to, he was a good 
teacher, went from there to Commerce, Texas to

07:37.644 --> 07:48.079
teach a little It wasn't a summer school, but he 
went there to teach. And he lived there a few years.

07:55.534 --> 07:56.495
They just had one teacher? In high school. Just one 
teacher in high school. And I was down in the

08:03.483 --> 08:06.907
grades. And Roy was down, he was ahead of me, of 
course. And so we have that picture. And of those

08:14.717 --> 08:17.560
people in that picture, that are living now, Clem 
is just about the only one that's left. Dr. Kidd,

08:25.551 --> 08:28.174
Earl Kidd, made a dentist. And he's been dead some 
time. His wife lives in Dalton. And now I'm just

08:33.298 --> 08:35.580
talking about the picture. I don't know that you 
were even there. Yeah, I might. And then so many of

08:38.623 --> 08:46.770
those folks. And Walter Sparks lived there, and he 
lived in Rosebeck, and he has died. They're just

08:56.135 --> 08:58.899
about all dead with them. How long did y'all go to 
school there? Well, I went to school there off and

09:01.844 --> 09:10.298
on, practically all of my schooling, and I 
graduated from that school. We didn't have them.

09:11.945 --> 09:14.208
10 grades then. And I graduated from that school 
when I was about 17. And of course Clem and Roy both

09:24.179 --> 09:27.723
quit to work. Clem was a good student. I don't know 
about Roy, but I remember that.

09:40.632 --> 09:41.813
They quit the farm? Yes, to work on the farm. You 
see, Albert left home. Your granddaddy, Taylor,

09:47.478 --> 09:53.484
he was gone. There wasn't much for folks on the farm 
then.

10:05.275 --> 10:09.559
And so they quit the work.

10:10.889 --> 10:13.311
So then I kept on going. I went to school, and I drove 
a horse. Drove a horse and buggy, or did you ride

10:16.875 --> 10:20.479
just the horse? Horse and buggy. I went on the 
horse, and I drove a horse for a mile. And it would be

10:26.505 --> 10:29.788
about sunset when I get home in the afternoon. How 
far were you from school? How far was it? It was

10:32.871 --> 10:34.153
about three miles. But I just fooled along. I 
didn't run in any hurry. Mom could see me coming

10:40.623 --> 10:44.948
away in the distance. Of course, that road is 
closed now that I came. How many kids were in the

10:48.632 --> 10:51.656
school when you were in there? How many kids were 
around that school? Oh, I guess it was maybe 200 or

10:55.400 --> 10:59.305
300. That's a lot. Well, it was a lot of kids. It 
wasn't all bigger than the town was. We thought it

11:05.672 --> 11:08.335
was bigger then, though, than it is right now. I've 
heard Martin was a bigger guy then, too. Yes, my

11:11.367 --> 11:14.710
father was. And anything else you want to know? 
Well, where did Ampop go then? Well, where did he go

11:19.415 --> 11:25.402
to school? I don't know. What did he do when he quit 
school? He went to school, I reckon, in Angleton.

11:29.046 --> 11:31.789
He and Albert went to school in Angleton, I guess. 
But they came with us when we left Angleton. See, we

11:37.114 --> 11:38.676
came by wagon. and brought the cows and the horses 
and everything. When did he get married? In what

11:47.734 --> 11:49.476
year? Well, Clem will probably know that. I don't 
know. I

11:52.800 --> 11:57.967
was sure it was 1905.

12:00.210 --> 12:06.638
He said it was either Christmas Day or Christmas 
Eve, whichever it was, but it was 1905. Did he just

12:06.905 --> 12:09.709
move to Grosbeck and Big Hill then? No. See, we all 
lived near Thornton, as near Thornton as anywhere

12:11.171 --> 12:16.017
else. It was our town. And we lived off in the 
pasture. And he had rented him a place for them to go

12:21.124 --> 12:32.619
to live over two or three miles to the west of us over 
in the neighborhood of, oh, well, I don't know who

12:21.124 --> 12:32.619
lives over there now. But anyway, it wasn't too far 
away from where we lived.

12:43.929 --> 12:51.745
And so they got busy and mama gave them things and 
your grandmother, your Your grandmother's folks

12:52.079 --> 13:03.470
gave them things, and they had, and he, Byrne had 
made a good crowd that year, and he bought them some

12:52.079 --> 13:03.470
furniture. And they fixed it. And a man, some folks 
named Watson owned the place where, I don't know

13:04.811 --> 13:19.025
who owns it now, but somebody named Watson owned 
it, and he was a very good father. Well, did you go to

13:19.045 --> 13:21.107
college? Well, yes. And then I studied and I went to 
Trinity University. Where was that? It was in

13:33.907 --> 13:37.855
Waxahachie at that time. It's been in San Antonio 
now for a number of years. But that's where I went.

13:43.261 --> 13:49.048
And then later, when I got my certificate, we 
didn't have to have a degree then to start. We just

13:49.409 --> 13:51.872
had to have a certificate. I kept on working, you 
know, and going to school, teaching and

13:52.252 --> 13:59.101
everything. Did you teach all grades? No, I never 
did teach a whole big grade. My first school was

14:06.370 --> 14:09.133
at... an orphanage near Itasca, Texas. And that 
was in 1918. And Clem was in the Army. You see, he had

14:25.615 --> 14:29.200
to go to the World War I. And that year, the old 
schools were terribly torn up at that time, of

14:31.182 --> 14:39.492
course, due to the due to the war and everything.

14:46.457 --> 14:54.365
And then later on I went to Baylor a lot and studied a 
lot one way or another. Now anything else you want

14:55.866 --> 14:57.948
to know? Well...

14:58.949 --> 15:08.297
Uncle Clem, can you tell me, you remember much 
about World War I and how you Were

15:09.155 --> 15:14.804
you drafted? Oh, yes, yes. You were? Did they send 
notices like they do now? When was that? Do you

15:24.338 --> 15:25.099
remember what year? I guess it was June. June 14th 
was when I went. Well, where did you go first?

15:34.334 --> 15:35.475
College Station. Really? College Station. Was

15:37.758 --> 15:43.827
it on the campus? Was it at

15:44.748 --> 15:59.250
College

15:44.748 --> 15:59.250
Station?

16:01.734 --> 16:02.835
Where'd you go from there? Did you get basic 
training there? I was just a young man. Went from

16:08.139 --> 16:14.065
Atlanta, Camp Jordan, St. John's, to 
Jacksonville, Florida. Jacksonville? Did you go

16:15.786 --> 16:20.550
overseas from there? Yes. Where'd you go? I went 
overseas from Newport, New Virginia, you see.

16:26.816 --> 16:31.800
They didn't have any place there to load any boats. 
They took us to Newport, New Virginia. Uh-huh.

16:37.740 --> 16:38.721
What were your duties? I mean, what did you have to 
do? Uh-uh.

16:46.711 --> 16:47.272
What's that?

16:50.436 --> 16:52.899
Everything would destroy me. I heard you went to 
France. How long were you over there? About six

17:02.250 --> 17:02.811
months. Did you see any combat?

17:08.971 --> 17:09.231
No. We're in France. We're in France. Where

17:12.675 --> 17:24.426
are you?

17:31.313 --> 17:32.354
How long were you over there? Six months? We 
discharged after the war? No, after

17:41.005 --> 17:47.698
the war.
