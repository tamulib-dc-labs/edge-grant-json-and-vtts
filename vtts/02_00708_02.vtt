WEBVTT

00:04.317 --> 00:07.862
And you were talking about research work that 
you've been involved in. Yeah. Well, as I

00:09.283 --> 00:15.371
mentioned, my formal funding for the research 
stopped about 71 or 72. Meantime, I got in to a

00:17.494 --> 00:25.905
limited extent on some of the problems that were 
beginning then to appear in the offshore area oil

00:17.494 --> 00:25.905
spills. Worked a little bit on that. So as I said, I 
continued on working and still am working in the

00:30.625 --> 00:39.594
area of shells, even though I don't have any funds 
from government sources or from business

00:30.625 --> 00:39.594
sources. But the problems are basic, and the 
problems are important. And I've got doctorate

00:43.597 --> 00:48.342
students doing dissertations in that area. The 
other area that is of more direct applied interest

00:48.382 --> 00:56.270
and therefore is more fundable is the area in 
offshore technology. And I've become involved

00:56.310 --> 00:58.692
with the ASME in about 1975, and about the same time 
I took a visiting professorship at Exxon

01:00.173 --> 01:17.450
Production Research in order to get more, this is 
down in Houston, to become more familiar with the

01:00.173 --> 01:17.450
problems of the offshore area. So the other part of 
my research endeavors are in the offshore

01:18.150 --> 01:30.062
technology area, primarily with the riser, which 
is the great conduit that goes from the drilling

01:18.150 --> 01:30.062
vessel or the production bottom of the sea. And it 
isn't a shift away from my basic area, it's a

01:32.551 --> 01:52.371
compliment to, it's a very applied area, it gives 
me a chance to go out and especially in the state of

01:32.551 --> 01:52.371
Texas to meet with people who are working in that 
area and especially our own graduates, who often

01:32.551 --> 01:52.371
are hired by companies that have a direct interest 
in that area.

01:55.810 --> 02:01.977
Since you've been involved in engineering, have 
the job opportunities for engineers always been

01:55.810 --> 02:01.977
as good as they are today? No. No, in fact, the 
market has fluctuated. When I came in 63, the space

02:08.485 --> 02:13.171
program was just beginning to build up, build 
itself up. It actually started around 1960. From

02:17.116 --> 02:23.083
about 1960 or approximately from the time the 
first Sputnik went up to about 1970, It was similar

02:23.722 --> 02:30.172
to what we have here, but even more so because the 
emphasis then was on graduate degrees. People

02:30.292 --> 02:43.291
were hiring PhDs, not so much for the specialized 
information, but rather because government

02:30.292 --> 02:43.291
contracts allocated a certain amount of cost 
funds to the degree. And so people would hire a PhD

02:44.073 --> 02:52.345
simply to get his name down on the contract and 
therefore get a higher return on their

02:44.073 --> 02:52.345
investment. In 1970, or in some areas 1969, the 
market crashed from approximately 69 to about 73

02:52.848 --> 03:01.781
or 74. PhDs, whether in engineering or in science, 
were literally driving taxi cabs. There was no

03:08.291 --> 03:10.795
market for them. About that time, I had four PhDs 
coming out, and I was quite concerned about them

03:10.815 --> 03:18.226
finding employment. When I would go to the 
companies, and plead for them, telling them that

03:20.168 --> 03:25.640
these men would be satisfied with bachelor's 
level salaries. And of course, they'd be more

03:27.223 --> 03:32.615
qualified than any bachelor's degree, because 
they had a bachelor's plus a master's degree. The

03:33.096 --> 03:39.831
companies were reluctant to take them, saying 
that as soon as the market would open up, these

03:33.096 --> 03:39.831
people would leave, and they would lose so much 
trained talent. Well, I tried to convince him at

03:40.688 --> 03:48.116
that time that a PhD, in spite of his area of 
specialization, was actually a fairly broadly

03:40.688 --> 03:48.116
educated individual. He had everything a 
bachelor's and a master's student had so far as

03:48.136 --> 03:53.963
spectrum of courses are concerned. But he also had 
the maturity that comes about in doing a research

03:54.483 --> 04:09.700
project, and that is defining the project by 
itself, going out and digging out the relevant

03:54.483 --> 04:09.700
material, putting it together, writing a report 
vis-a-vis the dissertation, and defending it.

04:10.304 --> 04:20.117
And that itself, regardless of what the content of 
the dissertation would be, was an important

04:10.304 --> 04:20.117
element that would be good training for any area 
that this individual would come in. And I tried to

04:20.177 --> 04:26.846
convince industry to hire PhDs as generalists 
rather than as specialists. Well, it was

04:26.866 --> 04:32.774
rejected, but interestingly enough, now it has 
changed around, and that's exactly what industry

04:26.866 --> 04:32.774
is doing. They hire a PhD not because he did 
research work in some esoteric, sophisticated

04:32.814 --> 04:39.163
area, but rather because he has this technical 
maturity and this experience. And so to answer

04:46.904 --> 04:57.596
your question, from 63 to 72, or 72 perhaps is the 
depth of it, was a pretty black area for any

04:46.904 --> 04:57.596
graduate students. And I think we may be seeing 
some of the effects even now where we have

04:57.636 --> 05:04.324
difficulty attracting graduate students. You 
know, there's an inertia in everything, and I

05:04.675 --> 05:10.463
think there's also an inertia in the educational 
process. From 63 to 72, we couldn't get anyone to go

05:11.444 --> 05:16.612
for a doctorate because they said there were no 
jobs available. Now, we have jobs available, but

05:17.633 --> 05:25.384
nobody's willing to do it because they say the 
compensation is not that much more than that of a

05:17.633 --> 05:25.384
bachelor's degree.

05:31.777 --> 05:39.465
Have you noticed any changes in the quality of the 
students at Texas A&M in the 18 years that you've

05:31.777 --> 05:39.465
been here? Not really. Though, when I talk with 
some of my colleagues, I seem to be a minority. I

05:46.212 --> 05:46.852
really don't. I would think, if anything, the 
students coming in now would be probably better

05:47.153 --> 05:57.003
prepared, more competent, at least 
intellectually, to handle the material. The

05:58.625 --> 06:01.007
motivation remains pretty much the same. When I 
came in 63, the one thing that I did find is a very

06:02.017 --> 06:06.863
highly motivated student. The idea of Texas A&M 
being a poor boy's school was perhaps closer to the

06:08.065 --> 06:14.193
truth then than it is now. I felt a certain kinship 
because I could empathize with people, many

06:14.213 --> 06:26.709
students coming in from the farms and they 
themselves going through the same experience

06:14.213 --> 06:26.709
that I had gone through. This was the first time for 
anybody in their family to have ever gone so far. I

06:32.695 --> 06:34.177
don't think that's true anymore. I think by and 
large the white community in the United States is

06:34.217 --> 06:44.930
generally of middle class stature and most of the 
students that we see coming through A&M are

06:34.217 --> 06:44.930
probably of middle class. The number of truly 
so-called poor boys quotation marks is probably

06:45.991 --> 06:54.822
much, much less now than it had been in the past. No, 
I really don't see any change in the quality of the

06:55.139 --> 06:58.422
student. I think certainly the times have 
changed, and so you see the outward

06:58.482 --> 07:05.089
manifestations being somewhat different. But 
basically, the students are the same. For the

07:07.751 --> 07:15.879
individual who goes to the engineering college, 
for him to go there means that he has to have a

07:07.751 --> 07:15.879
certain purpose in mind. He isn't floundering, as 
many of the students are, wondering what they

07:15.939 --> 07:19.242
want. He's pretty much determined that. And 
because he has, and because engineering is a

07:21.363 --> 07:30.634
fairly structured program, once he gets in, 
things are pretty much determined for him, what

07:21.363 --> 07:30.634
he's going to take and where he's going to go. And 
again, that same motivation continues to exist.

07:36.901 --> 07:42.628
Do you find that students today have any 
weaknesses that they didn't have 18 years ago?

07:43.132 --> 07:46.096
maybe in composition or something at this time? 
No. And incidentally, composition has always

07:46.977 --> 07:52.724
been a weak point of the College of Engineering, 
even going back to my Rensselaer days. It was

07:53.425 --> 07:57.290
almost axiomatic that if you were an engineer, you 
were going to murder the language. And almost also

07:58.231 --> 08:03.798
axiomatic that if you were an engineer, you hated 
the humanities subjects. You couldn't

08:03.818 --> 08:08.224
understand why they made you take English and why 
they made you take history. So in that respect,

08:08.244 --> 08:11.788
things still are pretty much the same.

08:15.937 --> 08:29.878
Possibly, the student, when I first came, may have 
been a little bit more mature, not because of

08:15.937 --> 08:29.878
anything other than the economic status of the 
student. Poverty tends to mature you much quicker

08:29.898 --> 08:33.043
than middle class.

08:35.987 --> 08:39.092
Well, mostly do you handle graduate students or 
undergraduates? Graduates, well, I probably was

08:40.000 --> 08:45.708
more deeply involved with graduate students than 
I had been with undergraduate students. But since

08:45.728 --> 08:49.975
I had come to A&M, I'd always wanted to teach at 
least one undergraduate course. I never wanted to

08:50.015 --> 08:52.799
lose contact with the undergraduate students. 
A&M's strength, traditionally and in the future,

08:53.920 --> 08:59.709
will still lie with its undergraduate program. 
And that's true of any state institution. The

09:02.853 --> 09:08.742
state legislature mandates that you educate 
their young at the baccalaureate level. And I

09:10.105 --> 09:15.073
never want to lose sight of that because that is the 
uniqueness of this country. Unlike European

09:15.894 --> 09:23.947
countries, we perhaps don't require as strict an 
entrance requirement as perhaps Germany or

09:15.894 --> 09:23.947
England would be. The quality of the individual, 
the quality of the education perhaps isn't as

09:25.269 --> 09:36.788
demanding as a general rule on the baccalaureate 
level as it would be in any of the other countries.

09:37.004 --> 09:39.408
But I believe in the supremacy of numbers. I 
believe in having a large media, which may be lower

09:40.049 --> 09:48.523
than the peaks of a small elite group. And so I'm 
very much committed to, if you want, an

09:48.543 --> 09:54.072
egalitarian concept of education.

09:57.017 --> 10:00.463
How have the interests of women in engineering 
affected the college? Well, for one thing, they

10:02.519 --> 10:07.125
gave the professors, finally, parity with their 
humanity peers. It used to be that if you had a girl

10:08.566 --> 10:13.492
in engineering, you'd run around the hall and say, 
hey, guess what I got? And it was the uniqueness of

10:13.733 --> 10:16.216
the being. Now it's almost old hat. After all, 
remember, faculty is as human as the students. All

10:21.442 --> 10:22.763
we are just a little bit older. I don't think it has 
directly affected engineering. I'm glad to see

10:29.512 --> 10:30.653
it. because I think engineering has a great deal to 
offer for many of the young girls. But there was

10:35.792 --> 10:48.909
also an image of engineering that tended to keep 
girls away in the past, namely as being a

10:35.792 --> 10:48.909
male-dominated, rather rude, crude type of 
profession. And that, by and large, has changed.

10:51.752 --> 11:00.623
In actuality, it never was what people thought it 
to be, namely elaborate steamfitters or

10:51.752 --> 11:00.623
weightlifters. It always was primarily an 
analytical group. What we're finding now is that

11:06.777 --> 11:23.054
many students, and this perhaps is even true of the 
girls, are going into engineering not because

11:06.777 --> 11:23.054
they want to practice engineering as a 
profession, but rather what they want is the

11:06.777 --> 11:23.054
discipline, the self-discipline. And the study 
happens that engineering enforces on all of its

11:24.616 --> 11:30.222
students. Many of these people, upon graduation, 
will go on into law, go into business, get their

11:30.640 --> 11:46.173
MBAs, master of business administration, go into 
medicine, or may go into a completely alien field

11:30.640 --> 11:46.173
that I can't even conceive of. The sense that I have 
among many students is that in engineering you

11:47.695 --> 11:59.905
still have to practice good study habits because 
your coursework is so structured that missing one

11:47.695 --> 11:59.905
week's lecture actually means you miss about 
three weeks the week that you didn't study the week

12:01.167 --> 12:30.702
that you're getting now and the additional week of 
the new material coming into being plus the fact

12:01.167 --> 12:30.702
that in a modern society such as we we are a 
technologically based society and to understand

12:01.167 --> 12:30.702
and to be able to cope with that society means that 
at least you have to understand the language of

12:01.167 --> 12:30.702
technology and some of the concepts of technology 
and many people are taking engineering almost as a

12:31.880 --> 12:47.616
form of liberal arts, or almost as an alternative 
to liberal arts, simply to be able to understand

12:31.880 --> 12:47.616
what the limitations and the vocabularies of 
technology are.

12:47.636 --> 12:56.125
Do you have any idea of why relatively few blacks 
enroll in engineering programs?

12:56.525 --> 12:59.288
Yes, and it's a sad comment. For one thing, the very 
capable blacks, the ones who could make it in

13:01.158 --> 13:08.888
engineering without any problem, would probably 
not go into engineering. They'd probably go into

13:09.068 --> 13:12.272
law programs or into medical programs. In the one 
case, by going into law, you find that they can get

13:13.393 --> 13:25.529
into politics, and with medicine, obviously, not 
only the prestige factor, but also the monetary

13:13.393 --> 13:25.529
return. The other blacks are keeping away from 
engineering because of the demands that are being

13:27.382 --> 13:30.565
made. Engineering has never made any concession 
to poor preparation on the part of the student. A

13:38.474 --> 13:47.243
black coming from a black ghetto school would have 
difficulty surviving in an engineering program

13:38.474 --> 13:47.243
unless he took a great deal of remedial courses. 
And in fact, they've tried this at some other

13:48.044 --> 13:50.486
schools. The net result is that many of the blacks 
looking at this situation and looking at the

13:54.888 --> 14:21.435
alternatives and looking at the additional time 
that would be required for him to get his degree,

13:54.888 --> 14:21.435
usually about a year to a year and a half, and that 
would be taken up in remedial courses, finds that

13:54.888 --> 14:21.435
he's far better off going into some other area 
where the remedial courses perhaps aren't

13:54.888 --> 14:21.435
necessary or perhaps the curricula is much more 
flexible, meaning perhaps his lack of

13:54.888 --> 14:21.435
preparation. This is, well, it's not quite the 
same, but it's similar to a program that we had when

14:22.765 --> 14:29.176
women were first introduced into engineering. 
One of the comments was, why aren't we attracting

14:30.057 --> 14:32.461
more women? And the comment again was made that 
those who could compete in engineering and had the

14:33.423 --> 14:43.660
ability to do so would probably choose a pre-med or 
pre-law program. And it's only recently that we

14:44.399 --> 14:49.246
begin seeing the numbers in engineering that we 
had hoped to see. And part of it was just the

14:49.867 --> 14:56.015
realization that in engineering they could still 
do the pre the law or the medicine. But what

14:56.496 --> 15:00.101
engineering did was give them some of the side 
benefits. The black is not in that position

15:01.503 --> 15:11.537
because usually the woman in engineering, the 
average woman who comes in, comes in from middle

15:01.503 --> 15:11.537
class background and usually has a fairly good 
background from her high school. Is this a

15:13.002 --> 15:16.947
nationwide phenomenon, or is this peculiar to 
Texas A&M? No, I think it's nationwide.

15:21.614 --> 15:29.164
Do you have any indication how the engineering 
program at Texas A&M compares with programs at

15:21.614 --> 15:29.164
other universities across the country? I think 
it's excellent. I think it always has been

15:30.346 --> 15:31.828
excellent. I don't think A&M has to apologize to 
anyone for any of its engineering programs. On the

15:38.277 --> 15:42.823
baccalaureate level, which is where our strength 
had laid for years and years, We were a well-known

15:43.242 --> 15:45.086
institution. Our graduates were quite 
successful. Our graduates were in demand. And the

15:50.295 --> 15:52.299
institution was held in repute. So there's a 
curious thing. When I first came to A&M in 63, and I

15:58.251 --> 16:03.681
still see it in evidence, and I can't really 
understand it, When I applied throughout the

16:04.842 --> 16:12.830
country, I applied to a number of institutions 
that I was aware of, people or institutions that

16:04.842 --> 16:12.830
were known as engineering institutions. In the 
state of Texas, having come from the New York City

16:13.751 --> 16:26.704
area and then from Columbus area, the places that I 
was aware of were Rice University, SMU, Baylor,

16:13.751 --> 16:26.704
and Texas A&M. I never heard of the University of 
Texas. If I say this not in jest, I'm dead serious.

16:33.007 --> 16:37.092
And so when I came to A&M, the first thing that 
surprised me were the Aggie jokes. There were

16:37.932 --> 16:41.196
nothing more than the Pollock jokes or the Italian 
jokes or the black jokes. You thought A&M was the

16:41.276 --> 16:43.098
University of Texas? No, I didn't. I didn't really 
think anything about it. I didn't even know that

16:45.781 --> 16:48.925
the University of Texas existed. Just like 
there's no such thing as the University of

16:49.826 --> 16:52.569
Louisiana. Yeah, right. You know, it's the kind of 
thing that if you were to say what is known

17:00.850 --> 17:03.954
A&M would certainly be one of the standout 
institutions. The other institutions I knew

17:05.336 --> 17:09.242
about, St. Baylor simply because of the football 
season. I never was really that much of a sports

17:09.442 --> 17:11.565
fan. And SMU I knew about because I had a friend who 
was in the service who was a graduate of SMU. And of

17:17.073 --> 17:19.217
course, Rice was a well-known institution. And so 
when I came, I thought I came to an institution that

17:20.078 --> 17:27.248
was held in some sort of place of honor in the state 
of Texas. And then I find out this whole business of

17:29.707 --> 17:32.951
the competition between us and the University of 
Texas. But the thing that disturbed me is this

17:33.411 --> 17:45.105
inferiority complex that both the alumni and the 
faculty had toward themselves, always saying,

17:33.411 --> 17:45.105
how do we compare to the University of Texas? How do 
we compare to somewhere else? It's as if though

17:48.328 --> 17:58.380
somebody had programmed these people to make them 
feel that they were inferior, rather than just

17:48.328 --> 17:58.380
ignore anything and do that which they were well 
known for. And this business with the University

17:59.002 --> 18:01.927
of Texas infuriates me. University of Texas is a 
fine institution, but it is a university in the

18:01.967 --> 18:09.320
truest sense of the term. Its strengths lie not in 
engineering, but they lie in the humanities. And

18:14.530 --> 18:15.972
for that, it is well known. A&M shouldn't worry 
about what the University of Texas is, we

18:19.927 --> 18:25.276
shouldn't worry about competing with them 
because we can't. The charters are different for

18:25.497 --> 18:27.941
the two institutions. We're a land-grant school, 
they were not. We had a different role to fulfill

18:30.886 --> 18:33.330
than they. Why instead of looking toward them as 
the role model, which covertly we have done, why

18:34.292 --> 18:41.344
didn't we develop our own model? And this I could 
never understand. It still exists. It exists even

18:46.354 --> 18:47.396
today. The worst thing we could do is hire, on our 
faculty, University of Texas graduates. Because

18:53.605 --> 18:58.873
these people come in with an inbuilt bias against 
this institution. You know, this is thought of the

18:58.893 --> 19:00.495
pits. And that's the thing that drives me bananas. 
And there's no way I can fight it. It seems to be

19:04.902 --> 19:07.686
endemic to this area. But A&M has never had to 
apologize to anyone for this program. Do you think

19:12.080 --> 19:18.628
part of this inferiority complex that you're 
talking about could be because of the location

19:12.080 --> 19:18.628
away from the larger cities? No, not really, 
because there are too many other institutions in

19:19.269 --> 19:23.393
similar situations. Purdue is certainly way off 
the sticks and has never had to worry about it. I'm

19:27.338 --> 19:29.100
not sure where the problem lies. The problem may 
lie in that perhaps many of the original people who

19:29.140 --> 19:35.968
came to teach at A&M were products of the 
University of Texas, or it may be part of a cultural

19:36.185 --> 19:47.441
hang-up which still tended to look at engineering 
and agriculture as being really

19:36.185 --> 19:47.441
sub-professions. And to be in them meant that you 
really weren't performing, or you really weren't

19:48.203 --> 19:59.359
at the same level of sophistication as, say, your 
equivalents at the University of Texas. I'm not

19:59.519 --> 20:05.027
sure where, but I'm sure it's deep-seated in the 
roots of the history of the state of Texas. Do you

20:06.728 --> 20:08.751
ever regret coming to Texas A&M? No, I never did. 
Now, you understand that will vary. Everybody has

20:12.856 --> 20:16.441
these momentary regrets no matter what you do. By 
and large, no. I've enjoyed it myself. I've had a

20:20.687 --> 20:22.850
sense of fulfillment. I've had a reasonable sense 
of success. And I still have a sense of

20:28.018 --> 20:31.763
contributing and will continue to do so. You 
divide your time. equally between teaching and

20:33.762 --> 20:35.544
research? Pretty much so, yes. What's some of the 
research projects that you're handling now?

20:41.089 --> 20:45.753
Well, my research projects right now, of course, 
are truly doctoral students. I've had six PhDs in

20:45.833 --> 20:50.377
the last two years, and unfortunately they came in 
batches. And I've got three right now, but the

20:51.158 --> 21:01.407
research projects have to deal with laminated 
shell theory, the lamination mold failures,

20:51.158 --> 21:01.407
which is a unique mold failure when you have 
different materials bonded together and the

21:01.640 --> 21:07.755
bonding agent happens to be the weakest link in the 
chain. So these have got, in fact, one

21:07.775 --> 21:13.368
dissertation being finished on that and my own 
research in that area. And then the other two have

21:14.190 --> 21:16.656
to deal with the offshore area. One of them has to 
deal with the analysis of the riser joint, which is

21:20.354 --> 21:24.599
the pipe itself. The pipe is subjected to subsea 
loads. It has large values of displacement. It's

21:30.325 --> 21:32.828
dynamic rather than static. And the other has to 
deal with the mechanism which holds the pipe up and

21:32.848 --> 21:41.238
which is critical in providing the support for the 
riser system. It's called the riser tensioner and

21:41.298 --> 21:43.560
the slip joint. And so those are the areas that 
right now I'm working on. In the 18 years that

21:48.316 --> 21:58.610
you've been at Texas A&M, have you noticed any 
difference in state legislative funding through

21:48.316 --> 21:58.610
the years for engineering programs? Or has it been 
about the same throughout this period? No, it's

22:03.376 --> 22:05.058
probably increased. One of the concerns that I've 
always had, and one of the questions that I've had,

22:11.857 --> 22:28.473
with regard to funding is why, when the University 
of Texas and Texas A&M are of the same size, why has

22:11.857 --> 22:28.473
the University of Texas salaries, year by year, 
rank by rank, been $1,000 to $2,000 more than those

22:11.857 --> 22:28.473
of the A&M faculty? There's obviously a 
disparity. You know, they're on the same formula

22:31.015 --> 22:33.618
funding as we are. They're on the same permanent 
fund as we are. And yet there is a difference. And I

22:39.667 --> 22:50.178
sometimes wonder whether that difference is not 
manifest in either the ability of the

22:39.667 --> 22:50.178
administration presenting its case or in what 
sometimes is called creative administration.

22:51.179 --> 23:02.031
A&M perhaps is uniquely characterized in its 
administration mode as being scrupulously

22:51.179 --> 23:02.031
honest to the word and to the intent of the 
legislature. I have a suspicion that at the

23:02.892 --> 23:08.458
University of Texas and the University of 
Houston, they may be scrupulously honest to the

23:09.012 --> 23:13.278
word, but not necessarily to the intent. What they 
have is then what you call creative bookkeeping.

23:23.213 --> 23:24.856
Is your wife teaching here now? No. When we came to 
Texas, I wanted her to completely retire. I wanted

23:31.366 --> 23:36.994
her to be a homemaker, and wanted her to have the 
leisure to develop her own talents. And this is

23:37.767 --> 23:38.989
what she's done. She's been involved with various 
groups. She's put on seminars, book reviews,

23:42.695 --> 23:47.082
things of this sort. And so in that respect, I think 
she's contributed. Do you have children? None.

23:58.237 --> 24:04.663
Let me ask you something about foreign students, 
foreign students who are in the graduate program

23:58.237 --> 24:04.663
in engineering. There seems to be a relatively 
large number of these. Could you account for this?

24:09.166 --> 24:09.547
No. These are about, I would suspect, we're 
writing about 50-50, 50% foreign international

24:09.567 --> 24:22.038
students or international students for 50% 
American students. There's probably a number of

24:22.138 --> 24:25.501
reasons for it. I'm sure some of the international 
students coming over was a way of getting away from

24:30.721 --> 24:32.884
their country. In some other cases, where the 
students would come in for a bachelor's degree,

24:34.326 --> 24:42.959
they would stay on for their masters and doctors to 
delay going back to their own country. But I think

24:43.740 --> 24:55.176
by and large, the greatest number of students have 
come to this country and come to A&M, or for that

24:43.740 --> 24:55.176
matter, any other university, because the United 
States still is a leader in technology. and for

24:55.797 --> 25:01.445
them it meant getting the specialized 
information and education that they would need to

24:55.797 --> 25:01.445
go back.

25:05.571 --> 25:14.143
Do you find that these foreign students have any 
difficulty with the English language as

25:05.571 --> 25:14.143
affecting their academic skills? Oh yes, I'm sure 
of that. They vary. There's no way to make any

25:16.446 --> 25:19.029
generalization. Some come in with very, very poor 
skills. The university

25:26.257 --> 25:28.439
tries to screen them through the TOEFL scores. 
Spell that. T-O-E-F-L. It's an abbreviation, an

25:30.842 --> 25:42.713
acronym for Test on English, T-O-E-F-L, English 
Fluency Language or something of this sort. I

25:42.733 --> 25:44.675
don't know what it is. You have to have a certain 
TOEFL score before you're even admitted to A&M.

25:51.102 --> 25:56.247
And having been admitted, you may be asked to go to 
the English Language Institute. So there's a

25:56.530 --> 26:06.619
recognition on the part of the university that it 
would be unfair to bring a student in who might be

25:56.530 --> 26:06.619
academically well prepared, but yet still may 
fail because he can't handle the language. A lot

26:07.720 --> 26:10.423
depends on what country the student may have come 
from. Some countries, though they may have a

26:10.663 --> 26:22.054
parent

26:10.663 --> 26:22.054
language or a dominant language, will 
nevertheless have English as a secondary

26:10.663 --> 26:22.054
language. And these students are reasonably 
fluent in it. In other countries, English was

26:24.543 --> 26:34.621
completely learned within a three-month or a 
five-month crash course, and these students are

26:24.543 --> 26:34.621
going to have a difficult time. The thing that we 
must remember when we look at students such as this

26:34.641 --> 26:40.852
is to realize that most of these students are the 
cream of their country. They are extremely well

26:41.653 --> 26:43.857
qualified. Their problem is not in assimilating 
the material, it's in handling the language.

26:57.027 --> 26:57.948
Can we digress? Can I ask you something about how 
you feel about this situation facing Poland

26:58.289 --> 27:08.224
today, since you haven't got your parents from 
Poland? Well, a number of comments that I can make.

27:13.452 --> 27:16.617
Poles have unfortunately almost had a suicidal 
tendency. They haven't won a major war since

27:18.860 --> 27:21.484
17-something. They did remarkably well in 
defeat. I don't know what's going to happen. I do

27:26.034 --> 27:31.640
know this, that it's a very critical period for 
both Poland, for Russia, and for the eastern

27:26.034 --> 27:31.640
satellites. To put it into a certain, to a 
perspective, to understand what Russia's

27:33.842 --> 27:47.456
concerns would be, this would be akin to Mexico 
suddenly becoming Marxist and becoming a

27:33.842 --> 27:47.456
virulent communist state right on our border. And 
you can understand the concerns that we would have

27:48.637 --> 27:52.701
for Poland. Now, going for the free unions, now 
they're not switching from socialism to

27:53.356 --> 28:06.057
capitalism, but nevertheless they're breaking 
away from the traditional Soviet communist mode,

27:53.356 --> 28:06.057
would be very much akin to that. They're playing a 
dangerous game. My own feeling is that the

28:10.384 --> 28:16.815
government, which seems to be the adversary of the 
unions, is really working in collusion for it.

28:16.835 --> 28:17.676
It's an experiment. And I'm sure somewhere, 
someplace, there have been meetings or there are

28:18.483 --> 28:30.854
continuing meetings where representatives of 
the government, representatives of the church,

28:18.483 --> 28:30.854
and representatives of solidarity meet and plan 
out the latest scenario. You know, how far can they

28:31.495 --> 28:32.916
push? What should the government's response be to 
satisfy Moscow? But fundamentally, they want to

28:36.659 --> 28:40.163
see how much autonomy can they gain. And 
ultimately, as an absolute statement, I'm very

28:41.844 --> 28:48.490
much in agreement with it. I think, again, all 
countries, all people should have the freedom, a

28:49.128 --> 28:54.454
certain freedom of choice. For Russia, it 
represents a tremendous challenge, not only

28:55.535 --> 29:05.766
because Poland is on its borders, but because what 
happens in Poland is being very closely watched in

28:55.535 --> 29:05.766
other European satellites. And it's no great 
secret that the satellites are satellites not by

29:06.706 --> 29:14.815
their own volition, but because they had no 
choice. So Hungary, East Germany,

29:15.436 --> 29:23.305
Czechoslovakia, Poland are all there because 
they have to be. Given a spark, Russia feels that

29:23.325 --> 29:32.915
all of them would break away and they would have 
then a new Yugoslavia on their border. I think they

29:32.935 --> 29:34.317
may pull it off. Again, it's going to be sort of 
brinkmanship right up to the very end. Russia, I

29:40.564 --> 29:43.587
don't think, is going to intervene militarily. I 
think what it's going to do is use an economic

29:44.107 --> 29:48.273
weapon, and it's already threatened to do so. What 
it hopes to do is to literally starve and freeze the

29:49.654 --> 29:56.704
polls into submission by just refusing them any 
aid. And this is then where the free world's role

29:56.724 --> 29:59.788
comes in. And then again, what would be the Russian 
response if we started now bringing in massive

30:00.389 --> 30:05.235
aid? So I really don't know. I can see so many 
different scenarios occurring. But by and large,

30:12.608 --> 30:17.656
I'm extremely sympathetic to what they're trying 
to do. Do you ever have any aspirations of entering

30:17.676 --> 30:21.021
an administration? Not really. I had to make a 
choice about seven or eight years ago when I was

30:23.244 --> 30:31.357
offered a department headship at another 
institution. I think as you go through the

30:31.377 --> 30:41.232
university experience, at one time or another, 
everybody starts thinking, gee, I wonder what it

30:31.377 --> 30:41.232
would be like to be a dean or a department head, or do 
this or do that. And perhaps that's right. The

30:43.625 --> 30:49.191
thing that I had to convince myself is that being a 
department head and a dean is not a promotion. That

30:49.211 --> 30:53.296
there are, in fact, only three ranks within the 
university other than the students. Assistant,

30:54.037 --> 30:55.919
associate, and full professor. Everything else 
is ancillary. A department head and a dean is there

30:59.344 --> 31:04.009
to serve the faculty, not for the faculty to serve 
him. And administration then, from that point of

31:05.831 --> 31:10.577
view, is no longer an appeal. And I refuse to accept 
a deanship as being looked upon as a promotion. I

31:16.434 --> 31:36.237
can do everything that I want from this desk as a 
full professor, insofar as giving advice,

31:16.434 --> 31:36.237
insofar as counseling, insofar as doing my 
research, and most of all, having a sense of

31:16.434 --> 31:36.237
freedom to do what I want to do without having to 
answer or fear for my job.

31:36.257 --> 31:38.640
Is there anything else that we need to touch on 
before closing? I don't think so. Of course, we

31:40.415 --> 31:45.312
could, you know, what somebody said, scratch a 
professor and you find a demagogue, as you can see.

31:48.282 --> 31:50.048
Well, I certainly appreciate your taking the 
time.
