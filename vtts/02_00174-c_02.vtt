WEBVTT

00:02.815 --> 00:06.640
Academia was always a real shame, I thought. But 
gosh, I'm trying to think of what the people, what

00:06.720 --> 00:15.653
his nickname was in the class. Well, he was in

00:16.714 --> 00:24.545
his own stratus.

00:25.206 --> 00:31.995
As you look back, who were some of the most 
important teachers and the most important

00:25.206 --> 00:31.995
courses in forming What you became as a 
veterinarian. The course in pathology, of

00:36.206 --> 00:44.136
course, was not surprisingly with Hilton Smith. 
Hilton Smith was a, he just blew me away. And of

00:48.602 --> 00:53.568
course, Dr. John was important while I was a 
student. But I'd say that Dr. John's, my view of him

00:53.588 --> 01:02.539
really developed even further when he was my 
department head as an employee.

01:08.732 --> 01:16.823
But Dr. Smith was such

01:08.732 --> 01:16.823
a broadly knowledgeable individual. And so

01:18.245 --> 01:23.633
he was

01:27.140 --> 01:30.785
I guess the most influential single person. Al 
Price was still, I have to think of Al Price as

01:31.165 --> 01:54.615
having a big influence on me because he just, you 
know, I think of him as the guy that if you think

01:31.165 --> 01:54.615
about one of these spirited horses, not that I was 
that spirited, but a horse that's kind of trying

01:31.165 --> 01:54.615
his reins all the time. And then somebody comes 
along with an air of authority and jerks on those

01:55.490 --> 02:04.100
reins just one time, you know, and gets his 
attention. Well, Al Price jerked on the reins for

02:04.721 --> 02:07.124
me. All right. Did Dr. Smith plant a pathology seed 
in your heart and mind? Yeah. To be that

02:14.993 --> 02:23.944
knowledgeable of disease, he's the one who 
introduced me to, disease is a subject matter. And

02:27.020 --> 02:41.220
that's when I began, that was the beginning then of 
my deteriorating vision of large animals.

02:41.280 --> 02:46.988
Because I had a new

02:41.280 --> 02:46.988
love, I guess. Did you talk this over with anybody? 
This change in, this change of feeling? It

02:53.918 --> 02:54.859
happened. over, I wouldn't say that I discussed 
the pros and cons of it. I talked with Dr. Smith from

03:03.084 --> 03:05.287
time to time. And he presented, I was one of the 
people that persuaded him to teach an elective

03:05.367 --> 03:14.061
course, which he'd never done. That was the only 
time he ever taught an elective course in just

03:14.121 --> 03:21.994
large animal pathology.

03:23.324 --> 03:32.380
And I got enough of my classmates to take it so it 
could be offered.

03:35.465 --> 03:47.205
But just interacting with him on kind of learning 
how he ticked, just what made him go. by talking

03:48.890 --> 03:52.013
with him in class and so on. His labs were just a 
total fascination to me, the way he would handle

03:52.474 --> 03:59.161
students. He was a very mild-mannered person, and 
he was embarrassed when he embarrassed a student,

03:59.181 --> 04:09.512
but he would still do it. Now, what year was that 
class? Sophomore, second year. Second year. was

04:16.953 --> 04:46.015
there any uh during the first or second year were 
there any supposed roadblocks where if somebody

04:16.953 --> 04:46.015
was going to flunk out that it normally happened at 
this point or drop out it normally happened well

04:16.953 --> 04:46.015
the the uh gross anatomy course with gibbs always 
caught some and that was what year second that was a

04:16.953 --> 04:46.015
spring of the first year of the first year okay um 
And usually there'd be one or two in biochemistry.

04:53.682 --> 05:01.428
And you never had any thought about driving out of 
vet school and going to some other profession? Not

05:01.449 --> 05:02.209
seriously. I did think about it, though, because I 
had a couple of my really good friends that did

05:02.309 --> 05:08.555
that. My best friend, who I thought regarded as my 
best friend, was a man by the name of Giles Shannon,

05:09.936 --> 05:16.862
who whose father had always wanted him to be a 
physician, and yet he wanted to be a veterinarian.

05:25.103 --> 05:37.960
And his dad died shortly after we got into vet 
school, or shortly after we started vet school,

05:25.103 --> 05:37.960
and he decided that he wouldn't change at that 
point. So you thought about it briefly? And I

05:40.703 --> 05:45.870
thought about it at that time and decided, no, if I 
had, you know...

05:48.938 --> 05:50.620
I'm not sure what I would do now. I think as I 
reflected on it subsequently in latter years, it

05:50.800 --> 06:06.679
would have been a lot easier to do the things that I 
have done professionally if I had gone to medical

05:50.800 --> 06:06.679
school. If you had a serious item to discuss when 
you were in vet school, was there anybody you went

06:07.981 --> 06:17.072
to for advice and counsel?

06:22.385 --> 06:51.733
well

06:22.385 --> 06:51.733
no one there was not a system set up for us now we had a

06:22.385 --> 06:51.733
we had a new physiology teacher by the name of Ed 
McMurray he had just come he came back and we were

06:22.385 --> 06:51.733
the first class he taught and he was a an individual 
that people just kind of migrated to and of course

06:53.063 --> 07:18.987
you know this was a real gift for him and he he began 
to do that and that was really his life calling I

06:53.063 --> 07:18.987
think to to be a counselor and but he was not putting 
himself forth that way for us and

07:22.072 --> 07:35.167
We had, I had a classmate, one of my older 
classmates was really the father figure for our

07:22.072 --> 07:35.167
class, for the younger ones, Bill Kirksey is his 
name. K-I-R-K-S-E-Y.

07:38.811 --> 07:45.278
Bill is retired now, but he had a career in practice 
in Fort Worth. So y'all would go to him for... His

07:47.992 --> 08:11.417
wife, Clara, was the first librarian in the vet 
school, and she actually had that job as a student

07:47.992 --> 08:11.417
position,

07:47.992 --> 08:11.417
kind of a student-level position at the 
beginning, but she was the first librarian for the

07:47.992 --> 08:11.417
vet school. And when that year ends, you have done 
well and you're pleased, is that right? Mm-hmm.

08:18.814 --> 08:19.875
And what did you do that summer? Back to the oil 
field. Back to the oil field. Then you come back as a

08:23.620 --> 08:25.442
sophomore.

08:28.065 --> 08:29.187
Had much changed? Was it you felt good that you were 
on the right track? Yeah, I was totally caught up in

08:35.415 --> 08:41.202
it. what I was studying and everything. I mean, I 
was preparing, you know, very satisfied with my

08:44.717 --> 08:50.384
career choice. And Dean Price was not yet, he was 
not yet, Al Price was not yet the dean. No, that

08:55.451 --> 09:05.265
happened after I graduated in the, see, I went on 
the faculty to the big enticement for, really was

09:06.730 --> 09:10.816
that I would be able to work under Al Price. And that 
lasted for two months. And then he became dean. And

09:15.543 --> 09:23.935
you're beginning to, are you beginning to think 
about pathology as a sophomore? Well, that

09:25.397 --> 09:36.012
happened in the, I would say that was in the, toward 
the end of that second year. that I began to think,

09:36.295 --> 09:41.002
well, you know, this wouldn't be a bad thing to do. 
Were there any special courses or teachers you had

09:41.022 --> 09:44.147
that second year? Well, Hilton Smith. Hilton 
Smith. In the spring, we had Dick Turk. In the fall,

09:52.600 --> 09:54.343
we had Rural Bells. Dick Turk was on sabbatical. 
R.D. Turk? Yeah. What was his nickname? Did you all

10:00.713 --> 10:02.015
have a nickname for him? Hmm. No, there have been 
some, but I don't, we didn't, we were so pleased to

10:06.097 --> 10:14.585
have him. He was something else, you know. Now,

10:19.209 --> 10:23.153
I gather. P.W. Burns, we had, of course, Pappy 
Burns was our physiology teacher. Now, Ed

10:31.021 --> 10:35.665
McMurray came in then in the spring and started 
teaching. He taught the physiology in the spring,

10:36.050 --> 10:46.701
and then that freed Dr. Burns up to teach 
toxicology, which was then a third year course.

10:48.102 --> 10:51.286
And so we only had him for one semester. Was there 
any encouragement for you all to go home in the

10:52.547 --> 10:59.694
summer and do something specifically related to 
veterinary medicine?

11:02.577 --> 11:03.458
No, it wasn't. It was after your third year. There 
was

11:07.104 --> 11:15.776
quite a lot of emphasis, I guess, placed on that. 
Yeah, I went to work in Wichita Falls at the big

11:16.517 --> 11:20.943
practice. It was one of the plums, and I was very 
fortunate to... And it was a mixed practice? Mixed

11:27.752 --> 11:28.773
practice, uh-huh. And you say big. How many 
veterinarians? Two veterinarians, but they...

11:32.733 --> 11:34.615
two owners, Barrington and Dewey. But they 
typically would work one or two others. And then

11:40.082 --> 11:50.014
after my time there and later, well, by the 60s, I 
think that was a four or five-man practice. Now, by

11:50.695 --> 11:59.486
and large, in that era, veterinarians were single 
practice operations generally? Yeah. That was

12:02.939 --> 12:05.584
the most common mode, I'd say. And if more than one, 
it would be two. You rarely saw a three or four

12:10.654 --> 12:14.842
person practice. And that was the case in Houston 
as well. When you saw multiple. people practice,

12:24.961 --> 12:26.703
it would be two people. How soon did you students 
begin to get pretty sure in the large or small

12:27.124 --> 12:36.716
animal practice goal?

12:40.121 --> 12:50.074
There were a few students who came in from, like the 
Houston folk, all but one of them, there was one of

12:40.121 --> 12:50.074
them that was equine and the others were They came 
wanting to be, their model was a small animal

12:50.898 --> 12:56.507
practitioner and that's what they wanted to be. 
But except for that group and maybe there were a

12:57.428 --> 13:14.714
couple from

12:57.428 --> 13:14.714
Fort Worth who came out of a small animal practice 
background and wanted it. But other than that, I'd

13:17.003 --> 13:23.331
say most of us were kind of mixed orientation and 
keeping your options open. That was a common term.

13:24.833 --> 13:30.561
Were there many who were dreaming of going into 
industrial research or anything? Uh-uh. And were

13:32.063 --> 13:40.514
there any that during those four years of vet 
school, were there any of y'all that were dreaming

13:32.063 --> 13:40.514
of being an academic?

13:43.077 --> 13:43.197
Mm-mm. I wasn't at all. See, mine all happened with 
Armistead. I went in to speak with Armistead

13:47.789 --> 13:59.245
because I knew that he had, not very many years 
before that, he had done a PhD. And so I

13:59.366 --> 14:07.898
thought he would be a likely resource person. I'd 
seen this flyer from Purdue about, graduate

14:14.463 --> 14:40.842
assistantships for veterinarians who wanted to 
do a graduate study and and it was the way it was

14:14.463 --> 14:40.842
written it was obvious that they were basically 
working on livestock diseases and now but this was

14:14.463 --> 14:40.842
in my senior year that I saw that and got it twicked 
my curiosity a little bit and so I went to see farmer

14:42.627 --> 14:44.649
said, just to talk to him about that. What would you 
do if I were to go to that and do that and get another

14:45.670 --> 14:54.841
degree, what would I do then? And

14:54.881 --> 15:00.848
so that's... What did he say? What was his answer? 
Well, he said that he told me about some of the

15:02.570 --> 15:08.196
opportunities that there would be to work in the 
field of research like with pharmaceutical firms

15:08.986 --> 15:19.480
or go to work for the government or go into 
academia. And that was what year? That was my

15:23.686 --> 15:25.048
fourth year. And then he kind of did a big however. 
He just happened to have this opening that he had

15:36.509 --> 16:01.808
developed and he was very interested in and he had 
set this up because there was as a way to to allow

15:36.509 --> 16:01.808
young veterinarians to

15:36.509 --> 16:01.808
learn about academic veterinary medicine and He 
thought I would be a good candidate for that. Now,

16:05.582 --> 16:08.385
did he invite you, or did you go to see him? Well, I 
went to see him about the Purdue thing. I asked for

16:11.528 --> 16:14.750
an appointment and saw him. But then he turned the 
tables. Academically, you were second in your

16:18.514 --> 16:20.896
class? No, I was fourth, I think. Okay. Now, and 
with that, with these grades being posted, by and

16:25.280 --> 16:31.305
large, did... Did people have a kind of a ranking 
for each class? Yeah, well, I don't know how many of

16:36.970 --> 16:45.663
my classmates would have known where I was. 
Everyone knew that Wallace Klebb was the top.

16:48.708 --> 16:49.048
Okay. And Bill Kirksey was probably the second. 
Did they know that there were also a few that were

16:53.294 --> 16:56.359
down right at the bottom? Yeah. And were there some 
who were in jeopardy almost every semester? Yeah.

17:01.826 --> 17:02.828
Is that? Yeah. Just skim by. But those guys didn't 
care for the most part. And did y'all have a, as you

17:09.661 --> 17:20.462
went through, did the feeling of class pride and 
pulling together, did that Oh yeah, that was very

17:20.611 --> 17:23.074
strong in our class. How did you all help each 
other? Give some examples of where the class

17:25.116 --> 17:33.225
helped each other, either academically or when 
there was a personal crisis or whatever.

17:38.410 --> 17:47.260
Well, whenever one of the, we would work with the 
students who were would be having problems and

17:48.674 --> 17:54.503
would get into trouble and would be flunking a 
course, for example. You all would help them with

17:54.523 --> 17:57.828
the homework and study in the lab? We were, this was 
pretty common with, now Cleb didn't do very much of

17:59.210 --> 18:06.901
that.

18:10.266 --> 18:16.335
It wasn't that he wasn't willing to, but he was a 
very, he was a stoic individual. And

18:17.834 --> 18:22.621
he just wasn't able to help. He tried a number of 
times, but it didn't take, because he didn't know

18:24.144 --> 18:33.879
what to tell people or what to say to them. And we had 
some others of us that were kind of part-time

18:35.421 --> 18:44.315
tutors, I guess, for students. Do you remember any 
crises where somebody had a tragedy or an illness

18:47.146 --> 18:52.012
or an injury that somebody helped with?

18:57.239 --> 19:01.064
What about somebody that ended up short of money? 
Did anybody help? Did you lend it to anybody? Well,

19:06.270 --> 19:08.833
that was just part of life at the time.

19:12.578 --> 19:13.980
Yeah, there were some. helping out along that line 
that went on. And among the most feared courses in

19:17.943 --> 19:22.950
the four years were what? Supposedly the 
toughest, and you were glad to get them done. Well,

19:29.298 --> 19:33.523
that gross anatomy course was one. A

19:33.543 --> 19:39.951
lot of students worried about the embryology 
course that Al Price taught, because it was very

19:40.876 --> 19:48.446
challenging. And then the toxicology course that 
Dr. Burns taught was probably, if you were to poll

19:49.607 --> 20:09.432
my classmates, that's probably the course that 
would be listed, be between that and the gross

19:49.607 --> 20:09.432
anatomy course. It was a surgery course that was 
pretty intimidating, but it was so interesting

20:10.255 --> 20:20.945
that nobody shied away from it. Looking back on all 
four years, what do you wish there had been more of

20:21.746 --> 20:29.874
and perhaps less of? If you've only got four years 
to do it, was there any modification in hindsight?

20:40.462 --> 21:05.912
Well

20:40.462 --> 21:05.912
there were from at the time that I finished I had a 
feeling that the public health courses were had

20:40.462 --> 21:05.912
been a pretty much a waste of time and that there I 
would have wished to have been able to substitute

20:40.462 --> 21:05.912
in some

21:08.626 --> 21:38.565
disease courses on the disease of the animal more 
in depth on that but you know that very much

21:08.626 --> 21:38.565
reflects the bias that I had in those courses at 
least one of those courses was very important that

21:08.626 --> 21:38.565
in that time that the public health course because 
a large I say a large I mean there were several of my

21:08.626 --> 21:38.565
classmates that at one time or another worked in 
the brucellosis eradication program And

21:39.322 --> 21:50.556
there are several of them that have made 
substantial contributions to the USDA program.

21:52.138 --> 22:00.989
Is there anything you didn't do enough of?

22:01.009 --> 22:01.229
Yeah. Given that there were only four years and it 
had to be

22:14.320 --> 22:43.500
again at the time that I finished I guess my feeling 
was it would have been I really wish there had been

22:14.320 --> 22:43.500
more opportunity to have hands on experience with 
cases we didn't have we weren't put in a position of

22:14.320 --> 22:43.500
responsibility very well we would be like with in 
small animal for example we'd be we were exposed to

22:45.337 --> 23:14.584
the cases and we did and we held animals and things 
like that but we we there was only one of the small

22:45.337 --> 23:14.584
animal clinicians I thought that was really very 
good at trying to draw out the thoughts of the

22:45.337 --> 23:14.584
students on pieces and not to the extent I mean our 
people now I just marvel of course you know in the I

23:15.509 --> 23:33.534
worked not as a clinician, but there among the 
clinicians in the position that I had after I was

23:15.509 --> 23:33.534
department head, and as I had before I was 
department head, being kind of the hospital

23:15.509 --> 23:33.534
pathologist, if you will. And I just marvel at 
the... job that those people do in involving the

23:36.805 --> 23:40.429
students. They really do a good job now.

23:45.794 --> 23:58.046
Looking at those four years, what did A&M do best 
and what did it do worst in veterinary medicine

23:45.794 --> 23:58.046
then?

23:58.066 --> 24:06.694
Or at least best, maybe I can phrase that in a 
positive way.

24:06.910 --> 24:36.698
best was would have been the equine work working 
with horses equine medicine and equine surgery

24:06.910 --> 24:36.698
and also livestock medicine at that time with 
cattle particularly we did much more of that then

24:06.910 --> 24:36.698
it was a much larger segment of of the hospital 
operation than it is now. And that's not to say

24:39.906 --> 24:43.211
anything against the present hospital. It's just 
society now in a way. We have so many more private

24:45.634 --> 24:49.319
practitioners now. There were virtually none in 
this community when I was in vet school.

25:05.720 --> 25:16.210
I think

25:05.720 --> 25:16.210
our education was very, very tailored.

25:16.330 --> 25:20.533
It was very much tailored to prepare us for a 
practice career. We had... There was nothing done

25:23.396 --> 25:30.963
to make us aware of non-practice opportunities. 
And I think it's really... amazing that as many of

25:36.803 --> 26:06.793
my my class and the class of classes around me that 
wound up doing things other than practices

25:36.803 --> 26:06.793
probably kind of remarkable but it would have been 
uh

25:36.803 --> 26:06.793
much better if we could have had some exposure to 
our to the other well research for example but

25:36.803 --> 26:06.793
there were there wasn't There were very few 
research programs that were funded. There was

26:11.809 --> 26:16.415
very little money, research money, in the vet 
school at the time I was in vet school. As far as you

26:17.316 --> 26:24.545
were aware, you and your friends, your classmates 
at that time, how did A&M's veterinary program

26:17.316 --> 26:24.545
compare nationally? Where did you all think it 
ranked?

26:31.674 --> 26:35.239
Well, we felt it was one of the good ones. We didn't 
know. This

26:36.946 --> 26:46.480
was not a point of very much concern to us. That's 
what I was going to say. I'll bet there wasn't much

26:47.501 --> 26:49.625
discussion then of that. No, it

26:50.225 --> 27:00.861
just wasn't an item to think about or worry about. 
Did anybody ever discuss, any of you veterinary

27:01.364 --> 27:11.721
students, ever discuss women attending this 
program and or black students? Never talked about

27:14.145 --> 27:17.591
the absence of either one. That's what I would have 
guessed. And we didn't, I guess we, our view of

27:20.596 --> 27:27.507
veterinary medicine was pretty chauvinistic, I 
guess. But it wasn't a matter of seeing it as

27:30.983 --> 27:37.652
something that males were deserving of. It was 
just the

27:37.672 --> 27:46.925
occupation was just kind of a hazardous sort of a 
thing. It's like women playing football. Of

27:48.767 --> 27:58.320
course, now it has evolved just so much in the other 
direction. Now, I've just about run out of

27:59.279 --> 28:01.342
questions. Are there some important topics we 
haven't touched? Well, nothing that occurs to me.

28:09.613 --> 28:19.467
I wasn't particularly, well, let's

28:09.613 --> 28:19.467
see. As you look back, were there any funny, goofy, 
humorous events you can recall during those four

28:21.069 --> 28:28.459
years?

28:34.582 --> 28:38.005
Let students ever play a joke on one of the faculty?

28:41.269 --> 28:45.493
Other than those you mentioned a while ago on 
Gibbs?

28:52.880 --> 29:02.530
Oh, well, when we moved, I worked for Physiology 
Department. Dr. Burns had set up, during that era,

29:03.151 --> 29:25.065
had set up two or three student positions for 
students that were in their third year in vet

29:03.151 --> 29:25.065
school after they'd finished their second year 
when they had physiology. Well, then they were

29:25.545 --> 29:27.869
student assistants. I can't remember if it was two 
or four students that he did. two or four

29:33.442 --> 29:35.145
positions. But anyway, he had some positions. And 
I was able to get one of those. And there

29:41.735 --> 29:47.784
must have been four of us involved. But we were 
involved then in moving physiology from the main

29:47.804 --> 30:01.525
campus out to the buildings across the tracks.

30:03.260 --> 30:08.107
One of the guys, he was not in one of those 
positions, but a guy by the name of Helms. He was a

30:08.548 --> 30:18.582
classmate of mine who was working, I guess,

30:08.548 --> 30:18.582
on hourly wages just to help move stuff out. And Dr. 
Burns had a supply. He had containers of

30:23.089 --> 30:27.495
unadulterated absolute alcohol that he was very 
protective of, as he should have been. And

30:34.086 --> 30:45.500
he left the container open, well, the cabinet 
unlocked one day. And old Helms got into that and

30:45.580 --> 30:50.305
got some out of the pharmacy. He found some of the 
tincture of cherry syrup or something like that

30:50.906 --> 30:56.993
for flavoring. He just had a party out there. Now 
that wasn't a prank on Dr. Burns, but boy, it really

30:58.636 --> 31:06.627
infuriated him, because he fell down the stairs. 
He was so inebriated that he fell down the stairs.

31:11.434 --> 31:19.825
But earlier, the thing that was a prank that turned 
out
