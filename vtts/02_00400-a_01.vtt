Bueno, díganme más sobre esta hacienda de 
Dolores. Bueno, yo nací allí. Yo nomás nací allí en

00:45.097 --> 00:52.826
la hacienda de Dolores porque allí trabajaba mi 
padre y recibían ellos. Era, pues, como verigrace

00:52.866 --> 00:57.831
aquí un rancho que hay muchos There were a lot of 
people to work with. But the little town where they

01:02.453 --> 01:06.998
went was called Padilla, Tamaulipas. And now it's 
a big town. The town is called what? Padilla,

01:11.263 --> 01:13.826
Tamaulipas. And it was close to what? Ciudad 
Victoria. It's the capital of Padilla and the

01:17.390 --> 01:21.895
neighboring towns, like here. Like Austin and all 
these towns in the capital of Texas. The capital of

01:29.061 --> 01:32.104
Tamaulipas. And was the Delores farm very big? My 
father told me that it was. There were many

01:38.710 --> 01:40.532
workers. And what kind of crops did they have? They 
were all farmers, workers. seeders of corn,

01:50.478 --> 01:56.685
because it was what they sowed in Mexico. Corn, 
beans, cane to make the sweet, the sweet. My father

02:04.293 --> 02:13.964
worked in that, it was called the molienda, where 
they ground all the cane to get the sweetness out of

02:04.293 --> 02:13.964
the cane, to make the sweet and make the sweet. As 
they make molasses here, there is one, and there

02:13.984 --> 02:19.590
they made the sweet, they made it and then they Yes, 
he is a work specialist. And your mother too? No, my

02:26.288 --> 02:28.190
mother didn't work. My mother only worked at home. 
My mother would look after us, make my father's

02:30.312 --> 02:37.620
food, wash, iron. How many children were there? 
When we were there, there were only three of us. Me,

02:43.386 --> 02:48.852
my older sister who lives in Corpus, Mrs. 
Martinez, and me. and my brother, who died four

02:49.169 --> 02:54.174
years ago. And these other three were born here in 
the United States. Juan, my brother, Maria, my

02:58.057 --> 03:06.105
brother, and Manuel, my brother, the youngest in 
the family. I lived here in the colony. And in this

03:11.190 --> 03:16.334
farm, how many years did you have? Well, when we 
moved here, Where my father went, it was called the

03:19.257 --> 03:26.087
Rosario Farm. Yes. Also a farm with a lot of 
agriculture. Yes. Well, that's where my father

03:28.831 --> 03:36.422
spent a lot of time, and that's where my father 
moved here, to the United States. What year?

03:36.943 --> 03:37.884
August 14, 1916. 16. He moved here, to the United 
States. And since then, he has never returned to

03:42.391 --> 03:45.896
Mexico. No? No. Why not? Well... Later on, he 
needed a lot of permission. He didn't know how to

03:55.190 --> 04:04.100
read, my father, but he was a very correct man with 
all people. He didn't want to say that he wanted to

04:04.120 --> 04:08.945
violate the law of the United States. That's why he 
never went back to Mexico. He said that his mother

04:13.510 --> 04:17.935
and sisters had already finished. And if I have my 
family here, why would I go? That's why she was

04:23.789 --> 04:25.191
never there for me. And you, no? No, I went to see 
Matamoros. I only know Matamoros. Yes. Because I

04:31.839 --> 04:34.723
had some relatives, an aunt. No, not her, not her 
daughters. And they came with us when my father

04:36.385 --> 04:39.089
died. After my father died, at the age of two, my 
aunt, my father's little sister, died. And my

04:45.497 --> 04:48.681
brother, Manuel. I had vacations, so they wanted 
us to go. And we went so that I could stay there for a

04:53.097 --> 05:03.367
few weeks, so that I wouldn't forget a little. 
Because my parents both died the same week. And

05:07.771 --> 05:11.194
your family never wants to live in Mexico again? 
Well, no, because they are from here, my brothers.

05:15.277 --> 05:16.899
Oh, yes, your brothers are from here. And my 
parents died. I'm Mexican, but what am I going to do

05:20.048 --> 05:23.352
there? I have my siblings. I have my papers. I have 
my passport. My parents fixed my passport. Jose

05:32.184 --> 05:37.631
fixed his, because he lost his passport. He went to 
immigration. They asked him why he didn't give me

05:40.635 --> 05:43.639
his passport. He said, I'm going to tell you the 
truth. He said, I don't know how to read or write.

05:49.208 --> 05:50.629
You didn't? No. You didn't go to school? No, 
because when we were little, we lived in a ranch

05:53.893 --> 06:05.044
called Casamorada. It was close to Canara, but 
there were seven days to come on foot. My father

06:10.690 --> 06:18.118
said it was very hard for us to come on foot, except 
for the two of us, me and my sister. And this one was

06:18.318 --> 06:23.224
here, right? Yes. How old were you when you left 
Mexico? I was six, I think. I was born in 1910 and we

06:31.674 --> 06:35.838
passed on in 1916. I was about six years old, but I 
was five and a half years old. And your older sister

06:42.566 --> 06:46.551
went to school in Mexico? No. Are there schools in 
this estate? Yes, there were, but my parents came

06:50.012 --> 06:52.676
here. Yes.

06:55.961 --> 07:10.562
No, it wasn't school yet, because in Mexico, my 
mother and I, some of them were older, others

06:55.961 --> 07:10.562
younger, like that. Yes. That's why we didn't have 
a school. None of my brothers had a school. No? No.

07:16.672 --> 07:17.813
Your brothers, no? No. Those who were born here? 
No, because they were the ones who lived in Calale.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.302
In the ranch. In the ranch. And it was very far. The 
school was here, in Calale. How many miles is the

07:29.889 --> 07:32.772
school? Well, there was... I think there's about 
six or seven miles from Calale to that ranch. We had

07:40.242 --> 07:40.882
to walk. And there were no buses or anything? No, 
there were before. In 19...

07:48.532 --> 07:49.353
I was 23, 24. 23, yes. There was no... That's why 
many people said, well, now the children don't go

07:51.136 --> 07:57.945
to school. Because they don't want to, because 
there are voices for them to go, right? Yes. So, no.

08:05.396 --> 08:10.383
My father said, well, I don't send my girls to 
school because they are very far away. They are

08:10.423 --> 08:11.524
girls, women. Well, there were my boys, well, two, 
who were my brother and sister. The other one was

08:17.422 --> 08:21.467
younger, he was in high school, I think, Juan. But 
then they treated them very badly, the other boys

08:22.649 --> 08:27.816
from school, they treated them very badly. And my 
dad said, well, one day they're going to hit them,

08:27.836 --> 08:34.986
they're going to break their foot or something. 
And it's very far, so when I go, I'm going to bring

08:35.006 --> 08:39.091
them. And he lived working, because all the time he 
was a farmer, my dad. Yes. He worked all the time at

08:43.617 --> 08:45.640
the ranch as a farmer. But is this work in the farm 
more important or not? In Mexico, yes. Well, it was

08:53.799 --> 08:55.521
their work. There were a lot of workers, my mother 
said. The work was purely to make canals, you know?

09:03.893 --> 09:04.174
Yes. To water the work. Yes. With pure shovel. Yes. 
Do you know what a shovel is? To build. There wasn't

09:11.004 --> 09:14.749
like here, where they did it with machines and 
everything. Yes. In those years that my father

09:15.776 --> 09:23.525
lived, he was young, he only had my sister and me. We 
were three in the family. Yes. We were six in the

09:28.831 --> 09:33.095
family. Well, for what reason did you come here to 
the United States? Well, they came when, you

09:41.225 --> 09:44.348
remember, here also in some I don't know, years 
ago. A lot of people also went to Mexico because

09:46.795 --> 09:52.962
there was going to be a lot of war here in the United 
States, right? Yes. Well, then, in Mexico there

09:53.082 --> 10:01.071
was also a lot of war and a lot of people came here 
because the war was very hard there. Tell me about

10:01.091 --> 10:01.892
this war. Well, I don't know, but my mom says that 
that's why they came from there, from where they

10:02.413 --> 10:10.362
lived, from where they lived. Yes. Because there 
was a lot of war. Like there is now in Vietnam. So

10:18.080 --> 10:24.986
many people who run from other towns to mountains, 
to mountains, to hide. And in Mexico, I think they

10:25.006 --> 10:27.649
were born like that too. And a lot of people came 
because they were not going to kill their

10:27.669 --> 10:34.215
children. They were civilians, they were not 
soldiers in the war. And many soldiers came and

10:41.551 --> 10:45.895
entered a town. Yes. And for that reason, many 
people, many families came to see my mother. Well,

10:52.762 --> 10:58.047
I don't know, my mother talked to us and my father 
didn't. Yes, yes. Well, it was very dangerous.

11:00.389 --> 11:02.351
Well, I think so. And many, many people were 
killed. Who knows, I think, I don't know. My mother

11:07.856 --> 11:10.579
says that's why they came here. First they went to 
Hacienda

11:11.521 --> 11:21.694
del Rosario, on the other side of the river. 
Hacienda del Rosario, it's closer to the river.

11:25.719 --> 11:32.768
Yes,

11:25.719 --> 11:32.768
it's close to Matamoros, over there. Yes. From 
Matamoros to here. And less war there? No, no, no,

11:38.369 --> 11:39.610
no. In this hacienda, Rosario. Ah, no, no. There 
was no peaceful like here. Ah, it was more peaceful

11:45.016 --> 11:49.180
in these years. Yes. But Hacienda de Dolores was 
not peaceful. Well, no, because they came

11:52.303 --> 11:58.990
suddenly like in Vietnam, so peaceful, and 
suddenly they began to fight, you know? Yes. The

11:59.810 --> 12:00.371
war. Well, that's how it was in Mexico in those 
years. Yes. That's why many people came here. Many

12:06.757 --> 12:07.498
families. They came from this town to here. Other 
towns also came. Yes. And then my mother and I

12:14.970 --> 12:19.597
stayed at the Rosario farm. And then my father went 
to work here. And until I say that it was very hard

12:21.199 --> 12:27.048
for her to be there with us and him here. Maybe he 
tried to find a way to get by. And then they didn't

12:30.172 --> 12:34.579
pay anything, just a nickel and they passed. Here? 
Yes. Ah, just a nickel? Para pasar entonces. Ah,

12:39.569 --> 12:40.510
para pasar. Sí, para pasar el río, you know. Sí. 
Como ahora usted va para México, pues pasa por el

12:43.393 --> 12:47.497
puente. Pero la chequean el pasaporte, los 
papeles y todo. Entonces, no, nomás le pagaba un

12:52.041 --> 12:58.867
nikle o un daimel por, según la familia que 
tuviera, y se la pasaba. Ah, ¿en qué pueblo pasaba?

13:01.830 --> 13:07.135
En,

13:01.830 --> 13:07.135
yo creo que es en Toluca, Toluca. On the side of 
Mercedes. Toluca, Tamaulipas? No, Toluca,

13:11.689 --> 13:13.491
Texas. Toluca, Texas? Ah, yes. I think it's in the 
middle of Mercedes and Tona. I don't know. I don't

13:21.362 --> 13:22.204
know. I don't know those towns. I don't know much. 
Because when I was older, we came to Roestán with an

13:26.229 --> 13:32.698
aunt of mine. With my aunt, a sister of my father. 
And I came with her. With her? With your aunt? Yes.

13:40.510 --> 13:46.579
And another little sister, the one who didn't die. 
A little sister who was born in the Rosary and my mom

13:46.659 --> 13:51.427
brought her a baby when she came. But she died here 
when she was 12 years old. Oh, how sad. Yes,

13:56.995 --> 14:01.542
because, how do you say it? We were working, 
working, and she was 12 years old. In that, we went

14:06.565 --> 14:17.180
like this, and I said, Papa, go for a walk, so we can 
go back to work. And they put on some long linen

14:17.260 --> 14:19.964
dresses for the pizca. Yes. Very curious. And she 
was putting them on, and a cart was coming. So the

14:24.450 --> 14:27.534
auntie said, come on, little girl, get out of the 
cart. And she got very scared. She got very scared.

14:32.241 --> 14:34.223
Making me be scared, you know? Very nervous. Yes. Y 
ella dijo el doctor, cuando mi papá la llevó con el

14:36.805 --> 14:45.877
doctor, mi mamá, que ella estaba, ¿cómo? Cuando es 
girl at 20 years old is making, para ser una girl,

14:45.917 --> 14:51.804
you know? Paseo a mujer. Sí, bueno. Ella estaba, el 
doctor dijo que ella estaba para hacerse así, una

14:54.387 --> 14:58.653
señorita. Sí. Y ella se asustó mucho y todo su blood 
se stopped, you know? Se stopped, you know, coming

15:03.579 --> 15:05.842
in. Blood? Uh-huh. Her blood didn't go down 
anymore. And that's why she died very soon. How

15:17.006 --> 15:18.008
sad. Yes. Her mother died three weeks later. And 
she was very sad. She didn't talk and she didn't

15:30.544 --> 15:33.508
feel bad. No tenía fiebre, no tenía nada. No 
tuviste. No tuviste. Y no. Stop. Porque dijo el

15:42.584 --> 15:47.349
doctor que se veía todas las... Estas big venas, 
you know? Estas. Sí. Se... Stop. No caminaron con

15:50.673 --> 15:52.495
el big susto. Y ella estaba para hacerse una picro, 
una señorita. Sí. Se stop. Con el big susto del

15:57.881 --> 16:00.083
carro. Porque venía el hombro muy grueso y ella 
venía así. She

16:04.285 --> 16:09.511
didn't say anything, no talk, no nothing. She was 
very scared and then she started talking, but she

16:10.292 --> 16:16.580
said she was very scared. Are there doctors to 
assist her? Yes, doctors cured her and

16:21.265 --> 16:26.631
everything, but all the doctors said it was the 
same. Because she was very young, she was 12 years

16:26.772 --> 16:30.156
old, 13. She was going to get a surgery. a lady, and 
she said, that's very bad, that's a very bad scare,

16:34.103 --> 16:48.921
when they are going to start to do a bichloro, 
that's a very bad

16:34.103 --> 16:48.921
scare. And she died in this ranch? No, she died here 
by the Hawaii Nile, but then there was no Hawaii

16:51.004 --> 17:01.056
Nile, there was a little ranch, and there we lived 
with A lady who was a teacher, her name was Maria

17:02.285 --> 17:06.689
McEnbride. My father used to work with her. We 
lived there and she got sick. She died. Yes. She had

17:17.318 --> 17:18.920
many years of death. Yes. She was very young when 
she died. I was the only one left. My older sister, I

17:24.084 --> 17:27.687
have an older sister in the family, she has bodies. 
She lives in bodies. And then... Me and my brother,

17:32.187 --> 17:33.950
who died. And then Juan. This is the one from here, 
from the United States, who was born. Juan and

17:44.247 --> 17:48.234
Maria and Manuel. Two men and a woman from here. And 
from Mexico, two men, no, two women and a man. And a

17:54.805 --> 17:55.706
man, yes. There were six families. Well, and what 
kind of work did your brother Juan have? Juan Gomez

18:05.988 --> 18:11.513
Jr., the one who lived here? Or the big one? The one 
who died? Yes. All his life, from the age of 17, he

18:16.017 --> 18:20.662
started working in a junkyard. Do you know what a 
junkyard is? Where they make cars and... Oh, a

18:22.643 --> 18:26.747
place... Yes, to make cars, to cut cars. A person 
comes and wants a part of a car, for example, and

18:31.233 --> 18:35.898
they cut it. That's what he worked on. From the age 
of 17, he started working. Yes. Until he died.

18:43.507 --> 18:51.676
After his work, on Saturday, he arrived at his work 
and told his wife. He said, I'm going to take a bath,

18:51.736 --> 18:54.600
and there's your clothes. He took his bath, 
dressed, and said, I said, first of all, I'm going

18:57.608 --> 19:03.295
to pay the bills for the electricity bill. And he 
said, you know what you do, right? I said, yes. He

19:07.560 --> 19:11.184
said, I'll be back in a little while. And he left. 
And when he came back, he didn't come back. Because

19:14.969 --> 19:21.336
when he came back, a friend who worked together in 
the same place, he said, where are you going?

19:21.356 --> 19:21.677
Gámez. He said, I'm going to pay my bills. He said, 
I'm going there too. I said, come, I have a ride. He

19:26.643 --> 19:26.923
said, well. They went and paid the bills, and on the 
way back, a big truck, a garbage

19:27.241 --> 19:36.172
truck. And he killed himself. He left... With the 
garbage truck? The big truck hit them on their

19:44.022 --> 19:46.885
furniture.

19:49.388 --> 19:53.093
Two were killed, my brother and another. Another 
man, and the driver had like... Six months, like

19:57.278 --> 20:04.066
four months in the hospital, because he just broke 
down from here. But my brother died later. The

20:06.008 --> 20:11.574
other man came to the hospital, he lasted 15 
minutes, alive. My brother was taken out of the

20:11.594 --> 20:17.521
hospital.

20:17.541 --> 20:18.663
Very sad. Yes, very sad. And he left the family. 11 
children. He had 11 children. And his wife, what is

20:27.676 --> 20:34.725
possible for her with so many children? Yes, 
but... She had the oldest, he was already in

20:34.745 --> 20:41.533
Vietnam in the war. The oldest. The oldest. Yes. He 
was 18 years old and he was in Vietnam. Is he in

20:47.200 --> 20:48.201
Vietnam now? No, they already completed it. Ah, 
yes. They completed it. And does he help his mother

20:52.308 --> 20:55.812
with us? Well, yes, the children are all grown up 
and almost all of them are married. He only has two

21:00.917 --> 21:05.822
children left in the house and two children. The 
others are all married, but he is the only one left.

21:12.168 --> 21:14.290
And did she have a job? No, she never worked. Never? 
She was at home with the children and my brother. He

21:20.677 --> 21:22.078
said he didn't need to go to work because he worked. 
Yes. No, you need to go to work. I work for you, for my

21:26.611 --> 21:28.993
children. Yes. All the time, I work, I work, all the 
time. Because my father didn't teach them, he

21:34.498 --> 21:46.129
said, no, I didn't teach my children school, but I 
taught them to work and to respect people. Yes.

21:47.450 --> 21:51.554
Especially a great man of age, to respect him. Yes. 
Because when my father and mother died, they were

21:52.822 --> 21:58.588
already married. They had a family. Not a big one, 
but a small one. And they didn't smoke in front of my

22:04.073 --> 22:08.557
father. No? No. They did smoke. He knew they 
smoked, but in front of him, when they sat down to

22:09.698 --> 22:19.708
talk, and many people, now many children, their 
father was sitting and drinking, saying, they

22:09.698 --> 22:19.708
were drinking beer, right? Yes. They didn't smoke 
in front of him, because they respected his

22:20.699 --> 22:26.647
father. My father, well, he didn't teach them how 
to smoke, but he taught them how to behave well with

22:26.667 --> 22:44.550
older people, and he would say, in front of an older 
person, don't smoke, don't ask for firewood to

22:26.667 --> 22:44.550
light a cigarette, or anything like that. If they 
wanted to smoke, Ustedes carguen sus mechas o

22:49.032 --> 22:54.159
vayan a buscar lumbre en otra parte. Pero nunca le 
pidan a un señor grande de edad, a una persona más

22:54.699 --> 22:59.325
grande que ustedes. Porque no es correcto. Es 
falta de educación. Sí. Y su papá estaba muy

23:03.671 --> 23:05.693
correcto. Sí. De todos. Sí. En trabajo,

23:08.597 --> 23:13.603
en dirigir sus hijos. Cuando ya se casaron, les 
dijo, el que se casó primero fue Juan. Después del

23:19.964 --> 23:22.387
más chiquito, que fue Meme. Dijo, usted ya se le 
acabó de andar en la calle a las 11. Ya para las 8

23:29.495 --> 23:36.843
puede ir a tomarse una cerveza con sus amigos, a 
platicar un ratito. No se le quita nada, pero como

23:36.863 --> 23:42.569
Dios manda y correctamente. Pero ya para las 9 
tiene que estar en su casa, porque su obligación

23:43.750 --> 23:49.617
aquí la tiene. You have your wife, you have your 
children. You are no longer on the street. The

23:56.953 --> 23:59.717
street is for those who have not been married. You 
can talk to your friends. You can talk to your

24:00.898 --> 24:06.486
friends, but in other places you shouldn't do 
that. The street is over for you. Yes. And they were

24:09.190 --> 24:10.151
like that. They were like, as my father would say, 
they were like that. Well, where did your father

24:15.799 --> 24:18.483
come from? My father was from He was born in 
Sotolamarina. Sotolamarina. Yes, I know. She was

24:26.695 --> 24:29.178
born there and she got baptized. But he got married 
here in Hacienda Dolores in Tamaulipas. Here in

24:34.905 --> 24:36.427
Padilla with my mother. Your mother was from 
Hacienda? My mother was a native of Tamaulipas.

24:43.836 --> 24:47.741
She was born in Padilla and she got married with my 
father. My father was born in Sotolamarina. When

24:50.971 --> 25:08.895
my grandmother

24:50.971 --> 25:08.895
became a widow because her father died, my father 
came to Padilla when he was 12 years old with his

24:50.971 --> 25:08.895
mother and other sisters. Y ahí se hizo hombre. Ahí 
se enseñó a trabajar. Y ahí se hizo hombre él. Y ahí

25:14.187 --> 25:15.589
se casó con mi mamá. Sí. Con mi mamá. ¿Cómo se llama 
su papá? Juan Gámez. Juan Cruz Gámez. Juan Gámez de

25:22.339 --> 25:23.460

Diferente. Sí. Hay Gómez y nosotros hemos Gámez.

25:31.973 --> 25:32.754

Gámez. Gámez. Como esto. Gámez.

25:41.275 --> 25:48.849
Juan Gámez, the lord of the cross. He was born on the 
3rd of May, the day of the Holy Cross. He is the one

25:56.723 --> 26:03.435
who has the name of the Cross.

26:04.107 --> 26:09.236
In what year was your father born? I don't know. I do 
know, but I don't remember. When they died, there

26:13.082 --> 26:15.426
are the names on the stone. The year they were born. 
The year they died. They now have...

26:24.842 --> 26:27.246
They completed 16 years of death. Sixteen. Since 
he died? Since he died. Yes. That's where they

26:33.793 --> 26:35.314
died, where I live. In San Juan Addition, in the 
colony. That's where they died. In San Juan?

26:40.599 --> 26:41.900
Addition, here. The colony of Corpus Christi? 
Yes, here, one of mine from here. Ah, yes. And when

26:48.446 --> 26:51.929
he was your age, what kind of work did your father 
have? Well, he worked here with this lady. Mr. Hugh

26:57.061 --> 27:00.185
Weiss worked here for a long time. Yes. We lived 
here. From here we came back to the suburb, to the

27:02.588 --> 27:08.236
colony we lived in. Yes. I worked with the 
gentlemen. Well, just as I worked with the

27:10.699 --> 27:20.592
gentlemen, I made the pipes and worked, because 
before I had no job, I worked as a laborer. What year

27:20.632 --> 27:22.635
did you come here? In 1900, here with this ranch? 
Yes. We came in November of 1938.

27:32.707 --> 27:35.071
And how old were you? About 18 or 19 years old. I 
worked with them for 20 years. And then they said

27:48.089 --> 27:55.519
they were going on vacation. They left. And then I 
went to my house. I worked from 1938 to 1958. Yes.

28:04.072 --> 28:05.253
And then I went. And then I worked with other 
Americans in bodies. Yes. And from there I worked

28:12.281 --> 28:18.987
for a long time with another lady, but then she got 
married. She was a widow and she got married. And

28:22.671 --> 28:24.493
then I came and she got married. One day Rusty 
Blount told me that he was going to work with him one

28:25.553 --> 28:35.927
day. He said he didn't have a job. I said no, because 
the boss got married. She told Carola that I wasn't

28:45.058 --> 28:48.523
working. Mejor hablar. Yo tengo un año de estar 
trabajando para atrás. ¿Y para cuantos años

28:54.529 --> 28:58.794
estaba aquí ahora? Tengo un año ahora. Nueve años 
aquí. No, un año. Ahorita para atrás, de vuelta,

29:05.822 --> 29:08.345
tengo un año. Ah, de vuelta, un año. Pero 
trabajé... Twenty years with them. In these

29:13.450 --> 29:14.771
years, they married. Yes. Twenty years. I was more 
middle-aged, more young. Yes. And you never

29:20.276 --> 29:21.677
married? No. No? Why not? Well, I don't know, 
because I was... My brothers got married. My

29:27.763 --> 29:29.505
brother, Juan, got married first. And then Pedro, 
my brother, who died. Yes. He was the oldest, but he

29:33.349 --> 29:35.991
got married later. And then... My sister, 
Mariela, also lives in Alma, Colombia. And I

29:46.465 --> 29:52.651
stayed because I always... How do you say it? I was 
always very... very... How do you say it? Very

30:00.479 --> 30:03.782
content with my father and mother. Yes, yes. 
Because I worked all the time. I used to work all the

30:07.158 --> 30:12.683
time and the lady used to pay me and give me my check 
or money. I used to take it to my dad. Yes. I used to

30:14.765 --> 30:18.128
bring it to my dad. My dad used to say, that's my boy 
who keeps us. Yes. When he got married, he used to

30:21.251 --> 30:27.356
say, that's my boy who keeps us because the boys got 
married. And when I don't work, he keeps us. Yes.

30:29.198 --> 30:33.041
And that's why I never got married. Because, I 
don't know, I always wanted to be with my mom. with

30:37.162 --> 30:37.983
my mom. Yes, it's a lot of responsibility to your 
parents. And I was always there for them. And then

30:46.617 --> 30:51.685
they died and I was left alone. Yes. And then I felt 
very sad because my mom died, my dad first, and then

30:51.926 --> 30:58.316
my mom. I stayed with an aunt, excuse me, alone. And 
then she died. Yes. Two years after my mother and

31:05.596 --> 31:10.844
father died, he died. Yes. And then I was left 
alone. Then my younger brother, who lived here,

31:15.050 --> 31:18.915
moved there too. Then I had a house and sold it. I 
made that little one where I live. Yes. I live

31:28.830 --> 31:34.017
alone, but as an example, Well, this house is my 
brother Juan's house. I have respect for him. I

31:40.238 --> 31:41.600
know my sister lives there. I live in my little 
house. Does your brother live here too? Yes, he

31:46.285 --> 31:48.648
lives in San Juan. The other one lived there, but he 
moved there. We all lived there when my father

31:52.913 --> 31:54.815
died. Is San Juan very close? One is mine here. One 
is mine here. Ah, it's very close. Yes. And your

32:01.544 --> 32:02.626
family was here? Yes. When my father died and my 
mother, they were all there. Not together, but

32:09.755 --> 32:18.126
everyone in their

32:09.755 --> 32:18.126
house. Yes.

32:22.312 --> 32:29.822
Well, tell me about your trip to Hacienda de 
Dolores. to this other hacienda, the trip? I don't

32:34.151 --> 32:36.413
know because I don't remember. But what did your 
mother say about these things? No, my mother says

32:38.755 --> 32:41.918
that they came from there. It was my father because 
he came first to this hacienda. And he wrote to her

32:46.022 --> 32:52.769
and sent her money for food for us. So he wrote to her 
and told her to get ready because he was going to go I

33:00.413 --> 33:02.676
asked him how many days he was going. He said, are 
you ready? I said, are the girls ready? Are you

33:06.421 --> 33:08.084
ready? Well, you can bring clothes for them and for 
you. Yes. And then my father went and brought her

33:11.669 --> 33:15.033
there. Yes. To the Hacienda de Dolores. Yes. And 
his families stayed there. Yes. So my mother had

33:23.084 --> 33:25.668
her mother and my grandmother. Yes. But my 
father's mother had already passed away. Yes. In

33:30.164 --> 33:31.105
what way? In Bahia? I don't remember. I don't know. 
They didn't tell me. I think I was in Guayin because

33:37.352 --> 33:41.916
they were in Guayin. Guayin. What is a Guayin? With 
mules. Oh, with mules! But they are called

33:47.763 --> 33:50.185
Guayines. Guayines, with mules. And is it a very 
long trip? I don't know. I think it is because it is a

33:56.432 --> 33:58.534
little far. From Tamaulipas to... It's a little 
far. Yes. But now, by car, it's not very far. I think

34:09.383 --> 34:13.227
it's less than a day away. Yes, but in Guayí, it's 
quite far. I don't know where it is, but maybe in

34:15.709 --> 34:20.514
Guayí, because it was what I saw before. There were 
no cars. No, not these days. Is there enough to eat

34:25.379 --> 34:28.723
on this trip? Yes, I think so, my father had it. 
Well, he worked. Yes. And then he sowed, he had,

34:33.888 --> 34:40.340
well, how do you say, half, they gave me. Well, the 
boss gave him certain acres of land, my father

34:41.281 --> 34:49.096
cultivated them. Ajá. They sowed what they had to 
sow, what they picked up from the harvest, half for

34:50.067 --> 34:57.298
him and half for the boss. Yes, I understand. And 
what kind of houses did you have? Well, my mom used

35:02.786 --> 35:09.457
to say they were adobe houses. Adobe? Yes, adobe 
houses. My mom made some pictures like this, a

35:11.720 --> 35:15.566
little bigger. Yes. They used to beat the cement 
here, you know? Yes. But over there they beat it

35:19.849 --> 35:22.852
with dirt, with water. They made them and then they 
made the house out of pure adobe. And the floor was

35:27.176 --> 35:31.920
made of adobe. Yes. And the roof was made of straw, 
my mom says.

35:41.288 --> 35:41.869
Yes. Straw is like... There's a very big roof, 
right? Yes. And the... They put the ceilings, but

35:45.805 --> 35:48.649
the houses don't get wet. First they put only 
sticks like this. Yes. And you see how they make

35:52.195 --> 36:02.751
houses over there in the overseas,

35:52.195 --> 36:02.751
the Japanese and all that. Yes, and also in Mexico. 
Well, and they put only sticks like this, and then

36:05.255 --> 36:10.003
there they put only zakate, but well composed, 
well settled. Yes. And the houses don't get wet.

36:12.350 --> 36:18.659
They all had good houses, big ones for families.

36:19.500 --> 36:24.047
In this farm, for all the families, there were good 
houses? Yes, good houses. And the owner paid a lot?

36:27.492 --> 36:28.493
Yes, he paid them. I don't know how much he would 
earn in Mexico, I don't know, because then they

36:28.573 --> 36:36.725
paid a little. But as it was the farm, and he was a 
farmer, well, that was fine. For example, from

36:41.712 --> 36:53.809
what they sowed, they took out half, half for the 
landowner and half for the miller, for the worker.

36:55.151 --> 37:03.383
And the corn, my mother says that they soaked it in 
the mafrota, then they took it out and put it in

36:55.151 --> 37:03.383
bags, in bags. And then they came to buy it, they 
sold it, because it was pure money they had, and

37:03.403 --> 37:10.673
beans and all that. Life was good in the days before 
the war. Yes. And then when we were here in Kuala

37:16.439 --> 37:29.824
Lumpur, we never... Well,

37:16.439 --> 37:29.824
they didn't pay much, so my father would plant a 
little cotton and all that. But my father was

37:29.984 --> 37:32.509
always a man who planted. Mi mamá tenía muchas 
gallinas. ¿Sí? Muchas gallinas. ¿Aquí en qué? Sí,

37:39.815 --> 37:41.397
en Calale, en el rancho. En el otro rancho. En el 
rancho donde nació mi hermanito de chico. ¿Cómo se

37:45.001 --> 37:46.583
llama este rancho? Le decían Casa Morada. ¿Casa? 
Morada. Morada. ¿Y está cerca de aquí o no? Bueno,

37:54.052 --> 37:56.675
yo no sé cuántas meses hay aquí. Eso está al otro 
lado de Calale, el rancho ese. ¿El otro lado de?

38:01.180 --> 38:01.641
Calale. Calale. McAllen? No, Cal Allen. This 
town. Oh, Cal Allen. Yes. And was it a big ranch or

38:09.740 --> 38:11.782
small? No, they were two ranches, that gentleman. 
What was the gentleman's name? That gentleman's

38:19.569 --> 38:23.633
name was Mr. Sice. Ed Sice. Eduardo Sice. He lived 
here in Corpus Christi. Yes. That gentleman. And

38:32.345 --> 38:38.216
they lived with us and all the time they would say, 
and go. The Lord said to them. My father sowed

38:39.398 --> 38:41.882
cabbage. Yes. The time it was cabbage, he would sow 
cabbage and also with him, with the lords. Yes. And

38:49.636 --> 38:55.467
the priests would say to him, Juan, I want your 
children to go tomorrow. to cut the grass from the

38:56.392 --> 38:58.454
cabbage. I went to see him and the grass was coming 
out. He said, I want it to be very clean. I think that

39:03.638 --> 39:07.622
next week the buyer will come to treat him. How much 
does the cabbage lacquer cost? He said, because

39:13.227 --> 39:18.071
his children are very good at working. And they 
were me, Pedro my brother, and Juan my brother. The

39:23.075 --> 39:24.677
three of us. We were riding horses. Curioso. Pero 
la vida, además, antes era muy bonita. Estaba muy

39:32.772 --> 39:35.474
bonito en aquella rancho. Sí. Y yo digo que era muy 
bonita la vida de antes. Los muchachos eran muy

39:39.158 --> 39:42.321
simples, todos. Los de ahora no, ¿verdad? Los 
muchachos son muy... Vimos en ron, y nomás tomando

39:43.882 --> 39:51.429
cerveza, y ron, y los carros corriendo. Sí. Y antes 
no. Trabajaban. They would go to work and give them

39:54.796 --> 39:57.119
to their parents. My father would go to work for us. 
He would come and tell us, they are going to cut this

39:59.582 --> 40:06.411
grass, this mud, they are not going to make mud. 
They cut the grass well, very well cut. And later I

40:08.393 --> 40:10.877
would come and give them a ride. And he would take us 
food to work. Because he was retired to the other

40:14.541 --> 40:17.385
ranch where we lived. So that we wouldn't go until 
the afternoon. And he would take us food. and he was

40:25.120 --> 40:32.787
going to see the work that was not there. He would go 
back to work and later the boss would come and say,

40:32.907 --> 40:42.756
Oh Juan, your children are very good at working, 
the best children there are. Then one day Juan

40:42.816 --> 40:51.184
would say to the children, they were the middle 
ones, but he would say that the children of Juan

40:42.816 --> 40:51.184
were very good at working in the salon. The other 
one worked cleaning ...chicken, corn... ...they

40:54.584 --> 41:23.393
cut the grass... ...we sowed... ...with a small 
plow, with a mule... ...my brother... ...had four

40:54.584 --> 41:23.393
mules... ...with a disc... ...and then we... 
...we sowed with another mule... ...and a small

40:54.584 --> 41:23.393
mule... I worked all the time with the family. And 
in this ranch, did your father also have land for

41:26.713 --> 41:32.282
food, for the family? To plant? Yes. Oh, yes. Yes? 
We, my father, all the time, we never went hungry.

41:40.997 --> 41:46.226
Many people say that they lived very limited and 
that we didn't. We all the time, my father, I had a

41:49.850 --> 41:54.516
lot of animals, a lot of chickens. Your father? 
Yes, marranos that we raised. And I sold them to my

42:00.443 --> 42:02.005
mother. I would put a lot of chickens and my mother 
would gather a lot of blanquillos and my father

42:02.025 --> 42:09.915
would take them to the village of Robestán to sell. 
And from there, with almost all the blanquillos,

42:09.996 --> 42:14.501
he brought the most necessary. Yes. Because we 
had... There was sugar, coffee, butter, what we

42:17.474 --> 42:21.680
needed, beans. Not beans because we planted them 
and we always had them. But the rest that we needed

42:25.846 --> 42:29.892
for the house, coffee, sugar. We never had, we 
never got hungry. We always had a lot to eat. That's

42:34.839 --> 42:35.820
nice. And in medicine, there are plants for 
medicine too? Yes, there are medicinal plants for

42:41.148 --> 42:45.694
the stomach. My mom always planted them. It had 
grass, it had a little bush that was very good when

42:46.972 --> 42:57.450
it hurts, it's called stafiate. Stafiate, yes. It 
was rough, because it also has a very unpleasant

42:58.993 --> 43:08.209
aroma, but it's very good with a colic that it has. 
Yes. And that was my brother Juan. It had rained a

43:12.655 --> 43:35.408
lot and my mother used to water cows because the 
boss told my father, Juan, he said, all the cows

43:12.655 --> 43:35.408
that have babies, he said, you can throw the babies 
into the corral and you can water the cows, so they

43:12.655 --> 43:35.408
are taught to water them and that the babies grow 
well, they are not going to die alone in the pasture

43:12.655 --> 43:35.408
because they are very small. My father washed 
them. And my mom would order the cows and she would

43:36.500 --> 43:41.605
make cheese. Yes, cheese. White cheese. My mom 
made a lot. Yes. And in the afternoon it had rained a

43:45.529 --> 44:02.545
lot and my mom would go to the corral to put all the 
sheep here in the corral where they were locked up

43:45.529 --> 44:02.545
and the cows over there and they would put them, 
they already had the food there that my dad had,

43:45.529 --> 44:02.545
corn straws, to put them so that they would sleep 
all night. And this, how much vaccine did they give

44:04.286 --> 44:06.068
me? I was going to play, but my mom said, don't go 
because there are a lot of thorns with the rain and

44:06.588 --> 44:13.722
you can sprain your foot. She said, no, I'm not 
going to play, the water is running. And I think in

44:17.088 --> 44:23.501
the trunk, there was a mosquito and it didn't turn 
around. I think there was a viper and it bit a viper.

44:26.366 --> 44:28.410
Yes, my brother. He bit it here. Then he ran and 
said, Mom, a little animal bit me with its tail. I

44:36.700 --> 44:39.163
said, Mom, how? What animal? He said, yes, and it's 
asleep. He came to my mom, he came to my mom with a

44:41.745 --> 44:48.672
bucket of milk, and he left her at home. He said, 
don't worry, don't worry. He said, when? He said,

44:52.336 --> 44:57.100
he bit a little animal with its tail, and it brought 
a drop of blood. He said, yes, there was a viper. And

45:00.250 --> 45:21.870
then my father's boss...

45:23.757 --> 45:30.646
My father went and told him, and then the father 
came and said, let me go and bring the doctor to

45:23.757 --> 45:30.646
Rodescán. Then the doctors went out to the ranch, 
and he was very drunk, and the doctor came and

45:30.726 --> 45:38.455
brought him. And he was lying down, and he had his 
stomach like this, it got very big, the stomach,

45:38.475 --> 45:48.448
because of the poison of the diva. But he didn't cry 
and the doctor gave him panchovia. He said it was

45:52.317 --> 45:57.443
like panchovia. And he just gave him a little glass 
of water. He gave him a little powder that he had to

46:02.330 --> 46:06.455
repeat. He said, don't be afraid. He said, the 
child is not going to do anything. He just said,

46:10.600 --> 46:15.206
he's going to put a lot of gas and with pure lamp oil. 
Yes. He put it in his hands, he put it in his foot.
