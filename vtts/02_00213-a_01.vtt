1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, testing.

00:09.253 --> 00:13.299
Testing 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, testing, testing.

00:16.143 --> 00:17.785
Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. This is May the 
3rd and I have the pleasure and honor of chatting

00:21.851 --> 00:27.760
with Ricky Wood. Wood, singular, W-O-O-D. Yes, 
W-O-O-D. This year's Head Yield Leader. To begin

00:37.247 --> 00:46.299
with, Ricky, describe your background, family, 
where'd you grow up, high school, what do mom and

00:37.247 --> 00:46.299
dad do. Okay. Tell us about yourself before you 
came to Texas A&M. Okay. I was born in Houston,

00:50.785 --> 00:52.307
Texas. I lived in the same house from the day I was 
born until roughly middle of June, summer before

00:57.372 --> 01:03.231
my senior year in high school, so roughly 18 years, 
lived in the same house. I have an older brother and

01:03.492 --> 01:05.198
a younger sister. My older brother went to the 
University of Virginia on a full academic

01:05.258 --> 01:09.913
scholarship. My younger sister is a freshman in 
high school at the moment, and she has aspirations

01:10.332 --> 01:18.400
of A&M just simply because of what she's gotten to 
see through me the last couple years, which is

01:10.332 --> 01:18.400
really neat. I'm excited about that. I went to the 
same school. I went to the Second Baptist School

01:22.524 --> 01:28.689
for 14 years, pre-kindergarten all the way 
through my senior year of high school. So I went to

01:29.270 --> 01:36.677
school with the same – there was about 13 of us that 
went to school from the day that we started there

01:29.270 --> 01:36.677
until we graduated – Both my parents went to 
college and they both went to law school. They both

01:41.223 --> 01:47.912
attended undergrad at Rice University, 
graduated I think in 68 or 69 and then went to

01:41.223 --> 01:47.912
University of Texas Law School. Graduated there 
in 72. Moved to Houston, both got jobs in law firms

01:50.836 --> 01:55.222
in 1980. My mom got appointed to be a judge in 
Houston. And then in 82, she lost her reelection,

01:59.506 --> 02:05.113
ran for something else in 84, and has been a judge 
ever since. In Houston, my dad in 1991 got

02:05.714 --> 02:10.280
appointed to be a judge in Houston. And so both my 
parents are now judges in the Harris County area.

02:14.024 --> 02:15.326
My mom is a state district judge. My father is a 
probate judge there in the Houston area. Why did

02:21.634 --> 02:23.016
you attend A&M? What led you to be interested here? 
I came to A&M. For a couple reasons. One, I remember

02:27.474 --> 02:30.778
my sophomore year, I was very, very involved in 
football. I was about 70 pounds bigger than what

02:31.399 --> 02:34.643
you see now. Just because I just worked out a lot and 
I was just much bigger, just, I mean, bigger in all

02:35.444 --> 02:42.533
ways, in all sense of the word. And so football was 
what I was going to do. I was being relatively

02:46.958 --> 02:49.201
highly recruited. Even right, like my sophomore 
year, places were contacting me to come to their

02:49.241 --> 02:54.387
football games and stuff like that. But my 
sophomore year during the football season, a

02:55.092 --> 03:00.359
friend of mine's older sister was a freshman at 
A&M. And so one weekend where we didn't have a

03:01.100 --> 03:08.409
football game, he said, do you want to go up to A&M 
and just stay the weekend and we can go have fun with

03:01.100 --> 03:08.409
my sister and all that kind of stuff. I said, I don't 
have anything else to do. So we came. We came up

03:11.032 --> 03:11.553
here. We went to Midnight Yale practice. Very 
similar story that I'm sure you've heard many

03:14.016 --> 03:15.999
times. We went to Midnight Yale practice. We went 
back and We stayed in Mosier Hall when we shouldn't

03:19.730 --> 03:25.379
have as sophomores, well I was a sophomore and he 
was a junior. In high school we ended up staying in

03:25.900 --> 03:30.667
an all girls dorm, which was really fun. Just being 
able to live the college life I guess. You can say we

03:34.734 --> 03:41.164
went out somewhere Saturday, we went to a game 
Saturday night, we went out again. I was very, very

03:41.701 --> 03:46.396
impressed by the close-knit atmosphere here at 
A&M. I was very, very impressed by Yale practice,

03:46.878 --> 03:48.663
obviously. That was something where I just said, 
oh my gosh, this is completely different than

03:48.683 --> 03:52.957
anything I've seen. I mean, my brother was at 
University of Virginia. And I had gone up and

03:55.471 --> 03:58.975
visited him fall semester of my sophomore year as 
well. And it was just very different. I mean, just

04:01.077 --> 04:02.459
very different feels. Even though there's a lot of 
similarities between A&M and University of

04:02.979 --> 04:09.366
Virginia, there was something that defined A&M as 
separate. And I think most of us know what that is.

04:11.929 --> 04:17.255
And so then once my senior year, junior year came 
around and I started applying to schools, I

04:11.929 --> 04:17.255
applied to three schools. I applied to Dartmouth, 
Columbia, and then A&M. I applied to Dartmouth and

04:20.338 --> 04:22.120
Columbia to play football. And I applied to A&M 
because I was in top 10%. I had really good ACT

04:26.629 --> 04:28.074
scores. I knew I could get in just not a problem. And 
so I applied. September got my acceptance letter,

04:32.883 --> 04:43.739
end of October, and didn't really make the 
decision to come here until April or so, simply

04:32.883 --> 04:43.739
because I realized that this is where I needed to 
be. None of the football stuff had panned out, and

04:45.441 --> 04:56.077
so I was just like, okay, Lord, I'm just gonna go 
where you have, where the door's open, and so I came

04:45.441 --> 04:56.077
here, and it was, yeah. Did you go to fish camp? I did 
go to fish camp. Describe it as you would. It was

05:01.705 --> 05:04.950
amazing, actually. I absolutely loved Fish Camp 
because I came from such a small high school. It's

05:08.615 --> 05:10.698
not that I wasn't used to dealing with numbers. I 
mean, with my parents being involved in what they

05:11.059 --> 05:14.924
were, I was always used to being in big groups. I was 
always used to having to be at the forefront as far

05:15.345 --> 05:24.338
as my personality, having to be forthright in how I 
speak to people and not waiting for them to speak to

05:15.345 --> 05:24.338
me, but me speak to them. So it's not that I was 
embarrassed per se, but of course I got there and I

05:24.318 --> 05:32.770
was wearing the wrong thing just because it was 
summer in Texas. I didn't necessarily bring the

05:33.651 --> 05:36.315
right clothes. I mean it was just one of those 
things where I didn't really know anyone and so I

05:36.515 --> 05:40.301
just came by myself. I ended up having an amazing 
time. My DG leaders were great. I got back to A&M,

05:44.046 --> 05:52.738
went home for four days, packed up, moved up here, 
and then spent the next three weeks hanging out

05:44.046 --> 05:52.738
with my DG group almost every day. And that was very 
important in the transition simply because these

05:53.140 --> 06:01.062
were people that I hadn't met before and already I 
felt like I was part of communities. You're saying

06:01.102 --> 06:02.065
DG. DG in fish camp. Within each camp that you go to, 
there's sessions, six sessions. Within the

06:07.907 --> 06:09.329
sessions, there's six camps. And then within 
those camps, there's discussion groups, which

06:09.950 --> 06:14.355
range from eight to 13 people. In charge of each 
discussion group are a male and a female. So DG,

06:18.380 --> 06:20.202
that's what I mean by DG. Did fish camp have an 
effect on you and others in terms of spirit,

06:21.603 --> 06:28.512
devotion? Oh, definitely. Definitely. As you 
look back on it now, How comparatively accurate

06:33.725 --> 06:38.189
was Fish Camp in previewing A&M? Well, it depends 
on what you're talking about. If you're talking

06:41.432 --> 06:44.495
about campus life, I mean, there's no way. We're in 
Lakeview. We're at a camp. I mean, it can't really

06:45.937 --> 06:47.398
depict. But as far as the stuff that they gave you 
just as advice, I think it was very accurate. The

06:52.083 --> 06:59.930
stuff that they tried, I think Fish Camp has a 
really good way of... And this is why I'm still

06:52.083 --> 06:59.930
involved to this day as a co-chair. It has a very 
good way of...

07:06.175 --> 07:08.880
keeping the myth of A&M going, if that makes any 
sense. Myth might be the wrong word, maybe the

07:08.940 --> 07:10.624
aura. I'm having trouble thinking of the right 
word, just simply because these freshmen coming

07:11.305 --> 07:21.906
here, even those that parents and grandparents 
and great-grandparents might have come to A&M,

07:11.305 --> 07:21.906
they would still not know what it is really like. 
And so they come in, they feel it, they see what it's

07:23.351 --> 07:25.496
like. So then they come to, they start the school 
year already embedded with those things that, you

07:25.897 --> 07:34.276
know, maybe a senior doesn't have anymore simply 
because they've been here for so long. But it was a

07:34.296 --> 07:36.321
good preparation. It was an amazing preparation 
just simply because got there, got to meet people

07:39.588 --> 07:42.151
that had been involved in different stuff. You 
weren't supposed to talk about involvements, but

07:42.712 --> 07:45.155
it was very obvious that there were. 
Presentations were made by people on campus, the

07:45.395 --> 07:50.141
Yale Leaders Bonfire, Red Pots, stuff like that, 
they all came. It was just, it was really, really

07:50.201 --> 07:52.564
neat. When you came then back to campus to stay, how 
did you get here, what did you bring, what kind of

07:54.006 --> 08:02.676
gear and stuff? I came I remember it. We brought two 
cars. I brought my car and then my parents. And I

08:09.644 --> 08:11.927
remember I had a computer, some clothes. I 
remember my parents were really big on making sure

08:12.648 --> 08:16.232
I was as comfortable as possible. And so we went to 
Sam's and bought two $20 bookcases because I

08:16.713 --> 08:22.240
stayed in Kane Hall. My roommate was on the 
football team for my high school, and so I got to be

08:23.101 --> 08:30.351
his roommate in Kane Hall my freshman year, which 
was really neat. Moved in, and I remember he had

08:31.141 --> 08:35.385
already been there because of two-a-days. He had 
been there for a while, and that's why I came up

08:35.445 --> 08:40.230
early, because he was really lonely and didn't 
really have anyone to talk to. So I came up to hang

08:40.951 --> 08:44.835
out with him and moved into the dorm. I remember 
Luby's was a favorite place to eat of my family

08:44.895 --> 08:58.149
growing up, and so we went to Luby's one last time, 
and then parking lot of Luby's, Dad shook my hand,

08:44.895 --> 08:58.149
Mom kissed me on the cheek and said, have a good 
time, and then they'd go off. Did they give you any

08:58.389 --> 09:00.051
other advice? Um, not really, to be honest with 
you. Um, they gave me some, just, I mean, just the, I

09:05.265 --> 09:17.862
like to think of it in the Hamlet terms of things, be 
true to yourself, be first to listen, not first to

09:05.265 --> 09:17.862
speak, stuff like that. Just kind of general 
sentiments on how to live your life, but not

09:18.383 --> 09:22.949
necessarily... What about this UVA older 
brother? Did he give you any advice or counsel?

09:25.293 --> 09:25.633
Um... little bit he said make sure and pour into 
relationships both same-sex and obviously other

09:26.187 --> 09:47.622
relationships as far as with women but also said 
make sure and pour into your same-sex

09:26.187 --> 09:47.622
relationships that was his biggest one all right 
so you're over in Kane Hall did Joel Was there any

09:48.226 --> 09:52.653
kind of ritual or routine or tradition? 
Unfortunately, no. And that's always something

09:54.296 --> 10:02.109
that I've looked back that I wish I could have had, 
that I wish I could have lived in the dorms, maybe on

09:54.296 --> 10:02.109
South Side or maybe one on North Side that was much 
more rich in tradition. Kane Hall was, it wasn't at

10:03.071 --> 10:05.295
all. Kane Hall was comprised of people freshmen 
who wanted a really big dorm and so they got in and

10:08.240 --> 10:26.383
they got in early so the so the and i don't want to say 
intelligence level but the grades and maybe the

10:08.240 --> 10:26.383
way in which academics was viewed was a little 
better of the people that weren't in sports in kane

10:08.240 --> 10:26.383
simply because you couldn't get in there unless 
you applied really early and you got in really

10:08.240 --> 10:26.383
early and athletes, and the athletes just 
couldn't care anything about A&M necessarily. I

10:32.456 --> 10:39.585
mean, they care about A&M, but they don't care 
about A&M the same way in which maybe I do or someone

10:32.456 --> 10:39.585
else who cares a lot about the spirit and the 
integrity of the institution. Where did you eat? I

10:42.788 --> 10:44.590
ate there in King, which was great. Describe the 
routine of the dining hall there. Well, I remember

10:48.155 --> 10:54.923
as a freshman, depending on if my roommate was 
there, I wasn't great friends, especially in the

10:48.155 --> 10:54.923
fall, I wasn't great friends with anyone 
necessarily in my dorm. And there was really no

10:55.183 --> 10:57.045
ways to get friends within the dorm except maybe if 
you just hung out in the hallway which I didn't

10:57.143 --> 11:22.324
really like but that's just I think that's just the 
nature of Kane Hall and so right about dinner time

10:57.143 --> 11:22.324
you'd walk down there with your ID and there'd be a 
big long line at the front door and you'd scan it and

10:57.143 --> 11:22.324
then you'd go in and you wait in line and I remember 
seeing all the football players and all the

10:57.143 --> 11:22.324
athletes that I knew and all this kind of stuff and I 
just I remember being just kind of wide-eyed and a

10:57.143 --> 11:22.324
total freshman and then I'd get my get my food and go 
sit down at the table either by myself or if I

11:22.692 --> 11:28.121
recognized a face and I'd go sit down with him and 
stuff. But Cain Hall was very hard socially simply

11:28.521 --> 11:33.630
because athletes hung out with athletes. Those 
that didn't hang out with athletes, they had their

11:34.291 --> 11:36.815
own friends. Maybe he was within the dorm and stuff 
like that. And your roommate was an athlete? My

11:42.103 --> 11:44.347
roommate was an athlete, but he was a walk-on 
athlete. He was a recruited walk-on, so he wasn't

11:44.367 --> 11:47.552
on the same level as... the highly recruited 
people. So how did you make some friends that first

11:49.700 --> 11:52.703
semester? I went out for an organization called 
Aggie Men's Club. Now, I don't know if you've heard

11:56.046 --> 12:03.892
about it or not, but Aggie Men's Club was an 
organization started in 1984 by some people who

11:56.046 --> 12:03.892
were very upset with the Greek system here on 
campus. They thought that it was just dumb and it

12:03.912 --> 12:08.576
wasn't fulfilling and it was fake relationships 
and stuff. Which I don't, I'm not saying that's the

12:09.357 --> 12:14.021
case with all Greek fraternities, but I'm just 
saying that is the reason that this was made. And

12:15.282 --> 12:17.404
what it is, is it's kind of a It's it's a selections. 
I mean, it's a selectionary group. And so you know

12:21.513 --> 12:23.855
one can't not everybody can get in it. It's got a 
It's got a limit of a hundred guys that can be in at a

12:24.235 --> 12:41.972
time and you go out you go through selections 
process and if you get in you get in it's a social

12:24.235 --> 12:41.972
service group is essentially what it is really 
intent on brotherhood really intent on Good true

12:24.235 --> 12:41.972
male relationships male friendships. Where does 
it meet? It meets in different places, you know

12:43.394 --> 12:46.817
simply because we aren't Greek and And our dues 
aren't that much. We don't have a necessary place

12:49.267 --> 12:52.911
to meet every week. It's kind of whatever room we 
can find on campus. We've been meeting in Blocker a

12:55.053 --> 12:56.735
lot lately. Yeah. Alright, how did you get, how did 
you get acquainted with Aggie lingo, slang, like

12:59.218 --> 13:12.091
you all didn't use dining hall nicknames for food, 
did you? No, no we did not. No, we did not. But did

13:15.086 --> 13:20.799
you, as a freshman, did you start going to Yale 
practice? Oh, yes, sir. I didn't miss a Yale

13:22.062 --> 13:23.906
practice my freshman year. I didn't miss a 
football game. Every second, I tried out for fish

13:26.111 --> 13:30.962
camp, and I got fish camp counselor. my freshman 
year and so right off the bat I was just involved

13:31.347 --> 13:35.974
with a group of people that was very A&M oriented. I 
was in early session and so there were some people

13:37.076 --> 13:42.084
that were in the Corp of Cadets in my fish camp. 
There were people in the Corp of Cadets in Aggie

13:42.104 --> 13:46.470
Men's Club when I first got in it as a freshman. So 
they were people that obviously just integrated

13:47.111 --> 13:52.039
me into what it was to be an Aggie. I went to all that 
stuff, and I got in. I had friends that were very

13:55.285 --> 13:57.227
involved in other things. So just hanging around 
them, going to Southside dorms, going to the

13:57.648 --> 14:07.359
Northside dorms, eating in Sabisa with my 
friends, you just kind of learned it, even though I

13:57.648 --> 14:07.359
didn't necessarily experience it firsthand. I 
went out to Bonfire. I worked on Bonfire. I built

14:09.802 --> 14:10.923
Bonfire, stuff like that. When Bonfire, your 
freshman year, which would have been the fall of?

14:14.968 --> 14:15.568
97. 97. About when did you begin work on Bonfire? 
First cut. I went out to the first cut. When was

14:22.458 --> 14:24.262
that? October 13th. Okay. Something like that. So 
five or six weeks before. Yes, five or six weeks.

14:31.802 --> 14:32.924
About how far from the camp? Where was the first 
cut? It was out in Snook. If you went... Beyond the

14:37.257 --> 14:37.878
river? Yes, on the other side of the river. I went 
out there, and I remember I went with some of my

14:40.000 --> 14:42.563
friends. I went with Aggie Men's Club, and I 
remember we cut with Dunn Hall. That's who we went

14:46.567 --> 14:47.509
out there with. What did you used to cut with? An 
axe, and then we made our own pot, and we had to make

14:49.190 --> 15:00.303
our own pot, and they were... We just went out there 
with an axe, and I remember we just stayed out there

14:49.190 --> 15:00.303
until about 7 o'clock at night and just had an 
absolutely amazing time. How long did you work on

15:00.323 --> 15:01.885
it? How long did I work on bonfire or cut that day? On 
bonfire? All that semester. Oh, okay. That whole

15:08.377 --> 15:09.078
semester. Did you go out once a day or once a week? 
Oh, no, no, no, maybe once a week. I definitely went

15:13.286 --> 15:16.952
to the cuts and then I went to snack maybe once or 
twice a week. Do you remember going to your first

15:17.754 --> 15:22.342
silver taps? Yes. What was it like? Ominous, 
honestly. Much bigger than anything I could have

15:27.299 --> 15:29.323
imagined. I mean, obviously, we got shown it at 
fish camp. But it was kind of a reality check, if you

15:32.849 --> 15:47.616
want to put it that way, simply because not only was 
I made aware of what A&M was like and just the ways in

15:32.849 --> 15:47.616
which we were set apart just as far as our school, 
but also... Oh, I just became very aware of

15:48.558 --> 15:52.284
mortality, I guess. Just because something, 
especially as an upper teen male, that's

15:52.865 --> 15:57.993
something you never think about. You know, you 
never think about the consequences of stuff. And I

16:00.798 --> 16:05.846
remember one of the first silver tufts was someone 
who just got in a car wreck, you know, driving home

16:00.798 --> 16:05.846
or something. And so I just became very aware, I 
guess, of myself, which was a great learning

16:06.507 --> 16:11.916
experience. All right, now let's go to academics. 
What was your major as you arrived? General

16:17.891 --> 16:18.573
studies. It was general studies. What did you 
think you might end up doing professionally in the

16:19.976 --> 16:25.247
future? I didn't know. You didn't have any clue. I 
didn't have any clue. I had such a wide range of

16:28.355 --> 16:31.902
interests. And it's still that way. Even though 
I'm a certain major, that doesn't mean what it is. I

16:36.090 --> 16:37.913
came as a general studies major. I just took all 
just the prereq courses. I knew I didn't want to do

16:40.558 --> 16:41.801
engineering. I remember going to my advisor. and 
being like, okay, what classes should I take? And I

16:46.488 --> 16:47.950
was in the honors program when I came in. And what 
classes do you want to take? I said, I don't know.

16:51.895 --> 16:52.997
And she's like, what do you want to do? I said, oh, 
gosh, I don't know. I was just all stressed out as a

16:54.279 --> 16:56.181
freshman. And she was like, well, let's do this. 
She was like, do you want to be a doctor? I said, no.

16:59.466 --> 17:00.567
She was like, do you want to be an engineer? I said, 
no. She's like, well, that takes out two very big

17:01.769 --> 17:03.912
things. And so we know nothing really in science, 
and we know nothing really in engineering

17:03.952 --> 17:06.936
classes. So that helped out a lot. So I came in as a 
general studies major. And was the advising, as

17:14.131 --> 17:18.583
you began, was it good? Oh, it was wonderful. Her 
name was Wanda Watson, and I'll always remember. I

17:22.113 --> 17:24.139
remember I'd go in and speak with her maybe once 
every two weeks. Describe your first impressions

17:25.262 --> 17:29.895
of going to class at A&M. First impressions of 
going to class. My first class, my first class was a

17:32.480 --> 17:35.024
Monday morning. I remember this perfectly. My 
first class was a Monday morning at 910 and it was in

17:36.847 --> 17:39.492
Halbooty. It was geology 101 with a man named Mr. 
Koenig. He doesn't work here anymore. He retired

17:44.501 --> 17:47.647
after my freshman year, fall of my freshman year. 
And I remember walking in. It was a big lecture

17:50.372 --> 17:51.414
class. And I remember just being completely It was 
really hard simply because I went in there, none of

17:55.930 --> 18:01.436
my friends were in there, and so I sat by myself. And 
then I remember seeing a big group of core guys walk

18:02.577 --> 18:05.481
in. And then I remember seeing like four guys walk 
in that had Greek shirts on. They were wearing

18:10.046 --> 18:11.407
their Greek letters. And I remember just going, 
wow, I was like they're really involved in

18:11.988 --> 18:15.973
something. And Aggie Men's Club hadn't started at 
that point. But I remember thinking to myself,

18:19.623 --> 18:23.208
wow, this place is really big. It was much 
different than my high school simply because the

18:23.948 --> 18:29.055
most people I had in a classroom in high school was 
34. I was sitting here in a 300-person lecture hall

18:29.415 --> 18:32.720
that was completely jam-packed. And I remember 
him walking in and saying the requirements of the

18:33.681 --> 18:40.670
course, and I remember just being like, okay, I 
guess this is school. This is college. I guess this

18:42.832 --> 18:44.254
is why we're here. I remember it was a little 
overwhelming. Do you remember what your course

18:46.994 --> 18:50.819
load was that first semester? I took 16 hours. 16. 
And what were your personal guidelines for class?

19:00.531 --> 19:02.193
Was it to go to class every day? I tried to go to class 
every single day simply because my brother told me

19:02.233 --> 19:13.086
this, people had come to A&M, my older friends, 
they were like, if you go to class, your grade will

19:02.233 --> 19:13.086
be a letter grade higher than it would otherwise. 
simply because you aren't going to have to study as

19:13.066 --> 19:18.960
much, just because you'll have the material 
presented to you rather than you having to learn

19:13.066 --> 19:18.960
about yourself. Alright, then describe, once you 
get into the routine, describe a typical class

19:19.280 --> 19:25.254
day. What time did you get up and what did you do 
when? One of the requirements of Aggie Men's Club

19:30.160 --> 19:34.007
is you have to do interviews with all the actors. 
You have to go out and interview them, and then you

19:34.087 --> 19:39.196
have a book that you made when you got in. And they 
don't take just freshmen. I think I was one of six

19:41.560 --> 19:44.085
freshmen that got in that year. out for selections 
that year and so I was one of the only freshmen well

19:46.748 --> 20:12.368
one of six freshmen and so pretty much the day would 
wake up I'd look at my schedule to see if I had an

19:46.748 --> 20:12.368
interview that day or not just because you don't 
miss interviews I mean one thing that I really

19:46.748 --> 20:12.368
enjoyed about Aggie Men's Club is that there were 
definite rules that you had to go by they weren't

19:46.748 --> 20:12.368
you couldn't say well today you know what I can't do 
it you had to do it there were certain things that

19:46.748 --> 20:12.368
you had to do and I really enjoyed that about It gave 
you discipline that I wouldn't have gotten

20:12.719 --> 20:19.732
otherwise, simply because I wasn't only dealing 
with my schedule, but I had to deal with other

20:12.719 --> 20:19.732
people's schedule. So that taught me a lot right 
then. But I'd wake up, check my schedule, maybe 45

20:22.437 --> 20:27.286
minutes before my first class. I'd shower, go down 
and get something to eat, walk to class. I think I

20:31.636 --> 20:33.439
had two classes in the morning. Then I'd go to the 
12th Man in the MSC, which is kind of the cafeteria

20:33.559 --> 20:41.812
there, because that's where all my friends went to 
eat. And so I wouldn't eat in Kane. I would eat in the

20:44.115 --> 20:47.461
12th Man simply because that's where my friends 
were. Aggie Bucks was good. Aggie Bucks was good,

20:48.342 --> 20:49.684
yes, sir. This was before outbound. But Aggie 
Bucks was good. Aggie Bucks worked. And so I would

20:54.111 --> 20:56.715
go and hang out there. And then I would go back to my 
room and my roommate would be there and we'd play

20:57.202 --> 21:01.829
Nintendo for a while. And then I'd go to another 
class. I'm chuckling because can you imagine

21:04.834 --> 21:10.903
somebody 50 years ago and they'd say, what's that? 
Nintendo, excuse me, what's that? A game, I'd go

21:12.826 --> 21:14.949
play video games in my room. And then depending on 
if I had anything that week, I would try and read a

21:15.610 --> 21:24.324
little bit just to stay up, but it wouldn't 
necessarily be a priority. My problem is growing

21:24.504 --> 21:25.926
up, I never had to study very hard. I'd pick stuff up 
very fast. I would always be in trouble in

21:33.055 --> 21:38.382
elementary school, and I have to describe this to 
my girlfriend all the time. She's like, why were

21:38.402 --> 21:39.683
you always in trouble? And I was like, because I 
would learn something the first time around. And

21:43.148 --> 21:49.215
so whereas it would take two weeks to teach long 
division to my classmates, I'd get it on the first

21:43.148 --> 21:49.215
day, and then I'd be bored. And so of course, then 
I'd just do this. A little mystic. I'd just do stuff

21:52.800 --> 21:54.462
like this. Alright, in the afternoon, did you go 
back to your room to study? Um, sometimes.

22:02.257 --> 22:03.281
Sometimes I'd go to my room. Sometimes I would go to 
something called the browsing library. I don't

22:06.001 --> 22:07.023
know if you've heard about that. That was really 
neat simply because you got to listen to music. I'm

22:10.227 --> 22:11.289
a multitasker. I can't sit in a quiet room and 
study. I have to have other stuff going on. So

22:15.034 --> 22:30.677
whether I was going to study, maybe go to a coffee 
shop like Sweet E. Jeans or Barnes & Noble or

22:15.034 --> 22:30.677
something like that where there would be other 
stuff that while I was studying would kind of drown

22:15.034 --> 22:30.677
out some of my thoughts, I guess, because that's 
the thing that keeps me from studying the most. All

22:31.038 --> 22:33.882
right, then the evening meal where probably?

22:36.815 --> 22:38.276
during weeknights, where would you? It really 
depended. Usually I'd go over to Southside or

22:40.178 --> 22:43.862
Northside and hang out with my friends that lived 
in the dorms. Or sometimes, I remember I got a

22:44.783 --> 22:52.811
girlfriend beginning of, right in the middle of my 
freshman year, right in the middle of the fall of my

22:44.783 --> 22:52.811
freshman year. So I spent a lot of time over at her 
dorm, spent a lot of time hanging out with her

22:53.371 --> 23:06.484
friends and my friends, going off campus, going to 
houses, going to Bible studies, going to praise

22:53.371 --> 23:06.484
and worship sessions, going to parties, stuff 
like that.

23:06.616 --> 23:12.406
During that first semester, how did you and your 
family back home, how did you stay in contact with

23:06.616 --> 23:12.406
parents? Um, calling cards. Okay. Did you write 
any letters? Um, no. Well, I mean every once in a

23:18.135 --> 23:20.118
while we'd write a letter. Um, and every once in a 
while we'd write an email. This was right when

23:22.422 --> 23:24.606
email was becoming the thing. Um, this was right 
before it. And cell phones still, obviously no one

23:26.549 --> 23:29.293
had cell phones at this point. Um, but... Didn't 
really write letters. Calling was a big part of it.

23:34.323 --> 23:35.324
I mean, we'd call. Obviously, we had an answering 
machine. I'd get home, and my mom would be like,

23:36.446 --> 23:38.468
well, how are you? How are things going? And so I'd 
call them back, and we'd just talk for a little bit

23:39.509 --> 23:42.293
then. All right. And that first, say, 
mid-semester, as you first got tests back, how did

23:42.914 --> 23:48.701
things go? They went well, honestly. The classes 
that I were involved in were... stuff in which it

23:53.967 --> 23:56.370
kind of built off what I had already learned. My 
memory is such that if I learn something, I'm going

23:57.131 --> 24:03.741
to keep it with me, and so my geology class was 
really just like my eighth-grader science class.

24:04.161 --> 24:12.013
So I really didn't have to study for that that much, 
which was really exciting to me simply because my

24:04.161 --> 24:12.013
first semester wasn't one that just came in and my 
head just got blown off me. It was one in which it was

24:12.573 --> 24:22.287
just kind of a, I guess, an interim process, a 
learning process to what college studying would

24:12.573 --> 24:22.287
be like, but the classes weren't all that 
extremely difficult. And how did you, what did you

24:22.891 --> 24:25.294
wear to class? How did you dress? It depended, 
honestly. At the very beginning I dressed nice,

24:28.537 --> 24:36.406
but then by the end of the semester I was wearing 
pajama pants and t-shirts and I was rollerblading

24:28.537 --> 24:36.406
to class and stuff like that. And so it kind of 
depended on what was going on after class. And did

24:39.189 --> 24:41.832
you get a haircut regularly? No, not my first 
semester freshman year. I did not. It just kind of

24:44.935 --> 24:46.317
went. It was never this long. But for me, my head was 
buzzed all throughout high school. And so, I

24:51.829 --> 24:53.692
remember letting it grow. And you went to all the 
football games. What other campus activities did

24:58.299 --> 25:03.987
you get involved in early? Campus activities. um 
bonfire and bonfire silver taps uh and the aggie

25:06.378 --> 25:29.989
now what's the aggie men's club does it have a place 
a formal place to meet um no it doesn't like we don't

25:06.378 --> 25:29.989
have a house or anything i mean obviously we'd have 
meeting i had a meeting once a week so that's

25:06.378 --> 25:29.989
something i'd get involved in a lot we would have 
then we would have prayer meetings that of course i

25:06.378 --> 25:29.989
would go to um My fish camp would still hang out a 
lot, and so I'd do some of that. But as far as campus

25:34.417 --> 25:38.881
activities, there wasn't a campus ritual or 
anything. There isn't near the stuff I have now.

25:41.784 --> 25:44.406
We've gotten to the point where now, once a week, 
it's stuff that we go do. There's always stuff to be

25:44.586 --> 25:46.287
done on every day. During that freshman first 
semester, did you make some friends that you now

25:47.809 --> 25:54.815
look back on as dear friends? Yes, most 
definitely. Oh, yeah. There's friendships that I

25:57.457 --> 26:01.360
made that first semester that I'm going to have for 
the rest of my life. Without a doubt. And did you

26:02.920 --> 26:06.506
make any long excursions anywhere during that? 
Actually, yes, I did. Maybe not the first

26:07.989 --> 26:13.419
semester, but spring break, my friend and I, we 
were just like, well, what are we going to do? We

26:13.479 --> 26:14.701
don't know what we're going to do for spring break. 
So we drove from here to Virginia and stayed with my

26:14.721 --> 26:19.630
brother for spring break. I mean, big time road 
trip. It was awesome. A whole lot of fun. At the

26:22.876 --> 26:24.158
university. you were on the grounds. You're aware 
that you don't refer to that as a campus. Oh, of

26:30.653 --> 26:31.294
course not. It's the grounds. And you don't ask. 
And I was visiting my fourth year, my first year

26:32.697 --> 26:34.862
brother. And you don't ask someone what class they 
were in. When were you on the grounds? When were you

26:40.795 --> 26:41.576
on the grounds? Oh, sure. Oh yeah, they got their 
own stuff going there, which was neat. It was so

26:46.575 --> 26:47.256
much fun. Trivia for you. Southern history is my 
thing, and I was doing research there about 40

26:49.659 --> 26:53.946
years ago. They were restoring the room on the west 
lawn where Edgar Allan Poe was living when they

26:53.966 --> 27:03.721
suspended him for what we today call substance 
abuse. They opened up with a grand opening and all

27:04.402 --> 27:07.467
this. Someone had written in red drippy paint, 
inside the word never more. Somebody had slipped

27:16.287 --> 27:17.608
in. That's great. And only there. Financially, 
were you on tight funding or? I got an allowance,

27:28.520 --> 27:31.743
and so that was relatively tight funding. 
Probably not the same as someone who's putting

27:32.664 --> 27:36.568
their way through college. It was tight for me. I 
mean, I was living on about $150 a month,

27:38.556 --> 27:51.587
which wasn't, I mean, that's a lot of money, don't 
get me wrong, but when you take into account going

27:38.556 --> 27:51.587
out to eat, I'm so sorry. No way. Going out to eat and 
stuff like that. Where did, that first semester,

27:55.530 --> 28:02.196
where did you go, if you were really going to have a 
special meal, where would you go? Cafe XL. Cafe XL,

28:03.557 --> 28:04.798
okay. Yeah, that was the one where everybody 
talked about. That's where you go for a good meal.

28:09.043 --> 28:14.972
And then if you and your buddies were going to have a 
big time on Friday or Saturday night, where would

28:09.043 --> 28:14.972
you go?

28:18.737 --> 28:19.218
Freebirds. Honestly, Freebirds, I ate at 
Freebirds a whole lot. I didn't go out as far as

28:23.565 --> 28:29.674
drinking or stuff like that a lot my freshman year 
simply because One, I was young. I couldn't do it

28:31.972 --> 28:36.459
simply because of age and simply because of my 
parents. Breaking the law wasn't something that I

28:37.201 --> 28:42.430
did very easily simply because of the way in which I 
was raised. And so I didn't do a lot of that.

28:47.255 --> 28:48.960
Yeah, I just go out to free birds and we go to the 
house. In the years you've been here, how often

28:48.980 --> 28:58.786
have you observed Aggie, underage Aggies, 
deliberately violating the laws about alcohol? A

28:59.067 --> 28:59.428
lot. A lot. Oh yeah, ever since my freshman year. 
There was a lot more than just alcohol down in Kane

29:02.476 --> 29:06.241
Hall. I remember after football games people 
would just walk in with kegs and just put them right

29:06.722 --> 29:11.328
there in the hallway. And your guess, would Kane 
Hall be worse at that than other dorms? Yes, simply

29:17.517 --> 29:20.921
because they don't follow the same regulations 
as, let's say, RHA. They answer the athletic

29:21.783 --> 29:23.164
department. I was vice president of Kane Hall my 
freshman year. And so I'd go to RHA meetings, and

29:27.535 --> 29:34.802
they really didn't even look at us as a dorm on 
campus, simply because we didn't do the same

29:27.535 --> 29:34.802
things they did. The same rules didn't apply to us, 
simply because Kane was athletic. Now, I'm

29:41.909 --> 29:46.394
assuming that Kane Hall didn't have the good bull 
pranks that the core dorms had. No, they didn't,

29:46.414 --> 29:47.975
unfortunately. Was it a quiet place? No, it wasn't 
a quiet place. It was loud for different, the

29:53.337 --> 29:55.500
athletes were very loud. Obviously they never 
studied, they partied a whole lot. So every night

29:58.603 --> 30:02.728
of the week, I remember the hallway that I lived on. 
The first four rooms down here was all

30:03.229 --> 30:06.293
non-athletes. The next four rooms down there were 
all athletes. And that side of the hallway always

30:08.455 --> 30:11.799
had smoke coming out of the rooms. It was 
definitely the party place. And my floor was too.

30:16.717 --> 30:20.281
It was the big, the big party room was on my floor. 
When did you first see Yale leaders? When did you

30:25.066 --> 30:25.967
first? My sophomore year. But the first time that, 
I remember I came to my new student conference. And

30:31.933 --> 30:34.195
the Yale leaders do their thing there. They just 
give a traditions talk. And I remember my mom

30:36.637 --> 30:39.520
going, that looks like a lot of fun. She's like, 
those are really neat guys. And I was like, yeah,

30:42.343 --> 30:43.324
that'd be really fun.

30:49.514 --> 30:55.362
Because I'm assuming in high school that was not a 
big deal at your... No, no, no, no, no. No, we had

30:55.422 --> 30:57.865
cheerleaders at my high school. Did you perhaps 
file away in your gizzard? Wanting? Oh, sure. Most

31:04.213 --> 31:04.994
definitely I did. I did that my sophomore year. I 
remember doing that. I remember driving home and

31:07.777 --> 31:09.460
my friend and I were talking. I was like, man, just 
because the head yell leader that year, his name

31:09.480 --> 31:12.684
was Chris Torn. No, no, no. Scott Torn, and his 
father owns Camp Ozark, and I went to Camp Ozark as a

31:14.894 --> 31:21.964
child, and then went to Episcopal High School in 
Houston. And so I remember seeing him and

31:22.685 --> 31:31.238
recognizing him as Sam Torn's son, and then coming 
up to A&M and seeing him as the head yell leader,

31:22.685 --> 31:31.238
just being like, oh, I know him, you know? And so 
that being, I remember.
