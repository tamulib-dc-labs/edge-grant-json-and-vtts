WEBVTT

00:02.191 --> 00:07.396
Yeah, one or two student body presence before me was involved in fish camp and some other activities.

00:07.416 --> 00:10.559
So, you know, it's really varied.

00:12.581 --> 00:21.589
What I think drove me to do some of that was understanding the size and the complications of running something like that.

00:22.110 --> 00:23.611
And two, it's representing students.

00:24.452 --> 00:28.816
You don't necessarily have to have been in student government to represent students.

00:28.836 --> 00:30.898
And I know that sounds kind of ironic, but

00:30.878 --> 00:34.963
It has a thousand, there's about a thousand people in student government or a little bit over.

00:35.584 --> 00:43.294
And most of those are part of individual committees that are not directly tied into representing students, but planning programs that are part of that.

00:43.895 --> 00:51.985
So, you know, I've been to just as many, I was a part of just as many activities being corps commanders as I was student body president.

00:52.125 --> 00:54.789
Some things are differently, some things are different obviously.

00:55.169 --> 00:55.389
All right.

00:55.450 --> 00:59.755
So, in fact, then your track is to move

00:59.735 --> 01:03.539
to be Corps Commander and then be Student Body President?

01:03.839 --> 01:04.820
That was what worked for me.

01:04.940 --> 01:07.262
Do I think that that's what needs to be done?

01:07.462 --> 01:08.423
No, not necessarily.

01:08.703 --> 01:09.804
All right.

01:09.824 --> 01:16.691
When did you, was your first Corps leadership step up with the Muster Committee?

01:17.892 --> 01:19.954
No, I don't think they had anything to do with each other.

01:20.975 --> 01:23.818
When did you first begin to step up?

01:25.239 --> 01:28.242
I mean, I went to Corps staff on my junior year.

01:29.523 --> 01:29.623
Okay.

01:30.076 --> 01:36.690
But being involved in things outside of the Corps was not necessarily related to what I did inside the Corps.

01:36.710 --> 01:43.864
Describe as far as you know what the process was that led to your selection as a member of Corps staff.

01:45.628 --> 01:49.375
Well, I've always been, well, I don't know.

01:49.416 --> 01:51.139
That's a tough question.

01:51.878 --> 01:53.724
I mean, I pride myself on my work ethic.

01:53.744 --> 02:03.795
That doesn't mean that I don't mess up a lot, but I pride myself on my work ethic, and I try to do different projects outside of just the unit level.

02:04.147 --> 02:22.375
and I've spent a lot of time working with other outfits and other companies and and so I think that I wasn't it wasn't like I was just another face in the crowd I've always known a little quite a few people in the Corps so and I don't think that that was a shock I'd spent a lot of time trying to

02:23.688 --> 02:33.821
publicize core activities and coordinate some core activities in terms of not just internally making them better, but visibly outside.

02:34.482 --> 02:40.329
And I think so they, that seemed appealing to have to them on core staff, so that's what I did.

02:40.770 --> 02:44.835
Did you begin to dream of this possibility as a sophomore?

02:44.815 --> 02:46.319
No, no, I sure didn't.

02:47.422 --> 02:49.066
That was not really a focus at all.

02:49.187 --> 02:56.486
I was trying to be a, thought a yellow leader might be a fun thing to do, only to find out that's not what my buddies wanted me to do.

02:56.626 --> 03:00.276
And so I didn't really know what to do after the end of my sophomore year.

03:00.627 --> 03:12.706
That same friend I told you about when I showed up on that first day and got me to come into K-1 was the one who said, why don't you, you know, go to core staff because he was on core staff his junior year.

03:13.247 --> 03:15.210
Did you apply for core staff?

03:15.230 --> 03:16.633
Yes, applied for core staff.

03:16.953 --> 03:18.435
Was there an interview process?

03:18.475 --> 03:19.898
Yes, there was an interview process.

03:20.158 --> 03:25.707
What kind of points do you think were most important in the interview process?

03:25.957 --> 03:27.261
Oh, that's tough.

03:27.581 --> 03:33.036
I've seen it from both sides, interviewing and then being the one interviewed.

03:33.618 --> 03:35.604
And it's different.

03:35.664 --> 03:41.620
Everybody's got different characteristics they're looking for when you're applying for a commander position.

03:42.038 --> 03:48.586
That's a lot more selective and it's, they're a different group of people making that selection.

03:48.606 --> 04:00.662
But staffs, people have always, the Commandant's office and the ROTC's office and different places like that have always given those commanders the flexibility to pick the staff that they want to work with.

04:01.283 --> 04:05.007
So, you know, it is very subjective and you have the opportunity to do that.

04:05.067 --> 04:09.413
So what was the Corps Commander my, you know, junior year looking for?

04:09.393 --> 04:12.858
I don't know, but apparently he liked what I had to offer, so.

04:12.878 --> 04:16.003
What kinds of questions do you remember that they ask in interviews?

04:19.228 --> 04:29.364
They asked about different programs and things or what I felt was important about making people outside the Corps recognize about the Corps.

04:30.085 --> 04:32.228
I remember them asking

04:33.541 --> 04:39.584
What would be some policies I would enact if I was a Corps commander, which I had no idea, but that's okay.

04:39.604 --> 04:41.290
But they asked me some of those questions.

04:41.708 --> 04:47.895
Ask me about what I thought the biggest problems were in the Corps and how would I manage that, what were some problems and things that I would tackle.

04:47.976 --> 04:49.838
So those were some of the questions.

04:49.998 --> 04:55.124
And do you think that they expected a completely honest answer to your questions?

04:55.385 --> 04:56.226
I think they did.

04:56.286 --> 04:56.846
I don't know.

04:56.906 --> 05:05.116
I think when I first interviewed, I probably would tell you that they wanted the answer that I thought was the right one politically, so to speak.

05:05.617 --> 05:10.703
But when I had the opportunity to do the interviewing myself, I think that it's much more the honest answer.

05:10.683 --> 05:15.430
that they're looking for than a political answer.

05:17.093 --> 05:19.837
And the fact that you were in K-1?

05:19.917 --> 05:20.899
That's correct.

05:20.919 --> 05:22.421
Was that a plus or a minus?

05:22.742 --> 05:24.104
I think it was probably a plus.

05:25.526 --> 05:29.171
But they weren't, they didn't have an inside deal or anything like that?

05:29.492 --> 05:30.654
No, no, no.

05:30.954 --> 05:34.159
I think it was a plus in the sense that, you know, you got 20,

05:34.443 --> 05:36.566
I'm trying to remember, I think it's 29 outfits in the Corps.

05:37.428 --> 05:42.977
You know, just like any organization, there are good outfits and there are bad outfits.

05:43.377 --> 05:48.546
And so clearly being a part of some have some higher merit than others.

05:49.247 --> 05:57.480
And I think K-1 is a respected one, and at least I think if you were to ask, most people would be somewhere up on that list.

05:57.595 --> 06:00.921
And so that certainly helps, but you still have to prove yourself.

06:00.941 --> 06:02.584
Now, which branch?

06:02.604 --> 06:02.964
It's Army.

06:03.245 --> 06:03.485
Army.

06:03.966 --> 06:13.703
And was there, if we look back in recent years, could we see a difference in the branches of the key leaders in the Corps?

06:13.743 --> 06:15.305
Has there been one that's predominated?

06:16.447 --> 06:17.369
That's a good question.

06:17.589 --> 06:18.371
Typically Army.

06:19.172 --> 06:20.274
Typically Army has.

06:21.296 --> 06:23.299
But that's changed since I've been in.

06:23.566 --> 06:32.959
If I were to look back, if I was to tell you all the ones from my sophomore year back, they're predominantly Army.

06:33.499 --> 06:37.565
If you go from my junior year forward, it's predominantly Air Force.

06:38.506 --> 06:39.367
And it's mixed bag.

06:39.387 --> 06:40.028
I shouldn't say that.

06:40.168 --> 06:41.170
It's kind of a mixed bag.

06:43.272 --> 06:45.475
There's been two Air Force and one Marine Corps.

06:46.216 --> 06:47.418
So it's been different.

06:47.438 --> 06:49.000
It's been across the board.

06:48.980 --> 06:56.003
So it's starting to get a lot more broad in terms of selection than what it used to be.

06:57.350 --> 07:21.282
the so you're on the core staff as a junior what were your duties uh i did the public relations on the core core staff so planning different core events i think we worked on a it never happened since but but we worked on having i know a mixture with the core freshmen and sorority girls we did

07:21.717 --> 07:29.694
I know we hosted a 5K run and did some other, we did work with the media in terms of publicizing activities and stuff we did.

07:29.854 --> 07:32.119
Coordinated the March of Brazos and stuff like that.

07:32.259 --> 07:33.882
Where were these mixers held these?

07:35.285 --> 07:39.574
When we had it, it was held at, oh I don't know, I think it was out at

07:40.381 --> 07:44.230
You know, I don't know what the name of it, but it's out by the Brazos Center.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.255
I'm not sure if it was there or just north of there.

07:46.555 --> 07:48.039
Was this a dance?

07:48.620 --> 07:49.302
Yeah, it was a dance.

07:49.322 --> 07:50.284
It was a dance.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.767
A band and so forth?

07:51.787 --> 07:51.928
Mm-hmm.

07:51.948 --> 07:56.398
What did a young corps member wear to that kind of an event?

07:57.020 --> 08:06.328
I think they told you as freshmen pretty often to wear, you know, slacks or khakis or something like that and then wear a, you know, a nice shirt.

08:06.348 --> 08:07.589
That was pretty standard.

08:07.609 --> 08:07.769
Okay.

08:07.789 --> 08:09.431
So not, didn't have to wear a uniform?

08:09.511 --> 08:10.472
No, didn't have to wear a uniform.

08:10.492 --> 08:12.113
I mean, if it was on campus, you certainly did.

08:12.173 --> 08:14.936
But off campus, you didn't necessarily have to.

08:16.637 --> 08:25.525
Was it normal in the, by your days, normal in the evenings when you left campus not to wear a uniform?

08:26.483 --> 08:29.874
I think when you left campus, I think it was probably pretty common.

08:30.998 --> 08:39.767
But when you were, I guess, I don't know, it was kind of very, if you were doing any kind of activity, very often you were in corps uniform.

08:40.372 --> 08:48.322
But if you were lounging around the dorms, if you were going to a friend's house, if you were going to catch a bite to eat somewhere off the campus.

08:48.502 --> 08:49.343
Or going to the movies.

08:49.363 --> 08:50.925
Or going to the movies or something like that.

08:50.985 --> 08:52.547
Now, of course, you were in regular clothes.

08:53.969 --> 08:54.289
Let's see.

08:54.329 --> 08:55.330
Student indulgences.

08:56.011 --> 09:01.598
How much alcohol would we have found in the dormitories, the core dorms?

09:03.961 --> 09:07.105
You know, that varies from year to year, too.

09:08.283 --> 09:11.168
This is kind of one of those odd times that I think it's changing.

09:11.208 --> 09:15.575
So what it was like my freshman year, was it common to see a lot of it?

09:15.595 --> 09:16.517
Yeah, I think it was.

09:17.478 --> 09:20.824
At this point, if I was to walk back through the dorms, is it as common?

09:21.445 --> 09:21.645
No.

09:22.347 --> 09:26.654
So in five years, I think there's been a big pendulum.

09:26.674 --> 09:28.837
I'm not going to say that's been necessarily well received.

09:29.599 --> 09:34.527
Some of the reasons you don't find alcohol is not because people woke up one morning and said, we don't want to have alcohol in dorms.

09:34.507 --> 09:37.773
It's because they decided that's not what they want.

09:37.793 --> 09:40.779
The administration doesn't feel that that's appropriate to have that there.

09:41.340 --> 09:51.418
So, you know, it's mixed signals, mixed attitudes about it, but they're certainly a lot less in dorms than what they would have seen five years ago.

09:51.438 --> 09:56.127
Is the average undergraduate consuming less alcohol now, do you think, than five years ago?

09:58.064 --> 10:00.030
I'm not really sure if they're consuming less.

10:01.755 --> 10:03.079
Probably just at different places.

10:03.961 --> 10:04.884
And it's beer?

10:05.445 --> 10:06.509
Yeah, primarily beer.

10:06.829 --> 10:07.050
Beer.

10:07.873 --> 10:09.778
What about whiskey and other?

10:10.062 --> 10:11.183
Alcohol?

10:11.323 --> 10:12.865
It just kind of depends on the person.

10:12.925 --> 10:20.091
It's mostly, mostly beer, but it's not like you, it's weird to see an individual who just has a fetish with drinking whiskey.

10:20.152 --> 10:21.273
I guess that's okay, but.

10:23.515 --> 10:31.202
And smoking, how, tobacco, how, what percentage do you think of folks, undergraduate smoke now?

10:34.205 --> 10:36.627
There are certainly people who smoke.

10:37.906 --> 10:39.388
We're talking about tobacco at this point.

10:39.408 --> 10:39.669
Right.

10:39.869 --> 10:44.156
No, I think there are certainly a lot of people who use tobacco.

10:44.256 --> 10:50.565
I can't say if you asked me whether more people chewed or more people smoked, I'd say more people chewed than smoked.

10:50.585 --> 10:51.687
Would it be one out of four?

10:53.951 --> 10:56.655
I'd probably say that maybe one out of four.

10:57.015 --> 10:58.678
I don't know if that's high or not.

10:58.698 --> 11:02.023
You're starting to see a lot fewer people use it.

11:02.881 --> 11:09.613
But I see fewer people, I see a reduction in smoking than I do a reduction in tobacco use.

11:11.636 --> 11:16.104
Just down here, I think more people just have a tendency to chew or something like that.

11:16.826 --> 11:19.911
What about smoking or chewing in the dorm?

11:21.038 --> 11:23.262
Well, you can't, you have to go outside a smoke dorm.

11:23.282 --> 11:25.526
You can't smoke in the... No fudging on that roof.

11:25.626 --> 11:27.669
No, you don't.

11:27.710 --> 11:29.953
I mean, the smoke alarms will go off, so you can't really do that.

11:29.973 --> 11:30.574
What about chewing?

11:30.915 --> 11:32.638
Now, that there's, that's pretty common in the dorm.

11:32.738 --> 11:34.141
I'm not going to lie, that's very common.

11:34.181 --> 11:36.685
But it's not, it's not approved.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.201
No, you can do that.

11:38.261 --> 11:42.006
I mean, nobody's ever outlawed that in the dorms.

11:43.167 --> 11:49.575
There are some floors that are substance-free, not in the core, but outside of the core.

11:50.617 --> 11:56.924
And my understanding is on those substance-free floors, none of that, nothing is supposed to be in the dorms.

11:57.865 --> 11:59.588
But otherwise, no.

12:01.490 --> 12:03.212
Nobody uses snuff anymore, do they?

12:04.306 --> 12:10.093
Granny stuff, or you're talking about just like the, there's some stuff that I've seen out there you put in the hands and sniff it.

12:10.494 --> 12:13.117
I very, very rarely ever see anybody with that.

12:13.157 --> 12:14.459
That's pretty rare.

12:14.499 --> 12:15.921
What about teflin?

12:15.941 --> 12:17.263
Oh yeah, that's common.

12:17.343 --> 12:17.763
Is that it?

12:17.783 --> 12:18.444
Oh yeah.

12:18.464 --> 12:19.145
And cigars?

12:20.427 --> 12:21.288
I like cigars.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.871
So yeah, there are people that like cigars.

12:23.911 --> 12:24.712
I think fewer people.

12:24.812 --> 12:25.874
It's a more expensive habit.

12:26.755 --> 12:29.098
And how, what about drugs?

12:29.821 --> 12:36.773
You know, I know it's around, but it's not very publicized.

12:36.793 --> 12:39.998
I mean, I can't honestly tell you where it's at.

12:42.342 --> 12:46.489
I'm pretty aware that if you were to go ask, you could probably find it.

12:48.593 --> 12:51.758
But it's really kind of kept on a down low.

12:52.820 --> 12:54.563
So I'm not really sure where it's at.

12:54.948 --> 12:59.616
I think the cops apparently tend to really feel it's a problem at College Station.

13:00.357 --> 13:01.579
And I don't know.

13:01.739 --> 13:09.732
If you'd asked me just from looking around and seeing, I think compared to a lot of other cities, I think it's a lot less of a problem.

13:10.293 --> 13:14.880
Even coming from my high school, I saw more of my high school than I see it here in college.

13:14.860 --> 13:21.849
But I don't know if that's just because it's kept a lot more quiet around here or whether it's really used less.

13:22.149 --> 13:22.710
I don't know.

13:22.810 --> 13:29.979
Did you ever see in the dorms, did you ever see anybody that you knew was on to something?

13:30.580 --> 13:37.388
There's only one person that I ever knew was doing drugs while in the corps in the dorms.

13:37.609 --> 13:42.555
And I never, ever saw him in the dorms do it, but I knew he was.

13:43.463 --> 13:51.412
Is there a specific advisor or advisory office for someone who has a drug problem?

13:52.594 --> 13:55.357
Student life usually handles a lot of those issues.

13:56.058 --> 13:59.902
I mean, maybe they refer you to counseling or counseling services or something like that.

14:00.623 --> 14:04.948
But I think it's typically handled under the Department of Student Life.

14:06.310 --> 14:09.133
See, like these questions that I've got here.

14:09.113 --> 14:13.963
When I would ask somebody who was here 50 years ago, didn't even know the word heroin.

14:14.865 --> 14:17.049
Had heard the word marijuana but had never seen it.

14:17.650 --> 14:23.181
And supposedly if you smoked one marijuana cigarette, it would drive you crazy.

14:23.201 --> 14:26.127
So times have changed a whole bunch.

14:26.107 --> 14:34.666
Back to your leadership, you're on the Corps staff as a junior.

14:34.746 --> 14:35.147
That's correct.

14:35.888 --> 14:39.216
When do you begin even to dream about Corps commander?

14:40.338 --> 14:45.870
Not until after Christmas time, spring semester, junior year.

14:45.850 --> 14:53.382
You know, this was so hard for me to really understand is there are a lot of people who come in here and have specific intentions of doing one thing or the other.

14:54.083 --> 14:57.749
One, I didn't know anything about the school when I showed up, so that's not a possibility.

14:58.370 --> 15:05.581
And two, I didn't really understand what anybody did, so I couldn't say that I aspired to be something.

15:07.845 --> 15:11.250
I certainly thought about being Corps Commander a lot later.

15:11.230 --> 15:17.599
a lot later than most of the other applicants, at least the applicants that were seriously being considered anyway.

15:18.820 --> 15:20.322
I certainly thought about it a lot later.

15:21.023 --> 15:33.400
But once again, I thought about trying to be a senior Yale leader again, so I, you know, that was really what I first thought at first, and then changed my mind somewhere in the middle of the spring.

15:33.420 --> 15:34.661
All right.

15:34.681 --> 15:39.668
And there was no, was there a, I'll say an older adult

15:39.850 --> 15:42.674
who gave you advice on these matters?

15:43.275 --> 15:45.739
No, nobody gave me advice on this matter.

15:46.600 --> 15:52.749
I think somewhere, I don't know whether I just thought about it a lot and sat down and figured out what it was I really wanted to do.

15:52.769 --> 16:02.042
I'm not really sure exactly what it was that made me determine that, but somewhere in the process I thought, you know, I guess maybe my friends were Yale leaders.

16:02.102 --> 16:03.985
A lot of my friends were Yale leaders.

16:04.083 --> 16:06.949
And so I had the opportunity to do a lot of things.

16:06.989 --> 16:08.351
I did a lot of traveling with them.

16:08.392 --> 16:14.704
I went a lot of places with them and got to see a lot of things I did, only to find out that I didn't think it was really the greatest job out there.

16:16.267 --> 16:20.235
They were certainly very, very busy in doing jobs that

16:20.502 --> 16:26.393
It was fun, but once again, I think that's when I started to think, well, I like the fun, but I'd rather make an impact.

16:28.737 --> 16:31.603
So I didn't really think that I could do that being a Yale leader.

16:32.324 --> 16:35.309
So I think that's when I said, well, that's not really what I want to do.

16:35.470 --> 16:38.656
Let me see if I take my chances running for court.

16:38.856 --> 16:41.120
So you submit a written application.

16:41.180 --> 16:42.122
Describe it.

16:42.828 --> 16:45.572
The application is really, there's not much to the application.

16:45.592 --> 16:47.114
I think there were a few questions to answer.

16:48.616 --> 16:51.180
Most of it was down to the interview process.

16:51.280 --> 16:54.284
About how many applied, how many were interviewed and so forth.

16:54.364 --> 16:54.985
Describe that.

16:55.746 --> 17:06.000
There, you submit your application, there's, I think we had about 30, 31, 32 applicants, something like that, that applied to be corps commander.

17:06.402 --> 17:09.047
And I think that was pretty typical last year.

17:09.087 --> 17:13.294
There was a decrease in the number of applicants.

17:13.895 --> 17:14.917
I don't really know why.

17:14.937 --> 17:17.121
I mean, I've been out of the Corps, so I don't really know.

17:17.702 --> 17:24.293
But I think while I've been here, about 25, 30 applicants has been pretty standard.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.308
From there, there's a first cut.

17:27.368 --> 17:36.682
Obviously, they do make sure you're not on any kind of probation, make sure your grades are okay, and don't have any conduct violations and that kind of stuff.

17:37.623 --> 17:40.787
And once they've done that, then some people get eliminated from that.

17:41.989 --> 17:52.845
And once they take that list, I know that the interview board then meets to determine exactly how many people they want to interview.

17:53.433 --> 17:58.943
And that criteria for what it is that determines the number of people they want to interview has changed.

17:59.564 --> 18:00.726
It changes from year to year.

18:01.347 --> 18:05.455
But they determined with my group, I think they interviewed 10.

18:05.535 --> 18:12.568
I think out of that 31 or 32, I think they probably seriously considered 20 or so.

18:12.608 --> 18:15.373
And then they decided to interview 10.

18:15.725 --> 18:23.948
And then you went to the, that board, the corps commander selection board that night, and then they selected the corps commander and deputy corps commander.

18:24.249 --> 18:24.570
All right.

18:24.590 --> 18:29.785
How many, so there, how long was the interview?

18:30.541 --> 18:33.386
Well, it lasted about a half hour.

18:33.767 --> 18:36.832
It could have, you know, some people lasted longer, some people shorter.

18:37.433 --> 18:39.276
So I think a half hour is probably approved.

18:39.296 --> 18:40.598
What were some of the key questions?

18:40.659 --> 18:42.181
Are you allowed to share those?

18:42.762 --> 18:44.786
As far as I understand, it's not secret.

18:44.826 --> 18:54.743
I mean, the only thing we were ever told not to discuss is the following year when we were interviewing is what it was that we discussed about individuals.

18:54.723 --> 19:06.354
They asked everything from integration policies to alcohol policies to, you know, working just then leadership development questions, you know, team building, how you're working with individuals.

19:07.135 --> 19:17.524
But a lot of it was vision-oriented, goal-oriented, things that you wanted to accomplish, what programs, or I shouldn't say programs, but what kind of policies do you think were going to make the Corps better?

19:18.205 --> 19:21.388
What was going to make it a better organization, and how did you intend to do it?

19:22.162 --> 19:24.885
And when you finished your interview, how well did you think you'd done?

19:26.087 --> 19:29.431
I thought I'd done okay, but I didn't think that I would get it.

19:30.873 --> 19:35.758
So, in fact, the next morning, now, there was no deputy corps commander application.

19:35.778 --> 19:36.780
There was no such thing.

19:36.800 --> 19:45.410
You applied for corps commander, and they, you could certainly go in the interview and tell them that you were more interested in doing deputy corps commander, and they would certainly consider that.

19:46.471 --> 19:51.898
But I had actually encouraged one of my best friends at the time who was on corps staff with me.

19:52.486 --> 19:55.097
to apply for deputy corps commander.

19:56.201 --> 19:59.635
And it took him a while to convince him to do that, but he had done that.

20:00.498 --> 20:03.390
And I think his interview went well, at least from what he told me.

20:03.927 --> 20:10.195
We got up the next morning, and sure enough, we actually had a meeting, the both of us, to coordinate the March of Brazos.

20:10.716 --> 20:14.261
And we had a meeting with the Commandant and the Deputy Commandant and a whole bunch of staff members.

20:14.721 --> 20:22.552
So obviously, I was clearly trying to figure out how well it was that I was going to, what kind of attitude they were going to show while I was in that meeting.

20:22.572 --> 20:27.158
And they just gave me the cold shoulder about everything, totally everything.

20:27.218 --> 20:31.183
And they just pampered Mark, my friend who was on Corps staff with me.

20:31.163 --> 20:42.515
just pampered him and so I was absolutely convinced that he had gotten it or at least gotten something one of the two but it turns out they picked both of us so you know that they were I guess just messing with us that afternoon.

20:42.555 --> 20:49.262
As far as you know how long was it between the interview and the decision?

20:50.043 --> 20:53.687
I think they finished sometime early in the morning 1 2 a.m something like that.

20:53.707 --> 20:55.028
Was everybody interviewed in

20:55.008 --> 20:57.071
Everybody was interviewed all together.

20:57.632 --> 20:58.092
In one evening?

20:58.112 --> 20:58.753
In one evening.

20:59.054 --> 21:02.178
And then they decided they didn't leave until they made the decision.

21:02.579 --> 21:05.483
And I think it was sometime early morning they made the decision.

21:05.523 --> 21:08.027
And then they didn't announce until 4 o'clock the next afternoon.

21:08.047 --> 21:08.648
And how did you learn?

21:09.068 --> 21:10.831
How was, how were you informed of the decision?

21:10.851 --> 21:13.695
They had a big announcement at 4 o'clock that following day.

21:14.876 --> 21:17.440
So it was in the core center which has been built about.

21:17.941 --> 21:19.463
Was it put on the wall or?

21:19.443 --> 21:21.266
No, there was no, no, it was an announcement.

21:21.447 --> 21:27.438
They brought all the different people who interviewed, different, anybody that wanted to attend could attend.

21:28.079 --> 21:29.742
And they had a public announcement.

21:30.985 --> 21:36.034
And how long did it take you to get to a phone, to make a phone call to somebody?

21:36.183 --> 21:38.266
Uh, it probably took me almost two hours.

21:38.506 --> 21:41.831
Oh, so you didn't, you didn't get to go, you didn't get to go call mom and dad?

21:42.011 --> 21:44.114
No, there was just too many things to do after that.

21:44.214 --> 21:54.227
There were, uh, you know, if it's not just, you know, people trying to congratulate you, there's somebody who wants to talk to you about something, and before you know it, it takes a while before you can get on the phone.

21:54.247 --> 21:58.133
And, uh, did you prep for it in any way?

21:58.633 --> 22:00.756
Prep for the interview, the corps commander interview.

22:00.736 --> 22:01.797
Yeah, certainly.

22:01.837 --> 22:03.179
I mean, there were all kinds of things.

22:03.239 --> 22:06.484
Looked at the Corps Development Council.

22:06.504 --> 22:09.648
They had put together a book and some of their plans and things that they had looked at.

22:10.249 --> 22:11.290
Evaluated some of that.

22:11.310 --> 22:16.597
There was a council that was put together about 10 years ago in the early 90s, a Blue Ribbon Council.

22:16.677 --> 22:18.399
I'm not really sure exactly what it was called anymore.

22:20.162 --> 22:22.264
Looked at some of those policies that they had looked at.

22:22.305 --> 22:24.547
Looked at the ones that had been implemented and the ones that hadn't.

22:25.108 --> 22:29.494
Maybe where we should be going and talked to old Corps commanders.

22:29.744 --> 22:36.935
But you didn't have someone do a sample interview where they'd ask you questions and you would?

22:36.955 --> 22:39.099
No, I never had anyone do a sample interview with me.

22:39.179 --> 22:43.245
I just asked a lot of questions and tried to get as prepared as I could.

22:43.266 --> 22:43.546
All right.

22:44.628 --> 22:49.255
Once you're selected, then what was the routine then?

22:50.315 --> 22:52.138
It got very busy very fast.

22:52.178 --> 23:00.411
The rest of the spring was spent trying to select different commanders, major unit commanders, alpha commanders, staffs.

23:00.671 --> 23:02.674
You know, it got very, very busy very quick.

23:03.235 --> 23:11.387
And so the rest of the spring was spent doing that, writing up your goals, writing up your, just your kind of visions and things like that.

23:11.548 --> 23:14.432
And who was the key people you were working with on that?

23:15.475 --> 23:22.989
My staff, obviously Mark, my friend Mark who was deputy corps commander that year, he and I spent a lot of time.

23:23.229 --> 23:24.051
Mark Masacek.

23:24.471 --> 23:24.932
Spell that.

23:25.213 --> 23:26.896
M-A-C-I-C-E-K.

23:27.477 --> 23:29.561
A good Czech name sounds like.

23:29.621 --> 23:30.522
It is Czech.

23:32.145 --> 23:34.750
So he and I spent a lot of time putting a lot of that together.

23:34.730 --> 23:38.400
And of course as you start selecting new people, you start building that with new people.

23:38.680 --> 23:41.809
But it took a while for us to get all that together.

23:42.531 --> 23:48.807
Did anybody in any manner give you any no-no's, you don't do this or this or this?

23:48.938 --> 23:51.401
Oh, there were all kinds of people who said different things.

23:51.461 --> 24:04.439
I mean, I had a guy that the professor of military science didn't like one of the answers to my questions that evening and called me up the next day and wanted to have a sit-down discussion about why he was concerned about the answer to my question.

24:05.060 --> 24:07.403
So there were lots of people.

24:07.383 --> 24:13.735
Everybody had different things you could and couldn't do, and the only thing I came to really realize is that nobody really knew what you could and couldn't do.

24:13.755 --> 24:17.182
It was very subjective.

24:17.363 --> 24:19.908
What were your personal guidelines?

24:20.248 --> 24:21.471
Well, I developed that.

24:21.992 --> 24:23.755
Actually, I mean, if I was to go back and

24:24.477 --> 24:26.601
regurgitated to you, I don't know if I could do that.

24:27.081 --> 24:30.587
But I wrote all these things down and handed it out to all the commanders.

24:30.607 --> 24:33.172
And, you know, a lot of they were basic policies.

24:33.252 --> 24:36.537
I mean, I think consistency is important.

24:36.678 --> 24:43.750
I think that even if you're wrong, at least if you're consistent, it makes it easier to evaluate your decisions and setting the example.

24:43.830 --> 24:46.013
And there were a lot of different policies that you came up.

24:46.053 --> 24:47.616
Much more of them were not

24:47.596 --> 24:53.014
tangible things as more as philosophical attitudes and things that you did.

24:53.054 --> 24:59.074
Alright, and you officially became Corps Commander at what date?

24:59.881 --> 25:00.962
You know, I don't know the date.

25:01.503 --> 25:02.965
It's always final review.

25:02.985 --> 25:04.447
I mean, even though you're... Oh, it is.

25:04.888 --> 25:05.188
Right.

25:05.449 --> 25:13.159
You're selected somewhere in March or April, but you're not officially Corps Commander until you're final review.

25:13.179 --> 25:18.767
Did the previous Corps Commander in those weeks when you all worked together, did he give you some advice?

25:19.523 --> 25:21.525
He gave lots of different advice.

25:21.545 --> 25:25.950
A lot of it was, you know, you have to just kind of bury yourself in it and figure it out.

25:27.112 --> 25:29.955
Some things are easy to teach you and some things are not.

25:30.435 --> 25:33.819
Some experiences you have to just get out there and learn.

25:33.939 --> 25:38.885
So I think his philosophy was, let me show you what I've done, read it, figure it out.

25:38.985 --> 25:40.387
If you have questions, come back.

25:41.248 --> 25:43.270
And I think that that was important because

25:43.857 --> 25:48.685
You know, even at the time, if he had spent 10 hours telling me everything, I don't know how much of it I really would have understood.

25:48.725 --> 25:53.312
So he tried to kind of just coach me through it, advice that I do.

25:53.332 --> 25:54.674
I don't know.

25:55.255 --> 25:57.359
Probably don't believe everything that everybody tells you.

25:57.819 --> 25:59.322
It's not all true, so.

25:59.342 --> 25:59.542
All right.

25:59.562 --> 26:03.568
General Hopgood, what was his role in all of this process?

26:07.775 --> 26:10.219
His personality's different.

26:10.672 --> 26:18.063
He was a lot more laid back unless he decided that he wanted to specifically play a role in something.

26:18.844 --> 26:21.147
And I think I found that out later on in the year.

26:21.768 --> 26:23.270
I remember going to ask him for something.

26:23.310 --> 26:29.659
I don't remember what it was I went to go ask him for, but I said, you know, this is one of the things that we'd like to do.

26:30.145 --> 26:36.473
And I'm concerned that, you know, I think that I've heard a lot of talk out there about not doing this program we'd like to work with.

26:37.674 --> 26:41.759
And he said, well, he says, Forrest, he says, I wasn't the Corps commander when I was here.

26:42.160 --> 26:43.742
I didn't want to be, and I don't want to be now.

26:43.922 --> 26:45.464
So you make that decision and move on.

26:45.544 --> 26:50.951
So, you know, very, very rarely did he interfere with what I wanted to do.

26:50.991 --> 26:56.878
I think his biggest concern was was it well thought out and was it within the parameters?

26:57.280 --> 27:01.929
wherever how wide those parameters were, were they inside the parameters of what he felt was okay.

27:02.250 --> 27:04.555
Was he part of the interview board?

27:04.895 --> 27:07.320
Yes, there were 20 people, 22 people on the interview board.

27:07.741 --> 27:10.046
How many students and how many?

27:10.066 --> 27:12.310
It was about 50-50 split.

27:12.330 --> 27:14.715
Were there any females on the interview board?

27:16.197 --> 27:19.162
I think there was one or two.

27:19.582 --> 27:20.384
I'm not really sure.

27:21.866 --> 27:28.096
And throughout all this process, correct me if I'm wrong, you were not planning to be a career military officer?

27:28.737 --> 27:29.278
No, I was.

27:29.358 --> 27:30.359
I was planning to be.

27:31.261 --> 27:37.911
Yes, I had a scholarship once I got here to go into the military and to be a commissioner's lieutenant in the Army.

27:38.031 --> 27:40.836
So at that point, I was still supposed to be.

27:40.856 --> 27:41.597
Oh, okay.

27:41.577 --> 27:51.679
And so your first official command assignment is at final review your junior year.

27:52.320 --> 27:53.964
By then you had some senior boots.

27:53.984 --> 27:55.107
Where did you buy them?

27:55.127 --> 27:55.608
The Hawlicks.

27:55.948 --> 27:58.995
I mean I think there are other places you can buy them although they're

27:59.498 --> 28:06.748
Some people hand make them in Houston and there's some other people know some family friends that can do it, but the majority of people still buy them in hogs.

28:06.768 --> 28:09.672
How much did that cost?

28:09.692 --> 28:11.995
I think ours were between six and seven hundred dollars.

28:12.936 --> 28:15.440
And was that your money or mom and dad or?

28:15.680 --> 28:16.721
No, most of it was my money.

28:17.542 --> 28:19.465
Now what had you done in the summers?

28:20.120 --> 28:22.806
Done internships almost all summer, each summer.

28:22.966 --> 28:24.269
Okay.

28:25.030 --> 28:31.003
And how did you feel when you put those boots on and went the first time in a senior regalia?

28:31.925 --> 28:32.907
Well, I think it's really neat.

28:33.067 --> 28:40.002
It's very special to see that you've come from, you know, three years comes and goes very, very quickly.

28:40.741 --> 28:45.488
And it's neat to see how far you've come, you know, in a short period of time.

28:45.528 --> 28:46.369
And it is.

28:46.429 --> 28:47.250
It's special.

28:47.310 --> 28:52.498
And it's scary at the same time when, you know, you finally realize there's nobody else out there to help you anymore.

28:53.699 --> 28:56.864
So it's scary, but it's neat and it's exciting.

28:57.765 --> 29:02.552
What special people were there for that first final review for you?

29:02.672 --> 29:04.194
My mom and my grandparents were there.

29:04.775 --> 29:04.875
Okay.

29:04.855 --> 29:15.109
And then, let's see, then commencement and then off for the summer.

29:16.091 --> 29:20.517
Now what are the duties of a Corps commander during the summer before their senior year?

29:21.118 --> 29:22.159
What do you have to worry about?

29:22.219 --> 29:26.425
The first thing I went to, it, it,

29:26.405 --> 29:30.817
During that summer, I had to go do my advanced training for the Army.

29:31.138 --> 29:31.359
Where?

29:31.800 --> 29:32.843
At Fort Lewis, Washington.

29:33.545 --> 29:35.250
So half the summer was spent there.

29:35.290 --> 29:39.722
The other half was here just working on different projects, trying to get things ready for the fall.

29:39.989 --> 29:49.019
You know, if it was getting some of the commander meetings and stuff like that ready or sometimes there would be some different small projects to work with with the Commandant on.

29:49.039 --> 30:00.712
Now, did anybody either successfully or unsuccessfully try to let you in on some inside problem that nobody knew about that needed solving?

30:03.936 --> 30:04.737
I don't know.

30:05.918 --> 30:09.422
I think I began to see a lot of politics at that point.

30:09.571 --> 30:17.302
And sometimes people would, people I don't think were ever very quiet about their problems.

30:17.663 --> 30:22.550
At that point, I think I began to find that people were very public about their discerns.

30:24.172 --> 30:28.057
The only time that people would get quiet was if it was about a particular individual.

30:29.740 --> 30:33.625
But most people began to tell you exactly what they thought was wrong with the Corps.

30:33.786 --> 30:35.528
People were very, very open about it.

30:35.508 --> 30:40.253
And even adults, very, very open about what they thought was wrong.

30:40.653 --> 30:43.737
What were the majority opinions?

30:44.758 --> 30:46.580
Oh, there was no majority opinion.

30:46.620 --> 30:47.941
They were wide and varied.

30:48.481 --> 30:51.024
So, you know, it depended on what class year you were talking to.

30:51.044 --> 30:52.826
What were the samples of some of the?

30:52.926 --> 31:01.515
Everything from, you know, we need to have more women in the Corps to, you know, needs to,

31:01.495 --> 31:04.000
There's not enough people taking care of their uniforms.

31:04.040 --> 31:07.467
I'm tired of walking around and seeing people not shine their boots when they're going to class.

31:08.049 --> 31:13.480
Everything from the smallest of nitpicky things to problems that really were out of my control.
