WEBVTT

00:02.393 --> 00:10.681
As you were aware, for your contemporary 
students, what were the sinful activities? They

00:10.881 --> 00:12.263
drank a little. Did they smoke? And if so, what did 
they smoke? Well, they drank a little. Hard liquor

00:19.209 --> 00:20.631
and mainly beer. A lot of beer busts. You know, I 
said earlier we didn't drink very much, but we did.

00:27.037 --> 00:32.282
We could get keg beer and beer and take it out and 
have our barbecues and that kind of thing. And a

00:33.325 --> 00:36.489
number of kids smoked. I didn't. But a number of 
them did, and they smoked cigarettes, tobacco.

00:43.660 --> 00:44.441
Very few pipes. Some, you never know, they were 
cigar. But we didn't know, I didn't know anything

00:47.445 --> 00:51.491
about dope or drugs. Did you even know the 
vocabulary? Didn't know anything about that

00:53.594 --> 00:56.618
until many years later. What about chewing 
tobacco? There were a few that chewed tobacco, but

00:59.161 --> 01:03.147
they weren't very clever. Let's see. Core trip? 
Describe a core trip. Well, a core trip was twice a

01:11.028 --> 01:14.052
year. The entire core would go off to a football 
game. It was to, back in those days, to Austin,

01:18.257 --> 01:30.133
Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth. So it would be 
like... in Fort Worth and Houston one year, and

01:33.890 --> 01:38.075
Dallas and Austin the other year. They have those 
reversed, but anyway. And the whole core was,

01:40.698 --> 01:56.156
well, of course, we had Saturday classes, so it was 
a little bit difficult to get to a football game in

01:40.698 --> 01:56.156
Dallas for 2 o'clock kickoff on Saturday at noon 
with Saturday morning classes. So most of that

01:56.357 --> 02:03.525
time, the classes on Saturday morning were either 
scratched or canceled or whatever. And I remember

02:04.383 --> 02:11.773
one of the petroleum professors saying, it 
doesn't matter what you do because of a poor trip.

02:11.793 --> 02:14.837
Somebody would leave early if you had a poor trip to 
have. So kids would leave. They'd leave early and

02:18.042 --> 02:21.467
get to wherever they wanted. As we mentioned 
earlier, a lot of them have to travel by

02:21.487 --> 02:24.551
hitchhiking. So we were trying to get to Dallas for 
a Saturday afternoon game and a parade Saturday

02:24.571 --> 02:32.702
morning before that. You really need to get up 
there the night before. Do you remember the Corps

02:36.649 --> 02:40.052
trip your senior year when you were Corps 
Commander? I remember very well. Where? In Dallas

02:42.335 --> 02:44.017
and in Austin. And where in Dallas did y'all march? 
We marched, I remember the streets in Dallas.

02:51.745 --> 02:53.146
Elmer, Maine. Well, we marched up Maine. We 
marched, we formed on the west end down there

02:54.248 --> 03:00.995
somewhere, marched east, uphill, going uphill. 
Okay, okay. And I remember getting kidded very

03:02.382 --> 03:10.089
much about it because it was cold, sort of a wet-ish 
day, and we wore white gloves and carried sabers.

03:10.109 --> 03:18.497
And when I came up for eyes right with my saber, came 
up with my hand, and the saber kept going. But I

03:18.517 --> 03:22.840
caught it on the way down. And, of course, my whole 
staff, my staff kidded me about that for a long

03:22.860 --> 03:25.963
time. Anyway, that was Dallas. And then I remember 
also in Austin, we marched from south to north on

03:32.572 --> 03:36.278
Congress Avenue. And as Corps Commander, I had 
several of us went up, the Commandant and my

03:36.298 --> 03:57.853
operations officer, and it seemed like another 
cadet and another officer, went up ahead of time to

03:36.298 --> 03:57.853
Dallas and to Austin, talked with the university 
officials and mainly the police department for

03:36.298 --> 03:57.853
the parade to make sure that everything was and 
where the march would be, where we would perform,

03:58.508 --> 04:05.780
and where we would call out, and so on. And that's 
quite pulling to march up Main Street in Dallas

04:05.800 --> 04:13.973
with the police escort ahead of you, pull behind 
you, and band up behind you. Were there any

04:13.993 --> 04:15.876
incidents of either one? Well, I'm sure there were 
some, but we had nothing like what you hear about.

04:24.783 --> 04:31.012
And

04:24.783 --> 04:31.012
nobody threw anything? No, I'm sure there was 
some, but I don't remember any particular

04:31.032 --> 04:36.399
problem. Describe a typical, your senior year, a 
typical football weekend. It began when and

04:43.409 --> 04:46.053
extended how long? Well, I guess this would be 
typical, semi-typical anyway, at least toward

04:47.395 --> 04:54.705
the end. in my senior year,

04:54.955 --> 05:06.592
football games were normally, some of them were at 
night, early in the season, but most of them would

04:54.955 --> 05:06.592
be in the afternoon. So the date would come down 
either the night before, in my particular case,

05:08.335 --> 05:18.530
from the palace area, and by train. So I'd be there 
on the train and get her settled in to wherever she

05:18.990 --> 05:24.118
was. and then there'd be various activities on 
Saturday morning. What about Friday night?

05:30.458 --> 05:33.060
Usually they'd come in pretty late. Was there a 
Yale practice? Oh yeah, there would be a midnight

05:35.042 --> 05:37.664
Yale practice. Where was it held? We had midnight 
Yale practices in the Grove.

05:45.451 --> 05:48.154
I think that's right. I remember some Yale 
practices over on the steps of the OIMC.

05:56.532 --> 06:02.162
Now, did your being at Aggie have anything to do 
with your meeting this young lady? Well, it did. I

06:04.706 --> 06:21.696
met her in the spring of my junior year when

06:04.706 --> 06:21.696
one particular friend from McKinney and a couple 
of others of us were walking on a Sunday afternoon

06:04.706 --> 06:21.696
over to the MSC and we were over near the main desk 
now, where it was sort of a living room area. And

06:28.200 --> 06:32.185
this boy from McKinney said, say, there's a girl 
from my hometown. Come on over and have an

06:32.245 --> 06:35.750
interview with her. Turned out it's my now wife, 40 
years. And she had been invited down. She was still

06:42.578 --> 06:45.402
in high school. She had been invited down by a 
freshman from McKinney. for the freshman ball and

06:49.992 --> 06:54.879
she had been selected sweetheart of the freshman 
ball. So I was impressed and then the next fall we

06:54.899 --> 07:06.396
ended up having our first date at the Oklahoma 
State game up in Douglas. One thing led to another.

07:08.118 --> 07:11.643
Many years later we got married. My wife and I have 
been married 40 years. We married June 15, 57. Same

07:15.153 --> 07:17.355
date as my wife. You're kidding. Really? Yeah, 
June 15th. Ours was in central North Carolina.

07:26.366 --> 07:34.034
Back to the typical, so when did the day, the 
football day begin for a Corps commander?

07:36.397 --> 07:37.939
Midnight Yelp practice or night before? Midnight 
Yelp practice, and so we would, you know, We'll

07:44.363 --> 07:58.237
pick up our dates at mid-morning or something like 
that and take them for a bite to eat, depending on

07:44.363 --> 07:58.237
where they were staying and who they were staying 
with. We'll have a noon meal, and then Liz and Bill

07:58.257 --> 08:03.202
will talk about how this timing would work. But the 
Corps would march in ahead of the football game, so

08:03.222 --> 08:13.493
we would have to be in uniform, dressing uniform, 
and fall out in formation probably around 1 if the

08:03.222 --> 08:13.493
game was going to be at 2 o'clock. and we'd fall out 
over to the new area and march down Joe Ratt

08:13.962 --> 08:21.870
Boulevard to Columbia. Now did you, was it your 
task to get her placed in the stadium or did she get

08:21.890 --> 08:27.556
there on her own? I ask that question in ignorance 
because I don't know. Well, I'm in ignorance

08:30.539 --> 08:32.461
myself right now. I don't remember how we worked 
that. But she would be with you at the game? She

08:36.525 --> 08:39.228
would be sitting with me at the game, yes. Or 
standing with you? Standing, yeah. Now where did

08:41.570 --> 08:43.412
the Corps commander... Where was the corps 
commander's place in the stadium? Well, once we

08:47.905 --> 09:02.904
passed into view in the stadium and broke 
formation and went up in the stands, it was every

08:47.905 --> 09:02.904
man and his lady for themselves, although there 
was a certain seating arrangement by class. The

09:03.204 --> 09:13.197
seniors got the lower seats, the better seats, and 
ranked sort of behind them, if I remember right,

09:03.204 --> 09:13.197
freshman and senior higher. And then if there was a 
victory, what happened after a victory? Well,

09:20.215 --> 09:28.265
with the victory, it marched over behind the band 
to Fish Pond and had a little yell practice. And the

09:28.285 --> 09:30.608
yell leaders were... The yell leaders were dunked 
into Fish Pond no matter what the weather, cold or

09:30.628 --> 09:36.496
hot or whatever. And then Saturday night was 
normally... Saturday night there was normally

09:36.516 --> 09:43.825
some entertainment around the campus, some kind 
of dance or something like that. And then on Sunday

09:44.885 --> 09:50.452
morning, we'd normally go to church. And 
depending on when the date, had to either get on a

09:50.472 --> 09:58.082
train or a car or a bus or something and get back to 
where she came from. Did you and your friends

09:58.122 --> 10:03.529
attend worship services here in the campus area? 
Yes. Where did you go? I was a Lutheran by

10:07.775 --> 10:13.542
background, and grew up in a Lutheran church, but 
it seemed like I went to Anaheim Methodist Church

10:14.298 --> 10:20.227
in Northgate more than any other place here. Did 
you feel that denominations meant, were terribly

10:20.247 --> 10:28.539
important, or was it to go to church for you and your 
friends? To go to church. I still feel that way. I'm

10:34.508 --> 10:36.972
a Presbyterian now. Let's see. Final Review. 
Describe Final Review in a few days. Well, you

10:43.525 --> 10:49.350
know, final review is an emotional time, and still 
is, I think, observing the cadets. But it's sort of

10:49.470 --> 10:57.537
the culmination of four years of being in the Corps 
together. And in those four years, you've gotten

10:57.557 --> 11:03.763
to be very, very close to a number of people, a 
number of friends. And it's also, at that point,

11:03.783 --> 11:12.250
see the end of the line for being in the Corps, 
turning over your positions to the for the next

11:12.483 --> 11:21.177
class, and so it was pretty emotional. It was in my 
time. I remember very well the time to turn over to

11:21.578 --> 11:27.868
the next Corps commander. That was held on what's 
now called Simpson Drill Field. Was there any

11:32.956 --> 11:36.702
particular guest reviewing officer? There no 
doubt was a reviewing officer. I don't recall now.

11:41.413 --> 11:45.139
I've got pictures at home. Reach back and describe 
Bonfire when you were an undergraduate.

11:56.356 --> 11:59.361
How big, where? Bonfire was held on at that time. I 
remember working on it pretty hard. I don't really

12:10.742 --> 12:13.665
remember my freshman year, but I'm sure we did. I'm 
sure we turned out to be okay. I remember working on

12:15.807 --> 12:24.995
it with some friends in sophomore year, going out 
to the cut area and that kind of thing. My senior

12:25.015 --> 12:33.823
year as Corps Commander, I remember not doing much 
with the physical work, but mainly going around

12:25.015 --> 12:33.823
visiting and making sure things were And it

12:35.272 --> 12:46.238
was made of timber. It wasn't trash, it was timber. 
It was timber. It wasn't anything near what it is

12:51.210 --> 12:53.736
today. It wasn't this uniform deal that they tied 
all this up. I don't really know why they do it that

12:58.300 --> 13:02.585
way now because it tends to policy. They just 
stacked it up there and leaned it against each

13:02.605 --> 13:05.228
other. I'm sure there was some time to keep it up 
there. It didn't look like it does today. Silver

13:13.378 --> 13:14.099
Taps. Silver Taps. Very impressive ceremony. I 
remember I don't remember now particular names

13:20.507 --> 13:24.212
when we went And we were a smaller student body at 
that time, so it didn't occur that it was off and

13:24.479 --> 13:34.029
over. Now they've got

13:34.089 --> 13:40.656
it, I guess, just once a month, no matter how many 
people you kill. A very impressive ceremony. I

13:41.237 --> 13:45.161
can't help but be impressed by it, being out there 
in front of the academic building and all the

13:41.237 --> 13:45.161
lights out. Describe what happened, what it was. 
Well, I believe it's 10 o'clock in the evening at

13:50.207 --> 13:54.351
Silver Taps. Before that, people start moving 
toward the open area on the west side of the

13:55.495 --> 14:04.103
academic building. And at the appointed hour, the 
lights across the campus go out. And you have the

14:08.467 --> 14:17.456
Ross Volunteers fire whatever their salute is, 
how many ever guns they fire. And then there's

14:17.476 --> 14:22.701
silver taps played from the top of the academic 
building. I believe there were five jigglers in

14:23.339 --> 14:30.447
the army, laying the taps, it seemed like, about 
three different times. They were very

14:30.467 --> 14:32.189
impressive, certainly. And then everybody, 
there was no one talking when we were over there, no

14:32.209 --> 14:42.941
one talking during the ceremony, and no one 
talking all the way back until dawn. Other

14:42.961 --> 14:45.945
campuses don't understand that, they don't know. 
Aggie Muster, do you remember Muster in your days?

14:49.749 --> 14:53.093
Well, I remember Muster, particularly my senior 
year, The campus must have had a part in the

14:53.680 --> 14:57.945
program. And a friend of mine, my deputy corps 
commander, was a senior class president, so we

14:58.065 --> 15:05.995
both spoke frequently. The main speaker was a 
governor from Colorado. His name was Thornburg.

15:14.145 --> 15:20.633
He was held on the north side of the MSC. Where that 
overhang is, the MSC has been changed since that

15:21.254 --> 15:26.422
time. There were steps there, and it didn't have 
that dry window that we had there now. So that had

15:31.710 --> 15:38.460
the speakers standing up on top of those steps, and 
people singing back and forth. But the main crowd

15:38.480 --> 15:41.625
was just on the ground up front. It wasn't

15:41.725 --> 15:46.192
that large a crowd, I guess, at the time. What are 
the factors that build Aggie spirit?

15:53.283 --> 15:56.527
What creates Aggie spirit? Well, that's a hard 
thing to describe. I guess no one really

16:00.052 --> 16:05.799
completely understands the tradition. Kids now, 
when they come, they've got these traditions. And

16:09.023 --> 16:20.978
whether they realize it or not, these traditions 
were all, essentially all, the main ones, founded

16:09.023 --> 16:20.978
in the military days of this college and founded by 
the Corps. and have sort of a military background

16:21.262 --> 16:49.446
to them in a lot of ways silver caps we were just 
talking about obviously

16:21.262 --> 16:49.446
all those things uh form part of what's called the 
vegas spirit the

16:21.262 --> 16:49.446
i can understand it back in the days you know when my 
time when Most of the people, most of the students

16:49.814 --> 16:54.341
on the campus were in the Corps because we lived so 
closely together. We knew each other. We really

16:56.544 --> 16:59.829
formed a tremendous bond. Thank goodness a lot of 
that's still carrying on by every looks. I guess

17:06.418 --> 17:10.745
that's the basis of the spirit. As you were 
preparing to leave the campus with your master's

17:10.765 --> 17:19.197
degree, what sort of world did you think you were 
entering? What did you think it was going to be

17:20.864 --> 17:22.406
like?

17:25.890 --> 17:28.312
Well, I didn't really know. I had worked, I was 
going to go into the oil business, and I had worked

17:28.332 --> 17:39.465
during the summers for different oil companies, 
but that was mainly sort of physical work. I wasn't

17:39.665 --> 17:46.733
too sure what I was going to get into in business. 
But, of course, I also was going to, I didn't go into

17:48.657 --> 17:56.324
the military service for a couple of years because 
I had taken my advance contract. I was in the Air

17:56.344 --> 17:57.606
Force. At that time they were looking for people to 
go to flight school. Today it's very hard to get

18:03.391 --> 18:17.044
into flight school, but at that time I could have 
gone and chose not to be a pilot because it would

18:03.391 --> 18:17.044
have meant a four-year commitment rather than two 
years that I've been in the service. had made up my

18:17.935 --> 18:24.022
mind by that time that I wanted to pursue the 
civilian route in the military, although I liked

18:17.935 --> 18:24.022
the military very much. And when I did serve my two 
years, I learned a tremendous

18:24.122 --> 18:32.251
lot. Do you want me to carry on? Yes, please do. I had 
had some friends in the Corps a couple years ahead

18:36.056 --> 18:44.185
of me that had gone into flight school and that kind 
of thing. It just seemed like a long time, too. take

18:47.602 --> 18:53.250
four years if you wanted to pursue a business 
career or an engineering career. So I chose to go on

18:53.270 --> 18:55.873
the two-year route. But as I said, for two years I 
was in the Air Force, so it convinced me that I'd

18:55.893 --> 19:01.301
gone the right way. But even so, I really learned a 
lot dealing with people and so on when I was in the

19:01.321 --> 19:07.729
Air Force. The clothing department works very 
closely with the clothing industry, so they've

19:08.350 --> 19:16.081
given us a pretty good feel for what it was going to 
be like. And I guess I didn't have any real

19:17.470 --> 19:21.154
surprises when I went to work. I worked for Shell 
one summer, but when I finished with my master's

19:21.174 --> 19:32.205
degree, I decided to go work for what has been 
called Umbiloy Repair Company. It's now called

19:32.225 --> 19:37.691
Exxon. And it's strange how you make decisions at 
that period of your life. I'm not really sure how I

19:45.415 --> 19:54.045
made that decision, except I had worked for Shell 
that one summer, and I didn't particularly like

19:45.415 --> 19:54.045
what I had done. And I really thought that Shell was 
too much of an international company. I wanted to

20:00.193 --> 20:05.379
go to work for Humboldt Oil and Refining Company, 
which was, I thought, a domestic operation. It was

20:05.399 --> 20:14.730
after I went to work for them that I realized that 
they were owned about 60% or 70% by Standard Oil in

20:05.399 --> 20:14.730
New Jersey. changing into Exxon. And it was much 
later that I learned that Shell, oil company U.S.,

20:17.935 --> 20:30.626
is a domestic operation, even though it's owned by 
Royal Dutch Shell out of Holloman, England, which

20:17.935 --> 20:30.626
is the international operation. But they let 
Shell Petroleum run its own business, and it is

20:30.906 --> 20:37.753
strictly, pretty well, a domestic company. But I 
never had any regrets about the company I chose.

20:42.637 --> 20:43.738
It's a fine company right there. All right, as you 
recollect, how well did A&M prepare you for the

20:44.157 --> 20:51.406
real world? I thought they prepared me very, very 
well. You know, in my profession, patrolling,

20:54.090 --> 21:02.821
engineering, as I mentioned, they went very 
closely with industry. So I thought, you know,

21:02.841 --> 21:06.987
when I went in, no problem. I never had any problems 
with my engineering background or that kind of

21:07.007 --> 21:11.953
thing. although they forced me to go to some 
training schools for the first year or so after I

21:13.790 --> 21:22.463
got out of the Air

21:13.790 --> 21:22.463
Force. I felt like I already had most of that. So I 
got two ways, I guess. But beyond that, in the

21:28.411 --> 21:37.705
military and dealing with people and that kind of 
thing, I felt like we were very, very well

21:28.411 --> 21:37.705
prepared. Last two questions are almost the same 
question phrased differently. In conclusion,

21:44.746 --> 21:54.584
what did it mean, as you look back on it, what did it 
mean to you, what has it meant to you in your life

21:44.746 --> 21:54.584
that you went to Texas A&M? Well, in the first 
place, it changed my life dramatically. It's hard

22:01.934 --> 22:11.044
to say, well, A&M versus had I gone to TU, or Baylor, 
or Rice, or whatever. I can't do both. But first of

22:13.067 --> 22:20.836
all, it's just the fact that I got a college 
education changed my life from what it would have

22:13.067 --> 22:20.836
been otherwise. And thank God for people like 
Tyler Lee Wynn and so on that were given

22:20.856 --> 22:25.741
scholarships at that time. Although I learned 
later that you could work your way through too, but

22:25.761 --> 22:31.688
I didn't know that at the time. I met my wife here at 
A&M, just all kinds of things. And a number of my

22:40.774 --> 22:46.321
lifelong friends I made here at the school. And I 
guess beyond all that, just the good training, the

22:47.822 --> 23:02.620
good experience, the spirit we were just talking 
about was also sort of a can-do spirit that's built

22:47.822 --> 23:02.620
into you here for whatever reason, however you do 
it. I think all that was a tremendous benefit to me.

23:06.572 --> 23:09.815
So, what feelings do you have in your heart for A&M? 
Well, I love A&M. When I retired, I came back here

23:12.637 --> 23:31.133
and I was looking for work to do and I was offered a 
teaching position over in the business school,

23:12.637 --> 23:31.133
which I did teach for one semester and realized 
that I didn't like teaching all

23:12.637 --> 23:31.133
that much. I've since gone

23:36.383 --> 23:43.592
for the university to, in some small way, try to pay 
them back for what they did for my life.
