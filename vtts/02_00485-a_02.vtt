WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:10.669
They were people who were physically 
disqualified, but for some reason that I've

00:02.073 --> 00:10.669
forgotten were still eligible to go to school. But 
just five people who were not a member of the Corps.

00:18.603 --> 00:25.195
Then everybody, essentially everyone, got equal 
treatment, whether it was mistreatment or not.

00:27.537 --> 00:36.807
But when you have a core of 2,000 or 3,000 out of 
35,000 or even out of 4,000 for that matter, that's

00:27.537 --> 00:36.807
an entirely different situation. And while I 
would like to see the benefits of what I consider

00:38.609 --> 00:55.587
benefits of hazing be a part of the school,

00:38.609 --> 00:55.587
under the conditions that we have now, I don't see 
how in the world it possibly could be.

00:56.680 --> 01:02.447
So it's for lack of an answer to that question that I 
have to agree that we shouldn't have. Okay. Now,

01:03.588 --> 01:07.133
what do you see as the benefits of hazing?

01:10.116 --> 01:22.772
Under the circumstances that it was possible to do 
so, I see I think several benefits of it.

01:23.984 --> 01:34.996
I have to

01:23.984 --> 01:34.996
say here that when I say hazing, it's not just 
hazing as such. It is the discipline that is

01:35.877 --> 01:43.685
enforced in part by hazing. Hazing becomes a part 
of that discipline. Hazing per se I don't see any

01:48.770 --> 01:51.493
benefit in. But as it relates to that discipline, 
it teaches people how to think, teach them how to be

01:53.498 --> 02:00.307
patient. It teaches how to remember names, as one 
little example. It teaches you, the young kid at

02:08.197 --> 02:20.873
that time,

02:08.197 --> 02:20.873
that damn it, you have some backbone if you can just 
find a way to use it. It teaches you you can have some

02:22.372 --> 02:24.676
patience. You don't have to blow off the handle. As 
a matter of fact, it teaches you you better find a

02:28.042 --> 02:31.567
way to do it. And a number of things that it teaches 
you, I think, that are very, very good. And they are

02:43.527 --> 02:47.434
particularly so if you're going to be into an 
occupation where these kinds of things are

02:48.308 --> 03:15.295
important, such as in the military, flying 
airplanes,

02:48.308 --> 03:15.295
in the missile business, in the space business, 
things that require really almost in some cases

02:48.308 --> 03:15.295
superhuman discipline of mind and thought, and 
certainly control of your physical actions. And I

03:16.625 --> 03:25.857
just think it contributes, properly done, 
contributes a great deal in that respect at that

03:16.625 --> 03:25.857
time in your life. Needless to say, I don't think I 
need anybody to beat me over the head at this age

03:26.978 --> 03:33.567
about that. Sounds like hazing was one of the 
things that you liked about the Corps. What were

03:38.593 --> 03:41.637
other things that you liked about being in the 
Corps? Well, yes, I did like it. I mean, I liked what

03:47.598 --> 03:51.922
I stood for, yes. I don't think it's a highlight.

03:56.387 --> 04:00.151
Well, I think I just have to say I liked almost 
everything about the Corps. It provided a means of

04:00.211 --> 04:09.480
association with others and a very

04:12.464 --> 04:13.787
constructive way. It provided the structure for 
social activities, which involved other people,

04:14.529 --> 04:30.928
bringing people from outside, girls, parents, 
spectators, all kinds of people. It provided an

04:32.917 --> 04:45.013
outlet to a great deal of knowledge and kinds of 
knowledge that most of us at that time had had no

04:32.917 --> 04:45.013
opportunity to observe, even. Unless you lived in 
San Antonio, one would probably never see a

04:47.436 --> 04:59.852
military unit, even marching, much less in 
action.

05:02.785 --> 05:06.713
And so I enjoyed the horses. I was in the field 
artillery and of course it was horse drawn at that

05:07.935 --> 05:12.063
time. Sure. And

05:12.945 --> 05:17.133
I loved horses. I had grown up with them. I had 
broken horses.

05:25.415 --> 05:29.383
So that was very interesting. As a result of the 
horses being available, we had horse shows,

05:29.723 --> 05:41.105
jumping contests, and all these kinds of things, 
which I participated in and won several of them.

05:41.927 --> 05:44.993
Did you like the uniform?

05:47.048 --> 06:05.297
The uniform, per se, to me was a necessity, not 
necessarily a necessary evil, but it was a

05:47.048 --> 06:05.297
necessity, and I had to admit that it

05:47.048 --> 06:05.297
was good for several other points of view. I 
certainly couldn't have bought suits or clothes

06:05.317 --> 06:12.769
to wear during that period of time.

06:13.222 --> 06:21.310
all of us, I think, would always remake whatever 
uniform we had because we didn't like the

06:13.222 --> 06:21.310
particular things about it. But we most likely 
wouldn't do any better, so that you can just say is a

06:21.330 --> 06:28.317
normal crime.

06:32.501 --> 06:37.707
Yes, overall I can say I liked the uniform. I didn't 
go out and try to strut it or anything like that, but

06:37.727 --> 06:42.992
it was distinct you. At least somebody didn't ask 
you if you were from Georgia Tech or something. You

06:50.638 --> 06:52.000
didn't come walking down the street. Was there 
anything about being in the Corps that you

06:53.462 --> 06:55.805
disliked?

07:03.195 --> 07:04.297
No, I don't think so. When I was a brand new freshman 
I could think of several things, but overall I

07:05.478 --> 07:12.608
don't think there was nothing that that I didn't 
like about it. Did you ever gain a position of

07:14.601 --> 07:17.777
leadership in the Corps? Well, I guess it depends 
on

07:23.590 --> 07:25.112
what they call leadership. I thought so. What was 
it? In my junior year, I was the first sergeant of

07:29.960 --> 07:36.870
this Battery D field artillery. And in my senior 
year, I was the battalion commander of the second

07:38.132 --> 07:48.128
battalion of field artillery.

07:48.148 --> 07:49.630
Those are pretty coveted jobs. I don't know I'm 
always interested in when young men start to

07:51.620 --> 07:59.328
assume, young men who become generals start to 
assume leadership roles. When was that for you?

08:06.515 --> 08:09.378
Oh, I guess it was while I was here. In the Corps. I 
think so. I think so.

08:18.727 --> 08:20.749
I'm thinking back on your career. What ways do you 
think that being in the Corps helped you become a

08:21.708 --> 08:27.453
general?

08:33.799 --> 08:43.307
I think it taught

08:33.799 --> 08:43.307
one how to recognize things that were important at 
an earlier time. It

08:43.367 --> 08:50.213
also taught that there was an answer to a problem if 
it came up and it gave you a direction to go and and

08:51.863 --> 09:17.314
solving that problem not an understanding of 
people

08:51.863 --> 09:17.314
but i think one's effectiveness in

08:51.863 --> 09:17.314
getting to the bottom of most any problem as an 
understanding of the people who are working with

09:18.678 --> 09:33.262
that problem, and the people who have to be 
convinced about it in order to get a solution to it.

09:33.282 --> 09:42.897
And one's association in the core

09:33.282 --> 09:42.897
certainly helped with that knowledge, helped 
develop that knowledge.

09:49.728 --> 09:55.477
both with respect to those that you're working 
with as well as those you were working for.

10:00.986 --> 10:02.268
So it helped you deal with people. Yes. Know 
people, understand people.

10:11.162 --> 10:15.128
Most of the problems have to do with just that. Do 
you think that there was any way in which being in

10:17.335 --> 10:23.141
the Corps hindered your career?

10:26.604 --> 10:30.027
No, I can't think of any way that it could have 
hindered my career. Not in any way. Okay. Do you

10:32.730 --> 10:40.398
think it had, you've already said that it seemed to 
have some impact on your becoming a leader. Yes, I

10:41.318 --> 10:44.001
think it had a very substantial impact.

10:47.744 --> 10:49.848
Okay. Let's talk for a minute about the 
professional soldiers that were at A&M at the

10:49.868 --> 10:54.115
time. Do you remember any of these professional 
soldiers and how did they help you? I certainly do

10:58.142 --> 10:59.203
remember.

11:04.252 --> 11:06.616
They helped me in many ways. The commandant at the 
time was a man, Colonel Nelson. known as Bull

11:15.233 --> 11:23.381
Nelson because he was the commandant and 
therefore the bull, but and needless to say I

11:15.233 --> 11:23.381
didn't get to know him very well.

11:26.584 --> 11:42.540
The tactical officer for the field artillery was a 
major Sloan at that time, a very exacting and

11:26.584 --> 11:42.540
good field artillery officer. The tactical 
officer of our, my unit

11:43.837 --> 11:53.054
was a Captain T.C. Harry

11:53.274 --> 12:04.495
and he was an older officer, retired shortly after 
he left A&M.

12:07.478 --> 12:30.904
but an absolutely wonderful man with a wonderful 
wife and he was here the whole four years that I was

12:07.478 --> 12:30.904
here and I think some while after I was gone but at 
least for those four years and while I was here I met

12:07.478 --> 12:30.904
a girl over in Huntsville who was later my wife and 
she came over to visit me at various times and would

12:31.289 --> 12:34.372
stay at their house. They lived off campus in 
what's now the town of Palisades, the city of

12:34.412 --> 12:40.579
Palisades.

12:44.383 --> 12:51.430
And so I got to know them as wonderful people, real 
fine people. The title clause for the Corps of

12:51.450 --> 12:58.377
Engineers here at the time was Captain Pick. who 
was later General Pick and in charge of building

12:59.690 --> 13:10.284
the Burma Road, and later still of course became 
chief of engineers. When Captain Pick was

13:11.526 --> 13:27.688
here as a captain, and I was first sergeant of a 
battery,

13:11.526 --> 13:27.688
we had a substantial disagreement about who was 
present for Reveille. and

13:29.390 --> 13:35.176
he raised an uncommon amount of hell about it. With 
the result that I had to go to Major Sloan, who was a

13:37.738 --> 13:47.828
field artillery officer and explain it, which I 
did. And got the thing cleared up, but with some

13:47.868 --> 13:53.574
pretty hard feelings.

13:56.457 --> 13:57.878
When I was in India,

14:00.305 --> 14:05.090
as Deputy Chief of Operations for the Air Force. 
Colonel Pick was working on the Verma Road and I

14:07.373 --> 14:19.927
went down to see him as a Brigadier General to talk 
with him. We got things straightened out,

14:19.947 --> 14:29.518
everything was fine, but it was kind of an ironic 
meeting.

14:30.562 --> 14:38.915
Major Sloan went on to Italy during the war and had 
command of a division there. I didn't find out what

14:40.858 --> 14:49.912
happened to him after the war, so I don't know where 
he was, but he was a major general there in command

14:40.858 --> 14:49.912
of the division and the last I heard of him. A real 
fine man. What influence did they have on you?

15:00.970 --> 15:04.635
Well, different in all of the cases, I guess. Major 
Sloan left a lasting impression of military

15:06.518 --> 15:14.289
efficiency in my mind.

15:19.296 --> 15:29.290
And Captain Harry, one of adequate military 
efficiency, but one of deep human understanding.

15:30.485 --> 15:36.191
both qualities were very good, I thought. They 
were very plus. And

15:38.573 --> 15:49.423
I noticed the same qualities in varying degrees 
with the other types of classes. There were

15:49.443 --> 15:53.267
several others here, not just those three that I 
mentioned. How about the quality of training, as

15:53.287 --> 15:56.991
far as the artillery was concerned? I thought it 
was very good. very good. In retrospect, I don't

16:00.342 --> 16:08.406
quite see how it was so good because it was quite 
realistic with all things considered. We had the

16:09.618 --> 16:22.069
guns, the caissons, the horses, the harness, the 
everything else, and we hooked them up and drilled

16:09.618 --> 16:22.069
them and deployed and did all the things that you 
would do in war, including firing. We didn't fire

16:22.089 --> 16:26.333
here, we fired over at Camp Bullock, but we did 
everything. And I thought the quality of the

16:26.373 --> 16:29.015
training was very good.

16:32.038 --> 16:39.304
It was the tools that you work with, and a number of 
other things changed a long time before World War

16:32.038 --> 16:39.304
II came on. Sure, absolutely. It was still fairly 
good. What did you think of the quality of Second

16:43.764 --> 16:47.831
Lieutenant that came out of A&M back then? Well, 
since I was one of them, I thought it was very high.

16:55.865 --> 16:58.710
But watching it since that time, I still think it's 
very high, very high by comparison to others.

17:04.749 --> 17:06.231
Okay, let's compare it with some of the others. 
Let's compare it with some of the other ROTC

17:06.271 --> 17:18.204
schools like VMI or some of the others like 
Virginia Tech or Georgia Tech. Well, I've had some

17:18.224 --> 17:27.634
jobs since then that put me in contact with those 
various schools in their ROTC matters and all. and

17:28.559 --> 17:37.510
without any desire to be derogatory in the 
slightest way, because they have some wonderful

17:28.559 --> 17:37.510
people and a wonderful program. Most of them just 
do not have the capacity to expose their students,

17:39.352 --> 17:57.294
young second lieutenants coming up, to the kind of 
experiences and realism that we have here to do.

17:57.334 --> 17:58.515
They just can't do it. all these things cost money,

17:59.440 --> 18:24.857
and it's a very precious commodity in most of these 
places, because the military schools all over the

17:59.440 --> 18:24.857
country just do not get the kind of support that 
they need to have, and don't get the kind of support

17:59.440 --> 18:24.857
that A&M provides for itself in one way or another.

18:27.048 --> 18:29.650
So I still think they're the best. When I say 
comparative,

18:29.690 --> 18:39.059
the one out of West Point doesn't have any edge on 
these as far as I know. Okay, so let's talk for a

18:39.079 --> 18:42.622
minute about the ones out of West Point. How would 
you compare their training? I haven't been

18:46.766 --> 18:48.928
through West Point training. No, but of course 
you've met tons of West Point second lieutenants.

18:52.711 --> 18:53.912
And you've had them work for you. Yes, I have.

18:58.182 --> 19:01.145
they are very good and they are very well trained.

19:03.728 --> 19:08.894
But I don't feel that they're any better trained 
than they are out of A&M. And

19:08.914 --> 19:26.094
in terms of their relationship with people, I'm 
not sure they're as astute or as sensitive to it as

19:08.914 --> 19:26.094
our people out of here are. What do you mean by that? 
If you're attuned to

19:28.625 --> 19:53.687
deal with people,

19:28.625 --> 19:53.687
when someone discusses something with you, you 
can be sympathetic enough to understand his

19:28.625 --> 19:53.687
thinking and to have the proper respect for 
whether you agree with it or not. Having done so,

19:54.882 --> 20:04.378
then, you're in a very much better position to 
influence this thinking to what it is that you want

19:54.882 --> 20:04.378
it to be to get your job done, whatever that is. I 
just don't think a lot of the people in West Point

20:05.660 --> 20:18.561
can reach out and grasp this in a real 
understanding way, and therefore not quite as

20:05.660 --> 20:18.561
effective.

20:21.950 --> 20:30.439
an A&M second lieutenant or an officer come on a 
base and live with the people for a week, he usually

20:21.950 --> 20:30.439
got them all in his hands.

20:34.002 --> 20:35.844
The West Pointer, of course, some of them do. 
They're exceptions to all of them. But most of them

20:37.946 --> 20:42.851
are busy with other things and they aren't looking 
too closely at that. And we don't really have that

20:44.212 --> 20:51.720
rapport with the rest of the people they're 
associated with. Often I've heard from military

20:54.586 --> 21:02.136
men that there's a West Point club, a Ringknockers 
club, and all of this stuff. What do you think about

21:02.336 --> 21:03.978
that? Well,

21:03.998 --> 21:11.187
I know that there is some of that. I've never been 
really faced with it in any way that was bad, and so I

21:11.588 --> 21:19.598
really don't have much thought about it. overall I 
think it's not a good idea, but I can't cite that as

21:20.371 --> 21:25.978
an example of why it isn't. But as far as career 
advancement is concerned, do you think that West

21:25.998 --> 21:33.887
Point people are favored over A&M as far as 
advancing in the military? Well, I have to say it

21:35.169 --> 21:46.803
depends on how many of their class are in 
controlling positions when their number comes up

21:35.169 --> 21:46.803
for promotion. Certainly there is some some 
influence there. Overall, generally, I think

21:53.741 --> 21:57.287
it's not really too significant.

22:00.432 --> 22:05.139
But there is some.

22:05.159 --> 22:14.695
I think the important thing there is that in our 
military we keep a relative balance so that you

22:05.159 --> 22:14.695
essentially eliminate that problem. What do you 
mean a relative balance? Well, if Air Force, for

22:16.886 --> 22:35.874
example, if they were composed entirely of West 
Pointers or now Air Academy people,

22:16.886 --> 22:35.874
there just wouldn't be room for guys from A&M or 
other places. And they wouldn't get promoted, not

22:35.894 --> 22:42.744
because people were trying to deal unfair with 
them. It just doesn't work that way. As a practical

22:45.623 --> 22:50.128
matter, it doesn't work that way. So, I think it 
important to Air Force that they have infused into

22:50.148 --> 23:12.812
their organization at all levels enough people to 
keep this sort of thing from happening, whether it

22:50.148 --> 23:12.812
be dominated by the Air Academy or dominated by A&M 
or whoever. If we can keep enough in there to keep a

23:13.231 --> 23:21.440
balance,

23:13.231 --> 23:21.440
then it'll never be a problem. Let's talk about 
your academic career at A&M.

23:26.705 --> 23:29.448
What did you think of the quality of your 
professors? Did you get very close to any of them? I

23:34.434 --> 23:38.378
did get very close to them.

23:42.678 --> 23:45.782
in the classroom sense. I didn't get close to it 
socially or anything like that. But I must say that

23:50.507 --> 24:11.892
as far as I'm concerned I had, for the most part, in 
my professors, the most wonderful people I've

23:50.507 --> 24:11.892
ever known, the most dedicated people I've ever 
known, and very knowledgeable people, and they

23:50.507 --> 24:11.892
would do nearly anything to see that you learned 
what it was they were trying to teach.

24:20.817 --> 24:37.720
And in chemical engineering, I had

24:20.817 --> 24:37.720
the same professors a lot more, I think, than you 
would have now in most courses. And some of them as

24:37.740 --> 24:42.587
much as three years I'd have a course under them all 
the time for three years, which I did have in the

24:43.664 --> 24:53.621
case of Dr. Bauer and Dr. Jensen and some others.

24:57.208 --> 25:03.799
And I just thought that I can't say enough good 
things about them in terms of how they went about

25:05.045 --> 25:10.012
their job, their dedication to their job, and 
their ability as teachers. Then they were good.

25:13.137 --> 25:16.803
You didn't have this problem around here, though, 
that you have now. I mean, if you didn't want to

25:16.823 --> 25:23.953
learn, no one was going to waste thirty minutes 
fiddling with you. If you wanted to work and learn,

25:23.973 --> 25:27.258
then you were willing really to work. Now, they'd 
stay up all night or anything else you want. But

25:31.775 --> 25:36.722
they didn't have time to fiddle with anybody who 
was even lukewarm about it. You'd just get a zero

25:38.105 --> 25:43.813
and go explain to somebody else why. Usually that 
was a one-way ticket home. What did you think of

25:47.559 --> 25:50.423
your student colleagues? Do you think they were 
pretty good students? Were they really trying

25:53.127 --> 25:54.930
hard? The people who were here? Yes,

25:56.917 --> 26:08.670
if you remember in 28 to 32, it was about the 
roughest, well I guess that the nation is known, I

25:56.917 --> 26:08.670
don't know. And the people that were here were 
mostly just by the skin of their teeth

26:09.812 --> 26:16.239
financially. And if they didn't want to be here, 
And one mention of this to most of their fathers,

26:21.421 --> 26:25.986
I'm sure would have got them home in a hell of a 
hurry. So as far as I'm concerned, the people who

26:27.288 --> 26:49.993
were here as students at that time with just almost 
negligible exception were really top notch

26:27.288 --> 26:49.993
people in terms of wanting to do, wanting to learn, 
and working real hard at doing that.

26:50.632 --> 26:58.521
guess it's probably overall the hardest working 
bunch of people that have probably ever been here.

26:58.541 --> 27:03.947
It was pretty tough going as far as just making ends 
meet. The school did everything in the world to

27:04.968 --> 27:13.658
help us all, individually or otherwise, just to 
stay here. Do you think that they did a good job as

27:13.678 --> 27:16.220
far as educating you? Did you feel prepared to go 
out and be an engineer when you were finished? Yes,

27:21.091 --> 27:25.518
I may have been under some kind of illusion, but I 
felt like an engineer. And I didn't get a chance to

27:26.720 --> 27:37.759
prove it, because in 32, when I graduated, there 
was absolutely no one that had a job to go to to find

27:26.720 --> 27:37.759
out. As far as I know, not one of my class had a job. 
Not even one. They want most of them home to work in

27:44.497 --> 27:53.045
their father's business or something else, just 
because there were no jobs. When I was a junior, I

27:53.065 --> 27:58.169
had the promise of three jobs open to me as soon as I 
graduated. They were anxious to have me. But hell,

28:01.212 --> 28:06.217
even the guys that were hiring me were not even 
there when I graduated. No kidding. They'd been

28:06.897 --> 28:11.922
closed down.

28:14.517 --> 28:17.061
things were in pretty bad shape.

28:20.426 --> 28:25.513
I went back to San Angelo and took a job with the 
Texas Public Service Company. It was a gas company

28:26.154 --> 28:29.860
at the time. Digging a ditch for two dollars a day as 
a chemical engineer. And I expect I was doing just

28:36.830 --> 28:40.255
about as well as most of the rest of my classmates.

28:43.795 --> 28:46.258
The jobs just were not there. Often during 
conversations you hear people say that there's

28:47.280 --> 28:55.030
something special or something unique about 
Texas A&M. Do you think there is something

28:55.591 --> 29:01.739
special?

29:01.759 --> 29:05.845
Yes, I think the whole school is special. If it were 
just a special thing it probably wouldn't last.

29:12.348 --> 29:20.580
It's a whole combination of things that make it 
special.

29:20.600 --> 29:32.618
One, I think, of the biggest of those in the 
beginning and on through to now has been the

29:20.600 --> 29:32.618
military and the discipline that is involved in 
it. I know a lot of people are not interested in

29:32.638 --> 29:37.866
hearing that, but it's still a fact. the further we 
go away from it, the less individual it's going to

29:38.943 --> 29:45.893
be, or the less special it's going to be.

29:49.459 --> 29:56.649
Maybe there's something else that can generate a 
special condition, but right off hand I can't

29:49.459 --> 29:56.649
think what it's going to be. But it provided a means 
for people to get to, people meaning students, to

30:09.149 --> 30:19.343
be forced to know each other, and to be forced to 
learn some things that their families couldn't

30:09.149 --> 30:19.343
teach them, and to get on their own feet early.

30:23.408 --> 30:26.312
And then I think that makes for a special 
situation.

30:29.597 --> 30:37.047
Because despite the fact that a lot of the schools 
in Texas used to like to compare us farm boys and

30:38.157 --> 31:01.718
people from the dairy barns, even to the extent of 
saying that we smell that way,

30:38.157 --> 31:01.718
the NMP people still stood out in groups that 
included students from other colleges.

31:04.786 --> 31:17.038
That's not to say that they weren't fine guys in 
other colleges, but overall the N.M. guy still

31:04.786 --> 31:17.038
stood out.

31:17.058 --> 31:19.361
He didn't always smell like a red bar. I was 
wondering about your military colonel. Let's

31:23.865 --> 31:25.907
start in on that. In 1932 you graduated and then you 
first started your air training in 1933. During

31:36.149 --> 31:38.934
that one year interval then you were digging 
ditches. That's right. How did you get into the

31:40.917 --> 31:42.921
Army Air Corps? Half of them. I graduated to 
troubleshooters helper before I got to the end of

31:44.223 --> 31:51.335
that year. How did I do that? How did you get into the 
Army Air Corps?

32:00.372 --> 32:17.487
While we were still here at A&M my senior year, a 
commander of

32:00.372 --> 32:17.487
D Battery, a man named Amy of Louisiana was just 
living until he could get out of here and get into

32:00.372 --> 32:17.487
flying.

32:21.584 --> 32:28.192
they gave a physical exam before he graduated from 
here, and he failed it. He was turned down for

32:28.733 --> 32:36.102
entrance to flying school.

32:36.122 --> 32:48.537
And

32:36.122 --> 32:48.537
trying to console him when he got that news, which 
was pretty hefty news when that's the only job that

32:36.122 --> 32:48.537
you've got any prospect of getting. I said, well,

32:51.098 --> 33:02.153
maybe you aren't so broken up, beat up physically, 
that you can't find yourself a reasonable job

32:51.098 --> 33:02.153
somewhere else.

33:05.798 --> 33:14.811
He took it a little bit differently than I intended 
it, and said, hell, I'll bet you fifty bucks you

33:05.798 --> 33:14.811
can't pass the physical either. Well, I didn't 
have that in mind, but so I told him I could, and I'd

33:16.428 --> 33:23.376
take it then. So I applied, and it took almost a 
year, about eight months before I heard from him.

33:32.846 --> 33:36.931
And it was a long application to fill out. Well, as I 
began to get closer to this, then I began to really

33:36.951 --> 33:43.178
be interested in, sure enough, not only passing 
the physical, but everything else it took to go on

33:43.428 --> 33:48.874
and get into it and get started.

33:53.119 --> 34:08.878
And so following up that application then, I was 
notified, I don't know when November I believe it

33:53.119 --> 34:08.878
was, that I could report to Randolph for a physical 
exam.

34:11.710 --> 34:12.731
at a certain time. I went down to Randolph, and 
there were 600 people reporting in there in three

34:12.831 --> 34:20.860
days for the same physics exam for the same class. 
No kidding. And what was the size of the class? The

34:23.142 --> 34:26.045
class was going to be about 200. And that

34:26.225 --> 34:38.578
600 had already been weeded out of like 12,000 
applications. many of whom had taken the exams

34:39.233 --> 34:52.770
locally, physical exams, locally in Minneapolis 
or wherever, and these were the ones that had

34:39.233 --> 34:52.770
survived that. So, they were 600 out of a real big 
group.

35:03.164 --> 35:08.110
So, reported down there for that physical at the 
proper time, and At the end of the first day, there

35:09.035 --> 35:19.290
were about 20 of us left that hadn't been told we 
were going home.

35:22.134 --> 35:28.223
At the end of the second day, there were eight of us 
left.

35:28.243 --> 35:35.754
And at the end of the third day, or noon on the third 
day, when they finally got through, there were

35:28.243 --> 35:35.754
still these same eight of us left. So, eight of us 
got in out of that 600. And

35:39.190 --> 35:46.196
we didn't know it then. They just told us that 
they'd pass us on a physical. But we were notified

35:50.720 --> 35:59.869
in January, I guess it was, to report on February 
20, 1933, which we did. And that year,

36:08.941 --> 36:17.436
graduates of West Point and Naval Academy, there 
was not enough money to commission

36:08.941 --> 36:17.436
them. So the Naval Academy commissioned its upper 
half, upper half of its class.

36:25.170 --> 36:33.244
The Air Force offered the other Naval Academy 
graduates, those that were not commissioned, an

36:35.013 --> 36:43.583
opportunity to go through flying school if they 
could pass the physical and other things, and be

36:35.013 --> 36:43.583
commissioned in the Air Force Reserve. Well 
fifty-something, fifty-two or three of them took

36:46.066 --> 36:59.142
advantage of this opportunity, and so they were, 
that group was there in my class in flying school.

36:59.303 --> 36:59.603
So that's some of the vacancies went to try to take 
care of that.

37:12.645 --> 37:22.460
To indicate how bad things really were, we went on 
through our year of training and there was not

37:12.645 --> 37:22.460
money enough to commission us our second 
lieutenant. When you finished? When we finished.

37:24.763 --> 37:29.590
We went to active duty as cadets for a year, that's 
right.

37:32.337 --> 37:49.456
Well,

37:32.337 --> 37:49.456
it happened that on the day that we graduated, my 
class graduated, was the day that Franklin

37:32.337 --> 37:49.456
Roosevelt ordered the Air Force Corps to take over 
the mail.

37:54.061 --> 37:59.847
So, I found myself a few days later, never having 
been west of El Paso or north of Amarillo, flying a

38:00.738 --> 38:10.266
mail from Cheyenne, Wyoming to Salt Lake City, 
Utah in open cockpit airplanes for $75 a month,

38:00.738 --> 38:10.266
less 15%. Why less? One of the economy measures 
that was taken during that year was to cut all

38:13.809 --> 38:22.777
military pay by 15%. Just didn't have the money in 
the budget to pay it. So all of us were reduced 15%.

38:31.282 --> 38:35.306
When you're on 75 bucks a month, they get it reduced 
15%.

38:36.567 --> 38:37.088
It hurts.

38:41.112 --> 38:50.462
And so you graduated from the Air Corps Flying 
School in February 20th, 1934, and how long did you

38:41.112 --> 38:50.462
fly the mail? Well, they took the mail over that 
day. The Air Corps took it over that day. And I went

38:58.265 --> 39:06.397
from Randolph, where we graduated, or from Kelly, 
where we graduated to Marchfield for a station in

38:58.265 --> 39:06.397
California, and then moved on up. So, it was a month 
after that before I got even close to the mail.

39:15.290 --> 39:24.964
And we finished flying the mail on July 25th, and so 
it was like two and a half months. Now, I've heard

39:25.248 --> 39:32.854
some pretty negative responses about flying the 
mail, the Army Air Corps. And as I understand,

39:32.874 --> 39:36.878
there was a high casualty rate. There was a very 
high casualty rate. You betcha.

39:42.803 --> 39:44.364
Why was that? Why was there a high casualty rate? 
Yeah. What were the problems? You're all

39:49.088 --> 39:50.629
certified pilots. There were three or four 
reasons. There were. One of them is that it turned

39:55.370 --> 40:12.746
out that during that period of time they had the 
worst weather for flying that I guess they've ever

39:55.370 --> 40:12.746
had before or since that anyone knows about. It was 
really bad. But that's not the primary reason. The

40:19.312 --> 40:22.255
primary reason was that We had been so strapped for 
money, the armed services had been, the Air Corps

40:22.488 --> 40:33.045
in particular, that we didn't have the equipment 
to do it. The equipment that we're using, of

40:33.986 --> 40:36.671
course, was not made for it. No. We were not 
equipped in terms of navigation aids, which is the

40:38.674 --> 40:47.027
main reason for it. either in terms of having the 
equipment, having it installed in the airplane,

40:48.020 --> 40:56.412
or having the training for it.

40:56.432 --> 41:03.543
Well, I took off from Salt Lake City in a big Curtis 
B-2 bomber that I'd never been in before. It was the

41:04.885 --> 41:10.493
biggest airplane that the United States owned at 
that time. On the floor of the cockpit over in front

41:10.513 --> 41:16.322
of my crew chief was a box about like this. And I 
asked the cruiser what it was, and he said, that's

41:17.821 --> 41:24.511
so you can receive the beam. Well, that's the first 
time I ever heard of a beam, so I don't know what the

41:26.835 --> 41:34.426
hell that meant either.

41:34.446 --> 41:42.478
Well, it turns out, when I got an education on it 
before I got back onto an airplane, after I finally

41:34.446 --> 41:42.478
got down that night,

41:46.019 --> 41:57.294
they had installed these stations that 
transmitted in eight elliptical transmission

41:46.019 --> 41:57.294
patterns. This one and this one were A, this one and 
this one were N. And if you were in the shadow

41:58.275 --> 42:07.968
between them, you got a solid signal. If you set the 
station up and you set the shadow so it would write

42:09.370 --> 42:14.136
down your airway, you could come in following that 
steady signal and come into the station and you'd

42:15.770 --> 42:22.078
know you were there. There wasn't a lot more to it 
than that, but that's the theory. So you'd know

42:27.264 --> 42:28.986
that you were approaching that city. That's 
right, and you'd know which one it was. The

42:33.292 --> 42:44.646
technique of doing this, though, on bad weather, 
bad static, and swinging beams, and all kinds of

42:33.292 --> 42:44.646
other things, is another matter.

42:45.014 --> 42:49.160
how you know you're there, because you can fly 
through that cone in less than a second. And this

42:50.001 --> 42:58.734
one going out the other way sounds exactly the 
same, unless you check to see whether you've got an

42:50.001 --> 42:58.734
A or an N on your right and so forth. I mean, you have 
to orient yourself. But if you didn't even know

43:00.697 --> 43:05.003
what it was, you certainly didn't know how to use 
it. That's for sure. And most of us were in that kind

43:06.245 --> 43:08.428
of category. We hadn't even seen one yet. So the 
training was another reason for our high-tech

43:10.681 --> 43:14.486
solar grid. Oh, yes. We didn't have that to train 
on. We were flying in airplanes whose service

43:20.054 --> 43:28.186
ceiling wasn't as high as the mountains on the 
routes that we were flying.

43:31.972 --> 43:35.256
It was a real rough decision. I don't mind to say 
that now, that the President ought to be for making

43:38.845 --> 43:42.028
that kind of decision or anything like that. It had 
some good things, too. It did, as I understand,

43:44.430 --> 43:55.201
break the airline monopoly that they had,

43:44.430 --> 43:55.201
which could have caused, did cause a hell of a 
problem. But it also showed the Air Force and

43:55.221 --> 44:04.870
showed the world that unless you did something, 
you just didn't have an Air Force. You can't win a

44:06.824 --> 44:12.192
war in PT with threes.

44:12.212 --> 44:13.074
What about the morale? We began to get some, it was 
terrible in many ways. The pilot morale? Well,

44:21.346 --> 44:33.024
it was good despite the fact, I've forgotten how 
many we lost, but it was like 80 or so pilots. You

44:33.044 --> 44:35.127
lost 80 just from California? No, not just Cal. I'm 
talking about all over. Okay. And I don't know that

44:38.361 --> 44:48.355
that's any, I don't, that's not an exact figure, 
but it's close to that.

44:48.375 --> 45:01.553
But we understood why we lost them and we just tried 
every way in the world that we could try to assure

44:48.375 --> 45:01.553
that we weren't the next one and So was the pilot 
morale good then or bad? You said horrible at

45:05.312 --> 45:07.616
first, and I said I was a morale man. No, you said I 
was a morale man. I was thinking about overall,

45:09.578 --> 45:12.903
everybody, and I said terrible. Okay, so overall 
it was different then? Yeah. The pilot morale, as

45:17.189 --> 45:19.853
such, I think was very good. Very good. Why was it 
different between the entire Army Air Corps and

45:21.515 --> 45:30.848
the pilots?

45:32.279 --> 45:34.361
people just didn't see very much sense in it. Yet 
the pilot saw that it was extremely important

45:36.003 --> 46:01.307
because it was going to have to tell us what we had to 
do, and it was going to have to tell the nation what

45:36.003 --> 46:01.307
it was going to have to do before

45:36.003 --> 46:01.307
we could be a fighting unit.

46:02.283 --> 46:03.304
I think it was good. I lost some mighty good friends 
and damn near became one of them myself. You had a

46:10.493 --> 46:11.374
close call? Oh yeah, well I've had several. Where 
was that? It was Salt Lake City.

46:23.729 --> 46:29.877
I'd come in to land and just a cold that couldn't 
retain your consciousness and
