WEBVTT

00:08.975 --> 00:10.658
Okay. Where will local school board members 
receive the training that is required by the State

00:10.678 --> 00:30.433
Board of Education?

00:30.453 --> 00:30.713
I don't know. I

00:32.566 --> 00:55.141
don't have any plans as

00:32.566 --> 00:55.141
to how that will occur. That will have to be built in 
to the state's plans, like how to implement that

00:55.161 --> 00:58.867
piece of legislation. How that will be designed 
and I

01:00.427 --> 01:25.899
had

01:00.427 --> 01:25.899
no

01:00.427 --> 01:25.899
idea as to how this would happen at all. I imagine 
that it will vary from one district to another and

01:25.919 --> 01:28.442
it will cost the

01:29.333 --> 01:33.338
money. I don't know the exact amount that's been

01:33.358 --> 01:47.497
appropriated

01:33.358 --> 01:47.497
for them. Have they started this training yet? Uh, 
see I don't have any access to the information

01:49.260 --> 01:50.641
about what I have. I had my friends come in and give 
me some information. except

01:53.330 --> 02:15.211
for those that we had been specifically studying 
at Texas A&M. We did a study on the way the career

02:15.231 --> 02:19.995
ladder was being implemented, the way 
performance appraisal was being implemented,

02:15.231 --> 02:19.995
and we've taken a look at what people think about an 
entrepreneurship equation and advanced

02:15.231 --> 02:19.995
academic training. Some

02:21.308 --> 02:42.278
of us have

02:21.308 --> 02:42.278
been participating in a group called Epsom's 
Equality Education. But if you want an oral

02:42.298 --> 02:49.088
history of the committee, this question of how the 
recommendation is being implemented, in our

02:42.298 --> 02:49.088
features, they're not really linked to the 
committee. That's only one .

02:57.281 --> 03:14.578
OK. Why is a master teacher exam required in order 
for teachers to be assigned to level four on the

02:57.281 --> 03:14.578
career lab? Let me raise a question about what 
you're trying

03:14.599 --> 03:19.003
to get at. Ask me why. an exam is required presumes a 
number of things. It presumes, I think it's a good

03:29.415 --> 03:45.118
idea, which I don't, it presumes that all the 
members of the committee voted for all the

03:29.415 --> 03:45.118
recommendations, which they didn't. There were 
many votes. There were 14 to 6. There were many

03:48.903 --> 03:50.125
different items that were voted. And a

03:50.746 --> 04:05.226
number of those were six people who voted against 
the recommendation. So I can't tell you why. The

04:06.508 --> 04:13.197
reason, the reason why is because the law, the 
legislation, asked the legislation to require

04:06.508 --> 04:13.197
it. That's why it's going to be done. Now whether I 
think it's a good idea or not, I'd be happy to

04:16.362 --> 04:20.247
comment on it, right? I

04:20.918 --> 04:40.428
don't think it's a very good idea. I think there are 
other ways to determine whether teachers are

04:40.448 --> 04:42.652
competent, besides doing a certain basic skill. 
You know, 20 years after they graduate, and

04:42.672 --> 04:45.857
they've done a very good amount of work, and many of 
them are very good teachers. You know, it's a waste

04:45.877 --> 04:48.040
of money, financially, to presume that all 
210,000 teachers are

04:48.779 --> 04:56.406
not competent to teach. You've

04:56.666 --> 05:02.911
got to give them this basic skillset plan. It's 
going to cost $14 million to test these teachers,

05:03.452 --> 05:14.341
many of whom already have master's degrees and 
have already taken many courses in which they've

05:03.452 --> 05:14.341
demonstrated that they can spell and read and 
write. Many of them have taken the graduate record

05:14.361 --> 05:17.824
at the time at the universities that they 
attended. Those teachers

05:18.513 --> 05:25.302
don't need to be tested anymore. And it's a slap in 
the face to a teacher who has a certificate. If you

05:29.948 --> 05:39.981
say, you know, we're going to give you this one 
test, and if you don't pass it, even if you freeze on

05:29.948 --> 05:39.981
it, which is much better for some teachers, 
because so much will be riding on it, if you don't

05:29.948 --> 05:39.981
take your You don't do that with lawyers or doctors 
or anybody else. Another example of how the

05:52.728 --> 05:57.073
society mistreats its people. And I didn't vote 
for that, I didn't do it. In fact, I called the

05:58.135 --> 06:04.703
president of the Educational Testing Service and 
asked him to And he told me

06:05.999 --> 06:28.277
over the phone, and I reiterated

06:05.999 --> 06:28.277
it to

06:05.999 --> 06:28.277
the committee,

06:29.843 --> 06:39.175
That's what he said, that Abram would not allow 
that test to be used by anybody who flew to keep it in

06:29.843 --> 06:39.175
the mainland, because the test was not a test of 
Goblin, it was a test of Goblin. And if the test was

06:40.677 --> 06:50.791
used in that way, it would be bad for the testing 
company, because it would not be creditable. They

06:50.811 --> 06:55.117
would not be using the test for what it was 
intended. And they refused to let Houston use it,

06:58.565 --> 07:13.959
and they would not allow

06:58.565 --> 07:13.959
the state of

06:58.565 --> 07:13.959
Arkansas to use their test. Furthermore, he said 
that if any teacher was excluded using their test,

07:15.141 --> 07:25.290
they would appear as a witness in court for the 
teacher, not for the school district. So I played,

07:25.310 --> 07:27.272
I told all the members of the committee, what the 
president of the largest test and test

07:27.742 --> 07:39.573
corporation in the United States has said about 
testing teachers. And they've only four, three,

07:39.593 --> 07:44.058
or six to do it anyway. And the reasoning behind 
that has a lot more to do with politics. The

07:51.885 --> 07:55.048
politicians feel they need something to 
demonstrate to the public that they're going to

07:55.670 --> 08:03.460
find out whether their tax increase is worth it. In 
other words, whether it improves the quality of

08:03.941 --> 08:10.810
the school. If you put more money in to keep the 
salary, what do you get for it? And the fastest

08:14.194 --> 08:20.102
thing they go to to demonstrate quality is a test. 
And toughness. Get tough, get test. Well,

08:23.665 --> 08:33.982
improving quality of life is more complicated 
than just being tough. And if people go to school

08:34.182 --> 08:42.076
and threaten you, it benefits a lot to do with 
making things better rather than making things

08:34.182 --> 08:42.076
tough. Just requiring more of something doesn't 
make it better. Unless you change the interaction

08:46.122 --> 08:48.947
between the teacher, the student, and the 
curriculum, you really haven't accomplished the

08:49.653 --> 08:56.561
whole lot. You've got to get really good teachers. 
And you don't get good teachers just by giving

09:01.627 --> 09:07.034
them, like, uh, cuts on paper cuts. You get good 
teachers by using that $14 million to set up

09:07.054 --> 09:10.638
intensive training programs. You can find out 
whether a teacher can teach their subject to the

09:10.658 --> 09:14.142
students by going into their class. And in the 
performance appraisal instrument that states

09:15.488 --> 09:29.523
with and with and none, that's number nine in the 
list of competencies that they require teachers

09:15.488 --> 09:29.523
to demonstrate. So they have a method for 
determining whether the teacher knows enough

09:29.543 --> 09:37.472
about their

09:29.543 --> 09:37.472
subject to teach it to students. OK. This master 
teacher exam, do you know if it has been created

09:37.733 --> 09:43.639
yet, or?

09:44.648 --> 09:50.054
It all depends on which exam you're talking about. 
There will be, as a result of this legislation, 97

09:50.154 --> 09:53.697
new tests. Some of these are for students, some are 
for teachers. The tests for teachers started way

09:57.261 --> 10:03.428
back before Hospital 72. There was a bill called 
Senate Bill 50 approved in the previous

10:03.448 --> 10:13.558
legislative session that required an 
examination For teachers, prior to entry, you

10:15.192 --> 10:24.922
need to be familiar with the pre-professionals 
and skills test, it's called. You have to take that

10:24.942 --> 10:26.484
prior to getting into teacher education. And 
that's a test of math and English. Then the next

10:30.428 --> 10:34.832
test is an exit exam. And that's after the person 
completes the fourth year, prior to entry into the

10:34.852 --> 10:41.299
profession. Then there's a test. It's going to be 
given a one-shot test that will be given in March to

10:43.306 --> 10:50.156
all the current teachers. And that test is a basic 
skills test. There's another test for teachers in

10:54.722 --> 11:05.056
the career ladder plan between levels two and 
three, which is called an advanced test. Nobody

11:07.640 --> 11:09.402
knows what that means yet. In fact, nobody knows 
what levels three and four mean. They haven't been

11:12.989 --> 11:15.292
worked out yet. That's one of the things that got 
all of the experienced teachers very angry in

11:15.332 --> 11:25.344
Texas because all of the experienced teachers 
were put on level one. And then a decision was made

11:25.364 --> 11:35.816
in each of the districts because there was money 
provided over and above the regular base salary by

11:25.364 --> 11:35.816
the state. There was an advanced amount of money 
given to each district for merit. and they had to

11:39.449 --> 11:45.179
set up a system of performance or presence to 
determine which teachers received merit. But

11:46.241 --> 11:56.820
here were these teachers who'd been teaching for 
20 years, and they all were now replaced on the

11:46.241 --> 11:56.820
first level with all the beginning teachers.

12:01.709 --> 12:02.250
Okay.

12:04.711 --> 12:17.567
Do you think sometime in the future that 
first-year teachers will eventually have to have

12:04.711 --> 12:17.567
a master's degree to begin teaching as opposed to a

12:04.711 --> 12:17.567
bachelor's degree? I hope so. There is a lot of 
activity right now in the profession moving that

12:20.171 --> 12:28.081
direction. Florida has this requirement, 
five-year programs. North Carolina

12:32.369 --> 12:39.942
is moving in that direction, Oklahoma. And within 
the professional organizations, there's a new

12:39.962 --> 12:49.939
group called the Homes Group, 29 institutions, 
mostly land grant, research-oriented type

12:39.962 --> 12:49.939
universities. and the large private 
institutions, like Stanford, Columbia, New York

12:51.033 --> 13:04.134
University, Harvard, are members of this group of 
29. In fact, they're just two weeks from expanding

13:04.154 --> 13:07.920
it to 35. Their commitment is to develop five-year 
programs and also to study them, to do research on

13:07.940 --> 13:18.036
teacher education. In addition to that, they have 
as a goal to set up a set of standards which they will

13:19.332 --> 13:29.166
apply to themselves.

13:29.186 --> 13:37.599
Now, there are something like 1,340

13:29.186 --> 13:37.599
institutions in the United States . And this group 
is saying, look, to try to get all 1,340

13:37.619 --> 13:48.715
of these institutions that meet these standards 
is impossible. Those outstanding universities

13:49.505 --> 14:01.384
that are already research-oriented 
universities, committed to quality and

13:49.505 --> 14:01.384
committed to research, ought to be doing this kind 
of thing. They ought to be setting up models of the

14:01.404 --> 14:08.315
best way to prepare teachers. And of course, this 
is all going to be done in a kind of context of a

14:08.335 --> 14:13.183
teacher shortage. So the conflict becomes, well, 
while you're developing these great program

14:13.973 --> 14:23.843
five-year models, there's going to be a shortage 
of teachers. Are you going to meet the demands or

14:23.863 --> 14:32.512
numbers and still move in this quality domain? The 
last meeting in Texas A&M is one of these 35 groups

14:32.532 --> 14:40.580
working with a home school. In fact, I have a 
meeting. November 11, in Washington, deal with

14:41.851 --> 14:51.286
the deans of education. I'm meeting with the 
presidents and vice presidents of their

14:51.306 --> 15:05.248
institutions at the national meeting of the land 
grant universities to discuss how to work on this

14:51.306 --> 15:05.248
whole area as a university-wide activity, rather 
than just have colleges of education involved.

15:05.268 --> 15:08.213
But the answer I'm hoping we give to that is, look, 
If we can develop high quality programs in teacher

15:09.543 --> 15:19.835
education, in the end, that will produce more 
teachers rather than less. Now, A&M is a good

15:19.855 --> 15:22.078
example of this. We have increased our teacher 
education enrollment over the last four years by

15:22.098 --> 15:29.086
34%. We have higher requirements, grade point 
average requirements, and testing requirements

15:29.106 --> 15:37.676
to get into the College of Education than other 
colleges on the campus. It doesn't hurt us at all.

15:38.697 --> 15:39.398
It helps us. We have a math science scholar loan 
program now. We have nine National Merit

15:42.976 --> 15:47.443
Scholars, eight valedictorians. We've got 30 
students on scholarships. All of this has been

15:52.209 --> 15:57.697
stimulated by commitment to quality. And I think, 
in a long run, we drive students away by law and

15:57.717 --> 16:03.425
standards. I think the school drives teachers 
away by setting up emergency permit programs or

16:06.901 --> 16:26.413
alternative certification programs where 
people get in without meeting the strict

16:06.901 --> 16:26.413
requirements of performance, demonstrated 
competence, and having completed a good subject

16:06.901 --> 16:26.413
field preparation and a good student teaching 
preparation. I think we destroy our recruitment

16:26.433 --> 16:34.005
approach when we lower standards. not when we 
increase them. And so I'm hoping that the land

16:38.692 --> 16:56.589
grant institutions can hold out on this and say, 
look, we believe it's important to prepare a group

16:38.692 --> 16:56.589
of people, teachers and professional leaders, 
and also show how it should be done and do research

16:38.692 --> 16:56.589
on it at the same time. And I think that group could 
have a major impact on the other 1,300

17:05.727 --> 17:07.469
institutions that exist. And some of those should 
go out of the business. They shouldn't be trying to

17:09.131 --> 17:20.565
prepare teachers, because in some cases, there's 
a half a faculty member trying to teach the whole

17:09.131 --> 17:20.565
science

17:09.131 --> 17:20.565
group. How do you feel about all teachers and 
administrators having to take the competency

17:20.585 --> 17:28.735
exam in March 1986? I don't think it's a good method 
for determining teacher competence. And it's not

17:34.972 --> 17:41.058
done in any other profession. And I think it's a 
slap in the face to the teachers and to the training

17:41.158 --> 17:48.865
institutions that prepared those people. 
They're going to be giving that test to people who

17:49.025 --> 17:54.410
have master's degrees from some of the best 
institutions in the state. In order to get into

17:54.430 --> 18:00.256
this institution, you have to have higher 
requirements than are going to be required on this

17:54.430 --> 18:00.256
test. Why do you have to spend $14 million to give 
210,000 teachers a test as a political

18:03.237 --> 18:11.608
activity. It's a total misuse of funds. And there 
are other methods for determining what they want

18:13.991 --> 18:20.680
to determine. But the emphasis on testing today 
suggests, and when they give the test, what are

18:20.980 --> 18:27.709
they going to have? It's not going to be a test of 
teacher

18:27.729 --> 18:32.856
confidence. I think it's a waste of time. Okay. Is 
this a one-time competency test that must be

18:37.863 --> 18:46.491
passed as a condition for further informant, or 
can it be retaken if failed? They're saying it can

18:47.071 --> 18:53.137
be retaken, but it's a one-time test. They won't 
give this every year because the people who will be

18:53.177 --> 19:02.505
coming in after this year to the profession will 
all have taken the pre-proficiency skills test to

19:03.363 --> 19:13.895
get into teacher education in the first place and 
the exit exam in the subject field. But those make

19:13.916 --> 19:25.269
sense because when you test a person on the 
pre-proficiency field, they're testing them on

19:13.916 --> 19:25.269
the first two years of college in terms of what 
they've studied in math and English. So it has a

19:25.289 --> 19:27.371
reference. The exit exam is on what they've been 
studying for four years in the subject field,

19:27.392 --> 19:32.037
which they're going to teach. and the 
professional education that they've been

19:32.624 --> 19:36.788
studying. The test is related to a curriculum, 
which is totally different than just pulling a

19:36.828 --> 19:54.066
test out of the air and giving it to teachers after 
20 years of teaching without reference to

19:36.828 --> 19:54.066
anything that they've recently studied. What is 
your opinion about the PPST exam? English

20:00.670 --> 20:07.137
proficiency exam before the state even 
recommended the pre-proficiency skills test.

20:07.437 --> 20:15.306
It's one set of evidence that we use in making the 
judgment of entrance. I feel grade point average

20:15.326 --> 20:22.734
is just as significant recommendations from the 
people who've been the teachers of the students.

20:22.754 --> 20:28.500
Observation of their work in the school and 
hearing that people a chance themselves early in

20:28.953 --> 20:41.991
their program to go out and work with teachers and 
students in the schools to see if they really want

20:28.953 --> 20:41.991
to be a teacher. Those are the kinds of things, in 
addition to the PPST that we do and that I think are

20:42.011 --> 20:51.924
essential in making judgments about at the point 
of matriculation before a person comes in to

20:42.011 --> 20:51.924
teacher education. In most cases, people who 
don't want to be teachers learn that through those

20:51.944 --> 20:58.453
first two years And most of them weed themselves 
out. They decide not

21:01.556 --> 21:06.360
to become teachers. It's a certain amount of 
self-serving. What is your opinion about the exit

21:08.562 --> 21:17.931
exam that students preparing to be educators must 
take upon graduation from college? My preference

21:18.752 --> 21:25.639
would be that the institutions design the test in 
relationship to the particular curriculum that

21:27.087 --> 21:31.554
the institution has developed to prepare the 
teachers. There's a great deal of similarity in

21:32.194 --> 21:42.570
some areas, but also an institution like ours, 
where we're moving toward five-year programs in

21:32.194 --> 21:42.570
some areas, and we're moving toward 
endorsements. In addition to being an elementary

21:43.411 --> 21:52.504
teacher or a secondary teacher, here at A&M, you 
can pick bilingual education, reading, special

21:43.411 --> 21:52.504
education. I would like to have them let us design 
our own tests, which they could then review to make

21:53.159 --> 22:00.990
sure they met their standards. And then they come 
in to review teams and give us program approval

22:03.013 --> 22:11.024
based on their evaluation of what we're doing. But 
I would leave it up to the institutions to design

22:11.044 --> 22:22.980
the test in relationship to the curriculum that 
they're teaching based on state standards.

22:23.652 --> 22:35.647
The professional standards allow the 
institution, the economy, to go beyond the

22:23.652 --> 22:35.647
minimums in developing our programs. And I would, 
in fact, hope the state would provide incentives

22:35.667 --> 22:51.988
for going beyond the minimums, rather than always 
being so concerned about whether we've met the

22:35.667 --> 22:51.988
minimum and then forgetting everything else. 
What is your opinion about students having to pass

22:52.745 --> 23:06.218
all academic courses with at least a grade of 70 in 
order to participate in extracurricular

22:52.745 --> 23:06.218
activities? I believe that to relate 
extracurricular activities to the rest of the

23:06.239 --> 23:22.735
curriculum and use it as a device, I believe the 
value of extracurricular activities can stand in

23:06.239 --> 23:22.735
their own without them being used to have a student 
hostage to do better than I was subject to. I think

23:30.381 --> 23:36.750
you can make a case for the educational value of 
so-called extracurricular activities. For

23:36.770 --> 23:48.587
instance, when a student gets the experience of 
being managing editor of a school newspaper, or is

23:36.770 --> 23:48.587
organizing the school play, or is participating 
in the debate team, In my estimation, the values

23:49.597 --> 24:05.197
that come from the learnings that come from those 
kind of activities are as valuable in many cases as

23:49.597 --> 24:05.197
students learning in the regular class. So I don't 
think you use one to force the other. I think there

24:09.402 --> 24:10.844
are other ways. The answer to improving people's 
performance in the academic classes is to make the

24:14.960 --> 24:32.377
curriculum as exciting as the extracurricular 
activities are, and not use the extracurricular

24:14.960 --> 24:32.377
activities

24:14.960 --> 24:32.377
as a threat. What's been missing in the dialogue 
are the three other areas of extracurricular

24:32.497 --> 24:43.127
activities that the committee was very concerned 
about, and I agree we ought to move on those. that

24:44.963 --> 24:53.751
there was an imbalance in the amount of money being 
spent for football and sports, not the other

24:44.963 --> 24:53.751
extracurricular activities. I think some of the 
other extracurricular activities get

24:53.771 --> 25:00.937
shortchanged because of the emphasis on 
interscholastic sports. I believe that

25:02.159 --> 25:13.789
interscholastic sports need to be de-emphasized 
and the other extracurricular activities

25:02.159 --> 25:13.789
emphasized more than they are, such as with the 
music programs and the art programs at school, the

25:14.545 --> 25:34.386
cultural programs that schools should have on 
valuable kinds of experiences that are lacking

25:14.545 --> 25:34.386
because of the imbalance in the way that money is 
spent. Secondly, the issue of the pull-outs that I

25:34.406 --> 25:43.776
strongly believe in what the committee 
recommended, that you ought to have the academic

25:44.245 --> 25:46.288
programs in the course of the day. And those ought 
to be saved for math, science, English, social

25:46.328 --> 25:51.816
science, and so forth. And you shouldn't be 
pulling students out to go to band or to debating.

25:56.182 --> 25:58.786
But you shouldn't eliminate debating or band. 
They should have those in another portion of the

25:58.826 --> 26:02.551
day. And that's a problem of scheduling. It isn't a 
problem of doing away with one or the other. And so I

26:08.832 --> 26:11.876
strongly believe in the committee's 
recommendation. And that was the committee's

26:11.896 --> 26:13.899
recommendation. It was not to do away with 
extroversion. Now the third area was the

26:18.486 --> 26:31.164
imbalance in the way sports, especially, was 
affecting the academic quality of the faculty.

26:31.184 --> 26:38.755
The whole idea of hiring people to be coaches and 
then asking the question, what can they teach, is

26:31.184 --> 26:38.755
the wrong sequence. That's an imbalance in terms 
of priorities. They should be asking, if there's

26:42.695 --> 26:58.089
an American history position open in the school, 
and you need American history, you ought to go out

26:42.695 --> 26:58.089
and find the best American history scholar who 
likes to work with students, young people, and can

26:42.695 --> 26:58.089
do that and make history exciting to them. You 
ought to hire that person, and then somebody ought

26:58.109 --> 27:04.615
to ask, can that person coach? And that's not being 
done enough. In fact, in some schools, They hire

27:09.683 --> 27:14.188
the head coach, and then he hires his assistants. 
And then somebody says, well, what can we get him?

27:15.930 --> 27:18.372
What can we have him teach? Well, that's totally 
wrong. That needs to be corrected. Now, those

27:23.178 --> 27:36.332
three areas of imbalance in the financing of 
athletics and the pull-out problem and the

27:23.178 --> 27:36.332
influence on the quality of the faculty haven't 
been discussed at all. It's all no pass, no play

27:38.167 --> 27:40.911
that's being discussed. Those other three areas, 
in my estimation, are just as critical as that

27:41.432 --> 27:51.668
issue, more critical than

27:41.432 --> 27:51.668
that issue. Why did Scope make no pass, no play part 
of House Bill 73? Primarily because of the looking

27:58.799 --> 28:04.969
for simple solutions to complex problems. The 
whole idea that threat can be a motivation to get

28:06.434 --> 28:22.535
people to do something well that they aren't doing 
well by taking away from them something that

28:06.434 --> 28:22.535
they're doing a good job at. And that, to me, is an 
example of a simple solution to a complex problem

28:22.555 --> 28:28.283
that doesn't work. For some kids, it will work for a 
short period of time to threaten them. But in the

28:33.990 --> 28:36.053
long run, it doesn't work. The only way you can get 
students to do well in the academic courses is by

28:36.539 --> 28:57.679
setting up a specific educational plan to help 
them, to set up tutorial programs to give them that

28:36.539 --> 28:57.679
extra help they need, and to make the classroom 
experience exciting for them. When you do that,

28:57.699 --> 29:03.525
the key to doing that is to having high quality 
teachers. Instead of trying to use these

29:04.012 --> 29:13.363
mechanical mechanisms to threaten people, you 
really need creative teachers. You need smaller

29:13.383 --> 29:16.806
classes, better curriculum materials. You need 
the opportunity, the flexibility of the teacher

29:17.627 --> 29:30.542
to help students work at the level they're at and 
have them feel good about themselves and use

29:17.627 --> 29:30.542
success at the next level of their stage of 
intellectual development. and challenge them

29:31.349 --> 29:37.217
there instead of giving them some task that they 
can't do and they feel like a failure. The key to

29:37.877 --> 29:44.366
teaching is being able to differentiate 
instruction based on where that student is at the

29:37.877 --> 29:44.366
moment. And not to give them an assignment that's 
so difficult it blows them over. The key is to give

29:48.711 --> 29:54.078
them an assignment that pushes them to their next 
level of understanding. And then they get into the

29:54.098 --> 29:59.365
next level above that by succeeding at that 
previous level. But that takes differentiation

30:00.256 --> 30:02.939
and individualization. And that takes schools 
where teachers have their time. You can't do that

30:07.224 --> 30:11.749
with 200 kids in English. Each student in English 
is at a different stage in their ability to write.

30:15.793 --> 30:19.057
And you have to be working with them at the stage 
they're at. Some kids can do college work while

30:19.237 --> 30:22.420
they're in the sixth grade. And they ought to be 
allowed to proceed as far as they can. Other kids

30:26.845 --> 30:28.407
may have mild handicaps where they read from right 
to left rather than left to right. They can't make

30:32.481 --> 30:34.884
sense out of letters. They have dyslexia or 
something, some other problem. So the teacher

30:38.668 --> 30:42.833
needs to use different approaches with those 
kids. But a good school helps each student move as

30:43.033 --> 30:53.785
far as they can in terms of what they're able to do 
and still get them to feel good about themselves,

30:43.033 --> 30:53.785
not feel like a failure for life. And that's what 
I'm worried about with these strict models where

30:59.588 --> 31:05.837
everybody has to fit into the mold, and if they 
don't, they don't make it. They're kicked out. And

31:07.620 --> 31:22.002
five years from now, we may end up with the test 
averages going up, but when we take a look at it, we

31:07.620 --> 31:22.002
may find that the 20% of the kids who needed our help 
most are no longer in school. There'll be more

31:22.022 --> 31:27.570
people passing the test, but the other kids will 
have dropped out. And if that happens, we

31:28.698 --> 31:31.080
shouldn't call it reform. And I don't think that's 
what the governor or the select committee or any

31:31.161 --> 31:38.789
other people had in mind. They did this with the 
best intentions. But it could happen if we don't

31:41.511 --> 31:47.538
take a close look at it. In regard to the appraisal 
teams, do you think the one evaluator who must be

31:47.558 --> 31:57.388
from where the teacher is employed should be an 
administrator? and why? No, I think they should

31:59.143 --> 32:06.353
separate the administrator from the process of 
doing the evaluation. I think they should do like

32:06.373 --> 32:17.709
they're doing in Tennessee, bringing in people 
from the outside, the outside evaluators, who are

32:06.373 --> 32:17.709
specialists in the teaching field and as the 
teachers teach. This principal goes in there and

32:17.729 --> 32:27.662
he's not trained in physics to do an evaluation of 
the physics teacher or chemistry or science or

32:28.537 --> 32:31.061
foreign language. You need people who are trained 
in the subject areas and also trained to use the

32:31.081 --> 32:39.353
performance appraisal instruments. And then you 
also want a situation where you separate the

32:40.955 --> 32:56.738
evaluation from the person who's going to have to 
make that decision and help that person over the

32:40.955 --> 32:56.738
rough spots. You really need, in a school, people 
doing evaluations for merit and salary increases

32:58.220 --> 33:09.097
and promotions separate from evaluation from 
instruction improvement. The people who are

33:09.117 --> 33:25.543
working with people on instruction improvement, 
if the principal's going to be an instruction

33:09.117 --> 33:25.543
leader, the teacher has to be able to go to that 
principal without any fear at all or threat and

33:09.117 --> 33:25.543
tell all the bad things about themselves, things 
they don't know what to do. As a beginning teacher,

33:26.384 --> 33:31.211
for instance, you want to go in and say to the 
principal, boy, I'm having trouble with this.

33:31.232 --> 33:38.302
It's very hard to say that if that same person is 
going to turn around and have to evaluate you for

33:31.232 --> 33:38.302
merit. So you need these two systems of evaluation 
operating, one for instructional improvement

33:38.763 --> 33:53.466
and another for making judgments relating to 
personnel practices, such as salary increases

33:38.763 --> 33:53.466
and promotions. And those have to be separated.

33:57.586 --> 33:59.328
Are you for or against? The same person can't do 
both. It's a conflict of roles.

34:05.476 --> 34:10.062
Are you for or against the appointed or elected 
state board of education? I would like to see an

34:10.082 --> 34:19.694
elected state board with much more involvement of 
the local community in that process.

34:20.775 --> 34:26.142
But I worry about putting all this power and a few 
people who are appointed, and the political

34:27.472 --> 34:36.501
patronage that goes with these appointments to 
these boards. Now, first time around, everybody

34:36.521 --> 34:47.511
agreed that this particular governor would bend 
over backwards to make sure there was no political

34:36.521 --> 34:47.511
basis for doing the appointment. But there was an 
appointed board in Texas at one time, and they did

34:47.711 --> 34:56.820
away with it during the Elmore Aiken study. And the 
reason they went away with it because it became a

34:57.509 --> 35:13.428
political patronage appointment process where, 
over time, the politicians used these

34:57.509 --> 35:13.428
appointments as a political activity. And I 
believe that the more you take these kinds of roles

35:13.448 --> 35:22.960
out of the local community, the less investment 
and sense of ownership the local area has in the

35:23.547 --> 35:30.917
whole business of education. And I think that 
electing their officials to make these decisions

35:30.937 --> 35:41.752
is one of many of the things we ought to put back with 
the local board. I believe we ought to have a

35:41.772 --> 35:53.267
bottom-up approach for educational change with 
the individual school as the focus for

35:41.772 --> 35:53.267
improvement, not a top-down approach where you 
get a few people who are chosen because someone

35:54.125 --> 36:06.936
says we can't have any faith in these local boards, 
they're all controlled by the booster squad, and

35:54.125 --> 36:06.936
they'll be putting too much emphasis on 
athletics. Well, the key to that is to emphasize

36:06.956 --> 36:18.586
that the local board has to take the 
responsibility for quality, not to say let's take

36:06.956 --> 36:18.586
over that role. Because ultimately, a school is 
only as good as that local community wants to make

36:23.251 --> 36:25.715
it. You can't mandate quality for 1,089 school 
districts, 240,000 teachers, and 3.2 million

36:25.855 --> 36:43.442
children from the state and treat every school 
district as if they were one district. And because

36:43.702 --> 36:51.334
the districts vary from one end of the state to the 
other in terms of size, in terms of makeup, You've

36:52.006 --> 36:53.587
got the urban areas. You've got the small West 
Texas towns. But the key that you want is a

36:57.291 --> 37:08.061
commitment, regardless of the size of that 
district, of the local people in their schools to

36:57.291 --> 37:08.061
take the responsibility to make it good. Not a few 
people in

37:08.081 --> 37:13.886
Austin. OK. If a student fails an academic course 
during the last six weeks of the academic school

37:14.687 --> 37:20.612
year, Will that student be barred from 
participating in extracurricular activities

37:21.082 --> 37:32.454
like football during the first six weeks of the 
following academic school year? I don't know how

37:32.474 --> 37:37.139
they rule it on that. We'll have to wait and see

37:37.159 --> 37:43.186
how that turns out. Do you feel that scope was 
adequately represented with educators? No, I

37:47.911 --> 37:48.532
don't. That was the only question. education on 
the committee. There were no teachers, there were

37:53.813 --> 38:01.085
no principals, there were no superintendents. 
The committee would have been a much different

38:01.946 --> 38:07.055
committee if it had teachers on it. There would 
have been a much more sensitivity and greater

38:07.075 --> 38:11.582
feeling as to what the life of a teacher is like. One 
of the issues that are raised by teachers when they

38:11.622 --> 38:16.350
try to differentiate programs based on the wide 
differentiation in where students are in terms of

38:16.972 --> 38:41.668
what they're trying to teach, in terms of reading 
groups, levels of reading in any given class, the

38:16.972 --> 38:41.668
diversity that you find within any given class, 
and how you have to go about designing specific

38:16.972 --> 38:41.668
teaching strategies to meet the needs of those 
different learners. The committee really tried

38:44.444 --> 38:49.891
to get a sense of the pieces by listening to a lot of 
them coming into the meeting. And also, in the

38:49.911 --> 38:58.803
testimony, all the professional groups had a 
chance to come before the committee. And Perot,

38:59.043 --> 39:08.275
Mr. Perot, really did a good job, I think, in hiring 
Sorolla to get this information on this survey.

39:08.695 --> 39:13.742
But we did not have this constant input and 
confrontation in the subcommittee. that was very

39:14.397 --> 39:20.863
essential, would be very essential to have with 
teachers in an ongoing way. And I think the

39:20.883 --> 39:32.973
credibility of the committee would have been 
strengthened by having people fund education,

39:20.883 --> 39:32.973
more people for education on the committee

39:20.883 --> 39:32.973
itself. Do you think House Bill 72 made the 
teaching profession a rewarding one to attract

39:32.993 --> 39:41.801
good teachers and retain good teachers? Some 
aspects of it can do that if they're properly

39:45.464 --> 39:48.128
implemented. The highest salary was essential. 
The scholar loan programs that were developed and

39:51.292 --> 39:57.019
that have been implemented, but there's not 
enough money there. Really, we're talking about a

39:57.760 --> 40:02.847
million dollars for pre-service students. I 
forgot the exact amount of money for career

40:02.867 --> 40:12.720
teachers who want to shift from the teaching field 
they're in now to the high priority area, the

40:02.867 --> 40:12.720
shortage area. But they didn't fund some aspects 
of the research and development to try to provide

40:13.763 --> 40:30.409
funds where industry and the schools and colleges 
could come together to develop model programs,

40:13.763 --> 40:30.409
innovative programs that would go beyond the 
minimum standard. We need to do a lot more with

40:30.429 --> 40:38.742
providing tutors to back up the teachers when they 
make recommendations that students need

40:30.429 --> 40:38.742
tutoring. For the first time in the history, 
there's a lunch program now where the teacher's

40:39.498 --> 40:52.811
supposed to have free lunch duty of at least a half 
hour, but in some school districts, they're not

40:39.498 --> 40:52.811
giving them this. They still have to eat with the 
kids. The conditions in the workplace, the

40:56.014 --> 41:09.066
smaller classes would have made a great deal of 
difference, but those are the first things that

40:56.014 --> 41:09.066
the districts are asking for waivers on because 
they say they don't have the teachers or the space

40:56.014 --> 41:09.066
to provide the smaller classes. A lot's going to 
happen, and a lot's going to depend on what

41:09.518 --> 41:15.607
happens, for instance, with things like the 
career ladder, too. That could be a terrific

41:15.627 --> 41:33.133
program if we can get in shape what the career level 
three and four requirements are going to be in

41:15.627 --> 41:33.133
terms of role definitions and increased 
incentives for becoming a trainer of beginning

41:15.627 --> 41:33.133
teachers and things like this. But all that has yet 
to be worked out. See, the salary is only one thing

41:36.822 --> 41:40.627
that creates a profession. It's basically the 
knowledge base, what kind of training they have,

41:40.827 --> 41:47.857
and we need to do a lot more about that. Teachers 
have to have a lot more autonomy in terms of the

41:47.877 --> 41:51.823
governance structure. We have to rely on teachers 
themselves to set the standards and monitor them.

41:56.369 --> 42:03.859
Actually, this bill took away from the Commission 
on Professional Standards much of its authority

41:56.369 --> 42:03.859
because the school state board itself now can give 
approval for local districts to set up

42:04.362 --> 42:13.151
alternative certification programs and bypass 
the commission of professional standards

42:04.362 --> 42:13.151
completely. So that was a step backward for the 
profession. The conditions in the workplace may

42:18.837 --> 42:25.263
be more important in many respects than the 
salary. If these essential elements

42:25.283 --> 42:32.310
requirements, which are requiring much more 
paperwork, The more the paper shuffling gets

42:33.303 --> 42:42.817
foisted on the teachers, we're going to drive a lot 
of them out of teaching. If you hand a teacher a

42:42.837 --> 43:02.365
syllabus and say, make sure everybody in this 
class is on page such and such on October 13th, and

42:42.837 --> 43:02.365
we're going to judge how good you are by giving them 
all a test, it changes the whole nature of teaching

42:42.837 --> 43:02.365
from a very creative process in which that teacher 
who loves their subject teaches it in the most

42:42.837 --> 43:02.365
creative ways possible. and then gets the 
students turned on instead of trying to do this

43:03.172 --> 43:10.460
workbook thing with these essential elements and 
then fill out the form. And a lot's going to happen

43:11.601 --> 43:31.002
in terms of the way the state loosens up and gets 
back to providing some of these teachers to trust

43:11.601 --> 43:31.002
them and have faith in them and give them some 
autonomy to teach these basic skills programs and

43:11.601 --> 43:31.002
beyond in creative ways. They'll take good 
leadership. I would like to see the state move

43:35.350 --> 43:53.577
toward a system where the better a school became, 
the more autonomy it would have, and reward them

43:35.350 --> 43:53.577
for being good by letting them develop innovative 
ways to do things, and not treat every school as if

43:35.350 --> 43:53.577
it was the same. Those schools which aren't doing a 
good job should be declared bankrupt, and the

43:53.597 --> 44:01.528
state should go in and do everything they can We're 
those, but not to put all of these minimum

44:01.762 --> 44:09.133
regulations on all of these really good school 
districts. Those good school districts ought to

44:09.153 --> 44:12.738
be rewarded by saying, do better. Think of 
creative things on your own that you can do to go

44:12.858 --> 44:22.292
beyond where you are, and the state then ought to 
provide incentives to help you do that.

44:22.312 --> 44:25.317
That's what will keep good teachers in teaching. 
If they have a chance to be creative and innovative

44:25.337 --> 44:29.423
and then get rewarded But the hard work it's going 
to take to go beyond the minimums.

44:37.224 --> 44:40.767
OK. What are the bad parts of Haskell 72? Well, I 
think the overemphasis on testing as an indicator

44:40.787 --> 44:47.013
of excellence. There are many more ways to define 
excellence than just test scores. You know, I

44:53.859 --> 44:57.823
think that the...

44:59.035 --> 45:13.411
aspects of the bill with the over-emphasis on 
threat as the primary means for motivation, the

44:59.035 --> 45:13.411
whole business of the no more than five days 
absent. Here, kids, you see, those kinds of

45:13.431 --> 45:25.524
things, the regulations, when you try to 
implement those, having been a principal of a

45:13.431 --> 45:25.524
school and a teacher, I know that you need the 
flexibility in a school. The assumption is if you

45:26.165 --> 45:28.367
don't have those rules, kids will you know, not, 
they'll abuse them. Well, there are other ways to

45:35.025 --> 45:39.352
get kids to go to school other than having those 
rules. You may have a situation, for instance,

45:39.372 --> 45:49.587
where you have a migrant farm worker student who, 
in order to keep the family going, has to work

45:39.372 --> 45:49.587
during certain times of the year. We used to be the 
kids where any day you could get that child in

45:50.088 --> 45:55.536
school, you were happy to get them there. You 
wanted to get them there. And now that kid misses

45:57.592 --> 46:15.697
five days of school, and he might as well stay out of 
school for the whole semester, because even if he

45:57.592 --> 46:15.697
comes back, which he's not going to when you sit 
there and not get any credit for it, he misses the

45:57.592 --> 46:15.697
five days, he loses the whole semester, which is 
absurd. What you want to do is set up a system where

46:15.777 --> 46:22.366
you get him in school as many days as you possibly 
can working. That's going to be a system where

46:22.386 --> 46:26.552
after five days, after they miss five days, 
they'll give up. It's just like having this six

46:27.089 --> 46:35.437
weeks as a suspension time for people who don't get 
past these minimum grades. This doesn't make any

46:35.457 --> 46:36.678
sense. Why six weeks? Why can't you make it on a 
system of week by week? And working with a student

46:42.163 --> 46:47.829
to progress and helping them succeed. Not use it as 
punishment. Use it as a means of motivation and

46:50.091 --> 46:55.476
incentive But somebody's got to work with the 
student. It doesn't do any good to just say you

47:00.141 --> 47:04.386
can't participate for six weeks. Somebody ought 
to be working with that student before they get to

47:05.327 --> 47:11.615
the situation where they don't pass. And then if 
they don't pass, somebody ought to be working with

47:12.195 --> 47:15.119
them right off. And there ought to be some 
incentives, some goal set. And then if the student

47:19.885 --> 47:24.450
meets those goals, then you Move ahead and help you 
feel like a success if you don't do things in terms

47:25.443 --> 47:31.672
of six-week chunks. People who are 15 and 16 don't 
live their lives that way. They don't think of

47:36.438 --> 47:37.980
those things. We're going to lose a lot of kids from 
school. The thing I'm hoping that somebody does is

47:41.986 --> 47:50.758
hold each of these school districts to the 
requirement in the legislation that they do.
