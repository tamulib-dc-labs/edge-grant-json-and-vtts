WEBVTT

00:02.883 --> 00:14.154
Your full name, please, sir, and a little about 
your personal background, your early years, and

00:02.883 --> 00:14.154
how you came to be associated with Mitchell 
Energy. Okay, it's Bernard F. Clark, although

00:14.174 --> 00:24.944
I've gone by the nickname Bud, with two Ds, for some 
reason, ever since high school. I was born and grew

00:24.964 --> 00:31.270
up in New York City, and went to Fordham 
Preparatory School, because I had a scholarship

00:32.482 --> 00:50.644
for it, and then to Fordham University, where I 
studied chemistry, and so I was able to get a loan

00:32.482 --> 00:50.644
and a grant and work at the school. I joined the ROTC 
at the time, this is 1938 to 1942,

00:50.664 --> 00:59.755
mainly to get the monthly check in the junior year 
bonanza to help pay for the schooling. Like some

01:07.537 --> 01:13.863
people in the Persian Gulf are finding out now, if 
you take the money, you go. In my case, it paid. So

01:17.707 --> 01:28.898
since I had chemistry, I was switched into the 
chemical warfare service from Coast Artillery,

01:17.707 --> 01:28.898
which was the ROTC group at Edgewater. And then 
when I got down to Aberdeen, which is the Army

01:30.177 --> 01:39.489
chemical depot, they needed three or four people 
in the Air Corps. So fortunately, I got switched to

01:40.350 --> 01:51.245
that, which I then headed south at MacDill Field 
and spent an amazing majority of my time at

01:40.350 --> 01:51.245
Hartsdale. And the last part at Edmund Field was 
testing

01:51.265 --> 01:57.433
weapons, chemical weapons. You were at Barksdale 
during the war? From 52 to 42 to 44. Is that right?

02:02.879 --> 02:04.982
Yeah. The strange thing is, Ken Patterson, who was 
in charge of the gas sales, was the commanding

02:05.002 --> 02:12.210
officer of Barksdale. And he retired now working 
for us. But you said some odd grouping gets into

02:14.373 --> 02:17.337
place. Yeah, it really does. So anyhow, I went back 
up to New York to get a job and called on GE,

02:28.480 --> 02:43.076
Selenese, and Pan American Petroleum and 
Transport, which is now called Amacom, or Wesley,

02:28.480 --> 02:43.076
one part of Amacom. So at 42nd Street, I got a job in 
Texas City, Texas. That's where the lab was. And I

02:50.163 --> 02:55.970
came down and saw that there was no way I could get 
anywhere without a PhD. Things had changed too

02:56.170 --> 02:58.032
much during the war. So I heard about the Harvard 
Business School from my wife and applied and was

02:58.872 --> 03:05.680
accepted. And then we went up there from 47 to 49. 
You missed the big explosion down in Texas City?

03:10.345 --> 03:10.405
No. You were there? We were there. My wife was 
working at Carbide, and I was at Pan Am. And the

03:14.650 --> 03:17.874
explosion was down at the Harvard, which was about 
three miles away. Shocking glass where she was.

03:22.178 --> 03:24.401
She was over at the next plant down. But at the 
refinery. Well, the main thing there was a good

03:27.526 --> 03:33.693
big, I guess, 40-foot section of pipe that looked 
like a javelin throwhead. So I had to stick it in

03:33.713 --> 03:36.076
there. And that one missed the main crew line by, 
say, six feet. I don't know. People were

03:40.581 --> 03:44.105
exaggerating at the time like that. So that was in 
1947. And we went to Harvard in September. Were you

03:50.312 --> 03:53.115
sort of thinking career change or direction? 
Well, actually, I wrote this up. And I wrote to some

03:57.547 --> 04:08.178
of the men and had articles about them and asked 
them whether a combination of a business degree

03:57.547 --> 04:08.178
with a technical degree was a good idea. And they 
looked like, yes. So it was more of that. Because

04:11.942 --> 04:14.125
that was rather rare at that time, wasn't it? Well, 
also, I saw petrochemicals being a hell of a big

04:14.145 --> 04:17.428
deal. I read everything I could on there. So when I 
came out of Harvard, actually, I increased my

04:18.930 --> 04:26.558
salary $15 a month by getting an MBA. I went to J.T. 
Baker Chemical Company, which is in the city area

04:28.949 --> 04:35.096
of Dick Chemical, because I wanted to get the 
chemical side. I had the petroleum side of New

04:35.116 --> 04:37.940
Orleans. Then I watched from New Orleans. So when 
Amoco started up with Standard of Indiana, of

04:39.462 --> 04:50.195
course, started up another sub down in New 
Orleans, we came down here. And then when they

04:50.276 --> 04:54.621
decided to do away with it five years later, I sent a 
resume to Boston to the school, and one over here to

04:55.630 --> 05:00.617
Houston to one of the alumni. And as a result, I got 
Conoco to come over, and George's partner,

05:01.939 --> 05:09.930
Marilyn Christian, had to come over. And I had a 
meeting with him, which was not the, what one might

05:09.950 --> 05:19.444
say, the normal interview. The gist of it was that, 
I'm telling my wife, I was a bit crazy. She said,

05:23.245 --> 05:24.126
well, you'll fit. Actually, it was the first. What 
year was this? 1956. I'll flip that over any time

05:32.414 --> 05:35.517
you want me to. Well, flip it over.

05:40.041 --> 05:41.643
OK, wait a moment. I said, OK, so we came here. What 
year was that again? 1956. In 1956. Yeah, so I went

05:46.868 --> 05:49.330
from general manager to vice president, to 
executive vice president, to vice chairman, and I

05:49.934 --> 05:57.990
guess to ex-vice chairman at some point. Now, when 
you came in 56, could you sort of describe the

05:58.270 --> 06:09.853
status of Mitchell, Henry, or CMM, and what was 
going on, where you were doing your primary work? I

06:10.654 --> 06:12.077
would say there might be something. The 
controversy with George, he is my version of it,

06:13.542 --> 06:21.549
because his version is always different. But 
there's about 225 employees, 225 to 250. And there

06:25.893 --> 06:30.598
was no order, no organization.

06:33.661 --> 06:41.608
Even to this day, there is a certain, if you look at 
the table of organization, or create one, I had

06:41.875 --> 06:45.500
some consultants sit over 12 years ago. And I said, 
George, here's your table organization. And they

06:48.425 --> 06:50.608
drew five circles and put George in the middle. And 
I said, everybody reports you. So it was pretty

06:54.353 --> 06:58.820
much that way, except the circles got twisted up. 
So I imagine that was one of the purposes of me over

06:59.821 --> 07:05.450
here as a non-accountant. And I don't need a 
chemist, although I would understand technical

07:05.470 --> 07:10.397
matters. It was more or less administration. 
George at that time was handling the finance,

07:13.811 --> 07:19.500
because mainly it was natural gas pipeline was 
advancing money to keep you on the well. And he did

07:19.961 --> 07:26.411
banking with Dr. Vance, who was over in Bank 
Southwest. And the, but as time went on, I took over

07:26.431 --> 07:31.238
the bank in about 59. So you already came into the 
business sector. You really weren't doing much in

07:34.203 --> 07:36.486
terms of... Oh, no. There's been one thing, any 
time I get an operations course and they're like,

07:36.652 --> 07:45.764
so one time he'll tell me, you know, stay out. He'll 
say, have an operations course. And I can roam the

07:48.868 --> 07:50.850
rest of it. Cross over, get in the foot. I 
appreciate it. So that's pretty much the way it's

07:58.620 --> 08:01.984
been. Up until 76 and then... We set up a 
refinancing and turned it over to Tony and turned

08:04.529 --> 08:08.913
it over to Smith. And it's pretty much on a routine. 
Well, they won't say it. They won't appreciate it.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.521
I thought it was . So it's not routine. Smith keeps 
coming up with new games. But compared to the way we

08:23.926 --> 08:28.710
had to beg, borrow, and steal money in the old days, 
it's routine. It's a different world. Most of the

08:32.914 --> 08:33.895
activity Yeah. Wise County,

08:35.907 --> 08:43.695
Palacios, Vienna. Now, when did real estate begin 
to iterate into the picture? Well, on the side,

08:46.899 --> 09:01.114
Johnny Mitchell had made friends with Norman 
Dobbins, who actually and his wife were interior

08:46.899 --> 09:01.114
decorators, and Norman had a flair for design, so 
he talked He had started the home building

09:02.123 --> 09:04.987
company. Johnny was coming into it. So Merlin and 
George, they took half, and Norman had half. So we

09:10.795 --> 09:12.437
were sort of in the home building business. And a 
leftover of that is Imperial Valley, or the

09:12.537 --> 09:22.752
Esplanade, was the commercial that was left after 
the subdivision was built there. So that's

09:22.772 --> 09:25.696
really, you might say, the start. Then about, I 
think, 62, and this you'd have to check with

09:25.716 --> 09:30.983
George, bought the land down at Pirates Beach. And 
that was really the first development time? Yeah.

09:40.211 --> 09:41.152
The real development? Yeah. What precipitated 
that? Because in 1962, Galveston was not exactly

09:42.614 --> 09:48.079
what you call a booming. George saw the golden city 
on the hill and had been building that golden city .

09:57.509 --> 09:57.949
That's why. The way it was in the 1890s. That's an 
old story. It's still there. It's still part of the

10:08.389 --> 10:10.492
80s. Part. It's it. How do you build a building like 
that in San Luis? Book of Return coming out.

10:22.333 --> 10:24.156
Obviously I had to do it. the real estate business, 
let's say, was in any way competitive with the oil

10:24.828 --> 10:29.994
business, or that it was diverting energies or 
anything? Not at that time. Then he bought the

10:33.297 --> 10:38.463
Grogan Dockers, which I believe was 1964. And the 
two of us went around financing it, which we had no

10:39.564 --> 10:44.969
luck. But he financed it with an outfit here in 
town, which just proved at much better rates and

10:44.990 --> 10:52.017
terms He just proved what his damn persistence was 
good for. Yeah. And the next thing was he bought

10:57.172 --> 10:59.716
Pelican Island. His brother knew that the DeVoe 
Company, I think it was DeVoe, owned it and had a big

10:59.816 --> 11:07.087
tax gain. The Georgians said, look, they put that 
$7 million in there, but they had that bridge. And

11:13.558 --> 11:17.724
he said, well, look, why don't you take, now's the 
time to take your tax loss again. So he talked them

11:17.764 --> 11:19.607
into it. So now Pelican sort of came out. The 
woodlands have come out. I mean, the timberlands

11:24.735 --> 11:26.638
have come out. They've been paid $125, of which 
only $40 was land. The rest was timber. And they

11:33.027 --> 11:37.653
have paid for themselves over and over, sort of 
like goddamn Toll Bridge. And Pelican paid for

11:38.774 --> 11:41.378
itself. But they're loaded with debt that came 
from elsewhere. The overhead at Woodlands was

11:45.003 --> 11:46.585
beginning. The losses, et cetera. It all got 
dumped over here, and now you can't find it, trace

11:48.578 --> 11:54.045
it. Now, once, at the point where I saw he could get 
it to be, it was really 1967, was the first evening I

11:54.065 --> 12:04.757
had that he was out to build the city. Now, I'll tell 
you one thing about the Timberlands, the 50,000

12:04.777 --> 12:07.881
acres. He put those together all by himself, an 
attorney from Vincent Elkins, and a forester who

12:07.901 --> 12:16.512
was working on the road. Got it. The company was not 
involved in any which way. It was all 273 damn

12:19.918 --> 12:23.963
transactions he talks about. I'm scared. Yeah. So 
once that started, I said, OK. And then I had to go

12:29.450 --> 12:35.137
around to other places. Well, I'd just seen Zach 
and Dolphin got broke. And George says, well, you

12:38.281 --> 12:42.306
don't lose money and land just on developing it. 
Yes. Who developed it?

12:46.645 --> 12:47.846
So it was a constant. Now, Woodland, the only 
positive or even negative thing I had to deal with

12:47.866 --> 12:56.997
was the 50,000 bonds. I personally handled the 
sale of dealing with underwriters by public debt

12:57.277 --> 13:05.847
and doing it by phone. I did that, but once you get 
past that. Oh, now, back on the recreational, I

13:14.101 --> 13:18.728
worked up with the marketing people, and I had to 
see if you could get it going better. In the women's

13:18.748 --> 13:19.830
marketing? No, no, no, no. It had to be Galveston, 
and Livingston, and up here. I brought in some

13:25.057 --> 13:29.444
people from California, and worked with them. 
Those are my two connections with it. Interview

13:35.152 --> 13:35.853
over. Interview over. Well, let's talk about it.
