00:01.702 --> 00:06.431
Today's date is July 1, 1981. This is a test. This is 
Terry Anderson.

00:17.614 --> 00:17.854
There we go. This is an interview with Major 
General William Becker. Today is 1st July, 1981.

00:25.141 --> 00:26.642
This is Terry Anderson. Let's start with your 
parents. Could you tell me about your parents,

00:29.525 --> 00:32.888
your mother and father? Yes. My father, whose name 
was George Becker,

00:35.151 --> 00:44.500
was born here on this land where we live now. In the 
old house over here? No, he moved to the old home

00:46.950 --> 00:50.053
here when he was two. It was built when he was two 
years old. His grandfather had come here from

00:53.757 --> 01:04.628
Germany, and the family history is that William 
Ernest Becker had fled Germany. He was a political

01:06.870 --> 01:09.333
refugee of some sort. When? Back in 1834. I believe 
it was 1834.

01:20.697 --> 01:22.619
He had a rather responsible position. And it was 
obviously a political position. He was in charge

01:28.245 --> 01:40.157
of the,

01:28.245 --> 01:40.157
what was his name, William, the emperor's? 
Wilhelm. Wilhelm. Frederick Wilhelms. Game

01:44.723 --> 01:47.827
preserves throughout Germany. And I say that had 
to be a political appointment, because he majored

01:49.470 --> 01:54.697
in music at the University of Berlin. No kidding. 
But anyway, he came over here and brought his

01:58.022 --> 02:00.325
family. We still have at home there some of the 
items of furniture they brought, which wasn't

02:00.786 --> 02:05.052
much. I still have the old gun. By the way, I meant to 
show you that that he brought over from Germany,

02:06.274 --> 02:14.005
because you mentioned you're interested in guns. 
And he stopped first in Pennsylvania and moved on

02:14.322 --> 02:26.856
west after a few years to Illinois and looked for 
greener pastures down here and came here in 1848.

02:26.956 --> 02:30.240
Bought some land here and then expanded upon it.

02:34.104 --> 02:43.114
And then, of course, his children stayed in the 
area and married in the area. I say that I'm kin to

02:44.258 --> 02:57.336
any family that's within horseback riding 
distance from here, I'm kin to if they've been here

02:44.258 --> 02:57.336
over 60 years, because that was about the courting 
distance, you know, in those days.

03:02.604 --> 03:13.759
My grandfather

03:02.604 --> 03:13.759
became sort of the one that stayed in the center of 
the land, so to speak, and then my father

03:02.604 --> 03:13.759
succeeding him. And my father tried to retain or 
reacquire as much of the family land as he could. He

03:23.450 --> 03:27.815
did a pretty good job of it, I think, considering 
the years of the Depression and all that sort of

03:23.450 --> 03:27.815
thing. My grandfather, of course, married a 
neighbor girl. My father married my mother, who

03:35.804 --> 03:43.813
was the daughter of the Methodist minister in 
Kauffman. who had earlier been ministering Kemp.

03:49.084 --> 03:58.834
And after their ministry in Kauffman, Mother had 
completed college and had returned to Kauffman as

03:49.084 --> 03:58.834
a schoolteacher. Oh, really? Where'd she go to 
college? She went to Kidd Key College, which no

04:00.737 --> 04:04.621
longer exists. It was over at Greenville. Kidd 
Key? How do you go there? K-I-d-d-d-k-e-y. Oh,

04:12.489 --> 04:13.210
I've never even heard of that. But it's been off the 
map for some time. And of course, that's where Dad

04:17.361 --> 04:18.883
met her. Was he over there going to college, too? 
No. He met her in Coppin when she came to teach

04:23.629 --> 04:25.692
school. And

04:26.633 --> 04:32.882
they married, and he brought her to the country. So 
she had an education degree then. Yes, she had a

04:36.123 --> 04:38.326
teacher's certificate. Actually, I believe in 
those days the only requirement, I think Kidd Key,

04:38.346 --> 04:46.338
as a matter of fact, I'm not certain of this, was a 
two-year school. And I think that was the

04:46.358 --> 04:50.764
requirement in those days to be certificated, 
certified. And she taught just a few years before

04:52.086 --> 04:55.270
Dad brought her out here. And they had six 
children, five boys and a girl, the girl being next

04:56.792 --> 05:04.223
to the youngest. George, the old George Jr., the 
oldest, has been here all through the years. My dad

05:09.720 --> 05:12.023
died by accident in 1948.

05:17.532 --> 05:18.814
And mother died in 1975. George has been here 
through the years. He's been in the cattle

05:21.459 --> 05:28.009
business and real estate business. And he's had a 
very interesting life.

05:33.565 --> 05:35.868
been in a very interesting aspect of real estate. 
He has been the land man, so to speak, for the

05:37.269 --> 05:48.402
acquisition of land for a number of the lakes that 
have been built by the Sabine River Authority.

05:48.462 --> 05:57.873
Like, for example, this, what do they call it, the 
new lake over near Quitman that Dallas is about to

05:48.462 --> 05:57.873
acquire. Oh, yeah. And what he's done is go in and 
make an estimate of what it's going to cost to

06:00.177 --> 06:05.205
acquire the land. In that case, I think it was 
40,000 acres. And then he sets about acquiring it.

06:11.875 --> 06:16.282
And it's a very complex and interesting 
operation, but we won't get too far off on that. But

06:16.543 --> 06:17.925
anyway, Georgia stayed here. Walter, the next 
brother, became a general surgeon, spent most of

06:18.205 --> 06:27.079
his professional life at New Orleans. He was a 
graduate of TCU and then Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt

06:31.421 --> 06:32.702
Medical School. George, by the way, graduated 
from Texas A&M in 37.

06:39.712 --> 06:42.877
And Brother Walter died in February this year. 
Then I was the next one. Of course, I went to A&M. And

06:47.483 --> 06:50.588
then Brother Young and I had a Navy career. He 
retired, I guess, three years ago as a rear admiral

06:50.668 --> 06:57.117
in the Navy. And he died last fall. The sister, the 
only sister, interestingly enough, married our

07:00.311 --> 07:08.598
Methodist minister.

07:11.561 --> 07:17.946
And I might add that all these boys gave him some 
trouble during those serious courtship months.

07:19.408 --> 07:22.630
We thought we didn't want a preacher for a 
brother-in-law, I guess. And that our

07:23.111 --> 07:26.614
grandfather had been close to the fire, you know. 
What about the youngest? In those years, the

07:33.090 --> 07:41.739
Methodist minister was a student at SMU for years 
to keep our little church going in Kent and here. So

07:43.120 --> 07:47.805
he was a graduating student when they met, but he's 
a very fine man. What about the youngest? The

07:49.167 --> 07:51.189
youngest is an architect, lives in Dallas. He 
graduated from Yale and did his initial

07:55.433 --> 08:00.798
professional practice in New Haven and came to 
Dallas later. So that's the family to me. And would

08:05.143 --> 08:07.705
you like our lineup within the family? Well, I'd 
like to know about your father's education. Your

08:11.229 --> 08:16.694
great-grandfather was one of the few people in 
Germany that went to university. Very few people

08:16.774 --> 08:20.117
in the 1800s went to university. And then you did, 
of course, too, in America. your father and your

08:25.876 --> 08:30.123
grandfather also go to a university? No, no. My 
grandfather did not, nor did my father. Of course,

08:34.631 --> 08:37.416
my grandfather stayed on the land here, and so did 
Dad. Dad was, uh, left school in the, he finished

08:37.616 --> 08:50.398
the tenth grade, and he lost his father, and, uh, 
when he was young, and he had the responsibility

08:37.616 --> 08:50.398
for his mother, and his baby sister. So he didn't 
even finish high school. But I consider him a very

08:56.900 --> 08:58.962
well-educated man. Well, what kind of man was your 
father? Can you tell me? Can you describe him?

09:04.507 --> 09:10.072
Well, in appearance, he was tall and very active. 
And matter of fact, he was 69 years old when he was

09:10.192 --> 09:14.056
accidentally killed. And he could still work me 
down when I'd come home and help him do whatever. I

09:20.534 --> 09:23.418
think he was very well read. He was a leader in the 
community and the area. As a matter of fact,

09:28.484 --> 09:47.588
I think that during the Depression, he was the 
director of the Federal Land Bank of this

09:28.484 --> 09:47.588
district, and he was, I think, a charter director 
of the production credit associations when they

09:48.918 --> 09:53.865
were created, the local one or the area one. I think 
it was headquartered in McKinney. But I mention

09:56.749 --> 10:05.962
this because the Depression took a heavy toll of 
land in terms of foreclosures. I think he really At

10:10.822 --> 10:23.633
least I met some members of the Federal Land Bank 
staff that told me he'd been very instrumental in

10:10.822 --> 10:23.633
the policy making that saved a lot of those people, 
but also saved the loans. Well, he should have been

10:24.119 --> 10:30.288
capable in that regard, having been pretty 
substantial landowner and operator himself. So

10:31.089 --> 10:37.017
you say that he was a leader, and was he like a mayor, 
or can you define that? Well, of course, he always

10:37.038 --> 10:41.744
lived in the country, and he was involved very 
heavily in community affairs. We never had a

10:41.784 --> 10:48.354
formal community organization other than school 
board, of course, and he was seen to be forever on

10:41.784 --> 10:48.354
the school board. But he was very... active, as I 
mentioned, in the farm organizations of all kinds

10:52.570 --> 11:01.421
and in this financing field. Was he active in the 
church? He was active in the church, and Mother, of

11:03.464 --> 11:08.550
course, was very active in the church. But he spent 
a lot of time around this county and this area just

11:08.570 --> 11:18.723
doing things for the public good, and so people 
respected him for it. He never ran for elective

11:19.424 --> 11:21.987
office, I guess, other than... school board. 
Mother, of course, was a homemaker and a great

11:25.273 --> 11:34.786
mother and a great supporter of Dad and that 
partnership. Would you consider that religion

11:35.067 --> 11:39.272
then was important in your upbringing? I think it 
was very important. I've never been a very

11:40.935 --> 11:53.492
demonstrative person in terms of religion, but of 
course, Mother being the daughter of a Methodist

11:40.935 --> 11:53.492
minister, we had certainly the benefit of good 
training. And when I've needed it, it's been very

11:54.232 --> 11:57.795
important to me. And, you know, you do need it from 
time to time. When you feel you need it, you need to

12:00.818 --> 12:06.763
call on the strengths that religion gives. Now, in 
your home when you were growing up, who was the

12:07.704 --> 12:14.010
authority? Well, there's no question. Dad was the 
supreme authority, but it was sort of... Supreme

12:15.011 --> 12:19.535
commander. Yeah. But Mother tried to handle 
all... old thing because she was always there but

12:23.695 --> 12:33.931
if she couldn't she'd she'd refer it to the higher 
authority and so we had pretty good discipline in

12:23.695 --> 12:33.931
this family of ours. He was a disciplinarian would 
you say? I would say so very strict one. He was

12:38.058 --> 12:38.599
strict? Yeah.

12:42.164 --> 12:44.488
How'd you get along with your brothers and your one 
sister? Oh we got along fine I think we had uh we had

12:45.550 --> 12:51.559
the usual squabbles with the next older and the 
next younger. I was between boys. The sister got

13:00.409 --> 13:05.414
along famously, but it was a little bit difficult 
for her to grow up with five boys. I would imagine.

13:07.216 --> 13:08.597
But she was none the worse for it. We, I think, grew 
to have a great deal of respect for each other, too.

13:17.626 --> 13:18.927
You know, that's important. I want to check this.

13:23.838 --> 13:32.390
Okay, now you've become a leader and a success 
making general officer in the United States Army.

13:32.911 --> 13:39.360
In which ways do you think that your parents are 
responsible for that? Well, I think, of course,

13:39.380 --> 13:49.074
first of all, I knew what disciplined behavior was 
because I learned it from them firsthand. And I

13:50.436 --> 13:51.297
think... They also

13:53.673 --> 14:03.303
taught us the importance of the objective in life, 
or next week, or whatever. And of course, as a

14:03.383 --> 14:11.412
matter of fact, the objective is one of the most 
important principles of war, having a goal,

14:03.383 --> 14:11.412
having an objective. It's kind of hard to 
accomplish anything significant without it. And

14:18.519 --> 14:22.363
that, I think, was a very important thing. 
Leadership, I think, knowledge is a very, very

14:23.018 --> 14:32.190
important ingredient or element of leadership. 
They insisted it would be good students and good

14:33.852 --> 14:36.836
learners. And of course, when you have that 
situation, you learn something about what your

14:37.057 --> 14:46.009
capacities are. I think a person who's never 
tested doesn't know what his capacities are. Were

14:51.035 --> 14:52.958
you tested at home then a lot? No, I mean, I use that 
term tested in terms of practical testing,

14:53.512 --> 15:01.264
testing by the situation. Well, that's what I 
know. Yeah. So they insisted that we apply

15:04.689 --> 15:15.545
ourselves and we devote good effort to whatever we 
were doing. And as my old daddy used to say,

15:15.565 --> 15:21.814
anything worth doing is worth doing right. So they 
gave us a good foundation, a very good basis. I

15:27.677 --> 15:34.106
never felt that

15:27.677 --> 15:34.106
destiny was calling me. I just always tried to do a 
good job and try to set some goals and apply myself.

15:40.634 --> 15:42.056
Tell me about your education. Well, of course, I 
went to this country school here through the

15:43.258 --> 15:48.865
eighth grade, and then I to Kauffman High School, 
graduated there in our Texas centennial year in

15:49.452 --> 15:54.300
1936. I

15:54.420 --> 16:06.498
had two brothers in college at the time, George and 
A&M and Pete and Walter in TCU. And so I had to wait a

16:06.619 --> 16:12.448
year before the family finances could support me. 
OK, but before we get to that, tell me what your

16:12.928 --> 16:17.856
favorite subjects were while you were in grade and 
high school. Well, I don't recall that I had any

16:19.642 --> 16:22.405
favorites in grade school.

16:25.388 --> 16:32.936
And we were sort of taught to treat them all alike, 
you know, excel in all of them. It's interesting,

16:32.956 --> 16:39.824
reading, writing, and arithmetic, we heard a lot 
of in terms, those terms, when I was going to grade

16:32.956 --> 16:39.824
school.

16:41.566 --> 16:44.569
And I don't know that... arithmetic never was, or 
math was never my favorite. I never felt extended

16:48.988 --> 16:58.863
in

16:48.988 --> 16:58.863
reading and writing, but I did like composition. 
We had the interscholastic league meets from the

16:59.403 --> 17:07.536
time I entered school through the high school year 
that you may be familiar with the old pattern, it

16:59.403 --> 17:07.536
isn't there anymore. But this little country 
school became famous for winning the rural

17:12.562 --> 17:18.828
classification championships in those 
inter-classics and the league meets nearly every

17:12.562 --> 17:18.828
year. Well, I always won the spelling, so I became, 
I

17:18.868 --> 17:28.719
thought, an accomplished speller through those 
grades. But in high school, I was fortunate to have

17:30.200 --> 17:41.792
a very strong English department and English 
teacher and math teacher. I think any youngster

17:43.747 --> 17:52.899
that goes to college then or today finds those are 
the two things that probably strain him the most.

17:53.540 --> 17:57.004
And if you don't have a good basis, it's difficult. 
We got a good basis, I think. So you were good in math

17:58.947 --> 18:01.090
and in English. I thought I was better in English, 
but I could handle the math. Were you a good

18:07.899 --> 18:08.740
student? Oh, I think so. If I look back on it, I... I 
was trying pretty well to do what was expected of me

18:13.177 --> 18:20.649
when I was in grade school and high school. But if 
you look back on it, I could have done better. I

18:23.053 --> 18:24.776
guess we all can look back and see that. Were you 
involved in a lot of organizations? In high

18:29.825 --> 18:35.554
school, I became involved in a few things, but not 
much. And the reason was that I was riding a school

18:35.654 --> 18:39.100
bus from here Actually, this property of ours, our 
home, is in the Kemp School District. But because

18:45.480 --> 18:56.532
my mother taught in Kauffman and my father 
attended there,

18:45.480 --> 18:56.532
they guided us to Kauffman for high school. And 
about the time I started, my two older brothers

18:56.552 --> 19:03.660
stayed with my uncle during the week when they went 
to high school. But when I started, the bus service

19:04.460 --> 19:06.443
started. And when it rained, You and I went over 
that tree, limb-covered road across Walnut

19:10.670 --> 19:17.539
Creek. When it rained, I had to walk from here on 
another mile from where you and I turned around. So

19:23.786 --> 19:24.687
you had a good walk. So I had no time for after 
school. I tried football, for example, and there

19:27.711 --> 19:33.338
was no way in the world for me to get back and forth 
with football. Now, my older brother, Walter, was

19:33.358 --> 19:40.407
a very fine football player, but he lived with his 
uncle, and he could do that. I had really very few

19:41.112 --> 19:46.819
activities

19:41.112 --> 19:46.819
as extracurricular activities. I was president 
of my junior class, and I was a salutatorian of my

19:48.902 --> 19:57.293
senior class in high school. When I got to A&M, of 
course, I did get involved in quite a number of

19:57.313 --> 20:02.820
activities. Would you consider yourself as 
president of your junior class in high school? A

20:10.728 --> 20:12.971
leader? I think so. I don't think we were as 
conscious of it then. I

20:17.759 --> 20:24.148
think popularity had a lot to do with it, but I think 
respect had more. And if I'm correct in that, I

20:25.350 --> 20:30.177
guess there's some leadership reflection there. 
Were you popular? Well, I was well-liked, I think.

20:33.803 --> 20:39.451
But you were respected then? I think so. And it was a 
combination of those two that resulted in... Yes,

20:45.462 --> 20:48.347
of course, when you say you respected, there are a 
number of things behind that. Oh, sure. You say,

20:48.968 --> 20:56.901
sure, like personality and achievement,

20:48.968 --> 20:56.901
conduct. Because I'm always wondering when 
leaders began... feeling like they're leaders or

21:01.876 --> 21:06.623
begin taking the responsibility of leadership 
roles. And I find that while I'm talking to

21:07.243 --> 21:15.775
different generals, some of them didn't start 
until their 20s, and some of them always remember

21:07.243 --> 21:15.775
taking that responsibility even when they were 
teenagers. I was wondering when you first started

21:16.316 --> 21:22.485
taking the responsibilities of a leader. Well, I 
guess that was it. I think you're entirely right in

21:26.210 --> 21:29.875
this search for leadership characteristics. 
Certainly one that the Army and the other armed

21:30.732 --> 21:44.853
forces have given a great deal of study and 
attention to, trying to understand this and

21:30.732 --> 21:44.853
trying to determine how you can place your bets on 
these young people that come into the Army. Sure. I

21:46.676 --> 21:50.141
think you're right. We can take ten people and 
their leadership ability has probably surfaced

21:50.201 --> 21:57.212
at different stages depending upon or being 
determined by the experiences and the tests that

21:58.070 --> 22:04.999
they were put to. I recall

22:06.662 --> 22:25.647
after World War II I came to A&M for duty on the 
military staff there, and I remember when we were

22:06.662 --> 22:25.647
at summer camp with our cadets, the Department of 
the Army sent a team down to

22:06.662 --> 22:25.647
try to determine criteria for leadership and see 
if they could measure it in those cadets and of

22:26.774 --> 22:55.313
course all of the officers such as such as I were 
interviewed our ideas sought and so forth well I

22:26.774 --> 22:55.313
had World War II under my belt not a lot of years in 
the service but a lot quite a lot of experience but I

22:26.774 --> 22:55.313
said then and I believe today that leadership 
really in terms of military leadership is

22:56.913 --> 23:10.467
acquired by a series of successful experiences, 
the little ones building to bigger ones, and then

22:56.913 --> 23:10.467
you really know whether you've got it or not. Let me 
interrupt just for one minute. Do you like chicken

23:12.409 --> 23:13.750
curry? I love it. Do you? I do. You know, I think 
maybe I'll just whip up some curry and have some

23:15.492 --> 23:20.657
salad and then just stay home. Okay. Because Ken's 
going to be late. Fine. Are you sure you like it? I

23:25.121 --> 23:26.563
love curry. Good.

23:29.870 --> 23:36.322
Of course, that

23:29.870 --> 23:36.322
leadership ability is built on experience. Of 
course, you've got to have certain inherent

23:36.342 --> 23:47.362
capabilities to keep moving up that line of 
success in experience. You started taking on the

23:48.264 --> 23:53.734
role later when you were a teenager. I would say 
that that was on the bottom of the rungs of this

23:54.001 --> 24:00.371
experience ladder, yes.

24:04.598 --> 24:08.945
Did you have a definite set of aims when you 
graduated from high school? I really did not in

24:11.048 --> 24:13.572
terms of specifics. I had these aims.

24:18.200 --> 24:21.645
One aim was to get a good college education.

24:24.038 --> 24:31.268
And I felt that would lead me to a further 
definition of my aims. And I think it did.

24:32.150 --> 24:41.423
Unfortunately

24:32.150 --> 24:41.423
or unfortunately, World War II interrupted the 
chain of events. And as you know, my class of 41,

24:41.443 --> 24:48.052
A&M, were all called to active duty on graduation.

24:48.072 --> 24:53.320
But that was my primary goal, was to get a good 
college education. But after that, it was pretty

24:53.553 --> 24:57.759
vague. Well, in terms of generalities, I wanted to 
be a success at whatever I engaged in. But you

25:02.365 --> 25:03.687
didn't know what field. I majored in marketing and 
finance at A&M, and I wanted to get into banking. I

25:08.914 --> 25:19.408
had been accepted for employment in the Federal 
Land Bank in Houston upon graduation with the— the

25:21.498 --> 25:28.727
prospect, I'd be too strong to say a promise, that I 
would be trained in all departments before I was

25:21.498 --> 25:28.727
finally placed. In other words, I would be what 
they call these days, and we didn't hear the term

25:31.150 --> 25:37.639
then, was a junior executive trainee.

25:40.162 --> 25:41.584
Well, that suited me just fine. But of course, I 
never went to that job because I was ordered to

25:42.185 --> 25:45.649
active duty. How about the Depression? In what way 
did the Depression, which you grew up with during

25:48.988 --> 25:55.095
the Depression, in what way did that have an impact 
on your life? Well, of course, I remember that

25:57.618 --> 26:00.662
vividly. I was about 10 years old when that 
started.

26:06.549 --> 26:16.260
And I guess the main

26:06.549 --> 26:16.260
impression that it made on me, I didn't suffer, 
really, as a youngster. because we were

26:17.320 --> 26:19.703
fortunate. We never were hungry or lacked the 
essentials, you know, food, shelter, and

26:19.723 --> 26:26.130
clothing. The luxuries, which we never really 
partook of anyway, before or after, to any great

26:28.252 --> 26:38.023
extent, were not missed. I guess the main 
impression I got was what a tough thing this was on

26:39.465 --> 26:46.973
the people who were responsible for families My 
parents and my friends' parents, our friends and

26:47.358 --> 26:56.711
neighbors, and family, you know, uncles and so 
forth. Sure, absolutely. And, of course, it had to

26:59.515 --> 27:04.943
create wonderment as to how can this happen? You 
know, just a kid, you have no capability to analyze

27:05.464 --> 27:11.933
it, but you sure can ask the question. And I guess 
that...

27:20.163 --> 27:23.489
One of my impressions was that I never want this to 
happen to me. In my family. You know, as an adult.

27:29.259 --> 27:32.604
And what kind of action did you take to free 
yourself? Well, that's just more inspiration to

27:32.624 --> 27:35.129
succeed. To take life seriously.

27:41.499 --> 27:42.441
To meet...

27:44.834 --> 27:51.824
Of course, as youngsters, your goals are set out 
for you by your parents if they're doing their job,

27:44.834 --> 27:51.824
and mine were. But when you take off for 
university, then you're on your own. You've got to

27:55.048 --> 27:58.413
make your own objectives and thereafter. Of 
course, this is during the New Deal, Franklin

28:00.215 --> 28:08.888
Roosevelt, so I was wondering what political 
persuasion your father was and what one you came to

28:00.215 --> 28:08.888
accept. My father was a very loyal Democrat. Of 
course, in those days, Republicans were still

28:13.172 --> 28:20.940
carpetbaggers.

28:20.960 --> 28:26.186
When I left the Army, and until I left the Army, I was 
never active in politics at all.

28:29.049 --> 28:36.077
In fact, I don't think I really, I always felt 
professional military people were outside the

28:29.049 --> 28:36.077
realm of politics. Now, the franchise, the vote's 
important, but I never really felt that I needed

28:42.361 --> 28:47.369
that, except wartime I liked to vote who was going 
to lead us. Who did you vote for then during the war?

28:50.354 --> 28:53.739
Well, I always voted for Roosevelt. I think he was a 
great war leader. And of course, at that time we had

28:57.245 --> 29:08.042
our great Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House, and he 
and my father were friends, by the way. Sam Rayburn

29:08.502 --> 29:10.225
knew all the community leaders in his district.

29:15.963 --> 29:26.755
Anyway, I was not conscious of politics, ever 
really, until as I was winding up my military

29:15.963 --> 29:26.755
career. My last assignment was as chief of 
legislative liaison for the Army, which meant I

29:27.275 --> 29:38.507
was the senior liaison officer with the Congress.

29:40.377 --> 29:49.289
This, for the first time, gave me very close 
association and view of the federal government,

29:40.377 --> 29:49.289
and specifically the Congress.

29:52.513 --> 30:05.270
I'm still shocked to hear people in my present 
environment sound off about how lousy those

29:52.513 --> 30:05.270
members of Congress are, and they're all crooks. 
But I came away from that experience with a much

30:05.290 --> 30:09.135
enhanced regard for the total system of our 
government that our Constitution writers set up

30:10.330 --> 30:25.551
and a much more aware appreciation of the Congress 
as a as an institution and of the individuals in the

30:10.330 --> 30:25.551
Congress. They're among the most among the 
hardest working people I've ever known and for the

30:25.591 --> 30:38.749
most part extremely conscientious people.

30:38.769 --> 30:39.730
I have taken the the liberty to rebut some of these 
comments about our government and our

30:41.077 --> 30:46.863
congressmen. But, of course, in this country, we 
all have the right to say these things. We're very

30:50.867 --> 30:53.130
prone to do it because we hired them, you know. Oh, 
yeah, right. But I say if you threw a fishnet around

30:55.032 --> 31:05.223
100 guys in Kauffman and then took a look at each one 
of them individually, there'd be some of them

30:55.032 --> 31:05.223
you'd want to throw back. There's going to be two or 
three of them. that you'd rather not net. And I

31:14.350 --> 31:19.016
think it's about the same measure in Congress. We 
just hear so much about those who do stray and err

31:19.036 --> 31:27.065
and show up to be crooks or immoral. There are not 
many of them. No. Were you ever a member of a

31:31.891 --> 31:34.434
political party then? Well, when I did leave the 
Army and had that experience with the Congress, I

31:34.554 --> 31:41.222
felt very strongly that Every citizen should get 
involved because politics is defined as the art of

31:41.371 --> 31:49.358
governing, and we're supposed to govern 
ourselves. If we can't contribute to it, we have no

31:49.578 --> 31:59.327
right to make that criticism or complain about 
conditions as they are. But I became a Democrat

31:59.547 --> 32:11.158
because, well, you might say my heritage was that, 
and I'd always felt associated with it, although I

31:59.547 --> 32:11.158
was never active before. sometimes I wonder and I 
guess we all do

32:11.543 --> 32:39.627
whether I should say I'm a Democrat or join the 
Republican Party because on some issues I'm very

32:11.543 --> 32:39.627
much on that side other issues I think my party that 
I've chosen to support is correct I basically feel

32:11.543 --> 32:39.627
that It's not right to call yourself an 
independent because we do have a two-party system

32:41.193 --> 32:49.182
and I think it's very important to us. And as a 
matter of fact, I regret now that the Republicans

32:49.202 --> 33:01.956
didn't gain control of the House of 
Representatives so that they would control the

32:49.202 --> 33:01.956
White House and the Senate and the House. Just as I 
felt that while Mr. Carter was not my choice, and

33:10.302 --> 33:15.548
among the nominees to be president or candidate 
for the Democratic Party. Once he was nominated,

33:16.829 --> 33:28.803
as far as I was concerned, he looked acceptable, 
and I supported him, and I knew it was impossible to

33:16.829 --> 33:28.803
have a Republican Congress, so no one really, it 
just makes sense, let's get one party

33:16.829 --> 33:28.803
responsible. And if they don't hack it, then the 
other party has the absolute right to be elected.

33:36.121 --> 33:37.423
to have their hand in it. Well, the Republicans 
almost did, and I wish they had, because then

33:37.443 --> 33:47.097
they'd have full responsibility for the 
leadership of the government. So in 1976, then,

33:47.157 --> 33:52.425
you supported Jimmy Carter, and then in 1980, you 
supported Ronald Reagan? That's right. I think

33:53.486 --> 33:56.911
Mr. Carter failed. The reason I feel that one party 
feels so strongly one party should control the

33:56.931 --> 34:02.820
federal government We had two terms of, well, Mr. 
President Eisenhower had a Democratic Congress.

34:10.771 --> 34:12.874
President Nixon had a Democratic Congress. I saw 
President Nixon's administration at first hand.

34:17.380 --> 34:30.299
And I think that division is very bad for us, that 
division of responsibility, with one party

34:17.380 --> 34:30.299
responsible for making the laws and another party 
responsible for carrying them out. And look at

34:30.319 --> 34:34.545
what's going on in the House of Representatives 
today. foot dragging in me, or simply to express an

34:35.133 --> 34:41.964
individuality of view. And I think Democrats are 
good people, but I think it's time that the

34:42.385 --> 34:51.279
Republicans run this thing and be responsible for 
it. Sure. For the good and the bad. Yes, sir. I'm

34:57.338 --> 34:58.800
somewhat confused then. Would you say that you're 
a conservative or a moderate or a liberal? How

35:02.445 --> 35:22.470
would you define your personal... Well, I don't 
think that's very hard to do because

35:02.445 --> 35:22.470
if you just look at the last ten years since I've 
been, shall we say, exercising my franchise to

35:02.445 --> 35:22.470
vote and participate in politics...

35:24.678 --> 35:27.201
the color of conservatives has changed a great 
deal.

35:30.105 --> 35:46.005
And on the other hand, liberals, we don't see near 
as much evidence of the liberals today as we did two

35:30.105 --> 35:46.005
Congresses ago, when we swept in a whole huge 
numbers of young liberals. I don't think that's a

35:47.387 --> 35:48.789
fair way to do it. I think that the conditions in the 
country change, and I think the things that are

35:54.580 --> 36:23.440
important to me are very important to me is of 
course first of all national security you would

35:54.580 --> 36:23.440
expect that given my career and so I spend a great 
deal of time excuse this throat I don't know why I'm

35:54.580 --> 36:23.440
getting all tangled up here well let me finish this

35:54.580 --> 36:23.440
I am a great conservative when it comes to national 
security because I think that we're gambling with

36:24.331 --> 36:46.914
the security of this nation to adopt a strategy as 
did

36:24.331 --> 36:46.914
President Kennedy and Johnson with Robert 
McNamara, Secretary of Defense, that being equal

36:24.331 --> 36:46.914
is good enough. I know it's awfully hard to 
determine when you're equal or you're superior or

36:48.495 --> 36:52.279
you're But we cannot gamble with the... 
Somebody's got to make that judgment, and we

36:53.356 --> 37:00.686
cannot gamble with the security of this nation. So 
I'm very conservative on that issue. I think our

37:06.194 --> 37:12.964
international relations are, of course, allied 
to this very, very closely. And so international

37:14.867 --> 37:18.672
affairs are of great interest to me. And I don't 
know what's a conservative in international

37:20.272 --> 37:25.458
affairs or what's a liberal. But if being 
conservative is to resist the very thought of any

37:26.419 --> 37:37.492
further communist encroachment into the Western 
hemisphere, then I'm a conservative. The people

37:39.034 --> 37:48.625
who say let the Central Americans determine their 
own fate down there, I've served in Latin America,

37:39.034 --> 37:48.625
and I know how these are determined. And I think 
we're stupid if we let that happen. We've got to

37:52.144 --> 38:00.292
influence it, and we've got to influence it in our 
favor for our future as a nation and for the future

37:52.144 --> 38:00.292
of our people. Somewhere in here, economics 
stands

38:01.533 --> 38:10.421
right up alongside these things. In fact, they're 
the base from which the strength flows for

38:10.481 --> 38:17.127
national security and an effective foreign 
policy. So are you conservative or liberal on

38:17.917 --> 38:20.239
economics? So on economics, I'm liberal in the 
sense of opening trade. I don't believe in

38:27.305 --> 38:33.631
tariffs, barriers.

38:36.093 --> 38:45.041
I really don't believe in subsidies for 
international trade, but that's very common

38:36.093 --> 38:45.041
throughout the world. What about subsidies for 
farm products? I

38:47.600 --> 38:53.950
don't believe in subsidies as such for farm 
products. I would rather, and I believe most

38:54.090 --> 39:13.860
people in agriculture, and I'm just dabbling in 
it, would much rather see a free up of the markets

38:54.090 --> 39:13.860
plus the knowledge that they can get a federal 
federally guaranteed loan if they just looked too

39:14.195 --> 39:23.424
bad on the books for the bankers to say, I can't do it 
because bank regulations won't let me. I think

39:24.645 --> 39:26.126
most farmers would be happy with that. So I guess 
I'm

39:27.167 --> 39:34.414
a moderate, I guess, because somewhere in the 
middle is the average of my views. I only forgot one

39:34.494 --> 39:35.615
thing. That's social legislation or social 
programs. Do you consider yourself a moderate? I

39:40.660 --> 39:42.902
would say I'm a moderate on social legislation. 
legislation or social programs. I think we've

39:46.387 --> 39:47.909
gone far overboard. But I think that, for example, 
I think Social Security is a fine thing. It's a

39:54.299 --> 39:57.944
must.

39:59.827 --> 40:05.916
But I believe also that Mr. Reagan is correct, that 
he's gotten all out of focus. It's become many

40:06.717 --> 40:11.404
things other than the intended floor for the 
person who has to quit work or retire. It's become

40:15.160 --> 40:17.443
an education vehicle for the kids. It's become a 
disability compensation program. It's become a

40:22.087 --> 40:31.397
very, very expensive thing. Now, on other social 
programs, I believe that there should be some kind

40:31.417 --> 40:41.847
of a medical insurance program. that protects 
every family or every individual from that

40:44.307 --> 40:49.054
disastrous illness. But to be able to go to your 
doctor because you don't feel well and have the

40:51.318 --> 40:57.328
government pay for it, I don't believe in that. I do 
believe because we certainly practice this in the

40:59.251 --> 41:09.707
military, but preventive health measures are 
much less expensive than that. Corrective, just

41:09.856 --> 41:14.583
like preventive maintenance is better than 
mechanics repairs on your automobile. But

41:15.764 --> 41:17.967
somewhere we've gone too far in this. Medicaid, 
Medicare, and so forth. I think it's too

41:23.215 --> 41:26.379
expensive. Well, we're ready to start A&M, but 
first we're going to get some water for you. Now,

41:31.186 --> 41:35.091
let's continue. And I wanted to know if... Why did 
you decide to go to A&M? Here you have an older

41:41.598 --> 41:45.404
brother, one going to TCU, and one going to A&M. Why 
A&M? Probably because my older brother went there

41:48.348 --> 41:56.400
and was going there, and I had some good friends. 
One of my closest friends went to A&M. He was ahead

42:00.866 --> 42:05.833
of me a year in high school.

42:07.872 --> 42:15.764
And to tell you the truth, I didn't study the field 
of universities available to me like youngsters

42:07.872 --> 42:15.764
do now. Yeah. A&M attracted my attention, and it 
seemed just the place I ought to go. There were no

42:25.379 --> 42:27.922
other alternatives then, really? I never really 
considered them. And as a matter of fact, I had to

42:29.305 --> 42:36.175
wait a year after graduating high school before 
I'd go to A&M. And then I wasn't sure I was going to be

42:37.268 --> 42:40.231
able to enroll that fall. All of a sudden, Dad says, 
well, that's what's important. You better get on

42:45.255 --> 42:46.456
down to A&M. This is like a week before school 
started. So this friend took me down, and there I

42:48.958 --> 42:53.122
was. That year I was out of school, I should 
mention, was a very valuable year to me. Because in

43:00.989 --> 43:05.533
those days, see, we were graduating high school at 
the age of 17. We only had 11. grades in school. And I

43:11.249 --> 43:15.153
couldn't go to school for financial reasons. And 
so I stayed out. And that was the first year that

43:17.576 --> 43:26.587
Coffman High School offered what they call 
postgraduate courses, which I guess they now call

43:17.576 --> 43:26.587
continuing education. And so I enrolled to keep 
active. And I took bookkeeping,

43:31.413 --> 43:38.241
vocational agriculture, Typing, I guess that was 
it. And at the same time, you were living out here

43:44.752 --> 43:47.617
helping your father on the ranch? Living out here 
helping my dad. As a matter of fact, that cotton gin

43:49.220 --> 43:56.852
down there you saw, old building, that cotton gin 
was operating. And dad hurt himself in that cotton

43:56.872 --> 44:01.760
gin. He had an injury to his knee, and he was just 
laid up. And I had to drop out of post-graduate

44:06.318 --> 44:08.561
school. And I actually ran that cotton gin as 
manager and chief honcho for the rest of the

44:09.422 --> 44:18.072
season, about two and a half months. And that was a 
very good experience. I was responsible for

44:20.715 --> 44:31.187
keeping the books, collecting, paying the 
customer for his seed, and seeing that everybody

44:20.715 --> 44:31.187
was there for work, and we had what we needed and 
everything. Very fine experience. And that's why

44:32.088 --> 44:35.532
I mentioned to you earlier that I probably got more 
education that year than any other year of my

44:36.035 --> 44:38.718
schooling. That was a lot of responsibility for a 
17-year-old. Very good experience. And how many

44:43.304 --> 44:46.107
people did you have working for you then? The 
minimum crew down there was four more, four

44:47.469 --> 44:54.518
additional people, five additional people. You 
had a man on the section, you had a fireman, you had a

44:54.538 --> 45:00.405
gym stand operator, and you had two people up in the 
press room. So you were at 17. You were in charge of

45:03.802 --> 45:05.684
five of them. Of course, I grew up with that cotton 
gin. I worked in there every year until we went to

45:07.667 --> 45:14.317
school. In those days, too, we started school late 
so people couldn't have time to use the kids and get

45:14.357 --> 45:21.247
their crops in. But anyway, I went on to A&M. And if 
you'd like to hear a little bit of my entry there, I

45:24.472 --> 45:31.843
like to recall this aspect. Would you like to cut 
this off? I have a feeling that's the phone is for

45:34.583 --> 45:36.325
me. I roomed at A&M with one guy all four years. Who 
was that? Gabe D. Anderson, Jr.

45:43.635 --> 45:55.791
And real interesting, with that short notice of 
going to A&M, I was too late to get in the dormitory.

45:55.811 --> 46:00.177
And as I was standing in line registering after I 
got down there, I had signed up to go into a project

46:01.591 --> 46:10.481
house they called, you're probably familiar with 
what that was, because a coffin boy got me in there

46:01.591 --> 46:10.481
as a place to stay. But standing in line, I was right 
next in line with Gabe D. Anderson, Jr. of Farwell,

46:12.043 --> 46:20.333
Texas. And it seemed like we were in line most of the 
day, but of course that's an exaggeration. But

46:24.298 --> 46:28.763
anyway, I got to know that guy right there. He 
impressed me so. I guess both of us were a little

46:30.400 --> 46:32.862
lonesome and looking for a friend. But he told me, 
he said, I'm in C Battery Field Artillery, and

46:34.184 --> 46:40.209
said, I bet you can get in there. So anyway, I looked 
into it, and a very prominent Kauffman fellow was

46:42.231 --> 46:50.839
in C Battery. He was a junior. He was a junior yell 
leader. And so I went over to Anderson's room one

46:59.641 --> 47:01.910
day and saw Charlie Trail. And Charlie got me in. It 
took a couple of weeks for a vacant city to show up,

47:04.882 --> 47:07.833
and I got in there. But anyway, I felt I was so 
fortunate to
