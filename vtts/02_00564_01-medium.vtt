WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:04.860
See ya! This is an interview. My name is Isabel 
Fernandez, and today's date is the 17th of

00:07.814 --> 00:14.042
November of 1984. I'm going to interview 
Francisco Jose Guerrero from El Salvador, son of

00:14.182 --> 00:27.038
Francisco Jose Guerrero, leader of National 
Conciliation Party, PCN. Today we're going to

00:27.779 --> 00:34.628
discuss US influence on El Salvador elections of 
1984. Now, tell me something about your father.

00:38.528 --> 00:58.101
Well, he, in 1961, when there was military power in 
El Salvador, there were a few military people and

00:38.528 --> 00:58.101
conservative people get together and formed the 
PCN, which was a rough copy of the PRI. from Mexico.

01:00.431 --> 01:08.242
Then, you know, they had a Congress election, and 
PCN took all the seats in the Congress. And my

01:09.223 --> 01:11.746
father got elected president of the Congress. 
That was 1962. But the president was, who was it,

01:13.429 --> 01:16.533
Molina? No, it was Rivera, Coronel Rivera. Then in 
67, it was General... General

01:28.557 --> 01:42.682
Fidel Sanchez Hernandez got elected president 
from the PCN party, and my father was elected

01:28.557 --> 01:42.682
minister of foreign affairs. Oh, okay. In 71, the 
military took

01:45.687 --> 01:53.721
the whole control of the PCN party. which, you 
know, my father didn't like at all, because, you

01:54.005 --> 02:01.073
know, it was a mix-up between conservative people 
and military people. So he resigned. From the PCN.

02:05.337 --> 02:05.998
From the PCN. That was 71. And he got out of the 
politics until 80...

02:14.067 --> 02:15.068
It was 80. The PCN party got thrown out of power by 
some military... in 1979. It was October 15, 1979.

02:27.319 --> 02:29.883
And they were hassled. They were threatened. They 
couldn't have meeting together because the

02:32.526 --> 02:41.899
military junta was to kill that party. They 
decided that they didn't want no PCN to exist. Then

02:47.658 --> 02:55.806
my father and some other conservative people 
started rebuilding the party for the 82 election.

02:56.347 --> 03:00.391
But there was another party formed from the PCN, 
which was ARENA.

03:04.655 --> 03:09.540
In 72, there was Coronel Molina, the president. 
And in 77, it was Coronel Romero, the president.

03:14.140 --> 03:24.657
Both of those people that formed the government, 
that the PCN took from 72 to 79, those were the

03:14.140 --> 03:24.657
people who formed ARENA.

03:27.421 --> 03:33.351
Which, you know, it was more, they were more 
conservative. than the PCN really was. So it was

03:35.963 --> 03:37.565
more right. That's what they call the 
ultra-right. And in 81, my father, he decided to

03:41.489 --> 03:47.416
start rebuilding the PCN, as I was saying. And then 
in 82, we won 14 congressmen out of 60. The

03:58.689 --> 04:02.173
Democratic Party got 24 and Arena got 19. Okay. 
Then my father got elected prime minister for that

04:06.955 --> 04:12.223
because, you know, they divided. It was a Congress 
election in 82. So they all got together to form a

04:15.808 --> 04:22.678
coalition government, all the parties. And my 
father got elected prime minister. In 81. In 82.

04:26.423 --> 04:28.165
Oh, 82. Then he resigned in 82. In 83... And by the 
end of 83, he resigned because he was going to run

04:31.651 --> 04:40.720
for president for the PCN party. In 1984? In 1984. 
And today he's... Today, you know, he got elected

04:45.405 --> 04:51.471
president of the Supreme Court, which is an 
election. He doesn't form, he doesn't, he's a part

04:51.491 --> 04:57.878
for the Duarte's government. Because he's 
elected from the Congress, which Duarte doesn't

04:58.111 --> 05:04.080
have the majority. So, you know, he's like the head 
of the opposition in El Salvador. Okay. And you

05:09.328 --> 05:12.753
were helping your father with the campaign of 
1980? Yeah, that's why I left from here. Because he

05:14.896 --> 05:23.950
needed help, you know, like, to trust, to have a lot 
of trust, and talking to... trying to get, you

05:24.622 --> 05:31.592
know, whatever help we could because, you know, 
they didn't think that the PCN could be rebuilt.

05:31.612 --> 05:32.052
Oh, I see. So you were talking to the people? Yeah, I 
was talking to the people, trying to get the

05:35.077 --> 05:41.365
T-shirts, cheaper T-shirts. You know, we got 
about 200,000 plates, you know, with the PCN

05:41.385 --> 05:46.793
symbol. That's, you know, for the peasants, you 
know, some of them. All right. Okay, I'm going to

05:53.134 --> 05:55.798
ask you the first question. What sector of the 
population supported your father, Spartan?

06:01.387 --> 06:01.708
Easy. Let me explain this. Okay. Okay, now 
Salvador, we got most of the peasants. Of the

06:07.437 --> 06:08.179
peasants? But since, you know, these people, 
these people who used to own the big lands... they

06:15.297 --> 06:17.545
formed the other party, which was ARENA. Those 
were the rich people, right? Yeah, the rich

06:20.918 --> 06:21.681
people. And they tried to convince the peasants to 
vote for ARENA, not for PCN. And it got up to a point,

06:27.970 --> 06:31.395
you know, where we were really close. Arena and 
PCN. What about Duarte? Well, he was always, you

06:35.881 --> 06:38.885
know, in the head. Yeah, he was always ahead. So he 
was first, and then your father's party and Arena

06:40.347 --> 06:45.473
were second. Yeah, but, you know, we never got 
together on the second thing because all they want

06:45.493 --> 06:57.910
is... PCN was always the ultra-right party in El 
Salvador. And my father, he worked so hard to make

06:58.210 --> 07:09.342
it look, you know, to make it, to put it, put the 
party in the middle and, you know, leave it right

06:58.210 --> 07:09.342
now to the ultra right. All right. So he wanted to be 
more center. So, you know, he told all his

07:11.484 --> 07:19.553
followers that, you know, they could vote, you 
know, for whoever they want. But there is always,

07:19.974 --> 07:26.160
before, there were always two parties, PCN and 
PDC. And, you know, they're, Most of the followers

07:28.028 --> 07:32.734
were going to vote against PDC, which is Duarte's 
party. Yes, because they've been voting like that

07:33.455 --> 07:36.279
all their lives. I see. So the population that 
supported your father was the peasants, right?

07:42.427 --> 07:47.214
Most of the peasants and a few rich people, very 
few. So can it be said that your father's party was

07:47.234 --> 07:52.020
the military's party? No, no way. It was the old 
military party. The old ones. Yeah, the old ones.

07:57.743 --> 08:01.066
Like, you know, most of them, you know, are out of 
office. You know, they are generals, but, you

08:01.106 --> 08:04.269
know, out of office. So what party did the military 
support, like? Oh, you know, they... Maybe. You

08:11.716 --> 08:16.121
know, some of them went for us, some of them went for 
ARENA, most of them went for ARENA. Oh, so most of

08:16.441 --> 08:24.529
the military were... Yeah, because in El 
Salvador, since there is a war going on, there is a

08:16.441 --> 08:24.529
lot of young military people. And they are more 
into bullets than dialogue. I see. And my father

08:32.401 --> 08:36.406
was always for the dialogue. Okay. But, you know, 
we got help, Duarte got help from the military too.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.676
Oh, you know, the mayor took part in ghetto. Okay. 
Do you see any possibility of the El Salvadorian

08:44.837 --> 08:52.828
army taking over the elections since it happened 
in 1972?

08:55.525 --> 08:59.670
I don't know what happened in 72, but I don't think 
the army got control of that. That's what Duarte

09:00.992 --> 09:04.136
says. Yeah, that's what Duarte says, that he won 
the election. He really won the election, but he

09:07.180 --> 09:10.084
didn't have the majority. It was a mistake. I'm 
glad my father was out of PCN by then, because he won

09:12.928 --> 09:19.356
the election for sure, but he didn't have the 
majority. So how come he can win the election? No,

09:24.869 --> 09:28.973
because you don't need 50% plus one vote. You need 
51%. I see. So that 1% might be 1,000 votes, 10,000

09:31.936 --> 09:37.541
votes, whatever. And then that was, for me, that 
was the mistake. They could have at least give

09:42.125 --> 09:47.790
Duarte the benefit of the doubt that he won. And 
then, you know, going to Congress, which PCN had

09:48.243 --> 09:54.789
the majority, Coronel Molina was going to be 
elected anyway. As president? As president,

09:56.230 --> 09:58.552
because, you know, that's the law in El Salvador. 
If you don't get the majority, you have to go to

09:58.812 --> 10:01.615
Congress. Oh, and Congress decides. Decides who 
wins. So in this election, the Congress decides

10:04.437 --> 10:08.561
for Molina? Yeah, it was on the military people. 
Oh, okay. All right. Did the U.S. aid workers help

10:12.804 --> 10:16.888
your father with the campaign? No. We kind of were 
told that we were the favorites for the American

10:19.107 --> 10:32.725
because Duarte went too far to the left and Daweson 
went too far to the right. As you know, we got him

10:33.386 --> 10:38.312
talking to Ambassador Pickering a few times. He 
said that he'll look at good eyes if my father goes

10:38.993 --> 10:44.179
to the second round. But that's about it. No, they 
help us, you know, and getting reporters and

10:47.288 --> 10:59.446
getting, you know, a bunch of reporters and media 
to my father's rabbit. Did the U.S. aid workers

10:59.466 --> 11:03.131
help Duarte's campaign? The U.S. government 
didn't help Duarte. The AFL-CIO

11:05.795 --> 11:16.030
gave some money to the AFL-CIO corresponding to El 
Salvador. And, you know, they are the new

11:17.815 --> 11:22.881
population of El Salvador. It's like the agrarian 
reform, people who live in the parts where the

11:22.941 --> 11:30.410
agrarian reform were settled. And, you know, 
since most of them are peasants, you know, they go

11:30.430 --> 11:43.045
door by door, door by door trying to convince 
people to vote for Duarte because Duarte doesn't

11:30.430 --> 11:43.045
have a peasant support. He didn't? He didn't have 
none. I mean, he won only in three departments out

11:45.760 --> 11:54.311
of 14, which were, you know, where the big cities 
were. So he won elections in the city? Yeah, he won

11:56.874 --> 12:03.642
the election in the city, but the peasants, you 
know, always go against him because, you know. All

12:04.964 --> 12:05.224
right. Okay, it's been said that if the U.S. 
retires its help from El Salvador, the

12:05.244 --> 12:14.215
Salvadorian army will collapse. Now, it was clear 
that Reagan administration wanted Duarte to win.

12:20.363 --> 12:26.171
I mean, reading the newspaper, I always read that 
they wanted Duarte, not your father. Either

12:26.231 --> 12:29.456
Davison didn't want that one at all. So do you feel 
that these two facts put a lot of pressure on the

12:29.917 --> 12:34.103
election? People voting for Duarte because maybe 
they felt that if Davison won... You know, if you

12:41.954 --> 12:45.880
see the figures, the figures are very close. I 
think they were 50% to 48%, something like that.

12:50.406 --> 12:54.793
And you can see that most of the peasants vote 
against Duarte. They don't vote for Davison. They

12:56.075 --> 12:58.298
vote against Duarte. Yeah, but your father got 
19%. Davison got 30%. 29%. Davison, okay. 29% and

13:05.809 --> 13:08.253
Duarte got like 44%. 43%. 43%, right. So... I mean, 
a lot of people support him. He kept that vote. He

13:15.604 --> 13:20.195
kept, you know, the people that vote for him, you 
know, they vote again. People from Arena and PCN,

13:21.178 --> 13:30.000
they're more used to, since, you know, we were the 
official party for so many years. the peasants

13:30.368 --> 13:39.480
from the PCN were more used to having buses to take 
them to the boating places. And this time, since we

13:40.501 --> 13:49.053
were not an official party, neither Arena was, we 
couldn't put no buses. Oh, I see. So you see, most of

13:49.974 --> 13:53.659
the people who vote, they just vote. No, but if you 
compare the results from the first round and the

13:54.145 --> 14:01.075
second round, you'll see that Duarte kept their 
votes. He didn't win, you know, people from the PCN

14:02.016 --> 14:06.082
or people from other parties. But Arena, he won 
most of the PCN. But they didn't vote for Dawison

14:09.787 --> 14:13.592
because, you know, it was Dawison. They voted 
against Duarte. All right. So you're saying that

14:18.648 --> 14:21.831
the people didn't vote for Duarte? No. Okay, I see. 
During the campaign, did you get any threats from

14:24.374 --> 14:28.237
any side? We got threats from all sides. You see, 
since, you know, we were the middle, which

14:31.661 --> 14:36.566
Duarte's party used to be the middle party. All 
right. But the guerrillas used to be the far left.

14:41.110 --> 14:42.812
But this time, you know, we were in the middle. We 
got threatened by... leftists, by guerrillas, by

14:47.707 --> 14:50.230
right. Really? Yeah, we get, you know, there was 
once, you know, when I had to tell, you know, I had to

14:51.591 --> 15:05.406
really stand, you know, and tell them, man, if 
you're going to use that, if you're going to pull

14:51.591 --> 15:05.406
that gun, you better use it. Because, you know, 
there was this major of this city from Arena, that

15:05.426 --> 15:11.453
he just went to the rally. and says, you know, there 
is no rally in here. And I was the only one

15:14.410 --> 15:21.240
presenting my father's party in there and a group 
that was playing music. Because, you know, we were

15:21.961 --> 15:31.995
the ones that had the always very happy rallies, 
you know, music, pupusas, and everything.

15:32.035 --> 15:33.657
Because, you know, we wanted to feel happy. Most of 
our buddies are young people. All right. And, you

15:37.808 --> 15:43.976
know, this guy just went, you know, and told us he's 
the boss from that town, and I told him. So he didn't

15:44.677 --> 15:47.601
let you speak to the people? We didn't. Oh, okay. 
Because we have security, too. All right. In your

15:53.269 --> 15:58.456
opinion, why didn't the guerrillas show up their 
ballot to the elections? Because they don't have

15:58.916 --> 16:01.380
the support of the people. If they're They're 
burning buses. They're burning things that the

16:05.682 --> 16:10.687
majority of the people use. I got my own car. If they 
burn a bus in El Salvador, I'm not using that bus.

16:18.214 --> 16:20.096
The majority of the people are using it. The 
bridges, they explode. You see, I can take a plane

16:25.261 --> 16:27.924
and fly over. But the passengers, they cannot 
afford it. the majority of the support of the

16:32.348 --> 16:37.435
people they don't like for it. So you think that 
it's because they knew that the people wouldn't

16:37.455 --> 16:44.424
vote for them, so they decided not to show up? I see. 
Did you feel that the elections were a farce made in

16:46.126 --> 16:55.219
USA so that Reagan could call Congress and keep on 
sending military help? No, it wasn't. It wasn't.

16:56.981 --> 16:57.882
You see, he won. He won mainly Because it was about 
time. He's been trying for so long to be a

17:04.433 --> 17:07.778
president. He was the president of the Junta, 
which is not elected. I'm sure that if all the

17:12.986 --> 17:23.481
parties get together, all the opposition 
parties, we can beat Duarte. But we never did that.

17:25.925 --> 17:28.208
That was our promise, to let Duarte go. All right. 
Was the people forced to vote by threats from the

17:31.607 --> 17:36.934
different parties? And did they vote just out of 
fear? No, not really. You see, the people went to

17:41.921 --> 17:43.283
vote. They wanted to vote? They wanted to vote. 
They wanted to elect somebody. So, okay. You know,

17:52.375 --> 17:54.398
there were no force, no matter. Okay, after the 
first election, Duarte and his son were tied,

17:55.137 --> 17:59.825
right? And a runoff was necessary. Did your father 
get any kind of financial help from CIA so that he

18:02.911 --> 18:10.424
couldn't help Duarte, he would help Duarte? We 
couldn't, we didn't, you see, the main problem of

18:11.105 --> 18:18.879
my father's campaign was money-wise. Right. 
Because, you know, he... He paid out of his own

18:20.568 --> 18:27.818
package most of the campaign. If we could have at 
least $436,000, I think that's what they said,

18:29.400 --> 18:42.397
that my father received, and that campaign, I'm 
sure we would end up in second place. No, but I mean

18:42.417 --> 18:43.899
afterwards. Afterwards. So that your father 
wouldn't... No. We got together with the arena

18:47.855 --> 18:50.720
party to talk. And they just went, clearly, we got a 
cake. Let's divide it. Everyone can do whatever

18:58.615 --> 19:02.923
they want, but let's divide it half and half. And my 
father is not like that. See, he's been in the

19:04.886 --> 19:10.757
politics for so long that he told me, I want these 
issues. to be corrected from your party, you know,

19:11.513 --> 19:14.116
I'll give you all. Even they wanted to change that 
was on for my father. I mean, my father for that was

19:18.301 --> 19:19.683
on. And there was a law given around those days that 
my father was going to be able to run for arena. And

19:28.094 --> 19:30.016
he didn't accept. Oh, really? Yeah, he just went 
straight and told them, too much talking, and no,

19:30.837 --> 19:38.747
no, we're not doing nothing. I see. But if you 
compare figures, most of our people, we have

19:39.931 --> 19:56.218
a neutrality.

19:56.975 --> 20:01.099
But at the same time, we're against Duarte's 
party. See, most of our people vote for Arena.

20:03.921 --> 20:04.362
Okay. Davison wanted a military victory over the 
guerrillas. So did your father, right? No, my

20:10.407 --> 20:12.769
father was for the dialogue all the time. He was? 
Yeah. So that's the reason for which your father

20:15.231 --> 20:20.976
didn't help Davison on the run-up? No, it wasn't 
just because of that, because it was going to be

20:26.050 --> 20:30.495
decided between two polarizations. If that was on 
one, it was bad for our country. We could win a

20:34.720 --> 20:42.108
prison, but the country wouldn't be getting arms, 
bullets, which are needed now. So that's, you

20:44.530 --> 20:47.434
didn't, your father, okay. No, but you know, he 
went ahead and told me, you know, I'm neutral, but I

20:47.714 --> 20:53.340
like that we sound better. So if the U.S. had been 
kept out of this election, would your father have

20:54.232 --> 20:59.480
joined Aluson? No, I don't think so. Like if the 
U.S. didn't have anything to do? You know, there

21:03.866 --> 21:11.156
was one point where, you know, the support from 
both parties was almost real. Almost real. But,

21:12.358 --> 21:22.112
you know, there were people in the arena that they 
just wanted to have the power to give their farms

21:12.358 --> 21:22.112
back. give their banks back you know there were 
things it was like you know going back give their

21:23.020 --> 21:53.027
banks back to rich people so that's what that's 
what my father told me my father told me there is no

21:23.020 --> 21:53.027
way this can be done so that's the reason why your 
father didn't join the he didn't join it publicly

21:23.020 --> 21:53.027
underground I was offered to go on a commercial 
with the arena. But you just, okay, wait a minute,

21:55.841 --> 21:58.204
wait a minute. You just told me that you didn't, 
your father didn't join Davison publicly because

21:58.505 --> 22:13.206
you knew that if Davison had won the election, you 
wouldn't receive any more help. Issues, also the

22:13.226 --> 22:14.528
issues. Okay, that's the other thing, okay. Like, 
you know, like you say, he wanted a military

22:17.453 --> 22:22.440
victory. We wanted dialogue. He was, you know, to, 
my father was for, to get the, all the, all the

22:24.632 --> 22:35.584
reformers to make them good. Dawesan wanted to 
take them all out. So it sounds to me that your

22:40.029 --> 22:49.140
father was more, ideologically, he was more close 
to Duarte than to Dawesan. And the issues. Right,

22:50.585 --> 22:51.547
and the issues. And the issues. But Duarte is not, 
you know, what you're hearing here. He's not? He's

22:57.836 --> 23:02.864
not, because, you know, I was with him at, you know, 
we met with both parties. But usually with the PDC,

23:04.266 --> 23:09.775
with Duarte's party, we just had an hour or 
something like that. But with that we saw, you see,

23:11.240 --> 23:14.803
we always ended up, you know, until next day. Ah, I 
see. You know, here I read, like, I thought it was, I

23:16.985 --> 23:26.634
think Newsweek, somewhere like that, said that 
your father was helping Duarte. He was getting

23:26.794 --> 23:29.497
together with Duarte. Yeah, he was getting 
together with Duarte. Yes, he did. So publicly, he

23:32.039 --> 23:34.361
was helping Duarte? No, publicly, no. You know, 
first thing, after the first round, He said,

23:38.999 --> 23:41.242
exactly, I won't go anywhere. Whoever wants me, 
you know, go to my house. Duarte, being the first,

23:44.247 --> 23:58.088
the first, the first place, you know, in the first 
round, the election was Sunday, and he was in my

23:44.247 --> 23:58.088
house Monday at 8 o'clock in the morning. Yeah, 
because your father's party was the decisive

23:58.108 --> 24:02.274
party. Yeah, yeah. It was up to your father who was 
going to win. It was up to my father who was going to

24:04.718 --> 24:06.340
win. But it's not true that either. So your father 
didn't help any party? Well, he helped on the other

24:13.190 --> 24:15.613
table more than Davison. He helped Davison? But 
still Davison lost? But still Davison lost

24:18.977 --> 24:22.181
because he didn't win out publicly.

24:25.044 --> 24:25.365
Oh, all right. Okay, do you think that in case of a 
Davison victory, the U.S. will have taken

24:25.385 --> 24:31.652
military action? The military action against 
what? Against your country. I mean, taking

24:37.120 --> 24:39.282
like... They haven't done it in Nicaragua. So you 
don't think it will happen? Besides, you know,

24:45.328 --> 24:53.656
like Duarte says, now, you know, you can hear 
Duarte, you know, he's more, he's thinking more

24:45.328 --> 24:53.656
than talking. He says, you know, Salvadorian 
problem belongs to Salvadorian. That's ideally,

24:58.200 --> 25:01.403
actually, but I don't think that's the case. 
That's not the case because, you know, we're in a

25:01.585 --> 25:04.149
war. We depend on the states. But, you know, for 
like the dialogue that happened about three weeks

25:06.132 --> 25:13.844
ago, they didn't invite no American. So do you 
think that Davison didn't win the elections

25:13.864 --> 25:21.696
because you are in a war and you depend on the U.S.? 
Most of the people also, you see, Davison wanted a

25:21.716 --> 25:27.385
military victory. That's because, you know, he 
lives in the city. Most of the peasants live in

25:30.121 --> 25:37.410
guerrilla-controlled areas where the 
government troops always go and bomb. They want

25:38.792 --> 25:40.314
peace. They are tired of military. War and action, 
I see. Okay, will the U.S. cut financial aid if

25:47.483 --> 25:52.830
Abuson will have one? That's been told. I'm sure 
they could do that. It's up to them. We don't

25:58.893 --> 26:00.715
control the United States. They could have caught 
it if Duarte had won, too. Yeah. Well, the U.S., I

26:05.379 --> 26:10.464
mean, the Reagan administration was for Duarte. 
That's not true. Do you think not? Well, in the

26:13.587 --> 26:15.529
newspaper, that's what I got. Yeah, but that's 
what they said. AFL-CIO is the main base for the

26:16.690 --> 26:24.477
Democratic Party, not the Republican Party. And 
the United States helped Duarte Through the

26:27.952 --> 26:29.413
AFL-CIO. That's not Duarte's government. That's 
not Reagan's government. But Reagan's the one

26:34.438 --> 26:36.840
that's asking Congress. For help for the country. 
Whoever had won it. But still, if that was some...

26:45.047 --> 26:46.168
It would be harder to get. It would be harder to get. 
It would have been almost impossible to get money

26:47.569 --> 26:51.192
from Congress. That's something that, you know, 
Guatemala doesn't receive nothing from the

26:51.452 --> 26:55.656
states. Who? Guatemala. Oh, Guatemala. And 
there, you know, they kill all the guerrillas.

27:00.896 --> 27:07.342
They have more military presence than El 
Salvador, and they, you know, they just keep them

27:00.896 --> 27:07.342
going. Okay. What about if Duarte hadn't win the 
election? Do you think, okay, it was said that he

27:14.249 --> 27:21.896
had planned a popular insurrection in case of a 
Donald Trump victory. It's more like a

27:21.916 --> 27:25.920
psychological war going on, you know. They were 
saying, we got together with Duarte. That was

27:31.830 --> 27:33.652
saying that. Because my father knew that he didn't 
like to go with Duarte. And Duarte was saying, my

27:37.937 --> 27:40.961
father was going to that with some. It was just a 
psychological war. The war was nothing else.

27:47.448 --> 27:49.029
Duarte did it in 72. He got a popular insurrection, 
but he didn't work. popular insurrection and

27:54.318 --> 28:00.005
there was only a couple thousand people 
insurrected. So even if he had had an insurrection

28:00.025 --> 28:03.810
he wouldn't have done anything. Okay. Do you think 
that the problems in your country have to be

28:05.853 --> 28:14.984
settled down by bullets rather than by ballots? It 
all depends because you know they the gorillas

28:15.585 --> 28:22.654
depend on Nicaragua and They don't want to go to 
election. They want power. They don't want to die

28:25.971 --> 28:27.392
alone. If you see on the dialogue, their main, 
their main, uh, military boss, Joaquin

28:27.713 --> 28:35.502
Villalobos, he wasn't in there. Villalobos. 
Because, you know, he wanted, uh, uh, uh,

28:36.484 --> 28:44.333
helicopter, a helicopter, you know, flew him from 
wherever he was to the La Palma. And even Duarte,

28:44.674 --> 28:50.481
who is the president of El Salvador, he dropped. 
Because my father went with him. I see. So you think

28:54.391 --> 28:56.295
that... They don't really, you know, it has to be 
settled by ballots because they're going to

28:56.315 --> 29:08.317
understand, the guerrillas will understand that 
they don't have the popular support. Okay. Do you

29:08.804 --> 29:20.520
feel that no matter who the president is, the 
Salvadorian army is actually in control, and

29:08.804 --> 29:20.520
finally the U.S. is the one deciding for your 
country? That's not true either, because what is

29:20.961 --> 29:30.053
happening in El Salvador is that there is a war 
going on. have to be controlled by military

29:30.944 --> 29:33.647
people. Duarte is the head commandant of all the 
forces in Los Alamos, but he doesn't understand

29:34.649 --> 29:43.159
the war techniques. I see. So the military, they 
take care of the war, and Duarte takes care of the

29:43.860 --> 29:49.487
government. Yeah, okay. I read somewhere that the 
armed force lives with Duarte as long as he doesn't

29:50.409 --> 29:58.639
attempt to negotiate with the guerrillas or 
interfere in any significant way with the army's

29:59.024 --> 30:04.810
conduct on the war. And still, Duarte wants to have 
dialogue with the guerrillas. So how can he have

30:09.556 --> 30:15.523
dialogue if the army doesn't want him to do 
anything with the guerrillas? That's not true.

30:16.524 --> 30:22.791
You see, the dialogue, that was a few phrases, 
pretty nice. They're pals. They're old pals,

30:23.932 --> 30:27.136
Duarte and the guerrillas. It's going to be a 
monologue. And that's not true. Duarte and Ungo,

30:32.030 --> 30:34.053
they run for president. Ungo, right. They work 
together. He runs for president. But that doesn't

30:37.718 --> 30:40.862
mean they have the same ideology.

30:42.644 --> 30:44.466
But they have one thing in common. They want peace. 
But the army doesn't want peace. The army doesn't

30:49.613 --> 30:52.176
want to die alone. The army wants peace. They want 
military victory, right? you can say that they

30:56.365 --> 30:59.349
already have the military victory. Because the 
guerrillas in Nicaragua, they fought a couple

30:59.369 --> 31:10.605
years, and then Somoza, Somoza government were 
thrown out in a couple years. They've been

31:10.665 --> 31:12.928
fighting for five years in my country. They 
haven't obtained no military victory. They

31:16.092 --> 31:18.556
control certain parts of the country. But the 
peasants from there, they moved to Honduras, they

31:19.417 --> 31:25.225
moved to to places where they keep all these 
people, because they don't support the gorillas.

31:35.381 --> 31:38.567
So the army wants a military victory? They want 
some, but they already have the military victory.

31:41.993 --> 31:43.176
So how come you have war? Because if Nicaragua is in 
between, I saw some prisoners of war that didn't

31:48.560 --> 31:56.290
even talk Spanish. They were Russians? I don't 
know. They were black. From where? Nobody knows.

32:04.501 --> 32:08.926
They were just bodies.

32:09.247 --> 32:15.715
So it's more like an exterior support war against 
Osagodoro and Corbin. which the military doesn't

32:17.045 --> 32:21.530
like them to intervene. That's why they want a 
military victory, not to kill all the

32:21.550 --> 32:26.335
Salvatoreans fighting. They don't want no 
Nicaraguan going in there. Duarte wanted to have

32:30.259 --> 32:35.745
land reforms, nationalize the banks and all this. 
He already did it. Right. Has the election changed

32:37.167 --> 32:39.569
the situation at all? No, not at all. As a matter of 
fact, Arena's phrase for this next campaign They

32:47.453 --> 32:49.916
call it the hundred days of nothing. And that's 
true because, you know, there is so many things to

32:50.757 --> 33:03.114
do that it's impossible to start having results so 
fast. The land reform, you know, it was given. It

33:06.518 --> 33:09.142
couldn't have taken out. So he didn't offer it. You 
know, it was already there. Oh, it was already

33:13.948 --> 33:15.250
there. So but still Duarte cannot do too much 
because his hands are tied by the military also. No

33:24.295 --> 33:34.128
because you know as I'm saying the military people 
they're more concerned of the war matter and

33:24.295 --> 33:34.128
Duarte is more concerned about laws about you 
know. Yeah but if you in a country if you have a war

33:39.715 --> 33:42.819
the most important things, the war, right? The 
other things are like, how can you lose if there is a

33:42.839 --> 33:46.965
war? Who's going to respect that? That's what I 
mean. How could Duarte? You know, he tries, you

33:51.110 --> 33:52.993
know, and he tries hard. So it doesn't matter if you 
have a president. I mean, it doesn't make any

33:56.758 --> 33:58.340
difference. That's what you're saying. Because, 
you know, the military, you know, they're there to

34:00.743 --> 34:07.091
preserve the country. All right. And you see, they 
are taught that way. They are used to receive

34:12.785 --> 34:18.052
orders, and that's the way it should be. A war is a 
war. Okay, so you think you shouldn't have a

34:19.594 --> 34:23.018
president then? Why not? As far as you have a war, 
there's no need for a president. Even in Vietnam,

34:28.665 --> 34:38.798
when Johnson was in Vietnam, I'm sure he didn't 
have no... No, he had an ideological force sending

34:39.858 --> 34:46.046
people over there. But from over there, the 
general commander of the forces, he was in charge.

34:51.093 --> 34:58.724
So since the war is in your country, in your own 
country, then the one that's in charge is the army,

34:51.093 --> 34:58.724
right? Yeah, but Duarte, he has a lot of power, 
governmental power. Okay. Do you think What do you

35:05.997 --> 35:10.602
think about U.S. intervention on the politics of 
your country? Do you think they should be more

35:10.682 --> 35:14.386
involved or less involved? Less. You know, 
they're okay. You know, as long as they don't give

35:17.009 --> 35:23.956
you orders to do what you do, it's okay. Because, 
like, on the dialogue, Ambassador Picker, he

35:23.976 --> 35:30.403
said, you know, I'm not invited to that. It's hard 
to believe that I'm not invited. And Duarte

35:32.566 --> 35:33.827
answered, you know, Salvadorian people had to 
resolve their problems. Alright. What about

35:39.318 --> 35:42.561
financial help? We needed it because you know we 
were the most progressive country in Latin

35:42.601 --> 35:54.572
America in 77 and 78 in Latin America, Venezuela, 
Colombia. Because you know the Salvadorian

35:55.933 --> 35:59.817
people love to work. They are hard working people. 
Okay. So you think that the involvement of the U.S.

36:03.946 --> 36:07.511
is all right? It's financial and military 
because, you know, we cannot win a war if we have a

36:07.972 --> 36:14.482
machine gun but no bullets. Do you think they 
should send more military help to Salvador? Yeah.

36:19.189 --> 36:19.429
Yes? So they should get more involved financially 
but not... Financially and military because

36:24.377 --> 36:27.622
we're... But not deciding. Not deciding. Yes, you 
know, whatever the government asks them for.

36:34.220 --> 36:34.761
Okay. All right. Okay, tell me, what do you think 
that are the causes of the revolution in your

36:38.765 --> 36:45.453
country? Are they social problems or Marxism? You 
know, it started as a... Okay, social problems,

36:53.243 --> 36:56.427
right. It started like, you know, they were asking 
for social reforms. So social problems. Yeah, but

37:01.713 --> 37:02.674
you see... In El Salvador, there were people with a 
lot of lands, a lot of farms. But these people who

37:09.128 --> 37:16.140
had the biggest land, you know, they treated their 
peasants in those lands nicer than anybody else.

37:17.723 --> 37:20.147
Like, you know, I know La Carrera, which was the 
biggest one. He had TVs, radio. He had, I think in

37:26.397 --> 37:35.909
eight or nine schools, he had a hospital, which, 
you know, the one who owns the land, the owner of the

37:26.397 --> 37:35.909
land, he built them for the peasants. So they'll be 
happy. Right now, they don't have electricity,

37:37.270 --> 37:45.040
they don't have TVs, they have schools, but, you 
know, they don't have no teachers. The hospital

37:46.181 --> 37:48.103
doesn't have any medicines. That's because the 
people who get control of that farm after the

37:49.124 --> 37:54.531
agrarian reform They didn't know. They didn't 
have any buying power. Which, you know, if one guy

37:58.106 --> 38:04.355
owns this, you know, they have buying power. Okay, 
so it started out like social problems. But then,

38:07.539 --> 38:10.363
you know, it got controlled by Marxists. But now 
it's controlled by Marxists. So you think that...

38:11.765 --> 38:22.020
Because, you know, the peasants, they noticed 
that the leaders of the revolution were pure blah,

38:11.765 --> 38:22.020
blah, blah. I see. You know, they just wanted, you 
know, Marxism. Because you can see Ungo, he's

38:27.110 --> 38:30.434
always traveling in first class. Really. Okay. 
Ungo Samayo, which was a professor of mine, you

38:33.859 --> 38:40.147
know, he always traveled in first class. When he 
came to A&M, you know, I took his tie and said, Peter

38:40.167 --> 38:47.576
Cardan, man, looks nice on you. Because, you know, 
if they are Marxists, you know, They should dress

38:50.755 --> 38:51.957
like that. They shouldn't be wearing no... Okay, 
who do you think supports the guerrillas?

39:01.330 --> 39:03.733
Nicaragua mainly, Cuba. So you're saying that no 
Salvadorian peasants are supporting the

39:03.753 --> 39:08.860
guerrillas? Well, not all of them. But the 
majority? The majority is what I'm saying. He

39:13.467 --> 39:17.893
doesn't have not even 40% of the peasants. of the 
population of El Salvador, because otherwise,

39:18.869 --> 39:23.237
you know, they could have already won the war. If 
the, like Somoza, Somoza, it was anti-Somosist.

39:29.288 --> 39:32.454
You know, everybody got together and threw him 
out. But in El Salvador, there is no way, because

39:32.474 --> 39:37.744
they didn't have political support. But also, the 
guerrillas haven't won the war because the U.S.

39:37.824 --> 39:42.953
helped. That's not true because, you know, we 
receive more help from a bunch of people than from

39:44.097 --> 39:49.169
the States. More help from other countries? Like 
Israel helps a lot, a lot more than the United

39:50.793 --> 39:54.122
States. Really? I see. All right. So I think that's 
it. Thank you very much.
