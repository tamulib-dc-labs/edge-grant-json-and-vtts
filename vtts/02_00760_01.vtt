00:05.735 --> 00:10.060
This is Martha Hunt interviewing Dr. Jane Sell on 
Women in Academia. Dr. Sell, how long have you been

00:11.241 --> 00:13.323
teaching? At Texas A&M? Well, and any college. 
Okay, well I taught for three years when I was a

00:17.668 --> 00:27.539
graduate student, and we had responsibility for 
two courses when you're a graduate student. You

00:27.759 --> 00:28.821
know, you teach it on your own. It's an 
individually taught course. And then here, I've

00:30.803 --> 00:34.527
been here since 1978, so that's... Okay, and where 
did you go to school for your graduate and your

00:35.924 --> 00:41.591
undergraduate? I went to the University of 
Wisconsin for my undergraduate degree, and I went

00:41.611 --> 01:00.936
to Texas A&M for my master's,

00:41.611 --> 01:00.936
and I went to Washington State for my Ph.D.

00:41.611 --> 01:00.936
And what made you decide to become a professor?

01:04.392 --> 01:11.723
Well, I wasn't sure about really what I wanted to do 
at all when I first entered the master's program.

01:11.763 --> 01:13.926
And even all through the master's program, I 
wasn't sure. But near the end of the time, I got

01:14.687 --> 01:21.937
really interested in a specific area, you know, 
experimental social psychology. And then when I,

01:22.819 --> 01:25.963
you know, I decided that's what I wanted to go into. 
And then when I went into the Ph.D. program, I

01:26.023 --> 01:32.172
developed this, what I describe as a passion for 
it. And I really enjoyed teaching, and that's what

01:32.422 --> 01:35.086
I wanted to do. I mean, I just discovered that I 
wanted to do it. And, um, were you married at the

01:39.291 --> 01:48.423
time when you were getting your PhD, or were you 
married after you came in? No, I, uh, yeah, I got

01:48.463 --> 01:53.229
married in 1980 after I'd been here for three 
years. Was it hard choosing between a family and a

01:53.690 --> 01:59.037
career, or was that choice necessary?

02:01.649 --> 02:08.199
I don't think, a lot of people I think are faced, a 
lot of women are faced with that kind of dilemma, I

02:01.649 --> 02:08.199
think. But for me, since I had waited so long to get 
married, it became more of a matter of

02:09.061 --> 02:15.771
organization. But I think, I think in the 
beginning, I think there is kind of a choice

02:16.673 --> 02:25.547
sometimes, but I think that you can do both if you 
try to assure yourself that you don't have to be a

02:27.198 --> 02:33.813
superwoman, that you realize that you have limits 
on the time that you have and you try to organize it.

02:34.394 --> 02:38.644
I think it's very hard for people to go through 
graduate school and have a family. I mean, I'm

02:38.704 --> 02:40.608
imagining that it would be hard. I can't imagine, 
you know, doing that. But I think since I was had

02:46.402 --> 02:54.980
been in the field and had been a professional for a 
while and had a little more experience, that was a

02:46.402 --> 02:54.980
lot easier in terms of organization, but it's not 
easy. No, it's not. I mean, you have to really

02:56.123 --> 02:58.067
organize your time. And what is your definition of 
a liberated woman?

03:06.736 --> 03:09.320
It means a lot of different things to a lot of 
different people. Sometimes people use it

03:10.782 --> 03:12.724
derogatorily. When they say a woman liber, 
usually if you use the word liber, that's more of a

03:12.764 --> 03:21.116
derogatory kind of term.

03:22.037 --> 03:30.168
And so some people think that it's a person who is 
feminist in that they attack men and so forth.

03:30.228 --> 03:32.051
Well, I don't think that that's at all what it is. A 
real feminist is a person who thinks about the

03:33.972 --> 03:36.495
issues in terms of gender roles. I mean, that's 
what I would think. So it's hard to say, when people

03:38.157 --> 03:43.043
say, are you a feminist, you never know really what 
that means. So if you're talking about what I think

03:43.143 --> 03:59.743
a feminist is, I think it's a person who is 
concerned with the issues about gender roles in

03:43.143 --> 03:59.743
our society, who thinks about them, who is 
concerned for the liberation of, liberation in

03:43.143 --> 03:59.743
the sense of freedom for both men and women in terms 
of rigid sex roles. Now was your question, do I

04:04.513 --> 04:07.579
consider myself a feminist? Well, that's the next 
question. Do you feel that you are a liberated

04:09.563 --> 04:13.711
woman? Well, like I said, the word liberated woman 
can mean a lot of different things. I feel like I

04:20.564 --> 04:25.972
believe that there should be less rigid gender 
roles, something we talked about, you know, I just

04:20.564 --> 04:25.972
mentioned. I think that society, in terms of the 
economic structure particularly, doesn't allow

04:26.152 --> 04:40.734
that to happen as much because, for example, we 
don't see men having the same kind of rights with

04:26.152 --> 04:40.734
children as women are given sometimes. And the 
opposite view is women are still discriminated

04:40.834 --> 04:48.566
against in terms of child care kinds of 
facilities. So I think that society forces that

04:50.450 --> 04:55.018
kind of rigidity in terms of gender roles. I mean, 
there's something individuals can do about it,

04:55.479 --> 04:58.063
obviously. I mean, since I'm a social 
psychologist, I believe that. But I think that

05:00.968 --> 05:05.476
we're nowhere near getting to a really flexible 
society. You can see, look around and see

05:05.536 --> 05:15.073
societies that are really more flexible than ours 
in terms of the kinds of arrangements that are made

05:05.536 --> 05:15.073
for couples to take care of their children. And I 
don't think the United States has gotten to that.

05:18.428 --> 05:19.530
And sometimes it scares me. I think we're going 
backwards rather than forwards in some of those

05:19.550 --> 05:24.979
kinds of issues. But I think academia is one place 
where you really can achieve a little more freedom

05:24.999 --> 05:31.290
in terms of those rigidity of roles because you 
have a lot more freedom over your time. So that's

05:35.496 --> 05:37.438
one thing that's really helped us. I mean, my 
family, my husband, and my child and I because, for

05:37.498 --> 05:50.976
example, today, Friday, Phillip stays home and 
then I come in and then I, you know, we take turns

05:37.498 --> 05:50.976
some days and then three days she's with a sitter. 
And that kind of flexibility is wonderful because

05:50.996 --> 06:00.349
it allows sort of everybody at least some kinds of 
times away and then times there so we can sort of

06:00.650 --> 06:07.319
have more time with her than we would if we had to put 
her in, say, an institutional kind of child care

06:00.650 --> 06:07.319
facility. But not very many people have that kind 
of freedom. That's a real luxury. If you're

06:13.246 --> 06:15.089
outside of academia, you don't have that. So we're 
really lucky in that respect. And I know that most

06:17.191 --> 06:22.098
people don't have that kind of freedom. And that's 
what I think is bad in terms of family development

06:22.458 --> 06:30.268
and freedom and feminism, all those kinds of 
issues. Moving away from the family and kind of

06:31.042 --> 06:43.039
into your work, do you feel that you had to work 
harder to get where you are today than your husband

06:31.042 --> 06:43.039
or other male colleagues because you're women?

06:45.903 --> 06:46.965
Well, that's a hard question. Maybe in some ways, 
yes, and in some ways, no. I think that there's a

06:50.911 --> 06:56.779
basic socialization process that women 
sometimes have to overcome. Not all women, of

06:59.898 --> 07:08.757
course, but many women, because a lot of us are 
socialized to think in terms of family

06:59.898 --> 07:08.757
orientation period. And I come from a fairly 
traditional kind of household. And my parents

07:13.286 --> 07:18.497
were not all that eager to see me continue in my 
education. and go so long without a family. In

07:21.524 --> 07:24.531
fact, they sort of gave up hope about a family. So I 
mean, there's that initial socialization that's

07:24.571 --> 07:32.993
very hard to overcome and I think stays with us a 
lot, a lot of women. You know, why am I doing this any

07:33.918 --> 07:36.301
time? And sometimes when it gets tough, when the 
going gets tough, you think, gosh, if I, you know,

07:36.341 --> 07:44.293
maybe my parents were right, maybe I should just 
give this all up and stay home. Or sometimes when

07:44.393 --> 07:48.999
you feel guilty about not spending enough time at 
home, you think about those kinds of things. So

07:49.580 --> 07:51.823
there's that initial socialization. Once I, 
professionally, however,

07:59.180 --> 08:06.411
There are sometimes problems in terms of 
acceptance initially, and I think that that's

07:59.180 --> 08:06.411
tougher on women than it is on men. So when you first 
meet people, for example, there is this kind of

08:07.112 --> 08:16.907
idea that you do really have to overcome, in some 
sense, being a woman to show that you're

08:07.112 --> 08:16.907
professional. Of course, that's a horrible 
thought. It doesn't happen with women, among

08:19.110 --> 08:24.478
women, by the way, but it does sometimes when 
you're with men. Now I notice that less now, and

08:24.897 --> 08:40.503
maybe that's because I've become a little more 
established in the discipline, but I noticed it a

08:24.897 --> 08:40.503
lot initially when I was very young, where you had 
to sort of overcome both the stereotype of being

08:24.897 --> 08:40.503
young and a woman. And so that was sometimes a 
problem.

08:48.117 --> 08:53.764
Do you feel that you received less encouragement 
for your achievements because you are a woman? You

08:55.145 --> 09:00.071
were talking about your parents and things like 
that and being socialized. As you were going

09:00.651 --> 09:12.045
through school or when you first became a 
professor and first started working, did you feel

09:00.651 --> 09:12.045
that your colleagues did not encourage you or your 
family did not encourage you? Well, my family. was

09:16.062 --> 09:25.056
always emotionally encouraging, but it was sort 
of not

09:16.062 --> 09:25.056
really encouraging professionally, but always 
emotionally encouraging. It just was sort of

09:25.096 --> 09:28.321
like, well, why do you need to do that kind of 
attitude? So there was that. I don't feel that

09:29.683 --> 09:38.016
professionally, especially in this department, 
I don't feel like I was discouraged at all. I didn't

09:38.037 --> 09:38.998
feel that at all. And in graduate school, I had a 
wonderful experience with a professor there who

09:39.198 --> 09:48.411
gave me a lot of his time and was very encouraging to 
me personally. Now, there are always

09:49.392 --> 09:59.145
problems, or there are sometimes problems with 
that when you become very close with a professor

09:49.392 --> 09:59.145
and the professor is a male and you're a female. 
Sometimes there are a lot of innuendos that go

09:59.526 --> 10:02.710
along with that. But in this case, there wasn't so 
much of that just because this character was so

10:03.471 --> 10:07.737
kind of, different that no one would have thought 
about that kind of relationship. Have you ever had

10:13.596 --> 10:23.377
any other problems with sex roles or men coming on 
to you or whatever because you're a woman working?

10:24.139 --> 10:25.101
Has that been a problem? Sure, I mean, sure, you 
have that kind of thing happen, but I don't know

10:27.241 --> 10:37.232
whether that's a problem because of the status of 
being in a position. I think that's a problem that

10:37.292 --> 10:39.814
all women have to deal with. You know, it's an 
irritation, and it can be sometimes very

10:40.836 --> 10:50.146
frustrating that that happens, that people see 
you that way instead of professionally when

10:40.836 --> 10:50.146
you're expecting to be seen one way. But I think 
that happens to all women regardless of position.

10:55.912 --> 10:57.113
And that's the thing that women... have to 
confront, I think. Did you ever feel that male

11:01.285 --> 11:20.299
colleagues avoid you or feel that what you have to 
say is unimportant or that what you're doing as far

11:01.285 --> 11:20.299
as research or your teaching is just not important 
because you're a woman or that you don't quite

11:01.285 --> 11:20.299
know, you don't quite have the knowledge that they 
do?

11:23.384 --> 11:24.625
I don't really think so. I haven't felt that. And as 
I mentioned before, I think sometimes initially

11:25.847 --> 11:30.733
that happens. But my feeling here is, and of course 
that may be because I wanted to feel that way, but my

11:31.734 --> 11:40.204
feeling here is no, that that's not what has 
happened. Now, I have sort of a minority view in

11:40.224 --> 11:49.155
sociology because I'm an experimental social 
psychologist and that's fairly rare. And so

11:49.855 --> 11:51.197
sometimes I won't get kidded about that as a 
minority opinion, but I don't think that has

11:51.717 --> 11:58.163
anything to do with my gender. And I've never felt, 
at least after an initial, very initial stage,

11:58.823 --> 12:10.394
I've never felt that they've taken me less 
seriously.

12:11.975 --> 12:16.980
What have been some of the problems in your private 
life due to your career or with your family? Have

12:17.320 --> 12:19.142
you felt that there's been anything?

12:22.025 --> 12:51.745
well first let me say I think for the most part it's 
been just the opposite that because I'm so happy in

12:22.025 --> 12:51.745
terms of what I do because it's such a joy to me that 
that only is good things for my quote private life

12:22.025 --> 12:51.745
and actually it turns out that it's almost 
inseparable you don't really talk about your

12:22.025 --> 12:51.745
professional versus your private life it seems 
very much intertwined to me so that for the most

12:22.025 --> 12:51.745
part it's only been good because I'm so happy with 
what I'm doing in terms of time I mean there's

12:22.025 --> 12:51.745
always the problem in terms of time and you have to 
prioritize what you're going to do, and as I

12:52.096 --> 13:19.774
mentioned before, I think you have to be fairly 
well organized, so for example, we're lucky, I

12:52.096 --> 13:19.774
think we're lucky in that our little girl goes to 
bed at 7.30, which is early, and so that leaves time

12:52.096 --> 13:19.774
later on to work, and so we even, you know, we switch 
around times, who's going to stay home, or who goes

12:52.096 --> 13:19.774
in, or if we spend time together, so it's led to more 
planning in terms of organization, but You know,

13:20.733 --> 13:22.916
and there's that kind of a dilemma maybe. And since 
this is not just a full-time job, it's really more

13:22.997 --> 13:31.089
than a full-time job, it's led to pressures in 
terms of time. And sometimes it gets to be pretty

13:31.130 --> 13:33.333
overwhelming. Sometimes in the middle of 
cleaning the house when you should be grading

13:33.413 --> 13:44.631
tests, or in the middle of grading tests when you 
should be cleaning the house, it sometimes, you

13:33.413 --> 13:44.631
know, gets pretty overwhelming. I think, again, I 
think that's probably a real common problem, and

13:44.965 --> 13:57.705
for the most part, it's been good that I'm so happy 
professionally, that I really enjoy what I do,

13:44.965 --> 13:57.705
because I think if I didn't, it would be tougher on 
my family. I think it would carry on. Does your

13:59.428 --> 14:03.955
husband really encourage you in your work and in 
your research? I mean, does it help with him being a

14:03.975 --> 14:06.740
professor and understanding? Yeah, I think it 
definitely helps, yeah. It would be, he's very

14:08.262 --> 14:10.686
encouraging. to me, and I'm encouraging to him. 
And that's what makes, I think, a good

14:13.772 --> 14:16.496
relationship. It would be, I can't even imagine, I 
think it would be very difficult, if not

14:16.536 --> 14:24.690
impossible, if you had someone who was not at all 
encouraging about what you wanted to do. But

14:25.852 --> 14:35.408
again, I think that's because both of us realize 
that that part of our lives is so important, and

14:25.852 --> 14:35.408
we're so happy with the kinds of things that we do.

14:37.717 --> 14:42.043
Do you feel that you've ever had a problem getting 
things published because you're a woman?

14:46.610 --> 14:51.116
Well, I think I've had problems getting things 
published, but I don't think it's because I'm a

14:46.610 --> 14:51.116
woman, no. In fact, I don't think that...

14:55.142 --> 14:59.908
I can honestly say I don't think that's ever made a 
difference. Okay, good. What times in your life

15:00.269 --> 15:03.614
have you felt discrimination? Have there been 
times when you felt you've been discriminated

15:03.774 --> 15:06.778
against?

15:10.268 --> 15:23.621
Well, as I mentioned earlier, I think still, 
initially, there are problems in terms of when you

15:10.268 --> 15:23.621
first meet people, sometimes professionally, in 
terms of them taking you, quote, seriously, if

15:10.268 --> 15:23.621
you're a woman. Although in our discipline, 
that's less. And in our department, by the way,

15:25.523 --> 15:31.069
because we have so many women, I think that that's 
become much less of a factor. In the University of

15:32.170 --> 15:36.314
Hull, of course, there are a lot less women 
overall. And so I imagine the less women they are,

15:36.875 --> 15:40.258
the more different they are and therefore the more 
the heavier the stereotypes probably are. So I'm

15:45.275 --> 15:52.223
sure it's a problem elsewhere.

15:52.584 --> 15:57.509
And the things that all women encounter, I think, 
in terms of discrimination. When you go to a store,

15:58.330 --> 16:02.455
for example, and people ask you for your husband's 
name versus your name. Those kinds of issues, I

16:02.655 --> 16:04.857
think, that all women have. Other than that, as far 
as special, kinds of issues that I would face that

16:08.335 --> 16:12.892
maybe other people in different positions 
wouldn't. I don't really think so, except, as I

16:13.614 --> 16:17.569
mentioned, that initial kind of you know, meeting 
with someone or initial interactions. Do you feel

16:21.596 --> 16:32.969
that this people's response to you initially when 
they first meet you, before they get to know you, do

16:21.596 --> 16:32.969
you think it's because it's initially or because 
you're a woman? Like, do you feel like men have the

16:32.989 --> 16:40.937
same problem that when they first enter a new, you 
know, workforce, whatever, they have to overcome

16:32.989 --> 16:40.937
this? No, of course, both of those factors are 
important. Just being new, for example. But I'm

16:44.741 --> 16:48.045
talking about something a little more insidious, 
more... social-psychological. We know that when

16:50.189 --> 16:53.454
you first meet someone, you don't have any 
information about them. And so what happens is

16:53.494 --> 17:00.705
that what we call diffuse status characteristics 
are the first things you notice. Like, of course we

17:00.725 --> 17:03.630
first notice whether they're male or female. And 
the question is, how much does that organize the

17:04.131 --> 17:07.135
interaction? And I think that in our society 
still, that organizes the interaction to a great

17:07.656 --> 17:11.622
deal. And not all of that, of course, is something 
we want to get rid of, but some of it is, I think. And

17:16.149 --> 17:17.391
what I'm saying is that when you meet somebody 
first, and I'm not just talking about first

17:17.860 --> 17:46.645
interactions, I'm even saying over a period of a 
couple weeks or so, that that seems to have an

17:17.860 --> 17:46.645
overwhelming effect, so that what you get sort of, 
you know that this is happening, and so you have

17:17.860 --> 17:46.645
sort of the idea, yes, I have to be especially good 
at this, or especially eloquent, or especially

17:17.860 --> 17:46.645
something to overcome that initial stereotype 
that, oh, well, she's, quote, just a woman. Okay.

17:48.185 --> 17:59.340
In the 50s, women were viewed as stereotyped as 
being intuitive, emotional, independent, while

17:48.185 --> 17:59.340
men were viewed as intelligent and independent 
and rational. How do you feel about this? Has this

18:02.925 --> 18:05.328
changed over the past few years? Do you feel women 
are still viewed as emotional? That's almost an

18:10.294 --> 18:17.584
empirical question, and there have been studies 
on that which demonstrate that, in fact, yeah,

18:10.294 --> 18:17.584
those stereotypes still do exist. In some areas 
they've weakened, but in some areas they haven't

18:17.935 --> 18:21.719
weakened at all. I mean, in some of those 
stereotypes. So, yeah, the recent studies all

18:23.702 --> 18:40.281
indicate that as far as power, influence, and all 
of those variables that we've talked about in

18:23.702 --> 18:40.281
terms of social psychology, that, yeah, gender is 
still a very important characteristic and still

18:23.702 --> 18:40.281
organizes interaction. Have your achievements 
made you feel less feminine or less desirable as a

18:41.307 --> 18:46.054
woman? Do you feel that because you're a professor 
in this high status role or whatever, that that's

18:46.635 --> 18:55.607
made you less of a woman? Not at all.

18:59.553 --> 19:03.699
Women tend to hold lower expectations of what they 
can do and accomplish. Why do you feel this occurs?

19:10.214 --> 19:18.644
Did you ever have feelings that because you're a 
woman you had to work harder and you might not be

19:10.214 --> 19:18.644
able to accomplish what is set for you? Well, this 
gets to some of the social psychology literature

19:18.964 --> 19:28.395
on the subject about expectations and 
self-expectations versus other expectations.

19:29.236 --> 19:34.923
And we know that through interaction that you can 
develop, of course, expectations for yourself.

19:34.943 --> 19:39.208
That's the old self-fulfilling prophecy and 
labeling and all that kind of stuff. and that

19:39.577 --> 20:02.074
suggests that very early socialization is 
especially important so your parents if your

19:39.577 --> 20:02.074
parents hold very traditional views or that women 
can't do this or should do this or whatever then

19:39.577 --> 20:02.074
you're more likely to respond to those kinds of 
labels and if teachers and peers and so forth have

19:39.577 --> 20:02.074
that same kind of labeling process you're likely 
to respond to it so i think Yeah, I think a lot of

20:02.442 --> 20:05.005
women are subject to that. Still, as much as we say, 
well, things are changing, they may be changing,

20:05.446 --> 20:15.718
but I don't think they're changing all that 
rapidly in terms of the kind of curriculum and

20:05.446 --> 20:15.718
stuff that are offered in schools. And a lot of it 
depends on individual teachers, of course. So

20:18.662 --> 20:26.972
that early socialization is very important in 
terms of shaping what you expect that you can do and

20:18.662 --> 20:26.972
what you can do. So we have, again, lots of studies 
that seem to indicate, yes, women or men, or in

20:32.243 --> 20:40.538
terms of race and ethnicity and so forth, that a lot 
of things are shaped very early on, and sometimes

20:32.243 --> 20:40.538
those are hard to change. Now, what was the second 
part of the question? Did you ever feel these

20:44.525 --> 20:56.125
feelings, or have you ever felt that you couldn't 
accomplish certain things, that you had to work

20:44.525 --> 20:56.125
harder to accomplish these things because you 
were a woman?

21:00.172 --> 21:05.982
I think the insidious part of labeling is that you 
don't think it's because you're a woman

21:00.172 --> 21:05.982
necessarily. Well, you might do that, but you may 
think it's because it's you, whatever you, you

21:06.362 --> 21:10.850
know, is. So I think a lot of women have the idea, 
well, I can't do this as well as other people, and

21:10.870 --> 21:22.149
the other people may be mainly men in that case. So, 
yeah, I can, I mean, I remember feeling that, in

21:26.767 --> 21:33.093
elementary school, in junior high, high school, 
all of that, really through college. When I was an

21:34.154 --> 21:38.379
undergraduate, I initially chose a very 
traditional kind of career. I was in secondary

21:38.419 --> 21:40.040
education. And I felt a lot of that. I mean, I 
remember thinking, well, what's a good career for

21:43.083 --> 21:46.527
a woman? I remember going through a lot of that. And 
I was backed up by my family. And I can't really

21:50.271 --> 21:54.495
pinpoint what exactly changed that. except that, 
you know, achieving some sort of success in other

21:55.015 --> 22:00.381
kinds of areas, you know, in college. College was 
an exciting experience for me because, you know, I

22:00.441 --> 22:08.489
just learned so many really different things that 
I hadn't learned before. So I think, yeah, the

22:09.130 --> 22:21.023
process itself is hard to pinpoint because it's so 
diffuse, but I think a lot of people experienced

22:09.130 --> 22:21.023
it, especially women, but not just women. I think 
in terms of ethnicity and race, you'll find those

22:24.682 --> 22:28.749
kinds of things happen too, and individuals too in 
terms of personality. Have you ever felt isolated

22:29.390 --> 22:32.354
because you were a woman?

22:36.501 --> 22:49.322
I think sometimes when there are not other women 
around and you'd really like to talk to another

22:36.501 --> 22:49.322
woman just because you'd like to, because you feel 
like you want to talk to someone like that, yeah,

22:36.501 --> 22:49.322
you can feel very isolated. And that's why I think 
we're lucky in this department that we have women

22:49.724 --> 22:54.310
that we can talk to about this. Or sometimes, of 
course, if you have just good friends, even if

22:54.490 --> 23:02.700
they're male, even you can do that. But I remember, 
especially when I first came here, feeling very

23:02.760 --> 23:09.528
isolated in terms of just wanting to talk to 
somebody. So I think having other women around,

23:09.548 --> 23:17.638
not in maybe any organized fashion, but someone to 
talk to and bounce ideas off of is very important.

23:20.133 --> 23:27.624
How

23:20.133 --> 23:27.624
have you found that men and women are evaluated? Do 
you feel that, say in this department, men and

23:28.125 --> 23:32.652
women are evaluated equally?

23:39.141 --> 23:46.512
I think that in terms of performance and so forth, I 
think that they are. may sound sort of

23:48.128 --> 23:51.783
Pollyannaish, but I think that they really are. 
Now there are some, there is sexism here because I

23:58.000 --> 24:10.036
think we have people who went through the same 
socialization system that a lot of us did, so that

23:58.000 --> 24:10.036
there are, of course, you know, some ideas about, 
well, the little lady, you know, that kind of

23:58.000 --> 24:10.036
stuff. But I think when it comes down to it, when it 
comes down to evaluating performance, I think

24:10.056 --> 24:21.672
that it really is done fairly, fairly, fairly 
fairly.

24:21.692 --> 24:26.578
Women seem to be more competitive with each other 
than with men. Do you... Do you feel this, that

24:28.544 --> 24:33.875
you're more competitive with the women in this 
department than with the men? No, I think that's a

24:34.557 --> 24:36.000
myth. You think it's a myth? I mean, there have been 
some ideas about that. There's an old concept

24:41.070 --> 24:49.067
called the Queen Bee Syndrome, and the Queen Bee 
Syndrome was the idea that once a woman made it,

24:49.418 --> 24:58.408
that she sort of looked down on other women, sort of 
the idea that, well, I made it, and I worked really

24:49.418 --> 24:58.408
hard, and you guys are just, you know, you do it on 
your own if you want to. I'm sure not going to help

24:58.448 --> 24:59.530
you. And for a while, that was sort of popularized, 
I think, in the literature. But they haven't been

25:03.194 --> 25:07.339
able really to find much evidence of that since 
then. At least that's my understanding. You could

25:08.820 --> 25:10.502
check with Liz. She might know something about 
that. But I don't feel that at all. I've never felt

25:14.367 --> 25:17.130
that, I don't think. When you arrived at A&M, when 
you first started working here, not as a graduate

25:17.532 --> 25:28.645
student, what women's organizations were on 
campus? Do you remember?

25:33.010 --> 25:38.216
On campus, there was the University Women's 
Organizational Group. I'm not sure of the full

25:38.236 --> 25:40.639
title. And I attended a meeting of theirs a long 
time ago. and just was not really interested too

25:46.034 --> 25:49.138
much. I mean, it wasn't that I didn't find what they 
were doing so interesting, but quite frankly, I

25:49.218 --> 25:54.565
was so busy then. I mean, literally all my time was 
spent just working and teaching and doing all that

25:54.645 --> 26:01.513
kind of stuff, so I didn't get involved as much. I 
think now there are more groups and more support

26:01.954 --> 26:05.599
groups, and I think that's really good. Are you a 
member of any women's organizations?

26:14.941 --> 26:17.545
None that are solely for women, no. Okay, because, 
like, have you ever been a member of NOW? Yes. But

26:24.435 --> 26:25.818
that's not solely for women. But it's a women 
organization. Right, I mean, but I thought you

26:30.364 --> 26:33.870
meant like a support group for women. No, I was a 
member of NOW. I'm a member of NARAL, which is

26:38.397 --> 26:40.560
the... I won't be able to remember, but it's for 
pro-choice kinds of issues, which is not, again,

26:42.008 --> 26:49.777
not just a women's group. I'm also a member of ACLU, 
which is both, and a member of

26:49.797 --> 27:08.419
Amnesty International and a couple other groups 
of similar kind of nature, but they're, yeah.

27:08.439 --> 27:08.539
Okay. What types of changes do you feel that have 
occurred in favor of women at A&M since you've been

27:10.628 --> 27:17.997
here? Or what changes that haven't occurred would 
you like to see occur? I think the most important

27:23.624 --> 27:28.410
thing is that more women be hired. And that's been a 
change in this department. When I came here, there

27:30.993 --> 27:32.215
were three of us i think and now we have seven women 
on the faculty so that's been a big change and since

27:32.718 --> 27:54.017
i was involved in the recruiting i know it didn't 
have anything to do with trying to recruit women it

27:32.718 --> 27:54.017
was just of course who the best candidates were and 
i think that's what will happen i mean i think more

27:32.718 --> 27:54.017
and more women will come here but um i think a m still 
has a very conservative image And when talking

27:54.352 --> 28:01.124
about encouraging women to come here, sometimes 
you have to think about what kind of support

27:54.352 --> 28:01.124
they're going to get when they do come here. For 
example, there are only nine female full

28:01.144 --> 28:08.657
professors at this whole university, and our 
department has two of them. So when you think about

28:09.839 --> 28:18.013
going over, let's say, to the Ag school, where 
there probably are none, I'm not for sure, but

28:09.839 --> 28:18.013
there are very few women I think there are a couple 
women, but I don't think there are any focal

28:18.500 --> 28:25.933
places, then you have to consider what kind of 
atmosphere they're going to be faced with. And I

28:26.013 --> 28:38.154
think generally that's an important issue, 
because I think some areas are more subject to the

28:26.013 --> 28:38.154
kinds of stereotypes we talked about and the kind 
of discrimination than are other areas. So that's

28:38.735 --> 28:42.381
the most important thing, I think, to get more 
women here. And I've seen that's been one change in

28:43.897 --> 28:46.841
this department anyway. I'm not so sure about 
overall, although other departments in liberal

28:46.861 --> 28:54.090
arts, I think there are more women. More women are 
getting into the administration. I'm saying

28:56.774 --> 28:58.837
that's an important issue, I think. So, for 
example, one of the associate deans in liberal

28:58.857 --> 29:08.009
arts is a woman, and Grace Chisholm in the 
president's office is a woman. And so that's been

29:08.029 --> 29:12.655
important, and that I see more in a growing 
awareness of the issue. I think that A&M, quite

29:13.090 --> 29:26.732
frankly, is way behind the times if we just look at 
the issues about the recognition of gay rights and

29:13.090 --> 29:26.732
the women in the band and issues like that, which 
seem almost Neanderthal when you look at it. I

29:27.032 --> 29:32.360
don't think, however, those issues are 
necessarily reflective of the students'

29:27.032 --> 29:32.360
attitudes. What I seem to pick up on growing 
acceptance, or maybe I just wish to pick it up, but I

29:32.441 --> 29:40.954
think a growing acceptance of women in terms of... 
integration into society in general. And I think a

29:45.283 --> 29:51.209
lot of that is because we have a lot more women and 
the women themselves are important in that

29:45.283 --> 29:51.209
respect. Earlier you talked about our being 
socialized as a woman and our parents having the

29:52.751 --> 30:03.383
traditional roles. Do you feel that there's any 
way that this can change or is changing or families

30:10.330 --> 30:19.323
today, parents, they're still socializing their 
children with those roles of being male, being

30:10.330 --> 30:19.323
female. I think it is changing. I think that you can 
see evidence of that, for example, in mass media.

30:25.172 --> 30:29.058
Shows like Sesame Street, for example, I think are 
a good illustration of that. Although you see some

30:29.959 --> 30:33.344
vestiges, of course, of that. So in Sesame Street, 
which I think is a fairly good illustration

30:33.364 --> 30:39.814
because so many kids watch it, you have in there 
female characters who are mechanics or fix-it

30:40.216 --> 30:50.651
shops and things like that, so that you do see some 
movement away from the traditional

30:40.216 --> 30:50.651
stereotyping. Although you can still notice, 
even in Sesame Street, which is supposed to be sort

30:51.312 --> 31:01.527
of a bastion of liberality for children, that, for 
example, the puppets, the characters, are almost

30:51.312 --> 31:01.527
entirely male. So, I mean, I think things are 
changing. I'm just not sure how fast they're

31:04.331 --> 31:06.073
changing. And you see differences in... in 
curriculum attention paid to those kinds of

31:07.688 --> 31:12.715
issues and so forth. Now, I'm talking about mostly 
public kinds of education. Of course, there are

31:18.182 --> 31:31.139
growing interest in religious kinds of 
education, some of which may stress sexual

31:18.182 --> 31:31.139
equality and some of which do not at all and 
emphasize traditional. So I don't know. I think

31:32.641 --> 31:36.987
overall, there's a growing awareness of those 
kinds of issues. in terms of socialization. So I

31:38.812 --> 31:43.856
think it is changing, maybe in general, although 
there are these pockets. And as I said, I mean, I

31:45.938 --> 31:49.041
suppose we could do some studies on that. Maybe 
it's just because I wish that that's what was

31:49.061 --> 31:52.544
happening. Do you think it'll help with more women 
getting into the workforce and their children

31:53.204 --> 32:04.694
seeing their mother and their father working and 
that they will be more socialized to equality?

32:04.714 --> 32:05.535
They both can work. Mom's not staying at home. 
Sure, although if you look at the studies, and Liz

32:08.894 --> 32:22.749
will talk about this, and sure, if you look at the 
studies, it is still the case that the people who do

32:08.894 --> 32:22.749
the cleaning at the house and do those other things 
are the women, regardless of whether they work or

32:08.894 --> 32:22.749
not. So we still have some of the, sort of like the 
worst of both worlds. You go and you work, and then

32:26.913 --> 32:35.042
you come home and you're expected by whoever to 
cook and clean and take care of the kids. Women

32:35.623 --> 32:37.905
still spend most time with the children probably, 
most time cleaning the house, most time cooking,

32:37.970 --> 32:42.554
and most time doing the shopping. So yeah, I think 
that may change, maybe, the stereotypes. But we

32:47.559 --> 32:54.826
might see them replaced by a whole new series of 
stereotypes that were maybe just as detrimental

32:47.559 --> 32:54.826
in some ways. Do you feel it is more stressful on 
women to have a job and a family?

33:02.613 --> 33:05.496
I think it's stressful in one way, in terms of time. 
But I think in another way, It helps deal with

33:08.345 --> 33:10.307
stress. I mean, I think that if you, you know, I was 
talking about that before, if you're not forced

33:10.407 --> 33:26.266
into the job market, that's a different issue than 
being forced in where you, let's say you're the

33:10.407 --> 33:26.266
sole provider and there are lots of families like 
that, and so you have to make money and you have to

33:10.407 --> 33:26.266
take care of everything else. That's a very 
stressful situation. And now, if you're not

33:28.909 --> 33:36.478
forced into that situation where you are working, 
let's say, to supplement the income, and you have

33:36.695 --> 33:44.104
the family, then I think that the stress will sort 
of relieve itself in some ways, although time is

33:36.695 --> 33:44.104
always very stressful. But for a lot of women, the 
choice is not there. They have to work. They have to

33:48.830 --> 33:51.894
maintain the family. Okay. Well, I have no further 
questions. Is there anything that you would like

33:53.976 --> 33:59.303
to add or something that you would like to say that I 
have not?

34:03.167 --> 34:03.508
I don't think so. Well, thank you for your time. 
Okay.

34:09.432 --> 34:11.855
One other question. Why did you marry? Because 
some people think that marriage is a form of

34:13.478 --> 34:17.603
servitude.

34:23.571 --> 34:31.322
Well, I don't consider my marriage a form of 
servitude, although a lot of, and some

34:23.571 --> 34:31.322
feminists... literature marriage is considered 
at least traditional marriage is considered to be

34:31.792 --> 35:01.258
a form of servitude because originally of course 
if you look at it historically women were

34:31.792 --> 35:01.258
considered erotic property and so that was the 
whole the whole phenomenon of marriage was sort of

34:31.792 --> 35:01.258
built up around that idea of property women as 
property and so I think it used to be yes a form of

34:31.792 --> 35:01.258
servitude and many times now I think it's a form of 
servitude but I don't think personally my own

34:31.792 --> 35:01.258
marriage is a form of servitude I think it's you 
know frankly I think living together and getting

35:01.660 --> 35:05.044
married, there's not much difference between 
that. It's just that we enjoy each other and we want

35:05.084 --> 35:09.050
to build our futures together. And of course, 
since we have a child, that was important. But I

35:13.155 --> 35:17.781
think the child was more of a commitment than a 
piece of paper that says that you're married. So in

35:18.462 --> 35:24.810
other words, I don't think being married really 
has anything to do with it. I think it's just the

35:24.970 --> 35:29.736
state of living together with someone and 
committing yourself to someone. OK. Did you

35:31.276 --> 35:37.004
accept your husband's name, or what name do you go 
by? I go by what's known as my maiden name. It's kind

35:41.851 --> 35:43.613
of a strange name. And I did that for a number of 
reasons. One is I was fairly old when I got married,

35:46.578 --> 35:52.526
and I'd had that name an awful long time, so I 
couldn't see changing it. I'd published under my

35:52.646 --> 35:54.769
name. before, and that's sometimes a problem for 
professional women if you change your name after

35:55.103 --> 36:01.537
you've published under one name. And it just 
didn't make sense to me to take my husband's name. I

36:08.071 --> 36:11.138
don't, you know, some people are very

36:13.970 --> 36:17.054
staunch about not taking someone's name or taking 
it. To me, I really don't see that it's all that

36:17.434 --> 36:21.218
important, quite frankly. The name that I have now 
is my father's name, and some people say, well,

36:22.760 --> 36:33.252
see, it's because of the way names are passed down, 
that that's wrong, too. And so some women have gone

36:33.293 --> 36:42.323
back and done other kinds of things, but the 
problem, of course, is going back to what name

36:33.293 --> 36:42.323
would be considered female type of name because if 
you say well take my grandmother's name of course

36:42.792 --> 37:07.230
that was your grandmother's father's name and all 
those kinds of issues so you know as far as

36:42.792 --> 37:07.230
tradition that's just the way the tradition has 
passed in our society I I think it becomes

36:42.792 --> 37:07.230
problematic when you have children and then you 
decide what you're going to name them and the

36:42.792 --> 37:07.230
tradition is still to name them after the husband 
usually or the father In our case, by the way, we

37:08.071 --> 37:12.736
couldn't decide what to do, and our little girl has 
my name. That was just sort of a choice that we

37:13.297 --> 37:17.262
decided at the last moment. But, I mean, that 
becomes a dilemma. Some people have chosen

37:19.024 --> 37:23.108
hyphenated names, which is a nice kind of solution 
to that. But I think that becomes a practical

37:23.549 --> 37:31.358
problem because then when your child grows up and 
then marries, you have to decide which names

37:23.549 --> 37:31.358
you're going to drop and so forth. So, I mean, it's a 
big sort of an issue. I think practically it's sort

37:33.901 --> 37:35.783
of a problem I think in terms of how you think about 
it, I think you should do what you find most

37:36.117 --> 37:47.017
comfortable, and that's what I found most 
comfortable, because my identity was as Jane

37:36.117 --> 37:47.017
Saul. Does your husband support you on these 
feelings, or was he really wanting you to take his

37:47.999 --> 37:58.058
name, or did he understand about your publishing 
and your... Well, I felt pretty strong about it. I

37:59.747 --> 38:04.308
don't think he felt very strongly about it one way 
or the other. Well, thank you.
