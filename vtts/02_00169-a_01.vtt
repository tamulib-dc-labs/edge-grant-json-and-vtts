WEBVTT

00:02.393 --> 00:04.091
One, two, three, four.

00:05.061 --> 00:06.092
One, two, three, four.

00:08.300 --> 00:17.874
You came back from work, would it be, did y'all call it out in the field if you were assigned statewide?

00:18.115 --> 00:22.561
Oh, I think you just called it in the county, working in the county, at the county level.

00:22.822 --> 00:26.667
You'd been working at the county level and you got back to here to the state level.

00:26.727 --> 00:26.968
Right.

00:26.988 --> 00:34.178
I came in in 1955 after having served about three or four years.

00:34.759 --> 00:36.602
Well, part of that I was in graduate school.

00:36.582 --> 00:40.188
three or four years as an agent at the county level.

00:41.230 --> 00:54.353
And I was brought in specifically, I think we mentioned that before, maybe overlap, to try to develop this formula for seeing how many agents each county should have and how much each county should contribute and this type of thing.

00:54.413 --> 00:59.181
And that's because I had my master's research at Michigan State

00:59.600 --> 01:11.653
delved into this area but hadn't, you know, just developed it from Michigan and they wanted it applied and the Michigan only did what we called measured workload but not financing.

01:12.534 --> 01:23.346
But in Texas they wanted both to measure workload and this was in the heyday of the Gilmer Aiken days of some way of having a more rational way of sharing the cost with the counties where

01:23.326 --> 01:30.017
the so-called poor counties would not be expected to contribute quite as much as the, quote, richer counties.

01:31.099 --> 01:38.030
In that era, what were then called the home demonstration agents and the county agents.

01:38.471 --> 01:43.299
Typically your staff was, I guess the average staff in Texas was about three.

01:43.379 --> 01:45.823
It has maintained that pretty much, but that varies

01:46.327 --> 01:50.293
You have a lot of them that have just one, and usually it's an agricultural agent.

01:51.155 --> 01:56.363
If you have a second one, it'll be what they call home demonstration, then later home economics, and they call them family resource.

01:56.403 --> 01:57.905
Now they've changed the name several times.

01:57.925 --> 01:59.307
That usually is the second person.

01:59.848 --> 02:06.960
Third person would probably be an agricultural person, called assistant in those days, who would primarily work with the youth.

02:07.040 --> 02:10.585
If a fourth person came in, it'd probably be a female home economics.

02:11.146 --> 02:13.009
The staffs I worked on in Wharton,

02:13.276 --> 02:16.922
And in Matagorda County, we're that way.

02:16.982 --> 02:20.668
They had four white agents, if I may use that term.

02:21.289 --> 02:23.533
And there were two black agents, but we had separate offices.

02:24.414 --> 02:29.142
And the two younger agents, assistant agents, primarily carried on the youth program.

02:29.780 --> 02:31.203
But they were usually housed together.

02:31.223 --> 02:34.670
I mean, the men were housed together and the women were all housed together.

02:35.673 --> 02:46.135
And that was the typical, but then some of your larger counties might have had additional assistant agents like Harris County, the largest county might have three or four additional assistants.

02:46.334 --> 02:51.980
Were there Hispanic agents carefully selected down near the Rio Grande Valley?

02:52.100 --> 02:53.422
There were a few, but very few.

02:53.622 --> 02:54.002
Oh, really?

02:54.262 --> 02:54.803
Yeah, very few.

02:55.183 --> 03:05.314
I guess primarily there were a few that had met the educational requirements because you had to have a, to work at the county level, you had to have a bachelor's degree in either agriculture or home economics.

03:05.494 --> 03:12.662
Back in the 50s, what would be your guesstimate of the percentage of those county agents that had gotten their undergraduate degree at A&M?

03:17.384 --> 03:29.944
Well, you know, one time I was challenged when I was director in the legislature by a West Texas legislator who said we only hired Aggies.

03:29.964 --> 03:38.357
And I guess there were certainly a predominance of Aggies hired in agriculture, but we didn't produce many home economics agencies.

03:38.377 --> 03:41.923
And I was able to tell him, I mean, he said, you don't hire anybody from tech.

03:42.106 --> 03:47.719
or from this area, and I was able to indicate in that something like 30, I had anticipated the question.

03:48.321 --> 03:53.292
And then the women made the difference because a lot of them came from tech and the home economics program.

03:53.333 --> 03:56.520
We had about 30 or 40 percent of our tech were about

03:57.361 --> 04:09.215
Thirty percent I think came out of Tech where about maybe 55 or 60 percent came out of A&M and then we also drew quite heavily on Oklahoma, particularly in both agriculture and home economics.

04:09.275 --> 04:16.484
I guess the pay situation, they, Oklahoma State had good programs but not enough jobs and a lot of them started working in Texas.

04:16.504 --> 04:20.989
Any from the old state teachers colleges in Texas?

04:20.969 --> 04:26.800
In the home economics field, very few, well, very few of the teachers' colleges had much of an agricultural program.

04:27.062 --> 04:27.705
What about A&R?

04:28.208 --> 04:29.690
A few, South Tech.

04:29.730 --> 04:30.611
I'm sure there were some.

04:30.631 --> 04:34.716
I mean, there were sprinklings of Texas Tech and agriculture.

04:35.457 --> 04:43.767
A&I and Sam Houston, they were, in fact, the agent I worked with in Wharton County was a Sam Houston graduate, had done his undergraduate work there.

04:44.128 --> 04:44.428
All right.

04:44.608 --> 04:45.770
When you got here in 55?

04:45.790 --> 04:46.350
55.

04:47.552 --> 04:54.300
Describe the administrative structure for the Agricultural Extension Service.

04:55.580 --> 05:06.349
Well, as we talked about, the extension service has been switched back and forth to system level, to university level, but at that time I think was considered part of the system

05:06.920 --> 05:09.685
And I guess we'd created a chancellor position by then.

05:09.705 --> 05:10.827
I don't know for sure.

05:10.847 --> 05:15.015
But there was a director and how many in the hierarchy?

05:15.997 --> 05:17.580
You mean in the Extension Service?

05:17.600 --> 05:18.141
Yeah.

05:18.161 --> 05:21.508
About how many were there at the administrative level?

05:21.528 --> 05:28.000
Administrative level there was a director, an associate director, and one or two assistant directors and state leaders.

05:27.980 --> 05:31.409
Administrative staff probably consisted of seven or eight people.

05:31.770 --> 05:34.657
And they were housed where?

05:35.940 --> 05:38.246
Originally in the Trigon.

05:38.266 --> 05:39.590
That was the extension building.

05:39.690 --> 05:40.572
In 55.

05:41.024 --> 05:41.745
Were they still there?

05:41.765 --> 05:46.089
They just, I think they had just, when I started work in 49, they were housed there.

05:46.109 --> 05:51.514
But I think somewhere in between there, they got housed where they are now in the Williams Building.

05:51.574 --> 05:55.457
What we then called the System Administration Building.

05:55.477 --> 05:58.881
Yeah, in the north side on the first floor and they're still, administrative staff is still there.

05:59.081 --> 06:02.404
When you got here in 55, where was your?

06:02.424 --> 06:05.687
In the Administration Building, but they had a hard time finding space for me.

06:06.528 --> 06:08.229
I just kind of, they found a corner for me.

06:08.269 --> 06:09.951
And the director then was who?

06:09.931 --> 06:14.239
The rector was Gibson, or G.G.

06:14.279 --> 06:14.640
Gibson.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.728
Describe him and his manner and style of leadership.

06:19.369 --> 06:22.916
Well, he was a highly respected individual.

06:23.096 --> 06:27.585
He was, did not have a doctorate degree.

06:28.072 --> 06:40.864
He was originally a Texan, I guess had done his undergraduate work at Texas A&M in the field of daring and then got a master's degree from Iowa State and then came back here as a dairy specialist.

06:40.884 --> 06:41.504
G.G.

06:41.604 --> 06:41.985
Gibson?

06:42.005 --> 06:42.205
G.G.

06:42.225 --> 06:42.605
Gibson.

06:42.825 --> 06:43.066
G.I.B.

06:43.086 --> 06:44.006
From Trinity, Texas.

06:44.107 --> 06:44.567
G.I.B.

06:44.587 --> 06:45.468
or G.I.P.?

06:45.488 --> 06:45.608
G.I.B.

06:45.888 --> 06:46.269
G.I.B.

06:46.489 --> 06:46.809
or G.I.P.

06:46.829 --> 06:49.351
He just recently passed away at 90-something years old.

06:51.393 --> 06:52.754
Describe him in personality.

06:53.335 --> 06:57.859
Well, he was an easygoing person.

07:00.218 --> 07:05.805
I mean, again, at the county level, you had very little interaction because the state's pretty big.

07:05.906 --> 07:08.389
You mostly interacted with your district supervisor.

07:09.070 --> 07:12.234
But, you know, he was well respected throughout the field.

07:12.334 --> 07:19.043
And, of course, I felt privileged that he selected me to come in as young as I was to work on this special project.

07:19.063 --> 07:23.509
Did he give you any guidance or advice as you began work with him?

07:23.489 --> 07:25.296
Well, very, not directly.

07:25.317 --> 07:27.847
I reported directly to the associate director.

07:27.887 --> 07:31.462
I actually had the title of just, I think at that time they didn't have an available title.

07:31.522 --> 07:33.972
I was promised the title of administrative assistant.

07:34.340 --> 07:41.169
but they had a fellow in that position who was about to retire and they didn't want to, you know, do that, and positions were limited.

07:41.489 --> 07:53.324
So they gave me the title, I think, County Agricultural Agent at Large with the understanding, and I don't know exactly when this happened, but I did get the title of administrative assistant, but I primarily reported to the associate director, who was J.D.

07:53.364 --> 07:55.327
Pruitt, whose wife still lives.

07:55.707 --> 07:57.309
P-R-U-I-T-T.

07:57.550 --> 08:03.337
P-R-E-W-E-T, I guess.

08:03.357 --> 08:04.178
Pruitt.

08:04.495 --> 08:06.717
P-R-U-E or E-W?

08:07.077 --> 08:08.338
P-R-E-W-I-T.

08:08.939 --> 08:09.779
I think that's it.

08:09.799 --> 08:10.580
Don't hold me on this.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.482
I'd have to... P-R-E-W-I-T-T.

08:12.502 --> 08:16.005
He was actually older than Mr. Gibson.

08:16.025 --> 08:20.949
And I guess I always like to deal in anecdotes.

08:22.630 --> 08:30.297
I had met Mr. Gibson when I was first in... Actually, when I started the Extension Service, there was another director.

08:31.898 --> 08:34.300
The graduates do...

08:34.280 --> 08:38.625
He became head of the graduate school, the dean of the graduate school, golly.

08:38.745 --> 08:39.626
Oh, George Quincy?

08:39.886 --> 08:40.567
No, no, no, no, no.

08:42.169 --> 08:42.970
He was an agronomist.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.832
I can't think of his name right now.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.213
He was actually director.

08:47.855 --> 08:49.997
He was a longtime head of the graduate program.

08:51.559 --> 08:51.999
Not Wayne Hall?

08:52.019 --> 08:52.760
Before Quincy.

08:52.780 --> 08:53.841
Not Wayne Hall.

08:53.861 --> 08:54.282
Oh, no, no.

08:54.362 --> 08:55.063
It was before that.

08:56.044 --> 08:57.025
That's before my memory.

08:57.045 --> 08:58.126
No.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.848
In fact, this guy had a Missouri background.

09:00.385 --> 09:01.889
Why can't I think of his name right now?

09:02.410 --> 09:03.393
The senior moment, I guess.

09:04.456 --> 09:10.994
Anyway, he was actually director, and the name will come to me before we leave.

09:11.014 --> 09:14.884
And Gibson had taken over just that time, and after I'd been employed,

09:15.708 --> 09:20.815
I met Gibson just once, you know, at some function or something.

09:21.495 --> 09:29.506
And I went to work in the county, but I told, before we started recording, I told you I used to go to Port Crockett a lot in my military training.

09:30.547 --> 09:39.218
And I had some rowdy former colleagues here at A&M, one of them who was in the med school down there, and we always got together.

09:39.198 --> 09:40.702
He showed me around the Mexican.

09:40.742 --> 09:43.568
They lived rather wildly, as you may know.

09:43.588 --> 09:47.698
Anyway, I was staying at a hotel or something.

09:47.738 --> 09:54.775
I remember this was years, two or three years later, and we came back from our activities about 2 a.m.

09:54.795 --> 09:55.958
in the morning, and there was

09:56.714 --> 09:58.718
Director Gibson on the elevator with me.

10:00.021 --> 10:02.626
And I said, well, you know, I don't really want him to know who I am.

10:02.666 --> 10:03.588
He doesn't remember me.

10:03.808 --> 10:07.155
I, uh, coming in at two o'clock in the morning.

10:07.877 --> 10:10.502
And so I just, you know, stood there without any particular grinning.

10:10.522 --> 10:11.905
He said, how are you, Von Steele?

10:13.960 --> 10:17.288
Of course, somebody told me later I could have asked him what he was doing at that time.

10:17.328 --> 10:21.036
One of the memories.

10:21.457 --> 10:27.210
All right, now in that first assignment of yours, how long did, here, about how long did that take?

10:27.545 --> 10:39.861
Well, it was with the understanding, I guess I came in in 55, and I guess they had identified me as, you know, a possible candidate for future administrative assignments.

10:40.622 --> 10:47.511
I was to work on this particular project, do other special things, you know, wrote a few speeches and things like that, but I primarily worked on this assignment.

10:47.491 --> 10:52.976
Anything you do in Texas that involves counties is a big job because you have to do it in many counties.

10:53.217 --> 10:57.561
And we had just calculators, a lot of number crunching, statistical analysis.

10:57.621 --> 11:03.026
I had enough statistics to worry that, but everything had to be done on a hand calculator.

11:03.046 --> 11:05.869
Of course, I had a secretary that helped a lot on that.

11:05.889 --> 11:12.756
And with the understanding that I would do further graduate work when the opportunity presented himself, and about that time,

11:12.736 --> 11:19.524
Kellogg Foundation funded this program at the University of Wisconsin, the National Agricultural Extension Center for Advanced Study.

11:20.285 --> 11:23.289
I applied for a scholarship and was given this in 57.

11:23.329 --> 11:27.454
So I'd only been here less than two years when I went off to graduate school in 57.

11:28.115 --> 11:29.317
To finish your PhD?

11:29.337 --> 11:37.106
To do my PhD and finished it in 59 and came back in and I was appointed assistant director at that time, mostly for special projects.

11:37.166 --> 11:38.608
I really didn't have much

11:39.314 --> 11:40.876
many people that I supervised.

11:40.896 --> 11:43.000
I was mostly working in special projects.

11:43.080 --> 11:58.304
I continued on this particular project and then was, even for a while, served for six months as acting, even at that age, acting director of the International Programs Office, which was working on a D.W.

11:58.324 --> 12:04.454
Williams office who was vice chancellor for agriculture on the second floor with the chancellor's office.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.355
And they were

12:05.335 --> 12:06.337
between people.

12:06.998 --> 12:13.729
And so I, that's when we had a big Pakistan or, well, it was East Pakistan then.

12:13.769 --> 12:16.333
It's now Bangladesh contract, one I think in Tunisia.

12:16.914 --> 12:18.176
So I got involved in that.

12:18.997 --> 12:28.612
Then I also got involved in this, Kellogg also had funded this National Agriculture Communication Project.

12:28.653 --> 12:30.195
I think I mentioned that before.

12:30.175 --> 12:38.909
where three of us were sent off to the University of Wyoming to get three weeks training with the indication when we came back we trained everybody else.

12:38.989 --> 12:41.132
We would train the trainer type of thing.

12:41.172 --> 12:48.924
At that time, you know, we thought they had a lot of radical new insights into communication and, you know, all of that type of thing.

12:49.345 --> 12:58.579
And so we went around the state, a team of us, two guys and a lady, that trained every single staff member on a district to district basis in that.

12:58.930 --> 13:03.416
Then I also always had my own project in mind that they let me loose on.

13:03.837 --> 13:17.855
It was to develop, and to this day, I still feel it's one of the contributions I made, is to develop a uniform filing system for the, all the reference materials that agents have to keep in their office so you could find things from one county to another.

13:18.236 --> 13:21.360
You know, there were some overall similarities in that.

13:21.340 --> 13:25.285
And after I did that, I also had to train everybody in that system.

13:25.466 --> 13:37.201
And another person and I trained every agent and secretary in the state on the implementation of this system and how to do it.

13:37.582 --> 13:41.307
And then just gradually I got

13:41.287 --> 13:47.627
Additional administrative assignments, let's see, that was in the early 60s.

13:48.148 --> 13:50.596
Trying to relate this, you probably remember when Rudder came here.

13:51.499 --> 13:53.625
It was sometime in the 60s, wasn't it?

13:54.112 --> 13:57.758
Oh, he came in late 1958.

13:57.778 --> 13:59.501
That's, yeah, okay.

14:01.304 --> 14:04.208
Without the official title as president.

14:04.228 --> 14:05.050
Yeah, I remember that.

14:05.070 --> 14:08.275
But apparently everyone... Yeah, recognized him.

14:08.315 --> 14:12.762
I was just trying to relate my own career to that.

14:13.130 --> 14:14.913
I guess it was, when was it in the 60s?

14:15.393 --> 14:18.278
I was always available to do special projects.

14:18.919 --> 14:20.822
It was about the time we undertook the Century Study.

14:20.842 --> 14:21.322
When was that?

14:21.443 --> 14:22.304
In 60?

14:22.424 --> 14:23.065
Or 62.

14:23.486 --> 14:24.367
Yeah.

14:24.387 --> 14:30.396
After doing some of these things, I was, I think we had to spend 20% of our time, because I was one of the

14:30.899 --> 14:36.148
recorders or something for one of the four groups, and we had to, you know, beat with them, make all the arrangements.

14:36.208 --> 14:39.593
Sometimes these groups met separately, as you recall, in different places.

14:39.633 --> 14:43.520
And I worked under you, I guess, at that time.

14:43.941 --> 14:48.007
Back when you got back with your Ph.D.

14:48.027 --> 14:52.415
in 59, Dr. Williams was, D.W.

14:52.435 --> 14:55.920
Williams was then the director of the Extension Service?

14:56.542 --> 14:57.463
No, no, no, no.

14:57.443 --> 14:58.985
Hutchison was by then.

14:59.305 --> 14:59.866
John Hutchison.

15:00.988 --> 15:04.973
Gibson left in, I think in 55, shortly after I came here.

15:05.133 --> 15:06.174
So he's replaced by?

15:06.194 --> 15:06.795
Hutchison.

15:07.115 --> 15:07.316
All right.

15:07.336 --> 15:17.309
Hutchison served 19 years until... Describe John Hutchison as... Well, John Hutchison was one of the most dedicated Extension people, I guess, I ever knew in my life.

15:17.389 --> 15:26.100
I mean, he was totally and thoroughly committed to Extension and was an extremely hard worker and

15:27.076 --> 15:31.727
had a set of principles that was very strong and that influenced me a great deal.

15:31.787 --> 15:36.519
I guess he was the person that I worked with the most, helped the most.

15:36.659 --> 15:39.526
In fact, you'll find this even amusing.

15:39.947 --> 15:43.836
He struggled for years to get his PhD from the University of Chicago

15:44.997 --> 15:46.799
But he made a mistake, which I didn't make.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.101
I wasn't going to make it.

15:48.181 --> 15:52.686
I was going to have my degree before I came back, because I knew once you get back, you get so involved.

15:52.926 --> 16:01.817
And in my experience in writing, it always takes about a half an hour or an hour to get going, to get into it.

16:01.837 --> 16:04.780
And once you get into it, you know, time really doesn't matter.

16:05.341 --> 16:06.482
You turn it out.

16:07.103 --> 16:11.089
But if you try to do it on weekends and an hour here and an hour there, it's very difficult.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.853
So I said I would not come back until I had it.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.217
But John got all his coursework done.

16:17.438 --> 16:20.243
He got his thesis pretty well going.

16:20.523 --> 16:23.648
He lacked the one language requirement.

16:23.668 --> 16:27.754
And you know who tutored him in Spanish?

16:27.774 --> 16:28.615
I did.

16:28.635 --> 16:29.837
And he did finally finish it.

16:30.425 --> 16:37.758
I think about 20 years later, he finally got his degree, but I don't know exactly when, but it took, I think it was 15, they didn't have a time limit there.

16:38.740 --> 16:48.457
I had a time, but University of Chicago at that time didn't have a time limit, but it took him 20, 25 years, I think, before he got that final requirement off.

16:49.138 --> 16:52.143
As the director, what was his normal routine?

16:52.203 --> 16:55.048
About when did he get to the office and when did he leave?

16:55.147 --> 17:03.098
Well, he and, I always, I guess I had as a model, he and Mr. Pruitt was still associate director, and he did the day-to-day work.

17:03.138 --> 17:08.246
He's got an alter ego, which I always felt was a good model of any type of organization.

17:08.266 --> 17:10.008
You have a Mr. Outside and a Mr. Inside.

17:10.028 --> 17:13.213
Somebody's got to, you know, make their decisions on a day-to-day basis.

17:13.293 --> 17:14.354
That was Mr. Pruitt.

17:14.394 --> 17:23.247
He was older, mature, and everybody trusted him, had total confidence in him, and he pretty well rhymed the shop, and John

17:24.020 --> 17:33.475
I mean, I'm not saying that John wasn't firmly in control, but John spent a lot of time out in the state doing the legislative thing, all of that.

17:35.839 --> 17:36.460
Cut that up.

17:36.480 --> 17:43.952
I'm going to... We're talking about work habits of my... Let's see, and we want to say on this machine that the name of the graduate...

17:44.422 --> 17:46.525
administrator we couldn't remember a while ago.

17:46.545 --> 17:50.631
Who was director when I was first appointed was I. P. Trotter.

17:50.831 --> 17:53.135
And that's I-D-E, that's his first name.

17:53.195 --> 17:53.976
P. Trotter.

17:54.597 --> 17:55.878
T-R-O-T-T-E-R.

17:55.899 --> 18:01.106
Yeah, and later he became dean of the, I think that was the title, dean of the graduate school or studies or something.

18:02.668 --> 18:03.209
I think so.

18:03.229 --> 18:04.992
All right, we were talking about John Hutchison.

18:05.012 --> 18:07.375
Well, okay, as I said,

18:08.603 --> 18:09.969
John Hutchison and J.D.

18:10.009 --> 18:11.054
Pruitt were a good team.

18:13.103 --> 18:14.349
They worked together very well.

18:15.936 --> 18:16.639
Mr. Pruitt

18:17.243 --> 18:36.647
I guess for years and years everybody had expected him someday to become director, but he never got an advanced degree, and I guess we're getting into the time where that became more significant because, well, Gibson didn't have one, but of course, well, Hutchison didn't have one when he became director, but he had, you know, worked on it.

18:36.687 --> 18:46.018
He had gone to the University of Chicago before he became, just before he became director, but anyway,

18:47.281 --> 18:47.722
J.D.

18:47.762 --> 18:49.686
Pruitt had been passed over two or three times.

18:49.807 --> 18:54.858
A lot of people had assumed that he should have been elevated or was a logical prospect.

18:54.878 --> 18:56.782
But anyway, I don't think it ever affected him.

18:56.842 --> 18:58.446
He just kept working away.

18:58.506 --> 19:05.121
He had work habits where he always was at the office at 7 o'clock in the morning.

19:05.101 --> 19:22.384
And I found out later that's a good thing to do because you can get everything done between 7 and 8 because from there on you're constantly interrupted in administration with telephone calls and, you know, whatever you plan to do for the day might, you know, one call from a congressman or the president's office or something may, you know, change everything.

19:22.955 --> 19:31.213
But he had the habit of coming at 7 and getting his work done, which caused one of the secretaries to confide in our supervisor of the stenographic staff.

19:31.795 --> 19:39.512
She was so sorry that Mr. Pruitt had a bad home life that he had to leave home so early in the morning to get away from it.

19:39.695 --> 19:44.781
But anyway, John always came in a little after eight because he didn't want to fight the traffic.

19:44.861 --> 19:46.203
You know, we even had traffic in those days.

19:46.223 --> 19:48.005
He'd come in a little bit later.

19:48.085 --> 19:51.890
But they had connecting offices, bathroom in between.

19:51.910 --> 19:53.552
It's still there that way.

19:53.612 --> 19:55.935
And they worked very well together.

19:56.075 --> 19:59.959
And John was very popular.

19:59.979 --> 20:03.964
He had been a horticultural specialist, was very popular and effective as a specialist.

20:04.505 --> 20:06.307
And as I said, gung-ho extension.

20:06.347 --> 20:08.790
I mean, as gung-ho as you can get.

20:08.855 --> 20:22.631
I guess I got some of that into me about becoming a fierce partisan for extension because we really believed in it, and still do, about the good it could do.

20:22.811 --> 20:37.528
I'd seen the good it had done for my family growing up in the Depression, and we really believed that our mission was to help the people out in those rural areas improve the quality of their lives, not just income, but the quality of their lives, particularly I think we

20:38.082 --> 20:50.179
Extension made a big contribution to improving the quality of lives, particularly of farm women, in terms of, you know, trying to get them to use more conveniences and better ways of doing things and so forth.

20:50.199 --> 21:02.516
In general, were most of the professional employees of the Extension service in your decades, in general were most of them products of an agricultural background?

21:02.536 --> 21:03.237
Oh, very definitely.

21:03.277 --> 21:05.440
In fact, one of the requirements

21:06.685 --> 21:10.650
at least in the agricultural area, didn't require it in the home economics, that you grew up on a farm or ranch.

21:10.690 --> 21:11.671
That was one of the questions.

21:12.252 --> 21:22.704
On the, on the, on the, on the, well, at that time, what, 80, 70 percent were still, and, you know, they felt you had to grow up in a rural, a farm area to be able to empathize with them.

21:22.724 --> 21:25.087
Do you remember anybody ever asking for an exception?

21:25.587 --> 21:27.129
Well, that started coming up later on.

21:27.249 --> 21:30.533
I mean, gradually, there were some people, you know, that,

21:30.513 --> 21:38.764
had gotten, you know, small rural towns, they might have not grown up on a farm or ranch, but they were very rural or they, you know, had connections and so forth.

21:38.784 --> 21:49.078
But I think, I think it took some years before that got eliminated from the, from the, but there was a definite question on the application, were you born and raised on a farm or ranch?

21:49.058 --> 21:56.551
Give some examples of the Hutchinson era in legislative work.

21:56.611 --> 21:57.453
How did he relate?

21:57.473 --> 22:01.340
Well, he was extremely successful, and that was in the John Connolly days.

22:01.360 --> 22:05.447
Of course, all of higher education, anything associated with higher education,

22:05.427 --> 22:10.172
And the Extension Service grew tremendously under his leadership.

22:11.633 --> 22:22.564
He was one of the early people who helped develop the Research and Extension, Area Research and Extension Center concept, where we began to staff them.

22:23.304 --> 22:35.316
One of the problems we had, as you can appreciate, contrasting Missouri and Texas, it's very hard to serve the whole state out of College Station with specialists who are expected to go out.

22:36.140 --> 22:38.664
And, you know, meet with agents and meet with farmers.

22:38.724 --> 22:45.355
In fact, specialists will be sent from here to Amarillo if necessary if there's a real problem, you know.

22:45.375 --> 22:48.180
And it's real hard to, you know, people send.

22:48.280 --> 22:56.795
And our specialists in those days, including people like Hutchison, probably spent three weeks out of each month on the road.

22:57.075 --> 23:01.843
I mean, you'd leave Monday morning and sometimes not get back till Saturdays or that type of thing.

23:01.823 --> 23:21.492
But anyway, that was, John was extremely successful in relating to what I call clientele groups, commodity groups, you know, the cotton growers, the Farm Bureau and other, and he garnered their support in getting additional positions at what we call at the area level, area specialist.

23:22.093 --> 23:25.418
He had a concept that was accepted in principle by the

23:26.950 --> 23:38.383
both the appropriations and agriculture committees that for each center, like at Amarillo, Lubbock, Dallas, and so forth, we would have at least one specialist for each major.

23:39.385 --> 23:50.798
You know, if cotton was big at Lubbock, we'd have a cotton man, we'd have an irrigation man because that was, and each of these staff, we had a staffing pattern indicated that

23:51.385 --> 23:56.318
You know, each one would have about 10 or 15, maybe some as many as 20 as specialists.

23:56.338 --> 23:57.863
So we didn't add a lot of specialists here.

23:57.903 --> 24:03.879
We did some in some of the newer developing fields like animal waste controlling on new things coming out.

24:03.899 --> 24:06.947
But most of the staffing was what we'd call at the area level.

24:07.417 --> 24:14.188
And that made county agents work a lot more effective because the county agent had to be a generalist.

24:14.268 --> 24:21.740
I mean, you dealt, even though you may have been trained in animal science, you had to handle agronomic problems, horticulture, everything.

24:21.760 --> 24:26.488
And to have the specialist closer by who was an expert in that area

24:26.468 --> 24:31.596
who might not be more than a few hours could, you know, help you, was very helpful.

24:31.977 --> 24:38.206
Other than John Connolly, at the state political level, who else was supportive during... Briscoe was very supportive.

24:38.226 --> 24:40.169
Briscoe was extremely supportive.

24:40.229 --> 24:42.693
In fact, you know, he wanted the Uvalde Center.

24:42.713 --> 24:45.237
Logically, it should have been located in San Antonio, but...

24:45.217 --> 24:48.843
for some reason it got located to Ubalde because he wanted it there.

24:48.863 --> 24:52.328
And that's been one of our better places for it.

24:52.448 --> 25:00.821
Were there any politicians during that time that were obstructionists or difficult to work with for extension?

25:01.222 --> 25:04.627
Well, we always had the tech A&M problem to deal with.

25:04.727 --> 25:13.401
I mean, there was, I guess, greater competition in those days because they had an agriculture program, a good program, and they wanted to

25:14.410 --> 25:16.232
be the Texas A&M of the High Plains.

25:16.292 --> 25:21.496
I mean, they thought, you know, they should have more of the research and extension dollars directly from there.

25:21.556 --> 25:24.779
But, of course, the extension services weren't set up that way.

25:24.819 --> 25:26.641
They were set up with the land-grant universities.

25:26.701 --> 25:36.029
But because of their geographical influence, and so the politicians were tech first, you know, people, and agriculture second, I guess you'd say.

25:36.049 --> 25:38.871
So you had to deal with that, and there were some really crusty ones.

25:39.352 --> 25:42.915
There was a former speaker from the Rolling Plains area

25:43.469 --> 26:01.311
I can't think of his name now, but I mean, he was really tough on us as it always related to, he's the one that asked me the question, I'm not a tech graduate, and I flabbergasted him by quoting the figure and he wouldn't believe it, but see, I was able to quote the women, which made a significant percentage of total, of the total.

26:01.331 --> 26:08.700
There weren't that many men, but anyway, but no, there were some very difficult battles, but John was very,

26:09.203 --> 26:21.455
very successful, John Hutchison was very successful in selling the concept of extension and the important role that scientific information would help in improving the lot of agriculture.

26:21.635 --> 26:32.546
When you all went to Austin for a hearing or a review, budget, so forth, who was the primary speaker for the extension service?

26:32.666 --> 26:33.967
John Hutchison.

26:33.987 --> 26:34.848
I always accompanied.

26:34.948 --> 26:37.050
I got, I was,

26:37.267 --> 27:01.131
got into the realm pretty I did all of the preparation of materials that including leaflets and you know bar charts and all of the stuff that you use and and making the hearings and well I even started that under Gibson I was taken along on those things but I was often in the background of preparing all the material and it as a separate state agency we had to

27:02.427 --> 27:18.968
spent a lot of time in Austin because we had to not only present our needs to the respective well later on we even had to go through the Higher Education Commission and make early on as you know make a pitch there because we had to have their support and then we had

27:19.218 --> 27:22.623
You know, the House, Senate had a committee that looked in agriculture.

27:22.663 --> 27:26.289
We first met with the substantive committees in both the House.

27:26.810 --> 27:28.092
And that was not just one time.

27:28.172 --> 27:33.461
I mean, sometimes we went to Austin, you know, like several times a month, spending two or three days.

27:34.222 --> 27:38.609
And then, of course, later on, the Appropriations Committees and the Senate Finance Committee and all of that.

27:39.370 --> 27:41.974
And it took a lot of preparation.

27:42.034 --> 27:46.221
And so I was heavily involved in all of that and saw how effective John was

27:46.690 --> 27:48.293
in dealing with the legislature, and he was.

27:48.734 --> 27:53.184
What kind of information did you find was most effective with the legislature?

27:53.204 --> 28:02.404
Well, we tried to, you know, in dealing with the legislature, which was becoming more urbanized, of course we recognized that, we tried to begin to develop more programs that had

28:03.295 --> 28:08.904
you know, some urban implications, particularly in the horticultural areas, landscaping and things like that.

28:09.004 --> 28:15.474
And, of course, in home economics, there really are no rural urban, at least, you know, in those days, it's beginning to break down.

28:15.554 --> 28:22.745
And, you know, trying to demonstrate that we served the thing, all people.

28:22.845 --> 28:25.810
And one of the things that, you know, John always was,

28:26.515 --> 28:31.560
trying to think of ideas, he came up with various campaigns like make Texas number one in agriculture.

28:31.580 --> 28:32.701
I mean, I don't even remember that.

28:33.562 --> 28:38.126
You know, we were second or third to Iowa and California.

28:38.146 --> 28:40.028
California's always one, of course.

28:40.048 --> 28:42.991
Iowa, I think, we're close to Iowa, but I think we're third or we're third.

28:43.611 --> 28:54.902
Anyway, he put out a big campaign, you know, all of this will help make Texas number one in agriculture and agriculture will benefit, you know, the entire economy and that's the kind of approach we do.

28:54.882 --> 29:08.723
Do you remember any specific examples of where a key decision was made in Austin, which in hindsight was very, very important?

29:11.183 --> 29:18.532
Oh, I don't know that I... Like something that there was a swing of a vote or a decision?

29:18.552 --> 29:22.076
In those days, I guess we had governors.

29:22.837 --> 29:29.364
We had mentioned Connelly, who had big agricultural interests, Briscoe, Smith, even though Smith was from West Texas.

29:29.384 --> 29:33.529
You know, they were all very supportive of agriculture and saw extension

29:33.931 --> 29:36.475
as a contributor to agricultural progress.

29:36.876 --> 29:48.534
Before y'all went to Austin for any kind of legislative review, what kind of oversight did Mr. Rutter give to whatever the presentation might be?

29:50.197 --> 29:58.690
Well, once the, within the, within the university or the system, university or system, whatever the case might be,

29:59.193 --> 30:05.590
Once the decision was made to what the budget request would be, everyone supported it.

30:06.332 --> 30:08.478
We supported the experiment station.

30:08.498 --> 30:09.721
They supported ours and everything.

30:10.323 --> 30:13.371
And Mr. Rudder, who participated,

30:13.891 --> 30:24.915
and other presidents in these presentations would usually just give a general background of importance of agriculture and so forth, and then the various agency heads would make their own pitch.

30:25.236 --> 30:29.706
How did you all feel about Mr. Rudder's relationship with the Extension Service?

30:32.892 --> 30:35.715
Supportive, I think, just generally.

30:35.795 --> 30:36.315
Supportive.

30:36.396 --> 30:46.186
I mean, as true as you probably know, Extension exists in a lot of land-grant universities and a lot of land-grant presidents have other things to be worried about.

30:46.726 --> 31:02.342
And Extension pretty well is often left alone or it's... But he, perhaps more than any other president in recent times, he had a better experience with the realities of agriculture.
