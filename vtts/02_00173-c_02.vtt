00:03.237 --> 00:07.685
You're the consultant now to advise Texas A&M's leaders.

00:07.705 --> 00:13.975
What advice would you give them about Texas A&M moving progressively forward in the future?

00:15.538 --> 00:21.468
Well, I would say go back to teaching them freshman English.

00:21.488 --> 00:23.912
And that would include maybe some of the faculty.

00:25.394 --> 00:26.235
But I think that.

00:27.577 --> 00:30.261
You're meaning fewer TAs, fewer teaching.

00:30.341 --> 00:31.603
No, I don't.

00:32.204 --> 00:40.276
I think that we've been very fortunate over the years we've had some TAs that I would have welcomed going to school with.

00:40.856 --> 00:41.698
Not that at all.

00:41.758 --> 00:54.456
I'm talking about the fact now that you can escape from this school without ever having written a paper in English class and have anybody judge your English and correct your mistakes.

00:55.786 --> 00:59.512
And I would recommend that every student be required to take speech.

01:01.254 --> 01:05.401
And everybody be given a course in reading.

01:06.903 --> 01:10.729
I can't see how anybody can become educated without learning to read.

01:12.932 --> 01:17.018
And I don't see how we can transform what we know.

01:18.415 --> 01:28.854
into projects that are successful without being able to write and to speak and to present our ideas clearly.

01:30.497 --> 01:43.039
All of mine would be from the narrow view of recommendations of a teacher of how we can best present ourselves by having students who can

01:45.280 --> 01:50.425
meet people, talk, and write.

01:50.445 --> 01:56.812
And of course, they are well-read, so they have something to talk about.

01:56.832 --> 01:57.072
All right.

01:57.092 --> 01:58.474
Next, the last question then.

01:59.235 --> 02:12.148
If someone walked up to you and gave you a check for a million dollars with one requirement, that you must pass it on to Texas A&M, but you can decide what use would be made of that money,

02:13.293 --> 02:19.424
If you could make a meaningful gift to A&M, what would you want that gift to go for?

02:23.131 --> 02:30.364
Well, I guess it would be to give scholarships to minority students.

02:32.988 --> 02:33.730
What minorities?

02:34.491 --> 02:35.132
All minorities.

02:36.766 --> 02:38.128
And how would they be selected?

02:38.488 --> 02:47.961
Well, I would say, first of all, on the grounds of ability and need.

02:51.285 --> 02:53.528
I don't think everybody needs to be educated.

02:55.691 --> 03:02.200
And I've met some self-educated people, beginning with my father, who

03:03.884 --> 03:08.168
had great success without ever having a formal education.

03:08.328 --> 03:20.080
I was consulted by two people about writing, and both of them apologized because they didn't have formal educations.

03:21.101 --> 03:25.305
I said, because they weren't educated.

03:25.425 --> 03:27.067
I said, no, you're educated.

03:27.107 --> 03:28.468
You're obviously educated.

03:28.509 --> 03:33.013
You wouldn't have achieved what you've achieved in life already.

03:33.095 --> 03:35.498
I said, you just don't have a formal education.

03:35.778 --> 03:36.819
You're self-educated.

03:38.701 --> 03:53.758
And I think if we could find the people who would be successful, self-educated people, and give them the added bonus of a formal education, that would be what I'd like to do with the money.

03:54.158 --> 03:56.421
In your desire, would it matter what their major was?

03:56.921 --> 03:58.123
Yeah.

03:58.143 --> 04:00.165
As my father said, I don't give a damn

04:01.462 --> 04:05.067
What you take or where you go, you're going.

04:06.870 --> 04:17.126
And that was the thing that made me where I am today, that one simple statement.

04:17.146 --> 04:22.914
My last question then, what feelings do you carry in your heart today for Texas A&M?

04:24.657 --> 04:26.179
Well, it was very good to me.

04:28.223 --> 04:29.224
I had a good life here.

04:30.908 --> 04:37.195
I found my wife here and have far many friendships here.

04:37.255 --> 04:48.046
And I still enjoy going to A&M and meeting colleagues, new younger people.

04:48.967 --> 04:50.729
And some of the old ones are still there.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.872
Fewer and fewer by the day.

04:54.814 --> 04:55.535
Let's quit with that.

04:55.795 --> 04:56.095
Okay.

04:56.275 --> 04:56.916
That's great.
