311 class.

00:58.013 --> 01:04.783
I'm interviewing Mary Lancaster, and she's going 
to give us a short biographical sketch before we

00:58.013 --> 01:04.783
begin the interview. Thank you, Becky. I was born 
Mary Laverne Whiteside in Teague, Texas, which is

01:07.007 --> 01:15.279
in Freestone County. In 1930, I was born to Matty 
Ora and Talmadge Whiteside. who had lived in Texas

01:25.317 --> 01:38.854
all of their lives, who had been married for 22 
years without children, and finally, in their

01:25.317 --> 01:38.854
middle age, had one child. I lived in Freestone 
County for several years and then moved to

01:39.635 --> 01:53.653
Normandy, Texas, which is in Leon County, when I 
was eight. and lived there until I finished high

01:54.460 --> 01:57.784
school. Then I went to Baylor University for four 
years, and then came to Bryan and College Station

01:58.544 --> 02:10.858
to work as a Girl Scout Executive Director. Here I 
met my husband, who had lived here all of his life,

02:12.299 --> 02:17.805
and we were married. I married William B. 
Lancaster, and we have now had three children. And

02:24.616 --> 02:35.289
we live at 303 Dexter and College Station and have 
lived here almost all of our married life and hope

02:24.616 --> 02:35.289
to the rest of our lives. Okay. How many or how long 
has your family been in this general area? My

02:41.696 --> 02:47.483
grandparents and their parents came to Texas. 
They came either from Alabama, or Mississippi,

02:51.430 --> 02:57.256
soon after the Civil War. Most often came, I 
suppose, because most of everything they had

02:57.296 --> 03:09.509
worked for was destroyed there, or the frontier 
here seemed more profitable. One group of

03:10.530 --> 03:19.800
great-grandparents came to Arkansas and settled 
for about 10 years, and then came on to Texas.

03:20.962 --> 03:25.267
leaving four little children buried in Arkansas, 
I remember. Then another set of

03:26.108 --> 03:39.603
great-grandparents came from Mississippi down 
and settled in the lower eastern part of Texas,

03:26.108 --> 03:39.603
which is now Beaumont. They settled there for a few 
years, but because the climate was so humid and

03:39.623 --> 03:49.635
damp and they felt it was not healthy, They sold 
their land there for a penny an acre, just as a legal

03:49.970 --> 04:01.523
transaction, and moved up to Leon County, where 
they have lived since that time. And now that's

04:01.543 --> 04:08.992
where the Beaumont oil wells are.

04:09.012 --> 04:13.497
Oh, goodness.

04:15.333 --> 04:19.598
So then your relatives were from, originally, 
like the Deep Sound. Yes, from Mississippi and

04:19.618 --> 04:28.748
Alabama, and then prior to that, most of them came 
from the Carolinas before that time. Okay, could

04:29.489 --> 04:35.716
you compare how your father and, like, say, your 
grandfather or even great-grandfather made

04:29.489 --> 04:35.716
their livings? Yes. Now, when those, the, my 
father... made his living, he was raised on the

04:43.784 --> 04:48.170
farm. I believe the acreages that were given out as 
land grants were about 108 acres each. And both my

04:57.183 --> 05:03.272
mother's family and my father's family had a 
108-acre plot. I suppose they homesteaded this

05:03.773 --> 05:06.998
land. I don't know if they had to pay for it or if it 
was given to them. But they were both raised on this

05:11.088 --> 05:16.234
land. There they raised almost everything that 
they used. They were almost self-sufficient.

05:25.746 --> 05:33.075
This little community where they grew up is about 
35 miles from Brownlee. And twice each year, they

05:33.095 --> 05:36.960
would come in wagons to get the supplies that they 
had to have other than what they grew on their

05:37.463 --> 05:43.731
farms. Now, their principal income, I think, was 
cotton. They could raise two to three to four bales

05:48.618 --> 05:53.404
of cotton a year. This is hand planted, hand

05:53.424 --> 06:05.580
cultivated, hand picked cotton done by the family 
itself. maybe some corn for their livestock. They

06:11.134 --> 06:23.368
had fruit trees, large gardens, chickens, and 
beef and pork that they raised for themselves. The

06:23.388 --> 06:32.378
only things they really needed to buy were flour 
and sugar and coffee and candy. this sort of thing.

06:35.468 --> 06:47.582
So they grew up in a rural community where they did 
everything they could themselves as far as their

06:35.468 --> 06:47.582
own livelihood. Then my father and my mother left 
the farm soon after they were married and my father

06:47.602 --> 06:59.296
did various jobs all throughout his life. He had 
only an elementary education, and he lived in

07:01.248 --> 07:08.697
different areas.

07:11.760 --> 07:23.494
They lived in Dallas and where I was born in 
Freestone County and then back in Madison and Leon

07:11.760 --> 07:23.494
County. All their lives, he did many things.

07:29.767 --> 07:32.029
He owned several grocery stores. He owned several 
service stations. He worked as a very young man as

07:38.236 --> 07:42.721
an ice delivery boy in Dallas. He worked in a tin 
shop as a young man. Finally, in his later years, he

07:49.689 --> 07:59.419
was a wholesale distributor for Mobil Air, most of 
my growing up years. enjoyed this very much.

08:01.455 --> 08:18.934
Before he went with Mobil in the 30s, I believe it 
was the late 20s or early 30s, there was an oil field

08:01.455 --> 08:18.934
which came into being in East Texas around Kilgore 
and Longview. And with the coming of this oil well,

08:18.954 --> 08:28.605
they produced cheaper gasoline than the major oil 
companies. And He was in business for himself for

08:29.302 --> 08:33.928
several years during the Depression. My family 
was not really affected as much as a lot of others

08:35.149 --> 08:41.517
because he used this opportunity. He had his own 
wholesale truck and he had a chain of service

08:41.557 --> 08:55.073
stations that he serviced with this cheaper 
gasoline that people needed very much at the time

08:41.557 --> 08:55.073
of the Depression. and made quite a bit of money at 
that time for the times. Well, in general, how do

09:01.512 --> 09:07.477
you feel that the Depression affected this 
general area? Do you have any sort of feeling about

09:07.918 --> 09:10.120
that? Well, I can remember the Depression very 
well, or the times. I know people were so much more

09:17.507 --> 09:23.592
conservative in their living.

09:24.348 --> 09:33.177
There were a lot of people roaming the country at 
that time, just as they were termed tramps. You

09:33.197 --> 09:39.925
never hear that word much anymore, but they were 
single men who were out of work. So many, you'd see

09:40.766 --> 09:54.220
them on the highways, and you'd see them riding on 
trains and boxcars, and they would just go from

09:40.766 --> 09:54.220
town to town looking for work or looking for... 
something to eat i can remember many people coming

09:55.330 --> 10:17.119
to my mother's back door not never the front but to 
the back of the back door and asked for something to

09:55.330 --> 10:17.119
eat and my mother felt that maybe they were contact 
points in a town that because she had so many that

09:55.330 --> 10:17.119
maybe one would tell another But she never refused 
anybody anything to eat. But you never see this

10:21.788 --> 10:24.513
type thing now. And they were white men. I never 
remember seeing a black person going from door to

10:27.318 --> 10:34.711
door asking for something to eat. I remember one 
Sunday in particular, it was about 1936.

10:42.783 --> 10:52.414
someone knocked at our back door, and my mother 
went to the door, and it was a young man in his

10:42.783 --> 10:52.414
mid-twenties, and asked if he might have 
something to eat. My mother, of course, never let

10:52.434 --> 10:59.041
someone in the house, because she was afraid to, 
and my dad was gone. And she latched the door,

10:59.061 --> 11:08.031
screaming, and of course, at that day, there was so 
much less violence than there is now. and she fixed

11:08.669 --> 11:31.572
him a sandwich or something to eat and as he turned 
to walk away she could see that all of his pockets

11:08.669 --> 11:31.572
filled with something to eat that he was stocking 
up from or maybe he was getting something for a

11:08.669 --> 11:31.572
friend but um the depression it's hard for me to say 
it didn't affect my family Because of this

11:32.665 --> 11:38.895
opportunity that my dad took at that time, we 
probably lived as well or better during the

11:39.685 --> 11:45.813
Depression as any other time in my life. But 
others, I know, were affected, and it made an

11:46.454 --> 11:55.065
entirely different kind of atmosphere with the 
people. I think it was a real sobering, had a real

11:55.185 --> 12:03.516
sobering effect on the people, which we may need 
some of that today. Okay, do you remember anything

12:04.525 --> 12:12.777
about, like, the type of house your grandparents 
lived in, you know, as compared to the house that

12:04.525 --> 12:12.777
you grew up in? Yes. Now, my daddy's, in fact, my 
daddy was born in a log cabin. His father built this

12:20.027 --> 12:26.837
log cabin when they came to Texas from Arkansas. I 
don't know if it was a one room, or I think it was, but

12:27.425 --> 12:38.802
it was very, very well constructed, my dad said, 
because he tore it down later. And he worked, it was

12:39.122 --> 12:49.397
put together with pegs, or in some way, it was 
almost impossible to tear it down. But he was born

12:49.577 --> 12:54.865
in this log cabin, and I do think it had just a dirt 
floor. And this is where they lived. when they

12:56.888 --> 12:59.090
first came to Texas. And then after, I don't know 
how long a period of time, I suppose whenever the

12:59.290 --> 13:08.258
time permitted for them to build a better house. 
But the type of houses they lived in, they were

13:08.318 --> 13:20.168
wooden houses with usually just one or two large 
rooms with a fireplace. And then sometimes the

13:21.329 --> 13:26.473
kitchens were detached so that you stepped down 
and then back up into this other room for the

13:27.128 --> 13:32.533
kitchen. I can remember seeing a house with a 
detached kitchen. And I believe an elderly aunt of

13:39.059 --> 13:43.143
mine lived in it. And for the step between the main 
house and the kitchen, there was a big tree stump,

13:43.984 --> 13:52.592
big round tree stump. And you step down on that. and 
then back up into the kitchen. And I'm not sure what

13:57.342 --> 14:05.715
the purpose of this was, unless it was the heat in 
the summer to keep the other house from being so

13:57.342 --> 14:05.715
hot. Or if it was for sanitary purposes, I'm not 
sure. But I can remember my dad telling how much fun

14:11.323 --> 14:19.736
it was as a little boy to watch the men build 
chimneys. And any time someone needed a house

14:20.817 --> 14:24.102
built in the community, All the men went and helped 
the women cook food. It was just a real fun time to do

14:27.938 --> 14:31.482
this. But the most fun was the chimney. They were 
mud chimneys made with moss off the trees. They'd

14:41.393 --> 14:50.303
make mud, a big wet mud bat, and then take what he 
called little bats. They would make the mud bats.

14:52.702 --> 14:58.873
They would probably be about the size of a brick 
now, or maybe not as thick. But they'd take moss and

14:58.893 --> 15:12.295
dip it into this mud and form it as best they could 
into some kind of a solid and put it out to dry. Or

15:12.315 --> 15:13.918
maybe they didn't even dry it. They may have just 
stacked it. Mm-hmm. On poles, on the frame, they'd

15:16.023 --> 15:21.588
build a chimney frame, and the moss would hold the 
mud together. And they'd stack them on the

15:22.449 --> 15:26.752
chimney, and I suppose it dried then to solidify 
it. And they had coated it on the outside with mud.

15:30.035 --> 15:33.558
And how this kept from washing away, I don't know. 
Maybe they put something on it to keep it from it.

15:37.602 --> 15:45.068
But their houses were, the floors, I know he said, 
were just sort of rough. wood, all the lumber was

15:45.537 --> 15:48.921
real rough in that day. The floors were rough, and 
the way his mother cleaned the floors, she would

15:49.542 --> 16:14.413
put sand in sometimes on the floors at certain 
times of the year for special house cleaning, and

15:49.542 --> 16:14.413
had a real strong broom, and they would scour with 
the sand and wash it away, and this would help sand

15:49.542 --> 16:14.413
the roughness of the floors, and over a period of 
years, the floors would get smooth. You know. Oh.

16:17.362 --> 16:27.497
But their houses were all very, very simple wood 
houses with a porch across the front. And

16:27.517 --> 16:34.687
sometimes there would be holes in the floors and 
they were not airtight. And the fireplace was

16:34.707 --> 16:39.254
usually their only source of heat. Is that the type 
of house you grew up in? No. Now here's when I Of

16:45.713 --> 17:04.450
course, we had, by that time,

16:45.713 --> 17:04.450
there were all the conveniences, the indoor 
bathrooms, the electricity,

16:45.713 --> 17:04.450
gas heating, that sort of thing, and carpeting. 
Oh, so you grew up in a more modern-time house. A

17:08.814 --> 17:09.394
modern-time house. Now, I grew up in a very small 
community, and the houses were not... not as nice

17:15.278 --> 17:18.142
of course as they are today. But they were very 
comfortable. I see. We used space heaters in the

17:22.828 --> 17:26.052
house where I grew up. Space gas heaters. There was 
no central heating and there was no air

17:29.036 --> 17:34.483
conditioning. And I think the real luxury that I 
can remember as a child was being able to have an

17:37.452 --> 17:44.123
electric fan on when you slept at night. That was 
the most luxurious thing you could have. The

17:49.231 --> 17:56.022
heating was very modern by that time, but the 
electric air conditioning didn't come into

17:49.231 --> 17:56.022
being. It was not really prevalent until I was 
homeschooled. What types of general changes has

18:01.972 --> 18:12.632
there been in, say, livelihood activities from 
the time you grew up to the present? Are there more

18:13.534 --> 18:16.059
people or fewer people farming? Or if there are 
fewer people, what are these other people doing?

18:20.207 --> 18:22.210
Just the general types of occupation. When I was 
growing up, there were... very few occupations to

18:24.635 --> 18:54.102
choose from if you what I mean your choice of 
occupation was very limited whereas now a young

18:24.635 --> 18:54.102
person going to college has so many choices that it 
probably is hard for them to decide what to do but

18:24.635 --> 18:54.102
choices were very very limited and in my area uh 
farming and ranching ranching became more

18:54.537 --> 19:06.412
popular than farming as I was growing up because 
the price of beef began to go up after the

18:54.537 --> 19:06.412
Depression and during World War II and later. And 
people did really become quite wealthy off of beef

19:06.432 --> 19:16.665
cattle in my day just simply because they did have 
the land. I can remember the transition from

19:16.806 --> 19:22.553
farming to ranching. they introduced coastal 
Bermuda grass into this part of the country. In

19:30.125 --> 19:39.281
fact, my husband's father was a grass specialist, 
and he brought both St. Augustine and coastal

19:30.125 --> 19:39.281
Bermuda into this country. But that made such a 
difference in cattle raising, and people began to

19:39.301 --> 19:48.237
improve their land to fertilize their grass and to 
sprig it with coastal Bermuda. This was an

19:54.169 --> 19:58.975
expensive process at that time, it seemed. But 
people began doing this and improving fences. And

20:02.439 --> 20:12.250
until now, that little rural community over there 
is just a beautiful area with such beautiful brick

20:02.439 --> 20:12.250
homes. And their land is so well cared for. Where at 
one time it had been the part that was not used for

20:17.343 --> 20:28.052
farming had just been thicket or not good for 
anything. But the people had cleared it with large

20:28.072 --> 20:37.260
equipment, heavy equipment, and left just enough 
trees for shade. And it sprigged with coastal

20:38.101 --> 20:39.802
Bermuda. And that whole area almost is ranching 
now. And Rockport's right at the moment. The price

20:46.958 --> 20:54.568
of beef has gone down, so this has really hurt them, 
and I'm sure this is probably a temporary thing.

20:56.069 --> 21:08.545
Can you think of any other techniques or 
innovations in farming or ranching, you know,

20:56.069 --> 21:08.545
that have really made a big, big difference 
besides the new grasses? Like different types of

21:10.145 --> 21:14.614
irrigation? Now there were a few cotton farmers 
still left over in that part of the country and of

21:14.775 --> 21:29.706
course around here we still had cotton farmers and 
now you have to be You have to operate on a pretty

21:30.395 --> 21:35.484
large scale if you're in the cotton business. 
There are no more small cotton farmers. And

21:41.436 --> 21:49.471
irrigation has really helped in this area as far as 
cotton is concerned. They control the growth. And

21:51.168 --> 21:54.311
of course the mechanization of the kickers. So 
they can operate on just very large scales. And the

21:59.517 --> 22:08.906
cotton industry is controlled by just a few 
families who still operate that type of thing. And

22:09.867 --> 22:17.175
with cattle, of course inoculations and the 
improvement of feed. and that sort of thing. Now,

22:20.740 --> 22:29.230
something interesting that over where I grew up, 
there were people who raised hogs. And they raised

22:31.072 --> 22:38.781
them in parts of the country that were just real 
wooded, that was not really good for anything

22:31.072 --> 22:38.781
else. And people, I know some people who became 
wealthy off of these wild hogs. They bred in there,

22:44.368 --> 22:47.652
and they had no care During the year, they lived off 
of acorns and whatever else they could scrounge

22:48.121 --> 22:58.755
for food because they were a hardy type, almost 
wild animal. And then at certain times of the year,

22:59.256 --> 23:08.828
once or maybe twice, they'd go in there and round up 
those hogs and take them to market and sell them.

23:09.669 --> 23:16.238
And the meat was not nearly so good as the corn-fed 
or... But back in my youth, this was not as

23:16.623 --> 23:22.910
important as it is now. And people, this was just 
clear profit. All you had to do was, if you could

23:27.494 --> 23:42.310
manage to keep from getting killed by them, you'd 
round them up and take them in, and it would make

23:27.494 --> 23:42.310
quite a profit if you had a large herd of hogs that 
you had in the market.

23:48.095 --> 23:52.701
Coming into town only twice a year for all your 
supplies and then not coming back. Well, my dad had

23:53.462 --> 23:56.886
so many interesting things to tell. It was just the 
highlight of the year to come to Bryan. They came in

24:01.511 --> 24:02.452
wagons. I'm not sure if they were covered or plain, 
probably depending on whether it was what type of

24:02.913 --> 24:14.207
year, what kind of time of year it was. But it would 
take all day. to drive to Brown in a wagon. And Brown

24:21.305 --> 24:29.821
at that time had a large wagon yard on the north end 
near Main Street, the north end of the business

24:21.305 --> 24:29.821
district there. And wagons that came in would park 
there and spend the night. And then you could shop

24:36.134 --> 24:39.280
and visit around town. And my dad talks, my dad's 
father died when he was two, but he had some grown

24:39.918 --> 24:48.897
brothers and sisters. My daddy was born when his 
youngest sister was 17 years old. So he was quite an

24:56.352 --> 24:59.158
afterthought. And his brothers, he grew up with 
brothers and their families, with his mother. But

25:07.647 --> 25:17.130
he tells of the time that his brother brought him 
and his little nephew, who was about his age. to

25:17.684 --> 25:34.428
Brian and with others, and they saw their first 
train coming to Brian, and he said it was the

25:17.684 --> 25:34.428
biggest thing he'd ever seen with lights, and that 
his brother had to hold their hands so tight to keep

25:17.684 --> 25:34.428
them from running away. They were so scared of the 
train, but that was the most exciting thing.

25:40.256 --> 25:47.286
Something my dad said that I remember, that when he 
grew up out in the country, There was no sound.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.032
There was no noise. And in his later years, he felt 
that the noises of day-to-living really affected

25:51.535 --> 25:59.146
people in their personalities. That he could play 
all day long outside and never hear anything

26:00.188 --> 26:10.082
except locusts or crickets or birds. There were no 
sounds. There was not even a train whistle from

26:12.626 --> 26:17.794
where he lived. There was no noise. And the 
people's personalities were much calmer, much,

26:19.396 --> 26:28.507
they were just real different. And as he grew 
older, keep the noise of everything we do, the

26:32.002 --> 26:48.825
children who grow up with noise always in their 
home, with TVs, with stereos, radios, this must

26:32.002 --> 26:48.825
affect their personalities. I never thought 
about how quiet it must have been. My dad tells

26:53.551 --> 27:00.221
about the time, talking about the cotton. They 
would bring their cotton. They would have to carry

27:02.465 --> 27:06.170
their cotton to cotton gins. At some point, they 
didn't bring them all the way to Brine,

27:07.432 --> 27:20.032
but they would take them, it would be quite a ways to 
the nearest cotton gin, several miles. So when

27:20.052 --> 27:21.634
they would get them, wagon full of cotton. They 
would tie cotton sheet over it to protect it until

27:24.117 --> 27:32.990
they were ready to take it to the gym, which might be 
a day or two later. And my daddy's grandmother came

27:35.554 --> 27:41.783
from Alabama in her very late years to live with my 
daddy and his mother. And she had become senile.

27:52.783 --> 28:02.996
And at that time, there was no place, nothing that 
you could do for mental patients, or very few

27:52.783 --> 28:02.996
places to handle mental patients. And she was 
just, as we know now, it's just hardening of the

28:03.016 --> 28:10.105
arteries, and had become senile. And they had a a 
room, one of the rooms in the house that they

28:12.492 --> 28:35.226
boarded the windows and fixed so that if she got to 
the front door, she began talking about running

28:12.492 --> 28:35.226
away, they could put her in there and lock her up if 
they had to do something and work if they weren't

28:12.492 --> 28:35.226
able to watch her all the time so they know she 
wouldn't get lost. And she lived with them for

28:36.522 --> 28:40.551
several years. And my dad talked, she must have 
been in her 80s or quite elderly, but he said she

28:40.751 --> 28:48.527
could run like a deer. And if she wanted to get away, 
Then he would have, it was his job, if she ever got

28:52.908 --> 29:06.829
away from him, she'd just decide all of a sudden 
that she didn't always want to run away, but there

28:52.908 --> 29:06.829
were times when she was going to do something and 
they'd try to keep her from going and then she'd

28:52.908 --> 29:06.829
run. And they had barbed wire fences. And he said 
she could just outrun him and run and get to a barbed

29:10.454 --> 29:20.088
wire fence and lie down and roll under it and jump up 
on the other side and run off. And when he did catch

29:20.128 --> 29:21.430
her, He'd have to get her back through that chance. 
And she was such a hard thing to handle. But as he

29:29.098 --> 29:33.302
grew up as a little boy, this was one of the part of 
his life. Well, then this was his mother's mother.

29:39.509 --> 29:46.557
Then his father's father came from Arkansas for a 
period of time and lived with him. And he was a very

29:47.638 --> 29:49.560
old man. And he was, in his old age, he was a basket 
weaver. And he loved to, and he made a little bit of

29:55.497 --> 30:07.327
money along selling baskets because at times they 
picked cotton in baskets. And they used them for

30:07.347 --> 30:10.910
all sorts of things on the farms. And people would 
buy them from him. And he watched them as a little

30:12.892 --> 30:14.774
boy. And he would go out into the wooded area and 
pick out a small tree and bring it home. And then he

30:24.883 --> 30:29.790
would strip it into very thin strips. He would peel 
thin strips of wood off this tree down to the very

30:29.810 --> 30:35.699
middle. And then he'd soak the strips of wood in 
something until they were soft, and he made

30:35.719 --> 30:46.534
baskets. And the basket man, my 
great-grandfather, was married three times. He

30:53.910 --> 30:56.598
outlived three wives. And by the last marriage he 
had of his last child,
