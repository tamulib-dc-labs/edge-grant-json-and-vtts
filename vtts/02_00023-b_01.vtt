WEBVTT

00:02.225 --> 00:03.526
You were there?

00:03.626 --> 00:04.107
Every time.

00:04.627 --> 00:05.468
And where was it held?

00:05.528 --> 00:06.089
Describe it.

00:07.290 --> 00:08.731
I have two memories of Muster.

00:11.353 --> 00:18.039
One time it was held out in front of the administration building.

00:18.059 --> 00:20.261
And I believe we were seniors then.

00:20.281 --> 00:20.702
I think.

00:21.943 --> 00:27.088
And it seems I recall before that it was held in G. Raleigh.

00:27.108 --> 00:27.728
But am I right?

00:28.189 --> 00:28.609
I think so.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.831
It was held outside.

00:31.334 --> 00:32.696
Muster was a big deal.

00:34.338 --> 00:37.343
A lot of people were coming back to campus that hadn't been there in a long time.

00:37.623 --> 00:39.847
You know, it was a homecoming.

00:39.907 --> 00:47.158
I do not recall if they inducted classes at Muster like they do now and the soil loss and all that.

00:47.919 --> 00:51.224
If they did, I didn't know anything about it.

00:51.364 --> 00:56.211
Did you ever hear any names called out at Muster that were familiar to you?

00:58.638 --> 01:02.182
Any people you had known that had already gone to Vietnam and given their lives?

01:02.622 --> 01:04.244
Not that I remember, to tell you the truth.

01:04.664 --> 01:07.127
I really don't.

01:07.167 --> 01:09.589
See, for me as a faculty member, that was always painful.

01:10.050 --> 01:10.170
Right.

01:10.190 --> 01:14.274
To hear the name called of somebody I had had as a senior two years earlier.

01:14.594 --> 01:16.616
Right.

01:16.636 --> 01:23.143
No, you get to the local clubs now and you hear the names and you know most of them.

01:26.046 --> 01:26.566
Let's see.

01:26.607 --> 01:28.088
Earl Rudder.

01:28.422 --> 01:32.065
describe him, what he looked like, your impression of him?

01:32.686 --> 01:40.033
I never shook his hand, but as far as saying I actually met him or ever knew him, that would be stretching the truth.

01:41.954 --> 01:46.479
As I recall, he wasn't a tremendously tall man.

01:46.599 --> 01:56.708
He had a tremendous amount of respect from everyone on the campus, and I think he had it from the faculty as well as the students.

01:57.245 --> 02:07.394
There weren't any, you weren't going to have a riot or any insurrection on campus with him there, you know, just strength.

02:09.436 --> 02:10.517
Okay, Jack Williams.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.641
Dr. Williams met him once or twice.

02:16.682 --> 02:19.264
See, he came in about the time I was going out.

02:19.885 --> 02:24.249
He was actually, was that the spring of 71 when he was inaugurated?

02:24.749 --> 02:25.750
It was a big gala.

02:26.118 --> 02:27.560
And it was a big deal.

02:28.441 --> 02:29.563
I never really knew him.

02:30.224 --> 02:32.488
I was graduating about the time he came in.

02:32.908 --> 02:37.054
His name's on my phone.

02:37.475 --> 02:44.245
And going to that inauguration, did that give you any impression of him and his qualities or anything, his abilities?

02:44.986 --> 02:50.134
Well, at the time we were probably too young to give it that much thought, frankly.

02:50.519 --> 02:56.864
And, but, you know, he seemed like a fellow who knew what he was doing, came with good credentials.

02:57.485 --> 03:01.248
As far as how hard we as students studied all that, I would say probably not very hard.

03:03.310 --> 03:08.174
Describe the community of College Station as you understood it.

03:08.615 --> 03:10.236
What businesses were where?

03:10.356 --> 03:16.401
What did you, students, where did you all go to do any shopping or dining or playing?

03:18.683 --> 03:19.564
What was at Northgate?

03:20.877 --> 03:25.141
Lupo's was on the corner.

03:25.161 --> 03:26.923
And then there was a hamburger place down there.

03:26.943 --> 03:27.924
What do they call it now?

03:28.565 --> 03:30.086
It's right there at the intersection.

03:30.507 --> 03:31.388
Dixie Chicken?

03:31.408 --> 03:32.089
No.

03:32.149 --> 03:32.909
Chicken wasn't there.

03:33.110 --> 03:34.431
Yeah, further west.

03:34.511 --> 03:36.433
Yeah, further down there was a hamburger place there.

03:39.076 --> 03:42.119
In town there was a, it wasn't too much.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.884
There was a Mexican restaurant we used to go to and I can't remember the name of it.

03:46.904 --> 03:50.007
We did go to Mall Bell's once or twice for dinner.

03:50.358 --> 03:55.182
Went in the kitchen one time, never went back.

03:57.825 --> 03:59.667
Wasn't a whole lot of shopping done around there really.

03:59.947 --> 04:03.350
Gibsons was across the street, you know, over there on 6th.

04:03.370 --> 04:04.391
Red materials.

04:04.631 --> 04:05.252
Yeah, exactly.

04:06.133 --> 04:08.695
We didn't have academies or all those things in those days.

04:09.476 --> 04:13.660
There was a clothing store downtown, I went down and bought a suit downtown for the job interviews.

04:13.740 --> 04:14.300
Waldrop's.

04:15.541 --> 04:18.424
Down in Bryan, probably was.

04:19.518 --> 04:21.802
Now, how often did you go down to Bryan?

04:21.822 --> 04:23.404
Not very often.

04:23.424 --> 04:25.487
Didn't have much reason to.

04:25.527 --> 04:29.574
My last couple of years, I was running tracks to and from Houston a lot.

04:29.594 --> 04:31.557
That's where my girlfriend lives.

04:33.420 --> 04:35.803
Let's see, and you didn't ride the bus much or the train?

04:36.284 --> 04:40.250
No, never rode the train, never rode the bus.

04:40.270 --> 04:44.597
Were there any national or international events

04:45.488 --> 04:49.773
that you remember as seeming very important to you while you were an undergraduate?

04:49.893 --> 04:58.844
Did anything happen off campus that... Well, Vietnam was certainly on our minds.

04:59.886 --> 05:00.947
Did you all talk about that?

05:01.127 --> 05:02.749
Oh yeah, we sure did.

05:05.192 --> 05:07.535
Had we not been in college, we would have been drafted.

05:07.575 --> 05:08.376
We all knew that.

05:09.417 --> 05:11.800
We knew most of us were going to be commissioned.

05:12.370 --> 05:14.453
In those days, most of us had contracts.

05:14.893 --> 05:19.319
There were a few DNC, but not that many.

05:19.339 --> 05:25.186
We pretty much assumed that that's where we would go, hoping like, heck, it wouldn't happen.

05:25.206 --> 05:31.715
By then, we had heard of two or three people who we knew that died in Vietnam.

05:31.735 --> 05:36.080
There was one fellow, he was a wing commander, his name was Butch Balridge.

05:36.100 --> 05:37.382
He was one, he was a

05:38.527 --> 05:43.716
He was shot down over there and the word got around that he was shot down and I'm not sure he was ever found.

05:43.736 --> 05:48.865
Did you all have any tack officers or anybody else in the Corps that had been to Vietnam and come back?

05:49.126 --> 05:52.732
Yeah, we had a captain, fellas, I think his name was Briscoe.

05:52.752 --> 05:57.320
He was a military science instructor.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.224
I think he had been back.

05:59.765 --> 06:02.830
He was an airborne ranger and all that stuff, so I'm pretty sure he had been.

06:03.451 --> 06:13.004
And there were no big-time Washington or Hollywood personalities that came to the campus.

06:19.312 --> 06:22.517
What were the most popular student indulgences of the time?

06:22.597 --> 06:26.622
If students were going to kick over the traces on a Saturday night, what did they do?

06:26.642 --> 06:26.863
Beer.

06:27.343 --> 06:31.669
Where'd you get it?

06:31.902 --> 06:34.204
We used to have a beer bust a couple times a year.

06:34.244 --> 06:41.692
We'd have it out on the Brazos and it was an outfit beer bust and somebody who was 21 would go get it.

06:41.712 --> 06:48.820
We used my pickup, my old pickup to haul most of that stuff around.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.902
Where on the Brazos would the party be held?

06:54.226 --> 06:56.408
If I recall...

06:56.894 --> 06:59.458
We'd take 21 out like we're going to Caldwell.

07:00.399 --> 07:03.364
And somewhere where that railroad bridge is, we'd turn in there.

07:04.005 --> 07:07.611
And usually there was some farmer or whatever to let us use this riverfront.

07:07.631 --> 07:10.075
And was this a male and female party?

07:10.215 --> 07:12.218
No, it was just the outfit.

07:12.278 --> 07:12.699
Just guys.

07:12.719 --> 07:14.802
You wouldn't think of having any girl there.

07:15.035 --> 07:23.525
Was anybody appropriately cautious about having a driver that had not consumed much?

07:23.545 --> 07:25.387
I hate to say it, but probably not.

07:26.728 --> 07:28.270
This would be just the outfit?

07:28.290 --> 07:28.711
Just the outfit.

07:29.131 --> 07:29.932
Were fish?

07:30.413 --> 07:31.874
Yeah, it was all classes.

07:31.894 --> 07:34.317
It would be all classes.

07:34.537 --> 07:37.301
And was there any particular timing of these?

07:37.321 --> 07:39.063
It seemed to me they were in the spring.

07:40.144 --> 07:43.328
But it wasn't the week before or the week after something?

07:43.448 --> 07:43.708
No.

07:43.958 --> 07:45.720
So-and-so got engaged?

07:46.061 --> 07:47.142
No, not that I remember.

07:47.162 --> 07:49.205
And about when would it begin and end?

07:49.425 --> 07:55.973
Usually on Saturday afternoon, probably start mid-afternoon and end up before dark.

07:56.233 --> 07:56.994
Oh, before dark?

07:57.054 --> 07:57.375
Yes.

07:57.535 --> 07:59.677
I always remember getting back before dark.

08:00.378 --> 08:01.600
Whiskey Bridge?

08:01.620 --> 08:05.024
Whiskey Bridge was still there when I was there.

08:05.064 --> 08:09.069
It was gone by the time I was 21 because when I was 21 you could buy it there.

08:10.311 --> 08:12.193
But if there was a

08:14.148 --> 08:22.082
court trip or football weekend and you wanted something, an upperclassman would go get it for you.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.006
By the time I was 21 it wasn't there anymore.

08:24.386 --> 08:33.824
Were there any places in Bryan that you knew of that sold hard liquor under the table or around the door?

08:34.865 --> 08:36.629
I haven't heard of any.

08:36.649 --> 08:38.552
Was hard lickers gone by that time?

08:39.292 --> 08:41.755
I've heard of it, but it wasn't there when I was there.

08:41.775 --> 08:43.237
What was it?

08:43.257 --> 08:47.922
It was a place down south on Welburn Road where you could buy beer.

08:50.305 --> 08:52.648
And it was gone by the time I got there in 59.

08:52.808 --> 08:59.296
It was run by a man whose name was H-Y-R-D-L-I-C-K, a good check name.

08:59.556 --> 09:03.561
It should be H-Y-R-D-L-I-C-K, but pronounced Hard Liquors.

09:03.777 --> 09:10.763
There was an old timer that asked me about that, a good friend of mine, class of 40, he knew about it, but I'd never heard of it.

09:10.783 --> 09:16.167
All right, so beer, whiskey, what other alcoholic beverages did many people drink?

09:16.568 --> 09:17.469
That was it.

09:17.489 --> 09:17.749
Okay.

09:18.690 --> 09:20.551
What other indulgences?

09:20.972 --> 09:21.552
Tobacco?

09:22.553 --> 09:26.736
Oh, I guess we all smoked a little bit of cigarettes or cigars or whatever.

09:26.796 --> 09:31.240
We had a lot of guys who dipped and chewed.

09:31.781 --> 09:33.362
Some still do, some still quit.

09:34.034 --> 09:41.904
You compare, I guess what's available today to what was available then, there's no comparison.

09:41.924 --> 09:47.932
Did you and your buddies even know the words of marijuana, cocaine?

09:48.373 --> 09:50.956
I'd heard of it but I wouldn't know it if you put it in my face.

09:50.976 --> 09:55.862
Did you ever hear of anybody on campus using any of that while you were a student?

09:55.882 --> 10:02.691
After I was gone I heard of some people that said they used it when they were on campus or I was told they did.

10:03.076 --> 10:05.921
I was never aware of it.

10:05.941 --> 10:07.704
Alright, let's go back to football.

10:08.325 --> 10:10.889
A football weekend in college station.

10:12.031 --> 10:19.284
When did the activities begin that were part of that whole... Friday afternoon since the last class was over.

10:20.165 --> 10:22.249
Generally by then you're...

10:23.444 --> 10:28.852
date or girlfriend was beginning to show up or would show up sometime in the early evening.

10:29.813 --> 10:34.400
And, you know, we'd usually, for those things, like I said earlier, you had some sort of a town hall.

10:35.281 --> 10:40.709
And if there was a campus function like a town hall or whatever, we went to them.

10:42.692 --> 10:47.279
I don't know if we thought we were supposed to or it just wasn't anything else to do or we liked them.

10:47.299 --> 10:48.661
But I remember going and enjoying.

10:48.681 --> 10:51.325
It was kind of a big deal, you know.

10:51.811 --> 10:57.418
Then you'd have your march in on Saturday.

10:57.478 --> 10:59.060
Wait, wait, wait.

10:59.140 --> 10:59.581
What happened?

10:59.621 --> 11:00.802
I'm sorry, midnight yellow practice.

11:00.822 --> 11:01.663
Yeah, yeah.

11:01.683 --> 11:02.284
Describe that.

11:03.085 --> 11:03.365
Well.

11:04.847 --> 11:05.348
What'd you wear?

11:05.428 --> 11:12.196
First when I went to, I think I just wore a pair of those fatigue pants and a t-shirt.

11:12.997 --> 11:16.101
And I think as fish, we wore a combat boots or something.

11:16.422 --> 11:19.185
Our XO got us out in the quad, and I think he was drunk.

11:20.178 --> 11:25.843
And he was telling us all about what men at Yale practice is and lock your arms and stay together and all this kind of stuff.

11:25.863 --> 11:27.384
Boy, man, this is going to be violent.

11:27.544 --> 11:29.566
You know, this is going to be rough.

11:29.666 --> 11:31.027
Well, we had a good time.

11:33.249 --> 11:36.632
It was great, you know.

11:37.232 --> 11:39.674
And it started about when?

11:39.695 --> 11:41.276
We left the quad about 1130.

11:42.617 --> 11:43.698
We left from the quad.

11:43.858 --> 11:47.101
We'd march, say march, we'd go as groups from the quad.

11:47.601 --> 11:49.763
The band would come through there and then you'd follow the band.

11:50.333 --> 11:52.035
Now everybody kind of just goes over there.

11:52.956 --> 11:55.038
And you took your dates.

11:55.419 --> 11:55.659
Yes, sir.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.020
Yeah, lucky enough to have one.

11:57.040 --> 11:57.281
All right.

11:57.461 --> 11:58.742
And it was over about when?

11:59.523 --> 12:00.044
1230.

12:00.624 --> 12:01.465
Didn't last all that long.

12:01.726 --> 12:07.692
Do you remember anything, any bad conduct at midnight yell practices?

12:07.712 --> 12:11.817
No, everybody was kind of rowdy and frisky, but I don't remember anything that was harmful.

12:11.837 --> 12:13.779
I don't remember anybody ever getting hurt.

12:13.799 --> 12:16.442
And the fables were of what nature?

12:16.726 --> 12:20.932
They were pretty graphic.

12:20.952 --> 12:21.914
They were pretty graphic.

12:22.855 --> 12:23.957
Things you couldn't do today.

12:24.738 --> 12:26.020
Things you shouldn't have done then.

12:26.280 --> 12:28.684
Alright then, Saturday morning, when did things begin?

12:29.785 --> 12:33.771
Well, probably mid morning, noon time.

12:34.212 --> 12:36.355
We were usually always out late the night before.

12:39.380 --> 12:44.387
We had a lot of night games in those days.

12:45.025 --> 12:48.250
So your march in might not begin until 5 o'clock.

12:50.153 --> 12:55.280
So you'd have lunch with your date or whatever bum around and get ready for the game.

12:55.300 --> 12:58.665
She'd have to go back to where she'd stay and get all dressed up.

12:58.685 --> 13:01.750
Because the girls went to the games dressed up.

13:01.770 --> 13:03.072
And we wore uniforms.

13:03.733 --> 13:05.275
The girls wore nice dresses.

13:07.418 --> 13:10.183
Nobody wore shorts and things like they do today.

13:10.984 --> 13:12.967
And I'm not saying anything wrong with that.

13:13.007 --> 13:13.868
We just didn't do it that way.

13:14.202 --> 13:16.765
If your parents came up, your dad was in a suit.

13:17.646 --> 13:19.909
And my dad didn't even wear a suit to work.

13:19.929 --> 13:21.030
I mean, he was a machinist.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.614
But if he came to A&M for a football game, he wore a suit.

13:24.715 --> 13:27.619
Like going to church.

13:27.639 --> 13:32.565
All right, then you and your unit marched in.

13:33.246 --> 13:33.426
Yes, sir.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.028
Where did you leave your date?

13:35.769 --> 13:37.451
They'd have a ticket going to the stands.

13:38.292 --> 13:40.154
Would she normally come to the quad?

13:40.655 --> 13:40.935
Oh, yeah.

13:41.438 --> 13:45.463
The girls, the families would all come to the quad just like they do today.

13:45.803 --> 13:53.853
And they would follow us or walk alongside of us until we got to where we were going into Kyle Field.

13:54.394 --> 14:00.301
At that point they'd peel off and go into the seats and then after it was over we'd meet up there.

14:00.321 --> 14:01.542
We never missed a football game.

14:02.043 --> 14:10.433
Are there any, that 10-7 game, any other games that you remember with great, great either joy or sadness as an Aggie fan?

14:11.054 --> 14:15.500
Probably one of the saddest games we ever had, but we played rice at home when I was a senior.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.622
It was a cold, miserable, nasty day.

14:19.124 --> 14:21.127
And they beat the fool out of us.

14:21.147 --> 14:27.515
And that was our last, wait a minute, was that our last home game?

14:27.535 --> 14:29.698
Yeah, last home game as a student.

14:30.119 --> 14:35.586
And it was cold, it was wet, and we got beat.

14:36.006 --> 14:38.209
We were terrible, terrible.

14:39.944 --> 14:42.709
Let's see, we've done, alright.

14:45.153 --> 14:47.978
Final review, you said family came.

14:50.963 --> 14:53.587
What kind of world did you think you were about to enter?

14:55.210 --> 14:57.734
Well I was ready to get out and go to work.

14:58.936 --> 15:03.083
I wasn't sure what I was going to be doing.

15:03.468 --> 15:11.076
I'd interviewed with a lot of companies there on campus and was invited to visit some and never got a job offer.

15:11.096 --> 15:16.502
Anyway, I was just ready to get out and I was wanting to get into the business world.

15:16.522 --> 15:23.310
I'd grown up in a blue collar area and I didn't want to do that.

15:23.630 --> 15:26.794
I thought if I had an office and a suit, you know, you had arrived.

15:27.455 --> 15:31.399
I'm not so sure that's really the case, but looking back,

15:32.155 --> 15:35.398
How well did the A&M experience prepare you for the real world?

15:35.499 --> 15:38.221
I think pretty well.

15:38.242 --> 15:42.947
What were the ingredients in that preparation that have proven to be important?

15:43.787 --> 15:46.430
Well, hard to say.

15:48.573 --> 16:00.205
I was a mediocre student and I had to work a lot harder to get a C or V than maybe a lot of guys had to do to get an A. Work never bothered me.

16:00.725 --> 16:05.650
Even as a kid before I got to A&M working at the department.

16:05.670 --> 16:07.332
I think the ability to meet people.

16:09.314 --> 16:11.076
The core forced me to meet people.

16:12.238 --> 16:16.062
The core forced me to make friends.

16:17.383 --> 16:22.669
Had I gone to high school with all these guys, I probably would have barely known them.

16:22.689 --> 16:25.332
But take the same bunch and put them at A&M.

16:25.352 --> 16:29.837
In high school, I was just an average Joe Blow, everyday kid.

16:30.593 --> 16:32.415
Not too involved.

16:33.236 --> 16:34.898
Just went to school.

16:34.918 --> 16:40.906
And at A&M, you couldn't be that way.

16:40.926 --> 16:42.568
You just couldn't be that way.

16:42.588 --> 16:44.691
Did getting the ring mean anything important to you?

16:44.711 --> 16:45.412
No, that's a big deal.

16:45.432 --> 16:46.954
I'll tell you that ring story.

16:46.974 --> 16:47.935
Yeah, it did.

16:49.457 --> 16:58.689
My best friend, Steve Hughes, and I were at Camp Eagle at Fort Sill for summer camp.

16:58.709 --> 16:59.790
Army summer camp.

17:02.133 --> 17:06.176
So last day, I had the car up there, he didn't.

17:06.557 --> 17:10.760
Camp's over, we're all packing our stuff up, loading our cars up.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.222
He and I were gonna ride back together.

17:14.223 --> 17:16.485
So the traffic was terrible.

17:16.745 --> 17:19.888
He was in one section of the camp, I was in the other.

17:19.908 --> 17:22.490
So I was leaving mine, the traffic was all backed up.

17:22.510 --> 17:24.212
And I finally got over there to pick up Steven.

17:24.232 --> 17:26.434
He was the last guy sitting on the street.

17:26.454 --> 17:27.855
He thought I'd blown him off and left.

17:29.456 --> 17:31.718
Which I wouldn't have done, but I'm glad he thought that anyway.

17:32.643 --> 17:40.094
So our mission was to drive to College Station to get our rings, and this was 9 o'clock in the morning or 8 o'clock in the morning or whatever.

17:41.096 --> 18:02.127
So we'd make a beeline from Fort Sill directly to College Station, go to the registrar's office, which is where they used to get the rings, walked in there, and here we are, red-skinned from the red sand of Oklahoma and probably looked like Indians, walked in and said,

18:02.900 --> 18:03.301
We're here.

18:03.321 --> 18:04.262
We like to pick up our ring.

18:04.282 --> 18:05.864
Sir, the ring off is closed at noon.

18:05.884 --> 18:12.173
He said, well, we just drove straight here from Fort Sill to get our rings.

18:12.313 --> 18:13.615
I'm going to Houston.

18:13.635 --> 18:15.738
He's going to San Antonio.

18:15.758 --> 18:18.361
And can't you do something for him?

18:18.381 --> 18:19.062
Well, it was a minute.

18:19.082 --> 18:21.906
So anyway, goes back in the back, gets a lady, unlocks the safe.

18:22.347 --> 18:24.229
We go in with her, and that's why we got our rings.

18:24.249 --> 18:25.291
Oh, that's good.

18:25.411 --> 18:26.773
Do you remember who that was by now?

18:26.993 --> 18:27.233
No, I don't.

18:27.253 --> 18:27.634
Not sure.

18:28.695 --> 18:29.937
So that would have been the summer of 70?

18:30.518 --> 18:32.080
Summer of 70.

18:32.752 --> 18:36.538
You never have lost the ring or anything?

18:36.578 --> 18:36.638
No.

18:36.738 --> 18:37.679
How often do you take it off?

18:37.699 --> 18:39.262
Never.

18:39.862 --> 18:40.684
Very seldom.

18:40.704 --> 18:43.588
I mean, I don't know when I take it off.

18:43.608 --> 18:47.894
What are the ingredients that create Aggie spirit?

18:53.623 --> 18:54.263
I don't know how to answer that.

18:54.283 --> 18:59.451
It's an overused term, but I guess camaraderie ship.

19:00.933 --> 19:11.266
The friendships you made, the... I don't know.

19:11.286 --> 19:15.571
Not only do you get to know the people you went to school with, you know their parents.

19:16.973 --> 19:18.375
You get to know their wives.

19:18.795 --> 19:21.499
You get to know all their kids.

19:21.859 --> 19:22.720
It's a big family.

19:22.840 --> 19:25.824
I don't know exactly how to define the spirit.

19:26.305 --> 19:30.670
If somebody was saying, we're going to eliminate certain events,

19:31.713 --> 19:35.158
Which ones would you say, no, no, no, those are essential.

19:36.039 --> 19:37.201
We don't want to do away with.

19:38.983 --> 19:44.210
Well, mustard is our most important tradition, I would say.

19:44.230 --> 19:45.011
Silver taps.

19:47.314 --> 19:56.928
Help me out with some of the others, but if you're in the core of the core trips, those are the types of things that kind of bond people together.

19:56.948 --> 19:57.749
Bonfire.

19:58.450 --> 19:59.992
Yeah, bonfire.

20:00.012 --> 20:01.534
Midnight yell practice.

20:02.155 --> 20:08.804
Some of these things, like midnight yoga practice and all that, I feel maybe I've kind of outgrown that, but I still go.

20:12.890 --> 20:20.421
See, as I think of these, some of them are serious, serious, but some of them at the time are kind of lighthearted.

20:22.204 --> 20:25.328
But it's like there are certain times when you and I are supposed to chuckle,

20:25.865 --> 20:27.828
and other times when they're supposed to be darn serious.

20:28.368 --> 20:30.531
And I see that as kind of the same thing.

20:33.015 --> 20:34.597
I think it's really important.

20:34.617 --> 20:42.527
It's not an event particularly, but the Corps has struggled for the last several years to maintain its numbers and to get growth.

20:42.628 --> 20:50.939
And I don't know how to keep that up, but I think it's really important that it continue and hopefully it will grow.

20:51.039 --> 20:52.581
One that I almost overlooked.

20:53.422 --> 20:55.465
diversity of the student body.

20:57.908 --> 20:59.450
Were there some non-Anglos?

21:00.251 --> 21:01.332
A few, but not very many.

21:02.614 --> 21:03.535
How were they treated?

21:04.437 --> 21:06.319
As well as anybody.

21:06.339 --> 21:15.731
Do you remember any particular nicknames that a politically correct person would have identified as?

21:17.474 --> 21:18.455
No, I don't.

21:18.475 --> 21:19.176
You don't remember?

21:19.510 --> 21:25.238
Anybody Jewish or Catholic or Hispanic or black being identified by any particular?

21:25.739 --> 21:27.521
I don't.

21:27.861 --> 21:28.022
I don't.

21:28.202 --> 21:28.743
I had to go up.

21:29.464 --> 21:37.875
I had a, well, Larry Levine up here.

21:38.316 --> 21:39.277
Big Jewish guy.

21:39.958 --> 21:41.340
Good friend of mine.

21:41.360 --> 21:43.883
Big real estate guy in Houston.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.547
That kind of stuff never crossed my mind.

21:47.135 --> 21:48.236
That's the impression I have.

21:48.356 --> 21:55.125
And I'm not saying I'm so good or any of that, but it didn't make any difference to me.

21:55.145 --> 21:58.749
I may not even know he was a Jewish at the time, to tell you the truth.

21:58.769 --> 22:03.635
Or if Thibodeau was a Cajun, or I grew up with all those kind of people.

22:05.077 --> 22:08.621
We had a couple of blacks in the court.

22:09.021 --> 22:10.423
How were they treated?

22:10.443 --> 22:12.906
Just like everybody else, to my knowledge.

22:13.814 --> 22:22.044
If anybody was ever harassed or picked on, either upper class or under class because of their color or their ethnic background or anything, I wasn't aware of it.

22:22.845 --> 22:24.147
I didn't hear of any at that time.

22:26.710 --> 22:29.513
Let's see, you said you knew Hector?

22:29.553 --> 22:30.014
Hector.

22:32.157 --> 22:34.339
Why was he picked as corps commander, do you think?

22:34.500 --> 22:37.623
He picked because he was qualified.

22:37.643 --> 22:38.605
That's what he thinks too.

22:38.765 --> 22:41.408
I don't think there's any doubt about it.

22:42.316 --> 22:50.166
Let's see, oh, not asking if you were a part of, did you ever hear of any secret fraternities?

22:52.169 --> 22:52.389
Never did.

22:52.409 --> 22:57.576
I have lately, but I never heard of them when I was in school.

22:57.596 --> 23:00.820
I'm getting very, on that question, I'm getting very different interests.

23:00.840 --> 23:08.290
Some are saying exactly what you are, then others, with the look on their face, it gives me the impression they might know a great deal more than they are willing to share.

23:08.995 --> 23:12.559
And I've tried to say, you know, share with me whatever you can.

23:12.599 --> 23:15.101
Okay, we're... Now this question came up a few years ago.

23:15.141 --> 23:22.469
My kids asked me if I had ever heard of them in, what do they call them, I guess, secret organizations.

23:22.969 --> 23:24.090
And honestly, I have.

23:24.110 --> 23:25.612
I didn't hear about them when I was there.

23:26.393 --> 23:30.337
So if they're there, they're certainly kept quiet.

23:32.098 --> 23:32.579
Let's see.

23:32.599 --> 23:34.581
Have I...

23:34.983 --> 23:39.749
left out anything that you particularly wanted to share as you thought about this?

23:41.711 --> 23:42.652
I don't think so.

23:42.672 --> 23:45.335
I was concerned about what you're going to ask me about having the answers for it.

23:46.096 --> 23:48.739
Alright, so let's try to sum it up.

23:49.620 --> 23:51.262
What did it mean to you?

23:51.443 --> 23:53.625
What has it meant to you that you went to A&M?

23:54.346 --> 23:55.888
What effect has it had on your life?

23:56.909 --> 24:01.014
It either changed my life or made my life.

24:01.034 --> 24:03.657
I'm not sure how to

24:05.088 --> 24:11.959
put it into words, but in the, I was very lucky.

24:12.059 --> 24:22.956
In the environment I grew up in was all, we lived right in the middle of the refineries down in Portland, a good place to grow up, you know, a good place to be a kid.

24:22.976 --> 24:25.941
You couldn't get in too much trouble.

24:25.961 --> 24:32.631
And if you did something wrong, your neighbor down the street is going to call your house and they're going to go about it before you get home.

24:34.079 --> 24:38.405
I had not seen anything other than that.

24:38.425 --> 24:47.759
And I was very lucky that my uncle just picked me up and said, this is where you're going to go and I'm going to take care of it.

24:47.779 --> 24:50.724
He had no children and I was named after him.

24:51.525 --> 24:52.527
That's luck.

24:53.628 --> 24:55.271
Somebody like that really loves you.

24:55.631 --> 24:58.916
That doesn't happen that often.

24:58.936 --> 25:02.922
So I got to A&M and got to meet

25:03.965 --> 25:11.956
Most of the kids I met were in a higher economic class than what I came from.

25:11.976 --> 25:12.496
And I knew that.

25:13.538 --> 25:23.692
And you'd get to go to their homes, and I'd go to somebody's home who, I'd go look at it today, it's a modest home.

25:23.712 --> 25:24.593
I thought they were rich.

25:25.634 --> 25:29.419
Their daddy worked for Kelly, had a civil service job, lived right over here on my captain.

25:29.439 --> 25:30.941
These people are wealthy.

25:30.961 --> 25:33.685
They weren't, they're just working people, you know.

25:34.458 --> 25:44.767
And I don't know, maybe I guess hopefully set my sights up a little bit because I knew what I wanted to do long term.

25:44.847 --> 25:47.029
I didn't have all the details worked out in my mind.

25:47.049 --> 25:48.911
I probably still don't.

25:48.931 --> 25:51.694
But I want to own a nice home and have a nice wife and kids.

25:51.714 --> 25:53.495
That's kind of how it's going.

25:53.515 --> 25:54.837
I've just been lucky.

25:55.457 --> 26:00.642
Without a degree from A&M, I wouldn't have met after I got out the people that I've met.

26:01.162 --> 26:03.064
It wasn't all those folks we just had lunch with.

26:03.719 --> 26:08.927
I wouldn't have met Mr. Grona, who basically helped me get set up in the business.

26:08.947 --> 26:10.269
All those types of things.

26:10.289 --> 26:22.268
So, I don't know what life would be like had that not occurred.

26:24.037 --> 26:33.005
the chance of getting involved in the former students association through the local club here and so on, that's something I never thought Hespa would ever come my way.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.667
So what feelings do you hold in your heart for you now?

26:35.687 --> 26:37.489
Oh, everything.

26:37.509 --> 26:39.190
That's very, very dear to me.

26:39.651 --> 26:41.632
Very, very near and dear to me.

26:41.652 --> 26:43.074
I'd do anything for the school that I could.

26:44.355 --> 26:53.723
That's why I, when I was asked last year if I'd served as the president-elect of the association, I have a

26:54.091 --> 26:57.475
Frankly, I have no desire to be particularly well-known.

26:57.735 --> 26:58.856
I don't have a big ego.

26:58.956 --> 27:03.461
I'm a terrible speech maker, as you can tell from just listening to me talk.

27:03.481 --> 27:06.444
I'll learn, I'll get better, you know, before I get into all that.

27:06.584 --> 27:19.237
But for what A&M did for me, we paid for it and all, but, you know, for what A&M did for me and what it's done for my kids, I'll do anything that I can.

27:19.257 --> 27:20.539
And I'll allow the time.

27:20.619 --> 27:21.820
I'll make it work.
