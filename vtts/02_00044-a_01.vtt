WEBVTT

00:02.815 --> 00:05.367
Testing for a third time on July the 19th.

00:07.558 --> 00:09.045
Okay, doing a sound check.

00:11.168 --> 00:18.257
This is July the 19th, and I have the pleasure and honor of chatting today with Benton Kokenauer, the dean of business.

00:20.099 --> 00:28.811
To begin with, to introduce yourself to someone that might read this or listen to it in the years in the future.

00:29.512 --> 00:34.999
Describe growing up, where, where'd you go to high school, parents' occupation, and so forth.

00:35.699 --> 00:37.682
Introduce yourself to this tape, please.

00:37.662 --> 00:38.083
Sure.

00:38.724 --> 00:40.126
I'm a native Texan.

00:41.348 --> 00:47.940
I was born, I lived in the Lubbock area until I was 13.

00:47.960 --> 00:52.928
Then we moved to the cultural center in north central Texas, Wichita Falls.

00:54.791 --> 00:57.756
My parents are business people.

00:57.837 --> 01:03.366
My dad was in the

01:03.346 --> 01:07.833
various businesses in Wichita Falls.

01:09.074 --> 01:17.006
Managed a large shopping center there and my mother worked for an oil distributor.

01:19.169 --> 01:22.654
Went to finished high school in Wichita Falls.

01:22.955 --> 01:50.363
went to the University of Oklahoma for two years, then transferred to the University of Texas, and got an undergraduate degree, and was commissioned in the Army, and served for two years, then went to work for GE, and worked for GE for a little over five years, and took a leave of absence, and came back to the University of Texas, and entered the PhD program, actually picked up a master's degree en route,

01:50.343 --> 01:53.734
Got my master's in business administration.

01:54.838 --> 01:59.172
My undergraduate degree was in finance and accounting.

01:59.895 --> 02:03.306
Got my MBA and PhD in marketing.

02:06.442 --> 02:08.725
Okay, then first academics.

02:09.046 --> 02:27.673
Okay, first academic, actually I stayed on the University of Texas for a year on the faculty that had some people go and leave and asked me to stay and then I took a faculty appointment at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles and was there three years and

02:28.143 --> 02:40.306
Then accepted an offer at the University of Houston and was there 13 years and came from there to Texas A&M.

02:41.508 --> 02:46.337
Don't I remember A&M trying to recruit you before you came up here?

02:46.874 --> 02:59.753
Well, I think, you know, we had had some discussions off and on for a while and then, of course, I knew some of the people here and then

03:00.813 --> 03:09.964
Also, as an administrator at the University of Houston, I recall that you and I met at a couple of meetings, as I recall.

03:09.984 --> 03:22.419
And, of course, at the University of Houston, I was dean of the business school for nine years and then was the executive vice president and provost there for two and a half years before coming to A&M.

03:22.940 --> 03:23.180
All right.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.762
And you came to A&M what year?

03:24.742 --> 03:27.365
1987, July of 87.

03:28.646 --> 03:32.311
And what was it that attracted you here?

03:32.431 --> 03:33.272
Why A&M?

03:34.413 --> 03:41.822
Well, by the time I came to A&M, you know, its future direction was clearly set.

03:41.882 --> 03:48.569
I have a lot of admiration for the people that helped change the very fabric of this university.

03:49.130 --> 03:53.635
And having seen it from something of a distance, it really was dramatic.

03:54.070 --> 03:55.973
what had happened.

03:56.013 --> 04:12.636
You know, frankly, A&M was not a university that I probably would have given much thought to at the time that I got my PhD and was really looking for career opportunities, but by

04:12.970 --> 04:35.468
certainly by the the mid 80s it was clear to everyone that this was a university that was uh had made some really remarkable changes and and what its aspiration levels were and and the role that it saw itself playing in the future and and and really was establishing itself uh

04:35.448 --> 04:38.773
as a flagship university.

04:39.174 --> 04:54.717
Now obviously by designation the Permanent University Fund, by definition it may have been a flagship university, but it had changed its philosophy and its approach to fulfill that legacy.

04:54.737 --> 05:00.105
In business, what were some of the hallmarks of that progress before you came?

05:00.524 --> 05:17.151
Well, certainly there were, there was a core of really highly competent faculty, and many of those, to the credit of the institution, had come here very early in their career and developed into outstanding faculty.

05:17.231 --> 05:24.102
I mean, people like Don Hellriegel, Bob Strausser, and

05:24.082 --> 05:40.977
later of people like Lynn Berry and really I could name any number of people that I knew well had a lot of respect for and certainly it was a lot of

05:40.957 --> 05:48.289
raw material and still not fully fulfilled potential was in place.

05:51.153 --> 05:53.297
But it was a very attractive situation.

05:53.337 --> 06:04.855
I felt like from a career standpoint and that it was clearly a university committed to becoming a nationally leading university.

06:05.223 --> 06:12.973
The regents expressed really strong support to me personally that they wanted a strong business program.

06:13.113 --> 06:27.491
The university administration indicated that they were pleased at the development of the business programs, but wanted us to really move them into the forefront.

06:27.531 --> 06:29.774
And that was an exciting potential.

06:30.355 --> 06:32.277
As you were considering

06:32.695 --> 06:40.225
Did some regents, did you chat with some regents?

06:40.762 --> 06:41.483
I did.

06:41.603 --> 06:46.347
Some were involved in the search process.

06:46.768 --> 06:56.898
Also talked to some of the external people involved with the college, and then, of course, had an opportunity to talk to the administration.

06:57.458 --> 06:58.339
Who was?

06:58.699 --> 07:09.790
Vandiver was president, and Frank was... I was...

07:09.770 --> 07:25.480
Very impressed with the sincerity that he conveyed and that he thought that, you know, it was clearly an area that he didn't have much personal experience or involvement in, but that he felt like it was important to the future of Texas A&M.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.285
As his first doctoral student, I know him fairly well.

07:28.265 --> 07:34.433
Who was the, I guess then wasn't yet called provost, who was the chief academic officer?

07:34.493 --> 07:38.819
Chief academic officer was Donald McDonnell.

07:38.839 --> 07:42.044
And he came out of business, didn't he?

07:42.064 --> 07:43.105
No, he was an engineer.

07:43.365 --> 07:44.247
Oh, that's right, that's right.

07:45.288 --> 07:48.172
Of course, I had known Bill Mobley for a number of years.

07:48.292 --> 07:50.475
Bill was the deputy chancellor.

07:50.455 --> 08:18.808
at the time and it was the former business school dean and Bill was really very influential and he was one time just in passing I had mentioned to Bill at that time he had just taken the deputy chancellor and I was the the provost at the University of Houston I had mentioned to Bill that really of the jobs I'd had that I'd really decided I was not

08:18.890 --> 08:21.234
that interest in being a university president.

08:21.895 --> 08:25.562
Jobs I had, I really thought the most fun job was being a business school dean.

08:25.662 --> 08:33.676
And so when this job opened up and Bill moved, he called one day and said, how serious were you about that?

08:33.756 --> 08:35.179
And it kind of started from there.

08:35.900 --> 08:38.425
All right, now this is the only question I'm going to ask about money.

08:38.945 --> 08:40.408
What was the beginning salary?

08:40.895 --> 08:47.209
The beginning salary, as I recall, I think it was $125,000.

08:48.091 --> 08:51.378
How competitive was that in the real world then?

08:51.559 --> 08:54.726
At the time, it was competitive.

08:56.630 --> 09:00.338
You know, certainly salaries have gone up quite a bit since then.

09:00.723 --> 09:07.410
And certainly compared to the dean's jobs at A&M, I felt good about it.

09:07.430 --> 09:10.753
I think that, you know, I did not feel like I was being overpaid.

09:10.833 --> 09:12.074
I don't guess we ever do.

09:12.175 --> 09:21.564
But I felt like that they were making a pretty clear signal that it was something that they placed importance in and that they were interested in having me come here.

09:22.024 --> 09:30.493
Did anyone give you a kind of guidance, advice, counsel?

09:30.862 --> 09:32.304
Did they set some goals for you?

09:33.545 --> 09:55.390
Well, it probably helped that I'd had so much administrative experience by then and was at that time, you know, 48 years old and been an administrator since pretty early as well as having the experience with GE, which was an incredibly useful experience.

09:55.410 --> 09:59.755
But, you know, I think one of the strengths that I have is that

10:00.258 --> 10:19.077
uh i i try to get advice anywhere i can uh you know you always have the the right to evaluate it and accept it or not accept it but uh you know i i had the benefit of a lot of valuable input bill mobley was was certainly very helpful don hellriegel who

10:19.462 --> 10:30.092
I really think a lot of personally had been the interim dean and was very helpful in kind of giving me a good feel for the situation.

10:30.112 --> 10:37.118
But, you know, some of the regents provided some insights just on a personal basis.

10:37.819 --> 10:38.399
Who were they?

10:38.619 --> 10:39.540
Which regents?

10:39.660 --> 10:45.326
Well, you know, John Mobley and Lowry Mays.

10:45.606 --> 10:46.887
Certainly I got to know

10:47.153 --> 10:55.324
very early on, and Royce Weisenbaker was, you know,

10:56.047 --> 11:01.434
Royce apparently either liked you or didn't like you, and there was not much in between.

11:01.494 --> 11:14.091
And I've always felt very fortunate that, for whatever reason, he was very generous with me in terms of the relationship that we had.

11:14.591 --> 11:19.278
When you arrived, describe the college as you found it.

11:20.479 --> 11:21.420
Where was it?

11:21.921 --> 11:22.662
What was there?

11:22.642 --> 11:26.446
Yeah, the college was one of the tenants in the blocker building.

11:28.969 --> 11:35.016
Frankly, coming in the blocker building was fairly unimpressive for me.

11:35.056 --> 11:48.531
It certainly was not a facility that I thought placed us very well with some of the peer schools or some of the aspiration level schools.

11:49.017 --> 11:55.585
that we had and certainly was not very efficient space for a college-like business.

11:56.105 --> 12:05.473
But what I found interesting was that people had been around a number of years thought Blocker was a great step up from what they had previously had.

12:07.015 --> 12:20.507
So I considered it a big step for us when we were able to make the case for new facilities as some time went on, because I thought it was an important step for the business program.

12:21.027 --> 12:26.112
And what did you find as you looked at the faculty and the department heads and so forth?

12:26.092 --> 12:33.216
I was really, very pleasantly surprised in that regard.

12:33.601 --> 12:41.891
I thought that there was a consistently quality faculty.

12:41.911 --> 12:44.515
There were some areas I thought we needed to strengthen.

12:44.815 --> 12:45.396
Such as?

12:45.796 --> 12:59.153
Yeah, and one of the things that I did, and it's kind of my style, was to try to lay out some areas and get some common agreement on those of areas that

12:59.673 --> 13:03.457
that we really needed to focus some special attention on.

13:03.938 --> 13:15.790
And at that time, management information systems, international business, and strategic management.

13:15.890 --> 13:26.862
That if we were going to be a top 50 ranked business program, then those were areas that clearly we had to have some demonstrated

13:27.449 --> 13:28.551
national level.

13:28.911 --> 13:31.114
About where did A&M rank then?

13:31.735 --> 13:43.513
Well, A&M was really better than its ranking, but at that time essentially A&M didn't rank at all.

13:44.314 --> 13:54.469
At the time there were certainly fewer rankings than there are now, but it was disappointing that it

13:54.770 --> 13:57.272
When we inquired of U.S.

13:57.372 --> 14:05.560
News why we hadn't emerged in our top 50 to discover we weren't even in the set of schools being considered to be in the top 50.

14:05.580 --> 14:08.022
Who else in Texas was considered at that point?

14:08.082 --> 14:13.807
Well, at that time, the only consistent school was the University of Texas at Austin.

14:14.528 --> 14:24.777
There were a few surveys that SMU might show up on and a few that Rice's name might appear, but the University of Texas was the only one consistently ranked.

14:24.757 --> 14:30.363
And we concluded that basically we had to do a better job of communicating where we were.

14:30.403 --> 14:41.296
And we really put a lot of effort into that to make sure that people understood what was going on with A&M.

14:41.957 --> 14:53.650
In fact, Bill Mobley had done a survey when he was dean, which he quite appropriately just filed away after he got the results of it, that discovered that even in the state of Texas that there weren't

14:54.305 --> 15:01.255
a large number or proportion of the population that didn't even know we offered an MBA program at A&M.

15:02.577 --> 15:13.753
And, you know, it was clear that we had a far better program and far better capabilities than what was perceived.

15:13.793 --> 15:17.038
And so we put a major effort into communications.

15:17.592 --> 15:19.719
And I think it's paid off very well.

15:19.779 --> 15:25.598
When you arrived, were there any fires that you had to put out immediately?

15:26.000 --> 15:27.906
Any problems that had to be solved?

15:28.949 --> 15:34.515
Well, there were some resource issues, but those are fairly typical.

15:36.637 --> 15:37.838
No, there weren't.

15:37.858 --> 15:56.357
And to put it in a context, for example, there are a lot of situations where you go in and at that time there were some areas in some business schools around the country, like business communications, that essentially were not on the cutting edge and that

15:56.641 --> 15:59.746
where you'd really have to eliminate departments and so forth.

16:00.207 --> 16:02.511
And really much of that had already been done.

16:02.551 --> 16:04.454
I was very fortunate in that regard.

16:04.514 --> 16:10.284
The college had had good leadership, Bill Mobley and Bill Muse and John Pearson before that.

16:10.364 --> 16:14.852
And, you know, so there weren't any of these

16:14.832 --> 16:21.780
lingering issues that occupy a lot of time and detract you from a focus.

16:21.820 --> 16:27.467
So we were able to get right down to business and that was very helpful for me and very helpful for the college.

16:28.107 --> 16:35.796
So I'm hearing you say there was nothing you had to go and undo and get back to running.

16:36.557 --> 16:39.861
It was just turn the engine up to a higher speed and

16:40.043 --> 16:56.363
And really lay out some specific kinds of targets to get the conversations and the college focused on those so that we could come to a consensus, this is where we want to head.

16:56.443 --> 17:00.247
And really that was not that difficult to do.

17:00.347 --> 17:02.490
I think people were ready.

17:02.470 --> 17:05.493
Let's get going.

17:05.513 --> 17:12.680
And in terms of organization of the college by departments and so forth, how did you find that?

17:13.881 --> 17:18.405
I think for the most part, it's fairly traditional and fairly functional.

17:18.866 --> 17:27.194
And we did a little tweaking on it, but very little.

17:28.435 --> 17:30.857
Very little was necessary.

17:30.837 --> 17:41.611
We, you know, for example, in accounting, we added a little bit of an in-house systems component in accounting because the discipline was moving that way.

17:42.292 --> 17:57.932
But for the most part, the departments were a very workable organization, and we had, for the most part, good leadership in the departments in terms of the department heads.

17:57.952 --> 18:00.355
Who were the best department heads when you arrived?

18:00.875 --> 18:10.026
Well, you know, I would just mention some that I thought were particularly good, and one's still department head at Jim Benjamin at accounting.

18:11.808 --> 18:24.823
Jim, we kid him that he obviously was underage when he took the job because he's been department head for like 18 years, and he's still a relatively young person.

18:25.293 --> 18:40.922
But he's one of those rare people that seems to maintain enthusiasm and a renewed focus and strategic sense and the county department has done a very good job.

18:41.307 --> 18:45.316
and maintaining a very positive approach.

18:45.837 --> 18:48.403
And he's done very well.

18:48.423 --> 18:52.111
Don Hellrigal was head of the management department after him.

18:52.172 --> 18:57.223
Mike hit, and they were both as outstanding scholars and outstanding people.

18:58.300 --> 19:01.225
So there was a lot of strong leadership.

19:02.627 --> 19:12.403
In the various specific areas compared to other institutions at that time, where did A&M rank in business in those majors?

19:12.423 --> 19:14.166
Where did we rank best?

19:14.669 --> 19:25.181
Yeah, I think probably our highest visibility externally was in management and marketing in terms of the academic.

19:25.682 --> 19:31.929
Our highest visibility in the professional community was accounting.

19:33.090 --> 19:36.334
I think there were pockets of other areas.

19:36.654 --> 19:38.837
We were strong in banking.

19:39.003 --> 19:46.736
but relatively weak in investments in corporate finance, and I think everybody agreed we needed to make an effort there.

19:47.478 --> 19:59.138
And I think everybody sensed that we had a good beginning but had a lot of work to do in the management information systems area, this because it was growing so much in importance.

19:59.118 --> 20:04.732
And frankly, we were starting at almost ground zero in the international business area.

20:05.334 --> 20:09.364
And it's really remarkable how much we progressed in that area.

20:09.384 --> 20:12.452
And I give credit to people like Carrie Cooper.

20:13.057 --> 20:40.380
who Kerry Cooper was a distinguished scholar in finance but has agreed to kind of take a mission to bring this college where it needed to be in international business and really single-handedly and I support him every way I could but I give him a lot of the credit for what we've done in that area because he was starting

20:40.867 --> 20:44.275
I was disappointed where we were in that area.

20:45.137 --> 20:52.395
In terms of the organization by departments and so forth, were there any changes that you wanted to make?

20:53.573 --> 20:57.340
No, you know, we had some questions we had to answer.

20:59.764 --> 21:02.469
Really, like I'll go to the international.

21:02.509 --> 21:07.718
Were we going to some business schools create a separate department international?

21:09.080 --> 21:18.737
We concluded that was not the best thing to do, that we were better off having scholars grounded in the basic disciplines, but with an orientation toward

21:18.717 --> 21:21.003
toward international.

21:21.404 --> 21:29.543
We really had to decide that we want to disperse our technology component across all departments or focus it more.

21:29.584 --> 21:31.849
We concluded we wanted to focus it more.

21:32.268 --> 21:54.040
But, you know, those are the sort of ongoing questions and really we were structured such with a small number of departments that were large enough and flexible enough to accommodate just about anything we wanted to do in that structure.

21:54.020 --> 22:05.005
As you are being recruited, were you assured that there would be receptivity to your new ideas?

22:06.830 --> 22:11.320
Yeah, I never

22:12.110 --> 22:24.165
once doubted that as long as we were reasonable in our expectations and thoughtful in our request, that we would get a fair hearing.

22:25.266 --> 22:37.881
And I must say that I, you know, there were times that obviously we disagreed with the decisions and times that we thought we needed more and could have used more.

22:38.317 --> 22:54.334
but i certainly never felt like that we we got anything less than a fair hearing and and what i would consider very positive support i just you know it's a lot of people

22:55.057 --> 23:08.695
can't make that that statement in a lot of university settings and of course it was also a time that was it was a very fortunate time in the history of the state and history of this university there was

23:09.097 --> 23:17.611
considerable increase in the puff monies at that time.

23:18.392 --> 23:24.301
You know, so it was a wonderful time to be coming, don't you know?

23:24.502 --> 23:36.741
In those early interviews, visits, and then your early experiences here, did anybody tease you about the fact that you had gone to other institutions and not this one?

23:36.788 --> 23:54.038
Yeah, I you know even Even some of the I can't remember the specific Regents, but you know some of the Regents kidded me about my University of Texas heritage and

23:54.288 --> 23:57.954
Coming from the University of Houston wasn't much of a problem.

23:57.974 --> 24:02.882
The three degrees from the University of Texas was where the real problem was.

24:02.962 --> 24:10.575
And, you know, fortunately, I think

24:11.382 --> 24:20.831
By that stage of the institutionals' development, those all fell in the category of this good humor rather than anybody having any serious concerns about it.

24:21.331 --> 24:22.873
And it really helped a lot then.

24:23.453 --> 24:29.599
When we moved here, my daughter was a junior in high school and my son was a freshman in high school.

24:30.620 --> 24:36.366
And they both decided, this fell in love with A&M, decided they would go to school here.

24:36.426 --> 24:39.769
And in fact, they both ended up getting master's degrees here.

24:39.749 --> 24:50.205
Now that I have four degrees from A&M in my family, a lot of my checkered background taint has been removed.

24:50.225 --> 24:54.231
One I love to tell on myself, one time I was doing the muster speech in Fort Worth.

24:55.513 --> 24:57.977
Old man interrupted my speech.

24:57.957 --> 24:59.919
He said, you didn't go to A&M.

24:59.959 --> 25:01.120
What kind of Aggie are you?

25:01.740 --> 25:03.722
I said, sir, I'm an Aggie by choice.

25:04.303 --> 25:06.304
He stood back up and said, what the hell does that mean?

25:06.825 --> 25:11.569
I said, well, when I first got employed at A&M, I didn't have much of a choice.

25:11.589 --> 25:12.510
This was the best job.

25:13.531 --> 25:20.096
But since then, I've had a few opportunities to go elsewhere, but I've decided that I want to stay at A&M, at least for the present.

25:20.877 --> 25:26.462
And then on a guess, I said, and I understood that some people didn't have a choice as to where they went to school.

25:26.813 --> 25:29.035
He jumped back up and he said, you're darn right.

25:29.556 --> 25:41.969
In the fall of 1927, my dad called me in the front room of our farmhouse up near Jacksboro, and he said, son, you can stay here this fall and pick cotton, or you can go to College Station, and maybe they'll straighten you out.

25:42.410 --> 25:45.433
I didn't have a choice.

25:45.453 --> 25:45.713
That's right.

25:45.733 --> 25:51.699
And I've used that one a few times, and I'll see a few people nod their heads.

25:51.719 --> 25:54.222
You know, it's my observation that

25:54.877 --> 25:58.845
farmer students and groups like that that

26:01.188 --> 26:17.768
But as long as you display that you're really committed to this institution, that they don't much care where you went to school at that point as long as they think that you really are committed to making A&M better.

26:18.249 --> 26:28.782
All right, share some of your first experiences with Aggie students, former students, politicians, and so forth.

26:30.061 --> 26:57.469
Well, I'll tell a story on myself, and this is one of the few kind of negative things that happened in those first few years, although I really find it humorous now to look back on it, but we had actually, the head of our finance department, Gary Trennepole, who was really a

26:58.816 --> 27:03.962
great asset for our college and has now gone on to be dean at another university.

27:03.982 --> 27:16.397
But Gary, before I got here, I had already arranged for T. Boone Pickens to make a presentation on campus.

27:16.497 --> 27:21.784
And T. Boone was in the news everywhere at that time on the cover of Business Journal.

27:21.804 --> 27:25.228
He was certainly an appropriate person to have here.

27:25.867 --> 27:36.273
And Gary had a program in the department that for a big-name speaker, we'd give them sort of an award.

27:36.594 --> 27:40.905
You know, it wasn't any major event, but...

27:41.577 --> 27:58.759
And so I got a, this was going to happen in November, and I got a call in about October from a reporter for the Houston Chronicle saying that, was I aware that a prominent

27:59.127 --> 28:22.097
former student in Houston was a was an arch enemy of T. Boone Pickens and that that he was very upset and that that we were having him there and speaking to the students and then they had insult the injury going to give him some kind of little war just a plaque and

28:22.617 --> 28:35.272
In fact, the reporter said, in fact, Mr. X said that that new business school dean up there must be a liberal son of a bitch.

28:35.673 --> 28:41.520
And I told the reporter, you know, she said, what do you think about that?

28:41.560 --> 28:47.307
I said, well, you know, first of all, anybody who's as prominent a former student as this has done much for the university.

28:47.387 --> 28:50.110
We're concerned when they're concerned.

28:50.090 --> 28:56.758
I'd be glad to talk to him about it but basically we feel like that one of our roles is to get people that are in the news here and

28:57.717 --> 29:04.866
And I said, you know, the only thing I'm troubled by is the liberal son of a bitch that I've never had anybody call me a liberal before.

29:06.709 --> 29:16.061
So apparently she relayed that back to him and he thought that was kind of funny and I've never had any other problems since then with him.

29:16.402 --> 29:19.746
So in fact, I have a fine relationship with him.

29:19.766 --> 29:24.232
All right, what about examples of the positive of interest and dedication?

29:24.713 --> 29:27.336
Yeah, well I think anybody,

29:28.109 --> 29:34.297
is struck even today by the quality of our undergraduate students.

29:34.397 --> 29:37.802
They're exceptional by most any standards.

29:38.463 --> 29:46.894
And fortunately that hasn't changed and maybe I've just gotten more used to it, but it was really striking I think when I came here.

29:46.874 --> 29:59.492
their involvement with the university, their commitment to do the best they can, the leadership opportunities.

30:00.273 --> 30:06.182
We hear a lot about the core at A&M, but I'm telling you, there aren't many business schools in the country where

30:06.162 --> 30:16.891
where the student leadership plans parents weekend, plans a career fair that the corporate world tells us the best that they go to, and it's really all the students.

30:16.971 --> 30:19.493
I mean, they work on it all year long.

30:19.513 --> 30:26.539
And, you know, you just don't see that, and certainly I had not experienced it in places that I had been.

30:27.440 --> 30:31.584
So you couldn't keep from being very positively struck by that.

30:32.384 --> 30:35.427
And then the A&M network,

30:35.879 --> 30:57.550
I mean that's a very real thing and I've seen it with my own kids that when they go to a new place new city to work and so forth within a month there's generally some kind of reception of former students in town they meet people and and and then you know the first time that you attend some of the

30:58.222 --> 31:16.247
the traditional ceremonies uh like muster and silver tabs is this i mean that's a will make an impact on anybody and you think this is a very exceptional kind of educational environment and and i've always been
