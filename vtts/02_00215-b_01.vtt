WEBVTT

00:02.900 --> 00:09.069
What did you do as you all got here socially?

00:09.349 --> 00:10.551
Who were some close friends?

00:10.631 --> 00:11.733
What did you all do to relax?

00:13.896 --> 00:19.143
Well, there wasn't a whole lot of time to relax in that job, but we had a lot of good friends.

00:20.445 --> 00:31.641
My wife, as the PMS wife, the three colonels' wives were on the board of the local officers' wives club.

00:32.195 --> 00:36.882
And so she got active, and since being on the board, they've since changed that group.

00:36.902 --> 00:39.827
Describe, nobody knows anything about that group.

00:39.847 --> 00:40.809
Describe that.

00:41.009 --> 00:50.745
Well, it's an officer's wives club, and it started with the Army ROTC people and, you know, the military people in the Trigon.

00:50.805 --> 00:55.452
It got started, and any local retired person could,

00:55.668 --> 01:01.116
the wife could become a member, but it had to be, you had to retire from active service.

01:01.136 --> 01:07.526
You couldn't be retired reserve or something like that, which has presented a problem from time to time.

01:07.586 --> 01:12.674
Women wanting to come in and join, and their wife was retired as a reserve officer.

01:12.734 --> 01:13.575
They're not eligible.

01:14.095 --> 01:27.815
But anyway, it was retired officers, and it was strong in the Trigon, but over the years in the military services, young wives have gotten away from joining Officers' Wives Club and so forth, and a lot of them work and so forth.

01:27.835 --> 01:37.109
So now it has evolved into almost exclusively retired officers' wives, and it's an active club.

01:37.169 --> 01:41.335
In the years you were coming, where did they meet?

01:42.108 --> 01:50.202
Well, they had luncheons at different places, and they had luncheons at people's houses, and meeting in people's homes or restaurants.

01:50.222 --> 01:51.705
Three dozen, four dozen, how many people?

01:52.246 --> 02:00.200
Oh, they would have, I imagine around 30 or more, something like that, 20 to 30, depending on, then they have coffees.

02:00.360 --> 02:01.642
It was an active club.

02:01.662 --> 02:03.205
It still is an active club.

02:03.927 --> 02:10.795
Now, during those years you were Commandant, you didn't have much time off during the nine months of the school year, did you?

02:10.815 --> 02:11.737
No, no, I sure didn't.

02:13.279 --> 02:13.739
Christmas.

02:15.682 --> 02:18.725
And so children came here, you didn't go?

02:18.785 --> 02:20.147
Right, yeah, they came here.

02:21.028 --> 02:24.913
And were you a hunter or a fisherman or anything like that?

02:24.933 --> 02:25.834
Well, I deer hunted everybody.

02:26.017 --> 02:26.357
Did you?

02:26.558 --> 02:28.059
I did manage to get a few days off.

02:28.079 --> 02:29.100
Where did you go deer hunting?

02:29.120 --> 02:38.150
Well, down near Lano in that area and now up near Gatesville, Lampass is up in that area.

02:38.310 --> 02:40.553
You never did stop at Cooper's to have barbecue, did you?

02:40.953 --> 02:41.674
Yes.

02:41.794 --> 02:44.016
Yeah, in Lano, sure.

02:44.076 --> 02:45.838
I think that's one of the best I know of.

02:45.959 --> 02:48.181
Yeah.

02:49.222 --> 02:52.325
Describe what it was like working with John Colas.

02:52.566 --> 02:53.046
Describe.

02:53.106 --> 02:53.847
Well, it was just

02:54.063 --> 02:54.864
Fantastic.

02:54.884 --> 02:57.367
He is such a super, super individual.

02:57.747 --> 03:01.331
I just, you know, I had great respect for him.

03:01.351 --> 03:05.435
Make believe I didn't know him and describe his manner and his style.

03:05.495 --> 03:07.037
Well, he's one of these guys.

03:07.117 --> 03:15.846
We went to a lot of A&M Mother's Clubs meeting, and he was one of the guys who walked in there, and every mother came over, and he kissed every one of them, you know.

03:16.607 --> 03:19.210
I used to tell him that he better be careful down there.

03:19.966 --> 03:26.356
because some guy is a member of the Houston A&M Club, you know, that used to be a male and now a female.

03:26.436 --> 03:29.160
I said, be careful who you kiss down there.

03:29.862 --> 03:39.777
But he was just an outgoing, you know, had an outgoing personality and remembered names like, I just could not believe how he could remember people's names.

03:39.797 --> 03:40.999
I've never known anybody as good as.

03:41.219 --> 03:45.366
In fact, he said if he ever met a person, a cadet, I mean a student,

03:45.633 --> 03:49.097
And if he didn't call them by name the next time, he'd buy them a steak dinner.

03:49.558 --> 03:51.380
I don't know.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.683
I'd be in the poorhouse if I did that.

03:54.283 --> 03:58.889
Now, when he served in the armed services, he was an enlisted man, wasn't he?

03:58.989 --> 04:01.151
No, he was an artillery lieutenant.

04:01.171 --> 04:02.052
Oh, was he?

04:02.453 --> 04:02.653
Oh, okay.

04:02.693 --> 04:05.557
So he had some understanding of that.

04:06.338 --> 04:09.301
What do you think his general principles were?

04:09.642 --> 04:10.623
What were his guiding?

04:12.024 --> 04:13.446
Well, he was, he was,

04:14.489 --> 04:19.857
treat every student and every other person with respect.

04:19.877 --> 04:20.698
That was one thing.

04:21.920 --> 04:25.345
And to be fair and honest with them.

04:26.366 --> 04:33.357
Did anybody ever doubt his affection for respect for the Corps?

04:34.078 --> 04:35.440
No, no, I don't think so.

04:36.061 --> 04:37.803
I never heard of any of them.

04:38.144 --> 04:42.370
Yeah, he had great respect for the Corps and for the Commandant's Office and so forth.

04:42.755 --> 04:52.544
He, I had one, one kind of, it wasn't an incident, but one situation.

04:53.345 --> 05:03.635
And that, I found out that the disciplinary people in the student services had kicked two cadets out of the university and suspended them.

05:03.715 --> 05:05.136
And I didn't even know there was a problem.

05:06.398 --> 05:07.859
Well, it wasn't that there was a problem.

05:07.919 --> 05:11.142
My problem with this is that

05:11.729 --> 05:14.812
They took disciplinary action without me ever knowing about it.

05:15.553 --> 05:21.719
So we went to the mat on this one, and we met with John Colas.

05:21.739 --> 05:32.750
General Simpson was there with me, and then Ron Blatchley and Powell, Charlie Powell, was on the opposing team, you might say.

05:34.452 --> 05:38.496
So we went in there, and I explained the situation the way I understood it.

05:39.758 --> 05:42.301
And they explained the situation the way they understood it.

05:43.542 --> 05:50.569
And so I said, what I want to do, if a cadet has any problems, I want to know about it.

05:52.011 --> 06:00.560
If it's a problem that could lead to suspension from the university, then I will turn it over to the student services.

06:01.261 --> 06:06.086
But if it's a lesser problem, I'll administer the discipline.

06:06.426 --> 06:08.989
And of course, I will inform everyone what I've done.

06:09.661 --> 06:24.734
So General Simpson, being the shrewd individual he is, he immediately wrote up a memorandum of understanding and put all this in writing and sent it to John Colas and sent it to Powell and to Blatchley.

06:25.816 --> 06:28.322
And, you know, we really went after it.

06:28.342 --> 06:29.745
We had some hard words in there.

06:30.029 --> 06:31.691
Not John.

06:31.832 --> 06:35.878
John was back observing, and so was General Simpson.

06:35.918 --> 06:37.961
But anyway, we really went after it for a while.

06:38.081 --> 06:45.592
But anyway, General Simpson sent this memorandum of understanding, and so from then on, it went the way we wanted it to go.

06:45.813 --> 06:55.207
And there were occasions where there was an offense, and I would submit it over there, and I would always submit it with a recommendation, such as drugs.

06:55.828 --> 06:59.513
There was a zero tolerance on drugs in the Corps.

06:59.932 --> 07:09.161
If anybody was caught with, and usually it was someone, they'd find a cigarette in their ashtray, you know, in their automobile.

07:09.181 --> 07:21.814
But if anyone was caught with drugs, with possession of drugs or smoking or whatever, using drugs, I would send them over and I would tell them, you're going to be suspended in the university.

07:22.735 --> 07:29.162
Now, if you want to come back next semester, if they let you come back next semester and you want to be in the Corps,

07:29.648 --> 07:31.932
then I want you to come in here and we'll talk about it.

07:32.293 --> 07:37.322
But you're gonna have to assure me at that time that you're clean and you're not gonna do it again.

07:37.602 --> 07:41.369
But you can come back, but I've gotta have some assurance.

07:41.389 --> 07:44.515
So I would get them suspended from the university.

07:44.715 --> 07:45.938
Did that occur?

07:45.998 --> 07:48.282
Yes, I suspended several.

07:48.602 --> 07:49.905
About how many?

07:50.165 --> 07:52.770
I wouldn't know how many, probably one or two a semester.

07:53.408 --> 07:57.915
So maybe... There may have been a drug problem, but I never was aware of it.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.919
So in the five years, a dozen?

08:00.139 --> 08:03.304
Well, I wouldn't have any way of knowing that.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.348
What kind of drugs normally was it?

08:05.368 --> 08:05.889
Marijuana.

08:05.969 --> 08:07.672
Marijuana, smoking marijuana.

08:07.692 --> 08:09.214
And then there was angel dust.

08:09.495 --> 08:12.700
I got word that there was some angel dust going around in the core.

08:13.507 --> 08:17.771
Was there any clue as to where they were getting this?

08:18.051 --> 08:26.338
No, I often wasn't, but there were plenty of kids around selling it, and they were having problems with the civilian students.

08:26.358 --> 08:30.742
I'm not sure they had zero tolerance over there, but I certainly did.

08:31.082 --> 08:39.149
Was there any similarity of the individuals who were using drugs?

08:39.510 --> 08:40.330
No.

08:40.350 --> 08:42.332
Were they freshmen or seniors?

08:42.633 --> 08:47.117
I can't remember that.

08:47.499 --> 08:50.736
Did any parent ever try to intervene?

08:51.323 --> 08:55.668
Well, I had a parent that wanted to get his son back in the Corps, and I talked straight to him.

08:55.788 --> 09:02.957
I said, you know, I'll let him back in, but he's got to assure me that he's not going to be using drugs in the Corps.

09:02.997 --> 09:03.598
I can't have it.

09:03.858 --> 09:04.599
Did he come back?

09:05.400 --> 09:05.680
Yes.

09:08.264 --> 09:09.926
Some did and some didn't.

09:10.506 --> 09:12.569
Nobody threatened a lawsuit?

09:12.589 --> 09:13.110
No.

09:14.191 --> 09:14.371
Okay.

09:15.212 --> 09:17.635
All right, as far as you were aware,

09:17.851 --> 09:29.318
was your action regarding drugs more severe than the policy regarding drugs by a civilian student?

09:29.338 --> 09:33.868
I don't know what, really, I don't know what their policy was, but my policy was

09:34.203 --> 09:36.086
Zero tolerance.

09:36.106 --> 09:38.068
And I surely agree with you totally.

09:39.090 --> 09:45.779
I don't think they were that strict over the civilian side.

09:45.799 --> 09:47.481
I suspect you are correct.

09:49.824 --> 09:54.771
Let's talk about women in the Corps, an important issue during that time.

09:55.352 --> 10:03.062
When you got here, about how many of the 2,400 or so in the Corps, about how many women were there?

10:03.464 --> 10:12.496
I would say there were probably about, probably a few more than 50, might have been 75.

10:12.556 --> 10:13.958
Were they in all three branches?

10:15.440 --> 10:30.079
Well, they were in all three branches, but we had an Air Force unit, and then we had the Army unit, and most of the Navy cadets were in the Army unit, because there weren't very many Navy cadets, but we had enough Air Force to make an Air Force unit.

10:30.127 --> 10:35.934
So you didn't have to make any decision regarding the beginning of women?

10:36.014 --> 10:37.095
No, no, I inherited it.

10:37.375 --> 10:44.023
Where did you first confront any realities regarding women in the Corps?

10:44.043 --> 10:52.793
Well, it was a constant problem because the cadets would, you know, refuse to shake their hand or they would,

10:53.144 --> 10:56.251
They would do something, and I would have to get involved in that.

10:56.431 --> 11:11.203
And, you know, one time they threw a dead possum or a dead armadillo into the dorm, and I think probably Zintcraft was involved in that one.

11:11.656 --> 11:20.512
And one time they brought in some pig manure from the pig farm and put in there, and that was a, you know, that's usually happened one or two times a year.

11:20.552 --> 11:29.147
Maybe not in the male, not in the female unit, but it may be in the male unit, but this time it happened in the female unit, and of course that has a terrible smell.

11:30.389 --> 11:32.072
There was, it was just a constant thing.

11:32.132 --> 11:36.600
I had one guy that mooned the girls out of the window and,

11:37.053 --> 11:39.404
You know, I took disciplinary action.

11:39.625 --> 11:42.418
Every time something came up, I took disciplinary action.

11:42.820 --> 11:45.493
And I wasn't light on them at all.

11:46.368 --> 11:55.524
Did the student, did the male members of the Corps accuse you of being too protective of the women?

11:55.544 --> 11:56.245
Oh, yeah, sure.

11:56.265 --> 11:56.646
Yeah, I think.

11:58.168 --> 12:07.144
But they wouldn't speak to, sometimes, some wouldn't speak, some wouldn't shake their hand, just all kind of little things like that.

12:07.124 --> 12:10.087
And it was constant, you know, it was just going on and on.

12:10.348 --> 12:15.473
What other important decisions regarding co-education in the Corps did you make?

12:15.493 --> 12:21.960
Well, the first major decision was boots, you know, letting the women wear boots.

12:22.561 --> 12:23.922
And what had they worn before that?

12:24.183 --> 12:27.006
Well, they had not worn boots.

12:27.466 --> 12:28.768
They wore skirts.

12:29.188 --> 12:29.729
And shoes.

12:29.989 --> 12:30.590
And shoes.

12:31.731 --> 12:35.595
So I formed a committee in the Corps.

12:36.993 --> 12:53.591
and had them study it on what we're gonna do next year on, I got juniors, they're gonna be seniors next year, what are we gonna do about, how are we gonna introduce boots, and it's not are we gonna do it, it's how are we gonna introduce boots into the Corps.

12:53.611 --> 13:06.645
And they came back with kind of a, I had Captain Bill Faulkner, who was one of my officers and one of my best officers,

13:07.233 --> 13:10.297
And he worked well.

13:10.397 --> 13:19.189
In fact, he was an advisor to one of the women's units, and he worked well with cadets, and he was kind of the advisor for the study group.

13:19.790 --> 13:21.652
So he kind of helped them write it and everything.

13:21.692 --> 13:27.420
And it came back, and it was kind of wishy-washy.

13:27.720 --> 13:32.667
It wasn't really a definite decision on how to do things,

13:33.254 --> 13:37.741
And there was a lot in there about don't let them wear boot pants and this and that.

13:37.801 --> 13:39.304
So anyway, we implemented that.

13:39.324 --> 13:45.293
And the next year we had them in boots, but they wore skirts with the boots.

13:45.374 --> 13:50.762
And then I think the year after that, we let them start wearing pants.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.632
But it was, you know, a lot of people resented that women were going to wear boots.

13:57.613 --> 13:58.755
Were there other...

13:59.123 --> 14:07.206
Were there other factors that the diehard male members of the Corps resented about the women?

14:08.068 --> 14:10.956
Well, they just resented

14:11.392 --> 14:13.315
generally that they were in the Corps.

14:13.455 --> 14:15.678
They didn't have any business in the Corps.

14:16.118 --> 14:20.144
Now, in terms of academics, I presume the women were doing as well as the men?

14:20.164 --> 14:20.545
Oh, yeah.

14:20.565 --> 14:21.366
They were doing as well.

14:21.426 --> 14:24.410
And as far as military, they were doing as well.

14:24.730 --> 14:27.454
And some of them were doing a lot better than most of the cadets.

14:27.514 --> 14:31.099
I mean, we had some women over there that were going to make fine officers.

14:31.119 --> 14:32.701
And that's what I used to tell the Corps.

14:32.761 --> 14:33.282
I said, look,

14:33.852 --> 14:38.939
It's a fact in the services that they have females, and they need female officers.

14:38.979 --> 14:43.665
And what better place to provide female officers than Texas A&M?

14:43.726 --> 14:45.047
So let's get with the program.

14:46.069 --> 14:52.417
Now, let's talk about Melanie Zentgraft as much as we can appropriately.

14:53.319 --> 14:56.623
Did she enroll as a freshman?

14:56.643 --> 14:58.205
Yes, she came as a freshman.

14:58.225 --> 15:00.889
Do you remember anything about her?

15:01.443 --> 15:25.155
first months or years well no she was a pretty low profile the first year or so I and then I think it all started with she was wanting to get on the color guard and wasn't selected or something and and then now she thought that she had not gotten fair treatment oh yeah yeah yeah she thought that all along do you have any idea whether she did or didn't

15:25.844 --> 15:30.269
I'm sure she was treated like all the other females, which was not very good.

15:30.870 --> 15:32.993
You know, there's no question about that.

15:33.093 --> 15:37.058
But who would have made the decision about color guard members?

15:37.078 --> 15:42.885
Well, the color guard and, you know, that was, those were cadet.

15:43.686 --> 15:44.246
Cadet decision.

15:44.266 --> 15:46.249
Position and decision.

15:46.289 --> 15:47.570
We didn't get involved in that.

15:49.533 --> 15:53.117
But basically, she was paranoid.

15:53.603 --> 15:55.207
She thought everybody was against her.

15:55.989 --> 16:02.524
And I tried to work with her and tried to counsel her, and she would throw it right back in my face.

16:02.945 --> 16:07.597
I told her, you know, I said, you're one of the most insubordinate persons I've ever talked to.

16:08.218 --> 16:11.967
If you were in the Army, I'd court-martial you.

16:12.183 --> 16:15.066
Do you remember where her home was then?

16:15.647 --> 16:17.048
I don't know where it was.

16:17.408 --> 16:19.450
I thought it was San Antonio, but I'm not sure.

16:19.551 --> 16:21.012
I think it wasn't her.

16:21.212 --> 16:28.600
Her mother was, I know her mother was in a wheelchair, and her father, they were divorced, and her father, I think, was in the Air Force.

16:28.620 --> 16:29.521
That's what I thought.

16:31.223 --> 16:34.786
Did she go to, as far as you recall, go to summer camp and things like that?

16:34.806 --> 16:37.469
Yeah, she went to Air Force summer camp.

16:37.749 --> 16:40.452
Now, then she wanted to be in the band.

16:41.022 --> 16:42.604
No, she didn't want to be in the band.

16:42.664 --> 16:44.427
She just wanted girls to be in the band.

16:44.447 --> 16:44.987
Oh, okay.

16:45.088 --> 16:45.328
All right.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.411
And she wanted girls to be in the Cav.

16:47.491 --> 16:49.854
And the thing about it is we had a girl in the Cav.

16:50.815 --> 16:54.100
She wanted girls to be in the Ross Volunteers.

16:54.120 --> 16:55.842
No one had ever applied.

16:55.902 --> 16:59.888
In order to get in the Ross Volunteers, the first thing you have to do is apply.

16:59.928 --> 17:02.011
No one had ever applied to be in the Ross Volunteers.

17:02.031 --> 17:02.912
Did she apply?

17:03.567 --> 17:04.669
She did not apply.

17:04.709 --> 17:08.155
Oh, I thought she had, okay.

17:08.335 --> 17:09.217
Not that I remember.

17:09.537 --> 17:17.391
And as far as the color guard, we started making sure that we had females on the color guard, you know, which was only fair.

17:18.372 --> 17:22.960
And the band, you know, there was great resentment.

17:23.176 --> 17:27.642
Well, the band, first of all, see, the women were living in separate units.

17:28.402 --> 17:33.569
And to put them in the band, they would have to live in a separate unit down here and then go back and forth between the band.

17:33.589 --> 17:34.450
Well, that doesn't work out.

17:34.490 --> 17:37.374
That kind of defeats the way the corps operates.

17:38.014 --> 17:40.377
To be a member of the band, you need to live with the band.

17:40.618 --> 17:44.042
Well, we didn't have any female accommodations in the band.

17:45.824 --> 17:50.209
So it was, it really wasn't convenient, you might say.

17:50.250 --> 17:52.272
Of course, that's no excuse.

17:52.572 --> 17:58.537
But very few people, there was no one in the band that wanted females.

17:58.878 --> 18:06.104
And as far as the former students go, there was no former student that I ever knew that wanted people to be in the band.

18:06.124 --> 18:11.569
And we always said there's the world's largest all-male military marching band.

18:12.390 --> 18:15.713
Well, that carried a lot of weight.

18:16.934 --> 18:21.938
But anyway, it's finally worked out.

18:22.610 --> 18:25.996
We really didn't have any girls to apply for the band.

18:26.056 --> 18:34.853
In fact, from what I understood, the female civilian students on the campus didn't want females in the band either.

18:35.674 --> 18:36.997
But that's, you know.

18:37.017 --> 18:42.407
And don't I remember her writing letters to the editor and things like that about various

18:43.400 --> 18:45.884
Feminine issues in the battalion.

18:46.284 --> 18:47.806
I think that may have happened.

18:47.846 --> 18:49.349
I can't, I really can't remember.

18:49.369 --> 18:50.651
I know that she.

18:51.692 --> 18:54.957
Well, she wrote letters to a lot of, you know, like the president.

18:55.037 --> 18:55.818
That's what I was going to say.

18:55.838 --> 18:58.883
She wrote letters to Jarvis and to members of the legislature.

18:59.584 --> 18:59.684
Yeah.

18:59.704 --> 19:00.044
Oh, yeah.

19:00.064 --> 19:05.212
She stirred up a lot and wound up in a lawsuit.

19:05.232 --> 19:06.093
Yes, yes.

19:06.253 --> 19:08.817
And it was years before that lawsuit was settled.

19:09.158 --> 19:11.381
And I don't, what was the final?

19:11.401 --> 19:12.883
Well, they paid her off.

19:13.268 --> 19:17.674
something I'm not sure how much it was, and they paid off the ACLU.

19:17.734 --> 19:20.358
See, that was who was behind this, the ACLU.

19:20.438 --> 19:23.702
Was her allegation that she had been discriminated against, was that it?

19:23.763 --> 19:27.287
Her allegation was there was discrimination against females in the Corps.

19:27.788 --> 19:29.811
Oh, okay.

19:29.831 --> 19:30.252
All right.

19:30.272 --> 19:32.495
This is now a note for the typist.

19:35.859 --> 19:38.483
When Melanie Zintgraf graduated,

19:41.855 --> 19:46.963
This is the Saturday commencement in May of 1980.

19:47.003 --> 19:54.394
I was the dean of faculties about to leave to go to the University of Texas at El Paso as president.

19:55.635 --> 19:59.421
Lieutenant Governor William P. Hobby Jr.

19:59.621 --> 20:01.304
was our commencement speaker.

20:01.965 --> 20:05.550
Bill Hobby as he was known by everyone.

20:06.560 --> 20:19.499
Normally I sat on the back row at commencement as dean of faculties and would read the paperback book I had brought into the commencement inside my program.

20:19.599 --> 20:27.411
He asked me to come up and sit beside him as the diplomas were being passed out and so we chatted and he told me to stay in contact with him.

20:27.431 --> 20:29.715
He tried to help me and I was very much flattered.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.719
As I was getting ready to go back to my seat,

20:32.969 --> 20:47.448
because we were about to finish the commencement, I heard some hissing and quickly realized that the hissing coming from members of the student body was because Melanie Zentgraf was about to get her diploma.

20:48.629 --> 20:53.976
A&M students graduate in alphabetical order by college, by major, and by name.

20:55.378 --> 21:02.267
Melanie Zentgraf, Z-E-N-T-G-R-A-F, I believe it is, one F, happened to be

21:03.800 --> 21:09.765
an undergraduate majoring in biomedical science in the College of Veterinary Medicine.

21:10.666 --> 21:12.668
So Veterinary Medicine is the last college.

21:12.768 --> 21:17.712
It has one undergraduate major, and she was the last alphabetically.

21:18.733 --> 21:26.440
So I learned later that her family thought we had deliberately rigged it so that she would be the last of the last of the last.

21:27.441 --> 21:29.042
There was no plan of that at all.

21:30.303 --> 21:33.486
When she came across the stage, President Jarvis Miller,

21:34.023 --> 21:36.005
handed her her diploma.

21:36.605 --> 21:50.037
She took it in her right hand, shifted it to her left, put out her hand to him to shake it, and she, as I recall, and he very softly said, no way, I'm going to shake your hand.

21:51.058 --> 21:57.244
Those people who saw that kind of took a deep breath, and their eyes brightened up.

21:58.425 --> 22:01.988
She then turned to Bob Lacey, the registrar,

22:02.339 --> 22:05.883
put her hand out to him, and he said, ma'am, I'm not involved in this fight.

22:06.804 --> 22:18.917
Don Carter, the director of admissions, who was handing the diplomas to Lacey, who then handed them to President Miller, he then said, ma'am, let's keep the line moving.

22:19.558 --> 22:25.945
She went on off the stage, and we then stood and sang the Spirit of Aggieland.

22:26.105 --> 22:30.270
When we went into the Letterman's Lounge after commencement was over,

22:30.622 --> 22:32.404
to take off our caps and gowns.

22:32.585 --> 22:38.792
I remember hearing a number of regents and others saying it serves her right.

22:39.313 --> 22:40.595
She's been a pain in the neck.

22:41.536 --> 22:43.098
I wouldn't shake hands with her either.

22:44.099 --> 22:58.097
About six weeks later, the board threw at Dr. Miller immediately after telling him that he would no longer be the president.

22:58.330 --> 23:04.883
that apparently one of the first things they said to him was, quote, you refuse to shake hands with an A&M graduate.

23:05.664 --> 23:14.241
Melanie went on to active duty in the Air Force, and we don't know whether she's still on active duty or not, do we?

23:14.261 --> 23:20.794
No, she was on active duty several years, but she had problems in the Air Force just like she had here.

23:21.027 --> 23:38.884
uh you know the same allegations that they were she was being discriminated against or women being discriminated against then she got out of the air force and went to work for fedex and uh i've heard had sources tell me that the pilots in fedex didn't want to fly with her because she was

23:39.455 --> 23:44.822
accusing people of different things and threatening to sue people and so forth.

23:44.862 --> 23:46.684
So I don't know if she's still with FedEx.

23:46.724 --> 23:47.445
Was she a pilot?

23:47.886 --> 23:49.448
Yes, she was a pilot, yeah.

23:49.468 --> 23:56.337
Did she or anyone speaking in her behalf ever try to confront you?

23:57.238 --> 23:58.419
She did.

23:58.540 --> 24:02.705
Did anyone, her family or a lawyer?

24:02.725 --> 24:03.826
No, no.

24:04.928 --> 24:09.073
Well, the lawyers, see, I was supposed to be defended

24:09.273 --> 24:38.014
by the army because there were five of us sued and so the army was notified that i was being sued in my capacity here at a and m and so they sent down an army major and he we talked about and he went back and the next thing i know i was informed that the department of justice would defend me so they sent down two two liberal lawyers from from washington

24:38.669 --> 24:46.764
And I met with them for a day, and they were here a couple of days, I guess, and spent a lot of time with them.

24:46.784 --> 24:56.543
But when they went back, the next thing I heard that I was going to be dismissed from the lawsuit because the Department of Justice wanted to enter the suit on Zipgraf's side.

24:57.603 --> 25:00.066
So I was dismissed from the lawsuit.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.750
It was either with or without prejudice.

25:02.810 --> 25:11.962
I can't remember which it was, but I was dismissed in such a fashion that if I said anything or did anything, I could immediately be brought back in the lawsuit.

25:11.982 --> 25:13.384
So I wasn't free and clear.

25:13.484 --> 25:16.528
I was just out of that lawsuit at that particular time.

25:18.611 --> 25:22.716
Finally, when he went to court down in Houston, that was one of the things I brought up.

25:23.506 --> 25:48.973
to the judge that, you know, I was, I always thought there was a client, a client attorney privilege involved and then I told him about the, you know, about the fellow from the Justice Department that talked to me and then turned right around and passed the information I had on to the Justice Department and they made a decision to enter the case on Sintcraft's side.

25:49.595 --> 25:51.116
opposing Texas A&M.

25:51.136 --> 25:53.358
Well, they shut me up real quick.

25:53.379 --> 25:57.442
They didn't, no one wanted to talk about that or discuss that in the federal court.

25:58.323 --> 26:01.446
So they cut me off of that approach.

26:02.387 --> 26:06.951
Were there, in your five years, were there any other lawsuits?

26:07.632 --> 26:09.513
That was the only lawsuit.

26:09.694 --> 26:15.379
Any other threats of anything like that that the Commandant had been under?

26:15.399 --> 26:17.661
I don't think there was a threat of a lawsuit.

26:19.177 --> 26:20.178
All right, now let's go.

26:20.218 --> 26:22.581
What were some of the most joyful moments?

26:24.623 --> 26:25.124
Proudest?

26:26.125 --> 26:29.008
Well, you know, the core reviews, that was great.

26:29.048 --> 26:34.814
And any time we, like one time I went to, got a trip to Washington, D.C.

26:34.934 --> 26:44.785
to where one of the former cadets received the outstanding ROTC cadet for the United States, a big trophy.

26:44.805 --> 26:48.289
In fact, A&M won that trophy twice.

26:48.927 --> 26:51.953
I wonder where those two cadets aren't they?

26:51.973 --> 26:55.521
Well, the one that won it is dead.

26:55.661 --> 26:56.964
He died a few years ago.

26:57.645 --> 27:05.181
And I can't remember the other fella who, but we had the trophy down here for a year, got to keep it here.

27:06.244 --> 27:08.809
And you know, moments like that are proud.

27:09.160 --> 27:13.770
And when you give awards to people, that's a great moment.

27:13.810 --> 27:21.145
Parents' weekend, that's always a great time when all the parents come

27:21.614 --> 27:23.616
They have the activities in the core area.

27:24.818 --> 27:26.159
What about final review?

27:26.379 --> 27:42.577
Well, of course, final review, that was a problem, too, because they would come out in all kind of garb on the second time around, and I tried to show them pictures of how final review used to be, and, you know, it was a dignified, honorable service, I mean, event.

27:42.717 --> 27:47.723
And so I finally got them where they looked a little better.

27:47.703 --> 27:58.018
you know, now they wear, I guess it's all right, they wear their outfit t-shirts, but before they were coming out in cut-offs and sharts and things like that, and it was really bad.

27:58.038 --> 28:08.773
In fact, what we normally would do, we would let the general officer see the first go around, and then we would take him, we would get rid of him, get him out of the area.

28:09.313 --> 28:11.156
We didn't want him to see the second go around.

28:12.017 --> 28:16.123
So, you know, that was an ongoing problem, and

28:16.289 --> 28:20.882
And the final review always was on the drill field.

28:20.942 --> 28:21.905
On the drill field, yeah.

28:22.366 --> 28:26.738
What is now the Simpson drill field.

28:27.950 --> 28:32.456
Let's see, normally did you go, you went to commencements?

28:32.476 --> 28:33.717
Yes, yes.

28:33.777 --> 28:35.499
Well, I didn't go to commencement.

28:35.519 --> 28:39.104
I would go to the, unless they were going to commission at the commencement.

28:39.304 --> 28:40.045
Oh, okay.

28:40.065 --> 28:46.793
Now, during the fall, I mean, during the spring commencement, we had a regular commissioning exercise.

28:47.574 --> 28:57.687
During the winter, we usually had a commissioning along with the graduation, and during the summer, same thing, commissioning with graduation.

28:58.223 --> 29:06.462
Let's see, did the curriculum in ROTC instruction change in your years?

29:06.762 --> 29:15.233
Well, when I was in the Corps, the curriculum was branch ROTC, like I took infantry ROTC.

29:16.134 --> 29:22.262
And as it turned out, they didn't send me to branch school the way they do now.

29:22.322 --> 29:27.008
They'll send people to branch school to get qualified because I had the infantry training.

29:27.028 --> 29:32.955
Well, I went straight into the Army, and I was in the Army almost five years before I went to school.

29:33.728 --> 29:36.151
So it changed.

29:36.191 --> 29:38.034
That was a big change for the Army program.

29:38.114 --> 29:45.324
Now, of course, the Air Force program, and I really didn't know much about that, or the Navy Marine program, I didn't know much about that.

29:46.506 --> 29:50.271
The Army would have general, it was general military science.

29:50.312 --> 29:58.984
Now, you've got some tactics and things like that, but basically it was general military science, and go to summer camp at the end of your junior year.

29:59.845 --> 30:03.330
With the Air Force, they went to summer camp at the end of their sophomore year,

30:04.120 --> 30:11.449
And I'm not sure how they, what all they did, because I never really paid attention to the Air Force program for the other services.

30:11.970 --> 30:15.534
And all of those matters were decided by the service.

30:15.554 --> 30:15.815
Yes.

30:15.935 --> 30:19.219
Y'all didn't pick the curriculum, did you?

30:19.239 --> 30:20.501
No, no.

30:20.521 --> 30:31.134
The way I used to put it, when those cadets crossed that road out there and to the Corps area, then those are my people, the Corps of Cadets.

30:31.194 --> 30:32.035
I'm responsible.

30:32.386 --> 30:41.836
When they cross the street this way and come in and go to ROTC classes, then they're Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force responsibility.

30:41.856 --> 30:46.642
And whatever you want to do there is fine, but once they cross that street, they're mine.

30:47.222 --> 30:53.429
And their classes of ROTC instruction were generally in the Trigon?

30:53.449 --> 30:54.450
In the Trigon, yes.

30:54.710 --> 30:57.674
In fact, they were all in the Trigon.

30:59.496 --> 31:00.857
Academically,

31:01.478 --> 31:10.157
Could anybody have seen much difference in the three branches in those days in performance, grade point ratio, and so forth?

31:11.039 --> 31:12.322
I'm not aware of that.

31:13.465 --> 31:16.652
With what other institutions in the United States

31:17.037 --> 31:21.281
did you try to make comparisons?

31:21.861 --> 31:26.125
Well, there was an organization of military colleges.

31:26.966 --> 31:31.930
And we, once a year, we would meet at one of those military colleges for a conference.

31:32.891 --> 31:46.943
And so I made a trip to Norwich, to VMI, the Citadel, Virginia Tech, North Georgia, and then Texas A&M.

31:47.311 --> 31:48.913
considered military colleges.

31:48.973 --> 31:56.781
However, Virginia Tech and North Georgia was a little different, and A&M, of course.

31:57.822 --> 32:03.368
But Virginia Tech and A&M were the only two that were real university-like.
