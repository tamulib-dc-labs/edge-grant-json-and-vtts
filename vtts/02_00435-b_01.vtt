WEBVTT

00:05.954 --> 00:06.815
how do I do this? He says, you just call a Colonel, I

00:06.935 --> 00:29.543
believe that fellow's name was, yeah, Colonel 
Green in the Pentagon and gave me the phone number

00:06.935 --> 00:29.543
and just tell him what your name is, what your 
present duty is, where you're stationed, and that

00:06.935 --> 00:29.543
you want to join the American Volunteer Group 
under General Claire Chanel. Well, under Chanel.

00:37.645 --> 00:56.052
So,

00:37.645 --> 00:56.052
next morning I called, well, in the night I started 
talking to a couple of friends of mine who had gone

00:37.645 --> 00:56.052
over to California from Florida, same base, you 
know, two of my flying buddies, Jim Cross and

00:37.645 --> 00:56.052
George Burgard. They were much younger in the Air 
Force than I did. As a matter of fact, didn't

00:59.837 --> 01:03.122
practically have a flying school. And they liked 
the idea. Dave wanted to go, and I said, well, when I

01:05.624 --> 01:09.068
call, I'll mention his name. He said, okay. And I 
was told, boy, it happens like that when you call.

01:14.394 --> 01:23.845
So I called this Colonel Green, talked to his 
secretary, gave him a name, serial number, and all

01:14.394 --> 01:23.845
that type of stuff. And that evening, I gave him the 
name of this Jim, George, Burgoyne Jim Cross. That

01:35.088 --> 01:37.811
evening, there was a wire received from 
headquarters. An old colonel, he was a major then,

01:37.831 --> 01:43.178
Dias, D-I-A-Z, I'll never forget it. He called me 
in, and he said, Bob, what in the hell is this wire

01:43.198 --> 01:47.383
I've got? He says, I'm giving instruction to 
release you from active duty and reserve duty

01:48.103 --> 02:01.760
immediately, and here's your order sending you to 
your home for subsequent release to go on another

01:48.103 --> 02:01.760
mission. He said, what the hell is this all about? 
So I told him. Boy, he was madder than hell. He said,

02:06.516 --> 02:07.958
well, why don't you talk about it? I said, well, I 
didn't have a chance. It was one of those things

02:09.140 --> 02:11.624
that came up. He was mad to lose you. Oh, yeah. One of 
his key men. Same way as them. They had orders, too.

02:17.734 --> 02:18.776
Yeah, they got orders, too. Matter of fact, the 
same wire had all three names. But I was a flight

02:21.140 --> 02:23.824
leader, so that's what he called me. But he 
eventually understood and didn't hold anything.

02:28.932 --> 02:31.977
It took about, well, I was gone in about 48 hours. So 
you were out in L.A. at this time. And they paid my

02:36.711 --> 02:38.735
way home with dollars. They did. And I was given 
instructions, subsequent instructions on

02:39.596 --> 02:45.185
telephone from Colonel Green's office. I guess 
Colonel Green was a contact point. I had the

02:47.148 --> 02:50.333
project in the munitions building. Sure. And I was 
just told to go home and stay there until they

02:51.335 --> 02:58.086
contacted me. They figured I'd be around.

03:02.720 --> 03:13.718
And so I went home, and got a telephone call to 
report to San Francisco on September the 21st,

03:02.720 --> 03:13.718
1941. And that was about two weeks off. And they 
sent me an airline ticket, and I packed up my stuff

03:18.947 --> 03:27.261
and went to San Francisco. And I forget what hotel.

03:32.673 --> 03:34.515
buddies to be and a lot of other guys. As a matter of 
fact, there was about thirty-five of us on this

03:34.535 --> 03:37.438
contingent. There had already been two 
contingents shipped over. And we were to go over on

03:40.601 --> 03:53.574
the Bosch Fontaine, a Dutch motor ship, to 
Rangoon, Burma by various different means. It was

03:53.594 --> 03:54.254
a freighter? No, it was a—well, it was a—they call 
it a motorboat because it was propelled

04:02.643 --> 04:05.887
steamship, really. Well, it wasn't steam, it was 
oil propelled. Diesel. Diesel, yeah. But they

04:09.451 --> 04:13.256
call it the USS Boche Fontaine. It's the bottom of 
the ocean now, by the way. Some of the Japanese

04:14.898 --> 04:16.179
subsequently. It was quite a motor ship. It was 
diesel powered. And it was strictly passenger,

04:20.785 --> 04:23.928
some freight. They carried freight. Well, I say 
it's a combination. And about 35 of us guys Two

04:29.963 --> 04:39.517
contingents, as I said, had already gone over, and 
we were to go to Tongu, Burma, right in the central

04:29.963 --> 04:39.517
part of Burma, by way of Rangoon. And it was going to 
take us, but it so turned out we sailed on the 25th of

04:39.537 --> 04:50.593
September of 1941, and we docked at Rangoon 
October the 12th. Wow, that's a long time. That

04:52.495 --> 04:53.116
long. We went to Hawaii, and then from Hawaii we 
sailed due south for a long, long time. And I said,

04:59.680 --> 05:07.791
well, I found out even aboard ship that we were 
boarding the Japanese shipping lane for obvious

04:59.680 --> 05:07.791
reasons. This was a Dutch, you know. Sure. This 
goes back to, I think, I initially made the comment

05:10.275 --> 05:13.239
to you. I think it was Christmas Island we sailed 
right by. We saw it one day. But boy, it seemed like

05:18.326 --> 05:25.596
we were on that boat forever from Honolulu to 
Surabaya, Java. That was the first stop. Well, we

05:27.258 --> 05:28.540
picked up a pilot. off of Sydney, right here. No, 
Townsville. Picked up a poly right off

05:35.721 --> 05:41.808
Townsville, Australia, and we came on back down 
and sailed and came into Surabaya, Java. And it was

05:42.749 --> 05:53.802
there, Surabaya is quite a Dutch port, and we could 
see fortifications being put in then.

05:59.367 --> 06:02.191
against the Japanese.

06:04.816 --> 06:06.458
My passport, I was a clerk. Is that what it said on 
it? I had to sever. As a matter of fact, I even had to

06:09.984 --> 06:12.768
resign my reserve commission. Oh, okay. I wanted 
to know about that. What happened as far as the U.S.

06:14.390 --> 06:17.796
military is concerned? Because you were really 
getting out of the service. As a matter of fact, I

06:20.520 --> 06:26.910
was told through this Colonel Green's office that 
when you come back,

06:36.695 --> 06:38.757
But would you lose time? No. How did that work? 
Would you lose time and grade? I had to get out. I had

06:45.363 --> 06:47.565
to resign from the service. And he gave me an 
honorable discharge. And I also had to resign my

06:50.928 --> 06:57.454
reserve commission, which was sort of an unusual 
thing. I had to reserve all relations with the U.S.

06:57.654 --> 07:02.198
military. And upon return, I would be reinstated 
with my reserve commission, and it was debatable

07:04.741 --> 07:16.999
for longevity purpose of entity pay whether that 
one year would be held out or not. But

07:17.820 --> 07:28.777
subsequently, I was found out that they did not 
give me credit for that one year of service on my,

07:17.820 --> 07:28.777
figured my longevity pay. But my commission was 
dated back The day I got out of the service was

07:32.888 --> 07:46.485
actually, it was dated back to

07:32.888 --> 07:46.485
September the 20th, sometime in September. When I 
re-entered the service on October the 9th, I

07:47.387 --> 07:55.918
think, 1942, no, 43,

07:47.387 --> 07:55.918
when I got back home. 41, no wait, 42.

08:03.230 --> 08:17.164
My reserve commission was dated back to make it 
continuous, but my active duty service was picked

08:03.230 --> 08:17.164
up the day I returned to the military, so it got me 
here. And I went back, by the way, as second

08:17.184 --> 08:20.107
lieutenant. One week later, I was promoted to 
captain. Another week, I was promoted to major.

08:24.291 --> 08:26.113
The following week, I was promoted to lieutenant 
colonel. It was that understanding when I went

08:27.575 --> 08:30.958
back to the service. Well, what do you mean that? 
Well, I'm getting way ahead of myself. This is when

08:34.541 --> 08:36.724
I got out of the Flying Tiger and came back home. 
They tried to induct us over there, you know. No. To

08:41.911 --> 08:43.133
stay right on the job. But the way they were doing 
it. Well, we'll get to that. Let's get to that. But

08:48.340 --> 08:50.463
now let's go. I just wanted to find out the legality 
of how the service would allow one of their own

08:50.503 --> 08:57.232
pilots to become a volunteer. And then what would 
happen? to have a military career. Well, I dare say

09:02.303 --> 09:10.210
all of this was foreseen by the administration 
from the president on down. Look, we know we're

09:10.250 --> 09:12.953
going to be in a war with the Japanese. I've heard 
subsequently through political channels,

09:12.973 --> 09:27.827
diplomatic channels, subsequently in Russia, 
you know, amongst discussion with ambassadors

09:12.973 --> 09:27.827
and all, for instance Harriman, that Roosevelt 
supposedly made the comment that One of the

09:28.600 --> 09:35.371
greatest solutions to one of the most difficult 
problems he ever had was when the Japanese bombed

09:28.600 --> 09:35.371
Pearl Harbor. It made it simple for him. He just 
declared war on them. And he knew all along,

09:38.777 --> 09:43.505
eventually, he was going to be confirmed with the 
task of declaring war against Japan. But this made

09:44.266 --> 09:46.149
it simple. I don't know how true that is. And I would 
be a bit surprised if he made that step. Anyway.

09:53.441 --> 09:54.102
So you got? You were in the Far East. They knew 
they'd eventually take us over as part of the Air

09:55.520 --> 10:02.950
Forces of, let's say, the Far East. They knew 
they'd take us back. And was the understanding

10:03.670 --> 10:11.620
that you could sign up for as many one-year tours of 
duties with Chenault and Spalding Tigers as you

10:03.670 --> 10:11.620
wanted? Yeah, but the initial thing was for one 
year. The contract was for one year, and then if we

10:15.105 --> 10:19.590
continued on, you could sign up for another year. 
Your pay was a lot better. Oh, I was getting about,

10:21.372 --> 10:23.515
if I remember correctly, I was doing, as a second 
lieutenant in the Air Force, I think I was doing

10:24.052 --> 10:27.235
$100,000. You were a first lieutenant now. That's 
why I was doing $162 a month. $162 as a first

10:31.059 --> 10:32.841
lieutenant? Versus $600 a month. Plus $500 for the 
airplane. Plus all the expenses. I didn't have to

10:39.067 --> 10:43.111
pay any money for any food or lodging. And, of 
course, I was being trained in combat real estate.

10:48.937 --> 10:51.139
What was it like, and where were you sent? What base 
did you finally end up at? The base, the initial

10:56.297 --> 11:13.903
training base, in the middle of, well, actually 
the first continued arrived in June of 1942 at

10:56.297 --> 11:13.903
Tongu, Burma, T-O-U-N-G-O-O, right in the middle 
of the center of Burma at an RAF.

11:21.072 --> 11:26.399
They had the major control and influence in Burma. 
As a matter of fact, they had- They were the British

11:26.419 --> 11:29.363
Empire. Right, that's right. And they had three or 
four air bases on them, one of which was Tangu. Just

11:34.851 --> 11:42.862
a little tarmac strip, tarmac, British, is a 
mechanized strip about 2,000 feet long with a one

11:34.851 --> 11:42.862
hanger. That was their training base. Somehow or 
other, through Lend-Lease, and I don't know the

11:47.245 --> 12:02.783
story of this, but the Chinese with the British 
agreed to let Chenault use this base in Burma to

11:47.245 --> 12:02.783
train the American Volunteer Group. That's what 
it was called, American Volunteer Group. We

12:05.085 --> 12:08.870
didn't even know what Flying Tiger was at that 
time. And I think he was given a year to train the

12:09.651 --> 12:16.138
group and then move it up to China. after we were 
trained. He wanted freedom to train. See, bases in

12:18.880 --> 12:21.903
China were being bombed at that time. So he wanted 
freedom to train us. But one of the stipulations

12:24.226 --> 12:32.315
was, and the freedom he was given, he chose the most 
experienced and capable pilots he could get. He'd

12:32.935 --> 12:34.717
ask for the best. He got the cream of crop of 
maintenance people, armorers, communications

12:35.178 --> 12:46.210
people, all the logistical support types, 
airmen, Many of the guys were master sergeants of

12:47.067 --> 12:50.232
that type. Their pay was ordinarily increased. 
And nine-tenths of the guys were fighter pilots.

12:57.942 --> 13:02.108
The Navy, the Army, the Army Air Corps, and the 
Marine Corps. I think there were four Marine

13:02.128 --> 13:04.812
Corps. All of them were. Well, some of the guys in 
the Navy were bomber or attack pilots. And I was

13:10.160 --> 13:12.383
accepted.

13:19.383 --> 13:25.069
When Ault had it planned at that time, he had 
dreamed of really studying the entire Air Force

13:19.383 --> 13:25.069
and getting some bombers. Ultimately, when he had 
the 14th Air Force inducted into the service of the

13:25.389 --> 13:34.860
general, the United States Air Force, then he did 
get some bombers over there. And they visualized

13:34.880 --> 13:38.984
me being head of the bombing section when they got 
some B-17s. And, boy, I dreamed of that. But in the

13:40.926 --> 13:44.590
meantime, I was getting back fighters, P-40s. I'd 
never flown a P-40 in my life. OK. How about the

13:46.272 --> 13:47.533
training? So we arrived at Tongu by train from 
Rangoon, and some of the boys had been there

13:47.733 --> 14:00.531
already, met us, took us out, put us up in the 
barracks, and we started our training. How many

14:01.532 --> 14:02.353
were you? The initial plan, ultimate plan, was for 
100 pilots with 100 airplanes with a small staff

14:03.354 --> 14:16.913
for the group under Chenault himself, probably 
15, 20 staff people. and about 250 officers and

14:17.517 --> 14:25.745
officer types and airman types. Total of about 275 
in the entire group. That's 275 Americans. This is

14:31.490 --> 14:40.819
tantamount, this would be tantamount to a wing, a 
fighter wing in the United States Air Force, which

14:31.490 --> 14:40.819
on an ordinary base is around 4,100 people. But, 
now you see, we would just be the tactical outfit

14:40.839 --> 14:46.444
that would fly up to China and be imposed complete 
logistical organization of the Chinese Air

14:46.897 --> 14:58.109
Force, where they provided the messing, the fifth 
echelon maintenance and supply, and all of that

14:46.897 --> 14:58.109
stuff. So was Chenault there when you arrived? 
Chenault was already in China. Was he training you

15:05.337 --> 15:08.101
down there? Oh, yeah. His main office was in China, 
Kunming, China. We arrived, and well, since June,

15:14.150 --> 15:26.942
when the first contingent arrived, Tom Goo, he'd 
been spending most of his time at Tom Goo, you know,

15:14.150 --> 15:26.942
personally, with a few of his staff supervising 
the training. And as he received us, you know, he

15:27.822 --> 15:43.937
gleaned over our records and so forth, and picked 
the better qualified people for the certain key

15:27.822 --> 15:43.937
staff, and then as he learned more about certain 
people, you know, maybe this guy was more of a

15:27.822 --> 15:43.937
communicator than he was a pilot, he may have 
pulled him, put him in the communication. key

15:44.558 --> 15:46.881
staff members, like a material man. One guy living 
out here in Abilene, Texas right now, Pepe Paxton,

15:48.182 --> 16:01.819
he turned out to be, well, he had an accounting 
degree and he was quite a financial type of guy, and

15:48.182 --> 16:01.819
he wasn't a pilot at all, to tell you the truth about 
it. And he was a little bit older than the rest of us,

16:01.879 --> 16:06.825
so he made him his finance officer, that type of 
stuff. So we had a going organization. How good was

16:09.228 --> 16:10.209
the training? The training was, the training per 
se, I'd say was medium to good. It wasn't the best in

16:21.324 --> 16:33.098
the world because I'd say 98% of the pilots that 
came over had never flown a P-40 before. There'd

16:33.259 --> 16:37.344
only been one or two, I think, guys that had flown a 
P-40 before out of the airport. Langley Field had

16:37.364 --> 16:40.447
just gotten some P-40s, I think. And the rest of us 
were from other types of airplanes. The few who

16:45.882 --> 16:48.586
would talk, then they taught others, and they 
taught others. So the training really wasn't a big

16:48.646 --> 16:53.352
problem. We were elite. We were already trained 
people. For instance, I was a bomber pilot. You

16:59.159 --> 17:01.482
were getting used to the P-40. That's right. Being 
indoctrinated into, in other words, I was being

17:02.203 --> 17:07.610
re-equipped with a new airplane. I had one in mind, 
too. So you go on just training flights? Training

17:12.917 --> 17:15.180
flights, get indoctrinated, and... I had to rush 
through things. Sure. How long did you train?

17:22.756 --> 17:30.068
Well, if I remember correctly, I think I had my 
first flight about the first of November. I had

17:30.088 --> 17:35.577
about twelve hours in the P-40 on December 7th, 
when Warbrook moved. But I had already been on

17:35.597 --> 17:43.429
several, oh, many combat missions where doing 
actual, you know, engaging in aerial combat

17:47.780 --> 17:55.408
Matter of fact, I was, for the latter part of 
November, I was teaching some newcomers fighter

17:47.780 --> 17:55.408
tactics and P-40s. I'd been on gunnery missions. 
I'd never flown a gunnery mission, air-to-air

17:57.330 --> 18:00.714
gunnery mission. My first mission was against 
Japanese bomber on December the 18th. But I had

18:04.518 --> 18:06.660
done ground gunnery with a P-40. I hadn't gotten to 
the point where I did air-to-air gunnery, as a

18:07.000 --> 18:10.003
matter of fact. What did you think of the P-40? I 
loved it. As a matter of fact, first thing, I was

18:13.627 --> 18:15.289
back in the fighter. And it was an inline engine, 
you know, and looked sleek, powerful. You could

18:24.685 --> 18:29.551
turn a vertical dive and just go all out and never 
worry about anything coming loose. It'd

18:29.651 --> 18:35.519
terminate around 450-something like that miles 
an hour and hold together. How could you compare

18:35.920 --> 18:40.126
it, or would you compare it with the Japanese 
airplanes? Well, that's what I'll get into, if

18:40.146 --> 18:42.349
it's okay. Yeah, I'd like to do that. I didn't meet a 
Japanese zero until Van Goon in February. But I had

18:50.590 --> 18:52.754
utmost confidence in it. And the key thing, 
though, was the knowledge that Chenault had of

18:52.874 --> 19:02.549
Japanese zeros and Japanese tactics as a result of 
being in China so long. He personally taught the

19:03.310 --> 19:10.120
first guy that came over to the first contingent, 
and then, you know, he used them to teach us. But

19:10.781 --> 19:13.305
even at times, he'd come in and give us talk. 
personal talks. And we had pictures of the Zeros,

19:15.331 --> 19:21.557
and then the old man here, his personal 
experience. We were completely confident of what

19:21.577 --> 19:25.741
he was telling us. And we were given, you know, he 
was the master of the flying in pairs, too. He

19:34.810 --> 19:36.892
developed those tactics in the United States Air 
Force. He's a master of that right now throughout

19:37.012 --> 19:41.757
the entire Air Force of the world. always be at 
least two planes together. And

19:45.453 --> 19:55.307
he knew the characteristics, flat 
characteristics of a P-40 compared to Zero. Zero

19:55.808 --> 20:00.054
is an extremely maneuverable aircraft, very 
light. The first one may have had no armor,

20:01.316 --> 20:05.102
protective armor in them at all. And it had two

20:05.923 --> 20:11.271
7.2 caliber guns in them, a little bit less than a 
.30 caliber. We had two, we had four .30 calibers

20:16.204 --> 20:26.554
and a wing root of the P-40B, the first one we had, 
and two .50 calibers and a fuselage shooting

20:16.204 --> 20:26.554
through the propeller. And we tried to cock the .50 
calibers in a cockpit yourself, just manually.

20:35.022 --> 20:39.547
You know, the butt of the gun sticking right out in 
front of your shoulder. Whereas the the 430s and

20:41.457 --> 20:53.215
the wings, you cocked and primed with hydraulic 
buttons.

20:53.236 --> 20:54.858
Firepower, then. Oh, yeah. Oh, we had superior 
firepower. We had superior speed, definitely in a

20:57.082 --> 21:02.470
dive. What about flat out? Flat out at altitude, we 
were just about equal. As a matter of fact, at

21:10.700 --> 21:15.184
extreme altitudes, 0 to 21,000 feet, we were sort 
of at a disadvantage of zero. We were a little bit

21:15.204 --> 21:16.965
faster. But in a dive, the zero would have a 
terminal dive that was slower than us. We were out

21:23.912 --> 21:26.174
diving. But we wouldn't dare turn with it. So we 
were given a tactic to use against the zero. That's

21:33.685 --> 21:36.008
what we practiced and trained with. You couldn't 
turn as fast as that? Every turn, come in, hit and

21:37.550 --> 21:41.456
run tactics. Hit and run tactics, keep up a high 
airspeed, and of course you could come in in the

21:41.636 --> 21:59.441
initial attack with a superior altitude, hit and 
break off, then go out, then come back, trying to

21:41.636 --> 21:59.441
reclimb into the altitude. Try to maintain 
altitude, though. and stay away from them from the

22:01.175 --> 22:04.980
standpoint of horizontal maneuvering. And if 
they do happen to get on your tail, split us out and

22:05.561 --> 22:12.830
go into a high-speed dive to pull away from them. 
And that's the way we fought them. And I have nine

22:16.274 --> 22:21.421
and a quarter victories. I'm almost a double ace. 
Well, we're going to get to that. We're going to get

22:26.127 --> 22:29.511
to those victories. But I wanted to know now about

22:29.930 --> 22:39.281
when was your training completed? Let's get back 
to the narrative. My training wasn't completed.

22:46.470 --> 22:55.260
And many of the pilots in my contingent, as a matter 
of fact, I think, if I remember correctly, there

22:46.470 --> 22:55.260
was one or two pilots that had not taken back. Every 
pilot, we had about 15. 68 pilots at that time might

22:58.634 --> 23:24.405
continue came over at about the 68th pilot there 
was one more contingent the incident was in route

22:58.634 --> 23:24.405
and got just about the wake island on december the 
7th and they turned it around saying back home that

22:58.634 --> 23:24.405
would have included the other 32 policies you 
would have had your hundred right but they sent

22:58.634 --> 23:24.405
them back home but so we started out with 68 pilots 
And at that time, we probably had about 50 of the

23:24.942 --> 23:35.632
airplanes, 55 or maybe 60 of the airplanes, of the 
100 P-40. And I had, like I said, I think I had 12

23:36.993 --> 23:39.295
hours. And I have an old Chinese log book that I 
still keep. So you had 12 hours of training. 12

23:45.721 --> 23:52.907
hours of NAP-40 total on December the 7th, which 
included some gunnery missions. See, I had a total

23:53.275 --> 23:55.097
of about... When was your first mission? You mean 
actual combat? Yeah. When were you first sent out

24:00.281 --> 24:05.385
to engage the enemy, if you did or not? On December 
the 7th. Of course, we went on December the 7th. We

24:10.129 --> 24:11.110
got the news. Pearl Harbor was hit and all of us were 
shocked. Well, we immediately worked all night

24:12.832 --> 24:17.796
long, armed our guns full up. We were ready to go to 
work because we thought we were going to be hit four

24:17.816 --> 24:21.539
days over. And we immediately went on alert. In 
other words, you were not hit at all, your air

24:23.617 --> 24:27.222
bases? No, no. Even though they were out? Oh, okay. 
Oh, they knew exactly what we were doing. Oh, yeah.

24:32.730 --> 24:35.554
Matter of fact, they knew we were polished when we 
came through Surabaya. This stuff came out in the

24:35.574 --> 24:39.680
papers, the Japanese in the papers. We know about 
the American Volunteer Group that continued

24:40.000 --> 24:45.548
coming through on the way to China, I mean to Burma. 
We know where they're based and all, and said, you

24:46.008 --> 24:49.734
know, eventually we'll take care of it. But they 
were busy hitting Singapore, Philippines, They

24:53.165 --> 25:02.254
had no respect whatsoever. They didn't even worry 
about American volunteers. They figured, you

25:06.699 --> 25:13.406
know, that we were a polyglot mercenary outfit and 
that we probably wouldn't be able to find our way

25:06.699 --> 25:13.406
out of a paper bag. We learned this subsequently. 
Well, we went on alert, and of course, like I say, we

25:15.608 --> 25:22.615
were expected to be hit, but we They went to some, 
you know, Pearl Harbor, all hell broke loose. The

25:26.943 --> 25:30.268
United States was in a war, and then of course we got 
in a war against Europe, too. I mean, active power.

25:32.592 --> 25:37.639
Well, the fat was in a fire then, so some high-level 
conferences. This pushed up the schedule for

25:38.620 --> 25:42.105
Chenault considerably. And after some 
consultations with the British and the Chinese,

25:48.295 --> 25:50.138
Not the American, but the British and Chinese. 
Well, I guess America had to be in, because of the

25:50.158 --> 25:59.050
Lend-Lease airplane and all, but to my knowledge, 
it was primarily between the British and the

25:50.158 --> 25:59.050
Chinese. One of our squadrons, we had three 
squadrons, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Pursuit. One of our

26:07.543 --> 26:18.218
squadrons, I think it was 3rd Squadron, would go 
down to Rangoon with the idea of protecting the

26:07.543 --> 26:18.218
port for the Burma Road to push the client into 
China. The other two squadrons would immediately

26:18.923 --> 26:28.354
deploy up to Kunming, China, our main base that was 
being prepared for us in China, where we were all

26:18.923 --> 26:28.354
supposed to have gone. The whole group should have 
gone, planned where. And we were going to go, I

26:31.938 --> 26:37.085
think, planned where in the early part of 1942 we 
would have gone to. Is that right here? Yes, yes.

26:42.111 --> 26:44.213
Sorry, our error. Here's Kunming right here. Tom 
Boo is right here just south of Young Yim here, and

26:48.303 --> 27:01.723
south of Mandalay, and that's where we were 
training here at Rand Goodman. And so you flew up

27:02.004 --> 27:03.486
and over there? Up and over the hump, that's the 
north part of the hump. And when did you fly over the

27:06.671 --> 27:08.694
hump? In December, we deployed up to Kunming on the 
14th December 1941, and on the 18th of December

27:16.450 --> 27:26.203
1941 was my first taste of combat. Okay, now before 
we get into the first taste of combat, tell me about

27:26.563 --> 27:31.810
flying over the hump. Well, on that route from 
Canggu

27:40.615 --> 27:44.520
northwest to Kunming, you really don't fly over 
the hump. The real hump is between India and China.

27:50.367 --> 27:52.950
And of course, I've flown over that. But you just 
have no, in those days, no navigation aids

27:52.970 --> 27:57.796
whatsoever. In our P-40, we had that old 
commercial radio set for air-to-air RTT. but we

28:07.312 --> 28:09.154
had no nav aids whatsoever. The only thing we used 
was a map, and I learned to navigate all over China

28:09.454 --> 28:19.603
and Burma and India by nothing in the world was 
flying the contours of the mountains. The first

28:19.923 --> 28:25.107
time I ever flew over the hump was a P-40 with no 
contacts, I mean no nav aids. The first time you

28:25.127 --> 28:26.629
flew what? Over the hump. Oh, okay, over the hump. 
Actually, the first time I ever flew over the hump

28:29.751 --> 28:36.137
was in a P-43 later on, which I was India into China. 
But you might call this a partial flight over the

28:38.858 --> 28:54.481
southern part of the hump, because we did fly up by 
way of Lashio, which is just south of the Chinese

28:38.858 --> 28:54.481
Burma border, then almost due east to Kunming. So 
you do fly over the southern part of the hump, and

28:54.501 --> 29:03.154
it's just a forbidding area, no roads, no nothing, 
except you see the Burma, the Burma Road being

29:03.590 --> 29:11.464
built along the mountain to supply into China, 
southern China, because the Japanese blocked off

29:03.590 --> 29:11.464
the rest. Now that's where all the elite support 
was to go to China, that Burma Road. And that's what

29:15.371 --> 29:17.395
we were supposed to protect. Instead, that was 
supposed to be the mission of the American

29:18.357 --> 29:25.710
Volunteer Group, protect the Burma Road from the 
Chinese. I mean from the Japanese attack. Now,

29:29.206 --> 29:33.933
what were your feelings when you knew that you were 
now finally en route to combat? Just sheer

29:34.073 --> 29:37.819
excitement and eagerness. I was ready and hot to 
try. I just couldn't wait. How about the

29:42.546 --> 29:45.430
excitement of your other 68 colleagues? No, not 
68. Because a third of them went down south. Oh,

29:49.476 --> 29:50.157
they were. Did you have about 40 that went up with 
you? Yeah, about two-thirds of us went up. They did

29:55.245 --> 29:58.690
about three waves. The happier ones were the ones 
that went to Rangoon because they figured they

29:58.838 --> 30:06.150
were going to get to combat before we would. And 
they were much more excited. It so turned out that

30:08.894 --> 30:15.244
we, who went to Kunming, actually got the first 
take to combat. But within a few days, they at

30:15.325 --> 30:21.454
Rangoon really got involved in combat. As a matter 
of fact, it was the 24th of May. 23rd, 24th, just for

30:23.746 --> 30:25.809
Christmas. They really got tangled up, and from 
then on, it was every day that way. But you were

30:31.197 --> 30:32.139
excited. Oh,

30:32.179 --> 30:36.545
all of us were. We felt we were trained. We were 
confident.

30:43.495 --> 30:53.230
I felt like a highly trained, hot-to-trot, 
typical American Air Force fighter wing pilot.

30:53.480 --> 30:55.603
fight upon it. We were confident. We just couldn't 
wait to get in the fight, and particularly since,

30:57.525 --> 31:03.093
you know, they hit Pearl Harbor. Oh man, you know, 
we were fired up. And to me, a Jap was a savage, and

31:06.157 --> 31:09.721
there was only one way. Kidding. We were ready. 
Really excited. So, we just couldn't wait. And

31:18.893 --> 31:21.917
every minute that particularly when we get the 
Jimba, which is a Chinese air raid one, Jimba, air

31:22.437 --> 31:32.311
raid, which scrambled. Boy, I tell you, it was, you 
found yourself breathing hard. Okay, so you went

31:37.258 --> 31:39.421
up and you landed. What were the conditions when 
you landed at Kunming? I've seen some of the old

31:43.907 --> 31:46.951
pictures. There's an old one. Some old films that 
someone took right on the scene. Yeah, I can show

31:51.382 --> 31:53.567
you plenty of them. What were the conditions like 
at this era? The field at Kunming was a grass field,

31:56.754 --> 32:07.378
but it was a good 5,000 feet square, plus down one 
side of it, the eastern side of it, the Chinese

32:08.101 --> 32:19.376
coolies were building this huge, long, 5,000 
foot, about 300 foot wide runway in anticipation

32:08.101 --> 32:19.376
of bombers, you know, every bomber from the United 
States. And that just showed you how plans had been

32:19.777 --> 32:23.542
made. And it was a typical- Was that a stone runway? 
A typical Chinese construction, little broken up

32:27.387 --> 32:36.640
rocks by a Chinaman with a hammer. carried in 
baskets and dumped, and then following him was

32:36.940 --> 32:47.870
another guy with some pots with sloppy mud to pour 
on top of it, red clay. It would get hard. It'd be

32:49.611 --> 32:55.857
just, if you will, sort of a concrete mixture, and 
it made a stone runway, and it was about two feet

32:49.611 --> 32:55.857
thick. And that would hold a B-17 easy. As a matter 
of fact, B-17s and B-24s used that very well. They

33:03.724 --> 33:04.764
were building it then. We didn't use it. We used the 
grass off the side. They had our dormitories were

33:07.730 --> 33:12.815
just spotless. Each pilot had his own bunk. Just a 
little dormitory room, you know. But common.

33:19.601 --> 33:20.822
Everybody had their own little room? Everybody. 
By how large? My room was a little bit bigger than

33:24.646 --> 33:27.849
this. 12 by 12? Yeah, I'd say 12 by 12. I forget. 
Actually I'd say it was about nine by twelve. It was

33:38.961 --> 33:42.607
a cot, regular army type cot with a good mattress on 
it. Heated particularly at night in the coldest

33:45.071 --> 33:50.720
time. Well in the morning a little cooler, you'd 
come in about six o'clock with a charcoal brazier.

33:56.809 --> 33:58.592
That was heater room in the cold. We had lights. and 
common latrine facilities down the way. We had a

34:06.560 --> 34:17.950
common dining hall and a club, if you will, where 
the men and the officers, so-called officers and

34:06.560 --> 34:17.950
men, we had no real separation over there. This was 
some regulations and rules, very few, only an

34:17.970 --> 34:28.239
absolute medal had been put out by Chenault. I was a 
little bit surprised and wondering for a while how

34:30.374 --> 34:37.362
this thing was going to operate because there was 
no rules and regulations involved. You know,

34:37.382 --> 34:39.445
strictly military discipline then. And I was just 
wondering, and knowing what, having heard of

34:40.366 --> 34:50.037
mercenary outfits, I wondered, you know, maybe 
this is what this was. But it proved later on to me

34:50.057 --> 34:58.727
that we, in my opinion, the American Volunteer 
Group was not a mercenary outfit per se, I assure

34:50.057 --> 34:58.727
you. We were a well-trained, close-knit, 
extremely competent fighter group. What was the

35:10.007 --> 35:15.491
difference between a professional fighter group 
and a mercenary?

35:18.814 --> 35:26.961
The difference was ours was an outfit that held 
together and proved itself in combat. A mercenary

35:27.702 --> 35:29.203
outfit was from, if you will, civilian type 
commercial pilots, maybe one or two dishonorably

35:31.985 --> 35:55.362
discharged military type, maybe from Poland, 
Canada, one or two from the United States, even

35:31.985 --> 35:55.362
some Russian pilots with some beat up equipment, 
maybe some Chinese, I mean some Russian

35:31.985 --> 35:55.362
equipment, that just didn't hold together. We 
were a And like I told you recently, we were picked

35:59.575 --> 36:05.740
for the cream of the crop of the trained guys. How 
would you like to be, I put your question, how would

36:06.701 --> 36:10.084
you like to be a commander? You can't ask me a 
question. That's not fair. But I'm doing this

36:13.627 --> 36:16.169
rhetorically. And I'm a commander type of one. And 
I look back upon this. Here we are. Here is

36:22.675 --> 36:24.096
Chenault, the commander. And he just reaches out 
and picks trains very capably trained

36:30.727 --> 36:36.874
people for an air force. And then gives them an 
airplane, and he got made. Really, you would ask me

36:40.419 --> 36:42.101
about training a while ago? We didn't have a hell of 
a lot of training. We just indoctrinated each

36:43.322 --> 36:45.745
other. And then the problem was, of course, 
holding each other together. Well, and I

36:49.250 --> 36:59.502
actually- So that's the difference between 
mercenaries and- Okay, so you were really a

36:49.250 --> 36:59.502
well-trained group of professionals with 
outstanding equipment? To be the Chinese Air

37:02.171 --> 37:03.813
Force. Okay, okay. Now let's go back here. I want to 
ask you one question. We were talking about

37:07.798 --> 37:10.461
conditions, and you described your room. How 
about your food? The food,

37:13.364 --> 37:19.011
well, the food was good. As a matter of fact, it was 
American food, American-style food. Eggs, oh,

37:23.276 --> 37:25.539
eggs. We had, every once in a while they had fresh 
beef. And vegetables, you know, China, the

37:29.131 --> 37:33.135
Chinese have terrific vegetables. But chicken, 
they've got sick chicken in the line. We'd eat

37:37.759 --> 37:39.321
chicken morning, noon, and night. A lot of times I 
had fried chicken for breakfast. Really? Dude

37:41.743 --> 37:42.344
chicken. This was later on when it got a little bit 
difficult to get, during the war, got a little

37:42.604 --> 37:49.651
difficult to get other types of food. But 
generally speaking, the food was good, adequate.

37:54.255 --> 37:57.298
It was very good and adequate down in Burma. Well, 
what about... how you ate compared to how the

37:58.882 --> 38:03.369
average Kool-Aid or the average person ate? Oh, no 
comparison. We ate like, well we ate, actually,

38:04.410 --> 38:21.896
I'd say we probably ate better than the average, I 
know we did, we ate better than the average United

38:04.410 --> 38:21.896
States serviceman, let's say that rushed over to 
India or to Southwest Asia. We ate better. Because

38:25.160 --> 38:27.724
it was an established mass upon the Chinese

38:28.075 --> 38:34.586
logistic structure. They were already in place. 
And Len Leith was already shipping food over

38:36.609 --> 38:40.316
there. How'd you get along with your coolie? Did 
you have servants? Well, we had common servants.

38:47.528 --> 38:52.817
For instance, my little barber cut my hair for two 
cents. and we had to speak broken immediately we

38:53.185 --> 39:22.483
started you know broken Chinese and they'd pick up 
broken English we'd pick up broken Chinese and the

38:53.185 --> 39:22.483
cootie that would come in with my brazier in the 
morning he wouldn't even wake me up he'd just come

38:53.185 --> 39:22.483
in get the pot go out get the charcoal going and 
bring it back in and leave maybe I'd see him in the

38:53.185 --> 39:22.483
afternoon clean up the room we'd have paid them a 
cent the place was kept immaculate and laundry

39:23.122 --> 39:27.209
was, you know, you've always heard of Chinese 
laundromat. They did that every day, and we just,

39:27.229 --> 39:31.796
they'd pick it up. It was, in effect, we had 
homemade maids, and

39:32.797 --> 39:42.533
they provided the KP's for cooking. The grounds 
was kept neat, and the The structures were well

39:52.012 --> 40:00.020
built, plaster and- Did they serve you plaster and 
brick? Plaster, but adobe brick. Did the Chinese

40:03.604 --> 40:07.547
serve you when you ate dinner? Yes. Did they cook 
the food? They cooked the food and served it at the

40:09.169 --> 40:13.654
table just like an officer's club. As a matter of 
fact, we'd have a choice of menu of maybe two or

40:13.914 --> 40:17.838
three. Like in the morning we'd have eggs any 
style. Every once in a while they'd have a bacon

40:21.779 --> 40:30.329
that was sort of a local style bacon, but it tasted 
like bacon. Eventually we got American food and

40:31.211 --> 40:35.836
had American bacon. At lunch we'd have soup, 
always have soup. Sometimes have soup breakfast

40:41.443 --> 40:45.508
if you wanted to.

40:49.606 --> 40:51.288
Yeah, we got milk. I don't know where it came from, 
but at times we got milk and it was good.

40:58.758 --> 41:05.247
In between missions, did you ever have any time 
off, or was there a town nearby or anything? Yes,

41:05.267 --> 41:06.108
yes. And did you go into that town? How were you 
treated by the people? Yeah, we were in a town in the

41:09.613 --> 41:12.637
city of Kunming. Now Kunming, area-wise, is about 
the size of, let's say,

41:19.745 --> 41:25.493
geographic-wise and area-wise, say the size of 
Austin. But when I was there in the early part of the

41:25.513 --> 41:36.489
war, when some refugees had come into it, the 
population was about 400,000. We'd go into town,

41:38.451 --> 41:46.663
see we'd have regular training days, and about 
once a week we'd have a day off. had a few old jalopy

41:46.964 --> 42:12.718
type sedans that was at our disposal, and viewers 
would get together, go into town, and they had a

41:46.964 --> 42:12.718
theater with printed American, English 
subtitles, and very nice restaurants, some very

41:46.964 --> 42:12.718
nice restaurants, and other parts of the city of 
course over typical Far Eastern just pitifully

42:15.213 --> 42:26.309
poverty-stricken and bedraggled

42:15.213 --> 42:26.309
Chinese with eating on the sidewalk and streets 
were filthy, typical for East Sloan. And we'd buy

42:27.210 --> 42:38.927
maybe some satin coverlets to send home that you 
put over a, make a quilt with. Sure. Real satin,

42:39.668 --> 42:41.170
beautiful thing. with cars with sewn embroidered 
Chinese dragons on it. As a matter of fact, sent a

42:47.259 --> 42:49.162
lot of those. Pillowcases and things like that? 
Yeah. But other than that. Well, how'd you get

42:54.410 --> 42:56.513
along with the people when you went in? Our 
relations with the Chinese people were

42:56.754 --> 43:00.920
practically nil. Naturally, you know, driving in 
town, we had. A tragic time. Oh, yeah. And of

43:06.348 --> 43:10.735
course, driving down the street was the hardest 
thing in the world to get them out of your way. We

43:11.440 --> 43:13.502
continued on the horn. There were practically no 
vehicles in the city at all. Bicycles up to the zoo,

43:17.126 --> 43:24.854
but people mostly on foot.

43:25.255 --> 43:26.236
They knew who we were. The people really who minded 
to running the business of the city and the higher

43:27.437 --> 43:39.490
levels of Chinese population, they knew who we 
were and knew what our purpose was, and they loved

43:27.437 --> 43:39.490
us.

43:42.828 --> 43:56.438
The social stories were given by the governor, the 
mayor, some of the wealthier citizens, and some of

43:42.828 --> 43:56.438
us were invited for dinners. We didn't 
necessarily have to eat with chopsticks.

44:12.207 --> 44:15.652
We had our own, in effect, PX, if you will. It was 
small, as it was, but in a liquor store. To buy a

44:21.780 --> 44:35.177
bottle of liquor, I remember on Christmas Day in 
Chungking,

44:21.780 --> 44:35.177
yeah, no, Christmas Day in Kunming, I and two 
others paid $52 a barrel

44:42.987 --> 44:44.369
You were thirsty.

44:47.272 --> 44:51.918
That was George Burgoyne and Jim Costner again, 
the two I told you about. All three of us got in the

44:51.978 --> 44:57.265
same

44:51.978 --> 44:57.265
squadron. But every once in a while, the British 
would come in with a supply of liquor. And they were

45:01.831 --> 45:05.816
practically giving us for nothing, a ration. We 
lived comfortably. We had plenty of black

45:09.059 --> 45:10.421
clothing. And uniforms, there was no... What 
uniforms we... Well, we're going to get to

45:10.441 --> 45:17.371
uniforms and regulations. But before we do, when 
you went into town, did the people treat you well

45:17.451 --> 45:27.525
because they thought that you were there to defend 
them? Or how did they treat you? Well, our

45:29.427 --> 45:35.957
relations with the Chinese civilians, if you 
will, in town were, like I say, practically

45:29.427 --> 45:35.957
nailed. If we'd go into a store to buy something, 
communication-wise, English and Chinese, you

45:38.405 --> 45:42.430
know, we couldn't speak. Every once in a while, 
you'd run across one who would interpret, could

45:42.911 --> 45:46.355
speak a few words. But we'd haggle on prices, and 
generally they would give, just because of their

45:47.316 --> 45:58.571
respect for us, and they'd give us a terrific 
discount on something you would buy, for

45:47.316 --> 45:58.571
instance. Always gay and laughing, because they 
were happy, you know, these American heroes would

46:00.093 --> 46:08.243
come into my place and finish them. We were heroes 
to them, and particularly after we started

46:08.898 --> 46:14.565
shooting from our plant down. Now we became 
widespread heroes. Like Madam said, we were her

46:16.887 --> 46:21.373
little angels.

46:23.095 --> 46:24.176
They treated us well. I don't remember ever, ever 
any group, even when they're getting in maybe a

46:24.556 --> 46:37.892
drunken, two or three of them getting in a drunken 
riot, maybe in a local restaurant, never really

46:24.556 --> 46:37.892
any trouble coming from them.

46:41.787 --> 46:48.142
Whenever we'd go to a social gathering, it was 
similar to, let's say, one right here in the United

46:41.787 --> 46:48.142
States. It was just as nice a host and courteous and 
extremely happy to have us as guests.

46:57.344 --> 47:00.471
Some of them would, at times, we'd have an affair 
out at the base.
