00:03.153 --> 00:07.098
This is Debbie Parks interviewing Mr. C.A. Bonnen 
for the History of College Station Project, March

00:07.158 --> 00:17.970
25th, 1983, at Mr. Bonnen's house, Side 1.

00:25.659 --> 00:29.083
I think you can. I'd like to start with some 
background information. Where were you born?

00:40.878 --> 00:45.623
And

00:40.878 --> 00:45.623
were your parents from Illinois? What did they do 
for a living?

00:50.729 --> 00:51.950
So you lived on a farm? What kind of jobs did you do 
around the farm?

01:03.194 --> 01:08.702
doing chores and field work and so on. I didn't have 
to be somewhat older than Mary Hampton to do field

01:08.722 --> 01:19.880
work.

01:19.900 --> 01:28.453
After I finished high school, I was never on the 
farm anymore. What kind of education did you

01:28.473 --> 01:30.636
receive?

01:39.256 --> 01:43.280
And then I was out for a year. And then I went to the 
University of Illinois.

01:51.890 --> 02:03.803
I got two degrees there, a BS and an MS. And after 
that, I went

01:51.890 --> 02:03.803
to the University of California for a year. Did you 
get your PhD? No. see it as 1933 and

02:08.467 --> 02:24.585
all these federal jobs developed and I 
represented the experiment

02:45.727 --> 03:08.490
What

02:45.727 --> 03:08.490
were your degrees in? One of my first degrees was 
BS. And

03:15.697 --> 03:29.397
you worked on experiment stations that were... 
They were federally funded, is that right? But

03:35.986 --> 03:40.452
they were in association with different 
colleges? Yeah.

03:51.050 --> 03:52.011
So long ago. 30

03:52.031 --> 03:58.238
years. 50 years. 50 years.

04:09.210 --> 04:11.913
Well, what brought you to the College Station 
area? What's that? What brought you to the College

04:13.255 --> 04:15.557
Station area? Yeah, oh, for the job. And what job 
was that? Was

04:21.239 --> 04:41.721
it a teaching position?

04:44.724 --> 04:49.930
Oh,

04:44.724 --> 04:49.930
I see. And then later on you taught at the college? 
Well, almost from the start I taught one course

04:53.574 --> 05:03.666
and then that was my research.

05:06.049 --> 05:10.654
When you came to the College Station area, what 
year was that? 1927.

05:15.120 --> 05:19.545
Where did you live?

05:20.285 --> 05:25.934
For two years out there in Bryan, you couldn't find 
a place out here. There was a small scattering of

05:25.954 --> 05:32.323
houses south of the campus. And two years later, we 
moved. And they told us about the house they were

05:40.175 --> 05:44.922
living in. And so we got out here south of the 
campus. In 1929? What was it?

06:05.758 --> 06:14.369
We came to Bryan in 25, I think, 27 when we moved out 
here on campus. Where did you live? What street was

06:15.431 --> 06:17.393
it on?

06:28.257 --> 06:38.310
Well,

06:28.257 --> 06:38.310
do you remember

06:28.257 --> 06:38.310
what subdivision it was in? Was it in College Park? 
College Park, yeah. Do you remember any

06:42.976 --> 06:49.945
communities that had developed out here?

06:56.202 --> 07:06.477
a number of houses in what we called College Park 
and West Park.

07:07.399 --> 07:13.728
This section hadn't been developed

07:07.399 --> 07:13.728
yet. We bought a lot here in about 1934 or 1935 and 
built this house in 1936. What subdivision is

07:24.839 --> 07:26.661
this? This is...

07:27.703 --> 07:34.412
Is this Oakwood? Yeah. Oakwood. Do you remember 
any rural settlements out towards south of town?

07:46.348 --> 07:51.976
Perhaps in...

07:46.348 --> 07:51.976
Yeah, no. This is all country. I don't know. Were

07:56.075 --> 08:03.721
there any farmers on the farmland? Do you remember 
any specific communities?

08:23.885 --> 08:26.948
Do you remember any communities in this area? 
Well, the, what we now call the North Gate,

08:27.769 --> 08:42.025
it was the first developed,

08:27.769 --> 08:42.025
such as it was. And

08:42.045 --> 08:51.175
then south, to the south there was the Oakwood 
community. And

08:51.847 --> 09:21.339
there was a development west of here.

09:21.360 --> 09:21.820
I think it would be the

09:29.714 --> 09:36.881
See, this is the Oakwood,

09:29.714 --> 09:36.881
West Park or whatever it is. Around what used to be 
the lake, there's a stream that runs through

09:36.901 --> 09:41.726
there. I don't know if you ever noticed it. Yeah. 
Well, that was the lake at one time. And the child

09:50.775 --> 09:52.938
around him. Oh, really? And there was a diving 
board extended. I don't know if you ever noticed

09:58.023 --> 09:59.164
that. Embankment runs across there now, but there 
was a diving board off of that embankment. And a

10:08.961 --> 10:15.048
small child went out on the diving board and fell 
into the lake and ground. And there were several

10:16.649 --> 10:19.372
children with her. You know how children are. They 
don't know what to do.

10:25.939 --> 10:28.982
They're grand circles around here. There

10:29.688 --> 10:37.875
were people living just a short distance.

11:07.859 --> 11:35.773
When

11:07.859 --> 11:35.773
you lived in the subdivisions before 
incorporation, How did you pay for your

11:36.614 --> 11:39.679
utilities?

11:44.908 --> 11:45.689
Did you pay? I don't know. There was a corporation, 
maybe

11:47.853 --> 12:01.896
about five or six men, that developed

11:47.853 --> 12:01.896
these houses south of campus.

12:14.971 --> 12:21.159
was incorporated.

12:21.179 --> 12:42.726
And these men ran the corporation and

12:21.179 --> 12:42.726
made

12:21.179 --> 12:42.726
all the decisions about it and so forth before they 
were born. Before 1938, the town college station

12:42.746 --> 12:43.847
was incorporated. Then you paid them for the 
utilities? Okay.

12:53.442 --> 13:00.892
What were the streets like at that point?

13:00.912 --> 13:04.757
Well, just gravel roadways and all. Okay. Do you 
remember where the sewer plant was located?

13:15.113 --> 13:16.835
I'd like to talk about incorporation. Do you 
remember some of the factors that brought about

13:17.496 --> 13:24.144
the incorporation of College Station? Well,

13:24.164 --> 13:33.354
that history is rather interesting because it 
shows how aggressive Bryan was. That's when they

13:33.374 --> 13:40.803
moved right out almost to College Station and took 
in all that. See, at one time, our school district

13:45.725 --> 13:53.964
Went clear to the Y, if you know where that is, where 
the roads come together and divide. Yes. All that

13:57.031 --> 14:02.704
country here into the Y was in our school district.

14:11.948 --> 14:15.651
which, of course, takes a little time. They 
immediately moved down, took in all that

14:15.671 --> 14:22.898
territory between here and there. And, of course, 
they weren't able to go anywhere else. There

14:26.241 --> 14:32.106
wasn't any other place for us to go but Sound.

14:32.126 --> 14:39.093
And, of course, they,

14:32.126 --> 14:39.093
what do you call it? They creeped around. It's an

14:41.227 --> 14:56.010
area that's been flooded once in a while. It's east 
of here. Oh, it's east of here. Is it Carter Creek?

14:59.175 --> 15:01.058
Carter Creek, yeah.

15:07.737 --> 15:30.730
We

15:07.737 --> 15:30.730
have

15:07.737 --> 15:30.730
to go across that to, you know, where they 
developed that.

15:30.750 --> 15:33.154
Where this big shopping center is out east here. 
Oh, yes, Post Oak. Post Oak, Bookwood, Post Oak

15:35.076 --> 15:37.660
Mall. That's a recent development.

15:59.527 --> 16:01.729
Yes, I can imagine. So as far as incorporation was 
concerned, the people decided that they wanted a

16:01.749 --> 16:09.518
city? Well,

16:10.539 --> 16:25.855
they knew if they didn't incorporate,

16:10.539 --> 16:25.855
Brian would eventually incorporate the whole 
thing and it wouldn't get any bigger. the railroad

16:27.573 --> 16:30.376
station in the city of Bryan. So they were afraid. 
Yeah. We had good reason to be afraid of that. Bryan

16:39.666 --> 16:45.452
has fought the development around the campus here 
from the beginning.

16:51.318 --> 16:55.943
You're talking to someone who has lived through 
all that and feels pretty strong about it. Well,

16:57.610 --> 17:01.356
that's what I'd like to talk about. People around 
here were afraid that Brian would. Oh, yeah. Brian

17:06.764 --> 17:08.066
was very aggressive. And of course, while we were 
unincorporated by taking anything they wanted. I

17:17.159 --> 17:25.812
imagine the college kept them incorporating 
campus. So

17:29.175 --> 17:38.309
we decided that the only thing we could do was to 
incorporate them. They immediately

17:40.232 --> 17:47.904
incorporated all the development community. And 
at that time, our school district went right to the

17:48.044 --> 17:54.634
Y, where the Y are.

18:07.709 --> 18:10.231
why didn't people want to be annexed into Bryan?

18:13.074 --> 18:14.976
Well, there's a lot of history back to that. You 
just got to...

18:14.996 --> 18:34.114
Of course, in the beginning, there was nothing but 
a railroad station here and the campus. And...

18:44.345 --> 18:51.534
The city of Bryan kept growing closer all the time. 
And the minute we decided to incorporate, and of

18:52.215 --> 19:11.078
course that takes a certain amount of time, they 
incorporated all the land north of campus.

19:13.218 --> 19:32.885
I don't know what the

19:13.218 --> 19:32.885
position of the regents was at that time, but

19:13.218 --> 19:32.885
apparently they couldn't incorporate the 
campus.

19:35.649 --> 19:43.039
So they came about as close as they could come with 
their incorporation.

19:44.757 --> 19:54.252
Of course, the village, it took them longer to 
incorporate themselves than it would have been.

19:54.452 --> 19:59.319
Brian just, all they have to do is, we're moving 
here. This is open territory, you see. Well, had

20:03.546 --> 20:11.558
the community developed some kind of feeling of a 
separate... Oh, yes. Yeah, very distinctly so.

20:15.710 --> 20:32.162
And of course, if you're a part of Bryan, it took in 
all the Mexicans and Negroes and all that sort of

20:15.710 --> 20:32.162
thing, and this is pretty much it. college 
community. And so you wanted to be your own

20:38.296 --> 20:42.260
separate community.

20:45.584 --> 20:45.684
Sure. Who were the organizers of incorporation? 
Do you remember? Well, I can remember two of them.

20:53.232 --> 21:03.904
Mr. Gabbard, my next door neighbor here, who is 
dead now, and George Wilcox, who moved away from

21:04.981 --> 21:08.607
the community. I think he moved to Dallas or 
someplace like that. Not

21:11.131 --> 21:19.084
recently, but fairly so. And then a fellow by the 
name of Benny was mayor and was killed shortly

21:19.905 --> 21:29.200
after that. Those three are the only ones I recall. 
I'm sure you can get the names of the rest of them.

21:40.526 --> 21:44.590
Well, how did they go about encouraging 
incorporation?

21:48.274 --> 21:50.196
Well, I didn't have anything to do with that. Mr. 
Gabbard was

21:51.518 --> 22:00.368
interested in the city, or at least that's what we 
agreed on. I went. My activities were involved

22:02.481 --> 22:04.625
with the school. I had six children and he felt like 
it. I would have more interest in the school than he

22:13.040 --> 22:15.485
would have. So

22:16.647 --> 22:22.137
we divided the

22:25.745 --> 22:28.848
They had a business up between the school and the 
city. I went to the school and he went to the city.

22:33.673 --> 22:35.275
Were there meetings? Did y'all have meetings to 
discuss? Oh, yeah. A lot of meetings.

22:43.623 --> 22:48.187
I can't tell you much about them. Where were they 
held?

22:52.171 --> 22:55.735
Well, we had a school out here.

22:59.208 --> 23:14.247
The

22:59.208 --> 23:14.247
meetings were either in a public building or in the 
home of one of the persons who were in the meetings.

23:20.909 --> 23:22.951
It was all very primitive, you know. Was it kind of 
word of mouth, or did they post signs that there

23:25.674 --> 23:31.199
would be a meeting?

23:35.423 --> 23:38.286
I don't remember about that. Do

23:38.306 --> 23:47.155
you remember the petition that was circulated to 
ask for an election? No, I don't remember that. How

23:50.170 --> 23:58.401
would you say the board of directors or the faculty 
on campus felt about being incorporated?

24:01.946 --> 24:05.431
I wasn't aware of any protest or anything like 
that. Were they in favor then? They must have been.

24:16.445 --> 24:23.636
You brought up the fact that Dr. Benny was one of the 
active members, and he became the first mayor. Can

24:24.277 --> 24:31.229
you give me any information about him, why he was 
interested in developing the city?

24:34.414 --> 24:40.984
Well, I just know that that group initiated the, 
the activity that led to the incorporation. I

24:47.147 --> 25:01.624
don't

24:47.147 --> 25:01.624
know anything about their position and so on. They 
must have all been for it because they got together

25:04.086 --> 25:12.456
and arranged for the incorporation. Do you know 
anything about the man? Can you remember anything

25:15.921 --> 25:17.463
about him? Benny? Not much. He was killed right 
after he was, shortly after he was elected mayor.

25:29.957 --> 25:31.379
Right out the east gate.

25:34.683 --> 25:37.125
Probably had his mind on something and drove out 
there. What's that? It was a car accident? Yeah.

25:41.530 --> 25:43.793
What happened with another car? I presume so. It 
was right there at the east gate and he must have

25:45.240 --> 26:02.532
driven out into the, see there wasn't much traffic

25:45.240 --> 26:02.532
here then and he probably had his mind on 
something. And he was in an accident? Well,

26:06.520 --> 26:16.332
apparently you were head of a committee after he 
was in the accident to try to find or to encourage

26:06.520 --> 26:16.332
somebody else to run for mayor. No, I hadn't. See, 
all my activities have been with the school. Do you

26:23.240 --> 26:27.726
remember talking to Frank Anderson about running 
for mayor?

26:32.852 --> 26:35.295
No, I don't think I had anything to do with that. 
He's a good friend of mine. I'm sure I voted for him

26:37.022 --> 26:40.405
and so on.

26:44.269 --> 27:00.623
I

26:44.269 --> 27:00.623
didn't take much of an active part in the city 
itself or what they did or what they were going to do

26:44.269 --> 27:00.623
and that sort of thing. I left that to my neighbor, 
Mr. Gerber.

27:10.426 --> 27:18.537
Mr. Anderson was the second mayor, and could you 
tell me why people would want him for mayor? What

27:18.617 --> 27:19.939
qualities he had? He was an outstanding 
individual.

27:26.008 --> 27:31.135
See,

27:26.008 --> 27:31.135
he came here.

27:40.463 --> 27:58.422
head of the A&M track team

27:40.463 --> 27:58.422
shortly after he came and .

28:07.092 --> 28:23.850
stood for than I do, but I had a son on the track team, 
and

28:07.092 --> 28:23.850
he was a very sincere, very fine individual. In 
fact, they named the A&M track

28:26.032 --> 28:32.259
Anderson Track now. That's right, I saw that.

28:38.260 --> 28:46.893
And that was well justified.

28:46.913 --> 28:54.183
I'd like to talk about the education, the public 
school system in College Station. You were on the

28:55.585 --> 28:58.690
school board for several years. Do you remember 
what years you served the school board? Well,

29:03.417 --> 29:07.643
the school was was on the campus until 1940, 
February 1940. And

29:15.489 --> 29:33.596
Bill Sparks, I don't know whether you ever heard of 
him or not, but he was a real estate man and a very

29:15.489 --> 29:33.596
fine individual. And he and I raised the money.

29:39.213 --> 29:42.739
build the first school off the campus. Off the 
campus? I don't remember. There were a

29:46.765 --> 30:05.997
lot of little country schools around and they were 
all consolidated with College Station School.

30:08.778 --> 30:11.462
I don't remember anything about that. It was done 
before I came on the school board. See, I

30:20.397 --> 30:32.917
helped raise the money for the movement of the 
school, the campus, and then in 44 I was elected to

30:20.397 --> 30:32.917
the school board. And how long did you serve? until 
1959, 44 to 59, 15 years. Do you know of any of the

30:43.057 --> 30:51.048
other communities that were consolidated with 
College Station? Well, all these little

30:51.829 --> 30:54.874
districts around us were.

30:57.938 --> 30:58.579
There you go. I think after they were 
consolidated, there wasn't anything but our

31:00.938 --> 31:11.971
school and Wellvern and then down in the end of the 
county. And they were eventually taken into the

31:13.393 --> 31:20.081
Navasota School District.

31:20.101 --> 31:22.003
What's the name of the little town down below? 
Milliken. Milliken. Milliken. That was all taken

31:24.246 --> 31:25.367
in. They were closer to Navasota than they were to 
Do you remember the school on campus? Yeah, it was

31:37.459 --> 31:48.462
a, stuck, stuck a building

31:37.459 --> 31:48.462
in a part of what is now the

31:55.310 --> 31:59.554
where the Aggies lived, the dormitory. It was a 
stucco building. I

32:01.156 --> 32:10.025
imagine there was five or six rooms in it. And then 
there was an old dormitory on the campus. I forget

32:14.790 --> 32:20.035
the name of it, but you can find out what it was.

32:22.968 --> 32:25.892
Was it Pfeiffer? Pfeiffer Hall, that's right.

32:31.019 --> 32:37.569
Do you remember what they called a teacherage, a 
place where teachers lived? No, I don't remember

32:38.089 --> 32:39.511
that. I saw a reference to that and wondered about 
it. I think that must have been before I came here.

32:50.086 --> 32:55.453
Did professors teach in the school that was on 
campus?

32:58.498 --> 32:59.259
In the public school? No. No. Your children went to 
the school that was on campus, is that right?

33:08.452 --> 33:14.300
Can you tell me a little bit about, you said that you 
helped raise the money to locate the school off

33:08.452 --> 33:14.300
campus. Can you tell me a little bit about that?

33:23.785 --> 33:36.014
All I remember about it was that Bill Sparks and I

33:23.785 --> 33:36.014
were appointed to the job of raising this money.

33:39.301 --> 33:40.444
See we had no

33:49.047 --> 33:51.832
This is College Station because it has the name The 
Depot. That's where we got our name.

33:59.444 --> 34:00.987
Did you not have any taxes? Did you have taxes?

34:06.355 --> 34:08.038
Not until we were incorporated. So you and Mr. 
Sparks had to raise the money, is that right? We had

34:15.558 --> 34:30.454
to double the valuations on practically all 
property to get the basis for the money that was

34:15.558 --> 34:30.454
used for the school. But this is not before you got 
the school moved off campus, was it?

34:43.088 --> 34:45.430
How is that again? What I'm wondering is that the 
school was located on campus, and you and Mr.

34:46.490 --> 34:56.714
Sparks and other men were interested in getting it 
off campus. Well, we were ordered off the campus.

35:01.144 --> 35:03.469
The university ordered us off the campus. Okay, 
and there was a school board, and how did they have

35:03.652 --> 35:11.023
money to run the school? I mean, apparently you 
needed to raise the money to move the school off

35:11.063 --> 35:15.991
campus. Could you tax the people at that time? I 
don't remember about that. Okay, so the school

35:21.579 --> 35:25.385
ordered you off. In the spring semester of 1943. in 
1940.

35:37.873 --> 35:42.961
So you and Mr. Sparks helped raise the money to 
locate the school. Do you remember the people,

35:44.683 --> 35:53.376
were the people submitting money to buy land? Is 
that what it was?

36:08.603 --> 36:11.407
I'm sorry to be so slow.

36:15.493 --> 36:17.196
You get to be 86 years old. I did pretty well when I 
was 85, but since then I've

36:18.097 --> 36:30.696
been pretty slow at recalling things.

36:34.135 --> 36:35.276
You know, it's heck to be old. I can imagine. But, 
you know, that's fine. Quite all right.

36:46.028 --> 36:54.378
As I can remember in my research, money was donated 
and the Hollick Lane track was bought.

36:59.844 --> 37:02.147
You mean that's south of campus here? Mm-hmm.

37:10.703 --> 37:15.649
Well, a man by the name of Clark, F.D. Clark, I think 
it was, who was college prof, and also a real estate

37:20.963 --> 37:24.330
man. And he developed all this out of the campus. He 
was of that group that developed College Park and

37:31.063 --> 37:41.925
then on south.

37:46.225 --> 37:48.127
That's about all I remember about it. It was in the 
hands of people like that who had charges of

37:48.727 --> 37:54.713
development. Remember, this was a comparatively 
unorganized community.

38:05.323 --> 38:14.511
And

38:05.323 --> 38:14.511
there was five or six men that formed a corporation 
that

38:19.283 --> 38:28.618
all the land west of

38:19.283 --> 38:28.618
this development here.

38:33.846 --> 38:45.865
And then Burgess and Sparks and

38:33.846 --> 38:45.865
another fellow whose name I don't recall, but who 
was killed shortly after they were organized.

38:56.789 --> 39:02.977
He was killed in an automobile accident south of 
here. And Sparks and Burgess were at a card party

39:02.997 --> 39:08.003
that night. And they got word while they were at the 
card party that

39:19.510 --> 39:20.371
And he was killed. And

39:20.411 --> 39:26.359
Burgess said, George, I just bought him out this 
morning. And that's the first sparks Neil got. And

39:30.705 --> 39:41.058
the sparks

39:30.705 --> 39:41.058
cut loose from Burgess and went over here and 
developed across the highway. College Hills

39:41.278 --> 39:42.480
Estate?

39:45.295 --> 39:57.801
It

39:45.295 --> 39:57.801
wasn't Redmond. Mr. Redmond built that. Redmond 
Terrace.

40:17.965 --> 40:30.524
All these things happen that are run by somebody 
else that I didn't have anything to do with. It's

40:30.544 --> 40:31.586
hard to remember. It's hard to recall.

40:38.316 --> 40:46.048
See,

40:38.316 --> 40:46.048
Brian came out and incorporated

40:48.053 --> 40:56.924
most of that land

40:48.053 --> 40:56.924
where they are now and cut us off there.

41:03.092 --> 41:15.647
Brian seemed to have the, they were incorporated 
and had all the knowledge of these things.

41:16.505 --> 41:18.768
take advantage of us whenever they wanted to. You 
can probably understand why we feel so bad about

41:21.211 --> 41:26.058
them.

41:30.163 --> 41:34.529
We wouldn't give them a meal unless we had to. Let me 
stop right here.
