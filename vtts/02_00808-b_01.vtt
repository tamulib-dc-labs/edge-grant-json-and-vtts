WEBVTT

00:10.392 --> 00:16.721
Interview

00:10.392 --> 00:16.721
with Mr. B.A. Anderson, side three. I had 
difficulty in finding previous correspondence.

00:27.156 --> 00:36.850
And it seems that all the correspondence was 
placed in a folder or folders, placed in the box and

00:27.156 --> 00:36.850
put up on the closet. A year later, you didn't know 
what box contained what. You didn't know where to

00:40.919 --> 00:42.843
look for anything. So I realized that we needed to 
come to some standardization of material by the

00:44.145 --> 01:03.062
various departments then, I mean the police 
department and all the rest of them, and that file

00:44.145 --> 01:03.062
designations would be appropriate so that, like 
you explained, if you wanted something, you know,

01:03.346 --> 01:26.009
a week or a month or five years from now, if you're 
looking for personnel or personnel matters, it

01:03.346 --> 01:26.009
would be in a personnel file, not a file with 
mechanics or, you know, any other function of the

01:03.346 --> 01:26.009
city. So I proposed this scheme

01:31.645 --> 01:36.031
But it met with a lot of resentment on the part of the 
city. You know, people don't like to change. And

01:39.997 --> 01:48.349
they were doing things one way, and they just 
didn't like it. I also proposed at the same time the

01:48.369 --> 01:56.941
establishment of a library with a certain code. I 
don't know whether you found it. I think that's

01:58.784 --> 02:00.927
what I found, the code. Well, I had two. Oh, okay. I 
had the library, you know, with the stuff that we

02:03.385 --> 02:13.140
wanted to file, plus the correspondence. Okay. So 
maybe I didn't see... Well, there were two. And the

02:16.505 --> 02:19.569
library books were one thing, and then the... I 
forgot what...

02:24.917 --> 02:27.541
The library, I think I used the code of the... I 
don't know now. I think it was a regular library

02:29.695 --> 02:36.065
code, a Dewey Decimal adapted from something or 
other. I know I spent a lot of time working that up

02:37.487 --> 02:47.763
and working the file system, because I wanted it 
for the file system particularly. Because police

02:47.783 --> 02:53.492
matters shouldn't be put in a folder with 
administrative matters and then The Parks

02:53.978 --> 02:58.003
Committee would be thrown in here and then put in a 
box. You couldn't find anything. So that's when,

03:01.907 --> 03:06.713
really, I started to save my own files. Because if 
anything was important in order to protect

03:06.753 --> 03:14.662
myself, I had an extra copy made and put it in my 
file. I can tell you about the 911 telephone that I

03:14.682 --> 03:20.809
had worked up. And that's another thing that I'm 
feather in my cap in a sense. I'm glad to see that

03:26.137 --> 03:30.943
materialize. But that, I forgot the year that was 
started and why. Maybe that's when we started to

03:37.872 --> 03:40.535
have these problems. I don't know the year. Right. 
But that was. But see when When the soup came along

03:49.261 --> 03:55.631
and all this, everything just died down. And 
everybody lost those on the council. They just

04:01.360 --> 04:03.563
lost interest. They didn't have the interest that 
they did before. Because you can't go gung-ho with

04:07.149 --> 04:13.439
that hanging over your head. That's right. feel 
that the city has gotten to a point where they

04:14.843 --> 04:19.369
really need to organize their records. And this is 
probably one area that they will work on in the

04:19.389 --> 04:22.914
future. And it's just a shame that it couldn't have 
been maintained. Well, this is the thing that I

04:27.761 --> 04:32.287
asked a little while ago about the needs. I could 
see that need. And I could see these needs in the

04:34.110 --> 04:37.094
cemetery and this and this. Because every time I 
looked around, I could see things that had to be

04:37.394 --> 04:43.062
done. That's why I threw together that five-year 
plan myself and just sent it out to 100 people. I

04:50.663 --> 04:51.484
know there was 100. And I had them critique it and 
what's wrong with it. Am I on the wrong track? What

04:58.151 --> 04:59.153
else do you want? What else do you think? To get 
their reaction. And I did it. I got

05:03.618 --> 05:07.382
it. But I'm sorry that never went through. But I 
still think it's a good idea. I do, too. Also, we had

05:13.670 --> 05:22.859
valuable books there, publications in the 
library that you didn't know where they were. At

05:22.879 --> 05:26.342
that time, we had the library in that back room. 
They were just thrown together and stacked up, and

05:26.362 --> 05:32.728
if you wanted to go in and look for something 
special, they were just there. Well, I couldn't

05:32.748 --> 05:35.570
tell you where they are now. I haven't ever seen one 
place where they have a lot of books.

05:42.627 --> 05:47.632
Were you also the first administration to work on a 
personnel manual? Right. Did you decide that the

05:48.252 --> 05:50.594
city needed it? That was one of my babies. Did you 
decide the city needed it? I almost wrote all of

05:54.999 --> 05:57.821
that myself. Or not wrote, I got it from, garnished 
it from other cities and everything else. And we

06:04.067 --> 06:06.089
were beginning to grow up. There was different 
regulations that abounded annual leave and sick

06:11.990 --> 06:20.122
leave and some were leaving personnel off and 
there were problems. Well, I understand that Joe

06:20.522 --> 06:28.894
got two days or four days for Christmas and how come 
I only got one? You know, the city employees also

06:28.914 --> 06:33.421
came to him with all kinds of problems. So that I 
knew, you know, I knew the workings pretty well in

06:34.242 --> 06:38.588
the city. because they felt that they could come to 
me and talk to me. Of course, I respected their

06:44.046 --> 06:49.493
opinion, but I wouldn't make any, you know, if they 
were wrong, they were wrong. And, of course, I'd

06:50.014 --> 06:57.283
speak to the department and follow them, but at 
least I got their side of the story. So until that

06:57.303 --> 07:02.450
point, the city employees never really, I don't 
know, organized? We never had many regulations.

07:05.114 --> 07:07.697
And what I was trying to do, I know it wasn't the 
best, But what can I, you know what I mean? I was

07:11.994 --> 07:13.817
working, too, with the university. Right, that's 
right. And I was given every available second to

07:15.199 --> 07:22.088
the city. And I wrote most of that. You know what I 
mean, or pulled it together. Right. Of course, I

07:28.656 --> 07:31.540
received a lot of criticism. Why? And I received it 
later, but... I didn't see

07:36.820 --> 08:05.511
them do

07:36.820 --> 08:05.511
anything for the other cities had one if

07:36.820 --> 08:05.511
you wanted to know what's the vacation schedule 
for the year the council You know, doing that. Is it

08:07.986 --> 08:11.030
something that the council normally does? Well, 
they set policies so that they'd say you get two

08:11.050 --> 08:23.148
days for Christmas or one for Thanksgiving or you 
get Fourth of July off or, you know, whatever it is.

08:23.168 --> 08:24.249
So they have to approve it? Yeah, they approve it by 
policy. They just say this is a holiday schedule

08:26.493 --> 08:29.757
for the city. A city manager... And then, well, he 
has to abide by the policy. Well, can he, or does it

08:35.234 --> 08:39.939
work where he formulates it in the city? Well, he 
could, yeah. In the city, okay. Well, you know, in a

08:42.561 --> 08:49.969
way, then, Rand Boswell was a little weak as the 
city manager. Well, I was going to ask you that. I

08:51.790 --> 08:55.274
don't mean to, I don't want this into any of the 
records. Okay. But Rand was a little weak, and...

09:00.605 --> 09:02.387
He didn't have much training in that. He was 
manager of a bottling company before he came. He

09:07.411 --> 09:09.153
served as a clerk. And there's a lot more that's 
left unsaid. But because of his weakness, I had to

09:14.038 --> 09:19.823
assume. I overstepped myself in my role as mayor 
because I wanted to get things done. I couldn't

09:28.211 --> 09:29.953
sit. I wanted to move. I wanted our city to move. So 
you'll see that I kept implementing things all the

09:34.312 --> 09:45.864
time with things that normally should have come 
from him as a recommendation. Well, was Langford

09:45.884 --> 09:50.949
then also a strong administrator, too? Was that 
something that Mr. Boswell would do, too? Well,

09:53.652 --> 09:58.337
see, they didn't have the things going as they did 
later on. You know, the city didn't have that much

09:59.549 --> 10:05.898
to do. We weren't growing that fast. But more 
things were coming up every day. You know what I

10:10.064 --> 10:10.905
mean? We were

10:10.925 --> 10:16.352
trying to get the city, you know, in many ways, 
going.

10:19.317 --> 10:23.382
And Rand was just not up to it. I mean, he just 
didn't... I respected him. I thought a lot of him

10:27.029 --> 10:34.642
personally, but he wasn't a good administrator.

10:34.662 --> 10:40.232
I know that I overstepped my bounds, but I just had 
to do it. Things had to go. I was ready to go. I wasn't

10:42.736 --> 10:45.942
ready to sit. I think my record substantially, I 
mean this weekly letter to the council on a

10:46.343 --> 11:02.166
Saturday tour of the whole city to answer any 
complaint from anybody on Sunday if necessary.

11:02.186 --> 11:08.335
You know what I mean, it was my city.

11:09.074 --> 11:17.987
Since I didn't have the opportunity to talk to Mr. 
Langford, I can only get from the records. And he

11:19.249 --> 11:27.681
was mayor for quite a bit of time, but yet the city 
wasn't as big and things were not going on. Well,

11:27.701 --> 11:28.803
they didn't have a problem. And I think the minutes 
will reflect that. That's right. Because, you

11:33.029 --> 11:36.955
know, I was on the council with him. Well, they 
were, I think maybe the most critical one was the

11:38.150 --> 11:46.339
page bill for the roads. That came up before Joe 
Wood, and that was during his tenure at that point.

11:59.274 --> 12:06.882
You know, this is out of sequence, but I meant to ask 
you, do you know why Mr. Langford decided to

11:59.274 --> 12:06.882
resign? I mean, he had... I've been the mayor for 
many years, but... I think he just got to the point

12:10.092 --> 12:14.198
where he was getting pretty old. Right. He'd been 
retired from the university for at least 10 years.

12:22.689 --> 12:27.897
And I thought, I think he was getting to the point 
where he just wanted to step down. He just wanted to

12:27.917 --> 12:28.578
live up to it. He enjoyed the honor because when he 
went to, like, league meetings, you know, he was

12:28.598 --> 12:36.709
always respected as the dean and players, you 
know, for his team. And he enjoyed that. He enjoyed

12:41.684 --> 12:46.112
getting that. But in his latter years, you know, he 
wasn't as active as he could be. Okay.

12:57.230 --> 13:01.077
We had been talking about the five-year plan. This 
and the Browns' plan seemed to me to be what you had

13:01.833 --> 13:10.443
termed a forerunner to a comprehensive city plan. 
And this happened after, this took effect after

13:11.264 --> 13:22.978
you were resigned, but the comprehensive, the 701 
plan, do you know what I'm talking about? Yeah,

13:22.998 --> 13:24.059
that came after. Was it something that you worked 
on at all? No, that... I think that came after, and

13:27.787 --> 13:36.159
it was just really a follow-up, you know, stuff we 
were doing right along. But most of the work on that

13:37.301 --> 13:42.828
701 was done by others. I want no credit for that. 
And yet a lot of things in your plans, your

13:46.674 --> 13:52.182
five-year plans, were incorporated. Oh, yeah. 
And are even incorporated in the 22,000. Yeah.

13:57.571 --> 14:11.426
Well, that was really my own ideas, too, you know, 
that I just, you know, as you keep around in this

13:57.571 --> 14:11.426
field and that field and what they

13:57.571 --> 14:11.426
should be doing. But Mr. Langford never really had 
a point in talking about music? We've also talked

14:15.830 --> 14:27.162
about this earlier, too, but I found this very 
interesting, that during your administration,

14:15.830 --> 14:27.162
that College Station used federal funds for the 
first time, or applied for them. And were you

14:27.182 --> 14:29.164
behind the effort? Oh, yeah. I was with Langford 
during his term. We were all conservative, like I

14:34.810 --> 14:38.835
said earlier. But then it soon became obvious to 
me, as well as to others, that all the communities

14:38.855 --> 14:45.482
surrounding us College Station, Brine, and, you 
know, Hearn, and all the rest of them were getting

14:45.732 --> 14:56.624
funds, and we're just sitting here, and we're 
paying money out, and we're not getting anything

14:45.732 --> 14:56.624
in. And even though we didn't like it, we might as 
well start getting a little bit in return, because

14:56.644 --> 15:10.879
we needed a sewer disposal plant, and if we could 
get 40%, why, it's too hard for us to do. So if I

15:11.922 --> 15:22.172
remember, the sewer disposal plant was the first 
one

15:11.922 --> 15:22.172
that we, you know, it was the first federal project 
that we engaged in. Was that the EDA doing it? Yeah,

15:24.494 --> 15:26.776
yeah. Were you able to complete that, the sewer 
system? Yeah, yeah. And the reason why I ask...

15:31.841 --> 15:36.825
Well, that's something else. We found a baby down 
there one day. Somebody came down through the

15:40.169 --> 15:41.710
fire. Oh

15:41.993 --> 15:47.283
my gosh, you're kidding me. We don't

15:47.303 --> 15:51.792
know. It was

15:51.812 --> 15:56.942
examined by a doctor. I don't know how long it was in 
the water and so on. Probably some woman just got

16:00.489 --> 16:01.410
rid of it. And no one ever reported it? Oh yeah, it 
was reported. I've seen some funny things, you

16:05.332 --> 16:10.841
know, sitting over there. Well, was that 
mentioned in the paper? They

16:15.147 --> 16:18.493
kept that out? That's what I thought. Oh my gosh. 
That's just like building that water tower right

16:19.254 --> 16:23.200
down here. I only wish they'd called me at that day. 
They were going down with a lake at one of the

16:26.625 --> 16:32.154
towers, the tower at Watertown. And that big... 
drill that they were using i don't know how many

16:33.867 --> 17:00.297
feet down pretty deep well it dropped after we got 
down a certain distance and what happened it hit a

16:33.867 --> 17:00.297
pocket of sphagnum moss and everything else down 
there so they pulled it up well they found out the

16:33.867 --> 17:00.297
depth of that hole then pulled it up and of course 
sphagnum moss came up well i would have loved to

17:01.002 --> 17:11.612
some of that moss and look at it under the 
microscope just to see what trees, what pollen,

17:01.002 --> 17:11.612
you know, everything about that particular moss. 
But I didn't hear about it until the next day. What

17:14.776 --> 17:21.062
they did, once they hit it, then under the contract 
they had to get out, I think, ten more feet. And so

17:21.082 --> 17:24.005
they started to go beyond that hole. But it's 
surprising to think that there's a big old not a

17:30.550 --> 17:36.937
limestone cavern, but a cavern out there that had, 
you know, just full of moss. You know, spaghid

17:37.979 --> 17:40.382
moss. But I, the next day it was all dry and, you 
know, covered up. What does that mean when you say

17:47.029 --> 17:50.433
spaghid? Well, that means that in years past, or 
centuries past, during the upheaval, you know,

17:50.453 --> 18:00.405
the gulf, there used to be inland water. that

18:00.672 --> 18:09.165
somehow or other this got in there, and I don't 
know. But we could have looked at it through a

18:09.305 --> 18:11.769
microscope. We might have been able to tell what 
plants were there, see? What plants had been

18:17.558 --> 18:19.721
living at one time. Right, in that hole. In that 
hole. Well, that's just a little... You know, one

18:28.567 --> 18:30.029
of these things. I get curious about things like 
that. Oh, sure. That's what makes life so

18:32.392 --> 18:36.056
interesting. Yeah. Okay, I was a little bit 
confused. You had a bond election for water, and

18:42.764 --> 18:56.380
did you use that in connection with the EDA grant to 
build the sewer system and the water lines? Well,

18:57.271 --> 19:01.116
we had a sewer grant and a water grant. Oh, you had 
two separate ones. And we extended our water line

19:05.482 --> 19:11.771
and then improved our sewer disposal system. 
Actually, we enlarged the sewer

19:11.791 --> 19:23.667
disposal plant down there and put in a next room. 
Yeah, where that bed, where that, I forget the name

19:25.115 --> 19:38.392
of it, where it comes up, the water comes up, and the 
animal life lives down there. We put in another

19:38.492 --> 19:44.279
one of them. And we improved the sewer lines in many 
parts of the city. So we went ahead with these two

19:50.187 --> 19:51.949
things. Okay. After you left office, there was a 
grant, and it had to do with water and sewage, that

19:53.950 --> 20:04.180
was the government canceled on. For some reason, I 
don't know. Do you recall what I'm talking about?

20:07.503 --> 20:07.783
No. I don't know if it's in connection with this. 
Sometimes it's hard to keep up with all the...

20:10.586 --> 20:16.291
Well, when I went out, I was just depressed. For 
good reasons. For many reasons, because, you

20:18.954 --> 20:22.037
know, I missed... I lived in my city, and then, you 
know, to get out like I had to. As you know, I went

20:28.555 --> 20:33.122
four months without a check. Oh, well, I didn't 
realize it. I realized that you stayed on longer

20:36.567 --> 20:38.931
than me. And the wife finally told me

20:38.951 --> 20:46.322
one day, she said, I'm glad we went down long enough 
on principle. And so I just had to get out. Yeah. I'm

20:52.595 --> 20:56.600
glad

20:52.595 --> 20:56.600
I did. Of course, you were acquainted with the 
amendment that I worked on. Oh, yes, yes. 12 or 13. I

21:07.033 --> 21:08.334
can't remember the 12. 12, I thought. Well, 
everybody told me that I'd never succeed there,

21:10.136 --> 21:13.981
too. I said, who are you to get an amendment passed, 
a constitutional amendment? In Texas, people

21:20.995 --> 21:28.202
just, you know, turn them down and pass them. And in 
the first place, you'll never get us through the

21:28.222 --> 21:33.147
legislature. So I took that as a challenge. Now, a 
lot of this is not written down either, but I formed

21:36.009 --> 21:47.020
a committee and, oh, what's his name, was it Brian 
Eagle? He agreed to help me. Oh, I formed a

21:50.677 --> 21:57.205
committee of about 12 people. I did most of the 
work, though. I don't think there's a university

22:00.510 --> 22:04.255
or college that I didn't like personally. I must 
have spent close to maybe $1,000 of my own money

22:04.995 --> 22:17.732
getting a message out to student groups, 
organized labor, the blacks, Anybody that I

22:18.860 --> 22:21.764
figured had anything to do. A lot of people, 
people's positions were at stake. Not only those

22:27.092 --> 22:35.525
that worked for the university, but they took the 
county agents that worked for irrigation

22:27.092 --> 22:35.525
districts. In East Texas, they were on little 
boards way out in the rural areas of the state that

22:35.886 --> 22:41.655
were knocked out. They couldn't serve. They were 
the most knowledgeable people all throughout the

22:42.997 --> 22:47.263
state. and I enlisted their support and well I knew 
enough about the legislature because I had served

22:48.644 --> 23:17.622
on the Texas Municipal League and various state 
committees and then before the legislature and I

22:48.644 --> 23:17.622
knew Ben Barnes and I knew Gus Mutcher and they've 
been just kicked out here you know but at that time I

22:48.644 --> 23:17.622
knew them all and I knew the procedures And I knew 
who my friend mayors would be. So we got the ball

23:23.992 --> 23:26.776
going. I did get it through the legislature. Was 
that hard? Did you have any trouble? Well, you had

23:33.045 --> 23:35.449
to know what to do and how to do it. You know, who to 
see and what committees to go to. It wasn't hard,

23:43.220 --> 23:45.543
but yet it wasn't easy. You know. So we got it 
through the legislature.

23:52.676 --> 23:55.318
And I don't know that you know anything about 
legislating. Oh, do I know anything? Oh, it's,

23:57.621 --> 24:03.487
well, at any rate, I got it through the 
legislature. And it was put up for constitutional

24:03.547 --> 24:08.292
ballot. Then they told me . That's really when I 
accepted another challenge. And I was determined

24:14.799 --> 24:17.342
again. I might be down in defeat, but then I'm going 
after him, and which I did. And I sent out thousands

24:23.927 --> 24:33.719
of letters, and the Brine Eagle, this fellow from 
the Eagle, I forget his name now, he went from here

24:23.927 --> 24:33.719
to California. And that brings up, well, that's a 
notice point, but the Brine Eagle. But at any rate,

24:39.947 --> 24:46.975
this, he ran off something. one-page, full-page 
eagle on both sides about this whole program. And

24:55.616 --> 24:58.961
he provided me with all the copies I could use. And I 
made one little appeal for money. And I guess I took

25:04.388 --> 25:07.593
in about $150. That's all. Even I was surprised 
some people around here wouldn't donate one cent.

25:13.881 --> 25:15.703
But then I didn't bother. I was after something 
else. There was a principal in there. And so I

25:22.041 --> 25:25.366
started sending out these flyers. And I don't 
think I missed a student college, student body,

25:26.769 --> 25:33.259
you know, a union. I got that Texas Almanac out, and 
I mean, boy, I just, between this and my wife and

25:34.081 --> 25:45.379
another girl, I mean, boy, we sent letters out to 
everybody. And when it came up for a vote, it just

25:46.439 --> 25:50.083
passed. Now, it wasn't a high vote for it, but it 
passed. And then we won. And all of this now is over

25:58.372 --> 26:03.057
in the archives. They were quite interested in it 
and wanted to be sure that they got it over. Yes,

26:11.066 --> 26:11.426
sir. I looked at that. No, I still have some stuff in 
here. to put in there when I, you know, someday in

26:15.397 --> 26:21.264
the future, when I get ready. When sufficient time 
has passed. Yeah. I still got some stuff in my own

26:23.867 --> 26:25.770
pile. And I got some other succulent stuff, too. 
I'll hold that for

26:32.478 --> 26:37.424
now. OK. We were talking about federal funds, and 
you mentioned the water and sewer funds. Also, the

26:46.497 --> 26:57.194
HUD fund, is that right, that helped with 
providing housing for the, I guess, the lower

26:46.497 --> 26:57.194
class? Yeah, yeah. Well, at that, well, now the 
Catholic Church, you know, came in, but all I did

26:59.938 --> 27:05.787
was just support it. It was their project. Oh. I 
don't understand that.

27:15.556 --> 27:18.759
Oh, not housing development. It was something 
like Southgate, then? Yeah. Southville? Yeah,

27:22.282 --> 27:24.284
something like that. That went in, and there was 
some objection there at the time. And as far as I was

27:29.289 --> 27:36.776
concerned, I got with the bishop in Austin. You 
know what I mean. Again, I've tried to become

27:38.538 --> 27:44.263
knowledgeable on the subject one way or another. 
And

27:44.885 --> 28:09.626
I was convinced

27:44.885 --> 28:09.626
that it would serve

27:44.885 --> 28:09.626
a good purpose to have it, at least having looked 
over what they had done over in Austin, too. So I

28:09.646 --> 28:10.006
supported it. There was some objection there, and 
they finally went through with it. The one in Grime

28:11.628 --> 28:12.568
has not been a success at all. I mean, they've had 
fights and murders and, you know, all kinds of

28:12.588 --> 28:14.470
problems in the Grime area. Ours is still in 
effect? Well, it was under the sponsorship of the

28:19.096 --> 28:28.786
Catholic Monastic

28:19.096 --> 28:28.786
Sync in Austin. I don't know. I think we had some 
place in the past where

28:29.086 --> 28:35.633
they sold that one. I'm not sure. They've had more. 
These two were built about the same time. Was it

28:41.619 --> 28:41.959
using HEV? Yeah, I think it was. And is it a 
subsidized rent? Is that what it

28:46.241 --> 28:50.988
is? Yeah. Yeah. OK. Also, in the area of 
transportation, I think you hinted at this

28:52.009 --> 29:04.047
before, but the city applied for federal funds 
through the topics plan. Is that right? Yeah. But I

29:05.750 --> 29:10.497
don't think we ever got anything.

29:10.517 --> 29:11.037
I didn't meet another one. Was that for 
signalization? Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. That was

29:17.200 --> 29:22.911
pretty, now the highway department was handling 
that.

29:24.774 --> 29:26.958
I know they had to approve everything. Yeah, they 
were the ones that were allocated the money, as I

29:28.081 --> 29:34.693
recall, to dish out. I'm not sure, maybe we did, but 
I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Well, as I was reading

29:40.865 --> 29:52.660
the minutes, I may have extended past your term as 
mayor, and they signalized the lights maybe right

29:40.865 --> 29:52.660
after you resigned, is that? Maybe, could be. Or 
maybe, I just forget. Well, I do remember there

29:56.204 --> 29:58.487
was... in the minutes and talked about Joe Hanna 
coming on, if he could. Yeah, he was District

30:04.107 --> 30:07.161
Engineer, yeah. And at first, College Station 
turned down funds to have their lights signaled

30:07.765 --> 30:21.766
because they were upset that, I think, like, only 
one light or two lights were going to be

30:07.765 --> 30:21.766
signalized, whereas in Bryan, they had a whole 
school of lights. Yeah. They didn't think it was

30:22.046 --> 30:25.091
proportionately fair. And then Mr. Hanover came 
to talk to them, and I believe they had the signal.

30:32.902 --> 30:33.082
Yeah. I forgot. All right. Thank you. Maybe so. You 
know, some of these things are a little hazy now.

30:39.363 --> 30:39.703
All right. Also, another one that, another 
project that I found real interesting is the

30:40.104 --> 30:46.890
Rubber Street project. Do you remember? Oh, yeah, 
that rubber and glass? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, you

30:52.836 --> 31:02.646
know, that was just some other innovative thing, 
and that was, I forget his name, that ground-up

30:52.836 --> 31:02.646
rubber, and... We had a few streets, well, they're 
still messed up.

31:11.132 --> 31:16.298
From an engineering standpoint, they weren't put 
in properly. And the minutes will reflect, I

31:16.438 --> 31:25.209
think, where I objected to it at the time. This was 
when we had that pay as you go. And this developer

31:30.195 --> 31:33.679
wanted to put in concrete streets. That's way 
back. And he wanted to put it on clay without

31:39.483 --> 31:50.197
reinforcing.

31:50.217 --> 32:03.514
And if you'll notice, I objected to this procedure

31:50.217 --> 32:03.514
because I didn't think that the concrete would 
hold together on clay and bounce around. Yeah,

32:03.574 --> 32:04.375
it's fine. And I was assured by some engineer that 
you don't know what you're talking about. You're

32:09.748 --> 32:16.036
not an engineer, highway engineer, and you don't 
know anything about concrete. And at any rate,

32:16.056 --> 32:23.706
White, it was agreed that he could go ahead and put 
five inches of concrete on top of Clay. Well, the

32:24.087 --> 32:27.491
end result is as you see it back there. Do you ever 
drive in that? What street? Oh, Westover and all

32:31.897 --> 32:34.260
that area down there. And there were huge cracks 
and everything else. Well, this seemed then,

32:38.457 --> 32:52.018
there was one street, this seemed like a good 
opportunity to take one of these streets and try

32:38.457 --> 32:52.018
this rubber and glass. I think it was glass, too, 
wasn't it? Or was it just rubber? I don't know.

32:57.267 --> 33:01.834
Well, sometimes it was a, let's put it in the name of 
a stretch. It was a mixture of ground and tires.

33:09.575 --> 33:10.596
Yeah. So we, and then this fellow from the 
university, and he was, his reputation was on the

33:10.616 --> 33:27.212
line, and you know, PhD, and he seemed to know, you 
know, had highway experience. It was with TTI. so

33:30.653 --> 33:53.961
we agreed to go ahead and let's try this stuff out so 
we tried it and we didn't have two months or he

33:30.653 --> 33:53.961
didn't have two months success in laying he had 
some problems with the machine but uh be that as it

33:30.653 --> 33:53.961
may why we finally put it on a screen or two up there 
And it never really, it never really found out. It

33:59.295 --> 33:59.796
didn't? No, no. Were you using federal funds to? 
Yeah, I think we did have, he had, yeah. It was his

34:07.304 --> 34:10.248
project primarily. But you allowed him to go ahead 
and use. Oh yeah, yeah. But the project paper

34:13.872 --> 34:16.775
really didn't work out. No. It sounded like such a 
good idea. Yeah, well it did to us too, you know, and

34:18.998 --> 34:23.543
you're grabbing at straws because You had an area 
like that. The only other alternative was to tear

34:25.599 --> 34:29.846
up the whole street and redo it. Now, instead of 
putting that concrete on clay, if they had come

34:30.427 --> 34:42.346
along and put gravel or sand to cushion it, see, and 
let it move, and let it move back and forth and up and

34:30.427 --> 34:42.346
down, they didn't do it. And I think you find in the 
minutes where I did object, I always said that.

34:49.645 --> 34:53.250
They told me I didn't have any sense and I didn't 
know what I was talking about. You didn't have the

34:53.351 --> 34:56.675
background to answer that question. Yeah, so that 
was an interesting little project. In the area of

35:02.865 --> 35:11.097
recreation, as I understand it, you were very 
active in obtaining undeveloped land for parks.

35:11.482 --> 35:13.685
Well, I was trying to, yeah. I started this matter 
while I was mayor where we had that ordinance that

35:14.125 --> 35:30.086
provided that a certain piece of that land had to 
go, or its equivalent in money, had to go for parks.

35:31.068 --> 35:31.588
From developers? Yeah. And I remember that 
ordinance specifically and worked hard for its

35:33.471 --> 35:39.919
adoption. At the time, I recall, we said it was 
unconstitutional and this, that, and the other,

35:41.671 --> 35:52.083
but other cities were playing it. So we passed

35:52.244 --> 35:58.131
it. And I think it was very fortunate because it 
enabled us at least to get little pieces of land to

35:58.151 --> 36:09.484
get the park system started. And that five year 
plan, didn't I have a large park of 100 acres? I

36:16.987 --> 36:18.689
forgot now what it was. I don't know what one thing, 
too, that isn't in the record, I don't think, is

36:20.370 --> 36:26.696
this. A&M used to get franchise tax from telephone 
use. And let's see, was it Dick Gilchrist as

36:34.924 --> 36:38.627
chancellor? I was

36:39.434 --> 36:51.372
always

36:39.434 --> 36:51.372
trying to get money from every possible source. 
The university was picking up, as I recall, about

36:52.273 --> 37:01.247
$4,000 or $5,000 a year out of a telephone 
franchise tax. That, in other cities, was going to

37:02.469 --> 37:05.273
the city. So I communicated with all cities in 
Texas

37:06.383 --> 37:24.323
that had a university in connection with it and 
determined that the franchise tax was going to the

37:06.383 --> 37:24.323
city, not the university. So I approached the 
university and they fought me on that, the

37:24.343 --> 37:33.593
university did. But we always had an 
understanding there. After it was all over, we

37:36.657 --> 37:38.459
won. Oh, you got franchised? Yeah. I really got a 
GTE and a buying because they knew Rudder and they

37:42.784 --> 37:52.674
were personal friends, you know, the president. 
And he didn't want anything to do to a fan Rudder.

37:57.780 --> 38:05.128
But I got him such a legal ground that he couldn't 
refuse but write me eventually. and tell me that we

38:05.615 --> 38:09.921
have the right to the tax. So we picked up that tax, 
which in that day and time was a lot of money. When

38:18.252 --> 38:25.461
you were, did you try to establish, well, let me see 
if I can phrase this right. It seems as though in

38:25.942 --> 38:30.087
your administration that the city, decided that 
there was a need for parkland. Is that a correct

38:34.018 --> 38:35.540
statement? Oh, yeah, it is. The council, we all 
agreed that we needed more parkland. And it was a

38:42.227 --> 38:44.630
matter of how we could get it. We had no people of 
wealth in our community. Like in Bryan, there were

38:50.056 --> 38:55.382
some people of wealth in years gone past, you know, 
that could donate land. but nothing like that in

38:56.240 --> 39:16.577
college and most of them worked for the university 
retired from the university so we needed more

38:56.240 --> 39:16.577
parkland to be sure but how do we get it and this idea 
of getting it through the real estate people or the

38:56.240 --> 39:16.577
developers it wasn't new because other cities had 
been doing it So we decided to approach this angle

39:17.519 --> 39:24.287
to get some of this parking. And we really didn't 
have too much money to go out and, you know, go out

39:24.307 --> 39:30.535
and buy it. Now we did do some investigating with 
the possibility of getting some federal funds, at

39:31.776 --> 39:46.294
least I did, because I had some Salt Conservation 
people and others come in to look over different

39:31.776 --> 39:46.294
tracks with this in mind. But nothing developed.

39:54.282 --> 39:59.148
Our heart was in it, but we never got around to doing 
it. Of course, I forget now the time and the events

39:59.168 --> 40:09.982
and the plays

39:59.168 --> 40:09.982
and things like this. Was Boyette against this 
developer dedication? I think this came after

40:16.109 --> 40:18.992
him. Yeah, I know it did. It came after

40:23.656 --> 40:27.660
him. Yeah, we were interested in parks because, 
see, they went with me, for example, on the Lincoln

40:29.362 --> 40:39.792
Center. Reluctantly. But they didn't. At

40:44.054 --> 40:57.647
that time, of course, we had, what, three centers 
of Negro activity. Now we only have maybe two, and

40:57.667 --> 41:02.712
they really don't amount to much anymore. But, you 
know, we used to have a larger population.

41:09.219 --> 41:09.459
Oh, really? How did the change to change to the 
council at large voting council council members

41:13.906 --> 41:38.715
at large come about instead of the lord's

41:13.906 --> 41:38.715
system well we figured at a time that we'd have a 
more representative

41:13.906 --> 41:38.715
government if everyone had an opportunity for 
everybody that went on the council We've got to

41:41.024 --> 41:58.695
consider that the wards, the early wards at least, 
were such that, like I said, we'd have maybe 15 or 20

41:41.024 --> 41:58.695
people vote in one ward and 160 vote in another. and 
there was no equity when they got to the council

41:59.317 --> 42:04.022
table. The one that had represented 20 people had 
as much, only as much authority, and the one

42:04.643 --> 42:16.335
representing six times as much only had the same 
voting purpose. So we, you know, was kicking

42:16.355 --> 42:27.467
around the idea that it might be better to have 
voting at large

42:16.355 --> 42:27.467
and to You know, everybody then would have a chance 
to, you know, name who they wanted the city

42:28.088 --> 42:36.460
council. And this is done, or had been done, in some 
areas. Subsequently, if I recall, the Supreme

42:41.407 --> 42:46.654
Court came along and said that this was Oh, we don't

42:46.887 --> 43:02.095
have it today? I don't think so. I don't know of a 
Texas city that... What is ours considered a place

43:03.909 --> 43:08.515
system? Yeah, place. You decide what place you... 
It's not necessarily where you live. It's just...

43:13.322 --> 43:14.784
Is that right? Yeah, that's right. And everybody 
can vote for you for that place? For that place,

43:19.070 --> 43:21.313
yeah. But I... In the essential, I'm the same 
thing.

43:28.583 --> 43:28.943
I don't know. I haven't heard any comments of late 
about our system. But I know in the early days, you

43:35.397 --> 43:39.182
know, that it just went one way and then the other. 
And the days before, boy, yeah, you know, that was a

43:39.242 --> 43:45.370
problem. When he would be elected from Ward 3 with 
only a handful of votes, don't you mean? Yeah,

43:50.396 --> 43:53.300
well, I know one of them went in with 12 votes. Oh, 
really? Yeah, for the council. And I went in here

43:57.565 --> 44:00.769
with about 120 votes. And somebody over in the 
south side would go in and say it was 210. And he

44:05.983 --> 44:08.507
couldn't have as much to say with 12 volts. And, you 
know, the two of us combined had, what, 40 times

44:09.889 --> 44:17.159
more than he did. So,

44:17.179 --> 44:26.032
you know, it caused people to sit up and take

44:17.179 --> 44:26.032
notice. And, well, it just went one way then the 
other. Were you, were you one of the people who

44:31.040 --> 44:34.884
pushed for the change? Oh yeah, when I had a lot of 
this inequity, yeah. And then particularly with

44:39.027 --> 44:45.453
Boyette, and then my inability to get anything 
done. I wanted something done, we had to move.
