00:02.309 --> 00:16.730
Talking about your teammates, what were the key values, attitudes, qualities you've learned of going to NM Soledad High School?

00:17.752 --> 00:19.795
What difference did it make as you look back?

00:21.260 --> 00:39.318
Well, I think that the people that were in A&M Consolidated at the time were a good cross-section of all kinds of people, and to me one of the real strengths that was there was the ability for all different kinds of people to get along together and enjoy each other.

00:41.260 --> 00:47.706
If all of those people could be present today, which ones would you want to thank most?

00:49.880 --> 00:57.450
Well, I think certainly the teachers, the administrators, and the kids at the same time.

00:57.650 --> 00:58.692
I enjoyed them all.

00:58.932 --> 01:00.554
But are there some names?

01:00.574 --> 01:01.295
Special names?

01:02.677 --> 01:07.563
Well, Miss Georgia Bell Landis was one of the teachers.

01:07.684 --> 01:09.526
Les Richardson was the superintendent.

01:10.828 --> 01:13.672
Boots Simmons was the coach.

01:17.757 --> 01:19.279
One of the...

01:20.677 --> 01:32.894
People that I think meant most to me in school was our homeroom teacher and I'm drawing a blank.

01:34.396 --> 01:40.945
But she was also our math teacher and I think I learned more from her than I did any teacher I ever had.

01:40.985 --> 01:45.672
And why can't I think of her name?

01:47.930 --> 01:51.315
Her son was named Charles Orr, Mrs. Orr.

01:52.316 --> 01:57.684
And Mrs. Orr taught me math, I guess, for about three years.

01:58.825 --> 02:04.052
And I always really enjoyed her teaching ability and what she taught me.

02:05.374 --> 02:08.719
Any mischief you can share that you were involved in?

02:08.739 --> 02:09.600
In high school?

02:11.555 --> 02:15.298
Well, we used to cut up in the science class every now and then.

02:16.339 --> 02:24.627
We would run the tubing around and stick it in somebody's pocket and turn the water on and do a few things like that.

02:24.727 --> 02:29.191
But I never got in too much trouble as far as high school was concerned.

02:29.391 --> 02:33.135
For high school age youngsters then, did y'all slip and drink any beer?

02:33.896 --> 02:35.437
I don't ever remember doing that.

02:35.517 --> 02:40.181
I don't ever remember drinking beer until after I graduated from college.

02:40.282 --> 02:40.802
Smoking?

02:41.390 --> 02:42.832
Yeah, it spoke grapevine.

02:44.735 --> 02:47.038
Did you even know the word marijuana?

02:47.238 --> 02:48.099
Didn't have a clue.

02:48.961 --> 02:50.703
Didn't know what it was.

02:50.723 --> 02:51.724
Did you have any wheels?

02:52.986 --> 02:53.267
No.

02:54.248 --> 03:00.797
After I got my license, I could take daddy's car on a date or something.

03:02.459 --> 03:07.887
And I did a little running around from that standpoint, but I never had a car of my own.

03:09.318 --> 03:12.485
Okay, now I think I know the answer to this next question.

03:12.525 --> 03:17.696
These are kind of the routine questions I give to people who grew up somewhere else.

03:18.858 --> 03:20.402
Why did you attend Texas A&M?

03:20.642 --> 03:23.007
Why not somewhere else?

03:24.505 --> 03:28.555
I think money was a big factor.

03:29.417 --> 03:32.143
I really didn't want to stray too far from home either.

03:32.865 --> 03:40.202
I kind of like the idea of being at home, but certainly cost was a factor.

03:40.182 --> 03:48.679
There wasn't any way in the world that Daddy and Mama could send me somewhere else to school, and it really just never occurred to me to go anywhere else.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.002
I never even thought about it.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.445
Did anybody recruit you?

03:52.387 --> 03:53.288
No, not really.

03:56.415 --> 03:59.922
I got recruited, well, that's not quite true.

03:59.982 --> 04:02.106
I got recruited by A&M.

04:02.086 --> 04:05.329
not on a scholarship basis, but to come play football.

04:06.691 --> 04:13.217
And I had watched my brother, and I decided that I was really too good to go out for football.

04:14.318 --> 04:17.781
And so it's a good thing because I wasn't any good.

04:18.262 --> 04:26.570
I wanted to play basketball, but Marty Corot said there wasn't any use in me going out for basketball, and so I didn't.

04:26.890 --> 04:31.755
And I did go out for baseball, but I didn't really care that much about it, so didn't do much with it.

04:32.360 --> 04:35.905
Did you know what your major was going to be when you started off?

04:35.925 --> 04:37.747
I thought I wanted to be a business major.

04:38.828 --> 04:43.734
Ended up with a personnel degree, but I thought all along I wanted to be a business major.

04:44.656 --> 04:45.477
And you lived at home.

04:45.777 --> 04:46.338
Lived at home.

04:47.079 --> 04:51.444
Describe what it was like for you living at home to be in the Corps.

04:52.426 --> 04:58.994
Well, being at home and living in the Corps, you were somewhat of an outcast, a day duck, as they were called.

05:00.716 --> 05:02.198
We had our own unit.

05:02.870 --> 05:19.867
of all Day Ducks, which was at that time mostly made up of marriage students, because a marriage student was really a little bit unique, and that also meant that we had a lot of veterans in that company, and the veterans didn't much want to do anything.

05:20.688 --> 05:25.052
I mean, they'd been through all that, and so there wasn't any need to do anything else.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.316
And so we weren't quite as formal

05:31.574 --> 05:40.744
as the other units were, but we still, of course, had to wear the uniform and do everything else like the rest of them did.

05:42.867 --> 05:48.913
And those were always, we marched in the parades and did all the other stuff that the units did.

05:50.235 --> 05:59.505
But it wasn't quite the same core activity, I really think, because of the veterans rather than the leadership as far as the core was concerned.

05:59.806 --> 06:03.130
So you didn't have to go make up somebody's bed.

06:03.870 --> 06:05.072
You didn't have a sophomore.

06:05.292 --> 06:05.612
No.

06:06.493 --> 06:08.095
And you ate your meals at home?

06:08.155 --> 06:08.755
Yes, I did.

06:10.517 --> 06:12.800
Do you have any idea what that freshman year cost?

06:12.820 --> 06:14.542
Yes, I remember very well.

06:15.463 --> 06:27.315
My fees my first year were $44 for the first semester and I had to go buy my books but my checked A&M was $44.

06:28.578 --> 06:33.584
And I meant to ask a while ago, do you remember what your dad's salary was at any point?

06:33.604 --> 06:33.945
Yeah.

06:34.546 --> 06:40.734
My daddy, because I talked to him one time that I just thought that we ought to have a new car.

06:41.915 --> 06:50.426
And my daddy showed me his check, which was $350, and said, here are the bills we have.

06:50.506 --> 06:57.555
If I had any way I could figure out how we should buy a car out of that, well, he'd be glad to do it.

06:58.733 --> 07:02.739
And that was after 35, 40 years service.

07:03.179 --> 07:03.880
Well, not quite.

07:03.941 --> 07:08.227
That would have been after about 15 or 20 years though.

07:08.247 --> 07:08.767
At A&M.

07:08.808 --> 07:09.268
Yeah.

07:09.669 --> 07:10.830
Oh yes, yes.

07:11.411 --> 07:12.052
Career.

07:12.072 --> 07:13.314
Right.

07:14.636 --> 07:19.543
Those freshman year courses, do any stand out in your memory of

07:20.890 --> 07:23.074
Yeah, several of them do.

07:24.236 --> 07:27.541
I had an English course.

07:28.663 --> 07:34.814
I made a D in English 101, was it 101?

07:34.854 --> 07:44.991
102, I believe it was, which was the first semester, and I made an A in 103, which was a difference in the professors.

07:44.971 --> 08:03.319
I remember biology under Dr. Doak, American history under Dr. Nelson, the military science courses were fun, and I really enjoyed the economic courses.

08:03.359 --> 08:12.193
Oh, I had, I had several, but I can't call any names, but, No, uh-uh.

08:12.494 --> 08:15.479
Describe Dr. Nelson's history.

08:15.499 --> 08:18.944
Well, Dr. Nelson was a very interesting character.

08:19.585 --> 08:22.369
He always had stories to tell.

08:22.389 --> 08:28.819
He always had antidotes and was famous for his pop quizzes.

08:28.879 --> 08:32.485
If anybody didn't show up, then we always had a pop quiz.

08:33.827 --> 08:37.793
And Dr. Nelson would write the questions on the board.

08:38.414 --> 08:44.262
and then light a cigarette, and when the cigarette was out, the quiz was up.

08:45.143 --> 08:50.089
But his class was always a blast to go to other than having a test.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.092
And he was nicknamed Screamin' Al.

08:52.112 --> 08:53.874
Screamin' Al Nelson.

08:53.894 --> 08:59.081
And he, I understand, was quite conservative in his politics.

08:59.101 --> 09:00.803
That would be putting it mildly.

09:02.065 --> 09:03.287
Very conservative.

09:03.307 --> 09:04.388
Describe Dr. Doe.

09:05.077 --> 09:11.023
Dr. Doak was a teacher who would adapt himself to whatever the class was.

09:12.604 --> 09:20.772
Mine was a general science class, and as a result he approached it in a very loose, friendly, funny manner.

09:22.434 --> 09:31.523
I never had one of the more advanced courses with him, but I understand in those courses he became much more serious and much more involved.

09:32.296 --> 09:35.902
But he was a very, very interesting teacher.

09:36.363 --> 09:37.925
He made everything interesting.

09:39.007 --> 09:42.794
And you go through and graduate within four years.

09:43.976 --> 09:49.926
During that freshman year, describe a typical class day.

09:49.966 --> 09:51.849
You got up at what time, did what?

09:52.189 --> 09:58.540
I would, nearly all my classes, I always wanted my classes as early in the morning as possible and nearly,

09:59.093 --> 10:12.916
I recall very few days when I didn't have an eight o'clock class and I would ride to the campus with my daddy and walk to class generally in the academic building or in the shacks.

10:13.016 --> 10:23.093
Herb Thompson was a, when I finally got to the business school, Herb was a great teacher and I enjoyed him very much.

10:26.093 --> 10:34.341
I would go to class and finish my class and then probably go to the Y and then go home with my daddy.

10:35.463 --> 10:36.283
You ate lunch where?

10:36.544 --> 10:37.284
Generally at home.

10:38.866 --> 10:40.868
Would you come back in the afternoon?

10:40.888 --> 10:44.752
Sometimes because I'd have a, occasionally I'd have a class in the afternoon.

10:46.013 --> 10:53.721
If not, I would, I don't know, do something at home or go play something.

10:54.224 --> 10:58.058
to fall in and march to chow like other fish.

10:58.730 --> 11:02.734
Did any upperclassmen ever give you a hard time?

11:02.754 --> 11:14.165
Very much so because the Day Ducks, well, they liked to quiz you and you get to class and they wanted all the stuff of what's my name and what company am I in and all that.

11:15.046 --> 11:19.110
They treated us, the Day Ducks, they liked to ride us pretty hard.

11:19.911 --> 11:26.678
And so it was pretty important that we learned who the people were and could call some of those names.

11:27.248 --> 11:33.619
If you had an unscheduled hour or two on the campus, where did you spend that time?

11:34.300 --> 11:41.413
Oh, generally either at the Y or I would go to the library quite a bit and go through that.

11:44.418 --> 11:47.524
But I expect I spent more time at the Y than any other place.

11:48.726 --> 11:51.771
Did you make some special friends?

11:52.696 --> 11:53.517
That first year?

11:53.837 --> 11:55.820
Yes, certainly so.

11:55.840 --> 12:06.614
A fellow by the name of Jim Dishman in Beaumont, Jerry Lastalick in Dallas, the Gibson brothers from West Texas.

12:09.537 --> 12:12.161
I remember playing against Jimmy Dishman.

12:13.162 --> 12:15.825
He was a Beaumont Royal Purple and I was an Orange Tiger.

12:15.986 --> 12:16.406
Oh really?

12:16.426 --> 12:21.032
Well I talked to Jim Dishman this morning on the phone.

12:24.860 --> 12:31.369
the Graves brothers, all pretty special people.

12:35.455 --> 12:42.145
Do you remember any good bull or pranks or jokes that you as a freshman got involved in?

12:42.165 --> 12:50.717
We got over to Austin for a basketball game one time and nearly got in a fight over there because we probably said the wrong thing to somebody.

12:50.797 --> 12:54.242
I don't know exactly what we said.

12:55.285 --> 13:00.652
Got involved a little bit when they went up and captured the Baylor bear.

13:01.153 --> 13:07.001
They couldn't get the big bear, so they got the little bear and tranquilized it and brought it down here.

13:07.061 --> 13:10.566
And the only trouble is the bear woke up just about the time they got down here.

13:11.767 --> 13:19.878
And I remember the guy driving down the road, swinging the car and trying to swat that bear as that bear was tearing his car apart.

13:20.819 --> 13:22.862
But I got involved in a few scrapes.

13:24.007 --> 13:28.313
Any drown outs or anything like that that you helped with?

13:28.333 --> 13:39.590
Yeah, I got involved with telling a couple of sophomores that they hadn't behaved right and doing some of that stuff.

13:41.873 --> 13:43.676
You mentioned some key faculty members.

13:44.497 --> 13:50.806
Would you share any faculty nicknames that you remember and why they were nicknames and what they were?

13:50.826 --> 13:53.490
Well, there was a guy with the name of Get It Greer.

13:54.584 --> 13:58.808
It was an English teacher and everything he would, said would get it, get it, get it.

13:58.989 --> 14:00.610
And of course, screaming Al Nelson.

14:10.661 --> 14:12.283
Let me think of anybody else.

14:12.303 --> 14:21.753
It was somebody in the... No, I don't, I don't remember.

14:21.853 --> 14:24.135
I had him as a freshman, never counting.

14:24.503 --> 14:25.805
And let's see, there was Judge.

14:27.187 --> 14:27.347
Stewart.

14:27.387 --> 14:27.848
Stewart.

14:28.669 --> 14:29.410
Judge Stewart.

14:29.430 --> 14:30.392
How was he called Judge?

14:30.572 --> 14:31.473
He was a judge.

14:31.854 --> 14:31.994
Oh, oh.

14:32.014 --> 14:34.358
He was an attorney and he was a judge in Bryant.

14:39.365 --> 14:40.587
I had him in class.

14:45.173 --> 14:47.076
But I can't think of any other nickname.

14:50.181 --> 14:53.025
Let's see, we've already talked about the why.

14:53.933 --> 14:56.578
The MSC really doesn't get going until?

14:56.598 --> 15:00.785
1950s, 49 somewhere.

15:01.406 --> 15:03.309
Did you get involved in any MSC?

15:03.570 --> 15:10.662
Yeah I was involved in the camera club over there and I think a couple of other organizations.

15:11.864 --> 15:18.996
I use the the camera club facilities some but there was a little bit of

15:21.777 --> 15:30.005
I won't call it friction, but there was a little bit of disagreement between the Y and the MSC over some things.

15:30.845 --> 15:39.333
And I can't tell you what, I don't remember, but I do remember not being too involved as far as the MSC was concerned.

15:42.496 --> 15:47.200
The, what did you, what did you and other students think about the MSC as a structure?

15:47.220 --> 15:51.244
We thought it was extremely impressive and probably un,

15:51.562 --> 15:57.670
non-typical of A&M, but that it was a very, very lovely facility.

15:58.110 --> 15:59.031
And it was air-conditioned.

15:59.092 --> 16:00.954
Yes, it was when nothing else was.

16:01.615 --> 16:02.436
And did that attract?

16:02.616 --> 16:03.157
Oh, yes.

16:03.197 --> 16:06.781
Everybody thought that air-conditioning was just a wonderful thing.

16:07.662 --> 16:12.068
Do you remember some, while you were an undergraduate, some big guy and hall events?

16:12.672 --> 16:16.796
Yeah, I remember, of course, the Religious Emphasis Week used to be in Guyon Hall.

16:19.418 --> 16:26.865
There were a lot of pretty famous people that came there to entertain.

16:26.905 --> 16:33.852
There was one of the female singers, and I can't think what her name was.

16:33.872 --> 16:35.413
Spike Jones was there.

16:35.453 --> 16:37.255
Kate Smith?

16:37.335 --> 16:39.777
No, it wasn't Kate Smith.

16:41.765 --> 16:54.359
It was one of the opera singers that came and... No, I'm drawing a blank, but Segoia was there.

16:54.419 --> 17:02.769
One of the ones I enjoy as much as any was Fred Waring.

17:04.831 --> 17:09.156
He was there.

17:13.253 --> 17:14.616
Tommy Dorsey was there.

17:14.636 --> 17:17.262
They used to have the big band, Ray Anthony.

17:18.484 --> 17:25.640
The big bands would come in and put on a concert and then play for a dance.

17:26.662 --> 17:30.951
You danced.

17:30.972 --> 17:32.595
As you began to have dates,

17:33.402 --> 17:35.946
Was it local girls or out of town girls?

17:36.267 --> 17:42.597
The only girl I ever had a date with in my life was Lou, other than maybe once or twice.

17:43.359 --> 17:45.923
Had a blind date while I was in A&M.

17:47.045 --> 17:49.849
We ended up being the beauty queen at the University of Texas.

17:51.893 --> 17:57.402
And I had a couple of dates in high school, but other than that, I never had a date with anybody but Lou in my life.

17:59.525 --> 18:09.246
So that you didn't, I've heard about Moose Pots and Beast Buckets and all with the Tessies in and everything.

18:09.266 --> 18:15.279
What were the, as you look back on it, what were the basic attitudes of A&M students in those days?

18:15.299 --> 18:19.288
I think basically still quite conservative.

18:19.775 --> 18:28.585
Most of them, one of the big things about A&M in those days was the fact that when you came to A&M you left everything else behind.

18:29.766 --> 18:31.969
You didn't bring a letterman sweater.

18:33.170 --> 18:42.421
You didn't bring any clothes from home because what you wore was the Aggie uniform and it really didn't make any difference what you're standing or anything else was.

18:42.461 --> 18:44.483
Everybody was the same once you got here.

18:46.302 --> 18:52.188
And were you even aware that there were some of your classmates who may have been rich?

18:52.888 --> 18:53.129
No.

18:53.369 --> 18:53.769
Or poor?

18:53.950 --> 18:54.210
No.

18:56.412 --> 18:57.953
This didn't make any difference.

18:57.973 --> 19:09.885
The big events were at Guyon Hall, Kyle Field, and Aware Field House.

19:09.905 --> 19:12.748
Describe, if you can, a typical...

19:13.319 --> 19:15.262
football day for you.

19:16.023 --> 19:20.088
What did you do during a typical football game, home game day?

19:20.108 --> 19:34.467
Well I used to go down on many occasions and work selling cigars, candies, wait a minute, cigars,

19:37.585 --> 19:40.148
Cigarettes, cigars, chewing gum, and candy.

19:40.949 --> 19:46.435
I knew the guy that had that concession, and I sold stuff in the stadium many a time.

19:47.976 --> 19:53.923
I used to love to go watch the special trains come in and see all the people get off in all the pretty clothes.

19:55.444 --> 20:06.276
So you, in a way, you were unusual on those game days that you didn't have to be part of the routine from the core dorms.

20:06.847 --> 20:09.269
Well, what I'm telling you really is earlier.

20:10.510 --> 20:11.111
Oh, oh, oh.

20:11.131 --> 20:17.457
A typical game day, as far as the games is concerned, is yes, I would march in with the Corps.

20:19.339 --> 20:22.461
And did you and your buddies have dates usually?

20:24.043 --> 20:28.547
Most of the time not, because Lou was in school at TSCW.

20:29.007 --> 20:33.171
And if she didn't come, I didn't have one.

20:33.812 --> 20:36.094
And you all communicated by letter or telephone?

20:36.715 --> 20:38.818
I don't remember many phone calls.

20:38.878 --> 20:41.100
We wrote a lot of letters.

20:41.281 --> 20:43.664
I'm not surprised because phone calls cost a lot of money.

20:43.724 --> 20:44.825
It was a different animal.

20:44.945 --> 20:45.646
In those days.

20:46.027 --> 20:47.869
That's right.

20:48.730 --> 20:52.535
G. Riley White comes in after you graduate.

20:52.795 --> 20:53.075
Right.

20:53.276 --> 20:53.636
Doesn't it?

20:54.637 --> 20:55.558
DeWear Fieldhouse.

20:55.599 --> 20:56.219
Tell me about.

20:56.359 --> 20:59.904
Well DeWear Fieldhouse was a wonderful place.

20:59.944 --> 21:06.452
As a kid I just thought that was the greatest place in the world, going there and watching them play basketball.

21:07.073 --> 21:11.660
NM used to have a tumbling team that would perform at halftime and that was always fun.

21:12.522 --> 21:20.334
And I always thought that it was fun the way the Aggies razzed the other team and the Aggie spirit that showed up in the basketball game.

21:20.675 --> 21:23.519
I always enjoyed the basketball games and I went to every one I could.

21:24.441 --> 21:32.153
Who were, during your days as a college, as a college Jew, who were your favorite athletes?

21:32.639 --> 21:34.644
Well, Johnny DeWitt.

21:39.157 --> 21:40.861
What was McDonald's first name?

21:43.288 --> 21:48.201
Jewel McDowell.

21:59.352 --> 22:11.624
I guess there were some of the football players and the baseball players, Dishman, Lastalick, Bill Munderland, Putter Jarvis, they're all pretty close.

22:12.605 --> 22:16.168
Were you aware of the existence of any secret fraternities?

22:16.509 --> 22:17.069
Never heard of it.

22:19.632 --> 22:26.338
Other than the, I don't remember when the new, there was a,

22:28.208 --> 22:34.195
The story broke about that at some point, and I don't remember when, but when it broke, that was the first I ever heard of it.

22:36.118 --> 22:40.403
Because I think it goes at least back to 1921.

22:41.825 --> 22:44.868
I never heard of it.

22:44.888 --> 22:45.349
Let's see.

22:45.770 --> 22:51.837
The student organizations that you and your contemporaries most respected

22:52.711 --> 22:55.835
other than the Corps, band, RVs, what?

22:55.895 --> 23:15.680
The band, the RVs, the battalion staff, at that point the MSC, what they call them, MSC something, council, the L leaders, the Corps staff, the band was way high.

23:17.222 --> 23:21.267
If you could have just for celebrity status had any position,

23:22.259 --> 23:25.265
what would have been the highest status a student could have had?

23:26.968 --> 23:29.874
I expect president of the student body.

23:29.894 --> 23:31.357
Oh, that more than corps commander?

23:31.598 --> 23:34.844
Probably so, yeah.

23:35.165 --> 23:43.221
Was there any geographic area or any academic major that seemed to have the inside of a student leadership position?

23:46.610 --> 23:59.191
I would say in those days that probably the major was the engineering major, more so than anything else, but I'm not sure of that.

23:59.571 --> 24:01.715
Did y'all have nicknames for the different majors?

24:02.156 --> 24:04.800
No, not particularly.

24:04.940 --> 24:06.002
I don't know that I ever heard that.

24:06.022 --> 24:09.748
What was supposedly the toughest major and the easiest major?

24:10.927 --> 24:16.556
Physical education was supposed to be one of the easier ones.

24:18.198 --> 24:24.648
Electrical engineering and physics were supposed to be, the EE major was supposed to be very tough.

24:26.130 --> 24:27.793
So was the School of Veterinary Medicine.

24:29.375 --> 24:36.185
Did you and your fellow students, did y'all feel that athletes went to class?

24:36.205 --> 24:39.330
No, to some degree, not a hundred percent.

24:41.032 --> 24:44.897
Let's see, you weren't part of Bryan Field.

24:45.558 --> 24:46.078
No.

24:47.560 --> 24:52.567
When you went somewhere out of town, did you ever hitchhike?

24:52.587 --> 24:53.348
Yes.

24:53.368 --> 24:55.170
Describe Aggie Hitchhiking.

24:55.190 --> 25:00.036
Well, hitchhiking had a very strong protocol.

25:01.999 --> 25:06.364
You couldn't go upstream at all.

25:06.766 --> 25:17.966
you had to know where the places were that you could hitchhike, and whoever was doing hitchhiking didn't mean it was his turn, it was just whoever was next.

25:18.988 --> 25:24.137
And I think the thing that impressed me about that as much as any was the protocol that went with it.

25:24.818 --> 25:29.466
Where, if you're going to catch a ride to Dallas, where was the place to go?

25:29.566 --> 25:31.710
If you're going to catch a ride to Dallas,

25:36.618 --> 25:51.980
I believe it was right north of... I believe it was at the main gate.

25:54.063 --> 25:59.731
Yeah, the east gate just to the left or the north of the east gate.

26:00.032 --> 26:04.498
And to Houston was just to the... It was a little bit south of that, about a block or so.

26:04.613 --> 26:06.736
What about if you're going to Austin?

26:06.756 --> 26:08.478
It was out at the edge of barn.

26:11.181 --> 26:14.585
Did you ever have a bad experience Aggie hitchhiking?

26:14.605 --> 26:14.805
No.

26:16.026 --> 26:17.728
I have not yet had anybody.

26:17.748 --> 26:17.809
No.

26:17.889 --> 26:22.935
Now, did you have any that, now that you look back on, were kind of amusing or goofy?

26:24.036 --> 26:24.496
Particularly.

26:24.597 --> 26:31.785
I hitched a ride in a truck one time, and that was kind of fun.

26:32.845 --> 26:37.870
But generally, the people were always very interested in what was going on and very courteous.

26:37.950 --> 26:41.053
And I don't ever remember any problem hitchhiking.

26:41.073 --> 26:43.156
Did you have a car while you were an undergraduate?

26:43.176 --> 26:43.376
No.

26:44.757 --> 26:45.898
What about summer jobs?

26:47.360 --> 26:55.669
Yeah, I used to work for an outfit called the Stanley Equipment Company, and we did refrigeration work and insulation work.

26:56.029 --> 26:59.072
And I guess I did that every summer I was in school.

26:59.592 --> 27:07.705
Went down and did some work on some of the docks at Lake Charles and Galveston, New Orleans, Mobile, Alabama.

27:14.796 --> 27:16.519
The courtroom experiences?

27:16.539 --> 27:20.305
Yeah, we had, as a freshman, I made all the court trips.

27:21.126 --> 27:22.869
Made most of them as a sophomore.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.633
I think I made some every year.

27:25.867 --> 27:36.239
but generally I would try to go north where Lou was so we could meet for that and go to the ball game, and we generally would end up staying with a friend or somebody up there.

27:36.259 --> 27:46.531
I remember a court trip or two to Houston, but Lou never did go to Houston, so I'd just go and go to the game and go home.

27:47.352 --> 27:51.837
Was the group ever treated impolitely?

27:51.857 --> 27:52.718
No.

27:55.145 --> 28:06.859
Any memories you have of a delightful Aggie victory when you were an undergraduate?

28:09.556 --> 28:15.004
And we beat Texas 22 to 21 here in, I guess, 52.

28:16.646 --> 28:18.349
And that was a wonderful victory.

28:19.190 --> 28:22.675
And I remember going to Austin and beating them in basketball one year.

28:22.695 --> 28:25.118
I don't remember which year that was.

28:25.439 --> 28:33.010
I remember we played Oklahoma home and home probably my freshman year.

28:34.151 --> 28:36.595
And Oklahoma came down here and we beat them.

28:37.336 --> 28:38.938
And that was always a lot of fun.

28:41.230 --> 28:44.655
How did you go to Bryan when you were an undergraduate?

28:45.036 --> 28:45.597
How often?

28:47.399 --> 28:49.102
Very seldom.

28:49.122 --> 28:51.986
You know, maybe once every two weeks or so.

28:52.427 --> 28:57.595
If you and your buddies were going to go have a good time on a Friday night or a Saturday night.

28:58.116 --> 28:59.037
Go to the picture show.

28:59.237 --> 29:00.539
Without your dates, where'd you go?

29:00.559 --> 29:01.441
Go to the picture show.

29:02.162 --> 29:02.623
The campus?

29:02.903 --> 29:04.926
Either the campus theater or Guyon Hall.

29:06.458 --> 29:08.060
but not downtown.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.402
Very seldom.

29:09.422 --> 29:16.972
What were the places that were on the edge of being improper for students to go to?

29:16.992 --> 29:20.998
Well, from our standpoint, hard lickers probably fell in that category.

29:21.859 --> 29:25.043
The Avalon Club on the north side of Bryan.

29:26.205 --> 29:26.786
Tell me about that.

29:26.806 --> 29:27.427
I don't know that one.

29:27.447 --> 29:29.369
You don't know that one?

29:29.389 --> 29:32.854
Used to be a big club at the corner of 21 and 6.

29:33.779 --> 29:43.514
called the Avalon Club, and it was considered risky as far as the students were concerned.

29:45.978 --> 29:47.700
Just a big beer joint dance hall.

29:50.084 --> 29:52.247
I don't know what happened to it, but it's not there anymore.

29:53.309 --> 29:57.095
Right, and it wasn't mixed drinks, and it wasn't women of, or it was?

29:57.295 --> 29:57.836
It was beer.

29:58.156 --> 30:01.862
Beer, but not mixed drinks, and it wasn't women of the evening.

30:02.787 --> 30:07.954
Was there any house of ill repute, supposedly, within... Not that I know of.

30:07.994 --> 30:09.557
No, not that I know of.

30:09.637 --> 30:11.299
Did Whiskey Bridge exist yet?

30:11.439 --> 30:11.780
Yes.

30:13.162 --> 30:14.103
Is that what y'all called it?

30:14.123 --> 30:19.891
Yeah, you had to go across the bridge, and what was the lady's name that owned that place?

30:20.673 --> 30:27.242
I don't remember her name, but there was a lady that owned that liquor store, and that was about the closest place you could buy liquor.

30:28.353 --> 30:32.578
And what would have happened at your house if your parents had known you had brought something back?

30:34.100 --> 30:34.580
I don't know.

30:34.720 --> 30:35.802
I'd have had a hard time.

30:36.743 --> 30:38.164
My folks didn't drink at all.

30:39.666 --> 30:42.770
And I just, I don't think that was even an option.

30:43.691 --> 30:45.333
I come from that kind of background too.

30:47.275 --> 30:55.485
Let's see, the president at the time you're a senior was him.

30:55.505 --> 30:55.845
Was that...

30:57.344 --> 31:00.342
Was Dr. Gilchrist gone?

31:00.362 --> 31:00.764
Yeah.

31:01.790 --> 31:02.414
Harrington?

31:03.561 --> 31:04.587
Probably was Harrington.

31:05.393 --> 31:08.598
Yes, I knew him very well.

31:08.758 --> 31:10.340
Describe him personally.

31:10.360 --> 31:28.047
Very friendly, very jovial, always glad-handing the students and always involved in a lot of things, but Tom was always very, very friendly and always seemed to be very helpful.

31:29.629 --> 31:31.913
You never had a chemistry class from here?

31:34.817 --> 31:34.877
No.

31:36.207 --> 31:40.665
Let's see, we've already done World War II.
