WEBVTT

00:03.406 --> 00:04.868
Today is April 28th. I will be interviewing Dr. 
Alfred D. Fowler. The location for this interview

00:10.156 --> 00:15.223
is in my office in the University Archives. Again, 
today's date is Tuesday, April 28th, 1981. One of

00:22.093 --> 00:31.506
the things I ran across in the interview, I was 
curious about, and it's not particularly

00:22.093 --> 00:31.506
important, Where did you first hear about the job 
at TFS? Was it advertised? At that time, I was

00:39.594 --> 00:44.620
working for the International Paper Company. 
There was some sort of a ceremony that took place at

00:45.861 --> 00:51.628
the Spring Hill Mill of the company. I can't 
remember now what it was. But...

01:02.401 --> 01:03.342
I attended. Maybe I just decided I wanted to go, or 
maybe I had gotten an invitation. I don't remember

01:09.769 --> 01:11.251
that. But at any rate, I ran across two foresters 
there from Texas. One was Balzer Koontz, who I had

01:20.421 --> 01:30.332
gotten acquainted with many, many years before in 
Florida. In the early 30s.

01:38.367 --> 01:51.824
He had lost a job during the Depression with Long 
Bell, who employed him originally in Texas and

01:38.367 --> 01:51.824
Louisiana.

01:54.307 --> 01:55.669
You've heard of the Long Bell Company? Okay. And 
Don Young, they... had known each other because

02:01.295 --> 02:09.985
Kuntz, when he left Florida, he married a Texas 
girl. He's a native of Indiana. Started at Purdue

02:13.349 --> 02:22.979
in forestry, then transferred to Syracuse, and 
then from Syracuse he got this job with Long Bell.

02:22.999 --> 02:28.045
And he had married a Texan, gotten acquainted with 
her in Jasper. Although her home had been in Fort

02:29.054 --> 02:33.219
Stockton way out west. At any rate, not a tree for 
miles. She

02:39.626 --> 02:52.221
had, well, when he was out of a job, I think that they 
voluntarily came back to Texas. He made a

02:52.642 --> 02:58.909
connection with the Texas Forest Service and then 
from the Texas Forest Service He went into the

02:59.834 --> 03:02.217
pupwood business. Well, he at that time was 
shipping wood to International Paper, the Spring

03:02.298 --> 03:07.105
Hill Mill. That's why he was there. And whether he 
and Young traveled over there again, I don't know.

03:13.314 --> 03:15.196
But anyway, I ran across these two fellows. And 
like all of us do, we jobbed home for a while. And

03:20.725 --> 03:26.533
Kuhn facetiously, I think, said to me, Well, I 
guess you know that there's a vacancy over here in

03:28.066 --> 03:36.961
Texas for the directorship of the Texas Forest 
Service. And Don Young chimed in, somewhat the

03:38.403 --> 03:43.331
same effect. At the moment, it didn't leave much of 
an impression with me because I was reasonably

03:43.992 --> 03:51.385
happy in the job that I had. And... A little while 
later, I thought it over after I left there, and I

03:55.117 --> 04:18.531
thought, well, maybe I'll put in an application 
for the job over there, largely because I

03:55.117 --> 04:18.531
recognized that my opportunity for any 
advancement in the International Paper Company

03:55.117 --> 04:18.531
was quite limited for two reasons. One, I hadn't 
been with the company very long. I was employed by

04:23.399 --> 04:48.397
the company in 19, end of 1945, after I came out of 
military service, largely because of the

04:23.399 --> 04:48.397
influence of Earl Porter, who was at that time in 
charge of procurement for the company in this

04:23.399 --> 04:48.397
southern region, and as one who was in charge of 
procurement, that is, of wood. He also had charge

04:49.419 --> 04:51.702
of land. But there was somebody immediately below 
him who administered land, a fellow by the name of

04:52.087 --> 05:02.381
Fogelberg, whom I had run across many years before 
in Florida. Well, at any rate, Earl

05:04.104 --> 05:10.573
Porter hired me. I had hired him during the CCC days 
while I was director of the CCC camps in Florida. He

05:19.065 --> 05:20.727
was out of a job or... was on the verge of being eased 
out during that deep depression. He was employed

05:26.942 --> 05:35.975
by the

05:26.942 --> 05:35.975
Foley Lumber Company at Foley, Florida. At any 
rate, Earl hired me, and then as time evolved,

05:47.403 --> 06:00.657
In the early, for the first two years, the 47th and 
48th, things went swimmingly for me in Winfield,

05:47.403 --> 06:00.657
where I was located in charge of IP lands west of 
Mississippi. But then younger men were also

06:01.858 --> 06:12.290
released from the military service, fellows who 
previously had been employed by IP. Well, I soon

06:12.890 --> 06:15.553
recognized that those younger men were going to be 
given better opportunities for advancement than

06:15.871 --> 06:28.930
I because of those two reasons that I mentioned, my 
age and not having had any previous experience

06:15.871 --> 06:28.930
with IP. I don't think times have changed too much 
now. I think you'd find the same thing if you were in

06:31.353 --> 06:35.299
that position in 1981 as you would have in 1947. 
Probably so. Probably so. It's natural, I guess. I

06:39.866 --> 06:40.406
suppose. But anyway, I'm not going to elaborate on 
that. Anyway, it's water. Yeah. So I had gotten

06:46.111 --> 06:59.804
acquainted, these fellows had told me that the man 
who would probably make the decision about the

06:46.111 --> 06:59.804
employment of a director was D.W. Williams. My 
ears came up like that because I had gotten

07:00.185 --> 07:06.411
acquainted with D.W. while we were both in 
military service. I got acquainted with him in

07:07.872 --> 07:15.139
1944

07:07.872 --> 07:15.139
in Shrivenham, England. Run that name by again. 
S-H-R-I-V-E-N-H-A-M.

07:21.883 --> 07:21.983
Okay. And Shrivenham was the place name of what had 
been the English equivalent or British

07:22.003 --> 07:40.160
equivalent of our West Point, but during the war it 
had no useful purpose anymore and was turned over

07:22.003 --> 07:40.160
to U.S. military forces. Is that where Sandhurst 
is located?

07:45.427 --> 07:52.033
I don't know, I can't relate to Shrivenham 
military installation with Sandhurst. I don't

07:52.653 --> 07:55.816
know where Sandhurst is or where it ever was. But at 
any rate, Shrivenham was a military

07:56.236 --> 07:59.078
installation. And I was told that it was the 
equivalent of our West Point, but I had no reason to

08:00.079 --> 08:06.124
pursue it. That's where we people who were in 
military government were being, I guess you could

08:15.903 --> 08:23.795
say, put in storage until there was a use for us. 
Until the Channel Crossing? Yeah. Do you remember

08:27.902 --> 08:30.506
the exact title of this command that you were in? 
Was it just military government or did it have some

08:30.586 --> 08:34.853
officious title? Well, let's see, the title I 
guess would

08:44.101 --> 08:45.342
At the moment, I can't remember. Okay, well, it may 
have just been that. But we had a designation of G5

08:47.444 --> 08:53.010
in the entire military structure. Okay, I bet I can 
find out. I'm not sure how important it is. I am

08:56.994 --> 09:02.000
curious to know about what you learned from your 
military experience. Did it help you in

09:02.560 --> 09:03.902
administration? Did you learn? No. You didn't 
feel like the military was beneficial to your own

09:06.384 --> 09:10.769
personal knowledge in any way? Could be. Might 
have been.

09:15.877 --> 09:25.331
I won't go into that, but I had a screwy experience 
in my military

09:15.877 --> 09:25.331
contacts with the military. Was D.W. over you? No, 
no. He was just there. He was just there. He had the

09:32.622 --> 09:37.309
rank of major, and I had the rank of captain. But we 
all had commissions. They were made up of entirely

09:41.115 --> 09:44.500
commissioned personnel. Those people are true. 
You never met Henry Kissinger, did you? Oh, Lord,

09:49.457 --> 09:50.178
no. He was in that. Yeah, but that was after the 
crossing and in connection with displaced

09:51.920 --> 10:01.874
personnel. I was never identified with that in any 
way. Did you stay with military government your

10:04.418 --> 10:07.622
entire time in the Army? No, thank God. It was the 
most screwed up outfit I've ever had my misfortune

10:10.346 --> 10:14.672
of Being a part of it. Then where to after military 
government? Well, I wangled a transfer to the

10:18.892 --> 10:22.858
Corps of Engineers. Ah, something you knew 
something about. In the Third Army, too. Pattons.

10:27.685 --> 10:27.845
Yeah. Were you all just attached to the Corps of 
Engineers? No, no. Do you really want me to go into

10:32.672 --> 10:34.194
these things? I'm just curious. I'm not going to 
write about it, but I'm curious. All right, I'll

10:36.657 --> 10:42.205
satisfy your curiosity because I like to talk 
about this. While we were driven and we were

10:42.225 --> 10:44.929
essentially killing time So we would wangle or 
there would be organized trips. And I was on a trip

10:50.429 --> 10:53.474
to Oxford. And I had remembered back from my days at 
Yale that Oxford had a course in tropical

10:53.494 --> 11:05.792
forestry. And on the faculty there was a man by the 
name of, what the hell, I don't remember at the

11:14.542 --> 11:18.166
moment what it was. So when we got to Oxford, I made 
it a point to find out where this School of Tropical

11:19.348 --> 11:33.805
Forestry was situated on the campus, and I went 
around there, and I learned that this man... I wish

11:35.227 --> 11:36.308
I could remember. It'll come back to me tomorrow. 
That's not important. He was in military service.

11:41.734 --> 11:43.857
He had the rank of brigadier. And

11:44.140 --> 11:52.069
he was in military service, and as a matter of fact, 
he was looking for some foresters. So this person I

11:52.329 --> 12:10.890
talked to at Oxford said, well, I carried this 
story around with me for a while, several weeks,

11:52.329 --> 12:10.890
and then I ran across a fellow also at Shrivenham, 
whose name I can't remember at the moment, this is

12:12.760 --> 12:20.771
my old age catching up with me, who had a greater 
rank than I. He had the rank of major then. Well, he

12:23.595 --> 12:40.658
picked up his ears, and through a whole series of 
odd circumstances, there was a unit within the

12:23.595 --> 12:40.658
engineer section at the Towsa level, ETOWSA 
stands for European Theater of U.S. Forces. There

12:47.563 --> 13:10.813
was a unit within that engineer section of ETOWSA 
created that would be composed entirely of

12:47.563 --> 13:10.813
graduate foresters for the purpose of being 
deployed among our personnel, U.S. personnel, so

12:47.563 --> 13:10.813
that we wouldn't raise hell with the European 
foresters like had occurred in World War I. With

13:13.550 --> 13:15.171
the 10th and 20th Engineers. And this brigadier 
had been involved in this whole thing in World War

13:15.452 --> 13:22.900
I, this English brigadier. And he was 
responsible, as I said, for trying to have some

13:23.500 --> 13:32.570
foresters set up as a unit within the U.S. forces to 
do exactly what I mentioned. And then we in this

13:33.691 --> 13:40.058
unit were splattered out among the armies on the 
continent, and I was assigned to Third Army.

13:48.262 --> 13:53.109
Oh, I wish I could remember that fellow's name who 
commanded the unit. Well, it's not important what

13:53.129 --> 13:55.212
his name was. But at any rate, he said, while we were 
with the military government, we all wore the

13:55.532 --> 14:06.488
unassigned insignia. You know what that is? He 
used to refer to it as a birdcage. But anyway,

14:12.288 --> 14:21.381
when Stan was his first name, maybe I'll think of 
his name before. Stan said, now let's get rid of

14:21.721 --> 14:24.325
these damn birdcages. Let's start to wear the 
engineer corps symbol. Okay, who was there to say

14:29.773 --> 14:31.876
that we couldn't? All of us trotted out to a supply 
store and... got Corps of Engineers insignia,

14:38.341 --> 14:43.568
which we probably started to wear after that. 
Fortunately, nobody challenged it. Well,

14:47.354 --> 15:04.438
eventually, because of the screwed-up 
situation, I managed to officially get

14:47.354 --> 15:04.438
transferred to the Third Army Corps of Engineers 
supply officer. And that's where I was. And in the

15:07.552 --> 15:14.619
meanwhile, while I was still attached to Itaza, I 
had authority to cross Army lines if I needed to.

15:15.160 --> 15:25.191
And our mission after I got to, was to keep the Paris 
office informed. That was where Itaza was

15:25.211 --> 15:28.334
situated at the time. On what the timber supply 
situation was in each of the armies and what was

15:28.954 --> 15:37.103
being done about it. Well, I could elaborate on 
that, but at any rate... That sounds like a

15:38.652 --> 15:43.098
horrendous job. Oh, it's... You could goof off 
100% of the time if you wanted to, you know. In other

15:50.529 --> 15:52.511
words, you could just guess at what it was. I 
certainly could. But I had a Jeep and a driver at my

15:54.915 --> 16:00.783
disposal. And I had the sort of travel orders where 
I could stop any place I wanted to. You weren't

16:07.152 --> 16:07.933
involved. When the Third Army moved across 
Europe, they moved rather fast. You weren't

16:12.082 --> 16:14.005
having to keep up with them? No, I was not with Third 
Army at that time. Oh, okay. I was just curious if

16:17.990 --> 16:22.175
you were attached to Third Army, if you were forced 
to constantly move the way they moved. No, no, no.

16:24.298 --> 16:31.568
This arrangement didn't take place until things 
had started to stabilize somewhat, that Third

16:24.298 --> 16:31.568
Army wasn't moving like it had. I remember, for 
example, I was with... I wasn't assigned to Third

16:36.044 --> 16:46.497
Army, but I was with Third Army at the time of the 
German breakthrough through the Ardennes. And I

16:46.557 --> 16:59.913
got word from the Paris office, Army 
headquarters, I don't mean Army, I mean ETASA

16:46.557 --> 16:59.913
headquarters, to come back to Paris and tell them 
what the score was. Hell, this was just, I had a

17:00.354 --> 17:03.958
little curiosity on, on the part of the fellow that 
headed up our particular unit. Where were you when

17:08.651 --> 17:11.753
the Ardennes breakout started? Do you remember? 
I'm trying to remember. I was in France somewhere.

17:14.716 --> 17:16.057
I don't exactly remember. I think it was in the area 
just west of Metz. Okay. Did you ever run across the

17:22.262 --> 17:24.244
26th Division? Any of those people? I'm just 
curious. My father was in the 26th Division with

17:26.646 --> 17:29.449
the Third Army. When the war ended, he was in 
Czechoslovakia. Oh, is that so? Yeah. Well, let's

17:34.094 --> 17:37.037
get back up to the Forest Service. There's a 
question I want to ask you about. Well, at any rate,

17:38.578 --> 17:41.460
I got back home, and I thought about it. I wrote to 
DW. I said, I heard that you have a vacancy in the

17:43.182 --> 17:49.848
position of the director of Texas Forest Service. 
I got a response from him. We arranged for

17:51.649 --> 18:04.000
interviews, and the sum and substance of it was 
that he and Chancellor Gale Christ and I met in

17:51.649 --> 18:04.000
Lufkin.

18:06.157 --> 18:10.423
This must have been in November, December 1948. 
And a kid wanted to get acquainted with me, I guess.

18:17.493 --> 18:23.622
And the upshot of it was I was offered the job, and I 
accepted, and I reported here January 1, 1949.

18:25.084 --> 18:25.545
Question. In some of these old papers that I found, 
it says during your interviews that you were also

18:26.005 --> 18:34.037
interviewed by a board from the Texas Forestry 
Association. I have no recollection. You don't

18:36.631 --> 18:38.373
remember meeting with any of those people? No. 
Because they were rather favorably impressed

18:40.136 --> 18:43.059
with you, according to this. Either that or 
Gilchrist is making it up as he goes along. I have no

18:47.364 --> 18:52.711
recollection of meeting anybody from the Texas 
Forestry Association. It may have happened. You

18:55.654 --> 18:57.797
may not have known who they were. Yeah, they may not 
have identified themselves, but a few years ago, a

18:57.997 --> 19:16.375
fellow by the name of Eck...

18:57.997 --> 19:16.375
Well, he was at that time a member of the board of the 
Texas Forestry Association. He's older than I am.

19:19.619 --> 19:25.945
Made the remark to me that he and he mentioned the 
other two men Went to Austin to recommend to the

19:27.123 --> 19:38.599
governor that I be designated as the director of 
the Texas Forest Service. I want to stop, just a

19:40.782 --> 19:41.923
moment.

19:45.328 --> 19:47.931
I don't . He's the one that told me about that. Gib 
Gilchrist wrote to . a guy by the name of Ruth, it's

19:56.165 --> 19:58.027
Peoples. Yeah. Who was on the board. Who was on the 
board, yeah. And it said, this morning we talked

20:00.830 --> 20:07.858
with a committee from the Texas Forestry 
Association, and they believe that Fowler's

20:00.830 --> 20:07.858
experience is just what we will need. And Gibb put 
out some letters to the members of the board, wrote

20:09.400 --> 20:12.424
glowing letters. Which board? The board of? Our 
board. Oh, the board of directors of A&M. Okay. And

20:19.492 --> 20:25.058
so the only thing I was curious about when all this 
was going on was that... Did you get any idea of what

20:25.595 --> 20:29.098
A&M was looking for when they hired you? Somewhere 
in here I read they had about 40 applicants. Forty?

20:34.183 --> 20:36.205
Yeah, that were sent. I've got a few letters 
saying, yeah, we'll file them with the rest. But

20:41.690 --> 20:44.713
there's something about you that's different. I 
don't think any other PhDs applied. No, because

20:48.076 --> 20:54.302
PhDs in the ministry were as scarce as hen's teeth 
at that time. did you get any impression from

20:54.687 --> 20:59.132
Gilchrist that this was a way to upgrade? They 
would be concerned with it now. I doubt if they

21:03.417 --> 21:04.498
would have. Well, I don't know that they would have 
then, but I was thinking if maybe Gilchrist is

21:04.518 --> 21:10.624
saying, here's a man with broad experience. He's 
got state experience. He's got private industry.

21:13.928 --> 21:14.909
He's got some federal work. He has the academic 
credentials. Well, I was also on the faculty for

21:17.852 --> 21:20.896
almost 10 years at LSU. Yeah, so he's got the 
academic credentials. Here's a man that is both

21:23.527 --> 21:27.230
industry and both academic. And they wouldn't 
have had anything. Now, people within the Forest

21:28.531 --> 21:31.614
Service applied for this job. And I got letters in 
here from Don Young and Ann . All these people had

21:34.877 --> 21:36.298
applied. But from looking over it, then there was 
no question. On paper, you had to be the best

21:40.561 --> 21:43.724
credential-wise. And I was just wondering if 
Forest Service, where they said, he's the best

21:43.744 --> 21:47.187
man. We want to upgrade the directorship of the 
program from what it was. We're going to get a

21:51.270 --> 21:53.112
high-powered individual in here. I just wondered 
if there was any feeling that you got that they were

21:54.053 --> 21:57.297
going to upgrade. Well, I was told by Kuntz over 
there at that meeting at Spring Hill when we were

21:57.578 --> 22:10.996
attending that I've heard they're willing to pay 
as much as $10,000 if they get the right man. Why?

22:15.061 --> 22:15.502
Oh, I don't know. I'm curious about that. Why 
suddenly do they care? I don't know. I don't see any

22:19.939 --> 22:22.363
evidence of caring in the past. No, you're so 
right. You're so right. Which reminds me that soon

22:24.667 --> 22:43.838
after I came here, I

22:24.667 --> 22:43.838
was somewhat conscious of public relations, and I 
arranged to set up an advisory committee of nine

22:24.667 --> 22:43.838
people to be appointed for two-year periods. 
eventually getting into an overlapping

22:44.611 --> 22:50.417
situation like they have on the board of directors 
here in the regions. Gibb wouldn't hear of two

22:51.539 --> 22:53.000
years. One year was all right. So he attended the 
first meeting. One of the men that I had persuaded

22:58.566 --> 23:09.218
to be a member represented the champion paper, and 
he was a pretty blunt sort of fellow. He said to Gib

23:10.008 --> 23:18.237
Gilchrist, why does the Texas Forest Service 
always have to suck in the hind tit of this A&M cow?

23:20.760 --> 23:24.464
And it was certainly true that they had done that. 
Do you remember who that was that said that? Oh, the

23:26.466 --> 23:27.307
name of Crow. Crow. C-R-O-W-R-O-W. I don't have an 
old list of that thing. I've got some of the later

23:35.236 --> 23:38.580
ones in the 50s, and I don't have his... I imagine if 
I look real hard, I can find it. What gave you the

23:41.884 --> 23:44.888
idea for setting up the advisory committee? Well, 
there, somehow I think I had picked up the idea that

23:44.908 --> 24:04.937
there wasn't any communication really between 
the industry that was a principal, had the

23:44.908 --> 24:04.937
principal interest in the Texas Forest Service 
because of controlled fire, and the

23:44.908 --> 24:04.937
organization. So I thought, well, there are less, 
more landowners interested in this, too, I would

24:09.205 --> 24:11.308
suppose. And I thought, well, this will be a means 
whereby they'll be willing to tell me,

24:11.348 --> 24:30.170
because there are several of them, what they 
think, what ways in which the Texas Forest Service

24:11.348 --> 24:30.170
could be improved. Was this a conscious public 
relations effort on your part, in a way? Yeah,

24:34.315 --> 24:36.057
yeah. It would work both ways. Here you are stuck in 
College Station. Not stuck, but the headquarters

24:39.641 --> 24:41.443
is here. And it's a way to get them over here and to 
talk about things? Or did you go to them? No. We had

24:46.509 --> 24:51.916
these meetings here in College Station in the 
director's office. So it was nice to get industry

24:52.497 --> 25:00.487
in one location, at least leaders of industry, 
rather than you making a circuit around.

25:02.850 --> 25:04.812
I suppose I could have gotten this same thing from 
the Texas Forestry Association. But the Texas

25:10.566 --> 25:16.454
Forestry Association at that time was something 
of a non-entity. And I didn't think well of it

25:17.475 --> 25:26.626
because while I was in Louisiana, another fellow 
and I were instrumental in creating the Louisiana

25:17.475 --> 25:26.626
Forestry Association. I'm surprised they didn't 
have one before then. Well, they had sort of a

25:30.611 --> 25:35.457
half-assed organization over there. It was led by 
a man by the name of Hartner from Urania, and he was

25:36.702 --> 25:47.372
something of a leader in forestry. He was one of the 
very, very few sawmillers who was trying to

25:47.392 --> 25:52.717
practice some semblance of forestry. Yes. In 
fact, he was, Goodrich Jones used to refer to him as

25:54.598 --> 26:06.169
the first, and got into a big argument with Lynch 
Davidson over Lynch Davidson claiming he had been

25:54.598 --> 26:06.169
over every inch of Urania land, and Goodrich wrote 
to Hartner. Hartner said, I've never seen a man on

26:09.627 --> 26:12.571
my land before he's lying. Okay. So one quick 
question about Louisiana. You ever heard of a man

26:19.561 --> 26:21.504
by the name of Forbes? R.D. Forbes. What did R.D. 
stand for, do you know? Reginald.

26:28.654 --> 26:30.517
Damn, I remember what his middle name is. That's 
good enough. Reginald Denny Forbes, I think.

26:34.314 --> 26:34.775
Reginald? R.D. Forbes. He was director of the 
Southern Forest Experiment Station. Okay,

26:38.719 --> 26:42.384
because he at one time was, of course, a state 
forester in Louisiana in the early years. One of

26:42.464 --> 26:43.184
their first. Very short time. And then he went on 
someplace else. But he was over in Texas helping

26:45.988 --> 26:50.833
out with Texas Forestry Association at one time. 
Oh, is that so? Oh, he came over to speak. They

26:52.495 --> 26:55.639
traded people back and forth, that sort of thing.

26:59.703 --> 27:00.304
When you... first took over the Texas Forest 
Service, what did you find? A demoralized

27:05.872 --> 27:12.140
organization. Why demoralized? Well, I don't 
think that White ever exerted much leadership. He

27:21.571 --> 27:24.774
succeeded Siki as state forester. And then Frost 
was acting. He was acting, and then Anderson was

27:26.356 --> 27:29.700
acting, and... Frankly, I don't know why Frost 
wasn't selected. But I think maybe some of the

27:34.702 --> 27:46.873
people in the industry felt that nobody from 
within the organization should be selected as

27:34.702 --> 27:46.873
director, because that would cause too much 
cleavage. Don Young had Kurth's backing

27:49.236 --> 27:53.860
initially, or at least the company had. Ernest 
Kurth? Well, through one of his minions. OK.

27:58.084 --> 28:00.126
Through the lumber company initially. Well, Don, 
you see, would have contact with, because his job

28:00.545 --> 28:09.256
in the Texas Forest Service was contacting 
industry. Yes, yes. So you found it demoralized,

28:12.480 --> 28:16.365
you feel, because of lack of leadership on White's 
part. Curious thing that I don't know is that

28:17.566 --> 28:25.236
during World War II, I don't know what the problems 
were in the industry or within the Forest Service,

28:17.566 --> 28:25.236
there was Pretty good expansion during World War 
II as far as buying equipment that they never had.

28:30.191 --> 28:32.635
They didn't have a mechanized tractor until 1941. 
They got them two-wheel tractors. They got five of

28:36.441 --> 28:37.302
them. And then they'd be able to, with those 
federal emergency funds, they purchased

28:38.063 --> 28:42.891
equipment and I guess got to keep it. Oh, yeah. And 
there was expansion. I'm sure there were some

28:48.099 --> 28:49.822
personnel problems. I'm sure there was a shortage 
of manpower during the war. Yes. But I didn't see

28:53.026 --> 28:56.370
anything within that part I looked at. It looked 
like nice growth, a few new programs, the war ends,

28:56.390 --> 29:01.837
and then it turned sour on him. Something had to 
have happened to White. I don't know what it was,

29:05.841 --> 29:13.391
whether this lack of leadership finally got him in 
a whole lot of trouble, that the thing fell apart on

29:05.841 --> 29:13.391
him. Well, one handicap that Bill had was that his 
wife would never come over here to live. He

29:19.158 --> 29:21.160
married... woman in Lufkin. You see, he was chief 
of the fire control section. His responsibility

29:29.849 --> 29:31.450
was fire. Had been since 1930. Well, I don't know 
how far back that went. Well, at any rate, then when

29:36.255 --> 29:47.164
he was selected for a job that was vacated by Siki,

29:36.255 --> 29:47.164
she wouldn't come over here and live with him. 
She'd visit occasionally.

29:51.464 --> 29:55.452
Bill was operating under something of a handicap, 
I'd say. Maybe that affected his general attitude

29:56.454 --> 30:01.664
toward the job. I have a sneaking suspicion he 
somehow got crossways with Gilchrist. Not, I

30:07.274 --> 30:08.697
still... We didn't have much time to because the 
system organization wasn't created until just

30:08.930 --> 30:17.402
about a year, year and a half before I came here. 
Gilchrist had been president and he'd been

30:17.422 --> 30:20.166
reporting to Gilchrist. Oh, I don't know. I guess 
so. I have a feeling that something happened in

30:23.191 --> 30:25.594
there. I think the event that caused the thing that 
everybody talks about is just a tip. Could be. This

30:32.885 --> 30:35.168
was like an excuse to get rid of somebody. Could be. 
Maybe Anderson has something on it. He'll have an

30:38.712 --> 30:39.913
opinion, I'm sure. But it just seemed to me that 
something went wrong between 1945 and 1948. Could

30:47.262 --> 30:47.682
be. Something really went wrong. So you found a 
demoralized agency. And the finances were in a

30:51.727 --> 30:54.009
shambles. Why? What damn if I know? They just 
weren't, huh? They were in a shambles because Bill

30:58.094 --> 31:03.199
White didn't concern himself any. There was no 
financial control at all? Hardly any. That was one

31:07.098 --> 31:09.020
of the first things I did. Can you tell me anything 
about financial control, just in a nutshell? I'm

31:15.226 --> 31:16.487
not sure I understand your question. About what it 
is that you did to establish financial control.

31:19.750 --> 31:22.553
Oh, well, first of all, I created a budget. He never 
had a budget before? Not that I know of. Oh, there

31:25.536 --> 31:27.198
was a semblance of one. He had to have something to 
present to the U.S. Forest Service. Yeah, the

31:31.282 --> 31:34.985
Clark McNary reports had something of it, but it 
was more of an after-the-fact. Yeah. And the state

31:35.903 --> 31:39.907
budget was broken down broadly. Very broadly. 
What kind of a budget did you prepare? Was it a, what

31:45.333 --> 31:48.196
are the terms they use now? I'm not an accountant. 
There are several types of budgets. Well, I

31:52.140 --> 31:58.286
created an overall budget for the agency, broken 
down by departments and by districts. Also, I

31:58.767 --> 32:04.152
created an organization in the field which really 
hadn't existed. What's that? Well, I created six

32:05.671 --> 32:09.395
districts, administrative districts. Up until 
that time, there had been no real field activity

32:11.457 --> 32:20.826
other than fire control, and fire control 
operated out of Joe Burnside's desk over in

32:11.457 --> 32:20.826
Lufkin. Just out of his desk? Yeah. Now, the six 
districts then, did they not have anything, if

32:23.509 --> 32:33.619
this straightens my mind, they weren't then 
necessarily controlled with fire control? No.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.029
That was a major function. So the only 
organization really in East Texas up until you

32:37.049 --> 32:42.215
came was the fire control organization. Right. A 
highly decentralized organization. Did you not

32:45.840 --> 32:48.142
reduce the number of divisions also? Weren't 
there five when you came and you reorganized it

32:48.523 --> 32:52.147
down to four? Four. Do you recall why? Or just made 
it streamlined or more efficient? I don't know

32:58.234 --> 32:59.216
why. I wasn't conscious of the fact that there were 
five. Well, I set it up. I guess, yes.

33:12.957 --> 33:17.101
Well, I would have to scratch my head more than I can 
right now. But I don't remember what the five might

33:17.441 --> 33:23.027
have been, but we had four. One was forest 
products, fire control, management, and I&E.

33:33.168 --> 33:36.373
They don't break it down in some of these older 
reports as to what they were. They would say,

33:36.794 --> 33:41.321
forest management, industrial forestry. Well, 
excuse me, that industrial forestry was

33:42.062 --> 33:50.094
contained in one person, Coons, at this point. 
Well, later on by Don Young. Yeah. Civil cultural

33:54.501 --> 33:59.549
research, forest products research, and then 
they had it broken down by the nursery. Then they

34:00.050 --> 34:01.572
just called it information. Well, I'll tell you, 
the fifth one was research. Okay. I eliminated

34:07.180 --> 34:09.983
that. And put it under what? Well, I eliminated 
research as a function. You didn't do any more

34:18.291 --> 34:21.214
research at that point? No. No, my position was 
that with a very, very limited budget that we had,

34:21.354 --> 34:26.499
we had no damn business doing research. Well, good 
question, because what I did was, in looking

34:26.519 --> 34:30.023
through the war years, They didn't do a whole lot of 
research until World War II, and then they just

34:30.560 --> 34:38.571
kind of played with it, and it looked to me as if they 
were redoing research that was being done by the

34:30.560 --> 34:38.571
federal people already. Oh, they were messing 
around with it. Dave Anderson was messing around

34:40.414 --> 34:43.077
with it. Okay. They were making plastics out of 
pecan holes. Well, now that was done over at the

34:45.681 --> 34:48.585
Forest Products Laboratory. Yeah. Now, you 
didn't close that, did you? No, no. But you moved

34:51.269 --> 34:53.091
them under someone else? No, that was a... 
Separate situation now. No. Essentially, what

34:56.756 --> 34:58.879
the Forest Products... Department, and it's 
called LAB now. Well, essentially what they did

35:02.191 --> 35:08.881
over there was conducted investigative 
projects. Well, I guess you could, if you use the

35:09.763 --> 35:16.232
word research very broadly, you could say, yes, 
they did forest products research. I see. Okay.

35:19.377 --> 35:28.410
Well, you can see the limitations in my 
understanding, and looking at it from the

35:19.377 --> 35:28.410
outside, I get this back and forth.

35:29.133 --> 35:34.658
Okay, well, what you did, in effect, was really 
just kind of streamline the whole thing, get rid of

35:29.133 --> 35:34.658
unnecessary elements. You felt research was... 
Well, there was a lack of cohesion in the whole

35:34.718 --> 35:41.023
effort. Who was doing the... Now, this research, 
where was it being carried on? Here? No. No, which

35:46.047 --> 35:47.048
research? Well, you were talking about... There 
are two types of research. The one that you're

35:48.750 --> 35:49.630
getting... I'd like to know about the one that you 
wanted to get rid of. Civil cultural research.

35:53.213 --> 35:54.294
Civil cultural research. That was... Dave 
Anderson headed that up here, and he had... a

35:59.255 --> 36:03.520
subordinate over at Kirbyville by the name of Ted 
Silker. Okay. Ted did all the work and Andy did the

36:05.142 --> 36:07.564
supervising. From here? Yeah. It's kind of long 
distance. Oh, sure. Okay.

36:15.613 --> 36:19.878
And White condoned all of this long distance kind 
of operation? Oh, sure. Or did he just not care? I

36:22.401 --> 36:23.422
don't think he cared. He wasn't interested in 
research. Well, he didn't have enough budget to be

36:28.482 --> 36:29.503
Not having any. He didn't have enough budget to 
have fat in it. In such a tiny little budget. I don't

36:34.589 --> 36:35.490
know what it was. Well, it wasn't much. It was damn 
small, I know, when I came here. It's not real large

36:40.336 --> 36:42.799
now compared to other things. Well, it's 
amazingly large considering what the job is.

36:46.944 --> 36:47.044
Okay.

36:49.988 --> 36:53.592
So, in a way, now you've made the Forest Service 
more efficient. Now, demoralized problems,

36:57.018 --> 36:59.862
That's a morale problem within the, what'd you do 
about that? Or could you do it? Well, there wasn't

37:00.963 --> 37:02.626
much I could do about it. Yeah. But, see, here was 
Joe Burnside. He wanted to be director, too. I

37:10.336 --> 37:15.463
don't know how hard he tried, but he would have 
liked to have been director. I think everybody

37:15.924 --> 37:17.426
would have. As a matter of fact, this is kind of 
small of me to mention, but I will anyway. Not long

37:25.197 --> 37:26.839
after I got here, and I was trying to organize a 
budget. I was talking to Joe Burnside over there in

37:30.343 --> 37:44.323
his office, and he showed me a budget that he had 
prepared for the Texas Forest Service, and he had

37:30.343 --> 37:44.323
shown how much my salary should be.

37:48.209 --> 37:53.576
That illustrates the lack of finesse that Joe had. 
Joe, in some respects, was... He was a pretty good

37:56.536 --> 37:59.079
organizer. He was overburdened, though, with 
formalities and forms. He was over-organized

38:08.992 --> 38:12.056
considering what he had to work with. He was pretty 
much desk-bound, too. But morale was really not

38:16.381 --> 38:22.349
much you could do other than— See, I inherited 
these fellows. Oh, yeah. Now, anybody that comes

38:23.350 --> 38:26.374
in is going to inherit a lot of problems. Did you get 
rid of any people? No, I didn't. Finally, I made

38:30.471 --> 38:39.843
things uncomfortable enough where Gene, a fellow 
over at the Forest Products Department, had left

38:30.471 --> 38:39.843
him. So he left. So you only had a minor shakeup in 
personnel over a period of time. Yeah. Did you

38:45.790 --> 38:47.212
bring in any of your own people? No, I had nobody to 
bring in. There was nobody that you... Many times

38:50.276 --> 38:53.340
administrators coming in want to bring in some of 
their people. No, in my case, there wasn't anybody

38:54.029 --> 38:57.012
I wanted to bring in with me. Okay. Well, then you 
decided to up your PR standards by creating the

38:59.934 --> 39:07.662
advisory committee. Of course, this may have been 
a help also to morale. If industry took an interest

39:09.664 --> 39:19.893
in you, maybe that would have been expressed back 
through the field, and if your people felt like

39:09.664 --> 39:19.893
industry was interested, that might have helped. 
It might have a double effect. It might have. I'm

39:23.462 --> 39:25.986
not sure, though, about that. One, the people that 
were in before you left, both Anderson and

39:27.007 --> 39:34.279
Frost... Before I left? I mean, before you came, I 
get the impression they were just caretakers.

39:38.866 --> 39:39.888
Essentially, yeah. They couldn't make any real 
decisions. Once I asked D.W. Williams, well, I

39:41.750 --> 39:49.062
guess I should have been a little more subtle than I 
was, but... I'm the sort of fellow that's not as

39:49.548 --> 39:52.151
subtle as I should be. I'm a little blunt. I said to 
DW, why didn't you people make Anderson director?

40:00.959 --> 40:04.343
DW, he's a pretty subtle sort of fellow. I said, oh, 
we didn't think he was quite ready for it. And that

40:08.326 --> 40:09.347
was the end of that.

40:14.793 --> 40:14.893
Yeah. I just wondered. It's funny that they 
brought, of course, they brought you in. Frost, I

40:20.809 --> 40:25.556
mean, White was the first one ever hired who had 
been brought up through the ranks. They'd all come

40:26.197 --> 40:27.959
in from the outside before. But he didn't have many 
ranks to draw on. No, that's true. And, you know,

40:32.385 --> 40:38.673
today, it's funny that they've now done it twice 
with both Kramer and Bruce Miles. Yeah. Well, now,

40:39.835 --> 40:44.901
there's a pretty fair organization from which to 
draw on now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, considerably.

40:46.754 --> 40:49.497
everything being relative, it is huge compared to 
what it was. Yeah.

40:54.322 --> 40:58.447
Well, was there anything else that you noticed 
that you could do anything about when you first

40:54.322 --> 40:58.447
came in? Well, that's— It sounds like an abysmal 
problem in a way that you've got an— No, no, really I

40:59.167 --> 41:07.336
enjoyed the first few years of reorganization. I 
instituted financial control. There hadn't been

41:12.361 --> 41:15.765
any control before by the budgetary process. The 
service had a budget. Every department had a

41:18.751 --> 41:20.593
budget. Every district had a budget. Previously, 
they were just spending money, sending in the

41:22.895 --> 41:25.899
receipt for it. It goes on the book, and when they 
ran out, they ran out. Well, essentially, that's

41:28.141 --> 41:30.143
what it was. It wasn't quite that bad, but not a 
whole lot better. Okay. Okay. All right. You can't

41:38.853 --> 41:41.496
really do anything unless you have budgetary 
control. No, that's exactly right. You can't,

41:42.560 --> 41:44.803
because you'll just wind up in the middle of the 
year. And I'm naturally inclined that way, and I

41:44.823 --> 41:49.871
had had pretty good experience with IP in this. IP? 
International Paper. Okay.

41:56.420 --> 42:06.074
If you were writing about your tenure in the Forest 
Service, what points would you want to include? If

42:06.575 --> 42:12.263
you were writing about it, think about important 
things done, something of significance, what

42:06.575 --> 42:12.263
would you include? Well,

42:12.445 --> 42:23.758
I'd say I modernized fire control because of 
getting larger appropriations. That was a crying

42:24.178 --> 42:25.680
need. That's the most important thing they 
needed. Particularly communications, for

42:27.462 --> 42:29.684
example. There were hundreds of miles of grounded 
telephone line that were used for communications

42:29.724 --> 42:42.098
from tower to tower and tower to offices and so on. I 
eliminated all that and replaced it. I shouldn't

42:44.786 --> 42:47.569
say I, but we eliminated that. But you directed. 
And converted it to radio. That was the first big

42:50.072 --> 42:53.296
step. There was some radio previous to your... 
Damn little. And I'm wondering if some of it was

42:58.683 --> 43:01.927
even gone by the time you got there. There was a good 
bit during the war. There was a remnant of it up in

43:04.850 --> 43:10.037
Linden, but that was about all. There were five... 
base radio stations during the Second World War

43:11.525 --> 43:17.692
that they had going, mostly with used Philco 
equipment. And they even got radios into their

43:18.333 --> 43:20.875
Jeeps. But I have a feeling all this Army stuff 
finally broke down and they were unable to replace

43:21.136 --> 43:25.581
it. Could be. I think it was Comshaw from the Army. 
But okay, that's an important point. It's

43:31.828 --> 43:40.958
something I don't pick up by reading annual 
reports, that the equipment breaks down and if you

43:31.828 --> 43:40.958
can't replace it, it's like you never had it 
almost. What else can you recall in your tenure?

43:43.860 --> 43:55.434
Well, then eventually we got away from the use of 
lookout towers for detection. We went to

43:55.514 --> 44:03.845
aircraft, partly on a supplemental basis, and 
then finally on a total basis. When you arrived as

44:04.425 --> 44:09.191
director, do you remember how many aircraft they 
owned? Oh, they were piddling around. They

44:10.533 --> 44:11.434
owned... two or three small planes. The Swifts? 
Yeah. Okay. Well, one was a Moody II, I think. Okay.

44:23.773 --> 44:26.758
Then where did you try to push your air 
observation? Through your own Air Force? No, I

44:28.500 --> 44:34.189
decided the hell with trying to maintain these 
planes. We are going to rent them. From whom then

44:36.572 --> 44:37.894
did What kind of companies? Did you rent pilots? Do 
you have your own pilots? No, we rented planes

44:42.284 --> 44:58.949
complete with pilots, and we trained the pilots in 
how to identify, how to communicate with the

44:42.284 --> 44:58.949
district office as to where the fire was situated. 
Now, in this connection, too, we didn't have any

44:59.310 --> 45:02.214
maps. So we went in the map-making business. yours 
was about the fourth effort at the map-making

45:08.435 --> 45:11.500
basis. Oh? CCC tried. They were unreliable. Oh, of 
course. For fire control purposes. It seems like

45:18.170 --> 45:23.077
every director since Foster has been trying to 
make maps of Texas. They do a pretty good job now. At

45:24.158 --> 45:25.080
least they're nice looking. Well, oh yeah, 
there's a big improvement over what was there.

45:31.790 --> 45:34.594
Well, we... did go into the map-making business 
because we used as base maps the mapping that had

45:35.148 --> 45:56.771
been done in connection with

45:35.148 --> 45:56.771
soil, with allotments for crops. Triple A? Triple 
A. We started with them as a base. These were soil

46:02.975 --> 46:05.238
conservation maps that they started with? I don't 
know where they... Soil conservation maps were

46:06.700 --> 46:12.227
made up from these AAA maps, I think. So you had a 
mapping problem. Did you ever complete the

46:15.592 --> 46:16.933
problem? Yeah, yeah. We knew that this is 
something that had gone continuously because of

46:19.657 --> 46:25.865
the modifications of the landscape. Time out just 
a moment.
