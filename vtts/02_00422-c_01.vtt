WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:08.248
Mule up in the mountains where there's artillery, 
mortar fire, and small arms fire. If a shell hits

00:08.268 --> 00:15.495
nearby, a horse will jump over the side of the 
mountain. Just anyway. Because it's startled and

00:16.937 --> 00:20.600
scared and out of control. A mule will actually 
react like a human being. It'll go down. You know,

00:26.466 --> 00:27.306
scrunch down. Another thing about a mule, After 
you've delivered your load up on the mountain, you

00:30.473 --> 00:42.266
just take the line, tie it up on the pack saddle, 
slap it on the rear, and it'll go back to where it was

00:30.473 --> 00:42.266
fed the night before. You do that to a horse, he may 
go towards the enemy line.

00:47.992 --> 00:52.477
Some horses might go back, but most of them, you 
have to lead them up and lead them back. Mules are

00:52.957 --> 00:55.921
soon found to be the most dependent. And so, 
because C-rations can, they're bad enough, but at

00:55.941 --> 01:00.025
least they're... Because we only had three 
different menus. They were heavier. So that's the

01:06.876 --> 01:08.418
reason why they got those little cans. They never 
got any hot meals. Not while we were up on the

01:10.681 --> 01:13.184
mountain. When we got down. Because they had those 
big, what you call them, marmite cans. And even one

01:20.294 --> 01:24.679
man had a different kind of those things. But 
water. But you're not very hungry anyway. But I say

01:28.184 --> 01:29.505
living like that. Yeah. cold and wet, just 
miserable. And you were eager to get out of it.

01:36.771 --> 01:42.839
Yeah, of course, France and Germany, you've got 
houses and basements.

01:42.859 --> 01:50.110
Not only that, but then you're conducting combat 
or war as you have been trained the way it should be.

01:50.130 --> 01:51.572
Sure, and not up on Devil Amon. That's right. And 
you make a reconnaissance, you plan your

01:53.174 --> 02:01.045
artillery, your mortar, your maneuver, and then 
you go off And you take prisoners. You don't suffer

02:02.714 --> 02:04.096
so many casualties. And those that you do, you can 
immediately evacuate them, even without

02:04.116 --> 02:08.122
helicopters. Now, what was your role in the 
invasion of southern France? I was battalion

02:12.428 --> 02:18.035
commander then, major in the battalion command. I 
got promoted or given a battalion after that Monte

02:18.055 --> 02:26.307
Cassino battle up on top of the mountain. See, once 
again, I've been fortunate. I survived. I get

02:31.129 --> 02:34.313
wounded later on in France, but it's a minor wound. 
But there weren't many around me that started out

02:34.334 --> 02:42.305
when we went into southern France. That started 
out when you were in Italy? Yeah. Because they'd

02:46.972 --> 02:49.215
either been wounded or killed. And were you in the 
first assault? Or would you explain? In southern

02:57.893 --> 02:58.814
France. Southern France invasion. Yeah, but 
that... Salerno, I say it was a fight. Yeah. But we

03:07.504 --> 03:09.206
got in there. Once again, fortunate. We went in in 
the assault in the beach. And where we went in,

03:16.935 --> 03:23.903
there wasn't any resistance, except, of course, 
they had barriers all in the water. But it was a

03:24.284 --> 03:26.466
beautiful beach, and it was quiet. Because the 
Germans were down lower, protecting an airfield.

03:34.338 --> 03:38.742
So we went in with no artillery preparation or 
anything like that. Because the French are living

03:40.324 --> 03:42.826
all around. And it's a good thing we didn't. So we 
were able to get in. And there was no fighting. The

03:49.813 --> 03:53.977
fighting came later on, because the Germans' 
defensive plan was to counterattack. Of course,

03:54.057 --> 03:57.060
that was their plan. an invasion of a channel. They 
must have had a screen out front, and they would

04:00.592 --> 04:05.700
have countered that. Well, here, they didn't even 
have a screen where we were. So where we hit was an

04:08.504 --> 04:12.189
unopposed invasion. Where others hit was a pretty 
good fire. But later on, they put an airstrike on us

04:15.694 --> 04:25.528
and hit two or three of the boats, including an 
ammunition boat, where it's at the main. But we

04:26.926 --> 04:30.350
were welcome there in France, at best. And as soon 
as you got ashore, what'd you do? Move inland. You

04:35.838 --> 04:37.760
just moved inland as fast as possible? Yeah. Went 
on, cleared the beach. Then they unloaded all of

04:41.124 --> 04:46.071
our equipment, vehicles, according to the plan. 
Then they went ahead and rendezvoused us up. And

04:49.395 --> 04:50.517
then we moved around. And were any of the French 
right down on the beach? No. We surprised

04:55.225 --> 04:56.807
everybody. People were asleep because it was 
early in the morning. We went all around. We got our

05:05.117 --> 05:16.711
vehicles, wheels, all around and got in one of the 
toughest battles that we had in France or later on

05:05.117 --> 05:16.711
in Germany.

05:20.035 --> 05:21.857
And this was written up. It was up in the Rhone 
Valley. Oh, that one. This was written up by Wick

05:25.285 --> 05:33.414
Fowler and two or three others about this. You see, 
in addition to us landing in southern France, the

05:33.434 --> 05:37.859
3rd Division landed. So we were able, and this, 
once again, was pretty well planned, not by me, but

05:37.879 --> 05:52.435
to hire up, where we landed there on this narrow 
beach, unopposed, went on around and got around

05:37.879 --> 05:52.435
and got on the high ground of the Rhone Valley, and 
the 3rd Division was pushing the Germans. They had

05:53.140 --> 05:56.484
a lot of force in southern France, a lot of tanks. 
And so they were having a pretty good battle. So we

05:59.247 --> 06:04.273
tried to block to the north.

06:08.257 --> 06:12.362
Monte Lemire, I think is the name of that place. And 
that was my battalion. We were on the high ground.

06:16.026 --> 06:20.751
The road goes, the main road's here, and then 
there's another parallel road. And it's

06:21.355 --> 06:23.598
mountains up here, mountains over there. And we 
were in a small mountain high in the middle. In

06:27.985 --> 06:31.550
between the two roads, a road on each side, and you 
were sort of on a hill. Yeah, so here come the

06:31.570 --> 06:33.693
Germans, see. Down the road? They're coming all 
over the place. They're retreating, but not

06:37.559 --> 06:41.485
running, see. The tank was a whole lot. Just 
walking by a strategic retreat? Yeah. But one of

06:45.551 --> 06:49.236
the problems they had, they could go no faster than 
that. They had a lot of horse drones. artillery

06:51.494 --> 06:54.759
equipment. I guess they put them down in southern 
France rather than elsewhere because they

06:54.779 --> 07:03.791
thought it would be relatively safe and could use 
them, particularly to put the guns in position.

07:04.953 --> 07:05.814
But they were retreating. Fortunately, we were 
dug in on top of them. We relieved another unit, so

07:12.203 --> 07:17.711
they had some holes dug, so that gave us an 
advantage just to improve the holes that were

07:12.203 --> 07:17.711
already there. And I put my CP in a Fortunately, not 
in the house, a real nice house, but in a potato bin

07:22.392 --> 07:31.222
that was L-shaped. So you're going this way and 
this way. So even shell fires can't get in this back

07:33.284 --> 07:38.129
part here. So it all started. And they were 
attacking. And knowing that we were in holes, and I

07:41.853 --> 07:50.543
wasn't in the potato bin at the time,

07:51.586 --> 07:57.032
I called for artillery down in our own position 
because the Germans were all over the place. Just

07:57.913 --> 08:05.002
horseback, tanks, trucks, and just, boy, just a 
nightmare. Just like one of these Fourth of July

08:05.522 --> 08:12.731
type of fireworks, you know, except this was on the 
ground, right? That's the only communication I

08:14.393 --> 08:17.236
had with our artillery liaison.

08:19.659 --> 08:21.441
So could you get some gunfire support? Yeah, they 
did. So we got our tour, brought it down to our own

08:23.145 --> 08:26.469
position. And, you know, I used to hear horses. You 
know, when they'd get hit, we'd hear others

08:31.134 --> 08:34.218
turning over. And

08:34.258 --> 08:43.650
I was there at the entrance there trying to watch 
and see what was going on, trying to keep some kind

08:34.258 --> 08:43.650
of control. Because we had communication with our 
own people. At least initially we had telephone

08:46.974 --> 08:49.477
and also radio. We were company commanders. My 
exec was down in the low ground where our roadblock

08:51.880 --> 09:01.532
was, which didn't last long because the Germans 
soon knocked that out, overran it. I mean, they're

09:01.573 --> 09:04.216
frantic, man. So I'm out in front, and I usually 
tell anybody about my wound. I had a hero's wound.

09:12.427 --> 09:16.031
That means I got hit in the back during all of this 
sort. And I didn't even realize it at the time. A

09:19.538 --> 09:21.000
lieutenant was there. Were you in the command post 
at this time? Well, out in the front. Oh, okay, out

09:24.304 --> 09:26.988
in front. Trying to direct your soldiers? Trying 
to keep some kind of control, seeing what was going

09:29.391 --> 09:32.555
on. So the lieutenant who was there, he was 
controlling his mortar, our heavy weapons

09:35.139 --> 09:42.689
company, the 81mm mortars. He was there. And he got 
hit with a fragment because the Germans... were

09:49.762 --> 09:54.227
then, they were fighting us trying to get them in 
all this.

09:57.451 --> 10:01.415
And just a small fragment, all at once he keeled 
over, like we didn't know what happened to him. We

10:01.435 --> 10:04.439
just thought he had fallen over. And finally, we 
lifted the artillery and it was all quiet. All you

10:09.364 --> 10:13.549
could hear was some of those horses moaning and 
groaning and went out. And we had Germans

10:13.749 --> 10:16.012
scattered all over the place. Well, what, torn all 
up, torn over? Horses with their belly, bowels

10:19.462 --> 10:21.844
hanging out.

10:24.827 --> 10:29.031
So the unit got a presidential citation for that 
particular action. In my room, I say I didn't even

10:30.112 --> 10:35.677
know it because I had a pistol belt and then the web 
belt on my thing. And he went through in the back,

10:35.697 --> 10:41.121
through the pistol belt, through the web belt, and 
just penetrated. You were lucky. Enough to where

10:42.463 --> 10:43.544
it was bleeding. But I didn't even know that until 
they said, you better go have that looked at

10:44.144 --> 10:48.388
because I'm There's quite a bit of blood coming. 
And I went to the aid station over there. You were

10:52.888 --> 10:54.511
really lucky to get that belt on. Small fragments, 
you know. And we had very few casualties. I really

11:02.324 --> 11:06.891
thought, this is going to be so sickening because I 
know what I've done. I've killed all of my own

11:06.971 --> 11:10.858
people, you know, trying to hold this position 
here. But it turned out very few casualties. And I

11:13.923 --> 11:15.405
don't think we had any dead. They just got down in 
their foxholes and let the gunfire support do the

11:15.773 --> 11:19.538
job? Yeah. So basically it was the artillery that 
won the battle? Yeah. That's what I would say,

11:26.788 --> 11:32.195
because we were in no position to do anything 
except to stay put.

11:37.242 --> 11:38.423
And we took a lot of prisoners. A lot of wounded 
prisoners. We had troops on the high ground up, so

11:41.147 --> 11:45.072
they were trying to get out of there, I said. 
including a general. In fact, I had his pistol. I

11:49.318 --> 12:03.000
don't have it anymore because I gave it to a 
youngster when we were stationed up in

11:49.318 --> 12:03.000
Washington.

12:03.020 --> 12:06.466
Of course, the Germans got through some of them. 
But he was the general in command? Yeah. And you

12:09.030 --> 12:09.831
captured him? Yeah. Was he a one-star general or a 
two-star? Two-star general. I think he's

12:14.723 --> 12:16.765
equivalent of our division commander.

12:19.487 --> 12:23.151
I'm kidding.

12:23.511 --> 12:26.394
He was surprised how few troops we had. Did he speak 
English? Yeah. You can't really tell artillery

12:29.296 --> 12:34.861
sometimes which way it's coming when it's hit. Of 
course, you can hear the bump over there, but when

12:34.881 --> 12:40.827
you're hearing just all this going at the same 
time, you can't hear the bump in the distance. It's

12:41.465 --> 12:54.223
only by the splash can you tell which direction 
it's coming from.

12:54.243 --> 12:57.829
Was that about the only major confrontation that 
you had? Because the southern invasion went

12:57.849 --> 13:08.464
rather quickly. Well, yeah. Of course, this is 
where the This was the first contact we had in

13:12.616 --> 13:18.021
southern France, but this is moving on. But later 
on we had a lot more, especially around the Rhine

13:18.541 --> 13:24.206
Valley. And were you at this time under, were you 
put under the Third Army with that? No, we were

13:33.915 --> 13:41.121
under, when we left Clark's Fifth Army, we were 
under Seventh Army. in southern France, and then

13:42.502 --> 13:49.268
we were part of the French First Army for a while. No 
kidding. Part of the French First Free Forces?

13:53.052 --> 13:54.093
Yeah. And who was in charge of that, Leclerc? I 
think so. I never did. See, I'm only a battalion

13:59.678 --> 14:01.320
commander. Sure, but how'd you get along? Did you 
work right in unison with the French troops? Well,

14:06.004 --> 14:09.808
we had French troops on our flank next to us. How was 
the cooperation between the free French and the

14:10.548 --> 14:15.874
Americans? Okay, but we didn't find as many French 
as speak English. We found Germans and it seemed

14:18.517 --> 14:24.023
like they were the average German spoke. They were 
just higher ranking. No, I had a very unfortunate

14:27.046 --> 14:30.550
situation working with the French. Oh, is that? It 
was unfortunate for the French.

14:36.137 --> 14:37.398
Well, I'll skip all of the action. We had a lot of it. 
We went into... Well,

14:40.433 --> 14:49.789
I might tell you another one that involves the 
442nd Combat Team. You remember the

14:49.809 --> 14:51.312
Japanese-Americans? Yeah. In fact, last year we 
had a reunion. I didn't attend it. It was the 442nd

14:56.501 --> 15:00.769
with the 36th Division in Dallas. And they hauled 
in all sorts of flowers and fruit, you know, for the

15:00.789 --> 15:05.597
occasion. But you know that part of these 442nd 
people came from these relocation camps.

15:11.200 --> 15:11.721
Absolutely. And left their mothers and fathers 
and sisters there. And then, of course, they came

15:16.006 --> 15:20.190
from Hawaii also. They were attached to the 36th 
after we had gone up out of the Rhone Valley around

15:20.210 --> 15:27.058
three years. And my battalion was in reserve. And 
General Dahlquist,

15:34.231 --> 15:43.424
the commanding general, called for me. He says, I 
know you've just been out of the line. It's time for

15:46.488 --> 15:48.210
your battalion to rest. But he said, we've got a 
problem. We've got a lost battalion. A battalion

15:53.738 --> 15:57.463
of 141st had advanced and got cut off. And he says, I 
want you to take your battalion been attacked to

16:03.847 --> 16:07.494
get to them so we can get them out of there. So of 
course I said, yes sir, and I went to get the

16:10.038 --> 16:15.468
battalion alerted and moving. And fortunately 
for me, this is another one of these lucky breaks,

16:15.488 --> 16:22.260
fate or whatever. By the time I got back to the 
battalion, of course they alerted them, they were

16:22.280 --> 16:26.648
all getting ready to move out. I get a telephone 
call that says, just disregard the orders. We've

16:31.874 --> 16:35.859
decided it's too big a job for battalions. It's 
going to take at least a regiment. So we're going to

16:37.762 --> 16:41.407
use a full 42nd combat team, which they did. And 
they fought for several days. They took

16:44.250 --> 16:45.812
tremendous casualties. And they got to them and 
got them out at a very high price. My battalion

16:52.902 --> 16:55.285
would never have been able to do what I've done. got 
decimated and still had to have somebody to help

16:55.484 --> 17:00.771
him. Did you meet any of these Japanese American 
troops? I did then. I don't remember now. I don't

17:08.120 --> 17:11.164
remember, for example, what's his name? How'd 
they impress you? The one who's got the arm of, you

17:12.525 --> 17:16.951
know, a member of Congress. Oh, for me. Super. Of 
course, they had a Not only they, just like all

17:26.213 --> 17:35.487
Japanese, tremendous fighters and courageous, 
but they had a point to prove. That they were just as

17:37.590 --> 17:45.341
patriotic, or better, more patriotic and better 
fighters than the non-Japanese. Never

17:47.084 --> 17:50.128
complained.

17:51.965 --> 17:55.710
But that was terrible that they hadn't had such a 
licking because, see, you didn't have

17:51.965 --> 17:55.710
replacements. You know, when they took ahead a 
casualty list, they didn't readily have

17:55.730 --> 18:02.058
replacements. It takes a long time. So they used up 
their capability, their present capability, in

18:05.202 --> 18:12.891
just a few days. But while they're getting ready to 
preach, I haven't performed with them. We're

18:15.675 --> 18:19.339
still part of the 1st Preach Army, the 36th. We went 
to... into the Rhone Valley, just below

18:22.222 --> 18:27.488
Strasbourg. And the Germans had counterattacked 
it earlier, and they had a riverhead north and one

18:27.508 --> 18:40.562
south of Strasbourg. So the mission of my 
battalion was to eliminate

18:42.044 --> 18:51.334
that element of Germans south of Strasbourg. And 
then we'd been fighting longer than any other day.

18:56.643 --> 19:04.832
I think we'd been in contact with enemy a hundred 
and something days, ever since southern France.

19:07.334 --> 19:14.282
And we were still in good shape, though, because 
they hadn't had cagers, fortunately, since the

19:07.334 --> 19:14.282
442nd took our cagers.

19:18.346 --> 19:20.589
So they said, well, we don't have any tanks. They 
said, we'll attach a platoon of French tanks. So

19:27.632 --> 19:31.338
here they came around just before we attacked 
them. They didn't speak English. Nobody spoke

19:34.843 --> 19:47.822
French until I thought, gee, my striker or aide, 
he's from Louisiana, he speaks French. Well, he

19:47.842 --> 19:49.925
spoke Cajun French, you know. So he came up and He 
says they understood him, but I'm not sure they

19:54.190 --> 19:56.634
did. So we planned an attack, see. We were going to 
attack with two companies here. And I was going to

20:03.824 --> 20:07.109
send another company around here. And I told those 
tanks, do not, the commander there, do not go into

20:07.429 --> 20:21.109
this village until my infantry is there so they can 
go with you, support you. And Geetri, that's his

20:22.675 --> 20:24.217
name. This is probably his son who pitches for 
them, a grandson who pitches for the New York

20:24.718 --> 20:30.565
Yankees. Same, of course, Geetri's like Smith. So 
Geetri, I said, are you sure they understand that?

20:39.315 --> 20:40.257
He said, well, I'll repeat it. And he went through 
the same thing. Give this company time to get there

20:42.720 --> 20:48.707
before you go into the village. They all 
understood it. So, okay, we had it all set at the

20:50.587 --> 20:54.050
time, and we got ready to go. Had an artillery 
preparation, and attacked. What did those French

20:59.576 --> 21:01.138
tanks do? They went right around there by 
themselves and went right on into the village, and

21:01.158 --> 21:07.304
all four of them got knocked out with bazookas, 
Germans. The Germans called them Panzerfaust,

21:07.864 --> 21:10.046
not bazookas. All four tanks. Why do you think they 
did that? They didn't understand, I guess.

21:20.894 --> 21:26.663
Or maybe they thought they could take the village 
by themselves, but we knew the Germans then,

21:20.894 --> 21:26.663
because those Panzerfausts, boy, they had 
deadly. You know, you got somebody in an upstair

21:27.204 --> 21:41.587
window, you point that thing down there, anywhere 
on top of a tank, vulnerable, especially over the

21:27.204 --> 21:41.587
engine.

21:41.607 --> 21:45.113
Then we got in the village, and we didn't take the 
village. What village was that? Do you remember? I

21:46.892 --> 21:47.372
don't remember. I had to look at the map. I thought 
about this.

21:53.122 --> 21:58.871
Then I got orders about 10 o'clock at night. Since 
we hadn't cleared the village by that time, pull

21:58.891 --> 22:06.203
out, because we were going out of the line. We 
really didn't go out of the line. We went to a less

22:08.567 --> 22:11.472
active position. They were going to give you a 
little bit of rest and put a new division up there.

22:15.785 --> 22:16.587
Yeah. Third division this time was going to 
replace us there. They had a little easier time.

22:24.240 --> 22:29.569
So the situation was like fighting with a tiger, 
you know, and they say, let that tiger eat you. I

22:30.951 --> 22:33.355
said, how am I going to get out of this village? It's 
night. I've got one platoon that's surrounded,

22:34.758 --> 22:37.763
almost surrounded. I'm going to have a heck of a 
time disengaging because the Germans don't want

22:39.498 --> 22:43.423
to disengage. We got into their village, and they 
want to get revenge and get us out. Well, I said, do

22:49.510 --> 22:54.216
the best you can, but be sure you're out by 12 
o'clock. So we had to leave those French tank. I

23:01.125 --> 23:04.209
think they got most of the wounded out of there. And 
that platoon that was almost cut off was able to, to

23:08.911 --> 23:12.314
get out and cover darkness. Now, you learn a lot of 
things in wartime, but I learned a lesson in the

23:12.334 --> 23:21.002
Strasburg. We were to occupy an island. If you've 
ever been to Strasburg, there's an island in the

23:22.863 --> 23:27.407
Rhine. And Strasburg is a port. And there's a whole 
row of warehouses for the river traffic,

23:31.031 --> 23:38.277
commercial traffic. And our mission was to 
occupy, defend. Strasburg, too, was an open city

23:45.155 --> 23:48.078
in itself. Now, the island all around each side, 
that wasn't considered open. So we moved in, and it

23:56.225 --> 23:57.766
was quiet. And we stayed there. And what I noticed 
as we went in there, there was a tower to the

24:00.148 --> 24:05.333
entrance to the harbor. And the big tower clock had 
been shut out. And the warehouses, of course

24:10.066 --> 24:20.099
you're taking a look at it, had been looted, at 
least broken into. Most of the valuable cargo

24:20.439 --> 24:26.888
had been taken. But everything was fine. And so the 
Burgermeister had been down to see me. I said,

24:36.053 --> 24:37.194
how's everything? He said, everything's fine. 
Yes, it's quiet. His troops have been very

24:40.397 --> 24:41.939
orderly. No problem. And we were ordered out. And I 
don't remember who replaced

24:46.383 --> 24:50.828
us. And we were on up, engaged again heavily along 
the Rhine River. This time we were providing the

24:57.955 --> 25:04.562
infantry troops for armor division. And the 
Inspector General came up, and there I was, you

25:06.698 --> 25:15.434
know, tired and sweating out all of this and trying 
to conduct the operation. He said, I hate to bother

25:15.494 --> 25:22.747
you, but I've got a very important subject to 
discuss with you. I said, yeah. He said, yes, have

25:24.670 --> 25:26.574
you got $2 million? I said, no, I haven't got 15 
cents. What are you getting at? He said, well, for

25:31.960 --> 25:50.146
your information, the Burgermeister of 
Sprossburg has submitted a claim against the

25:31.960 --> 25:50.146
American U.S. Army for $2 million for knocking out 
that clock and all that cargo that was in the

25:31.960 --> 25:50.146
warehouse that was stolen. I said, well, you're 
talking to the wrong person. Because it was out

25:53.792 --> 25:57.377
when we got there, both the clock and the cargo. He 
said, well, it couldn't have been. I said, well,

25:59.310 --> 26:00.492
why couldn't it have been? Maybe the 3rd Division 
got it. He said, no. The 3rd Division had the clean

26:03.775 --> 26:06.278
bill of health. When they left, they had the 
burglar master to sign that everything is just as

26:06.298 --> 26:13.306
they found it and nothing has been destroyed. And 
he said, don't worry about it because I'm sure that

26:14.447 --> 26:18.852
we can work this out. I know that you're telling the 
truth, but if I have this paperwork, I've got to run

26:19.773 --> 26:25.800
down. What had happened is The French, the first 
French army, they had liberated Strasbourg. They

26:35.656 --> 26:44.147
shot out the clock, and they hauled off, because 
they had a lot of chalk candy and things like that,

26:35.656 --> 26:44.147
you know, to wear out that car. They hauled all of 
that on. But the French didn't want to, you know,

26:46.571 --> 26:50.736
say the French did it. and I guess they figured that 
Uncle Sugar was coming along, and we might have

26:52.302 --> 26:58.169
paid for it. I never heard of it since. But that's 
what could happen. I mean, when you went into a

27:02.635 --> 27:16.392
German town and occupied it, you would have to sign 
chits saying that you had, you know, and have the

27:02.635 --> 27:16.392
Burgermeister sign them saying that you had not 
stolen any property. That's the only time I ever

27:16.432 --> 27:20.858
heard of that, but Strasburg is a situation that, 
What's different? There have been very, and I'm

27:22.424 --> 27:26.508
sure that the 3rd Division was smart enough to know 
that. You know, it's an open city, and if the

27:26.548 --> 27:37.659
Germans haven't tore things up, and we certainly 
don't want to be accused of sometimes soldiers,

27:26.548 --> 27:37.659
you know. Oh, yeah. They call it liberating. They 
go out and go into a house or store or a building and

27:39.400 --> 27:45.887
get a canvas or something else. So they had a clean 
bill of health signed with the Bergen-Meister.

27:51.044 --> 28:00.197
And I guess you can't blame him for not trying to get 
reimbursement for things, even in the middle of

27:51.044 --> 28:00.197
the war. Was this during the time of the Battle of 
the Bulge?

28:08.088 --> 28:10.772
No. We're still in France. I was in Germany during 
the Battle of the Bulge. We haven't crossed the

28:14.497 --> 28:15.619
Rhine yet. Okay, so this is before... December of 
1944. When is this?

28:27.041 --> 28:27.482
I don't know. I should have gotten... Well, I don't 
have my journals. That's right. I'll loan my

28:31.307 --> 28:34.991
journals to a guy who's writing a book. I have 
mostly journals.

28:41.179 --> 28:42.921
Who's journals?

28:54.275 --> 28:55.156
I can get his name. You've got that machine over 
there. Vincent M. Lockhart. And he's writing a

29:01.704 --> 29:05.569
book, A History of the 36th Division? In France and 
Germany.

29:10.575 --> 29:13.239
And was he in the division? Yeah. He was in the 
headquarters, but he was with the division almost

29:13.899 --> 29:20.047
the entire time. I left Texas with him and I came 
home on the day. Except for being

29:27.138 --> 29:33.206
in. OK. So rental. R&R I didn't miss a day with the 36 
today.

29:42.258 --> 29:42.979
Not one day. except going on that trip on and off. My 
goodness. Okay, so this is right before the Battle

29:49.330 --> 29:51.573
of the Bulge. What was the situation? Were you 
involved with that battle

29:53.415 --> 29:59.142
in December of 1940? Oh, in the Bulge. Or was that 
too far north of you? Oh, yes, north of it. Yeah. Was

30:06.090 --> 30:07.072
it too far north? Yeah. Because we went

30:13.233 --> 30:16.397
We went into Germany at Wissenberg.

30:20.241 --> 30:25.226
And that was through the secret line. And

30:25.507 --> 30:42.666
that, too, was another example where rather than 
decimate your troops on the frontal attack in the

30:25.507 --> 30:42.666
lowland,

30:25.507 --> 30:42.666
my battalion was sent through the mountain, where 
we still had a pretty strong defense, but not like

30:43.304 --> 30:54.477
it was down where it was designed, you know, for 
anti-tank guns. And we were able to get through the

30:54.497 --> 31:01.385
sacred line without very many casualties. But we 
lost a tank going through and in the village, five

31:01.405 --> 31:11.397
pounds or thousands on the second story, you know, 
and fired it down on them. It was terrible because

31:11.417 --> 31:12.518
they, It was a lieutenant in the tank, had the 
turret open with his head out. It was a night, see,

31:18.814 --> 31:22.058
so, and it was quiet. I see the panther's out there. 
So he shot that thing down there and tore his head,

31:24.402 --> 31:30.010
practically, off. Of course, he killed and missed 
him. And knocked out the tank, and it went on down

31:33.636 --> 31:37.862
there and set it to fire. Did it kill everybody in 
the tank? I don't recall. I haven't thought about

31:45.445 --> 31:47.829
these things in years. I can remember the 
incident, and I can see that gory mass of

31:48.349 --> 31:58.603
splattered brain and just the stem of his neck 
sticking out. And they got his body out before the

31:58.643 --> 32:04.031
tank really got to burn. And it was able to push the 
tank, too, out of the street. It was a narrow

32:06.193 --> 32:09.979
street, so the rest of the column got burned. But we 
left it burning. So how many of the others were

32:11.375 --> 32:13.978
killed or got out? I don't know.

32:18.144 --> 32:35.707
Most of the tanks, you know, have an escape hatch at 
the bottom that you can get in or out.

32:35.727 --> 32:39.171
Now, what was the condition of the Siegfried line 
when you approached it? Was it heavily damaged or

32:39.211 --> 32:41.314
was it... in pretty good shape.

32:45.888 --> 32:51.415
We put down a terrific artillery barrage on that 
thing. And the mountains. Now, they had bunkers

32:52.496 --> 32:56.762
and they were manned and with crossfire. But 
nothing like down in the Rhine plain. Boy, that

33:02.069 --> 33:08.717
was... Not only had bunkers, but they had big tank 
ditches, you know. Mine and barbed wire. And, uh,

33:12.766 --> 33:17.133
They were designed that neither man nor machine 
could get through those things.

33:20.058 --> 33:22.421
Up in the mountains, they had the bunkers. They had 
protective wire around the bunkers where you

33:24.324 --> 33:29.853
couldn't get close enough to lob hand grenades 
under the portal.

33:32.778 --> 33:38.447
But this just shows you how to protect the bunker. 
They had defensive foxholes around the bunker

33:41.892 --> 33:44.855
outside. So I imagine psychologically, they just 
didn't feel like being sitting in there and

33:44.915 --> 33:53.884
waiting for somebody with a flamethrower or 
something to stick it through them. And that was

33:54.685 --> 33:59.770
the reason why we had low casualties going through 
that, because that artillery. There weren't many

34:01.271 --> 34:02.612
Germans left. For some reason, either ordered to 
leave or something. They weren't there. There

34:07.077 --> 34:10.380
were some just for snipers who took prisoners. 
Maybe they want to be taken care of. But we were

34:14.543 --> 34:20.171
prepared for a really tough fight getting through 
that city. Once again, luck comes to you without

34:20.191 --> 34:26.159
having to do

34:20.191 --> 34:26.159
anything. Then we went on to the Rhine River for the 
crossing. And

34:31.287 --> 34:40.620
we were getting ready to make a river crossing at 
this ferry

34:41.292 --> 34:45.959
landing. It was the bridge that was the ferry. And 
so often in Germany there's a tavern on one side of

34:49.525 --> 34:54.773
the river. This is on our side of the river. And it 
was there just before daylight. It was cold, damp,

35:01.503 --> 35:07.792
and we were all moving around, getting all set. 
About that time, in that cavern. Let go of it. You

35:13.834 --> 35:20.664
know one of these Germans where they played the 
umpah and got drums, you know, the whole thing, a

35:13.834 --> 35:20.664
player, piano type of thing. That thing started

35:21.065 --> 35:28.756
running.

35:28.776 --> 35:32.001
We got somebody to find out what the hell that is. 
Some G.I. had been in there and somehow he had

35:33.163 --> 35:37.409
tripped that thing where, you know, like any G.I. 
looking around, what is this thing? He got it

35:38.911 --> 35:40.273
started playing. But the Germans didn't resist 
across the Rhine there. No kidding? They must have

35:46.978 --> 35:49.300
been concentrated up north, huh? Yeah. And this 
was a... You could have been slaughtered. This is

35:56.067 --> 36:06.438
a...

35:56.067 --> 36:06.438
And we got across there, and of course, they had a 
big fight up in Remagen Bridgehead. That was a

36:06.458 --> 36:10.723
great... Of course, that was up in industrial 
parts down there. Yeah.

36:18.982 --> 36:24.509
In fact, we claimed, Seventh Army claimed, we were 
the first one to cross the Rhine. And I think the

36:26.952 --> 36:28.615
same on the Remagen. And when you got... See, when 
you're down on one end and you're fighting like

36:30.817 --> 36:38.247
we're still in there, you really don't know what 
the hell's going on.

36:41.671 --> 36:48.280
I wasn't aware of any of the Battle of the Bulge 
until later on. We felt the effects because they

36:48.918 --> 36:55.746
picked up several Germans in American uniforms. 
Oh, really?

37:01.313 --> 37:01.413
Yeah. And they called them with a password. You 
know, they'd figure out everything, like the

37:03.595 --> 37:06.278
Germans being smart. But they can't master 
baseball, for example. You know, you start asking

37:12.386 --> 37:16.090
her about pictures and who did this. different 
things like that. So these guys were sabotaged,

37:18.387 --> 37:21.130
you were going to sabotage them? Yeah, I was part of 
a whole system of those. We didn't know at the time,

37:24.214 --> 37:28.139
all at once, we got the word to be very suspicious of 
anybody going there. Germans dressed in American

37:28.239 --> 37:31.302
uniforms, driving jeeps.

37:34.006 --> 37:37.150
My battalion didn't capture any of them, but the 
regiment did. Captured two jeep loads full of

37:37.210 --> 37:39.733
these men. No kidding. They were the most 
GI-looking characters you've ever seen.

37:48.537 --> 37:52.142
They later admitted that they were German. They 
wouldn't tell what their mission was if they were

37:52.423 --> 37:54.666
German. They may have got more information if they 
evacuated.

38:01.416 --> 38:03.459
And then you continued your drive into Germany. 
Yeah. And

38:08.126 --> 38:13.995
we went across the Rhine at another place. And this 
was down near Mannheim. And you know who was

38:21.284 --> 38:24.048
directing traffic there at that crossing? It was a 
ponton bridge, General Patton. No kidding. He was

38:29.355 --> 38:40.269
out there directing traffic, because he was 
trying to get the infantry unit across, because he

38:29.355 --> 38:40.269
had an armor division that was coming. He wanted to 
get them all cleared out. Of course, he was

38:41.931 --> 38:44.835
dissatisfied with what the MPs were doing, I had 
the

38:45.642 --> 39:06.595
first experience I had with General Patton, the 
only experience, except this, and I was just

38:45.642 --> 39:06.595
passing by, was in the Louisiana Maneuvers. Oh, 
yeah, he was down there. Yeah, he was testing.

39:10.180 --> 39:11.903
Yeah, he was testing his... Well, it was the early 
40s. Was it 1940? 1940. He commanded the armored

39:18.934 --> 39:22.598
unit at Fort Bennett. And he, of course, being a 
scholar all of his life on the professional

39:22.618 --> 39:42.784
warrants and military leaders and tactics and 
strategies, he knew about the German blitzkrieg

39:22.618 --> 39:42.784
tactics of using panzers and infantry, 
fast-moving infantry. In the past, you know, they

39:44.013 --> 39:49.662
had tank units and they had infantry units, and 
they both fought their own kind of war. Of course,

39:51.184 --> 39:54.469
in World War II, they just had a very primitive 
tank. And not many of them were not very

39:56.873 --> 40:00.919
successful. World War I. Yeah, World War I. So he's 
going to test this out during this maneuver. So the

40:09.372 --> 40:11.235
143rd Infantry. of the Texas National Guard was 
attached to his unit for this particular

40:12.852 --> 40:18.979
operation. And so I reported to his headquarters 
as liaison officer. And of course, you know

40:28.070 --> 40:31.514
liaison officer, you're not one of the other 
liaison officers. Your job is to keep abreast of

40:33.997 --> 40:42.167
the situation as much as you can in that 
headquarters without being truces to get in the

40:33.997 --> 40:42.167
way being noticed too much. So you kind of slip 
around and look and listen. And your main job, of

40:50.481 --> 40:54.225
course, is to know where your unit is at all times. 
Because that's the purpose of you being there. So

40:57.848 --> 41:01.431
you expedite.

41:01.451 --> 41:03.293
Those days we didn't have much communication.

41:06.196 --> 41:10.500
Nothing like now with the radio and also telephone 
wire. And Patton was in the headquarters? He was

41:14.359 --> 41:16.543
there. Patton has a real high voice. You'd like for 
him to be like old George Scott, you know, and

41:21.510 --> 41:28.480
Patton, with that growling speech he made, you 
know, up on the platform. But he had kind of a

41:29.241 --> 41:31.765
high-pitched voice like that. And when he got 
excited, it would go really high. Vulgar curse

41:36.752 --> 41:40.858
word, boy, he just spewed them out all three and 
four and every sentence. So obviously, people

41:42.323 --> 41:46.490
didn't get around General Patton unless he called 
them. I mean, he didn't want to get his iron. Then I

41:49.494 --> 41:52.359
remember that an officer came in. He had sent for 
him. And he was just raving. Gosh, he was chewing

41:56.505 --> 41:59.810
the poor guy up. And what he had done, or not done, he 
failed to meet the rendezvous with a tank truck

41:59.830 --> 42:07.943
that was going to refuel his tank. Of course, 
that's a cardinal sin because the tank's not worth

42:08.277 --> 42:11.563
it. It can't move. Circumstances doesn't make any 
difference. General Patton was saying it didn't

42:16.511 --> 42:18.976
occur. It didn't happen. As far as I'm concerned, 
you're the commander. You're at fault because you

42:23.624 --> 42:25.708
didn't make it happen. You should have been there. 
You should have been supervised. Train your

42:28.372 --> 42:30.516
people differently. Then after all of that, he 
turned. to the other people he's talking to, and

42:33.016 --> 42:37.382
you'd think that he was conducting a Sunday school 
class. Just like that, he came from a grower maniac

42:37.862 --> 42:43.390
type of innovation.

42:44.872 --> 42:47.095
And what did he say to these other people when he 
turned? I don't know. They were talking about

42:48.797 --> 42:56.948
whatever they were talking before that guy got 
there, something about what they were going to do.

42:57.417 --> 43:01.563
I heard him yell, where's that liaison officer 
from the 143rd Infantry? Boy, I went over there and

43:01.623 --> 43:03.346
saluted him. Lieutenant Andrews reported, sir. 
He says, do you know where your unit is? Of course,

43:10.898 --> 43:13.922
if I didn't know, I wouldn't have told him. Yes, 
sir. All right, he says, I want you to go get that

43:15.985 --> 43:23.016
regiment, and I want you to have the lead column at 
this road junction. And he gave me the hour. I don't

43:24.539 --> 43:25.500
remember what it was. Can you get them there? And I 
said, yes, sir. Well, get going then. So off I went.

43:31.434 --> 43:34.058
And I knew generally where they were if they still 
lay. And I found them, gave the commanding officer

43:35.219 --> 43:40.406
the message of what they were supposed to do. And 
off we went. We got to the road junction, but by the

43:42.088 --> 43:47.596
time we got there, he had already gone in his 
column. And he's been criticized for this because

43:48.957 --> 43:53.243
he was a very wealthy man. Sometimes he didn't even 
cash his paycheck or anything. So he took that tank

43:59.970 --> 44:05.719
column through East Texas, off limits, really. 
You know, the river. I guess that's the Sabine

44:06.740 --> 44:11.327
River, isn't it, or whatever it is. So as a result, 
and how did he do it? He used his own personal funds

44:14.072 --> 44:16.876
to purchase gasoline. He went on ahead and had 
somebody arrange for refueling these tanks from

44:17.337 --> 44:23.466
commercial sources. And he went all the way around 
to Shreveport and came back, you know, and ended

44:23.716 --> 44:29.103
the maneuver prematurely. And they said, well, 
you shouldn't have done that. He said, well,

44:32.227 --> 44:33.368
that's war. You've got to watch. You have to expect 
the unexpected. And he says, I just wanted to prove

44:37.393 --> 44:40.217
that what armor can do. And I was never unhappy 
because we never caught up with him or not, never to

44:42.840 --> 44:46.604
hear about that. But that was my experience with 
Patton. What did you think of him as far as a

44:50.049 --> 44:52.071
military leader? Well...

44:56.420 --> 45:12.295
You take our leaders, which I think are considered 
to be among our best, would be Patton, and probably

44:56.420 --> 45:12.295
our best would be Marshall, and yet MacArthur, of 
course, Eisenhower. All of them are different.

45:14.717 --> 45:23.206
Probably the one who has all of the qualities, 
intelligence, leadership,

45:14.717 --> 45:23.206
intellectual. I already said intelligence, but 
really would be Marshall. You know, if you're

45:27.729 --> 45:29.351
looking for the total man. Each of the others have a 
little something. Now Patton, I think he was a, he

45:33.556 --> 45:42.686
was a good armored leader. He loved tanks and 
gasoline, the smell of it and the grease and all

45:44.168 --> 45:50.676
that sort of thing. He's not a leader in all 
situations, that's evident, obvious, when he

45:50.909 --> 46:00.157
struck that soldier, you know.

46:00.177 --> 46:02.239
Mean like that, he wouldn't accept anything. Then 
to, yeah, after hitting him, or before hitting

46:02.740 --> 46:17.173
him, yelling about, like, coward, yeller, you 
ought to get out there, look at those men there,

46:02.740 --> 46:17.173
they've been wounded fighting, nothing wrong 
with you, yeller, coward. And that's when he

46:17.193 --> 46:19.735
struck him. He was a real scholar. He studied. He 
researched.

46:30.661 --> 46:32.383
He was a good man to have in Europe. But you couldn't 
give him all the gasoline like he wanted and just

46:32.564 --> 46:37.991
let him go wild. So you have to be a team player. But 
then you have to be tempered with a great

46:39.593 --> 46:47.764
MacArthur, for example.

46:51.507 --> 46:56.343
I never really

46:51.507 --> 46:56.343
met him or talked to him. I stood beside him one 
time.
