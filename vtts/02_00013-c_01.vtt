00:02.140 --> 00:04.264
Greeks said, goodbye, no mind.

00:04.345 --> 00:06.168
That's the closest they get to bye-bye, stupid.

00:06.669 --> 00:11.800
They had made this out of epoxy and green ink and blue ink and made a mold.

00:12.401 --> 00:15.708
And Fred Van Dornick, being the classical scholar, had written the Greek.

00:16.149 --> 00:17.331
And it really had me fooled.

00:17.932 --> 00:20.638
However, I then had to pass a law.

00:20.618 --> 00:33.570
which has been held since then, any person ever found salting the wreck would be dismissed immediately because of the danger of something not being found and having it turn up in 500 or 1,000 years.

00:33.950 --> 00:50.085
And that has actually probably happened because Pete DeJong, P-I-E-T-D-E-J-O-N-G, was the little Cockney artist who drew for all the archaeologists, classical archaeologists in the Mediterranean, in Greece,

00:50.065 --> 00:51.206
for decades.

00:51.306 --> 00:53.309
I knew him when he was in his 70s or 80s.

00:53.869 --> 01:05.543
And he told me once that passing the time once with a bunch of discarded pottery, potsherders from some dig, he was carving names like Themistocles and so forth.

01:06.104 --> 01:07.786
And then they somehow got misplaced.

01:07.806 --> 01:10.289
And next thing he knew, they'd just been sent into the museum.

01:10.649 --> 01:12.411
He said he was too embarrassed to tell anybody.

01:12.431 --> 01:18.418
Well, of course, the word ostracon means a piece of broken pottery.

01:18.398 --> 01:24.835
And we get our word ostracized because people would carve onto a piece of broken pottery the name of the person to be exiled.

01:25.356 --> 01:30.349
And so he said, I have no idea if anything like that's ever been actually found or published.

01:30.869 --> 01:35.117
You know, there's the potential for somebody to get their history all wrong.

01:36.801 --> 01:48.945
I once realized I'd picked up some Greek pot sherds walking through a field in Greece, and I was in central Anatolia on another dig, and I reached into the jacket pocket and realized I hadn't ever discarded them.

01:48.925 --> 01:54.371
And I carefully took them all the way back to Greece, because what if I dropped them there in the center of Turkey?

01:54.831 --> 02:00.918
Some student would have written a dissertation about these Iron Age Greeks that set up camp there at Gordian, you see.

02:01.018 --> 02:03.921
And so you have to be careful with archaeological finds.

02:05.823 --> 02:12.250
For you personally, have you ever had any, in hindsight, any dangerous

02:12.230 --> 02:21.688
What we fear most clearly is simply drowning and very fortunately we've not, I'm superstitious about all this.

02:21.988 --> 02:31.386
I never like to brag about our safe diving record because when we've had our few accidents it's always been when

02:31.366 --> 02:35.571
When I've honestly thought or just said to somebody, boy, it's going so well.

02:35.671 --> 02:36.673
You look at this beautiful day.

02:36.713 --> 02:42.320
And then Eric Ryan gets an embolism where somebody probably cuts a finger off or something like that.

02:43.000 --> 02:43.942
We worry about drowning.

02:44.182 --> 02:45.884
That has not yet happened, thank goodness.

02:46.304 --> 02:47.346
We worry about the bends.

02:47.726 --> 02:48.888
We have a doctor with us.

02:48.908 --> 02:49.629
We have a chamber.

02:49.929 --> 02:51.150
And so we treat the bends.

02:51.190 --> 02:53.273
But we have very, very few cases.

02:53.253 --> 02:57.101
But those are the major things.

02:57.142 --> 03:05.340
I think we almost worry as much about somebody simply falling from a moving boat and hitting their head on something, a slippery deck, as anything else.

03:06.262 --> 03:08.747
So we do always have a physician with us, or we try to.

03:08.727 --> 03:15.075
Is it normal for people to get an upset stomach, to have a cold?

03:15.796 --> 03:29.252
We've had a lot of that, but very little in the last few years, and people are crediting it to our eating better, having Angie Mitchell as our cook, and Jane somebody, another English cook.

03:29.693 --> 03:31.175
People eat very, very well.

03:31.195 --> 03:36.321
They're not losing weight, and we don't know if that's doing it, but we have very, very

03:38.242 --> 03:44.370
incredibly lesser number of infected ears, infected sinuses, upset stomachs.

03:44.971 --> 03:55.264
Are there some foods that you all concentrate on and some others that you... She, knowing us, she's, I don't think she's a dietician, but she uses common sense, packs us with lots and lots of carbohydrates.

03:55.304 --> 04:04.456
We have, you know, we always have lots of spaghetti and, not lots like we're eating spaghetti all the time, but potato salad, you know, a lot of heavy things.

04:04.476 --> 04:05.818
She loves to make cakes.

04:05.798 --> 04:14.700
And as I say, we used to lose weight every summer and now we don't, which is too bad for some of us that want to, but for the thinner people it's not a bad thing.

04:15.381 --> 04:22.238
When a project is underway, about how many people are normally there at one time?

04:22.218 --> 04:26.209
On a major excavation, we'll have about 30, 30 or 35.

04:26.390 --> 04:27.934
And they'll be there for three months?

04:28.636 --> 04:29.157
If possible.

04:29.177 --> 04:32.487
Last time we had three months with about 30 people, maybe slightly more.

04:33.008 --> 04:37.240
Does everybody go at about the same time and come home at about the same time?

04:37.220 --> 04:38.141
Not quite.

04:38.181 --> 04:41.886
The Turkish students usually come later and can stay later, which is kind of nice.

04:42.307 --> 04:46.412
Like our American students have to leave, say, by the 20th of August to get back to term here.

04:46.853 --> 04:55.364
But the Turkish students can stay later, so we work on until about the 15th of September, which is nice because our permit staff can stay that late.

04:55.665 --> 04:58.789
Describe how the American students and the Turkish students mesh.

04:59.714 --> 05:02.939
I think we're unaware that we're different nationalities.

05:03.139 --> 05:22.347
One of the things that's happened is that I've been on our little ship, Virazon, sitting, you know, having a drink in the evening, or coffee in the afternoon, or eating a meal, and suddenly realized that Claude Dutwy, I said I was going to mention his name later, is sitting opposite me, and he's French, and Tufan will be next to me, and he's Turkish, and

05:22.327 --> 05:31.391
Robin Peercy will be next to me and he's English and, you know, we can have five nationalities sitting there and we're totally oblivious to this.

05:32.113 --> 05:34.099
How do you stay during those three months?

05:34.119 --> 05:38.310
How do you stay in communication with the rest of the world as to what's happening?

05:38.493 --> 05:46.825
In the old days I had a little portable radio and I'd listen to either the Voice of America news or the BBC every night.

05:50.070 --> 05:55.538
We don't tend to do that so much anymore because people were coming out and bringing newspapers.

05:55.578 --> 05:58.763
I had the same radio this summer and never turned it on to the Voice of America once.

05:59.384 --> 06:08.596
Do you remember during any of those experiences hearing some event of worldwide importance that stunned you?

06:08.616 --> 06:08.796
Oh, yes.

06:08.956 --> 06:09.036
Yes.

06:09.056 --> 06:09.457
Such as?

06:10.138 --> 06:17.387
Tiananmen Square I listened to every night on this little portable radio, and it got more and more tense, and then everybody thought it was okay.

06:17.948 --> 06:21.833
So I thought, oh, the first night I hadn't listened to the news that summer probably.

06:21.853 --> 06:29.222
I thought I don't have to listen tonight, and that was the night of the massacre, I guess is the word that we use.

06:29.202 --> 06:30.586
Because I got that the next night.

06:31.047 --> 06:32.531
So that was something world-shanking.

06:33.353 --> 06:42.037
Oz Alprazan, the director of the Beaudry Museum, got word passed down to him on a clipboard that his second son was born.

06:43.039 --> 06:44.764
And he loves to tell that story.

06:44.744 --> 07:04.013
Then the other one, of course, was listening to every single second of the Cyprus war, because we were in Turkey on this little desert island, Rock Island, where our camp was, and we were listening to the war going on in Cyprus, wondering how to get back, what had happened to our homes, and what would be our future.

07:04.814 --> 07:05.655
So we'd listen to that.

07:06.437 --> 07:09.061
Now, things have changed so much.

07:11.244 --> 07:14.008
My children, they're my two sons who are now grown and married,

07:14.967 --> 07:29.913
And Ann, my wife, all say without hesitation, the most pleasant year of our lives was 1979-80 when I got sort of like a sabbatical from here and went to Turkey.

07:30.073 --> 07:34.801
And we lived in the bottom floor of a three-story house.

07:34.821 --> 07:38.427
We had no television, no telephone, no car.

07:39.065 --> 07:40.988
No computers in those days.

07:41.068 --> 07:42.750
No Daily English newspaper?

07:42.770 --> 07:42.971
No.

07:43.391 --> 07:45.534
Well, actually, the Daily News, we'd get it late.

07:45.654 --> 07:46.415
Oh, okay.

07:46.435 --> 07:47.177
We could get that.

07:49.320 --> 07:55.368
The entire heap of the house was a little wood stove in the living room, and the wood was delivered by a camel.

07:58.052 --> 08:02.338
We'd go collecting driftwood, though, or picking up pine cones in the forest for it.

08:02.318 --> 08:04.361
And what did we do at night?

08:04.402 --> 08:06.926
We'd sit around when it was bitter cold outside.

08:06.946 --> 08:09.691
It goes down just like it does in College Station to almost freezing.

08:10.171 --> 08:13.237
We'd sit around this little wood stove when the kids were 9 and 12 years old and they would read.

08:14.158 --> 08:17.904
Or we'd listen to maybe a tape on my little cheap portable radio.

08:18.746 --> 08:22.352
And I had a typewriter, manual typewriter, and we were very happy.

08:22.737 --> 08:26.083
Now, sometimes I think, why do I bother to go to Bodrum?

08:26.103 --> 08:27.685
Because I have my own house there.

08:27.705 --> 08:28.627
We have built a house.

08:29.148 --> 08:31.031
And I have a television.

08:31.091 --> 08:34.116
I've got a satellite so I can watch the BBC news and English every day.

08:34.136 --> 08:35.879
I followed the entire election just now.

08:35.919 --> 08:41.628
The BBC, that was the lead story between Gore and Bush.

08:42.670 --> 08:43.611
So I got to follow that.

08:43.652 --> 08:45.775
In fact, they'd break in for live events.

08:45.755 --> 08:52.908
I've got a computer in my house where I can check CNN news or the Washington Post every morning if I feel like it.

08:54.070 --> 08:58.859
We have a telephone with an answering machine, our own car, central heating.

08:59.761 --> 09:02.847
And yet nobody says it's the most pleasant year of their life anymore.

09:03.548 --> 09:08.337
And I'm assuming that during all of these years English was the proof.

09:08.317 --> 09:08.818
Yes.

09:09.118 --> 09:12.083
My Turkish is embarrassing, frankly.

09:12.925 --> 09:20.257
A Turkish archaeologist I know, a very pleasant woman, chided me and said to me, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

09:20.638 --> 09:24.064
Your Turkish was much better 25 or 30 years ago than it is today.

09:24.424 --> 09:26.648
Because when I first went there, I had to do the customs.

09:26.868 --> 09:27.750
I had to get the permits.

09:28.311 --> 09:32.097
I had to deal with the local police and so forth in Bogdan, none of whom spoke English.

09:32.650 --> 09:35.094
Now I've got a staff that speaks English as well as I do.

09:35.134 --> 09:39.420
People who meet Jamal Pulak say, here in Texas, I'll say, I want you to meet Jamal Pulak.

09:39.781 --> 09:41.183
And they misunderstand his name.

09:41.203 --> 09:42.485
They say, well, howdy, Jim, Al.

09:43.146 --> 09:44.788
And they speak with that accent.

09:45.429 --> 09:52.980
So now I have other people go get the permits and get the, you know, do the shopping and keep the books and deal with the workers and all that.

09:53.341 --> 09:56.886
So my Turkish has got so bad that this past spring, Ann and I,

09:56.866 --> 10:02.833
took two months of intensive Turkish in Izmir, four hours a day, plus five or six hours of homework every day.

10:02.873 --> 10:07.940
And I wrote essays and learned another thousand words and learned perfect grammar.

10:08.380 --> 10:11.885
And then immediately got back to Bodrum and got lazy because we were all speaking English.

10:12.265 --> 10:13.787
And I went back to my Tarzan Turkish.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.649
And it's unfortunate.

10:16.971 --> 10:20.095
When I lived in Greece, after two years, I was almost fluent.

10:20.115 --> 10:23.599
But I never did that in Turkish because

10:23.579 --> 10:28.809
Well, there was one reason, and that is in the early days we never thought we were going to be there after 40 years.

10:28.929 --> 10:35.381
We thought, well, we'll be here another year, we'll be here another year, and then one year after another, after another, after another, and then suddenly 40 years has gone by.

10:35.842 --> 10:43.917
Compare the bureaucratic routine of going from the United States to Turkey

10:44.639 --> 10:46.821
Thirty years ago and now.

10:48.263 --> 10:49.004
Is it easier?

10:49.244 --> 10:49.885
It's harder now.

10:49.985 --> 10:50.265
Harder?

10:50.545 --> 10:52.427
It's more bureaucratic, yeah.

10:52.447 --> 10:59.415
In those days we could just pick up a guy coming along the coast with a diving equipment and say, hey, you want to join us as one of our divers.

10:59.555 --> 11:08.605
Now we have to send in six months in advance at least, not only an application to renew our permit,

11:08.585 --> 11:15.875
but a list of everyone who's coming in, you know, mother's name, father's name, birthplace, birthdate, all this information.

11:16.335 --> 11:21.442
And then they have to check out all these people through their Ministry of the Interior and secret police and military.

11:22.404 --> 11:27.671
And so it takes, it's much harder to do now.

11:27.771 --> 11:33.158
And sometimes, I mean, sometimes, like last year, a new permit,

11:33.138 --> 11:36.071
has to be signed by every single minister in Turkey.

11:36.111 --> 11:39.385
Well it was an election year, they all had electioneering, so I went to Turkey

11:39.736 --> 11:43.042
ready to start on June 1st, and we did not get our permit.

11:43.102 --> 11:46.087
And here I was with 15 or 20 Texas A&M students.

11:46.107 --> 11:48.952
We did not get our permit until August 7th.

11:49.132 --> 11:50.574
Oh my goodness.

11:50.715 --> 12:04.478
Now, what saved us, what saved us is the Ministry of Culture and the Department of the Director of Antiquities were sympathetic, and so they said that we could prepare the site for excavation.

12:04.458 --> 12:13.107
And we had a commissioner diving with us, and that meant that we started measuring it and mapping it, and then removing a little of the sand and cleaning it.

12:13.668 --> 12:16.871
And so, in a way, we were excavating it, but we weren't raising any objects.

12:17.312 --> 12:22.617
So we didn't waste the whole summer, but I still must have suffered a many nervous breakdown before it was over.

12:22.677 --> 12:23.819
It was the worst summer of my life.

12:24.159 --> 12:25.360
Whereas this year, we got our permit.

12:25.841 --> 12:31.427
On June 15th, we started work, and everybody said, I have so many messages saying it was the nicest summer that I'd ever spent in the field.

12:32.068 --> 12:33.469
It's just all the difference in the world.

12:33.905 --> 12:42.974
And you, as a veteran, to get from College Station to Bodrum takes how long?

12:43.394 --> 12:48.039
I can get back, I can wake up in my bed in Bodrum, Turkey, and sleep in my bed here that night.

12:48.599 --> 12:49.020
Really?

12:49.040 --> 12:54.925
And it used to be when I traveled from here to New York by train, then took a ship and all that, it was like two weeks.

12:55.786 --> 12:55.926
Yes.

12:56.247 --> 13:02.713
Now, it used to be like a seven or eight, the first year ten, and then later seven hour drive from Izmir,

13:03.031 --> 13:13.607
And so we could fly to Izmir, or we could fly to Athens, take an overnight ferry boat to the Greek island of Kos, and that's only one hour by fishing boat, and now big ferry boats and hydrofoils to Bodrum.

13:14.589 --> 13:28.009
So there are a number of ways of getting there, but today it's, I fly to Istanbul, transfer to a flight directly from Istanbul to New York, and then fly from New York to Houston, and Ann will meet me in Houston, and I'll be in bed the same day.

13:27.989 --> 13:33.040
In all of your years over there, have you ever needed any medical attention off-site?

13:33.461 --> 13:35.666
That is, you had to go to the hospital or to the clinic?

13:35.927 --> 13:36.348
Oh, yes.

13:37.250 --> 13:45.508
I was Bob Ballard, the fellow who found the Titanic, and Jack Kelly, who was one of the founding directors of I&E, whose name has come up.

13:46.180 --> 13:52.846
And we got on a plane to fly between Istanbul and Sampson, where Bob Ballard's been doing this deep work.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.669
He's been making a lot of news, finding well-preserved wrecks in the Black Sea.

13:56.690 --> 13:59.032
And before the plane took off, he was taxiing it.

13:59.472 --> 14:05.117
Suddenly, my foot went to sleep, and then my leg went to sleep, and then my side went to sleep, and my arm went to sleep, and my cheek went to sleep.

14:05.758 --> 14:08.540
And I kept moving around like that, and I realized that I was having a stroke.

14:09.241 --> 14:12.344
So I pushed for the bell for the flight attendant.

14:12.384 --> 14:15.867
She came back looking very annoyed, like, don't you realize we're taxiing?

14:15.847 --> 14:20.973
And I said, which means in Turkish, on this side it's like I'm asleep.

14:21.654 --> 14:27.041
The man next to me was a Turkish doctor and he told her to get down his bag and he gave me an aspirin, which is the best thing you can do.

14:27.662 --> 14:28.783
The pilot stopped the plane.

14:28.823 --> 14:34.751
It was a regular commercial Turkish Airlines, you know, Boeing 737, I guess.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.534
And he came back.

14:38.915 --> 14:40.357
and said, would I like to get off?

14:41.478 --> 14:48.708
And I thought, well, what in the world am I going to do if I get off with my suitcase in the middle of the runway and start yelling, help, I'm having a stroke?

14:48.728 --> 14:49.889
And I said, no, I'll go on.

14:50.590 --> 14:58.701
In Ballard's group was the just-retired dean of the medical school from Yale, one of the trustees of his Institute for Exploration.

14:59.121 --> 15:00.964
So he came back and sat with me.

15:01.725 --> 15:02.586
And I said, I'll go on.

15:02.966 --> 15:04.348
I didn't know whether the pressure

15:04.818 --> 15:07.782
would drive that a lot farther in my brain, and I might die.

15:07.802 --> 15:09.745
I mean, I thought maybe I'll die before we get there.

15:09.765 --> 15:10.286
I said, I'll go on.

15:11.287 --> 15:12.229
At least I'm with people I know.

15:12.970 --> 15:21.001
So we were met by a minibus, and I went to the state hospital there, connected to a university in Sampson.

15:22.263 --> 15:25.628
And they laid me down, and Lord my blood bless you, I guess, or whatever you do.

15:25.688 --> 15:28.171
And it was wonderful.

15:28.271 --> 15:32.337
I had an English-speaking urologist who attends meetings in Europe all the time.

15:33.238 --> 15:34.420
I had a CAT scan.

15:34.822 --> 15:37.266
I had sonograms of my heart, my carotid arteries.

15:38.128 --> 15:40.892
I had EKG.

15:42.375 --> 15:45.320
And you can't really do much for a stroke, you know.

15:45.380 --> 15:48.845
But I had round-the-clock care.

15:49.426 --> 15:54.535
And the residents would all come in, you know, do all their things, pricking me with needles to see where I'd get any feeling.

15:54.515 --> 15:59.908
And I had a private room, which I think they gave me because I was a foreigner, with a television set in the remote.

16:00.409 --> 16:03.997
So on the 4th of July, I remember lying there watching Wimbledon in color.

16:04.799 --> 16:06.744
And it was wonderful.

16:07.345 --> 16:08.929
Now, I have to say,

16:10.428 --> 16:15.095
In the early 1960s, if I had appendicitis in a camp, I'd be dead.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.218
And I had a ruptured appendix here at College Station.

16:17.418 --> 16:22.305
I was reading papers one night and got a pain, went to the hospital, it ruptured, and I'd have been dead.

16:22.526 --> 16:30.377
And I might have even been dead in Bodrum, because the medical facilities there were just filthy and you know, it was awful.

16:30.357 --> 16:34.403
However, now there is a modern hospital in Bodrum.

16:34.423 --> 16:39.872
Things have changed so much that an 18-year-old son of one of our sponsors was there, one of our patrons.

16:40.453 --> 16:41.695
He complained of stomach pains.

16:41.715 --> 16:42.717
He was taken to the hospital.

16:43.258 --> 16:52.112
And before he was operated on for appendicitis, his English-speaking doctor was speaking to the boy's physician in California by telephone to describe it.

16:52.132 --> 16:54.335
He was up in a few days and did just fine.

16:54.656 --> 16:56.719
That would not have happened in the past.

16:56.918 --> 17:01.285
Let's see, proudest moments.

17:01.425 --> 17:03.649
Your proudest moments during all these years.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.412
This summer?

17:05.692 --> 17:06.113
Highlights.

17:06.193 --> 17:06.654
This summer.

17:07.715 --> 17:08.597
Two things happened.

17:08.877 --> 17:14.286
On the 23rd of July, I didn't know they were going to ask me to do this.

17:14.266 --> 17:27.932
But there were probably 500 people there, including 50 people from the states and abroad, to attend the ribbon cutting of the new building devoted to the Bronze Age shipwrecks we've excavated in the Bodrum Castle, which is a 15th century castle.

17:29.235 --> 17:31.700
We called it a Crusader Castle, even though the Crusades were over.

17:31.740 --> 17:34.485
It was a place for Christians to go on the way to Rhodes and so forth.

17:35.410 --> 17:43.323
And at the last minute, they grabbed my arm and shoved me up, and there was probably fifteen television cameras and reporters and flash bulbs.

17:44.024 --> 17:47.630
And they wanted me to hold the hand of the Minister of Culture to cut the ribbon to open it.

17:48.131 --> 17:53.059
And it is one of the most incredible museum exhibits you can see in the world today.

17:53.099 --> 17:57.807
And Oz Alpazan, the director of the museum, who came to learn to dive with us,

17:57.787 --> 18:02.353
when he was an undergraduate archaeology student at Istanbul University in 1962.

18:02.453 --> 18:05.157
So we've been together for almost four decades.

18:06.579 --> 18:21.599
He had the main room, you're working on a balcony, overlooking up on the opposite wall a full-scale replica cut away in half of the Bronze Age shipwreck excavated with all the cargo put back in place and people on the deck and so forth.

18:22.079 --> 18:26.325
And then you look down and you see what the wrecked look on the seabed, a diorama,

18:26.305 --> 18:27.587
All of this is replicated.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.908
I mean, none of the original stuff is there.

18:29.329 --> 18:30.811
With blue and green light playing on it.

18:31.271 --> 18:34.295
And you stand there, and I've been getting chills even thinking about it.

18:34.695 --> 18:42.165
People just are in awe of looking at this 3,300-year-old ship come alive, and then looking down and seeing what it looked like on the seabed.

18:42.545 --> 18:46.951
And then they go into the next room, where actually he was able to get a volunteer.

18:47.391 --> 18:53.038
The woman in charge of exhibiting for the Metropolitan Museum of Art came over to make the display cases, put things in it.

18:53.018 --> 18:57.426
And then you see the actual objects, the actual gold jewelry, the actual things.

18:57.706 --> 18:59.730
And we had that.

19:00.211 --> 19:13.153
And the very next day, and there was a meal that night for hundreds of people, and then the very next day we had cutting ribbons, our library building, our conservation laboratory, our computer center.

19:13.133 --> 19:18.205
And my house is right, I walked through a garden gate into my garden and my house is right next door.

19:18.807 --> 19:21.413
I hope the institute somehow will acquire my house after I die.

19:21.874 --> 19:29.472
I can't give it away, it belongs to my kids, but if they want to sell it, they'll sell it to the institute and make it a wonderful director's house since it's right there.

19:29.857 --> 19:34.643
Incidentally, our boundary in front of our, it's the ancient city wall of Halicarnassus.

19:34.984 --> 19:41.632
That's where Herodotus was born, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, the mausoleum of Halicarnassus, just down the street.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.995
Probably some of the stones for it are built into my house.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.920
As a brick collector, see, that gets my attention.

19:48.401 --> 19:49.783
Ah, yeah.

19:50.364 --> 19:56.151
Let's see, humorous moments, funny.

19:56.131 --> 19:58.108
We laugh our heads off.

19:58.128 --> 20:00.589
It's hard to think what makes you laugh.

20:01.278 --> 20:02.599
It's easy to remember bad things.

20:03.080 --> 20:06.963
We usually remember that bad things have a way of disappearing.

20:07.023 --> 20:14.389
That's why I do think, although it's hard at the moment, I do think the country will get over the bush-gore bitterness.

20:14.890 --> 20:17.572
Because, you know, when I think back, oh, wasn't it wonderful?

20:17.592 --> 20:22.216
And then somebody says, but don't you remember that was the year where you had the crazy commission and they wanted to stop your excavation?

20:22.316 --> 20:23.617
Oh, yeah, yeah, I forgot about that.

20:23.637 --> 20:26.160
Or that's the year that Vladi almost cut his hand off.

20:26.180 --> 20:27.301
Oh, yeah, yeah.

20:27.321 --> 20:30.103
Not hand, but cut through a couple of fingers on a compressor.

20:30.083 --> 20:31.365
Humorous moments.

20:33.047 --> 20:33.127
Oh.

20:39.254 --> 20:39.875
I didn't see it.

20:39.895 --> 20:40.716
I wish it had been filmed.

20:40.756 --> 20:43.279
Everyone there said it was the funniest thing they ever saw in their lives.

20:43.419 --> 20:49.686
One party night, as I say, we don't allow drinking through the week, but we'll have a party on a Thursday night because there's no dieting.

20:49.706 --> 20:55.213
And I won't say that we were drunk or anything like that, but everybody was having fun drinking wine or beer or whatever.

20:56.645 --> 21:02.000
And we had some sort of jazzy version of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

21:02.843 --> 21:10.705
And for reasons unknown, Robin Piercy, this very tall 6'6", ungainly English gentleman, and I,

21:11.714 --> 21:12.475
did a ballet.

21:13.956 --> 21:16.339
People said it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen.

21:16.399 --> 21:21.464
I mean, leaping into one another's arms and jetting, trying to do pirouettes and spinning.

21:21.544 --> 21:22.626
Is this recorded on film?

21:22.646 --> 21:23.186
It's not.

21:23.206 --> 21:23.547
It's not.

21:23.607 --> 21:26.570
Everyone that's seen it said it was the funniest thing they ever saw.

21:27.451 --> 21:29.573
I remember doing it, but I didn't think it was that funny.

21:29.613 --> 21:32.596
It was just, and we could never, you could never repeat something like that.

21:32.616 --> 21:35.359
It was just this inspiring moment.

21:39.743 --> 21:40.704
I'd have to think about that.

21:40.745 --> 22:01.016
I mean, there are people constantly doing little pranks, like now that they're computers, somebody got some sort of pin-up thing with all these scantily clad women and put the faces of a lot of the staff on it and printed it out in color and put it up on the bulletin board, which everybody laughed at, but... What about... Oh, I know.

22:01.056 --> 22:02.578
It's Sertilimana.

22:03.098 --> 22:08.011
where we had to bring all the fresh water out and just two 55 gallon oil drums twice a week for 30 people.

22:08.653 --> 22:11.199
In medical sciences you can't live on that little water, but we did.

22:12.924 --> 22:16.112
There was a brackish well at the other end of this natural harbor.

22:17.594 --> 22:22.461
And so the women of the camp, the wives, used to go over there.

22:22.481 --> 22:27.889
I'm trying not to be sexist because half of our divers are women, but they would go over and do laundry there.

22:27.909 --> 22:30.012
And sometimes some of us would go with them.

22:30.032 --> 22:35.620
And we found out that the greatest thing, we had these striped sheets, bed sheets, and

22:36.342 --> 22:45.914
So we'd get in the rowboat, and we'd hold these up, and we would sail back, and we would dry one, and we'd put it down, grab another, pick it up, wet sheets, and we would dry the laundry by using them as sails.

22:45.974 --> 22:53.003
And we actually, we would have races in these little rowboats with these, and we looked like Vikings with the striped sheets.

22:53.023 --> 22:54.385
That was, that was a lot of fun.

22:54.525 --> 22:55.286
That was a lot of fun.

22:55.866 --> 23:00.392
Are there any examples of Aggie spirit in Turkey?

23:08.708 --> 23:22.872
I mean, certainly we're all aware that we're from Texas A&M, and for example, I noticed that the National Geographic Explorer film, that in almost every scene I'm wearing my Texas A&M Nautical Archaeology sweatshirt, so very much so.

23:23.373 --> 23:34.952
Spirit, I think that we're all very conscious that we come from the best program in the world for what we do, and that is the Texas A&M program, so yeah.

23:34.932 --> 23:40.328
In hindsight, has the INA missed any opportunities?

23:41.191 --> 23:44.200
Are some things that might have happened that you now realize

23:44.973 --> 23:47.617
No, not, not, not on our own.

23:47.877 --> 24:02.478
Now, the reason that we had two Chinese students here for a year, no, for a term, and they were really nice, nice young men, um, was because the Chinese government sent them here to develop a joint program, uh, in nautical archaeology.

24:02.558 --> 24:05.301
I think they had a 13th century Chinese junk they wanted to excavate.

24:05.802 --> 24:09.988
And one is from the National Museum and one is, uh, was from their Department of Archaeology.

24:10.829 --> 24:12.111
Um, and

24:12.547 --> 24:14.500
One of them wanted to stay here and work on a master's degree.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.735
And I said, no, go home and then apply and come back.

24:16.755 --> 24:19.030
No, I'd like to stay and get a master's degree with you.

24:19.567 --> 24:26.717
And the week that they went home, one of them is from the Museum of Chinese History on Tiananmen Square was Tiananmen Square.

24:27.598 --> 24:31.283
And they wrote to me and they said, we can't work now with Americans.

24:32.205 --> 24:34.748
We have to work with the Japanese instead and we're really sorry.

24:35.129 --> 24:40.296
And I see one of them from time to time in international meetings and you see still dreams of working with us.

24:40.476 --> 24:43.060
And we're occasionally in touch by email.

24:43.040 --> 24:44.702
They used to come to my house.

24:45.564 --> 24:56.760
I used to do every other Friday night, I'd have my, back of my house is like an apartment, and it's my opera room, and I have about 70 operas on a laser disc, and they have a wonderful stereo system, big TV.

24:57.281 --> 25:01.487
And I used to invite students if they wanted to come, if they didn't bother me, to come and watch an opera.

25:01.467 --> 25:05.671
And here, these two Chinese students would come and watch Don Giovanni or Tosca or something.

25:06.131 --> 25:15.961
So one night, I really surprised them because I had ordered a classical Chinese opera, which to Westerners didn't mean anything, but they were laughing their heads off because it was a comic opera.

25:16.601 --> 25:19.184
And so they were nice kids.

25:19.264 --> 25:21.666
And so I'm sorry that that never came about.

25:22.046 --> 25:22.807
That wasn't our fault.

25:22.847 --> 25:27.351
It was due to the international relations which keep us right now from working in Syria.

25:27.391 --> 25:29.393
We have excellent friends and colleagues.

25:29.754 --> 25:31.255
Oh, we have a branch in Egypt now.

25:31.235 --> 25:36.901
That's one of our, two of our former students got married, set up.

25:37.722 --> 25:50.815
Any research opportunities that were missed that you, in hindsight, wish that INA could have worked on, might have worked on?

25:53.177 --> 25:53.457
No.

25:54.018 --> 25:57.141
No.

26:00.462 --> 26:08.557
No, and that's because I think that I've probably been too – when I was president, sometimes I'd get as almost in debt because I was too willing to say yes.

26:08.597 --> 26:12.224
I used to say if somebody said, you know, we have this wreck up in the Bering Sea, would you do it?

26:12.244 --> 26:14.167
I'd say yes, and then we're later back where to find the money.

26:14.488 --> 26:16.632
So I think we take advantage of every opportunity.

26:16.612 --> 26:17.293
All right.

26:17.333 --> 26:19.175
Now, I've just about run out of topics.

26:19.355 --> 26:21.097
What have we not touched on that we should have?

26:21.117 --> 26:23.039
I think we've really touched on everything.

26:23.419 --> 26:23.720
All right.

26:24.821 --> 26:35.893
Then the two or three things I can think of, let's make believe that you are now the consultant brought in to give advice to, at different levels.

26:36.313 --> 26:42.800
First, the advice to the leaders of the INA as to what it should aspire to do in the future.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.442
What advice would you give?

26:47.105 --> 26:51.816
I would say that the leaders should,

26:54.293 --> 27:08.250
keep INA in the forefront of archaeology by – our mission should be to look for and then choose from those we've found the most exciting archaeological sites underwater that – around the world.

27:09.351 --> 27:10.793
And to publish them as well.

27:10.833 --> 27:12.615
And we have a very good publication record.

27:12.655 --> 27:15.759
I mean, archaeology without publication is looting, of course.

27:16.320 --> 27:17.561
And so we're very pleased.

27:17.581 --> 27:20.605
But people don't realize that for every month we dive,

27:20.585 --> 27:26.714
We've now figured out a rule of thumb which holds true whether it's in the Caribbean or whether it's in Kenya or whether it's in the Mediterranean.

27:26.954 --> 27:32.482
For every month we dive we spend two years on research, library research and conservation, uh, and publication.

27:34.885 --> 27:41.074
The, uh, are there any things new that INA ought to start doing, or any new areas?

27:41.493 --> 28:00.500
Well, there was a push by Jack Kelly, this founder, to get us involved in deep water archaeology with Bob Ballard, who, because there is a theory that wrecks deep in the Black Sea may be perfectly preserved because the Black Sea beneath a certain depth is anaerobic or without oxygen.

28:01.341 --> 28:03.564
And Bob Ballard seems to be showing that is the case.

28:03.604 --> 28:09.272
In fact, it's shallower than was dreamed.

28:10.737 --> 28:12.199
Ballard and I are old friends.

28:12.279 --> 28:17.847
We roomed together the summer I formed INA and the summer he was getting his PhD.

28:18.508 --> 28:30.146
And he used to talk to me until 2 in the morning with the light out sometime in the room in this week-long government conference, US government conference on developing a program for man in the sea, about his dreams of using the Alvin and all that.

28:30.166 --> 28:33.150
And then he went on and became famous on the Titanic.

28:33.130 --> 28:36.060
and finding these living things in vents.

28:36.080 --> 28:39.913
I was talking to him about my dream of forming this institute, and it's become world famous now.

28:40.856 --> 28:45.773
Not the same thing Ballard has, but it's known in archaeological circles.

28:47.778 --> 28:57.548
Ballard wants to run his own show, and Jack felt that we could somehow go in as equals, and I didn't think so, and Jack just got off the board because he's so angry at me because he thought that.

28:57.848 --> 29:06.376
We do have Ina archaeologists working with him, but Ballard raises the millions of dollars he needs for this deep work, and it's terribly expensive, and I don't know how to find the money to do it, frankly.

29:07.137 --> 29:10.821
He's got such a name that he can raise three million dollars to buy a piece of equipment.

29:11.601 --> 29:16.266
I'd love to find three million dollars to endow the institute.

29:16.567 --> 29:20.892
Should INA do more work in freshwater areas?

29:21.914 --> 29:22.635
We're doing a lot.

29:22.695 --> 29:24.637
We still work in the Great Lakes and in rivers.

29:26.179 --> 29:34.029
Can you think of any kind of technology or anything else like that that may really be just on the horizon?

29:34.169 --> 29:39.115
The one thing that the world has the greatest problem at is finding wrecks.

29:39.095 --> 30:06.469
we can excavate a wreck now in diving depths and given enough money we excavate wrecks you know two miles deep uh because uh tommy thompson who is a treasure hunter you might say but but but an educated one he's an engineer uh has excavated the um the uh central america which was a very very rich ship carrying a payroll that sank in a storm miles off the coast of north carolina in the

30:06.449 --> 30:07.411
like a mildee.

30:07.991 --> 30:11.617
He spent millions to find it, but he's made millions because it was filled with bullion.

30:11.838 --> 30:12.959
It's from the Civil War period.

30:14.241 --> 30:21.613
But he's tried to do it carefully, and it shows that you can take objects one at a time and map them at depth, given enough money.

30:21.673 --> 30:29.065
But he's paying for it by, you know, the quarter billion dollars that he says is on the ship, and I think is a lot of gold bullion coming off.

30:29.045 --> 30:33.791
whereas we have to raise it for purely philanthropic gifts of, uh, for knowledge.

30:34.532 --> 30:37.577
And so, um, so to find Rick is the most important thing.

30:37.597 --> 30:48.271
And so I should tell you in that regard that, in fact, Jerome Hall, one of our former doctoral students, who is now president of the organization, is working with the woman who trained SEALs for the U.S.

30:48.311 --> 30:49.753
Navy to find things.

30:49.733 --> 30:55.899
And we think if you can train a seal to find a torpedo, maybe you can train a seal to recognize pottery and come back and tell you.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.123
So that's a reality we're working on.

30:59.143 --> 31:00.164
All right.

31:00.844 --> 31:13.137
Again, as a consultant, now you're advising the department, the college, the university about the INA and related areas.

31:13.177 --> 31:15.960
What advice would you give to the institutional leaders?

31:20.750 --> 31:27.099
Keep the mix as close as possible to what it is today.

31:27.140 --> 31:28.566
I think it's virtually perfect.
