WEBVTT

00:02.528 --> 00:18.478
here when the Williams presidency John Calhoun vice presidency we're just getting started yeah as a matter of fact I forgot to mention I also met I mean I was impressed I got to meet everybody I met when already

00:18.458 --> 00:20.721
And I also met John Calhoun briefly.

00:20.841 --> 00:23.525
I mean, it was just 15 minutes or something like that.

00:23.665 --> 00:27.550
But I remember Dean Renardi.

00:27.570 --> 00:28.612
He was particularly funny.

00:30.454 --> 00:39.367
He said, well, just remember that if you want to get ahead here, he said the thing to do is make sure you don't have chaos in the classroom.

00:40.108 --> 00:43.993
But he said the main thing is going to be that you're going to have to publish like hell.

00:44.615 --> 00:46.679
And I said, well, that's not a real problem.

00:47.240 --> 00:53.131
But I'll never forget, he said, as long as there's not chaos in the classroom, that's okay.

00:53.151 --> 00:56.438
Not a great innovator for teaching.

00:56.638 --> 00:58.682
So you got here in August of 71.

00:59.484 --> 01:00.546
Yes, August of 71.

01:00.726 --> 01:05.475
I will not ask any more, but what was the beginning salary?

01:05.573 --> 01:07.116
Oh, beginning salary was $14,000.

01:07.256 --> 01:15.733
And I was making, let's see, I was making $12,000 at Washington State.

01:16.194 --> 01:21.805
And actually, it wasn't a whole lot of an improvement because I had to pay for my moving down here.

01:21.865 --> 01:24.992
Washington State had paid to move me to Washington State.

01:25.072 --> 01:25.152
Ooh.

01:25.503 --> 01:28.046
But I had to pay to come down here.

01:28.827 --> 01:31.431
So anyway, but that was in 1971.

01:32.792 --> 01:47.511
And while between the spring when I had accepted the position and the fall, I had, at Bob Skorbonik's request, actually written a course description for a new course.

01:47.491 --> 01:51.538
called Introduction to Anthropology.

01:52.440 --> 01:58.632
And when I arrived here in the fall of 1971, I taught two sections of Introduction to Anthropology.

01:58.992 --> 02:01.357
And there were about 60 students in each section.

02:01.958 --> 02:05.905
And those were the first courses to actually be taught on the Texas A&M campus

02:06.847 --> 02:07.728
in anthropology.

02:07.868 --> 02:11.772
Was there even a course prefix anthro?

02:12.553 --> 02:13.113
Actually, it was.

02:13.133 --> 02:13.994
It was A-N-T-H.

02:14.194 --> 02:14.655
Oh, it was?

02:14.995 --> 02:15.095
Okay.

02:15.115 --> 02:15.976
They started out that way.

02:16.737 --> 02:25.726
But I discovered shortly after I arrived here that there was already another A-N-T-H course being offered and had been taught for about four years.

02:26.467 --> 02:33.394
And this was a course in physical anthropology that was being taught by Sidney O. Brown in the Department of

02:33.374 --> 02:35.598
biology, I guess it was.

02:37.662 --> 02:39.606
Sidney Brown was a crusty old guy.

02:39.646 --> 02:50.286
He was a retired naval captain who had served in the Second World War, had been all over the world, and considered himself

02:50.266 --> 02:54.311
I don't know if he had a PhD or not, but he was really a biologist.

02:54.952 --> 02:57.796
But he considered himself an authority on the races of man.

02:59.398 --> 03:07.329
And his course, although I never took it, some of the students that took my course had taken his course, and so I quizzed them about it.

03:08.350 --> 03:14.639
But his final exam consisted of a hundred slides that he would show on the board.

03:14.659 --> 03:19.345
And the students would have to name the race.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.805
of each of the hundred slides.

03:23.689 --> 03:37.958
Sidney Brown was a great believer in a book that was published by Carlton Kuhn in 1957 called The Races of Mankind, in which Kuhn identified more than 50 different racial types of humans

03:37.938 --> 03:42.445
Today, of course, we don't even believe that races exist.

03:42.565 --> 03:47.552
There are different phenotypes, as they're called, but they're all one race.

03:47.572 --> 03:59.490
It's interesting that in the anthropology department right now, we have a set of cast, plaster cast of these 53 races, which was used here by Sidney Brown

03:59.470 --> 04:03.118
back in the late 60s and early 70s.

04:03.218 --> 04:16.566
Anyway, so Sidney Brown taught this course and we objected because we said it was really against anthropology practice because by that time anthropologists had disavowed the whole thing of race.

04:17.127 --> 04:18.390
But nevertheless,

04:18.370 --> 04:23.716
The agreement was that until he retired, he had exclusive right to teach that course.

04:23.917 --> 04:27.220
And when he retired, then anthropology would get that course.

04:27.240 --> 04:31.385
And he did retire a few years later, and we did get the course.

04:31.405 --> 04:35.670
Even today, that course is still cross-listed with biology.

04:36.031 --> 04:38.414
So it is remaining a cross-listed course.

04:38.434 --> 04:42.218
So that first semester, fall of 71,

04:42.535 --> 04:44.918
You had two sections of anthropology.

04:44.938 --> 04:46.199
Did you have any other teaching?

04:46.760 --> 04:47.140
No.

04:47.160 --> 04:50.003
There was two sections of about 60 students each, and that was it.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.227
And in the spring, I taught the same thing again.

04:54.668 --> 05:10.365
And during that first year, at the time, we were located in the agronomy building way down here, which is actually right across from where we are now, down near the old heap.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.696
a cattle showing place.

05:12.716 --> 05:21.081
But anyway, in that first year, the reason I only had a two course load was my job was to begin adding courses.

05:21.179 --> 05:23.963
And I began writing up new course descriptions.

05:24.063 --> 05:43.891
In fact, in the fall of 1971 and early 1972, I wrote new courses for cultural anthropology, for introduction to North American Indians, introduction to peoples and cultures of the world, North American archaeology, introduction to archaeology.

05:44.772 --> 05:49.819
So I wrote four or five courses, which we got through the coordinating board and approved.

05:49.799 --> 05:54.812
so that we could begin in the fall of 1972 teaching some more courses.

05:55.574 --> 06:03.876
I was also charged with going out and finding a second anthropologist, and I went to the University of Texas and found a friend of mine by the name of Harry Shaffer,

06:04.514 --> 06:05.956
who was an archaeologist.

06:05.996 --> 06:07.457
Now, why hire an archaeologist?

06:07.557 --> 06:16.587
Because the University of Texas at Austin was very strong in cultural anthropology and linguistics and folklore, really, at that time.

06:17.088 --> 06:19.310
But they were very understaffed.

06:19.351 --> 06:21.393
In fact, they only had one archaeologist.

06:21.993 --> 06:29.041
So I thought that the best way for us to compete successfully with the University of Texas was to build a strong archaeology department.

06:29.101 --> 06:31.144
So I started off with Dr. Shaffer.

06:31.364 --> 06:34.167
And he came over in the fall of 1972.

06:34.147 --> 06:40.135
And it's the same time we moved to Bolton Hall from the Agronomy Building, so we're now moved to Bolton Hall.

06:42.959 --> 06:50.410
In 1972 to 1973, we began offering a lot of these other courses.

06:50.650 --> 06:56.138
Harry and I both taught this, you know, we taught North American Indians, we taught cultural anthropology,

06:56.860 --> 07:02.040
North American archaeology, archaeology, introduction anthropology, we were just, you know, a jack of all trades.

07:02.301 --> 07:07.360
And we began looking for a new anthropologist, this time a cultural anthropologist,

07:08.065 --> 07:14.134
And we hired a guy by the name of Norman Thomas from Northern New Mexico University.

07:14.254 --> 07:17.259
Norman Thomas worked in Mesoamerica.

07:17.619 --> 07:18.521
Where did he do his PhD?

07:18.541 --> 07:19.422
Do you remember?

07:19.442 --> 07:19.802
Berkeley.

07:20.343 --> 07:21.285
He got his PhD at Berkeley.

07:22.306 --> 07:24.830
Harry had gotten his PhD at the University of Texas at Austin.

07:26.232 --> 07:27.854
But he had good background.

07:27.895 --> 07:29.557
He worked with the good people.

07:30.078 --> 07:36.267
Foster was a very prominent anthropologist at Berkeley.

07:36.972 --> 07:46.726
The reason we hired Norman Thomas was that he was a bibliophile, and he loved to work with library books.

07:47.527 --> 08:00.145
And after looking at our library holdings at that time and seeing that they were severely delinquent in the field of anthropology, I thought, in fact, I told Dr. Thomas that if we hired him, his primary job would be to build us a library

08:00.125 --> 08:04.632
collection and anthropology, and that's precisely what he did during his career here.

08:05.053 --> 08:07.717
What did the, what role did the library do?

08:07.837 --> 08:10.641
Where did you get the funding for them?

08:10.661 --> 08:12.264
Well, this was always a problem.

08:12.544 --> 08:14.066
I mean, we... For the library?

08:14.147 --> 08:16.310
Yeah, it was always a problem for the library and for us.

08:16.510 --> 08:20.596
I mean, we continued to plead for more and more funding.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.079
At first, it varied.

08:22.139 --> 08:24.883
Some years we got quite a big chunk, and some years we didn't.

08:25.268 --> 08:28.053
Dave Maxwell did what he could.

08:28.775 --> 08:30.338
The library, of course, was expanding.

08:30.378 --> 08:35.968
The university was expanding at record speed, and so there was a tremendous demand on the library from many different fields.

08:36.028 --> 08:38.272
So it's not that we felt left out.

08:38.453 --> 08:43.362
It's just that we were trying to get as big a piece of the pie as we could.

08:43.831 --> 08:49.618
And part of the problem was that we had to turn in the names of the books that we wanted.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.883
And this took some, you know, it took some time.

08:52.923 --> 08:57.048
You had to fill out the forms and you had to go find which ones were missing and which ones weren't.

08:57.088 --> 08:58.790
So it did take a lot of time.

08:58.870 --> 09:00.833
So this is why Norman was hired.

09:01.934 --> 09:09.804
He wasn't as good a scholar as we might have wanted, but he served us well in this area.

09:10.365 --> 09:12.808
And those first few years,

09:13.177 --> 09:20.445
Who outside the department deserves the most credit for being supportive of the growth and development of anthropology?

09:20.465 --> 09:26.392
I'd have to say David Maxwell, really, Maxwell more than anybody else was very good.

09:27.113 --> 09:32.279
Jack Williams, I don't know what direct role he played, although he was always very congenial.

09:32.660 --> 09:33.601
It was very interesting.

09:33.961 --> 09:40.028
One of the things I discovered very early on is his wife's maiden name was Bryant.

09:40.008 --> 09:44.515
And so every time we would see them, we were always buddy-buddy.

09:44.836 --> 09:52.288
And I remember talking to her many times about mutual possible relatives and things like that.

09:52.429 --> 09:57.657
But anyway, I really admired Dr. Williams and hated to see him leave when he did.

09:57.697 --> 10:05.290
And during those early years, were you all identified as a section or a what?

10:05.894 --> 10:11.042
Well, up until 1983, we were just part of sociology.

10:12.284 --> 10:17.772
Right, but from the very first, was the title of the department listed as sociology and?

10:18.112 --> 10:19.574
Yes, yes.

10:20.015 --> 10:25.303
When I, actually, when it was created in 1969,

10:25.283 --> 10:29.248
It was created as the Department of Sociology and Anthropology.

10:30.329 --> 10:34.675
And so it remained that for some years.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.778
And I'll get to that in a minute.

10:36.818 --> 10:42.304
Anyway, so 1972, 1973, we hired Norman Thomas.

10:42.365 --> 10:43.566
We taught a number of courses.

10:44.247 --> 10:50.054
And also, this was the first year that we established something called the Cultural Resource Laboratory.

10:50.835 --> 10:53.839
The Cultural Resource Laboratory was a...

10:54.477 --> 11:01.180
Research arm of the program or group really consisted of Harry and me.

11:01.632 --> 11:06.638
And what we did was go out and compete for contracts, archaeological contracts.

11:06.698 --> 11:20.074
Now what happens is the federal government under the antiquities law is required to do salvage work of sites that are going to be destroyed or impaired anyway by federal or state activities.

11:21.515 --> 11:26.241
So when they identify these areas, people bid for them.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.804
And so we started bidding for these.

11:28.784 --> 11:33.993
And we did this under the rubric of the Cultural Resource Laboratory.

11:34.053 --> 11:35.435
So we began to build that up.

11:35.496 --> 11:41.386
We hired, began hiring some staff archaeologists, not faculty, but staff archaeologists to help us go out.

11:41.426 --> 11:45.593
And we started small, but it began to mushroom and turn into something pretty big.

11:45.853 --> 11:53.847
Which was the, what was a kind of a big step first of those contracts that really mattered?

11:54.670 --> 12:06.188
We got a couple of little ones and then in, let's see, I was trying to remember, we started in 1972 and we were writing everything that came along we started writing requests for.

12:06.248 --> 12:15.602
And this takes quite a bit of time because you have to write, you have to go out and research the area, you have to decide what you're going to do, how to do it, you have to program this thing out.

12:15.662 --> 12:18.366
It's like writing an NSF grant.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.448
It's not something that's really easy to do.

12:20.508 --> 12:21.369
It takes a lot of time.

12:21.389 --> 12:26.756
But anyway, we were frantically writing these things with the idea that if we wrote enough of them, we'd get one.

12:27.396 --> 12:29.419
You know, put enough pokers in the fire, one of them gets hot.

12:30.260 --> 12:34.685
Well, in 1972 and early 1973, we wrote a number of these.

12:34.965 --> 12:44.556
And in the spring of 1973, no, spring of 1974,

12:45.734 --> 12:48.658
Yeah, spring of 1974, we got five.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.467
Five of these that we had requested all hit.

12:54.487 --> 12:57.291
And it's one of these things where you don't really say no thank you.

12:58.012 --> 13:00.075
We were the winning bids.

13:01.057 --> 13:03.220
And these were five pretty good-sized contracts.

13:03.300 --> 13:09.109
I mean, at the time, they were like $50,000 or $60,000 a piece, which back in those days was a lot of money.

13:09.882 --> 13:15.009
We were frantically running around the state trying to find qualified staff members to help us.

13:16.090 --> 13:17.312
We were spread pretty thin.

13:17.372 --> 13:20.936
But, you know, somehow we managed to do it.

13:20.976 --> 13:23.740
And it was at this time we decided we needed another archaeologist.

13:24.100 --> 13:29.908
So I sent Harry, who was an archaeologist, out to try to find another archaeologist.

13:30.008 --> 13:33.072
I said, Harry, for God's sake, go find somebody you can work with.

13:33.355 --> 13:58.738
So he went to the Society for American Archaeology meetings in April, came back with glowing, well, you know, anyway, remarks about Dr. Bruce Dixon, who was working at the University of Tennessee at the time for, under a guy by the name of Richard Bass, anyway.

13:59.849 --> 14:00.830
So we hired Bruce.

14:01.051 --> 14:01.751
He came to visit.

14:02.032 --> 14:02.813
Everything looked great.

14:02.933 --> 14:03.433
We hired him.

14:04.234 --> 14:14.748
And he hadn't been here more than two months before he and Harry got into a big hoopla and wouldn't talk to each other anymore.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.730
And so I said, oh, my lord.

14:17.351 --> 14:23.038
I said, you know, what we really don't need right now is friction between the two archaeologists.

14:23.356 --> 14:33.417
I don't really know who was at fault, but nevertheless for many years they were sort of like opposing poles on a magnet.

14:34.156 --> 14:46.856
But anyway, Bruce did help us out with some of our contract work, but it made a real problem because Harry had a big chunk, Bruce had a little chunk, and the same people that worked for Harry wouldn't work for Bruce, and wouldn't work for Bruce, wouldn't work.

14:46.876 --> 14:47.577
Ah, it was a big mess.

14:48.198 --> 14:51.383
But anyway, we nevertheless managed to plot on.

14:52.125 --> 14:59.877
All right, so in those early years, you're inferring to me that there wasn't one grant

14:59.857 --> 15:04.691
one project that really did something, it was the accumulation of a bunch.

15:06.155 --> 15:14.659
What happened was that first, you know, we got a couple little ones, like, you know, five, ten thousand dollar jobs, which we could complete in a short period of time.

15:14.960 --> 15:17.444
And we had been writing all these big ones, hoping to get one.

15:17.804 --> 15:18.825
But then we got five.

15:19.607 --> 15:23.873
And so, really, for a couple years there, we were spread very, very thin.

15:24.213 --> 15:25.615
Geographically, where were they?

15:26.456 --> 15:30.622
Most of them were, well, one was at Fort Richardson, which was up near Wichita Falls.

15:30.883 --> 15:35.509
That was an old pre-Civil War Army base.

15:35.950 --> 15:36.090
Mm-hmm.

15:36.070 --> 15:37.713
and they wanted that reconstructed.

15:38.494 --> 15:39.596
We found out a lot about it.

15:39.636 --> 15:43.442
For one thing, the original drawings and survey were completely wrong.

15:43.923 --> 16:00.390
I don't know where in the world they got the data, but the archaeology that we found did not match the maps that were drawn back in 1840s or 18, I guess it was 1850s, 1850s, shortly after Texas became a state, before the Civil War.

16:00.370 --> 16:03.615
And even after the Civil War, they went back and occupied it again.

16:03.675 --> 16:18.337
We also worked in San Gabriel, which was over near Georgetown, and Williamson County, over Williams County over there, and also up in near Milam.

16:18.357 --> 16:21.381
These were a lot of Corps of Engineers projects.

16:21.401 --> 16:22.102
All in Texas?

16:22.122 --> 16:23.364
Yes, all in Texas, right.

16:23.384 --> 16:24.686
And they were all fairly close by.

16:25.407 --> 16:28.572
And this involved both faculty and students?

16:29.142 --> 16:31.765
Well, you know, we still only had an undergraduate program.

16:32.106 --> 16:37.913
And yes, we were hiring a few undergraduates to go out as shovel bums, people to dig and so forth.

16:38.394 --> 16:39.755
But we didn't have a graduate program.

16:40.596 --> 16:44.081
And so most of the expertise we had to hire from outside.

16:44.121 --> 16:52.191
We were hiring mainly people from the University of Texas, Texas Tech, some people from Louisiana, and just literally anybody we could find.

16:53.292 --> 16:55.555
When did you all get hired?

16:55.535 --> 16:58.781
undergraduate major approved, do you remember?

16:59.101 --> 17:00.023
The next year in 1975.

17:00.043 --> 17:05.252
1974 was a busy year on top of all of this stuff.

17:05.913 --> 17:14.207
We also were writing requests to the coordinating board to get a bachelor's in anthropology, which we did get the following year in 1975.

17:14.828 --> 17:21.880
Up until that time, generalize about the students that took the courses in anthropology.

17:21.860 --> 17:23.022
What was their major?

17:23.062 --> 17:24.244
What was their background?

17:24.264 --> 17:25.385
What were their career goals?

17:26.287 --> 17:35.601
Well, that's very interesting because in the very beginning, anthropology was not included as a degree requirement on any degree at Texas A&M University.

17:36.121 --> 17:39.627
And since we did not have an anthropology degree, we had nothing.

17:40.328 --> 17:45.235
So every student that took anthropology had to take it as an open elective.

17:45.215 --> 17:49.664
A lot of programs were fairly restrictive on how many of these open elective students could take.

17:49.744 --> 17:54.655
So there really wasn't a large group of students from which to choose.

17:54.715 --> 17:56.078
This was before the business school.

17:56.959 --> 18:05.116
Most of the students we got were from other majors in liberal arts, people who were in sociology or psychology or economics or something like that.

18:05.197 --> 18:06.379
There were a few engineers.

18:06.764 --> 18:13.915
a few people from agriculture, but we had a really hard time getting those classes very large.

18:13.955 --> 18:20.666
I mean, most of the classes were 30, 40, 50, which in retrospect was a dream compared to what we're doing now.

18:21.868 --> 18:32.805
One of the things we did to try to stir up more business was that we started, probably by 1973, we started these monthly movies.

18:32.785 --> 18:40.177
We would rent these 16-millimeter movies of, well, what punk people would call bizarre stuff.

18:40.337 --> 18:46.768
One of them was called Dead Birds, another one was called The Hunt, and things like this, and show them.

18:48.290 --> 18:57.325
Over, we showed them in Zachary, and we showed them in the MSC, and we would put flyers all over campus telling people, free movies, see?

18:57.524 --> 19:05.736
And we got quite a good reception of people coming to these things, and I suspect some of these people probably ended up taking our courses.

19:05.817 --> 19:18.536
But in the early days, before the core curriculum or anything like that, or before we had a major, it was a real fight to get people, first of all, to even recognize what anthropology was, or to even try taking the courses.

19:18.556 --> 19:20.038
So, yes, it was.

19:20.058 --> 19:22.722
Now, were they juniors and seniors by and large?

19:24.254 --> 19:31.264
That's hard to, it's hard to remember whether they were primarily juniors or seniors or freshmen.

19:32.065 --> 19:34.368
I think there was a fairly good smattering of.

19:34.568 --> 19:39.155
What about male, female?

19:39.876 --> 19:46.465
I do remember that when I first got here in 1971, there weren't that many females on the campus.

19:46.883 --> 19:50.627
But I remember that we had a fairly good selection of them, yes.

19:50.747 --> 19:55.492
I would say that the females have always been more prone towards anthropology probably than males.

19:56.173 --> 20:05.823
Do you remember any comments of other faculty members and or deans or anything characterizing anthropology in those early years?

20:07.204 --> 20:08.105
Well, yes.

20:11.909 --> 20:13.911
I remember and I can't remember who it was.

20:13.971 --> 20:15.473
There was some administrator.

20:16.347 --> 20:30.576
who when I told him that I was teaching anthropology said oh yeah that's that subject is all about monkeys isn't it I don't remember the administrator but it was some administrator okay the other thing I do remember is

20:31.484 --> 20:45.064
A couple years later, after we actually had a degree, about 1976, I guess it was, we had hired a physical anthropologist by the name of Ordon Orian, who had worked with Richard Leakey in Africa.

20:46.286 --> 20:56.361
And he was doing some primate work with some primates down in San Antonio at the Primate Center.

20:57.337 --> 21:05.027
And he had this chimpanzee, and there was a picture of him holding this chimpanzee that appeared in the front page of the New York Times or something.

21:06.148 --> 21:10.014
And Oyen had a full beard and a mustache, you know.

21:10.034 --> 21:13.839
I mean, he looked sort of almost like a, well, you know, like a caveman.

21:14.339 --> 21:18.364
And he's holding this primate, and he was talking about evolution.

21:19.286 --> 21:27.276
And I remember Jack Williams was still president, and they, an alumni, I don't remember who,

21:27.577 --> 21:39.544
had written this letter to the President requesting that he immediately fire this person because, you know, yes, because he had a beard,

21:39.828 --> 21:48.381
and because he was espousing on evolution and was disgracing A&M by being photographed with a chimpanzee.

21:48.401 --> 21:51.967
You know, it was going to make A&M look like a monkey school.

21:53.128 --> 22:00.279
Well, William sent the letter on to me and said, just thought you might be interested in this.

22:01.822 --> 22:05.848
Nothing ever came of it, of course, but I always thought that was rather humorous.

22:05.888 --> 22:07.270
But that was in the early days.

22:07.520 --> 22:14.982
Did the formal proposal for a major run into any snags along the way?

22:15.485 --> 22:16.626
Not to my recollection.

22:17.167 --> 22:18.908
We applied for that in 1974.

22:19.188 --> 22:23.412
As far as I know, it went right through the curriculum committee lickety-split.

22:23.532 --> 22:28.997
By 1975, in the fall of 75, we could actually offer majors in anthropology.

22:29.017 --> 22:31.139
Did it officially have to go to the coordinating board?

22:31.259 --> 22:32.060
Yes, it did.

22:32.340 --> 22:33.982
And no snags there, as far as you know?

22:34.002 --> 22:37.245
As far as I remember, the BA went through really quickly.

22:37.785 --> 22:45.492
And then in the fall of 1976, I guess it was,

22:45.472 --> 22:58.892
Let's see, shortly after we had, probably 1976, I'm trying to look down here, we hired more people.

22:58.912 --> 23:13.453
I guess it was in the fall, it was either the fall of, I think it was the fall of 75 when we may have gotten a BA, but I really think it was the fall of 76, fall of 75 or 76.

23:14.446 --> 23:39.205
What happened was Dr. Kopp, Jim Kopp, who was the new head of sociology COPP ran into some severe financial problems and by the end of the fiscal year he was running a severe deficit in sociology and anthropology.

23:39.353 --> 23:56.852
And so his solution for balancing the budget was to tap what resource funding he could find that was being used by individuals within the department, including a lot of our funds which were being used for contract archaeology.

23:57.813 --> 24:01.217
And so he tapped some of these accounts to balance his books.

24:02.118 --> 24:05.402
And when I protested, he basically said, well, I'm the department head.

24:05.482 --> 24:06.643
I have the right to do that.

24:07.045 --> 24:12.053
So I went to Maxwell and said, you know, this is not fair.

24:12.093 --> 24:15.338
We want out.

24:16.139 --> 24:20.926
So Maxwell agreed, and he then made us a separate program.

24:21.607 --> 24:23.790
And this was in the fall, I think, of 1976.

24:24.231 --> 24:28.277
We became a separate program within the department

24:28.257 --> 24:30.721
sociology and anthropology.

24:33.065 --> 24:38.454
I was appointed as a program head and some very interesting things happened.

24:39.075 --> 24:44.644
First of all there was no increase in salary because I wasn't really a head.

24:44.965 --> 24:47.008
I was a program head but not a department head.

24:47.883 --> 24:54.558
And the second thing was that I couldn't sit on the executive council because I was a program head, not a department head.

24:55.140 --> 25:02.196
So I had a lot of the responsibilities of a department head without any of the remunerations that generally go with it.

25:02.564 --> 25:07.348
We had a separate budget that was within sociology, but sociology couldn't spend our money.

25:07.949 --> 25:09.811
So we were answerable to our own budget.

25:09.951 --> 25:18.959
And once we had our own budget, starting in 1976, then we were happier anyway.

25:18.979 --> 25:27.326
Even though we were still in sociology, and even though sociology still controlled a lot of what we did and so forth, at least we had physical control.

25:27.346 --> 25:32.571
When you have physical control, you have authority.

25:32.551 --> 25:39.119
Compared to sociology, you all were doing reasonably well in bringing in money on your own, weren't you?

25:39.339 --> 25:40.300
We were actually doing better.

25:40.641 --> 25:41.041
That's right.

25:41.061 --> 25:41.301
Yes.

25:42.623 --> 25:50.813
The contract program, which Harry and I started in 1972, really blossomed and took off after we got those five big grants.

25:51.333 --> 25:53.996
We then had quite a big staff.

25:54.116 --> 25:56.259
We had more people to help write more of these things.

25:56.719 --> 25:59.723
We were beginning to gain a reputation of doing good work.

25:59.703 --> 26:03.698
And so, yes, it began to mushroom and we began to get more.

26:03.718 --> 26:10.101
1976, we got a large NSF grant of over $100,000, which at that time was a lot.

26:10.300 --> 26:22.440
to go out and do the paleoethnobotanical study and paleoarchaeological study of Heinz Cave, which was a big cave out in West Texas out in the Amnistad Reservoir.

26:23.322 --> 26:31.115
It was a continuation of what had been done when I was a graduate student when Dr. Jelks had gotten that grant.

26:31.676 --> 26:32.477
This was

26:32.457 --> 26:36.041
What we wanted to do was go out and do a site correctly.

26:36.101 --> 26:38.023
We wanted to go out and look at the archaeology.

26:38.063 --> 26:39.025
We wanted to look at the botany.

26:39.045 --> 26:41.087
We wanted to look at the animal fauna.

26:41.107 --> 26:43.830
We wanted to look at the skeletal remains and the whole works.

26:44.691 --> 26:48.395
And so this started in 1976 and went for a couple of years.

26:48.435 --> 26:52.960
And all of this kind of mushroomed.

26:53.121 --> 26:55.143
We were doing so well with our contract work.

26:55.203 --> 26:56.384
We got the big NSF grant.

26:57.566 --> 27:02.211
We really got, it's one of these cases where we're running so fast that we stumble.

27:02.461 --> 27:04.507
There was too much going on.

27:04.567 --> 27:05.991
There were too many things happening.

27:07.575 --> 27:14.614
Harry was getting spread too thin because he was trying to run the contract program where he was working on the NSF grant trying to teach courses and so forth.

27:15.438 --> 27:35.151
So I decided as the department or program head, I decided that for Harry's good, I had to relieve him of that responsibility and we had to hire somebody to actually head up the cultural resource laboratory whose primary job would be to do that and that's it.

27:35.941 --> 27:38.787
I don't think Harry ever forgave me for that.

27:40.772 --> 27:42.916
But I really don't think it could have gone on the way it was.

27:44.740 --> 27:54.321
We were beginning to run into fiscal troubles as well because so many different accounts that we were having a hard time keeping track of what was being spent.

27:54.301 --> 28:03.887
So we hired Irv Garrison from the University of Missouri to come down and be the new head of the contract program.

28:03.927 --> 28:09.542
This was in 1970, about 77, 78, around in there.

28:09.522 --> 28:13.810
probably 76, 77, right around the middle.

28:14.030 --> 28:15.913
And he came down and headed up the contract program.

28:16.134 --> 28:31.902
And shortly after he got here, he got a sizable grant to excavate the CSA Georgia, which was a Confederate gunboat, an ironclad, that had been scuttled in the Savannah Harbor.

28:33.265 --> 28:37.251
and was an obstacle to navigation.

28:37.831 --> 28:42.378
So the Corps of Engineers hired Garrison to excavate it.

28:43.119 --> 28:46.143
And this was really our first adventure into underwater archaeology.

28:50.289 --> 28:57.619
Now, a lot of this was all going on at the same time because when we got into doing this kind of work,

28:58.949 --> 29:11.682
A guy by the name of Carl Clausen, who was the state archaeologist, state underwater archaeologist at the time, and had been excavating some ships off the coast of Padre Island.

29:12.623 --> 29:18.089
These were a series of five ships that had sunk in 1555, 1556.

29:18.990 --> 29:27.859
Anyway, he came over to talk to us one day, and he said, hey, Texas A&M would be a wonderful place to start a program in nautical archaeology.

29:28.058 --> 29:29.400
Of course, he was looking for a job.

29:30.561 --> 29:35.067
And so we had Garrison here, and we said, well, gee, that's not like a good idea.

29:35.167 --> 29:39.532
So I asked him, I said, well, if we were going to do this, who should we get?

29:39.572 --> 29:45.960
And he said, well, the primary leader in underwater archaeology is Dr. George Bass of the University of Pennsylvania.

29:46.841 --> 29:48.163
And why don't you get him?

29:48.723 --> 29:51.887
So, hey, I said, do you know him?

29:51.907 --> 29:53.670
And Carl said, yeah, I've met him a couple of times.

29:53.690 --> 29:55.652
He said, I'll give him a call and tell him you're going to call him.

29:56.290 --> 30:03.407
So in 1977, I picked up the phone one day and called George Bass and said, Hi, George, this is Vaughn Bryant, you know, Texas A&M.

30:03.467 --> 30:08.158
And he was a little bit hesitant, very guarded at first.

30:08.178 --> 30:10.924
I mean, you know, out of the clear blue and so forth.

30:11.461 --> 30:17.033
I had gained permission from Dean Maxwell to at least investigate the possibilities of this.

30:17.954 --> 30:20.620
And so we began investigating the possibilities.

30:20.680 --> 30:26.432
And as we moved into this further and further, John Calhoun became very interested in it.

30:27.863 --> 30:31.248
And shortly thereafter, George came down to campus.

30:32.009 --> 30:51.778
And one of the things that I always sort of see as sort of a slap in the face, really, in a way, was that when George Bass landed at the airport, shortly after he landed, he was whisked off to see George Calhoun and Dean Maxwell and Wernarty and some of the other people.

30:52.214 --> 30:55.986
And I was completely left out and cold.

30:56.006 --> 31:02.427
I was not included in any of the negotiations or not included or even asked about anything.

31:03.082 --> 31:07.011
And the next thing I knew, it was all signed, sealed, and delivered.

31:08.273 --> 31:20.200
The American Institute of Nautical Archaeology, which George was the head of, a private foundation, was going to move their headquarters from Philadelphia to Texas A&M University.

31:20.481 --> 31:22.525
They were going to hire George.
