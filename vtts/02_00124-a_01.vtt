WEBVTT

00:02.123 --> 00:07.491
And we're sitting out on the back porch of the new 
house, John and Maridel Coldis. And I'm hoping

00:07.671 --> 00:10.415
that this machine is working as it should.

00:14.601 --> 00:17.505
See, October 21st, visiting with John Coldis. As a 
beginner, would you summarize, make believe that

00:19.227 --> 00:29.582
the person who might read or hear this would not 
know your background before you came to A&M

00:19.227 --> 00:29.582
University? Give us a brief biographical summary 
of your experience before coming to A&M.

00:40.309 --> 00:46.617
Okay.

00:46.637 --> 00:47.558
Ready? Yeah. I'm originally from Gary, Indiana. 
My dad came from Hungary. My mom's parents came

00:53.765 --> 00:57.730
from Hungary. They eventually came to Gary, 
Indiana because of the steel mills, and it

00:59.853 --> 01:17.391
provided an opportunity for Europeans who 
couldn't speak English

00:59.853 --> 01:17.391
to get a job and to make a living. Grew up in Gary. 
Went to the Gary, Indiana High School schools,

01:18.432 --> 01:26.980
specifically the Wallace High School. Graduated 
in 1940. I participated in athletics, football,

01:30.127 --> 01:36.794
basketball, and baseball. I wanted to go to 
college, couldn't afford to do so. Family

01:40.758 --> 01:42.159
couldn't afford to send me. I went to work in the 
steel mills to make some money. My high school

01:45.743 --> 02:00.117
coaches told me that they would help and look 
around and see if they could find an opportunity

01:45.743 --> 02:00.117
for me to walk on someplace and maybe earn a 
scholarship, an athletic

01:45.743 --> 02:00.117
scholarship. Had the opportunity to go to 
Arkansas State University, did so. Eventually,

02:05.124 --> 02:12.493
after a month or so, got a full scholarship in 
football. Played football, baseball for four

02:12.513 --> 02:20.903
years, basketball one

02:12.513 --> 02:20.903
year. Had a wonderful time at Arkansas State. 
Majored in broad field science. in education, and

02:29.611 --> 02:36.217
in history.

02:37.519 --> 02:55.416
While I was in college, I participated in the ROTC 
program, and so upon graduation from college, I

02:37.519 --> 02:55.416
received a commission from the U.S. Army, Field 
Artillery, and in August of 1953, My orders were to

02:55.632 --> 02:59.015
report for two years of military service. 
Fortunately, the Korean War ended in July of 1953,

03:00.237 --> 03:10.647
and it was peacetime when I went in. I really wanted 
to travel overseas. As it turned out, I was

03:12.790 --> 03:17.495
stationed in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which 
is a beautiful place. Enjoyed all of my time. I was

03:20.337 --> 03:24.762
in the 4th Field Artillery Battalion, a 155 gun 
outfit. It was an interesting period of time. Got

03:30.442 --> 03:39.496
out of the service in 1955, started my teaching 
career in junior high at Blytheville, Arkansas.

03:39.516 --> 03:48.429
Had an opportunity to go to the University of 
Toledo as a sports information person for my

03:39.516 --> 03:48.429
former football coach, Frost England. I turned 
the job down because I wanted to do some coaching

03:48.449 --> 03:51.994
when I was younger. The interesting thing was that 
the salaries were not too dissimilar at a

03:53.513 --> 04:00.179
university and a junior high coaching job. 
Coached for four years in Blytheville, Arkansas.

04:04.042 --> 04:04.883
Enjoyed what I did. Two years in junior high, two 
years in high school. I left Blytheville in 1959

04:08.626 --> 04:23.098
and joined the staff of Bum Phillips out at 
Amarillo High School, Amarillo Golden

04:08.626 --> 04:23.098
Sandstone, and was the assistant football coach, 
defensive backs, and was the head baseball coach

04:23.450 --> 04:26.255
from 59 through 61. When I got out of the service, I 
started my graduate work in the summer of 1956 at

04:27.837 --> 04:34.448
the University of Arkansas. Under the old GI Bill, 
you had seven years to use up everything you had

04:35.350 --> 04:40.018
coming. And so I had planned to go back full-time in 
61 to use all that up and get my doctoral degree by

04:40.038 --> 04:49.153
63. What I decided early on as a child that I wanted 
to teach, as I left the college campus, I thought

04:49.437 --> 05:00.672
that I really wanted to get back and teach on the 
college campus. So my orientation was in that

05:01.794 --> 05:04.778
direction. Took my first college job, East Texas 
State University, on the faculty there in 1963,

05:05.779 --> 05:15.352
June 1 of 1963. Enjoyed my time. I was in the health 
and physical education department at that time.

05:25.412 --> 05:30.617
And Justin Hawthorne, head of the department, 
super guy, took a very good period. At the time, Doe

05:30.637 --> 05:41.708
Rollins, who had been dean of men at Texas A&M, was 
the dean of men at East Texas State. And the

05:41.728 --> 05:48.655
football coach was a man by the name of Coach Sykes, 
who had coached Texas A&M. Those two used to tell me

05:49.006 --> 05:57.780
a lot of stories about Texas A&M and came back to 
make more sense years later when I came to A&M.

05:58.381 --> 05:59.603
Taught for four years. We had a new president that 
came in during that fourth year and he began to

06:00.405 --> 06:09.900
reorganize the administrative staff of the 
institution. And he was looking for a person who

06:10.235 --> 06:16.721
had an excellent student orientation to serve as 
the dean of students at that time. And he had gotten

06:16.741 --> 06:21.165
good word about me from a number of people. So he 
called me in one day, unbeknownst to me that he was

06:21.185 --> 06:24.247
thinking about it. And I was the chairman of the 
faculty committee on traffic safety and

06:25.328 --> 06:29.892
security. And I assumed that's what we were going 
to talk about. And he offered me the job as dean of

06:32.354 --> 06:35.797
students. Now, that's when? 1967. And so Meridel 
and I talked it over. The thing that we talked about

06:45.318 --> 06:49.683
was that I was happy doing what I was doing. I always 
wanted to be in the classroom. And I had never

06:53.387 --> 07:01.496
thought about the administration, career 
administration, straight line administration.

07:01.516 --> 07:07.082
So we talked, and we decided to give it a couple of 
years, and decided we would enjoy it, and we'd

07:01.516 --> 07:07.082
stay. And if we didn't, we'd go back to full-time 
teaching. As a part of that agreement, the

07:10.462 --> 07:15.630
president at that time was Whit Halliday.

07:18.314 --> 07:21.799
Part of that agreement was that I'd be allowed to 
continue in the classroom. So he was agreeable to

07:21.819 --> 07:25.525
that without any problem. And so I continued to 
teach all that period of time. So I served as VP.

07:32.916 --> 07:38.224
Well, they changed the title the next year from 
Dean of Students to Vice President. I served with

07:38.845 --> 07:43.892
under Dr. Whit Halliday for five of those years. 
Worked with Bob McDowell, who was vice president

07:44.793 --> 07:49.840
for finance. At the end of the fifth year, during 
that year, Whit's wife committed suicide. And so

07:58.291 --> 08:00.554
he decided to move. And Bob became president. And 
so I served one year with Bob as vice president.

08:06.622 --> 08:07.603
Hated to leave Bob. because he was a good man and 
wanted to help him with his presidency.

08:15.417 --> 08:21.683
The opportunities at Texas A&M, I thought, were 
too great to pass up.

08:23.225 --> 08:26.628
How did you and A&M come together? Who contacted 
whom? We have an organization of student

08:30.091 --> 08:36.257
personnel administrators in the state called 
CUSPA. And Dean Hannigan and Howard Perry were

08:37.013 --> 08:41.699
members of that group. And in fact, we had worked 
closely together. I was the executive secretary

08:44.502 --> 08:49.128
of that association. And the Southwest 
Association as well, which took in four Southwest

08:49.308 --> 08:54.414
states. And they told me that Dean Hannigan was 
getting ready to retire. and they wondered if I

09:01.752 --> 09:05.103
might not be interested in a job. I said, you know, 
yeah. Of all these schools in the state of Texas

09:08.554 --> 09:14.091
that would fit my orientation, I think A&M would be 
as close as any. And so they just chatted with me

09:15.117 --> 09:18.601
about that. And the next contact was by Dr. 
Williams. He called me one afternoon and on the

09:22.245 --> 09:27.551
telephone asked me if I might be interested in it. 
And if so, if I would come and visit him. I'd never

09:30.134 --> 09:34.979
met, to my knowledge, Jack Williams before that. I 
had never visited with him in any way about

09:34.999 --> 09:37.922
anything. So that was the contact. And that was 
when? That was in the spring of... 1972. So

09:46.468 --> 09:51.153
he had been here then a year? 1973. 1973. So he'd 
been here two years plus because he came in the fall

09:52.635 --> 09:58.022
of November 1 of 70. What was your impression of him 
on first contact, first impressions? My first

10:07.012 --> 10:10.116
visit down was an interesting one. His office, of 
course, was in the building named after him, the

10:10.585 --> 10:17.861
administration building. And Elder Rowell met me 
and Dr. Williams had an appointment at the time and

10:18.041 --> 10:29.607
he was running just a little bit late. So Nelda 
introduced me to two young students who were

10:30.194 --> 10:39.968
finishing up their degrees and they had me join 
them for a cup of coffee. One was Kent Caperton and

10:40.068 --> 10:44.795
the other was Roger Miller. And so I had coffee with 
those two kids and they were super and we had a good

10:44.815 --> 10:50.323
chat. All of a sudden Nelda said Dr. Williams was 
ready and available We went in and we didn't talk

10:56.283 --> 11:21.312
but a couple minutes and he shoveled me off to 
Howard Perry and I was on my way for the day and so I

10:56.283 --> 11:21.312
had lunch with the faculty and staff and students 
and did a bunch of things around the campus and my

10:56.283 --> 11:21.312
day was over and Howard

10:56.283 --> 11:21.312
Perry asked me if there was anything else that I 
would like to do and I said well Well, I had a talk

11:21.646 --> 11:23.570
with Dr. Williams. I guess he was busy and you know, 
I'd like to talk, chat with him about some concerns

11:23.590 --> 11:31.405
that I had. And so Howard called over to Nelda and 
Nelda said, oh yeah, his schedule is wide open. So

11:38.639 --> 11:43.148
my thought was, he wasn't interested in me. And so 
when I went by the office, I chatted with him a

11:43.347 --> 11:54.021
little bit about those concerns, and I drove back 
to Commerce that late afternoon, early evening.

11:54.041 --> 12:00.069
And my thought was he was not interested, and so he 
just had me down to visit, and that was it. Found out

12:00.709 --> 12:09.000
later that he had made up his mind very quickly that 
I was the one that he wanted for the job. And he

12:09.588 --> 12:12.492
didn't need to talk to me anymore. But he was such a 
bright man. I enjoyed the conversations

12:18.080 --> 12:26.952
with him. He had a good sense of humor, most people 
didn't know that.

12:36.765 --> 12:38.127
When I first came back, He called me and had me come 
by and he wanted to give me his assessment of all the

12:39.136 --> 12:48.506
key administrative people on campus at that time. 
And basically who he trusted and who he didn't and

12:48.546 --> 12:54.593
who he liked and who he didn't like. And so that was, 
you know, that was great for me to find out

12:54.613 --> 13:02.662
immediately about all the people on campus. It was 
an interesting discussion and conversation that

13:02.682 --> 13:06.406
I will never forget. All right, now this first this 
first visit, was that your only pre-offer visit?

13:15.863 --> 13:22.451
What were your concerns as you came for that visit? 
What were you wanting to learn? Well, I had been to

13:25.895 --> 13:35.126
A&M a couple times in the past on recruiting 
visits, recruiting staff. And so I was familiar

13:35.146 --> 13:37.189
with the campus. I had talked to enough people over 
the years and, of course, the fact that I went to the

13:37.540 --> 13:50.518
University of Arkansas and A&M was a part of the 
Southwest Conference, you know, I knew quite a bit

13:37.540 --> 13:50.518
about A&M. Plus, in the service, summer camp, so my 
contact and association with A&M had more depth to

13:50.558 --> 14:07.142
it than, you know, just the first visit and coming 
on campus to meet with Dr. Williams. I felt real

14:08.168 --> 14:10.671
good about A&M. I felt real good about the 
opportunities here. And when I say

14:13.674 --> 14:27.070
opportunities, I think anybody that goes into 
some kind of profession wants to be able to do a lot

14:13.674 --> 14:27.070
of good things professionally. And for the most 
part, just about anything that you go into, it

14:27.090 --> 14:32.556
takes money. and East Texas State did not have the 
financial resources. And when I said

14:38.105 --> 14:45.773
opportunities, one, they really didn't have a 
good student-like program at A&M at the time. So

14:45.793 --> 14:47.435
the sky was the limit there. Plus, in regard to the 
money, I thought a lot of money could be brought

14:48.656 --> 14:59.207
into the program to develop a real first-class 
program. Although I came afield, when I came into

15:02.371 --> 15:05.015
the student personnel business. I learned very 
quickly what in the world the profession was and

15:07.198 --> 15:11.924
what it took and what it was all about. And I really 
worked hard at learning. And in regard to a good

15:16.110 --> 15:21.838
student life program, you need staff and you need 
money and you need facilities. Did Dr. Williams

15:23.481 --> 15:28.908
have any specific goals that he gave you? The most 
important one to him at that time He had seen Dean

15:33.050 --> 15:57.813
Hannigan as a good man, but a military man, and that 
in regard to our student body, the voluntary Corps

15:33.050 --> 15:57.813
of Cadet program, and the size of the student body 
as it increased, using our terminology here, was

15:33.050 --> 15:57.813
going to be mostly civilian and very small numbers 
in the Corps of Cadets. And so he was concerned that

16:00.792 --> 16:03.635
We'd take care of all the students. Secondly, and I 
say secondly, equal to that was concern about

16:03.755 --> 16:12.743
women and involving the women. And then, of 
course, we just, all the institutions in the state

16:12.763 --> 16:19.329
of Texas had not been integrated that far. And so he 
had a concern also about the integration of the

16:19.349 --> 16:28.757
minorities into A&M and into the student line 
program. So those were his major. He was super as an

16:31.829 --> 16:40.698
administrator in the sense that when he brought 
you in to do a job, he didn't tell you all the things

16:31.829 --> 16:40.698
he wanted you to do. He mentioned what his concerns 
was. But it was yours to run with.

16:49.186 --> 16:54.391
And so the period of time that I worked with him. He 
would not agree to everything just because you

16:54.611 --> 16:58.795
thought it was a good idea. And on numerous 
occasions when I had meetings with him,

16:59.197 --> 17:07.547
especially about major problems, we'd reach an 
impasse. And he was very strong. He'd get very

17:09.289 --> 17:12.453
strong. And on those occasions, I would just kind 
of back off. And I'd wait until he was emotionally

17:17.439 --> 17:28.512
back down to a good level, emotionally more 
stable, before I'd approach that subject or

17:17.439 --> 17:28.512
whatever again. In every case, he was always 
agreeable to doing what I thought would be best for

17:28.745 --> 17:36.413
the program. So as an administrator that worked 
for him, he was the best that you could have. Let's

17:44.781 --> 17:47.304
make believe someone had never seen Dr. Williams. 
Describe him physically. He was about average

17:50.067 --> 17:51.528
height.

17:54.311 --> 17:56.153
I call it a square face. His body build was almost 
that same way. Always

17:59.818 --> 18:04.403
a smile.

18:07.747 --> 18:22.022
Unless he was emotionally involved or serious 
about something, he was relaxed and very

18:07.747 --> 18:22.022
personable, casual.

18:23.352 --> 18:33.545
I say square because he was, through the thoracic 
region, was a broad-chested individual. He was a

18:33.565 --> 18:35.787
well-built man. I never saw him in shorts. We 
played golf together a lot, but he never wore

18:37.650 --> 18:42.195
shorts on a golf course. But well-built 
individual. What were his relaxing

18:47.762 --> 18:52.548
activities? What did he do? One, he loved to play 
golf. Most people didn't know that. It's

19:00.628 --> 19:03.933
interesting that you would say relaxing. I'm not 
sure it was that relaxing, but it took his mind off

19:03.993 --> 19:10.122
of what he did day by day. Did you all play at the 
university courts? No, oh no. We played down in

19:13.226 --> 19:14.408
Brocker. He didn't want to play with him. There 
were only

19:20.525 --> 19:23.908
two other people that he played with, of which I'm 
aware. One was General Simpson, and that was only

19:24.729 --> 19:29.514
at the beginning when General Simpson went to work 
for me. That kind of dropped off by the wayside. And

19:31.736 --> 19:35.840
the other one was Bob Rucker, who ended up at 
Grounds. You know, Bob was the what? Yeah, Grounds

19:39.344 --> 19:41.025
Mains person. Yeah, headed that up. Bob had an 
artificial left hand, but, you know, played well.

19:49.398 --> 19:52.363
I played well for that handicap that he had. Dr. 
Williams was a well-coordinated individual, but

19:52.383 --> 20:00.996
he had started playing golf late in life. And the 
funniest thing that if there was a tree within

20:06.830 --> 20:12.038
hundred yards and it could be only two inches in 
diameter, he'd find that tree. And I never did hear

20:13.480 --> 20:19.149
him curse, but I heard words and sounds. But he 
would slip out to the golf course and slip on back

20:20.611 --> 20:27.522
in. He really didn't want to be seen by anybody. He 
really didn't want to interact with anybody other

20:30.078 --> 20:36.367
than with the group he was playing. And did he have 
other activities that were getaway, relax? You

20:42.777 --> 20:46.663
know, other than family and home, I can't think of 
anything else. Because I don't know about fishing

20:46.683 --> 20:52.311
or hunting or long vacations. He really lived his 
job 24 hours a day. Did you become aware during your

20:55.748 --> 21:03.740
years working with him that his Clemson 
experience was of value here at A&M? Do you

21:04.842 --> 21:06.805
remember any examples of that? Well, he had these 
good friends from Clemson that

21:08.467 --> 21:20.425
came to visit. that came as a staff member, I'm 
trying to think of his, Hugh McCauley, Hugh and

21:20.725 --> 21:29.615
Pinky McCauley.

21:31.718 --> 21:44.272
We had, Meridel and I saw Hugh and Pinky on a trip to 
Alaska, and Hugh was losing his eyesight, and

21:31.718 --> 21:44.272
cannot see anymore, he's blind. But in regard to, 
Clemson, I think, is a great deal like A&M. And I

21:53.831 --> 22:03.624
think it's a very conservative institution, 
conservative student body, conservative

21:53.831 --> 22:03.624
faculty and staff for the most part. So I think that 
all fit in to who Jack Williams was and was all

22:03.644 --> 22:09.552
about. And when I say conservative,

22:10.793 --> 22:18.964
I think probably When you say those terms, General 
Rutter was conservative, but there are two

22:20.463 --> 22:31.313
different types of conservative persons.

22:33.375 --> 22:38.040
Jack Williams was conservative as it related to 
finances and money. He wanted to save a penny. He

22:43.405 --> 22:46.588
wanted to use whatever money he had to develop good 
programs and programs that we needed within him

22:47.530 --> 22:50.774
academically. He wanted to have an outstanding 
faculty. He wanted to have an outstanding student

22:53.037 --> 22:54.800
body. That meant increasing salaries, more 
scholarships, and all of that. So he wasn't

22:59.967 --> 23:12.964
conservative in the same way that General Rudder 
was conservative, but philosophically

22:59.967 --> 23:12.964
conservative.

23:14.311 --> 23:20.660
He had a lot of things that he wanted to do that were 
not supported by the Board of Regents. And he tried

23:20.680 --> 23:30.915
to gain the confidence and the relationship with 
the Board of Regents so he could implement more of

23:20.680 --> 23:30.915
those things that he wanted to. For example, I know 
he wanted the fraternities and sororities. He

23:34.861 --> 23:42.512
thought they would be good for our campus because 
they would involve more of the male and females

23:43.420 --> 23:50.007
student activities of one type or another that 
were not in the core of cadets and the board was not

23:43.420 --> 23:50.007
interested back at that time. Did you and or he 
bring that issue up in any way with board members?

23:56.495 --> 24:03.503
He told me at the time that he would keep it in his 
back pocket and hit the board when it was the right

23:56.495 --> 24:03.503
time.

24:08.829 --> 24:12.533
It never became full-blown early on And the 
fraternities and sororities that were initiated

24:12.968 --> 24:19.075
were initiated off campus without the 
relationship with Texas A&M. Did you and Dr.

24:19.335 --> 24:22.919
Williams ever discuss fraternities and 
sororities? Oh, many, many times. I was very

24:24.801 --> 24:26.943
supportive. I'm trying to think of the name of the 
committee. Was it Target 2000? I think probably. I

24:34.071 --> 24:36.594
think that probably was it. We had a committee. We 
had a whole bunch of committees. and one related to

24:42.483 --> 24:45.927
student life. And I know on that committee we had a 
number of old legs, one of them being a Searcy Brace

24:46.868 --> 24:53.796
one. And I remember I used to approach that group 
all the time. That was back in the early 70s about

24:56.919 --> 25:09.133
how important it was for us to have attorneys and 
sororities recognized on our particular campus.

25:09.153 --> 25:11.916
The one I told them, and Dr. Williams agreed, that 
if they were going to be here, it would be better for

25:12.824 --> 25:20.513
us to have a relationship with them than not have 
any relationship at all. And I thought any student

25:20.533 --> 25:28.562
organization could have a positive impact, both 
upon the students and the campus, if you take that

25:20.533 --> 25:28.562
orientation. And so those people, sort of seeing a 
number of other people, The fact that they like Dr.

25:37.462 --> 25:42.971
Williams and they like me, they listen to us in 
terms of... There were a couple board members,

25:44.974 --> 25:50.263
Julie Bell being one, and I'm not sure who else was 
around. They were totally against it and opposed

25:50.283 --> 25:53.328
to it. And then what happened was that got all 
locked up in the

25:54.430 --> 26:03.705
Melanie Zentgraf case. When the federal judge in 
Houston ruled that the gay student services

26:04.360 --> 26:22.259
organization was a social organization, and 
since A&M did not recognize fraternities and

26:04.360 --> 26:22.259
sororities, they didn't have to recognize the gay 
student services organization. So it got tied up

26:23.601 --> 26:29.587
in that, and so therefore the board was not about to 
recognize it then. And then when it went to the

26:29.607 --> 26:32.190
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and they reversed 
that decision, then fraternities and

26:32.575 --> 26:43.179
sororities, as well as the gay student services 
organizations, were able to be recognized. Let's

26:43.640 --> 26:50.635
hold that whole thing for a while.

26:51.155 --> 27:00.429
commencement to attend as an A&M employee, I was 
seated this close to her when she did not get her

26:51.155 --> 27:00.429
hand shaken. With Bill Hobby right here, we were 
shooting the breeze. All right, let's go back to

27:04.576 --> 27:07.019
your early days. Who were the key people in the 
student affairs area when you came?

27:17.876 --> 27:18.377
The Tom Parsons was the Commandant of the Corps of 
Cadets. And back at that time, the person that

27:25.791 --> 27:38.364
served as head of the Army ROTC program by virtue of 
that position, a military officer, was the

27:25.791 --> 27:38.364
Commandant. Charles Powell was the Dean of Men. 
Toby Reeves was the Dean of Women. Hal Poe was the

27:44.351 --> 27:46.853
Director of Student Health Services. J. Wayne 
Stark was the and director of Memorial Student

27:50.403 --> 27:55.528
Center.

27:55.548 --> 28:04.697
Bob Logan was the director of financial aid, 
although Bob Logan did not work for me then,

27:55.548 --> 28:04.697
financial aid reported the academic center. So 
those were there. And they had all, pretty well all

28:07.500 --> 28:11.184
of those were veterans, weren't they? Except for 
maybe Toby. They'd been here a good while. And

28:16.269 --> 28:20.173
y'all were, by and large, y'all were quartered 
where? mostly in the YMCA

28:20.778 --> 28:25.766
building. And, of course, the Student Center 
people, you know, were over in the Student Center.

28:31.154 --> 28:47.359
Back at that time, Wayne Stark

28:31.154 --> 28:47.359
had student government and all the student 
organizations and the Student Center Council, so

28:31.154 --> 28:47.359
he was really key person for all student 
organizations and I thought that was too much and

28:49.280 --> 28:56.535
that we ought to separate it out. The programming 
part of the MSC, I had done the same thing at East

28:57.176 --> 29:04.572
Texas State when I took over there. After I got 
involved with it, I thought it was, it would Two

29:08.888 --> 29:13.975
separate programs in a whole lot of different 
issues. I saw the student center as a programming

29:14.917 --> 29:19.083
operation for the entire campus. Provide all 
kinds of programs. I saw student government and

29:22.768 --> 29:29.358
student organizations as being separate and 
apart from that. Student government, of course,

29:29.398 --> 29:36.769
for the student body to represent itself to me, the 
president of the institution, and to the faculty.

29:37.070 --> 29:42.540
and student activities, I thought there ought to 
be a zillion organizations. One of the things that

29:43.762 --> 29:51.836
I liked about the Corps is the fact that you operate 
in small groups and you have this affiliation with

29:43.762 --> 29:51.836
a few people. And if that's a good situation, then 
you feel good about the larger unit. and

29:59.176 --> 30:00.759
eventually to the university. And so as long as it 
was legal and didn't cost us too much money, we

30:00.779 --> 30:10.715
could support any new student organization. So 
Carolyn Adair hired Carolyn in the summer of 74 to

30:11.075 --> 30:18.908
be director of student activities. Now, she had 
been working? On the MSC staff. So she was familiar

30:21.612 --> 30:25.318
with that part of it. but worked for J. Wayne Stark.

30:31.938 --> 30:33.580
Generalize about Wayne Stark. Describe him and 
his efforts and so forth. Wayne

30:39.307 --> 30:54.225
had a tremendous interest in young people, in 
working with young people, in seeing young people

30:39.307 --> 30:54.225
succeed and better themselves. do great things. 
He was an interesting guy in the sense that he would

30:58.121 --> 31:16.981
fight whomever, General Rutter and whoever else, 
if he thought he was right and they were wrong in

30:58.121 --> 31:16.981
regard to what he needed to do. We had a super 
relationship because I respected who he was and

31:18.462 --> 31:23.908
what he did. I had to be careful though because Dr. 
Williams was not General Rudder.
