WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:03.395
My name is Jesus Montes. And you were born in? Here 
in El Paso. I was born here in El Paso. All right, and

00:09.204 --> 00:11.888
your name? It's Bertha Portras Montes. And you 
were born? Here in El Paso. All right, I'll begin

00:15.714 --> 00:20.402
with you. Your family, where was your family from? 
Well, my father was from Allende, Valle de

00:23.026 --> 00:28.314
Allende, Chihuahua. That's where he was born. And 
my mother from Zacatecas. Zacatecas, Zacatecas,

00:34.141 --> 00:37.005
capital of the state of Zacatecas. How did they 
meet? My mother was, at the time, after the attack

00:39.768 --> 00:50.221
of Zacatecas from Machovilla, they captured a 
city, they had to leave. So they came to Chihuahua

00:50.782 --> 00:54.186
and stayed with some of her relatives there. My 
mother got a job working in the hospital. I guess

00:58.206 --> 01:01.510
the way she tells me, it's sort of a nurse's aide. 
Now, where in Chihuahua was this? Chihuahua,

01:05.234 --> 01:06.795
Chihuahua. Chihuahua City. Yes, and that's where 
she met my father. He was in the hospital

01:13.723 --> 01:16.085
recuperating from a bullet wound. And after that, 
he left the hospital in here. Well, how did he

01:23.213 --> 01:25.135
happen to get the bullet wound? Yeah, I haven't got 
it clear, you know that? I don't know. My mother

01:28.783 --> 01:33.949
tells me that he was brought in with a wounded from 
Salaya. Now, where or how he got it, I really don't

01:34.709 --> 01:37.432
know. What year was this? Do you remember? Oh, it 
must have been in, let's see, I think it was 14, 19,

01:40.095 --> 01:49.184
14, 19, 13, somewhere in there. I really don't 
know, because I was born in 1918, so I'm just

01:49.204 --> 01:54.750
assuming you know it, because... They were 
married about two years before I was born. Must

02:00.329 --> 02:02.932
have been 1914 or 1913. Was your father a soldier? 
Yes, he was. He was a soldier.

02:11.142 --> 02:13.624
Of course, I haven't got records on that. Well, not 
records, but a few papers that he left. He was a

02:17.189 --> 02:18.150
captain.

02:21.514 --> 02:24.197
He had to leave Chihuahua. after because sort of a 
political refugee. Who was he fighting with? With

02:33.411 --> 02:34.053
Villa. With Banjo-Rica? Yeah, but the man that 
wanted to hang him was Murguia, General Murguia.

02:40.867 --> 02:42.490
Now, I don't know who Murguia was. fighting for. 
See, that's one thing that I've never gotten

02:44.676 --> 02:47.098
clear. It's pretty confusing. People change 
sides a lot. Well, I don't know. So many

02:52.322 --> 02:58.347
politicians, they had their own people, powers, 
you might call them. And according to my father,

03:00.229 --> 03:09.197
during the revolution, at one time they were 
friends, another time they were enemies, so I

03:00.229 --> 03:09.197
really don't know. How did he happen to join Pancho 
Villa? Did he ever talk about that? No, no, only

03:14.195 --> 03:26.030
that according to his brothers, he was sort of the 
black sheep of the family, you know, the sheep of

03:14.195 --> 03:26.030
the family. He was a rough one, in other words, 
because none of the brothers joined the

03:26.390 --> 03:34.621
revolution. He was the only one. And they were 
always peaceful and all that. Well, my father used

03:41.730 --> 03:43.712
to read that out.

03:47.827 --> 03:57.864
And I guess that's how he left home and joined the 
forces.

03:57.884 --> 04:02.292
I really don't know too much about it, but that's 
what I heard him talk about. Well, what was his

04:02.312 --> 04:03.594
background? What had his father been, your 
grandfather? Farmer. They were farmers, yes. Did

04:07.301 --> 04:08.363
they have their own land? They had a little patch of 
land over in What do they call it? Valle de Allende.

04:14.438 --> 04:15.038
Valle de Allende, yeah. Valle de Allende. It's 
somewhere near Parral. That's what I understand.

04:18.542 --> 04:20.384
I've never been that far myself. The farthest I've 
been is Camargo. That's as far as I've been into

04:23.608 --> 04:26.831
Mexico. Well then, your father met your mother in 
Chihuahua City, and they married there? No, right

04:33.259 --> 04:34.981
after he left the hospital. Right after he left the 
hospital. And then how did it happen that he had to

04:37.507 --> 04:40.490
leave? This man wanted to hang him. Well, it seemed 
like, you know, we as forces quit fighting or laid

04:42.132 --> 04:49.359
down our arms. And then it seemed like he was 
already at peace. And we came to Chihuahua, I

04:57.728 --> 05:03.594
guess, just for a visit or I don't know. And my 
father, knew him very well, so he went riding

05:06.835 --> 05:11.600
around in his car. And after Villa left and his men 
left, my father stayed back in Chihuahua, and then

05:13.402 --> 05:27.658
Murguia, he started rounding up all the 
villistas, or ex-villistas, whatever you want to

05:13.402 --> 05:27.658
call them, and hanging them, you see. And somehow, 
I don't know what my father ever told Murguia or

05:27.678 --> 05:36.167
what Murguia had against my father, but he said, I 
want him dead or alive. So he had to leave

05:36.721 --> 05:40.065
everything he had in Chihuahua. He had a little 
store, and he had to leave everything. According

05:43.890 --> 05:51.961
to my mother, this is what my mother told me, from 
Chihuahua they went to Aldama, disguised as the

05:43.890 --> 05:51.961
peasants, you know. And there they got on a train, 
it was coming towards Juarez, and that's how they

05:52.001 --> 06:00.993
came right straight to El Paso. And my father will, 
many, many years before you, went back to Mexico.

06:07.838 --> 06:09.040
Oh, he did go back to Mexico? Yeah, he did go back to 
Mexico. It was always his dream of going back to

06:11.123 --> 06:13.946
Mexico. I don't know. But when he was here, the only 
reason he was here was because he was safe. He was

06:21.817 --> 06:23.139
safe here. And what year did he go back to Mexico? Do 
you remember? Well, let's see. I was around 14. In

06:33.269 --> 06:36.833
fact, that was the reason my mother separated my 
father. She didn't want to go back to Mexico. She

06:38.695 --> 06:40.458
wanted to stay here. And he insisted, and they 
insisted, and they broke up. I mean, you know, I

06:44.022 --> 06:53.433
really don't know what happened, but he decided he 
wanted to go back to Mexico, so he got this. So what

06:53.453 --> 06:54.434
year were you born? 1918. 1918. And they crossed 
the border into the States? Oh, I think... Right

07:03.155 --> 07:04.357
before I was born. So it would have been 1917 or 
1918. And how many children were there? In my

07:11.467 --> 07:13.069
family, there was five. Only the youngest, I'm the 
oldest, lived. When they were children? When they

07:22.763 --> 07:25.006
were children, yes. And what did your father do 
while he lived here in El Paso? Well, he was an

07:29.716 --> 07:37.988
invalid then, because the bullet wound, you know, 
he was crippled for life. He couldn't be hired. He

07:41.092 --> 07:45.598
couldn't work for anybody, so he himself made his 
own living. He sold vegetables, he sold I don't

07:53.054 --> 07:54.396
know. He'd done so many things, and we were in so 
many places. We went out to California, picked

07:56.819 --> 08:02.287
fruit, and a lot of things like that. So you went a 
lot. You didn't just stay in El Paso. You went to a

08:05.051 --> 08:06.153
lot of different places. No, no. My father was sort 
of a wanderer. He never could stay in one place. And

08:12.122 --> 08:16.168
that was another reason my mother didn't want to 
follow him anymore. I had a sister born in

08:17.610 --> 08:19.973
Colorado. My brother was born in California. We 
were just all over the country. Mostly picking

08:25.808 --> 08:27.209
crops? Crops and I don't know what else. He did so 
many things. But he always worked for himself. He

08:36.598 --> 08:38.780
always had things going. In other words, projects 
like a small restaurant or something like that.

08:43.103 --> 08:45.005
What happened when he went back to Mexico? Do you 
know where he went? He started farming again. In

08:49.518 --> 08:51.220
the same place? No, down here between Chihuahua 
and Juarez, in a place called Villamada. And then

08:58.186 --> 09:03.951
he started getting sick, old and sick, you know, 
and so he had to leave the farm. And then came the

09:03.971 --> 09:11.438
Juarez, and he was very sick the last time I saw him 
in Juarez, and he said, I'm going to leave Juarez,

09:03.971 --> 09:11.438
I'm going to go to a warmer climate, and I think I can 
do well. So he was on his way to the southern part of

09:12.219 --> 09:19.305
Mexico, I don't know where, but he only made it to 
Chihuahua City, That's where he died. And what

09:21.289 --> 09:22.811
year did he die? And I wonder, was Alfredo born 50 
this year? Bertalicia was... Alfredo was one year

09:25.955 --> 09:30.641
old when he died. Was it 53 then? 52. 52? He died in 53 
then. Do you know about how old he was when he died?

09:39.713 --> 09:43.478
Oh, about 64, maybe 64, 65. So he was a fairly young 
man during the revolution. Yes, he was. Yes, he

09:46.962 --> 09:47.723
was. I had a picture. What did I do with the picture? 
Would you like to see it? I would like to very much. I

09:52.422 --> 09:53.283
don't know where it is. While you're getting the 
picture, then I'll start with you. Where were your

09:58.009 --> 09:59.771
mother and father from? My father was from 
Chihuahua. Chihuahua City? Chihuahua City. My

10:04.176 --> 10:06.519
mother was from Camaro, Chihuahua. But my mother, 
she comes from her father and mother Born in Italy.

10:14.616 --> 10:15.056
In Italy? In Italy. And what were their names 
there? Bassanetti, Visconti. And then they came,

10:19.803 --> 10:25.211
I think, when they had only three children, and 
then came to Camargo. And my grandfather had a

10:26.372 --> 10:28.656
bakery. That was a part of my mother. But from my 
father, they were from the Chihuahua Chihuahua.

10:37.288 --> 10:40.693
And what I hear, there were 13 of them. Thirteen in 
your... In my father's. In your father's family.

10:44.564 --> 10:47.188
Brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles and 
everything. And they were kind of wealthy.

10:52.415 --> 10:52.555
Mm-hmm. Kind of my father. My grandfather had a... 
Well, it wasn't a farm. It was more like a colonia

10:58.143 --> 11:01.047
for non-Muslims. Mm-hmm. And it was 13 ranches 
altogether. Outside of Chihuahua? It was in Casas

11:10.045 --> 11:11.186
Grandes. Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, right? They 
used to call it Colonia Fernandez Leal. But when

11:18.412 --> 11:25.179
this started, all the revolution and everything, 
they had about eight daughters, my grandfather,

11:18.412 --> 11:25.179
see? And he was afraid that something would happen 
to them. So the only thing they... They brought

11:30.860 --> 11:39.394
here to El Paso their mattress and whatever 
luggage they could take and bring, see? Because

11:39.674 --> 11:41.777
they were afraid of the ballistas. And this is your 
mother and father? This is my mother and the side of

11:43.981 --> 11:48.148
my father. Oh. On the side of my father. So they came 
over and it was about 1910 they were here. And they

11:55.860 --> 11:57.222
never went back. Now, this is before he married 
your mother? Oh, yes. Before he married her. Did

12:00.915 --> 12:01.716
they ever talk? Did your father ever talk about 
what it was like? Well, my father didn't used to

12:04.279 --> 12:06.903
talk too much. But my aunt, the one that I had, , she 
was the one that got charge of the 13 ranches. She

12:14.613 --> 12:16.155
was the only one left. My father, well, he was an 
engineer. And they didn't left him anything.

12:24.404 --> 12:26.487
because he got married, and you know how they were. 
This is after he got Del Paso. Yes. Yes, he got

12:30.152 --> 12:31.373
married. But my aunt was the one... Excuse me. Let 
me just... What I think I'll do is draw a picture so

12:34.678 --> 12:41.667
that I can get an idea of who's who. All right, 
here's your mother, and her name was... Maria.

12:45.993 --> 12:46.534
Maria. And when she... You wanted... Before she 
got married. Yeah. Bazzanetti Visconti.

12:54.020 --> 12:57.043
Basenete.

12:57.063 --> 12:59.025
Double T. Yeah. Visconte. Visconte. And your 
father was? Jose. Jose. Porres. Porres. Ugarte.

13:13.261 --> 13:13.641
Ugarte. That's right. All right. Now your mother 
and your mother's parents We're from Italy, both

13:20.918 --> 13:24.081
of you. And your mother's name was? My what? Your 
grandmother on your mother's side. Rosa. Rosa.

13:33.389 --> 13:40.414

And your grandfather. Carlos. Carlos. Visconti. 
I mean, Bassanetti. Bassanetti. Bassanetti,

13:49.102 --> 13:50.503
that's the one. It's not there? And they came from 
Italy after they were married. They had three

13:57.250 --> 13:58.231
children. Oh, yeah. They had three children up 
there. My mother was one. Did they ever say why they

14:01.534 --> 14:03.376
came from Italy? Well, I think they never... You 
see, I was very small when my mother died. I was

14:11.503 --> 14:12.884
about seven years old. I couldn't remember 
exactly, but I know they came from Italy. But my...

14:20.622 --> 14:24.892
Now my mother and my father, they met here in El 
Paso. Okay, they met in El Paso. And I think it was

14:27.177 --> 14:34.092
that time of 1916, because my brother was born in 
1917. All right, how did your mother's family

14:34.190 --> 14:37.454
happen to come to El Paso? Well, you see, they 
always used to come here to buy things. Her

14:41.338 --> 14:46.184
clothes, winter clothes and summer clothes, 
because they were from El Paso. And that's where

14:46.204 --> 14:47.545
she met. Well, she knew my father in Chihuahua 
because she used to go with my mother over there.

14:52.211 --> 14:57.817
And, in fact, my father wasn't even going with my 
mother, but with her cousin or something. But when

14:57.837 --> 15:00.180
they came here to buy clothes or something, He was 
here because he was here, my father was here since

15:00.616 --> 15:04.482
1910. So they met here and got married and they 
stayed here. So her family though, her brothers

15:09.549 --> 15:12.974
and sisters didn't come here. Oh no, no. They 
stayed over there. They're still in Mexico. In

15:15.998 --> 15:16.880

has a drugstore in Camargo. Rodolfo Bazanete. Oh,

Five girls. And they're all married now. And they

15:46.790 --> 15:47.992
all live in Mexico. They do.

15:52.709 --> 15:54.891
And who were the other children in that family? The 
brothers? Of your mother. Well, there's that she

15:58.836 --> 16:03.521
was married to one of her brothers. She's leaving. 
She's in another that I have there.

16:10.329 --> 16:13.933
Now, what did her husband do? He was a farmer.

16:18.218 --> 16:21.602
In he has these farms.

16:23.405 --> 16:26.831
And are there any others that are no longer living? 
Oh, yes. There was a, well, there's the, like, I'm

16:29.016 --> 16:32.863
the daughter, you know. There's the Juan Camaro 
Severo Garza. He has a drugstore. This is a son?

16:41.579 --> 16:43.904

17:01.053 --> 17:03.418

17:04.124 --> 17:08.070
So all this side of the family stayed in Mexico. Did 
they have any trouble during the revolution, or

17:08.450 --> 17:11.995
did they just, they didn't? Well, I don't know, but 
they used to tell me that one of Pancho Villa's men,

17:12.556 --> 17:20.808
because on my mother's side, they were kind of 
wealthy, you know. There was one, Alberto. that

17:23.733 --> 17:26.476
was killed by one of Pacho Villa's men. And I don't 
know if it's true or not, but he never came back

17:27.577 --> 17:31.742
home. Because he used to wear those, how do you call 
those? One, they used to wear the man's on their

17:37.269 --> 17:39.932
tie. Jewelry? Yeah, something. Jewelry? Yeah. 
And they used to say that one of the men's a poor

17:43.676 --> 17:46.720
shaman. He told him that he wanted that jewelry. 
And his uncle said, no, you come and get it. So the

17:51.678 --> 17:53.220
other were just shot. And dead. And dead. And

grandfather and asked him to lend him some money or 
something like that. I don't know what. But my

it. And I have the Porfirio Diaz, everything

19:53.098 --> 19:56.183
that... The signature? Yeah, I have Porfirio Diaz 
for mining. I have things, but not for the ranches.

20:01.933 --> 20:02.734
I can't find it. Because by Ed, she used to keep 
everything in a little box or something. And she

20:07.758 --> 20:11.764
was very sick when she came down here, when she 
died, see? So part was over there and she wallowed,

20:12.185 --> 20:15.029
part was over here. We couldn't get the things that 
were in the wall. But I have, if you want to see, yes,

20:18.153 --> 20:22.099
I have this. Oh, surely. And I have a, for a lot of 
things, not only, and I thought this was, Now,

20:31.096 --> 20:45.809
what had your grandfather, Jose Perez,

20:31.096 --> 20:45.809
what kind of work did he do before he had the 
ranches? Well, I think I can tell you. He must have

20:49.752 --> 20:52.194
had something. Because they were wealthy. I think 
they had money.

21:05.993 --> 21:09.779
Okay.

21:12.623 --> 21:34.937
That's right, you know.

21:35.474 --> 21:43.824
citada ley y su reglamento de 26 de junio de 1892. 
That's right. It was 25th of June, 1892. Could you

21:49.631 --> 21:51.653
just read the rest of it for me? This is the one that 
you want. I don't read it out loud that much. This is

21:53.555 --> 21:54.677
the one you want. This is the one you want. You were 
asking about the hectares and everything,

21:55.918 --> 21:59.762
something like that. I think it's there. But that 
writing, I'll tell you. It's hard to read. I think

22:07.030 --> 22:26.199
this was a brother of my grandfather,

22:07.030 --> 22:26.199
Celso Lugo.

22:26.540 --> 22:35.113
That's mining.

22:35.684 --> 22:47.122
And here's the signature of

22:35.684 --> 22:47.122
Porfirio Diaz. And here's the signature of 
Porfirio Diaz. These are fascinating. I think

22:52.897 --> 22:56.180
what I'll do is maybe just copy these in a few 
minutes. Okay. Just fine. But I don't know

22:58.182 --> 22:59.684
what's... When was the date of this? It was... It's 
the 25th of June, 1892. Yes, that's right. And

23:07.953 --> 23:16.562
that's when your grandfather... And I was going to 
show you another... Because this... I don't know

23:16.582 --> 23:18.303
if I threw them my way. I was so dumb. I don't know. 
Because this thing's... You can read the, you read

23:22.377 --> 23:24.139
Spanish? Mm-hmm. Well, it's part of it. This is 
what they, talking about the ranches and

23:27.242 --> 23:41.178
everything.

23:41.198 --> 23:44.381
Now, oh, this is, this is in 1931. Yeah, that was my 
father, Ingeniero Jose Porres Ugarte. He was

23:47.264 --> 23:51.709
representing my aunts, Josefina and Santiago 
Porres Ugarte. But here, the other page, once you

23:52.550 --> 24:03.327
turn this way, this is what starts in St. David.

24:06.251 --> 24:11.039
Because they were having trouble with the ones 
that left there to take care of them. And that's why

24:11.440 --> 24:13.663
my father was one. They used

24:14.369 --> 24:34.452
to have a lot of

24:14.369 --> 24:34.452
names.

24:36.074 --> 24:41.760
Here it is.

24:42.449 --> 24:46.134
I can see because my eyes go that way.

24:48.297 --> 24:48.978
Where was I? That

24:49.459 --> 24:59.914
was his name. That

25:01.296 --> 25:06.664
was my uncle. That was my other uncle. I already 
forgot them there. Que se encontraban ubicadas en

25:14.610 --> 25:21.437
la Colonia Fernández Real del Distrito Galeán, 
Estado de Chihuahua, México. Y por otra parte, por

25:21.457 --> 25:25.220
el señor Simón Parra. He was one of the Mexicans 
that stayed over there. Mayor de Edad,

25:28.263 --> 25:39.054
agricultor, vecino de la Colonia Fernández Real, 
por medio del presente documento, ha concretado

25:28.263 --> 25:39.054
un contrato, un meeting, con las bases 
siguientes. Las señoritas... They agree to rent,

25:41.174 --> 25:51.527
they were going to rent to this man, Simon Parra, 
all the land of his property for the duration of

25:41.174 --> 25:51.527
three years. To change from this date, recognized 
by Mr. Simon Parra, a fourth of all and each of the

25:52.448 --> 26:05.764
products that are obtained live concretely from 
all the land. Thank

26:05.980 --> 26:27.060
you.

26:27.395 --> 26:32.082
Una cuarta parte, that's what they were going to 
get, a fourth of everything. That your father

26:32.362 --> 26:34.165
would be getting a fourth. My aunts, not my father. 
But he was taking charge. He was representing.

26:38.572 --> 26:39.553
Yeah, that's right. Now, why would it be just your 
aunts and your father wouldn't be getting

26:39.573 --> 26:42.638
anything? Because he got married. And when he got 
married, he was, how do you say, they didn't

26:44.120 --> 26:52.052
believe when you get married, you just stay by 
yourself and forget about the other people.

26:52.876 --> 26:55.842
Because my aunts didn't get married, see? So they 
have that to live on. I see. So he was giving up any

26:58.608 --> 27:02.857
rights that he might have in the land so that they 
could have it. Now, let's go back and kind of

27:03.458 --> 27:08.870
reconstruct the story. Your father was Jose. And 
then he had how many brothers and sisters? Oh, my

27:17.012 --> 27:17.533
Lord. Here, let me correct you. I was thinking 
about my grandfather, and his name was Jose Jesus

27:19.517 --> 27:25.069
Maria. And I forgot that. Jesus? Maria. Maria was 
your grandfather. And

27:31.401 --> 27:38.633
he's the one that received the land from Refidio 
Diaz in 1892. And he had how many children? He had

27:41.338 --> 27:42.640
your father, Jose. There were 13. I don't remember 
all of them. I know that there were two Jose's and

27:46.065 --> 27:48.570
two Josefina's. I remember that. Two Jose's. Yes, 
because one died when my father was born in Mexico.

27:53.997 --> 27:56.540
Oh, I see. Okay, there was a Jose who died young, and 
then there was a Josefina. Josefina, that's the

28:00.063 --> 28:02.506
one they're talking about here. And she never 
married? No, none of them married. None of the

28:06.670 --> 28:08.432
girls married, nor the boys. I think your father 
was the only one. My father was the only one.

28:11.435 --> 28:12.396
Thirteen children. All right, there was 
Josefina. And then was Gregorio. Gregorio, and he

28:17.361 --> 28:19.223
didn't marry? No. What did he do for a living? Well, 
he used to have a charge of this hacienda. He had a

28:26.682 --> 28:28.905
store, didn't he? Yeah. When they came here, he had 
a store. All right. But he wasn't in charge of the

28:33.012 --> 28:36.218
lands after he came here? No. No, no. They never 
went back. Okay. Now, Gregorio, after Gregorio,

28:38.662 --> 28:42.308
then? I don't know. Who was it? Gregorio. Well, put 
Maria, that she died here. Maria? Yeah. Now these

28:50.748 --> 28:52.090
people are all dead now. Matilda? They all died. 
They're all dead. Matilda? Matilda? She didn't

28:56.016 --> 28:56.958
marry you? No, no, no. The last one was my... And 
there was one, Josefina. Another Josefina.

29:03.629 --> 29:08.777
Because they put... Another, because there are 
two Josefinas. Maria, Matilde.

29:13.444 --> 29:15.628
Who was the other one? Gregorio. Luis. Luis. Luis. 
There was a Luis. How many are there? Maybe I'm

29:20.952 --> 29:22.274
going over, boy. Luis, now what did he do after he 
came to El Paso? He had a little store, too. This was

29:28.121 --> 29:29.222
Luis. And he never married? No, none of them. None 
of them. Only your father? Only my father. That's

29:34.168 --> 29:37.632
why he didn't have those friends, because he got 
married. He had a wife. He had a wife and kids. And

29:41.257 --> 29:48.025
that was my, the one that I remember now, Matielita 
Santiago, that was the one that died. How many

29:48.308 --> 29:49.509
years? 11 years ago? Santiago. Santiago. She put 
up a battle for those plants. She sure did. Made a

29:56.978 --> 29:58.941
lot of, paid a lot of money out. Go see about this. 
And she's the one that really tried the hardest to

30:01.043 --> 30:03.726
get this? Yes. She did. Like nothing. See, because 
they even had a, she had a cousin that was a senator

30:05.969 --> 30:11.776
in Mexico City. Uh-huh. And she even went to see 
him. Senador Francurias, Francurias. His was a

30:15.460 --> 30:17.724
cousin on your father's side or your mother's 
side? On my father's side. On your father's

30:18.805 --> 30:20.508
father's side. That's right. Because I couldn't 
tell you about my... Your father's mother? No. You

30:27.358 --> 30:28.600
don't know anything about her? I don't know 
anything about her. So how many were they? Well,

30:32.827 --> 30:36.793
I've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, 
eight, nine cousins. I think I missed it. There may

30:39.861 --> 30:42.044
be, but still none of them married. None. And they 
all came to El Paso. They did. Now, how old was your

30:44.506 --> 30:47.069
father when he came to El Paso? Do you know? 
Roughly. He was born in 1881. And, um, 1881? Is that

30:52.074 --> 30:57.180
right? 1881, that's right. Because he was, he got 
married in 1917 or 1916. I think it was 1960 because

31:05.630 --> 31:09.080
my brother was born in 1970. Is that right? Yeah, 
he's only a year older than I am. Just a year older. I

31:16.970 --> 31:19.594
think he was about 22 or 23. He would have been about 
30. My

31:25.102 --> 31:29.589
father? If he was born in 1881 and he came in 1910, he 
would have been about 31. And he was an engineer

31:34.116 --> 31:39.124
already in Mexico. Where did he study? Mexico 
City. Was he one of the older children? No, he was

31:46.162 --> 31:47.243
the youngest. The youngest? Yes. He was younger 
than my aunt, Lita, who once died about 11 years. So

31:53.253 --> 31:56.518
these children had not married in Mexico before 
1910. No. Has there ever been any talk in the family

31:57.058 --> 32:01.405
about why none of them got married? Well, they were 
very strict over there in Mexico. They didn't let

32:04.683 --> 32:08.107
her, they didn't let them go out or do this. They 
were always home and growing. I don't know what

32:10.710 --> 32:13.974
they were doing, but they were doing something. 
One of them was going to get married, Matia

32:14.655 --> 32:18.419
Josefina. In fact, she was the first, she studied 
over there at the first secretary for, what was

32:18.640 --> 32:31.375
that big house they have over there in Chihuahua? 
It was a Francesa. My aunt used to talk about it. But

32:37.601 --> 32:39.803
I was so small, I couldn't remember. And she was 
old. She was very old. But she was one of the first

32:42.705 --> 32:45.808
secretary. In fact, when she got that job, they 
were all going to kill her. Or she was going to kill

32:50.893 --> 32:55.318
them, because they couldn't let a lady go out and 
work. It was terrible for them, see? But my aunt

32:57.820 --> 33:00.923
said, I'm going to work. Well, when she started 
working, it continued. Yeah, this was after they

33:03.512 --> 33:05.415
had come here to the stage. No, that was when she was 
over there. That's when she was in Chihuahua.

33:08.801 --> 33:13.629
Because I think they studied there in Chihuahua 
from where they were. From the ranchers, they sent

33:13.909 --> 33:16.513
them to Chihuahua to study. And from there, they 
all came over here. So this was your Aunt Josefina

33:20.560 --> 33:24.587
that went to work in Chihuahua in spite of her 
family. That's right. And your... Your

33:28.173 --> 33:32.258
grandmother and grandfather on your side 
actually lived on these ranches. Oh, yes, they

33:32.959 --> 33:34.181
did. And there's Casas Grandes. And then, do you 
remember how it was that they came in 1910 or 1911?

33:42.952 --> 33:45.315
What happened in those years that made them come? 
Well, I think that they knew that Pancho Villa was

33:45.335 --> 33:49.600
coming. He was passing through there. So they just 
came. Never went back. Why were they afraid of him?

33:57.355 --> 34:01.604
Because my grandfather was afraid for the girls, 
for his daughters. Oh, was that the reason? Yeah,

34:04.630 --> 34:06.053
that's what they used to tell me. That's why there 
were too many. I think there were eight or nine

34:08.598 --> 34:11.344
girls or something like that. So they had to come. 
But the boys, I mean, why didn't the sons stay with

34:13.634 --> 34:16.438
them? They were chicken, maybe. I don't know if 
they were or not, because with your grandfather

34:19.181 --> 34:30.675
having land given to him by Diaz, he might have been 
in pretty great danger in 1911, 1912. In fact, for

34:30.716 --> 34:34.300
many years thereafter, he would have been in 
danger. Because they never went back. No, they

34:36.042 --> 34:37.444
never went back at all. Now, when they came to El 
Paso, your grandfather, Jesus Maria, what did he

34:37.464 --> 34:42.190
do? To make a living. Well, I think that they put 
that store, a big store, that was the one that they

34:44.175 --> 34:49.570
were working all over. And my grandfather was very 
old. He was already very old. Very old, see. My

34:54.605 --> 34:57.613
grandmother, and she died over there, and she 
walked. She died before... Before coming here.

35:00.384 --> 35:01.365
Before coming. So she didn't come. No, she didn't 
come. But my grandfather did. And so all of the

35:04.830 --> 35:08.916
brothers and sisters, did they all live together 
when they got here? Oh, yes. They were together.

35:11.099 --> 35:12.261
They were always together. I don't know. In fact, 
my Aunt Josefina and my Tia Lita, they used to live

35:14.124 --> 35:20.833
together until they died. Now, the boys had stores 
and this sort of thing, the brothers. And the

35:26.513 --> 35:29.538
sisters, did they work at all or did they? They 
stayed home. They stayed home. And the brothers

35:32.343 --> 35:35.629
worked and supported the sisters. And none of them 
ever married. No. But they weren't real young when

35:37.332 --> 35:40.358
they came here, were they? Well, I think one was 16. 
One was 16. Matilda, the one that died over there at

35:44.024 --> 35:47.748
the Providence Hospital. And they didn't even 
know what she had, and she had appendix. Maybe your

35:52.934 --> 35:59.902
grandfather may have been born in about 91 and been 
only about 20-something if he was one of the

35:52.934 --> 35:59.902
younger children. My father? Yeah, your father. 
He was born in 1881 because when they made that...

36:08.671 --> 36:14.437
State National Bank was the same, because he used 
to tell me, see, that bank was made when I was born.

36:14.837 --> 36:16.139
That's why I remember that. That's how you 
remember them. Yes. They were old, I'll tell you.

36:19.142 --> 36:19.682
They were old. All right. Then your father, what 
did he do after he married your mother? He was an

36:25.368 --> 36:26.269
engineer. He had mines here in Mexico City, 
Sabinal. Well, this paper says Sabinal. We used to

36:33.436 --> 36:37.260
have mines of gold, plata, and gold and 
everything. But your father, after he came to El

36:37.730 --> 36:43.037
Paso, he couldn't work these mines, did he? Oh, 
yes. He did? He went back to Mexico? Oh, yes. Oh,

36:45.360 --> 36:45.681
yes. My father was going over, coming. And he had a 
partner here, Dr. Hoffner. He had a lot of friends.

36:53.031 --> 36:56.295
And he used to work over in Casas Grandes and his 
mines. We had, I don't know, about 10 or 15 mines. We

37:01.081 --> 37:01.742
had money. I know that we had money. When I was 
small. Because I used to, they used to, we used to

37:04.544 --> 37:11.234
have three cars and chauffeurs and this and that. 
But afterwards... And you lived here in El Paso?

37:13.358 --> 37:15.040
Oh, yes. And he kept on working as an engineer. Now, 
during the first days of the revolution, what year

37:17.885 --> 37:22.131
were you born? In 1921. In 1921. Was he already 
going back to Mexico to work in the mines? Oh yes, my

37:28.027 --> 37:29.148
father, yes. He went all along, all through the 
revolution. Yes. Was he ever in danger or

37:31.671 --> 37:33.353
anything? No, I don't think so. My father, he used 
to come and go and nothing happened to him. But he

37:41.602 --> 37:46.127
never used to go near his ranches or things, no. He 
just never did go near those ranches. No. He used to

37:49.827 --> 37:56.005
write like that, like that, asking for somebody 
would go and see about him. But he never went back.

37:57.570 --> 38:00.117
Who did your grandfather leave in charge of the 
ranches? Well, the ones that they have over there,

38:00.400 --> 38:03.747
the peones or... Yes, overseers. I think he left 
overseers. And then he gave, I think, what I

38:07.033 --> 38:10.760
gather, he gave them power of attorney. And all 
they had to do was, after the harvest, after

38:12.003 --> 38:20.800
everything was sold, they would keep part in St. 
Paul. St. Paul, here to El Paso. It was every other

38:22.844 --> 38:25.187
year they did.

38:28.411 --> 38:33.498
After a while, they quit sending anything. They 
were just complaining of having bad years. Bad

38:36.983 --> 38:39.005
years that went after another, went after 
another. They just never heard from them again.

38:42.950 --> 38:43.772
They just took over. They probably got papers on 
the line or something like that. Claimed them.

38:52.612 --> 38:55.015
There are all kinds of things I want to ask you in a 
minute. I'll go ahead with your family. Now, your

38:59.801 --> 39:03.226
father continued going back to Mexico. And how 
many children did your mother and father have?

39:05.809 --> 39:06.189
Three of us. There were three of you. Who was the 
oldest? Mario. My brother Mario. Mario? Four of

39:11.236 --> 39:11.536
us. Did he marry? Oh, yes. Who did he marry? Berta 
Chapone. From here? Yes, ma'am.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.342
And they had how many? I have a doctor. That's 
Mario.

39:35.331 --> 39:37.474
Just tell me what they do, as you name them. Mario, 
he's a doctor. Mario, a doctor. Tito, he's an

39:43.240 --> 39:46.163
electronics. No, I think he's in computer 
analysis. That's right. Where does he live?

41:58.285 --> 42:02.391
trip, she met this guy in Mexico. Zacatecas, was 
it? I don't know. So they came over. She got married

That's what they told me. I don't know. He was

42:21.456 --> 42:25.882
already over there marrying, and they were living 
here in Los Angeles. And then my sister said, you

42:26.723 --> 42:31.349
better go to your land and leave me alone. Mm-hmm. 
Then she got married with Benny Fregoso. And they

42:34.527 --> 42:37.092
had four children. Oh, they had four children.

43:25.009 --> 43:25.712
old man. He was older than her. And then she married 
again. Yeah. Then she married again. She divorced

43:31.309 --> 43:31.971
me. Then she married again. That's what I heard. I 
don't know if it's true or not. Oh, you don't know

43:35.063 --> 43:35.884
her. That's what your brother told us. Yeah, 
that's what he told me. But you don't know her third

43:38.267 --> 43:40.069
husband? No, I don't know her third, nor her 
fourth. Nor her fourth. You don't even know if she

43:44.234 --> 43:45.876
had any children. No, I don't think so. Because 
she's older than I am. I don't think so. The

43:50.903 --> 43:51.644
children with her? Oh, yes. Then there's you. No, 
yes. Us. And you're married to... Excuse me. I

44:04.968 --> 44:18.263
have the same thing as her grandpa, but I never use 
it because I don't like it. What do you call

44:18.303 --> 44:19.284
yourself? Jesus.

44:22.527 --> 44:25.090
Oh, Jesus Maria. You don't mind Jesus, but you 
don't like to be Maria. Jesus Maria.

44:32.947 --> 44:35.109
All right, and you have how many children? Nine. My 
goodness.

44:40.395 --> 44:43.379
And three in this carriage. I better make a new page 
for your children. And

44:45.962 --> 44:54.671
this tape is just about to run out. Before I go on. 
With your children, let's see, there was one more

44:56.437 --> 45:00.361
question I think I wanted to ask. Oh, your father 
and mother, how long did they, when did they die? My

45:06.688 --> 45:09.391
mother was the one that died in 1932. And my father 
died in 1945. And

45:13.736 --> 45:20.503
what year did you marry? 1945. 1945. November the 
25th. And you met here in El Paso? Oh, yes. And was

45:29.413 --> 45:33.318
your father, did he remain wealthy as long as you 
were at home? You said you remember being wealthy.

45:35.461 --> 45:37.804
Well, because on account of his work. And the three 
cars and everything? Yeah, on account of his work.

45:40.728 --> 45:42.590
But afterwards, something went wrong. My mother 
died, and everything went wrong for my father. His

45:47.396 --> 45:49.579
mines and everything started... But he was always 
busy making maps and this and that. Did he stop

45:57.344 --> 45:59.849
going back to Mexico after your mother died? He 
still went back, but the mines just didn't work out

45:59.949 --> 46:07.804
as well.
