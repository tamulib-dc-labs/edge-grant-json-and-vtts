WEBVTT

00:03.372 --> 00:04.053
Oh, yeah. Those things were applied to a lot of the 
professors. What was your major and why? Ag

00:10.081 --> 00:10.822
economics. I started doing this lecture planning 
here. And I found out pretty quick that my

00:15.629 --> 00:20.896
background in math wasn't strong enough to do 
that. So, in fact, the first semester I hadn't made

00:20.916 --> 00:27.005
a B in B.E.O. and I had my ten hours until grade 
points to stay in. So I changed over to ag

00:30.322 --> 00:32.644
economics. I had a rural farm background anyway. 
And I enjoyed it. What did you think you were

00:39.131 --> 00:41.233
preparing to do? I had no earthly idea. Why did you 
go to college in the first place? Well, because

00:47.960 --> 00:59.451
when I was in high school, getting up at 4.30 in the 
morning and going and milking them darn cows

00:47.960 --> 00:59.451
before I went to school wasn't the thing I wanted to 
do all my life. Your parents encouraged you? Yes.

01:04.713 --> 01:08.157
Do you remember about what it cost a year to go? I 
have, still have, some receipts. And it seemed

01:12.023 --> 01:21.996
like a room and board

01:12.023 --> 01:21.996
was about thirty something dollars. I don't know 
where that was, a month or a semester. I'm not sure.

01:28.652 --> 01:33.938
But I've still got the receipts back in my old... 
Did you have a job on campus? I worked part-time.

01:35.500 --> 01:36.741
Where? I worked some in the mess hall. And then I got 
a job with one of the office supply guys there in

01:39.344 --> 01:47.073
town. Selling office supplies out over the 
country, you know, making food, fixing the dining

01:47.834 --> 01:54.582
box and places like that, and snow. That wasn't 
much of a sale. That didn't last too long. In

02:00.698 --> 02:04.082
Ag-ECO, were there, remember any special 
teachers?

02:07.105 --> 02:08.426
Dan Russell, do you have him? Dr. Dan, the grade 
point man? I believe I did. I believe I did.

02:16.014 --> 02:23.202
And I'm sure, I've said it long enough, I can 
probably recall

02:16.014 --> 02:23.202
some of them. Let's see, let's digress on where did 
all the veterans and their wives live? Well, a lot

02:31.776 --> 02:50.623
of the veterans lived in a new area across the North 
Gate, and there were apartments east

02:31.776 --> 02:50.623
of there that a lot of the veterans lived with 
wives. And did they change the atmosphere in the

02:52.190 --> 02:55.894
classroom? I don't think so. My freshman year, we 
had gotten very, very few veterans. My sophomore

03:03.843 --> 03:07.727
and junior year, they began to get quite few. But 
I'm assuming that they were serious, determined.

03:11.992 --> 03:21.623
Well, some were, and some were joined right in with 
us with a couple of them. Let's see. Activities.

03:25.084 --> 03:27.847
What role did the YMCA building play? What 
happened over there?

03:35.655 --> 03:39.959
I really never went there.

03:39.979 --> 03:41.741
I don't know that I... Guyon Hall? Guyon Hall was 
our theater. Our movie house.

03:50.669 --> 03:51.390
All of their... PE and stuff like that or 
intramurals was, I guess it was all right there on

03:53.395 --> 04:03.749
the east campus. Didn't have anything gross on the 
street at that time for intramurals. The old real

04:08.215 --> 04:14.022
field review was probably

04:08.215 --> 04:14.022
the best. One thing that in final review,

04:14.042 --> 04:22.153
but I don't know when they quit this practice, When 
we were freshmen, we had a fish trap on our farm. And

04:28.976 --> 04:37.247
that was the time you got to pull your fish trap off, 
or if you were a search bug, for instance, you got to

04:28.976 --> 04:37.247
take right off your hip. All those kind of things. I 
don't know whether to do that now or not, but I went

04:39.169 --> 04:47.060
back and some of my old memorabilia, I had some of 
those things. And I give a display to the Corps

04:47.180 --> 04:51.005
Center. It was there for a long time. I don't know if 
it's still there or not. And where did final review

04:54.280 --> 04:55.882
take place? It was the old real field. Do you 
remember your final review? No, my final review,

05:02.928 --> 05:09.315
let me tell you, my final review, I didn't even get a 
stay for graduation. My father had had a heart

05:09.415 --> 05:22.127
attack, and I had to leave, and I graduated in 
December,

05:09.415 --> 05:22.127
or January when it was, instead of fall term. And I 
had to leave about eight or ten days before my

05:22.799 --> 05:28.929
graduation to go back out and take over the 
business. So you didn't get to have that? No, they

05:30.511 --> 05:31.954
just sent me another problem. I didn't even get to 
graduate. Before your own commencement, did you

05:34.438 --> 05:38.685
go to other graduation ceremonies? I don't 
remember any. Were there any famous visitors to

05:42.571 --> 05:47.659
the campus that you remember during your student 
days? Yeah, but I couldn't recall anything. But we

05:52.940 --> 06:01.973
had to know for our junior prom and senior ring 
dance and things like that. We had people like

06:01.993 --> 06:11.307
Sandy Kate, Darce Day, Bob Hope came to campus one 
time. That's when the Aggieland Inn was on campus.

06:14.622 --> 06:22.454
I know I was working that day and I had to assist 
Doris Day with her bags after her run. I thought, my

06:22.474 --> 06:27.742
gosh, she's the most freckle-faced woman I ever 
saw in my life. Of course, you don't see that on the

06:28.443 --> 06:29.806
stage. Any important politicians, governors, 
presidents, generals? We had a lot of military

06:39.120 --> 06:43.026
people. And I'm sure we had some governors come, 
but in that day and time it really impressed me that

06:44.575 --> 06:51.265
much. Uh, religious activities during your 
student days? Yeah, I belonged to the

06:53.789 --> 07:05.486
church there at Northgate, the Baptist church. 
And they had several social activities for those

07:05.506 --> 07:10.133
Aggies. Did you Aggies go to Sunday service? Yeah, 
most of us. Was there religious emphasis week

07:16.176 --> 07:18.058
then? I don't know. I don't remember. That was 
going on when I got there. It would be a week in the

07:24.465 --> 07:30.150
spring and we'd have a speaker in Guyon Hall and so 
forth. I'm sure it probably was, but I just don't

07:30.170 --> 07:31.992
remember. All right, let's talk about the 
diversity. Basically, in terms of religious

07:36.156 --> 07:41.802
preference, the student body was what? I'd say it 
was generally majority Protestant. Did you have

07:47.693 --> 07:49.975
any Catholic friends, acquaintances? Yes. Were 
there any Jewish students? Not a whole lot. There

07:57.523 --> 08:00.566
might have been a few, but not a lot. Any 
international students or any students who came

08:01.126 --> 08:06.632
from some other... Not like it is now. You know, we 
might have had...

08:19.177 --> 08:24.884
We might have had, you know, a sprinkling of 
students from Mexico.

08:26.947 --> 08:29.209
Were they treated differently? No. Not that I can 
remember. And where did they live? Were they part

08:34.616 --> 08:35.597
of the... They were part of the Corps and 
everything else. Do you remember anybody who

08:38.861 --> 08:42.085
seemed unusually rich? No, and that's one thing I 
liked about any of them. If they were... Enlarge on

08:46.451 --> 08:48.373
that point. Well, if somebody came to A&M and had a 
million dollars in their back pocket, they didn't

08:48.674 --> 08:57.545
have a penny in their pocket. They were still all on 
the same level. Everybody respected everybody,

09:00.408 --> 09:08.317
and it wasn't the amount of money you had to make 
your chance in life at A&M. It was a lot of other

09:08.337 --> 09:10.480
things. And, you know, I really liked that. Did it 
matter where you came from geographically? No, it

09:15.686 --> 09:17.348
sure didn't. As you look back on it, was the 
leadership composed of any certain segment of the

09:17.952 --> 09:27.783
student body?

09:31.307 --> 09:39.897
Well, you know, I mean, like your class officers 
were basically pretty popular. No, but I mean, to

09:39.917 --> 09:44.942
be one of those, did you have to be from a certain 
place or a certain major? No. I don't know. And how

09:50.418 --> 09:56.984
many do you think of your associates were from 
college educated parents?

10:00.527 --> 10:12.017
I'd say that there was, it'd

10:00.527 --> 10:12.017
be a rough guess, but I would be thinking it'd be 
less than good to be honest. My parents weren't.

10:13.859 --> 10:16.461
I'll bet that's a safe guess. Let's see, what did 
these veterans' wives do? They couldn't go to

10:20.991 --> 10:25.275
class, except in the summer, so what did they do? A 
lot of them worked as secretaries and things like

10:26.096 --> 10:29.259
that.

10:33.023 --> 10:35.426
And a lot of them were just housewives, I guess. Did 
these veterans cause any changes in campus

10:35.806 --> 10:38.949
traditions? None that I know of. They were a little 
reluctant, of course, to walk in the gutter and

10:42.153 --> 10:47.258
say, I didn't have a freshman, but... You know, 
other than a few things like that, I think they

10:47.795 --> 10:53.844
respect

10:47.795 --> 10:53.844
the tradition. Let's see, we talked about 
hitchhiking. Did you ever much ride the train or

10:55.947 --> 10:59.032
the bus? Yes. Describe those experiences. I rode 
the train, catch the train in Little Hill, Texas,

11:02.738 --> 11:11.291
which is 20 miles from Springwood, and ride to 
Covey Station on the train. What? What route was

11:12.415 --> 11:13.416
that? Gosh, I don't know. Did you change? I think we 
changed. It was Santa Fe, the left Littlefield.

11:20.805 --> 11:21.365
And I don't know. What is that line, Joseph? I'm not 
sure. I think it used to be Southern Pacific. Yeah,

11:28.374 --> 11:29.875
I don't think it was Santa Fe. So we had to change 
somewhere. But, yeah, we've done that many times.

11:36.343 --> 11:36.643
Bus. Occasionally we'd take the bus. Where did you 
catch it? You can catch the bus in Littleville too.

11:44.135 --> 11:46.477
No, but then in College Station if you want. Oh, it 
seemed to me like there was a place up in Northgate

11:46.497 --> 11:54.085
where you caught the bus. Let's see. On El Campus, 
where did an Aggie get a date? Well,

11:59.330 --> 12:11.042
that's kind of a funny thing, but when we had our 
court trips to Fort Worth and to Dallas, we'd try to

12:11.714 --> 12:21.322
contact some Tessies, students from TSC 
Kentucky, which then was a normal female school.

12:21.342 --> 12:31.511
And on numerous occasions, we'd write this 
student a box with a box number and write a letter,

12:21.342 --> 12:31.511
and you'd be surprised how many blind dates you 
could pick up that way. But other than that, there

12:32.272 --> 12:41.620
wasn't a lot of women around Bryan College 
Stationery for dating, and we really didn't. Did

12:42.224 --> 12:52.634
you or any of your buddies ever have any 
interesting test seat blind date experiences you

12:42.224 --> 12:52.634
can share? We've had some. I've had some. I can't 
remember. One of my good buddies, Bill Burrow,

12:58.560 --> 13:07.209
finally married one that he blind dated. Describe 
a court trip weekend. Well,

13:12.245 --> 13:33.257
it alternated Fort Worth one year to Dallas the 
next year, and the whole Corps would go up and march

13:12.245 --> 13:33.257
in the town before the game that morning, or before 
that afternoon. How'd you get there? Well, most of

13:36.021 --> 13:39.266
us had shacks. And you spent the night? And 
tonight, you know, we'd bundle up a bunch of us in a

13:40.409 --> 13:48.119
hotel room and stuff like that. Anything ever 
happen on Saturday night? Well, we had our

13:52.104 --> 13:55.829
midnight yell practices there, wherever we were, 
we had them. And, oh, there's a few fisticuffs

13:56.971 --> 14:03.700
around town, things like that, but not anything 
extraordinary. In general, how were the dates

14:03.720 --> 14:09.167
treated?

14:11.223 --> 14:20.633
I don't know what you mean by that, but I think an 
Aggie is a gentleman, and the women they dated,

14:11.223 --> 14:20.633
they were treated very properly. That's the 
direction I was assuming. And what was expected

14:23.657 --> 14:33.087
that the Aggie would do for his date that weekend? 
Well, he was just kind of, if it was a date that they

14:33.107 --> 14:40.015
had out of town to come in, They would be

14:40.653 --> 14:55.515
as an escort to do different affairs and things and 
take them to all the festivities. Would there be a

14:55.875 --> 14:57.998
dance that night? Sometimes there wasn't, 
sometimes there wasn't. And then y'all would come

15:01.103 --> 15:04.608
home about Sunday morning? Yeah, start trickling 
in on Sunday morning. And then also went to Houston

15:08.345 --> 15:13.813
and Austin. Of the court trip. I don't remember 
coming to Austin. Oh, y'all didn't do it? I don't

15:17.558 --> 15:18.599
think we did. Oh, okay. No, that's right. And 
didn't do court trips to Waco. No.

15:30.656 --> 15:34.521
When you came home, were you kind of worn out after a 
court trip weekend? Oh, young Buck, him days don't

15:34.855 --> 15:38.278
get worn out. I wish I had the energy now. I did then. 
Let's see. Special social events at College

15:42.582 --> 15:45.945
Station. What were they? Well, some of the dances I 
mentioned to you a moment

15:46.926 --> 15:52.351
ago. And it was very special when you'd have a date 
come into town for a football weekend. Because

15:59.217 --> 16:04.322
there was always something going on other than 
football. I don't guess there's near as many

16:06.563 --> 16:11.070
special occasions as there are now on campus.

16:14.255 --> 16:17.300
The same way the student programs. We had very few 
clubs and student programs we participated in

16:17.320 --> 16:22.088
those days. Now there's over seven of them, which I 
think is wonderful for a degree. All right, you're

16:27.843 --> 16:29.665
now a senior. What were the big social events of 
being a senior? I guess you look forward to the

16:33.189 --> 16:37.334
senior ring dance, but not much of anything. Boot 
bags? Well, that's basically the same thing. Oh,

16:41.479 --> 16:43.181
okay, okay. Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right. And that 
would have been held where? We used to have it in

16:47.806 --> 16:50.369
Subesa. And how was a young lady treated? How did 
she dress and so forth? That was kind

16:57.762 --> 17:07.937
of an obligation for a young lady

16:57.762 --> 17:07.937
to be farmer. Let's see, did you ever have, did you 
have a car while you were a student? I did my last, I

17:11.322 --> 17:18.572
think last semester or two, I bought an old record 
car. And that day you could buy an old car for $50.

17:23.251 --> 17:24.713
Oh, I see what you meant by record. Yeah. It's an old 
model. I think I bought an old 32 model Chevrolet.

17:33.826 --> 17:35.969
And so you finish in what year? In January of 1950. 
Okay, so you... Now, just before I finished that

17:37.671 --> 17:44.401
last semester, my father did buy me a car. As a kind 
of a graduation present. Let's see... You're on

17:50.193 --> 17:52.495
the main campus now. Where did you go off campus for 
a good time? Well,

17:58.261 --> 18:13.536
I remember one evening when the battalion came 
out, it had an article in it about the girls in

17:58.261 --> 18:13.536
Temple, Texas that formed the Nagyette Club. And 
the whole purpose was it was when Nagy's came into

18:13.556 --> 18:17.500
town, they'd get on blind dates. So me and my 
roommate that afternoon, when that battalion

18:19.015 --> 18:23.721
came out, we went to Temple.

18:27.365 --> 18:34.313
Tried out the situation, and

18:27.365 --> 18:34.313
it worked. Well, the following two or three 
weekends, one of my roommates and I started

18:34.333 --> 18:44.705
Temple. He was a big tall guy from Olsen, Texas. And 
we had called the Aggie head president to get us

18:46.690 --> 18:52.038
dates. And they did. And we talked to them on the 
phone before we got there. And Buddy being much

18:57.145 --> 19:01.812
taller than I was, one of these girls was quite a bit 
taller than the other. And so I had a date with a

19:01.832 --> 19:03.555
taller girl. He had a date with a shorter one. So we 
switched and told them why. It didn't make any

19:09.904 --> 19:12.207
difference to them. But ironically, the girl I 
wound up with, the shorter one, I finally married.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.934
So that's how you met through? That's how I met my 
wife. Aggie Et Club. Uh-huh, in Temple, Texas. Now

19:24.380 --> 19:30.549
these Aggie Et dates were in high school or college 
age? They were seniors in high school and junior

19:31.971 --> 19:41.646
college there and business college there in 
Temple. Were there Aggie Et Clubs anywhere else? I

19:44.290 --> 19:44.811
don't know that. I've never, see you just added a 
new breadth, I've not heard of that before.

19:50.354 --> 19:55.742
Alright, so you meet her that way, and you're what 
year in school? This is my senior year. Okay, and so

19:57.204 --> 20:00.408
you began to go to Temple more often then. Okay, 
when she came to College Station, where would

20:01.410 --> 20:06.237
y'all go? I don't know that she ever came to College 
Station. Alright, did an Aggie go to the movie

20:10.282 --> 20:13.026
much? And if so, where? Well, like I said, we went to 
Cannon Hall a lot. There wasn't much other. I think

20:21.117 --> 20:25.704
there was one movie, North Campus, I mean 
Northgate. But we didn't go to them. Can you

20:30.372 --> 20:33.557
describe Northgate, what was out there? Well, the 
Dixie Chicken wasn't out there then. It was just,

20:38.545 --> 20:40.448
you know, a... Lupo had his bookstore on the corner 
and then he had several little businesses if you

20:42.470 --> 20:52.144
went on down to where the theater was. And it seemed 
to me like across the street east of Lupo's there

20:53.286 --> 21:03.321
was a couple of little businesses and a gas station 
and that was about it then. Did you, were you

21:04.022 --> 21:07.347
students aware of Mr. Lupo? Oh yes, I knew him well. 
Please describe Mr. LePore. Well, he was a great

21:12.083 --> 21:13.685
actor. He was kind of like a Pinky Downs almost. And 
was a great booster of A&M. He helped many of the

21:20.355 --> 21:21.637
students. How? You know, some students come to A&M 
that didn't have a diamond scratcher. And if they

21:29.108 --> 21:35.017
needed help with books and things, he'd make 
provisions where they could get books and take

21:29.108 --> 21:35.017
care of them later. Things like that. He was just a 
He just believed in A&M 200%. Was he sincere? Oh,

21:42.042 --> 21:42.983
absolutely. He really was. And were his

21:44.705 --> 21:52.233
business practices fair and honest? As far as I 
know, I never heard anybody complain. Describe

21:55.277 --> 21:56.458
Mr. Lupo. Well, he was a guy about my size, maybe a 
little heavier weight, and he was always in a

21:57.499 --> 22:06.949
talented mood. That's really about as much as I 
remember about it individually. And did you and

22:14.215 --> 22:17.720
other students buy books and things from him? Yes. 
Pinky Downs, who was he? Pinky Downs was a little

22:21.425 --> 22:27.774
waggy promoter from way back. I've got what class 
Pinky was in, but I mean, he never missed a football

22:32.326 --> 22:35.050
game. He never missed a baseball or basketball 
game. He was all T.L. practices. And everybody

22:39.997 --> 22:46.626
thought of Pete Downs as one of the greatest 
O'Lakes. And what did he do on campus? Well, he was

22:49.570 --> 22:53.455
basically just a PR person, I guess. I mean, he was 
top, top in A&M everywhere, any chance he had.

23:00.254 --> 23:02.496
because he was still there when I got there in 59. 
And the first time I saw Lupo was at a football

23:03.417 --> 23:14.809
scrimmage game, and here came this guy in a little 
late, yelling, gig'em, gig'em, gig'em, and I

23:03.417 --> 23:14.809
wondered, who in the world is that guy? You know, 
Pinky Downs reminds me of a whole lot of, oh

23:15.409 --> 23:29.063
gosh, I'm proud to thank the guys associated with 
the football team now that does all the, keeps all

23:15.409 --> 23:29.063
the, materials together, suits and things. Billy 
Pickard. Oh. Pinky Downs was a whole lot like Billy

23:33.774 --> 23:36.617
Pickard. Or Billy Pickard was a lot like Pinky 
Downs. Let's see. No, there were no campus

23:42.844 --> 23:50.913
incidents, no fires, no bombings, no during your 
time, whatever? Do you remember any unusual? I

23:53.576 --> 23:57.801
don't remember anything other than that March on 
Gilchrist Town. All right. Gilchrist is

23:58.988 --> 24:00.650
president when you get there. Is he president 
throughout your?

24:05.398 --> 24:08.022
No, I don't remember. I flatly don't remember. And 
you didn't go across the stage at commencement, so

24:08.542 --> 24:11.888
you don't remember who? No. So you got your diploma 
through the mail? They sent it to me through the

24:14.732 --> 24:17.536
mail. And did y'all worry much about grade point 
ratios? Well, the only thing you had to worry about

24:22.724 --> 24:27.231
then was you had to have a 10-10 stand. 10 grade 
points and 10 hours. But I found out myself, those

24:33.236 --> 24:41.328
first few semesters were the hardest. Because 
after that, in our day and time, we could take as

24:41.348 --> 24:47.638
many hours as we wanted to. I put 23 hours on my 
semester. And after my first two semesters, I made

24:49.801 --> 24:55.429
A's and B's and a few sprinkles C's. and never 
studied half as much. It was just getting

24:57.806 --> 25:01.591
acclimatized to a routine and procedure. And in a 
typical weekday, how many of those hours were you

25:03.053 --> 25:11.805
on the campus? All the time.

25:17.193 --> 25:18.875
So you were totally immersed. Yeah. Let's see, do 
you remember any international events during

25:20.789 --> 25:33.020
that time that caused you to kind of stop and pause 
and think about what it might mean? Well, the war

25:35.423 --> 25:44.992
was over, but I think that happened just before my 
draft board told me that I could go into college. It

25:45.953 --> 25:48.535
didn't where I would be able to continue or where 
I'd be drafted in that first semester. And I went

25:52.174 --> 25:56.519
ahead and went, and then the war was over, it 
cleared over. And the draft then, the Nikes don't

25:56.539 --> 26:02.306
think we're going to college, and things like 
that. And of course, that was a very memorable

26:02.326 --> 26:15.602
occasion, when Harris-Hammond,

26:02.326 --> 26:15.602
Thomas Hockey, or whatever it is, was bombed with 
an atomic bomb. And you graduate in December or

26:16.477 --> 26:24.165
January of 1950, so before the Korean War. A lot of 
my, most of it. The reason I didn't go to the Korean

26:27.048 --> 26:32.914
War was because my father was an architect and he 
happened to assume the farming business. But a lot

26:33.674 --> 26:40.181
of my buddies, I guess the majority of them, did go 
to the Korean War.

26:40.902 --> 26:43.925
Most popular student indulgences of the time. 
What did y'all... I don't know. I like different

26:49.724 --> 26:50.564
things. Did anybody drink any beer in those days? 
When they get to Anfield. Where?

26:57.852 --> 27:09.283
There was a place that, a couple places at 
Eastgate, that's heard there. There were places

27:09.303 --> 27:16.470
over going into Bryan, the old Triangle. We used to 
serve beer. There wasn't a whole lot, but there

27:19.360 --> 27:23.846
were several. What were the most popular brands 
for an idea? Gosh, I don't know. I don't remember at

27:29.473 --> 27:30.374
all. Beer was beer then. And whiskey? Whiskey was 
always obtained from across the river at the

27:35.340 --> 27:39.606
bridge. What about smoking? You know, it didn't 
seem to me like... Smoking was as popular then as it

27:47.095 --> 27:51.902
had gotten after then. And what brands did the 
folks smoke? Well, Chesterfields and Campbells.

27:59.153 --> 28:05.242
Lucky Strike Green had gone to war, so it was Lucky 
Strike White. Cigars? Very few cigars. Snuff?

28:09.709 --> 28:10.330
Chewing tobacco? There were a few of the guys that 
chewed with tobacco. We mentioned hard lickers.

28:19.970 --> 28:25.557
Was there any house of ill repute?

28:28.820 --> 28:33.566
Well, of course, there was the chicken ranch, 
which is not too far because there's no other

28:28.820 --> 28:33.566
ranch. But right around there, I don't know it. Did 
you ever hear of the chicken ranch in those days?

28:40.794 --> 28:44.178
Yeah, I think most Aggies heard it. I don't know. 
Did you know of any Aggies that... admitted they'd

28:46.360 --> 28:47.421
been there? No.

28:52.648 --> 28:53.148
Let's see. Once you got that car, did anybody ever 
borrow it or try to borrow it? No, but I sure had a lot

29:01.859 --> 29:05.363
of people ride, more drives. Normally when you 
gave somebody a ride out of town, what was the

29:06.445 --> 29:11.591
routine about the expenses? They'd share the gas.

29:16.735 --> 29:27.032
And if you had any money and you were going to really 
splurge, what did an Aggie spend his money on?

29:27.052 --> 29:30.297
I don't know in that position. I really don't know. 
There wasn't much money to be splurged at that

29:33.322 --> 29:37.489
time. Okay. Going to play a football game in 
College Station. And this is, you're a junior, a

29:43.280 --> 29:46.024
senior now. Describe that whole weekend. What 
went on and who and where and so forth. Describe the

29:52.031 --> 29:53.714
football weekend. Well, it was a whole weekend. I 
guess the football game was a climax.

30:05.329 --> 30:11.717
But leading up to the Y'all's Mid-Nine Hill 
practices was... were really inspired. They

30:13.183 --> 30:14.264
wasn't near the Grouse. Where were they held? 
Where were the Yale practice held? You know, it

30:18.167 --> 30:22.491
seemed to me like we used to have in the new area, but 
I'm not sure. Or are we dead out there on that old

30:23.392 --> 30:30.859
drill field behind Duncan Hall? I don't remember 
doing it in Goff Hill until later years. OK, then

30:36.685 --> 30:40.388
that's Friday night. And who went to midnight Yale 
practice? We all did. Dates? Yeah, yeah. Dates

30:46.525 --> 30:47.326
they went with you. Then Saturday, what time did 
things begin? Well, Saturday began just like a

30:50.930 --> 30:53.753
regular military day. You know, you had your 
practice. Then from after that time until game

30:57.878 --> 31:05.346
time, you kind of went on your own. You know, you got 
ready to do the march-in, which you had to do

31:05.798 --> 31:13.168
earlier for the game against Jordan. And, of 
course, it wasn't as long a march-in then because

31:13.188 --> 31:17.354
it wasn't... Well, I guess they were, too. There 
were just many of them. There weren't more in the

31:18.115 --> 31:19.217
Corps then. There were more. And during the game, 
where were y'all and what'd you do? We stood up all

31:24.844 --> 31:26.827
game. And we humped it for Yale practice, up for our 
Yales.
