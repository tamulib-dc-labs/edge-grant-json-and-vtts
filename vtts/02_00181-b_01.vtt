00:03.203 --> 00:16.032
August 31 testing August 31 to to to to to

00:20.095 --> 00:37.332
This is July the 31st and I have the honor and privilege of chatting with Mr. Bernard Richardson, class of 41, about his experiences at Texas A&M.

00:38.173 --> 00:45.040
Mr. Richardson, to begin and introduce yourself to anyone who might listen to this tape or read the transcript,

00:45.020 --> 00:54.815
describe where you grew up, what your family did for a living, what high school you went to, and so forth.

00:54.835 --> 00:58.221
Well, to start with, my name is Bernard and not Bernard.

00:58.641 --> 01:06.253
I was born in Kirbyville, Texas, which is in Jasper County, about 50 miles north of Beaumont.

01:07.395 --> 01:11.702
My father, DC Richardson, David C. Richardson, was a farmer.

01:12.526 --> 01:19.623
I went to a little country school in the community of Mount Union my first five years.

01:20.324 --> 01:26.519
And then the sixth year, when I was in the sixth grade, I started to go into Kirbyville High School.

01:27.180 --> 01:30.568
I finished Kirbyville High School in 1935.

01:31.072 --> 01:47.715
There was only 43 students in my senior class, and we still have a class reunion every year, and we had our 65th this last year at my farm.

01:49.156 --> 01:56.927
After I finished high school, I was not able to go to college because my family was not able to send me.

01:59.017 --> 02:03.422
I had an older brother who was 17 years older than I was.

02:06.185 --> 02:10.010
He told me if I'd save money that he'd match it.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.596
And I wanted to go to A&M bad.

02:18.079 --> 02:27.049
I got a job working at a filling station seven days a week, 12 hours a day for $5 a week.

02:28.531 --> 02:36.261
I stayed at home and the only expense I had was my Texaco uniforms.

02:36.281 --> 02:40.187
I saved four dollars of every five dollars that I made.

02:40.247 --> 02:49.960
One December, just before Christmas, I was washing, had to wash three dump trucks every Sunday morning.

02:50.821 --> 02:52.463
I was washing those dump trucks

02:52.831 --> 02:57.155
And when I got through, I held the hose with my left hand.

02:57.175 --> 02:58.276
I couldn't turn it loose.

02:58.296 --> 02:58.956
It was frozen.

02:59.937 --> 03:04.021
I went in, told the boss that I was quitting.

03:04.041 --> 03:04.962
Well, I went home.

03:05.662 --> 03:11.728
Monday morning he called me, told me, I'll raise you to $6 a week if you come back.

03:12.929 --> 03:15.030
I went back, glad to go back.

03:16.352 --> 03:19.534
And I worked there for almost a year.

03:20.856 --> 03:22.517
Then the government came along

03:22.987 --> 03:28.612
At that time, they was plowing up cotton, playing people not to raise cotton.

03:29.613 --> 03:37.500
I got a job with the government working six days a week for $3.75 a day.

03:38.721 --> 03:52.032
I worked there for about four months, and my brother told me, son, brother, you've either got to go to college or I'm going to call my deal off because you're about to break me.

03:53.362 --> 04:01.555
Well, at the end, about four months, then I had enough money to register at A&M.

04:05.461 --> 04:09.006
What caused you to be, what did you know about A&M?

04:09.026 --> 04:10.629
What led your interest to A&M?

04:11.811 --> 04:20.905
Just following the sports, in the newspaper, Bowman Enterprise.

04:22.522 --> 04:40.362
I'd always wanted to go to A&M and I had played basketball in Kirbyville and when I went to A&M there was two boys from my hometown already there and I as a freshman had to go two days before they did.

04:41.337 --> 04:44.283
I got there in September of 37.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.411
How did you travel over there that first time?

04:48.431 --> 04:50.456
My sister carried me.

04:50.636 --> 04:59.093
My sister, who was several years older than I was, and she had a job, and she had a car, and she carried me, dumped me off at Puryear Hall.

04:59.950 --> 05:09.840
And I was there two days, didn't know a soul, and had to meet the first, my first sergeant met me, and his name was Polanovich.

05:09.940 --> 05:13.724
I'd never heard of anybody by that name.

05:14.685 --> 05:24.895
And he told me, he says, now, Fish Richardson, you are expected to know everybody in the company after a week and know their names and what town they're from.

05:25.685 --> 05:27.127
Well, I was kind of stunned.

05:27.768 --> 05:32.456
I had a Lefkowski, Polanovich, and I had about four more Polacks that I didn't have.

05:33.077 --> 05:34.800
In Jasper County, there wasn't any.

05:35.601 --> 05:38.406
I didn't know how I was ever going to learn to pronounce those names.

05:39.908 --> 05:45.437
Well, about the second day I was there, the two other students from Kirbyville arrived.

05:45.958 --> 05:51.928
I was sitting on the corner of Puryear waiting for them to come in because I knew they was going to be in the same dorm.

05:53.495 --> 05:59.182
When they got there, they came by and they said, Hi, Fitz Richland, and just kept going.

05:59.763 --> 06:07.592
I was never so disappointed in my life to think that they wouldn't even talk to me.

06:09.394 --> 06:13.479
Well, it wasn't long until I saw them again.

06:13.539 --> 06:18.405
They were friendly, and we were friendly all the way through.

06:19.533 --> 06:24.058
I was taking petroleum engineering and mechanical engineering, a five-year course.

06:24.658 --> 06:29.603
How much of that money did you, that you earned, how much did you bring with you to College Station?

06:29.924 --> 06:30.725
I didn't bring any.

06:32.567 --> 06:35.590
I had registered, already registered, and I didn't have any money left.

06:35.990 --> 06:38.313
Oh, do you remember what that first year cost?

06:38.393 --> 06:39.474
No, sir, I do not.

06:39.754 --> 06:40.795
Did your brother match?

06:41.195 --> 06:41.996
Did he keep his?

06:42.477 --> 06:44.119
Yes, sir, he kept it, and he matched.

06:44.499 --> 06:48.443
But, of course, I didn't earn any after that, that he matched.

06:48.862 --> 06:50.785
Describe the campus.

06:50.805 --> 06:53.150
What did it look like when you got there?

06:54.031 --> 06:57.758
Well, I came from Kirbyville, which was a population of a thousand.

06:58.639 --> 07:01.304
So College Station was a big town.

07:01.945 --> 07:03.267
The buildings were big to me.

07:04.109 --> 07:05.892
And everything was strange.

07:06.693 --> 07:10.179
And I didn't know how I was going to get along.

07:10.921 --> 07:12.203
But I managed.

07:12.622 --> 07:19.336
And I hadn't been there long until I got a job setting pins in the bowling alley.

07:20.298 --> 07:21.962
And that was kind of an experience.

07:23.104 --> 07:24.247
That was in the YMCA?

07:24.307 --> 07:26.973
In the YMCA, Mr. Cashin was running it.

07:27.454 --> 07:28.977
Describe Mr. Cashin.

07:28.957 --> 07:33.362
Well, he was a kind of jolly fellow and very friendly.

07:34.303 --> 07:36.966
And I was setting pins one day.

07:37.506 --> 07:40.610
Back those days, there was no mechanical setting.

07:40.630 --> 07:43.853
I had to set the pins down and then push them down.

07:44.814 --> 07:55.926
I was working one day and the fellow bowling and the pins flew out of the, off the alley and up behind me.

07:56.227 --> 08:00.672
And Mr. Cashin was down there almost time the bowling ball was.

08:00.692 --> 08:02.474
But I wasn't hurt.

08:02.494 --> 08:11.504
And after that, I got a job taking up cleaning impressions for Hollick cleaners.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.926
And besides that, I had a candy concession.

08:14.667 --> 08:17.170
And the candy concession was on the honor system.

08:17.610 --> 08:20.894
I had a table out in the hall, in Puryear Hall, ramp one.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.837
And I put the candy out there.

08:24.188 --> 08:28.734
And people come by and either paid for the candy, put the money in, or put an IOU.

08:29.715 --> 08:32.158
And I never lost any money on IOU.

08:32.719 --> 08:33.620
Everybody paid.

08:34.581 --> 08:43.512
And then the last two years that I was there, I worked for the school, I don't know, it's got a name, W-something.

08:43.532 --> 08:48.579
Anyway, I made 25 cents an hour down at the Petroleum Building.

08:48.599 --> 08:52.103
And I painted that fence around the...

08:53.703 --> 08:57.308
where they had the oil rigs that we worked on.

08:57.829 --> 09:03.617
I painted that fence about three times with a one-inch brush with silver paint.

09:03.637 --> 09:06.561
And I managed to get through.

09:06.581 --> 09:16.234
And when I got through A&M, I only owed my brother $1,700 is all I owed him that he had loaned me after I got in school.

09:18.597 --> 09:23.524
Describe your unit, your outfit, and how you as a fish were built.

09:23.858 --> 09:25.099
broken into that unit?

09:25.480 --> 09:28.403
I was in Battery D of the Coast Artillery.

09:28.623 --> 09:29.624
Did y'all have a nickname?

09:30.425 --> 09:30.685
No.

09:31.566 --> 09:36.631
And as a freshman, we had to clean up upperclassmen's rooms.

09:37.271 --> 09:44.158
And when I first got there, we had the upperclassmen made us wash and paint the walls of the dormitories.

09:45.019 --> 09:48.763
And back in those days, they used the board.

09:49.804 --> 09:52.026
And I got my share of the board.

09:52.867 --> 10:01.868
I was, my freshman year, I cleaned up room for Charles Kirkpatrick, who was a baseball catcher on the A&M team.

10:01.888 --> 10:03.973
He was a sophomore.

10:03.993 --> 10:05.897
He used the board on me every morning.

10:06.282 --> 10:09.306
if I woke him up or if I didn't wake him up.

10:09.386 --> 10:11.449
So it didn't make any difference.

10:11.469 --> 10:12.150
I enjoyed it.

10:12.851 --> 10:13.592
It wasn't bad.

10:13.632 --> 10:15.374
And that was a good thing.

10:15.474 --> 10:19.479
I served one year and got three years service in return.

10:20.481 --> 10:25.928
And I enjoyed my freshman year as much as I did any year at A&M.

10:25.908 --> 10:28.831
It wasn't all that bad.

10:31.014 --> 10:38.582
Back those days in the engineering course, I took 22 hours one semester and 21 the other semester my freshman year.

10:39.082 --> 10:41.425
Kids don't think about taking that many hours now.

10:42.246 --> 10:47.812
Were there some teachers you had that first year that were special that you remember warmly?

10:49.053 --> 10:51.195
No sir, not particularly.

10:52.317 --> 10:55.560
I was an awful student in English and I remember

10:55.945 --> 11:00.043
English teachers because I didn't pass that freshman year in English.

11:01.229 --> 11:02.555
But they wasn't bad.

11:02.715 --> 11:03.559
I enjoyed them.

11:05.277 --> 11:08.021
Now you started off majoring in petroleum?

11:08.261 --> 11:10.505
Petroleum mechanical engineering.

11:10.585 --> 11:11.687
And stayed with it all?

11:11.747 --> 11:13.549
Stayed with it all the time.

11:13.890 --> 11:20.259
I have my degree, got my degree in petroleum engineering like seven hours having it in mechanical.

11:21.061 --> 11:29.293
And it was a five-year course and at the end of the fifth year I was, I got my commission at the end of my fourth year.

11:29.662 --> 11:35.709
And at the fifth year, I got a year's deferment, and I didn't quite get that year's deferment.

11:35.729 --> 11:44.418
They called me on April the 10th of 1942 to go into service with, of course, I was a commissioned officer.

11:45.519 --> 11:58.453
And when I went into service, I went into service on the 10th of April, and I went to Camp Wallace for two days and then was transferred to Camp Hewlin, and then on the 19th,

11:58.990 --> 12:09.810
I was on a ship going overseas and we went to Ireland and we trained on British guns for six months in Ireland.

12:10.870 --> 12:15.076
Let's go back to that first year at A&M.

12:15.176 --> 12:17.980
Did you have a special roommate, a special fish old lady?

12:18.701 --> 12:20.784
Yes, I had two, A.J.

12:20.864 --> 12:23.047
Prager and Rex Butler.

12:23.087 --> 12:23.728
Spell Prager.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.290
P-R-A-G-E-R.

12:26.152 --> 12:26.572
A.J.

12:26.632 --> 12:30.878
has passed away this past year, and I haven't heard from Rex in several years.

12:32.841 --> 12:35.004
What was special about your friendship?

12:36.286 --> 12:39.190
Well, it was kind of new to me.

12:41.313 --> 12:47.561
Of course, Rex was just an old farm boy, but A.J.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.342
was a little different.

12:48.402 --> 12:48.823
A.J.

12:48.863 --> 12:53.368
was a Jewish boy, and I had never been around a Jew.

12:56.733 --> 12:59.817
We took up a good acquaintance, and A.J.

12:59.837 --> 13:00.538
was good to me.

13:00.558 --> 13:01.038
A.J.

13:01.078 --> 13:02.460
had money, and I didn't.

13:03.217 --> 13:09.766
And the funny thing about it, we'd go somewhere, and if we had to buy a Coke or ice cream cone or something, A.J.

13:09.786 --> 13:12.290
would buy mine, but he wouldn't buy nobody else's.

13:13.952 --> 13:15.574
Did you all have nicknames for each other?

13:16.275 --> 13:18.859
No, not particularly.

13:20.020 --> 13:21.783
Now, you're a Jewish roommate.

13:22.724 --> 13:25.187
How were Jewish boys treated at A&M then?

13:25.928 --> 13:28.532
Very good, very good.

13:31.060 --> 13:34.625
I enjoyed A.J., and I respected him.

13:37.209 --> 13:41.816
Did you all call each other old lady in the Corps then?

13:41.836 --> 13:42.036
Yes.

13:42.116 --> 13:43.679
Your freshman was your old lady?

13:43.919 --> 13:44.580
Yes, we did.

13:45.301 --> 13:52.191
Describe going to the chow hall and what the routine was for a freshman in the chow hall.

13:52.795 --> 14:01.623
Well, we had, of course, line up out in the street, and we marched to Sabisa Hall for every meal.

14:02.584 --> 14:13.335
And in the mess hall, we was, at that time, every freshman was supposed to go his class number days without any kush.

14:13.375 --> 14:14.336
That was dessert.

14:14.596 --> 14:18.740
In other words, we were supposed to go 41 days without any dessert.

14:19.460 --> 14:21.182
And if you got caught,

14:21.162 --> 14:22.404
You had to start over.

14:23.146 --> 14:24.869
You had to go 41 days from there.

14:25.530 --> 14:30.960
Well, I don't think many of us went 41 days without dessert.

14:31.020 --> 14:32.703
We found a way of getting dessert.

14:33.365 --> 14:38.935
Sometimes the upperclassmen would let you have dessert, providing you'd eat a whole pie at one time.

14:38.915 --> 14:42.380
or sometimes they'd let you have a piece of pie if it was a meringue pie.

14:42.920 --> 14:49.349
If you didn't use a fork, you just had to eat it out of the saucer without any utensils.

14:49.369 --> 14:52.053
But we managed, and we stayed late.

14:52.434 --> 14:58.422
The upperclassmen left the mess hall pretty early, and we stayed late, and we managed to eat our kush.

14:59.063 --> 15:04.450
Did you all ever play any tricks on anybody in the dining hall?

15:05.020 --> 15:07.243
Not many in my outfit they didn't.

15:07.263 --> 15:09.706
On some of their others they did, but mine didn't.

15:10.507 --> 15:14.332
A lot of times we had to bring breakfast back to the upperclassmen.

15:14.372 --> 15:23.604
We had to come out of the mess hall with whatever they had for breakfast and bring it to the upperclassmen that didn't go to breakfast, which wasn't many of them.

15:23.624 --> 15:28.310
And did you have to smuggle it under your shirt, or could you just carry it in your hand?

15:29.992 --> 15:32.175
Well, most of the time we had to smuggle it.

15:32.696 --> 15:34.318
Sometimes we could get by with it.

15:35.260 --> 15:38.205
Did y'all have nicknames for the food and the drink?

15:38.225 --> 15:38.866
Oh, yeah.

15:38.886 --> 15:40.108
Everything had a nickname.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.534
Mention some of them, please.

15:43.554 --> 15:53.690
Well, milk was leche, and bread was... Deal?

15:54.492 --> 16:00.762
And pie was, any dessert was kush, and...

16:02.902 --> 16:03.743
Meat.

16:05.726 --> 16:06.507
Bullneck.

16:06.527 --> 16:08.389
Bullneck was the meat.

16:11.333 --> 16:12.274
Well, you got me now.

16:12.314 --> 16:13.015
I'm thinking.

16:19.023 --> 16:21.646
Mustard was baby.

16:22.267 --> 16:24.910
Yeah, well, I got something I wouldn't want to tell.

16:27.370 --> 16:29.993
But everything had a nickname.

16:31.154 --> 16:35.799
When did you begin to realize that you were making some very special friendships?

16:37.481 --> 16:41.365
Oh, I'd say after I'd been there two weeks.

16:43.027 --> 16:44.869
Did you get homesick?

16:44.889 --> 16:46.871
Yes, because I'd never been away from home.

16:48.053 --> 16:50.635
It was my first adventure from home.

16:50.675 --> 16:52.197
Sure I got homesick.

16:52.750 --> 16:58.827
And to my sorry I missed the first Thanksgiving game, I went home.

16:59.469 --> 17:01.034
And I paid dearly for it.

17:01.776 --> 17:08.515
And when I got home, my mother saw my behind and she threatened to not let me go back.

17:10.047 --> 17:13.091
That was, let's see, in 41, the game was in?

17:13.752 --> 17:15.154
Well, that wasn't 537.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.396
Oh, I mean 37.

17:16.616 --> 17:18.038
The game was in Austin?

17:18.058 --> 17:22.144
I think so, yes.

17:22.665 --> 17:25.910
Now, how did you get back and forth to home?

17:25.930 --> 17:26.971
Oh, you hitchhiked.

17:26.991 --> 17:35.103
We went out in front of the university, and we hitchhiked, and you couldn't, you had to get in line to hitchhike.

17:35.123 --> 17:38.147
Now, if you went downstream, you got penalized.

17:38.600 --> 17:43.204
They call that downstream or upstream either one.

17:43.845 --> 17:45.887
And we took time.

17:45.927 --> 17:47.088
I didn't have any time.

17:47.248 --> 17:51.833
I generally had to catch a ride to Houston as far as I could catch.

17:51.913 --> 17:54.475
And then I had to catch another ride then to Beaumont.

17:55.156 --> 17:58.820
Then from Beaumont home to Kirbyville, which was pretty hard.

17:59.660 --> 18:03.784
About how long did it normally take you to go from College Station to Kirbyville?

18:04.605 --> 18:06.447
Oh, about eight hours.

18:08.080 --> 18:12.867
Describe some of the experiences you remember hitchhiking as an Aggie.

18:14.609 --> 18:16.372
Well, I didn't have them any bad.

18:16.752 --> 18:17.754
All mine was good.

18:18.515 --> 18:31.573
I had one, I might not tell this, I got to Houston one time, was picked up, and a fellow picked me up out on Washington Avenue and was going to carry me across town.

18:32.482 --> 18:40.683
Well, we got about halfway through town and he put his hand over on my leg and started fooling him.

18:40.723 --> 18:43.670
And I told him, I said, stop this car right now and let me out.

18:43.951 --> 18:44.532
And he did.

18:44.552 --> 18:47.299
And that's the only bad experience I ever had.

18:47.620 --> 18:49.545
What about some of the good experiences?

18:50.032 --> 18:54.439
Oh well, every now and then you'd catch a ride, somebody would stop somewhere and buy you something.

18:56.222 --> 19:08.140
Mr. Smith, class of 1898, was a regular traveler on the highway and when he picked somebody up, he took good care of them.

19:08.160 --> 19:11.145
He always had peanuts in his car and he'd give you peanuts.

19:12.442 --> 19:18.332
Tell us, if you remember any more about Mr. Smith, please share that with us.

19:18.512 --> 19:20.977
I met him about 40 years ago.

19:21.618 --> 19:22.900
He was a great old man.

19:22.920 --> 19:30.012
And when we go to our luncheon or anything, where we all got up and

19:31.223 --> 19:58.260
called our name and class number he'd say class 98 that's 1898 and his son Doug Smith who is the class of 37 is a personal friend of mine now and I enjoy Doug Doug's in real bad health right now but I've always enjoyed the Smiths what mr. Smith senior lived in Houston yes what did he do for a profession oh

19:58.898 --> 20:02.057
Well, he owned real estate all over the United States.

20:03.264 --> 20:04.331
And he still does that.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.242
The state does, which Doug has

20:06.593 --> 20:30.019
run the estate and that's been a big job and I understand Doug's son of class of 67 is gonna have to take over and that's gonna be our awful job mr. Smith senior I ask you this with a straight face do you think he cared much about A&M very much yes sir he sure did he was a hundred percent for A&M describe

20:29.999 --> 20:34.914
when you were a freshman, describe a typical class day.

20:35.015 --> 20:36.299
What time did you get up?

20:36.660 --> 20:37.844
What did you do when?

20:40.051 --> 20:43.401
Well, we got up about an hour before breakfast.

20:44.225 --> 20:46.387
Now, that's too far back.

20:46.467 --> 20:48.470
I don't remember what the time of breakfast was.

20:48.590 --> 20:49.831
Anyway, we had to get up.

20:50.452 --> 20:57.720
We had to get up and clean our own room up and clean the upperclassmen room that we had to clean up.

20:57.780 --> 21:01.764
There was generally two freshmen to every upperclassmen room.

21:03.146 --> 21:06.950
And we had to clean and make their bed up and then go to breakfast.

21:07.510 --> 21:10.013
And by the time that was time to go to class.

21:09.993 --> 21:14.742
Now, back in those days, we had classes six days a week.

21:14.762 --> 21:16.285
We went to class on Saturday.

21:17.387 --> 21:22.576
And we was allowed, if you was taking a three-hour course, you could have three cuts, and that's all.

21:22.616 --> 21:25.842
If you didn't, you got knocked in your grades.

21:26.159 --> 21:31.225
And I never missed enough hours to get knocked.

21:32.567 --> 21:36.231
Now, for lunch, you didn't have to fall in.

21:36.631 --> 21:37.032
Did you?

21:37.092 --> 21:39.114
You went on your own to Cebisa?

21:40.936 --> 21:42.158
Didn't have to go as an outfit?

21:43.860 --> 21:44.821
I think we marched.

21:44.921 --> 21:45.602
I don't remember.

21:45.622 --> 21:47.824
I think we marched all three meals.

21:49.106 --> 21:49.887
I remember.

21:50.367 --> 21:55.153
Then in the afternoon, what time did the organized activities begin?

21:56.652 --> 22:02.344
Well, I was always interested in sports, and we had intramural sports.

22:03.185 --> 22:12.504
Most of the time, from the time classes was over until we had to march for dinner, supper you call it, or whatever you want to call it.

22:13.486 --> 22:16.332
We was out playing softball or something.

22:16.312 --> 22:19.736
What was your favorite intramural sport?

22:19.796 --> 22:22.498
Softball and basketball.

22:23.039 --> 22:28.044
Now, back in those days, A&M didn't have much of a basketball team.

22:28.565 --> 22:33.670
We only had, I think our freshman year, two boys that was on scholarship in basketball.

22:34.350 --> 22:43.720
And we all, Lil Demet was a basketball coach, and he had us all, the freshmen that wanted to try out basketball went down to

22:44.020 --> 22:55.971
to the gym, the wire wheel field house, and we got out on the field and we dribbled a ball and shot, and he stood up in the stand and he'd call you up there if he thought you was interested.

22:57.352 --> 23:06.405
The first day of that trial, I was out on the basketball court, and he sent somebody down to call me to come up, and I came up to talk to him.

23:06.425 --> 23:07.667
He says, what's your name?

23:08.809 --> 23:09.630
I said, Richardson.

23:11.493 --> 23:13.956
He says, you're not from Kirbyville, are you?

23:13.976 --> 23:15.158
I said, yes.

23:15.178 --> 23:16.640
He says, sign this boy up.

23:18.042 --> 23:24.912
Kirbyville had played Beaumont High several times in high school basketball, and we always give them a fit.

23:24.892 --> 23:30.562
And at one time, they was all Ritson and Beans.

23:30.582 --> 23:31.223
That was all.

23:31.323 --> 23:32.666
It was on the Kerbable team.

23:33.267 --> 23:34.429
And he remembered that.

23:34.469 --> 23:38.717
And so I went on, and I played freshman basketball.

23:39.478 --> 23:42.303
We didn't let her as a freshman back in those days enumerate.

23:42.423 --> 23:42.964
I enumerated.

23:43.024 --> 23:46.731
I was not on the first team, but I played enough that I won her enumerate.

23:47.453 --> 23:50.921
Who was the freshman coach, basketball coach?

23:50.961 --> 23:51.422
Lil Demers.

23:51.622 --> 23:52.364
Oh, he did both.

23:53.066 --> 23:55.832
He was the basketball coach, yeah.

23:55.852 --> 23:57.275
And the baseball coach.

23:57.475 --> 23:59.721
Where did you all travel to play games?

23:59.781 --> 24:01.064
What teams did you play?

24:02.226 --> 24:05.293
We played most of the Southwest Conference teams.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.859
And then did you play varsity ball the next year?

24:07.879 --> 24:08.079
No, sir.

24:08.139 --> 24:21.021
I went out for just a little practice my sophomore year, and then I decided that I had to give up basketball or give up codem engineer in one of the two, so I gave up basketball.

24:21.608 --> 24:26.594
While we're on sports, you were there when there were some very, very fine football players.

24:27.856 --> 24:32.002
Can you describe some of those men on the football team in those days?

24:32.742 --> 24:36.367
Well, my freshman year, Dick Todd was a senior.

24:36.387 --> 24:38.510
I enjoyed seeing Dick Todd play.

24:39.291 --> 24:43.737
I had followed Dick before I went to A&M, kept it while in the papers.

24:44.338 --> 24:47.802
And Dick was a fellow that I don't care how many men hit him or what,

24:47.984 --> 24:50.788
He always, when he went to the ground, he was on top.

24:50.828 --> 24:51.989
He was never on the bottom.

24:52.670 --> 25:03.284
And then, of course, I was there with the class that won the national championship, Marion Pugh and Odell Herman and that bunch, John Kimbrough.

25:03.845 --> 25:05.848
I really enjoyed the football.

25:07.049 --> 25:08.892
Did you know any of those personally?

25:11.075 --> 25:11.796
Well, I knew them.

25:12.597 --> 25:14.499
I wouldn't say I knew them real good.

25:14.639 --> 25:17.383
I knew them because I was at the gym all the time when they were.

25:18.005 --> 25:22.894
But Tommy Vaughn, I knew Tommy probably better than any of the rest of them.

25:22.934 --> 25:24.637
What were they like as individuals?

25:24.958 --> 25:25.979
Oh, they was good people.

25:26.801 --> 25:32.091
Now, on freshman basketball, I told you we didn't have any scholarships.

25:32.171 --> 25:36.739
Odell Herman and Marion Pugh played basketball.

25:36.719 --> 25:41.745
Odell was the roughest man I ever played against in my life on the basketball court.

25:41.765 --> 25:45.730
And one day I decided I was going to get even with Odell.

25:46.311 --> 25:54.621
And so we was running down the court, and just before we got to the goal, I dropped down on my all fours, and Odell fell over me.

25:54.641 --> 25:59.807
And he busted his head good, and I didn't have no trouble with Odell the rest of the season.

26:00.479 --> 26:05.012
Did those fine athletes go to class in those days?

26:05.092 --> 26:06.275
Yes, sir.

26:06.295 --> 26:06.696
Yes, sir.

26:06.977 --> 26:07.639
As far as I know.

26:08.401 --> 26:13.094
I didn't have any classes with them because they wasn't taking engineering courses.

26:13.455 --> 26:15.822
Coach Norton, what was he like as a person?

26:16.612 --> 26:18.475
I didn't know Coach Norton too well.

26:18.535 --> 26:21.519
I wouldn't comment on that because I didn't know him that well.

26:21.700 --> 26:22.761
Did you know Colonel Andy?

26:23.102 --> 26:23.482
Yes, sir.

26:23.763 --> 26:25.225
Colonel Andy was a nice fellow.

26:26.627 --> 26:31.955
Describe him any more, because we don't know that much about him.

26:33.437 --> 26:35.780
Well, I think everybody liked Colonel.

26:35.860 --> 26:37.823
Everybody that run track liked Colonel.

26:38.224 --> 26:41.328
I never heard of anybody criticize him.

26:42.350 --> 26:45.775
Let me share with you this anecdote I learned from his son.

26:46.885 --> 26:51.773
Colonel Andy played for DX Bible at a prep school in Tennessee.

26:53.175 --> 27:00.767
And then Coach Bible got hired at Mississippi College, a little Baptist school in Clinton, Mississippi, to be the football coach.

27:01.789 --> 27:10.122
And Colonel Andy then had graduated from high school, and so he went with Coach Bible down to Mississippi College.

27:11.784 --> 27:14.108
The year that Colonel Andy was a senior,

27:14.678 --> 27:16.840
They were playing what is now Mississippi State.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.382
It was then called Mississippi A&M.

27:19.624 --> 27:25.430
They'd only brought about 15 or 16 on the traveling squad and a bunch of them got hurt.

27:26.551 --> 27:29.755
They were ahead 13 to nothing at the halftime.

27:30.135 --> 27:32.658
First time they'd ever been ahead of Mississippi State.

27:33.399 --> 27:39.726
But then when a bunch of them got hurt, they didn't have 11 guys out on the field all the time.

27:40.567 --> 27:44.331
And while some of their people were hurt, they had only 9 and 10.

27:44.800 --> 27:48.927
Mississippi State got ahead of them and beat them 14 to 13.

27:50.930 --> 28:03.611
Then Coach Bible gets hired to be the coach at Texas A&M in the early 20s and he brings with him this young man Anderson who had played football for him as an assistant coach.

28:05.374 --> 28:10.082
Two years later they're up in Dallas and they're playing a postseason game

28:11.058 --> 28:15.686
Heine Weir, the good running back, had hurt his knee in the Texas game.

28:17.228 --> 28:30.811
And according to Colonel Andy's son, Coach Bible turns to Colonel Andy and said, remember what happened to us over there at Mississippi College when we didn't have enough guys to get out there and play?

28:30.851 --> 28:32.273
We didn't have 11.

28:32.877 --> 28:33.579
They beat us.

28:34.081 --> 28:46.296
So would you go up there in the bleachers and get King Gill to come down here and put on his uniform so if Heine Weir gets hurt, we'll have a substitute to go in for him?

28:47.221 --> 28:56.864
So according to Colonel Andy's son, that's where the 12th man story really comes from way back over in Mississippi.

28:58.528 --> 29:03.880
One of the interesting details I've uncovered in this.

29:03.860 --> 29:18.346
Back to your days in the Corps, what did you and your buddies do when you were freshmen if you had an hour or two to kill in the afternoon?

29:18.406 --> 29:19.769
What did you all do to relax?

29:21.091 --> 29:23.235
Well, yeah, they played kind of sport.

29:23.924 --> 29:26.506
Where where mostly did work?

29:26.927 --> 29:28.428
Where did y'all play those sports?

29:28.468 --> 29:29.529
What what fields?

29:29.789 --> 29:30.690
What locations?

29:30.710 --> 29:35.835
Well at that time I we were I was in Perrier Hall right outside Perrier Hall.

29:36.295 --> 29:38.898
There's a back in those days was a drill field.

29:39.779 --> 29:39.919
Mm-hmm.

29:39.939 --> 29:43.282
It's not a drill field now, but it was a drill field and that's where we played.

29:43.842 --> 29:49.047
Did anybody ever play on what we now call the Simpson drill field?

29:49.888 --> 29:52.210
The one in front of the MSC?

29:52.932 --> 29:55.095
Did intramurals ever take place there?

29:56.657 --> 29:58.299
Or was that just only for drilling?

29:59.300 --> 30:02.645
Well, well, that's what I'm about to feel we thought.

30:02.665 --> 30:03.166
Oh, okay.

30:03.266 --> 30:04.327
Okay.

30:04.587 --> 30:05.689
So it was all right.

30:05.729 --> 30:07.431
So it was all our sport.

30:07.491 --> 30:09.254
All the intramural sports were played there.

30:10.255 --> 30:14.080
Now, most of your engineering courses were held in what buildings?

30:14.903 --> 30:17.646
Well, the chemistry building, petroleum building.

30:17.666 --> 30:18.047
Okay.

30:18.287 --> 30:19.248
Academic building.

30:20.329 --> 30:23.152
That's about all I went through in the course of core.

30:23.973 --> 30:32.163
In your first two, first year or so, if you needed some advice on what courses to take, who did you go to?

30:34.685 --> 30:36.788
Who gave you assistance and encouragement?

30:37.489 --> 30:39.731
Didn't have any choice.

30:39.751 --> 30:40.993
You had to take certain courses.

30:41.113 --> 30:41.874
Oh, okay.

30:41.894 --> 30:42.574
All right.

30:42.594 --> 30:44.016
Which courses were the toughest?

30:45.734 --> 30:46.155
for you?

30:46.916 --> 30:47.477
Calculus.

30:47.777 --> 30:48.338
Calculus.

30:48.658 --> 30:49.520
Do you remember who taught it?

30:50.241 --> 30:51.362
No, I don't remember.

30:51.983 --> 30:54.327
What were the easiest, the most enjoyable?

30:59.254 --> 31:06.585
Well, the most entertaining idea, what I hadn't, and Kirbyville didn't have a chemistry department.

31:07.947 --> 31:12.273
My freshman year in chemistry, boy, I was lost for the first six weeks.

31:13.195 --> 31:14.897
And I had a

31:16.261 --> 31:24.715
graduate student was teaching my chemistry course, associate professor, and he said, Richardson, have you ever had any chemistry?

31:24.735 --> 31:25.536
And I said, no.

31:27.159 --> 31:30.264
He said, well, I want you to come to my office.

31:30.284 --> 31:42.403
I think I went three days a week after classes, and he tutored me, and I made a C, which I was proud of because I was failing

31:42.704 --> 31:46.020
until he started that, and I've always looked forward to that.

31:47.547 --> 31:49.677
Don't ask me his name because I don't remember his name.
