WEBVTT

00:02.427 --> 00:05.050
Well, the tape has just stopped. We'll turn it 
over. And I was asking about the changes that

00:06.711 --> 00:31.978
occurred from the close of the Depression as it 
came to a close, giving way to World War II and these

00:06.711 --> 00:31.978
increasing demands and the incentive for all-out 
production, prices strengthening.

00:37.814 --> 00:52.927
I wasn't conscious of when that happened.

00:53.468 --> 01:01.475
But there wasn't a particular point in time when 
they said, well, look, we've got the depression

00:53.468 --> 01:01.475
whipped. We've got a new problem here of 
increasing production. No, we didn't have it that

01:04.537 --> 01:06.719
way. We just eased into the... For some of us who, I 
was a student in college during those periods, and

01:09.691 --> 01:30.253
now I look back on it, and we sometimes get the 
perspective that up to a certain time they're

01:09.691 --> 01:30.253
addressing this problem, and suddenly they got 
that solved, they got a whole new problem. But

01:31.134 --> 01:38.702
you're saying that when you're out there on the 
farm and working with the farmers, the change

01:31.134 --> 01:38.702
wasn't all that great. You know, farmers don't 
adjust so quickly. Yes.

01:49.227 --> 01:59.157
They learn how to do things,

01:49.227 --> 01:59.157
and they go right on doing them, even in times when 
things change. Yes. And it takes a mile for them to

02:00.138 --> 02:08.186
catch up with the change. And I think that's true of 
all farmers. Well, it's true of most of us. I find

02:13.432 --> 02:20.784
myself having a hard time adjusting my teaching 
program to the computer. I'm glad I don't have your

02:22.487 --> 02:28.777
problem. But I see you've got your electronic hand 
calculator there that you operate. I don't have

02:37.255 --> 02:38.977
the controls there. Oh, that controls. I thought 
maybe you balanced your checkbook with that. Oh,

02:41.799 --> 02:42.460
no. I see. I don't have enough money to worry about. 
Well, actually, I don't either. I find that the

02:51.349 --> 02:55.973
less money I have, the more I have to worry about it 
and the more carefully I have to plan. Let me ask you

02:57.755 --> 03:05.322
a question or two, though, about the kind of 
adjustments that have taken place. You

03:07.327 --> 03:19.019
were involved with research when irrigation came 
into the high plains, weren't you? No. How did that

03:21.422 --> 03:23.464
all take place? Was it very rapidly? I

03:25.346 --> 03:35.697
wish I could get an answer to that first.

03:46.426 --> 03:48.368
Relatively so. It came quite rapidly along toward 
the close of the 1930s and 40s? Late 30s, 1940s.

04:07.568 --> 04:13.334
That had a tremendous impact on that part of the 
state, didn't it? Increased their worries.

04:14.995 --> 04:17.157
increased their worries, their costs. They lost a 
lot of the flexibility they used to have. Land

04:23.123 --> 04:27.348
prices rose substantially. One

04:27.468 --> 04:32.033
set of troubles to another. Their type of farming 
changed too, didn't it, some?

04:39.540 --> 04:41.222
Well, they're still growing cotton. That was dry 
land cotton before, and they chained over it. Were

04:48.077 --> 04:49.680
they growing corn before? No. So corn came in with 
that, didn't it? And then their sorghum

04:54.829 --> 05:00.218
production increased very rapidly, very 
substantially. And then that gave rise to the

05:02.261 --> 05:04.605
cattle feeding. See, it didn't take much water, 
sorghum and corn.

05:11.425 --> 05:18.172
The cattle feeding then soon followed after 
irrigation, didn't it? Yeah, I wasn't conscious

05:18.192 --> 05:28.724
of the cattle feeding

05:18.192 --> 05:28.724
until the 1940s. Then there was the biggest, 
probably the biggest area of transition was in

05:28.744 --> 05:36.913
East Texas, wasn't it? What was farming like in 
East Texas when you came down here? Well, it was all

05:41.581 --> 05:45.024
in little farms. 10,

05:45.044 --> 05:51.290
15 acres of cotton. I see. And these were not only on 
the riverbeds, but everywhere? What about on this

05:57.436 --> 06:04.302
land around College Station and between here and 
Huntsville? Would much of that land be farmed in

06:04.362 --> 06:10.508
small farms, or was that cultivated?

06:13.323 --> 06:18.689
When you talk about East Texas, I don't include 
that. You go further east, yes. Trinity. On the

06:22.934 --> 06:28.400
Trinity River, up in that way.

06:28.420 --> 06:36.129
Well, in what I call East Texas, farming went out 
completely. Yes. A little 10, 15 acres of cotton.

06:42.635 --> 06:52.724
about the same amount of corn, and a lot of little 
farmers, too.

06:52.744 --> 06:54.466
Well, the whole thing went out. Yes. Were these 
primarily these small operations, were they

06:56.107 --> 07:04.535
tenant farmers for the most part? Sharecroppers?

07:10.120 --> 07:11.781
Well, it wasn't up there to share. I see. I see.

07:20.615 --> 07:32.070
I

07:20.615 --> 07:32.070
see. Did, in that, you made a study of East Texas, 
didn't you? Along in the very early late 20s or

07:43.952 --> 07:48.558
early 30s? Early 30s. In the early 30s. That's the 
first area that we studied when I came to Texas. I

07:55.428 --> 07:55.848
see. What was your conclusion? Do you recall what 
your conclusions were about cotton farming then,

07:58.251 --> 08:09.527
its future?

08:10.807 --> 08:30.373
That

08:10.807 --> 08:30.373
was an important cotton producing area of the 
state then, was it? Yes.

08:38.925 --> 08:40.527
First one and then another one. give up farming. 
And that land would be,

08:42.890 --> 08:57.233
I always thought of Houston people buying the land

08:42.890 --> 08:57.233
and taking it out of farming. It's

08:57.513 --> 09:02.641
a fairly gradual process. It's either farms They 
were different ages, and those farmers had to go

09:07.979 --> 09:14.368
out of business or die off. Yeah. And put a piece of 
land

09:15.750 --> 09:22.780
on the operator, farming it. Nobody else wanted 
it. Nobody would take it on to grow cotton. To grow

09:29.128 --> 09:32.093
cotton, yeah. So the gins had a real rough time 
then. Oh, yeah. I don't suppose there's any gins in

09:36.211 --> 09:38.915
East Texas. Probably not. But during that time of 
transition, the cotton industry, as I recall,

09:40.697 --> 09:55.377
that is my recollection of the cotton industry, is 
that it was a very strong, outspoken industry.

09:55.397 --> 09:58.241
They were highly organized at the industry level. 
The gins, the ginners, the marketers, did they How

10:04.207 --> 10:10.694
did they react to your studies that says cotton 
can't survive in this area? I don't remember any

10:12.637 --> 10:16.020
trouble with those people. You didn't have any 
problems with them? No.

10:26.052 --> 10:31.278
I guess I was fortunate in that I had Bill Morgan. 
Yes. And he was in good with the extension service,

10:32.978 --> 10:50.004
and particularly with Williams.

10:50.024 --> 10:56.774
And I think Bill, for a while, was in and he said in 
the extension service.

10:56.794 --> 11:00.960
But

10:56.794 --> 11:00.960
as I Somehow I've had the impression that when your 
studies first predicted that along about the end

11:01.463 --> 11:28.737
of the 30s that cotton was going to be going out, 
that there

11:01.463 --> 11:28.737
were some people from the in the cotton industry 
that might have given you guys a pretty bad time and

11:29.476 --> 11:37.267
wanted your research stopped. If it was, I wasn't 
aware of it. I see. And this

11:40.391 --> 11:44.757
Bill Morgan. Yes. He stood in especially well with 
the director of the extension service. And when he

11:53.889 --> 11:56.032
said anything, that was it. Mm-hmm. He and I worked 
very closely. Yes.

12:02.701 --> 12:17.665
So if you really didn't experience, so far as you 
were concerned, as a researcher, you didn't have

12:02.701 --> 12:17.665
any spokesman, any opposition out there coming to 
the administration and say, look, we think you

12:02.701 --> 12:17.665
ought to get Bonnen off of this cotton research in 
East Texas. No. Uh-huh. See, but at the same time,

12:20.890 --> 12:24.737
Bill Morgan was in the Extension Service. Uh-huh. 
Well,

12:26.041 --> 12:33.452
that's interesting. Sometimes, you know, when 
what you're saying, when your research points out

12:33.492 --> 12:52.660
some changes that are coming about, those people 
who have something to lose from those changes get

12:33.492 --> 12:52.660
pretty vocal and try to bring pressure to bear. You 
didn't experience that kind of influence. Big

12:57.344 --> 13:00.247
losers were the Jenners and people like that. Yes, 
the cotton merchants. And

13:02.169 --> 13:08.275
they were sort of swept out of it. Yes. But they 
didn't influence, they didn't try to slow down

13:10.817 --> 13:19.266
that process by having your... I wasn't conscious 
of it, I'll say it. By having your stuff stopped.

13:29.558 --> 13:39.170
This area of adjustment has been a constant one for 
Texas, hasn't it? Oh, yeah. Probably more so than

13:40.491 --> 13:42.594
most other areas.

13:48.641 --> 13:48.761
Yeah. East Texas, south Texas. Yes.

13:54.168 --> 13:56.230
Then adjusting to water up in the panhandle. Yeah. 
And then adjusting... As water's getting used up,

13:58.634 --> 14:03.440
they've got to adjust back now. There's another 
big adjustment that's coming. I don't know

14:06.244 --> 14:09.888
whether they can make that adjustment or not. Yes.

14:13.393 --> 14:15.115
Did you know Frank Hughes? Did you work with Frank 
Hughes quite a bit? Frank was with USDA when I came

14:17.378 --> 14:23.646
here. I had always had the feeling that if I could 
just tap Frank's mind and the recesses of his

14:25.516 --> 14:46.707
understanding, I could probably learn more about 
the water supplies and how it was used in the

14:25.516 --> 14:46.707
Panhandle, Texas, than just about any other 
source of information.

14:50.993 --> 14:52.335
You could get a good deal. Yes. Unfortunately, I 
never did get it. I went to him just at the time when

14:59.057 --> 15:21.409
he was retiring and with a series of questions and 
said, is there any way that we could get you to write

14:59.057 --> 15:21.409
a manuscript covering your research up here. And 
somehow Frank had been offended either by

15:27.625 --> 15:39.277
university administration or by USDA.

15:41.159 --> 15:53.252
And he says, I've got only one thing in my mind, and 
that is to quit and never get involved again.

15:54.464 --> 15:56.247
They've got their last word out of me. So we didn't 
quite get him to get down all that he had learned.

16:03.458 --> 16:03.579
Right. Yeah.

16:11.231 --> 16:12.433
Well, Mr. Bonin. I think people in research

16:12.453 --> 16:21.788
tend to get it a little better than they do in the 
extension of life.

16:28.957 --> 16:52.752
I

16:28.957 --> 16:52.752
guess the extension serves to deal with more 
individuals. I've never been conscious of the

16:52.772 --> 16:54.795
much difference, the difference of opinion among 
the surgery people.

16:59.078 --> 17:06.108
Research people don't deal with as many 
individuals as the extension people do. Yes. And

17:08.872 --> 17:16.323
in research, you're not always needing to sell 
yourself as you sell your message. No. As they are

17:17.926 --> 17:19.067
in extension. And maybe that's one reason. Here it 
is. You can either take it or leave it. I feel that

17:27.319 --> 17:27.820
way. Yes. Yes, I think so. You've had a very 
fruitful career, Mr. Bonin. Very productive. You

17:41.109 --> 17:48.177
were part of a small research group that was 
probably unique in history. I have reviewed that

17:49.618 --> 17:57.587
period when there was you Of course, under Mr. 
Gabbard, Paulson, just the three of you there for a

17:58.276 --> 18:08.306
while, and they comprised most of that research 
group. Yet, your productivity in terms of

18:09.808 --> 18:17.696
publications is phenomenal.

18:17.816 --> 18:23.322
Not only were they the typical bulletins, but you 
had a large number of publications in referee

18:25.023 --> 18:29.930
journals.

18:33.115 --> 18:50.980
I believe on that the number of referee journals 
that were put out by your group

18:33.115 --> 18:50.980
was

18:33.115 --> 18:50.980
per say over a decade was almost as large as it was 
during the decade, say, of the 50s,

18:51.736 --> 19:08.173
when the staff was much, much larger, say, five or 
six times larger. Perhaps it was because you were

19:09.955 --> 19:17.203
focused so sharply on the research problems and 
not diverted Maybe, I don't know. Perhaps it was

19:20.173 --> 19:23.936
just the unique individuals that were there. Mr. 
Gabbard apparently was a good researcher.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.463
Paulson surely was. Very productive, wasn't he?

19:39.670 --> 19:45.856
Paulson was an individual that you had to know to 
appreciate.

19:45.976 --> 19:48.658
I don't know whether you've ever seen them enough 
in the old experiments, the main experiment

19:49.060 --> 19:54.626
station building. We had

19:54.646 --> 20:08.800
room size safes that you could lock and they had 
metal shelves all around the sides and he and I

19:54.646 --> 20:08.800
shared one of those. I see. And before things had 
gotten Not along too far. He had all these shelves

20:19.252 --> 20:32.493
covered

20:19.252 --> 20:32.493
with reports and so on. And I had one little shelf 
there.

20:37.722 --> 20:41.087
He just kept moving around with one shelf and 
another.

20:43.792 --> 20:44.633
It was safe. He pulled a lot of material.

20:50.144 --> 20:51.126
He ran in trouble.

20:54.371 --> 20:57.696
But he collected all kinds of stuff that he never 
used. Yes. He'd just keep putting it on the shelves

20:58.417 --> 21:01.221
and leaving it there. I wonder if that isn't true of 
marketing people generally. Maybe, I don't know.

21:08.912 --> 21:10.214
I've never made a study of that. I haven't either, 
but I've, of the most eclectic people in our

21:14.532 --> 21:21.441
profession that I've got to know who gather great 
volumes. Many of them are marketing, involved in

21:23.665 --> 21:28.131
marketing, and maybe that's... There's just a lot 
of relevant data and arguments that they think

21:29.092 --> 21:36.642
they're going to have to have reference to. Well, 
Mr. Bonin, I've taken... an hour and a half of your

21:42.443 --> 22:10.780
time here and it's been very rewarding

21:42.443 --> 22:10.780
you look back on on your profession do you have any 
any recollections or any feelings about how this

21:42.443 --> 22:10.780
profession has changed this is going to be the 75th 
we are going to be entering the 75th year since the

21:42.443 --> 22:10.780
since the Association began professionally.

22:17.656 --> 22:20.641
It's expanded a great deal, but how else? Do you see 
some ways, do you recall ways, or have some sense of

22:20.661 --> 22:27.191
ways in which it has changed?

22:35.044 --> 22:37.628
Not having thought much about those things.

22:42.552 --> 22:45.717
There's a heck of a lot more people working there.

22:48.681 --> 22:48.761
Yes. It has become far more diverse. There are lots 
of sub-disciplines now, whereas when you began,

22:51.866 --> 23:09.471
there was marketing and farm management, and then 
general policy,

22:51.866 --> 23:09.471
finance. Your son, Jim, has distinguished 
himself notably in the profession, primarily in

23:10.987 --> 23:26.189
the area of policy, and quite clearly, policy has 
been important from the beginning. But there are

23:28.332 --> 23:30.735
now many other sub-disciplines.

23:35.903 --> 23:38.867
It's become more quantitative, I guess. Yeah, I 
think so. You began.

23:44.875 --> 23:48.360
It's become far more quantitative since I began. I 
finished my Ph.D. in 1954, and I'm glad I don't have

23:50.183 --> 24:01.821
to pass the exams that these students today have to 
take. So it's changing. Certainly is.

24:13.036 --> 24:27.207
If you come across any items, pictures, or 
memorabilia that you think would be of interest to

24:13.036 --> 24:27.207
our profession, why, let us know about them. I 
think I have a picture of the department, taken of

24:27.227 --> 24:33.019
the department.
