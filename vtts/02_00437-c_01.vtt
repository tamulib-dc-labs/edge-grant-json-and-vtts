WEBVTT

00:05.549 --> 00:06.891
Let me test this. Testing.

00:11.097 --> 00:12.319
OK, we can continue.

00:17.967 --> 00:25.858
Consequently, you felt that the quality of the 
students and of the instructors is very high. Did

00:26.820 --> 00:30.645
you go to a certain class? for a week and then go to 
another class for a week? Or did you go daily? What

00:35.791 --> 00:37.994
was their routine?

00:40.817 --> 00:46.825
The best of my memory, and I still think they follow 
the same system, they had us broken up in groups.

00:47.606 --> 00:56.076
And we'd have what's called seminars, which 
study, for instance, for maybe the first month,

00:56.562 --> 01:04.452
Well, the whole outfit first, the entire class, 
and I think I remember about 300 people, maybe,

00:56.562 --> 01:04.452
that worked on it. It must have been at least 300. 
The first part of the, it was supposed to last a

01:07.537 --> 01:12.463
year, by the way. Yeah, and it lasted seven months. 
Right. And why? The Korean War broke out. Yeah. So

01:17.830 --> 01:18.952
it was a short course. And we didn't get, I was the 
one class that we didn't get to finish. So they had

01:24.490 --> 01:25.792
to break it off short. But needless to say, by that 
time, I was glad to get out of the Air Force. I had it

01:30.918 --> 01:34.182
under my belt and on my record anyhow, so I was glad 
to go. But they had you in seminars for a while, and

01:36.225 --> 01:39.309
then you go to a . Especially like economics,

01:39.329 --> 01:50.903
strategy,

01:39.329 --> 01:50.903
some history, military history. Then as we got 
towards the end of the course, each seminar became

01:51.355 --> 02:01.067
more specific and a lot of times about, let's say, 
shorter. Like we'd study fighter tactics for

02:01.248 --> 02:08.296
tactical air warfare. Just ground air support, 
that type of thing. And we'd have a monitor. And

02:14.685 --> 02:17.008
we'd break the classes down into panels then. 
Maybe 15, 20 officers. And the instructors, or if

02:21.460 --> 02:26.686
you will, the monitors, what do we call them? I 
guess monitors. Officer types, you know, a couple

02:29.789 --> 02:33.773
of us, colonel, lieutenant colonel, lieutenant. 
They'd monitor the panels and moderators. And

02:36.777 --> 02:41.602
we'd actually sit around the table and discuss and 
argue amongst ourselves. The main ones that I can

02:41.622 --> 02:49.290
remember and old Charlie Bond became famous for 
was when we got on international stuff and the

02:41.622 --> 02:49.290
Russians. Because, you see, I've been over in 
Russia a year. I had very definite opinions and

02:53.470 --> 03:00.598
didn't hold back in expressing what I felt very 
strong about. And I was complimentary towards the

03:01.639 --> 03:07.385
Russians in a lot of ways about the capabilities of 
what I saw. And I became known as Red or Pink

03:07.465 --> 03:10.288
Charlie. But I was respected. We graded each 
other. Students graded each other at times. And I

03:15.674 --> 03:19.918
was very proud of what my classmates thought of me. 
Why'd they call you Pink Charlie? Because you had a

03:23.051 --> 03:26.894
couple of good things to say about the Soviet 
Union? Yeah, and of course this was a period of

03:26.914 --> 03:31.499
McCarthyism and anti-communist fear. And I 
didn't also, at that time, I think I told you

03:33.120 --> 03:47.815
before, I was still fairly well convinced that the 
war had been inevitable between us. And I always

03:48.175 --> 03:50.057
opened my comments, and I still say it. You've 
heard me say it to you. I've been, I've dealt with

03:54.953 --> 04:08.449
practically every national portion of the world, 
been on practically every continent in the world,

03:54.953 --> 04:08.449
except Korea, and I've met people all over the 
world. Far East, Europe, India, your name is

04:09.550 --> 04:13.214
Africa, South America. I've never met a man on the 
street I'm talking man of the street type I'm

04:18.134 --> 04:22.461
talking about, civilian versus civilian. And 
fighter pilot versus fighter pilot,

04:22.601 --> 04:25.766
professionally speaking. I've never met a race of 
people more like the Americans than the Russians.

04:31.935 --> 04:34.399
Now, that's the people of the street I'm talking 
about. Now, war erupts in June of 1941 by August of

04:34.419 --> 04:40.588
1951. Did I say 41? I thought 51. By August of 1951, 
You're no longer a student. Were you eager to get to

04:48.520 --> 04:49.841
that war? Yes, but I didn't go to that war. I know you 
didn't, but were you eager? Oh, yeah. Did you want

04:56.188 --> 04:59.972
to become a combat fighter pilot? As a matter of 
fact, I was picked at one time and knew I was going to

04:59.993 --> 05:15.369
be assigned to command one of the two tactical 
ground control groups that was in the Iron Tire

04:59.993 --> 05:15.369
Force. There were two of them. This is a ground 
control environment, if you will, including

05:16.100 --> 05:26.754
radars and all the communication equipment for 
controlling tactical air warfare and giving

05:16.100 --> 05:26.754
close air support to the Army. We had two of them in 
the United States, in the United States Air Force.

05:31.380 --> 05:34.905
And one of them obviously had to go to Korea because 
we were in the war. And I was picked and tapped, and I

05:35.306 --> 05:40.593
was going to go command that unit. How did you feel 
about that? And I was tickled to death. Of course,

05:42.555 --> 05:44.638
I... I would prefer it to have been in one of the 
fighter outfits. And I admit I had a little qualms

05:48.363 --> 05:56.873
about, gee, what's this going to do to my future, 
and so forth and so on. But at least I knew I was going

05:57.054 --> 05:59.597
to be in the war. And then the next thing I knew, when 
the assignments came out, I was ordered to go to

06:00.358 --> 06:12.212
Northeast Air Command to do air defense planning 
for the northern area of uh well the northern area

06:13.390 --> 06:40.933
of the western hemisphere namely tuli the huge 
base of tuli and continue the implementation of

06:13.390 --> 06:40.933
the plans that i had originally laid on for 
continuing the air defense pine tree system of

06:13.390 --> 06:40.933
radars up the coast of uh of canada in other words i 
was picked to implement the plan that I had laid

06:41.639 --> 06:45.764
down as a planner the previous year. Is that why 
they sent you to Newfoundland? I was more

06:47.887 --> 06:53.354
qualified, much more qualified to do it because I 
had drawn up the plans for it. How could I argue

06:53.434 --> 06:54.736
that? True, but what were your feelings when you 
found out that you weren't going to Korea, you were

06:55.216 --> 07:02.145
going to Newfoundland?

07:04.252 --> 07:10.040
I'd make the feelings, but at the same time, I knew 
this time I was going to have a family with me. That

07:10.120 --> 07:11.862
helped offset the feelings. And I rapidly gave up 
any hard feelings about losing the opportunity to

07:11.882 --> 07:23.818
go to war because I wasn't completely sold on 
commanding this ground environment control

07:11.882 --> 07:23.818
outfit. I'd have been on the ground too much, and it 
didn't particularly grab me. So I was glad. And it

07:31.969 --> 07:33.972
gave me more confidence. It was a challenging job 
in the treated zones of the polar area of the world,

07:35.335 --> 07:46.192
and something I had not really been experienced 
in. Here was something else I was going to get some

07:46.212 --> 07:51.260
experience in. And you were there from August 1951 
to May of 1954, and you eventually became the

07:51.280 --> 08:01.315
commander of the 64th Air Division. See, that's 
what the plan was laid out. You were a full colonel

08:03.500 --> 08:06.624
at this time. Tell me about your command. What was 
under your command? First, I was the

08:09.888 --> 08:18.159
director of air defense from 1951 to 1952. There 
again, to finish the planning, detailed

08:18.279 --> 08:23.466
planning. if you will, take field trips and 
supervise the installation of radar sites and

08:23.767 --> 08:33.918
all, which is extremely interesting, flying up 
and down Labrador Coast in amphibious type

08:23.767 --> 08:33.918
airplanes. Then going up to the frigid north with 
Thule Air Base and planning the, now that was a new

08:33.939 --> 08:44.470
planning completely, down the planning for 
the... And you were working right with the

08:33.939 --> 08:44.470
Canadians. Well, in

08:44.490 --> 08:50.297
Greenland, I had to be working with Denmark. Being 
there again was international planning. And I,

08:53.992 --> 08:58.918
again, was doing international planning with 
another nation. And really what we had to do was get

08:58.938 --> 09:02.702
their approval, that's all I had to do. It was more 
of a political and diplomatic thing. But this was

09:05.305 --> 09:16.178
the engineering feats and installing equipment 
on the ice cap on the periphery of Tule Air Force

09:05.305 --> 09:16.178
Base for our defense program. That's exactly what 
it is, Tule. That flag right there. It's north of

09:22.630 --> 09:25.233
the Arctic Circle. Oh, yeah. And there's the North 
Pole. These are weather sites. Floating ice on

09:32.540 --> 09:33.742
this one. It's on the north. It's on the northern, 
western edge of Greenland. It's like it's pretty

09:43.913 --> 09:46.736
close. Really north of Greenland. Everything's 
north of there.

09:52.343 --> 09:54.025
the North Pole. I have been within 50 miles of the 
North Pole. Key three of weather stations on a

09:58.249 --> 10:01.493
floating ice. It may still be up there as far as I 
know. But I'm probably manned by civilians

10:04.897 --> 10:09.842
now. What were the problems there? Were they 
mostly technical? Mostly logistical. In frigid

10:16.690 --> 10:21.675
conditions, building

10:22.060 --> 10:43.309
For instance, a huge hangar that housed a B-52 on a 
tundra that was frozen correctly

10:22.060 --> 10:43.309
all the year, and then when it would melt, it would 
melt so far down on the ground, it would melt too far

10:22.060 --> 10:43.309
down and ruin the foundation of the building.

10:45.095 --> 10:50.383
The engineering feats that were accomplished up 
there were just something out of this world. What

10:50.423 --> 10:51.384
were some of them? But the cost. Well, for 
instance, the barracks and operations building

10:53.467 --> 11:12.756
and maintenance building all had to be built above 
the ground, let's say, primarily on six-by-six

10:53.467 --> 11:12.756
type logs to give about three feet clearance under 
the floor of the building and the ground so that the

11:13.057 --> 11:24.129
heat from the building and the floor would not melt 
the ground underneath it and then ruin the

11:13.057 --> 11:24.129
foundation of the building. And also let the 
flowing snow go past the building, underneath it,

11:24.209 --> 11:34.681
or above it, or beside of it, and not stack up and use 
this and practically cover it up. And actually

11:34.921 --> 11:36.082
cover it up. I've seen 20, 40-foot buildings 
completely covered up with snow along the

11:36.102 --> 11:41.308
Labrador coast. All the radars had to have radons 
on them to protect them from wind as high as 140

11:42.048 --> 11:48.938
knots. Well, they went in 140 knots, but we lost 
several over Labrador, California. And it took

11:53.584 --> 11:55.988
the radar with them. Did you lose any men? No. As a 
matter of fact, we, it was all, well, the Canadians

11:58.051 --> 12:05.121
helped us plan all this stuff. And of course, by the 
time we got to the plans for, you know, complete all

12:05.862 --> 12:09.507
those plans, plan for the radar sites up in 
northern Greenland. It's still frigid north, so

12:13.501 --> 12:23.675
it was applicable then, except on the ice cap, how 
to construct the basic buildings and things on the

12:13.501 --> 12:23.675
ice cap. And that's where we took some special 
engineering studies. The Corps of Engineers did

12:27.140 --> 12:29.343
all of this. But boy, there was some expert 
consultants, as a matter of fact, from other

12:29.363 --> 12:39.156
countries, brought in from the Norway and Sweden 
and Iceland, construction companies that were

12:39.338 --> 12:49.570
familiar with the North, would come over. What 
we'd do, for instance, put the radar on the ice cap

12:50.211 --> 12:56.879
north of what we call number one radar site. We had 
two radars on the ice cap about 15, 20 miles north

12:56.919 --> 13:05.970
and east of the base proper. dug out a big trench, 
huge trench, into the ice cap proper, then sunk

13:06.895 --> 13:35.552
about an 18-foot diameter conduit type, typical 
culvert you've seen, sunk that in the ice cap, and

13:06.895 --> 13:35.552
then covered it over, and then built with inside 
that iron pipe, if you will, everything we want to

13:06.895 --> 13:35.552
build, and then just stuck a hole up to it with a 
radar antenna sticking above the ice cap with a

13:06.895 --> 13:35.552
radar moment. That's the way that was. every inch 
of the water for the main site. Would you lose any of

13:42.424 --> 13:44.927
those? No. It would melt? No. It would melt. The way 
they built that idea, it couldn't melt, but it was

13:48.651 --> 13:52.315
looted. The main radar site, what's called a 
direction center south of the base, was really on a

13:53.136 --> 14:07.092
base proper, and it was just off the edge of the ice 
cap, but up on what we call a P-mount, a high peak. We

14:07.780 --> 14:24.138
had to build a road up to it, and we had to haul water 
up to it, and we'd haul water up to it during the

14:07.780 --> 14:24.138
summertime where we'd fill up a huge storage tank 
inside of a building which you had to keep heated to

14:07.780 --> 14:24.138
keep from freezing in the wintertime. And of 
course we had to haul fuel up there. It was

14:30.445 --> 14:33.588
completely a different logistical concept. 
Very, very interesting. Now you were the

14:35.978 --> 14:40.323
commander up there in the 64th Air Division, and 
how large was that? How many people did you have

14:40.383 --> 14:42.166
under your command?

14:46.371 --> 14:58.445
Well, we had a fighter squadron at Goose Air Base, a 
fighter squadron at Harmon Air Force Base, and we

14:46.371 --> 14:58.445
had a little detachment of three aircraft up at 
Thule.

15:01.849 --> 15:04.753
That was the fighters, and radar sites we had about 
One, two, three, four, five, six, about ten radar

15:05.020 --> 15:15.234
sites up the Canadian coast and on Newfoundland 
proper and then on Greenland around Thule. I

15:16.576 --> 15:26.229
forget, I must have had at least

15:16.576 --> 15:26.229
I must have had two or three thousand people. Three 
or four thousand. Three or four thousand.

15:29.113 --> 15:30.154
Scattered very thin. But now, of course, that 
doesn't include the huge bases that gave me

15:34.535 --> 15:37.078
support. Directly under my command. This is your 
first command? First large command, yes. First

15:45.167 --> 15:47.130
command at division level. I've had squadrons. Oh 
yeah, but I mean first command at division level.

15:53.757 --> 15:55.359
This is quite a boost for your career. Oh yeah, and I 
liked, as a matter of fact, I remember, well, I

15:56.500 --> 16:04.069
eventually, before I took that, from the Air 
Defense section I had under deputy for operations

16:04.488 --> 16:07.952
in the act. I eventually became the deputy for 
operations under General Myers when they changed

16:07.972 --> 16:12.917
commanders. Then from the deputy for operations, 
I went over and took the 64th Air Division. I

16:18.122 --> 16:22.787
changed from a staff job in operations to a full 
command job. So there again, I did the planning. I

16:24.729 --> 16:26.031
was very fortunate. I did the planning. I 
implemented the plans. Then I took over command of

16:29.194 --> 16:33.178
the units for me. moved them into the installation 
that commanded them. So it was a complete cycle,

16:37.102 --> 16:39.865
which I enjoyed very much. Besides the technical 
aspects, did you have any other challenges?

16:51.436 --> 16:55.059
I can't remember any unusual ones, except maybe at 
Thule. We had some more outcome at the time. At

16:56.841 --> 17:02.406
Thule, you have 180 days of so-called 182 days, if 
you will, of sunlight, 182 days of night.

17:07.193 --> 17:20.111
Generally speaking, for complete darkness, 
total darkness 24 hours a day, I think I remember

17:07.193 --> 17:20.111
it's about 81 days during the wintertime when the 
sun never gets above the horizon. And of course you

17:20.711 --> 17:27.060
can say the opposite thing during the middle of the 
summer when the sun just rotates right around the

17:20.711 --> 17:27.060
top of you, just stays above your head. In the 
wintertime, and I remember I used to feel this when

17:27.648 --> 17:33.874
I'd go up on a staff visit to the field. You know, my 
unit's up in Tulane State for about three or four

17:33.894 --> 17:37.477
days. You know, get up, it's dark. Go to bed, it's 
dark. Get up, it's dark. Go to bed, it's dark. Dark

17:42.522 --> 17:43.363
all the time. And psychologically, I could feel 
the effect. Now, imagine a guy being assigned a

17:46.626 --> 17:49.589
term for six months. The usual assignment was six 
months? Yeah, we had to shorten it to six months

17:51.631 --> 17:54.634
because it was for our reasons. in the wintertime 
particularly, and we'd give them leave, bring

17:54.918 --> 17:58.722
them back down, you know. We had hospital cases in 
the hospital at St. John Newfoundland

18:00.043 --> 18:14.598
headquarters right there at NEAC, where they were 
hospital cases of psychological shock and so

18:00.043 --> 18:14.598
forth from the total darkness season up until 
then. No kidding. But these were usually the

18:14.978 --> 18:18.001
younger, less experienced people. And how did you 
combat that? How did you combat these morale wars?

18:24.128 --> 18:30.157
Bringing them out of the area and then getting 
them, you know, mental therapy there at the

18:24.128 --> 18:30.157
hospital. Generally, we would never send those 
types back. And would you give, well, what about

18:33.562 --> 18:39.652
your regular people that were up there for six 
months and the officers were up there too for six

18:33.562 --> 18:39.652
months only? The what? Officers and men? Oh, sure. 
Okay. The commanders went to the base? And the...

18:48.597 --> 18:54.044
Well, the fighter crews eventually had up there 
for three aircraft, alert crews, you know,

18:48.597 --> 18:54.044
standing alert. We'd bring them back during that 
81 days. We had tried to arrange, you know, we had

18:58.230 --> 19:02.876
the Air Transport Command was particular. Well, 
you know, we had to. The only way to get supplies up

19:03.677 --> 19:05.760
there was by air. It was landlocked, you know, ice. 
You couldn't get ships up there. We planned the

19:10.406 --> 19:16.815
massive shipments in the summertime, all laid on 
by the military...

19:18.348 --> 19:21.733
Well, the ocean, the Navy. And if you didn't get 
that up there during that shipping season, then

19:21.753 --> 19:29.786
you knew you were going to have to carry it up by air 
later on. And you know, you can't carry some of the

19:29.886 --> 19:33.993
heavy cargo. You just can't afford to carry it all 
in the air. So we had a lot of air transportation in

19:37.118 --> 19:42.065
the wintertime during that darkness period. And 
we would bring the people back down south. the

19:45.787 --> 19:47.349
Pepperell Air Force Base. Some of them we even sent 
down maybe to back to the States for a week or two,

19:47.369 --> 19:56.844
vacation and leave,

19:47.369 --> 19:56.844
you know. It didn't take up much time. A lot of the 
people, the majority I'd say, didn't bother. It's

20:01.492 --> 20:03.395
only a few of the cases. All of us talked about it and 
knew it, but there were more mature people, I

20:03.755 --> 20:09.364
think, Did you have movies for them, 
entertainment? Oh, yeah. Gymnasium. Beautiful

20:17.753 --> 20:19.455
gymnasium you ever saw. Even way up there. Four 
basketball courts on the floor. Oh, yeah. Movies.

20:26.905 --> 20:28.027
Indoor tennis. Indoor swimming pools. How did you 
ever maintain a swimming pool up there? Well, it's

20:33.914 --> 20:38.721
built above the ground and inside where you... 
It's heated. It's heated. You know, you keep your

20:40.546 --> 20:43.751
potatoes in and heat them. You don't let them get 
outside and frozen for the mess. Everything, you

20:47.576 --> 20:50.401
keep things heated. How cold was it during the 
winter? The coldest I ever was was BW-8, an air base

20:54.126 --> 21:05.463
that was on the western side of Greenland versus 
BW-1, the extreme southern tip of Greenland. That

21:05.483 --> 21:07.687
was a route up to the base. But I remember the 
coldest Today I think I remember it was BWA and I

21:11.073 --> 21:18.966
think it was 48 degrees below zero. We had to put the 
airplane in the hangar immediately upon landing

21:20.348 --> 21:36.996
and close the hangar doors because of freezing up 
the hydraulic system and keep the airplane

21:20.348 --> 21:36.996
warm.

21:39.305 --> 21:45.013
There's a lot of funny stories that go on that I 
could tell you about, but they're unprintable

21:39.305 --> 21:45.013
about. For instance, the boys that go to the 
outdoor latrines.

21:51.822 --> 21:56.729
When it gets below 40 degrees, operations cease. 
Operations cease. I mean below 40 degrees below

21:58.852 --> 22:03.458
zero.

22:04.399 --> 22:08.805
We had a hardy soul, as a side story, called 
Glowtarts Charlie. He was building a weather

22:09.882 --> 22:21.494
station over here on the eastern coast of 
Northeastern extreme tip of Greenland.

22:24.277 --> 22:35.569
We dropped a tractor to him, an air portable 
tractor out of the back end of a C119.

22:37.608 --> 23:00.797
I think in the open season, shipping season, he 
came up off the eastern coast of Greenland and he

22:37.608 --> 23:00.797
had a, he started out from a weather shack which was 
a Danish weather station in the southern area, but

22:37.608 --> 23:00.797
he, we wanted this weather station further up 
north and he was going to start out from there. The

23:01.520 --> 23:06.046
reason we call him Bloat Tarts Charlie is that the 
only way he could get his tractor started was

23:01.520 --> 23:06.046
diesel. He had to use Bloat Tarts to get the 
manifold system and he just had fuel lines and all

23:06.066 --> 23:12.716
to get the tractor started. And he wouldn't go any 
place without a Bloat Tart.

23:18.123 --> 23:20.527
Did you like having your first divisional 
command? Yeah, I liked it very much. Did you enjoy

23:22.870 --> 23:26.916
the command part of it, the administration? I 
loved it.

23:31.726 --> 23:38.918
They had good people under me and it was basically a 
National Guard outfit that they had deployed up

23:31.726 --> 23:38.918
from the state of New York. No kidding. And in fact, 
I took it over as one of the few National Guard units

23:39.680 --> 23:52.001
that was taken over by the Air Force and inducted 
and sent overseas, if you will, as a unit. Usually

23:52.021 --> 23:56.569
they broke them up and filled regular units with 
them. At first, I had a few morale problems. They

23:59.111 --> 24:02.616
objected to an outsider coming in and taking over 
their unit. They forgot that they were in the Air

24:02.636 --> 24:05.199
Force. They still thought it was a nice guard unit 
from the ER. But it didn't take long to overcome

24:07.883 --> 24:11.427
that. How did you overcome it? Talking to them. I 
never did really have any problems with the

24:16.234 --> 24:18.997
command. I enjoyed it. I like to handle people. 
Okay. Let's go to your next question. your next

24:26.603 --> 24:32.875
assignment from June 54th to October 56th. Okay. 
To Colorado. Yeah, Colorado. Okay, Colorado.

24:38.705 --> 24:42.693
Well, here again is Conrad. Con-ed. Yeah. Air 
Defense Command. Yeah. Well, here again, and here

24:48.018 --> 24:54.866
you can see what was a logical pattern that 
sometimes you don't see in the armed forces. Here

24:54.926 --> 24:59.392
was a logical pattern of a man calling it career, 
air defense. It was logical that I would leave that

24:59.412 --> 25:16.472
part of the North American continent where I had 
implemented plans and supervised the

24:59.412 --> 25:16.472
construction of air defense units, both fighters 
and ground control equipment. then go back to the

25:17.515 --> 25:27.274
very headquarters of what was to be the 
headquarters of the entire North American air

25:17.515 --> 25:27.274
defense system, which that was a part of. The 64th 
Air Division was a part of it. And continue in the

25:29.739 --> 25:35.710
planning and operations for coordination of the 
entire nationwide, continent-wide air defense

25:36.078 --> 25:41.405
system. So I went back, I went to Colorado and was 
assigned to headquarters in their defense

25:41.425 --> 25:49.435
system. Now, Continental Air Defense System 
consisted of, it was a joint command. It consisted

25:55.203 --> 26:04.515
of the United States Army, the United States Air 
Force Air Defense Command, and We even got the Navy

26:04.968 --> 26:30.981
included with about 13 people and a Navy admiral 
trying to incorporate the United States Navy into

26:04.968 --> 26:30.981
this system from the standpoint of air defense and 
to be more specific on the secret extensions of

26:04.968 --> 26:30.981
early warning ships at sea, maybe 150 to 200 miles 
out to sea. And even the Navy early warning

26:31.001 --> 26:33.945
aircraft airborne radars off the sea approaches 
to the, both through the Atlantic and Pacific

26:34.347 --> 26:41.734
approaches to the United States. In other words, 
practically 270 degrees of protection for the

26:41.774 --> 26:56.047
northeast and west, and leaving really the only 
way bombers could come in the United States was to

26:41.774 --> 26:56.047
come across Mexico. And still, you know, this took 
a lot of planning, joint-wise. And ultimately, of

27:00.471 --> 27:02.413
course, to bring in the RCJF and their joint 
command of the Royal Canadian Army, or 90 units,

27:03.372 --> 27:33.160
anti-aircraft missile, as a combined command, 
namely NORAD, North American Air Defense System,

27:03.372 --> 27:33.160
and some people called it North American Air 
Defense Command, but NORAD, North American

27:03.372 --> 27:33.160
Air Defense. If I remember correctly, my first job 
there was,

27:34.051 --> 27:41.083
I think it was in plans again. Operation. 
Operation plans. DCSC ops, yes. Oh, that's right,

27:48.335 --> 27:49.257
yes. That's right, yes. I was made assistant DCSO 
under General Berkowitz. Mm-hmm. And exactly

27:57.440 --> 27:59.682
what was your function there? What was your duty 
there? I was the assistant. What does DCS stand

28:02.265 --> 28:03.847
for? Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations. Oh, 
okay, so you were the deputy chief for operations,

28:06.550 --> 28:09.312
okay. You'll notice throughout my career I was 
either operations, which really is a key staff man

28:09.332 --> 28:22.266
for conducting, directing the operations of a 
unit, or I was a commander. I can't recall ever

28:22.718 --> 28:31.672
having a primary job as personnel or material in 
any of my military service. I was very smart.

28:35.297 --> 28:38.422
But that's why I did the assistance for 
operations. In other words, whenever General

28:38.783 --> 28:42.829
Berkley was gone, I was DCSO of the command. We had 
two hats, Air Defense Command and Continental Air

28:42.929 --> 28:49.840
Defense Command, the Joint Command. For 
instance, our boss, the commander, 1st General

28:50.478 --> 28:59.248
Kidlaw, he was the commander of the Air Defense 
Command and reported to the Chief of Staff of the

28:50.478 --> 28:59.248
Air Force. With his joint head on, he was the Joint 
Commander of the Continental Air Defense Command

29:00.189 --> 29:09.200
and reported to the Joint Chief of Staff. 
Eventually, when NORAD came in, he was the

29:09.220 --> 29:18.831
Combined Commander and was Commander of the North 
American Air Defense System and reported not only

29:09.220 --> 29:18.831
to the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, 
but also, to a certain extent, to what was

29:19.553 --> 29:32.589
tantamount to the Joint Chiefs of Staff of Canada. 
One didn't know right from the other.

29:39.217 --> 29:49.189
See, General Chisdall left, must have been around 
58, let me see my, must have been around 58 or 50.

29:50.030 --> 29:51.612
Chitlow was the first commander.

29:57.039 --> 29:59.522
Had to be in the late, late 50s. No, it was early. 
Yeah, late 50s. I'm not sure about here, but the

30:03.508 --> 30:05.170
late 50s. I'm not sure about here. Now, what were 
your challenges here? What were my challenges?

30:12.019 --> 30:13.821
Yeah.

30:15.223 --> 30:16.424
Just getting the job done. It was a massive white 
spread. Oh, and incidentally, the plan would

30:18.802 --> 30:24.527
ultimately break in Alaska. See, the Alaskan Air 
Command as a part of the complete North American .

30:31.013 --> 30:36.779
And they had to be integrated in as an extension. 
That was planning. And we eventually called them

30:39.041 --> 30:47.509
a, if you will, a direction center for Northwest or 
Alaskan with the Alaskan Air Defense. And what

30:47.725 --> 30:52.711
kind of air defense did you put in Canada? Similar 
to the air defense in the United States. I mean in

30:55.093 --> 30:56.395
Alaska. Similar to that in the United States, the 
radars and fighters.

31:02.442 --> 31:06.366
Why did you wait until after Canada, after you did 
this with Canada? We didn't wait, I just forgot to

31:06.406 --> 31:08.368
tell you about it. Oh, okay. We visualized it 
initially. Okay, so this is being done back in the

31:11.333 --> 31:15.818
1940s. Well, planning in the 40s and actually 
implementing in the 50s. When I took over the 25th

31:21.846 --> 31:37.945
Air Division in Tacoma, McCord Air Force Base, 
northwestern part of the United States, I had

31:21.846 --> 31:37.945
liaison lines to the Vancouver area across the 
border. Actually, I commanded operationally.

31:40.814 --> 31:50.710
the Royal Canadian Air Force jet fighters at 
Vancouver and four radar sites in southwestern

31:40.814 --> 31:50.710
Canada. And I had direct communications with the 
air defense headquarters in Alaska because, see,

31:50.730 --> 31:59.324
I was more adjacent to them. I had to have early 
warning pass with me. I remember scrambling

32:02.469 --> 32:06.315
aircraft from, I'm talking too much, I remember 
scramming aircraft from my base in Payne Air Force

32:06.818 --> 32:24.498
Base just north of Seattle and intercepting a SAC 
bomber 250

32:06.818 --> 32:24.498
miles north of the Canadian border. Why? Catching 
them that far out. Why? Was this a maneuver? Oh, no.

32:30.505 --> 32:31.366
It was an exercise. Oh, it was an exercise. And boy, 
I loved that. As a matter of fact, I was proud of it. I

32:40.524 --> 32:48.534
had the long, the old F-89 type, what was called a 
wagon wheel type, long-range interceptors.

32:48.554 --> 32:55.122
Incidentally, the first one had the atomic air 
defense weapon on it, air defense missile. It was

32:55.142 --> 32:57.846
called GD, G-D-N-I. What year was that? That was 
in...

33:02.995 --> 33:07.820
That was when I was still at Dorian Headquarters in 
56, 55.

33:10.362 --> 33:28.320
We had, we took the air defense genie missile and 
had it mounted on, we had nuclear air-to-air

33:10.362 --> 33:28.320
missile active air defense in the United States in 
56, 57. Nuclear air-to-air? Still have it. I

33:31.784 --> 33:35.510
didn't realize that. That must be an awful small 
warhead. It

33:37.533 --> 33:41.059
is. Well, that'd do some destruction. Shooting a 
nuclear missile at another airplane. Why would

33:49.213 --> 33:50.695
you even need it? Why would it be necessary? 
Positive. Well, close misses sometimes with a

33:52.799 --> 33:56.745
regular missile may not get them. And this was big 
enough to get two or three. Also, you know, the

34:01.135 --> 34:09.106
blinding flash that blinded the remaining crew 
that were in formation.

34:09.126 --> 34:11.769
We're convinced the rest of it doesn't sink. What 
about the range on this? Oh, it got way out in front

34:13.592 --> 34:15.735
of us. That was one of the designs. Well, you break 
off two. We had to have a design special maneuver.

34:24.106 --> 34:26.850
And actually, we tried out at... out in the Luke Air 
Force Base out in the desert with, of course, a

34:27.303 --> 34:47.644
regular missile with no warhead in it to actually 
practice the maneuver and determine how best to do

34:27.303 --> 34:47.644
it to be sure that the pilot could get away from the 
missile in time not to be blown up with it. And, of

34:48.064 --> 34:52.669
course, the base maneuver turned immediately and 
banked away and down. pick up the fade and get away,

34:52.936 --> 35:09.354
and with it back to it, we still had visual blinders 
that we'd pull down the cockpit, and also on a

34:52.936 --> 35:09.354
pilot's visor that he would take the caution to 
keep from being blinded by the flash. Of course, he

35:09.374 --> 35:14.419
took the flash, what little was, right at the 
bottom of the airplane, so it turned out a bit. It

35:15.501 --> 35:16.221
was feasible. About what size of... bomb would be 
in one of these missiles, about how many megatons?

35:23.692 --> 35:26.335
Oh, it's very small, a few kilotons. Yeah, I don't 
mean megatons. Kilotons.

35:32.301 --> 35:36.886
But that's the size of the bomb that we dropped on 
the machine? No, smaller than that. This is what

35:39.009 --> 35:47.378
you call a tactical type nuke, a tactical nuke,

35:39.009 --> 35:47.378
if you will.

35:51.847 --> 36:04.127
Have we ever, to your knowledge, have we ever fired 
one of these missiles and exploded the warhead on a

35:51.847 --> 36:04.127
drone or anything? Oh, yeah, in lab tests over the 
moving ground out in Indian Springs where they

36:04.147 --> 36:12.481
test all the missiles. We fired one from an 
airplane. and shot down another drone, or shot

36:14.813 --> 36:17.657
down a drone, or another? I didn't do a drone. I 
mean, you know. I don't remember. Oh, well, it was,

36:21.062 --> 36:24.347
there was no doubt about that we could do that. It 
was just a matter of firing it, it'd explode, and

36:24.408 --> 36:29.856
the pilot could break away from it. This had been 
done. Tested, actually. Did it destroy the

36:33.321 --> 36:35.344
target? There was no target for it to destroy. It 
was just fired up in space. Oh. We didn't worry

36:39.310 --> 36:42.475
about, you know, getting close enough to destroy 
the target. And what was the impact on the pilot?

36:45.341 --> 36:46.322
None. And as a matter of fact, during that test,

36:46.342 --> 37:10.977
three of our staff officers who made your good tank 
contacts, who were very instrumental in

36:46.342 --> 37:10.977
following this program and pushing it from its 
very initial state to its final completion over a

36:46.342 --> 37:10.977
period of two or three years, they were so 
dedicated to it that they volunteered to stand on

36:46.342 --> 37:10.977
the ground below where that thing was going to be 
busted that I think it's, I forget how high it was,

37:12.053 --> 37:19.125
15, 20,000 feet. And they did, they were on the 
ground below. And of course they had to cause it

37:23.111 --> 37:27.499
with eyeglasses and all that. The main thing is 
blindness. It definitely felt the explosion. Do

37:33.849 --> 37:35.171
you remember what year this was? All I know it was 
around the mid-50s. It was while I was still at .

37:42.374 --> 37:59.190
Now, they were doing a lot of atomic experiments in 
the mid-1950s and the early 1950s, above ground

37:42.374 --> 37:59.190
experiments that we continue to tell of the 
mid-1960s when we signed a non-proliferation

37:42.374 --> 37:59.190
treaty. And recently, of course, there have been 
some

37:59.210 --> 38:09.820
army men, not officers necessarily, but men who 
have charged the United States government with

38:10.441 --> 38:18.553
using them as guinea pigs and standing them up in 
front of atomic blasts. I even saw this on 60

38:19.114 --> 38:21.157
Minutes. 60 Minutes, remember that program on 60 
Minutes? In which a number of troops were... Yeah,

38:26.345 --> 38:36.861
I didn't see it on 60 Minutes, but I know what you're 
talking about. They actually had some... Well,

38:37.880 --> 38:42.666
they said that maybe they got some radiation and 
then they had a higher rate of cancer. What was your

38:42.727 --> 38:45.751
opinion on that one? Dismissive of your mind. I 
actually met a friend when I went to work for TI,

38:49.275 --> 38:55.564
Texas

38:49.275 --> 38:55.564
Institute. I met one of my bosses, Nick Davis, an 
engineer. He's now a vice president of TI. He, at

39:03.435 --> 39:06.519
that time, was a Marine Corps buck private. Well, 
he was a private. And he was one time in a test in the

39:07.850 --> 39:26.296
trenches with his buddies, the Marine Corps boys 
in the ground, in one of those tests for the purpose

39:07.850 --> 39:26.296
of, you know, seeing what effects it would have on 
them. Of course, they were far away, safe enough.

39:28.799 --> 39:31.563
He remembers it and didn't bother him. And he 
certainly hadn't been suing the governor for any

39:31.583 --> 39:35.429
radiation. Okay. Now let's go back to your 
assignment here. Your assignment changed from

39:40.646 --> 39:45.816
CONAD to ADC. Is that the Air Defense Command? What 
year was it? This is 1956, October of 1956.

40:06.575 --> 40:08.477
Oh, yes, I can explain that. Now, that's when this 
is... October 56 to September 57. Now, that's in

40:12.863 --> 40:24.718
1956 is the day that CONAD was organized as a 
separate definite joint command, eventually

40:12.863 --> 40:24.718
with the idea of making it NORAD. So we had to 
separate ADCL. And we brought in an actual

40:27.702 --> 40:35.932
specifically assigned staff with just joint hats 
on, part of Army, part of Air Force. Mm-hmm. And I

40:36.173 --> 40:39.676
wasn't part of NORAD. I was just strictly the Air 
Force component. So they just changed, really, on

40:41.879 --> 40:51.648
paper, my position as part of the Air Defense 
Command, which was really the Air Force component

40:41.879 --> 40:51.648
of CONAD. Oh, OK. It's more or less a paper. OK, so 
you were basically doing the same assignment,

40:53.510 --> 40:58.154
though, because you were the deputy chief of 
staff. I didn't change my desk. Oh, OK. It's paper.

41:02.398 --> 41:04.020
OK, so you stayed the same. Basic job from June 1954 
to September 1957. That's right, exactly. In

41:12.089 --> 41:14.172
effect, I had two jobs, you might say. Did you like 
that job? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It was very

41:17.716 --> 41:18.898
interesting. And again, I was in the mainstream of 
everything. And incidentally, it was during that

41:22.463 --> 41:27.990
time that, no, no, forget what I said. Well, I was 
wondering about, you know, during the mid-1950s,

41:28.551 --> 41:32.016
throughout the internment, 1950s, the Strategic 
Air Command was popularized and almost

41:32.738 --> 41:40.530
glamorized. There were a number of movies about 
this. You are more correct in your latter

41:42.413 --> 41:44.356
statement. Glamorized, okay. And I was wondering 
what you people who weren't associated with the

41:46.680 --> 41:54.091
Strategic Air Command felt about that command. 
That's a good question.

41:59.418 --> 42:05.063
I don't know if you've been given this question by 
the Defense Department, but it does make a

41:59.418 --> 42:05.063
difference, and it's a good question. This was 
also a very key part of our planning, the

42:06.464 --> 42:14.011
communications from what was to be the hole in the 
mountain. And until that was put in the mountain,

42:15.433 --> 42:26.623
in our control center right at the Air Defense 
Command Base headquarters at the Air Force Base

42:15.433 --> 42:26.623
right in the middle of Colorado Springs City 
itself, as we're at a control center,

42:27.160 --> 42:31.607
communication direct from us to the SAC command 
center. Because they were the first. In the

42:33.109 --> 42:34.151
mountain. No, they were up at Omaha. Yeah, okay. 
Their headquarters there. Okay, but they were

42:38.357 --> 42:40.480
building NORAD in the mountain. Oh yeah, yeah. In 
Colorado Springs, right up in the mountain, up in

42:41.061 --> 42:44.887
Getsam Mountain. But essentially Colorado 
Springs. Okay. That was the ultimate control

42:47.972 --> 42:49.995
center. We didn't want to stay exposed above the 
ground. SAC got very below the ground also now,

42:55.304 --> 43:00.650
deep in the ground of Omaha. But we had to 
definitely see. They were the first ones we wanted

43:02.592 --> 43:04.354
to warn. We were more interested in warning them 
before we were the population, quite frankly. I

43:08.058 --> 43:13.204
can say that because we wanted them to get off the 
ground before the bombers hit. Oh yeah, as a matter

43:13.544 --> 43:19.290
of fact, and we had very close coordination with 
them. I personally have been in many planning

43:19.692 --> 43:43.442
conferences with Slack people, and particularly 
the communications and the procedures and

43:19.692 --> 43:43.442
techniques, the way we would pass information to 
one another and warn, you know, and acknowledge

43:19.692 --> 43:43.442
the main thing, to be sure that what was passed to 
them was authorized information, and that they

43:19.692 --> 43:43.442
would act on it. This type of coordination. How 
were the relations? Sometimes it got sticky. I

43:51.654 --> 43:53.736
don't mind saying, sometimes it got sticky. Why? 
SAC was a powerful organization. SAC was a

43:58.702 --> 44:00.163
powerful organization. And sometimes there was 
feelings between the two commanders.

44:08.873 --> 44:09.734
What kind of feelings? Hard. Why?

44:18.113 --> 44:22.338
Well, what would you call it?

44:22.358 --> 44:24.861
It would be hard to call it professional jealousy. 
Well, it wouldn't be hard to call it that either.

44:31.430 --> 44:37.297
Both of us had our responsibilities, and both were 
very dominant commanders. Terrific, I admired

44:37.317 --> 44:38.859
both of them. One being Kurt LeMay, and one being 
General Parker, my boss.

44:50.378 --> 44:53.442
Both of them were terrific, and I had no disrespect 
to either one of them. You put two iron-willed men

44:53.462 --> 44:57.187
together, you're going to have some conflict. 
Both of them had a job to do, and they wouldn't take

44:57.207 --> 45:03.276
anything off each other. And both of them did their 
job, and we got the coordination done well. Did

45:08.343 --> 45:11.107
General Partridge complain about LeMay to you? 
No.

45:17.035 --> 45:17.736
And how do you...

45:23.082 --> 45:26.185
They did have their word. It was difficult to plan 
this. And

45:29.429 --> 45:36.697
usually the two commanders gave their 
instructions and the staff carried it out. I think

45:36.717 --> 45:49.210
our biggest problem in ADC, NORAD and CONAD, in 
getting things done and accepted by fact was with

45:36.717 --> 45:49.210
the staff people. Certain individuals in the 
staff undergone that. I don't remember ever

45:52.782 --> 45:58.250
seeing General LeMay and General Partridge 
sitting down and having a word with one another. I

45:58.270 --> 45:58.911
never saw that. As a matter of fact, General LeMay 
had visited our headquarters. He did? Yeah. And we

46:02.937 --> 46:05.000
briefed him. And I don't remember any... Of 
course, you knew him from the old days. Yep. And did

46:10.989 --> 46:12.391
he still remember you? Yep. When he walked in, he 
looked over and said, Hi, Charlie. With a cigar out

46:17.318 --> 46:20.302
of his mouth. How'd you get along with him? Fine. I 
never ain't told anybody. As a matter of fact,

46:25.927 --> 46:31.455
since I retired, he knew I was working with Texas 
Air Force. I'd seen him at Air Force conventions

46:31.475 --> 46:37.244
and all, the Air Force Association meetings, and 
his wife. And we'd speak to each other and enjoy

46:37.824 --> 46:41.470
talking to each other. We'd call him the old time. 
And he's still the same guy. I think he's got a

46:46.377 --> 46:49.922
muscle problem in his face. It's hard for him 
really to laugh. He kind of chuckles. And it's hard

46:53.667 --> 46:55.795
to detect a smile. You have to know him to know that 
he's really laughing.

47:00.773 --> 47:02.800
So there was professional jealousy.
