00:03.220 --> 00:07.106
January 8, 2001.

00:07.126 --> 00:08.468
Can I believe it?

00:08.528 --> 00:09.629
Testing 1, 2, 3.

00:11.892 --> 00:12.934
Testing 1, 2, 3.

00:14.797 --> 00:22.107
This is Monday, January 8, 2001, and I have the honor of being in the Claydesta Center and talk with

00:22.728 --> 00:27.334
Mr. Clayton Williams, Jr., about his Texas A&M recollections.

00:28.275 --> 00:38.287
First, sir, introduce yourself to a stranger that might listen to this, or where did you grow up and your family background?

00:38.468 --> 00:51.604
Well, I could almost say that my journey to A&M began when my father left Fort Stockton on a stagecoach going to Monahan's

00:52.563 --> 01:03.395
in about 1910 or 1911 to catch the train, and he rode the train from Monahan's to Dallas to College Station.

01:03.575 --> 01:16.950
And to this day and time when we go on the road from Monahan's to Fort Stockton, you'll see the stage layover, it was called the Ink Ranch, where my dad obviously stopped and they changed horses on the way to Monahan's.

01:17.521 --> 01:25.232
And that's how, when I gave my talk at the dedication to building, that was, you know, I said, well, how did you come to be an Aggie?

01:25.933 --> 01:30.038
Well, I was an Aggie number one because my father was in the class of 1915.

01:31.821 --> 01:36.648
And there was a football player by the name of Dorbant Barton who went to A&M, who was my idol.

01:36.708 --> 01:40.593
And I followed him playing football, but he was a great player and I was not.

01:41.675 --> 01:43.137
And so that was another reason.

01:43.237 --> 01:47.022
And then the third reason was that I was basically interested in agriculture.

01:47.947 --> 01:51.959
And A&M then and now, you know, such a fine school of agriculture.

01:53.684 --> 01:56.732
So that's how I came basically through my father.

01:58.177 --> 02:01.466
How often had you visited before you went to enroll?

02:01.506 --> 02:02.369
How many times did you?

02:02.549 --> 02:02.850
One time.

02:03.438 --> 02:03.959
One time.

02:03.979 --> 02:05.721
What was your impression of the place?

02:05.741 --> 02:08.325
Well, you know, it was like so many young students.

02:08.365 --> 02:15.756
There were some Fort Stockton boys that were there, and they were juniors and seniors, and they said, it's wonderful, and you should come.

02:15.817 --> 02:23.388
And, of course, for the first freshman year, I really thought there was a bunch of lying SOBs because the first year was pretty tough.

02:24.409 --> 02:27.454
But, yeah, that was further influence, but it still went back to...

02:27.923 --> 02:30.168
my father and that athlete.

02:30.990 --> 02:33.256
And you mentioned your grandfather.

02:35.160 --> 02:42.979
My grandfather was a, actually my grandfather was a, is and was a historian.

02:43.212 --> 02:52.406
He was a young man before, he was born in the mid-1850s, and he actually heard the Lincoln-Douglas debates.

02:52.526 --> 02:55.531
He lived in Carthage, Illinois as a young boy.

02:56.332 --> 02:58.175
He was sent to Harvard to school.

02:58.936 --> 03:10.975
At Harvard he got a law degree, which I'm not particularly proud of that, but he did get an engineering degree so that when he came to Dallas in about 1875,

03:11.647 --> 03:17.413
He came as a lawyer looking for work, and Texas was a great place then because there was no work for lawyers.

03:17.873 --> 03:20.816
But there was work for engineers and surveyors.

03:21.436 --> 03:27.282
So he then made his living as a surveyor surveying the state plains of West Texas.

03:27.302 --> 03:31.266
And in fact, he surveyed the town site in which Lubbock is located.

03:31.786 --> 03:36.631
Lubbock is located in Block O, which is O for his initials, Oscar.

03:37.912 --> 03:40.995
So I had in my background

03:41.380 --> 03:45.104
Education was particularly important, and nearly all of O.W.

03:45.445 --> 03:56.017
Williams' five children, in fact, all of them got a degree, and this is in the 1910, 1920s, you know, where not too many people were able to pursue education.

03:56.658 --> 04:02.965
My grandfather then, after he did the surveying, he went to Silver City, New Mexico, to get rich in the mining.

04:03.526 --> 04:07.911
He didn't get rich in mining, but he made a living as assistant postmaster

04:08.161 --> 04:12.967
Because this was like in 1878, 79, silver gold boom.

04:13.728 --> 04:16.492
And he was the only one in town that could read and write.

04:17.393 --> 04:19.896
So they had to have somebody, obviously, in the mail.

04:19.916 --> 04:23.100
So he made his living there and did prospecting otherwise.

04:23.160 --> 04:27.065
And that was the last days of Geronimo when he was out in that part of the country.

04:27.105 --> 04:29.528
And also Billy the Kid.

04:29.643 --> 04:41.078
My memory is that some days, some people thought because my grandfather then came to Fort Stockton in 1883 from Silver City, New Mexico, that he was Billy the Kid.

04:41.458 --> 04:45.223
But he was not, of course, but there were that type of rumors in those days.

04:45.783 --> 04:47.325
So he was certainly a pioneer.

04:47.406 --> 04:49.809
He was a crack shot with a pistol.

04:49.889 --> 04:51.651
He did early surveying.

04:51.691 --> 04:58.840
He came to Fort Stockton, got a job as deputy surveyor for Pecos County, which was a larger county then than it is today.

04:59.393 --> 05:06.062
In his later years, though, he mostly made a living as a lawyer and representing landowners that lived out of state and so forth.

05:07.624 --> 05:15.774
And that is, they had a book published, Pioneer Surveyor Frontier, Lawyer, which we've looked at here today, was published by Texas Western.

05:16.755 --> 05:23.644
When you were getting ready to go to A&M to enroll, how did you get there on that trip?

05:25.086 --> 05:28.270
That trip, my mother and daddy took me by automobile.

05:29.617 --> 05:41.530
And probably, I'm not sure that I had the grades to qualify, but in that day, the little school, Fort Stockton High School, I think I was short one math course, and they just filled it out and said, go on to A&M and try your luck.

05:41.951 --> 05:44.413
Different type of world, and I never embarrassed them.

05:45.435 --> 05:49.919
And what, as you remember, what kind of stuff did you take with you?

05:49.960 --> 05:50.540
What gear?

05:50.921 --> 05:54.004
Well, you didn't take much gear because they furnished the uniform

05:53.984 --> 05:57.890
He said, you're not going to be needing any clothes to speak of.

05:57.930 --> 06:02.657
The military furnished all our uniforms, which was very helpful because it saved money.

06:03.379 --> 06:07.465
And I do remember my freshman year, I spent $800 total.

06:08.086 --> 06:09.207
I was kind of proud of that.

06:09.228 --> 06:11.591
Now, this was the fall of 19... Fall of 1950.

06:11.651 --> 06:15.016
Fall and spring of 51 then.

06:15.177 --> 06:15.677
All right.

06:15.698 --> 06:16.539
You arrived.

06:16.679 --> 06:20.565
Where were you greeted, and how did you get into a unit?

06:20.545 --> 06:22.267
Well, I wasn't greeted at all.

06:22.307 --> 06:26.192
My mother and dad let me out at the dorm, which was the band dorm.

06:26.252 --> 06:31.998
I was in the band the first year, and that's across from the movie, which is now the Shadow Canyon.

06:32.459 --> 06:33.480
I forget the name of the dorm.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.322
It was dorm four, I believe then.

06:35.923 --> 06:42.250
I kind of walked in all by myself, and it was pretty sad and pretty lonesome, and there wasn't anybody there to greet you, of course.

06:42.972 --> 06:49.765
And I really didn't care for the military, but it did me a lot of good as I look back.

06:49.785 --> 06:49.986
All right.

06:50.006 --> 06:51.689
Someone then assigned you to a room.

06:51.829 --> 06:54.314
I was assigned to a room before I arrived.

06:54.775 --> 06:55.677
So I got out, went.

06:55.697 --> 07:00.306
My mother and dad left, and I walked up to the room, and it was 403.

07:00.346 --> 07:02.550
Well, I don't remember what it was, fourth floor.

07:03.552 --> 07:05.115
And started meeting people.

07:05.939 --> 07:08.842
But there wasn't any particular greeting that I recall.

07:10.743 --> 07:14.447
As the upperclassmen got into it, the greeting was less than what I had hoped.

07:14.707 --> 07:16.048
They weren't really impressed with me.

07:16.749 --> 07:30.922
Describe the process of being, other places would call it oriented, describe the process of becoming a part of the core and all of the rituals and routines.

07:30.942 --> 07:32.963
It was that many years ago.

07:32.983 --> 07:34.765
That was 50 years ago.

07:34.964 --> 07:39.012
They had a good orientation for freshmen.

07:39.853 --> 07:46.186
I recall that they said only one in four of you will be here when you graduate, and that was shocking, and that's where it turned out.

07:46.226 --> 07:55.183
They had a good orientation, and I felt very comfortable with how they lined me out in school at the time.

07:55.923 --> 08:04.076
Of course, you know, you were very quickly involved into the unit, which was the freshman band for the first year.

08:05.278 --> 08:10.045
And very quickly, I was on the bullring, like most outstanding young age should be.

08:10.866 --> 08:14.652
But I had no fault with them not giving me enough information.

08:14.732 --> 08:22.464
And my problem was coming from a small school and hitting courses like chemistry, which I'd never had chemistry, and so on.

08:22.845 --> 08:24.327
I had a devil of a time.

08:25.083 --> 08:30.248
And one of the great events in my life is that I went to the different people in my floor.

08:30.749 --> 08:33.111
One guy was named Mahaney was studying chemistry.

08:33.131 --> 08:34.313
They helped me, helped me, helped me.

08:35.554 --> 08:37.356
And I finally said, nobody can help me.

08:37.396 --> 08:38.857
I've got to go do it myself.

08:39.518 --> 08:40.139
I'll never forget it.

08:40.159 --> 08:42.281
I went back to my room and said, I'm going to learn this.

08:42.822 --> 08:43.402
And I did.

08:43.442 --> 08:49.188
And that developed an attitude that you just focus in and try and work, and you'll work through it.

08:49.248 --> 08:52.812
And that one event was very important in my life.

08:53.332 --> 09:00.964
As you were beginning that freshman year, what was your intended future professional goal?

09:00.984 --> 09:06.574
I intended to become, intended to go back to Fort Stockton, run my dad's ranch and farm.

09:08.096 --> 09:15.969
One of the great things happened while I was in the Army after graduating, me and him, my dad sold the ranch, leased the farm, I was out of work.

09:15.989 --> 09:20.436
So I started selling life insurance and eventually drifted into the oil patch.

09:21.327 --> 09:25.812
and it's a dang good thing because going back to agriculture is a pretty tough way to make a living.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.313
So it was very fortunate.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.155
I'm sure my dad had some of that in mind.

09:29.215 --> 09:32.619
He knew I probably had a better future than to be a cowboy.

09:33.039 --> 09:34.861
Oh, I still like to be a cowboy.

09:34.881 --> 09:40.827
So agriculture was your... Animal husbandry, animal science now was my major.

09:40.947 --> 09:46.253
Were there any important courses that you took that first year as you look back?

09:48.235 --> 09:49.596
Surviving chemistry.

09:49.863 --> 09:54.668
Freshman chemistry was a very important course because I learned I could overcome.

09:55.249 --> 09:57.872
Was there a teacher that helped?

09:58.092 --> 10:01.436
It was a big lecture, you know, three or four hundred students in the lecture.

10:02.437 --> 10:09.084
I do remember some very outstanding teachers, but I don't remember the teacher that lectured freshman chemistry.

10:09.124 --> 10:12.107
I remember it was tough and I did fight it then.

10:12.127 --> 10:15.191
I thought it was going to be my undoing, but I made it.

10:15.211 --> 10:16.452
What about some of the other courses?

10:16.512 --> 10:17.153
Were they...

10:17.403 --> 10:21.308
All the freshman courses were tough because I had not learned to study.

10:22.450 --> 10:24.252
And that's what the Corps did for me.

10:24.492 --> 10:29.119
You had to be at your desk at 7.20 and stay there until 11.20.

10:29.239 --> 10:31.642
Well, I generally stayed until 12.30 or 1.00.

10:32.643 --> 10:38.331
And the learning to study was the first very big step for me at A&M.

10:38.547 --> 10:47.200
And I don't know if I'd been in another school if I'd have done near as well as A&M because of the regularity of the hours, you know, and I developed that regularity.

10:47.300 --> 10:53.368
I study, and then on the weekends I play, and I've done that pretty much ever since that they formed that in me.

10:54.110 --> 10:57.214
All right, what some other people would call hazing.

10:57.481 --> 11:02.346
describe some of the rituals you went through as a freshman in the Corps.

11:02.746 --> 11:11.595
We were the first freshman back on campus after the freshman had been out at the adjunct, the former Bryan Air Base.

11:11.615 --> 11:15.579
I think they probably protected us more at first than they did some later.

11:16.760 --> 11:23.387
The verbal hazing, being a kid that was free and riding horseback and driving a tractor and I ran

11:23.654 --> 11:27.098
I was actually a businessman before I went to A&M.

11:27.198 --> 11:30.541
I resented the verbal hazing.

11:31.062 --> 11:34.686
The physical hazing, we weren't mistreated there, but very little.

11:35.667 --> 11:38.990
I think maybe it was more later, but I only got the board one time.

11:40.312 --> 11:43.415
The hazing wasn't bad.

11:43.495 --> 11:50.843
The verbal mistreatment, I resented it, but I was used to doing things myself.

11:51.076 --> 11:55.242
It was part of the development, and as time went by I understood the need for it.

11:57.364 --> 12:00.028
But I was a little different than many.

12:00.188 --> 12:01.710
I went to A&M with a purpose.

12:02.551 --> 12:07.518
I'd run my dad's ranch, I'd run the farm, and I was trying to solve problems.

12:07.718 --> 12:11.143
There were problems with labor, there were problems with

12:11.613 --> 12:13.295
with the market, there were problems.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.477
And so I went, I had dead aim.

12:15.537 --> 12:16.939
I took dead aim in education.

12:17.219 --> 12:18.080
I went there to learn.

12:18.841 --> 12:24.447
And anything that was interfering with my learning, well, I considered it my enemy.

12:24.487 --> 12:27.910
And like, I didn't stay in the band because I didn't want to waste the time marching.

12:28.651 --> 12:32.695
So I was less than a great core band A&M, but I made very good grades.

12:32.976 --> 12:34.858
But you stayed in the band that first year?

12:34.878 --> 12:35.999
I stayed in the band the first year.

12:36.019 --> 12:36.680
What were you playing?

12:37.060 --> 12:37.941
Played the trumpet.

12:38.647 --> 12:45.501
and I enjoyed the marching, enjoyed the band trips, but I couldn't do, what I wanted to do was learn.

12:46.038 --> 12:49.923
And I couldn't stay in the band and study as much as I thought I needed to.

12:50.524 --> 12:51.806
And I stayed that way through school.

12:52.407 --> 12:59.977
Describe the typical schedule of routine on a weekday for a freshman in the band.

13:00.017 --> 13:02.400
What time did you get up and do what and so forth?

13:02.420 --> 13:06.766
As best I can remember, we got up at 6.30, something like that.

13:06.906 --> 13:15.538
You'd go shower, get dressed, march to breakfast, come back, and then you'd fall out marching formation to breakfast at Spisa Hall.

13:16.092 --> 13:18.997
And then we were pretty well through the day until we'd get back.

13:19.117 --> 13:22.463
And that day, we all had 18 hours.

13:22.503 --> 13:24.226
That was a normal course.

13:24.246 --> 13:27.993
And we went to class a big part of the day with 18 hours.

13:28.373 --> 13:29.896
We had also lab courses.

13:30.657 --> 13:31.719
Chemistry was lab.

13:33.322 --> 13:35.967
Animal science had a good many lab courses.

13:35.987 --> 13:37.830
It took a few extra hours.

13:38.705 --> 13:42.241
Then you get back at 4.30 or 5, whatever.

13:42.362 --> 13:46.420
The time varied some, but then you'd practice marching for a couple of hours.

13:47.767 --> 13:53.135
And then after marching, then you'd follow them, march to Chow, come back, then study.

13:53.256 --> 13:55.479
You were fully occupied, which was great.

13:55.499 --> 13:56.320
I know it should have been.

13:57.162 --> 14:00.747
So during the week, there was virtually no free time for a freshman.

14:01.148 --> 14:03.692
You know, that didn't change a heck of a lot until my senior year.

14:03.752 --> 14:08.439
You know, you were fully occupied, and that's what you went there to do.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.703
You went to study and to work and to learn.

14:10.818 --> 14:17.088
If you were trying to escape from that routine just to relax during the day, was there a place where you could?

14:17.749 --> 14:18.610
Not really.

14:18.931 --> 14:22.697
You know, that was the first year, I think, that they had completed Memorial Student Center.

14:23.438 --> 14:26.563
By the time you'd get to your classes, the campus was scattered out.

14:27.524 --> 14:30.649
There wasn't time, as I recall, for virtually any

14:31.135 --> 14:38.035
of free time, maybe an hour every other day, but I don't think you had an hour a day of free time, as I would call it.

14:38.657 --> 14:40.362
You were pretty well occupied.

14:40.683 --> 14:43.170
And was your fish old lady a special friend?

14:43.640 --> 14:45.182
Did he become?

14:45.282 --> 14:45.963
He did not.

14:46.103 --> 14:51.411
He left after the freshman year and joined the Air Force, and I never heard from him again.

14:51.511 --> 14:58.640
But then my second year became, you know, like most Aggies, your first or second year was a very, very, very dear friend.

14:58.780 --> 15:00.082
Where did you?

15:00.142 --> 15:00.923
Got out of the band.

15:01.084 --> 15:01.805
I got out of the band.

15:01.865 --> 15:04.348
I went into the Air Force.

15:04.835 --> 15:06.116
Squadron 7.

15:06.837 --> 15:07.678
Did it have a nickname?

15:07.978 --> 15:10.441
I don't think it did.

15:10.481 --> 15:13.263
Squadron 7, and they changed it to F Squadron.

15:13.283 --> 15:17.628
It was F Squadron or Squadron 7, and I forget which was first.

15:18.008 --> 15:22.413
But that was really my outfit that I was more comfortable there.

15:24.314 --> 15:33.964
The great friends that I developed basically were there, although there were a couple of guys in the band like Jim Eller I did business with years and years later.

15:34.467 --> 15:38.332
But that was the outfit that I really belonged to at A&M.

15:39.273 --> 15:48.606
When your parents left, that first time, did they give you any advice or give you any instructions just before they drove away?

15:49.187 --> 15:50.969
No, I don't recall it.

15:51.069 --> 15:57.317
We were both real sad because my mother and dad and my little sister, we knew it was the end of that period of my life.

15:57.918 --> 15:58.839
It was very, very sad.

15:59.661 --> 16:00.762
And I was very depressed.

16:01.349 --> 16:03.692
going back up into that old lonesome dorm.

16:03.712 --> 16:04.373
It was sad.

16:05.274 --> 16:08.598
But it, you know, I'm sure every freshman felt the same way.

16:08.759 --> 16:09.219
It was sad.

16:12.884 --> 16:18.331
Your outfit, did you all have any routine in the dining halls?

16:18.932 --> 16:24.319
Well, we had typical freshmen, whether it was a freshman band or any, you wore the napkin as a freshman.

16:24.721 --> 16:26.102
I thought that was a good idea.

16:26.262 --> 16:28.665
I'm such a sloppy eater, I'd lie, I'd wear one yet.

16:29.545 --> 16:41.336
And, you know, you did the square meals, and you called the grub by all the names, you know, past the bull neck and the gun wadding and so forth, which was, that was all fun.

16:41.896 --> 16:53.867
The food was always good, you know, it wasn't anything fancy, but I never left hungry, and of course you had to wait till the upperclassmen got started, and we ate last, so it always had us in a hurry, and it was a little harassment.

16:54.185 --> 16:59.610
going on, but it was also, I didn't call it hazing as much as training.

16:59.890 --> 17:02.533
I wasn't bothered with that part much.

17:02.553 --> 17:07.878
In the first year or so, when you went home and described for your dad what was happening?

17:08.478 --> 17:10.880
He laughed.

17:10.900 --> 17:13.683
I was wondering, did he have any comparisons of what it was?

17:13.703 --> 17:15.144
Well, his was a lot tougher than mine.

17:15.164 --> 17:15.705
Is that right?

17:15.725 --> 17:16.405
Yeah.

17:16.425 --> 17:20.209
When he went to A&M, and that was 1911, his freshman year was in a tent.

17:21.330 --> 17:23.652
They lived in tents at the time, so those stories

17:24.188 --> 17:29.053
The stories he told me of his early days are about as vivid in my mind as my own.

17:29.654 --> 17:31.115
Share some of those.

17:31.135 --> 17:37.442
Yeah, well, some of those, they've got their butt beat with a saber, and that's a lot tighter than that.

17:37.522 --> 17:38.262
It was a lot tougher.

17:38.803 --> 17:45.289
A lot of time, he came in one time on the train, and one of the kids was, the train didn't stop right at College Station.

17:45.830 --> 17:47.752
Dad tried to talk the guy into not jumping off.

17:47.792 --> 17:49.033
He jumped off and was killed.

17:49.834 --> 17:52.677
Dad had to walk around about half a mile, found the body there.

17:53.315 --> 18:19.491
they talked about the Hazen was a lot tougher when he was there and it was physical and he had he got in a fight with one guy with a saber in the dorm and the guy came after him with a saber and he had a bucket and he hit him in the head with a bucket I mean it was pretty serious business when they're having a saber fight they of course it was smaller school I don't know what it was then partway through his schooling then he didn't graduate from A&M that time he left

18:19.943 --> 18:24.512
and volunteered for the service, as the guys did then more than stayed.

18:25.233 --> 18:34.831
And then he went through first officers training in Leon Springs at San Antonio, went into the service, served in France, came back, finished his degree at A&M.

18:34.851 --> 18:37.195
He didn't like it but, you know, a year or something like that.

18:38.037 --> 18:42.525
But it was, his study was electrical engineering.

18:43.231 --> 18:45.454
He played on the football team there at the time.

18:46.095 --> 18:48.158
Of course, it was a smaller school as well.

18:49.139 --> 18:52.003
And the court trips were fun for him as well.

18:52.063 --> 19:00.455
I don't, you know, it wasn't 1914, 1912, 13, 14, there weren't just a lot of folks there.

19:00.555 --> 19:03.619
Again, it was, I remember him saying it was

19:03.987 --> 19:05.209
It was not expensive.

19:05.229 --> 19:09.858
You know, he could get an education where some other place he might not be able to afford it like that.

19:10.639 --> 19:22.000
Did you have the impression from him and his classmates there was the same great pride, that they felt the same great pride that you and your... I think not.

19:22.401 --> 19:24.104
I think it grew more with time.

19:24.124 --> 19:24.625
Oh, okay.

19:24.645 --> 19:26.468
I don't think he had the pride because...

19:27.022 --> 19:30.310
In 1911, really, they hadn't been much of a school for very long.

19:31.032 --> 19:34.100
So many of the traditions were developed after that.

19:34.882 --> 19:40.035
And like the NM, the men that served in World War I, later World War II, they were all building

19:40.268 --> 19:43.113
These traditions, as you mentioned, Earl Rudder, you know.

19:43.894 --> 19:45.356
So, no, they didn't have it.

19:45.497 --> 19:46.999
They didn't have that feeling.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.724
It was developing, but not like when I was there.

19:50.665 --> 19:51.887
Was he by chance in the band?

19:52.288 --> 19:53.430
No, he was not in the band.

19:53.450 --> 19:55.032
I was going to ask for a comparison.

19:55.613 --> 19:57.537
Well, I didn't intend to be in the band.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.061
I just played in the band.

20:00.081 --> 20:02.284
Fort Stockton, you played in the band and played football.

20:02.304 --> 20:03.306
You did everything.

20:03.286 --> 20:06.010
The band was secondary to me to athletics for them.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.773
I liked athletics better.

20:09.854 --> 20:16.343
That first year, how did you and your parents communicate back and forth?

20:16.543 --> 20:16.843
Letters.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.448
They wrote my grandmother, my mother, and particularly my dad.

20:20.488 --> 20:24.914
I got four or five letters a week, and I looked forward to those letters.

20:25.334 --> 20:27.277
That was the day you didn't use a telephone.

20:28.098 --> 20:29.740
We didn't have telephones in the dorm.

20:29.780 --> 20:31.302
If you wanted a phone, you went to the

20:31.568 --> 20:33.351
YMCA was the only phone.

20:33.931 --> 20:37.276
So going to the post office to get your letters was a highlight of the day.

20:38.398 --> 20:49.513
And, you know, that's the kind of thing that we missed because there's a written record of all those letters, which with my kids, mostly we phoned, talked back and forth on the phone.

20:49.534 --> 20:52.197
And no air conditioning in these, as a matter of fact.

20:52.217 --> 20:54.040
It was a hot sun with gun there.

20:54.060 --> 20:56.023
And you didn't have any wheels.

20:57.144 --> 20:58.586
I had wheels my second year.

20:58.606 --> 21:01.170
I had a bicycle first year in the,

21:01.437 --> 21:02.879
Hart Hall was an athletic dorm.

21:02.899 --> 21:05.303
They always stole my bicycle to end up at Hart Hall.

21:06.706 --> 21:10.332
But the wheels came out.

21:10.352 --> 21:15.580
I hitchhiked back in Fort Stockton, which was a long way from being in Fort Stockton.

21:15.600 --> 21:16.582
Describe hitchhiking.

21:16.622 --> 21:18.625
Hitchhiking was something that was pretty neat.

21:18.686 --> 21:22.011
It was almost a badge of honor to hitchhike.

21:22.177 --> 21:24.801
And in that period of time, people would pick up Aggies.

21:25.162 --> 21:26.283
They tended to pick us up.

21:26.404 --> 21:30.090
And so we'd brag on hitchhiking, so to speak.

21:31.211 --> 21:34.056
It took me 36 hours to hitchhike home one time.

21:34.116 --> 21:37.181
And I'd been a pretty successful young man in high school.

21:37.201 --> 21:37.762
I'd made money.

21:37.882 --> 21:39.504
I had my own cotton crops.

21:39.605 --> 21:40.206
I'd farmed.

21:40.306 --> 21:41.788
I had my cattle.

21:42.140 --> 21:47.353
And so I bought a second-hand Chevrolet when I got home the next morning after 36 hours.

21:47.393 --> 21:48.897
I thought, this is not the way to go.

21:48.937 --> 21:54.973
Did you ever have a negative experience as an Aggie hitchhiker?

21:55.714 --> 21:56.657
Anything bad?

21:56.697 --> 21:59.524
The only negative thing I had, I was in Fredericksburg.

21:59.825 --> 22:01.929
And I admitted some Fredericks to Fredericksburg.

22:01.949 --> 22:02.309
You're there.

22:02.350 --> 22:07.639
I'd stop, and some of the high school kids would act like they were going to pick me up, and I'd start running, and they'd drive off.

22:07.659 --> 22:08.481
Oh, oh.

22:08.501 --> 22:11.185
And it rode with a truck driver in Fredericksburg to Ozona.

22:11.205 --> 22:13.009
And then, you know, finally got up.

22:13.069 --> 22:13.750
No, I didn't.

22:14.219 --> 22:22.367
I have not yet had anybody except say, well, the guy was driving a little too fast or he was drinking a little too much.

22:22.527 --> 22:22.627
Yeah.

22:22.808 --> 22:23.468
But those are the words.

22:23.488 --> 22:24.710
Well, you know, we had these fantasies.

22:24.730 --> 22:28.293
Some beautiful girl is going to pick us up in a hitchhiker and take us off to fantasy land.

22:28.313 --> 22:29.995
That sure as heck never happened.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.036
Nobody's ever heard of it.

22:31.476 --> 22:32.978
No, that just wasn't the way that worked out.

22:33.699 --> 22:40.565
In your first year or so, did you and your buddies try any pranks or goodwill?

22:40.585 --> 22:41.106
Yeah, always.

22:41.186 --> 22:41.847
Share some of that.

22:41.867 --> 22:42.167
Always.

22:42.805 --> 22:47.552
My sophomore year, particularly the drowned out, was a great event in those days.

22:47.572 --> 22:51.176
And I'm not sure they'd describe it, but the door opened inward to the room.

22:51.837 --> 22:53.480
It had a large brass handle.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.082
And they had the F stick.

22:55.843 --> 23:04.335
And you cut a little notch in it so you could throw the bucket of water, close the door, flap the stick, and whoever's in there could not get to.

23:05.156 --> 23:07.939
And that's why only the seniors could lock their door.

23:08.941 --> 23:11.985
So sophomores and juniors had to leave their doors open.

23:12.488 --> 23:16.213
If somebody mistreated you too bad, you go drown them out.

23:16.233 --> 23:18.997
And there wasn't much they could do about it, because there'd be two of us.

23:19.538 --> 23:20.119
That was fun.

23:20.179 --> 23:21.160
I loved that part.

23:21.681 --> 23:23.383
Actually, I held a record.

23:23.403 --> 23:27.629
I think nobody's ever drowned out 17 people, and I did one night.

23:27.770 --> 23:28.150
One night?

23:28.531 --> 23:28.871
One night.

23:28.891 --> 23:29.652
That was the spring.

23:30.073 --> 23:35.641
Finally ran out of upperclassmen, so I went over and drowned out my fish buddies for like anybody else.

23:35.661 --> 23:38.545
But you'd get the bucket, and they'd be full of water, and there'd be two of you.

23:39.446 --> 23:42.310
And you're scared, because if they caught you, it'd been hell to pay.

23:43.066 --> 23:47.255
And you'd throw open the door, throw the water, slam the door.

23:47.355 --> 23:52.987
Then you'd get in the bed and you'd hope your heart would settle back down because they'd come check your pulses.

23:54.530 --> 23:55.111
That was fun.

23:55.131 --> 23:55.993
That was good stuff.

23:56.013 --> 23:57.075
Did you ever get caught?

23:57.095 --> 23:58.037
I never got caught.

23:58.675 --> 24:00.777
They're pretty sure I did it, but they never caught.

24:00.797 --> 24:05.623
If anyone did get caught, what was their... Probably more bull ring or the board.

24:06.003 --> 24:06.324
Okay.

24:06.344 --> 24:09.387
The board was illegal, but something like that, they'd use it, and they probably should.

24:09.908 --> 24:15.094
Do you remember any good bull pranks that resulted in someone getting hurt?

24:15.114 --> 24:15.674
No.

24:15.695 --> 24:15.975
I see.

24:16.295 --> 24:16.776
I don't either.

24:17.256 --> 24:18.738
But there have been some occasionally.

24:18.758 --> 24:21.842
We've read of them, but no.

24:21.862 --> 24:25.746
That, I guess, was somewhat of a delicate balance as I look back.

24:25.726 --> 24:29.875
When you drowned somebody out, they probably earned it.

24:30.516 --> 24:33.141
Except that night at 17, I just drowned everybody.

24:33.863 --> 24:38.192
But they generally earned it, and it had a certain counter-discipline.

24:38.913 --> 24:41.018
You know, somebody really started picking on somebody.

24:42.020 --> 24:45.627
And then you could challenge to the boxing gloves, stuff like that.

24:45.647 --> 24:46.890
That didn't happen often because

24:47.225 --> 24:50.688
You might beat them in a boxing ring, but you'd lose again the next day, you know.

24:51.049 --> 24:57.876
And normally the victim of the drowned out was in your outfit.

24:57.896 --> 24:58.256
Generally.

24:59.097 --> 25:00.338
Or if there was some other reason.

25:00.418 --> 25:05.643
And generally it was someone who you thought wasn't just doing this right.

25:05.663 --> 25:08.506
But sometimes it was just plum meanness that came out in us.

25:09.307 --> 25:12.991
And the spring's when it always happens.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.312
As you went to class,

25:15.389 --> 25:21.196
What was the normal code of behavior for an Aggie freshman in class?

25:22.858 --> 25:23.799
Did you go regularly?

25:24.079 --> 25:24.720
Oh, yeah.

25:24.780 --> 25:26.102
You didn't miss class.

25:26.182 --> 25:27.503
School was serious to me.

25:27.944 --> 25:30.347
The ones that did eventually dropped out.

25:30.367 --> 25:32.809
If you didn't take it serious, you didn't make it.

25:32.829 --> 25:36.974
So class was regular and serious, and I didn't cut classes.

25:38.917 --> 25:44.383
Later, like in junior year, I might cut a Friday afternoon class when the grades were good and everything.

25:44.617 --> 25:45.939
It was serious.

25:45.999 --> 25:48.782
I think most kids looked at it that way.

25:48.822 --> 25:50.184
What about going to sleep in class?

25:51.966 --> 25:53.128
Maybe there was some sleeping.

25:53.188 --> 25:54.830
I don't remember much sleeping in class.

25:55.511 --> 26:04.082
Who did you have any person you became acquainted with that first year or so that you turned to for advice?

26:05.163 --> 26:06.405
Who did you go to?

26:06.655 --> 26:07.276
Like R.C.

26:07.296 --> 26:08.057
Potts?

26:09.379 --> 26:11.703
R.C., I had him, yeah.

26:11.723 --> 26:12.123
Oh, really?

26:12.183 --> 26:13.085
Yes, sir, I did.

26:13.105 --> 26:14.727
Oh, describe him as a teacher.

26:15.188 --> 26:16.530
Johnson Grass Potts.

26:17.651 --> 26:20.696
And I knew him after I graduated when he was on Athletic Council.

26:20.916 --> 26:26.525
He was a very good teacher, and he always advocated Johnson Grass as another good feed.

26:27.366 --> 26:30.030
He was a great communicator with the kids.

26:30.820 --> 26:34.805
He would have been somebody to go for advice.

26:34.925 --> 26:35.606
I did not.

26:37.829 --> 26:42.434
There was one person in the military, I can't remember his name, it was some help to me.

26:43.155 --> 26:47.961
Mostly your advice came as you belly ached with your fish buddies.

26:47.981 --> 26:51.765
There wasn't much great communication to an upperclassman or to a senior.

26:52.827 --> 26:59.595
I did have some wonderful professors, though, and it'd be remiss not to cuncle

26:59.862 --> 27:02.885
was one of the two finest professors.

27:02.925 --> 27:03.925
Harry Kunkel.

27:03.945 --> 27:04.606
Oh, describe him.

27:04.626 --> 27:08.369
And he taught me physiology and pharmacology.

27:08.389 --> 27:09.130
He was excellent.

27:09.730 --> 27:13.674
And he was so bright, and he presented in such a way that I just loved his course.

27:14.134 --> 27:15.755
He was excellent.

27:15.775 --> 27:19.078
And the other was an English teacher that taught me public speaking.

27:19.979 --> 27:22.881
And I believe his name was Bird, and he was later on athletic.

27:22.921 --> 27:23.782
Was there a Bird?

27:24.523 --> 27:25.003
I think it was.

27:25.063 --> 27:29.667
And he had a way, he'd say, Mr. Williams, just give a class a few well-chosen words.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.883
And it was the only public speaking course I ever had.

27:32.943 --> 27:38.310
But I took that and I did a lot of speaking over a lot of years from that one three-hour course.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.092
And I believe it was Burden.

27:40.793 --> 27:42.235
And he was excellent.

27:42.655 --> 27:44.318
He was able to draw you out.

27:44.758 --> 27:46.140
He and Kunkel were the top two.

27:46.460 --> 27:47.802
But I had a lot of good professors.

27:47.822 --> 27:51.246
Did you have any courses with a shy man from Orange named O.D.

27:51.286 --> 27:51.607
Butler?

27:51.887 --> 27:52.208
I did.

27:53.049 --> 27:53.810
He was a good teacher.

27:53.850 --> 27:55.612
He wasn't as good as those two, though.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.274
He was a little tougher, a little rougher.

27:57.575 --> 27:58.676
I had meets with him.

27:59.317 --> 28:00.999
So that was more of a lab course.

28:01.059 --> 28:02.140
And he was good.

28:02.881 --> 28:10.630
But he didn't have that zip that, you know, there's an occasional teacher that just brings it out of you, brings you into his course.

28:10.650 --> 28:12.332
And those two were the highlights.

28:12.352 --> 28:14.835
But all my professors were good.

28:14.855 --> 28:17.378
I just don't remember having a bad one.

28:17.699 --> 28:23.245
Did you find the faculty, your instructors, were they available if you wanted to?

28:24.085 --> 28:25.667
to go talk to them?

28:25.887 --> 28:27.609
They were, but we didn't do that much.

28:28.030 --> 28:29.812
I think there's more of that now than there was then.

28:30.453 --> 28:34.778
We were, you take a freshman A&M or sophomore, you're pretty intimidated by everybody.

28:35.479 --> 28:38.142
And so I didn't feel comfortable going to professor as much.

28:38.242 --> 28:44.690
It was, probably there was more of a structure difference then than now probably.

28:44.811 --> 28:49.116
Because my kids talk about going to professor and getting help, and I just never did that.

28:49.136 --> 28:54.042
If I wanted help, I'd go to a classmate or somebody that was better than A&M.

28:54.022 --> 28:56.766
But I mentioned earlier, getting help didn't work for me.

28:56.846 --> 28:58.348
I had to dig it out myself.

28:59.209 --> 29:04.215
Did you, that first year, ever think about dropping out of A&M?

29:04.275 --> 29:04.355
No.

29:04.415 --> 29:05.337
Absolutely.

29:05.677 --> 29:06.578
Please describe that.

29:06.618 --> 29:06.959
Oh, absolutely.

29:06.979 --> 29:07.700
Time and again.

29:08.641 --> 29:12.806
In fact, my first year, I was going to quit.

29:12.826 --> 29:14.889
I didn't like the upperclassmen.

29:14.929 --> 29:16.211
I didn't like the way they was treating me.

29:16.251 --> 29:17.232
I didn't like the military.

29:17.252 --> 29:18.133
I didn't like where I was.

29:18.193 --> 29:20.316
But I wanted to get an education.

29:20.336 --> 29:22.379
I was always quitting.

29:22.399 --> 29:23.320
But I'd also...

29:23.890 --> 29:26.814
I'd also heard that a lot of people quit.

29:26.994 --> 29:28.916
I didn't like the idea of being a quitter.

29:30.098 --> 29:35.764
And so I went home and I went to a math class and somebody stole my overcoat.

29:35.784 --> 29:37.487
Went downstairs, went up to get this going.

29:37.507 --> 29:38.808
I said, well, a bunch of damn thieves.

29:39.329 --> 29:40.430
I'm going to get out of this place.

29:41.511 --> 29:42.312
And I'm going to quit.

29:42.993 --> 29:44.435
I called my dad and said, I'm going to quit.

29:44.475 --> 29:46.337
And he said, OK.

29:46.357 --> 29:47.178
He just told me.

29:47.198 --> 29:48.380
I said, well, I'm going to come home.

29:48.440 --> 29:50.282
I'm going to get the Thanksgiving holiday and I'm going to quit.

29:51.203 --> 29:52.665
Come back to Thanksgiving.

29:52.882 --> 29:55.765
I'm going to get the Christmas holiday, then I'm going to quit.

29:55.805 --> 29:56.586
Well, I'm going to quit.

29:56.606 --> 29:57.767
I'm going to quit at the end of the year.

29:58.528 --> 30:07.597
I got, when I left A&M my freshman year, I got out of the car before, I guess before I called a riot, I gave A&M the finger.

30:07.617 --> 30:09.599
I said, I've never come back this time.

30:09.619 --> 30:11.220
Hell with it.

30:11.240 --> 30:14.724
And I wonder, well, what so-and-so, you know, before it came back.

30:15.725 --> 30:17.006
I spent the first year quitting.

30:17.026 --> 30:18.007
I didn't like it at all.

30:18.127 --> 30:19.969
And there'd be fib to say I didn't.

30:20.489 --> 30:23.813
I really didn't care much for it until the second part of junior year.

30:24.273 --> 30:36.108
But I also could see I was learning, and I was progressing, and I was developing that pride that I really didn't know was developing, proud of being an Aggie, proud of having to work harder.

30:36.208 --> 30:37.810
I had some good friends at the university.

30:37.830 --> 30:38.430
I had to study.

30:39.231 --> 30:42.395
My brains were about like theirs, and I had to study two or three times more than they did.

30:42.455 --> 30:44.558
I didn't know I'm learning more than they are, and I did.

30:45.719 --> 30:49.163
And so it was evolving subconsciously.

30:49.565 --> 30:53.091
I was becoming a dedicated agulist before I knew it.

30:53.672 --> 30:57.119
And your dad by... He didn't tell me I had to stay.

30:57.259 --> 30:58.661
No, he said, okay, that's what he'll do.

30:58.842 --> 31:01.967
And that, in hindsight, that worked better probably.

31:01.987 --> 31:02.268
Oh, yeah.

31:02.368 --> 31:05.474
If he said, okay, quit, he said, okay, quit.

31:06.936 --> 31:10.503
Well, I was wanting to blow some steamer, you know.

31:10.523 --> 31:13.328
He said, all right, if you're not happy there, come on, Mickey go.
