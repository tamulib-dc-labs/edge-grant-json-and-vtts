WEBVTT

00:03.608 --> 00:14.701
Jack punted out of bounds inside the short horns, 20 yard line, three consecutive plays, three consecutive kicks.

00:16.664 --> 00:19.006
And Homer Norton said, you better go play baseball.

00:24.253 --> 00:25.654
Jack was killed in World War II.

00:27.917 --> 00:28.458
Let's see.

00:30.881 --> 00:31.962
Marion Pugh.

00:33.224 --> 00:37.548
Yeah, he was just one of those football players that I didn't know much about.

00:38.509 --> 00:49.240
Let's see, are there some faculty members, if all of the teachers you had were back here, are there some that you'd like to thank, and if so, why?

00:50.401 --> 00:51.282
Mr. Tom Leland.

00:53.604 --> 00:57.628
Mr. Leland was just a wonderful person, he really was.

00:57.668 --> 00:59.890
He was very demanding in the class, but

01:00.393 --> 01:07.785
He was very straightforward, very open with you, and just a super person.

01:08.846 --> 01:18.782
And I guess I would just thank him because, as I mentioned, I was able to cram four years into five here.

01:20.184 --> 01:24.831
And I switched over from ag engineering to accounting.

01:27.612 --> 01:31.678
And Mr. Lee was just, you know, the top man all the way.

01:32.379 --> 01:38.046
And I came back here, through here in 1960.

01:38.367 --> 01:43.314
And he had offices on the second floor of Francis Hall.

01:44.315 --> 01:46.218
And I went in to pay my respects to him.

01:47.920 --> 01:55.290
And he said, I can't call your name, but you were somewhere right around the time with Pete Weiner.

01:55.878 --> 02:00.626
And I don't think I had seen that man since 1941.

02:02.709 --> 02:08.017
And yeah, Pete and I studied together and we're good friends.

02:08.117 --> 02:23.522
And Mr. Leland is the one person, I think, of all of them that I had that sticks out and that, yes, I owe a great deal of thanks to.

02:24.802 --> 02:34.613
Maybe I didn't say it as such, but also I guess that visit back here in 1960 was sort of that, but I wasn't thinking in those terms.

02:34.633 --> 02:38.558
Were there some others, though, that you now remember too, warmly?

02:41.141 --> 02:45.386
No, not really.

02:45.406 --> 02:47.468
Back in those days, I really wasn't.

02:50.384 --> 02:51.707
all that good at that.

02:53.290 --> 02:56.356
Get off of the farm and trying to get out.

02:57.979 --> 03:00.163
Two names you've already mentioned.

03:00.183 --> 03:01.586
One is a fellow named O.D.

03:01.666 --> 03:04.311
Butler from Orange, Texas who was a year ahead of you.

03:04.873 --> 03:10.804
Describe him as a student, as a person, fellow student.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.207
He was a very serious student.

03:15.848 --> 03:16.990
Almost a recluse.

03:18.311 --> 03:25.160
Not really, but freshman, I mean a student in the Corps just couldn't quite be a recluse.

03:25.581 --> 03:28.665
But he would go to his room and study.

03:28.685 --> 03:30.447
And then he would go to the meth hall and work.

03:30.527 --> 03:34.172
And then he'd come back to his room and study or go to class or whatever.

03:34.192 --> 03:37.857
He was just a very dedicated student, a very serious student.

03:39.372 --> 03:42.936
but very demanding too on freshman.

03:43.877 --> 03:56.489
He's caught me one time at an inspection, and I hadn't polished the back of my shoes, the heel of the shoes.

03:57.650 --> 04:04.097
Fish Adams, if you don't do that, I wonder what you do after you go to the bathroom.

04:07.250 --> 04:12.559
You mentioned a postmaster named Teague, and I suspect that was Olin.

04:12.579 --> 04:13.400
Olin Teague, yes.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.646
I don't think he was a postmaster.

04:16.906 --> 04:18.769
He worked at the post office.

04:19.511 --> 04:26.963
And he would, he understood the problem of Freisman, and yeah, he would

04:27.820 --> 04:41.175
I assumed that he would help all like he would help me, but Mr. Teague, I don't remember Mr. So-and-so's combination, his box number 148 or whatever, and could you help me?

04:41.195 --> 04:43.257
And he would go and open it up.

04:44.338 --> 04:46.861
Now, physically, he was a comparatively small man?

04:46.881 --> 04:47.121
Oh, yes.

04:47.522 --> 04:54.089
He was a short person, probably shorter than O.D.

04:54.109 --> 04:54.410
Butler.

04:55.251 --> 04:57.473
Did y'all know him then as Tiger?

04:57.571 --> 04:58.773
No, Mr. Teague.

05:00.955 --> 05:02.217
Let's see, Guyon Hall.

05:02.417 --> 05:05.201
What happened at Guyon Hall?

05:05.221 --> 05:06.242
Why was it important?

05:08.225 --> 05:16.095
Well, that was just where everything of importance happened on campus.

05:19.059 --> 05:20.381
Graduation was held there.

05:20.441 --> 05:23.865
Commissioning was held there.

05:25.685 --> 05:32.033
Entertainment programs were held there, all sorts of extra educational programs on campus.

05:32.554 --> 05:43.968
That was just, Guyon Hall was a forerunner for Rudder Theater, Rudder Complex, the MSC, everything.

05:44.789 --> 05:48.073
And it was at the head of military walk.

05:48.894 --> 05:51.878
Do you remember any famous individuals who came to

05:53.782 --> 05:54.943
Guyon?

05:54.963 --> 05:55.925
No, not as such.

05:59.589 --> 06:02.672
Were there some famous visitors that came to the campus while you were here?

06:03.974 --> 06:06.157
You mentioned the President of the United States a while ago.

06:06.897 --> 06:11.623
Yeah, that's the most famous that I remember as such, yes.

06:13.986 --> 06:14.967
Describe that visit.

06:21.995 --> 06:23.637
The world situation was rather

06:24.950 --> 06:27.072
tenuous at the time, unsettled.

06:28.994 --> 06:45.450
And we were, when you had an advance contract, you knew that you might be involved and we were very pleased that the President of the United States would come down here and visit and inspect us.

06:46.791 --> 06:51.276
I don't remember that there was much security, but there must have been a little bit.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.619
I don't remember that there was a

06:55.426 --> 06:58.630
bulletproof car or anything like that.

06:58.650 --> 07:01.033
And I doubt that there was one.

07:01.053 --> 07:18.153
But he was, being in the Corps, we did not see him not walking but being transported, however, from the car to the reviewing stand.

07:18.854 --> 07:24.100
But he was up there and

07:26.020 --> 07:31.828
And I don't think at the review as such that he had anything to say to us.

07:31.848 --> 07:32.970
Where did the review occur?

07:33.991 --> 07:34.552
Kyle Field?

07:34.893 --> 07:35.554
No, no.

07:36.014 --> 07:39.179
Reviewing on the drill field out there in front of the MSC.

07:39.199 --> 07:39.659
Drill field.

07:40.100 --> 07:40.781
Drill field, yeah.

07:40.801 --> 07:46.449
Were you and your buddies aware of his physical limitations at that time?

07:46.469 --> 07:48.332
Not as such, no.

07:48.352 --> 07:53.479
And as I say, I'm sure that we were not in a position to have seen that

07:54.472 --> 07:56.334
at that time.

07:56.354 --> 08:00.318
If we'd been elsewhere we might have, but at that time we were not in a position.

08:01.619 --> 08:06.764
Let's see, now let's think about the typical A&M student in those days.

08:09.286 --> 08:18.835
The typical A&M student, what were their attitudes, their habits, their background and so forth?

08:18.855 --> 08:21.998
What were of

08:24.307 --> 08:31.076
rather meager backgrounds financially because of the era that we were in.

08:31.657 --> 08:43.812
We had the project houses where students could come from the rural areas and bring their own chickens or cows or pigs or something and live.

08:46.176 --> 08:54.246
But those were, numeric wise, those were not as,

08:55.795 --> 08:59.801
large by any means of those who were living in the core dorms.

09:01.223 --> 09:12.660
But, and the person who had an automobile was kind of out of the ordinary.

09:14.723 --> 09:24.958
We had one freshman in our outfit that had a car and

09:28.347 --> 09:35.879
That's the way I went to the Rice football game was in his car and it stopped on the way back then.

09:37.762 --> 09:50.862
But most were just serious young kids trying to get an education and being able to

09:52.613 --> 09:56.517
for a large part, I was, get out of the financial position that our parents were in.

09:57.258 --> 09:59.400
Geographically, where were Aggies from?

10:01.282 --> 10:02.483
Just mostly Texas.

10:02.503 --> 10:04.205
No, but small towns, big cities?

10:04.225 --> 10:05.026
Oh, yeah, small towns.

10:05.667 --> 10:06.628
Small towns.

10:08.450 --> 10:10.412
Except E-Battery from San Antonio.

10:11.253 --> 10:17.920
Oh, we, one of my roommates my freshman year was from Houston, yes.

10:17.940 --> 10:21.844
And there was a,

10:23.005 --> 10:30.414
Two guys from Wichita Falls, I don't remember anybody my freshman year from Dallas.

10:30.434 --> 10:34.459
We had one the next, my sophomore year from Dallas, Dave Fitch.

10:35.220 --> 10:39.185
He was up at North Texas for a good little while.

10:41.368 --> 10:45.553
But most were from the smaller towns.

10:46.681 --> 10:52.046
And in general, they were economically not very blessed.

10:52.066 --> 10:52.527
That's right.

10:55.590 --> 10:59.894
How diverse was the student body in today's definition of the word diverse?

11:06.260 --> 11:10.764
The students today would probably not call us a diverse student body.

11:11.024 --> 11:14.848
Were there some Catholic boys that you knew?

11:16.432 --> 11:21.339
Well, there were some Catholics, I don't know for sure that I knew them, identified them as such.

11:21.359 --> 11:22.822
Were there Jewish students?

11:23.002 --> 11:23.723
Oh, yes.

11:23.743 --> 11:24.484
Pincus Brunus.

11:26.367 --> 11:32.256
And he would say, pour ketchup and say, hereby I christen thee beef.

11:32.276 --> 11:33.738
And what was his name?

11:34.239 --> 11:39.206
Pincus, P-I-N-C-U-S, Brunus, B-R-U-N-E-S, to living in Houston.

11:39.327 --> 11:40.649
Oh, that wasn't a nickname?

11:40.669 --> 11:42.411
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:42.431 --> 11:42.912
That's his name.

11:42.892 --> 11:43.633
Real name.

11:43.773 --> 11:45.936
Did y'all have a nickname for him?

11:45.956 --> 11:46.597
Pinky.

11:46.617 --> 11:48.440
Pinky.

11:48.881 --> 11:52.426
One other little incident.

11:53.027 --> 12:04.063
Right across the hall from me, Leldon Beard, Harold Dyke, and Robert Black lived, freshmen.

12:04.103 --> 12:05.625
Robert Black didn't take a bath.

12:08.626 --> 12:12.752
Weldon and Harold don't remember that he ever took a bath.

12:15.296 --> 12:31.338
So between, just before Christmas, out there in between law and prayer, we ganged up on him and gave him a bath.

12:33.982 --> 12:36.726
Hard to give that guy a bath because he was pretty strong.

12:39.170 --> 12:45.036
He came back after Christmas to midterm and then withdrew.

12:45.677 --> 12:46.397
Never came back.

12:49.340 --> 13:02.554
That kind of freshman policing freshman in one context, if you want to say that, or ousting somebody you didn't like or whatever, but anyway.

13:03.235 --> 13:05.397
Did you know some Hispanic students?

13:08.077 --> 13:09.900
Not particularly.

13:09.920 --> 13:16.310
I don't know that there were anything except Caucasian, really.

13:17.071 --> 13:21.518
Did you by chance know any of the Kishi boys?

13:22.540 --> 13:27.127
Over in my home county of Orange, there was a Japanese-American family named Kishi.

13:28.009 --> 13:31.454
No, but there were Japanese-American there.

13:32.556 --> 13:33.257
Tai Kobashi.

13:34.942 --> 13:38.527
From down below Houston, a vegetable truck farmer.

13:40.970 --> 13:44.375
And how was he treated?

13:44.395 --> 13:45.797
Just like anybody else.

13:45.917 --> 13:47.219
Did he have a nickname?

13:47.239 --> 13:48.320
Did y'all give him a nickname?

13:48.701 --> 13:50.763
No, just Ty.

13:52.025 --> 14:00.797
And their vegetable farm is where that Gulf,

14:02.802 --> 14:06.806
Shopping mall, Gulfgate, yeah.

14:08.789 --> 14:10.050
He doesn't raise vegetables anymore.

14:10.090 --> 14:13.374
I don't know whether he's still alive or not.

14:13.394 --> 14:32.134
But we did, I'm sure that there was probably another, Puerto Rican, Reyes and Danny Soto.

14:34.004 --> 14:44.180
that were here, but mostly it was just Texans.

14:44.200 --> 14:51.251
There was one guy from New Jersey, Keith Dahl, D-A-H-L, but he was.

14:51.271 --> 14:57.902
Did he have a nickname?

15:00.852 --> 15:05.341
The students as such, I don't remember very many of them having a nickname.

15:05.381 --> 15:09.750
Yeah, I mentioned Billy Greenwald earlier.

15:09.770 --> 15:12.415
He had a nickname, Gravel Throat.

15:12.435 --> 15:13.778
He had a, I don't know, something.

15:15.100 --> 15:19.649
And he was Gravel Throat and, but O.D.

15:19.689 --> 15:20.791
Butler was just O.D.

15:20.872 --> 15:21.072
and

15:23.600 --> 15:24.942
Oh, yeah.

15:24.962 --> 15:26.885
Let's see, religious activities.

15:27.726 --> 15:31.671
Were there religious organizations on the campus or around the campus then?

15:31.691 --> 15:44.730
Yes, there was a Baptist Student Union and I'm sure there were others, Methodist,

15:46.550 --> 15:53.079
They didn't seem to be quite as active then as I know some of them are right now.

15:54.020 --> 16:06.297
They might have, it might have been also my rebellion too because I was, I didn't get involved in it really in those days.

16:07.593 --> 16:09.856
I guess I kind of hate to say this, but it's the truth.

16:11.058 --> 16:19.409
Two times that I went to church my five years here were to the Catholic Church because my date was Catholic.

16:23.755 --> 16:25.057
DeWare Fieldhouse.

16:26.118 --> 16:28.261
Describe it and what all went on there.

16:28.321 --> 16:28.602
Okay.

16:29.623 --> 16:33.088
Let me go back a little earlier than that.

16:33.268 --> 16:36.773
The other side of DeWare was a fish gym.

16:38.255 --> 16:42.401
wooden structure.

16:42.421 --> 16:48.390
And over there you knew when you were out of bounds because you would hit the wall.

16:48.410 --> 16:56.402
And so when we would come over into DeWare to play the varsity or something, that was a big treat.

16:57.283 --> 17:04.414
But DeWare was the center of all of the athletics and

17:05.643 --> 17:09.854
any of the indoor type intramurals that we had to have.

17:12.620 --> 17:21.643
And in the basement was where all of the dressing rooms were and Sarge and his

17:23.041 --> 17:28.228
supply of towels and soap and stuff like that and the uniforms.

17:28.288 --> 17:37.740
And we would dress in the basement and go up to the main floor for the activities.

17:38.121 --> 17:44.870
And it was a very close environment.

17:46.632 --> 17:49.656
But one night,

17:51.627 --> 17:53.308
Mr. Charlie DeWear Sr.

17:53.789 --> 17:58.893
was there, and I got the privilege of meeting him.

17:58.913 --> 18:00.214
And he was a wonderful gentleman.

18:00.255 --> 18:10.263
The father of Charlie DeWear, Charlie was just a little bit older than me, I don't know, class of 36 or something like that.

18:10.684 --> 18:14.427
But anyway, Mr. Charlie, Charlie DeWear Sr.

18:14.447 --> 18:21.533
was a very fine gentleman, and it was an honor to meet him, and to meet him in DeWear Fieldhouse, too.

18:23.335 --> 18:30.126
Did you and your buddies go to games together at DeWare Fieldhouse, basketball games?

18:31.468 --> 18:34.893
I was on the team most of the time, even though I didn't let her.

18:35.755 --> 18:40.722
But yes, you would go as a unit, essentially.

18:42.044 --> 18:45.630
And for those who were going, it was not...

18:46.387 --> 18:54.461
there was not as much stress on attending basketball games or baseball games as there was on football games.

18:55.283 --> 18:58.969
But football games, you essentially vacated the dormitory.

19:00.152 --> 19:10.470
And, but yeah, most of the time there would be two or three, three or four, whatever, from the same outfit sitting together, yes.

19:11.142 --> 19:18.792
Describe what it was like to go out for basketball in that era, the routine and travel and so forth.

19:20.714 --> 19:22.416
Travel was by automobile.

19:25.440 --> 19:33.690
We went, for instance, when we went to Arkansas to play, we would go to Dallas and play SMU.

19:36.978 --> 19:44.549
and then pick up the referee and drive with him to Fayetteville to play basketball.

19:45.411 --> 19:58.130
Ziggy Sears was later was a renowned baseball umpire, but he was the referee for us most of the time in Fayetteville.

19:58.150 --> 20:01.895
And we picked him up in Dallas and took him up there and then brought him back to Dallas.

20:02.657 --> 20:04.960
But he,

20:07.336 --> 20:12.205
He would not tolerate, we got no advantage from that whatsoever.

20:13.587 --> 20:17.134
But one time up there, we were getting beat pretty badly.

20:18.436 --> 20:24.788
And Dog Dawson would hold Freeburger's, Freeburger played for him.

20:25.038 --> 20:26.179
Arkansas.

20:26.199 --> 20:33.909
Dog would catch his pants and hold him down and he would complain to Ziggy Sear, shut up and get to playing basketball.

20:33.949 --> 20:34.569
I'm refereeing.

20:35.190 --> 20:38.754
But only because they were well ahead would he not call that.

20:39.475 --> 20:42.519
But because he let us have some fun too.

20:43.520 --> 20:49.527
But football, I mean basketball was essentially

20:50.367 --> 21:05.450
a walk-on sport are for those football players that the football coach wanted to get some more physical fitness or agility or whatever might come from it.

21:05.530 --> 21:11.259
And so the basketball coach would have to honor that.

21:11.279 --> 21:14.344
So there were few, if any, basketball scholarships?

21:16.026 --> 21:18.450
I would guess that there were two, maybe.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.975
Sammy Dwyer, and I don't think Woody Varner as captain got any either.

21:23.836 --> 21:24.416
I'm not sure.

21:24.536 --> 21:27.579
Woody might have gotten a partial, but who was the head coach?

21:28.940 --> 21:47.256
Hub McQuillan, and he went from here to TCU, but he was the coach, and Manning Smith coached the freshman and would assist at times with a varsity.

21:47.616 --> 21:48.977
For instance, when

21:49.227 --> 21:51.169
the football team was playing in the Sugar Bowl.

21:54.192 --> 22:03.162
We had no coach here with us, because they had to be over there with him to help as assistants over there for whatever reason.

22:03.822 --> 22:12.872
And, but Coach McClellan left instruction on what all we were to do, and Woody made sure that we did it.

22:14.573 --> 22:20.341
How big a crowd came to home games usually?

22:25.228 --> 22:30.495
Maybe a thousand, two thousand, I don't know, not very large at all.

22:32.738 --> 22:41.290
The band was over there and whatever, that would be on the south side and whatever paid

22:42.907 --> 22:47.973
people would be on the north side, and then the students would fill in around that.

22:49.255 --> 22:58.426
Describe the routine of a typical home football game Saturday.

22:58.446 --> 23:02.732
What time did you all get up, and what did you do, and so forth?

23:02.752 --> 23:06.817
Well, the difference in the routine really started around noon time.

23:07.678 --> 23:09.420
So, you know, we had classes in the morning,

23:10.075 --> 23:18.191
And then if there were a busload of girls or something coming, they would come in, you know, sometime up close to lunchtime.

23:20.215 --> 23:28.691
But you always cleaned up your rooms because you didn't know who might be coming by and visit, so that was extra for you.

23:28.712 --> 23:32.539
And then we would march in to...

23:33.768 --> 24:01.530
as usual, but there would be other people around, parents of somebody, and you tried to really appear good in the military sense in the march-in, but then after meal, that's when the visit and the meeting with people and everything else would start to take place, and that's when people would start

24:02.354 --> 24:05.499
milling around to go to the football game.

24:06.600 --> 24:13.810
And they usually started at 2.30 in the afternoon, no lights, no TV, no nothing like that.

24:14.932 --> 24:22.523
And freshmen would try to get down to the,

24:23.262 --> 24:31.471
field as early as they could so that they could get the best seats that they could in the lower portions of it.

24:31.972 --> 24:35.556
Seniors back up top.

24:35.576 --> 24:36.857
Freshmen were down front.

24:36.877 --> 24:44.506
Now how could a freshman reserve keep that seat and then come back and participate in the march in?

24:45.087 --> 24:46.208
They couldn't.

24:46.228 --> 24:47.890
Oh.

24:49.011 --> 24:52.375
We didn't have all that many march ins.

24:53.333 --> 24:57.337
We just gathered down there, and we would gather by unit mostly.

24:57.357 --> 25:10.429
But the march in for the meal was the main march in as far as I'm concerned and remember mostly.

25:10.449 --> 25:11.690
I don't remember that we marched.

25:12.111 --> 25:21.940
Oh, I'm sure that there were some times when we did march and go through some sort of a reviewing stand there, but that was not the norm.

25:22.848 --> 25:27.393
just gather, and family and everything else.

25:27.413 --> 25:37.603
Were there some football game traditions that you all observed then that have changed?

25:37.623 --> 25:49.675
Nothing other than some of the yells, like rooty-toot-toot, rooty-toot-toot, we're from the institute, you know, rice, things like that.

25:51.236 --> 25:52.838
What was the Baylor yell?

25:56.395 --> 25:57.697
I don't know.

25:57.717 --> 26:07.371
And I've been told that the Gig'em Aggies may have been a spin-off about Gig Those Frogs.

26:09.474 --> 26:14.001
Do you remember the TCU yell?

26:14.021 --> 26:18.387
I understand that it had something to do with Gig Those Frogs.

26:19.700 --> 26:24.446
and that Pinky Downs kind of emphasized the gigum.

26:24.826 --> 26:25.767
That might have been.

26:27.029 --> 26:28.630
Pinky was a little bit before my time.

26:30.232 --> 26:31.714
Let me also go back to Baylor.

26:33.196 --> 26:47.192
I believe it was while I was here that we renewed athletic rivalry with Baylor because of that student that was killed up there at the ball game.

26:48.877 --> 27:02.177
I don't remember exactly how many years, as far as I know, I remember the entire athletic competition between the two schools was nonexistent.

27:04.975 --> 27:11.365
But, and I do not remember going to Baylor to a football game at all.

27:12.126 --> 27:14.249
I do not remember Waco whatsoever.

27:15.010 --> 27:23.663
San Antonio, Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, and so on, yes, and even Fayetteville, but Baylor, no.

27:23.683 --> 27:29.953
Describe a field, a court trip.

27:33.089 --> 27:35.552
You would try to take off on Friday as soon as you could.

27:36.733 --> 27:37.694
Forget Saturday.

27:39.576 --> 27:50.267
And one that I remember specifically going to San Antonio, I don't remember the exact game, but it was in the fall of 40.

27:51.568 --> 28:00.818
And I don't know who we were playing, but there was some friend that had a, from San Antonio,

28:02.637 --> 28:13.630
And we went through Austin and stopped on the drag, showed off our boots and everything else over there, and then went on to San Antonio.

28:16.033 --> 28:25.304
I don't know how many spent the night that night at his house, but we essentially took turns sleeping.

28:25.324 --> 28:26.485
And then,

28:27.545 --> 28:29.808
Saturday morning assemble downtown.

28:30.929 --> 28:54.075
I don't remember the exact location but gather down there and by 9 or 9.30 something like that and start forming into organizations and probably around 10 o'clock start your march for the parade and as soon as you got back to the

28:55.557 --> 29:03.706
rendezvous area would be dismissed and you were free to go your own way for lunch and then assemble at the ball game.

29:06.769 --> 29:15.159
And that weekend, I did not take off my senior boots.

29:15.179 --> 29:20.465
And I had to have it as either two or three freshmen when I got back there to get those boots off.

29:20.485 --> 29:25.210
And I never did that again like that.

29:27.502 --> 29:36.052
That was the same type of thing would hold true in Austin.

29:36.072 --> 29:39.136
As I said, I don't remember Waco at all.

29:39.156 --> 29:40.478
I know it was true in Houston.

29:40.598 --> 29:47.186
I think I could take you to the place where we would congregate, meet.

29:47.506 --> 29:49.048
In Fort Worth and Dallas.

29:49.068 --> 29:51.190
And then the same type in Fort Worth and Dallas.

29:51.571 --> 29:55.956
Now my brother, brother just older than me, marched in Waco.

29:57.826 --> 30:07.514
and got his heel of his shoe caught in urban tracks, streetcar tracks, and lost the heel of his shoe.

30:08.595 --> 30:17.262
So based on that, I guess that the rivalry had started before I came down here, but I remember some things about it.

30:18.303 --> 30:23.908
Do you remember any negative experiences of court trips, or were they all pretty good?

30:25.910 --> 30:27.411
They were all pretty good.

30:27.880 --> 30:32.745
We were treated very respectfully in most places.

30:33.866 --> 30:42.914
Oh, you know, there would be some cat calling here and there, like over in Austin, but no, the population as such treated us very well.

30:44.456 --> 30:57.128
And for those who went out at night and caroused a little bit, the cops were very, as I understood it, were helpful to them and not,

30:58.357 --> 31:06.688
Not like, because it was not like, say, the UTOU situation in Dallas at all.

31:09.432 --> 31:11.935
Describe hitchhiking as an Aggie.

31:12.415 --> 31:12.696
Oh, yeah.

31:15.139 --> 31:23.470
Well, we would start out at Eastgate, and you had a

31:25.576 --> 31:29.800
depending upon when you arrived, was your order of rank out there.

31:30.380 --> 31:32.862
There was no rank by class.

31:33.963 --> 31:41.550
The first one there was number one, and the second one there was number two, regardless of whether they were freshmen or seniors.

31:41.570 --> 31:48.396
And whoever the number one and two guys were, usually both of them, would stand out by the edge of the road.

31:49.877 --> 31:54.081
And there was also a place in Bryan that headed north.
