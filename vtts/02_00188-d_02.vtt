WEBVTT

00:02.647 --> 00:04.950
And she didn't give it up for a long time. She

00:06.091 --> 00:16.144
had a roper with a gas stove with an oven on it. So 
that was when we were uptown then. Alright, your

00:24.175 --> 00:25.957
freshman year went okay. Do you remember what you 
did at the end of that summer after you were a

00:25.997 --> 00:30.763
freshman?

00:33.899 --> 00:37.443
I don't know whether it'd be 33. Most likely we went 
to Indianapolis. So you traveled? We traveled.

00:46.093 --> 00:46.393
All right. Because Dad had to go to, he was 
Secretary and Treasurer and the insurance

00:47.254 --> 00:55.663
business was a big part of that. Was it better to be a 
sophomore at A&M than to be a freshman? It didn't

01:01.230 --> 01:02.952
make a difference to me. It didn't? How did your 
routine in the Corps change? Well, see, I quit the

01:08.904 --> 01:12.308
Corps in... Well, but you were in it two years. Two 
years, well, no.

01:17.093 --> 01:21.098
I was a day duck, and they just tolerated me. About 
how many day ducks were there, I reckon? There was

01:24.321 --> 01:30.488
probably not more than 15, so there were not very 
many. And the... The only way you'd get out would be

01:31.510 --> 01:41.320
to

01:31.510 --> 01:41.320
have had previous military service. Or you 
couldn't qualify. Or you lived near the campus.

01:44.783 --> 01:45.064
No. Oh. Well, the only way you'd get out of the 
military. Oh, oh, oh, the military. Was those two.

01:55.995 --> 01:59.138
It was to have previous service or you

01:59.776 --> 02:07.427
couldn't make the physical specifications. But 
though you could be a day duck if you lived in the

02:07.447 --> 02:11.372
community, couldn't you? Yeah.

02:15.177 --> 02:17.761
You didn't change your major, you stayed with 
that. Did you ever think about changing your

02:18.822 --> 02:20.685
major? Were there some special courses you had as a 
sophomore? Some special people? Oh yeah, we had

02:30.370 --> 02:53.300
one I remember was in,

02:30.370 --> 02:53.300
what would you call it, about

02:30.370 --> 02:53.300
genes in people and animals. See, I'd take a bunch 
of courses about cattle even chickens and things

02:59.733 --> 03:04.339
like that. We had to do that and rinse with the 
cattle. And then, what do you call it? They had a

03:17.274 --> 03:21.579
special, they did nothing but teach that. 
Genetics? Genetics. genetics. And I enjoyed

03:27.411 --> 03:28.493
that. I enjoyed that. Did you ever have a chemistry 
course from M.T. Harrington? No, I had it from...

03:33.600 --> 03:38.887
No. I knew him. I knew him. Describe him. Tall 
fella. I always thought... Pleasant

03:47.439 --> 03:48.521
personality? Yeah. He always... He always 
talked. I always remembered who I was. And Mrs.

03:57.451 --> 03:59.754
Harrington always a lady? I never did have a lot of 
contact with her, but I knew who she was. While you

04:10.046 --> 04:20.297
were an A&M undergraduate, were there any 
students here whose parents were famous, rich,

04:10.046 --> 04:20.297
important? No, but in Tarleton I did. Who? I don't 
know who they were. Oh. I taught, see I taught ag

04:30.152 --> 04:38.664
engineering in Tarleton from 35 to 37 for two 
years. And I taught and

04:38.684 --> 04:51.702
had to teach farm shop, all the ag engineering 
courses, what they had that they wanted, and So I

04:52.255 --> 05:02.165
was in that farm shop, and we had a lot of kids that 
came from the western part out there. And this

05:02.205 --> 05:07.611
young man, he knew what he was doing. And so I just 
asked him, I said, son, how big a farm do you have? He

05:15.879 --> 05:18.702
said, we got a small one. ranch 24-6.

05:33.229 --> 05:36.193
Describe the student body when you were a student 
here. Describe the A&M student body. Where were

05:39.197 --> 05:40.139
they from? What kinds of families? What kinds of 
attitudes? They brought a whole bunch of people

05:44.705 --> 05:48.250
in. All the...

05:48.803 --> 06:03.461
Well, they had some what they called co-op houses. 
Now those were real good pieces. That was real

06:08.367 --> 06:09.388
good. Because what that did That brought a lot of 
people to A&M that never would have gotten here in

06:13.812 --> 06:21.142
the first place. And what it did, now, one of my, one 
of the, we had,

06:21.302 --> 06:37.763
there were five of us that really were in A&M. And 
Thompson was one of them. but he couldn't get the

06:43.715 --> 06:53.668
mass, so he went into

06:43.715 --> 06:53.668
agriculture. But his mother, they were from 
Throckmorton. Throckmorton. They came from

07:02.240 --> 07:03.882
Throckmorton County. And she ran the house. The 
co-op house. And they shipped in All sorts of food.

07:15.970 --> 07:20.715
Everything that they could, you know. And they 
tried to keep them again. And you could get a pretty

07:22.617 --> 07:27.982
good job around here at 25 cents an hour. And make 
some money. I know I made enough to pay my way all the

07:32.547 --> 07:35.810
way through. All the fees. In general, was the 
typical student body, were there some city boys

07:40.415 --> 07:47.066
and country boys? They had some city people in 
them. From where primarily? What cities? I don't

07:52.635 --> 07:53.176
know. We didn't make much difference about that.

08:00.428 --> 08:04.074
Most of them were plain old boys that come off the 
farm. And... Was there a variety of their

08:07.482 --> 08:16.872
backgrounds, of their ancestry, and where they 
went to church? Were there some German boys and

08:18.574 --> 08:22.498
Catholic boys and Lutheran boys? All of those 
people put in

08:24.160 --> 08:35.292
these places they've got up here for, you know, the 
Methodists. They have one there. I know the

08:37.030 --> 08:40.554
Baptists do, and the Lutherans do too. And the 
Catholics, I think they have one up there. But they

08:44.158 --> 08:52.266
kept houses open for the students, even though 
they were in the dormitory. In terms of attitude,

08:52.567 --> 08:57.011
would we have said they were liberal or 
conservative? Very conservative. Hardworking?

09:00.355 --> 09:02.117
Hardworking. But they're all Democrats. Well, in 
that day, there weren't any Republicans around

09:04.688 --> 09:08.213
here. That's right. And you know why, don't you? 
Franklin Roosevelt. No. In my family, I know why.

09:16.584 --> 09:17.005
No. My family thought Franklin Roosevelt saved 
the country. Well, I didn't think much of his

09:20.289 --> 09:27.439
domestic product.

09:31.402 --> 09:39.151
They took the job of resettlement three years up in 
Dallas. But what got me was when I read a book called

09:39.171 --> 09:47.240
Marching Orders by Lee. And they described 
Roosevelt in there. And he was the guy in line

09:52.586 --> 09:57.852
behind all of that military.

09:57.872 --> 10:00.835
He was the one that took He really did a job there. 
But now the other reason is the treatment we got

10:06.375 --> 10:16.731
after the Civil War. Oh, yes. I agree. The parents 
and grandparents. Yeah, but you see the Negroes

10:24.223 --> 10:29.691
got into the Republican Party. And so everybody 
else was a Democrat. That's right. But the

10:34.590 --> 10:44.184
Democrats we get, except for a few, which I know is 
the yellow... Yellow dog. Yellow dog Democrats.

10:47.149 --> 10:49.312
They're the ones way off on the side. But if you take 
the regular ones, they're nothing but

10:49.332 --> 10:56.263
Republicans. And that's why the change over here 
recently has been So complete. Yes. Back to the

11:03.904 --> 11:05.065
student body. Were there any rich kids? Oh, yeah. 
In terms of being accepted, did any of those

11:09.689 --> 11:16.556
differences matter to being an Aggie at that 
point? Why was everybody so accepted? That's a key

11:22.621 --> 11:23.982
part of A&M. Why was that?

11:29.107 --> 11:29.547
Well, They beat the hell out of

11:31.197 --> 11:36.609
you. Was it also that everybody went through some 
of the same experiences? That's right. That's

11:42.363 --> 11:43.345
right. They're all in it together. Do you remember 
many people dropping out of school? Oh, yeah.

12:01.100 --> 12:02.682
Were those the separator courses? No, chemistry. 
Chemistry separated a bunch of them. The biggest

12:12.137 --> 12:15.762
thing we've got so far is blend. We can sell it. When 
did you start using your slide rule? When you were

12:25.917 --> 12:27.079
taught it. When? When you were a freshman. Right, 
but you didn't use one in high school? No. And do you

12:34.910 --> 12:36.431
remember when you got yours? Yeah, still got it. 
It's a duplex love load. And did you wear it on your

12:42.857 --> 12:45.459
belt proudly? Yeah. Was that a kind of a mark of an 
engineer? Yeah,

12:51.945 --> 12:56.449
you had to have it. It's a kind of a... It's the 
equivalent of today's computer. It is a computer.

13:08.876 --> 13:09.937
Sure, sure. I've

13:11.158 --> 13:19.827
got one that's even better.

13:22.790 --> 13:23.351
How much is that? It's a big one like that, 
circular. Oh, yes. Now, for when you're in the fan

13:32.434 --> 13:40.206
business, like I was for 60 years, you just flip it 
around. I mean, it'll do what this thing does. Now,

13:46.055 --> 13:51.163
in athletics, you guys went to Kyle Field. Was 
DeWare Fieldhouse already here when you were a

13:51.304 --> 13:57.413
student? When was it built? I would think in the 
early 20s. Oh, but when you were an undergraduate,

14:01.923 --> 14:07.731
when you were a student here, it was... Already 
built. Describe going to games, you and your

14:08.332 --> 14:13.619
buddies, when y'all went to game in DeWare 
Fieldhouse. Oh, I don't know. It was just a big old

14:15.863 --> 14:17.104
place. Did y'all make noise? Oh, yeah. What were 
the yell-eaters like then? Boy, they were

14:26.818 --> 14:27.679
something. They were, they were some, and they 
were picked out right. They were picked out right.

14:35.496 --> 14:46.727
You had, and you had, that student organization 
was set up by the, by the military. And those

14:48.609 --> 14:54.035
officers, those military officers made that 
thing run.

14:56.837 --> 14:58.459
And I'll give you an example of it.

15:02.118 --> 15:06.524
You know they got this march to the river that they 
did there? You know what ever happened before? I

15:10.650 --> 15:11.411
don't see it.

15:14.356 --> 15:21.245
It happened in those dormitories across from the 
Y. There were 32 of them in there. And Major Sloan

15:26.072 --> 15:29.998
was the officer in charge.

15:39.463 --> 15:43.689
And he was from the Naval Academy. He wasn't from, 
he was from the Naval Academy. But he couldn't go

15:48.435 --> 15:49.898
aboard ship. He couldn't, he just couldn't make 
it. So they transferred him to the artillery.

16:04.454 --> 16:07.939
She was a good woman, but tough too. They all are. 
And so they would have had a big fling ding up there

16:12.525 --> 16:22.659
in that courtyard in between that thing. They were 
just raising all kinds of hell. And the major went

16:27.365 --> 16:32.352
up there and, oh, somebody called him. We called a 
major, and so he went up there. He told the cadet

16:35.779 --> 16:42.767
officers to quiet this thing down and let's get it 
in order. And he just, that's all he did. He just

16:47.974 --> 16:49.496
issued an order and walked off. And so they didn't. 
And so somebody called him again.

17:05.221 --> 17:14.154
And he walked up there and he said, he told those 
student officers, fall out, all of them,

17:05.221 --> 17:14.154
everything. He called them out. He marched those 
kids in formation all the way to the river.

17:28.135 --> 17:29.717
That's where that got started. That's where it got 
started. And that would have been about when?

17:33.923 --> 17:35.025
During your student years? Yeah, it might have 
been. It probably was, it probably was.

17:44.460 --> 17:52.973
And so that's where they really got,

17:44.460 --> 17:52.973
and he marched and turned them around, marched 
them back. They got back ready in time to go to

17:53.755 --> 17:57.480
breakfast. When you were a student, did the Corps 
ever do anything that was rebellious? Did they

18:03.288 --> 18:05.350
ever march on the president's house? No. The only 
time they ever did anything, there were a couple of

18:06.211 --> 18:11.435
times.

18:15.278 --> 18:19.082
Well, you've got another problem, too.

18:20.503 --> 18:25.687
In World War I, you could go to A&M for $1. You knew 
that, didn't you? I'd heard that. You could. They

18:31.072 --> 18:32.113
paid all the fees. but you had to give your you had to 
pay your I don't know if you had to give them the

18:33.190 --> 19:01.965
housing or not but you had to pay your bail and there 
were those two buildings that were in front of the

18:33.190 --> 19:01.965
main building there were two there and every one of 
those guys came back with a .45

18:33.190 --> 19:01.965
and on top of The dome is a hook like this. With a 
light. 1,500 watts. Prexy's moon. Yeah. So what

19:11.860 --> 19:26.596
they did, you could walk into that one on that side 
and just push the screen open like that, and you

19:11.860 --> 19:26.596
could take that old .45 and take a shot at it. And you 
could fire one shot. at that thing, and there was a

19:32.658 --> 19:39.186
hell of a lot of holes.

19:39.206 --> 19:42.230
But that, and then they marked it on the wall. You 
just put a mark like this, and they marked four of

19:43.431 --> 19:49.859
them, scratches off this one. I walked into many of 
those rooms up there. They knocked it out every

19:52.883 --> 19:56.347
other night. Oh, really? Oh, so they did, they were 
successful. The last time I saw that tried was in

20:00.788 --> 20:05.495
1935. A company that I saw, they marched up there. 
And a guy took a Springfield and tried to hit it.

20:19.274 --> 20:21.417
That's the last time I ever saw that. Because one 
day in Mr. Rudder's office, he mentioned that he

20:23.319 --> 20:29.428
had tried when he was a student here. And I believe 
he's class of 32. To knock it out? Yeah, and he said

20:34.193 --> 20:41.843
that that was a very risky thing to do, but you 
thought it was really good to shoot at it one time.

20:42.544 --> 20:45.988
Yeah, but you always shot it with a .45. They used 
the rifle in the last one. And another thing that

20:49.253 --> 20:55.281
happened was that they had a problem with the flag 
on the flagpole.

20:59.345 --> 21:02.488
So you see that flag on that flagpole? The original 
one, I think they changed the flag. It was pipe. It

21:12.197 --> 21:13.398
had big joints in it.

21:16.581 --> 21:18.303
And the one guy said he could climb it. See, they 
just cut the rope right below the leg hole. And so it

21:29.112 --> 21:32.355
went up. And so they, this must have been back quite 
a while, because they came to me, we used to have

21:32.375 --> 21:48.971
kite fights in Simpson Field. And everybody had a 
kite, some pretty good size. And some of the

21:54.816 --> 21:58.900
students knew it and then some of the people there 
They were trying to get that flag down. It was some,

22:02.873 --> 22:09.500
I don't know, it wasn't a U.S. flag or any kind of 
flag. It was somebody's riding on it. So they asked

22:13.463 --> 22:19.029
me if I could fly a kite up there. Or they would get me 
a kite. Or could I build a kite? So I built a couch for

22:23.353 --> 22:24.554
them. I built a kite and put a big old tail on the end 
of it. And they filled it for the hooks, fishhooks.

22:40.866 --> 22:41.788
They got it. Really? That's the way they got it. And 
this was about when? Were you a student then? No, I

22:46.274 --> 22:48.717
was a student. Oh. That was when I was in high 
school. You were still in high school. Or in grade

22:52.683 --> 22:55.487
school, I think. But we used to have pretty good 
guidance like that. And Fermier, a kid named

23:00.980 --> 23:08.090
Fermier, his father and mother died here. And he 
was left here all by himself. That was a terrible

23:14.679 --> 23:18.264
story. His father went, Fermier was his name. His 
father, his wife died. And so the only way you could

23:31.253 --> 23:58.712
uh send a telegram was to go down to this uh where 
there was railroad across there was a tower and

23:31.253 --> 23:58.712
they kept people up there and that was connected to 
the western union that's the only place you could

23:31.253 --> 23:58.712
see him and so uh he uh He went there and

24:00.785 --> 24:14.176
got all the writing done for them to send out, and 
then he just slumped over. My, my, my. That is

24:18.340 --> 24:18.960
awful. He was a faculty member? He was head of the ME 
department. Oh, my. His name was Fermier. I've

24:26.567 --> 24:27.327
heard that name. That happens. So you know, you 
know. While you were a student, do you remember any

24:32.801 --> 24:40.032
tragic events involving other students? Oh, they 
used to have some problems with, I know one student

24:42.436 --> 24:58.399
got killed trying

24:42.436 --> 24:58.399
to, but he was killed right up there by the entrance 
of the college. they were hauling logs or

24:58.970 --> 25:04.458
something, or something like that. He got killed 
right there. That was with the

25:07.983 --> 25:17.698
bonfire. But none of the, and during your years, 
none of the presidents died of heart attacks or

25:17.718 --> 25:24.808
anything like that?

25:27.708 --> 25:29.690
No close family friend? No, no close family 
friend. What about happy times? What about some

25:33.034 --> 25:38.661
happy memories from your student days?

25:42.386 --> 25:54.981
Well, you didn't have any

25:42.386 --> 25:54.981
radio, no TV, so you went and played. Dean Bones' 
office in front of his yard, there'd be five or ten

25:55.467 --> 26:04.177
of us out there playing with each other. It might 
have been some sort of ball or something like that,

26:04.218 --> 26:13.008
but it was not really organized. When, as far as you 
remember, when did your family get a telephone at

26:13.028 --> 26:17.353
home?

26:20.817 --> 26:22.960
In College Park? Did you all have one on the campus 
in your home? Yes. Oh, you did? Okay. So you had a

26:32.171 --> 26:33.352
telephone early? We had a telephone early, yeah. 
Okay. The number was 125. 125. And was it a private

26:40.803 --> 26:44.869
line or a party line? Party line. Okay. All you had 
to do was just call up there, 125, please. And you

26:51.639 --> 26:53.402
did it. Now, on the college, when we moved off after 
World War II, it took a long time to get a phone. Oh,

27:01.264 --> 27:02.626
sure, sure. We had to tell that

27:04.908 --> 27:12.837
repairman that there was a bunch of money under 
that.

27:21.847 --> 27:23.389
Let's go back to hitchhiking. Share some of your 
hitchhiking stories. Some of your happiest and

27:27.335 --> 27:30.580
least happy. The only time I ever did hitchhiking 
really was coming back from Brookings. That was

27:37.349 --> 27:39.052
interesting. It was really interesting. So you 
wore your Aggie uniform all the way back from the

27:40.834 --> 27:44.259
Dakotas. Yeah. But you didn't hitchhike going 
from here to Houston? No, we had cars. Okay. Okay.

27:51.517 --> 27:54.161
Well, our family always had cars. We had the old 
Huffmobile. We had a 21 Dodge. Then we changed to

28:02.753 --> 28:07.580
the

28:02.753 --> 28:07.580
Model A. We had four of those. And then we had the 
first 1932

28:11.105 --> 28:18.695
Ford that ever came into town. Ned got it. And then 
we went 33s, 34s. And

28:26.427 --> 28:34.054
when I, in 35, I bought a 35. We had a 35 Oldsmobile.

28:39.579 --> 28:50.548
We had, and

28:39.579 --> 28:50.548
then we started on the, and then we got a 30, six 
automobile coupe. What was your favorite of all

28:56.851 --> 28:58.834
those cars? Oh, a Ford man. I don't care what it is. 
The what? A Ford man. A Ford man? That's a Ford man.

29:08.911 --> 29:15.962
The others, all of those mobiles up to the more 
modern ones, I had at the 41 and the remains of it are

29:16.685 --> 29:23.072
still sitting on the farm out there. I always have 
wished I had a about a 31 four-door Model A so I could

29:24.133 --> 29:33.503
carry four adults in it. I've always thought that 
would be great but I don't have the skill to repair

29:34.584 --> 29:41.612
it and I don't know who today I can fix it. But who 
else could? There aren't any of these young

29:44.974 --> 29:47.518
mechanics who wouldn't know how to do that. Well, 
if you get a good one and you get it cleaned up and

29:48.840 --> 29:58.013
it's right, you ain't got no problem for a long 
time. It'd be good. Now, during the Depression,

30:02.840 --> 30:09.810
though, a bunch of Aggies, a lot of Aggie students 
must have been very short on money. And so they had

30:11.967 --> 30:14.190
jobs on the campus. What else did they do to try to 
economize? Mostly they worked with the college.

30:23.240 --> 30:24.482
You see, they had student labor. And the college 
had an awful lot of funds for student labor.

30:37.597 --> 30:41.502
When some of the Aggies had out-of-town dates, Did 
any of them ever stay at your home? I've heard that

30:43.779 --> 30:48.123
some of the campus families. They would arrange 
with their date to stay with somebody else. That's

30:55.771 --> 30:57.433
correct. It was a family affair. The whole college 
was a family affair. Elaborate on that. Well, if

31:05.161 --> 31:08.805
the head of the department He had an obligation to 
go see,

31:09.376 --> 31:26.496
well, first off, the first thing Dad did when he got 
here, he got H.P. Smith somehow. He got F.R. Jones

31:30.520 --> 31:31.481
somehow. You probably know F.R. And then he got

31:34.125 --> 31:38.910
Pete Mumford. He got another fellow by the name of,
