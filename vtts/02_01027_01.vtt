WEBVTT

00:04.672 --> 00:13.984
First of all, I need to ask, because what this is 
going to do is it's going to go into the archives,

00:04.672 --> 00:13.984
kind of collection of interviews we have at A&M, so 
is it okay if you wind up here? No. Okay. First, can

00:16.987 --> 00:22.274
you give your rank, name rank, where you were 
stationed, that kind of thing? Okay. My name is

00:23.736 --> 00:25.258
Kirby B. Terry. I was a major in the Medical Corps. I 
entered Vietnam and was assigned to Americal

00:28.402 --> 00:33.328
Division. Um, and I was a clearing company 
commander for about six months. And following

00:40.160 --> 00:59.164
that, I spent six months in two other hospitals, 
one in, uh, An K, North, uh, Central Highlands,

00:40.160 --> 00:59.164
and, uh, spent three months in, uh, Quignon,

00:40.160 --> 00:59.164
uh, which is on the coast about midway down 
Vietnam. What do you, um, What years were you

01:01.220 --> 01:02.121
there? When did you... I was there from October 68 
to October 69. So that's right after you were

01:07.067 --> 01:10.490
there, right after the Tet Offensive. Yeah, the 
Tet Offensive was in January 68. I arrived in

01:13.894 --> 01:15.536
October 68. We also had a Tet Offensive in 1969, but 
it was much smaller. Where were you stationed in

01:20.241 --> 01:25.687
the United States when you were doing your 
training there? Well, I entered the Army in... El

01:28.034 --> 01:32.520
Paso, Texas at William Beaumont Army Hospital in 
1966.

01:33.782 --> 01:41.613
As a first lieutenant, and received my commission 
and became a captain in the Army Medical Corps. I

01:42.555 --> 01:45.279
was assigned to William Beaumont Army Hospital 
for a year. I did my internship at William Beaumont

01:46.320 --> 01:48.904
Army Hospital. From there, I then went to Tripler 
Army Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii. And spent a

01:55.293 --> 01:56.134
year and general surgery there. Following this I 
spent three months at the Army Field Service

01:59.642 --> 02:18.403
School in San Antonio, Texas, where I received all 
my basic orientation and pre-Vietnam training

01:59.642 --> 02:18.403
skills. Then from there I went directly to

02:24.835 --> 02:28.300
Saigon, that's where I entered the country. After 
spending a couple days of orientation there, I

02:29.521 --> 02:40.557
then flew to Chulalongkorn, which was up near Da 
Nang in the north part of South Vietnam. You

02:40.577 --> 02:43.561
mentioned that you were given some training 
before going over there. Could you talk a little

02:43.581 --> 02:48.868
bit about what kind of training you got a few months 
before you went to Vietnam?

02:50.688 --> 02:52.871
We didn't really receive any combat training. We 
received what we would consider, I think,

02:52.891 --> 02:55.995
defensive training. We spent most of the month 
learning how to salute, how to recognize people of

02:56.676 --> 03:05.227
various ranks.

03:08.211 --> 03:17.663
We went through the basic courses at Fort Sam 
Houston on weaponry and how to use a gas mask. We

03:17.723 --> 03:19.345
learned how to read compass. Took some hikes. We 
did a lot of marching and drilling, but we didn't do

03:21.903 --> 03:28.791
any real... We weren't learning to be combat 
soldiers at all. Did you get any cultural or

03:30.253 --> 03:36.460
training about how the people were going to react 
to you or language training, things like that? We

03:36.480 --> 03:49.416
didn't get any language training, but we spent a 
good bit of time in the orientation classes trying

03:36.480 --> 03:49.416
to be taught how the people were going to react to us 
and how we should try to react to them. Do you think

03:50.392 --> 03:51.995
any of this was effective at all? Helpful? Oh, I 
think it was quite effective. Much more effective

03:54.639 --> 04:04.836
than if we'd had none, because most of us had very 
little understanding of how the Oriental people

03:54.639 --> 04:04.836
act and react. Was it at all accurate? Were they 
pretty close to what was going on? I think so. Yeah,

04:10.084 --> 04:10.425
I think so. Then you also mentioned your 
orientation once you got to Saigon in July. Could

04:15.166 --> 04:16.768
you talk a little bit about what that was? Well, 
basically, when you get there, you hear cannons

04:17.069 --> 04:28.247
and stuff going off all the time, and people 
basically just try to orient you so that you can

04:17.069 --> 04:28.247
learn to tell incoming rounds from outgoing 
rounds. So that for outgoing, then you obviously

04:28.808 --> 04:34.236
don't have to be concerned about them. For 
incoming, you better get under the bed or get in the

04:34.377 --> 04:37.822
nearest hole. All right. They also passed out and 
assigned you weapons, that sort of thing, so that

04:38.890 --> 04:46.500
you had some protection. For instance, I was 
assigned a .45 pistol and an M16 rifle and the usual

04:47.001 --> 05:03.683
flak jacket, helmet, so that I would have some 
protection because I was basically just in a

04:47.001 --> 05:03.683
staging area and nobody was watching out for us. 
And then I was waiting until the flight was

05:07.679 --> 05:09.562
assigned to me to go to July. But if I had gotten lost 
or misplaced somewhere in between there, no one

05:10.843 --> 05:17.092
would have probably known exactly where I was or 
who I was. Was that right? Without my dog tags, you

05:18.193 --> 05:21.057
know, that sort of thing. Did you experience a lot 
of, you know, being mortared in artillery fire,

05:21.618 --> 05:30.110
things like that, just at the bases and areas you 
were in, or was that pretty uncommon? No. At the

05:31.692 --> 05:34.075
time I arrived, that was pretty uncommon. almost 
anywhere in Vietnam you were though, you would

05:34.561 --> 05:38.849
hear outgoing rounds all the time. And that was 
basically from our hires. And I always thought it

05:42.255 --> 05:49.187
was just a program they had to kind of keep 
everybody alerts and knowing that something was

05:42.255 --> 05:49.187
going on. I think they just basically peppered the 
hillsides with with artillery shells all the

05:49.227 --> 05:56.921
time. Was that mostly to keep just to keep us aware 
that the war was on, or was it an effective thing

05:59.401 --> 06:05.329
against the Vietnamese that they see? Well, I 
think it's kind of both, actually. Because when

06:08.413 --> 06:13.279
you sit around eight hours a day with nothing at all 
going on, people start to get lackadaisical. And

06:13.319 --> 06:21.610
if something's happening, it keeps you aware that 
the war's still going on, because when you get

06:13.319 --> 06:21.610
lackadaisical, that's when things usually 
happen and people get hurt. It was also important,

06:22.732 --> 06:26.016
I think, to let Charlie know that we knew where he 
was, And no matter where he was, when something was

06:26.519 --> 06:32.247
sighted from the air, somebody would shoot at it. 
You mentioned that you were a clearing company

06:34.089 --> 06:36.332
commander. Could you explain what that was and 
what your command was? Yeah. A clearing company in

06:42.701 --> 06:55.058
an infantry division is basically a group of about 
107 to 122 men who... whose assignment, like in

06:55.443 --> 07:09.037
World War II, was to stay behind the lines and clear 
people who had minor wounds, take care of them,

06:55.443 --> 07:09.037
keep them around a few days, and then send them back 
to combat. If they were severely wounded, they

07:09.957 --> 07:13.921
would be sent on to a major hospital for more care. 
In Vietnam, the clearing company was kind of an

07:15.363 --> 07:24.572
obsolete setup, except that we took care mostly of 
minor injuries and mostly skin problems, because

07:25.210 --> 07:30.895
everybody had severe acne. If they had acne, their 
acne acted up. If they had, I mean they continually

07:34.298 --> 07:48.049
had problems with fungus infections in their feet 
and groin and hair and all those sort of things

07:34.298 --> 07:48.049
simply because they weren't dry most of the time. 
So we took care mostly of minor medical injuries

07:49.410 --> 07:55.015
and minor surgical injuries. The more major 
injuries at this time went directly over us to a

07:55.585 --> 08:02.852
hospital, which was two or three miles away. And 
the hospital's where I went to later on after I

08:03.713 --> 08:09.798
served in this clearing company for six months. 
What were some of the types of people who were under

08:11.580 --> 08:14.303
your command? Most of the guys that were under my 
command were what I would consider like nursing

08:14.403 --> 08:22.410
type people. They were trained combat medics. and 
orderlies and a large number of them would go out

08:25.640 --> 08:54.702
with infantry units during the day for like two or 
three months at a stretch and then come back and

08:25.640 --> 08:54.702
work in this little clearing company for a while 
until they rested up and then they'd go back out

08:25.640 --> 08:54.702
with an infantry unit they were mostly people who 
would be like a licensed practical nurse and this

08:25.640 --> 08:54.702
sort of thing and we did have those 60 to 90 bed 
capability in our little hospital all the time

08:25.640 --> 08:54.702
there Most of these guys were pretty educated. 
Most of them had, all of them had high school

08:56.942 --> 09:00.727
educations. Many of them had college educations 
and degrees. And I expect most of them went into

09:04.291 --> 09:09.918
medicine or nursing or something of that nature 
later on. Because they were mostly very highly

09:10.018 --> 09:14.925
interested in medical problems. How risky of a job 
was that being a medic with an infantry corps?

09:19.230 --> 09:23.355
Being a medic with an infantry corps was very 
risky. A lot of guys would want to go do it, and then

09:23.639 --> 09:29.966
they'd do it a while, and then they'd try to get out 
of it if they could because it was a very dangerous

09:23.639 --> 09:29.966
job. I would rate it as the second most dangerous 
job in Vietnam, really. Who was the first? I'd say

09:35.211 --> 09:51.209
helicopter piloting was the first because any 
time somebody got wounded, the helicopter pilot

09:35.211 --> 09:51.209
came in to rescue them, and the enemy could see the 
helicopter very easily if they shot the man, and

09:35.211 --> 09:51.209
they could probably shoot a helicopter, which was 
a lot bigger, and it was in the same vicinity.

09:53.091 --> 09:53.511
The... Medic, however, had to go treat the person 
who had just gotten shot as soon as he could get

09:54.402 --> 09:59.568
there. And if one man got shot, it was very 
difficult to get to him without getting shot

10:00.309 --> 10:06.738
yourself. And the Vietnamese didn't hold back at 
all in shooting medics as far as I could tell. I

10:13.967 --> 10:17.351
mean, getting one man just meant the medic was 
going to be there in a little bit. If you waited

10:17.371 --> 10:19.173
around, you could shoot him too. And I think that's 
what happened lots of times. It was a very

10:21.773 --> 10:34.456
dangerous job, plus the fact that once you got 
there and did what you could do for him, you were the

10:21.773 --> 10:34.456
guy closest to him, and you had to try to drag him out 
to a safety spot, and that was very dangerous also.

10:36.219 --> 10:38.984
Were there, were there ever any racial problems 
you ever came across? We talked a little bit about

10:39.005 --> 10:40.447
this in class. We had a black historian come in to 
speak to us. Did you ever run across anything like

10:42.972 --> 10:45.857
that while you were there? fairly minor racial 
problems. The clearing company that I was

10:49.621 --> 10:55.447
commander of had about probably 15% blacks 
assigned to it. And we generally didn't have very

10:56.167 --> 11:11.963
much problem at all, except that if they didn't see 
that they were getting an equal shake about

10:56.167 --> 11:11.963
everything, they would complain about it more so 
than the average white person would, I thought.

11:12.684 --> 11:15.507
But in general, I think they did a very good job. 
They were very good soldiers, and they were very

11:16.128 --> 11:25.520
patriotic, and I was very pleased to have served 
with them. And at the time you were in Vietnam, what

11:25.540 --> 11:29.866
do you feel was the goal of the U.S. military? What 
did you see as what we were trying to accomplish at

11:29.946 --> 11:40.279
that point in time, right after Tet and until you 
left?

11:41.373 --> 11:56.186
As an officer in the Medical Corps, I don't know 
that I really knew what the goal there was or what it

11:41.373 --> 11:56.186
was clearly stated to be because I didn't see 
anything that really looked like we were going

11:41.373 --> 11:56.186
towards a goal. We were basically, at the time I was 
there, trying to win the hearts and minds of the

11:57.607 --> 12:10.519
people in order to get Vietnam back on its feet so 
that the South Vietnamese could take care of

11:57.607 --> 12:10.519
themselves against the North. I thought it was 
poorly run most of the time and it seemed like it was

12:11.191 --> 12:20.563
a very disjointed effort.

12:23.386 --> 12:40.388
It was obvious to me at least I thought we could have 
won the war very quickly had we wanted to and it

12:23.386 --> 12:40.388
seemed illogical to me to waste all those years and 
all those lives basically accomplishing nothing

12:23.386 --> 12:40.388
and after we were there For about 13 years, we 
really didn't accomplish anything that I could

12:40.739 --> 12:43.964
tell. So I really don't think there was ever a 
stated goal other than we were to win the hearts and

12:45.366 --> 12:53.357
minds of the people, get them strong enough to take 
care of themselves. We weren't there, I don't

12:53.838 --> 12:58.244
think, to win over the North Vietnamese 
communists. We were there to help the South

12:58.264 --> 13:04.312
Vietnamese get strong enough to take care of 
themselves. And that's the nearest thing I can

13:04.353 --> 13:10.341
figure to a goal after... almost 20 years now. What 
do you think would have been a way to have won the war

13:12.754 --> 13:17.021
initially? You said we could have spent a long time 
there and wasted a lot of lives. What do you feel we

13:19.605 --> 13:21.068
could have done? Well, I think we should have 
attacked the north right away if we were going to

13:21.488 --> 13:37.594
and bombed their munitions plants, areas where

13:21.488 --> 13:37.594
all their guns and their weapons were coming from. 
and just had a concerted effort to wiped out all of

13:37.743 --> 13:44.974
their supplies. I suppose our our superiors were 
afraid that if we did that Chinese would come in to

13:46.096 --> 13:51.625
help them. However, it didn't appear that we were 
accomplishing anything the way we were doing it

13:51.645 --> 14:05.286
because one or two North Vietnamese communist 
could keep an entire division of 10 to 20,000 men

14:05.857 --> 14:28.911
upset most of the time just by firing an occasional 
rocket into the large division compound and this

14:05.857 --> 14:28.911
would usually upset things for two to three hours 
so if one guy could do that three or four times a day

14:05.857 --> 14:28.911
he could keep that division from doing anything 
really worthwhile and we frequently saw that uh

14:05.857 --> 14:28.911
now then You mentioned that we were trying to win 
the hearts and minds. What types of things were you

14:32.757 --> 14:37.812
doing with the Vietnamese people in the area, 
things like that? Well, we tried in almost every

14:37.832 --> 14:44.571
way we could to make them feel that they were doing a 
good job. I myself and the medical company that I

14:45.074 --> 15:04.348
was commanding, we had what was called MedCap 
missions, M-E-D-C-A-P. And basically these were

14:45.074 --> 15:04.348
medical missions in which once a week in the 
afternoon we would go out to a village and give

14:45.074 --> 15:04.348
medical care. Basically, what we did was treat 
people with acute illnesses, chronic illnesses.

15:10.307 --> 15:12.590
We'd give them inoculations with pulled teeth. We 
basically did things to try to make them trust us.

15:17.255 --> 15:27.445
And that was probably our biggest mission because 
if the people were really sick or really were

15:17.255 --> 15:27.445
injured, they were brought into our hospitals 
almost immediately. The people themselves, the

15:27.845 --> 15:30.889
villagers would bring them in? Mm-hmm. And they 
would be admitted. If they could prove that they

15:32.695 --> 15:37.462
weren't a communist, they would be admitted and 
taken directly to a hospital. We treated many,

15:37.482 --> 15:41.307
many civilians very frequently. Do you think that 
they appreciated us being there, or were they

15:41.327 --> 15:45.272
mostly just, we were just another... I can't 
really answer that. Most of the people that I work

15:49.178 --> 15:57.269
with seem to appreciate us at a superficial level 
because we gave them jobs, we gave them money, we

15:49.178 --> 15:57.269
gave them food. But as far as ever gaining their 
confidence, I'm not sure we ever did that. in the

16:02.682 --> 16:04.924
time period that I was there at least. We'd been 
there for about 10 years before I got there. So I

16:10.410 --> 16:15.856
don't think we really ever accomplished that 
goal. Was communication a very big problem with

16:15.896 --> 16:19.260
the people? Were interpreters pretty much 
available for you to use? Yeah, we always had

16:22.824 --> 16:26.428
interpreters. available and communications 
were just no problem at all. Communications in the

16:33.209 --> 16:42.239
country was also excellent because there were 
very good radio and telephone contacts

16:33.209 --> 16:42.239
everywhere. And you could usually reach help 
somewhere no matter where you're at.

16:49.507 --> 16:55.453
But as far as working with people and 
understanding their immediate problems, that

16:49.507 --> 16:55.453
was never much of a problem for as I could tell. 
because the interpretation was very good.

17:01.209 --> 17:06.855
Were there many non-military groups that were 
doing similar things, like the Red Cross,

17:01.209 --> 17:06.855
Catholic Church, those type? Were you involved 
with anything? Well, the ones that I mainly saw

17:07.696 --> 17:10.079
were the Red Cross. There were also a good number of 
civilians there doing things for our government,

17:10.179 --> 17:24.597
and I don't know exactly who paid them, but they 
were there building roads and building bridges

17:10.179 --> 17:24.597
and building new buildings for us, and they 
basically were just Caucasians from almost

17:25.268 --> 17:29.112
anywhere who were just paid as civilians to work 
there. They were non-military people. They

17:31.054 --> 17:32.215
didn't fight or do anything. They were just 
helping build. The other groups that I saw were

17:34.897 --> 17:40.143
there were a good number of Australians there. 
There were a good number of people from New Zealand

17:40.183 --> 17:44.587
who were working as advisors. I don't know that 
they were actually fighting. There was they did a

17:48.451 --> 17:52.094
good bit of medical missionary also. There were a 
lot of Koreans soldiers there, the Iraqs. And they

17:57.806 --> 18:03.533
were very good soldiers and I think their stated 
goal was to help the Vietnamese in any way they

17:57.806 --> 18:03.533
could win the war. And they were some of the finest 
soldiers I ever saw. Did you ever notice any racial

18:07.098 --> 18:11.865
tensions between the Vietnamese and the Koreans? 
I don't think I did because I was never around where

18:11.885 --> 18:16.451
they lived. I just saw them here and there and took 
care of them when they were sick. But the Koreans, I

18:23.622 --> 18:31.569
thought, were

18:23.622 --> 18:31.569
very good soldiers. They were very well trained. 
They were slightly arrogant, and I think they kind

18:33.812 --> 18:38.016
of looked down upon the Vietnamese. And in 
general, rather than working closely with the

18:38.716 --> 18:50.187
Vietnamese, it seemed to me that they were 
assigned to their own units, like the ROC unit

18:38.716 --> 18:50.187
would go out and do everything all by itself, and 
they didn't... particularly mess around with the

18:50.572 --> 18:52.294
Vietnamese at all. They did things the way they 
wanted to when they went out to accomplish a

18:52.314 --> 18:55.498
mission. Yeah, that's basically the way we've 
talked about it, and it's been just like that.

18:58.681 --> 19:05.670
They've been separated, because historically, 
that's a lot of thousands of years that they've

18:58.681 --> 19:05.670
been racially different from each other. Now, as a 
commander, you know, were you ever involved with,

19:06.551 --> 19:13.879
you know, problems with getting supplies and 
things like that, and having to really work with

19:14.332 --> 19:17.655
the Vietnamese to get that or the bureaucracy? 
Well, we had to work with the bureaucracy a good bit

19:17.695 --> 19:21.918
to get what we needed.

19:25.081 --> 19:26.843
The Vietnamese had almost nothing. We had the best 
of everything in the way of medical supplies. We

19:30.546 --> 19:33.729
were probably better equipped than the average 
hospital in the United States. And the rumor was

19:34.589 --> 19:43.697
that if you were injured in Vietnam, you were 
probably better off than if you had been injured in

19:34.589 --> 19:43.697
front of a hospital in the United States because 
within 7 to 10 minutes after an injury occurred,

19:44.993 --> 19:53.843
there was usually a helicopter there to take care 
of that wounded person and bring him to the

19:44.993 --> 19:53.843
hospital. So they were actually getting medical 
care within 10 to 15 minutes most of the time. And in

19:58.668 --> 20:07.618
general, the infantry units were told, when you 
establish your very first contact, you should put

19:58.668 --> 20:07.618
in an order for a helicopter immediately. That 
way, if anybody gets hurt, the helicopter will be

20:07.678 --> 20:11.702
there in a few minutes. If nobody gets hurt, then 
you just cancel the order. And we commonly would

20:14.997 --> 20:21.126
see people who had been injured less than 30 
minutes by the time we saw them. That's pretty

20:21.146 --> 20:22.748
amazing. It really is. Now, you know, on the base, 
I'm sure there were a lot of times when you didn't

20:24.431 --> 20:29.879
have things to do and all that. What was sort of the 
life like? What went on on the base? Well, there was

20:33.384 --> 20:42.017
only about three or four things to do around the 
average division compound, and each company had

20:33.384 --> 20:42.017
its own division. mess hall and that sort of thing. 
We also had officers clubs that at each division

20:45.190 --> 20:54.221
level and there were probably several of them and 
the officers would usually go there in the evening

20:45.190 --> 20:54.221
if they had time. The non-commissioned officers 
had the same kind of club also and they would

20:54.882 --> 21:02.852
frequent it in the evenings. Most people, you 
know, wrote letters home, or dictated letters

21:07.192 --> 21:09.896
home. We all had little tape recorders. We could 
send the tapes back and forth.

21:16.286 --> 21:19.170
Many of us organized educational facilities. I 
started teaching some anatomy and physiology

21:19.190 --> 21:22.094
classes. And some of the orderlies and medics who 
were wanting to get further degrees would take the

21:22.816 --> 21:32.350
class that I taught in anatomy and physiology. And 
it was through the University of Maryland. They

21:34.393 --> 21:36.456
would actually get college credit for it. The

21:36.807 --> 21:57.290
worst thing about most wars is most people aren't 
very busy and they

21:36.807 --> 21:57.290
they're not occupied, except maybe for 14 hours a 
day that work at somewhere, eight hours a day, then

21:36.807 --> 21:57.290
they have two or three, four hours of whatever and 
then the rest of the time they had free. Our groups

21:58.191 --> 22:00.994
had a lot of physical activities. We had 
basketball goals and volleyball goals and We

22:04.482 --> 22:10.110
frequently played various kinds of ball games, 
pitched horseshoes, pitched washers. We also had

22:12.032 --> 22:17.379
television, which was available in most base 
camps. And television was about a week old by the

22:18.221 --> 22:20.984
time you saw it. It was shipped in. It's on 
videotape. So you would find out what happened a

22:24.008 --> 22:25.871
week later. But most of the shows you watch on 
television, it doesn't matter when they're

22:25.911 --> 22:30.157
recorded, actually. And it's kind of 
entertaining. So that's basically how most

22:33.558 --> 22:36.021
people spend their time. And we've, in some of the 
lectures we've had, we've had some guest speakers

22:37.643 --> 22:47.996
who've come in, and we had one recently who talked 
about, was talking about the films of the war, and

22:37.643 --> 22:47.996
he specifically mentioned MASH. You know, I had 
always assumed it was a war about Korea, but

22:48.016 --> 22:53.183
actually he said that it was a war about Vietnam 
placed in Korea. Would you draw that correlation

22:53.704 --> 22:58.069
in any way, this being his doctoral hospital? I 
don't know. I never thought of it that way before.

23:01.453 --> 23:02.755
I've never seen the... seen the correlation. I 
think after I haven't watched MASH many times in

23:07.170 --> 23:16.043
the last 20 years, probably only 15 or 20 times. And 
I think MASH was basically a movie about the

23:16.063 --> 23:25.636
medical core in any war though, and it doesn't 
particularly matter which one it was. I think

23:26.177 --> 23:30.042
that's probably probably applies if it would 
apply as well as Vietnam or Korea as any place else.

23:33.314 --> 23:39.279
Because he had stressed that, you know, how the 
craziness of it all was, how, you know, the boredom

23:33.314 --> 23:39.279
and just the anxieties. That was all very accurate 
about Vietnam, I can say that. Plus, the

23:42.682 --> 23:50.910
helicopter changed the face of the war, I think, 
because people could be flown directly to a battle

23:42.682 --> 23:50.910
site rather than having to be jeeped up or walked 
up. If some action was really going on and you

23:51.790 --> 23:56.174
needed replacements, they would fly them in 
immediately. It also made medical care 100%

23:56.775 --> 24:00.298
different, too, simply because, you know, you get 
to the hospital very quickly when you're injured.

24:05.423 --> 24:09.528
In World War II, it might be a day or two before you 
got to a medical facility. That's an interesting

24:10.869 --> 24:12.712
correlation. I hadn't heard that before. Now, how 
was the protection of your base area? Were you, you

24:17.978 --> 24:24.266
know, it was a pretty secure area, or were you ever, 
did you ever seem like you were in danger at any

24:17.978 --> 24:24.266
point in time? No, I don't think, I never felt in 
danger. At one time, When I was in July, we lived

24:29.759 --> 24:41.012
about 100 yards from the fence, and all there was 
between our huts and the fence were our tents,

24:29.759 --> 24:41.012
actually, was a road and some blank land. And then 
out near the fence, there were guard posts all

24:41.052 --> 24:46.598
along the fence. They were occupied mostly at 
night by guard people. You never knew whether they

24:51.063 --> 24:53.286
were alert. If somebody had come through the 
fence, they could have gotten to our tents very

24:53.992 --> 25:02.985
quickly and caused all sorts of trouble. But I 
don't think most of us ever worried about that at

25:03.025 --> 25:07.431
all. It's just one of the things, when you're 
there, you just accept it after a while that if they

25:08.833 --> 25:17.104
get in and get to you, that's all there is to it. 
There's nothing you can do about it anyway, so you

25:17.124 --> 25:19.648
just don't worry about it. Okay. And what were some 
of the, your duties are on campus. What were some of

25:24.086 --> 25:27.089
the more pleasant and some of the more unpleasant 
things you had to do? Well, each morning as a

25:27.430 --> 25:42.425
company commander, somebody usually woke me up 
about 7 o'clock to sign the duty roster, and that

25:27.430 --> 25:42.425
had to be filled out for the day, finishing up the 24 
hours, and then I had to sign my signature that it

25:27.430 --> 25:42.425
was accurate. Usually after this, I got out and 
showered and shaved, and our shower was a

25:43.105 --> 25:52.635
fuel tank that had been emptied washed out and 
filled with cold water. And it had a faucet on the

25:55.535 --> 26:01.201
bottom of it so we would spend a very short time in 
that cold water in the morning waking up. And then

26:01.842 --> 26:13.875
get dressed and go to the mess hall and have usually 
a fairly traditional breakfast if you wanted it of

26:01.842 --> 26:13.875
eggs and meat, bacon, coffee, and some juice. Then 
we would usually make rounds in our little

26:13.895 --> 26:18.100
hospital for maybe an hour and then either go do 
some minor surgery or work on sick call, which we

26:19.447 --> 26:36.712
would basically be seeing people from the 
battalion level who needed further medical care,

26:19.447 --> 26:36.712
and they would be brought over to us in a helicopter 
by jeep. Our major things that we took care of all

26:38.154 --> 26:48.829
day were basically these major skin problems I 
told you about, where people just couldn't wear

26:38.154 --> 26:48.829
their boots, they couldn't walk, they couldn't 
carry their packs. We also saw a lot of malaria.

26:53.955 --> 26:57.439
There was also a lot of diarrhea and dysentery and 
nausea and vomiting. And these minor problems

26:58.280 --> 27:01.844
were what we had to take care of most of the time. It 
just took a few days for a guy to get calmed down and

27:01.864 --> 27:08.772
get his confidence back and get to eating so he 
could go back to his own unit. And we did basically

27:09.373 --> 27:14.458
take care of a lot of injuries in this particular 
location. They were mostly minor surgical and

27:14.478 --> 27:18.563
major medical problems. I wonder about, you 
mentioned some of the records keeping and things

27:19.471 --> 27:22.055
like that. Was it your belief that most of that was 
all pretty accurate and things like that, things

27:22.095 --> 27:36.514
that came through your command or... Oh, you're 
talking about body counts or... Well, yeah, that,

27:22.095 --> 27:36.514
but yeah, I'm sure you probably worked too, that 
was mostly with the, I'm sure you worked too

27:22.095 --> 27:36.514
involved. Yeah. But, you know, just the 
day-to-day things where they just, people would

27:36.655 --> 27:49.292
get lazy and just, oh, well, it's... No, I think the 
record keeping was done pretty accurately by most

27:36.655 --> 27:49.292
people because there was always at least two or 
three levels of people checking everything. For

27:49.829 --> 28:11.933
instance, in our clearing company, this daily 
record that had to be compiled and had to be signed

27:49.829 --> 28:11.933
each morning gave a summary of what happened there 
for 24 hours, how many sick people we saw, how many

27:49.829 --> 28:11.933
we treated, how many we released, how many teeth 
were pulled, how many x-rays were taken, how many

27:49.829 --> 28:11.933
shots were given. I think it was all quite 
accurate. From my level as a company commander,

28:14.356 --> 28:18.520
though, it then went to battalion. and somebody 
there looked it over and then went to division

28:18.955 --> 28:25.601
level and it was filed away somewhere then. Would 
you say all that record keeping that had to be done,

28:26.222 --> 28:33.028
everything detailed, was that really necessary 
or was it just like a waste of time? No, I think it was

28:33.068 --> 28:34.309
necessary. The problem is at the time when you're 
doing it, it seems kind of like a waste of time, but

28:35.970 --> 28:48.962
four years later the historical part of it I think 
will be very accurate because we kept good

28:35.970 --> 28:48.962
records. And I think it's essential to keep good 
records, particularly in today's world of

28:49.212 --> 28:56.860
liability. The accurate record keeping that we 
learned and did there, I think, is still what you

28:57.941 --> 29:09.794
need to do today, if not more so. Now, what were some 
of your other missions in the more remote areas

29:09.814 --> 29:18.223
that you would do other things than just be 
stationed at your hospital? Could you explain

29:18.457 --> 29:20.059
some of the other things you might have done? Well, 
other than going out in the villages on what we call

29:21.300 --> 29:40.262
MedCap missions,

29:21.300 --> 29:40.262
once a month

29:21.300 --> 29:40.262
we would maybe get to go to Da Nang, which is 50 miles 
away, and we'd have to ride an airplane, which took

29:41.120 --> 29:49.513
You know, you had to go out and sit around all day 
long to wait for the airplane, and you would drive

29:41.120 --> 29:49.513
denying, and you'd have to find somebody sort of to 
stay with when you got there. And we would usually

29:50.274 --> 29:58.446
do this on Friday, and then on Saturday morning 
there was what was called an I-Corps, number one

29:50.274 --> 29:58.446
corps, medical meeting. And it was basically just 
an attempt of physicians in the I-Corps, which was

29:59.227 --> 30:06.418
the northern third of Vietnam, to... keep up on 
things and at this meeting we would give reports on

30:06.922 --> 30:33.739
what we've been doing and what was happening and 
that we were here lectured many times on how to take

30:06.922 --> 30:33.739
care of various kinds of injuries or various kinds 
of medical problems there would usually be

30:06.922 --> 30:33.739
demonstrations sometimes of uh that demonstrate 
the kind of equipment that they've captured from

30:06.922 --> 30:33.739
the north vietnamese or from vietcong and i have 
pictures of many of the things that i saw that

30:06.922 --> 30:33.739
worked on display for us and we were really 
surprised and amazed how well they were equipped

30:34.023 --> 30:50.100
in their aid stations and in their little 
hospitals that were probably underground

30:34.023 --> 30:50.100
someplace because they had regular operating 
facilities I think in many areas for taking care of

30:34.023 --> 30:50.100
their wounded. And we've read about the ones that 
have just had fabulous networks of tunnels with

30:50.500 --> 30:56.786
all hospital facilities. I never saw any of those 
but I heard about them and I think they were

30:56.806 --> 31:00.250
probably there One of the other things that we 
would do, I would sometimes go out with the Red

31:00.955 --> 31:13.831
Cross people to contact soldiers for emergency 
messages back home. Usually if a soldier's family

31:14.712 --> 31:22.201
had a death in the family, they would try to hold up 
the funeral until the soldier could be gotten

31:14.712 --> 31:22.201
home. That was one of the biggest services, I 
think, of the Red Cross was taking care of

31:23.282 --> 31:29.950
emergency situations for a soldier and his 
family. And that was very well taken care of, I

31:30.352 --> 31:33.237
think, in most cases. And the average soldier 
could be probably back in the United States in

31:34.799 --> 31:45.938
about three to four days from the time he received 
word of a death in the family.

31:46.900 --> 31:53.170
Were you ever stationed in an area where you were 
having to treat a lot of serious injuries, people

31:46.900 --> 31:53.170
coming in? Yes, I was. After the first six months in 
July, I then went to a hospital facility where I got

31:54.116 --> 32:02.030
to spend six more months. And three months of that 
was in on K. I think it's spelled a n capital k h e.

32:02.591 --> 32:15.372
That was in the Central Highlands and I was with the 
17th field hospital there. I was basically

32:16.474 --> 32:19.579
assigned as a assistant surgeon. which meant that 
I couldn't initiate most surgery by myself, but I

32:19.897 --> 32:28.025
helped other surgeons who were fully trained, 
since I'd only had two years of surgery at the time.

32:29.387 --> 32:38.176
It was an extremely good experience for me because 
I worked with two fully trained people all the

32:29.387 --> 32:38.176
time, and it was basically like a residency 
training program. These two guys had just

32:38.196 --> 32:45.203
finished their residency, and they were very 
interested in teaching me anything they could,

32:38.196 --> 32:45.203
and I was very interested in learning. So 
basically, I helped them with everything that

32:47.352 --> 32:52.899
they did, and they let me do as much as I could do. In 
many cases, when we would be covered up with

32:53.700 --> 33:16.330
injuries, and they were very severe injuries in 
this particular area, lots of gunshot wounds,

32:53.700 --> 33:16.330
landmine wounds, pungi stick wounds, I would be 
starting a case, opening up the abdomen of the

32:53.700 --> 33:16.330
injured person or whatever was required, one of 
the fully trained people would then come over and

33:16.715 --> 33:29.187
help me take care of the major problem or take care 
of it himself, then I would be allowed to go ahead

33:16.715 --> 33:29.187
and close that person's abdomen, which is what 
happens in most residency programs. The

33:29.647 --> 33:37.475
beginning surgeon gets to do the easier parts, 
such as opening and closing, and then the fully

33:29.647 --> 33:37.475
trained person does the major operation itself. 
And that's basically the role I had there. What

33:41.619 --> 33:45.102
were the conditions of most of the men you saw as 
coming in there yet? were they mostly gunshot

33:45.757 --> 33:50.543
wounds, landmines, things like that? How long had 
they been around and things like that? Well, most

33:52.766 --> 34:00.034
of the people we saw were very freshly injured, 
such as almost always within an hour. And they were

34:00.916 --> 34:10.567
gunshot wounds, fragment wounds from mines, 
grenades, mortars, rocket attacks, and pungi

34:00.916 --> 34:10.567
stick wounds. Pungi stick wounds were fairly 
frequent because people, as they walked through

34:11.068 --> 34:15.173
the jungle, would run on these fungi sticks which 
were a very sharp angled bamboo stake. They

34:20.902 --> 34:32.723
usually had feces smeared on them so they would 
cause an infection in the person's leg and they

34:20.902 --> 34:32.723
required a lot of surgical intervention simply 
because you would have to make an incision around

34:34.525 --> 34:42.296
the wound itself and excise a little bit of it, but 
you would also have to go inside and do what was

34:34.525 --> 34:42.296
called a fasciotomy. Open up the fascia around the 
muscles that that pungi stick had penetrated

34:42.817 --> 34:58.980
because the infection would make those muscles 
swell up and they would become gangrenous if you

34:42.817 --> 34:58.980
didn't allow them to swell because the pressure 
had to be relieved. It seemed like you were making a

35:00.091 --> 35:12.389
very serious operation out of a very small injury, 
but if you didn't do it that way, they many times

35:00.091 --> 35:12.389
wound up losing a large amount of muscle or even 
their limb.

35:16.476 --> 35:16.836
Let's see. Then did you also...

35:17.838 --> 35:21.984
Let me see. Oh, from the mines. What kind of 
injuries would be sustained from a landmine

35:23.146 --> 35:26.951
injury? Well, there were several kinds of mines. 
Claymore mines were some of the more common ones

35:30.820 --> 36:00.253
and Claymore mines were

35:30.820 --> 36:00.253
basically a kind of a broad shaped mine that had a 
lot of explosive behind the pellets which were

35:30.820 --> 36:00.253
then propelled forward when a mine went off and 
they would many times be designed to cover a large

35:30.820 --> 36:00.253
area above the ground and you could like cover a 
whole road or something like that with one of these

35:30.820 --> 36:00.253
mines. so that anything that was coming down the 
road would probably get hit by one of these mine

36:00.385 --> 36:05.011
fragments. We saw a lot of makeshift mines also 
that were made by various people, mostly

36:05.031 --> 36:17.247
Vietnamese, from bombs that hadn't exploded or 
from rockets or mortars that hadn't exploded. And

36:18.148 --> 36:28.502
they would hook them up to some sort of detonating 
device and blow up vehicles on the road, blow up

36:18.148 --> 36:28.502
people out in the jungle. They were very good at 
making mines out of what we thought were dead bombs

36:29.090 --> 36:35.342
and dead equipment.

36:43.137 --> 36:45.522
When you were treating these injuries, you didn't 
see a lot of serious injuries. Was it hard for you to

36:45.662 --> 36:49.449
treat them and know that you were just going to send 
them right back into combat? No, I don't think so. I

36:53.069 --> 36:55.251
don't think that really ever crossed your mind. 
It's just like when you're taking care of a sick

36:55.371 --> 36:59.456
civilian anywhere else in the world. Your job is to 
get him back to the workplace so he can do what his

36:59.936 --> 37:04.141
job in life is. And in a combat situation, it's very 
much the same. It wasn't the kind of situation

37:08.986 --> 37:14.252
where you had a real personal relationship with 
the people. If it had been one of your friends or

37:14.993 --> 37:18.076
relatives, it might have been different. But your 
job was to keep the fighting man healthy, and that

37:18.116 --> 37:22.941
was what we did. Did you ever treat any of the Arvin 
soldiers or even BC? Oh, yeah, we treated Arvin

37:26.891 --> 37:29.696
soldiers all the time. We commonly treated the 
Rock soldiers. We treated the

37:32.661 --> 37:39.934
Mountain Yard soldiers when we were in the Central 
Highlands. We treated anybody that was brought

37:41.296 --> 37:48.068
in, and that many times included BC soldiers and 
North Vietnamese soldiers. They had already had

37:48.706 --> 37:51.529
their weapons and everything taken away from 
them. They were injured. Many times these guys

37:53.251 --> 38:04.723
would be very sick because they might have been 
shot a day or two ahead of time and hidden

37:53.251 --> 38:04.723
somewhere, and they would come in all bloated up 
and very, very ill by the time we saw them. We

38:04.743 --> 38:13.212
frequently had to amputate limbs simply because 
they had very little primary medical care, and by

38:04.743 --> 38:13.212
the time we saw them, They were very sick and in 
severe condition, and they many times did require

38:13.698 --> 38:25.281
amputations just to get rid of a very infected part 
of their body. And what about the Arvin troops

38:26.503 --> 38:28.968
themselves as soldiers? How do you think they 
performed? Well, I was never very impressed with

38:32.034 --> 38:36.162
the Arvin soldiers in general.

38:38.892 --> 38:49.281
I think the average American soldier that I was 
around seemed to think of them as like Boy Scouts,

38:38.892 --> 38:49.281
like we were training junior soldiers to do a job. 
And they were basically kind of treated as though

38:50.042 --> 38:57.468
they weren't really capable of doing this 
themselves right now. They were sort of just

38:57.528 --> 39:02.332
supposed to stand around and watch how the 
Americans did it. And I thought they were probably

39:03.493 --> 39:07.617
treated as inferiors And most of them that I saw 
acted as though they were inferiors. Do you think

39:13.892 --> 39:17.057
had they been treated differently, they wouldn't 
behave differently? I don't know. I don't guess I

39:17.578 --> 39:28.696
can answer that because I never saw any of them for 
any long period of time to see how they developed

39:17.578 --> 39:28.696
after they became experienced. I always thought 
they basically took advantage of our situation.

39:34.705 --> 39:35.747
They let our men go out and do most of the fighting 
when they could, and they sort of stood around and

39:36.605 --> 39:45.199
watched or guarded the town while somebody else 
was out doing the fighting. I was not impressed

39:45.940 --> 39:49.305
with the urban soldiers at all. How about the 
Saigon government? Do you feel that the Saigon

39:51.168 --> 39:56.657
government was really worthy of our support and 
capable of controlling the country themselves?

39:57.618 --> 40:04.249
Well, looking at it 20 years later, I probably... 
don't think that they were worthy of it. And I'm not

40:09.033 --> 40:10.675
sure exactly why that is. But at the time I was 
there, I didn't have any idea what was going on

40:10.775 --> 40:16.922
militarily or politically. And I can't ever 
remember talking to anybody who basically

40:17.783 --> 40:24.610
strongly thought we should have been in Vietnam. 
Most people were just there because they were told

40:25.151 --> 40:28.555
to go and it was their assignment. I don't think we 
had any

40:33.457 --> 40:45.390
I don't think we had a lot of patriotic reason to be 
there as soldiers, and we didn't feel that we were

40:33.457 --> 40:45.390
there doing some great job for some nation that 
needed us dramatically. It was just a job for you.

40:47.393 --> 40:48.974
It was just an assignment, that was it. And from all 
the people I saw who were privates all the way up to

40:49.014 --> 40:59.346
generals, I really never talked to anybody who 
thought we probably should have been there. And we

40:59.647 --> 41:01.289
were doing a lot of good. I don't think that was the 
average person's viewpoint. Now, when you were in

41:07.615 --> 41:19.327
Vietnam, were you ever aware, before you went or 
while you were there, of the rising anti-war

41:07.615 --> 41:19.327
sentiments and protests and trouble back home 
that was brewing? No. When I was there in 1968, 69,

41:20.168 --> 41:28.236
that was the year the man landed on the moon first. 
It was the year

41:28.739 --> 41:36.188
Ted Kennedy drove off the bridge at 
Chappaquiddick. We heard a little bit about that.

41:38.911 --> 41:41.294
Those were the two big events. And I recall, I 
think, that they happened the same week so that

41:41.314 --> 41:58.155
Teddy's

41:41.314 --> 41:58.155
problem never got as nearly as much publicity as it 
would have had we not landed a man on the moon that

41:41.314 --> 41:58.155
same week. Well, we really never heard much about 
what was going on back home. Everything we read was

42:01.963 --> 42:05.587
in the daily newspaper that was printed by the 
Army. And so unless you got a paper from home, which

42:06.368 --> 42:12.155
might take a couple weeks to get there, you didn't 
know much at all. And I was not aware at all of the

42:12.835 --> 42:19.203
sentiment back home about the war. We would 
occasionally hear something about university

42:20.484 --> 42:27.552
students acting up or protesting, but I didn't 
know anything really about it. How about after you

42:28.088 --> 42:29.429
came back? Well, after I came back, I became very 
aware of that because I came back to Fort Eustis,

42:29.449 --> 42:52.054
Virginia, which was fairly close to Richmond, and 
I knew the students were acting up on those

42:29.449 --> 42:52.054
campuses at that time, and people were beginning 
to demand all over the United States that we pull

42:29.449 --> 42:52.054
out of Vietnam, and it seemed like probably the 
thing to do to me It seemed proper for us to pull out

42:53.536 --> 43:04.108
simply because we'd been there so long and had 
never really given a concerted effort to win the

42:53.536 --> 43:04.108
war, either for the Vietnamese or to make them win 
the war. And I thought if we weren't going to really

43:04.809 --> 43:13.999
give it 100%, then we should pull back and get out of 
it, which we did shortly after that. What about

43:14.019 --> 43:20.106
Nixon's handling then of the Vietnamization 
process, getting him out and trying to turn

43:14.019 --> 43:20.106
control of the Vietnamese? Do you think he did a 
good job or a fair job I don't know if I can answer

43:23.810 --> 43:30.697
that or not, because I didn't know that much about 
the political side of it. I was still in the Army at

43:30.717 --> 43:33.920
the time, and I was real busy as a surgeon.

43:36.923 --> 43:43.569
I thought he did what was proper, basically, in 
getting us out of there as quickly as he could once a

43:36.923 --> 43:43.569
decision was made. While I was in Vietnam, Lyndon 
Johnson was still president, and I was there

43:44.890 --> 43:52.838
during the time we had 500,000 men there. 
Obviously, if we had put out a big effort, 500,000

43:53.071 --> 44:05.123
of us could have probably done a lot more than we did 
because we really were there basically occupying

43:53.071 --> 44:05.123
the country. We weren't there fighting war, in my 
experience, in my opinion. One set of figures we

44:08.706 --> 44:18.136
come across pretty often in my class is that there 
were 500 or 540,000 people there, but of that

44:08.706 --> 44:18.136
number, only 80,000 were combat troops. That's 
probably right. There's just a lot of backup.

44:20.638 --> 44:21.559
Yeah, I think that's probably right. While I was 
there also, he started bombing the North. And I

44:26.023 --> 44:32.149
don't know that that really changed things very 
much, as far as we were concerned. I was also there

44:32.690 --> 44:35.293
during the year when Ho Chi Minh died. And that was 
kind of an interesting experience because I was in

44:35.313 --> 44:44.642
a hospital that was basically a prisoner of war 
hospital. We took care of mostly prisoners of war.

44:47.605 --> 44:50.128
And that was in Quy Nhon, a huge, Q-H-I.

44:57.198 --> 45:04.868
It's

44:57.198 --> 45:04.868
Y-H-O-N, I think, or something like that. This was 
basically a... We took care of a lot of our own

45:05.028 --> 45:10.896
troops, but we also... It was a prisoner of war 
hospital. Once the prison... We took care of

45:12.819 --> 45:21.330
prisoners immediately after they came in, and 
then we also kept them around for a while until they

45:12.819 --> 45:21.330
were assigned to go to a... Army unit to be in. It was 
like a prison camp, yeah. But a large number of

45:28.189 --> 45:34.279
those guys we had had amputations and that sort of 
thing, and they stayed around a pretty long period

45:28.189 --> 45:34.279
of time. And I got to know some of them, and I grew to 
like and trust most of the North Vietnamese that I

45:34.780 --> 45:42.231
took care of. I thought they were much more honest 
and probably Harder working and much better

45:48.040 --> 45:52.427
soldiers than the South Vietnamese that I was 
around. During the time that I was there when Ho Chi

45:53.208 --> 46:12.117
Minh died, it was very interesting because all the 
guys who, when they heard about his dying, wore a

45:53.208 --> 46:12.117
black sleeve patch made out of something. And we 
never...

46:17.099 --> 46:21.204
interfered in any way with their doing this 
because it was their way of mourning for their

46:17.099 --> 46:21.204
leader. And I think it was what any soldier would 
have done had his leader died. I only hope that our

46:28.213 --> 46:40.127
soldiers did the same thing for our president when 
he died during that same time frame. Did you notice

46:40.147 --> 46:44.853
any mourning with the southerners, the South 
Vietnamese? Did they feel a loss? I don't think the

46:46.546 --> 46:48.989
South Vietnamese felt lost at all. Most of them 
seemed to feel that... I don't... Most of the South

46:55.177 --> 47:10.417
Vietnamese that I was around were not highly 
educated people historically, and I don't think

46:55.177 --> 47:10.417
that they felt very much for Ho Chi Minh or that they 
really believed that he was trying to save Vietnam

46:55.177 --> 47:10.417
and such. And from what I've seen, it looks to me 
like he dedicated his whole life to saving Vietnam

47:16.330 --> 47:26.492
as a whole and when he couldn't get help one place 
and he went somewhere else to get the help.
