WEBVTT

00:01.499 --> 00:10.732
Okay,

00:01.499 --> 00:10.732
today is June 9th, 1981. This is our second 
interview with General Kidwell. And last time we

00:14.538 --> 00:22.008
finished, well, we just basically covered the end 
of the war. We talked about General Clark a little

00:22.068 --> 00:23.891
bit. We got to May 1945. And you were in Austria. And 
there are a couple of questions I want to ask. All

00:32.549 --> 00:33.069
right. When you were with the conference between 
the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, and

00:33.089 --> 00:45.885
France, attempting to exactly what were you 
attempting to do? I guess I should start. What were

00:47.066 --> 00:48.168
we attempting to do? Yeah, you said that you were 
trying to set up the utilities. You were the chief

00:50.370 --> 00:52.873
public works and utility officer. Right. Our job 
or our responsibility was to to reestablish

00:57.423 --> 01:03.009
electric energy in Austria. Austria is a country 
that lives with electric power, both

01:03.229 --> 01:16.463
hydroelectric and coal-fired steam generation. 
And

01:17.564 --> 01:24.291
none of the occupying forces or conquering forces 
knew what they had. They just knew to turn the

01:26.629 --> 01:30.194
lights on and switch on and nothing happened. And 
of course in combat, wires get shot down, power

01:31.276 --> 01:52.966
stations get bombed,

01:31.276 --> 01:52.966
railroad lines get bombed, and power lines 
inherently follow railroad lines because it's

01:31.276 --> 01:52.966
the most easily constructed area. And so The

01:55.523 --> 02:24.973
governing powers, meaning the quadripartite 
level of General Mark Clark for the American

01:55.523 --> 02:24.973
representative and an English general, a French 
general, and a Russian general, set about going to

01:55.523 --> 02:24.973
govern these occupied, and relatively speaking, 
Russia Each nation had about a fourth of it. Russia

02:28.084 --> 02:40.518
got the biggest fourth, but

02:28.084 --> 02:40.518
our job is, we were appointed, I was appointed as 
the public utility officer representing the

02:28.084 --> 02:40.518
American forces. It was a English brigadier, 
French brigadier, and a Russian major general

02:42.360 --> 02:50.408
that was masquerading as a major. Why, I don't 
know. That's how curious. Well, it was their

02:56.269 --> 02:59.653
method of subterfuge. He was an artilleryman, and 
that gave me the entree to breaking him down and

03:01.395 --> 03:07.442
knowing a whole lot about him. And he was a British 
soldier. What was his name? Correct Cole. Correct

03:13.969 --> 03:14.910
Cole. How do you spell that? I pronounce it 
K-R-E-C-K-O, but that may not be the

03:17.252 --> 03:22.298
pronunciation. I mean the spelling, but that's 
the way you pronounce it correctly.

03:30.800 --> 03:45.918
The American Army got the identification and 
intelligence on him through some of my endeavors,

03:30.800 --> 03:45.918
and that set him on the trail of proving out who he 
was and why he was masquerading as a major. I'll

03:46.058 --> 03:49.382
never know, but that is it. What kind of person was 
he? He was a very likable person. He always had his,

03:52.822 --> 03:58.109
I call it, his political commissar with him. He 
would never make a statement without huddling

03:58.490 --> 04:03.657
with his fellow. I forget his name, but he was a 
civilian. But he was a politician, or the

04:06.922 --> 04:13.390
communist representative versus the military 
representative. And they were inseparable. They

04:15.273 --> 04:19.639
went hand in glove, and both of them would yak at the 
interpreter. And an interpreter would, I guess,

04:20.362 --> 04:25.987
blend what they were saying and come in and tell me 
what it was or tell the group what it was. Why do you

04:27.969 --> 04:29.110
say he was likable? He was likable. He was 
pleasant. If it was a cat and mouse or a poker game

04:31.732 --> 04:37.937
with him, he never knew anything. And of course, I 
tried to inform myself on what I wanted to know

04:39.418 --> 04:45.303
before I ever got there. And he would lie to you just 
looking you right in the face. He caught hands down

04:49.775 --> 04:52.918
with his hand in the cookie jar, but he didn't swear 
at it. No, he was sitting over here reading the

04:52.938 --> 04:56.461
Bible or something. He was a funny fellow, but he 
was likable. I mean, he was pleasant to talk with.

05:01.725 --> 05:06.369
And as an artilleryman, we had a lot to talk about. 
Their philosophy on artillery is very different

05:06.489 --> 05:09.572
from ours. I explained yesterday where they fire 
area fire versus pinpoint fire that the American

05:12.234 --> 05:19.140
Army They don't have the capabilities. They 
didn't at that time, let's say it that way.

05:30.879 --> 05:35.884
Our job, we had a meeting and discussed what we were 
going to do and how we were going to do it. And most

05:35.984 --> 05:40.168
people all looked to the American Army to be the 
leader. Even the Russians? The Russians, the

05:41.890 --> 05:43.511
French, and the English. Purely and simply 
because they were over there as conquerors and to

05:44.132 --> 05:50.258
take whatever they could get. where the American 
army was over there to restore peace and to set the

05:51.335 --> 06:02.269
economy back up and get it working and then turn the 
government back to the Austrians. Of course, it

06:03.009 --> 06:11.119
had been controlled by the Nazis and the American 
approach was to turn it over back to the Austrians.

06:12.621 --> 06:17.207
So, we decided that before we could, tell our 
superiors anything about the the condition of the

06:18.689 --> 06:27.263
power plants and the power line and all we had 
inventory of them. Yeah. Weren't there any

06:28.244 --> 06:30.728
Austrians around to help? Any Austrians? Well 
this is the point I'm leading up to. The Russians

06:36.698 --> 06:42.587
and the American, I mean the English and the French 
look to the American Army to do this. Set the power

06:44.895 --> 06:53.814
plants up, get our soldiers in there, our 
technicians, and our equipment, and get the thing

06:44.895 --> 06:53.814
running so they could turn the light on and 
something would happen. Even in the Russian zone?

06:55.338 --> 06:56.460
In the Russian zone, yes.

07:00.509 --> 07:02.112
They wanted our help. They were only interested 
in, for instance, the Russians were interested in

07:02.800 --> 07:09.951
dismantling the plants and hauling them back to 
Russia. And I'll tell you a story about that later.

07:13.095 --> 07:14.918
I'll get into the details of the thing. The English 
were interested in setting Tito up down in

07:15.679 --> 07:21.087
Yugoslavia. And they wanted to take all the Jews' 
power, excess power that they had in their area,

07:21.107 --> 07:29.880
transmit it to Yugoslavia to set them up. Mm-hmm. 
And the French, they were just a bunch of leeches,

07:30.526 --> 07:42.562
meaning they were interested in pillaging and 
taking back to France, because the Germans had

07:30.526 --> 07:42.562
done them that way, and as far as they were 
concerned, the Austrians were Germans. Yeah. So,

07:43.543 --> 07:47.729
our first... What about the British? Well, the 
British were interested in hauling and taking,

07:47.749 --> 07:57.141
transmitting their power, excess power, or some 
of their power, and getting the excess from the

07:47.749 --> 07:57.141
American area, and piping it down to Yugoslavia to 
set Tito up. The British? The British, yes. I

08:02.346 --> 08:04.428
thought you said the Russians wanted to set Tito 
up. No, no, the British. The Russians want to haul

08:05.730 --> 08:08.693
the stuff back to Russia. Oh, okay, okay, okay. I 
was a little confused there. The British were

08:12.136 --> 08:16.561
interested in setting Tito up down in Yugoslavia 
for some reason or another. Mr. Churchill was very

08:16.861 --> 08:21.506
pro-Tito in Yugoslavia. He was trying to set that 
nation up and That was the directive and of course

08:26.450 --> 08:28.772
that's our approach to it. So the first thing we had 
to do was find out what power plants were in

08:31.275 --> 08:34.898
operation. And of course I was able to secure a list 
of the power plants in Vienna through captured

08:35.959 --> 08:54.077
documents and through normal relations with the 
power industry there, which was centralized in

08:35.959 --> 08:54.077
Vienna. So we took out and it fell on my shoulders to 
furnish the transportation and the food and all

08:54.884 --> 09:21.702
this kind of business because we were able to and I 
did it to get my job done rather than say, well, I'll

08:54.884 --> 09:21.702
take you in the American zone and then there's no 
telling what'll happen in the Russian zone or the

08:54.884 --> 09:21.702
French zone or the Miami zone, the English zone. So 
I furnished transportation and the fuel and the

09:22.846 --> 09:34.496
driver and we made a tour of all the power plants in 
all of Australia and inventorying them. I said the

09:36.678 --> 09:52.212
other three nations were interested in the 
Americans doing the restoration and I took the

09:36.678 --> 09:52.212
attitude that it wasn't an American job that we 
were certainly going to do in our sector, no

09:36.678 --> 09:52.212
question about that. if we had to, but the approach 
that I took was that we should get the Austrians who

09:52.985 --> 10:07.821
worked in that power plant, who were 
superintendents of that power plant, to do the

09:52.985 --> 10:07.821
restoration. He knew what power lines were down 
and what weren't. He knew which switch to pull to

10:11.585 --> 10:19.414
energize one south or one east or one west, and 
certainly we didn't. It would have taken us years

10:20.052 --> 10:27.442
to get in there and actually rebuild the thing as 
far as we were concerned. So I went to General

10:28.304 --> 10:45.307
Saltman, who was my superior, and told him what I'd 
realized and my approach to it, and of course he

10:28.304 --> 10:45.307
checked it out with General Clark as a directive, 
and that's what we decided to do. That we would...

10:48.048 --> 10:52.474
get the Austrians to restore their plant. Get the 
Austrians to restring the lines. And if need be, we

10:55.559 --> 10:57.582
could furnish the wire. Yeah, we could give them 
the supplies. We could give them the supplies if

10:59.464 --> 11:01.547
need be. But first, we were going to make them, with 
their own capabilities, do it. How did Austrians

11:09.952 --> 11:12.575
respond to this idea? Yes, they very much liked it 
because that meant to us we put them back on the

11:12.595 --> 11:20.925
payroll and got them to helping themselves. And 
that was our big job is to get them to helping

11:21.846 --> 11:27.993
themselves to restore their own industry. So we 
took a tour of all Austria and that was really a

11:28.694 --> 11:39.587
fantastic experience because it's the most 
gorgeous country in the world. and a lot of good

11:40.850 --> 11:42.693
Austrians. They were all eager to get about their 
chores when I laid it out to them with the

11:42.713 --> 11:53.633
concurrence of these other people and they got 
about doing it. You had no problems under the

11:55.096 --> 11:56.699
Austrians? No problems. They were very 
cooperative. Sometimes we had to furnish them

11:59.283 --> 12:01.828
with with diesel fuel to run their trucks, for 
instance. And that was a small price to pay.

12:08.222 --> 12:17.672
Sometimes we furnished them with some wire for a 
critical lap or loop or something around some bad

12:08.222 --> 12:17.672
areas or something like that. We'd furnish them 
wire, and then they'd furnish the poles and the

12:18.133 --> 12:22.418
manpower. It was the manpower that I was fighting 
because I didn't want to take as much American

12:22.438 --> 12:28.845
soldiers and rebuild a thing for them. As far as I 
was concerned, the American soldiers had done his

12:29.922 --> 12:48.764
job, and he was just over staying trained, and that 
was our big chore of keeping him

12:29.922 --> 12:48.764
at a high point of training so that if something 
erupted, well, we were capable of going back to

12:29.922 --> 12:48.764
combat. And you never knew. Were there fears that? 
Well, there might be a pocket of German resistance

12:51.792 --> 12:54.697
someplace. No, that was close. Or was Japan a 
worry? Well, of course, VJ Day had already passed.

13:01.028 --> 13:01.889
Right, OK. So frankly, the fear was of the 
Russians. No question about it, in my mind. Did you

13:10.456 --> 13:13.620
talk about this with your colleagues? I'm sorry? 
Did you talk about this? Not in this group. All we

13:19.728 --> 13:27.958
talked about was the weather and hunting and power 
transmission and generations. But certainly I

13:27.978 --> 13:35.507
got it through our G2 information on what our 
preparations were for. But we were trying to

13:35.968 --> 13:40.193
defensively think and yet Offensively, we go 
about our job of restoring power. And all the time

13:43.928 --> 13:48.072
in the back of your mind, you don't trust them. You 
don't trust any of them. I didn't trust any of them.

13:50.835 --> 13:51.255
Why is that? Because you dealt with them? Because I 
dealt with them and learned that you couldn't

13:52.497 --> 13:55.800
trust them. For instance, back in combat now, you 
can talk about trusting them. And this is an

14:02.606 --> 14:06.670
English colonel. We were up in repelling Germany. 
It's not too far from Aachen. We'd had some

14:17.620 --> 14:21.765
tremendous firefights. Some of the worst 
fighting in the whole door-to-door fighting for

14:21.785 --> 14:27.392
doughboys.

14:29.775 --> 14:35.543
And I had my headquarters in a monastery at took us 
in, and it was a dry place, a warm place, or at least

14:36.417 --> 14:48.930
it wasn't cold, let's set it that way, it wasn't 
warm, but it was probably 50, 55, something like

14:36.417 --> 14:48.930
that in there, and they kept it livable, but 
nothing else. And I was out on about my chores one

14:51.053 --> 15:01.644
day, and I came back, and I saw an English Jeep right 
in front of my gate. And I looked in there, and

15:01.664 --> 15:06.289
here's a map board, you know what a map board is, 
about a square with a map of the area on it, and he's

15:07.045 --> 15:12.413
got his locations pointed around. And there's my 
battalion area, and my battalion headquarters

15:13.114 --> 15:20.164
marked on the map board, in an unguarded jeep. And 
this colonel had taken his belt off with his pistol

15:22.347 --> 15:33.103
and laid it on top of his map board, knocked on the 
door, and our guards let him in, and he was in there

15:22.347 --> 15:33.103
waiting for me to come have lunch. Obviously, he 
just came by to say hello. But he timed it so he'd be

15:36.724 --> 15:40.408
there at lunchtime, because they loved to come and 
eat with us. We had good food, and they didn't. So

15:43.051 --> 15:44.652
that's the answer there. But the point I'm making 
is that you can't trust them, because if he handles

15:45.153 --> 16:04.373
top secret data that way, and certainly that's top 
secret to me and top secret to the American Army, my

15:45.153 --> 16:04.373
exact coordinates on the thing, in combat, the 
Germans may be five miles from there, four miles,

15:45.153 --> 16:04.373
something like that. You don't trust them. You 
can't trust them. So I carried that philosophy all

16:09.894 --> 16:13.840
the way through until I got home. So the only ones 
you trusted then were not the British or the

16:14.260 --> 16:18.446
Russians, but only the Americans. Only the 
Americans. An American tells you something,

16:19.728 --> 16:21.491
well, that's gospel. But you couldn't trust the 
other nationals.

16:28.641 --> 16:31.005
He completely exposed my position. Sure. He laid 
his gun on top of it and walked off and left it. Any

16:37.580 --> 16:40.686
German kid could come along, picked up both of 
them, and gone. And that's transmitted back

16:41.187 --> 16:44.975
immediately to the German army. And then they blow 
a kid with that asshole. And that's something that

16:48.843 --> 16:52.450
you don't do. Do you think that the English then 
were as distrustful as the Russians? Or do you

16:58.930 --> 17:00.072
think there was a degree? Well, it's a degree and 
it's maybe a different sense of distrust, but it

17:00.492 --> 17:09.145
boiled down to where you don't trust them. I 
wouldn't give them any confidential

17:09.685 --> 17:13.531
information, any secret information. I just 
wouldn't do it because I didn't know where it was

17:13.551 --> 17:17.256
going. Do you think this is the general feeling 
among the American officers? Well it was in my

17:22.813 --> 17:27.177
area, let's just say it that way. Was there a 
question of superiority or inferiority? I mean

17:29.980 --> 17:35.866
did you think that you were a superior officer or 
did you think your American troops were better

17:29.980 --> 17:35.866
than English or could you comment on that? Well of 
course I always had the attitude that the American

17:36.107 --> 17:43.975
officer was far superior to any of the others.

17:46.738 --> 17:48.880
Just down the line from second lieutenant all the 
way up to the General Eisenhower, there's no

17:49.130 --> 17:51.754
question in my mind about that. On the other hand, 
up there they had their methods of handling this

17:53.296 --> 18:07.735
intelligence business and out in field we had ours 
and on down to my battalion. Now this is back when we

18:08.877 --> 18:12.902
were still in combat, of course. But that fear of 
The unknown is something that you don't get over

18:16.062 --> 18:19.568
once you've been shot at.

18:23.254 --> 18:31.046
Back in combat again, my people knocked down a 
Messerschmitt that had been by. We saw him when he

18:31.186 --> 18:37.176
went by us, and where he went I don't know, but 10 or 
15 minutes away he came back by. and started

18:37.240 --> 18:40.325
unloading his guns on us. We say clearing the 
board, it's getting rid of his ammunition. And

18:45.233 --> 18:46.114
they knocked him down. And our people got over to 
him and first thing he do is cut his signals off here

18:48.037 --> 19:00.377
which gives his rank and his organization and all 
that stuff for intelligence. And they picked up

19:00.397 --> 19:02.961
his clipboard, again his map board. And there's my 
battalion's coordinates on there, and he had it

19:04.173 --> 19:07.958
plotted on his boards. Now how he got it, I don't 
know. But one of these old men that was left in this

19:10.722 --> 19:20.716
little town, or some kid, got the word back through 
their gate, Grapevine, and he knew exactly where

19:10.722 --> 19:20.716
we were. Well, all this is indelibly impressed and 
printed on your memory. Sure. And you can't take

19:26.825 --> 19:30.029
that thing lightly. No, no. So he was probably 
moving in for the kill? He was attempting to bomb

19:35.972 --> 19:38.155
you then? Well, he had a bomb mission, and he went 
and unloaded his bomb, but he came back and

19:38.175 --> 19:49.771
unloaded his machine guns on us, and our people got 
him. But that didn't eradicate my battalion

19:51.253 --> 20:01.046
coordinates off his clipboard. Sure, yeah. So 
what'd you do, move immediately? No, no. We were

20:05.036 --> 20:09.943
cautious about the thing, but we moved in a day or 
two. But you can't move immediately. You've just

20:13.628 --> 20:17.493
got to be super cautious and get ready for them. 
Because there are people close to you on the right,

20:18.174 --> 20:22.220
close to you on the left, and you can't go 
backwards. And you can't go forwards. So you're

20:25.264 --> 20:28.448
hemmed in a goose egg that we operate in. We moved 
gun positions, sure. maybe two, three hundred

20:31.653 --> 20:40.062
yards, so they couldn't fire with their 
long-range artillery or with these flea bombs.

20:41.263 --> 20:43.346
But you can't move. I mean, to get out of country, 
that's what I should say. So I just didn't trust any

20:49.352 --> 20:57.020
of those people that we were working with, and I 
think my fears were justifiable. You know, often

20:57.581 --> 21:01.525
the British, I've read quite a bit about the 
British military and they felt that they'd been in

21:01.775 --> 21:21.274
the war for two years before we even got in the war 
and that they had won battles before we joined the

21:01.775 --> 21:21.274
war effort and that they were rather upset by the 
fact that Americans now came in and were running

21:01.775 --> 21:21.274
the crusade. Did you ever get some negative 
feelings from British officers about this? The

21:26.879 --> 21:28.120
answer is no. I think that's more of a historian's 
fabrication than anything else. It didn't

21:33.985 --> 21:38.852
reflect down in our area. Now the British had been 
occupying countries for several hundred years.

21:44.641 --> 21:46.083
And they knew how to occupy them. For instance, I 
was the northmost, my battalion was the northmost

21:46.744 --> 21:56.419
American outfit in the Ninth Army. and the second 
British Army was right on our border, which means a

21:57.091 --> 22:07.102
lot of times we'd get into their area and a lot of 
times they'd get into our area and you can't help

21:57.091 --> 22:07.102
it. But conflict like that, I mean conflict 
meaning cross boundaries. One day we got word the

22:13.549 --> 22:23.841
night before that we were gonna move out and we were 
really relieved by a British artillery outfit.

22:24.563 --> 22:35.654
which meant that Army or Corps or somebody had 
swapped a boundary, you know, and they would come

22:24.563 --> 22:35.654
in and take our area, and maybe we were going to move 
south a little bit or something. I don't remember.

22:37.656 --> 22:49.108
But this Lieutenant Colonel, battalion 
commander, came in my headquarters about 9.30, 10

22:37.656 --> 22:49.108
o'clock in the morning. He was British, no? 
British. came in to take over the area. And I said,

22:54.473 --> 22:55.755
hell, I ain't going nowhere. I'm happy right here. 
Nothing happening, you know. All's quiet, and all

22:59.481 --> 23:07.134
we're doing is firing a little harassment fire, 
and no problems. We're not going anywhere. And he

23:09.458 --> 23:13.925
said, oh, yeah, you're going here, and I'm 
supposed to take over the area. And I said, oh,

23:13.945 --> 23:16.450
shit. I'm not going anywhere. I don't know 
anything about it. And we talked about some cities

23:19.897 --> 23:26.447
that he and I had both been in, you know. We'd passed 
over there, you know. Oh, it

23:28.770 --> 23:41.609
was 11, 30, something like this time we got down to 
getting ready for lunch, and I asked him if he'd

23:28.770 --> 23:41.609
like to stay for lunch with us. And

23:42.992 --> 23:47.338
he said he would. But he was anxious to get his 
people, meaning his equipment and all, coming in

23:48.027 --> 23:53.534
and taking over our area. And I said, I ain't going 
nowhere. I don't have any orders to go anywhere.

23:58.020 --> 23:59.963
Did you call back to headquarters then? Did I call 
back to headquarters? Well, I knew I was going to

24:01.425 --> 24:04.188
move, but I knew I wasn't going to move until about 
4.30. I think it's 4.30 that afternoon. And I

24:06.151 --> 24:09.836
wouldn't give him the satisfaction of letting him 
know about it. Why not? Well, I didn't know. I was

24:13.137 --> 24:18.283
still responsible for fire if the soldiers in 
front of us had needed it, till 430. And I couldn't

24:19.624 --> 24:22.687
be getting up and moving out and letting him go up. 
Then my core artillery officer called for a

24:23.088 --> 24:26.792
certain fire. And I said, hell, General, I can't 
give it to you. I'm moving. This is, line me up if you

24:29.755 --> 24:32.098
want me to move out early. I just wouldn't give him 
any satisfaction at all, because I had that

24:34.020 --> 24:40.647
responsibility.

24:41.605 --> 24:42.807
He had lunch with us. And after lunch, I got up and 
walked around. And of course, he could see our

24:44.950 --> 24:51.480
people had the information to get ready to leave at 
430. And he could see the preparations. He knew

24:53.523 --> 24:54.604
something was cooking. But I would never admit it 
to him. But walked out in his, by that time, he had

24:57.609 --> 25:03.057
his. It's battalion commander's party there. Now 
that battalion commander's party is his staff,

25:06.479 --> 25:12.809
his wire section, and all that kind of business. 
And there were two Studebaker trucks. I'd never

25:17.636 --> 25:28.133
seen a Studebaker truck, a six by six, you know, 
with a bow top and a canvas on it and all buttoned

25:17.636 --> 25:28.133
down, battened down like it, they had something in 
there really secret. And I admired them and I asked

25:28.687 --> 25:34.136
him how they ran and where he got them and this kind 
of business. And of course it's all a land lease

25:35.298 --> 25:38.284
business. But I picked up the tarp and looked in 
there and my God, completely full of Budweiser

25:40.748 --> 25:48.241
canned beer. Two of them. I had never seen any 
Budweiser canned beer in Europe. And that was his

25:54.742 --> 25:59.909
ration, or he was responsible for issuing it, or 
something. I never did find out what that was. But

26:02.672 --> 26:06.057
there again, a light lit up in my brain. And

26:07.559 --> 26:16.791
I got to thinking that I would somehow get some of 
that beer. I got to negotiating in my own mind. And

26:21.477 --> 26:23.500
about 3 o'clock in the afternoon,

26:25.893 --> 26:29.938
He could see us starting to get our headquarters 
ready to move out. There's no question about it, he

26:29.998 --> 26:31.259
knew it. And I said, well, I just got word, of course 
I got away from him and came back and I just got a

26:31.760 --> 26:37.627
message that we were gonna move out. We got to start 
picking up a wire and all. Our wire, we must have had

26:41.332 --> 26:47.479
a

26:41.332 --> 26:47.479
hundred miles of wire strung out. An artillery 
outfit gets awfully strung out and that's quite a

26:47.940 --> 26:53.166
chore. And he asked me twice, how about leaving 
that wire intact so he wouldn't have to string it?

27:02.241 --> 27:03.382
And I just told him, no way. Now, what kind of wire is 
this? This is telephone wire. I see. So you can talk

27:06.846 --> 27:08.488
to all the units. Well, I wouldn't talk to all the 
units, theoretically in secret, rather than on

27:08.508 --> 27:13.032
the radio. See, the radio exposes you to where you 
are. Sure, the airway, sure. And it's wide open for

27:16.295 --> 27:21.220
intelligence, where wire theoretically isn't. 
They can tap wire just... by putting a clip on it,

27:23.065 --> 27:24.887
and that's that. But we run it enough to know if it's 
being done. I said, we run it, meaning have a walker

27:28.490 --> 27:37.159
walk in the lines, keep them in service, and be sure 
nobody's tampering with them. And I said, no way.

27:38.641 --> 27:47.129
Of course, that gave me the idea of it was getting 
old, and we had done a lot of maintenance on it,

27:38.641 --> 27:47.129
meaning tying it, patching it, and this kind of 
thing. And it was leaking, so that gave me the idea

27:47.149 --> 27:53.055
of just battle losing the wire. And about 3.30, I 
guess, I made a deal with this old boy that we'd

27:54.503 --> 28:09.387
leave our wire intact

27:54.503 --> 28:09.387
for enough beer to give every one of my people a can 
of beer. And he didn't go for that very well. But

28:13.754 --> 28:15.337
then again, he got to thinking about it. And that's 
what we did. We traded that wire intact, in place.

28:20.440 --> 28:23.524
for a can of beer for every one of my people, 400 and 
some odd cans of beer. Well, those things happen.

28:29.392 --> 28:32.095
The end of the story is... Well, why didn't you have 
any Budweiser over there? I don't understand

28:32.115 --> 28:32.696
that. I don't know, I don't know. Didn't you have 
any American canned beer? They had American beer,

28:36.021 --> 28:42.269
yes, but there again, I hadn't seen any Budweiser. 
And

28:43.691 --> 28:49.198
we rarely got it. because we were a Army battalion. 
That thing comes in the Army, goes to Corps, down to

28:54.115 --> 28:59.063
divisions. And see, we weren't a part of any 
division. We were separate troops, an Army

29:02.689 --> 29:06.816
battalion. And we just didn't get it. I mean, the 
division's supposed to service us. We're taxed to

29:14.045 --> 29:22.294
them for rations and supplies, meaning rations to 
food and ammunition, gasoline, that kind of

29:14.045 --> 29:22.294
business. But we take orders for firing from 
somebody else. And that was one of the

29:28.000 --> 29:37.410
deficient points of being a separate battalion. 
You were kind of like a bastard at a family reunion.

29:41.967 --> 29:46.672
They wanted you when they needed your fire, but 
they didn't want to service your outfit. Anyway, I

29:47.934 --> 30:01.609
introduced this English commander to, we had 
lunch, and of course we used our field kitchens and

29:47.934 --> 30:01.609
all. It was

30:02.270 --> 30:07.836
what you would expect in combat. It wasn't a mess 
line for the officer's mess, but it was, we used

30:08.339 --> 30:20.045
plates and knives and forks, but we didn't have 
tablecloths, we didn't have napkins, we were in

30:08.339 --> 30:20.045
the field. But this, I introduced this... Did you 
have hot food done? Oh, you bet. For the men and for

30:25.637 --> 30:27.742
the officers? Oh, you bet. Yes, sir. That's one 
thing that I was adamant about. We didn't serve

30:31.882 --> 30:35.407
food unless it was hot, and we took it to the men. 
They didn't have to walk a half mile, a mile to get a

30:35.988 --> 30:38.472
meal. We took it to the men. They drove it out on a 
jeep? Drove it out on a jeep or in a command car,

30:40.735 --> 30:43.919
whatever they had available, you know. Bet you 
they liked that. Well, sure. Well, you had to take

30:46.823 --> 30:51.149
care of them. But I introduced this British 
colonel, this commander, to... the German that

30:58.036 --> 31:00.879
owned this house we were in. And he talked to him in 
German.

31:07.305 --> 31:08.225
He could talk German. And he told him he wanted to 
get the silver out on the table for supper. He

31:13.590 --> 31:15.292
wanted tablecloths and napkins. He wanted the 
rugs put back on the floor. He wanted the finest

31:19.195 --> 31:24.180
china that they had and all. And they got it. I 
kidded my executive officer about it after it was

31:28.394 --> 31:41.394
all over and we went back there a day or two later 
just out of curiosity and there's all the china and

31:28.394 --> 31:41.394
everything on the table. I said something to my 
executive officer about the English sure knew how

31:41.414 --> 31:53.693
to occupy a country and he said well after all 
Colonel they've been occupying countries for 300

31:41.414 --> 31:53.693
years they ought to learn something. So that's the 
difference in American forces and the English

31:54.078 --> 32:01.088
forces.

32:04.233 --> 32:15.850
We were transferred, we got cut off in the bulls 
from the American army and we were transferred for

32:04.233 --> 32:15.850
command purposes to the Second British Army under 
General Montgomery. The next day, General

32:17.467 --> 32:19.570
Montgomery came down there. He sent us a letter 
welcoming us. I guess there were a half dozen units

32:22.495 --> 32:24.838
doing this. But the next day, the old man came down 
and shook my hand and said, glad to have you in his

32:25.700 --> 32:31.128
army. You bet. What did you think of him? Well, he 
was a tremendous personality. That's all I know

32:36.236 --> 32:37.478
about him. We were in his outfit for maybe a week or 
something like this before we were referred back

32:38.780 --> 32:45.550
to the 9th Army. He came down and welcomed us. So 
there's a different aspect of the English

32:50.032 --> 32:53.855
officer. That was just a good public relation deal 
on his part. It was good soldiering on his part. And

33:02.864 --> 33:11.853
we, my battalion, and I'm sure my superiors 
appreciated it, because I couldn't help but

33:02.864 --> 33:11.853
report it to them. Did the Americans do that on your 
guys? I mean, did an American general come when you

33:15.550 --> 33:20.115
were assigned to a new area? Did they come in and 
welcome you to their... No, basically you

33:20.356 --> 33:24.701
reported to them. I see. And I always went and 
reported to them. Sometimes generals would

33:28.505 --> 33:32.790
welcome me and sometimes he'd be busy as hell. I'd 
see him, I'd see his exec or the operation officer

33:32.890 --> 33:40.900
or somebody and let them know we were there and 
ready to go. He'd say, well, we're glad to have you

33:41.761 --> 33:44.764
and we need you or something and that's it. What did 
your men think of Montgomery coming down? A big

33:50.343 --> 33:50.823
pardon? What did your men think? Oh, they were 
thrilled about it. They appreciated it. They

33:56.068 --> 33:58.350
rarely saw a senior officer. If they saw a general 
once a month, he was just driving by. But they never

34:05.037 --> 34:10.883
came and

34:05.037 --> 34:10.883
made a talk to him. And General Montgomery made a 
talk to my headquarters battery. And of course, he

34:15.389 --> 34:17.812
was talking to the whole battalion. But my 
headquarters barrier was right around my

34:18.533 --> 34:24.499
headquarters, and I could get up 50, 60 people 
without any trouble, you know. And he just came

34:25.500 --> 34:32.649
down and said, hello, welcome, and we're glad to 
have you, and anything you need, well, let me know

34:25.500 --> 34:32.649
about it, and I'll get it for you. And that's it. And 
do they do that? Do they get you supplies? Well,

34:35.772 --> 34:44.502
yeah, they furnish the supplies, meaning

34:35.772 --> 34:44.502
gasoline and food and That kind of stuff. Was there 
a difference between the food that they supplied

34:45.551 --> 34:49.938
versus the food that the 9th Army? Oh, it was 
American food. It was all American C rations or K

34:51.340 --> 34:54.765
rations. I don't mean K or D rations.

35:00.153 --> 35:02.056
Basically, it was all American food. We were 
supplying them. Sure. Lend-lease. Lend-lease.

35:08.325 --> 35:09.427
Give them the food. That's so much of my experience 
with General Montgomery. And by the same token,

35:14.350 --> 35:18.777
I'll tell you a story of General Eisenhower. When 
we were back in the Hocken area, Hocken was the

35:18.857 --> 35:29.654
center of Charlemagne's domain. That was his 
capital during his reign, and he had a summer

35:29.974 --> 35:40.290
palace maybe 25 miles southeast of there at 
Cornelie Munster. It was his summer palace and

35:42.565 --> 35:47.772
beautiful place, square block with a cloister all 
the way around it. It was a beautiful place, castle

35:47.832 --> 35:51.216
type of thing. I had to go down and see the Army 
artillery officer. We were in the 9th Army at that

35:56.362 --> 35:57.924
time. About something, I don't remember what it 
was. I got down to Cornelia Munster, oh I got within

36:02.470 --> 36:06.575
a half mile of it. And the MP stopped me and says, You 
can't go any further. And of course, I asked him,

36:15.012 --> 36:16.514
why not? What the hell's happening here? I got 
business down at the Army headquarters with an

36:18.355 --> 36:21.218
Army artillery officer. He says, well, sir, if 
you've got business down there, of course, he

36:22.239 --> 36:28.966
checked my password and counter password and all 
this kind of business. And he was able to verify

36:28.986 --> 36:36.434
that I was current as far as security was 
concerned. He said, well, if you've got to go down

36:36.934 --> 36:40.618
there, you'll have to walk, because my orders are 
no vehicles past this point. And I'm sorry, but

36:43.518 --> 36:44.940
that's my orders. And about that time, the MP 
sergeant came up and asked what the trouble was.

36:50.047 --> 36:51.249
And I said, I just want to drive down. I've got to go 
to the Army artillery officer's office. And

36:55.515 --> 36:57.198
frankly, I don't know where it is. I've never been 
there. He said, well, Colonel, you can go down

36:58.019 --> 37:07.873
there, but you have to walk, because no vehicle is 
going past this stop point. And of course, all I

37:07.893 --> 37:09.656
could do is say, well, that's your orders. Thank 
you very much, Sergeant. And how'd I get there? And

37:12.550 --> 37:16.616
he showed me the roads to take and you could see the 
castle over here. He showed me and he said, now you

37:17.377 --> 37:25.209
go down to the far southeast corner and that's the 
gate to use and you get in on it. And I'm sure I was

37:25.910 --> 37:31.398
stopped a dozen times walking by different 
sentinels. All of them checking the password and

37:32.740 --> 37:40.592
the counter password and my business and who I was 
and my identity and all. And that was all right. In

37:42.459 --> 37:52.072
retrospect, I admired it, but then it was a chore 
and a pain in the neck because it was hindering me,

37:42.459 --> 37:52.072
and I was busy, and I had something else to do. So I'd 
mess with those people, but anyway, I got there. I

37:56.458 --> 38:10.056
started down the hall, and this group of gentlemen 
came out of a conference room or a big room, and

37:56.458 --> 38:10.056
General Eisenhower, General Montgomery, some 
French general, all American men, four-star and

38:10.711 --> 38:12.233
three-star generals. I'd never seen so many 
general officers in my life. General Patton was

38:16.818 --> 38:21.804
there, General Bradley was there, General 
Simpson was there, General Hodges was there. Of

38:21.844 --> 38:23.546
course, I recognized them. And as I approached 
them, they were walking toward me and General

38:24.787 --> 38:28.471
Montgomery and General Smith. It was Peter Smith, 
his number one aide, helper. and gentlemen were

38:34.741 --> 38:58.504
leading the pack coming up and of course I just 
approached them and kept going until I got within

38:34.741 --> 38:58.504
10 or 15 feet of them and I backed up against the wall 
and took my helmet off and said good morning

38:34.741 --> 38:58.504
gentlemen and General Eisenhower wheeled out of 
the two and came over and said good morning and I

38:34.741 --> 38:58.504
reported my name to him and what my battalion 
number is And he said, I've heard good things about

38:59.125 --> 39:01.308
that kid. Well, that's a fine battalion. You keep 
up the good work, boy, and he had been stomached

39:02.469 --> 39:05.293
like that, and that's all there was to it. Really? 
Yeah, that's right. And like I say, I never saw the

39:08.096 --> 39:12.181
number, the jillions of generals. A brigadier 
general was just like peons at this conference.

39:19.310 --> 39:21.613
What it was all about, I don't know to this day. I 
didn't try to inquire about it because none of my

39:21.693 --> 39:25.598
business. But that was the reason for all this 
security. I've often thought what a lucrative

39:29.720 --> 39:38.656
target that would have been to some German 
airplane going by and just decided, well, I'll

39:29.720 --> 39:38.656
unload my bombs and let them have it. Because the 
whole

39:39.457 --> 39:49.315
safe headquarters and brains was there. But 
that's two stories about General Eisenhower in

39:50.712 --> 39:53.275
Montgomery. Well, what did you think about 
Eisenhower when he did that? Well, it blew me up ten

39:55.837 --> 40:03.325
foot tall, and my damn shoulders went back, and my 
stomach pulled in, and it was the thrill of my life.

40:03.445 --> 40:03.785
I bet. It was the thrill of my life, and I couldn't 
help but tell the artillery officer about it, and

40:04.286 --> 40:11.914
he just lay and said, well, that's Ike or 
something. You know, he just passed it off. Was

40:15.578 --> 40:17.159
that Eisenhower was known for that? Well... He was 
known as being a soldier's soldier. He'd stop and

40:21.990 --> 40:23.232
talk to soldiers. And of course, he could see I was 
in combat, and probably dirty and muddy and filthy

40:24.113 --> 40:30.481
and all. I was adamant about two things, about my 
people being clean shaven, and as long as I could

40:33.285 --> 40:41.836
brush my teeth, well, I was in good shape. I could be 
dirty, and my clothes filthy, and my boots muddy

40:42.938 --> 40:48.445
and all, and I didn't pay attention to it. all day's 
work, but I was clean shaven, had a decent haircut.

40:55.281 --> 40:58.746
I certainly had a soldier's haircut. How was 
Eisenhower's luck? Great, great. He was

41:01.530 --> 41:12.506
energetic,

41:01.530 --> 41:12.506
enthusiastic, and I'll never forget him hitting 
me in the stomach like that. Keep up the good work,

41:12.586 --> 41:14.949
boy. And, of course, I couldn't help but tell that 
to my driver going back, and and the damn driver

41:18.563 --> 41:27.414
told all the battering and all the battalion and 
the story got out, I guess, holy to you. But that was

41:28.595 --> 41:31.279
my experience with Jim Ladner. I admired him 
tremendously. It didn't take him 15 seconds to do

41:34.443 --> 41:37.607
it. But it indelibly impressed on me that he was a 
great person.

41:44.872 --> 41:45.733
I thought for one. Very thoughtful, very 
thoughtful. He was down here on a momentous

41:47.616 --> 41:54.026
mission and he made some decisions and he said you 
do this, I'm sure. What he did was lay down the

41:54.066 --> 41:58.352
battle order and we would get a follow-up. Or he 
wouldn't have had all of his field generals in, I

41:58.372 --> 42:08.607
mean the four-star generals, the army generals, 
and he,

41:58.372 --> 42:08.607
I guess all the way down to division. I was Oh, was he 
in fatigues or was he in dress? Oh, no, no, no. He was

42:14.531 --> 42:17.875
in his ODs with his jacket and all. And all of them 
were. It was a dress performance for them. I never

42:24.222 --> 42:25.383
saw him in fatigues. I never saw him but one time. 
But he was a great person in my opinion.

42:35.715 --> 42:37.978
In retrospect, I can understand of all the 
security. Sure. Absolutely. Like you said, one

42:42.365 --> 42:43.667
mile an hour. Paying the next start with, but I can 
understand it. Anyway, I got out of there and did my

42:47.632 --> 42:56.644
business, got what information I needed or got 
whatever I went after. Probably needed some help

42:57.545 --> 43:05.115
on some ammunition or something like that, you 
know, and I couldn't get through normal channels.

43:05.467 --> 43:10.234
You go visit those people, you can shake them loose 
because they're always sitting on some extra.

43:10.455 --> 43:13.580
It's a question of tapping the right source. You 
learn to be pretty self-enterprising as a

43:15.502 --> 43:21.832
separate unit commander because you've got to go 
get everything you want. It's not automatic

43:22.033 --> 43:23.996
coming down to you every day. And if you're not 
enterprising, you just get left. I was wondering a

43:34.576 --> 43:40.142
little bit about your schedule out in the field 
during combat. Was there anything, of course your

43:40.762 --> 43:43.826
men have to have some time off. They certainly get 
tired. They get tired of combat too. They must have

43:47.730 --> 43:58.721
to have some liberty sometime or have a few beers or 
drinks or something just to encourage them if

43:47.730 --> 43:58.721
there's something besides combat. How did that 
work? Well, yes and no.

44:05.845 --> 44:08.088
You don't operate in combat by watch. Oh, for sure. 
Timing. Absolutely. Basically, you've got your

44:11.573 --> 44:13.316
three meals a day. Breakfast is sun up and lunch in 
the middle of the day and your evening meal. And you

44:19.324 --> 44:23.009
operate around those three fixed points of time. 
Now, if you're in the middle of a fire mission and

44:23.570 --> 44:28.697
come dinner time, your dinner waits. If it's an 
extended mission, why don't you infiltrate? one

44:32.980 --> 44:39.327
or two men out of your section of time goes back and 
gets his food and comes back and eats it right there

44:32.980 --> 44:39.327
between fire missions.

44:42.070 --> 44:43.932
Men understand that, don't they? They understand 
it and they cooperate and coordinate and live with

44:43.952 --> 44:49.819
it. You don't have any grousing about time off or 
working 40 hours a week or anything like that. They

44:56.526 --> 44:59.430
work seven days a day around the clock. Then again, 
when... Your mission's over, and you can see a lull

45:01.938 --> 45:05.242
in the thing. You completely relax, and if they 
want to go to get their meals, fine. If they don't,

45:10.288 --> 45:11.029
fine.

45:13.972 --> 45:16.055
You say relax and have a beer or drink. The answer to 
that is, there's no way that we furnish them with

45:18.077 --> 45:21.702
that. The American soldiers in Pride and Soul in 
the little towns, if there was any beer around, he

45:23.724 --> 45:31.033
found it.

45:32.060 --> 45:34.182
He requisitioned it, if that's a good word. If in a 
house, a blown-out house or something, he'd get in

45:35.203 --> 45:44.031
there and find a bottle of schnapps where they'd 
take it back to the section and drink it. And

45:45.072 --> 46:01.206
it was a very informal thing,

45:45.072 --> 46:01.206
but when time came to move, you could interrupt him 
in anything, and he understood it was time to move,

45:45.072 --> 46:01.206
and he moved. meaning one of the finest things that 
my battalion ever did, and we did that back in

46:02.080 --> 46:20.206
France, went through a farmhouse and

46:02.080 --> 46:20.206
they found a upright piano. And one of my wire 
section boys could play a piano. So they

46:26.395 --> 46:31.362
requisitioned this piano and put it in a wire truck 
up against the, the cab, covered it up with wire so I

46:31.780 --> 46:35.586
wouldn't know anything about it. And after so long 
time, every time we'd set up shop somewhere, got

46:36.607 --> 46:47.423
all the wire in and time to do it, there was 
something where this soldier would start playing

46:36.607 --> 46:47.423
piano. And I'd happen by there and I'd see the same 
damn piano and find out, I'd ask the wire chief what

46:48.465 --> 46:54.453
goes here. And he'd say, oh, we requisitioned that 
back in some old town of France. And that was a great

47:00.434 --> 47:03.797
source of relaxation for that wire section.

47:06.820 --> 47:08.661
They kept at the end all the way in Germany. 
Frankly, I don't know what happened to it. But they

47:11.824 --> 47:14.346
asked me if we could keep it. And I said, sure, just 
as long as it doesn't become a burden to you in your

47:14.446 --> 47:20.512
wire section. You've got to haul so many miles of 
wire. And as long as you've got that wire there and

47:24.135 --> 47:28.939
you can transport it, that's fine. And so this 
piano was a great source of relaxation for my whole

47:30.522 --> 47:46.278
headwaters, because they'd all wander in and 
they'd hear the music, you know, and they'd wander

47:30.522 --> 47:46.278
in and time off.

47:46.298 --> 47:47.039
It was a great thing. It was a great thing. Did you 
ever give anyone leave to go back to Paris or

47:49.442 --> 47:54.927
anything like that? No. How did that work? Yes and 
no.

48:02.956 --> 48:08.404
The Army very quickly, after VE Day, set up rest 
centers. They didn't do it, to my knowledge. Well,

48:11.750 --> 48:12.511
they did, too. They did, too.

48:17.098 --> 48:20.844
Still in combat, they had some rest centers down in 
the French Riviera. They were in Cannes and Nice.

48:31.255 --> 48:35.480
And it went over nearly somewhere on the Italian 
Adriatic Sea. And every now and then, I guess the

48:37.883 --> 48:43.249
Army and the Division got quarters. And there 
again, they weren't any quarters for separate

48:44.231 --> 48:46.874
troops. We didn't get any quarters. And until 
after VE Day, then we got quarters.

48:57.884 --> 48:59.706
The portals were all used up by the time they got to 
us. That's the only excuse they had. They were all

49:02.008 --> 49:03.069
given that. And so I followed up on that thing. And 
for a share, I was telling them to shake it up. There

49:09.395 --> 49:12.478
were too few in the portal. But once VGD happened, 
well, we got quarters. And we'd get into people who

49:18.804 --> 49:22.027
had gotten hurt first. And then the ones that had 
the most combat had to work it on down to the latest

49:22.047 --> 49:27.773
man.

49:29.153 --> 49:30.674
Did you ever go to one of these restaurants? I'm 
sorry? Did you ever go to one of these restaurants?

49:32.656 --> 49:33.597
Yeah, I went back to England. I got to fly back to 
England one time. Between transfers, and I think

49:36.960 --> 49:43.086
it was between transfers from the 777 battalion to 
the 745 battalion. That's where I remember it.

49:45.588 --> 49:52.514
When I got the telephone, oh, I think it was 
transferring from the 777 to the 745. Which one?

49:54.096 --> 49:55.197
How much time did it give you? Well, I had five or six 
nights. There

49:59.512 --> 50:06.326
again, the light, I pulled the switch and the light 
turned on for me. I didn't have any relaxation or

50:07.568 --> 50:13.240
anything else. The whole time, I just transferred 
to 745 Battalion.
