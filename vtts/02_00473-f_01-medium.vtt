WEBVTT

00:01.128 --> 00:11.141
And he ended up as a full general command of the Air 
Force Command, and he retired not too long ago.

00:11.202 --> 00:11.522
Yeah, right. Oh, yeah, I remember he was the first 
black officer in the Air Force. I mean the highest,

00:18.471 --> 00:21.535
the first one to become general, I mean. Yeah, 
yeah. And he was under your command? At Massawa,

00:25.200 --> 00:26.262
yeah. He must have been good then. Yeah, he was 
real, I mean he was real good. Mm-hmm. And my wife

00:30.980 --> 00:43.173
was mentioning last night that actually we had one 
colored pilot that came into Massawa down to

00:30.980 --> 00:43.173
Isozuki when we were there. And no one wanted to fly 
with him. Really? And so I said, okay, I'll be his

00:46.857 --> 00:50.522
co-pilot. So I took on the job of being his 
co-pilot. Then it just, everything fell in the

00:53.745 --> 00:57.389
line. So he wasn't...

01:02.468 --> 01:16.963
He wasn't put on a pedestal or he had any problems, 
which I'd forgotten about, but he was probably my

01:02.468 --> 01:16.963
first, and I don't remember his name. Well that 
was, you were demonstrating to them that if you

01:18.444 --> 01:24.851
could do it, they could do it. Yeah, they could do 
it. If I didn't mind by then, then they shouldn't

01:25.832 --> 01:30.437
mind type of thing. Well that was a good idea. Now, 
it seems like what you're doing when you become the

01:32.337 --> 01:44.173
commander of the 39th Air Division is you're 
immediately trying to demonstrate that you're

01:32.337 --> 01:44.173
different from the former commander. Well, I 
think that's a... Is that the theme? That's the

01:47.938 --> 01:49.560
theme. Because he had been a poor commander and you 
wanted to get this place in shape. Now, was that a

01:55.728 --> 02:01.095
threat that your commander told you that he's 
giving you three months? Did you take it as a

02:01.514 --> 02:03.016
threat? Oh, yeah, well, no. Well, actually, I took 
it a different way in that I took it with the idea

02:04.679 --> 02:30.677
that he'd just give me a free rein of doing whatever 
I thought was necessary to getting Masawa kind of

02:04.679 --> 02:30.677
straightened out, and that he wasn't going to be 
sending any IG teams up there to investigate some

02:04.679 --> 02:30.677
of my programs or anything like this. And of course 
I kept him informed. Sure. What he think of sending

02:34.321 --> 02:38.986
250 men back to the states? Well,

02:39.006 --> 02:42.990
he didn't object. I mean as far as I was concerned, I 
figured I could get along without those 250

02:43.050 --> 02:56.344
without even any replacements.

02:57.944 --> 03:10.297
I think some of the men and people when they got back 
to the port of embarkation here in the States were

02:57.944 --> 03:10.297
taken off of the discharge list and reassigned. 
But

03:10.317 --> 03:17.464
he supported me a hundred percent. Another thing 
you said about that is that I could do it then, but I

03:22.970 --> 03:28.818
probably couldn't get away with that today in the 
Air Force. What could you explain? Well, today why

03:30.520 --> 03:50.007
you have the minority is the

03:30.520 --> 03:50.007
underdog type of thing, that you just can't 
discharge a lot of people. for offenses such as

03:50.695 --> 03:55.841
being drunk and disorderly, this type of thing. 
And it's a lot harder to bypass what you might call

03:56.722 --> 04:05.532
civil rights. I mean, this is a civil right. I mean, 
an individual, some guy is just deciding that

04:08.436 --> 04:18.728
because he has been drunk and disorderly two or 
three times that he was unsatisfactory to the Air

04:19.298 --> 04:27.150
Force and he was sending him home just upon his own 
judgment. The individual's civil rights were

04:27.831 --> 04:33.018
being violated. So you had to go into a big board and 
have a group of individuals decide whether or not I

04:33.038 --> 04:43.534
was right or wrong. But did you think back in 1959 
that you were violating their civil rights? And do

04:49.203 --> 04:50.184
you think that today? No, I don't think. I just 
think that it was just a matter of circumstances.

04:58.954 --> 05:14.533
And I would certainly say that a percentage of 
those, maybe 25%, or 33% or 30%, could have been

04:58.954 --> 05:14.533
rehabilitated.

05:15.863 --> 05:20.029
As far as I'm concerned at the time, I just didn't 
have time. What happened to this man, this

05:21.010 --> 05:23.614
Lieutenant Colonel? He was a fairly high ranking 
officer, and he was the highest one that you sent

05:23.634 --> 05:28.861
back. What happened to him? He was one of the ones 
that was pulled off at the POE and reassigned.

05:38.712 --> 05:41.055
I mean, as far as I was concerned, it was always 
alright with me. I didn't make any difference. You

05:42.517 --> 05:44.740
just wanted to get rid of them from your base. I 
wanted to get them out of my base. Now, you were

05:48.024 --> 05:52.830
talking about being drunk and disorderly. What 
other type of offenses would you send these

05:53.371 --> 05:58.718
officers and enlisted men home for? Just any time 
they went up twice to Captain's Mass or? No, well,

06:04.700 --> 06:33.998
see you had an article, what you call an article 15, 
where the individual appeared before the

06:04.700 --> 06:33.998
commander, his commander, for being absent

06:04.700 --> 06:33.998
from AWOL for a couple days, or

06:04.700 --> 06:33.998
numerous speeding violations on base,

06:04.700 --> 06:33.998
or which indicated that he really didn't pay too 
much attention to regulation. And in those cases,

06:41.622 --> 06:49.712
he had to have done this two or three times, I mean 
four, five, six times. It wasn't just a one or two or

06:49.792 --> 06:54.338
three time offense. So I was looking for 
individuals who really didn't pay too much

06:54.559 --> 07:03.951
attention to regulations and that they're 
maintaining airplanes, why they would have the

07:04.690 --> 07:10.056
same attitude. You also mentioned, one of the 
things that you mentioned was some gentleman, and

07:11.678 --> 07:22.290
this I think is interesting, some gentleman, 
something about his morals. He was married and he

07:22.310 --> 07:25.393
was running around with Japanese women or 
something like that. Well, he was living, he was

07:25.433 --> 07:28.837
sleeping off base with some Japanese woman. He had 
a wife and a bunch of kids at home. Back in the United

07:32.483 --> 07:33.545
States. Back in the United States. And was it 
pretty typical to discipline back in 1959 in the

07:34.967 --> 07:41.257
50s Air Force? Was it fairly typical for a general 
officer, his commanding officer then, to

07:41.277 --> 07:46.945
discipline this man? Was he an enlisted man or an 
officer? No, he was an officer. He was an officer.

07:50.992 --> 07:57.101
And I consider that as conduct unbecoming of an 
officer and a gentleman. And it was just one of my

07:57.121 --> 07:58.503
standards. Maybe somebody else wouldn't have... 
Wouldn't have done that. But it straightens up the

08:04.674 --> 08:06.777
base real fast. I mean, maybe I just select one, and 
he goes on. But all the rest of them are doing the

08:12.906 --> 08:15.189
same thing. They move back on base real fast.

08:20.597 --> 08:30.992
OK. Now, what other responsibilities did you have 
besides getting this base into shape as the

08:20.597 --> 08:30.992
commander of the 39th Air Division? Well, there 
are numerous things that you do, whether it was not

08:32.643 --> 08:44.100
too long after the war or after the Korean War. And 
you, as the air bases

08:45.102 --> 09:01.587
closed up, the Air Force air bases closed up, all of 
the spare equipment on base, on those bases, like

09:02.022 --> 09:03.403
was moved down to Misawa. So you end up on base with 
numerous warehouses full of all kinds of

09:03.423 --> 09:13.254
equipment. I think we had, going around and 
searching all the buildings, we found around a

09:13.394 --> 09:28.609
dozen rotating beacons that you put up on a tower at 
each base so that the pilot can see it and head.

09:29.010 --> 09:30.291
Well, we had about eight there. that had been 
shipped in or offloaded from some boat probably

09:30.676 --> 09:44.238
during, after

09:30.676 --> 09:44.238
the war or after World War II or during the Korean 
War. And so we established a program of of shipping

09:48.479 --> 09:56.373
out, declaring a surplus, all of these spare 
equipment. And we shipped out millions of

09:56.393 --> 10:10.437
dollars, declared a surplus, and shipped them 
back to the States, or shipped them to other bases

09:56.393 --> 10:10.437
where you had a need for them. And so you get your 
supply down. Instead of being in four warehouses,

10:14.369 --> 10:19.856
you get your supply down into two warehouses.

10:21.498 --> 10:25.963
And you go through your stock records and the same 
thing. You have the items that you currently use.

10:28.666 --> 10:40.761
Like in an automotive parts warehouse, you'd have 
six

10:28.666 --> 10:40.761
generators for one particular Chevrolet sedan. 
and you look at the record and maybe you used one of

10:41.382 --> 10:46.789
those per year and you had six of them. Well, you 
declare a surplus of six of them to be shipped to

10:46.809 --> 10:54.979
some other base or to be disposed of.

10:59.485 --> 11:06.934
So you got into a stock record type of management 
program where you just saved the Air Force a lot of

10:59.485 --> 11:06.934
money. And you have some time you have to warehouse 
that for six years while it would probably become

11:07.285 --> 11:13.250
rusted anyway. So we had a big program established 
to cut down and as commander I think that there's

11:13.310 --> 11:30.466
nothing more important than having someone hear 
the footsteps of the boss. And you go around and

11:31.426 --> 11:36.651
check your stock records and he knows you're going 
to come around and and check his stock records, and

11:37.222 --> 11:44.050
so he will do it himself. When I left there, I was 
given a metal machine, the sheet metal shopper

11:46.193 --> 12:03.914
made up a box,

11:46.193 --> 12:03.914
which is bits and pieces. I was always going around 
and opening drawers and checking on all these

12:07.512 --> 12:12.619
spare parts that they had. So they made up this

12:12.679 --> 12:19.648
kit and they had everything in the world. This was 
presented to me when I left there. Presented to me

12:22.872 --> 12:24.494
and they had everything in there. They had a dead 
frog that somebody had opened a drawer and there

12:24.514 --> 12:33.045
was a dead frog in it. So they dried, you know, So 
they put that in there. So all kinds of

12:36.252 --> 12:45.282
miscellaneous bits and pieces that

12:36.252 --> 12:45.282
I was known for. And the other thing you can do is,

12:46.183 --> 12:55.794
and this is kind of, I'll agree this is some of these 
kind of nasty, you know. I'd go down to BX during

12:56.475 --> 13:02.882
duty hours and I'd stop maybe three or four airmen 
and find out where they worked. And then I'd run out

13:03.959 --> 13:20.520
of the BX and down to the flight line and I'd go to the 
line chief and I'd say, Robin, I'd like to look at

13:03.959 --> 13:20.520
some of your airplanes here and see what you're 
doing.

13:21.020 --> 13:27.228
And so these boys, there were a couple of boys who 
were down at the BX, I said, well, where is John Doe?

13:27.248 --> 13:32.194
He said, oh, he's around here someplace.

13:32.866 --> 13:34.227
And I said, well, why don't we find him? I know he's 
down there, he's down at the BX in the base exchange

13:34.728 --> 13:40.894
or down there getting coffee or something. And

13:40.955 --> 13:45.479
so we'd try to find him. And then we couldn't find 
him. And I said, well, it looks like to me that you

13:49.464 --> 13:53.728
just don't need him. So I just cut one guy off over 
this guy's management. Well, he was maybe a may

14:01.638 --> 14:04.743
have been assistant crew chief or helper or 
something of this sort. I said, well, I'll just cut

14:04.803 --> 14:10.571
one man off your authorization for manpower. And 
he told me that he had given him permission to go to

14:11.272 --> 14:18.924
BX to get a cup of coffee. That's all I wanted. I 
mean, as long as he knew where the guy was. But if he

14:22.549 --> 14:28.017
didn't know where he was, then I knew he wasn't 
supervising very well. So you were keeping them on

14:29.245 --> 14:31.108
their toes. Oh, yeah. Well, that's the type of 
individual I was. I delved into all the little

14:35.655 --> 14:40.863
activities of everybody. And I think, as I said, I 
think there's nothing more important than

14:40.983 --> 14:47.413
hearing the footsteps of the boss. And then I would 
be out on the flight line watching the safety

14:47.854 --> 14:57.649
procedures and refueling airplanes. Prior to 
that they had some airplanes burn up when they were

14:58.270 --> 15:03.536
refueling. Well the airplane wouldn't be 
properly grounded or the

15:04.216 --> 15:20.373
fuel nozzle wasn't properly grounded when it came 
in contact with the airplane and that causes spark

15:04.216 --> 15:20.373
and that's how it burned up. So you have to Then 
you'd get everybody's brother out there showing

15:25.085 --> 15:31.411
them what they were doing differently. So you had 
to be smart enough to know what the procedures were

15:31.431 --> 15:39.519
to start with.

15:41.862 --> 15:44.524
That's the type of commander I was. I was a detailed 
type of commander. I got into everybody's

15:46.726 --> 15:51.531
business and I didn't sit around the office very 
much. writing instructions to somebody. I was out

15:54.357 --> 16:02.725
there and I got the best people in the top jobs. I 
mean the best majors were the squadron commanders

16:02.885 --> 16:19.020
and the best

16:02.885 --> 16:19.020
sergeants were the crew chiefs and they didn't 
like it because it's cold on the outside. as long as

16:19.523 --> 16:22.486
they got behind the program. And then when you get 
something started, like this is the best air

16:22.586 --> 16:29.774
force, best radio school, the same thing there. 
This is the best fighter out there. And everybody

16:33.277 --> 16:34.759
gets behind it. In fact, you get to the point where 
in some cases the pilots took unnecessary risk in

16:36.581 --> 16:49.294
landing an airplane with a dead engine on the 
runway. So you give him heck for taking too much of a

16:49.645 --> 17:01.780
chance, because you're really interested in 
saving his life, and it would have been better for

16:49.645 --> 17:01.780
him to jump out. But we had a guy, and of course you 
laud him for doing it, but you think he's crazy for

17:01.880 --> 17:09.230
doing it to start with. But he landed an F-102.

17:17.793 --> 17:20.856
without engines on the runway. He just glided in? 
Well, he just glided in. And he did a marvelous job.

17:28.384 --> 17:31.186
And so you didn't have an accident. So you went nine 
months without an accident. And you had to be kind

17:35.471 --> 17:44.400
of a showman type ship, I think, to be a real good 
commander. Like before I went up to Missoula,

17:48.691 --> 18:03.911
General Burns had a flying safety conference of 
all the wing commanders and their flying safety

17:48.691 --> 18:03.911
officers and what have you. So, at 379th I had a very 
good flying safety program there. So, I had gone

18:10.159 --> 18:15.846
around to all the bases, the wings before I went up 
there. and looked at everybody's flying safety

18:17.227 --> 18:25.459
program and inspected their bases. So I knew what 
everybody was doing good and what everybody was

18:25.519 --> 18:29.966
doing bad. And you just plagiarize. You 
plagiarize all good ideas. And so when I went up

18:36.055 --> 18:43.426
there, I had a list of all the best pilots and the 
ones that had two or three accidents. So you knew

18:43.446 --> 18:47.031
the ones to watch on. you knew what everybody else 
was doing, so it is safety. I had not just been up to

18:51.522 --> 18:55.946
Pasado maybe a week. I went down and told them, I 
said, I'm going to go six months without an

18:56.086 --> 19:00.271
aircraft accident. And I told them, this is what 
I'm going to do. And one of them was that the top

19:04.115 --> 19:12.263
maintenance officer in the squadron was going to 
be the flying safety officer. So not only was he

19:15.462 --> 19:18.446
Main, he was also a pilot. No, they were all pilots. 
Not only that, was he a good pilot, but he was also a

19:20.930 --> 19:26.538
good maintenance officer. We had on base a RECO 
squadron which belonged to the wing of Tachikawa.

19:35.811 --> 19:43.883
I wrote a note to the squadron commander, told him 
to provide me with the best pilot and the best

19:35.811 --> 19:43.883
maintenance officer. Well, he furnished me with 
the name of an inexperienced pilot, although he

19:44.251 --> 20:01.306
may have been, he was young, so I called him up and I 
said, look, you provide the guy that was not

19:44.251 --> 20:01.306
qualified, so here's the guy I want. So I just 
picked out his best guy and said, yeah, he's a

20:01.326 --> 20:06.410
flying safety officer for this squadron. Well, 
the wing commander got upset with me, but as I

20:06.430 --> 20:13.937
announced at this down there. I said, well, this is 
what I did. Of course, John Burns backed me up and

20:19.469 --> 20:38.440
after the other wing commander of this 
reconnaissance outfit we became very good

20:19.469 --> 20:38.440
friends because his squadron up there did the same 
things everybody else was doing. So you get up

20:38.926 --> 20:41.429
there with a flare and say, you're going to do this. 
Well, I mean, you're taking a big chance. I'll

20:43.192 --> 20:44.514
agree you're taking a big chance. So you had put 
pressures on you to be sure that you could produce.

20:49.761 --> 20:51.724
What did General Burns think? It sounds like you 
had quite a few accomplishments up there. What did

20:54.708 --> 20:56.811
General Burns think of this? Well, see, I was, 
that's when I was selected from up there and went

20:56.831 --> 21:04.461
into the PACAF headquarters. recommended for 
promotion to Major General there and I don't know.

21:09.794 --> 21:15.302
You were as, when you were in Missoula, you were 
recommended? No, well he selected me for, see that

21:15.502 --> 21:31.765
was a Brigadier General slot, so he selected me to 
come to headquarters PACAF and to be the, his

21:15.502 --> 21:31.765
deputy for plans and operations. as a result of 
what I did up there. I see, so he was quite happy with

21:34.353 --> 21:36.896
your job. Oh yeah, he was. And he tried to promote 
you to a two-star general. Oh yeah, he would come up

21:43.142 --> 21:53.932
on visits and listen to General O'Donnell. He 
said, I had everybody so scared up there that they

21:53.952 --> 21:58.917
were just afraid to have an accident. So, I mean, 
kidding, you know. But, no, I thoroughly enjoyed

22:05.374 --> 22:10.039
it up there. It was up in the boondocks of Massawa. 
We, in the wintertime, no one ever bothered you

22:13.944 --> 22:27.520
because you were just almost no then, and so you 
just were able to run your base just about the way

22:13.944 --> 22:27.520
you wanted to, your division. and I think 
everybody pretty well liked it. Sounds like a real

22:32.929 --> 22:34.652
challenge too. Oh yeah. So I stayed two years up 
there and that was probably my, I enjoyed that

22:36.555 --> 22:45.267
probably as good as anything because I knew what I 
was doing. At that stage you get to the point where

22:45.307 --> 22:51.036
you know exactly what you're doing. See back in the 
315th division way back at Itazuki where that was

22:56.069 --> 23:05.801
really your first command and the rest of them you 
were training, you were in training. That was the

23:06.202 --> 23:13.632
first flying command that you had, so you really 
didn't know what you were doing.

23:17.496 --> 23:22.583
Then I moved from there into PACAF headquarters. 
Before we get to Hawaii, let's talk about waste and

23:24.487 --> 23:29.935
military. Often, every time a fiscal budget comes 
up, people are talking about waste and military.

23:35.663 --> 23:37.485
It sounds like you're trying to prevent that. It 
sounds like one of your major jobs is the 39th Air

23:37.886 --> 23:44.135
Division, as the commander there was, to cut 
waste. Is that the way military commanders

23:44.996 --> 23:48.541
operate? Well, I think that you have a number of 
problems. One of them is Occasionally

23:54.372 --> 24:02.260
you come down from the Secretary of Defense an 
automatic cut. You have to cut 5% of your

24:02.280 --> 24:05.383
personnel. Well, you have to keep about a 5% 
cushion because if you really did your best job and

24:05.403 --> 24:24.042
say, okay, I can cut this guy and this guy and this 
guy out of the staff and I can get along with 200 less

24:24.140 --> 24:35.731
people, and this gets down to the bare bones 
situation, then somebody higher up will say

24:24.140 --> 24:35.731
automatically you just cut 5%. Well, then you have 
a problem, because then you're below what

24:36.252 --> 24:43.759
requires to get your job done. So you do have to keep 
a little slack in. But otherwise, as far as

24:49.425 --> 24:53.809
management of materiel, why I think that the Air 
Force has some of the best managers that you can

24:54.160 --> 25:01.911
find. I mean,

25:02.512 --> 25:11.285
you hear that they sent me to all kinds of schools. I 
mean, they train you in management. I'd go on to

25:12.967 --> 25:19.737
Orlando, take a high-level management course. 
George Washington University, why they had...

25:24.518 --> 25:29.546
management course of four or five weeks that you 
attend. They give you plenty of opportunity to

25:30.548 --> 25:33.733
become a good manager. As

25:34.575 --> 25:51.302
far as I'm concerned,

25:34.575 --> 25:51.302
the managers in the Air Force

25:34.575 --> 25:51.302
are It's about as good as you can find anywhere in 
the world. I think the only problem you have is

25:55.950 --> 25:58.193
they're underpaid. You just think of a squaring 
commander that has 25 airplanes and

25:59.335 --> 26:21.188
whatever it is, 300 or 400 people that he's 
running, and you're paying him a paltry salary of

25:59.335 --> 26:21.188
maybe $18,000 a year or $17,000 a year. And you get 
out in civilian life, and you look at some salesman

26:21.758 --> 26:39.753
who works for a wholesale grocery company, an 
institutional grocer, and he's making $60,000 a

26:21.758 --> 26:39.753
year as both a basic salary plus a bonus. And he's 
home Friday afternoon at around 2 o'clock. He has

26:46.459 --> 26:49.541
no responsibilities until Monday morning. He 
goes out and makes his calls again. And it's to me

26:51.998 --> 27:03.208
why the cream of the Air Force, a guy if he's real 
smart, he won't stay in the Air Force. There are so

27:04.669 --> 27:21.043
many jobs in civilian life that if you,

27:04.669 --> 27:21.043
and I'm on a soapbox now, that the commanders, 
these guys are willing to get out in front and make

27:04.669 --> 27:21.043
decisions. they are the ones that we should be 
paying. Yeah.

27:27.852 --> 27:36.371
Now that we're on this topic, we have a similar 
situation in the profession of teaching. That's

27:36.531 --> 27:37.052
right. In which people who have gone to school and 
done a lot of research and written many different

27:39.856 --> 28:05.227
articles and books, publications, are making 
maybe $20,000, $30,000 a year, where if they had

27:39.856 --> 28:05.227
that type of a position, or they might be a 
department head like at Texas A&M, but if they had

27:39.856 --> 28:05.227
that type of position where they'd be in charge of 
40 or 50 people, they'd be making three or four

27:39.856 --> 28:05.227
times that much in the business world. But the 
question is, Is there a sense of duty in both of

28:08.324 --> 28:11.108
these types of jobs? In the Air Force, for example, 
isn't pay secondary to the challenge and to the

28:11.168 --> 28:19.038
duty, or am I being too idealistic? Can I get a cup of 
coffee? No, you just go ahead. Would you like one?

28:23.805 --> 28:29.252
Well, why don't we cut it off, and I'll get a cup of 
tea.
