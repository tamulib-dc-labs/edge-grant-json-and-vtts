WEBVTT

00:01.465 --> 00:02.827
Testing, one, two, three.

00:12.920 --> 00:14.643
This is an interview with Dr. A.K. Ayub, currently 
a professor in the Department of Electrical

00:14.743 --> 00:18.688
Engineering at Texas A&M. Dr. Ayub, could you tell 
us a little bit about your early years? I was born in

00:24.316 --> 00:26.899
Egypt in 1927. I attended my primary school, got my 
school education after B.Sc. in electrical

00:34.498 --> 00:48.270
engineering in Egypt, and then I came to the United 
States in 1949 on a scholarship to work for a Ph.D.,

00:34.498 --> 00:48.270
a scholarship from the Egyptian government. I got 
my degree in 1955,

00:48.311 --> 00:57.679
and I did do some work for General Electric in 55 and 
56. Then I went to Egypt in 56. Is this early enough?

01:08.723 --> 01:09.785
Yeah, that's fine. Okay, what were your parents' 
occupations? My father is a retired man now. He's

01:14.673 --> 01:16.916
in his 80s and used to be a judge. A judge? Okay. How 
did your interest in electrical engineering

01:20.282 --> 01:22.806
develop? It developed in the late 30s and early 
40s. There was talk in Egypt about constructing

01:31.468 --> 01:47.289
high dams and electric generation from hydro 
plants and the like. And I thought that was very

01:48.431 --> 01:53.518
fascinating, so I did do it there. When did you get 
your Ph.D.? When? Yeah. In 1955, January 1955,

01:57.799 --> 02:02.548
University of Texas in Austin. Okay. What did you 
do your doctoral dissertation on? My

02:07.156 --> 02:14.829
dissertation was on federal residents on power 
systems. Okay. From 1955 until 1961, you worked

02:17.495 --> 02:25.703
for the Ministry of Public Works in Cairo, Egypt, 
in the Mechanical and Engineering Department.

02:25.723 --> 02:27.144
What positions did you hold there? I was a project 
engineer when I got there after my scholarship,

02:28.085 --> 02:46.422
and then I climbed the ladder and I became

02:28.085 --> 02:46.422
what is translated as General Inspector. I was a 
chief engineer for a while, and then I was a general

02:47.330 --> 03:00.444
manager for a while, until 1961, in power 
generation and distribution. Could you compare

03:00.464 --> 03:03.527
engineering in Egypt and the United States? Oh, 
yeah.

03:08.172 --> 03:12.797
Comparing engineering as such is not a very 
precise thing. You see, Egypt had very strong ties

03:13.891 --> 03:20.742
with the United Kingdom for the last 100 years. And 
most of the electrical installations,

03:22.285 --> 03:31.760
electrical practices and codes are more or less 
the British standard.

03:35.246 --> 03:37.890
So, you can say that We're closer to the European 
practices than we are to the States. As you know,

03:41.576 --> 03:49.023
the States is the only place in the world with 60 
cycle businesses.

03:49.223 --> 03:54.389
Other than that, same kind of practices. When you 
left the Ministry of Public Works in 1961, you went

03:54.449 --> 04:01.956
to work for the Atomic Energy Establishment also 
in Cairo. Why did you make this move? Well, see, in

04:04.659 --> 04:07.962
the late 50s, The research and the lust, the 
glamour, the whole field is changing. Power

04:20.857 --> 04:26.542
systems were very stagnant in the way of research. 
And electronics was coming up in one area, you

04:27.563 --> 04:31.887
know, this kind of thing. I felt at the time that, I 
was 35 at the time, I left about 35 years of age, And I

04:39.160 --> 04:44.725
felt like it was time to change a little bit. So I did 
contact and almost came to North Carolina State

04:45.066 --> 05:02.422
for a Ph.D. in nuclear physics on my own, just 
coming back from a study leave and getting a Ph.D.

04:45.066 --> 05:02.422
in physics. And it just so happened before I left 
for this newer education, Some people approached

05:09.198 --> 05:21.509
me from the Atomic Energy establishment in Egypt 
and asked me if I would participate with them in the

05:09.198 --> 05:21.509
development of a nuclear power program for Egypt. 
And when I mentioned that I was on my way to the

05:21.529 --> 05:33.259
States to get more education in nuclear physics, 
just to happen that way, they offered an

05:21.529 --> 05:33.259
alternative. They offered me the alternative of 
going to the Soviet Union. They sent me to the

05:37.142 --> 05:38.884
Soviet Union. to get my nuclear engineering 
education there, and that they'd send me to

05:39.691 --> 05:45.119
England. And they did. So I went to the reactor 
schools, and one was in Moscow called the

05:46.521 --> 05:55.054
Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy. And then 
later on, I went to the Harvard Reactor School in

05:56.215 --> 06:02.745
England, Atomic Energy Establishment of 
Harvard. At the time, there were no nuclear

06:05.071 --> 06:11.239
engineering departments in universities or 
such. The only nuclear education you'd get would

06:11.459 --> 06:17.827
be if you were a mechanical or electrical engineer 
or a physicist maybe. You can come to the States and

06:18.528 --> 06:26.758
go to one of the five national labs, Argonne 
National Lab and Oak Ridge. or go to England to

06:27.262 --> 06:33.189
Harvard, as they did, and go to the Soviet Union to . 
So there were no departments at the time. There

06:35.551 --> 06:38.414
were no degrees in nuclear engineering. So that's 
how I got involved in that. I came back from all

06:41.678 --> 06:57.235
these

06:41.678 --> 06:57.235
educational missions, and I did take part with 
them in the planning of the first nuclear power

06:41.678 --> 06:57.235
plants and nuclear desalination versions. in 
Egypt. At the time, if your people would remember,

07:00.883 --> 07:03.387
you would not. Eisenhower had a plan called the 
Eisenhower Plan in which he suggested to build a

07:04.188 --> 07:21.095
large complex of nuclear power in the Sinai Desert 
and have a joint operation of it by Egypt and

07:04.188 --> 07:21.095
Israel. It was one way of getting Egypt and Israel 
to have peace. is for Eisenhower to offer that

07:25.227 --> 07:45.091
America would build a nuclear power plant that 
would use nuclear energy to produce electrical

07:25.227 --> 07:45.091
power and enough heat to desalt seawater and use it 
for irrigation for the Sinai Desert. And

07:45.111 --> 07:54.643
politically, the Eisenhower plan would not fly, 
but there was this kind of idea. And in the

07:57.572 --> 08:04.541
meantime, the Egyptian government did proceed 
with its own plans of getting its own nuclear power

07:57.572 --> 08:04.541
plants and what have you. And they went to the 
international market with Germany and the States

08:05.803 --> 08:12.892
and England and France. And I took part in that, a 
good part of that, until 1968.

08:24.728 --> 08:35.801
What major accomplishments have electrical 
engineers in the past 25 years

08:24.728 --> 08:35.801
come up with? Major accomplishments? The major 
accomplishments that the WES came up with

08:37.303 --> 08:51.900
have changed the face of the era, in my opinion.

08:52.083 --> 09:00.293
produced a civilization that was never surpassed 
in the whole human history in the last few decades.

09:01.255 --> 09:16.774
Solid state electronics and the new technologies 
we see and the control system that made you control

09:01.255 --> 09:16.774
all these missiles and all these spaceships and 
what have you. marvelous job in changing the way

09:18.577 --> 09:22.462
that everybody lives. Now you see the transistor 
radios in any, all the corners of the air, in

09:23.484 --> 09:31.976
deserts, right? Totally isolated places, people 
are having radio recorders and radios.

09:41.849 --> 09:48.178
So I think the computer era also has ushered in the 
last 20 years and in no time at all is going to

09:49.458 --> 09:53.584
permeate everybody's life. So I think their 
contribution is really fascinating in the last

09:56.027 --> 10:02.156
few years. What new fields and discoveries have 
you seen open up in the past 25 years in

10:03.698 --> 10:12.531
electro-engineering?

10:12.551 --> 10:17.338
Well, the Second World War, when I came to the 
States, I went to the University of Texas in

10:18.382 --> 10:21.626
Austin. Someone suggested in 1950 that I work on 
relays, solid-state relays, rather than

10:21.646 --> 10:36.726
electromagnetic relays for my dissertation. And 
I said, what's that? So they brought me some

10:40.691 --> 10:46.498
declassified information, two, three volumes, 
vehicles from the Navy, it was about transistors.

10:54.399 --> 10:55.180
They were not in books. They were not taught. They 
were just coming out in classified material.

11:02.029 --> 11:07.215
I think that was ushering the whole thing, the 
whole era that we are in today. It was the post-war

11:07.235 --> 11:16.587
period and the transistors and the like.

11:17.798 --> 11:25.108
did not, for some reason or another, I was not 
really fascinated by the idea of going to

11:17.798 --> 11:25.108
electronics and all this at the time. So I did not 
really pursue this any further. And then at the

11:28.192 --> 11:35.501
time, we were also hearing about these first 
generation computers. We were just talking about

11:35.521 --> 11:39.567
new names and what they do and this kind of thing. So 
I think that part, the early 50s, very early 50s,

11:40.548 --> 11:46.776
51, 52, 53, Again, one of the declassified areas, I 
mean, the control system of business. When I was

11:55.782 --> 12:04.370
going to school in the early 50s, there were two 
books in the control field, two. One was by

12:04.390 --> 12:12.057
Chestnut and Meyer

12:04.390 --> 12:12.057
from GE, and the other was Brown and Camp. Now there 
are hundreds of them, and the theory has Again,

12:17.266 --> 12:28.101
most of that work probably was classified in the 45 
and 44 era, you see, position control and gun

12:17.266 --> 12:28.101
positioning and the like, you see, this kind of 
thing was. So I think that that period, the early

12:28.923 --> 12:46.227
50s, that saw the transistors coming out and saw 
computers coming out, control theory

12:28.923 --> 12:46.227
pursued very actively in research, this kind of 
thing. was a very, very important period for the

12:47.303 --> 12:51.707
change. The other change that I had just missed 
would be in the early 30s, you see, where many of the

12:51.727 --> 13:03.297
accomplishments in my own area, in the power 
systems area, were made by people. Somehow in the

13:04.257 --> 13:16.568
late 20s and early 30s, there was a lot of work done, 
and the result of it is what we have to really today,

13:04.257 --> 13:16.568
what we have added mostly is... some kind of a 
sophisticated formulation of problems and

13:17.071 --> 13:24.980
solutions by computer business, computer 
methods, you see. But most of the ideas, the

13:25.440 --> 13:36.332
concepts, the attacks, the approaches to things, 
you see, were in the persistent area, were

13:25.440 --> 13:36.332
formulated there with . OK. How did the 
switchover, say, from vacuum tubes to

13:36.352 --> 13:45.762
solid-state electronics affect electrical 
engineering as a profession?

13:48.070 --> 14:12.660
we just finished talking about that i think it's uh

13:48.070 --> 14:12.660
it just opened whole new horizons as you see and 
then when when jack kilby and his work and these

13:48.070 --> 14:12.660
integrated circuits and what have you then you 
have calculators in your hand i i bought a hp 45 six

13:48.070 --> 14:12.660
years ago for 400 bucks Today I have a 41 CV for 200. 
Have you seen any new discoveries? Have there been

14:22.239 --> 14:24.342
any in, say, the past 20 years?

14:27.386 --> 14:28.768
Discoveries in what? In electrical engineering.

14:33.314 --> 14:40.043
I don't know exactly what you mean by discoveries, 
but I'm, again, pointing at the solid-state

14:33.314 --> 14:40.043
electronics area. And... I guess they have these 
cars every day. They just do things every day. In

14:49.435 --> 14:54.161
1967, Dr. Jones became the head of the electrical 
engineering department at A&M. You came to A&M in

14:54.862 --> 14:59.548
1968 at a time when the department really began to 
expand. What were your reasons for coming here? I

15:03.613 --> 15:12.364
came here by accident.

15:14.200 --> 15:37.012
At the time, in 1968, I had

15:14.200 --> 15:37.012
an offer from the United Nations to work as an 
advisor, as the advisor to the government of

15:14.200 --> 15:37.012
Indonesia for system development, the United 
Nations at the time. They still do. They had a

15:39.135 --> 15:43.802
program called the Technical Assistance Program 
And we had a roster of experts from all over the

15:44.812 --> 15:49.798
world in all areas. And whenever a country needed 
technical assistance, then the United Nations

15:51.060 --> 16:03.737
would pick one of the experts on the roster and 
suggest him to the government, and he would serve

15:51.060 --> 16:03.737
with them. So at the time, I did have

16:04.698 --> 16:14.751
an appointment from the United Nations for 
assistance with government. And I was in this

16:15.473 --> 16:19.778
country at the time. And I had talked to Mr. 
Dennison. I didn't know Jones. I knew some of the

16:27.727 --> 16:29.389
parties. I finished in Austin, so I'm always 
familiar with the area here. And at the time, my two

16:34.295 --> 16:37.999
sons, one was 10 and the other was 8. And the idea 
of... of settling down some at this age for them to

16:43.368 --> 16:57.965
go to school and get

16:43.368 --> 16:57.965
educated and raised about 100 miles from her 
grandparents and family. My wife is a Texan, and

16:58.186 --> 17:13.003
her family, they all live in Correale County 
Corporate School in that area, which is 100 miles

16:58.186 --> 17:13.003
from here, 125 miles from here. A decision that I 
just made at the time, you know, because it sounded

17:13.270 --> 17:23.422
to be maybe best for the family, this kind of thing. 
Dr. Abe, you've participated in the Electric

17:23.442 --> 17:29.148
Power Research Institute program at A&M since you 
first arrived. Could you tell us about that

17:29.568 --> 17:30.710
program? Yeah, the Electric Power Institute, as 
you probably know, is an organization within the

17:32.252 --> 17:41.522
EE department. which is supported by the Texas 
utilities.

17:47.675 --> 17:55.747
It has been supported since 1966 by 12 Texas 
utilities until recently. One of them dropped

17:55.827 --> 17:58.171
out, so we have 11 now. And they pay money annually. 
Each utility pays its share annually. And the

18:08.346 --> 18:11.070
purpose is to encourage research in the power 
systems area that will give results that will be

18:11.894 --> 18:21.825
useful to the utilities, number one. Number two is 
that they would like to encourage students to

18:21.885 --> 18:34.279
enroll in the power systems courses and get into 
the power system area. In other words, they'd like

18:34.519 --> 18:40.686
for us to prepare people that they can hire to fill 
their positions. So they are interested in

18:41.965 --> 18:58.567
education, in power system education, and in 
power system research that has practical value,

18:41.965 --> 18:58.567
not academic or not just that for the purpose of 
publishing. They just want something useful that

18:58.607 --> 19:02.593
they can use and people can use. What are some of the 
companies that participate in this program? Oh,

19:05.617 --> 19:11.044
they all do, from Houston Library of Power and 
Dallas Texas Utilities, Central Power and Light,

19:11.868 --> 19:17.517
all the Texas Utilities, the 12 of them. Started 
there. What changes have you seen in that program

19:21.202 --> 19:25.008
since you've been here? The EPI program? Yeah. 
Which program? The Electric Power Institute

19:29.215 --> 19:33.020
program. When we started, really, in 66, just 
before I came, it was... Professor Dennison, he's

19:40.893 --> 19:49.441
retired now, he retired this year, John S. 
Dennison, was here, and I think he was the only one

19:40.893 --> 19:49.441
in there. He started the program there. And then 
apparently at the same time, or slightly after

19:51.603 --> 19:59.430
that, Mr. Patton was hired. He didn't have a degree 
then. He got his PhD here later on in 1974. But he was

20:05.435 --> 20:06.216
hired. He had his master's from Pittsburgh, and he 
was hired here. And then I came in 68. So there was a

20:12.705 --> 20:19.412
few of us where we were deemed as a group at the time. 
Over the years, we stayed like this until, I'd say,

20:19.613 --> 20:28.823
75, 74, yeah, something like that. And then we 
started hiring more people. So today, we have, I

20:34.849 --> 20:38.473
mean, we just people. We have Dr. Hassani and Dr. 
Singh and Dr. Russell and Dr. Wang has been hired

20:40.157 --> 20:52.033
recently. He's a mathematician and mathematics 
and systems man, but he works in the nuclear

20:52.093 --> 20:57.661
systems area. And Dr. Chenoweth and myself. We 
have six feet. So instead of two or three, now we're

21:03.209 --> 21:05.672
six. The areas of interest also have changed now. 
We do have, before we hired new people, we were

21:10.398 --> 21:36.388
interested mostly in power system reliability, 
which is the application of probability methods

21:10.398 --> 21:36.388
to calculate indices to tell me whether this 
design is reliable or not, will it perform the way I

21:10.398 --> 21:36.388
want it or not, this kind of thing. uh russell and 
aksani and all of these we have new areas of

21:36.841 --> 22:05.430
interest one of them is

21:36.841 --> 22:05.430
i go to the dc power electronics in general it's a 
power conditioning you know power electronics

21:36.841 --> 22:05.430
which is a new area to us mr aksani works in there and 
then we have

22:07.655 --> 22:16.548
Russell was interested in automation and 
distribution system automation and using the

22:07.655 --> 22:16.548
microcomputers and the like. So we did expand in 
size and interest. Can you give us some examples of

22:22.456 --> 22:30.408
what other researchers in the electrical 
engineering department have accomplished at

22:22.456 --> 22:30.408
A&M? The department?

22:39.143 --> 22:45.851
would not really be, I won't be able really to tell 
you much about the others. We do have some, an

22:45.871 --> 22:58.146
institute, we have that solar state electronics 
institute upstairs, Dr. Parker handles that, and

22:45.871 --> 22:58.146
he should be able to tell you more about it. In the 
control area, You see me, I don't know, I mean, you

23:06.548 --> 23:10.172
see me hesitate a little bit here. I don't know how 
much you're going to place on this interview, but

23:12.234 --> 23:29.510
you see, the thing that makes me hesitate is that we 
had such an experience, you know, recent in the

23:12.234 --> 23:29.510
last few years, you know. Some people are not here 
all together. We lost quite a few of our faculty, if

23:33.374 --> 23:36.437
you remember. Last year we lost 30% of our faculty 
within a year. So I would not be able to enumerate

23:42.881 --> 23:52.155
what these people have been doing or why they left 
or anything like that. But we had some bad

23:53.337 --> 23:58.885
experiences, I would say. And I hope you don't 
spread that around. In the mid-60s, very little

24:03.147 --> 24:08.592
money was allotted to research in electrical 
engineering at A&M. Today, about $1.4 million is

24:08.672 --> 24:12.636
allotted to research. What effect has this 
increase in spending on projects had on the

24:12.656 --> 24:18.342
department? You see, in the late 60s, the whole 
department was 25. The personnel were 25 people,

24:25.569 --> 24:31.315
faculty and staff. Two years ago, we reached our 
faculty, the research and teaching faculty was 65

24:32.493 --> 24:40.642
people.

24:44.106 --> 24:48.971
And the research was quite a bit of the time they 
spent. Many of them were paid of that money you're

24:49.191 --> 24:53.836
talking about. So we did grow, and the money that we 
had meant growth, like you see there. and then uh we

25:02.159 --> 25:32.014
lost some of these we lost 20 or something

25:02.159 --> 25:32.014
but they we did grow that and we had more facilities 
built that uh so state electronics lab i'm telling

25:02.159 --> 25:32.014
you about their floors was started with doctors 
kip porter the man who is now heading the tees he

25:02.159 --> 25:32.014
came here at the same time i came I think it has 
expanded quite a bit. It does have a good status. I

25:38.610 --> 25:39.591
talk to people about it.

25:42.676 --> 25:49.826
In 1975, you went on leave for two years as 
professor and head of the new Department of

25:42.676 --> 25:49.826
Electrical Engineering at the University of 
Kuwait. Can you tell us what differences in

25:50.787 --> 25:57.197
engineering you saw there as compared to here? 
Well, the University of Kuwait did not have a

26:01.964 --> 26:05.568
college of engineering altogether. So in 1975, in 
August 1975, I walked in the University of Kuwait,

26:06.029 --> 26:26.795
and I was given the keys to a new building where 
engineering was supposed to be established.

26:26.955 --> 26:30.199
So I was the first one who walked in the building. in 
1975 and at the time they started a mechanical

26:30.787 --> 26:58.330
electrical engineering department and 
mechanical union department civil engineering

26:30.787 --> 26:58.330
and chemical engineering only four departments 
and it so happened that one the man who was in charge

26:30.787 --> 26:58.330
of mechanical engineering who was head then 
walked in with me right after i did was also a

26:58.917 --> 27:02.180
professor here. And we were entrusted, of course, 
with the task of designing the curriculum,

27:02.201 --> 27:22.582
specifying and establishing the labs,

27:02.201 --> 27:22.582
the library, and staff. It was a new college 
altogether. You see, I got there on the 23rd of

27:24.124 --> 27:27.928
August, 1975. the 15th of september we had 
students enrolled you see for the first year so the

27:28.415 --> 27:54.118
the curriculum design and lab facilities and this 
faculty that we hired were highly influenced by

27:28.415 --> 27:54.118
the by the system we have here of course as you 
suspect when i i i They drove my observations here

27:54.571 --> 28:02.339
and my experience here. In other words, you would 
say that their curriculum for electrical

28:02.560 --> 28:09.307
engineering is very similar to ours. It would be. I 
suspect that. And then the faculty, the platform

28:13.351 --> 28:22.641
staff, I had to sit all of that. I was supposed to be 
there for a year. So after the one year was over,

28:25.182 --> 28:29.927
they did ask the university to leave me there 
another year. So the plan for everything, the plan

28:31.008 --> 28:51.051
for the staffing, what faculty members should be 
hired when as we go, and which labs should be bought

28:31.008 --> 28:51.051
and constructed and when as we go, all this I had to 
do in the two years. And I did draw quite a bit on the

28:54.562 --> 29:03.273
One of the purposes of my mission there really was 
to establish some kind of a sister-ship

28:54.562 --> 29:03.273
relationship between the two universities. We 
need that. If we have a contact in Kuwait, like the

29:06.036 --> 29:15.287
University of Kuwait, that has a relationship 
with an exchange of professors, exchange of what

29:06.036 --> 29:15.287
have you, I think we all gain this. When you 
returned to A&M, a trend in enrollment had

29:16.482 --> 29:20.747
started. There were about 110 seniors in the 
electrical engineering department in 1979. By

29:26.354 --> 29:28.677
1982, that figure had more than doubled. What has 
been the impact of this?

29:36.686 --> 29:45.797
The increase in enrollment, really, is 
phenomenal, as we all know.

29:48.157 --> 30:02.155
would not really completely condone

29:48.157 --> 30:02.155
measures of restricting enrollment as such. It 
has to be... This is a state institution, as far as

30:05.239 --> 30:07.362
I'm concerned. This is my own opinion. It's a state 
institution. It's a rich state institution. It's

30:14.091 --> 30:16.774
not a poor institution. And it's supposed to be 
training

30:18.599 --> 30:37.625
sons and daughters of the state of Texas and what 
have you, and I just can't see a place like this

30:18.599 --> 30:37.625
restricting enrollment by the means that they are 
doing it. But it was a fact, and we had to face it,

30:37.645 --> 30:44.735
that we have many people walking in and we did not 
have enough faculty. This is the There was some

30:47.742 --> 30:55.551
talk about not enough space to schedule our 
classroom meetings and what have you. There was

30:55.672 --> 31:01.899
some talk like this, and this is why the next 
building was built. But I think it is highly

31:01.919 --> 31:17.378
important that we try to hire good faculty, and not 
only hire them, be able to retain I mean, we should

31:18.708 --> 31:28.597
have good working conditions and good working 
relationships so that we can retain people. And we

31:28.617 --> 31:33.601
can have them work. So devotion rather than being

31:34.282 --> 31:43.390
disappointed, mistreated, what have you. We have 
to have good working conditions so that we can

31:44.091 --> 31:47.854
retain good faculty. You're right about it. Now, 
what happened when they increased? If you see our

31:53.835 --> 31:59.800
classes now, I teach 338 very often. And we have all 
the juniors at any time. So it's 130 people or 125,

32:03.503 --> 32:10.229
this kind of range. When this happened, the 
enrollment increase, I did suggest that we put

32:10.289 --> 32:16.254
them all in the same room. And one professor would 
teach them. We're doing this with 338, and we're

32:18.682 --> 32:29.933
doing it with some of the non-EE major courses, the 
service courses we give to the others. We group

32:30.613 --> 32:34.617
them in the auditorium down there. This is a system 
that is new to the United States. In the States,

32:40.242 --> 32:45.027
traditionally, we've had small classes and 
personal contacts between the teacher and the

32:45.462 --> 32:48.387
student. We always had a high ratio.

32:55.217 --> 33:03.450
But in Europe it has been the mode of operation for 
decades and for maybe some universities for a

32:55.217 --> 33:03.450
thousand years. There is a lecture room and anyone 
can walk in and can have a thousand people in it. And

33:10.942 --> 33:12.685
you have a professor there at the very end of it, 
talking, and everybody's gaining learning

33:12.867 --> 33:20.155
knowledge, you see, from there. So it's a new kind 
of thing for us, really, but it's a very workable

33:20.936 --> 33:26.822
thing. The only thing with it that people should 
realize is that the professor in Europe who gives

33:26.842 --> 33:36.072
that lecture is not anyone. You see what I mean? I 
mean, if I'm going to have an auditorium with a

33:39.395 --> 33:52.454
thousand people in it and someone's going to talk 
about thermodynamics or electrical circuits, he

33:39.395 --> 33:52.454
must be someone who has done it over years. He knows 
what he's talking about. He has written it. He has

33:56.480 --> 33:58.083
rehearsed it. He has videotaped it. This caliber 
of man is what you need for this kind of lecture. It

34:06.535 --> 34:08.558
cannot work with the idea... with the attitude of 
what a fool can do and any other fool can't. Just go

34:12.960 --> 34:16.104
in and teach them the darn thing. So we are in the 
process of meeting large classes, elections for

34:16.265 --> 34:23.674
large classes. And it has its pros, it has its cons, 
but it is one way of facing the increased

34:24.916 --> 34:33.467
enrollment. You can do that. You can do that. If 
your professors would get off their butts, you

34:35.875 --> 34:41.120
see, I mean it. And do not hate teaching and do not 
hide behind research. They do nothing, you see.

34:48.488 --> 34:51.151
Some of them just pretend to do research and they 
don't. Or whatever they do is garbage, which is

34:52.032 --> 34:54.695
very common. This is very, very common, you see. 
And many people try to get out of teaching any way

34:57.077 --> 35:02.163
they can, you see. It happens. Why? I really 
believe that we have a lack in the, what would you

35:05.103 --> 35:13.736
call that? A lack of, I hate to say it, devotion. You 
see, what happens to me, the way I think about it,

35:21.026 --> 35:32.443
the way I've seen it, the way I think about it, is 
that there are several levels of devotion, okay? I

35:33.183 --> 35:38.888
guess the first one is that of the monks in a 
monastery. They have nothing but worship. They do

35:40.070 --> 35:42.812
nothing but worship. It is my belief, my 
conviction, that the university professors come

35:42.832 --> 35:49.579
next. Are we really that devoted as professors in 
this university? This is very important. If we are

35:55.965 --> 35:59.628
not, why are we not that devoted? What is 
distracting me from my research and my students. I

36:04.570 --> 36:11.497
worry because there is no fairness here or 
whatever is there. What is it? We have to give

36:13.379 --> 36:21.808
people a very good working condition so that they 
can come next to the monastery and devotion.

36:23.189 --> 36:28.975
How has the quality of students changed in the past 
16 years?

36:30.440 --> 36:53.146
Somehow, I don't want to be critical of the new 
generation, but somehow they were, in the past, in

36:30.440 --> 36:53.146
all the time, they were better prepared, a little 
bit.

36:53.186 --> 36:59.333
But it is also very fortunate that our own students 
now are just as serious as the old ones. I mean, I do

37:00.612 --> 37:08.661
not see any difference between the, I don't want to 
say discipline, but discipline. In the classroom

37:08.841 --> 37:15.548
here and 16 years ago, I see them very polite, very 
serious. They come to class and they listen and

37:15.568 --> 37:21.314
they're respectful and the what have you. But 
somehow the high school education might have

37:21.334 --> 37:26.219
changed a little bit. I don't know. Maybe there are 
too many things, many, many new things, you know,

37:26.920 --> 37:29.843
that that interferes with their drilling and 
training and this kind of things. Maybe more

37:38.511 --> 37:44.439
sports, more travels, more TV, whatever. Somehow 
there's a little bit of a change. The way I see it,

37:48.244 --> 37:50.487
it's not really that major. And I've always 
thought that repetition is good. and a review is

37:56.047 --> 37:59.611
good no matter how good you are at it. I do not at all 
object or refrain from, in any class, no matter how

37:59.812 --> 38:11.085
high a level they did, of just going back to basics 
for a few minutes. There's nothing wrong with

38:11.125 --> 38:13.108
that. But somehow I think the kids are different in 
this way. They probably are broader in

38:15.531 --> 38:22.139
culture and education than before. But I wouldn't 
say it's a very measured choice. And this school,

38:26.118 --> 38:30.866
we have been reporting that they are really 
serious about their studies. How has electrical

38:32.949 --> 38:40.762
engineering curriculum improved over the last 16 
years in the department?

38:42.044 --> 38:51.940
We, in 77, when I came back from Kuwait, I did 
suggest to Dr. Jones at the time, we had trouble, as

38:42.044 --> 38:51.940
I could feel, Well, let me put it this way. I had a son 
at the time who was going to electrical

38:54.047 --> 38:59.377
engineering here. So he finished in 1980, AA. My 
second son, I have two boys. My second son finished

39:04.185 --> 39:06.910
last year, AA. So my concern with this department 
was not only because I worked here. My own kids were

39:12.720 --> 39:15.345
educated here. So I didn't show concern at the time 
to Dr. Jones as a parent and as a colleague that

39:16.287 --> 39:27.200
things are not going well in the way the kids are 
being taught here. And I suggested to him that we

39:28.182 --> 39:41.518
establish a curriculum committee that will look 
closely at all the syllabi of the courses and the

39:28.182 --> 39:41.518
courses themselves, are they up to date or not. 
Should we be updated? Should we introduce new

39:43.966 --> 39:46.289
courses or not? Should we change the core course 
requirements, drop one and add one, or what have

39:46.750 --> 39:52.778
you? So we did establish a varying committee that 
year, and we still have one now. I chaired it for two

39:58.005 --> 39:59.948
years then. And yeah, we changed. We introduced 
new courses continuously. And we have changed,

40:07.958 --> 40:13.325
and we're changing now to the core requirements. 
So the curriculum is being dynamic. It's being

40:15.528 --> 40:17.410
updated all the time. It's being looked at. Okay. 
How would you rank electrical engineering at A&M

40:21.315 --> 40:25.680
with other schools? Again, what do you rank them 
by? Top 20, top 30, top 10? What do you mean by

40:31.728 --> 40:33.090
ranking? Yeah, how you feel that we compare to the 
other schools. You see, we were compared last

40:39.228 --> 40:52.681
year, two years ago, nationally,

40:39.228 --> 40:52.681
our graduate program, our department, and they 
put us at 69 out of 99.

40:56.965 --> 41:01.509
But that survey was not fair. I mean, I know it was 
biased because we were not handled correctly. I

41:05.093 --> 41:07.395
mean, many, many, not only us. But many other 
schools, the data about them was not correct. It

41:10.564 --> 41:12.266
was not complete. And I would say that we are better 
than 69 out of 99. Where do you think that we should

41:15.590 --> 41:20.356
go on? I would say that knowing the school that I 
have in touch with, my colleagues from other

41:20.376 --> 41:30.447
schools in Purdue and Iowa State and Berkeley and 
what have you, I would say that we would be in the top

41:32.502 --> 41:37.868
40.

41:38.910 --> 41:47.881
Has

41:38.910 --> 41:47.881
the electrical engineering department at A&M had 
any defense contracts since you've been here?

41:50.023 --> 41:52.846
There's some work for the Air Force that they've 
been doing all the time. Do you know what for? No.

41:59.097 --> 42:05.946
When did students here first start designing 
integrated circuits?

42:05.966 --> 42:07.448
I would not be able to tell you that either.

42:14.959 --> 42:16.181
I would not tell you.

42:18.844 --> 42:28.918
What other changes of any kind have you seen in the 
electrical

42:18.844 --> 42:28.918
engineering department? Changes that were very 
upsetting to me, and I hope that we get over them,

42:29.455 --> 42:38.108
are still going on today. See, if you look at us, we 
are a department that lost one-third of its

42:39.350 --> 42:46.400
faculty last year. The department head that we 
had, Mr. Jones, has been terminated. We have an

42:52.970 --> 42:56.796
interim head, and we're looking for a head. So 
we're looking for a department head, and we're

42:57.991 --> 43:03.277
looking for a third of our faculty. I think this is a 
very sad situation, and I hope we get over it very

43:03.297 --> 43:07.841
soon. Otherwise, we're going to be in trouble for 
years to come. What do you think was the cause for

43:10.164 --> 43:13.147
the loss of faculty? The treatment, the working 
conditions, the administration. There was no

43:18.533 --> 43:19.474
leadership. There was no leadership. There was 
arbitrary decisions. I mean, people cannot be

43:24.046 --> 43:28.311
arbitrarily promoted and paid, you see. I mean, I 
can't promote you because I like you and I give you

43:29.032 --> 43:35.659
10% raise and I don't give you anything on no basis. 
See, people do not feel secure. And when you're

43:38.062 --> 43:40.345
young, you know, you just run. You run fast when 
you're in

43:41.026 --> 43:47.173
a situation like that. Okay. Is there anything 
else at all that you'd like to say? i would like to

43:53.071 --> 44:19.416
say that this is the alma mater of my two sons my two 
sons my two boys i have a very deep rooted interest

43:53.071 --> 44:19.416
in it okay and until i retire if i'm still here i am 
going to do my best and i really hope that it does

43:53.071 --> 44:19.416
come back revive after what we have been in we are we 
are not we're coming from a very sad situation that

44:20.358 --> 44:48.694
many of the students are not aware of if you 
remember last year you see mr page was changed and

44:20.358 --> 44:48.694
mr john was changed you know we lost five 
department heads of state this is what we have

44:20.358 --> 44:48.694
today you don't know about it but this one is i think 
this college deserves a much better

44:20.358 --> 44:48.694
administration a much better planning and a much 
better future It's a rich college. It has a lot of

44:51.349 --> 44:53.132
devoted kids in it. The kids are serious kids, 
polite and serious. I can see any reason why we

44:58.642 --> 45:07.618
cannot really improve our status nationally and 
keep our reputation and improve it. Well, thank

45:08.559 --> 45:10.623
you for your time. You bet.
