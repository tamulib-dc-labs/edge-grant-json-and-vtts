WEBVTT

00:03.085 --> 00:07.010
Looking at anything that had to do with the ocean. 
Well, you know, I've been a dabbler most of my life,

00:09.633 --> 00:14.780
I guess. And I guess that's why I'll need to live two 
or three lifetimes to do all the things that I'd

00:16.522 --> 00:23.250
like to do. But one of the many things that I did as an 
undergraduate was to work in a fish hatchery. And

00:33.241 --> 00:40.490
I'd kind of had an interest in development, you 
know, in biological development. And one could

00:41.070 --> 00:51.863
most easily visualize

00:41.070 --> 00:51.863
biological development with fish, eggs, and that 
sort of thing. And so that was a real interesting

00:52.644 --> 00:56.228
area of endeavor for me. What all this means is that 
I'd had experience with fish hatchery work, which

00:56.984 --> 01:11.406
means that I had experience with fish, which leads 
to the fact that I thought that there might be some

00:56.984 --> 01:11.406
diseases in fish that would be interesting. And so 
I saw Leland after the meeting and I said, yeah, I

01:12.748 --> 01:21.661
think I might have an idea on that. He said, he first 
said, Well, Don, I believe your plate's full. He

01:31.586 --> 01:35.516
said, you probably ought to get back to EIA. You've 
done this pig thing.

01:41.892 --> 01:45.300
Do whatever you want to, but I really don't, he 
said, I don't see where. So I said, well, it's

01:47.744 --> 01:50.827
something I'm kind of interested in. So being the 
kind of person he was, he just let me go home and do

01:50.847 --> 01:55.212
it. So I wrote a project, put together a project. 
And then I got to thinking about it. You know, the

02:02.639 --> 02:10.968
veterinary profession has sort of dropped the 
ball on swine, on the swine industry.

02:13.551 --> 02:14.832
I think this might be an area that the veterinary 
profession ought to be involved in. So then I got to

02:21.475 --> 02:25.943
talking it up among some of the other people in some 
of the other departments. And I thought it might

02:25.963 --> 02:33.195
strengthen the proposal if I got other people in 
other departments involved in it. Well, most of

02:33.215 --> 02:35.880
them said, yeah, Louis, put my name on there. 
That's all right. I'll do that. So to kind of make a

02:37.182 --> 02:41.089
long story short, I put together a proposal. that 
involved all the major departments of the

02:41.677 --> 02:49.626
college, and submitted it to the Sea Grant people. 
Well, John wore many hats, and he was in charge of

02:51.288 --> 03:00.019
the Sea Grant operation. Now, he may not even 
remember me personally. I don't know whether he

03:02.662 --> 03:03.823
does or not. But I put this proposal together and 
submitted it to him, And he sent it to the people,

03:11.410 --> 03:21.063
you know, the NOAA people, and that was something 
they really were interested in. In fact, they got

03:21.524 --> 03:26.751
very interested in it and gave it and funded it at a 
fairly high level. Now, let's see.

03:31.398 --> 03:36.265
Seems like that was around $250,000 or $300,000 
that they funded. That's a large amount for Sea

03:36.285 --> 03:38.988
Grant even today. Mm-hmm. Most of those type of 
things, you get $30,000 to $40,000 and that's

03:40.604 --> 03:46.631
about all. And I think that's about all they do now. 
Well, I suggested that aquaculture was really the

03:50.795 --> 03:56.021
wave of the future. And I still think it is. But 
unfortunately, it hadn't developed to the extent

04:00.246 --> 04:08.856
that I think it could have or should have. At any 
rate, So that was my next thing to get involved in

04:10.962 --> 04:14.866
aquatic research. And

04:16.909 --> 04:20.573
let's see. I

04:20.593 --> 04:33.747
kind of had an interest in, well, first of all, 
Archie and Leland and myself, thought that a good

04:35.600 --> 04:43.648
source of specimens and potential interest would 
be the Parks and Wildlife Department in Austin. So

04:45.710 --> 04:56.621
they said, well, why don't you call, ask me, why 
don't you call, call some people in Austin and see

04:45.710 --> 04:56.621
if they'd be interested in collaborating with us. 
I've forgotten the name of the individual with

04:56.641 --> 05:03.868
whom I talked at that time and I said, you know, I was 
visiting with them on the phone and I said, We'd

05:06.042 --> 05:14.991
like to run with the College of Veterinary 
Medicine and we're kind of interested in looking

05:06.042 --> 05:14.991
into the potential disease problems that fish may 
have. And this is the part of the state that is

05:15.912 --> 05:23.340
responsible for the state fish hatcheries and so 
forth. And the person that I was talking to was, I

05:25.022 --> 05:33.130
don't remember his official title, but he was in 
charge of those fisheries and And I didn't know it

05:34.443 --> 05:45.096
at the time, but they had been kind of under the gun 
from the legislature as far as problems that were

05:34.443 --> 05:45.096
happening in the hatcheries. But when I suggested 
that fish may have some diseases, and that may be

05:45.477 --> 06:00.996
part of the problems that they're having, boy, he 
really became very defensive. And he said, fish

06:01.056 --> 06:02.998
don't have diseases.

06:05.746 --> 06:08.790
And I talked with him for a little bit. I said, you 
gotta be kidding. He said, no, we don't have any.

06:12.414 --> 06:18.802
See, the poor guy had apparently been under the gun 
from his funding sources because of the problems

06:12.414 --> 06:18.802
that he was having. But at any rate, he wasn't 
wanting to collaborate with us. He wasn't wanting

06:22.547 --> 06:29.475
to uncover any problems with their hatchery 
systems. And so we, but we still did have the Sea

06:30.198 --> 06:41.949
Grant people and then we got to working real 
closely with the federal agency in Galveston. And

06:41.969 --> 06:55.661
at that time, they were trying to develop shrimp 
culture and were having some problems and some of

06:41.969 --> 06:55.661
the problems that they were having were due to a 
particular bacterium, Vibrio. The name doesn't

06:56.722 --> 06:59.665
make much difference, but it's a bacterium. And 
also about that time,

07:01.096 --> 07:22.665
the college felt like that, and I concurred, felt 
like that it would be good if we had a veterinarian,

07:01.096 --> 07:22.665
a practicing practitioner who had some 
experience with fish diseases. And so they did

07:23.843 --> 07:33.494
find someone that had had some experience with him 
and brought him in and gave him a pretty good salary

07:23.843 --> 07:33.494
and that sort of thing. He was an individual that 
had some, he just wasn't real easy to get along

07:33.614 --> 07:43.345
with, with most people. And I guess that's putting 
it kind of mildly, including Al Price. He and Al

07:51.029 --> 07:52.311
didn't get along. He and another guy, Fred Maurer, 
had come on board at that time, who was real Army

07:52.652 --> 08:02.589
research-oriented. That's M-A-U-R-E-R. That's 
correct. And he and Fred had numerous knockdowns.

08:11.084 --> 08:14.470
I mean, they really, this fellow had a lot of 
problems. He and, he just, He was kind of like a

08:17.472 --> 08:21.520
rebellious adolescent in many respects. I won't 
mention his name because I don't want to

08:22.742 --> 08:26.129
incriminate him. Well, he's dead now, but I think 
so. But at any rate, he didn't work out. And so...

08:36.997 --> 08:48.053
while he was working on, while he was gonna assume 
the helm on the aquatic stuff, I started looking

08:36.997 --> 08:48.053
for other things to do research on. I was 
interested in working with fish, but I was also

08:49.074 --> 08:54.602
wanting to try to explore other areas. Well, when 
he left then, I felt like I had an obligation to move

08:55.904 --> 09:01.972
back to the aquatic area, and I did. And about that 
time, let's see, There was, oh, just thinking of

09:09.093 --> 09:21.346
the presidential succession, Earl Rutter, Jack 
Williams, then Vandiver. Wait, Jarvis. Yeah,

09:23.509 --> 09:30.897
well, there's another story about Jarvis and 
let's see, Earl Rutter. Well, anyway, let me tell

09:31.838 --> 09:34.821
you this brief story about Earl Rutter.

09:37.644 --> 09:39.066
I had been a graduate student here. And I had just 
become appointed on the faculty in the college,

09:41.763 --> 09:55.139
and I was walking across the campus one day. And

09:55.199 --> 10:00.766
he came to work early every morning. He came to work 
about 7.30 or so. And I was walking across the

10:03.009 --> 10:08.355
campus one day, and he said, Hello, Don, how are 
you? That blew me away. I didn't. I didn't know why

10:12.526 --> 10:18.557
he knew my name, but he apparently knew all of them. 
He made it his business to know all the faculty

10:18.877 --> 10:25.670
members by first name, and I guess that's true. 
What do you think was the perception by the

10:25.830 --> 10:29.817
veterinary faculty of Mr. Rutter? Oh, they held 
him in high regard. They held him in very high

10:33.664 --> 10:35.327
regard. And he didn't come over there and walk 
around much, did he? No, no, no. That's what I

10:39.278 --> 10:39.899
thought. No, he didn't. Now, the story of Highway 6 
going both ways, I sat in on that meeting. I was

10:50.295 --> 10:53.299
there at that meeting.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.633
Quite frankly, I kind of agreed with him. Because 
there were a lot of people that were expressing

10:57.653 --> 11:08.976
dissatisfaction over trivial issues that really 
didn't need to be, they didn't need to be. Yeah, I

11:10.458 --> 11:16.386
understand the point he was trying to make far more 
clearly now than I did then. Yeah. Because I've

11:17.107 --> 11:18.910
been on both sides of that table. I hear you. I hear 
you, yeah.

11:23.636 --> 11:27.802
But to directly answer you, I know you're, you 
know, I don't want to waste any more of your time

11:23.636 --> 11:27.802
than necessary. No, no, no. But he was held in high 
regard. Right. But I don't think, I'm not aware of

11:32.649 --> 11:38.457
anyone, maybe not even Al Price, I'm not aware, he, 
Apparently, Earl wasn't the sort of person that

11:39.061 --> 11:44.026
you could just sit down and have coffee with. Not 
very easily, no. Now, what about Jack Williams?

11:48.732 --> 11:51.575
Did you all... Oh, yeah, thought very highly of 
him. He was the kind of person that you could... In

11:54.418 --> 11:56.400
fact, well, he was another one that... I remember 
shopping in what used to be, you know,

11:58.202 --> 12:03.628
Skaggs-Opperson over there. It's not... At the 
Circle at Northgate? Yeah. And... I was shopping

12:09.352 --> 12:19.062
in there and he again called me by my first name and 
asked me how the family was and that sort of thing. I

12:20.884 --> 12:37.300
never knew why

12:20.884 --> 12:37.300
people at that level

12:20.884 --> 12:37.300
go to the trouble of knowing about people at my 
level at that time. But anyway, yeah, Jack

12:37.533 --> 12:40.918
Williams was held in real high regard. And I think 
you'll find that to be a consensus if you ask that

12:40.938 --> 12:45.824
same question to any of these other people. All 
right, now, it's during his time that George

12:46.245 --> 12:50.791
Shelton, Dr. Price retires. George Shelton 
becomes the new dean. Describe anything you

12:53.795 --> 13:02.286
recall about the search and the feelings when he 
came and how he began his task. Well, there were

13:02.407 --> 13:05.751
mixed feelings about him. I mean,

13:06.946 --> 13:19.088
it's sort of like a brotherhood was dissolved.

13:24.258 --> 13:26.442
Because everybody knew each other well. He had 
come out of a group of his contemporaries. That's

13:29.808 --> 13:31.030
correct. In fact, I guess this doesn't speak very 
well for graduate education at that time, but most

13:31.533 --> 13:51.631
of the people that held graduate degrees at that 
time were on each other's,

13:31.533 --> 13:51.631
were directing each other's. I mean, it was a real 
close brotherhood type thing. And really, I don't

13:54.514 --> 14:01.000
think, some of it had some substance, but a lot of it 
didn't have much substance to it. That's a side

14:01.199 --> 14:04.563
issue, and maybe it's not even relevant. Maybe 
it's not even important, but there's some quality

14:04.583 --> 14:11.552
issues that quality wasn't as good as it could have 
been. Did Dean Shelton make any changes? Yes.

14:15.677 --> 14:18.440
Well, slowly, but he did. He

14:18.480 --> 14:26.530
had a hard time initially.

14:28.312 --> 14:30.835
Well, quite frankly, Leland didn't like him very 
well. But he'll never say that and probably I

14:31.540 --> 14:34.984
shouldn't be saying that. But he actually, I 
think,

14:35.946 --> 14:47.320
some people thought he's kind of dull, not too 
bright really. I mean, that's what I mean is not too

14:47.761 --> 14:49.883
bright. But he soon came across as an individual 
that was pretty sly politically. Let's see, let me

14:59.418 --> 15:01.620
add an editorial note here. Okay. When the search 
was nearing its completion, I, as the chairman of

15:02.962 --> 15:15.854
the search committee, went in to Dr. Jack 
Williams, the president, and summarized for him

15:02.962 --> 15:15.854
what we had done. And I told him that we had tried to 
have a representative of every segment of the

15:17.276 --> 15:25.965
veterinary medicine public. That is, there was a 
former student and faculty and students and so

15:25.985 --> 15:29.408
forth. And that when each of the interviewees had 
come to the campus, they had had an interview

15:30.704 --> 15:42.916
session with each group, with the vet faculty, 
with the department heads, with the students, and

15:30.704 --> 15:42.916
so forth. And then that I, as chairman, went back to 
those groups and got each of them to rank all of the

15:43.697 --> 15:52.245
interviewees and had given a point. They were to 
rank them in order. And so I score. Williams sure

15:56.303 --> 16:25.045
there were two people that had were ranked highest 
and it was all their point score were almost

15:56.303 --> 16:25.045
exactly the same and one was George Shelton who was 
then the associate dean of veterinary medicine at

15:56.303 --> 16:25.045
the University of Missouri and the other was a man 
who had been the dean of veterinary medicine at

15:56.303 --> 16:25.045
Ohio State and after a year and a half or two years he 
and Ohio State had parted company angrily and

15:56.303 --> 16:25.045
apparently he could tell told them where they 
could go and what they could do when they got there I

16:25.700 --> 16:29.986
had been very much attracted by his brilliance. I 
thought he was exciting. And so when I went in to

16:32.389 --> 16:40.339
summarize the evaluations for Dr. Williams, I 
said, now this man from Ohio State will be

16:32.389 --> 16:40.339
controversial. Some of his ideas are not 
apparently that good, but some are really good and

16:40.359 --> 16:44.805
some are exciting. And that place will be jumping. 
There will be something going on all the time. I

16:50.106 --> 16:50.828
mean, it will be. And some of them may make front 
pages. He said, tell me about this other man. I

16:55.939 --> 17:01.271
said, well, Dr. Shelton will be much more quiet, 
much more reserved. There won't be any

17:01.752 --> 17:03.115
excitement. There won't be any cataclysmic 
changes, but things will just get gradually

17:03.483 --> 17:09.432
better, I think. I think he will work well with the 
public, particularly with the veterinary public

17:09.832 --> 17:17.023
and so forth. Dr. Williams quickly said, I've got 
enough damn excitement in my life, thanks to the

17:17.043 --> 17:22.511
Board of Regents. And he said, let's go with this 
man named Shelton. End of note. Well, I don't

17:28.880 --> 17:32.325
remember... I don't remember very much about the 
various people that were interviewing at that

17:32.913 --> 17:37.179
time.

17:43.007 --> 17:44.890
Shelton worked out to be fine. All right, after he 
got here, how did his deaning relate to what you

17:45.351 --> 17:54.904
were trying to do? See, we were in some turmoil at 
that time. Leland Grumbles had stepped down and

17:59.045 --> 18:04.535
Charlie Hall had taken over, the Charlie Hall 
that's in our department. And Charlie and Leland

18:06.439 --> 18:11.087
were very good friends until Charlie became 
department head and then they started having

18:11.540 --> 18:35.556
problems and part of the mix that was part of the 
same mix that you know Al Price was having problems

18:11.540 --> 18:35.556
at that time so our so the school was in sort of a 
turmoil and

18:11.540 --> 18:35.556
I'm saying things that I probably ought you know I 
would not would not want to incriminate Charlie or

18:36.076 --> 18:41.782
Leland or Al. These are just things that happen. 
These are just things that happen. I have the

18:45.565 --> 18:47.767
greatest respect for all of those people. I mean, 
they're very, people whom I admire and they're

18:49.329 --> 18:52.933
very good friends. Or, you know, in the case of Al, 
was a very good friend. But there was a lot of

18:57.938 --> 19:01.481
turmoil.

19:02.122 --> 19:04.564
And so, what I'm about to say is, George came on 
board, he was there about six months, and Charlie

19:04.966 --> 19:10.191
decided he wanted to step down. Didn't want to be 
department head anymore. So they did an extensive

19:12.974 --> 19:15.276
department head search. You may recall, I don't 
know whether you were here or whether you would

19:16.277 --> 19:34.855
have been in the loop with department head 
searches or not, but they did an extensive

19:16.277 --> 19:34.855
department head search, and apparently no one, no 
one had taken over.

19:37.214 --> 20:03.272
George came to me one day just out of the clear blue 
and said Don I need somebody to lead this

19:37.214 --> 20:03.272
department I said gee I said I haven't had any 
administrative experience he said well my back's

19:37.214 --> 20:03.272
to the wall I really need somebody to help me said if 
you if you would might said this can be an interim

19:37.214 --> 20:03.272
type thing in fact it probably should be I said Dr. 
Shelton I really I'm reluctant to do this I don't

20:04.990 --> 20:34.305
know I've never I said I've been in the laboratory 
most of my life and he said well I said Leland and and

20:04.990 --> 20:34.305
Charlie both recommended you and I'd sure 
appreciate it if you'd consider doing it so I so I

20:04.990 --> 20:34.305
did I acted in that fashion for I guess a year and a 
half Describe what it was like to be the interim

20:34.893 --> 20:39.137
department head. Scary. Scary to me. What were the 
primary worries, concerns? Well, there were a lot

20:44.982 --> 20:49.666
of things that were wrong that I felt like a true 
department head would need to correct. And I

20:51.087 --> 20:56.432
didn't know how long I was going to be there, and I 
knew that I was going to have to be moving back to,

20:51.087 --> 20:56.432
you know. So that, I'd be moving back to the, you 
know, I don't, mean I'd be moving back to the

21:04.205 --> 21:32.592
trenches to use the vernacular and I didn't want to 
do anything because I had just about everyone I

21:04.205 --> 21:32.592
felt everyone was a friend and but but many of them 
weren't doing what I felt like they should be doing

21:04.205 --> 21:32.592
and we had I mean we had problems secretarial 
problems and you know various types of problems

21:04.205 --> 21:32.592
like that and I was really afraid of that situation

21:04.205 --> 21:32.592
um So then I, you know, for about two or three 
months, I kind of really agonized over those

21:33.247 --> 21:40.918
problems. And it's probably, that's probably the 
reason why I, you know, I'm not an innate, innately

21:40.958 --> 21:49.670
good administrator because of the, because I 
don't know that I am. I don't know whether I am or

21:49.711 --> 21:50.932
not, but. What did you find for, of the realities 
you had to cope with? Okay, first of all, I had to

21:56.721 --> 21:58.503
fire a secretary. I did that. I did it and I went to 
sleep, slept fine. I had to suggest to an

22:04.600 --> 22:14.353
individual, I mean a faculty member, that they 
probably ought to move along because they're not

22:04.600 --> 22:14.353
doing what they need to be doing. It's in their best 
career interest to move along because this

22:14.934 --> 22:22.364
environment is probably not good for them. I mean, 
I had tears. It was really a tough thing to do, but I

22:25.929 --> 22:30.355
said, I'm sorry. you're not gonna be getting 
tenure. And you may as well consider that right

22:33.171 --> 22:35.353
now. And then there was some of the old timers that 
had been there for some time that I felt like that

22:36.895 --> 22:49.391
they oughta be doing something different than 
what they were doing. And they didn't like it, but I

22:49.611 --> 22:54.558
felt like that they really had to do it. And in fact, 
one of them went to Shelton, And Shelton

22:59.933 --> 23:03.919
apparently told him that I was right. So he backed 
you? Yeah, he backed me completely, and that was

23:05.020 --> 23:07.424
good. Were there any pleasant moments, 
satisfying moments? Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, sure. I

23:15.555 --> 23:24.608
think, you know,

23:15.555 --> 23:24.608
you pass along, you know, sometimes you receive a 
gift and you just look for opportunities to I mean

23:25.567 --> 23:53.059
sometimes you receive a good thing through the 
goodness of somebody's actions or thoughts or

23:25.567 --> 23:53.059
something and I feel like I had the chance to do that 
on a couple of occasions the people ultimately

23:25.567 --> 23:53.059
left here but they were much I feel like by my giving 
them a break and you know encouraging them in some

23:25.567 --> 23:53.059
way I think they left here better people than than 
they would have been and that that was really it

23:53.748 --> 24:20.717
felt good um and in terms of hours that the duties 
god I never realized how much was there's a lot of

23:53.748 --> 24:20.717
paperwork maybe more than maybe because I was 
somewhat compulsive because I really you know I

23:53.748 --> 24:20.717
really tried to get everything outlined and 
really tried to well it's sort of like a Well, I

24:21.575 --> 24:23.177
guess sort of like a new bride or something. You 
really want to try to do everything as best you can.

24:26.520 --> 24:32.947
Now, did anybody, while you were department head, 
pull out the old card about you're not a DVM? No. The

24:36.271 --> 24:45.881
one individual who I said weren't going to get 
tenure kind of intimated that. But no, we really

24:47.442 --> 24:49.945
didn't. All right, and then did you seek the 
department headship on a permanent basis, or did

24:51.005 --> 24:58.695
you go back and say, thank you? Well, I didn't seek 
it, but I would have been happy to serve there for a

24:59.196 --> 25:03.422
while longer. They continued, and I suggested 
that they continue with the search. And there were

25:12.814 --> 25:19.223
two people that were interested in the project, in 
the position and I thought they were going to come.

25:24.379 --> 25:30.023
One person, one of the best persons that would have 
been a very, in my opinion, would have been a very

25:24.379 --> 25:30.023
good department head didn't come and the next best 
person uh did come and he was worked out to be pretty

25:31.724 --> 26:00.010
good too I'm talking about Ian Tizard Ian was Ian 
Tizard E-A-N no I-A-N I-A-N Tizard T-I-Z-A-R-D

25:31.724 --> 26:00.010
T-I-Z-A-R-D yeah he he he was my all right and he was 
here is he still here yeah he's still on the faculty

25:31.724 --> 26:00.010
and he served he served for a number of years 
actually uh Let's see, about five years ago, I'm

26:01.947 --> 26:06.553
talking about five years ago. And you went back to 
the full-time faculty, and what were your tasks

26:07.293 --> 26:13.541
then? Well, the people over in the Research 
Foundation, when they heard that I had taken the

26:13.561 --> 26:31.903
interim, I don't know if you know Jimmy Dodd or not, 
but he was sort of the person that did a lot of the

26:13.561 --> 26:31.903
groundwork for research proposals and so forth. 
He said he was disappointed that I went into the

26:33.200 --> 26:42.091
administration because he thought that I'd never 
be able to recover my research. I would never be

26:42.711 --> 27:02.835
able to get, by losing stride, I would never get 
back to the, and I felt like that, kind of felt like

26:42.711 --> 27:02.835
that too, but

26:42.711 --> 27:02.835
sort of shortly after I got back, I wrote a project 
again in the aquaculture area, one of the USDA

27:03.170 --> 27:07.577
competitive grants and got right back in there. 
All right so this is now in the about 80? About 81,

27:12.605 --> 27:14.248
82.

27:16.612 --> 27:20.919
Now let's go back to the campus-wide 
administration. You had positive words about Dr.

27:21.439 --> 27:28.671
Williams and Jarvis Miller becomes president 
after him.

27:29.579 --> 27:58.962
you said you had a story to well there's I I don't 
know you know uh yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna mention it

27:29.579 --> 27:58.962
see Jarvis used to be uh uh director of the 
experiment station for a while and Jarvis and John

27:29.579 --> 27:58.962
Calhoun um I got the impression that they didn't 
have much use for each other well see Calhoun

27:29.579 --> 27:58.962
resigned when the day Jarvis was appointed Okay, 
I'm not surprised at that. And then Jarvis

28:02.470 --> 28:07.435
replaced him with Mack Prescott as the vice 
president for academic affairs. Okay, okay. Cuz

28:08.276 --> 28:09.778
we didn't call it provost then. You're right, 
right. I was in a meeting one time. The purpose was,

28:13.723 --> 28:27.919
see, our program at the vet school was one of the 
larger programs, at one time, was one of the larger

28:13.723 --> 28:27.919
programs in Sea Grant. and John was in charge of Sea 
Grant and actually we had more to do with fisheries

28:28.709 --> 28:55.746
projects than the Department of Wildlife 
Fisheries did in Sea Grant and so

28:28.709 --> 28:55.746
it also most of the people in the vet school held an 
experiment halftime experiment station

28:28.709 --> 28:55.746
appointment so

28:56.637 --> 29:23.033
Jarvis was kind of looking out for the people in 
wildlife fisheries and kind of looking out for the

28:56.637 --> 29:23.033
people in vet medicine as far as Sea Grant was 
concerned and John was trying to do the same thing

28:56.637 --> 29:23.033
only they had had different perspectives on the 
way that it should be handled and so the two of them

28:56.637 --> 29:23.033
called a meeting a joint meeting that involved the 
Sea Grant people, the Sea Grant investigators,

29:23.688 --> 29:34.429
you know, me and several of the people out there at 
that school, and the people in Wildlife History

29:23.688 --> 29:34.429
Sciences, and we had a joint meeting. And, oh gosh, 
I can't remember all the verbiage that went

29:36.312 --> 29:42.945
around, but...

29:45.878 --> 29:52.167
John said something about, well, the vet school 
ought not to have all this stuff on fish. That's

29:52.187 --> 29:55.232
really the domain of the Wildlife Fishery Science 
Department. And Jarvis turned over to me and

29:56.553 --> 30:00.920
looked at me and asked me, he said, Dr. Lewis, do you 
feel that way? I mean, I was on the spot. I said,

30:03.383 --> 30:11.114
well, I think we just have to let the chips fall 
where they may. I think that you know that I'm not a

30:11.195 --> 30:14.940
veterinarian, but I think that... that any 
matters that have to do with animal health is

30:15.815 --> 30:24.645
logically part of the training of the veterinary 
profession. And it's time that the veterinary

30:24.705 --> 30:38.360
profession, I don't remember my exact words, but 
the veterinary profession should be encouraged

30:24.705 --> 30:38.360
to be involved in health care of fish just like 
they're involved in health. Their training leads

30:38.380 --> 30:40.042
to that. Well, I don't know whether that was, I 
don't know what what the what impressions were led

30:46.122 --> 31:02.848
left as a result of those comments or what but about 
well six months later I heard that Jarvis is going

30:46.122 --> 31:02.848
to be the president and that and and I didn't know 
for sure I didn't know I really didn't know what

31:03.301 --> 31:10.598
happened to John because someone else took over 
secret activities at that time. Yeah. Oh, well, I

31:11.460 --> 31:15.248
don't really know who that was. Was it Bob Berg? 
Worth Nallen? Worth Nallen, I believe, or Bob Berg

31:19.258 --> 31:22.525
was involved in it.
