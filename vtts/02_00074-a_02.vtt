WEBVTT

00:02.697 --> 00:06.901
Double chicken slash S to receive that. I don't 
believe we ever did it in our unit. I know we didn't.

00:13.286 --> 00:15.088
I know we didn't. So drownouts were considered 
kind of good fun? Good bull. OK, good bull. Yeah.

00:22.555 --> 00:23.515
Define good bull.

00:27.259 --> 00:32.063
Good bull, I think, to me, was doing something to 
the upperclassmen. Now, good bull goes up. It

00:34.074 --> 00:34.775
doesn't come down. You don't haze a freshman for 
good bull, I think. That's my opinion. Doing

00:42.183 --> 00:43.085
something to them. Because you're also telling 
them you're important. Because if they're the

00:46.208 --> 00:56.180
attraction of this, and maybe I didn't know it 
then, but I know it now, that you're paying

00:46.208 --> 00:56.180
attention to them, it makes, hey, you must be 
important. Or you must have, you know. And so you

00:59.164 --> 01:02.067
didn't want to leave anybody out. At least we 
didn't mess them up. I'm sure there was other kinds

01:05.315 --> 01:09.559
of... Could good bull be harmful in school? No, 
absolutely cannot be harmful. Never. And that's

01:12.602 --> 01:16.705
why... You asked me a question and I didn't finish 
the answer. It can never hurt anybody. It can't

01:20.208 --> 01:26.774
be... have a financial or harmful effect.

01:30.357 --> 01:31.058
It just... an action which may cause an 
embarrassment or a momentary loss of something

01:31.898 --> 01:44.417
that they find. Am I correct that the more nearly 
original, one of a kind it is, the better good bull

01:44.938 --> 01:51.367
it is? Oh, absolutely. I'm trying to remember. 
There was somebody, very few people had cars up

01:56.255 --> 02:00.040
there at the time. And There was, someone had a 
Volkswagen, and I don't know how it was done. I

02:06.837 --> 02:16.509
think it was, I think I was either a freshman or 
sophomore, but I don't know if I was either a

02:06.837 --> 02:16.509
sophomore or junior when this happened, but that 
car ended up on the third floor inside the dorm. And

02:16.589 --> 02:20.374
they, people actually carried that car around the 
stairs and up into the dorm. And you know, that,

02:20.394 --> 02:27.243
they didn't hurt anybody, but you can imagine, you 
walk out and there's your car outside your room.

02:27.663 --> 02:28.905
You know, it's... But pranks like that, I wish I 
could remember some more than I may remember some.

02:35.780 --> 02:39.705
What was it like to be a sophomore? Tell me about 
sophomore privileges. Very important position.

02:44.392 --> 02:47.276
I thought I was King Kong. I got purple stripes. And 
I didn't have them long, but I got them. And I prided

02:52.523 --> 02:58.892
myself in my dress and in my hair. a department of, I 
never marked the bullring. I never one time can I

03:04.298 --> 03:06.401
remember marked the bullring. And I got the 
merits, but not enough to get on the bullring.

03:17.156 --> 03:26.268
I think once I reported it, it was inclement 
weather and we did something else, which I thought

03:17.156 --> 03:26.268
was a terrible waste of time, as times go. But of 
course, you know, People would love to tell you, I

03:30.952 --> 03:52.479
think, and I would love to tell you that, boy, you 
know, I was the freshman's friend, and I really

03:30.952 --> 03:52.479
worked on training, but in respect we did, we 
weren't their friend to speak of, but we were

03:30.952 --> 03:52.479
concerned because it was our job to teach them 
certain things, like how you wear the uniform, how

03:30.952 --> 03:52.479
to march. Sometimes, and I'm not going to say I 
didn't go overboard, we all went overboard.

03:57.225 --> 03:58.647
That's part of the learning process of of 
responsibility and finding the line. And you've

04:03.012 --> 04:04.875
got to cross it to find it sometimes. And I made a 
cross because I lost my corporal stripes. When did

04:09.421 --> 04:18.292
you feel, describe for me the emotional 
circumstance when you officially became a

04:09.421 --> 04:18.292
sophomore? Well, of course, that was at

04:18.312 --> 04:24.921
senior review. And that's when you're officially 
a sophomore and you start feeling, there's no

04:25.407 --> 04:34.199
freshman around, but the juniors then start 
treating you like a human being. And do you

04:34.239 --> 04:42.391
remember anybody saying or doing anything that 
made you feel, okay, it's really finally

04:34.239 --> 04:42.391
happened?

04:42.411 --> 04:46.216
I suspect that the first sergeant gave us a pep talk 
about it. And certainly when we got back, there was

04:46.337 --> 04:53.727
a lot of means to align our responsibilities and 
and how important it was to be a good sophomore. But

04:57.612 --> 05:04.962
a final review is when you put on your brass and you 
wear your hat a little different. And you can call,

05:04.982 --> 05:10.710
instead of calling somebody a mystery, you call 
them by their last name. And then if their desire to

05:10.830 --> 05:16.037
drop handles with you, they do so. Even though a lot 
of people drop handles as freshmen. And those, you

05:20.123 --> 05:22.566
call by their first name Now, I presume that you 
didn't have any family there for that final

05:23.238 --> 05:30.507
review, you're afraid, you're fishing. Let's 
jump to academics. Some special teachers,

05:33.190 --> 05:42.361
advisors, counselors that you remember as being 
important to your academic preparation. You

05:44.104 --> 05:49.330
know, I thought C.K.

05:50.153 --> 05:50.654
English? English, yeah. C.K. Estes. Estes, yeah, 
C.K. He was also the announcer at the football game

05:55.661 --> 06:00.949
for so long. I had English with him as a, I guess as a 
junior, and he was a very interesting man. He was

06:08.941 --> 06:16.752
just absolutely, where I feel like people are 
trying to challenge our thinking, and not

06:08.941 --> 06:16.752
necessarily our I mean, we had to write a lot and do a 
lot of things, but he was just so interesting from

06:17.238 --> 06:26.087
being a civil engineering major. I enjoyed the 
math courses. Teddy Hirsch at the time was a TTI. I

06:35.156 --> 06:36.978
think he was working on a doctorate. And I had a 
sophomore course with him in something in

06:36.998 --> 06:45.827
engineering, and he was really interesting. Dr. 
Harrington. Well, there were two Dr. Harrington

06:48.478 --> 06:51.261
at the time. One of the top hydraulics to us. Of 
course, even my brothers had just gone through.

06:55.787 --> 07:01.133
And so they kind of picked on me a little bit from the 
standpoint of another Fernandez coming through.

07:01.173 --> 07:03.516
Not picked on me, but picked on me fun-wise. And I 
felt important them doing that, frankly.

07:12.187 --> 07:15.831
Joe Sorrells in soils was an excellent 
instructor. General Buchanan. Spencer. He's

07:20.568 --> 07:21.089
elderly. Spencer, yeah. I remember that he taught 
us a course, and we were seniors, and starting to

07:23.673 --> 07:34.289
think about, hey, what do you do, and what word do 
you use when you hit your jobs?

07:36.372 --> 07:37.814
You know, those kinds of things.

07:41.199 --> 07:41.860
Let's see. History.

07:45.680 --> 07:57.993
Haskell, I took, I know, one history course, maybe 
both, in summer school, where I could concentrate

07:45.680 --> 07:57.993
on them. Because I would go to summer school when 
I'd go back to Laredo and go to junior college. I

08:01.316 --> 08:02.438
know I took a history course there. I don't 
remember taking a history course at College

08:03.238 --> 08:06.702
Station. You said chemistry, math? Chemistry was 
challenging. Who? Do you remember who it was? The

08:13.369 --> 08:15.231
one I flunked or the one I passed? I passed 
chemistry one, and... John Beckham, by chance?

08:22.807 --> 08:23.828
No, I didn't have Beckham. And then I flunked 
chemistry two, and then I took it my sophomore

08:23.908 --> 08:26.952
year. And, you know, there's quizzes that float 
around. And academically, I probably...

08:30.956 --> 08:34.180
Chemistry wasn't my best subject. And I probably 
went in with a 70 into the final exam. And you don't

08:37.885 --> 08:40.888
study for chemistry? What do you do? So, Halloween 
is, my dear friend, the Greek from Houston... He

08:47.442 --> 08:49.064
had an old final. We didn't know where it was from. 
We studied that. And four of us studied it. I'd

08:54.973 --> 08:56.014
probably go to jail today. But no, it was legal. 
They were around. They were here to criticize. And

09:00.400 --> 09:01.662
we didn't steal it. But we studied that. And just in 
case, we happened to get this exam. Hey, let's not

09:10.575 --> 09:12.337
sit anywhere close together. So we sat in four 
different corners. And just four of us studied it.

09:17.530 --> 09:18.291
Verbatim. I mean, it was exactly. I mean, that's 
the most astonishing thing that ever happened to

09:21.455 --> 09:24.039
me. That's the fault of the faculty member. I don't 
know. I might not have passed the second time he had

09:27.364 --> 09:29.487
been there. He probably said, how did this guy get 
so smart so quick? I know he's not. Do you remember

09:35.515 --> 09:38.720
any of the faculty nicknames?

09:40.362 --> 09:43.386
Yeah, in our course of civil engineering, Snuffy 
Smith. Why was he called Snowfield? Oh, I think he

09:45.390 --> 09:47.414
had a nasal problem. I think that's right. I've 
seen a book recently where we had some of these

09:50.842 --> 09:54.129
nicknames. And who else was there? There was 
another gentleman, such a neat man. Oh, what a

10:02.487 --> 10:03.670
gentleman.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.922
but none other than the nickname. He just always 
had such a nice presence about him. But Dr. Wright

10:11.006 --> 10:13.068
was the department chair. We didn't interact with 
the department chair a whole lot. He didn't

10:16.733 --> 10:17.314
either. I never took a course with him. But... All 
right, what about over in the Corps area? Attack

10:24.383 --> 10:27.166
officers, commandants? We had favorite attack 
officers. Of course, we had nicknames for them.

10:32.233 --> 10:36.238
There was the Goose, and there was Porky. The 
Goose, I'm trying to think of his name, his brother

10:37.197 --> 10:42.564
was in our class. Goose had a brother that was class 
59.

10:49.314 --> 10:51.777
And then, I swear, I can't remember the last name. 
Give me a chance, when it was Lieutenant

10:51.837 --> 10:58.747
Hornstein, I still see Hornstein from time to 
time. Who was the commandant then? Moore? No, not

11:01.671 --> 11:02.912
Moore, excuse me. Joe...

11:07.218 --> 11:08.900
Joe Davis. Joe Davis. Joe Davis. All right. Now, do 
I remember Fighting Joe? Was that the nickname he

11:13.565 --> 11:15.807
had? He was too high up there for us to get a nickname 
to. But one time we were lining up for supper to go to

11:17.809 --> 11:27.099
dinner, and of course the goose had a very, well, he 
was called the goose. He had a very posture kind of

11:27.119 --> 11:35.268
problem that he kind of looked like a goose when the 
upper half of his body kind of tilted forward. You

11:35.288 --> 11:36.229
know how a goose looks. And then Porky had 
obviously the statistics to go with that. And they

11:42.429 --> 11:50.298
were up there and they were calling to, and by that 
time we were in the Duncan area. And the steam

11:50.318 --> 12:01.170
tunnel, you know, the lid opens up, boom, out comes 
a pig, out comes a goose, and they just scatter. The

12:01.437 --> 12:02.958
whole court just died laughing. And boy, they 
turned red and green and every color in the

12:03.039 --> 12:07.263
booklet. Those were pranks. They didn't hurt 
anybody. That's a good book. That's a good book.

12:16.792 --> 12:17.212
All right. Classroom behavior. What do you, as you 
look back, what were the unwritten or maybe well

12:18.774 --> 12:28.643
understood rules of classroom behavior?

12:32.437 --> 12:36.903
We didn't have a behavior problem in the classroom 
that I remember. Did you all go to class regularly?

12:38.525 --> 12:38.986
Absolutely. Did you stay awake? Most of the time.

12:48.379 --> 12:59.254
The only time I've had a problem is maybe I was up 
working all night on a lab or on a problem that we

12:48.379 --> 12:59.254
turned in, and many, many times we saw the sun come 
up. finishing up a report, because that's a

12:59.740 --> 13:04.346
procrastinator. But we were there, and we were 
attentive, and the instructors were of quality

13:04.466 --> 13:12.076
that I remember. Were they available when you 
needed them, if you wanted to see them? They

13:16.602 --> 13:19.066
weren't there ten minutes after the hour. There 
was nobody else there to read them. But if you

13:21.248 --> 13:26.275
needed to go see them one-on-one, seek advice, you 
could find them? Yes. You know, I never... I never

13:29.980 --> 13:31.422
had, I never did that. Maybe I should have. Maybe I 
would have gotten out in four and a half years. But

13:34.587 --> 13:38.052
they were, they were certainly, especially when 
you're in the department.

13:41.277 --> 13:46.746
You know, we took, a freshman took mechanical 
drawing, took English, math. See, I was a math

13:46.766 --> 13:47.607
whiz. And I thought, man, this is a piece of cake. 
And I almost didn't pass math with a freshman. I

13:52.995 --> 13:56.781
just, I think I took it too lightly.

13:58.499 --> 14:02.024
I posted a .89 my first semester. And I went up there 
with, you know, I had pretty good, I had very good

14:02.044 --> 14:09.095
high school preparation. They prepared us 
excellent. And I think just, you know, finding,

14:11.378 --> 14:21.894
learning how to, number one, schedule one's time 
and those kind of things. But it got my attention. I

14:22.695 --> 14:24.477
got on probation the first semester. Did you have 
in math square root Jackson or cube root Kent,

14:24.497 --> 14:27.662
either one? No, but I heard of it, yeah. Let's see, 
let's go to activities. YMCA, do you remember? We

14:36.955 --> 14:37.696
didn't do Y. All right, MSC. MSC was, because I 
worked there, and it was... What role did it play in

14:39.698 --> 14:49.630
the typical student's life? Our post office box 
was there. Either, well, when we were... If you

14:56.735 --> 14:59.078
lived around Duncan, it was there. If you lived at 
the other, it was the one on the corner of

14:59.138 --> 15:02.443
Northgate. But, you know, so you went there. It was 
kind of a place between classes. We didn't really

15:12.999 --> 15:14.441
hang out there. Were you proud of it? I was, sure. 
That was built in 50, right? Opened in 50, and I was

15:21.076 --> 15:24.621
there in 55. Did you and Wayne Stark ever interact? 
I knew him. I didn't interact with him as I heard he

15:28.847 --> 15:36.658
interacted with some tremendous students. Guy 
and Hall, did you ever go? Fantastic. What was

15:40.524 --> 15:42.446
important about Guy? Well, there were two shows 
going on. There was a show on the screen, and there

15:47.107 --> 15:55.259
was a show, and the comments of the roommate, and a 
lot of it. It was just a fun place to be. And was the

15:57.383 --> 16:00.608
audience almost entirely all students? Yes. Do 
you remember anything ever being said that was bad

16:02.290 --> 16:07.879
taste? No, absolutely not. Let me just clarify 
that. Never any profanity.

16:17.752 --> 16:20.335
And I'm pretty conscious of that, even as a young 
man. And

16:20.375 --> 16:27.184
our values move around in our...

16:30.508 --> 16:37.657
But for college, the campus of the day, nothing 
grows. It was okay. Do you remember any important

16:40.800 --> 16:46.948
lecturers or famous personalities that ever came 
to? speak at Guyon? No, I don't.

16:54.416 --> 17:01.024
And I know there were sometimes religious related 
activities in Guyon. We went to, you know, the

17:01.985 --> 17:04.929
Catholic Church was very active. You know, I was so 
busy when I was a student. Number one, working.

17:12.458 --> 17:15.282
Number two, playing corps cadets, which probably 
If you ask me in what order, that, and then

17:15.835 --> 17:20.540
academics. And then my days were full. And 
intramurals. I loved intramurals. We did that.

17:27.548 --> 17:30.892
And the core activities and everything. I didn't 
have a lot of time. And I never, to my loss,

17:32.754 --> 17:41.504
participated in any of the, I think SCOAN started 
about that time, if I remember correctly. And

17:41.544 --> 17:44.307
there were other things that were available. Did 
you go on weekends? Did you go to Mass? Yes. Where?

17:50.454 --> 17:52.777
At the, what is it, St. Ann's? St. John's? I can't 
remember. I want to say St. Mary's, but I don't

17:59.086 --> 18:01.629
think that's right. Yeah, I think St. Mary's. I 
can't remember the priest's name. As you recall, a

18:04.453 --> 18:12.083
typical Sunday morning, the audience would be 
made up of what? Mostly students or half students?

18:14.831 --> 18:24.564
No, there was, there was, we can't identify with a 
lot of faculty, but there was, especially on

18:14.831 --> 18:24.564
weekends, there were a couple there, parents and 
folks like that. Of course, at that time, parents

18:25.204 --> 18:33.315
didn't come up to the university like we were able 
to enjoy when our kids were there. My mother went

18:34.116 --> 18:38.001
for my graduation. The only time she went to the 
campus. I don't think my father ever went. Do you

18:42.725 --> 18:46.049
remember religious emphasis week in the spring? 
Yes. Do you remember participating? Well, it was

18:51.396 --> 18:55.221
just like any other week of religion. We went every 
Sunday to Mass. And also, I guess at Mass you see

18:58.105 --> 19:01.750
your hometown buddies, but most of them were 
Catholic. And we would see each other there. And

19:05.094 --> 19:10.381
Sunday was a softer day than others. Thank you. Do 
you remember any, now as you look back, any

19:12.340 --> 19:23.415
life-changing conversation or events during 
your student years? Events? Yeah, where? Many,

19:25.619 --> 19:26.700
many events. Share some.

19:35.232 --> 19:40.179
It impacted me.

19:40.199 --> 19:40.980
Remember I told you that the group or the company 
that had the best General Moore got the top floor.

19:50.496 --> 19:54.181
And when we were juniors, we were on the bottom 
floor.

19:57.126 --> 19:58.368
And that was humiliation.

20:02.794 --> 20:07.862
Paul Buenas was the first sergeant and Tommy Lone 
was platoon leader, and I can't recall who the

20:09.884 --> 20:12.908
other one was. And then we all, we had a meeting the 
first week of school as juniors, okay? And you

20:21.960 --> 20:29.129
couldn't stand the humiliation of not being the 
best outfit in that battalion. So what we did, we

20:29.149 --> 20:33.615
set a goal to win general war. And we said, here, 
this is how you're graded. Okay, you're in charge

20:40.276 --> 20:46.285
of this, you're in charge of this, you're in charge 
of that. You're in charge of intramurals. And then

20:48.828 --> 20:50.371
I became the intramural sergeant. And we all had a 
job. And we were always strong in student

20:54.316 --> 21:00.285
leadership. We didn't have a class that didn't 
have a vice president, president class. We

21:06.234 --> 21:09.118
motivated our people and they motivated us. to 
seek out and to do the kinds of things that

21:09.993 --> 21:15.319
interested us. And we had a program the time 
before. And so there's no reason for you to get a

21:19.343 --> 21:23.147
forfeit. The least you can do is show up and 
represent. And then if you show up and have a little

21:26.491 --> 21:30.195
bit of organization, and that was my job. And we 
came in the top 10, both upperclassmen and

21:30.656 --> 21:38.705
freshmen, from down in the nobody even noticed. We 
came in second in marching. who came in high in

21:40.604 --> 21:43.328
grades. Bottom line, we wanted to know more. Now 
see, that's the kind of thing that I treasure in

21:47.555 --> 21:50.199
here. Do you remember any one-on-one 
conversations with a faculty member or an advisor

21:50.860 --> 21:58.491
that you now realize were important to you?

22:03.519 --> 22:08.687
Not one that just, you know, that I would get to 
pull, even though they were all extremely kind and

22:09.393 --> 22:14.100
helpful, and they had to be to get me through. I 
mean, I know I challenged some of them, but getting

22:14.120 --> 22:24.514
back to the General Moore deal, it taught me that I 
can do anything. And if you work in a group with

22:24.534 --> 22:37.392
someone responsible for something, that you can 
get a team going and You may not win that brass ring,

22:38.958 --> 22:48.191
but we can sure, by proper planning and hard work, 
can do anything. And I was so proud. It was one of the

22:49.793 --> 22:52.878
proudest moments of my life. You showed that while 
ago in your response. Describe, in general, the

22:57.925 --> 23:08.560
student body when you were there, economically, 
geographic origin, ethnic, et cetera.

23:11.780 --> 23:12.341
Economically. Economically, I guess even though 
it wasn't important, you could tell who came from a

23:12.461 --> 23:26.414
little more affluent family because they might 
have a car in the parking lot even though there were

23:12.461 --> 23:26.414
very few cars. By and large, were the students 
rich? No, I didn't think so. I would have been

23:31.399 --> 23:34.421
surprised if you had said yes. No, most of us were 
from small towns and big towns, but just ordinary

23:34.441 --> 23:41.348
people. Ordinary people. And a high percentage of 
first-generation college students, I bet.

23:49.959 --> 23:54.686
Frankly, I don't think it was a topic of interest. I 
wouldn't be surprised. I know we were serving the

23:56.609 --> 24:01.917
first generation of our family, Brother Gus and 
Albert and I. But everybody wore the same uniform,

24:01.937 --> 24:07.966
and you really couldn't tell. And nobody ever 
flunked it. You know, flaunted that. Let's see.

24:15.907 --> 24:28.705
There were, of course, there were no blacks, and 
there was, there was a, not a handful, there was a

24:15.907 --> 24:28.705
considerable number of Mexican-Americans, a lot 
from Laredo, from San Antonio, and a lot of other

24:15.907 --> 24:28.705
areas. It wasn't, I wasn't the only one there. Did 
any, did you or anyone else feel that you were

24:30.968 --> 24:40.461
handicapped

24:41.858 --> 24:45.402
in being selected for anything because of your 
background. It's a non-factor. Not to get it or to

24:50.026 --> 24:51.167
get it. I would have been surprised if you had said 
otherwise. I know Hector Gutierrez well. And

24:59.616 --> 25:06.583
Hector says the fact that he was corps commander, 
he said that had nothing to do with my last name,

24:59.616 --> 25:06.583
which I say hooray. Let's see. Optional student 
organizations. Was the singing cadets, were they

25:12.470 --> 25:15.254
around then? They were around. Did you all have a, 
to being a singing cadet, was that a plus or a minus

25:16.775 --> 25:22.062
for anybody? You know, they weren't as visible at 
that time as they are today, even though, well,

25:22.563 --> 25:32.175
maybe to where they presented were more visible. 
We probably did, it was like those that did it, it

25:33.276 --> 25:41.667
was like those in the band, you know, it wasn't 
something that was a negative or a positive. What

25:45.756 --> 25:46.757
about the band? Was that a high prestige?

25:52.824 --> 25:57.669
I'm hesitating because I want to be sure that I 
think about the question. You know, even being

25:59.931 --> 26:05.737
athletes at that time, you know, I took classes 
with Richard Gay. He was a C.E. major and with a lot

26:06.938 --> 26:12.244
of other football players and basketball 
players. It was... Did y'all make fun of the band

26:12.697 --> 26:16.962
members? No, absolutely not. That surprised me 
when I... And I guess that's probably a good fun,

26:18.384 --> 26:24.611
maybe even a little jealousy there. I hold them in 
awe. We were their best supporters. We never left

26:33.421 --> 26:34.943
the stands at halftime. The band was important to 
us. But it wasn't like they were a notch above or a

26:38.007 --> 26:42.552
notch below because they were or weren't What 
would have been the most notable student

26:43.291 --> 26:51.401
leadership position?

26:54.025 --> 26:55.286
In my opinion? Then and now? No, then. Then. Then 
and now. Oh. Company commander. Company

27:00.273 --> 27:01.574
commander. That's where the rubber meets the 
road. Oh, okay. Because student body president

27:05.532 --> 27:09.297
wasn't a big deal. It was pretty important. Was it? 
That was, yeah. Okay. That was. But I still, you

27:12.121 --> 27:22.956
see, the unit commander is the, at that time, there 
was three buttons. And to me, that was the most

27:22.976 --> 27:25.039
prestigious. Yeah, my roommate was student body 
president. John Thomas. Oh, yeah. One of my

27:31.167 --> 27:32.549
roommates. And... But we trained and we prepared 
for those kinds of jobs in my outfit. And it was part

27:40.681 --> 27:43.563
of doing our job. And we had, you know, we had that 
year, the class vice president was a member of our

27:44.084 --> 27:54.173
outfit.

27:57.596 --> 28:03.822
And like I said, in every class we had somebody from 
our outfit in one of the four offices. But I think

28:04.342 --> 28:13.733
that the company commander is the most 
prestigious position.

28:15.516 --> 28:16.036
Let's see. RVs? Prestigious. First real team. 
Now, I'm not asking if you were one or not. I was not.

28:30.059 --> 28:31.301
No, no, no, no, no. RVs never know what I mean. They 
don't have grades. I'm about to ask them another

28:34.165 --> 28:37.289
question. Were you aware there were any secret 
fraternities when you were a student? No, I was

28:40.974 --> 28:41.655
not. No, no, you were not aware? I was not aware. 
Okay. Because as I've done these interviews, a few

28:45.881 --> 28:50.608
people have given me guarded answers. Yes, they 
heard about the TTs and the stickers, but... I

28:57.667 --> 28:58.548
haven't gotten any. I don't know anybody that was 
in

28:58.668 --> 29:03.654
one. I don't know. Oh, you know the funny story, if 
you want to know the funny story. Please do. As,

29:08.600 --> 29:11.543
because you know, we go to summer camp as juniors. 
Okay, I was, I wasn't a hellraiser, but I was, I was

29:12.464 --> 29:19.312
active, let me put it that way. But I was also active 
in the plus things, and maybe, you know, I lived

29:19.332 --> 29:25.159
close to the line, and... And I was doing a lot of 
things. My grades were marginal, but I took corps

29:28.330 --> 29:39.625
seriously, even though some of the tech officers 
in the commandant's office might have said, well,

29:28.330 --> 29:39.625
I don't know about him. But when we went to summer 
camp, again, you know, play the game. And I was

29:46.033 --> 29:49.898
selected And you go and you're bunched in with a 
bunch of people from other schools, St. Mary's,

29:50.283 --> 30:03.095
Providence, there was Oklahoma, and we went to 
Hood. And I got selected number two. I was the

30:07.058 --> 30:10.822
number two cadet in this company. But Aggies 
usually score high. And the number one cadet, I

30:13.064 --> 30:19.530
think it was, it was an Aggie, and I think it may have 
been Fred Capra. They do about an alphabet. But

30:22.225 --> 30:27.032
anyway, I was recommended for a distinguished 
military student. And I know they had a very good

30:28.835 --> 30:35.204
laugh about that in the commandant's office when 
that recommendation came down. And I saw the

30:35.304 --> 30:40.371
letter, but I didn't have the craze, number one. 
But I had the will.

30:46.921 --> 30:47.762
Let's see. Describe a basketball game in G 
Raleigh. Loud, fun. We had more, we had a large

30:56.216 --> 30:59.841
contingent of the band, if I remember correctly. 
It was a, it was pretty, it wasn't a skeleton, it

30:59.921 --> 31:05.830
wasn't a skeleton band. And we went, we went to the 
basketball games. Do you remember any pranks or

31:09.675 --> 31:15.724
jokes at a basketball game? Any tricks they were 
played on anybody? No, no they don't. I haven't

31:21.889 --> 31:22.893
heard of any. They didn't play a lot of baseball 
games.
