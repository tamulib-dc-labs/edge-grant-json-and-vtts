WEBVTT

00:04.013 --> 00:08.840
And we went back to the hospital and we did the 
surgery. They stayed here in town in a motel until

00:08.880 --> 00:12.365
the surgery was over. Then they flew out. And then 
later when the dog recovered, they flew back in.

00:17.693 --> 00:22.199
And they own Harry and David's Orchards in the 
state of Washington. I guess the largest fruit

00:22.600 --> 00:27.006
shipping company in the whole US. Now most of these 
were canine? Most were canine. I did some feline.

00:33.545 --> 00:36.269
And I did a few exotics. Such as? I did a Bengal tiger 
once, which was a real challenge. But I didn't go in

00:42.797 --> 00:45.180
the surgery room until he was under anesthesia. 
From where did he come? It was from a zoo. Okay. And

00:49.526 --> 00:50.127
why here? Because we had developed that specialty 
and they knew to call here and that we had the

00:52.049 --> 01:00.160
capabilities to handle that kind of animal. Now, 
surely there must have been some goofy situations

01:00.308 --> 01:04.513
or something. Oh, there were a lot of fun times that 
we had. One time, I'll never forget this. We had,

01:09.398 --> 01:15.465
back in the surgery recovery area, we had these 
small cages where they would recover from

01:09.398 --> 01:15.465
anesthesia. And we had done surgery on a little 
chihuahua that probably weighed three or four

01:16.046 --> 01:19.770
pounds. And he was in his cage and already 
recovered and was on his feet. And one of the

01:24.835 --> 01:27.278
students went over to the large animal clinic and 
got a whole little bowl of horse apple feces and

01:27.747 --> 01:41.128
came in and put it in the cage with that little bitty 
chihuahua, giving the impression that he had

01:27.747 --> 01:41.128
deposited that enormous amount. And of course 
that brought the house down. And I will never

01:42.991 --> 01:46.937
forget one other thing that happened when I was a 
faculty member. There was a professor here that

01:48.219 --> 01:53.046
taught business law named Judge Stewart. And he 
was a character, and I had had him for

01:53.414 --> 02:00.522
jurisprudence when I was a veterinary student. 
And he was salty, but probably the most

02:00.542 --> 02:06.449
entertaining professor I ever had. But 
everybody's kind of afraid of him, and he couldn't

02:06.990 --> 02:17.262
drive because I think he'd had his license 
revoked, because he liked the bottle a little. But

02:18.243 --> 02:20.586
his wife brought their cat, to the small animal 
clinic and that cat got out of the cage when the

02:21.190 --> 02:37.925
student was taking it out and got behind the cages 
and they could not get the cat out and she was at the

02:21.190 --> 02:37.925
front desk to take that cat home. So everybody was 
running around there so fearful of what he would do

02:38.726 --> 02:49.155
and you know they could just see him coming out 
there and blowing up and lawsuit and what all might

02:38.726 --> 02:49.155
happen. And it took two or three days to get that cat 
out from behind that

02:49.625 --> 02:56.272
cage. Any glamorous Texans pets that you had to 
deal with? Governors, politicians, board

03:05.202 --> 03:11.289
members, coaches, millionaires?

03:15.314 --> 03:16.375
We did have

03:19.443 --> 03:24.410
And I don't, this was after I came back though, 
after going to the University of Tennessee. We had

03:24.930 --> 03:26.412
Bumbright's dog. I don't recall any major ones at 
that time. And in doing this surgery, you had

03:33.862 --> 03:42.013
students as a learning experience for them who 
were assisting you? In the teaching hospital, Not

03:44.401 --> 04:01.360
only did, of course, the students have the 
lectures and the laboratories where they

03:44.401 --> 04:01.360
practiced, but then when they were assigned 
hospital duty rotations, they would rotate among

03:44.401 --> 04:01.360
the different disciplines such as 
anesthesiology, emergency medicine, and mine

03:44.401 --> 04:01.360
was neurosurgery. And we usually had four 
students assigned to us for an entire week. Those

04:06.566 --> 04:12.332
four students would work with us on every one of our 
cases from the time we admitted them through all

04:12.785 --> 04:17.731
the diagnostics, to the time of surgery, to the 
time of recovery. And of course they would inherit

04:17.771 --> 04:23.277
cases that were in different stages of their 
hospital stay. And the students would be

04:24.278 --> 04:28.483
responsible for the medical records. Ultimately 
I was as the attending doctor. But the student had

04:33.809 --> 04:35.310
to write it up. They gave the medications, 
recorded it. They were responsible for calling

04:42.637 --> 04:48.202
an owner and giving them an update. They scrubbed 
in in surgery. They would take turns in doing that.

04:53.648 --> 04:55.029
They would watch anesthesia. And just the whole 
care that would happen. And if they had to stay all

04:59.013 --> 05:03.217
night, it was their responsibility to stay all 
night with their patient. And they were given a

05:03.958 --> 05:07.141
certain assignment for a specific number of 
cases. So they stayed a week with us. And you get to

05:10.424 --> 05:11.665
know people pretty pretty closely in that kind of 
week's period of time and they knew what the

05:11.881 --> 05:36.420
grading criteria would be for that week so every 
week I had to sit down with a grading card that had a

05:11.881 --> 05:36.420
set number of criteria based upon clinical skills 
background knowledge just the whole spectrum

05:11.881 --> 05:36.420
of responsible teaching activities that we had 
toward them to see if they would pass it. And

05:44.860 --> 05:53.111
normally on one of those surgeries about how long 
did the surgical process take? That varied but I

05:55.695 --> 06:02.965
would say I was a fast surgeon and most of the time My 
procedure from incision to closure was no more

06:03.333 --> 06:09.880
than 20, 30 minutes. If it was a complicated case, 
such as a fractured back where I had to go in and put

06:10.561 --> 06:18.870
steel plates or something, those could take up to 
two hours. Most of the time, not much more than an

06:19.490 --> 06:23.254
hour, hour and a half. If it were a brain surgery, 
which we did a number of those, brain tumor, head

06:23.855 --> 06:33.205
trauma, those were more complicated and would go 
an hour, hour and a half. So from the time the animal

06:33.607 --> 06:40.690
was injected to... No, that's actual surgical 
procedure. From the time of anesthesia to the time

06:40.710 --> 06:45.405
of recovery was probably no less than... That 
would probably be an hour and a half to two hours on

06:46.195 --> 06:49.021
all of those. And then would that animal then be 
capable of walking immediately? We had to stay

06:54.151 --> 06:55.213
with them. You have to help them. They're not like a 
human patient that you can keep on a bed. A lot of

06:59.121 --> 07:03.309
times the students have to hold them because when 
they start trying to wake, they fall around. They

07:03.349 --> 07:05.093
have to hold them until they get ambulatory. Once 
they were ambulatory, then you could clearly

07:07.492 --> 07:09.936
allowed on their own. And was it normal for them to 
become ambulatory within a few hours? Yeah,

07:14.123 --> 07:18.530
actually you start lightening the anesthesia as 
you're closing the skin. So most of them were

07:18.570 --> 07:25.381
ambulatory within two hours after the surgery. 
And almost all of these were pets? They were all

07:28.567 --> 07:29.989
pets. And

07:30.323 --> 07:44.238
did you detect in those students much difference 
between their talents, ambitions, et cetera,

07:30.323 --> 07:44.238
than you and your classmates?

07:48.523 --> 07:50.946
No, I wouldn't say that I saw any of that. I would say 
that I saw them have the opportunity to be able to do

07:54.961 --> 08:03.092
things that we had not been able to do simply 
because people were now willing to pay for it. So

08:03.773 --> 08:06.056
they got to do a lot more of the new exciting things. 
Of course, that was great for us because here we

08:06.096 --> 08:09.340
were implementing a lot of those. And it was a great 
time for me career wise because I was getting to

08:10.121 --> 08:20.935
pioneer a lot of the neurosurgery that's 
currently done in the dog and to travel the

08:10.121 --> 08:20.935
country. and give presentations and give 
continuing education seminars and actually do

08:21.505 --> 08:28.353
live surgical demonstrations. A lot of times we 
did closed circuit TV. And this was the cost of this

08:31.296 --> 08:38.864
was paid for by the owner. So it was 
self-sustaining. Self-sustaining. See, that

08:43.549 --> 08:50.517
was one other part of the teaching component was to 
teach the students the business side of it because

08:43.549 --> 08:50.517
the complaints in almost all medical professions 
was the students don't know about that business

08:51.087 --> 08:57.694
side of it, which is a side of it. And most of the time 
when you're going to veterinary college, you just

08:58.315 --> 09:01.698
don't want to even face that. But we had to because 
the hospital had to sustain itself based on the

09:01.778 --> 09:07.124
revenue of the cases. And we had to teach that as a 
part of the responsibility. Now, this was a

09:10.747 --> 09:12.289
12-month year? Oh, yeah. And you're here how long 
in that stretch? I stayed in that stretch from 1969

09:20.517 --> 09:24.222
March of 1969 to October of 1974.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.108
And then go to? I went to the University of 
Tennessee, and I was 32 years old, and that's where

09:28.569 --> 09:35.219
I entered administration. How did that come 
about? Well, that's real interesting. Can you

09:42.529 --> 09:42.930
stop

09:59.836 --> 10:09.607
And I get a phone call, and one of the secretaries 
came down and said, it's an important call from the

09:59.836 --> 10:09.607
Colton Party. So I go down to my office, and I

10:09.627 --> 10:26.026
see a doctor

10:09.627 --> 10:26.026
who currently is a dean at Michigan State College 
of Internal Medicine. And he said, I don't know

10:26.086 --> 10:28.729
whether you've heard or not, But we're starting a 
new college of veterinary medicine at the

10:29.502 --> 10:34.328
University of Tennessee, and I'm going to be the 
new dean. And I just wondered if you would have any

10:36.070 --> 10:45.022
interest in being head of the small animal 
medicine and the surgery department. Well, that

10:45.042 --> 10:50.469
almost knocked me on the floor because I thought, 
my, how is he calling me? And he said, my wife and I

10:51.310 --> 10:59.020
are going to the American Veterinary Medical 
Association in July in Denver. And he said, I

10:59.658 --> 11:02.101
notice you're on the program to speak. I said, 
would you be willing to have breakfast?

11:07.969 --> 11:16.519
So it was one of those things where it was a life goal 
to get into administration. And it was the next

11:17.461 --> 11:19.924
logical step for me. I had already been promoted to 
associate professor in two years. So I thought,

11:24.409 --> 11:28.855
why would they be asking an associate professor to 
be a department head. So I was flattered and we

11:33.538 --> 11:40.285
went, my wife and I both, we had breakfast with him. 
He told me that he was leaving to go there in August

11:41.346 --> 11:54.420
and that he would like for us to fly up and interview 
in late August. And he would show me the campus. He

11:57.994 --> 12:00.778
would tell me the plans and what they were going to 
be doing. So we flew up there in September, or no,

12:02.080 --> 12:08.970
late August of 1974.

12:11.794 --> 12:13.777
And great interview. And everything just went, I 
mean, you couldn't orchestrate it to go any

12:14.178 --> 12:17.603
better. And I kept going through my mind, who are 
all the other candidates that he is going to be

12:23.864 --> 12:25.766
interviewing. Who are my peers across the nation, 
much older than me, that he's going to also

12:25.846 --> 12:31.893
interview? And he offered me the job on the spot. 
And he said, I know this is a little unusual, but he

12:35.938 --> 12:48.893
said, I've made up my mind that the people I want to 
recruit, and they have given me the latitude of

12:35.938 --> 12:48.893
starting this college by selecting my leadership 
team. And he said, I want you to come and head up the

12:52.619 --> 12:56.543
small animal medicine surgery department. Well, 
I said, well, my wife and I need to go home and think

12:56.563 --> 13:00.427
about it. You know, our families are in Texas. I 
have so much loyalty to Texas A&M. But at the same

13:06.133 --> 13:12.219
time, I knew that it was a career opportunity that I 
had to seriously look at. So we got home, and we just

13:12.839 --> 13:15.682
knew where we were going to go. And within two days, 
I called him back, and I said, yes, we will come. And

13:20.902 --> 13:27.428
so in October of 1974, we left and moved up there. 
And I was the first person there after the dean was

13:27.468 --> 13:31.231
there. So it was just the two of us for three or four 
months to start the program from scratch. And we

13:40.159 --> 13:44.303
had the opportunity to build the facilities, to 
recruit the faculty. I mean, everything was brand

13:45.403 --> 13:47.345
new. And I later asked him, because all the other 
department heads and deans were older than I was.

13:57.471 --> 14:03.517
And incidentally, one was an Aggie, Horace 
Barron, who had taught in a large animal clinic

13:57.471 --> 14:03.517
here. So later I asked him, I said, Bill, why did you 
select me for that position? And he said, well, you

14:13.747 --> 14:20.473
don't remember this, but he said, you came to 
Michigan State and I think it was February of 1970,

14:22.360 --> 14:28.707
and spoke to our state convention. And he said, I 
was in the back of the room, and I heard you give your

14:29.728 --> 14:34.734
presentation. He said, I have followed your 
career ever since. And he said, I asked one or two

14:39.559 --> 14:47.307
people, and he said, I was looking for someone 
young that could give it the vigor and the vision.

14:47.928 --> 14:50.511
And he said, that's how I got on it. to where I wanted 
you to come and do this program. So that's how we got

14:55.056 --> 14:56.097
there. And you were there how long? We were there 
eight years. As you look back on being a part of

14:59.281 --> 15:09.675
starting a new institution, really, what were the 
most important decisions that y'all made? I don't

15:11.097 --> 15:14.642
think there's any question what the most 
important decisions that we made were decisions

15:15.095 --> 15:23.411
related to the people that we recruited, not only 
our leadership, but also our own faculty. And the

15:23.431 --> 15:36.816
great advantage was that we had no deadwood, we had 
no history, we had no baggage that was behind us, so

15:23.431 --> 15:36.816
that we were able to select a leadership team and a 
faculty from across the whole country. And when we

15:39.158 --> 15:47.852
brought them in there, we told them what our 
philosophy would be of teaching, what our

15:39.158 --> 15:47.852
philosophy would be on student relations, what 
our philosophy would be on service to the state

15:48.237 --> 15:53.684
profession. And if that was not what they agreed 
to, that was not the place for them. And it was an

15:59.111 --> 16:01.274
exciting time. I got to recruit 25 faculty in my own 
department. I was also in charge of building the

16:05.920 --> 16:10.887
whole facilities, which was five and a half acres 
under roof. And at my young age, that was, oh man,

16:11.407 --> 16:16.458
that was so much fun. And to be given that 
opportunity. And I recruited, in part because of

16:19.044 --> 16:24.977
my young age, a very young faculty. My belief 
system was that I wanted to look for young budding

16:25.244 --> 16:37.423
stars, rose buds blossoming open, and bring them 
in there and give them the opportunity to excel.

16:38.544 --> 16:43.472
And it's amazing the number of those people who are 
still there. In terms of size, enrollment and

16:43.790 --> 16:52.680
faculty, when it got into full operation, how did 
it compare, say, with A&M? We took 128 students at

16:52.740 --> 16:56.444
A&M and we took 80 there. Okay. So it was about 
three-fourths the size. But for that size state,

17:00.469 --> 17:05.274
that was an adequate number. Is there anything 
that you all did that in hindsight if you had to do

17:05.294 --> 17:10.560
over again you'd change, you wouldn't do? 
Anything you learned negatively? not really I

17:13.878 --> 17:39.126
think probably if you were to ask all of us on the 
leadership team we probably would have done most

17:13.878 --> 17:39.126
everything the same way that we did it because we 
had an advantage we had a Dean who that was his third

17:13.878 --> 17:39.126
Dean ship so he pretty well knew the kinds of things 
that needed to be done He was a tremendous

17:39.815 --> 17:45.102
administrator and a tremendous statesman. Now, 
where did I know of him? He was dean at A&M. Oh. He

17:49.548 --> 17:51.271
preceded Al Price. Okay, okay, all right. And 
having been dean at Texas A&M and then dean at

17:52.953 --> 18:07.493
Michigan State, I think he served a total time on 
faculty at A&M of 17 years, including part-time as

17:52.953 --> 18:07.493
dean, and then 17 years at Michigan State. and then 
became dean of the new program there. What were the

18:12.367 --> 18:20.198
key

18:12.367 --> 18:20.198
issues, problems, needs of a department head? 
Well, I want to tell you that the key needs there

18:21.399 --> 18:26.786
ultimately wound up to be financial needs. That is 
not a wealthy state. we would oftentimes find

18:31.418 --> 18:58.843
ourselves after the honeymoon was over about the 
first three years they were on an annual

18:31.418 --> 18:58.843
legislative session and it seemed like that we 
were just always doing budgets and legislative

18:31.418 --> 18:58.843
things so the biggest challenge I think that we had 
quite frankly was the financial support of the

18:31.418 --> 18:58.843
institution and that program and we rode out the 
honeymoon for the period of time, but then you

18:59.195 --> 19:03.882
begin to be looked at like all the other programs. I 
think one of the other great challenges of a

19:05.184 --> 19:14.678
department head is that you're somewhat in 
between the higher administration and the

19:05.184 --> 19:14.678
faculty. And in one sense, you represent your 
faculty to the upper administration, and in

19:15.620 --> 19:24.413
another sense, you represent the upper 
administration back to the faculty. But for a

19:25.094 --> 19:28.459
learning process and to me an essential 
qualification for anyone that would go at a higher

19:29.165 --> 19:56.623
level than academic administration they need to 
have worked in a department head role because

19:29.165 --> 19:56.623
that's where the academics the students all meet 
the whole institutional administration before

19:29.165 --> 19:56.623
you went up there did you turn to any department 
head here for advice i talked to a number and i

19:29.165 --> 19:56.623
particularly talked to the clinical department 
heads about the challenges, the recruitment of

19:57.262 --> 20:07.235
faculty, the different things that they thought 
that I might be facing that I would need. They all

20:07.355 --> 20:13.062
looked at it as a great opportunity for me because 
they knew my interest in leadership. And I knew

20:14.464 --> 20:25.378
that I was making a great transition in my own 
career from having here at A&M had the opportunity

20:14.464 --> 20:25.378
to travel worldwide almost and give 
presentations in scientific papers. Now I was

20:29.615 --> 20:41.765
going to be coming at a young age of only 32 over into 
the arena of administration where a lot of the

20:29.615 --> 20:41.765
accomplishments would no longer be on my academic 
resume. I would have to be dependent upon the

20:42.246 --> 20:46.109
accomplishments of the people that I led. So I 
realized that early, and that was a part of, I

20:46.169 --> 20:55.517
think, being able to lead those people in an 
effective way. that I understood that from the

20:56.408 --> 21:13.387
front end, and I wanted them to understand that, 
that I was concerned and supportive of the mission

20:56.408 --> 21:13.387
that we had to accomplish, but at the same time, I 
wanted them to be able to excel in their own

20:56.408 --> 21:13.387
achievements. And was your title department head 
or chairman? Yeah, it was department head, and I

21:18.553 --> 21:23.479
was promoted to full professor with tenure. Okay. 
As department head, how much did you feel you

21:25.094 --> 21:36.614
should automatically be bound by the majority 
opinion of the department compared to your good

21:25.094 --> 21:36.614
judgment? That's an interesting question 
because in a faculty meeting, the first faculty

21:36.975 --> 21:47.914
meeting with all the faculty after I had 
recruited, I told them, I said, I want us to have as

21:48.586 --> 22:10.476
much discussion and I will be as democratic as I can 
but you'll have to know right now that I am held

21:48.586 --> 22:10.476
accountable and I'm going to make the final 
decision if I go against what you as a group believe

21:48.586 --> 22:10.476
I'm going to tell you why and I'm going to give you my 
judgment decision of why I'm making it that way But

22:11.587 --> 22:14.632
it was rare that we disagreed for another reason. 
We had recruited them to what we wanted to do. So I

22:17.998 --> 22:22.566
didn't have somebody that I inherited that was 
disgruntled or dissatisfied. Do you remember any

22:23.367 --> 22:30.179
critical decision where there was some

22:23.367 --> 22:30.179
disagreement? Yeah, I do. And I remember one 
specific instance where we had a search committee

22:32.900 --> 22:41.492
that selected an individual for a specialty area. 
And this man was board certified, probably the

22:42.313 --> 22:50.304
most qualified individual in America for that 
particular specialty. And in my gut, I did not feel

22:51.546 --> 22:56.913
that that was the person I wanted. And I let their 
decision be accepted, I later had to terminate

23:00.153 --> 23:04.720
that person. He was an explosion waiting to 
happen. He was not tenured? No. So you didn't have

23:12.271 --> 23:16.276
to go through the hearing or anything like that? 
No, thank goodness. And life in Knoxville

23:18.199 --> 23:22.245
compared to here? Life in Knoxville compared to 
here was quite a contrast because Knoxville is a

23:22.495 --> 23:32.730
city of 200,000 plus it had a double interstate 
Running through the center of the city. It's in the

23:33.231 --> 23:41.803
mountainous terrain So you only had limited 
number of traffic arteries and being a country boy

23:33.231 --> 23:41.803
and living in Bryan College Station I was not used 
to to the kinds of traffic issues that we had to deal

23:42.239 --> 23:45.124
with. That was different people-wise, very 
similar. Another thing that was different

23:48.951 --> 23:57.987
though, we had the four seasons of the year and 
beautiful areas in the spring and particularly

23:48.951 --> 23:57.987
the fall with the fall leaf color. And we 
thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a wonderful place to

24:00.171 --> 24:01.875
live. And now what was the image of the profession 
of veterinary medicine and its importance in that

24:02.377 --> 24:10.216
state compared to Texas? It was not as advanced in 
that state, in part because probably It was a more

24:14.808 --> 24:18.052
rural state than Texas. And I think that the income 
levels were higher in Texas, particularly with

24:19.053 --> 24:33.951
our major cities, so that veterinary medicine 
probably was at a little higher sophisticated

24:19.053 --> 24:33.951
level in Texas than it was there. But we elevated 
that immediately because we knew that that would

24:35.313 --> 24:40.579
be one of our missions And with the dean being a 
consummate professional and having a

24:40.964 --> 24:52.058
professional image, he was able to do that 
starting at the state legislative level and all

24:40.964 --> 24:52.058
the way down. And we did it through the university. 
And we gained quick acceptance and great respect

24:53.941 --> 24:59.568
in a hurry. All right. And then you come back to A&M 
when? Well, that's interesting because I was

25:04.054 --> 25:09.621
invited to come back to A&M after I'd only been 
there two years. And to take the large medicine, I

25:09.871 --> 25:19.760
mean, the department, which was very large, of 
medicine and surgery and break it into two

25:09.871 --> 25:19.760
departments. One would be large animal medicine 
surgery, the other would be small animal medicine

25:20.761 --> 25:24.465
and surgery. And I would be given the opportunity 
to build a complete new small animal hospital. And

25:31.972 --> 25:35.936
I can tell you that my heart was to come home. Our 
families lived here. I mean, I loved A&M with all of

25:38.930 --> 25:41.312
my heart. I wanted to come back here. This is a 
well-funded program. They had finances. They had

25:46.177 --> 25:47.158
resources. But I couldn't do it and be a person of 
integrity and character because I had been given a

25:48.679 --> 25:59.309
trust and a responsibility to help build 
something there. And I felt that I owed them at

26:00.110 --> 26:03.694
least five or six years. But I had a confidence in my 
heart that at the right time that something would

26:07.718 --> 26:13.647
open up for me to come to A&M. And after we'd been 
there seven years, it was announced that the

26:13.667 --> 26:27.209
associate dean for academic programs, who at the 
time was Wallace Bay, was going to retire a year in

26:13.667 --> 26:27.209
advance and they were going to start searching. 
Well, I just began to feel that there was a

26:28.371 --> 26:35.582
confidence that that was going to open up for me. 
And I knew they'd have to go through this big search

26:36.119 --> 26:40.043
process, which they did. I came. I went through the 
interview. I interviewed with everybody you can

26:42.787 --> 26:47.972
dream of and made a presentation to the faculty. 
And one part of the presentation was crucial

26:48.032 --> 26:58.905
because A&M was the College of Veterinary 
Medicine and then moving from the three-year

26:48.032 --> 26:58.905
curriculum back to a four. Well, I had just been a 
part of developing a brand new four-year

26:59.526 --> 27:03.510
curriculum. Plus, I had been a graduate of the 
three-year and had taught on the three-year. So I

27:09.046 --> 27:20.316
geared my presentation to what I thought would be a 
creative concept of moving to that and what I felt

27:09.046 --> 27:20.316
were the academic and student responsibilities 
of the position. And I was offered the position

27:21.517 --> 27:27.142
within a few weeks after I interviewed. And I had 
already, in eight years, I had done what I believed

27:28.082 --> 27:33.447
I could do there Plus, I'm one of those people that 
every five to six years, I need a new challenge. And

27:38.379 --> 27:39.922
this would have been a great challenge. It was 
another advancement for me. And quite clearly, it

27:42.487 --> 27:44.431
was coming home. All right, now you had met this 
dean that was here before you left. Wasn't he here?

27:51.837 --> 27:58.623
Yes, but only for I think a few months before I left 
the University of Tennessee. So I really did not

27:58.904 --> 28:04.609
know him except through the eight years at the 
University of Tennessee. I'd always been at the

28:04.629 --> 28:07.412
national meetings and I had met him. I'd gone to the 
A&M alumni reception and had gotten to know what a

28:07.432 --> 28:13.978
fine gentleman that he was. And as far as you know, 
was he a factor in making the final decision? I'm

28:19.512 --> 28:21.154
certain it was his decision. The search 
committee, I know, made their recommendation and

28:21.214 --> 28:28.003
then it was, I'm sure, his decision. His 
consultation, probably with you, I don't know

28:28.123 --> 28:36.394
whether you were still here at the time, but I will 
tell you one thing. When I left here to go to the

28:38.757 --> 28:47.308
University of Tennessee, a part of this process, 
you may not remember this, But you had an exit

28:47.609 --> 28:50.592
interview with people who left here. And I 
remember you were officed over in the Teague

28:51.493 --> 28:55.536
building. And you asked me to come over and talk to 
you, which I did. And I never forgot that. That

29:01.962 --> 29:14.494
meant a lot to me about the administration's 
concern and just interest in where their faculty

29:01.962 --> 29:14.494
members were going. To me, any time a faculty 
member left here and went to another university in

29:14.913 --> 29:21.588
an advancement, that was really a compliment to 
A&M. And I later had to remind deans and department

29:23.132 --> 29:25.878
heads of that. Among things that I believed in then 
and still do, see, I would try to have for every

29:33.475 --> 29:42.405
prospective faculty member from off campus, I 
would say to the search department or whatever it

29:33.475 --> 29:42.405
might be, give me a half hour. Under no 
circumstance will I try to investigate and judge

29:43.046 --> 29:48.272
the person. I want to try to tell them as candidly 
and as honestly as I can what this institution is

29:48.292 --> 29:56.462
and what it hopes to become. They may not like what 
we are. They may not. Then the other one was to try to

29:59.967 --> 30:14.002
find out, as tactfully as I could, is there 
anything that is a factor in this person's leaving

29:59.967 --> 30:14.002
that we maybe need to know about that I might learn. 
In those initial interviews, I discovered one guy

30:19.375 --> 30:22.859
I mentioned he had his Ph.D. from Virginia. I 
mentioned going over to work, and I gave the name of

30:23.479 --> 30:28.304
the library. And I realized, you know, I'm Hunt, 
and I mentioned it. Oh, oh, oh, yes, yes. I thought,

30:33.730 --> 30:34.431
hmm. I then made up three people's names in his 
supposed area, and he knew them all well. I then

30:42.700 --> 30:45.162
called the department and I said, you need to 
check. Something didn't work. They called that

30:46.644 --> 30:48.606
department at Virginia. They had never heard of 
him. His resume was a fraud. Make believe I didn't

30:54.630 --> 30:56.613
know George Shelton well. Describe George 
Shelton. George Shelton was probably the most

30:59.437 --> 31:04.745
gracious human being I have ever worked with in my 
life. And George was a person who, when he gave you a

31:06.247 --> 31:12.737
responsibility, it was yours. I never will forget 
once I told George, I said, George, you're almost

31:14.540 --> 31:23.525
too nice to be a dean.

31:27.937 --> 31:30.203
To never ruffle the feathers of anyone.
