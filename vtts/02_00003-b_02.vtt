00:02.883 --> 00:16.160
a car would stop, the number one guy would go running up and say, going to Houston or wherever, and the guy would say, get in, and he'd say, is there room for anyone else?

00:17.322 --> 00:23.230
And ask him, and he would say either yes or no, and if, how many, sir?

00:23.250 --> 00:27.776
And that's the number that he would call up if there were any.

00:27.796 --> 00:31.000
And you always,

00:32.043 --> 00:41.633
tried to ask them, tell them where you were going and ask them somewhere or another where they were going because you didn't want to get out in some of these towns.

00:42.153 --> 00:46.838
For instance, if you're headed north, you did not want out in Calvert.

00:46.858 --> 00:58.810
And you would, if you were going to Dallas, there were two ways to go, one up through Calvert and so on.

01:00.494 --> 01:04.718
And the other one was to go over to Highway 75, either Madisonville or Buffalo.

01:06.960 --> 01:11.244
And one time over there, I caught a ride in Accord automobile.

01:12.385 --> 01:17.210
Yes, sir, Accord, all the way to Dallas.

01:17.230 --> 01:22.635
And that was the fanciest car that I had ever seen and probably ever will see, ride in.

01:24.216 --> 01:30.062
But you would essentially, if the person stopped,

01:31.358 --> 01:41.370
And if he was going where, trying to go, or anyone else in the group was trying to go, you went with them regardless of the car.

01:42.351 --> 01:45.695
It wasn't, you know, I don't want to ride in that old Ford.

01:45.715 --> 01:47.778
I want a Buick or whatever.

01:48.859 --> 01:55.047
I don't know whether anyone ever took advantage of that or not, but that was not the custom.

01:56.689 --> 02:00.353
And you would always wear your uniform.

02:02.307 --> 02:06.273
People really had no qualms of picking up Aggies at all.

02:07.755 --> 02:14.625
And I met some interesting people and helpful people.

02:16.428 --> 02:25.742
And going to Houston one time, I had a guy took me to the same block that my brother lived in where I was going.

02:25.762 --> 02:29.327
And, you know, just some good people.

02:29.813 --> 02:36.288
The Aggies were helpful if anything happened, a flat tire or anything, they would get out and help.

02:37.070 --> 02:43.705
And he simply changed the tire for him, for the person.

02:45.119 --> 02:53.889
Very respectful of any women that were in the automobile, whether they were adult women or young girls or whatever.

02:56.292 --> 02:58.915
We were just on your P's and Q's with those people.

02:59.296 --> 03:03.200
Did you ever hear of any bad experiences in Aggie head hitchhiking?

03:06.865 --> 03:08.587
Not really bad.

03:09.848 --> 03:13.152
Someone told me one time that one guy made the

03:14.262 --> 03:15.664
sexual advances toward him.

03:16.445 --> 03:22.193
But I don't know what happened, but nothing.

03:23.635 --> 03:27.360
The guy apparently backed off.

03:27.840 --> 03:31.305
Where in Dallas was the place to catch a ride coming south?

03:33.348 --> 03:33.768
I don't know.

03:33.828 --> 03:36.212
I didn't go to Dallas.

03:36.232 --> 03:38.835
Where'd you get off to go to Forney?

03:39.743 --> 03:43.069
Oh, you were saying coming south.

03:43.670 --> 03:44.251
That's what I mean.

03:44.411 --> 03:44.732
Okay.

03:45.072 --> 03:59.558
But going in, I would go on into the inside of town and catch a streetcar and go out on, but coming south, no, my folks would take me over and put me off in Highway 75 in

04:03.014 --> 04:03.996
Wilmer or Hutchins.

04:04.036 --> 04:05.358
I can't remember which one.

04:05.398 --> 04:06.660
Not in Dallas.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.781
That's my only point.

04:08.182 --> 04:09.364
Oh, okay.

04:10.045 --> 04:16.315
Because I'm assuming there must have been a magic location for Aggies to catch rides somewhere in downtown Dallas.

04:16.335 --> 04:16.515
Oh, yeah.

04:16.535 --> 04:26.270
I'm sure that there was, but I just... Normally, what was the time it took for you to get back and forth hitchhiking from here to Forney?

04:29.034 --> 04:29.455
Half day?

04:30.597 --> 04:31.418
Four or five hours.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.342
Not much longer than it takes to drive now.

04:37.164 --> 04:42.610
Let's see, student organizations, singing cadets, were they around then?

04:43.991 --> 04:47.295
Yeah, there were some, but not like it is now.

04:49.577 --> 04:53.061
I hear you coughing in here, probably getting dry.

04:54.182 --> 04:56.424
What about the Aggie Band?

04:57.125 --> 05:00.088
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

05:03.241 --> 05:07.507
There was another band.

05:12.914 --> 05:13.776
Can I look a minute?

05:14.977 --> 05:15.118
Mm-hmm.

05:15.138 --> 05:16.199
You want to cut it off a minute?

05:16.219 --> 05:18.222
Let me kind of look.

05:19.283 --> 05:20.946
Go ahead.

05:20.986 --> 05:32.742
You had the, in the student organization, you had to buy academic fields, and maybe one of the,

05:33.228 --> 05:46.815
Judging teams from the agriculture was gained a little more recognition, but most of them were just about equal and I know in the accounting society we would just gather and

05:48.280 --> 05:56.231
hear some discussion of a current event or change in some accounting policies or something like that.

05:56.251 --> 06:04.883
And the prestige was, I guess, would be the Ross Volunteers.

06:06.806 --> 06:10.771
They were highly recognized, highly visible.

06:12.674 --> 06:14.997
Was it hard to get in the RVs then?

06:16.512 --> 06:18.594
I guess so, I couldn't get, I didn't get in it.

06:19.576 --> 06:21.798
How about hometown clubs, did they exist then?

06:21.938 --> 06:24.301
Oh yes, I had hometown clubs.

06:25.382 --> 06:26.584
What purpose did they serve?

06:30.568 --> 06:35.514
I don't really see that they served much of a purpose.

06:35.914 --> 06:43.583
It was essentially a friendship type club and maybe

06:45.031 --> 07:12.709
some recruiting type benefits, but, and the same way they tied in with the Mother's Club, but I'm trying to look through here and find the band, I mean, not the Aggie band, entertainment band, a dance band, but I can't find it, but there was one,

07:16.030 --> 07:18.013
Seemed like Buck Wires was a part of it.

07:18.553 --> 07:25.923
I can't quite remember now, but there was a student band like that.

07:26.904 --> 07:30.409
Yell leaders, what did people think about the Yell leaders in those days?

07:30.429 --> 07:31.510
Was that high prestige?

07:31.771 --> 07:32.512
Oh yes.

07:34.314 --> 07:45.008
Buster Keaton and Foots Bland were our Yell leaders, and they were well recognized, well respected, and

07:45.562 --> 07:46.543
kind of looked up to.

07:47.504 --> 07:49.046
They were good guys.

07:49.066 --> 07:51.189
They were good positions.

07:53.031 --> 07:55.895
And senior boots.

07:55.915 --> 07:58.278
When, how, where, how much?

08:02.183 --> 08:05.968
Mine cost, I think, a little over $100.

08:06.208 --> 08:08.731
That was a lot.

08:12.977 --> 08:13.257
And

08:15.059 --> 08:25.473
I don't remember that we did what they now do of the juniors having them and hiding them in their closets or anything like that.

08:27.295 --> 08:41.134
When it came time to wear them, you just went out and bought them or somebody, you got them a hand-me-down from somebody else or whatever and went on from there.

08:43.527 --> 08:51.297
Yes, that was a big deal to get those senior boots and to get your Aggie ring.

08:51.497 --> 08:54.341
On the boots, where'd you get yours?

08:54.361 --> 08:54.801
Hollick's.

08:55.382 --> 08:55.983
Brand new.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.024
Yeah.

08:57.044 --> 08:59.407
Do you remember how you acquired that $100?

08:59.427 --> 09:11.442
Oh, I worked in the oil fields in the summertime and holidays and everything else.

09:13.683 --> 09:18.494
I worked for an Aggie who had been a yellow leader, Milo Abercrombie.

09:20.359 --> 09:28.358
And whenever I would go to Houston and wanted to work, I'd go out to the warehouse and my pay started then when I got to the warehouse, period.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.405
And if they didn't have a truck,

09:32.954 --> 09:34.857
I'd do some work around the yard or whatever.

09:35.698 --> 09:38.502
And 75 cents an hour.

09:39.664 --> 09:48.777
And I think my last year it was a dollar and a quarter an hour, which is an unheard of wage.

09:49.919 --> 09:53.044
And there were a couple of other aggies that worked there too.

09:54.526 --> 10:02.117
So by that time, and all of my brothers were,

10:04.595 --> 10:09.200
Well, not well off, but financially stable.

10:10.441 --> 10:15.346
And they would help with my tuition room and board.

10:16.648 --> 10:26.398
And they knew that I would, it would be nice to have boots, and that was not a problem of my paying for it.

10:26.418 --> 10:27.880
And let me just say another thing.

10:28.541 --> 10:33.606
I could have graduated at midterm of my senior year.

10:34.328 --> 10:42.055
But I had an advance contract, and my oldest brother would not listen to that.

10:42.075 --> 10:52.726
He said, no, you go on and finish that fifth year, get your commission, and go on from there, and we'll think nothing about it.

10:53.927 --> 11:02.395
And so I was, and I got,

11:04.754 --> 11:12.882
I became a battery commander my last year here and I got the cleaning concession for my battery.

11:14.243 --> 11:23.712
And so I had no competition and got all of my clothes cleaned for free and a commission on all the rest of it.

11:23.732 --> 11:27.675
Describe the responsibilities of being a battery commander.

11:32.340 --> 11:32.820
Well,

11:35.416 --> 11:45.728
The way I took it, and I mean this sincerely, that I was responsible for those freshmen.

11:45.748 --> 11:48.351
I didn't much look out for the other guys.

11:50.013 --> 11:54.939
I viewed my responsibility primarily as take care of the freshmen.

11:55.159 --> 12:02.908
I don't mean to keep them out of any hazing or anything like that, but, or at least no minor hazing.

12:03.462 --> 12:07.646
And if any of them were perturbed or anything, I'd go and talk with them.

12:08.627 --> 12:27.867
Buck Wires has stated, I don't know whether it's a fact or not, but he has stated that I could unpack a freshman's footlocker faster than he could pack it, trying to keep them here.

12:28.066 --> 12:48.195
Yeah, you were responsible for the orderliness, particularly in falling in and you're marching to meals and having an upperclassman there to go with them, march with them.

12:48.215 --> 12:56.908
And also to be around, if you're not in class, to be around

12:57.327 --> 12:58.768
when there was to be an inspection.

12:59.589 --> 13:25.714
I remember one time Colonel Beasley came inspecting for boards and my roommate Leland Beard was there too and I started him off across the hall in Spot Talbot's room and went on down that side and then came back to our room and in the meantime Leland had put the board out under the bushes.

13:26.403 --> 13:36.460
And, but also trying to follow the orders that came down.

13:36.860 --> 13:45.435
For instance, senior year, they repainted the water tower because it had all of the unit signs up there.

13:45.455 --> 13:48.219
And thou shalt not put any more signs up there.

13:49.782 --> 13:52.967
Two days later, 3rd headquarters battery field artillery up there.

13:54.213 --> 13:58.259
I don't, I did not try to find out who did it.

13:59.340 --> 14:00.883
I did not try to find out at all.

14:01.924 --> 14:08.333
And I did not, I was not questioned by people in the ROTC department either.

14:10.136 --> 14:16.525
But just the overall orderliness of your outfit and

14:19.593 --> 14:22.797
Just a freshman I took on.

14:22.817 --> 14:32.347
What about an example that you can recall that you're proud to describe of where you think maybe you made a difference in a young man's life?

14:36.712 --> 14:38.854
Someone had a problem and you helped him.

14:42.118 --> 14:48.705
There was, I believe his name was Fish Parker, was having some problems.

14:50.828 --> 14:55.873
I don't remember exactly how I helped him, but I do know that I talked with him.

14:57.916 --> 15:07.406
And then there was somebody else, I can't recall his name, who got homesick.

15:07.426 --> 15:13.733
And back in those days, you didn't go home much except on Thanksgiving.

15:15.274 --> 15:20.380
But I gave this kid a pass.

15:21.068 --> 15:33.366
I said, you are homesick, and I can't do anything about it, and I understand, or I don't know the words, but, and I just think you ought to go home, and I'll give you a pass.

15:33.426 --> 15:43.802
So he went home, and I don't think he came back until sometime Monday afternoon, but he came back, and that was all there was to it, and he stayed on.

15:46.094 --> 15:50.859
Did your footlocker get stolen as they now do?

15:52.701 --> 15:53.622
That didn't happen then?

15:53.742 --> 15:55.724
No, we didn't.

15:56.204 --> 15:57.526
Not in our outfit anyway.

15:57.746 --> 16:01.830
Do you remember any pranks that your outfit attempted to play on you?

16:10.659 --> 16:14.683
They hid my sword one time and

16:17.313 --> 16:19.716
stuffed toilet paper down in my boots.

16:21.918 --> 16:26.624
So, you know, and when you get in a hurry, it gets aggravating.

16:27.825 --> 16:35.374
And when you're due for a parade and you can't find your sword, you know.

16:37.797 --> 16:40.480
But just a couple, three of those like that.

16:41.261 --> 16:45.987
I'm sure that they rearranged my footlocker at times.

16:47.198 --> 16:48.399
burned out a light bulb.

16:50.081 --> 16:55.707
Do you remember anything about when you bought your senior ring?

16:58.450 --> 16:59.551
Was that a proud moment?

17:00.092 --> 17:11.704
Oh yes, very proud and that was the one that I took the extra money to be able to get it.

17:12.697 --> 17:16.164
That was more of a financial burden for me than the boots happened to be.

17:20.172 --> 17:23.118
But yeah, and wearing it properly.

17:24.941 --> 17:33.338
You know, we had to wear it with the numeral inside.

17:35.039 --> 17:39.086
you always made sure that you wore it like that.

17:39.106 --> 17:47.240
But just like this one, you know, a new one, although that one had a lot of dark coloring in it as opposed to this one.

17:47.260 --> 17:55.434
But I guess then the proud time really came when you could turn it around.

17:56.316 --> 17:57.538
And when could that be done?

17:57.778 --> 18:00.102
At graduation.

18:01.415 --> 18:05.759
And let me tell you a little bit of story also.

18:08.322 --> 18:14.288
These days, kids want to take 12, 15 hours a semester maybe.

18:16.530 --> 18:29.683
Really, you ought to go back and look at the catalog for 1936 for two degrees in engineering, five-year program.

18:32.887 --> 18:44.820
I believe that the sophomore year, you're required to take 22 hours to include calculus and physics and chemistry.

18:44.840 --> 18:51.748
And a kid across the hall from me, Leland Beard, later my roommate was in that program.

18:51.828 --> 19:02.640
And that kid studied and after his freshman year, I don't think he ever turned out the lights before 11 o'clock.

19:03.937 --> 19:13.610
And then when, and it required summer camp for some of those.

19:15.533 --> 19:19.658
And that conflicted with ROTC summer camp.

19:19.678 --> 19:26.608
And Levalon Beard had been our first sergeant his fourth year, you know, his junior year in ROTC.

19:27.589 --> 19:29.792
And so he should have been battery commander.

19:30.532 --> 19:37.459
But he couldn't go to summer camp for OOTC because engineering summer camps took precedent.

19:37.479 --> 19:43.444
So going to graduation, he goes across the stages to get two degrees.

19:45.246 --> 19:49.750
And the first time he goes across and gets a tube, it's blank, nothing in it.

19:51.332 --> 19:58.519
Goes across the stage the second time for a second degree, blank, nothing in it.

19:58.539 --> 20:00.100
And so you talk about a boy that,

20:00.907 --> 20:02.369
hurried around after that.

20:02.750 --> 20:08.437
He went over and, you haven't been to summer camp or OTC.

20:09.439 --> 20:10.841
You can't get a degree yet.

20:12.803 --> 20:13.725
It was just that simple.

20:15.527 --> 20:18.652
But, you know, five years, two degrees.

20:20.274 --> 20:22.016
He did not fail a course at all.

20:22.076 --> 20:28.365
I doubt that he even made anything less than a C because he was a good student, dedicated student.

20:28.852 --> 20:32.436
But the oil cost and nothing.

20:32.456 --> 20:33.197
Empty tubes.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.521
How much did the ring cost?

20:36.541 --> 20:37.022
Do you remember?

20:37.863 --> 20:38.664
No, I don't remember.

20:39.785 --> 20:45.672
Now, did you buy the ring and the boots at about the same time?

20:45.692 --> 20:47.154
No, I bought the ring before the boots.

20:49.176 --> 20:55.163
Because I could have graduated, could have graduated in January.

20:55.565 --> 20:57.348
of that fifth year.

20:57.869 --> 21:07.324
Do you have any ring stories to share about losing or somebody spotting it at some certain place or somebody noticing you had an Aggie ring on?

21:08.145 --> 21:19.102
I guess the best story is fairly recent.

21:19.883 --> 21:22.888
Her daughter married an Aggie, an architect.

21:24.269 --> 21:29.200
And they were up in, lived up in New Haven, Connecticut, and we went up there to visit them.

21:31.344 --> 21:35.814
This was after her granddaughter was born, and so it had been probably 1971.

21:35.995 --> 21:41.687
And we took off for the weekend driving up

21:43.237 --> 21:49.865
From New Haven, you cross, and this is hard for a Texan to understand, really.

21:49.885 --> 22:02.862
Drove across Connecticut, drove across Massachusetts, and drove up into Vermont a third of the way and spent the night, and you know, we didn't take off until after lunch, and you cross two states and so on.

22:03.343 --> 22:10.712
But we stopped in Massachusetts at a restored house, some restored houses.

22:11.283 --> 22:22.238
And some of the people around there saw Texas license plate and wanted to know where we were from and College Station and where's that Texas A&M.

22:22.579 --> 22:25.984
Oh, there's an Aggie working over here at one of these places.

22:26.885 --> 22:33.274
So we went over there and knocked on the door or the lady that was in charge.

22:33.710 --> 22:50.686
and they'd given us a name and we gave her his name and so he came down in a few minutes and she was still there and son-in-law held up his ring and I held up my ring and then the kid held up his ring.

22:50.706 --> 22:56.252
And in a few minutes the lady came up, can I ask what is all of that business about holding up your hands?

22:57.132 --> 23:00.436
I said, the lady is not holding up her hands, it's showing a ring of each other.

23:00.776 --> 23:03.058
Each of us is from Texas A&M University.

23:03.477 --> 23:08.004
Oh, you know, it was all right, but she could not understand that.

23:08.124 --> 23:09.707
And, you know.

23:09.727 --> 23:11.409
Now, I noticed you were wearing a new ring.

23:11.589 --> 23:12.471
What happened to your old one?

23:14.274 --> 23:15.315
I lost it.

23:15.335 --> 23:17.458
Oh, okay.

23:17.478 --> 23:18.540
Only a few years ago.

23:19.582 --> 23:26.352
And I said to myself for a period of time that, well, a new ring just won't be the same.

23:26.412 --> 23:30.278
And it's not, because the old ring had gone with me through

23:31.000 --> 23:33.743
World War II and through Korea and whatever.

23:33.903 --> 23:39.350
And, but some way or another, I lost it.

23:39.390 --> 23:44.596
I just realized one morning sometime that I didn't have it on and I did without it.

23:44.676 --> 23:57.110
And so yes, I ordered me another one and I picked it up this fall, the same time that the others picked theirs up, November the 18th, the day of the bonfire tragedy.

23:58.272 --> 23:59.353
And so that,

24:01.223 --> 24:02.745
That will remain with me.

24:02.765 --> 24:04.408
You got that one this year?

24:04.428 --> 24:05.710
That one is this year.

24:06.531 --> 24:10.557
November the 18th, 1999, the day of the bonfire tragedy.

24:10.877 --> 24:12.600
All right, now you're mentioning bonfire.

24:12.780 --> 24:20.451
What was bonfire like when you were an undergraduate?

24:20.471 --> 24:24.497
People would just go out and gather up whatever.

24:25.996 --> 24:33.967
logs or lumber and throw it on it, essentially just throw it out there.

24:35.328 --> 24:41.437
And somebody would try to steal somebody's outhouse and put it up on top some way.

24:41.537 --> 24:45.021
I was never there when they were doing that.

24:45.101 --> 24:47.785
I don't know how they would do that.

24:48.743 --> 25:05.605
I'm sure it's just manpower would get it up to essentially the top, and it was, you would kind of detail some freshmen to go out and get,

25:06.445 --> 25:12.873
If you saw a pile of an old lumber somewhere, you would detail some freshmen to go get it and bring it in.

25:13.434 --> 25:18.220
Do you remember as a freshman participating in that?

25:18.240 --> 25:19.602
To some degree like that.

25:19.782 --> 25:24.649
About how much effort do you remember, how many hours do you remember you put in?

25:26.271 --> 25:27.953
Was it a day or two or a month or two?

25:28.033 --> 25:31.137
Oh no, probably a couple of hours, a couple of days.

25:31.994 --> 25:34.478
Probably not more than four hours, probably.

25:35.079 --> 25:37.683
It was not organized at all like it is now.

25:38.043 --> 25:40.367
And it was held on the drill field.

25:40.387 --> 25:42.570
Oh, yeah.

25:42.590 --> 25:45.775
And was the night before the Texas game?

25:46.536 --> 25:48.039
Yeah.

25:48.059 --> 25:49.581
Yeah.

25:49.601 --> 25:50.783
Or two nights before.

25:50.803 --> 25:53.487
If it was now a 10 game.

25:54.108 --> 25:59.436
What about, what do you remember about silver taps for your undergraduate years?

26:01.930 --> 26:08.673
They were, even freshmen stayed up.

26:08.693 --> 26:14.151
And very solemn, very quiet.

26:16.004 --> 26:28.580
You would go with some friends from your outfit, but there was no organized unit attendance.

26:28.600 --> 26:38.492
But you would go with some friends and very, very little talking, even going over to it.

26:38.512 --> 26:45.100
You would just essentially walk together and be there and

26:48.252 --> 26:53.317
Have some thoughts and do an about-face and return home.

26:54.999 --> 27:00.284
Was there any game, did y'all do any pranks or act silly after it was over?

27:00.564 --> 27:01.805
No.

27:01.825 --> 27:07.190
No, the entire ceremony was just, you know.

27:07.210 --> 27:09.653
Do you remember Aggie Muster as an undergraduate?

27:10.013 --> 27:12.716
No.

27:12.736 --> 27:16.099
I didn't, they may have had them, but

27:16.805 --> 27:18.387
I don't remember them as such, no.

27:18.968 --> 27:26.280
I have the impression so far that the muster held on Corregidor changed musters forever.

27:27.101 --> 27:29.565
That World War II had a strong effect on them.

27:29.585 --> 27:35.094
And then the first muster back here in 1946.

27:37.177 --> 27:40.382
And that was five years for us.

27:41.948 --> 27:44.752
And we met at the Bolton House on campus.

27:44.792 --> 27:45.673
Were you here for that?

27:45.873 --> 27:46.114
Yes.

27:46.494 --> 27:47.596
Oh, yes.

27:47.616 --> 27:48.998
Describe that.

27:49.759 --> 28:02.556
Oh, that was a joyous reunion and sad because you would say, well, what about so-and-so?

28:03.127 --> 28:03.868
He didn't make it.

28:03.888 --> 28:07.131
He was killed in Germany or whatever.

28:08.031 --> 28:08.772
And what is it?

28:09.353 --> 28:15.058
I think 96 names of my classmates on the memorial plaque down there.

28:15.078 --> 28:23.445
But it was a very, very happy time, but at the same time sad, but gathering together.

28:23.605 --> 28:32.053
And Preston had invited us to their house on campus.

28:33.282 --> 28:37.648
on the corner of where that parking garage is by Rudder.

28:38.389 --> 28:39.811
Preston Bolton?

28:39.851 --> 28:42.535
Preston Bolton, yeah.

28:46.160 --> 28:56.135
And we brought kids and everything else and went over to Kyle Field and Eisenhower, was he the one here?

28:57.136 --> 28:58.598
I think that's who it was.

29:04.484 --> 29:18.506
I don't remember then, but I do know now that if I attended that again, I would be crying.

29:18.526 --> 29:27.319
I don't remember that I cried at that time because there were just a certain

29:28.885 --> 29:39.185
stillness within me and would not allow it then, but that's gone now.

29:39.205 --> 29:41.669
And there was a huge crowd, wasn't there?

29:41.689 --> 29:42.591
Oh, yes.

29:42.841 --> 29:47.068
Ours was the fifth, but it didn't make any difference.

29:48.971 --> 29:53.418
Everybody came from everywhere that knew anything about it being there.

29:55.221 --> 30:01.911
For many of us, it was the first time that we had seen each other since graduation or whatever, unless we happened to be in the same outfit.

30:03.814 --> 30:06.098
Yes, a huge crowd.

30:06.078 --> 30:23.186
Alright, as you graduate in the spring of 41, as the months go on from September, fall of 39 until you graduate, did you and your buddies talk about what was happening overseas?

30:23.526 --> 30:30.718
Oh yes, it was discussed in ROTC almost on a weekly basis and

30:32.150 --> 30:37.695
I don't remember so much that was in 39-40, but 40-41, yes, specifically.

30:39.057 --> 31:01.178
And it was, and we knew that in ROTC that we would have a, and having a contract, that we would be involved in some military service some way, sooner or later.

31:03.554 --> 31:15.543
And they finally came out and said, I don't remember the exact nature of it, but you could sign up to go now or later.

31:15.564 --> 31:21.478
And in the field artillery, you could,

31:23.045 --> 31:28.175
sign up for even request certain classes to be held up at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

31:28.195 --> 31:33.445
They were starting the classes and they were held on a, started on a weekly basis and there were three-month courses.

31:34.788 --> 31:43.365
And as I kind of remember, the first class that we could sign up for started on, was class number 12.

31:44.611 --> 31:47.280
And my first priority was class number 12.

31:47.320 --> 31:49.508
My second priority was class number 13.

31:49.568 --> 31:51.956
And my third priority was class number 14.

31:51.996 --> 31:53.421
And I got class number 14.

31:54.244 --> 31:55.448
But I also had put in.
