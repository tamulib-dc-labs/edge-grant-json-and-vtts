00:09.363 --> 00:23.941
This is an interview with Mr. Bob Kuhn by Syed 
Haider on April 25, 1989, concerning the Vietnam

00:09.363 --> 00:23.941
War. In the interest of accumulating knowledge 
about the war, I'm going to donate this tape to the

00:26.424 --> 00:36.557
Texas A&M Oral History Collection in the 
University Archives. Is that all right with you?

00:39.468 --> 00:47.479
Yes.

00:47.499 --> 00:55.269
Mr. Kuhn, can you tell us how and why you joined the 
military? Can you include a brief sketch of

00:57.432 --> 01:02.999
military career before Vietnam?

01:05.763 --> 01:08.226
Oh, I joined the Army and, uh, December 6, 1960,

01:09.590 --> 01:14.677
I was drafted. I volunteered my draft. I was 
looking to just take two years and get back out. But

01:22.889 --> 01:28.757
after I had served about a year, I decided to make 
the military my career.

01:32.842 --> 01:36.087
Can you tell us something about where you went to 
college? I've only got a few credits in college and

01:36.742 --> 01:39.926
stuff. When I was in the military, I went to school 
and stuff like this because I needed this to get my

01:40.746 --> 01:47.814
promotion to my next higher grade. So I went to NCO 
Academy, different type of school, a few credit

01:47.834 --> 01:53.981
hours here and there, but no college.

01:56.664 --> 01:58.506
When did you first go to Vietnam? The first time I 
arrived in Vietnam was in May of 65, the 173rd.

02:08.703 --> 02:18.414
in Okinawa, was ordered to move from Okinawa to 
Vietnam as an action force. But after a few months

02:18.434 --> 02:25.723
there, Johnson decided to make the 173rd a 
permanent change of station. And we were

02:25.823 --> 02:30.168
stationed in Vietnam. But I had orders to come back 
home in August. So I came back in August of 65,

02:35.298 --> 02:49.584
served about a year in 82nd Airborne, and turned 
around and went right back to Okinawa in 67.

02:51.167 --> 02:59.061
I arrived back in Vietnam in February of 67 as a 
special forces advisory team, what they called a

02:51.167 --> 02:59.061
Bravo team. building Spatial Forces A camps for 
the Spatial Forces from north to south. That was

03:06.338 --> 03:10.864
from the north end of Vietnam to the south end of 
Vietnam. When I arrived in Vietnam, I started at

03:10.884 --> 03:17.633
the north end building Spatial Forces camp and 
airstrips and things like this for the Spatial

03:10.884 --> 03:17.633
Forces. Then I moved from there to Canto to build a 
floating camp that we built. And then we moved from

03:25.143 --> 03:27.867
there to... another camp, and we built a wall for 
during the floods in the Mekong that the camp would

03:28.387 --> 03:36.800
not be flooded. Then I left Vietnam then for, I 
served about eight months. I came back in August

03:42.869 --> 03:54.546
again, and I left Okinawa in 69 and served about 
another year back in the States with the 82nd

03:42.869 --> 03:54.546
because I've been a paratrooper. I turned around 
and went right back to Vietnam. This time it was an

03:57.880 --> 04:05.612
actual tour in Vietnam because the other times 
that I was there was considered as a TDY tour, and my

03:57.880 --> 04:05.612
time there did not count. So this time that I was 
going back in 60, in 71, was an actual Vietnam

04:06.834 --> 04:15.527
assignment from the government branch. Okay, 
then I served a year. That was my years, what we had

04:17.430 --> 04:20.955
to serve in a combat zone.

04:24.412 --> 04:36.584
When you went to Vietnam the second time, did you 
notice a change in the attitude of the American

04:24.412 --> 04:36.584
forces there from their attitude when you first 
were there? I

04:36.604 --> 04:40.647
think it was about the same. It was a little bit 
different than most of the people that was there. I

04:45.472 --> 04:53.980
guess the people, once that they got accepted, the 
military especially, they just accepted it as a

04:45.472 --> 04:53.980
tour. So they accepted their job in being in the 
military as a duty. There was maybe some that

04:57.572 --> 05:01.938
wasn't, but most of the time I didn't meet people 
that objected for being there. And some in cases,

05:02.338 --> 05:10.630
we had people stay three and four years as 
volunteers to stay there. So in other words, some

05:10.670 --> 05:15.056
people liked it and some people didn't. What do you 
believe was the reason for American involvement

05:15.076 --> 05:18.861
in Vietnam? The government, I think, asked after 
France had lost to them. And we also had advisory

05:28.232 --> 05:44.317
there starting in 65, or long before the 173rd was 
moved there, that we had advisories and MACV units

05:28.232 --> 05:44.317
there advising the Vietnamese troops and 
government about the war. And then 65 was when

05:44.618 --> 05:51.709
Johnson moved, actually put American forces in 
Vietnam.

05:55.857 --> 06:00.382
Can you reflect on some of the problems you 
encountered while you were in Vietnam? For

06:00.923 --> 06:08.111
example, did you see people who had problems with 
abuse of drugs or alcohol? Yes, there was a lot of

06:08.591 --> 06:11.514
that going on. They had their little groups. Just 
like in your ethnic groups, even in Nam, they...

06:19.803 --> 06:26.934
You had your ethnic groups, your Puerto Ricans 
stuck together, your blacks stuck together, your

06:19.803 --> 06:26.934
potheads or your people that use drugs. Even in 
those groups, they mostly stuck together and done

06:27.074 --> 06:33.564
everything as their own ethnic groups. Because 
the type of job I had at the time then was not a combat

06:35.487 --> 06:39.553
MOS. It was a maintenance MOS. And so I stayed 
around in camp. So in other words, the people,

06:45.281 --> 06:49.067
mostly for what I seen in Nam at that time, was, 
except for in 67 when I was more in a combat type

06:49.486 --> 06:59.878
field, that the troops were mostly ethnic 
oriented. In other words, when the blacks would

06:59.898 --> 07:08.527
raise their hands, the Puerto Ricans had their own 
little things to do off of what the blacks had.

07:11.450 --> 07:12.912
They'd do this. And they'd do different things 
that, you know. There was a few white guys that

07:16.001 --> 07:32.705
could pick it up, but if they associated them 
within, because they were smoking pot or they were

07:16.001 --> 07:32.705
taking drugs, mostly that I know of, the big thing 
that a lot of the troops were doing was mostly

07:16.001 --> 07:32.705
smoking the pot. You could find a lot of these bags 
and things of pot around the buildings. Anything

07:37.392 --> 07:39.675
after payday, a lot of times they'd go buy it. And 
they'd smoke it. And that's how they stuck

07:41.823 --> 07:43.705
together. Like I said, most of them was just ethnic 
groups. So you did not associate yourself with

07:46.027 --> 07:50.231
other ethnic groups? I associated with them, but I 
was not part of them. In other words, my job as an NCO

07:52.773 --> 08:02.721
or a sergeant within the Army, I associated with 
them, but I was not part of their group because I

07:52.773 --> 08:02.721
could not be part of their group and be an NCO. 
Unless I wanted to go ahead and smoke the pot and be

08:02.741 --> 08:07.165
like them, then I could do it. Then you could be one 
of the fellas. For all the time that I was in Vietnam

08:09.541 --> 08:26.304
and stuff like this, I had no urge to take drugs or 
smoke the pot because I looked at it as a Christian

08:09.541 --> 08:26.304
and stuff like this, that it was not good for your 
body and things like this to be doing this. Plus, I

08:27.046 --> 08:32.774
wanted to come back from Vietnam a full person 
because you don't know what some of this stuff

08:27.046 --> 08:32.774
would do to your body. How do you think were the 
blacks treated in Vietnam? I think the blacks are

08:40.169 --> 08:42.293
treated about like everybody else. I mean, it was 
probably, as I said before, that it was probably

08:42.353 --> 08:56.562
another victory for them because of their 
involvement in Vietnam and losing their lives

08:42.353 --> 08:56.562
just like the Americans were in other wars and 
stuff like this. They were segregated into their

08:56.582 --> 09:00.169
own little groups were in Vietnam. or this type of 
combat more, they were associated with more of the

09:00.352 --> 09:03.615
Americans. So they approved themselves. In other 
words, some of them got medals of honors and was

09:05.277 --> 09:08.581
awarded medal of honors. They may not be here to 
have the medal, their parents have it, but they

09:09.081 --> 09:16.449
sacrificed their lives to save other American 
lives, the blacks. So the blacks and whites

09:16.669 --> 09:20.092
associated freely in Vietnam? Right. There was a 
few problems maybe, but like I said, they stuck to

09:20.753 --> 09:24.537
their selves. even though they knew that they had 
to still be together. Like I think in any type of

09:27.583 --> 09:40.868
combat situation, you can have your different 
ethnic groups, but in a situation when you go to the

09:27.583 --> 09:40.868
field as a military involvement action, 
everybody works together because everybody has

09:27.583 --> 09:40.868
to look out for surviving. So they work together. 
While the American soldiers were fighting in the

09:44.260 --> 09:55.112
jungles of Southeast Asia, do you think it was 
right for many other Americans to protest against

09:44.260 --> 09:55.112
the war? Well, I guess that would have to go back to 
the freedom of speech. I mean, I didn't think too

10:02.179 --> 10:11.449
much of people being back here while I was over 
there to me as being a military Fighting for our

10:12.003 --> 10:23.274
country and these people back here protesting the 
war, like I said, their opinions and my opinions

10:12.003 --> 10:23.274
are different, so everybody has their views of the 
war. So if that's what they wanted to do, I guess,

10:23.354 --> 10:26.282
you know. Our government is often referred to as 
the, and I quote, government of the people, by the

10:28.844 --> 10:36.973
people, and for the people. In 1971, a Harris poll 
showed that 71% of those questioned thought we had

10:37.734 --> 10:49.086
made a mistake by sending troops to Vietnam in the 
first place. 58% regarded the war as immoral, and a

10:49.107 --> 10:56.775
majority favored pulling all our troops out of 
Vietnam by the end of 1971, even if that meant a

10:56.755 --> 11:02.580
communist takeover of the country.

11:07.424 --> 11:12.248
The Nixon administration continued the bombing 
and killing even after this. Do you believe it was

11:13.009 --> 11:21.136
right for a democratic government to go against 
the will of the majority when the dissent was so

11:13.009 --> 11:21.136
obvious? The political people back here

11:27.923 --> 11:29.365
thought we shouldn't be in Vietnam. And after a 
while, I guess, the government, Nixon, as you

11:29.725 --> 11:43.102
said, started pulling the troops out, or had 
started planning on pulling out the troops in Nam.

11:43.863 --> 11:53.475
And so he had so much political pressure put 
against him because we were not going anywhere in

11:43.863 --> 11:53.475
Vietnam.

11:55.582 --> 12:08.754
So as you stated within your paper, even though we 
were going to pull out, that we were not going to

11:55.582 --> 12:08.754
support the people no longer, and it would turn 
into a communist country, which is what really

11:55.582 --> 12:08.754
happened after we moved out. Because after we 
moved out in 73, the North Vietnamese, the Viet

12:09.155 --> 12:25.470
Cong, actually just because of us leaving, the 
people no longer, the fighting people tried for

12:09.155 --> 12:25.470
what I think about another, Not too long after we 
pulled out, they didn't fight too long, and the

12:26.260 --> 12:33.688
country was given up, and the whole country was 
taken over. President Eisenhower in 1965

12:35.830 --> 12:52.167
had believed that if Vietnam went to the 
communists, then the rest of the Asia would fall,

12:35.830 --> 12:52.167
and I quote, like a row of dominoes. almost 15 years 
after the Vietnam went to the Communists, we did

12:52.788 --> 13:03.479
not see many Asian countries falling to the 
Communists. Do you believe that President

13:04.260 --> 13:14.250
Eisenhower was wrong by exaggerating the extent 
and the importance of Vietnam?

13:16.832 --> 13:20.416
I think what Eisenhower said could have possibly 
happened. It all depends on how after North

13:23.011 --> 13:33.342
Vietnam and Red China, wanted to push things after 
they took over North Vietnam and supported the

13:23.011 --> 13:33.342
North Vietnamese. If they felt more strongly of 
taking other countries like they are right now, I

13:33.823 --> 13:47.938
think we still have problems in Cambodia and 
different places like this that they're trying

13:33.823 --> 13:47.938
to... take over. So part of this is still might be 
coming true. It's not a big thing going, even

13:51.250 --> 14:01.085
though just North Vietnam was the only one that was 
taken over and it became communism.

14:04.170 --> 14:15.107
Do you feel that Americans understood the culture 
of South Vietnam and the Americans had the ability

14:04.170 --> 14:15.107
to speak for the South Vietnamese people? Were we 
really trying to do what... I think we were trying

14:19.643 --> 14:30.337
to do what we were required to do with the country, 
but it became such a political thing after a while,

14:19.643 --> 14:30.337
after so many years of us being in NAM. And we were, 
as I always looked at too, for the United States

14:30.498 --> 14:42.513
being as big as we were, that we could not go and do 
certain things. There was a lot of things... we

14:47.217 --> 14:57.632
couldn't do in Vietnam because of orders like we 
couldn't put ammunition or something like this in

14:47.217 --> 14:57.632
the weapons and you're in a combat zone in certain 
areas. These were pretty cool things. These

15:00.497 --> 15:14.237
people all looked alike over there so if you're 
going to protect yourself, why should I have a

15:00.497 --> 15:14.237
weapon on me but I cannot put ammunition in it and be 
ready for any type of thing that might happen

15:00.497 --> 15:14.237
because All their people looked alike to me over 
there. Even the person that could, a lot of times we

15:18.393 --> 15:28.502
had the same problem, that we had the people from 
Vietnam were double agents. They were working

15:28.802 --> 15:32.225
both sides of the fence, as you can call. Some of 
them would, since they, you know, they would work

15:33.026 --> 15:40.833
for us and they also worked for the Viet Cong, they 
were double agents. And they were also troops that

15:41.433 --> 15:44.376
were double agents. would work and we had sent out a 
lot of people a lot of times and our people got shot

15:44.727 --> 16:14.667
in the back because of the other people so you could 
never tell it uh

15:44.727 --> 16:14.667
so did you all have a hard time distinguishing the 
enemy right you would have a hard time

15:44.727 --> 16:14.667
distinguishing the enemy because they all just 
like when you even if he was talking about the

15:44.727 --> 16:14.667
japanese now they would be a little different 
because we did not support the Japanese like we did

16:15.912 --> 16:21.380
the Vietnamese, that we were fighting them so we 
knew who we were fighting. It would be kind of

16:22.341 --> 16:26.827
difficult also during World War II when you were 
fighting Germans. German people look like us. If

16:30.713 --> 16:39.405
they put clothes on or put uniforms on like us and 
could talk our language,

16:30.713 --> 16:39.405
we could accept them as the Americans and they 
could go right in and be enemy people. Where in Viet

16:45.818 --> 16:51.648
Cong or Vietnamese, we were over there working 
with them alongside them. We did not know if we were

16:51.868 --> 16:58.178
working alongside a Viet Cong or a good person. So 
it was a hard situation. I think especially in some

17:00.182 --> 17:04.228
of the jobs that we had, You couldn't trust the 
people. I had good friends over there. I made good

17:08.442 --> 17:10.404
friends with a lot of people over there. But still, 
I think there were still cases where people

17:11.946 --> 17:22.320
couldn't trust them because of knowing other 
people had turned or found out they were double

17:11.946 --> 17:22.320
agents.

17:29.629 --> 17:34.215
Mr. Coon, what do you believe was the cause of 
America's loss in Vietnam? I think we really

17:35.292 --> 17:38.115
didn't lose in Vietnam. Yeah, we lost a lot of lives 
and things, but we were there for the government,

17:38.175 --> 17:47.623
our government, working along with the 
Vietnamese government. And after it became such a

17:49.164 --> 18:03.477
political type thing that we were not going 
anywhere, and it was a big expense for us being

17:49.164 --> 18:03.477
there, that the government just decided to pull 
our troops and American forces back out of

17:49.164 --> 18:03.477
Vietnam.

18:06.325 --> 18:12.735
Yes, we pulled out, and a lot of our troops looked at 
it as a war we never won. So in other words, that

18:12.756 --> 18:21.009
could be what they're saying, what you just said, 
was that a loss, which it would be a loss. It was

18:21.410 --> 18:22.672
something we never completed. Why do you think 
that happened? Why do you think the government

18:25.356 --> 18:27.760
pulled out the troops? The American peoples back 
here just thought that we shouldn't be there after

18:28.904 --> 18:34.692
a period of time. It was just a big, big thing. And 
most of it was political. I was just serving in the

18:40.840 --> 18:46.587
military, so really I did not get involved with 
looking why the government sent me there. I did not

18:46.607 --> 18:53.476
ask questions of why the government sent me there, 
because I was in the US military in an army. That was

18:54.337 --> 18:57.021
my job if they sent me there. The times they sent me 
there are different times. They sent me there, it

19:00.626 --> 19:03.029
was my job, so I went. But when they asked me to come 
back, I came back. I mean, I felt bad that we'd come

19:05.613 --> 19:08.457
back. Well, really, I wasn't there at the time they 
started pulling them out. But I looked at it as

19:13.624 --> 19:22.217
being at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and was 
hearing on the radio news that Nixon had started

19:13.624 --> 19:22.217
pulling troops out of Nam. I think most of it was 
just a big political thing. And re-election and

19:26.245 --> 19:34.517
things like this were coming up, just like when 
Eisenhower was getting re-elected or was

19:26.245 --> 19:34.517
elected, he was pulling troops out of Korea and 
things like this. And so that helped him get,

19:35.559 --> 19:45.553
because people favored

19:35.559 --> 19:45.553
that, so they went ahead and elected him. But Nixon 
had promised in 1968 that he's going to pull out the

19:46.782 --> 19:52.550
troops very soon. But after that, he continued the 
bombing of North Vietnam, and America is said to

19:53.031 --> 20:05.810
have dropped more bombs on North Vietnam than 
bombs dropped in the entire World War II on

19:53.031 --> 20:05.810
Germany. So do you think that Nixon kept his 
promise of withdrawing from Vietnam as soon as he

20:06.311 --> 20:14.663
had said he would? Like he said, he was talking 
about pulling them out, but I think he still looked

20:15.335 --> 20:25.490
at it that we had an obligation to the country, the 
Vietnamese, the country he was supporting. And

20:26.231 --> 20:29.996
then he did start really pulling them out until 
about five years later, I think. He pulled them out

20:30.457 --> 20:35.925
in 1973, was actually when we started pulling the 
troops out of Vietnam.

20:38.707 --> 20:46.514
that I think, like you say, it was a political war, 
and so he was just waiting the right time to pull

20:38.707 --> 20:46.514
them out. I mean, as they always said, like you 
said, that they dropped more bombs there, but a lot

20:46.674 --> 21:08.612
of those bombs, when they dropped, did not hit 
solid ground, and the reason they don't explode

20:46.674 --> 21:08.612
was because they go into the ground, and they're 
sitting over there, and a lot of the bombs may not

20:46.674 --> 21:08.612
even have exploded because of the rice paddies 
they drop into, and those rice paddies are real wet

21:09.605 --> 21:12.478
and they had to get away of letting these bombs 
drop. So it was just a money-making thing, I think,

21:13.442 --> 21:17.379
too. There was other people involved. Many 
critics of the Vietnam War say that we had become so

21:20.557 --> 21:39.534
obsessed with fighting communism that we 
violated the very principles of our own

21:20.557 --> 21:39.534
democratic government, the principles that the 
American forefathers had thought the country was

21:20.557 --> 21:39.534
going to stand on. For example, Nixon and Johnson 
had lied to the American people a lot of times. and

21:47.742 --> 21:59.672
the CIA was misused for the surveillance of the 
domestic problems and that was not the intention

21:47.742 --> 21:59.672
of the CIA when they made that agency. So do you 
think all these actions of the American

22:00.093 --> 22:04.196
government can be justified?

22:07.699 --> 22:17.648
I guess by being in the business that Nixon and 
Johnson are both in and they're the highest

22:07.699 --> 22:17.648
office, they used their facilities like the CIA to 
accomplish missions that probably in no other

22:18.421 --> 22:25.328
unit you could probably accomplish. We had even 
your other forces would have your espionage out

22:25.368 --> 22:33.737
there doing the same thing we did. So if we got other 
countries out there doing the same thing, even

22:33.797 --> 22:47.972
though by political law or war, it was just mostly 
that through

22:50.602 --> 22:57.971
the government that they actually said they 
violated the misuse of those units just because of

22:50.602 --> 22:57.971
that. If it had been an actual combat situation 
where it would have been really like it was in World

22:58.031 --> 23:11.747
War II in Korea or something, they would probably, 
nobody would have probably said anything about

22:58.031 --> 23:11.747
using that unit as what they were doing, I think. 
But because it was not, Vietnam was never

23:12.408 --> 23:17.554
considered as a war, it was more of a policing 
action, more like Korea except we did a little

23:18.682 --> 23:48.452
different in Korea that I think that what they did 
would probably not have been even nothing would

23:18.682 --> 23:48.452
have been said about but since it was not an actual 
type situation it just became political and these

23:18.682 --> 23:48.452
were type of things that they did just so that they 
probably people bring out like they're doing

23:18.682 --> 23:48.452
anything when you're up for elections you get out 
the dirty you get out your dirty weapons and those

23:18.682 --> 23:48.452
were things that they they bring up saying that to 
bring against these people If the Vietnamese

23:50.170 --> 24:03.605
culture were to be similar to the American 
culture, and if the Vietnamese people looked like

23:50.170 --> 24:03.605
the American people, do you think it would have 
been much more easier for America to accomplish

23:50.170 --> 24:03.605
goals in Vietnam? In other words, do you think 
there was a cultural conflict in Vietnam? I don't

24:09.752 --> 24:12.395
think there was a cultural conflict. I just think 
that the government there asked our government to

24:12.475 --> 24:19.823
assist them

24:23.313 --> 24:33.543
in a situation of not being, coming under 
communism, and the Viet Cong were being supported

24:23.313 --> 24:33.543
by Red China and different things like this, even 
by Russia. Weapons and stuff were being sent to

24:35.345 --> 24:40.490
Vietnam through the Hanoi and different things 
like this. The only culture thing was, as you work

24:41.451 --> 24:53.202
with these people, especially if you, working 
like I was in Special Forces, and you went out with

24:41.451 --> 24:53.202
the units like the Mike Force or a Ranger outfit, 
that if you went out there with these people, you

24:54.633 --> 25:06.849
did not know whether you were taking good people or 
were you taking a nipple trader. And otherwise, I

25:07.971 --> 25:17.383
think the culture or the people got along with the 
Americans, in fact, They thought real highly of

25:17.920 --> 25:21.464
the Americans until we started pulling out. And 
then they felt real bad that we pulled out and left

25:21.945 --> 25:24.648
them. Did you talk to any of your... Did you have any 
Vietnamese friends? Yes. Did you talk to any of

25:32.817 --> 25:37.823
them while America was pulling out of Vietnam? I 
was not there when they were pulling out because I

25:38.184 --> 25:45.212
left in 71 and they did not pull out until 73. But 
I've... ate with them and things like this when I

25:48.565 --> 25:52.670
was in Spaceship Forces and different things like 
this. And they're just like me or you.

25:59.039 --> 26:11.615
Even if the guy was a double agent, if he had no 
intentions of killing you and was just there for

25:59.039 --> 26:11.615
mostly intelligent purposes, he could be just as 
good a friend as anybody as long as you didn't know.

26:11.635 --> 26:15.400
So you could work alongside with anybody. What do 
you think about the South Vietnamese government?

26:19.890 --> 26:31.296
A lot of people have criticized the United States 
for supporting a very despotic government that

26:19.890 --> 26:31.296
was really, you know, ruled the Vietnamese people 
with the iron hand. they had corruption in their

26:31.647 --> 26:42.077
government, but the United States was supporting 
them, people say, because they just wanted to

26:31.647 --> 26:42.077
fight the greater evil of communism. Do you 
believe that the South Vietnamese government was

26:42.538 --> 26:47.602
really corrupt? On that, I can go along with that. I 
think the Vietnamese government was corrupt.

26:59.554 --> 27:01.536
They, because... They would take anything the 
Americans were giving away.

27:07.051 --> 27:11.918
Gave them, like I said, we supported them in monies 
and different things like this. We supported them

27:11.938 --> 27:15.603
in equipment and things like this, ammunition, 
guns. And we supported them. And you had a lot of

27:17.285 --> 27:27.159
people in their political government that abused 
what, especially your higher ranking officers in

27:17.285 --> 27:27.159
the government or anything like that, in the 
military. Yes, and they abused their people. I've

27:31.570 --> 27:52.279
seen this, but like you say, we were only there for 
the purpose of them asking us to support them in a

27:31.570 --> 27:52.279
cause that we felt that would benefit the United 
States in the longer run that Vietnam not become

27:31.570 --> 27:52.279
communism. But after a period of time, people and 
the judgment of the people decided that we were it

27:55.752 --> 28:21.895
was a losing call since we've been here close to 10 
years or more and nothing was going on like you said

27:55.752 --> 28:21.895
we've been dropping bombs and had dropped more 
bombs and uh on uh in Vietnam than we dropped in

27:55.752 --> 28:21.895
World War II and it was a losing call so why keep 
doing this and not be going gaining any footage And

28:22.634 --> 28:50.262
then when the United States moved out, a lot of 
their people and their higher-up government in

28:22.634 --> 28:50.262
different places like this are now living in the 
United States because they can no longer stay

28:22.634 --> 28:50.262
within Vietnam because once the country was taken 
over, either the people would do them in or the Viet

28:22.634 --> 28:50.262
Cong or the Vietnamese or Red China or whoever came 
in would actually physically put them in prison

28:22.634 --> 28:50.262
and re-interrogate them to become a communism. 
which is what they do now. They're trying to

28:51.566 --> 28:57.414
rehabilitate their captured soldiers over 
there. They're in school and they sit around and

28:57.454 --> 29:10.410
have to go attend a class, mostly of it is in 
communism, stating what the Vietnamese

28:57.454 --> 29:10.410
government wants them to do. Did you encounter 
anybody who was associated with the Viet Cong? Did

29:19.807 --> 29:22.290
you talk to anybody who was... There was one time 
when we were working and when I was in Special

29:22.310 --> 29:40.850
Forces and I was there in a camp and we were 
building, like I said, we were building Special

29:22.310 --> 29:40.850
Forces camps and we hire civilians or people to 
come in and work alongside us and help us build.

29:41.231 --> 29:46.176
This also was supporting their economy to help the 
people out in those areas. We were paying... the

29:47.498 --> 29:55.166
out people, they were not military, but they were 
civilian people, Vietnamese people, to come in

29:47.498 --> 29:55.166
and work alongside us to build these special 
forces camps. And there was one time when we were

29:55.987 --> 30:07.240
there that word was out that one of the guys that was 
there was a double agent. He was there, he was

30:07.280 --> 30:15.008
wearing white pajamas, but when he was there 
during the day, The reason why we noticed that he

30:15.494 --> 30:39.807
was more on the other side was we started noticing, 
because we have people watching our people when

30:15.494 --> 30:39.807
we're out there, and I guess he must not know 
somebody's watching him, and he was pacing off

30:15.494 --> 30:39.807
from bunker to bunker, and the time he left there, 
because we let him go until the end of the day. At the

30:39.827 --> 30:45.214
end of the day, we kept him and found out that he 
was... under interrogation and asking him that he

30:45.886 --> 31:00.783
was a hardcore Viet Cong agent that was sent in to 
infiltrate and find out our

30:45.886 --> 31:00.783
dimensions of the thing. So if he'd left there that 
night, most likely that night, we'd have probably

31:00.803 --> 31:06.850
been mortared severely. And he would have had real 
bad casualties because he would have been able to

31:08.071 --> 31:15.319
tell him exactly where to shift their guns and 
stuff or their mortars when they come in exactly

31:15.637 --> 31:22.065
right on our bunkers and things like this. So what 
did you all do with that guy? Well, he just became a

31:26.210 --> 31:27.932
prisoner after that. Then we interrogated him, 
and then after that, by a policy of the American

31:27.952 --> 31:36.342
government, we called in a chopper because we were 
sitting out in the middle of nowhere. We called in a

31:36.522 --> 31:44.732
chopper and sent him back for higher-up 
interrogation, and that's where, actually,

31:36.522 --> 31:44.732
physically, they more did the interrogation.
