00:06.055 --> 00:32.940
First, Dr. Jones, tell us something about your 
early life, including the names and dates and

00:06.055 --> 00:32.940
places of birth of your parents, something about 
your parents, if you can remember, and then the

00:06.055 --> 00:32.940
name, I mean, the place and date of your birth and 
the schools you attended before you went off to

00:06.055 --> 00:32.940
college. Starting in with my parents, father was 
born almost in Galveston, but it happened early in

00:33.612 --> 00:45.423
New York City. And then mother had to get down to 
Galveston in the process of the Civil War and had to

00:46.785 --> 01:00.818
run the barricade to get into Galveston where my 
grandfather, who went to Galveston in 1838 as a

00:46.785 --> 01:00.818
watchmaker, held forth as a defense captain. And 
she was on a sailing vessel and tried to, and got

01:06.675 --> 01:14.945
into port and they bothered, they couldn't find 
him. Finally they looked around and found that in

01:15.806 --> 01:20.552
those days where they wore a hoop skirt, he was 
under the hoop skirt. And the life during the Civil

01:21.813 --> 01:28.341
War was rather uneventful.

01:29.350 --> 01:45.669
But after that,

01:29.350 --> 01:45.669
his family, father's family, moved up into 
Saratoga, New York, where he had some property.

01:46.850 --> 01:56.061
And when father got old enough, he went to college 
at what was then a small Presbyterian college,

01:46.850 --> 01:56.061
Princeton, New Jersey. And as soon as he got out, he 
came into Texas because he couldn't get Galveston

01:59.742 --> 02:01.885
out of his mind. But the competition was so heavy 
that he went up to San Marcos in 1883 and opened up a,

02:02.806 --> 02:26.639
what was very rare in those days, an ice making 
machinery, ice factory, where they had to distill

02:02.806 --> 02:26.639
the water in order to get it to freeze quick enough 
because their condensing process wasn't what it

02:02.806 --> 02:26.639
became later. He went from there into at the friend 
of Frank Ball of Galveston into Temple, 1887,

02:30.016 --> 02:55.803
opened up the Temple National Bank, where he was 
president and part owner, and kept in there, and

02:30.016 --> 02:55.803
then he helped open up the First National Bank of 
McGregor. Shortly after that, he married in 1889,

03:00.037 --> 03:14.370
the daughter of the president of Baylor Female 
College, which had just moved from, had

03:00.037 --> 03:14.370
previously moved from old Independence in 
Washington County up to Belton, Texas. And 1889,

03:15.691 --> 03:29.723
1894, I was born in a town of about 3,200, which The 
later friends that we had in other states said I was

03:30.057 --> 03:38.530
born in the black land prairie dirt between my 
toes. They called it mud. I

03:40.033 --> 03:56.318
helped, was able to be in a neighborhood where the 
boys were pretty well schooled with

03:40.033 --> 03:56.318
catch-as-catch-can type of living. learned to 
pick cotton, learned to chop cotton, learned to

03:57.513 --> 04:04.120
herd cows. Father took up a little ranch in New 
Mexico, but continued to live in Temple. By virtue

04:11.008 --> 04:24.043
of getting a scholarship, I was able to go to 
Princeton in 1913,

04:11.008 --> 04:24.043
graduated in 1917, and get into the 10th 
Engineers. What was your major at Princeton?

04:29.609 --> 04:30.209
Geology. How did you happen to pick that field? Due 
to father. He was a forest, they called him a forest

04:33.734 --> 04:39.141
enthusiast. His enemies called him a forest nut. 
And the media's called him a conservation

04:42.186 --> 04:48.494
something. Because whenever they'd have a big 
rain in Bell County, the muddy water run down,

04:49.315 --> 04:54.402
somebody would hilariously caught him up and 
said, Jones, Bell County's washing into the Gulf.

05:01.025 --> 05:22.431
The Temple is on a branch of the Leon, which goes 
into Little River, which goes into the Brazos,

05:01.025 --> 05:22.431
which is known to have had the biggest rise of any 
tributary of the Brazos in recorded history,

05:01.025 --> 05:22.431
because in 19, I believe, It was either 1921 or 
1919.

05:30.248 --> 05:48.553
Little River rose to such an extent that the 
Brazzers River ran uphill from a

05:30.248 --> 05:48.553
place west of Huron on the Brazzers where it runs 
over the rocks.

05:50.373 --> 06:17.595
uphill and many of the local settlers in that area 
thought earth had come to an end for the river run

05:50.373 --> 06:17.595
uphill well he was familiar with all that history 
and passed it on to us

05:50.373 --> 06:17.595
and after the first world war i was been 
transferred into this into the service of the rear

05:50.373 --> 06:17.595
where i'd come in close contact with what europe 
did with their conservation work with Forrest,

06:18.419 --> 06:25.887
was able to get a job under Mr. Seakey at A&M. You did 
serve in Europe then during the First World War.

06:28.550 --> 06:29.671
Eighteen months. In what area? Mostly from the 
standpoint of survival in the service of the rear,

06:31.593 --> 06:45.287
in production of railroad ties and aircraft. 
stakes for the front and narrow gauge equipment

06:47.123 --> 07:14.262
and temporary huts for use at the front and was able 
and was fortunate enough to get on a logging crew

06:47.123 --> 07:14.262
with Minnesota Lumberjacks where in spite of my 
size I held my own in a four-man crew in the daily

07:14.933 --> 07:16.295
production. So I would guess from what you said, at 
that point Western Europe was somewhat ahead of us

07:16.315 --> 07:23.124
in conservation. Oh my gosh, pardon me, eliminate 
that. His father, who had married a German girl in

07:30.433 --> 07:40.907
1890, he had taken my, my grandfather had taken my 
father into the forest of Germany just as a matter

07:41.343 --> 07:46.389
of interest to study the Schwarzwald Black 
Forest. And he became a forest enthusiast and was

07:46.409 --> 08:03.288
appointed the first individual in Texas to study 
the extent of the forest area of East Texas, some

07:46.409 --> 08:03.288
21,000 acres, I think. I'm

08:03.308 --> 08:10.776
mixed up now on my area. of East Texas, and as a 
result of that, he was able to get, with the aid of

08:11.431 --> 08:35.498
Dr. Bissell, who helped him compose the ticket, he 
was able to get Jim Ferguson to create a State

08:11.431 --> 08:35.498
Department of Forestry in 1914.

08:36.136 --> 08:40.844
Was your father appointed to study the forest area 
of East Texas by the state of Texas? No, by the

08:40.964 --> 08:44.890
National Forest Service. U.S. Forest Service. 
Without stipend. And he was that enthusiastic, he

08:49.838 --> 08:57.030
used his own funds to canvas the legislature. And 
against odds, such as one of the legislators said,

08:57.938 --> 09:09.015
Jones, he said, what are you going to make out of 
this if it's passed, this bill on forestry? But he

09:09.035 --> 09:11.418
didn't make anything out of it. In fact, he gave to 
it. But with that interest, he thought that maybe

09:13.642 --> 09:19.691
it would be a good thing if I went into that. And Mr. 
Seakey gave me a job with Forestry. in charge of the

09:23.555 --> 09:28.343
so-called forest fire prevention work in 1919. I 
was able in first division to get out in April 1919

09:28.503 --> 09:44.309
and got quite interested in it but began to see the 
advantage of a background in agriculture. Got a an

09:47.956 --> 09:54.945
assistantship under Dr. J. O. Morgan, head of the 
Department of Agronomy. That's here at Texas A&M.

09:58.189 --> 10:15.330
At A&M in the fall of 1919 and another 
assistantship due to having written some

09:58.189 --> 10:15.330
editorials and letters from the people in the 
Houston Tribune on defense of the YMCA and

10:21.217 --> 10:49.806
right in the first world war so i served as 
assistant secretary of the y and also as assistant

10:21.217 --> 10:49.806
in agronomy from 1919 to 21. became general 
secretary of ymc 21 to 22 and then got our

10:21.217 --> 10:49.806
wanderlust and start teaching in houston and 
mathematics 23 and came back to teach under dr

10:21.217 --> 10:49.806
humbert chemistry freshman chemistry in the fall 
of 1923,

10:50.832 --> 10:59.261
which was quite a varied background. Yes, it was. I 
coached, I organized a wrestling team here in the

11:01.163 --> 11:20.282
fall of 1919, just out of having created a general 
interest from a man as small as I was to have made a

11:01.163 --> 11:20.282
public demonstration for the tea club with Oscar 
Frazier, who was a middleweight. interested the

11:21.038 --> 11:25.223
students enough to ask for a team. There had not 
been one before I think. No, there had been some

11:27.807 --> 11:49.695
interest in it, but we didn't even have mats and we 
were able through various means to get some mats

11:27.807 --> 11:49.695
and in the old chapel we had our workout place and 
for three years we had a recognized varsity team

11:27.807 --> 11:49.695
and tied Oklahoma A&M in the spring of 22, we got 
three first, they got three first, TU got one

11:50.857 --> 11:58.026
first. When you started your classes at A&M for 
your master's, did you then leave the employment

11:58.046 --> 12:06.195
of the Forest Service? Yes. So you said you were an 
assistant in agronomy plus assistant secretary

12:07.217 --> 12:16.127
of the Y, so you had two, in a sense, two jobs plus 
taking courses. If I'd been a better had devoted

12:19.645 --> 12:22.070
more time to wrestling. As a letter sport, it

12:23.574 --> 12:38.346
would have remained, but it didn't give it enough 
time after that first three years.

12:39.490 --> 12:41.873
You indicated that you taught chemistry for one 
year. Had you had some chemistry background when

12:42.253 --> 12:48.520
you were working on your bachelor's, I take it? 
Yes, both as bachelor's and as master's degree.

12:53.386 --> 12:55.228
OK. I believe I picked up in a newspaper somewhere 
that you organized a Boy Scout troop in 1923. Yeah,

13:00.313 --> 13:03.937
we had the first Boy Scout troop in College 
Station. And outside of three months, the first

13:04.018 --> 13:08.923
one in the county. Dr. Barron beat me too, having 
the first in the county. I gather then that at that

13:15.797 --> 13:24.486
point, certainly most of the boys must have been 
children of faculty members. Yes. Had you been a

13:24.767 --> 13:27.930
Boy Scout in your younger life? No, I had seen the 
first Boy Scouts organized in 19...

13:36.477 --> 13:38.259
I think 1921. It

13:38.299 --> 13:45.647
wasn't too old prior to that. It brought over from 
England, and we had two scout organizations at

13:45.667 --> 13:49.532
that time. One survived, the Scouts of America.

13:55.058 --> 14:03.708
And so, well, I gather that you left the campus 
pretty soon after that, though, didn't you, to go

13:55.058 --> 14:03.708
on to Cornell for your doctorate? Yes. I had a 
friend who was also named Jones, the boys called

14:04.422 --> 14:10.148
him Head End Jones, initialed with B.C. Jones, a 
late B.C. Jones, died two years ago, three years

14:11.469 --> 14:33.332
ago, who was a good friend in chemistry, and I had 
taught a year in Houston, Central High, and

14:11.469 --> 14:33.332
enjoyed teaching so much, and he said that you 
never get anywhere unless you go and do graduate

14:11.469 --> 14:33.332
work. for a doctorate degree. So I took that advice 
and

14:36.281 --> 14:49.517
entered Cornell University with a scholarship.

14:50.418 --> 14:53.122
Let's talk a little bit more about your master's 
work at A&M. At that point, of course, this was

14:55.425 --> 14:59.350
prior to the creation of the graduate school. Yes. 
How did, who then awarded your degree or? Dr. J.O.

15:09.072 --> 15:33.272
Morgan was head of agronomy and was also a graduate 
of Cornell and a very able and enthusiastic

15:09.072 --> 15:33.272
advisor and gave me a lot of boost in my research 
work of all things in buckwheat or which

15:33.742 --> 15:42.190
economically didn't fit this climate enough to 
become a major factor. That was the research for

15:42.350 --> 15:44.211
your dissertation? Yes, sir. Here? Here, yeah. 
Was your degree then, I take it, would have come

15:50.317 --> 15:56.262
from the College of Agriculture rather than since 
there was no graduate school? Yes, sir. Dean

15:57.503 --> 16:01.487
Pereira and I had several very pleasant Quentin 
Ships as did Dr. Fraps in the chemical work that I

16:02.294 --> 16:06.819
did. Did you have to do a proposal for your thesis? 
And Dr. Hedges, of course. Did you have to do a

16:12.946 --> 16:15.670
written proposal for your thesis work? Yes, sir. 
And had, but I didn't have to pass, for the master's

16:17.632 --> 16:22.978
I didn't have to pass any language. But having 
learned German from the time I was seven years old,

16:24.800 --> 16:30.647
it helped me quite a bit in in my language 
requirement at Cornell, and the French in the Army

16:31.403 --> 16:40.754
helped quite a bit in the two language requirement 
at that time.

16:44.118 --> 16:47.021
Your thesis proposal then, who would you submit 
that to? The head of the agronomy department? Yes,

16:49.084 --> 16:56.432
it was to go to Casper Allen Wood, who in turn had We 
had Mr. Casper Allen Wood and Dr. J.O. Morgan as the

17:01.597 --> 17:07.727
two advisors on it and for the minor, Dr. C.C. 
Hedges. I was aware that you had your master's from

17:10.551 --> 17:17.522
here and I checked and we do have a copy of your 
thesis back on file. It's still there with all the

17:17.883 --> 17:23.331
pictures in it.

17:24.813 --> 17:32.102
Let's see, was one of your faculty members here 
some influence in your decision to go to Cornell?

17:32.262 --> 17:52.086
Dr. Morgan, it wasn't too easy at that time to get a 
fellowship, but Dr. Morgan was very helpful in

17:32.262 --> 17:52.086
getting his personal friend, Dr. T. Littleton 
Lyons and Dr. Harry O. Buckman to get that, to get me

17:32.262 --> 17:52.086
into Cornell. And then what did you continue, you 
continued with agronomy at that point? Yes, we

17:56.135 --> 17:59.279
called it later soil science. So

17:59.399 --> 18:13.678
did you have some arrangement whereby you could 
come back to A&M once you completed your

17:59.399 --> 18:13.678
dissertation, your degree, or was it sort of by 
accident that you were able to come back? I was

18:14.779 --> 18:21.668
given, Dr. Morgan said he would like to have me on 
the staff, But that's as far as it went. And at

18:25.485 --> 18:36.722
that time and that summer, I started out at 
University of Colorado, where incidentally I met

18:25.485 --> 18:36.722
my wife the summer of 24. And I took physical 
chemistry there, differential integral

18:38.384 --> 18:45.154
equations and calculus there. And I found out I 
didn't decide. With all that chemistry seemed to

18:48.648 --> 19:00.666
offer then, I decided to take Dr. Morgan's and 
Joan's advice and take agronomy. And I went on the

19:01.306 --> 19:02.989
way east. I sold my car in Boulder. And on my way 
east, I stopped at University of Nebraska,

19:06.494 --> 19:17.490
University of Minnesota, Wisconsin U, 
University of Illinois. University of Ohio to

19:18.382 --> 19:26.573
Columbia and Yale to see what I might like there. I 
had an uncle, I mean a cousin-uncle, my father's

19:26.593 --> 19:46.701
cousin at Yale at Dean, but I had too many 
antipathies from undergraduate work there, but I

19:26.593 --> 19:46.701
wound up at a place, the only place where I had lost 
my honors

19:26.593 --> 19:46.701
for an an intercollegiate championship to a 
Cornell man. That's where I decided to stay. They

19:52.925 --> 19:58.512
wouldn't promise me a thing as to the length of time 
it would take to get a graduate degree at all. But

19:59.713 --> 20:04.459
they did take me on, I was happy to say. And so what, 
you were there, what, four years? Three. Three. At

20:09.325 --> 20:09.886
which time? Counting the summers, I was three 
years. Uh-huh. At which time you had the doctor's

20:12.709 --> 20:15.152
degree then? I had to do a little extra afterwards. 
I got the conferring of the degree in 27. Okay, then

20:20.961 --> 20:25.306
you came here then in 26? Yes. Back to the agronomy 
department? Yes. Were you appointed, what, as an

20:30.273 --> 20:35.961
instructor, or did you have a higher ranking than 
that? Dr. Morgan gave me a tentative

20:36.121 --> 20:44.953
professorship, which was later.

20:46.300 --> 20:52.655
under Dean Carl was verified as a professor. And 
the highest I got ever was an acting head. And I may

20:59.972 --> 21:02.959
honestly say that's as much as I ever deserved. He 
was acting head of the agronomy department. For

21:08.150 --> 21:24.998
two sessions, the first 1933 and the second time 
1944.

21:26.362 --> 21:31.510
The agronomy department retained that same name 
as agronomy the whole time you were in it, did it

21:26.362 --> 21:31.510
not? From 26 through 52. It was later that it became 
soil science, soil and crop science section

21:34.154 --> 21:39.963
within that.

21:44.650 --> 21:48.076
What courses did you teach in agronomy? One of my 
students, who later became a graduate student,

21:55.066 --> 22:12.445
worked with me and we started the first course in 
soil conservation, 1934,

21:55.066 --> 22:12.445
and Red Thompson, Lewis Thompson, who's now dean, 
associate dean at Iowa State University. And I

22:13.887 --> 22:23.217
taught the course in soil conservation, general 
soils, which While I was in A&M, as a teacher, it was

22:23.770 --> 22:37.691
required two

22:23.770 --> 22:37.691
graduate courses, soil technology and soil 
management.

22:40.736 --> 22:49.569
And I filled in during the Depression in helping 
Professor Muldford in 105 agronomy. So that's

22:50.731 --> 22:52.393
crops.

22:58.297 --> 23:04.144
Did you have a number of graduate students working 
under you at different times? Yes, we had one of the

23:04.344 --> 23:18.582
captain of the track team, Hammonds, Schultz

23:04.344 --> 23:18.582
from Houston County.

23:21.325 --> 23:25.350
Strange to say Houston isn't in Houston County.

23:27.541 --> 23:44.959
Van Tine, who, with my help, we started one on the 
transpiration ratio of cotton, and I regret

23:27.541 --> 23:44.959
exceedingly we didn't publish the results due to 
some unfortunate occurrences. We did three years

23:45.980 --> 23:55.270
of work on that where we used 55-gallon drums, 12 of 
them, for replications. And I found that the water

23:56.650 --> 24:06.804
requirement of a cotton plant was about 105, but we 
never did publish it. The water requirement? Of a

24:08.126 --> 24:24.649
cotton plant, meaning it would take 105 pounds of 
water for every pound of cotton plant, which at

24:08.126 --> 24:24.649
that time was,

24:08.126 --> 24:24.649
we didn't find too much work on that particular 
specific problem.

24:27.143 --> 24:40.196
He was a very remarkable graduate student, but he 
unfortunately didn't get to finish his work, and I

24:27.143 --> 24:40.196
didn't either. Was this discovery that you made as 
the amount of water necessary, I guess what, to

24:40.396 --> 24:48.724
produce a pound of cotton? Yes, the whole plant, 
including the very minor lint and seed. this would

24:56.152 --> 25:01.819
be, what, helpful to people in determining how 
much water to use for irrigation? It is used, but in

25:02.520 --> 25:14.636
the Rio Grande Valley, through trial and error, 
they found approximately that amount. It varies,

25:16.799 --> 25:22.446
of course, according to the relative humidity. 
What about the type? Does the type of soil have any

25:24.049 --> 25:26.291
bearing on it? The physical condition of the soil 
would be important. By that, you mean the amount of

25:32.277 --> 25:35.160
humus in the soil or? Well, whether it's a sandy 
loam over a clay or a sandy loam over a sandy clay.

25:41.487 --> 25:51.117
This soil here has been referred to as the Lord put 
here to tie the Blackland Prairies to the East

25:41.487 --> 25:51.117
Texas sandy land. because of our in-Fergus gray 
clay subsoil.

26:02.065 --> 26:16.658
While you were on the teaching faculty, did you 
also do some individual research on your own that

26:02.065 --> 26:16.658
is other than assisting graduate students with 
their research?

26:18.940 --> 26:21.002
In my first years, I was president of the Science 
Seminar and then later the Social Science Seminar

26:21.792 --> 26:51.529
and did slide them out of a little bit of writing but 
in productive research that would where we use the

26:21.792 --> 26:51.529
the biometrical methods to determine the quality 
of it I did I tried to I was an assistant with Dr.

26:52.167 --> 27:02.601
Ralph Stewart and Dr. Reeves in working on certain 
ecological plant relationships. One of them, the

27:02.621 --> 27:11.172
bull nettle, where my main interest was is where 
you found the bull nettle, you would find the deep

27:02.621 --> 27:11.172
sandy soil. And otherwise, the value that bull 
nettle might produce in making a tapioca. due to

27:21.563 --> 27:24.947
that enormous sub-circuit's growth. But outside 
of one article in Journal of the American Society

27:25.968 --> 27:31.634
of Agronomy, I didn't do any. But

27:32.695 --> 27:39.163
you did do a lot of supervising of research. Quite a 
bit, and was admitted to the American Association

27:39.183 --> 27:51.216
for the Advancement of Science in

27:39.183 --> 27:51.216
Texas. I was made a fellow in the American 
Association for the Advancement of Science and a

27:52.462 --> 28:12.053
fellow in the Texas Scientific

27:52.462 --> 28:12.053
Association.

28:12.073 --> 28:17.161
I didn't finish what I started.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.005
What was your average teaching load? Eighteen 
hours. Eighteen hours, which meant that there was

28:22.339 --> 28:29.007
not a whole lot of time for research. To be a good 
teacher, using

28:29.047 --> 28:50.852
Watergate terminology, from my view, a man ought 
not to have in the soil size more than 25 to 30

28:29.047 --> 28:50.852
students at one time in one class, both from the 
pleasure of teaching standpoint and the

28:51.473 --> 28:58.880
communication with the students standpoint. And 
where you lecture the classes of 65 to 140, you lose

28:58.900 --> 29:10.551
that, I don't know, as part of that personal 
relationship. I would certainly think you would,

29:10.571 --> 29:12.253
yes. Some of the plentiest classes I had was when we 
were crowded and I had classes of 25 to 30 and top

29:20.802 --> 29:32.893
deck

29:20.802 --> 29:32.893
of Goodwin Hall where I could remember every boy's 
name and his face and his background. And the size

29:33.314 --> 29:36.697
of the class, I take it, was limited by the size of 
the room. Yes.

29:41.521 --> 29:49.729
I believe I remember having seen a clipping about 
you that indicated that as of a certain date, and I

29:41.521 --> 29:49.729
guess it was about your retirement time, that you 
had had at one time or another had about 95% of the

29:50.840 --> 29:57.556
agronomy graduates, I believe, in one of your 
courses. Yes, that was in the advanced

29:58.238 --> 30:08.562
soil management.
