00:11.303 --> 00:19.857
This is an interview with Dr. Larry Hickman by 
Kelly Wood on December 6, 1990, concerning the 60s

00:11.303 --> 00:19.857
movement. In the interest of accumulating 
knowledge, I am asking you, Dr. Hickman, to donate

00:21.019 --> 00:29.433
this tape to the Texas A&M Oral History Collection 
in the University Archives. Is this okay with you?

00:31.637 --> 00:31.737
Sure. Okay, great. Now I guess we'll begin. Where 
and when were you born? I was born in October 6,

00:37.325 --> 00:41.789
1942, in McAllen, Texas.

00:44.853 --> 00:48.456
Why did you choose to attend Hardin-Simmons 
University? I was interested in religious

00:49.677 --> 01:02.690
matters and religious studies and decided to go 
there because it had a program in religious

00:49.677 --> 01:02.690
studies that would be satisfactory to me. I grew up 
in the Southern Baptist Church. And although I

01:05.607 --> 01:17.441
wasn't interested in majoring in religion, I was 
interested in having access to some of the

01:05.607 --> 01:17.441
thinking in that area. As an undergraduate at 
Hardin-Simmons between 1960 and 1964, what were

01:17.461 --> 01:23.828
the dorm rules and regulations like? Dorm rules 
and regulations were different for male and

01:24.809 --> 01:32.678
female students, as I suppose they still are. The 
dorm rules and regulations for men, basically,

01:33.637 --> 01:44.336
male students didn't have any particular hours 
they had to keep.

01:47.601 --> 01:54.012
And in fact, apart from prohibitions against 
excessive noise, I suppose there weren't any

01:47.601 --> 01:54.012
regulations. The female students had to be in by 11 
o'clock on weeknights and 12 o'clock on weekends.

02:06.967 --> 02:11.497
And apart from that, I don't know what their other 
prohibitions were. Okay. Was there a dress code?

02:17.680 --> 02:24.471
There was no official dress code as far as dressing 
up. At Hardin-Simmons in the 1960s, the female

02:24.491 --> 02:30.681
students were not allowed to wear slacks, Levi's, 
anything like that. They had to wear dresses. You

02:33.566 --> 02:42.000
wouldn't, in fact, although I don't think it was 
official, you wouldn't wear Bermuda shorts to

02:33.566 --> 02:42.000
class. But as far as wearing a tie or something like 
that, that wasn't required. It was a little more

02:46.629 --> 02:50.923
formal than now, but not terribly so. Was drinking 
allowed? There was no drinking allowed, not only

02:54.502 --> 03:03.873
on the campus at Hardin-Simmons, being a Baptist 
college, a Baptist university, but also Abilene

02:54.502 --> 03:03.873
was dry. And in fact, it was only as I became a 
senior, I think, in 1964, did a local precinct go

03:04.534 --> 03:15.566
wet. So during most of the time I was there, alcohol 
was not available, oh, within a 50-mile radius of

03:15.726 --> 03:24.036
Abilene. Okay, thank you. Were your grades sent 
home to your parents? My grades were sent home to my

03:29.770 --> 03:33.476
parents, I believe. It's hard to reach back that 
far to get that memory, but yeah, I think they were.

03:39.506 --> 03:46.277
Okay, and when you attended University of Texas, 
did you still experience this in loco

03:39.506 --> 03:46.277
parenthesis? No, the grades weren't sent, if 
that's what you're asking. Grades were not sent to

03:52.149 --> 03:57.076
my parents when I was a graduate student at the 
University of Texas. There were, of course, no

03:57.657 --> 03:59.340
dress codes. I mean, you didn't, you could wear 
shorts to class if you felt like it. And I didn't

04:04.848 --> 04:11.438
live in a dorm, so I don't know what the 
restrictions were then.

04:13.156 --> 04:32.581
Certainly there was a much looser kind of 
atmosphere at the University of Texas, but it may

04:13.156 --> 04:32.581
just be accounted for by the fact that 
Hardin-Simmons was a small Baptist university of

04:13.156 --> 04:32.581
1,800 students, and the University of Texas was a 
large state university of 18,000 students. So it

04:32.601 --> 04:37.527
was an increase on the order of 10 in terms of the 
size of the university.

04:44.830 --> 04:48.796
Was the draft an issue discussed in 1960 through 
64? Not very much, although I've got to admit that I

04:50.258 --> 05:08.445
thought about the military service a good bit, 
because when I reached Hardin-Simmons, I was

04:50.258 --> 05:08.445
shocked to learn that ROTC was required for all 
freshman and sophomore male students. I hadn't

05:08.925 --> 05:14.213
known about that to that point, or I might have 
considered a different university. In those

05:14.632 --> 05:36.103
days, the Southern Baptists made a big deal out of 
the fact that they didn't accept any foreign aid,

05:14.632 --> 05:36.103
any federal aid, to them it was foreign aid, but any 
federal aid from, well, any aid from the U.S.

05:14.632 --> 05:36.103
government, and therefore would be able to keep 
their universities pure from any kind of federal

05:14.632 --> 05:36.103
influence. What they did, however, was they kind 
of pawned or or hawked their freshman and

05:41.243 --> 05:55.557
sophomore students, made them take ROTC, and 
therefore collected a bounty of X dollars per head

05:41.243 --> 05:55.557
for every freshman and sophomore male student. It 
was kind of a backdoor way of getting federal aid,

05:55.838 --> 06:01.243
and I was a pawn in that game. A good many of my fellow 
students decided to take the junior and senior

06:02.464 --> 06:09.411
year of ROTC, which meant they got a nice monthly 
stipend. The only problem, of course, it wasn't a

06:13.040 --> 06:31.163
very big problem in 1963 or late 1962 or 1963 when 
they were deciding to do this, was that they would,

06:13.040 --> 06:31.163
in fact, have to spend two years in the Army. But no 
one thought much about that in 1962-63. There were

06:35.076 --> 06:44.289
some miscellaneous skirmishes going on in some 
place called Indochina, but nobody paid much

06:35.076 --> 06:44.289
attention to it. Unfortunately, our class 
graduated in 1964, and some of the people who had

06:44.930 --> 06:56.307
thought they'd pursue a kind of a quiet, calm 
career of a couple of maybe four years in the Army

06:56.742 --> 07:01.429
got some rather rude surprises. In fact, some of 
them, by 1966, by the time they would have retired

07:01.449 --> 07:10.181
from the service, in 1968, were dead. Did you fight 
in the Vietnam War? No, I didn't fight in the

07:13.506 --> 07:15.509
Vietnam War. I chose not to go into the advanced 
ROTC. I didn't like the military discipline of the

07:20.976 --> 07:24.201
first two years. and thought that there were 
better ways to spend my time. And I never did... I

07:31.558 --> 07:32.399
never did... I saw no military service at all in the 
60s. How did you get out of serving in the war? It was

07:40.867 --> 07:41.608
very complicated. For the first thing, I mean, 
there were a whole series of circumstances. The

07:46.132 --> 07:54.019
first thing is that I was married shortly before 
and therefore had what was then called a 2A

07:54.455 --> 08:05.707
deferment shortly before President Johnson 
canceled the deferment. It was really quite just

08:06.508 --> 08:19.282
happenstance that that

08:06.508 --> 08:19.282
deferment was canceled shortly after I was 
married. So I had the 2A. That, I had the feeling,

08:22.568 --> 08:26.793
would not have gotten me through the war. I was also 
a 2S, which was a student deferment, and in fact was

08:28.135 --> 08:36.945
in graduate school for quite a number of years. I 
mean, the standard amount of time one takes to

08:37.005 --> 08:42.652
pursue a Ph.D., which in my case was about six 
years. And I have a feeling, however, that a much

08:43.753 --> 08:51.242
more important factor was that my draft board was 
in San Antonio. And I have a feeling that I profited

08:51.965 --> 09:16.990
from the fact, that is, I benefited from the fact 
that there were lots of poor Hispanic males in San

08:51.965 --> 09:16.990
Antonio who could be drafted, and that they didn't 
have to dip into the pool of people who were in

08:51.965 --> 09:16.990
school quite so far, pursuing higher educations, 
quite so far in San Antonio because of the pool they

08:51.965 --> 09:16.990
had there. That's a hunch. I've never been able to 
document that, nor have I tried. but it certainly

09:20.416 --> 09:26.303
is a reasonable hypothesis, I think. Did you 
support the war? At the very first, I suppose, in

09:28.466 --> 09:47.048
1965,

09:28.466 --> 09:47.048
I thought that it was a good idea to, being rather 
naive about the history of the area, I thought that

09:47.433 --> 10:00.129
a larger military presence was required and that 
the thing could have gotten over with rather

09:47.433 --> 10:00.129
quickly if there had been a larger commitment. I 
had the good fortune, however, to, I was attending

10:00.649 --> 10:16.309
a Baptist church in Austin at the time, this was 
about 1965, and was, no, wait, I'm sorry, this is

10:00.649 --> 10:16.309
the fall, in fact, of 1964. I was attending Baptist 
Church there near the university, which was, I

10:17.065 --> 10:26.858
suppose, the university church, really quite a 
liberal one by Southern Baptist standards. And

10:27.779 --> 10:40.696
the assistant minister there, who was quite a 
liberal sort, asked me to conduct a discussion

10:27.779 --> 10:40.696
group on what was then called the Indochina 
question. Being a person who felt the need to

10:42.178 --> 10:46.043
research topics before I led discussion groups. I 
went to the library and read a bunch of books on

10:48.919 --> 10:56.728
Indochina, on Vietnamese history. I was 
especially interested in books by Bernard Fall,

10:56.748 --> 11:11.085
who had been a student of that part of the world for 
many years, a French correspondent, who in fact

10:56.748 --> 11:11.085
had an advanced degree in Indochina studies. And 
during the course of that semester, as a matter of

11:11.865 --> 11:15.810
fact, my views really changed from supporting the 
war to

11:17.242 --> 11:31.942
profound doubt that the war was winnable and that 
it was advisable. I often thought later that if

11:32.603 --> 11:44.999
everybody in America had had the occasion to go to 
the library and read a few books on Vietnam, maybe

11:32.603 --> 11:44.999
things would have been a little different much 
earlier. Why did you become against it? Well,

11:47.819 --> 12:16.830
Bernard Fall and the other people who I read 
convinced me that it was a civil war, that the

11:47.819 --> 12:16.830
menace of communism was in fact not so much 
anything that was threatening to the United

11:47.819 --> 12:16.830
States as it was a kind of difference of opinion 
about the way that the Vietnamese should conduct

11:47.819 --> 12:16.830
their affairs. and that the Vietnamese had no 
tradition of democracy such as we had in this

12:17.401 --> 12:35.183
country and they therefore were being presented 
in ways by the government and by the media that were

12:17.401 --> 12:35.183
pretty much false. So I began to think that the

12:36.585 --> 12:45.957
problem was a a local one rather than a global one. I 
wasn't actively opposed to the war at that point,

12:50.342 --> 12:58.213
but I did have serious doubts about American 
involvement in it. I wasn't by any means out

12:58.293 --> 13:04.101
demonstrating in 1964, and as far as I know, no one 
else was either. But I began to take the issue very

13:05.302 --> 13:09.328
seriously, had discussions with my friends, I 
still would not say I was a dove. Some of my friends

13:12.613 --> 13:13.535
were. In fact, some of my friends were much further 
to the left on that issue than I was at that point.

13:19.045 --> 13:29.865
But at least it opened up ways of talking to people 
because I at least began to have an informed

13:19.045 --> 13:29.865
opinion as opposed to just an opinion. What did you 
do besides discussion groups to be actively

13:31.634 --> 13:36.000
against it? In 1964, not very much, because things 
were fairly low-key in 1964. By the time the war

13:41.928 --> 13:47.636
began to heat up, we began to have demonstrations. 
I don't remember the year this occurred, but I can

13:49.818 --> 14:01.354
remember being in one of the first, taking part in 
one of the first anti-war demonstrations in

13:49.818 --> 14:01.354
Austin. It was a march up Congress Avenue from the 
river. There couldn't have been more than 50

14:06.583 --> 14:13.354
people, and there were people throwing things at 
us from the sidewalk.

14:15.899 --> 14:28.219
The numbers are very small, and really we were 
considered a very radical group, although today

14:15.899 --> 14:28.219
it would not be considered terribly radical to do 
that. There was difficulty getting parade

14:29.144 --> 14:33.230
permits for unpopular causes. And in fact, that 
experience has really profoundly affected my

14:33.250 --> 14:45.167
views about the First Amendment and the 
importance of the First Amendment. So that, for

14:45.187 --> 14:55.962
instance, later when the Klan wanted to march in 
Skokie, Illinois, I basically supported their

14:45.187 --> 14:55.962
right to do it, despite the fact that I think the 
Klan a bunch of scum. It seems to me that even scum

14:58.128 --> 15:02.174
are protected by the First Amendment. So that was 
very formative. To have people hurl epithets and

15:04.217 --> 15:11.367
physical objects at you for expressing your view 
was a very important experience.

15:13.891 --> 15:15.774
What were your ideas on civil rights? Well, civil 
rights was an issue which had been very much a part

15:16.735 --> 15:24.126
of the American scene even when I was in college. I 
wasn't involved very much in that in the 1960s

15:27.702 --> 15:35.711
because the issue was not really a big issue in 
Abilene, Texas.

15:38.735 --> 15:42.179
Ethnic minorities in Abilene were a minimum. 
There were very few blacks, and so, I mean, Abilene

15:42.419 --> 15:47.225
is really not a part of the South. It's a part of the 
West, and so I suppose my my interest in that. I've

15:55.359 --> 16:09.354
got to also add that I really grew up in what might be 
called Mexican Texas or Hispanic Texas rather

15:55.359 --> 16:09.354
than the portions of Texas that had a good number of 
black people. So I was really more aware of

16:09.374 --> 16:16.661
discrimination against Hispanics than aware of 
discrimination against blacks. And therefore it

16:17.562 --> 16:19.324
really wasn't until I went to Austin, and I began to 
be interested in that issue that really had been

16:19.945 --> 16:28.334
part of the American scene for some time. When I 
moved to Austin in 1964, the Paramount Theater was

16:30.496 --> 16:34.360
still segregated. The black people had to sit 
upstairs in the balcony, and there were

16:35.100 --> 16:39.725
demonstrations. I didn't take part in any of those 
demonstrations, but I was aware of them and was

16:39.805 --> 16:47.573
very sympathetic toward the demonstrators.

16:49.628 --> 16:56.017
Did a person have to have long hair and do drugs to be 
considered in during the 60s? No, not at all. Some

16:58.220 --> 17:18.589
of my best friends, in fact, in the SDS, the 
Students for a Democratic Society, had short hair

16:58.220 --> 17:18.589
and they wore sports coats and ties and didn't do 
drugs because they wanted to look as normal as

16:58.220 --> 17:18.589
possible, in quotes, so that they could have the 
greatest political effect. So they thought of

17:19.750 --> 17:27.120
themselves as kind of wearing protective 
coloring, so to speak, in order to get their ideas

17:19.750 --> 17:27.120
out. So that certainly would be false to say that. 
And in fact, I don't think that long hair was by any

17:33.508 --> 17:44.523
means a badge of honor. It seemed to me always just a 
matter of personal taste. It may have, I mean, it

17:48.337 --> 18:01.412
certainly had to do something with the freedom to 
be different that was being expressed and kind of a

17:48.337 --> 18:01.412
reaction against the stereotypes that we'd grown 
up with. But I don't know that it was, I don't know

18:02.493 --> 18:14.707
that it was for me ever a member of joining a club as 
it was just something different to try and see if I

18:02.493 --> 18:14.707
liked it. What is your definition of a hippie? 
Well, hippie is a term that was invented by Time

18:18.543 --> 18:41.800
Magazine, and if I could quote Joe Krupa, who's now 
the chair of the English department at the

18:18.543 --> 18:41.800
University of Texas, and who was a young hip 
faculty member when I was there, that probably has

18:18.543 --> 18:41.800
never been a hippie.

18:42.809 --> 18:53.283
It's a term that was invented by Time Magazine and, 
like a lot of other words that purport to refer, I'm

18:42.809 --> 18:53.283
not sure it does. What is clear is that there began 
to be alternate lifestyles expressed in the

18:53.864 --> 19:01.894
1960s. And if you want to call those people 
hippies, well, that's fine, but you just have to

19:02.755 --> 19:12.428
spend a lot of time defining your terms and say what 
you mean by it. So I have no definition because I'm

19:12.897 --> 19:21.146
not sure the term really works very well. So did you 
have your hair long? I wore my hair long for quite a

19:23.689 --> 19:26.092
number of years. And in fact, when I got a job at 
Texas A&M, my hair was probably almost as long as

19:26.492 --> 19:34.461
yours. That means shoulder length. Yes. When did 
you first see people with these alternate

19:39.661 --> 19:43.545
lifestyles? And what was your impression of them? 
Well, Austin in 1964, 1965

19:45.547 --> 20:05.449
was beginning to have people who, well actually I 
guess 65, 66 was beginning to have people who were

19:45.547 --> 20:05.449
in touch with friends on the West Coast.

20:05.733 --> 20:12.501
There were people who had come from the West Coast, 
from the Berkeley area, to Austin in the

20:05.733 --> 20:12.501
mid-1960s, I guess around 1965. And I remember the 
opening of the first Rock Palace, which was

20:13.542 --> 20:21.871
anything but a palace. It was an old kind of dumpy 
storefront on Congress Avenue. And what was the

20:27.197 --> 20:28.779
name of the place? Well,

20:28.959 --> 20:34.525
I can't even remember now, but it was a place that 
really had the first people with extremely long

20:35.028 --> 20:41.575
hair, I guess, that I'd seen. Although that's not 
quite true. Actually, people began to come

20:44.858 --> 20:58.993
through there, but as a matter of fact, in 1965 or 
1966, I guess it was, a friend and I went, when was

20:44.858 --> 20:58.993
the Summer of Peace and Love? I can't even remember 
now, whatever year that was, in Haight-Ashbury.

21:04.019 --> 21:17.102
Some friends and I actually drove out to 
California to see what was going on, and of course

21:04.019 --> 21:17.102
there were several people with long hair and beads 
and love signs, peace signs, and so on then. But

21:17.583 --> 21:26.719
gradually more and more people, there was always a 
lot of commerce between the West Coast and Austin,

21:17.583 --> 21:26.719
even before the 60s. Austin was on the music scene, 
kind of the college music scene. I mean, if you were

21:31.197 --> 21:44.279
going to make a tour, it would include not only 
Berklee and other places, but Austin, Little

21:31.197 --> 21:44.279
Rock, and so it was on that circuit that went from 
the west coast to the east coast and back. I mean,

21:45.902 --> 21:53.314
there were a lot of people from the west coast 
coming in. When you saw these people in

21:53.969 --> 21:56.932
California, what did you think of them? I mean, did 
you laugh at them, or did you want to be a part of

21:57.493 --> 22:00.696
them? No, by no means. I was fascinated with the... 
I mean, I've always been interested in things that

22:04.700 --> 22:14.470
were different, and so I've always thought that we 
don't have all the answers, no matter how we live or

22:04.700 --> 22:14.470
what we do. So I was fascinated by the whole 
business. I stayed in California for, I guess, a

22:16.432 --> 22:23.419
week or so, and met people, talked to people, and I 
listened to some of the music that some of the

22:24.142 --> 22:30.008
groups out there were beginning to play. I 
remember the first time I heard Country Joe and the

22:30.328 --> 22:32.871
Fish. It was quite a wonderful experience. I

22:34.653 --> 22:49.828
saw the cultural phenomenon as one that had a lot of 
interest, and who knows what it would do. Could you

22:51.935 --> 22:54.818
define what a radical is? Well, of course, the 
dictionary definition of a radical is someone who

22:55.759 --> 23:01.366
wants to go to the root of the matter. And what that 
comes down to in any particular social and

23:02.367 --> 23:16.543
political unit or society is, well, it'll differ 
from society to society. I suppose if you were... a

23:20.588 --> 23:29.418
radical during the 1960s, it meant that you were 
deeply distrustful of the US government. You felt

23:30.059 --> 23:31.461
you'd been lied to. You felt that there was a basic 
unfairness about the way that minorities were

23:33.163 --> 23:45.938
being treated, about the way that you were being 
treated if you were up for the draft. and that the

23:46.525 --> 23:57.837
government was no longer really responding to the 
problems that were apparent and that something

23:46.525 --> 23:57.837
radical or drastic needed to be done. That took 
different forms for different people. You said

24:03.403 --> 24:05.265
you joined SDS? No, I never joined SDS. I had a good 
number of friends in SDS, but I was never a member.

24:09.850 --> 24:11.211
Why didn't you join SDS? I was busy being a graduate 
student. I didn't join anything, basically. I

24:16.664 --> 24:19.709
wasn't a member of any clubs or groups when I was a 
graduate student. I was working very hard. It's

24:22.252 --> 24:25.097
not that I was in graduate school for a deferment. I 
had a deferment because I was in graduate school.

24:29.483 --> 24:46.148
Even though I was active politically in terms of 
supporting friends who were involved with

24:29.483 --> 24:46.148
political activities and involved myself in 
marches and did whatever I could, I saw the

24:29.483 --> 24:46.148
political kind of thing that was going on as part of 
a broader cultural manifestation. So

24:52.369 --> 24:56.755
I really didn't join any groups. Why didn't you 
join these groups? I really didn't have the time to

25:01.481 --> 25:06.307
be an active member of any of the groups. I 
preferred to

25:12.858 --> 25:25.661
be a part, that is, on the edge of several groups 
without actually getting into the

25:12.858 --> 25:25.661
organizational or administrative aspects of it. 
I did not think that I had the time to be a leader in

25:25.842 --> 25:35.980
any kind of political or cultural manifestation 
because I was working very hard being a graduate

25:25.842 --> 25:35.980
student. Well, when you look back on your years at 
the University of Texas, can you remember some of

25:37.411 --> 25:45.403
the radical events that you witnessed or 
participated in? Oh, sure. I can remember the

25:46.385 --> 25:50.972
radical events. I guess you mean some of the things 
that really occurred either on a large scale that

25:51.032 --> 26:03.672
indicated satisfaction with the status quo or 
something of that sort. I remember very clearly

26:04.090 --> 26:13.139
the day that the students demonstrated against 
the invasion of Cambodia. And I don't remember the

26:13.159 --> 26:14.241
year. We could look it up. It must have been 67, 68, 
maybe. Well, actually, it was later than that. It

26:20.287 --> 26:23.710
was Nixon, so it would have to have been later, 69, 
70. The demonstrations against that formed a line

26:24.751 --> 26:33.000
of people four or six abreast that started off by 
the Student Union Building in Austin, went all the

26:33.925 --> 26:53.446
way down to the Capitol, which is 12th Street, 
which is some eight or nine blocks away, and then

26:33.925 --> 26:53.446
came back up to the east side of the campus, to the 
Littlefield Fountain. And there were so many

26:53.767 --> 26:58.532
people that by the time the first bunch were 
getting to the fountain, the last bunch were just

26:58.765 --> 27:04.111
beginning to leave the student center. And that's 
a lot of people. I mean, one could estimate maybe

27:06.574 --> 27:12.001
25,000 people marching that day. That's quite 
remarkable. I do remember other demonstrations

27:14.624 --> 27:26.258
at which I suppose the most dangerous one I 
witnessed was the at the time that there were

27:26.795 --> 27:43.798
several speeches made on the steps of the 
administration building at the University of

27:26.795 --> 27:43.798
Texas, and there was one particular speaker who 
encouraged everybody to march on the state

27:26.795 --> 27:43.798
capitol. And as it turned out, the administration 
got wind of that and posted a line of Texas Rangers

27:54.065 --> 28:02.337
and DPS troopers at the base of the plaza there in 
front of the administration building. They were

28:02.878 --> 28:10.168
heavily armed, and there were some very tense 
moments at that point.

28:11.750 --> 28:21.304
I'm kind of a political pragmatist, and I thought 
that the calls for action that were advanced by

28:11.750 --> 28:21.304
some of my fellow students were just a little bit 
foolish, and that the same kind of results could

28:21.740 --> 28:39.965
have been achieved by means that would not have the 
seeds of violence. It seemed to me, even at the

28:41.427 --> 28:45.071
time, that violence was not a very good solution to 
any of the problems. I mean, that's what we were

28:45.091 --> 28:48.456
against, right? So that for people who were 
claiming that we should, quote, bring war home, I

28:49.010 --> 28:57.403
didn't have much sympathy for that. Do you 
remember the LBJ library being built in a protest

28:57.423 --> 29:01.849
against that? Yeah, sure. In fact,

29:03.191 --> 29:09.160
there were protests against that. There were 
protests against much of the building project

29:09.181 --> 29:16.131
that was going on during that time. that was 
initiated by Frank Irwin, who was the head of the

29:16.567 --> 29:21.654
Board of Regents at that time. The students and 
Frank Irwin didn't get along at all. In fact, he

29:24.939 --> 29:30.346
called a group of them a bunch of dirty nothings at 
some point. And that became a quite popular phrase

29:30.927 --> 29:34.192
around the university. People were describing 
themselves as dirty nothings. And yeah, I

29:37.777 --> 29:41.342
remember that. And in fact, I was back at the 
University of Texas as a faculty member the day,

29:41.980 --> 29:53.220
the year that the LBJ Library was dedicated. And I 
had an office overlooking, or with a view of the LBJ

29:53.240 --> 30:02.436
Library, I went up to go to work on a Saturday, and 
there was a guy in a blue suit with sunglasses and

30:02.804 --> 30:16.364
saddle oxfords with a white button-down shirt 
telling me I couldn't go to my office. Apparently

30:16.845 --> 30:28.523
my window had a little too clear a view of the place 
where LBJ was going to make his speech, so they just

30:16.845 --> 30:28.523
told me I'd have to come back later. And did you? I 
didn't argue with them. When did you first think

30:33.398 --> 30:37.523
about women's liberation? Well, that's 
difficult to answer because it's not real clear

30:39.005 --> 30:53.602
exactly

30:39.005 --> 30:53.602
when women's liberation began to be a term. The 
history of the women's movement, of course, goes

30:54.263 --> 31:00.411
back a long way. But if the question is, When did I 
become aware that there were serious deficits in

31:02.795 --> 31:12.906
our society, serious deficiencies in our society 
regarding the way that women are treated? I

31:14.087 --> 31:21.415
suppose that was also about the time that I was in 
Austin. I didn't really think a whole lot about

31:22.275 --> 31:28.562
that when I was in Abilene because, well, things 
were very quiet in Abilene. There really wasn't

31:29.083 --> 31:32.346
much stimulation to thinking. you just kind of did 
your thing and you got your degree and there really

31:32.933 --> 31:40.022
wasn't much intellectual stimulation.

31:41.764 --> 31:59.886
I began to be aware of that really much more from 
1964 on, and I think partially as a consequence of

31:41.764 --> 31:59.886
meeting women and getting to know women who were 
dissatisfied with their situation and had

31:41.764 --> 31:59.886
legitimate gripes. And it was really impossible 
not to have a great deal of sympathy and to come to

32:00.338 --> 32:09.170
see their side of things. What did you think about 
women before their movement? Before the... I'm

32:13.836 --> 32:14.417
sorry. Before the women's liberation movement. 
What did you think? Did you think that their place

32:17.962 --> 32:19.624
was in the home? Or what did you think? Well, I 
wouldn't say that I ever thought that. But... I

32:30.460 --> 32:56.248
would say I had a much more traditional view of 
matters, not necessarily that the woman's place

32:30.460 --> 32:56.248
should be in the home, but let's just say that I 
didn't see the possibilities for

32:30.460 --> 32:56.248
the kind of self-actualization of women in our 
society that I began to see later. You've got to

32:56.515 --> 33:07.309
remember that Hardin-Simmons, for all of its 
faults, had a very strong tradition of women who

32:56.515 --> 33:07.309
went out and did things. They were missionaries, 
and they were all kinds of religious leaders, and

33:07.429 --> 33:14.237
they didn't depend on a lot of men to help them do it. 
So there was that strong tradition among the

33:14.878 --> 33:25.932
Southern Baptists that by George, if a young woman 
wanted to train to be a missionary in Nigeria,

33:14.878 --> 33:25.932
she'd didn't particularly need the help of a young 
man to do it. It would be nice if she could marry

33:30.066 --> 33:36.792
somebody who was interested in that sort of thing, 
but by gum, she could just go do it herself. And so

33:37.473 --> 33:41.697
there was that dimension that was there even then. 
What impact did Women's Lib have on your life? Oh

33:47.803 --> 33:49.886
boy, that's a very large question. And I guess it 
would be difficult to answer since it's still

33:55.493 --> 33:57.075
going on. To tell you the truth, I just don't even 
know how to answer the question.

34:09.648 --> 34:22.682
I include

34:09.648 --> 34:22.682
components in my courses now on feminist issues 
and try to be as sensitive as possible to the kinds

34:22.966 --> 34:31.056
of grievances that women in their society have. 
I've been a member of the National Organization

34:31.617 --> 34:34.821
for Women for several years. And apart from that, 
though, it would be very hard to

34:35.662 --> 34:45.615
sum up that kind of changes in a brief time, because 
it's just been very extensive. Do you foresee any

34:51.693 --> 34:57.942
of the 1960s idealism and freedom to do your own 
thing for the 1990s? Well, I don't know if it's

34:59.204 --> 35:02.950
going to come in the 1990s or not. I hope it will. I 
hoped it would in the 1980s, and I hoped it would in

35:05.293 --> 35:09.700
the 1970s. I hoped it would continue. because I 
think idealism, especially among young people,

35:12.207 --> 35:22.523
is very good and that it's something that can be 
mobilized for great advantage. But don't you

35:24.666 --> 35:26.970
think that it can let people down? I mean, if you 
have idealism, then you can just kind of be let

35:26.990 --> 35:30.115
down? Well, you certainly can, and I'm not sure 
there's anything that one does that doesn't allow

35:30.956 --> 35:37.887
for being let down at some point. But it seems to me 
that... During the 1960s, when young men and women

35:41.215 --> 36:07.341
were going off to the Peace Corps and they were 
getting into careers in academics that they

35:41.215 --> 36:07.341
thought were important, even though perhaps 
low-paying, and they believed that one should be

35:41.215 --> 36:07.341
aware of social issues and try to make a change for 
the better, and they were paying attention to

35:41.215 --> 36:07.341
Kennedy's famous remark that they should ask what 
they could do for their country. It seemed to me

36:10.060 --> 36:32.203
that that was a better time, certainly better one 
than a time during which the primary goal is to get a

36:10.060 --> 36:32.203
high-paying job immediately after college and to 
put blinders on in a way that makes one unaware of

36:10.060 --> 36:32.203
the social problems around one. So I would welcome 
a new upthrust of of idealism and hope that it

36:37.358 --> 36:45.510
wouldn't be too long before we saw it again.

36:45.670 --> 36:50.257
What is the impact on the counterculture on 
American society? Well, I think it's very

36:50.417 --> 36:52.480
profound. And I think that there's a sense in which 
the 60s have really never receded.

37:02.907 --> 37:17.329
America is a much more pluralistic place than it 
was prior to the 60s,

37:02.907 --> 37:17.329
not only ethnically in terms of the awareness that 
people have of other cultures. I mean, we think of

37:17.429 --> 37:22.216
ourselves as a culture now in a way that we didn't 
before the 1960s. We think of ourselves as a as a

37:26.768 --> 37:32.237
society in which there are lots of different 
groups competing for all kinds of different

37:26.768 --> 37:32.237
things. But prior to the 1960s, that perception 
was much smaller because it didn't include a lot of

37:32.838 --> 37:40.872
people that it includes now. I think also in terms 
of the arts, in terms of lifestyles, the freedom to

37:50.056 --> 37:52.599
pursue alternative lifestyles. For instance, 
before the 1960s, you really didn't see very many

37:54.181 --> 38:09.261
people

37:54.181 --> 38:09.261
working out non-traditional ways of living 
together.

38:12.505 --> 38:14.207
You didn't see groups of people getting together 
and living together as you have recently begun to

38:14.862 --> 38:29.840
see in certain places like the West Coast among 
people who are, say, in their 60s or 70s for mutual

38:14.862 --> 38:29.840
aid and creating new kinds of families. So my point 
here, then, is that a lot of different models were

38:30.361 --> 38:42.355
tried out in the 1960s, and some of them didn't work 
very well, and some of them worked pretty well and

38:42.689 --> 38:46.715
they were retained and we still got a lot of that 
stuff going on now. I think that the arts are much

38:48.918 --> 38:54.366
more open as a result of changes in the 1960s. That 
we've learned some lessons, we learned some

38:55.487 --> 39:09.287
lessons in the 60s about freedom of expression and 
individual rights or individual liberties that

38:55.487 --> 39:09.287
we still haven't forgotten. And there was an 
experimentalism then that we still retain

39:09.841 --> 39:16.613
important vestiges of. The problem is that all of 
this kind of exists below a rather thick layer of

39:18.497 --> 39:32.322
greed in the 1980s, and in fact a thick layer of 
scandalous behavior. And that's truly

39:32.943 --> 39:36.448
unfortunate. And maybe we can get, I don't know, 
maybe during the 90s, people who really care about

39:36.569 --> 39:51.912
each other and about the society and about the 
environment can get the country back from the

39:36.569 --> 39:51.912
bastards who've been kind of taking advantage of 
the rest of us. I don't know. It depends on whether

39:52.873 --> 39:57.400
we've got the guts to do it or not. Overall, in your 
opinion, what is the impact of radicals on

39:57.420 --> 40:01.887
American society? Well, again, the term radical 
is a very vague one for me, and I'm not sure exactly

40:03.470 --> 40:10.076
what it means.

40:14.519 --> 40:19.824
I suppose one could approach the question by 
asking, where are the old radicals of the 1960s?

40:20.504 --> 40:23.847
And of course, some of the greatest ones are not 
with us anymore. Jerry Rubin is no longer around.

40:27.210 --> 40:33.055
Tom Hayden is still a congressman in California. I 
think that the radicals, I think that there's a

40:33.912 --> 40:50.039
basic problem with being a radical, and that is 
that you have to make a case that's so extreme that

40:33.912 --> 40:50.039
its time in play sometimes is very short. It seems 
to me that even though the model may seem somewhat

40:52.402 --> 41:00.696
simplistic, things do tend to operate in pendulum 
swings. And a radical may be, the message of a

41:01.132 --> 41:12.628
radical may in fact be only relevant when the 
pendulum is at the extreme positions. It doesn't

41:13.188 --> 41:20.238
mean we can't learn from these people, but what it 
usually means is that their position is not one

41:13.188 --> 41:20.238
that works over the long run. It seems to me that 
people who've really made more of a difference in

41:22.761 --> 41:29.991
the long run in the American society have been 
people who have taken ideas from radicals from all

41:30.494 --> 41:44.473
persuasions, all parts of the political and 
social spectrum, and found ways of sorting out

41:30.494 --> 41:44.473
what was good from what was bad. And so in this 
regard, I guess I'm a real pragmatist, trying to

41:44.834 --> 41:56.670
find things that work as opposed to trying to find 
things that fit an ideology. And one final

41:58.439 --> 41:59.701
question. What do you think the impact of the 1960s 
is on us now? Well, I think that's what it is. I think

42:06.870 --> 42:22.590
that we're more experimental and we're probably 
able to listen to a wider diversity of viewpoints

42:06.870 --> 42:22.590
and we're willing to try out things that weren't 
previously even considered.

42:24.410 --> 42:28.194
I hope that those effects will continue. I think 
they'll almost have to, because I think that the

42:28.995 --> 42:42.391
1960s brought in what can only be termed a real 
cultural revolution. And I don't mean just in

42:43.092 --> 42:48.358
terms of the clothes people wore and how they wore 
their hair and so on, because a lot of that's gone.

42:48.819 --> 42:53.404
But cultural revolution in the sense of the way 
that we perceive ourselves as

42:53.890 --> 43:13.219
not so much fixed anymore and not so much as a 
society that's finished somehow and we just need

42:53.890 --> 43:13.219
to do some fine-tuning, but one that really in 
which active, ongoing experimentation is really

42:53.890 --> 43:13.219
important. I think that's a very rich heritage 
from the 1960s. Thank you very, very much. Thank

43:19.409 --> 43:19.729
you.

47:04.973 --> 47:13.161
Hi, I'm Kelly Wood, and this is December 6th, and 
I'm interviewing Larry Hickman concerning the

47:04.973 --> 47:13.161
60s movement.
