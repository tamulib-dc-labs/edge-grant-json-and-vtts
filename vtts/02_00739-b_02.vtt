WEBVTT

00:02.798 --> 00:11.969
That was at the Journal of the American Society, I 
mean the American Society... American Medical

00:02.798 --> 00:11.969
Association, in the ophthalmology section. 
Uh-huh. And that's where you made your first major

00:13.912 --> 00:21.681
defense in your... Well, yeah, except in the 
literature now. I first published in the Journal

00:22.002 --> 00:26.567
of Heredity, you see. But I also published in 
the...

00:31.958 --> 00:36.925
American Sideround Production, 1934, somewhere 
along in there. That must be the journal, that's

00:36.965 --> 00:38.788
the journal. That's the Journal of Heredity. 
Yeah. Yeah, that's March of 33. Yeah. Okay, now

00:43.615 --> 00:47.020
here's the Journal of Ophthalmology, December 
35. That's the one that you have there. And then

00:50.585 --> 00:55.873
here's one on the same subject from the Texas State 
Journal of Medicine in 37. That's where you were

01:00.237 --> 01:01.899
invited to give the speech. In Fort Worth. Fort 
Worth, uh-huh. And there's American Society of

01:04.522 --> 01:06.243
Animal Production, I guess. Well, this is from the 
Proceedings of the American Society of Animal

01:07.084 --> 01:10.468
Production. Yeah, that's 34, right? Where'd you 
get all this stuff? Well, you must have given those

01:14.012 --> 01:18.837
either to Mr. Colfer or to Ernest Langford, wasn't 
it? I gave it to Ernest Langford, yeah. I remember

01:19.958 --> 01:21.620
now he asked me for all that stuff. Mm-hmm. And then 
I have... What does that one mean? That's a

01:24.416 --> 01:26.700
clipping from the Eagle in 1960. It is. Uh-huh. And 
that's about you and some of your work and somebody

01:29.606 --> 01:42.328
from the University of Cincinnati by the name of 
Workany, A-R-K-A-N-Y. Yeah, he also... You see,

01:42.389 --> 01:47.157
when... When this came out, a lot of these other 
schools started projects of their own, and he took

01:47.542 --> 01:52.689
up rats. And he tried on other vitamins, I think B1 
or something. And so Warneke gave us credit for

01:58.236 --> 02:05.525
starting a lot of tests for other schools like 
that.

02:08.449 --> 02:13.515
And he mentioned somewhere in the article, I don't 
know who wrote the article, I imagine somebody in

02:08.449 --> 02:13.515
here took it. at school and said something about 
that you had letters from a lot of people who either

02:13.681 --> 02:21.347
questioned your results. I only had one who 
questioned it. Most scientists won't do that, you

02:24.550 --> 02:26.392
see. Well, most of them, I guess, were 
corroborating your work and praising you for it.

02:31.716 --> 02:34.639
Yeah, they were. But you know it doesn't pay to say 
something isn't so anymore. No, it really

02:39.483 --> 02:42.445
doesn't. I want to show you Here's a book written 
by...

02:55.694 --> 03:00.659
Nutrition and Physical Regeneration by Price, 
and he got our work in there, see there? He starts in

03:03.222 --> 03:05.624
there.

03:08.247 --> 03:13.793
One thing about it that they can't take away, A&M 
College gets credit for starting this kind of

03:08.247 --> 03:13.793
work. And that's what pleases me, A&M College. I 
think a lot of A&M. Well, that means a whole lot more

03:20.778 --> 03:23.642
than you know than me. Well, I think that in your 
time, you were talking earlier about some of the

03:25.064 --> 03:39.426
other people who were here, like Dean Pereira and 
Dr. Francis and so forth, and I think that Although

03:39.895 --> 03:50.151
I never met them, I had the idea, perhaps, that they 
had a lot of same feelings that you did, that they

03:39.895 --> 03:50.151
put the college before themselves. Well, that's 
what I'd like to do. Now, there's that exhibit at

03:54.237 --> 03:56.000
Fort Worth there. Oh, this is when you gave us the 
speech. Now, if I didn't give Langford one of them,

03:59.205 --> 04:02.510
you can put that in your folder. No, I don't have one 
of those.

04:12.464 --> 04:13.045
You want that? Now,

04:15.729 --> 04:23.181
is this the one that, is this the article you got? I 
believe it is, yeah. Same one. Right. Yeah.

04:39.066 --> 04:39.687
I'll tell you,

04:45.117 --> 04:46.679
Did you have one of these? No, I do not. I would like 
very much to have one of those. Well, you can have

04:51.245 --> 04:52.387
this one. Okay. Now, I've written on, since this 
was written,

04:52.767 --> 05:05.405
they awarded me this title of fella. You haven't 
got anything on that either. Yeah, I have a

05:08.369 --> 05:09.871
clipping on that, 63. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. That was 
the American Society of Animal Science that

05:11.892 --> 05:16.618
awarded you the honorary medal. Yes. Uh-huh. Have 
you got about the honorary member of the Saturn

05:17.359 --> 05:21.885
Swirling Club here, the X-ray man? I'll just put it 
down there. No. Well, here.

05:29.254 --> 05:31.818
You haven't got one of these, have you? Saturn 
Swirling Club? I have some of them. I'm not sure

05:33.860 --> 05:34.802
they have that one. This is a...

05:43.133 --> 05:47.319
was kind of got a little careless and put my name on 
there. You must have been one of the early members

05:48.901 --> 05:51.165
of that, were you not? Yes. I forget right now just 
exactly when it was started. Now, here's another.

06:01.019 --> 06:02.701
Do you need anything like this? This is a bulletin 
we got on cutting seed mills. Well, I was going to

06:05.493 --> 06:08.517
get around to asking you that sooner or later. 
Well, you take this one. And then here's one on

06:11.401 --> 06:14.746
fraud investigations in Texas from 1888 to 1957. 
You stick that in here. Okay. I think you probably

06:21.355 --> 06:25.982
retired before I came so that I retired in 65. So I 
came in 71. You did? I haven't had a chance to write

06:29.979 --> 06:33.984
you a congratulatory letter upon your retirement 
as I do now. When people retire now, I write them a

06:34.925 --> 06:43.996
congratulatory letter and I say I'm interested in 
any of their papers that they have, like any

06:34.925 --> 06:43.996
bulletins or articles they've written and things 
like that. We have some of yours and we'd be happy to

06:44.016 --> 06:47.320
add these others to it. I think I'll give you some of 
these letters here. We haven't talked about this

06:53.487 --> 06:54.889
yet, but In putting rations together, there's a 
method called Pearson Square. I don't know

07:02.014 --> 07:03.996
whether you ever heard of it or not. No. But Dierman 
used it a whole lot. But it's the editing thing

07:05.939 --> 07:12.888
called Pearson Square. Say you wanted to make a 15% 
ration and put that in the square, and you're going

07:12.948 --> 07:27.087
to use a grain that has 10% crude protein, and this 
is crude protein. And you've got a supplement that

07:27.573 --> 07:30.977
has 60% crude protein like tannocates.

07:35.363 --> 07:44.233
Now, what you do is, for this to work, one of these 
corners has got to be smaller than this, and one's

07:35.363 --> 07:44.233
got to be larger than this. Now, how much grain and 
supplement do you put together to get this? See,

07:49.119 --> 07:50.221
that's the question. And this method here is 
called Pearson Square. Well, this and that's 45.

07:56.699 --> 07:57.880
And this and that's five. So that makes 50, but you 
want 100 pounds, say, so you multiply it by two.

08:03.385 --> 08:05.146
This will go in 102. It'll be 90 pounds of grain and 
10 pounds of supper. Well, now, how do you know

08:10.231 --> 08:11.392
that'll work? Well, 10% of 90 is nine, and 60% of 10 
is six. That's 15, and you've got 100 pounds. So,

08:21.461 --> 08:25.364
now, I modified that for three feet. We just 
used... Two feet here. So when I got to teaching,

08:29.737 --> 08:33.101
and I dreamed this up. You've heard of dreams? 
Well, I was thinking about it. I tried and tried and

08:38.327 --> 08:42.552
tried to figure out some way to put three feet 
together by the Pearson Square. And so one night,

08:44.314 --> 08:48.158
about 2.30 in the morning, that came to me. And I got 
up right then, because you may forget those things

08:49.199 --> 08:54.986
if you don't, and tried it out, and it worked like 
nobody's business. Now, here's some letters I got

08:55.006 --> 08:56.828
on it. Yeah, this fellow Bostad was the chairman of 
the Department of Aluminum at Wisconsin, and

08:57.972 --> 09:03.538
that's what he said about it.

09:08.062 --> 09:15.950
It looks to me as if your modification of the 
Pearson square and mixing feeds is an excellent

09:08.062 --> 09:15.950
device for quick and accurate mixing of more than 
two feeds. Yeah. I think of it so well that I am

09:16.731 --> 09:25.600
having copies made for you during closure to give 
to other members of our department to one or two of

09:25.765 --> 09:27.627
our graduate students. I trust you will publish 
this. Now, I thought that was pretty good for a

09:29.990 --> 09:34.976
fellow like Wisconsin. Now, that's another thing 
that came out of A&M College. And before I

09:38.220 --> 09:55.080
published on that, I wrote Cornell, and I asked the 
dairy department here if they use it in milk

09:38.220 --> 09:55.080
production, taking one fat production of one kind 
of milk to another. and change it to another fat

09:55.600 --> 09:57.623
content. But that's only two. So I wrote around to 
Derryman. I wrote to everybody I could think of

10:03.670 --> 10:07.074
that would probably be in that field. And nobody 
had ever done what we did, you see, on that. And then

10:11.059 --> 10:12.061
I published it. And that's what he wanted me to do 
there, you see. Because he didn't know anything

10:16.166 --> 10:17.608
about it either. Who was Pearson? Well, he was a 
mathematician way back. I think he's from

10:23.866 --> 10:29.493
England, Carl Pearson. He was the one who figured 
out this Pearson Square for two. You see,

10:34.760 --> 10:36.602
pharmacists can use that. They've got two 
solutions to mix and use Pearson Square. It's

10:43.211 --> 10:44.752
wonderful. So it's kind of a universally accepted 
formula for a mixture of two ingredients. But I

10:51.341 --> 10:53.063
wanted to mix three. How did you work it out? Well,

10:56.811 --> 11:18.933
we'd say,

10:56.811 --> 11:18.933
well I want a ration, but I want 10% alfalfa meal in 
my ration. That'd be the third feature. Then how do

11:20.795 --> 11:22.797
I use this formula for that? Well, you have a fat 
meal, it's 20% protein. So if you're going to mix

11:28.686 --> 11:35.894
up, we always do this on a 100-pound basis because 
then you can go from 100 to a ton or anything. Well,

11:35.914 --> 11:41.120
if you're going to use 10% or 10 pounds, that leaves 
90 pounds of these two feeds. So since you're going

11:43.764 --> 11:50.031
to work with 90 pounds, then you can't use this 
because this is based on 10 pounds. So you get 9% of

11:50.431 --> 11:53.475
that, then you put 9 there, see? And 9% of this fits 
4. And then, 10 pounds of 25, that's 2 pounds of

11:56.973 --> 12:02.481
protein there. And 2 pounds from this leaves 13, 
you put in there, see. Alright, then you go to track

12:07.288 --> 12:09.752
it again. That's 41. And this is 4. That's 45. You 
want 90. Which is twice this. Come in there. So

12:20.408 --> 12:22.551
times 2 equals 82. Times 2 equals 8. That gives you 
90. Now, we've got 82 grain times 10% protein. Go

12:31.513 --> 12:32.794
back to this. That gives you 8.2. You've got 10 
pounds of alfalfa times 20% protein. That's 2.

12:42.803 --> 12:48.148
You've got 8 pounds of tankage times 6% protein. 
That's 4.8. Now this is a hundred and ten, five,

12:52.315 --> 13:00.582
seven, fifteen. Yeah, and that's what this fellow 
here liked. He said, it is, it's really good. If I

13:06.287 --> 13:11.431
got a fellow named Knox in there from Mexico, read 
what he said about it. I'm ready to thank you for

13:11.451 --> 13:16.896
sending us a copy of A Modification of the Parsons 
Square and Making Fees. I've shown it to the

13:17.596 --> 13:22.120
professors, to Professors Neal and Watkins, and 
they've made copies for them. We all agree that it

13:22.741 --> 13:31.033
is an ingenious use of the method and should be 
quite helpful in calculating formula where

13:22.741 --> 13:31.033
definite percentages are required. See, you can 
use it for four or five fees either. All you have to

13:34.198 --> 13:37.983
do is subtract that from the other. Now, why didn't 
somebody do that before I come along? Heck, you

13:40.467 --> 13:42.610
know, I'm not very smart. But I stumbled on that, 
but I dreamed it. I'd been thinking about it so

13:46.776 --> 13:51.102
hard, you know, trying to help these boys. And... I 
was amazed that I couldn't find anybody that had

13:52.525 --> 13:56.771
ever done that before. Well, I would have thought, 
like you, that perhaps some of the feed companies

13:57.672 --> 14:04.703
would have put somebody on to that earlier. Yes. I 
was surprised at that, too. Now, there's one feed

14:09.129 --> 14:11.633
company man in there named Sotolo. He used to be 
with Armoring Company. Is that Satola? Yeah,

14:18.173 --> 14:19.174
that's Satola. Read his letter now. He went away 
into...

14:20.576 --> 14:30.187
Would those letters be more valuable to the 
archives than they would to me? I don't need them.

14:31.568 --> 14:34.031
Of course, a fellow can make copies of them. Well, I 
think they would be very nice to have in the

14:34.531 --> 14:39.097
archives.

14:43.682 --> 14:44.723
We'd be pleased to have them.

14:48.652 --> 14:53.839
Maybe I ought to make copies of them and then send 
them to you. Okay. Another question that comes to

14:54.600 --> 14:59.727
mind I'd like to ask you. With all of the research 
and so forth that you have done in swine, how much

14:59.747 --> 15:08.899
were you involved in the evolution of the swine 
short course? Well,

15:10.821 --> 15:17.410
of course, the swine short course... had us 
beginning from the Texas Swine Breeders

15:18.335 --> 15:26.487
Association in connection with the head of the 
department. And they thought it'd be a good idea to

15:27.729 --> 15:31.414
have a swine short course. And I think that later 
developed, whereas they have some of these

15:32.817 --> 15:38.966
courses out in the state. I know the Texas Swine 
Breeders Association, they don't call it that

15:39.106 --> 15:43.953
anymore. I think they call it Texas Pork Producers 
Association.

15:49.132 --> 15:54.859
Porkus, P-O-R-C-U-S is a Latin word meaning pig. 
But I don't know why they changed it from Texas

15:56.521 --> 16:01.706
Swine Breeders to Texas Pork Producers. I guess 
they thought pork was a little nicer name than

16:01.727 --> 16:08.955
swine.

16:10.937 --> 16:16.944
But the Texas Swine Breeders Association was 
organized in 1890, and they used to have two

16:10.937 --> 16:16.944
meetings a year. They called them... for both of 
them were so-called educational meeting like

16:18.848 --> 16:24.215
short course. But they had one out in the state and 
one here. That made it nice. Sometimes they'd have

16:27.840 --> 16:32.686
one at Plainview, sometimes they'd have one at San 
Antonio, and the other one always here. And it made

16:34.469 --> 16:37.432
it real nice for the swine breeders. When they had 
it out in the state, they could visit farms, hog

16:39.415 --> 16:46.965
farms and stuff like that, and they could also have 
related

16:48.025 --> 17:04.004
industries like lumber yards, hardware stores, 
feed companies, and the press come to those

16:48.025 --> 17:04.004
meetings to see and they were all interested. So

17:04.044 --> 17:14.556
all I did, I didn't do anything, all I did is they put 
me on the program, I wrote a paper. Well, that was in

17:15.278 --> 17:26.991
itself a substantial contribution considering 
the amount of work you had already done in swine

17:15.278 --> 17:26.991
research. That's what I want to say, I guess. Well, 
swine is made up of five sections. Breeding,

17:34.519 --> 17:41.407
feeding, sanitation and disease, marketing, and 
general management. And your research can enter

17:45.147 --> 17:48.071
any one of those areas. And I always thought when a 
fellow asked me a question that I couldn't, didn't

17:49.112 --> 17:57.824
know the answer of or couldn't go to the literature 
and find the answer, that that's the problem. And

17:59.106 --> 18:02.710
that's how we get some of our problems to do all the 
research. If we can get the answer out of the

18:03.732 --> 18:07.797
literature, the course on that cotton seed meal, I 
could get the answer out of there, but it wasn't the

18:08.536 --> 18:11.119
right answer, you see. Or it wasn't a satisfactory 
answer. Well, after I'd gone through the

18:13.302 --> 18:28.322
literature and found out that they made those 
statements on 30% coccineal ration, somehow I

18:13.302 --> 18:28.322
know that hit me that that shouldn't be that way or 
something and got me to thinking a little bit on it.

18:29.424 --> 18:36.433
And another thing we did that I think is quite vital 
to research is... I hadn't been here too long,

18:36.785 --> 18:49.881
about four years, until I quit putting, usually 
when they try out a ration, they put ten pigs in this

18:36.785 --> 18:49.881
lot and ten pigs in that lot and so on, and feed them 
as a group. Well, I finally decided after four or

18:49.901 --> 18:57.190
five years that you didn't know how much feed each 
pig was eating. So I talked to the director and gave

18:58.412 --> 19:03.177
us enough money to build some individual feeding 
pens. We built 80 individual feeding pens out of

19:03.197 --> 19:05.340
100. at the old station. And we fed our pigs 
individually. You take on this gospel, if you

19:12.297 --> 19:19.528
don't feed them individually, you don't know how 
much gospel killed a pig or you didn't know how much

19:12.297 --> 19:19.528
feed he ate. And that, I think, is one of our 
contributions to research. And we did another

19:26.379 --> 19:27.601
thing. When I came here, the

19:28.322 --> 19:34.011
government put out a bulletin on how to conduct 
research with animals. And they had you to weigh

19:39.380 --> 19:45.668
them three days at the beginning and three days at 
the end of your test to get the initial weight and

19:39.380 --> 19:45.668
final weight. Well I did that for about from 25 to 30 
some odd and decided I wasn't getting anywhere

19:46.349 --> 19:52.397
there. It looks to me like one weight was just as 
good because three weights That second weight,

19:59.405 --> 20:02.148
you've already handled the pig some. He may have 
interfered with his gain or something. Third

20:04.250 --> 20:06.071
weight, he interfered with his gain. And it wasn't 
a true weight. And they said to take the second

20:08.914 --> 20:14.499
weight, the middle weight, to start your test on. 
Well, then the next day, if a pig had been getting

20:15.220 --> 20:20.585
corn, you put him on oats, and he wasn't used to 
eating oats. He's not going to eat what he should.

20:23.248 --> 20:24.208
He's not going to gain so much. So I just decided 
we'd get a test going. to see if it paid to weigh

20:27.383 --> 20:31.767
three days or over one day. And we published that, 
too. And I don't know whether you got a copy of that

20:34.110 --> 20:37.313
or not. One-day weight against three-day 
weights, we published that in the American

20:39.535 --> 20:44.460
Sidewound Production. And then that was 10 years 
later. We published in 1936. In 1946,

20:48.324 --> 20:54.690
a guy up at Illinois decided try to verify our work 
or disprove it or something. And he came to the same

20:58.214 --> 21:00.079
conclusions. That one day wait would give you just 
as good a reliable data as three days. Well, that

21:06.312 --> 21:08.397
saved a lot of work. Yeah. With that, together with 
individual feeding, I think it sure helps us out on

21:09.720 --> 21:15.092
research. I would imagine that the amount of work 
that you and other people working with you did must

21:15.477 --> 21:28.930
have done, had a substantial effect on the economy 
of Texas. There's a pretty good amount of pork

21:28.970 --> 21:34.055
production in Texas, I would think. Well, there 
was at that time. You know, when I came here, we had

21:35.477 --> 21:40.382
500,000 farms in Texas. Now they tell me they have 
about 180,000. Less farms. Well uh those 500,000

21:45.498 --> 21:57.795
farms each one of them on the average killed about 
two pigs a year so there's the million pigs that

21:45.498 --> 21:57.795
they killed every year just for farm use. Well with 
180,000 farms that that's a substantial decrease

21:58.717 --> 22:13.918
but uh yeah of course the old pig he got the name 
mortgage lifter you know because he supposed to

22:14.337 --> 22:17.923
pay for a lot of mortgage forms. That's what they 
call it, mortgage lifting. I hadn't heard that

22:19.605 --> 22:20.366
before. Corn belt, yeah. Yeah, he's known as the 
mortgage lifter.

22:27.658 --> 22:38.695
But if you can reduce the cost of the rations by 
proper use of cotton seed meal, you have improved

22:27.658 --> 22:38.695
the profit margin. And by... use of and also you of 
course not only you reduced the cost of the rations

22:40.493 --> 23:07.260
but you increase the quantity of them that reach 
maturity and also the same thing by introduction

22:40.493 --> 23:07.260
of vitamin A you improve the survival rate or 
decrease the anytime you can help a product that's

22:40.493 --> 23:07.260
produced on the farm uh It's market value, and 
you're helping a lot of other industries, too,

23:07.865 --> 23:11.969
that pay taxes. Processors, truckers.

23:18.376 --> 23:23.781
You mentioned that you had these individual pins 
out on the old station. Where was... F&B Station up

23:24.202 --> 23:26.784
here. I don't know whether you ever heard of it or 
not. No, F&B Station Road, yeah. Well, it's just

23:31.189 --> 23:32.450
right beyond that. There's still one long 
building up there. It's left, they've torn down

23:35.573 --> 23:37.356
most of them. There used to be a silo, they've torn 
it down. When did they discontinue the so-called

23:39.739 --> 23:44.386
College Station, Experiment Station? Well,

23:45.808 --> 23:52.737
I think they still have some. They still have some? 
Yeah, I think they still have some. I was

23:56.463 --> 23:57.865
uncertain. We have a lot of the Experiment Station 
records over in the archives, research project

23:57.905 --> 24:05.175
files. and annual reports of the various 
individual stations. Most of the college

24:08.632 --> 24:15.822
stations, what you call college stations, of 
course down there, that farm down there at the

24:08.632 --> 24:15.822
river, can end up here. There used to be quite a bit 
of work on, most of it was agronomy. You know,

24:24.434 --> 24:32.125
fertilizer testing and variety of crops and stuff 
like that. I think they've cut out a lot of that and

24:32.830 --> 24:40.439
taken it down yonder.

24:40.459 --> 24:53.454
We have the annual reports of the various stations 
and so on and so forth, and somehow I've got an

24:40.459 --> 24:53.454
impression that the station itself in College 
Station has been discontinued, but not entirely.

24:53.494 --> 24:55.376
Yeah, I think that's about right. They probably 
shifted it around down there. I think they called

24:59.982 --> 25:05.529
this, I forget what station, they called it FB 
station number 10, I think. Yeah, they made a lot of

25:06.290 --> 25:12.037
changes in that regard. They hadn't, the research 
is still going on, but it's just different places.

25:18.605 --> 25:28.858
I believe we talked a little bit ago about that you 
retired then from teaching and researching in 65.

25:29.210 --> 25:31.073
But you tell me you still have an office here. Are 
you still continuing to do some research? Well,

25:35.178 --> 25:44.611
when they made me that, uh, Dr. Butler, head of this 
department, said I was still a member of the

25:35.178 --> 25:44.611
Attaway staff. And actually in 1970, they asked me 
to take a course, to teach courses. They were short

25:49.959 --> 25:52.562
a faculty member here. And I taught feed and 
feeding over there in 1970 for one term. But, uh, I

26:00.209 --> 26:05.096
understand the way the thing is set up. If you're 
Professor Emeritus, that they will furnish you a

26:05.237 --> 26:17.555
space to come and read your journals and take care 
of your business. Yeah, that's the way I

26:17.575 --> 26:19.638
understand it too. And they gave me a phone and they 
were really nice to me. I wasn't expecting that. So

26:26.011 --> 26:31.639
you're not involved in any individual research 
projects or anything of that nature anymore. No.

26:32.139 --> 26:36.005
But you do have an office to which you can come. 
That's really nice. I presume you have some

26:36.545 --> 26:38.548
secretarial assistance. Yes, she'll write a 
letter for me.

26:43.755 --> 26:50.905
We talked a little bit earlier and looked briefly 
at an article in which you were made an honorary

26:43.755 --> 26:50.905
fellow of the American Society of Animal Science. 
I believe in 1965, at the Swine and Shark Course,

26:51.290 --> 26:56.556
you were awarded the Royal Order of the Silk and 
Purse. Yes. I've forgotten about that. What was

26:59.460 --> 27:00.020
that? That was in 1965. 1965. Is that one of those 
mentioned in that? No, I don't guess it was. I've

27:07.710 --> 27:10.153
seen that bulletin with my name on the front of it. 
Let's see. I have an article here from the Eagle in

27:14.898 --> 27:17.662
1965. Oh, does that tell about that? That tells 
about that. Oh, yeah. You got that? Did you get

27:21.833 --> 27:24.377
other awards? Well, what's that up there? I got 
that award, that map up yonder. Uh-huh. And then,

27:32.010 --> 27:33.372
of course, these people. That's from the Texas 
Swine and the Swine Breeders Association. Up

27:36.597 --> 27:37.519
yonder, yeah. 65, yeah. And then these people made 
a sketch of me one time, put it in their magazine,

27:38.080 --> 27:47.655
Mold Breeders Who's Who. Mm-hmm. But, yeah.

27:51.922 --> 28:17.227
I

27:51.922 --> 28:17.227
was

27:51.922 --> 28:17.227
invited to judge the swine at the International 
one

27:51.922 --> 28:17.227
time. I thought this was quite an honor.

28:25.402 --> 28:45.425
So

28:25.402 --> 28:45.425
what you did, what your responsibility there was, 
you judged the animals first and then the teams

28:25.402 --> 28:45.425
who... No, this wasn't, this doesn't have 
anything to do with the team. Uh-huh. See, this is

28:45.826 --> 28:47.227
judging the livestock. Livestock that were there 
for show. Yeah. Uh-huh. And, uh... That'll be 152.

29:00.306 --> 29:04.911
See, this livestock, they invite different 
judges to judge it, you see. And I was judging the

29:06.453 --> 29:12.400
Duroc Barrels. Duroc Barrels, and this was in 
Chicago. Uh-huh. International. Uh-huh. Was

29:18.087 --> 29:19.809
this, let's see, there's a clip in here. It says 
1939. That was it. Well, but that was 1938. The show

29:25.566 --> 29:28.429
was in 38.

29:31.552 --> 29:37.658
So that was, I would imagine, it would be quite an 
honor to be invited. Yes, up to that time. I don't

29:39.020 --> 29:39.921
know what's happened since. They hadn't come down 
to this far to get a judge in Texas. They'd stayed up

29:46.267 --> 29:48.970
yonners most of the places.

29:52.966 --> 30:03.051
When the student stock judging teams go to the 
International Livestock Exposition and judge,

29:52.966 --> 30:03.051
what what livestock do they judge? They judge

30:09.031 --> 30:16.080
It's like any judging contest where they have 
cattle, sheep, hogs, and horses. Did they judge

30:16.361 --> 30:20.366
the stock that is entered in the show? No, they 
don't judge that same stock. The show will go

30:24.331 --> 30:38.329
around, and maybe you're an exhibitor there, and 
if you've got an animal that you don't mind them

30:24.331 --> 30:38.329
working on, you'll say, well, you can take my 
animal, and they'll get them all together like

30:24.331 --> 30:38.329
that. There's usually four animals in a class.
