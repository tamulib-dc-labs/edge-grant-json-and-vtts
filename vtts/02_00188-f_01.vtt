WEBVTT

00:05.768 --> 00:08.912
Other good teachers? M.H. Byron.

00:12.996 --> 00:13.757
What did he teach?

00:16.520 --> 00:24.510
He was a research man for the Deadhead. He was the 
one that took over the cotton stripper. He, he,

00:35.603 --> 00:38.788
that was his job for years. And he taught me a lot of 
stuff. How to, we tore batteries down and repaired

00:44.817 --> 00:55.694
them and put them back together and

00:44.817 --> 00:55.694
car batteries. And charged them up and they had a 
whole system there and they kind of, he taught me to

00:56.536 --> 01:02.505
use a torch. Did your dad deliberately teach you 
much? He was a hard test master. But did he

01:10.722 --> 01:12.425
instruct? Yes, he did. Is that right? He did. Now, 
you didn't have any classes taught by him, did you?

01:17.531 --> 01:17.812
Yes. You did? What was it? It was farm instruction. 
And what grade did you make? Do you remember?

01:26.864 --> 01:27.204
Eight. I designed the building on... You know 
these Quonset humps that they had? When Dad said,

01:38.287 --> 01:42.932
he said, I want you to design one. See, Dad went down 
there on the river during the Depression, and he

01:43.273 --> 01:51.323
bought 150 acres for $10 an acre.

01:54.967 --> 01:58.972
That same land today, you can't buy it for less than 
50 grand. Yeah, yeah. So he said, we'll decide a

02:00.316 --> 02:08.227
building down there. So he gave me, that was my 
project when I was a senior. And I designed the

02:13.794 --> 02:16.198
thing.

02:19.262 --> 02:28.855
And Dad always wore a suit,

02:19.262 --> 02:28.855
the vest, and he had a and a pocket watch on this 
side, and some sort of a little thing over here.

02:37.332 --> 02:40.377
That might have been a Masonic, a Masonic thing. It 
was either a Masonic or a S-A-H-E, you know, Aggie

02:42.460 --> 02:51.995
Dream Association. But I think it might have been a 
Masonic. I found out here just recently. And so he

02:59.564 --> 03:01.946
had a chain across there. Well, he told me to build a 
building like those closets with

03:04.288 --> 03:16.779
a, in a catenary.

03:21.423 --> 03:23.185
You don't know what a catenary is, do you? Catener? 
Catenary. No, sir. Catenary. Well, those wires on

03:29.197 --> 03:33.123
a suspension. Oh, I see. Okay. That's a catenary. 
Okay. It's always in tension. If you turn it upside

03:40.615 --> 03:44.260
down, it'll always be in compression. You got no 
other? So we designed it.

03:53.395 --> 03:55.558
So the reason for asking for that, He came in there 
and we were drawing, we drew it up. We had to draw

04:01.479 --> 04:03.061
this thing in there. Big curve at the top. Yeah, big 
curve. So I said, I just walked up there one day, I

04:08.048 --> 04:13.195
said, can I have your watch and chain?

04:16.139 --> 04:21.546
We went over there and hung it on the wall. And I got 
someone to help me, and we drew that thing exactly

04:21.796 --> 04:27.363
the width that we wanted it. That's the way we got 
the catnip. That's the catnip. And that was to

04:31.108 --> 04:35.514
support those upright curve, those arches? Yeah. 
So then he says, now, you go take that over and have

04:37.116 --> 04:48.310
a, he had a lot of rapport with those people in the 
San Ling Ling. And he said, go take it. I think he

04:51.508 --> 04:55.953
said, I don't remember. I know what a man looked 
like. He was a big guy. And I told him what I wanted.

05:02.982 --> 05:06.145
And he said, yeah, set it down there, and I'll look 
at it. And he went through some calculations on it

05:08.608 --> 05:11.972
later. And he said, come back in a couple of days, 
and I'll have it for you. He went through some

05:16.775 --> 05:24.102
calculations on them, and then he told me that that 
thing wouldn't stand up and wouldn't win. He told

05:24.983 --> 05:28.006
me how to fix it. So here's your catenary like this. 
He said, put a floor across here. It was a two-story

05:33.611 --> 05:35.053
building. It wasn't big enough for a two-story. He 
said, put a floor across here and put some

05:36.814 --> 05:43.561
suspensions right here from that roof down here to 
hold that floor. He said, he'll see it. It's strong

05:45.597 --> 05:48.826
enough now. Because you made use of both sides of 
that. You transferred it over. Now, in all of your

05:55.906 --> 06:00.720
A&M undergraduate years, you never... uh, 
wavered about being an engineer. That was your

06:04.427 --> 06:05.650
plan all the time. That's correct. All right. And, 
uh... See, I was raised in a, in a, in a collegiate

06:09.657 --> 06:12.321
family. Sure. Sure. And, uh, did your dad 
encourage that goal for you? Oh, yes. Okay. Now,

06:20.055 --> 06:26.286
when you graduated, how well prepared did you 
think A&M had made you as an engineer? You felt

06:26.975 --> 06:28.918
comfortable. When you got to Iowa State for your 
graduate work, did you find that you were,

06:29.398 --> 06:37.270
compared to other graduate students, were you 
well? We were well prepared. Now they were tough.

06:42.778 --> 06:47.665
They were tougher than we'd been used to. Because 
old Van Giese, he was a German. And he taught that

06:54.802 --> 06:58.228
same course. And then I went out. And so we got in the 
meeting. The

07:07.483 --> 07:20.404
last thing they do for you is they get all your 
teachers in there into a session with you. And I had

07:21.768 --> 07:26.333
built a building out there that had a 40-foot span 
on it. And

07:27.894 --> 07:39.365
so I had done some, I had taken a course in steel 
construction. That's one that I had to take. And

07:42.468 --> 07:48.635
this prof, he said, did you treat that thing? I had 
some braces on it. did you create that thing as a

07:51.738 --> 07:57.745
plate girder or did you depend on those trusses? 
And I said, I

07:59.207 --> 08:05.615
really depend on those trusses in there. But he 
said, do you? And I said, you're right, it could

08:08.338 --> 08:12.964
have been a full plate girder. And so I remember 
that thing. Now, you finished at Iowa State and

08:17.894 --> 08:22.118
then came back to A&M? Yeah, that was in 38. 38. And 
you joined the faculty then? No, worked for my

08:26.843 --> 08:29.625
father. Worked for your father. For a year. For a 
year. And was he, he died the next year? Yes.

08:39.915 --> 08:44.880
It was that, the fall of that year in 38. He was in 
Dallas one day and he was walking down the street

08:45.890 --> 08:58.286
and his hand just opened and dropped his suitcase. 
Heart attack? No. And that's what we didn't know

09:02.391 --> 09:05.155
about. So it got worse.

09:11.563 --> 09:14.547
And that was it, yeah. It'd be in the fall of 38.

09:19.632 --> 09:27.800
So then

09:19.632 --> 09:27.800
my wife, he wanted to go. He said, take me to Mayo 
Clinic. To Mayo Clinic? And so I did. We did. We got

09:38.571 --> 09:39.552
on training. We went through.

09:45.425 --> 09:52.153
St. Louis, and that train was running a hundred 
miles an hour. And that thing went across from

09:52.173 --> 09:55.216
there. I said

09:55.376 --> 10:08.431
over there in time, I know what that thing was 
doing, but it was clicking and that rail was too

09:55.376 --> 10:08.431
fast. And so they got him up there and They looked at 
him and they really didn't know what was going on

10:11.935 --> 10:17.925
with him. They did not know. There was no way they 
could tell. He had some impairment with his

10:23.675 --> 10:31.167
hand. And so we were... So then what happened was 
that the

10:38.311 --> 11:00.690
hardware and implement association, they always 
put on a big deal convention in Houston in the late

10:38.311 --> 11:00.690
January. And it was getting close to that. It was 
cold, the blue blades were thick. And so then I

11:09.395 --> 11:27.352
decided that, no, he decided to call Mother and 
have her come up here and stay with me, and you got to

11:09.395 --> 11:27.352
go run that convention.

11:31.336 --> 11:32.157
Yeah, I was. I bet I did.

11:38.386 --> 11:51.163
We got the mother up there, and just before that 
happened, well, he lost the sense in the side of his

11:38.386 --> 11:51.163
face.

11:52.364 --> 11:54.047
See, they didn't know where it was. They didn't 
know whether it was in a muscle or in the spine or

11:54.207 --> 12:00.755
someplace else. But when he lost the sensation in 
his face, they knew it was in his head. Mm-hmm. And

12:06.635 --> 12:11.881
so she stayed with him and finally brought him 
home. And that was in, he died in November of that

12:13.723 --> 12:20.150
year. Of 39. Yeah, and mother took care of him. And 
built a bed down in the sun porch, and she had help,

12:23.834 --> 12:31.743
took care of him. All right, on a happier note, when 
did you meet your wife? about right then, about

12:36.031 --> 12:37.732
that. It was a little before that. It was in, when I 
got back in 30, yeah, 38. When you got back from Iowa

12:46.440 --> 12:47.821
State? Yeah, I got back in September. And we had 
started to build that, we had started, Dan and I had

12:52.545 --> 13:00.832
started to write that handbook for hang 
engineers. And so then,

13:09.038 --> 13:12.422
It had a dance over there. So I wanted to go to the 
dance. So I asked

13:15.385 --> 13:21.332
Madge Wallace. I don't know if you ever knew her or 
not. It's Wallace, Wallace Printing Company, but

13:23.375 --> 13:31.764
she was a, her name just, she married a Wallace. Her 
name was Madge Nettles. She had worked with Dan

13:34.688 --> 13:37.611
when he was in the, the resettlement 
administration. See, Dad spent several years

13:39.978 --> 13:45.245
right in there while I was at Ames. He ran the 
resettlement administration for the government

13:46.567 --> 13:52.316
here. And that was one of the times. And so then I 
asked Madge, can you find me a date? And so she went

14:06.025 --> 14:11.233
and got her roommate, which was Margaret. And her 
roommate where? In a

14:13.236 --> 14:25.935
rooming house right across from the Catholic 
school there in Bride. Oh, okay. And what was this

14:26.796 --> 14:29.760
roommate doing? Was she working? She was a 
teacher. Oh, okay. In Bryan High School. And where

14:36.270 --> 14:37.492
had she grown up? In Hubbard, Texas. Hubbard, 
Texas. Gone to college where? In Baylor. Baylor,

14:45.324 --> 14:46.485
okay. She finished high school a year ahead of 
time. She finished Baylor in three years. And so

14:53.984 --> 14:58.208
you go out with this Baptist girl to the dance. No, 
she wasn't a Baptist. Oh, I thought if she went to

14:59.670 --> 15:02.533
Baylor, she might have been. No, she went there. 
She went there, and they gave her a job. She ran a

15:10.221 --> 15:11.482
switchboard.

15:14.145 --> 15:19.030
That was her job, and that was primarily due to this 
woman. The roommate she had, which was married

15:19.887 --> 15:37.537
with the principal of the school down here, and 
that's how she got, she first taught at, Margaret

15:19.887 --> 15:37.537
first taught two years at Adaska, and then she came 
down here. Her roommate, told her husband, and the

15:42.382 --> 15:54.956
mortgage was available up there, and so they 
bumped into each other one day, and he said, come on

15:42.382 --> 15:54.956
down here.

15:57.739 --> 16:09.132
So she went to work down there, and so this was in the 
fall, and we got together a little over about the

15:57.739 --> 16:09.132
middle of the year, Then I had to go to take care of 
this convention down here. And then later we

16:16.368 --> 16:20.133
decided to get married. So y'all got married when? 
January 11, 1939. 39. And left immediately for the

16:27.963 --> 16:35.812
ASA convention in Minneapolis. We drove a car. And 
then we went from there to Washington, D.C., which

16:38.491 --> 16:45.380
I thought would work for the I.R.E.M. Now, after 
that, did you ever work for A.N.M. again? No, no.

16:54.392 --> 16:56.495
Yes, I did after World War II. What did you do?

17:00.160 --> 17:08.110
Mother, I was

17:00.160 --> 17:08.110
discharged from Thailand.

17:09.727 --> 17:10.468
came home. Of course we had, by that time, we had 
even a child, because the oldest girl was born in

17:11.549 --> 17:25.984
Chicago during World War II. And Margaret worked 
in the

17:27.645 --> 17:38.316
personnel department for the University of 
Chicago. And

17:39.207 --> 17:56.687
so we came home and we were just sitting around down 
there and the REA wanted to send me to the state of

17:39.207 --> 17:56.687
Washington and I said I didn't want to go. And so I 
just never did answer their questions. And so

18:08.705 --> 18:23.984
uh, the director of the Inuring Experiment 
Station, a good friend of ours, a good friend of

18:08.705 --> 18:23.984
Mother's too, and she, he called Mother up and 
says, has Bill come home yet? Yeah, he's been here

18:26.547 --> 18:27.788
about a week. Send him up here. Now who was that? Oh. 
Remember his name? Yeah.

18:40.396 --> 18:41.658
You'll think of it in a minute. Go ahead. Yeah. 
Anyways, we just walked in up there. And he said, I

18:46.645 --> 18:54.476
got to have somebody to administrative 
assistant.

18:54.496 --> 18:58.402
So I got hired right then. They just made out the 
papers and hired me. And so then I did a lot of, for

19:01.707 --> 19:10.099
them, I did a bunch of different things. It was just 
an administrative job. I was just taking care for

19:15.259 --> 19:21.507
the vice director. I think he was the vice 
director. Describe this campus right after the

19:23.269 --> 19:29.557
war was over as the veterans start pouring in here. 
What was it like? Oh, they converted Walden Hall to

19:31.700 --> 19:36.165
some apartments. And then the women came in there 
pregnant. How

19:40.201 --> 20:09.685
long

19:40.201 --> 20:09.685
did it take to get the temporary buildings near 
Kyle Field and the old, near the old,

19:40.201 --> 20:09.685
oh what, where the poor boys lived during the 
Depression? How long did it take them to move those

20:10.002 --> 20:13.667
in? Did they do that quickly? They were already 
there. They were there way back. Didn't they put in

20:22.558 --> 20:25.622
some new temporary structures down there also? 
They were mostly houses that were on the on the

20:31.130 --> 20:33.452
street there on Bush Avenue. Okay. To the, to the, 
to between there and the Wellborn, you know.

20:38.578 --> 20:38.718
Mm-hmm. There's a whole bunch right in there. 
Yeah, yeah. And they were saying some constructed

20:40.920 --> 20:55.095
elsewhere, and then a large home would be taken 
over, and they would, they would, the county

20:40.920 --> 20:55.095
would, would get together. Mm-hmm. And they 
would, they would kind of have an association of

20:58.788 --> 21:11.384
some sort that, and they were supplying money, and 
more than that, goods, whatever, and food. But

21:11.945 --> 21:19.816
then after World War II, Usually one of the, there 
was a mother came with them. After World War II,

21:19.836 --> 21:23.260
weren't there a whole bunch of Quick, new, 
temporary buildings for the veterans to live in?

21:30.529 --> 21:32.411
Vet village type of things? Yeah, they moved those 
up. They moved them up there on

21:35.735 --> 21:48.292
the old Aging Farms where it was. Okay. All those 
things up there were constructions. They were,

21:53.446 --> 21:58.894
now they're permanent buildings, but they moved 
in. Now called College View. Yeah, College View.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.561
But they were temporary. Where did those 
buildings come from? Did they come from the Air

22:05.524 --> 22:07.247
Force Base? Bryan Field? I don't think they did. 
There wasn't enough out there.

22:18.685 --> 22:20.888
See, Bryan Field was a, was a

22:21.560 --> 22:33.733
training base for instrument flying.

22:36.536 --> 22:43.344
And they had taken over the college, the 
Easterwood here. See, Easterwood was built

22:43.364 --> 22:48.850
under, by the FAA. So if a military wanted it, 
they'd just give them a dollar and they got control

22:49.403 --> 22:56.593
of it. That's what happened. And they used it 
principally for training students to land and

22:59.497 --> 23:13.096
take off under instrument conditions. And so 
that's what that was for. Now the vet, but the

23:18.547 --> 23:22.599
veteran students changed this community, didn't 
they? They did, they did. Friends were, and they,

23:25.789 --> 23:31.847
they, they put in a, a, right in Speesa Hall in the, 
They put in another eating joint down there from

23:32.182 --> 23:38.790
the side. You went in that side door. And that's 
where the people from Walden Hall ate. You had to

23:48.481 --> 23:49.622
eat over there. And were those veterans good 
students? Wonderful students. That's what I've

23:54.848 --> 23:55.950
always heard. That's what I've always heard. All 
right, you worked for then the college. How long?

24:02.749 --> 24:04.671
14 years, up to 1960. Okay, and were you with the Ag 
Extension Experiment Station all those years?

24:12.920 --> 24:20.729
What happened was that at first I was an 
administrative assistant. I had, I had a whole

24:20.750 --> 24:26.456
five or six stenographers. They brought me 
engineering bulletins that were in manuscript

24:30.788 --> 24:36.176
form. And I had all these people there. Then I'd 
take them, had to take them over to Austin to a Bible

24:40.222 --> 24:54.662
printer who had estate contracts at the 
publisher. They got through. Now that was one of

24:56.184 --> 24:58.988
the jobs I had. Then I had other Everything came up 
with a job of some sort. So then you had an estate

25:06.813 --> 25:17.004
required that you couldn't have an escalation 
cross in anything you bought. I mean, you had to

25:19.346 --> 25:21.688
price. So they wanted a motor for the wind tunnel. 
Where are we going to get a motor for the wind

25:30.745 --> 25:34.930
tunnel? Well, we scurried around and asked a lot of 
questions, and finally found out that there was a

25:34.950 --> 25:54.374
rewind company, and we wanted 2,000 horsepower

25:34.950 --> 25:54.374
engines. And he came back at us and said, Well, he 
could get us one, and it

26:00.833 --> 26:24.883
turned out what it was was a big generator, a 2,000 
horsepower generator that was hooked to those big

26:00.833 --> 26:24.883
engines on the 29s for test work in a plant in 
Chicago, Illinois. that's where those engines

26:26.213 --> 26:55.680
were tested and they were run six hours on that and 
torn down and then they were put back together and

26:26.213 --> 26:55.680
rerun well he bought one this guy was rewind man 
bought one of those things rewinded into a motor

26:26.213 --> 26:55.680
and gave us a price and we bought it and we shipped 
down here and

26:57.398 --> 27:03.886
old Frank Brown, old Frank Brown is his name, he was 
the college electrician. That thing had a

27:05.288 --> 27:11.255
starting circuit on it was 2300 volts. And that's 
all it had, that's the only piece of line they had

27:11.275 --> 27:16.842
going out there. And they could only run it at night 
because we didn't have enough fire to pull them.

27:22.778 --> 27:26.702
Which is common in most, uh, uh, wind tunnels. 
Mm-hmm. They, they absorb so much of our, you know,

27:26.883 --> 27:31.127
even their own air. The one that, I know the one up 
there in the right field that we run at night,

27:32.829 --> 27:42.039
40,000 horsepower. Now, during these years, 
where was Ag Experiment State, uh, where were

27:42.059 --> 27:48.246
y'all located? Well, we, in 1935, we, uh, 34, we got 
in the Aggie Union Building. All right, and was

27:55.833 --> 27:57.536
this all the time? Huh? No, I'm sorry, I didn't mean 
Aggie Union. No, you were working for the

28:00.542 --> 28:03.327
Experiment Station or the Extensions? Yeah, 
uh-huh. Where was the Experiment Station

28:03.888 --> 28:06.734
located? Uh, in the, uh... geology building. Now 
this is after World War II. Yeah, it had a little top

28:16.872 --> 28:19.995
on it. Who was the director when you went to work in 
45 or 46? What the heck, the old doctor, he was a

28:25.642 --> 28:38.517
nice, oh, and then later, oh yeah, what was his 
name, he came in there.

28:41.585 --> 28:45.088
That's the second one. All right, now y'all 
reported to the dean of agriculture? Dean of

28:50.753 --> 28:52.935
engineering. And who was the dean then?

28:57.740 --> 28:59.461
Benson. No, Benson wasn't dean yet. Was it 
Calhoun? Might have been. It didn't bother me. I

29:08.349 --> 29:11.592
was too damn busy. Did, how did you feel about? Oh, 
yeah, we had another one. We had Langford, not the

29:17.251 --> 29:32.027
one you know, but they had a man called Langford 
that he was working on

29:17.251 --> 29:32.027
freight race. That was in there. That was mixed up 
in there. So I had a, you know, I didn't like that.

29:39.989 --> 29:57.671
And across the street, across the, that was on the 
east side of the, in the fourth floor up there, and

29:39.989 --> 29:57.671
on the other side there was, was Dr. Lindsey, who 
was head of the, came from the Lindsey and Ingram

29:39.989 --> 29:57.671
department. And he had three boys,

29:57.691 --> 30:08.545
one of them a doctor, one of them would take care of 
your life, your eye case, and one of them a lawyer. I

30:08.930 --> 30:10.932
knew all three of them. I knew the old man too. Who 
was the A&M president when you got back?

30:20.965 --> 30:22.807
I don't know. Gilchrist? I guess Gilchrist was. 
Were you aware of that march the students made when

30:27.854 --> 30:35.443
the Corps marched on his house to try to revolt?

30:38.292 --> 30:48.481
He was trying to crack down on them to quit hazing 
the freshmen so long, and they tried to confront

30:38.292 --> 30:48.481
him. Where was he? He was in the college residence 
up there? He was living in the president's house,

30:53.625 --> 30:57.248
yes, sir, and they marched on that house one night. 
I don't know anything about that. During those

31:00.371 --> 31:08.097
years, in the late 40s and 50s, did you and your 
colleagues think A&M was making progress? Oh,

31:08.431 --> 31:11.174
yes.

31:11.774 --> 31:16.019
We knew for a fact that they were going to do two 
things. They were going to let the niggers in, and

31:17.080 --> 31:21.364
they were going to let the women in. I made a million 
old men mad, because I said, which do you want

31:21.384 --> 31:26.550
first? You want the nigger in there, or you want the 
nigger in there? You want the woman in there. And,

31:31.315 --> 31:33.477
of course, they preferred the woman.
