WEBVTT

00:03.288 --> 00:25.118
Now, another issue that I was thinking about was once you were successful in another country, I would think, and I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I would think there would be some jealousy from some of the nationals, maybe the government nationals, or maybe the scientific community in Mexico.

00:25.578 --> 00:26.059
Was there?

00:29.283 --> 00:32.788
There may have been with this one old senior scientist.

00:32.937 --> 00:33.538
at one point.

00:34.339 --> 00:39.106
And I think it was particularly so in some of the other crops.

00:39.948 --> 00:51.004
But I was working on wheat, which he started out on, and I used to see him quite frequently, and I think I circumvented a lot of this by stopping by to see him.

00:52.126 --> 00:55.632
But there's certain resentment there because of fear.

00:56.493 --> 01:01.240
Because if you see these kinds of changes taking place,

01:02.215 --> 01:16.853
The people I subsequently learned in other countries are bound to feel, hell, somebody's going to ask the question, why didn't you do it?

01:16.873 --> 01:19.376
So, you can understand us.

01:19.396 --> 01:26.886
About in 1956... And of course, he was there all alone.

01:26.906 --> 01:27.987
He couldn't do it.

01:30.025 --> 01:34.872
As far as the nationals, the young people who are trained, of course, they're part of the team.

01:34.892 --> 01:36.034
You don't get into that.

01:36.054 --> 01:36.895
No, no.

01:37.276 --> 01:38.577
And they're proud to be part of the team.

01:38.597 --> 01:39.218
Probably, yes.

01:39.739 --> 01:42.844
As a matter of fact, some of them— My prestige, I would imagine.

01:42.864 --> 01:47.170
And some of those also kind of irritate some of the old guard.

01:47.531 --> 01:47.811
Sure.

01:49.974 --> 01:52.518
You've got to watch— They're sort of a new wave of scientists, you know.

01:52.538 --> 01:55.442
You've got to watch that they don't overdo it.

01:57.700 --> 02:09.878
And I would imagine in a rather undeveloped setting, these young scientists would think anyway that they probably would hold a lot of prestige in the community.

02:09.898 --> 02:11.079
Of course.

02:11.099 --> 02:13.923
Sure.

02:13.944 --> 02:15.946
Did any of them ever get into politics?

02:17.449 --> 02:17.789
Yes.

02:19.211 --> 02:21.534
Some of them became secretaries of agriculture.

02:21.795 --> 02:21.955
Yeah.

02:23.117 --> 02:23.978
I would guess so.

02:25.730 --> 02:36.561
By 1956, I read that you were considering going down to Panama and helping them with a banana fungus.

02:37.181 --> 02:40.805
This was in Honduras, United Fruit Company.

02:40.825 --> 02:42.527
Oh, United Fruit Company.

02:42.547 --> 02:43.328
Tell me about this.

02:44.549 --> 02:46.371
I guess it was in 56 or 57.

02:46.951 --> 02:53.678
When I could see that the job that I was doing was finishing, I had a chance to.

02:54.215 --> 03:00.702
go to the United Fruit Company and work on Fusarium wilt.

03:04.386 --> 03:08.070
The banana plantations used to become infected with this wilt.

03:09.912 --> 03:12.155
And the result was there was no active control.

03:13.136 --> 03:20.744
You'd have to move out, abandon the whole plantation, develop new land, put in the irrigation, the whole damn thing.

03:20.764 --> 03:23.547
It was a very, very expensive operation.

03:24.404 --> 03:51.711
and so at that time they were considering starting a, they had a small breeding program for many years, testing different things, but they were going into looking for varietal resistance and for a time I was considering this and this was all at the same time when

03:54.475 --> 04:00.009
The job was turning down, I was turning it over to Narvaez, the Mexican Wheat Program.

04:00.790 --> 04:11.657
It was about the time when I was looking at the wheat problems in Latin America and then a year later or so.

04:12.430 --> 04:14.052
from Morocco to India.

04:14.232 --> 04:17.976
And when I suggested, well, why don't I have a look at soybeans?

04:18.617 --> 04:21.480
All of this was in the mill about the same time.

04:22.261 --> 04:26.806
So I decided not to go.

04:28.748 --> 04:42.083
When the foundation said, no, we're going to look at some of these other problems, because the crunch was on in the early 60s, you see, for food in the Indian subcontinent, like it is in Africa now.

04:42.485 --> 04:45.869
Okay, well let's go to 1960 then.

04:47.110 --> 04:53.036
Did you feel, for the most part by that time, that you had completed your mission?

04:54.278 --> 04:54.498
Yes.

04:54.678 --> 04:56.280
Were you itchy, ready to move on?

04:56.600 --> 04:57.922
As it was perceived, yeah.

04:58.682 --> 05:03.748
Now the mission, of course, had expanded tremendously, but did you think that you were ready to move on?

05:04.368 --> 05:12.357
Yeah, I didn't want to be just excess baggage, and I didn't want to sit there and get in the way of the young Mexican people that

05:12.674 --> 05:14.736
trained.

05:14.756 --> 05:18.779
And I didn't know what I was going to do.

05:18.799 --> 05:21.782
As I pointed out there, we were looking at quite a few things.

05:22.743 --> 05:29.028
Then when they sent me on this trip, 59, I went through Latin America.

05:29.048 --> 05:31.010
Right, for the Rockefeller Foundation.

05:31.030 --> 05:42.360
60, with Rockefeller and FAO, Food and Agriculture Organization, went across looking at wheat problems from Morocco to India.

05:42.712 --> 05:50.162
And I found everywhere, with the exception of two countries, shortage of trained people.

05:50.843 --> 05:58.914
The only two countries where there did not have this shortage of wheat scientists was India and Egypt.

06:00.015 --> 06:08.787
And in both of those countries, I saw them frittering away their time, well-trained scientists, working on things of secondary importance rather than getting at the

06:09.070 --> 06:10.892
crux of the problems.

06:10.912 --> 06:26.313
Very often they were continuing to do things that they'd done for their doctored thesis in some foreign country, rather than go out and take a look at the big broad picture of how to change production.

06:26.693 --> 06:31.239
I should have pointed out that all the way along, I think this is back, let me go back again.

06:31.379 --> 06:37.187
In Mexico, the real difference between wheat and corn

06:37.572 --> 06:43.379
was that we integrated across disciplines.

06:43.399 --> 06:45.961
I knew that there was no magic in the variety alone.

06:46.963 --> 06:59.997
I knew that unless you restored soil fertility, unless you planted that variety at the right time and the right way, handled the water, if it was irrigation water properly or conserved it if it was rain-fed, you weren't going anyplace.

07:00.117 --> 07:07.005
Same way on weeds and insects and diseases.

07:08.352 --> 07:17.060
I also got a pretty good insight working with the farmers co-ops on this whole pricing situation, both for fertilizer and for the grain.

07:18.421 --> 07:26.669
And so, through a stroke of bad luck, you have to patch and splice.

07:28.170 --> 07:36.958
The first eight years, we had one, two, four agronomist soil scientists.

07:37.613 --> 07:40.756
It so happened that the turnover was very great.

07:41.837 --> 08:03.818
But the first year when I was there, since I still didn't have the wheat program going very well, I mean, it wasn't full-time, I would work with fertilizer also with Dr. William Caldwell, who was the first soil scientist, putting in the fertilizer test on corn and wheat and taking the results.

08:03.838 --> 08:06.000
Then when he left, we continued

08:06.453 --> 08:07.294
as best we could.

08:07.874 --> 08:14.061
We got another soil scientist, and the same thing was repeated, and so we just kept doing this.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.042
Whereas in corn, they never did this.

08:16.863 --> 08:18.905
When they'd lose the agronomists, why, they'd quit.

08:18.985 --> 08:33.760
But we would take our wheat team and put tests out on farms as best we could, probably not nearly so effectively or efficiently as they should have been done, but nevertheless, we were gaining experience.

08:34.617 --> 08:36.340
This turned out to be the difference.

08:36.400 --> 08:44.852
I mean, we could look at the forest, not stand behind the one tree, varietal improvement, and the corn program never did.

08:45.413 --> 08:59.655
They, for some unknown reason, seemed to believe that if you got the magic variety, all of the other pieces would come together by itself, and it just doesn't.

08:59.675 --> 09:01.958
And I'd learned this long before we moved to...

09:02.410 --> 09:06.095
the Near East or to other South American countries.

09:06.115 --> 09:09.480
I learned it in Mexico.

09:09.521 --> 09:28.148
Just as an aside, it's really interesting to me about corn itself, because I did some interviews at Purdue University with agricultural experts out there and they talked about many of the same things that we talked about dealing with wheat, and I don't know what was going on in the

09:31.148 --> 09:36.386
And in those areas, corn production was increasing rapidly at this time.

09:36.626 --> 09:37.710
Even a little bit earlier.

09:38.132 --> 09:40.198
Faster than any other crop.

09:40.801 --> 09:43.048
But I think that the reason is that

09:43.282 --> 09:44.163
If you follow U.S.

09:44.423 --> 09:47.848
patterns, you get no place in the third world.

09:48.409 --> 09:59.823
Because the extension service functions, universities function, the agribusiness has got their own specialty services, the machinery companies, but you don't have any of these in third world countries.

10:00.805 --> 10:03.488
And if you rely on those, nothing happens.

10:04.550 --> 10:05.291
They don't exist.

10:05.551 --> 10:08.755
Okay, let's go to India.

10:09.216 --> 10:11.078
Why were you sent to India?

10:11.362 --> 10:19.733
Well, first, on this trip, I said that they were all short of trained people except two, India and Pakistan.

10:19.953 --> 10:28.104
And there they were fiddling around with a lot of mutation genetics that I thought was pretty worthless.

10:29.165 --> 10:31.769
And Egypt was pretty sophisticated.

10:31.849 --> 10:32.750
Where have they been trained?

10:32.890 --> 10:35.914
Cambridge and places like that.

10:36.675 --> 10:40.440
Western European institutions, mostly in the UK.

10:40.859 --> 10:52.395
And so when I got back to Rome to write this report, and I saw this soil fertility or infertility problem everywhere I went.

10:52.695 --> 11:04.731
I got back to Rome, I wrote this report and I suggested that the Rockefeller Foundation and FAO set up a program, a practical training program, to pick out the best young people.

11:05.512 --> 11:06.433
We couldn't handle many.

11:08.196 --> 11:10.579
Six to eight each year at the most.

11:11.420 --> 11:19.470
be sent to Mexico, financed by the Rockefeller Foundation, identified by FAO, from those countries.

11:19.490 --> 11:25.758
And we would give them a hands-on training in the Mexican program, where they could see what the payoff had been.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.542
They could see it on farms as well.

11:29.863 --> 11:36.211
And then, at the same time, it so happened that they were holding a FAO.

11:38.534 --> 11:40.617
Frank Parker was then

11:41.086 --> 11:52.144
He was one of the good soil scientists, Americans, holding a world conference on fertilizer.

11:52.865 --> 12:00.958
And so I spent a couple of days with him and gave him a good push about the disaster of no fertilizer in this country.

12:01.799 --> 12:07.448
So the report went in and the next year these people started to come to Mexico.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.813
I think the first year we had six or seven.

12:14.817 --> 12:31.139
One from Libya, from Egypt, from Lebanon, or from Syria, excuse me, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan.

12:31.160 --> 12:31.680
No Indians.

12:33.022 --> 12:36.887
They didn't think that this was sophisticated enough.

12:36.927 --> 12:38.970
Nobody would know anything in Mexico.

12:40.351 --> 12:41.232
they fell?

12:41.252 --> 12:41.493
Sure.

12:43.335 --> 12:44.577
The Pakistanis were there.

12:46.820 --> 13:00.279
And of course, we didn't have, we were down to practically no staff, so I used to work with pretty much full-time with these people, but integrate them right into the Mexican program.

13:00.780 --> 13:06.308
But I would spend two, two and a half hours every morning with them,

13:06.828 --> 13:16.498
starting in with a little Spanish, a few words so that they could communicate, and then about the various aspects, the breeding, the soils, and the this and the that and the other.

13:16.978 --> 13:33.375
Then we'd put them so many days in actually making crosses and tagging plants and selecting, or out there with fertilizer tests and try to give them an insight into all of those things.

13:35.498 --> 13:37.380
direct participation.

13:38.381 --> 13:51.016
And going out on farms, out on the irrigation districts, farmers' co-ops, the first group stayed a year.

13:51.036 --> 13:51.637
First groups.

13:51.697 --> 13:55.041
Then we had to cut it back when the demand grew to six months.

13:56.022 --> 14:00.608
But, of course, these little dwarf wheats were really hot.

14:01.489 --> 14:04.172
And these boys used to start

14:05.620 --> 14:16.629
I've already mentioned that we had this international stem rust nursery that was coordinated by the USDA that went back to 1950 or 51 that was going to all of these countries.

14:18.911 --> 14:32.763
In 1958 we had established the first inter-American spring wheat yield nursery.

14:32.964 --> 14:34.665
This was at the request

14:35.135 --> 14:39.141
of my Latin American scientific colleagues.

14:39.161 --> 14:50.035
I should have pointed out that going way back in 1948, Herrera and Wellhausen and I, Niederhauser, organized the first Latin American science wing.

14:50.216 --> 14:55.143
The first one was in breeding on wheat and corn.

14:55.163 --> 15:04.956
And I think we had about eight people from South American countries, that's all we could find, that were of that caliber.

15:06.067 --> 15:10.413
or a few people, and then some of our junior staff that presented little short papers.

15:10.433 --> 15:13.197
That was the first Latin American science meeting.

15:13.217 --> 15:17.163
The next year it was on plant pathology and entomology.

15:18.465 --> 15:25.395
By 1958, this had grown into a pretty big organization.

15:26.797 --> 15:29.420
Not by standards of today, but for the time.

15:30.281 --> 15:34.167
And it was holding its meeting in 58 in Santiago, Chile.

15:35.429 --> 15:51.493
And at that meeting, the wheat scientist said, look, why don't we establish a uniform yield test where we include the main varieties of spring weeds from Canada, the US, Mexico, Guatemala, all of the Latin countries.

15:51.513 --> 15:58.423
And so I said, all right, you send me seed and I'll grow the seed and multiply it and we'll make up the test and send them out.

15:58.443 --> 16:01.247
And so that we started to get going.

16:01.648 --> 16:03.951
And of course, these students,

16:04.319 --> 16:16.116
used to participate in taking the notes on these yield tests and also summarizing the data when they came in and preparing the thing.

16:16.177 --> 16:20.203
We had the seed plots for the next year's test and we'd decide which ones.

16:20.944 --> 16:28.595
We soon had more than we could put into the 25 varieties, so we'd have to choose.

16:28.615 --> 16:30.698
And they participated in this.

16:30.796 --> 16:39.509
Second year, they said, well, that was before we had the dwarfs in the thing.

16:39.529 --> 16:54.171
And by then, we had quite a bit of data already that showed that the Canadian northern hard red springs, even the Argentinians, wouldn't fit anywhere in lower latitudes.

16:54.522 --> 16:58.587
length of day sensitive to the point where they were completely ineffective.

16:58.607 --> 17:01.911
That's why we'd never been able to use them.

17:01.931 --> 17:04.034
And it was becoming ever more clear.

17:05.055 --> 17:17.931
And so they said, well, why don't we make one near Middle East Mexican yield test, the students said, so we don't have all of this garbage.

17:19.153 --> 17:21.696
I said, all right, let's make one.

17:21.816 --> 17:24.259
So we started to get varieties from their country.

17:24.897 --> 17:34.886
But we would put one Canadian or one US, generally two, of these sensitive so that we could, that everybody would see.

17:34.966 --> 17:36.968
So we started having this one also.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.491
So we had two of them that we were coordinating.

17:40.632 --> 17:51.462
The one across the Americas, from Argentina to Canada, that had representatives of all of the commercial varieties, plus some experimental ones.

17:52.243 --> 17:53.824
Then the one going

17:54.023 --> 18:02.716
from Pakistan to Mexico with just those except for two cheques that fit the short days.

18:04.238 --> 18:07.082
Well, this was pretty interesting to them.

18:07.363 --> 18:14.774
After three years, then we scrubbed those two and made one, the International Spring Wheat Yeel Nursery.

18:14.794 --> 18:18.900
This has gone on now for twenty-some years.

18:19.252 --> 18:26.282
And that has generated tremendous information on adaptation, response to diseases.

18:26.302 --> 18:30.888
It's grown at about 175 locations around the world at the present time.

18:31.469 --> 18:32.170
My goodness.

18:32.190 --> 18:34.153
And all the data comes back in.

18:34.613 --> 18:41.843
And this is not just on disease, but its yield of grain and maturity and height and a whole series of data.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.405
And where's the center for the data?

18:44.286 --> 18:46.550
It comes into our CIMIT Center.

18:46.570 --> 18:49.073
It goes through the computers and we get

18:49.694 --> 18:51.456
a little summary that goes out to everybody.

18:51.977 --> 18:53.259
And it's kind of like a Bible.

18:53.659 --> 19:00.809
He who knows how to use it, knows how to plan ahead for their program, their own breeding programs, their national program.

19:00.829 --> 19:05.736
Then we soon added another screening.

19:06.757 --> 19:14.248
All of the thousands or millions of plants we handle in the Mexican cement program each year.

19:15.289 --> 19:18.874
The best, about a thousand go into

19:19.394 --> 19:21.978
preliminary yield test, replicated plots.

19:22.519 --> 19:23.820
From this we picked the 250 best.

19:25.343 --> 19:32.193
One envelope from each of those made into sets and goes to about 225 places around the world.

19:32.233 --> 19:39.363
We encourage these people to select the best for their own use, name them, do whatever they want to, reselect them.

19:39.423 --> 19:44.451
This has fed lots of material into those programs.

19:44.531 --> 19:45.452
It gives

19:46.883 --> 19:52.689
These young people who know this material, they can grab some of those and run and become famous with them in a hurry.

19:52.869 --> 19:54.111
Give them national names.

19:55.032 --> 20:03.400
All of this goes back to those early few years before we had those tests, this international one.

20:03.440 --> 20:06.183
These young people would take samples of all of the things.

20:06.464 --> 20:09.527
I used to tell them, take whatever you want, a little sample.

20:11.028 --> 20:12.570
And after 19...

20:13.023 --> 20:15.886
61, we'd start getting letters.

20:15.906 --> 20:17.729
Some of these look pretty good over here.

20:18.349 --> 20:19.991
62, more so.

20:21.012 --> 20:30.023
And by then, in Pakistan, Ford Foundation was there, and they were in bad shape, just like India was in food.

20:30.884 --> 20:37.832
But the first Pakistani came in 60, fall of 60.

20:38.588 --> 20:41.512
And say for one year in Mexico.

20:41.592 --> 20:41.832
Right.

20:41.892 --> 20:47.740
And then another one came the next year, and every year for ten years or so, there were sometimes two or three.

20:48.781 --> 20:49.923
And they'd take back samples.

20:50.343 --> 20:51.184
Same way to Egypt.

20:51.224 --> 20:54.448
Those were the two that got the thing going.

20:56.711 --> 21:02.859
And then Swami Nath and so on, that international rust nursery, not the yield nursery, he didn't go any of those.

21:02.879 --> 21:04.161
They didn't want to participate.

21:05.903 --> 21:07.245
That wasn't sophisticated enough.

21:07.698 --> 21:15.988
But he saw in that USDA International Rust Nursery, those five little weeds, little dwarf ones.

21:16.008 --> 21:31.506
And so he went to his superiors and to Ralph Cummings of the Rockefeller Foundation who had a small corn program in India and asked if it would be possible to have me come and talk to them about their wheat program.

21:31.526 --> 21:37.333
So I went and I saw, this would have been in 63, spring.

21:37.820 --> 21:41.644
I saw those, I was there for a month.

21:41.684 --> 21:48.111
Traveled around, looked at their experiment stations and looked at those little five wheats and they were pretty miserable damn things.

21:48.311 --> 21:51.595
They were the earliest ones that we ever put in an international test.

21:52.916 --> 22:05.970
And he asked if, that is Swamy Natham, who is now the director of Erie, he was then a very junior wheat scientist in the botany division, later moved up through the ranks to become the director of the Indian Agriculture

22:06.389 --> 22:17.022
Research Institute and then the head of the Indian Council for Agricultural Research and then the head of the Planning Commission before he went to Rice Institute.

22:17.042 --> 22:20.546
But at that time, he was in the third echelon.

22:22.288 --> 22:32.601
And present at the last meeting was Dr. Pal, who was then the director of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute and the Dean of Agriculture, Dr. A.B.

22:32.621 --> 22:33.021
Joshi.

22:33.659 --> 22:54.139
and I said, well, I can't tell you whether these have a chance of contributing anything to your wheat program or not, but I can see that you've got the same trouble we used to have all of these damn tall varieties, and if you try to fertilize it, it's all down on the ground.

22:55.220 --> 22:57.363
But I said, I can find out if you're interested.

22:57.503 --> 23:02.788
I'll stop in Pakistan on the way back, and in Egypt, and I'll tell you whether these things will fit.

23:04.051 --> 23:10.679
So, I arranged to fly to Pakistan and to Egypt and route back.

23:13.082 --> 23:24.916
When I got there, I had advised Aldor Hanson, who was the head of the Ford Foundation activities in Pakistan.

23:25.897 --> 23:33.366
He was a newspaper man himself, not an agricultural scientist, but nonetheless, later, ten years later,

23:34.358 --> 23:35.059
or a little more.

23:35.339 --> 23:38.524
He became the director general of Ciment when Weillhausen retired.

23:39.765 --> 23:46.895
But he had told them that I was coming and so the Secretary of Agriculture was there at Lahore.

23:47.676 --> 24:02.256
All of their scientists and a few farmers, Hal Hanson, we looked at the wheat plots and the ones that they had close to the director's office, the Mexican wheats didn't look good at all compared to their

24:02.877 --> 24:07.564
but I could see they planted them the wrong times and they hadn't fertilized them right.

24:09.266 --> 24:14.033
And I kept, the director kept explaining these plots and I said, but you haven't planted these right.

24:14.153 --> 24:17.277
He said, well, I said, you didn't fertilize them enough, you didn't.

24:17.458 --> 24:18.880
And we're still in India now?

24:18.900 --> 24:19.721
You're in Pakistan.

24:19.881 --> 24:20.442
Oh, so, okay.

24:20.482 --> 24:21.323
This is when I was in Pakistan.

24:21.383 --> 24:22.685
So you're on your way back now?

24:22.765 --> 24:23.727
Looking, looking at it.

24:23.747 --> 24:24.828
Okay, okay.

24:25.068 --> 24:29.214
And I said, I can't tell him what you've done to these weeds.

24:29.234 --> 24:31.838
And he said, well, this is the way you've got to grow wheat in Pakistan.

24:32.324 --> 24:40.031
I wasn't at all convinced, but we had supper at the staff house.

24:40.412 --> 24:53.084
Hanson and I stayed there that night in different rooms, and these two young people who had been in Mexico the last two years came to me after we had our chicken and curry.

24:53.304 --> 25:02.213
They were leaving before Hal and I went to our room, and they said,

25:02.632 --> 25:05.636
We know you're leaving at 10 on the flight at 10 o'clock tomorrow.

25:05.837 --> 25:07.599
We got something we want to show you early.

25:09.241 --> 25:09.922
I said, what time?

25:10.223 --> 25:11.144
He said, daylight.

25:11.765 --> 25:12.927
I said, all right, I'll be ready.

25:16.071 --> 25:18.555
Before we went to bed that time, I talked to Hal.

25:18.595 --> 25:23.342
He always carries a little Scotch whiskey, so we had one of those.

25:24.223 --> 25:30.512
It's Muslim country, of course, and so we had one in our bedroom before we went to bed.

25:30.880 --> 25:35.785
And I said, by God, the way they planted those things, Mexican weeds didn't have a chance.

25:37.267 --> 25:49.340
So, at daylight, they were ready, and I went out with these two young people, Bajwa, who was the head of all of their wheat program at the present time, Mohammed Bajwa, and Noah Chowdhury.

25:50.882 --> 25:56.348
And way in the back corner of the station, there they were, four strips about

25:57.155 --> 25:59.838
half as wide as this room, about 20 meters long.

26:00.459 --> 26:00.759
Beautiful.

26:01.320 --> 26:04.863
Just as beautiful as they were in the Yaqui Valley.

26:04.883 --> 26:11.531
And I said, why the hell didn't you grow them like that out there where all of the demonstration plots were by the director's house?

26:12.492 --> 26:13.413
He said, they wouldn't let us.

26:17.377 --> 26:18.298
I could see that feeling.

26:18.318 --> 26:18.759
Jealousy?

26:19.159 --> 26:19.399
Sure.

26:20.080 --> 26:26.487
I went to Cairo, went out to the Saka station, or El Ham Talat,

26:27.293 --> 26:34.120
who was in that same first group, he had a lot of these weeds that he had taken back growing.

26:34.140 --> 26:36.703
And out by the director's place, same thing, miserable.

26:37.544 --> 26:39.106
Way back behind, beautiful.

26:40.427 --> 26:43.610
Same damn thing.

26:44.792 --> 26:50.318
So, when I got back to Mexico, I wrote a hasty report because we were harvesting.

26:50.998 --> 26:52.460
Told them that these things would go.

26:53.101 --> 26:57.165
To get going, we'd send them some seed.

26:57.652 --> 26:58.433
That's the way it went.

26:58.673 --> 27:05.199
Next year, Pakistan imported a couple hundred kilos of seed.

27:05.860 --> 27:19.372
The second year, we sent in, to India, we sent in about 250 limes in small rows and about 100 kilos of four varieties.

27:19.953 --> 27:22.235
Sonora, 64, 63.

27:24.777 --> 27:27.540
Pankhamon, Lermanrojo.

27:28.398 --> 27:29.480
Same to Pakistan.

27:32.103 --> 27:36.930
And in 63 I spent a month in Pakistan, or in India.

27:37.872 --> 27:44.942
Every year I've been going to Pakistan from 60 on.

27:44.962 --> 27:56.278
Did the same strain that worked well in that back part in Pakistan work well, first in Pakistan when they decided to do it properly, to plant it properly, and second in India?

27:59.600 --> 28:07.410
And after one year, that was 63, or 64 when we sent in 100 kilos.

28:08.372 --> 28:19.927
Then we got Glen Anderson over there in India, and at the same time we put Narvaez, head of the Mexican program, another guy was back to take that over in Pakistan.

28:20.668 --> 28:28.138
And then we start to move, 65, 300 tons of...

28:30.970 --> 28:34.796
Mexican wheat seed to India, 350 to Pakistan.

28:35.957 --> 28:42.226
It was shipped out about the last day of August.

28:42.286 --> 28:49.897
I don't remember the exact, but you can find out it was the day before the war broke out between India and Pakistan.

28:50.839 --> 28:55.385
Everything went wrong with that ship.

28:55.405 --> 28:58.149
Couldn't get it across the border because of red tape.

28:58.910 --> 29:00.893
They were holding and paying damage on the

29:01.244 --> 29:02.565
a freighter in Los Angeles.

29:04.367 --> 29:12.936
Finally, when it got across, Narvaez was there loading it, and Wellhausen was on vacation, so he insisted I stay in the office.

29:12.956 --> 29:17.201
I'm like a mad tiger when I have to stay in the office.

29:17.221 --> 29:22.507
And, finally, we got it across the border, thirty truckloads.

29:24.869 --> 29:27.572
And then, that weekend, the Watts riots were on.

29:27.822 --> 29:31.468
to confuse the highway transport.

29:31.488 --> 29:36.035
Finally, I got a call Saturday noon from Narvaez.

29:36.075 --> 29:42.545
He said, the trucks are here and we're loading and we'll ship out either early morning or late tonight.

29:43.446 --> 29:44.568
He says, is everything in order?

29:44.588 --> 29:49.075
And I said, I got a check here that nobody wants to cash.

29:49.957 --> 29:54.083
The check was made to the Mexican seed organization, PRONACE.

29:54.890 --> 29:59.577
national producer of seed for the Mexican government.

29:59.597 --> 30:03.804
They had three misspelled words on it and the bank wouldn't cash it.

30:04.365 --> 30:06.188
So, I said, I'll fix it on Monday morning.

30:07.250 --> 30:15.042
Well, to make a long story short, next afternoon the war was on and all hell broke loose.

30:15.376 --> 30:19.400
Then, of course, the Mexican seed organization wanted to know where their money was.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.842
This was Pakistan check.

30:23.643 --> 30:28.127
The Indian check was paid by the foundation, so there was no problem there.

30:29.468 --> 30:33.492
So, they kept calling me every two or three hours.

30:33.512 --> 30:35.494
Of course, I was helpless.

30:38.096 --> 30:43.881
But I wired the Minister of Agriculture in Pakistan and thought I was in a hell of a shape.

30:44.300 --> 30:47.983
About a week later, I got a telegram back from me.

30:48.123 --> 30:53.368
He says, I got trouble too with bombs falling in my front yard over here, but something's wrong with that check.

30:53.408 --> 30:57.591
The money was deposited and we'll get it straightened around, which eventually happened.

30:57.711 --> 31:05.037
This seed organization reported this to New York Rockfellow office.

31:05.057 --> 31:14.205
What a miserable administrator I was, and it really got to be muddy before the thing was unsettled.

31:14.607 --> 31:23.082
Narvaez went to Pakistan to start planting in the Anderson in India, and I went first to Pakistan.

31:23.102 --> 31:24.905
The ship was delayed.

31:26.287 --> 31:34.101
They figured it would all be confiscated in Bombay, in Pakistan, so they unloaded the Pakistan stuff in Singapore.

31:34.975 --> 31:41.103
And then there was a jam up with the war on in the harbor, both in Bombay and in Karachi.

31:41.123 --> 31:45.188
That delayed it, and we had to get military permission to move it through.

31:45.869 --> 31:49.835
The result was that it got there a month too late.

31:51.777 --> 31:53.840
So, we had no chance to check the germination.

31:53.860 --> 31:58.566
We started planting, and I told you already, miserable germination.

31:58.586 --> 32:03.092
So, we had to send out telegrams through the minister in both countries.

32:03.393 --> 32:04.995
Narvaez and I in Pakistan.

32:05.937 --> 32:08.481
Anderson was in India, and we couldn't communicate with him.

32:08.521 --> 32:11.585
We didn't know whether he knew what was happening.

32:13.388 --> 32:17.715
Talked to the minister and told him we had to send telegrams to double the seeding rates.

32:17.915 --> 32:18.816
He wasn't very happy.

32:18.897 --> 32:21.180
I wouldn't have been either, but he did.

32:26.789 --> 32:32.337
We had still a poor stand, but we put on more fertilizer and more water, and by the time harvest,

32:32.823 --> 32:34.885
rolled along, everybody thought it was very good.

32:35.306 --> 32:40.792
It was only probably 75% of what it should have been, but it was good by comparison.

32:41.433 --> 33:01.497
In the same way, as soon as we saw what had happened, I wired Wellhausen back in Mexico, my chief, and told him what had happened, and he talked to the minister, and the minister sent inspectors up to the government seed warehouses, took out those samples, and I told you they germinated anywhere from 10 to 30%.

33:01.612 --> 33:03.134
because of overfumigation.

33:04.936 --> 33:12.066
The government seed organization had been blaming this on the shipping line.

33:12.086 --> 33:14.509
Of course, that was just a way out.

33:16.371 --> 33:20.837
And I told Wellhausen to wire Anderson and tell him to double the seeding rates.

33:22.259 --> 33:28.547
So then I left Pakistan and went back to the Arab countries and flew to South India and up.

33:28.882 --> 33:32.346
found Anderson had done the same thing as we'd done in Pakistan.

33:33.287 --> 33:37.373
And they kept putting more fertilizer and more water and they tillered well there too.

33:37.873 --> 33:42.319
By then the drought and hunger was miserable in both countries, worse in India.

33:43.440 --> 33:50.569
And that harvest, even Sourmaniam,

33:51.477 --> 33:56.163
ordered 18,000 tons of Mexican wheat seed.

33:56.183 --> 34:10.239
He sent three people over to buy it, inspect it in the field, erogue it, new sacks, clean it, ship it, and it arrived 99 percent germination.

34:12.282 --> 34:16.827
So, from one year from 300 tons of wheat seed to 18,000 tons the next year?

34:17.600 --> 34:18.201
in India.

34:19.021 --> 34:24.847
Pakistan didn't import any in 66, 67 they imported 32,000 tons.

34:24.987 --> 34:29.892
How about the productivity?

34:30.032 --> 34:33.115
How about the increase in production?

34:33.275 --> 34:46.628
Was it the same type of fantastic results over the years as it was in Mexico, for example, going from 10 to 100 bushels?

34:46.777 --> 34:51.782
In India, we wanted to stack the cards in those early times.

34:52.183 --> 34:53.944
I wanted to show what the potential was.

34:54.625 --> 35:01.292
Out on special tests on farms, we ran a series of levels of fertilizers so you could plot the curve.

35:01.632 --> 35:09.901
The response was 40, 80, 120, 160 kilos of nitrogen per hectare.

35:09.921 --> 35:16.227
But out on the demonstrations, I always wanted 120 minimum.

35:17.270 --> 35:20.975
to provoke shock.

35:20.995 --> 35:23.598
I didn't want any of this 40 kilos.

35:24.680 --> 35:41.742
Maybe it was the weather and maybe it was better this year than the last because I've been through the shock treatment and everybody was saying, ah, in Mexico you maybe were able to convince those farmers, but our farmers are ultra-conservative, both India and Pakistan.

35:42.633 --> 35:49.764
And of course, I had these economists hanging around my neck all the time, trying to tell me what levels of fertilizer I should be putting on.

35:50.264 --> 35:52.247
They were worried about equity already.

35:52.788 --> 35:58.076
When I wasn't worried a damn bit about equity at this point, I just wanted to provoke shock.

35:58.096 --> 36:03.645
This was with the 300, but especially with that 18,000, awesome.

36:03.665 --> 36:08.852
I said, I want such a big difference that a blind man can see it.

36:09.493 --> 36:11.897
And I want the grass roots to catch fire.

36:12.957 --> 36:18.762
this isn't the time to worry about equity of distribution of that fertilizer.

36:18.782 --> 36:22.265
And it was pretty heated discussions.

36:23.686 --> 36:25.208
And I won.

36:27.870 --> 36:38.319
And when you looked at it, you knew in 67 that it was going to fly.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.002
Spring of 67.

36:43.433 --> 36:46.898
And every time you'd stop... The crops were coming up at that rate.

36:47.599 --> 37:11.010
Every time you'd look at those fields, driving a jeep, pick up, stop, Anderson, Swami, Nath, and I in India, and Nacho, and Kreshi in Pakistan, you stop to look at these plots, farmer's fields, you didn't want to spend too much time, you just want to get there.

37:11.328 --> 37:13.291
and look just to see as many as possible.

37:14.232 --> 37:24.127
And hell, there were 200, 300 people standing by the Jeep when you got back out and somebody grabbed you by the sleeve and point down the road, you're supposed to come and see his.

37:25.448 --> 37:29.815
And there was no question any longer.

37:31.678 --> 37:38.247
The last day in India, for example, I should go back, retrogress again,

37:41.315 --> 37:54.736
Pakistan made the decision on pricing before India, even though it didn't bring in that second year in 66 any more seed.

37:54.796 --> 38:03.290
It had the product from those 350 tons, enough to put on pretty big on-farm demonstration.

38:05.033 --> 38:07.677
And before that, at a meeting

38:08.365 --> 38:10.348
See, I'm going back a year now.

38:10.408 --> 38:11.950
I'm sorry to confuse this.

38:12.411 --> 38:25.910
But in Pakistan, the minister had invited Hal Hanson, Narvaez, and I to come to Lahore when the president had one of his big political meetings there.

38:27.132 --> 38:34.662
Now, Narvaez had put in the president Ayub Khan's orchard, citrus orchard, between the rows.

38:35.443 --> 38:37.967
He planted one of those early,

38:38.369 --> 38:43.176
best weeds and he fertilized it heavily and it was beautiful.

38:43.196 --> 38:47.623
The president saw it and he had gotten interested in this.

38:47.683 --> 38:51.689
He was a farmer himself.

38:53.972 --> 39:07.212
So, the minister wanted us to come to this, it was really political meeting, there were hundreds and hundreds of people there and after all of the talking, before the final wrap-up

39:07.985 --> 39:12.590
They have tea hallways, the English custom.

39:12.730 --> 39:32.252
And up on the speaker's platform, so high off the ground that this beautiful big governor's mansion, lawn, the minister came down to Hanson and Narvaez and I, he said, Borlaug, the minister says the president wants to talk to you.

39:32.272 --> 39:34.414
So I went up there and he said, you know,

39:34.850 --> 39:49.990
The president of Pakistan, Ayub Khan, he was a graduate, he was a general, a graduate from Sandhurst in Britain.

39:50.010 --> 39:51.652
A good administrative officer also.

39:52.674 --> 39:59.122
And he said, I've been impressed with that wheat I see out in my orchard and with the other things that they have shown me.

39:59.703 --> 40:02.747
He said, what do I do now to make this go?

40:03.470 --> 40:05.953
And so I said, all right, we gotta have fertilizer.

40:07.555 --> 40:09.758
And about this kind and about this much.

40:10.098 --> 40:12.020
We gotta have credit for that little guy to buy it.

40:13.923 --> 40:16.886
So that he can buy the fertilizer at time of planting, pay for your harvest.

40:16.926 --> 40:20.631
And then you've gotta pre-announce the price of wheat before planting.

40:20.971 --> 40:24.716
And it has to reflect the price of the international market.

40:26.198 --> 40:28.340
And I say, all of these pieces have to go together.

40:28.821 --> 40:29.802
You've got the seed now.

40:30.062 --> 40:30.983
We know how to plant it.

40:31.504 --> 40:32.245
That's been done.

40:32.528 --> 40:35.771
but you gotta get all of these pieces together in that right package.

40:36.472 --> 40:37.953
And I said, it's no different.

40:38.374 --> 40:42.778
I said, I'm gonna talk to you as though it were in a military advance.

40:43.338 --> 40:51.126
You gotta have the coordination between the Air Corps and the tanks and the infantry or else nothing happens except you get all chewed up.

40:51.766 --> 40:54.669
And this is the way it is in all of these inner disciplines.

40:55.590 --> 40:57.151
He says, I catch you.

40:57.171 --> 41:00.915
And so we left.

41:01.672 --> 41:08.641
That night we went back to Karachi, and Hanson and I, and we wrote the report for the month that we'd been there.

41:08.661 --> 41:12.646
And I made this recommendation about this fertilizer.

41:12.666 --> 41:22.118
Hanson got all upset the month that I was asking for, and also the price for the grain.

41:23.700 --> 41:29.147
And he wouldn't believe me on the fertilizer, and finally he called Haldor

41:30.477 --> 41:38.727
Advar Arsik, who was a Norwegian economist that Hansen had taken out from the Harvard group and put as a confidant of the minister.

41:40.950 --> 41:51.984
And Advar always used to travel with Nacho and I. He's the only economist that ever used to go with us everywhere in the field to see those plots.

41:53.646 --> 41:56.029
And he knew.

41:56.768 --> 42:00.532
Hal says, this damn guy, Norm here, he's crazy about this fertilizer.

42:00.712 --> 42:03.655
He says, here's what he's requested.

42:03.676 --> 42:06.098
He says, how much should I cut it back?

42:07.199 --> 42:14.888
And Advar says, the amount is right, ordered or requested.

42:14.908 --> 42:20.514
And we talked about the credit and about the pricing.

42:20.534 --> 42:21.595
And Advar says, okay.

42:22.604 --> 42:28.612
And so Hassan was convinced and he wrote a letter, he wrote jointly a letter to the Ayub.

42:29.333 --> 42:32.758
And I left to catch the plane to go back to Mexico.

42:32.778 --> 42:38.806
And he said, I'll give this letter to Ayub tomorrow, hand delivered, which he did.

42:39.006 --> 42:43.792
And in a week, Ayub made all of those decisions, just like that.

42:44.073 --> 42:49.540
And that put them ahead of Pakistan, of India.

42:49.773 --> 42:52.698
So they did all three things right there, right on the spot?

42:52.718 --> 42:53.018
In a week.

42:53.038 --> 42:54.380
What year was this, 66?

42:54.641 --> 42:58.266
This was in the 66.

43:01.672 --> 43:03.234
Because the president was behind it.

43:05.137 --> 43:09.384
And that knocks down a lot of the bureaucrats who were trying to trip you up and knock you down.

43:10.605 --> 43:12.629
And what were the results of next year?

43:12.669 --> 43:15.493
Damn near self-sufficient.

43:16.047 --> 43:45.987
no not the next year two years down the road 66 very good all right now we move on to 67 because in 66 right at this time when I got back to Mexico I got a telegram I'd been in India first that Indian government was sending three people to buy 18,000 tons of seed so I went with them up to farther north because the harvest was already done when we got the telegram in the Yaqui Valley so I went to Irmasil and helped them

43:46.304 --> 44:14.033
get the things in order they imported that planted all of that the next year and that's when we got in the big fight with the economist in India about how much fertilizer well before we get into that tell me about the production increases in Pakistan in those plots in those plots well it's still in the first year the 350 tons of course

44:16.409 --> 44:33.547
would only have been about 3,500 hectares, no impact on total production, but with the way we had the fertilizer stack, even with the bad germination, we had 75, 80 bushel wheat.

44:33.788 --> 44:42.317
The next year, where he was setting the stage for it, we had 95, 1995.

44:43.198 --> 44:45.420
Not all of them, but I mean, you could see that,

44:45.721 --> 44:49.386
What you want is the maximum to show the people.

44:49.406 --> 44:54.714
Then you have to cut back because you know that for several years you aren't going to have that much fertilizer.

44:54.794 --> 44:57.418
And that's where you have to have the equity of distribution.

44:57.978 --> 45:05.109
You have to go to sixty kilos per hectare on twice as much land or even forty.

45:06.551 --> 45:11.037
So you cut back the fertilizer fifty percent or maybe even sixty percent.

45:11.472 --> 45:12.834
So you can distribute it to all the people.

45:12.854 --> 45:14.196
Because you don't have enough, yeah.

45:14.216 --> 45:20.425
So you can distribute it to all the people, and then at that time you had enough seed for nationwide.

45:20.826 --> 45:23.089
Well, not the first one.

45:23.710 --> 45:25.072
But the second year you did.

45:25.092 --> 45:26.495
The second year, pretty much.

45:27.156 --> 45:32.163
Except that then there was a new kind of weed out in Mexico that they preferred.

45:32.624 --> 45:40.095
So that's when they came over and bought the 32,000 tons, and they forced the Mexican government into...

45:40.852 --> 45:51.821
into a pocket to sell them about 2,000 tons of one that they wanted badly because of its kind of grain that they preferred.

45:52.842 --> 46:05.333
But now... And what was a result as far as productions two years down the line where they sell some... In 68, which was when you resigned, I happened to be there and looked at the harvest.

46:05.353 --> 46:09.897
I went into, with Hanson, Narvaez and Harthik, the same economists.

46:11.041 --> 46:27.197
No, Hanson had been transferred by then to Africa, and so there was another man there from Michigan State who represented the Ford Foundation, who's now their international director of programs.

46:27.217 --> 46:28.839
His name escapes me right at the moment.

46:30.380 --> 46:39.850
Anyway, the four of us went to see Ayub and told him that the crop was

46:40.117 --> 46:44.321
essentially self-sufficiency in 68, spring of 68.

46:47.564 --> 46:49.726
It might have been self-sufficiency.

46:51.247 --> 47:07.443
And before he left, he told me, as the rest of them had left, he said, I haven't announced to the press yet, but I'm resigning tomorrow.

47:08.063 --> 47:10.005
I had a third heart attack.

47:10.880 --> 47:12.101
And he said, it'll kill me.

47:12.902 --> 47:21.670
And he said, I think it's far enough along so that it'll go, this wheat thing, this food thing.

47:23.532 --> 47:25.434
And sure enough, he announced it.

47:26.275 --> 47:33.021
And then the drum beating started, Jesus, and all of the confusion came to Pakistan.

47:33.682 --> 47:35.324
So I was writing the report.

47:35.404 --> 47:38.727
Narvaez was transferred then to Lebanon for the...
