00:09.076 --> 00:37.328
At the present time, the total protein, the ocean 
is primarily a source of food protein, either for,

00:09.076 --> 00:37.328
in terms of food, not the total resources of the 
ocean, in terms of both food for human beings, fish

00:09.076 --> 00:37.328
that people like to eat and seek, invertebrates 
people like to eat, and food for animals, fish

00:37.932 --> 00:42.878
meal, fish flour. Fish meals are fed to chicken and 
to livestock.

00:51.428 --> 01:07.146
And the total protein supply that we get this way in 
terms of human food is of the order of 12 million

00:51.428 --> 01:07.146
tons a year. 12 to 15 million tons a year of protein.

01:13.900 --> 01:19.648
If you divide that by the number of people on Earth, 
how does that look? Let me just do it.

01:27.277 --> 01:30.582
Just any place might be full. Say we have 12 times 10 
to the sixth ton. divided by 4 times 10 to the 9

01:36.320 --> 01:56.057
people equals 3 times 10 to the minus third

01:36.320 --> 01:56.057
tons per person equals 3 kilograms per person per 
year.

01:58.899 --> 02:06.225
Well, the total program, the total protein 
requirement per person is about 50

02:07.488 --> 02:35.807
times 365 equals about 18 kiloamps. So

02:37.087 --> 03:00.242
that for the world as a whole, we're providing 
about

03:04.475 --> 03:26.287
The protein requirement we're providing, the 
ocean provides

03:04.475 --> 03:26.287
three eight-teens, with one six, about 15, it's 
about, six is about 17% as opposed to the world

03:04.475 --> 03:26.287
protein, human protein.

03:27.609 --> 03:32.136
It's actually less than the world protein 
consumption, but because Americans and

03:32.808 --> 03:37.693
Europeans and Japanese eat a lot more protein. But 
anyhow, this is what people require. Well, it's

03:40.877 --> 03:46.823
not really a major factor in human protein supply. 
And it's probably true that we can't get more than

03:46.843 --> 03:57.255
100 million tons of fish out of the ocean by the 
present fishing techniques. We've exploited all

03:57.275 --> 04:00.418
resources intelligently.

04:04.195 --> 04:05.156
very effectively. Moreover, this would be quite 
an expensive way to get protein. Deep sea fishing

04:09.181 --> 04:13.347
is an energy-intensive business. It uses a lot of 
energy.

04:17.252 --> 04:31.350
So I think that, in general, the notion that the 
ocean is a great reservoir of protein is, with the

04:17.252 --> 04:31.350
present fishing techniques, is just not so.

04:34.199 --> 04:36.702
our great reservoir of food supply. Of course, 
food, we need millions of it. We need something

04:38.784 --> 04:54.202
like the total requirement right now is something 
like a billion, 200 million, 300 million, about a

04:38.784 --> 04:54.202
billion and a half million, a billion, 500 million 
tons of food, mostly for calories.

05:01.230 --> 05:02.772
But by the development of of ocean farming, we 
might be able to increase this

05:04.051 --> 05:18.471
production of things that people like and need 
maybe several fold over. And the interesting

05:18.512 --> 05:25.321
thing about ocean farming is that you do it in a 
different way than you do it on land. The best

05:25.722 --> 05:31.250
example is the mussel farming that the Spaniards 
do. They get about 100 tons to the acre of mussels

05:35.135 --> 05:39.562
maybe 20 tons to the acre of protein, which is 
fantastically high. The reason that they're able

05:40.724 --> 05:52.684
to do this is that they put their muscles on ropes or 
pilings, but mostly ropes, I think, in an area

05:40.724 --> 05:52.684
where the current constantly sweeps by them. So 
that the ocean is fertilizing itself. You're

05:57.031 --> 06:01.058
taking advantage of the organic production in a 
large part of the ocean. sweeping by these

06:01.780 --> 06:05.866
mussels, and the mussels all you do is just filter 
it out of the water as it goes by. That's why you get

06:07.348 --> 06:08.710
these high yields. And that's the way to do marine 
farming, I think, not to take a piece of ocean and

06:08.750 --> 06:15.579
fertilize it. Might as well just use ordinary 
agriculture for that. But to take advantage of the

06:19.225 --> 06:31.602
oceans, of the motions of the ocean, to make the 
ocean fertilize itself, and to

06:19.225 --> 06:31.602
bring nutrients to a small area. from which you 
then get a large crop.

06:41.972 --> 06:50.885
And I think that the energy requirements here are 
rather low.

06:50.945 --> 07:01.740
The energy requirements are primarily catching 
and handling, not so much energy for fertilizer or

06:50.945 --> 07:01.740
energy for plowing or energy for pumping water. 
the ocean will do all that for you. You have to catch

07:05.425 --> 07:06.808
the mussels. You have to hang them there. You have 
to pull them up and take them out of their shells and

07:09.171 --> 07:15.722
then do something with them. I would think 
particularly of mariculture of organisms like

07:15.742 --> 07:25.939
mussels, oysters, clams, and mussels, which are 
filter feeders. therefore can collect are just

07:26.932 --> 07:38.365
essentially little plankton nets, convert the 
plankton into something we like to eat, seafood.

07:38.385 --> 07:48.277
Plankton is impossible to eat for a variety of 
reasons, one

07:38.385 --> 07:48.277
being it has a lot of silicon. And I wouldn't be 
surprised if this were done on

07:48.297 --> 07:55.065
a If we learned how to do this and did it on a large 
scale, we couldn't double the protein production

07:55.855 --> 08:03.263
of the ocean. There should be a significant step in 
the right direction. Still not.

08:13.916 --> 08:22.926
Still, it would probably be only 20% or 25% of the 
total human protein, world population protein

08:13.916 --> 08:22.926
requirements. I don't see how the world 
population could possibly be stabilized below 10

08:23.699 --> 08:31.788
or 12 billion people.

08:31.808 --> 08:34.631
Well, so much for mariculture. I had another 
question I was going to ask you before we got on

08:34.651 --> 08:38.035
mariculture. It has to do with modifying the 
climate on the Earth. You had mentioned twice

08:42.640 --> 08:45.623
ecology. Do you think we can safely experiment, as 
a matter of fact, with modifying the climate on the

08:46.564 --> 08:52.170
Earth? Well, we're doing it. We can't do the 
paperwork, though. You were going to come back and

08:55.637 --> 08:57.580
report to me. Oh, I forgot. I was wondering if you'd 
like a little snack for lunch. It's getting on

09:03.468 --> 09:05.751
toward that time. I don't have any honey, and I 
don't have any avocado to make you a honey avocado.

09:10.837 --> 09:12.940
Let me move your coffee pot over here. Yes, I would 
very much. Thank you. I think we can wind this thing

09:15.664 --> 09:19.609
up for you in a few minutes here.

09:23.470 --> 09:24.612
What was your question again? I was talking about 
modifying it twice or three times in our

09:24.632 --> 09:27.998
conversation. Something's come up with the idea 
of the ecology system and modifying the climate.

09:33.748 --> 09:35.010
We are modifying it. We probably are modifying the 
climate. That is almost certain. By adding carbon

09:39.739 --> 09:45.509
dioxide to

09:39.739 --> 09:45.509
the atmosphere. And we're adding a lot. We're 
adding now. About a half of 1% of the, every year,

09:49.087 --> 09:59.660
we're adding a half of 1% of the atmospheric carbon 
dioxide to the atmosphere.

09:59.680 --> 10:00.220
We're pretty close to that. And this is something 
that we don't want to do. We're just doing it by

10:03.705 --> 10:05.807
burning fossil fuels. And the real question is, 
what's going to happen? It's a great geophysical

10:09.952 --> 10:12.596
experiment in one way. It's also maybe a great 
concern to human beings. Now, the ocean enters

10:18.196 --> 10:20.699
into this in a profound way. We're actually 
burning fossil fuels about carbon dioxide

10:22.502 --> 10:42.668
production is about 1% of the atmospheric carbon 
dioxide every year,

10:22.502 --> 10:42.668
going up to 3% or 4% maybe in 100 years if we keep on 
burning coal.

10:47.002 --> 10:49.926
But about half of this at the present time goes into 
the ocean. What do you think? An unknown

10:54.832 --> 11:03.964
proportion goes into the biosphere, and maybe not 
any goes into the biosphere, but maybe a

10:54.832 --> 11:03.964
significant amount.

11:03.984 --> 11:08.911
The land biosphere,

11:03.984 --> 11:08.911
I think. The reason that we're able to absorb half 
of it in the ocean is that the ocean has something

11:08.931 --> 11:15.439
called a bucker mechanism of seawater. That is, 
there are carbonate ions in the ocean which have

11:16.330 --> 11:26.865
two negative charges that can be turned into 
bicarbonate if you add CO2. Bicarbonate has only

11:28.106 --> 11:32.693
one negative charge.

11:32.713 --> 11:43.688
As long as the carbonate ion is present,

11:32.713 --> 11:43.688
the ocean can absorb CO2 by transforming the 
carbonate into bicarbonate. However, it looks as

11:44.984 --> 11:55.921
if, as time goes on, we're going to use up the 
carbonate ion in the ocean, and therefore the

11:44.984 --> 11:55.921
ocean won't be able to absorb very much CO2. Most of 
it will stay in the atmosphere. So that will make

11:58.946 --> 12:04.795
the situation worse than it is

11:58.946 --> 12:04.795
now. Moreover, if we do this, we're going to heat up 
the surface waters of the ocean because the

12:04.815 --> 12:13.388
atmosphere will get warm again. And they won't be 
able to hold so much carbonic acid gas. So more

12:19.024 --> 12:27.273
carbon dioxide will get into the air from the 
ocean,

12:19.024 --> 12:27.273
because the ocean will be losing it. Moreover,

12:27.293 --> 12:40.287
as the atmosphere heats up and as the ocean surface 
layer heats up, there will be more evaporation and

12:27.293 --> 12:40.287
more cloud formation. This may be a 
countervailing effect. Nobody really knows what

12:43.015 --> 13:07.980
the effect will be, whether it will increase the 
albedo of the earth, that is, the reflectivity, so

12:43.015 --> 13:07.980
we get less incoming radiation, or whether it 
will, in fact, increase the temperature in order

12:43.015 --> 13:07.980
to get, because clouds radiate infrared at a lower 
temperature than the ground surface does, you may

12:43.015 --> 13:07.980
therefore have to raise the temperature in order 
to get enough radiation out to maintain a heat

12:43.015 --> 13:07.980
balance. I'm quite uncertain what's going to 
happen. All the climatic models

13:11.350 --> 13:18.881
are fatally weak because they're unable to model 
the ocean. And they're unable to modify the cloud

13:21.464 --> 13:25.570
formation of the ocean. You have to learn how to do 
this. And this will be, I think, a combination of

13:28.013 --> 13:32.259
observation and theory. It can't be done by either 
one alone. You observe cloud formation over the

13:35.524 --> 13:37.847
ocean. You observe the albedo of the clouds and 
their infrared radiation and see what happens in

13:38.705 --> 13:49.798
different areas under the variations we now get. 
And from this, develop a better theory of cloud

13:50.499 --> 13:56.526
formation and a better theory of the interaction 
between the sea and the air.

14:00.070 --> 14:05.016
One thing that's characteristic of the ocean is 
that it carries about half the heat. from low

14:06.110 --> 14:07.651
latitudes to high latitudes. The other half is 
carried in the air. Nobody knows whether it's 40%

14:11.795 --> 14:14.377
or 50% or 60%. That makes a lot of difference in 
models, not in space models. Present

14:19.321 --> 14:24.266
climatological models assume one of two things 
about the ocean. Either that the ocean is a swamp

14:24.326 --> 14:35.155
from which water can evaporate but no heat can be 
absorbed because it's such a thin layer of water,

14:24.326 --> 14:35.155
or that it's got an infinite heat capacity. 
Neither of which is true. The truth is somewhere in

14:38.042 --> 14:41.146
between. And the models just can't take account of 
that. I don't think you're going to be able to get

14:49.797 --> 14:56.526
very much further to it unless you have a lot more 
studies of the interaction between the sea and the

14:49.797 --> 14:56.526
air. Rather than talk about climate 
modification, I'd like to talk about climate and

14:58.208 --> 15:04.956
what's going to happen to it. And the only thing we 
can say with any certainty now about climate is

15:05.662 --> 15:13.093
that the climate fluctuates. Sometimes it's one 
way, and sometimes it's another. And we know that

15:18.160 --> 15:20.003
it always has fluctuated. The longer the period of 
observation, the greater the fluctuation.

15:23.608 --> 15:28.795
That's characteristic of what are called 
stochastic processes. And it's very likely that

15:28.815 --> 15:32.040
the climate's going to get worse. It's no more 
likely that the climate will get better, but it's

15:33.202 --> 15:37.949
equally likely that it will get worse. It's going 
to vary somehow. And we have to be prudent and to act

15:41.133 --> 15:47.703
as if we're going to get worse, even though it may 
not.

15:50.527 --> 15:52.810
That means we have to do a lot of things about 
agriculture. But in order to know what to do about

15:53.591 --> 15:57.577
agriculture, we have to know what's going to 
happen. If the climate does get worse, what does

15:58.318 --> 16:01.082
that mean? Horse latitudes shift north or south. 
Does it mean you get more or less precipitation?

16:06.729 --> 16:09.233
Does it mean the pattern of precipitation 
changes? Does it mean that the temperature

16:09.673 --> 16:12.297
patterns change? And if so, in what way are they 
going to change? Climatology at the present time

16:15.642 --> 16:20.608
is a very primitive science. And half of 
climatology is oceanography. But the Global

16:24.394 --> 16:31.103
Atmospheric Research Program, which involves 
oceanography as well as meteorology, that it's

16:31.792 --> 16:43.242
just a very important thing to be doing from a 
purely practical point of view, let alone from a

16:31.792 --> 16:43.242
theoretical and scientifically interesting 
point of view. But, you know, the notion that you

16:43.262 --> 16:55.793
dam up the Bering Sea or run the Amur River into the 
Arctic or something like that, these are all

16:43.262 --> 16:55.793
trivial problems compared to the real problem. 
What's going to happen to the climate without our

16:55.813 --> 16:58.336
doing a goddamn thing? Except putting CO2 into it. 
on a very large scale? Do we have to abandon carbon

17:02.924 --> 17:07.529
dioxide in production? Do we have to abandon the 
use of fossil fuels because we're going to change

17:07.689 --> 17:13.835
the climate so drastically by continuing to use 
them? Or can we continue to use them and prepare for

17:15.056 --> 17:19.501
what changes will occur?

17:24.466 --> 17:28.630
That leads directly in effect to another question 
I have.

17:29.723 --> 17:38.213
The one thing that strikes me as consistent in your 
career, if I may use that word, or consistently

17:29.723 --> 17:38.213
apparent in your career, is the scientist as 
public man. Do you have any particular

17:39.214 --> 17:48.706
philosophical views about what the scientist's 
responsibility is to the public? Well,

17:48.726 --> 17:52.631
personally, he has the same responsibility as 
everybody else. He's a good citizen. But he also

17:55.795 --> 17:57.857
has special responsibilities.

18:03.406 --> 18:19.470
because he either knows something that other 
people don't know, or because he has ways of

18:03.406 --> 18:19.470
finding out things that other people don't know 
about.

18:19.490 --> 18:26.120
And I think that the scientist has maybe two 
responsibilities. One is to be an entertainer, to

18:26.400 --> 18:33.210
be, like other artists, give people pleasure and 
happiness. And this is particularly obvious with

18:37.125 --> 18:39.307
astronomy. People really are fascinated by 
astronomy.

18:46.033 --> 18:51.238
And it has some very deep meaning to people, which 
is hard to describe. But you can see it when you look

18:51.298 --> 18:58.845
at an audience being talked to by an astronomer or 
by somebody who talks about astronomy. They often

18:59.705 --> 19:01.527
have tears in their eyes. overwhelmingly 
emotionally involved in it. And that's the

19:05.784 --> 19:09.349
entertainment aspect of science. Seafloor 
spreading, plate tectonics,

19:09.369 --> 19:28.020
whether there's light on Mars, what's the history 
of the Earth, what's the history of living

19:09.369 --> 19:28.020
creatures, what's the diversity of living 
creatures, all their peculiar and funny ways and

19:09.369 --> 19:28.020
interesting ways.

19:29.755 --> 19:36.305
Let's leave that tentative curtain that we see out 
there in front of us. These are all kind of things

19:36.325 --> 19:42.315
that Cousteau does and that many people do. These 
are very important aspects of the scientist's

19:42.355 --> 19:47.262
responsibility to the public. After all, the 
public's paying for what he does. They ought to get

19:49.185 --> 19:50.247
something out of it. The other thing, of course, is 
that the scientist has

19:59.253 --> 20:17.277
the responsibility of laying the basis for a 
humane technology, a technology which serves the

19:59.253 --> 20:17.277
interests of people and doesn't disserve the 
interests of people. The technologists

20:17.297 --> 20:26.610
themselves have a major responsibility here, but 
most modern technology is based on science,

20:27.400 --> 20:44.222
knowledge of nature and knowledge of ourselves 
and knowledge of other living creatures,

20:27.400 --> 20:44.222
biological knowledge, scientific knowledge of 
living things and of the inanimate world. So I

20:44.242 --> 20:54.235
think

20:44.242 --> 20:54.235
one of the responsibilities of the scientists was 
to try

20:44.242 --> 20:54.235
to consider and talk about and think about, or to 
consider, think about, and talk about, put them in

20:55.531 --> 21:12.996
that order, what are the likely consequences of 
increasing, of increases in scientific

20:55.531 --> 21:12.996
knowledge?

21:14.718 --> 21:25.453
And to do that in such a way that you don't scare 
people, but you

21:14.718 --> 21:25.453
give them a chance to make intelligent choices and 
intelligent decisions. You can't make the

21:25.923 --> 21:31.910
decisions for them, but you can give them the 
knowledge by which they can make better

21:25.923 --> 21:31.910
decisions.

21:34.774 --> 21:36.816
And then the final thing is to do good science. 
That's a responsibility, too, because science is

21:36.876 --> 21:52.555
a human activity of,

21:36.876 --> 21:52.555
how to put it, Science is something that people can 
do. Finding out about the world and about

21:58.186 --> 22:06.014
ourselves is an important human activity, 
something that makes people human. It gives them a

22:06.995 --> 22:16.104
higher humanity and a more intense

22:06.995 --> 22:16.104
experience. Most scientists,

22:18.467 --> 22:23.892
of course, feel this very strongly. I think 
they're right

22:24.597 --> 22:37.637
that it's one of the wonderful things about human 
beings that they can understand nature, up to a

22:24.597 --> 22:37.637
point at least. And we haven't reached that limit 
yet. I don't want to just put you ahead as fast as we

22:39.900 --> 22:46.210
can to find out as much as we can. Maybe we will find 
eventually one of two things will happen, that

22:46.230 --> 22:53.541
science becomes so complicated If it loses its 
unity and its integrity, therefore people won't

22:54.719 --> 23:02.288
be interested in it. No, it's not necessary. I 
mean, it's quite possible that we could develop a

23:02.888 --> 23:10.277
civilization that couldn't care less about 
knowing about nature. Alternatively, the

23:10.297 --> 23:22.971
possibility is it will come up against barriers in 
our minds or limitations of our own minds and our

23:10.297 --> 23:22.971
own ability to understand. That isn't in sight 
yet, but it may be within the next 100 years. I guess

23:31.794 --> 23:37.163
that science is, you can think of science sort of 
like you think about population. It can't go on

23:37.203 --> 23:38.385
forever. The rate at which we're learning things 
is accelerating. That leads to a discontinuity of

23:43.733 --> 23:49.823
something. An exponential curve is by 
fundamentally an unstable, leads to a

23:54.541 --> 24:01.187
discontinuity.

24:04.230 --> 24:07.353
So it can't go on exponentially. In other words, 
maybe we'll go like this and level off like that.

24:10.576 --> 24:17.563
Maybe we'll go like this and go like

24:10.576 --> 24:17.563
that. One of those two things might happen. Now, I 
have one final question, and you're long

24:32.020 --> 24:38.809
Gosh, I think that's an impossible question to 
answer.

24:38.829 --> 24:42.473
You'd have to ask me that 50 years after I'm dead.

24:51.805 --> 25:01.217
I guess the thing that I feel

24:51.805 --> 25:01.217
proudest of It's not saying it's most important, 
but one that I feel was a high point of my life was

25:02.767 --> 25:12.136
starting the University of California in San 
Diego. You know, that may not turn out very well

25:12.156 --> 25:17.461
after all. Something else may happen, more 
important. But so far, I think it's turned out

25:20.163 --> 25:22.045
pretty well. I mean, that was a great experience, 
and an experience that very few people have. It

25:29.112 --> 25:32.335
couldn't have happened at any other time In 
history, just like it happened, technology and

25:33.817 --> 25:39.608
science were riding high. There was plenty of 
money. People thought there were going to be a lot

25:41.631 --> 25:44.056
of people in California. Everything fitted 
together. We were just awfully lucky. But we

25:48.284 --> 25:48.804
didn't. Because we were lucky, we managed to do 
something that was, in some sense, unique.
