WEBVTT

00:01.347 --> 00:05.452
apparent to the former student's board that we 
just had to raise some money. We were not, we didn't

00:05.733 --> 00:15.105
have much of a staff, so we just had Lonnie Locke and 
the secretary were keeping all the books, and he

00:05.733 --> 00:15.105
was doing the student loans, see? And the 
scholarship work was being done over at the, well

00:16.527 --> 00:26.680
it didn't have a student aid office, heck, it was 
being done up in the No, I guess we were doing

00:27.807 --> 00:31.411
everything there in former students. And then 
when we got a development, when McQuillan moved,

00:33.033 --> 00:39.381
then he took the Opportunity Award scholarships 
with him to the development office. I think there

00:40.182 --> 00:41.844
was a guy named Morgan. I'm a little bit hazy right 
in here as to when McQuillan went.

00:49.120 --> 00:49.280
47. Oh, that's it. In 47, McQuillan, when Dick 
Hervey came, he took the Opportunity Award

00:51.243 --> 00:56.329
Scholarship program and all. He did not take 
student loans. Anyway, there was Dick Hervey in

00:59.373 --> 01:01.336
the secretary. There was a records lady and an 
assistant. And there was Mrs. Shepherd by

01:05.661 --> 01:10.387
herself. And then there was a part-time English 
prof, Elmquist. Aggie was a tabloid printed by the

01:13.631 --> 01:17.997
press, and it was late all the time of the month. And 
then we had three people in the mailroom. And one

01:21.448 --> 01:24.872
was an Aggie wife, and the other two were students. 
And Pinky Downs' desk. Old Pinky. You remember

01:30.059 --> 01:30.619
him? Yeah. Anyway, so. And where was all this 
housed? It was housed in the west end, on the first

01:34.725 --> 01:38.830
floor west end of the MSC. When we remodeled it, and 
we used the back entrance and the mailroom

01:39.811 --> 01:44.457
entrance, was the fire escape and when we had to be 
careful to not clog up that fire escape hall fire

01:44.707 --> 02:07.390
chief and just eat our ass out and say well don't you 
said people couldn't get out of this place you got

01:44.707 --> 02:07.390
to keep that empty don't you can use it yeah right 
but we had we had a crash door thing on it from the

01:44.707 --> 02:07.390
inside and so we can put a glass door on it so you can 
anyway But it became apparent. So they said, what

02:10.155 --> 02:14.962
we need to do is one A&M man ask another one to give. 
We need to have personal solicitation. Well, they

02:16.685 --> 02:19.890
didn't quite know how to get it kicked off. So Dick 
called me and he said, I remember you telling me

02:19.930 --> 02:24.417
that you did United Fund. I said, that's right. I 
was downtown chairman. I was building chairman,

02:26.840 --> 02:32.830
the various chairman of these districts for the 
United Fund. And I had my own company, which was

02:32.890 --> 02:35.774
City Public Service. And we had a lot of employees. 
So I got someone at each power plant and electric

02:37.441 --> 02:40.745
distribution to take cards. And it was pretty easy 
to do. The boss of the company said, I give so much,

02:42.747 --> 02:47.632
I'll expect all employees to give something. 
Ideally, you'd give a certain . Boy, people didn't

02:50.175 --> 02:54.379
like that much to be told they had to give. But they 
did. And so I learned at least organization. Then I

02:59.645 --> 03:02.728
got in on the solicitation of our church. We 
started a new church, Jefferson Methodist

03:02.788 --> 03:05.691
Church. And I was involved in that. program of 
capital giving as well as the annual giving for the

03:07.664 --> 03:14.595
church budget. So being on these fundraising 
committees involved, I had a sense of what I could

03:14.615 --> 03:19.643
do. And so the only breakdown they could give me was 
San Antonio, and they could give me class years,

03:20.324 --> 03:30.720
and that's it. They could give me county. We had 
these tabs. See, we had address graph plates. So we

03:35.795 --> 03:43.783
had a tab up there for giving, a tab up there for 
class year, and a tab up there for county and city.

03:45.085 --> 03:47.147
And so we could break the cards out about like that. 
Oh, yeah, major course of study. No, colleges,

03:48.468 --> 03:54.054
College of Education, Engineering, or Liberal 
Arts, and so on. We had those tabs. We had eight

03:55.255 --> 04:01.161
tabs, I think, across the top of those 
addressograph plates. And it was a pretty

04:01.698 --> 04:04.341
primitive system up to a hair foot. Compared to 
what you can do with a computer. Oh, well, anyway. I

04:07.764 --> 04:11.908
think I've seen that old addressograph machine or 
one like it around here somewhere. Yeah, it makes

04:12.288 --> 04:14.470
me sick. So the fun of it is we knew we had to do 
something about upgrading the whole thing. We

04:18.194 --> 04:20.276
also had to upgrade programs and so on. So what they 
did, they had a good long-range study. And out of

04:24.760 --> 04:28.684
this study came, we had to do personal 
solicitations. We had to. And this study was

04:30.023 --> 04:32.667
within the former students? Within the former 
students, yeah. Long range study. Yeah. Yeah.

04:35.011 --> 04:37.134
It's still, Randy Metz still got it in file over 
there. I hope he's got it Xeroxed and preserved for

04:37.194 --> 04:41.601
prosperity. Anyway, and this, we had to have a 
better publication. We had, well, all this

04:46.468 --> 04:54.060
reflected programs, staff, personal 
solicitation, and all these. This took staff.

04:55.342 --> 04:55.482
Mm-hmm. So obviously we had to do something, 
because at this time I had gone with Sharpen

04:55.698 --> 05:00.645
Company and was traveling all the time. So I had a 
little time that I could figure out this stuff. So

05:04.671 --> 05:07.436
Dick said, why don't I do some experiments? So we 
got together and designed a jacket and a little

05:07.456 --> 05:21.857
envelope to put our workers' cards in and put a 
little campaign material about why we needed the

05:07.456 --> 05:21.857
annual fund, what the projects were, and so on, and 
to give to workers. Dick went ahead and we did an

05:22.478 --> 05:25.020
experiment in 1959. We had it all finished, and he 
sent me the cards on San Antonio for the ones who'd

05:26.301 --> 05:36.451
given and the ones that hadn't given in the last 
year. And I was able to break them down by a major

05:37.291 --> 05:51.304
course of study as far as engineering, 
agriculture, liberal arts, and science, and

05:37.291 --> 05:51.304
medicine, and so on, the various schools, you 
know, that we could tab at a different level, tab in

05:37.291 --> 05:51.304
there. So man, you're working in the San Antonio 
area.

05:57.038 --> 05:59.261
So I devised this system. I said, OK, I'll get the 
lawyers. See, I knew everybody. So I get the

06:04.747 --> 06:16.681
lawyers and the doctors, dentists, insurance 
men, and then my company, Aggies with Public

06:04.747 --> 06:16.681
Service Board, Aggies with Texaco, Shell, and so 
on. Then I had the class agents. I had some class

06:18.383 --> 06:20.025
agents there in town. And I got them. I said, now, 
Henry, you're the class of 16. How about taking

06:25.350 --> 06:26.351
your cards? Oh, you bet. And of course, our motto 
then was not the amount of your gift, but you are the

06:27.693 --> 06:32.501
important gift. See, we wanted a $10 gift. A $25 
gift was cause for celebration. A $5 gift was

06:38.250 --> 06:42.296
common, and a $10 gift was about average. 
Actually, our average. gift at the end of that year

06:43.900 --> 06:45.742
was $12.81. We were shook up and said, we can't do it 
on this. What are we going to do? So I started

06:52.028 --> 06:57.073
traveling around the country, going to these 
American Alumni Council meetings and so on. Wait,

06:57.093 --> 06:59.154
I'm getting ahead of myself. So anyway, it was 
determined that I did this. Boy, listen, our

07:02.197 --> 07:05.761
percentage of participation jumped way up. We 
jumped up to almost 70%, 68% participation. in

07:10.782 --> 07:13.105
giving, but our average gift was $10. That's what 
I'm trying to say. So when we had a board meeting and

07:15.388 --> 07:21.857
I presented what we'd done on this personal 
solicitation, well, that's the way to go. We've

07:22.598 --> 07:23.379
got to get them involved. Then after we get them 
involved, then we'll talk about amount. Let's get

07:26.604 --> 07:27.465
them giving. And after we get them giving, but then 
we've got to have a good publication. We didn't

07:30.669 --> 07:32.371
have that Texas Aggie tabloid. It was terrible. 
And so what are we going to do about that? Well, it's

07:35.836 --> 07:40.182
going to take money, because then you've got to get 
a full-time editor. Carl Elkiss was teaching

07:40.398 --> 07:44.443
regular load in English in the English 
department. So what in the world were we going to

07:44.463 --> 07:45.525
do? Well, we just had to have additional staff. So 
they decided it was going to be me. I didn't know

07:52.995 --> 08:01.446
this, but I guess it was 1960, Earl Rudder and Dick 
Hervey called me up to Bandera. Past presidents

08:01.526 --> 08:02.968
were having a meeting. And here Dick Hervey and 
Earl Rudder take me back in the Purple Sage Motel.

08:10.233 --> 08:28.540
and told me that they wanted me to move to College 
Station to take over the annual giving program, be

08:10.233 --> 08:28.540
the assistant executive director, and be in 
charge of clubs and activities, club activities,

08:10.233 --> 08:28.540
and annual giving. Prepare direct mail pieces. 
which I had a pretty good perspective of because of

08:31.343 --> 08:34.909
the advertising thing that I had. That really 
helped. And I found out about Jim Earl right away

08:36.151 --> 08:40.439
and got him to be my artist. And all he won was, well, 
at the time I got him it was Century Club, so I gave

08:41.100 --> 08:48.052
him the Century Club credit for doing my artwork. 
Who was that? Jim Earl. Jim Earl, yeah. He was a

08:49.815 --> 08:51.357
graduate student at the time. Incidentally, I'm 
going to ask Jim Earl to do a plate. for this revised

08:54.901 --> 08:58.947
book of Cadet Slouch with some kind of cover. I 
thought he was wonderful, too. I hated to see him

09:00.529 --> 09:01.971
go, you know? You don't have to go and pay any 
attention to him anymore. He'd be well to death.

09:05.697 --> 09:06.558
Oh, I liked him. In fact, you let me know what it is. 
I'll take him to lunch or dinner or something and

09:09.683 --> 09:12.247
get him to do it. No, I've already asked. He said 
he'd be delighted to do it. Great. And I asked him to

09:15.752 --> 09:20.278
kind of write me sort of an epilogue about Cadet 
Slouch. Beautiful. Yeah, I think it'll be

09:21.180 --> 09:22.522
amazing. So anyway, I told him, I said, I said, did 
you check my transcript? Earl said, uh-huh. He

09:31.801 --> 09:34.145
said, I won't check yours if you won't check mine. 
Come on, we've taken the same thing

09:35.186 --> 09:39.733
industrialized. So anyway, Earl said, he said, I 
was in his division. I was in the reserve. I was the

09:46.182 --> 09:47.223
lieutenant colonel. I was commanding a 
battalion. I was commanding the armored cavalry

09:49.506 --> 09:53.432
reconnaissance squadron in the 90th infantry 
division. He said, It was a recon outfit, you know,

09:54.453 --> 09:57.916
armored stuff. I got that from Fort Knox when I was 
on the staff instructor up there for a while during

09:57.936 --> 10:03.942
the Korea thing. That's why I didn't go overseas, 
because I stayed in school all the time. I went to

10:06.705 --> 10:08.306
the Air Ground Operations School. I forgot that 
one. Went to the Engineering School. Went to

10:10.829 --> 10:12.590
nothing but school during that time. I bet you the 
Army's got a million dollars in education. I went

10:16.214 --> 10:19.016
to Command General Staff School for a year or so. 
You were a professional soldier there. That's

10:20.278 --> 10:20.958
right, that's right. Exactly. You got it. And I had 
a pretty good rank, you know. So I went home and told

10:25.193 --> 10:27.857
my family. I said, President Rudder and Mr. 
Hervey, Hervey authorized it from the board

10:27.937 --> 10:36.230
because I had the experience. I'd done this. I had 
the track record, and I wasn't even on the staff.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.178
See, I was a volunteer. So that's what got me the job 
right there. So I came back and told the kids. I

10:45.544 --> 10:47.788
said, we're going to move to College Station. And 
I'm going to move. in april next year 61 and y'all

10:51.220 --> 11:19.000
are going to move in september we'll take this time 
to sell a house take me to find a house but uh we'll

10:51.220 --> 11:19.000
move labor day and that'll get you up there and go oh 
i'm not going to leave they started crying and

10:51.220 --> 11:19.000
you're here claire didn't want to leave her 
gorgeous house and all kind of stuff and i said well

10:51.220 --> 11:19.000
it's like moving to the church when we moved over 
when my stepfather gave us this house and i gave him

10:51.220 --> 11:19.000
my house we traded out He sold mine. He couldn't 
sell. This big old house was on San Pedro, Highway

11:20.777 --> 11:23.181
281. Anyway, I said, I'm going to move to College 
Station, and I hope you all will come with me. I

11:29.431 --> 11:30.733
said, if you don't, that's fine. I'll send you rent 
money for a checkup. So during the summer, I

11:33.398 --> 11:36.002
commuted. And I went home every Friday evening, 
and I came back every Sunday evening. That was all

11:43.128 --> 11:46.352
we did, except we did take a trip. We went to a 
convention in Miami, Florida, and Claire went

11:46.392 --> 11:50.858
with us. That's over. She met all these people. I 
was going to ask you about the stress and the

11:52.520 --> 11:54.462
strain. Well, that cost a lot. But anyway, we went 
to Miami, Florida, and we had a ball. We took a trip

12:01.872 --> 12:04.475
to Nassau afterwards and so on. McClellan, six of 
us, in a 61 Oldsmobile, McClellan, Hervey's, and

12:04.996 --> 12:12.325
Weir's in the car. The first thing People were 
smoking. And I said, well, folks, we can't smoke in

12:15.331 --> 12:17.834
this car. One person at a time that cracked the 
window. We made Julia McQuillan the smoke

12:20.318 --> 12:22.240
officer. Smoke control officer. So anyway, so by 
the time the summer was over, Claire and the kids

12:24.764 --> 12:28.409
were up. It's a good thing we did, because they're 
here. They really fit in beautifully. They both

12:31.814 --> 12:33.436
achieved a lot here. They did well. They both 
graduated from college, one Texas and one North

12:35.599 --> 12:40.506
Texas music. So it was a great thing we did. I'm glad 
it worked. But imagine here, I was 40 years old

12:44.462 --> 12:47.265
starting a whole new career. You really had a 
multifaceted career. I didn't realize you'd done

12:50.649 --> 12:52.511
all those things. Just fantastic. And so I learned 
a lot. You are a full-time employee at this point of

12:56.336 --> 13:00.601
the Former Students Association. Your check came 
from the Former Students Association. I wasn't

13:02.844 --> 13:06.628
making quite as much as I was making before, but of 
course that was commissions and I I could have made

13:07.081 --> 13:13.652
twice that much if I'd worked twice that hard when 
you're a salesman. But I was really lucky. I was

13:15.055 --> 13:16.277
lucky I had a good boss. But anyway, I came to work up 
here with more money than McClellan was making. He

13:21.726 --> 13:26.635
went over as director of development, say, in 
1947, when Dick came. Anyway, at that time, we're

13:27.376 --> 13:31.283
still making student loans and doing all this 
stuff. I figured this has got to stop. We've got to

13:33.580 --> 13:37.885
have a full-time, big student financial aid 
office. Well, see, Runner was big on faculty and

13:37.905 --> 13:41.569
scientists. He would pay, and we raised money to 
supplement their salaries until they could get

13:42.250 --> 13:52.201
enough research and whatever else money, 
salaries. We got five or six people. We really,

13:53.523 --> 14:01.472
when he got senior and buyers and all these reals, 
and all those people who were National Academy

13:53.523 --> 14:01.472
people, what do you call them, the Nobel Prize 
winners. Well, they cost a lot of money. And we paid

14:11.245 --> 14:13.607
for the moving expenses. So let's go back in. So I 
came here. And the first thing I did when I got here

14:16.911 --> 14:20.975
was change a whole direct mail appeal. And I had 
some ideas from San Antonio, from advertising. I

14:25.960 --> 14:27.662
was in the advertising club there. So I got a lot of 
my friends in the advertising agency business and

14:28.182 --> 14:33.670
artwork business to give me ideas. Plus, I looked 
at annual giving appeals from other schools,

14:33.750 --> 14:39.359
which I didn't really like because they didn't fit 
Aggies. I tried to fit mine to A&M people. Who did

14:42.323 --> 14:43.085
you look at? Who was doing good in gift raising in 
those days? What universities were you going to?

14:52.617 --> 14:53.778
You have to realize this. Most of the schools, I'd 
say that 99% of all the universities in America,

14:53.978 --> 15:01.365
alumni associations, have dues. Giving, annual 
giving, is done by development. But we didn't have

15:06.631 --> 15:07.832
any development. So we called our annual giving 
the development fund of the former student

15:07.852 --> 15:11.856
association. We had a development foundation 
that Herman Heath and Doc Doherty had set up, but it

15:12.736 --> 15:19.603
was dormant. Until Dorsey McCrory went over to 
that, there wasn't even anybody looking after it,

15:19.853 --> 15:24.019
see? We didn't have anybody moving that. We just 
had an endowment sitting over there. The income

15:27.544 --> 15:30.428
went to the discretion of the former students 
board. We gave it to the university. We just gave it

15:31.970 --> 15:33.452
to the president. It was out of our budget, but we 
gave him the money. Because we had former student

15:38.159 --> 15:40.082
trustees. We appointed the trustees, the former 
students, but we still do, to the development

15:40.402 --> 15:45.129
foundation. That's why we locked together. And 
all that's out of the control of the university,

15:47.478 --> 15:50.521
fiscal. We give them money, but they don't raise 
it. We raise it and give it to them. So I had nothing

15:55.287 --> 16:04.377
to go by on annual giving to alumni association, 
except one, University of Pennsylvania. Is that

16:04.397 --> 16:05.438
right? How did you pick up on them? Well, I'll tell 
you. I went to these annual meetings, and I talked

16:07.701 --> 16:10.544
to everybody. And we had annual giving meetings, 
and we had a dog. The annual giving was always in

16:13.667 --> 16:16.911
development. But Ohio State was pretty close. 
Their alumni and development was together. Well,

16:24.989 --> 16:27.452
their development had a century club. But that 
money did not go to the alumni. Yet they were housed

16:29.274 --> 16:30.916
in the same building. It would be like our 
building, William's building, had half

16:31.677 --> 16:37.223
development on one side and half alumni on the 
other side. And so Kenyon Campbell was the guy of

16:37.323 --> 16:40.206
development. And I can't remember the other guy's 
name. He was with alumni. He was a feisty. Kept them

16:46.237 --> 16:49.240
out of the Rose Bowl and all that kind of stuff. 
Anyway, I couldn't find anybody that had, Texas

16:49.261 --> 17:00.173
Tech and those schools had dues, and University of 
Texas had dues, they had lifetime memberships and

16:49.261 --> 17:00.173
that sort of stuff. So here we would have annual 
giving, but our average gift was about the same as

17:00.193 --> 17:05.199
dues. I knew we had to do something. So I got the idea 
from Ohio State. But that was development. But

17:15.177 --> 17:28.429
then I found, when I went to that meeting up at the 
Big Ten, there was a guy from the University of

17:15.177 --> 17:28.429
Pennsylvania there, and he had what he called the 
Ben Franklin Associates. Other schools I looked

17:28.449 --> 17:36.836
at, Oklahoma or, say, Purdue or all those others, 
if they had like the John Purdue Club, that was all

17:28.449 --> 17:36.836
for football. That was like our hanging club for 12 
men and five. So the John Purdue Club was for

17:39.379 --> 17:43.142
football. $100 a year for football. No priority 
tickets and so on. So at the University of

17:48.617 --> 17:55.445
Pennsylvania, Ben Franks Olsen was annual giving 
to the alumni. Their development went for bigger

17:55.465 --> 17:57.268
stuff than that. But they knew that if their alumni 
were going to function, they had to. So I said,

18:00.632 --> 18:02.534
that's it. So with the Century Club idea from Ohio 
State and the annual giving from the University of

18:02.554 --> 18:10.523
Pennsylvania, I found it. And I came back and I 
prepared. the paper to the board. And we met down at

18:14.787 --> 18:16.950
Tenneco, and I presented it to them. There's a 
century club, $100. And then I said, we should have

18:20.876 --> 18:22.378
other levels. But we didn't quite know what to call 
those things. $250, $500, and $1,000. Well, they

18:27.505 --> 18:31.091
said, first of all, let's go to $100 right now. 
Don't worry about the higher level. They approved

18:32.432 --> 18:32.953
it. Whenever the time comes, go ahead and prove it. 
We didn't know what to call it. I couldn't think of

18:36.768 --> 18:39.992
the names of things like that. I didn't come up with 
the 12th Man Foundation, see. I knew that was a bad

18:43.017 --> 18:45.660
name. I mean the Aggie Club was a bad name. So we came 
up and I presented Century Club certificates. Big

18:55.433 --> 18:58.017
mailing went out to all the people who had given to 
the Anybody who gave to the stadium expansion, we

18:58.199 --> 19:03.246
gave them Century Club credit, see? I said, Royce, 
that's restricted giving. He said, that's right,

19:05.670 --> 19:09.996
but next year, we'll send a little tab along to hang 
on the bottom. Next year, it won't be restricted,

19:10.978 --> 19:12.941
see? And it worked. Over half of them kept giving 
$100, see? So we started out with probably 2,000

19:17.507 --> 19:24.858
people giving $100 a year, just like that. Just 
like that. That's an incredible success. So I was

19:29.033 --> 19:30.817
in power one day. And it tied into the stadium 
expansion. Yeah. In what year? 1955? No, well, it

19:36.949 --> 19:47.150
was when, see, these people bought options in the 
old press box expansion that Bowles Urban did.

19:47.170 --> 19:47.410
Yeah, yeah. And then when we built the deck on it in 
66, 65? Must have been, I bet, 65. Okay, I was trying

19:54.282 --> 19:56.064
to think. Because my plaque says 68, and that's 
when we finished it. I got a plaque in there on my

19:59.970 --> 20:02.233
stadium. We had to do that, too. We didn't have a 
12-month Aggie club or anybody with us to do that.

20:06.720 --> 20:09.063
So here the former students are doing all these 
other damn things. But Weisenbaker said, I'll

20:09.925 --> 20:13.650
tell you about Weisenbaker here in a minute. 
because he's tied into a lot of this stuff, like the

20:14.508 --> 20:18.412
President Scholars and so on. Anyway, so,

20:18.432 --> 20:36.012
I'm sitting in Weisenbaker's office, and we're 
gloating over the success of the Central Club, and

20:18.432 --> 20:36.012
I said, look, what we're doing here is kind of a 
Mickey Mouse printed certificate we're sending

20:18.432 --> 20:36.012
people. And I said, it's not, it doesn't have any 
oomph to it. It doesn't have pizzazz. And I said,

20:40.117 --> 20:42.760
you know, I still had that advertising stuff in me. 
My whole background really fitted me for this job.

20:47.122 --> 20:52.368
It was quite unusual that I learned the United 
Front thing and church thing and advertising. So

20:52.448 --> 20:57.513
anyway, I'm sitting and looking up at the wall, and 
there it was. The YMCA Century Club with a gorgeous

20:58.414 --> 21:08.224
casting

20:58.414 --> 21:08.224
of a boy's head. And when I looked at that, I saw the 
University seal instead of the boy's head. I saw

21:13.239 --> 21:15.323
Century Club written below it. I got one on the wall 
right there, one of the first ones. And so that was

21:19.669 --> 21:22.513
the logo and the billboard there. And I said, 
Royce, can we call that YMCA man here? He said, hey,

21:25.598 --> 21:29.584
sir, call old so-and-so at the YMCA and have him. We 
want to talk to him. So I got him on the phone. I

21:34.225 --> 21:34.866
talked to him. I said, I'm in Mr. Weisenbaker's 
office, and I'm looking at your plaque. And I

21:38.049 --> 21:41.372
noticed on the back of it, it said the Sports Award 
Company of Chicago. Are you still doing business

21:41.392 --> 21:42.573
with them? He said, yeah. How much do these cost? He 
said, $10. I said, OK. $10 a piece? And so I said, oh,

21:48.419 --> 21:53.323
man. And so I said, well, that's fine. Thank you 
very much. I took their address down and

21:57.587 --> 21:59.990
everything else. And phone number. He had the 
phone number, too. I plan to use a similar award, if

22:02.525 --> 22:07.231
I can raise the money, to buy these plaques. 
Because they'll really go over big, I think. And I

22:10.095 --> 22:12.058
said, you don't mind if I? Oh, no. He said, that's 
fine. It's public information. He said, I hope

22:14.401 --> 22:16.504
you're successful. Because I said, he says, they 
won't always say YMCA. So

22:21.051 --> 22:28.140
to see how it'd go, I figured, why don't we buy 1,000 
to start with? And so I said, what in the world are we

22:28.160 --> 22:30.844
going to do? for money, and I said, well, I think 
I'll call executive committee meeting, and then

22:31.718 --> 22:39.989
if I need a board meeting, we'd just have to 
appropriate some money. We're going to have to

22:40.009 --> 22:42.152
find $10,000 somewhere. I think it was $7,500 plus 
the postage, plus the cost of the casting, plus the

22:42.772 --> 22:51.304
artwork and that sort of thing. But you have to make 
ready to produce these plaques. I think we needed

22:56.626 --> 22:59.210
about $10,000 all together. I think the plaques 
really were $750 apiece. That was about right. It

23:02.917 --> 23:06.623
turned out about $10 round figures. Packaging and 
mailing and all that

23:06.643 --> 23:11.952
stuff. issue right old buck a $10,000 check to the 
former students association he said I'm sitting

23:12.893 --> 23:42.411
there and I want to jump across the desk and kiss it I 
want to say I love you you're the greatest man in the

23:12.893 --> 23:42.411
world so see that old fundraisers when something 
like that happens we go all to pieces we want to

23:12.893 --> 23:42.411
shout to the skies and hit the ceiling so she came in 
with a $10,000 check made out to the former

23:12.893 --> 23:42.411
students and I raced back to down here, and we got 
Tom around to do the artwork. He was at the press

23:45.755 --> 23:47.098
then. We didn't get Tom for quite a while. And we did 
the details of what we wanted the plaque to say, the

23:49.161 --> 23:59.337
little plate that's on it, and then the other, the 
year tabs below it. I go ahead, Dave says, I got that

23:59.890 --> 24:06.859
plaque, and I thought to myself, the minute I saw 
those little hooks on the bottom, I said, uh-oh.

24:06.939 --> 24:07.500
Oh, shit. He said, the goddamn virus has got me 
again. That's good. So that's a good story. That

24:14.869 --> 24:19.435
started that, and we nailed those plaques out to 
the... And they first went out wind, you know?

24:20.765 --> 24:22.648
Roughly. 66? 66, yeah. Because we gave anybody 
credit for being a founding member of 65 or 66 if

24:25.933 --> 24:35.066
they gave an either here and the gifts to the 
stadium expansion. Now, this is a $100 gift that's

24:36.208 --> 24:38.872
getting you that plaque. A $100 gift. And anyway, 
here you send the plaque out. We just started

24:44.981 --> 24:47.645
converting to magazine. We really didn't have an 
editor yet. Yeah, we did. We got an editor in 66.

24:53.031 --> 24:56.576
Well, see, as soon as the money started coming in, I 
could hire somebody. See, there's no state money.

24:57.778 --> 25:00.762
We're sitting over there having to use that gift 
money as everything we get. And boy, that's why it

25:01.963 --> 25:08.773
took me a while to get our personnel classified as 
the same as state. For example, I had to get my

25:08.793 --> 25:11.236
people classified somehow. And we didn't have 
benefits equal to the state or anything. So it took

25:15.262 --> 25:16.323
me a while to get. So finally, when Juanita Murray 
came after Lonnie Locke retired, We got everybody

25:19.979 --> 25:25.465
in the place classified according to the state pay 
scale. Personnel gave me all the state

25:25.945 --> 25:30.450
classifications for various editors and 
accountants and secretaries. And we were able to

25:30.470 --> 25:34.134
classify every one of our people the same as the 
university. And with the experience, we had the

25:34.434 --> 25:39.239
steps, the step one, two, four, or something like 
that. I should know this, but is the Former

25:39.279 --> 25:44.885
Students Association is chartered or organized 
as what? As a philanthropic or? Philanthropic

25:46.787 --> 25:49.530
Edomocenary Association classified The charter 
is under the Secretary of State, State of Texas,

25:49.915 --> 25:55.102
99-year thing. When was that charter? I know when 
the former singers began and all that stuff, but

25:57.685 --> 26:03.693
the charter really was probably written? It's in 
John Adams' book or something. Back in the 30s,

26:08.399 --> 26:11.523
20s, maybe 21? Yeah, that sounds about right. 21, 
100-year charter, 99-year charter, Secretary of

26:12.965 --> 26:18.252
State. And then in 1940, 41, we've got one of the 
first March of Dimes, 501C3 philanthropic

26:18.502 --> 26:28.976
organization. See, the March of Dimes charter was 
the first one under Roosevelt. When would that be,

26:35.105 --> 26:37.088
1940, 39? Yeah, right in there. So we had a guy named 
Ted Moley, and he got the— Former students were one

26:45.181 --> 26:58.979
of the first ones that got that tax-exempt, 
philanthropic, all those words they use in their

26:45.181 --> 26:58.979
letter from IRS, which you have to renew every so 
many years. You have to apply for a new. Then we got

27:01.983 --> 27:05.328
one, see, we got one for the for the Aggie Club. And 
we had one for the Development Foundation. We had

27:08.452 --> 27:14.580
all three of those were chartered by the state and 
by the federal government as charitable.

27:15.235 --> 27:18.398
organizations for the 501 tax code. So that's the 
beginning, really, of your successful

27:19.179 --> 27:25.106
fundraising is the Century Club plaque. Right. 
That plaque did it. See, we took pictures of it. We

27:28.930 --> 27:30.671
had pictures of it in the magazine. We had pictures 
of it everywhere. See, my first full-time editor

27:32.473 --> 27:35.016
was Joe Buser. And Joe Buser had just come back from 
the service. I think I got him in 67.

27:41.999 --> 27:46.765
Elnquist tried a large, oversized, and we took the 
tabloid and tried to make a magazine out of it. It

27:46.785 --> 27:47.586
didn't work too well. We had to get a full-time 
editor, and we had to go commercial so we could get

27:47.927 --> 27:54.696
time set, and a printing done, and a commercial 
operation to get it out on time. And in the press, we

27:54.716 --> 27:57.039
had a low priority. That's when I was convinced the 
way we were treated by different agencies on the

27:57.319 --> 28:10.757
campus, putting off, well, we'll do that 
tomorrow, you know, the inefficiencies of it, no

27:57.319 --> 28:10.757
motivational sense of purpose or no sense of 
urgency. And I said, well, we've got to

28:11.125 --> 28:14.108
computerize. We'll do it with data processing, 
but we're going to control the records. The

28:19.212 --> 28:21.775
university will not control these records. He 
said, how could I ever get a mailing list? I'd have

28:24.517 --> 28:28.201
to go on low priority, like these other schools, 
like LSU. I got them off of the statement. So that

28:30.042 --> 28:30.943
was their hang-up. Well, almost all these 
schools, SMU, all these alumni associations.

28:34.927 --> 28:38.210
Well, they start out because they think it saves 
them money, and it ends up throttling them. The

28:38.230 --> 28:39.411
University of Texas. They have their own record 
system, but the university pays them for keeping

28:39.661 --> 28:45.691
the addresses of alumni. Our registrar actually 
can get money to keep alumni records, but our

28:45.952 --> 28:51.561
people won't. Our formal student payers are just 
so viciously independent. They don't want to

28:55.708 --> 28:57.291
depend on the university. Are you chilly? No, I'm 
fine. Thank you. I can turn it. And we got a lot, I

29:02.763 --> 29:05.387
didn't realize we had so much to say. And I wonder 
where you are. I'll come back if you get tired. So,

29:09.353 --> 29:10.715
the Century Club. Then, when Bob Latimer was 
president a couple years later, I can't remember

29:11.416 --> 29:26.560
the year, I've got it, we're in his house and after 
the second martini, maybe it was while we were

29:11.416 --> 29:26.560
drinking the second martini, I said, Bob, One 
thing we've got to do this year, his company had

29:27.620 --> 29:34.850
been sold and he was kept on salary, good big salary 
for a year. And so he was present for it and all he did

29:36.192 --> 29:48.328
then was get invested in the magazine and I had to 
fire an editor and hire, I think I had to fire a guy

29:36.192 --> 29:48.328
and I hired, I guess that's when we hired Jerry 
Cooper. And I said we've got to get this upper

29:49.450 --> 29:53.435
level, Central Club going better. I said we've got 
to identify and give a name to these levels. And I

29:57.438 --> 29:58.840
said, well what can we do? We were talking about the 
cum laude level, and I said well I was going to tie it

29:58.860 --> 30:03.648
in with academia, you know. And little old Jane 
Lyons says, well why don't you just call it like

30:04.369 --> 30:12.783
precious metals, like gold and silver and brass 
and so on. And I said, oh that's great, okay, it'll

30:13.364 --> 30:22.078
be silver for $250 and it'll be $500 for the golden 
for the $500, and then what in the world are we going

30:22.733 --> 30:27.639
to call that top one, the $1,000? She said, oh, 
that's easy. Call that the diamond. I said, God,

30:30.643 --> 30:34.649
gee, you're just wonderful. So she's the one that 
made the... So then we kicked that off in good

30:37.352 --> 30:40.877
shape, and boy, it was really successful. So now 
they got the double diamond. Now they got them

30:42.839 --> 30:44.922
endowed, see, and everything. Then we started 
being able to get staff. Then I could hire a field

30:48.887 --> 30:50.850
director, and I hired... an associate. That's 
when I got Bob Walker as a developer. But see, what

30:55.143 --> 30:56.325
happened there? Let me tell you what happened to 
Bob Walker. Instead of him coming and taking over

30:59.109 --> 31:08.121
my job as field and all the other kind of stuff, we 
had kicked off the presidency. The board of

31:08.161 --> 31:14.610
directors in 1966,

31:08.161 --> 31:14.610
we'll say, or 7, authorized the President's 
Scholars Program. That was gifts. Yeah, I

31:18.155 --> 31:19.336
remember that. We had to get gifts, or the Board of 
Regents had to appropriate the money for these

31:19.597 --> 31:25.725
President's Scholars. We were trying to get the 
Brady kids, you know. And I don't know how many we

31:27.808 --> 31:31.032
had, not many, probably 10. So the former students 
had worked with the Regents, and so we were pledged

31:31.833 --> 31:40.185
to fund so many, too. So the Regents funded some, 
and we funded the rest. I think we were funding

31:43.469 --> 31:44.631
about, I think there probably were 20 or 25 
altogether. We were funding half each. And then

31:49.877 --> 31:55.262
Wisemaker came up with the idea, shit, let's endow 
these. $25,000 endowment. They got together and

31:57.684 --> 31:59.946
worked out the interest rates and so on. And the 
Board of Regents, and we said, give us permission

32:00.646 --> 32:04.850
to go and work these endowments, and we'll get 
going. Well, I got the artwork done. I got the

32:07.853 --> 32:14.078
letter written to Rudder and all the stuff, a real 
fancy package to send to people to get this $25,000

32:07.853 --> 32:14.078
gift. And I took it down to Earl Runner, and he said, 
oh, he said, I don't know. He said, I think, he said,

32:21.381 --> 32:25.827
let me think this over. He said, I'm, he said, with 
people giving that kind of money, I'm gonna end up

32:26.227 --> 32:32.256
with another board of directors. I'm gonna have, 
and I said, well, President, I don't think so at

32:32.336 --> 32:35.720
all. I think you, he said, well, it's something, he 
said, how many of these you think you'll raise? I

32:41.028 --> 32:45.634
said, I think we'll raise 1,000 of them, 500 at 
least anyway in the next 10 years. He said, 500

32:46.981 --> 32:48.442
students. He said, that's going to be a big job. And 
I said, sure. It's going to take a staff of people to

32:51.385 --> 32:59.554
handle the records, because we want to identify 
each endowment and scholar for that person. So he

33:00.615 --> 33:03.898
said, well, let me think about this. So I called 
Royston. I said, Royston, things not going well. I

33:07.562 --> 33:08.903
need the big guns to come. And he said, well, get me 
an appointment. So I called him back and said, we

33:10.605 --> 33:13.528
got an appointment Tuesday. at 1 o'clock in the 
afternoon Tuesday. So Royce came in, and we

33:16.454 --> 33:19.098
planned our strategy. So we went back to see him, 
and I had a little more work done. I had his letter

33:22.623 --> 33:24.647
finished and some things like this. And Royce laid 
a check on the desk. The Earl Rudder Scholar put a

33:28.813 --> 33:31.658
check for $25,000. And Royce said, oh, yeah. He 
said, OK. He said, I agree to the program, but I

33:36.686 --> 33:40.312
think that Dorsey ought to run it. And Royce says. 
You think that he will do it? And the writer says,

33:43.862 --> 33:46.824
well, sure, I'm going to tell him to do it. So I 
bundled up this stuff. I had a sizable package of

33:49.447 --> 33:59.336
papers and cardboard and stuff like that, logos 
and things for the P.E.S. See, now, this is outside

33:59.356 --> 34:01.739
of alumni work. This is development. So I take this 
whole thing over to Dorsey, and I leave it with him.

34:06.243 --> 34:08.805
I said, Dorsey, read all this material. And the 
problem is that Earl Rudder, I mean, President

34:08.825 --> 34:11.528
Rudder, wants you to, to administer this program. 
And I said, now, Dorsey, I'm going further. I've

34:17.206 --> 34:18.609
got a staff plan here. Initially, you'll need one 
secretary and one assistant man to deal with

34:19.690 --> 34:27.322
contact to these people. And I said, I will help 
him. I said, right here is the prospect list. I had

34:34.954 --> 34:36.757
200 people on here. I guarantee you, every one of 
them came right through. Within two years, all

34:40.752 --> 34:44.576
those 200 had given them down. Now, where is 
Dorsey? That's the question I wanted to ask. He's

34:46.979 --> 34:47.680
in development now. He was the director of 
development after he became President Rudder's

34:47.700 --> 34:50.804
assistant. And McQuillan retired. They looked 
for a replacement. In fact, guys came down here

34:54.268 --> 34:57.592
from Missouri and from Michigan. And they studied 
everybody on campus. They recommended Dorsey

34:59.374 --> 35:01.596
McCrory be director of development. And old 
Dorsey was lazy. And I knew he wasn't going to do it.

35:07.283 --> 35:09.966
But I had his staff organization. to support the 
program. Initially, he needed one secretary and

35:11.430 --> 35:15.375
one person to go out and solicit these. And the 
director of development now is under Rudder's

35:15.475 --> 35:18.960
direct authority. Yes, sir. Which I understand. 
Rudder is involved. See, if we're going to have

35:24.188 --> 35:30.857
millions of dollars in endowments for these 
present scholarships, endowed scholarships,

35:24.188 --> 35:30.857
then Rudder wanted to control them. Right. That's 
what he was obviously removing. Which he's right.

35:36.782 --> 35:38.324
See, he's absolutely right. I couldn't agree 
more. That money had no business being over.

35:41.648 --> 35:45.032
That's restricted, endowed money, and ought to be 
administered by the state. At least the

35:45.252 --> 35:53.722
foundation, which is controlled by the 
association, but still he can control that

35:45.252 --> 35:53.722
through the foundation. Because his employees 
run the foundation. So

35:57.348 --> 36:11.791
two weeks later, in a campus mail, I get all this 
material I left with Dorsey in it with a note

35:57.348 --> 36:11.791
saying, thanks for your staff suggestions. I 
don't have the space to set up an office for this. We

36:18.202 --> 36:22.989
don't have the staff to budget and so on and so on. 
Because I even gave him a budget. How much his

36:25.377 --> 36:31.042
travel would cost, how much his publication would 
cost, transportation, all the other stuff to go.

36:35.927 --> 36:38.249
So anyway, we get it back. Meanwhile, I'm out in San 
Francisco, and I hire, I don't hire, I see Bob

36:40.351 --> 36:53.443
Walker, who was Aggie class of 58, who was director 
of development and annual giving and editor of the

36:53.643 --> 36:58.930
He was everything in the Alumni Association at 
Pepperdine University in Los Angeles. So I said,

36:58.950 --> 37:01.273
what are you doing out here? Why don't you come back 
to Texas? And he said, I'd like to. I said, I'm

37:05.318 --> 37:09.583
looking for a man right now as director of annual 
giving. And I said, I'm about to have a new program.

37:14.529 --> 37:15.531
I actually need two men. Two men.

37:22.516 --> 37:26.440
But I only had money for one. So I said, you going to 
the conference in Miami this year? And he said,

37:30.265 --> 37:30.885
yeah. I said, why don't you stop in Houston, which 
was only about six weeks or two months away, and

37:30.906 --> 37:43.360
stop in Houston for an interview with Melvin 
Waltz, who was our president at that time. And I'll

37:44.661 --> 37:46.123
have executive committee there. I'll be there 
myself. And let me know your flight schedule. I'll

37:48.425 --> 37:50.768
meet you at the plane. You need to be interviewed 
because this is, in our scope, this is my

37:51.592 --> 37:57.298
assistant. You'll be my associate executive 
director. And you'll have to carry

38:00.601 --> 38:12.373
on a multiplicity of programs, annual giving and 
PES and all that stuff. Well, anyway, see

38:12.393 --> 38:17.278
meanwhile, I'm still doing city campaigns. I was 
just mailing cards out to my chairman. I had funds

38:22.442 --> 38:25.966
to hire a full-time secretary in Fort Worth, 
Dallas. You were the staff, basically, right now.

38:28.269 --> 38:32.113
I was the whole staff, that's right. But I was doing 
that by mail. I had a full-time. So these got

38:34.276 --> 38:35.858
chairmen, voluntary chairmen. They'd get their 
wife or some other person that's full-time. We'd

38:38.702 --> 38:41.545
put a phone in their home or wherever it is they 
wanted to do it. And they ran the annual giving. But

38:43.390 --> 38:45.772
as I said, our level was coming up. And finally, I 
dropped annual giving and just had them solicit

38:45.852 --> 38:49.557
for Century Club. Because we had to quit thinking 
about $10 gifts. $25 enough is what we needed. We

38:56.365 --> 38:58.707
couldn't run that association on less than that. 
Our average gift had to be somewhere in the

38:58.948 --> 39:04.975
vicinity of at least $26, $27, about our average. 
So the Century Club was going great guns. By this

39:10.465 --> 39:13.088
time, we were heavy in the plaque business. So 
anyway, Bob Walker was hired then after the

39:13.928 --> 39:17.872
interview in Houston. So when he came, meanwhile, 
I had everything finished except the brochure.

39:25.040 --> 39:29.164
And we had a guy who was on the board named Don 
Garrett from San Antonio. He was vice president

39:29.184 --> 39:34.549
and soon to be president of Frost National Bank, 
Aggie. Passed with 15, 55, 56. And he... helped us

39:40.148 --> 39:42.932
as a businessman. He was receiving a letter from 
Rudder and getting this brochure. And his

39:46.877 --> 39:50.202
advertising agency helped us with the brochure 
and so on. Cecil Stewart did a logo for us that

39:51.123 --> 39:56.610
worked out real nice, PES logo. So anyway, it 
turned out that that was going to be a full-time

39:56.630 --> 40:01.137
job. So Bob Walker, in effect, took the 
President's Endowed Scholarship Program over.

40:08.448 --> 40:12.732
We just let the city campaign sort of fizzle out, 
went into direct mail. And I got him to take over the

40:13.153 --> 40:19.399
direct mail annual giving. But actually, most of 
his time went into the PES. Because $25,000 in

40:24.485 --> 40:28.509
those days was a lot of money. We had to make several 
calls. And we were having other people recommend.

40:32.814 --> 40:36.177
Once we'd get Harold done, he'd get his buddies to 
give. So we were using centers of influence to help

40:36.595 --> 40:40.379
us raising these endowments. So basically, 
though, what Rutter had projected didn't work

40:40.419 --> 40:43.683
out. No, it didn't work out at all. The development 
fund shifted back to the former students. Former

40:47.848 --> 40:48.849
students, yeah. Did that create any rub or 
problems in the future with the administration?

40:55.116 --> 41:00.903
Or did the administrators feel like you were in 
control, in fact, of something there? No, it

41:00.923 --> 41:02.685
didn't cause any control. I've never heard of any 
idea. Except when Jack Williams came, two or three

41:05.114 --> 41:09.940
things happened. And we were riding back from 
Dallas, and I had made some notes, and Jack

41:11.422 --> 41:19.213
Williams says, what are the things that we're 
doing? He made me go with him everywhere. Because

41:21.576 --> 41:24.540
he wanted me to tell you where the former students 
were. I said, this is Henry Deloff Clash and so and

41:24.790 --> 41:28.915
so and so and so. He's a great historian. He's a 
people person. He wanted everybody there. He's a

41:32.920 --> 41:34.302
people person. I tell you, here's a great story. He 
wanted me to go the first time to Austin. And Bob

41:39.989 --> 41:41.370
Cherry. Yeah, Bob Cherry was there. Yeah, Bob 
Cherry was there. But Williams didn't know Cherry

41:46.697 --> 41:48.339
too well. He wanted me to go with him. appropriate, 
Bob was there. Bob was secretary of the board at the

41:53.772 --> 41:55.995
time. And several of our deans and several of 
everybody else. See, I had to go over with Rudder

41:59.320 --> 42:14.920
when the co-education thing was hot to read the 
resolution by the Association Board of Council on

41:59.320 --> 42:14.920
encouraging the Regents to reconsider the 
admission of women and the Non-Compulsory Court.

42:14.940 --> 42:17.644
So I was a little bit familiar with those 
committees over there. So we're at this committee

42:17.704 --> 42:19.907
and this guy's Dr. Williams, before we get on with 
the Appropriations Committee hearing here, tell

42:20.225 --> 42:30.285
us what is meant by hullabaloo, connect, connect? 
And Dr. Williams said, and didn't bat an eye or

42:31.193 --> 42:37.839
write smack, and he said, in Chickasha, India, 
that means beat the hell out of the University of

42:31.193 --> 42:37.839
Texas. He was good. He was quick. They fell on the 
floor. He was quick. They fell on the floor. The

42:45.105 --> 42:46.987
meeting was really in chaos. Everybody was 
laughing. Anyway, the man from Midland said,

42:49.949 --> 42:53.873
thank you very much, sir. We'll continue with the 
hearing. I've always wondered what that meant. He

42:58.737 --> 42:59.918
went to Texas Tech. So

42:59.898 --> 43:09.971
when Williams came, I said, well, number one, he 
said, do you have a Friends in the library? I said,

43:09.991 --> 43:10.491
no. But I said, we sure need one. The library was 
just neglected. Everybody neglects it. So

43:14.216 --> 43:18.401
Williams said, well, let me work on that. I said, I 
think we need to do that. Of course, that got me

43:20.424 --> 43:21.745
involved in it. So I've been involved in it ever 
since and became president of the Friends a couple

43:21.805 --> 43:27.272
of years after that. I said, the big thing is we have 
a disaster in the development area, just

43:28.703 --> 43:36.552
absolutely nothing. I said, we have a foundation 
with approximately $250,000 in it given by

43:36.612 --> 43:50.607
probably three people, Wofford Cain and Herman 
Heap and Doc Doherty and a few people like that. I

43:51.308 --> 43:58.035
said, we need a director of development and later a 
vice president and so on. I said, we sure do need to

43:58.285 --> 43:59.928
go. She said, well, why hadn't this been done? I 
said, well, we were spread too thin. And I said,

44:05.897 --> 44:09.483
Earl Rudder wasn't willing to push it at the time. 
He needed more emphasis on faculty and staff. And

44:14.150 --> 44:17.055
his problems, that was not one of his problems. It 
was on low priority. That's all I'm saying. So he

44:21.061 --> 44:24.867
said, well. We'll talk about that. Said, get 
someone lined up for me to interview. And he said,

44:28.503 --> 44:31.506
what about budget? I said, well, the university's 
going to have to come up with a budget, because this

44:31.566 --> 44:36.290
man will have to be a university employee. 
Wouldn't you like it? And he says, well, I said, I

44:37.532 --> 44:42.076
don't think that this money ought to be in the 
former student association. I think this ought to

44:42.176 --> 44:44.598
be in the Development Foundation, at least. So 
anyway, we recruited at meetings, and we had

44:46.981 --> 44:52.626
people come in here. It cost us a lot of money just 
paying these people to come in for interviews. A

44:56.122 --> 44:57.684
lot of them paid their own expenses. But we tried 
for about three months and we couldn't get

44:58.725 --> 45:01.548
anywhere. So finally he said to me, why don't you 
take it? I said well I haven't finished, I've got to

45:04.812 --> 45:08.016
finish this job. I've got to get a better magazine 
and I've got to, you know. So William asked you to

45:15.590 --> 45:17.773
take it up? Yeah. I said, you know, I'd be a younger 
man. I said, Bob Walker's familiar with

45:20.896 --> 45:22.438
everything. He's well-trained. He's been doing 
it out in California for Pepperdine. I said, he's,

45:27.324 --> 45:34.753
of course, the truth is he wasn't very good at 
annual giving either. I said, I didn't tell him

45:34.873 --> 45:36.556
that. I just said, he's attuned. He's a 
people-on-people man, and he really works with

45:38.518 --> 45:42.323
old people well. He's a good man for trust and 
requests and so on. I said, he can hire a lawyer. I

45:47.240 --> 45:52.145
said, but I said, he'll be, and I said, he's working 
on his doctorate right now. I said, I've given him

45:52.285 --> 46:00.354
time to, because I think that whoever fills his job 
ought to have the credentials for a vice

45:52.285 --> 46:00.354
president. Shouldn't be a bachelor's or 
master's. You know, he just, if you're going to be

46:02.257 --> 46:06.582
involved in education, just have those 
credentials. Whereas I don't, for what I'm doing,

46:06.882 --> 46:09.685
a bachelor's is fine. I don't need anything like 
that. But if you're rubbing elbows with the vice

46:13.589 --> 46:19.235
presidents and deans and people like that, you 
need to have it. It looks good on paper, too. So he

46:21.637 --> 46:24.721
said, well, let me think about that. So he said, 
okay, on Walker, let's talk about how we do this and

46:24.741 --> 46:31.348
so on. So

46:31.608 --> 46:40.257
when was that now, roughly, that Bob Walker was 
hired? Let's see. I can dig it out, but no. Let's

46:43.559 --> 46:46.001
see.

46:50.445 --> 46:53.227
I wonder if Jerry, do you ever keep up with this? 
Yeah.

46:56.390 --> 47:00.013
I'm glad you turned that out, too, because I can go 
back. See, 67 was the President's Scholars

47:00.073 --> 47:07.660
Program sponsored by Texas A&M University System 
Board of Directors and the Association of Former

47:00.073 --> 47:07.660
Students, 67. OK, now let's go over here and see 
when Rudder.
