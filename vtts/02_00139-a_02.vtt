WEBVTT

00:03.035 --> 00:07.066
You tell me, you guide me, what you need me to say. 
One of the things I was interested in was

00:07.928 --> 00:18.597
using electrophoretic techniques for purifying 
proteans.

00:19.640 --> 00:23.645
Fortunately, he was the person to talk to, and I 
didn't know that at the time. I just, you know, I

00:24.146 --> 00:34.380
would be in the hall or see him in the hall, and he'd 
be, he quite often visited with his students, his

00:24.146 --> 00:34.380
own students, as well as other faculty. And I don't 
know, maybe he spent more time for his students

00:34.420 --> 00:41.389
than other people, because he was, I believe he was 
department head at the time. I think so. But he was

00:43.197 --> 00:55.671
very frequently in the hall, and so I had the 
occasion to visit with him on several occasions

00:43.197 --> 00:55.671
on, you know, using, applying electrophoretic 
techniques. Now you had, so you're taking a full

00:56.552 --> 01:00.016
load. Yes. But you're also teaching, working full 
time. Well, that's part of the responsibility.

01:08.685 --> 01:10.167
But yeah, yeah, oh yeah. And when would those 
instructional duties begin for you? Those would

01:14.786 --> 01:21.396
be at least two times a week, two full afternoons a 
week. You're saying four hours? Mm-hmm. And how

01:23.579 --> 01:29.267
much preparation time did each lab session 
require for you all? Well, quite often we'd

01:29.287 --> 01:35.476
prepare about an hour or so before the exam. I mean, 
not before the exam, before the exam. and

01:39.914 --> 02:08.807
fortunately you see if we had not known pretty well 
if we hadn't had the laboratory experience that we

01:39.914 --> 02:08.807
had had that would have been chaos that would have 
been but we knew pretty well I mean we need this we

01:39.914 --> 02:08.807
need this blood auger we need this kind of media we 
need this kind of media and we're going to be

01:39.914 --> 02:08.807
talking about E. coli today so we don't need the 
blood auger but we need some EMB and we need the

01:39.914 --> 02:08.807
nutrient auger and we're going to need these 
various biochemicals and we had even at that time

02:09.142 --> 02:34.440
we had a pretty good support staff so we could say 
look we're going to need before this afternoon or

02:09.142 --> 02:34.440
before before next Thursday afternoon we're 
going to need this for this many students and

02:09.142 --> 02:34.440
that's about you know and how would you describe 
the facilities in veterinary medicine at that

02:09.142 --> 02:34.440
time in comparison now uh See, I had been 
accustomed to state of the art, I mean, with the

02:35.703 --> 02:44.756
Army, state of the art laboratory facilities. And 
they were very good facilities. They stacked up

02:47.000 --> 02:49.083
very well with that. They stacked up much better 
than, for example, the facilities at the

02:49.263 --> 03:04.005
University of Texas, the microbiology 
facilities at the University of Texas, and

02:49.263 --> 03:04.005
certainly better than the facilities that they 
had at Southwest Texas. They were not comparable

03:04.559 --> 03:10.109
to what the Army had because, you know, they had an 
unlimited budget. But they,

03:10.890 --> 03:26.938
somebody, and I guess it was Leland, had the 
foresight to hire these ladies from Caldwell and

03:10.890 --> 03:26.938
the surrounding community who were committed to 
wanting to do a good job And they generally did

03:27.526 --> 03:30.990
exactly as they were told. And I mean, you know, 
they followed instructions very well. And what

03:34.474 --> 03:35.335
was their task? Making media and helping in the 
preparation, you know, setting up things for the

03:36.376 --> 03:43.284
labs and so forth. Now during your first 
semesters, first year or so, do you remember any

03:43.445 --> 03:55.879
unusual goof ups for you or anybody else where you 
all learned by experience or something went

03:43.445 --> 03:55.879
wrong? Something didn't work? Oh, I'm trying to 
think of some. Yeah, there were several.

04:07.636 --> 04:15.446
Well,

04:07.636 --> 04:15.446
misidentifying, I mean, using some things for the 
wrong thing.

04:19.511 --> 04:24.077
Yeah, there's a group of organisms called 
Clostridia. that produce a lot of gas and if you if

04:24.648 --> 04:53.018
you put in a lot of sugar in the media and

04:24.648 --> 04:53.018
you try to stopper the media those you inoculate 
the media and at various times during the day those

04:24.648 --> 04:53.018
you shouldn't be using stoppered media to begin 
with with Clostridia and that sort of thing But we

04:53.302 --> 05:02.177
got the media mixed up, and during the class you'd 
see these stoppers popping off because of the

04:53.302 --> 05:02.177
amount of gas that was being produced by those 
things. Oh, I'm hard-pressed to think of any...

05:07.706 --> 05:10.791
Nothing exploded, nothing caught fire? Well, 
yes, as a matter of fact, we almost had a disaster at

05:10.811 --> 05:16.120
one time. now you can't use things like ether you 
know very readily but another individual I don't

05:17.129 --> 05:43.626
know that I should mention his name because he 
later became a department head in another

05:17.129 --> 05:43.626
department but he was a graduate student at that 
time too and he was working he was in another

05:17.129 --> 05:43.626
department but he was working in our area and he's 
working with ether And ether has a tendency, you

05:45.007 --> 05:56.198
know, it's heavier than air so it tends to go along 
the floor and the vapors go along the floor. And one

05:56.598 --> 06:04.405
of these individuals, Paul Youngerman, was a 
heavy smoker and of course at that time you could

05:56.598 --> 06:04.405
smoke anywhere. And he was smoking one time and 
this

06:05.907 --> 06:13.714
individual who who was working with the ether, he 
was trying to do some lipid extraction. At that

06:18.554 --> 06:22.420
time you used ether to extract lipids. And so he was 
trying to extract some things and he wasn't using a

06:23.161 --> 06:26.306
fume hood. Fume hoods were rarely used at that time 
too. So the ether vapors went along and here was

06:30.412 --> 06:39.145
Paul Youngerman and he flipped off some ashes on 
the floor. Fortunately, that's all it did, but it

06:40.863 --> 06:47.812
could have caused a very serious problem.

06:50.275 --> 06:55.201
How much did you see in your first semesters of the 
Dean of Veterinary Medicine? Didn't see him at

06:56.362 --> 06:57.343
all. He didn't come around to instruct you? No, 
I'll tell you, no, he didn't. When did you first

07:01.509 --> 07:06.735
meet him? Actually,

07:07.475 --> 07:15.683
Al Price was the dean that was there when I was there 
as a graduate student. I used to, I was kind of a

07:17.604 --> 07:31.758
glutton for punishment, I guess, because I was 
kind of interested in, I didn't want to take a

07:17.604 --> 07:31.758
course in histology, but I was kind of interested 
in the subject because I, frankly, had plans.

07:33.539 --> 07:37.363
After I kind of got the

07:39.082 --> 07:43.187
I had plans ultimately of going back after getting 
my Ph.D. to go back to medical school. I never did do

07:43.448 --> 07:46.852
that, but I sort of had plans to. But I was kind of 
interested in histology, and that was Al Price's

07:47.313 --> 07:52.480
field. He was another one of those stellar 
individuals.

08:01.137 --> 08:10.653
There are several people who probably weren't 
nationally known or internationally known, but I

08:01.137 --> 08:10.653
think that they're, I have had lectures. As an 
undergraduate at the University of Texas, I had

08:11.214 --> 08:21.512
taken classes with a painter whom perhaps you 
know. Theophilus. Theophilus, right. He was a

08:24.577 --> 08:29.023
stellar, he was an outstanding lecturer. And so, 
my point of reference is that there were a number of

08:30.304 --> 08:40.017
people like this that I had the good fortune to know 
and participate in their classes. And while Al and

08:42.020 --> 08:53.014
some of the others that I'm gonna mention in just a 
moment didn't have the national and

08:42.020 --> 08:53.014
international name, they were very good. very 
good people too, Al Price, R.D. Turk, who was a

08:59.286 --> 09:01.809
parasitologist. A character from the word go, 
sort of like Paul Youngerman. Paul Youngerman was

09:07.095 --> 09:08.797
a character too. Archie Flowers was a pretty good 
man too. And then I'd put Mac Prescott in that same

09:14.243 --> 09:17.146
league. Did you ever have a course with Dean Price? 
No, I didn't. He let me set in on his course, and he

09:22.426 --> 09:27.474
was very good at it. I mean, very good lecturer. So 
he was teaching, still teaching course while he

09:28.555 --> 09:31.660
was leaving? Sure. Oh, you bet. You bet. Yeah. Now, 
he was nicknamed a long time before you got here as

09:34.745 --> 09:39.412
Slick Al. That's right. And I presume that meant 
that when he finished the product, It was well

09:45.863 --> 09:47.827
polished. Well, he was kind of a politician 
himself. He had a good way with words. But it was not

09:55.361 --> 09:59.489
meant that he was going to put something off on 
somebody. No, that's true. He was very...

10:06.974 --> 10:10.158
very decisive, very forceful. You know, he 
explained when he, and he was kind of strict on a

10:11.339 --> 10:20.409
code of conduct, too. Oh, what was the code of 
conduct? Well, you were to wear ties at all times.

10:29.579 --> 10:33.083
You were to wear, not to wear boots. you were to have 
a completely professional demeanor, students

10:34.784 --> 10:40.471
and faculty. And in fact, I

10:41.412 --> 10:50.103
believe his title was Assistant Dean McMurray. 
Did you know him or know of him? He was an individual

10:55.209 --> 11:03.660
that tried to buck, maybe I shouldn't be, don't 
use, I mean, use your own discretion. McMurray was

11:04.332 --> 11:32.331
the kind of individual that he really kind of he 
kind of wanted to be Dean himself but he didn't have

11:04.332 --> 11:32.331
the he didn't really didn't have the hoot spot to be 
but he kind of bucked Al quite a bit Al was always

11:04.332 --> 11:32.331
very neatly dressed and he spoke very well he I 
doubt that I don't know where I don't imagine Al

11:04.332 --> 11:32.331
ever said damn or anything like that he was very But

11:33.273 --> 11:42.810
McMurray almost got fired one time because he 
started wearing boots. He did the other things,

11:44.433 --> 11:45.956
you know. He wore jackets and that sort of thing, 
but he wanted to wear boots. And I think it almost

11:50.504 --> 11:53.610
fired him over that incident. Because he was very, 
Al was very. How long was it after you got here that

11:56.980 --> 12:06.790
you decided very definitely that you would get a 
PhD here whether you went to medical school or not?

12:06.830 --> 12:08.452
How long did it take you to make that decision? I was 
pretty well, financially, I was doing better than

12:09.273 --> 12:15.179
I'd ever done in my life as a student. So, I mean, I, 
you know, we, I grew up very poor, Carol and I both

12:19.949 --> 12:22.794
were very poor. So we felt, I mean, we were very 
comfortable even as students here, but Carol was

12:22.874 --> 12:30.105
still working pretty hard too. Let's see, your 
question was, how long did it take me to decide? I

12:33.911 --> 12:37.477
decided almost right away that that's what I 
wanted to do, is get a PhD. Now, my dad asked me,

12:37.537 --> 12:46.952
son,

12:37.537 --> 12:46.952
you're getting a PhD in what? And I said, 
veterinary microbiology. I thought you was gonna

12:49.855 --> 12:53.501
be a doctor. Well, I'm not sure. Well, we sure 
thought you were gonna be a doctor, a PhD in what

12:56.846 --> 13:01.673
again? I said, veterinary microbiology. Are you 
gonna be a veterinarian? I don't think so, Dan.

13:11.428 --> 13:15.775
Well, what the hell does a veterinary 
microbiologist do if he's not a veterinarian? I

13:17.425 --> 13:20.957
had a conversation very much like that too. What 
can you do with a degree in history? What can you

13:24.649 --> 13:26.575
make? A direct answer to your question. I knew 
right away that that's what I wanted to do. I was

13:35.320 --> 13:37.243
working on a problem that I was interested in. I was 
in an environment that was, to me, very

13:37.283 --> 13:41.049
stimulating. And how long did it take you to 
identify what you were going to do as your research

13:41.069 --> 13:48.681
topic?

13:49.471 --> 13:50.793
After the first semester. Okay, and describe it. 
Okay, yeah, well, yeah, yeah, it's, in fact, it's

13:54.279 --> 14:06.320
something that I, the subject is equine 
infectious anemia. Okay, equine infectious

14:07.081 --> 14:08.864
anemia. I knew nothing, know nothing about 
horses. Mm-hmm. Infectious anemia is a disease

14:13.670 --> 14:21.538
that at that time was ravaging the racehorses of 
the country. Well, that didn't bother me. I mean, I

14:22.979 --> 14:26.002
wasn't high on, right? But it was a problem that 
they didn't really know what the etiology was.

14:31.348 --> 14:43.660
They weren't real sure whether it was a virus or 
whether it was a PPLO-like, they called them

14:31.348 --> 14:43.660
PPLO-like organisms at that time, or whether it 
was a toxin. And so this was really a challenge to me

14:45.800 --> 14:55.090
that I really thought, I felt like it was, and the 
guy that I worked with felt like that it was a virus.

14:56.131 --> 14:59.575
And I had happened to have had some experience in 
cell culture methodology. You've gotta have

14:59.615 --> 15:07.303
grow, in order to cultivate and study viruses, 
you've gotta have cell culture systems. So I knew

15:07.363 --> 15:13.410
right away then that that's, Did someone suggest 
it to you, or did you come up with the idea? No, no one

15:18.362 --> 15:30.040
suggested it to me, but a fellow by the name of Wayne 
Moore, I don't know if you have heard of him or know

15:18.362 --> 15:30.040
of him, knew of him or anything. Wayne was one of 
these guys, real bright guys, but he was on the

15:31.081 --> 15:35.348
faculty.

15:37.992 --> 15:41.457
But he was pursuing a number of, disease animal 
disease problems and and one of them was equine

15:42.753 --> 16:05.487
infectious anemia and I told him that I asked you 
know I got to quizzing him about that about that

15:42.753 --> 16:05.487
situation he said you know it's a strange thing Don 
said we've got this old Appaloosa's horse over

15:42.753 --> 16:05.487
here that has never shown any signs of it But if we 
take blood out of that horse and inject it into

16:07.036 --> 16:17.372
another horse, the horse will come down with the 
disease 14 days later. The unique thing about that

16:18.133 --> 16:32.875
disease, still kind of an interesting disease, 
the unique thing about that disease is that the

16:18.133 --> 16:32.875
affected animal goes through a very structured 
cyclical pattern. Each 14 days they go into fever

16:33.496 --> 16:39.925
and then they'll clear up and be normal and then 
they'll go into this. Well, so I was intrigued by

16:41.507 --> 16:46.594
the idea of being able to. Who ended up being your 
chairman? Leland. Leland Grumbles. Mm-hm.

16:52.783 --> 16:55.587
Although Wayne directed my work. And you all had 
agreed upon this as your topic within the first

16:56.188 --> 17:01.235
year? Yeah. Mm-hm. right now meanwhile let's go to 
personal life describe you and wife and Donald a

17:03.162 --> 17:32.832
youngster describe y'all getting a place to live 
oh listen yeah well I was when we how did you find a

17:03.162 --> 17:32.832
place well again this is one this is personal I mean 
this is the kind of story that may not be of any

17:03.162 --> 17:32.832
interest to you but it's I have been lucky uh in a 
number of ways throughout my life and we um You

17:34.583 --> 17:47.681
know, after I decided to come here, after we had 
decided to come here, Carol and I had decided to

17:34.583 --> 17:47.681
come here, we didn't know for sure where we were 
gonna live because married student housing was

17:34.583 --> 17:47.681
full at that time. I had decided I was gonna come 
here, but I didn't know where I was gonna live and

17:49.203 --> 17:58.135
knew nothing about, and really, housing was kinda 
scarce even at that time. And again, I happened to

18:00.599 --> 18:03.763
be in the post office. there in the college station 
where the university post office is still there.

18:08.534 --> 18:08.734
Northgate. Northgate, right. And there's a 
fellow there by the name of Sam B. Pate.

18:18.325 --> 18:19.286
He's still around. And I was talking with Gordon, I 
believe, or somebody else in the post office, and

18:20.788 --> 18:32.822
he overheard me saying this, talking about the 
plight that I was in, and And he said, young man, I

18:33.427 --> 18:39.353
might can help you out with that situation. So we, 
again, to make a long story short, we moved out

18:39.493 --> 18:43.176
there. He had a place that was out north of Bryan on 
Highway 21, sort of in the country, and just

18:43.196 --> 18:51.505
perfect. Carol just loved that place. And so we 
moved there and we stayed there for the duration of

18:54.167 --> 18:57.951
my graduate studies. Do you remember what the rent 
was?

19:03.110 --> 19:05.533
I think it was $50 a month or something like that. 
Just really, hardly anything. But the Pates were

19:09.880 --> 19:15.968
just marvelous people. They treated us like we 
were their children. And in fact,

19:20.374 --> 19:30.028
Donald, my oldest son, was a child at that time, and 
then we were expecting a second child. And the

19:30.869 --> 19:38.038
house that we lived in, it was just a one-bedroom 
house, a small place that Mr. Pate, Sam B. Pate, had

19:39.140 --> 19:46.009
built for his son and wife to live while they were 
going to school. And so it was just ideal for us. And

19:48.712 --> 19:50.494
we told him that we was going to have to move. And he 
said, look, I'll be happy to sell that house to you.

19:56.162 --> 19:57.643
And I said, well, Mr. Pate, I just can't afford it. 
He said... You won't believe how much I said, well,

20:01.193 --> 20:08.883
really, and the real reason why we couldn't do that 
was because our flat family was growing, so we

20:01.193 --> 20:08.883
moved away. Well, the paint place, CMB Paint, 
about two years after we moved off of the place.

20:20.419 --> 20:22.141
Now, see, he was offering to sell it to us. About two 
years after we moved off the place.

20:28.690 --> 20:28.990
Right. Oil was discovered. Oil was discovered and 
Mr. Pate, that property was all worth a lot of

20:31.611 --> 20:36.696
money. So we moved over on Villa Maria and there we 
had kiddos and John and then ultimately moved

20:38.839 --> 20:47.729
here. Did you buy a house or rent? No, we bought a 
house. Bought a house. Bought a house. what was it

20:51.937 --> 20:58.265
like for the two of you and your youngster to become 
part of the community? How did you all make

20:58.325 --> 20:59.507
friends? Well, the Pates were just marvelous 
people. As I say, we had been so lucky throughout

21:06.316 --> 21:18.231
all of our, I mean, you know, we've, it's just, I 
don't know, we've just been real lucky with just

21:06.316 --> 21:18.231
about everything. into the Bryan area, for a long 
time we were recognized as students. And students

21:25.697 --> 21:29.363
were sort of, I mean, particularly the merchants. 
The students,

21:29.383 --> 21:34.771
the air base had just closed. And so there was a lot 
of negative feelings about the air base personnel

21:35.672 --> 21:46.648
and a lot of negative feelings about the

21:35.672 --> 21:46.648
student personnel.

21:48.198 --> 22:12.467
it it really didn't impact us all that much except 
that people weren't as friendly as we thought they

21:48.198 --> 22:12.467
should be

21:48.198 --> 22:12.467
but if you were part of the old Bryan community I 
mean there was a vast difference it's it's kind of

21:48.198 --> 22:12.467
strange how a community seems like a community 
develops a personality like a person individual

21:48.198 --> 22:12.467
you know like an individual had a community has a 
personality But once we became part of the, you

22:13.240 --> 22:22.971
know, recognized as part of the community, this 
has always been just the friendliest community.

22:23.111 --> 22:25.254
And the same is true here in College Station. Now, 
we became acquainted with y'all, of course, at

22:25.274 --> 22:29.198
church. Now, did y'all come to the First 
Presbyterian Church in Bryan soon after you

22:29.719 --> 22:34.324
arrived? Well, not too long. No, we were here about 
a year before we... We became members of the First

22:43.413 --> 22:46.858
Presbyterian Church. We were looking around for 
churches. Neither one of us had been very active in

22:48.860 --> 22:53.086
church prior to that time. We were looking for a 
church in which our kiddos could be comfortable

22:54.608 --> 23:01.798
and grow up, Donald and John. And we felt like that 
if we were going to do that, we... Well, the First

23:03.480 --> 23:12.913
Presbyterian Church, we attended... I grew up in 
the Church of Christ, I might add. And so we went to

23:17.769 --> 23:28.244
the Church of Christ and of course that was, now 
don't tell JD this because, erase this part, don't

23:17.769 --> 23:28.244
ever show this to JD, because he is Church of 
Christ. But Hellfire and Brimstone and all that

23:29.026 --> 23:35.616
kind of stuff, no musical accompaniment, you know 
the story. Anyway, we became members of the, we

23:36.257 --> 23:41.905
explored the, First Presbyterian Church, number 
one, because their music program, and number two,

23:42.458 --> 23:49.929
because it looked like they were going to have a 
pretty good youth program. Now, the minister at

23:51.912 --> 23:56.359
the time y'all came, was it Dick Thomas? Dick 
Thomas, Dick Thomas. And so we became acquainted

23:59.483 --> 24:08.958
first with the Porterfields, Peg and Clyde 
Porterfield, and then later with the Heilers. And

24:09.919 --> 24:11.301
so the three of us, I forgot whether it's Clyde and 
Peg or whether it was the Hilers invited us to

24:12.817 --> 24:27.353
become, they asked us if we wanted to be, because we 
had a pretty good background in youth care and that

24:12.817 --> 24:27.353
sort of thing. Dick came out to see us one night, he 
said, well Don and Carol, we'd love to have you as

24:27.373 --> 24:40.107
members, we'd love to have you as youth advisors, 
but if you're gonna be youth advisors, you've got

24:27.373 --> 24:40.107
to be members of this church. And so we, and I 
enjoyed the music. I was very impressed with the

24:45.768 --> 24:48.311
music program there. So we then became members of 
the church and became fairly active in the church.

24:52.936 --> 24:55.379
Now, how long before you got into the choir was 
that? Oh, almost immediately. Oh, okay. Because I

24:57.802 --> 25:01.126
went by the choir one night. We were living not too 
far from there on Villa Maria. And I went by the

25:06.913 --> 25:08.575
choir one night and I, just just walked in you know I 
didn't I hadn't said I was coming or talked to any of

25:09.331 --> 25:33.925
them and I said I just walked in as they were 
beginning to rehearse and I said to I

25:09.331 --> 25:33.925
was wondering I've been impressed with the choir 
and I was wondering if I could be a member of it and it

25:09.331 --> 25:33.925
just chaos when I you know as I walked in and so 
that's just sort of a spontaneous thing Frank

25:09.331 --> 25:33.925
Coulter was the director. Frank Coulter was the 
director and who was the organist then? the lady

25:39.115 --> 25:44.560
whose husband was an entomologist. I can't think 
either right now. But Fern Hammond. Fern Hammond,

25:49.806 --> 25:50.706
yes. And the congregation, the worship services 
were held in what is now the recreation, the

25:51.888 --> 26:01.557
Fellowship Hall. No, it had just, I mean... Oh, it 
just moved to the... It had just moved. I mean,

26:07.583 --> 26:08.464
within... Within a month or so after we became, you 
know, after we joined there. And it just moved over

26:14.630 --> 26:16.192
there. All right. Now let's go back to you. How long 
in your laboratory instructor duties were those

26:18.995 --> 26:32.652
spring and fall, or was it 12 months of the year that 
you had labs to teach? No, it was spring and fall.

26:34.334 --> 26:36.176
And, in fact, I just did that for one year. Okay. And 
then what did you do? After that I got involved in

26:38.245 --> 26:40.290
research. You didn't have a faculty appointment 
that second year? No, I didn't have a faculty

26:45.243 --> 26:50.337
appointment until I finished. So you were then on 
someone's research budget? On the research

26:54.698 --> 26:59.829
budget, no, I was on what was referred to as a Gant. 
Okay, all right. I don't know, I guess they still

27:02.134 --> 27:05.562
use that terminology. And whose project were you 
working on? Actually, Wayne Moore's.

27:13.683 --> 27:43.251
as well as I got to do a lot of interesting you know it 
was just the world was just really exciting to me I

27:13.683 --> 27:43.251
could I became a workaholic and I guess I 
maintained those those characteristics I spent a

27:13.683 --> 27:43.251
lot of time another person I don't know if you knew 
him or know of him his name was he's an electron

27:13.683 --> 27:43.251
microscopist Hugh Grant Whitehouse

27:13.683 --> 27:43.251
he was a strange mix.

27:50.403 --> 27:52.766
He was apparently a very bright individual. He had 
been with the Manhattan Project during the Second

27:52.786 --> 27:58.113
World War. But he was director of the electron 
microscopy center. And because I had the theory

28:03.199 --> 28:11.128
that we were dealing, see the etiology of the 
disease wasn't truly known at that time. And so I

28:11.767 --> 28:17.656
was really anxious to try to get some specimens and 
look at them under the electron microscope. So I

28:17.676 --> 28:24.727
cultivated his, tried to cultivate his, and did 
cultivate his friendship to use the electron

28:17.676 --> 28:24.727
microscope. And so I spent between the time of, I 
mean, I spent most of my, the remaining years, I

28:25.087 --> 28:36.084
mean, I spent one year in the teaching, sort of in 
the instructional mode. Well, part of my duties

28:38.328 --> 28:40.491
too were, There was a glitch in funding for one 
semester, but I mean, I never suffered from that.

28:48.431 --> 29:04.420
But the

28:48.431 --> 29:04.420
department had the responsibility at that time 
for salmonella pallorum testing of turkeys and

28:48.431 --> 29:04.420
chickens and that sort of thing, which meant that 
they would bring in birds from various flocks and

29:05.210 --> 29:33.698
they had to be cultured they had to be tested 
serologically and then they had to be cultured for

29:05.210 --> 29:33.698
the presence of those particular agents and so 
part of my responsibility was to was to culture for

29:05.210 --> 29:33.698
those but you know do that testing and much

29:05.210 --> 29:33.698
of that work was done by by Gordon and myself and 
Gordon had been doing that all the time and then

29:33.965 --> 29:47.922
they got overwhelmed with it and there was a glitch 
in my funding and so they just shifted me over to

29:33.965 --> 29:47.922
that project for about, you know, for a semester or 
so. Right, so after that first year when you were

29:48.443 --> 29:57.895
teaching and had laboratory responsibilities, 
then you were a full-time researcher. That's

29:58.395 --> 30:00.057
correct. And so you're there eight to ten hours a 
day. More. Okay, five days a week or six? Well,

30:06.525 --> 30:15.440
officially five days a week, but in actuality I was 
there seven days a week because I was really

30:06.525 --> 30:15.440
interested in what I was trying to do. And what kind 
of laboratory facility were you provided? Well, I

30:20.528 --> 30:26.398
had two or three homes in which I could work. One of 
them was out in what is now identified as

30:27.509 --> 30:32.437
Veterinary Research Park. There were some old 
buildings out there, and I could say, Dr. Moore, I

30:32.457 --> 30:46.960
need a column, and I need to set this column up, and I 
need this electrophoretic equipment. You ready?

30:49.403 --> 30:49.804
Get it. And so we essentially set up a laboratory 
for protean purification, cell culture, and that

30:50.847 --> 31:07.141
sort of thing, which again was sort of, you know,

30:50.847 --> 31:07.141
it was state of the art, but it was sort of, you know, 
we sort of put it together. And so what I would be

31:08.803 --> 31:15.229
doing would be developing cell cultures. First, I 
was picking up, as horses were...
