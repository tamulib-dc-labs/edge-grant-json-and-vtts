I'll put it where it goes later and says you'll have 
to come on. He backed up in the front of. of

00:08.789 --> 00:33.531
scarborough's you know it steps up at that time it 
it's had a step up of about six or eight inches

00:08.789 --> 00:33.531
before you went into the door down to the sidewalk 
which was lower which was much slower and um it was a

00:08.789 --> 00:33.531
very rough sidewalk there it wasn't smooth like it 
is like it was later on they did great improvement

00:08.789 --> 00:33.531
there but it was rough In other words, it was part 
rock and part cement and just anything to keep you

00:34.439 --> 00:41.452
off of the mud. That's really what it was. And he sat 
down and he took these shoes off. And he put them

00:46.701 --> 00:50.067
over his shoulder and James Ely took his off. He 
said, these shoes are killing me. He said, if we're

00:52.732 --> 00:57.240
going to walk to that wagon yard, he said, these 
shoes are killing me. Well, that was a sin in this

00:57.507 --> 01:00.890
community for years. Papa Blackton told it about 
the two boys sitting down pulling their shoes off.

01:08.057 --> 01:09.418
My shoes are killing me. I'm going to the wagon 
yard. And that was a sin. That was a colloquialism

01:15.604 --> 01:20.068
that no one else but knew why they'd say that. But 
that really happened. And you can just think of an

01:23.011 --> 01:26.434
old country boy coming to town never wearing any 
shoes at all, and buying a pair of patent leather

01:27.190 --> 01:38.563
shoes on a hot summer day in Texas and walking on 
pavement. It wasn't pavement, but concrete. You

01:40.785 --> 01:44.789
can understand why he said, I'm taking these 
things off. They're just killing me. Oh, yeah.

01:48.634 --> 01:49.374
That's great. Now, to me, that's things that 
really happen. And then Well, it is a fact that our

01:58.038 --> 02:11.234
children today know more than we do because 
they've had a better opportunity. Come right in!

02:14.238 --> 02:18.143
That we have had to learn, but they know less. How 
are you, sweetheart? They know less about human

02:21.507 --> 02:25.632
relations to one another. Yeah, they've been 
robbed of that. They've been robbed of it. Yeah,

02:29.260 --> 02:30.661
that's true. They haven't been brought up with 
that closeness to one another like we were. I've

02:37.728 --> 02:45.655
had so many people ask me, well, why are you so 
protective of Lyndon? I said, for the simple

02:45.795 --> 02:53.442
reason I was the oldest girl in the Johnson family 
of any of the grandchildren. Tom Martin was the

02:54.518 --> 02:58.904
oldest boy, and he was 12 years older than I. There 
was not too much feeling there. But I was taught to

03:03.650 --> 03:11.960
guard over every one of my little cousins and to 
take care of them. And I said, I'd slip off and go get

03:11.980 --> 03:18.028
Leonard, because he was always ready to go. And 
always ready to do. And I was always ready to help

03:21.148 --> 03:26.174
and to do. And honest to goodness, that's very 
true. And we were so much alike in that drive to get

03:29.398 --> 03:35.005
going and do things. And that's the reason that we 
were always so close and did so many things

03:35.866 --> 03:46.718
together.

03:46.778 --> 03:47.239
OK.
