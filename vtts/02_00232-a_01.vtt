00:01.195 --> 00:06.980
First, 1985, this is an interview with Norman Borlaug.

00:08.001 --> 00:08.842
This is a test.

00:08.862 --> 00:10.463
This is a test.

00:10.483 --> 00:10.984
Testing.

00:11.144 --> 00:12.946
This is an interview with Norman Borlaug.

00:21.073 --> 00:24.276
Made an analysis of nutritional value, then?

00:24.456 --> 00:26.198
This was done theoretically.

00:26.318 --> 00:30.882
Dr. Ryan of Icarusat.

00:31.807 --> 00:56.160
The International Institute in Hyderabad made an analysis and he found out that the total amount of protein produced per acre or hectare from the increased wheat yields when they were cultivated as they should have been was greater than the total amount of protein produced by the old two systems.

00:57.440 --> 01:15.617
And that if per capita consumption went up of wheat, which has happened up to a certain point, this more than compensated for the displacement of pulses.

01:15.985 --> 01:18.288
point on this is an entirely different one.

01:18.909 --> 01:23.114
I say don't punish the fast runners.

01:23.895 --> 01:26.278
Criticize the ones that are lagging behind.

01:26.638 --> 01:31.164
Get the research people to hell working on grain, legumes, and pulses.

01:32.065 --> 01:38.533
Don't handicap the people on wheat and rice that have done their job and have shown what's possible.

01:38.750 --> 01:44.677
This is just a nice manipulation of words so that you have something to criticize.

01:45.438 --> 02:07.626
But it's become increasingly also, more and more apparent in the last 10 years, that although there's some truth, well, there's not some truth, you have to have a certain level of protein in your diet, and it has to have a certain

02:07.994 --> 02:34.423
balance of the essential amino acids that you can balance better by mixing in your diet, the grain legume and cereal, that now it's more and more clear that undernutrition, lack of enough calories overrides the protein per se.

02:34.673 --> 02:47.010
It used to be thought even 15 years ago, 10 or 15 years ago, that many of the children, especially, were in such bad shape because of low protein intake.

02:47.891 --> 02:54.540
But now the pendulum has swung the other way in nutrition, and they say, first of all, you've got to have enough calories.

02:55.381 --> 03:02.250
And if there's enough calories going in, only rarely do you find the protein malnutrition.

03:02.602 --> 03:15.055
It's there under certain conditions, and especially with very young children, because they don't have enough stomach capacity to take in enough so that they can balance their diets.

03:15.515 --> 03:17.778
You know, the amino acids are a curious thing.

03:18.238 --> 03:26.947
Are you familiar with the old barrel of different heights of staves that Liebig used to illustrate his law of the minimum?

03:28.789 --> 03:30.010
The law of the minimum

03:30.344 --> 03:55.035
was used to refer to what fertilizer or what nutrient was most limiting in yield, and he used to, when he opened up this whole field back in the 1840s, he used this term, the law of the minimum, and a barrel with staves cut at different levels.

03:55.535 --> 03:56.757
The one that was

03:57.361 --> 04:06.451
At the lowest level, no matter how much more nitrogen you put in, it all ran out at the height of that lower stave.

04:06.571 --> 04:11.857
If that happened to be potash, you were wasting the additional nitrogen.

04:12.398 --> 04:17.583
It so happens that our body works this way with essential amino acids.

04:21.508 --> 04:26.473
Our body maintenance and growth

04:27.331 --> 04:42.329
will be determined by the limitation of the least essential amino acid and the others that come in from other proteins will be sloughed off in the urine and the excreta.

04:43.731 --> 04:55.465
So what you're saying here is if the nutriment value is less, that's not even important.

04:56.356 --> 05:04.221
There may be cases with the very young where it is important, but the volume is the overriding thing in most places.

05:04.542 --> 05:07.632
There isn't enough calories in the diet.

05:08.253 --> 05:10.155
and reasonable levels of protein.

05:10.496 --> 05:26.614
If you get enough calories, eat enough weight, or the new corns especially, this will be a big improvement in corn, because corn basically had lower nutritional value than wheat or than rice.

05:30.098 --> 05:33.282
Let's go to another criticism, and some of these other criticisms

05:33.785 --> 05:37.629
deal more with the social structure of developing country.

05:37.809 --> 05:40.371
I'm sure that you've heard these before.

05:40.511 --> 05:45.797
A guy by the name of Lester Brown has written some books, including Seeds of Change.

05:45.877 --> 05:51.322
And Keith Griffin has written The Political Economy of Agricultural Change, an essay on the Green Revolution.

05:52.083 --> 06:02.813
And these people come up with issues like what happened once you introduced these grains.

06:03.113 --> 06:22.419
One of them is that the government supported, were supported, the governments of these countries were supported by wealthier farmers and that the government's concentrated on helping the larger, wealthier farmers with the new technology to continue developing the Green Revolution and not the poorer farmers.

06:22.519 --> 06:24.902
And the result, of course, of that is people who

06:25.304 --> 06:36.078
who were the smaller farmers couldn't compete with the larger farmers, the people who were the tenants ran off the land, some of the small farmers went under.

06:36.718 --> 06:37.940
How would you respond to those?

06:38.320 --> 06:41.144
Well, I think that this is a gross oversimplification.

06:42.245 --> 06:46.671
For example, it's true in any society, U.S.,

06:47.647 --> 06:53.295
that the innovators are generally the most, the best trained.

06:53.856 --> 07:10.619
And if they see those new wheat varieties that are doing better in any kind of a government that has any part of the free enterprise system, they're likely to get a disproportionate early advantage.

07:11.861 --> 07:15.105
But wheat is a crop that...

07:16.233 --> 07:33.374
And as a result, I saw some outlandish prices for wheat, not after the big imports, but those early ones, like when we brought in these small samples, or even the year when we brought in the 300 tons with the bad germination and everything wrong.

07:34.035 --> 07:39.242
Hell, this was being siphoned off into black markets after the harvest.

07:39.642 --> 07:42.886
We had no control off it.

07:42.906 --> 07:44.468
But even if they paid,

07:45.477 --> 07:58.569
and outlined each price, the little farmer maybe bought a kilo, and the next year he planted it in his own plot, and the second year he had enough for his whole damn farm.

07:58.589 --> 08:04.014
So maybe they lagged behind one or two years, but they got the benefits.

08:04.034 --> 08:14.623
From the standpoint of fertilizer, one of the things that we argued and screamed about was credit for the fertilizer and to get the quantities up, to saturate the damn market.

08:15.295 --> 08:40.037
and uh there's no those people that criticize like that what the hell have they ever done they've never been in the trenches they don't know how impossible it is to distribute things except with a pencil when you're out with hunger and misery and dealing with millions of people this

08:40.810 --> 08:49.217
I detest these points of view because they have never lived what they are preaching.

08:49.889 --> 09:03.174
I've been stupid enough to believe the so-called Green Revolution was to cure all of the social, economic, and political ills from the time of Adam and Eve up to 1967 or 68.

09:03.355 --> 09:05.479
I would have been insane.

09:06.501 --> 09:11.290
Apparently some of those people were naive enough to think that this was about to happen.

09:12.316 --> 09:20.290
Actually, it was for self advancement and self promotion within their own field that they liked to write these learned articles.

09:20.913 --> 09:22.680
That was for advancement

09:23.504 --> 09:25.147
within their own field.

09:25.167 --> 09:26.449
But what about their criticism?

09:26.529 --> 09:30.635
I mean, I understand very, very well your position.

09:31.056 --> 09:32.398
But what about the criticism?

09:32.498 --> 09:45.398
And I understand also not only your position, but the fact that you were powerless to stop almost all of the social aspects of being a scientist.

09:45.538 --> 09:46.339
And a foreigner.

09:51.736 --> 09:52.517
that they raised.

09:53.138 --> 10:11.525
The fact that the more educated farmers accept the change first, they're usually the wealthier farmers, they prosper, and then because they're producing more, prices go down and the poor farmer can't make it.

10:11.565 --> 10:14.370
He's no better off economically than he was before.

10:14.410 --> 10:16.573
That didn't happen.

10:18.075 --> 10:20.038
Because the deficit was so big

10:22.212 --> 10:26.638
That by the second and at the latest, the third year, everybody had the seed.

10:28.782 --> 10:29.543
Everybody had it.

10:31.225 --> 10:37.574
You mean the deficit and the amount of grain that they needed was so large that prices didn't go down.

10:37.775 --> 10:41.079
You couldn't saturate the market for quite a few years.

10:42.061 --> 10:49.772
And you need to remember this, that most of the change in production

10:51.119 --> 10:58.129
was the result of the increase in yield on those two to five hectare farms.

10:58.710 --> 11:07.383
That constitutes the great majority of the land ownership in India.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.066
In Pakistan, it's different.

11:09.086 --> 11:13.752
They have got too many big farmers still.

11:13.772 --> 11:20.923
But in India, now, I'm not saying that there aren't some cover-up jobs where a guy that's

11:21.359 --> 11:27.425
presumably got his own 20 hectares or 28, I guess, is the maximum amount of irrigated land.

11:27.946 --> 11:34.453
Might not have a bunch of nephews or so on that's working on another plot, but he controls it.

11:35.053 --> 11:39.118
But I can't waste my energies looking at that.

11:39.658 --> 11:45.144
But the point is this, that where did most of that production come from?

11:46.405 --> 11:47.907
It came from the little plots.

11:49.135 --> 11:56.226
In other words, the vast majority of the people were participating in the main wheat region.

11:56.646 --> 12:02.836
Now, the disparities came from this, and that's an act of God, not of man.

12:04.659 --> 12:12.931
The areas with better rainfall or with irrigation in the best wheat-growing areas jumped their production like this.

12:13.412 --> 12:17.438
These people out in the marginal deserts, they couldn't.

12:18.937 --> 12:21.901
But those are disparities that were there from the beginning.

12:22.763 --> 12:30.494
And to try to blame this onto the... So did the people... Yeah, I agree.

12:30.514 --> 12:36.783
And the same is true for other crops that were stagnant, like these pulses.

12:37.184 --> 12:41.931
And they shifted part of their area to wheat or to rice because it gave them more income.

12:44.415 --> 12:46.598
If the oil seeds didn't move,

12:47.287 --> 12:52.504
If somebody didn't do the research and the extension on the oil seeds,

12:53.665 --> 12:54.927
You've got to start someplace.

12:54.947 --> 12:58.091
You try to start on all the crops and you fail miserably.

12:58.471 --> 12:59.653
You've got to make a breakthrough.

13:00.233 --> 13:02.336
And then you start to point fingers.

13:02.516 --> 13:08.323
Then you're in a position to be heard by the political leaders and by the directors of research.

13:08.363 --> 13:11.307
You'll say, what in the hell is wrong with that mustard program?

13:11.708 --> 13:16.994
It's got everything except one integrator that doesn't have the guts to put the pieces together.

13:17.915 --> 13:19.217
All you need to do

13:19.535 --> 13:37.799
is to do a little better research on finding out when to apply one or at the most two treatments of insecticide to cut back on the damage of aphids and you will increase your production of mustard oil three or fourfold.

13:37.819 --> 13:38.700
They still haven't done it.

13:40.502 --> 13:42.284
But you can't move all of those things.

13:42.685 --> 13:43.987
Do you understand what I mean?

13:44.007 --> 13:44.327
Yes, yes.

13:44.813 --> 13:51.002
Well, what about... And so the best I could ever do was to show what the hell you can do on wheat.

13:51.282 --> 13:53.505
And then the same thing started to come on rice.

13:54.427 --> 14:00.055
And then many of the farmers became wheat and rice, two in the same rotation for the same year.

14:00.776 --> 14:12.272
One of the other things, the biggest indirect benefits that came when we introduced wheat, the new technology of wheat production, let's say in the Punjab,

14:13.298 --> 14:22.730
and in certain other areas, Arianna and Delhi State and Western UP, the farmer would see the response to fertilizer.

14:22.750 --> 14:27.656
If the research hadn't been done on fertilizer for other crops, he'd say, oh my God, look what that did.

14:28.037 --> 14:41.314
So he'll start fertilizing, maybe inefficiently, but this opens the door and you can stick the guy in the stomach that's supposed to be doing the fertilizer on other crops because that farmer's already starting to fertilize.

14:41.767 --> 14:44.412
And it starts a whole series of reactions.

14:45.614 --> 15:06.390
And so probably the double cropping on the same land, which was not possible before you began to use fertilizer, because the farmer had learned long ago that water was not the limiting factor, and he had to leave that land rest in fallow, weed fallow.

15:07.265 --> 15:12.031
from the time he harvested his weeds until he planted the next November and December.

15:13.453 --> 15:25.890
They used to call it leave at rest, fallow, so that there would be some liberation of nitrates by the decomposition of straw and roots and these sorts of things.

15:27.272 --> 15:29.094
So you've got to move it all together.

15:29.314 --> 15:35.803
Now, just to show you that there are scoundrels around and

15:36.627 --> 15:50.908
For example, I suppose in 68 or 69 probably, the early weeks we introduced were semi-dwarf and one of them was a double dwarf, shorter.

15:50.928 --> 15:53.472
But we were experimenting with some very short ones.

15:53.532 --> 15:55.075
We called them triple dwarfs.

15:55.756 --> 16:03.327
They looked very good on the experiment station in Delhi and UP and Ludhiana and Punjab.

16:04.758 --> 16:07.622
But I wasn't convinced that they didn't have problems.

16:07.702 --> 16:12.189
And I said to Anderson, let's get him onto two or three farms.

16:13.551 --> 16:25.749
Well, so they put not just that very short one, but some of the other most promising ones in little plots on the farmer's field where they rented the land.

16:25.769 --> 16:33.921
Of course, you always have to put watchmen out there as these

16:34.222 --> 16:40.688
approach getting ripe, both from the standpoint of animals, but also thievery.

16:42.170 --> 16:57.305
And apparently that very short one, you know, the dwarf wheats with all of the change in yields created just tremendous enthusiasm.

16:57.325 --> 17:00.128
When the wheat was about ripe,

17:00.243 --> 17:12.869
They came out one day and they found, in the morning, they found a guard tied up to a tree and somebody had taken all his clothes off and tied them up to a tree and cut that whole damn plot and carried it off in the night.

17:14.914 --> 17:16.617
Fortunately, it didn't.

17:16.637 --> 17:19.804
It wasn't as good as the taller ones.

17:20.105 --> 17:23.212
because of weed control, but this shows how these things go.

17:23.773 --> 17:26.298
This shows the psychology of change.

17:26.859 --> 17:33.012
And this demonstrates also the difference between being a hands-on scientist and one in an air-conditioned office.

17:33.032 --> 17:33.473
Damn right.

17:35.444 --> 17:36.105
Let's get to this.

17:36.125 --> 17:37.246
Where are the other criticisms?

17:37.266 --> 17:38.468
Okay, we're going to get to those.

17:38.868 --> 17:46.718
So, no one should have expected us to correct all the social, economic, and political ills from the time of Adam and Eve up to 1960.

17:46.798 --> 17:48.701
Well, I've got some more for you, too.

17:48.721 --> 17:49.021
Okay.

17:49.522 --> 18:03.780
Griffin, Keith Griffin says, when he's talking about the credit system, he's saying that the problem with the Great Revolution is that in Pakistan, the farm loan system in Pakistan gave loans to farmers

18:04.148 --> 18:10.256
who had a minimum of 12 to 25 acres, which is a fairly good-sized plot.

18:10.557 --> 18:15.784
And by doing that, that excluded 80% of the farmers in Pakistan.

18:15.824 --> 18:28.381
In other words, the farm loan system was giving credit to the wealthier farmers, the larger farmers, but not to 80% of them, which were the poorer farmers.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.585
Well, what's the date on that?

18:31.625 --> 18:32.766
Do you have the date?

18:32.786 --> 18:33.227
No, I don't.

18:34.844 --> 18:41.893
You will recall, I've already made the mention that the difference in land ownership in Pakistan is quite different than India.

18:42.033 --> 18:52.387
And there are still today some very large landowners in Pakistan.

18:52.707 --> 19:04.783
And as a matter of fact, you may recall that Bhutto came in when he was president and during his campaign, one of his...

19:07.227 --> 19:16.805
political pitches was to redistribute the land, which he did in part, but he didn't distribute any of his own land and he was one of the largest landowners.

19:17.787 --> 19:28.847
How much that had to do with what happened to him subsequently, if you recall, he faced a firing squad, or I guess, yeah, I guess that's the way he was executed.

19:29.367 --> 19:37.561
That was really after the period when this thing had moved into big scale production.

19:38.362 --> 19:47.739
I don't doubt what there were inequities in distribution of credit.

19:49.301 --> 19:53.248
And again, I say it's very nice to criticize.

19:53.853 --> 19:56.837
The question is from you, what power do you have?

19:57.497 --> 20:04.285
I don't have any power except to discuss with the political leaders, which I always used to do.

20:04.325 --> 20:06.108
So that might be a valid criticism.

20:06.488 --> 20:07.229
Up to a point.

20:07.750 --> 20:18.943
But my own personal observations were that it wasn't long before you didn't see any 800 kilo wheat.

20:18.963 --> 20:20.805
Now how that fertilizer got there,

20:22.102 --> 20:27.009
And whether this guy had to pay twice as much or how the hell he got it, I don't know.

20:27.410 --> 20:38.827
And he probably never got the amount that the large landowner got, but he got something because he was growing better wheat, even on the small farmer in Pakistan.

20:39.147 --> 20:40.529
Do you follow what I mean?

20:43.273 --> 20:47.960
There was, in the irrigated area, you soon didn't see any of this.

20:49.002 --> 20:51.906
Very poor wheat except where there was salt.

20:53.860 --> 20:55.582
Salinity problem.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.424
Alkalinity problem.

20:57.444 --> 20:59.706
There, there's no use putting on fertilizer.

21:00.006 --> 21:02.729
The responses are so poor.

21:02.749 --> 21:03.890
That's a different problem.

21:03.910 --> 21:15.683
But you don't have any personal recollection of the problems with the credit system.

21:15.703 --> 21:18.986
Well, the credit system... Were you aware of that at the time?

21:19.206 --> 21:19.767
Oh, sure.

21:21.670 --> 21:25.614
Just like the distribution system was not what you would want.

21:26.155 --> 21:33.483
Sometimes there would be phosphate out in the village and no nitrogen.

21:34.063 --> 21:38.208
Generally it was the other way around, nitrogen and not enough phosphate.

21:38.748 --> 21:49.500
And as a matter of fact, in Pakistan we got into real trouble this way because one year the organization in charge of imports

21:50.797 --> 21:55.607
didn't order on time phosphate.

21:55.627 --> 21:59.935
And so at planting time, in many of the villages, there was no phosphate.

22:00.055 --> 22:02.881
So the farmers started putting on nitrogen.

22:04.424 --> 22:07.370
And the damn wheat responded very well the first year or two.

22:08.071 --> 22:10.696
And so then they got the impression, you don't need phosphate.

22:11.658 --> 22:13.041
And after about

22:13.747 --> 22:17.191
the third year of that, the yields went down dramatically.

22:17.231 --> 22:19.354
They've depleted the phosphate.

22:19.374 --> 22:22.337
And then the word got around the Mexican wheats are running out.

22:23.539 --> 22:29.706
So you can get it through all kinds of things that are beyond your own control.

22:31.989 --> 22:35.653
And then it was a battle back to change this because the

22:36.798 --> 22:46.887
By that simple fact that there was no phosphate and many of those farmers put on nitrogen alone that year and got good responses, then the word spread to hell.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.048
You don't need this.

22:48.068 --> 22:54.153
All you need is nitrogen, even though we knew what was going to happen by small plot treatment.

22:55.755 --> 23:01.320
So, you've got to go back and start extension education all over that.

23:01.360 --> 23:05.303
Look, that's not the seed running out.

23:05.401 --> 23:12.329
depletion of phosphate nutrient that's giving you that reduction in yield, not the seed.

23:16.594 --> 23:18.216
So you gotta battle all of those things.

23:18.777 --> 23:31.712
And then the word, before we ever got to this, I think that this was down at grassroots level before they saw all of this tremendous jump.

23:32.502 --> 23:49.359
and I'm not so sure that it wasn't some vicious scientist also putting it out, that these Mexican wheat seeds were probably going to make the cattle infertile and probably the women also.

23:50.040 --> 23:50.660
Really?

23:50.680 --> 23:52.682
Oh, we got all kinds of this kind of stuff.

23:53.603 --> 23:55.725
It never took on very well, but you pick it up.

23:56.126 --> 23:56.386
Yeah.

23:56.406 --> 23:58.468
You can pick it up around the back country.

24:00.250 --> 24:02.492
So just superstitions from...

24:03.147 --> 24:05.811
It may have been... Some people in India and Pakistan.

24:05.831 --> 24:08.434
This isn't the back country of those countries.

24:09.215 --> 24:11.138
Especially in Pakistan, this one.

24:11.939 --> 24:13.020
I never heard of it in India.

24:14.181 --> 24:15.784
Why would that be?

24:15.804 --> 24:23.233
I mean, well, they just... I think it might well have been one of the scientists of the old guard that was... You know, there was fear.

24:23.554 --> 24:26.758
For example... How about seed producers?

24:27.532 --> 24:28.313
No, they wouldn't.

24:28.754 --> 24:29.955
Or seed distributors?

24:30.416 --> 24:33.480
No, I don't think it would have been to their advantage.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.343
It would have been their disadvantage.

24:36.805 --> 24:42.312
But all sorts of things like that.

24:42.693 --> 24:51.565
You will recall that one of the bitterest fights that we had, also in Pakistan, was that

24:54.734 --> 25:22.463
two very influential people, one who later became the president of one of the universities in the Sindh, said, look, not only are these wheats unsuitable for our purpose for human consumption, but the short straw will result in a shortage of feed

25:23.506 --> 25:27.771
Keep our buffaloes and our bullocks and our cattle alive.

25:28.372 --> 25:31.996
This is the main feed during the long dry season.

25:32.097 --> 25:34.960
Grind it all up and feed it to them.

25:34.980 --> 25:37.343
Bhoosa, they call the ground up straw.

25:37.523 --> 25:38.805
B-H-O-O-S-A.

25:39.726 --> 25:49.978
And so he would say, in open session, I had to face this once.

25:49.998 --> 25:52.922
And the whole planning

25:53.577 --> 25:55.940
group in the top Ministry of Agriculture.

25:56.782 --> 26:06.736
This must have been in 1966 or 67 spring.

26:06.796 --> 26:07.937
I can't remember which.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.102
I say spring, February.

26:11.783 --> 26:22.538
I was supposed to have left to go to... This may be on tape, but if it's not, it's good bits of...

26:24.070 --> 26:27.834
information as to how change takes or doesn't take place.

26:29.697 --> 26:36.465
Left New York and I was supposed to have met Hanson, who was then the Ford Foundation representative.

26:37.706 --> 26:48.879
So it had to be 66 springs, I guess, after we had the 350 tons growing.

26:49.100 --> 26:53.605
We nearly got knocked out with the poor German nation.

26:53.703 --> 26:56.506
I had received word that it looked good.

26:56.526 --> 27:07.799
And so I left in February, probably middle of February from New York to go to Karachi on Pan American.

27:08.580 --> 27:16.369
Went out, the departure was eight o'clock, it started to snow about five and just one of these miserable snowstorms.

27:16.872 --> 27:18.875
And they kept delaying the departure for an hour.

27:18.915 --> 27:21.999
Five o'clock in the morning, they told us no flight.

27:22.419 --> 27:23.921
By then there was that much snow.

27:25.764 --> 27:28.808
Send us back to hotels, only there were no hotels.

27:28.848 --> 27:32.573
There were 26 overseas flights canceled that night.

27:34.175 --> 27:35.717
They sent us to a hotel.

27:35.777 --> 27:40.544
There were only enough room for mothers with children and very elderly people.

27:40.724 --> 27:45.090
The rest of us couldn't even find a place to sit down except on the floor.

27:46.471 --> 28:00.653
I went back to the hotel, the little one, which has since disappeared, Hotel Abbey, Victoria, and I said, look, God, I gotta get some sleep, at least take a shower.

28:00.874 --> 28:03.057
They said, we can't help you, everything's filled.

28:05.801 --> 28:13.253
So I went back out to the airport about five o'clock in the afternoon and I got the first flight out.

28:13.273 --> 28:14.655
I hadn't been to bed then for

28:15.091 --> 28:18.496
This was the second night, and it was a miserable, crowded flight.

28:20.038 --> 28:21.921
I got a center seat.

28:23.904 --> 28:24.865
I got to Karachi.

28:25.246 --> 28:26.167
The plane was late.

28:27.710 --> 28:34.980
At 5.30 in the morning, there was a chauffeur from the Ford Foundation with a note, and he said, there isn't time to go to the hotel.

28:35.962 --> 28:37.664
You go to the little halfway house here.

28:37.724 --> 28:42.972
It's the Dutch Airlines halfway house where some of their pilots sometimes stay.

28:43.036 --> 28:46.521
You take a shower and Hanson will pick you up at 7 o'clock.

28:46.581 --> 28:47.162
This was 5.30.

28:47.883 --> 28:50.066
So I got over there and got a shower.

28:51.328 --> 29:10.917
And originally this was scheduled, the meeting of all of the research people, the minister of agriculture, the deputy, the heads of extension, the heads of soil conservation, procurement, about 30 people.

29:13.276 --> 29:20.048
Hansen, Ford Foundation, Narvaez, my long-time colleague who was posted there then, in Mexico.

29:20.710 --> 29:31.469
Arsvik, who was a Norwegian economist that Hansen had detached from the Harvard group and had located in the Minister of Agriculture's office.

29:34.435 --> 29:37.360
And he used to go with us to look at all the plots.

29:37.559 --> 29:43.885
Most of the other economists would never go out to see what was going on, but Marsvik did.

29:43.905 --> 29:45.826
How do you spell his name?

29:45.987 --> 29:51.872
A-R-E-S-V-I-K, A-D-V-A-R, O-D-V-A-R.

29:55.055 --> 30:06.385
So we got to Lahore, Hanson and I, we walked in, and I really hadn't had any sleep for two days and two nights, miserable.

30:08.491 --> 30:09.472
And they started in.

30:09.512 --> 30:14.760
The minister turned it over to the deputy minister, who was the chairman.

30:14.780 --> 30:22.532
And then one of these people that I was telling you about got the floor and he chewed me for 40 minutes.

30:22.572 --> 30:31.485
He said, this is ridiculous, going into this dwarf wheat program, this Mexican wheat, he called it.

30:31.505 --> 30:32.406
First place.

30:34.512 --> 30:38.258
the cattle are all going to die because of the short straw and the shortage of straw.

30:38.638 --> 30:46.029
Secondly, the wheat tastes different and they aren't going to be eaten.

30:46.049 --> 30:53.741
And I suspect that he's the guy that put out this story about the sterility of the effect on the women and the cattle also.

30:53.761 --> 30:56.084
And what was his name?

30:56.104 --> 31:02.173
I would rather not use it, but he later became the

31:02.879 --> 31:12.751
At that time, he was dean of the University of Sind.

31:12.771 --> 31:13.391
How do you spell that?

31:13.451 --> 31:14.012
S-I-N-D.

31:14.032 --> 31:15.173
It's the southern province.

31:15.294 --> 31:15.794
Oh, okay.

31:15.814 --> 31:20.760
I know where it is.

31:20.780 --> 31:24.484
Then he started talking about, first, the color is wrong.

31:24.504 --> 31:25.906
We only eat white wheats.

31:27.528 --> 31:30.912
Second, they taste different, and we will never eat them.

31:31.972 --> 31:43.687
That previous year, they had imported or been given three million, between three and four million metric tons of PL-480 weight.

31:45.209 --> 31:51.136
And I was, ordinarily if he started like that, if I hadn't been tired, I'd exploded.

31:52.037 --> 31:58.806
But when he was ranting and raving for 40 minutes, I told Nacho, Hanson,

31:59.917 --> 32:10.594
Narvaez and Arzvic were sitting across the table from me, and I told Nacho in Spanish, I said, you don't get into this.

32:12.557 --> 32:15.061
Let me handle it, because you've got to stay here.

32:15.081 --> 32:17.705
If they throw me out, it doesn't make any difference.

32:17.765 --> 32:19.828
You've got to keep the thing going.

32:19.989 --> 32:20.670
Stay out of it.

32:20.910 --> 32:26.599
You tell Arzvic and Hansen, don't get involved, which he did.

32:26.798 --> 32:29.561
undertone when this guy was ranting and raving.

32:29.581 --> 32:31.843
God, he went on for 40 minutes.

32:31.863 --> 32:45.376
And finally, I got a chance to respond and I said, Mr. So-and-so, what was your wheat production last year?

32:46.917 --> 32:48.338
He didn't know, so I told him.

32:50.861 --> 32:51.862
What's your consumption?

32:52.923 --> 32:55.405
He didn't know, so I told him.

32:55.823 --> 33:03.414
Now, the difference between what you produced and what you consumed was important, right?

33:03.774 --> 33:04.115
Yes.

33:06.038 --> 33:09.943
All right, let's now look at this color of grain situation.

33:13.728 --> 33:18.635
What was the color of the grain that came here, which was the vast majority of this?

33:18.976 --> 33:20.778
PL-480 wheat from the US.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.282
What was the color of that grain?

33:24.292 --> 33:24.933
He said, white.

33:25.493 --> 33:26.294
I said, you're wrong.

33:26.314 --> 33:27.095
It was all red.

33:28.797 --> 33:34.224
What was the color of the grain that came from Canada, which was the second largest shipment?

33:35.285 --> 33:35.886
He said, white.

33:35.906 --> 33:39.210
I said, I'm sorry, Canada doesn't grow any white wheat.

33:39.230 --> 33:39.811
It's all red.

33:41.232 --> 33:45.017
Now, the third country that you received wheat from was Australia.

33:45.217 --> 33:47.680
What was the color of the grain from Australia?

33:49.843 --> 33:50.423
He said, red.

33:50.624 --> 33:51.885
I'm sorry, it was white.

33:52.895 --> 33:56.940
He said red and you said it was white.

33:58.002 --> 34:03.529
I said, now will you tell me what's happened to these three and a half to four million tons of grain?

34:04.570 --> 34:05.812
It's not piled around here.

34:05.972 --> 34:08.956
It's disappeared into the stomachs of people.

34:08.976 --> 34:10.237
So what's this all about?

34:14.102 --> 34:16.866
Then he started ranting and raving about taste.

34:19.409 --> 34:20.050
I said, well,

34:21.835 --> 34:24.418
That's down the roadways.

34:24.438 --> 34:26.601
We'll have to do something about that later.

34:28.463 --> 34:29.784
That's got to be a taste panning.

34:30.846 --> 34:34.370
But these other accusations are completely false.

34:36.232 --> 34:46.564
And then we went on to talk to... Then it got on track and we talked about what are we going to do about... The cattle foliage, what about that?

34:47.926 --> 34:51.690
The next year we... At the end of the dry season,

34:52.379 --> 34:53.421
There's truth in that.

34:53.521 --> 34:55.664
You see, this is the grains of truth.

34:57.667 --> 35:08.884
The straw, because of the shortage close to the end of the winter, used to be worth more than the price of grain at harvest.

35:08.904 --> 35:11.788
So it was good business to have lots of straw.

35:11.937 --> 35:19.767
But when you fertilized, as I told him in the discussion, I said, just because they're short, you fertilize that, you plant it very thickly.

35:20.148 --> 35:23.692
The total, and in our reports, it's published, you didn't read them.

35:25.235 --> 35:34.146
You will get much more straw per acre than you got without fertilizing, even though they were tall, because there's few plants.

35:35.388 --> 35:36.750
I said, those data are available.

35:38.512 --> 35:40.054
So there's no reason for this.

35:40.996 --> 35:43.919
But two years from then, they couldn't sell the damn straw.

35:43.959 --> 35:47.002
There was so much of it.

35:47.022 --> 35:53.649
And I have a picture holding it up like this, just enjoying it tremendously.

35:54.590 --> 36:01.237
The next year, though, to show you how these things go, when we finished this meeting, I was dead.

36:02.738 --> 36:06.582
And the minister, who had been minister of agriculture,

36:08.165 --> 36:16.637
had then, just a few days before, become minister of, he had three portfolios, irrigation, education, and something else.

36:18.500 --> 36:25.129
And so, he had invited us, Hansen and Arsvik and Narvaez and I over for tea after the meeting.

36:26.611 --> 36:36.585
By the time I got over there, he's a tremendous guy, about six foot eight, very impressive person, very articulate.

36:37.747 --> 36:41.151
He said, I hear they played pretty rough with you over there.

36:43.914 --> 36:49.060
But he said, I hear that you gave them two for one on everything they tried to pull on you.

36:49.501 --> 36:51.323
And there was big laughing and joking.

36:52.284 --> 36:53.585
So we had tea and left.

36:54.406 --> 37:01.775
But the next year, my vice got this guy maneuvered into a taste panel with the minister presiding.

37:02.496 --> 37:04.819
They took two Mexican weeks.

37:05.039 --> 37:05.419
This dean.

37:05.439 --> 37:06.100
This dean.

37:07.109 --> 37:15.338
two Mexican wheats and two of the best, what were considered to be the best Pakistan wheats.

37:15.358 --> 37:18.481
They milled them, they made the chapatis fresh.

37:18.501 --> 37:19.142
Why not Indian wheats?

37:19.822 --> 37:21.364
Well, they were the same.

37:21.384 --> 37:22.085
Oh, I see, okay.

37:22.105 --> 37:30.073
Because before partition, the main wheat research center was in Laelper, and that's where they were bred.

37:31.354 --> 37:31.595
Yeah, okay.

37:31.615 --> 37:33.977
But they went by,

37:34.649 --> 37:42.379
They considered them Pakistan wheats in Pakistan and Indian wheats in India because of the bloody separation.

37:43.661 --> 37:50.490
So, to make a long story short, they had three men on the taste panel, the deen being one of them.

37:53.454 --> 37:57.159
And they were blinded, of course.

37:57.980 --> 38:01.905
They gave them so many chapatis, they were coated.

38:03.185 --> 38:07.128
The two that turned out in the top were the Mexican wheats.

38:07.769 --> 38:08.189
No kidding.

38:08.209 --> 38:13.334
There's no difference, but just by pure chance.

38:13.354 --> 38:17.978
But you've got to, Jesus, it's miserable when you're trying to provoke change.

38:18.038 --> 38:19.659
Status quo is comfortable.

38:19.679 --> 38:22.762
Yeah, it sure is, yeah.

38:22.782 --> 38:25.565
I mean, you've got these academicians napping at you.

38:26.045 --> 38:31.110
Then you've got these guys trying to scuttle it out there on the front.

38:31.590 --> 38:31.690
Yeah.

38:32.716 --> 38:38.542
And it isn't one thing, it's one after another trying to derail it.

38:38.562 --> 38:43.727
I think, maybe I didn't tell you, one of these people also was the head of extension.

38:45.128 --> 38:45.709
Oh my goodness.

38:46.149 --> 38:47.610
And that person was against it too?

38:48.311 --> 38:49.793
But he was more discreet.

38:50.453 --> 38:57.420
He knew that he never showed these colors in front of the minister.

38:59.842 --> 39:00.563
But...

39:01.555 --> 39:03.859
Narvaez and I were very close to the minister.

39:03.879 --> 39:09.268
We could speak to him just like after we had proven what could be done.

39:09.789 --> 39:24.092
We could speak just like we're speaking now, you and I. And finally I told him, our head of extension is paying lip service, but he's scuttling the whole thing.

39:26.196 --> 39:27.057
He isn't backing it.

39:28.893 --> 39:31.256
This was after the first year we could see it.

39:32.839 --> 39:36.043
And so we had to retrain the extension people.

39:36.104 --> 39:47.560
For example, Narvaez put on training programs how to plant these weeds in several locations, six weeks, two months before planting time.

39:47.901 --> 39:57.735
Actually prepare the land with the bullocks the same way you do, get a good seed bed, fertilize it, and actually plant it, irrigate it.

39:59.909 --> 40:04.153
Afterwards, you'd have to plow it up because it was out of season, but just to train them.

40:04.173 --> 40:16.945
And there we took only the young people, the young extension people, because we knew the resistance up top because of reflecting the head of extension.

40:18.186 --> 40:20.167
And these people became very good.

40:21.729 --> 40:27.334
But we had to get them out away from headquarters also where this guy couldn't come out and bash their heads in.

40:28.765 --> 40:31.228
Yeah, this is the way we got these things out.

40:32.349 --> 40:53.153
But he was still trying to scuttle it, and so a year later I told the minister, I said, you know, Shafiq Gil, head of the extension, says the right things in your presence, but he's not behind the program.

40:53.993 --> 40:57.118
Take him over to Mexico, see if you can do something.

40:57.138 --> 41:09.255
So I brought him over to Mexico and had him with me in Siano for this Northwest Center for about three days on the station trying to show him the whole thing.

41:11.959 --> 41:21.233
Then I said, now I'm going to put you in the hands of some of our best farmers from the farmers co-ops and they're going to show you production.

41:21.253 --> 41:23.376
They'll tell you what it was like around here.

41:23.592 --> 41:30.519
before we had the present varieties, before we fertilized, before we handled the irrigation right, before we controlled the weeds.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.342
And you can see what it's like now.

41:34.903 --> 41:38.887
And I want them to take you to our farmer's co-ops so you see how they're organized.

41:38.907 --> 41:45.273
I want them to take you to the irrigation commission so you see how the water is handled.

41:48.537 --> 41:52.080
As much as you can absorb in the rest of the week, the four days.

41:53.191 --> 42:00.362
And I had never reason to believe these farmers would do the job.

42:00.823 --> 42:03.807
They put on a good show for him.

42:03.827 --> 42:05.910
He left, came back.

42:07.152 --> 42:11.118
By the time I came back, he was acting the same damn way when I got back to Pakistan.

42:12.100 --> 42:15.605
So I went to Narvaez.

42:15.786 --> 42:18.490
Narvaez was complaining bitterly.

42:20.192 --> 42:21.274
So again,

42:22.081 --> 42:27.686
I went to see the minister, and the minister, and I said, he hasn't changed.

42:29.748 --> 42:31.309
He said, I don't understand it.

42:32.270 --> 42:33.371
He says, you know him well.

42:33.391 --> 42:35.873
You've worked with him now for four or five years.

42:36.514 --> 42:44.441
Why don't you go and talk to him alone in his office and try to find out why?

42:47.243 --> 42:47.703
So I did.

42:47.804 --> 42:48.905
I went and sat down.

42:50.906 --> 42:51.767
I said, Shafi?

42:55.797 --> 42:57.719
Why aren't you backing the program?

42:59.221 --> 43:12.756
I said, you say the right things in the presence of the minister, but I know, I've worked with lots of people, and I can see that you're not supporting the program, at least with any vigor.

43:15.238 --> 43:15.519
Why?

43:17.641 --> 43:23.087
He says, look, I've worked for 25 years.

43:24.367 --> 43:35.746
up through the bureaucracy to achieve one of the three top positions in our civil service system, one that pays more or less a decent wage.

43:37.109 --> 43:44.681
Supposing I get involved in this program and there's a new race of rust comes out and it destroys the crop.

43:45.302 --> 43:50.391
It's my job and my family's future, and you probably won't even be here when it happens.

43:51.367 --> 43:56.393
I said, but Shafi, these things have been tested for six years now.

43:57.414 --> 44:05.905
There's no zero biological risk, admittedly, but standing still is loosing ground.

44:08.528 --> 44:16.598
There are more and more Pakistanis wanting food every year, and status quo is a loosing ballgame.

44:17.354 --> 44:19.377
He said, yes, but I won't be blamed for that.

44:19.517 --> 44:22.941
That's someone else's responsibility.

44:22.961 --> 44:25.184
So then I tried to counter in another way.

44:25.444 --> 44:42.746
I said, Shafi, you were in a position so that you should have gotten a grand part of the credit for this change that now can't be denied.

44:42.966 --> 44:44.148
It's coming.

44:44.228 --> 44:45.049
You can't block it.

44:47.628 --> 44:50.973
The train is leaving, Shafiq.

44:50.993 --> 44:55.800
It's pulled out onto the main track already, and it's starting to gain momentum.

44:55.820 --> 44:59.465
You should have been in the locomotive waving the flag and saying, look what we've done.

45:00.086 --> 45:03.211
The way you're acting, you're going to miss the goddamn caboose, and he did.

45:06.155 --> 45:06.976
And he was removed.

45:07.517 --> 45:12.224
Fortunately, he had enough years to retire at full pay.

45:13.466 --> 45:14.327
The minister removed.

45:18.003 --> 45:21.967
I have one good Danish friend.

45:21.987 --> 45:22.808
He's retired now.

45:22.848 --> 45:33.339
He used to be one of the largest farmers in Denmark, in Fleming Junker, and he was interested in all of these things as they related to the psychology of change.

45:35.221 --> 45:43.070
And he says, you should have used my story with Shafi Hill, the head of the extension.

45:43.170 --> 45:45.653
I said, how does that go?

45:45.673 --> 45:47.014
He says, you used the...

45:47.568 --> 45:51.394
symbol of the train, but he said, I put it into words.

45:51.614 --> 45:52.535
It goes like this.

45:53.978 --> 46:01.749
The heavy train with all the inertia, hard to get started, overloaded, trying to pull out of the siding onto the main track.

46:03.412 --> 46:06.977
And it goes, help me, help me.

46:17.386 --> 46:21.370
you go to hell, go to hell, go to hell as it moved down the track.

46:25.154 --> 46:28.317
But there's a lot of truth in this.

46:29.438 --> 46:37.746
The psychology of change and the comfort of status quo is a tremendously frightening thing.

46:37.766 --> 46:39.208
Yeah, it certainly is.

46:39.228 --> 46:47.376
Let's go to another criticism, and that criticism is that the Green Revolution worked against the tenant farmer.

46:47.778 --> 46:58.771
because the owner of the land realized the profit that he could make on the land himself, and therefore kicked the tenant off the land.

46:59.592 --> 47:00.974
What about that?

47:00.994 --> 47:06.761
Well, I can best answer this from my experience in Mexico, where I was very close to it.

47:08.063 --> 47:15.912
At the time, in central Mexico, in the whole Bahio, the old central part,

47:16.583 --> 47:28.258
It was always a sharecroft situation and the thing was set there for the abuse that you were mentioning.

47:28.278 --> 47:33.505
What thing was set there?

47:34.066 --> 47:37.090
When the yields started going up.
