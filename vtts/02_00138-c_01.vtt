WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:26.207
About 9 or 10 o'clock in the evening and a cold front 
started coming through with the accompanying

00:03.220 --> 00:26.207
thunderstorm and it started raining and storming 
and we just knew we weren't going to be able to catch

00:03.220 --> 00:26.207
a ride or worse that we would catch a ride that would 
let us out at Hempstead or Navasota or someplace

00:03.220 --> 00:26.207
like that and we'd get soaked. So about midnight 
this big black Cadillac pulls up and stops and we

00:31.722 --> 00:45.520
look and it's a black fella and Walter and I look at 
each other and we've got to get out of this rain. So

00:46.101 --> 00:48.224
we said, yes sir, where are you going? He said, 
you're going to A&M, aren't you? We said, yes we

00:52.970 --> 00:53.832
are. He said, jump in. So no questions, we didn't 
ask a question, we jumped in and We talked on the way

01:02.435 --> 01:09.686
up, and we found out that he was a graduate student 
at Prairie View. And we talked about that, and we

01:09.706 --> 01:17.617
passed Hempstead, and we passed Waller, and we 
passed Hempstead. And we looked at each other,

01:18.699 --> 01:22.805
because that's where Prairie View is. And we said, 
weren't you going to let us out there at Prairie

01:24.227 --> 01:29.215
View? He says, no. Y'all going to College Station? 
I'm going to tell you to College Station. So he

01:36.657 --> 01:40.261
drove us right up to Hart Hall and let us out. And we 
said, well, we sure do thank you. You know, we shook

01:42.704 --> 01:43.765
hands. He says, that's okay. He says, us Aggies got 
to stick together. Oh, that's good. That's good.

01:49.511 --> 01:50.091
That's good. Did you or anyone else you knew well 
ever have a negative hitchhiking experience?

01:59.281 --> 01:59.982
Or something? No, I don't recall. I've never heard 
of any. I don't recall of one. Back to, we didn't

02:06.066 --> 02:10.171
finish on describing the student body. Where 
geographically in Texas, where did they come

02:10.752 --> 02:14.957
from? Small towns or big cities or what? Mostly,

02:17.320 --> 02:21.926
I would say the small towns.

02:27.093 --> 02:30.137
Particularly rural towns, agrarian. towns and 
although Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, Fort

02:30.522 --> 02:44.298
Worth, and Beaumont, Beaumont is a big Aggie town, 
they send a lot of students up here. My guess is that

02:45.039 --> 02:59.196
it would be 50% those five or six big towns that I 
mentioned and the rest small towns or no towns.

02:59.294 --> 03:05.142
What was the key for an Aggie student to be accepted 
by other Aggies? That he didn't take himself too

03:07.044 --> 03:17.738
seriously, that he had a sense of humor, that he 
could laugh at himself, that he had some good bull

03:07.044 --> 03:17.738
stories. Was he expected to participate like 
everybody else? Oh, absolutely. Actually, we

03:24.847 --> 03:27.951
didn't expect. anything like that. It just 
happened. It evolved. But the person who did not

03:33.837 --> 03:46.173
avail himself of the benefit of the group stood out 
like a sore thumb. And on rare occasions,

03:46.193 --> 03:53.943
a two percenter would find his bags back sitting 
outside his dorm door. And I saw it happen. Really?

03:56.687 --> 03:57.027
Oh, yes. Did some of them, did they leave or did they 
read the handwriting on the wall and change their

03:57.428 --> 04:06.139
attitude?

04:06.900 --> 04:10.886
You'd try to get them to change their attitude 
before it ever got to that point. That was the last

04:10.906 --> 04:13.229
resort. And I don't know of any, I knew of very few 
this occurred to, but I don't know of any that

04:13.249 --> 04:24.043
didn't take the hint and leave. Silver Taps. Do you 
remember going to Silver Taps your first time? I

04:27.383 --> 04:27.864
do. I do. Do you remember? It was the strangest, 
saddest thing. It didn't happen very often

04:34.092 --> 04:39.919
because we were only 6,000, 6,500 students. But it 
would happen maybe once, twice a semester at the

04:40.840 --> 04:45.846
most. Did everybody take it seriously? Very 
seriously. And all the buildings around the inner

04:54.922 --> 05:01.549
circle around Sully's statue and the flagpole and 
the academic building. It went totally dark. All

05:03.031 --> 05:07.476
right, after you all were married, did you go to 
some silver taps? Yes, we did. Did you ever lose a

05:09.338 --> 05:12.201
dear, a close friend while you were? No, I never had 
that experience. I knew of people who did, but we

05:14.664 --> 05:18.328
never had that experience. There were no 
on-campus tragedies during your four years, were

05:18.348 --> 05:22.513
there? I don't remember having heard of any. No. No 
bus crashes and anything like that? No. The worst

05:33.292 --> 05:48.030
thing that happened on campus was when we had the 
terrible cold spell when we registered for

05:33.292 --> 05:48.030
classes on the 30th of January, 1949, the 
temperature dropped to seven degrees below zero

05:48.500 --> 05:50.903
here. Six inches of snow on the ground, we were 
standing in it to register as a piece of mess hall.

05:58.814 --> 06:15.958
The OWL, which was the Southern Pacific Train from 
Houston to Dallas, came through to let people off

05:58.814 --> 06:15.958
at the train station, and a brake line froze, 
condensation in the brake line, and the train

06:17.288 --> 06:18.810
could not move. Now, we thought that was good bull, 
but to Southern Pacific, it was a tragedy because

06:20.892 --> 06:28.241
that train was sitting on the main line.

06:31.244 --> 06:34.788
And I guess they just rerouted trains all over the 
place. But it was a day and a half before they could

06:35.349 --> 06:39.574
get that train out here. Now, how often did Aggies 
ride the train? Very seldom. I did. once or twice as

06:46.685 --> 06:54.175
a last resort, because I couldn't get a ride out of 
Houston. And we'd catch a city bus down to Houston,

06:55.496 --> 07:04.929
catch the train, I think, for two bucks, maybe two 
and a half. Was there a Greyhound bus service then,

07:04.969 --> 07:09.254
here? There was, I guess there was, but I don't 
recall anybody ever writing it. I've never heard

07:15.829 --> 07:18.412
anybody talk about writing it. I never thought of 
it. Let's see. Muster. Do you remember going to

07:24.900 --> 07:26.963
Muster when you were a student? Yes. Where was it 
held? I went the first year. Muster was held in

07:30.687 --> 07:35.533
Guyon Hall, as I recall. Do you remember the 
routine? Did they call the Muster and light

07:36.814 --> 07:38.837
candles? No, the candle services. had not come 
about until Jack Fritz and his wife perfected that

07:42.187 --> 07:53.513
in about in the 60s, I think. But they did call, and 
pretty well did the student body go? The student

07:59.025 --> 08:00.769
body went. And then we held it out in Kyle Field when 
it got too big for guns. Was there a special speaker

08:09.101 --> 08:12.364
at Muster on campus in those days? Always. Always. 
A dignitary of some repute.

08:20.552 --> 08:24.436
Not necessarily of academic repute. Political 
types, former students, corporate presidents

08:28.357 --> 08:30.941
who had done well, that kind of thing. What did, for 
you at that time, what did Muster, what impression

08:31.021 --> 08:36.408
did it make on you? What was its importance? Well, 
the first year, Muster was new to me and I didn't

08:38.972 --> 08:45.581
understand what it was all about. And while I was 
here on campus, it didn't make that much of an

08:45.621 --> 08:57.638
impression on me until many years later in life. I 
became a religious muster dog. See, one of the

09:03.071 --> 09:21.616
things that the former student association has 
done this year that I think is a grievous blunder,

09:03.071 --> 09:21.616
they have been paying the actual travel cost of the 
muster speakers like when I went to Austin. They

09:21.636 --> 09:23.338
paid my mileage. Oh, sure. They've cut that out. It 
will save them a total of $12,000 out of a $6 million

09:26.564 --> 09:30.767
budget. And every muster I've ever, I've done 26 of 
them, every muster I've ever done, I have the

09:32.509 --> 09:47.022
impression that the key thing that audience 
wanted to hear the muster speaker talk about,

09:32.509 --> 09:47.022
what's happening on campus today? What's going 
on? What's important? Like in the last two years,

09:49.604 --> 09:52.887
what about bonfire? And what this is going to do is 
it's going to diminish the number of people that

09:53.002 --> 10:04.854
will go from here to other places because they'll 
say, hey, if I got to pay out of my pocket, I may not do

09:53.002 --> 10:04.854
it. Like I'm going to El Paso, and we've got two 
grandkids out there. And so, OK, I'll do that. But

10:14.885 --> 10:16.947
last year, I did Charleston, South Carolina. Year 
before that, Nashville. Year before that,

10:18.528 --> 10:19.910
Colorado Springs. Year before that, Austin. And I 
think that's not good economy on their part. Do you

10:26.114 --> 10:32.064
mean that they'd cut it out for even going to 
Charleston, South Carolina? Yep. Yep. No longer

10:33.947 --> 10:36.651
will they pay travel expenses. Well, at the 
Capital City A&M Club, when I was president and on

10:36.671 --> 10:47.368
the board for years thereafter, we always paid out 
of club funds. Mm-hmm. Now, there are some clubs

10:48.740 --> 10:51.022
that are not big enough to do that. That's right. 
And so the former students never reimbursed us.

10:54.346 --> 10:55.828
No, no, I agree. And then y'all were responsible 
for putting the person up for the night. That's

10:59.812 --> 11:00.232
right. And which is easy. And their meals. But like 
in Charleston, they only had about 60 people

11:02.415 --> 11:07.040
there. And so they wouldn't have a budget. That's 
hard for a little club. Yeah, and they couldn't do

11:10.483 --> 11:11.484
it. Like when I went to Nashville, they were, hey, 
most of us haven't been to College Station in a good

11:16.432 --> 11:19.597
while. Tell us about it. And then what I love to 
tell, I ask them, how are y'all doing up here? How is

11:25.507 --> 11:26.008
it? And they said, it's great. We can now get Shiner 
beer and Blue Bell ice cream in Nashville. Well,

11:34.602 --> 11:39.110
I'm going to have to speak severely to Porter 
Garner.

11:41.694 --> 11:42.996
Somebody, I think, made a made a goofy decision 
that that's not good economy. I like to think that I

11:48.045 --> 11:52.790
have Porter's ear because he consults with me. Oh, 
good, good, good. From time to time, not that

11:54.592 --> 11:57.214
frequently, but. All right, let me go back.

12:01.519 --> 12:02.720
Student indulgences. They drank beer and 
whiskey. What were people smoking then? Were

12:08.806 --> 12:09.727
Aggies smoking? Oh, yeah. What were they smoking? 
They were smoking Lucky Strikes, Camels, and

12:11.731 --> 12:15.436
Chesterfields. Did Aggie smoke cigars much? 
Sophomores did at Yale practice, so they could

12:20.744 --> 12:25.811
blow the smoke in the freshman's face. And there 
wasn't that much cigar or pipe smoking going on.

12:34.363 --> 12:35.164
Cigarettes, yes. And chewing tobacco or snuff?

12:40.570 --> 12:45.917
I'm the only guy that I know of in my end of Hart Hall 
that chewed tobacco. And I'd make my roommate

12:46.939 --> 12:50.063
sick. I'd pull that big GI can in there and I'd spit 
it in the can. But chewing tobacco was not a big

12:55.951 --> 12:59.676
thing unless you were a baseball player. Oh, yeah, 
yeah. Now, and you all had never heard of the drugs,

13:01.835 --> 13:09.205
marijuana and heroin and all that? No, we didn't 
know what it was. That's what I, all right. To us,

13:12.690 --> 13:14.052
aspirin was a drug. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Did you ever go 
to the quack shack? Were you ever, did you ever get

13:18.699 --> 13:20.502
sick or? The what? The quack shack, the hospital. 
Oh, yeah, I busted my knee up. on the track one time,

13:29.879 --> 13:54.030
I was trying to make a handoff to Bob Hall, we were 
practicing for the 880 relay, and Hall took off a

13:29.879 --> 13:54.030
little too soon, and I stretched too far to get the 
baton to it, and I hit that concrete curb, and just

13:29.879 --> 13:54.030
tore my knee up real bad, and Bill Dayton, the 
trainer, scrubbed it out with surgery, Soap and

13:55.799 --> 13:59.624
put methionine on it. And I got this big red streak 
coming up here. And he said, you got to go to the

14:03.128 --> 14:04.730
hospital. So I went over there to see Mom Claghorn. 
And penicillin had just been invented. So she

14:12.420 --> 14:14.642
said, roll over and pull up your gown. And I did. And 
she gave me a few shots of penicillin. In three

14:18.868 --> 14:20.670
days, I was out of the hospital. And describe her 
and her style of operating. the hospital i didn't

14:25.685 --> 14:49.144
have that much direct contact with mom herself 
there was a cute little nurse there that who

14:25.685 --> 14:49.144
ministered to me and mom was she

14:25.685 --> 14:49.144
was sweet but firm no nonsense she was kind of like 
uh A pleasant version of Marjorie Maine, I'd say.

14:53.999 --> 14:55.581
And she was in charge. There was no doubt that she 
was in charge. Let's see. You didn't go to Junction

15:04.653 --> 15:08.298
to summer camp or anything like that ever. Every 
summer, even after you were married, did you go

15:08.739 --> 15:12.924
back and work in Beaumont? Every summer, as soon as 
I could get out of here. The nice thing about that,

15:19.398 --> 15:23.081
These are distinguished student cards. And I have 
one for every semester. I was here at A&M. And the

15:28.586 --> 15:46.983
nice thing about a distinguished student card was 
that if a prof says, OK, we're going to have a pop

15:28.586 --> 15:46.983
quiz, you could stand up and say, Dr. So-and-so, 
Professor So-and-so, I'm going to walk this

15:28.586 --> 15:46.983
class. He'd say, all right. And this is your 
get-out-of-jail-free card. And the other nice

15:55.477 --> 16:09.579
thing about it was, if you were a distinguished 
student, you had no grade below a B in that course,

15:55.477 --> 16:09.579
you did not have to take a final exam. You had to take 
a midterm, but not a final. I never took a final. And

16:18.313 --> 16:19.054
that was the When I tell that to students season 
A's, golly, they can't believe that. They never

16:27.416 --> 16:28.056
heard of that. Did you make any grade that you then 
considered low, any course?

16:34.966 --> 16:37.510
Yeah, I made a B in. No C's and D's? No. Okay. No, I 
never made a C. Okay. And you didn't compute. I was

16:45.060 --> 16:47.484
disappointed with a B that I got. Nobody computed a 
GPA then. You didn't know what your grade point

16:50.607 --> 16:52.610
average was, did you? No. You got a transcript, and 
it had on there the number of hours that you took and

16:53.271 --> 17:04.287
the number of grade points that you got. And you 
could figure up your own grade point average if you

17:04.367 --> 17:07.992
wanted to. But nobody talked about it in the way 
that they do today. All right. Evaluate the great,

17:13.783 --> 17:22.453
the best, the finest, the most respected teachers 
you had as you now think. Talk about some of those.

17:25.016 --> 17:26.678
Who were some of those fine teachers?

17:29.841 --> 17:35.488
I wish I'd had some warning on that.

17:35.508 --> 17:36.409
John B. Longley. Johnny Longley. What did he 
teach? He taught life insurance. He was the local

17:42.181 --> 17:48.109
American General Life Insurance Company 
representative here. He was highly respected in

17:48.129 --> 17:53.356
the business community, and all of his students 
loved him. Johnny was a World War II vet, and he'd

17:54.297 --> 18:01.646
gotten his foot shot off in Europe. Another highly 
respected prof was Joe Vincent. who taught

18:07.557 --> 18:11.421
property and casualty insurance. These guys were 
private individuals who helped the school out

18:11.441 --> 18:20.550
because they had nobody with that kind of 
expertise. Johnny had a degree, but it certainly

18:22.692 --> 18:26.616
wasn't an education. And as you think about what 
they taught now, as you evaluated it, it was high

18:26.636 --> 18:36.045
quality, real world? They told us what we needed to 
know about the subject matter at hand. And when you

18:41.394 --> 18:44.257
went out into the real world, you found it worked. 
It was exactly like they said it was. Today, I can

18:47.901 --> 19:01.356
sit down and read a life insurance policy and a 
property and casualty insurance policy just as

18:47.901 --> 19:01.356
easily as I can read a novel based on what John B. 
Longley and Joe Vincent taught me. And it hasn't

19:01.417 --> 19:02.758
changed. And should identify for the person 
typing this up that Joe Vinson was one of the

19:03.228 --> 19:12.061
founders of what is now ANCO Insurance. It was 
called Mitchell Vinson for a while. Yes. And then

19:16.528 --> 19:22.757
it became ANCO as they acquired ownership of an old 
company, Anderson. And he's in cahoots with Red

19:23.057 --> 19:24.880
Cash. Yes, yes, yes. What about some other great 
teachers and or counselors that you know? My, I'd

19:31.730 --> 19:47.243
have to say my Bulltex prof, a captain, he was an Air 
Force captain, and he encouraged me to apply for a

19:31.730 --> 19:47.243
regular commission. I can't recall his name, but 
he kind of mentored me through Air Force Bulltex.

19:57.752 --> 20:01.315
If you... And another was... Ray Putnam, who 
taught agricultural economics. And of course he

20:07.795 --> 20:11.681
was also assistant track coach. And I had a course 
in ag eco that I took from him and was very impressed

20:11.701 --> 20:20.957
with his methodology. Was there anybody that you 
would turn to for academic advice? What should I

20:27.675 --> 20:28.596
take? What courses should I attempt this year or 
next year? Who was your counselor? Didn't have

20:37.404 --> 20:39.927
any.

20:41.468 --> 20:48.015
I'm not aware of any that we had in the business 
department because the curriculum was so narrow.

20:48.155 --> 20:51.298
They had certain basic courses that you had to 
take. And then there wasn't that much left over in

20:51.700 --> 20:55.223
the way of electives. About how large was the 
average section of a business course? How many

20:59.247 --> 20:59.968
students? How many students? I'd say 20 to 25 at the 
most. And what was your routine? Did you study just

21:10.278 --> 21:12.560
about every day, every night? I took good notes. I 
took shorthand in high school.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.415
I would review those notes at night.

21:26.458 --> 21:39.310
I would use the textbook if I knew that we were going 
to get questions coming out of it or if I needed to

21:26.458 --> 21:39.310
refer to the textbook to expand what we had gotten 
in class. But what we got in class was practical

21:39.390 --> 21:42.352
stuff. It was not theory. It was hands on, here is a 
life insurance policy. If you're going to be in

21:49.177 --> 21:53.884
insurance sales, well, these are the things 
you've got to know about this policy. And here's

21:54.504 --> 21:57.268
how you make out a life insurance application. You 
can study all the theory in Cushing Library. It's

22:02.416 --> 22:05.580
not going to tell you how to fill out a life 
insurance application. Now, by the time you were,

22:05.600 --> 22:10.627
say, a junior, what did you think your career was 
going to be? What were you going to do, you hoped? I

22:13.190 --> 22:17.535
was going to go with American General Life 
Insurance Company. John B. had convinced me that

22:17.895 --> 22:23.301
that was the way I ought to go. Headquartered in 
Houston. Headquartered in Houston, headed up by

22:24.823 --> 22:27.986
Mr. Gus Wertham. And John B. even arranged a visit 
for me with Mr. Gus

22:29.248 --> 22:38.798
in the spring of my senior year. Although they 
already knew that We were at the height of the

22:43.463 --> 22:50.913
Korean War, and they already knew that I'd been 
nominated for a regular commission, was gonna go

22:43.463 --> 22:50.913
that route. But John B. wanted Mr. Gus to see me, and 
so that when I finished my tour of duty, that he

22:51.834 --> 23:05.353
said, there's a spot for you here at American 
General. And I'm telling you, that was some

23:06.683 --> 23:10.188
sanctum sanctorum. You had to get through two 
secretaries before you got into Mr. Gus's inner

23:10.688 --> 23:15.976
office. Now, do you remember what building it was 
in Houston then? It was in the Mel's Esperson

23:20.201 --> 23:25.429
building in downtown Houston. Near the Rice 
Hotel. Was he pleasant once you got in to chat with

23:26.911 --> 23:29.474
him? Like talking to your grandfather. Oh, how 
good, how good. And did he offer you a... a slot when

23:36.704 --> 23:37.965
you got out? He said, there will be a place for you 
here when you finish your Air Force tour of duty. He

23:44.892 --> 23:46.393
didn't mention salary or anything? Oh, no. You 
didn't talk about that. I was going to say, that

23:50.878 --> 23:52.419
would have been, that would have been. That would 
have been gauche. Who were the campus, great

23:55.963 --> 24:01.408
campus personalities while you were here? Now, 
the president when you got here was Gilchrist?

24:07.754 --> 24:09.196
Or was it already, or was it? Tom Harrington was the 
interim president. And then he became, Gilchrist

24:12.160 --> 24:20.893
last year was I think the spring of 48, and then Tom 
Harrington was the interim. And then he became the

24:21.974 --> 24:28.123
president I think in the spring semester of 49. Did 
you guys see Dr. Harrington much, you students?

24:31.768 --> 24:34.272
Dr. Harrington was always around the campus. He 
walked. He, you'd see him in the corridors. I don't

24:39.850 --> 24:45.596
recall that he ever visited a class, but he knew 
your, he knew your name. And I'd always see him

24:46.977 --> 24:51.762
walking back and forth on campus from one building 
to another. Did your students have a high regard

24:51.902 --> 24:53.684
for him? Absolutely the best. What, who else was 
around, the notables? Colonel Hayden L. Boatner.

25:03.333 --> 25:05.976
Boatner was also visible. Now, he was here when you 
got here? Yes. And he was the commandant? He was.

25:10.425 --> 25:12.808
Now, he was not an Aggie by background, was he? He 
was a West Pointer. Physically, he was what size?

25:18.874 --> 25:23.399
Colonel Boatner was, I'd say, about 5'9", 5'10". 
Slightly rotund.

25:30.246 --> 25:31.107
Sparse hair. Don't remember the color of his eyes. 
but I remember he was all business.

25:43.367 --> 25:59.393
I remember one time he smiled at me when I was 
sitting on the sidewalk outside of Guyon Hall

25:43.367 --> 25:59.393
talking to a friend of mine and Colonel Boatner 
comes walking up the sidewalk and I jumped up and I

25:43.367 --> 25:59.393
hit a brace and said good afternoon Colonel 
Boatner and he smiled. He could actually smile.

26:02.200 --> 26:09.070
And Colonel Joe Davis, who was a deputy 
commandant, and Joe Davis took over for Colonel

26:02.200 --> 26:09.070
Boatner. Fighting Joe. Fighting Joe, different 
kind of guy, accessible,

26:10.231 --> 26:17.402
reachable. Boatner was distant. And nobody 
would, y'all never thought about trying to play

26:19.865 --> 26:23.891
any jokes on him? Oh yeah. Oh really, on Boatner? Oh 
yeah. Such as? WTAW, Watch Texas Aggies Win, they

26:29.335 --> 26:41.189
had a call-in request program for spinning 
records. And at that time, Arthur Godfrey was very

26:41.209 --> 26:44.673
popular. And he had a little ditty out called, Heat 
Big Smoke But No Fire. And students would call it,

26:55.778 --> 27:00.484
They'd get 10 requests a night for heat, big smoke, 
but no fire. And I know it must have steamed

27:00.504 --> 27:05.650
Boatner, being a West Porter and all. He was 
stuffy. This is Cardinal Boatner speaking. And

27:11.256 --> 27:15.421
everybody was supposed to face east and bow down. 
Was Pinky around? Pinky? Yes, Pinky was around in

27:20.107 --> 27:23.811
his 36 green Ford Coupe. You saw Pinky all over the 
campus, every place. Now, were you all aware of

27:27.949 --> 27:31.832
whether or not he was an Aggie employee? Yeah, we 
knew that he was the official greeter

27:34.155 --> 27:40.141
non-employee. And he was just kept on, like old 
Uncle Mose was kept on the plantation. And

27:48.489 --> 27:52.633
everybody made sure that Pinky was taken care of by 
whatever means there was. The deans during your

27:56.365 --> 27:59.248
era, who were they?

28:02.472 --> 28:03.853
Well, Harrington was a dean. He'd been promoted by 
the time I got here. Dean John Paul Abbott, dean of

28:08.318 --> 28:11.942
arts and sciences.

28:16.808 --> 28:22.975
I can't recall many of the deans outside my own 
school. Then

28:24.912 --> 28:28.796
Reveille. We had no Reveille here. Where was 
Reveille? The Reveille was dead. No, but didn't

28:38.266 --> 28:40.548
they have a Reveille 2 or 3 or 4? No. You're saying 
there wasn't? There was none. Reveille 2 didn't

28:45.533 --> 28:51.780
come along until many years later in the 60s.

28:52.140 --> 28:53.081
I didn't know that. Go check the gravestones. down 
there outside the... No, no, my astonishment, and

28:55.102 --> 29:07.040
I'm not questioning you, my astonishment is that I 
assumed that there had always been from Reveille 1

28:55.102 --> 29:07.040
all the way through. No, once Reveille 1 died, I 
don't know why there wasn't an immediate Reveille

29:07.080 --> 29:21.902
2, but we had a dog that was kind of a favorite on 
campus, but never occupied the the spot that

29:22.321 --> 29:24.323
Rivoli did. Her name was Violet. She was a black 
dog. Matter of fact, I've got a picture here. Yeah,

29:33.014 --> 29:39.282
that's Violet with some stray dog. And the 
outstanding thing about Violet, she was an

29:39.302 --> 29:48.774
average-sized dog, but her paws were about as big 
as horses' hooves. Monstrous. And she was a

29:51.160 --> 29:54.624
friendly dog, and she'd wander through some 
decent people's dorms. And we've met her here and

29:55.384 --> 29:59.629
all, but she was not a rebel. Were you aware that 
there were secret fraternities on the campus

30:00.369 --> 30:06.496
then? I was aware of one called the True Texans.

30:15.344 --> 30:20.830
And I was aware of some people who were alleged to 
have been true Texans, but none within my

30:21.637 --> 30:29.686
immediate sphere of influence. Did you ever hear 
of the Stickers? No.

30:35.252 --> 30:37.915
Okay, let's go back to track now. So sophomore year 
for you and track, did it go well? It went very well.

30:48.627 --> 30:49.888
We started out the year with our usual dual and 
triangular meets. And we went to the border

30:55.541 --> 30:59.344
Olympics. And I won the high hurdles there and 
placed

31:01.146 --> 31:09.513
third in the low hurdles. My lack of speed was 
starting to catch up with me. I had technique and

31:13.957 --> 31:19.302
power, but I didn't have speed. And the guys I was 
running against in the low hurdles
