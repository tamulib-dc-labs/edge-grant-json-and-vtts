00:13.649 --> 00:17.495
Tell me something about your family situation, 
where you lived in 1975. I live in Vietnam, in

00:17.635 --> 00:24.004
Saigon, the main city. And practically the whole 
family is in the military, my dad and my uncles and

00:25.066 --> 00:33.258
all that. And my mom, she was a banker in Vietnam. 
And we were still going to school, to elementary

00:39.923 --> 00:45.028
school in 75.

00:48.050 --> 00:49.992
So you were there in Saigon during the fall? 
Uh-huh. We were still in there. In fact, the whole

00:52.394 --> 00:57.118
family, nobody was out of town or anything. 
Everybody was at home by that time. Can you tell me

01:01.082 --> 01:04.225
about the final few days there in Saigon? Well, it 
was pretty crazy. Everybody's going berserk

01:06.987 --> 01:09.289
because they know it's going to, you know, this 
country's going to fall and fail, you know. And

01:15.111 --> 01:26.505
basically everybody's running around trying to 
look for a place so that they could escape, and the

01:15.111 --> 01:26.505
main one was just at the U.S. Embassy. That's where 
the main place, because at the last minute, there

01:27.066 --> 01:35.496
were at least a couple of helicopters flying back 
and forth trying to take out the Americans that are

01:35.645 --> 01:41.213
still there. And all these people trying to get in 
and trying to jump in, trying to escape with them.

01:49.345 --> 01:51.047
And that's one way. And the other way is everybody 
went out to the port to go on the ship that was either

01:51.127 --> 02:03.205
an oil tanker or a or an American Navy ship that were 
there for a long time. And they would go and they

02:11.776 --> 02:17.682
would be gone, taken away to wherever the boat was. 
And so everybody was just crowded up there trying

02:17.823 --> 02:21.246
to get in. It was real hectic. A lot of vandalized 
people shopped in stores, getting all the windows

02:23.929 --> 02:32.199
broken, all the stuff stolen. But they didn't care 
because You know, they'd rather have freedom more

02:33.813 --> 02:39.443
than living with the communists and all that. And 
they were worried about their family. And the

02:41.627 --> 02:46.455
young people, they really wanted to go. And some, 
you know, they stayed back. Some, they decided

02:48.499 --> 02:54.710
that if there was no way, they'd probably stay back 
and try to live through it. Did you see any troops?

02:58.720 --> 03:27.647
When I was out in the street, there wasn't any troop 
maneuvering at all, but a couple nights before the

02:58.720 --> 03:27.647
final took over, we were in a church, and I could see 
that there were military tanks and all that moving

02:58.720 --> 03:27.647
down the street, and I didn't know which side it was 
on, but I'm pretty sure that... I'm pretty sure

03:28.808 --> 03:35.475
that it was the South moving backward, trying to 
pull back. And also, behind the tank, there were a

03:35.495 --> 03:43.383
whole bunch of soldiers just running back. In 
fact, everybody from the South Vietnamese army

03:43.744 --> 03:54.715
was just pulling back and taking off their clothes 
so that they could hide their identity. so that

03:55.049 --> 04:02.262
just in case if the colonists come in, they won't 
know that he was in the army, you know, in the forces

03:55.049 --> 04:02.262
and all that. And after that was gone, you know, you 
would see a whole bunch of bum people where they

04:02.322 --> 04:18.492
would go and pick up the stuff that the soldier had 
dropped, you know, like guns and clothes or

04:02.322 --> 04:18.492
maybe... If the soldiers, they didn't care what 
they drop off. They drop off their ID and wallets

04:21.147 --> 04:25.552
and all that. So they had some money. So those bum 
people or poor people, they would go and try to look

04:26.833 --> 04:38.765
for money or cigarettes, you know, a few 
cigarettes to smoke and all that. And some food

04:38.785 --> 04:43.029
like, you know, candies or something like that. 
Try to pick up whatever's left. What did your

04:46.012 --> 04:47.254
family do? Did you all try to leave through the 
embassy? My mom and my dad took three of us to the

04:51.843 --> 04:57.593
embassy on our car. And when we got there, it was so 
crowded that we couldn't barely move the car. So my

05:03.103 --> 05:06.990
dad knew that we had no chance of getting in. So 
because there were people all over the place. They

05:11.077 --> 05:13.022
were climbing on fences and all that. And so we 
decided to go back home. And basically, our whole

05:17.112 --> 05:36.253
family just stayed at home because my 
grandmother, at that time, she wanted everybody

05:17.112 --> 05:36.253
to be together, especially in our house, so that 
she know where everybody is and she know that

05:17.112 --> 05:36.253
nobody's going to be missing and all that. Because 
during the hectic, you want to keep your family

05:36.293 --> 05:41.900
together so that you won't have any trouble 
finding them. And when we went home after we went to

05:41.920 --> 05:46.765
the embassy, My grandma told us that why don't we go 
to the church and stay there a couple nights just in

05:47.234 --> 06:00.938
case if the communists come in early and they would 
take my dad away so fast. So in other words, we went

06:01.158 --> 06:03.522
to the churches. you know, just to hide out for a 
couple of days. And we went there. But otherwise,

06:09.639 --> 06:14.125
we didn't think of going to the port or anything 
like that. We thought that the embassy was our last

06:14.145 --> 06:17.370
choice. And it wasn't open, so we thought 
everybody just stayed home. And in fact, One

06:25.000 --> 06:33.192
night, the night that we were supposed to go to the 
church, we had dinner, and it was just a normal,

06:25.000 --> 06:33.192
regular old family dinner. Of course, a lot of 
people in my family, they were planning. They were

06:41.283 --> 06:48.173
thinking real hard trying to find a way to escape. 
Somehow, it was real quiet and all that. They

06:55.625 --> 06:56.786
couldn't think of the port. And afterward, when we 
got over here, my mom was real mad. Because if we

07:01.330 --> 07:15.544
would have thought of going to the port, then the 
whole family could have gone together instead of

07:01.330 --> 07:15.544
going one by one over.

07:16.199 --> 07:18.883
Basically, the port was the main thing. A lot of 
Vietnamese people that wanted to get out got out by

07:18.903 --> 07:30.823
the port at the last

07:18.903 --> 07:30.823
minute before the communists came in. In fact, 
when the communists came in, there was this one

07:32.285 --> 07:40.418
ship that had loaded a whole bunch of people. They 
took off shore just in time before the communists

07:41.073 --> 07:46.098
came in. And those people got out. And the people 
that were still left on the shore, they were so

07:49.541 --> 07:55.087
unhappy. So they didn't know what to do. So they 
would just go home. And they said, well, that's it.

07:59.331 --> 08:01.273
That's the last chance we could leave. So what did 
your family do immediately after the fall, when

08:03.215 --> 08:08.040
the communists were in? After the fall, we We went 
on our daily lives, but of course, during that

08:11.448 --> 08:22.504
time, I think around at least two or three, two 
weeks, there wasn't any work. You know, my mom

08:22.872 --> 08:24.414
didn't go to work. My dad didn't go to work. Nobody 
went to work. In fact, everybody stayed at home.

08:29.201 --> 08:34.889
And we practically just stayed inside the house so 
that, you know, so that just to keep out of trouble.

08:34.909 --> 08:38.274
And in fact, I'm pretty sure that all the other 
families are too, you know. So the street was just

08:38.655 --> 08:41.219
deserted and all that. But basically, we just went 
on doing our daily life stuff and all that except

08:41.299 --> 08:47.087
for going to work. And, you know, We all knew, my mom 
and my grandmother, you know, they all knew that

08:50.969 --> 08:58.056
one day my dad's going to get taken. So, in fact, in 
other words, you know, we just stayed at the house

08:58.176 --> 09:06.344
just waiting for them to, for the communist to 
knock on the door, you know. That's all. And, you

09:07.366 --> 09:09.267
know, we minded our own business. There wasn't, we 
didn't visit any friends. We didn't have any

09:11.830 --> 09:15.113
visitor or anything like that at all. It was just 
like a family only in one house and all that. So what

09:20.264 --> 09:21.768
finally happened with your father? Well, after 
that two weeks, business started going. You know,

09:27.505 --> 09:35.168
people starting to open their shops and going to 
work and all that.

09:35.485 --> 09:49.777
The communist, they started to come to our house a 
couple of times, you know, stay around two or three

09:35.485 --> 09:49.777
hours just going in, acting real friendly, you 
know, talking to my dad and all that. And there were

09:50.018 --> 09:52.363
like around five of them. They came in wearing 
their uniform, and they drove up by, you

09:52.732 --> 10:08.361
know, they used a jeep to drive to our house, and 
they went in, and when they came in, My dad and my mom

10:08.695 --> 10:17.735
stayed out and talked to them, but my mom told us to 
go inside to the bedroom and stay in there. But I was

10:20.260 --> 10:26.113
so curious, and my sister was so curious, too, so we 
would... sneak out, you know, just take a little

10:26.093 --> 10:30.841
peek and hear what they're saying and all that. And 
basically it was a real friendly conversation

10:31.142 --> 10:36.912
asking, you know, how it is and all that. And then 
after that, and then after that, uh, they, They

10:42.749 --> 10:50.044
come back a couple of days, going back, talking to 
my dad and all that. And then at the last meeting

10:50.064 --> 11:04.673
that they had, the same five guys that came a whole 
bunch of time, they came and they just took him

10:50.064 --> 11:04.673
away. And my mom, she knew that the first meeting 
that they had, she knew that a couple more times and

11:05.075 --> 11:15.030
he's going to be taken away. So she packed his 
clothes and gave him some packed medicine for him.

11:21.815 --> 11:29.247
In fact, he had luggages already packed for him to 
be ready if they should take him away. There

11:30.388 --> 11:34.375
wouldn't be any frantic of taking his clothes and 
just dumping them in, you know. It was all ready

11:34.555 --> 11:35.877
there. And the thing was just we were just waiting 
for them, you know, when are they going to take him

11:36.438 --> 11:41.266
away. And the last time they came, they took him 
away. And... That was when, on that same day, they

11:46.790 --> 12:06.192
wanted all of the people that were involved in the 
Army to meet at an elementary school so that they

11:46.790 --> 12:06.192
could, you know, they say that they could have a 
meeting and all that, but actually it wasn't a

11:46.790 --> 12:06.192
meeting. It was for them to be taken away to a 
concentration camp. So your father was taken away

12:13.540 --> 12:16.063
to this concentration camp? Mm-hmm. Where was it? 
Nobody knew. All the other families have their

12:22.576 --> 12:32.659
husband or brothers or son taken away, but they 
didn't know where. They were gone because when

12:32.639 --> 12:42.340
they started to loading people up, they told them 
not to follow. They told them that just say goodbye

12:42.560 --> 12:49.315
and go home and don't follow us. you know when when 
they get situated you know they'll they'll get

12:49.295 --> 13:08.012
some information about it but they were just 
saying that but a lot of people they didn't know it

12:49.295 --> 13:08.012
so they believed it so a lot of people were real 
happy about it and they just went home and didn't

12:49.295 --> 13:08.012
follow but you know my mom she knew that that it was 
going to be a long time before she would get the

13:08.870 --> 13:14.619
first letter from my dad. And so they took him away, 
and for I think around half a year or something like

13:15.260 --> 13:25.275
that, There was just no news. I mean, just no news. 
My mom would not know where my dad was or where he's

13:28.079 --> 13:38.612
at or how he's doing because they would not tell you 
anything. And a lot of wives were starting to get

13:38.792 --> 13:42.737
panic. They were starting to panic. They said, 
They kept on going to the personnel office. It's

13:49.325 --> 13:54.230
kind of like a headquarter for a particular 
region. And they would come in, they would

13:54.671 --> 14:03.020
complain, they would say, how come you said that 
you would give us some news and now you're not going

13:54.671 --> 14:03.020
to and all that. And they would make up some excuse 
that there's some trouble or... or they or they

14:07.645 --> 14:27.831
might have gotten lost or something like that and 
they would make up like they would be on the same

14:07.645 --> 14:27.831
boat as we are they don't know uh what where they are 
or you know where they're at or you know or those

14:07.645 --> 14:27.831
things you know so those wives they were getting 
pretty restless and all that So they thought, you

14:27.811 --> 14:40.686
know, a lot of people said, oh, no, my husband's 
probably dead or something, because you don't

14:27.811 --> 14:40.686
know if he might have died on the way there or he 
might die from them being killed. And a lot of

14:41.026 --> 14:48.195
people thought that those the communists would 
take them on the bus so that they would take them out

14:41.026 --> 14:48.195
in the countryside and would execute them all. 
That's what they thought. There were a lot of, you

14:50.337 --> 14:52.840
know, a lot of. rumors of what was gonna happen to 
those men that were taken away. And so everybody

15:00.579 --> 15:05.213
was just really crazy, going crazy. And finally, A 
couple weeks later, finally, they would get their

15:07.940 --> 15:15.010
husband's letter and all that. My dad sent one to 
us, and he wrote it to us, and he told us that he

15:17.053 --> 15:31.914
doesn't know where he's at. He said that it is 
somewhere out in the country. with farming and all

15:36.087 --> 15:38.651
that. And he said that they're living in a shed 
that's made out of trees, made out of leaves and all

15:39.232 --> 15:48.846
that. And he said that he had no idea where it is. And 
he said that on the trip, it took very long. And they

15:57.999 --> 16:05.470
did not drop all of the people that were taken in the 
same place. dropped one truck to this place and the

16:05.450 --> 16:08.956
other truck to the other place. In other words, 
they spread them all out in the countryside. And he

16:12.302 --> 16:17.171
said that he doesn't know where he's at. And he just 
told us that he's all right and all that. And

16:22.500 --> 16:29.432
basically what he did was he wrote the letters and 
he would tell them our address and they would mail

16:30.087 --> 16:50.847
it to him so in other words if after he writes it they 
would check it they would read it and check if he

16:30.087 --> 16:50.847
would you know tell them tell tell my mom anything 
any clue or anything but and so if whenever if my dad

16:30.087 --> 16:50.847
would say something wrong what they would do is 
they would get some glue and they would remove that

16:52.109 --> 16:59.376
whole sentence out so that my mom would not know, 
you know, like that. So after we were real happy to

17:00.457 --> 17:10.245
receive his letter, you know, that's better than 
nothing because now we know that, you know, he's

17:00.457 --> 17:10.245
still alive and all that. And he said he was well. 
And so we took his word. And then after those

17:13.829 --> 17:22.116
letters, the wives would come back and ask those 
guys again, the personnel, that how... how they

17:22.096 --> 17:49.791
supposed to send letters to them if they wanted to 
and so what they say is they would tell them to bring

17:22.096 --> 17:49.791
it to them so that they will mail it so in other words 
you have to go through them so that they would

17:22.096 --> 17:49.791
proofread it and erase whatever they you write 
that is wrong that is unacceptable and then they

17:22.096 --> 17:49.791
mail it to you know to to whoever that you want it to 
be mailed so what did your family do plan to do now

17:50.395 --> 17:52.465
that your father was gone? Well, after my dad was 
taken, well, before my dad was taken, my... My mom

17:59.153 --> 18:06.544
and the whole family planned what are we going to do 
after my dad was going to be gone. And in fact, we had

18:06.764 --> 18:10.169
a lot of discussion about it. And my mom, she was 
planning to stay back. And she was planning for us

18:14.355 --> 18:22.467
three, two of my sister and I, and my aunt to escape. 
And she would stay back and take care and wait for my

18:22.808 --> 18:28.536
dad. My dad, you know? How long did y'all think he 
was going to be held? We thought that he was going to

18:34.513 --> 18:38.323
be held for a real short time. For the soldiers, 
they would be held at least one or two years. But for

18:43.691 --> 18:52.760
him, since he is an officer, my mom and everybody 
else thought that he would be held around five

18:43.691 --> 18:52.760
years. And so she thought that if she would have 
waited, it would still be fine, because five years

18:54.022 --> 19:02.310
is really short. And by that time, when he comes 
out, then both of them could escape together. So we

19:07.295 --> 19:12.123
agreed on that. But then my dad wanted my mom to go 
with us because he felt that my aunt was not old

19:12.163 --> 19:28.388
enough to take control of us because my aunt at that 
time, she was only 13. So she was pretty young also.

19:30.592 --> 19:32.695
So he wanted... a mature adult to be with us so that 
we would get through once we escaped. So my dad

19:42.290 --> 19:45.575
convinced my mom to go. So my mom said that, okay, 
she'll go. And if she goes, my grandmother stayed

19:49.121 --> 19:54.630
back and helped my dad out. And then when he comes 
out, then they both will leave. And so that was the

19:59.084 --> 20:02.593
final decision. So then my mom and us three and my 
aunt would leave. And they would say five years

20:09.230 --> 20:16.047
later, my dad and my grandparents would go 
together. And so we would leave. And it took us a

20:19.010 --> 20:34.457
year to plan the escape, to buy boats and how many 
people are going to go, how much money we're

20:19.010 --> 20:34.457
supposed to pay for the boat and how many days and 
all that. So your mother was doing all of this in

20:34.724 --> 20:36.587
secret? Yes. She was doing all this with the other 
people that were planning to go with us. And the

20:42.616 --> 20:47.243
other people were basically just real close 
relatives. Two of my uncles went with us, and he

20:48.665 --> 20:53.172
was... Two of my uncles, which they are on my dad's 
side, went with us and my mom's best friend and her

20:53.152 --> 21:02.965
three kids. Otherwise, we planned an escape that 
everybody would know each other. Everybody was

21:09.955 --> 21:13.760
friendly so that there would not be any argument. 
And there would not be any argument on what to do and

21:14.521 --> 21:18.366
all that. And so they planned secretly. They would 
plan late at night. And my mom, she would go down to

21:27.313 --> 21:31.107
the coast

21:32.740 --> 21:38.608
compromise with the fishermen to sell one of their 
boats to us. Because back then, if you were a

21:39.149 --> 21:50.766
fisherman, you basically had around at least 
three ships, three boats or even more. to for you to

21:50.746 --> 22:13.210
fish and so they they would sell us one but they 
would give us a really high price for it that that

21:50.746 --> 22:13.210
you know that it's just unbelievable but you just 
have to try to convince them that you know that

21:50.746 --> 22:13.210
that's all the money you have but basically what 
they wanted to do was they wanted you to give them

21:50.746 --> 22:13.210
all the money that you have because They were 
thinking that since you're going to be leaving,

22:13.190 --> 22:20.888
you're going to make it so that when you come over 
there, you're going to make more money. So why

22:21.108 --> 22:25.278
should you keep the Vietnamese money when you can 
give it to them? That's basically why the cost was

22:25.658 --> 22:29.427
so high. So y'all finally did get a boat. We finally 
got a boat, and it was a very small boat.

22:36.848 --> 22:38.111
Twenty-four people went. There were four men, 
which three of them were my uncles, and one of them

22:39.674 --> 22:49.896
was their best friend.

22:51.091 --> 22:55.477
Two of my uncles, which were on my dad's side, were 
in the Navy with their best friend. So they knew how

22:55.958 --> 22:59.563
to operate a boat. They knew how to navigate. They 
knew which direction to go and all that. So we

23:04.610 --> 23:16.626
didn't have any trouble in that situation because 
we knew that all we had to do was just get a boat,

23:04.610 --> 23:16.626
escape so that nobody knew, and to get out in the 
open water and after that we knew that we would we

23:16.606 --> 23:40.302
would make it because uh we had three guys that are 
experienced in it and so uh

23:16.606 --> 23:40.302
we we planned and uh one night my mom told us to you 
know pack uh pack up and uh Well, the night before,

23:40.282 --> 23:42.184
actually. The night before, she told us that, you 
know, go to sleep early because you're going to be

23:42.204 --> 23:54.134
waking up real early in the morning around 4 or 3 or 
4, and we're going to go somewhere. So she didn't

23:54.254 --> 23:56.576
actually tell us where we were going. And so we 
thought it was real strange that, you know, why

23:57.057 --> 24:03.002
would we need to wake up so early? And so when we woke 
up at 3, three of us, my mom and one of my aunts, went

24:03.422 --> 24:10.288
to, take a taxi, kind of like a minibus, and we would 
go to the bus station, and the bus station would

24:10.268 --> 24:36.782
take us out in the country where the port was, and at 
the port, we would not go 24 people at a time, we

24:10.268 --> 24:36.782
would go like six people per group, so that all the 
group would be separately, but then at one certain

24:10.268 --> 24:36.782
time, time at a certain place everybody would meet 
and then they would we would all go to a canoe and we

24:37.353 --> 24:59.142
would roll to the main boat that we were gonna 
escape and then then we had to stay there a couple

24:37.353 --> 24:59.142
nights because uh in the boat yes in the boat uh 
under the fishing compartment because uh for one

24:59.830 --> 25:09.973
thing, the reason why we had to stay down there 
because the patrol boat would get suspicious if

24:59.830 --> 25:09.973
they would see so many people on the boat. So in 
other words, only the four men stayed up

25:09.993 --> 25:15.325
pretending that they were fishermen. And also, 
the reason why we stayed, because the owner that

25:15.305 --> 25:37.614
sold us the boat told us that he was going to help us 
get out into the open water because he knows which

25:15.305 --> 25:37.614
route to take so that we would see less of the patrol 
headquarters and all that. But bad for us is his

25:38.174 --> 25:44.282
boat caught in a low tide, and... he was caught, you 
know, to the bottom. And so his boat couldn't move,

25:48.113 --> 25:54.390
so he had to wait until the tide come back, you know, 
the high tide to come back in. And so we had to stay

25:54.893 --> 26:01.522
down there for two whole nights, just staying down 
there, staying real quiet. And at that time, it was

26:01.582 --> 26:08.972
the scariest moment for us because we were really 
an easy target for them to caught. I mean, if they

26:09.132 --> 26:13.177
catch us, they would see, they would caught us 
red-handed. And another thing that was the main

26:14.539 --> 26:21.508
thing was during the year that they were planning, 
My mom told us to go swimming in a swimming pool

26:22.248 --> 26:30.852
because in Vietnam we have open door swimming 
pool. And the reason why we wanted to do that is

26:30.872 --> 26:37.270
because the people in the country region they were 
all dark skinned because they worked out in the

26:37.250 --> 26:48.108
farm and they had really, their skin is really dark 
and they have a dark complexion. So that's why my

26:48.548 --> 27:03.713
mom wanted us to go down, to go to swim every day so 
that we would soak in the sun so that we would have a

26:48.548 --> 27:03.713
dark complexion so that they would not know that 
we, that they would not, the people would not know

27:03.693 --> 27:07.163
that we were from the city and coming down. So they 
thought that we would be one of the people that been

27:07.363 --> 27:13.320
here, that been in the country. So we did that. We 
all had dark skin, dark complexion. And so we just

27:18.695 --> 27:20.137
went. We waited two nights for them. And then after 
that, the next day, they took us out to the open

27:21.839 --> 27:28.728
water and went. Once we got out there, we didn't 
have any trouble. We just got out there. There was

27:32.493 --> 27:38.140
no stop, you know, no stop to stop or anything, no 
patrol boats or anything. So once we got out there,

27:38.440 --> 27:41.464
they just told us, okay, you're on your own. Good 
luck. you know, hope you good luck and all that. And

27:45.469 --> 27:47.011
so they waved us goodbye. Yeah, to the fishermen. 
They waved us goodbye and all that. And they went

27:50.716 --> 27:56.003
their own way and we were on our way out to the open 
water. Did you have any trouble in the open water?

27:58.847 --> 28:01.230
Any patrol boats? After you get out of the port, it 
would be international water. So the patrol, the

28:07.598 --> 28:11.263
communist patrol boat, they don't go out that far. 
They would stay around the outer region, and that

28:14.275 --> 28:17.959
would be it. So in other words, we were free. The 
only thing that would stop us is weather, and that

28:20.782 --> 28:36.019
was one of the main reasons because during that 
year that they were planning, they also had a plan

28:20.782 --> 28:36.019
at what time when what month they would have they 
would go because during the July and August season

28:35.999 --> 28:59.610
is where the typhoon season and unlucky for us we 
didn't know that so we chose that month to go and so

28:35.999 --> 28:59.610
it took us seven day in the open sea and the four the 
first The first day was really calm, but the next

28:59.590 --> 29:09.860
four days was just all thunderstorm, typhoon, and 
all that, the four days. And we thought that we

29:10.200 --> 29:19.208
would not make it because the boat was just going, 
the wave was just slapping the boat side by side,

29:10.200 --> 29:19.208
side by side, and all that. And in order for us to 
keep the boat from going over, from flipping over

29:26.455 --> 29:36.194
was a whole bunch of people had to go down to the 
fishing compartment to stay there so that the

29:26.455 --> 29:36.194
balance would be even. And in other words, in the 
cabin there would be Only three men and a

29:39.415 --> 29:51.229
couple of kids and my mom would stay in the cabin. 
One would navigate, one would steer the boat, and

29:51.909 --> 29:59.398
the other would feed the person that steered. And 
the kids that are in the cabin would lay down so that

29:59.918 --> 30:09.169
you want the boat to be evenly weight so that you 
would not have one weight on one side so that it

30:09.149 --> 30:13.456
would be so easy to flip over. So y'all were on rough 
waters. Rough water, real. Once we got out in the

30:20.388 --> 30:23.733
open water, everybody was down. I mean, we were all 
sick already right there because when, you know,

30:23.873 --> 30:34.431
at the part where you go from the port out in the open 
water, it's really a lot of waves, and... The boat

30:34.968 --> 30:43.300
was shaking already right there, and so we were not 
used to it yet because I, for one, have not even

30:34.968 --> 30:43.300
stepped on a boat before. So we got sick right 
there, right away. So actually, only the last two

30:46.144 --> 30:53.074
days were the days that we were really fine. 
Otherwise, all the other days, we were gone. Okay,

30:55.478 --> 30:58.242
where did you go from... from there outside of the 
port? I went from the port. We went all the way to to

31:07.469 --> 31:09.150
the main Thailand. The main Thailand had little 
beachfront that so many refugees had escaped that

31:09.731 --> 31:26.065
they would just, when their boat was in emergency, 
like they had a hold, they would just dump their

31:09.731 --> 31:26.065
boat right on the shore. And they would just say, 
ha, this is where the place we're going to stay. And

31:29.308 --> 31:33.432
so many people did that, that it became a refugee 
camp. And so all along the Thailand coast, shore

31:37.490 --> 32:00.949
this all along the thailand mainland were just 
little camps everywhere that were refugees that

31:37.490 --> 32:00.949
were from escape and the majority of them were 
vietnamese that escaped because we went a year

31:37.490 --> 32:00.949
late so by the time we got there by the time that we 
got to the refuge camp that we stayed it was a really

31:37.490 --> 32:00.949
well established had more more than a hundred 
people already there you know waiting for them to

32:01.182 --> 32:29.839
be sponsored and all that so i went straight into 
one of these records uh yes we went straight into uh

32:01.182 --> 32:29.839
straight into it yeah and what happened there were 
you processed through or well at that time they the

32:01.182 --> 32:29.839
thailand government were really lenient they 
knew that a lot of people were going to do this so

32:01.182 --> 32:29.839
they would accept all the refugees to come in and 
for them to live in the camp, you know. And then we

32:37.312 --> 32:46.968
would have to give them paper, tell them what 
country we prefer to be sponsored to go to and all

32:37.312 --> 32:46.968
that. And then they would give our name to the one of 
the ambassadors of that country and he would have a

32:51.115 --> 33:00.282
list and every day, every day around around 10 
a.m., there would be guys from other countries,

33:00.785 --> 33:11.142
Canada, France, United States, West Germany, and 
all that. They would come, and they would read out

33:11.182 --> 33:17.873
their list, which one was appropriate for them to 
go. And so at that time, every day at 10, everybody

33:17.913 --> 33:25.486
would be real crowded in the front gate so that they 
would hear their name. And after they hear their

33:25.686 --> 33:27.349
name, they would have to pack and then at the end of 
the week there would be a bus to come and pick them

33:27.329 --> 33:36.960
up. And usually it would be every other week there 
would be like around 50 people. No, no, it would be

33:44.829 --> 33:50.055
around 25 people would get picked. And they would 
go to the bus and they would get transferred into

33:50.075 --> 33:57.083
the capital city of Thailand, which is Bangkok. 
And they would stay there for a couple more months

33:57.704 --> 34:07.258
for the process of the actual going to whatever 
country you wanted to go. How long were y'all in

34:08.521 --> 34:13.369
there? After we stayed in the refugee camps a 
couple days later, my mom was busy writing letters

34:13.889 --> 34:23.685
to my aunt over in Canada. My aunt in Canada, she 
lived there for 14 years. She went to school there,

34:27.511 --> 34:32.098
and she got married there, and she decided to stay 
there. My mom contacted her for money, and then my

34:32.078 --> 34:49.195
mom also contacted a couple of my dad's real good 
friends that he met while he was over in the United

34:32.078 --> 34:49.195
States in 72. And so she would contact them also to 
tell them that we are over here already, that we are

34:50.557 --> 35:01.748
waiting, and if there's any way they can help us. 
you know, please do, and all that. And so, a couple

35:03.250 --> 35:27.278
days later, my aunt would send us money for food and 
all that, and then one of my dad's friends actually

35:03.250 --> 35:27.278
went down to the island, to our place, and he would 
talk to my mom, and he would say that, you know,

35:03.250 --> 35:27.278
don't worry, we're going to get you out of here as 
soon as possible. And, uh, At the end of the month,

35:28.947 --> 35:31.190
we were gone. We were in the list. You left the 
refugee camps. Yes. So actually, we stayed at the

35:36.258 --> 35:39.883
refugee camps only one month. And after that, we 
left to Bangkok, and we stayed there. And the

35:44.450 --> 35:51.681
reason why we stayed there three months at the 
Bangkok place, the reason why we had to stay so long

35:51.661 --> 36:03.296
The reason why we had to stay so long was because we 
had to do some physical examination and see if you

35:51.661 --> 36:03.296
had any disease and a vaccination and all that. 
Just take care of yourself and all that. And the

36:06.380 --> 36:13.770
place that we were living in were an abandoned 
penitentiary. It was a really big penitentiary.

36:16.723 --> 36:19.149
And when we got there, it was really dirty. And 
there were a whole bunch of people that were

36:19.670 --> 36:27.912
already there waiting to be picked up. Everywhere 
you go, when you got there, you had to go and find

36:29.073 --> 36:35.145
yourself a place to live. So my mom and I, we would go 
down the court, go down the hall, and check out

36:35.967 --> 36:43.261
where we would go. And there would be these cells 
that have bar doors. There would be people

36:48.091 --> 36:51.515
actually living in there, and it was really dirty. 
They didn't have any bed. They had to sleep down on

36:52.517 --> 36:53.818
the floor. They provided you mattresses, but no 
bed frame. So you actually just put the mattresses

36:58.244 --> 37:03.491
on the floor, and you would just sleep there. And so 
my mom decided for us not to live in one of those

37:03.511 --> 37:10.860
cells, because there would not be air 
circulating, so that it would be real bad for us. So

37:11.340 --> 37:14.925
what we did was we lived under a staircase. so that 
there would be air circulating and all that. And so

37:19.667 --> 37:22.954
we stayed there three months, and then we got on the 
list. We had all our physical examination was off.

37:29.046 --> 37:29.787
We're all fine. So we were accepted to go. Where 
were you going to? We were going to the United

37:36.100 --> 37:46.574
States because my mom did not want to go to Canada 
because, for one thing, it was really cold over

37:36.100 --> 37:46.574
there. So she wanted us to go to the United States. 
And also, we had a relative that already left in

37:52.001 --> 37:58.429
1970. that she was already there. In fact, she was 
my dad's oldest sister, and her family were all

38:01.115 --> 38:07.610
over there. She was established in America. Yeah, 
she was already established. So we asked her if she

38:11.479 --> 38:16.570
could sponsor us, and she agreed. you had the main 
thing is the two main thing is you had to have a

38:17.107 --> 38:46.253
sponsor and you have your physical examination 
have to be good in order for you to be on the list and

38:17.107 --> 38:46.253
we didn't waste any time even though three months 
was was very long but we waited and uh we got on the

38:17.107 --> 38:46.253
list a bus came by took us and uh at this time when the 
whenever the bus come they would pick up a hundred

38:17.107 --> 38:46.253
people instead of only 25 because That place in 
Bangkok was just packed. It was just loaded of

38:50.138 --> 38:51.600
people. There were no places to stay. There were 
actually people living out in the hall that you can

38:53.843 --> 39:01.533
barely walk through it. And so they would pick up at 
least 100 people every week. And those 100 people

39:07.040 --> 39:11.566
would go to a certain place that they wanted to go. 
So it took us a couple hours to go to the airport. We

39:15.411 --> 39:18.055
got on the plane, and we flew to France. And we 
stopped there for fuel, refuel, and then we flew

39:18.576 --> 39:22.401
straight to Houston. And my aunt came and picked us 
up. Where does your aunt live? Where does she live?

39:31.333 --> 39:32.895
My aunt lives in Houston. So y'all went to live in 
Houston? Yes. We went to live with her for a couple

39:36.754 --> 39:40.861
weeks. And then we finally found... Well, she had a 
sponsor when she came over. And so what she did was

39:47.531 --> 39:56.024
she asked her sponsor if it was okay if that couple 
could be our sponsor. And that couple is a... old

39:58.863 --> 40:01.887
couple, American, an old American couple. They 
were really nice and they were really willing and

40:02.468 --> 40:07.835
happy to accept us, you know, as sponsor. And they 
took care of us. They brought us clothes, food, and

40:09.758 --> 40:19.251
found us an affordable apartment so that we could 
move out because My mom wanted us to start out by

40:19.535 --> 40:26.692
ourselves, so we only stayed with my aunt for two 
weeks, and then we were gone. We went to an

40:27.053 --> 40:29.759
apartment that we rented. So you've lived in 
Houston ever since? Yes, we live in Houston ever

40:34.090 --> 40:36.295
since. Okay, what is the status with your father? 
He didn't get out after those five years? Okay,

40:42.655 --> 41:01.084
when we got out and when we were still over here and 
it went past five years and my grandmother quickly

40:42.655 --> 41:01.084
contacted us because she knew that my mom would be 
really you know, gone berserk. So she contacted us

41:03.481 --> 41:17.233
and she said that there's something wrong, you 
know, that there seems like they're keeping the

41:03.481 --> 41:17.233
officers for a longer time because my uncle, I had 
one other uncle that was also went to

41:17.433 --> 41:19.358
concentration camp. And he stayed for only three 
years. And he got out. Was he an officer? He was a

41:25.253 --> 41:26.637
sergeant. So you had to be a really high commanding 
officer for you to be staying longer than that.

41:33.093 --> 41:43.468
Also, she said that all the other relatives have 
sons that were released, but she said that there

41:33.093 --> 41:43.468
were no high commanding officers that were 
released yet. My mom had a couple of friends that

41:44.169 --> 41:50.578
decided to stay back. instead because they wanted 
to wait for their husband because their husband

41:50.828 --> 42:15.047
because they would said that it would take only 
five years so that's not long so i'll stay and so uh

41:50.828 --> 42:15.047
her friends would come to my grandmother and would 
cry and would go you know would ask all these

41:50.828 --> 42:15.047
questions you know why why is it taking so long and 
all that how long and now they're gonna they

41:50.828 --> 42:15.047
started asking question how long Are they going to 
be kept in concentration camp? Is it going to be

42:19.206 --> 42:20.349
forever? Or when are they going to get released and 
all that? And my mom wrote back to my grandmother

42:26.762 --> 42:33.696
and said that, OK, we're doing real fine over here. 
So just keep going. just keep me updated on what's

42:37.235 --> 42:40.440
going on and all that. So my grandmother would tell 
us that everybody is just going berserk.

42:44.828 --> 42:53.682
Everybody's going to their neighbor asking if 
their husband or their sons have been released yet

42:44.828 --> 42:53.682
or did they get any letters from them yet. And then 
they would go to the headquarters and complain

42:54.103 --> 42:56.968
about it. They would say that, you know, they 
wouldn't say that it's five years and how come

42:57.288 --> 43:03.158
they're not out, but they would say, you know, How 
long are y'all going to plan to keep them and all

43:03.138 --> 43:06.622
that? And so they say that they don't know and all 
that. It's up to the head honcho and all that. Were

43:12.829 --> 43:16.012
you in any contact with your father this time? 
During that time, the contact was very little.

43:19.296 --> 43:25.322
During that time, we would receive a letter per two 
months, two months or less. So in other words, we

43:25.342 --> 43:29.567
received only six letters a whole year. But 
actually, we did not receive my dad's letter. My

43:34.636 --> 43:45.295
dad mailed it to my grandmother, and my 
grandmother would go to my aunt, and my aunt would

43:34.636 --> 43:45.295
go down to us, my aunt from Canada, because 
somehow, I don't know what it is, but somehow the

43:45.275 --> 43:54.848
mail seems to circulate faster if you go that way. 
Because I have no idea why, but that's how we... At

43:55.349 --> 44:02.318
the first time, at the beginning, we did that. But 
then later on, we mailed straight from Vietnam all

44:02.859 --> 44:12.312
the way down to Houston, which when we opened the 
letter, we would read, you know, It was in June, and

44:12.764 --> 44:17.109
we would receive it all the way until September. So 
it would take around three months for the letter to

44:17.770 --> 44:21.314
arrive. Well, anyway, the wives were getting 
really crazy. They were getting worried. Now they

44:27.420 --> 44:41.556
were getting worried that if they would ever had a 
chance to escape because later on there were less

44:27.420 --> 44:41.556
and less people escaping because there were 
bandits. out in the open sea. They knew that there

44:43.516 --> 44:47.385
were refugees going to escape. So they knew that. 
So they were waiting out there so that if they see

44:48.608 --> 44:53.098
any boat, they would come and they would take the 
valuables, rape the women, and take all the food

44:53.534 --> 45:01.244
and all that. So if you waited around for your 
husband to be released, you didn't have much money

45:01.825 --> 45:09.695
to leave after that. Actually, those wives that 
had their husbands that were still in the past five

45:09.715 --> 45:20.149
years, they they just forget about the escape 
because they knew that there was just no way

45:20.129 --> 45:31.000
because it was just way too late now for them to 
escape.
