WEBVTT

00:01.938 --> 00:23.710
time phases because you see I have to consider four 
years before the war and then I have to consider one

00:01.938 --> 00:23.710
term and one summer after the war and

00:01.938 --> 00:23.710
before the war

00:29.545 --> 00:31.888
I had a physics instructor named Veazey.

00:35.273 --> 00:37.196
I think it was D.D. Veazey. I'm not sure. That

00:39.299 --> 00:53.680
probably influenced

00:39.299 --> 00:53.680
me to continue and

00:39.299 --> 00:53.680
work in the engineering field.

01:00.275 --> 01:21.227
After

01:00.275 --> 01:21.227
the war, I

01:00.275 --> 01:21.227
guess Spencer J. Buchanan had more

01:00.275 --> 01:21.227
effect on my schooling than anybody else.

01:25.073 --> 01:26.856
He was in the Civil Engineering Department. I 
guess he's a part-time instructor, if at all, now.

01:36.498 --> 01:44.551
Buchanan, Burkhart & Associates has a 
geotechnical engineering firm in downtown

01:36.498 --> 01:44.551
Bryan. Mr.

01:44.571 --> 01:54.868
Sandstett had a civil engineering department 
before the war.

01:58.882 --> 02:02.868
was quite influential. How did these men 
influence you? By being willing and actually

02:06.814 --> 02:19.935
giving more of their time than just what took place 
between the bells. And showing a sincere effort in

02:19.955 --> 02:24.602
your welfare, What's going on? How are you doing in 
other studies? Things like that.

02:35.514 --> 02:36.995
It's too easy to get into that. The bell starts, the 
class starts, and when the bell rings, it's over,

02:38.437 --> 02:51.872
and turn your papers in, and when you come back, all 
the papers are spread across the desk, and find

02:38.437 --> 02:51.872
your own paper, and that's your grade.

02:57.775 --> 03:12.951
I guess it's back to

02:57.775 --> 03:12.951
what I have always tried to teach to my 
subordinates as well as to my two sons. Everybody

03:12.971 --> 03:14.352
is a human being. They deserve to be treated like 
one. And you can't treat everybody the same way.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.643
Even if you're in a... college or university, I 
don't care whether you've got 2,000 students or

03:26.918 --> 03:56.215
32,000 students, the minute you start turning the 
crank and trying to treat everybody the same way,

03:26.918 --> 03:56.215
well, it's going to lose its personality, it's 
going to lose its character, and these men are not

03:26.918 --> 03:56.215
that

03:26.918 --> 03:56.215
type. I had

03:58.677 --> 04:11.192
a math instructor by the name of Halperin

03:58.677 --> 04:11.192
that, of course, I'll never forget. But I don't 
know that he was a great influence on my life. But he

04:17.180 --> 04:21.145
was by the name of Halperin. You can figure

04:21.165 --> 04:26.151
that he's probably German. But he was a calculus 
instructor. He could start writing across the

04:28.698 --> 04:33.343
board, and he could write till the end of the 
period. And he seemed to have eyes in the back of his

04:33.363 --> 04:41.673
head because we had these three benches. They had a 
bench with three seats. Each bench had three arms

04:44.616 --> 04:46.839
coming up. And he seemed to know every time I get my 
feet up on the bench in front without ever turning

04:47.820 --> 04:56.089
around, Mr. Johnson, take your feet down. I could 
never find the mirror. I could never find a third

04:58.916 --> 05:01.581
eye. I could never figure out where it was coming. I

05:03.945 --> 05:12.479
remember one time after he told me twice, Mr. 
Johnson, take your feet down. The third time he

05:12.539 --> 05:16.045
turned around and he hit me right in the head with a 
piece of chalk. But I could never figure out how he

05:16.065 --> 05:20.052
knew that my feet were up there.

05:24.149 --> 05:29.159
Did you think that A&M prepared you well to be an 
engineer? Oh, yes. I think that back in that day

05:30.001 --> 05:44.571
that was agricultural and engineering was 
definitely the long arm of A&M.

05:48.719 --> 05:51.982
Hopefully some of the other schools at A&M. I'm 
talking about some of the other departments have

05:52.243 --> 05:55.085
gotten stronger. But agriculture and 
engineering were definitely the long arms. I

06:01.712 --> 06:09.320
think since then there have been a number of other 
colleges and universities come up and approach

06:01.712 --> 06:09.320
them. I would never say that

06:09.340 --> 06:18.169
it was on top unless maybe the petroleum school at 
one time was and maybe it is now but i i don't just

06:19.162 --> 06:43.262
because i finished there i don't say that it was the 
number one engineering school in any particular

06:19.162 --> 06:43.262
discipline of engineering but you thought felt 
well prepared

06:44.963 --> 06:47.827
Do you think that A&M changed your life? Do you 
think that going there versus going to some other

06:47.847 --> 06:53.434
school made a difference in your career? Oh, very 
good. Very good. Would you explain? Well, I don't

06:59.521 --> 07:08.372
think that

06:59.521 --> 07:08.372
I would ever have

07:16.958 --> 07:33.163
embarked on a military career by

07:16.958 --> 07:33.163
going to someplace like where my other buddies 
went, Rice or Sam Houston, either one.

07:37.549 --> 07:42.477
Because rightfully or wrongfully, even though 
One of them did come out as a colonel in the Marine

07:43.655 --> 07:48.079
Corps.

07:50.821 --> 08:12.160
I

07:50.821 --> 08:12.160
believe that in the military that

07:50.821 --> 08:12.160
the individual is an officer first, and then 
whatever else he is, next. be it engineer, supply

08:13.304 --> 08:37.084
man, or what, that if he's not the officer,

08:13.304 --> 08:37.084
then

08:13.304 --> 08:37.084
he's not going to attain that top level. I don't 
care whether it's top staff or commander or the top

08:40.857 --> 08:50.569
manager or what.

08:50.589 --> 09:02.504
I guess the best way I can explain it is I've had too 
many engineers come to me and say, hey,

08:50.589 --> 09:02.504
I don't want to be a manager of engineers. I want to 
be an engineer manager.

09:09.515 --> 09:10.096
Okay. You don't want to be the top man.

09:17.445 --> 09:24.254
Then you realize you're drawing a line for 
yourself and you're not going to get above this

09:17.445 --> 09:24.254
line. And it's probably Lieutenant Colonel. 
You're never going to get above Lieutenant

09:27.738 --> 09:32.084
Colonel.

09:32.104 --> 09:36.750
And you'll be lucky if you get that high.

09:36.770 --> 09:36.990
Well, I don't know. I just want to practice 
engineering. I said, okay. If that's all you want

09:41.733 --> 09:43.915
to do is just practice engineering.

09:47.098 --> 09:52.564
And I'm not belittling you because I happen to be an 
engineer myself and profess to be an engineer.

09:52.844 --> 09:59.290
I've got a ticket hanging on the wall that says I am 
one because I'm a professional engineer, a

09:52.844 --> 09:59.290
registered engineer. But we can buy them for a dime 
a dozen. We can't buy the manager of engineers

10:05.894 --> 10:18.854
for down-to-date.

10:18.894 --> 10:26.546
And I'm sure had I gone to Rice, I would have been a 
hell of a lot smarter civil engineer. But I don't

10:26.566 --> 10:30.973
think I would have been any better off in any way 
than the manager. Some people say that, most or a

10:31.763 --> 10:43.460
lot of people say that A&M is more than just an 
institution of higher learning, that there's

10:31.763 --> 10:43.460
something special, that it's sort of unique. 
Would you agree with that? Well, I used the term a

10:46.545 --> 10:47.847
while ago. It's a living laboratory that the other 
places don't have. Because I'm sure, you know,

10:54.376 --> 11:00.285
I've been to, well, let's take summer school. Even 
summer school at A&M is a different life than core

11:01.261 --> 11:16.003
life, and probably a different life than 
long-term life during the regular school. And you

11:16.865 --> 11:23.315
may or may not know those people who are living 
right next door.

11:24.356 --> 11:30.205
And that's too often the case at other schools in 
the dormitories Classes are mixed, freshman,

11:30.607 --> 11:34.613
sophomore, juniors. You don't know who they are 
and what they are. You go your way and I go mine.

11:43.025 --> 11:49.374
Like too many communities in other parts of the 
world, other parts of the United States. What

11:49.394 --> 11:50.936
about this idea of spirit?

11:55.162 --> 11:59.128
Yeah, it's a hard thing to define.

12:07.647 --> 12:08.308
It's there.

12:13.155 --> 12:27.035
Sometimes I

12:13.155 --> 12:27.035
get a feeling that we

12:13.155 --> 12:27.035
attribute too much to it. We get emotionally 
unstable.

12:41.195 --> 13:03.364
some of the athletic contests where A&M has 
absolutely no chance of winning and yet the spirit

12:41.195 --> 13:03.364
will move a whole group of people and they'll feel 
that they've been mistreated if they didn't end up

12:41.195 --> 13:03.364
winning. They

13:03.464 --> 13:08.350
lose all sense of objectivity, but a spirit taking 
over, you know. That's where it works against you.

13:16.554 --> 13:19.477
It can also work for you, but...

13:26.144 --> 13:33.291
I'm of the school that believes in spirit and 
tradition getting in there together, but

13:26.144 --> 13:33.291
tradition is only... worthwhile so long as it 
serves for the body that established it and

13:34.503 --> 13:41.594
maintained it. When it starts going against it, 
then that's the time to get rid of it. So do you think

13:44.879 --> 13:57.118
there's a tradition of A&M or some of the spirit 
that should be taught, drawn along?

14:06.008 --> 14:18.882
Sometimes I look at some and think that we're...

14:18.982 --> 14:32.617
I wonder what they're serving,

14:18.982 --> 14:32.617
and yet I can rationalize with myself and say, 
well,

14:18.982 --> 14:32.617
you haven't been there so long. For example? Yeah, 
the...

14:40.163 --> 14:41.544
We'll have to find the word. The grooming, the 
adding,

14:41.684 --> 15:10.170
the things that the yell leaders go through to the

14:41.684 --> 15:10.170
public, all that make them look absolutely 
stupid.

15:11.551 --> 15:18.198
to the way they walk, the way they carry their 
shoulders, some of the movements. What in the hell

15:18.678 --> 15:22.002
is wrong with those guys? And

15:22.322 --> 15:30.371
yet I can't say that's wrong. And we did it 50 years 
ago.

15:35.115 --> 15:36.297
But what does it do? To me, I say now, what does it do? 
Does it make a guy yell louder? Does it set him off

15:41.318 --> 15:55.180
as, I am the leader, stay with me?

15:55.321 --> 15:56.923
That's little. That's trite. Really what we're 
searching to concentrate on is large things that

15:58.906 --> 16:06.178
are that are hurting us. I don't know that there

16:11.130 --> 16:28.709
are, but I hate people to be in, I'm not going to use 
the word leadership, but yet the Yale leader is, by

16:11.130 --> 16:28.709
the title, he's in a position of leadership. Yet 
sometimes he looks absolutely asinine. He looks

16:30.531 --> 16:33.634
stupid.

16:43.098 --> 16:45.621
Let's start on your military career. Or is there 
something else you want to say about A&M before we

16:45.641 --> 16:51.749
move on to your military career when you were 
commissioned in 1941? Well,

16:51.889 --> 17:00.020
it's currently whether we take it in two sections. 
Well, we can come back. I mean, if we say, yeah, my

17:01.762 --> 17:06.208
military career was like my college career. It was 
split. Yeah. Sure, we can come back. Were you happy

17:11.414 --> 17:15.638
when you received your commission, or would you 
have rather stayed at A&M and finished? No, I was

17:15.978 --> 17:17.600
happy. You were ready to leave? Well, caught up 
with the group, I was like everybody else. If the

17:24.927 --> 17:28.210
group's going, I want to go. Even though you asked 
for a deferment? Yeah, the college automatically

17:30.172 --> 17:33.955
asked for a deferment for all of us. Oh, I see. You 
did not personally. I wanted it. I didn't tell the

17:36.578 --> 17:41.202
college, don't ask for it. Before we

17:42.515 --> 17:59.854
get into the service,

17:42.515 --> 17:59.854
are you a former student? How long have you been 
there and how much do you know about life in the

18:00.614 --> 18:04.919
Corps? Well, I know a lot because I've talked to a 
lot of generals. Back when I was in school, the

18:12.350 --> 18:19.517
Corps wasn't much larger than it is now, maybe 
about twice the size. And daily, we'd have a cadet

18:19.537 --> 18:24.502
officer of the day and a cadet officer of the guard. 
And they were always under arms, under saber.

18:32.511 --> 18:41.800
And during the spring,

18:32.511 --> 18:41.800
each regiment would have its own ball on a Friday 
night. the following night there would be a core

18:42.640 --> 18:47.547
dance, which would be open to the entire school. 
And as each regiment had its

18:47.567 --> 19:02.149
festivities, it would have a parade on the drill 
ground, just a regimental parade. And it was up to

19:02.169 --> 19:07.838
the OD and the OG to be sure that The conduct was 
maintained and the dress was maintained. People

19:12.364 --> 19:17.890
just didn't come around the parade dressed like 
everybody because it had an awful lot of visitors

19:12.364 --> 19:17.890
at each regimental parade. And

19:19.232 --> 19:30.724
the composite regiment was made up of the chem 
warfare and the signal corps. And at the weekend

19:30.744 --> 19:35.850
that they had their parade involved, I was 
introduced to a young lady that you met at the door

19:36.421 --> 19:41.470
down. And she was there as a date with someone else. 
And then, of course, a member of the Combined

19:46.479 --> 19:50.887
Regiment. He's Kim Walker, actually. And that 
night, well, the OD and the OG, no matter what

19:53.291 --> 19:59.863
regiment they belong to, they go and One of them is 
always under saber and the other one could go out

20:00.248 --> 20:08.157
and dance or socialize and then come back and 
relieve the other one. But one of them was always

20:08.177 --> 20:09.899
under saber. He was the cadet in charge at that 
function. So I danced with her that night whenever

20:16.327 --> 20:21.432
I could. And then the next day, the same people that 
introduced me to her said, wouldn't you eat lunch

20:28.531 --> 20:31.614
with her since her date is a table waiter? And I 
said, yes, I'd enjoy it. Then I was off duty.

20:38.542 --> 20:40.283
Somebody else was the OD and the OD. Well, I had such 
an enjoyable time eating lunch with her that I came

20:41.285 --> 20:50.414
right back to the battery, and I called all the 
freshmen and the sophomore for the battery

20:41.285 --> 20:50.414
together. And I said, who all is going to the dance 
tonight? Dismissed. Dismissed. Who wants to go to

20:56.000 --> 20:57.762
the dance tonight? And I picked one freshman and 
one sophomore.

21:04.028 --> 21:05.389
First, I said, who's got tucks? One, you, and you. 
OK. So the game is late. The freshmen cannot cut in

21:16.940 --> 21:20.724
on seniors. Sophomore can. Saturday night, she 
danced with one freshman, one sophomore, and me,

21:22.706 --> 21:28.812
and not with her own team. Well, it didn't take but 
about three months, and then we went through the

21:29.635 --> 21:41.586
ring, and we were engaged by the time when the 
commission came along, and married very shortly

21:29.635 --> 21:41.586
thereafter. So that was 1941, then? Yep, that's 
1941. And where's your wife from? Is she from

21:46.751 --> 21:47.952
Bryan, then? She's from Missouri City, Texas, 
which is a little town. By Houston. Yep, just west

21:52.316 --> 21:53.797
of Houston. Now, it wasn't as large as it is now. 
They measured populations like 36, 37. And she

21:59.302 --> 22:04.049
came up to A&M for the dance? For the regimental 
ball. So then you got married and went? October.

22:11.299 --> 22:11.960
October of 41. Went on active duty in July and 
married in October. OK, let's start talking about

22:16.507 --> 22:20.592
your active duty. You send me just one sheet here on 
your military career. OK, my senior year. The Army

22:30.436 --> 22:45.238
Air Corps came into all the engineering schools

22:30.436 --> 22:45.238
enticing engineering students to put in transfer 
to the Army Air Corps. They could see a buildup and

22:45.258 --> 22:48.363
they could see a need of engineers. And I put in for a 
transfer to the Army Air Corps. But when

22:55.259 --> 23:00.585
commissioning came along, those things had not 
come through, so I was commissioned in the field

22:55.259 --> 23:00.585
artillery. I had orders to go to

23:02.427 --> 23:14.181
Fort Bliss and then go to Fort Sill to go to the 
artillery school. That's where all the others

23:14.582 --> 23:18.927
went, like Becker and all that stuff. Okay, but I 
was still wondering about this other piece of

23:18.947 --> 23:24.253
paper. So I came over here to Fort Sam, started 
running it down, and they said, well, it's still

23:25.027 --> 23:38.040
pending, and as far as we know, you're still going 
to go to Bliss, and then you'll go on up to Sill. And

23:38.060 --> 23:41.403
we're going to issue you a set of orders. So they 
did. And I got my foot marker back and everything,

23:44.226 --> 23:51.253
and I was getting ready to head out to El Paso, 
living in Houston at that time. all of a sudden the

23:52.043 --> 24:19.975
wire came in and transferred to the air corps 
reserve non-rated and headed to brookly field

23:52.043 --> 24:19.975
mobile alabama so they're just the same number of 
miles but in the opposite direction so i got over

23:52.043 --> 24:19.975
there and i was about the 16th officer to report to 
this brand new base and it was still being

23:52.043 --> 24:19.975
constructed i mean we were in mud up to here and 
really yeah and uh As often as I have found the

24:22.013 --> 24:30.042
ingenuities of the service, they didn't need 
engineers over there at that time. But they needed

24:30.342 --> 24:32.604
administrative officers. So they sent me off to 
the Adjutant General School up in Washington, DC.

24:37.970 --> 24:38.851
As soon as you got there? Well, very shortly. I was 
up there at the time. No, December 41. Yeah,

24:43.516 --> 24:44.817
December 41. I was in Washington on 7 December. 
Tell me about that. We had gotten married. And

24:53.037 --> 25:01.065
do you, by chance, know a man around College 
Station, Lucian Morgan? OK. He's in the insurance

25:03.388 --> 25:05.270
business. And he lived out south side of College 
Station. But he was one of the students. He was the

25:12.177 --> 25:13.818
first lieutenant at the school. And I was the 
second lieutenant.

25:17.822 --> 25:19.324
My wife had come up. Lucian and another lieutenant 
named Johnson and myself were up actually

25:20.030 --> 25:27.698
visiting the Gettysburg battlefield on that 
Sunday. We stopped at a little cafe to get

25:28.679 --> 25:31.141
something to eat. We walked in and there wasn't 
anyone in the cafe. Nobody behind a counter,

25:34.825 --> 25:38.869
nobody behind a cash register, nobody sitting at 
the table. We sat down and then all of a sudden we

25:39.970 --> 25:45.295
heard coming from the kitchen this radio 
broadcast. Well, the three of the men, we cleared

25:46.473 --> 25:52.381
the counter and went into the kitchen, and that's 
where we heard of the bombing. On the way back...

25:53.823 --> 25:55.785
What were your thoughts? Oh, what does someone 
think? I don't know what our thoughts really were.

26:02.394 --> 26:05.678
We knew it was coming sooner or later, but had no 
idea it was coming on that side. Everybody was

26:06.059 --> 26:07.461
looking toward Europe. You thought the Germans 
would attack before the Japanese? Yeah, sure. So

26:14.148 --> 26:20.356
on the way back from Gettysburg to the cantonment 
where the school is, we had to come right by the

26:14.148 --> 26:20.356
Japanese embassy. And as we came by, you could see 
the flames on the inner court burning up over the

26:20.376 --> 26:26.463
top of the building. They were just burning 
everything they could get their hands on that

26:26.483 --> 26:29.607
night. All their documents? Yeah, all their 
stuff. Were there any Americans outside

26:33.451 --> 26:35.794
protesting? No, the police had things pretty well 
under control, keeping people away. Was

26:42.515 --> 26:49.303
Washington congested, or was there a lot of 
people, or was it confusion? Yeah, a little

26:49.764 --> 26:59.176
confusion, and of course, the military 
department still worked in uniforms. It was one of

26:59.196 --> 27:03.801
these one-day-a-week deal of wearing uniforms. 
To see some of the Navy boys turn out in December in

27:03.861 --> 27:09.448
whites looked pretty cold. Yeah. That's all they 
had was white. They managed to get by for years

27:13.080 --> 27:17.506
without having a wardrobe uniform. So they were 
civilian clothes. Well, our school was cut short

27:21.090 --> 27:25.595
by a couple of weeks. All of us that had leave, the 
leaves were canceled. And we all had to go right

27:28.118 --> 27:35.007
back to duty stations instead of go home for 
Christmas and so on. And that was probably the

27:35.027 --> 27:38.731
greatest hardship. By the time we got back to 
Mobile, There were enough people that had come in

27:42.556 --> 27:47.964
in the six weeks and had filled up all of the 
apartments in town. And it pushed us out to an area

27:48.064 --> 27:56.256
called Hollinger Island, south of Mobile. And all 
that was out there were summer cottages, single

27:56.977 --> 28:02.085
frame, single floor. No sheetrock walls, no walls 
at all, except just the outside wall. It was pretty

28:07.072 --> 28:08.554
cool. But we managed to make it. We made some 
friendships there. And what did the Air Force have

28:14.905 --> 28:17.909
you do? What was your duty there? When I reported 
in, I became the assistant base adjutant.

28:26.439 --> 28:28.661
Because, again, they didn't need engineers. And 
then they sent me off to the Adjutant General

28:28.902 --> 28:34.748
School, which even strengthened that you're 
going to be an administrative officer. So

28:34.949 --> 28:42.077
when I came back, I went back to the job. as 
assistant base adjutant for just a couple of weeks

28:42.867 --> 28:59.323
because then we started activating what was known 
as air depot groups. Air depot group is an

29:00.424 --> 29:09.313
organization that does second and third echelon 
supply and maintenance in the Air Corps. It goes

29:10.154 --> 29:21.114
and sets up and operates as a depot just as, you 
might say, like Kelly does here or like Tinker does

29:10.154 --> 29:21.114
up in Oklahoma. Aircraft are brought into it for 
modifications and repair and so on. It can't be

29:24.740 --> 29:26.744
done down at the unit level.

29:29.829 --> 29:33.175
There were already some in existence in Georgia. 
So a team of us went over and spent some time with

29:33.847 --> 29:40.434
them to see how they operated and how they were 
farmed and so on. Then came back to Mobile, uh,

29:40.454 --> 29:46.980
Brooklyn and started farming these air depot 
groups. And the first one that was farmed was the

29:47.001 --> 29:50.844
seventh air depot group. And, uh, I became the 
commanding officer of the headquarters squadron

29:50.864 --> 30:03.077
and, uh, we had supply squadron and repair 
squadron and we had quartermaster truck company

30:05.268 --> 30:16.761
and a chemical warfare platoon and a bunch of 
attached units. We were fortunate because being

30:17.422 --> 30:34.701
the first one formed, because as these people came 
in from the different training schools and came in

30:17.422 --> 30:34.701
and went into the personnel pool, we had first grab 
at them. and actually took the best qualified that

30:35.390 --> 30:48.525
we could to our own outfit, and then the 24th and the 
25th was farm and so on, and so we had what we thought

30:35.390 --> 30:48.525
was a pretty good outfit. About how many men?

30:52.610 --> 30:55.072
A group had right at 1,200 men. I had about 160 men in 
the headquarters squadron, and plus the...

31:03.672 --> 31:06.938
quartermaster and the Kim Warfares were attached 
to me. I had three at that time. I was first and I had

31:09.963 --> 31:13.750
three second lieutenant subordinate. All three 
of them were ROTC graduate. One of them was a pilot

31:19.060 --> 31:26.473
and his job when we set up he would be the base 
operations officer. He would control the flight

31:28.983 --> 31:30.905
line. And within our squadron were the people that 
worked for him. And the headquarters commander

31:36.152 --> 31:43.321
was also the director of personnel for the entire 
group. So I knew the personnel man. We had some cute

31:46.345 --> 31:48.347
things happen. We had probably the best engineer 
officer that ever walked in the Air Corps and the

31:57.149 --> 31:59.553
Air Force named Kroeber. And he was the commanding 
officer of the repair squadron. He was a captain

32:06.305 --> 32:16.162
when we got ready to leave and they came down and 
just picked him out because he was German born,

32:06.305 --> 32:16.162
German trained, military, everything. And he was 
a classmate of some of the higher people in

32:16.182 --> 32:22.633
Germany. No way. You're not going to Europe. You 
may go to the Pacific, but you're not going to

32:25.149 --> 32:28.113
Europe. Or leave him in command and put somebody 
else in there. What did you think about that? Well,

32:32.300 --> 32:40.552
we all hated to see it because by then we had 
established a pretty good outfit.

32:43.456 --> 32:47.883
He was a captain, Captain Honeycutt, commander of 
the supply squadron. They go by Huntsville now.

32:51.622 --> 32:57.911
All three of us had what we thought were 
crackerjack squadrons, and we had a good outfit.

32:57.931 --> 33:04.842
Anything that happened to it, well, you know, I 
just

32:57.931 --> 33:04.842
don't really know what to think about. But then the 
longer you were away from it and you could see it,

33:04.862 --> 33:17.140
then you realized it was probably the best

33:04.862 --> 33:17.140
for security, and even though the guy I knew him 
later in life as a full colonel, and he was clear of

33:17.947 --> 33:21.791
everything. It was just one of those things. A very 
interesting thing happened that

33:24.995 --> 33:32.964
later came back to, I'm sure, assist. I had a pay 
officer by the name of Loren Durkee. He was one of my

33:37.769 --> 33:39.311
second lieutenants. At that time,

33:40.332 --> 33:47.160
enlisted personnel were paid in cash at the pay 
table. Come up, salute the pay officer, and the

33:49.284 --> 33:58.686
sergeant would sit there and read off how much he 
got, and the pay officer would hand him so much

33:49.284 --> 33:58.686
money, and the guy would sign on the line and turn 
around and walk off.

34:02.094 --> 34:06.364
We got through paying the squadron, and we had $94 
left on the table.

34:08.791 --> 34:10.473
He came to me and said, what do we do? And I said, 
First Sergeant, I said, Sergeant Hartman, call

34:10.593 --> 34:14.317
the squadron back in. So we hadn't given anybody 
permission to leave the post. I said, call the

34:17.460 --> 34:21.644
squadron back in. And went down the amount that 
everybody was to be paid, had everybody checked to

34:21.664 --> 34:27.690
be sure that they'd gotten that much money. Went 
back over to the finance officer where we'd drawn

34:28.871 --> 34:31.974
the money. You're clear. You're all right. So they 
said, what are we going to do with it? I said, okay,

34:40.763 --> 34:50.495
you're sitting on an order to turn in all of our 
athletic equipment tomorrow back to the base. We

34:51.476 --> 34:52.517
can't take it with us. We already knew we were 
leaving. We can't take it with us. You and Sergeant

34:58.024 --> 35:06.113
Hartman go downtown to Mobile tomorrow and buy $94 
worth of athletic equipment. List it. Spread it in

35:07.178 --> 35:10.202
the squadron so we know where it is. And when we got 
to England, we were the only outfit that had any

35:11.885 --> 35:17.252
athletic equipment. We had $94 worth of athletic 
equipment. Paid off before we ever got there. The

35:23.861 --> 35:29.830
third day out, we had a boat drill out in the 
Atlantic. And I'd been down visiting my troops. We

35:33.575 --> 35:35.818
were in little cabins, but they were down below. 
While I was down there, they rang the siren before

35:36.929 --> 35:41.815
we hit our side spot on the deck. And I had no sooner 
got on the deck than somebody yelled, Lieutenant

35:43.337 --> 35:50.526
Johnson doesn't have a life preserver. In 15 
seconds, one hit me right behind the head.

35:56.694 --> 36:01.620
I don't have any idea where it came from, but it came 
from somewhere in that squadron. Huh? No, it was a

36:05.515 --> 36:07.238
life preserver. But boy, had I been caught on that 
deck without that life

36:07.258 --> 36:17.371
preserver, they would have ripped me from one end 
to the other. But somebody in that squadron took

36:17.391 --> 36:20.456
care of it. That's right. Before we ever left 
Mobile. When did you leave? How long were you

36:27.986 --> 36:28.807
there? We left in... July of 42. So I got back from 
the Adjutant General School in December just

36:34.933 --> 36:41.040
before Christmas. In seven months we had formed 
the outfit and had gone up to Dick's and we pulled

36:41.300 --> 36:52.934
out in July.

36:53.935 --> 37:01.223
While we were there, for instance, this is back to 
the old Harvey way of doing things,

37:03.076 --> 37:05.480
Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I 
very casually, at a standby inspection, one day

37:07.262 --> 37:17.598
said to one of the enlisted men, I said, I believe 
you've got your socks and your handkerchiefs

37:07.262 --> 37:17.598
crossed that belong in the opposite corner. I got 
to the door while I hear this, and I said, son of a

37:17.618 --> 37:26.110
bitch, who the hell is making this? Well, the next 
day, the boy was pretty well beat up, apparently.

37:30.869 --> 37:35.716
And I asked the first sergeant, I said, do you have 
any idea what happened to this man? He said, no, but

37:35.736 --> 37:43.467
the duty corporal and he were down on the beach last

37:35.736 --> 37:43.467
night. And this was, we were still close enough to 
regular Army troops that that was still prevalent

37:43.487 --> 37:58.868
in, well, I had a, first sergeant that went off to 
officer's training school. And I called the next

38:07.335 --> 38:16.666
sergeant up and said, okay, Sergeant Prattman, 
you've inherited this first sergeant's job. And

38:17.688 --> 38:20.271
he says, Lieutenant, says, not me. He says, this 
thing is going to be a civilian man's army, and it's

38:20.731 --> 38:27.319
rapidly becoming one. You don't want another one 
of us to be your first sergeant. He was a career

38:33.260 --> 38:34.502
officer? Huh? Was he a civilian or a career 
officer? No, he was a career non-commissioned

38:36.585 --> 38:40.011
officer. Right, okay. That's right. He said, you 
don't want me. He said, if you can find me one more

38:43.457 --> 38:48.144
strike somewhere, I'd appreciate it. He said, but 
the man you want to be first sergeant of this

38:48.164 --> 38:52.732
squadron is Sergeant Hartman. Hartman... had 
been a selectee, he had come in the draft route. So

39:00.924 --> 39:05.188
we gave them each one more strike, and then later on 
gave Ortman one more strike. And when we sailed,

39:05.208 --> 39:08.832
Ortman was the first sergeant. Fought like a 
selectee, worked like a guy that had been drafted.

39:13.377 --> 39:17.242
Perfect set

39:13.377 --> 39:17.242
up. Some of these old boys were sharp. Some of them 
knew that. Things were changing fast enough that

39:23.324 --> 39:28.849
they'd be completely out of place. Because, man, 
that old system, it could get rough.

39:42.562 --> 39:44.083
Mobile was an interesting place. It later became 
one of the largest depots and kept turning these,

39:52.737 --> 40:00.926
air depot groups out.

40:00.946 --> 40:20.128
Unfortunately, when we got to England,

40:00.946 --> 40:20.128
I keep saying all of our efforts were wasted 
because

40:00.946 --> 40:20.128
we got there mighty, mighty early and they didn't 
yet need air depot groups, but later As I got in

40:20.902 --> 40:27.030
other jobs, I realized that you can't move all the 
checkers at one time. You've got to keep putting

40:27.090 --> 40:31.135
them in there, you know, and sooner or later you've 
got everything you need. But we could have gone

40:31.235 --> 40:36.702
over a year or 18 months later and still been there 
on time. So what did you do when you arrived in July

40:37.463 --> 40:41.969
of 1942? In August, yeah. In August, whereabouts, 
where were you stationed? That's interesting. We

40:47.636 --> 40:49.018
debarked. at Swansea, Wales. And Swansea is a 
tidal port. You come in with the tide. And if you're

40:58.238 --> 41:01.162
little, you stay afloat. And if you're big, you sit 
on the bottom and wait till the tide comes in to take

41:01.202 --> 41:06.950
you back out. Well, we got in just in time. And we sat 
on the bottom and then leaned over against the

41:08.452 --> 41:12.238
dock. And so there the ship was leaning against the 
dock. Everybody got on the trains. And they went

41:17.085 --> 41:18.887
all over the United Kingdom. Well, our 
destination was Warrington. Warrington sits

41:24.925 --> 41:28.229
between Liverpool and Manchester. So it's in that 
part of the country. And the night that we got to

41:32.235 --> 41:40.125
Warrington, we weren't quite yet where we were 
supposed to be. Jerry made one of his last big raids

41:40.906 --> 41:47.175
just starting at Manchester and just dropping all 
the way to Liverpool. So that was a big industrial

41:47.195 --> 41:49.498
area. Not precision bombing, just hat-hazard 
bombing. Well, the train stopped. I turned to

41:57.628 --> 42:02.234
Sergeant Hartman and I said, Sergeant, get these 
men off this train. And he and the other sergeant, I

42:03.755 --> 42:09.622
bet they cleared that train in about 30 seconds. 
They went out the windows, they went out the doors,

42:09.642 --> 42:14.288
they went between cars, they went out the top 
ventilators. They got off that train every way

42:14.348 --> 42:16.991
imaginable. We didn't lose a single guy. Was the 
train hit? Yeah. But that was our baptism. Well, we

42:27.745 --> 42:36.336
got to a place called Burtonwood, and we sat there, 
and we sat there, and we used our $94 worth of sport

42:27.745 --> 42:36.336
equipment. Really wasn't anything to do for about 
a month, I guess. And then they started tapping the

42:42.083 --> 42:48.932
entire group to... manned different outfits all 
over the United Kingdom. Before it was over with,

42:53.379 --> 42:57.846
the 7th Air Department had practically lost its 
identity of personnel. It hadn't lost its name. I

43:00.971 --> 43:09.804
went from there up to Prestwick, Scotland, and 
became the Air Corps base adjutant up there

43:00.971 --> 43:09.804
sitting on an RAF base. It's both a municipal field 
and an RAF base. Had some pretty interesting

43:18.325 --> 43:20.568
incidents.

43:24.353 --> 43:35.287
We had, well, this pilot was subordinate to me, 
went up also with me, and his name was Jarvis. He's a

43:35.307 --> 43:39.493
Mormon from Salt Lake.

43:42.356 --> 43:46.662
And we had to put a detachment way up in the Herbides 
that went up. Air Corps was flying across the North

43:48.008 --> 43:49.971
Atlantic. If they couldn't make it all the way down 
into Scotland, they'd make an emergency landing

43:49.991 --> 43:55.160
in the Hermitage. So we put one officer and six 
enlisted men up there that could work on the

43:55.180 --> 44:08.763
aircraft and hopefully get it flying so the guy 
could continue on into Prestwick if they made the

43:55.180 --> 44:08.763
emergency landing. And he'd fly me up there and pay 
the troops, and we'd take care of it. We were

44:14.587 --> 44:44.087
about

44:14.587 --> 44:44.087
two miles from Johnny Walker's plant at 
Kilmarnock and since the RAF had an arrangement

44:14.587 --> 44:44.087
with the plant they included us and so they gave us 
at the plant to defend if Jerry were to make a

44:45.164 --> 44:52.172
parachute landing on the plant. Oh, yeah. Well, it 
was a lot of fun and socializing, too, because we'd

44:52.732 --> 45:00.501
go over and make dry runs, you know, which would end 
up being very wet runs. But everybody would go into

45:00.701 --> 45:10.312
position and make out like Jerry was coming over, 
and then they'd close down the station and then

45:00.701 --> 45:10.312
pull out the scotch bags, and everybody started 
drinking scotch. But it was interesting.

45:15.539 --> 45:17.942
How did you get along with the British and the RAF? 
Well,

45:18.102 --> 45:27.714
pretty good, especially the Scots people up there 
were fine people. We hadn't flooded the island to

45:27.734 --> 45:34.862
the extent that we were in their heritage. This was 
still, this was 42. So it was great. They're happy

45:40.919 --> 45:41.920
to see you. Yeah. At least somebody's going to be in 
this thing with us, you know. Whether they go down

45:46.547 --> 45:48.650
with us or not, we don't know. But, you know, a good 
feeling. That was back in the day when the northern

45:54.078 --> 45:57.984
bomb site was quite a secret thing. I mean, boy, 
they controlled it, you know, under guard all the

45:58.064 --> 46:00.768
time. That was the biggest thing that we had for the 
bombers. Well, Prestwick was the northern port

46:04.594 --> 46:10.302
that the aircraft would enter coming into the 
United Kingdom. And after making a run across the

46:11.058 --> 46:25.615
North Atlantic, which might take a guy two or three 
days, you know, stopping here and there and so on,

46:11.058 --> 46:25.615
they'd park out there on this great big old grass 
ramp and open the door and then just start throwing

46:11.058 --> 46:25.615
out the tomato cans and the trash. And then some of 
our crews would have to go out and clean up the ramp

46:25.655 --> 46:30.681
as they moved on down into the kingdom. And sure 
enough, somebody found a Norton bomb site. They

46:34.966 --> 46:38.871
found it on Sunday, the one day that my office 
wasn't open. He brought it over to the passenger

46:39.948 --> 46:48.267
traffic terminal and says, turn this in to 
Lieutenant Johnson tomorrow. Norton bomb site.

46:49.309 --> 46:51.875
Just put Lieutenant Johnson's name on it and stick 
it down under the counter. Believe it or not, three

46:52.837 --> 46:56.505
weeks later, intelligence came up from London.
