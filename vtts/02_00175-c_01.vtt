WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:08.083
Things he did was establish, for me, it was 
Wednesday morning meetings. Every other week, I

00:09.606 --> 00:12.871
had an audience with him. Now, either of us could 
call and cancel, and sometimes did, but not too

00:13.652 --> 00:18.459
often. And for an hour, I had his complete ear. We'd 
spend three or four minutes talking about what was

00:22.425 --> 00:27.032
on his mind, and then the rest of the time was mine. 
And the answer to the question is yes, very

00:27.613 --> 00:30.898
definitely yes. Back to your own style, a while ago 
I meant to ask and I think I interrupted myself. As

00:40.501 --> 00:58.084
department head, how much did you feel bound, I'd 
say it's in a faculty review, a promotion, a

00:40.501 --> 00:58.084
tenure, or an appointment, how much did you feel 
bound by the majority opinion of the department?

00:58.638 --> 01:00.401
compared to your own evaluation? For the most 
part, I felt the faculty's will ought to be served,

01:00.641 --> 01:09.796
but I wasn't afraid if there was... I only recall 
one time going against the faculty in a tenure

01:10.737 --> 01:20.713
decision, and of course I sent both 
recommendations forward, but Was yours negative

01:20.879 --> 01:23.161
compared to theirs? No, mine was positive and 
theirs was negative. Okay. In that particular

01:25.984 --> 01:29.288
instance, it could have gone the other way. What I 
made my faculty a promise with, one good example is

01:31.610 --> 01:38.157
new faculty hires. A promise I made them was that I 
would not hire someone that they didn't want, but I

01:39.098 --> 01:48.287
would not allow them to hire someone that I didn't 
want. And that worked pretty well in most things we

01:48.858 --> 01:51.842
dealt with. I don't, if I erred, I erred on the side 
of bringing the faculty in too much. I think they

01:58.770 --> 02:00.572
got weary of that toward the end. And I probably 
didn't use good judgment in some cases. During

02:05.218 --> 02:11.085
your years as department head, now in looking 
back, did the department miss any opportunities?

02:12.346 --> 02:16.131
We missed a big one right at the end of my tenure. I 
think, time will tell. We had an opportunity to

02:20.434 --> 02:23.638
develop a biomechanics lab. We had biomechanics 
as a specialty, but we didn't have a very good lab.

02:28.064 --> 02:30.607
We had an excellent exercise physiology lab. We 
had a very good motor learning lab. We had a chance

02:34.392 --> 02:38.297
to develop biomechanics, and I thought we should 
have done that. If we had done that, we'd be

02:39.018 --> 02:46.287
studying in a very scientific way the most 
efficient way of performing a sports skill, and

02:46.891 --> 02:54.142
might even could have landed one of the Olympic 
training centers on this campus. But the exercise

02:54.903 --> 02:58.689
physiology people at that time saw that as a 
threat. Because it was going to take some money to

02:59.249 --> 03:00.792
do that. That equipment is not cheap. And they saw 
that as money siphoning away from them. The motor

03:07.822 --> 03:09.625
learning felt the same way. And that was a case 
where the faculty carried the day. I didn't think

03:13.349 --> 03:18.334
that was a decision that needed to be unilaterally 
made. It was one that if enough people were against

03:18.355 --> 03:20.757
it, it would fail. I think we missed the boat there. 
I think we really should have done that. But time

03:27.464 --> 03:37.215
will tell, because what we have done instead is our 
exercise physiology program is twice as large now

03:27.464 --> 03:37.215
as it was. We have the only two distinguished 
professors in the College of Education are both in

03:37.550 --> 03:47.747
physical education, the current department head 
and Jack Wilmore, who was department head last

03:37.550 --> 03:47.747
year. That program I think very quickly will be, 
we're talking about top tens, I think very quickly

03:47.787 --> 04:01.870
they will be named among the top ten in the country 
and maybe in the top four or five. Now, in terms of

04:02.069 --> 04:05.436
Vision 2020, that's the right track to take. In 
terms of serving the people of Texas, I'm not so

04:07.380 --> 04:11.489
sure. Your health was what caused you to need to 
decide to step away from being department head, I

04:20.615 --> 04:22.539
presume. Well, no, actually not. I had decided 
that I was going to do that because I was reaching

04:24.002 --> 04:32.380
the point where I felt like Well, I lost my leader. 
Corrigan had stepped down as dean. And he had been

04:37.983 --> 04:41.589
my, let's see, one, two, three, my fourth dean. And 
as you know, you can only serve so many masters that

04:42.391 --> 04:46.357
way. Because every one of them changes a little, 
and that forces you to change your direction a

04:46.718 --> 04:51.326
little. And you tend to lose some of your 
consistency, I think. That had a lot to do with it.

04:59.459 --> 05:00.841
The other was I was growing tired. I'd been there a 
while, and I think they were a little tired of me

05:00.901 --> 05:05.487
too. And I enjoyed teaching, and I wanted to get 
back to that. I had already made the decision to

05:10.873 --> 05:19.984
retire, not retire, but to resign from the 
department of his job, and in fact had resigned

05:10.873 --> 05:19.984
before I was diagnosed with heart disease. And so 
what did you start doing, and what were your goals

05:20.004 --> 05:25.892
then as a full-time faculty member? I... I 
requested a study leave and was granted that. And

05:31.678 --> 05:34.092
so I went down to Baylor College of Medicine I have a 
good friend down that I had been working with all

05:34.358 --> 05:47.296
these years and took some courses there and also at 
the UT School of Public Health to try to recover my

05:34.358 --> 05:47.296
discipline a little because I obviously had lost 
my discipline by then. I came back and my goal was to

05:47.316 --> 06:02.037
spend the first year getting my classes laid out so 
that I felt comfortable then and then my second

05:47.316 --> 06:02.037
year I was going to focus on establishing a 
research agenda and I had full plans to to become a

06:02.472 --> 06:04.938
working active member of the faculty again.

06:07.825 --> 06:11.654
Because when I became a department head, I thought 
I was near the cutting edge of my field. I wanted to

06:11.895 --> 06:13.258
get back somewhere then. I made the first year all 
right, but it was in that first year that my wife was

06:13.897 --> 06:22.491
diagnosed with breast cancer and then I was 
diagnosed with heart disease. I'm afraid I didn't

06:24.695 --> 06:34.150
meet that latter goal because by then I was 
thinking pretty seriously about it was time to

06:24.695 --> 06:34.150
start thinking about retiring. But you're still 
full-time right now? I'm still full-time right

06:36.233 --> 06:37.294
now. And what are you working on? Well, this year, 
for the first year I haven't taught. I've been

06:42.700 --> 06:44.302
teaching a full load until this year. This year I 
bought my teaching time out with a chair. And what

06:48.167 --> 06:59.320
I'm attempting to do is get ready to turn loose the 
camp because that still is, I think, an important

06:48.167 --> 06:59.320
part of our department. I'm on the board of 
trustees for the Reed Youth Charities. And Mrs.

07:03.577 --> 07:11.365
Reed would like for me to continue to be the 
overseer of the camp even after retirement. And I

07:11.385 --> 07:12.567
may very well come back. In fact, the plan is to come 
back 25 percent of the time and do that. But this

07:16.951 --> 07:21.336
year what I've tried to do is locate some of our 
campers. We don't have real good follow-up work on

07:21.396 --> 07:25.220
where those youngsters are. Each one of them that 
go to that camp are guaranteed a scholarship to

07:25.240 --> 07:31.947
A&M. We haven't been moderately successful. 
They're all at-risk kids, and getting them in the

07:35.628 --> 07:39.174
university is real difficult. We've only had 
seven or eight or nine all the time we worked. But

07:42.640 --> 07:43.521
where are the rest of them? I'm convinced that 
we've done some good with those youngsters, but

07:43.702 --> 07:48.270
where are they now? So I've been trying to do some 
follow-up with them. And then also establish some

07:50.776 --> 08:00.408
relationship with school districts where they 
will help us identify youngsters who are at risk

07:50.776 --> 08:00.408
that we can give that same experience to. So I've 
been doing most of that this year. I had enough

08:03.352 --> 08:06.616
funds in the chair to do it once. I couldn't do that 
more than once. Of your almost 30 years here, To

08:13.557 --> 08:27.459
what administrators, deans, vice presidents, or 
provosts, presidents, chancellors, I'm not

08:13.557 --> 08:27.459
going to ask the negative, to which 
administrators would you give the highest marks

08:13.557 --> 08:27.459
for their leadership here at A&M? Well, I've 
always already said that Jack Williams was my

08:29.341 --> 08:34.830
hero, and I'll stick by that. I think he was 
outstanding. But he, in all honesty, he didn't

08:39.117 --> 08:41.961
have a lot of effect on me. other than 
peripherally,

08:42.177 --> 08:46.956
the president that, I knew Jarvis Miller very 
well. His daughter and my daughter played in the

08:49.862 --> 09:05.784
orchestra, the Rises Valley Orchestra, and I was 
with him on a trip to see our girls play the week

08:49.862 --> 09:05.784
before he was named president the next week, and I 
didn't have a clue that was going to happen. So I

09:07.766 --> 09:14.175
knew him well, but I have to say Frank Vandiver 
probably was the next president that I was most

09:15.252 --> 09:16.774
impacted by. He had a tumultuous administration, 
but gosh, he was good to work with.

09:30.755 --> 09:35.441
You recall the days when seniors didn't have to 
take final tests. The faculty senate decided to

09:36.102 --> 09:39.347
dig their heels in, and we were going to change 
this. And we went to his office. to hear the words

09:44.328 --> 09:48.182
spoken by him that it ain't gonna fly. And we were 
able to sit there and work out and negotiate a

09:49.446 --> 09:56.852
compromise. that when we hit upon it, it was almost 
like he knew this is what should happen, but he was

09:57.136 --> 10:07.446
waiting for us to say it and walked away from there 
feeling real good about it. And in fact, we got it

10:07.466 --> 10:09.127
done. He was a faculty member's department 
president, I think. I think he never was

10:12.991 --> 10:16.254
comfortable being a president. He was still a 
faculty member. So from that point of view, those

10:18.336 --> 10:21.539
were the two that I thought the most of. I really 
only worked... a reasonable time with two deans,

10:26.026 --> 10:33.737
Hubert when I was a faculty member and then later on 
as department head. Lembacher, Phil Lembacher

10:34.699 --> 10:44.132
was acting for a year and he was very, very helpful 
because I was a brand new department head, didn't

10:34.699 --> 10:44.132
know, come here from Sycam and he helped me an awful 
lot. But then Corrigan would have to be my pick

10:44.713 --> 10:50.041
there. I worked with Chris Borman as an acting dean 
for a while. And then I only served one year under

10:54.764 --> 10:57.708
Jane Stallings.

10:59.890 --> 11:07.299
So at the dean's level, I thought that was, Cargan 
would be my pick. I only worked for one department

11:08.301 --> 11:22.358
head here, and that was, well, no, actually, Carl 
Landis was the department head, but I worked with

11:08.301 --> 11:22.358
Bob Armstrong, who's the current department 
head, and Jack Wilmore, but it was after I had been

11:08.301 --> 11:22.358
in that role, and they pretty well left me alone, 
and I didn't, I didn't and I tried to stay out of

11:22.810 --> 11:24.432
their way. So I have to say in retrospect that Carl 
was really fun to work for and that's surprising me

11:26.315 --> 11:37.311
that I can say that today because my first three or 
four years I wouldn't have told you that at all. Are

11:38.112 --> 11:46.945
there other people related to your A&M experience 
if they could be brought into this room that you

11:38.112 --> 11:46.945
would want to express appreciation to? Oh, gosh, 
yes. Brian Cole was really helpful. Particularly

11:54.411 --> 11:56.594
after I became department head, he was helpful. 
Because he was then the assistant. He was then

11:59.017 --> 12:06.206
assistant to the dean and became, before I left the 
office, he became associate dean and took

11:59.017 --> 12:06.206
Limbacher's position. He was really good to work 
with. And Cargan was wise enough to turn a lot of

12:11.052 --> 12:15.818
things over to him. That's in the college level. 
I'll always appreciate Chris Borman, because he

12:18.452 --> 12:23.459
took a thankless job and did it. I don't think we 
were, as a university, was quite straight with

12:25.282 --> 12:36.519
him, because he took the acting dean's job 
thinking he had a chance to be dean, and really

12:25.282 --> 12:36.519
didn't have a chance. In the upper 
administration, Chuck McCandless was

12:37.561 --> 12:40.746
outstanding. Of course, he understood us. I loved 
that guy like a brother almost, and he was neat.

12:51.578 --> 12:54.701
I've forgotten who was provost that went to Iowa 
State. It may have been your friend that called you

12:54.761 --> 12:57.444
about the basketball club. Oh, no, no. Former dean 
of geosciences. Right, that's right. I really

13:04.911 --> 13:08.514
liked him an awful lot. You were gone by the time he 
came aboard, weren't you? He did a very nice job.

13:15.029 --> 13:22.257
Let's see, some goofy moments in your A&M 
experience? I took the liberty of trying to think

13:22.277 --> 13:24.519
of a few of those. One was, remember Howard Vestal? 
Sure. Howard Vestal erected a stop sign in the

13:28.103 --> 13:36.331
middle of a block right across from Rudder Tower. 
This was after you, I think you may have been in

13:38.674 --> 13:42.758
Missouri at that time, but he came out of his office 
one day and almost got hit by a car, came back the

13:43.244 --> 13:49.172
next day and ruled that they were going to put a stop 
sign up. And he had a stop sign right in the middle of

13:49.192 --> 13:52.376
that intersection where he crossed. And cars 
would . And 30 minutes after he retired, that stop

13:55.620 --> 14:00.867
sign came down. That's a good one. I thought that 
was outstanding.

14:08.641 --> 14:12.966
Pranks that anybody ever played on the department 
head while you were the department head? I don't

14:14.868 --> 14:19.494
know whether it was a prank or not, but God played a 
prank on us. My first year as department head, the

14:19.714 --> 14:23.759
snow melted on Mount Aggie.

14:26.682 --> 14:27.903
I think you were still here then. Well, I know what 
Mount Aggie was. Yeah, okay. We had AstroTurf on

14:32.114 --> 14:46.935
Mount Aggie, and Carl Landis retired, but one of 
the last things he did was buy something called SNO

14:32.114 --> 14:46.935
something. I forgot what it was. Snow Flow or 
something like that. It was a black surface. It had

14:51.341 --> 14:55.047
prongs sticking up on it, and the kids really liked 
it. The teachers liked it because it really would

14:55.107 --> 14:58.712
give you the feel of edging in snow. The only 
problem is when the weather got the slightest bit

14:59.283 --> 15:08.074
cool that fall, that brittle, and they'd pop off 
just like machines. And so I got a phone call. Chip,

15:13.020 --> 15:19.889
what's Chip's name, works down at the TV station, 
one of the radio stations in town, Chip Howard.

15:20.430 --> 15:22.492
Chip Howard wanted to interview me. And, of 
course, I'd only been on the job just a few weeks,

15:22.512 --> 15:25.476
and I thought, Oh, Lord, I am going to embarrass the 
whole university. And what he wanted to envy me

15:28.653 --> 15:34.002
about was the snow that melted on Mount Aggie. And I 
went to great detail to explain to him that we were

15:34.022 --> 15:40.572
careful not to waste the university's money. I 
surely thought he was on a witch hunt when he came.

15:45.058 --> 15:50.046
Probably the worst thing that happened to me It 
happened in 1986. We had a teacher, she's still on

15:51.805 --> 15:58.652
our faculty, a very fine teacher. And she taught 
outdoor, what we called outdoor education. And in

16:02.481 --> 16:08.072
that program was a weekend camping trip where they 
would go out to the wilderness someplace. And in

16:08.132 --> 16:14.524
this case, they went to Enchanted Rock out near 
Kerrville and would rock climb at the backside of

16:08.132 --> 16:14.524
that rock. And she did some really neat things with 
those youngsters. That was the safest thing they

16:19.113 --> 16:22.159
did was rock climbing, in fact. But she did some 
really neat things with those kids and we have a

16:22.139 --> 16:33.261
ropes course that she developed and a lot of 
business executives go through that building

16:22.139 --> 16:33.261
team and that kind of thing. But she had gone by 
automobile and she had six people in a car and on the

16:34.443 --> 16:41.076
way back, Out there where the east loop joins 21, 
she was ahead of this particular, I don't know if

16:41.663 --> 17:05.477
there's a car ahead of them or not, but she was ahead 
of one car and she exited on to the sixth loop and she

16:41.663 --> 17:05.477
said she looked in the rearview mirror and saw the 
other car missed the turn and remarked did they

16:41.663 --> 17:05.477
miss the turn. What they did was they went down 
another few blocks and realized they'd missed the

17:05.879 --> 17:21.440
turn, pulled over, and then made a U-turn right in 
front of a tractor truck, and it killed five of

17:05.879 --> 17:21.440
those kids, and one of them was Robert Walker's 
son, Richard. I'm telling you, I'm still fragile

17:23.542 --> 17:27.828
about that. It's the worst thing that can happen to 
anyone. To a lesser degree, I understood what

17:35.697 --> 17:39.521
President Bowen was going through with the 
bonfire thing. It just eats your guts right out.

17:43.405 --> 17:46.268
And I don't think I ever recovered from that 
totally. It's something I remember, but I don't

17:46.368 --> 17:50.432
want to remember it. Yes. And Bob Walker and his 
wife Joanne were rocks. I mean, just strong,

17:58.601 --> 18:01.985
strong faith. That's right. Absolutely.

18:06.545 --> 18:08.710
All right, now I'm just about out of questions. 
What have we left out that we should have? Well, I

18:10.895 --> 18:16.969
think maybe you gave me a chance to say about 
everything I noticed.

18:18.693 --> 18:21.460
You were talking about Mac Prescott a while ago. I 
was thinking about some things. Everybody who

18:25.090 --> 18:29.415
lives in the administration, I think, has some 
one-liners that are really good. You were always

18:29.435 --> 18:30.436
good at this. Your sense of humor was, I think, kept 
you apart. Mac Prescott was famous for saying,

18:35.101 --> 18:40.147
give me patience and give it to me now. And I'm 
humble and proud of it. And I guess I picked up some

18:44.191 --> 18:49.918
little things like that from nearly everybody who 
sat in that office. I remember

18:56.123 --> 18:59.307
Oh, who was the president that preceded Bowen? I'm 
blocking his name. Bill Mobley? Bill Mobley. Bill

19:04.814 --> 19:14.326
Mobley retired and John Coles retired three days 
before him and three days after him. And at John

19:15.287 --> 19:24.038
Coles' retirement reception, Bill Mobley said, I 
promised myself that I would retire three days

19:15.287 --> 19:24.038
before John Coles. I thought that was good. I 
believe we've, okay, let me then appoint you as a

19:28.127 --> 19:35.998
consultant. Let's make believe that you have now 
been recruited to advise the department and the

19:36.018 --> 19:50.598
college about what they're, what they should be 
trying to do next. What advice would you give to the

19:51.479 --> 19:54.143
department in the College of Education as they are 
looking toward the future?

20:03.433 --> 20:10.928
I think from the college's point of view, they're 
in a real difficult situation. Somewhere along

20:13.212 --> 20:14.595
the way, we decided that colleges of education 
were the cause of poor teaching that goes on in

20:16.448 --> 20:26.283
public schools and poor education that goes on 
there. And consequently, colleges of education

20:26.804 --> 20:31.210
are just hanging on by their fingertips.

20:33.714 --> 20:41.646
And as a result of that, they are doing some things 
that they might not ought to be doing.

20:42.537 --> 20:49.791
I wouldn't expect anybody to take this advice, but 
I think it's what colleges ought to do, is they

20:42.537 --> 20:49.791
shouldn't sell their souls in order to survive. If 
they can't survive doing what they are designed to

20:49.811 --> 20:56.083
do, then fold. Just go away. Now, that's contrary 
to what human nature is. But I think if we aren't

21:01.794 --> 21:03.617
careful, we'll try to do some things we shouldn't 
be doing, and we wind up not doing those well and

21:04.103 --> 21:10.089
getting in trouble. If I were going to advise the 
department, a lot of it goes back to what you and I

21:11.870 --> 21:17.836
have already talked about.

21:20.578 --> 21:28.866
I really think that we are much, much 
overemphasizing the exercise physiology

21:20.578 --> 21:28.866
component.

21:29.567 --> 21:30.988
They don't have a constituency. They're very good 
at what they're doing. They're conducting very

21:34.265 --> 21:36.990
good research. And as I said, we have the only two 
distinguished professors in the entire college.

21:42.700 --> 21:43.382
And they are good. I think their research would 
stand up with anybody's. But who are they doing it

21:46.848 --> 21:49.351
for? They can't, they don't have a constituency. 
They're doing it for the sake of reporting it in

21:53.134 --> 22:01.623
journals of which other exercise physiologists 
will read and do research and report to other

21:53.134 --> 22:01.623
exercise physiologists. And that pyramid's 
going to topple one of these days. We're, more and

22:05.888 --> 22:13.075
more we're charging students who are using the 
university We're putting more and more of the

22:13.342 --> 22:18.827
burden of paying for the university on them, less 
and less on the state. And the more we do that, the

22:18.847 --> 22:24.713
more critical the parents who are paying for the 
education are going to be. And one day they're

22:24.873 --> 22:27.356
going to look and say, what are we getting for our 
money? And I'm of the opinion right now that it's

22:28.817 --> 22:38.607
the worst investment they make, based on what, as 
an insider in the university, I think it's one of

22:28.817 --> 22:38.607
the worst investments they make. And that breaks 
my heart to say that. I wish I didn't believe that. I

22:43.086 --> 22:43.867
wish it weren't true. And hopefully it isn't true, 
but it sure feels that way. So I'd say to our

22:46.852 --> 22:56.367
department, we need to determine who our 
constituencies are and try to address their needs

22:46.852 --> 22:56.367
better than what we're doing right now. All right. 
Let's make believe someone walks up and gives you a

23:01.555 --> 23:06.383
check for a million dollars with one condition. 
You must pass it on to Texas A&M, but you've got to

23:07.088 --> 23:11.232
decide the use of that money. If you could make a 
truly meaningful gift to this institution, for

23:12.093 --> 23:16.977
what purpose would you give that?

23:22.362 --> 23:25.785
There's just a bunch of them, obviously.

23:28.548 --> 23:34.193
You're asking me now to be magnanimous, and I don't 
know if I could be.

23:47.386 --> 24:06.967
Well,

23:47.386 --> 24:06.967
I guess what I think, I don't know if this would be 
the answer I'd give or not, but it addresses a need

23:47.386 --> 24:06.967
that's consistent with what I just said. The cost 
of going to school is greater now than it's ever

24:07.007 --> 24:16.617
been, and I fear that a lot of people are being cut 
out now for reasons that they never were cut out

24:17.086 --> 24:20.469
before. When I came to school, money was not going 
to keep me from going to college. My ability and

24:24.253 --> 24:29.478
willingness to study might, but I could probably 
make it. I could sell eggs and make it. But that's

24:33.922 --> 24:35.043
not true anymore. So I guess I would encourage that 
person to put them into scholarships that

24:35.643 --> 24:41.629
students could. What kind of students would you 
want to receive these scholarships? Well, I don't

24:46.263 --> 24:54.412
think I would, again, this is consistent with what 
my beliefs is, I wouldn't want them to become the

24:46.263 --> 24:54.412
elite student. I wouldn't want them to go to the 
elite student. To the elite? Yeah. You mean elite

24:58.718 --> 24:59.659
in? Elite in terms of having to be the very top best 
students you can get your hands on. I think when all

25:07.328 --> 25:13.755
your scholarships are restricted to just that 
level of student, Again, we're leaving a lot of

25:13.853 --> 25:15.658
people out. Would this be on the basis of need? Yes, 
yes. What about their major? Well, I don't know if I

25:22.415 --> 25:25.804
would want to... Obviously, I'd be biased. I'd 
want... us to get the whole million dollars. But I

25:29.171 --> 25:31.052
don't think it should. I think the need is going to 
be across the board.

25:37.838 --> 25:46.426
You could make the case that maybe some fields are 
attracting people who can pay their way. But I

25:46.766 --> 25:50.009
think there are people who can go into those fields 
who can't pay their way.

25:52.952 --> 25:56.955
There's no question that we've got a dichotomy 
going on in our society. The rich are getting

25:57.256 --> 25:59.119
richer, and the poor are getting poorer. And I 
don't think it's all because of the rich being so

25:59.139 --> 26:08.696
selfish and jealous. I think some of it is the way 
we're running our universities. We've become so

26:12.182 --> 26:17.070
elite until all of us want to teach the very best, 
and we want to shoot the rest. And was it Jefferson

26:17.607 --> 26:31.263
who said, you could tell me, to expect a country to 
be uneducated and free is to expect what never was

26:17.607 --> 26:31.263
and never will be? We're leaving a lot of people 
out. And A&M is contributing to that, because

26:35.008 --> 26:45.100
every time we pass a $50 a semester fee, someone 
else is not coming to school because of it. Last

26:45.569 --> 26:46.310
question. What feelings do you carry in your heart 
for this institution now? Oh, I love it. I love it.

26:51.757 --> 26:55.701
I've always fallen in love with every institution 
I've ever worked in. I don't know whether my dad

26:56.522 --> 27:00.848
taught me this or where I got it, but I've never 
worked at a place I didn't love. It doesn't take me

27:02.790 --> 27:08.036
very long to fall in love, but A&M is a special 
place. I tell my kids when I talk regularly that

27:08.056 --> 27:12.882
there's two or three things I've learned about 
them. One is they are unique. To say that there's a

27:16.096 --> 27:20.343
spirit of Aggieland is to belie the spirit of other 
universities. Every university has a spirit. But

27:21.905 --> 27:23.387
this is a very distinct spirit. And what I say to 
them is, you don't know how good you are. I have

27:28.114 --> 27:29.697
found that they know how to play. And they can play 
as good as any of them. But they know when to stop

27:31.840 --> 27:34.104
playing and start working. And they do it better 
than any group I've ever been associated with. For

27:38.725 --> 27:44.780
a non-aggie, I bleed maroon and white pretty 
severely. It's

27:45.803 --> 27:51.317
a great place.
