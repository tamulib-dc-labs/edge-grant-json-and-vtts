00:02.478 --> 00:23.552
March 10, 1999, sitting in the living room with Jim 
Cashion, getting ready to hear his recollections

00:02.478 --> 00:23.552
of life at A&M, both when he was growing up, but also 
as a student.

00:23.572 --> 00:28.840
Your parents came to A&M when?

00:29.157 --> 00:33.060
I believe in August of 1926. Let's go back and tell 
me a little about them and their experience before

00:33.781 --> 00:38.625
coming here. Okay, well, my dad graduated from 
Erskine College in South Carolina and came to

00:39.546 --> 00:58.523
Austin College, I'm not sure if it was his first 
job, about 1912.

01:00.258 --> 01:07.168
I have his, an Austin College ring

01:00.258 --> 01:07.168
in 1912. And he was secretary of the YMCA and at one 
point athletic director at Austin College until

01:07.248 --> 01:22.790
World War I. And went into the service

01:30.430 --> 01:41.272
I guess under the auspices of the YMCA, I really 
don't know for sure, but I think it's sort of like

01:30.430 --> 01:41.272
the USO was in World War II. But he was in France with 
the YMCA during World War I, and after the war he He

01:51.203 --> 02:02.220
joined the British YMCA and was in Egypt and Africa 
for a little

01:51.203 --> 02:02.220
over a year. My mother was a native of Wills Point, 
Texas. And she had friends who lived in Sherman.

02:13.077 --> 02:17.143
And through that connection met my dad just before 
World War II, World War I, and they

02:17.866 --> 02:35.129
were married in 1925, I believe, 24 or 25, I'm not 
exactly sure, after he came back to Austin College

02:17.866 --> 02:35.129
after the war. After the war? After World War I. Was 
he again with the YMCA there at Austin College?

02:42.619 --> 02:45.122
That's when he was athletic director. Did he have 
any other duties other than that? I don't think so.

02:50.091 --> 02:56.037
I know he was the general secretary of the YMCA. As 
you understand it, in today's terminology, what

02:56.057 --> 03:07.287
services did the YMCA provide at that era on a 
campus? Well, you're talking about at A&M? No, at

03:10.069 --> 03:10.609
Austin College. I'm not sure about Austin 
College. I'm assuming that it was more or less like

03:14.330 --> 03:23.403
the YMCA program at A&M was after he came down here. 
All right. And they come down here in 20... He came

03:26.187 --> 03:27.529
down here in 1925. He came down as the general 
secretary of YMCA. Do you know who it was that hired

03:31.174 --> 03:32.836
him? Do you know any of the circumstances that... 
No. You don't remember what his pay was or anything

03:35.740 --> 03:38.204
like that? No. I remember one time... Well,

03:42.190 --> 03:52.982
this was just before World War II. And I guess I was 
probably in high school because I was interested

03:53.002 --> 03:59.650
in his buying a new car. And I went with him one day to 
pick up his paycheck at the fiscal office. It was in

04:08.240 --> 04:10.763
the new administration building. And he couldn't 
find a parking place, and so he just double parked

04:11.502 --> 04:17.370
and told me to run in and get his check. And I did, and 
I looked at it, and I think it was about maybe $300.

04:21.675 --> 04:26.602
And I thought, oh, my goodness, anybody that's 
making that much money ought to be able to buy a car.

04:26.862 --> 04:28.064
This was his monthly check. This was his monthly 
check. All right. So I imagine his salary is $3,500

04:31.729 --> 04:35.393
or so. I'm not sure. All right. He came, and the Y 
building... that we know today. And as far as you

04:41.239 --> 04:50.067
know, as far as you can describe what the building 
contained at the time he got here. Well, the YMCA

04:50.087 --> 04:57.914
building at that time was the nearest thing A&M had 
to a student center.

05:00.317 --> 05:09.505
They had a semi-basement, but on the main floor 
there was a big lobby. They had ping pong tables.

05:12.508 --> 05:15.813
They had easy chairs. They subscribed to nearly 
all the major newspapers in the state that the

05:15.873 --> 05:24.025
students could read. They had a desk in the lobby 
there that the students could buy postcards and

05:24.045 --> 05:34.481
stamps and stationery.

05:36.924 --> 05:38.867
And behind the lobby there was a chapel. and the 
chapel was used for all sorts of meetings, but the

05:39.910 --> 05:55.226
main group that met there, as I recall, was the 
first president of the church, or the eight

05:39.910 --> 05:55.226
emperors that met in the chapel of YMCA. On Sunday 
at normal worship hour, I am expressing a bit of

05:55.646 --> 06:08.820
surprise that any specific denomination could 
have used it Every Sunday? Every Sunday. And there

06:12.214 --> 06:22.948
was a

06:12.214 --> 06:22.948
union Sunday school made up of several 
denominations that met in the old assembly hall

06:12.214 --> 06:22.948
every Sunday morning. Who taught that? Was there 
any legendary teacher? My dad was taught for a

06:27.534 --> 06:30.137
while. Caroline Mitchell was one of the teachers.

06:36.345 --> 06:38.368
I can't really remember...

06:40.120 --> 06:48.493
And we met under the stage

06:40.120 --> 06:48.493
in the assembly hall. And then later, we met under 
the stage in Guyon Hall. There was a space. You're

06:56.545 --> 06:57.386
saying we. Did you go before you were an A&M 
student? Oh, yeah. By the time I was an A&M student,

07:02.313 --> 07:07.601
the Union Sunday School was defunct. Oh, OK. 
Probably in elementary school. They gave you a pen

07:15.071 --> 07:17.794
if you attended for a year. The second year, you got 
a wreath around the pen. And from then on, you got a

07:22.139 --> 07:24.582
bar for each year. I think I had six or eight bars. 
The record was held by a guy named Duke Thornton,

07:29.046 --> 07:39.017
who is currently a member of South Minister 
Presbyterian Church in Sugar Land. And I think he

07:39.250 --> 07:44.897
had 14 bars.

07:44.917 --> 07:55.950
Anyway, the YMCA cabinet was made up of students 
that were interested in the Y program. As best I can

07:57.412 --> 08:06.102
describe, it was the college version of the Hi-Y 
that was in the high schools. In the basement of the

08:06.689 --> 08:12.757
YMCA, there was, at one time, there was a swimming 
pool. And it was not a... It was there until they

08:15.741 --> 08:17.744
built the P.L. Downs Natatorium. And can you 
relate about what year that might have been to you?

08:24.353 --> 08:26.115
I'm guessing it was about 1936. Okay, so... But the 
pool was, it was just a big bathtub. It didn't have a

08:31.843 --> 08:34.607
circuitry system in it. And once a week, they 
had... drain it, scrub the walls, and then refill

08:36.659 --> 08:40.143
it. And that was the only time that I ever got to swim 
in it. It had been drained because it was over my

08:45.209 --> 08:50.055
head. And I got to play in it until the water got deep 
enough that I couldn't stand up and then I had to get

08:50.115 --> 08:57.003
out. So about once a week I got to go swim. About what 
dimensions? The pool was... Well, it was the size

09:04.334 --> 09:08.438
of three bowling alleys. Because when they built 
the P.L. Dow Junior Natatorium, they covered the

09:11.721 --> 09:20.549
pool over and put three bowling alleys in the area 
where the pool had been. In addition to the bowling

09:20.649 --> 09:33.801
alleys, they had pool tables downstairs, there 
was a barber shop, and Casey's Confectionary,

09:20.649 --> 09:33.801
which was a privately run soda fountain. Could you 
buy sandwiches and burgers? Sandwiches and

09:38.738 --> 09:40.821
burgers and ice cream. Let's see. What that would 
be normal things today would not have been so. No

09:47.250 --> 09:47.851
beer. Tobacco? Yeah, cigarettes. Tobacco and

09:53.339 --> 10:00.589
then just soda fountain types of sandwiches. I 
don't think they had hamburgers, but they had They

10:03.751 --> 10:10.419
had sandwiches and ice cream, fountain drinks. 
And I'm assuming telephones were there if

10:11.220 --> 10:20.231
somebody needed to make a phone call home in that 
building. I think there were two or three public

10:20.551 --> 10:27.139
telephones in the lobby of the Y. And to my 
knowledge, they were the only phones on the campus

10:27.159 --> 10:32.205
that the students could use to call home. And when 
your dad arrived, the building had already been

10:32.860 --> 10:38.888
built, and the Y was a going organization. Do you 
remember about the number of staff that he had as a

10:40.110 --> 10:45.438
part of the Y? Well,

10:46.239 --> 10:55.371
Jay Gordon Gay was the assistant secretary.

10:56.393 --> 11:01.500
And then the rest of them, he and Gordon were the 
only two people that worked on the live program.

11:03.688 --> 11:17.360
The other people that worked in the building, of 
course, they had the secretary and custodians,

11:03.688 --> 11:17.360
but the barbers were, I mean, they were, that was a 
private barber. I mean, it was a public barber

11:17.380 --> 11:18.982
shop. And the confectionery was owned by Mr. 
Sparks and Mr. Casey. And so, as far as the staff was

11:26.128 --> 11:30.812
concerned, it was just, my dad and Jake Warren 
Gates. Describe your dad physically and then

11:33.565 --> 11:47.019
describe his personality and what he believed in, 
good things and things that he wouldn't tolerate.

11:48.220 --> 11:54.947
Well, first of all, he was a Presbyterian elder. In 
fact, in those days, it was before the the sessions

12:01.876 --> 12:31.495
that rotated so he was an elder and he was as long as i 
remember he was an elder on the session of the

12:01.876 --> 12:31.495
president one of the things he was concerned about 
as a as a secretary of the ymca was the fact that uh

12:01.876 --> 12:31.495
well in those days the students would come to a m in 
september There were no cars, no automobiles. If

12:34.772 --> 12:42.042
they went anywhere, they hitchhiked or they went 
on the train or the bus, but primarily they

12:34.772 --> 12:42.042
hitchhiked. But for the most part, they stayed on 
the campus from the time they came in September

12:42.062 --> 12:51.556
until probably Thanksgiving. And then they went 
home again at Christmas and maybe if they didn't

12:57.108 --> 13:00.812
live too far, at Easter, and then at New Year. And so 
they were on the campus for a considerable amount

13:00.832 --> 13:26.558
of time, and well, I guess on the weekends they had 
time on their hands, and he was concerned about the

13:00.832 --> 13:26.558
kinds of things that went on in the dormitories, 
the gambling, and you know, and

13:00.832 --> 13:26.558
carousing, and of course there weren't any women 
around, but he was concerned about the kinds of

13:27.128 --> 13:30.553
things that they had to do on the weekends. And one 
of the things that the YMCA did was they sponsored a

13:30.673 --> 13:38.524
free show, a free movie. In fact, the only movies in 
College Station were run, the movie was in the

13:38.544 --> 13:48.978
assembly hall and it was run by the YMCA. They had 
movies on Tuesday night and Saturday night for the

13:48.998 --> 13:55.347
general public. the students and anybody else 
that wanted to go. On Wednesdays and Fridays, they

14:01.420 --> 14:10.028
had what they called,

14:01.420 --> 14:10.028
let me see if I can remember the name. Anyway, they 
were there to benefit. The clubs could sponsor a

14:13.031 --> 14:19.537
movie and whatever they could make from it. And on 
Sunday, the YMCA had a a movie, they showed a movie

14:23.575 --> 14:31.081
starting at one o'clock on Sunday and it was free 
and everybody wanted to go. Would those Sunday

14:31.101 --> 14:39.228
movies be more serious religion related or would 
they just be the cheapest thing? Some of them

14:39.328 --> 14:43.992
weren't even talkies, they were silent.

14:47.195 --> 14:53.380
But occasionally they would have one that 
everybody, but the place was full every Sunday.

14:54.018 --> 15:06.850
They didn't want anything else to do, so everybody 
went to the movie on Sunday, and then after the

14:54.018 --> 15:06.850
movie, they'd play touch football or softball or 
whatever else they could find to do. Now, your dad

15:07.470 --> 15:14.617
was not part of the rules enforcement staff. Not 
that I know of. Okay. So his was to be a positive

15:16.218 --> 15:20.982
factor. I guess, you know, He did an awful lot of 
counseling, I'm sure, and I don't know what his

15:25.152 --> 15:42.390
title might have been, or what level of, you know, 
he might have been considered as.

15:48.637 --> 15:54.163
He did a lot of counseling with students that were 
homesick and having problems, When he came, do you

15:54.582 --> 16:04.632
remember his talking about who the key leaders of 
A&M were in his early years? Of course, I guess Dr.

16:04.712 --> 16:07.655
Walton was the president. Okay. No, I don't 
remember. Do you remember his ever describing Dr.

16:11.660 --> 16:15.704
Walton? No, except we lived across the street from 
him, you know. Oh, so you, oh, all right, well then

16:20.309 --> 16:23.352
you describe him. Well, Dr. Walton lived in the big 
house.

16:29.697 --> 16:40.732
Well, first of all, there was the YMCA, and there 
was a street, and I can't name the name of it, that

16:29.697 --> 16:40.732
was right in front of the YMCA, on one corner there. 
It intersected with the main entrance from the

16:40.752 --> 16:44.638
railroad station. Military Walk. No, Military 
Walk was behind the line. Oh, oh, oh, that's right,

16:50.085 --> 16:53.229
that's right, that's right. And this was... It 
might have been Houston Street. But at the

16:57.472 --> 17:09.468
intersection of the main entrance, the 
boulevard, from the railroad station to the YMCA,

16:57.472 --> 17:09.468
there was the Bugle

16:57.472 --> 17:09.468
Stand. And that street ran, relatively speaking, 
ran north to the North Gate. And at the end of the

17:16.598 --> 17:22.065
first block, beyond the YMCA, there was a cross 
street and on that corner was the President's

17:23.075 --> 17:31.427
home. And it's across the street from what's now 
the All Faith Chapel. Beyond the President's home

17:37.235 --> 17:41.981
was the hospital. And Dr. Marsh lived, the college 
physician lived on the corner there and we lived

17:42.001 --> 17:49.592
next door to him. So we were just a short block from 
the president's office. Now, there were many,

18:00.140 --> 18:05.026
many faculty and staff that lived on campus.

18:07.630 --> 18:09.232
Most of them at one time. As far as you know, was that 
provided free of charge, or was there a stipend? I

18:16.502 --> 18:21.128
think there was a very small rent charge. However, 
I think that probably some faculty members were

18:21.648 --> 18:29.217
provided with it. I don't know which ones. It never 
occurred to me to even wonder if my folks ever paid

18:31.320 --> 18:35.565
rent. I know that in about 1939, when they asked us 
to move off the campus, my dad bought the house that

18:35.625 --> 18:50.423
we lived in for less than $500 and had it moved from 
the campus down to south of what's now Bush Drive

18:51.128 --> 19:07.333
and they set it down there and remodeled it and we 
lived in it until my dad died and we never sold it.

19:07.353 --> 19:07.573
1939. That was 1939. What street? We lived at the 
corner of Timber and Anna, Homer Covington, I mean

19:11.119 --> 19:17.929
Homer, Homer Adams lives there now. He bought the 
house from my mother. He still lives there. Back to

19:27.629 --> 19:28.449
your dad. Describe him physically and by 
personality the way a reporter or a historian

19:28.950 --> 19:38.098
might describe him. Well, he was about 5'10", 
probably weighed 190. He had a ruddy complexion

19:43.263 --> 19:48.388
and a high forehead.

19:52.762 --> 19:58.971
He had been an athlete at one time. He was a pitcher 
and he had an opportunity to play

19:58.991 --> 20:12.551
in the Texas league, but turned it down. In fact, he 
played semi-pro baseball and the last game he

20:12.651 --> 20:18.139
pitched was in Oklahoma City, which is not here. 
But who is, again, I don't have the slightest idea.

20:24.422 --> 20:26.145
He grew up in South Carolina? North Carolina. 
Where? At Davidson, North Carolina. Near

20:31.754 --> 20:34.398
Davidson, Huntersville is the name of it. It was 
committed right outside of Charlotte. And his

20:38.825 --> 20:45.595
younger brother, Jay, pitched for the Washington 
Synod. I

20:46.942 --> 21:02.824
ought to tell you who some of the players were, but 
this was about in the 1920s, I

20:46.942 --> 21:02.824
think. Easygoing? Easygoing.

21:09.092 --> 21:10.454
He enjoyed the students. At one time, he probably 
could call most of the students by their first

21:16.051 --> 21:20.080
name. All right. And so your mother and dad come 
down here. You said your mom grew up in Texas. They

21:26.475 --> 21:27.919
met at Austin College. Where did they live when 
they first got? Then that house you mentioned?

21:32.649 --> 21:32.950
Right. They moved it in directly to that house. 
They lived in Sherman for a little while before,

21:35.373 --> 21:52.268
and I don't know a thing about their deal up there, 
but they came down here and moved into the house

21:35.373 --> 21:52.268
that we lived in until they asked us to move off the 
campus. All right, as your memory begins,

21:52.288 --> 21:56.953
describe the campus physically. What buildings 
were where?

22:02.017 --> 22:03.979
Well, we've talked about the YMCA. The 
dormitories that I remember on campus early until

22:04.803 --> 22:26.706
they built what's now the core dorms was Walton 
Hall and there were two small apartment style

22:04.803 --> 22:26.706
dormitories that were for graduate students. One 
was across from what's now the campus theater

22:26.846 --> 22:32.852
across University Drive on the campus side and the 
other one was right at the end of Walton Hall that

22:33.237 --> 22:43.131
they had to tear down when they built those dorms 
over there. Of course there were several houses

22:43.151 --> 22:48.499
that faculty members lived in. Mitchell Hall, 
Ross Hall, along Military Walk there were, let's

22:49.160 --> 23:01.017
see there must have been one, two, three, four, 
five dorms that I remember, Hart Hall,

23:03.697 --> 23:05.839
I can't think of names on that. Between Hart, as you 
go toward the Savisa Hall, there was a dorm right

23:05.859 --> 23:27.380
next to Hart Hall, and then Ross Hall that was later 
the Common Lands Office, and

23:05.859 --> 23:27.380
two more dorms. And then there was the Exchange 
Store, B and C unit facility, the building and

23:32.705 --> 23:43.339
college utilities that had warehouses and 
offices and so on.

23:46.784 --> 23:52.571
So there was very little south of Guyon Hall. There 
were a few residences south of Guyon Hall. But no

23:58.199 --> 24:00.602
dormitories, no classroom buildings. south of 
guyon and or south of the drill field right of

24:01.105 --> 24:28.648
course caulfield and the field house were over 
there and there was nothing but uh fault but the a.m

24:01.105 --> 24:28.648
farms west of what's now wilburville that was 
highway six uh the academic building was there i

24:01.105 --> 24:28.648
think the library

24:29.607 --> 24:39.216
And then I believe in 1936 they built the new Texas 
6, which is now Texas Avenue. And when they built

24:40.818 --> 24:45.483
it, they had to turn the university around. And so 
they built the new administration building. It

24:50.207 --> 24:53.931
was the eastmost building. I guess it still is. And 
you start first grade what year? I started first

25:01.837 --> 25:08.246
grade, well, let's see, it must have been about 
1933. Right, and the school that you attended,

25:08.266 --> 25:13.593
what did you all call it? A.M. Consolidated. And it 
was located where? It was located... where Dorm 2

25:22.595 --> 25:28.141
is right now. I don't know what the name of that dorm 
is, but it's in the core area. They tore that old

25:32.405 --> 25:50.423
school building down when they built the core 
dorms, and the northwestmost

25:32.405 --> 25:50.423
dorm is what we call Dorm 2, and that was almost 
exactly where the elementary school was. There

25:50.683 --> 25:51.724
was an old building, Pfeiffer Hall, that was at the 
south entrance to the academic building that the

25:52.801 --> 26:07.261
college loaned or rented or gave to the school 
district for the high school. That was where the

26:07.281 --> 26:11.467
grades eight through 11 went to school. About how 
many were in the first grade? That'll tell us about

26:15.112 --> 26:17.515
how big the enrollment. Well, I think the grades 
averaged about 25 to 30. I know my graduating class

26:23.058 --> 26:28.703
after the 11th grade, there were 24 of us. Oh, 
really? Now, what year was that? That was in 1944.

26:33.667 --> 26:47.458
And everything, all of A&M Consolidated School 
instruction was on campus until you were a fourth

26:33.667 --> 26:47.458
grader or something like that, fourth or fifth, 36 
or seven? We moved off the campus. I was in the

26:48.539 --> 26:49.660
seventh grade. Seventh grade. And they built the 
schools down there off of, Yeah, what used to be

26:53.197 --> 26:56.000
Jersey. Used to be Jersey Street, right. And in 
general, who were the students in this

26:58.142 --> 27:03.727
A&M-Saudade school district? Well, for the most 
part, they were the children of faculty members.

27:10.193 --> 27:20.543
But they later, I guess there was a school at Peach 
Creek, and there was a school at Wilburn at one

27:10.193 --> 27:20.543
time, and at Milliken. And at some point, And I'm 
not sure exactly when it was. They combined all

27:26.154 --> 27:30.638
those schools, and that's where it consolidated 
as a thing. Right. But when you were in elementary

27:31.799 --> 27:41.327
school, those youngsters from out in the country 
were still going to those country schools. Well,

27:41.348 --> 27:46.832
at some point, I don't remember when they combined 
us. But for the most part, I think the ones that I

27:46.852 --> 27:52.397
started first grade with graduated. the ones that 
didn't quit or something like that. Because there

27:58.879 --> 28:01.141
wasn't much moving around. People, if they were in 
the first grade, their parents generally stayed

28:01.561 --> 28:08.369
here until they... So you're born in Brazos 
County. Were you born at Old St. Joseph Hospital?

28:13.534 --> 28:16.097
No, I was born in my house on the campus. Right 
across from the hospital. Who was the doctor that

28:17.899 --> 28:19.360
came? Dr. J.E. Marsh Sr. Jack Marsh Sr. So the 
campus physician came... He was the college

28:25.687 --> 28:29.332
doctor, I mean the town doctor. There were two or 
three other doctors, Dr. Andre, I remember, and

28:29.613 --> 28:49.502
I'm sure there's some others I can't name, but Dr. 
Marsh was the only one I knew, and we lived across

28:29.613 --> 28:49.502
the street from the hospital, and there were There 
were two nurses, Mom Clegg Horn and Miss Vaughn,

28:50.478 --> 28:57.688
Earline Vaughn, lived in the hospital. And they 
were the permanent staff of the hospital. From

29:02.295 --> 29:09.426
time to time, there'd be other nurses if there was a 
flu epidemic or something. But Red and I, if we'd

29:10.287 --> 29:18.679
get a splinter or for whatever reason, If we needed 
his medical attention, we'd go to the hospital,

29:19.250 --> 29:24.676
and Mom would take care of us. One time, we were 
playing basketball while we were in the Y Chapel.

29:30.963 --> 29:39.613
They had folded chairs, and the chairs were all 
folded up, and Red and I were in the chapel playing

29:30.963 --> 29:39.613
basketball, and I threw the ball to him. He was 
standing next to the wall, and it went through his

29:40.594 --> 29:47.181
hands and hit him in the head, and knocked his head 
back against the brick, and cut a gash in his head.

29:50.344 --> 29:53.948
And of course he was bleeding like everything and 
it scared us. So we just went straight to the

29:53.968 --> 30:03.057
hospital and put a couple stitches in his head and 
sent us home. In fact, Red and I got going to the

30:04.098 --> 30:16.189
hospital in the morning, going to the kitchen and 
the cook was named Collie. And he would give us

30:17.080 --> 30:18.942
something. He always gave us a glass of grape 
juice. And it got so bad that we weren't eating when

30:22.425 --> 30:26.169
we got home. And my mother couldn't figure out what 
was the matter with us until she found out that we

30:26.189 --> 30:34.877
were eating bitter at the hospital before we'd 
come home. But not the Marsh. Our house was between

30:41.383 --> 30:46.108
the hospital and the Marsh's house. He'd walk 
through our yard, you know, it was just a hundred

30:46.409 --> 30:53.300
yards, and he'd walk through our yard. He always 
kept bird dogs and horses. Who were your playmates

30:57.648 --> 31:00.232
other than your brother? Jack Marsh and his sister 
Louise. Louise was my age. Jack was about three

31:06.342 --> 31:09.407
years older. To give you some idea how things were, 
One day Jack, I guess we were probably, I was

31:13.223 --> 31:20.953
probably fifth or sixth grade, something like 
that. Jack says, my dad's going to take out a guy's

31:20.973 --> 31:24.697
appendix, you want to watch? So I said, yeah. So we 
went over to the hospital and sat in the window of

31:27.461 --> 31:35.130
the operating room while Dr. Marsh took a guy's 
appendix out.
