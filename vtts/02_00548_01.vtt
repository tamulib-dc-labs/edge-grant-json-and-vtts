00:07.338 --> 00:15.646
When

00:07.338 --> 00:15.646
were you first employed by NASA? I think it was 
about 1962 when I started working here. How old

00:19.789 --> 00:20.390
were you? I was 21. And what was your position? I was 
working as a research scientist for the National

00:24.574 --> 00:37.125
Aeronautics and Space Administration and went to 
work in Cleveland, Ohio working on trying to

00:37.392 --> 00:51.811
determine how it was going to go to the moon and what 
procedures would go up there and what type of

00:37.392 --> 00:51.811
launch vehicles it was going to use and the size of 
the vehicles and the procedures at which we would

00:37.392 --> 00:51.811
go about putting man on the moon. What is your 
current position at NASA? I'm currently heading

00:56.317 --> 01:04.227
up the Projects Office, Operations Office for the 
Space Station Project Office. And this involves

01:05.219 --> 01:21.157
overseeing the overall space station design and 
making sure that all the operational

01:05.219 --> 01:21.157
considerations and how you're going to work with 
the station is considered into the design. And

01:23.099 --> 01:32.290
working any design problems we have in terms of 
operations and generally the integration of that

01:23.099 --> 01:32.290
whole activity. What various programs have you 
been involved in at NASA since you've been

01:33.957 --> 01:39.263
employed here? I started out really in the later 
days in the Mercury program and went through the,

01:39.283 --> 02:02.968
totally through the Gemini program, the Apollo 
program, the Skylab program, the ASTP program,

01:39.283 --> 02:02.968
the Apollo Soyuz program, and of course for the 
last 10 years or 10 or 12 years we've been working on

01:39.283 --> 02:02.968
the space or the SDS space transportation system 
and the orbiters operations and now I'm currently

02:03.607 --> 02:15.061
involved in the space station design 
development. I've actually worked on all the

02:16.302 --> 02:29.057
manned, two manned flights in terms of anytime you 
had to rendezvous or anything like that with

02:16.302 --> 02:29.057
vehicles then I was over to all those flights.

02:32.277 --> 02:38.324
How were our programs at NASA influenced by the 
desire to beat the Russians in establishing U.S.

02:32.277 --> 02:38.324
preeminence in space?

02:41.528 --> 02:58.487
That definitely had a big push back in the early 
days of getting man into space because there was

02:41.528 --> 02:58.487
concern about what the Russians was going to do in 
space and etc. It was a big challenge back in the

02:59.412 --> 03:03.936
early days to try to beat the Russians. We had a 
really big battle trying to determine if we was

03:05.377 --> 03:11.222
going to beat them to the moon or not. And it was 
never really clear when they decided not to go to

03:12.363 --> 03:16.727
the moon. But he was definitely ahead of us in terms 
of unmanned activities, and we did catch up with

03:17.448 --> 03:28.137
him. and have passed them over the last few years.

03:36.493 --> 03:53.148
That's probably, excuse me, primarily the reason 
Russians got a big jump on us was that when they

03:36.493 --> 03:53.148
built the boosters and things for their ray bombs 
and hydrogen bombs, they didn't try to clean them

03:36.493 --> 03:53.148
up. They had to have large launch vehicles to make 
them intercontinental, and therefore that size

03:56.888 --> 04:25.782
of booster did have also the capability of 
achieving orbit, where in turns we had took off,

03:56.888 --> 04:25.782
took into the policy of making clean bombs, making 
the bombs small, taking smaller launch vehicles,

03:56.888 --> 04:25.782
and when the Russians decided to put a satellite 
into orbit, they had the launch vehicle to do it,

03:56.888 --> 04:25.782
and when we saw them do that, put them ahead of us 
considerably. We tried to do it, we didn't have a

04:31.274 --> 04:36.139
launch vehicle to do it, so we had to go out and build 
a launch vehicle from scratch. So therefore, we

04:38.361 --> 04:40.483
was in a catch-up mode for several years. Does 
Russia have a shuttle now, or where are they right

04:41.224 --> 04:45.268
now? Or do we know? There is some pretty good 
feeling, I guess, where they're at. They've done a

04:52.576 --> 04:53.457
pretty good feel and man presence in space, 
they've got their own space station. They've been

04:58.320 --> 05:14.438
operating it for several years now, I don't know 
exactly how many, and they have manned it many

04:58.320 --> 05:14.438
times with various lengths of cruise stay time 
going up to several months at one time. So, as far as

05:14.478 --> 05:23.207
man's presence in space and running the basic 
experiments and that sort of stuff, they have

05:23.558 --> 05:24.979
That's what they've been concentrating on. There 
are some feelings that they're building that also

05:26.321 --> 05:31.326
will be on the space shuttle. It'll be a few years 
probably before that gets completed, but they're

05:31.346 --> 05:36.291
evidently working on that. And what else they're 
doing, I'm not really too much upon that. When you

05:42.998 --> 05:52.367
worked in Moscow guiding the Apollo-Soyuz flight 
in 1975, what differences did you notice between

05:42.998 --> 05:52.367
our space agency and theirs?

05:54.676 --> 05:59.263
Are there, is their agency primary militaristic? 
What did you notice? Well, the control center is

06:02.347 --> 06:13.664
located on a military base behind armed guards, 
concrete walls several feet high. That would

06:16.028 --> 06:22.337
imply it was a little more materialistic than what 
our program has been. I'd say yes,

06:23.498 --> 06:30.888
it probably is in those terms.

06:35.054 --> 06:36.255
What was the other part of that question? I'm 
sorry. What differences did you notice between

06:37.417 --> 06:41.302
our space agency and theirs? Well, that can get 
into a couple of days worth of discussion in case we

06:42.864 --> 06:53.218
try to make it short.

06:55.156 --> 07:08.477
They had a lot more control over their people, I 
think, than we have over ours in terms of, they

06:55.156 --> 07:08.477
didn't

06:55.156 --> 07:08.477
let the left hand know what the right hand was doing 
as much as we do.

07:12.243 --> 07:21.417
In terms of the actual operations, they have,

07:12.243 --> 07:21.417
they actually have three control centers that 
where we have one control center feeding

07:22.493 --> 07:28.402
information up to any particular activity on 
orbit. They may have changed that over the recent

07:28.422 --> 07:32.568
years, but when we was there, that's what they had. 
As far as getting down to detail, I guess what we're

07:34.691 --> 07:40.600
really talking about here is how you actually 
operate. They had, the control center is

07:42.142 --> 07:49.172
remarkably laid out like ours was. It was almost a 
identical copy. And since there's control

07:53.495 --> 08:03.186
centers built after ours, ones we worked out of, I 
have my own assumption there is that they copied

07:53.495 --> 08:03.186
ours. Even all the way down to console positions 
actually, front row, second row, third row,

08:04.028 --> 08:10.415
fourth row, console positions. As far as 
operating in the control center itself, one of the

08:11.837 --> 08:20.968
things that we've always done in our console 
positions is that You could always overhear what

08:21.708 --> 08:25.192
the flight director was saying. Most people would 
overhear on their comm lines what flight

08:25.712 --> 08:32.038
directors were talking to other people about. The 
Russian control procedure there was to say that

08:32.078 --> 08:42.129
you had individual comm lines, so you couldn't 
sort of eavesdrop on what was happening. That was a

08:43.070 --> 08:46.473
little bit more, keeping you more boxed in on what 
you were doing. The state of the art of the control

08:47.834 --> 08:50.517
center was was way, way beyond ours, or way behind 
ours in that they only had one computer generated

08:51.830 --> 09:09.055
display in the control center itself that we could 
see where we have at that time all of our displays

08:51.830 --> 09:09.055
were computer generated. Their main way of 
displaying data was taking computer pronounced

09:10.497 --> 09:19.390
software computers and actually put him on a TV 
camera and project him with TV cameras. As an

09:27.870 --> 09:49.321
agent, I was talking more or less in terms of 
operations, and I guess we can get into more detail

09:27.870 --> 09:49.321
on that if we wanted to, but jumping there back to 
what was the difference in their operations and

09:27.870 --> 09:49.321
how they worked versus how we worked, there's a 
couple, I think, unique characteristics there.

09:49.441 --> 09:50.102
One was they took and they would have single 
objective flights. Otherwise the B-1 do one. I

09:59.639 --> 10:16.056
forget how many launches they made in getting 
prepared for the Apollo service mission, but they

09:59.639 --> 10:16.056
probably made a half a dozen launches just to check 
out systems and check out procedures and that sort

09:59.639 --> 10:16.056
of thing. In fact, we didn't have any launches to 
get in preparation for the Paul Sawyer's flight.

10:26.415 --> 10:35.044
But they have single objective missions, and if 
they achieve that objective successfully, they

10:26.415 --> 10:35.044
come back. And if they don't, they launch again and 
try it again. And where we try to pack our flights,

10:44.470 --> 10:56.926
and considered on-orbit time is very valuable and 
we spend many, many hours trying to overlay the

10:44.470 --> 10:56.926
timelines so if something doesn't work, we pull up 
something else to try to fill in that timeline. So

10:56.946 --> 11:09.102
maybe do you think because their government 
completely supports their program and we don't

10:56.946 --> 11:09.102
have quite as much, maybe we don't have as much 
money to spend meticulously doing that kind of

10:56.946 --> 11:09.102
thing? I think it has a lot to do with it, yes I do. 
they have, they're less accountable to the people

11:13.225 --> 11:26.226
on how they spend their military, military, 
excuse me, how they do their space operations and

11:13.225 --> 11:26.226
their budgets. And they're not constrained as 
much as we are because we're accountable to the

11:26.246 --> 11:39.908
general public and everybody's down to one side 
and listens in on everything that's happening and

11:26.246 --> 11:39.908
we're constantly covered by the news media and 
totally open to the public. So, which makes us have

11:46.358 --> 11:57.434
to pack everything we can into a particular 
flight, which is involved and does cost a lot of

11:46.358 --> 11:57.434
money to do that. But that's one of the main things I 
could see a difference in terms of all flight

11:57.454 --> 12:07.548
planning and that sort of stuff is how they worked. 
But the control was basically the same as ours.

12:12.727 --> 12:20.155
with the exception of the way they actually did the 
internal control at the center, and the comm lines

12:12.727 --> 12:20.155
and such stuff. They seemed to be a little more,

12:20.176 --> 12:35.914
I don't want to say secretive, that's not 
necessarily the right words, but they tried to

12:20.176 --> 12:35.914
keep everybody with blinders on and looking down 
into certain paths and not be able to oversee. One

12:36.174 --> 12:41.620
thing I guess I got the impression of is that If you 
had an expertise in one particular field, and I had

12:43.186 --> 13:08.738
an expertise in another different field, and I was 
talking to a third individual who we would

12:43.186 --> 13:08.738
interface with, and if him and I would make a 
decision that would affect you, well I would I

13:09.089 --> 13:16.859
would come back and call you up and say, hey look, 
Allison, Joe and I made this decision. I think it's

13:16.919 --> 13:19.322
going to affect your area and etc. You ought to be 
prepared for this or try to go talk to them and work

13:19.383 --> 13:25.150
it out. And we would do that. That's a common way we 
work. I feel that the Russian system is not

13:30.717 --> 13:36.886
incentive to do that, so I wouldn't come back and 
call you up. I'd let you find out yourself.

13:41.557 --> 13:50.685
Okay,

13:41.557 --> 13:50.685
how were you treated by the Russian people overall 
as far as your stay? Not necessarily the

13:50.945 --> 13:57.771
people at the station, but just the people when you 
were there? I couldn't have been treated better by

13:59.813 --> 14:10.602
any group of people, either engineers working 
with them or also the general public. I spent a lot

14:11.442 --> 14:17.869
of my spare time amongst the local people. One was 
accepted with totally open arms. It was really

14:22.434 --> 14:23.595
neat. I spent many hours talking to people who knew 
less English than I knew Russian, and I knew about

14:23.835 --> 14:33.345
six words of Russian.

14:36.689 --> 14:39.812
You made a lot of use of a pencil and a piece of paper. 
You learn to talk with your hands a lot, and of

14:40.400 --> 15:07.977
course, unfortunately, you can only get to a 
certain level of understanding of each other,

14:40.400 --> 15:07.977
because we are communicating, I guess, what would 
a space agency call on a level A or top level of

14:40.400 --> 15:07.977
amount of communications, where you and I are 
conversing on a CD type level, otherwise a detail

14:40.400 --> 15:07.977
level of communications. They were

15:09.728 --> 15:31.409
absolutely astounding people, and that at any 
time you had time to talk to them and discuss

15:09.728 --> 15:31.409
something with them, they was there, they would 
make time for you, if it's three o'clock, four

15:09.728 --> 15:31.409
o'clock, five o'clock, six o'clock in the 
morning. They'd have a pot of tea on, they called it

15:33.512 --> 15:37.035
chai, and very eager to learn about us and our ways 
and what we did and that sort of stuff. So it was sort

15:46.326 --> 15:52.812
of a very interesting experience to go in and talk 
to those people. It's so much different than I

15:53.332 --> 15:55.414
think the United States are. I think they treated 
us a lot better than we treated them as

15:56.095 --> 16:00.579
individuals. They weren't suspicious of you or 
anything like that? No, ma'am. Not to be sure, not

16:06.023 --> 16:08.146
really suspicious. It was really, of course now I 
have to go back on the other hands too, though some

16:08.246 --> 16:15.135
people really didn't know what I was doing. The 
Europeans, especially Eastern European

16:16.637 --> 16:33.178
countries and all of Russia was totally, at least 
the Russians, were totally behind this

16:16.637 --> 16:33.178
involvement we had in the space, where in the 
United States we treated it as as hey, that's

16:35.335 --> 16:41.060
something NASA's doing and not much involvement 
and maybe heard about it once a month. Well, I don't

16:41.841 --> 16:51.970
think it's a day went by that I didn't hear 
something about the Apollo Soyuz program on TV or

16:41.841 --> 16:51.970
on radio while I was stationed there. They come out 
with all kinds of souvenirs, they even had a brand

16:53.551 --> 17:04.701
of cigarettes called Apollo Soyuz that was issued 
on the day of launch. and special stamps and

17:04.900 --> 17:14.670
special plaques and they really had the people 
really pumped up for it. They put a lot into it. So

17:17.032 --> 17:24.040
therefore, that

17:17.032 --> 17:24.040
essentially is what the country was putting 
behind it. This is a big thing for them and they

17:24.340 --> 17:29.665
really pushed the people for it too. But anyhow, we 
had a

17:35.343 --> 17:42.995
The excitement and the involvement I don't think 
was totally in my communications with some of the

17:35.343 --> 17:42.995
Russian people. Their openness and friendliness 
towards me had really, I don't think, that much to

17:45.218 --> 17:50.887
do with what I was doing. How did your impressions 
and attitudes toward the Russians change from the

17:53.150 --> 18:03.105
time, you know, what were your attitudes before 
you went, and then what did you come back, you know,

17:53.150 --> 18:03.105
feeling for the Russians? I tell anybody that's 
traveling to Russia the first time, second time,

18:03.727 --> 18:33.210
third time, let me tell you my fourth trip to really 
start understanding the Russian system, and the

18:03.727 --> 18:33.210
first time you go there, your basic travel people 
or travel bureau's interest, interest will show

18:03.727 --> 18:33.210
you some neat things and show you a lot of history, 
and naturally it'll give you the best propaganda.

18:34.051 --> 18:35.853
and keep you busy enough that you don't. Now I 
wasn't, don't get me wrong, I wasn't with

18:35.954 --> 18:42.803
interest, but you sort of got effectively the same 
treatment. That you get so involved in what's

18:44.585 --> 18:51.775
going on that you don't really have time to look 
around and see what's really happening around

18:44.585 --> 18:51.775
you. And it's only after about the third or fourth 
trip or encounter that you really start getting

18:53.497 --> 19:01.948
the total feel of the impression of the people. the 
constraints on the society, and what you're

19:02.975 --> 19:09.223
really constrained with. For example, you can't 
go outside of Moscow without a permit. Two years

19:13.969 --> 19:24.822
before I was there, you couldn't go outside your 
block area, your two or three block area that

19:13.969 --> 19:24.822
you're living in, after 10 o'clock at night, and if 
you did, you lost your job. What happens? You lose

19:27.626 --> 19:31.851
your job, you don't eat. all the jobs are 
controlled by the government, so you have to be

19:32.506 --> 19:36.852
approved by the government to get the job. If you 
don't have a job permit, you can't get it. If you

19:38.554 --> 19:40.657
don't get it, you can't eat. So it's quite a drastic 
effect on you. Your movement is very constrained

19:44.182 --> 19:49.350
and etc., so you have no cars. You don't? No cars. 
They do have the world's greatest transport

19:54.717 --> 19:58.342
system for people, though. They have a fantastic 
system for public transport. And the combination

20:04.253 --> 20:14.048
of the subways and their trains and their buses and 
everything like that is, I don't, I haven't seen

20:04.253 --> 20:14.048
anything equal in the world. You were talking 
about the permits you had to get to leave Moscow.

20:18.535 --> 20:20.478
What did that require doing? Well, we didn't, 
actually I was constrained to the Moscow region,

20:21.900 --> 20:29.091
so anything, we did take some bus trips outside of 
Moscow. But I'm talking about the people who live

20:29.645 --> 20:31.388
there. Like, for example, if you was a Russian, you 
would have had to go down to the local office and got

20:31.828 --> 20:39.700
a permit to come here to see me today for Brian. You 
couldn't do that. You had to state your business.

20:44.727 --> 20:46.249
You had to state your locality. So for you to travel 
outside of your area, region, like, say, Brian,

20:47.371 --> 20:58.487
Texas, you would have to go down and apply for a 
permit to leave. and have to carry your papers with

20:59.564 --> 21:01.247
you. It's sort of like, it's sort of equivalent to 
our probation system, where you, after you once

21:01.267 --> 21:09.279
get on probation, you can't leave the county 
without a county permission. And if you get picked

21:09.339 --> 21:14.206
up someplace else, you wasn't supposed to be 
there, then you can be put in jail. So I guess they

21:14.987 --> 21:17.871
have very little knowledge of what's going on 
outside. Well, I think they get more knowledge

21:20.275 --> 21:25.322
than maybe we'll give them credit for, because of 
grapevine. I'm just talking about the

21:25.342 --> 21:29.048
constraints on your freedom of travel. and the 
controls are put on you. And they spend more time

21:32.007 --> 21:38.655
there probably checking on each other than they do 
doing meaningful work. So you never know who's

21:40.177 --> 21:42.420
gonna be checking on who. So they have a lot of 
people looking over your shoulder and you don't

21:43.481 --> 21:49.209
know who's gonna turn you in. You don't know who the 
KGB necessarily is. So there's a lot of concern

21:52.613 --> 21:56.638
there as far as reporting and activities you're 
doing. What's your overall impression of them?

22:01.791 --> 22:13.904
Like myself, I think of Russians as not 
necessarily looking like us, or I think of them as

22:01.791 --> 22:13.904
mean and out to get us and things like that. What is 
your overall impression after being there of

22:13.944 --> 22:18.628
them? I like them. I like them in the sense that 
they're very humane. We've got propaganda. We

22:27.297 --> 22:31.082
were proprianderized every day, every time we 
turned the radio on. We were bombarded.

22:33.345 --> 22:40.134
Unfortunately, we were bombarded so much we're 
into the point of being complacent as far as I'm

22:33.345 --> 22:40.134
concerned. We don't understand the true fear of 
problems like somebody invading our country. The

22:48.786 --> 22:51.510
Russians suffered a lot over the many, many years. 
If you know your Russian history, I don't know that

22:51.590 --> 22:57.017
much, but we never have been invaded. They were 
invaded many times. The people themselves,

23:00.689 --> 23:08.056
they're neat. They're as neat as any other person 
you met. And one interesting thing about Russia is

23:09.958 --> 23:17.645
you didn't have to go to Florida to find somebody 
who spoke fluent English. Walking down the street

23:19.988 --> 23:25.553
in a building or wherever, you'd always find 
people who spoke good English. There's probably

23:26.613 --> 23:32.759
those who didn't say they spoke good English who 
did also speak good English.

23:34.481 --> 23:46.753
So there is somewhat concern there of,

23:34.481 --> 23:46.753
they think we're the oppressors, we're the 
aggressors. I'll give you, guess the best example

23:49.136 --> 23:51.838
I can give you. I was on an interview or on a tour to 
the, what I guess you'd call the Greek Orthodox

23:57.393 --> 24:02.280
Church. Church is equivalent to the Vatican of 
Russia. I think there's like 13 nations that makes

24:06.667 --> 24:10.012
up Russia totally. I've sort of forgotten how 
many. I think it's around 13. Many nations make up

24:14.098 --> 24:16.001
Russia. It's got a big language integration 
problem, the overall nation itself. Even though

24:20.247 --> 24:25.375
it is huge, it's more than one language, et cetera. 
Greek Orthodox Church is the main church there. We

24:30.285 --> 24:36.691
took a tour of their facilities, equivalent to the 
Vatican, and had an excellent reception. And

24:38.332 --> 24:50.223
after many glasses of champagne, vodka, cognac, 
et cetera, and a fantastic meal, and went through

24:38.332 --> 24:50.223
it and showed us through the facilities. And

24:51.964 --> 24:55.227
the the head person, the orthodox minister, the 
head man, I went up and talked to him as I was

24:57.468 --> 25:08.003
leaving, departing his company. And he held my 
hand and he says, I wish you'd go back and tell your

25:09.725 --> 25:21.562
people that not to be so aggressive.

25:23.325 --> 25:24.927
And now these people, see, if you believe in the 
Bible and believe in the church and all that sort of

25:25.480 --> 25:28.183
stuff. And here he's dedicated his whole life to 
doing that. And they're not supposed to be

25:34.789 --> 25:37.011
controlled by the government. Okay, they are to a 
certain extent, but they sort of, they don't, they

25:38.012 --> 25:45.840
back off of them for it, I can tell a little bit 
anyhow. Just to say something like that gives you

25:45.860 --> 25:53.648
the overall general opinion is that

25:45.860 --> 25:53.648
we're looked at as We look to them like bad guys 
sometimes, too, I think. Of course, that's true,

25:57.656 --> 26:04.522
obviously, because they do a lot of propaganda and 
say, hey, UAS is bad, and all that sort of stuff.

26:04.542 --> 26:06.004
Yeah, boy, they really do bad. In fact, an 
interesting comment Jared made to you is that, to

26:06.044 --> 26:22.420
fill that thought in, was that they take and daily 
go through the Western paper headlines and pick

26:06.044 --> 26:22.420
out the headlines liners of all the papers, and 
construct a paper, like a western, I got some

26:22.940 --> 26:46.301
copies, you know, like a western paper, and it has, 
you know, headlines like, three people murdered

26:22.940 --> 26:46.301
last night in New York, five people raped in Los 
Angeles, and 15 banks robbed, and so on and so

26:22.940 --> 26:46.301
forth. No good news. Just go through and pick out 
that, and that's what they say, that's a daily

26:48.042 --> 26:51.445
paper. and it's really disgusting to read all 
that. After you get over and read this, you say,

26:53.886 --> 26:57.571
God, the whole Western world has gone nuts. So 
anyhow, there's, I think one thing you have to

26:59.654 --> 27:19.643
remember is I think the Communist Party is only 
equivalent to about 5% of the makeup of the Russian

26:59.654 --> 27:19.643
people, so they keep a pretty big thumb on the 
people, so that the majority of the people are not

26:59.654 --> 27:19.643
the Communists. which surprised me. It's a small 
percentage, I don't know if 5% is right or not. Go

27:28.512 --> 27:28.832
ahead. Well you're currently working on the 
proposed space station you were talking about and

27:28.932 --> 27:40.307
what will that station be used for and its cost to us 
and its benefits to society? Can you describe that

27:40.387 --> 27:44.913
a

27:40.387 --> 27:44.913
little bit? That's a big piece to talk about Tara. 
It's obviously the next step into our manned

27:49.677 --> 27:54.884
presence of space. It's, I think, a very logical 
step. And that will establish a platform facility

27:59.270 --> 28:03.376
that will be manned. Hopefully, we're looking at 
having it permanently manned. Although, we're

28:08.784 --> 28:18.537
looking at an interim space of time where we might 
do a man-tended option, as we call it now. where you

28:19.310 --> 28:21.512
just go up and man it from time to time. We might not 
even take that option, but we're going to go into, I

28:21.732 --> 28:32.163
say, a total manned environment, working 
probably from six to eight crewmen to start with.

28:33.304 --> 28:35.005
Is it similar to like what Russia has? No, it's 
going to be a lot more sophisticated than what they

28:36.247 --> 28:42.513
have currently in orbit. It will be permanently 
manned. We'll be making round trips up there.

28:49.634 --> 28:58.185
Right now, that has to be determined, but we'll be 
going up probably to the station every 30 days to

28:49.634 --> 28:58.185
every 90 days, somewhere in that frequency. We'll 
be manufacturing all kinds of goods at the

28:59.647 --> 29:06.136
station. We cannot manufacture here on Earth, 
especially on an economical basis, because for

29:06.216 --> 29:18.392
those manufacturing processes, it requires no 
gravity, a high degree of vacuum, weightless,

29:19.267 --> 29:21.950
well, the weightlessness of gravity goes 
together.

29:24.794 --> 29:33.845
Minimum amount of contaminations and will allow 
making better transistors, for example. There's

29:35.006 --> 29:43.536
medicines that they can make on orbit that is 
uneconomically feasible to make them on Earth.

29:45.038 --> 29:49.003
And it'll basically be a moving towards 
commercial land, ground observations,

29:51.059 --> 30:16.129
mineral research into various mineral locations 
around the earth as far as observations from these

29:51.059 --> 30:16.129
facilities and studying other planets and that 
sort of stuff from the observatory position.

30:17.471 --> 30:18.332
We'll be probably be just as shattering on our 
society as the other, as the current program has

30:20.557 --> 30:27.586
had up to date. What about the cost? It's going to 
be, I mean the development cost to put the vehicle

30:32.553 --> 30:44.889
up, I mean the station up, it's going to be 
expensive, but it depends on how you measure

30:32.553 --> 30:44.889
expense. Right now we're trying to design to a 
station that we can deliver to the Cape to the

30:47.860 --> 30:58.792
launch facility for $8 billion. That doesn't 
include launches, to put it in orbit.

31:05.559 --> 31:15.910
Along with that, the Europeans, or the 
international involvement, are talking up to

31:05.559 --> 31:15.910
contributing as much as the equivalent of $4 
billion. So that would make it something like an

31:17.240 --> 31:20.964
integrated program of $12 billion. And that's the 
going in price side. We may have to take some

31:26.889 --> 31:30.433
shortcuts to meet those costs. How large are we 
talking about a station? How large would it be?

31:37.399 --> 31:37.880
Good question. I don't have the exact dimensions 
down.

31:43.325 --> 31:44.226
We're talking about like four habitat modules, or 
four modules sort of interconnected together

31:44.611 --> 31:57.866
that would be working positions and sleeping 
quarters and that sort of stuff for initially like

31:44.611 --> 31:57.866
six crew people. I think the total configuration 
of the station weighs somewhere between 300 and

31:59.288 --> 32:05.255
400,000 pounds. So, the orbiter weighs 240,000 
pounds. So, In gross wage, you're looking at

32:12.488 --> 32:19.298
something that a neighborhood weighs as much as 
two water chairs or less. Which will have large

32:20.700 --> 32:24.266
solar panels and that sort of stuff on this 
facility. Another big pro- one of the major things

32:25.708 --> 32:37.847
and one of the projects that functions in my office 
is to make people realize is that we're going to be

32:25.708 --> 32:37.847
operating this thing for the next 20 to 30 years up 
there. So everything we put on it, we have to be able

32:37.867 --> 32:41.432
to repair it in space. We had to have places to store 
spare parts. We had a big logistics problem of

32:44.105 --> 32:54.642
getting supplies up and returning supplies down, 
and that sort of thing. So it's going to be pretty

32:54.662 --> 33:06.981
much a manned facility, just like a place up in 
Greenland or something like that, and you're

32:54.662 --> 33:06.981
having to go provide supplies and things to it. 
When is, what are they thinking about, or is it in

33:07.636 --> 33:14.726
the planning stages, or are we near ready to take a, 
you know, start on that? We're currently in a

33:15.027 --> 33:19.673
position, we've gone through the phase A studies. 
Let me try to explain to you how we go through basic

33:20.635 --> 33:24.961
programs with NASA.

33:27.625 --> 33:35.196
We'll go through a phase A conceptual idea, like, 
almost to the point like, hey, there will be a space

33:27.625 --> 33:35.196
station. Then you go through the second phase of 
design, phase B. Yes, there will be a space

33:40.586 --> 33:45.712
station, and this is what it looks like, and this is 
what it contains. And that's basically all on

33:47.074 --> 33:48.976
paper. And then there's what we call the phase C and 
D, or C slash D. And phase C is where you actually

33:50.437 --> 33:59.908
build it. You cut the hardware, start 
manufacturing. And D is where you go into

34:02.918 --> 34:07.162
operation and those sort of go together, those two 
stations. We're currently in phase B, starting

34:07.902 --> 34:12.266
phase B April 1st this year. And we're currently, 
the total program is going to select eight major

34:13.707 --> 34:32.183
contractors divided between four centers around 
the United States to come up with the basic design

34:13.707 --> 34:32.183
within, currently shooting for 21 months. to be 
done with that. Well, you were talking earlier

34:34.466 --> 34:39.013
about other countries and contributions. You are 
part of a six-member panel that's meeting in

34:39.033 --> 34:46.303
Washington to discuss what those contributions 
will be. What countries are we talking about? What

34:49.567 --> 34:50.509
contributions? And is Russia among those 
countries? Okay, number one, Russia is not among

34:53.573 --> 34:56.838
those countries. We're talking basically for the 
European nations, Western nations. The,

35:05.385 --> 35:12.455
currently three groups of people have expressed a 
desire to join us into this activity. One is ESA

35:13.516 --> 35:18.563
from Europe, which is the European Space Agency. I 
believe it's made up of like 10 countries, totally

35:19.484 --> 35:31.060
sort of conglomeration of people who have joined 
us, and we've just got two going through one

35:19.484 --> 35:31.060
session, a successful venture with them.

35:32.204 --> 35:33.425
and that's the space lab. They built the space lab 
for us, and they build and we fly it. Now, the Jap-

35:39.511 --> 35:51.982
and they're talking about a significant piece of 
the operation getting involved in terms of

35:39.511 --> 35:51.982
money's concerned. Japanese are interested and 
they're wanting to get involved, and the

35:53.003 --> 36:02.211
Canadians are interested, and we've done one also 
interesting operation with Canadians. with the

36:03.068 --> 36:07.634
arm, with a remote manipulator system. So, 
currently we have those three. What we're trying

36:14.823 --> 36:31.725
to do in this committee is try to give the 
negotiators some idea of what would be logical to

36:14.823 --> 36:31.725
let the Europeans or these international 
involvement do and what is not logical to do. So

36:33.089 --> 36:47.848
what we're trying to do is to break that down and one 
of the big problems is that we need to figure out,

36:33.089 --> 36:47.848
they can't just contribute dollars, they gotta 
contribute goods. So it's like a bartering

36:48.689 --> 36:50.151
system. So when we define an activity that they 
could do, we also need to try to cost that activity,

36:51.072 --> 37:02.286
try to come up with some idea of what the equivalent 
dollar cost is for that particular function. I

37:05.772 --> 37:08.976
guess it's similar to like your, say your car. If 
you let some facility change the oil in it, it'd be

37:10.599 --> 37:17.169
like a European country. And you know what 
basically that dollar cost is. You know the cost of

37:21.455 --> 37:25.962
oil, you know the cost of, you know what it costs to 
do the change out. And say, well, we'd give them the

37:27.043 --> 37:30.248
job of change no oil in your car for the next twenty 
years. That's pretty straightforward.

37:43.226 --> 37:56.623
Why isn't Russia being, they're not expressed 
interest or is it just that we don't really want

37:43.226 --> 37:56.623
their help in this or don't want to consider 
Eastern European countries?

37:58.561 --> 37:59.282
They haven't. I don't know the total details of 
that. Obviously we wouldn't be asking them to, I

38:01.826 --> 38:07.594
think, join us into this venture. We might share 
some joint activities later, but I think it's too

38:08.475 --> 38:16.947
much involved and too much technology involved 
here. We want to watch the technology transfer we

38:18.128 --> 38:26.560
have between nations and very definitely we will 
be doing some state-of-the-art stuff. when we're

38:27.518 --> 38:28.960
building this facility. So their involvement 
might be in terms of actually coming and visiting

38:29.000 --> 38:38.391
this station at some time with other vehicles or 
something like that. Or we might run some joint

38:39.492 --> 38:41.535
experiments together. And generally those 
things have worked out as we sort of go the line

38:42.436 --> 38:49.705
between the western and eastern countries. 
Recently the government bought the Columbia into

38:50.986 --> 38:54.991
its first top secret military flight. Press 
reports said that that the cargo was a spy

38:57.202 --> 39:01.348
satellite used for listening in on the Russians. 
Do you feel that the government's goal, our

39:02.449 --> 39:08.197
government's goal in space has been shifted from 
exploratory to military aims? No, I don't think

39:09.078 --> 39:09.939
so. The military has always been somewhat, has 
been interested in the orbiter, in the orbiter

39:09.959 --> 39:25.099
program, and they're a customer for us to fly, and

39:26.041 --> 39:33.251
We charge them so much per flight to make those 
flights and they're just like any other customer.

39:37.236 --> 39:42.383
What administrations would you describe as being 
more military oriented? Speaking of those from

39:42.404 --> 39:50.374
say John F. Kennedy to Reagan.

39:50.395 --> 39:55.862
Well Reagan's obviously I think the more, he's 
more interested in the military than Probably the

39:55.994 --> 39:59.437
rest of the presidents and probably the rest of 
them combined.

40:03.520 --> 40:10.166
There's an interesting balance there, I guess, 
between what you do and how you operate. But

40:11.007 --> 40:19.394
definitely Reagan has been very high on the 
military and what it does. I think the rest of the

40:20.495 --> 40:23.438
presidents, I'd rate them about equal. I can't 
see.

40:27.972 --> 40:35.803
I can't see, I can't think of anything that would 
really pull one out above the other one right now.

40:35.823 --> 40:48.501
Are the programs, you being a part of NASA, the ones 
you're working on, are they primary research

40:35.823 --> 40:48.501
oriented or are they having some kind of military 
applications being thought about?

40:51.565 --> 40:57.253
Most of the programs we work on is more in the 
research and working with customer

40:58.111 --> 40:59.533
requirements. For example, the evolution of the 
overall space program has gone from putting man in

40:59.553 --> 41:17.252
space, to putting man on the moon, to

40:59.553 --> 41:17.252
doing, that was basically just doing tasks. And at 
that time we really wasn't worried too much about

41:18.433 --> 41:24.520
customer requirements. And then when we started 
in the skylight program, we started to get a little

41:24.540 --> 41:27.763
more interested in what can we do for the customer. 
There's more than one just, hey, go do the task.

41:34.188 --> 41:35.430
It's like climbing a mountain. After you climb the 
mountain, what do you do when you get there? So in

41:39.436 --> 41:46.907
the Skylab program, we started looking for 
customers and doing some customer interface,

41:39.436 --> 41:46.907
more so than we'd done in the past. And you're 
seeing a steady trend of that now as we move on into

41:47.888 --> 41:58.223
the

41:47.888 --> 41:58.223
Space Transportation System program, which is 
the orbiter. We moved in, that's going to be pretty

41:59.435 --> 42:11.528
well totally commercialized and be,

41:59.435 --> 42:11.528
tend to go more in the commercial world. And I guess 
what I'm trying to say to answer that question is

42:12.670 --> 42:24.042
that we're really going more commercial all the 
time and trying to satisfy as usual requirements

42:12.670 --> 42:24.042
because we're paying bucks to fly. In the past, 
NASA's been dependent on congressional

42:24.629 --> 42:28.774
appropriations for money. Is there a chance that 
maybe, you know, this trend toward

42:28.814 --> 42:37.325
commercialism, is there a chance that maybe in the 
future NASA won't be dependent upon that money?

42:38.487 --> 42:45.095
NASA will always be dependent upon money, but 
you've got to consider what NASA has used for you.

42:45.155 --> 42:48.199
NASA's used to do advanced research and 
development. As you get stuff operational, then

42:49.361 --> 42:54.467
it'll be converted over to commercial use. For 
example, we're going through a major contract

42:55.240 --> 43:12.645
right now, a change, coming up this fall, where 
we're going to contract most of the activities

42:55.240 --> 43:12.645
associated, operations activities associated 
with the space, with the Orbiture, to

42:55.240 --> 43:12.645
contractors. We're going to turn this whole 
facility, those buildings over there, they get

43:12.705 --> 43:24.943
turned over to, they don't occupy those 
buildings, but the tasks that those buildings are

43:12.705 --> 43:24.943
doing gets turned over to contractors who as hate 
by other government agencies who wants to fly on

43:25.379 --> 43:39.413
the orbiter, and the commercial people who want to 
fly on the orbiter, they pay hard dollars, and that

43:25.379 --> 43:39.413
becomes similar to how we subsidize the airlines. 
First, you know, FACA, which was the old, old NASA,

43:40.514 --> 43:54.508
developed the aircraft, everything worked out, 
and they then started converting the aircraft,

43:40.514 --> 43:54.508
turning the aircraft over to commercial 
commercial people and that's how the airline

43:54.792 --> 43:58.856
industry got started. Or this is the start of the 
space industry.

44:07.283 --> 44:13.389
What effect has the military's recent 
involvement in space have on future

44:07.283 --> 44:13.389
non-militaristic flights? Are you considering 
the military just a customer or are they actually

44:14.930 --> 44:22.437
having an input on scheduling and what you're 
carrying and anything like that? They are

44:27.829 --> 44:30.672
basically customers. They compete for flight 
schedules, flights for the vehicles. And if they

44:36.799 --> 44:40.964
buy the total vehicle, they get dedicated 
flights. And if they buy partial loads, they get

44:40.984 --> 44:45.390
integrated flights. And I look at them as being 
just competition. are users of the system, and we

44:52.167 --> 45:00.698
provide them the capability to do those 
particular activities. When we went to the moon, a

45:02.260 --> 45:11.752
plaque was left behind that said, Here men from the 
planet Earth first set foot on the moon July 1969

45:02.260 --> 45:11.752
A.D. We came in peace for all mankind. Do you think 
that we, being Americans, are still in space for

45:12.313 --> 45:16.759
peaceful reasons? I would think so. I don't hear 
any reasons for it or not. Of course, I'm not into

45:24.130 --> 45:30.218
all the military stuff, and even if I was, I 
probably couldn't say much about it. Do you feel

45:30.238 --> 45:33.522
that space will be the next location for a military 
arms buildup? It has definitely the potential of

45:35.365 --> 45:38.328
being that. As a militaristic person, it has 
definite advantages.

45:47.841 --> 45:49.022
So you do think it will be? I didn't say I didn't 
think it would be, but if I had something to do in

45:49.559 --> 45:57.126
those terms, I would look in that direction for 
sure. It makes things a lot simpler. I guess what's

45:59.628 --> 46:19.347
made me ask that question is Reagan's influence 
on, you know, that he keeps denying, you know,

45:59.628 --> 46:19.347
about Star Wars, you know, accusations that he's 
working towards having Star Wars, you know, but

45:59.628 --> 46:19.347
he's at the same time wanting to put satellites up 
that, you know, are listening in on the Russians

45:59.628 --> 46:19.347
and stuff. and defense weapons up there. Well, it 
depends on the national policy and how you go, but

46:23.375 --> 46:37.671
space definitely offers some inherent 
advantages to, in a militaristic sense. I mean,

46:37.691 --> 46:43.798
this talks about having hydrogen bomb powered 
lasers where you point to lasers at a city or a

46:44.842 --> 46:56.818
target and set the bomb off, and if that's an energy 
source for the lasers, a laser just erases the

46:44.842 --> 46:56.818
facility which you got pointed at. That's pretty 
interesting.

47:04.388 --> 47:11.517
On to a different topic, when you first went to work 
for NASA, were blacks and women employed in

47:04.388 --> 47:11.517
professional jobs such as your own? Yes, they 
were. How have hiring procedures changed with

47:15.166 --> 47:24.602
regard to blacks and women in response to the civil 
rights and equal rights movements,

47:15.166 --> 47:24.602
respectively? I can't, technically I really 
can't tell that it changed that much until I think

47:24.622 --> 47:33.116
it was always pretty open as far as I could tell. The 
problem we've always had is having qualified

47:34.478 --> 47:41.410
people to fulfill those positions. look on the 
qualified or quality of the people you're getting

47:42.098 --> 47:56.838
is what's been the main driver, and I think in 
recent years, women have got more involved in the

47:42.098 --> 47:56.838
subjects of engineering, etc. I'm sure, 
potentially, it's never bothered me in my 20 years

47:58.560 --> 48:06.711
of working here at NASA, it's never bothered me. In 
fact, I never did look at, number one, I couldn't,

48:07.812 --> 48:12.038
but I personally never did. And the people I've 
worked with as far as I know have never used those as

48:12.845 --> 48:17.070
discriminators. We always look at the 
qualifications. Has there been any resentment by

48:21.675 --> 48:29.564
white male employees, or has everybody, like you 
say, just kind of always accepted it? We have a sort

48:30.365 --> 48:40.557
of unique society here, I think, and we're all 
pretty much on a, on a, uh, solastic involvement

48:30.365 --> 48:40.557
where you try to, uh, Those problems that you 
associate in other industries, I think we see a lot

48:42.393 --> 48:47.121
less of here.
