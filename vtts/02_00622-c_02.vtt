00:01.010 --> 00:27.793
Now,

00:01.010 --> 00:27.793
beside Francis Shepherd, what other 
oceanographers would you cite as having some

00:01.010 --> 00:27.793
major impact on your career?

00:31.385 --> 00:53.040
Well, I think in the 50s, there were...

00:31.385 --> 00:53.040
Well, when I first began oceanography, the 
dominant person in the field was Harold Spurge, a

00:31.385 --> 00:53.040
physical oceanographer, so he didn't really 
affect me too much directly, but he was sort of the

00:31.385 --> 00:53.040
dean of oceanography. And in the 50s, there 
developed a triumvirate oceanographers in the

00:57.997 --> 01:08.467
US, and these were Roger Vell and Columbus Islin 
and Morris Ewing, the directors of three major

00:57.997 --> 01:08.467
laboratories. And

01:10.128 --> 01:23.801
personally, Roger Vell had much influence upon my 
career because we were very personally involved

01:10.128 --> 01:23.801
in many things, though we never did publish 
together. We were involved in expeditions.

01:28.827 --> 01:39.828
Columbus Houston had almost no direct influence 
upon me, but Morris Ewing had a great influence by

01:28.827 --> 01:39.828
his work at the Lamont Observatory. And he, to my 
way of thinking, was the preeminent sort of marine

01:40.349 --> 01:50.008
geologist of my generation. It's too bad he's not 
around for you to interview, but he had enormous

01:51.085 --> 01:58.575
impact upon marine geology and geophysics.

02:02.760 --> 02:15.237
So, as a person who was not a colleague of mine, not a 
direct colleague, he certainly had great

02:02.760 --> 02:15.237
influence upon my thinking and work.

02:16.837 --> 02:26.626
other people who had considerable influence upon 
my work, in geology, for example, Harry Hess, I

02:16.837 --> 02:26.626
knew very well, and he was, his ideas were very 
close to mine. We more or less thought along the

02:26.646 --> 02:29.729
same lines. And at Lamont, Bruce Hazen was always,

02:29.789 --> 02:41.700
his interests were very close to mine. His 
influence was very important. Now at Scripps, I

02:44.225 --> 02:48.690
guess Bill Menard and I worked together. H.W. 
Menard. He and I, of course, published together. I

02:52.714 --> 02:58.040
first bought him into oceanography and employed 
him at the Navy Electronics Laboratory. My other

03:00.403 --> 03:14.198
colleagues there in the Navy, notably Robert 
Dill, he's now director of the West Indies

03:00.403 --> 03:14.198
Laboratory, and David Moore, who's now chief 
scientist of the Deep Sea Drilling Project, and

03:15.781 --> 03:44.472
Edwin Hamilton I guess were very important 
colleagues and influences

03:15.781 --> 03:44.472
I guess these were the perhaps the the major people 
earlier on of course Henry Stetson's work was

03:15.781 --> 03:44.472
important but his most of his ideas were rather 
classical and where he was involved in ideas about

03:45.194 --> 03:58.889
the continental shelf of the slope that I was 
interested in disproving, rather than...

03:58.909 --> 04:14.205
But...

03:58.909 --> 04:14.205
Well, the whole... Well, I think preeminent 
perhaps marine geologist, a person who I knew very

03:58.909 --> 04:14.205
well, had much contact with, and perhaps the 
preeminent marine geologist worldwide, was

04:14.523 --> 04:23.834
Kynan, Philip Kynan, in the Netherlands. And his 
whole grasp of the subject was outstanding, and he

04:25.235 --> 04:36.508
had an important influence upon my thinking and 
work. He particularly

04:41.084 --> 04:50.234
Of course, he developed a concept of turbidity 
currents and did a great job with this. I more or

04:52.536 --> 05:06.231
less tried to follow his model in my work on impact 
structures and astroplanes because I originally

04:52.536 --> 05:06.231
thought that if I published one paper I'd done my 
job and I should forget about it and go on to

04:52.536 --> 05:06.231
something else. He published great groups of 
paper, often repeating himself on turbidity

05:07.173 --> 05:15.284
currents, and he became a sort of a great 
protagonist of the idea. Well, I more or less did

05:16.526 --> 05:33.028
the same thing in terms of astroblemes, that as 
long as I was being cast in the role of being the

05:16.526 --> 05:33.028
protagonist, I might as well live up to that role 
and try to promote these things, even to the point

05:16.526 --> 05:33.028
of being a very aggressive advocate of ideas, 
ideas I wasn't too sure of. But nevertheless,

05:38.114 --> 05:45.962
you're cast in this role, and you have to react by 
trying to defend or promote that point of view. And

05:46.823 --> 05:57.715
so in this regard, I more or less tried to follow the 
model of Philip Koonin and his great protagonism

05:46.823 --> 05:57.715
in favor of turbidity currents. So I would say that 
his works and his philosophy of life was kind of

05:58.877 --> 06:03.842
important. what I attempted to do. Of course, I 
should mention K.O. Emery, too, since he and I were

06:07.048 --> 06:14.259
classmates and roommates for many years, and we 
collaborated in the early years, and his

06:07.048 --> 06:14.259
influence was very important.

06:17.023 --> 06:32.547
Several people have suggested that possibly one 
of the problems that oceanography faced in the

06:17.023 --> 06:32.547
period between about 46 to about 53 or 54, and 
perhaps a little later, was that

06:34.147 --> 06:43.318
I may use it collectively, Scripps, Woods Hole, 
and Lamont,

06:34.147 --> 06:43.318
perhaps had too much of a role in directing 
oceanographic research. That is, that they

06:43.338 --> 06:47.003
perhaps had research funds too tightly held. Was 
this your experience? Would you agree with that?

06:51.328 --> 07:02.382
Well, I agree that they had

06:51.328 --> 07:02.382
funds very tightly held, because they were... 
They were both the receiver and the giver. I mean,

07:07.324 --> 07:21.499
their oceanographers would go to Washington and 
occupy the seats of the people giving grants

07:07.324 --> 07:21.499
within ONR, like Roger Revelle, and people of that 
category. I'm not sure this was bad. This may have

07:25.163 --> 07:27.986
been a good thing. I really can't assess that 
because oceanography did need some focal points

07:31.167 --> 07:58.238
and it needed large amounts of money to support 
ships and oceanographers are a group of

07:31.167 --> 07:58.238
scientists of various disciplines and 
backgrounds whose common bond is needing a ship

07:31.167 --> 07:58.238
and if you look at The failure in the earlier years 
of French oceanography, it is based upon the fact

07:59.247 --> 08:10.482
that the French people and scientists are, as they 
are reported to be, rather prima donnas. And they

08:11.724 --> 08:12.685
couldn't get together. And there was never, every 
French scientist of himself was not big enough to

08:13.427 --> 08:21.578
justify having a ship. But he couldn't 
collaborate with his other people, you know, in

08:22.379 --> 08:29.068
associated fields, to get a nucleus large enough 
to support a ship. But by having Woods Hole and

08:30.263 --> 08:45.243
Lamont and Scripps in this major role as being the 
focal points, this really got oceanography off

08:30.263 --> 08:45.243
the ground. And so I would suggest, in spite of the 
fact there's a certain amount of inbreeding

08:45.984 --> 08:58.600
between people going back and forth to 
Washington, it probably was a good thing.

09:00.335 --> 09:07.025
I think it's fair to say that, for example, Ewing 
and Ravel had different personalities. From what

09:09.148 --> 09:16.038
I can read from Bullard and then my interviews with 
Ravel, I would suggest there are different kinds

09:09.148 --> 09:16.038
of people.

09:17.980 --> 09:22.567
Would you hazard to evaluate their contribution, 
let's say? Or that is, these people who were

09:22.587 --> 09:28.215
important in oceanography, what sort of talent 
did they bring to oceanography?

09:29.967 --> 09:32.430
Well, in the...

09:37.796 --> 09:52.653
I guess sometime in the late 50s, Time magazine put 
together a cover story on oceanography, and there

09:37.796 --> 09:52.653
was sort of a competition about who should be the 
cover picture should be on, whether it should be

09:37.796 --> 09:52.653
Islin, Revell, or Ewing. It turned out to be 
Columbus Islin. This, in my view, was probably the

09:56.517 --> 09:59.080
least appropriate It should have been Morris 
Ewing. And if not Morris Ewing, it should have been

10:03.388 --> 10:05.290
Roger Revelle. Or if not, then thirdly, Columbus 
Islin as being sort of the Mr. Oceanography of the

10:05.710 --> 10:10.876
field. And why Islin really got this billet, I 
don't know. I don't know what was behind it

10:16.283 --> 10:19.086
eventually. But

10:20.247 --> 10:28.577
Revelle and Ewing were distinctly different 
sorts of people. Roger Val is very charismatic,

10:29.215 --> 10:45.076
and he's a great, big, lovable character with many 
foibles, but also a great and very productive

10:29.215 --> 10:45.076
mind.

10:51.345 --> 10:57.433
It always seemed to many of us he was highly 
disorganized, and it always seemed that he was

10:51.345 --> 10:57.433
always... He was always more interested in what he 
didn't know than what he did. I mean, he was always

11:03.193 --> 11:10.062
writing papers and working on the edge of his 
knowledge rather than in those fields where he had

11:03.193 --> 11:10.062
a very firm basis. And so he developed a very sort of 
broad-spectrum view of oceanography.

11:19.716 --> 11:24.923
And while I would say Morris Ewing was a very 
intense... sort of a scientist-scientist,

11:25.882 --> 11:53.273
interested in the data himself, interested in, 
and he held a very tight control over Lamont and

11:25.882 --> 11:53.273
over the use of the ship use, and did a fantastic job 
of data collecting, and

11:25.882 --> 11:53.273
he's now credited, for example, in his book about 
Ewing, which is a rather misdirected book because

11:54.012 --> 12:07.328
it doesn't really hit upon his important 
contributions, which I would never really

11:54.012 --> 12:07.328
deprecate, but it gives him too much credit for 
plate tectonics, which he in fact didn't believe.

12:07.348 --> 12:19.463
He tried to, well, perhaps he did more to prove it by 
trying to disprove it because he began to make it,

12:07.348 --> 12:19.463
he did have the idea and he didn't accept it and he 
began to to collect data, and each time pointing

12:20.033 --> 12:25.060
out why this didn't work. But in the end, of course, 
his colleagues and themselves, they did a sudden

12:25.981 --> 12:32.429
conversion in 67. They suddenly all threw in the 
towel and became drifters. So it was a very

12:37.136 --> 12:38.337
interesting development. And I think Morris 
Ewing is preeminent as a contribution, as a

12:39.258 --> 12:48.150
contributor to the science. I think his name is on 
too many papers. I think he was a

12:51.952 --> 12:58.721
lesser contributor. I mean, sometimes he never 
could have written all these papers by himself.

13:03.828 --> 13:10.898
And he was, it was difficult for him to

13:13.443 --> 13:18.691
to give his colleagues sufficient freedom and 
head, I think, to have them do things on their own.

13:18.851 --> 13:21.375
So he's earned too much control of the data. But, 
well, maybe not, because the productivity of

13:22.597 --> 13:31.131
Lamont and the heroic years of Lamont were doing 
his regime. And Lamont will never be able to do what

13:31.191 --> 13:38.522
it was under Ewing, but he ran a very tight ship 
there. And the people working in that soda

13:39.498 --> 13:56.187
environment always, anyone likes to be their own, 
do their own thing, but he ran a very wonderful

13:39.498 --> 13:56.187
operation, a very tight operation, and certainly 
came out with some marvelous results. Well, in

13:57.910 --> 14:04.020
contrast, Ravel was

14:08.995 --> 14:11.978
extremely successful, of course, in developing 
scripts. He

14:13.780 --> 14:21.088
eventually, of course, left and went to Harvard. I 
don't know the whole story behind that. I think it

14:23.070 --> 14:36.285
was a mistake for him to do so

14:23.070 --> 14:36.285
when he was not appointed chancellor of the campus 
there, but

14:37.497 --> 14:39.479
because I don't see how a man can contribute. I 
don't know if he ever became a very good

14:39.539 --> 14:44.885
demographer. Maybe he did, but certainly it's 
very difficult for a person to suddenly become an

14:44.905 --> 14:53.275
expert in a new field. I'm sure if anyone could do 
it, Ravel could, but anyway, I was sorry to see him

14:54.456 --> 15:00.703
leave the field of oceanography. There was some 
objection to Revell taking over Scripps after the

15:01.392 --> 15:09.621
war, particularly from, if I understand 
correctly, Coral Hubbs and Francis Shepard.

15:12.624 --> 15:15.408
Would you have any idea perhaps why? Was there 
something about it? Well, there was a great sort of

15:18.771 --> 15:27.501
personality clash around Scripps, and I think 
there isn't always any sort of center like that,

15:18.771 --> 15:27.501
and I think it's to be expected.

15:32.476 --> 15:37.082
Ravel and Shepard operated in different manners. 
They were wholly different personalities, and

15:39.606 --> 16:00.053
both Shepard and

15:39.606 --> 16:00.053
Hubbs were sort of non-mathematically oriented, 
and so they really didn't speak much the same

15:39.606 --> 16:00.053
language. Ravel was more versed across the board, 
but he was, uh, and...

16:00.893 --> 16:14.526
Ravel ran, he ran sort of slipshod over people, and 
there's bound to be lots of sparks around. But I

16:15.307 --> 16:24.535
think both, both Hubbs and, uh,

16:15.307 --> 16:24.535
and Shepard had sort of a working relationship. 
They, they, they were, they were not quiet about

16:24.795 --> 16:26.777
it. They were not uncritical. And there's lots of, 
uh,

16:34.002 --> 16:58.592
shots being fired back and forth but i think it was 
done in sort of a good scientific spirit and or they

16:34.002 --> 16:58.592
they didn't tend to bury their differences they 
there were strong differences i think the the sort

16:34.002 --> 16:58.592
of a liaison a certain relationship did survive 
there and they were both i mean both both shepherd

16:34.002 --> 16:58.592
and hubs have been remarkably productive people 
uh

17:02.723 --> 17:04.245
Ravel was very difficult to work with. He wanted 
also to be involved in too many things and too many

17:04.345 --> 17:12.937
papers, which he couldn't really handle. And so if 
something got in his hands, it might sit there on

17:12.997 --> 17:20.688
the bottom of his pile for a year or two. And Shepard 
was extremely impatient about getting things out

17:22.230 --> 17:26.617
and published. And Ravel just had too many irons in 
the fire. And it was too...

17:33.638 --> 17:40.747
So it was just a different manner of working that 
made this a very difficult arrangement.

17:44.992 --> 18:03.595
And I think everyone who got directly involved, 
including myself, had this sort of objection to

17:44.992 --> 18:03.595
his method of operating, but at the same time he 
found him a very delightful person and we really

17:44.992 --> 18:03.595
admired his brilliance and his ability to get 
things done and to inspire people to do things. I

18:04.216 --> 18:22.842
wondered if possibly at that time in 
oceanography, during those years, is that people

18:04.216 --> 18:22.842
such as perhaps Ewing and certainly Revell, 
people who were primarily movers, were needed to

18:04.216 --> 18:22.842
stir up interest or to create interest in this 
newly developing field. Would you agree with

18:22.862 --> 18:27.608
that?

18:29.360 --> 18:31.684
Yeah, I would agree with a part of it. I think heroes 
are made by the conditions. I mean, if you have a

18:37.132 --> 18:39.155
war, you're going to have some heroes. You're 
going to have great generals. And so

18:42.540 --> 18:49.591
heroes are sort of product of the situation and the 
environment. A hero would always step forward.

18:54.757 --> 19:05.149
I think we're very fortunate in oceanography in 
having people as, you know, basically as

18:54.757 --> 19:05.149
outstanding as Revelle and Ewing in these roles.

19:11.016 --> 19:22.789
See, there

19:11.016 --> 19:22.789
was a time when the whole field of geophysics was 
controlled by two or three Scandinavians. Then

19:23.967 --> 19:29.534
oceanography became under SpareDrip, and then 
there was this triumvirate for a decade. Now, of

19:30.275 --> 19:38.586
course, oceanography is much too large to 
identify any people with this amount of influence

19:30.275 --> 19:38.586
or power or control. It's all for the better. I 
mean, we no longer have any heroes unless it's some

19:41.129 --> 19:48.118
sort of very small sub-discipline. This is a 
matter of the size of the field and the way it's

19:49.448 --> 20:07.621
evolved and the fact that we perhaps

19:49.448 --> 20:07.621
look at things a little more sophisticated and 
more critical so we tend to get away from the star

19:49.448 --> 20:07.621
system which is good. I mean the star system is 
probably the bane of existence in certain fields

20:12.432 --> 20:32.230
of hearts and so forth where you have to be a to make 
it you have to have you have to be a star you have to

20:12.432 --> 20:32.230
have a name that people recognize and people know 
and people only know and recognize so many names so

20:12.432 --> 20:32.230
in order to become a in order to become a Cousteau 
you have to knock off Cousteau you see many many

20:12.432 --> 20:32.230
people have tried this they've tried Hans Hans 
Haas, other people who have tried to become

20:32.699 --> 20:40.209
Cousteaus, but they've never really succeeded in 
that role, because it is such a tight star system.

20:40.229 --> 20:43.113
But we, in science, we've gotten away from that, 
which is good. Now, I realize this is very

20:44.755 --> 20:54.889
difficult to do, but in terms of your 
accomplishments, what would you consider your

20:44.755 --> 20:54.889
major accomplishment in oceanography?

20:57.753 --> 20:58.434
In oceanography? Well, I...

21:05.774 --> 21:14.767
I guess my main contributions would be a sort of a 
series of contributions to what we now call plate

21:05.774 --> 21:14.767
tectonics. And with playing an initial role, I 
think it's somewhat,

21:14.827 --> 21:35.578
which was mostly done by Harry Hess, but in 
addition by myself on what is now called seafloor

21:14.827 --> 21:35.578
spreading, and some of the basic ideas of 
continental drift and the dispersion of

21:36.385 --> 21:41.352
continents from Pangea. I think secondarily 
probably the

21:43.315 --> 22:02.022
most important thing I've done is probably

21:43.315 --> 22:02.022
playing an important role in deep submergence 
with getting the

21:43.315 --> 22:02.022
Navy and the country involved in deep 
submersibles deep research submersibles deep

22:02.592 --> 22:31.300
research submersibles program by the way which is 
really not hasn't blossomed of late it went to a

22:02.592 --> 22:31.300
certain point and it kind of has been in doldrums 
since but it's uh I guess it's again kind of

22:02.592 --> 22:31.300
reprogramming along different lines

22:02.592 --> 22:31.300
but uh I haven't uh My papers generally have been 
very, very short and brief and papers involving

22:33.929 --> 22:58.519
synthesis of ideas and rather than I

22:33.929 --> 22:58.519
guess trying to be somewhat interpretive of being 
ahead of my time trying to work in some frontier and

22:33.929 --> 22:58.519
see something a bit differently from other 
people. Why, by the way, are submersibles in the

23:00.592 --> 23:06.160
doler rooms now? Well, the...

23:06.180 --> 23:23.804
We had hoped, for example, that NOAA would have a 
substantial mission in submersibles through the

23:06.180 --> 23:23.804
must office, and this has not really 
materialized. Most of the money in these deep

23:25.006 --> 23:28.911
submergence, it takes really public money to 
develop these things. If we had deep

23:31.665 --> 23:38.494
submersibles, say, one-tenth of one percent, 
which goes into airplane development, we would be

23:31.665 --> 23:38.494
extremely happy.

23:41.498 --> 23:52.993
Many, many, a whole series of submersibles came 
off the line for, in the 60s, like the Luminat and

23:41.498 --> 23:52.993
various aerospace companies were all building 
their own. And none of these have really proved

23:54.275 --> 23:58.240
supportable by private industry. They involved 
either direct government subvention or spin-off

24:00.310 --> 24:09.263
money from aerospace industry based upon their 
government contracts. And so, these have

24:11.066 --> 24:21.681
proved to be very expensive. And for many years, 
the Mercy Submersibles were getting a great deal

24:23.043 --> 24:27.670
of the publicity of oceanography. maybe more than 
half, but we're only doing maybe 10% of the work. So

24:33.004 --> 24:52.746
the Navy funding, although I spoke of this level of 
being several tens of millions of dollars, really

24:33.004 --> 24:52.746
hasn't gone into

24:33.004 --> 24:52.746
programs that I personally would like. It's like 
the Navy oceanography program. They have a very

24:54.327 --> 24:56.610
large oceanography program, but they appear to 
redefine what is oceanography and not much of what

24:57.586 --> 25:26.935
I would call oceanography comes out of it now I 
don't know where all the money goes to in deep

24:57.586 --> 25:26.935
submersibles but it's really it's evident now 
that a good bit of it went into the raising Russian

24:57.586 --> 25:26.935
submarine

24:57.586 --> 25:26.935
but Navy unfortunately has this When they get a 
program like this, they

25:27.488 --> 25:37.158
write regulations that make things very 
difficult to operate. They have safety

25:37.198 --> 25:39.000
operations and so forth. And they get to the point 
where they really can't have the flexibility to

25:39.040 --> 25:47.028
really develop a frontier. And so then they go into 
a training mode whereby they train officers to

25:48.589 --> 25:56.297
operate submersibles. and set up a school, and by 
the time an officer is trained, he's transferred

25:56.682 --> 26:04.790
elsewhere, so he doesn't really stay with the 
program. In other words, they don't have any, the

26:05.611 --> 26:21.567
Navy, among Navy officers, you have, they're 
trained as line officers to be, and not a

26:05.611 --> 26:21.567
specialist, and so they don't really stay with the 
program and become involved in it. Most of the

26:23.188 --> 26:26.031
useful part, or the best part, I suppose, of the the 
Navy Submersible Program is the fact that people

26:27.125 --> 26:38.838
retire from the Navy, they spin off people, and 
these ex-submariners end up as directing Woods

26:27.125 --> 26:38.838
Hole Alvin and other programs like that. In other 
words, they spin off into the civilian side, and

26:38.859 --> 26:56.659
then they specialize and become specialists in 
deep submergence, rather than within the Navy,

26:38.859 --> 26:56.659
because their officers tend to get transferred to 
new posts, new positions, which keep them as

26:38.859 --> 26:56.659
generalists rather than specialists.

26:59.457 --> 27:02.744
The Navy set a role on development in 
deep-suburban. This has been rather

27:02.764 --> 27:04.769
disappointing.

27:07.836 --> 27:10.682
Most of it's so classified, we don't even know what 
they're doing.
