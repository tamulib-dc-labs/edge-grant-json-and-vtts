00:02.410 --> 00:04.813
So much for General Dean. Your personal opinion of 
General Dean seems to be very high. Absolutely. He

00:10.379 --> 00:23.014
wrote a book, of course, just a couple of years 
after he came back to America, discussing his job

00:10.379 --> 00:23.014
in Moscow, and he was, in the book, very negative 
about the Russians. He wrote the title, The

00:23.635 --> 00:26.438
Strange Alliance. Yeah. So... He seemed to become 
more negative right after the end of the war. I am

00:34.583 --> 00:43.517
convinced that, well I won't say I'm convinced, 
but I think General Dean feels the same way I do

00:34.583 --> 00:43.517
about the Russians. I'm probably putting that the 
wrong way in respect to his rank, but I was a full

00:43.597 --> 00:54.675
colonel there and he was a very independent 
general. I might say I feel the same way about the

00:55.583 --> 00:59.106
Russians that I think he does. That's probably the 
best way to put it. I don't think the hardcore

01:01.789 --> 01:10.176
communists will ever, ever change.

01:10.457 --> 01:18.164
Maybe in 40, 50 years, maybe a couple of 
generations, the communist ideologies can

01:10.457 --> 01:18.164
change. Now, a terrible war could have its 
consequences. Maybe new regimes, this is almost

01:24.490 --> 01:29.841
unthinkable. Let's say a new regime is not 
communist in Russia, maybe 50 years, yeah. But in

01:35.693 --> 01:44.592
my lifetime, in your lifetime, I just don't see any 
really change whatsoever in the communist

01:45.263 --> 01:52.750
ideology and the powers-to-be that will always 
assume power in Russia. And I think we are always

01:52.770 --> 01:58.335
going to have the same problems in dealing with 
them.

02:00.337 --> 02:04.340
I... And these are the feelings that you got after 
being in Moscow? My years of experience, yeah. And

02:06.803 --> 02:08.104
reflecting a lot, too. I, when I immediately 
returned from Russia, And I went to the Air War

02:13.495 --> 02:16.459
College for a course in 1950. I

02:16.959 --> 02:22.827
spoke very highly of the Russians. As a matter of 
fact, some of my classmates called me, teased me as

02:22.847 --> 02:27.934
being red or pink Charlie. On the other hand, I 
spoke of the inevitability of a war with Russia. I

02:35.363 --> 02:36.004
just knew it. Inevitable, we'd be in a war with 
Russia. After a few years, several years, five,

02:40.169 --> 02:43.013
six, I began to change that opinion, and 
completely change where, no, it's not

02:43.398 --> 02:50.227
inevitable. As a matter of fact, we might even be 
able to get along with it. But now I've reverted

02:52.810 --> 02:55.674
back to my original. Inevitably, there's got to be 
a war. And it's funny to say it, but it's got to be a

03:02.122 --> 03:06.868
war in order to have world peace. Somewhere or 
other, there's got to be a war. Communism has got to

03:09.925 --> 03:19.737
be controlled some way or other, and I just don't 
see how it's possible to ever control it or stop it

03:09.925 --> 03:19.737
or eliminate it without conflict. May not be us 
major, maybe the Chinese. And you begin to see this

03:22.480 --> 03:25.003
crack. Even the Communists don't believe a lie. 
Oh, that's absolutely. Now, there's a couple of

03:29.849 --> 03:36.517
other people in Moscow that you had relations 
with, and I'd like your impressions of those. One

03:36.557 --> 03:38.700
was George Kennan. George Kennan, from the 
standpoint of dating with the Russians, I never

03:39.187 --> 03:58.146
really talked to him as much as I'd say Ambassador 
Herman or maybe some of my colonel cohorts in the

03:39.187 --> 03:58.146
military, in the mission.

04:03.331 --> 04:07.675
I think Kennan showed his impatience with the 
Russians more than, certainly There was sort of an

04:09.376 --> 04:20.055
aura about the, or an atmosphere about the embassy 
and the military mission. We were in the building

04:20.095 --> 04:25.124
right across the street from the Kremlin. The 
embassy was called Esposo. You've probably seen

04:29.471 --> 04:30.293
it. I think the Attaché's, or whatever you call it 
now, the office, I think it had been moved from the

04:34.165 --> 04:43.115
old place where it used to be, right next to the 
International Hotel across the street from

04:34.165 --> 04:43.115
Kremlin. I think it's a new building in Russia, 
Moscow. I don't know where it is, since I was there.

04:48.300 --> 04:54.487
But there was an aura about, to deal with the 
Russians is difficult. After six months... And

04:56.189 --> 04:59.252
what did Cannon say about this? Oh, I'm sure he felt 
the same way. I don't remember him making a

05:02.161 --> 05:04.043
positive statement. But when you'd fly the 
Ambassador around, Kennan would usually go,

05:04.063 --> 05:08.108
wouldn't he? Oh no, no. He wouldn't? No, no, very 
seldom. Gee, he'd stay there. Yes, Kennan would

05:11.371 --> 05:13.153
stay back and be the chief then. He'd take care of 
the home store while the Ambassador was gone. And I

05:17.118 --> 05:22.584
don't remember spending a lot of time talking to 
him. How did he impress you? I don't remember

05:25.687 --> 05:28.911
thinking very much of him. of what type of person he 
was. He was just a very capable man, did his job

05:31.227 --> 05:36.812
well, and Ambassador Herman seemed satisfied 
with him. I never even dreamed of him at one of these

05:37.352 --> 05:40.515
days being an ambassador level. I don't know. 
Well, I just never thought about it. But I'm not

05:43.939 --> 05:45.020
surprised. Look at me. I was first lieutenant 
colonel, then major general. The colonel, by the

05:49.143 --> 05:57.531
way, I mean the Navy captain was over there for a 
while, eventually became chief of naval

05:49.143 --> 05:57.531
operations, Admiral

05:59.890 --> 06:03.034
It would be Sharktown. I can't remember his name 
now, but he became the chief naval officer.

06:06.800 --> 06:16.534
There's no doubt, to answer one of your questions, 
service of that nature definitely will enhance

06:06.800 --> 06:16.534
the career of a career military man. There's no 
doubt about it. Oh, sure. What about Charles

06:19.057 --> 06:22.302
Boland? Chip Boland. Well, I knew him, Chip. He 
was, to me, one of the... one of the finest State

06:30.215 --> 06:36.442
Department men I think I've ever met, including 
Ambassador Herman. Why do you say that? He

06:37.703 --> 06:41.928
impressed me. First place, he could speak the 
language very well, speak almost perfect

06:42.669 --> 06:47.714
Russian. He impressed you as an able man. He spoke

06:53.361 --> 06:58.146
well. His personal appearance was impressive. He 
looked to me like a diplomat.

07:09.432 --> 07:18.584
He felt, I think, the same way about the Russians 
that I'm telling you I feel about the Russians.

07:18.825 --> 07:26.375
I think at times I remember, if I recall correctly, 
I figured one of these days, I felt like Chip

07:18.825 --> 07:26.375
Boland, but like I did Kirk LeMay. One of these 
days, this man will be an ambassador. And I figured

07:29.969 --> 07:31.851
him out that way. And to go back to Ken, see, I don't 
remember this impression of Ken. I don't mean to

07:37.377 --> 07:40.921
show any disrespect for him, but he just didn't. I 
didn't think of him as ever going to be an

07:40.941 --> 07:44.606
ambassador one of these days. Chip Boland, 
definitely. Why? Because he just was more

07:45.467 --> 07:47.189
brilliant? Or he was just more outgoing? What 
about his personality? Ken's personality was not

07:53.035 --> 07:55.698
near what Boland's was. He was a harder man to know 
to me. Chip Boland was very easy to talk to. Ken, no.

08:07.728 --> 08:16.762
Ken represented to me more of the, if you will, the 
starched, reserved diplomat. Sort of British, a

08:17.383 --> 08:19.806
la British style, if you will. I don't know what 
that means anything. That's the way I look at it.

08:23.672 --> 08:29.541
Whereas Chip Boland is the typical old easygoing 
American.

08:30.584 --> 08:37.973
And

08:30.584 --> 08:37.973
I grew to be very close with Chip Bowen. We were very 
close friends.

08:44.300 --> 08:45.942
We talked about General Dean. There was no other 
real key officer over there that I can. By the way,

08:49.386 --> 08:51.508
we had a doctor with a mission. And we never really 
had any medical problems over there. Let's talk

08:55.193 --> 08:57.055
about life in the embassy, then. How about your 
quarters? Tell me about your quarters. I and about

09:00.014 --> 09:18.143
six other officers lived in the ex-German 
military attaché's home quarters within walking

09:00.014 --> 09:18.143
distance of the embassy and also the Kremlin.

09:19.545 --> 09:23.311
Klebny Paliolik Street, meaning bread. Klebny. 
Charny Kleb, which is black bread in Russian. And

09:28.415 --> 09:30.938
then I learned conversational Russian. I studied 
it religiously every day. I had an interpreter

09:33.622 --> 09:35.164
come in. She'd teach me Russian grammar. It's not 
difficult. I'm very interested in it. Did you get

09:41.052 --> 09:42.213
very proficient? No. I really didn't have a chance 
to. I looked for chances to practice it. And I'd

09:49.102 --> 09:53.128
always talk to my driver and my maids, always doing 
that. But never really on a dedicated sense. So

09:57.203 --> 09:59.325
you, and tell me about your quarters. They were 
very adequate, typical European type quarters,

10:01.447 --> 10:08.813
small beds. We had, I think eight of us lived there, 
and we had 11 servants, including the gardener. So

10:15.800 --> 10:18.062
we were adequately covered. And Lily, I don't even 
remember her last name, but it was always Lily to

10:18.082 --> 10:27.210
me, Latvian, was the, I'd say in her 60s, was the 
head of the house. She ran the household and bossed

10:31.379 --> 10:43.309
all the servants and me being the ranking officer 
of all the Army, Air Force, Navy guys living in the

10:54.292 --> 10:56.415
and she and I would always talk. As a result, we grew 
very close and she could speak good English. And as

11:00.981 --> 11:09.451
a result, I learned to know a little bit about the 
Russian man of the street by talking with her. And

11:10.653 --> 11:14.418
I'll get to a key discussion a little bit later on. 
But the house was warm. Winter was severe. The heat

11:18.182 --> 11:20.265
was adequate. I had a fireplace in my particular 
room. I had sort of, I guess, the best room in the

11:24.031 --> 11:27.015
whole building. It was just a huge home, typical 
wood construction, plaster on the outside. What

11:39.151 --> 11:40.232
about the food? The food was basically 
American-type food.

11:49.675 --> 11:50.676
dishes now and then. Always the main, one of the 
best parts of the meal would be the soup. Many

11:59.345 --> 12:05.051
different kinds of soup, including the old beet 
borscht, which I just loved. We had adequate meat.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.477
Mostly American, shipped in from the United 
States? Oh yes, oh definitely. We ate a lot of

12:15.483 --> 12:16.864
cabbage. As a matter of fact, there's a lot of 
variations I've learned ways to eat cabbage. One

12:22.186 --> 12:27.851
of the best was a cabbage roll with sort of a 
hamburger meat inside. They were terrific cooks,

12:27.911 --> 12:32.176
very dedicated people. I learned to love all of 
them. They were about four or five maids and one or

12:36.540 --> 12:43.347
two gardeners. I didn't get to know them very well. 
They were men. And then I think it was one or two

12:46.240 --> 12:49.263
house maintenance people. Were they all elderly? 
Yeah, all of them. All of them. Well, one of the

12:53.466 --> 13:02.975
maids, I

12:53.466 --> 13:02.975
think her name was Massimova, I believe. She was 
the youngest one. I'd say she was in her late 20s. I

13:07.198 --> 13:08.359
don't know much about her. She spoke broken 
English. Very courteous. And she was usually the

13:12.563 --> 13:16.146
one waiting on us at the table. We had normal 
breakfast, normal lunch, and normal dinner.

13:23.813 --> 13:38.687
We

13:23.813 --> 13:38.687
lived comfortably, ate well, and had our liquor 
supplies, although sometimes we ran out of

13:23.813 --> 13:38.687
everything. We never ran out of vodka. We could 
always get vodka locally, either potato vodka or

13:39.808 --> 13:45.593
wheat vodka. How about the telephones? Do you 
think that the phones or do you think that the rooms

13:50.602 --> 13:53.687
were bugged? I always expected any place I was, 
including the vehicle I was traveling in, to be

13:53.707 --> 14:01.780
bugged. As a matter of fact, we were briefed this 
way. All of us had to be very careful. So you never

14:08.812 --> 14:09.994
had political conversations while you were in 
your room with others or at the dinner table or

14:10.227 --> 14:16.135
anything like that? Oh, we'd drop our guard at 
times and get to talking. I'm sure many times we

14:20.700 --> 14:26.428
said things we shouldn't be talking about and I'm 
sure were picked up. As a matter of fact, when I was

14:26.448 --> 14:40.065
over there, and you may recall this, is the time 
that they subsequently found a vibrating

14:26.448 --> 14:40.065
transmitter type like you find in the receiver of a 
telephone that was behind the President's seal or

14:40.467 --> 14:55.966
the Ambassador's seal in the main dining, in the 
main ballroom of the Esposo house that across the

14:40.467 --> 14:55.966
street a Russian transmitter microwave was 
spotted on. That thing was in there at that time. We

14:58.569 --> 15:00.972
didn't know it. Ingenious, ingenious methods of 
eavesdropping. We had our security service man

15:08.294 --> 15:21.113
that I talked to you about, I took him over to the 
safe and all, and we had his little, he had his own

15:08.294 --> 15:21.113
little very secure room in the building there by 
the, across the street from the Kremlin. And of

15:21.133 --> 15:23.917
course we had our own debugging equipment. Did you 
ever find any bugs in your quarters? I don't recall

15:29.365 --> 15:33.171
finding any. Could you sort of give me your typical 
routine for the average day when you weren't

15:33.421 --> 15:40.187
flying, but I mean, taking the Ambassador 
someplace? Routine day would be get up and have

15:40.708 --> 15:43.710
breakfast. About what time? Oh, anywhere from 6 to 
7, something like that, for the work day. Yeah,

15:53.599 --> 15:55.441
that's what we're talking about. And be up. Many 
times I would walk to work just for the exercise,

15:56.101 --> 16:01.386
but in the inclement weather or if I had real urgent 
business, I would have a chauffeur. The chauffeur

16:04.953 --> 16:06.415
would be waiting outside. At the entrance, at the 
gate entrance, were always stood two NKVD guards,

16:07.676 --> 16:16.164
Russian Army Guards. They had them posted 
outside. They stayed there 24 hours a day. They

16:19.067 --> 16:24.712
even had their little cubby boxes to get back into, 
you know, every now and then. But I'd get to work

16:25.613 --> 16:30.478
around, somewhere around, between 8 and 9. 
Rather, a lot of, most of the time sort of boring

16:31.252 --> 16:38.459
duties and looking for things to do.

16:41.441 --> 16:49.268
The Russian newspapers were Russian and the only 
thing really I could get out of them was looking at

16:41.441 --> 16:49.268
the pictures. Of course, nothing compared to our 
newspapers, no such thing as an advertisement.

16:55.994 --> 17:01.039
I'm talking about Pravda, TASS, that was one or two 
others. I would, although it was not my duty, and I

17:01.711 --> 17:11.503
had to be very discreet about this and was told and 
briefed to be very discreet about it, I was not an

17:01.711 --> 17:11.503
intelligence man. I was there to help the 
Russians, and therefore I'd compromise my

17:13.606 --> 17:27.744
capability if they ever started suspecting me as a 
typical attache that obviously had intelligence

17:13.606 --> 17:27.744
gathering as one of my functions. There's no doubt 
they considered me that way. No doubt. Any and all

17:31.529 --> 17:34.473
of us included as intelligent general people. 
They looked up on us. The Russians are suspicious

17:36.535 --> 17:38.638
people. They're suspicious people. I'm talking 
about the hardcore people now. No, what did you

17:42.642 --> 17:44.465
usually do in the morning? Did you brief the 
ambassador? I keep getting off the subject. No,

17:47.789 --> 17:48.710
no. No, I never bothered the ambassador except 
only when he called. Every once in a while we'd

17:54.116 --> 17:58.161
have- Did General Dean brief you? Sort of keep you 
up on top of the situation? If I had a particular

18:00.538 --> 18:22.426
project, like I was preparing a trip to the 
Ambassador, I would keep General Dean briefed

18:00.538 --> 18:22.426
about the prospects of weather and maybe, you 
know, General Dean ought to keep the airplane at

18:00.538 --> 18:22.426
Cairo for a day or two longer to get an engine 
change, something like that. Or if I... knew some

18:27.487 --> 18:42.445
visitor, some VIP-type visitor was coming over, 
like the weatherman, to have some talks with his

18:27.487 --> 18:42.445
counterparts for collaboration and liaison and 
cooperation. Then we'd have to make plans. And I'd

18:44.107 --> 18:47.230
say, well, I've got the choker all lined up. And 
we'd call over through the interpreter. We always

18:49.112 --> 18:51.455
had to use an interpreter to make the appointment. 
And a meeting is set up at 9 o'clock. And sometimes,

18:53.217 --> 18:55.620
General Dean would go on some of these meetings. I 
would escort him. I'd go with him. A specific

18:59.306 --> 19:22.131
example, General Dean and I visited the chief of, 
one of the, he wasn't the chief of staff, but he was

18:59.306 --> 19:22.131
one of the top men of the Russian Red Air Force, to 
give him, actually present to him, an Air Force

18:59.306 --> 19:22.131
bomb site. And we'd never done this before, but we 
knew that he had them. Because somewhere he'd been

19:27.794 --> 19:32.439
shot down and recovered. So we knew they had the 
bomb site. We weren't given anything they didn't

19:33.861 --> 19:35.402
have. But we presented the general. I can't 
remember his name, by the way. He was Colonel

19:41.789 --> 19:46.053
General. Colonel General was the one with the 
three star.

19:52.958 --> 19:55.340
Very fine and very impressive man. He's one of the 
few generals that I remember with, and I remember

19:55.540 --> 20:02.586
this right today. He's one of the very few Russian 
generals that, and General Dean agrees with this.

20:09.132 --> 20:12.094
We walked back from the meeting from the Kremlin, 
we were talking about it. He talked freely to us

20:13.115 --> 20:22.763
after we gave him the bombsight and, you know, 
passing the social dimensions of the day. We got

20:23.452 --> 20:51.687
upon the subject of cooperation between 
Americans and the Russians, and he talked very

20:23.452 --> 20:51.687
freely about he wished, you know, that we're very 
much alike, and there's no reason for us to, you

20:23.452 --> 20:51.687
know, together there's no reason we'll easily 
defeat Hitler, you know, and Mussolini, and he

20:23.452 --> 20:51.687
wished things could be better where it would be 
easier for him and us to have meetings. The routine

20:52.038 --> 20:58.567
you'd have to go through with arranging a meeting 
is just, it would take maybe two or three days. And

20:59.388 --> 21:07.939
these were people we were supposed to be talking to 
daily, you know, for liaison and cooperation and

20:59.388 --> 21:07.939
winning the war effort. But the routine you'd have 
to go through with, well, for instance, it took us a

21:07.959 --> 21:19.294
month to get permission to go through the...

21:20.219 --> 21:25.106
surrounding defenses of Moscow to go out and have a 
picnic on the banks of the Volga River. It took a

21:25.126 --> 21:27.810
month to get permission for different kinds of 
people to do this. Again, security. But getting

21:30.414 --> 21:39.007
off the subject, getting back on your routine, 
that would be a typical part of my job. I would see

21:39.949 --> 21:43.594
some pictures of Russian, new Russian airplanes.

21:47.152 --> 21:52.297
diplomatic mail pouch which was free from 
inspection. I'd send those back home and I'd do my

21:52.477 --> 21:58.303
best from a standpoint of intelligence. I'd 
actually sit down and write sort of memos for the

21:58.524 --> 22:16.382
record of my impressions or maybe discussions 
with a particular general or when I'd meet some of

21:58.524 --> 22:16.382
the lower ranking operational Red Air Force pilot 
types at the front. Like when we visited the front

22:21.402 --> 22:31.853
at Lavoe, Poland, where the Russians were taking 
that

22:21.402 --> 22:31.853
city back, and I actually got to talk to some of the 
fighter pilots. You know, I'd come back and make a

22:32.354 --> 22:35.797
memo for the record of my impressions of them. Very 
impressive guys. Okay, so let's then switch from

22:37.739 --> 22:46.048
your routine and let's talk about your field 
visits. How many did you have during those

22:46.535 --> 22:51.363
thirteen months? We made a visit to

22:51.383 --> 22:58.373
Leningrad. Basically you'd work like an eight to 
five day, five days a week. Oh yeah, okay. So you

23:04.383 --> 23:06.586
made a visit up to Leningrad. Wait, you made a visit 
to Leningrad and that was just before New Year's of

23:06.606 --> 23:14.719
43 and 44. and actually that was while it was under 
artillery siege from the Germans, but was never

23:15.003 --> 23:23.793
taken. No. And they had actual air raid, if you 
will, air raid alert procedures against

23:24.934 --> 23:41.432
artillery barrages, and at the time we were there 
we heard none of them, but we were taken to a

23:41.969 --> 23:48.560
building at one time, and two binoculars could 
observe German observation posts. It was that

23:48.580 --> 23:50.604
close to the city. I took another trip with General 
Joe Cannon. What did you think of Leningrad? Tell

23:57.836 --> 23:58.397
me about that. Very impressive city. Yeah, but 
what did they do? Why did they take you up on this

24:02.580 --> 24:04.782
trip to begin with? Why did they take you out of 
Moscow? Supply. It was a supply mission to the

24:06.925 --> 24:09.127
field. See, we had a right. Let's say we were 
sending them supplies, so we felt we had a right to

24:10.208 --> 24:24.504
go out to the ports where these supplies would 
arrive and sort of touch base with the local people

24:10.208 --> 24:24.504
that were doing this work. And this was primarily, 
I think, a Navy mission. At one time, we wanted to go

24:30.434 --> 24:34.658
on up to Murmansk, but never got that chance to do 
that. It was too difficult to arrange. But the

24:37.120 --> 24:44.126
Visits Leningrad, we talked to some of the Navy 
officials. I do remember taking a motor trip

24:44.146 --> 24:50.592
through the port area and seeing their naval 
facilities, but never even got out of the car. We

24:52.234 --> 24:59.260
were oriented mostly to the arts and cultures of 
Leningrad, which were just fantastic,

24:52.234 --> 24:59.260
beautiful. So they took us more or less on a tourist 
trip, primarily. And of course, briefed us on the

25:05.268 --> 25:07.531
threat. Sure, how'd it look? It must have looked 
terrible after they were under siege for about

25:08.472 --> 25:11.817
three years. That's right. Well, actually, the 
best way I can describe any place we saw in Russia

25:12.678 --> 25:18.307
was bleak. Bleak, bleak, bleak. And everything 
blacked out at night. No lights. How'd the people

25:27.370 --> 25:29.052
look, Dave? During this time they were eating 
horses. Oh, yes, it's obvious. Well, matter of

25:32.617 --> 25:51.384
fact, I saw,

25:32.617 --> 25:51.384
at night I looked out the hotel window and saw

25:32.617 --> 25:51.384
people dragging corpse on a sled, you know, it was 
winter time, frozen street, dragging corpse on a

25:32.617 --> 25:51.384
sled, probably taking to the cemetery. Oh, they 
were, the rationing was very severe. Leningrad

25:55.670 --> 25:57.632
was under siege, like you say. And I guess that's 
one reason they wanted, they were glad to take us to

25:58.413 --> 26:02.418
Leningrad. They could show us the difficulties 
and the horrors which Russia was confined with to,

26:02.438 --> 26:13.191
you know, to prod us on, to give us more supplies, 
more supplies. They need more supplies. And, of

26:14.592 --> 26:20.059
course, we poured, just poured the supplies into 
Russia. The food, armor, you name it. No telling

26:24.104 --> 26:25.305
how much we did. Then I took another trip to the 
front, Leveaux, Poland, like I told you when I was

26:26.635 --> 26:35.646
taking this strictly tactical, very tactical 
trip, very interesting. Saw the Red Army

26:36.006 --> 26:40.371
operating in the field with the Red, primarily the 
Red Air Force. A couple of forward, advanced

26:40.712 --> 26:51.725
forward bases where the fighters, mostly P-63, 
P-39, the ones we gave, P-39 aircraft. They were

26:51.745 --> 26:54.448
operating in quite a lot of those, and they loved 
the airplanes. They loved the cannon in it. We had

26:57.292 --> 27:02.639
a, I think it was a 20 or 30 millimeter gun, one gun 
right out of the nose of the P-39. They loved that.

27:04.161 --> 27:06.644
And they kept saying they loved the 
maneuverability of it. And I never could

27:06.804 --> 27:09.687
understand that because I hated the airplane. But 
what they meant was they loved the rate of climb. It

27:12.811 --> 27:18.999
so happened that old airplane had the best rate of 
climb of any airplane we had in the inventory at

27:12.811 --> 27:18.999
that time. And they liked the airplane. And one 
more of them. I think we must have given Russia

27:21.882 --> 27:25.026
about 14,000 of those airplanes. Tell me about the 
conditions on the front, and how many went? How

27:29.739 --> 27:32.902
many of you people went up there? Well, of course, 
we escorted General Cannon, a visiting general

27:32.922 --> 27:41.291
from the Italian front, a tactical air commander 
in Italy. He promised him a trip to the front, and

27:42.312 --> 27:46.217
this is what we were doing. I went with him. Did 
General Dean go? No, General Dean didn't go on.

27:52.944 --> 27:55.907
General Dean went on a Leningrad trip with me. But I 
think that's the only trip I went with General

27:56.073 --> 27:59.439
Dean. Of course, we visited shuttle bases several 
times down in Ukraine, but on the trip with about

27:59.479 --> 28:12.944
three or four of us, Army General, whatever the 
condition was, very primitive. It was obvious

28:13.325 --> 28:20.157
they had gone out of their way to even calcify an old 
farm building. with, you know, paint the walls

28:21.368 --> 28:24.672
white with council lines. Sure. And had some army 
bumps with new blankets. Incidentally, they were

28:29.599 --> 28:33.684
United States blankets. And being suspicious of 
them, I think they arranged that purposely, so

28:33.704 --> 28:41.454
that, you know, they were using that equipment. It 
was comfortable, but very primitive. Bedbugs,

28:45.680 --> 28:47.542
number one, every place. Realized bedbugs? Hell, 
yeah. And flies, oh, I remember eating the soup.

28:56.420 --> 29:06.594
Actually, you'd have to take your spoon and push 
the flies away from a part of the soup in the bowl and

28:56.420 --> 29:06.594
then get a quick soup, a spoonful, to take it 
without any flies. And you didn't want to

29:07.135 --> 29:08.857
embarrass them. And then actually making a 
comment to you, seeing what you were doing, oh,

29:08.877 --> 29:13.083
don't worry about it, they're not bad. Were they 
eating them? Oh, yeah. Well, I don't know whether

29:16.828 --> 29:18.310
they were eating flies. I know I didn't eat them. 
They seem adept at getting them out of the way more

29:20.363 --> 29:23.588
so than I am. I guess they were used to it. The

29:25.170 --> 29:31.880
Russian commanders in the field were very 
impressive. As a matter of fact, I distinctly

29:31.960 --> 29:42.396
remember on that particular trip, the Red Air 
Force tactical commander was not in the air. He

29:42.616 --> 29:46.302
rode in the advanced tank of the army. He was with 
the army commander. That's where he rode in that

29:48.798 --> 29:51.142
tank, not the air. And he commanded from that tank? 
That's right. He called in airstrikes right from

29:54.507 --> 29:57.331
the advanced tanks? That's right. He was right 
with the Army commander at all times. Correlating

30:02.259 --> 30:04.142
the Air Force and the Army. What was your opinion of 
that? I was impressed. As a matter of fact,

30:08.148 --> 30:16.982
you see over there at that time, and I think perhaps 
still so, the red tactical the tactical air forces

30:17.384 --> 30:43.560
are under the army they're part of the army see at 
that time we really were too we were the united

30:17.384 --> 30:43.560
states army air corps yeah i know uh but uh i still 
think our uh air support philosophy is superior to

30:17.384 --> 30:43.560
theirs well let's not get into that i want to talk 
about this this visit now yeah and so what about

30:17.384 --> 30:43.560
tell me about some of some of the other conditions 
well uh Let me finish. So you were sleeping in

30:44.466 --> 30:49.432
bedbugs, and you were eating off trees with flies. 
The food was adequate, and vodka. They just poured

30:51.654 --> 30:54.638
the vodka to us continually. And in a lot of cases, 
thank goodness, because it was sort of a dreary

30:54.658 --> 30:59.864
atmosphere. We didn't get to see, we didn't hear 
guns shooting. We didn't get to that point, but we

31:04.430 --> 31:06.092
were. You weren't that close. No, not at the Army 
front. But we were at the air front, where the

31:10.051 --> 31:13.296
advanced support bases were. This was strictly 
for air support, because General Cannon was an air

31:13.316 --> 31:18.243
support tactical air commander. That's what they 
wanted to show him. We just saw a lot of P-39s on the

31:21.368 --> 31:26.676
periphery of the field with bent propellers. And 
their supply, like I said, we gave them so many and

31:27.095 --> 31:38.951
they were advancing in such mass movements that 
they'd bum up an airplane and just push it over the

31:27.095 --> 31:38.951
side and see they had more in reserve. We were just 
pouring airplanes into them. Everything they did

31:42.896 --> 31:47.782
in those big pushes, everything mass, mass, mass. 
M-A-S-S, that was their philosophy. and I saw rear

31:51.412 --> 32:00.466
echelons of supply and support for the Army going 
down the muddy roads past the air base. I can't

32:01.006 --> 32:06.334
recall seeing a paved road in Russia outside of any 
city. I have yet to see a paved road outside of any

32:06.354 --> 32:12.704
city, and I flew around over the area of Russia on an 
airplane. And it was, you saw a lot of mud. Oh, and it

32:14.887 --> 32:20.676
was, it was the It's sort of like you see in the 
movies. Bedraggled column that looked like it was

32:23.320 --> 32:30.350
intermingled with refugees, but this was all 
military supply. What about the- Wagons going by

32:30.371 --> 32:32.433
horses. Yeah. Typical old country wagons stacked 
with you name it. I'm sure some was ammunition. I'm

32:41.787 --> 32:46.714
sure some was food, clothing, medical. a medical 
wagon that reminded me of something I've seen in

32:47.302 --> 32:56.052
pictures of Civil War Red Cross. Drawn to horses. 
And it mixed with artillery drawn to horses. But

33:01.658 --> 33:03.620
they were moving it up. And like they always said, 
you know, they could see doubts in my eyes, I guess,

33:04.601 --> 33:13.391
but gee, this is the best you got. It works. It 
works. It killed Germans. That's how they'd

33:16.394 --> 33:18.076
respond? Always. It killed Germans. And the key 
general, I think he was equivalent to a lieutenant

33:21.481 --> 33:32.074
general, the army commander at the front. I 
remember us talking to him and mentioning, you

33:32.455 --> 33:38.583
know, our relations at Moscow. I wish we could talk 
more than anything. And I remember him saying

33:40.677 --> 34:02.998
this, and I don't even recall, of course we had 
Russians traveling with us, obviously members of

33:40.677 --> 34:02.998
the political gang up there, and he made the 
comment that, through the interpreter to I and

33:40.677 --> 34:02.998
General Cannon, oh, the further you get from 
Moscow, the easier it is to talk. We have no

34:03.679 --> 34:04.259
problem. The further you get from Moscow, the 
easier it is to get things done. It reminded me of a

34:07.442 --> 34:10.245
very typical saying in America, you know, You 
can't get anything done at the Pentagon, so I abhor

34:10.428 --> 34:14.553
the duty. And I'm sure this was, in other words, 
here was a typical serviceman talking to another

34:14.573 --> 34:24.605
typical serviceman, and obviously you have the 
same problems no matter what country you're in.

34:24.886 --> 34:27.128
The further you get away from headquarters, the 
easier it is. I was shown a Sturmovik airplane.

34:31.774 --> 34:39.203
This was their attack airplane, which we were 
very, very interested in in the United States at

34:31.774 --> 34:39.203
that time. and which incidentally we never did 
copy until just recently, and we now have the A-10,

34:39.824 --> 34:52.605
the tank buster, which the Air Force has got, which 
to me is really essentially that same type of

34:39.824 --> 34:52.605
attack airplane, the Sturmwaffe. It was 
armor-plated all across the front. It was an

34:56.332 --> 35:05.427
inline engine and had bomb bays in the wings, and it 
was essentially a tank buster, if you will.

35:05.761 --> 35:07.544
necessarily had an armor plate on the front. It was 
primarily a ground support type airplane, a slow

35:07.664 --> 35:22.030
airplane, easy prey for a fighter to knock down, 
and always operating at low altitude. Usually

35:22.050 --> 35:27.519
they escorted it with P-39s or some other type 
fighter, a Yak type fighter. And the pilot all this

35:31.259 --> 35:36.406
through an interpreter course all the time and of 
course this is where I really got interested in

35:31.259 --> 35:36.406
things. I was asked questions from out of the zoo 
and they opened a little hatch on the top of the wing

35:36.567 --> 35:59.359
and showed me the little bomb bay and in this bomb 
bay which was about a foot wide and maybe three feet

35:36.567 --> 35:59.359
long running between the ribs of the wing was I 
guess about Must have been eight or ten. Looked to

36:02.441 --> 36:14.460
me like a French 75-millimeter round with three 
little fins, metal fins, welded on the end of it.

36:15.741 --> 36:20.128
Now, this was a bomb, and it wasn't in Iraq. They 
just laid in there, and they were all rusty, all

36:20.168 --> 36:24.655
covered with rust. Now, this was the bomb load of 
that airplane. It had two on each side. I mean, it

36:29.353 --> 36:35.301
had a total of about maybe 30 or 40 of these. What was 
your opinion of that? Well, you can imagine. As a

36:38.525 --> 36:48.718
matter of fact, I'm sure if I recall, I did try to 
restrain my appearance on my face in questioning,

36:38.525 --> 36:48.718
what in the world? And again, you know, it killed 
Russians. And I think I do remember, I think I did,

36:52.132 --> 36:59.839
well I asked, this looks like 75, and I think he did 
say, yes, it's 75. We made bombs out of them.

37:02.542 --> 37:07.486
Incidentally, while in Leningrad, I did go to a 
munitions factory where I saw them making bombs.

37:07.967 --> 37:09.488
But not these things. These were rusty. And he told 
me that he'd make the dive on a target, whatever he

37:11.510 --> 37:19.397
was tacking on, and then he'd pull a lever in the 
cockpit, and it opened the door on the bottom, and

37:20.727 --> 37:25.772
they just landed on the door. When they opened the 
door, they just fell out. And they would explode on

37:27.814 --> 37:32.059
impact. And that's all they were. But he said they 
killed Russians. I mean, killed Germans. I'll

37:38.185 --> 37:39.146
never forget that. Not very effective. Well,

37:42.249 --> 37:47.815
they swore by the storm of And the German, we've 
learned from the Germans that it was a very

37:48.250 --> 37:59.703
effective airplane, but they lost a lot of the 
German fighters.

38:00.624 --> 38:06.231
On the other hand, the Russians along that front 
had shot down many German aircraft. The elite of

38:06.891 --> 38:18.004
the German fighters were oriented against our 8th 
and 15th Air Forces, you know, the attacks on

38:06.891 --> 38:18.004
Germany proper. top pilots, the best of the German 
Air Force, was not on the Russian front. And all air

38:24.716 --> 38:30.946
battles were never above 15,000 feet, something 
like that. A lot of, there was a lot of air support

38:30.966 --> 38:41.964
for the German Army, Stuka type aircraft, which 
was easy targets for the Russian fighters to shoot

38:30.966 --> 38:41.964
down. I think at that time, I believe, I remember 
his name, Poprishkin. He was the top ace of the Red

38:46.393 --> 38:48.656
Air Force. I think he had 54 to his credit at that 
time. Fifty-four. That's fantastic. Did you meet

38:56.145 --> 38:57.507
him? No, I didn't. I never did meet him in person. 
But the conditions on that front were primitive.

39:04.897 --> 39:09.022
How about the soldiers and the airmen that you saw, 
the pilots that you saw? How did they look? The... I

39:13.418 --> 39:15.862
didn't see any actual maintenance facility. This 
was probably an advanced staging base. Actually

39:20.730 --> 39:25.037
an advanced forward attack base, really, and 
there were no maintenance facilities on the base.

39:25.057 --> 39:26.419
It was just open field. Like you'd find an open 
meadowland with a fence wire around it in, let's

39:27.901 --> 39:40.962
say, western Texas, with a few bum airplanes 
parked around the periphery. aircraft had

39:41.245 --> 39:44.531
recovered this field and landed in the direction. 
I saw no evidence at this time of even supply

39:44.551 --> 39:51.163
trucks, you know, that would rebomb and bomb them 
up. It may have been very well just a recovery base

39:51.183 --> 40:02.143
where they'd land and then maybe refuel and go back 
to the rear supply base, but I don't remember even

39:51.183 --> 40:02.143
seeing any refueling trucks. Did you see any 
aircraft? Did planes come in? I saw planes flying

40:06.108 --> 40:13.638
in the air, but there was never an airplane landed 
or recovered at that particular base where I was at

40:06.108 --> 40:13.638
the time. How about at other bases on that front? I 
didn't visit any of the other bases. Why'd they

40:17.403 --> 40:19.145
take you here instead? That's a good question. It 
seems kind of strange that they'd take you here

40:20.407 --> 40:22.910
instead. Any particular trip, and I remember you 
talking to me about your trip over there, and I

40:22.930 --> 40:32.042
think I asked you sort of a leading question. He 
said you could take pictures and they told you to

40:32.225 --> 40:35.829
take pictures of anything you see. But did they say 
that you could go any place you wanted to go? That

40:38.993 --> 40:39.653
was my question. You couldn't get there. And 
obviously you weren't going to go any place you

40:41.455 --> 40:45.099
wanted to go. All of these trips were laid out in 
advance. It took General Cannon, he had to stay

40:48.283 --> 40:52.908
over another week. His trip was laid on for about 
three days and he ended up staying about ten days in

40:53.389 --> 40:58.815
Moscow. It took that long for them to finally lay on 
an airplane and take him to the front. And I'm sure

41:06.101 --> 41:14.388
the reason they did it is that he finally got 
permission from the ambassador to tell Molotov

41:06.101 --> 41:14.388
that he was tired of waiting. He had a war to fight on 
his own, and he was leaving. He wanted to go back.

41:20.053 --> 41:21.014
Just forget everything. The next morning, they 
called and said his trip's late on. That's one of

41:26.879 --> 41:29.222
the things I'll never forget. Here is an American 
who said, look, I'm not messing around any longer.

41:35.299 --> 41:35.679
Forget it. I'm going home. Then they let him go. And 
I think part of this, however, was preparations

41:38.643 --> 41:43.248
for his trip. They had to make preparations. For 
instance, I told you in order. Sure, and so then

41:46.412 --> 41:51.218
they took the general out to an airstrip where you 
don't even see any airplanes land, didn't they?

41:51.759 --> 41:53.541
Well, they had airplanes for us to inspect. They 
showed us, they had a story for us to show us. They

41:56.565 --> 41:58.027
had a P-39 to show us. And that was the first? It's 
strictly, yeah, you say it's a trip to the front.

42:01.645 --> 42:06.771
But, you know, oh by the way, they showed us a little 
U-2. It was similar to a training airplane that I

42:07.091 --> 42:10.895
soloed in. It was a little tiny bug plane. But you 
never saw any action, did you? We were briefed.

42:18.644 --> 42:21.567
Briefed, you know, with maps and all, showing 
where the troops are and all. I don't remember

42:21.607 --> 42:25.771
actually hearing any artillery bombs. And they 
say they won't, they They didn't want to protect

42:28.595 --> 42:30.237
us. They didn't want to expose us to any danger. 
They were always careful to say this. But you

42:34.322 --> 42:36.284
didn't even see any operations done. And so you 
flew out there for how long? You stayed overnight?

42:40.869 --> 42:41.830
Yes, I stayed overnight. And then you flew right 
back? And I was glad to leave. And then I was right

42:44.233 --> 42:45.374
back. General Cairns was disgusted. I bet you he 
was disgusted. His remarks was, how in the world

42:49.940 --> 42:53.584
can an outfit like this win a war? You know, 
comments of that nature. Of course, I'd gotten,

42:58.058 --> 43:05.007
I'd been over there about six months at this time, 
and I'd seen so much of it that, you know, I didn't

42:58.058 --> 43:05.007
get upset like he did. So I just looked at him and 
grinned. But now, when we was forced to, and then I

43:08.231 --> 43:13.337
think, well, of course, we made a lot of other trips 
to the front. Well, tell me about some of those. But

43:14.859 --> 43:18.163
before I get to those, these are routine. We had, 
you know, it's our own course of recovery. But on

43:20.206 --> 43:25.753
the way to one of the trips to Cairo, I had lost 
number three engines. I lost the, I was losing

43:25.835 --> 43:30.001
number three engine because of oil pressure, so I 
had to cut it off. So we had to land. And we happened

43:31.624 --> 43:36.171
to be approaching Vladivostok on the way down to 
Tehran. I had the ambassador on board, Geraldine.

43:40.498 --> 43:41.720
Vladivostok? Vladivostok is, I'm sorry, I'm 
sorry. You'd be gone. Stalingrad. Stalingrad.

43:49.151 --> 43:50.153
You'd be gone. Yeah. About 5,000 miles out of your 
way. I wish that I could have taken a trip like that

43:52.775 --> 43:56.640
one time. Stalingrad. Okay, you're going down to 
Stalingrad on a Volga. We always flew right over

43:59.323 --> 44:01.185
Stalingrad, you know. It was checkpoint on the 
Tehran bus route. Well, you were there right

44:03.849 --> 44:06.712
during, no, a little bit after. This is after. This 
is after it turned out, and I had to land. I always

44:13.761 --> 44:18.286
had to carry a Russian radio operator and 
navigator aboard my airplane on every flight.

44:18.447 --> 44:19.568
This is what they required. I couldn't fly any 
place. Well, what did you think about that? I

44:22.683 --> 44:23.684
didn't object to it. I told him Brampton didn't 
need him. But he said, well, did he bother you? And I

44:27.069 --> 44:27.710
said, no. He said, well, there's no saying 
anything about it. Words of that nature. And they

44:31.395 --> 44:41.549
never did bother me,

44:31.395 --> 44:41.549
except one time I ordered a navigator out of my 
cockpit, but that's another story. But we had to

44:42.009 --> 44:42.730
land. Was he fooling around? No. We had a problem of 
being lost in a snowstorm. He didn't know where we

44:49.646 --> 44:53.472
were, and he was scared to death, and I woke my 
navigator up there. But that was a return flight

44:53.492 --> 44:57.278
from the Tehran conference. But in this 
particular case, we had the land. And I, through

45:00.402 --> 45:09.316
the interpreter, I told the Russian navigator to 
contact the base at Stalingrad and get permission

45:00.402 --> 45:09.316
to land there. So he did, and we were cleared. So we 
came into Stalingrad. Now, this was seeing

45:12.140 --> 45:14.884
emergency landing, if you will. So I knew no 
preparation could be made for this. And I learned

45:18.716 --> 45:26.125
later on that, oh man, this caused consternation 
from Stalingrad up through the channel and clear

45:18.716 --> 45:26.125
back to Moscow. The ambassador of the United 
States going into Stalingrad had just been

45:26.345 --> 45:31.211
cleared out, you know. It was still really an alert 
combat base. It's just rubble. Oh, goodness,

45:36.117 --> 45:37.999
yeah. And I came in and landed. And of course, he 
made me leave. The crew started working on the

45:44.497 --> 45:45.959
airplane. In the meantime, the scrambled 
arrangements that the Russians had to make to meet

45:45.979 --> 45:59.494
the ambassador and take him someplace in the city, 
and the crew and all, the ambassador, and Kathy, I

45:45.979 --> 45:59.494
think. Yeah, the girl was with us. Her daughter was 
with us on that trip. And I'm sure we caused the

46:03.880 --> 46:12.850
greatest upset in that nation for that week, just 
for that landing. Somehow they had an old beat up

46:12.998 --> 46:19.928
automobile, I don't know why, it was a Russian type 
vehicle of some sort. It looked like maybe some old

46:21.490 --> 46:25.296
pickup that some farmer had in Texas. Just what 
they brought out to pick up the ambassador in.

46:28.260 --> 46:29.021
That's all they had. Yeah, that's all they had. But 
again, it worked. It ran. That's the Russian, it

46:34.009 --> 46:35.391
worked. And they, of course, they took him and 
said, I don't even know where he stayed, but... We

46:42.277 --> 46:45.280
ended up after they took me around. You stayed with 
the plane? No. See, we had to stay overnight. And it

46:50.406 --> 46:52.588
was only in the afternoon. So you landed in the 
afternoon, and they came out with his pickup, and

46:52.608 --> 46:57.693
they took the ambassador. Took him away first, and 
then General Dean stayed with me and the crew for a

46:57.733 --> 47:02.078
while. And then we took Kathy with him, I think. 
First objective, of course, to take him away.
