WEBVTT

00:01.550 --> 00:05.676
He was there when they were fighting in Japan.

00:08.319 --> 00:09.801
Well, he was there.

00:14.748 --> 00:23.881
And since he was the older boy, he was the one who 
made me feel at home. And he was the one who

00:23.901 --> 00:28.367
accompanied me in everything. Naturally, I felt 
very sad. But when he came to

00:35.966 --> 00:49.208
see me, he told me, Mom, I came for the last time. 
this week, but I'm going to go to San Francisco,

00:49.373 --> 00:55.083
California, he said. I'm going to be there, it 
seems to me that one day or two, and I'm going to go to

00:55.103 --> 01:08.226
the other

00:55.103 --> 01:08.226
side, they're going to take me. So, when he was in 
San Francisco, he tells me, Amma, me mandó una

01:14.703 --> 01:21.874
carta por avión y me dice, Amma, ya me voy. Dice, 
quiero que me mandes diez pesos. Dice, porque ya me

01:30.587 --> 01:32.009
voy a ir. Yo no sé cuándo voy a venir, entonces 
estaba la guerra. Bueno, yo siempre he tenido

01:38.519 --> 01:41.604
valor. Le digo, Well, my son, but God is very great 
and soon you will return. I felt sad because I

01:54.073 --> 01:55.855
didn't always feel good. I still would have felt 
good with my husband, I was fine. But he was my

02:02.243 --> 02:06.949
husband and he was my son. Well, he

02:07.030 --> 02:13.718
left, he stayed, he continued. Le mandé el dinero 
pronto porque todo el tiempo el dinero en mí había

02:14.845 --> 02:29.459
muy poco, pero fui una mamá que cuidé mucho, mucho 
cuidé. Entonces, no lo recibió, pero lo recibió

02:29.479 --> 02:38.287
allá cuando estaba allá. Entonces, a la semana me 
habla él y me dice, mamá, aquí, Ya recibí tu carta y

02:44.377 --> 02:47.861
estoy bien. Y mira, aquí estoy con una japonesa 
retratado. Ya me siento más contento porque aquí

02:52.566 --> 02:58.713
son muy amables. Rogándole a Dios que terminara la 
guerra porque estaba duro. Pues no, Diosito, en

03:07.163 --> 03:13.590
todo obra que mis hijos que han ido. Entonces, mi 
hijo yo creo que iba en el barco, o iba llegando, o

03:14.566 --> 03:38.492
estaba allá, cuando dice que todos por donde 
quiera brincaban, gritaban, se abrazaban,

03:14.566 --> 03:38.492
aventaban cojines, aventaban cuento, y gracias a 
Dios que se terminó la guerra. Sí, fíjate. Dice mi

03:41.516 --> 03:42.717
hijo, mamá, We were happy, it was very sad, but at 
the same time, happy because the war is over. It

03:55.087 --> 04:03.979
lasted a year, raising, helping all the 
destructors that the war caused. And as he looked,

04:03.999 --> 04:13.412
as I told you about the chubasco here, Asina says, 
my boy, that he looked, stepping, The blood. Well,

04:15.374 --> 04:20.582
how much, he said they looked. So my boy didn't have 
much school. Poorly, but he always gave my

04:24.308 --> 04:28.635
children school. Because they loved them. This 
boy only studied until five. But this boy had a very

04:35.085 --> 04:40.834
good memory. Este muchacho yo le alistaba su 
lonche, él tenía 17 años, 16 años.

04:51.664 --> 04:53.928
Le alistaba su lonche y se iba.

04:57.754 --> 05:03.784
Y yo hago, digo, muchachos, a los más chicos, no hay 
de estos muchachos en la escuela, dice él. Mom, we

05:05.148 --> 05:09.233
saw him yesterday, he didn't go to school. He got 
scared of the bus. There were no phones, there was

05:13.517 --> 05:16.981
nothing. So, for us, there was nothing. Well, I 
said... This boy, what's his name? Graviel.

05:27.093 --> 05:27.773
Graviel. German. German. Yes, he's the oldest. 
He's the oldest. Yes. Well, then...

05:37.362 --> 05:43.352
He says, my mom, here I need the school he gave me. 
Because this boy learned very well to write

05:45.356 --> 05:53.329
Spanish and to read it in the short time he was in 
school. He learned very well to read English and to

05:54.211 --> 06:02.425
read it, write it. Thank you

06:03.535 --> 06:31.332
very much. Yeah, okay. You're not going to stop by 
the office later? Oh, yeah, I'll run by. Okay. I

06:37.080 --> 06:40.405
don't know exactly who it will be. Okay. Thank you. 
Hello, how are you? Hello. That's my girl. Nice to

06:43.510 --> 06:45.212
meet you. That's the one I have here. That's the one 
I have here in the house, that's the only one. Is it

06:51.622 --> 06:52.824
the smallest? Okay. The youngest? Yes, yes. Huh? 
So he says, Mom, I was lucky. And that's why now I

07:02.294 --> 07:12.007
think the school you gave me is useful. And tell my 
brothers to never leave school, because school is

07:12.107 --> 07:19.637
what you need. But look, he says, here I am in an 
office. He says, I'm receiving everything from

07:23.703 --> 07:27.508
Texas. Here, he says, I am the one who is receiving 
everything that comes from there. And I am with the

07:33.039 --> 07:35.225
pencil. He says, here... I remember what you told 
me. You said that all the time you tried to send us to

07:42.775 --> 07:47.439
school. And we didn't go to school. I didn't go to 
school. Well, now I need to go. But mom, here I am.

07:58.488 --> 08:01.311
God gave me a head. And you know what I studied at 
school. And now I'm here in the office. He only went

08:09.271 --> 08:13.176
to those places by turn. But he was there all the 
time, receiving the goods that came from here,

08:13.636 --> 08:21.826
from the States, there. You see? So, when he came, 
he came, but also my whole family.

08:34.721 --> 08:38.265
They were good boys. I say that my children were 
good because I didn't fight like Nora does. Moms

08:45.132 --> 08:46.233
fight with their youth. My son got addicted when he 
went to work. It's good that the one who wants to be

08:51.259 --> 09:05.436
bad, the one who wants to go, and wants to get 
addicted, gets it, and the one who doesn't,

08:51.259 --> 09:05.436
doesn't. But he, He took the vice there and came to 
Sina, Sina, Sina, and he was very drunk, very

09:07.422 --> 09:24.379
drunk. Well, then, when he came,

09:24.399 --> 09:35.691
he told me, Mom, I think you're going to buy me a 
truck to work. He said, because I don't want to work

09:36.481 --> 09:40.866
in the field. I said, well, no. I said, yes, I'm 
going to raise money for you to buy a truck, because

09:43.069 --> 09:53.402
I know that trucks give money. And we're going to do 
our best to buy you a truck. Well, then my friends

09:56.986 --> 10:01.932
tell me, Oye, Lupe, ¿tú tienes un muchacho en el 
servicio? Le digo sí. Y va a venir en estos días. I

10:12.205 --> 10:18.212
told him, but I don't know, I told him, how will it 
come, I told him. Because when you have your

10:18.913 --> 10:26.422
children in the house, if there is a son or if there 
is a daughter, you know the customs they have with

10:18.913 --> 10:26.422
you. And outside of you, you don't know what 
customs they bring. I told him, I don't know, I told

10:31.188 --> 10:41.180
him, what customs will be the ones he brings, or 
not, I told him. Well, he came. He was very well for a

10:42.530 --> 10:46.800
month. Very happy, very tired. Tired, and he was 
resting at home. And he said, Mom starts to wash.

10:53.316 --> 10:58.969
Because he... Every little bit, he wanted to be in 
the bathroom, changing clothes and everything.

11:03.641 --> 11:07.364
And he said, Mom, I'll help you lift up your whole 
house. And I said, well, that's good. And you start

11:09.806 --> 11:10.667
washing? Yes, so that you wash and I start lifting 
up your whole house. And he would get up and lift up

11:15.271 --> 11:20.135
the whole house. And it was very clean. He would 
start listening to his music. Well, then, every

11:25.440 --> 11:28.223
month he would leave. Every month. at about four in 
the morning, he would come to drink. Because the

11:37.042 --> 11:41.547
sign of each person comes from a very young age. 
When he was young, very young, he would think a lot

11:41.687 --> 11:50.097
about shaking hands and jumping and screaming. 
And I would always remember that. When he arrived,

11:57.286 --> 11:59.849
Yo estaba despierta porque él no parecía. Y yo 
pensé, dije yo, ay, a lo mejor este muchacho trae el

11:59.869 --> 12:06.756
vicio de tomar. Y como venía así, dije, pues quién 
sabe. Yo estaba mortificada y yo no estaba

12:11.620 --> 12:15.584
durmiendo. Él llega como ese del corredor y se 
agarra. Uh, tiró un grito bien fuerte. Ay, dije yo.

12:25.231 --> 12:27.554
Well, this one is good to drink. And since it was the 
time of Piscas, there were a lot of people there,

12:27.634 --> 12:34.864
and well, there were my friends who had asked me. So 
they woke up later. Then they said, ah, it's the

12:38.208 --> 12:41.252
soldier. Well, Lupe told me. So I went out and I 
talked to him. And he said to me, oh mom, well, he

12:49.987 --> 12:55.616
dispenses me. So he goes inside and I lay him down. 
And he's thinking,

13:01.786 --> 13:08.878
he's thinking over there. Everything that was 
happening over there, he was having it as a

13:09.159 --> 13:14.948
recorder. to everything, to what he drank, to 
everything. He was delirious about all of that. At

13:23.943 --> 13:24.786
last he fell asleep.

13:27.803 --> 13:30.386
He passed by, I bought him the truck. And that week, 
a month later, they wanted a man to work in the field

13:31.147 --> 13:39.578
with those skulls, so they were tractors. And he 
was also forced to do that job. So he says, I'm going

13:43.402 --> 13:50.691
to work, mom, this week, because they need a man. 
And he came in to work. Oh, he was very happy

13:53.975 --> 13:55.397
working. Well, then, when there are again, 
whether boys or girls, when there is again a

13:56.862 --> 14:10.417
person, well, those others are happy and 
everything. And then, well, there were girls

14:10.597 --> 14:18.145
there as well, in the field and everything. And 
since he was a soldier, well, the girls were very

14:18.165 --> 14:24.692
happy to look at him and to greet him and all that. A 
little while later, a girl cheated on him. That

14:30.834 --> 14:35.380
year, he got married. I bought him a truck. He went 
to Falfurrias, because they sell a lot of

14:37.142 --> 14:45.633
watermelon there. He went with the truck to the 
watermelon. No, he made a lot of money in the first

14:50.052 --> 14:56.220
few weeks. The boy who followed him, his name was El 
Héroe Urbano. He was the one who followed him. He

15:08.596 --> 15:12.281
left school and went to Falfurrias, to La Sandía. 
He was the little boy who carried the sand, and he

15:13.863 --> 15:18.169
was the one with the truck. Well, I have a little 
place. And then I told him, I'm going to make a house

15:23.233 --> 15:28.580
with that money you make with the truck. I make a 
house, always thinking. Well, nothing. You know,

15:34.388 --> 15:45.302
when it's not the truck, this happens to the truck, 
you have to pay, and then with vice, everything is

15:34.388 --> 15:45.302
lost. No, he got married. He got married and he 
would have been very sad to leave me. And I told him,

15:56.106 --> 15:59.990
son, look, when you left, you left me. He said, yes, 
mom, I did leave you, but it was not because of my

16:00.050 --> 16:05.416
will. He said, it was because they took me. And now 
it's not my will. I want to be here with you. He says,

16:12.563 --> 16:14.585
I don't want to leave. Well. After we got married, 
he stayed there for a year. He and his wife, we all

16:24.137 --> 16:32.126
went to the police station, to work, and he took the 
truck. And because I was encouraging them, I was

16:33.748 --> 16:39.235
going to work like them. I was going to work like my 
family, me and all my children, as always. So we

16:48.245 --> 17:05.665
went to the year, and he was with me,

16:48.245 --> 17:05.665
and they already had a daughter, who is the eldest 
of them. Her name is Hilda, German for her father.

17:14.115 --> 17:16.378
She is his first daughter. He said, I told him, the 
other boy who was following, and the one who was

17:18.350 --> 17:34.787
following him, he stayed because he couldn't 
follow me because he wanted to finish his school.

17:35.668 --> 17:38.831
And he stayed in his house alone. He had chickens, 
he had pigs, and he stayed to take care of them. And I

17:44.797 --> 17:47.800
went to do something for my family. So, the boy who

17:49.484 --> 18:02.768
was being followed, the second one, he didn't have 
a diarrhea license, but he he took the truck as he

18:03.575 --> 18:21.705
wanted, and a friend of mine and his wife, they were 
very close friends, and they said that they were

18:03.575 --> 18:21.705
going with us, and he had the license to carry that 
friend, and he said, I'm going with you, and I'll

18:03.575 --> 18:21.705
carry your truck, and I'll help him, he said. Well, 
I said, well, then we'll go. And we went, and it

18:25.751 --> 18:29.818
wasn't long before that truck He hit my boy. When he 
entered Robes Town, there were about two of us in

18:33.023 --> 18:40.894
the ranch where we lived. And my boy had to go in like 
this and the right way. Then another one came and

18:46.663 --> 18:52.931
hit him from under the truck. He came and my boy 
stopped here. This one didn't stop and he came and

18:56.457 --> 19:01.003
hit him from under the truck. And my two youngest 
boys were going. The work of God was that the truck

19:03.388 --> 19:11.498
was heavy and it was jammed because it was where it 
was going to go around. He was waiting. So he beat

19:13.661 --> 19:18.086
him. He beat him a little. We went to Sina. We left 
and with that family, well, then we were in

19:25.553 --> 19:35.113
Glumento. There I had some good patrons. By the 
way, my little baby boy, they loved him very much.

19:44.498 --> 19:54.071
And they took a mube from us, where my little boy, 
the rib that was put here, was left here. And they

19:54.091 --> 19:57.856
loved the bosses very much. And that's where we 
were. Then we made him cotton and we carried him and

20:00.519 --> 20:03.984
everything. With the truck, my medium boy carried 
the cotton. Well, we didn't want this truck

20:09.158 --> 20:13.244
anymore because it was sold out. So there was a 
truck there, Chivet.

20:19.973 --> 20:23.258
And I was with my brother, he was also a trucker.

20:25.842 --> 20:33.613
So we had already made money, and those bosses were 
owners of that agency. So my brother told them, he

20:34.083 --> 20:47.116
said, we can't give you anything for the truck, but 
we can give you a part of the money and you can take

20:34.083 --> 20:47.116
the truck for your sister. So a boy said, it was 
good. And I told him, but we're not going to leave

20:50.059 --> 20:54.384
here, we're not going to leave here. I told him, I 
don't want to live without money. So he says, well,

20:59.970 --> 21:03.313
no, he says, with that we have to get there. We took 
out the truck, and we left the truck there, but the

21:04.272 --> 21:10.519
truck had already given us money. And I, with all my 
family, there were eight, there were seven. And

21:18.549 --> 21:21.092
the other brother tells me, are you going to leave? 
I said, yes. And why are you going to leave if there

21:22.133 --> 21:27.459
are more people who eat than who work? I said, yes, 
but here I have another worker, who is the truck. I

21:32.024 --> 21:33.486
told him, my boy, and me. Well, mom is already 
tired. She's going to drink water and then drink

21:39.615 --> 21:48.171
something. I'm tired of what? Well, to be sitting. 
So we arrived and we took out the truck and we fixed

21:50.776 --> 21:55.626
it. And so we went to Oklahoma. We arrived in 
Oklahoma. This little girl who told you, the lady,

22:06.035 --> 22:15.166
she was about 12 years old. They were all 
schoolboys. But when there were opportunities,

22:18.209 --> 22:22.795
they would go to school even if they didn't help me. 
So we went, we left there a little house that they

22:24.985 --> 22:41.188
gave us everything and they said that we were going 
to the border guard because everything was closed

22:24.985 --> 22:41.188
here and that we were going to the border guard 
because we were going to meet there and bring food.

22:41.208 --> 22:46.555
So I didn't want to go very well because it was the 
border guard. And he tells me, the other gentleman

22:47.396 --> 22:52.984
had his papers and we all had our papers, but he had 
his license. I said, he doesn't say anything about

22:53.386 --> 22:55.670
going to the other side. He says, no, he doesn't say 
anything. He says, we can go. Well, let's go. So we

23:03.161 --> 23:05.224
went. Everything was very unknown. On the other 
side it was very unknown. It was in the guardrail.

23:11.915 --> 23:14.078
And I... We went in and there was a little shop with a 
lot of air and a lot of heat. And then they started

23:22.229 --> 23:25.722
saying, where are you from? We asked them where 
they were from. They said they had just arrived. I

23:31.627 --> 23:33.050
said, yes, we have just arrived. He said, don't you 
know what time it is? I said, yes, I can hear you. I

23:38.499 --> 23:39.221
said, what time? He said, well, if they bring boys 
from school, they won't even go to work. And they

23:43.949 --> 23:50.781
won't even give them a job, because right now it's 
very hard here for the boys from school and

23:43.949 --> 23:50.781
everything. Well, I started to get nervous all of a 
sudden. So we looked for the orders and

23:58.987 --> 24:04.737
everything. So I said, I, as I receive the 
surprise, I solve it later. So I told them, yes, I

24:09.357 --> 24:16.325
told them, but since there is a school, I put my boys 
in the school. I told them, I don't take care of

24:16.405 --> 24:18.528
them. Ah, well, then we came. No, there we were, and 
it was very cold already in those times, very cold,

24:24.094 --> 24:32.404
a lot of air, a lot of rain, a lot of ice. So I took... 
to my little boy, who is the oldest, the youngest of

24:37.538 --> 24:47.328
all the oldest, of the four oldest. Well, then, The 
truck was carrying the cotton, and they were just

24:52.405 --> 24:59.037
trying to pinch it. We had a few pinchers, and they 
were trying to pinch it, and I didn't need them to

24:59.057 --> 25:07.832
help me, not even with the cold and all that. Then 
the boss said, no, you know what, you can send them

25:07.812 --> 25:11.696
to school. The boss said, you can send them to 
school and you can work. No, I don't have much. He

25:18.763 --> 25:23.889
said, but it will only be a month, what there will 
be, just a month. I said, well, with that month I had

25:23.929 --> 25:27.612
100 pesos. I said, well, another month is good. We 
went to work another day. No. Well, I always

25:36.297 --> 25:54.339
struggled because the cold, sometimes people 
couldn't step on it, but I would throw myself to

25:36.297 --> 25:54.339
walk, sometimes holding the cold, because 
sometimes it was cold, I could fall. And well,

25:54.379 --> 25:58.063
everyone, and the oldest boy of mine said, mom, 
it's very cold. I said, yes, it's very cold, go. If

26:00.513 --> 26:05.380
you have a lot of cold, go to the truck, while the 
cold calms down, and make a fire. And people made a

26:05.400 --> 26:07.142
fire there. And they were, I with the exercise and 
everything, because I think that rather with the

26:07.163 --> 26:17.577
mortifications, there are times when you don't 
feel anything. I, I said, I don't feel the cold, and

26:18.579 --> 26:27.752
I hurried a lot, a lot, because they were just 
grabbing like that, everything like that, even. I

26:28.272 --> 26:38.603
would go out and when he came back, I would weigh 
myself and I would get rid of the cold. Yes, I would

26:38.623 --> 26:41.906
weigh myself two or three times. My brother or 
others would say, hey, let's go. But it was already

26:45.830 --> 26:47.572
three o'clock. Let's go, let's go. And we would go. 
When we got there, our clothes were like that and we

26:49.674 --> 26:54.119
would leave them in the bucket. We were right, we 
were right, we were cold. Look, look how it's

26:56.441 --> 26:58.043
getting cold. Oh, well, then... Well, I had that 
commitment to that truck until I got home. We

27:09.288 --> 27:18.437
brought both trucks, because they didn't want the 
other one. So, that year, I left. So, my boy still

27:22.221 --> 27:25.805
didn't leave me. He told me that He said, I had 
cousins in Washington. Washington State.

27:33.575 --> 27:35.120
Washington State. So they would tell me to leave 
all the time. And this boy, who had an accident,

27:40.109 --> 27:45.855
told me, Mom, let's go. Let's go to where my cousins 
are. I said, no, I don't want to go with you. And I

27:52.142 --> 27:58.770
said, no, it's better to be here, fighting. Well, 
that year, my boy told me, I told him, the strongest

27:58.830 --> 28:05.037
ice came here. Very strong ice. All the ice broke. 
So he said to me, I said, you know what? He said, now I

28:18.074 --> 28:21.300
can go to Washington, mom. I said, yes, now I'm 
going to go. He said, well, mom, I felt very

28:25.007 --> 28:30.737
mortified because my son did go to the service. He 
finished his school. He had one month, I think, or

28:32.745 --> 28:38.294
three months left for him to finish his school. The 
teachers went and everything, raising

28:38.574 --> 28:53.197
signatures, he with the boss, the boss of us, and 
they left him so that the government would leave

28:38.574 --> 28:53.197
him so that he could finish his school in three 
months. So, already in that year, which I think I

28:53.317 --> 28:58.665
think it was the El cincuenta y cinco, o el cuarenta 
y cuatro, no, cuarenta y seis, yo creo. Entonces me

29:11.365 --> 29:16.050
dice, mamá, yo ya me voy a ir. Dice, ahora sí, ¿qué va 
a hacer usted? Porque yo voy a vender a usted

29:20.935 --> 29:26.520
marranos, vender gallinas, porque él era el que me 
los cuidaba. Él era... woman and man, and it was

29:29.425 --> 29:33.876
dad. So I told him, well, go sell everything. And 
they were in a hurry, carrying chickens, pigs,

29:38.046 --> 29:42.578
everything to sell. They sold everything. He was 
about to leave the service. He said, what about

29:46.992 --> 29:48.334
you? I said, I'm going to Washington because I'm 
bringing the truck's commitment. And three days

29:53.862 --> 29:58.148
later, the cold ended everything in Los Files. I 
told him, I'm going to have to leave. And I thought

30:01.653 --> 30:06.921
that my son was going to be close to me. And I was 
thinking that he was going to be close. And I was

30:09.625 --> 30:13.671
going to go there because I was close. So he just 
left. Arreglamos todos nosotros. Yo tenía un

30:17.070 --> 30:22.035
muchacho que se vino para California, el más chico 
de los grandes. Entonces, ese día recibí una carta

30:23.857 --> 30:27.721
de él. Entonces le dije a mi muchacho, vámonos. 
Escribe luego, luego una carta y mándasela y dile

30:33.547 --> 30:41.134
que en Washington nos vemos.

30:41.154 --> 30:44.117
Nos fuimos, luego lo arreglamos todo. We went out 
to Washington. I had my youngest baby, the

30:48.444 --> 30:57.714
youngest of the family, of the men. So, because the 
baby sometimes followed her. So, they went very

31:06.364 --> 31:08.046
often.

31:10.743 --> 31:13.246
Well, we arrived in Washington. There, I worked 
day after day for three months. With that

31:19.794 --> 31:22.918
asparagus, you cut it like this. For three months, 
you have to work. For four in the morning, you have

31:25.221 --> 31:29.787
to go to work. Because that one is cut very early. 
With a stick. It's a carton like cabbage, but you

31:35.144 --> 31:40.297
put it in drawers. Here is the line of drawers, 
another line of drawers, and here you cut it and you

31:40.317 --> 31:48.057
put it in, and they pay for it in pounds. And there 
were times that what we cut, we would get up to 30

31:49.117 --> 31:56.769
pesos per day, each person. 30, me, 30, my boy, 
because only the two of us worked. Because

32:02.537 --> 32:06.243
everyone went to school, the middle school kids, 
yes, everyone to school. Well, then, this year, I

32:08.046 --> 32:17.520
came, I came back. Entonces yo salvé mi troque, yo 
gané muy buen dinero, y entonces mi muchacho

32:17.905 --> 32:37.390
todavía andaba conmigo, pero ya entonces ya 
estaba casado, ya tenía dos años de casado, pero él

32:17.905 --> 32:37.390
ya estaba aparte. Pero siempre nosotros lo 
llevamos. Al año nomás acabamos todo el trabajo de

32:42.880 --> 32:47.525
Washington. Nos vinimos al West, y ahí estuvimos 
trabajando. Luego de ahí, nos vinimos aquí a

32:54.832 --> 33:04.902
este...

32:54.832 --> 33:04.902
Bicho, ¿cómo se llama? Sí. No, no en Bicho, no. Este 
pueblito que está aquí de Robistown. No, no,

33:10.408 --> 33:11.689
Viver, no. ¿Cómo se llama este pueblito chiquito? 
Ahí está de aquel lado de Robestán, ahorita no

33:16.732 --> 33:18.980
recuerdo. Bueno, ahí estuvimos. Mi muchacho 
vino. the one who was in the army, I wasn't here, I

33:27.211 --> 33:37.243
was in Washington, and he came here, but he had 
already left his girlfriend here. He was going to

33:37.303 --> 33:39.966
get married. When he left the service, at the age of 
two, he got married. Well, when I came that year, my

33:45.252 --> 33:55.805
boyfriend, I was here, and at the age of two, he was 
here. So, Él, como ella tenía su novia, ese año yo no

33:58.379 --> 34:06.147
estaba aquí, pero lo recibieron los papás de esa 
muchacha.

34:11.333 --> 34:14.176
Y dicen sus papás es mucho lo que hicieron a mi 
muchacho.

34:16.758 --> 34:24.286
Y entonces a los dos años él se casó con su muchacho. 
Bueno, le tocó muy buena suerte él.

34:29.108 --> 34:43.415
Yo a los dos años yo compré entonces ya esa troca, 
los muchachos sacaron otra troca del año que fue el

34:29.108 --> 34:43.415
muchacho que tengo ahorita en California. Este 
muchacho Yo quedé mala. Cuando yo vine el segundo

34:49.140 --> 34:55.131
año, yo quedé mala y me dijo el doctor, ¿para qué te 
vas? Si tú vas a estar mala. Y si tú te atrasas en el

34:57.315 --> 35:01.903
camino, tú te van a poner que tener en un hospital. 
Dice, o regresar para atrás. Dice, y tú no

35:04.387 --> 35:06.591
necesitas irte. And I was very mortified because I 
was the one who was directing my boy. I was the one

35:13.201 --> 35:15.464
responsible for everything. Because I couldn't 
trust him because he was a boy. I said, but at the

35:21.634 --> 35:24.017
same time I can't leave either. So I stayed and my 
boy tells me, this one who is the second one. But

35:31.008 --> 35:33.692
with permission, you are a nurse. And he said, you 
can,

35:35.495 --> 35:49.183
you can, brother, you can go wherever you want.

35:54.125 --> 35:55.807
Ah, my boy says, stay. He says, I'll take you, mom. 
He says, because you're bad. He says, and if you get

36:00.253 --> 36:03.677
better, I'll take you. Let him go there alone. He 
says, oh, I'm mortifying myself. I said, because I

36:09.724 --> 36:11.166
don't want to stay. I said, because I don't want to 
lose anything. But there are times that one... I

36:20.872 --> 36:29.164
never trusted my children to run my business. No, 
they were already big, but they counted on me.

36:32.949 --> 36:37.175
Because I never wanted my children to put me out. I 
said, if I get careless, my children take

36:37.916 --> 36:45.086
everything out and put me out. I said, no, 
everything they want to do, I want to know. Well, I

36:51.297 --> 36:54.083
don't know about that. Okay, I'm going to stay. And 
you're going to do this and this, and you're going

36:54.824 --> 36:58.812
to do it. No. Well. And I just based myself on the 
fact that my boy was going to to do what we, my second

37:09.522 --> 37:20.719
son, explained to him what he was going to do and 
what responsibility he was going to take. And so

37:20.800 --> 37:22.903
did I, but he didn't do it. He did it on one side, he 
believed in his friends, and he did it on the other

37:22.923 --> 37:29.774
side. There was another boy in Washington, 
married, but he was the youngest of all. So, Yo le

37:37.754 --> 37:49.373
dije a mi hermano, yo, que es este hermano que tengo 
aquí, que es el mayor mío, le dije yo, me voy contigo

37:37.754 --> 37:49.373
pa'l juez. Y yo tenía estos muchachitos, todos 
medianos, pero la muchachita más grande esa tenía

37:50.675 --> 37:58.227
como 12 años. I said, I'm going to go with you. He 
said, and why are you going to go? He said, if very

38:03.669 --> 38:10.278
few are the ones who pinch and you with so many 
children. I said, well, as I want I have to do

38:10.298 --> 38:12.061
something. I said, because here I can't do 
anything alone here. I said, and it's better to go

38:14.965 --> 38:17.068
with you. I start pinching and I know how I'm going 
to work. Well, these little boys, my baby, I think

38:22.287 --> 38:28.454
he was about two months old, he was a baby. And this 
other one, a little girl. Well, I went with my

38:33.839 --> 38:35.701
brother. My brother had a pickup truck, he had a big 
truck. He carried people. And a sister-in-law of

38:42.869 --> 38:48.615
mine had given me a baby bed with all the fabric, 
pure fabric. Well, what I thought was that then we

38:49.692 --> 39:05.322
were going to go fishing, and we would throw that 
child into the truck, and there I would put my baby,

38:49.692 --> 39:05.322
and the biggest one, or the one that would fly like 
that, there they would put the bed in the shade and

39:05.302 --> 39:29.298
every time they went out I would take care of them or 
the one who would go out would take care of them or my

39:05.302 --> 39:29.298
little girl, who is the oldest, would look after 
them and since they were very good, just being

39:05.302 --> 39:29.298
clean and everything they didn't bother, they 
would play, they would eat and everything. Well,

39:29.318 --> 39:32.423
because then, look, I Me apuraba mucho y mis niños 
eran muy buenos pa' trabajar. Miraban aquellas

39:38.749 --> 39:45.041
matas de algodón, mira, de este tamaño, tan 
grandes, llenas, mira, de algodón. En veces me

39:46.624 --> 39:52.314
decía mi hermano, ¿quieres ir pa' Glumento al show 
o algo? No. ¿Te vas a quedar? Dice así. Me quedaba

39:55.724 --> 40:01.650
con los dos niños, que ellos no querían ir o no los 
mandaba. Y si iban mis otros dos muchachitos,

40:01.670 --> 40:06.314
porque pues ellos se cansaban al fin, no querían 
ir. Ellos iban con ellos. Y yo me quedaba. ¿Qué

40:09.097 --> 40:10.598
crees que hacía todo ese día? Yo piscaba todo el 
día, piscaba. Llenaba los costales todos de

40:15.423 --> 40:17.805
algodón. Y como estaba cerquita de la casa, 
llenaba aquellos costales llenos de algodón, lo

40:17.825 --> 40:24.972
que yo podía. Pagaban a dos cincuenta, me parece, 
la cien allá. Huaxina nomás, con todo y castillo.

40:33.100 --> 40:35.282
¿Tú entiendes todo lo que te estoy diciendo? Sí, 
chico, bueno. Entonces,

40:37.204 --> 40:51.938
cuando mis muchachitos no iban, que era la 
muchachita grande, y una hija que tengo en

40:37.204 --> 40:51.938
Filadelfia, tengo una hija, y este... Rudy, who is 
the husband of this one who was here, Virginia.

40:58.198 --> 40:58.278
Yes. Well, that's my son. Yes. He also stayed. And 
yes, the three of us were going, all the others, but

41:05.326 --> 41:13.094
the three who helped me were them. They loved life 
and work and work just like me. ¿Qué crees que otro

41:16.657 --> 41:21.803
día aquí iba mi hermano a pesar algodón? Pesaban 
los 500, 400

41:22.344 --> 41:29.313
libras de algodón. Todo eso piscaron ustedes, sí. 
Porque a mis muchachitos siempre les gustó

41:32.897 --> 41:39.525
trabajar igual a mí, porque yo, Like my father, my 
father taught me how to work and how to do a clean job

41:40.805 --> 41:47.471
in the field. That's how I taught myself, because 
it was all that my father left me. And your husband

41:51.715 --> 41:54.397
too? No. No? I struggled. Doesn't your husband 
like to work? No, my life is a story. Yes, it is. My

42:05.146 --> 42:09.310
life is very... Well, tell me about your husband. 
Bueno, ahorita, amiga. Entonces, mi...

42:12.358 --> 42:20.427
Todo eso, decía mi hermano, todo eso hiciste tú. 
Sí. Oye, no creo yo, le digo, pues todo el día

42:23.670 --> 42:28.936
trabajamos. Fíjate nomás. Cuando yo me quedaba, 
yo llegué a hacer hasta 500 libras en un día de

42:30.378 --> 42:38.807
piscar algodón. A lot of cotton. Every day 300, 400 
pounds of cotton. I did it every day. I did it alone.

42:48.262 --> 42:50.724
You did it alone? I did it alone. Why don't you bring 
her a soda

42:55.429 --> 43:01.976
and something? Yes. So... You're going to... It 
was a lot of what we would step on. They would say, I

43:13.404 --> 43:16.148
would empty it. There in that ranch of José Yáliva, 
I would step on a lot of cotton. And I would beat my

43:21.636 --> 43:27.906
little brother, older than me, because he was very 
thin and all, to carry the pounds. My little

43:28.426 --> 43:31.491
brother couldn't. And I would lift them up and say 
to my father, I'm going to put the gold teeth on

43:31.511 --> 43:38.241
Lupe. Porque Lupe, buena trabajadora que es, 
decía él. Bueno, por eso es de que yo I got married

43:49.173 --> 44:03.828
and continued working very hard, both at home and 
in the field, because that's how I forced myself to

43:49.173 --> 44:03.828
work a lot at home, since I was very little. I worked 
and worked, and I continued working, and until

44:03.848 --> 44:10.255
now, it's rarely the day that I get tired. It's 
rarely the day that I go to bed early because I'm

44:10.275 --> 44:16.041
tired, because something hurts. So I

44:17.978 --> 44:28.080
went

44:17.978 --> 44:28.080
to... I worked a lot that year, I think it was in 
1955.

44:40.709 --> 44:46.017
So I say to my boy, who is in Washington, come for me. 
Because I want to go back. Because this boy didn't

44:48.981 --> 44:51.264
go back. The one who saw him took the truck. He 
stayed there.

44:58.735 --> 44:59.516
He stayed there. So, do you bring me coffee, Jane? 
Yes. So he said to me, Mamá, ¿sabe qué? Dijo, que el

45:09.779 --> 45:12.582
troqui aquí está en Idaho. Dijo, y este muchacho se 
llama Avaristo, el que está en California.

45:20.131 --> 45:23.234
Entonces, dice, él se fue, mamá, y aquí dejó el 
troqui. Le dije, ¿sabes qué? Quiero que agarres el

45:25.997 --> 45:30.503
troqui y te vengas pronto por mí, le dije. Vente.
