WEBVTT

00:02.967 --> 00:11.597
Grades were in a building and then I think the third and fourth were in one, maybe first and second.

00:12.458 --> 00:24.392
That school incidentally, there's a drawing of it in the artwork that was given to President Bush.

00:25.193 --> 00:32.502
There's one of the little scenes on that shows that school looking north toward the campus.

00:32.870 --> 00:37.215
just as I remember it, I'd like to know where she got that.

00:37.456 --> 00:39.018
Yeah, yeah.

00:39.238 --> 00:43.563
Right, no, wait, what's her name, the lady that painted that thing?

00:43.924 --> 00:45.826
I don't know.

00:46.907 --> 00:48.690
Well, I've got a copy of it upstairs.

00:49.591 --> 00:50.432
My husband's a lawyer.

00:51.052 --> 00:57.941
But anyhow, one of the little scenes is of that school looking north, and you can see the system building in the background.

00:59.503 --> 00:59.603
Yeah.

01:00.848 --> 01:09.980
Who were some of the special teachers in your junior and senior high school years?

01:10.000 --> 01:15.468
Grady Elms was a seventh grade teacher.

01:15.528 --> 01:21.315
We're talking 1940 here.

01:21.375 --> 01:26.522
The ladies, there was a Mrs. Slaughter of all names.

01:26.562 --> 01:30.788
Her husband was a physician, inappropriately named.

01:31.190 --> 01:33.012
Mrs. Heaton was there.

01:33.072 --> 01:47.151
In high school, the superintendent was Mance Park, I think that's singular, who died just recently.

01:47.251 --> 01:56.623
He was over in Huntsville and had a remarkable career in the educational world and was recognized.

01:57.464 --> 01:58.986
Mr. Bunning, W.D.

01:59.046 --> 02:11.366
Bunning came along about that time and assumed the superintendency, the others all went into service as soon as the 1941, most of the male teachers left.

02:12.307 --> 02:18.096
Mr. Bunning I guess was old enough that when he had a family he was not drafted.

02:18.156 --> 02:22.904
He incidentally died just the last two or three months at age 94 or so.

02:23.004 --> 02:25.648
There was a

02:25.628 --> 02:34.041
Coach came, Lyles, who taught, what did Mr. Lyles teach?

02:35.704 --> 02:40.251
He was primarily the coach, though, who didn't anything but football or wasn't anything else.

02:40.632 --> 02:43.676
A little track in the spring, a little bit of track in the spring.

02:46.741 --> 02:53.712
The teachers then, one of the teachers was Mrs. Carl Landis, of course, who's still here.

02:54.518 --> 03:15.201
There was Ferguson, Tommy Ferguson, and his wife, I think she's still living, the Fergusons, Mrs. Landis, Mrs. Fleming, Delia Fleming was there.

03:15.262 --> 03:16.923
She was one of our favorites.

03:17.784 --> 03:24.492
Oh, and then there was an English teacher, Mrs. Thompson, whose husband was an architect and I think

03:25.298 --> 03:40.297
did most of the designing of the school system over here under the, I think under, Ernest Langford had his hand in nearly all the architectural things that went on around here, Ernest Langford, and he was involved.

03:41.018 --> 03:53.213
Who were the, during those late 30s and early 40s, who were the college station community leaders, I'm talking about off campus community leaders?

03:53.497 --> 04:06.537
Herschel Burgess I think now of course developed what we know as Oakwood over here and of course his wife was Dr. Walton's daughter, the president's daughter.

04:10.624 --> 04:11.505
Colonel Andy

04:11.806 --> 04:15.611
I think you said you were going to interview Rusty Anderson tomorrow.

04:15.691 --> 04:25.964
His father certainly was, he was a commandant and a coach and lots of, a mayor, who was the mayor of College Station.

04:25.984 --> 04:27.707
Yes sir, he was one of the mayors.

04:30.690 --> 04:35.797
Let's see, Sid Loveless came along about that time.

04:35.957 --> 04:40.463
In fact, he was the first city secretary.

04:42.029 --> 04:43.071
Bennett, J.H.

04:43.191 --> 04:54.207
Bennett was, I think, was the first mayor who was killed in an automobile accident, oh, 41, 40, somewhere along in there.

04:57.872 --> 05:04.001
Let's see, of course, the people on campus were, G.O.

05:04.021 --> 05:07.767
Walton was president, Lipscomb,

05:08.219 --> 05:16.604
ran Lipscomb's pharmacy, was a pharmacist, Bill Sparks, Sparks, Lipscomb, J.F.

05:16.684 --> 05:21.418
Casey, a man who never married, but Sparks and Casey,

05:22.124 --> 05:28.556
owned one of the drug stores at the North Gate and of course there was Casey's confectionary in the YMCA.

05:29.117 --> 05:29.738
Was that same?

05:30.239 --> 05:31.361
Same, yeah, J.F.

05:31.381 --> 05:33.886
Casey, uh-huh.

05:34.246 --> 05:38.614
Cashin, I think, would be termed a leader in the community.

05:38.654 --> 05:41.820
Of course Dr. Clark was head of the economics department.

05:42.998 --> 05:55.317
He got crossways with Mr. Gilchrist in 47 and was fired, but then he continued the development of, you know, way south with Bill Fitch.

05:55.577 --> 06:00.024
He and Bill Fitch were instrumental in all of that.

06:00.044 --> 06:07.656
Now, I heard just a teeny bit from Mr. Gilchrist about the incorporation of the town of College Station.

06:08.345 --> 06:15.113
And I got the impression that it was done to prevent Brian's annexing it.

06:15.133 --> 06:15.974
Did you hear any?

06:15.994 --> 06:17.376
Oh, yes, very definitely.

06:18.557 --> 06:26.606
Yes, and in fact, Brian would have annexed more, but they got up to their limit.

06:26.646 --> 06:31.392
There's a certain amount that you can annex per year or some period of time.

06:31.452 --> 06:34.356
And so, yes, very definitely.

06:34.436 --> 06:38.200
That was one of the reasons, and this is pretty well documented in the

06:39.547 --> 07:05.250
the book uh who the lady that uh below well you've seen copies of the book that the was written in conjunction with the 1988 uh our 50-year celebration very good documentation of a lot of these things she did an excellent job of documenting but yes it was to get incorporated well we needed to i mean

07:06.040 --> 07:16.695
We had no police, you know, no fire, no nothing, and, you know, we were totally dependent on A&M for fire, and even A&M didn't have any police force.

07:16.835 --> 07:22.023
It was, you know, we chased the parking people around.

07:22.043 --> 07:30.715
Let's say up through the end of World War II, where could a person in College Station have bought groceries without going to Bryan, wasn't it?

07:30.695 --> 07:33.519
Oh, yeah, we had a couple of good grocery stores.

07:33.579 --> 07:37.204
Luke Patronella ran a grocery store.

07:37.224 --> 07:46.077
In fact, he and Charles Apperstini were in grocery business together in the early 30s, Luke and Charlie's.

07:47.238 --> 07:56.211
And quoting the books of the Bible, we grew up, it wasn't Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, it was Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Charlie.

07:56.231 --> 07:56.331
So...

07:56.311 --> 08:04.462
So, but in mid-30s, they separated and Luke opened his own store.

08:04.482 --> 08:10.750
Now, Luke Patronella is the father to Joyce Birdwell, you may well know.

08:10.770 --> 08:15.957
In fact, she just died recently in the last week, Mrs. Patronella did, just died.

08:16.645 --> 08:23.761
And then that was at a place at the north gate and so help me, I have no earthly idea how they squeezed that place.

08:23.781 --> 08:28.492
You drive through that area now and you can't even imagine a grocery store being there.

08:28.512 --> 08:30.958
But he had a grocery store, we thought a good one.

08:31.968 --> 08:39.477
and then later moved to the East Gate, to that row of businesses right at the entrance over there, and there are pictures of it.

08:39.977 --> 08:45.343
And then about, oh, in 40 or 41, Southside was developed.

08:45.864 --> 08:55.094
Sparks and old Dan Russell and somebody else built that building that housed Mailey Pharmacy, Southside Food Market.

08:55.114 --> 08:58.778
So there was nothing at Southside, no commercial until then?

08:59.039 --> 09:00.220
That's right.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.146
There was a doctor's office.

09:02.186 --> 09:04.132
Dwight Andre was over there.

09:04.152 --> 09:06.799
I was his first patient, by the way.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.725
I set myself on fire.

09:09.312 --> 09:20.785
in July of 1940, and my mother was getting ready to take me to Bryan, and she said, I think there's a new doctor, let's chance it.

09:20.825 --> 09:26.090
Sure enough, he was still unwrapping his furniture and stuff upstairs.

09:26.110 --> 09:30.455
I was Dwight Andre's first patient above Medley's pharmacy.

09:31.456 --> 09:33.879
Of course, Mr. Medley just died, you know.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.822
I wasn't aware of his

09:36.802 --> 09:39.668
being alive or I would have tried to have interviewed him.

09:39.728 --> 09:40.669
He would have been great.

09:40.689 --> 09:41.210
Some months ago.

09:42.573 --> 09:42.753
Yeah.

09:43.094 --> 09:46.921
And Madeleaves became a community gathering place, didn't it?

09:46.941 --> 09:47.763
Oh, definitely.

09:47.843 --> 09:48.785
Yes, yes.

09:48.805 --> 09:50.388
Go get coffee and a soft drink.

09:50.629 --> 09:51.350
That's right.

09:51.410 --> 09:53.494
As a matter of fact, the

09:53.879 --> 09:59.185
college people would get in college vehicles and drive down to Madeleine.

09:59.765 --> 10:08.355
And I can remember there was this caused some problems of people first leaving work and driving university vehicles and all sorts of things.

10:08.375 --> 10:14.281
So you can imagine the rules and regulations that came out about preventing that sort of activity.

10:15.082 --> 10:19.347
But I don't think it probably deterred it temporarily for a while.

10:19.681 --> 10:21.828
It was definitely the gathering place.

10:22.029 --> 10:28.450
How he made a living off selling 10-cent cups of coffee, I'm not sure, but apparently he did quite well.

10:28.491 --> 10:31.902
He just gave a couple of million dollars to the community.

10:32.287 --> 10:38.433
Where did, in high school, where did you and your buddies go on a Friday night or a Saturday night for fun?

10:39.614 --> 10:41.416
Movies, mostly.

10:42.437 --> 10:44.158
We had the campus theater.

10:44.178 --> 10:48.983
Of course in Bryan, they had three theaters in Bryan.

10:49.003 --> 10:55.209
The Palace, the Queen Theater, and there was a third one that we didn't venture to.

10:55.229 --> 10:56.871
I can't even remember the name of it now.

10:57.091 --> 10:57.952
Was it the gym?

10:58.092 --> 10:58.772
The Dixie.

10:58.893 --> 11:00.454
The Dixie Theater, yes.

11:00.907 --> 11:05.051
And that, I'm not, we didn't go there.

11:05.071 --> 11:06.893
It was below our dignity.

11:07.234 --> 11:10.858
But the palace and the Queen Theater were nice places.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.942
Gatherings at people's houses.

11:16.323 --> 11:21.409
Manning Smith, Manning and Nita Smith began their career in this house.

11:22.270 --> 11:29.277
They were, you know, became world known square dancers, you know, and taught and whatnot.

11:29.813 --> 11:40.267
He was a coach at A&M and right after they were married, I don't know who instigated it, but this house was built with linoleum flooring.

11:41.669 --> 11:47.497
And it moved the furniture back and it made a nice dancing area.

11:47.517 --> 11:52.564
So there were many dances held in this house here.

11:53.287 --> 11:57.331
and they started their dancing career here.

11:58.212 --> 12:03.317
But Holmes provided quite a bit of parting, more so than now.

12:03.557 --> 12:09.143
Did you and your buddies in high school go to the, was it called the gravel pitch, rock pitch?

12:09.163 --> 12:09.643
Yes, sir.

12:10.144 --> 12:10.764
Where were they?

12:12.446 --> 12:13.527
West of Welburn.

12:14.568 --> 12:18.332
You go down to, past Welburn, south of Welburn.

12:18.683 --> 12:20.986
and across the tracks with gravel pits.

12:21.006 --> 12:23.329
About how far west of the tracks?

12:25.351 --> 12:25.892
A mile.

12:27.133 --> 12:28.455
Probably not a mile.

12:29.156 --> 12:30.717
A dirt road, you know.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.220
And so the only water in there was rainwater.

12:33.240 --> 12:34.562
There wasn't a stream.

12:34.582 --> 12:35.703
No.

12:36.084 --> 12:37.546
There wasn't a spring.

12:38.607 --> 12:39.728
There must have been.

12:39.768 --> 12:41.110
The water was not.

12:41.150 --> 12:47.037
You'd envision these circumstances very bad water, but the water was not.

12:47.658 --> 12:56.531
It must have been a spring or something, and maybe the filtering of the gravel cleansed it or something.

12:56.551 --> 13:03.001
Now, was it okay for you high school kids to go when there were any A&M kids there?

13:03.902 --> 13:04.703
Was that all right?

13:05.364 --> 13:07.087
I don't remember any conflicts.

13:08.969 --> 13:10.692
Now, did girls ever go?

13:10.712 --> 13:11.433
Oh, yes.

13:11.814 --> 13:12.535
Yes, indeed.

13:12.675 --> 13:16.821
And you dressed in the car or went over behind the car or something?

13:17.645 --> 13:25.535
I guess, or either went there dressed, probably had her swimming suits on under, you know, outer clothes.

13:26.075 --> 13:27.817
I don't remember that being a problem.

13:28.138 --> 13:30.240
Was that also a place to sleep and drink beer?

13:31.702 --> 13:33.745
Yes, we didn't.

13:33.865 --> 13:36.268
I mean, I wasn't in a beer drinking group.

13:37.910 --> 13:39.452
Not that we were all that pure.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.374
We hadn't been introduced to it.

13:41.945 --> 13:42.786
I guess.

13:42.806 --> 13:44.188
Oh, I'm sure, yes.

13:44.549 --> 13:47.353
Now, we'd go out to the Brazos River a lot, too.

13:49.195 --> 13:51.579
Brazos River was a pretty dangerous place.

13:51.719 --> 13:53.261
There were drownings out there.

13:53.281 --> 14:02.073
But we had, well, I built a boat that we'd go down the Brazos thing, you know, kayak type thing.

14:02.093 --> 14:06.079
But you and your friends didn't usually go out there to the river to swim.

14:07.662 --> 14:15.112
No, the river, unless it was swollen, was not a very good, if it was swollen, it wasn't a safe place to swim.

14:15.152 --> 14:21.060
Usually it was summertime when it was low and you could wade through most of it.

14:21.641 --> 14:23.764
It was, I'd hardly call it swimming.

14:24.265 --> 14:26.247
It was more just playing in the water.

14:27.289 --> 14:29.552
There was a place way south

14:30.983 --> 14:38.360
out of Millican that, I don't know, it was more of a place to swim and play in the water.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.224
We didn't go there much.

14:40.865 --> 14:45.195
It's about right, somebody drowned out there not long ago.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.963
Our mother took us out there.

14:48.983 --> 14:51.088
Well, it was too far away to begin with.

14:51.128 --> 14:56.522
I mean, you go clear to Millican and then go west from there toward Washington on the Brazos.

14:57.986 --> 15:02.678
And it was not a good place to go from a safety standpoint.

15:02.894 --> 15:17.808
All right, in the same era, late 30s, early 40s, church going, almost all the churches were either immediately north of the campus or on campus.

15:17.829 --> 15:26.957
We went to the Presbyterian church, which met first of all the YMCA, which had a chapel in it.

15:27.758 --> 15:32.783
It's not apparent now, but it's been divided horizontally.

15:33.235 --> 15:35.557
It was hard to envision it ever having a chapel.

15:36.838 --> 15:44.165
Now, later we met in Guyon Hall, which was the main assembly place for A&M students.

15:45.186 --> 15:49.831
And then, I guess toward the end of World War II, we met in the campus theater.

15:49.931 --> 15:54.716
And then about that time, they built their church then at the North Gate.

15:55.336 --> 16:00.841
Did anybody ever raise the question about any separation of church and state?

16:00.861 --> 16:01.202
Oh, no.

16:01.222 --> 16:02.483
Heaven forbid, no.

16:03.037 --> 16:04.178
I hadn't even thought of.

16:04.379 --> 16:10.886
And Mr. Cashin was a material, so that would have given a little bit of an in with the why.

16:11.988 --> 16:25.524
Now, there was a, what they called a Union Sunday School, which met many years ago in the basement of Guyon Hall, which was a very small, you might remember C.K.

16:25.704 --> 16:27.306
Eston having his,

16:28.265 --> 16:30.067
theater thing as offices.

16:30.147 --> 16:33.350
That was our Sunday school space many, many years ago.

16:34.050 --> 16:39.856
We later met in the assembly hall, which was the forerunner of the all-faith chapel.

16:40.677 --> 16:44.180
But that was sort of an all-denominational thing.

16:44.420 --> 16:50.286
It wasn't old Mrs. Campbell, I remember, ran that.

16:50.346 --> 16:50.686
C.B.

16:50.726 --> 16:55.731
Campbell, her husband was the, called it modern languages back then.

16:55.751 --> 16:56.972
I don't know what they call it now.

16:57.965 --> 17:01.071
People of that nature ran it.

17:01.953 --> 17:11.992
And then for church, as I say, we'd go to the YMCA, the Presbyterians did the Baptist and the Methodist had buildings at the North Gate.

17:12.032 --> 17:14.978
The Catholics had a building there.

17:16.038 --> 17:28.140
Church of Christ built a building there in mid-30s, which the Baptist ultimately bought and then finally sold their property and the Church of Christ to the Methodists

17:28.829 --> 17:32.432
And now I don't know what, I think they're in the process of wanting to do something.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.093
They're debating.

17:33.313 --> 17:35.475
They're debating now, okay, so.

17:35.975 --> 17:37.116
What about St.

17:37.176 --> 17:37.757
Thomas here?

17:37.897 --> 17:38.137
St.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.499
Thomas came into being, I think, in 1938.

17:40.679 --> 17:43.742
Okay, so it is there by the war.

17:45.083 --> 17:52.290
Was there any Jewish group meeting at all, you remember, during those years?

17:53.751 --> 17:57.755
There was a temple in Bryan, which I think is still there.

17:57.995 --> 17:58.195
Yes, yes.

17:58.681 --> 17:59.782
but not out here yet?

17:59.982 --> 18:06.209
Not, if they met, I was not aware of a place that they would have gone to.

18:07.311 --> 18:13.237
There was a man who ran a cleaning shop in Northgate, J.B.

18:13.277 --> 18:24.850
Lauderstein, who was a Jewish, he and his wife, and I think, I thought were active in their faith, but now where they went or what they did, I have no idea.

18:25.531 --> 18:26.612
Later,

18:28.398 --> 18:31.965
Oh, oh, fiddlesticks.

18:32.185 --> 18:32.866
Do you know him?

18:33.828 --> 18:35.070
In biochemistry?

18:35.110 --> 18:36.814
Yeah, you know who I'm talking about.

18:37.395 --> 18:38.236
He and his wife.

18:38.276 --> 18:39.659
Who were the leaders of the Jewish?

18:39.679 --> 18:41.502
Yes, yes, yes.

18:41.963 --> 18:42.124
Oh, boy.

18:42.144 --> 18:43.706
You know who I'm talking about.

18:44.227 --> 18:45.971
They were the leaders of the Jewish.

18:45.991 --> 18:48.155
Richard was the son's name.

18:48.275 --> 18:50.980
Oh, well.

18:51.787 --> 18:54.290
I'm glad to know it slipped your mind.

18:54.310 --> 18:55.992
But now you know what I'm talking about.

18:56.032 --> 19:02.340
Do you remember any incidents of religious difficulty?

19:05.383 --> 19:19.380
Like when I've interviewed people like Melvin Maltz, a very active former student who was Jewish, I asked him did he ever have to put up with anything that getting gigged or teased or anything.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.241
He said, oh, no.

19:21.132 --> 19:22.854
And I asked him, well, what was yours?

19:22.874 --> 19:24.156
You all had a nickname.

19:24.176 --> 19:24.897
I know everybody.

19:24.917 --> 19:25.458
What was yours?

19:25.478 --> 19:26.779
And he said mine was Jew Boy.

19:27.320 --> 19:32.747
But he said that never, I never heard it as a put down, and I don't think anybody attended as a put down.

19:32.767 --> 19:34.950
No, I can remember he was being called that.

19:34.970 --> 19:41.098
And he said that was my identifier, and I was proud to be Jewish, and nobody ever gave me a hard time about it.

19:41.551 --> 19:45.099
No, we had religious emphasis weeks on campus.

19:45.641 --> 19:47.886
Were those there in Europe?

19:48.067 --> 19:50.111
That goes up to my time.

19:50.252 --> 19:55.003
I was going to say, and I don't, everybody, Catholics, Jews, everybody went.

19:55.023 --> 19:57.369
I mean, they were, you know, well-known speakers.

19:57.629 --> 20:00.015
Was religious emphasis week going in the 40s?

20:03.742 --> 20:04.985
Don't think so.

20:05.326 --> 20:11.981
I remember I entered school in 45, the fall of 45, and it was going then.

20:12.001 --> 20:12.642
Oh, it was?

20:12.762 --> 20:13.524
Okay.

20:13.544 --> 20:19.918
Now whether it came in before that, I'm not sure.

20:20.159 --> 20:22.003
I probably,

20:22.203 --> 20:25.388
right at the end of World War I or II.

20:25.668 --> 20:27.812
Let's back up to just before the war.

20:28.293 --> 20:34.642
Who were some of the campus student celebrities that you remember when you were a younger kid?

20:35.804 --> 20:36.726
Celebrities?

20:38.789 --> 20:38.889
Yeah.

20:38.909 --> 20:39.871
Oh, my goodness.

20:39.891 --> 20:41.413
Was John Kimbrough a celebrity?

20:41.433 --> 20:42.555
Oh, yes, yes.

20:42.635 --> 20:43.917
Heaven forbid, yes.

20:44.298 --> 20:47.242
What kind of personality did he seem to have?

20:47.963 --> 20:50.387
Well, of course, I didn't know him that well.

20:50.705 --> 20:56.354
thought of him as an easy going big daddy type sort of a guy.

20:56.394 --> 21:04.207
Chip Rout was here with Joe and Chip Rout and Joe Rout Boulevard was named.

21:05.088 --> 21:15.345
Of course John Kimbrough had a brother Wallace Kimbrough who married a Bryan girl and was here.

21:17.097 --> 21:20.801
Now, was he the one, he had a brother that had a physical handicap?

21:21.282 --> 21:21.582
Was that?

21:21.602 --> 21:22.363
That was Wallace.

21:22.383 --> 21:23.565
Was that Wallace?

21:23.665 --> 21:24.506
I've forgotten that one.

21:24.526 --> 21:26.008
He limped, I think.

21:26.028 --> 21:26.248
All right.

21:26.328 --> 21:30.112
Let me tell you to get it on this machine that I've heard.

21:30.132 --> 21:31.274
I don't know whether it's true or not.

21:31.314 --> 21:31.935
I hope it is.

21:33.617 --> 21:42.447
That young John Kimbrough, as a freshman, goes to Tulane, which had a real red hot football team then.

21:44.485 --> 21:50.372
And this is the beginning of his freshman year and he's working out two or three days, but he's a little bit homesick.

21:51.473 --> 22:00.524
And his brother comes over and he goes with his brother to see if somebody can help his brother get a job, but he's got this bad leg.

22:01.485 --> 22:06.831
And whomever they talk to, Tulane, one of the coaches or something or other, you know,

22:07.385 --> 22:10.651
football players are always wanting some, what the heck, we're not, you know.

22:11.453 --> 22:19.068
And so he comes back to his room and in frustration packs up and says he's going to come back to Texas, be closer home.

22:20.170 --> 22:28.667
His freshman roommate hears that and decides that he too will leave, that he didn't like it down there, and he was going to go back home to Michigan.

22:29.407 --> 22:35.975
So Tommy Herman and John Kimbrough shook hands and went to the train.

22:35.995 --> 22:36.595
You're kidding.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.098
I hope that story is true.

22:39.339 --> 22:40.720
It's a great story.

22:40.841 --> 22:41.802
I've not heard it.

22:41.822 --> 22:49.311
Because the Heisman Trophy winner, Herman, and the All-American fullback, John Kimbrough, shook hands and parted.

22:49.331 --> 22:50.632
Would have been a pretty good pair.

22:50.652 --> 22:52.134
Oh, man, alive.

22:52.594 --> 22:53.055
Let's see.

22:54.817 --> 22:59.042
Coach Norton, what was he like?

22:59.022 --> 23:00.531
to a young man?

23:01.014 --> 23:04.695
If we weren't close to him, I don't suppose

23:05.232 --> 23:10.000
I ever saw him other than passing by in an automobile or something, you know.

23:10.120 --> 23:11.682
But you didn't hear that he was a?

23:12.163 --> 23:12.684
Oh, no.

23:12.704 --> 23:16.149
He was the epitome of everything good as far as I know.

23:16.490 --> 23:25.043
You know, I don't, you know, all these people were, you know, we were saints, you know, up there somewhere, you know.

23:25.404 --> 23:29.250
What did you and your buddies do on a football day here?

23:29.671 --> 23:31.273
You went to the games.

23:31.253 --> 23:36.145
Did y'all have tickets or did you work your way in or sell programs or what?

23:36.225 --> 23:42.100
We didn't sell programs and if we had to we could pay 50 cents and get in the knothole section.

23:42.942 --> 23:47.473
But I think we could even sneak in probably, in fact I've got a scar on my

23:48.179 --> 24:03.143
It wasn't a football game, it was a baseball game, climbing over a fence, and it was a stub of a barbed wire sticking out barefooted, and it ripped my foot open down here across the ball of my foot.

24:03.243 --> 24:05.427
I don't think that kept me from going to the game.

24:05.527 --> 24:13.680
I think I went ahead and intended to do it after I got home, but I think the scar is still on the bottom of my foot.

24:14.437 --> 24:25.673
Oh, you'd pick up bottles sometime afterwards and the coke people would give you a little bit of nothing for gathering up the bottles because paper cups and things were unheard of back at that time.

24:25.753 --> 24:29.158
You'd pick up the bottles, but we'd go.

24:29.178 --> 24:37.410
In fact, the first, not the first game, but there was an SMU game in that famous 1939 year.

24:39.033 --> 24:44.140
It was cold, raining, I mean freezing.

24:44.339 --> 24:44.860
old.

24:46.202 --> 25:02.348
And I remember sitting behind Pat Orr, who later married Dean of Business School at Harvard, Fouracre, Larry Fouracre, later married, and I can remember

25:02.750 --> 25:18.144
Pat Orr had a cup of coffee in her hand, it's cold, cold day, and she poured it down the neck of the guy in front of her, for I have no other earthly reason why, but I think he sort of welcomed it.

25:18.164 --> 25:22.287
It was warm, but it was startling nevertheless.

25:22.467 --> 25:27.292
Why Pat did that, I'll never know, but she's still up in Boston.

25:27.332 --> 25:31.255
Larry died, but she's still up in Boston.

25:31.235 --> 25:47.034
All right, so you enter in the fall of 45, and the campus was then very chaotic with all of the various units, the special training units.

25:48.115 --> 25:51.960
Yes, by then they had

25:52.565 --> 25:57.876
Let's see, the war ended actually in August of 45, and I'm talking about September.

25:57.956 --> 25:58.397
Oh, September.

25:58.818 --> 25:58.959
Oh, oh.

25:58.979 --> 25:59.961
A month later.

26:00.041 --> 26:01.123
So the war was actually.

26:01.143 --> 26:02.005
I was thinking it was January.

26:02.025 --> 26:02.646
Okay, September.

26:02.867 --> 26:03.628
September.

26:04.570 --> 26:08.719
I believe most of those units had pretty well departed by then.

26:08.739 --> 26:12.868
I think with the ending of the war in Europe, uh,

26:13.287 --> 26:14.949
this was not a problem.

26:15.009 --> 26:22.938
Now, when I was in high school, much congestion on the campus with what they call those guys.

26:26.061 --> 26:31.667
There were Navy, Marine, Army, all branches were there.

26:34.971 --> 26:41.438
But by the time I entered, the veterans were first coming back at that time.

26:42.329 --> 26:50.721
And so that first year was somewhat, well, the whole period of time was chaotic.

26:50.741 --> 26:55.989
You know, guys were coming back, being released from the service and coming into school.

26:56.189 --> 27:01.557
Now, I'm assuming there weren't many vets in September, but by January, I presume.

27:01.577 --> 27:03.720
By January, there were, yes.

27:03.900 --> 27:09.568
That's right, because it was just, we were a month away from the bombing of

27:09.650 --> 27:14.217
Do you remember anything about the application for admission process?

27:15.739 --> 27:18.583
Well, if it was very complex, I wouldn't have gotten in.

27:21.989 --> 27:22.810
Not really.

27:25.073 --> 27:27.256
Well, of course, it was all over at Sebiza Hall.

27:27.317 --> 27:31.002
I mean, you'd just line up and go and pick out whatever course.

27:31.022 --> 27:34.808
There were just tables lined up there, and you picked out the courses you want.

27:35.930 --> 27:38.273
Guidance, very little.

27:39.518 --> 27:43.245
I can try to remember some of the people who were very helpful.

27:43.285 --> 27:45.089
Tom Harrington was one.

27:46.051 --> 27:50.459
You could go into Tom Harrington's office and he would solve your problem.

27:51.060 --> 27:55.349
Maybe not to your liking, but he didn't send you off somewhere else.

27:56.230 --> 27:57.453
He took care of it.

27:58.214 --> 27:58.655
J.P.

27:58.775 --> 28:00.278
Abbott was this way.

28:00.933 --> 28:02.355
who taught English.

28:02.495 --> 28:17.534
I had him for an English class, you know, wonderful teacher, but later as he became a dean or head of the department or something in the enrolling process, J.P.

28:17.674 --> 28:18.776
Abbott and M.T.

28:18.816 --> 28:21.439
Harrington would take care of your problems.

28:22.145 --> 28:31.115
You quite often would get sent to the moon if you went to say, well, you've got to go do this, or you've got to go over here and do that, or, you know, this type thing.

28:31.175 --> 28:32.517
But not with them.

28:32.557 --> 28:35.721
They'd pick up the phone and solve your problem.

28:37.002 --> 28:39.705
And when you started out, what you thought was going to be your major?

28:40.626 --> 28:42.028
Aeronautical engineering.

28:42.068 --> 28:43.590
I had learned to fly.

28:43.630 --> 28:46.112
In fact, I had a private pilot's license.

28:46.213 --> 28:48.355
I was like JFK Jr.

28:49.246 --> 29:11.203
In May, in my, well, no, I didn't at that time, but in the spring of 45, high school, I worked out at Coulter Field in Bryan, and they paid me in flying time, three hours a week, as I remember, for, you know, maintaining the planes and being there on the weekends and whatever.

29:12.247 --> 29:15.512
And I took my, well that's right, I wasn't old enough.

29:15.552 --> 29:16.393
I was 17.

29:16.413 --> 29:18.256
I think I had to wait until I was 18.

29:18.276 --> 29:29.793
No, that's not true either because January of 46, I got my private pilot's license.

29:31.395 --> 29:33.619
That was the middle of my freshman year.

29:33.639 --> 29:34.440
That's pretty special.

29:35.281 --> 29:39.386
Well, it was, except I've never flown since.

29:39.406 --> 29:41.049
None of your buddies had a home.

29:41.069 --> 29:41.569
Oh, no.

29:41.689 --> 29:49.580
And I can remember the first time my father, I mean, the idea of flying in an airplane, you know, this was unheard of.

29:50.441 --> 30:00.354
Oh, yeah, this was a big deal, but I'd still have a private license, but as I said, I've never flown too expensive.

30:00.374 --> 30:03.398
Those first courses, which ones were memorable?

30:04.745 --> 30:08.169
English, JP Abbott.

30:08.750 --> 30:10.192
Oh, he was your freshman English teacher?

30:13.176 --> 30:16.380
Describe him as a classroom teacher.

30:19.243 --> 30:25.371
Somewhat formal, dignified, yet open, very open.

30:27.914 --> 30:32.760
You had the feeling that he cared about you.

30:33.955 --> 30:36.899
You didn't get by with much, you know.

30:36.939 --> 30:38.862
He was firm.

30:42.648 --> 30:43.289
Let's see.

30:45.792 --> 30:47.074
Well, I think that's about it.

30:47.094 --> 30:48.656
He was just somebody you liked.

30:48.736 --> 30:49.978
He had a good smile, didn't he?

30:49.998 --> 30:50.499
Oh, yeah.

30:50.519 --> 30:51.000
Oh, yeah.

30:51.020 --> 30:52.021
A very good smile.

30:54.345 --> 30:55.486
Goodness gracious.

30:55.787 --> 30:57.850
I had a... Science, math.

30:57.870 --> 30:59.192
Yes, science.

30:59.272 --> 31:00.133
Heaven forbid.

31:00.193 --> 31:03.658
I went through chemistry 101, and who did I have?

31:05.377 --> 31:06.258
I had M.T.

31:06.338 --> 31:10.483
Harrington as a, you know, you met in the big place, and you had your lecture.

31:11.844 --> 31:19.372
I had Dr. Harrington for one of those, and a fellow by the name of McGinnis was my class teacher.

31:20.714 --> 31:22.376
I wasn't cut out for chemistry.

31:22.416 --> 31:26.000
I think I passed it, but this was not one of my fortes.

31:26.180 --> 31:28.022
What about Dr. Harrington as a lecturer?

31:28.282 --> 31:30.064
Oh, excellent, excellent, yes.

31:30.565 --> 31:31.205
Good voice.

31:31.406 --> 31:35.350
Strong voice, very firm, very thorough, you know.

31:35.684 --> 31:43.143
If you didn't get it, it was because your own receptors weren't working.

31:43.664 --> 31:46.150
No, it was very strong.
