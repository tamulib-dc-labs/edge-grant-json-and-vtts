00:07.439 --> 00:09.581
You were saying about French oceanography. I was 
saying about French, but you can't say anything

00:09.601 --> 00:32.720
that

00:09.601 --> 00:32.720
any particular kind of oceanography is very 
typical of France, because they have different

00:09.601 --> 00:32.720
groups that have different ways of doing things 
and different objectives. One group is led by

00:32.740 --> 00:34.582
Jacques Cousteau. He's primarily an engineer. 
rather than a scientist. He doesn't claim to be a

00:40.123 --> 00:41.565
scientist. He's interested in using underwater 
photography and underwater vehicles and seeing

00:44.028 --> 01:08.074
what you can do with them and developing the 
capabilities of these devices and developing new

00:44.028 --> 01:08.074
devices, new kinds of underwater vehicles,

00:44.028 --> 01:08.074
new

00:44.028 --> 01:08.074
kinds of seeing underwater.

01:10.737 --> 01:18.167
And, of course, they take beautiful photographs, 
and they've used these underwater vehicles in

01:10.737 --> 01:18.167
many interesting ways. The bathyscape, for 
example. It's the thing that they use in the

01:22.573 --> 01:29.703
submarine with this diving turtle that they use in 
the more shallow water.

01:33.128 --> 01:38.415
And there's another group that works for the 
office organization The French are interested

01:39.222 --> 02:03.795
in either the

01:39.222 --> 02:03.795
present French overseas possessions or former 
French overseas possessions like Madagascar,

01:39.222 --> 02:03.795
present French overseas possessions like New 
Caledonia and Tahiti.

02:06.543 --> 02:26.942
One of my good friends, a man named Henri Roche, who 
works for Forrestal in New Caledonia, he has a ship

02:06.543 --> 02:26.942
which does physical and chemical and biological 
oceanography

02:06.543 --> 02:26.942
in the southern tropical Pacific, with 
headquarters in New Caledonia. Another one

02:28.123 --> 02:35.470
was also a script of Michelle Ongo, a station for 
many years in Madagascar.

02:41.845 --> 02:46.793
And he's concerned primarily with fisheries.

02:46.813 --> 03:04.140
They do just standard oceanography, and 
particularly biological oceanography,

02:46.813 --> 03:04.140
but confining themselves to mostly the waters 
within 1,000 miles of the place where they're

02:46.813 --> 03:04.140
stationed. And there's a third group in the 
University of Paris

03:05.082 --> 03:21.828
and in the universities and other universities in 
France who do theoretical or quasi-theoretical

03:05.082 --> 03:21.828
oceanography. Some of them are very good.

03:26.535 --> 03:33.165
Particularly, they've been concerned with

03:26.535 --> 03:33.165
hydrodynamics of the motions in the ocean, and 
with visible light, transmitting propagation of

03:34.259 --> 03:43.229
light in the ocean. And they do a lot of more or less 
classical marine biology in the Mediterranean,

03:45.572 --> 04:02.190
and the Côte d'Ivoire, and the Bay of Biscay, and 
places like that.

04:03.284 --> 04:10.495
At least there are at least three or four different 
kinds of oceanography done in France. In general,

04:10.515 --> 04:12.457
it hasn't been supported very well. They haven't 
done very much to bring new people into it. It's a

04:16.564 --> 04:21.270
very small group in France. That's in general true 
of the fact that oceanography is a small science.

04:29.322 --> 04:31.165
It's generally true of Most countries, the only 
countries where it's a big science, quote big

04:32.022 --> 04:53.791
science in the sense that a lot of money is spent, 
are the United States and the Soviet Union, and to a

04:32.022 --> 04:53.791
lesser extent, the United Kingdom and Japan.

04:53.811 --> 04:57.135
Everywhere else, they try to do things more or less 
on the cheap.

05:00.187 --> 05:08.019
And of course, most of the less developed 
countries have very, very limited facilities and

05:00.187 --> 05:08.019
very limited personnel. And the result is

05:08.120 --> 05:17.354
that it's hard to do much cooperative 
emotionography with the less developed

05:08.120 --> 05:17.354
countries. Now, you proposed one time that sort of 
an international foundation for supporting

05:17.374 --> 05:25.587
science should be established to encourage 
science in underdeveloped countries. Whatever

05:27.224 --> 05:28.326
happened to that idea? Well, it's going. It 
exists. That was not to do with oceanography. No.

05:32.953 --> 05:34.335
It was to support individual science. Right. The 
headquarters of it are in Stockholm. It's called

05:37.139 --> 05:39.302
the International Foundation for Science. 
They're spending about $250,000 a year in

05:40.664 --> 05:53.262
supporting young scientists in developing 
countries on practical or research that looks

05:40.664 --> 05:53.262
like it had practical would produce practical 
benefits. This was proposed in Venice in 1965, if I

05:56.786 --> 06:01.130
remember correctly. When was the foundation 
organized? Well, it had its first general

06:03.472 --> 06:06.235
assembly last fall. Oh, OK. But it's been going now 
for several years, and it's building up the last

06:08.577 --> 06:24.632
year for years under the leadership of the Swedish 
Academy of Engineering, and with participation

06:08.577 --> 06:24.632
by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and 
the National Academy of Sciences. It's, however,

06:25.777 --> 06:32.205
the Americans have never put any money into it, 
except a little bit for the Rockefeller

06:25.777 --> 06:32.205
Foundation. The money for supporting it at the 
present time comes from the Swedish government,

06:32.245 --> 06:48.807
Canadian government, from Japan, and the 
Netherlands, and Belgium, and a little bit from

06:32.245 --> 06:48.807
other Scandinavian countries, and Germany. And 
one of the things that I've got to do sometime if I

06:54.987 --> 07:00.056
possibly can, is to try to find ways of getting 
American support for it, too. They're supporting

07:00.657 --> 07:16.063
now about 50 young scientists in developing 
countries working on all sorts of very

07:00.657 --> 07:16.063
interesting projects that have two 
characteristics. They're good science, and they

07:16.423 --> 07:19.729
also have practical objectives. For example, one 
of the specialties in Scandinavia is the study of

07:20.384 --> 07:25.130
mycorrhizae. Mycorrhizae are fungi that live on 
the roots of pine trees. And in fact, a pine tree

07:32.000 --> 07:40.311
can't live without these symbiotic fungi, which 
absorb nutrients from the soil and transmit them

07:32.000 --> 07:40.311
to the roots. It's a rather recent discovery that 
these things exist. The recent discovery is that

07:44.216 --> 07:48.602
they're very widespread. They've been known to 
exist for 75 years, I guess. Apparently, all

07:54.026 --> 08:03.298
tropical plants require these mycorrhizae, not 
just the pine

07:54.026 --> 08:03.298
trees. They act as a transmission belt for 
nutrients, so the nutrients are recycled in the

08:03.959 --> 08:14.573
biosphere and don't go through the soil.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.622
Scandinavian specialty. You might imagine that 
they have lots of pine trees. And they found young

08:21.027 --> 08:44.914
scientists in Malaysia and in Nigeria and in South 
America and other parts of Africa and other parts

08:21.027 --> 08:44.914
of Asia, each of whom is working on mycorrhizae, 
the physiology,

08:46.413 --> 08:52.399
role that they play in the symbiotic relationship 
of the tree and so forth. And this has several good

08:52.419 --> 08:56.163
things about it. One of them is that these young 
people have formed a network of their own. They're

08:59.907 --> 09:09.536
communicating with each other from one blessed of 
all country to another, which they didn't even

08:59.907 --> 09:09.536
know the others existed before. The other thing is 
that the Scandinavian scientists monitor this.

09:16.163 --> 09:38.596
and go out and see them every now and then and help 
out with ideas and with literature and with

09:16.163 --> 09:38.596
equipment

09:16.163 --> 09:38.596
and with encouragement, feeling that they're 
doing something worth doing and not living in

09:16.163 --> 09:38.596
complete isolation. So I think it's working out 
wonderfully well. And the only real problem is

09:42.944 --> 09:46.252
it's on far too small a scale. But that's a far cry 
from oceanography.

09:54.411 --> 10:00.565
But in terms of oceanography, we have a very 
serious problem in the developing countries.

10:09.573 --> 10:16.043
Those of us who were involved with forming the 
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission

10:09.573 --> 10:16.043
were partly responsible for this.

10:19.268 --> 10:21.291
Although I'm not sure that I know what else we could 
have done. The

10:21.331 --> 10:37.977
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission 
was formed under the sponsorship of UNESCO about

10:21.331 --> 10:37.977
1960,

10:21.331 --> 10:37.977
starting in 1959.

10:39.931 --> 10:45.780
Most of the preliminary work was done by a small 
committee that I was chairman of, a small

10:39.931 --> 10:45.780
international committee. That's the 
International Advisory Committee on Marine

10:46.320 --> 10:49.165
Sciences? No, that was earlier. That was 57 to 63, 
okay. I think it was actually the International

10:52.790 --> 10:58.799
Advisory Committee on Marine Sciences was much 
older than that. I think it was 51 or 52. That was the

11:04.247 --> 11:06.310
UNESCO Advisory Committee. Well, this was a 
special group of experts called together by

11:07.437 --> 11:14.148
UNESCO, I think 1959. John Lyman was one of them, 
and Vladimir Kort was another from Russia. I was

11:20.117 --> 11:27.709
the American

11:20.117 --> 11:27.709
representative. We made a preliminary plan for 
the IOC, and the essence of our plan was that any

11:27.729 --> 11:33.799
country could join it who wanted to do cooperative 
research at sea. Well, that was a very narrow

11:39.531 --> 11:45.016
definition, unfortunately. But it really said 
that those countries that could afford to do

11:45.036 --> 11:51.022
oceanographic research at sea could join it.

11:55.346 --> 12:01.052
And that limited it basically to, it didn't really 
limit it,

12:12.743 --> 12:16.669
It de facto was a club of rich countries. Soviet 
Union, Germany, France, UK, Japan, United

12:16.689 --> 12:25.724
States, Canada.

12:25.884 --> 12:27.186
Italy and Spain were members. The Scandinavian 
countries were all members, including Finland.

12:31.233 --> 12:40.067
They're not rich in the sense that they have big 
populations with big incomes, or big gross

12:31.233 --> 12:40.067
national products. They have the fat on their 
bones. They have high per capita income. And

12:45.129 --> 12:49.753
they're able to devote considerable effort to 
science. Whereas the poor countries, like most of

12:49.773 --> 13:09.531
the African countries, most of the South American

12:49.773 --> 13:09.531
countries, most of the Asian countries, are in 
such a desperate shape just keeping their people

12:49.773 --> 13:09.531
alive that they can't really, that oceanography 
is It was a luxury for them.

13:14.927 --> 13:19.554
And yet they feel that somehow the ocean belonged 
to the ocean. Much of the ocean as possible should

13:19.574 --> 13:21.536
belong to them.

13:24.841 --> 13:33.733
And this has come out very clearly in these Law of 
the Sea Conferences.

13:33.753 --> 13:37.358
I don't think it's unfair to say that a great many of 
these less developed countries, which has

13:39.008 --> 13:44.556
assumed not sea oceanography done off their 
coasts.

13:48.361 --> 13:53.868
Because they feel that somehow this gives the rich 
countries an advantage in exploiting what they

13:48.361 --> 13:53.868
call their resources.

13:58.775 --> 14:08.188
Since the law of the sea conference is run by 
politicians and diplomats with very little

13:58.775 --> 14:08.188
concept of what science is all about,

14:11.324 --> 14:21.614
Science is taking a very, oceanographic science, 
I'm afraid, is taking a bad fall in those law of the

14:11.324 --> 14:21.614
sea negotiations. The problem is basically this.

14:28.621 --> 14:40.673
The less developed countries, the group of 77, and 
some developed countries like Canada and

14:28.621 --> 14:40.673
Australia,

14:28.621 --> 14:40.673
want what we oceanography that's called a consent 
regime, which means that the coastal state must

14:40.872 --> 15:01.112
give its consent for any oceanographic research 
done within 200 miles or within its economic zone,

14:40.872 --> 15:01.112
wherever the economic zone will be defined.

15:03.534 --> 15:09.580
Convenient definition is 200 miles beyond the 
territorial sea, which itself would extend 12

15:03.534 --> 15:09.580
miles from shore. About 40% of the ocean will be in 
somebody's economic field. And most of the

15:16.300 --> 15:23.329
interesting phenomena on the ocean occur within 
this 200 mile limit. Most of the geology, most of

15:23.349 --> 15:30.699
the geophysics, most of the currents, most of the 
organisms, most of the resources.

15:34.124 --> 15:39.111
So this consent

15:34.124 --> 15:39.111
regime which looks innocent enough, will in fact 
maybe destroy oceanography as we've done in the

15:39.918 --> 15:45.184
past. We've had experience with it

15:46.466 --> 16:08.693
in the application of the Continental Shelf 
Convention, an international convention

15:46.466 --> 16:08.693
established in 1958 and now coming to force, which 
provides that the coastal state must give its

15:46.466 --> 16:08.693
consent for research on the seabed and subsoil of 
the continental shelf off its coast, as far out as

16:08.909 --> 16:19.899
this continental shelf can. And a lot of you know 
you'll write a letter to one of some of these

16:19.919 --> 16:23.863
countries. You don't even reply. And if they do 
reply, they very often, not uncommon, they deny

16:26.205 --> 16:30.409
consent.

16:34.273 --> 16:38.477
So the oceanographers have proposed what we call a 
regime of rights and obligations.

16:41.849 --> 16:45.633
This has slowly evolved over the past 10, 12 years. 
The right is that anybody can do oceanographic

16:46.914 --> 16:57.784
research anywhere outside the territorial sea, 
provided he lives up to the following

16:46.914 --> 16:57.784
obligations. One, prompt notification of the 
coastal state if you want to do the research there.

17:05.291 --> 17:10.776
Second, coastal states will have the right of full 
participation in the research at sea. In other

17:12.190 --> 17:15.853
words, send one or more people on board the ship. 
We'll have complete access to everything on the

17:16.394 --> 17:18.615
ship. One of the reasons for this is to avoid 
another Phoenix incident.

17:30.085 --> 17:36.110
In other words, to ensure that these ships are not 
used for espionage. Third, the right of the

17:36.130 --> 17:41.455
Coastal State, an obligation on the part of the 
researching state, is to share all data and

17:42.447 --> 17:53.076
samples, give copies of all the data to the coastal 
state and parts of all samples. The fourth right,

17:53.096 --> 18:02.044
or the fourth duty, is prompt publication in the 
open scientific literature of the results.

18:05.227 --> 18:11.813
Fifth, or sixth, I forgot how many numbers I have. 
the duty on the part of the researching state to

18:12.974 --> 18:18.482
help the coastal state in interpreting the 
results. Because the coastal states say, well,

18:19.404 --> 18:24.832
what good are all these data to us if we don't have 
the scientists to understand what they mean? And

18:25.913 --> 18:28.537
that's a legitimate complaint. And finally, we 
have not been very enthusiastic about this, but

18:29.819 --> 18:41.817
we've agreed, I think, that the coastal state

18:29.819 --> 18:41.817
also has the right to object. And

18:42.083 --> 19:00.530
if it does object and it has valid grounds for 
objection, the research will not be done. The

19:00.831 --> 19:09.964
decision as to whether the grounds for objection 
are valid would be subject to arbitration.

19:10.670 --> 19:25.027
perhaps by a group of experts appointed by UNESCO, 
by the IOC, the Governmental Oceanographic

19:10.670 --> 19:25.027
Commission, or in some other way,

19:10.670 --> 19:25.027
to get to be negotiated.

19:28.271 --> 19:35.099
And it seems to us oceanographers that this set of 
rights and obligations protects all the

19:28.271 --> 19:35.099
interests of the coastal state. There have been 
various alterations of this the most plausible

19:40.117 --> 19:55.120
and yet the most difficult to

19:40.117 --> 19:55.120
use operationally would be that research related 
to the resources would be subject to consent of the

19:40.117 --> 19:55.120
coastal state. Research related to fundamental 
science would be done on this more freer basis.

20:04.994 --> 20:09.381
The trouble is, how do you define research related 
to resources, or how do you define fundamental

20:04.994 --> 20:09.381
research? Oceanographers have tried to define it 
by saying that it shall be published in the open

20:10.120 --> 20:17.347
scientific literature. It will not be 
proprietary in any way.

20:25.155 --> 20:28.239
Many of the coastal states of the Middle East and 
other countries don't want that. They want to keep

20:28.259 --> 20:36.347
the information private about the waters off 
their coast. And they object, among other

20:38.875 --> 20:55.197
reasons, because, well, they have all sorts of 
objections, but a reason which would have seemed

20:38.875 --> 20:55.197
logical to some of our people a few years ago is that 
if you find out about waters within 200 miles of the

20:57.455 --> 21:03.383
coastline, you get useful military information. 
For example, how a submarine can glide, or how

21:03.403 --> 21:14.837
effectively a sonar gear will operate, and things

21:03.403 --> 21:14.837
like that. And I guess that it's not unlikely that 
this consent regime will be

21:14.857 --> 21:27.073
the proof will be the one that's approved by the Law 
of the Sea Conference. If so, I think it would be

21:34.991 --> 21:40.457
better not to have any convention at all, any 
treaty at all. Because this will, as far as the

21:43.100 --> 21:56.335
ocean research is concerned, it will be a very 
serious setback

21:43.100 --> 21:56.335
to it. One of the things that's been put in lately, 
and it's called a single negotiating text, is that

21:58.272 --> 22:13.532
the coastal states shall have the right to 
disallow, prohibit, or prevent publication of

21:58.272 --> 22:13.532
the results. You just can't get scientists to work 
unless they can publish the results of what they

22:13.552 --> 22:17.998
do. So all in all, it will be very damaging. And what 
it'll do is tend to turn oceanography towards

22:28.057 --> 22:49.845
local problems and towards experimental and 
theoretical science rather than descriptive

22:28.057 --> 22:49.845
science or international ocean science. in

22:50.669 --> 22:59.139
the sense that the whole ocean is studied, were his 
last words. We would have done better if we'd paid

22:59.159 --> 23:05.707
more attention to the less developed countries in 
the early days of the IOC. And

23:06.067 --> 23:19.123
the IOC has continually given sort of lip service 
to helping the less developed countries. But

23:20.386 --> 23:24.292
nobody's ever known quite what to do. It's hard to 
help them in ocean science

23:26.735 --> 23:35.107
because it's way down their list of priorities.

23:39.774 --> 23:49.228
And as I say, most of the politicians in these 
countries feel that science is a rich man's weapon

23:39.774 --> 23:49.228
or a rich man's tool. Therefore, some of you 
doesn't serve their interests. Have you noticed

23:53.601 --> 23:59.271
much conflict between the developed countries in 
terms of defense industry and oceanographic

23:53.601 --> 23:59.271
science? What do you mean by that? Well, do you 
think that possibly the concepts of defense and

24:02.717 --> 24:14.997
protection interfere with international 
cooperation, let's say, between the Soviet

24:02.717 --> 24:14.997
Union, ourselves, Australia, Japan, for 
example?

24:22.520 --> 24:27.047
Well, they certainly interfere in some aspects of 
international cooperation with the Soviets. The

24:28.649 --> 24:33.677
Soviets have always taken a dim view of anybody 
getting too close to their shores.

24:37.022 --> 24:48.299
And for example, in the Arctic,

24:37.022 --> 24:48.299
our people pretty much stay out of the Soviet 
sector of the Arctic.

24:48.319 --> 24:50.282
And they pretty much stay out of ours. nowhere near 
as much as we stay out of there.

25:00.626 --> 25:11.600
I don't think that,

25:00.626 --> 25:11.600
in general, it's a very serious matter for most of 
the rich countries. It's a serious matter with the

25:11.620 --> 25:14.223
poor countries. For example, with all of South 
America.

25:21.245 --> 25:25.350
with India, very serious with India.

25:31.218 --> 25:50.323
Now, if you asked me earlier on what was the 
necessity or the virtue of the benefits of

25:31.218 --> 25:50.323
international cooperation,

25:31.218 --> 25:50.323
the benefits come mostly

25:52.784 --> 26:07.067
in studying the large-scale oceanographic 
phenomena, like the Kuroshio, the Gulf Stream, or

25:52.784 --> 26:07.067
the Somali Current, or the equatorial current 
system.

26:10.452 --> 26:20.648
Or

26:10.452 --> 26:20.648
problems that require,

26:10.452 --> 26:20.648
in general, problems that require the operation 
several ships at the same time and in a coordinated

26:21.134 --> 26:26.561
way. For example, some of the work that's being 
done under the Global Atmospheric Research

26:28.804 --> 26:48.829
Program, the GATE experiment in the Atlantic,

26:28.804 --> 26:48.829
the work that's being done on a network of buoys 
fairly close together. a couple hundred miles,

26:49.568 --> 27:00.118
covering an area a few hundred miles on the side,

26:49.568 --> 27:00.118
which has a special name. I don't remember the name 
right now.

27:05.422 --> 27:18.394
Work like that, where oceanographers of several 
countries

27:05.422 --> 27:18.394
want to work together to study a phenomenon that 
they can't really study with the resources

27:19.522 --> 27:21.764
available to any one institution.

27:24.987 --> 27:29.410
Certainly, it's a good reason for international 
cooperation. It doesn't have to be worldwide

27:30.912 --> 27:33.013
cooperation. It could be cooperation bilateral 
between the United States and the United Kingdom,

27:33.033 --> 27:40.680
for example.

27:40.700 --> 27:49.427
I think one of the most successful examples of 
international cooperation is the deep sea

27:40.700 --> 27:49.427
drilling program. which is now actually being 
supported financially by six countries. Soviet

27:58.911 --> 28:01.333
Union, the United Kingdom, Germany. I guess it's 
five countries. Soviet Union, United Kingdom,

28:04.176 --> 28:08.121
Germany, United States, and Japan. And the Soviet 
Union putting a million dollars a year into it for

28:10.303 --> 28:15.769
the English. And this is probably the most 
productive work in geophysics ever done. It's

28:27.591 --> 28:36.904
fantastically productive of new knowledge and 
new results.

28:38.125 --> 28:46.617
As you probably know, it has an elaborate advisory

28:38.125 --> 28:46.617
structure under something called JOIDES, Joint 
Ocean Institutions, Deep Sea

28:47.542 --> 29:01.039
Explorations,

28:47.542 --> 29:01.039
Exploratory Studies, or something like that. The 
Deep, Joint Oceanographic Institutions.

29:08.609 --> 29:12.013
I forgot what DES stands for there. But Woods Hole, 
Lamont, Scripps, University of Washington,

29:12.033 --> 29:17.380
Texas A&M, Miami, I think Rhode Island and all 
these foreign countries are

29:18.372 --> 29:26.725
in it. They plan these things

29:26.765 --> 29:39.784
cooperatively and with a great deal of success.

29:40.986 --> 29:45.493
And scientists from all these different 
countries take part in expeditions. And each leg

29:46.351 --> 29:56.826
of the program, there's a different chief 
scientist from a different institution, maybe

29:46.351 --> 29:56.826
French or German or British or Japanese or 
American or Russian. And the participants are

29:58.569 --> 30:02.034
from a variety of countries. This program is 
managed by the Scripps Institution, and we have a

30:03.496 --> 30:11.548
special of Scripps that runs the drilling. And 
it's a very expensive operation.
