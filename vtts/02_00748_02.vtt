WEBVTT

00:01.212 --> 00:02.534
been one of your favorites? Oh yes, he was one of my 
favorites and

00:02.554 --> 00:11.204
Chastain was another. If we could get him, he was 
the history professor, and if we could get him to

00:11.224 --> 00:28.384
talking about the

00:11.224 --> 00:28.384
military campaigns of the Civil War, why We got a 
lecture, a talk, and we didn't have to do anything.

00:36.218 --> 00:39.460
He took care of it from there on.

00:40.662 --> 00:42.944
Nevertheless, I think he was a good teacher. And 
Deke Fountain in the English department, E.J.

00:54.013 --> 00:58.337
Fermier,

00:54.013 --> 00:58.337
and I suppose my favorite of all of them was Gilbert 
Allen Geist, who was a freehand drawing prof

00:59.228 --> 01:14.392
and a part of the architectural department, of 
course. You mentioned if you could get Mr.

01:14.412 --> 01:22.464
Chastain talking about a battle or a Civil War 
campaign, then you didn't have to do anything for

01:14.412 --> 01:22.464
the class. Did you normally have a recitation 
segment where He would ask questions and you would

01:27.207 --> 01:28.929
have to answer? He would ask questions, yes.

01:33.636 --> 01:36.800
And he was very strict on freshmen. There were 
times when we had more students in the section and

01:38.863 --> 01:52.000
there were chairs in the classroom.

01:52.300 --> 02:04.353
in those cases where the freshmen, some of the 
freshmen would have to sit in the windows so that

01:52.300 --> 02:04.353
the older students could have seats, chairs. But 
he was,

02:06.395 --> 02:19.168
in fact, he would ask questions in class and give 
you the answer himself,

02:23.300 --> 02:27.529
King Edward had 10,000 what in his army? 
Singletary? Men. That's right, that's right.

02:36.648 --> 02:37.329
Such as that. He was an entertaining sort of 
professor.

02:47.009 --> 02:51.155
What were the attitudes of the students towards 
the administration of the school? And I guess

02:51.255 --> 03:02.690
there was a dual administration with the 
president sort of in charge of academic matters

02:51.255 --> 03:02.690
and the commandant or the bull in charge of 
military matters. Was it a pretty cordial

03:04.252 --> 03:07.657
relationship, or was there some conflict? I think 
there was a good relationship between the two. The

03:11.121 --> 03:14.586
students... I generally didn't particularly 
like the

03:16.270 --> 03:25.221
first bull that we had there, Levi J. Brown, and Dr. 
Brazell was the, well, no, Catfish Milner was the

03:25.261 --> 03:45.906
president, I believe, when I went there, and then 
sometime after that, Dr. Brazell came, and I

03:25.261 --> 03:45.906
believe the second year. I recall Dr. Brazell

03:47.557 --> 03:56.850
apologizing to the students for the way he combed 
his hair. He partied it in the middle, and we

03:56.870 --> 04:00.976
thought that was sort of sissy.

04:04.461 --> 04:14.695
But Dr. Brazell was well liked, and the rest of the 
military instructors, most of them were pretty

04:04.461 --> 04:14.695
well liked. Among those, I think old Sergeant 
Kinney was one of the

04:15.856 --> 04:23.948
best liked. He was an old retired sergeant. And 
then later on, William H.H. Morris, who later

04:30.657 --> 04:44.277
became lieutenant general and in command of the 
Caribbean area during World War II, was very

04:30.657 --> 04:44.277
popular with the students. Was he a military 
instructor? Yes. And also he was an instructor in

04:49.387 --> 04:56.859
the training camp at Leon Springs when we went in 
service.

05:00.063 --> 05:07.174
There was a period in the early 20th century where 
on April the 1st, the entire Corps went on an

05:00.063 --> 05:07.174
extended hike to the Brazos. Did you have that any 
of the years you were there? Yes, we had a hike. We

05:14.041 --> 05:16.864
had maneuvers for overnight. I believe it was we 
had overnight camp and that sort of thing. I don't

05:21.931 --> 05:32.804
recall whether we went to the Brazos or just where, 
but I do remember that we had that

05:21.931 --> 05:32.804
in our program. Was that on April 1st? I don't 
recall. We had some pictures of a hike to the Brazos

05:35.287 --> 05:41.635
and supposedly At one point, anyway, this was done 
to kind of prevent or forestall mischief on the

05:42.374 --> 05:48.788
campus on April Fool's Day. Well, I hadn't thought 
of that.

05:55.121 --> 05:58.408
I just don't recall whether it was April 1st or not. 
One of the things that's of interest to us is the

06:00.683 --> 06:14.119
number of customs or traditions which have been 
carried on campus for a long time, such things as

06:00.683 --> 06:14.119
the bonfire and the muster and silver taps. Were 
any of these in the vogue while you were there? As I

06:18.344 --> 06:29.678
recall, silver taps was because there was one or 
two deaths while I was there, and I think they used

06:31.160 --> 06:33.983
silver taps at that time. I don't recall any of the 
other. Did the entire Corps, when a boy died, if he

06:37.367 --> 06:46.859
died on campus and they carried the casket to the 
railroad station, did the whole Corps march with

06:37.367 --> 06:46.859
him? No. No, I don't believe so. One of the students 
I've talked to, former students I've talked to,

06:51.284 --> 06:55.489
indicated that they did when he was there. I see. 
Perhaps it came along after or before my time.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.062
Okay.

07:05.483 --> 07:08.227
Did you have any girls in any classes while you were 
there? No, I don't recall any girls at all in the

07:08.967 --> 07:12.992
classes. One or two of the instructors' wives were 
in some of the classes. I suppose not over a half a

07:21.582 --> 07:30.732
dozen that I recall, maybe not that many.

07:31.808 --> 07:37.955
who were in some of the classes, but no girls at all. 
Nobody who was not in some way tied to a university

07:39.077 --> 07:45.184
person or college person. That's right. We know 
that a lot of the students who went to A&M at that

07:46.746 --> 07:52.834
time had jobs of one sort or another. Did you have 
any jobs on campus while you were there? Yes.

08:00.361 --> 08:20.612
In my freshman year, I worked nights in the 
agricultural building at the creamery making ice

08:00.361 --> 08:20.612
cream and cleaning up the laboratory along with 
another student. He got the job and I got to work

08:20.692 --> 08:24.698
also. Did that kind of work? Let's see. Was that ice 
cream for the cafeteria? Or was it sold off? I don't

08:32.736 --> 08:34.198
know what they did with it. We packed it in 
10-gallon cans, I believe it was. And I think they

08:39.482 --> 08:43.566
shipped some of it, but I don't know. Perhaps they 
did use some of it there.

08:50.452 --> 08:54.195
And

08:50.452 --> 08:54.195
oh, I don't know. In my senior year I did a little 
drawing for the building and grounds department,

08:57.010 --> 09:17.860
designed a residence for the, and drew the plans 
for a residence for the Commandant's dwelling

08:57.010 --> 09:17.860
which was built after I believe, after I left 
there. And then we did all during those my

09:22.492 --> 09:52.161
sophomore junior and senior years along in there 
we made placards for for the extension service

09:22.492 --> 09:52.161
they had a train that visited around over the state 
I believe at that time and they wanted signs for the

09:22.492 --> 09:52.161
various products and the usual signs that they 
would require then we also

09:54.622 --> 09:56.584
kids in the architectural department. We 
designed

09:56.604 --> 10:05.915
class cards for class photos or club photos. I 
would say not class photos, but various club

10:05.935 --> 10:13.625
photos and made a little money that way. We got as 
high as 50 cents an hour for some of that work.

10:25.773 --> 10:31.840
The plans that you drew for the Commandant's home, 
you say they were actually used later? They were

10:32.440 --> 10:33.481
used later.

10:37.326 --> 10:39.929
Would that have been the home that Ike Ashburn? I 
don't. He was a Commandant, I believe, after that.

10:44.854 --> 10:46.816
After, a good long while after that. He was a 
Commandant after World War I, I believe. And of

10:52.267 --> 10:57.517
course, that was before World War I that I did that 
work. But the house that Ashburn lived in, and I

10:58.499 --> 11:10.663
don't know whether any other commandants lived 
in, I presume they did, we have had somebody in our

10:58.499 --> 11:10.663
faculty has come into the archives looking for 
pictures of that house because he now owns it and

11:11.015 --> 11:15.642
lives in it. Somebody bought it and moved it off 
campus. Oh, is that right? And he was interested in

11:20.269 --> 11:24.776
primarily the outward appearance of it. Well, I 
don't remember much about it. Well, we have some

11:32.210 --> 11:35.235
fairly small pictures that show it. Have you? I 
don't believe it's been altered any on the

11:36.016 --> 11:40.083
outside, or if it hasn't been altered very much. I 
might recognize it. I don't know. I wasn't very

11:42.748 --> 11:45.112
good at it those days. It's only a couple blocks off 
campus now. Is that right? I'd like to see it

11:47.836 --> 11:52.043
sometime when I'm there. I was never aware that the 
house had been designed by a student. Yes,

11:58.366 --> 12:15.871
actually, it was a frame house, just a wood frame 
house, wood siding, as I recall, and a porch on

11:58.366 --> 12:15.871
maybe two sides of the house. I don't recall. I've 
forgotten that. It was located, I believe,

12:20.498 --> 12:23.442
somewhere near Guyon Hall. I don't know. Guyon 
Hall wasn't there when I was there. It was built, I

12:27.627 --> 12:28.889
believe, in 1918. Yes. You had chapel in the old 
chapel later to be used as an armory, I believe.

12:33.996 --> 12:35.719
Yes.

12:38.643 --> 12:50.901
We finished a little bit early in 1917, before

12:38.643 --> 12:50.901
we left there in May, May the 3rd, I believe it was.

12:51.822 --> 12:56.689
So you say that your class in the class of 17 What, 
did you kind of hurry up the last semester? The

13:00.870 --> 13:17.451
class of 17, I believe as a unit, practically as a 
unit at any rate, all those who were physically

13:00.870 --> 13:17.451
able, went to a first officer's training camp at 
Leon Springs. And some of the juniors also went.

13:25.222 --> 13:28.546
For how long then did you stay in the military? Oh, I 
went through that camp and competed for regular

13:29.226 --> 13:53.693
army commission and managed to get it and was 
assigned to a regular army regiment in Arizona and

13:29.226 --> 13:53.693
was there for about a year and back to Camp Travis or 
Fort Sam Houston now, and the arms just caught us

13:54.567 --> 14:02.339
there. And I retired then, resigned my commission 
in 1919,

14:03.400 --> 14:14.557
in about May. I was in about two years, a little 
over, I guess. Okay. According to the yearbook of

14:19.781 --> 14:28.933
1917, when you graduated for the 14-15 school 
year, you had been on the ZOAVI team. Yes. Could you

14:30.335 --> 14:32.758
tell us a little bit about that organization? 
Well, you have seen on stage, in stage shows,

14:33.319 --> 14:48.039
particularly on television, fancy rifle work. 
Mm-hmm. Army, Navy, Marines. Yes, particular

14:52.381 --> 14:54.143
drill teams. Special drill teams, and that is what 
the ZOA team was. The boy named Charlie Stoner,

15:01.011 --> 15:13.224
before he came to school, had done professional 
work like that. So he organized the that team and I

15:17.558 --> 15:21.524
believe Ronstangle might have been on it. I'm not 
sure. Was it organized in 1415? Yes, yes. We made, I

15:28.794 --> 15:40.832
recall, we made

15:28.794 --> 15:40.832
trips two different years with the Glee Club and 
the

15:44.221 --> 15:48.726
to the various schools and towns around in Texas. 
And the drill team, 13 of us went along with that.

15:53.711 --> 16:00.798
There were actually about 17, I believe, in it, but 
could only use 13 on the trip. So it was a special

16:00.818 --> 16:08.486
drill team, somewhat akin, but somewhat smaller, 
a good bit smaller than the Ross Volunteers. Oh,

16:08.706 --> 16:09.186
yes. The Ross Volunteers was just straight 
company drill team. For instance, they marched at

16:17.355 --> 16:24.102
quick time, 120 per minute, I believe. We drilled 
at a much faster pace than that, and of course,

16:25.283 --> 16:41.159
there was some, I guess you'd call it a little bit of 
athletics along with it, special handling of the

16:25.283 --> 16:41.159
guns and so on. Did that require a good bit of 
practice? Yes, it did. It required an awful lot of

16:44.600 --> 16:47.584
practice. This would have been, well, although 
the fish drill team is a larger unit. We didn't have

16:53.391 --> 16:55.354
a fish drill team. No, at that time. Was the Zouave 
team composed of people from all classes? I

17:03.164 --> 17:11.434
believe so, except no seniors, as I recall. And no 
freshmen. So it would be primarily only

17:13.259 --> 17:15.341
sophomores and juniors. Sophomores and juniors. 
Do you have any idea how long that organization

17:16.643 --> 17:19.065
lasted? I believe only as long as Charlie Stoner 
was there. He was a 16-man. He was one of my original

17:28.015 --> 17:30.838
classmates.

17:35.323 --> 17:40.729
I recall we made two trips around over the state. 
with the team.

17:45.383 --> 17:49.589
How did you raise money for the trip or did the 
school supply you with some money? No. The school

17:53.515 --> 17:58.462
perhaps, I don't remember how we raised the money. 
I suppose the school paid part of it. At least we

18:04.210 --> 18:07.915
went by train and What kind of uniform did you have? 
We had the gray uniform. Just a regular normal

18:13.010 --> 18:15.954
cadet uniform and have a special fancy dress. No 
special uniform. This type of organization

18:18.038 --> 18:20.301
sometimes has. No, this was just a straight gray 
uniform. I know there were a number of Civil War

18:24.147 --> 18:29.315
units with that particular title that had very 
fancy uniforms. Yes, I know. I recall. And one year

18:32.178 --> 18:35.863
you were circulation manager of the battalion. 
Right. My roommate was business manager. What did

18:40.449 --> 18:43.133
being circulation manager involve?

18:45.857 --> 18:58.033
Rolling the papers in pre-addressed

18:45.857 --> 18:58.033
papers

18:59.853 --> 19:01.494
getting them ready to mail out. This would be to 
out-of-town subscribers? Yes, yes. Would this

19:04.818 --> 19:07.920
be, what, former students who were subscribing to 
the battalion? Yes, former students who were

19:08.701 --> 19:14.146
subscribing to other schools. Did you mail it to 
the advertisers? The students would subscribe

19:19.291 --> 19:29.640
for their girlfriend, for instance, or their 
parents,

19:30.987 --> 19:31.949
Someone like that. But as far as the students were 
concerned, they just picked it up at a location

19:32.550 --> 19:36.720
somewhere on campus? I don't recall about that. I 
think they were just distributed by companies,

19:39.105 --> 19:44.497
perhaps. Today, they put a pile in the library and a 
pile here and a pile there, and the students go by

19:44.537 --> 19:48.987
and pick them up. Is that right? I don't know. 
Generally, they also deliver them through the

19:51.254 --> 19:54.399
whole city of College Station. I don't know 
whether there was really any city of College

19:54.479 --> 19:58.706
Station when you were there. No, there were very 
few people there, just the professors.

20:07.481 --> 20:15.133
Then after you graduated, you went into the 
service for a while, and in 1919 you resigned your

20:07.481 --> 20:15.133
commission in the service. What did you do then? I 
went back to Clarendon, Texas, and went into the

20:16.297 --> 20:24.629
hardware and furniture business with my father 
and older brother. Was that H.C. or K.C.? H.C. H.C.

20:30.558 --> 20:34.944
I believe the former student's directory had it as 
K.C., Kerbo and Sons. No, H.C. So it was H.C., Kerbo

20:36.306 --> 20:37.969
and Sons. And what was, that was, did you say 
furniture? Hardware and furniture. Hardware and

20:42.155 --> 20:42.996
furniture. And I was in there. My father passed 
away in 1930, and my brother and I continued

20:45.049 --> 20:58.361
the business until 1936, when the Depression 
finally got us.

21:01.323 --> 21:04.987
Then I went to work for the Department of 
Agriculture. At that point, did you just close out

21:05.247 --> 21:07.449
the business? No, we went into bankruptcy. Went 
into bankruptcy. So you went to the department?

21:15.121 --> 21:16.663
Involuntary bankruptcy. Then you went to the 
Department of Agriculture as a draftsman? I got a

21:21.088 --> 21:41.451
job with the Department of Agriculture in 
Amarillo as a draftsman and then went from there as

21:21.088 --> 21:41.451
a junior architect and then as a field engineer and 
then as a regional architect Dallas later on.

21:44.904 --> 21:49.311
During that time, I was in Amarillo and San Antonio 
and Dallas. And I was in Dallas when the

21:50.393 --> 21:59.207
opportunity came to come to the Veterans 
Administration in 46. And I took that... Do you

22:01.010 --> 22:06.358
have any... favorite buildings that you designed 
when you were with the Department of Agriculture,

22:06.862 --> 22:12.450
or did you do any designing? Oh, I did some 
designing. It was residential buildings, small

22:14.492 --> 22:28.511
residences, farm residences, and

22:14.492 --> 22:28.511
dairy barns,

22:14.492 --> 22:28.511
storm cellars. So what would you do then? Draw a set 
of plans which they would reproduce and

22:31.668 --> 22:35.112
distribute to farmers? Yes, it would become a 
standard plan then and they would send it out to the

22:35.132 --> 22:52.714
various counties as they needed

22:35.132 --> 22:52.714
and the writing of specifications of course and so 
on. So then you came to Lubbock at the Veterans

22:53.926 --> 22:58.610
Administration in 46. In 46, in the latter part of 
46, as Assistant Chief Appraiser. In 47, I became

23:06.938 --> 23:11.522
Chief Appraiser. What was your responsibility 
then? Well, we had 79 counties of the western

23:15.866 --> 23:23.933
counties of the state

23:25.398 --> 23:52.536
we

23:25.398 --> 23:52.536
did devalue our supervised evaluation and the 
construction of VA housing in those counties of

23:25.398 --> 23:52.536
course not personally and but through uh through 
uh designated inspectors and appraisers in the

23:25.398 --> 23:52.536
various counties like in El Paso and in Amarillo 
Would this be if a veteran wanted to borrow money to

23:52.820 --> 24:00.049
buy a house, then your office would appraise, you 
would have someone who would appraise the... Yes,

24:00.390 --> 24:13.947
for instance, some company would submit an 
application for

24:00.390 --> 24:13.947
appraisal of a house in El Paso. We would send it to, 
say, Jay Weems in El Paso. he would send his

24:19.533 --> 24:29.126
appraisal in, we would review it and issue a

24:19.533 --> 24:29.126
evaluation on it. And then if it had to be built, 
while we had inspectors in El Paso, we would

24:30.307 --> 24:40.681
designate him to do the inspecting during the 
construction. And I was with that until 1965, a

24:48.862 --> 25:00.420
short time before the, well, on my 70th birthday, 
well, I had to retire, of course, mandatory

24:48.862 --> 25:00.420
retirement. And since then, you've been a 
self-employed appraiser? Since then, I've had

25:03.064 --> 25:07.150
more fun appraising than I ever had before. I work 
kind of when I want to, and I try not to do too much,

25:07.330 --> 25:15.663
but enough to stay busy. Uh-huh. It gives you a good 
bit more freedom than you've had in the past. Oh,

25:22.065 --> 25:36.804
yes, I work when I want to, and I punch no clocks, and 
if I don't want an assignment, if someone wants an

25:22.065 --> 25:36.804
appraisal made and I don't want to do it, it's easy 
to... Do you work only in Lubbock, or do you go

25:22.065 --> 25:36.804
outside of Lubbock? Oh, surrounding towns on 
occasion, but most practically all together in

25:37.224 --> 25:46.136
Lubbock and practically all together in 
residential work. All residential housing...

25:47.772 --> 25:53.657
This would be, you would be working as an appraiser 
for a bank contemplating loaning money to buy a

25:47.772 --> 25:53.657
house or? Not as an employee of that bank. No, I mean 
you're consulting appraisers. Right, I'm an

25:58.922 --> 26:16.598
independent appraiser in other words, and I do 
appraisal work for, not only for the savings loans

25:58.922 --> 26:16.598
and banks and so on, locally,

25:58.922 --> 26:16.598
but...

26:19.700 --> 26:30.856
There is a company in Wisconsin who reinsures or 
insures a portion of local loans. Occasionally

26:32.639 --> 26:39.909
they want a spot check made to see that those things 
are in line, and I do work for them. Also, companies

26:39.949 --> 26:46.939
like Texas Instrument Eastman Kodak and so on want 
to move an employee, they assist him and

26:47.712 --> 27:00.690
I do appraisals for them to establish market 
value. They then in turn buy his house? They handle

27:04.935 --> 27:08.320
the deal for him.

27:18.914 --> 27:22.922
Do you have any other activities in which you 
participate? No, I really don't. Have you become

27:27.211 --> 27:30.257
involved in Lubbock politics or anything like 
that? Oh, no, no. I have my druthers, of course,

27:31.881 --> 27:39.336
about politics, but I don't take no active 
interest in it.
