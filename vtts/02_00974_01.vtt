00:11.725 --> 00:35.077
Okay,

00:11.725 --> 00:35.077
in

00:11.725 --> 00:35.077
the interest of humility and knowledge, I'm 
asking you to donate this tape to me or to the Texas

00:11.725 --> 00:35.077
A&M oral history collection in the University 
Archives. Is this okay with you?

00:40.025 --> 00:44.830
The topic is going to be the 1960s counterculture 
and the social movements at Colorado State

00:40.025 --> 00:44.830
University. Please briefly describe your 
education and your upbringing. Well, I was raised

00:51.478 --> 01:01.669
Protestant fundamentalist in Colorado.

01:01.689 --> 01:05.273
Attended school, mostly in religious school. Got 
my bachelor's degree from Southern Nazarene

01:07.025 --> 01:11.472
University.

01:14.096 --> 01:16.620
And after that, I spent some time in the Army. And 
after that, went back to school and got my master's

01:17.902 --> 01:26.094
at Colorado College and my PhD at the University of 
Illinois.

01:29.760 --> 01:29.860
Okay.

01:40.943 --> 01:49.631
I didn't really plan to do anything with it 
vocationally until I got back out of the Army and

01:40.943 --> 01:49.631
then discovered I could get a PhD. And if I did that, 
I could teach at the college level. And so that made

01:54.356 --> 01:59.681
it possible for the first time to make a living 
doing philosophy. What was so interesting about

02:00.822 --> 02:04.445
philosophy to you? Oh, I think the traditional 
things that interest people in philosophy.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.281
meaning of life? Why are we here? Those are the 
kinds of questions that got me interested in

02:14.864 --> 02:18.790
philosophy. Okay. Which, of course, are the 
questions philosophy cannot answer, but I didn't

02:18.930 --> 02:23.317
know that then. Right. When and where did you teach 
during the 1960s?

02:33.813 --> 02:35.335
Well, 1956 to 50,

02:40.107 --> 02:42.211
I went from 57 to 67. I taught at Colorado State 
University. And then from 67 on here at Texas A&M.

02:52.168 --> 02:54.112
What influenced your decisions to become a 
teacher?

02:58.460 --> 03:03.128
I think I always like to share ideas.

03:10.583 --> 03:18.636
But what I got and I came to like about it was the fact 
that you can see people share these ideas and

03:10.583 --> 03:18.636
appreciate these ideas. I guess what motivates 
you to teach is the fact that some people seem to

03:20.018 --> 03:26.108
learn something.

03:31.837 --> 03:35.663
Okay, this is where we get to the good stuff. What 
was the attitude and the spirit of the students

03:35.812 --> 03:45.002
when you began teaching, and did you witness a 
change as the decade of the 60s progressed? Yeah,

03:45.022 --> 03:46.224
in the late 50s. That's when I was a student and when 
I first started teaching. This was a very fearful

03:51.089 --> 03:52.811
period. This is a period of McCarthyism, and I 
think people today don't really understand how

03:54.413 --> 04:05.025
strong that influence was. because even as late as 
57 at Colorado College, which was a private

04:05.883 --> 04:17.213
school, there was a McCarthy Club, students and 
faculty. And it was well known that they monitored

04:18.575 --> 04:24.840
the teaching and the comments of other people. And 
this was also the period of loyalty oaths, that in

04:26.102 --> 04:33.088
order to get a teaching job, you had

04:36.815 --> 04:39.498
in the Constitution of the United States. So it was 
a period in the late 50s when people were so afraid

04:40.559 --> 04:55.455
of communism that this allowed people like 
McCarthy and others to dominate the intellectual

04:40.559 --> 04:55.455
life of this country. And people literally would 
not say or publish certain things because they

04:56.597 --> 05:03.885
were afraid they might get investigated. And it 
wasn't just being communist. If you were a member

05:06.717 --> 05:15.339
of the American Civil Liberties Union, it was 
something considered to be beyond the pale.

05:16.542 --> 05:21.013
During that period of time, an attitude which 
George Bush has revived.

05:41.648 --> 05:45.494
It was anti-paternalism was really how it started 
out. These kids didn't like what their parents

05:45.514 --> 05:49.379
were doing. They didn't like the way their parents 
lived. They didn't like their parents' focus on

05:51.262 --> 05:54.968
making money. They thought there should be 
something more important in life than fighting

05:56.450 --> 06:01.918
communism and making money. They didn't know what 
it was, and so what they turned to was,

06:11.062 --> 06:24.260
folk music, drugs,

06:11.062 --> 06:24.260
turning off, Tim Leary said, turning off, turning 
on, doing your own thing. Community living was big

06:24.581 --> 06:26.283
then. Groups of students would live together in 
old houses and share their food, share their

06:27.425 --> 06:34.875
belongings.

06:40.070 --> 06:50.003
out with some new values, knowing that the old 
values were bad, but they had no clear idea

06:40.070 --> 06:50.003
whatsoever what they were going to replace the old 
values with. They were anti-system,

06:50.524 --> 06:53.909
anti-establishment. They knew that was bad. They 
didn't know what was good. They didn't know how to

06:55.952 --> 06:58.715
replace it. That, I think, characterized the 60s.

07:03.302 --> 07:08.068
Now, some people took political advantage of 
this, and there were some movements organized And

07:09.466 --> 07:18.314
I think the leaders of these movements, like the 
Students for Democratic Society, maybe they had a

07:09.466 --> 07:18.314
particular agenda. But I think most of the people 
that followed these various movements were

07:18.334 --> 07:26.482
simply drifting around, looking for something 
better. Peace and love and so on. And during this

07:31.326 --> 07:38.933
period, I had the reputation on campus of being a 
conservative at Colorado State University.

07:41.427 --> 07:46.000
Because I would argue with these kids, and I would 
say, all right, now, what is it you want? Be

07:46.120 --> 07:47.063
positive. You say, this is bad. Don't you have an 
obligation?

08:11.600 --> 08:13.022
was too clear. Then, of course, also during that 
period, this all got caught up in the anti-Vietnam

08:14.163 --> 08:20.289
War, too. They were against the war in Vietnam. And 
I think that movement, that group of young people

08:25.995 --> 08:37.708
who just didn't like what was going on, they were 
there to be used and directed by any number of

08:38.093 --> 08:43.740
people. But generally, they were quickly 
disillusioned by the people who were using them

08:43.760 --> 08:51.048
and directing them. These people never went far 
enough as far as the young people were concerned.

08:57.876 --> 09:02.582
And in a way, it was sad because there was a lot of 
idealism

09:08.333 --> 09:09.715
And there wasn't any leadership. There wasn't 
anybody to direct it in any positive direction.

09:14.320 --> 09:19.486
See, and all you could tell them was something 
like, well, stay within the system. Work within

09:19.546 --> 09:20.167
it. Try to change it from within. And they would 
have no part of that. They weren't interested in

09:24.692 --> 09:30.378
doing that because they figured if you worked 
within the system, you simply got corrupted by the

09:24.692 --> 09:30.378
system. And they may have been right about that. 
But they weren't willing to destroy the system.

09:35.825 --> 09:36.265
They didn't have...

09:49.188 --> 09:50.510
really proved. Then this movement stopped 
because nobody really wanted to get shot. And so it

09:54.877 --> 10:00.966
was repressed by the government eventually. Did 
some of the classes you teach reflect your

10:01.567 --> 10:08.218
attitudes and views or the views of the 60s?

10:10.922 --> 10:16.090
No, I didn't go in for relevant classes, although I 
always taught existentialism. And a lot of these

10:16.981 --> 10:19.544
people thought they were existentialists. They 
claimed an affinity with existentialism. And I

10:24.271 --> 10:26.954
try to point out to them, well, they really weren't 
existentialists. They were just half-baked

10:26.975 --> 10:29.878
existentialists. They wanted to do their own 
thing. But existentialism always says, if you do

10:33.203 --> 10:37.729
your own thing, you must assume responsibility 
for it. They didn't want to do that. They didn't

10:39.732 --> 10:44.338
want to assume any responsibility for their 
actions, no matter what their actions were. They

10:45.128 --> 10:47.851
were parasites in a way. They wanted the freedom to 
use the society to have, you know, do drugs,

10:49.173 --> 10:58.564
dissent, rebel. But they wanted society always 
there to be to catch them if they fell or if they made

10:59.264 --> 11:03.309
a mistake. So that's why I say it was 
anti-paternalism. Most of this movement was

11:06.953 --> 11:14.562
getting even with mom and dad and yet hoping that 
mom and dad would be there to pick up the pieces if

11:15.571 --> 11:18.435
things got out of hand. You always know they'll be 
there if you need them. I think they really always

11:20.317 --> 11:22.560
counted on that, you see. And for the most part, 
that's what happened. The parents were there and

11:25.403 --> 11:28.287
picked them up. And I think most of the parents were 
supportive, ultimately supportive.

11:38.079 --> 11:42.304
So when people talked about it as being a great 
political revolution or a Sexual revolution or

11:44.123 --> 11:47.508
drug revolution. I think those were side issues. 
Those were symptoms. They would engage in certain

11:51.794 --> 11:56.260
activity, mainly because it irritated their 
parents. And what activity would they select?

11:59.324 --> 12:00.666
What will irritate your parents? I remember 
talking to a young girl I had in class. I still know

12:03.490 --> 12:04.051
her. We're still friends. But she was a very 
attractive girl, except she didn't care for her

12:05.813 --> 12:10.940
parents. She'd wear old clothes and Her hair was 
never combed and she looked dirty and so on. And I

12:16.988 --> 12:24.198
asked her one day, I said, you know, why the devil 
don't you clean up?

12:24.218 --> 12:25.420
I said, why do you dress like that? She said, well, 
because, because of my parents. And I said, why?

12:34.372 --> 12:36.175
She said, well, they always want me to be neat and 
clean. And I said, so you're not going to be neat and

12:38.158 --> 12:41.462
clean because your parents want you to be. Yeah, 
that's right. That's right. So, you know, it's a

12:43.574 --> 12:47.200
way of trying to shock her parents. But she still, 
you know, she never really left her parents. They

12:51.486 --> 12:53.009
never really left her. This was a,

12:53.750 --> 13:02.263
it was almost a bloodless revolution.

13:02.283 --> 13:11.758
I mean, and I think displaying

13:02.283 --> 13:11.758
in some ways because it never really accomplished 
a great deal.

13:15.552 --> 13:17.956
Most of what happened was bad. You got some people 
who got really hooked on bad drugs. You got some

13:22.863 --> 13:29.252
people

13:22.863 --> 13:29.252
who really lost their purpose in life, became 
drifters.

13:32.998 --> 13:35.822
Oh, some good music came out.

13:39.027 --> 13:44.715
But it was strictly a made-in-the-USA kind of 
rebellion. safely within limits and boundaries,

13:45.488 --> 13:49.176
I think, never really got out of hand. And I think 
the government overreacted

13:49.757 --> 13:55.089
by starting to shoot people. And that's why, if 
these people had been serious, they would have

13:55.149 --> 13:58.917
shot back. But they weren't. It was just kind of 
like, oh,

14:10.818 --> 14:13.222
Some of the classes you taught, were there 
guidelines? Were you able to set your own goals or

14:14.003 --> 14:20.915
guidelines for your classes, or was the 
administration really strict on what you were

14:14.003 --> 14:20.915
allowed to teach and how you were supposed to teach 
it? You know, after the 50s were over, we got rid of

14:21.857 --> 14:26.745
McCarthyism. You had a great deal of freedom in the 
classroom because during the 60s, You had

14:33.565 --> 14:37.710
teach-ins, big thing. You had a lot of professors 
using the classroom to support the students, to

14:38.731 --> 14:49.643
support various causes, all of which I thought was 
bad. I thought that was a misuse of the classroom.

14:52.846 --> 15:01.876
But you had the counterpart of that was you had, in 
many places, students taking over classrooms,

14:52.846 --> 15:01.876
trying to take over universities. And that's what 
upset me. I think that's finally what upset the

15:04.075 --> 15:11.874
academic world, was that students weren't 
playing the game anymore. We'll let you have our

15:11.975 --> 15:13.980
classroom. We'll talk about these issues. But 
when you try to run the university, no, we won't let

15:16.105 --> 15:18.912
you do that.

15:35.851 --> 15:39.495
And did you encourage them to be active and offer 
advice? Well, yes, I did. I did. It depends what you

15:41.637 --> 15:42.999
mean. Encourage them to be active. I try to keep 
from hurting themselves.

15:48.926 --> 15:52.430
I tried to get them to avoid excesses if I could. And 
in fact, one time, I can't remember the exact

15:53.150 --> 16:02.601
years, but there was a period where students were 
experimenting with LSD. They were getting it from

16:05.095 --> 16:09.862
certain varieties of morning glory seeds, which 
contained it naturally. Lysergic acid contained

16:09.882 --> 16:12.266
it naturally. But they didn't know how to use it. 
They didn't know how to get it from the morning

16:15.430 --> 16:18.335
glory seeds, how to use it. They didn't know what 
precautions to take. And this was a time where LSD

16:21.980 --> 16:25.025
was a recreational drug. It was almost like 
whiskey. I mean, professors, students were using

16:26.927 --> 16:29.491
it. People were spending the weekend. putting 
drops of LSD on sugar cubes, dripping them down,

16:33.277 --> 16:38.524
and having trips. And so you'd get some kids that, 
to use the language of that day, kids that would

16:39.966 --> 16:46.735
really freak out, I mean. And we began to learn some 
things about drugs. Learned one, that you could

16:49.679 --> 16:55.286
set the mood by setting the stage. In other words, 
if a person prepared themself, by reading certain

17:00.125 --> 17:05.612
things, talking about certain things, then they 
would have a certain kind of drug experience. But

17:07.795 --> 17:16.767
that drug experience wasn't very stable, that you 
needed to have somebody around that kept it within

17:07.795 --> 17:16.767
bounds by talking to them holding their hand and so 
on. People shouldn't use drugs on their own. We

17:20.011 --> 17:25.639
learned that because people would jump out of 
windows and kill themselves. We learned also that

17:30.517 --> 17:38.406
If people had any psychotic tendencies at all, and 
they might not be obvious on the surface, the drugs

17:30.517 --> 17:38.406
would bring it out, especially LSD would bring it 
out. And so people would just sometimes go

17:39.888 --> 17:48.057
permanently around the bend because of the LSD 
when they might have lived a normal life without

17:39.888 --> 17:48.057
using the LSD. So people fairly quickly got scared 
of LSD because of so-called bad trips. But during

17:56.026 --> 17:59.190
that period of experimentation, I remember... 
typing up and reproducing a little one-page

18:00.217 --> 18:11.589
instruction on how to use morning glory seeds so 
that the kids would not have bad trips, see? And

18:11.609 --> 18:17.054
these instructions were printed later in the 
college newspaper. You know, imagine the

18:18.376 --> 18:19.877
battalion doing this. And kids would recount 
their trips, their acid trips. They'd write them

18:25.403 --> 18:26.945
up in paper. I mean, this was all open. I mean, 
nobody was saying, this is bad stuff. People were

18:32.961 --> 18:35.326
saying, well, keep it under control. It's totally 
different from the day with the gist, they know.

18:38.611 --> 18:40.074
Oh, yeah. It really was a period of, as I say, 
experimentation. And I had kids come to class and

18:45.123 --> 18:51.594
light up a joint marijuana, and I finally made them 
stop that. I just said, no, you don't know.

19:01.540 --> 19:05.946
And so I think the students' graduate award in LSD 
was bad. And I remember having in class debates

19:06.486 --> 19:11.513
about marijuana. And you'd have some students 
say, oh, it's all right, and other students say,

19:13.375 --> 19:16.900
no, it's bad. And this was not on moral grounds at 
all. I mean, these are kids who tried it and said,

19:20.364 --> 19:26.572
you know, all the time I was on it, I didn't care 
about anything. You just don't care.

19:33.367 --> 19:35.970
You know, you don't do any harm, particularly. You 
don't go out and kill people, but you just don't

19:36.031 --> 19:39.575
care about anything. You're passing. And we have 
arguments like this. But in this pamphlet, I start

19:44.602 --> 19:55.797
to tell you about, you know, the seeds, the morning 
glory seeds, certain varieties had LSD in them, or

19:44.602 --> 19:55.797
resurgic acid in them.

20:07.167 --> 20:09.310
So first you had to wash the seeds carefully. Then 
you had to grind them up. Because some kids would

20:11.692 --> 20:17.019
take a handful of seeds, nothing would happen. 
They'd take another handful and nothing would

20:17.039 --> 20:19.101
happen. And then all of a sudden, finally, the 
seeds were being broken down by their digestive

20:19.942 --> 20:29.634
juices and they'd get hit with these massive doses 
of seed. So what you had to do was grind it up so that

20:29.654 --> 20:33.498
you'd get the effect quickly. And then the right 
amount have a friend there and, you know, do all

20:37.846 --> 20:45.677
this because it's necessary to have at least two 
people around. I thought with LSD, because you

20:45.737 --> 20:53.067
might hurt yourself just thinking you could walk 
into a mirror or all kinds of stupid things. I never

20:55.130 --> 20:58.154
used any of the drugs myself during that period. 
And, but I did try, I guess that's just,

21:10.853 --> 21:12.135
political side of it, too. You hated to see him get 
shot. You hated to see him confront the police

21:16.862 --> 21:24.654
because you knew, ultimately, what the attitude 
or authority was going to be. And these things came

21:26.597 --> 21:31.144
to a head, I think, with Kent State and the 
Democratic Convention in Chicago. Basically,

21:33.227 --> 21:38.315
the grown-ups said, this is enough. If we have to, 
we'll shoot you.

21:43.388 --> 21:50.034
Did you encourage debates in your class regarding 
student rights, women's rights, civil rights in

21:43.388 --> 21:50.034
the Vietnam War? Yeah, sure did. We talked a lot 
about student rights. And we had quite a few

21:53.457 --> 21:57.640
debates about the war. This was common during that 
period.

22:06.608 --> 22:12.433
I was generally a person, if they had a debate, I 
generally argued for who were in Vietnam. And the

22:16.014 --> 22:18.898
reason for that was is that they were all against 
it. They didn't think about the other side of the

22:20.441 --> 22:24.808
issue at all. And I think if I had been in Korean War, 
and I think if I had been of age, I would have gone to

22:24.828 --> 22:33.621
Vietnam. I would have thought that's my job.

22:38.729 --> 22:40.632
But they didn't think that way.

22:43.970 --> 22:45.592
about women's rights. Civil rights is already 
past, you know, it's getting going. Well, women's

22:48.556 --> 22:49.958
rights came very late. It's a funny thing. See, 
these people didn't care about women's rights.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.209
The kids in the 60s used women. And these communes 
that have, there's usually one woman who did all

22:58.811 --> 23:02.897
the work. She cooked all the food. She took care of 
everybody. And that's what held the thing

23:05.921 --> 23:07.263
together. And if she quit, if she got tired of doing 
this, you know, she was the earth mother figure. If

23:11.789 --> 23:13.892
she quit doing this, the thing would fall apart. 
But these kids used one. Women weren't considered

23:16.496 --> 23:19.400
to be equal in the 60s. That movement didn't have 
anything to do with women's rights. Now, it tried

23:22.543 --> 23:27.128
to latch up with the racial movement. It tried to. 
But I think most of them admitted afterward they

23:29.891 --> 23:34.577
really didn't care about that issue either. That 
was just something to do. It was a cause. See, these

23:39.042 --> 23:43.727
were people looking for something to do, 
something to give their life meaning, right? And

23:44.669 --> 23:53.419
whatever,

23:44.669 --> 23:53.419
you know, whatever they could latch up to would 
work, but women's rights was not one of the things

23:44.669 --> 23:53.419
they got up to. They got into civil rights 
movement, anti-war movement, pro-drug

23:54.500 --> 24:02.830
movement, you know, sex, pre-sex. Pre-sex was a 
big issue. And freedom of speech was a big issue,

24:06.454 --> 24:10.018
which meant, you know, Really, what that meant at 
that time was that you could say, fuck, without

24:11.213 --> 24:18.063
getting in trouble. That was the free speech 
issue. You might have said that you did some

24:20.226 --> 24:27.816
participation with your students taking the 
counter side to what they talked about. How did

24:27.916 --> 24:32.242
your administration view your participation? 
Well, I think the students thought I was a

24:32.262 --> 24:38.571
conservative, and the administration thought I 
was a communist. kind of stuck in the middle. Yeah,

24:41.162 --> 24:52.754
because as long as you were doing anything with 
this student movement, then the administration

24:41.162 --> 24:52.754
didn't like it.

24:55.176 --> 25:01.563
But the students, and some of them told me 
afterwards, they said, you know, you were the guy

24:55.176 --> 25:01.563
we had to test our ideas against.

25:04.606 --> 25:06.988
We had some ideas that we thought were really 
liberal

25:18.038 --> 25:20.640
They were just nervous. They were nervous. They 
were afraid the students were going to take over

25:22.742 --> 25:24.904
the university. They were going to be destructive 
and so on and so forth. And they didn't really

25:28.467 --> 25:30.990
understand what the root causes were. And they 
could have used this. They could have used this

25:33.832 --> 25:39.738
whole movement as a great educational 
opportunity. But they didn't. They just wanted to

25:40.398 --> 25:41.880
shut it down. How could they have used it as an 
interesting point? Well, these students weren't

25:51.063 --> 25:53.006
with these issues. Now, a lot of teachers did this, 
but they did it independent of the

25:53.026 --> 25:57.534
administration. I mean, if you said, okay, we're 
going to have a teach-in about student rise or

25:58.816 --> 26:08.333
about war, you had to do this on your own. The 
administration didn't like it particularly. And

26:12.360 --> 26:15.265
this is why, you see, this is why ultimately in

26:20.510 --> 26:30.140
It's because they thought the administration was 
beginning to say certain things cannot be done for

26:20.510 --> 26:30.140
educational purposes. This kind of discussion, 
we don't want it. So then the students got more

26:34.625 --> 26:36.927
militant. They said, well, we'll just take over 
the classroom. Or if there would be a professor who

26:40.130 --> 26:46.977
would be in his classroom and attack them, they 
might go after him. Now, I attacked them in my

26:47.598 --> 26:49.420
class.

26:54.209 --> 26:56.453
to be fearful objects at all. I just thought they 
were misguided. There was a lot of good stuff. I

27:01.260 --> 27:03.204
mean, there was a lot of this youthful idealism. 
But we never took advantage of it, you see. And it

27:05.868 --> 27:10.055
was Kennedy saw something here, you see. Kennedy 
tried to channel it with the Peace Corps, you see.

27:16.225 --> 27:18.208
And that helped some. and helped siphon off some of 
it, the constructive part of it, you see. More of

27:22.784 --> 27:27.472
that should have been done.

27:27.492 --> 27:29.675
But of course, you see, Kennedy didn't last long 
enough. And this was disillusioning. I think if

27:32.680 --> 27:44.078
Kennedy had remained president and been elected 
for second term, as I think he would have been, I

27:32.680 --> 27:44.078
think maybe all of this energy would have been 
channeled off in a useful direction. But

27:45.290 --> 27:47.093
Kennedy's shot, so what do you think? Why did they 
shoot him? Well, they shot him because he was on our

27:49.035 --> 27:53.321
side, you know. And then who comes in? A guy who just 
loved to antagonize the students.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.778
And Dixon says, they did when I do this. They did.

28:09.765 --> 28:11.888
Were you pressured to publish? And what kind of 
materials did you publish in the 60s?

28:18.078 --> 28:19.261
more than anybody else was. I mean, in the academic 
world, if you want to get ahead, you have to . So

28:23.610 --> 28:24.753
everybody's pressured. But there wasn't any 
particular new or novel kind of pressure in the

28:24.993 --> 28:28.601
60s. Nor was there any pressure to do anything in 
any particular way or direction.

28:49.297 --> 28:50.098
It was unusual. Mostly it was just philosophical 
stuff, kind of independent of that

28:51.160 --> 28:58.632
era. So much is made of the drug culture in the 
1960s, and you've already stated that you

29:00.114 --> 29:04.922
witnessed a lot of this. Do you agree with the 
assumptions that it increased and expanded the

29:06.504 --> 29:13.195
power of the mind with the use of drugs?

29:24.818 --> 29:34.689
I mean, to say that these drugs were consciousness 
expanding is certain and true because people

29:24.818 --> 29:34.689
would have experiences and see things that you 
normally don't see, okay? I remember one student

29:35.630 --> 29:38.674
coming into my office one day and he was all bloody. 
Scratched up, clothed and torn and big smile on his

29:40.596 --> 29:46.383
face and I said, what have you been doing? He said, I 
had a wonderful trip. He said, I took this LSD He

29:53.624 --> 30:04.920
said, it came to me that if I could walk to the top of 
Horsetooth Mountain, that was a mountain near the

29:53.624 --> 30:04.920
university, that's probably 15 miles to the top 
from the university. He said, if I could walk to the

30:04.940 --> 30:14.473
top of that mountain in a straight line, without 
stopping for anything, he said, the second coming

30:04.940 --> 30:14.473
would occur. He said, I knew that.

30:21.620 --> 30:22.041
line. He never made it to the top, but he got to the 
point where he was exhausted and fell asleep. Then

30:29.351 --> 30:31.314
he came back down. He was sober now. He's over his 
drug experience. He really believed that. Well,

30:38.324 --> 30:41.108
that's a novel kind of experience. You don't 
normally believe those kinds of things.

30:46.656 --> 30:48.218
That's why a lot of people use them.

30:52.771 --> 30:55.975
to have. I don't think so. I think generally not. 
Some of them were very benign experiences. If you

31:02.483 --> 31:10.112
properly conditioned yourself, if you read a lot 
of Buddhist stuff, then you take LSD and people

31:02.483 --> 31:10.112
tell me you had a Buddhist experience. That was 
very pleasant to see. But it didn't last any

31:13.115 --> 31:16.239
longer. The drug influence, the drug lasted. And 
there was always a possibility of doing permanent

31:18.081 --> 31:22.727
damage to your brain. So, no, I just don't think it 
was a good idea. Now, I don't agree, never have

31:28.380 --> 31:47.489
agreed, though, with the government's attitude 
that every drug from marijuana up in any amount,

31:28.380 --> 31:47.489
from the amount on the head for paying up, should 
put somebody in prison. I don't agree with that.

31:52.930 --> 31:58.176
There were a lot of people who used LSD in the 60s who 
never suffered any harmful effects. They used it,

31:58.237 --> 32:01.400
they tried it, they quit it.

32:02.922 --> 32:05.225
There's a lot of people still using marijuana 
today. And it seemed to me the drugs of today, the

32:07.208 --> 32:22.887
drugs of the 90s and the 80s, like cocaine and 
crack, are much more deadly, much more deadly than

32:07.208 --> 32:22.887
LSD and marijuana and things they had in those 
days.

32:25.567 --> 32:31.332
So the fact that the government cracked down and 
tried to control us hasn't accomplished

32:25.567 --> 32:31.332
anything. It hasn't done any good. And I think 
maybe we ought to try decriminalizing some of the

32:34.214 --> 32:38.178
drugs.

32:41.020 --> 32:43.322
Cocaine, no, I don't think you ought to 
decriminalize it. I think marijuana is not

32:44.503 --> 32:51.969
helpful to people, but I don't think alcohol

32:44.503 --> 32:51.969
is either. In fact, I think alcohol is more harmful 
than marijuana. And I think this is something

32:57.443 --> 33:01.750
people have got to make up their own minds about. 
So, you know, to answer your question, I don't

33:03.612 --> 33:10.924
think the drugs did anybody any good. I think 
everybody ought to leave them alone. But I think

33:16.452 --> 33:18.355
that about cigarettes too.

33:27.194 --> 33:46.980
I think nowadays

33:27.194 --> 33:46.980
the drug problem is they're trying to get a state of 
euphoria out of it and a great feeling I think maybe

33:27.194 --> 33:46.980
in the 60s they used it to see if they could find 
something else in their mind or something else

33:27.194 --> 33:46.980
that they're just... Well, a lot of them did. A lot 
of people used it because they thought this would

33:47.000 --> 33:51.566
give them a meaning and purpose in life and so on. 
Yeah. But there were those who did it for the

33:52.668 --> 33:55.952
euphoria too.

34:02.598 --> 34:12.028
If you smoke anything, we know now if you smoke 
something, whether it's crack or cigarettes, it

34:02.598 --> 34:12.028
gets into the brain stream very quickly. If you 
inject it in your veins, it gets into your blood

34:14.331 --> 34:21.038
system quickly, but not as quickly as if you smoke 
it. And if you eat it, it takes longer to get into the

34:21.058 --> 34:25.763
nervous system. Now, we also know that addictions 
of drugs that you smoke are the hardest ones to

34:28.855 --> 34:35.082
overcome. The needle stuff is the second hardest, 
and ingestion by mouth is the easiest to overcome.

34:44.013 --> 34:47.196
The quicker it hits your bloodstream, the more 
addictive it becomes.

34:50.740 --> 34:56.567
Each three types of addiction require different 
treatment, and each three types of addiction are

34:57.509 --> 35:02.756
types of addiction adopted by people with 
different personalities. I think in the 60s, you

35:02.776 --> 35:12.409
had a lot of...

35:02.776 --> 35:12.409
What's the drug you make cookies out of? Hashish is 
one. You had a lot of people eating drugs in the 60s

35:15.212 --> 35:22.382
and swallowing drugs by mouth. And most of those 
people could quit. I did quit while I did quit. Now,

35:29.222 --> 35:32.466
where was the crack? And the reason it's being 
marketed is just for money. The people who supply

35:36.290 --> 35:39.374
drugs developed crack. They sat down and planned 
this. Crack, oh boy, this will get them quick. And

35:43.158 --> 35:44.059
this will hook them forever. And you smoke it, 
especially. And you've got them. So that's a whole

35:50.587 --> 35:52.789
different approach to drugs. And The government 
attempts to take care of the drug problem. We're

36:02.073 --> 36:06.838
not affecting the 60s, and they're not affecting 
them. I'm not sure what the answer is. With people

36:09.220 --> 36:13.605
with crack cocaine, I don't know what the answer 
is. We may have to adopt the Chinese answer.

36:19.872 --> 36:22.355
They gave them six months to get off, and then they 
shot them. That's right.

36:26.305 --> 36:33.514
I hate to advocate that, but I don't know that there 
is a cure.

36:33.534 --> 36:36.498
And it's a terribly hard addiction to overcome, I 
understand.

36:39.782 --> 36:42.906
But to blame all that on the 60s is ridiculous. 
Yeah.

36:46.971 --> 36:49.514
The 1960s was a time of tremendous change. Were 
these changes... Did you witness these changes on

36:52.073 --> 36:59.102
your campus and do you believe they were 
inevitable? Well, we saw changes. Let's just talk

37:01.605 --> 37:07.572
about the so-called sexual revolution.

37:07.592 --> 37:18.486
What happened in the 60s was that people of college 
age began sleeping with each other without the

37:07.592 --> 37:18.486
benefit of matrimony.

37:19.968 --> 37:22.192
Much to the consternation of their parents. And 
the school authorities, for the most part. And

37:27.161 --> 37:28.282
that was a change. I don't think it was inevitable.

37:33.271 --> 37:38.140
I think the rebellion against parents was 
probably inevitable. The 50s were so darn

37:38.180 --> 37:40.103
repressive. that the kids had to rebel at some 
point. Now, what form that rebellion took, I guess

37:43.595 --> 37:50.064
maybe it had to be a sexual form of some kind. Maybe 
it had to be a drug. I don't think so. I think that

37:53.549 --> 37:56.052
rebellion could have taken other forms. But it's

37:57.374 --> 38:05.685
just hard for me to think that

38:08.821 --> 38:11.464
But that had to happen in any sense of 
inevitability. I don't think so. I think if

38:13.346 --> 38:22.114
parents had been a little smarter, if the 
government had been a little smarter, we wouldn't

38:13.346 --> 38:22.114
be sitting here talking about the 60s today.

38:29.462 --> 38:32.044
Colorado has like a reputation of having three 
spirits. DC, Boulder, and Colorado State. Was

38:36.293 --> 38:39.156
this evident in the 60s and just continued on until 
today? Well, I didn't know it at the time, but yes,

38:39.316 --> 38:57.736
you look back and you have to say that Colorado 
State and Boulder were one of the wilder places in

38:39.316 --> 38:57.736
the university scene, because we didn't know that 
then, like the students knew it then. It just

38:57.836 --> 38:58.997
turned out that way. And I've often wondered why 
that's the case.

39:08.373 --> 39:09.635
of states. So you had a kind of cross-section of 
America. I mean, they weren't just Colorado kids.

39:14.321 --> 39:15.583
There aren't that many Colorado kids. You're kind 
of in a backwater. You're in the middle of the

39:21.771 --> 39:27.999
nation and you're not strongly influenced by what 
goes on on either coast. So you're kind of free.

39:30.082 --> 39:32.265
Free from scrutiny. Free to develop on your own. 
And so nobody was...

39:41.212 --> 39:46.818
When they weren't doing the things that they were 
doing in Columbia, they were burning buildings

39:41.212 --> 39:46.818
around it. Oh, they did burn one building in CSU. I 
think it was an ROTC building. But they weren't

39:52.324 --> 39:56.369
being destructive in the same way. But also, being 
in Colorado, there's greater toleration of

39:58.451 --> 40:06.660
individualism. Now, you compare that with Texas 
A&M. See, I came down to Texas A&M in 67, and I

40:09.798 --> 40:14.764
thought the 60s were practically over. Well, we 
got a little bit of the 60s here, but we got it in the

40:15.465 --> 40:20.071
late 60s and early 70s. I mean, we had three people 
join the SDS here, and we had some marijuana in the

40:21.312 --> 40:31.165
dorms, and we had some drugs, and we had a little 
unrest. Maybe we had one demonstration against

40:31.885 --> 40:36.371
Vietnam, but it was so mild. I mean...

40:42.468 --> 40:50.541
Texas A&M was in the backwater too, but because it 
was in the cultural backwater, it wasn't

40:42.468 --> 40:50.541
influenced by these things. But Colorado was 
influenced because most of the students here were

40:51.463 --> 40:58.635
from Texas, but most of the students there were 
from all over the country. So they brought in these

40:58.655 --> 41:03.543
ideas from all over the country and mixed them up 
there. Then you had some people who didn't know

41:04.445 --> 41:07.750
what to do about it. I guess it did turn out to be an 
interesting place. Now, Colorado College could

41:11.913 --> 41:14.676
turn repressive. I taught there one year, and what 
they did at Colorado College is that they expelled

41:15.937 --> 41:22.624
any student found using drugs. Well, at Colorado 
State, we thought that was terrible. Because, as I

41:27.910 --> 41:32.535
said, there's still people using drugs for 
writing about it in the school newspaper. It was

41:34.196 --> 41:36.859
just like, you know, I'm trying this new idea, you 
know.

41:41.648 --> 41:46.553
I don't know why it was that permissive then, 
compared to other places.

41:49.416 --> 41:57.704
When you came to Texas A&M in 1967, was it, I can't 
remember when the court was forced to allow it. 64.

41:58.065 --> 41:58.665
64. Yeah, this is a few years afterward. But still, 
most of the students here were male in the court

42:00.787 --> 42:05.292
when I came. And you said you witnessed one, or knew 
of one, demonstration against Vietnam. Mm-hmm.

42:11.517 --> 42:13.199
What was the Corps' reaction to that? Well, the 
Corps all gathered around these five or six people

42:13.999 --> 42:20.565
who were demonstrating and had to be, who had to be 
protected by the campus police. Happened right

42:21.726 --> 42:28.452
out here in front of Sully Ross, the academic 
building.

42:28.472 --> 42:34.458
But the campus police just gathered around and let 
these five or six kids demonstrate for 20 minutes,

42:28.472 --> 42:34.458
and then that was it. This is the way to handle it, I 
think. I mean, that's all there were, five or six

42:39.277 --> 42:42.622
kids, and most of them were from somewhere else, I 
think. There just wasn't any strong anti-war

42:44.906 --> 42:52.697
sentiment here, or hippie element here. Plowed 
children,

42:52.717 --> 42:57.044
no, not at A&M, no. Did you ever go to visit other 
campuses like Berkeley or Columbia during the

42:57.064 --> 43:04.435
60s? What did you visit there?

43:11.980 --> 43:13.081
They were pretty wild, too. I'd go give talks at the 
California universities during that period. And

43:19.648 --> 43:28.817
the students would come into the building, and 
they would be dressed or undressed in all kinds of

43:19.648 --> 43:28.817
weird ways. That was one characteristic. And they 
would sit in the windows or on the floors, and

43:31.100 --> 43:35.464
they'd have their guitars with them. And it was 
kind of like, you know, we're going to have a nanny.

43:41.123 --> 43:47.129
And you either talk their language and 
communicate with them fairly quickly or you lost

43:41.123 --> 43:47.129
them. It was all superficially very free and easy. 
Superficially, that way. But these kids weren't

43:55.797 --> 43:57.638
free and easy inside. That was the sad part. They 
were looking for something and never did find it. A

44:03.143 --> 44:05.225
lot of movies have been made about this. Like The 
Big Chill. I don't know what, you know, about how

44:08.883 --> 44:12.286
people reflecting back on their experience. I 
think they're quite right when they reflect back

44:12.306 --> 44:23.718
and say, you know, what turns out to be finally nice 
about it is that we were close together and we felt

44:12.306 --> 44:23.718
friendly toward each other. The communal 
experience was about the only thing that lasted.

44:27.461 --> 44:28.222
Made some friends. They all had to get jobs 
sometimes and they had to become part of the

44:30.684 --> 44:34.468
system. And most of them did a very good job at it. 
You know, it's interesting. Look at

44:38.820 --> 44:43.686
Tom Hayden. And who else was I thinking

44:43.706 --> 44:49.754
of? Well, Hayden's a good example of a radical...

45:04.790 --> 45:06.972
Mark Lee was in philosophy. Angela Davis was a 
woman who taught philosophy. A lot of these

45:10.276 --> 45:20.928
so-called radicals, leaders, were from 
philosophy, which is what you'd expect,

45:10.276 --> 45:20.928
actually, to think about these things. But the 
people that followed them, as I said, didn't

45:20.948 --> 45:25.292
really. Outside of being friends and having a 
warm, friendly experience, You know, it didn't

45:32.127 --> 45:38.334
make a permanent effect on this country at all.

45:38.354 --> 45:39.175
I could be wrong. I mean, in a sense, some things 
happen. We can't go back. We can't go back to the 50s

45:44.562 --> 45:48.566
again. That's one good thing the 60s did for us. We 
can't go back to McCarthy again. I don't think. But

45:54.594 --> 45:55.455
see, I don't know. I see people who want to.

46:00.663 --> 46:05.171
and Jesse Helms and so on remind me of McCarthy a 
great deal.

46:07.975 --> 46:12.263
But they're not enforcing loyalty and they're not 
punishing people yet. And I hope that doesn't

46:12.283 --> 46:15.188
happen again. So maybe the

46:28.237 --> 46:49.519
This concludes the

46:28.237 --> 46:49.519
interview with Dr. Manuel Davenport.
