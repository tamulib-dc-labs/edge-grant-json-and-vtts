Will Davis, for example, strong advocate of 
community in Austin. Will's going to run again.

00:08.877 --> 00:10.060
He'll probably get elected. If we get enough 
people like Will Davis on there, and one thing I

00:10.602 --> 00:16.639
think is probably, going to help us is this whole 
area of at-risk use dropout prevention the

00:17.294 --> 00:40.433
latchkey child the whole thing of drug and sex 
education the the terminal of alternative

00:17.294 --> 00:40.433
schools fits in very nicely for community ed to be a 
delivery system for part or all of some of these new

00:17.294 --> 00:40.433
mandated required programs i think if we can if we 
can convince these legislators that community

00:40.413 --> 00:58.541
education is the logical delivery system of a lot 
of these support programs that are now mandated by

00:40.413 --> 00:58.541
law for local school districts to implement, I 
think that's going to be our key to the next big wave

00:40.413 --> 00:58.541
of new projects in community education. It's 
going to be a heavy involvement and integration of

01:00.258 --> 01:16.816
the K-12 program and some of those sustaining 
programs that deal with the real critical issues

01:00.258 --> 01:16.816
of dropout prevention, the latch key thing, the 
tutorials, the drug abuse, the teenage

01:00.258 --> 01:16.816
pregnancies. I think community education is just 
a natural extension of the school day that can

01:17.236 --> 01:26.907
provide the programs and services needed to if not 
prevent at least turn around or make more people

01:26.887 --> 01:45.616
aware of the alternatives that hopefully will 
slow and eventually stop the tremendous numbers

01:26.887 --> 01:45.616
that we're losing to dropouts, to the pregnancy 
things, to people addicted to drugs and the whole

01:26.887 --> 01:45.616
cycle. The Secretary of State in a meeting 
yesterday mentioned the fact that we're not

01:45.656 --> 01:52.506
getting enough of the federal funds that are out 
there, that Texas is really way down. on the scale

01:52.908 --> 01:55.191
of federal funds. Are there not a lot of federal 
funds available for these kinds of things that

01:55.552 --> 02:03.223
community ed, for example, could? I know they're 
already getting some. I've heard of some

02:05.146 --> 02:12.417
recently, like these programs for single parent 
and so forth. Are they encouraged or directors

02:13.759 --> 02:19.067
encouraged to actively pursue those? That's 
probably going to be an alternative source of

02:19.688 --> 02:32.061
funding that once the need is really adequately 
addressed by local school districts and the state

02:19.688 --> 02:32.061
puts primary responsibility of the local 
district to pick up and fund these and at the same

02:32.800 --> 02:59.989
time these local school districts know the 
availability of selected federal funds to offset

02:32.800 --> 02:59.989
some of the cost to the local school district I 
think we're going to see a much higher level of

02:32.800 --> 02:59.989
activity by local school districts writing for 
and receiving these federal grants and in part of

02:32.800 --> 02:59.989
the administrative costs to administer these 
programs will also serve a dual purpose of writing

02:59.969 --> 03:03.858
of covering some of the administrative costs of 
the community education programs. So I think that

03:04.700 --> 03:06.063
is something positive. And I think in the future 
those funds are only going to increase with the

03:06.303 --> 03:10.693
federal government. I think we'll see a new wave of 
support for education with the new presidential

03:20.337 --> 03:24.767
platform and policies of the next administration 
for the next four to eight years. I think education

03:24.787 --> 03:26.731
is going to be on the forefront. I think a result of 
that is going to be a lot more federal dollars again

03:26.771 --> 03:34.127
flowing to local states and the local school 
districts. Unlike the Reagan years when he tried

03:34.428 --> 03:40.000
to turn it over to the local states, most states And 
I think the new wave of federal government is going

03:42.595 --> 03:54.747
to be to, in selected areas, increase the funding 
and assist local states and school districts to

03:42.595 --> 03:54.747
provide services to kids. Okay. All right. 
Anything in closing that you would like to wrap up

03:56.809 --> 03:59.832
with? You've given me a lot of very, very good 
insights, and I appreciate it. Any anecdote or

04:04.057 --> 04:07.180
anything that you would like to wrap this? No, I 
just think probably the legislature...

04:15.113 --> 04:34.489
for the morale of the university faculties by the 
generous raises that were afforded faculties at

04:15.113 --> 04:34.489
state universities and colleges that just kind of 
made a, recommitted the legislature,

04:15.113 --> 04:34.489
recommitted itself to quality education and the 
importance of higher education. And it was

04:34.874 --> 04:46.685
demonstrated not only verbally but financially 
to university professors to the extent of 10, 11%

04:34.874 --> 04:46.685
increase this year with the promise of another 10, 
11% of growth next year. And when faculty members

04:47.066 --> 04:58.777
feel that they're not only appreciated but are 
financially rewarded for their services, it just

04:47.066 --> 04:58.777
tends to bring the best out of the faculty. And they 
tend to work more tireless toward the end of

04:58.957 --> 05:04.442
providing quality education. And I think that 
probably single act over the last 12 months will

05:04.422 --> 05:19.815
carry us well into the 1990s as far as showing 
intent. to support a high quality education by

05:20.335 --> 05:39.272
maintaining the highest quality faculty that 
money can buy and then rewarding that faculty once

05:20.335 --> 05:39.272
they have demonstrated quality service by giving 
them adequate financial rewards so they don't

05:20.335 --> 05:39.272
have to seek those financial rewards in the 
private sector. Very good. Dr. Stark, I thank you

05:40.753 --> 05:48.360
very, very much and I hope you let me come back and 
ask you questions as this develops and I try to

05:40.753 --> 05:48.360
analyze all of the data. Thank you and thank you for 
being here.
