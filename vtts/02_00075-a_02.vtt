WEBVTT

00:04.655 --> 00:11.845
One of the first games back home was University of Houston, and it was down at the old stadium that they used to have.

00:13.167 --> 00:14.989
There's a little bitty old name, Rinky Dink Stadium.

00:15.010 --> 00:17.293
In fact, the Oilers had played in it for a while, too.

00:17.833 --> 00:20.237
Right by the U of H. Yeah, kind of down there.

00:20.377 --> 00:21.338
They're back there now.

00:21.659 --> 00:23.481
Oh, okay.

00:25.845 --> 00:33.936
And I had a blind date, and my wife was the blind date of my roommate.

00:35.553 --> 00:38.577
And she didn't know anything about A&M.

00:38.597 --> 00:40.220
My wife didn't know anything about A&M at the time.

00:40.240 --> 00:46.408
But then when we got there, she had learned about the tradition of kissing after A&M scores.

00:46.949 --> 00:49.973
And she wasn't really too enthused about that.

00:50.093 --> 00:56.883
And so I found out later that the whole game she had been praying that A&M wouldn't score, and we didn't.

00:56.903 --> 00:59.447
So she didn't have to worry about that.

00:59.467 --> 01:01.189
The score was 0 to 10.

01:01.844 --> 01:05.188
And my freshman year was a miserable time talking about football games.

01:05.208 --> 01:06.289
We were one and nine.

01:06.750 --> 01:09.493
I mean, we were talking about kissing on first downs that year, you know.

01:10.514 --> 01:15.240
And we beat the University of Texas, or TU, in that game, but then we didn't because the referees didn't allow us to.

01:15.260 --> 01:28.155
That's that famous game where we intercepted their ball in the end zone, and then the University of Texas referee by the name of Curly Hayes decided we hadn't intercepted it in the end zone.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.838
What about court trips?

01:31.342 --> 01:34.887
Court trips, of course, Houston and Fort Worth and Dallas and Waco.

01:35.287 --> 01:35.928
How'd you get there?

01:36.569 --> 01:44.879
Oh, everybody just pile on their car and, you know, drive on up there and stay with somebody's family and sleep on the floor and all that other stuff.

01:44.899 --> 01:49.645
And how did Aggies in general behave out of town, on court trips?

01:50.527 --> 01:53.991
Oh, very well.

01:55.338 --> 01:56.400
I don't ever remember an incident.

01:56.440 --> 02:03.931
I remember a lot of instances where opposing fans didn't behave very well and would use any excuse to attack Aggies.

02:03.971 --> 02:12.503
And, of course, you know, you always â€“ the one major piece of advice you got on court trips was that you went in groups of one or two hundred

02:13.192 --> 02:15.916
You know, so that nobody would do that.

02:15.936 --> 02:21.323
And there were instances where eggs in uniform got beat up or something like that, depending on where you went.

02:21.363 --> 02:25.708
All right, when there was a court trip to Houston, how many people did you have at your house?

02:26.429 --> 02:27.911
Oh, shoot.

02:28.171 --> 02:29.754
Eight, nine, ten, you know.

02:30.154 --> 02:33.558
I mean, you know, most of my fish buddies would be there sleeping all over the floor.

02:33.739 --> 02:35.201
What did your mom and dad think about that?

02:35.781 --> 02:36.442
Oh, I thought it was great.

02:37.103 --> 02:37.664
I thought it was great.

02:37.824 --> 02:38.625
And how did...

02:38.842 --> 02:42.831
In general, how did Aggies behave when they were in someone else's home?

02:42.851 --> 02:46.839
Very well, very polite, you know, everything, yes ma'am, no ma'am.

02:49.184 --> 02:52.892
You know, people love to have Ags come and stay with them.

02:53.674 --> 02:57.863
And once on the Saturday night, was there much partying?

02:58.636 --> 02:59.157
Oh, yeah.

02:59.177 --> 03:02.100
I mean, of course, the big thing was whoever lived there tried to line up dates.

03:02.981 --> 03:05.303
And so you always had dates on that night.

03:05.384 --> 03:05.584
All right.

03:05.664 --> 03:06.945
Give an example.

03:07.025 --> 03:08.867
This one I've not asked anybody before.

03:09.428 --> 03:10.189
I hadn't thought about this.

03:10.970 --> 03:15.155
How did you line up dates for eight or nine Aggie buddies in Houston?

03:15.175 --> 03:16.957
Oh, I just called girlfriends that I had back home.

03:17.557 --> 03:20.621
And girls in Houston always wanted to date Aggies anyway.

03:21.221 --> 03:24.285
I mean, there was never a problem getting dates.

03:24.305 --> 03:27.208
So I'd call up some of my girlfriends back in Houston and say, hey, I've got...

03:27.796 --> 03:34.748
eight, nine, ten buds coming into town, and we're going to need dates for the football game and Saturday night and that sort of stuff.

03:35.449 --> 03:42.081
And, you know, it wouldn't be any time before, you know, we'd have all the dates that we needed.

03:42.181 --> 03:47.811
I never, ever had problems lining up dates for buddies of mine.

03:47.831 --> 03:49.834
Now, did you all have beast buckets and moose pots?

03:50.395 --> 03:51.477
Beast buckets and moose pots.

03:51.517 --> 03:52.639
No, I don't remember that.

03:52.805 --> 03:56.429
Oh, yes, I know what you're talking about.

03:56.449 --> 03:57.871
Who got stuck with the worst.

03:57.891 --> 03:59.453
Yeah, who got the dog.

04:00.133 --> 04:02.957
Yeah, what did we call that?

04:03.437 --> 04:03.817
Shoot.

04:04.739 --> 04:08.022
Well, the pig pot, some name like that.

04:08.042 --> 04:11.326
And I can't remember thinking back about that.

04:11.386 --> 04:16.652
But yes, you'd put a buck or two in there and then vote on who got the... In my case,

04:17.678 --> 04:20.621
I never was responsible for one of those.

04:20.781 --> 04:25.266
I always ended up with some pretty good girls for the guys.

04:25.286 --> 04:28.790
Now, you said that your wife, did you meet her?

04:29.150 --> 04:31.893
I met her at the University of Houston game, my fishier.

04:33.515 --> 04:36.037
And we went to eat.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.421
God, what was the name of the restaurant?

04:39.441 --> 04:42.704
Anyway, we went to one of the nicer restaurants in Houston that night to eat.

04:43.445 --> 04:46.048
And I was sitting directly across the table from her.

04:46.923 --> 04:50.708
And I said to myself, I'm going to marry her that night.

04:51.348 --> 04:53.992
She was my old lady's date.

04:54.012 --> 04:55.473
And a year later, we started dating.

04:56.875 --> 05:00.279
And we married after I graduated.

05:01.140 --> 05:02.802
And I've been married ever since.

05:02.842 --> 05:04.164
We've been married almost 34 years.

05:04.184 --> 05:04.885
How splendid.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.929
And raised two Aggies.

05:11.292 --> 05:16.018
Were there any court trips that you remember especially in the four years?

05:20.875 --> 05:22.437
Plus or minus, especially?

05:23.218 --> 05:25.120
No, I think all of them were about the same.

05:29.986 --> 05:34.111
It was always fun going to Houston because there was such a crowd that would turn out for the games.

05:36.514 --> 05:41.580
Nothing ever different happened at any one of them.

05:43.382 --> 05:44.363
It was always a special event.

05:44.383 --> 05:48.148
It was always really neat walking downtown in any of the major cities like that in Texas.

05:49.580 --> 05:57.613
and seeing the crowd there and their reaction to the Corps, which unfortunately nowadays they don't get to do as many Corps trips.

05:58.193 --> 05:59.355
And it was all positive then?

05:59.576 --> 06:00.237
It was all positive.

06:00.257 --> 06:01.218
I remember it all positive.

06:01.258 --> 06:05.605
I remember the crowds were just very pro A&M and all sorts of people turning out.

06:09.191 --> 06:15.300
Okay, then your first muster, excuse me, your first silver taps, do you remember?

06:16.310 --> 06:24.838
Yeah, of course all those memories go together, but I can remember how special it was, all the lights going out.

06:24.858 --> 06:37.851
And in those days, before we went, we had to hang blankets over our windows, because in most cases we were going to be studying after we came back anyway, so you couldn't have any lights that would show outside, so we'd hang blankets over the windows before we left.

06:39.493 --> 06:43.937
And there was such a tremendous feeling of togetherness.

06:45.419 --> 06:49.444
You know, when you walked out, everybody was, you were all united.

06:50.986 --> 06:55.212
And walking over there in total silence in front of the academic building.

06:57.015 --> 07:06.387
And I can remember being there and you're just, you're standing and you hear the slow cadence of the RV firing squad coming up.

07:07.248 --> 07:10.252
And I'd known, I mean, they told us what would happen.

07:10.292 --> 07:13.857
But I don't think I was prepared when that first volley of seven

07:14.765 --> 07:17.047
reported out of the silence.

07:19.469 --> 07:23.953
No one has ever mentioned any kind of a prank or anything.

07:23.973 --> 07:26.836
Oh, never, ever, ever, ever.

07:27.296 --> 07:32.821
Server taps is like one of the most solemn religious services you would ever want to go to.

07:34.102 --> 07:43.270
And no, nobody would ever think of that.

07:43.790 --> 07:51.522
Right, that first fall, who did you start going to for academic advice?

07:56.430 --> 07:57.172
Trying to think.

07:58.073 --> 08:00.136
We didn't really have an academic advisor.

08:02.380 --> 08:05.325
In our days, we handled most of that in the outfit.

08:05.785 --> 08:10.573
There was always an upperclassman you could go to.

08:12.477 --> 08:17.685
who could help you out with either your fish buddies or some upperclassmen in the outfit.

08:17.725 --> 08:20.749
I don't remember actually a faculty academic advisor.

08:21.190 --> 08:23.273
How'd your grades go the first semester?

08:23.713 --> 08:25.316
I DS'd my first semester.

08:26.117 --> 08:27.359
I was scared to death.

08:27.799 --> 08:28.601
I didn't have any money.

08:28.781 --> 08:29.923
I was going to school on a loan.

08:30.003 --> 08:36.532
There was a thing called a, shoot, shoot, shoot.

08:38.215 --> 08:39.096
I can't remember the name of it.

08:39.116 --> 08:39.917
It was run out of Austin.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.860
It was a college loan.

08:42.278 --> 08:46.023
And you had to maintain a good grade point ratio.

08:47.285 --> 08:49.108
And I was scared to death my freshman year.

08:49.609 --> 08:55.237
If I didn't maintain that, of losing that loan, and that was all I had to go to school on.

08:55.958 --> 08:58.481
And so I DS'd my first semester.

08:59.022 --> 08:59.843
It was overkill.

09:02.347 --> 09:06.132
And during that time, how did you communicate with mom and dad?

09:06.413 --> 09:10.699
Well, in dorm 12, there was a room downstairs.

09:11.472 --> 09:15.076
kind of an open-ended area downstairs that had a phone in it.

09:15.577 --> 09:17.159
And that was the only phone in the dorm.

09:18.541 --> 09:24.948
And you'd have to get a pass in the evening to go down to it or try to go to it, you know, when CQ ended, which was impossible because it would be a long line there.

09:24.968 --> 09:28.753
So sometime during CQ you'd try to get a pass and go down there and call home.

09:29.814 --> 09:30.575
How often did you call?

09:30.595 --> 09:36.923
Oh, not a lot.

09:38.388 --> 09:42.883
You know, once a week maybe, something like that, once every other week, something like that.

09:42.903 --> 09:43.766
I really didn't call home that much.

09:43.786 --> 09:45.171
Did you all write back and forth?

09:45.191 --> 09:46.294
Yeah, wrote back and forth.

09:48.140 --> 09:49.545
Did Mom send any cushions?

09:49.880 --> 09:50.641
By mail?

09:50.661 --> 09:58.650
Yeah, you'd get cookies every once in a while and those sorts of things, and you had to hide those because everybody else would want to get some.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.933
Where would you hide something like that?

10:01.093 --> 10:01.954
Well, you get your footlocker.

10:01.994 --> 10:03.335
That was about the most safe.

10:03.355 --> 10:06.259
The footlocker was safe because nobody went into your footlocker.

10:07.100 --> 10:10.283
We didn't have a thing like the Monster now where you can hide things in the air conditioning.

10:10.303 --> 10:11.685
We didn't have air conditioning.

10:11.665 --> 10:14.610
We didn't have air conditioning until my sophomore year.

10:15.711 --> 10:17.013
We moved out of the core area.

10:17.193 --> 10:29.032
In fact, we lived over in the brand new dorms that were in the Cebiza area my sophomore year because they were putting air conditioning into the core dorms.

10:29.532 --> 10:31.936
Interesting story, just thinking about that.

10:31.976 --> 10:38.466
Randy Mattson lived in those dorms at that time, lived right near our outfit.

10:39.458 --> 11:03.289
one day we fish were told to go drown out randy matts and of course if you if you were going down the stairs when randy was coming up or see i mean you had to blend in the wall because he was so big and so one of the fish ran in his room and randy said don't do that and he did and drown him out and and he didn't get out the door randy got ready got it and randy picked him out and we had these old metal

11:03.269 --> 11:04.591
trash cans that we use.

11:04.611 --> 11:07.195
Randy picked him up and put this thing over his head.

11:07.435 --> 11:13.083
Randy's holding him over and puts the can over his head and squeezes it around his head and then grabbed him by the legs.

11:13.183 --> 11:14.405
These dorms had balconies.

11:14.946 --> 11:20.914
And then grabbed him by the legs and held him over the balcony and then put him down and let him go.

11:21.675 --> 11:24.520
But that was, we didn't do that anymore.

11:24.540 --> 11:28.365
Have you ever known an Aggie more respectable

11:28.784 --> 11:29.445
Than Randy Mattson?

11:29.465 --> 11:30.246
Than Randy Mattson.

11:30.446 --> 11:31.587
No.

11:31.607 --> 11:31.667
No.

11:31.687 --> 11:32.208
Super guy.

11:32.668 --> 11:33.209
Super guy.

11:35.831 --> 11:36.872
Let me share an anecdote.

11:37.033 --> 11:41.838
This is for the typist as an editorial note.

11:43.199 --> 11:52.969
I was in my office on a Saturday when Randy came to visit as a prospective freshman.

11:53.506 --> 12:06.283
with John Lindsey and Randy Ayers, who was Randy's buddy from high school.

12:07.732 --> 12:18.524
I knew who Randy was because of his great athletic success in football, basketball, and particularly in track.

12:18.544 --> 12:25.893
Shelby Metcalfe was showing him around because the track team was at the conference meet in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

12:27.235 --> 12:33.722
And I didn't know, but I learned later that the previous week Randy had flown to the University of Southern California

12:34.867 --> 12:44.341
with the previous Olympic gold medalist and the track coach, and he's met when they land by O.J.

12:44.421 --> 13:02.528
Simpson and John Wayne and a, quote, friend of the track team who pulled him aside and, according to Randy, said, boy, which would you like first, wheels, bread, threads, or broads?

13:03.605 --> 13:13.039
Randy said that he had to scratch his head and try to figure out if they had any of those commodities in Pampa, Texas where he'd gone to high school.

13:13.059 --> 13:31.367
But where I'm heading with this story is that once we had chatted a little bit, without Randy being able to see me, I looked at Shelby Metcalfe and winked and asked Shelby if he had told Randy about the faculty senate vote on compulsory chapel.

13:32.866 --> 13:37.151
And Shelby kind of shook and said, well, no, I don't know what you're talking about.

13:37.171 --> 13:38.453
And Randy said, what is it?

13:38.893 --> 13:45.902
And I said, well, the faculty voted this week that all freshman athletes have to go to chapel on Wednesday morning at seven o'clock.

13:47.324 --> 13:53.271
Randy stood at attention and very seriously said, sir, if that's a rule, I'll go.

13:54.483 --> 13:58.348
And Shelby Metcalf said, I'm not bringing in more athletes to talk to you.

13:59.891 --> 14:01.232
End of note.

14:01.252 --> 14:04.657
That's a good character statement about Randy Manson.

14:05.518 --> 14:12.508
Did y'all do in any other celebrity students?

14:13.535 --> 14:19.140
No, no, that was, he was just a target of opportunity because he happened to live, we happened to live near him then.

14:20.061 --> 14:24.885
All right, so the Thanksgiving game that year was in College Station.

14:24.905 --> 14:25.846
It was in College Station.

14:26.867 --> 14:39.258
And that's the infamous game that, in fact, in my yearbook, I think it, in fact, let me look it up right now just as we're sitting here.

14:40.279 --> 14:42.681
That was the game that we were winning.

14:43.133 --> 14:46.897
until the final moments of the game, and the University of Texas was driving down.

14:48.078 --> 14:51.621
And we intercepted the ball in the end zone.

14:51.742 --> 15:02.512
And the referee, who I'm not good with names, but I'll always remember Curly Hayes, was a University of Texas graduate.

15:03.613 --> 15:08.398
And he...

15:09.408 --> 15:13.014
He said that we had not been in the end zone when we intercepted the pass.

15:13.615 --> 15:18.202
And then Texas got the ball back with like a minute left to go and won the game.

15:18.242 --> 15:21.427
And in my yearbook, it says, Aggies 13, TU 9, ref 6.

15:25.193 --> 15:30.522
And in fact, if I remember correctly, there were...

15:32.037 --> 15:39.927
There were several heart attacks in Kyle Field that night, right when that call was made.

15:42.230 --> 15:48.619
When you go home Thanksgiving, how were you feeling about A&M, being a student?

15:50.682 --> 16:00.154
I had always felt positive about A&M, and I knew what I was getting into, and the attitude never changed, and I was enthusiastic about A&M.

16:00.607 --> 16:06.517
It was depressing going back because I knew what I was getting into.

16:06.537 --> 16:20.740
But in my case, since my big brother had already graduated from Maine and was an officer in the Air Force, it was kind of a matter of pride and family reputation and everything else that I graduated.

16:20.960 --> 16:25.568
So there was never an alternative.

16:26.257 --> 16:28.900
And so I was always positive, but I loved A&M.

16:28.920 --> 16:29.621
I loved the school.

16:29.681 --> 16:30.763
I loved my fish buddies.

16:31.944 --> 16:33.185
I loved the camaraderie.

16:34.988 --> 16:47.283
And you were bragging about A&M back... Oh, yeah, and you talked to all your buddies back home about all the good things you did at A&M, and a lot of my buddies had no similar experiences, and so just couldn't quite relate.

16:49.465 --> 16:50.847
And Mom and Dad, what were they?

16:51.012 --> 16:53.435
Oh, absolutely positive about it.

16:53.795 --> 17:02.386
And, you know, and like I say, you know, when they dropped me off, it wasn't, there was no coddling, there was nothing that said, you're your boy, you know, go to A&M.

17:03.127 --> 17:07.592
Okay, so then second semester continues.

17:08.093 --> 17:09.595
Yeah, same kind of stuff.

17:10.656 --> 17:15.602
The only bad things were when you would get in the car to go back to NM.

17:16.426 --> 17:20.129
Those were kind of not good drives.

17:20.850 --> 17:27.396
I remember topping the hill, coming in from Navasota, and you start seeing the campus and the water towers and that sort of stuff.

17:28.317 --> 17:31.220
It was like Christian walking into the lion's den.

17:31.260 --> 17:32.401
You knew what was waiting for you.

17:32.441 --> 17:33.882
Now, did you have a car as a freshman?

17:34.002 --> 17:34.423
No, I did not.

17:34.463 --> 17:38.186
I didn't have a car until my junior year, so I'd ride back and forth with somebody.

17:38.346 --> 17:39.207
Did you ever hitchhike?

17:40.168 --> 17:40.749
Never hitchhike.

17:40.769 --> 17:41.529
Could always get a ride.

17:41.830 --> 17:44.492
Now, that was pretty well ended by then, wasn't it, hitchhiking?

17:45.232 --> 17:46.433
No.

17:47.074 --> 17:52.038
You would see hitchhikers at that time, and a lot of times you'd see eggs hitchhiking.

17:52.699 --> 17:57.883
That was in the early 60s, and it wasn't that bad.

17:57.903 --> 17:59.805
An anecdotal story, a little sideline.

18:00.826 --> 18:02.508
Texas was a different place in those days.

18:04.489 --> 18:15.019
I talk to people out here in New Mexico, and it's really funny that New Mexico is a fairly liberal state, but I talk about when I was a senior in high school,

18:15.640 --> 18:21.307
I'd always wanted this certain rifle, or I'd wanted it since it had come out.

18:21.387 --> 18:22.689
It was a Remington nylon 66.

18:22.829 --> 18:25.312
It was a .22 rifle that had come out in the 50s.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.156
And I'd had a job, and I bought this rifle.

18:30.058 --> 18:32.861
No, I was a freshman in high school when this happened.

18:32.881 --> 18:34.403
I was a freshman in high school, and I bought this rifle.

18:35.064 --> 18:42.353
And then my brother was in pilot training down at Moore Air Base in Mission, Texas, down in the Rio Grande Valley.

18:43.054 --> 18:43.875
And I went down to visit him.

18:44.733 --> 18:54.446
And I can remember to this day getting on the train to go down there to Harlingen, me, my suitcase, and my rifle, and sitting in the train and riding down there.

18:55.167 --> 19:06.141
And, of course, that seems in today's world, you know, but here I am a kid, 13 years old or so, me, my suitcase, and my rifle, get on the train in Texas and ride down to Harlingen.

19:06.902 --> 19:09.485
It is a different world in those days, just a totally different world.

19:11.508 --> 19:14.031
But, yeah.

19:14.872 --> 19:17.195
You didn't think anything about picking up hitchhikers.

19:17.255 --> 19:21.820
So your freshman spring was just a continuation?

19:22.621 --> 19:23.982
It was a continuation of the same.

19:24.002 --> 19:25.304
Of course, things were loosening up.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.748
And people were starting to drop handles with you.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.492
And the sophomores are getting a little bit better.

19:32.532 --> 19:40.701
And it's more of a fun, ribbing you kind of thing than the attitude of the first semester.

19:41.902 --> 19:43.444
And you're getting more privileges.

19:43.964 --> 19:48.069
You know, we got radios and those kinds of things, and we think we're on top of the world.

19:49.811 --> 19:53.135
Now, how much did you all see of the campus leadership?

19:53.535 --> 19:55.377
Did you see Mr. Rutter as a freshman much?

19:56.078 --> 19:59.182
No, even though he lived right across from us.

19:59.242 --> 20:05.849
The home had just been built about that time, and he was in the new house.

20:06.971 --> 20:12.317
I can remember in Guyon Hall one time, he'd come to speak to us.

20:12.972 --> 20:19.282
And, I mean, he was kind of a revered, you know, from our perspective, you know, this god that lived over there.

20:19.322 --> 20:20.244
You know, he was a general.

20:20.284 --> 20:21.606
He was a World War II hero.

20:21.666 --> 20:23.509
He was all that stuff.

20:23.529 --> 20:30.541
And, yeah.

20:31.102 --> 20:32.184
Who was the commandant then?

20:33.306 --> 20:33.686
Hannigan?

20:34.007 --> 20:36.651
Yeah, Hannigan was the commandant.

20:37.205 --> 20:39.189
What did you all know, you students know about him?

20:39.549 --> 20:39.990
Not much.

20:40.671 --> 20:41.873
Not much at all.

20:41.893 --> 20:43.296
I mean, living down at our lair.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.680
See, we thought he was a kind of a blank.

20:45.700 --> 20:45.901
Yeah.

20:46.682 --> 20:49.427
Yeah, I didn't.

20:50.168 --> 20:53.534
Were there some tough courses that freshman year?

20:54.837 --> 20:58.723
Oh, yeah, you know, math courses and chemistry and physics.

20:59.184 --> 21:01.288
Did some of them have nicknames, some of those courses?

21:01.623 --> 21:07.530
No, I mean, the only course that really had a nickname for us was Thermo, goddammit.

21:10.814 --> 21:14.619
Thermo was the course that separated the engineers from the business majors.

21:15.380 --> 21:25.992
And I can remember I got through Thermo the first time with a passing grade and said, thank you, Lord, and never looked back.

21:26.032 --> 21:28.495
And a lot of my buddies took Thermo two and three times.

21:28.876 --> 21:31.579
Did you ever hear about any giveaway courses?

21:33.348 --> 21:35.794
Oh, you heard about them.

21:36.315 --> 21:40.025
There were certain, you know, you'd hear about those courses.

21:40.085 --> 21:41.488
I don't remember many of them in engineering.

21:42.210 --> 21:49.669
Alright, did you ever hear of any that were athletes that were any courses specially for athletes or anybody else?

21:50.864 --> 21:51.445
in that era?

21:51.605 --> 21:51.845
No.

21:51.925 --> 21:53.727
I didn't know about any if there ever were.

21:54.508 --> 21:59.394
And one of the, speaking of athletes, there was a guy named Joe Weiss who was a football player who was an engineering major.

21:59.414 --> 21:59.754
Weiss?

22:00.095 --> 22:00.395
Weiss.

22:01.316 --> 22:02.558
W-E-I-S-S.

22:02.578 --> 22:03.318
W-E-I-S-S, I think.

22:04.139 --> 22:11.948
And I had some classes with him and he'd come over to the core dorms sometimes and study because it was always, I mean particularly during CQ, it was always quiet.

22:11.968 --> 22:15.893
A lot of non-regs would come over to the core dorms to study.

22:16.632 --> 22:22.160
But I can remember really holding him in high respect because he was a football player and he was taking engineering.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.404
And I thought that was a pretty tough grind.

22:25.645 --> 22:25.745
Yeah.

22:26.486 --> 22:26.806
All right.

22:29.029 --> 22:30.992
Fish day, your freshman year.

22:31.393 --> 22:32.053
What was it like?

22:32.855 --> 22:38.202
Well, I think I talked about earlier on here that we woke up being babble bombed.

22:38.840 --> 22:45.147
And then we found out immediately that it wasn't what it was cracked up to be.

22:45.167 --> 22:53.057
You'd been told that it was this, that the tables would be turned and you'd be piss heads and the piss heads would be fish and you could do anything to them you want to.

22:53.117 --> 22:55.039
Well, obviously they wouldn't do anything you told them to do.

22:56.180 --> 23:02.588
And we found out that they had all the fish privileges, which meant they could do anything they could get away with.

23:03.469 --> 23:06.332
And so they made fish day pretty miserable.

23:06.633 --> 23:30.733
the fish starting out with the babble bombs in the morning and uh so when you go home after that first year you are a solid aggie what'd you do that summer um i worked um that summer i think i worked in a filling station i'd worked in a bakery that before that but i worked in a filling station

23:30.882 --> 23:32.704
for the next several summers.

23:33.205 --> 23:35.508
And that's basically how I made money to go to college.

23:35.548 --> 23:40.414
I had to save all that in the summer so that I had spending money during the school year.

23:40.435 --> 23:43.819
And you never had any thoughts about changing a major or changing your school?

23:44.039 --> 23:46.783
Never, never, ever, ever.

23:46.803 --> 23:58.358
And if you had, what would your dad's... Well, if I had, you know, I would have probably been excommunicated from the family, you know.

23:59.182 --> 24:05.848
Particularly since my father had not gone to college, but loved A&M.

24:05.868 --> 24:06.809
He would have made a good Aggie.

24:06.829 --> 24:08.390
He loved A&M.

24:08.410 --> 24:11.153
And of course my brother had already gone to A&M and graduated.

24:11.773 --> 24:15.237
So I really didn't, it was kind of like the situation with my youngest son.

24:15.277 --> 24:21.182
After my oldest son had gone, had been in the court and everything else, my youngest son didn't have a choice either.

24:21.783 --> 24:24.605
So it was that situation.

24:24.625 --> 24:27.788
How was the sophomore year better?

24:28.814 --> 24:32.724
Well, sophomore year, you're not a human being yet, but you're getting close.

24:33.767 --> 24:42.790
And you're still liable for all sorts of stuff and can be punished as a class for not doing your stuff right.

24:43.040 --> 24:46.466
But you've got that certain cockiness and you do have a class below you.

24:46.486 --> 24:53.799
I mean about the most disappointing thing about the final review of your fish year is there's nobody to haze as soon as you become a piss head.

24:54.300 --> 24:56.504
Do you remember the final review of freshman year?

24:56.904 --> 24:57.345
Oh yeah.

24:57.606 --> 25:02.314
I remember the final review of freshman year and putting on that black braid.

25:02.632 --> 25:07.337
everything else, and you just feel like, God, you've made it.

25:08.098 --> 25:11.441
You look around at your fish buds and you think about all those that didn't make it.

25:11.601 --> 25:12.642
You've finally been freed.

25:12.962 --> 25:14.264
You've finally been freed.

25:16.606 --> 25:17.827
Being a sophomore was a good deal.

25:18.928 --> 25:27.357
All right, then you're staying with the four-year plan, and so you're taking a heavy load.

25:28.568 --> 25:31.533
anything unusual happen in the sophomore year?

25:32.574 --> 25:35.319
Any special plus or minus experiences?

25:40.326 --> 25:46.316
Anybody, any fish give you a babo bomb or any other kind of a?

25:46.336 --> 25:46.396
No.

25:48.279 --> 25:51.103
How did you try to treat the freshmen?

25:51.123 --> 25:52.566
I tried to treat them.

25:54.148 --> 25:56.652
I tried, I was not,

25:56.868 --> 25:59.632
in the term of the day, a red ass piss head.

26:00.834 --> 26:08.365
I tried to make sure the fish were doing what they supposed to do, knew what they needed to know, those sorts of things.

26:09.787 --> 26:11.028
But I guess for two reasons.

26:11.089 --> 26:16.416
Number one is I didn't have a whole lot of time to mess around with that, again because of the engineering major.

26:17.097 --> 26:18.319
But number two,

26:20.611 --> 26:22.875
I just wanted to make sure that they were doing what they were supposed to do.

26:23.536 --> 26:36.918
We didn't really have a lot of guys in our class that would be, quote, red ass, that would do things that were out of line, that sort of stuff.

26:37.338 --> 26:43.969
And because of the nature of the outfit and that sort of stuff, I never got battle-bombed or drowned out.

26:44.557 --> 26:49.605
I guess I was one of those likable business that the fish didn't hate.

26:50.226 --> 26:51.868
Now, you didn't have a car yet.

26:52.369 --> 26:53.371
Didn't have a car yet.

26:53.391 --> 26:55.854
And you had just started dating this special young lady?

26:55.874 --> 26:56.916
Yeah, I started doing that.

26:57.196 --> 26:59.921
And so she would come up for a football weekend.

27:00.201 --> 27:01.122
Now, how would she get there?

27:02.204 --> 27:05.189
She would, oddly enough, her mother would bring her up.

27:05.409 --> 27:06.471
My wife is from Cuba.

27:07.833 --> 27:08.674
And...

27:09.295 --> 27:14.983
And her family had friends who were there who were on the faculty, in fact.

27:15.003 --> 27:25.278
And so she would drive her up to A&M for football weekends, you know, the typical Spanish chaperoning and that sort of stuff.

27:25.719 --> 27:27.521
So she would stay with the faculty friends?

27:28.202 --> 27:31.807
Yeah, she and her mother would stay with the faculty friends or stay in a hotel.

27:32.368 --> 27:34.832
And so I would say, here, guys, here's my date, and this is her mother.

27:35.312 --> 27:38.577
But anyway, we got past that.

27:38.945 --> 27:45.592
Do you remember the first football game you took her to and any Aggie touchdowns?

27:46.032 --> 27:46.433
Oh, yeah.

27:46.973 --> 27:51.558
Yeah, and we were honest to tradition in that game.

27:52.519 --> 27:54.041
My wife is really gung-ho.

27:54.802 --> 28:02.450
And she had been going up to A&M before we met because of these friends that were up there and loved A&M.

28:03.611 --> 28:07.215
And she didn't go to school there, but she might as well have.

28:07.235 --> 28:08.496
I mean, she bleeds maroon.

28:08.898 --> 28:11.481
And for our kids, I mean, with the two of us, they had no choice.

28:11.942 --> 28:15.186
And in fact, neither of our kids applied anyplace but A&M.

28:15.707 --> 28:17.750
Were there still the big dances?

28:18.370 --> 28:20.373
Oh, yeah, big dances on the weekends.

28:20.413 --> 28:21.354
Describe one of those.

28:25.179 --> 28:28.223
Shoot, just, well, I don't know of anything special.

28:29.144 --> 28:30.066
They were in Cebisa.

28:30.206 --> 28:34.792
In Cebisa, yeah, and you just go over there and, God, I'm trying to think of anything.

28:34.812 --> 28:36.113
About how long did they last?

28:36.634 --> 28:38.837
Oh, till late in the evening.

28:40.235 --> 28:41.657
And how did people behave?

28:41.897 --> 28:46.423
Oh, I mean never, never anything unusual.

28:47.024 --> 28:53.052
Did the young ladies have cards?

28:53.833 --> 28:54.774
Not at that time.

28:55.295 --> 28:58.239
Was it accepted for other Aggies to cut in?

28:59.440 --> 29:01.483
Yeah, yeah.

29:02.459 --> 29:06.044
I mean, just for a dance or so, but that was about it.

29:06.064 --> 29:09.650
And you didn't, and we had, you know, things were sacrosanct.

29:09.670 --> 29:10.812
Your girlfriend was sacrosanct.

29:10.832 --> 29:18.103
You never criticized an individual's hometown, their parents, or their girlfriend.

29:18.123 --> 29:20.887
You never said anything bad about those things.

29:22.149 --> 29:28.078
And that included upperclassmen would never say anything to a freshman that criticized those things.

29:28.683 --> 29:32.550
And there were no pranks related to a dance?

29:33.772 --> 29:35.596
No, I don't remember anything related to a dance.

29:35.616 --> 29:38.461
That was a pretty special occasion, you know, when you had girls up there.

29:38.742 --> 29:41.326
And did the women always go in formals?

29:42.328 --> 29:47.838
Oh yeah, everybody would dress up, either formals or a nice dress, depending on what the kind of dance was.

29:49.041 --> 29:50.944
And the odd thing is, you know, that place,

29:51.228 --> 30:16.273
was a monastery during the week but on the weekend football weekend I mean some of the most gorgeous women you'd ever seen just came out of nowhere at their place there was never a problem getting a date to come up to A&M never ever I mean any girl you knew all you had is call her and say hey would you like to come up for a football game and man the answer was yes right away they loved coming there talk about Sabisa though

30:17.333 --> 30:18.435
side light here.

30:19.416 --> 30:24.584
My sophomore year, we were living in Subisa, and Subisa of course seats 4,000, or did then.

30:26.127 --> 30:33.658
And so you had all the Army and Air Force and everything in there, and I can remember, shoot, I think it was like second semester.

30:37.604 --> 30:45.096
I was sitting with my back, we were in the dividing line between the Air Force and the Army, and my back was to the Army tables.

30:46.291 --> 30:53.902
And I can remember to this day hearing this table turn over and hit the ground, and all the things spill off of it.

30:54.402 --> 31:06.279
And I looked around, and all the people at that table were behind it, and the air was full of water pitchers, milk bottles, all sorts of stuff.

31:06.740 --> 31:08.122
A food fight had begun.

31:08.162 --> 31:09.103
Oh, oh, oh.

31:09.123 --> 31:09.444
Yes.

31:10.185 --> 31:15.252
And I mean, there was a deal with rolls.

31:15.367 --> 31:17.092
But this was not a good thing.
