WEBVTT

00:02.444 --> 00:07.329
What about re-arming Germany in the early 1950s? 
You were there, and did you participate? What was

00:12.133 --> 00:12.934
your role? I guess my role was trying to build a U.S. 
Seventh Army from 55,000 up to 225,000 at the time,

00:17.799 --> 00:29.970
and fitting that buildup into

00:17.799 --> 00:29.970
the

00:33.629 --> 01:02.522
into West Germany as cheaply as possible by using 
old German facilities

00:33.629 --> 01:02.522
because of the great expense and at the same time 
that being tactically unsound in some instances

00:33.629 --> 01:02.522
but because of money I was troubled with finding 
places so we had to use what we could find

01:03.413 --> 01:04.915
available. And then to see the German army come in 
and the German government build brand new

01:05.856 --> 01:20.832
facilities, brand new barracks, brand new motor 
pools, brand new living areas and so on and so forth

01:05.856 --> 01:20.832
for them. And here the conqueror was taking the 
crap, the old stuff that they had discarded and The

01:32.928 --> 01:44.059
victor was taking that and the loser was getting 
brand new stuff and being tactically deployed

01:32.928 --> 01:44.059
where it's to his advantage. The

01:44.099 --> 02:01.095
philosophy and the principle behind re-arming a 
germ is absolutely supportable and durable and

01:44.099 --> 02:01.095
that's the way it ought to be. and unfortunately it 
hasn't lessened our effort over there or

02:02.662 --> 02:25.362
expenditure which has been very disturbing to me 
that as we Germans have built five hundred

02:02.662 --> 02:25.362
thousand and twelve divisions

02:02.662 --> 02:25.362
as you know they have a draft for sixteen months 
fifteen sixteen months They have no

02:27.046 --> 02:38.579
responsibilities outside of West Germany, so 
they get proper utilization out of 15 to 16 months

02:27.046 --> 02:38.579
of conscription. And then those chaps, after they 
leave, go into the reserve in what they call the

02:38.719 --> 02:53.475
territorial forces, and they become a part of the 
defense effort, a very strong part of the defense

02:38.719 --> 02:53.475
effort.

02:56.358 --> 03:08.202
Right today, their tanks and trucks are all 
maintained by the manufacturer, so they don't

02:56.358 --> 03:08.202
have a long logistics tail. In other words, the Mon 
10-ton truck

03:14.077 --> 03:17.201
maintained by that civilian corporation. At the 
time of conflict, their constitution states that

03:17.321 --> 03:27.034
80% of the industrial effort will go toward 
maintenance of the armed forces. So you've got a

03:28.596 --> 03:37.829
pretty strong logistic base there that's working 
every day commercially, and that makes it a very

03:28.596 --> 03:37.829
strong force, I think. With the territorials, 
they could probably expand to 24 or 25 divisions or

03:43.878 --> 03:48.843
more without any trouble with people that are 
trained. They're very well organized. And I think

03:52.547 --> 03:56.492
it's a direction, I think it's an appropriate 
direction to go. And as I say, I only wish that

03:57.032 --> 04:06.843
there's some way that we could have withered on 
some of our strength there. On the other hand, in

04:07.704 --> 04:11.488
this world in which we live today, is my firm 
conviction and view that the further our front

04:12.920 --> 04:21.711
lines are away from our shores, the better off we 
are. It's bad enough with a range of weapons today.

04:26.757 --> 04:30.682
It's bad enough with strategic weapons. But 
you've got Soviet submarines floating around out

04:32.004 --> 04:39.653
here that can reach Dallas, Texas without any 
trouble with a nuclear warhead. can hit Houston

04:40.730 --> 04:46.618
with no problem at all from submarines that are 
floating out there. 1,500-2,000

04:46.638 --> 04:51.284
mile capability. You've got the MiG-23s and 
MiG-25s down in Cuba that can come into the Florida

04:53.066 --> 05:07.885
area any day they want to.

05:09.518 --> 05:23.175
We have one airplane that can touch the MiG-25 and 
that's a SR-71 and our SR-71 carries no weapons so

05:09.518 --> 05:23.175
you don't kill MiG-25s with cameras. So this is the 
seriousness of the situation today and I only

05:25.477 --> 05:39.154
mention that to point out that NATO is a durable and 
workable viable organization so long as

05:39.455 --> 05:49.505
everybody over there does its part and that the 
United States is not saddled with the whole

05:39.455 --> 05:49.505
burden. And I have felt all along that the trend was 
toward get as much out of the United States before

05:50.926 --> 06:01.036
you do anything, you see, because they're a soft 
nation. They're an undisciplined group of people

06:01.096 --> 06:09.124
that are very soft and want everybody to love them 
so they'll spend money to get somebody to love

06:09.880 --> 06:12.723
them, you see. They'll give millions and billions 
of dollars to somebody, oh, if you'll just love us,

06:12.743 --> 06:18.129
you know. But love isn't worry, it's respect, and 
respect comes from being a tough bunch of

06:18.689 --> 06:26.097
bastards, and we're not that way. So everybody's 
gouging us. Now, getting back to your first

06:30.022 --> 06:37.770
assignment as commander of the Special Troops 
Regiment, I was wondering why were you called

06:30.022 --> 06:37.770
Special Troops? What was special about you 
people? It's special because it was not a combat

06:40.407 --> 06:49.969
table of organization. It is a special 
organization to meet the requirements of a high

06:51.473 --> 06:58.028
headquarters. In other words, on my personnel 
reports each day, I carried all the generals and

06:58.683 --> 07:15.172
the colonels and that sort of stuff, and all the 
senior sergeants, everybody in that

06:58.683 --> 07:15.172
headquarters carried a couple thousand of them, a 
thousand or more. And then you had special

07:17.136 --> 07:22.986
intelligence of several different types of 
units. you had special security in there.

07:32.965 --> 07:47.587
So, there's nothing, that headquarters, those 
troops, there's nothing consistent with

07:32.965 --> 07:47.587
anywhere else that was designed to support that 
particular mission, you see. During this period,

07:47.647 --> 07:54.357
you were there during a very fascinating period of 
rebuilding in Germany, By 1947, we had

07:55.028 --> 08:08.026
promulgated the Marshall Plan and we started 
pumping money for the next year into the country,

07:55.028 --> 08:08.026
quite a bit of money from 48 down to 52. What were the 
relationships that you had with the German people

08:10.129 --> 08:16.058
while this rebuilding was going on?

08:19.623 --> 08:24.850
We had almost daily contact. some aspect of German 
society.

08:32.922 --> 08:53.389
They had a large number of German workers, some 
German clerks in the headquarters, some German

08:32.922 --> 08:53.389
people with responsibility for maintenance of 
facilities, labor force. We had relationships

08:53.409 --> 08:56.153
with a with a mayor's where we had, and a 
Burgermeister's where we had troops

08:57.398 --> 09:15.300
stationed, and each small installation had a 
relationship with the German community. We took

09:16.722 --> 09:24.992
on, the Army took on a responsibility for setting 
up German-American clubs for the soldiers for

09:25.900 --> 09:46.074
bringing in German families into the military 
organization for Sunday lunches and dinners and

09:25.900 --> 09:46.074
socials and the

09:25.900 --> 09:46.074
relationships were growing continuously. We got 
involved in helping the ladies clubs, got

09:50.200 --> 10:07.603
involved with German ladies in running care 
centers for the disabled German people and

09:50.200 --> 10:07.603
providing food and clothing and that sort of 
thing. And we took on even a more intense role of

10:13.606 --> 10:23.500
community relations than you find here amongst 
our people right now because I don't know the name

10:13.606 --> 10:23.500
of that neighbor over there, but you did in 
Germany. How did the German people respond to you,

10:24.702 --> 10:28.528
the conqueror? I thought they responded in this 
sort of fashion. After the war is over, you could

10:33.976 --> 10:41.807
not find one single Nazi in Germany. You didn't 
survive unless you were one, you see? So that was

10:51.696 --> 10:59.245
their attitude and we looked over our shoulder and 
accepted that.

11:02.269 --> 11:04.772
So we got along very well. Miss

11:05.974 --> 11:10.900
Hollingsworth could speaks in German and read 
German and we had a few incidences which were

11:11.116 --> 11:40.583
embarrassing such as Miss Hollingsworth and I 
trout fishing in a stream and we're doing very well

11:11.116 --> 11:40.583
and then she gets tired and goes back to the 
automobile to rest and I'm continuing to fish and

11:11.116 --> 11:40.583
I've come to an area and And the trout just seemed 
like it was just loaded with trout. And a German

11:45.307 --> 11:55.837
Jägermeister, I find out who he was later, was 
hollering in there saying, no, no, no fishing

11:45.307 --> 11:55.837
here. So I stepped back to the car and I said, 
there's some German down here yelling at me. And

12:04.685 --> 12:10.030
said, I wish you'd come down here and tell him to get 
on his way or find out what the hell he wants. So she

12:11.680 --> 12:14.643
came down and she said, I don't have to ask him. She 
said, you're fishing in a fish hatchery. I said,

12:20.569 --> 12:24.393
well I thought they were biting pretty good here. 
So she apologized to him and I left.

12:37.846 --> 12:38.987
Well, That's the best fishing you ever had. Yeah, 
oh, man, they were really strong. Every time I

12:43.060 --> 12:50.170
threw a spinner out there, I was bringing in about a 
10-inch German brown. There were just plenty of

12:50.190 --> 12:53.274
them in there. And they were hungry, too. Oh, they 
were hungry.

12:58.361 --> 13:07.354
But I thought the relationships, you know, it's a 
very difficult thing, not so much for soldiers.

13:08.144 --> 13:19.376
After a battle is over and it's on the force, a 
soldier can sit down and smoke a cigarette

13:08.144 --> 13:19.376
together and if they can understand the same 
language, they have no hard feelings about it.

13:21.578 --> 13:24.901
Because they're just doing what they ordered to 
do. But not so much

13:24.921 --> 13:36.413
with the young and the old and the civilian side of 
things.

13:38.131 --> 13:41.256
I would say it's more difficult for them. They 
suffered tremendously. They suffered from a lack

13:45.402 --> 13:57.539
of food, a variety of food, and the discomfort of 
not being able to do what they like to do. In the case

13:58.000 --> 14:03.408
of Germany, Germans mostly work. They all go on 
vacation in August. County did in August, because

14:08.219 --> 14:13.024
everybody goes on vacation in August. Shores, 
stores closed, everything closed. Bare

14:18.270 --> 14:19.772
essentials go on. Well, that didn't happen for 
them during the war years. And nothing that was

14:26.460 --> 14:32.767
going on, as far as I'm concerned, they enjoyed at 
all. So now that the war is over and what they had

14:37.261 --> 14:41.847
lived for all their lives, much of it had been 
destroyed and blown away. Their fields and farms

14:41.887 --> 14:46.854
were bombs and potholes. Now, while you were 
there, of course, Korea, the Korean conflict

14:48.095 --> 14:53.583
started. Did you want to go to Korea? Did you 
volunteer for that? I volunteered for Korea, but

14:57.668 --> 15:06.019
since I was Chief of Operations, General Eddy, who 
was the Army Lieutenant General, Manton S. Eddy, a

15:06.387 --> 15:18.334
magnificent gentleman, EDDY, Manton S. Eddy, he 
felt this way about it. He said, why do you want to

15:18.394 --> 15:25.290
leave me here when you're building up this force 
here for me and run off to Korea? And I said, well,

15:27.329 --> 15:29.713
there's war going on there. And he said, what 
you're doing here is trying to prevent one. So

15:32.657 --> 15:37.305
which is important, trying to prevent one or go try 
to put out a fire when one started? He said, you're

15:37.665 --> 15:39.628
going to stay here, young man. So I said, yes, sir, 
I'll stay here. And then, lo and behold,

15:45.197 --> 15:53.370
we get a message in within a week or so saying, you 
have been selected for the Command and General

15:53.570 --> 15:58.395
Staff College. So, I didn't have any choice about 
that. Well, that's quite an honor. Yes, and

16:03.781 --> 16:12.089
particularly selected the head of my 
contemporaries.

16:12.109 --> 16:15.333
So that was in August of 1951 until June of 1952. 
Let's talk about the Command and General Staff

16:16.514 --> 16:19.557
School. Wasn't this, when was it instituted?

16:25.666 --> 16:27.870
third or fourth class of that? Well, actually the 
Command and General Staff College goes way back.

16:35.722 --> 16:38.026
Oh, I'm thinking of something else now. Yeah, 
you're talking about the Army War College. That's

16:40.190 --> 16:41.572
what I'm thinking about. But Command and General 
Staff College is probably the most important

16:42.233 --> 16:51.488
school in the military arts there is in the world 
because—and I say world because that's where a lot

16:52.430 --> 17:02.865
of the students come from, from the world—less 
communist nations. It takes you and

17:05.049 --> 17:20.732
says you're going to—it

17:05.049 --> 17:20.732
would appear those who are selected The record 
says you're going to high staff positions and

17:21.472 --> 17:29.280
command positions.

17:32.563 --> 17:36.768
And that's why it says command and the staff up at 
the division level. In other words, the command of

17:36.968 --> 17:44.235
a division and staff at the Department of the Army 
level. And it is the equivalent of a master's

17:44.255 --> 17:50.922
degree in our school system. Our advanced course 
is the equivalency of a baccalaureate degree in

17:51.543 --> 17:59.836
military art and science. Command and General 
Staff College is the equivalent of a master's

18:00.877 --> 18:09.050
degree in military art and sciences. The Army War 
College is the equivalent of a Ph.D. in military

18:10.773 --> 18:16.221
art and science. And as you higher you go, The more 
selective and the fewer, they get a chance to go.

18:25.801 --> 18:32.791
And if you don't go, you just remember that your 
career is going to be short lived. And no question

18:32.811 --> 18:34.093
about that. You'll get to be maybe a lieutenant 
colonel unless you get a command general staff

18:35.815 --> 18:47.993
school and you're out at that year twenty or if 
you're a reserve officer you may be released long

18:35.815 --> 18:47.993
before that. If you do go to command, you're on 
staff.

18:56.535 --> 19:02.624
You can probably count on being promoted to 
colonel if you do well. Tell me about the

19:02.644 --> 19:04.186
curriculum. Curriculum is a very intense day in, 
day out, a lot of night work.

19:20.322 --> 19:49.907
gets deeply involved in the leadership of people, 
management,

19:20.322 --> 19:49.907
transportation, finance,

19:20.322 --> 19:49.907
logistics,

19:20.322 --> 19:49.907
tactical considerations,

19:20.322 --> 19:49.907
political

19:20.322 --> 19:49.907
aspects of

19:51.592 --> 19:57.801
land and business management. It is a long, 
intense, hard year. How many were in your class?

20:05.992 --> 20:10.899
There was six hundred in my class, including 
foreign students. And what nations were they

20:10.919 --> 20:13.022
usually from? Canada, New Zealand, all the 
commonwealth nations, New Zealand, India,

20:22.102 --> 20:43.003
Pakistan, Korea, now Japanese,

20:22.102 --> 20:43.003
Brazil,

20:22.102 --> 20:43.003
sometimes Peru, sometimes Argentina. Mexico? It 
used to be Ethiopia, Mexico. When I was there, I

20:48.393 --> 20:52.639
think there were about forty nations there. But 
the Brits, Canadians, New Zealand, Commonwealth

20:54.542 --> 21:00.850
nations have two or three there. And we do the same 
thing for them.

21:06.819 --> 21:12.707
But it's a very intense program requiring a lot of 
night work. Now you said that you weren't a very

21:12.727 --> 21:15.150
good student at A&M. Were you a very good student at 
this school? in the top ten percent of this school.

21:20.929 --> 21:24.636
What was the difference?

21:25.196 --> 21:28.402
Time to study, time to concentrate on it. I didn't 
have to spend eight hours of work a day. I see. I

21:32.088 --> 21:33.070
didn't spend any. As a matter of fact, I played golf 
at three o'clock every day,

21:33.791 --> 21:43.408
and met all the requirements

21:47.523 --> 21:52.810
It's, and I must say, it's not very easy in school.

21:55.473 --> 21:58.257
And from there you became an instructor at West 
Point. Yes, I- That certainly didn't set you up for

21:58.618 --> 22:02.523
a command position, did it? No, but during the life 
of the military, let's see, where were we? You were

22:10.203 --> 22:13.487
talking about during the life of the military. I 
said I didn't set you up for a command position.

22:17.914 --> 22:19.295
You're off to West Point. Yeah. Again, I wanted to 
go to Korea. Oh, you put in for Korea? I put in for

22:24.883 --> 22:27.767
Korea, and they turned me down. And I found out that 
the man responsible for me going to with being

22:40.426 --> 22:53.839
selected for West Point was General Maxwell D. 
Taylor, who was the chief of operations and plans

22:40.426 --> 22:53.839
in the Department of the Army who selected the 
people to go. And at the same time, amongst the

22:56.241 --> 23:10.095
officers in the Army, there is a requirement to do 
civilian component duty. In other words, to go to

23:12.522 --> 23:34.570
ROTC or to go work with the reserves or go to 
National Guard or go to United Nations or some

23:12.522 --> 23:34.570
other place, ROTC is a key one which has not been 
given all the credit it ought to have and the

23:12.522 --> 23:34.570
caliber of people in every instance it ought to 
have. So you knew that you were up for a position

23:36.031 --> 23:40.377
like that. You were probably overdue. I was 
overdue, way overdue. I've never asked for an

23:44.999 --> 23:57.531
assignment except to go to combat and I've never 
objected to one. So off I went to West Point and

23:57.591 --> 24:06.960
found out that General Taylor was responsible for 
that. Did you later get to know General Taylor? Oh

24:09.042 --> 24:10.744
yes. I was at West Point, and in December, I guess, 
of 1953, I got a call from the

24:11.095 --> 24:33.542
Department of the Army saying that General 
Matthew B. Ridgeway The Supreme Allied Commander

24:33.877 --> 24:48.270
had been appointed Chief of Staff in the Army, and 
you were to report to his office for duty on a, on

24:33.877 --> 24:48.270
very short notice in December of 1953. And I didn't 
want to leave West Point because I loved those

24:48.290 --> 24:51.913
cadets. They were just absolutely magnificent. 
In fact, two of those cadets worked for my company

24:55.016 --> 25:01.401
that I have in Washington right now. And they were 
just absolutely the most marvelous bunch of young

25:04.083 --> 25:07.827
men I've ever associated with. And the West Point, 
the whole life up there, they treated Miss

25:08.868 --> 25:21.343
Hollingsworth and our son, Jamo, just 
absolutely. I met Vince Lombardi there, Lince

25:21.423 --> 25:28.791
Lombardi, yeah, and Earl Blake was there, and 
every time I got down a chance to go down and talk to

25:29.108 --> 25:30.770
them, I did. As a matter of fact, I taught handball 
there at West Point. I was responsible for the

25:34.354 --> 25:37.717
pistol team. I was responsible for the fishing and 
hunting at West Point on the reservation for the

25:37.737 --> 25:47.327
cadets. I enjoyed that very much. So I went to 
Washington. So that's what you were instructing?

25:57.121 --> 26:03.129
I was an instructor in tactics and leadership, but 
I did all these other side things. You do those

26:04.210 --> 26:10.798
extracurricular things, so to speak, without 
pay, but that's the way it goes. But I

26:11.519 --> 26:23.955
went to Washington and

26:11.519 --> 26:23.955
then very And you met Ridgway, right? Yeah, then a 
very interesting occurred. Well, what happened

26:28.882 --> 26:30.844
as far as Ridgway? Well, um, John Ridgway decided 
that he could more or less, he retired or left on his

26:30.864 --> 26:51.968
own accord because of conflict with Eisenhower 
and engine Charlie Wilson. And I was deeply

26:53.416 --> 26:58.805
involved. I was one of the five colonels that 
revolted against the President of the United

26:59.065 --> 27:07.379
States and the Secretary of Defense. Was this a 
so-called colonel's revolt? Colonel's revolt.

27:10.504 --> 27:11.465
And you were in on that? Oh, I was one of the key 
members of it. Well, let's talk about that. I can't

27:16.293 --> 27:17.635
talk too much about it. Well, you could give me a 
basic outline of how it came about and your role.

27:22.749 --> 27:47.706
Basic outline, uh, I don't want to say too much 
about it because there's some high-level people

27:22.749 --> 27:47.706
that, uh, in government today, in the legislative 
branch, in the retired status that, uh, it's best

27:22.749 --> 27:47.706
not be said, uh, the whole story until, uh, And 
because I'm just that way about it, I will say that

27:47.939 --> 28:12.023
it came about as,

27:47.939 --> 28:12.023
in my view—I'll just put it this way and not 
implicate what happened—in my view, it all came

27:47.939 --> 28:12.023
about as a result

28:13.960 --> 28:17.786
The grand old Big Bang for the buck. What's good for 
General Motors is good for the United States. A fat

28:25.519 --> 28:29.766
bird dog won't hunt, and people are like bird dogs. 
All of Wilson's cliches. All of Wilson's cliches.

28:34.233 --> 28:36.036
And Eisenhower... I now are trying to destroy the 
army. We don't need any army. We don't need a

28:44.214 --> 28:46.256
tactical air force. All you need is strategic 
bombers and missiles, and that's all. And it's

28:52.482 --> 29:02.513
obvious to anybody that's got any sense and any 
responsibility to this country to know that which

29:03.674 --> 29:30.257
has been a proven fact that by God you do need an army 
and you need a navy and you need an air force and you

29:03.674 --> 29:30.257
need all elements of both of them in order to defend 
this country and this country deserves that and it

29:03.674 --> 29:30.257
wasn't getting that and that's the reason why I 
participated in the colonel with the other four to

29:03.674 --> 29:30.257
revolt against this stuff. And we did it pretty 
effectively. We got caught up with it on the 26th of

29:33.965 --> 29:46.793
April, 1955, or 1956.

29:47.454 --> 29:52.986
We got caught up with it and we were all threatened 
with court martial.

29:56.273 --> 30:05.543
And you've got to be, if you're going to get 
involved in this sort of thing, I'll just put it

29:56.273 --> 30:05.543
this way, you've got to be smart enough to take care 
of it and look at the option of getting caught and

29:56.273 --> 30:05.543
what you do about it. So you just create a fire in the 
Pentagon and burn everything. If I'd have been in

30:10.468 --> 30:16.815
the White House, Mr. Nixon never would have had to 
resign because I'd have burned these damn tapes

30:10.468 --> 30:16.815
whether he didn't want to or not.

30:19.718 --> 30:25.825
So this thing, as a result of it,

30:29.517 --> 30:36.747
We got a handle on tactical air support. We got the 
mobility we needed for the Army and helicopters.

30:44.958 --> 30:57.094
We still got a long ways to go, but we reversed the 
trend of destruction of the Army and the

30:44.958 --> 30:57.094
destruction of the tactical air force. We got 
C-130s, 141s, we got C-5As.

31:10.185 --> 31:28.988
Now, we haven't been totally happy with 
everything that we got, but we turned the trend

31:10.185 --> 31:28.988
back from destruction of the Army and depending on 
the Strategic Air Command and the nuclear,

31:10.185 --> 31:28.988
strategic nukes,

31:31.432 --> 31:36.878
the one of bringing some sense and balance to 
what's needed to defend the country. You need

31:38.420 --> 31:39.921
several options. You need a fulfillment of the 
present options we have and a continuous

31:41.623 --> 32:01.084
readiness and a continuous modernization of the 
strategic capability of the conventional

31:41.623 --> 32:01.084
deterrent capability

32:03.697 --> 32:22.378
and theater nuclear, tactical nuclear 
capability, and one in which we just lost in the

32:03.697 --> 32:22.378
Congress again, a chemical offensive 
capability, which the Soviets, our opponents,

32:03.697 --> 32:22.378
have and we don't have. So they could exercise that 
option against us, and we have no capability to

32:23.099 --> 32:32.590
exercise the same option against them. because he 
was killed just a few days ago in the Congress. Now,

32:41.017 --> 32:47.005
as far as the colonel's revolt is concerned, could 
you give me a little bit more specifics just on your

32:41.017 --> 32:47.005
own role? We don't have to talk about the other men. 
My role was to cover the Congress.

32:54.295 --> 33:02.205
To pass to them selected

32:54.295 --> 33:02.205
groups what we were up to. At this time you were in 
the Pentagon as the chief of the liaison division.

33:09.361 --> 33:15.146
So you were working with the congressman and you 
were the liaison between the Pentagon. Yes. Okay.

33:16.947 --> 33:17.668
During the Army. Chief of Staff, I was in the Chief 
of Staff's office. You represented— I was the

33:22.312 --> 33:24.474
secretary of the Army. Yeah, right. Those are the 
two guys I represented on the Hill. Okay. Let's go

33:32.138 --> 33:37.604
more into your role and how this transpired for 
you. My role was one of working about 18 hours a day,

33:38.305 --> 34:00.930
meeting

33:38.305 --> 34:00.930
with the other colonels who had different 
responsibilities,

33:38.305 --> 34:00.930
and putting together the kind of an army that we 
felt we needed in order to defend the country.

34:13.766 --> 34:16.791
The Eisenhower approach was a pentomic army. Let 
me give you a good example of what he was talking

34:19.295 --> 34:22.040
about. Pentomic army, division, pentomic 
division.

34:32.247 --> 34:53.509
Pentomic Division was five battalions of 
infantry

34:32.247 --> 34:53.509
plus one battery of artillery for each of those 
five battalions

34:32.247 --> 34:53.509
and the supporting element for them. And five 
batteries of artillery in a division and only five

34:53.529 --> 34:58.895
battalions? That's not a division. That's about a 
good brigade, less the artillery it really needs.

35:10.502 --> 35:12.464
Well, let's look at five battalions.

35:15.328 --> 35:21.295
Say there's 1,000 men in each battalion, actually 
750 infantrymen in each battalion. That's five

35:22.156 --> 35:23.538
times 750.

35:26.241 --> 35:29.305
What is the strength of a regular division at that 
time? 15,000 to 18,000. How many battalions of

35:32.795 --> 35:35.579
infantry? Six battalions of infantry, four tank 
battalions, or two tank battalions,

35:36.660 --> 35:51.001
plus four battalions of artillery, four times 18. 
That's what we went from down to the pandemic, a

35:53.224 --> 35:58.892
total destruction of capability. And I couldn't 
stand that. Nobody could stand that. So we set out

36:05.644 --> 36:15.099
to

36:05.644 --> 36:15.099
save an army. And one of the key areas to save the 
army is the one that has the responsibility for

36:16.260 --> 36:30.342
raising and maintaining the armed forces, and 
that's the Congress of the United States.

36:31.165 --> 36:59.333
briefed select members one of the ones that when it 
finally got around to we had to search industry to

36:31.165 --> 36:59.333
see if industry could support what we wanted to do 
in maintaining an army in building an army getting

36:31.165 --> 36:59.333
helicopters building a tactical air force troop 
carrier capability fighter aircraft that could

36:31.165 --> 36:59.333
support the army new munitions and that sort of 
stuff, to build a conventional capability

37:00.342 --> 37:12.713
against this business of the great big umbrella 
and all the wars going down under it, and which they

37:00.342 --> 37:12.713
did. Korea was a conventional war under the big 
umbrella. The nuclear umbrella. Sure. The same

37:20.400 --> 37:24.123
thing in all other parts of the world. In Lebanon, 
it's going on right today. Conventional war.

37:28.810 --> 37:30.092
under the big umbrella. And what's the big 
umbrella done about the nuclear strategic

37:30.112 --> 37:37.221
capability done about those small conventional 
wars? Not one damn thing.

37:42.107 --> 37:58.328
So it's become obvious that what the hell we wanted 
to do and what we had to do and what we still got to

37:42.107 --> 37:58.328
work on very hard to keep this force together. And 
we'd just gone through Korea where we'd been

37:59.405 --> 38:17.442
pushed and shoved around all over the place

37:59.405 --> 38:17.442
because of the total depleting of our capability 
while Eisenhower was Chief of Staff of the Army.

38:20.745 --> 38:28.872
And now here he is, President, and he's continued 
to move to destroy his own damn service.

38:32.733 --> 38:36.739
Well, you can understand why I have no regard for 
him whatsoever.

38:39.763 --> 38:50.860
And to have a sick president keep me from going to 
Berlin, as far as I'm concerned, Eisenhower had a

38:39.763 --> 38:50.860
major role in that. In 1945? In 1945. And it had been 
a different world today.

39:00.735 --> 39:02.217
Much a different world today. And so how did you, 
and so the interest of the Army, and did Secretary

39:04.424 --> 39:11.873
Stevens support you? Brucker. Brucker by this 
time, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Secretary Brucker.

39:19.843 --> 39:25.430
Secretary Brucker, one of the great civilian 
supporters. When it came around to, when the

39:25.490 --> 39:33.840
budget, when Eisenhower found his budget had been 
changed, Certain things cut out and other things

39:34.293 --> 39:39.040
added, military wise. Yeah, because of your 
dealings with Congress? Absolutely. Okay. Tell

39:49.535 --> 39:51.017
me about some of those dealings.

39:53.781 --> 40:03.895
Well, many of those dealings went on at

39:53.781 --> 40:03.895
night in dark alleys and in dark restaurants. And 
budgets were looked at, and this cut out, and money

40:05.849 --> 40:16.340
added here and there, and this weapons added in and 
on and forth. And this was with the Center for Armed

40:16.560 --> 40:20.404
Services Committee members? This came about 
through the good judgment and the desire of people

40:20.685 --> 40:34.219
who could understand and believed in what we were 
trying to do in the authorization area. And one of

40:35.414 --> 40:49.057
the great supporters was a young man who had the 
know-how when we got around to finding out if the

40:35.414 --> 40:49.057
civilian side could do this. A young senator who I 
admire and respect forever and ever. I went to him

40:58.752 --> 41:05.201
and said, sir, you know what we're trying to do, and 
you believe in what we're trying to do. Can you

41:05.321 --> 41:13.011
contact the civilian side or call them in to find 
out whether or not industry can support this sort

41:05.321 --> 41:13.011
of thing? And he said, I'll do it. His name was John 
F. Kennedy. What a hell of a guy. And, of course,

41:21.263 --> 41:26.650
he's the guy that proved off for me being— Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Mr. McNamara.

41:35.890 --> 41:45.483
He could have, Mr. Kennedy could have asked Mr. 
McNamara to put a civilian in there if he had wanted

41:35.890 --> 41:45.483
to, but he didn't do that. So, Mr. McNamara would 
have forged, and Mr. Hitch Mr. Ignatius, Mr. Tom

41:57.224 --> 42:14.226
Morris, all of those were involved indirectly, 
unbeknownst to them, I think.

42:19.252 --> 42:24.919
But I thought Mr. McNamara's first move after the 
Army diddled around for so long, he personally

42:26.688 --> 42:41.962
selected General Ham Howes, who was here in Fort 
Worth, to head up the Howes Board and start moving

42:26.688 --> 42:41.962
in the direction in which these colonels had been 
working. And we got the Air Cavalry Division and

42:41.982 --> 42:46.185
all that. Magnus Meyer personally did that over 
the head of the Army Chief of Staff, because the

42:46.966 --> 42:54.973
Army Chief of Staff at that time was a man named 
General Decker, who was a great hell of a golf

42:56.135 --> 43:01.044
player. He could build a hell of a golf course, and 
he was one hell of a fine guy, but let's just leave it

43:01.725 --> 43:10.161
right there. Okay, well let's go back now to 1956. 
So in other words, you were building

43:14.149 --> 43:19.138
congressional support. for the type of army that 
you thought was necessary.

43:27.484 --> 43:39.621
You must have had a number of generals, even though 
it's called the Colonel's Revolt, you must have

43:27.484 --> 43:39.621
had a number of generals in the Pentagon who 
encouraged you or supported your efforts. Sure

43:39.701 --> 43:40.141
did. Maxwell D. Taylor

43:41.824 --> 43:48.653
was interested in a strong army. I'm not going to 
say that he participated in the Colonel's revolt

43:49.375 --> 43:54.482
because as far as I know, he didn't. And neither did 
Dental Ridgeway. But they must have talked to you.

44:00.750 --> 44:04.776
They talked to everybody about what we needed in 
the way of an army. But they are hereby at

44:05.597 --> 44:18.454
the presidential selectees

44:05.597 --> 44:18.454
as a three-star general is. You serve in a 
four-star. Now, by law, Title X, U.S. Code, the

44:22.282 --> 44:32.716
highest grade you can attain is major general. 
That's by law. However, the president may select

44:35.600 --> 44:42.009
for a one assignment only. The president may 
select people for promotion to three-star and

44:47.037 --> 44:49.760
four-star. They're selected for only that 
assignment. At the end of that assignment, they

44:53.844 --> 45:06.797
have to go back to the grade of major general unless 
the president so selects him for another

44:53.844 --> 45:06.797
three-star slot. Unless that three-star slot 
that he selected you for, at the time you leave this

45:06.817 --> 45:16.167
three-star billet, If that three-star bill is 
still occupied, even in transit, you revert back

45:17.176 --> 45:25.988
to a major general. And the same is true with a 
four-star. So, the three and four-stars are at the

45:28.712 --> 45:39.808
pleasure of this particular assignment of the 
president.
