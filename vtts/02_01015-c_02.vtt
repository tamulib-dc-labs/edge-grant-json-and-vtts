01:28.338 --> 01:55.712

Till the time we have is gone together Watch the

01:56.485 --> 02:22.071

memories

01:56.485 --> 02:22.071

Try to set the night

05:20.048 --> 05:49.735
on

05:20.048 --> 05:49.735
fire The time to hesitate is through No time to 
wallow in the mire

05:51.335 --> 06:17.578
Try now we can only lose And our love becomes a 
funeral pyre Come on baby light my fire Come on baby

05:51.335 --> 06:17.578

06:32.915 --> 06:50.113
No time to hesitate it's through No time to wallow 
in the mire Try now we can only lose And our love

06:32.915 --> 06:50.113

07:07.373 --> 07:18.598
fire

07:07.373 --> 07:18.598
come on baby light my fire

08:05.913 --> 08:12.041
How can people be so heartless?

08:12.061 --> 08:14.625
How can people be so cruel? Easy to be hard.

08:20.412 --> 08:23.717
Easy to be cold.

08:27.221 --> 08:31.667
How can people have no feelings? How can they 
ignore their friends easy to be proud?

08:50.918 --> 09:15.154
who care

08:50.918 --> 09:15.154
about strangers who care about evil and social 
injustice do you only care about the bleeding

08:50.918 --> 09:15.154
crowd how about a needing friend

08:50.918 --> 09:15.154
how can people be so heartless

09:18.188 --> 09:20.916
Can people be so cruel? Easy to give in.

09:26.192 --> 09:27.777
Easy to help.

09:33.562 --> 09:45.976
Especially

09:33.562 --> 09:45.976
people

09:33.562 --> 09:45.976
who care about strangers, who care about evil and 
social injustice. Do you only care about the

09:45.996 --> 09:51.442
bleeding crowd? How about the needing friends?

09:56.167 --> 09:59.130
How can people be so heartless? How can people be so 
cruel? Easy to give in.

10:10.219 --> 10:16.106
Easy to help

10:10.219 --> 10:16.106
out. Easy to be

10:16.367 --> 10:21.993
hard. Easy to be

10:22.013 --> 10:27.279
hard. Easy to be hard.

11:03.472 --> 11:22.358
Life goes on and we pass through Days of sunlight, 
days of tears Live the way life comes to you

11:03.472 --> 11:22.358
Foolish, wasting, precious years Life goes on, 
one day you cry Then your laughter fills the air See

11:22.912 --> 11:50.083
the winter paint the sky Feel a moment of despair

11:22.912 --> 11:50.083
One

11:22.912 --> 11:50.083
day you trust in love The world exists for you One 
day you trust no more And then the world will

12:01.724 --> 12:11.768
Days of sunlight, days of tears Live the way life 
comes to you Foolish, wasting, precious years

12:31.492 --> 12:59.727
One

12:31.492 --> 12:59.727
day you trust in love The world exists for you One 
day you trust no more And then the world turns blue

12:31.492 --> 12:59.727
Life goes on and we pass through Days of sunlight, 
days of tears Say

13:00.685 --> 13:20.736
goodbye and

13:00.685 --> 13:20.736
life goes

13:00.685 --> 13:20.736
on.

13:38.603 --> 13:49.576
What are you doing the rest of your life? North and 
south and east and west of your life.

13:56.425 --> 14:00.930
I have only one request of your life. That you spend 
it all

14:10.463 --> 14:34.463
All the seasons and the times of your days

14:10.463 --> 14:34.463
All the nickels and the dimes of your days Let the 
reasons and the rhymes of your days All begin and

14:10.463 --> 14:34.463
end with me

14:39.218 --> 15:06.002
I want to see

14:39.218 --> 15:06.002
your face in every kind of light In fields of dawn 
and forests of the night And when we stand before

14:39.218 --> 15:06.002
the candles on a cake Oh, let me be the one to hear the 
silent wish

15:11.602 --> 15:35.331
Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes In the 
world of love you keep in

15:11.602 --> 15:35.331
your eyes I'll awaken what's asleep

15:11.602 --> 15:35.331
in your eyes It may take a kiss

15:47.309 --> 16:01.251
Summer, winter, spring and fall

15:47.309 --> 16:01.251
of my life

15:47.309 --> 16:01.251
All I ever will recall

16:17.768 --> 16:19.442
See you.

17:01.070 --> 17:15.095
Yesterday,

17:01.070 --> 17:15.095
when I was young, the taste of life was sweet as rain 
upon my tongue. I teased the life as if it were a

17:15.215 --> 17:19.623
foolish game. The way the evening breeze may tease 
a candle flame. The thousand dreams I dreamed, the

17:26.264 --> 17:49.015
splendid things I planned I always built, alas, on 
weakened shifting sand I lived by night and

17:26.264 --> 17:49.015
shunned the naked light of day And only now I see how 
the years ran away When I was young So many lovely

17:50.142 --> 18:13.939
songs Were waiting to be sung So many wayward 
pleasures Lay in store for me And so much pain My

17:50.142 --> 18:13.939
dazzled eyes refused to see I ran so fast the time

18:16.433 --> 18:45.765
I never stopped to think what life was all about and 
every conversation I can now recall concerned

18:16.433 --> 18:45.765
itself with me and nothing else

18:16.433 --> 18:45.765
at

18:16.433 --> 18:45.765
all. Yesterday the moon was blue And every crazy 
day brought something new to do I used my magic age

18:46.505 --> 19:08.361
as if it were a wand I never saw the waste and 
emptiness beyond game of love i played without a

19:09.100 --> 19:32.307
glance and pride and every flame i lit to quickly 
quickly die the friends i made all seem somehow to

19:09.100 --> 19:32.307
drift away and only i am left on stage to end the play 
there are so many songs In me that won't be sung I

19:32.692 --> 20:02.243
feel the bitter taste Of tears upon my tongue The 
time has come for me To pay for yesterday When I was

19:32.692 --> 20:02.243
young

19:32.692 --> 20:02.243
Yesterday When I was young So many lovely songs 
were waiting to be sung. So many wayward pleasures

20:08.269 --> 20:12.542
lay in store for me. And so much pain my dazzled eyes

20:23.823 --> 20:28.916
So many lovely songs waiting to be sung. So many 
wayward pleasures laying store for me. And so much

20:33.990 --> 20:39.404
pain my darkened eyes refused to see. Yesterday.

20:59.058 --> 21:28.558
I

20:59.058 --> 21:28.558
know your leaving's too long

20:59.058 --> 21:28.558
overdue For far too long I've had nothing new to 
show

21:37.600 --> 21:45.990
Then it

21:37.600 --> 21:45.990
felt so strange

22:29.609 --> 22:38.607
Thank

22:29.609 --> 22:38.607
you.

23:00.524 --> 23:11.935
And it

23:00.524 --> 23:11.935
felt

23:00.524 --> 23:11.935
so strange.

23:42.712 --> 24:10.491
Again

23:42.712 --> 24:10.491
Say goodbye Again Our friends have tried To turn my 
nights to day

24:15.398 --> 24:26.477
Strange faces in your place can keep the ghosts 
away.

24:26.497 --> 24:37.896
But just beyond the darkest hour, just behind the 
door, it still feels so strange.

25:41.967 --> 26:09.814
Since

25:41.967 --> 26:09.814
you've been gone I'm feeling blue I think of me, I 
think of you So many things we used to do together

25:41.967 --> 26:09.814
Feeling the way I do today I can remember yesterday 
You said that we would always stay

26:10.773 --> 26:37.506
together

26:10.773 --> 26:37.506
I walk the city streets

26:10.773 --> 26:37.506
alone Cold as the coldest city stone Go to

26:10.773 --> 26:37.506
the places we have known together I tell myself 
that nothing stays the same

26:59.153 --> 27:22.157
in the night i call your name dreaming that you are 
back again no one is there to ease the pain without

26:59.153 --> 27:22.157
you

26:59.153 --> 27:22.157
maybe it's faith we had to part sorrow is sweet so 
when we start meeting again you know my heart i love

26:59.153 --> 27:22.157
you

27:37.460 --> 27:48.054
I see the faces stop and stare in every window 
everywhere. Oh, how I wish that we were there

27:48.074 --> 27:52.199
together. What has been done is dead and gone. 
Can't we forget nobody else we want? Isn't it time

27:57.486 --> 27:58.067
for us to

28:05.472 --> 28:07.737
Nothing stays the same.

28:32.810 --> 29:01.990
¶¶

29:34.420 --> 29:40.345
Fairy tales were always

29:34.420 --> 29:40.345
true. Every face was filled with laughter. Every 
day brought something new. Summertime seemed to

29:51.855 --> 29:56.880
last forever. Friends would come and friends 
would go. But their war would always linger In the

30:03.968 --> 30:31.478
days when time ran

30:03.968 --> 30:31.478
slow Make the world

30:03.968 --> 30:31.478
a

30:03.968 --> 30:31.478
little younger Let the laughter in Yesterday was 
filled with

30:40.756 --> 31:10.138
Make

30:40.756 --> 31:10.138
the world a little

30:40.756 --> 31:10.138
younger We're a happy face When the

30:40.756 --> 31:10.138
world's a little younger Life's a brighter

30:40.756 --> 31:10.138
place When the world was a little younger there

31:12.278 --> 31:33.173
was time for going fishing and the games we used to 
play

31:12.278 --> 31:33.173
make the world

31:44.273 --> 31:45.239
Thank you.
