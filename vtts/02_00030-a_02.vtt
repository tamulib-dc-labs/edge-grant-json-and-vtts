WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:17.028
Because during the day, she was tired because she 
got up early and go into her room, and if the bottom

00:02.377 --> 00:17.028
bunk was not occupied, that's where she spent the 
day or the half a day. And she took up with the band

00:18.110 --> 00:20.976
first. And that happened when she was in the 
basement of Leggett Hall in a room they called a

00:21.412 --> 00:29.021
trunk room. That's where the two veterinarians 
kept her. And all the freshmen were detailed to

00:32.405 --> 00:38.251
bring food out of the dining hall and feed her. And 
she meant it and got to feeling pretty good. And

00:44.398 --> 00:49.444
when the band played for Riverleaf Formation, at 
breakfast one morning the door was cracked wide

00:49.863 --> 00:54.189
enough for her to come out. So she did and went and 
joined the band. And it was a little difficult I

00:57.914 --> 01:03.342
think for her because it was tough on her ears. So 
she stayed with the band about three weeks and

01:03.362 --> 01:08.409
didn't have anything to do with anybody else. But 
from then on she was everybody's puppy. Now, I had

01:12.234 --> 01:17.642
heard the legend that she would start barking at 
Morning Reveille. Is that a myth? I don't

01:20.919 --> 01:21.720
remember. She might have while the band was 
playing. I think it was because it was difficult

01:24.282 --> 01:28.587
for her ears. Was there any administrator who gave 
official approval to Reveille being in the

01:29.608 --> 01:40.219
dormitory? I guess not. The Commandant agreed 
with it. And she had the full run of all the

01:46.208 --> 01:50.313
dormitories after she quit the band. Right. Now, 
what always has surprised me is that somebody

01:50.873 --> 02:00.043
didn't try to get another dog or a cat or something. 
Was there ever any other? No, nothing ever on the

02:01.905 --> 02:09.674
campus except during Mr. Rutter's time he had a 
bulldog. I remember that one. Ranger. Ranger. And

02:14.940 --> 02:20.385
I think he's buried out there somewhere pretty 
close to the President's house. But Ranger did not

02:21.226 --> 02:27.892
intercede or interfere with Reveille's 
territory. Let me add this little anecdote about

02:29.334 --> 02:32.256
Reveille. This is soon after the MSC expansion 
project is completed. And I'm in the downstairs

02:39.331 --> 02:48.421
kind of snack bar having a Coke, and here come some 
two or three A&M cadets with revelry. And the fella

02:49.542 --> 02:53.126
in charge of the snack bar did not have an A&M 
background. And I hear him yell, get that dog out of

02:54.087 --> 02:56.209
here. Nobody pays any attention. And he yells out 
again, get that dog out of here. And again, they

03:03.136 --> 03:04.518
just keep on. Finally, he says, I done told you, get 
that damn dog out of here. And he's walking over to

03:08.862 --> 03:18.292
these sophomores with the dog, and he told them, 
and they said, sir, this ain't no dog. He said, what

03:18.632 --> 03:20.013
do you mean this ain't no dog? He said, this is 
Reveille. No, I had not heard that. Was it the

03:25.139 --> 03:29.643
original Reveille or the one of the college? Oh, 
no, this would have been 1972 or three. Oh, one of

03:33.227 --> 03:34.208
the college. Oh, yes, yes. But this guy didn't know 
anything about A&M tradition and he had no idea

03:35.069 --> 03:39.654
what this was. What did he do then? Oh, he backed 
away. I said, sir, this dog goes anywhere. Well,

03:47.322 --> 03:57.593
she did and she made a lot of friends and was 
friendly with everybody. Was there ever, with

03:57.613 --> 04:00.216
that first dog, Was there any effort by somebody 
to, quote, train her, or did she just kind of come by

04:00.382 --> 04:08.792
her behavior naturally? She'd come by nature

04:09.193 --> 04:20.627
to go with formations and do what everybody else 
did. If there was anybody that ever trained her, I

04:23.686 --> 04:24.927
was not aware of it. But she was very friendly and 
was everybody's friend. None of the Brewer bred

04:32.895 --> 04:40.842
dogs they've had since then, I don't think, have 
ever been as smart as she was. And she was, there'd

04:40.862 --> 04:52.933
been some veterinarians made research trying to 
figure out what her breed was, and they come to one

04:40.862 --> 04:52.933
conclusion, it was a Heinz 57. Did anybody ever 
have any information about where she might have

04:53.707 --> 05:00.998
come from, whose dog it was? No. They thought 
possibly that somebody dropped her out of a car to

05:03.001 --> 05:08.990
get rid of her. That's when she got run over. How was 
it decided who would take the first Reveille home

05:10.833 --> 05:18.525
the first summer? I do not remember that. She might 
have just stayed on the campus. But it was your

05:23.710 --> 05:25.933
outfit? No, it wasn't anybody. There was no outfit 
responsible for it. Well, no, but who, in whose

05:31.641 --> 05:37.268
room, wasn't there somebody that kind of took care 
of her? No, she just retired wherever she decided

05:38.069 --> 05:44.638
at night. It would be on somebody's bottom bunk if 
it was an empty bunk somewhere. But that's the only

05:50.355 --> 05:57.570
way you could get out of your bunk, and the best 
thing to go find the empty bunk yourself and leave

05:50.355 --> 05:57.570
her alone. By and large, did she move from room to 
room, bunk to bunk? Oh, just never know where she'd

06:03.782 --> 06:06.087
be at night. Let's see, in your outfit, what was it? 
G, infantry. Did it have a nickname? Huh. Y'all

06:12.923 --> 06:15.486
didn't have a, I thought every outfit had a 
nickname. If it did, I don't remember. We had two

06:18.709 --> 06:35.466
regiments, A, B, C, and D, and E, F, G, and H. 
Describe a typical class day in terms of what did

06:18.709 --> 06:35.466
you wear and what kind of behavior was expected in 
the classroom. Well, in the classroom, I don't

06:36.273 --> 06:48.223
know of a professor that did not demand perfect 
behavior, and everybody wore their uniforms.

06:48.608 --> 06:51.532
What uniform were you all wearing in those days? It 
was khaki in the summer and wools in the winter.

06:58.682 --> 07:07.414
But the professors were very firm about their 
conduct in the class. Now, there were a few of them

07:07.554 --> 07:11.319
would vary from it, but not much. But everybody 
knew who would accept this and who wouldn't. Who

07:15.825 --> 07:18.008
were, as you think back, on your student days, 
particularly your freshman, who were some

07:18.612 --> 07:27.083
faculty members that had an effect on you and your 
future life? I don't remember any in particular,

07:29.005 --> 07:35.874
probably, unless it was John Paul Abbott, who died 
a few years ago. He had the reputation of being one

07:35.894 --> 07:42.222
of the best freshman English teachers we had. And 
Dr. whose son's an attorney in Bryan now, was

07:45.342 --> 07:49.549
another favorite. What were their nicknames, 
according to the students? Well, Cofer was Dusty,

07:53.656 --> 08:00.327
but I don't think John Paul had a nickname. Dusty 
Cofer was all he's ever known. I thought there was a

08:02.571 --> 08:05.135
second word in his nickname. I thought it was D.B. 
as in Dusty Butt. Well, it might have been. Might

08:09.863 --> 08:11.586
not have been to his face. Didn't every faculty, 
almost every faculty member have a nickname? No,

08:16.063 --> 08:19.067
not every one of them, but quite a few of them. We had 
a history professor that you could hear clear

08:19.107 --> 08:25.996
across the campus screaming Al Nelson. And that's 
the only one I recall. When did you get your

08:29.100 --> 08:30.662
nickname? I got it playing basketball. Here? 
Here. And the story was that If somebody wasn't

08:42.903 --> 08:49.352
doing a good job on defense, I passed them so fast 
they felt a breeze. And then after I got too old to

08:49.553 --> 08:54.880
play basketball, I never quit talking.

08:57.784 --> 09:02.031
But basketball is a different story. The freshman 
coach and the varsity coach meant an awful lot to my

09:02.992 --> 09:08.139
life, too. Who were they? Clepto Holmes, who was a 
football assistant, I think, taught physical

09:09.262 --> 09:15.731
education. And when we signed up for physical 
education, you had your choice of sports. Well,

09:22.121 --> 09:34.138
all I knew was basketball and track, and I didn't 
want to play with track during the winter on the

09:22.121 --> 09:34.138
outside, so I signed up for basketball and went to 
his basketball class. And just before he started

09:35.975 --> 09:44.866
working out for freshman basketball, they had a 
freshman team that was not eligible for the

09:35.975 --> 09:44.866
varsity. And he stopped me at the end of a PE class 
one day and busied a little bit and said, where did

09:45.787 --> 09:55.198
you play high school basketball? And I told him and 
he said, how long? I said, well, I've had a

09:58.482 --> 10:05.070
basketball in my hand since it was big enough to 
throw it through a hook on the side of a barn. And he

10:06.164 --> 10:20.222
said, well, I've watched you here in P.E., and I 
think you've got enough ability that I'd like to

10:06.164 --> 10:20.222
have you on my freshman squad, and we're going to 
start working out Monday at a certain time. And I

10:20.663 --> 10:25.409
said, well, is it going to conflict with my P.E. 
class? And he said, no, you come out from freshman

10:26.070 --> 10:32.999
basketball, as long as you stay on the squad, you 
don't have to come to my P.E. class. So that was my

10:34.328 --> 10:46.431
beginning of basketball, and we played ten games 
against local schools. got a basketball enumera,

10:46.732 --> 10:51.319
which was a gray sweater with a 35 in a circle. And 
then

10:52.742 --> 11:02.858
the basketball coach expected everybody that was 
on the face team to join him next year, which I did.

11:02.878 --> 11:08.267
And he was Coach John Reed. was in about his second 
or third year here. I believe he came in 29 and

11:12.534 --> 11:18.463
resigned at the end of my senior year. He played at 
North Texas and had been to Baylor. And the squad

11:24.151 --> 11:27.697
was small. We only had seven lettermen my 
sophomore year. And I was fortunate enough to be

11:33.345 --> 11:36.330
one of those two sophomores. And we didn't have my 
three years on the varsity, we did not have but one

11:37.492 --> 11:43.789
scholarship. A boy named Joe Merker was about 6'3 
or 6'4 from Bryan High School and made Allstate the

11:45.440 --> 11:53.829
year before in his senior year. And everybody in 
the conference wanted him as a player. So they gave

11:59.335 --> 12:05.061
him a scholarship to stay at home to keep having to 
play against him. And that's the only scholarship

12:05.081 --> 12:07.504
that was given. The rest of them were walk-ons. We 
had two or three guys that would come help us in

12:10.127 --> 12:14.772
basketball. from the football squad after 
Thanksgiving, and one of those was General Ray

12:14.752 --> 12:23.487
Murray, who was a two-star Marine general. Our 
correspondent was still living in Oceanside,

12:24.869 --> 12:29.437
California. Now, you played what position in 
basketball? Center and forward. And you're what

12:33.925 --> 12:35.347
height then? Six-two. Six-two. And were there any 
much taller players in the conference? Oh, yeah,

12:41.991 --> 12:43.072
quite a few players. We had one player of our own 
that was 6'5", but his shoulders were narrow and I

12:43.112 --> 12:51.123
could not reach him on the wall because of the 
length of my arm. And I was a substitute center

12:52.364 --> 12:58.132
during Joe Mercer's day. He was one class ahead of 
me. And I might have not made the squad that first

13:00.989 --> 13:08.096
year if it had not been for him getting the flu. We 
took a five-day trip during the Christmas

13:09.138 --> 13:26.676
holidays, played independent and AAU teams, and 
he'd give us about three days to go home Christmas

13:09.138 --> 13:26.676
and come back after Christmas and get ready for the 
first game, first weekend in January for the

13:09.138 --> 13:26.676
conference. And he'd already posted the list on 
the bulletin board of the people who were going to

13:26.656 --> 13:35.785
make the five-day trip my sophomore year. And 
after practice, he called me to the office. In his

13:41.310 --> 13:54.182
slow, bold language, he said, Breezy, I don't 
think you're qualified to go on this trip. But Joe

13:55.343 --> 14:02.311
has had the flu, and I believe I better take it. So 
where did you all go? First night we went to Stephen

14:03.773 --> 14:06.336
F. Austin. No, first night we went to Beaumont and 
played a town team. Second night we went to play

14:12.123 --> 14:18.330
Stephen F. Austin with a guy named Bob Shelton who 
was a great friend of mine. And Joe wasn't feeling

14:19.542 --> 14:25.407
too well, and so he started me at center. And 
started me at center. And second quarter, he put

14:29.971 --> 14:36.316
Joe to play until he got tired, and I finished up for 
him. So we had about a quarter and a half each half

14:37.157 --> 14:48.807
during that game, because he just didn't have the 
strength. and they had an all-conference center

14:48.787 --> 15:07.251
and I outscored him and kept him under control my 
part of the game and we went on to East Texas and

14:48.787 --> 15:07.251
played an independent oil team called Hunt Oilers 
and they had two or three players from the Athens

15:07.231 --> 15:11.535
High School National Championship. And then I 
think we played Sunday. We played four nights in a

15:14.738 --> 15:16.280
row. And so we come back home, and he said, after all 
of this, I'm glad I decided to take you. So I made a

15:28.351 --> 15:31.554
letter on my sophomore year. All right, so your 
sophomore year, then you're on the varsity track.

15:37.083 --> 15:41.050
Yeah, varsity track, but nothing but high jump 
after basketball was over. Describe Coach

15:41.891 --> 15:45.417
Anderson as a person, as a human being. Well, 
there's never been a more dedicated coach in my

15:45.457 --> 16:00.542
lifetime as far as looking after his athletes and 
training them and having the desire for them to do

16:01.484 --> 16:04.106
their very best from the time come.

16:07.430 --> 16:11.093
I just thought he did awful well, and he did. He 
helped me change my form after basketball my

16:11.133 --> 16:15.837
freshman year. We didn't have many six-foot 
jumpers, but I was one of a few six-foot jumpers

16:18.400 --> 16:24.706
that we had. But we never could do very well in dual 
meets and conference meets because Texas Usually

16:30.391 --> 16:34.876
carried five people that were better than 
six-foot jumpers. And he would not start his

16:35.937 --> 16:40.702
starting lineup. He wouldn't, the track coach, 
Littlefield, would not decide who was going to

16:42.184 --> 16:51.094
enter until he watched the warm-up. Then he'd 
designate the three. And I had my last session with

16:53.937 --> 16:58.862
him when I was a senior. in the conference track 
meet. You had to have 11 points in dual meets to get a

17:02.627 --> 17:07.993
letter. Well, I had nine, and went to the 
conference meet in the Orenby Stadium in Dallas,

17:08.013 --> 17:19.245
and there was about 20 some odd people. Started out 
in the high jump, got to one certain height, I don't

17:19.285 --> 17:29.457
remember, probably a little less than six feet, 
and then wheeled them down to six people. And you

17:31.158 --> 17:36.825
had three trials, three opportunities to make it. 
And for 18 consecutive tries, all six of them

17:37.326 --> 17:44.815
knocked it three down. So we had six people tied for 
11 points. So you divide that and got one point and

17:49.901 --> 17:54.747
six tenths. Five, six. And that gave me a letter my 
senior year. Otherwise, I'd never beat those

17:58.892 --> 18:05.560
Texas guys because they were better jumpers. But 
it was a cool day, and they just weren't at their

18:05.580 --> 18:09.105
best. And Colonel Landy did a lot of things to help 
you train when you were away from the track. What

18:18.509 --> 18:21.196
were some of his rules? Well, he didn't have a rule. 
He just had a suggestion that your body needs more

18:22.881 --> 18:32.046
water than most people give it, so you drink a pint 
of water before you go to breakfast. and a pint of

18:32.566 --> 18:34.428
water when you come back. I had a pint container in 
my laboratory. And I did it and said, it'll keep you

18:38.693 --> 18:46.221
regular and it'll help your digestive system and 
this, that, and the other. And I ended up top

18:47.323 --> 18:59.036
working some pecan trees for him before he died in 
his yard, as well as some for his son, who was an

18:47.323 --> 18:59.036
ophthalmologist. I've interviewed Rusty. 
Rusty. In fact, I taught Rusty in two seasons to

19:01.793 --> 19:09.589
graft himself. And that's an interesting story, 
but it doesn't have anything to do with this. I

19:16.845 --> 19:20.292
worked with him on one full afternoon. And after 
about four or five trees, I put the apron on his neck

19:20.626 --> 19:28.413
and said, now you get the next one. He said, Breezy, 
do one more because I haven't been paying

19:29.396 --> 19:32.948
attention. So I did one more and went through about 
13 steps with him. And he did it from his own, from

19:39.269 --> 19:43.553
then on. In fact, the last two years he worked, he 
didn't even invite me to go with him. But he was a

19:48.978 --> 19:51.861
personal friend. In fact, before he retired, he 
gave me a longhorn heifer that I still have. All

20:00.229 --> 20:03.812
right, so you were a varsity track. and 
basketball, three years each. And the only

20:08.287 --> 20:16.317
financial benefit from that, in terms of a 
scholarship-like, was your dining hall job. And

20:18.139 --> 20:22.384
you graduated in how many, in four years, I'll tell 
you? In four years. I got a little behind some of my

20:23.545 --> 20:33.377
work my sophomore year because I wanted to be a 
mechanical engineer because I had a lot of

20:23.545 --> 20:33.377
mechanical ability. But I did not have the math 
background to pass calculus. So Dean Bolton was

20:38.499 --> 20:43.347
the dean of engineering, and he called me in after 
the first semester. And he had a son also that was in

20:44.448 --> 20:48.194
my class. And he said, you're doing well in 
athletics, but you're not doing very well in

20:49.316 --> 20:55.626
calculus. And if you're going to continue your 
athletics, I believe you ought to change courses

21:00.627 --> 21:11.369
and get out of engineering, because it required 
sophomore two classes of calculus. And I never

21:11.429 --> 21:21.370
could understand why, unless a professor got, 
because I had, in freshman math, I had two As. But I

21:22.362 --> 21:29.880
could not pass calculus, so I changed to 
industrial education and ended up as a teacher and

21:22.362 --> 21:29.880
a coach. But he said, you got to side on one. And I had 
to go to summer school one summer to make up for what

21:40.064 --> 21:41.846
I was behind. And that was after camp, I believe, my 
junior year, my junior ROTC camp. And it was during

21:50.954 --> 21:54.617
that summer semester when I met my bride. We'll 
talk about that later. But

21:57.740 --> 22:08.890
both of the men, Klepto and John Reed and Frank 
Anderson, have meant an awful lot in my life. So

22:09.899 --> 22:14.749
that you didn't have any classes with them, but in 
fact they were teachers. That's right. Teachers

22:16.192 --> 22:17.975
in a lot of different ways. Let's see, who were some 
other, in those four years, who were some other

22:20.200 --> 22:29.899
teachers, advisors, that were, as you look back, 
were important to you? Well, there was one

22:30.132 --> 22:37.562
gentleman I thought an awful lot of, his widow 
still lives here, Dave Fleming. He taught

22:39.425 --> 22:47.536
elementary woodwork, advanced woodwork, and 
pattern making, and had all three of the courses

22:39.425 --> 22:47.536
under him. In fact, I have a few pieces of furniture 
scattered around that I made in his class. And he

22:56.569 --> 23:01.054
was a very, very outstanding professor. And I had 
an awful good professor in 309 and 310 ME Machine

23:02.156 --> 23:16.393
Shop, Walter Downard, that had a lot of industry 
experience but didn't even have a degree. And then

23:17.975 --> 23:20.558
there was John Abbott, Offhand, I don't recall 
many others. Who did you call? My military science

23:26.255 --> 23:32.982
instructors were all very interesting, 
particularly my junior year. We had a Colonel

23:34.523 --> 23:44.172
Alfonte who retired at Camp Creek that was my 
junior military science teacher. And he had no

23:44.192 --> 23:49.397
time in his career did he ever keep a class longer 
than 30 minutes. He got his lesson plan covered and

23:51.014 --> 23:54.885
covered what he wanted to. And he never missed a 
day's basketball practice before or after. And

24:02.528 --> 24:04.433
one day he come. stopped me at the end of a class and 
said, I need to visit with you about something. And

24:10.175 --> 24:16.504
he gave me a piece of chalk and he said, diagram that 
new play you all put on yesterday afternoon. And

24:16.564 --> 24:19.529
said, I didn't quite understand it. And I'm going 
to see if you use it the next game. And he was a very,

24:23.735 --> 24:27.881
very interesting basketball fan. Colonel 
Delamater was my senior advisor and he had a son

24:29.083 --> 24:33.930
that Followed them in the military here. I don't 
remember who my freshman was. Captain Lyons was my

24:41.623 --> 24:43.567
sophomore. But they were here for a different 
purpose. If you needed advice, to whom did you

24:47.934 --> 24:52.782
turn? If you needed somebody to help you 
understand something, a personal matter, who

24:52.803 --> 24:58.332
would you turn to?

25:01.687 --> 25:02.528
I don't know. To look back on it, I believe I would 
talk to any one of my current coaches. Because they

25:09.355 --> 25:17.364
knew about our welfare was very important. In 
those days, the YMCA was an important activity

25:17.384 --> 25:21.209
center. What kinds of activities at the YMCA did 
you attend? Just sometimes some of the socials or

25:25.413 --> 25:34.444
religious services, some kind like that. Mr. 
Cashin was the first advisor at YMCA, and then

25:34.944 --> 25:41.712
Gordon Gay. Gordon was superintendent of Sunday 
school at Methodist Church for 25, 30 years, and

25:42.974 --> 25:52.365
they had a real good program. Did you go to any 
religious activities as a student? Well, I went to

25:56.277 --> 26:05.708
what's now the Wesley Foundation students at A&M 
United Methodist Church, and so did my brother. He

26:06.589 --> 26:13.617
was on the, I think they called it the Wesley 
Foundation cabinet. And the day they took a

26:13.637 --> 26:22.707
picture of my senior class group, for some reason I 
was absent. I wasn't in the picture. But Spike

26:24.644 --> 26:31.491
White, who owns these eight camps in Bronson, 
Missouri, is in the picture. And I sent him one of

26:31.931 --> 26:38.638
those 50-year church books not too long ago with 
his face circled. And he wrote me back and said, I

26:39.519 --> 26:44.924
sure do appreciate that and how much they owe you. 
And I have my answer to this letter. But that

26:47.247 --> 26:53.773
50-year book was written by Mr. Bryson, who's one 
of the greatest people who ever put his foot on a

26:47.247 --> 26:53.773
camp. Describe the A&M Methodist Church physical 
facility at that time. Well, our beginning was in,

27:02.601 --> 27:12.235
and I think when I left here, we were still in that 
wooden tabernacle. Then we were gone 10 years and

27:12.383 --> 27:17.898
come back and they were building the sanctuary. So 
the wooden tabernacle was right where the

27:17.979 --> 27:21.990
sanctuary is now? No, it was between the sanctuary 
and the classroom. They had a sanctuary, and then

27:27.385 --> 27:35.635
they built a classroom behind it, and then moved 
the old tabernacle and joined the two buildings.

27:37.037 --> 27:53.376
Because we were here, we come back in 45, we left in 
35, come back in 45, and we're in on the

27:37.037 --> 27:53.376
groundbreaking of the new sanctuary. And you had a 
good picture of that dedication in the 50-year

27:53.356 --> 27:59.403
book. But that was the first year we were back. 
Describe, during your undergraduate days,

28:02.808 --> 28:10.157
describe what was at Northgate. The only thing I 
remember to Northgate was

28:10.177 --> 28:16.765
Luke's Grocery Store. which is right next to Lou 
Potts now, and Northgate Barbershop. That's all I

28:25.228 --> 28:26.329
remember. There was no movie theater? The Shulman 
Campus Theater wasn't there yet? I don't believe

28:31.994 --> 28:32.955
it was. What else went on at the YMCA? I think there 
was a tailor shop down there. I forget now the name

28:39.421 --> 28:40.742
of it. Ludicare, I believe. What else was there? 
What other events happened at the YMCA?

28:49.094 --> 28:50.335
I don't recall. They had

28:51.277 --> 29:06.034
an open ear for anybody that wanted to talk about 
their religious problems and had certain

28:51.277 --> 29:06.034
activities.

29:07.356 --> 29:09.518
Was there a religious emphasis week then? I don't 
believe so. There might have been. If there do, I

29:12.342 --> 29:13.583
don't remember. Was it common for your classmates 
to go to a church religious activity on the

29:14.255 --> 29:21.708
weekend? Some of them. Never been to one, never 
has, and probably never will, and some whatever

29:22.830 --> 29:28.721
weekend. Let's discuss in current definition the 
word diversity. What diversity was there in the

29:34.350 --> 29:36.975
student body then? Did you know some boys that were 
Catholics? Yeah, unless you just accidentally

29:40.141 --> 29:50.592
found out, sometimes you never did know what the 
religion choice was. Were there some Jewish boys

29:51.193 --> 29:52.494
here? Yeah, we had a few Jewish boys. How were they 
treated? Same as all the rest of them, as far as I

30:00.042 --> 30:02.445
recall. That's the answer I thought you would 
give. Were there any international students?

30:08.515 --> 30:08.855
Yes. The international students during the time I 
was here lived in what we call in PG, postgraduate

30:09.677 --> 30:21.880
hall, which is a wooden building behind where 
Walton is now. And they were all housed together.

30:26.369 --> 30:28.693
They wore khaki uniforms during the warm days and 
the wool uniform, just like a regular cadet, had

30:30.428 --> 30:47.745
AMC on one side and an E&M for non-military on the 
other side, and they gathered as a group. on the

30:47.725 --> 30:55.698
side of the street by the Aggieland Inn, and they 
went to the dining hall and ate after everybody

30:47.725 --> 30:55.698
else had gone in. That was all international 
students. I don't recall any of them living off

31:00.145 --> 31:02.548
campus. Do you have any recollection of what part 
of the world they were from, primarily? No, never

31:07.977 --> 31:14.948
did have an opportunity to be very close to any of 
them. might be having one in class next to you but i

31:15.333 --> 31:22.238
don't remember where they were from i didn't have
