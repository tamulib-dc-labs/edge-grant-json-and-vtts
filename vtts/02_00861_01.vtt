WEBVTT

00:01.415 --> 00:05.502
August 22nd, if it don't rain anymore. Right. And 
it's about four to two in the afternoon, and we're

00:06.063 --> 00:13.938
talking with William H. Cook. C-double-O-K-E.

00:18.206 --> 00:18.386
Right. Okay, and you became editor and publisher 
of the Rockdale Reporter in 1936, didn't you?

00:24.297 --> 00:24.537
Right, yeah. And you were born in what year? 1907. 
Here in Rockville? No, I was born in Clarendon, up

00:30.505 --> 00:36.253
in the Panhandle. In Clarendon? I didn't see them 
in town. I left there at a very early age,

00:40.138 --> 00:45.185
apparently. My father was So about how old were you 
when you came

00:48.040 --> 01:01.676
to Rockdale? So I came, when we came to Rockdale in 
1912, I would have been five years old. I'm not

01:12.627 --> 01:17.273
exactly sure how long we lived in Clarendon after I 
was born. It was apparently not very long. And then

01:19.496 --> 01:21.398
we moved to Brady and lived there. And left there in 
1912 to come to Rockdale. So you were five years

01:27.185 --> 01:29.128
old? I was about five, yeah. Do you remember the 
mine disaster? I guess you were about six years

01:33.753 --> 01:35.075
old. Well, you know, I remember it the way a child or 
a kid remembers things. in his older age. I heard a

01:45.356 --> 01:57.273
man say once that the older I get, the more I can 
remember about my boyhood, but I can't remember

01:45.356 --> 01:57.273
what happened the day before yesterday. And I 
haven't quite reached that stage yet. Because

02:01.459 --> 02:07.768
there's a whole lot of things that I can remember 
vaguely about my boyhood. And I do remember the

02:08.549 --> 02:11.473
mines. Did your dad talk about the mines very much? 
There was not a great deal of talk about the mines.

02:17.468 --> 02:23.657
You know, they were just there, and it was kind of, I 
mean, everybody's used to them being there.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.080
They've been there for a long time. They seem to 
have been a peripheral sort of thing to Rocky.

02:29.607 --> 02:29.967
Yeah, right. Would you agree with that? Right, 
they were. And they were way out there, four or five

02:32.571 --> 02:39.081
miles or more from town.

02:40.360 --> 02:55.601
I remember more about those old mines from later 
years after I was in high school and out of high

02:40.360 --> 02:55.601
school when we used to go dove hunting, quail 
hunting, and walk across there. That was after the

02:55.621 --> 02:57.243
mines were gone. And those old sinkholes and 
things, you know, we could see evidences of the

02:57.784 --> 03:03.652
mines. I remember that really more than I remember 
the mines. I remember that last week myself,

03:07.397 --> 03:09.540
haven't you? Well, that's very important, some 
important information that we need, because what

03:09.858 --> 03:20.930
years would your high school years have covered in 
post-high school years, exactly? Yeah, well, let

03:20.950 --> 03:26.215
me see, I must have graduated, I was such a smart 
little devil. I graduated when I was 16. I believe

03:32.121 --> 03:33.183
that's right. I graduated in 1922.

03:39.507 --> 03:45.236
Okay, and were the mines shut down by that time, or 
most of them? Oh, yeah. Yeah, they were shut down by

03:45.957 --> 03:48.500
then. Just when I was a kid, the mines were out 
there. But by 1920s, they weren't operating. Now,

03:56.673 --> 04:04.444
there was the Johnny Boniva mine operated a good 
while out there after all the rest of them had shut

03:56.673 --> 04:04.444
down. That and the strip mining. And the strip 
mining came in, uh-huh. Johnny Boniva, that

04:09.190 --> 04:12.756
Johnny Boniva mine. I don't know whether Johnny 
bought that or fell heir to it or what, but I knew him

04:13.798 --> 04:18.666
real well. Well, why don't you tell me something 
about him? And he made a pot full of money out of that

04:20.729 --> 04:22.793
mine. It was kind of a one-man operation. I mean, he 
ran it, and it was his mine. And he was a young fellow

04:28.963 --> 04:33.831
around here, and... That mine, I don't remember 
now, it either sold, either sold it or closed it. I

04:42.502 --> 04:58.218
probably closed it because the demand for lignite 
coal after the arrival of natural gas became so, so

04:42.502 --> 04:58.218
low that, you know, it wasn't, there just wasn't a 
market for it anymore. Well, according to the

04:58.238 --> 05:04.864
newspaper, it changed hands around 1930 or 31, but 
John Boniva maintain its superintendent status.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.968
And what I haven't been able to find yet is when it 
actually shut down. Yeah, well, no, I wouldn't be

05:12.328 --> 05:16.695
able to tell you that either. Well, did you ever 
make any trips to the mine? Not really, not really.

05:22.784 --> 05:30.115
The only trips I ever made to the mine area was when I 
was just a small kid riding a donkey. And as I told

05:30.135 --> 05:33.180
you once before, A lot of us boys on Saturday 
afternoons and Sundays, we'd get a few nickels and

05:33.886 --> 05:43.324
we'd get on our donkeys and ride out there to the 
commissary. It seemed like that soda pop and

05:43.484 --> 05:50.337
nickel candy out there tasted a whole lot better 
than what you bought in town. Probably a long

05:50.357 --> 05:51.739
donkey ride out there. Yeah, but if somebody 
invited any of us to go down in one of those shafts,

05:57.106 --> 05:58.969
We'd have probably been scared to death. We'd have 
run from pride. I don't think I would have gone down

06:00.652 --> 06:03.317
in one of them. I'm not so sure I'd like to go down in 
one now. Myself, I feel the same way. I'm sort of

06:08.766 --> 06:10.569
glad they're all closed up. But when you did go out 
there, if you could possibly remember, did you go

06:11.511 --> 06:20.667
through the mining camps where the Mexicans 
lived, or did you skirt around them? No, we never

06:21.271 --> 06:23.855
did really visit in them. Those mining camps, it 
was just row after row of houses, little wooden

06:24.496 --> 06:33.710
shacks that they lived in. They all looked just 
alike. But no, I don't ever remember. They were off

06:39.358 --> 06:49.894
to the right of the dirt highway that we traveled 
out there at that time, south of the railroad

06:39.358 --> 06:49.894
track. And I can remember seeing them over there, 
but I don't know that I ever went over and around

06:51.106 --> 07:00.016
those towns. We went out to the mines and just poked 
around and played, you know, like kids will do. Did

07:07.765 --> 07:11.970
the Mexican families come to Rockdale that often? 
Or was there an interchange of the two areas? I kind

07:14.613 --> 07:15.994
of have an idea. No, the Mexicans came to Rockdale 
and traded. about like the farmers came to

07:20.654 --> 07:24.380
Rockdale and traded back in the old days. They came 
in wagons and traded on Saturday. That's about the

07:29.468 --> 07:33.835
only day farmers came to town in those days. Now you 
notice with highways and automobile, farmers

07:34.456 --> 07:42.308
come to town and trade every day, but At that time, 
I'm pretty sure that those Mexicans, they came to

07:44.431 --> 07:53.646
town once or twice a week, and you know, when they 
bought groceries, they stocked up on them. They

07:53.666 --> 08:01.359
put it in the big supply from the old-time grocery 
stores before they had the cash and carry, you

07:53.666 --> 08:01.359
know. And of course, they did an awful lot of their 
buying. Their needs, they bought from the

08:05.045 --> 08:09.612
commissaries or the company store. Could you sort 
of sum up in general terms what the attitude of

08:10.908 --> 08:20.842
Rockdale was toward the mines themselves and the 
Mexicans? Well, I think the attitude of the

08:21.784 --> 08:28.814
Rockdale people towards the mines and the Mexican 
people was good. We were proud of having the mines

08:30.196 --> 08:33.801
out there. It meant quite a bit to the town. You can 
tell that from reading your paper. And as far as the

08:38.680 --> 08:44.366
Mexicans were concerned, no, they were just some 
old people out there working in the mines. And we

08:45.528 --> 08:50.754
enjoyed a good relationship with them, and they 
did with us.

08:52.897 --> 08:57.022
Yes, I don't see the... Civil rights and human 
rights hadn't been heard of then. Right. Yeah, I

08:59.545 --> 09:01.587
don't see the conflict... between the Mexicans 
and the Anglos that you do between the blacks and

09:02.528 --> 09:07.755
the Anglos earlier on. Yeah, that's right. And 
even the Anglos and the whites and the

09:10.278 --> 09:22.414
American-Americans or the Chicanos, which 
somebody said a term had just been invented the

09:10.278 --> 09:22.414
last ten years. All right, I have a feeling it's the 
few Spanish people, the young people that have

09:22.795 --> 09:31.506
gone to college and picked up that term because I 
found that the... Other people around here don't

09:31.840 --> 09:34.262
use that term. They use Latin, or they use Spanish, 
or they use Mexican, which has been educating to

09:34.322 --> 09:42.029
me. But actually, as I remember the minds out 
there, they were just, I'm not just exactly sure

09:43.491 --> 09:54.961
that Rockdale citizens thought about them as 
being an industry. They were proud of them. They

09:58.344 --> 10:00.126
meant good business for the town, and they were 
good for the town, but they don't think of them as

10:00.359 --> 10:12.700
being an industry like we think of Alcoa as being 
the industry now, or in that fact. Can you give any

10:12.800 --> 10:15.425
reason for that? Well, if they were just so, they 
were just so established, they'd been there, and

10:15.465 --> 10:25.101
you know, it just, I mean, they were just there, and 
that was it. And they just sort of faded away. And it

10:27.608 --> 10:36.860
wasn't until the years after that that small towns 
became conscious of industry and trying to get

10:27.608 --> 10:36.860
industries into the small towns.

10:39.604 --> 10:47.634
In those earlier days,

10:39.604 --> 10:47.634
that just wasn't too big a thing. And I think the 
people of Rockville took the mines kind of

10:48.736 --> 10:54.143
matter-of-factly. That's the attitude I've been 
getting. I think that's right. We were proud of

11:00.382 --> 11:04.127
them. And they were under control of the Texas 
Bureau of Mines. And a man named Bruce Gentry, who

11:10.276 --> 11:23.494
lived here in Rockdale, was the chairman of the 
Texas Bureau of Mines all his life, I guess. Well,

11:23.695 --> 11:25.497
Indian Bullock came in. And then Bullitt came in 
after him. After him, right. And E.A. Camp was also

11:29.507 --> 11:32.010
a member of the board. He was a member of the board. 
Right, so all three of those men were from

11:33.492 --> 11:36.415
Rockville. The mines had a fairly decent accident 
record. It was below the average in the United

11:43.383 --> 11:46.126
States. They really did. I can remember that one 
big cave-in after that rainy season, and I can

11:48.749 --> 11:54.876
remember that later, a few years later, of some 
coal burning under the ground out that side. You

12:03.023 --> 12:18.130
could see for a period of several months, you could 
see smoke coming up just out of the ground over a

12:03.023 --> 12:18.130
long area south of the railroad track out there, 
but it eventually just smothered itself out, and

12:03.023 --> 12:18.130
they did have a low accident rate. especially 
considering how crude the equipment was in those

12:19.949 --> 12:31.842
days as compared to what, gee, if somebody would 
start putting in a shaft mine out there in that area

12:19.949 --> 12:31.842
now, it'd be a big deal. It'd be a much different 
technique. Oh, yeah. Well, Mr. Cook, were you

12:37.288 --> 12:48.541
familiar with any of the, I don't know what word to 
use, intrapreneurs or capitalists that

12:37.288 --> 12:48.541
randomize, like Sharp or E.B. Phillips? I knew, 
yes, I knew all those men. They were all

12:53.124 --> 12:56.047
businessmen in Rockdale. And Henry Meyer, H.C. 
Meyer, was the mayor of Rockdale for years and

12:56.068 --> 13:05.839
years and years, and a big, you know, a big Rockdale 
booster. And E.B. Phillips was connected with the

13:08.562 --> 13:16.872
same hardware firm that Mr. Meyer was, the old 
Henny and Meyer store here. He was also the funeral

13:16.936 --> 13:19.018
director. And the funeral director. He was in 
charge of that department of the hardware,

13:20.039 --> 13:28.167
furniture, and funeral directing. It was a big 
story. It was the Henney and Meyer firm. They also

13:35.554 --> 13:43.382
had the same sort of a business in New Braunfels, 
and Henney, H-E-N-N-E, was in New Braunfels then.

13:43.987 --> 13:44.988
Oh, I didn't know that. And Meyer lived up here, 
uh-huh. And they had the same kind of an operation

13:46.430 --> 13:51.137
in your Broncos back in those days. Well, 
generally, you know, talking about the men that

13:52.178 --> 13:59.628
owned the mines and ran the mines, were they local 
people? Or were the mines run by outside capital?

14:03.313 --> 14:08.660
No, I think most of those particular mines out 
there were all local. And there was a Sparks.

14:11.678 --> 14:12.659
Right. Do you remember anything about Dr. Sparks? 
I just, not really. I just remember him, and I

14:17.305 --> 14:38.732
remember the family, and remember, you know,

14:17.305 --> 14:38.732
but that was before I got big enough to be 
interested in how businesses and mine were run.

14:39.877 --> 14:50.733
One thing I noticed that was kind of odd was that the 
Mexican people have two basic celebrations at

14:39.877 --> 14:50.733
least each year, Cinco de Mayo and the 16th of 
September. Cinco de Mayo was the big one. Was it? Do

14:52.796 --> 14:53.978
you remember any of those? Did you go to any of them? 
I don't think I ever went to one, but I heard an awful

14:55.360 --> 14:59.185
lot about them. And there was publicity in the 
newspapers about them. And the Mexicans like to

15:03.792 --> 15:09.360
celebrate. the 5th of May. That was a big day for 
them. Do you know, did it affect Rockdale at all?

15:16.890 --> 15:18.973
Did they come in to buy supplies? I imagine it 
probably did. I don't know, but I expect it

15:21.798 --> 15:30.149
affected business to a certain extent prior to the 
celebration. They had to get ready for it. But

15:34.035 --> 15:38.942
mostly they kept pretty much to themselves and 
their celebrations were They were out there among

15:39.698 --> 15:43.083
themselves. Well, I noticed, looking over 37 
years in your newspaper, the last couple weeks,

15:43.864 --> 15:53.298
that July 4th has always been a big celebration. 
Big celebration here, out at Fair Park. Would the

15:57.083 --> 15:59.987
miners and their families come in for that 
celebration? Well, now that, I imagine, started

16:00.007 --> 16:05.074
after the mining days. Yeah, after the mines 
closed down. Remembering that the mines closed

16:09.787 --> 16:19.455
down in the early to mid-20s, do you know what the 
miners and their families did after they shut

16:09.787 --> 16:19.455
down? No, I don't. No, I don't. But the shutdowns 
out there were gradual, you know. One mine, then

16:27.122 --> 16:29.784
later on another mine. And it wasn't just like an 
industry closing up and leaving town. I see. So it

16:36.050 --> 16:37.871
was throughout the 20s. Yeah, right. Were you 
familiar with any of the physicians that worked

16:39.588 --> 16:46.756
out of the mines at all? Were any of them your 
friends? I probably knew most of those physicians

16:48.558 --> 16:53.184
at that time. There were three, Dr. Wallace, Dr.

17:03.836 --> 17:06.939
Sessions, Dr. Coulter. I expect they were all here 
at that time. But did they ever talk to you about

17:12.771 --> 17:15.274
having to go out there? No, no. That's been one hole 
in the in the story so far. No, I never did but I'm

17:19.079 --> 17:25.467
sure they did and they traveled in horse and buggy 
at that time. Of course I guess by the 20s they had

17:26.388 --> 17:29.332
their own cars. I imagine, yeah. So when was the 
model he invented? Okay, so you're asking a

17:35.579 --> 17:39.964
historian a question he should be able to answer. 
No, I don't even know that myself.

17:44.889 --> 17:47.552
Some of those early 1920 papers, I believe. Oh, 
well, it was before then. I think the first one came

17:49.634 --> 17:55.321
to Rockdale about 1915, maybe a little earlier. 
Probably so. And some of the miners themselves had

17:56.862 --> 18:01.347
them in the 20s. They were able to save up enough 
money to purchase them.

18:08.722 --> 18:22.881
But

18:08.722 --> 18:22.881
you would say that after the mines were shut down 
that the Mexicans would come in for the July 4th

18:08.722 --> 18:22.881
celebrations? I'm sure they did. I noticed you had 
county fairs quite often. The county fair in

18:29.770 --> 18:36.079
Rockdale way back in the early days was an enormous 
a celebration. They had big fairs on there at that

18:37.803 --> 18:44.090
time, which was before the July 4th celebration. 
Actually, the July 4th celebration probably came

18:44.110 --> 18:56.543
into being after World War I, and most of them were 
sponsored by the American Legion. And every year

18:57.424 --> 19:00.548
they got just a little bit bigger. But prior to 
that, quite a few years prior to that, was when the

19:06.248 --> 19:10.555
old Rockdale Fair was in all its glory. The streets 
weren't paved here, they were dirt streets. And

19:14.561 --> 19:23.255
they had parades with floats, you know, on wagons 
drawn by teams of horses and mules. I remember

19:23.275 --> 19:24.917
reading descriptions of that. Yeah, and they were 
big events, I tell you. Daredevil airplane

19:30.346 --> 19:33.031
riders. I remember that. I remember when one 
crashed out there when I was a kid. Yeah, they were

19:39.624 --> 19:44.293
quite disappointed when that happened.

19:46.216 --> 19:47.759
They didn't get to see the air show. Right. They 
were more concerned about that than they were.

19:52.756 --> 19:57.060
than he was a pilot of that plane, I think, although 
I don't believe he was hurt critically. No, but he

19:57.080 --> 20:00.103
did refuse to go back up again. He enjoyed about as 
much of that as he could stand for the day, I think.

20:06.870 --> 20:13.456
What do you think, do you think Lignite is finally 
going to make a bigger impact on Rockville? Oh yes,

20:13.636 --> 20:15.598
no doubt about that. What would you attribute that 
to? Well, every year now, the demand for energy has

20:23.688 --> 20:31.318
been showing up more and more, and lignite's 
becoming more and more prominent now. And Alcoa

20:32.139 --> 20:39.148
has been generating their own electricity out 
there with lignite fuel ever since 1952. And

20:39.548 --> 20:48.539
that's because lignite was out there is the reason 
Alcoa is here. And there right now, building this

20:52.055 --> 20:57.863
addition to the power plant, which was more than 
double its size. And that will...

21:05.434 --> 21:09.039
They've got a three-unit power plant they built in 
1952. I remember writing publicity about that at

21:09.139 --> 21:18.012
the time, and we had pictures of it, and they said it 
was large enough to furnish It confers enough

21:18.683 --> 21:27.617
power for six cities the size of Austin at the time 
it was put into production out there. Well, since

21:27.637 --> 21:30.001
then, Austin has grown quite some. And also, the 
aluminum smelter has more than doubled in its

21:30.782 --> 21:38.635
production and size. And the demand for 
electricity and power has just gone up and up and

21:39.596 --> 21:46.547
up. Of course, out there they used a strip mining 
technique, whereas the early lignite mining was

21:47.995 --> 21:53.100
shaft. Yeah, that's the early lignite mining was 
shaft mining. Well, I'm wondering what the

21:57.125 --> 21:59.828
economic difference is. I mean, back in the early 
days, you did have Mexicans coming into town to buy

21:59.888 --> 22:06.194
clothes and nothing else. So you did have, you 
know, money coming in. Right, but that was the

22:09.438 --> 22:14.323
number of Mexicans working in the mines. was just 
insignificant as compared to the number of people

22:14.793 --> 22:23.463
working out here, even just in the mines, in the 
strip mining. There's more people working in the

22:23.743 --> 22:26.726
strip mine now than there were? Yeah. It's a far 
bigger operation than all the old shaft mines put

22:27.127 --> 22:32.252
together. I see. So technology came in with the big 
strip mining shovels, but it also brought more

22:35.856 --> 22:42.724
jobs.

22:46.957 --> 22:52.225
And with the addition of this power plant now, 
they're increasing. TP&L and Alcoa are building

22:52.305 --> 23:00.497
this new power unit as a cooperative venture. 
They're both involved in it. And of course Shell is

23:03.802 --> 23:06.967
here too. Yeah, but of course they're a separate 
identity. They're on their own. They're coming in

23:14.513 --> 23:20.240
and making plans to start a new strip mine 
operation. And they don't know just what they're

23:20.260 --> 23:28.390
going to do with that lignite that they mined yet, 
but they're hoping to find what they call a mine

23:20.260 --> 23:28.390
mouth customer. And I think that will mean quite a 
bit to this area. Well, do you think the nature of

23:35.719 --> 23:42.748
Rockvale is going to change with Alcoa expanding 
and Shell coming in here? We will remain pretty

23:43.049 --> 23:46.492
much the same. We'll grow. I think we're in for some 
real growth. I think I don't believe the future

23:54.681 --> 23:59.746
ever looked any better for Rockdale and does right 
now. Well, do you think you'll lose some of the

24:00.406 --> 24:04.090
rural town flavor? I noticed the other day at 5 
o'clock it took me two or three lights to get

24:04.471 --> 24:08.334
through. And I just had the feeling that that was an 
unusual... thing at least 10 or 20 years ago. Oh

24:15.155 --> 24:21.381
yeah, there weren't any traffic lights in those 
days, but the streets were terrible. So with the

24:22.903 --> 24:25.085
bad you get the good. Yeah, that's right. Because 
Rockdale will grow and I think our business

24:27.668 --> 24:31.932
district will grow. When Alcor came in in 1951, 
from that time until now, When they came in, our

24:38.213 --> 24:42.017
population was just a little over 2,000. And now 
it's, I would guess, a conservative estimate

24:42.478 --> 24:50.788
would be between 6,000 and 7,000. But our business 
district hasn't grown in proportion to the

24:51.929 --> 24:58.797
population. I think with the new development in 
the next six or eight, ten years now, there will be

24:58.817 --> 25:07.647
more business growth. You said Brown and Root is 
also in the area now? Well, they're building,

25:10.829 --> 25:19.642
they've got the contract to build that fire plant 
for TPNL and Alcoa. I see. First of all, they'll

25:21.445 --> 25:23.748
come in and then they'll leave, right? Yeah, 
right. Their target date for completion of that

25:25.050 --> 25:28.495
plant is 1981. So they'll be here until. Well, what 
kind of a shock will that be to Rockville once they

25:33.843 --> 25:37.228
leave? When the Alcoa construction was over in 
1951, we went through pretty much the same thing,

25:38.103 --> 25:49.520
you know. A big industry hit a small town all of a 
sudden, and the impact was terrific. And, you

25:54.987 --> 26:00.896
know, we had hundreds and hundreds of 
construction workers in here for several years.

26:00.916 --> 26:07.165
We'd have several, I think, construction workers 
on this brown roof project. will peak at about 500

26:07.398 --> 26:35.228
but as the plant gets into operation the mining 
activities will increase and there'll be more

26:07.398 --> 26:35.228
employment there to take up some of that slack and 
about that same time Shell has plans for starting

26:07.398 --> 26:35.228
its strip mining operations which which will just 
be getting started when when this quits so for

26:07.398 --> 26:35.228
another period of another three to five years they 
will There'll be some construction activity

26:36.035 --> 26:43.486
followed by new industrial and mining activity. 
That's the way it looks to me right now. Well, if we

26:45.989 --> 26:49.875
jump back in history just a little bit, I'm trying 
to see if there are any parallels. Maybe there is,

26:49.975 --> 26:51.897
maybe there isn't. And I realize that you would 
have only been about eight years old, or even

26:51.917 --> 26:58.667
younger. Between 1910 and 1920, for instance, 
generally in Texas there was a great migration of

26:59.002 --> 27:10.515
Mexican workers to Texas because of the 
Revolution. Do you remember any sort of impact

27:11.115 --> 27:14.599
that had on Rockdale? Not really, no. No, I really 
don't. Because from all the time we had a lot of

27:18.523 --> 27:24.570
Mexicans working in the mining area out there. And 
I suspect that after the mines closed and the

27:25.681 --> 27:37.376
Americans, I think just like the old fellow 
Morales you're talking about, he moved to town. So

27:39.519 --> 27:41.822
most of them, when the mines shut down, they did 
move? And a lot of them, I think, moved in town and

27:42.063 --> 27:53.798
got jobs, or they went out on a farm and farmed, or 
maybe they left somewhere

27:42.063 --> 27:53.798
else. But they were just kind of absorbed in the 
flow, the ebb and flow. There wasn't any pressure

27:58.724 --> 28:05.293
then on Rockdale's charity organizations to take 
care of them? No, no. That's unusual. Well, it

28:08.318 --> 28:11.983
would be today. In those days, it wasn't. Well, one 
thing I've noticed, Mr. Cook, is that Up north,

28:19.900 --> 28:25.326
they had company town situations, you know, the 
old Coleman car company town. And the situation

28:26.328 --> 28:31.193
here in Rockdale seems much more progressive than 
that town. I mean, here in Rockdale, they paid

28:31.213 --> 28:33.596
cash. The Mexicans could move around from mine to 
mine. And up north, they were paid in company

28:38.241 --> 28:40.684
script. They could not go into town to buy other 
things. Do you have any idea why people like Sharp

28:45.820 --> 28:51.727
and Sessions and Phillips developed a system like 
that? No, I don't. I think, I don't, I have an idea

28:52.828 --> 28:57.513
that it wasn't done intentionally. I think it 
just, I think it just happened. I think it's just

29:00.296 --> 29:02.499
one of those things that happened. Well, I wonder 
if Mr. Vogel, you know, Herman Vogel had anything

29:02.899 --> 29:07.444
to do with that. Well, he had, he bound to have had 
something to... to do with it, but he was one of the

29:12.871 --> 29:17.456
mine owners.

29:22.001 --> 29:29.468
That's something I'd like to be able to explain, 
you know, why it was a much more free-flowing, more

29:22.001 --> 29:29.468
progressive situation. Well, I really hadn't 
thought about it.

29:37.377 --> 29:38.558
I can see what you mean.

29:42.267 --> 29:48.976
Well, the fascinating thing is, as we said 
earlier, it was a peripheral sort of industry. And

29:49.096 --> 29:52.160
Rockdale is agriculturally oriented more. It was 
then more than it is now. There's very little

29:55.684 --> 29:57.486
agriculture there now. But you know, those mines, 
those Mexicans came in here gradually as the mines

29:59.769 --> 30:05.296
opened up. It wasn't like a big industry setting 
down like Alco did in 51. A mine opened here. A year

30:13.056 --> 30:16.780
or two later, a mine opened there. It was a gradual 
process, and then they closed the same way. And

30:21.205 --> 30:33.939
there wasn't any big influx or big outgo of that 
Mexican population at any time, I don't believe.

30:35.601 --> 30:38.464
But it was, do you think it was fairly fluid? I mean, 
you know, new people came in, and the people that

30:38.782 --> 30:46.774
were here left, or was it a sort of an internal 
growth, sort of? I think it was more of a kind of an

30:46.794 --> 30:50.399
internal growth than a family affair growth. You 
know, like the fellow Morales, he worked in the

30:52.883 --> 31:03.378
mines as a youth. His father worked in the mines, I 
feel sure, maybe his grandfather. and you know

31:07.672 --> 31:18.364
they they grew up these American miners their 
families grew the boys grew into the mine.

31:18.384 --> 31:21.628
Well I sure didn't want to thank you for your time 
can you think of anything else? I really no I really

31:21.788 --> 31:24.411
can't I wish I could. If you happen to run into you 
know an answer or a personal answer to why the

31:26.653 --> 31:36.885
Rockdale Ignite mine situation was more 
progressive you know I'd appreciate Well,

31:37.220 --> 31:44.817
I'll tell you one possible reason.
