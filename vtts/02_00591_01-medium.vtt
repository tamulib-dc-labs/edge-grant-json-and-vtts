WEBVTT

00:03.423 --> 00:06.463
and what you did and what you've done in the past.

00:58.655 --> 01:01.053
Okay, why did you join the Secret Service? What got 
you interested in it?

01:52.756 --> 01:54.143
I would go out.

02:28.970 --> 02:29.915
Yeah. What was your father doing? The county 
official.

03:05.909 --> 03:07.971
to get myself involved in the...

03:37.145 --> 03:41.553
Yeah,

03:37.145 --> 03:41.553
it really was. OK, now that you're in Dallas, what 
are you doing mainly with the Secret Service? Are

03:45.782 --> 03:51.272
you doing a lot of working with the bodyguards, or 
are you working more for the Treasury side of it?

06:05.105 --> 06:08.093
See, I don't do very much investigation really 
anymore, do you? Besides into the counterfeiting

06:08.815 --> 06:11.563
part of it. Oh, we have investigations of a lot of it 
this week.

06:52.557 --> 06:57.589
Washington,

06:52.557 --> 06:57.589
we are quite aware of all threats that come in 
against all protections.

08:12.427 --> 08:17.531
What has been your, what was like your biggest 
security problem that you've had, like that

08:12.427 --> 08:17.531
you've faced? Yeah.

08:43.696 --> 08:55.504
Then

08:43.696 --> 08:55.504
we went out to take a service off our squad and hire a 
few more agents. More specifically, in the area of

08:55.524 --> 08:57.869
intelligence gathering. And by doing that, then 
we have to have a law enforcement agency.

10:37.619 --> 10:42.802
How do y'all handle something like the incident 
with Sarah Jane Moore?

10:43.786 --> 10:44.288
I mean...

12:06.061 --> 12:19.762
Okay, you're talking about how you had to build up 
the force after the Kennedy assassination, but

12:06.061 --> 12:19.762
also with all the protests and stuff like that 
around the Vietnam War, just people rising up

12:06.061 --> 12:19.762
against establishment, youth revolts. Did y'all 
have any problems with that? Did y'all have to

12:21.605 --> 12:25.791
build up your forces because of that?

12:51.539 --> 12:52.734
Place it down. Now, base it.

14:29.633 --> 14:37.146
Were you with Nixon or anything when you had a lot of 
protests and marches and stuff like that?

15:13.542 --> 15:14.339
We always do.

16:01.197 --> 16:05.085
Were they, could you tell what the people, or who 
the students were? They're always talking about,

16:05.105 --> 16:17.952
you hear a lot about like the SDS and stuff, but were 
there, could you really tell if there was many of

16:05.105 --> 16:17.952
those, or if it was just mainly just, you know, the 
college students not liking, you know, what

16:05.105 --> 16:17.952
America was doing and stuff? We had, we would 
always have the SDS.

17:10.688 --> 17:17.797
Were there any particular universities or areas 
in the U.S. that caused more problems than others

17:10.688 --> 17:17.797
did? Believe it or not,

18:02.512 --> 18:04.758
Okay, just a little bit about the Watergate. I know 
you can't say much about it, but when the news first

18:04.838 --> 18:13.382
came out about the break-in, what was the reaction 
in the White House?

19:02.755 --> 19:03.485
All right.

19:59.168 --> 20:01.254
and everything went on, did it change? I mean, did 
it seem like it was getting a little bit more, you

20:01.274 --> 20:07.110
could tell it was more hitting home? Well, I guess 
so, because then everybody's

20:54.451 --> 20:55.383
We'll move on.

21:15.629 --> 21:18.118
Not really. He left.

22:11.097 --> 22:16.236
to

22:11.097 --> 22:16.236
China. And you can see that he did have . So as far as 
our end of the

22:45.826 --> 22:56.977
OK. OK.

22:45.826 --> 22:56.977
You've been with a lot of different kind of 
officials and stuff like that, and ones coming in

22:45.826 --> 22:56.977
from other countries. And have there been any 
customs or something like that for someone from

22:57.397 --> 23:08.067
another country that's kind of caused a problem or 
anything for you, security-wise?

23:10.890 --> 23:14.854
Well, I guess not that there's any problems, you 
find.

23:38.307 --> 23:58.748
It

23:38.307 --> 23:58.748
takes

23:38.307 --> 23:58.748
the commitment of five agents in order just to fill 
one spot on a protective detail around the clock.

23:58.768 --> 23:59.709
And of course, we do that on the 21-hour basis. So 
it's kind of difficult, like we call it. One time,

24:00.610 --> 24:02.592
we had called an assignment for a protectee that 
was en route to New York. She was on the airplane, so

24:02.612 --> 24:04.094
we had a couple of months together to do that. But as 
far as problems, I guess that we have not had.

24:50.684 --> 24:54.535
and he happened to pass away in the hotel room 
and...

25:23.000 --> 25:30.646
I know besides doing bodyguard work and stuff like 
that, you work with the Treasury and catching

25:23.000 --> 25:30.646
counterfeiting. Is there a big problem with 
people passing counterfeit money and stuff in the

25:30.666 --> 25:35.871
U.S.? Well, at times, at times it's a problem. But 
we, I think, I don't have any stats in front of me,

25:46.820 --> 25:52.585
but I do remember from fiscal year 1980 that we 
seized $55.3

26:13.186 --> 26:28.504
They ought

26:13.186 --> 26:28.504
to build a dime store or grocery store for a packet 
of cigarettes in pockets of change, not for 15

26:13.186 --> 26:28.504
years in jail. So they try to sell all of that. 
They're setting a billion dollars in the whack,

26:30.266 --> 26:34.291
and they'll sell it for 23 cents on the dollar, 
whatever they can get, depending on the quality,

26:30.266 --> 26:34.291
what they can work with. There is no honor for the 
thieves.

26:47.206 --> 27:03.583
I'd

26:47.206 --> 27:03.583
say a lot of it, yes. There's a lot of money that's 
counterfeited every year, but

27:17.868 --> 27:22.074
I bought $90

27:17.868 --> 27:22.074
for the groceries. $10 back, you know, it's like 
you've got all that money. Yeah.

27:32.310 --> 27:32.591
That is tough. That's usually how it hurts. What is 
the most common way people are doing it? Is it

27:37.398 --> 27:42.085
printing of money, or is it like the raised bills, 
or what? Well, the raised note, that's taking

27:46.842 --> 27:49.917
quarters off the patient on a 5, 10, or a 20.

28:17.217 --> 28:36.809
and

28:17.217 --> 28:36.809
we've had

28:17.217 --> 28:36.809
a lot of people arrested for a lot of burglaries and 
rapes and murders who don't think there's

28:17.217 --> 28:36.809
anything wrong with that unless they get caught 
doing it. But the same people feel that anyone

28:36.829 --> 28:39.614
counterfeiting our currency is definitely a 
violation. That's un-American, non-patriotic.

29:28.328 --> 29:34.778
Are there very many areas, is there any particular 
area in the United States that poses or that

29:57.843 --> 29:59.820
Where you have a lot of people, where you have a lot 
of counterfeits.

30:46.645 --> 31:06.827
We

30:46.645 --> 31:06.827
know it's a brand new bill, and we can tell that by 
our computers in Washington and our counterfeit

30:46.645 --> 31:06.827
divisions because we then judge that bill on its 
characteristics. And it's like a painting. All

31:07.547 --> 31:08.589
the flaws are in that bill we can identify. And the 
process of counterfeiting money is done on an

31:08.609 --> 31:11.792
offset printing machine, so the same flaws are 
going to repeat themselves. They

31:12.042 --> 31:30.621
can't change the serial number, so that's

31:12.042 --> 31:30.621
not an identifying characteristic as far as 
determining the counterfeit bill. So, if we have a

31:30.641 --> 31:37.408
brand new $50 counterfeit bill passed in Dallas, 
we can check our books and the computers and we can

31:30.641 --> 31:37.408
find out exactly if that bill has been passed 
anywhere else in the United States, where, and if

31:30.641 --> 31:37.408
the plant has been seen, that means the machines, 
the paper, the paint, any arrests, etc.

31:40.409 --> 32:01.131
million

31:40.409 --> 32:01.131
dollars

31:40.409 --> 32:01.131
for it when I sold it all to this guy. And we seized 
$900,000. We know that there's some money still

32:01.632 --> 32:03.013
out and this may be part of it. And that way we can 
determine what's happened in that area because it

32:03.033 --> 32:07.478
is possible for the counterfeit note to be carried 
by an innocent person for three or four months or

32:03.033 --> 32:07.478
months and passed innocently. And by knowing the 
origin of most of our bills, we can determine

32:07.498 --> 32:09.640
whether that might have been an innocent

32:15.813 --> 32:40.842
We had a case

32:15.813 --> 32:40.842
here one time where a brand new $50 note was passed, 
counterfeit, and the guy who passed at the liquor

32:15.813 --> 32:40.842
store said, I just got that in El Paso, and I must 
have got it at the grocery store or something, and

32:15.813 --> 32:40.842
he convinced us, and he was probably telling the 
judge, even though we knew that he was not, because

32:15.813 --> 32:40.842
it was the first time that bill had ever been passed 
based on what the landlord had told him. So we let

32:40.862 --> 32:42.824
him go about his business, but we put a tail on him, 
and we tailed him for three months. Later on,

32:42.844 --> 32:43.525
another bill was passed,

32:48.280 --> 32:55.776
So we were able to put four or five passes to get 
through that middle, and we finally, long story

32:48.280 --> 32:55.776
short, rested him in place.

33:04.160 --> 33:11.779
You're talking about the raise note bills and 
stuff that kids do or lots of young people do. Do

33:12.180 --> 33:15.588
they usually get away with that? Do a lot of people 
not tell? Well, it's very easy because

33:30.620 --> 33:38.388
value.

33:39.569 --> 33:51.522
You take a

33:39.569 --> 33:51.522
quarter off of any

33:39.569 --> 33:51.522
denomination and it'll still pass 100%. But you 
take that quarter and put it on a patient on a $1

33:51.542 --> 33:55.626
bill, let's say of a 20, two 20s, and turn it over, 
fold it in half, and pass it to a cashier at a busy

33:51.542 --> 33:55.626
checkout spot, fast food or grocery store. It's 
going to feel like genuine currency because

34:07.576 --> 34:19.260
But if it's been a sloppily job pasting, obviously 
you can see Scott's tape, but a lot of times you

34:07.576 --> 34:19.260
probably see money that's been Scott's tape back. 
Yeah. But one who looks at you, but in other words,

34:19.400 --> 34:24.150
George Washington belongs on, the portrait 
belongs on one dollar bill.

35:22.788 --> 35:24.343
Probation for the reaction time.
