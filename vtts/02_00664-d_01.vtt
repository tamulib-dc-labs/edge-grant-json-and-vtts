WEBVTT

00:04.823 --> 00:08.148
Right.

00:08.168 --> 00:08.748
I'm ready. This is Alan Vine speaking. Perhaps one 
of the most important things to talk about next

00:12.734 --> 00:26.833
that affected some of our business and certainly 
the kind of work I was doing was when Thrasher sank.

00:28.736 --> 00:31.219
This was in the spring of 1963, a

00:33.376 --> 00:43.085
most unfortunate

00:33.376 --> 00:43.085
event. Our

00:45.327 --> 01:02.944
ship,

00:45.327 --> 01:02.944
a real few hours after it sank, I believe it was Art 
Maxwell from ONR called me up. let me know what had

01:03.667 --> 01:05.989
happened. Our ship, the Atlantis that was 
Atlantis II that was on its maiden voyage, was

01:07.551 --> 01:22.426
operating up in the Gulf of Maine only about 50 
miles away. We were able to get it detoured, get

01:22.446 --> 01:30.214
hold of it and get it detoured over. and got 
messages off to that as

01:31.544 --> 01:46.699
to where the ship was, what kind of equipment was 
aboard, and what they might be able to do. And the

01:47.160 --> 01:52.185
ship was basically at his service in any way that he 
could use it. But meanwhile, it would go about

01:52.866 --> 02:00.994
doing oceanographic surveys of the area until 
told to do something else.

02:03.725 --> 02:10.852
There are several parts about the Thresher 
sinking which were important to oceanography.

02:12.053 --> 02:18.779
One, the whole oceanographic game had gotten much 
larger than it was during the war and after the war.

02:21.161 --> 02:22.963
It had gotten much more bureaucratic. 
Organizations had naturally gotten much more

02:24.284 --> 02:28.949
self-centered. Individuals had tended to get 
more self-centered. And many of us had commented

02:33.408 --> 02:43.164
on whether that spirit of cooperation that was 
exhibited during World War II would ever show

02:33.408 --> 02:43.164
again.

02:47.190 --> 02:50.515
Here at Woods Hole, it certainly did. We got calls

02:51.978 --> 03:01.052
from a great many places, for example, Bucky 
Buchanan NRL called up and said, you're the

03:02.534 --> 03:09.182
closest laboratory to the ship. We don't know what 
will happen, but it's almost certain that your

03:10.103 --> 03:15.949
place will tend to be a headquarters. I've loaded 
two trucks, 10-ton trucks up with equipment that

03:16.971 --> 03:24.279
you might be able to use, and it's on its way. A 
representative of the Texas National Guard

03:26.982 --> 03:32.288
called up and said, we understand you people are 
involved in the search, and some of it's being

03:32.892 --> 03:40.439
based out of Woods Hole. We want you to know the 
Texas National Guard has the following kinds of

03:41.300 --> 03:46.905
aircraft. Any of these are available at any time, 
any place, any job. This number will be a good 24

03:54.151 --> 04:01.718
hours a day.

04:02.795 --> 04:09.643
A taxi driver who was supposed to pick up a piece of 
apparatus in Boston and bring it down hadn't shown

04:02.795 --> 04:09.643
up in the two and a half hours. We were getting a 
little disgusted when he arrived at the

04:11.165 --> 04:15.410
laboratory. His taxi had broken down halfway down 
here, and he left to the side of the road and

04:15.450 --> 04:23.319
hitchhiked down with a package because he felt it 
was needed.

04:27.364 --> 04:32.430
This kind of cooperation went on throughout the 
Thrasher search. and by a great many people, a

04:32.748 --> 04:36.352
great many places. And it was one of the positive 
things that came out of the search. It made us all

04:41.377 --> 04:48.023
realize that

04:41.377 --> 04:48.023
when the crunch comes, people will cooperate.

04:52.007 --> 05:02.097
At a fairly early date, within a few days after the 
Thrasher sank and the Navy had appointed Captain

05:02.380 --> 05:05.987
Frank Andrews to be the on-scene commander.

05:09.173 --> 05:17.829
Frank called me up to see if I would join him 
basically as his technical advisor. He had been in

05:18.630 --> 05:25.603
the Submarine Development Group 2 in New London. 
which I want to say something else about later. I

05:30.109 --> 05:34.555
forgot that important place. And he wanted to have 
someone

05:34.575 --> 05:53.920
both as a technical aide and also someone who was 
sufficiently acquainted with the oceanographic

05:34.575 --> 05:53.920
community so that he would know where we could get 
more help. All of the laboratories that had ships

05:55.773 --> 06:02.343
converged on the area. This is not the place to try 
and describe the Thresher search, except to say

06:04.886 --> 06:20.970
that about five ships were involved 
intermittently from the laboratories. Each

06:22.688 --> 06:33.202
technique that was felt to be promising was 
whipped out, utilized as well as practical. And

06:33.482 --> 06:45.177
then when either those people got tired out or they 
lost their gear, why then another ship would come

06:33.482 --> 06:45.177
in to continue or try another technique. There are 
many lessons to be learned in that. in that

06:52.912 --> 06:55.775
unfortunate affair. After being on scene about 
two weeks,

06:57.237 --> 07:17.299
the Chief of Naval Operations set up a committee 
under Admiral Ed Steffen, who had been

06:57.237 --> 07:17.299
oceanographer of the Navy and had been a very 
important person in

07:19.338 --> 07:25.043
re-cementing the relationships between the 
oceanographic community and the Navy's

07:19.338 --> 07:25.043
oceanographic office.

07:32.991 --> 07:48.585
So I left the unseen part of the Thrasher search and 
went to Washington and joined in with a committee

07:32.991 --> 07:48.585
which varied from anywhere between 10 and 30 
people, depending upon the times, see what one,

07:50.185 --> 08:09.182
really to write up a plan and a set of 
recommendations for the Navy as to how the search

07:50.185 --> 08:09.182
should be conducted, the rescue should be 
attempted, salvage should be undertaken, and so

07:50.185 --> 08:09.182
forth, if such a thing happened again. This 
committee went on at rather full strength and high

08:10.904 --> 08:19.872
steam about two and a half months. And at least that 
much longer was taken in sort of writing it up and

08:26.272 --> 08:33.340
assembling it. The best people in the country that 
were knowledgeable in such subjects were brought

08:34.902 --> 08:42.671
together in that committee. And a rather 
extensive report was put out Unfortunately, most

08:49.433 --> 09:00.548
of that report was classified, because

08:49.433 --> 09:00.548
it had to do so much with submarine operations. But 
the general principles came out in a wide variety

09:00.708 --> 09:15.728
of reports by individuals who had attended the 
meetings.

09:19.589 --> 09:28.423
Bad days in Washington then was when we were at the 
Naval Gun Factory was the news that Kennedy had

09:19.589 --> 09:28.423
been assassinated. And like nearly all other 
activities and groups in Washington, one just

09:28.763 --> 09:41.243
kind of shook your head and went home for a while.

09:47.888 --> 10:04.027
Okay,

09:47.888 --> 10:04.027
let's start in here. One, to backtrack a bit in the 
late 50s, the Academy of Sciences under the

10:15.833 --> 10:26.784
chairmanship of Harrison Brown, had a third 
National Academy of Sciences Committee on

10:15.833 --> 10:26.784
Oceanography.

10:29.426 --> 10:38.535
Harrison had asked me if I would chair a panel on 
equipment, which ended up by being called the

10:29.426 --> 10:38.535
Panel on New Devices. And I had the very great 
pleasure of being chairman of that. being

10:46.158 --> 10:47.301
involved with that. And Harrison took the 
attitude that he wanted his panel chairman to—he

10:47.642 --> 11:00.032
hoped they would attend all meetings and that they 
would also feel free to cast votes on all problems

11:00.772 --> 11:09.485
in which they legally could. And he didn't want to 
run the committee in such a fashion that there

11:10.005 --> 11:16.655
would be votes in which it wasn't perfectly legal 
for them to do so. As an individual, this gave me an

11:18.498 --> 11:27.471
opportunity to work even more closely with with 
many fine oceanographers that I already knew very

11:29.408 --> 11:41.380
well, but it also permitted me to get acquainted 
with quite a few more oceanographers that I didn't

11:29.408 --> 11:41.380
know very well. This committee can be described a 
little bit as taking about, there were about 30

11:43.282 --> 11:55.315
three-day weekend meetings in which work was the 
was the general tenor and that usually included

11:55.784 --> 11:59.332
about two of those knights.

12:03.982 --> 12:11.599
That committee in which Harrison Brown did such a 
good job of keeping

12:16.068 --> 12:26.545
keeping his eye on the ball of not only what needed 
to be done, but also very much how it had to be

12:16.068 --> 12:26.545
managed and done. And he was as much interested in 
the congressional aspect of it as he was in the

12:26.605 --> 12:32.214
oceanographic aspect. In other words, the 
chairman's concern, to a large extent, was how do

12:33.015 --> 12:40.287
science and government work together.

12:43.777 --> 13:00.238
One of the more interesting and lovable people on 
the committee was Sumner Pike, who had been one of

12:43.777 --> 13:00.238
the original

12:43.777 --> 13:00.238
members of the Atomic Energy Commission. He came 
from an old fishing family up in Lubeck, Maine. And

13:05.764 --> 13:12.653
perhaps his stature and personality could be best 
described by saying that a couple of times I saw him

13:13.780 --> 13:39.130
sort of talk to Ewing and Revelle and Islin as 
though they were a little bit small boys, and he did

13:13.780 --> 13:39.130
it in such a lovely style that they took it just like 
nice small boys should take it.

13:40.966 --> 13:50.361
Sumner had a wealth of experience in politics, 
mining, fishing, and just human nature.

13:51.042 --> 14:00.778
Everybody on that committee, I think, felt that 
they probably learned as much from Sumner as from

13:51.042 --> 14:00.778
anybody else. But to get back to perhaps the more to 
somewhat the more technical points that I was

14:08.388 --> 14:11.893
involved with.

14:16.920 --> 14:34.665
The committee of about half a dozen people,

14:16.920 --> 14:34.665
Jim Snodgrass from Scripps,

14:16.920 --> 14:34.665
Jim Lipp, who was corporate head of corporate 
planning for Lockheed, kindly took membership

14:35.641 --> 14:44.731
because he thought it would be a very interesting 
thing to do. And while he was more used to working in

14:44.751 --> 14:58.367
millions rather than thousands,

14:44.751 --> 14:58.367
his good common sense and his larger perspective 
was extremely important. Bob Frosch was a member

14:59.348 --> 15:03.673
and Andreas Rechnitzer.

15:06.944 --> 15:30.707
The goal for that particular piece of chapter was 
to try and see what kind of equipments were going to

15:06.944 --> 15:30.707
be necessary and optimum to carry out 
oceanography, both at a larger scale and also with

15:06.944 --> 15:30.707
a great deal more finesse.

15:34.501 --> 15:42.594
Here was another place to inject the fact that 
ships were needed, a logical array of ships. There

15:44.938 --> 15:48.304
was a ship chapter, which I spent a great deal of 
time on. Also, the question of navigation was very

15:49.846 --> 15:54.634
important. And I would like to mention one aspect 
of that which is perhaps an example of how things

16:01.602 --> 16:05.666
frequently get done. It was well known that the 
Navy was operating with or working on a transit

16:08.269 --> 16:20.362
navigation system, which was classified. And oh,

16:20.382 --> 16:31.153
I can't think of the fellow's name from John 
Hopkins University, who did the primary work on

16:32.298 --> 16:36.845
that. But he came up to Woods Hole and gave a lecture 
on

16:36.925 --> 16:44.736
the principles of the system.

16:47.500 --> 17:01.461
And he felt very strongly that one might be able to 
make a much simpler transit navigational

16:47.500 --> 17:01.461
receiver if one was willing to put up with a 
correspondingly larger error. Well,

17:02.285 --> 17:13.176
oceanographers who didn't have very good 
navigation, and when you wander around a week or

17:02.285 --> 17:13.176
two in the fog, your navigation is almost 
non-existent, anything looked very good to us.

17:15.278 --> 17:23.425
The Navy Department officially wanted to have no 
real part of this. They felt that their prize

17:24.426 --> 17:29.271
people should be sticking on to the under their 
job. Not that they were really against it so much,

17:30.573 --> 17:34.437
but they wanted progress in their own field. What 
our committee conjured up was the following

17:36.399 --> 17:41.865
concept. We would write the director of each of the 
larger oceanographic institutions

17:43.126 --> 17:55.900
to see if they would be willing to commit a sum of 
twenty thousand dollars for an experimental

17:56.251 --> 18:07.550
navigational transit system in which there was no 
guarantee as to

17:56.251 --> 18:07.550
how precise it would be. There was no guarantee as 
to whether it would work at all. And there was no

18:12.499 --> 18:18.529
guarantee as to whether they would ever even get 
it.

18:21.023 --> 18:40.032
We sent this out, and in his usual exhilaration to 
move forward, Ewing had his letter back in about 48

18:21.023 --> 18:40.032
hours from Lamont and said that if it was 
permissible to ask for two, he would guarantee

18:21.023 --> 18:40.032
$40,000, one for each ship. Well, armed with 
guarantees of $100,000, we could then go to the We

18:50.285 --> 18:59.643
could then go to the John Hopkins group.

19:02.909 --> 19:12.107
They, in turn, could go to the Navy and say that we 
now have enough money to do the design work if you

19:02.909 --> 19:12.107
will permit us to work on it. This got us over enough 
of an administrative hurdle to where those in the

19:13.403 --> 19:29.062
Navy that thought it was a fine idea could win, and 
they gave him authorization to go ahead,

19:13.403 --> 19:29.062
providing it didn't interfere with his other 
work. It turned out that the design of these went

19:29.082 --> 19:37.673
very rapidly and very well, and soon they became 
available for oceanographers to use. In

19:39.273 --> 19:48.428
actuality, the Navy, of course, did not want to 
take our $20,000 apiece because that would have

19:39.273 --> 19:48.428
had some obligation that we could then keep it. So 
they just loaned us the units to use, and our

19:49.189 --> 19:57.062
$100,000 bluff paid off. We not only got free 
instruments, but... It also turned out that a new

20:00.822 --> 20:05.047
instrument had been developed for the 
oceanographic game.

20:07.890 --> 20:17.220
This was parlayed on further at the international 
oceanographic meeting that was going to be held in

20:07.890 --> 20:17.220
Europe. Dr. Wakelin, who was then Under Secretary 
of the Navy, cooperated very much on this, as he was

20:24.076 --> 20:33.148
at many levels of research, and he was staying in 
close contact with oceanography and the

20:24.076 --> 20:33.148
Oceanographic Committee. He got authorization 
to announce at this international meeting that

20:34.650 --> 20:49.189
these equipments that we had that had been built 
for American oceanography were going to be made

20:34.650 --> 20:49.189
available to the world at large. And this was one of 
the major breakthroughs in civilian navigation.

20:56.513 --> 21:05.361
Since that time, the equipments have become much 
smaller, much simpler, much cheaper, and much

20:56.513 --> 21:05.361
more accurate. And they are now sort of the 
standard navigational, the most standard

21:05.742 --> 21:17.252
navigational system for high seas navigation.

21:21.451 --> 21:43.740
I also want to add here that the man in the committee 
that carried the ball principally on this was Jim

21:21.451 --> 21:43.740
Snodgrass, but it was one of the kinds of things 
that all of us spent a great deal of time on because

21:21.451 --> 21:43.740
we felt it was so important that it was worthwhile 
dropping almost any other problem if that one

21:21.451 --> 21:43.740
needed carried along. The general problem of how 
one uses, how one probably used buoys at sea was and

21:51.995 --> 22:03.413
how one gets financed for developing buoys for sea 
and using buoys for measurement at sea received

21:51.995 --> 22:03.413
great impetus from this.

22:07.660 --> 22:12.367
Buoys, we had used buoys at Woods Hole a good deal. I 
had used some. Many others had. Scripps was using

22:17.115 --> 22:18.357
them. primarily in the weapons test to measure 
fallout on the Pacific. Had I mentioned that

22:24.583 --> 22:25.605
earlier? I think this deserves a little special 
merit because at Woods Hole, there was the great

22:27.268 --> 22:38.488
tendency to look at buoys as a way to make 
subsurface measurements. At Scripps, there was

22:38.468 --> 22:56.123
more of a tendency to use them for making 
measurements of nuclear fallout after the tests,

22:38.468 --> 22:56.123
so they were more interested in the surface 
phenomena, but they were also interested in a very

22:38.468 --> 22:56.123
much larger area, in huge areas of the Pacific. 
these effects and trends showed up because in

22:56.103 --> 23:25.182
later years the Scripps buoy program covered 
large sections of the Pacific and being more

22:56.103 --> 23:25.182
surface oriented they made cheaper buoys and they 
got more out that had to do with surface phenomena

22:56.103 --> 23:25.182
and meteorological phenomena and these served as 
a large part of the database in which the

23:26.613 --> 23:46.236
magnificent work that, under the sponsorship of 
Jerome Nimaeus, was later able to carry out in

23:26.613 --> 23:46.236
weather prediction, the influence of 
large-scale eddies and temperature anomalies in

23:26.613 --> 23:46.236
the Pacific.

23:49.199 --> 23:54.966
This, I think, was one of the fallouts, eventual 
fallouts, of that program. which certainly was

23:55.402 --> 24:06.456
not predictable in detail, but was predictable in 
the sense that Bowie feels would make it possible

23:55.402 --> 24:06.456
to do things like this. And from the standpoint of 
the world at large, this has probably been by all

24:07.317 --> 24:14.045
odds the most important contribution of Bowie's 
to date. And it's one part of it that I think all of us

24:14.726 --> 24:22.776
who were on that committee

24:14.726 --> 24:22.776
felt very good about. Also in this era, our

24:25.051 --> 24:45.372
technological approach of working on the nuts and 
bolts of research had helped produce budgets and

24:25.051 --> 24:45.372
ships and was doing this. we had simple buoys on the 
way. It was also very important to try and get a, see

24:51.259 --> 24:57.126
how stable you could make a ship.

25:00.731 --> 25:10.482
There's nothing in Newton's laws that says ships 
have to rock and roll, and at a somewhat earlier

25:00.731 --> 25:10.482
date, I had been down in New London one time looking 
at the two submarine hulls, which had been

25:13.297 --> 25:19.203
completed during the war and nothing had been put 
in them. And it certainly appeared that there

25:20.745 --> 25:25.510
should be a better use for those submarine hulls 
than going into razor blades. And so one bitter

25:27.513 --> 25:42.409
cold night driving back to New London coming 
through Taunton, I suddenly came to that if you put

25:27.513 --> 25:42.409
one of those on end, that...

25:44.347 --> 25:53.100
the natural heave period would be longer than that 
of the waves, and it should be a very stable

25:44.347 --> 25:53.100
platform.

25:53.761 --> 26:11.147
Pieces of this, I guess without any question,

25:53.761 --> 26:11.147
were original with me, but the fundamental 
thinking about it was on wave measurement buoys,

25:53.761 --> 26:11.147
which had been built by a variety of people and had 
been pushed very hard

26:13.439 --> 26:23.574
John Holmes, a technical man who had been working 
with us and with me at Woods Hole. Anyhow, I did get a

26:24.956 --> 26:38.535
report out on that, and it was one of the kinds of 
things that quite a few oceanographers talked

26:24.956 --> 26:38.535
about as a good thing to do. Well, we pushed this 
sort of a stable platform in our committee. We

26:46.331 --> 26:50.836
didn't know just when it would get done, but the 
principles were there. How do we get a technical

26:51.737 --> 27:05.670
base for oceanography that is commensurate with 
the improved fiscal base and the large number of

26:51.737 --> 27:05.670
fine new people that were coming into the 
business? And one of the things that the increase

27:07.135 --> 27:17.672
in money did is it produced, it gave not only new 
people, but it started bringing in people from

27:07.135 --> 27:17.672
other fields. And as such, the game became 
somewhat less incestuous than it had been before.

27:23.661 --> 27:34.999
Actually, in following this stable buoy program 
up, a few years later, in a committee called Navy

27:35.435 --> 27:48.149
committee called the Stag Committee, which was, 
its purpose was to see if sound went straight under

27:35.435 --> 27:48.149
the ocean. And if you ever tried to find a target 
with a piece of sonar gear, would it actually be

27:49.251 --> 27:55.237
where you thought it was going to be? Well, it was 
necessary to make some very precise horizontal

27:56.479 --> 28:01.024
measurements. And one of the key committee 
members Fred Spies from Scripps was

28:05.101 --> 28:12.470
involved in this. So what we did is we dusted out the 
earlier tentative proposals for a vertical spar

28:13.931 --> 28:21.420
buoy. He got a contract and did design work and 
turned it into what is now known as FLIT, which has

28:22.962 --> 28:32.813
been amazingly successful.

28:35.948 --> 28:46.520
Flip is a nice illustration of a basic concept that 
has been kicking around for heaven knows for how

28:35.948 --> 28:46.520
long. Holmes and others had put it into very 
effective use for measurement programs on a small

28:46.540 --> 28:57.653
scale of 10 to 20 feet long.

28:59.827 --> 29:07.402
I thought of taking something as crude as a 
submersible hole, which is of course not too

28:59.827 --> 29:07.402
crude, and doing it with that. And had certainly 
intended that it would be rotated so that you could

29:08.404 --> 29:13.093
operate it horizontally and then flip it up. But 
what Spiess and the Scripps crowd did was they put

29:15.666 --> 29:29.241
in that lovely piece of finesse to build it so it 
could be flipped several times during a day if

29:15.666 --> 29:29.241
needed. So if there was something wrong with it, 
something wrong with the bottom, you could flip it

29:29.301 --> 29:34.287
up and fix it. And that was one of the things that 
made it truly operational. So you could bring it

29:37.310 --> 29:39.492
into port every night if you wanted to. I hope we 
will see much more of stable ships, because I'm

29:43.195 --> 29:59.360
sure it is ridiculous to always bounce and rock and 
roll on the surface, just because most ships are

29:43.195 --> 29:59.360
designed to rock and roll, and sure enough, they 
do. Let's shut it off.

30:04.205 --> 30:17.640
one of the chapters of this report had to do with the 
disposal of nuclear waste had to do with

30:04.205 --> 30:17.640
radioactivity in the ocean of which some of the

30:21.923 --> 30:51.340
And at that stage of the game, it was very apparent 
that radioactivity in the ocean was not being

30:21.923 --> 30:51.340
looked at as hard as it should be, that

30:21.923 --> 30:51.340
the high level waste products would almost 
certainly require

30:21.923 --> 30:51.340
much more much more knowledge about their fate and 
what one might do with them, engineering-wise,

30:53.075 --> 30:59.205
than had been done. Atomic Energy Commission had 
informal representatives in the group. They

31:05.837 --> 31:06.658
worked very well. Ravel was particularly 
interested in this problem, as was Benny

31:06.738 --> 31:12.568
Schaefer.

31:14.978 --> 31:38.202
There was some discussion as to whether 
submersibles shouldn't be in a much wider variety

31:14.978 --> 31:38.202
of uses here, and whether the Atomic Energy 
Commission shouldn't

31:14.978 --> 31:38.202
be one of the sponsors of submersibles, because 
that would be one of the ways to determine the fates

31:14.978 --> 31:38.202
of radioactivity in the bottom.
