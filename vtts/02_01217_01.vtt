WEBVTT

00:03.743 --> 00:06.746
Yes, I am. I was born

00:06.946 --> 00:17.497
and

00:06.946 --> 00:17.497
waked up. Oh,

00:17.517 --> 00:24.184
give me a photo. My name is Diana. I was born and 
waked up. My father was born and waked up. But I have

00:30.730 --> 00:31.832
been living in New York for about 15 years. My 
father got sick.

00:41.780 --> 00:55.627
No, he wasn't

00:41.780 --> 00:55.627
a great guy. Well, he

00:56.689 --> 01:02.100
wasn't a great guy.

01:20.187 --> 01:21.473
It's a living thing.

01:40.285 --> 02:02.935
So

01:40.285 --> 02:02.935
he died. Oh,

02:03.370 --> 02:18.879
92. 92. But before that, he came back here because 
he was born here. He had a family here. He had a lot of

02:20.642 --> 02:21.203
family here. And he was one of the first women to 
come back here. And I was a priest there. And I was

02:22.806 --> 02:23.828
one of the first women to come back here. And I was a 
priest there. What were you doing here? Um, I

02:29.877 --> 02:39.873
was working for an agency. Oh, okay. I was a 
secretary, an assistant to an agency in the

02:42.137 --> 02:43.339
agency. With, uh, hours, or minutes, or who knows? 
T.V.s. T.V.s. Okay. I don't know. Not that good of

02:47.165 --> 02:47.666
an idea. It's okay. All right. You're an old 
graduate, not that good of an idea. Yeah. You're so

02:49.829 --> 02:50.250
smart, man. Um... Anyway,

02:51.160 --> 03:13.787
so, um, I was going to go to New Orleans, Florida, 
and see what we had. So, I did. Back when I came, I

03:14.027 --> 03:14.768
went to my dad's. It was open up since then. And, um, 
I went to my dad's. I went to my dad's.

03:39.980 --> 03:54.327
okay

03:56.197 --> 04:07.913
I've

03:56.197 --> 04:07.913
been here.

04:08.794 --> 04:09.015
Good thing. My mind is social.

04:20.791 --> 04:22.633
I like people. That's the reason I started working 
here. I started working here. As what? As a person.

04:27.905 --> 04:47.854
Yeah.

04:48.391 --> 05:04.594
Um,

04:48.391 --> 05:04.594
I think since they

04:48.391 --> 05:04.594
have a captive audience. Captive audience? Yeah, 
they, you know, testify, you know, they've been

05:04.974 --> 05:06.276
captivated. Yeah, yeah. I didn't know, I didn't 
know. It is. It is. So, again, we're in the country,

05:07.418 --> 05:08.239
and, uh, Basically,

05:08.742 --> 05:35.626
were you doing it

05:08.742 --> 05:35.626
on far and old, or ? No. Well, actually, I started 
working with my supervisor. And at the time, . And

05:37.187 --> 05:38.428
as the press grew, they sort of provided the 
attribution . Now,

05:39.185 --> 06:08.331
when you, what was your sense of the When

06:09.509 --> 06:34.075
I first came

06:09.509 --> 06:34.075
here,

06:09.509 --> 06:34.075
I

06:09.509 --> 06:34.075
was kind of afraid of it because everybody seemed 
so intelligent and just very professional and

06:09.509 --> 06:34.075
they had been here for so long. And they had moved 
from the old building into this, you know, do the

06:34.095 --> 06:36.057
trailer here and all of that. Yeah, because it was 
such a family. Yeah, and they had been through so

06:41.743 --> 06:46.613
much together. It was just, you know, really

06:46.633 --> 06:55.652
a unique group. Oh, once I got to know everybody 
again. I learned what was going

06:59.645 --> 07:08.058
on. I was a little afraid of my God, because I had 
never worked in publishing before, and I wasn't

07:08.078 --> 07:12.004
sure what was going on. Now, you just commented, 
you know, I didn't follow you, and you don't know

07:12.024 --> 07:16.911
what it is, and you're not the first person, but I'm 
the first person to know it. How do you tell them

07:17.498 --> 07:23.344
when they call? Do you try to explain to them?

07:34.857 --> 07:38.021
Well,

07:34.857 --> 07:38.021
I do. I try to explain to them. I try to help them do 
whatever I can. But I basically go through the

07:39.322 --> 07:41.264
differences between an evaluation process and a 
promotion process. Like, we don't charge, we

07:41.284 --> 07:42.345
don't publish all the work. I tell them about the 
faculty committee and the evaluation process

07:42.365 --> 07:44.308
management process go through. And we get to the 
point where everybody steps in and goes through.

07:46.490 --> 08:08.430
you get a cold call yes or something

07:46.490 --> 08:08.430
like that

07:46.490 --> 08:08.430
and i kind of got a straight story Because

08:08.900 --> 08:29.130
it's supposed to be a secret, and she's not going to 
tell anybody that her kid's a dad. So it's strange.

08:30.673 --> 08:31.173
I don't know. Yeah. I don't know who's going to be on 
there. I don't know who that

08:32.135 --> 08:36.101
is. Yeah. I don't know who that is. Yeah. I don't 
know who that is. When, do you feel like the volume

08:38.347 --> 09:00.378
of activity,

08:38.347 --> 09:00.378
the level of activity has definitely been 
increasing? Oh, definitely. Definitely. We are,

09:00.959 --> 09:03.743
not only have we published more books per year than 
we did when I first came here, but we've gotten new

09:00.959 --> 09:03.743
series, several new series. And just, like Sidney 
said, I'm not as interested as he is. It

09:06.697 --> 09:27.658
seems

09:06.697 --> 09:27.658
to be high or low points when you press

09:06.697 --> 09:27.658
activities. I guess what we're all doing is low 
points. You came in there. Yeah. The law is just

09:29.059 --> 09:29.800
totally falling down. Yeah, it is. And a lot of 
people are thinking that we're really

09:30.080 --> 09:31.321
disgusting. We're not really disgusting. We're 
just kind of demoralized. And when Mary came, was

09:36.937 --> 09:46.187
there a pickup or what was the reception like? The 
atmosphere

09:46.994 --> 10:12.394
was such at the time that

09:46.994 --> 10:12.394
the comments were so... Yeah,

10:13.336 --> 10:33.591
okay.

10:33.611 --> 10:35.074
Yeah, that's a good point. And that has

10:36.134 --> 10:50.630
happened, and it's been a long process. Yeah, 
we've done it, but I think it's coming down to it.

10:56.016 --> 10:59.740
Did Mary, you think, have a role in helping restore 
that communication? She was such an outsider.

11:00.281 --> 11:01.022
Well, I think that's what helped. The fact that she 
was an outsider, and she could come in and be

11:01.042 --> 11:02.884
objective about it. And the

11:03.269 --> 11:29.976
fact that

11:03.269 --> 11:29.976
she was so

11:03.269 --> 11:29.976
visible and always in the halls talking to people 
and asking, you know, their opinions. I mean, I

11:29.996 --> 11:30.617
think that's awesome. That's great. But I'm still

11:31.653 --> 11:45.487
exploring how to handle all of that.

11:48.110 --> 11:50.553
That's a good point to do. It's kind of sensitive. 
Yeah. That's a good point. And then, Mabel.

11:55.718 --> 11:55.858
Mm-hmm. Was that a surprise? No. Actually, the way 
they did that was really, I think, kind of helped

11:56.379 --> 11:58.201
tie everybody together. Everybody was involved 
in the structure classes. And that hadn't been

11:59.202 --> 11:59.863
done before. Everybody was involved. who

12:01.488 --> 12:23.132
was able to sit in on the interviews and was able to 
ask first things. We got together and decided that

12:23.152 --> 12:25.595
as a person, you're going to ask all the things so 
that it wouldn't be biased in any way. And then we

12:25.615 --> 12:27.597
would each ask to give our opinion or one thing in 
order to ensure that it was helpful. And that's how

12:27.617 --> 12:28.338
we ended up with one. I think that's what we're all 
about here. Yeah, okay. he's an outsider too yeah

12:31.795 --> 12:42.852
he's from the north yeah

12:43.692 --> 13:05.650
It's

12:43.692 --> 13:05.650
just a different

12:43.692 --> 13:05.650
way of working. Do

13:06.035 --> 13:32.903
you see any new directions

13:06.035 --> 13:32.903
or activities or things

13:06.035 --> 13:32.903
happening now? Well, I

13:34.216 --> 13:49.674
see us growing. I would like to see us, I know we'll 
never do the Oxford University for us, and some of

13:49.694 --> 14:01.908
the bigger ones, and Chicago, but I would like to 
see us be a major place in this life inside of us, and

13:49.694 --> 14:01.908
be with us. I think we can do it. I think we can do it. 
We can do this. Are

14:05.384 --> 14:21.188
you

14:05.384 --> 14:21.188
probably doing acquisitions

14:05.384 --> 14:21.188
yourself? Working with everybody? I'm working 
with everybody. I'm in the same support position I

14:26.095 --> 14:26.876
did. I grew up calling these names, but they're way 
up there. I've been in this room. I wrote it

14:28.519 --> 14:28.939
sometimes. That's great. Did you go to any of those 
blogs here today? Yeah. You didn't mail. Yeah. I

14:30.722 --> 14:31.603
wrote the articles on private commissions. I'm 
not sure everybody has their commissions now.

14:32.625 --> 14:32.725
Yeah. There's

14:32.705 --> 14:51.355
free lunch.

14:52.651 --> 15:09.563
Um, is there anything you think

14:52.651 --> 15:09.563
I, you know,

14:52.651 --> 15:09.563
if you were a writer, that you think would be 
particularly, would be a fun thing to do?

15:12.547 --> 15:32.252
That's

15:12.547 --> 15:32.252
the only thing we

15:12.547 --> 15:32.252
haven't talked about. Just the fact that your 
husband, the fact that your husband writes, and

15:32.272 --> 15:34.054
the other things. That's what I've heard. And I'm 
still running across files that smell like

15:34.555 --> 15:40.242
smoke, and I've got advantage, and it seems good to 
me. Yeah,

15:40.930 --> 16:01.911
and that's still kind of... I think that's true. 
Yeah, I think it is, too. And now that some of the

16:02.872 --> 16:07.977
university buses have closed, you know, because 
they weren't supported by the university or

16:02.872 --> 16:07.977
anybody, you know, it kind of makes you stop and 
wonder, you know, even though we are growing and

16:02.872 --> 16:07.977
expanding, you know, how far we've come. I mean, 
we're part of it. We're part of it. So, you know, I

16:08.877 --> 16:09.418
don't know. The only big part of it is they do have a 
financial wherewithal in a lot of places. Don't

16:23.675 --> 16:23.895
they? It worked. The system worked. We have a lot of 
Bordeaux's that are really supportive of us.

16:27.178 --> 16:27.579
Bordeaux are around. One of the new young guys got 
there, too. Well, the thing that really

16:28.440 --> 16:35.587
amazes me is that the young people on campus don't 
believe in this. They don't know who we are. In the

16:36.567 --> 16:46.527
fall, we did a lot

16:36.567 --> 16:46.527
of students who were lost, and they went to the 
programs, and they come over here, and they do a

16:36.567 --> 16:46.527
little sexual... office

16:46.692 --> 17:07.587
before i think we need to uh i

16:46.692 --> 17:07.587
think

17:09.473 --> 17:24.221
Because

17:09.473 --> 17:24.221
I'm sure there's people in the community who are 
doing their own tricks. I think that's what I'm

17:24.241 --> 17:25.103
going to try to do. Yes, you're going to need a base 
every year. And then another problem, part of our

17:33.843 --> 17:38.532
problem is we're in a red house. That is, if you're 
too focused on taxes, if you have trouble with the

17:38.552 --> 17:43.241
family, you think you ought to be focused on the 
great issues of the day. You can't win. Well,

17:44.185 --> 18:02.700
that's all I need for

17:44.185 --> 18:02.700
the moment.
