WEBVTT

00:02.596 --> 00:06.861
Well, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Well, this is 
Ron Shorn interviewing Bill Brunk in Washington,

00:08.323 --> 00:14.671
D.C. on October 13, 1993.

00:18.136 --> 00:20.439
Bill, for the record, will you state your full 
name? Okay, William Edward Brunk. And when and

00:24.644 --> 00:25.946
where were you born? I was born in Cleveland, Ohio 
on November 24, 1928. When did you get interested

00:32.144 --> 00:39.832
in science or astronomy or engineering or 
whatever, technical things? Actually, sort of as

00:39.852 --> 00:46.079
a side thing, I was interested in going to sea. I 
wanted to go to the Naval Academy. Was rejected by

00:50.063 --> 00:56.029
the Naval Academy after receiving an appointment 
because of a bad eye. Went back to Case Institute of

00:56.069 --> 00:59.873
Technology. because I had passed the entrance 
exam already for a case, having taken it to prepare

01:00.747 --> 01:27.092
for the Naval Academy entrance examination, and 
at that time all, which was 1946, everybody

01:00.747 --> 01:27.092
was coming back from the war, as the colleges were 
difficult to get into, and I finally got into a case

01:00.747 --> 01:27.092
in 1948 in civil engineering, graduated in 
mathematics, While I was going to undergraduate

01:28.135 --> 01:46.736
school, the head of the astronomy department 
asked me who was John Jason Nassau, or Jason John

01:28.135 --> 01:46.736
Nassau, I guess,

01:28.135 --> 01:46.736
invited me to come and work at the observatory, for 
what reason I do not know. Anyway, I did during my

01:46.756 --> 01:57.889
junior and senior years there, and when I 
graduated, he asked me what I was going to do with

01:46.756 --> 01:57.889
myself, and since I didn't know, he offered me an 
assistantship at Case in the astronomy

01:58.358 --> 02:15.857
department to get my master's degree, and I did 
that and then went to work for NACA, and eventually

01:58.358 --> 02:15.857
NACA became NASA, and they were interested in 
astronomy, so they sent me back to get a Ph.D. at

01:58.358 --> 02:15.857
Case in astronomy. So you were at what, Lewis 
Research Center? I went to the Lewis Flight

02:19.942 --> 02:21.944
Propulsion Laboratory. Okay, and what did you do 
while you were there? I worked for a fellow by the

02:24.787 --> 02:27.370
name of George M. Lowe. He was my section head. And I 
worked on supersonic aerodynamics, both

02:31.020 --> 02:36.805
theoretical and laboratory.

02:39.628 --> 02:43.352
What did you do your Ph.D. thesis on? I did my Ph.D. 
thesis on peculiar and metallic line A-stars,

02:43.372 --> 02:54.582
trying to detect them with a Schmidt objective 
prism images. And who did you do it under? It was

02:57.252 --> 03:00.756
done under Jason Nassau. All right. So you got your 
PhD. What happened then? I got my PhD in 1963.

03:10.048 --> 03:25.588
And in 1964, there was a need for somebody to come to 
NASA headquarters and take responsibility for

03:10.048 --> 03:25.588
programming planetary astronomy at NASA 
headquarters. I was invited to do so by Dr. Erner

03:26.429 --> 03:35.940
Liddell, who was the chief scientist for the Lunar 
and Planetary Program at NASA headquarters. Do

03:36.761 --> 03:41.487
you have any idea how he found you? I understand 
later that he found me through Nancy Roman. I had

03:46.713 --> 03:53.462
been on Nancy Roman's Astronomy Advisory 
Committee since 1958, I believe. As the Lewis

03:53.762 --> 03:55.083
representative? As the Lewis representative. 
When you got to headquarters, as I recall, that was

03:58.272 --> 04:10.372
about the time that there was the first little 
crunch in funding. And then your budget got bigger

04:10.392 --> 04:14.859
for a number of years. Is that correct, or would you 
tell us what happened?

04:20.568 --> 04:24.955
I was unaware of the initial crunch in funding 
because I was just coming in. The numbers that I'd

04:25.542 --> 04:33.209
seen were so tremendous to me, more like a fortune 
than in French. The budget did get bigger with time

04:33.229 --> 04:41.877
as planetary astronomy took on more and more 
importance. I don't recall right at the moment

04:41.897 --> 04:47.783
when the first significant budget crunch came 
after that. I'd have to look at the records. There

04:48.724 --> 04:50.085
was one in 1973. Well, that's ten years after I 
came. Let me ask a more general question. What do

05:00.578 --> 05:07.928
you think is the most important thing you did while 
you were headquartered?

05:07.948 --> 05:15.218
I think the most important, well, it is a very 
difficult question to answer for a couple of

05:07.948 --> 05:15.218
reasons. When I came to headquarters, it was the 
feeling of the division director, Mr. Oren Nix at

05:15.559 --> 05:22.228
that time, that ground-based planetary 
astronomy had seen its better days and i was

05:22.968 --> 05:46.377
informed when i arrived here that he would like to 
say that he'd give me some sort of a permanent

05:22.968 --> 05:46.377
position here but all it could give me was a 
temporary position because planetary astronomy

05:22.968 --> 05:46.377
was just about terminated Soon everything was 
going to be done from spacecraft, and there was

05:47.251 --> 06:00.570
going to be no need for anything to be done from the 
ground, and he was looking for somebody to come in

05:47.251 --> 06:00.570
and basically close out the program. That, of 
course, never happened. The importance of

06:06.218 --> 06:16.212
planetary astronomy, while low for a while there, 
became more and more significant and finally was

06:16.816 --> 06:23.362
if I may say so, competitive with the planetary 
spacecraft. And I think a lot of this was due to the

06:24.884 --> 06:38.417
fact that the instrumentation we had available, 
the techniques we had available, and the interest

06:24.884 --> 06:38.417
of the professional astronomers turned towards 
planetary observations. When I came on board, it

06:39.718 --> 06:44.983
was very difficult to get anybody to make 
planetary observations. and you'd go around

06:45.757 --> 06:54.690
almost begging people, if we give you some money in 
return for this, would you make an observation for

06:45.757 --> 06:54.690
us? Well, this changed with some of the initial 
successes in the flight program. It also changed

07:02.160 --> 07:15.139
not only because of that, but because 
instrumentation became available that we were

07:02.160 --> 07:15.139
able to turn onto planetary problems that people 
hadn't used for planetary problems before, and

07:02.160 --> 07:15.139
they suddenly discovered that this was something 
that was scientifically interesting. The other

07:20.220 --> 07:38.159
thing that happened, well, I would say therefore 
that the resurgence, or actually not a

07:20.220 --> 07:38.159
resurgence, but a genuine growth in planetary 
observations from the ground was probably one of

07:20.220 --> 07:38.159
the most exciting things that happened during the 
time I was here. And I would say today, as has been

07:39.300 --> 07:45.126
true for probably the last 15 years or so, the 
amount of research we can do in the planetary area

07:45.511 --> 07:59.029
or in the solar system area is limited more by the 
number of dollars we can put into it than by the

07:45.511 --> 07:59.029
people or the instrumentation that's available. 
So it's still being a very productive aspect of the

08:00.110 --> 08:05.417
overall program. The other thing that I was 
involved with, which went along with this but I

08:06.578 --> 08:14.809
think was also independently very valuable, was 
the construction of major instrumentation

08:15.127 --> 08:25.000
throughout the country, opening up new sites that 
were not opened before. And interestingly

08:25.801 --> 08:44.526
enough, it came about to a large extent because

08:25.801 --> 08:44.526
the National Science Foundation, who had been the 
primary

08:25.801 --> 08:44.526
financer of development of major 
instrumentation for astronomy or for planetary

08:45.400 --> 09:14.833
well for all astronomy made i think an unwritten 
decision that they were going to focus their

08:45.400 --> 09:14.833
attention on certain locations and so the major 
instruments that they built they built in places

08:45.400 --> 09:14.833
like the kit peak and saratololo and the national 
radio astronomy observatory but they had a few

08:45.400 --> 09:14.833
specific locations that they invested a large 
portion of their money in. In the area of planetary

09:17.019 --> 09:33.995
astronomy, we had a different objective, and that 
is that we needed to get major telescopes at

09:17.019 --> 09:33.995
locations which were optimized for planetary 
observations.

09:37.298 --> 09:44.145
Now, this had at least two aspects to it, possibly 
and probably even more. One aspect to it was that we

09:46.032 --> 09:56.347
wanted to put telescopes where there were people 
who had strong interests in planetary

09:46.032 --> 09:56.347
observations. And this led to the development of 
major telescopes in Texas, in Arizona, and a

09:57.428 --> 10:09.205
couple of other ones around. Well, Hawaii came in 
for a different reason. The other one was we wanted

10:13.572 --> 10:19.900
telescopes located for optimal planetary 
observations. And getting as close to the equator

10:21.542 --> 10:31.815
made Hawaii an extremely important location. In 
particular, when Mars is closest to the south of

10:32.135 --> 10:36.520
the celestial equator. Right. It's in the United 
States. It is as close to the equator as we could get

10:39.424 --> 10:42.668
in a available location and it was also separated 
from California and Texas by in longitude by

10:43.306 --> 11:12.958
significant distance and the advantage of this is 
that if you're looking at a planet which is a

10:43.306 --> 11:12.958
rotation period let's say similar to the earth or 
even one like Jupiter that doesn't have it similar

10:43.306 --> 11:12.958
you can see a different side of the planet from a 
site that's located at a sizable difference in

11:13.107 --> 11:14.249
longitude. Also, the weather patterns differ 
significantly enough so that you want to separate

11:14.769 --> 11:23.341
your telescopes significantly in longitude. We 
have run planetary patrols where we've actually

11:24.222 --> 11:34.296
run telescopes in places like Australia and 
India, as well as in Hawaii and throughout the

11:24.222 --> 11:34.296
United States. So longitude distribution is a 
very important thing in planetary observations.

11:41.525 --> 11:48.175
ask you something that's a little out of whack 
here, but I don't want to miss it. Two-part

11:48.195 --> 11:48.996
question. Do you think planetary astronomy was 
considered second-rate astronomy by the, quote,

11:49.838 --> 11:58.892
astronomical establishment in the USA when you 
started, and do you think it still is? The answer to

12:01.255 --> 12:03.519
both those questions is yes. I think it has 
received a great deal of respectability And it is

12:10.415 --> 12:18.587
now looked at with some considerable respect by 
many different types of astronomers. But to many

12:19.168 --> 12:26.598
astronomers who are interested in stellar and 
galactic work, it's still considered a

12:19.168 --> 12:26.598
second-rate citizen. The reason I asked that was 
your comment about trying to get people, you know.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.227
Here's the money, will you observe? And they turn 
you down. I had exactly that experience. Yes. And

12:36.373 --> 12:38.376
it's frustrating as all get out. Right. And we had 
it for years. Let me ask you two questions here,

12:41.363 --> 12:48.614
because there are two important people I can't 
interview. One is Kuiper and one is Harlan Smith,

12:49.336 --> 12:54.724
and so I have to go around and ask people about them. 
So let's start with the grand old man, Kuiper,

12:54.764 --> 12:59.431
Gerard Peter Kuiper. What was he like?

13:03.899 --> 13:06.122
Well, he talked a lot. He talked a lot and had an 
unlimited number of ideas, many of which were not

13:07.739 --> 13:15.250
good, but many of which were very good. And on the 
average, I think he had some wonderful ideas. He

13:20.598 --> 13:21.779
was a great promoter. He was a great seller of 
Gerard Kuiper. He had unlimited interest in

13:26.586 --> 13:32.875
astronomy, but especially in planetary 
astronomy. And he was a real salesman. He was a real

13:38.198 --> 13:39.740
innovator. Our whole reason for going over to 
Hawaii was Gerard Kuiper. That was his idea

13:47.469 --> 13:49.691
originally, wasn't it? Yes. In fact, he did the 
first work on it. How did he get frozen out of that?

13:58.702 --> 14:06.130
When NASA decided to put a significant-sized 
telescope over in Hawaii,

14:06.835 --> 14:36.133
gerard carper was very interested in doing it 
however there was some concern expressed that his

14:06.835 --> 14:36.133
empire was growing bigger than we felt that he 
could appropriately handle based to a large

14:06.835 --> 14:36.133
extent on the fact that we had worked with him in 
arizona he had built a telescope in arizona but he

14:06.835 --> 14:36.133
was his ideas were always going on and on new places 
new sites and we didn't think at that time that he

14:06.835 --> 14:36.133
might put as much personal attention into the 
Hawaii telescope as we would like to see it have. He

14:42.938 --> 14:50.446
wanted to operate it basically as a field station 
of Arizona, and he also wanted to use a relatively

14:42.938 --> 14:50.446
small telescope. We were interested in a slightly 
larger telescope. Here I'm talking the

14:53.329 --> 15:01.518
difference between something on the order of 82 
inches versus, he was talking 60 inches. He wanted

15:02.199 --> 15:06.964
to duplicate his Tucson telescope over in Hawaii. 
At that time we also involved a fellow from

15:07.636 --> 15:18.333
Harvard, Don Menzel, in the possibility of 
operating a telescope in Hawaii.

15:21.518 --> 15:23.841
How did you approach the University of Hawaii? At 
the time they had no astronomers, they had some

15:23.861 --> 15:29.170
solar astronomers, which is a different world 
than we're used to. How did that get going? Did you

15:31.974 --> 15:35.179
do it, or did someone else do it, or what happened? 
In those days, you must remember that most of the

15:36.391 --> 15:44.880
initiatives that took place were generated here.

15:48.464 --> 16:02.719
Unlike the National Science Foundation, who 
responds to the community, NASA has always, or at

15:48.464 --> 16:02.719
least for a long time, been in the position of 
initiating programs. And it was decided in NASA

16:04.150 --> 16:20.691
that we needed a major telescope at an excellent 
site

16:04.150 --> 16:20.691
separated in longitude and in weather pattern 
from the ones that were already available in Texas

16:04.150 --> 16:20.691
and in California. Hawaii looked wonderful. And 
it had the original tests on Hawaii that were made

16:23.775 --> 16:33.448
by Gerard Kuiper with his small telescope located 
over on Mauna Kea. showed that that would be a very

16:34.829 --> 16:38.834
good site. Also, he, Dr. Kuiper, did a very 
excellent job of selling Hawaii as a good site. We

16:48.727 --> 16:57.859
then tried to figure out what would be the best 
approach in developing a site over there. And as I

16:57.879 --> 17:02.305
said, we talked to Dr. Kuiper and we talked to Don 
Menzel at Harvard. We also, when I say we here, it's

17:03.652 --> 17:25.097
not so much me, it's more Erna Liddell, called in 
John Jeffries from Hawaii, who although they had

17:03.652 --> 17:25.097
relatively little experience with telescopes at 
that time, were interested in getting involved in

17:03.652 --> 17:25.097
telescopes. And John Jeffries, as you know, is 
also quite a good salesman. And The decision was

17:33.908 --> 17:50.363
made for several reasons, but mainly because we 
felt that Hawaii would place more personal

17:33.908 --> 17:50.363
interest in a telescope there than either Harvard 
or Arizona. The decision was made to go with John

17:52.365 --> 18:03.055
Jeffries, because he was going to duplicate a Kitt 
Peak telescope the 84-inch,

18:03.743 --> 18:15.960
and he was going to make use of people with some 
experience, like Hans Bosgaard and others who had

18:03.743 --> 18:15.960
had telescope building experience. So we simply 
took a chance on him. And it worked. And it worked.

18:23.330 --> 18:27.556
Let me ask you about another character, Harlan J. 
Smith. What was Smithy like? Well, Smith is also a

18:30.180 --> 18:32.383
tremendous salesman. And when I came on board 
here, he had already talked Erna Liddell and maybe

18:33.140 --> 18:53.707
Ron Shorn and Roger Moore into having him 
duplicate a telescope at the University of Texas,

18:33.140 --> 18:53.707
a large telescope for planetary purposes. And as 
was well known at that time, it was difficult to get

18:55.209 --> 19:01.678
people to make planetary observations. And so the 
fact that somebody with some clout, some

19:02.435 --> 19:30.754
authority, and a great deal of interest and 
personal responsibility here saying, let me

19:02.435 --> 19:30.754
duplicate a telescope and put it here and use it 
primarily for planetary purposes at this, what

19:02.435 --> 19:30.754
appeared to be a very good site, was received 
eagerly. back here at NASA headquarters. And when

19:34.180 --> 19:45.939
I came on board, all the paperwork was already in 
motion for the telescope at the University of

19:34.180 --> 19:45.939
Texas. To begin with. No, it was a smaller 
telescope. It was a smaller telescope. Harlan

19:49.725 --> 19:51.348
found a blank. A blank, 107-inch. And that's the 
reason it went up to 107-inch. It was originally

19:54.774 --> 19:56.877
84-inch. and basically it was going to be a 
duplicate of the one that was at kit peak same thing

19:57.818 --> 20:27.133
that uh john jeffries was going to do with hawaii 
and then harlan went wanted to go to a different

19:57.818 --> 20:27.133
mounting system and then he found the blank a much 
larger blank and came in and convinced in quotes us

19:57.818 --> 20:27.133
that it wasn't going to cost us any more money to 
build the larger telescope now Harlan Smith, and I

20:27.637 --> 20:36.987
got this in black and white, but he said it many 
times in person, said the biggest mistake he ever

20:27.637 --> 20:36.987
made was that he had two bids. One was for Bowler and 
Shivens, which was the higher bid initially. It

20:40.851 --> 20:42.072
was a turnkey operation. They delivered an 
operating working telescope. And the other one

20:44.054 --> 20:47.778
was from Westinghouse, which was like a million 
dollars cheaper. And he picked Westinghouse, and

20:49.239 --> 20:55.045
to his dying day, he regretted it as I'm sure you 
still do to this day. We still do to this day. I was

21:00.288 --> 21:07.659
observing at McDonnell at the time a lot, and

21:00.288 --> 21:07.659
it must have been horrible for you. Well, it was. It 
was horrible, and the cost went way up on it. And

21:12.907 --> 21:23.142
finally, we had to say, okay, we, NASA 
headquarters, are going to basically be the

21:12.907 --> 21:23.142
monitor on this telescope. And it's unfortunate 
for Harlan, but we said, Harlan, we just can't

21:23.864 --> 21:29.634
leave it to you. And what we did was, let's see, it 
was the vice chancellor at the University of

21:31.157 --> 21:37.849
Texas. What was his name? I forget it offhand. No, 
let's see. I know the dean of arts and sciences was

21:44.890 --> 21:55.426
John Silver, who is now president of BU, but this 
was the guy one step ahead, and I can't remember the

21:44.890 --> 21:55.426
name, but I can look it up. And then he went into the 
whole system after that. But basically, the

21:58.932 --> 22:06.443
difficulty is Harlan made all the original 
contracts. We had all kinds of problems. He had

22:09.248 --> 22:11.071
problems with Westinghouse. Westinghouse had 
all kinds of problems. The control system didn't

22:13.835 --> 22:15.177
work. And so they said, and it was more or less 
saying, trust us, trust us, trust us. We built

22:22.188 --> 22:23.310
nuclear submarines. So we finally did two things. 
We finally pushed it up above Harlan Smith at the

22:27.777 --> 22:33.426
University of Texas all the way up to the 
chancellor's office. And the, I think it was Vice

22:35.718 --> 22:45.808
Chancellor, took personal interest in it and 
attended all reviews himself of the telescope at

22:35.718 --> 22:45.808
Westinghouse. We then attended all reviews of the 
telescope at Westinghouse. We made Westinghouse

22:51.193 --> 23:00.962
report on all activities on, it was at least six 
months, I think probably at that time, quarterly

22:51.193 --> 23:00.962
basis. Harlan tells a story. that at one time, 
basically, the shell of the telescope was laying

23:02.937 --> 23:09.586
in a pit at Westinghouse with nobody working on it. 
Is that true? Quite possibly. But we tried to

23:13.370 --> 23:32.455
change the whole thing around and get 
Westinghouse to pay some attention to it, getting

23:13.370 --> 23:32.455
the highest concern at the highest levels of NASA, 
concerns at the highest levels of the University

23:13.370 --> 23:32.455
of Texas. We had these status reviews at 
Westinghouse. We had the top-level Westinghouse

23:36.874 --> 23:41.101
people there at Sunnyvale in on the reviews. We 
went through all the problems. They were open to

23:42.904 --> 23:44.386
all kinds of questions. We questioned them 
everything, things that they didn't want to talk

23:44.446 --> 23:49.033
about. We went through. We had planned tours every 
so often. We finally got it straightened out, but

23:54.041 --> 23:57.487
it was a real mess. And the telescope came in way 
over cost. I mean, like a million dollars over cost

24:00.194 --> 24:02.476
on the mountain. In fact, it would have been 
cheaper to adopt the bowler in general. Yeah,

24:05.420 --> 24:05.640
yeah. It would have been a lot faster. And we 
finally got it built. It's working fine, but it was

24:10.425 --> 24:13.448
a headache to get it built. And we decided at that 
time that if we ever did another telescope, we

24:13.468 --> 24:19.274
would do it in a different manner. And we have done 
other telescopes in a completely different

24:19.695 --> 24:23.799
manner. There was the Lake Lamentin.

24:30.130 --> 24:42.444
attempt by JPL to get about a 60-inch telescope or 
something on Table Mountain, and I know I signed

24:30.130 --> 24:42.444
off on that darn thing, and I thought it was done, 
but it died lousy back in 65 or something like that.

24:43.706 --> 24:45.007
Why did it die? I mean, JPL people wanted it at the 
time. We had, I guess, the biggest planetary

24:48.812 --> 24:52.837
astronomy group in the world.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.742
What happened? As I understand it, the thing that 
happened was a disagreement between

25:00.370 --> 25:03.914
headquarters and Caltech.

25:07.138 --> 25:15.607
And the

25:07.138 --> 25:15.607
people at JPL, which is, in effect, Caltech— Sort 
of. Well, that was one of the difficulties.

25:21.734 --> 25:29.162
We would agree to build a telescope, as we did with 
all our telescopes, as an instrument, but not as a

25:21.734 --> 25:29.162
facility. That meant that we would build the 
telescope, but not the building. And this was

25:36.909 --> 25:44.576
being done through Caltech, not through JPL, 
because we did build many facilities through JPL.

25:44.596 --> 25:46.598
We'd give them the telescope, but not the 
building. They went to upper management here,

25:48.660 --> 25:57.529
went to Caltech, as I remember it, and said, look, 
we'll give you one facility. Do you want the

25:58.235 --> 26:01.339
building for that telescope, or do you want a 
building on campus?"

26:05.325 --> 26:07.408
Caltech said, we want the building on campus. That 
was the end of the telescope. I've also heard that

26:11.955 --> 26:21.829
Caltech

26:11.955 --> 26:21.829
was interested in building the perfect telescope 
at the perfect in some indefinite future, whereas

26:22.568 --> 26:31.079
NASA obviously wanted to know things like what's 
the surface pressure on Mars, and Caltech could

26:22.568 --> 26:31.079
care less about that. Is that true? That aspect I 
don't remember at all. All I know, and it was in the

26:36.967 --> 26:50.584
records when I got here, it was no longer an active 
program under consideration, so I personally

26:36.967 --> 26:50.584
didn't have anything to do with it, but it had been 
turned down because Caltech basically said, if

26:36.967 --> 26:50.584
that's our building, we don't want it. Well, they 
had plenty of big, most of the big telescopes in the

26:52.150 --> 26:57.156
world already. Yeah, and it was JPL that wanted the 
60-inch telescope. Let's get, and I'm confused

27:03.102 --> 27:14.155
here because the acronyms are ganging up on me, but 
you had a lot to do about an infrared telescope, and

27:03.102 --> 27:14.155
I forget what it's called, the IRTF? Yeah, the 
IRTF. Okay. Back even in the 60s, there was all this

27:16.918 --> 27:21.583
talk about, in fact, that's one of the other JPL 
wanted to do was to build an infrared light bucket,

27:21.833 --> 27:28.922
and they never did get one built in Table Mountain. 
So that has a long story. Can you summarize it in an

27:30.464 --> 27:33.067
hour or less?

27:36.371 --> 27:49.748
Yes, there actually is a very good two-part

27:36.371 --> 27:49.748
report on that that came out in Science

27:50.690 --> 27:55.217
and went into a great deal of detail in the 
background of the IRTF.

27:58.301 --> 27:59.823
I had a copy of it around here someplace. I don't 
know where it is. But anyway, this was the thing. We

28:03.328 --> 28:14.264
wanted to get a light bucket in the infrared, and 
that was, there was a, let's say there was a

28:03.328 --> 28:14.264
meeting. By that you mean not a really superb 
primary mirror or something, just something to

28:14.284 --> 28:19.532
collect light and put it on a Originally, the 
astronomers said what we want is a large aperture,

28:19.732 --> 28:33.248
large mirror light bucket for the infrared to make 
infrared observations of the planets. What's his

28:35.531 --> 28:36.031
name? Hugh Johnson at Arizona was building metal 
mirror telescopes, infrared light buckets.

28:49.567 --> 28:50.348
Harold Johnson. And in addition, there was one 
built at Caltech, Bob Layden. I think Guido Munch

28:58.139 --> 29:00.482
was working with him on that one. And at the time, of 
course, infrared detectors were very

29:01.263 --> 29:05.749
insensitive. And they were doing an infrared sky 
survey. But there was a lot of argument as to the

29:09.775 --> 29:17.025
value of infrared observations for planetary 
work. Now, if you could get resolution, that was

29:17.866 --> 29:22.831
fine, but you didn't think you could get 
resolution. There was a planetary astronomy

29:22.851 --> 29:37.267
study done at,

29:22.851 --> 29:37.267
oh, what's the name of that? It was published in the 
early 1960s,

29:37.287 --> 29:47.198
and it was, I think, a location that the NSF had up in 
New England someplace. It wasn't Woods Hole.

29:52.148 --> 29:54.031
It was another location. I don't have a copy of 
the... I have it packed away and my stuff is in

29:55.833 --> 29:59.337
storage, but I don't have a copy of it here. But 
there was a group put together to look at the

29:59.997 --> 30:10.269
potential of planetary astronomy, ground-based 
planetary astronomy. And one of the things they

30:12.532 --> 30:15.075
came up with was the desirability of having an 
infrared telescope.

30:25.364 --> 30:32.053
That generated our initial interest in infrared. 
It was originally thought to be about a

30:32.073 --> 30:35.918
three-meter light bucket.

30:41.365 --> 30:44.269
Then as things improved and detectors became 
better, The concept changed from a three meter

30:44.738 --> 30:50.908
light bucket to a three meter higher quality 
instrument. Although actually, when the IRTF was

30:51.348 --> 30:58.539
built, we didn't anticipate that the mirror was 
going to be as good as it was.

31:01.985 --> 31:10.037
Now,

31:01.985 --> 31:10.037
there was also a desire to have it in the best 
possible location.

31:14.219 --> 31:31.244
From the experience that we had in the infrared, it 
looked to us as if Hawaii, Mauna Kea, was probably

31:14.219 --> 31:31.244
the best site to put an infrared telescope. So we 
started looking at Hawaii, and Jeffries had

31:31.264 --> 31:37.654
already built the 88-inch telescope. We started 
looking at that site and the University of Hawaii

31:38.215 --> 31:43.062
to do an infrared telescope. on Mauna Kea. There 
was considerable concern expressed by the

31:47.380 --> 32:10.987
community outside

31:47.380 --> 32:10.987
of Hawaii that we were really not doing the 
appropriate analysis of capabilities and sites

31:47.380 --> 32:10.987
if we were going to build a major infrared 
telescope.

32:11.007 --> 32:14.010
This resulted in a program being undertaken, 
which we did site surveys. I think we started out

32:20.125 --> 32:23.788
with about eight sites, ended up with something 
like five. Jim Westfall at Caltech handled the

32:24.729 --> 32:31.455
actual site survey for us. The sites included 
Mauna Kea, I think White Mountain,

32:33.918 --> 32:43.947
a site in Arizona. There's

32:45.833 --> 32:58.986
a report that's out on it. Again, it's filed away. 
When I retired in 1985,

33:00.948 --> 33:14.642
some of these things I've got copies of, but 
they're all stored away, and I think NASA has

33:00.948 --> 33:14.642
copies of all the reports. The things that were 
looked at were the water vapor content of the

33:15.517 --> 33:26.128
atmosphere above the site and something called 
infrared noise. And I still think that they don't

33:27.989 --> 33:30.892
understand infrared noise. We had infrared noise 
monitors that were designed by Jim Westfall,

33:32.073 --> 33:44.646
approved by Frank Lowe, and we did water vapor 
studies And we did them for one full year at all of

33:44.947 --> 33:47.871
these sites. A blind survey. The data all came in by 
number, and the analysis were all made by number.

33:56.281 --> 34:04.811
And it wasn't until the analysis were completed 
that the translation of the numbers into sites

33:56.281 --> 34:04.811
were known. But it showed that, except for some 
unusual periods, the best location was Hawaii.

34:14.883 --> 34:20.790
White Mountain looked very good, but 
unfortunately, due to weather, you couldn't do a

34:14.883 --> 34:20.790
continuous observation. They had to keep pulling 
the observers off White Mountain. So Mauna Kea

34:25.376 --> 34:39.153
became the site of favor, although many people 
argued that we were making a mistake by going to

34:25.376 --> 34:39.153
Hawaii because the cost of going up on the mountain 
there was very expensive. The working conditions

34:39.513 --> 34:41.616
were very severe. The number of legitimate 
planetary astronomers were less there, and so

34:43.233 --> 34:52.421
there was a lot of desire to go to a place like 
Arizona. So I think in the actual priority rating

34:53.362 --> 35:12.379
by an outside committee that looked at all the 
results of the site surveys and every one of the

34:53.362 --> 35:12.379
people put in a proposal and they talked about 
logistics and the engineering support and the

34:53.362 --> 35:12.379
university support and everything else, they 
came up and rated Hawaii top Arizona second, and

35:12.730 --> 35:17.036
then the other ones further on down the list. We 
went to Hawaii. We originally were going to build a

35:21.022 --> 35:27.792
fork mounting.

35:30.896 --> 35:31.717
We did a couple of things. One of them is we put 
together a committee of three people, Frank

35:31.757 --> 35:40.510
Lowell, Fred Gillette,

35:42.211 --> 35:52.322
Neugebauer, Gary Neugebauer, to come up with the 
design of a telescope, rough design of a

35:42.211 --> 35:52.322
telescope.

35:52.342 --> 36:03.554
They would like to have a polar mounting

35:52.342 --> 36:03.554
with a north pole and south pole.

36:07.058 --> 36:08.640
Hawaii wanted to go with a fork.

36:11.303 --> 36:12.804
Finally, Hawaii won out. We went with the design of 
a fork. However, the fork design could not be shown

36:17.089 --> 36:29.421
to satisfy the needs of the infrared observers, 
and we finally went with the polar mounting. So you

36:29.441 --> 36:34.766
have enough room at the bottom end to mount their 
equipment and so forth? It was stability more than

36:34.786 --> 36:36.808
anything. Repeatability. The example of a 
120-inch I

36:41.054 --> 36:51.364
mean, you have hysteresis and other serious 
problems. You have flexure and gravitational

36:52.325 --> 37:00.172
deformation of the telescope mount. And even 
though Charlie Jones, who did the design, tried to

37:00.192 --> 37:08.800
convince us that it would There was enough 
question about it, so they changed the design to

37:09.539 --> 37:14.547
the other. And that's important, because a lot of 
these infrared sources are not visible when you

37:15.750 --> 37:24.384
look through an eyepiece, so you've got to know 
where you're pointing. You've got to know where

37:24.444 --> 37:25.746
you're pointing. But there was another reason we 
finally changed the mount design. It had nothing

37:30.755 --> 37:31.857
to do with the mount. It had to do with a cracked 
mirror.

37:39.138 --> 38:01.482
And the problem that we had there was, in an attempt 
to save money, NASA came up with a mirror that had

37:39.138 --> 38:01.482
been purchased for testing, not for the space 
telescope, but for testing, for figuring out the

37:39.138 --> 38:01.482
space telescope mirror. And we were given that 
mirror. and we're going to use it for the IRTF.

38:11.019 --> 38:29.408
Unfortunately, on the grinding table at Kitt 
Peak, for one holiday, it developed a crack,

38:11.019 --> 38:29.408
and we were forced to go to another replacement 
mirror.

38:33.034 --> 38:35.217
Being forced to go to the replacement mirror 
provided us with an unexpected additional amount

38:35.770 --> 38:45.359
of time to finish the telescope, which was enough 
time to change the design of the mount. You might

38:47.021 --> 38:50.664
say, why this particular concern? We were trying 
to finish the IRTF in time to make measurements of

38:53.146 --> 39:02.335
the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn and of the 
planets themselves prior to the launch of the

39:04.390 --> 39:09.315
Voyager spacecraft. That was probably the main 
driver on the telescope schedule. When the mirror

39:20.226 --> 39:27.012
cracked, we were no longer able to meet that 
schedule. And even though there were some

39:27.032 --> 39:31.917
questions about the design of the mount prior to 
that, the desire to meet that schedule, because we

39:32.504 --> 39:45.640
had promised Congress that we were going to meet 
that schedule, said, OK, maybe the design mount

39:32.504 --> 39:45.640
won't work. But to meet the schedule, we'll go with 
it. When the mirror cracked and we had to go back and

39:48.383 --> 39:57.955
replace the mirror and start over again, that gave 
us a forced delay in the schedule. that forced

39:58.458 --> 40:04.766
delay in the schedule was sufficient to allow us to 
go back and redesign the mount of the telescope.

40:04.786 --> 40:10.272
Who was the managing institution for the IRTF? 
University of Hawaii? University of Hawaii. And

40:12.595 --> 40:14.057
who runs it now? How is it run now? Okay, it is still 
run by the University of Hawaii under contract to

40:15.879 --> 40:21.506
NASA. It is a NASA facility, completely a NASA 
facility. NASA owned and but operated for us by the

40:26.352 --> 40:32.922
University of Hawaii under a contract. Now, 
here's a question that has three parts, but it's

40:33.142 --> 40:38.490
really only one. As I recall, one of the deals that 
Texas got was that they were going to devote a

40:39.512 --> 40:51.309
substantial fraction of time on what became the 
107-inch to planetary observing. But the 88-inch

40:51.329 --> 40:55.195
at Hawaii and the 107-inch McDonald and the IRTF 
were funded by NASA. What fraction of time do they

41:02.889 --> 41:11.081
have to give to NASA or planetary observers? I 
don't remember the specific fraction of time, but

41:11.101 --> 41:25.080
it was something on the order of 30 percent of the 
time on the telescope had to be made available for

41:11.101 --> 41:25.080
guest observers. that was people that were not 
associated with the institution that had the

41:25.668 --> 41:33.899
telescope. Now it's very important to say that the 
approach used for both the 107-inch at Texas and

41:33.919 --> 41:47.857
the 88-inch in Hawaii were quite different than 
that used for the IRTF. In both the Texas and

41:49.680 --> 41:53.565
smaller Hawaii telescope, we nasa provided money 
to build the instrument not the building and not

41:54.777 --> 42:21.595
the dome they were specifically excluded in 
return for paying for the instrument in all

41:54.777 --> 42:21.595
aspects of the instrument although we couldn't 
pay for the piers that was part of the building but

41:54.777 --> 42:21.595
paying for the instrument plus assuring that we 
would provide funding for the operation of the

42:22.452 --> 42:39.227
telescope, it was agreed that a significant 
amount of time on the telescope would be used for

42:22.452 --> 42:39.227
planetary studies, and something on the order of 
30 percent of the time would be made available to

42:22.452 --> 42:39.227
observers from other institutions. We could not 
take government money and give it to one

42:40.028 --> 42:44.052
institution. They basically had to operate a 
facility that was available part of the time for

42:45.573 --> 42:51.058
other things.

42:54.532 --> 43:08.468
I think it may be, and you'd have to check me on this, 
but my memory says that the agreement was that they

42:54.532 --> 43:08.468
would do planetary research for something like 
30% of the time.

43:09.009 --> 43:16.477
We would pay them something like 30% of the 
operating costs of the telescope, plus providing

43:09.009 --> 43:16.477
them with a telescope in the first place. And a 
certain fraction of that 30% had to be used by

43:16.497 --> 43:23.205
non-institution

43:16.497 --> 43:23.205
people. In the case of the IRTF, that was from the 
start to the finish a NASA instrument.

43:31.940 --> 43:36.665
Instrument, building, dome, piers, all NASA. 
100% NASA.

43:41.971 --> 43:46.776
We paid the full operating cost of that telescope 
and continue to do so.

43:49.759 --> 43:52.602
But in return for operating it for us, The 
University of Hawaii gets something like 25% of

43:53.678 --> 43:58.526
the time on the telescope. The division of 
observing time between planetary and

44:00.569 --> 44:17.376
non-planetary, or let's say solar system and 
non-solar system, since we include other things

44:00.569 --> 44:17.376
other than just the planets now, is decided by NASA 
in advance. And it has been something like 50-50.

44:21.826 --> 44:32.477
But NASA reserves the right to increase or 
decrease, as it wishes, the amount of time on solar

44:21.826 --> 44:32.477
system observations. But it has to do so in 
advance. Now, NASA is the sole funder of the IRTF,

44:36.441 --> 44:43.408
with one exception. And that is that the National 
Science Foundation said to NASA If you say you're

44:50.193 --> 45:18.359
going to operate this as a national facility, 
which is what NASA says it is doing, we want you to

44:50.193 --> 45:18.359
provide subsidies for the observers similar to 
those we provide at Kitt Peak, Cerro Tololo, NRAO,

44:50.193 --> 45:18.359
et cetera.

45:18.379 --> 45:19.440
We said, fine. But much of the time is going to be 
spent making observations that are not of

45:20.230 --> 45:26.279
interest to NASA.

45:31.647 --> 45:32.909
The NSF said, fine. We will provide the subsidy 
funding for travel, things like this, for the time

45:34.131 --> 45:47.672
not used for NASA programs, if you provide a 
similar amount for NASA programs. So every year,

45:48.142 --> 46:00.914
we get a small amount of money from NSF to provide 
subsidy to the people working on programs not of

45:48.142 --> 46:00.914
interest to NASA.

46:06.639 --> 46:10.703
Let me change the subject here and ask you 
something that's purely an opinion. Back at the

46:12.064 --> 46:16.208
turn of the century, planetary astronomy was a 
respectable subject. By 1930, it was not popular,

46:16.643 --> 46:24.195
in fact, even dangerous to be in, according to 
people like Fred Whipple. What do you think killed

46:24.736 --> 46:28.762
it?

46:28.782 --> 46:40.440
I think the thing that killed it was the fact that we 
had just about reached the limit of what could be

46:28.782 --> 46:40.440
done with the instrumentation that was available 
back at the turn of the century.

46:43.728 --> 46:53.278
We had got just about every piece of information we 
could except for just continuing looking at

46:43.728 --> 46:53.278
changing in surface appearance of the planets and 
things like this. What happened to change it was

46:54.399 --> 47:03.068
that when planetary astronomy went out of favor, 
instrumentation development was still taking

46:54.399 --> 47:03.068
place. And very few people use these new 
developments to look at the planets. And in fact,

47:08.794 --> 47:11.237
when I came on board in 64, We were still trying to 
get people to use basically standard techniques

47:11.639 --> 47:18.949
for stellar astronomy to look at the planets.
