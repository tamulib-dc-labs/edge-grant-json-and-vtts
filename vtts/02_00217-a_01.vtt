WEBVTT

00:01.904 --> 00:16.920
first, I believe, and I'm at 1001 Village Drive in 
College Station, getting ready to chat with

00:01.904 --> 00:16.920
Professor Emeritus Will Worley, but we're going 
to chat about his student experiences. Will, now

00:17.561 --> 00:19.463
would you cast your microphone? That's me. All 
right.

00:28.753 --> 00:30.375
Well, to help a future user of this material, would 
you give a brief summary of your background and

00:30.760 --> 00:46.458
experiences before you arrived at Texas A&M to 
begin your studies here as a student? Where did you

00:46.658 --> 00:48.680
grow up and what did your family do? I'm a native of 
Dallas, born in October 18, 1921. I went to grade

00:53.105 --> 00:59.873
school at James W. Fanning High School at Woodrow 
Wilson High School. A unique thing about it was

01:00.359 --> 01:07.188
that it had the largest high school ROTC unit in the 
country. I was a company commander there in the

01:08.129 --> 01:23.228
high school ROTC, and almost from birth I planned 
to come to Texas A&M, which I did starting in

01:08.129 --> 01:23.228
September 1939. Had you ever visited the campus 
before you came down here to enroll? Only once. It

01:29.056 --> 01:31.520
was that summer, just before I enrolled. At that 
time, they were just finishing the 12

01:32.121 --> 01:40.993
dormitories, and so I lived in dormitory one, a 
core dorm. In fact, all the dormitories on the

01:41.053 --> 01:45.880
campus were core dorms then. They also had some 
project houses, which were on the campus. Each

01:50.547 --> 01:51.308
county had had a project house that they 
sponsored. Let's go back. When you came down to

01:57.820 --> 02:05.870
enroll, how did you get down here and what did you 
bring in terms of gear and paraphernalia? I came

02:06.531 --> 02:15.642
with a mother and a classmate who I went to school 
with at Woodrow and each of us came with one

02:06.531 --> 02:15.642
footlocker and that was it. She let us out and drove 
back home and we were on our own. He got into the

02:20.448 --> 02:24.772
chemical warfare, and I got into the Signal Corps 
unit. What was in your footlocker? Well, my mother

02:27.595 --> 02:46.675
bought a new blanket, and we had sheets, and we had 
very little civilian clothes because as soon as we

02:27.595 --> 02:46.675
got here, then they would issue GI clothes, a 
blouse, a shirt or two, a pair of pants, and then we

02:27.595 --> 02:46.675
had to buy other things. clothing that we need, but 
we wore uniforms all the time. We had to have our own

02:51.603 --> 02:54.147
jackets. We did, I think, have a sort of a raincoat, 
an all-weather raincoat, and this is all we had. We

03:02.058 --> 03:05.563
also had to get an IES study lamp. This was 
required, a good study lamp. Did she let you out

03:10.685 --> 03:14.949
near your dorm? At our dorm, within a little ways, 
and then she went on home. What was your first

03:19.054 --> 03:28.463
contact with Aggie

03:19.054 --> 03:28.463
ways, with orders, directives, or anything else? 
Well, of course, as freshmen, while we were the

03:28.784 --> 03:36.912
lowest form of life, and the sophomores oriented 
us in a hurry, They really were the ones that kept us

03:37.145 --> 03:42.494
in line, and then the juniors and the seniors. But 
the seniors monitored the juniors, and the

03:42.554 --> 03:52.130
juniors monitored the sophomores, and the 
sophomores took care of us. Now this is September

03:52.631 --> 03:53.813
1939. Yes.

03:57.158 --> 03:59.482
You and your outfit? B Signal Corps. We had three 
Signal Corps outfits. practically all of us were

04:03.419 --> 04:18.861
majoring in electrical engineering, which was 
fortunate in a way because then you ate together,

04:03.419 --> 04:18.861
you slept together, you went to class together, 
you waited on upperclassmen all together. And so

04:18.921 --> 04:24.469
it was a very enduring relationship that has 
persisted even now. Describe a typical day of

04:25.931 --> 04:32.160
classes, not a weekend day, but a weekday, 
describe a typical day. When did it begin and what

04:34.289 --> 04:38.773
happened and when did it end that fall? All right. 
First we got up and went outside and had a yell

04:39.954 --> 04:44.538
practice. Then we came back in and we cleaned up our 
room and then we cleaned up an upperclassman's

04:44.558 --> 04:51.405
room. And this was until about seven o'clock when 
we woke up our upperclassman. It so happens I was

04:57.631 --> 05:02.215
the room orderly for the company commander and his 
Then we fell out for a mess, and we marched the mess

05:02.482 --> 05:26.397
from dormitory one up to the other end of the dining 
hall, and we sat next to an upperclassman, and we

05:02.482 --> 05:26.397
gave him meal service, which meant we waited on him 
while he sat at the table with him and be sure that he

05:02.482 --> 05:26.397
had everything wanted that was on the table. And 
usually they ate, and then they left, and we ate at

05:26.883 --> 05:36.177
the same time, but they started eating before we 
got to eat. All right, and then classes? All right,

05:39.341 --> 05:45.751
then, of course, we went back to the dormitory and 
finished up cleaning our own room. Usually

05:46.432 --> 05:51.239
classes started at 8 o'clock, so then we went to 
class till noon. We came back to the dorm, and then

05:51.960 --> 05:56.046
we marched a mess again. and then classes in the 
afternoon, and then we marched to Mass. In the fall

06:01.444 --> 06:13.700
semester during the football season, we had Yale 
practice four times a week, Monday after supper,

06:01.444 --> 06:13.700
Tuesday, and then Thursday, and then Friday 
night. And we had Yale practice in front of the

06:15.101 --> 06:18.826
YMCA. The band was up at the top of the steps, and the 
Yelp leaders in front of them, and the freshmen on

06:22.250 --> 06:33.526
the sidewalk, the sophomores and the juniors in 
the street, and the seniors behind the

06:22.250 --> 06:33.526
underclassmen. So this lasted about 30 minutes. 
And then the freshmen needed to run back to the

06:37.932 --> 06:43.840
dormitory and get there before the sophomores got 
back. And we had a little Yelp practice there. And

06:47.485 --> 06:52.172
then at 7.30, we went into our room and studied 
until 10 o'clock. And then we're supposed to go on

06:53.131 --> 06:58.541
to bed by 11 o'clock, so that was the day. If you had 
any time during the day not scheduled for classes

06:58.581 --> 07:07.678
or any other activities, where did you spend that 
time? We were supposed to come back to our

07:08.299 --> 07:14.751
dormitory and be available for errands for the 
upperclassmen. Did you do that or did you go off to

07:16.604 --> 07:20.248
the library or somewhere? Well, we mostly came 
back. We couldn't go in the YMCA. That was for

07:27.595 --> 07:29.017
upperclassmen. They had a bowling alley and they 
played ping pong. We could go there on Sunday

07:32.761 --> 07:34.743
morning. That's when they had church services.

07:40.689 --> 07:41.970
Let's see.

07:44.465 --> 07:54.775
Describe some of the incidents that today would be 
identified as hazing that you remember from your

07:44.465 --> 07:54.775
freshman and or sophomore years. Well, of course, 
hazing, you did run errands. That wasn't the type

08:00.300 --> 08:02.322
of hazing, I guess. But we had bleed meetings. This 
is where we got out in the hall with the sophomores,

08:06.607 --> 08:13.273
and the sophomores would bleed at us. You know, 
they would gripe at us how sorry we were and that

08:13.608 --> 08:17.635
sort of thing. And then we would have an ass tear, 
maybe. Which, of course, using paddles on our

08:21.983 --> 08:24.667
behind. That was the main thing. Did you ever get 
paddled for something you didn't do? Well, yeah,

08:36.389 --> 08:38.731
we did this. This is part of it, I guess. I don't 
know. But, you know, after a few weeks, we all had to

08:41.214 --> 08:45.978
study. And so this sort of thing kind of died, you 
might say, and it settled down to normal routine.

08:55.267 --> 09:05.417
After those first few weeks, I was sure glad I was 
here because of the comrades we developed, these

08:55.267 --> 09:05.417
lifelong relationships that we still have 
contact with and this sort of thing, and they

09:05.718 --> 09:10.608
didn't have time for us anyway. They had their own 
studies to take care of. Now, you were in the new

09:13.794 --> 09:15.999
dorm area? I was in the new dormitory. These were 
brand new dorms. There was 12 of them. Let's see.

09:27.655 --> 09:30.299
Did you all refer to fish old ladies in those days? 
Oh, yeah. Our roommate was an old lady. And did that

09:34.926 --> 09:39.273
friendship for you, was that a lasting one, your 
old lady? Is that what? A lasting friendship? Oh,

09:42.278 --> 09:42.799
it is. We went out to see him in Arizona just this 
last fall. He now has had a stroke. And, of course,

09:51.905 --> 09:56.750
he can't drive around, but he can talk fine and 
visit pretty well.

09:59.554 --> 09:59.954
Let's see. You had selected your major before you 
got here. No, it was a coincidence, but it so

10:03.999 --> 10:06.522
happened. He went to Woodrow Wilson, too. He 
finished in January and went to school another

10:09.525 --> 10:15.552
semester. And so we just showed up together. We 
were roommates. I'm not sure how it happened, but

10:21.537 --> 10:22.599
Fortunately, he did. When did you select your 
major, electrical engineering? Right away. Oh,

10:28.147 --> 10:28.688
yeah. And one of the reasons I did it was because my 
father was with Graybar Electric Company. He was

10:34.737 --> 10:43.229
in the electrical business, and it was at his 
suggestion, and I just went ahead and signed up for

10:34.737 --> 10:43.229
electrical engineering, and this is what I 
finished in. Now, was electrical engineering at

10:43.269 --> 10:47.916
that time thought of as a new discipline kind of out 
front on the edge of new knowledge? Well, it was a

10:57.897 --> 10:59.979
state of the art. At that time, it was more power 
than electronics. We also had transmission, but

11:04.484 --> 11:12.553
the main job opportunities for us was to go with 
utilities go with the telephone company or go with

11:13.090 --> 11:21.560
GE or Westinghouse or Alice Chalmers. They were 
all in the areas of power in the telephone company,

11:22.000 --> 11:26.826
of course. And that's where most of our graduates 
were going.

11:32.933 --> 11:36.837
Your outfit nickname, what was its nickname? My 
what? Your Corps outfit. Oh, it was B-Signal

11:40.632 --> 11:42.596
Corps. Did it have a nickname? Yeah, they sure did. 
They all had nicknames. Signal Corps was Signal

11:47.844 --> 11:49.887
Crappers. Engineers were Crapper Builders. 
Infantry were Paddle Feet. Chemical Warfare were

11:57.298 --> 11:59.962
Stink Bombers. And Field Artillery was Buggy 
Bitches. And Calvary was jock swabbers.

12:12.300 --> 12:12.781
Let's see.

12:16.246 --> 12:26.742
What did you, that first year, what did you and your 
friends do when you didn't have anything on campus

12:16.246 --> 12:26.742
you had to do? What did y'all do for fun? There 
wasn't much place to have any fun here. They did

12:33.719 --> 12:41.448
have a beer place across from the North Gate, but 
that was the only liquor you had in the county. You

12:41.909 --> 12:43.771
might go over and drink a beer. They had the

12:43.811 --> 12:51.100
theater was the assembly hall. This is now where 
the All Faith Chapel is, so we could go to movies and

12:51.661 --> 13:00.892
go into brine. They had two movie houses there. The 
campus theater opened that year. And we had to

13:06.681 --> 13:13.991
boycott the Bryan Theaters for that reason. I'm 
not sure why we could only go to the campus theater.

13:18.397 --> 13:19.198
You mean the students? The students. The 
upperclassmen said we're boycotting the Bryan

13:20.440 --> 13:25.647
Theaters, so we didn't go. We had to hitchhike into 
Bryan. They did have a bus system, but we never used

13:28.282 --> 13:31.285
it. And they had some taxes. How many nights, on the 
average, did you have that you didn't feel you had

13:33.888 --> 13:40.134
to be studying? The only night was Wednesday 
night. And this is to go to church. And then

13:47.462 --> 13:50.525
Saturday and Sunday were pretty well free. Did you 
go to any church activities on Wednesday night?

13:55.242 --> 13:58.226
No, I didn't. But there were Wednesday night 
services available. Oh, yes. On Saturday night,

14:04.695 --> 14:10.042
where did you and your friends usually go? Well, 
there wasn't much to do on Saturday night, really.

14:13.187 --> 14:15.109
I remember we hitchhiked. One classmate and I 
hitchhiked to Houston to see Gone with the Wind.

14:21.787 --> 14:26.131
But on the weekends, we all took off and most 
everybody had to hitchhike. There was only one man

14:26.511 --> 14:29.314
in the outfit that had a car. And of course, the 
cars, you had to park in a certain place and leave

14:29.334 --> 14:34.538
them there all week. You couldn't drive on campus 
on them. You could get in the car and go into Brown or

14:37.341 --> 14:40.583
something like that.

14:43.926 --> 14:50.292
During any of your years, describe your 
hitchhiking experiences. Where did you catch the

14:50.525 --> 14:52.147
ride? Give some examples of pleasant or 
unpleasant experiences with hitchhiking. Well,

14:59.035 --> 15:01.678
we had a very definite rule. You couldn't upstage. 
For instance, if you hitchhiked north, you had to

15:05.763 --> 15:18.118
go out here to the north gate, and you put your 
suitcase down in line, and you worked your way up,

15:05.763 --> 15:18.118
and they took how many? Or you could go into Bryan, 
there was a place there. The same way in Dallas, the

15:21.576 --> 15:24.700
same way in Houston. Where was the Dallas place to 
catch a ride? It's going out Lamar Boulevard,

15:27.603 --> 15:33.509
about where the soap factory is and this sort of 
thing. You couldn't hitchhike any, you couldn't

15:33.930 --> 15:38.335
go any further upstream than that. You couldn't be 
an upstreamer. And normally you allowed how long

15:42.039 --> 15:47.785
to go from Dallas to College Station? It's hard to 
say. Sometimes you spent on the road all night. Did

15:54.347 --> 15:57.390
you ever have any unpleasant hitchhiking 
experiences? No, I really didn't. I've had it snow

15:59.492 --> 16:05.018
on us coming back from Dallas. Usually you tried to 
hitchhike probably down 75, which is now 45, to

16:05.378 --> 16:17.451
Madisonville, and you hitchhiked over from 
Madisonville or from San Antonio and you'd go up

16:18.005 --> 16:20.928
through Austin that way and come across. You'd 
almost have to go and hitchhike across to Hearn

16:20.968 --> 16:28.775
because there just wasn't any traffic straight 
across to Austin. I have not yet interviewed

16:30.136 --> 16:36.262
anyone who had a negative hitchhiking 
experience. About hitchhiking? In all my

16:37.483 --> 16:44.390
experience, I don't think anybody had any 
problems at all. I've not yet found anyone who did.

16:47.493 --> 16:47.893
No? What about some pranks, some good bull that you 
remember during your student days, whether you

16:48.717 --> 16:56.147
were involved or not? In what? Describe some good 
bulls, some pranks, some jokes that students

16:57.569 --> 17:03.437
played on Sunday. Well, I don't think we were as bad 
as some, but what happened was it snowed. So this

17:11.088 --> 17:18.218
was the opportunity then for the freshmen to take 
the sophomores, take their clothes off and throw

17:11.088 --> 17:18.218
them in the snow. Well, it hadn't snowed the year 
before, so we got to throw the juniors in the snow,

17:18.991 --> 17:24.958
too. Now, did they retaliate? No, they didn't. It 
was just good bull, you might say. They put up with

17:33.927 --> 17:35.209
it. Did you all ever have any imaginative 
drown-outs or anything like that? Oh, yeah, there

17:39.994 --> 17:44.619
was always drown-outs, particularly some 
freshman that you didn't like. He was so adept at

17:45.440 --> 17:47.462
it, he could... His name was Tom Robb, and we've 
never seen him since that. I don't know what it was.

17:55.283 --> 17:58.146
He was kind of a negative personality. But, oh, we 
had drownouts.

18:07.216 --> 18:10.160
How did your life change your sophomore year? 
Compare sophomore Aggie life to freshman. Well,

18:14.084 --> 18:17.888
of course, then we were hazed to freshman, and... 
We were still under the juniors and seniors, but we

18:18.070 --> 18:24.458
didn't really get any study out of them 
particularly. At the end of our sophomore year,

18:24.478 --> 18:30.625
the juniors picked a best drill cadet. And the 
reason for this is that he became the first

18:31.727 --> 18:41.999
sergeant next year as a junior, and then he became 
the company commander as a senior. So this was the

18:42.820 --> 18:47.706
steps in which he went through the ranks and this 
sort of thing. The,

18:49.171 --> 19:01.565
as a sophomore, though, what, what were you, what 
did you do, what were your particular concerns

18:49.171 --> 19:01.565
with the freshmen? Oh, just keep them in line, you 
might say. As time went on, the war had started

19:04.888 --> 19:15.600
then, and pretty soon, and by the time I became 
company commander, I mean, many of them had left

19:15.952 --> 19:21.899
already, and I just pretty well got a lot of that 
stuff cut out. I mean, it's kind of childish, you

19:22.660 --> 19:28.107
might say, immaturity and this sort of thing. And 
so these things kind of dropped off. Now, you're

19:32.032 --> 19:35.235
here two years, 39-40 and 40-41? Oh, I stayed until 
the fall of 42. I was in my fourth year, but I didn't

19:38.279 --> 19:41.583
graduate. In fact, what happened, When the war 
broke out after two years, then we went to summer

19:45.179 --> 19:52.147
school. And so after the third year starting, then 
we went all summer school. And so our seniors had

19:59.135 --> 20:09.446
gone to summer camp as part of their ROTC contract 
to get their commission. And so then when they

20:10.767 --> 20:13.971
finished four years, Even though they didn't get 
their degree, they got their commission and went

20:14.407 --> 20:18.774
on into the service. Up until that time, you had to 
have a degree before you got that. And so far as we

20:23.021 --> 20:34.940
were concerned then, we went to summer school all 
that summer in 42, and then the fall semester in 43,

20:23.021 --> 20:34.940
we pretty well finished up in December. I didn't. I 
went in to get a student. So we got on to OCS. Well,

20:40.293 --> 20:45.598
some of us had their commission, and two of them at 
least said, I don't want to go to the FCS. So they

20:46.099 --> 20:48.641
just took direct commissions in the Navy. And so by 
that time, so many of them had dropped out of

20:49.422 --> 20:53.686
school. If they didn't have a contract, they were 
subject to the draft. And so many of them went ahead

20:57.630 --> 21:01.674
and joined up, particularly as pilots. A lot of 
them went in the Air Force, the Wild Blue Yonder and

21:02.094 --> 21:06.478
all that stuff. And this is where my only 
classmates that were lost in the war had gone into

21:10.415 --> 21:16.182
the service, and they were killed as part of their 
action training. Go back, you got here just as

21:16.243 --> 21:21.830
World War II started. That's right. Were you and 
your classmates, did you all, in the fall of 39, did

21:23.292 --> 21:31.382
you all talk much about what was happening in 
Europe? Oh, of course, we were concerned, and yet

21:31.402 --> 21:35.848
it still seemed to be remote. It wasn't until we got 
into the war in December that we really realized

21:36.453 --> 21:44.943
how serious everything was for us. I presume one of 
the big events in the fall of 1939 was A&M football.

21:51.550 --> 21:54.894
Yes, we were national champions. That's 60 years 
ago. That's the first time we ever won. It's also

21:58.157 --> 22:00.100
the last time we ever won. I went to the Sugar Bowl.

22:04.825 --> 22:05.886
Describe that trip. Oh, okay. Well, my daddy was in 
Houston at the time doing some business, so I rode

22:07.028 --> 22:26.106
the train to Houston, and then he joined me, and we 
went over on the train to the Sugar Bowl game, and we

22:07.028 --> 22:26.106
went to the Sugar Bowl game together, stayed 
together over there, and then we came back, and we

22:07.028 --> 22:26.106
came on back home. So, oh, we found a room there 
somewhere, and then ate at Antoine's, I think.

22:33.873 --> 22:34.894
It's still there. And that was the extent of it, and 
it was a nice trip. Did you wear your uniform? Oh,

22:40.907 --> 22:42.249
yeah, I wore the uniform. In fact, we wore the 
uniform all the time. Once you got home, you'd get

22:44.332 --> 22:51.823
out of uniform, but in general, you always 
hitchhiked in the uniform because it was easier to

22:44.332 --> 22:51.823
get a ride. At the Sugar Bowl game, I presume that 
y'all, all kinds of Aggie traditions of standing

22:53.706 --> 23:05.083
up and yells and all of that, that was a Oh, yes, this 
was current then as we stood up during all the

23:05.283 --> 23:18.079
games, but out-of-town games, it depended on the 
size of us, whether the rest of the crowd would let

23:05.283 --> 23:18.079
us stand up or not. You don't recall what the ticket 
cost, do you? What, what? The Sugar Bowl ticket. I

23:22.464 --> 23:23.565
wonder what it cost. I don't know, but I've got a 
program from that game. A couple of dollars, I

23:28.471 --> 23:30.814
imagine. The... Did you get acquainted with any of 
the heroes of that football team? Okay. At the

23:38.784 --> 23:45.434
second semester of my freshman year, I took 
Chemistry 102 under Tom Harrington. I was in his

23:45.755 --> 23:51.023
class, and the guy that sat right next in front of me 
was Ernie Pannell. Pannell. He was a tackle. And he

23:54.693 --> 23:57.317
was taking freshman chemistry. Here he was, a 
junior. So I kind of got acquainted with him. But

24:01.142 --> 24:04.446
that's really, I didn't have much acquainted with 
him. Because they all lived in Domitory 12. This is

24:07.591 --> 24:09.113
the athletic dorm. So that's where the athletes 
lived. But officially, they were in the Corps?

24:14.520 --> 24:15.722
Well, they were all in the Corps. And they wore 
their uniforms to class. Oh, yeah. Describe

24:19.367 --> 24:23.232
Professor Harrington and his course and Describe 
him as a teacher and a faculty member. Well, of

24:26.551 --> 24:30.096
course he was a good instructor. At that time he was 
a prof, and later on that he moved on up. But he

24:35.924 --> 24:43.735
didn't, you've got three times a week in a small 
classroom, once a week in the large lecture room.

24:43.855 --> 24:50.805
Once in a while he would lecture there, but usually 
it was a more senior professor would lecture in

24:43.855 --> 24:50.805
chemistry. I can't think of his name now, but 
anyway. Did you all have a nickname for Dr.

24:54.624 --> 24:57.207
Harrington? I can't remember that, no. Most profs 
did have one, though. My own electrical

25:01.113 --> 25:04.097
engineering profs all had nicknames. Every prof 
on the campus almost had one. Share some of those.

25:08.263 --> 25:11.888
Well, there was Dutch Dillingham, because he was a 
Dutchman. There was Rabbi Markle. He looked

25:13.870 --> 25:17.736
Jewish, so they called him Rabbi. Pappy Foraker. 
Firecracker Road, Bear Tracks Bolton, and a

25:20.215 --> 25:37.051
four-acre son became the dean of the business 
administration. And he came back for this reunion

25:37.091 --> 25:48.923
when I had all the signal core over here to the 
house, and so he and his wife came over and we had a

25:37.091 --> 25:48.923
real nice visit. He was also honored with a 
scholarship, and also his wife. Her father was a

25:54.352 --> 26:02.541
civil engineering prop, and he was known as Shaky 
Orr because he had a trimmer. But anyway, he came

26:02.561 --> 26:11.971
back for that, and they asked me to talk about the 
father, and Foiker was so nice to me afterwards.

26:12.352 --> 26:13.833
And then he came over here. Well, of course, all 
these guys that had the daddy in class, And so they

26:18.130 --> 26:22.415
told lots of stories about his father and this sort 
of thing. And he was on the golf team while he was

26:22.915 --> 26:25.178
here. And he said when he was a kid, he would come 
over and sit on the steps of Bolton Hall until his

26:25.238 --> 26:33.146
daddy finished class for the day. And then he would 
go home with him because he lived off campus. And he

26:37.111 --> 26:41.235
just died in the past year of pneumonia. Describe 
where most of your classes were held. What

26:46.581 --> 26:47.462
buildings? Of course, Bolton Hall was electrical 
engineering. Next door to it is mechanical

26:52.197 --> 26:55.623
engineering, Fermier Hall. And then the academic 
building is where we had most of all of our other

26:56.404 --> 27:02.474
courses. Civil engineering was across from 
Enagle Hall. That's where civil engineering was.

27:09.987 --> 27:14.052
And then the mechanical engineering had shop 
building next door. And so we had our steam lab, our

27:14.072 --> 27:20.941
lab courses over there, a machine shop, and this 
sort of thing. So most all of them were right there

27:21.602 --> 27:25.888
in those buildings right there. The chemistry was 
down in the... Chemistry was in its building, of

27:25.908 --> 27:29.813
course. And physics. And physics was over in its 
building. What about math? And math was in the

27:33.959 --> 27:35.941
academic building. All the courses were in the 
academic building for math. and for English and

27:39.063 --> 27:41.667
for history and for government. What about some 
English teachers? English? Well, there's old

27:45.633 --> 27:56.230
Brooks Cofer's daddy, which we called Dusty 
Cofer, John Paul Abbott. What was his nickname?

27:58.413 --> 28:01.558
John Paul Abbott, he just went by that, yeah. But 
then there was, for history, was a guy named Count

28:01.578 --> 28:05.965
Segarra. Segarff was a Hungarian, I believe, but 
anyway, he was called Count Segarff. And I

28:11.912 --> 28:22.029
remember one day, this guy was quoting from the 
history book, and he quoted from it, and he says,

28:11.912 --> 28:22.029
where did you get that? I says, from the history 
book. He says, well, throw it out the window. So the

28:25.956 --> 28:30.103
guy threw it out the window. Yeah, of course, the 
egg. They were all good profs, I felt like. They

28:34.983 --> 28:35.624
really were. The math, I had Klippel way back there 
and people like that. Describe

28:40.930 --> 28:47.957
the routine of typical Aggie classes. How did the 
students behave? How did the faculty member

28:51.721 --> 28:55.465
conduct the class and so forth? I can never 
remember any disturbance of any kind in any of

28:55.485 --> 29:00.690
those classes, yeah. What if a student went to 
sleep? Did a student dare go to sleep in class? I

29:07.727 --> 29:08.608
guess they did. I don't remember. I don't think I 
did. Was the faculty available out of class if you

29:11.452 --> 29:16.740
wanted to go talk to them? I can't remember. I 
didn't use them that much. Really, it's

29:21.507 --> 29:23.270
surprising. Most of the faculty and staff lived on 
campus, didn't they? Well, I'd say a smaller and

29:29.493 --> 29:43.886
smaller percentage, because in 1939, the board 
said we've got to get all these houses off campus,

29:29.493 --> 29:43.886
and by 1942, they would all be moved off. So this is 
the way it turned out. Because when I interviewed,

29:48.891 --> 29:56.698
when I chatted with Henry Gilchrist, he told me 
that in 1937, when they arrived, the A&M

29:57.337 --> 30:05.890
Consolidated School District was about to finish 
their new building on the south side of Jersey

29:57.337 --> 30:05.890
Street and move it off campus. In 1939, they were 
still in Pfeiffer Hall and the Music Hall. And

30:11.278 --> 30:18.669
within the next year, they had moved over to what is 
now George Bush Drive. As you look back on your

30:20.231 --> 30:26.280
student academic days, What were the emphasis, 
what was the emphasis for you as an electrical

30:27.543 --> 30:35.172
engineer? What were they preparing you for? Oh, it 
was mostly power. You had a course in

30:42.101 --> 30:54.276
communication which would be used both for 
telethy and power systems, but by and large we took

30:42.101 --> 30:54.276
the circuits, and in the spring we'd take the DC 
machinery, and then AC circuits in your junior

30:54.678 --> 31:10.433
year, and you'd get into transmission, and you 
took a course in economics.

31:11.855 --> 31:18.761
The senior year was both machinery courses, and 
each one had an extensive lab. And so we really

31:19.762 --> 31:23.105
weren't getting much into electronics at all. We 
did have a I liked Donnie's course, but it was all

31:24.260 --> 31:29.391
vacuum tubes, and you could see how limited it was 
there. It's unbelievable what's happened. In the

31:31.817 --> 31:43.703
early 1960s, Dr. Bolton and I went to Houston back 
for a meeting, and when he got out of the car, he

31:31.817 --> 31:43.703
says, I have seen so much happen in the past 50 
years.
