WEBVTT

00:02.528 --> 00:04.390
June the 4th, 1896. We are in College Station, 
Texas, in the offices of the Chemical Engineering

00:04.470 --> 00:09.656
Department. Ron, could you tell me a little bit 
about your personal biography, your background,

00:09.676 --> 00:17.445
how you came to be at Texas A&M?

00:21.690 --> 00:28.958
Hey, Ron, it's June the 6th, Wednesday, June the 
6th, 1996. And you're talking about the history

00:29.630 --> 00:34.455
and development of the Department of Chemical 
Engineering. And if you would, would you please

00:35.056 --> 00:47.489
tell me your name for the record and a little 
biographical information about your upbringing

00:35.056 --> 00:47.489
and your early education and how you finally got to 
A&M? OK. Ron Darby. I was born on September 12,

00:50.953 --> 00:57.240
1932, in La Vida, Colorado. My father was 
actually, he was an educator at the time. He was

01:01.290 --> 01:05.194
teaching school, but later became more of a 
traveling salesman. So we moved a lot in my early

01:05.395 --> 01:08.097
years. In fact, I never lived in any one place more 
than three years until I went to college. But I went

01:13.623 --> 01:15.785
to grade school. In fact, I lived in Bryan in 1938, 
39, and went to grade school here one semester in

01:15.845 --> 01:26.957
Bryan back then. Did most of my grade schooling in 
Houston, a little bit in Waco, and then junior high

01:27.292 --> 01:40.788
in Beaumont, some in Houston and Beaumont, and 
then moved to Atlanta, Georgia for high school.

01:41.489 --> 01:44.853
Graduated from high school in Atlanta in 1950. And 
then I applied for the Naval ROTC program when I was

01:45.734 --> 01:52.843
in high school, and it's a scholarship program. 
And you have to put down a choice of where you want to

01:53.161 --> 01:57.908
go to school, three choices for second and third. 
And I'd actually put down Georgia Tech and Rice and

01:58.489 --> 02:02.535
Duke in that order. But then I got to thinking I'd 
want to come back to Texas. So I went down and

02:05.699 --> 02:12.068
changed my preference and put down Rice first and 
then Georgia Tech and Duke. So I ended up going to

02:12.088 --> 02:13.971
Rice. It's different. You know, that's why I went 
to Texas in ROTC. Is that right? Sure is. I got there

02:18.457 --> 02:21.640
in 52. That was exactly the reason. Tulane, I 
think, had ROTC in Louisiana. You go to high school

02:28.848 --> 02:29.989
in Louisiana? Yeah. Well, if I hadn't changed my 
mind, I'd have gone to Georgia Tech. Of course, I'd

02:36.235 --> 02:39.439
grown up a lot in Houston, and I wanted to go back to 
Texas. So I went to Rice on an ROTC scholarship.

02:42.925 --> 02:51.138
There was a five-year engineering BS program at 
the time, so it was five years for a BS degree. And,

02:51.158 --> 02:57.728
of course, the rules of the ROTC were that as soon as 
you get a degree, you have to get your commission

02:51.158 --> 02:57.728
and go on active duty. And Rice normally gave a BA 
after four years and a BS after five years, so I had

02:58.389 --> 03:10.367
to delay the BA degree until after my fifth year so I 
wouldn't have to go on active duty. So at the end of

03:10.668 --> 03:16.397
my fifth year, I got a BA and a BS and a commission all 
at the same time. Where'd you go? Well, I went on

03:17.378 --> 03:20.924
destroyers in the Pacific. Actually, before I 
graduated, I had a round of interviews because I

03:21.464 --> 03:29.917
wanted to pin down a job to go to, and I got out of the 
Navy. So I talked to companies all over the

03:29.937 --> 03:35.826
country, mostly East Coast and West Coast and 
Texas and Oklahoma. And I picked a job with Dow

03:36.487 --> 03:39.612
Chemical in Freeport. And I actually went down 
there for about three weeks before I had to report

03:39.878 --> 03:45.946
to my ship after I graduated. And so I had kind of an 
orientation program. At that time, you'd have,

03:49.310 --> 03:57.600
actually, you were on their rolls, so you had three 
years of longevity for your Navy service. It was

03:57.781 --> 03:59.623
three years after duty. That's right, three 
years, because you were a full-time sergeant. I

04:02.366 --> 04:02.967
had two years. And in fact, being the destroyers in 
the Pacific, I requested destroyers in the

04:03.267 --> 04:08.413
Pacific. I remember I got courier duty in the 
Atlantic in the National Naval Air Force. Is that

04:14.020 --> 04:14.300
right? Which was really great, but still, that's 
not what I'd asked for. Well, that's what I'd asked

04:16.963 --> 04:18.925
for, and I got it. So anyway, I was reported to a 
destroyer, a structure class destroyer in San

04:18.945 --> 04:28.677
Diego in 1955 when I graduated. And I was on that for 
a couple of years with... Two or three trips to

04:32.765 --> 04:48.751
Westpac, I was electronics officer and officer of 
the deck, CIC officer, all in operations on the

04:32.765 --> 04:48.751
destroyer, and also a navigator. In fact, I was 
officer of the deck for general quarters and had a

04:48.771 --> 04:54.520
division officer and navigator. ended up 
relieving myself on the watch more often than not.

04:59.310 --> 04:59.771
It was good. It was a good experience. I really 
enjoyed it. Two or three trips to Westpac. On one of

05:04.937 --> 05:11.785
them, we went to Brisbane, Australia, and we were 
the first ships since the end of World War II into

05:04.937 --> 05:11.785
Brisbane. And the Australians really went all 
out. We had more parties to go to than we had people

05:14.188 --> 05:18.112
to go to in Brisbane. It was a lot of fun. And then, of 
course, the usual Hong Kong, Philippines, Japan,

05:25.246 --> 05:27.149
and so forth. What was that, the big base in Japan? 
Yakuska. Yakuska. Yeah, in and out of Yakuska and

05:30.695 --> 05:34.961
Kobe.

05:36.804 --> 05:43.695
But then after a couple years on that, I was 
transferred to a commissioning detail for a radar

05:36.804 --> 05:43.695
picket ship. Her ship was the Chandler 717. Of 
course, Charlie Holland had been in the Navy,

05:45.538 --> 05:49.785
so... He liked to tell some stories, too. But 
anyway, the Chandler, this was the Newell 322, was

05:52.879 --> 06:08.323
originally a World War II destroyer escort that 
had been mothballed and then resurrected in Korea

05:52.879 --> 06:08.323
as a weather ship to the Coast Guard. And then it was 
mothballed again in Florida. And then they towed

06:11.928 --> 06:16.515
it around to Long Beach and put it in commission as a 
radar picket ship. And I was the CIC officer there

06:17.440 --> 06:24.129
in charge of all the electronics equipment and the 
radars and all of that. And we had, at the time, the

06:24.149 --> 06:26.933
state-of-the-art radars. Of course, the 
long-range air search radars, the objective was

06:26.953 --> 06:35.545
to serve picket duty out in the Pacific for 
long-range search. Were you offshore a lot? Well,

06:39.250 --> 06:43.937
I spent about six months in Long Beach putting the 
thing in commission. And then it was stationed at

06:43.957 --> 06:46.300
Pearl Harbor. So I was at Pearl for six months. And 
during that period, we had one picket tour, which

06:49.706 --> 06:54.932
really ran from Midway to Kodiak, Alaska. So we ran 
back and forth there for about three weeks. And

06:59.556 --> 07:03.661
then that's the only tour I had before I got out. And 
then when I got out, I got out in May of 58. And

07:07.765 --> 07:14.852
meanwhile, I decided I wanted to go back to 
graduate school because a lot of stuff that I'd

07:07.765 --> 07:14.852
like to know, I didn't know. and I wanted to get more 
training and education. So I wrote to Dow and asked

07:17.713 --> 07:20.837
them... Excuse me, your degree from Rice, your 
B.S. was in... Chemical Engineering. Chemical

07:24.460 --> 07:24.961
Engineering. So actually I have a B.A. and a B.S. in 
Rice. The B.A. is undesignated, but the B.S. is

07:31.307 --> 07:33.169
here. So I wrote to Dow and asked them if I could just 
come down and work for the summer until classes

07:33.189 --> 07:39.796
started in September. And they said, yeah, that's 
okay, no problem. So I went down there the first of

07:41.858 --> 07:45.261
June, reported for work, And they called me in, and 
this was in 1958, and that was the biggest downturn

07:45.798 --> 07:54.893
the chemical industry has ever had. I mean, before 
or since, that was the recession. And Dow had been

07:58.679 --> 08:05.670
given a mandate to lay off 10% of the employees 
across the board in every division. So they called

08:05.690 --> 08:08.474
me and said, look, we're laying people off. We 
really can't take you on this summer. We're very

08:10.978 --> 08:11.940
sorry. Here's $300 severance pay. Good luck. So 
they sent me home with $300 in my pocket. And I went

08:18.914 --> 08:25.584
back to Houston, and I got a job that summer working 
for Bill Akers, who was head of the kidney

08:18.914 --> 08:25.584
department at Rice. He had a consulting project 
having to do with heat transfer and heavy oils in

08:26.085 --> 08:32.295
him, too. So me and another student worked on that 
that summer, and it was a good experience. I

08:37.064 --> 08:42.912
remember when I was a student, my students were 
geology, I guess, exploration. Yeah, it hit them

08:43.172 --> 08:44.635
hard. Oh, there was no marketplace then. That's 
right. It really wiped it out. But anyway, I was in

08:51.104 --> 08:56.992
graduate school at Rice then until 61. I finished 
all my work actually in late 60, in the fall of 60.

09:05.600 --> 09:27.962
finished it actually in october got married in 
december and i got married in november and in

09:05.600 --> 09:27.962
december my wife and i left on a freighter for 
england i applied for a nsf postdoc scholarship

09:05.600 --> 09:27.962
which i got for a year in england in cambridge and 
they gave a total of six cents travel for one person

09:28.533 --> 09:31.236
to get to where you were going. So I shopped around 
for the cheapest way to get to England, which was a

09:31.677 --> 09:35.201
freighter. So I booked us on a Lykes freighter to go 
to England, which was an experience. The rules

09:42.550 --> 09:54.805
said that you had to leave from the last US port and 
get off at the first UK port, but they wouldn't tell

09:42.550 --> 09:54.805
you where that was because it's basically 
unscheduled, so you have to change at the last

09:42.550 --> 09:54.805
minute. And sure enough, this freighter was 
supposed to leave from Galveston, but they

09:58.233 --> 10:03.120
changed their schedule and they went to 
Galveston, but they had to go to Corpus to pick up

09:58.233 --> 10:03.120
some freight. So we had to, even though we were in 
Houston, the freighter was in Galveston, we had to

10:03.660 --> 10:09.248
go to Corpus to get on the ship. And it was a two-week 
trip from Corpus to Liverpool. And we got to

10:15.877 --> 10:20.503
Liverpool in the middle of December and then went 
to Cambridge. And that was a fun time. I did a

10:22.246 --> 10:25.590
research project there with a fellow on nuclear 
oil. studying the rate of growth of bubbles in a

10:26.212 --> 10:37.793
nuclear boiling system. And that was my first kind 
of independent research project. And that was a

10:44.785 --> 10:45.727
lot of fun. We traveled around, took a couple trips 
on the continent and all, bought a British car, The

10:50.714 --> 10:57.122
place we went, they thought we were British, so 
that was... One year. Yeah, exactly a year. Came

10:58.765 --> 11:02.590
back the following December, and it was a really 
cold year. We had a flat in Cambridge that was

11:02.650 --> 11:18.190
heated electrically, and our electric bills were 
kind of high, and we asked our landlady why they

11:02.650 --> 11:18.190
were so high, and my wife did, and the landlady 
says, well, my dear... can I ask you a personal

11:18.760 --> 11:20.822
question? She said, well, I guess so. She said, 
well, just how often do you bathe? We had an

11:23.986 --> 11:26.929
electrified water heater and everything. She 
says, well, we bathe every day. She says, my dear,

11:29.372 --> 11:34.617
don't you realize you're washing all the natural 
oils out of your skin? I think once a week is a norm.

11:37.801 --> 11:41.545
So anyway, she was a great landlady. When we left 
there, actually, she owed us a little return on our

11:48.393 --> 11:53.700
deposit, which she sent a check for pounds, which I 
couldn't negotiate in the bank. So I sent it back to

11:54.121 --> 11:58.467
her and asked her if she would use, please use that 
money to buy me a book. And I told her what book I

11:58.487 --> 11:59.789
wanted. She did. She bought the book and she sent it 
to me. So it was a long time. But then after I came

12:04.656 --> 12:17.093
back from England, I, actually before I went to 
England, before I knew that I had the NSF post-doc

12:04.656 --> 12:17.093
scholarship, I had gone through some interviews 
to pin down a job. And I concentrated mostly on

12:18.700 --> 12:45.703
texas and oklahoma at that time but then when i got 
the scholarship and i went to england i came back

12:18.700 --> 12:45.703
and i had another round of interviews so that's my 
third interviewing round and i i took a job with

12:18.700 --> 12:45.703
lean temp cobalt ltv research center in grand 
prairie and that was during jimmy lane's heyday

12:18.700 --> 12:45.703
you probably remember jimmy lane he was notorious 
they say that jimmy lane never actually graduated

12:18.700 --> 12:45.703
from high school But he put together such 
complicated financing deals with all these

12:46.325 --> 12:54.916
companies that he bought and sold that a lot of 
people couldn't understand that it was so

12:46.325 --> 12:54.916
complicated. And a lot of people wondered if Jimmy 
understood it himself. But he was an amazing guy.

13:00.663 --> 13:02.546
So he was on the same deal with you? Oh, yeah. I met 
Jimmy. I talked to Jimmy. And he was an interesting

13:05.529 --> 13:07.532
guy. But I was working on the fuel cell research at 
the time. LTV, of course, in the space and aircraft

13:12.717 --> 13:23.110
business, wanted to have some expertise in fuel 
cells, even though they didn't have any

13:12.717 --> 13:23.110
production facilities for them. They needed to 
keep abreast of that technology, so that's

13:23.130 --> 13:26.614
basically why I was doing that. But one year, LTV 
would decide they were going to diversify, so

13:27.895 --> 13:39.069
Jimmy went out and he bought up Friedrich Air 
Conditioners and a bunch of other companies that

13:27.895 --> 13:39.069
didn't necessarily relate to aerospace. Then the 
next year, they decided they were going to

13:39.610 --> 13:42.353
specialize So they sold off all these companies to 
concentrate on government business. So it was

13:47.049 --> 13:49.032
going back and forth. Yeah, I remember watching 
the LTV. Yeah, it was Wheeler Dealer. In fact,

13:55.120 --> 14:01.688
Jimmy Lane made his, the word was that he made his 
fortune in World War II. He was an electrical

14:01.728 --> 14:11.260
contractor, and he bought up a lot of surplus 
aluminum cables from Chance Law Aircraft Company

14:01.728 --> 14:11.260
at like pennies on the dollar. and he made a killing 
by marketing that cable, and he ended up buying the

14:11.678 --> 14:20.930
company he bought the cable from. I've heard 
people doing that with iron, you know, just all

14:20.950 --> 14:24.895
iron. Yeah, scrap iron. But anyway, when I was in 
graduate school at Rice, Leo Durbin and I and two

14:27.719 --> 14:39.795
other graduate students roomed together in a 
two-bedroom apartment, So Leo and I shared one

14:40.484 --> 14:45.870
bedroom, and the other two guys shared another 
bedroom. And Leo graduated, he started the year

14:45.890 --> 14:56.281
before I did, and he graduated a little earlier 
than I did, and he wanted to go into teaching. So Leo

14:56.361 --> 15:03.549
actually wanted to go to work for the University of 
Texas, and he went over and he had an interview with

14:56.361 --> 15:03.549
John McKetta. And John is really an interesting 
guy. Everybody loves John. But John always said

15:07.953 --> 15:09.495
later, that he really wanted to hire Leo except 
during the interview Leo went to sleep when he was

15:09.627 --> 15:34.707
talking to them and so he couldn't he couldn't 
offer him a job because he went to sleep during the

15:09.627 --> 15:34.707
interview but anyway Leo was hired here played 
back huh yeah John McKetta M-C-K-E-T-T-A yeah

15:09.627 --> 15:34.707
John McKetta he's a classic over there He's still 
active. He's retired, but he's still... He

15:38.510 --> 15:41.793
recently gave a million dollars to the community 
department. Who was that? He gave them a big party

15:42.494 --> 15:45.437
and all that. He was editor of a book series, and I 
published my first book, so I knew him. But anyway,

15:51.423 --> 15:55.647
Leo was hired here at A&M while I was off in England. 
I was working here. When I went to work for LTV, I

15:57.468 --> 16:04.255
wrote up a paper on the research that I did in 
England on nuclear boiling. and published it in

16:04.876 --> 16:08.941
Chemical Engineering Science. And Leo saw the 
paper, and they were looking for a new faculty

16:08.961 --> 16:18.012
member, so Leo put my name in the pod with Lindsey 
and Holland. So Holland called me, and I'd always

16:18.212 --> 16:24.079
kind of wanted to get into teaching. In fact, even 
when I was in the Navy, I set up kind of some

16:24.099 --> 16:33.010
instruction courses for the electronics 
technicians to try to teach them some basic

16:24.099 --> 16:33.010
electricity and stuff. And I enjoyed all that, so I 
really wanted to get into it. So, but really, it was

16:37.962 --> 16:40.626
not your initiative so much. No, that's right. I 
just got a call out of the blue one day from Leo

16:41.667 --> 16:47.315
wanting to know if I was interested in a teaching 
job. Let me back up. When you were interviewing

16:48.657 --> 16:52.322
that person in his early years out of Rice, what 
were you looking at? What was happening, going on

16:52.342 --> 16:56.988
in Texas that particularly related to chemical 
engineers? Well, I guess that was kind of a heyday

16:57.108 --> 17:03.317
of chemical engineering in a way, because the 
chemical engineers were The cream of the crop of

17:03.652 --> 17:09.140
the students in most universities, they were top 
notch and getting the best jobs. And the chemical

17:09.220 --> 17:12.926
industry was really mushrooming all over the 
place. It was in really a growth mode. And

17:15.550 --> 17:21.279
actually, I was looking more for location than 
specific jobs. I had interviews all the way from

17:21.419 --> 17:31.414
Standard Oil in New Jersey and DuPont in Delaware 
to Chevron in California. Dow and Texaco, mostly

17:31.732 --> 17:39.224
petroleum oil companies and petrochemical 
companies. I talked with Dow. I had several job

17:40.125 --> 17:46.175
offers from Exxon and Texaco. A lot of them were 
petroleum production areas and those were like

17:46.195 --> 17:52.585
engineering and stuff like that. In fact, when I 
went to work for I kind of like the Dallas area, so my

17:55.795 --> 18:01.684
last rounds I was kind of concentrating on Dallas 
or Oklahoma. I like Dallas and Tulsa, so I kind of

18:01.704 --> 18:06.312
concentrated on companies in those two towns. And 
I had a job offer from Mobile Field Research

18:06.933 --> 18:15.065
Laboratory outside of Dallas in Duncanville, 
which was a nice job. I was really torn between that

18:15.085 --> 18:17.529
and LTV. But LTV looked a little more exotic, a 
little different. Yeah, very, very. Yeah, a

18:22.237 --> 18:23.018
little more. avant-garde, I guess, or whatever, 
so I thought I'd try that, which may or may not have

18:23.318 --> 18:29.726
been a good thing. I published two or three papers 
on the work that I did up there, so it came out okay on

18:30.106 --> 18:38.917
the fuel cell stuff I was doing, mostly on 
theoretical models and stuff. But then I got this

18:39.738 --> 18:45.225
call from Leo, and so I decided to follow up on it, 
and came down for an interview, and They offered me

18:45.627 --> 18:51.075
the job, so I decided to take it. Did you take a pay 
cut? Yeah, I did. I would think so. Yeah, I took, I

18:55.101 --> 18:56.483
guess, about 20% pay cut when I came here tonight. 
So that was it. Was that a good idea? Well, she

18:58.987 --> 19:01.611
pretty well went along with what I wanted. 
Meanwhile, we had our first child was born in

19:02.032 --> 19:06.238
Dallas. She was born... just about a week before 
Kennedy was killed. And then we moved from there in

19:12.471 --> 19:20.760
65.

19:23.663 --> 19:33.975
Then we

19:23.663 --> 19:33.975
had another one after we came here in 66. Second, 
Her son was born in April of 66, and we've got two

19:35.189 --> 19:40.175
kids. My wife died of cancer in 89, and my kids now 
are growing and growing. Where are they now? Well,

19:46.824 --> 19:51.570
my daughter is married, and she and her husband are 
in graduate school at Virginia Tech. She got an

19:52.371 --> 20:02.884
accounting degree here, and then they both worked 
for a while in Florida, and she picked up an MBA

19:52.371 --> 20:02.884
degree at Florida Atlantic University over 
there. And they decided they wanted to get into

20:03.286 --> 20:05.810
academic English. I had never suspected. Yeah, 
you never know about that. My son's just moved here

20:10.095 --> 20:12.299
this past year. He's working with me in education. 
Is that right? Well, my daughter wanted to. I

20:15.803 --> 20:17.185
thought he wanted to be a coach. Yeah. Well, that's 
what my son wants to do. In fact, he got his degree

20:18.788 --> 20:26.018
here in kinesiology and a minor in biology. And he 
always wanted to be a basketball player. Carl did.

20:29.282 --> 20:32.106
And he coached me back at Coppell. Did he? couple of 
years and did a nice job. His wife didn't like it up

20:35.503 --> 20:41.130
there. Well, my son moved to Houston, got a job in a 
junior high school in the Spring School of

20:41.150 --> 20:51.662
History, Spring Bank School of History, which was 
actually mostly a minority area. But he coached

20:51.682 --> 20:55.386
basketball and some football. And then he got 
married to a girl who had a master's degree in

20:55.887 --> 21:02.014
veterinary pharmacology here in Houston. And she 
was working with MD Anderson down there at the

21:02.315 --> 21:05.499
time. And she got a good job offer from Eli Willey up 
in Indiana, just outside of Indianapolis. So they

21:12.089 --> 21:14.772
moved up there. And actually, they split up last 
year, about a year ago. So he's on his own. He's

21:21.201 --> 21:23.304
still up there in Greenfield. He's outside of 
Indianapolis. He taught for a while there. In

21:26.829 --> 21:30.955
fact, he had one year in the Indianapolis School 
District in the inner city school. which was a pure

21:31.255 --> 21:33.219
nightmare. I mean, the kids were wild, 
uncontrolled, no discipline, and it was just

21:33.239 --> 21:37.747
terrible. He got out of his class as a kid, but he 
hasn't gotten a permanent teaching job since.

21:42.517 --> 21:47.767
He's been working for the city of Greenfield in 
their recreation department. He supervises

21:47.787 --> 21:50.091
their softball leagues. all their athletic 
competition and stuff like that. Well, I think

21:54.525 --> 21:56.587
he's kind of torn. He kind of likes it there, and 
he's used to it there. He's got a lot of inertia.

22:00.070 --> 22:02.332
He's not very adventurous. He hasn't rejected 
them. It's hard to get a job long distance,

22:05.835 --> 22:10.059
particularly teaching jobs. You pretty well have 
to be on the spot and make a lot of contacts to get in

22:10.079 --> 22:15.964
the system. He's been trying to get back in the 
school system over the years. He also has a second

22:19.180 --> 22:23.446
job with a boys club. So he's got kind of two 
part-time jobs, basically. I bet you he'll get

22:28.051 --> 22:31.195
back in. My daughter always liked the applied 
areas in business. So she wanted to get in a program

22:34.980 --> 22:39.847
where she could teach applications in business. 
She actually taught a little bit in a vocational

22:39.867 --> 22:44.433
program in Florida when she was in there. Then she 
found a program in the voc-ed department at

22:46.653 --> 22:50.817
Virginia Tech that had a business class here. So 
that sounded good to her, so she enrolled in that.

22:54.560 --> 22:56.101
She was in there for a couple years. She actually 
got a doctorate of education degree through that

22:56.141 --> 22:59.304
program. But she was really disappointed with the 
standards in the voc-ed program. She said she had

23:04.809 --> 23:10.694
fellow graduate students that she didn't know 
whether they could walk or chew gum at the same

23:04.809 --> 23:10.694
time. And that was really poor. In fact, since 
then, just about the time she got her degree,

23:15.830 --> 23:23.579
Virginia Tech, as part of their budget control 
procedures, wiped out the College of Education,

23:15.830 --> 23:23.579
the whole college. The whole College of 
Education? Yeah, the whole College of Education.

23:27.364 --> 23:35.414
So meanwhile, she had transferred back into the 
business college, and she's working on a PhD in

23:27.364 --> 23:35.414
strategic management now. And her husband got a 
master's degree here in landscape architecture,

23:35.434 --> 23:43.463
and he's working on a PhD in landscape 
architecture there. And it's kind of ironic

23:44.104 --> 23:45.786
because His father lost his wife to cancer about a 
year before I did. And then he and my daughter got

23:51.558 --> 23:54.804
together and got married. And then his father was 
on the faculty here in architecture, Ralph

23:55.526 --> 24:03.080
Eccleston.

24:03.200 --> 24:07.909
And so he was, in fact, he and I share a common 
birthday. He's three years older than I am, but we

24:08.159 --> 24:15.486
were born on the same day of the year. And he had a 
second marriage, which didn't work out. And I had a

24:18.609 --> 24:21.031
second marriage, which didn't work out. And so he 
actually moved into my house and lived there for a

24:21.572 --> 24:27.478
couple of years with me and my house. He was 
actually on a nine-month appointment, so he went

24:27.498 --> 24:35.165
back to Virginia in the summertime and then 
decided just to go ahead and retire this past year.

24:35.786 --> 24:38.048
So he's back there full-time. His family, and I was 
raised from Virginia, of course, my wife's, his

24:38.922 --> 24:56.301
son, my wife's husband, has got three brothers and 
a sister, and all of them went on the back of

24:38.922 --> 24:56.301
Virginia there, so most of them are family ties. 
Yeah. It's interesting to see what happens to your

24:56.441 --> 24:58.944
kid. Yeah. And you don't know why. Their life is 
more complicated than ours, I think, though, I

25:02.267 --> 25:04.930
don't know. But you kind of ask, why did I get into 
chemical engineering? And I tell students this a

25:09.051 --> 25:10.634
lot. Because when I was in high school, my favorite 
course actually, well, I had three favorite

25:11.497 --> 25:17.231
courses. I liked my mechanical drawing course. I 
had a good chemistry course, and I probably

25:19.979 --> 25:26.109
learned more from the typing course than anything 
else from the practical matter. I had the same

25:26.770 --> 25:27.872
experience. Is that right? I had drawing. I loved 
it. And typing. I had two or three years of drawing.

25:33.882 --> 25:34.343
I loved it. And typing. I was good at typing. My 
typing instructor told me she thought it would be a

25:36.787 --> 25:45.902
good idea if I dropped the class at a certain point 
because she knew I wouldn't be making very good

25:36.787 --> 25:45.902
grades. or something, and so I dropped it. But it 
was a good experience. I got up to over 60 words a

25:50.846 --> 25:57.092
second in that typing course, which just came in a 
lot of really handy. But I was kind of the teacher's

25:57.112 --> 25:59.754
pet in the chemistry course. I'll never forget my 
high school chemistry teacher. His name was

26:02.337 --> 26:05.760
Haichi, very unusual name. Haichi? I think he was 
Slavic or something. H-I-T-C-H-E-W. I'm not sure

26:11.865 --> 26:14.067
exactly. But he was a crusty old character. It was a 
good course. But actually, I envisioned myself as

26:17.867 --> 26:22.372
being mechanically inclined. In fact, I thought 
at one time I wanted to work as an architect. And I

26:26.397 --> 26:29.180
worked one summer when I was in high school for an 
architect. And when I saw what was involved, I

26:29.580 --> 26:33.966
decided I wanted to be an architect, which was 
good. But then when I went to college, I was leaning

26:34.286 --> 26:37.810
toward mechanical engineering. But at Rice, you 
didn't have to prepare a major to your sophomore

26:38.110 --> 26:42.395
year. You just divided people into science, 
engineering, and liberal arts. Two categories.

26:48.022 --> 26:49.945
So I went through the science, engineering route. 
And while I was there, the word around the campus

26:50.385 --> 26:56.052
was that chem engineering was the toughest 
program on the campus. It was the most

26:56.313 --> 26:57.835
challenging. So I said, by God, I think I'll try it 
to see if I can do it. So I got into it more as a

27:00.858 --> 27:03.882
challenge than anything else. Of course, I did 
like my chemistry course, but I wasn't really all

27:04.267 --> 27:09.073
that in love with chemistry. But it was a 
challenge, and I got into it, and I enjoyed it. But

27:13.158 --> 27:17.563
I'm kind of a frustrated mechanical engineer, 
probably more than anything else. I probably use

27:17.583 --> 27:27.896
more physics than chemistry in the stuff I've 
done, because I'm more into fluid mechanics, and

27:17.583 --> 27:27.896
rheology, and viscoelastic materials, and , and 
stuff. There's a lot more physics involved than

27:27.996 --> 27:32.181
chemistry . And in some places, I've been doing 
some background reading, chemical engineering

27:32.617 --> 27:41.069
really came out of physics departments. Some 
places gave them petroleum, and in some places, of

27:41.690 --> 27:48.659
course, a lot of places, as here, chemical 
departments. Well, you know, back when I was in

27:48.679 --> 27:56.430
school, there was not that much of a distinction 
between a physical chemist and a chemical

27:48.679 --> 27:56.430
engineer. In fact, in Europe, they don't make a lot 
of distinction. They have chemical physics and

28:00.937 --> 28:08.326
physical chemistry and chem engineers, and they 
all are more or less the same kind of thing with a

28:00.937 --> 28:08.326
little different slant. They're all very applied 
programming. And physical chemistry used to be an

28:10.830 --> 28:23.346
applied course where you actually learned about 
vapor-liquid equilibrium and surface tension

28:10.830 --> 28:23.346
and diffusivity and practical physical 
properties. And it was a good, useful course for

28:23.596 --> 28:27.021
chemical engineers. But physical chemistry now 
has gotten so esoteric that all they want to do is

28:27.041 --> 28:40.061
talk about spectral analysis, energy levels, 
quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and

28:27.041 --> 28:40.061
things like that. And it doesn't deal so much with 
the tangibles anymore like it used to. Has

28:44.968 --> 28:49.114
chemical engineering changed in its context 
approach and its clientele, let's say, here at

28:49.583 --> 28:53.929
A&M. Chemical engineering hasn't undergone any 
revolutionary, drastic changes. It's undergone

28:59.697 --> 29:06.926
a lot of evolutionary changes, but no real 
revolutionary. Again, of course, there's always

29:06.946 --> 29:09.690
more information. You try to cram more and more 
into the curriculum, but you've got to take

29:09.790 --> 29:14.596
something out when you put something in. So the 
curriculum... Things that used to be taught in

29:17.174 --> 29:23.243
graduate school now are moved down to senior 
level, just like high school. When we were going

29:23.724 --> 29:27.650
through school, nobody took calculus until they 
got to college. Now, most all high school kids are

29:27.670 --> 29:30.834
taking calculus. So that kind of thing is 
permeating the whole system. But I think I have

29:35.902 --> 29:42.391
seen a change in the students since I've been here 
for 30 years. You probably saw a change, too. When I

29:45.085 --> 29:55.401
first came, the enrollment of A&M was about 8,000 
students, and it was largely a rural-type

29:45.085 --> 29:55.401
atmosphere. Most of the students were from rural 
or small-town environments. They had a strong

30:00.289 --> 30:01.831
work ethic. They might not have been the 
superstars in the classroom, down to the kids. We

30:07.506 --> 30:09.688
still get quite a few of those. But now we're 
probably drawing a lot more from the urban areas. I

30:12.851 --> 30:19.158
guess Harris County provides more students than 
any other place else. And so we have more students.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.062
You know, that's what Lindsey said. He called it a 
country boy school. But, you know, with respect,

30:28.107 --> 30:34.873
he said most of the kids were first-generation 
college students. And so they were That's right. I

30:37.803 --> 30:41.149
think that's been a strong deprivation. In fact, 
one of our former students, who was in one of my

30:41.169 --> 30:58.697
first classes that I taught when I was here, who is a 
well-respected manager for Dow now, was on our

30:41.169 --> 30:58.697
advisory committee for some time, and paid sure to 
conduct a survey at Dow one time, to see if there

30:59.065 --> 31:07.237
were any correlations between the grades student 
made in school and their performance on the job

30:59.065 --> 31:07.237
after they went to work. And they found that there 
was no correlation at all with grades. But he said

31:11.764 --> 31:28.148
that there was somewhat of a correlation between 
their job performance and their socioeconomic

31:11.764 --> 31:28.148
background, in that the students that came from 
the rural and small town environments tended to do

31:11.764 --> 31:28.148
better than those that came from urban 
environments. That's interesting. But there was

31:29.170 --> 31:31.674
no correlation there with grades. In fact, 
there's the old story, you know, that when you

31:31.694 --> 31:37.502
graduate, the A students will work for the C 
students. Probably because the C students had to

31:37.522 --> 31:42.028
work harder to get their grades than the A students 
did. And that work ethic meant more on the job than

31:42.048 --> 31:46.214
the actual grades. And I think that's becoming 
more important now. And the students are

31:49.619 --> 31:51.562
realizing it less. The students are putting a lot 
more emphasis on getting grades than learning.

31:57.773 --> 32:01.581
Whereas in previous years, they would put the 
emphasis on learning. And if the grade came,

32:01.621 --> 32:03.385
that's OK. But the main thing was to learn the 
material. Now the main thing is to get a grade. And

32:08.395 --> 32:10.019
if they learn something, that's OK. But the main 
thing is to get that grade. So the emphasis has

32:12.640 --> 32:15.083
changed a lot. And I guess, too, in part, that's 
because the deck's stacked that way. Yeah, that's

32:19.469 --> 32:21.632
right. The system drives it. A good C student was as 
employable as an A student. That's right. In fact,

32:29.242 --> 32:36.992
the A&M regulations now define A as excellent, B as 
good, C as satisfactory. They used to have

32:37.012 --> 32:40.757
numericals, but they don't have that anymore. But 
unfortunately, a lot of students and a lot of

32:41.159 --> 32:53.337
instructors look at C's as unsat grades because a 
student with a C average graduating has a hard time

32:41.159 --> 32:53.337
getting a job. So they look at C as basically unsat. 
And I'm afraid that we're turning some students

32:56.421 --> 33:02.290
out that are really unsat that have C averages. So, 
anyway, that's one of my soapboxes. It's way

33:07.489 --> 33:09.453
inflation. Yeah. The guy's name is without a 
shirt? Page. Page. Page. S-H-I-R-T-E-N.

33:24.916 --> 33:44.325
Oh, there's

33:24.916 --> 33:44.325
probably a few of them,

33:24.916 --> 33:44.325
I guess. come through mine, but you kind of lose 
track of them. Yeah, sure. Not many of them that I

33:48.136 --> 33:51.499
have really followed. I know this guy, and I didn't 
interview him, but David Chapman did. Jim Mathis.

33:59.769 --> 34:02.071
Jim Mathis. Yeah. I think he was before my time as 
far as being a student. He was on our direct

34:08.719 --> 34:10.701
advisor. In fact, we had another a former student 
who was on

34:12.740 --> 34:25.711
our advisory committee.

34:25.731 --> 34:30.535
But when he went through school, he always said 
that my course was the best course that he had. It's

34:30.555 --> 34:32.317
really one of the more practical courses. And 
after he graduated, he actually sent me back $275

34:32.717 --> 34:42.325
donations directly to me for support of my my 
research project. And that's the only grant that

34:44.510 --> 34:50.624
I've had that was a personal thing just for me. And 
it was right out of his pocket, sending it to me.

34:55.596 --> 34:58.002
What do you talk most of the time? Well, fluid 
mechanics, actually I taught... That's the basic

34:58.201 --> 35:02.628
fluid mechanics course? Right, junior level 
fluid mechanics. I taught that more than anyone

35:04.611 --> 35:05.993
else. That's my baby, so to speak. In fact, I just 
published my second book, which is Chemical

35:08.117 --> 35:18.353
Engineering and Fluid Mechanics, which is an 
outgrowth of teaching that course for 30 years.

35:18.451 --> 35:24.345
It's got several hundred problems in the book, 
most of which are old exam problems from previous

35:18.451 --> 35:24.345
exams. You have a lot of, I'm sure, non-chemical 
engineers, all engineers coming in. No, this is

35:30.279 --> 35:32.485
just for chemical engineers. Actually, it covers 
a lot of stuff that the other... fluid mechanics

35:35.950 --> 35:39.714
courses don't cover like in civil and mechanical. 
They have their own fluids courses. We get into not

35:41.817 --> 35:53.851
only flows and pipes and pumps and tanks and 
pressure vessels and stuff, but we also cover

35:41.817 --> 35:53.851
non-Newtonian, Newtonian, and compressible 
fluids and gases. And we also cover fluid-solid

35:54.211 --> 36:03.863
separations like falling particles and 
sedimentation and filters and fluid ion states

35:54.211 --> 36:03.863
and things like that. So it's a pretty good scope of 
material. but i've i've taught everything from

36:06.106 --> 36:34.763
freshman to

36:06.106 --> 36:34.763
graduate

36:06.106 --> 36:34.763
students well actually since i came here i've 
started probably seven or eight courses from

36:06.106 --> 36:34.763
scratch i started a graduate course in rheology 
which is my primary research area i started

36:06.106 --> 36:34.763
undergraduate courses in polymer engineering 
and corrosion and electrochemical engineering

36:35.165 --> 36:41.512
and transport phenomena. I taught and started a 
graduate course, also an undergraduate course in

36:41.733 --> 36:47.700
process safety engineering. Graduate courses in 
process safety engineering and applied

36:47.800 --> 36:57.752
electrochemistry and polymer engineering.

36:58.052 --> 37:03.298
And it's interesting, of all those courses that I 
have started, I never took a course in any of those

37:03.515 --> 37:09.361
subjects when I was in school. All of those I 
learned on my own, but the fundamental training I

37:09.381 --> 37:22.175
got in school was obviously

37:09.381 --> 37:22.175
invaluable in learning that stuff. Well, that's 
right. This is sometimes it's hard to make the

37:23.897 --> 37:27.160
students realize that You're not going to learn 
everything you need to know in your coursework.

37:30.382 --> 37:34.732
You'll just get a good background that enables you 
to learn after you get out. In fact, I saw a quote

37:35.173 --> 37:39.662
which I think was attributed to Mark Twain. I don't 
know if he originated it, but the quote is that the

37:39.722 --> 37:46.617
whole aim of education is just to enable you to 
continue learning. And I use that quite

37:46.985 --> 37:50.510
frequently with the students. How is our 
department interactive or compared to, let's

37:50.530 --> 37:58.342
say, the Texas Institute of Chemical 
Engineering? Has there been a TA going there?

37:59.604 --> 38:04.431
There really is not a lot of interchange between 
the two departments. You know, occasionally

38:04.451 --> 38:08.837
we'll have seminar speakers back and forth. But 
there's not any regular type of contact between

38:08.858 --> 38:15.287
the two departments.

38:15.307 --> 38:15.928
So they... They have had generally a better 
reputation, a higher reputation than we had in the

38:16.465 --> 38:24.437
research community. And they've had more 
financial support in that they've had a lot of

38:24.457 --> 38:37.878
professorships and chairs over there from 
donated money to their department, much more than

38:24.457 --> 38:37.878
we have. So we've been known more as the practical 
level of engineering, and they've been more of the

38:37.898 --> 38:44.768
theoretical level. Just like we're the 
conservative school and they're the liberal

38:44.950 --> 38:48.294
school. And I suspect our graduates have done as 
well over there. Oh, yeah, at least as well. And

38:56.143 --> 38:57.265
probably produced more. It's kind of ironic, 
though, because our graduates historically have

38:57.365 --> 39:10.080
been at a premium of industry, but not so well 
recruited by other graduate programs for

38:57.365 --> 39:10.080
research. So we've been known more for our 
undergraduate training than our graduate

39:10.448 --> 39:15.255
training. And of course, A&M in recent years has 
tried to reverse that trend for at least to become

39:15.275 --> 39:22.266
more renowned in research. And I think even though 
they claim otherwise, I think there has been some

39:23.127 --> 39:33.322
detrimental effects on the undergraduate 
program as a result of that heavy emphasis.

39:33.342 --> 39:35.465
Because the faculty are not dumb. They know which 
side their bread is buttered on. And if they know

39:38.450 --> 39:40.152
all the emphasis, for raises and promotions and 
whatever goes into their efforts in the graduate

39:40.503 --> 39:47.030
program, that's where they're going to spend most 
of their time. It doesn't pay to teach. That's

39:48.912 --> 39:49.413
right. And they know it, and they act that way. You 
try to get them to watch. And I've been

39:53.698 --> 40:04.830
semi-frustrated in that a lot of the things that I 
have been active in are not the things that are on

39:53.698 --> 40:04.830
the brownie point list of the administration. 
Because I spent a lot of years as an undergraduate

40:04.850 --> 40:09.295
advisor That doesn't carry a lot of weight. I have 
developed an accelerated BS master's program in

40:12.078 --> 40:20.910
the last five or six years, which has really taken 
off and become popular. This is a program that

40:20.930 --> 40:28.421
allows our better undergraduates to start 
working on a master's degree before they finish

40:20.930 --> 40:28.421
their bachelor's. But they do a project with a 
company in the industry site over two summers or

40:28.441 --> 40:38.775
equivalent, which is typically the summer before 
and after their senior year. And so I recruit the

40:39.295 --> 40:42.139
companies. I line up the projects. I recruit the 
students. I match the students and the companies

40:44.603 --> 40:46.786
up. And I supervise a lot of the students. And I try 
to get other faculty involved in supervising the

40:48.569 --> 40:55.339
students to get them out in contact with industry. 
And it's accelerated. That's not a good idea. It's

40:57.362 --> 41:04.914
accelerated because we have three Kimmy elective 
courses in the program that students take from a

40:57.362 --> 41:04.914
list of prescribed courses. And the students in 
this program can take graduate courses for these

41:08.219 --> 41:14.426
electives and get double credit for the electives 
and graduates for the master's degree. So in

41:14.446 --> 41:26.479
principle, if they were on a four-year BS track, 
they could get a master's in five years with

41:14.446 --> 41:26.479
essentially the equivalent of almost a year's 
worth of good practical industrial experience

41:14.446 --> 41:26.479
thrown in. And it's really a win-win situation for 
everybody but me and the faculty. The students in

41:34.548 --> 41:38.192
industry, I think it's great. We had a total of 
about 20 students in the program. When you first

41:46.439 --> 41:58.670
came here, tell me a little bit about Joel Powell 
and the department and how it fit in the context of

41:46.439 --> 41:58.670
engineering and engineering. Well, it's 
interesting because back then, TEAS, the

41:58.690 --> 42:08.179
Engineering Experiment Station, consisted of 
Fred Benson and Harry Whitmore. Harry was kind of

42:08.446 --> 42:12.852
the administrator for TEAS. The college got so 
much money for the experiment station, and Harry

42:13.373 --> 42:24.367
and Fred would dole that money out to the 
departments, and the departments would use it for

42:13.373 --> 42:24.367
supporting the research programs themselves. 
And that was TEAS. Now TEAS is this humongous

42:26.170 --> 42:34.521
organization with hundreds of employees and all 
their human resources and accountants and

42:26.170 --> 42:34.521
everything else. It's like night and day. the way 
it's been formalized and bureaucrat and

42:37.201 --> 42:41.868
bureaucratized. Has that helped the faculty, the 
chemical engineer? I don't think it has, really. I

42:52.564 --> 42:57.071
think the money was more effectively utilized 
back then. There wasn't as much money going out.

42:59.476 --> 43:03.173
But what there was was used more effectively. 
Because there wasn't as much use for the . Yeah, I

43:08.403 --> 43:14.390
think that's one of the things that kind of 
stimulated me to become somewhat independent of

43:08.403 --> 43:14.390
it. I was in my first research project, which we 
were known for, and it was with Joanne's

43:14.410 --> 43:23.061
population. Yeah, Victor and I were working 
together, and I think it was a $50,000 big bucks for

43:23.081 --> 43:28.388
history, you know. And we ended up with $25,000. I 
said,

43:30.450 --> 43:34.495
well, you know. So, once I decided to break, I know 
the research is on my own. It's independent. I've

43:44.025 --> 43:48.873
got a lot more research independently as a small 
business than I think I ever would have gotten

43:44.025 --> 43:48.873
before. Of course, history doesn't get that kind 
of stuff. That's right. Well, the bureaucracy can

43:51.557 --> 43:54.181
be stifling. It can be, yeah. Spend all your time 
wrestling with it. Is Holland a pretty good

43:57.126 --> 43:58.789
department? Yeah, Holland is... Well, he's very 
egotistical type of guy. I haven't interviewed

44:06.405 --> 44:07.726
him yet. I'm going to. Yeah, and I kind of always 
equated your parallels between Holland and

44:08.607 --> 44:14.433
Charlie de Gaulle. They say that any time de Gaulle 
said France, he meant de Gaulle. Any time Charlie

44:18.937 --> 44:23.822
said chemical engineering, he meant Charlie de 
Gaulle. So Charlie, he was kind of a... Sort of the

44:26.669 --> 44:30.654
benevolent dictator type of administrator. He 
had absolute control of everything. Every penny

44:34.258 --> 44:38.703
that went through the department, he had his fist 
on. But he didn't account for it as carefully as he

44:38.723 --> 44:45.390
could have, because there were years where things 
kind of fell through the cracks. Basically,

44:45.650 --> 44:54.060
though, since you've been here, I assume you've 
been doing programs, departments, faculty and

44:54.378 --> 44:56.802
students have been expanding? Oh yeah, yeah. I 
don't remember exactly how many faculty we had

44:58.445 --> 45:09.204
when I came, but I think we could probably count 
them on the fingers of both hands. But now we have,

45:09.224 --> 45:13.131
you know, 23, 4, 5 or higher. We just hired three 
more to start next year. Is that right? New

45:16.737 --> 45:17.238
addition? New position? Well, we've lost two or 
three recently, so it's a net gain of maybe one or

45:19.133 --> 45:24.258
two. Apparently, now, there wasn't a whole lot of 
turnover in your field, I guess, over the years.

45:30.303 --> 45:32.305
There was not any turnover to speak of. There was 
not? Not here, no. I just assumed there would have

45:35.588 --> 45:36.929
been. Our faculty was very stable for a long time. 
In fact, until I was here for almost 20 years, I

45:39.411 --> 45:49.140
think we'd only had maybe one or two people that had 
left that were hired. Because I guess I was

45:49.593 --> 45:59.022
thinking that the jobs and the salary scales 
outside would have been possibly so much higher

45:49.593 --> 45:59.022
that it would have lured a lot of people. That's 
true. They were, but there's not many people. You

46:02.946 --> 46:04.867
realize that when you got into the game. Yeah, 
that's right. That's why you didn't come. You

46:07.590 --> 46:08.991
didn't come here for the money. That's right. You 
weren't going to leave with the money necessarily

46:09.752 --> 46:13.375
unless you didn't like it. As long as you're 
enjoying what you're doing, you're okay with it.

46:16.627 --> 46:21.234
Our teaching loads, I remember one semester I 
think I was teaching five sections. Now one of

46:21.294 --> 46:25.019
those was in the graduate extension. We used to 
teach our graduate courses at various industrial

46:25.039 --> 46:29.426
sites around the state. So that was considered an 
overload, an extra load in addition to our

46:30.247 --> 46:36.175
original graduate course load. So I remember one 
semester I was teaching five. classes on campus

46:39.053 --> 46:42.882
and one class off campus. And this was like four 
different courses, I think, three or four

46:42.902 --> 46:50.641
different courses. I think we were 15 hours in the 
first thing. I know I was.
