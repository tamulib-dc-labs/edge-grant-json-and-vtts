WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:15.713
We say that my experiences, even though I thought 
it was very, very tough coming from where I came

00:02.630 --> 00:15.713
from, was not as bad as a lot of the other guys had it. 
And I think across the board, we had a lot of people

00:15.753 --> 00:25.790
that flunked out just due to the fact that they 
didn't have time to study or that emphasis. I think

00:28.735 --> 00:34.622
I think that back on that, I was fortunate enough to 
be class agent 10 years from my class. And I've

00:35.423 --> 00:41.470
talked to Z and the guys, had many, many different 
reunions and many reunions I was involved in. And

00:41.490 --> 00:49.459
hearing all their war stories, they're either 
telling a pretty high, wild type of freshman year.

00:50.240 --> 00:53.543
But I think they probably did experience a lot more 
than I did. Describe a typical class day. You got up

00:57.929 --> 00:59.050
at what time? Well, the whistle jock would come in. 
We could say 630, 6 to 630,

01:00.833 --> 01:07.802
depending on what was happening. We did not do like 
the Corps does now, get up in the morning and run.

01:11.606 --> 01:12.628
There was none of this running. I think the only 
running I ever did was intramurals. I ran cross

01:15.551 --> 01:17.874
country for our outfit. But we would get up, and the 
whistle jock, of course, would blow three times,

01:17.894 --> 01:27.767
the third time being fallout, usually at 20 
minutes tail, Maybe it was 10, 5, and then fallout.

01:31.869 --> 01:35.054
I'm not sure whether it was 20 or 10 minute, the 
first warning. But anyway, we would fall out, and

01:35.134 --> 01:41.625
then we would be outside. We'd stand formation, 
and the sophomores would check us over, and the

01:41.705 --> 01:47.595
juniors would be then taking the formation, and 
then the seniors would come out of the dorm a little

01:48.250 --> 01:52.496
bit later. Lots of times we'd be marching back and 
forth, but when the juniors took over, the first

01:52.937 --> 02:11.923
sergeant usually would at that time give us some 
type of instruction, and that's something in the

01:52.937 --> 02:11.923
17 years that I worked in the commandant's office 
is something I always felt that was very

01:52.937 --> 02:11.923
important, but it had gone away, you know. It was a 
good time for One of the biggest problems, I think,

02:15.098 --> 02:18.744
in the Corps was lack of communications. And even 
then, but even to this day. Now, you had classes

02:24.334 --> 02:26.919
beginning at 8? 8 o'clock. And I remember we would 
march to formation. But that year, I was in dorm

02:33.831 --> 02:38.018
two, so we ate in Duncan. Again, we would have the 
typical old days of you'd have a hot corner, a

02:38.690 --> 02:45.181
freshman be on hot corner. We'd usually have two 
sophomores on the table and a junior. In our case,

02:48.646 --> 02:58.021
since we had so many freshmen, we might have a 
senior which would turn, but we only had three

02:48.646 --> 02:58.021
seniors in our outfit. When you figure you had 
70-something freshmen and only three seniors,

02:58.082 --> 03:02.529
that's unbelievable. And all three of them were in 
vet school, so... One of them was married, so we

03:05.487 --> 03:11.656
only had two in the dorm, so it was different than 
the other units. Colonel Scott was our TAC

03:12.517 --> 03:18.626
officer, referred to as the Goose. And I've had a 
lot of experience with him. And I asked him one time

03:21.690 --> 03:29.942
about, he was teaching math at Snook, and I asked 
him to talk at our reunion. When he come to our mini

03:31.424 --> 03:40.939
reunion, this was right before he passed away, and 
it put me on a real guilt trip because he said, are

03:31.424 --> 03:40.939
they going to throw those darn biscuits at me 
again? Which was kind of customary. Once or twice a

03:44.225 --> 03:54.040
year on the third Wildcat, everybody would chunk, 
as we would say, a deal or a roll at the duty officer

03:54.627 --> 04:00.874
or the bull, the military officer, usually a 
reservist, sitting over at this little table with

03:54.627 --> 04:00.874
the OD. the cadet officer of the day, who just 
happened to disappear at that time for some

04:01.175 --> 04:05.319
reason. Who gave the signal to actually do that? 
How did y'all, how was that organized? It was

04:12.465 --> 04:15.868
usually done without Corps staff knowing about 
it. Would y'all have planned it? Oh, we would.

04:19.811 --> 04:29.680
Somehow the word would have gotten around, today 
we're going to do it, and in the mess hall the word

04:19.811 --> 04:29.680
kind of got around to everybody on the third 
Wildcat deal, and it just somebody started it and

04:29.660 --> 04:51.921
then of course uh a corps commander whoever was 
involved would uh or in charge that day would have

04:29.660 --> 04:51.921
to go see now could the biscuit or the the bread have 
anything on it or in it uh i'm from all the reports

04:29.660 --> 04:51.921
i've heard some of them did but again i don't uh 
remember. And that didn't happen but maybe once a

04:52.918 --> 04:55.082
year. And then, of course, you pay the price. 
Something's going to happen, you know. What

04:58.527 --> 05:00.069
normally did happen? Well, you know, you would, 
our, we might end up having an extra drill or we'd

05:00.089 --> 05:08.302
have inspections. And that was one of the problems 
about the A&M that first year. We drilled on

05:14.031 --> 05:15.293
Saturday. which means if you were an Army unit, we 
had an armory downstairs, or really what it was was

05:15.897 --> 05:24.846
a dormitory room with bars on it and extra locks on 
the door. And you would draw or get issued your

05:25.547 --> 05:37.459
weapon, which in that case we had M1 rifles on 
Friday night, and then you would have to clean them

05:25.547 --> 05:37.459
and everything, and then your room would have to be 
ready for inspection. And so I can always remember

05:37.499 --> 05:42.664
in our dorm, Friday afternoon, at 4.30 was usually 
the time to wax the halls, and that was freshman

05:43.066 --> 06:05.867
privilege, and so we would wax all, but Saturday 
we'd have the drill, and then we'd have to check our

05:43.066 --> 06:05.867
weapons back in, and well, it was always some 
junior that was called the armorer that would be

05:43.066 --> 06:05.867
responsible for taking them in, and then you'd 
have to No matter what you did, it had too much oil or

06:06.725 --> 06:09.394
not enough oil. And they could always find a junior 
that didn't have a car and wasn't going like

06:09.474 --> 06:15.233
Houston for the weekend or something. Right now, 
on this class day, you had classes almost all

06:15.854 --> 06:22.102
morning. All morning, and then back, we'd have 
formation at noon, we'd march the meals, we'd come

06:22.202 --> 06:39.765
back, and then that evening, formation, where 
we'd fall out for our retreat to take the flag down,

06:22.202 --> 06:39.765
and then again march, so we marched three meals. 
During that time, though, probably most

06:40.646 --> 06:43.650
important time for most of the units because your 
number one award was the General Moore. And

06:48.014 --> 06:50.046
everybody thought they were going to win it 
towards the end of the year, because everybody

06:50.448 --> 06:55.613
seemed like the upperclassmen kept you pumped up. 
Intramural points participation was also

06:56.333 --> 07:00.937
something that was very, very important. And so we 
would get out and we would practice, whether it was

07:02.178 --> 07:09.745
in the fall, flag football, later basketball. We 
had tennis. Ping pong counted just as much as

07:12.667 --> 07:16.371
football did. So intramurals was a very, very big 
part. And I remember that was of course something

07:20.114 --> 07:24.708
that was, sports was very important to me. What 
happened in intramurals to that awkward kid who

07:24.728 --> 07:30.184
just wasn't very well coordinated? Lots of times 
it, It was basically terrible and sinful, because

07:34.795 --> 07:44.615
the upperclassmen would take the people that were 
actually the better athletes. And those were ones

07:45.657 --> 07:50.506
in particular, because winning was much more 
important than participation. So what it meant,

07:50.526 --> 07:56.398
it was kind of like the old days when you were 
playing out on the yard. and you drew sticks or you

07:56.378 --> 08:02.924
flipped a coin or whatever to who goes first, and 
then I'll take you, you, you. And usually that kid

08:03.344 --> 08:06.367
that's last is the kid that's last every time. In 
this case, they would not be out there

08:06.787 --> 08:12.533
participating unless they were just really 
gung-ho. And so you usually came up with teams.

08:19.279 --> 08:26.385
But intramurals was probably the one thing that 
kept me at Texas A&M. I remember my sophomore year,

08:26.922 --> 08:31.748
I became the athletic corporal and in junior year, 
the athletic sergeant. And one little war story.

08:37.176 --> 08:56.001
Richard Adams, who you know from Missouri, who is 
the dean of vet school, was on the elevator one day

08:37.176 --> 08:56.001
when I had been up having lunch with Mrs. Rutter 
coming down because she's a very close family

08:37.176 --> 08:56.001
friend with Sally's family and lived next to each 
other. That's another story, but

08:56.504 --> 09:09.507
Richard had just been upstairs and it had been 
approved that he would be the dean of the vet

08:56.504 --> 09:09.507
school, and he was a freshman in my outfit when I was 
a junior. And one of the first things he talked to me

09:10.269 --> 09:19.525
about was, did I know the year I left, and it took me 
five years to graduate, but did I know the year i

09:19.910 --> 09:48.246
left that they won class a football championship 
now here is a gentleman a very distinguished

09:19.910 --> 09:48.246
professor but when he saw me he identified with 
intramurals and it was very very important to him

09:19.910 --> 09:48.246
and so we had a lot of fun a little humor you asked for 
some humor uh he told me the uh another uh another uh

09:19.910 --> 09:48.246
underclassman who i was with the entire times mike 
tatum who's also a professor out in the vet school

09:48.783 --> 10:10.318
and he was a year behind me where Richard was two 
years and and Richard said when he became the dean

09:48.783 --> 10:10.318
he had walked the halls out there during the day 
trying to find Tatum so he could get even with him

09:48.783 --> 10:10.318
you know he wanted to have him do something now that 
he was in charge but but intramurals to answer your

09:48.783 --> 10:10.318
question during the day was very, very important. 
And lots of times we could miss evening formation

10:12.752 --> 10:21.922
and fall out late if we were participating, which 
meant we didn't have to before. And maybe we'd have

10:22.523 --> 10:31.893
to go to sophomores holes, as they call it, and 
catch all kinds of hell for 30 minutes about our

10:22.523 --> 10:31.893
brass, not being there 15 minutes before we went 
outside and stood. So if you participate in

10:31.913 --> 10:34.956
intramurals, you really got out of that. Now, 
normally during the weekdays, about how much time

10:35.662 --> 10:42.550
did you have unscheduled? if you were taking of 
course 17 hours you would you would probably find

10:44.183 --> 11:10.360
that you were in class let's just say you might have 
two to three hours because most people took 17 or 18

10:44.183 --> 11:10.360
hours you'd have two to three hours at the max that 
you would have available during the day because

10:44.183 --> 11:10.360
again it gets back to what you've taken i was taking 
three courses that had labs so i was basically

11:10.340 --> 11:32.702
involved somehow class all the time and then if you 
come back to the room the one problem our outfit did

11:10.340 --> 11:32.702
have was sophomores could come in your room and if 
you're there all of a sudden we got to make this

11:10.340 --> 11:32.702
spirit sign to hang up for the football game or we 
got to do this or that so academics was not stressed

11:10.340 --> 11:32.702
like I think It is today. Where did you and your 
closest buddies spend any non-scheduled time

11:34.512 --> 11:41.455
during the day? I could have gone to the library, 
but I didn't. I think I worried more. more about

11:46.874 --> 11:49.937
going all the way over to Northgate for cleaning. 
And I lived in Durham, too, or I was going to get

11:49.997 --> 11:56.864
something or just you don't know where the time 
went. I know I did not take advantage of the library

11:56.924 --> 12:00.788
time. I do know that my major problem was, as I 
mentioned before, that I had no idea how to study,

12:00.848 --> 12:08.737
period. And I could sit there for the three-hour CQ 
at night and procrastinate the whole time of, I

12:13.081 --> 12:21.676
don't know what I did, but I didn't know how to use my 
time wisely. And then sometimes during the day it

12:22.577 --> 12:30.010
would be a panic to get that paper done or whatever, 
you know.

12:31.407 --> 12:51.103
dining hall routine at your in your outfit was a 
little less stringent than in some of the others i i

12:31.407 --> 12:51.103
didn't think so at the time you know i thought 
really uh even up until when i graduated we had

12:31.407 --> 12:51.103
about as tough as everybody else but i have learned 
over the years being associated with a m i was

12:31.407 --> 12:51.103
fortunate to come back and teach ROTC 70, 74, and 
nearly two years worked as assistant commandant

12:51.083 --> 12:58.253
for Colonel Parsons. And you would visit with a lot 
more of your classmates then, and then I retired

12:59.094 --> 13:12.653
from the Army in 84 and came back, and then I was 
class agent 10 years, so I was deeply involved.

13:12.937 --> 13:24.312
with what goes on at all reunions when people get 
back together and tell war stories of what they

13:12.937 --> 13:24.312
did, you start picking up a pattern that, yeah, a 
lot of these things happen to a lot of people, you

13:12.937 --> 13:24.312
know. Did you all have cush questions? Oh, yes, 
yes. What were some cush questions? I remember one

13:31.542 --> 13:40.935
little story of which, and a cush question, of 
course, being for dessert, and if you didn't

13:31.542 --> 13:40.935
answer it, you didn't get dessert. But that wasn't 
the bad, it was the, I think what bothered you was

13:42.772 --> 13:49.945
the challenge from those sophomores getting to 
you and getting over on you. And I remember being

13:50.686 --> 14:02.468
asked a question one time, which class had the 
stone in their ring? And I tried to find that

14:02.887 --> 14:05.810
answer. And I finally, as I mentioned, this was the 
first semester, and I had already lost a lot of

14:06.391 --> 14:13.479
weight. And I put more emphasis on this than I did 
trying to learn maybe the table of the chemistry.

14:21.668 --> 14:25.011
But I went over. Finally, somebody sent me to Mr. 
Gay in the YMCA. I went in and told Mr. Gay I have this

14:31.018 --> 14:32.860
problem. And it's really bothering me. And so he 
just picks up the phone, dials down the hall. He

14:39.783 --> 14:44.569
wants to talk to Earl Rutter, who was the vice 
president, come in to be vice president that year.

14:44.609 --> 14:49.816
And all I could think was, oh, my God, those 
pissheads are going to kill me, General Rutter,

14:44.609 --> 14:49.816
you know. And all Mr. Gay asked him was that 
question, which class. He could not remember,

14:53.721 --> 14:55.884
didn't know. And he said, well, call Lupo. Well, 
Mr. Gay then called Mr. Lou, and Mr. Lou said class

14:59.869 --> 15:02.813
30. which if you check the course center or you 
check downstairs here in the former students,

15:03.215 --> 15:10.001
you'll see a class of 30 with a stone. I found out 
later little trivia about that that the the class

15:13.272 --> 15:36.951
of 30 had the option and some of them got the stone 
and some of them got the regular Aggie ring for that

15:13.272 --> 15:36.951
year caused a big big friction with their class and 
that was the last year that that they did it I

15:13.272 --> 15:36.951
remember one time and I again, being associated 
with A&M and wearing a uniform for so long as I did up

15:37.454 --> 15:46.142
until 97 when I came over to the former students, 
you would meet a lot of people. And a lot of these

15:46.322 --> 15:50.266
people were very distinguished former students. 
But when they came back to your environment of the

15:50.366 --> 15:57.293
military, they wanted to live their military days 
again and talk about their experiences. And I can

15:57.353 --> 16:00.556
remember Mr. Hal Booty here one time. And we got to 
talking about that ring. He got out the yearbook,

16:06.260 --> 16:23.482
which the 1930 yearbook is the most outstanding 
yearbook probably ever done because they were so

16:06.260 --> 16:23.482
far ahead, or he was so far ahead of his times with 
landing crafts out on the Pacific and

16:06.260 --> 16:23.482
aviation-type units or aircraft that just go on 
and on and on. Even the cover where the one year from

16:23.522 --> 16:29.770
1930, they had a covered wagon on the cover and That 
year they had a city, and it was skyscrapers with

16:30.104 --> 16:41.279
lights on one side, and you'd go over to, I mean, the 
daytime on the other side, it would be at night, but

16:30.104 --> 16:41.279
you're familiar with that, I can tell. But

16:41.920 --> 16:57.040
once we opened the Court Center, and I had talked to 
Randy Mattson about the possibility of us having

16:41.920 --> 16:57.040
another ring case over there, and he and Mr. 
Williford was the president at that time, agreed

16:57.357 --> 16:59.765
to that. And I got the Mothers Club from Houston to 
fund the case. little sidelight on that we have a

17:05.710 --> 17:32.292
beautiful quilt there that the dallas mothers 
club did on traditions and it is just just really

17:05.710 --> 17:32.292
tremendous of the different traditions that 
patterns sewn in and and my sister did the army rotc

17:05.710 --> 17:32.292
one because her son was down here as a freshman that 
year but the houston mothers club jumped me out one

17:05.710 --> 17:32.292
time because i had a plaque there It said the Dallas 
A&M Mothers Club, and they didn't have anything in

17:32.272 --> 17:35.577
the core center. So the next thing I did was talk to 
the Houston Mothers Club and said, okay, we can

17:35.657 --> 17:45.813
have this ring case, and for $6,000 we can put your 
name on it. They jumped on it, and where I'm leading

17:45.953 --> 17:59.173
up to now is one day we have a ring that comes in 
that's got a stone in it that says 1929. which

17:59.693 --> 18:02.858
nothing tracked on this. And found out that we 
checked to see that the gentleman that came in was a

18:02.878 --> 18:11.672
transfer student or referred to as a frog. And he 
laid out a semester. So he graduated with 30, but he

18:14.857 --> 18:18.603
was actually class 29. So when he ordered his ring, 
instead of 30, they put the 29 on. And that's also

18:22.529 --> 18:27.557
over in the core center.

18:28.853 --> 18:34.603
I guess I've gotten off the subject a little bit 
from your question, but back to the Cush question.

18:34.623 --> 18:35.825
Were there some that had no answer? Oh, yes. Well, I 
went back that night with the answer, Fish

18:36.786 --> 18:41.594
Henderson.

18:43.517 --> 18:43.898
Yes, sir. What class had the stone in their ring? 
Mr. whoever it was, Fish Henderson requested

18:48.918 --> 18:52.342
permission to make a statement, sir. I said yes and 
said, the class of 1930, sir. And to this day, I can

18:59.691 --> 19:01.973
remember his reply. That is correct, Fish 
Henderson. Now for the second half of your

19:04.376 --> 19:06.439
question. So yes, I didn't eat many calories that 
year, but it was not Whether you got the question or

19:15.023 --> 19:20.610
not, or right, or the cush or anything, it became a 
little mind game with the upper class. You didn't

19:20.651 --> 19:22.072
want them to get over on you. You wanted to be a sharp 
freshman. Sure, you had to memorize certain

19:23.895 --> 19:26.819
things. I can tell you today, Alison Crooks Yates, 
first 13th last names on the Westgate Memorial,

19:26.859 --> 19:35.410
you know, and recognition, funded 
participation, agricultural, mechanical.

19:35.831 --> 19:38.955
Those kind of things I remember. the monuments, 
you know. I'm still probably the keeper of

19:41.396 --> 19:46.564
monuments or things dealing with the military. 
Anybody has a question, they seem to come to me

19:46.604 --> 19:50.489
instead of archives. But the point is, questions 
we had, some of them were fair, some of them came out

19:50.549 --> 19:59.262
of Lupo's little book. Since the standard now 
lists the questions you're supposed to know,

19:59.282 --> 20:08.976
because we were required to know all of the 
athletes, their hometown, you know, supposed to

19:59.282 --> 20:08.976
know what they're majoring in. And then we had the 
unwritten rule of court trips, you go to the game.

20:15.252 --> 20:15.512
Period. You better go to the game. Lord help you if 
you got back and you couldn't answer Monday

20:17.074 --> 20:26.406
morning which end of the stadium the Aggies came 
out of. Did you and your buddies do any tricks, play

20:26.506 --> 20:32.854
any games at the dining hall table? Only, the best I 
can remember, we only did them when directed by

20:35.146 --> 20:41.333
another upperclassman. And a junior might have us 
do something to a junior. And the way it would

20:44.877 --> 20:49.382
normally happen is the seniors would leave the 
dining hall first. And then the juniors would

20:50.183 --> 20:51.464
leave. The sophomores, you might have a horse's 
tail that'd stay around, a rashy, you know. But

20:58.703 --> 21:07.998
most of the time, the games were played, you were 
directed, just like in the dorm, directed to play

20:58.703 --> 21:07.998
them against another upper class. So that y'all 
very seldom used to... No, we didn't do any

21:08.018 --> 21:16.512
pull-outs there in the mess halls because you paid 
the price if you did, you know. In hindsight, how

21:17.473 --> 21:22.922
would you describe the quality of dining hall food 
at A&M in your undergraduate years? Well, I

21:23.189 --> 21:25.112
remember the cold cuts on Sunday. I can remember 
that very well. You know, Sunday night was a junior

21:27.095 --> 21:35.266
privilege to yell anything on the campus, you 
know. And I can remember the cold cuts on Sunday

21:35.426 --> 21:43.037
night, and I can remember somebody yelling out the 
window about, eight or nine o'clock and you could

21:43.827 --> 21:57.128
hear it all down the quad i hate this blankety blank 
place you know somebody just come back now most of

21:43.827 --> 21:57.128
my friends uh people i associate we hung around 
here on the weekends didn't go anywhere And we'd go

21:57.462 --> 22:04.074
to DeWare Field House and usually play basketball 
or something at Saturday night, 2, 3 in the

21:57.462 --> 22:04.074
morning. And I've set this tone that, thank 
goodness, both of my kids have done extremely well

22:04.114 --> 22:10.946
academically. I'll give my wife credit for that. 
But I was, again, involved. If I had any free time,

22:17.257 --> 22:19.739
it was usually dealing with sports. But did you not 
think the food was good? I thought the food was

22:22.602 --> 22:23.803
excellent. I mean, I really did. Pardon me, except 
the cold cuts on Sunday night. I thought one of the

22:27.666 --> 22:34.492
things I liked about it, though, was after the 
sophomores left, you could millhound. You could

22:34.512 --> 22:36.834
go around and take anything off any of the tables. 
And if there was something you really liked, you'd

22:36.874 --> 22:39.797
just go get it. Because we ate family style. You'd 
pick up the bowl. And that was a freshman

22:42.739 --> 22:46.082
privilege, to stay and eat. Unless you really had a 
problem, and the only problem we had was during

22:46.670 --> 22:53.240
football season when we'd have a yell practice in 
the Grove. And after the second announcement, we

22:54.102 --> 23:06.281
all had to yell like hell and scream, hold your 
hands over your head and run out of there and run all

22:54.102 --> 23:06.281
the way to the Grove, you know, for yell practice so 
you could get chewed out and stand in detention

22:54.102 --> 23:06.281
some more. But I always looked at it, everybody 
else having to do it. Did you have a favorite main

23:10.808 --> 23:14.314
course or a favorite dessert? Well, most of the 
time you didn't have dessert. You know, you just,

23:16.971 --> 23:21.038
now we did, you could get dessert. We had 
competition on march-ins. Once a week or so they

23:25.025 --> 23:36.444
would, or maybe once every two weeks, we'd have 
judges or graders, as they're referred to then,

23:25.025 --> 23:36.444
and pick the outstanding outfits. So we might vote 
I mean, so we might bet with the medical company

23:39.168 --> 23:49.480
upstairs that we're going to do higher than they 
do, and then if we did, we got double cush, we'd get

23:39.168 --> 23:49.480
their cush, and then usually freshmen could have a 
cush. We also had the inspections and formation,

23:49.500 --> 24:02.936
and the sharpest guy, if you were ever the sharpest 
guy, you might get a bag in or some kind of extra

23:49.500 --> 24:02.936
privilege, and your entire squad would get it. And 
so I remember one time when... We had a guy named

24:07.197 --> 24:21.397
Gerald Sullivan from Galveston, and we were going 
to, he was small, slender, and so we lived on the

24:07.197 --> 24:21.397
fourth floor, and his uniform was starched just 
like a razor blade. Mike Shively was the best at fit

24:22.218 --> 24:24.662
shining shoes. He shined his shoes. Johnny 
Sullivan and I and our squad, we helped him down the

24:27.386 --> 24:33.154
stairs so he never did break that crease. And we had 
him out there, and we worked hard on this. This was

24:36.787 --> 24:37.608
important. This was a big deal. And that night, our 
squad won the privilege. But we still laugh at this

24:44.057 --> 24:50.727
today because Robert Davidson didn't win, but 
Johnny Sullivan, his hometown buddy from

24:44.057 --> 24:50.727
Galveston, won. And we lost a little faith in the 
system after that. uh let's see uh jokes pranks

24:57.620 --> 25:26.833
good bull yeah there's a lot of a lot of that went on 
of course uh a lot of uh things we do the drowned outs

24:57.620 --> 25:26.833
and and i know that a lot of people probably told you 
about the drowned outs you know a real uh probably

24:57.620 --> 25:26.833
the start of my military experience would be uh uh 
the dorm across the way if uh if uh you were going to

24:57.620 --> 25:26.833
uh uh float it out as we'd say uh on top of the toilets 
of course the little piece of metal we referred to

25:27.387 --> 25:41.650
as the head you could take that off but but you had to 
be in sync with whoever got in the steam tunnels and

25:27.387 --> 25:41.650
cut the water off so we would say at two o'clock in 
the morning Nothing ever went at 2 o'clock in the

25:42.237 --> 25:44.660
morning. It'd be 2.07. You'd cut the water off in 
the steam tunnels. The six cadets or eight or

25:49.746 --> 26:00.359
whatever was up there with their pipe wrenches 
with a hand towel of some sort so you didn't make any

25:49.746 --> 26:00.359
noise at all. You'd take those heads off, and you'd 
have six, seven minutes to get out of the dorm. And

26:06.487 --> 26:11.673
it would normally be the fourth floor because 
water would go down four stories. And then the

26:12.654 --> 26:23.906
freshmen would be out of there, out of the dorm, 
because if, number one, if they came out and the

26:12.654 --> 26:23.906
water started, then it made it a little easier to 
track. And so then you'd, of course, try to be back

26:25.447 --> 26:32.815
in your dorm sound asleep when the bulls or the or 
the cadet officer of the day, or whoever. And

26:37.175 --> 26:40.164
usually somebody would have seen a freshman 
running in a dorm. You never could win. It was one of

26:43.240 --> 26:46.404
those games that was played. Most of the time, 
though, you're doing anything was because some

26:48.507 --> 26:54.095
upperclassmen had something coming. And the old 
M-80s or cherry bombs wrapped in a Babbo can.

27:00.263 --> 27:07.493
Another little military move, of course, would 
be, and I know you've heard this a zillion times,

27:00.263 --> 27:07.493
but is to one freshman would open the door. Another 
one would pitch the, would light the firecracker,

27:07.473 --> 27:17.486
a babbo wrapped up with the M-80 fuse sticking out 
and pitch it in there. And then the next one,

27:17.526 --> 27:21.532
because you had that delay, the next one would take 
a trash can. Of course, I always had different

27:22.353 --> 27:24.316
names for everything. And then you'd pitch the 
water on the one or two guys in the bunk. and then and

27:28.718 --> 27:58.337
then you'd pull the door to in the end of a coke case 
you'd put that stick on the door and you'd slide her

27:28.718 --> 27:58.337
down where there's no way that door is going to open 
back in and you'd be long gone and but for some

27:28.718 --> 27:58.337
reason they could usually figure out who did it if 
you didn't if they didn't all the freshmen are

27:28.718 --> 27:58.337
going to stay up shining floors doing something 
but i will tell you that upperclassman's room was

27:28.718 --> 27:58.337
very very clean but when the sun came up you know But 
there were lots of pranks. I remember we had one guy

28:01.996 --> 28:22.620
who was a wildlife major and he had the bird nest out 
there on his balcony and it's amazing how you could

28:01.996 --> 28:22.620
let another freshman in the middle of the night 
from the window up above put ropes on them and Put

28:22.904 --> 28:27.488
them down there and you can imagine what ended up in 
his little bird house there. Just little

28:27.569 --> 28:30.062
off-the-wall things like that, you know. But 
nothing what I'd call criminal or really. Where

28:34.905 --> 28:40.670
was the entry place for the steam tunnels over in 
the Dunkin' Dining Hall area? I don't know about

28:41.051 --> 28:42.332
the Dunkin' Dining. Oh, but in our dorms, as you 
came in the two dorms in the middle of the dorm, the

28:42.372 --> 28:56.825
two doors, excuse me, right there, there was a door 
going down just like stairs going down into the

28:42.372 --> 28:56.825
basement. In every dorm? Mm-hmm. Oh. Yeah. And 
same thing over in the

28:59.236 --> 29:05.682
old area where I lived the last three years. And 
steam tunnels, it is sad because so many kids have

29:06.422 --> 29:15.030
gotten in trouble today over going down there. And 
now the police have every kind of warning device.

29:17.452 --> 29:19.594
And when you come out, you're going downtown. This 
is an offense. All right. In your student days,

29:22.917 --> 29:29.083
let's make believe that you go down the steam 
tunnel in the Duncan area. Mm-hmm. How far under

29:29.223 --> 29:34.870
the campus could you or anybody else who knew the 
routine travel? I can remember just going all

29:35.030 --> 29:39.115
through the area. You could get up to Duncan and 
there'd be bars on there with a padlock, the bars

29:39.155 --> 29:49.628
being on some type of gate that would swing open. So 
they had areas going into certain places blocked

29:49.608 --> 29:58.781
off, but you could actually go into steam tunnels 
and get over to other dorms as well as. But if you

29:59.923 --> 30:08.815
were doing a float out or something, you know, most 
of those guys that's going to turn that water on,

30:09.267 --> 30:16.416
They're going to, they could go that route, but 
most of the time you're probably going to come back

30:09.267 --> 30:16.416
up those stairs and go out that way. But could you 
have gone? All over the campus. Really? But now

30:21.523 --> 30:30.535
there is, and I haven't been down there, but I've 
read a couple of articles about the graffiti and

30:21.523 --> 30:30.535
everything that came along later. I don't 
remember the graffiti, even though I spent a

30:30.575 --> 30:35.281
little bit of time in them. What did... people in 
your day used to light their way a cigarette

30:38.005 --> 30:42.512
lighter? Flashlights. We had flashlights. Oh, 
I'm sorry. Okay. And describe the dimensions of

30:48.601 --> 30:51.665
the steam tower. They were not very big. I mean, 
there were some places, of course, you could stand

30:54.029 --> 31:02.942
up and walk, but there's other places that was 
pretty tight, and then pipes running through

30:54.029 --> 31:02.942
there. How wide? You know, it's amazing how 
everything was bigger back then in your memory,

31:04.837 --> 31:14.680
but it seems like it was about four feet wide is 
about what I remember. Do you remember, and you

31:15.341 --> 31:19.892
were talking about good bull and pranks, do you 
remember any in class?
