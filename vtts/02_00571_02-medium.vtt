WEBVTT

00:07.304 --> 00:12.491
Well I was very pleased when everything checked 
out and got in the maneuvering unit. It checked out

00:12.732 --> 00:16.878
and I was able to go ahead and start flying it 
around. Was it fun? Yeah it was fun. Your newspaper

00:19.922 --> 00:26.471
article said that you had a great deal of fun with it 
and that your wife Bernadette said that you didn't

00:19.922 --> 00:26.471
want to come in again. Well it flew very much like 
the simulator so that I was able to relax and enjoy

00:35.536 --> 00:39.322
flying the thing. It was a pleasure to be in an 
environment where there were no artificial

00:40.905 --> 00:51.762
limits to the number of degrees of roll, pitch, or 
yaw you could go through. You didn't have to worry

00:51.782 --> 00:57.892
about encumbering cables or umbilicals or things 
of that sort. Basically, it was just a matter of

00:59.274 --> 01:03.180
getting on with the planned profile out the system 
and making sure that indeed it flew as it appeared

01:04.240 --> 01:11.611
to. When was the project for the MMU first brought 
to your attention? Well, actually, the

01:15.156 --> 01:33.522
Air Force built a maneuvering unit known as the 
Astronaut Maneuvering Unit, which was carried on

01:15.156 --> 01:33.522
Gemini 9, which flew in June of 1967. if I recall 
correctly. And one of the, or the fatal, if I can

01:36.062 --> 01:53.782
call it that, problem there was that the 
pressure-shoot technology was in such an infant

01:36.062 --> 01:53.782
state that Gene Cernan, who was to fly it, became 
exhausted and overheated and things of that sort

01:36.062 --> 01:53.782
before he could do so. There were some problems 
with that unit as well, but it had been scheduled to

01:55.044 --> 02:03.694
fly again on Gemini 12 and was taken off because our 
confidence in EVA technology was on sort of a

02:04.332 --> 02:10.399
roller coaster cycle. That is, Gemini 9 had 
problems. 10 went well. 11 had problems. They

02:15.786 --> 02:19.471
figured that they would finish up the Gemini 
program on a positive note. So they made the

02:19.491 --> 02:23.856
spacewalk on Gemini 12 a very simple one. So 
maneuvering units were in low regard, I guess you

02:25.418 --> 02:32.787
could say. at that time. An Air Force captain by the 
name of Ed Whitsitt had an idea for an experiment

02:34.278 --> 02:47.189
inside the Skylab workshop, which was then being 
talked about as Apollo Applications AAP. And I got

02:47.229 --> 02:48.490
together with him. And over the course of a few 
years, we put together an experiment, which came

02:48.550 --> 03:03.162
to be known as M509, or the Astronaut Maneuvering 
Research Vehicle, which was an experimental

02:48.550 --> 03:03.162
maneuvering unit. that was in fact carried inside 
the Skylab workshop and flown inside the workshop

03:03.817 --> 03:19.636
in a pressurized environment so that you got the 
zero-gravity maneuvering dynamics, but it

03:03.817 --> 03:19.636
didn't have to be qualified for vacuum or for the 
thermal extremes of space or for the reliability.

03:21.639 --> 03:30.229
Five Skylab crewmen flew it for a total of about 14 
flying hours, and we took the data from that

03:30.766 --> 03:41.502
experiment and the in-flight films and TV footage 
and used them to sell the MMU for the shuttle

03:30.766 --> 03:41.502
program. So I guess you could say the whole thing 
stretched from about the fall of 1967 on up to the

03:41.522 --> 03:51.036
spring of 1984.

03:53.395 --> 03:57.680
The MMU is viewed as a technological breakthrough 
in space travel. Are there plans underway for a

03:58.901 --> 04:02.926
larger space vehicle based on the same propulsion 
system? Well, we'd like to roughly double the

04:03.967 --> 04:13.177
propellant supply in the MMU to shift it over to a 
microprocessor-based control system.

04:15.960 --> 04:19.544
Those are about the only things that we see on the 
immediate horizon. Now, there have been some

04:22.049 --> 04:36.946
concepts around for a number of years for

04:22.049 --> 04:36.946
something they call a personnel transporter, 
which would be the orbital analog of a motor

04:22.049 --> 04:36.946
scooter. You could climb aboard the thing, and it 
would probably look a lot like a stand-up motor

04:37.807 --> 04:48.900
scooter, but with a larger platform out behind it, 
so you could carry two and maybe three There's

04:49.792 --> 05:17.790
also been a proposal known as the Man Remote 
Workstation, which is a little enclosed capsule

04:49.792 --> 05:17.790
with manipulator arms sticking out the front of 
propulsion jets and things like that on it. very

05:18.833 --> 05:31.126
similar to the

05:18.833 --> 05:31.126
little capsule in 2001 in Space Odyssey. But 
again, that hasn't gotten beyond the artist

05:31.586 --> 05:34.890
concept stage. But one of the things that's being 
done with the space station program is to put about

05:35.631 --> 05:47.203
10% of our development funding, at least 
initially, into looking at automation and

05:47.892 --> 05:53.903
robotics and what that could do for the system, it 
may be that something like this would fall out of

05:47.892 --> 05:53.903
it.

06:03.485 --> 06:18.102
How

06:03.485 --> 06:18.102
did you go about testing it in preparation for the 
flight, and did you use a simulator as you earlier

06:03.485 --> 06:18.102
said, and how fast were you traveling when you were 
using MMU in space? Okay, let's take the questions

06:19.864 --> 06:23.328
one at a time. Okay. As far as the speed in space, 
both I And the orbiter were moving along at about

06:29.860 --> 06:40.741
17,000 miles an hour, which is the orbital 
velocity at our altitude of about 150 nautical

06:29.860 --> 06:40.741
miles. The relative speed between myself and the 
MMU and the orbiter was never more than about 1.5 to

06:41.362 --> 06:52.003
2 feet per second. The idea is basically you're 
maneuvering with respect to the orbiter much as

06:53.452 --> 07:02.641
you fly formation between two airplanes. Small, 
deliberate movements or control inputs, and you

07:02.661 --> 07:11.570
wait for the effect of these velocity changes to 
take effect. And then you put in another one, and

07:12.491 --> 07:16.114
you wait for it to take effect. So I was actually 
moving rather slowly with respect to the orbiter

07:16.134 --> 07:22.260
and fast with respect to the Earth. As far as 
simulating and testing the MMU goes, a lot of our

07:23.270 --> 07:46.757
development work, both for the M509 unit in Skylab 
and for the MMU and training, was done on a large six

07:23.270 --> 07:46.757
degree of freedom moving base simulator at the 
Martin Marietta Aerospace Company outside of

07:23.270 --> 07:46.757
Denver. This device has a track and a large room, 
about 60 feet long, And a carriage can move up and

07:53.459 --> 07:55.601
down this track. And then on top of the carriage, 
which is about 17 feet wide, is another set of

07:55.661 --> 08:07.114
tracks, which enable a tower that's about 15 or 20 
feet tall to move back and forth. So you can move

08:07.135 --> 08:10.338
anywhere in the room. And then on this tower, 
projecting out from the side of it, able to move up

08:10.358 --> 08:21.711
and down, is a gimbal head that can be driven in 
roll, pitch, and yaw. have a machine that's

08:22.484 --> 08:51.732
man-rated so you can put people in it and build a 
portion of the MMU crew station that controls and

08:22.484 --> 08:51.732
displays into this so you can climb in and by 
inputting the electrical signals from the hand

08:22.484 --> 08:51.732
controllers to a computer and running that into a 
servo system you can cause the thing to behave as

08:22.484 --> 08:51.732
though it were in a weightless environment and in 
fact as though the laws of orbital mechanics were

08:52.572 --> 08:59.603
being obeyed and things of that sort so that we get a 
very realistic simulation. We also designed it so

08:59.643 --> 09:21.516
that you can input intentional malfunctions 
modeled after the system failure modes so that you

08:59.643 --> 09:21.516
can cause a thruster to appear to stick on or a 
battery to fail and things of that sort and require

08:59.643 --> 09:21.516
the pilot to take the appropriate corrective 
action to recover from it and keep flying. By way of

09:22.340 --> 09:31.170
explanation, the MMU for orbiter applications 
was designed to be totally redundant. That is, we

09:31.190 --> 09:42.182
had 24 little compressed nitrogen thrusters 
split into two systems of 12 each, either one of

09:31.190 --> 09:42.182
which was adequate for flying around and 
controlling the shell. So while we normally used

09:46.994 --> 10:14.942
combination of 24 it's sort of like having an 
orchestra where you can split the thing in half if

09:46.994 --> 10:14.942
you do it right and still still play music each 
system had its own battery and its own propellant

09:46.994 --> 10:14.942
tank and its own control logic and its own set of 
switches and the hand controls

09:46.994 --> 10:14.942
so most of the malfunction recovery consisted of 
identifying the system in which the failure had

09:46.994 --> 10:14.942
occurred and shutting the bad system off and 
continuing with what was left By way of testing,

10:16.171 --> 10:41.807
before I get off the training aspect, one of the 
other things that we do is use a weightless

10:16.171 --> 10:41.807
simulation derived from a water tank where you get 
in a pressure suit and there's a certain amount of

10:16.171 --> 10:41.807
air trapped inside it because you pressurized it 
three and a half or four pounds per square inch over

10:16.171 --> 10:41.807
the water pressure. And this makes you buoyant. So 
you add lead weights until you are neutrally

10:46.630 --> 10:51.256
buoyant or displacing as much water as you weigh. 
And then you can maneuver slowly, hand over hand,

10:51.996 --> 10:58.845
and take different attitudes as though you were 
weightless. So we built an MMU that was ballasted

10:58.865 --> 11:12.621
out to be neutrally buoyant as well, and we have a 
mock-up of the orbiter cargo bay in our water tank,

10:58.865 --> 11:12.621
and we developed

11:16.128 --> 11:33.564
flight support station, which is the thing that 
holds the MMU and the orbiter, and also the

11:16.128 --> 11:33.564
procedures for getting into it and getting out of 
it and getting it out of the flight support station

11:16.128 --> 11:33.564
and back in at the end of the mission so you could 
bring it home using the water tank. And this was a

11:33.584 --> 11:45.375
lot of effort put into that since one of the 
problems back in the Gemini program had been the

11:33.584 --> 11:45.375
difficulty of getting into the astronaut 
maneuvering unit And that contributed to Gene

11:46.469 --> 11:52.775
Surin's problems with overheating and fatigue. 
The fact that that worked very well on orbit also

11:52.795 --> 11:57.900
indicates that we did the job right. Testing took a 
number of different forms. We, of course, tested

12:02.324 --> 12:11.053
each of the components at the component level, 
pressure regulators, electronics, control

12:02.324 --> 12:11.053
units, things of that sort. And additionally, the 
MMU and the flight support station subjected to

12:16.473 --> 12:35.360
extreme cold and extreme high temperature runs in 
vacuum to verify that none of the components were

12:16.473 --> 12:35.360
going to fail at high temperatures or that you 
wouldn't have lubricants that congeal at low

12:16.473 --> 12:35.360
temperatures or differential thermal expansion 
and contraction of metallic parts that would bind

12:16.473 --> 12:35.360
up. And in fact, we came up with a few little 
problems each time which were corrected. Then

12:42.930 --> 12:46.395
shortly before the mission, that is about Last 
October, we had two manned thermal vacuum chamber

12:46.848 --> 13:02.010
runs down here at the Johnson Space Center where I 
ran one of them, and I think Pinky Nelson ran the

12:46.848 --> 13:02.010
other one. And we got in pressure suits into this 
large vacuum chamber about 30 feet in diameter and

13:03.111 --> 13:12.585
maybe 50 feet high. which was pumped down to 
probably something less than 10 to the minus 5 or 10

13:13.088 --> 13:30.225
to the minus 6 torr, and had walls cooled with 
liquid nitrogen and a solar simulator being a bank

13:13.088 --> 13:30.225
of arc lights so that we could subject the MNU to 
these streams of temperature as well in there. And

13:30.245 --> 13:37.052
then we went in and manually operated them and 
fired the thrusters and cycled everything to

13:30.245 --> 13:37.052
verify that it worked. And in fact, in that 
context, we also came up with an electrical

13:42.502 --> 13:53.617
problem in the MNUs that, had it not been 
corrected, had the potential of making them

13:42.502 --> 13:53.617
inoperable in orbit. And that was fixed. And it 
looks like we finally got all of the bugs out of the

13:56.040 --> 14:06.034
thing before the mission, which was what we had set 
out to do. At the same time, let me mention that the

14:06.174 --> 14:12.002
folks at Martin, the contractor, built in and who 
were particularly anxious as well to have a

14:12.320 --> 14:22.293
successful mission because they felt like a lot of 
their corporate pride was resting on it. And they

14:22.313 --> 14:27.901
really bent over backwards and did everything 
that they could to make it work. And they did. It

14:28.762 --> 14:29.443
worked very well.

14:34.550 --> 14:42.040
Astronaut Alan Bean said in an interview done by an 
A&M student that his family and marriage were

14:34.550 --> 14:42.040
severely impacted by his career. Do you think your 
family has been impacted by your career? And in so

14:45.196 --> 14:46.618
what way? Well, we came to Texas quite a while ago, 
and we seem to have survived coming to Texas. I

14:56.229 --> 14:59.052
don't think it has really been impacted. I've put a 
lot of work into the program, but seems happy

15:00.634 --> 15:06.020
around here. She has horses. Bruce and Tracy have 
grown up here locally and gone to UT. And, in fact,

15:12.462 --> 15:22.977
Bruce just finished a year at the University of 
Reading in England, got back toward the end of the

15:12.462 --> 15:22.977
summer. So I think we're working on it very well. 
Good, good. You are the newest McCandless to make

15:27.964 --> 15:34.974
significant US history, with your father and both 
grandfathers being outstanding naval men. How do

15:35.775 --> 15:41.203
you feel about carrying on this legacy, and does 
your son continue want to continue in his

15:41.707 --> 15:43.150
tradition? Well, Bruce is interested, 
apparently, in the Foreign Service or perhaps the

15:43.891 --> 15:56.052
law career, as opposed to a naval career, and 
that's certainly his option. I would be the last

15:56.072 --> 15:59.618
person to try to force him into something like 
that. One of my memories from the Naval Academy was

16:00.861 --> 16:05.048
how unhappy those individuals were that had been 
forced into the Naval Academy because Daddy was an

16:05.855 --> 16:13.764
admiral and such and such, or Daddy wanted to do 
this, that, or the other. So it's been strictly his

16:14.765 --> 16:16.247
call. I'm very pleased to have been carrying on the 
Naval tradition, although in all candor, what I

16:17.949 --> 16:33.887
have been doing down here at NASA for the last 
several years is really fairly far removed

16:34.711 --> 16:38.935
driving the ship around on the surface of the ocean 
or flying an airplane off a carrier. It is a

16:40.176 --> 16:44.320
different sort of an ocean, if I can use that 
analogy. And of course, it's also one that the Navy

16:44.340 --> 16:48.664
is currently very interested in. With all of the 
land spaceflight programs, and most

16:50.606 --> 16:57.852
particularly the space shuttle program, we've 
had Earth observations.

17:00.655 --> 17:03.958
Let me call it an experiment or an experimental 
program, basically. It started out back in the

17:04.748 --> 17:27.323
Gemini program with the guys taking pictures out 
the window and saying, gee whiz, look at that, and

17:04.748 --> 17:27.323
has evolved from there to the point where each 
shuttle flight has a number of cameras on board and

17:04.748 --> 17:27.323
we try to take observations of significant 
oceanographic and land-based phenomena. I'm not

17:28.685 --> 17:32.511
talking about pictures of or things like that, 
because we don't get that detail. But we're

17:36.440 --> 17:46.490
looking at volcanic activity, land use patterns, 
ocean currents, eddies, swirls, waves, and

17:36.440 --> 17:46.490
things of that sort. And the Navy has been so 
interested in that that on the last flight, in

17:46.510 --> 18:02.346
fact, we had a civilian naval oceanographer, Paul 
Skelly Powers, who was sponsored by the

17:46.510 --> 18:02.346
oceanographer of the Navy aboard the shuttle 
flight, to go up there personally and make some

17:46.510 --> 18:02.346
observations and take pictures. So the Navy is 
very interested. They're also interested in how

18:04.858 --> 18:13.711
the Navy can use the space station if, in fact, the 
space station comes to pass. I put it that way

18:14.632 --> 18:24.987
because the official position of the Defense 
Department is that they aren't interested

18:14.632 --> 18:24.987
because they don't have any money they want to put 
into it. But if the space station is going to be up

18:25.007 --> 18:33.058
there, the Navy, at least, would like to be there 
using it to observe the oceans and gather data

18:25.007 --> 18:33.058
along those lines.

18:37.004 --> 18:43.494
Has the selection process for NASA astronauts 
changed since you were first selected? And if

18:44.235 --> 18:47.219
there is a change, is it due to the inclusion of 
women? Well, no, the selection process has

18:48.200 --> 18:50.764
changed.

18:53.568 --> 19:01.560
First off, we have gotten away from the concept 
that everybody has to be a pilot. When I came in, I

19:01.844 --> 19:13.875
came in as a pilot astronaut, of course, but at the 
same time, the scientist astronauts that were in

19:01.844 --> 19:13.875
the group before and the group after me all went 
through a flight training to become pilots. The

19:14.055 --> 19:22.522
current mission specialist selectees need not be 
pilots, and if they aren't pilots, why they don't

19:14.055 --> 19:22.522
get trained as pilots? The criteria for selecting 
pilot astronauts is still about the same as when I

19:23.263 --> 19:30.990
came in, maybe a little bit more relaxed since we 
need more people. But as far as physical

19:34.586 --> 19:50.567
qualifications go, in the early days, there was 
this tremendous emphasis on picking the few

19:34.586 --> 19:50.567
individuals that could withstand the physical 
rigors of space flight and things of that sort.

19:50.587 --> 20:01.602
When the shuttle was designed, it was 
intentionally built so that the vast majority of

19:50.587 --> 20:01.602
people that were walking around under their own 
power would be physically qualified. So we've

20:01.818 --> 20:08.264
been able to greatly relieve the physical 
qualifications. In the mission specialist

20:08.284 --> 20:23.157
arena, we're still looking for people with 
advanced degrees in engineering, science, or

20:08.284 --> 20:23.157
medical degrees, reasonable physical health, 
and that are interested in space careers. That's a

20:24.358 --> 20:31.605
lot less stringent than some of the previous 
criteria.

20:31.822 --> 21:01.677
interesting shift is that the first group of 
scientists astronauts that were selected in 1965

20:31.822 --> 21:01.677
were selected based on their already existing 
preeminence in scientific fields the trend in

20:31.822 --> 21:01.677
recent years seems to be to pick people who have the 
educational background but who are just out of

20:31.822 --> 21:01.677
school or perhaps in their late 20s and have a lot of 
potential but haven't necessarily and gotten

21:01.943 --> 21:08.430
themselves all wrapped up in various scientific 
institutions. And of course, it's been broadened

21:10.253 --> 21:13.957
to include women.

21:17.261 --> 21:30.516
And with the payload specialists, NASA doesn't 
really have any criteria that I am aware of for the

21:17.261 --> 21:30.516
payload specialists, other than the fact that 
they be sponsored by their government or company.

21:31.238 --> 21:38.688
and that we get the right of refusal if they appear 
to be unsuited for space flight.

21:42.513 --> 21:51.404
How do you view NASA's future, and are there any new 
plans underway for exploration to other planets,

21:42.513 --> 21:51.404
or maybe a Mars mission as you mentioned earlier? 
Well, NASA first is a research and development

21:52.225 --> 22:01.077
agency.

22:02.710 --> 22:18.504
The agency has surprised itself, I think would be a 
fair statement, by finding that having built the

22:02.710 --> 22:18.504
space shuttle, it's now obligated to operate it, 
as opposed to just building one and saying, gee, it

22:02.710 --> 22:18.504
worked. So there's a little bit of transition and 
progress there in learning to operate it, and to

22:20.206 --> 22:32.076
operate it economically and reliably, by 
reliably I mean on a timetable or schedule. I

22:33.119 --> 23:01.405
wouldn't be at all surprised to see in a few years 
that the whole shuttle program is spun off into

22:33.119 --> 23:01.405
some sort of governmental, quasi-governmental 
corporation, somewhat like the ComSat

22:33.119 --> 23:01.405
Corporation operates, or potentially even 
bought out completely by some sort of team

22:33.119 --> 23:01.405
composed of aerospace industry and airline 
transport. There have been a number of nibbles

23:01.857 --> 23:06.941
along those lines, but nobody has yet come up with 
all the money required. There was also a

23:08.983 --> 23:18.672
realization that the space shuttle, although 
it's neat right now, is not the ultimate space

23:08.983 --> 23:18.672
vehicle. And if you look at ships and airplanes, it 
was opined that a 25-year lifetime was probably a

23:18.972 --> 23:31.763
reasonable lifetime for the space shuttle 
vehicle as a technologically viable entity. And

23:35.543 --> 23:47.242
this meant that about the year 2005, there better 
be something else getting ready to fly, or we'd be

23:35.543 --> 23:47.242
in the dinosaur age, so to speak. And aerospace 
projects seem to take about seven, eight, 10 years

23:47.422 --> 23:53.952
to go from inception to completion. So between now 
and 95 appeared to be a sort of a window that

23:53.972 --> 23:59.421
something could be done in the meantime, or in 
which something could be done. And this was one of

24:03.998 --> 24:14.868
the reasons advanced for doing the space station 
now is to build a space station in this window

24:03.998 --> 24:14.868
before starting to work on a shuttle replacement. 
At the same time, though, there is a considerable

24:14.888 --> 24:29.340
movement building strength to develop a lunar 
base in the early 2000s or the early 20s. perhaps

24:30.316 --> 24:36.863
followed by a Mars mission or something of that 
sort. But all you can say right now is that there was

24:36.883 --> 24:58.264
last week a meeting in Washington that was 
attended by a lot of former astronauts and a lot

24:36.883 --> 24:58.264
of space technology figures, some science 
fiction writers, and the current NASA

24:36.883 --> 24:58.264
administrator, Mr. Webb, and people like that. I 
said Webb, I meant Beggs. They were both Jim, Jim

25:03.813 --> 25:05.836
Webb and Jim Beggs. The current NASA 
administrator, Jim Beggs, and he supported a

25:06.177 --> 25:12.787
future Mars lunar mission. But I've got to point 
out to you that right now there is no money in the

25:12.807 --> 25:18.716
budget for anything like that. The only planetary 
mission that NASA has right now, budgeted, is the

25:23.911 --> 25:30.059
Galileo probe to Jupiter, which was scheduled to 
be launched in 86 from the shuttle, I believe. And

25:30.079 --> 25:42.536
presumably, it would get to Jupiter about three 
years later, put a probe down through the

25:30.079 --> 25:42.536
atmosphere, unmanned, of course, to see if there 
is a surface or see what's below the atmosphere.

25:45.199 --> 25:51.167
So I think eventually, there probably will be some 
sort of return to the moon or go for Mars, and of

25:52.025 --> 26:02.057
course this Jerry Neal space colony thing is a 
potential way of doing it, but right now it's still

25:52.025 --> 26:02.057
quite a ways in the future. The famous words of Neil 
Armstrong as he first walked on the moon have

26:04.359 --> 26:10.767
become a household phrase. If you had the chance to 
give a phrase to history, what would it be? Well, I

26:15.933 --> 26:19.517
took Neil's words and paraphrased them. I was the 
Capcom during Apollo 11 when Neil came back with

26:20.442 --> 26:33.918
his words, after having assured me pre-launch 
that he had nothing prepared and no words in mind,

26:20.442 --> 26:33.918
and he was just going to say something like, oh 
heck, here we are. You were the voice at the Apollo

26:36.421 --> 26:41.547
mission, weren't you, from that, from Houston? 
Right. Yes, I remember that. So I just put these

26:43.949 --> 26:48.954
words on the MMU plate, twisted them around a 
little bit. I'm not really in the business of

26:48.974 --> 26:52.498
leaving phrases for history. Have you really 
enjoyed your career? Has it been something that

26:55.781 --> 27:01.707
you've never regretted and known is the way you'd 
like to go? Oh, this is a thing that's interested me

27:01.727 --> 27:12.859
since,

27:01.727 --> 27:12.859
oh, probably the early 40s. My grandfather, 
Bradley,

27:13.632 --> 27:35.613
discouraged me at the time after I had gotten a book 
on space travel, saying that, yeah, it probably

27:13.632 --> 27:35.613
happened, but not in this century, and I should 
concentrate on more worthwhile things like

27:13.632 --> 27:35.613
command of a battleship or an aircraft carrier or 
something like that. And, of course, things just

27:36.994 --> 27:41.158
came along a lot more rapidly. The space program 
has always been very interesting down here.

27:46.319 --> 27:47.261
There's never a dull moment. So I don't regret any 
of it. Your sisters, Rosemary and Sue, both did an

27:51.328 --> 27:57.519
interview that you grew up looking at the moon. And 
Rosemary even went so far as to say that she was sure

27:57.899 --> 28:06.454
that she had danced on the rooftops one Christmas 
to convince her that there were reindeer there.

28:12.357 --> 28:16.383
No, they just said that you have been very 
interested in space since you were very young. I

28:18.226 --> 28:25.957
have been interested in space, but I've also been 
interested in science and technology in general.

28:26.117 --> 28:29.001
Electronics, finance, chemistry, things of that 
sort. Well, that's about all I have. Okay, well. I

28:33.388 --> 28:35.070
appreciate it. Thank you. I do want to ask you... I 
think Bruce has some tuna sandwiches or

28:37.734 --> 28:40.238
something. Ask the question, hey, are all birth 
defects inherited? Or is it a possibility that in

28:45.113 --> 28:50.422
utero, certain things in the environment will 
cause birth defects? Well, what we have to look at

28:51.464 --> 28:56.192
is a combination of events that transpire. Yes, 
there are selected types of birth defects that are

28:56.833 --> 29:02.343
hereditary. And then there are those that are 
classed as non-hereditary. And so that's what we

29:06.661 --> 29:13.257
want to kind of gear to now and focus on are some of 
the aspects of birth defect. If you will now,

29:13.277 --> 29:20.614
please use the fast forward switch, run this tape 
out, and go to tape two, and we will look at some of

29:13.277 --> 29:20.614
those aspects of birth defects. Please do that 
now.
