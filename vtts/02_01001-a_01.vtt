00:07.810 --> 00:11.796
Oral interview with Sandy Livingood, 18 August 
1988. Your

00:12.016 --> 00:30.865
first tour in Vietnam was June 1964 to December 
1964 and you were a Civil Affairs and

00:12.016 --> 00:30.865
Psychological Warfare Officer with Special 
Forces 1st Corps RVN.

00:32.617 --> 00:36.782
In the beginning, what kind of special forces 
training did you have before you went? Had you had

00:36.822 --> 00:38.704
any at all? I had not had any special forces 
training at all. Transferred from the 173rd

00:42.869 --> 00:53.042
Airborne Brigade on Okinawa to the 1st Special 
Forces Group. Without any special forces

00:53.062 --> 00:59.890
training, I'd had, of course, the airborne 
training and Where did you train? For the airborne

01:01.877 --> 01:04.522
training in the States? Yes, I went through 
airborne school in Georgia in 1965. Had you had any

01:10.631 --> 01:13.415
kind of jungle warfare training? Yes, with the 
173rd we'd had jungle training in northern

01:14.417 --> 01:26.796
Oklahoma

01:14.417 --> 01:26.796
and on a local town called Ariel Moody. I'm not sure 
exactly where it is. I'm not sure that we ever got to

01:29.114 --> 01:34.340
see a map at that time, and if we did, it's been so 
long. As I recall, it wasn't too far from Formosa.

01:38.164 --> 01:42.469
It was one of the, I believe, one of the Ryukyu 
groups. I'm not sure. What percentage of that kind

01:44.991 --> 01:51.599
of training do you think was specifically geared 
towards Vietnam? Probably none of the training

01:51.619 --> 01:57.265
itself was geared towards Vietnam. It was geared 
towards reaction to

01:57.953 --> 02:15.812
a threat within Southeast

01:57.953 --> 02:15.812
Asia, and possibly on the mainland, possibly on 
one of the islands. We trained in the 173rd to meet

02:16.693 --> 02:27.505
all the threats that

02:16.693 --> 02:27.505
were thought of. strictly war planning type of 
training.

02:34.167 --> 02:38.215
Before you went the first time, did you get any 
language training in Vietnamese or French?

02:41.000 --> 02:41.842
Yes. As I recall, I had about three weeks of 
training in a branch of the Language School, the

02:50.030 --> 02:58.862
Department of Defense Language School in 
Okinawa. It was survival training. It was

03:01.646 --> 03:04.050
language survival. It was the very basics and 
enough to give us an idea of how the language was

03:04.951 --> 03:17.809
spoken to develop some accent and to give us the 
ability to make ourselves understood to a very

03:18.886 --> 03:27.898
limited extent. So with that limited experience 
or language training, what kind of language

03:27.918 --> 03:39.233
problems did you encounter when you got to 
Vietnam, or how was the language situation dealt

03:27.918 --> 03:39.233
with when you got there? At the time that I arrived 
in 1964, we had a fairly large number of people

03:45.093 --> 03:53.044
there who spoke English to some extent. 
Interpreters were made available to us. As a

03:57.690 --> 04:08.065
matter of fact, I had an interpreter clerk in my 
section when I arrived. He'd been hired by

04:08.505 --> 04:14.273
previous Civil Affairs Science Officers to work 
for them as an interpreter, translator, clerk.

04:20.566 --> 04:30.198
What specifically were your duties as a psyops 
officer on civil affairs times civil affairs

04:20.566 --> 04:30.198
officer? That is not easy to explain. I guess I can 
best explain it by saying that I was in charge of

04:33.483 --> 04:42.555
supervision, assistance, and planning of the 
Civil Affairs, Psychological Warfare

04:43.447 --> 04:59.431
Operations, or the Special Forces in the First 
Corps, known as I-Corps, Republic of Vietnam.

05:00.753 --> 05:04.900
I coordinated and assisted the aid teams. Those 
were the teams that were out in the provinces

05:04.920 --> 05:09.707
working with the special forces teams, and with 
the Civil Irregular Defense Group, they were the

05:10.565 --> 05:28.301
troops being trained by both U.S. special forces 
and with the Vietnamese special forces. They were

05:29.122 --> 05:39.711
placed in the villages or around the villages, and 
the best I recall about battalion strength and

05:39.978 --> 05:58.597
they established an outpost and patrol from the 
outposts in varying areas of operation, areas of

05:39.978 --> 05:58.597
operation varying in size, varying in size. Some 
maybe 10 square miles, others up to 50 or 60 square

05:58.617 --> 06:09.208
miles, and most of the camps at that particular 
time in June of 1964 were in the populated areas

06:09.526 --> 06:29.652
in the lowland at the base of the mountainous 
areas. These were lowland camps, but they were

06:29.932 --> 06:37.322
close to the mountains. with the exception of the 
one camp at Ashau. They were, and again the one at

06:45.193 --> 06:57.493
Kashan, they were normally at the very edge of the 
fairly densely populated areas.

06:59.136 --> 07:03.343
What kinds of problems did you have training the 
RVN?

07:04.910 --> 07:08.235
We were not training ARVN as such. These were 
paramilitary type troops that we were looking at,

07:08.315 --> 07:19.331
and I was not directly involved with the training. 
My job was directed towards, as we later call it,

07:20.513 --> 07:30.247
winning the hearts and minds of the people. But our 
job was to ensure that it was possible that we would

07:33.682 --> 08:02.912
have a fairly close rapport and interface between 
the Special Forces and with the local villages so

07:33.682 --> 08:02.912
that we would have some close bond between the two 
elements there, the civil government and the

07:33.682 --> 08:02.912
military, as well as the population.

08:04.917 --> 08:14.853
What would you say were the relationships or the 
relations between the Vietnamese and the

08:04.917 --> 08:14.853
Americans in 1964?

08:17.557 --> 08:32.460
There was a great deal of trust between the local 
special forces teams and the villagers.

08:34.820 --> 08:47.875
And in this way we were trying and we felt that our 
job was to further the government of Vietnam image

08:34.820 --> 08:47.875
with the local people. It was not a situation where 
the U.S. Special Forces people wanted to

08:48.036 --> 09:04.675
become the father figure for the villagers. And we 
always tried to take with us when we were doing

09:05.296 --> 09:20.439
our medical calls and sick calls and so forth, we 
wanted to take with us Vietnamese special forces.

09:20.459 --> 09:29.413
And we always had interpreters, of course we had 
guards and Vietnamese soldiers, the

09:20.459 --> 09:29.413
paramilitary. with us and we attempted wherever 
we could to make it known to them that we were there

09:30.035 --> 09:40.268
under the sponsorship of the government.

09:41.129 --> 09:47.358
What do you think was the relationship with the 
South Vietnamese government and the peasants?

09:48.399 --> 09:49.080
Very little. As a matter of fact, this is true 
throughout my entire experience in vietnam the

09:58.722 --> 10:26.670
local villagers really did not identify with the 
with the government itself they identified with

09:58.722 --> 10:26.670
their local village chief and they knew who he was 
but so far as having any identification with the

09:58.722 --> 10:26.670
government in saigon or the government in The 
North, they really had none. It was a matter that in

10:31.637 --> 10:46.198
most cases the Vietnamese are Oriental

10:31.637 --> 10:46.198
people. Whether they be Chinese or ethnic 
Vietnamese or ethnic Cambodian or ethnic Indian,

10:46.218 --> 10:56.893
they still had the Oriental outlook and their life 
was based on the family and the extended family and

10:57.953 --> 11:27.859
their life was based on their religion and on their 
day-to-day child that they did not identify even

10:57.953 --> 11:27.859
with even district government province or 
national government now the relationship

10:57.953 --> 11:27.859
between the government and the local villagers 
was represented by, as I said before, the building

11:28.531 --> 11:32.938
chief. And on occasion they would be visited by 
district and province officials. At that time

11:39.608 --> 11:45.838
they were mostly military officials. The 
district chief would be maybe an army captain or an

11:45.898 --> 11:53.931
army major, depending on the size of the district. 
And the province chief would be either a

11:54.248 --> 12:04.778
lieutenant colonel or a colonel in the Army of the 
Republic of Vietnam Army. How was the

12:05.339 --> 12:08.642
relationship between the ARVN and the U.S. 
military? During this period of time, I was not

12:10.944 --> 12:22.315
really concerned with the Army of the Republic of 
Vietnam, as a matter of fact. At that particular

12:23.037 --> 12:30.726
time, there were only about two Arvin divisions in 
the whole of I-Corps. I believe this has been many

12:30.746 --> 12:35.331
years ago, and I'm trying to recall. I believe it 
was the 1st and 2nd Divisions. And one of those

12:39.476 --> 12:45.684
divisions was stationed at Way and Point 3. And I do 
not recall the location where the 2nd Division was

12:46.965 --> 12:52.892
stationed. But there was no interaction that I 
ever observed between the Army of Vietnam and the

12:53.530 --> 13:05.907
local populace. I guess you might say that I was too 
far out in the woods and the jungle to really see

13:06.888 --> 13:14.118
them. What kinds of project buildings were you 
involved in?

13:23.568 --> 13:28.774
Some of the, I helped to build dispensaries. When I 
say I helped, I personally did very little out with

13:29.014 --> 13:36.021
the A-teams. I was primarily a facilitator. In 
other words,

13:40.646 --> 13:46.493
I was able to give them blueprints. I was able to 
give, and you'll have to realize that a concrete

13:47.053 --> 13:53.440
block or a compressed earth and cement block 
building. It doesn't take much blueprints, but I

13:58.136 --> 14:06.233
was able to give them some idea of the number of 
bricks that it might take. I was able to get the

14:06.374 --> 14:10.423
cement for them. And just to put it quickly, I I 
worked helping them build their own

14:16.488 --> 14:32.589
dispensaries, get them the white paint and so 
forth, and to approve the funds that were

14:16.488 --> 14:32.589
necessary for them to buy the materials if the 
materials were necessary. Of course, bamboo is

14:32.609 --> 14:46.427
readily available in most areas of Vietnam, and a 
lot of their construction was with bamboo, and

14:32.609 --> 14:46.427
even the more permanent buildings, some of them 
had bamboo materials in them. but I was able to get

14:46.694 --> 14:55.045
cut timber and lumber for them. Let's see, we had 
soil factories, and that is a grandiose term for

14:56.026 --> 15:10.845
maybe building a communal building in one of the 
villages and obtaining soil machines and

14:56.026 --> 15:10.845
quality. And these were supposed to be 
semi-cottage industry where the local ladies

15:11.652 --> 15:27.269
could begin to sew, for instance, uniforms for the 
CIDG. And we furnished initially the, I guess

15:27.610 --> 15:33.176
you'd call it seed money. We furnished the 
materials and the sewing machines and so forth.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.803
And they furnished the labor to build the built a 
house, and then they sold their product to the

15:40.846 --> 15:53.578
local people and were able to buy more material and 
carry on making a little pocket money. And it was

15:53.598 --> 16:05.009
hoped to be the beginning of industry, something 
other than strictly rice paddy work. In the area of

16:05.029 --> 16:08.693
the city of Da Nang, which was my personal 
responsibility as part of the B team, which had the

16:09.449 --> 16:20.545
first corps at that time. I worked with an 
American, actually a Canadian missionary who had

16:20.726 --> 16:31.922
been in Southeast Asia for many, many years. And 
I'm saying 30 to 40 years he'd been working in

16:32.543 --> 16:38.832
Indochina. not only in Vietnam, but also in 
Cambodia. And he was sponsoring, through his

16:42.956 --> 16:52.688
church, an orphanage, a leprosarium, and a 
tubercularium. I think that's the way you

16:52.708 --> 16:57.093
pronounce it, tuberculosis sanitary. And the 
leprosarium was just beginning to get off the

16:57.113 --> 17:08.447
ground, and I did a lot of work there. people 
working for me that were experts in construction,

17:08.866 --> 17:14.151
engineers. And with the orphanage, the team 
itself, the orphanage had already been built. But

17:22.600 --> 17:37.455
we worked in that area considerably, helping them 
with additional

17:22.600 --> 17:37.455
things such as a bath house and recreational 
construction. and even, as I recall, a small

17:37.790 --> 17:48.549
merry-go-round

17:37.790 --> 17:48.549
for them. What about strategic hamlets? Were you 
involved in any of the building and relocating of

17:50.893 --> 18:02.413
the refugees to strategic hamlets?

18:03.018 --> 18:07.846
In 1964, the term was strategic hamlet. I don't 
believe it had been invented. Possibly so, but if

18:11.331 --> 18:19.464
it was, it had not reached my area. And these 
strategic hamlets, if they were existing, were

18:20.786 --> 18:28.097
existing further back towards the coast. I was not 
personally involved with the strategic handlers

18:30.119 --> 18:37.409
there.

18:37.430 --> 18:45.121
Were you aware of infiltration on the 
demilitarized zone by the Viet Cong at that time or

18:37.430 --> 18:45.121
vice versa? Were there any special forces groups, 
hunter-killer teams going into the DMZ?

18:53.312 --> 18:58.119
Around the DMZ, we were not aware of it. If it was 
going on, I believe at that time most of our

19:00.983 --> 19:09.237
activity was coming from the Laotian area. 
Primarily the DMZ was

19:10.439 --> 19:26.687
east of the Kashan area and that would probably 
have been the area of operations of the 1st

19:10.439 --> 19:26.687
Division.

19:29.300 --> 19:55.797
our team there at cation was patrolling primarily 
in the islands around the special forces camp over

19:29.300 --> 19:55.797
to the ocean border and i will just comment that 
it's been my recollection and was then that until

19:57.059 --> 20:01.685
July of that year, it was what we call a friendly 
war. There wasn't a lot of

20:02.726 --> 20:20.089
contact between the, there wasn't a great deal of 
military contact between the BC and the

20:02.726 --> 20:20.089
government forces. The reason I say that is 
because the BC efforts were by and large directed

20:27.451 --> 20:32.315
against the civil population. They killed 
doctors, they killed village chiefs, they killed

20:32.335 --> 20:39.422
school teachers. It appeared at that time that the 
effort was being, in our area, the effort was being

20:40.182 --> 20:50.772
carried out against the educated people. They 
were attempting to eliminate education.

20:59.767 --> 21:09.338
In relation to your duties as psyops, officer, 
what kind of psyops tactics were y'all using at

20:59.767 --> 21:09.338
that time, if any? Well, we felt that civil affairs 
itself, the civic action programs that we were

21:09.358 --> 21:17.567
using were psychological warfare. But in 
addition to those, we had available to us

21:25.754 --> 21:27.977
aviation assets to some extent. We had printing 
assets available in Saigon. We dropped leaflets.

21:34.888 --> 21:52.234
We dropped

21:34.888 --> 21:52.234
little care packets, we called them, containing 
tobacco, cigarettes, chewing gum, and a small

21:34.888 --> 21:52.234
comic book wrapped in a baggie, I guess you'd call 
it. We dropped those on the villages along the

21:56.011 --> 22:01.417
border, those that we could find on both sides of 
the border, I think. You have to understand that

22:02.058 --> 22:12.589
once you get into the highlands there, that the 
border is not marked on the ground as a little black

22:02.058 --> 22:12.589
line. And I'm sure there were occasions that we 
found villages on both sides, and possibly we did

22:13.150 --> 22:24.482
drop into Latinas. absolutely that on at least one 
occasion that I did drop some of the propaganda

22:24.732 --> 22:38.749
leaflets and care packets into a village on the 
west side of the international border. And I was

22:39.570 --> 22:45.917
never sure even then that either government knew 
where the border was. We had also loudspeakers,

22:51.513 --> 22:59.080
aviation-mounted loudspeakers that had a 
tremendous coverage. They were loud. We played

23:02.463 --> 23:05.006
Vietnamese tapes. Now, I'm sure that in 
retrospect that this had nothing to do with the

23:05.026 --> 23:19.900
civil populace, but the only possible use it could 
have been would to be maybe discouraging, playing

23:20.825 --> 23:27.233
on the nerves of the Viet Cong who were in there. And 
you must remember that the Highlands were not

23:27.253 --> 23:34.301
Vietnamese, that they were Montagnards. And this 
was our biggest task because we did not have

23:34.321 --> 23:46.275
Montagnard speakers, Montagnard people.

23:48.112 --> 23:51.656
they had languages that no one had ever 
translated.

23:54.359 --> 24:05.511
And each of the Montagnard tribes, their 
languages could be as separate as the languages of

23:54.359 --> 24:05.511
the American Indian. And a distance of 15 miles or 
less that the language of the tribe would change or

24:16.934 --> 24:31.491
the area would change, were that they were 
mutually unintelligible, that people from 15

24:16.934 --> 24:31.491
miles away could not speak to each other and 
understand. And I remember also that they were

24:31.511 --> 24:39.000
still in the Stone Age and possibly still are. I 
don't know. But with the exception of those who

24:41.023 --> 24:45.608
were around there were very few tribes which had 
become even civilized.

25:00.534 --> 25:04.519
The situation was a little bit different. In 
I-Corps, the brew at Kashan, I believe that was the

25:04.539 --> 25:11.950
tribe, were reasonably civilized, but they had 
just come out of the Stone Age or the Bamboo Age,

25:12.166 --> 25:20.134
which hit them. Do you see a lot of culture clashes?

25:25.179 --> 25:29.083
As far as clashing goes, I can't say that I did. It 
was peaceful coexistence with the cultures as far

25:30.365 --> 25:36.611
as I can tell. And primarily the

25:42.760 --> 25:57.456
The one I am most familiar with where I saw the 
Montagnards in large numbers was at the village of

25:42.760 --> 25:57.456
Keishon, and they co-existed quite well. They 
would hold their, when there was a market day, the

25:58.898 --> 26:11.552
Montagnard and the Vietnamese and the Chinese 
were all right at the market, and they bought and

25:58.898 --> 26:11.552
sold to one another. depending upon what they had 
to sell and what they wanted to buy.

26:20.222 --> 26:41.050
In the Khe Sanh area, they have been

26:20.222 --> 26:41.050
civilized long enough that many of the modern 
yards work with the French plantation owners,

26:20.222 --> 26:41.050
called the plantation owners, and they work with 
the Vietnamese in the villages, or in the village

26:41.300 --> 26:47.366
of Khe Sanh. But culture clash, I think they each 
maintained their own culture as they saw fit.

26:55.773 --> 27:02.880
There didn't seem to be any real put down of the 
Montagnards by the local Vietnamese. As a matter

27:03.621 --> 27:08.505
of fact, many of the

27:09.650 --> 27:11.474
paramilitary CIDG.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.868
In the Khe Sanh area, there were Monitors. They had 
been enlisted and trained by the Vietnamese, and

27:17.888 --> 27:26.427
they had their own way, their own their own diet, so 
to speak, and they ate what they could get. As a

27:32.703 --> 27:45.857
matter of fact, throughout my experiences in 
Vietnam, it appeared to me that both the

27:32.703 --> 27:45.857
Vietnamese Moniards and Laotians and Cambodians 
ate what they could get. As far as the religion

27:45.877 --> 27:55.587
goes, of course the Vietnamese were either 
Buddhist or Protestant or Catholic Christians,

27:57.203 --> 28:06.233
and the Montagnards were animist. But that did not 
seem to be anything unusual, with the exception of

28:06.373 --> 28:25.033
the big cities such as Saigon, and

28:06.373 --> 28:25.033
I guess primarily Saigon as far as I can recall. 
There did not seem to be any religious

28:25.655 --> 28:36.712
conflict during, at least that I saw. As you 
probably know, history tells us that President

28:37.393 --> 28:53.198
Zim and his brother and sister-in-law were 
fanatic Catholic, and they did in fact favor the

28:53.954 --> 29:07.333
Catholics of Vietnam, but as far as being 
intolerant of religion, there did not appear to be

28:53.954 --> 29:07.333
any at any place I was in Vietnam. What about the 
Americans in Vietnam? Did you yourself

29:12.420 --> 29:21.193
experience culture shock, or how did you react to 
the different cultures?

29:26.168 --> 29:29.315
I had no real culture shock. I had been in the Orient 
before and I think that I was personally adult

29:29.515 --> 29:46.472
enough to realize that everyone to their own way.

29:48.477 --> 29:53.644
As you know, we've been on Okinawa before I went to 
Vietnam. You know that I had been in Korea prior to

29:53.685 --> 30:03.439
going to Vietnam, Japan, and several other 
places. So culture shock was not something that

30:03.459 --> 30:09.167
was likely to arise with me. I was one of the oldest 
soldiers to go there, and I had learned by this time

30:09.187 --> 30:18.180
to expect the unexpected. And to respect, 
hopefully, the culture of other peoples without

30:19.308 --> 30:36.564
being condescending or to look with disfavor upon 
it. But were there problems with some of the other

30:36.584 --> 30:42.029
people that weren't so educated? Yes, it was not. 
Not especially true within the Special Forces

30:48.248 --> 30:55.719
teams. They did on occasion have some conflict 
with the philosophy of warfare within the Special

30:56.680 --> 31:09.157
Forces. The primary conflicts that I saw in the 
Serbs was the apparent unwillingness of the

31:19.568 --> 31:37.070
Vietnamese to press forward with an attack or to 
pursue

31:19.568 --> 31:37.070
the enemy. This was normal throughout, and there 
were exceptions with the Vietnamese.

31:46.838 --> 31:53.326
The philosophy of the American is once you attack, 
you attack in strength. You attack with

31:53.347 --> 31:59.795
everything that you can bring to bear upon the 
enemy. And once you have started him to retreat,

32:00.215 --> 32:05.462
you pursue with vigor. This was not the overall 
philosophy of the Vietnamese.

32:16.420 --> 32:21.027
were, in my estimation, in many cases, timid. 
Don't take this to mean that they all were. Some

32:25.414 --> 32:40.437
were absolute tigers and would fight through 
everything they had at the enemy and pursue as

32:25.414 --> 32:40.437
a tiger.

32:45.817 --> 32:50.742
Did you think that we could win the war when you left 
in 1964 in December?

32:55.146 --> 33:03.534
Yes, I believe that the policies that we were 
pursuing at that time were the policies that

32:55.146 --> 33:03.534
would, in fact, win the war. At that particular 
time, when I left, there were no American troops as

33:04.675 --> 33:15.385
such. There were no American ground troops on the 
ground in Vietnam. Little did we know what was

33:22.072 --> 33:24.456
going to happen. I think that we were succeeding 
using the policies that we were pursuing at that

33:26.659 --> 33:36.934
time. Which was to gain the friendship of the 
people? Pacification.

33:45.233 --> 33:48.077
Did you know any civilians that first time? Yes, I 
did. I knew a few civilians, not a great number. I

33:56.429 --> 34:05.982
had, as a result of my type of work, I had come to know 
some peasants. I had come to know some merchants

34:06.063 --> 34:14.835
and the Vietnamese people themselves. I like 
them, and I think probably they liked me. On the

34:20.733 --> 34:22.316
other hand, I could be wrong. They could have been 
trying to take advantage of that friendship for

34:22.356 --> 34:34.797
whatever reason, but I doubt it.

34:34.817 --> 34:40.367
How was the esprit de corps of the Special Forces 
and the Americans that were over there? Very high,

34:42.575 --> 34:45.678
very high.

34:48.761 --> 34:58.031
The Americans in Vietnam at that time knew that we 
had a mission, and they believed in their

34:48.761 --> 34:58.031
government. They believed in the methods that we 
were using, and I believe for that reason.

35:07.821 --> 35:11.805
As you know, Special Forces is and was all 
volunteers. And I believe that you'll find a

35:12.275 --> 35:24.868
higher discreet accord in volunteers. And each of 
them had more or less volunteered two or three

35:25.589 --> 35:33.157
times in order to get where they were. And

35:34.299 --> 35:39.624
they were doing quite well. They believed in what 
they were doing. When you believe in what you're

35:42.599 --> 35:46.485
doing, you're free to court. It's always normal.

35:54.277 --> 36:03.430
When you left Vietnam, did the US military ever ask 
you what would be better ways to train our people

35:54.277 --> 36:03.430
that were going over there?

36:06.655 --> 36:07.657
Did they debrief you? I had a debriefing, but It was 
primarily directed towards civil affairs,

36:12.670 --> 36:19.979
psychological warfare, civic action. Did they 
ask suggestions of how to get the Vietnamese

36:20.420 --> 36:26.727
people to help the Americans, or to help us? I don't 
recall what they ever did.

36:32.555 --> 36:39.403
In the year that you were gone, what did you do, and 
did you get any training that was related to

36:32.555 --> 36:39.403
Vietnam?

36:42.202 --> 37:09.981
you're

36:42.202 --> 37:09.981
asking about the period of time between December 
of 64 and December

36:42.202 --> 37:09.981
of 64 as I recall I trained with special forces in 
Taiwan I trained with special forces in Korea and

37:10.619 --> 37:23.621
Both of those were extended exercises from, I 
believe, each one of them was three months or more

37:10.619 --> 37:23.621
in those areas. And we acted in joint exercises in 
both places with U.S. Special Forces and Korean

37:23.641 --> 37:37.183
Special Forces and the Republic of China Special 
Forces were operating in a similar type scenario.

37:48.279 --> 37:52.463
The environments, of course, were different in 
Korea and Taiwan. Taiwan being more jungle-like

37:52.483 --> 38:01.712
and Korea being rather mountainous. As I recall, 
the scenario was that he joined U.S. and would

38:08.551 --> 38:18.300
go into an area, recruit and train

38:08.551 --> 38:18.300
guerrillas. And of course, this was carried out 
under the auspices of the respective governments

38:19.161 --> 38:31.372
and in cooperation with the U.S. Special Forces. 
On the island of Okinawa, we carried out several

38:39.263 --> 38:44.931
small exercises, but I was not directly involved 
with those. My primary duties were preparation of

38:47.435 --> 38:59.072
area studies and studying of the various 
countries within Southeast Asia. At

39:00.134 --> 39:07.785
approximately the time that I came back, possibly 
even before I don't recall the time sequence,

39:08.980 --> 39:17.448
Special Forces Group headquarters was 
re-designated Special Action Forces Asia. And

39:18.810 --> 39:36.507
they were given the responsibility, as I recall, 
sometime during this time, of reacting with

39:18.810 --> 39:36.507
Special Forces and regular troops

39:18.810 --> 39:36.507
in each country of our area of operations. And this 
was from, as I recall, Burma, Laos, Cambodia,

39:40.314 --> 39:48.609
Vietnam, Taiwan, Korea. And I don't believe we had 
a Japan team, but I do know that one of our teams did

39:48.629 --> 39:58.166
go to Japan during that time. I did not

40:03.487 --> 40:10.478
Were you able to use your experiences in Vietnam to 
facilitate any of that training or to help you?

40:10.498 --> 40:14.225
Certainly, certainly.

40:14.525 --> 40:29.730
But it was somewhat difficult to overlay the 
training or the experiences in Vietnam in, for

40:14.525 --> 40:29.730
instance,

40:14.525 --> 40:29.730
Republic of China, Taiwan. since their ideas of 
civil affairs did not exactly coincide with ours,

40:30.605 --> 40:47.867
and we were a guest

40:30.605 --> 40:47.867
in that particular country at the time. And while 
we could influence our own people, it was

40:47.887 --> 40:59.481
sometimes difficult at the higher headquarters, 
and I was in each case at the headquarters, not with

41:00.119 --> 41:25.013
one of the field teams, it was difficult to 
influence the high-ranking Chinese or

41:00.119 --> 41:25.013
high-ranking Korean officers towards this area 
because they were primarily interested in the

41:00.119 --> 41:25.013
morale and welfare of their own troops and the 
guerrillas rather than the –

41:28.098 --> 41:54.645
indigenous or civilian or local populace and 
those type of things were primarily I could

41:28.098 --> 41:54.645
influence our own teams and possibly gain a little 
headway towards the idea of winning hearts and

41:28.098 --> 41:54.645
minds and influencing the from my area down 
through the American team, back across to either

41:55.132 --> 42:12.537
the Chinese or Korean team, back across to the 
civilian populace in that way, rather than trying

41:55.132 --> 42:12.537
to bring it down from the top. It worked better 
coming up from the bottom.

42:18.505 --> 42:19.587
And your second? Touring Vietnam from December of 
65 to December 66, your Civil Affairs and

42:19.938 --> 42:31.491
Psychological Worker Staff Officer with the 
United States 25th Infantry Division. Chu Chi,

42:31.511 --> 42:36.236
RVM, and 3rd Corps Area. Did you, do you feel you did 
a better job the second time in Vietnam?

42:44.266 --> 42:44.526
Will? Or were you more cynical? I don't think I was 
ever cynical.

42:55.063 --> 43:03.895
I still believed in what I

42:55.063 --> 43:03.895
was doing. What was your job? 25th

43:07.100 --> 43:16.573
Division. U.S. 25th Division.

43:21.962 --> 43:34.095
I don't think that I ever became cynical 
concerning the

43:21.962 --> 43:34.095
reasons that we were there. As a matter of fact, I 
was probably to use the term gum-poe in this

43:34.115 --> 43:46.628
particular area of civil affairs and psyops at 
that time. After having studied everything that I

43:47.468 --> 44:03.849
possibly could concerning the areas of 
pacification of the civilian populace, I

43:47.468 --> 44:03.849
believed that it could be done. I was probably 
influenced a lot by my studies and the successes

44:05.431 --> 44:16.885
that the British had had in Malaya. And I had 
believed that properly utilized, and this is

44:20.547 --> 44:43.727
probably about the time that the term strategic 
hamlet came about, that at least when I first

44:20.547 --> 44:43.727
became aware of it, I thought this was going to 
operate and I thought it was going to work. And I

44:44.588 --> 44:47.310
believed that it could. What was the purpose of 
Strategic Hamlet? The Strategic Hamlet was, as I

44:50.082 --> 45:14.142
remember, you take some of the local people, some 
of the boys and men, train them, give them a certain

44:50.082 --> 45:14.142
amount of training, give them a weapon, rifles, 
and light machine guns to protect their own Hamlet

44:50.082 --> 45:14.142
from VidCon. The philosophy was that if there was 
local folks protecting themselves, that it would

45:14.881 --> 45:28.772
deny the VidCon from the right.
