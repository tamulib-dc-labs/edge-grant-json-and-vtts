WEBVTT

00:00:02.427 --> 00:00:08.333
and 90s, did you all think that your program was playing in the major leagues?

00:00:10.535 --> 00:00:11.756
Yes, I think we did.

00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:13.618
I think we did think that.

00:00:13.698 --> 00:00:19.804
Who else in this part of the United States did you all think we were up in the league with?

00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:31.455
I think we consider ourselves comparable to Texas in our programs and with Texas Tech, which has good programs in our area, and with

00:00:31.942 --> 00:00:34.428
I believe we thought we were a little better than Houston.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:44.854
And I think we thought we were about like the other state universities, you know, the major state universities, you know, like Arkansas and Oklahoma

00:00:45.256 --> 00:00:48.262
Now you were recruiting graduate students from broader.

00:00:48.643 --> 00:00:49.725
Yes, by then we were.

00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:51.849
And placing the graduates.

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:52.590
Placing them, yes.

00:00:52.931 --> 00:00:53.592
The graduates.

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:54.494
Right.

00:00:55.416 --> 00:00:56.538
And it was very competitive.

00:00:56.678 --> 00:01:02.269
I mentioned that we took a rather large number in our counseling psychology, but we turned down a lot more.

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:09.339
It was very competitive to get in our counseling psychology program, and that was the bulk of our graduate programs during most of that time.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.224
What about the diversity of those graduate students?

00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:15.167
Yes, we were pretty proud of that.

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:21.135
And at one time, we had in our school psychology program

00:01:21.655 --> 00:01:28.066
more doctoral students that were Hispanic than there were Hispanic psychologists, school psychologists, existing.

00:01:29.187 --> 00:01:30.550
That was a story that went around.

00:01:31.251 --> 00:01:36.319
Kind of hard to confirm, I guess, but it certainly was very active in that.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.925
And the competence of the students had increased?

00:01:40.306 --> 00:01:42.549
I think so, because they're becoming a little more selective.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.798
But I never was thoroughly convinced that

00:01:47.963 --> 00:01:49.546
quality of the students changed a lot.

00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:56.477
I always thought we did have good students all throughout, but it was certainly more competitive to get in toward the end of my time.

00:01:57.258 --> 00:02:03.889
Now, during all these years, you were doing research and publication of what?

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.031
A moderate amount, yes.

00:02:06.414 --> 00:02:07.255
On what topics?

00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:15.830
on typically on testing measurements or attitudes, which was measurement of attitudes.

00:02:18.413 --> 00:02:35.132
I often collaborated with other people and would do the statistical analysis and reporting of whatever they were interested in, you know, like some curriculum matters or things of that kind.

00:02:35.787 --> 00:02:42.196
In the department, how was quality measured among the faculty?

00:02:42.857 --> 00:02:45.581
Was there a review system merit?

00:02:46.722 --> 00:02:47.423
Yes, there was.

00:02:47.764 --> 00:02:53.252
Whenever anybody would come up for a tenure or a promotion, well, the faculty would meet on it.

00:02:53.832 --> 00:02:57.137
Those of professorial rank would especially.

00:02:57.961 --> 00:03:02.687
What about annual, were salaries, were they merit based?

00:03:03.307 --> 00:03:03.828
Yes, they were.

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.613
And what were the factors that were included?

00:03:09.295 --> 00:03:21.049
Well, I think they gave, the intention was to give about equal weight to teaching and to research activities.

00:03:22.784 --> 00:03:30.038
Sometimes it's kind of hard to quantify, you know, and often a lot of disputes about that, just how much that was accomplished.

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.302
But that seemed to be the intention.

00:03:33.344 --> 00:03:39.495
Were there any, during your years, were there any lawsuits, faculty?

00:03:39.535 --> 00:03:44.725
There was one time that, let me see.

00:03:46.915 --> 00:03:57.316
One student claimed sexual harassment against one of our faculty, but it wasn't really on having sexual contact.

00:03:58.018 --> 00:03:59.220
It was more on...

00:04:01.428 --> 00:04:07.937
Not giving respect, as much respect for a woman as for a man, or something like that.

00:04:07.957 --> 00:04:09.099
And something along that order.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:18.192
And I remember that I was on the committee that handled that, and it was cleared out of court.

00:04:19.154 --> 00:04:20.475
But that was quite a hassle.

00:04:21.156 --> 00:04:27.165
But no lawsuits about someone being terminated from the department or anything like that?

00:04:29.963 --> 00:04:43.421
There was one student, this actually happened after I was retired, but it named me as well as all the other faculty, because I had been on the faculty when he was in the program.

00:04:44.121 --> 00:04:49.208
And he had sued for not being treated right as a handicapped person.

00:04:49.228 --> 00:04:52.673
But that was all settled, and I think the university was clear to that.

00:04:54.956 --> 00:04:58.300
What were some of your proudest moments, personally?

00:05:00.136 --> 00:05:04.174
From all these years.

00:05:04.195 --> 00:05:04.275
Yes.

00:05:04.295 --> 00:05:08.273
I was very glad when we...

00:05:08.894 --> 00:05:15.981
when we acquired some special statistical software that I needed and Lannis and Hope and I were instrumental in getting it.

00:05:16.702 --> 00:05:20.306
We had computers but we didn't have very good programs for doing statistical analysis.

00:05:21.107 --> 00:05:36.403
And I was proud when we got better computer facilities and especially when we didn't have to carry around those punch cards anymore and could have more convenient input and output from the computer.

00:05:38.408 --> 00:05:48.318
I was proud of our, in a way, I was proud of our getting a doctoral program.

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:52.883
It meant a whole lot of extra work for me, and sometimes thankless.

00:05:53.003 --> 00:05:56.687
But it was something challenging for me, very challenging.

00:05:56.767 --> 00:06:01.592
And I had a large role to play in that.

00:06:02.453 --> 00:06:06.357
And so I had a certain amount of satisfaction from that.

00:06:06.691 --> 00:06:08.695
Now, did you all have to go before the coordinating board?

00:06:08.795 --> 00:06:09.577
Yes, we did.

00:06:09.617 --> 00:06:15.890
And it turned out to be a very successful program, you know, on the whole, on balance, I think.

00:06:16.712 --> 00:06:20.059
Certainly a large program.

00:06:27.464 --> 00:06:30.288
I received several teaching awards, as you probably know.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.654
It was kind of satisfying to get that.

00:06:33.674 --> 00:06:34.315
Including?

00:06:35.978 --> 00:06:40.425
I received the University Teaching Award for the, I didn't get a watch.

00:06:40.465 --> 00:06:44.471
No, it was a, this was a Standard Oil Teaching Award.

00:06:44.952 --> 00:06:52.003
And then I got the, received the Former Students Award for Colleges twice.

00:06:51.983 --> 00:06:56.509
And then I received something called the Crystal Apple Award.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:03.177
And then I mentioned that one from San Antonio, and I have several other recognitions like that.

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:08.564
And it all gives you a little lift, you know, when something like that happens.

00:07:08.684 --> 00:07:17.856
Any good anecdotes of running into a student in some truly unexpected place who had a kind word to say?

00:07:19.642 --> 00:07:25.911
Well, not in the form of an anecdote, but it has happened, and it is a good feeling.

00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:28.655
I know what you're referring to, and it is a very good feeling.

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:31.539
Let's see.

00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:41.273
What about some important national or international event that you remember exactly where you were when you heard the news that?

00:07:42.535 --> 00:07:46.020
Well, I mentioned a while ago that Len Hanna and I remember that we were

00:07:46.557 --> 00:07:49.902
on the badminton courts in G. Riley White when Kennedy was assassinated.

00:07:49.922 --> 00:07:50.764
How did you hear that?

00:07:51.785 --> 00:07:57.835
When we got out of our shower, finished our game, got our shower, and got out on the street, it was a buzz all out on the street.

00:07:58.496 --> 00:08:03.705
Crossing the street from G. Riley White to MSC, that's about as far as we got without hearing about it.

00:08:03.725 --> 00:08:05.007
Oh, did you hear the president shot?

00:08:05.027 --> 00:08:05.848
The president shot.

00:08:06.284 --> 00:08:11.295
Art, when I first heard that, I was also stunned because it had happened in Dallas.

00:08:11.436 --> 00:08:12.037
Yes.

00:08:12.057 --> 00:08:13.200
Me too.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.184
Me too.

00:08:15.345 --> 00:08:15.545
All right.

00:08:15.565 --> 00:08:24.225
Well, I remember, too, the one night I was on the way home from a 5 to 8 p.m. class, or maybe even later,

00:08:24.998 --> 00:08:32.350
and had the radio on in the car and heard about Martin Luther King being assassinated on my way home from an 8 o'clock class.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.794
We hadn't heard about it while I was in class.

00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:49.437
And then toward the end of my teaching career, maybe the last year, I was teaching another one of those 5 to 8 p.m. classes in Little Harrington, Short Harrington.

00:08:50.716 --> 00:08:57.975
I gave them a short recess, and when they came back in, they said that we're bombing Iraq.

00:09:00.222 --> 00:09:01.124
And what shall we do?

00:09:01.625 --> 00:09:02.829
The beginning of Desert Storm.

00:09:02.849 --> 00:09:04.152
Right.

00:09:05.498 --> 00:09:07.601
reacted to that a little bit as a class.

00:09:07.661 --> 00:09:09.123
It was a big class in this case.

00:09:09.143 --> 00:09:11.386
I didn't have many big classes, but that happened to be.

00:09:12.387 --> 00:09:14.310
And so we reacted to that a little.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.795
I said, well, I guess there's nothing for us to do but go on with our statistics class.

00:09:18.396 --> 00:09:19.137
That's what we did.

00:09:20.098 --> 00:09:21.420
Let me turn it off.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:28.850
One time, Lannis Hope had a TV in his office because it was used for instruction and counseling.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.212
They would run videos, you know.

00:09:30.933 --> 00:09:33.396
And anyway, he had that TV in there, and

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.809
when Reagan was shot, not killed, but shot, we all gathered around that TV and watched that.

00:09:41.129 --> 00:09:41.930
I remember that day.

00:09:42.771 --> 00:09:59.874
As you look back over all those years, and I'm going to ask the negative, to what people would you give the highest marks for the progress made in the department and in the college?

00:10:02.036 --> 00:10:03.298
Who deserves the greatest

00:10:04.544 --> 00:10:09.871
Well, I'm going to be slanted more toward the college and the department, because that's what I know most about.

00:10:09.931 --> 00:10:13.175
I know very little about some of the other.

00:10:13.816 --> 00:10:27.413
But I would say Walter Varvel and Paul Henseling and Frank Hubert and Earl Rutter and Jack Williams.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:42.419
I think Christopher Borman happened to be real good for us at a particular time.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:50.979
He was in educational psychology, he was department head, and then he was interim dean for a while.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.523
That was while you were away.

00:10:52.503 --> 00:10:57.991
He's now in some kind of dean position at UT San Antonio.

00:10:58.452 --> 00:11:01.196
But he was real good and had a good influence on me.

00:11:02.137 --> 00:11:18.241
And some people that have had a good influence on me and my teaching and my work have been Jack Campbell, Carl Landis, and Earl Webb.

00:11:18.982 --> 00:11:21.025
He was in ag education.

00:11:21.207 --> 00:11:22.769
Earl Kniebel, too.

00:11:22.809 --> 00:11:40.633
He was in ag education.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.861
Well, you'll think of others.

00:11:44.881 --> 00:11:45.842
I'll think of them, yeah.

00:11:45.862 --> 00:11:48.165
Did you ever think about leaving, going somewhere else?

00:11:48.826 --> 00:11:49.767
You know, I never did.

00:11:50.447 --> 00:11:51.729
I never did think about that.

00:11:51.749 --> 00:11:53.871
I just wanted to stay here.

00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:54.472
Why not?

00:11:55.493 --> 00:12:03.522
I was satisfied and I could see a future in it, you know, and if I wanted to do something else, I thought opportunities were there for that.

00:12:03.582 --> 00:12:10.249
I didn't want to do anything else, but I thought even if I did, there were opportunities for other things besides what I was doing.

00:12:11.191 --> 00:12:19.963
And I liked the town, liked the size of the town, more then than now, really.

00:12:20.844 --> 00:12:25.490
And I did not have much interest in leaving, did not.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:31.257
Do you think that you and your colleagues generally felt that you were part of something that was happening?

00:12:31.798 --> 00:12:33.881
Yes, I do feel that.

00:12:35.663 --> 00:12:39.308
Are there, in hindsight now, with the clarity of hindsight,

00:12:39.575 --> 00:12:46.709
Are there some opportunities for either the program in the department or the college, were there some opportunities that were missed?

00:12:46.729 --> 00:12:49.514
Are there some things that A&M might have done that it didn't do?

00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:52.460
Let's see.

00:12:56.448 --> 00:13:00.756
You know, I think we could have probably,

00:13:06.187 --> 00:13:21.945
Been kinder to students sometimes, made things a little easier for them, make transitions easier for them, and maybe offer our courses more frequently so they didn't have to sweat out getting those courses, things like that.

00:13:23.087 --> 00:13:30.035
And I think maybe that we could have offered more courses by having a little larger teaching load than we did.

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:35.181
Are there some other specialties, some other fields in the general area

00:13:35.768 --> 00:13:39.354
of educational psychology that A&M should have done?

00:13:39.374 --> 00:13:43.542
No, we covered that very well, yeah.

00:13:43.562 --> 00:13:48.250
We didn't get into clinical psychology, but the psychology department had that covered.

00:13:49.993 --> 00:13:58.688
And did, at the timing of when the various steps were taken, did those now look like they were about

00:13:59.933 --> 00:14:01.455
at the appropriate sequence?

00:14:01.475 --> 00:14:10.045
Well, I think sometimes it was just a matter of chance or opportunity or, you know, accident maybe.

00:14:10.105 --> 00:14:13.970
But looking back, it seems to be a pretty steady pattern.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:18.556
But I think a lot of times it was just serendipitous that things happened when they did.

00:14:18.616 --> 00:14:22.601
Okay, now I've just about run out of questions.

00:14:22.621 --> 00:14:24.203
Well, I've about run out of answers.

00:14:24.263 --> 00:14:26.886
What topics have we not, have we?

00:14:27.288 --> 00:14:29.812
I think you've been very thorough, Haskell, and I've enjoyed it.

00:14:30.153 --> 00:14:38.085
All right, let's make believe that someone walks up to you and hands you a check for a million dollars with one requirement.

00:14:38.105 --> 00:14:44.175
You must pass it on to Texas A&M, but you decide the use that will be made of that gift.

00:14:44.896 --> 00:14:50.886
If you could make a major gift to Texas A&M, for what purpose would you want that money given?

00:14:52.688 --> 00:14:54.291
Well, I would...

00:14:54.946 --> 00:14:59.578
probably give, at least for the most part, an undesignated gift.

00:14:59.598 --> 00:15:08.079
I wouldn't want to make those choices because I think others are in a much better position to know the priorities and everything.

00:15:08.961 --> 00:15:12.550
I would give an undesignated gift.

00:15:14.605 --> 00:15:16.450
Okay.

00:15:16.631 --> 00:15:17.734
The last question then.

00:15:17.754 --> 00:15:30.589
And part of that is because I do trust the administration and the policies and the, not just the individual administrators, but the links between them and the procedures that they follow.

00:15:31.109 --> 00:15:37.579
By the way, I voted against a student senate, I mean a faculty senate.

00:15:37.599 --> 00:15:48.036
One of my frustrations with faculty senates is the faculty senate never does anything about the faculty colleagues that don't carry a fair load.

00:15:49.018 --> 00:15:52.483
They don't think that's their task.

00:15:53.185 --> 00:15:54.687
When you retired in what year?

00:15:55.274 --> 00:15:55.876
It was 93.

00:15:55.896 --> 00:15:56.558
93.

00:15:57.601 --> 00:16:00.549
And was that handled well?

00:16:00.609 --> 00:16:01.732
Did you feel good about?

00:16:02.193 --> 00:16:02.655
Very good.

00:16:04.199 --> 00:16:05.061
What did they do?

00:16:05.102 --> 00:16:10.296
Were there any special events, thank yous?

00:16:10.732 --> 00:16:16.645
Yes, we did have a retirement party, and it was shared with Art Roach and Landis Hope and myself.

00:16:16.886 --> 00:16:18.629
We had a very nice party.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:19.992
You young guys all together.

00:16:20.053 --> 00:16:20.574
That's right.

00:16:21.656 --> 00:16:27.930
And it was over in the Rudder Tower, one of the meeting rooms over there, and it was a very nice occasion.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:30.934
And I'm real satisfied with my retirement benefits.

00:16:31.095 --> 00:16:34.600
I was under teacher retirement, and we've been treated very fairly.

00:16:36.522 --> 00:16:39.847
Starting next month, we're getting a nearly 11% increase, you know.

00:16:40.869 --> 00:16:45.235
And that was not really expected because it's not built in as a cost of living.

00:16:46.377 --> 00:16:47.358
So, last question.

00:16:47.518 --> 00:16:50.723
What feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M today?

00:16:51.624 --> 00:16:53.026
How do you feel about this place?

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.192
Well, I am...

00:16:57.914 --> 00:17:00.580
I appreciate what A&M has done for me.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.183
It's given me a good place to work.

00:17:03.045 --> 00:17:08.778
It's given me opportunities to do what I wanted to do and facilitated my doing it.

00:17:10.061 --> 00:17:13.729
I've enjoyed the recreational

00:17:13.709 --> 00:17:18.074
things here, being able to work out at the gym all these years and still doing it.

00:17:19.156 --> 00:17:31.531
I've enjoyed the athletic events and some of the cultural events, and I made a good living and made a good retirement and raised my children and had a successful career.

00:17:31.872 --> 00:17:36.898
I was able to finish a successful career, so I feel very good about it and very grateful about it.
