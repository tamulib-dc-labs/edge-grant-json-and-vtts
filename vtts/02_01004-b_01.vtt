WEBVTT

00:03.676 --> 00:29.262
Flower children would try

00:03.676 --> 00:29.262
to sell paper-made flowers or any kind of flowers 
for exorbitant prices,

00:03.676 --> 00:29.262
talk other children into joining with them. and 
bring in whatever thing they could from home that

00:30.743 --> 00:34.847
could be sold for money.

00:37.530 --> 00:39.632
You know, to buy food, because they was hungry.

00:45.417 --> 00:46.718
Sell them, took a bath.

00:51.863 --> 00:54.866
As far as a crime problem, they didn't create much. 
As a nuisance problem, they worked.

01:03.059 --> 01:08.047
How do you distinguish that with the hippies?

01:08.067 --> 01:12.635
The hippies were not organized in the way they 
were. They were, hippies more or less, were on a

01:12.816 --> 01:22.712
individualistic, I'll do my own thing, kick.

01:26.799 --> 01:29.083
They weren't in groups. There might be one or two or 
three running together, but not 50 or 75 as a group

01:29.587 --> 01:38.103
that all lived in one room.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.431
They stunk about the same.

01:48.161 --> 01:52.489
They were probably both still about the same, but 
they were not the organized.

01:57.785 --> 02:03.433
commune type, as the class order was.

02:06.858 --> 02:11.745
Any crime aspect of the hippies, other than just 
shoplifting or stealing? They're just, at that

02:11.825 --> 02:22.780
time, they were more or less just a drag on society 
in that they would do whatever it was, to make their

02:24.430 --> 02:26.752
own thing. If they wanted a fountain pen, they went 
by the nearest post office to write a letter and

02:26.772 --> 02:34.559
steal a fountain pen on the counter. If they didn't 
want a fountain pen, they took it in and out because

02:34.579 --> 02:41.326
somebody else might want one. They weren't 
stealing. It was just a way of existing. If they

02:46.370 --> 02:51.535
wanted a bath, they went to the nearest pillow 
station restaurant, locked the door, and took

02:46.370 --> 02:51.535
their bath. or they went to your local department 
store. We've got people now that are doing the same

02:56.278 --> 02:58.100
thing. They call them the street people. The names 
change. Your actions

03:02.886 --> 03:10.755
don't. How would you describe any anti-war 
movement in Fort Worth in response to the anomaly?

03:21.788 --> 03:23.030
Was there any in Fort Worth? I can't answer that 
very well. I don't know. There wasn't enough to

03:28.958 --> 03:31.522
make a big impression on me. And that would have 
been during the time, I think. You would have

03:36.649 --> 03:40.234
noticed. It was in the late 60s. There wasn't 
enough of it to make any impression on me. I don't

03:44.380 --> 03:44.680
know.

03:49.547 --> 03:49.647
Okay. Point that question on.

03:57.749 --> 04:09.566
When something would occur, any kind of incident, 
either between blacks or between blacks and

03:57.749 --> 04:09.566
police, would this always be local people? Is it 
possible sometimes to be an outside instigator?

04:17.057 --> 04:23.527
Now, by local, you mean in this same neighborhood 
or within the same town? Same town. Some of that was

04:24.293 --> 04:32.045
in the right context in their area, or they weren't 
from someplace else? No, frequently we've had

04:32.145 --> 04:51.735
disturbances or incidents come up where they were 
provoked or enlarged upon or more notoriety

04:32.145 --> 04:51.735
caused by people from other parts of town or other 
neighborhoods entirely that were not involved in

04:53.673 --> 05:00.659
that incident at all. They'd get like a commotion.

05:07.725 --> 05:11.168
Any examples that you can come up with off hand? One 
that I can personally go on, two or three, but one

05:11.188 --> 05:23.038
that I can personally go on is one I was involved in 
out here on Amanda and stopped our section of town

05:11.188 --> 05:23.038
called Stop Six. We had

05:23.828 --> 05:30.917
a domestic disturbance, I believe it was, come up. 
And we had a couple of cars respond to the call,

05:32.459 --> 05:40.390
which happened to be in front of a nigger's beer 
joint on Sunday afternoon. Everybody's out

05:40.550 --> 05:42.472
walking the streets anyhow. And

05:44.175 --> 05:52.165
upshot of it was, we wound up, we're going to take 
the mail

05:55.418 --> 06:00.846
that was involved in the dispute to jail.

06:00.866 --> 06:10.219
I don't remember now whether he was drunk, drunk in 
a public place.

06:11.401 --> 06:14.085
What the charge was, when A man that I didn't know, a 
black man I didn't know, started all kind of

06:15.803 --> 06:25.371
yelling and hollering, you're not going to take my 
brother, my brother this, my brother that. I knew

06:27.293 --> 06:28.594
the black people were arresting. I didn't know the 
man that did all the hollering. I asked one of the

06:32.297 --> 06:40.885
local people that lived in stop six that hung 
around those beer joints all the time who that man

06:32.297 --> 06:40.885
was. Nobody knew him. He wasn't from around there.

06:49.148 --> 06:55.275
This is a sample of the outside agitation that 
could provoke an incident. I think nearly all, I

06:57.598 --> 07:14.278
don't know about now, but at one time, all of your 
racial riots started with a damned old nigger

06:57.598 --> 07:14.278
woman screaming. that wasn't involved in the

07:15.912 --> 07:28.608
original incident. I don't understand that. If 
you've got a policeman, say a policeman out here

07:30.751 --> 07:42.325
arresting 18 and 19 year old blacks, And then here 
comes a 25 to 45-year-old black female raising all

07:44.768 --> 07:52.323
kinds of hell, screaming and obscenities and 
everything else. The public in that area gets a

07:53.285 --> 07:55.830
riot. Practically all of your racial riots have 
involved that damned old black female.

08:05.769 --> 08:07.232
It started with her being a holler.

08:20.932 --> 08:25.316
I know you hit on it earlier, and this is a little 
repetitious question. What did the male officer

08:27.799 --> 08:35.226
think when women started moving out into the law 
enforcement, into the field?

08:44.094 --> 08:50.280
Generally, the

08:44.094 --> 08:50.280
officers that were working at that time

08:54.479 --> 08:58.346
Of course, they grew up in their police 
experience, all males.

09:01.972 --> 09:16.758
And at a time when physical involvement was 
required, you

09:01.972 --> 09:16.758
wouldn't want to be a partner with a female. You 
wouldn't want her on the same call with you.

09:20.146 --> 09:33.122
because at that time the general idea was to 
respect womanhood, not involved in the

09:20.146 --> 09:33.122
unpleasant scenes and actions that a policeman 
necessarily got involved in. Wouldn't want her to

09:34.824 --> 09:39.910
call the names of policemen once.

09:43.114 --> 09:50.102
I guess as big of an issue as anything else that she 
would not be capable of taking care of herself

09:43.114 --> 09:50.102
physically. and that you'd have to take care of 
her, plus yourself, plus trying to solve the

09:50.690 --> 10:03.106
incidents you were involved in, would create a 
hardship for the man.

10:05.749 --> 10:14.560
Plus, some of the officers' wives didn't want 
their husbands riding with females. That's the

10:14.580 --> 10:15.381
other piece.

10:23.697 --> 10:31.450
You make it sound like there's a question as to a 
woman's ability to do police work. A woman is

10:33.072 --> 10:39.683
physically capable of doing some of the police 
work.

10:42.788 --> 10:50.380
Very few of the women are emotionally capable.

10:53.870 --> 10:59.656
There's necessarily a difference between male 
and female emotions.

10:59.676 --> 11:23.218
There are some exceptions, but

10:59.676 --> 11:23.218
the ones, for the most part, that have been hired 
here,

10:59.676 --> 11:23.218
their physical requirements were not comparable 
to physical requirements for men. So that if the

11:25.595 --> 11:44.132
officer is involved in a fight, most of the time, he 
can depend on the woman to take care of her share

11:25.595 --> 11:44.132
of it. Give me an example. I don't know how dominant 
women were on the . Any examples from the ? Did

11:54.603 --> 11:59.129
something occur at one point that said she didn't 
handle herself in this fight? Well, at this

12:00.351 --> 12:04.717
particular point, let's take this issue. At one 
time, while I was a sergeant, I was assigned to the

12:07.321 --> 12:22.703
patrol captain's office, working in there 
handling phone calls and people that came in with

12:07.321 --> 12:22.703
problems. A cab driver came in, said, I've got a 
drunk up there in my cab. He's too drunk to pay his

12:30.357 --> 12:32.980
fare. I brought him here to get him put in jail. I'm 
assigned to the office. I catch an officer that's

12:38.408 --> 12:44.056
walking along the hall, which happens to be a 
female. Tell her to go get the drunk out of the cab.

12:47.981 --> 12:48.482
Put him in jail.

12:51.266 --> 12:51.947
The captain said, I don't think I ought to let a 
female do that by herself. She might get hurt for me

12:57.108 --> 13:00.011
to get up off my butt and go help her. She's the 
officer that's getting paid to do the job that her

13:01.953 --> 13:10.683
supervisor told her to do.

13:10.703 --> 13:13.385
This is the attitude that exists. A woman is 
physically incapable in some instances. It

13:19.792 --> 13:20.733
wasn't a typical dunk. This one wasn't even 
fighting.

13:33.153 --> 13:34.354
That's what she gets paid for. She gets a full 
salary. Not a partial salary. She gets a full

13:39.100 --> 13:41.683
salary. That's what she hired out to do. This type 
of

13:45.467 --> 13:50.273
thing. Do you think women are accepted by men on the 
force today any more than they were? Yes,

13:55.780 --> 14:00.265
they're accepted more. There's more of them. and 
the males have been

14:03.342 --> 14:15.739
exposed to them from the beginning, some of our 
younger officers.

14:18.663 --> 14:26.674
But

14:18.663 --> 14:26.674
I don't necessarily see if that makes it any 
better.

14:31.801 --> 14:32.742
So many times, The

14:33.329 --> 14:44.661
females are necessarily different from the 
males. And

14:44.681 --> 15:02.661
their assignments and job performance 
evaluations,

14:44.681 --> 15:02.661
friendships, are frequently based on sexual 
attraction rather than police performance.

15:12.597 --> 15:30.301
What do you think of the tendency, I'm not sure what 
Fort Worth PD's policy is, but the tendency of

15:12.597 --> 15:30.301
police departments to seek out and hire college 
graduates or people with some of the hours of

15:12.597 --> 15:30.301
college as officers?

15:30.882 --> 15:39.573
When I started, the requirement was high school 
education, high school diploma, or I think they

15:30.882 --> 15:39.573
called it GED.

15:40.174 --> 15:42.317
In the mid-60s, they Fort Worth, along with every 
other department of the country, got on a higher

15:43.175 --> 15:58.097
education kick,

15:43.175 --> 15:58.097
which has resulted here. And I believe now they 
require either 20 or 30 hours of college education

15:59.560 --> 16:06.670
before you can even apply. What do you

16:06.690 --> 16:12.439
think? Are there benefits to this, you think, or is 
it just a remnant of it? I think it's just a

16:19.167 --> 16:21.850
carryover.

16:24.433 --> 16:36.647
Personally,

16:24.433 --> 16:36.647
a policeman's job is

16:24.433 --> 16:36.647
a good memory and common sense.

16:41.112 --> 16:41.953
Distress. on higher education,

16:42.777 --> 17:01.074
they're not going to improve the policeman a whole

16:42.777 --> 17:01.074
lot. How is it justified when a person,

17:01.094 --> 17:09.281
what was the desire of having a higher educated 
police officer? Oh, the higher the education, the

17:09.361 --> 17:11.603
more they pay you. The higher the education, the 
more chance for advancement. Some of the city's

17:18.387 --> 17:40.830
jobs or, well, even in the police department, they 
developed the

17:18.387 --> 17:40.830
policy there of

17:18.387 --> 17:40.830
up until they tended to be a high school education, 
the captain had to have college, the deputy chief

17:18.387 --> 17:40.830
had to have a master's degree, To be a chief, you had 
to be a super wheel. This type of evolution pushing

17:44.463 --> 17:49.807
our education.

17:53.811 --> 18:06.361
How

17:53.811 --> 18:06.361
would you describe the way the Fort Worth Police 
Department worked with the FBI? Was it a frequent

18:06.421 --> 18:10.885
thing, or infrequent, or beneficial, or pain?

18:18.965 --> 18:27.453
FBI on a very favorable

18:18.965 --> 18:27.453
basis. I knew, got acquainted with, and knew 
practically all of the officers, the FBI's info

18:27.473 --> 18:36.480
was in several endowments. And I've never had a 
problem with any of them. Well, when they got the

18:47.804 --> 18:50.147
time I was assigned to internal affairs.

18:53.811 --> 19:02.781
Frequently, they got complaints involving the 
same complaints I was making the investigation

18:53.811 --> 19:02.781
on. They'd hold off doing anything until I 
finished my investigation and it just takes the

19:02.801 --> 19:09.668
results of mine. That's what they basically hold 
the investigation

19:09.688 --> 19:16.596
on.

19:20.947 --> 19:43.039
they got their rules they've got to go by and

19:20.947 --> 19:43.039
ours were not necessarily the same as theirs but uh 
we had no problem

19:20.947 --> 19:43.039
okay

19:20.947 --> 19:43.039
um regarding illegal drug use, possession, and 
sales have weakened a lot in the past. The laws

19:49.216 --> 20:00.490
concerning illegal drug use, sales, possession, 
all aspects of drugs seem to weaken over the past

19:49.216 --> 20:00.490
probably decade or so. I'm not sure of the time 
frame. Why has this occurred? After using it. If

20:12.280 --> 20:24.842
you have a statewide speeding limit at 40 miles per 
hour, 10% of your people are going to exceed that

20:12.280 --> 20:24.842
speed limit, regardless of what it is. If 15% 
exceed it, and their average is 45, you're not

20:25.003 --> 20:34.059
going to raise that speed limit to 45 miles per 
hour. But 10% are still going to exceed it. In other

20:38.808 --> 20:42.593
words, you're going to have a 10% above that, 
regardless of what the limit is. When you set that

20:43.634 --> 20:59.376
limit where the majority of your people abide by it 
and are reasonably comfortable with it, that is

20:43.634 --> 20:59.376
your acceptable law. The same with your guns.

21:08.812 --> 21:20.930
A drug, say alcohol, and 10% of the people are going 
to abuse

21:08.812 --> 21:20.930
it. If you try prohibition, it don't work. You've 
got to adjust to a medium that the majority of the

21:25.477 --> 21:36.473
people can live with and accept and be willing to 
abide by.

21:37.634 --> 21:39.256
The law is too restrictive.

21:45.021 --> 21:50.867
It's going to be violated so many times that you 
can't enforce it. If it's too lenient, there are

21:50.887 --> 22:00.797
going to be such flagrant abuses that the public 
will require something to be done.

22:00.817 --> 22:04.121
This is what's made the adjustment, I believe. And 
you're more lenient. At the same time, some of your

22:08.026 --> 22:12.272
drug laws are tightened up considerably.

22:15.597 --> 22:29.998
Now, you have the cities, counties, states, and 
federals taking a mass property away from

22:15.597 --> 22:29.998
you. It is convicted of drug sales, and they think 
they can prove it. that this property was bought

22:38.401 --> 22:41.865
with money made from drug sales. That's 
reasonable. That's a hell of a lot tighter than it

22:45.029 --> 22:48.413
used to be, because it used to, you couldn't do 
that. You can even take a man's home away from him if

22:50.015 --> 23:04.893
he thinks it's, or feel like he can feel that it was 
bought, but it resulted in the sale of the

22:50.015 --> 23:04.893
property. It's not necessarily all Orleanian 
laws. There have been other tatter laws passed

23:08.287 --> 23:10.309
too.

23:14.754 --> 23:23.804
What do you think the police, what's your opinion 
of these changes, both the tightening and the

23:14.754 --> 23:23.804
weakening? Well, my opinion wouldn't make a whole 
lot of difference because we're not really

23:26.067 --> 23:31.493
involved in it. But your police department, 
whether it's Fort Worth or anywhere else, is like

23:34.780 --> 23:41.366
any competitive business. They're in a process of 
continuous change. They're not a static

23:48.612 --> 23:53.276
organization that will remain the same from now 
on. They've got to change

23:54.097 --> 24:04.686
the technology, the attitude, the laws that have 
been passed. to the personnel that they're able to

24:06.404 --> 24:09.609
employ. They've got to be adaptable

24:11.492 --> 24:19.205
to a constant change. Because that's what the 
organization

24:20.928 --> 24:26.677
is. OK. Spent a year in internal affairs.

24:35.412 --> 24:38.916
What do you remember most about that time? How 
would you describe your time at Toronto Fair? Oh,

24:44.503 --> 24:52.072
that gets kind of involved.

24:54.434 --> 25:02.584
Really your internal affairs organization is set 
up to

25:04.960 --> 25:14.290
investigate

25:04.960 --> 25:14.290
complaints involving police

25:04.960 --> 25:14.290
officers. The complaints can be from the public, 
or the police officers,

25:15.792 --> 25:28.926
or the administration of the police department. 
If a deputy chief or chief wants a certain thing

25:30.155 --> 25:37.024
investigated, he can request it. The way ours is 
set up, or was at that time, they initiate no

25:37.044 --> 25:43.793
investigations on their own. They operate 
strictly off of complaints. And they make no

25:50.201 --> 25:55.808
recommendations.

26:00.091 --> 26:25.405
We had the policy at that time that if it was an 
officer involved

26:00.091 --> 26:25.405
and a

26:00.091 --> 26:25.405
copy of the whole investigation would be turned 
over to his immediate supervisor for the first

26:00.091 --> 26:25.405
recommendation of what should be done. Then it 
went to the second level supervisor on up to the

26:31.276 --> 26:57.452
deputy chief of that particular division and then 
the results of all of it went to the chief who makes

26:31.276 --> 26:57.452
the final decision because that's what his job is 
and his decision is what it counts now he can concur

26:31.276 --> 26:57.452
he can change raise or lower but it's his decision 
that's got to be the final one with the internal

27:00.183 --> 27:05.709
affairs section made no recommendation at all.

27:10.255 --> 27:26.393
Another factor there is that your minority 
groups, ACLU,

27:10.255 --> 27:26.393
and some people that are not informed as much as 
they should be, frequently harder for civilian

27:27.402 --> 27:34.472
review boards for police departments. That is a 
real sore point with most departments because

27:34.492 --> 27:57.105
concerning most police activities, they can't 
even be explained to,

27:34.492 --> 27:57.105
much less understood by, so many of the civilian 
population. And

27:58.098 --> 28:25.185
if the Civilian Review Board

27:58.098 --> 28:25.185
was appointed by somebody who didn't care for the 
police department to begin with or who responded

27:58.098 --> 28:25.185
to politics more than actual circumstances, 
There could be a very definite drawback or

28:26.161 --> 28:37.052
detriment to

28:26.161 --> 28:37.052
any department. By the internal affairs group 
being able to, or with the understanding of,

28:37.072 --> 28:53.147
making the full, thorough, complete 
investigation and making no recommendations,

28:54.562 --> 29:08.862
turning it over to somebody else for that, it 
counteracts the, gives a good argument that we

28:54.562 --> 29:08.862
don't need a civilian review board. We've got a 
group of people here that will make a complete

29:09.803 --> 29:17.954
thorough investigation and give you the results 
of it. Now, then it's up to you to decide what to do

29:17.974 --> 29:19.877
next. But we don't need anyone else 
investigating. We'll make the investigation.

29:24.409 --> 29:25.270
And we'll make it third. At the time I was in there, 
which was several years ago,

29:26.952 --> 29:43.211
I read figures that the average internal affairs 
investigation cost $5,000.

29:45.594 --> 29:48.417
I wouldn't doubt it. That or probably more. And 
it's certainly gone up since then. Because it is a

29:54.205 --> 29:56.909
girl. As complete as I can make it. What else?

30:10.985 --> 30:11.225
OK. There was a period there where a lot of people 
were crying out about police brutality this and

30:12.647 --> 30:17.893
police brutality that.

30:21.367 --> 30:25.835
Do you think Peachtree County really ever was 
anything more than an isolated incident or two?

30:28.659 --> 30:33.768
As a practice note, it was not an isolated 
incident. Sure, you're going to have it. You're

30:36.633 --> 30:38.256
going to have it in any business you're in. If 
you've got a department with a thousand men.

30:45.668 --> 30:47.391
To give you the classic example,

30:51.758 --> 30:58.412
You're taught in school to treat

30:51.758 --> 30:58.412
everybody alike. The first thing you learn when 
you get out working is that you can't treat

31:00.516 --> 31:07.551
everybody alike. They don't expect you to and 
don't want you to. Another is...
