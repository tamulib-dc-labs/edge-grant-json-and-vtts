00:01.718 --> 00:04.742
I came out of this program in 71. I think many of us 
did that were more generalist. I think there's

00:09.890 --> 00:12.053
some positives and negatives on that. I think many 
times you're so general that people don't think

00:12.173 --> 00:17.020
you can really do functional planning. My whole 
life has been saying if you know how to plan, you can

00:18.062 --> 00:23.971
plan for anything, no matter what. And you can do 
comprehensive planning. You can deal with

00:26.795 --> 00:29.058
strategic planning issues. You can deal with 
functional issues. And you can become an expert in

00:31.655 --> 00:36.202
health planning. I don't know where the future is 
in this whole business. I'm just around so many

00:41.209 --> 00:50.403
people that planning is so foreign that you have to 
sell your wares for other things. You have to sell

00:50.443 --> 00:57.093
on, you know, like I'm in policy development. 
Every action that I get the governor to act upon

01:01.945 --> 01:04.188
It's a little planning document. I gather facts. I 
do the analytical work necessary to sift those

01:05.931 --> 01:25.880
out, determine what the real facts are, so to 
speak, and develop kind of an issues development,

01:05.931 --> 01:25.880
and then try to lay out the options and say, 
Governor, this is what you ought to do. So that's

01:25.900 --> 01:27.683
what I'm doing. Never is it called planning. But 
that's what we're involved in.

01:37.457 --> 01:38.058
What about state? Does state planning have any 
appeal to you at all? State level stuff? None? Not

01:43.806 --> 01:45.308
at all yet. I think they're interested in private 
sector. Well, we haven't known anybody to talk to

01:47.571 --> 01:51.897
us about state planning. We don't know anything 
about state planning. It's very seldom discussed

01:55.361 --> 01:57.484
in the department. understanding regional 
planning is really not discussed anymore. It's

02:02.111 --> 02:12.505
kind of funny that regional planning, again, I've 
worked with it off and on for my whole career. Bye

02:14.668 --> 02:15.128
bye. I'm sorry you're leaving. Take care.

02:20.835 --> 02:22.938
I'm really sold on regional planning. And I guess I 
am because I just know there's so many issues that

02:26.523 --> 02:32.850
can't be dealt with at the state level, so many 
issues that can't be dealt with the city level. And

02:33.591 --> 02:40.820
our counties are just, you know, if you had 
counties like California, then you don't need

02:33.591 --> 02:40.820
regional planning, probably. You have highly 
capable, strong planning and program staff

02:41.861 --> 02:50.691
within the county level. And so, you know, the 
necessity for regional planning probably is

02:51.380 --> 02:56.268
maybe less. I don't know. But in Texas, we have 
nothing at the county level, fairly strong

02:57.290 --> 03:06.826
activities going on, particularly urban cities, 
big cities. But in rural towns, no program staff.

03:13.300 --> 03:22.691
And then the state level is really weak on planning 
and issue development. So regional planning is a

03:22.711 --> 03:34.545
real good function to try to pull together city, 
county issues and be a link between the state of

03:22.711 --> 03:34.545
Texas. Leon, what do you think the chances are of 
having a new state planning law written or a state

03:43.962 --> 03:48.247
planning law written that would mandate certain 
actions by the state? I think it's interesting.

03:54.874 --> 04:02.422
Let me mention, I don't know how to tell you, but 
look at the second actual page on that task force.

04:03.323 --> 04:09.970
The second page, if you look at the front of the 
document and just look at the actual last

04:10.625 --> 04:12.148
LegalLink page. The last one on that page is 
Special Committee on Organization of State

04:12.830 --> 04:16.838
Agencies. Here. Too bad they didn't number the 
pages. Thank

04:24.213 --> 04:28.903
you. Let me just bring this to your attention, 
because we're looking at how we could opt to

04:31.482 --> 04:39.850
restructure state government with this with this 
group. My director is on this, this group and the

04:39.870 --> 04:48.118
governor appointed the chairman. So we're gonna 
try to influence this this group, although their

04:48.138 --> 05:00.510
appointees from lieutenant governor and speaker 
on

04:48.138 --> 05:00.510
this whole issue of how we reorganize. We got into 
this whole discussion of super agencies, trying

05:04.185 --> 05:30.193
to instead of having 300 and some odd state 
agencies, try to have 18 super agencies with

05:04.185 --> 05:30.193
breakouts, maybe departments, maybe an 
environmental agency with air, water, whatnot

05:04.185 --> 05:30.193
under it, rather than having the independent 
little small agencies. A

05:30.967 --> 05:43.707
number of people have testified that many states 
have gone away from the umbrella type agency

05:30.967 --> 05:43.707
because of numerous problems. The umbrella 
agency concept was supposed to be big in the late

05:43.807 --> 05:49.836
70s. There are a number of states that did 
reorganization of state government and did the

05:50.077 --> 05:55.665
umbrella agency concept. In fact, Jimmy Cotta 
which was one of the earlier ones that reorganized

05:59.047 --> 06:09.239
Georgia and

05:59.047 --> 06:09.239
did that lumping of agencies. But we've had a 
number of people testify that rather than that, we

06:09.599 --> 06:27.079
needed to really emphasize the governor forming 
these

06:09.599 --> 06:27.079
planning commissions of agency heads, which the 
governor can do now. But, I mean, they're saying

06:27.447 --> 06:29.089
mandate it. They're saying mandate reports at a 
certain time, mandate action, which is really the

06:29.530 --> 06:40.845
only way you'd probably appropriate dollars for 
it and so forth. And what I'm saying is that would

06:41.206 --> 06:48.696
exactly be, I don't know that you'd call it a 
planning agency particularly, but it would be...

06:49.148 --> 07:01.166
You know, time might be right for a piece of 
legislation that would require these kinds of

06:49.148 --> 07:01.166
planning functions.

07:01.186 --> 07:08.798
Well, usually in an era of trouble, economic 
trouble, people are searching for answers of some

07:01.186 --> 07:08.798
type.

07:11.762 --> 07:14.987
So what you could do is work with your students and 
come up with a strategy and over there at the

07:15.608 --> 07:18.491
appropriate time. Exactly. Since they're all 
interested in city government, they don't care

07:22.135 --> 07:26.920
about mending state government? Well, if we were, 
if Texas A&M were in Austin, I think that we'd have

07:26.940 --> 07:34.888
something of a different orientation towards 
state government in this department. I don't

07:35.869 --> 07:37.231
think so. We really don't get over there that 
often. You see, the planning department in the

07:39.553 --> 07:43.978
University of Texas doesn't see any... We don't 
see them. That's them.

07:49.468 --> 07:52.554
They're different. They've always been 
different. Yes, ma'am. I think that the reason I'm

07:54.819 --> 08:03.616
not interested as much in it as a career, I'm 
interested

07:54.819 --> 08:03.616
in it as a career. I want to work more with the 
teachers. at the state level, because that means

08:06.166 --> 08:16.496
you don't feel like you're really working with 
people, you feel like you're working with a whole

08:06.166 --> 08:16.496
regional plan. It's very necessary. I just wonder 
if you don't think you're attacking that, but it's

08:16.957 --> 08:22.322
just, I want to work more with the grassroots and 
the people. Where the action is. Yeah, I want to see

08:25.125 --> 08:35.515
results, and I don't think that you will 
eventually, but I think it's slower moving at that

08:25.125 --> 08:35.515
level, because it hasn't been tested, and that's 
why we're in trouble. Maintain good health so you

08:36.153 --> 08:39.958
live long enough to see the results of your work. 
I'll try. You can try. With the size of

08:47.329 --> 08:56.162
your staff, what is the background of people 
coming in from public administration? Or are they

08:56.182 --> 08:59.026
trained planners? I was the first planner that had 
a degree in it, hired in the governor's office.

09:07.135 --> 09:09.738
Ralph, you know, is an example. I

09:10.019 --> 09:21.813
think it's a mixed bag now and now with budget 
planning being merged and heavy on the budget.

09:21.853 --> 09:31.765
Most of their focus is like LBJ directors, the 
public administration.

09:31.786 --> 09:36.231
You know, but I think state government in general, 
they're different planning shops there. But I'm

09:36.920 --> 09:41.826
not trying to sell you. I would say that any job that 
you have, you need to understand about the state

09:41.986 --> 09:51.197
level, how to deal with them, how to manipulate 
them or whatnot. I would probably counter a little

09:52.599 --> 09:54.041
bit. I think we probably see quite a few people, 
bodies in our office wanting issues to be dealt

09:54.101 --> 10:06.015
with similar to a city planning office. I will say 
this. Y'all may not see this a lot, but we have

10:09.646 --> 10:19.859
public broadcasting on our table, the network, 
and there's a lot of city stuff, you know, played

10:09.646 --> 10:19.859
late at night. And particularly at the county 
level, every decision that's made is made open to

10:19.879 --> 10:26.227
the world. Every decision that's made. I saw the 
other night a consultant being selected, and the

10:29.571 --> 10:35.378
consultants were drug out before the commission 
in the county commission and they testified

10:35.560 --> 10:57.366
before the commission and body of people in the 
background and everybody watching on TV and they

10:35.560 --> 10:57.366
were saying why why don't you think we all select 
you you know what's wrong with those guys next to

10:35.560 --> 10:57.366
you I mean it was a much more open process than state 
government And I don't know, I guess it's better,

10:58.173 --> 11:03.080
but gee, that's something that's not done at that 
state level. I mean, you would have consultants in

11:03.721 --> 11:17.981
independently to discuss their piece and then 
excuse them and get the next guy in, you know, that

11:03.721 --> 11:17.981
kind of thing, rather than having them right there 
before the world. Leon, looking at this map of the

11:19.583 --> 11:26.172
Texas planning regions, which are distributed 
The quality of performance by the various cogs in

11:27.063 --> 11:35.531
the state is very uneven. We have one locally that 4 
o'clock y'all have to be by. I enjoyed coming. And

11:46.322 --> 11:49.605
don't give up on the state, OK? Yeah, see you. If 
y'all need to run, don't feel compelled to stay. It

11:54.269 --> 11:56.091
was good to be here with you. Yes. The quality of the 
work of the local COG is non-planning, shall we

11:58.623 --> 12:04.389
say. What can be done about a job description in 
terms of sort of a possible mandating of certain

12:06.452 --> 12:19.446
levels of planning by the various COGs around the 
state? Is there any hope for that sort of thing to

12:19.686 --> 12:25.032
happen that would give them a mission? Well, it's 
real difficult to, even when we were funding them

12:26.547 --> 12:38.199
very extensively, it's difficult to mandate. The 
whole philosophy of regional councils were that

12:38.299 --> 12:46.908
they were to provide local elected officials come 
together and form entities. Obviously, there are

12:47.148 --> 12:51.913
certain things they have to do in order to get their 
federal and state funds. But they are locally

12:52.433 --> 12:59.120
operated and owned, and there's always a point 
where the elected officials say, we ain't doing

12:52.433 --> 12:59.120
that. And there's always that fine line. I think 
the answer would be, yes, there ought to be more

13:02.764 --> 13:07.930
specific criteria given them. The money is being 
cut back. State level money is being cut back. Now

13:13.896 --> 13:21.765
we're in a reduction mode rather than increasing 
mode, even with costs rising.

13:22.589 --> 13:31.402
Our ability to really mandate those things might 
be limited by the fact that we just don't give them

13:22.589 --> 13:31.402
that much money. But the unevenness all comes from 
the fact that the money, like the smaller cogs will

13:31.422 --> 13:42.819
get like $50,000 from the state. And be a planning 
director and get $50,000 and say, you just go out

13:43.661 --> 13:51.853
and do all the planning you want to do for $50,000. 
Of course, they job around and get their other

13:52.053 --> 13:57.120
federal and state dollars to try to keep the doors 
open. But they don't have the discretionary money

13:57.901 --> 14:01.186
to do. I mean, they've got to run the aging program, 
and they've got to run the job training program,

14:01.206 --> 14:12.842
and they've got to do the criminal justice stuff 
where they're distributing funds for crime

14:01.206 --> 14:12.842
fighting. This is my complaint about them is that 
they're doing service-oriented programs.

14:20.232 --> 14:21.334
They're not doing planning. It's a service 
operation now. That is where they've had to go. The

14:28.298 --> 14:34.183
701 HUD money was the glue money, as well as the 
state dollars. And then there were several other

14:34.924 --> 14:39.168
generalist pots of money, and those are gone. 
Another question I keep asking, why is it that

14:40.469 --> 14:50.578
Oregon, Florida, and California can get away with 
mandating planning, statewide planning, when,

14:50.980 --> 14:54.024
for example, Oregon is hardly a wealthy state. But 
they require it of every county and every city in

14:54.905 --> 14:58.369
the state. And they've all done it.

15:06.200 --> 15:14.150
I would probably say if you look at the revenue 
stream for those cities and counties, you will

15:06.200 --> 15:14.150
find that all those dollars come from the state. 
Whereas our city and county governments operate

15:15.091 --> 15:19.857
off of... ad valorem taxes. So their money, I mean, 
they're allowed to do the ad valorem taxes by the

15:22.880 --> 15:30.452
state of Texas, but they don't have to ask for the 
money. The money is theirs because they provide

15:30.872 --> 15:36.121
that taxation. I don't know that that is totally 
the case, but I think that Oregonians, in this

15:36.682 --> 15:46.958
case, do try to exercise a great deal of equity. so 
that if state government does mandate something,

15:47.242 --> 15:56.515
I think that state government feels a 
responsibility for funding the opportunity to

15:47.242 --> 15:56.515
fulfill the mandate. Yeah, that's probably true. 
I think, I was just thinking about New Mexico. All

16:00.962 --> 16:10.435
the revenue is brought up to the state level, and 
then they spew it back to the cities and counties

16:00.962 --> 16:10.435
based on, you know, a funding, you know, deal. And 
they, you know, I don't know exactly how they

16:10.455 --> 16:15.042
distribute it, but that, you know, it makes a lot of 
difference. They will give you these tax dollars

16:16.283 --> 16:20.447
if you will do these things. And I guess, for the 
record or anybody else, city and county

16:21.688 --> 16:40.385
government associations, that's a major 
complaint with them, that state government tends

16:21.688 --> 16:40.385
to lay mandates on city and county and other 
entities without the appropriate resources to

16:21.688 --> 16:40.385
get it done. And to some extent, that's true in 
state government. Of course, the feds have done

16:43.668 --> 16:45.430
that, too. Oh, sure. It trickles down through the 
beds. I had

16:51.232 --> 17:06.253
a quick question for you, and I guess a statement 
coming back to one of your questions and the

16:51.232 --> 17:06.253
interest of why people aren't interested in 
estate planning. In my situation, I'm interested

17:06.273 --> 17:12.362
in urban design, and does the state at any level 
offer that? to a planter coming out of school,

17:12.950 --> 17:15.973
urban design. What do you mean by that? Well, do 
they use... I mean, what... I know the city uses,

17:20.158 --> 17:24.022
like, an urban designer, but... When you say urban 
design, what do you mean? What kind of thing would

17:27.106 --> 17:30.870
you envision designing? More or less like a dart 
and so on, train stations,

17:31.931 --> 17:40.881
cityscape and so on. Well, that's obviously going 
to have to be a city. Yeah, that's obviously going

17:44.686 --> 17:47.149
to have to be a city. But when you said urban design, 
the transportation planning function within the

17:48.030 --> 18:05.452
highway department, for example, has a heck of a 
lot to do with what goes on within a city, a city of

17:48.030 --> 18:05.452
Houston or Dallas or whatever else, although a lot 
of that's done locally. But the freeway systems

18:06.133 --> 18:11.239
and all that kind of stuff has a lot to do with that. 
But I think, yeah, I think your urban design is

18:11.759 --> 18:18.390
primarily done by the urban areas, urban cities. 
And in my case, I didn't think the state would have

18:18.931 --> 18:22.957
that. No, I think your interest, you'd be better 
served in the larger urban areas. It's kind of

18:31.170 --> 18:35.337
interesting because I'm, you know, quite 
frankly, I'm not sure just how much... urban

18:36.177 --> 18:40.101
design is done within Dallas and Houston and San 
Antonio. Well, I'm not either. I was going to

18:41.483 --> 18:47.490
mention that during the break between semesters I 
spent in Switzerland. And there you have a country

18:47.510 --> 18:52.756
that just reeks of urban design. And it's all 
consistent within the entire country. The

18:56.720 --> 19:02.467
bridges are all, they're just pure works of art. 
And they use minimal materials. and a maximum of

19:05.557 --> 19:13.905
thoughtful engineering design, rather than the 
reverse that we do in this country. And all the

19:15.146 --> 19:18.689
signing and so forth is very carefully studied. 
And the placement of outdoor advertising, they

19:18.709 --> 19:21.632
have a lot of it. But it's done in a way that it's not 
visually disruptive. And it can be done. I don't

19:32.421 --> 19:35.344
think that simply because it's a state that it is 
impossible, even a large state like Texas,

19:35.611 --> 19:43.639
because there we're dealing with a whole country 
composed of, in their case, cantons. They have a

19:43.680 --> 19:47.283
central planning agency for the federal 
government. They do, out of Barron. And all things

19:49.706 --> 19:52.589
are planned out of that office? And they have a 
national plan.

19:59.336 --> 20:03.981
They put all of their resources in those kinds of 
things rather than military spending? They put a

20:04.703 --> 20:07.006
lot of money into military spending. That's the 
reason that they stayed neutral during the Second

20:07.707 --> 20:11.332
World War. Every... They don't spend that many 
dollars in their... Percentage-wise, it's very

20:13.835 --> 20:19.603
high. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. In all of those 
mountains, you have artillery, and they're

20:21.225 --> 20:27.153
pointed in all sorts of directions, namely in 
Germany. Oh. Yeah. And they come up hydraulically

20:30.076 --> 20:32.019
out of the ground. They look like farmers... hay, 
drying, pots, and so forth. But it's all

20:37.723 --> 20:41.186
camouflage. In the Department of Commerce 
packet, it talks about how the commission should

20:41.206 --> 20:53.137
look at, or how they should look at other states' 
plans. Is that something that is done a lot? Is it

20:55.078 --> 20:57.100
keeping up with what other states are up to? It's 
kind of interesting. On this consolidation task

20:59.863 --> 21:02.605
force, Yes, the Consolidation Task Force.

21:09.923 --> 21:12.727
Every agency, they call the agencies in. Every 
agency is telling them what they do and so forth. It

21:16.132 --> 21:21.520
seemed like the question always got around, well, 
how do other states do what you bid? And it's kind of

21:22.321 --> 21:25.005
funny that it's gotten where now. That's the first 
question asked. How do you compare? How do we rank

21:28.090 --> 21:29.652
with other states? How do we, you know... And we 
always rank low in terms of state spending per

21:32.369 --> 21:39.640
capita or whatnot. That's a fairly new attitude in 
state government. Oh, it is. Most of the time, we

21:44.829 --> 21:48.995
were proud of underspending. And still, I'm not 
sure we're away from that. Well, the point I'm

21:52.521 --> 22:00.233
making, too, is that it was almost forbidden to 
mention experience gained from other states

22:00.753 --> 22:24.853
texas had its own way of doing things and you could 
not compare with other states because they all did

22:00.753 --> 22:24.853
it wrong well they all did it wrong for texas i'm 
sorry yes yeah well you met uh in the strategic

22:00.753 --> 22:24.853
economic policy commission the mission one of the 
mission is to lead the development of a

22:00.753 --> 22:24.853
comprehensive plan for the state which will 
provide both long-term direction and placing

22:25.154 --> 22:29.701
priority on other short-term actions to improve 
the state's economy. Considering the, what,

22:30.602 --> 22:37.372
because this was established in 19, I don't know 
when it was. Well, the regions were actually

22:37.392 --> 22:42.479
delineated in 68, the study was done, yeah. But 
considering the 1968 delineation, we have about

22:42.759 --> 22:48.728
24 regions. How do you reconcile the objectives or 
goals of these 24 different counties into one

22:53.858 --> 22:55.820
state objective?

22:59.824 --> 23:03.127
Well, I'm not sure what the strategy is going to be 
of the commission. I know the COGS, the regional

23:04.088 --> 23:14.719
councils, we call them COGS sometimes, regional 
councils are offering to feed in to this

23:04.088 --> 23:14.719
commission. They've already met a couple of 
times, and they're offering to provide forums at

23:15.279 --> 23:22.887
the 24 regional levels. provide free space and all 
this kind of stuff to to help you know with this

23:23.423 --> 23:52.536
input into the to the plan I'm sure they'll 
probably play a role I'm not sure how much quite

23:23.423 --> 23:52.536
frankly Commerce if it has a weakness right now is 
recording it has a weakness right now it's heavily

23:23.423 --> 23:52.536
weighted toward businessmen and it doesn't 
really have much of a governmental slant. So I'm

23:56.647 --> 23:59.631
not sure how that will all play out. But all the 
government appointees are

23:59.671 --> 24:08.443
businessmen-oriented, focused. So I'm not real 
sure how comfortable the department's going to be

24:08.483 --> 24:15.913
working with regional entities. But I think you 
make a good point. I think the reasons certainly

24:17.655 --> 24:22.962
would be, even though, as Bob says, they're 
probably not particularly good are doing much

24:23.684 --> 24:27.808
planning now. They're probably as good as most 
folks out there that are doing planning. You start

24:34.155 --> 24:36.497
looking at other governmental entities. I could 
be proven wrong within some of the major urban

24:38.359 --> 24:46.728
areas, but you go to Podunk, a little town, and 
they're zoning. They throw in zoning ordinances

24:46.748 --> 24:53.235
and stuff, but there's really not much planning 
involved. But I appreciate your comment or your

24:53.722 --> 25:00.470
question. We're going to be encouraging that from 
our office. We're going to be encouraging the use

25:05.616 --> 25:11.963
of regional council in that process. I would 
certainly like to see a job description at least

25:11.983 --> 25:21.214
suggested by state government for COGS in terms of 
what would be nice to see them do in terms of

25:21.548 --> 25:24.331
planning? It could start out being suggested. You 
don't see their law. You see their law lately? The

25:31.159 --> 25:37.366
law has some pretty heavy statements about what 
they should do. If you'll get the last directory,

25:37.446 --> 25:44.874
look at the back at the Article 1011M, I would be 
surprised if you wouldn't think that sounds

25:37.446 --> 25:44.874
pretty, pretty good. But someone's going to have 
to say, you see the law? Do it. and here's some money

25:50.287 --> 25:54.194
that you can get it done with. It sounds pretty 
comprehensive planning-oriented, involving

25:54.214 --> 26:02.951
all the functional planning components and so 
forth. I'll have to take a look. You might look at

26:03.793 --> 26:05.075
it. Thank you all. Appreciate it. Thank you very 
much, Leon. Yes. Thank you.
