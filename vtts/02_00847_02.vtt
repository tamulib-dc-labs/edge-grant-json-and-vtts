00:01.685 --> 00:30.747
a paper

00:01.685 --> 00:30.747
there

00:01.685 --> 00:30.747
oh i'll tell you now that thing's not on there is it 
yes is it yeah keep talking that's fine i didn't

00:01.685 --> 00:30.747
know it was still on i think that that times would 
get better i may be optimistic about this but I

00:31.030 --> 00:39.702
think they will, and I think that people are going 
to get paid better for their jobs, for whatever

00:31.030 --> 00:39.702
they do. It'll be. Now, just like now with 
babysitting, people get somebody to babysit

00:43.247 --> 00:52.921
farm, and they just give them whatever they want 
to. Well, now this law has gone into effect.

00:56.065 --> 00:59.350
They've got to pay $2.30 an hour.

01:01.085 --> 01:11.519
And because Karen babysits a lot, and she could 
babysit more, but I won't let her babysit for just

01:01.085 --> 01:11.519
anybody. It's got to be somebody I know. And 
sometimes they'll bring them here because she

01:14.063 --> 01:23.316
just babysits at night because she can't babysit 
in daytime because she's going to school. Of

01:23.856 --> 01:30.045
course, she keeps this child, and then she works 
for an insurance company for the farm insurance

01:30.363 --> 01:34.348
man on Saturday. She makes as much on Saturday, and 
she goes to work at 9, and she's never worked past 1

01:34.368 --> 01:43.419
o'clock, and he gives her $15. And this woman that 
she keeps, this little girl, she pays her about $18

01:43.619 --> 01:54.813
or $20 a week, and she can work down there that 
little time. That's the difference in people. Of

01:58.325 --> 02:00.707
course, Karen told her what she'd work for. And I 
shouldn't have let her done it, but she did. And of

02:06.773 --> 02:09.215
course, now school will soon be out. She's going to 
try to get a job over at A&M.

02:14.861 --> 02:17.603
You were talking about the minimum wage. Do you 
think that other federal controls are more strict

02:17.964 --> 02:23.229
now than they used to be in the past? Oh, yes. 
Definitely.

02:28.143 --> 02:30.726
What did they regulate, if anything? What? What 
kind of things did they use to regulate? Well, just

02:34.971 --> 02:38.075
who it was. Say this way. Suppose I want, just like 
this woman that I've got working for me, suppose

02:40.058 --> 02:51.211
I'd want somebody to work for me, and I'd say, I'll 
give you $6 this week to work for me. And maybe

02:52.072 --> 02:56.698
somebody over here, they'd tell somebody, I'll 
give you $3 to come. That's no regulation. And it

03:00.521 --> 03:09.211
was the same way with any kind of business or 
anything, just whatever the individual, and

03:00.521 --> 03:09.211
especially on ranches. One would pay one thing and 
another another, and they'd say, well, I've got a

03:11.593 --> 03:15.677
job. I'm not going to give up my job thinking I can go 
over there and maybe I'll get cut off. And now it's

03:20.643 --> 03:25.588
regulated what they've got to do. They've got to 
pay a minimum wage now. I don't care what it is. Do

03:30.185 --> 03:31.187
you think that's better? Sure, it's better. Look, 
two years ago, in the stores here, you know what

03:34.431 --> 03:40.139
they paid? $1.75 an hour to stand on their feet all 
day long, eight hours. Well, now they've got to pay

03:49.071 --> 03:53.837
that minimum wage. And don't you think it's 
better? Yes, I do. I think it is. Well, now, all

03:59.959 --> 04:05.305
right, if you say this way, all right, I've got a big 
farm out here. Now, you come out here, Gary, and

04:05.345 --> 04:10.731
I'll give you $1.75 an hour to work all day. All 
right, somebody over here, they'll say, well,

04:11.272 --> 04:14.836
I'll give you $2.30. Well, you see, there's no 
regularity. There's no system to that. That's

04:20.442 --> 04:25.528
just gee-haw about where you'd say, well, I've got 
this job, and I don't want to quit it. Because I go

04:25.880 --> 04:29.444
over here and I know I can work on him. Oh, yes. It's 
definitely better. Well, what do you think about

04:35.170 --> 04:41.616
the way they're trying to control the economy with 
the wage and, I mean, with the price controls? Do

04:42.417 --> 04:50.345
you think they should keep up the price controls 
that they've been enforcing upon certain goods?

04:51.827 --> 04:55.110
Well, I'll tell you. That's kind of a hard 
question, but it's this way. I think it depends

04:59.941 --> 05:03.687
largely on what that it is. I think that farmers, I 
don't think there ought to be anything controlled

05:06.011 --> 05:13.042
with what they have worked for. It costs a lot to 
raise cattle. It costs a lot to raise feed. And I

05:18.951 --> 05:22.937
think they ought to be allowed to sell it for what 
they can get for it. that there's a lot of

05:24.706 --> 05:53.295
government control now on uh you know what what 
farmers can grow sometimes the government will

05:24.706 --> 05:53.295
pay them not to grow something you know you think 
they ought to do that i think the farmers ought to

05:24.706 --> 05:53.295
just grow whatever they want i think they'll be 
allowed to grow whatever they want to grow and as

05:24.706 --> 05:53.295
much of it as they want to i think that's one thing 
that has made stuff so high

05:24.706 --> 05:53.295
it's a control on things now uh we have a good friend 
italian she's one of karen's best friends linda

05:54.085 --> 06:19.789
did you he owns land and lined in the bottom last 
year it went to raining and all the cotton in the

05:54.085 --> 06:19.789
bottom was lost he lost eighty thousand dollars 
well they claim i heard today that because last

05:54.085 --> 06:19.789
year cotton was a failure And it's going to make 
stuff grow up. Well, they didn't have so much

06:22.688 --> 06:24.990
cotton. They just allowed so much. Well, this 
year, he said he wasn't going to raise no cotton

06:27.293 --> 06:34.200
because he had that bad luck last year. Well, now 
they come out and told him that he would have to

06:34.681 --> 06:42.649
raise cotton, or he couldn't raise cotton no more 
until this. Maybe someday he could. And so Linda

06:46.060 --> 06:51.965
was here yesterday, and I never asked her what her 
daddy had decided to do. Now that is, I call that

06:52.888 --> 06:56.644
dictatorship.
