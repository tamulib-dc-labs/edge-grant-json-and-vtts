WEBVTT

00:01.840 --> 00:11.280
12, 1980, and Tommy Suarez of 5010 Oak Shadows is 
here, and he's listening to everything that's

00:01.840 --> 00:11.280
been said. Have you in any way been coerced into 
saying anything, or are you saying this

00:11.780 --> 00:19.910
completely on your own? It's my own free will, and 
it's my firm belief, and have been since the day of

00:20.750 --> 00:29.840
the assassination in 1963. Okay. We can keep 
going. You

00:33.960 --> 00:48.370
were telling me yesterday that, and I can't 
remember because when I went back to the house, I

00:33.960 --> 00:48.370
wrote some notes down, but I couldn't remember 
all. There was something that you had said that had

00:48.690 --> 00:55.690
been deleted from the Warren Commission and all 
the other investigations.

00:59.500 --> 01:06.410
The bulk of that investigation has been sealed. 
And

01:06.410 --> 01:17.430
I believe a period of time was set at 80 years before 
it would ever be opened and displayed to the

01:06.410 --> 01:17.430
public. And

01:17.410 --> 01:39.890
if you can believe what you see on television and 
read in the news, hear on radio, certain

01:17.410 --> 01:39.890
individuals who

01:17.410 --> 01:39.890
believe there was more than one gunman involved, 
and who have played back. We have recorded

01:45.820 --> 02:21.200
portions of the incident, some of which were 
supposed to have been recorded at Dallas Police

01:45.820 --> 02:21.200
Headquarters and their dispatching mechanism 
put on tape because of a mobile unit's microphone

01:45.820 --> 02:21.200
on the motorcycle of one of the Dallas police 
officers who was riding escort. There was, what

02:23.610 --> 02:54.600
were shots fired and had been stipulated in the 
various reports, and that some witnesses have

02:23.610 --> 02:54.600
claimed that there was a

02:23.610 --> 02:54.600
visual evidence to them of additional gunfire 
from a knoll long near the book storage building. I

02:54.580 --> 03:00.360
believe this knoll would have been a little bit 
southwest of the... southwest corner of the

03:00.380 --> 03:03.990
building. And would have been northwest of the, 
uh, path of the automobile the President and Vice

03:03.970 --> 03:14.920
President were riding in. I

03:14.900 --> 03:30.520
was watching this motorcade proceed through 
Dallas television live the time the

03:14.900 --> 03:30.520
assassination occurred. But,

03:30.500 --> 03:39.490
uh, through that media I was not able to hear 
anything that I could discover. Thank you, sir.

03:41.590 --> 03:54.860
However,

03:41.590 --> 03:54.860
in the transfer from the Dallas Police Station to 
the Dallas County Jail, which was attempted on

03:54.840 --> 04:01.690
Sunday morning, once again I was watching that 
live on television, and I did hear the report of

04:01.670 --> 04:13.880
firearms or a reasonable facsimile thereof at the 
incident that Jack Rudy

04:13.860 --> 04:28.630
surged towards Lee Harvey Oswald, and Oswald 
folded over and grasped his midriff, and then

04:28.610 --> 04:39.770
reportedly died,

04:28.610 --> 04:39.770
practically in the arms of a police captain. And I 
did distinctly hear that police captain say,

04:45.240 --> 04:53.090
Jack, you son of a bitch, to Jack Rudy. Is it common 
procedure for, for, when they're escorting

04:56.070 --> 05:02.090
somebody, for, for a policeman not to be in front of 
the person that they're escorting out? Proper

05:05.860 --> 05:17.250
procedure for a police officer or anybody else to 
escort a prisoner, party that has control of the

05:17.230 --> 05:27.650
prisoner, walks behind the prisoner.

05:27.630 --> 05:34.950
In this kind of situation that's transpired 
there, there was numerous police officers of all

05:34.930 --> 05:35.951
categories. All around, Lee Harvey

05:35.930 --> 05:45.090
Oswald. Had it not been for the familiar sight of 
Jack Rudy around the Dallas Police Station over

05:51.800 --> 05:59.140
the period of a couple of three months prior to this 
occurrence, Rudy would never have been able to

05:59.120 --> 06:09.920
even gotten on the grounds.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.920
Yeah, I see, I see that. But, and my question is, do 
you consider it to have been proper procedure the

06:11.900 --> 06:17.920
way that they were escorting him out? Nothing 
wrong with the procedure that they were using to

06:19.900 --> 06:23.920
escort him. Their belief was that everybody had 
been okay to be there and screened, and were not any

06:27.900 --> 06:33.100
threat to the life of the prisoner at all. He was 
being properly escorted with the captain of the

06:33.080 --> 06:40.780
police

06:33.080 --> 06:40.780
on one side of him and the, some other police 
official on the other side, a commissioned peace

06:40.760 --> 06:49.110
officer. And they each had ahold of an arm. That 
captain had a hold of Oswald's right arm and some

06:52.760 --> 06:59.780
other individual had his left arm and they were 
walking the captain just to his, barely to his

06:59.760 --> 07:06.570
right rear, almost the rest of him and the other 
officer in a similar position on the left side. It

07:11.860 --> 07:21.580
wasn't a matter of not having sufficient numbers 
of security operating in a firm belief that they

07:21.560 --> 07:25.580
had screened everybody and that there was nobody 
that would be any threat to the prisoner

07:25.560 --> 07:34.100
present. I can't fault the, the Dallas Police 
Department on this thing at all,

07:34.080 --> 07:49.450
but insofar as their methods they were using to 
transport him, that I would be somewhat tempted to

07:49.430 --> 07:59.230
criticize the news media because

07:59.210 --> 08:07.370
in the book that the chief police at that time, the 
Dallas Police wrote on the subject, he was

08:07.350 --> 08:19.780
somewhat coerced by the news media,

08:07.350 --> 08:19.780
which can unseat just about any individual from 
any public office that they decide to, including

08:19.760 --> 08:25.660
any president in the United States. With such 
action, if he didn't have this thing in the daytime

08:27.640 --> 08:34.810
where the majority of people would be able to watch 
it going on on television, live, at the burst of

08:34.790 --> 08:42.880
between two and four o'clock a.m. when 
practically everybody would be in bed asleep and

08:42.860 --> 08:48.900
nobody much would be watching it live on 
television. As a matter of fact, at that time, the

08:50.880 --> 08:59.360
local television stations here didn't even 
operate at that time of the morning. They shut

09:01.340 --> 09:05.900
down. Some of them don't now. They leave the airs 
around one o'clock, one thirty. I don't think any

09:12.600 --> 09:18.730
of them stay all night and still have a shut-down 
period of sometimes a week or two. I don't think any

09:19.710 --> 09:20.731
of them do. Okay. Can you give me any information on 
this General Walker that you spoke of earlier? He

09:26.710 --> 09:31.730
was, after he had retired, he had become... He 
retired from where? From the military army. He

09:35.710 --> 09:47.650
retired, I believe, a major general and was very 
active in the field politics and the Democrat

09:47.630 --> 09:51.370
party. I don't even recall what his first name or 
initials was. But

09:55.350 --> 10:13.080
I refuse to concede the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald 
was a spy for the Soviet Union because a spy for the

10:13.060 --> 10:20.580
Soviet Union would not make a point to go and marry a 
Russian woman and bring her to live in Dallas,

10:20.560 --> 10:24.730
Texas. He tried to be a spy, give her a complete flop 
because she didn't have his cover blown before he

10:31.750 --> 10:32.771
ever started. He's no spy. I understand that. By 
what I understand, that's what you're saying.

10:38.960 --> 10:39.981
under that close of surveillance. I mean, he was in 
Dallas somewhere. We could undoubtedly find him.

10:41.960 --> 10:42.981
He'd probably be in a job. I don't know. I don't 
know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I

10:47.960 --> 10:48.981
don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't 
know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I

10:54.960 --> 10:58.220
don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't 
know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I

11:05.330 --> 11:06.351
don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't 
know. I don't know. I don't know. He was in Dallas

11:11.390 --> 11:12.411
somewhere. We could undoubtedly find him. 
Bonanza? Yeah. thing happened. They didn't? They

11:18.860 --> 11:19.550
did. Yeah. for he and his wife in Dallas. They had 
been living in Fort Worth, and the mother in Dallas

11:23.560 --> 11:29.580
was always in Dallas. Yeah. Yeah. and vice versa. 
He was keeping up with both

11:33.091 --> 11:37.260
homes. And while he was making all this round to 
Mexico City and back, he wasn't supposed to even

11:40.240 --> 11:43.500
have a job, period. No way in the time that anybody 
knew that at all. He was financing the living some

11:46.570 --> 11:50.320
kind of way. Of course, they claimed they checked 
this all out, and that he had sufficient funds

11:55.340 --> 11:58.360
coming in from some source. I never did know just 
where to have done this all. And it has never been

12:02.400 --> 12:07.600
clear in my mind what mode of transportation he 
used to get to Mexico City, if anybody ever

12:10.580 --> 12:12.600
mentioned that. He drove down there, walked, 
hitchhiked. How he got there? On a bus? He didn't go

12:18.810 --> 12:22.830
on a train, but he went across the river. And at 
Roma, if he had, there wasn't anything for a train

12:25.900 --> 12:28.920
to go to Roma about. Nothing there. He didn't even 
transport on a train. He wasn't going to produce

12:34.740 --> 12:37.770
anything. It was a rocky area around our little 
village there on the river. No

12:42.060 --> 12:49.250
city on the opposite side of Mexico was the window 
town or anything like that then. The nearest place

12:49.230 --> 12:54.270
after you got over there was San Pedro, and

12:54.250 --> 13:04.110
it was about the same size as Humber was. There's 
nothing to get to here. Humber's a pretty

13:07.090 --> 13:11.110
good-sized little town now, but it sure wouldn't 
be 1963. Uh... Will you, um... You said that you

13:16.090 --> 13:20.840
served in the service from the years of... Could 
you repeat that again? When I was in the military?

13:24.820 --> 13:31.180
From August the 7th, 1940 to July 28th, 1945. And 
what was your rank in the military? Highest rank in

13:34.160 --> 13:38.010
the health, and I was sergeant. I did attend the 
officer candidate school, and resigned out of it

13:40.990 --> 13:45.030
the day before I was to be commissioned. You

13:45.010 --> 13:51.020
said that you... You say that you know that, I don't 
know, that relations or something like that in

13:55.000 --> 13:59.020
Starr County? Did you know somebody who lived in 
Starr County, or...? I... While I was stationed

14:04.941 --> 14:10.110
there, the only somebody that I ever knew there, at 
that time,

14:10.090 --> 14:20.540
the city marshal there, a fellow by the name of 
Sanchez, he was in 1941. I was real well acquainted

14:22.520 --> 14:25.950
with him. I knew him, I talked to him a few times. I

14:28.930 --> 14:33.860
know a lot of people there. I know that the 
information has been that there was a great influx

14:34.890 --> 14:40.910
of, in recent years, a great influx of illegal 
drugs of various kinds, marijuana, I don't know,

14:47.010 --> 14:54.270
hashish, heroin, bag of tricks. It was coming 
through there, and some people built some law for

14:57.080 --> 15:01.100
pretty homes, at least that's what they showed to 
be on the television, I don't know, a place that

15:04.080 --> 15:07.180
didn't produce anything. They were buying homes 
out there, I don't know where they were getting

15:09.800 --> 15:13.420
their money from. Oil there, great shakes for 
grazing cattle, probably that area right along

15:18.440 --> 15:23.920
there where those homes were. Fifty acres might

15:23.900 --> 15:29.570
support a cattle, maybe. Of

15:29.550 --> 15:33.610
course, you never had it hard enough. In the 
winter, it was supported many times, supported to

15:35.590 --> 15:36.611
get around, but it takes so many acres to do it, and I 
doubt anybody had that many in that area. There's a

15:43.710 --> 15:48.730
lot of very fine homes built all along that road, 
between them for several miles, right up at the

15:50.710 --> 15:54.030
edge of Star County, towards Mission, which would 
be east of Reverend City. They showed these

15:58.130 --> 16:04.230
pictures and highway numbers and all this stuff 
right there, along the north of the road. There was

16:06.240 --> 16:08.260
a road where the, what do you call them, Skeet 
Specials railroad tracks ran south of the

16:08.240 --> 16:14.260
highway. These houses seemed to be on the north 
side of the road. There wasn't much of anything,

16:21.760 --> 16:26.950
and certainly nothing but brush from there back to 
the banks of the Rio Grande.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.980
Army posts there, four-wing roads, sat right on 
the banks of the Rio Grande. Okay. Can you tell me,

16:40.300 --> 16:42.320
from the time that you were there, since you 
started into your police career, as to where you

16:46.300 --> 16:49.760
have been, you have worked for, for what police, 
for what police agencies you have worked for? What

16:54.740 --> 16:56.760
police stations? Since you have retired, since 
you got out of the military, have you always been to

17:00.740 --> 17:03.760
the police force? Right. Can you tell me what 
police force? I was discharged on a Friday, July

17:09.790 --> 17:12.810
the 28th, 1945, Monday morning, and I went down and 
answered to an ad in the local paper and applied for

17:16.790 --> 17:20.810
a job at the Houston Police Department. And on the 
13th day of August, I was called to the station and

17:26.640 --> 17:28.660
sworn in as a police officer and given an 
assignment to work the VJ day for a... And

17:34.040 --> 17:40.620
so you have always said the police agency that you 
have always worked with has been HPD. Have you ever

17:44.980 --> 17:49.410
seen any material, any confidential material 
that has dealt with, with any Kennedy related

17:52.390 --> 17:58.360
material? Without divulging any, you know... Any 
written material or anything pertaining to this

18:05.840 --> 18:08.860
assassination? That is not, that's not public? We

18:10.840 --> 18:16.730
had nothing in our files. I had access to any files. 
We

18:18.710 --> 18:26.160
had nothing to investigate, to make any files. As

18:28.140 --> 18:31.680
far as I know, other than the possibility that he 
may have passed through some time, we don't

18:37.660 --> 18:39.680
believe on the possibility that he was ever in 
Houston. I

18:41.660 --> 18:45.420
don't agree with that. You said you... John 
Kennedy was here during that same period. He was

18:49.400 --> 18:51.420
here when they were campaigning for

18:51.400 --> 18:55.370
the presidency. And then he was here during that 
time, and Johnson was here after he was president.

19:01.790 --> 19:03.810
I went out to Hobby Air Force on St. Clark 
International Airport and was part of the police

19:05.790 --> 19:15.340
security out there. He and Lady Bird came down and 
Hugh Humphrey and his wife came with them. You have

19:24.070 --> 19:28.090
told me that LBJ was not in the same car with Kennedy 
or Connolly. No, Kennedy and Connolly was in the

19:34.070 --> 19:35.091
same car, but as the motorcade went by on 
television, there was the car they were in, and

19:43.990 --> 19:48.400
then the president lurched back like this in the 
seat, and it seemed like John Connolly lurched

19:54.170 --> 19:57.210
over this way about the same time and came down. And 
Jackie Kennedy crawled over the back seat and back

20:09.250 --> 20:12.260
on the trunk of the open top car, and seemed to be 
trying to do something for the president and the

20:22.400 --> 20:24.420
Secret Service. And running along behind, at 
least one of them climbed up on the trunk and

20:31.430 --> 20:36.930
somebody gave some kind of signal and took off, and 
they took off. And there was the space between that

20:41.910 --> 20:42.931
car and the one that Johnson and Lady Bird was in was

20:46.910 --> 20:50.850
at least far from here across the street. Do you, is 
it your assumption that Connolly, do you think

20:59.090 --> 21:04.110
that Connolly and Kennedy were riding together 
because Connolly had more prestige than Johnson,

21:10.090 --> 21:13.110
and that it would be more of a good of an appearance 
for them to be riding together? No, I think it was

21:17.090 --> 21:19.110
strictly a matter of protocol. Chief Executive of 
the nation visiting was a guest of the Chief

21:25.150 --> 21:27.170
Executive of the state, at the same token that the 
Lieutenant Governor would have been placed in a

21:34.800 --> 21:36.880
different car. The two of them had gone to 
Washington to see the President. That's

21:39.860 --> 21:41.880
something they drove around. The Governor and his 
wife was in the car with the President, his wife,

21:47.010 --> 21:50.030
and the Vice President. While

21:50.010 --> 21:58.980
in the military, did you receive any kind of 
commemoration

22:00.960 --> 22:09.630
in the military?

22:09.610 --> 22:11.226
Commendations. Special recommendations. Not 
particularly

22:13.610 --> 22:18.940
just theater and combat song decor. I did receive a 
certificate of appreciation and a half-h arm from

22:32.630 --> 22:34.650
the United States Air Force. And while you had been 
on the Houston police force, have you ever

22:39.090 --> 22:40.111
received any kind of accommodation? While you 
were on there, did you receive any kind of

22:45.600 --> 22:47.620
accommodations from the Houston police before 
apartment? Nothing more than letters of

22:50.600 --> 22:52.620
accommodation. A bunch of them. Two or one of them. 
Yesterday you said you had some

22:58.520 --> 23:05.130
kind, a whole wall full of... There they are. Okay.

23:10.464 --> 23:11.130
I want to interrupt you and I'm going to interrupt 
this for one moment. Let me say this before we shut

23:14.110 --> 23:15.131
this hall. What I have stated here is my opinion and 
is a result of my own investigation as best as I

23:19.420 --> 23:20.441
could go through with in this case. But it appears 
to me that I have established a motive for each of

23:24.850 --> 23:27.180
the individuals I have interviewed in this case. 
And I would like to say thank you for that.

23:38.219 --> 23:38.420
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank 
you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.906
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Great. Your 
honor. You know I think it's a very sorry name

24:25.520 --> 24:27.700
and Jack Ruby and Strictly Religious that 
motivated him. Okay. Everything that you have

24:32.097 --> 24:33.800
said right now, we discussed yesterday, and I 
asked your permission if you would be recorded.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.960
And nothing that we have said, nothing that has 
been said today has been pre-planned out to say.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.900
And you told me this yesterday that this has been 
your opinion, and I've come up with to you to no

24:56.870 --> 24:58.211
motive asking with no knowledge of my own, and I'm 
just trying to find out. I just want to learn your

25:06.390 --> 25:08.031
opinion. Is that correct? Right. And I have 
expressed this same opinion for the same reasons

25:14.020 --> 25:16.000
to lots of people over the years. I fully expect to 
express it to some more people. Okay. Nobody

25:21.461 --> 25:22.440
ever... Nobody ever... Nobody ever... Nobody 
ever promised me anything or... Okay. Tommy

25:27.927 --> 25:28.700
Suarez, this is Tommy Suarez, and he's been 
sitting here through the entire interview on both

25:34.060 --> 25:35.721
sides of the tapes, and he's listened to both sides 
of the tapes. And have we stopped? Have we stopped

25:40.640 --> 25:42.940
or have we edited anything in any way? No. No. No, 
I'm saying, have we stopped or have we edited

25:47.220 --> 25:49.120
anything? No. Okay. Okay. And right now, I'm going 
to cut this off because I... I want to see... I want

25:55.500 --> 25:56.661
to go see... I want to go see what he was telling me 
about about how his... what you have on your wall.

26:02.660 --> 26:03.841
And we'll resume the cinema. You're lying. I'm 
sorry. If everything that you said today, if we've

26:08.840 --> 26:10.640
not deleted anything out of this tape, and

26:11.840 --> 26:17.780
I've taken pictures of the documents that I said I 
was going to take pictures of and we're not

26:20.380 --> 26:23.240
concluding the interview, is there anything left 
that you would like to say?

26:28.760 --> 26:30.201
Nothing more than nothing. That I have formulated 
my opinion from the evidence that I have at hand and

26:37.920 --> 26:42.120
through application thereof to the rules of the 
criminal investigation and have arrived at the

26:46.540 --> 26:50.120
conclusion that the party's name herein is 
members of a conspiracy in the assassination of

26:57.980 --> 27:00.200
John Fitzgerald Kennedy, deceased, in the form 
of... President of the United States of America,

27:09.020 --> 27:11.420
would be the most logical of any people and for the 
reasons herein stipulated to have entered into a

27:15.680 --> 27:18.580
conspiracy to have committed this offense. Okay. 
It's 5.40 p.m. on March 12, 1980 and the interview

27:29.380 --> 27:30.901
has been... the interview has been completed.

27:37.230 --> 27:39.470
Today is March 13, 1980 and I'm just making this a 
follow-up. So that I don't forget on myself. When

27:44.250 --> 27:45.948
I... When I spoke with the man earlier... When I had 
spoken with the man the day before and I had talked

27:50.240 --> 27:51.621
to him earlier, he had said that Ruby had not enough 
control to outvote or at least to cause the

27:54.640 --> 27:57.380
redirect in certain policies or principles in the 
Dallas police station. Special notes to check.

28:05.810 --> 28:08.190
Why had Jack Ruby, whom was a strip joint operator, 
been so... closed to the Dallas police

28:11.560 --> 28:14.940
department? Also, on my initial interview, which 
was not recorded, which was the day before this

28:21.030 --> 28:23.570
original recording, I had been told that Johnson 
had instructed the motorcade route to be changed

28:31.710 --> 28:35.680
and that... that Mr... Excuse me for the 
interruption. That Mr. Evans had been involved in

28:37.060 --> 28:41.020
this information by... and that Kennedy was only 
notified... at the very last moment and was the

28:44.340 --> 28:48.360
only reason that he went along with this because 
Johnson said that it... Johnson had said or is

28:51.580 --> 28:58.480
reported to have conveniently talked him into... 
that this change would be more politically

29:02.520 --> 29:09.040
profitable. Special notes which I'd like to make. 
Just special notes. Now... This is... I've got to

29:18.940 --> 29:20.640
write a letter to the prison. I've got to be done 
for. I'm a... A little... Not to say that it's...

29:25.760 --> 29:27.800
It's too early. I... I... I'm not done. I'd like 
to... I'm not done. I'm not done. I'm done. I'm

29:37.827 --> 29:38.680
done. I'm still not done... I'm still not done. 
I... I'm still not done. I'm not done. I'm... I have

29:46.006 --> 29:46.541
to... I can't write. I can't... The other point to 
note is why would Johnson accept the

29:51.473 --> 29:58.120
vice-presidential nomination at the time he was 
Speaker of the House when the Speaker of the House

29:58.100 --> 30:06.840
is undisputedly considered to have more 
authority or at least more of being in a position of

30:06.820 --> 30:16.420
persuasion if not his motives have been for more 
power. Another point that I'd like to remember to

30:20.030 --> 30:27.800
investigate is did Ruby Clifton stop in between 
Mexico and why have none of the reports dealt with

30:27.780 --> 30:34.860
if he has or if he hasn't. Also note General Walker I 
want to find out more about him I was told and I don't

30:34.840 --> 30:45.020
remember if this was on tape that there was an 
attempt on his life a bullet hole went through his

30:52.260 --> 30:52.703
window. I nearly missed him and this is publicly 
acknowledged can be found in most periodicals.

30:59.060 --> 31:08.040
One of the parts that wasn't recorded that I've 
seen in my notes that Parr is indebted to LBJ for ten

31:08.020 --> 31:19.980
years of his life or there was and in reference to 
that I suppose that the alleged assassination

31:19.960 --> 31:26.000
conspiracy would have wiped out the news. Also

31:25.980 --> 31:36.600
I cannot recollect correctly but there was some 
mention about the gun about Oswald's gun having

31:36.580 --> 31:51.170
not been in normal

31:36.580 --> 31:51.170
custody after his apprehension for a couple of 
hours. These couple of hours are lagging time

31:51.150 --> 31:55.940
which is a point that needs to be investigated. 
Nearly all reports have been found. I don't know if

31:56.920 --> 32:00.460
there are any other reports. I don't know. Nearly 
all the information on this tape is of course

32:01.440 --> 32:11.490
public knowledge and is the experience of one man 
who I consider to be of extremely high

32:11.470 --> 32:20.980
intelligence.

32:20.960 --> 32:33.240
The fact that he has presented, he has presented 
well and he has at all times

32:20.960 --> 32:33.240
adhered to his police mentality. I don't know. He 
has stake in the community and police and

32:35.220 --> 32:44.060
prejudism of using alleged and possible and 
probable and that certain things are not a common

32:44.040 --> 32:49.380
procedure. Conclusion, Mr. John B Evans has 
granted me the right to use any and every part of

32:49.360 --> 32:57.780
this interview for my research. I do, I realize 
this interview does not bring to light any news.

33:03.700 --> 33:04.911
experiencing. I am a doctor. new evidence, but it 
does express some motives and circumstances that

33:05.240 --> 33:14.410
in my opinion deserve to be researched.
