00:02.208 --> 00:11.267
12, 1980 and Tommy Suarez of 5010 Oak Shadows is 
here and he's listening to everything that has

00:02.208 --> 00:11.267
been said. Have you in any way been coerced into 
saying anything or you're saying this completely

00:11.888 --> 00:20.065
on your own? It's my own free will. It's my firm 
belief and has been since the day of the

00:23.473 --> 00:30.711
assassination in 1963. Okay. We can continue. I 
just, I'm going to...

00:40.700 --> 00:55.961
You were telling me yesterday that, and I can't 
remember because when I went back to the house I

00:40.700 --> 00:55.961
wrote some notes down but I couldn't remember all, 
there was something that you had said that had been

00:40.700 --> 00:55.961
deleted from the Warren Commission and all the 
other investigations.

00:58.285 --> 01:07.197
The bulk of that investigation has been sealed. 
And I believe at the time it was set at 80 years

01:08.459 --> 01:20.232
before it would ever be opened and displayed to the 
public.

01:20.252 --> 01:33.167
And if you can believe what you see on television 
and read in the news and hear on radio, certain

01:20.252 --> 01:33.167
individuals who believe there was more than one 
gunman involved

01:35.678 --> 02:01.770
and who have played back reported portions of the 
incident, some of which was supposed to have been

01:35.678 --> 02:01.770
recorded at Dallas Police Headquarters. And 
their dispatching mechanism tape because of the

02:05.682 --> 02:24.602
mobile unit's microphone on the motorcycle of one 
of the Dallas police officers who was riding

02:05.682 --> 02:24.602
escort that there was a were shots fired and had 
been stipulated in the various reports and that

02:26.405 --> 02:54.825
some witnesses have claimed that there was a

02:26.405 --> 02:54.825
visual evidence to them of additional gunfire 
from a knoll long near the book storage building I

02:56.240 --> 03:20.172
believe this knoll would have been a little bit 
southwest of the southwest corner of the building

02:56.240 --> 03:20.172
and would have been northwest of the path of the 
automobile the president and vice president were

02:56.240 --> 03:20.172
riding

02:56.240 --> 03:20.172
in. I was watching this motorcade proceed through 
Dallas on television live at the time the

03:21.080 --> 03:33.014
assassination occurred.

03:33.034 --> 03:46.090
But through that media, I was not able to hear 
anything that I could distinguish as a sound

03:33.034 --> 03:46.090
gunfire. However, in the transfer from the Dallas 
police station to the Dallas County Jail, which

03:52.400 --> 03:59.250
was attempted on Sunday morning. Once again, I was 
watching that live on television and I did hear the

03:59.270 --> 04:20.922
report of firearms or a reasonable facsimile 
thereof at the incident that Jack Ruby surged

03:59.270 --> 04:20.922
towards Lee Harvey Oswald and And Oswald folded 
over and grasped his midriff and then reportedly

04:22.758 --> 04:41.915
died, practically in the arms of a police captain. 
And I did distinctly hear that police captain say,

04:41.935 --> 04:50.782
Jack, you son of a bitch. To Jack Rutherford. Is it 
common procedure for when they're escorting

04:53.032 --> 05:05.510
somebody for a policeman not to be in front of the 
person that they're escorting out?

05:08.053 --> 05:22.954
Proper procedure for a police officer or anybody 
else to escort a prisoner is the party that has

05:08.053 --> 05:22.954
control of the prisoner walks behind the prisoner 
But in this kind of situation that's transpired

05:25.195 --> 05:42.418
there, there was numerous

05:25.195 --> 05:42.418
peace officers of all categories there, all 
around Lee

05:25.195 --> 05:42.418
Harvey Austin. And had it not been for the familiar 
sight of Jack Ruby around the Dallas police

05:42.659 --> 05:54.595
station over the period of a couple, three months 
prior to this occurrence, Ruby would never have

05:55.300 --> 06:03.673
been able to even gotten on the ground.

06:08.058 --> 06:11.602
I see, I see that. And my question is, do you 
consider it to have been a proper procedure the way

06:12.263 --> 06:20.433
that they were escorting him out? Nothing wrong 
with the procedure that they were using to escort

06:20.453 --> 06:23.857
him. Their belief was that everybody had been okay 
to be there and screamed and with not any threat to

06:23.877 --> 06:32.827
life or the prisoner at all. He was being properly 
escorted with the captain of the police on one side

06:38.163 --> 06:48.804
of him and some other police official on the other 
side, a commissioned peace officer. And they each

06:50.407 --> 06:55.437
had a hold of the arm. That captain had a hold of 
Oswald's right arm and some other individual. had

07:00.539 --> 07:14.019
his left arm, and they were walking the captain 
just barely to his right rear, almost the rest of

07:00.539 --> 07:14.019
him and the other officer in a similar position on 
the left side. So it wasn't a matter of not having

07:14.039 --> 07:18.145
sufficient numbers of security. And operating in 
a firm belief that they had screened everybody and

07:19.808 --> 07:29.803
that there was nobody that would be any threat to 
the prisoner present. And I can't fault the Dallas

07:32.028 --> 07:40.699
Police Department on this thing at all. But

07:42.762 --> 08:00.465
insofar as their method that they were using to 
transport it, that I would be somewhat tempted to

07:42.762 --> 08:00.465
criticize news media.

08:03.263 --> 08:27.263
Because in the book that the chief of police at that 
time, Dallas, wrote on the subject, he was

08:03.263 --> 08:27.263
somewhat coerced by the news media,

08:03.263 --> 08:27.263
which can unseat just about any individual from 
any public office that they decide to, including

08:03.263 --> 08:27.263
any president of the United States. with such 
action if he didn't have this thing in the daytime

08:29.268 --> 08:51.159
where the majority of people would be able to watch 
it going on on television live at the burst of

08:29.268 --> 08:51.159
between 2 and 4 o'clock a.m. when practically 
everybody had been in bed asleep and nobody must be

08:29.268 --> 08:51.159
watching it live on television. Matter of fact, at 
that time, the local television stations here

08:58.917 --> 09:03.083
Didn't even operate at that time of the morning. 
Shut down. Some of them don't nap. Leave the area at

09:09.392 --> 09:12.336
1 o'clock, 1.30. And I don't think any of them stay 
all night. Still have a shut down period

09:16.522 --> 09:20.729
sometimes. Can you give me any information on this 
General Walker? he spoke of earlier? He was, after

09:27.537 --> 09:32.743
he had retired, he had become... He retired from 
where? From the military army. He retired, I

09:37.188 --> 09:41.573
believe, a major general. And was very active in 
the field of politics in the Democrat Party. And I

09:51.095 --> 09:59.787
don't even recall what his first name

09:51.095 --> 09:59.787
initially was. Okay.

10:04.374 --> 10:18.013
But I refuse to concede the idea that Lee Martin 
Oswald was a spy for the Soviet Union, because a spy

10:04.374 --> 10:18.013
for the Soviet Union would not make a point of going 
marry a Russian woman and bring her to live in

10:19.158 --> 10:24.949
Dallas, Texas. He's trying to be a spy. Give me a 
complete flop. Because she didn't have his cover

10:30.600 --> 10:32.985
blown before he ever started. And a spy with no 
cover is no spy. They are gonna, you know, it's

10:37.534 --> 10:40.660
gonna... it's going to bring attention at least to 
watch him and see what is going on. Yeah. I

10:47.421 --> 10:50.946
understand that by what I understand that's what 
you're saying. He was supposed to have been under

10:51.026 --> 10:58.077
some kind of surveillance, but certainly wasn't 
under that close surveillance at that time. They

10:58.097 --> 10:59.018
knew where he was. They knew he was in Dallas 
somewhere. They could undoubtedly have found

11:02.083 --> 11:03.745
him. The problem seemed like to find his wife and 
family and all that after this thing happened.

11:10.986 --> 11:11.948
They didn't? They did. Not only found them, but 
also found that he was the breadwinner for a place

11:13.970 --> 11:27.908
to live for he and his wife in Dallas. They had been 
living in Fort Worth, his mother in Dallas, and

11:28.308 --> 11:32.333
vice versa. He was keeping up both homes.

11:37.222 --> 11:40.346
He wasn't even looking all this round to Mexico 
City and back. He wasn't supposed to even have a

11:40.366 --> 11:44.012
job, period. No way in

11:44.032 --> 11:51.743
the time that anybody knew that at all. He was 
financing and living some kind of way. And, of

11:52.684 --> 11:59.394
course, they claimed they checked this all out and 
that he had sufficient funds coming in from some

11:52.684 --> 11:59.394
source. I never even know where to have done this 
all. And it has never been... clear in my mind what

12:06.432 --> 12:12.479
mode of transportation he used to get to Mexico 
City, but nobody ever mentioned that. He drove

12:12.559 --> 12:17.786
down there, walked, hitchhiked.

12:17.806 --> 12:18.386
How'd he got there? On a bus? He didn't go on a train, 
but he went across the river end at Roma if he had

12:19.348 --> 12:30.561
anything for a train to go to Roma about. Nothing 
there. We needed the transport on the train. We

12:36.537 --> 12:39.602
didn't produce anything. We walked the area 
around our little village there on the river.

12:45.171 --> 12:45.552
Okay. An old city on the opposite side of Mexico was 
the window town or whatever it was then. The

12:50.720 --> 12:55.508
nearest place after you got over there was San 
Pedro and it was... At that time, about the same

12:57.260 --> 13:04.369
size as Humber was at that time. Which I wouldn't 
love it if you told me it was 1963. Humber's a pretty

13:08.434 --> 13:14.322
good side of the town now, but it sure wasn't in 
1963. Well, you said that you served in the service

13:14.342 --> 13:22.052
from the years of... Could you repeat that again? 
When I was in the military? Right. From August the

13:25.542 --> 13:30.030
7th, 1940 to July 28th, 1945. And what was your rank 
in the military? Highest rank I held, and I was

13:35.521 --> 13:38.827
sergeant. I did attend the officer candidate 
school and resigned out of it the day before I was to

13:38.847 --> 13:45.660
be commissioned as a personal agent.

13:49.927 --> 13:57.995
You said that you know that, I don't know, that 
relations or something like that in Starr County.

13:59.597 --> 14:02.279
Did you know somebody who lived in Starr County?

14:04.902 --> 14:19.056
While I was stationed there, the only somebody 
that I ever knew there at that time, the city

14:04.902 --> 14:19.056
marshal there, a fellow by the name of Sanchez, I

14:20.150 --> 14:26.365
was real well acquainted with him. I knew him and 
talked to him a few times. I know a lot of people

14:32.019 --> 14:34.345
there. I know that the information has been that 
the great influx of recent years, the great influx

14:35.017 --> 14:53.785
of legal drugs of various kinds, marijuana, I 
don't know, hashish, heroin, a whole bag of

14:35.017 --> 14:53.785
tricks. It was coming through there and some 
people built some awful pretty homes. At least

15:01.691 --> 15:08.700
that's what they showed to be on the television out 
on the place that didn't produce anything. They'd

15:08.720 --> 15:11.604
find homes out there anyway. I don't know where 
they'd get their money from. Oil there. Great

15:16.210 --> 15:19.535
shakes for grazing cattle. Probably that area 
right along there where those homes were. Fifty

15:24.190 --> 15:32.963
acres might

15:24.190 --> 15:32.963
support a count. Maybe. And, of course, we never 
had any hard winter that would support them any

15:33.124 --> 15:44.120
time, support them year-round, but it takes so 
many acres to do it, and I doubt anybody had that

15:33.124 --> 15:44.120
many in that area. There's a lot of very fine homes 
built all along that road, between them for

15:44.140 --> 15:52.493
several miles, right up to the edge of Star County. 
towards the mission to the east of the city. Showed

15:58.662 --> 16:04.247
these pictures and highway numbers and all this 
stuff right there. Along the north of the road were

16:04.267 --> 16:11.875
the, what they called them, skeet specials.

16:11.895 --> 16:17.341
Railroad tracks around the south of the highway. 
These houses seemed to be all, practically all of

16:17.361 --> 16:19.763
them on the north side of the road. Wasn't much of 
anything. and certainly nothing but brush and

16:21.717 --> 16:34.056
that kind of stuff from there back to the banks of 
the Rio Grande.

16:34.356 --> 16:39.564
Army post there, Fort Ringgold, sat right on the 
bank of the Rio Grande. Can you tell me from the time

16:39.624 --> 16:43.590
that you started and to your police career as to 
where you have been, you have worked for, for what

16:43.942 --> 16:54.167
police, for what police agencies you have worked 
for? What police stations? Since you have

16:57.374 --> 17:03.162
retired, since you got out of the military, have 
you always been to the police force? Right. And can

17:03.822 --> 17:06.166
you tell me what the police force... I was 
discharged on a Friday, July the 28th, 1945. And

17:11.132 --> 17:21.365
Monday morning, I went down and answered to an ad in 
the local paper and applied for a job at the Houston

17:11.132 --> 17:21.365
Police Department. And on the 13th day of 
August... I was called to the station and sworn in

17:24.425 --> 17:39.042
as a police officer and given an assignment to work 
the VJ day

17:24.425 --> 17:39.042
parade. And so you have always said the police 
agency that you have always worked with has been

17:39.062 --> 17:43.987
HPD. Have you ever... seen any material any 
confidential material that is dealt with with any

17:47.611 --> 18:04.202
Kennedy related material

17:47.611 --> 18:04.202
without divulging any you know on any uh written 
material or anything pertaining to this

18:04.739 --> 18:08.744
assassination? That is not, that's not public.

18:13.410 --> 18:15.212
No, okay. We had nothing in our files. I had access 
to

18:17.515 --> 18:23.182
any files we had. And, uh, no, we had nothing to 
investigate. To make any files, yeah. As far as I

18:30.372 --> 18:46.292
know, other than the possibility that he may have 
passed through sometime, if Lee Harvey Osborn was

18:30.372 --> 18:46.292
ever

18:30.372 --> 18:46.292
in Houston, I don't know. John Kennedy was here 
during that same period. He was here when they were

18:49.536 --> 18:56.565
campaigning for the presidency and all, and then 
he was here During that time, when Johnson was

18:57.271 --> 19:15.390
here, after he was president, I went out to Hobby 
Air Force and was part of the police

18:57.271 --> 19:15.390
security out there. He and Lady Bird came down and 
he and Humphrey and his wife came with them. You

19:23.275 --> 19:33.068
have told me that LBJ was not in the same car with 
Kennedy or Conley and that was perfect. Kennedy

19:33.088 --> 19:50.532
and Conley was in the same car, but as the 
motorcades went by on television, there was a car

19:33.088 --> 19:50.532
they were in and then you would see the president 
lurch back like this in the seat. And it seemed like

19:50.866 --> 20:00.039
John Conley lurched over this way at the same time 
and kind of down. And Jackie Kennedy crawled over

20:01.961 --> 20:19.405
the back seat and back on the trunk of the open-top 
car and seemed to be trying to do something for the

20:20.178 --> 20:24.523
president and the Secret Service. Men were 
running along behind. At least one of them climbed

20:27.306 --> 20:35.335
up on

20:27.306 --> 20:35.335
the trunk of the car. And somebody gave some kind of 
signal and took off. And they took off. And there

20:40.120 --> 20:49.290
was the space between that car and the one that 
Johnson and Layward was in was... Do you,

20:49.912 --> 21:07.431
is it your assumption

20:49.912 --> 21:07.431
that Conley, do you think that Conley and Kennedy 
were riding Because Conley had more prestige than

21:07.799 --> 21:17.273
Johnson, and that it would be more of a good of an 
appearance for them to be riding together? No, I

21:17.293 --> 21:20.939
think it was strictly a matter of protocol. The 
chief executive of the nation visiting was a guest

21:21.640 --> 21:32.035
of the chief executive of the state, under the same 
token that the lieutenant governor. would have

21:32.015 --> 21:38.606
been placed in a different car. The two of them had 
gone to Washington to see the president. That's

21:44.295 --> 21:46.779
something they drove around. The governor and his 
wife was in the car with the president

21:47.260 --> 21:54.431
and his wife and the vice president. I think it's 
just protocol on everything else. Okay. While in

21:57.463 --> 22:06.135
the military, did you receive any kind of 
commemorations

21:57.463 --> 22:06.135
in the military? Like what? Just anything. Have 
you ever been given special work? Decorations or

22:13.005 --> 22:14.447
anything. Right. Not particularly just theater 
and combat zone. Decor and... I did receive a

22:25.323 --> 22:36.173
certificate of appreciation from Half H. Arnold, 
the Commander General of the United States Air

22:25.323 --> 22:36.173
Force. Okay. And while you had been on the Houston 
Police Force, have you ever received any

22:36.854 --> 22:41.719
accommodations? I mean, while you were on there, 
did you receive any kind of accommodations from

22:41.739 --> 22:48.745
the Houston Police Department? Nothing more than 
letters of accommodation, a bunch of them, a tool

22:48.765 --> 22:54.891
of one kind. um yesterday you said you had some uh 
some kind a whole wall full of uh there they are okay

22:56.035 --> 23:25.941
i i wouldn't i want to interrupt i'm going to 
interrupt this for that let me uh let me say this

22:56.035 --> 23:25.941
before we get this all that what i have stated here 
is my opinion and is uh the result of uh my own

23:26.984 --> 23:40.043
investigation as best as I could

23:26.984 --> 23:40.043
go through with in this case. But it appears to me 
that I have established a motive for each of the

23:40.224 --> 23:54.825
individuals that I have named as probable 
conspirators in this incident. A motive of of

23:56.836 --> 24:06.810
Lyndon Baines Johnson

23:56.836 --> 24:06.810
wanting

23:56.836 --> 24:06.810
to be President of the United States. George Parr 
trying to repay Johnson for procuring

24:08.873 --> 24:19.688
presidential pardons for some 20 years of his 
life. Lee Harvey Oswald, an opportunity of

24:21.355 --> 24:31.050
revenge against John Connolly and Jack Ruby, a 
strictly religious motivated

24:21.355 --> 24:31.050
him. Okay. Everything that you have said right 
now, we discussed yesterday, and I asked your

24:32.052 --> 24:39.644
permission if you would be recorded. And nothing 
that we have said, nothing that has been said today

24:39.664 --> 24:48.257
has been pre-planned out to say And you told me this 
yesterday that this has been your opinion. And

24:53.344 --> 25:04.018
I've come up to you with no motive asking with no 
knowledge of my own. And I'm just trying to find

25:04.319 --> 25:05.841
out. I just want to learn your opinion. Is that 
correct? Right. And I have expressed the same

25:10.428 --> 25:17.041
opinion for the same reasons to lots of people over 
the years. I fully expect to express it to some more

25:17.061 --> 25:22.272
people. Nobody ever promised me anything. Tommy 
Suarez, this is Tommy Suarez, and he's been

25:27.353 --> 25:37.676
sitting here through the entire interview on both 
sides of the tapes, and he's listened to both sides

25:27.353 --> 25:37.676
of the tapes. And have we stopped? Have we stopped 
or have we edited anything in any way? No. No, I'm

25:45.646 --> 25:49.251
saying, have we stopped or have we edited 
anything? No. Okay, okay. And right now, I'm going

25:51.855 --> 26:02.110
to cut this off because I want to go see what he was 
telling me about, about what you have on your wall.

26:02.731 --> 26:03.953
And we'll resume the cinema. You're lying, I'm 
sorry. Everything that you said today, we've not

26:06.797 --> 26:12.565
deleted anything out of this tape, and...

26:16.797 --> 26:23.387
I've taken pictures of the documents that I said I 
was going to take pictures of and we're now

26:16.797 --> 26:23.387
concluding the interview. Is there anything left 
that you would like to say? Nothing

26:25.871 --> 26:43.277
more than that I have formulated my opinion from 
the evidence that I had at hand and through

26:25.871 --> 26:43.277
application thereof to the The rules of criminal 
investigation have arrived at the conclusion

26:44.489 --> 27:06.160
that the party's name herein is members of a 
conspiracy in the assassination of John

26:44.489 --> 27:06.160
Fitzgerald Kennedy, deceased former president 
of the United States of America. would be the most

27:08.941 --> 27:22.316
logical of any people, and for the reasons herein 
stipulated, to have entered into a conspiracy, to

27:08.941 --> 27:22.316
have committed this offense. Okay. It's 5.40 p.m. 
on March the 12th, 1980, and the interview has been

27:25.099 --> 27:32.687
completed.

27:37.342 --> 27:43.651
Today is March 13, 1980, and I'm just making this a 
follow-up note so that I don't forget on myself.

27:45.934 --> 28:02.556
When I had spoken with the man the day before and I 
had talked to him earlier, he had said that Ruby had

27:45.934 --> 28:02.556
not enough control to outvote or at least to cause 
the redirect in certain policies or principles in

27:45.934 --> 28:02.556
the Dallas Police Station. Special notes to 
check. Why had Jack Ruby, whom was a strip joint

28:05.807 --> 28:15.037
operator, been so close to the Dallas Police 
Department? Also, on my initial interview, which

28:17.239 --> 28:33.015
was not recorded, which was the day before this 
original recording, I had been told that Johnson

28:17.239 --> 28:33.015
had instructed the motorcade route to be changed 
and that that mr excuse me from the interruption

28:34.531 --> 28:47.342
but that mr evans had been devoted this 
information by and that kennedy was only notified

28:34.531 --> 28:47.342
at the very last moment and was The only reason that 
he went along with this is because Johnson said

28:47.643 --> 29:09.263
that Johnson had said or is reported to have 
conveniently talked him into that this change

28:47.643 --> 29:09.263
would be more politically profitable. Special 
notes, which I'd like to make, just special notes,

29:11.318 --> 29:39.958
is Connolly's refusal to pardon Oswell, that 
Sanchez, who was the sheriff of Starr County, Coke

29:11.318 --> 29:39.958
Stevenson, Truman's pardon of par, Al Smith in 28, 
and it has not been mentioned, but it had been

29:11.318 --> 29:39.958
mentioned by Conley that

29:41.221 --> 29:47.949
Kennedy's trip to Texas was dangerous.

29:51.053 --> 30:08.393
Also, other points to note is why would Johnson 
accept the vice presidential nomination at the

29:51.053 --> 30:08.393
time he was Speaker at the House when the Speaker of 
the House is undisputedly considered to have more

29:51.053 --> 30:08.393
authority or at least more of being in a position of 
persuasion if not his motives have been for more

30:08.727 --> 30:18.477
power. Another point that I'd like to remember to 
investigate is did Ruby Clifton stop in between

30:19.958 --> 30:33.191
Mexico and why have none of the reports dealt with 
if he has or if he hasn't. Also note General Walker.

30:41.502 --> 30:43.084
I want to find out more about him. I was told, and I 
don't remember if this was on tape, that there was

30:43.124 --> 30:50.632
an attempt on his life. A bullet hole went through 
his window and nearly missed him. And this is

30:54.537 --> 30:58.922
publicly knowledge can be found in most 
periodicals. One other part that wasn't recorded

31:00.043 --> 31:04.789
that I've seen in my notes that parr is indebted to 
lbj for 10 years of his life or there was in in

31:06.203 --> 31:35.299
reference to that i suppose that the alleged 
assassination conspiracy would have wiped out

31:06.203 --> 31:35.299
the debt uh also i cannot recollect correctly but 
there was some mention about the gun about

31:35.718 --> 31:50.165
Oswald's gun having not been in normal

31:35.718 --> 31:50.165
custody after his apprehension for a couple of 
hours. These couple of hours are lagging time

31:51.086 --> 31:57.979
which are a point that needs to be investigated.

32:00.710 --> 32:18.028
Nearly all the information on this tape is of 
course public knowledge and is the experience of

32:00.710 --> 32:18.028
one man who I consider to be of extremely high 
intelligence.

32:20.892 --> 32:28.860
The fact that he has presented, he has presented 
well and he has at all times adhered to his police

32:30.123 --> 32:59.050
mentality and police and prejudice and of using 
alleged and possible and probable and that

32:30.123 --> 32:59.050
certain things are not common procedure 
conclusion mr. John B Evans has granted me the

32:30.123 --> 32:59.050
right to use any and every part of this interview 
for my research I realize that this interview does

32:59.789 --> 33:15.537
not bring to light any new evidence, but it does 
express some motives and circumstances that in my

32:59.789 --> 33:15.537
opinion deserve to be researched.
