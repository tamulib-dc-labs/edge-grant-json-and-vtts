WEBVTT

00:02.208 --> 00:11.283
12, 1980, and Tommy Suarez of 5010 Oak Shadows is 
here, and he's listening to everything that has

00:02.208 --> 00:11.283
been said. Have you in any way been coerced into 
saying anything, or you're saying this

00:11.904 --> 00:20.217
completely on your own? It's my own free will and 
it's my firm belief and has been since the day of the

00:20.956 --> 00:35.073
assassination in 1963.

00:40.800 --> 00:41.101
Okay. You were telling me yesterday that And I 
can't remember, because when I went back to the

00:43.214 --> 00:48.380
house, I wrote some notes down, but I couldn't 
remember all. There was something that you had

00:48.761 --> 00:55.989
said that had been deleted from the Warren 
Commission and all the other investigations.

00:58.692 --> 01:07.062
The bulk of that investigation has been sealed. 
And I believe the period of time was set at 80 years

01:08.527 --> 01:17.419
before they would be opened and displayed to the 
public.

01:20.283 --> 01:38.247
And if you can believe what you see on television 
and read in the news and hear on radio, certain

01:20.283 --> 01:38.247
individuals who

01:20.283 --> 01:38.247
believe there was more than one gunmen involved

01:38.463 --> 02:00.128
and who have played back recorded portions of the 
incident, some of which were supposed to have been

01:38.463 --> 02:00.128
recorded at Dallas Police Headquarters. And 
their dispatching mechanism put on tape Because

02:08.534 --> 02:36.195
of the mobile unit's microphone on the 
motorcycle, one of the Dallas police officers who

02:08.534 --> 02:36.195
was riding escort, that there was over shots fired 
and had been stipulated in the various reports and

02:08.534 --> 02:36.195
that some witnesses have claimed that there was a 
visual

02:38.521 --> 02:54.686
evidence to them of additional gunfire from a 
knoll long near the book storage building. I

02:56.409 --> 03:06.064
believe this knoll would have been a little bit 
southwest of the southwest corner of the building

02:56.409 --> 03:06.064
and would have been northwest of the path of the 
automobile the President and the Vice President

03:06.719 --> 03:21.335
were riding in.

03:21.355 --> 03:33.048
I was watching this motorcade proceed through 
Dallas on television, live, at the time the

03:21.355 --> 03:33.048
assassination occurred.

03:33.068 --> 03:36.051
But through that media, I was not able to hear 
anything that I could distinguish as sound

03:37.330 --> 03:46.302
gunfire. However, in the transfer from the Dallas 
Police Station to the Dallas County Jail, which

03:46.322 --> 03:57.718
was attempted on Sunday morning, Once again, I was 
watching that live on television and I did hear the

03:59.133 --> 04:28.836
report of firearms or a reasonable facsimile 
thereof at the incident that Jack Ruby surged

03:59.133 --> 04:28.836
towards Lee Harvey Oswald and Oswald folded over 
and grasped his midriff and then reportedly died,

04:30.537 --> 04:39.809
practically in the arms of a police captain. And I 
did distinctly hear that police captain say,

04:41.972 --> 04:51.465
Jack, you son of a bitch, to Jack Rutherford. Is it 
common procedure for when they're escorting

04:53.048 --> 05:05.525
somebody for a policeman not to be in front of the 
person that they're escorting out?

05:08.068 --> 05:22.988
Proper procedure for a police officer or anybody 
else to escort a prisoner is the party that has

05:08.068 --> 05:22.988
control of the prisoner walks behind the 
prisoner. But in this kind of situation that's

05:25.212 --> 05:42.434
transpired there, there was numerous

05:25.212 --> 05:42.434
peace officers of all categories there, all 
around Lee Harvey

05:25.212 --> 05:42.434
Osmond. And had it not been for the familiar sight 
of Jack Ruby around the Dallas police station over

05:42.735 --> 05:54.510
the period of a couple of free months prior to this 
occurrence, Ruby would never have been able to

05:55.317 --> 06:08.591
even gotten on the grounds.

06:08.611 --> 06:11.034
I see, I see that. And my question is, do you 
consider it to have been a proper procedure the way

06:11.534 --> 06:19.823
that they were escorting him out? Nothing wrong 
with the procedure that they were using to escort

06:20.225 --> 06:23.868
him. Their belief was that everybody had been okay 
to be there and screamed and were not any threat to

06:23.888 --> 06:33.518
the life of the prisoner at all. He was being 
properly escorted by the captain of the police on

06:33.538 --> 06:48.932
one side of him and some other police official on 
the other side, a commissioned peace officer. and

06:50.195 --> 06:53.819
they each had a hold of an arm. That captain had a 
hold of Oswald's right arm and some other

06:53.839 --> 07:12.080
individual had his left arm, and they were walking 
the captain just barely to his right rear, almost

06:53.839 --> 07:12.080
the rest of him and the other officer in a similar 
position on the left side. So it wasn't a matter of

07:13.301 --> 07:18.447
not having sufficient numbers of security. and 
operating in the firm belief that they had

07:19.523 --> 07:32.502
screened everybody and that there was nobody that 
would be any threat to the prisoner present. And I

07:32.522 --> 07:48.045
can't fault the Dallas Police Department on this 
thing at all,

07:32.522 --> 07:48.045
but insofar as they're they were using to 
transport it, that I would be somewhat tempted to

07:49.561 --> 08:09.966
criticize news media

07:49.561 --> 08:09.966
because in the book that the chief police at that 
time in Dallas wrote and said

08:18.080 --> 08:29.355
which can unseat just about any individual from 
any public office that they decide to, including

08:18.080 --> 08:29.355
any president of the United States. With such 
action, if he didn't have this thing in the daytime

08:29.375 --> 08:42.012
where the majority of people would be able to watch 
it going on on television, live, as a burst of

08:42.380 --> 08:49.172
between 2 and 4 o'clock a.m. when practically 
everybody had been in bed asleep. I know everybody

08:49.232 --> 08:51.676
must be watching it live on television. Matter of 
fact, at that time, the local television stations

08:51.736 --> 09:05.941
here didn't even operate at that time of the 
morning. They shut down. Some of them don't now. I

09:08.688 --> 09:15.794
wouldn't leave the air until 1 o'clock, 1.30. And I 
don't think any of them stay all night. Still have a

09:16.735 --> 09:20.839
shut-out period of some time. Can you give me any 
information on this General Walker, who you spoke

09:20.859 --> 09:26.805
of earlier? He was, after he had retired, he had 
come... He retired from where? From the military

09:34.091 --> 09:36.113
army. He was retired, I believe, a major general. 
And was very active in the field of politics in the

09:41.810 --> 09:51.202
Democrat Party. And I don't even recall what his 
first

09:51.222 --> 10:00.154
name or initials was. Okay.

10:04.375 --> 10:24.966
But I refused to concede the idea that B. Harvey 
Oswald was a spy for the Soviet Union, because a spy

10:04.375 --> 10:24.966
for the Soviet Union would not make a point to go and 
marry a Russian woman and bring her to live in

10:04.375 --> 10:24.966
Dallas, Texas. He tried to be a spy, give me a 
complete flop, because she didn't have his cover

10:24.986 --> 10:32.998
blowed before he ever started. I mean, you know, 
when somebody's coming from Russia, they are

10:34.683 --> 10:46.058
going to, you know, it's going to bring attention 
at least to watch him and see what is going on. Yeah.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.042
I understand that. By what I understand, that's 
what you're saying. He was supposed to have been

10:50.864 --> 10:59.255
under some kind of surveillance, but certainly 
wasn't under that close surveillance at that

10:50.864 --> 10:59.255
time. I mean, he was in Dallas somewhere. You could 
undoubtedly find him. Big problem seemed like to

11:05.142 --> 11:10.989
find his wife and family and all that after this 
thing happened. They didn't? They did. Not only

11:13.992 --> 11:27.929
found them, but also found that he was the 
breadwinner for a place to live for he and his wife

11:13.992 --> 11:27.929
in Dallas. They had been living in Fort Worth, his 
mother in Dallas, and vice versa. He was keeping up

11:32.374 --> 11:34.677
both homes.

11:37.272 --> 11:42.437
and what he'd like to know is around Mexico City and 
back, he wasn't supposed to even have a job,

11:37.272 --> 11:42.437
period. No way in the time that anybody knew that at 
all. He was financing it. He was living some kind of

11:48.944 --> 11:52.708
way. And, of course, they claimed they checked 
this all out and that he had sufficient funds

11:52.728 --> 11:58.453
coming in from some source. I never even know where 
to have done this all. And it has never been...

12:06.398 --> 12:12.526
clear in my mind what mode of transportation he 
used to get to Mexico City, but nobody ever

12:06.398 --> 12:12.526
mentioned that. He drove down there, walked, 
hitchhiked.

12:17.812 --> 12:18.373
How'd he got there? On a bus? He didn't go on a train, 
because he went across the river end at Roma, if he

12:19.374 --> 12:25.141
had. There wasn't anything for a train to go to Roma 
about. Nothing there. that we needed to transport

12:32.167 --> 12:36.551
in that train. It didn't produce anything. It was 
just a rocky area around our little village there

12:39.534 --> 12:43.878
on the river. Okay. An old city on the opposite side 
in Mexico used to be in the town or anything like

12:44.879 --> 12:50.564
that then. The nearest place after you got over 
there was San Pedro, and it

12:50.804 --> 13:02.055
was at that time about the same size as Humber was.

13:06.085 --> 13:07.447
Yeah, 1963. I know it's a pretty good side of the 
town now, but it sure wouldn't be 1963. You said

13:16.437 --> 13:22.083
that you served in the service from the years of... 
Could you repeat that again? When I was in the

13:22.704 --> 13:24.106
military? Right. From August the 7th, 1940 to July 
28th, 1945. And what was your rank in the military?

13:34.790 --> 13:36.411
highest rank in health and I was sergeant. I did 
attend officer candidate school and resigned out

13:38.233 --> 13:50.024
of it the day before I was to be commissioned as a 
personal

13:38.233 --> 13:50.024
healer. You said that you, you say that you know 
that, I don't know, that relations or something

13:50.044 --> 13:58.051
like that in Starr County. Did you know somebody 
who lived in Starr County or? While I was stationed

14:04.895 --> 14:26.257
there, the only somebody that I ever knew there, at 
that time,

14:04.895 --> 14:26.257
the city marshal there, a fellow by the name of 
Sanchez, 1940, 1941, I was real well acquainted

14:04.895 --> 14:26.257
with him. I knew him, I've talked to

14:26.277 --> 14:32.023
him a few times, that's all. I know a lot of people 
there. I know that the information has been that

14:35.017 --> 14:53.768
the great influx of recent years, the great influx 
of drugs of various kinds, marijuana, hashish,

14:35.017 --> 14:53.768
heroin, a whole bag of tricks. It was coming 
through there, and some people built some awful

14:55.537 --> 15:08.670
pretty homes, at least that's what they showed to 
be on the television out on the place that didn't

14:55.537 --> 15:08.670
produce anything. They'd find homes out there 
anyway, before they'd get no money from the oil

15:08.690 --> 15:16.198
there. Great shakes for grazing cattle. Probably 
that area right along there where those homes

15:20.342 --> 15:23.485
were. 50 acres might support a county.

15:29.669 --> 15:30.070
Maybe. And, of course, we never had any hard winter 
that would support them any time, support them

15:31.492 --> 15:44.050
year-round, but it takes so many acres to do it, and 
I doubt anybody had that many in that area. There's

15:44.070 --> 15:52.543
a lot of very fine homes built all along that road 
between them for several miles, right out to the

15:44.070 --> 15:52.543
edge of Star County. towards the mission to the 
east of Riverview City. Showed these pictures and

15:58.539 --> 16:04.346
highway numbers and all this stuff right there. 
Along the north of the road were the, what they

16:04.366 --> 16:09.451
called them, Skeet Specials. Railroad tracks ran 
south of the highway. These houses seemed to be

16:15.999 --> 16:19.603
all, practically all of them on the north side of 
the road. Wasn't much of anything. And certainly

16:21.768 --> 16:34.288
nothing but brush and that kind of stuff from there 
back to the banks of the River Grand.

16:34.389 --> 16:40.018
Army post there, Fort Ringgold, sat right on the 
bank of the River Grand. Can you tell me from the

16:40.038 --> 16:48.872
time that you started into your police career as to 
where you have been? you have worked for for what

16:49.763 --> 17:07.941
police for what police agencies you have worked 
for what police stations or since you have retired

16:49.763 --> 17:07.941
since you got out of the military have you always 
been to the police force right and can you can you

16:49.763 --> 17:07.941
tell me i was discharged on a friday July the 28th, 
1945, and Monday morning I went down and answered

17:09.659 --> 17:21.471
to an ad in the local paper and applied for a job at 
the Houston Police Department. And on the 13th day

17:21.491 --> 17:34.705
of August, I was called to the station and sworn in 
as a police officer and given an assignment to work

17:21.491 --> 17:34.705
the VJ day for a...

17:38.954 --> 17:43.961
So the police agency that you have always worked 
with has been HPD. Have you ever seen any

17:45.423 --> 17:56.699
confidential material that has dealt with any 
Kennedy-related material? I don't know. Without

17:59.503 --> 18:04.270
divulging any... Any...

18:04.739 --> 18:28.840
uh written material or anything pertaining to 
this assassination that is not that's not public

18:04.739 --> 18:28.840
we had nothing in our files i had access to any files 
we had

18:04.739 --> 18:28.840
no we had nothing to investigate to make it a file 
yeah As far as I know, other than the possibility

18:30.389 --> 18:40.666
that he may have passed through some time, we ought 
to leave him with honors. If he was ever in

18:40.686 --> 18:46.276
Houston, I don't remember that. John Kennedy was 
here during that same period. He was here when they

18:49.581 --> 18:56.413
were campaigning for the presidency and all, and 
then he was here During that time, when Johnson was

18:57.625 --> 19:16.038
here, after he was president, I went out to Hobby 
Air Force,

18:57.625 --> 19:16.038
and was part of the police

18:57.625 --> 19:16.038
security out there. He and Lady Bird came down, and 
Hubert Humphrey and his wife came with them. You

19:23.191 --> 19:33.103
have told me that LBJ was not in the same car with 
Kennedy or Conley, and that was perfect. Kennedy

19:33.123 --> 19:50.143
and Conley was in the same car, but as the 
motorcades went by on television, there was a car

19:33.123 --> 19:50.143
they were in, and then you see the president lurch 
back like this in the seat. And it seemed like John

19:50.984 --> 20:00.053
Conley lurched over this way at the same time, kind 
of down. And Jackie Kennedy crawled over the back

20:01.974 --> 20:19.371
seat and back on the trunk of the open-top car and 
seemed to be trying to do something for the

20:20.262 --> 20:24.546
president and the Secret Service. We ended up 
running along behind at least one of them climbed

20:25.868 --> 20:40.043
up on the trunk of the car and somebody gave some 
kind of signal and took off and they took off. And

20:40.063 --> 20:49.172
there was the space between that car and the one 
that Johnson and Layward was in was Do you, is it

20:49.979 --> 21:08.798
your assumption

20:49.979 --> 21:08.798
that Conley, do you think that Conley and Kennedy 
were riding together because Conley had more

21:08.963 --> 21:17.105
prestige than Johnson and that it would be more of a 
good of an appearance for them to be riding

21:08.963 --> 21:17.105
together? No, I think it was strictly a matter of 
protocol. The chief executive of the nation

21:21.586 --> 21:28.135
visiting was a guest chief executive of the state. 
The same token that the lieutenant governor would

21:28.155 --> 21:39.911
have been placed in a different car if the two of 
them had gone to Washington to see the president.

21:39.931 --> 21:43.856
That's something they rolled around. The 
governor and his wife was in the car with the

21:43.876 --> 21:50.125
president and his wife to the vice president.

21:53.699 --> 21:57.465
Okay.

21:57.485 --> 22:06.178
While in the military, did you receive any kind of 
commemoration

21:57.485 --> 22:06.178
in the military?

22:09.162 --> 22:09.403
Like what? Just anything. Have you ever been given 
special recommendations?

22:16.914 --> 22:20.820
Not particularly just theater and combat. the 
Corps

22:22.083 --> 22:36.229
and I did receive a certificate of appreciation 
from half-age Arnold and then a general of the

22:22.083 --> 22:36.229
United States Air Force. Okay and while you had 
been on the Houston police force have you ever

22:36.249 --> 22:43.382
received any accommodation while you were on 
there? Did you receive any kind of accommodations

22:44.358 --> 22:48.027
from the Houston Police Department for 
apartment? Nothing more than letters of

22:48.728 --> 22:56.467
accommodation, a bunch of them, two or one and a 
half. Yesterday you said you had some...

23:01.469 --> 23:03.952
some kind of a whole wall full of... There they are. 
Okay. I want to interrupt. I'm going to interrupt

23:11.321 --> 23:13.604
this for one moment. Let me say this before we shut 
this off. What I have stated here is my opinion and

23:18.850 --> 23:28.422
is a result of my own... investigation as best as i 
could

23:30.376 --> 23:59.758
go through with in this case but it appears to me 
that i have established a motive for each of the

23:30.376 --> 23:59.758
individuals i have named as probable 
conspirators in this incident the motive of uh of

23:30.376 --> 23:59.758
uh lemon baines johnson being wanting

24:01.392 --> 24:06.860
to be President of the United States. George Parr 
trying to repay Johnson for procuring

24:08.883 --> 24:19.279
presidential pardons for some 20 years of his 
life. Lee Harvey Oswald, an opportunity of

24:21.543 --> 24:30.336
revenge against John Connolly and Jack Ruby, a 
strictly religious thing, motivated him. Okay.

24:32.072 --> 24:39.644
Everything that you have said right now, we 
discussed yesterday, and I asked your permission

24:32.072 --> 24:39.644
if you would be recorded. And nothing that we have 
said, nothing that has been said today has been

24:40.685 --> 24:47.937
pre-planned out to say. And you told me this 
yesterday that this has been your opinion, and

24:47.957 --> 24:59.074
I've come up to you to no motive asking... with no 
knowledge of mine and I'm just trying to find out I

24:59.392 --> 25:21.552
just want to learn your opinion is that correct 
right and I have expressed this same opinion for

24:59.392 --> 25:21.552
the same reasons lots of people over you fully 
expect to express

24:59.392 --> 25:21.552
it Okay. Tommy Suarez, this is Tommy Suarez, and 
he's been sitting here through the entire

25:26.608 --> 25:38.311
interview on both sides of the tapes, and he's 
listened to both sides of the tapes. And have we

25:38.331 --> 25:39.353
stopped? Have we stopped or have we edited 
anything in any way? No. No, I'm saying, have we

25:45.730 --> 25:49.274
stopped or have we edited anything? No. Okay, 
okay. And right now, I'm going to cut this off

25:51.877 --> 26:02.109
because I want to go see what he was telling me 
about, about what you have on your wall. And we'll

26:02.790 --> 26:03.971
resume the cinema. You're lying, I'm sorry. 
Everything that you said today, we've not deleted

26:06.815 --> 26:12.261
anything out of this tape and

26:16.814 --> 26:23.465
I've taken pictures of the documents that I said I 
was going to take pictures of and we're now

26:16.814 --> 26:23.465
concluding the interview. Is there anything left 
that you would like to say? Nothing

26:25.909 --> 26:43.378
more than that I have formulated my opinion from 
the evidence that I had at hand and through

26:25.909 --> 26:43.378
application thereof to the The rules of criminal 
investigation have arrived at the conclusion

26:44.472 --> 27:06.278
that the party's name herein is members of a 
conspiracy in the assassination of John

26:44.472 --> 27:06.278
Fitzgerald Kennedy, deceased former president 
of the United States of America. would be the uh

27:08.958 --> 27:32.738
most logical of any people and for the reasons 
herein stipulated to have entered into a

27:08.958 --> 27:32.738
conspiracy to have uh committed this offense okay 
it's 5 40 5 40 p.m on march the 12th 1980 and the

27:08.958 --> 27:32.738
interview has been the interview is completed

27:37.375 --> 27:43.661
Today is March 13, 1980, and I'm just making this a 
follow-up note so that I don't forget on myself.

27:45.943 --> 28:02.440
When I spoke with a man earlier, when I had spoken 
with the man the day before and I had talked to him

27:45.943 --> 28:02.440
earlier, he had said that Ruby had not enough 
control to outvote or at least cause the redirect

27:45.943 --> 28:02.440
in certain policies or principles in the Dallas 
police station. Special notes to check. Why? had

28:07.177 --> 28:17.249
Jack Ruby, whom was a strip joint operator, been so 
close to the Dallas Police Department. Also, on my

28:17.269 --> 28:33.049
initial interview, which was not recorded, which 
was the day before this original recording, I had

28:17.269 --> 28:33.049
been told that Johnson had instructed the 
motorcade route to be changed, and that that

28:34.582 --> 28:47.376
Mr. Evans had been defaulted this information by 
and that Kennedy was only notified at the very last

28:34.582 --> 28:47.376
moment and was The only reason that he went along 
with this is because Johnson said that Johnson had

28:47.660 --> 29:09.313
said or is reported to have conveniently talked 
him into that this change would be more

28:47.660 --> 29:09.313
politically profitable. Special notes, which 
I'd like to make, just special notes, is

29:11.352 --> 29:40.043
Connolly's refusal to pardon Oswell, that 
Sanchez, who was the sheriff of Starr County, Coke

29:11.352 --> 29:40.043
Stevenson, Truman's pardon of par, Al Smith in 28, 
and it has not been mentioned, but it had been

29:11.352 --> 29:40.043
mentioned by Conley that

29:41.238 --> 29:47.965
Kennedy's trip to Texas was dangerous.

29:51.069 --> 30:06.486
Also, other points to note is why would Johnson 
accept the vice presidential nomination at the

29:51.069 --> 30:06.486
time he was Speaker at the House when the Speaker of 
the House is undisputedly considered to have more

30:06.820 --> 30:18.472
authority or at least more of being in a position of 
persuasion if not his motives have been for more

30:06.820 --> 30:18.472
power. Another point that I'd like to remember to 
investigate is did Ruby Clifton stop in between

30:19.994 --> 30:33.368
Mexico and why have none of the reports dealt with 
if he has or if he hasn't. I'll say a note. General

30:38.319 --> 30:39.520
Walker. I want to find out more about him. I was 
told, and I don't remember if this was on tape, that

30:43.143 --> 30:50.650
there was an attempt on his life. A bullet hole went 
through his window and nearly missed him. This is

30:54.534 --> 30:55.875
publicly acknowledged. It can be found in most 
periodicals. One other part that wasn't recorded

31:00.059 --> 31:04.823
that I've seen in my notes that parr is indebted to 
lbj for 10 years of his life or there was in in

31:06.220 --> 31:35.586
reference to that i suppose that the alleged 
assassination conspiracy would have wiped out

31:06.220 --> 31:35.586
the debt uh also i cannot recollect correctly but 
there was some mention about the gun about

31:35.752 --> 31:50.201
Oswald's gun having not been in normal

31:35.752 --> 31:50.201
custody after his apprehension for a couple of 
hours. These couple of hours are lagging time,

31:51.142 --> 31:57.996
which are a point that needs to be investigated.

32:00.743 --> 32:20.905
Nearly all the information on this tape is of 
course public knowledge and is the experience of

32:00.743 --> 32:20.905
one man who I consider to be of extremely high 
intelligence.

32:20.925 --> 32:28.894
The fact that he has presented, he has presented 
well and he has at all times adhered to his police

32:30.157 --> 32:58.965
mentality and police and prejudice and of using 
alleged and possible and probable and certain

32:30.157 --> 32:58.965
things are not common procedure conclusion mr. 
John B Evans has granted me the right to use any and

32:30.157 --> 32:58.965
every part of this interview for my research I 
realize this interview does not bring to light any

32:59.823 --> 33:15.553
new evidence, but it does express some motives and 
circumstances that, in my opinion, deserve to be

32:59.823 --> 33:15.553
researched.
