WEBVTT

00:01.840 --> 00:11.280
12, 1980, and Tommy Suarez of 5010 Oak Shadows is 
here, and he's listening to everything that's

00:01.840 --> 00:11.280
been said. Have you in any way been coerced into 
saying anything, or are you saying this

00:11.780 --> 00:19.910
completely on your own? It's my own free will, and 
it's my firm belief, and have been since the day of

00:20.750 --> 00:29.840
the assassination in 1963. Okay. We can keep 
going. You

00:33.960 --> 00:48.370
were telling me yesterday that, and I can't 
remember because when I went back to the house, I

00:33.960 --> 00:48.370
wrote some notes down, but I couldn't remember 
all. There was something that you had said that had

00:48.690 --> 00:55.690
been deleted from the Warren Commission and all 
the other investigations.

00:59.500 --> 01:06.410
The bulk of that investigation has been sealed. 
And

01:06.410 --> 01:17.430
I believe a period of time was set at 80 years before 
it would ever be opened and displayed to the

01:06.410 --> 01:17.430
public. And

01:17.410 --> 01:39.890
if you can believe what you see on television and 
read in the news, hear on radio, certain

01:17.410 --> 01:39.890
individuals who

01:17.410 --> 01:39.890
believe there was more than one gunman involved, 
and who have played back. We have recorded

01:45.820 --> 02:21.200
portions of the incident, some of which were 
supposed to have been recorded at Dallas Police

01:45.820 --> 02:21.200
Headquarters and their dispatching mechanism 
put on tape because of a mobile unit's microphone

01:45.820 --> 02:21.200
on the motorcycle of one of the Dallas police 
officers who was riding escort. There was, what

02:23.610 --> 02:54.600
were shots fired and had been stipulated in the 
various reports, and that some witnesses have

02:23.610 --> 02:54.600
claimed that there was a

02:23.610 --> 02:54.600
visual evidence to them of additional gunfire 
from a knoll long near the book storage building. I

02:54.580 --> 03:00.360
believe this knoll would have been a little bit 
southwest of the... some of the... ...southwest

03:00.880 --> 03:02.521
corner of the building, and would have been 
northwest of the path of the automobile the

03:09.880 --> 03:14.080
President and the Vice President were riding in. I

03:14.060 --> 03:25.150
was watching this mother cave proceed through 
Dallas on television, live, at the time of the

03:25.130 --> 03:29.800
assassination occurred.

03:32.970 --> 03:36.250
But through that media, I was not able to adhere to 
anything that I could discuss. ary雨

03:40.890 --> 03:54.860
However, in the transfer from the Dallas Police 
Station to the Dallas County Jail, which was

03:54.840 --> 04:01.690
attempted on Sunday morning, once again I was 
watching that live on television, and I did hear

04:01.670 --> 04:13.880
the report of firearms or a reasonable facsimile 
thereof at the incident that Jack Rudy

04:13.860 --> 04:28.630
surged towards Lee Harvey Oswald, and Oswald 
folded over and grasped his midriff, and then

04:28.610 --> 04:39.770
reportedly died,

04:28.610 --> 04:39.770
practically in the arms of a police captain. And I 
did distinctly hear that police captain say,

04:45.240 --> 04:53.090
Jack, you son of a bitch, to Jack Rudy. Is it common 
procedure for, for, when they're escorting

04:56.070 --> 05:02.090
somebody, for, for a policeman not to be in front of 
the person that they're escorting out? Proper

05:05.860 --> 05:17.250
procedure for a police officer or anybody else to 
escort a prisoner, party that has control of the

05:17.230 --> 05:27.650
prisoner, walks behind the prisoner.

05:27.630 --> 05:34.950
In this kind of situation that's transpired 
there, there was numerous police officers of all

05:34.930 --> 05:35.951
categories. All around, Lee Harvey

05:35.930 --> 05:45.090
Oswald. Had it not been for the familiar sight of 
Jack Rudy around the Dallas Police Station over

05:51.800 --> 05:59.140
the period of a couple of three months prior to this 
occurrence, Rudy would never have been able to

05:59.120 --> 06:09.920
even gotten on the grounds.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.920
Yeah, I see, I see that. But, and my question is, do 
you consider it to have been proper procedure the

06:11.900 --> 06:17.920
way that they were escorting him out? Nothing 
wrong with the procedure that they were using to

06:19.900 --> 06:23.920
escort him. Their belief was that everybody had 
been okay to be there and screened, and were not any

06:27.900 --> 06:33.100
threat to the life of the prisoner at all. He was 
being properly escorted with the captain of the

06:33.080 --> 06:40.780
police

06:33.080 --> 06:40.780
on one side of him and the, some other police 
official on the other side, a commissioned peace

06:40.760 --> 06:49.110
officer. And they each had ahold of an arm. That 
captain had a hold of Oswald's right arm and some

06:52.760 --> 06:59.780
other individual had his left arm and they were 
walking the captain just to his, barely to his

06:59.760 --> 07:06.570
right rear, almost the rest of him and the other 
officer in a similar position on the left side. It

07:11.860 --> 07:21.580
wasn't a matter of not having sufficient numbers 
of security operating in a firm belief that they

07:21.560 --> 07:25.580
had screened everybody and that there was nobody 
that would be any threat to the prisoner

07:25.560 --> 07:34.100
present. I can't fault the, the Dallas Police 
Department on this thing at all,

07:34.080 --> 07:49.450
but insofar as their methods they were using to 
transport him, that I would be somewhat tempted to

07:49.430 --> 07:59.230
criticize the news media because

07:59.210 --> 08:07.370
in the book that the chief police at that time, the 
Dallas Police wrote on the subject, he was

08:07.350 --> 08:19.780
somewhat coerced by the news media,

08:07.350 --> 08:19.780
which can unseat just about any individual from 
any public office that they decide to, including

08:19.760 --> 08:25.660
any president in the United States. With such 
action, if he didn't have this thing in the daytime

08:27.640 --> 08:34.810
where the majority of people would be able to watch 
it going on on television, live, at the burst of

08:34.790 --> 08:42.880
between two and four o'clock a.m. when 
practically everybody would be in bed asleep and

08:42.860 --> 08:48.900
nobody much would be watching it live on 
television. As a matter of fact, at that time, the

08:50.880 --> 08:59.360
local television stations here didn't even 
operate at that time of the morning. They shut

09:01.340 --> 09:05.900
down. Some of them don't now. They leave the airs 
around one o'clock, one thirty. I don't think any

09:12.600 --> 09:18.730
of them stay all night and still have a shut-down 
period of sometimes a week or two. I don't think any

09:19.710 --> 09:20.731
of them do. Okay. Can you give me any information on 
this General Walker that you spoke of earlier? He

09:26.710 --> 09:31.730
was, after he had retired, he had become... He 
retired from where? From the military army. He

09:35.710 --> 09:47.650
retired, I believe, a major general and was very 
active in the field politics and the Democrat

09:47.630 --> 09:51.370
party. I don't even recall what his first name or 
initials was. But

09:55.350 --> 10:13.080
I refuse to concede the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald 
was a spy for the Soviet Union because a spy for the

10:13.060 --> 10:20.580
Soviet Union would not make a point to go and marry a 
Russian woman and bring her to live in Dallas,

10:20.560 --> 10:24.730
Texas. He was trying to be a spy, give her a complete 
flop because she didn't have his cover blow before

10:31.750 --> 10:32.771
he ever started. And a spy with no cover is no spy. 
Yeah. I understand that. By what I understand,

10:37.960 --> 10:38.981
that's what you're saying. under that close of 
surveillance. I mean, he was in Dallas somewhere.

10:41.960 --> 10:42.981
You could undoubtedly have found him. Would be a 
problem. He was a good guy. He was a good guy. He was a

10:45.960 --> 10:46.981
good guy. He was a good guy. He was a good guy. He was a 
good guy. He was a good guy. He was a good guy. He was a

10:51.960 --> 10:52.981
good guy. He was a good guy. He was a good guy. He was a 
good guy. He was a good guy. He was a good guy. He was a

11:00.200 --> 11:01.221
good guy. Well, they knew where he was. He was in 
Dallas somewhere. And could undoubtedly have

11:03.510 --> 11:05.350
found him. Would be a big problem. Seemed like to 
find his wife, family, and all that after the thing

11:06.330 --> 11:08.350
happened. They didn't? They did. Yeah. Okay. Not 
only found them, but also found that, that, that he

11:12.390 --> 11:22.580
was the breadwinner for a place to live for he and 
his wife. And Dallas, and for Dallas. that he had

11:27.560 --> 11:28.581
lived in. Living in Dallas. Fort Worth, mother in 
Dallas or vice versa. He's keeping up both homes.

11:37.518 --> 11:37.940
And while he was looking all this around to Mexico 
City and back, he wasn't supposed to even have a

11:37.920 --> 11:41.880
job, period. No end in time. Nobody knew that at 
all. He was financing living some kind of way.

11:52.798 --> 11:56.580
Of course, they claimed they checked this all out 
and that he had sufficient funds coming in from

11:56.560 --> 11:58.410
some source. I never did know where to have done 
this all. And it has never been clear in my mind what

12:03.640 --> 12:10.857
mode of transportation he used to get to Mexico 
City. Nobody ever mentioned that. He drove down

12:12.545 --> 12:14.533
there, walked, hitchhiked. How did he get there? 
On a bus? He didn't go on a train, but he went across

12:19.210 --> 12:24.974
the river and that Roma he had. He didn't have 
anything for a train to go to Roma about. Nothing

12:30.262 --> 12:30.946
there. He didn't need to transport on a train. He 
didn't produce anything. It was a rocky area

12:37.990 --> 12:43.981
around there, a little village there on the river.

12:44.926 --> 12:45.690
No city on the opposite side of Mexico. It was the 
window town or whatever it was then. The nearest

12:50.550 --> 13:01.810
place after you got over there was San Pedro,

12:50.550 --> 13:01.810
and it was about the same size as Umber was. It was 
nothing to get to. It was pretty good size of a town

13:06.670 --> 13:12.410
now, but it sure wasn't in 1963. Well, you... Yes. 
When you said that you served in the service from

13:16.330 --> 13:22.080
the years of, could you repeat that again? When I 
was in the military? Right. From August the 7th,

13:25.831 --> 13:30.420
1940 to July 28th, 1945. And what was your rank in 
the military? Highest rank in the health, and I was

13:33.400 --> 13:38.250
sergeant. I did attend the officer candidate 
school and resigned out of it the day before I was to

13:38.230 --> 13:50.260
be commissioned as a personnel

13:38.230 --> 13:50.260
leader. Did you say that you know, or that, I don't 
know, that relations or something like that in

13:50.240 --> 13:58.260
Starr County? Did you know somebody who lived in 
Starr County? I, while I was stationed there, the

14:03.330 --> 14:23.190
only somebody that I ever knew there at that time, 
the city marshal there, a fellow by the name of

14:03.330 --> 14:23.190
Sanchez, 1941. I was real well known. I went with 
him. I knew him. I talked to him a few times. I know a

14:29.170 --> 14:35.150
lot of people there. I know that the information 
has been that there was a great influx of, in recent

14:35.130 --> 14:47.270
years, a great influx of illegal drugs of various 
kinds, marijuana, I don't know what the hash is,

14:47.250 --> 14:55.340
heroin, bag of tricks. It was coming through 
there. Some people built some malls for pretty

14:58.320 --> 15:01.340
homes. At least that's what they showed to be on the 
television. I don't know. A place that didn't

15:05.400 --> 15:07.420
produce anything. They were buying homes out 
there anyway. I don't know where they were getting

15:11.640 --> 15:13.660
their money from. Oil there. Great shakes for 
grazing cattle. Probably that area right along

15:19.890 --> 15:24.160
there where those homes were. Fifty acres might 
support a

15:24.140 --> 15:29.810
cattle. Maybe. Of course, you never had any hard 
winter that would support them any time. They

15:35.830 --> 15:37.850
weren't supposed to be around. But it takes so many 
acres to do it. I doubt anybody had that many in that

15:39.830 --> 15:43.970
area. There's a lot of very fine homes built all 
along that road between them for several miles,

15:50.950 --> 15:58.390
right up at the edge of Star County, towards 
Mission, which would be east of Riverview City. I

15:58.370 --> 16:04.470
showed these pictures and highway numbers and all 
this stuff right there, along the north of the road

16:04.450 --> 16:07.500
where the, what they called the Skeet Specials 
railroad tracks ran south of the highway. These

16:13.480 --> 16:15.500
houses seemed to be off. Actually, I wasn't on the 
north side of the road with much of anything. And

16:19.980 --> 16:31.560
certainly nothing but brush from there back to the 
banks of the Rio Grande. Army

16:31.540 --> 16:38.560
posts there, full green roads right on the banks of 
the Rio Grande. Can you tell me, from the time that

16:38.540 --> 16:42.560
you started, into your police career, as to where 
all you have been, you have worked for, for what

16:48.540 --> 16:54.000
police, for what police agencies you have worked 
for? What police stations? Or, since you have

16:55.980 --> 17:00.000
retired, since you got out of the military, have 
you always been to the police force? Right. And can

17:03.852 --> 17:06.000
you, can you tell me what the police force? I was 
discharged on a Friday, July the 28th, 1945,

17:13.030 --> 17:14.040
Monday morning. I went down and answered to an ad in 
the local paper and applied for a job at the Houston

17:17.030 --> 17:20.050
Police Department. And on the 13th day of August, I 
was called to the station and sworn in as a police

17:23.080 --> 17:27.900
officer and given an assignment to work the VJ day 
for

17:27.880 --> 17:38.860
a... And so you have always, so the police agency 
that you have always worked with has been HPD. Have

17:45.220 --> 17:50.650
you ever seen any material, any confidential 
material that has dealt with, with any

17:50.630 --> 17:58.600
Kennedy-related material? I don't recall... 
Without divulging any, you know... Any written

18:03.080 --> 18:08.100
material or anything pertaining to this 
assassination? That is not, that's not public?

18:14.950 --> 18:16.970
We had nothing in our files. I had access to any 
files. We

18:18.950 --> 18:28.400
had nothing to investigate, to make any files. As

18:28.380 --> 18:31.920
far as I know... As far as I know, other than the 
possibility that he may have passed through some

18:31.900 --> 18:38.920
time, Leo, Leo McDonnell's father was ever in 
Houston. I don't remember that. You said you...

18:46.640 --> 18:49.660
John Kennedy was here during that same period. He 
was here when they were campaigning for the

18:49.640 --> 18:55.610
presidency. And then he was here during that time. 
And then Johnson was here after he was president. I

19:02.030 --> 19:06.050
went out to Hobby Airport on St. Clair National 
Airport. And was part of the police security out

19:06.030 --> 19:14.580
there. He and Lady Bird came down. He was Humphrey 
and his wife came with them. You have told me that

19:23.310 --> 19:31.330
LBJ was not in the same car with Kennedy or Conley. 
And that was perfect. Kennedy and Conley was in the

19:33.310 --> 19:35.330
same car. But as the motorcades went by on 
television, there was the car they were in. And

19:42.230 --> 19:48.640
then the

19:42.230 --> 19:48.640
president lurched back like this in the seat. And 
it seemed like John Conley lurched over this way at

19:48.620 --> 19:59.450
the same time and came down. And

19:59.430 --> 20:13.500
Jackie Kennedy crawled over the back seat and back 
on the trunk of the open car. And it seemed big. And

20:16.170 --> 20:24.660
it seemed to be trying to do something for the 
president and the Secret Service. And running

20:24.640 --> 20:31.690
along behind, at least one of them climbed up on the 
trunk. Somebody

20:31.670 --> 20:38.170
gave some kind of signal and took off. And they took 
off. And there was the space between that car and

20:39.150 --> 20:47.170
the one that Johnson and Lady Bird was in. It was at 
least as far as from here across the street. Do you,

20:52.070 --> 21:07.350
is it your assumption

20:52.070 --> 21:07.350
that Conley, do you think that Conley and Kennedy 
were riding together because Conley had more

21:07.330 --> 21:11.350
prestige than Johnson? And that it would be more of 
a good of an appearance for them to be riding

21:11.330 --> 21:17.350
together? No, I think it was strictly a matter of 
protocol. Chief Executive of the nation. He was a

21:23.330 --> 21:27.410
guest of the chief executive of the state. The same 
token that the lieutenant governor would have

21:27.390 --> 21:37.120
been placed in a different car. Two of them had gone 
to Washington to see the president. That's

21:40.100 --> 21:42.120
something they drove around. The governor and his 
wife was in the car with the president. His wife was

21:47.250 --> 21:50.270
the vice president then. While

21:50.250 --> 22:00.220
in the military, have you, did you receive any, any 
kind of commemoration in the military?

22:06.080 --> 22:11.183
Commendations?

22:11.263 --> 22:12.870
Special, special work. Decorations or anything. 
Right.

22:16.884 --> 22:20.180
Not particularly just theater and combat. And

22:20.160 --> 22:30.890
I did receive a certificate of appreciation, a 
half-h arm of the lieutenant general of the United

22:30.870 --> 22:36.350
States Air Force. And while you had been on the 
Houston police force, did you ever receive any

22:39.330 --> 22:43.350
commendation while you were on there? Did you 
receive any kind of commendation from the Houston

22:43.330 --> 22:48.860
police before a pardon? Nothing more than letters 
of commendation. A bunch of them. Two or one of

22:53.840 --> 22:56.780
them. Yesterday you said you had some

22:56.760 --> 23:02.310
kind, a whole wall full of, There they are. Okay. 
Okay. I want to interrupt. I'm going to interrupt

23:11.350 --> 23:13.370
this for one moment. Let me, let me say this before 
we shut this off. What I have stated here is my

23:18.660 --> 23:31.730
opinion and is a result of my own

23:18.660 --> 23:31.730
investigation as best as I could

23:31.710 --> 23:40.660
go through with in this case. But it appears to me 
that I have established a motive for each of the

23:44.640 --> 23:46.660
individuals, I have named as probable 
conspirators in this incident. The motive of

23:54.480 --> 23:59.650
Lyndon Baines Johnson being, wanting

23:59.630 --> 24:07.280
to be president of the United States. George Parr 
trying to pay, repay Johnson for procuring

24:11.180 --> 24:16.540
presidential pardons for some 20 years of his 
life. Lee Harvey Oswald, trying to get the

24:22.760 --> 24:25.780
opportunity of revenge against John Connolly and 
Jack Ruby is strictly religiously motivated in

24:25.760 --> 24:30.480
him. Okay. Everything that you have said right 
now, we discussed yesterday, and I asked your

24:36.460 --> 24:39.480
permission if you would be recorded. And nothing 
that we have said, nothing that has been said

24:43.460 --> 24:45.480
today, has been pre-planned out to say. And you 
have held, you told me this yesterday that this has

24:50.680 --> 24:52.700
been your opinion. And I have come up with to you to 
no motive, asking with no knowledge of my own. And I

25:03.730 --> 25:05.750
am just trying to find out, I just want to learn your 
opinion. Is that correct? Right. And I have

25:10.681 --> 25:14.100
expressed this same opinion for the same reasons 
to lots of people over the years. I fully expect to

25:16.080 --> 25:19.220
express it to some more. Okay. Nobody ever. Nobody 
ever promised me anything. Okay. Tommy Suarez.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.220
This is Tommy Suarez. And he has been sitting here 
through the entire interview on both sides of the

25:34.200 --> 25:36.220
tapes. And he has listened to both sides of the 
tapes. And have we stopped? Have we stopped or have

25:40.200 --> 25:43.220
we edited anything in any way? No. No. No, I am 
saying, have we stopped or have we edited

25:47.120 --> 25:49.140
anything? No. Okay. Okay. Right now I am going to 
cut this off because I want to go see what he was

25:54.120 --> 25:58.140
telling me about about what you have on your wall. 
And we will resume the cinema. You are lying. I am

26:05.120 --> 26:06.141
sorry. Everything that you said today, we have not 
deleted anything out of this tape. And I have taken

26:11.120 --> 26:17.740
pictures of the documents that I said I was going to 
take pictures of and we are now concluding the

26:19.720 --> 26:22.740
interview. Is there anything left that you would 
like to say? Nothing

26:24.720 --> 26:32.660
more than that I have formulated my opinion from 
the evidence that I had at hand and through

26:37.300 --> 26:41.440
application thereof to the rules of the criminal 
investigation and have arrived at the conclusion

26:50.400 --> 26:55.740
that the parties named herein as members of 
conspiracy in the assassination of John Ford,

26:58.120 --> 27:00.140
John Fitzgerald Kennedy, deceased

27:00.120 --> 27:06.450
former President of the United States of America, 
would be the most logical of any people and for the

27:12.660 --> 27:15.680
reasons herein stipulated to have entered into a 
conspiracy to have committed this offense. Okay.

27:25.128 --> 27:29.200
It is 5.40 p.m. on March 12, 1980 and the interview 
has been completed.

27:37.110 --> 27:39.130
Today is March 13, 1980 and I am just making this a 
follow-up note so that I don't forget on myself.

27:44.110 --> 27:47.600
When I spoke with the man earlier, when I had spoken 
with the man the day before and I had talked to him

27:49.580 --> 27:51.600
earlier, he had said that Ruby had not enough 
control to outvote or at least to cause the

27:54.580 --> 27:57.600
redirect in certain policies or principles in the 
Dallas police station. Special notes to check.

28:05.670 --> 28:06.238
Why? Had Jack Ruby, whom was a strip joint 
operator, been so close to the Dallas police

28:11.980 --> 28:16.000
department? Also, on my initial interview, which 
was not recorded, which was the day before this

28:20.450 --> 28:24.850
original recording, I had been told that Johnson 
had instructed the motorcade route to be changed

28:31.830 --> 28:35.480
and that Mr. Excuse me for the interruption. But 
that Mr. Evans had been devoted this information

28:38.460 --> 28:41.480
by and that Kennedy was only notified at the very 
last moment and was the only reason that he went

28:45.800 --> 28:49.820
along with this because Johnson said that it, 
Johnson had said or is reported to have

28:59.080 --> 29:03.100
conveniently talked him into that this change 
would be more politically profitable.

29:11.501 --> 29:13.490
Special notes which I'd like to make, just special 
notes, is Connelly's refusal to pardon Oswell,

29:20.320 --> 29:25.500
that Sanchez, who was the sheriff of Starr County, 
Coke Stevenson, Truman's pardon of par, Al Smith

29:31.320 --> 29:34.820
in 28, and it has not been mentioned, but it had been 
mentioned by Connelly that Kennedy's trip to

29:41.740 --> 29:50.860
Texas was dangerous.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.860
Also, other points to note is why would Johnson 
accept the vice presidential nomination at the

29:56.840 --> 29:59.860
time he was Speaker at the House when the Speaker of 
the House is undisputedly considered to have more

30:05.840 --> 30:07.860
authority or at least more of being in a position of 
persuasion if not his motives have been for more

30:12.840 --> 30:18.980
power. Another point that I'd like to remember to 
investigate is did Ruby Clifton stop in between

30:24.270 --> 30:28.080
Mexico and why have none of the reports dealt with 
if he has or if he hasn't. Also note, General

30:34.600 --> 30:40.060
Walker, I want to find out more about him. I was told 
and I don't remember if this was on on tape that

30:44.920 --> 30:50.940
there was an attempt on his life. A bullet hole went 
through his window and nearly missed him. This is

30:54.920 --> 30:55.941
publicly acknowledged can be found in most 
periodicals. One other part that wasn't recorded

31:01.920 --> 31:04.940
that I've seen in my notes that par is indebted to 
LBJ for 10 years of his life or there was and in

31:13.640 --> 31:15.900
reference to that, I suppose that the alleged 
assassination conspiracy would have wiped out

31:24.660 --> 31:26.680
the debt. Also, I cannot recollect correctly, but 
there was some mention about Oswald's

31:33.160 --> 31:40.430
gun having not been in

31:40.410 --> 31:45.530
normal custody after his apprehension for a 
couple of hours. These couple of hours are lagging

31:52.510 --> 31:54.620
time which is a point that needs to be 
investigated. Nearly

31:57.600 --> 32:03.140
all the information on this tape is of course 
public knowledge and is the experience of one man

32:11.810 --> 32:14.830
who I consider to be of extremely high 
intelligence. The

32:17.810 --> 32:21.940
fact that he is presented he is presented well and 
he has at all times adhered to his police mentality

32:36.140 --> 32:38.160
and police and prejudice of using alleged and 
possible and probable and that certain things are

32:48.260 --> 32:50.280
not common procedure. Conclusion. Mr. John B. 
Evans has granted me the right to use any and every

32:55.260 --> 32:57.280
part of this interview for my research. I realize 
that this interview does not bring to light any new

33:04.280 --> 33:06.300
evidence but it does express some motives and 
circumstances that in my opinion deserve to be

33:13.310 --> 33:15.330
researched.
