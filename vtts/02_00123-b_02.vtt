WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:19.728
There were a lot of German school and a lot of Czech.

00:20.709 --> 00:26.094
Did you go to, do you remember going early to Silver Taps?

00:27.876 --> 00:30.439
I remember going to them, yes.

00:30.999 --> 00:31.860
What was it like?

00:32.566 --> 00:38.571
Well it was a solemn occasion, a reverent occasion.

00:41.894 --> 00:52.784
No laughing or frivolity or anything of that sort.

00:52.944 --> 01:01.712
It was there to recognize students who had died since the last year.

01:02.418 --> 01:04.600
Occasionally have taps of the last year.

01:07.843 --> 01:11.186
On a lighter side, did you go to ill practice?

01:14.229 --> 01:15.210
Very seldom.

01:15.330 --> 01:20.855
I went to a few ill practices and a few midnight ill practices.

01:20.875 --> 01:21.656
What about muster?

01:22.657 --> 01:24.499
Yes, yes.

01:24.519 --> 01:25.400
Where was it held?

01:26.080 --> 01:28.483
Guy and Hall, usually.

01:28.503 --> 01:30.184
And was that a serious?

01:30.665 --> 01:31.125
Yes.

01:33.721 --> 01:37.605
You hadn't heard of muster before you got to A&M, though?

01:39.007 --> 01:39.067
No.

01:39.087 --> 01:39.187
Okay.

01:39.207 --> 01:49.578
In general, the people that had gone to A&M before World War II, they have to kind of search to remember whether they went to muster or not.

01:50.159 --> 01:53.963
Apparently, World War II changed muster very, very much.

01:54.444 --> 01:54.844
I see.

01:55.605 --> 01:58.789
What was bonfire like in your student days?

02:00.250 --> 02:02.833
Well, the...

02:03.809 --> 02:19.128
It evolved considerably during the years that I was there, not to anything like the last bonfire that collapsed a few years before.

02:21.571 --> 02:25.676
It started out as almost a pile of trash.

02:28.179 --> 02:32.685
The next evolution of it was

02:34.505 --> 02:41.482
was logs that were cut, but I'd call it a teepee style log.

02:41.502 --> 02:52.227
And I don't know that even up to my last bonfire in 53 that it had ever arrived at a tiered

02:53.573 --> 02:55.777
And it was held on the drill field?

02:55.937 --> 02:59.664
Yeah, probably in that city.

03:00.525 --> 03:10.984
Now, on the campus also, there were veterans housing down south of Kyle Field, and the old project houses were there.

03:11.224 --> 03:14.991
Yeah.

03:16.675 --> 03:26.470
Let's see, when you went back and forth from the campus, y'all went in your own car, so you never did have to hitchhike or anything like that.

03:26.530 --> 03:31.919
Did you ever hear any bad hitchhiking experience?

03:31.939 --> 03:32.580
I have not.

03:33.721 --> 03:34.222
No, no.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.506
Nothing but positive.

03:36.726 --> 03:38.489
That's right.

03:38.869 --> 03:40.632
Did you travel by train ever?

03:41.313 --> 03:45.079
Yes, a few times I went to Houston.

03:45.852 --> 03:47.734
Yeah, go to Houston on the train.

03:47.975 --> 03:51.259
And the train, there were a number of passenger trains every day.

03:51.279 --> 03:51.619
Oh, yeah.

03:51.639 --> 03:58.408
Yeah, there were at least two trains a day, one in morning, one in the evening or at night.

04:00.210 --> 04:03.575
What were Aggies, what were their indulgences then?

04:03.695 --> 04:07.940
What were Aggies smoking?

04:07.960 --> 04:10.003
Well, of course, the majority of

04:10.793 --> 04:16.200
Grown people, young men I guess smoked at that time cigarettes.

04:16.580 --> 04:17.341
And what brands?

04:21.266 --> 04:24.310
Probably Camels, Lucky Strikes, Chesterfield.

04:26.493 --> 04:29.497
And did many people smoke cigars?

04:30.278 --> 04:30.478
No.

04:31.499 --> 04:31.719
Pipes?

04:33.241 --> 04:33.782
Not many.

04:34.683 --> 04:37.847
And do you remember any students that roll their own?

04:39.920 --> 04:41.481
There might have been a few.

04:41.602 --> 04:43.163
I don't recall any.

04:43.183 --> 04:46.666
I know there were people in those times that did.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.428
Snuff, chewing tobacco?

04:49.429 --> 04:50.610
Some chewing tobacco.

04:52.632 --> 04:55.875
I don't recall any students that used snuff.

04:56.476 --> 04:58.718
Maybe one or two would use Copenhagen.

04:59.178 --> 05:03.042
Had you even heard of marijuana?

05:03.062 --> 05:04.683
Yes, yes.

05:04.703 --> 05:07.606
In fact I was acquainted with marijuana.

05:07.906 --> 05:08.627
How so?

05:11.189 --> 05:37.146
When we lived on the farm out there there was about six Mexican families and about six black families that lived out there, and they did most of the cotton shopping and labor and whatnot, and on Fridays I'd come in from

05:38.071 --> 05:42.837
usually saddle a horse and ride off down in the field just to have something to do.

05:44.039 --> 06:05.327
One spring day I went down to what we call a mountain cut, which was a field that we always raised corn on that had a steep hillside on it, kind of almost like a butte.

06:08.193 --> 06:18.466
When I got, I rolled up to the edge of the field and there must have been ten hands out there in a row chopping corn.

06:18.486 --> 06:25.114
And they were all singing and stepping high like they were stepping over something.

06:27.236 --> 06:31.922
Andrew, one of the Hispanics was down at the end of the road.

06:40.643 --> 06:42.125
He says they've got some marijuana.

06:45.831 --> 06:47.273
Do you know where did they get it?

06:47.734 --> 06:48.135
Raised it.

06:48.736 --> 06:50.578
Oh, okay.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.484
And I would notice from time to time.

06:55.306 --> 06:59.072
But now you never heard, when you were a student, you sure didn't hear of it here.

07:00.975 --> 07:02.817
What were Aggies drinking then?

07:03.639 --> 07:04.320
Beer mostly.

07:04.560 --> 07:05.201
Where did they get it?

07:07.565 --> 07:09.047
Hard liquors down there.

07:09.584 --> 07:12.888
Did you ever describe Mr. Hardlaker's place?

07:14.109 --> 07:36.254
Oh, it was a big Barney-like structure down there that had tables about the size of a card table, and it would be anywhere from two dozen people, and sometimes they'd pull these tables together and make big long tables on it.

07:37.196 --> 07:39.338
Most of the, as I recall, most of the

07:40.955 --> 07:44.140
people dispensing the beer were men.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.685
I don't remember any women.

07:47.586 --> 07:54.458
And that was located about where Holloman intersects Welburn Road?

07:54.598 --> 07:58.725
Yeah, or a little bit back towards Tampa.

07:59.346 --> 08:02.071
Now could you buy anything stronger than beer in there?

08:02.812 --> 08:03.874
No, no.

08:05.238 --> 08:09.525
And I've not heard of any other place near the campus where beer was sold.

08:09.805 --> 08:10.527
No.

08:10.547 --> 08:17.017
A little later on there was, it seemed like it was a barbecue place over on Texas Avenue.

08:17.057 --> 08:17.658
Arnold's.

08:18.119 --> 08:18.539
Arnold's.

08:18.559 --> 08:19.140
Yeah, later.

08:20.162 --> 08:21.985
Was Whiskey Bridge open then?

08:22.386 --> 08:25.571
Could you buy over and go into Snook?

08:25.811 --> 08:26.132
Yeah.

08:27.213 --> 08:27.574
Yeah.

08:28.555 --> 08:31.380
And then there was another,

08:31.715 --> 08:47.898
up at Highway 21, that's where the sort of free state of Burleson County was over there.

08:49.220 --> 08:52.525
There was a restaurant over there.

08:58.917 --> 09:08.271
There was nearly anything over there that you'd like to have or maybe something you didn't like.

09:08.291 --> 09:08.552
All right.

09:08.612 --> 09:14.621
Now, when you were here, women were allowed to go to class in the summer.

09:14.641 --> 09:15.162
That's right.

09:15.863 --> 09:18.647
And what did you all think about those co-eds?

09:20.871 --> 09:25.077
I never did have a problem with it or, and of course the faculty,

09:25.867 --> 09:29.754
Children could go to school during the regular semester.

09:29.774 --> 09:35.485
Now, I don't think a whole lot of them did, but a few of them did.

09:35.505 --> 09:46.266
And many of those summer school women were student wives, and nobody picked on them, did they?

09:46.666 --> 09:46.987
No.

09:47.248 --> 09:48.550
No, I think they all.

09:49.846 --> 10:00.136
were very respectful of them, and I think a whole lot of them were connected with the teaching profession where they go in and get something.

10:00.396 --> 10:02.859
While you were a student, the president was whom?

10:03.880 --> 10:04.560
A&M president.

10:08.284 --> 10:09.785
Jack Williams?

10:09.805 --> 10:10.326
No, no, no.

10:10.426 --> 10:11.587
That's 1970.

10:13.729 --> 10:16.051
Was this Gilchrist?

10:16.071 --> 10:16.832
Walton?

10:19.647 --> 10:21.109
It must have been Gibb Gilchrist.

10:21.129 --> 10:24.232
Bolton, Gibb Gilchrist.

10:24.572 --> 10:26.014
Did you students see him much?

10:27.496 --> 10:27.556
No.

10:27.576 --> 10:31.500
Now I got to know him pretty well, but that was only different.

10:31.660 --> 10:37.026
Oh, describe, I don't have anything in them, describe him as a person, personality and all.

10:38.268 --> 10:41.932
Of course he went on to be the head of the highway department.

10:42.312 --> 10:42.913
No, had been.

10:43.694 --> 10:44.535
Had been, yeah.

10:45.616 --> 10:49.300
But the way I got to know him was in the,

10:51.355 --> 11:10.677
late 50s I guess, it was the city of Puerto Vallarta had a big infrastructure improvement, mainly water and sewer and paving.

11:10.697 --> 11:16.384
And the contractor went broke and wound up suing the city.

11:18.170 --> 11:32.350
And the attorney for the contractor hired me to furnish him technical data for the lawsuit.

11:32.831 --> 11:38.559
And the lawsuit was tried before an arbitration board, one of whom was Gibb Gilchrist.

11:38.579 --> 11:40.161
One of the arbiters was Gibb.

11:46.013 --> 11:49.438
It wound up being a pretty big project.

11:49.498 --> 12:09.709
At one point in time, we had about 15 people down there working and I would get up and get crews going at daylight and then I'd start to go over to where the arbitration was and I'd stay with the arbiters

12:14.870 --> 12:26.882
when they quit in the afternoon and then I'd go back and we'd work nearly all night long sometimes getting exhibits and things ready for them.

12:26.902 --> 12:43.358
But Mr. Gilchrist was a, I thought a good engineer, he always asked what I thought were pertinent questions

12:43.945 --> 12:52.454
relative to the engineering part of it, either construction or design or something of this sort.

12:52.654 --> 12:57.019
And there was little, he was all business.

12:57.480 --> 13:01.504
Was he physically big man, small, good personality?

13:01.584 --> 13:05.989
Yes, yes.

13:06.209 --> 13:13.497
He asked plain, clear questions.

13:23.129 --> 13:25.051
He didn't argue with the answers.

13:25.492 --> 13:27.173
He told him what it was.

13:27.374 --> 13:32.099
In my case that's the way it was and I don't know.

13:34.181 --> 13:37.705
But I was questioned by him on many occasions.

13:38.146 --> 13:41.890
Now when he was president did you students think that he was in charge?

13:46.295 --> 13:51.060
Again I wasn't too involved in that.

13:53.673 --> 13:57.438
I really wasn't even concerned about who the president was or anything else.

13:57.518 --> 14:00.262
I was worried about when my next quiz was.

14:01.744 --> 14:07.753
And you and your wife, did you all begin to get involved in the community?

14:07.813 --> 14:08.634
Did you go to church?

14:09.675 --> 14:17.747
We went to First Baptist Church over at the Northgate, of course.

14:18.468 --> 14:20.811
Once in a while we'd go to the Methodist Church.

14:20.791 --> 14:25.338
At that point in time I was Methodist and she was Baptist.

14:26.039 --> 14:28.082
I have since joined the Baptist church.

14:28.943 --> 14:34.071
Did many students go to the Sunday services in that area?

14:34.091 --> 14:34.872
Yes, of course.

14:35.073 --> 14:44.487
At the beginning of the semester half of the congregation would be students and they would come over in big bunches.

14:44.635 --> 14:51.865
And there were always substantial numbers of students in the church services.

14:52.666 --> 14:58.214
Now where did, in that era, where did you all go to the grocery store?

14:58.234 --> 14:59.897
And the drug store and so forth?

15:01.078 --> 15:03.922
Lipscomb's Drug Store was over at the North Gate.

15:04.203 --> 15:04.523
Okay.

15:05.645 --> 15:12.955
There was a grocery store down at Texas Avenue and

15:13.188 --> 15:15.993
North Avenue, Wins Grocery Store.

15:16.635 --> 15:17.396
And then Ores.

15:18.638 --> 15:20.241
Ores further on down.

15:20.301 --> 15:35.871
But again, Rose always liked to shop at A&P and she'd go into town and shop at A&P.

15:36.830 --> 15:42.961
The campus community was a real community.

15:43.502 --> 15:46.326
What was there, how much was there south of campus?

15:46.647 --> 15:53.058
How far down south did the residential area go in 1951 or two?

15:53.098 --> 16:01.673
There was,

16:04.825 --> 16:15.302
Mays had a grocery store, a little grocery store over at what's now University Drive in Texas.

16:15.322 --> 16:21.112
The Gulf station is, was there then and still there.

16:21.652 --> 16:26.200
It's at the corner of University in Texas.

16:27.322 --> 16:30.647
The only, the next business going towards Bryan

16:31.133 --> 16:38.463
was Wynn's Grocery Store at North Avenue, and then there was nothing else that you got to go to drive.

16:38.523 --> 16:40.125
All right, but now go south of the campus.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.608
There was not any businesses.

16:42.628 --> 16:43.790
Maidley's Drug Store.

16:44.510 --> 16:46.173
Maidley's over here at Southside.

16:46.313 --> 16:46.874
Southside.

16:49.637 --> 16:51.760
I've got a luncheon engagement.

16:51.780 --> 16:59.470
But here south of Jersey Street, how far down did the residential area go?

17:02.909 --> 17:12.878
Well here, the next block down there was the end of purging and the end of any housing.

17:13.498 --> 17:23.728
From Park Place south or southeast was Swartz Farm which I subdivided later on.

17:24.789 --> 17:30.874
And these houses, some of these houses in this area were rather new weren't they?

17:33.470 --> 17:35.455
Hadn't some of them been built in the late 40s?

17:35.475 --> 17:45.939
As far as I know, this area right through here was all established.

17:46.099 --> 17:49.487
Now over here, a couple of blocks

17:50.277 --> 18:04.602
I guess on the glade timber, there are a few houses over there that Bill Fitch built about this time and you can recognize all of them by that low pitch route.

18:04.642 --> 18:10.632
And all of the A&M Consolidated School was on Jersey.

18:11.033 --> 18:14.839
That's right over here where Oakwood School is now.

18:14.859 --> 18:18.905
And the Lincoln School was down south.

18:19.106 --> 18:21.229
Yeah, where the Lincoln Center is now.

18:22.251 --> 18:29.102
And did, when you were a student, did you all feel comfortable?

18:29.743 --> 18:31.025
Did you like the community?

18:32.066 --> 18:34.750
Did you think of the people who lived here as pleasant?

18:35.552 --> 18:36.453
Yes, yes.

18:36.533 --> 18:38.897
We didn't have any...

18:40.042 --> 19:05.712
bad experience, there was at that point in time, I won't say animosity, but there were, there was a feeling when you went to Bryan that if you were from college, if you were a student from A&M, you could tend to your business and leave and they'd be just as happy.

19:07.565 --> 19:11.989
Well, let's see.

19:12.490 --> 19:16.754
Now just some kind of summary questions.

19:19.276 --> 19:22.880
Your senior ring, is that your first one?

19:23.581 --> 19:23.861
Yes, sir.

19:24.482 --> 19:25.382
How much did it cost?

19:30.247 --> 19:31.969
Seemed like fifty-something dollars.

19:31.989 --> 19:37.234
How did you feel when you put it on the first time?

19:38.345 --> 19:39.707
Inordinately proud.

19:42.791 --> 19:44.193
Do you have any ring stories?

19:44.273 --> 19:51.003
Have you ever lost it and somebody got it back to you or been on the other side of the world and somebody recognized an Aggie ring?

19:53.206 --> 19:59.495
Once in a while people will recognize it and still do.

19:59.756 --> 20:07.086
I lost the ring one time out here picking up leaves and cool

20:08.129 --> 20:12.938
winter day and it just came off my hand.

20:17.526 --> 20:22.535
I knew it had to be in those leaves somewhere or I strongly suspected it was.

20:24.098 --> 20:26.442
And I went over to Radio Shack

20:27.299 --> 20:40.174
bought a metal detector that would find gold and ginned it up and I had about 15 bags of leaves there and I started going through these bags and found them.

20:40.194 --> 20:44.219
Very good, very good.

20:44.239 --> 20:47.142
Why are Aggie rings so special?

20:47.262 --> 20:49.425
Why do Aggies care so much about their ring?

20:54.299 --> 20:55.260
I don't know.

20:55.280 --> 21:08.732
I suppose it represents a period of our lives when we felt like or feel like that there was an accomplishment there that was significant and worthwhile.

21:10.233 --> 21:11.954
And this is a symbol of that.

21:12.215 --> 21:13.416
And you're still proud of it.

21:13.616 --> 21:14.577
Yes, sir.

21:14.597 --> 21:18.240
Now you never, you didn't buy any senior boots because you weren't in the Corps.

21:19.401 --> 21:20.502
No, that's right.

21:20.522 --> 21:23.204
Did you ever go over to watch a final review?

21:23.525 --> 21:23.985
Yes.

21:25.163 --> 21:26.545
Is that a good ceremony?

21:26.805 --> 21:28.026
I think it is, yes.

21:30.128 --> 21:31.530
Commencement, where was it held?

21:32.131 --> 21:32.571
I don't know.

21:33.572 --> 21:34.053
Who came?

21:35.134 --> 21:35.795
Everybody.

21:37.457 --> 21:42.442
The freshmen, I mean the seniors and all their parents and friends.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.004
Did you have a lot of family come?

21:45.606 --> 21:49.590
My mother and dad, ours was in Kyle Field.

21:50.771 --> 21:52.133
Do you remember who the speaker was?

21:52.193 --> 21:53.314
Was anybody special?

21:55.353 --> 21:59.979
I made a speech to us over there.

21:59.999 --> 22:03.044
Oh great, good.

22:03.064 --> 22:04.526
I don't believe it was his senior.

22:05.026 --> 22:11.195
I don't think he spoke, but he came while you were, and everybody turned out.

22:11.315 --> 22:14.720
Yeah, yeah.

22:15.280 --> 22:18.745
When you got that diploma, how did you feel?

22:25.255 --> 22:45.998
Well, it's something that I set out to accomplish and did, and sometimes to this day it's hard for me to really, really understand and comprehend all the significance of that.

22:46.278 --> 22:52.765
And I guess people that have not experienced, there's not any way to explain it to them.

22:53.150 --> 22:56.775
But your name was called and your hand was shaken.

22:57.015 --> 22:57.536
That's right.

23:00.860 --> 23:05.546
What is it that creates this Aggie spirit, this pride?

23:12.915 --> 23:13.396
I don't know.

23:13.416 --> 23:19.984
I guess there is a common denominator here of

23:22.748 --> 23:46.073
everybody accomplishing or being subjected to the same set of circumstances and going through the same set of conditions in order to reach this particular goal.

23:46.113 --> 23:51.118
It's a common, it's a bonding thing that

23:52.229 --> 23:56.753
a common experience that everybody shares that goes through the end.

23:57.654 --> 24:06.163
Are there some, what are the parts, what are the events, the things that contribute most to that bonding?

24:07.304 --> 24:07.744
The people.

24:08.205 --> 24:11.088
The people, okay.

24:11.108 --> 24:12.569
Does it matter what your major was?

24:15.332 --> 24:17.494
Is the spirit there for all majors?

24:18.908 --> 24:25.255
I'm not sure it is today, I think it was at that point in time, but then I can't evaluate it very good.

24:26.897 --> 24:31.162
For your contemporaries, did it matter what town you came from?

24:31.182 --> 24:33.865
No, no.

24:35.267 --> 24:37.169
Didn't matter what your dad did for a living?

24:37.329 --> 24:37.549
No.

24:41.694 --> 24:48.662
And as you look back on your professional life since then, did A&M prepare you well for your career?

24:51.933 --> 25:17.046
There's never been another thing that I have done which opened as many doors as graduating from A&M and that is one of the significant things of the A&M ring is everybody in the engineering profession particularly recognized that ring as an evidence of

25:19.237 --> 25:26.408
having been through and accomplished that, was required to get that rank of degree.

25:27.149 --> 25:36.664
In general, in engineering, what do you think is the general evaluation of the strengths of A&M engineers?

25:37.746 --> 25:39.408
What's good about A&M engineers?

25:42.533 --> 25:46.459
When I got out of A&M and for some years

25:50.422 --> 26:01.640
After that, the practical education that an A&M engineering student got.

26:02.641 --> 26:11.535
When I got out of A&M, I went to work for the railroad for the

26:17.320 --> 26:18.923
I don't remember the railroad now.

26:18.943 --> 26:19.904
It's out of business.

26:20.225 --> 26:20.765
Burlington?

26:20.966 --> 26:21.847
No.

26:21.867 --> 26:22.348
Katy?

26:22.368 --> 26:22.428
No.

26:22.789 --> 26:24.732
Southern Pacific?

26:25.072 --> 26:25.373
No.

26:25.833 --> 26:26.574
Rock Island?

26:26.715 --> 26:30.461
No.

26:30.481 --> 26:31.382
Headquarters in St.

26:31.442 --> 26:33.205
Louis was at that point in time.

26:33.225 --> 26:33.906
Missouri Pacific?

26:33.926 --> 26:34.948
Missouri Pacific, yeah.

26:35.148 --> 26:38.693
I went to work in Missouri Pacific Railroad.

26:38.713 --> 26:44.222
And out of the group, there were about

26:46.328 --> 26:53.159
six other engineers, eight other engineers, two of us from A&M.

26:54.681 --> 27:11.948
They were engineers from Purdue, Notre Dame, Cornell, I don't remember, two or three other schools, no other Texas school, all went to work on a big construction job,

27:13.801 --> 27:24.478
mainline chain building, mainline track, moving a track out of the river bottom up in Missouri and Kansas.

27:28.264 --> 27:41.125
I think I could evaluate these, what was happening or the capabilities of these people better than other people who had just graduated because

27:41.341 --> 27:48.827
the age and experience that I had before I went to A&M.

27:48.847 --> 27:55.513
The A&M student, when you put him out on the job from the first day, he was productive.

27:58.376 --> 28:00.738
He related to people well.

28:00.758 --> 28:10.386
He knew what he was about and where there was an orientation period for most other

28:11.176 --> 28:16.083
students from other schools that they had to learn what was going on.

28:16.163 --> 28:23.433
Now their fundamentals of engineering was probably just as good and maybe in some cases maybe better than any of them.

28:24.074 --> 28:35.850
But their ability to relate to people, and I'm talking about people from the man doing the pick and shovel work down here to the man, the owner of the project.

28:41.247 --> 28:44.672
I'm not sure it is today.

28:45.974 --> 28:46.695
Let's hope it is.

28:46.715 --> 28:47.636
I agree with you.

28:47.656 --> 28:48.357
I hope it is.

28:51.662 --> 29:02.057
If you were a consultant to the A&M leadership today, what would you advise them regarding how they guide A&M in the future?

29:11.639 --> 29:14.283
I'd have to think about that one.

29:14.303 --> 29:19.591
I think there are two ways that, there's two avenues.

29:22.936 --> 29:38.760
A&M I think is, and I don't object to this, and I don't necessarily disagree with it, I think they are at this point in time pursuing an academic.

29:39.837 --> 29:45.984
a high academic achievement for their students, particularly their A&M students.

29:46.705 --> 29:50.089
I mean their engineering students.

29:50.109 --> 29:52.732
And I would assume all of them.

29:52.752 --> 30:01.823
Where 40 years ago, 50 years ago, the emphasis was on the practical end of things.

30:03.545 --> 30:09.372
Now, with a high academic learning,

30:10.347 --> 30:28.910
most people can transition into the practical work of it, where if you do not have those academics, but only the practical experience, you are probably more limited, is my view of it.

30:32.734 --> 30:39.763
Nevertheless, there is a niche for engineers who

30:40.115 --> 30:45.261
who have a very basic practical approach to things.

30:47.844 --> 30:51.689
I could talk to you a long time about my philosophy about engineers.

30:51.809 --> 30:53.651
I think they are a unique group.

30:57.135 --> 31:05.144
And one of the things that make them unique, I think, is their honesty.

31:05.164 --> 31:09.970
They deal with a profession which requires honesty.

31:11.452 --> 31:19.663
I cannot talk this table into carrying any more load than the material that it's made out of will support.

31:20.324 --> 31:27.114
And I can talk until I'm blue in the face, and it's just not going to change.

31:27.134 --> 31:34.564
And as an engineer, I must recognize that and deal with it from that viewpoint.

31:34.584 --> 31:39.130
Therefore, those of us that have fooled with it for as many years as I have,

31:40.325 --> 31:43.247
developed a way of thinking that
