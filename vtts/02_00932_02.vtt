00:04.942 --> 00:33.497
The interesting thing is, and I have to remind you 
of, while HUD missed the opportunity to become a

00:04.942 --> 00:33.497
central timing agency for whatever reason,

00:04.942 --> 00:33.497
the old Bureau of Public Roads and its successor, 
the U.S. Department of Transportation,

00:04.942 --> 00:33.497
particularly the Highway Administration, the 
Mass Transportation Administration, stepped

00:04.942 --> 00:33.497
in. very boldly, and had it not been for the old 
Bureau of Public Works and its insistence on what

00:33.899 --> 00:47.402
you and I call comprehensive planning as part of 
the Transition Study, planning would have

00:33.899 --> 00:47.402
vanished altogether. It didn't come from out. 
They didn't know what to do with it or what to do. It

00:51.609 --> 00:55.215
was really the engineers who said, you've got to 
have a plan It was people like Siegel saying, how

00:56.933 --> 01:08.304
can you go out there and confront the public if you 
don't have anything to show for that you thought

00:56.933 --> 01:08.304
about it and that this is a rational thing? You've 
got to do that. You can't just go spend money. And it

01:11.967 --> 01:24.199
was that simple, common sense, political 
instinct that saved planning, and then we had the

01:11.967 --> 01:24.199
planning requirements and the early 
transportation acts, and it happened to this day.

01:24.639 --> 01:26.721
And interestingly enough, Nixon

01:27.173 --> 01:37.603
didn't go out of his way to do positive things in 
urban areas. He nevertheless is really

01:38.084 --> 01:43.509
responsible for the regional councils. They had 
this feeble attempt of local coordination, and it

01:44.230 --> 01:48.034
wouldn't work. And it was under the Nixon 
administration that the presidential edict was

01:48.054 --> 01:53.299
declared from now on. Every project that is 
federally financed has to be okayed by some

01:53.667 --> 02:03.220
regional entity, council, governments, 
whatever, that represents elected officials.

02:04.121 --> 02:06.164
This is not good, but it is better than nothing. 
You're talking about A-95? Yeah, when it got

02:07.886 --> 02:10.450
started. It came out of the Nixon administration. 
Well, it actually started in Kennedy's.

02:16.838 --> 02:18.601
But it didn't have any... There was a secret memo, 
actually, that came... from Office of Management

02:22.321 --> 02:29.292
and Budget, but it never got outside of the Bureau. 
But it was searching for something like that. And

02:32.457 --> 02:35.121
then it eventually, it had to happen. There were 
too many federal programs that were going in

02:35.141 --> 02:38.006
different directions. And what was wrong with all 
of that stuff initially was that the people who

02:38.086 --> 02:47.721
served on these regional entities, planning 
entities, whatever they were, had no power to

02:48.190 --> 02:52.055
commit their own constituent governance. And 
Nixon changed that by a simple directive that, I

02:52.075 --> 03:07.715
forget the number of that, but he said that the 
governing boards of regional councils had to be

02:52.075 --> 03:07.715
composed of elected officials. And they had to be 
in proportion to the entities that they

03:08.536 --> 03:13.983
represented. And while this did not happen, legal 
force beyond that it nevertheless had a very

03:17.671 --> 03:44.657
practical political impact in that it brought the 
legislative bodies of the municipalities and

03:17.671 --> 03:44.657
governing bodies of counties in a given region 
into the accountability process well you voted

03:17.671 --> 03:44.657
for it and the man serving on the regional council 
wasn't just there as citizen shorts he was there as

03:45.228 --> 03:49.172
Councilman Schultz, who represented the Council 
of Central City. Victor Jones had a large part to

03:49.933 --> 04:00.365
play in recommending that to the feds from the 
Institute of Governmental Affairs in Berkeley.

04:00.385 --> 04:09.075
So I think there will be a strengthening of these 
kinds of agencies anyway, and I think with all this

04:00.385 --> 04:09.075
continued demand for people. Now, another 
interesting thing with the Tax Reform Act, The

04:13.747 --> 04:24.981
time period when real estate development was 
financed largely by people who had a need for tax

04:13.747 --> 04:24.981
shelter was over. Consequently, the individual 
investor is placed in a weak position vis-a-vis

04:25.482 --> 04:41.863
the institutional investor, particularly the 
pension funds and the insurance companies, who

04:25.482 --> 04:41.863
will now pretty much control the flow of capital 
into real estate development. And one of the

04:45.744 --> 04:58.402
consequences of this, I believe, and others have 
said the same thing, that will be a substantial

04:45.744 --> 04:58.402
professionalizing of real estate activities. 
There will be no more of this good old boy routine

04:58.522 --> 05:10.399
with young men operating in the seat of his pens, 
but a serious developer who will have a competent

04:58.522 --> 05:10.399
staff, that competent staff will deal 
effectively with the staff of the pension fund

05:10.666 --> 05:15.853
that is equally competent. And they will very 
critically examine propositions, approvals,

05:16.214 --> 05:28.391
participation, so that the quality of 
development should be higher in the next 30, 40

05:16.214 --> 05:28.391
years than it has been. And from our point of view, 
the point of view of academic institutions, a

05:28.631 --> 05:39.627
greater responsibility to produce more 
adequately trained individuals at the master's

05:39.758 --> 05:45.026
level and the doctoral level who can perform these 
functions. Yeah, it seems too that academia can

05:45.046 --> 06:07.622
pick up another void, and that would be to assist in 
monitoring the market and to make reliable data

05:45.046 --> 06:07.622
available to developers on the current status of 
the market. Yeah, centers such as ours and the Real

06:08.142 --> 06:13.308
Estate Research Center and others are doing that. 
And a third of our work in the Center for Urban

06:13.648 --> 06:18.014
Affairs is exactly that. We did recently this 
summer here in San Antonio, trying to identify and

06:19.395 --> 06:33.892
establish a reliable database for all available 
residential lots that are now on the market.

06:34.032 --> 06:37.997
Things of that sort are very important. I think you 
hit on something that's critical for our

06:38.348 --> 06:58.568
existence and for the development community and 
the real estate community, that we will finally

06:38.348 --> 06:58.568
agree that the database that we all use should be 
uniform and above board. an objective database

06:59.442 --> 07:08.573
and everybody uses it and so consequently 
decisions based on that should be much more

06:59.442 --> 07:08.573
objective. It's interesting in the greater 
Houston area now the Houston-Galveston Area

07:10.395 --> 07:26.395
Council is providing that function and all the 
municipalities including Houston have agreed

07:10.395 --> 07:26.395
that they will use the database and the forecasts 
that are generated by HGAC. so that they don't end

07:27.202 --> 07:30.966
up with two forecasts like the state of Texas has. 
So to sum up the question, I think the future has

07:32.828 --> 07:46.282
never been better for planning entities in the 
academic environment. We combine planning with

07:46.302 --> 07:51.788
research and practice, and you can't ask for more. 
How do you feel to go on to a somewhat different

07:56.328 --> 08:08.920
variation of this topic, how do you feel about the 
fact that we have three planning degree granting

07:56.328 --> 08:08.920
programs in Texas?

08:12.944 --> 08:25.255
Well, traditionally the University of Texas has 
followed different

08:12.944 --> 08:25.255
policies and educational philosophies.

08:30.349 --> 08:53.470
For whatever reason,

08:30.349 --> 08:53.470
Texas A&M has been recognized as the planning 
program that is primarily physical planning,

08:30.349 --> 08:53.470
also deals with social aspects, but it deals with 
it in the sense of

08:30.349 --> 08:53.470
developing potential management personnel that 
have the skills of dealing with all these issues

08:55.340 --> 09:02.927
immediately. University of Texas is a more, I 
think, broad general education type institution

09:03.707 --> 09:17.519
that is not overly concerned with applicability 
of skills. The person goes through that, maybe

09:17.539 --> 09:24.165
educated person in some way, but is not a skillful 
person. In our programs, you only want to produce a

09:24.719 --> 09:29.546
school for the persons who are also educated. 
That's the University of Texas in Austin. I was

09:33.813 --> 09:39.081
really quite surprised to learn that they offer no 
course in the history of planning in Texas. They

09:39.101 --> 09:46.592
don't even think of themselves, and that's a very 
interesting observation, because they really

09:39.101 --> 09:46.592
don't think of themselves as founding 
professionals as we do. For instance, as far as I

09:49.456 --> 09:57.344
know, there's only one member of the faculty who 
even holds membership in the American Institute

09:49.456 --> 09:57.344
of Certified Planners. And that's rather 
strange. University of Texas in Arlington has

10:00.748 --> 10:09.737
never been able to overcome its image as a 
community college, in a sense. They have all kinds

10:10.037 --> 10:14.842
of advanced degrees, but it is essentially dead. 
And also, they've been periodically

10:17.285 --> 10:30.843
troubled severely by total reorganization 
within the university structure, which

10:17.285 --> 10:30.843
essentially sets them back substantially every 
time it happens. So, I haven't paid a lot of

10:31.524 --> 10:45.283
attention to UTI, but I have no really education to 
deal with that, because it just seemed to be, in

10:31.524 --> 10:45.283
other words, a threat to us And UT Austin has never 
been a threat to us either. As a matter of fact, we

10:48.756 --> 10:58.589
rather enjoy a cordial, collegiate relationship 
with the University of Texas in Austin and send

10:48.756 --> 10:58.589
each other students. It's not unusual for someone 
to come here and say, Professor so-and-so at

10:58.629 --> 11:08.762
Austin suggested that I should perhaps talk to you 
because your program seems to be more to my liking.

11:09.182 --> 11:10.144
And we've done the same. It's just a different 
orientation. UT Arlington, I think, enjoys a

11:14.930 --> 11:21.980
superb location for a department of planning. 
They should be able to do better than Austin and

11:22.000 --> 11:26.567
Power Station. They should be on top of the world. 
But they don't. And interestingly enough,

11:31.494 --> 11:38.364
University of Houston had never even attempted to 
deal with planning. It's hostile to it. Rice has a

11:41.440 --> 11:47.849
few courses that they call planning, and they're 
pretty good, but no degree. Texas Southern has

11:50.012 --> 11:54.018
dabbled in it, but that's been almost a scandal.

12:03.011 --> 12:06.876
Wolf, I want to thank you very much for your time and 
for this interview. You're welcome.
