WEBVTT

00:01.938 --> 00:03.801
about the moose.

00:04.221 --> 00:11.211
I don't really remember the term moose buckets, but I know that the phrase was getting moosed.

00:11.792 --> 00:21.926
And it's interesting, all the way to San Antonio, the weekend I met my wife, I threatened that he had set me up with a date Friday night and Saturday during the day and Saturday night.

00:22.587 --> 00:28.755
And I kept telling him all the way down there if he moosed me, I'd stick Friday night out, but he had both of them Saturday.

00:29.136 --> 00:30.898
I was not going to stay down there, but I

00:31.132 --> 00:34.015
Just the whole way down, I said, Bill, if you moosed me.

00:34.877 --> 00:44.468
And one of the cruelest things I think I can recall regarding that was we were sitting in Sabisa Hall one Saturday.

00:45.009 --> 00:56.042
I had a friend of my father's with me who was from Waco and had known my mom and dad for years, and he'd just come down and we went to eat.

00:56.596 --> 01:01.963
And we're sitting there eating and all of a sudden this guy stood up the mess off.

01:01.983 --> 01:12.076
And you know you used to stand up during the week and you'd say, beat the hell out of SCU and everybody would stand up and wildcat and things like that.

01:13.198 --> 01:25.033
Some of them not as nice as others, but this guy stands up and in the middle of the dining that's going on says,

01:25.705 --> 01:30.133
Mr. Jones got moosed, and there's this guy sitting with his date.

01:30.713 --> 01:42.974
And I don't know if she knew what it meant, but I mean, I was terribly embarrassed about it, and he did get moosed.

01:43.034 --> 01:44.898
Was there a crowd reaction, too?

01:44.918 --> 01:45.919
Oh, yeah, kind of chuckle.

01:45.939 --> 01:51.088
I mean, it wasn't any big wildcatting, but there was this embarrassed laughter, I think, is how I would describe that.

01:51.389 --> 01:58.461
But this interesting, years later, this friend of my dad's, remember, you know, he's talking about, I never will forget that guy standing up saying so-and-so got moosed, you know.

01:58.982 --> 02:01.206
Whoever the guy was, I don't remember his name, obviously.

02:02.087 --> 02:07.897
But the beast, I don't really remember that, but it was big time, you know, so-and-so got moosed.

02:07.917 --> 02:10.942
The other thing was flush letters, you know.

02:11.683 --> 02:13.887
When I was a freshman,

02:14.508 --> 02:42.372
A flush letter would be, you know, your girlfriend wrote you and flushed you down the toilet basically, you know, and I mean they'd have little flush parties where they'd go into the bathroom and they'd flush the letter down the commode and they would almost ceremoniously, you know, probably cuss this girl out, certainly say things about her, you know, she's not worth it, she's no good, you're better off, and it was

02:42.605 --> 02:44.368
to quote get rid of her.

02:45.069 --> 03:01.212
I think it was a junior that was flushed and they end up calling me into his room and he's not very good with words and he can't write very well and he wants to write this girl a letter and beg her forgiveness and all.

03:01.232 --> 03:04.697
And so I get, I get commissioned to write this letter

03:04.913 --> 03:05.994
And you're a freshman?

03:06.014 --> 03:07.055
A freshman, yeah.

03:07.135 --> 03:14.022
So it goes back, I mean, I'm not sure what to do, but I sit down and start writing, and I mean, Mary, I tell you, I got the gift for the gab sometime.

03:14.082 --> 03:27.256
I start writing this letter about my dearest darling, and my heart is pained, you know, so greatly from the letter I received, and, you know, I love you so deeply, and I don't know, I wrote all this flowery stuff.

03:27.276 --> 03:31.360
And I can remember these juniors reading that letter, and saying,

03:31.728 --> 03:33.890
Damn, Fish Hickman, this is some good stuff.

03:34.111 --> 03:35.312
Damn, Fish Hickman, wow.

03:36.533 --> 03:37.955
Where did you get all this stuff, you know?

03:38.396 --> 03:40.118
And I mean, it impressed those guys.

03:40.198 --> 03:43.501
It kind of probably set me in good with some of them.

03:43.521 --> 03:46.925
And so I see the guy sometime later, and I said, did you ever send a letter?

03:46.965 --> 03:51.130
And he said, nah, nah, you know, I went on to another girl by now.

03:51.150 --> 03:53.973
So it was almost like it was a, they put me through an exercise.

03:54.033 --> 03:59.760
But I mean, I think he was in pain at the time, but he got over it real quickly, a lot sooner than he led me to believe.

04:00.027 --> 04:05.232
But, you know, that was a big deal if you went to the post office and got a flush letter.

04:05.292 --> 04:16.943
And, you know, a lot of times guys had high school girlfriends and then they would go to college and she may still be in high school or she'd go to a different college and obviously girls weren't going to school here when I first came here.

04:17.343 --> 04:18.925
That happened before I left.

04:19.525 --> 04:25.811
But, so, I mean, you know, the girls would meet somebody else and next thing you know these guys would get these flush letters.

04:25.831 --> 04:28.093
So, it was not uncommon for these guys to be getting

04:28.394 --> 04:32.299
blush letters, particularly our first year in school here.

04:32.499 --> 04:36.584
And, you know, I think back on that, that's kind of interesting.

04:37.465 --> 04:38.166
The MSC.

04:38.567 --> 04:38.887
Yeah.

04:38.907 --> 04:41.690
What role did that play in the student's life?

04:41.791 --> 04:55.127
Well, MSC was, you know, I think back in those days there was certainly, probably in general, more reverence for the

04:55.327 --> 05:20.400
sacrifices people made, so the MSC always had this special place and everybody started, you know, to some degree I think it still does, but MSC was a place you took, you know, parents, your girlfriends, you, it was a place on Sundays you'd go up there sometime and study and read.

05:20.460 --> 05:23.865
It was kind of a safe haven, I'd say, as well as

05:24.858 --> 05:27.120
as anything else.

05:27.220 --> 05:31.565
I don't remember eating there a lot.

05:31.745 --> 05:34.948
What about the programs at the MSC's activities?

05:34.968 --> 05:40.253
Yeah, they had a lot of activities and unfortunately I didn't get involved in a lot of them.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.115
I was involved in a hometown club.

05:43.917 --> 05:53.346
Most of it was and I was involved in a

05:53.748 --> 06:00.861
interdenominational religious club, and some... Talk about religion.

06:01.542 --> 06:04.948
Well, there again, I was a little unique.

06:04.968 --> 06:10.498
My grandmother was a very religious person.

06:10.578 --> 06:17.410
My grandmother taught me a lot about what I know about religion, really, because

06:17.744 --> 06:26.460
You know, I can remember she had, right there at Northgate, she had a, she kept her little stewardship envelopes where she managed an apartment house.

06:26.480 --> 06:34.435
And in her bathroom there was a board that she had keys to the apartments up there that she kept.

06:34.455 --> 06:38.082
And keys to, and she rented out some garages there as well.

06:38.720 --> 06:44.146
And she kept her stewardship envelopes up there, and every Sunday she'd pull in.

06:44.326 --> 06:50.373
She probably taught me more about stewardship than anybody just watching her as a little boy on Sundays grabbing that envelope.

06:50.994 --> 06:59.663
We went to the A&M Presbyterian Church, which was just really a block named, two blocks behind, where she lived on Church Street there.

06:59.703 --> 07:02.206
It was short blocks, too, really.

07:02.226 --> 07:03.968
And so we'd walk to church.

07:04.268 --> 07:12.760
I walked from my dorm at Northgate there over to her place and then walked to church with her a lot of times on Sundays.

07:12.780 --> 07:26.198
And I got involved a little bit with some of the student organizations, but never really got strongly plugged into that.

07:27.059 --> 07:33.448
As a freshman it's kind of hard to do some of that because you could get passes to do things like that.

07:34.019 --> 07:37.543
But I don't remember doing that.

07:37.703 --> 07:39.766
I was pretty regular going to church on Sunday.

07:40.046 --> 07:43.691
Do you think a lot of students went to the Northgate churches?

07:43.731 --> 07:44.311
No.

07:44.592 --> 07:46.274
Well, I mean, it was a mixture.

07:46.374 --> 07:47.295
I mean, there were some.

07:47.335 --> 07:49.417
My roommate Chris went regularly.

07:49.458 --> 07:51.740
He was a Catholic, and he went regularly to church.

07:51.961 --> 07:57.908
And I guess there were, you know, it's hard for me to say.

07:58.008 --> 07:58.769
I just don't remember.

07:58.849 --> 07:59.990
I remember going to church.

08:00.050 --> 08:01.512
I remember my roommate going to church.

08:01.964 --> 08:09.333
I remember other people going to church on Sunday morning, but a lot of times, you know, the weekends, people would get out of here.

08:09.353 --> 08:11.596
You know, you stop and think, we didn't have girls here then.

08:12.057 --> 08:15.501
7,500 is all core for the most part.

08:16.682 --> 08:21.288
I mean, core, you know, 4,500, 5,000 out of the 7,500 anyway.

08:22.009 --> 08:26.655
And so when you, you know, finish drill Saturday at noon, I mean, people dispersed.

08:27.192 --> 08:30.495
So that's probably why I don't remember as much of the church-wide activities.

08:30.555 --> 08:38.762
I know there were some people in my outfit that we did some church functions together, and they were upperclassmen.

08:38.782 --> 08:46.950
And when you'd get to those functions, they would very quickly drop handles with you and then remind you that you were fish-hickling when you got back to the dorm.

08:47.791 --> 08:49.352
But they always treated you different after that.

08:50.413 --> 08:57.199
Do you remember any students who were not either Christian or apparently Christian

08:57.517 --> 08:59.540
Remember any Jewish students, any Muslim?

09:00.381 --> 09:06.048
Yeah, I can remember some, but I don't have any memories of them other than if there were some here.

09:06.388 --> 09:12.716
Do you remember any incidents that in hindsight would have been in them?

09:12.736 --> 09:17.261
No, I don't remember any prejudicial treatment of those people at all.

09:18.463 --> 09:25.752
The main thing, you know, we would always call the students from

09:27.065 --> 09:29.668
like Indian, Pakistan, camel jocks.

09:29.688 --> 09:32.351
I mean, that was a pretty regular term.

09:33.773 --> 09:38.559
Mary and I, when we lived in Mary apartments, we had some from India live below us.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.602
And nice people, we got to know them.

09:41.703 --> 09:46.468
The only thing I could sense is that woman cooked with curry strongly.

09:46.709 --> 09:50.253
And I mean, I cannot eat curry now, because every night I smell that.

09:50.273 --> 09:55.179
We lived upstairs, you know, and we lived over in College View, and that would come up in the area.

09:55.519 --> 09:57.021
But I don't personally,

09:57.575 --> 10:03.622
remember any instance that embarrassed me now related to religion.

10:03.702 --> 10:04.984
We had Hispanics here.

10:05.024 --> 10:06.906
We did not have any black students.

10:06.986 --> 10:10.651
I don't recall at that time if we did.

10:11.512 --> 10:12.473
But I don't think we did.

10:12.753 --> 10:16.878
And I don't recall any prejudicial treatment of the Hispanic people that were here.

10:16.899 --> 10:20.022
There were several in my outfit, so one lived next door to me.

10:20.423 --> 10:26.350
And they may have had, if you were to talk to them, they may have some stories of some situations.

10:26.617 --> 10:28.699
I didn't personally observe anything like that.

10:28.719 --> 10:42.915
Why do you think A&M student body was a competitively inclusive group for these other, for this diversity?

10:43.495 --> 10:47.780
Well, I've always, you know, and I guess A&M taught me, I shouldn't say I've always felt this way.

10:47.800 --> 10:55.408
I've felt since I've come to A&M and I've seen situations that have caused that to happen since.

10:56.266 --> 10:59.971
difficult times will bind people together.

10:59.991 --> 11:03.496
And that can also fragment people.

11:04.218 --> 11:10.126
But I think there was a common thread that we were Aggies.

11:11.067 --> 11:14.853
Particularly if you're going through the core and you're going through push-ups and all of that.

11:15.454 --> 11:18.859
I mean it didn't matter whether you were black, white, green, yellow, blue, whatever.

11:18.899 --> 11:23.185
You know, you were going through this and you were an Aggie and this guy's going through what you're going through.

11:23.907 --> 11:40.505
And I think that there's something to be said about that's why we come out of this school with a tremendous, you know, I've talked to other Aggies that went to school in the time frame I did or earlier, and I'm not unique that I hated this place early on.

11:40.725 --> 11:47.512
And, you know, as you talk to others, if they'll be honest with you, there'll be others that will tell you that.

11:47.532 --> 11:50.235
And I mean, I can remember clearly, I hate this damn place.

11:50.620 --> 11:59.792
I mean, I can remember sitting in my room and having upperclassmen walk up and down the hallway screaming that out as I'm studying.

12:00.713 --> 12:05.299
But that changed, you said, even during your second semester.

12:05.319 --> 12:06.060
Yeah, it did for me.

12:06.401 --> 12:08.183
Now, I would say I was unique there.

12:09.144 --> 12:13.029
I was fortunate that it happened for me then.

12:13.650 --> 12:16.594
I think others had happened sophomore and junior year.

12:17.080 --> 12:21.404
But I love to, my second semester, my freshman year, I enjoy.

12:21.904 --> 12:26.969
It's too bad freshmen don't really understand that there is a way to enjoy that first year experience.

12:27.049 --> 12:39.420
But my point is that something happens here that causes people, I mean, a lot of schools that kids come in and say, I really like it here, and they leave, I really like it here, and they're not supporting their university.

12:39.440 --> 12:46.446
They say, here, there's a transformation from I hate it to, you know, gosh almighty, we're burying them in maroon caskets, and

12:46.831 --> 12:53.984
You know, I go to a football game, they're saying the spirit, I still get a little misty-eyed and things like that.

12:54.445 --> 13:04.283
And I mean, I have this intense love for this university, which fortunately my wife lived here for two years and understands, because otherwise I think that would be a problem.

13:04.668 --> 13:10.514
I think, you know, at least from the inclusiveness, I think it's from going through difficult times.

13:10.914 --> 13:21.825
My son-in-law, James Barrett, class 85, and my daughter Carol's class 85, his father is a survivor of junction with Barry Bryant.

13:22.566 --> 13:31.975
Now you want to talk about a group that's still united and bonds together, you know, Marvin Tate, Dennis Goering, Gene Stallings, Jack Pardee,

13:32.393 --> 13:39.563
And when my daughter's father-in-law comes, he used to come see us in Houston and spend the weekend with us.

13:39.583 --> 13:42.647
He'd get on the phone and call Pardee and next thing you know he's down at his home.

13:43.048 --> 13:45.672
Pardee's coaching the Oilers, got football games going on.

13:45.692 --> 13:49.517
He still always had time for Ray Barrett out of West Texas.

13:50.158 --> 13:54.745
But I think those guys went through something that will bind them together for life.

13:55.706 --> 14:02.215
And so long-winded answer to your question, I think the inclusiveness comes from going through an experience together.

14:02.684 --> 14:12.347
And I've seen it other times where if you go through some rough times together, you come out of it better off as individuals and with a better relationship if you survive it.

14:12.528 --> 14:20.507
What is the real meaning of the term Highway 6 runs both ways?

14:21.668 --> 14:27.420
It doesn't get caught up in the Aggie spirit or doesn't like the way we do things.

14:27.921 --> 14:34.615
It's inbound and it's outbound is one way to look at it, the other way is it runs both north and south.

14:35.118 --> 14:38.442
But meaning that anytime you don't like it here, hit the rope, Jack.

14:38.502 --> 14:39.864
I mean, that's what it means to me.

14:41.105 --> 14:50.577
Which, it's interesting, you know, you'll still find people say that, even from our classes, if you were to say something that, hey, you know, it's Highway 6 runs both ways.

14:50.657 --> 14:53.580
That wouldn't happen as often.

14:53.600 --> 14:54.461
We say that a lot.

14:54.481 --> 14:56.283
You know, some guys say, ah, this is stupid.

14:56.324 --> 14:57.245
I think that's stupid.

14:57.265 --> 14:58.486
I don't want to do this.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.509
Hey, Jack, Highway 6 runs both ways.

15:00.989 --> 15:02.871
Don't let the door hitch in the rear on the way out.

15:03.973 --> 15:05.074
And...

15:05.645 --> 15:10.997
That's probably a little bit elitist bit, you know, we get into this and we like it and we don't want it to change.

15:11.017 --> 15:13.462
And if you want to change it, we don't necessarily want you around here.

15:14.063 --> 15:25.729
I don't know that it was so much that we don't want you here, but if you're not happy here, get the highway.

15:26.890 --> 15:27.931
kind of discarded.

15:28.011 --> 15:31.994
Yeah, I have no memories of that, of any significance at all.

15:32.335 --> 15:35.958
G. Raleigh White was where we played all the games, which opened up in the 50s as I recall.

15:36.078 --> 15:37.679
It was a new facility, you see, to us.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.921
And that's where we graduated too.

15:39.941 --> 15:45.066
Make believe that I had never seen G. Raleigh describe it for me, on the inside.

15:46.427 --> 15:47.828
Physically and emotionally.

15:50.690 --> 15:55.935
Well, emotionally, it was, I mean,

15:56.776 --> 15:59.219
I guess that's hard for me to do, Haskell.

15:59.339 --> 16:16.140
I'm not gifted like you are with describing feelings and all so much, but it was a basketball arena or a coliseum that always, it's a horseshoe like the football field is.

16:16.161 --> 16:18.423
You know, it had that one end that was just a wall.

16:19.365 --> 16:24.471
I never did understand that, not that I ever really tried to understand it, but

16:24.772 --> 16:34.929
You know physically it's rather steep and if you get up in the top it does seem rather high up there.

16:37.033 --> 16:40.459
You know emotionally there's some special things that have happened there.

16:40.479 --> 16:44.265
I've seen some great basketball games.

16:44.752 --> 16:56.209
You know, I remember one year we were playing Texas and we had a one point lead on and they had a guy foul and he went to the free throw line and missed the free throws and got the rebound and we fouled him again.

16:56.329 --> 17:02.118
But the same guy on the line, he missed free throws again and we ended up winning that game like by one point.

17:02.298 --> 17:07.987
And this guy missed these free throws in the last six seconds of the game and it's right at the end of the game.

17:08.107 --> 17:13.695
It seemed like they were both one and ones, he may have just missed two.

17:14.333 --> 17:17.236
I mean, gee, that place was wild, yelling and screaming.

17:18.277 --> 17:21.621
The guy had been lucky, he was lucky he got it up there at all.

17:21.641 --> 17:26.507
I mean, there was so much emotion in that room at the time.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.188
What other activities?

17:28.228 --> 17:29.750
Well, we had Town Hall in there.

17:29.810 --> 17:35.356
Do you remember any other, other than the music, some famous people you remember?

17:35.376 --> 17:39.601
Yes, I heard Lyndon Johnson when he was Vice President of the United States here.

17:40.082 --> 17:43.125
He came and spoke on campus.

17:43.561 --> 17:59.978
I remember him, when he finished he saw somebody he knew, so he jumped down and off the rather high platform there, which I thought was kind of spry for him.

17:59.998 --> 18:13.332
Another thing I remember is Olin Teague had some sons, and my wife could tell you the ones, the son that did this, because I can't remember his name right now, but Mary was pregnant with our daughter.

18:14.240 --> 18:19.405
And the only seats that were left were way up at the top of the G Raleigh, and we were about to walk up there.

18:19.785 --> 18:23.208
And he was sitting like on the first row, and he saw Mary, and he gave us that.

18:23.329 --> 18:28.353
Where he was sitting, there was enough room for, I think, if both of us sat down.

18:28.453 --> 18:31.536
I know he gave her his seat, so she went and crawled up there.

18:31.556 --> 18:32.677
This was for the LBJ speech?

18:32.738 --> 18:34.920
Yeah, this one went to LBJ speech.

18:35.060 --> 18:36.601
That was Scoma.

18:36.621 --> 18:37.042
It was.

18:37.082 --> 18:37.942
See, I didn't remember that.

18:37.982 --> 18:38.883
I just remember he came.

18:39.044 --> 18:43.808
Were you part of the group that welcomed Linda Byrd to

18:44.733 --> 18:46.876
lunch at Duncan.

18:46.976 --> 18:47.858
I don't even know that story.

18:47.938 --> 18:54.728
At a given point, this was where, Scona was then in December, right after we had lost the football game very, very early.

18:54.748 --> 18:57.172
Oh, yeah, gosh, December of 63.

18:57.372 --> 18:57.933
There you go.

18:58.313 --> 18:59.816
And, no, no, no, no.

19:00.056 --> 19:00.777
November of 63.

19:01.278 --> 19:02.500
I thought he came in 62.

19:03.701 --> 19:04.783
And we had lost about one.

19:05.118 --> 19:08.522
Oh, we lost over in Austin like 21 to 14 or something like that.

19:08.542 --> 19:13.208
And so in a given signal, every fish jumps up and yells, beat the hell out of T.U.

19:13.288 --> 19:14.049
Oh, is that right?

19:14.289 --> 19:21.438
Then Linda Bird stands up sternly, and the room is very silent.

19:22.279 --> 19:27.986
She puts her napkins down, then pushes a chair under the table, looks around.

19:28.006 --> 19:31.530
It is irkily quiet.

19:32.624 --> 19:35.047
and then all at once yells, hook them horns.

19:35.167 --> 19:37.350
And they applaud her.

19:39.794 --> 19:45.181
In 1980, in the fall of 1980, I had a chance to tell that story to Lady Bird.

19:45.621 --> 19:48.105
And Mrs. Johnson quickly said, that's my girl.

19:48.445 --> 19:50.187
That's my girl.

19:50.988 --> 19:52.911
Describe commencement in the

19:53.144 --> 19:56.888
Well, not a lot different than it was now.

19:56.928 --> 19:57.509
We sat on the floor.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.993
No, but make believe that you're explaining it to someone that's never seen or heard of it.

20:01.013 --> 20:10.503
Well, at commencement, the graduates sit on the floor, and basketball floor, and parents all sit up in the stands.

20:10.844 --> 20:12.466
It's packed.

20:12.846 --> 20:15.029
Graduation special at A&M always has been.

20:15.089 --> 20:21.536
Every graduate walks the stage, gets his diploma from the president, actually is not rushed even.

20:21.556 --> 20:22.577
I mean, there's a

20:23.300 --> 20:27.686
That's one of the special things about graduation in last year's President's Association.

20:27.706 --> 20:32.332
The thing I will miss most this year is sitting on stage for graduation.

20:33.474 --> 20:33.994
I loved that.

20:34.815 --> 20:35.336
I loved it.

20:36.417 --> 20:43.086
Watching the faces of those kids, and where I sat up there, I could see their faces just before they got their diploma.

20:43.106 --> 20:52.699
And then I could see their faces right after they got, and another, and I'll skip around a little bit, but I could, one thing that was interesting was watch them when they come marching in.

20:53.388 --> 20:54.570
They all find their parents.

20:55.130 --> 20:59.236
Now, Aunt Mary had a reserve seat and I knew where she was and I'm still kind of looking for her up there.

20:59.876 --> 21:05.784
But those kids, there's 8,000 people sitting up there and they find their parents, all of them.

21:06.064 --> 21:12.893
And it was thrilling for me to see how many of them acknowledge their relatives when they get their diploma.

21:12.913 --> 21:19.902
And you know, in other words, this isn't just me walking the stage, this is all of us getting this diploma.

21:20.371 --> 21:29.542
the smiles on their faces and the shaking of the diploma at their parents and the parents cheering and ringing cowbells and all the things that they can do up there.

21:30.323 --> 21:32.886
And I hope we never lose that moment.

21:32.986 --> 21:34.568
Are the names called out?

21:34.588 --> 21:36.130
Yes, every name is called out.

21:36.190 --> 21:37.331
Are they pronounced correctly?

21:37.451 --> 21:39.093
Well, you know that's interesting.

21:39.153 --> 21:44.119
Roger Fellman's been doing that for years and I can't recall the other gentleman's name that does that.

21:44.179 --> 21:45.360
Don't put that in the book.

21:45.380 --> 21:47.543
I couldn't remember his name because I met him this year.

21:48.012 --> 21:52.538
But I talked to Roger on stage this year and I said, Roger, how do you do that?

21:52.899 --> 21:55.042
He said, I can go down the list.

21:55.062 --> 21:58.286
And he said, when I see a name I'm unsure of, I call the guy on the phone.

21:58.406 --> 22:00.990
And I say, how do I pronounce your name?

22:01.010 --> 22:02.031
Can you imagine?

22:02.051 --> 22:06.137
I mean, we graduate, what, 9,000 students here a year.

22:06.157 --> 22:07.599
Is that about right?

22:07.619 --> 22:09.061
Yeah, that's what Ray told me.

22:09.401 --> 22:15.910
There's 10 graduations count in that school and the medical college graduations here.

22:16.548 --> 22:20.854
And in that period of time, I mean, this guy calls every name he's not sure of.

22:21.014 --> 22:25.921
And these, the Oriental names, and he whips those names out.

22:26.082 --> 22:29.607
And I'm amazed at the time they take to do that right.

22:29.867 --> 22:30.648
But they do it right.

22:31.309 --> 22:35.895
And the graduation is a wonderful experience.

22:35.916 --> 22:37.318
It is a wonderful time.

22:37.498 --> 22:38.760
You know, it's interesting.

22:38.820 --> 22:40.522
I remember my graduation speaker.

22:40.582 --> 22:44.007
It was Governor Conley, John Conley.

22:45.050 --> 22:56.863
I graduated in 64, he was shot in 63, and I asked him to sign my program outside G. Raleigh after the graduation was over.

22:57.584 --> 23:10.298
And I didn't realize this until later, but he said, well I'd be happy to, and he starts signing and he looked over his right shoulder up at the top of G. Raleigh White, and then he signed a little bit more and he looked over his shoulder, and in signing

23:10.531 --> 23:13.033
Best wishes, you know, John Conley kind of thing.

23:13.334 --> 23:15.396
He must have looked over his shoulder three or four times.

23:15.876 --> 23:18.259
And then later on I realized he was shot upper right.

23:18.839 --> 23:20.401
And this was just months later.

23:21.041 --> 23:26.086
And so he was very, still had a tremendous impact on his life, as you can imagine.

23:27.027 --> 23:30.291
But anyway, graduations are wonderful.

23:30.931 --> 23:35.956
As you have seen graduations over many years, have they changed much?

23:36.437 --> 23:39.880
I don't think they've changed a lot, personally, which is something I'm proud of.

23:40.467 --> 23:44.453
And I hope they never do.

23:44.994 --> 23:52.785
I mean, I hear these places where they ask everybody to stand up and they confer the degree and then they all sit down and ours take three hours.

23:53.306 --> 23:59.295
And people told me, you know, don't worry about sitting up on that stage three hours because they have a break where you can go off to.

23:59.936 --> 24:03.982
You know, Haskell, I only left that stage in eight graduations a couple of times.

24:04.162 --> 24:06.846
One was to go grab a guy

24:07.096 --> 24:10.579
that his sister had asked me to say hello to him.

24:10.599 --> 24:12.041
I missed him crossing the stage.

24:12.201 --> 24:15.084
I saw where he sat down, and I thought he was leaving.

24:15.104 --> 24:18.267
I saw him get up and leave, and I ran out and caught him out in front of G. Raleigh White.

24:18.767 --> 24:22.231
And the other time I went, because my throat got dry, I went to get something to drink, came right back up.

24:22.931 --> 24:25.694
That was the shortest three hours I ever spent, watching those kids graduate.

24:26.075 --> 24:31.560
I didn't get carried away, but graduation is, to me, I would say the experience those kids are having now.

24:31.880 --> 24:36.765
The only thing that's changed is when I graduated, most of the people walking on stage were in uniform.

24:37.218 --> 24:41.242
and now most of the kids that are walking that stage are in caps and gowns.

24:41.262 --> 24:47.087
The Corps still graduates in the uniform, and there are women walking that stage.

24:47.207 --> 24:49.009
Let's go back to that point.

24:49.149 --> 24:51.451
Were you a student when the first women?

24:51.511 --> 24:52.152
Yes, I was.

24:53.233 --> 24:56.676
Tell me what you think was the general reaction.

24:56.756 --> 24:59.519
Well, we didn't want women on campus.

24:59.539 --> 25:00.660
It was kind of interesting.

25:00.720 --> 25:04.103
I can remember having a debate with a freshman when I was a junior.

25:04.572 --> 25:06.094
I mean, it was a friendly little debate.

25:06.114 --> 25:08.738
It wasn't anything upper classmen, lower classmen deal.

25:08.758 --> 25:13.745
But, you know, he was saying if it's state-supported, women are the, you know, that's fair.

25:13.805 --> 25:25.882
And I said, well, if you had ten state-supported schools, you had eight of them co-educational, for those who want to go co-ed, one of them all male and one of them all female, isn't that a fairer distribution of the tax dollars and forcing them all to have women?

25:26.583 --> 25:33.212
My wife, and most of the women that were dating Aggies or that were married Aggies were very opposed to women coming here.

25:33.361 --> 25:38.119
And not because girls would threaten their husband, that wasn't the issue.

25:38.541 --> 25:44.704
The issue that Mary didn't want to ever see leave was how special women were treated on this campus.

25:45.140 --> 25:59.275
And I've had girls when I was being dated said you know I went to Texas or I went to this other school and guys are hanging out the windows yelling at me and obscene things and hey honey come up to my room I'll give you a good time.

25:59.755 --> 26:01.758
And they said that never happens on this campus.

26:01.798 --> 26:05.081
The women were treated with respect and they were treated special.

26:05.882 --> 26:13.510
And my experience was other than the incident with the Moose situation, women were always treated very special here.

26:13.962 --> 26:19.651
If you had a date, you had sophomore privileges, you know, and things like that.

26:20.072 --> 26:26.603
But that's the thing Mary didn't want to see leave, is how, and I don't know, I still think women are treated good here.

26:26.623 --> 26:28.706
I think we've done a good job of holding on to that too.

26:29.207 --> 26:33.934
Now, in high, you know, we didn't want the name changed, and we didn't want women.

26:33.995 --> 26:40.425
They tried to, they were trying to change our name to Texas Tech, I mean Texas State, and

26:40.996 --> 26:46.023
I remember again somebody standing up in the mess hall saying, beat the hell out of Texas State University.

26:46.423 --> 26:49.227
Everybody cheered, you know, because they were happy for that.

26:51.510 --> 26:51.771
Thank you.

26:51.791 --> 26:53.473
Actually, we're talking about the coming of women.

26:53.513 --> 26:57.699
Do you remember any classes that you had with women in them?

26:58.660 --> 27:05.890
No, because most of the, I mean, it was possible, but most of the women that were here were in the freshman classes.

27:06.325 --> 27:13.277
How do you think they were, those first women students were treated in the hallway?

27:13.538 --> 27:13.959
Coldly.

27:15.341 --> 27:19.068
I mean, I don't have any personal experiences of that.

27:20.671 --> 27:25.279
I know I personally, it's kind of like all of that that went on there.

27:25.399 --> 27:30.949
In hindsight, those are the best, that changed this university forever for the better.

27:31.300 --> 27:40.954
I can't tell you the pride of walking my daughter on this campus to go to school here, which would never have happened if that hadn't happened, admitted women obviously.

27:41.835 --> 27:48.304
And you know, the 21 year old guy, whatever I was back then, I wasn't smart enough to see all of that stuff.

27:48.985 --> 27:51.489
The name change was good, we needed to get away from that.

27:51.709 --> 27:53.612
All of those things were good.

27:54.301 --> 28:15.837
but uh I think a lot of us at the time uh that you know there's some probably some bitterness the students probably feel like they have enough to say about it and uh but but for the most part I think uh I think women were in class were probably ignored uh or

28:16.070 --> 28:20.877
I don't remember having a single woman in any of my classes, and I may have and not remember.

28:20.897 --> 28:26.706
Do you remember any reaction at all to the admission of black students?

28:26.726 --> 28:27.026
Uh, no.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.952
No, I don't.

28:30.972 --> 28:33.136
As far as you know, that went with no problem.

28:33.156 --> 28:37.442
Well, you know, I mean, I just, yeah, I mean, I don't know of any problem there.

28:37.923 --> 28:39.706
You know, it's kind of interesting.

28:40.306 --> 28:45.334
I think A&M's always been a place that if you come here expecting something special because you're different,

28:45.753 --> 28:46.955
you're probably going to have trouble.

28:47.315 --> 28:52.102
If you come here saying, hey, look, I just want to be an Aggie, I don't think it matters.

28:52.122 --> 28:58.911
I mean, I've seen some, you know, I've looked at black students rising to be the president of the student body.

28:59.972 --> 29:04.038
I've seen overweight kids in the Corps.

29:06.101 --> 29:14.612
But, you know, I remember a pretty good-sized woman in the band one time that, you know, she came in here and she just was one of the guys, you know, I mean,

29:14.930 --> 29:16.872
I shouldn't say one of the guys, one of the Aggies, you know.

29:16.952 --> 29:27.183
Anybody that comes here and wants to work hard and do their best and try to succeed, I think the door's open.

29:27.203 --> 29:28.284
I really do believe that.

29:28.804 --> 29:38.074
I'm not saying we don't have some that are, may not, I mean, you may, 40-something thousand students, you may have a situation where somebody treats somebody poorly.

29:39.355 --> 29:43.840
But I think that's what Aggie, an Aggie,

29:45.406 --> 30:00.786
translates into a lot of different things, and when you call yourself an Aggie, you're able to, I mean, women, blacks, Hispanics, whites, you know, it doesn't matter.

30:01.226 --> 30:07.454
You can all, you're all called an Aggie, and I think that's a unifying deal, and that's good.

30:07.935 --> 30:09.777
What was your perception for old Rudder?

30:10.060 --> 30:14.766
He was tough.

30:15.146 --> 30:18.631
He ran things the way he wanted to.

30:18.651 --> 30:22.475
There was respect for him, because he was a war hero.

30:23.036 --> 30:24.418
Did y'all have any nicknames for him?

30:25.920 --> 30:28.283
Yeah, gosh, I don't know if I remember.

30:29.965 --> 30:31.707
What did we call him?

30:31.907 --> 30:33.729
General, we call him General a lot.

30:36.393 --> 30:39.156
Describe him physically.

30:39.558 --> 30:40.419
stocky guy.

30:40.439 --> 30:43.863
I don't remember his height, but I don't think he was terribly tall.

30:46.426 --> 30:53.013
But distinguished looking, I always thought, you know, he was a distinguished looking gentleman.

30:55.996 --> 30:59.861
You know, had the greatest impact on this university that any one person will ever have.

31:00.721 --> 31:04.806
I believe, I mean, you can go back and make some arguments for people in the early days and

31:05.208 --> 31:10.195
And Cushing, when he basically saved the university from being part of the University of Texas.

31:10.396 --> 31:12.018
I mean, there's some tremendous things.

31:12.038 --> 31:15.203
But you think about all Rudder did when he was here, it's hard to argue.

31:15.223 --> 31:19.970
I mean, there may have been some people who have done this much, but not more than him.

31:19.990 --> 31:22.153
He lived just over there near us.
