00:03.018 --> 00:09.707
Most important question of all, what feelings do 
you hold in your heart for A&M today?

00:12.852 --> 00:21.224
I was expecting that one, of course, eventually 
because of the discussion Saturday, but there's

00:12.852 --> 00:21.224
just no feeling like it. I'll always be grateful 
that I went there and thankful that I went there.

00:26.391 --> 00:30.797
Grateful for the education, not in an academic 
sense, But the growth that I had that started there

00:32.836 --> 00:41.607
was nurtured in the military and then matured when 
I came back. The things that Anna has given me that I

00:43.169 --> 01:00.750
could never, ever have expected to have happen, 
the presidency of the association, the buster

00:43.169 --> 01:00.750
speak here once, poor job, but nonetheless did it. 
and then a graduation speaker.

01:05.828 --> 01:15.601
Ed Cooper, I always felt, one of the reasons I felt 
so close to Jack is that he instigated my selection

01:05.828 --> 01:15.601
as a graduation speaker. He insisted it was never 
him, but it was Ed Cooper, so I mean, I'll accept Ed

01:16.442 --> 01:22.990
Cooper, he's a good guy too. But between them, that 
was a, One of the, just, well, just something

01:26.954 --> 01:32.222
don't, few people have an opportunity to do. You 
know, something I never

01:33.064 --> 01:37.911
would have expected. You can't, you can't, 
there's just a debt there that you can never pay.

01:44.161 --> 01:47.487
Alright, what have I failed to ask about, to 
prompt? Well, in those years, I can't think of, I

01:47.567 --> 01:51.493
don't know. No student years. What else can we put 
in here about the student

01:54.570 --> 02:03.079
years? Obviously friends that you made, many of 
them stayed friends. We still see each other at

02:05.882 --> 02:10.046
reunions and don't see enough. That's life. 
That's the way it is.

02:17.774 --> 02:21.598
I think any problems that were there were probably 
self-created. I don't think that I can blame

02:23.148 --> 02:29.878
anything that happened on anybody but myself if 
there were any, whatever negatives were there.

02:32.041 --> 02:37.469
And hopefully they've all, anything that was bad 
that's been whitewashed by now. And it's just a

02:39.873 --> 02:41.976
tremendous, I don't know what else to tell you. 
Now, and there were no incidents, no tragedies

02:42.757 --> 02:51.450
that I can think of, any events, any fires, any? 
There was a couple of events back when I was a

02:52.021 --> 02:55.125
student that I had forgotten about. One time, we 
marched on the President's home. It was in the old

03:01.054 --> 03:08.565
President's home, across from the fountain. And 
we were objecting to something, probably the

03:08.585 --> 03:15.495
erosion of senior privileges. And I wasn't a 
senior then, so I don't really remember what it

03:16.075 --> 03:19.100
was. I think it had to do with his decision that all 
hazing etc would stop on a certain date? Well yeah

03:26.212 --> 03:37.870
and they took a lot of so-called senior privileges 
away and we didn't they didn't like that so of

03:26.212 --> 03:37.870
course we all marched over there and did riot. I 
mentioned this Saturday to Carkey and she said

03:37.890 --> 03:45.822
well you were among the first sit-ins and didn't 
know it and I guess we were and then we also went down

03:37.890 --> 03:45.822
to the then the administration building where the 
president had his office, and now the Jack K.

03:46.443 --> 03:53.532
Williams building, I'm proud to say. And we slept 
there one night, as I mentioned to you. We were

03:57.877 --> 04:07.750
objecting to probably again, oh, I think the first 
time was the fact that we were going to put freshmen

03:57.877 --> 04:07.750
at Bryan Field. It might have been it. I don't 
remember. Sure. What was the president's

04:10.453 --> 04:12.696
reaction to your report? Well, he came out and said 
something to us, and we went back to the dorm. I

04:17.341 --> 04:19.804
don't know. It might have been, too, that Colonel 
Malloy came out and said, get your panties back to

04:20.085 --> 04:25.392
the gun, too. I don't remember that either. Then 
when we went to the administration building, we

04:27.635 --> 04:32.743
actually spent the whole night there. And I slept 
on one of those steps going up to the president's

04:33.103 --> 04:37.429
office. I slept very well. And we made class the 
next morning, for sure. There was a newspaper

04:45.758 --> 04:54.129
article on that in the Houston section of the 
Chronicle or anyway, Houston Press is where it

04:45.758 --> 04:54.129
was. My picture was in there with some kind of 
quote, which I also sent to the court center for

04:55.271 --> 05:03.001
their archives. I don't remember what it said 
anymore.

05:08.929 --> 05:13.335
Do you think of any other topics that we want to 
include about your student days?

05:17.247 --> 05:26.159
No, but I'd

05:17.247 --> 05:26.159
like to think I'd do it all over again if I had to give 
any opportunity. There are very little things I

05:26.199 --> 05:29.524
would change. Obviously, I always think of 
something, but I know I could think of things I

05:30.766 --> 05:37.094
would change, but not an awful lot. It was just a 
wonderful year and wonderful experience. That's

05:41.280 --> 05:42.782
great.
