WEBVTT

00:02.393 --> 00:06.560
The individual holding both positions, of 
course, is obvious. He has so much unlimited

00:08.984 --> 00:11.168
control.

00:16.177 --> 00:25.853
The tie in between the two experiment stations is 
unusual in my mind for the president of the

00:16.177 --> 00:25.853
university.

00:28.195 --> 00:39.812
there's almost an open

00:28.195 --> 00:39.812
playground upon which to switch here and there and 
there and here.

00:43.478 --> 00:50.929
As

00:43.478 --> 00:50.929
you may recall, when I became chancellor, one of my

00:55.432 --> 01:01.574
the board said to me, Hubert, we want to build a 
strong system.

01:01.594 --> 01:03.421
You build it as strong as you can. It wasn't because 
of that reason that I recommended the change to

01:07.244 --> 01:35.850
them of separating out the Experiment Station and 
the Extension Service it was mainly because they

01:07.244 --> 01:35.850
were separate budget identities in the 
legislature and I didn't and they were as such

01:07.244 --> 01:35.850
I didn't think they should report through the 
Chief Executive Officer of another of another

01:07.244 --> 01:35.850
budget entity to get to where they're going too 
much opportunity to

01:38.783 --> 01:50.581
to use the money freely and

01:38.783 --> 01:50.581
Very little accountability for the research 
programs How is research doing? Are we earning our

01:51.443 --> 01:52.745
money? Is this piece of research producing 
something and I know you can't Particularly in

01:54.768 --> 02:02.881
basic research. You can't ask that question. I But 
in the applied research field, and much of ours was

02:06.121 --> 02:20.898
applied research, particularly in agriculture, 
to some extent in engineering, in applied

02:06.121 --> 02:20.898
research, it's easy to raise the question, how 
effective is it doing? Are you fulfilling your

02:21.919 --> 02:23.281
role? Is it quality material?

02:27.566 --> 02:29.588
Those questions weren't being asked. Back in the 
rudder williams years can you think of any

02:33.593 --> 03:01.288
opportunities that a m missed are there some 
things in hindsight that we could have done yes

02:33.593 --> 03:01.288
very quickly i can come to a big one and that's the 
university of texas at arlington

02:33.593 --> 03:01.288
which at one time as you know was a part of the a m 
system

03:04.964 --> 03:30.922
I think the relinquishing of that, almost 
voluntarily doing it, but in response, I think, to

03:04.964 --> 03:30.922
some protests from the Arlington people that they 
did not want to be associated with A&M, no one made

03:04.964 --> 03:30.922
an attempt, to my knowledge, to find out why and to 
correct it. I never heard of anything either. In

03:33.955 --> 03:36.118
fact, to my knowledge, nothing was done. Now, I 
understood from the far sidelines that some of the

03:37.139 --> 03:44.207
regents were happy to, quote, get rid of it. We can 
spend more money then on College Station.

03:51.536 --> 04:02.730
Whatever the cause, it was short-sighted to have 
an opportunity to be a part of the Metroplex

03:51.536 --> 04:02.730
system, Dallas-Fort Worth system, Wow. Right. 
Great opportunity. Did you ever hear of any,

04:09.564 --> 04:22.423
during your day, of any other institutions in the 
state that might have come under the A&M system

04:09.564 --> 04:22.423
umbrella?

04:26.148 --> 04:28.311
I heard talk at one time about Lamar. I can't 
remember from which it came. But the talk went

04:34.807 --> 04:36.749
along these lines. It's an engineering-oriented 
type institution. We would do well to have it as a

04:43.878 --> 04:54.991
part of this system, and it would give us a

04:43.878 --> 04:54.991
point of light in Southeast Texas. But that was the 
only one I recall hearing about. There was, I guess

04:58.956 --> 05:02.080
there was always some talk about the Valley 
Schools, but not very explicit, nothing

05:02.482 --> 05:09.231
tangible.

05:12.276 --> 05:28.438
Were there any, as you look back, are there any 
academic subject areas that Texas A&M

05:12.276 --> 05:28.438
University, you think, passed by that it might 
have added to the program here?

05:36.805 --> 06:06.053
should we have tried to become completely 
comprehensive

05:36.805 --> 06:06.053
but i think time will take care of some of that uh...

05:36.805 --> 06:06.053
i think david maxwell's

05:36.805 --> 06:06.053
locating and bringing to this campus The Nautical 
Archaeology Group was a great coup. He brought

06:12.420 --> 06:15.745
that thing totally intact and put it in here. I 
thought that was a sweeping success. I remember

06:20.712 --> 06:25.799
when, because Winerdi and I were part of that 
effort when those people came. Yeah, that was a

06:26.020 --> 06:29.344
great move for A&M. And...

06:35.547 --> 06:45.841
The Fine Arts program, of course, is one of 
continuing interest and I think, as I said, time

06:35.547 --> 06:45.841
will help with that.

06:50.848 --> 06:58.399
I recall shortly after I became Dean of Liberal 
Arts, I had a visit from two lady citizens of the

06:59.577 --> 07:12.131
College Station community who came to speak to me 
supporting

06:59.577 --> 07:12.131
further development in the fine arts.

07:16.276 --> 07:26.547
And I was totally supportive, but at that time I 
said, ladies,

07:16.276 --> 07:26.547
at this time, There is such a great pressure upon 
the resources of this university

07:28.822 --> 07:47.000
that I think there are other items, other areas 
which first must be sought and attained for us. And

07:47.020 --> 07:51.365
I named philosophy, for example, as one of them. 
And they agreed to that.

08:03.500 --> 08:18.576
I think the coordinating, well, I think among our 
own reviewing

08:03.500 --> 08:18.576
points along the way, fine arts proposals would 
have had early on considerable difficulty. And

08:20.698 --> 08:21.759
it's so costly. Huh? So costly for student credit 
hours. Yes, yes.

08:30.028 --> 08:31.650
Do you remember some people that we miss some 
individuals that got away or that we almost

08:32.963 --> 08:49.945
attracted some key individuals anywhere through 
the years.

08:59.657 --> 09:01.840
I remember a few early leavers But they were at 
retirement age. I'm thinking here of Clarence

09:05.609 --> 09:09.096
Zener, Horace Bowers. They stayed such a short 
time, Haskell. But we didn't lose them to someone

09:12.422 --> 09:14.225
else. Yes. They didn't stay here in the community. 
No, no. But I can't remember many people that were

09:19.374 --> 09:22.900
here. and another school hired them away and all of 
us said oh look what they accomplished there.

09:33.634 --> 09:44.845
What about looking now with a smile, do you 
remember some goofs, some flops, some failures by

09:33.634 --> 09:44.845
somewhere that you witnessed?

09:51.771 --> 09:53.713
I'm sure there are some along the way.

09:56.714 --> 10:07.606
All right, do you remember any proposals that you 
made at whatever level that you thought were

09:56.714 --> 10:07.606
important that were turned down?

10:16.216 --> 10:16.777
Oh, gee.

10:23.024 --> 10:25.166
Not here within the university, no. Okay. I can't 
think of anything. I tried to, Haskell, I tried to

10:28.163 --> 10:40.503
pick, judiciously pick the things to carry 
forward that I thought were winners.

10:42.807 --> 10:52.523
I've had people come to me from departments and 
from the faculty seeking this and that and that.

10:55.355 --> 11:24.602
I would I'd say yes that that sounds like an 
important opportunity I said but I'm faced with

10:55.355 --> 11:24.602
I'm faced with a budget hearing next week and I 
don't want to our next month or whenever and I can't

10:55.355 --> 11:24.602
put that into the mix of things right now

10:55.355 --> 11:24.602
as Dr. Williams became ill, do you remember your 
hearing of his illness, his heart attack? In

11:33.881 --> 11:34.462
Houston? Well, the night they flew him down there 
from here. I didn't know of that, Haskell. Oh, yes.

11:45.513 --> 11:55.163
Claude Goswick was a young, new doctor at the 
health center, and I interviewed a young lady

11:45.513 --> 11:55.163
reporter not so young anymore, for the battalion. 
And she said that one of the emergency crew told her

11:59.281 --> 12:07.994
when they got to the president's house that Dr. 
Williams' heart wasn't beating. I don't know this

12:09.056 --> 12:11.239
story at all. And then they take him to Houston, and 
he has another heart attack. And while DeBakey, do

12:16.367 --> 12:21.555
you remember how you heard about Dr. Williams' 
illness? No. I don't recall that. Were you aware

12:26.833 --> 12:32.346
beforehand, as you look back, were you aware that 
his strength was declining? No. I certainly

12:32.927 --> 12:33.890
wasn't. No. The interim president was Clyde 
Wells, wasn't it? Clyde Wells served as interim

12:42.376 --> 12:46.362
president and chairman of the board. What was 
that? What a cushy condition. What was that like

12:48.906 --> 12:52.632
for you key administrators on the campus? I just 
ignored it. Okay. Because there were no important

12:57.079 --> 13:03.669
policy matters during that period, were there? 
No. All right, then the presidency is separated

13:05.011 --> 13:10.560
from the chancellorship. and the board 
identifies a new president, did anybody consult

13:11.317 --> 13:21.270
with you as a dean for suggestion about a new 
president? No.

13:25.035 --> 13:29.100
What was the reaction of you and the other deans 
when Darvish was announced? Uncertainty

13:29.120 --> 13:34.287
and surprise. And then he selected Mac Prescott as 
his vice president. Yes. Did Mac change things

13:44.179 --> 13:47.764
much in his style from Dr. Calhoun? I

13:47.804 --> 14:01.000
think to some extent, yes.

14:09.907 --> 14:24.928
I was surprised that Mack as a vice president was,

14:09.907 --> 14:24.928
and as a scientist, biochemistry.

14:27.131 --> 14:38.547
To me, scientists, when addressed by a problem, 
scope it out pretty thoroughly.

14:39.775 --> 14:40.716
aspects of it.

14:46.305 --> 14:59.526
I felt that Mack was more monolithic in his 
handling

14:46.305 --> 14:59.526
problems. He would have, I don't want to say 
impulsive, but he would have

15:10.488 --> 15:25.466
he would reach a decision and that

15:10.488 --> 15:25.466
decision might be based upon one facet of a 
multifaceted situation. And I thought that was

15:25.486 --> 15:30.772
considerably different from Dr. Calhoun's 
style.

15:33.895 --> 15:39.482
When Dr. Williams took the job in Houston, A new 
chancellor of the system was identified. What can

15:46.889 --> 15:52.536
you share with this machine about that process and 
how you were selected?

15:59.946 --> 16:08.457
I really don't

15:59.946 --> 16:08.457
know exactly how my name came before the board.

16:10.934 --> 16:22.546
I suspect to some extent that Bob Cherry

16:10.934 --> 16:22.546
may have at least placed my name, among others, 
before the board for consideration. I was also

16:24.688 --> 16:36.159
told by Clyde Wells later on that Dr. Williams had 
given him two names in the event something

16:24.688 --> 16:36.159
happened to him. One was John Calhoun, the other 
was Frank Hubert.

16:44.363 --> 16:49.889
As

16:44.363 --> 16:49.889
far as you're aware, did they even consider 
Calhoun? I don't know. I've never heard, I don't

16:51.350 --> 16:52.952
know.

16:59.638 --> 17:01.941
I think it was a Tuesday morning that they met. I 
returned from East

17:01.961 --> 17:14.033
Texas State University where I had been 
consulting The day before, got home, oh, 9

17:15.127 --> 17:22.234
or 10 o'clock. Mary Julia said, Frank, Mr. Clyde 
Wells has called from the board and invited you to

17:23.516 --> 17:32.044
have breakfast with him tomorrow morning. I said, 
fine, okay. I thought, I knew they were in a search,

17:35.308 --> 17:40.493
and I thought they were going to ask me to give them 
some advice on search procedures. I had consulted

17:45.376 --> 17:56.648
some with other institutions and with local 
school districts on such matters, and I thought

17:45.376 --> 17:56.648
maybe that was the basis for my being invited to 
breakfast with them. Well, I went to breakfast.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.518
Nice, congenial

18:08.063 --> 18:19.619
After breakfast, Mr. Wells said, you're aware of 
the fact that we're in a search for a new

18:08.063 --> 18:19.619
chancellor, and we'd like to offer you the job. 
Just bang like that.

18:26.068 --> 18:32.957
Well, I was really

18:26.068 --> 18:32.957
caught by surprise, Haskell, startled.

18:36.852 --> 18:40.457
I said, I have two questions.

18:43.561 --> 18:47.046
First, have you discussed this with President 
Williams? And they said no.

18:53.475 --> 18:54.696
Wait, you said Williams. Huh? You said Williams. 
President Miller. President Miller, have you

18:58.756 --> 19:02.680
discussed this with President Miller? And they 
said no, rather emphatically.

19:10.527 --> 19:24.561
I next asked if they were aware that I would reach 
the age 65 the following summer and would be very

19:10.527 --> 19:24.561
likely retired.

19:27.747 --> 19:32.294
They said, we're aware of that, but it's not a 
concern of ours. And I recall Al Davies said, you

19:34.117 --> 19:40.989
can go to 70 as far as I'm concerned. Now, this was 
what year? This was 79. This is September of 79,

19:45.416 --> 19:51.105
Haskell.

20:01.058 --> 20:03.561
I said, when would you expect me to start? And they 
said, tomorrow. I said, well, I'm scheduled to

20:08.707 --> 20:19.940
leave tomorrow to go to the University of Georgia 
and make a speech over a two-day period to a group

20:08.707 --> 20:19.940
there in education. And then I'll return. I said, 
what would, I think October the 1st was the

20:22.163 --> 20:29.071
following Monday. I said, how about that? Okay.

20:33.728 --> 20:36.913
So that took place. I went back to the office, told 
Peggy, call Mary Julia first,

20:37.814 --> 20:55.281
and that's the way it happened.

21:02.602 --> 21:07.568
It was a strange situation, Haskell, in a way. And 
it was truly just completely a bolt out of the blue.

21:15.877 --> 21:20.682
I had no idea, had not ever given it any 
consideration whatsoever. And you're implying

21:21.143 --> 21:24.386
made not any effort. No, none at all. None 
whatsoever. No phone calls, no third-party

21:29.052 --> 21:32.035
involvement. aloof. I wasn't a part of that.

21:39.255 --> 21:59.355
I

21:39.255 --> 21:59.355
have the impression as an observer as dean of 
faculties then that fairly soon there were some

21:39.255 --> 21:59.355
disagreements between you and President Miller 
about where the stations and the services

21:39.255 --> 21:59.355
reported.

22:04.837 --> 22:05.798
Is that correct? Absolutely. The board asked me to 
bring in a proposed organization plan for the

22:08.601 --> 22:15.549
system.

22:18.473 --> 22:30.827
And I did this on my own, by myself, without 
consulting key staff in the chancellor's office,

22:18.473 --> 22:30.827
Freeman or Bond or Cherry or whomever.

22:34.823 --> 22:46.243
I have a background to some extent in graduate 
studies in public administration.

22:50.731 --> 22:53.676
I believed then as I believe today. that a separate 
budget entity of the state of Texas should not

22:55.310 --> 23:09.936
report to its governing board through another 
budget entity.

23:09.956 --> 23:18.111
I'm aware of the fact of the close relationship 
between University and Experiment Station. But

23:20.318 --> 23:32.415
I'm also aware of the fact of a total lack of 
accountability, in my view, Haskell, of what's

23:20.318 --> 23:32.415
going on in the experiment station. It's all one 
happy family, either in engineering or in

23:33.337 --> 23:45.194
agriculture.

23:45.214 --> 23:48.098
That plus the fact that each of these entities 
makes its own presentation to the legislature for

23:49.816 --> 24:05.239
its funding as a separate budget entity, 
sometimes with support from the president, but

23:49.816 --> 24:05.239
not always, not often.

24:09.406 --> 24:16.937
So for the reason of

24:09.406 --> 24:16.937
direct reporting to your governing board, and the 
accountability of your programs.

24:26.368 --> 24:39.632
I felt that the service agencies, if they are to 
remain separate budget entities,

24:26.368 --> 24:39.632
should report to their governing board direct. In 
other words, through the chancellor's office.

24:47.377 --> 24:49.440
Jarvis and O.D. Butler. O.D., I think, had a pretty 
strong influence on Jarvis.

24:57.592 --> 24:58.734
Jarvis and O.D. vehemently opposed.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.803
Don't fix it if it ain't broke.

25:07.887 --> 25:09.430
I gave them my rationale. And I told Jarvis, I said, 
I'm going to present this to the board. had it all

25:16.081 --> 25:42.915
mapped out,

25:16.081 --> 25:42.915
and had, I thought, a cohesive coordinating 
group, which I called the

25:16.081 --> 25:42.915
Joint Committee on Agency and University 
Relationships, the JAGWR.

25:46.895 --> 26:16.868
I, which was comprised of the president of the 
university as a presiding officer, the four

25:46.895 --> 26:16.868
directors of the experiment stations and 
extension services, the dean of, the vice

25:46.895 --> 26:16.868
president of the university,

25:46.895 --> 26:16.868
a couple of other representatives from the 
university, and from the chancellor's office,

25:46.895 --> 26:16.868
Clyde Freeman, and James Bond. I said this and I 
laid out the duties of that group there to meet

26:21.166 --> 26:35.584
monthly on matters relating to university agency 
relationships in three areas. First, programs.

26:39.069 --> 26:44.155
How shall the agencies support the programs of the 
university and vice versa? And what shall the

26:45.029 --> 26:46.511
programs be? What shall our effort be for the next 
biennium? Personnel, staffing programs, and

26:50.878 --> 26:55.165
facilities. Where shall they live? And you guys 
make the recommendations to the chancellor's

26:59.832 --> 27:07.364
office, and I'll take them to the board with your 
strong support. However, if any single one of you,

27:08.385 --> 27:13.213
I don't care who among you,

27:16.163 --> 27:19.808
doesn't like the idea and doesn't accept it, you 
can veto it. One person veto, in which case the

27:20.468 --> 27:26.636
matter comes to the chancellor direct and I'll 
make the decision. God, I said, but the university

27:28.338 --> 27:32.483
president will chair this thing. Jarvis never 
called a meeting.

27:41.114 --> 27:44.398
Well, he didn't like the idea. And I told him, when I 
took him a copy of it, I said, Jarvis, I'm going to

27:44.834 --> 27:51.545
take this to the board. Between now and then, I do 
not want you to lobby any single member of the

27:52.527 --> 27:56.934
board. You stay away from them. You can make your 
own presentation to the board when you're ready,

28:00.400 --> 28:06.811
but I don't want you lobbying them beforehand. He 
didn't do it, but he sent O.D.,

28:14.483 --> 28:29.640
especially to agricultural-oriented people 
like the guy up at DeKalb, the banker at DeKalb,

28:14.483 --> 28:29.640
Texas, a forgotten little gray-headed fellow, 
nice guy, great guy. And he raised questions about

28:31.342 --> 28:40.052
the

28:31.342 --> 28:40.052
reorganization.

28:43.390 --> 28:52.265
I felt it was just too easy, you know, if a guy 
doesn't have a research project this year, we'll

28:43.390 --> 28:52.265
put him over here in teaching somewhere. 
Teaching's got more money than it can use. We'll

28:55.791 --> 28:58.175
put some research people on teaching money. 
Incidentally, my second year in office at the

28:58.796 --> 29:04.386
chancellor's office, you might punch this off 
here. This was then in this disagreement over

29:06.695 --> 29:18.286
organization and reporting authority was in late 
79 and early 80.

29:23.550 --> 29:24.211
I guess yes. All right. I remember coming to chat 
with you to say goodbye late in June of 1980. One

29:35.541 --> 29:36.162
morning before driving toward El Paso. And you 
asked me about who the best deans were, I mean best

29:40.835 --> 29:46.180
department heads were on the campus. And you 
particularly singled out engineering and then

29:48.122 --> 29:52.226
you asked me about Chuck Sampson. And I gave you a 
very vague answer because at that point he was no

29:53.388 --> 29:59.134
longer a department head. And then I learned two 
days later that Dr. Miller, had been terminated.

30:09.478 --> 30:13.603
Can you share any information about how that 
decision came to be made? Yes.

30:22.635 --> 30:25.098
Let me go back a ways before that.

30:28.182 --> 30:31.647
For what purposes or what reasons I do not know.

30:37.060 --> 30:38.422
Where are we? That the board apparently had 
reached a decision that they thought a chain was in

30:39.222 --> 30:47.712
order. Is that correct? Yes. That was clear. And

30:52.818 --> 31:02.629
I talked to the president about it, advised him of 
it.

31:07.807 --> 31:09.210
I had a visit from O.D. Butler saying, Frank,

31:09.251 --> 31:20.719
you've got to protect the president.
