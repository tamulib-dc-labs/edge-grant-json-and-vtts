WEBVTT

00:03.777 --> 00:08.003
Okay, let's try a volume check.

00:10.948 --> 00:18.359
Okay, this is Ron Shorn, and I'm interviewing Jack 
Brandt, and for the record, give your full name. My

00:18.379 --> 00:19.681
entire full name? John Conrad Brandt, Jr. Okay, 
and when were you born? I was born on... Well,

00:26.251 --> 00:32.400
that's actually a tricky question, but it will... 
To give you insight into how my life has gone, I was

00:32.650 --> 00:39.000
actually born on August 7th, 1934. Both my mother 
and father agreed that I was born on August 7th,

00:41.004 --> 00:45.130
1934. However, the city of St. Louis says I was born 
on August 8th, 1934. So it turns out I ran afoul of

00:52.867 --> 01:02.917
bureaucracy, essentially, on square one, and 
have been running afoul of bureaucracies ever

00:52.867 --> 01:02.917
since. How did you get interested in astronomy?

01:08.262 --> 01:18.452
You know, that is really hard to say, but it's the 
kind of thing that I think is very unnatural to

01:08.262 --> 01:18.452
people. The specific thing that I can remember is 
writing a paper very early in my college career on

01:18.685 --> 01:36.823
the determination of the speed of light by Ole 
Womer and whoever worked with him from the

01:18.685 --> 01:36.823
satellites of Jupiter. And I was impressed that 
such a basically simple approach to a fairly

01:38.005 --> 01:48.135
fundamental observation could yield ballpark 
the correct results. And this idea of being able to

01:51.110 --> 02:03.782
use your wits to determine what's going on in a 
cosmic sense appealed to me, and I guess it was

01:51.110 --> 02:03.782
downhill from there on. Where'd you get your 
undergraduate degree and when? Undergraduate

02:07.346 --> 02:11.410
degree at Washington University in St. Louis in 
1956. And what was your major? Mathematics. Okay,

02:15.193 --> 02:16.975
and then where'd you go to grad school? I went to 
grad school twice. The first time was at the

02:19.067 --> 02:28.720
University of Chicago, 56 to 60, when I got a 
degree, PhD in astronomy. And then due to various

02:30.082 --> 02:46.624
malfeasances of the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration from 1981 to 1983, I went to

02:30.082 --> 02:46.624
graduate school at Loyola College in Baltimore 
and obtained a Master of Business

02:30.082 --> 02:46.624
Administration. Who was your thesis advisor? 
What was your thesis? My thesis was on different

02:50.493 --> 02:57.763
ways of producing Lyman-alpha radiation in the 
solar system. This included some planets and

02:57.863 --> 03:06.895
what was then called the interplanetary medium. 
The solar wind hadn't actually been fully

03:06.915 --> 03:09.699
invented yet. It was around but not used. And my 
thesis advisor was Joseph Chamberlain. How did

03:16.304 --> 03:18.927
you get interested in that field? Did they pick 
you, or did you go around and pick something else?

03:22.551 --> 03:23.993
It was sort of a little bit of both. When I first went 
to Yerkes, I was, of course, taking courses. And I

03:29.519 --> 03:40.351
had a one-year research assistantship on the 
astrometry project that was being run by Kai

03:29.519 --> 03:40.351
Strand at the time. And I quickly determined that I 
was not all that interested in astrometry. And

03:46.072 --> 03:55.567
this guy named Joe Chamberlain seemed to be doing 
interesting physics in the atmospheres of

03:46.072 --> 03:55.567
planets, and he was also working on solar wind 
theory at the time. So the juncture was natural,

03:55.688 --> 03:59.995
and I think he's been very productive.

04:02.699 --> 04:04.222
Where did you go after you got your PhD? The first 
year after the PhD, I was something called an NSF

04:04.883 --> 04:12.535
cooperative.

04:15.755 --> 04:19.039
Cooperative, oh boy, it's been a long time. But 
some kind of postdoctoral fellowship that

04:20.220 --> 04:29.611
involved the postdoctoral institution 
contributing resources and NSF paid the salary.

04:30.332 --> 04:37.660
And that was essentially late 60 to late 61 at Mount 
Wilson and Palomar, literally on 813 Santa

04:30.332 --> 04:37.660
Barbara Street. And where'd you go from there? 
Then I came to Berkeley. How long did you stay

04:42.366 --> 04:43.046
there? I stayed here a year and a half. And then I 
went to Kitt Peak in early 63 and stayed there for

04:44.746 --> 04:50.875
three years. And then in 66, I went to the Goddard 
Institute for Space Studies and stayed there

04:52.198 --> 04:59.809
about a year. And they were then trying to get 
people to go to Goddard and run things. So I started

05:06.540 --> 05:11.327
out in the solar physics branch in 1967 as Ed was the 
technical title, and then I was made Chief of the

05:12.050 --> 05:16.897
Laboratory for Solar Physics. And that evolved 
and amalgamated, and for about the last 10 years at

05:17.818 --> 05:31.196
Goddard, which ended in 87, so from 77 to 87, I was 
Chief of the Laboratory for Astronomy and Solar

05:17.818 --> 05:31.196
Physics. And then you wrote, and then you went? And 
then I went to the University of Colorado, where I

05:35.442 --> 05:41.230
am Senior Research Associate and Professor 
Perrin Attendant Rank, close Perrin. I'm just,

05:46.349 --> 05:47.991
I'm not making this up. I'll give you my card if you 
don't believe it, of Astrophysical, Planetary,

05:48.691 --> 05:53.837
and Atmospheric Sciences. We require 
documentation for that, so you want to save some

05:55.058 --> 06:03.547
tape.

06:03.567 --> 06:05.509
Okay, do you consider yourself an astronomer? 
Yeah. And if you consider yourself a solar system

06:06.758 --> 06:12.589
astronomer, a solar system or planetary 
astronomer or just a plain astronomer? I consider

06:13.551 --> 06:14.372
both. Usually the world, for reasons which are not 
sound, describes all astronomers into solar

06:16.336 --> 06:27.076
system people and the equivalent of 
astrophysicists. I am both. Back in the

06:31.058 --> 06:40.368
early 60s, did you feel looked down upon by real 
quote-unquote astronomers? Well, I'm

06:40.388 --> 06:45.073
absolutely sure that real astronomers tried to 
look down on me, but I didn't let them. And I'm being

06:45.593 --> 06:48.276
slightly serious. I, for quite some time, have 
chosen the things to work on that I was interested

06:48.997 --> 06:57.606
in for what I perceived to be their intrinsic merit 
and interest to me. And if somebody else doesn't

06:59.690 --> 07:04.557
think that's important, that's, in my personal 
opinion, their problem. Do you think that real

07:04.577 --> 07:13.570
astronomers look down on planetary anything 
closer in the light year, back in the 60s? And do

07:13.590 --> 07:14.331
they do it now? Well, they certainly did in the 60s.

07:19.318 --> 07:26.648
But this is simply a mental aberration that should 
not be unduly dignified. There is a huge tendency

07:27.218 --> 07:38.292
in astronomy for anybody working in any field to 
regard anything that that person is not

07:27.218 --> 07:38.292
personally working on as unimportant. I think it 
far transcends the astrophysicist looking down

07:38.772 --> 07:52.389
on the solar system people, and you can even take it 
further, and then you get into the

07:38.772 --> 07:52.389
astrophysicist, the people that work on 
cosmology and quasars look down on the stellar

07:38.772 --> 07:52.389
people. And it's sort of another form of prejudice 
in our society that shouldn't be unduly

07:57.458 --> 07:58.959
dignified. What was astronomy and planetary 
astronomy like when you got started as opposed to

07:59.020 --> 08:04.365
today? I don't know about as opposed to today. We 
were just starting to get into missions to

08:08.068 --> 08:12.673
planets, which of course were very exciting. And a 
lot of the work that I did first with Joe

08:13.874 --> 08:24.124
Chamberlain with myself was some of the first work 
done on, for example, Lyman Alpha from the

08:13.874 --> 08:24.124
planets. Half of my astronomer friends didn't 
know what Lyman Alpha was, which I found somewhat

08:24.442 --> 08:30.587
amusing. But I'm sorry. I tilted it back at the 
wrong time. Yeah, go ahead. What's the best piece

08:36.192 --> 08:37.993
of work that you think you've done? It had to be 
carved on a tombstone.

08:44.599 --> 08:48.722
That would be awfully hard to pin down. As you know, 
Ron, my approach to astronomy has been somewhat

08:48.742 --> 08:54.347
eclectic. I've done archaeoastronomy. I've done 
rotation curves of galaxies, fiddled with the GUM

08:56.554 --> 09:01.279
nebula. I was the principal investigator for the 
GHRS, which has contributed to lots of

09:01.299 --> 09:09.329
disciplines. I have helped found the 
International Halley Watch. I helped start the

09:14.315 --> 09:19.761
Solar Maximum Mission. Anything that I have done, 
the more recent stuff that I'm doing right now, I'm

09:20.011 --> 09:25.859
as proud of as anything. That is, I think we have 
pinned down to within all a reasonable doubt what

09:25.899 --> 09:38.656
the source of disconnection events in comets 
might be. And the answer is magnetic reconnection

09:39.958 --> 09:44.584
of sector boundaries. which is what we proposed 15 
years ago, but we didn't have, that was a good

09:45.155 --> 09:50.983
speculation, we didn't have the evidence to back 
it up. I think we have the evidence now, but it's

09:51.003 --> 09:56.790
sort of like asking somebody what their favorite 
child is. I view whatever my contribution is to

09:56.810 --> 10:11.729
astronomy to be in multiple areas, including 
trying to run a NASA laboratory intelligently,

09:56.810 --> 10:11.729
helping sell missions. I think 50 years from now, 
Stuff I did on the International Halley Watch may

10:14.838 --> 10:18.183
be what I'm remembered by. I really don't know. 
What was the most fun?

10:26.454 --> 10:28.357
Well, you know, that is very hard to say. I think 
selling the GHRS, because everybody told us...

10:31.161 --> 10:35.066
Which is the... Goddard high-resolution 
spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope.

10:35.106 --> 10:42.837
Everybody told us in 1976 and 1977 that a proposal 
from a NASA lab didn't have a chance of a snowball,

10:35.106 --> 10:42.837
and you know where... And, of course, we were 
category one and selected, and it's up and

10:43.373 --> 10:47.479
working. So, again, when you want singles, you 
know, I'll tell you stuff that I consider to be

10:47.539 --> 10:56.833
exciting and productive, but it's hard to pin 
down. Do you ever have any dead ends, misfires,

10:56.853 --> 11:00.819
things like that? Sure, dead ends and misfires. I 
had a most wonderful theory of the blue clearing on

11:02.742 --> 11:06.487
Mars. That would be totally wrong. But it was a 
great theory. What was it? Well, at that time,

11:13.822 --> 11:21.250
there was evidence, which we now know to be false, 
that the solar wind might stop around 2 AU. And so we

11:22.331 --> 11:29.680
postulated that it stopped, obviously, around 
the orbit of Mars and that the eccentricity would

11:22.331 --> 11:29.680
carry it in and out of this boundary. Absolutely 
wonderful theory that had nothing to do with

11:30.320 --> 11:34.105
reality. When did you first cross swords with an 
ASA? your first official contact. Yeah, I

11:40.454 --> 11:48.383
wouldn't say that I had crossed swords with NASA, 
although NASA might have an older to do.

11:52.968 --> 12:08.325
Well, I was, whilst at Kitt Peak, involved with, I 
think it was Mariner 4, with an experiment that

11:52.968 --> 12:08.325
Charlie Barth was doing when he was still at JPL. 
Now, I may have this a little garbled, because as

12:09.385 --> 12:14.370
you know, that was 30 years ago. And

12:14.410 --> 12:21.417
something happened, and we were all summarily 
tossed off the mission. And it apparently

12:21.437 --> 12:27.183
bothered Charlie so much that he moved to the 
University of Colorado, where he was my director

12:21.437 --> 12:27.183
for five years. That was probably it, my first one. 
But clearly, when I became a NASA employee and a

12:32.449 --> 12:38.515
NASA

12:39.237 --> 12:44.923
branch head and then a lab chief, it was a long 
interaction for about 20 years. And I will say it

12:45.864 --> 12:52.191
was only towards the end that the cost-benefit 
ratio went strongly unfavorable. In the 60s, if

12:52.891 --> 12:59.539
you were in NASA and had good ideas and were willing 
to work hard, you could get really neat things

12:52.891 --> 12:59.539
done. Like we sold the SMM mission. Solar Maxwell 
mission. Yeah, sorry. So we sold that, and I think

13:06.025 --> 13:08.468
it's been one of the most productive solar 
missions around. And then we were done with that,

13:10.185 --> 13:15.532
and we sold the Goddard high resolution 
spectrograph. And it helped start the Halley

13:15.652 --> 13:17.815
watch. And you can go down the list. But now, 
generally speaking, even if you have a good idea

13:19.277 --> 13:24.765
and you're willing to work hard, it doesn't 
matter. It's not going to happen anyway. In

13:28.790 --> 13:33.236
general, do you think NASA's handled planetary 
science good or bad?

13:36.341 --> 13:38.083
Or average? Let's start with the pluses, and then 
we'll try to draw a conclusion. It's done a lot. I

13:43.940 --> 13:53.569
mean, we've had missions to Mercury and Venus and 
Mars and Jupiter and Uranus, Saturn, Neptune. So,

13:53.589 --> 14:00.695
you know, it's hard to fault the accomplishments, 
in my opinion, of the NASA Planet missions. You

14:00.715 --> 14:05.860
know, missions to the moon, we've got rocks and a 
whole bit, and Mars observers on its way. It

14:06.953 --> 14:08.935
doesn't have any significant problems that I know 
of. And Galileo's one as well. It does have a

14:10.117 --> 14:14.622
significant problem, but you can probably recoup 
a fair amount of that. I've heard a number of people

14:15.142 --> 14:25.514
say that NASA gets the pretty pictures and then 
cuts off the money before the data is really

14:15.142 --> 14:25.514
properly examined and published. Is that true? I 
think you can take two views of that, and then let's

14:26.315 --> 14:31.341
try to decide which is correct. There's certainly 
that tendency, and especially under the new

14:32.468 --> 14:49.544
administrator, Daniel Golden, I think there is 
even more than normal an inclination to launch

14:32.468 --> 14:49.544
something and skim the cream and then declare 
victory and go home. The old NASA motto among the

14:50.545 --> 15:01.716
troops was build it, launch it, and forget it, and 
I'm afraid we're going back to that under the

14:50.545 --> 15:01.716
management that's been around for the last 10 
years or so. largely involving people like Ren

15:01.882 --> 15:26.556
Fisk, I think there was a tendency to understand 
that when you build something like this, that the

15:01.882 --> 15:26.556
risk part was in the building, testing, and 
launching, and that the mission part, so-called

15:01.882 --> 15:26.556
M-O-N-D-A in NASA parlance, mission operations 
and data analysis, is the good part, the cream

15:01.882 --> 15:26.556
skimming the gravy. But regrettably, I think 
we're going back to that. So I think it is a real

15:31.124 --> 15:33.807
problem. The thought of turning off things like 
Magellan I think sets a precedent which I really

15:35.509 --> 15:42.338
don't even want to think about. But it is almost 
surely going to happen. So I would say that NASA, up

15:45.321 --> 15:55.073
until semi-recently, has improved in that area 
over the early days. But now they seem to be

15:55.814 --> 15:57.977
regressing backward into the old build, launch, 
and forget syndrome. Where do you think planetary

16:05.447 --> 16:11.897
astronomy would be today without the money that 
NASA's put into it? We wouldn't even recognize it.

16:15.783 --> 16:21.772
We've gone places and seen things that we just 
absolutely could not do from Earth. We do a lot from

16:22.192 --> 16:23.374
Earth. Having a mix of ground-based and space and 
in situ and theory and all of the above is the way you

16:23.945 --> 16:34.479
make progress. Do you feel that people at 
headquarters in the past and in the present really

16:34.539 --> 16:40.287
understand what the troops in the field are doing? 
Do they keep up with the science? I really don't

16:44.252 --> 16:46.295
know how to answer that. I deal mostly now in my 
astrophysical hat with Ed Weiler. who is very

16:54.235 --> 17:16.760
knowledgeable about what's going on, and with, in 
my planetary hat, with Jurgen Rahi, who I would say

16:54.235 --> 17:16.760
the same thing, but they are in an environment 
which is, I think, charitably fire drill

16:54.235 --> 17:16.760
oriented, and whether they can spend enough time 
to keep fully up to date, I don't know, but I think

16:54.235 --> 17:16.760
they make a very good effort. Whether the top, 
remember this is the discipline chief level, And

17:23.412 --> 17:29.161
these people invariably are or were active 
scientists. And I think their ability to keep up

17:29.882 --> 17:36.413
with what's going on is relatively good. As you 
then go higher in the NASA hierarchy, where

17:36.913 --> 17:50.635
frankly most of the decisions are made, I think the 
organization tends to be out of touch with

17:36.913 --> 17:50.635
anything outside the beltway. 30 years ago, there 
was just an American Astronomical Society. Now

17:55.627 --> 17:58.129
there are all these sub-societies. And the first 
one, I guess, was the Division of Planetary

17:58.149 --> 18:01.111
Sciences. Has that been a good thing or a bad thing 
for A, planetary astronomy, and B, astronomy in

18:01.512 --> 18:07.757
general? I am one of the last holdouts against the 
Division of Planetary Sciences. I only joined

18:15.364 --> 18:16.845
last year. I believe that the... The division does 
serve a useful purpose in bringing everybody

18:21.007 --> 18:36.930
together, and I now religiously go to the 
meetings, but I think it has also further helped to

18:21.007 --> 18:36.930
drive the wedge between the planetary community 
and the other community. They never did talk very

18:37.511 --> 18:42.118
much to each other, even back when we were grad 
school. But this sort of makes it official.

18:47.247 --> 18:54.473
30 years ago, Icarus was an obscure journal 
publishing obscure papers by Bulgarians,

18:47.247 --> 18:54.473
Austrian mechanics, and you've got to give Carl 
Sagan credit. He really changed that around. Do

18:57.235 --> 19:00.458
you happen to know who wrote the first paper in 
Icarus? Well, you did. Yeah, thank you. I'm

19:03.861 --> 19:06.443
talking about the majority of papers, all right? 
It turns out that paper was wrong, incidentally,

19:06.463 --> 19:13.329
which came to a shock to Joe Burns. Do you think the 
rise of Icarus has been a good thing? I mean, we

19:17.403 --> 19:20.786
don't see planetary papers in the APJ anymore, not 
that we saw a whole lot of them. Well, I still

19:20.846 --> 19:31.756
publish some of my planetary papers in APJ, and I 
publish some in ICRIS, and I publish some in AJ, and

19:20.846 --> 19:31.756
I plan to publish some in ANA. As I described 
earlier, a lot of this work I've been doing with DEs

19:32.837 --> 19:39.664
and the Halley data has all come to fruition, so 
there's a flock of papers coming out. ANA is?

19:40.365 --> 19:44.068
Astronomy and Astrophysics, the so-called 
European Journal. which is about international

19:45.078 --> 19:48.061
or anything. I think Icarus has been turned into a 
first-rate journal. Whether or not those papers

19:55.410 --> 20:01.657
would have been published anywhere, somewhere 
else, I couldn't possibly tell you. Do you think,

20:01.677 --> 20:11.589
take this meeting out, do you think the 
astronomers here, this is your personal opinion

20:01.677 --> 20:11.589
again, that they look down on planetary astronomy 
now, is there a grudging acceptance, is there a

20:01.677 --> 20:11.589
wholehearted acceptance? I honestly don't know. 
And that stems from not caring. Some may. I'm sure

20:17.239 --> 20:18.780
there's something to do. But so what? Here's a 
particular and a general question. The

20:25.027 --> 20:30.753
particular one is, what's the reaction you get 
from people you meet on the airplane when you tell

20:25.027 --> 20:30.753
them you're an astronomer? Oh, that's easy. When I 
tell them I'm an astronomer, it's wonderful. When

20:34.357 --> 20:36.820
I tell them I work on Hubble, it's not so wonderful. 
And for the first year or so after the spherical

20:37.829 --> 20:44.419
aberration was discovered, I did not volunteer 
that information. Things have, the general

20:44.959 --> 20:54.513
public perception has improved to the point where 
I can now volunteer it without risking, you know,

20:44.959 --> 20:54.513
three hours with the person next to you beating you 
over the head verbally. What do you think the

20:55.475 --> 21:00.942
public's general attitude towards planetary 
astronomy and astronomy in general? I think the

21:01.063 --> 21:07.532
public has fantastic support for the general 
mission of astronomy in general and of NASA. in

21:07.833 --> 21:14.520
terms of exploration of space and orbiting 
observatories in particular. I find that it's the

21:15.782 --> 21:22.029
political process where the support tends to 
weaken. But I give lots of public talks. I

21:26.153 --> 21:32.220
personally figure I'm supported by public monies 
and giving talks on my comic work, Hubble and

21:32.622 --> 21:37.832
whatever else is part of the territory, and I find 
tremendous reception. Do you think planetary

21:37.993 --> 21:45.708
astronomers in particular and astronomers in 
general have done as good a job as they could in

21:37.993 --> 21:45.708
selling themselves to the public in Congress? 
Undoubtedly not. No question.

21:52.722 --> 21:53.483
On the other hand, Would you agree that there's 
probably more realization now that we're getting

21:53.682 --> 22:00.170
paid by the public and we've got to tell them? Is 
that true? Would you go along with that?

22:04.516 --> 22:06.038
I doubt that, actually. I think in some levels that 
is well-perceived. But I continue to meet people

22:08.521 --> 22:14.909
who regard their intellectual inquiry almost as a 
divine right. Just give me the money and don't ask

22:15.750 --> 22:17.372
questions. Exactly. I'm smart. I'm uncovering 
the secrets of the universe. Send the check. How

22:23.483 --> 22:26.606
good a job have we done with the Congress? We've 
probably done even worse with the Congress. We

22:30.109 --> 22:44.963
tend, like almost all segments of U.S. society, to 
respond only to, at 11.59 on a scale of 12 o'clock,

22:30.109 --> 22:44.963
to impending disasters. When something that's 
near and dear to our heart is about to be canceled,

22:45.683 --> 22:53.170
we spring into action, but we don't do the homework 
that would have prevented us from getting in that

22:53.453 --> 22:55.615
situation in the first place? Well, we haven't 
found life anywhere, any trace of evidence of life

22:57.677 --> 23:05.925
anywhere in the solar system except where we know 
it is on Earth. Do we? Well, we haven't found it yet.

23:08.608 --> 23:11.030
What's the evidence for it? All right. Has that had 
any effect on funding and public interest, the

23:13.773 --> 23:21.020
fact that, for example, there are emersions?

23:21.040 --> 23:21.520
I doubt it. You know, these are, quote, finding of 
life, unquote, is such a long shot. I think most

23:30.024 --> 23:32.047
people understand what the odds are. A lot of 
people have gotten a lot of publicity and money, I

23:32.067 --> 23:45.270
guess, lately, pushing topics like killer 
asteroids, ozone holes, search for

23:32.067 --> 23:45.270
extraterrestrial intelligence, other solar 
systems. You think they're overdoing it?

23:51.487 --> 23:56.414
Let me just comment on the killer asteroid 
syndrome. Nothing that I personally know of

23:58.237 --> 24:03.305
that's being done there is bad science. In fact, 
there's a lot of good science there. And it's an

24:06.229 --> 24:07.952
area that I have some interest. I am trying to get 
modest funding to do searches for small comets. It

24:13.941 --> 24:19.890
turns out that really is a different problem if you 
read the space watch survey carefully. I believe,

24:21.440 --> 24:29.691
however, that Congress is funding it for what they 
believe to be the danger to Earth. And although

24:30.712 --> 24:35.378
there clearly is a danger to Earth, I think that is 
probably overblown. It probably won't do any harm

24:36.940 --> 24:38.823
either.

24:41.726 --> 24:47.093
What killed planetary, essentially killed 
planetary astronomy earlier in the century? Is it

24:47.113 --> 24:49.236
just personal oil that we run out of? I really don't 
know the answer to that question. Partly the

24:54.895 --> 25:03.465
reason I don't like to put, don't know, but even if I 
thought I did, a lot of these things tend to go in

24:54.895 --> 25:03.465
cycles. And it's sort of like education, you know, 
we use phonics and then it's whatever, whatever,

25:05.287 --> 25:10.292
whatever. So I don't take short-term 
fluctuations too seriously. And I think under the

25:13.776 --> 25:18.902
last 20, 25 years with NASA and all of the direct 
missions that we, planetary astronomy, may have

25:19.540 --> 25:27.248
gotten the lion's share of something, and if it 
goes back the other way, so what? What's the state

25:29.610 --> 25:31.592
of planetary astronomy today? Plus, minus, zero? 
I still think it's a plus.

25:38.720 --> 25:43.945
And keeping it a plus, in my view, depends on Three 
things. Continued vitality at the young

25:46.533 --> 25:50.257
investigator level. In other words, enough funds 
to keep a crop of fresh blood, fresh ideas coming

25:50.717 --> 26:00.028
into the field. The development, that's one. Two 
is the development of good ground-based

26:03.191 --> 26:09.498
capabilities for observations of planets. And 
the third is keeping a reasonable semblance of the

26:11.684 --> 26:14.587
space program going. Of the three, I worry most 
about the last one, number three. But they're all

26:20.272 --> 26:23.635
intertwined at a rather good level. And so even as 
we speak, again, we have Galileo and Mars

26:25.897 --> 26:31.842
Observer. And so my big question is, where is the 
next planetary mission coming from? Will it be the

26:37.267 --> 26:41.050
Discovery series? a larger mission, whatever.

26:45.838 --> 26:52.225
In the last 30 years since NASI got into business, 
the taxpayers have spent a lot of money on

26:45.838 --> 26:52.225
planetary astronomy. What do you think they've 
gotten back from it? I think they've gotten a lot of

26:55.149 --> 26:58.353
excitement. I frankly think that that money, 
generally speaking, has been well spent and that

26:58.433 --> 27:09.906
enough has come of it that is straightforward, and 
reasonably simple to understand. You don't need

27:13.541 --> 27:26.336
to be a professional astronomer to look at an image 
of a planet at a new resolution or a new wavelength

27:13.541 --> 27:26.336
and see there's brand new stuff going on there. I 
find that, again, when I talk to people in a public

27:26.356 --> 27:38.290
type, you know, the Kiwanis Club, ARP is one of my, 
they're desperate always for programs where I

27:26.356 --> 27:38.290
live, so they keep calling me up. that people 
appreciate what is being done. I don't think that

27:41.621 --> 27:50.278
when people hear that the NASA budget is 1% of the 
federal budget that they consider that ill spin at

27:41.621 --> 27:50.278
all. Most people think it's 10% or 15%, 
incidentally, which is not true. But again,

27:57.532 --> 28:00.598
perception is the problem here. Let's get a 
particular case now. The University of Colorado

28:03.506 --> 28:08.934
doesn't have any conservatory or anything. 
Again, I'm asking questions. You know I know some

28:10.877 --> 28:12.620
of the answers to them. But how did space science 
and planetary astronomy get going at Colorado?

28:17.267 --> 28:29.826
Space science had a really long tradition 
starting right after World War II with what was

28:17.267 --> 28:29.826
then the physics department and people like Bill 
Rents doing spectroscopy of first the sun and

28:30.700 --> 28:37.190
other solar system objects from rockets. And this 
has gone on through the years. And I think one of the

28:41.676 --> 28:47.725
other important things was Charlie Barth coming 
to the University of Colorado. It has then been

28:47.906 --> 28:56.098
formulated as a goal of the university to be one of 
the preeminent centers of space research in the

28:47.906 --> 28:56.098
country. So I think it started right after World 
War II. with rockets, mostly launched from white

29:00.518 --> 29:03.282
sands. And then it has developed into the more 
ambitious programs, the missions to planets. And

29:10.393 --> 29:20.427
one of the major OSO 8

29:10.393 --> 29:20.427
experiments was the University of Colorado.

29:23.312 --> 29:24.754
So I think that pretty much does it. Now, of course, 
we're a major Of course, in the industry, we have a

29:26.945 --> 29:31.051
major new building where we build the 
instruments. And one of our new instruments is one

29:32.573 --> 29:38.122
Larry Esposito is building for Cassini. Mission 
to Saturn, studying rings and everything else. So

29:43.570 --> 29:47.776
he's standing pretty good with the 
administration. Not sure what that means. We win

29:49.018 --> 29:53.104
our share of the competitions, which is the way all 
these things are selected, and we have areas of

29:54.198 --> 30:04.107
world-recognized expertise, detectors, 
systems, et cetera. Just out of curiosity, what

30:06.048 --> 30:13.735
percentage of undergrad students are actually 
getting the exposure to astronomy? I can't, well,

30:13.755 --> 30:16.878
first you have to define that. There is an 
undergraduate, you know, astronomy one type

30:16.898 --> 30:22.483
course, and that has hundreds of people So there's 
some fraction that way. For a long time, there was a

30:27.041 --> 30:42.017
satellite called SME, the Solar Mesospheric 
Explorer, where undergraduates could actually

30:27.041 --> 30:42.017
go in and learn how to operate a spacecraft. And for 
a long time, we were the only university that was

30:42.677 --> 30:48.464
operating their own spacecraft. And we did it with 
the proper supervision, but literally with

30:48.664 --> 30:53.449
undergraduate students And the University of 
Colorado has also had a fair number of people go on

30:53.986 --> 31:02.994
into the Astronaut Corps. Alan Shepard and there 
are others. I don't want to start down the list,

31:09.439 --> 31:12.422
because I'll surely forget one. But there's a 
bunch. People are still churning out grad

31:15.084 --> 31:20.929
students in space sciences and planetary 
astronomy and regular astronomy. When is that

31:20.949 --> 31:23.031
going to stop? Well, all economic systems are 
self-correcting. I try to be fairly candid with my

31:27.249 --> 31:37.383
students about what their job chances are, and 
they're not, I tell them, they're not what they

31:27.249 --> 31:37.383
used to be. Some of these people have almost built 
in things, like one of my very best graduate

31:39.405 --> 31:45.894
students is from Korea. He wants to go back to 
Korea. He'll get a job in Korea because he has a

31:47.776 --> 31:52.242
prestigious education and all that kind of thing. 
But as long ago, this was probably 20 years ago when

31:52.897 --> 32:00.646
I was doing some teaching at the University of 
Maryland. While I was at Goddard, I had an adjoint

32:00.666 --> 32:05.011
professorship at Maryland. And Gart Westerhout 
used to give the incoming students a little sheet

32:05.812 --> 32:12.140
of paper that said, OK, here you are. We'll be happy 
to educate you, but you really ought to know that

32:12.160 --> 32:18.988
you might not get a job being this studying 
cosmology at Mount Wilson and Palomar

32:19.340 --> 32:29.753
Observatories, you might wind up teaching in a 
small college or working for IBM or CSC or

32:19.340 --> 32:29.753
something like that. I think a lot of people are 
being honest about it. A lot of students, students

32:32.516 --> 32:44.491
that come into graduate school or at an age that are 
not always amenable to that kind of advice, to put

32:32.516 --> 32:44.491
it mildly, and you can't do anything about that. 
But I believe if you're honest up front, you're

32:45.432 --> 32:48.756
okay. Do you think planetary astronomy is kind of 
mined out as regards big discoveries? Nonsense.

32:57.659 --> 33:00.503
Professor Ari was not correct 100 years ago. No, it 
was not. Because that's something that several

33:02.566 --> 33:11.941
people have mentioned is, well, you know, we now 
know what the backside of the moon looks like.

33:11.961 --> 33:14.004
But there's no evidence of it. I think that's a very 
basic lack of understanding of what intellectual

33:16.951 --> 33:44.562
inquiry and knowledge are all about the day we 
quote know everything

33:16.951 --> 33:44.562
between the super colliding superconductor and 
the space station it's easy which one do you want

33:16.951 --> 33:44.562
pick the super colliding superconductor ask him 
and tell us something that we would actually like

33:16.951 --> 33:44.562
to know rather than have wpa for the command 
program or the people's program um What happened

33:46.702 --> 33:49.806
in planetary astronomy? Well, missions got more 
and more complex and more and more expensive, and I

33:51.068 --> 33:58.036
guess Viking was the ultimate one. And then what 
happened? Did the money just dry up, or did people

34:00.079 --> 34:04.765
say, wait a minute, the next mission's going to 
cost the gross natural product? Or what actually

34:04.825 --> 34:08.590
happened? Hard to say in detail, but due to human 
nature, Everything tends to escalate in expense

34:13.904 --> 34:17.548
and complexity. You know, Toyotas and Nissans or 
Datsuns, as they were then called 10 years ago,

34:18.849 --> 34:28.139
were at the low end of the curve, and they kept 
creeping up and creeping up. And the same human

34:28.159 --> 34:34.265
tendency works in missions. And if a $300 or $400 
million mission was great, well, how about a $2

34:40.499 --> 34:43.382
billion, that one ought to be really fantastic. 
And of course, you reach some kind of law of

34:43.402 --> 34:54.373
diminishing returns where the increment in 
knowledge is not necessarily proportional to the

34:43.402 --> 34:54.373
increment in cost, to put it as delicately as 
possible. So that, coupled with the fact that I am

34:55.334 --> 35:10.489
virtually sure that people in the NASA hierarchy 
are rewarded by the size of their missions or the

34:55.334 --> 35:10.489
amount of the budget that they control, You have a 
built-in escalation mechanism. And I think we see

35:15.304 --> 35:17.446
that in everything that we do. And partly, it's a 
technological advance. We know how to do things

35:20.370 --> 35:21.752
better. We don't want to do it the same way we did it 
15 or 20 years ago. And partially, it's the

35:25.656 --> 35:33.906
tendency towards complexity and bureaucracy and 
all the other little nummies that we have come to

35:25.656 --> 35:33.906
love and know. Now let's go back to the late 
unpleasantness at the Yerkes Observatory. Now,

35:39.713 --> 35:48.122
you may have been safely out of there, but I recall I 
spent a summer up there, and people like you and

35:39.713 --> 35:48.122
Ernie Heiser were telling people, don't come here 
to grad school. I mean, we're stuck here. We've got

35:49.343 --> 35:50.204
to finish it out. And that place was, as far as I 
know, famous for its infighting and everything.

35:56.711 --> 36:00.255
And eventually it got Quaker canned, so I 
understand. Is that true, do you know? It's true to

36:01.857 --> 36:07.763
the best of my knowledge that there was a revolt and 
a no-confidence vote and all that kind of thing. As

36:08.452 --> 36:12.938
a student there, I don't remember it quite as bad. I 
mean, we knew the fighting was going on, but it

36:12.958 --> 36:20.327
didn't actually affect us all that much in 
retrospect. And I'm perfectly happy with the

36:20.347 --> 36:24.092
education that I got there. But there's no 
question it was, it could get a little hairy. Was

36:31.701 --> 36:35.406
Kuiper, you left before Kuiper was ousted? No, no, 
Kuiper left. between my third and fourth years

36:40.025 --> 36:42.088
there. Which would be? 1959.

36:46.354 --> 36:51.300
And that's when LPL was founded in Tucson. But when 
I left, Morgan was acting director, which was a fun

36:51.901 --> 36:58.330
thing in and of itself. But corporate had already 
gone. Actually, only a few people survived that

37:04.173 --> 37:10.263
three- or four-year period in there. Well, 
remember that when I first went there, Bengt

37:10.283 --> 37:13.829
Ströngren was director. And I don't know what 
happened to him. I don't know whether he was pushed

37:17.054 --> 37:18.457
or shoved. It doesn't matter. He said, fine, I'm 
going back to my professorship as Carlsberg

37:19.138 --> 37:30.096
professor at the observatory in Denmark, which I 
now cannot remember the name of. It's a famous

37:31.257 --> 37:32.279
observatory. Yeah, it's in Copenhagen. Yeah, if 
any of us says the name, we'll know what it is. And I

37:36.385 --> 37:47.943
was told, don't have actual proof, but repeatedly 
told that the Carlsberg brewery put major funding

37:36.385 --> 37:47.943
into there, which, hey, we can handle that. And 
then Kuiper was director for a year or two. I don't

37:50.507 --> 37:53.672
know if it was one or two. I don't know. I don't 
remember. whether Strump was one or two years in.

37:59.484 --> 38:01.806
Morgan was, I think, acting director the last 
year. I've heard from a number of people that there

38:02.447 --> 38:08.273
were a lot of people saying things like studying 
the solar system is a waste of time. You know, we

38:08.613 --> 38:10.495
should be doing real astronomy. Well, there were a 
lot. In fairness, not only did Joe Chamberlain do

38:13.238 --> 38:18.083
solar system work, but so did Kuiper. And Kuiper 
was a hell of a smart man. People tend to forget that

38:23.148 --> 38:26.391
because his personality was a little rough. But he 
was very innovative. His studies of what we now

38:32.698 --> 38:41.489
call the Kuiper-Duncan belt were 30, 35 years, 40 
years ahead of their time, whatever the number is.

38:42.470 --> 38:49.880
And I think it's a tendency to underestimate his 
abilities and contributions, which I think is

38:42.470 --> 38:49.880
wrong. Do you remember when Aidan Minell left? 
That was... We had zero overlap at Yerkes, so I

38:54.535 --> 38:59.141
don't know when that was. And Joe Chamberlain? Joe 
Chamberlain was still at Yerkes when I left, and

39:00.283 --> 39:16.003
two years later, two and a half years later, he took 
the job as director, associate director of the

39:00.283 --> 39:16.003
space division, Kitt Peak, and I joined him at Kitt 
Peak for three years.
