WEBVTT

00:01.955 --> 00:09.906
of Mike Coker, C-O-K-E-R, the current planning 
director for the city of Dallas. And I'd like to

00:10.828 --> 00:27.051
start out, Mike, with asking you a bit about your 
background and how you came to be in the position

00:10.828 --> 00:27.051
you now enjoy.

00:28.060 --> 00:33.514
spent four years in the Army in the late 60s and 
early 70s. And upon getting out of the military,

00:33.534 --> 00:45.124
moved to Colorado, where I got my undergraduate 
degree in law enforcement administration and my

00:33.534 --> 00:45.124
master's degree in public administration. I 
spent about eight years in law enforcement in

00:45.104 --> 00:49.569
Colorado. In 1979, I got my first non-police 
administrative job as an assistant director of

00:49.989 --> 01:02.302
planning in the city of Lakewood, Colorado. 
Essentially, my function was over code

01:04.184 --> 01:09.009
enforcement and building inspection and plan 
review. It included zoning, interpretation and

01:11.311 --> 01:20.044
enforcement as well as all of the environmental 
ordinances of the city and plan review and

01:11.311 --> 01:20.044
building inspection enforcement. I did that for 
about a year and a half and moved to the city of

01:20.064 --> 01:30.400
Lubbock, Texas where I spent three years as the 
building official but also Assistant Director of

01:30.903 --> 01:41.706
the Planning Department there, and Jim Bergman, 
who you may know, who has very, very well brought up

01:30.903 --> 01:41.706
the planning in West Texas. After three years 
there, the city of Dallas contacted me, and they

01:42.614 --> 01:51.247
were having some difficulty with the building 
inspection division. At that time, it was a

01:51.547 --> 01:54.352
section of planning. Building inspection was a 
large division of the planning department. And

02:01.242 --> 02:02.504
you had mentioned Jack Shute. And Jack was the one 
who got the building inspection division as part

02:02.704 --> 02:08.653
of the planning department. But he came to the city 
of Dallas. because of some internal

02:11.858 --> 02:19.422
reorganization back during the Shoup era and just 
post-Shoup. and Cree Wilson era. They decided

02:24.017 --> 02:39.462
that they wanted the building inspection 
function, even though it still is responsible for

02:24.017 --> 02:39.462
zoning enforcement, to be placed under the public 
works department because of the

02:24.017 --> 02:39.462
interrelationship and the construction related 
activities, not the zoning part. That was

02:39.522 --> 02:41.425
ancillary, so they took it over there. I came to 
work for the city of Dallas then in January of 84.

02:48.275 --> 03:01.055
and worked in public works for about a year and a 
half, at which time the city manager here asked me

02:48.275 --> 03:01.055
to come to the planning department over the 
development services side as an assistant

02:48.275 --> 03:01.055
director. Development services here has three 
major functions, zoning, applications for

03:01.596 --> 03:09.388
changes, subdivision application, zoning board 
of adjustment, three major activities, as well as

03:09.875 --> 03:19.511
the responsibility for all of the city's base maps 
in both subdivisions and zoning. And they had some

03:20.353 --> 03:24.620
mechanical problems and some timing problems 
that they needed help with. So I came down and I did

03:25.562 --> 03:27.365
that for about a year. And then I got a promotion to 
director of budget and research last year. And I

03:35.525 --> 03:42.502
did that through the last tenuous budget cycle. 
And on October 1st, I was promoted then to Director

03:42.522 --> 03:52.386
of Planning and Development for the City of 
Dallas, primarily because I understand the

03:53.463 --> 04:17.192
relationships that exist within this corporate 
structure of the city of Dallas, and I have a large

03:53.463 --> 04:17.192
number of contacts in the public environment that 
extend beyond our corporate boundaries, that

03:53.463 --> 04:17.192
physical city hall environment, and rather than 
going outside of the city to look for a director,

04:17.594 --> 04:33.628
they felt like I had the background and the ability 
to help implement some management and some

04:17.594 --> 04:33.628
council policies that the city has been actively 
pursuing for a number of years.

04:37.304 --> 05:06.923
among those policies and processes that the city 
has been dealing with for the last number of years

04:37.304 --> 05:06.923
are the planning policies implementation 
program which was adopted by the city council in

04:37.304 --> 05:06.923
1984 the implementation of then two new programs 
that derived from the planning policies and one of

04:37.304 --> 05:06.923
those is the growth policy plan if you will with me 
read comprehensive plan growth policy plan

04:37.304 --> 05:06.923
comprehensive plan well it's not as broad brushed 
as a comprehensive plan in the technical sense

05:06.903 --> 05:28.793
it's going to be as close as the city of Dallas ever 
has been to a comprehensive plan assuming that the

05:06.903 --> 05:28.793
council adopts my assumption is that they will 
because they said that they wanted at this time the

05:06.903 --> 05:28.793
second part of that was to develop a a new, less 
cumulative set of zoning districts in order for

05:29.043 --> 05:37.922
the public to know what was allowed within very 
limited framework on parcels of land in the city of

05:38.662 --> 05:44.412
Dallas. I understand that it's quite a departure 
from the old ordinance. Absolutely. It's

05:48.959 --> 06:02.222
completely different and it's broader in that we 
have a lot of new districts that we didn't have

05:48.959 --> 06:02.222
before, but each of the districts is much more 
narrowly defined than before, and the cumulative

05:48.959 --> 06:02.222
zoning districts And once you got to an HC 
district, you could have everything that

06:02.202 --> 06:07.479
preceded it. But under this current program, if 
you have something that is

06:16.394 --> 06:22.709
Let's see, regional retail, which might be the 
equivalent of the old shopping center or

06:16.394 --> 06:22.709
something. I mean, you know what you can have 
there, and it's not everything that preceded it.

06:25.836 --> 06:27.861
There are finite limits to what you've got. But 
that's just an adjunct to what we're talking

06:27.921 --> 06:31.629
about. Those two things... are policies and 
ordinances that the City Council needs to adopt.

06:39.343 --> 06:59.935
As a result of that, we've come into an area that's 
known as transition, the transition policy that

06:39.343 --> 06:59.935
helps us get from the existing zoning ordinance, 
which has been on the map for 27 years, and the new

06:39.343 --> 06:59.935
ordinance, which will take effect ostensibly on 
July 19, 1989. And the transition is how we get from

06:59.915 --> 07:05.745
here, where we are today, to there in an orderly 
fashion. That could be quite awkward. It's going

07:07.989 --> 07:15.602
to be a very

07:07.989 --> 07:15.602
unique test of our ability to communicate with the 
public. Do you think that there will be many suits

07:16.263 --> 07:20.050
involved? I don't know. I think a lot of it depends 
upon how well we do communicate with our

07:24.243 --> 07:28.711
constituency. If you look at it in a broader 
perspective, most of the residential,

07:29.893 --> 07:38.769
especially single-family, duplex, 
multi-family, they are direct transition. They

07:38.789 --> 07:41.093
go from what they are today to what they will be next 
time, and all we're doing is adding an A behind the

07:41.258 --> 07:46.905
designation. I mean, they're exactly the same. So 
that takes about 85% of the city, so that leaves

07:48.347 --> 07:55.436
15%. That 15% is comprised of about 30,000 
property owners, and that's all the

07:55.937 --> 08:04.988
non-residential property in the city. But that 
30,000 properties, there's probably 18,000

08:04.968 --> 08:10.837
owners. Of the 18,000 owners, my suspicion is that 
both of those are not going to have too much to say

08:11.798 --> 08:25.018
about it because if they've got construction out 
there, then it becomes conforming by and large

08:11.798 --> 08:25.018
unless it's in a box of shoes or something. which 
we've got it down to maybe 5,000 people who may not

08:24.998 --> 08:31.586
be happy with what we're proposing. We'll work 
with those people on an individual basis to try and

08:31.626 --> 08:43.542
help them along, giving them a menu of things to 
choose from in some cases and recommending other

08:31.626 --> 08:43.542
things. So you'll get down to there's a certain 
percentage that we're probably going to have to

08:44.042 --> 08:53.875
spend a lot of time with, and they may be the ones 
that sue us. How long has the ordinance been in

08:54.040 --> 08:58.387
preparation? Well, if you go back, if you use the 
planning policies as phase one, we worked for

08:58.407 --> 09:13.770
about three years on the preparation of the 
planning policies, but really got into it in the

08:58.407 --> 09:13.770
post-shoot era. Have any neighborhood groups or 
special interest groups been participating in

09:13.852 --> 09:20.648
the reformulation of the organization? Oh, 
absolutely. Absolutely. The program has been

09:22.592 --> 09:29.869
broad-based throughout the city of Dallas. 254 
organized neighborhood groups that we interact

09:29.849 --> 09:42.309
with on a regular basis, and each of those have 
strong vocal memberships. The key player,

09:43.250 --> 09:53.967
however, for the residential side has been the 
Dallas Homeowners League, and they're an

09:43.250 --> 09:53.967
umbrella organization that take in 171 of the 254 
neighborhood organizations we have a couple of

09:53.947 --> 10:03.923
other significant property homeowner property 
associations that are umbrella in nature and

09:53.947 --> 10:03.923
citizens for for planning, and there's two or 
three other acronyms that I can't remember. But

10:08.753 --> 10:12.157
they all had an active role in this process. And the 
process has been going on, frankly, since 1984

10:12.197 --> 10:17.904
when we adopted the planning policies. OK. How do 
you manage this? How is it structured in terms of

10:21.087 --> 10:33.842
achieving good relationship between the 
planning agency staff and the neighboring groups

10:21.087 --> 10:33.842
or the special interest groups?

10:36.995 --> 10:51.915
A couple of years ago, Dennis Wilson, who was the 
director of the planning department for three

10:36.995 --> 10:51.915
years, just preceding me,

10:36.995 --> 10:51.915
was authorized to increase his staff by three 
members. One of the members is Ray Stanton, who

10:52.317 --> 10:59.305
used to be an assistant director of the planning 
department over the comprehensive planning

10:52.317 --> 10:59.305
division. But he is now an assistant director over 
the planning policies implementation team. So

11:07.135 --> 11:19.590
the planning policies implementation team, 
which has this, it's actually four people now, who

11:07.135 --> 11:19.590
are the focus of our interactive approach, along 
with support from each of the other divisions. I

11:19.570 --> 11:29.346
mean, he can take resources that he needs on a 
temporary basis to support him, like graphics

11:19.570 --> 11:29.346
support, comprehensive planning support, 
special studies. These people all have other

11:29.827 --> 11:35.596
full-time jobs as well as being support to this 
planning policies implementation team. But the

11:35.616 --> 11:45.392
strategy was to have this planning policies 
implementation team be the locus of our

11:35.616 --> 11:45.392
interactive effort with the community. I'm not 
trying to say that it was interacting with DHL or

11:46.013 --> 11:59.077
interacting with NAIOP, the National 
Association of Industrial and Office Parks. They

11:59.097 --> 12:02.503
were very strong players, but they played with 
this policy group, planning policies group. And

12:07.614 --> 12:14.747
that's been a very difficult marriage over the 
last two or three years. And we've gotten down,

12:15.368 --> 12:20.998
since August, we've developed a transition 
policy since August. And members from this

12:20.978 --> 12:39.173
diverse group of citizens sat on this committee, 
which was chaired by one of our city council

12:20.978 --> 12:39.173
members, and they hammered out this transition 
policy, which was adopted in January with final

12:20.978 --> 12:39.173
refinement. scheduled for June 30th. The 
council? Yes. And so, I mean, it's been a

12:43.140 --> 12:46.987
multi-phase mechanism, and it hasn't been 
smooth. I mean, it's been a painful, painful

12:47.528 --> 12:49.532
process. Jim Reed, if you haven't talked to Jim, 
you probably need to talk to Jim. He's the

12:53.699 --> 13:00.992
assistant city manager, and he has four 
departments that have a lot of

12:53.699 --> 13:00.992
development-related activities. But he said as 
recently as yesterday when we were briefing the

13:00.972 --> 13:29.460
plan commission on our Dallas area rapid transit 
program and our transition program that if

13:00.972 --> 13:29.460
anybody ever hires him again to

13:00.972 --> 13:29.460
rezone their city, he's going to tell them no 
because it's a very painful, excruciatingly

13:00.972 --> 13:29.460
painful process that forces you as an individual 
and a group to muster all of your political skills,

13:30.622 --> 13:44.426
your negotiation skills, your ability to field a 
lot of abuse, and to do it for a continued period of

13:30.622 --> 13:44.426
time. And we had all of that here. And what we seem to 
have now is pretty close to a rocky consensus. Now,

13:54.213 --> 13:58.217
the zoning ordinance has been adopted. The city 
council adopted the new zoning ordinance last

13:58.937 --> 14:02.541
month as well. And we're refining it, but I mean, 
it's the law. And anybody who comes in and applies

14:05.463 --> 14:13.511
after Sunday for a zoning change applies for a new 
zoning district and a new zoning ordinance. This

14:13.871 --> 14:15.693
is part of the transition strategy. I see. You 
mentioned something about 1989. That's the date

14:18.915 --> 14:22.819
that it becomes effective for the entire city. So 
as we go through the transition policy and the

14:23.170 --> 14:34.490
transition program, we're going to try and get 
voluntary conversion into this new zoning

14:23.170 --> 14:34.490
ordinance. But if we haven't done that, if we've 
got people who've held out, if we've got people who

14:35.231 --> 14:45.870
have sued us, I mean, whatever reason, we haven't 
gotten them to agree that this new zoning is

14:35.231 --> 14:45.870
proper. then on that date certain, all the zoning 
in the city of Dallas changes. And that's the point

14:50.021 --> 14:53.310
in time, I think, if we're going to be sued. And I 
have no reason to suspect that we will not We'll

14:56.684 --> 14:57.665
find out. But I don't expect it, Bob, to be a 
groundswell of suits. But I do expect to be suits on

15:03.853 --> 15:05.255
it. And maybe some class action stuff. I'd be 
surprised, just in general, if any city in this

15:07.298 --> 15:12.765
position went on suit. I agree. It's almost to be 
expected. But I want to ask you. It's been a

15:17.250 --> 15:18.332
five-year process. I mean, that's the point. It's 
been a five-year process. And that's what we

15:20.675 --> 15:24.700
thought it would take once we adopted the planning 
policies. Well, if you work with special interest

15:24.680 --> 15:41.929
groups and so forth, you probably have then 
fostered a great deal of understanding on the part

15:24.680 --> 15:41.929
of a great segment of the public that can support 
what has happened. Well, that's what I'm

15:42.190 --> 15:44.253
concerned about. I mean, we've dealt directly 
with a lot of people, but there are a million people

15:44.273 --> 15:50.063
in this city. And not all the people that we've 
dealt with even live in the city. I mean, there are

15:53.147 --> 15:54.649
property owners in the city. And my biggest 
concern is that we haven't done as effective a job

15:55.330 --> 16:05.562
of communication with the public as we are going to 
wish that we had done. Well, everyone can say that.

16:07.244 --> 16:07.545
Sure. And let me tell you about our transition 
program between now and June 30. Our city has eight

16:14.613 --> 16:18.241
council districts. So the city's broken up into 
eight council districts. And they're all elected

16:21.248 --> 16:23.052
from their district? Uh-huh. Are there any 
elected at large? Yes, we have three at large.

16:25.838 --> 16:26.279
Three at large. And one of those is the mayor. So we 
have 11 council members all together. We have

16:30.508 --> 16:34.056
proposed and the council has endorsed that we have 
two transition meetings in each council district

16:34.205 --> 16:40.042
between April 15th and June 1st. So that's 16 
meetings in six weeks. But we're really shooting

16:45.036 --> 16:48.366
for four weeks because we want some time to put the 
information together in a comprehensive form and

16:48.667 --> 16:56.657
give it to the city council before they have to vote 
on any changes. And they have set a date of June 30th

16:57.178 --> 17:05.388
to endorse wholly the transition program. We've 
done it in concept and never even say yea or nay on

17:05.408 --> 17:10.695
the 30th of June. What we intend to do is we are going 
to notify every property owner in the city of

17:10.715 --> 17:16.682
Dallas of the transition meetings. And we're also 
going to try and tell the property owner, if it's a

17:20.374 --> 17:31.931
direct transition, i.e., MF1 to MF1A, what that 
means to them. What's the consequence? That's

17:33.393 --> 17:34.074
right. There's no change. There's change in the 
letter. You can still do what you've been doing.

17:37.840 --> 17:41.185
You can have the same number of units, the same 
heights, that kind of stuff. And then for those

17:41.165 --> 17:42.807
30,000... This will have to be by mail? Yeah. In 
fact, we're going to vend it out. But we're going to

17:49.454 --> 17:51.877
validate the mailing so that we can... The mailing 
list and the validation process is our deal,

17:51.897 --> 17:55.861
because it's state law so-so. But we're going to 
have a vendor do it, and we figure it's going to cost

17:56.322 --> 18:00.807
us $200,000. At least it won't take staff time 
away. There might be more staff time. The city

18:05.414 --> 18:12.954
council on Wednesday said that we can have 
$350,000 to do that this year. We can't hire any

18:13.034 --> 18:17.907
staff, but there are staff that we'll hire, but 
they won't belong to us. They'll be consultant or

18:17.927 --> 18:20.554
vendor people. They won't be regular civil 
service. Which is fine with me because I don't want

18:24.458 --> 18:28.823
to expand my staff. I'd like to expand my staff, but 
not for this process because this is a temporary

18:28.863 --> 18:33.128
thing. It's busy work. That's right. And so we're 
going to bend that out. Then, remembering that the

18:39.154 --> 18:43.639
new ordinance was adopted and effective March 
1st, which is Sunday, any application for zoning,

18:44.260 --> 18:52.854
for rezoning in the city of Dallas will be against 
that standard. That's the first phase. The

18:53.696 --> 19:01.669
transition thing, anybody that volunteers to 
transition into the new zoning district, that'll

18:53.696 --> 19:01.669
be done in a subpoenaing change. And we think that 
we're probably going to handle 90% of the city that

19:02.310 --> 19:06.437
way. Let me ask you this question. How do you feel 
about zoning in general? What is the basis for your

19:13.932 --> 19:15.374
zoning? Let me ask you that first. You need to be 
clear on the question. I'm not sure I understand.

19:20.599 --> 19:23.342
What is the value basis for your zoning ordinance? 
On what foundation does your zoning rest? Health,

19:27.967 --> 19:29.348
safety, and welfare. It's not a common basis. How 
do you make, how are those determinations made?

19:35.670 --> 19:36.811
What I'm trying to get at is... Compatibility. I 
mean, we're talking about compatibility abuses.

19:40.135 --> 19:41.577
I don't know if I'm getting where you want to go. 
Well, I probably should ask a more direct

19:41.757 --> 19:44.941
question. You don't have an adopt-accompanism 
plan. No. To base it on. And under the

19:50.709 --> 19:55.094
state-enabling legislation, they mentioned 
something about this. Sure they did. How do you

19:56.796 --> 19:58.378
feel about that? I think I need to answer your 
question a couple of ways. One way is that our city

20:02.446 --> 20:18.724
attorney, since 1965, has interpreted our zoning 
map, which is comprised of 155 1-400 scale maps, as

20:02.446 --> 20:18.724
the plan for the city of Dallas. Wrong. I'm just 
telling you what our understanding is. Your

20:23.790 --> 20:26.813
previous attorney would not have done that. 
Irrespective. Irrespective. But to answer the

20:30.057 --> 20:37.798
question about a comprehensive plan for the city 
of Dallas, I think that it would have been a useful

20:30.057 --> 20:37.798
tool for a long, long time to help us in the growth 
management of our city. Not to control it, I'm not

20:44.070 --> 20:48.901
talking about control, I'm talking about 
management. And as we get closer to a growth policy

20:48.921 --> 20:57.120
plan that encompasses the best parts of 
comprehensive planning, My thought is that it

20:57.472 --> 21:04.558
will become the tool for the next two decades 
because it's a living document. If you just make a

21:04.578 --> 21:08.021
plan that dies, then it's no good. But if you have a 
plan that is a living document and it changes with

21:08.101 --> 21:17.229
the tide of our city, because cities are not 
static. Any city that is static is in serious

21:17.249 --> 21:19.411
trouble. The values change. Exactly, exactly. 
And I'm talking both political values and

21:23.374 --> 21:27.478
cultural values are tied together. traditional 
values. One of the things that's happening in

21:29.582 --> 21:37.559
Texas, and I suspect that you're really close to 
it, is that Texas is not the Texas that you knew 20

21:29.582 --> 21:37.559
years ago. I'm married to a Texan. I have been for 20 
years from Waco.

21:46.342 --> 21:49.806
And she tells me that Texas isn't Texas anymore. I 
said, what do you mean that Texas isn't Texas

21:49.826 --> 21:52.008
anymore? Well, Texas isn't for Texans. Be 
specific. Well, there's too many people from the

21:54.791 --> 21:56.713
Northwest. There's too many people from the 
Northeast. There's too many people from the

21:58.334 --> 21:59.976
Midwest. There's too many people from Florida and 
San Diego. I'm from San Diego. And I said, well,

22:04.841 --> 22:08.384
what difference does that make? And she says, 
well, they've brought all these different

22:08.404 --> 22:14.931
cultures, these values, these perceptions, and 
that's impacting, having a direct impact on

22:16.328 --> 22:19.435
Texas. Well, I still think that Texas is Texas. I 
just think Texas is getting better because when

22:22.984 --> 22:32.346
you have the diverse opportunities that are 
presented from different perspectives, you get a

22:32.495 --> 22:35.099
better environment to live in. But let me go back 
to... It's something that's enriching.

22:37.582 --> 22:38.163
Absolutely. The melting pot... I don't want to 
talk about illegal aliens or anything else

22:40.126 --> 22:45.734
because that's somebody else's deal. But I think 
that diverse cultures, diverse points of view

22:46.355 --> 22:57.952
help a city like the city of Dallas to become... 
We've talked about international. It allows us to

22:58.713 --> 23:01.557
become more of a... competitor in the 
international scheme of things and in the

23:01.537 --> 23:09.008
national scheme of things and on top of that in the 
state scheme of things. For example, I have a

23:10.030 --> 23:25.013
friend from Stockholm who visited Dallas 
specifically to see this building and the library

23:10.030 --> 23:25.013
and a few other buildings in town as outstanding 
examples of international scale architecture.

23:25.482 --> 23:29.849
And I think that Dallas has made a conscious effort 
in that direction. And we are continuing to do

23:29.869 --> 23:31.852
that, Bob. But to talk about the comprehensive 
planning perspective just a little bit longer, I

23:31.872 --> 23:46.475
think that the time has really come for us to have a 
document that we can use as the framework for the

23:31.872 --> 23:46.475
development of our city and the redevelopment. I 
mean, we've got to talk about both pieces of this

23:46.556 --> 23:49.380
puzzle. For two decades now, if you assume that the 
zoning ordinance that we've adopted that becomes

23:49.360 --> 24:07.691
effective for the entire city in July of 1989 will 
be the document subject to some changes that we're

23:49.360 --> 24:07.691
going to use for the next 20 years, because that's 
the last one lasted since 1965. That's 22 years.

24:10.522 --> 24:16.670
then we've got to have a plan to reinforce our 
zoning. And I don't think that you can have a

24:17.411 --> 24:19.733
quality... The question isn't the tail wagging 
the dog. Today is. But once we have a plan, then I

24:24.199 --> 24:29.626
think that the dog will once again be in the 
leadership position. Then the plan may have

24:29.646 --> 24:35.533
something in it that suggests that the ordinance 
would have to be modified. It will. See, one of the

24:37.318 --> 24:45.861
things that we are doing with the zoning ordinance 
that they just adopted is they also said that we

24:37.318 --> 24:45.861
know that there's going to be refinements to this. 
We know that there are going to be changes to this

24:48.097 --> 24:57.667
document and that's what the transition program 
should help us accomplish because they've given

24:48.097 --> 24:57.667
two and a half years to the transition. I mean it 
wasn't today it all changed and part this is a

24:57.747 --> 25:10.380
conscious decision on the part of the council to 
help us refine that ordinance so that when we get to

24:57.747 --> 25:10.380
1989 we've got the document the written document, 
I mean the growth policy plan, and it's supported

25:10.698 --> 25:17.386
by the zoning ordinance. Then they play together, 
and those two pieces of this puzzle together then

25:17.526 --> 25:25.756
become, in my interpretation, the comprehensive 
plan for the city of Dallas. And the tail and dog

25:26.337 --> 25:32.925
scenario is really true. If you make the 
assumption that the zoning that was placed on the

25:32.905 --> 25:55.673
map in 1965 was all correct, which I would venture 
to say was not correct, but if you made the

25:32.905 --> 25:55.673
assumption that it was correct, then why have we 
allowed so many changes in the zoning over the

25:32.905 --> 25:55.673
course of the 22 years? And I'm not saying that 
we're not going to have changes in zoning then

25:55.653 --> 26:05.664
either, because we're rezoning 276,000 pieces of 
property in the city of Dallas with this

25:55.653 --> 26:05.664
transition process. And when the smoke clears, 
there's going to be people out there that are not,

26:06.545 --> 26:16.076
even if they agree today, that they'll accept CS 
zoning instead of SC zoning. Five years hence,

26:17.358 --> 26:21.863
they may think that that needs to be a higher 
density.
