WEBVTT

00:02.022 --> 00:07.550
Okay.

00:09.933 --> 00:16.402
You were a captain in the Army Reserve up in 
Wisconsin then? No, I never was a First Lieutenant

00:16.422 --> 00:30.662
in the either the Reserves or the National Guard, 
but think nothing of that. standing operating

00:31.975 --> 00:40.568
procedure in both the Reserves and the National 
Guard. Well in Wisconsin, first you were in Texas

00:40.588 --> 00:57.233
you were in the Army Reserve and then you switched 
to the National Guard in New Mexico and now when you

00:40.588 --> 00:57.233
came to Wisconsin were you in the Army Reserve or 
were you in the National Guard of Wisconsin? I

00:57.253 --> 00:58.795
reverted to the Army Reserve. Okay, so you're in 
the Army Reserve, okay. and I pretty well ignored

01:02.418 --> 01:31.125
the Army Reserve, except

01:02.418 --> 01:31.125
in those days, and still I suppose, a reserve 
officer had to show some interest in his status as a

01:02.418 --> 01:31.125
reserve officer in order to have his commission 
extended beyond five years. Now, if he ignored the

01:35.871 --> 02:01.483
fact that he hadn't qualified himself for further 
extension, within the next five years he could do

01:35.871 --> 02:01.483
something that would manifest enough interest 
and participation to be commissioned for another

01:35.871 --> 02:01.483
five years and available for call. Well to make a 
long story short, while I was at, I left New Mexico

02:01.987 --> 02:18.251
for a job in

02:01.987 --> 02:18.251
Michigan College of Mines. Well that was a new job 
and I ignored the reserves

02:19.953 --> 02:31.690
for two years, the two years that I was there. I just 
didn't take any correspondence courses. I

02:35.715 --> 02:40.942
refused to go to any of their summer sessions, two 
weeks of summer tours. I waived it because I had

02:42.064 --> 02:50.015
enough credits from correspondence courses to 
get me over the tide. So by taking correspondence

02:50.897 --> 03:00.951
courses, I stayed in the Reserve Corps, stayed on 
the active duty list, eligible for call

03:01.505 --> 03:09.516
until I got involved in the National Guard. Now, I 
became acquainted with this lawyer White when I

03:10.838 --> 03:28.262
was finishing a course on a

03:10.838 --> 03:28.262
rather elementary course. All of those courses 
were elementary as hell. and in topographic

03:32.217 --> 03:47.351
reading of maps and the topographic use of maps, 
and they were in topographics. So, I took a

03:47.371 --> 03:59.423
correspondence course on it, got a passing grade 
on everything, so I ran into the captain and I says,

04:00.500 --> 04:04.365
I just finished the course and the correspondents 
said, you guys have to take it. I'll help you out on

04:06.628 --> 04:08.070
it. I've got there.

04:11.655 --> 04:17.463
I've got there, done the course, got my solutions, 
got their solutions, Brack. I says, if you want to

04:18.484 --> 04:26.575
use this as a training aid with your troops, why, 
you can have it. Well, he says, that's fine, I

04:27.331 --> 04:34.178
didn't know who you were, you must say the 
lieutenant in the guard in the reserves. I says,

04:34.959 --> 04:38.042
that's all I am and that's all I expect to be.

04:41.185 --> 04:49.494
Because I've got, I'm working on the side projects 
and teaching school, doing all I can. He says,

04:50.655 --> 04:52.697
well, he says, thanks. So, I didn't know it at the 
time, but he was trying to get rid of the job of

04:53.875 --> 05:18.547
captain to

04:53.875 --> 05:18.547
give more attention to his law practice and he was 
really doing, setting the world on fire as a lawyer

04:53.875 --> 05:18.547
and justly so. He was a brilliant man.

05:24.352 --> 05:37.928
So

05:24.352 --> 05:37.928
when he went up to the Adjutant General and told him 
that he wanted to get rid of the job, he said, well

05:24.352 --> 05:37.928
who's your first lieutenant?

05:40.551 --> 05:41.812
Well can he take over? Yeah, he can take over. So 
they gave the second, the first lieutenant, he was

05:44.716 --> 05:51.203
an optometrist. in town and a darn good man and a 
good soldier.

05:57.961 --> 06:07.331
He came up, took the physical examination and so 
forth, and he busted the physical. Now a lot of

06:08.793 --> 06:21.426
people think that you can do, get away with 
anything in the Guard because they do do things

06:08.793 --> 06:21.426
when it's necessary. that is sometimes not 
according to the rules. Alright, here was a guy

06:25.101 --> 06:33.231
that had busted the examination for captain. 
Well, where's the second lieutenant? Well, it

06:35.934 --> 06:44.925
just so happened that week the second lieutenant 
had been arrested for bootlegging.

06:44.945 --> 06:47.228
It was a mild operation. I don't know why they 
strained at such and that as that, but they

06:47.562 --> 06:57.655
strained at it and says, no, we got to get somebody 
else. So

06:58.936 --> 07:15.257
then the

06:58.936 --> 07:15.257
lawyer told him, said, well, there's one other guy 
in town that could take it over and make do an even

07:15.845 --> 07:19.209
better job than I have done. He says, bragging on 
me. He says he could take it, but he says he's busy as

07:21.211 --> 07:25.616
hell. He's working at the college and he's nursing

07:25.716 --> 07:35.447
a PhD project. Says he'll turn it down flat. Well he 
says, let me talk to him. He says, well you come up

07:41.153 --> 07:45.278
and talk to him.

07:45.983 --> 07:52.590
So the accident general came up and talked to me, 
and he was a very persuasive fella. Are you taking

07:52.610 --> 07:56.414
at the moment? Mm-hmm. Would you try to talk to us? 
He talked to you. Oh, not in the heat, but I just...

08:01.500 --> 08:05.344
Yeah, he was... I cut that air conditioning too far 
back in the night. So, see...

08:11.350 --> 08:12.312
He was a... This accident general was... little 
short of being a genius himself.

08:25.578 --> 08:29.284
Talk about a guy that could juggle and keep several 
balls in the air. He was one of them. In fact, he's

08:32.769 --> 08:43.986
the man that invented, thought up, and helped to 
create the CCC. Civilian. Yeah, a conservation

08:45.456 --> 08:49.499
clerk. He dreamed the whole thing up and organized 
it to put on in Wisconsin. And then the then

08:58.547 --> 09:07.175
governor was the younger brother of the senator 
from Wisconsin. So he showed the structure and the

09:07.195 --> 09:14.361
plan and everything to Senator La Follette. And 
then they got ahold of the cabinet, and I think

09:15.708 --> 09:30.869
about three of the cabinet members modestly 
claimed credit for putting the whole thing,

09:15.708 --> 09:30.869
dreaming it up and putting it on the road. Not to 
mention the congressmen that put up the money. So

09:36.858 --> 09:45.630
the CCC was a product of Ralph Emmel. I double 
M-E-L-L. He was a Scandinavian son of a

09:50.181 --> 09:59.589
Scandinavian family down close to La Crosse. And 
he must have convinced you then to become the

10:00.450 --> 10:03.633
captain. Well, he himself had been promoted 
through the ranks.

10:12.281 --> 10:15.043
He came back from Europe where he had been a first 
lieutenant or captain in the Yankee Division. He

10:21.323 --> 10:39.239
had gotten separated from the, well he went in 
there from college, Corps of Cadets at Madison and

10:21.323 --> 10:39.239
went to Officer Candidate School. He came out of 
the Corps of Captains and At a very young age he was

10:45.449 --> 10:58.668
picked for adjutant general by a very fine and 
sensible governor that we had back in that era. And

10:58.688 --> 11:03.915
the job was his until he was 64 years old. That was 
written into the law. They didn't believe that

11:08.462 --> 11:14.190
every governor that came along should have a right 
to name is Adjutant General. So they just took care

11:17.725 --> 11:25.878
of it by saying this is a job that a man holds to a 
certain age. That's the retiring age of the

11:26.018 --> 11:28.862
regular army at that time. And so he inherited the 
job and I think he had gone through the grades

11:30.945 --> 11:42.102
rather rapidly and at that time was a Brigadier 
General. and that's the general of the state. And

11:46.566 --> 11:54.994
he was a fellow that knew how to break rules

11:46.566 --> 11:54.994
logically and successfully. And he could do it. So 
he convinced you to become the captain? He talked

12:02.922 --> 12:05.784
me into it. And then did you go to summer camps 
during the 1930s in Wisconsin? Yeah, I went to the

12:10.549 --> 12:12.831
first summer camp after I was captain, and

12:13.182 --> 12:23.915
White helped me pick.

12:23.935 --> 12:41.957
White, by the way, in order to get from under the 
military load, White, when he vacated the job as

12:23.935 --> 12:41.957
captain,

12:23.935 --> 12:41.957
Emil talked him into accepting a staff job as first 
lieutenant back in the guard. He says, this way you

12:47.402 --> 12:53.187
won't have anything to do except be in camp. And he 
says, you don't even have to take correspondence

12:55.249 --> 12:58.472
courses. You just be in camp.

13:05.298 --> 13:12.805
We need people like you on the list when it comes to 
mobilization.

13:13.072 --> 13:24.762
quirk of fate, White became my lieutenant colonel 
and happily served and did a hell of a good job on

13:13.072 --> 13:24.762
mobilization. So things,

13:25.763 --> 13:42.977
the National Guard can break regulations with the 
regular army any damn time they want to if they, if

13:25.763 --> 13:42.977
it's a sensible thing to do and it works out. But if 
it doesn't work out, the guard will find it out

13:43.632 --> 13:50.320
before the regular army does. And it'll be 
corrected. When did you start mobilizing, in

13:52.402 --> 13:55.105
1940? That date, let you read there. October 15, 
1940. That's when I started my five year leave of

14:01.092 --> 14:09.201
absence. And all of the guards were mobilized at 
that time in Wisconsin or just select

14:11.105 --> 14:16.530
individuals? No, it's not practical.

14:24.137 --> 14:39.711
It's all the railroads, the railroads right today 
and the highway equipment couldn't stand the

14:24.137 --> 14:39.711
strain of mobilizing all the guard. as of a certain 
week, normally in the autumn, or whenever it had to

14:40.568 --> 14:50.102
be. But, so the War Department and the Guard and the 
regular Army had learned a lot in World War I.

15:08.716 --> 15:23.459
They learned that the old square division,

15:08.716 --> 15:23.459
which in World War I had 29,000 officers and men. 
Now, when we got automobiles, and the reason we got

15:25.543 --> 15:36.580
trucks to pull the cannon and trucks to carry the 
ammunition and became liberated of the horses.

15:42.796 --> 15:50.423
Now the regular army clung to the horses for at 
least 10 of their regiments of artillery. As late

15:52.304 --> 16:01.612
as 1942, I think we had a few horse regiments. Yes,

16:01.652 --> 16:06.837
the horse-drawn battalions were in the, all in, 
had simmered down to one division. That was the

16:16.371 --> 16:19.636
cavalry division that was still patrolling the 
border. A company, a troop or two near Del Rio

16:20.999 --> 16:29.432
there.

16:30.408 --> 16:33.553
Then the division headquarters in San Antonio. 
And then they had, I think the end of the other end of

16:34.835 --> 16:45.092
the line, they had usually a Negro regiment down in 
Brownsville.

16:45.112 --> 16:47.937
There was a cavalry out there. Then out the other 
way, they went to California. with detachments of

16:55.248 --> 16:57.891
horse cavalry here and there. That's the time of 
the Columbus raid, for example. So they couldn't

17:01.456 --> 17:02.837
take the strain. Yeah. And when they mobilized you 
and made you a colonel, what assignment did they

17:04.600 --> 17:10.347
give you? What were you in charge of? What was I in 
charge of? Well,

17:16.915 --> 17:24.124
the batteries of the 120th Field Artillery 
Regiment.

17:26.939 --> 17:29.686
were scattered in small towns.

17:33.395 --> 17:45.083
And so,

17:33.395 --> 17:45.083
when the time came for us to be mobilized, we 
converged at Camp McCoy. The way I know of that is in

17:45.282 --> 17:47.125
Wisconsin. Yeah, well that's the traditional 
training ground. It's now Fort McCoy, they call

17:51.833 --> 17:53.697
it. That merely gives it a more euphonious 
permanent status, I guess. Still the same McCoy.

18:06.900 --> 18:08.122
And did you start training there? No, we didn't 
start training there. Each battery came down with

18:12.029 --> 18:16.295
its own motorized equipment. Oh, I see. Now, the 
Guard has been entirely motorized, except the

18:17.336 --> 18:25.728
cavalry regiments of the Guard. And there was a 
cavalry division of horse cavalry. When, at the

18:36.283 --> 18:40.028
time of the big mobilization, But

18:41.594 --> 18:46.979
our mobilization was very simple.

18:51.264 --> 18:58.311
It was, men were notified, we received recruits if 
anybody wanted to go, and we had a vacancy. Well,

18:59.992 --> 19:07.740
that was a time where you, that was one time in 
recruiting where you could pick and choose.

19:07.760 --> 19:10.723
Because the minute that the word is out, guard in 
this small town was going out. By then, a lot of the

19:15.784 --> 19:24.175
young bucks that had been too lazy to participate 
in the guard say, well, if they're going to do

19:15.784 --> 19:24.175
something, it'd be interesting. Yeah, sure, I'd 
like to be in. So we, each unit in each town had a

19:27.240 --> 19:33.208
waiting list. Went off and left people that would 
have been listed if there had been a vacancy. So...

19:41.956 --> 19:49.143
We went in our own rolling equipment.

19:49.704 --> 20:07.761
And plus, a certain number of people could go with, 
usually officers are

19:49.704 --> 20:07.761
well-known

19:49.704 --> 20:07.761
non-commissioned officers, known to be highly 
reliable. Only those could have their own car, and

20:10.036 --> 20:19.806
their car couldn't go with the caravan. But they 
had to be where the caravan was to be at the end of the

20:20.887 --> 20:29.095
day's march. So we had individual batteries, went 
individually to Camp McCoy.

20:39.736 --> 20:48.728
The 1st Battalion was with modifications here and 
there for geographical reasons. The 1st

20:49.909 --> 21:01.524
Battalion moved out 24 hours ahead of the 2nd

20:49.909 --> 21:01.524
Battalion. And where the 1st Battalion stayed 
their first night, and let us say

21:10.499 --> 21:26.116
Well, let us say the Illinois National Guard 
Armory or Drill Grounds or something in

21:10.499 --> 21:26.116
Rockford. Rockford is right south of Beloit. Yes. 
Rockford, Illinois. Yeah, I think now they went as

21:31.822 --> 21:35.106
far as Rockford, Illinois. But we stayed all night 
at McCoy. The next day we lined up and drove, went as

21:40.216 --> 21:55.230
a military serial, motor serial, and it was a motor 
march from there to Rockford. We moved into the

21:56.091 --> 22:06.460
facilities that they used, stoves, sleeping 
space in the armory, all that stuff. We moved out of

22:07.881 --> 22:09.683
that nest and followed the other one, I think the 
next nest was somewhere down around Memphis, or

22:10.625 --> 22:23.438
Cairo, Illinois, somewhere down there. And the 
next one was in Vicksburg, and then from Vicksburg

22:24.639 --> 22:38.674
to the final rendezvous at supposed to be Camp 
Livingston. at Louisiana,

22:39.920 --> 22:50.794
that town north of Alexandria.

22:51.155 --> 22:59.666
They had a National Guard training field and 
encampment installation for the Louisiana

22:51.155 --> 22:59.666
National Guard. We moved into the 32nd Division, 
moved into that place, had to substitute until

23:08.827 --> 23:12.812
they got Camp Livingston built. Now the artillery 
brigade was billeted.

23:21.322 --> 23:30.152
The division overflowed the facilities actually 
at Camp Beauregard. So the artillery brigade with

23:30.172 --> 23:36.640
the 120th part of it, a third of it, had to go out to a 
kind of a hill rising from the marshes around it. I

23:48.954 --> 23:50.656
think they called it Blueberry Hill. And on its 
slopes and ridges, we went into what became known

23:52.559 --> 24:00.611
as Camp Disregard. We

24:00.991 --> 24:07.521
were in Camp Disregard. for four months while they 
were finishing Camp Livingston. And of course

24:14.772 --> 24:36.546
when Livingston was finished, as fast as they 
finished it, we moved over there and finally the

24:14.772 --> 24:36.546
entire brigade of the square division and the 
entire square division was billeted in Camp

24:14.772 --> 24:36.546
Livingston. and it was from Camp Livingston, that 
the 32nd Division was alerted for overseas

24:37.977 --> 24:48.931
movement. And now I know that I'm going to say 
something that somebody's going to dispute. But

24:56.902 --> 25:04.812
the first division to be alerted for an overseas 
movement after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, when

25:05.939 --> 25:23.760
it was a known fact that we were in up to our eyes, the 
first division alerted to go overseas was the 32nd

25:05.939 --> 25:23.760
Division. And the alert and the man who selected it 
was none other than Lieutenant

25:23.780 --> 25:33.972
General

25:39.908 --> 25:40.649
He's a German. As a matter of fact, his nickname in 
the Army was Herman the German, but he was really

25:42.072 --> 25:51.911
one of the most brilliant Army officers I've ever 
met.

25:58.504 --> 26:00.027
His name will come to me in a minute.

26:21.168 --> 26:22.250
Where was he assigned? He was commander of the 1st 
Army Area. And the 1st Army Area consisted of the

26:28.038 --> 26:37.652
consolidation of two corps areas.

26:45.803 --> 26:47.766
The general that I'm trying to think of is the 
general that MacArthur

26:49.282 --> 26:59.056
wired, demanded. He didn't,

27:00.038 --> 27:18.765
when MacArthur dealt with the chief of staff

27:00.038 --> 27:18.765
that day, he didn't ask him to do something, he 
didn't tell him what to do. He told him that he

27:19.454 --> 27:34.228
wanted

27:19.454 --> 27:34.228
the general that was out there replaced by this guy 
that was in the campaign of his name.

27:40.273 --> 27:41.855
Kroger. Yeah. His nickname, it made him mad when he 
heard it. And it's a nickname that he had that he

27:49.762 --> 28:00.553
didn't like, so I'm reluctant to write it into the 
record here. But his nickname was Herman the

28:01.914 --> 28:04.397
German. Now that had, he was, Kruger was really one 
of the outstanding generals of this war.

28:15.488 --> 28:17.009
Especially out in the Pacific here. Out in the 
Pacific. And

28:19.495 --> 28:25.062
he was over age. The chief of staffs, I

28:26.764 --> 28:45.267
have to stop and think of a lot of these old army 
names because they get mixed up.

28:48.588 --> 28:56.079
The chief of staff

28:48.588 --> 28:56.079
had written in his requirements. In fact, the 
chief of staff...

28:57.502 --> 29:14.347
George Marshall. Yeah, how in the hell can you 
forget that name? It's just when you want to use it.

29:25.719 --> 29:46.388
George Marshall created an age

29:25.719 --> 29:46.388
scale and he had decided that no general officer 
would go overseas in command of troops

29:48.207 --> 29:55.215
that was over 60 years of age. Because the 
colonel's list was literally cluttered up with

29:57.357 --> 30:05.366
old men just waiting to become 64. That was his 
logic. So there'd be no general in command of

30:10.852 --> 30:16.358
troops and I might go over there as an inspector or 
something like that. But to exercise a command, he

30:21.346 --> 30:28.917
had to be a major general in command of a division. 
He had to be at least

30:29.919 --> 30:36.688
under 61. Now,

30:36.869 --> 30:46.783
to the best of my knowledge,

30:36.869 --> 30:46.783
Krueger is the only man that did go overseas to a 
command assignment, battlefield assignments. I

30:59.630 --> 31:01.512
think he's the only one on the list. Now anybody can 
check it out if they want to by getting the officer

31:02.653 --> 31:11.164
list of that era and whatnot. Where did Kruger send 
you?

31:17.122 --> 31:19.064
Kruger didn't send me. I was detached from the 
division to take an assignment in the 5th Corps as

31:19.084 --> 31:30.776
commander of another regiment.

31:30.796 --> 31:36.642
So the fellow that transferred me out was a 
lieutenant general.

31:45.030 --> 31:46.892
See their faces. Daley.

31:55.397 --> 32:00.124
Daley was a lieutenant general and commanding the 
fifth corps. And the

32:02.467 --> 32:17.048
fifth corps at that time was a very, very big list of 
troops.

32:17.804 --> 32:21.628
The word corps is a rather flexible term. It is, 
consists of a corps headquarters,

32:23.069 --> 32:44.571
an artillery brigade, and

32:23.069 --> 32:44.571
two or three separate regiments, such as medical 
regiments and engineer regiments, and then

32:23.069 --> 32:44.571
sundry battalions, and finally you get down to a 
company of military police, which is probably the

32:44.973 --> 32:54.891
smallest command in the Corps.

32:57.335 --> 33:08.415
So, to get back to the basic question, the 32nd 
Division,

32:57.335 --> 33:08.415
the day after Pearl Harbor,

33:13.424 --> 33:41.642
Well, I think during the

33:13.424 --> 33:41.642
bombardment of Pearl Harbor,

33:13.424 --> 33:41.642
the San Antonio man, Herman the German,

33:13.424 --> 33:41.642
called

33:13.424 --> 33:41.642
Major General commanding the 32nd Division and 
the two brigadiers and also the similar ranks of

33:42.517 --> 33:52.089
the 37th Division.

33:53.731 --> 34:10.532
Now it was a square division like we were,

33:53.731 --> 34:10.532
but it was over in Alabama at Camp Shelby, and 
Shelby was in his Army area, so he had Those two,

34:11.761 --> 34:23.099
those six officers and I don't know from how many 
other divisions, if any, he may have called.

34:26.565 --> 34:38.764
But the Brigadier General of Infantry that was 
included in the call from the 32nd and our Major

34:26.565 --> 34:38.764
General that was in the same call,

34:40.212 --> 34:52.109
their stories jived as to what happened. They went 
down there and

34:52.129 --> 35:04.907
Krueger said, well gentlemen, now there were some 
other officers there, but they could have been

34:52.129 --> 35:04.907
staff officers. He had quite a little huddle. but I 
know those two divisions were there represented

35:08.647 --> 35:38.502
because I knew all six of them personally because 
later on I was right next door to this 37th division

35:08.647 --> 35:38.502
while I was over there as a regimental commander 
because I got one of the regiments that was in the

35:08.647 --> 35:38.502
field artillery brigade

35:40.152 --> 36:08.083
Now they came back and old Herman the German or 
Kruger says to them, I'm sorry to tell you

35:40.152 --> 36:08.083
gentlemen, but you and you and you and you and 
everybody except the major general commanding

35:40.152 --> 36:08.083
the 37th division who was a young state engineer of 
Ohio, he says, you fellows are out of age for

36:08.637 --> 36:14.984
overseas duty. And he says you will be retained in 
the service, you will be given assignments in the

36:15.005 --> 36:32.946
troop training program that is now looming ahead 
of us as something

36:15.005 --> 36:32.946
phenomenal. Says instead of two million men 
overseas, that we did in World War I, we've got to

36:37.662 --> 36:45.831
think in terms of millions on two fronts. For the 
first time in history, we're on the two front war.

36:52.519 --> 36:55.682
And he says, we'll need all of you. But for field 
service, he has this wage scale, this age scale.

37:04.713 --> 37:15.707
And we've been enforcing it, published it, and 
enforcing it on colonels, lieutenant colonels,

37:04.713 --> 37:15.707
majors, and captains. And he says, the chief of 
staff and their studies have set up this age scale,

37:17.950 --> 37:33.690
and you've been weeding out your overage 
captains, you've been weeding out your overage

37:33.873 --> 37:41.422
age majors and all of you have at least one or two 
colonels that are over 60. It says as a matter of

37:41.442 --> 38:03.407
fact the top age for a colonel is 58 and as you know 
the top age for a lieutenant colonel is I think it's

37:41.442 --> 38:03.407
52 yeah and the over age limit for a major is 48, and 
says now that age list in some of your divisions and

38:03.725 --> 38:20.870
regiments has not been clearly, uh, shaken out. 
Says these people are over age, are to be retained

38:20.890 --> 38:27.680
here as trainers. But says these, the bunch that 
are going out now, the first echelons overseas.

38:38.141 --> 38:40.043
This is the age scale. Well, you were well within 
that age for a colonel. So, that meant to you that

38:42.785 --> 38:45.347
you were going overseas. Sure. Incidentally, all 
the colonels of artillery went overseas in grade,

38:46.909 --> 39:03.364
in the 32nd Division, because we had already 
zealously, I had The age and grade problem had

39:04.323 --> 39:28.973
already been solved in the 120th Field Artillery 
when the bombardment came and the Soho crowd had

39:04.323 --> 39:28.973
been equally zealous in getting down to the 
nitty-gritty and complying with it. Now you say,

39:29.514 --> 39:30.996
well who made up that? Who says that a guy that's 42 
and just mediocre should be retained and a guy

39:32.690 --> 39:49.509
that's 47 that's twice as healthy and well and 
happy and a better field officer. Why should he be,

39:50.290 --> 39:59.220
well maybe he shouldn't go to be a good trainer, but 
why should he be Why should this more or less weak

39:59.453 --> 40:11.891
sister here be retained because he's 42 and got a 
chronic something wrong with him that impairs his

39:59.453 --> 40:11.891
efficiency? You have to keep this guy, but you have 
to lose that guy. I've never solved that and I don't

40:17.420 --> 40:26.473
believe it was soundly executed, but Did you go 
into the first campaign, into our North African

40:28.310 --> 40:33.155
campaign? You were in the European Theater. We 
were in the European Theater when

40:35.998 --> 40:54.958
the people that went out on this first pickup

40:35.998 --> 40:54.958
to get back to the meeting down there, he said that 
he was, they were sending over heavily reinforced

40:56.609 --> 41:07.863
corps, he told his generals, after he broke the 
news to it, who among them was going to stay in his

40:56.609 --> 41:07.863
assignment and who wasn't. He says the,

41:09.666 --> 41:25.806
you will go back to your units and triangularize 
them. Well, that's no big job. The entire

41:29.918 --> 41:33.942
triangular division comes out of one square 
division. In other words, you slough off, you're

41:34.963 --> 41:40.789
sloughing off units instead of men. So, he says 
you're to go back and triangularize yourself from

41:42.952 --> 41:53.042
a square division of about 23,000 men down to a 
triangular rise division of about 1,500 men,

41:54.052 --> 42:20.717
15,000 men, officers and men, and says having done 
that, and of course you'll picture a vest and keep

41:54.052 --> 42:20.717
all you can that you think ought to be going out in 
this advanced corps, this reinforced corps will

42:21.237 --> 42:49.523
move without delay, that's to mean as far as you 
can, as soon as you can get the stuff on the

42:21.237 --> 42:49.523
railroad, as soon as the railroads can haul you and 
all that, but you will proceed without delay to

42:21.237 --> 42:49.523
ports of embarkation in the area of Boston, and

42:21.237 --> 42:49.523
after you've slept off these surplus units, 
picked out the best you've got left over out of the

42:50.228 --> 42:55.435
part of that. And it'll also consist of at least 
four divisions. It'll be, its code name will be

43:04.968 --> 43:08.753
Force Magnet. So you can just forget the core name. 
It'll be Force Magnet. And Magnet will have in it at

43:20.688 --> 43:47.505
least three or four or maybe five divisions with 
appropriate number of non-divisional troops to

43:20.688 --> 43:47.505
make up a big corps or maybe two corps and the two 
corps would be you see an army is two or more corps So

43:48.869 --> 43:52.173
you debarked, or you left then for Boston? No, you 
don't, as he says, you don't move this all at once.

44:01.603 --> 44:17.560
First, you got to stuff off these other, the 
surplus regiments and battalions and companies,

44:01.603 --> 44:17.560
and you set them over here in one part of the 
reservation, and get this other new division,

44:18.873 --> 44:21.255
triangularized division. It takes 24 hours of 
staff discussion and whatnot to get the list. Then

44:31.564 --> 44:47.698
shifting them around on the camp area so that 
they'll begin working as a unit in their training

44:31.564 --> 44:47.698
and whatnot while they're getting, we knew it was 
Christmas time at the end So, this is Christmas 42?

44:49.183 --> 44:49.504
42. You can't get in a railroad haulage at that 
time. It's all tied up with commerce and passenger

44:55.510 --> 44:59.313
traffic. Well, when did you leave for Europe now?

45:03.818 --> 45:04.739
I didn't get out. This core artillery brigade was 
toward the bottom of the list. It was right after

45:10.905 --> 45:13.628
the last full division. So, and my regiment within 
that artillery brigade had an especially high

45:16.045 --> 45:28.545
priority rate so that it would be the first 
regiment to go out of the brigade. So I didn't, with

45:29.747 --> 45:33.193
all the...
