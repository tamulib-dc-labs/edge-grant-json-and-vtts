WEBVTT

00:03.068 --> 00:04.510
Mike test 1, 2, 3. Mike test 1, 2, 3. I'm in the 
process of conducting an interview with somebody

00:07.555 --> 00:13.004
dealing with the assassination of John F. 
Kennedy. My name is Eugene Sepulveda. Today is

00:14.426 --> 00:17.611
March the 12th, 1980. This is another volume test, 
just another volume. Okay, but were you in the rank

00:24.078 --> 00:29.453
of a detective or were you in the rank of a 
policeman? Eight years as a detective, two years

00:29.694 --> 00:34.527
as a lieutenant detective.

00:41.999 --> 00:44.962
Okay, just so could I have this again? If this is 
correct, if this is correct, please correct me.

00:48.987 --> 00:50.249
Name's John B. Evans. You're 33 and a half years of 
the policeman, eight years of the detective, and

00:51.130 --> 00:56.476
two years of the lieutenant detective. Is that 
correct? No. Okay. All in criminal investigation

01:00.180 --> 01:04.285
bureau, they call it. That's the department here. 
All right. Can you just kind of start off like we

01:07.729 --> 01:10.572
started talking yesterday? Yeah. Have you got 
that thing on? Yeah.

01:19.623 --> 01:21.246
Okay. My name is John B. Evans. I am 64 years of age. 
I've been born in 1916.

01:33.345 --> 01:39.394
And I predicate what I am about to say

01:33.345 --> 01:39.394
on the experience in the field of criminal 
investigation

01:40.893 --> 01:57.733
which had a tenure of in excess of 33 years in the 
fifth largest city in the United States. Which

01:58.114 --> 01:58.674
was? Houston, Texas.

02:04.601 --> 02:10.208
Let me say that in my experience I have found

02:12.432 --> 02:41.680
from the institution of criminal investigation 
all the way through the courts that a necessary

02:12.432 --> 02:41.680
item for any human being old enough to answer for 
his or her acts

02:12.432 --> 02:41.680
must be that they would be sane at the time of the 
commission of the act

02:44.225 --> 02:54.700
and aware of the consequences in the event the 
prosecution resulted as a punishment for such

02:44.225 --> 02:54.700
acts. And the only exception

02:57.244 --> 03:07.178
for adult sane human beings

03:11.157 --> 03:20.753
or adult beings would have to be insanity for which 
they could not be prosecuted because of their

03:11.157 --> 03:20.753
condition. They have no control over their acts or 
are not conscious of what their acts might result

03:20.773 --> 03:27.725
in.

03:32.233 --> 03:35.899
From the time that the assassination of John 
Fitzgerald Kennedy, President of the United

03:37.364 --> 04:04.738
States of America in 1963

03:37.364 --> 04:04.738
occurred in Dallas, Texas, I have had a theory from 
a criminal investigation that

03:37.364 --> 04:04.738
certain individuals had certain motives

04:06.018 --> 04:17.016
which led to this assassination.

04:17.036 --> 04:31.941
And I will begin with the individual whom I 
consider to have the prime motive of personal gain

04:17.036 --> 04:31.941
and prestige

04:17.036 --> 04:31.941
as a result of this incident. And that would be, at 
that time, Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson,

04:34.216 --> 04:43.787
whose motive

04:46.450 --> 05:11.142
for personal gain and power and prestige would 
have been the presidency of the United States as it

04:46.450 --> 05:11.142
was incumbent upon the vice president in the event 
a president deceases while in office to assume the

04:46.450 --> 05:11.142
office of the president of the United States.

05:15.374 --> 05:42.242
from observation

05:15.374 --> 05:42.242
of incidents a number of years prior to the 
assassination concerning Mr. Johnson and some

05:15.374 --> 05:42.242
other individuals and additional individuals 
after the fact of the assassination leads me to

05:15.374 --> 05:42.242
suspect And I firmly believe that the other 
individuals involved in that case were George

05:44.062 --> 06:11.048
Parr, who was the

05:44.062 --> 06:11.048
alleged kingpin of politics in South Texas, 
namely Duval and Starr counties,

06:14.909 --> 06:41.031
Lee Harvey Oswald, who was a former United States 
Marine and who, reliable information tells me,

06:14.909 --> 06:41.031
had received a dishonorable discharge from that 
arm of the military service.

06:41.051 --> 06:42.233
And Jack Ruby, who operated a series of

06:43.799 --> 07:11.427
questionable

06:43.799 --> 07:11.427
business establishments referred to ordinarily 
as strip-tease joints in Dallas, Texas

06:43.799 --> 07:11.427
implying the basic rules of criminal 
investigation wherein a motive is a necessary

06:43.799 --> 07:11.427
item when you reach the prosecution stage, in any 
case,

07:13.702 --> 07:21.049
to obtain a conviction.

07:24.893 --> 07:42.510
The

07:24.893 --> 07:42.510
afore stated George Parr, who was renowned to be a 
very close friend to the aforesaid Lyndon Baines

07:24.893 --> 07:42.510
Johnson for a long period of years,

07:46.996 --> 08:15.855
was led by various investigative organizations 
including the Federal Bureau of Investigation

07:46.996 --> 08:15.855
and other private citizens

07:46.996 --> 08:15.855
to have arranged

07:46.996 --> 08:15.855
so that at an election in a contest for a state 
senatorship between Lyndon Baines Johnson and

08:17.152 --> 08:44.408
Coke R. Stevenson,

08:17.152 --> 08:44.408
rather early in Johnson's career as a politician,

08:17.152 --> 08:44.408
that George Carr had arranged for the election 
returns to be reported to the election central in

08:45.839 --> 09:12.285
Dallas, Texas

08:45.839 --> 09:12.285
after an election had been held on a Saturday until 
sometime the following Wednesday, by which time

08:45.839 --> 09:12.285
most of the votes which had been reported in the 
balance of the state had had time to be fairly well

09:14.459 --> 09:29.961
canvassed before allowing the vote from Duval 
County to be reported to the election central in

09:14.459 --> 09:29.961
Dallas. And prior to the reporting of Duval County 
vote,

09:30.142 --> 09:44.162
Colt Stevenson had a slight lead in the race over 
Lyndon Johnson But Johnson would not concede the

09:45.661 --> 09:57.379
election until all of the boxers in the state were 
heard from, and that included Duval County. After

09:57.399 --> 10:09.137
the votes were finally called in, reported by 
mail, or whatever means they were reported from

09:57.399 --> 10:09.137
Duval County, Lyndon Johnson showed to have the 
89-vote lead in the race for the senator's job in

10:10.838 --> 10:22.452
the statewide election.

10:26.177 --> 10:36.930
And at that time, Colt Stevenson conceded the 
election to Lyndon Baines Johnson, and Johnson

10:26.177 --> 10:36.930
became a senator in the state of Texas.

10:40.859 --> 11:03.244
Some years later, during

10:40.859 --> 11:03.244
the administration of Harry S. Truman as 
President of the United States, it came to pass,

10:40.859 --> 11:03.244
according to the news media's reports,

10:40.859 --> 11:03.244
concerning George Parr. George Parr had been 
indicted federal court on income tax evasion or

11:10.897 --> 11:39.891
falsification of his income tax report and uh... 
summarily tried and found guilty and assessed a

11:10.897 --> 11:39.891
penalty of ten years in federal prison

11:10.897 --> 11:39.891
but after the jury had found par guilty, put the 
case on appeal, and sometime later received a

11:40.597 --> 12:01.237
presidential pardon from Harry S. Truman.

12:01.737 --> 12:06.402
Harry Truman hailed from the state of Missouri And 
no mention has ever been made publicly by anyone

12:07.478 --> 12:19.415
that Harry Truman and George Parr had ever heard of 
each other, much less know each other. So I presume

12:22.199 --> 12:29.570
that the case was that they were strangers to each 
other, unknowns to each other. Okay, can I stop you

12:29.670 --> 12:32.995
for a minute for a voice check? Sure. We're now 
resuming. I'll just take a voice check and we're

12:34.275 --> 12:42.984
going

12:34.275 --> 12:42.984
to continue. Now that

12:43.004 --> 13:00.823
Lyndon Johnson is no longer in debt to George Parr

12:43.004 --> 13:00.823
or the ballot box packing or stuffing, which 
obtained him the senator's job, according to

13:02.187 --> 13:12.959
reports

13:02.187 --> 13:12.959
from the FBI and various citizens.

13:16.463 --> 13:26.895
The contrary now held true that, uh, that Parr was 
indebted to Johnson ten years of his life.

13:31.297 --> 13:57.557
In later years,

13:31.297 --> 13:57.557
after Johnson had

13:31.297 --> 13:57.557
worked his way up to Senate Majority Leader in the 
Senate

13:31.297 --> 13:57.557
and the presidential election was to come about in 
the year of 1960, And the Democrat convention was

13:59.123 --> 14:25.367
held in San Francisco, California, wherein 
Johnson seeked the nomination of the Democrat

13:59.123 --> 14:25.367
party to run for president

13:59.123 --> 14:25.367
against Richard Milhouse Nixon, who the 
Republicans had nominated as their candidate.

14:29.060 --> 14:37.953
Johnson failed to get the nomination and the 
nomination was given to John Fitzgerald Kennedy

14:29.060 --> 14:37.953
of Massachusetts.

14:43.961 --> 14:49.549
And the

14:43.961 --> 14:49.549
feeling of the party was that the state of Texas 
would be a necessary item of support in order for

14:50.288 --> 15:00.358
Kennedy to win the election. And therefore, the 
position of candidacy for the vice presidency

15:02.600 --> 15:16.093
was submitted to Johnson and he accepted.

15:21.895 --> 15:47.903
In 1958, I believe,

15:21.895 --> 15:47.903
Mr. George Parr, who still politically ruled 
Duval County,

15:21.895 --> 15:47.903
managed to get his hands on some of the county's 
school funds.

15:50.752 --> 16:16.101
and was indicted by a state grand jury, tried in the 
state district court, found guilty of felony

15:50.752 --> 16:16.101
theft of school funds, assessed the then maximum 
penalty for felony theft in the first defense of 10

15:50.752 --> 16:16.101
years to be served in what was then known as the 
T.S.P.S. Texas State Prison

16:19.989 --> 16:24.375
System. This case was put on appeal and Parr 
remained free on appeal bond

16:24.395 --> 16:43.658
as the case wound its way through the Court of 
Criminal Appeals and would have ultimately gone

16:24.395 --> 16:43.658
to the state Supreme Court.

16:48.228 --> 17:11.709
During the interim, the 1960 election, the 
President of the United States occurred, and John

16:48.228 --> 17:11.709
Fitzgerald Kennedy was elected President and 
then named Johnson Vice President of the United

16:48.228 --> 17:11.709
States.

17:11.729 --> 17:15.653
To the best of my recollection of what occurred,

17:18.113 --> 17:33.328
The inauguration of Kennedy and Johnson was on or 
about the 12th of January,

17:18.113 --> 17:33.328
1961.

17:33.348 --> 17:43.058
And sometime

17:33.348 --> 17:43.058
between the middle and the end of March that same 
year,

17:43.409 --> 17:56.562
George Parr received presidential pardon from 
John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who was found dead.

17:56.582 --> 18:10.817
All of these matters would of necessity appear in 
the official records of the government of the

17:56.582 --> 18:10.817
United States and state of Texas, official court 
records and so forth.

18:14.105 --> 18:21.716
pertaining to these convictions and pardons.

18:21.796 --> 18:40.062
Time proceeded on, and during the summer of 1963, 
the

18:21.796 --> 18:40.062
Democrat Party in the state of Texas became split 
into several different factions.

18:42.083 --> 18:48.109
I believe there was about seven, all told. And

18:48.129 --> 18:57.618
Lyndon Johnson calls the year of 1964 was to be a 
presidential election year again.

19:00.961 --> 19:10.690
And it was reported in the news media that he had had

19:00.961 --> 19:10.690
a talk with President Kennedy and at that time, 
Governor John B. Conley, governor of the state of

19:11.260 --> 19:37.032
Texas, to the effect that he and Johnson and the 
president should come to Texas on what he termed a

19:11.260 --> 19:37.032
fence-mending tour in order to get the

19:11.260 --> 19:37.032
Democrat Party all back into one corral. These 
terms are used among Texas ranchers pertaining to

19:38.817 --> 19:56.383
cattle, but Texas politicians use the same 
terminology pertaining to voters.

19:56.403 --> 20:06.377
And at first, because of some incidents which had 
occurred in Dallas, Texas,

19:56.403 --> 20:06.377
when Adlai E. Stevenson, Sr., a senator from the 
state of Illinois, and a retired general by the

20:06.745 --> 20:28.956
name of Walker, who lived in Dallas, Texas,

20:06.745 --> 20:28.956
and several other rather prominent national 
figures. The Democratic Party had attempted to

20:29.276 --> 20:35.385
make speeches in Dallas, Texas, they received 
vegetables and eggs some sticks and stones

20:35.939 --> 20:59.078
directed at the speakers

20:35.939 --> 20:59.078
instead of any applause or exception of their 
speech

20:35.939 --> 20:59.078
also Well, publicized at the time, General Walker 
had sustained a bullet hole in the picture window

20:59.885 --> 21:15.430
of his living room in his home in Dallas, Texas, and 
sustained a near miss from the bullet that put the

20:59.885 --> 21:15.430
hole there.

21:19.865 --> 21:32.254
So that it was published

21:19.865 --> 21:32.254
by the news media, newspapers, radio and 
television. John Connolly had advised against

21:34.495 --> 21:52.538
the President and the Vice President both coming 
to Texas at the same time, together, going to

21:34.495 --> 21:52.538
various municipalities in the state on this 
fence-mending tour because it was dangerous. And

21:52.558 --> 21:56.503
especially the attitude of the people in Dallas, 
Texas.

21:59.555 --> 22:20.694
But somehow Johnson, according to reports in the 
news media, persuaded the President and Governor

21:59.555 --> 22:20.694
Connolly that he and the President would not 
receive any such treatment even in Dallas.

22:24.157 --> 22:27.840
So they decided to come to Dallas. and immediately 
the news media began to publish stories about the

22:28.411 --> 22:54.537
anticipated visit of the President and the Vice 
President, detailing when they would be in each

22:28.411 --> 22:54.537
municipality that they were to visit,

22:28.411 --> 22:54.537
and publishing in the newspapers prominently 
displayed on the front pages the planned

22:56.204 --> 23:07.681
motorcade route that they would follow through 
each of these municipalities as they progressed

22:56.204 --> 23:07.681
on their visitation. These diagrams were also 
displayed on television quite frequently in each

23:07.701 --> 23:17.616
of these cities.

23:17.636 --> 23:21.942
And so that it would be common knowledge to the 
people who might want to have a chance to see their

23:22.445 --> 23:44.470
president and vice president and their governor 
all simultaneously

23:22.445 --> 23:44.470
be able to position themselves along these 
motorcade routes for that purpose.

23:49.597 --> 24:08.405
prior to becoming governor of the state of Texas, 
John B. Connolly served as a cabinet level

23:49.597 --> 24:08.405
in Washington, D.C. in the capacity of Secretary 
of the Navy. And during that tenure, Lee Harvey

24:10.368 --> 24:16.617
Oswald received his dishonorable discharge from 
the Marine Corps.

24:23.789 --> 24:44.292
And it has been publicized considerably that 
Oswald had written letters to John Connolly

24:23.789 --> 24:44.292
requesting that he as Secretary of the Navy review 
his case and consider an upgrade from

24:45.976 --> 24:59.612
dishonorable to something more desirable in the 
way of a discharge, and that Oswald was ignored by

24:45.976 --> 24:59.612
Connolly.

25:03.417 --> 25:14.430
During the summer and early fall, while all the 
publicity was going around to the news media,

25:17.262 --> 25:45.396
across the state, possibly across the country,

25:17.262 --> 25:45.396
pertaining to the visit of the president and vice 
president and the governor of these

25:17.262 --> 25:45.396
municipalities,

25:17.262 --> 25:45.396
Lee Harvey Oswald, somehow, in spite of the 
reported sustenance of two homes, one in Fort

25:17.262 --> 25:45.396
Worth and one in Dallas, without being employed at 
all, managed to defray the expense of making a trip

25:47.080 --> 25:56.376
to Mexico City.

26:01.986 --> 26:08.818
And according to what has been published of the FBI 
report and the Warren report, Oswald crossed the

26:10.418 --> 26:38.316
Rio Grande River at a small village called Roma, 
Texas, which is the connecting bridge between

26:10.418 --> 26:38.316
Starr County, the county seat of which is Rio 
Grande City,

26:10.418 --> 26:38.316
and

26:10.418 --> 26:38.316
Old Mexico.

26:41.722 --> 26:48.671
This was also alleged to have been the route that he 
was traced in returning from Mexico City back to

26:41.722 --> 26:48.671
Dallas. It was reported by both the FBI and the 
Warren Commission that Oswald was traced to the

26:50.994 --> 27:04.911
Cuban consulate in Mexico City, as well as the 
Russian consulate, but did not hold any

27:05.262 --> 27:19.856
conversation, transact any business with anyone 
at either of these locations

27:05.262 --> 27:19.856
and return to Dallas, Texas. There has been no 
mention made of any investigation which would

27:19.876 --> 27:32.248
clarify whether or not Oswald contacted anybody 
north of the border of the Rio Grande and say in

27:32.887 --> 27:52.425
Starr County or Duval County en route to Mexico 
City and back

27:32.887 --> 27:52.425
by either the FBI or

27:32.887 --> 27:52.425
the Warren Commission. At the time this was all 
going on in 1963,

27:52.445 --> 28:02.775
George Parr's nephew, Archer Parr, was county 
sheriff in Starr

28:03.447 --> 28:12.660
County. During this same period, Jack Ruby, the 
Gurley nightclub operator,

28:12.680 --> 28:29.843
for some mysterious reason, became exceedingly 
friendly with a lot of members of the Dallas Police

28:30.278 --> 28:48.757
Department, or at least this is what they and the 
FBI and the Warren Commission all concur is fact.

28:48.777 --> 28:59.188
And my experience as a municipal police officer 
taught me long ago that this is highly unusual for

28:48.777 --> 28:59.188
people in that type of business. to do anything 
regarding police except try to avoid them.

29:10.603 --> 29:21.457
Certainly not to be visiting the police station 
and getting well acquainted with the high ranking

29:10.603 --> 29:21.457
officials and all this.

29:21.477 --> 29:27.505
Now,

29:21.477 --> 29:27.505
it is my belief that

29:29.695 --> 29:48.219
Lee Harvey Oswald was afforded an opportunity by 
someone

29:29.695 --> 29:48.219
to have an opportunity to take revenge against 
John Connolly, not John Kennedy.

29:51.222 --> 29:55.568
There has been nothing to indicate there be any 
motivation whatsoever or Lee Harvey Oswald to

29:57.168 --> 30:05.977
want to kill John Kennedy. But there is sufficient 
motive in the ignoring of his plea for help

30:05.997 --> 30:26.179
pertaining to his dishonorable discharge from 
John Connolly to cause an individual with a

30:05.997 --> 30:26.179
temperament that the people who claim to know him 
said that Oswald had

30:26.986 --> 30:40.260
to try to assassinate John Connolly.

30:40.280 --> 30:51.151
And John Connolly was struck by some of the bullets 
that were fired into the car in which he and Kennedy

30:40.280 --> 30:51.151
were riding. Can I ask you a question? Was the 
motorcade route that they traveled by the

30:55.100 --> 31:04.250
depository, was that pre-planned or was that a 
last-minute change? The chief police of the city

31:06.272 --> 31:23.470
of Dallas at that time wrote a book, which is easily 
available to anybody that wants it, in almost any

31:06.272 --> 31:23.470
bookstore and certainly any library,

31:06.272 --> 31:23.470
stating that... approximately 30 minutes before 
departure time for the motorcade with the

31:24.277 --> 31:52.663
President Kennedy and Vice President Johnson and 
Governor John Connolly and their wives

31:24.277 --> 31:52.663
had been changed around the motorcade, had been 
changed approximately 30 minutes prior to

31:24.277 --> 31:52.663
departure time so that it went by the book storage 
building where Oswald was alleged to have shot the

31:53.791 --> 32:11.794
president.

32:11.814 --> 32:21.626
And he was never able to determine who ordered this 
altering of the mocade route.

32:21.646 --> 32:23.308
But the order did come, The route was changed so 
that the motorcade did pass by that building.

32:35.003 --> 32:46.478
Of course,

32:35.003 --> 32:46.478
I have not mentioned the motive of Jack Ruby for any 
part in the assassination.

32:49.951 --> 33:15.688
But I have known many people of many religious 
organizations,

32:49.951 --> 33:15.688
and I have rather consistently found that there is 
still a great deal of animosity between Baptists

32:49.951 --> 33:15.688
and Catholics, and even more between Jews and 
Catholics.

33:19.381 --> 33:45.996
And Al Smith was rejected

33:19.381 --> 33:45.996
by a Democrat state who elected to support Herbert 
Clark Hoover much heavier than they did Al Smith in

33:19.381 --> 33:45.996
1928.

33:47.883 --> 33:57.816
for the presidency of this country because Al 
Smith was Catholic and no other reason was ever

33:47.883 --> 33:57.816
given.

33:57.836 --> 34:16.742
And that was the only Republican that was ever 
supported the majority of the voters in the state

33:57.836 --> 34:16.742
of Texas for the presidency since the state of 
Texas has been in existence as a state

34:21.177 --> 34:26.664
The next one that ever was was Richard Nixon.

34:29.387 --> 34:41.782
And his

34:29.387 --> 34:41.782
margin was not nearly as great as Hoover's.

34:41.802 --> 34:47.910
Now the circumstances indicate to me that Jack 
Ruby was in on the conspiracy

34:48.886 --> 35:12.414
for the purpose of making sure that Lee Harvey 
Oswald did not tell authorities too much in the

34:48.886 --> 35:12.414
event he got caught and wasn't killed in the 
process of what transpired.

35:16.379 --> 35:17.020
And

35:19.868 --> 35:21.430
That is exactly what he did. And he became a common 
sight around the Dallas Police Station so that he

35:22.391 --> 35:39.931
could gain access to Oswald sufficient to allow 
him to hush him up by taking his life. And when the

35:39.951 --> 35:49.842
transfer on a Sunday morning after the 
assassination from the Dallas City Police

35:39.951 --> 35:49.842
Station to the Dallas County Jail was attempted.

35:57.397 --> 36:11.856
Millions of people who were watching the 
proceedings live on television from that

35:57.397 --> 36:11.856
location

35:57.397 --> 36:11.856
can attest to the fact that that is exactly what 
Jack Ruby did.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.943
And no one ever offered any motive for Jack Ruby's 
actions other than that he just thought so much of

36:17.800 --> 36:32.519
the president of the United States that he decided 
to kill the man that was alleged to have killed him.

36:32.539 --> 36:47.098
But this does not explain why a strip joint 
operator prior to any assassination or any threat

36:32.539 --> 36:47.098
of it or anything else on the president got himself 
so familiarized around the Dallas police station

36:47.585 --> 36:57.500
that he could gain access to Oswald in

36:47.585 --> 36:57.500
the first place.

37:00.685 --> 37:13.103
In so far as I have been able to determine what has 
been released in the way of even basic criminal

37:00.685 --> 37:13.103
investigative efforts, on the part of either the 
FBI or the Warren Commission in the tracing of

37:15.074 --> 37:41.672
Oswald's

37:15.074 --> 37:41.672
movements to Mexico City and back and tracing the 
rifle which was alleged to have been the murder

37:15.074 --> 37:41.672
weapon

37:44.116 --> 38:08.988
and which was reportedly left behind in the book 
storage building to Lee Harvey Oswald

37:44.116 --> 38:08.988
and making ballistics tests and checking this 
weapon for fingerprints.

38:09.008 --> 38:10.950
Other elements of The criminal investigation 
appeared to me to be rather nil, and no one ever did

38:11.572 --> 38:31.453
offer any true motivation on the part of Oswald 
having taken the life of the president, or even

38:11.572 --> 38:31.453
attempting the life of his own son. The only 
explanation that has ever been said that I've

38:32.092 --> 38:42.662
heard is the possible links of KGB because of his 
departure to Russia. And what is your opinion on

38:44.504 --> 38:45.966
that? The belief was that Oswald appeared to be, 
from these accounts, Oswald was linked to the

38:45.986 --> 38:59.719
Russian KGB and

39:03.563 --> 39:23.428
This was supposed to have been determined by the 
CIA prior to what transpired in Dallas, but no tail

39:03.563 --> 39:23.428
was placed on Lee Harvey Oswald at that time to see 
what he was doing during this locating.

39:25.501 --> 39:28.125
proceedings through the city of Dallas. Isn't it 
common for anybody who has ever had anything to do

39:30.208 --> 39:49.618
with maybe even a threat to the president or with 
suspected links to the KGB to have Secret Service

39:30.208 --> 39:49.618
men around them or at least following them? not 
only applies to the president, but all members of

39:49.885 --> 40:04.048
his family, the vice president, and all members of 
his family, and any serious candidate for the

39:49.885 --> 40:04.048
presidency at all. This is besides... the 
bodyguards of the candidate or the president

40:06.980 --> 40:19.932
themselves, but they do also, any person that they 
believe will threaten, isn't it usual that they

40:06.980 --> 40:19.932
will go and that they will watch that person? It is 
my understanding that especially that during a

40:19.952 --> 40:34.185
time when there's a when the president or any 
member of his family is known to be in the proximity

40:35.330 --> 40:53.577
of any individual who might be believed to be a 
foreign agent, a spy,

40:35.330 --> 40:53.577
would certainly be placed under very close 
surveillance, at least during that time. It would

40:53.597 --> 41:04.594
be a special effort to keep them under closer than 
normal surveillance by FBI, CIA, Secret Service,

40:53.597 --> 41:04.594
all of them.

41:09.805 --> 41:38.226
But I

41:09.805 --> 41:38.226
noticed that after

41:09.805 --> 41:38.226
Lyndon Johnson was deceased,

41:09.805 --> 41:38.226
George Parr got tangled up in another theft 
business case and was tried and found guilty again

41:09.805 --> 41:38.226
and assessed prison term. What was this other 
case, can you say? This other case after Linda

41:44.275 --> 41:49.022
Johnson's death, what was this other case? I 
believe it was something pertaining to the county

41:49.042 --> 41:58.335
treasury funds in Duval County. At any rate, they 
found him dead where he According to the

42:04.835 --> 42:28.070
investigation that followed that, the victim of 
suicide, since there was no way of getting another

42:04.835 --> 42:28.070
presidential pardon, because Johnson was no 
longer around,

42:04.835 --> 42:28.070
there wasn't anybody to prevail upon any 
president then to give him a pardon. It was a

42:28.090 --> 42:31.996
suicide.

42:32.016 --> 42:32.597
This, uh, which further convinces me that Johnson 
was engineering the two presidential pardons

42:33.944 --> 42:47.401
that he

42:33.944 --> 42:47.401
did get. Were you ever a patrolman in Starr County 
yourself? Have I ever been there? Have you ever

42:54.710 --> 42:58.074
been a patrolman in Starr County? Never been a 
patrolman there. I was a soldier there. At the time

43:00.522 --> 43:12.121
that Ruby Clifton had gone to Mexico, is there any 
knowledge of him having stopped before he had

43:00.522 --> 43:12.121
crossed the border? I have never heard anything 
pertaining to that whatsoever.

43:19.878 --> 43:36.616
Nothing stipulated that any effort was made on the 
part of the FBI or the Warren Commission, either

43:19.878 --> 43:36.616
one, to see if he did actually stop in Rio Grande 
City or figure off through Duval County or some

43:19.878 --> 43:36.616
other place and make any contact with anybody. 
There's never been anything published saying

43:36.636 --> 43:43.624
that he did, and nothing published saying that he 
didn't. But there was certainly every

43:45.460 --> 43:55.391
opportunity in the world for him to have done so 
because he had to go directly through Rio Grande

43:45.460 --> 43:55.391
City. And wasn't that the only bridge, the only 
access to Mexico through that route at that time?

44:03.921 --> 44:13.932
That is the, between, I believe, well, it was then, 
and I think still is, next place west or northwest

44:14.435 --> 44:32.607
on the Rio Grande that you could cross on a bridge 
after you leave Reynosa,

44:14.435 --> 44:32.607
McAllen and Reynosa. I don't think there was 
another bridge until you got to Roma at that time

44:32.627 --> 44:38.738
and only one highway which ran right through the 
middle of town, and the railroad track ran

44:39.612 --> 44:48.441
parallel to it up to Rio Grande City. And there, 
there was a Y formed in the track so that the engines

44:48.461 --> 44:59.914
could turn around and go to the other end of the 
train and go back to Mission.

45:05.039 --> 45:09.484
And having been stationed at Fort Ringgold, which 
was an army post for the United States Cavalry, 1st

45:10.747 --> 45:15.634
Cavalry Division. From August the 7th of 1940 to 
around the middle of February of 1941, I

45:17.316 --> 45:37.845
had an occasion to find out that that was the only 
road through

45:17.316 --> 45:37.845
there. You've said And I want to get it down. What is 
your belief that why Johnson would accept the

45:41.010 --> 45:49.239
nomination for vice president? Was it an ulterior 
motive? Or why would Kennedy... It would appear to

45:53.604 --> 46:02.674
me that since Johnson already held the position of 
Senate Majority Leader, which was much more

46:03.059 --> 46:30.012
powerful and prestigious than that of Vice 
President, and second only to the President

46:03.059 --> 46:30.012
himself,

46:03.059 --> 46:30.012
that Johnson's only hope to ever be President, 
which he was seeking to be at the 1960 Democratic

46:03.059 --> 46:30.012
Convention,

46:03.059 --> 46:30.012
and made no bones about it, that his only chance 
would be to become vice president and then the

46:32.168 --> 46:52.167
president when he was serving with the decision 
officer become incapable of carrying on the

46:32.168 --> 46:52.167
duties of the

46:32.168 --> 46:52.167
president. Might also be noted that Judge Cyril T. 
Hughes was a federal judge who for Ann Johnson as

47:02.071 --> 47:10.119
president aboard Air Force One in Dallas, Texas. 
Some, according to the news media, 30 minutes

47:10.140 --> 47:29.580
after

47:10.140 --> 47:29.580
the president had been pronounced dead

47:10.140 --> 47:29.580
and that she was

47:10.140 --> 47:29.580
suggested so the story goes, by Johnson to be 
nominated for the federal jet-ship by the

47:30.910 --> 47:39.839
president. And she was appointed and was 
confirmed to the Senate. Okay. Is it you believe

47:47.567 --> 47:54.814
that without Johnson's support in Texas, Kennedy 
could have carried Texas? I always figured that

47:58.501 --> 48:25.308
because he was a Catholic more than any other, and 
the Great Baptist Belt runs through the heart of

47:58.501 --> 48:25.308
Texas and spreads almost to the borders in both 
directions,

47:58.501 --> 48:25.308
that he would have not had much better luck than Al 
Smith

47:58.501 --> 48:25.308
did. Al Smith did not have a run in April, Texas.

48:33.567 --> 48:52.487
I want it to be known that this is my analysis of this 
case, what I've been able to learn about it, what

48:33.567 --> 48:52.487
has been published and printed by the news media 
and what has been released by the Warren

48:33.567 --> 48:52.487
Commission.
