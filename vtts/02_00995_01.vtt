WEBVTT

00:02.640 --> 00:04.802
Mic test 1, 2, 3. Mic test 1, 2, 3. I'm in the process 
of conducting an interview with somebody dealing

00:06.640 --> 00:12.970
with the assassination of John F. Kennedy. My name 
is Eugene Sepulveda. Today is March the 12th,

00:14.442 --> 00:17.970
1980. This is just another volume test, just 
another volume. Okay, but were you in the rank of a

00:22.260 --> 00:29.200
detective or were you in the rank of a police 
patrolman? Eight years as a detective, ten years

00:29.180 --> 00:33.200
as a lieutenant detective. Okay,

00:33.180 --> 00:45.000
so could I have this again? If this is correct, 
please correct me. My name is John B. Evans. You're

00:49.980 --> 00:56.537
33 and a half years as a policeman, eight years as a 
detective, and two years as a lieutenant

00:49.980 --> 00:56.537
detective. Is that correct? No. Okay. All in the 
Criminal Investigation Bureau, they call it. All

01:03.980 --> 01:07.000
right. Can you just kind of start off like we 
started talking yesterday? Okay. Yeah. You got

01:13.440 --> 01:15.700
that thing on? Yeah.

01:21.302 --> 01:23.310
My name is John B. Evans. I am 64 years of age. I've 
been born in 1916. And

01:29.860 --> 01:45.680
I predicate what I am about to say

01:29.860 --> 01:45.680
on experience in the field of criminal 
investigation, which

01:45.660 --> 01:51.980
had a tenure of in excess of 33 years. In the fifth 
largest city in the United States. Which was?

01:58.821 --> 01:59.780
Houston, Texas. Let

01:59.760 --> 02:14.710
me say that in my experience, I have found

01:59.760 --> 02:14.710
in the institution of criminal investigation, 
all the way through the courts, that a necessary

02:14.690 --> 02:29.320
item for any human being old enough to answer for 
his or her acts, must

02:29.300 --> 02:40.880
be that they would be sane at the time of the 
commission of the act, and

02:40.860 --> 02:54.370
aware of the consequences in the event the 
prosecution resulted as a punishment for such

02:40.860 --> 02:54.370
acts. And

02:54.350 --> 03:13.670
the only exception

02:54.350 --> 03:13.670
for adult sane human beings

02:54.350 --> 03:13.670
or adult beings would have to be insanity. For 
which they could not be prosecuted under their

03:13.650 --> 03:20.740
condition. They have no control over their acts or 
not conscious of what their acts might result in.

03:27.930 --> 03:39.790
From

03:27.930 --> 03:39.790
the time that the assassination of John 
Fitzgerald Kennedy, President of the United

03:39.770 --> 03:44.790
States of America in 1963, occurred in Dallas, 
Texas, I have had a, had a theory from a criminal

03:51.680 --> 04:00.850
investigation point,

04:00.830 --> 04:11.220
that certain individuals had certain motives,

04:11.200 --> 04:17.440
which led to this assassination.

04:17.420 --> 04:25.440
I will begin with the individual whom I consider to 
have the prime motive, personal gain and

04:25.420 --> 04:29.780
prestige, as a result of this incident. And that 
would be, at that time, Vice President Lyndon

04:37.250 --> 04:42.790
Baines Johnson,

04:42.770 --> 04:50.630
whose motive,

04:42.770 --> 04:50.630
personal gain and power and prestige, would have 
been presidency of the United States. As it is

04:54.610 --> 05:02.020
incumbent upon the Vice President, in the event a 
President deceases, while in office, to assume

05:06.730 --> 05:10.750
the office of President of the United States.

05:15.210 --> 05:21.560
From observation of incidents, a number of years 
prior to the assassination, concerning Mr.

05:26.520 --> 05:29.400
Johnson, and some other individuals, and 
additional individuals, after the fact of the

05:33.720 --> 05:38.410
assassination, leads me to suspect, and I firmly 
believe, that the other individuals involved in

05:46.030 --> 05:51.870
that case, were

05:51.850 --> 05:58.920
George Parr, who was the

05:58.900 --> 06:08.620
alleged kingpin of politics in South Texas, 
namely Duval and Starr counties,

06:14.700 --> 06:16.720
Lee Harvey Oswald, who was a former United States 
Marine, and

06:24.950 --> 06:32.350
who, reliable information tells me, had 
received, at this honorable discharge, from that

06:35.330 --> 06:38.350
arm of the military service. And Jack Ruby, who 
operated a series of questionable

06:46.420 --> 06:55.900
business establishments, referred to 
ordinarily as striptease joints, in Dallas,

06:58.880 --> 07:01.150
Texas, implying the basic rules of criminal 
investigation, wherein a motive is a necessary

07:07.660 --> 07:11.680
item, when you reach the prosecution stage, in any 
case, to obtain a conviction.

07:24.970 --> 07:33.180
The

07:24.970 --> 07:33.180
afore stated George Parr, who was renowned to be a 
very close friend, to the aforesaid Lyndon Baines

07:36.570 --> 07:40.590
Johnson, for a long period of years, was

07:42.570 --> 07:52.580
alleged by various investigative 
organizations, including the Federal Bureau of

07:52.560 --> 07:55.580
Investigation, and other, private citizens, to 
have arranged so that, at an election, in a contest

08:09.050 --> 08:13.310
for a state senatorship, between Lyndon Baines 
Johnson, and Coke R. Stevenson, rather

08:20.620 --> 08:29.630
early in Johnson's career as a politician, that

08:29.610 --> 08:43.350
George Parr had

08:29.610 --> 08:43.350
arranged for the, the election returns to be 
reported, to the election central in Dallas,

08:49.440 --> 08:55.550
Texas, after an election had been held on a 
Saturday, until sometime the following

09:00.200 --> 09:03.660
Wednesday, by which time, the, most of the votes 
which had been reported, in the balance of the

09:10.780 --> 09:14.420
state, had had time to be fairly well canvassed,

09:20.830 --> 09:21.851
a vote from Duval County, to be, reported to, the 
election central in Dallas, and prior to the,

09:31.800 --> 09:34.820
reporting of Duval County vote, Coke

09:34.800 --> 09:42.010
Stevenson had a slight lead, in the race over 
Lyndon Johnson, but Johnson would not concede the

09:45.650 --> 09:48.670
election, until all of the boxers in the state, 
were heard from, and that included Duval County,

09:56.030 --> 10:01.780
after the, votes were finally called in, or 
reported by mail, or whatever means they were

10:03.760 --> 10:05.780
reported, from Duval County, and Lyndon Johnson, 
showed to have an 89 vote lead, in the race for the

10:16.620 --> 10:19.640
Senator's job, in the statewide election, and

10:22.570 --> 10:27.660
at that time, Coke Stevenson, conceded the 
election to, Lyndon Baines Johnson, became a

10:33.690 --> 10:35.710
Senator, in the state

10:35.690 --> 10:41.160
of Texas, some years later, during

10:43.140 --> 10:49.230
the, administration of Harry S. Truman, as 
President of the United States, it came to pass,

10:54.450 --> 10:56.470
according to the, news media's reports, 
concerning George Parr, George Parr had been,

11:07.730 --> 11:12.270
indicted,

11:07.730 --> 11:12.270
by federal court, on

11:12.250 --> 11:17.590
income tax evasion, or falsification, of his 
income tax report, uh,

11:20.570 --> 11:24.570
summarily, tried, found guilty, assessed the 
penalty of 10 years, in federal

11:30.180 --> 11:35.390
prison, but after, the, jury had found, Parr 
guilty, put the case on appeal, and

11:43.400 --> 11:50.280
uh, sometime later, received a presidential 
pardon, from Harry S. Truman, Harry

11:56.430 --> 12:04.330
Truman, hailed from, the state of Missouri, and no 
mention, has ever been made, publicly, by anyone,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.260
that Harry Truman, and George Parr, had ever, 
heard of each other, much less, know each other, so

12:22.050 --> 12:23.071
I presume, that the case was, that they were, 
strangers to each other, unknowns, to each other.

12:28.050 --> 12:30.540
Okay, can I stop you, for a minute, for a voice 
check? Sure. When I was zooming, I just took a voice

12:34.520 --> 12:35.541
check, and we're gonna continue. Yeah, that's 
perfect. Now

12:37.520 --> 12:46.730
that,

12:37.520 --> 12:46.730
uh, Lyndon Johnson, was no longer in debt, to 
George Parr, or

12:51.710 --> 12:57.390
the, uh, ballot box packing, or stuffing, which 
obtained him, the, senator's job, according to,

13:05.090 --> 13:10.380
reports from the FBI, and, uh, various citizens,

13:12.360 --> 13:16.990
the, uh, contrary, now held true, that,

13:19.970 --> 13:23.040
uh, Parr was indebted, to Johnson, for ten years of

13:24.020 --> 13:31.460
his life. In later years, after,

13:32.440 --> 13:36.750
Johnson had, uh, worked

13:36.730 --> 13:42.260
his way up, to Senate Majority Leader, in the 
Senate, and

13:44.240 --> 13:48.420
the, uh, presidential election, came, was to come 
about, in the year of 1960, and, the Democrat

13:54.050 --> 13:56.070
Convention, was held, at San Francisco, 
California, wherein, uh, Johnson, uh, was

14:03.200 --> 14:05.430
elected, uh, and, Johnson, seeked the, uh, 
nomination, of the Democratic Party, to run for

14:12.850 --> 14:13.871
President, against,

14:13.850 --> 14:18.040
uh, Richard, Milhouse, Nixon, who the, uh, 
Republicans, had nominated,

14:24.490 --> 14:29.670
as their candidate. Johnson failed, to get the 
nomination, and the nomination, was given, to,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.020
uh, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, of Massachusetts,

14:37.000 --> 14:44.100
and, uh,

14:47.660 --> 14:49.680
the feeling, of the, uh, party, was that, uh, the 
state of Texas, would be, uh, necessary, item of

14:56.720 --> 14:58.920
support, in order for Kennedy, to win, the 
election. And, therefore, the, uh, position, of,

15:10.640 --> 15:13.930
uh, candidacy, for the Vice Presidency, was,

15:14.910 --> 15:23.510
uh, submitted to, Johnson, and he accepted. 1958, 
I believe, uh,

15:30.300 --> 15:34.560
politically, ruled, uh, Duval

15:37.560 --> 15:42.114
County. Managed to get his hands, on, uh, some of 
the county's, school funds,

15:46.570 --> 15:52.460
and was indicted, by a state grand jury, tried, in 
state district court, and found guilty, of felony

16:00.820 --> 16:03.090
theft, of school funds, assessed, uh, then 
maximum penalty, for felony theft, first

16:09.500 --> 16:11.520
offense, of ten years, to be served, and, uh, what 
was then known, as the, uh, TSPS, Texas State

16:18.370 --> 16:24.300
Prison

16:18.370 --> 16:24.300
System. This case, was, uh, put on appeal, and par, 
remained free, on appeal bond. The

16:32.400 --> 16:37.540
case wound its way, through the Court of Criminal 
Appeals, and would have ultimately, gone to the

16:41.520 --> 16:48.380
State Supreme

16:41.520 --> 16:48.380
Court. During the, uh, interim, the 1960 
election, the President of the United States,

16:54.790 --> 17:01.780
occurred,

16:54.790 --> 17:01.780
and John Fitzgerald Kennedy, was elected 
President, and then named, Johnson, Vice

17:04.760 --> 17:06.780
President, of the United States.

17:11.690 --> 17:12.711
To the best of my, recollection, of what occurred, 
the,

17:15.690 --> 17:19.560
uh, inauguration, of, uh, Kennedy, and Johnson, 
as owner, about the, 12th of January, 1961.

17:33.399 --> 17:33.580
And, sometime,

17:33.560 --> 17:37.260
between the middle, and the end, of the month of 
March, that same year, George

17:40.240 --> 17:45.460
Parr, received presidential pardon, from John 
Fitzgerald Kennedy, for this felony theft. These

17:49.440 --> 17:58.370
matters, uh, would of necessity, appear, in the 
official records, of the, government of the

18:01.350 --> 18:03.870
United States, and State of Texas, official court 
records, and so forth. Pertaining

18:10.480 --> 18:14.780
to these, uh, convictions, and pardons,

18:16.760 --> 18:22.940
proceeded on, and during

18:22.920 --> 18:26.720
the summer, of 1963, the Democratic Party, in the 
State of Texas, became split into, several

18:32.450 --> 18:33.471
different factions. I believe, there was about 
seven, all total. And, uh,

18:38.470 --> 18:42.850
Lyndon Johnson, because the year of 1964, was to be 
a presidential election, year again, and it was

18:44.920 --> 18:48.750
reported, in the news media, that he had, uh, had a 
talk, with, uh, the President of the United

18:56.520 --> 18:57.541
States, and,

18:57.520 --> 19:02.250
uh, the President of the United States, and,

19:03.230 --> 19:07.100
uh, had a talk, with, uh, President Kennedy, and at 
that time, Governor John D. Conley, Governor of

19:15.100 --> 19:17.880
the State of Texas, to the effect, that he, and the, 
Johnson, and, uh, the President, should come to

19:24.860 --> 19:25.881
Texas, on what he termed, a fence-mending tour, in 
order to get the, uh,

19:31.360 --> 19:35.130
Democratic Party, hauled back into one corral. 
These terms, are used, among the Texas ranks. So,

19:41.600 --> 19:43.620
there's a lot of, uh, different answers, 
pertaining to cattle, but, uh, Texas

19:48.600 --> 19:50.900
politicians, use the same terminology, 
pertaining

19:50.880 --> 19:56.570
to voters. And, at first, uh, because of some 
incidents, which had occurred, in Dallas, Texas,

20:06.730 --> 20:07.751
Adlai E. Stevenson, senior, a senator from the 
State of Illinois, and a retired General, named

20:10.920 --> 20:12.940
Walker, who lived in, uh, Dallas, Texas, and 
several other, uh, federal officials, and,

20:20.820 --> 20:33.600
other rather prominent national figures, the 
Democratic Party had attempted to make speeches

20:33.580 --> 20:35.245
in Dallas, Texas. They received vegetables and 
eggs, some sticks and stones directed at the

20:46.500 --> 20:55.318
speakers

20:46.500 --> 20:55.318
instead of any applause or exception of their 
speech.

20:58.203 --> 21:01.470
Also, well publicized at the time, General Walker 
had sustained a bullet hole in the picture window

21:01.450 --> 21:09.730
of his living room in his home in Dallas, Texas and 
sustained a near miss from the bullet that put

21:09.710 --> 21:20.677
the hole there. So that it was published to me by the 
Democratic Party. Some unseen historical

21:27.510 --> 21:36.880
figures

21:27.510 --> 21:36.880
went on to plot oricans all over the place, the news 
media, newspapers, radio, and television. John

21:39.136 --> 21:42.420
Connelly had advised against the president and 
the vice president both coming to Texas at the same

21:42.400 --> 21:50.390
time together going to the various 
municipalities in the state on this fence mending

21:50.370 --> 22:01.710
tour because it was dangerous and especially the

21:50.370 --> 22:01.710
attitude of the people in Dallas, Texas, that 
somehow Johnson, according report in the News

22:01.690 --> 22:03.750
MeDIA, outside of Texas came to Texas because it 
was dangerous. media, persuaded the President

22:04.690 --> 22:17.160
and Governor Connolly that he and the President 
would not receive any such treatment, even in

22:17.140 --> 22:20.712
Dallas.

22:24.163 --> 22:29.140
So they decided to come to Dallas, and immediately 
the news media began to publish stories about the

22:29.120 --> 22:38.140
anticipated visit of the President and Vice 
President, detailing when they would be in each

22:38.120 --> 22:45.780
municipality that they were to visit,

22:45.760 --> 22:58.160
and publishing in the newspapers prominently 
displayed on the front pages the planned

22:45.760 --> 22:58.160
motorcade route that they would follow through 
each of these municipalities as they progressed

23:04.090 --> 23:07.702
on their visitation. These diagrams were also 
displayed on television quite frequently, so

23:13.360 --> 23:25.110
that

23:13.360 --> 23:25.110
it would be common knowledge to the people who 
might want to have a chance to see the President and

23:25.090 --> 23:33.830
Vice President and their Governor all 
simultaneously,

23:25.090 --> 23:33.830
to be able to position themselves along these 
motorcade routes for that purpose.

23:44.248 --> 23:51.240
Now,

23:44.248 --> 23:51.240
prior to becoming Governor of the State of Texas, 
John B. Connally served as a deputy governor of the

23:51.220 --> 23:57.590
state of Texas. as a cabinet level,

24:00.358 --> 24:08.420
Washington, D.C., in the capacity of Secretary of 
the Navy. And during that tenure, Lee Harvey

24:10.220 --> 24:20.130
Oswald received his dishonorable discharge from 
the Marine Corps.

24:23.460 --> 24:37.140
And it has been publicized considerably that 
Oswald had written letters to John Connolly

24:37.120 --> 24:44.200
requesting that he, as Secretary of the Navy, 
review his case and consider an upgrade from

24:44.180 --> 24:54.230
dishonorable to something more desirable in the 
way of a discharge, and that Oswald was ignored by

24:54.810 --> 24:59.670
Connolly.

25:03.280 --> 25:13.240
During the summer and early fall, while all the 
publicity was going around saying,

25:13.220 --> 25:26.920
across the state, possibly across the country,

25:13.220 --> 25:26.920
pertaining to the visit of the President and Vice 
President and the Governor of these

25:26.900 --> 25:42.730
municipalities,

25:26.900 --> 25:42.730
Lee Harvey Oswald somehow, in spite of the 
reported sustenance of two homes, one in Fort

25:42.710 --> 25:52.900
Worth and one in Dallas, without being employed at 
all, managed to defray the expense of making a trip

25:52.880 --> 25:56.300
to Mexico City. And

25:56.280 --> 26:08.780
according to what has been published of the FBI 
report and the Warren report, Oswald crossed the

26:10.560 --> 26:17.260
Rio Grande River at a small village called Roma, 
Texas, which is the connecting bridge between

26:19.150 --> 26:30.720
Starr County, the county seat of which is Rio 
Grande City, and

26:30.700 --> 26:37.720
Old Mexico. This

26:37.860 --> 26:48.700
was also alleged to have been the route that he was 
traced in returning from Mexico City back to

26:37.860 --> 26:48.700
Dallas. It was reported by both the FBI and the 
Warren Commission that Oswald was traced to the

26:48.680 --> 26:59.080
Cuban consulate in Mexico City, as well as the 
Russian consulate, but did not hold any

27:00.000 --> 27:11.620
conversation, transact any business with anyone 
at either of these locations,

27:15.000 --> 27:15.801
returned to Mexico City. There

27:15.800 --> 27:31.630
has been no mention made of any investigation 
which would clarify whether or not Oswald

27:15.800 --> 27:31.630
contacted anybody North of the border of the Rio 
Grande, say in Starr County or Duval County, en

27:31.610 --> 27:41.570
route to Mexico City, in fact, by either the FBI or 
the Warren Commission. At

27:48.700 --> 27:56.373
the time, this was all going on in 1963.

27:59.539 --> 28:05.950
George Parr's nephew, Archer Parr, was county 
sheriff in Starr County. During

28:05.930 --> 28:36.830
this same period, Jack Ruby, the girly nightclub 
operator,

28:05.930 --> 28:36.830
for some mysterious reason, became exceedingly 
friendly with a lot of members of the Dallas Police

28:05.930 --> 28:36.830
Department, or at least this is what they and the 
FBI and the Warren Commission all concurred was

28:36.810 --> 28:46.190
fact. In my experience... In my experience as a 
municipal police officer, taught me long ago that

28:49.280 --> 29:08.420
this is highly unusual for people in that type of 
business

28:49.280 --> 29:08.420
to do anything regarding police except try to 
avoid it. Certainly not to be visiting the police

29:10.480 --> 29:17.220
station and getting well acquainted with the 
high-ranking officials and all this. It

29:17.760 --> 29:31.920
is my belief that

29:17.760 --> 29:31.920
Lee Harvey Oswald was a... He was awarded an 
opportunity by someone

29:32.100 --> 29:48.090
to have an opportunity to take revenge against 
John Connolly, not John Kennedy. There

29:48.070 --> 30:03.460
has been nothing to indicate there be any 
motivation whatsoever for Lee Harvey Oswald to

29:48.070 --> 30:03.460
want to kill John Kennedy. But there is sufficient 
motive in the ignoring of his plea. But there is

30:11.520 --> 30:37.620
sufficient motive in the ignoring of his plea for 
help pertaining to his dishonorable discharge

30:11.520 --> 30:37.620
from John Connolly to cause an individual with a 
temperament that the people who claim to know him

30:11.520 --> 30:37.620
said that Oswald had

30:11.520 --> 30:37.620
to try to assassinate John Connolly. And John 
Connolly was struck by some of the bullets that

30:37.600 --> 30:50.160
were fired into the car in which he and Kennedy were 
in. Can I ask you a question? Was the motorcade

30:54.770 --> 31:04.270
route that they traveled by the depository, was 
that pre-planned or was that a last-minute

30:54.770 --> 31:04.270
change? The chief police of the city of Dallas at 
that time wrote a book, which is easily available

31:05.850 --> 31:19.430
to anybody that wants it in almost any bookstore 
and certainly any library, stating

31:19.410 --> 31:40.600
that approximately 30 minutes before departure 
time for the motorcade with President Kennedy and

31:19.410 --> 31:40.600
Vice President Johnson and Governor John 
Connolly's

31:19.410 --> 31:40.600
wives had

31:40.580 --> 31:52.620
been changed around the motorcade, had been 
changed approximately 30 minutes prior to

31:40.580 --> 31:52.620
departure time so that it went by

31:52.600 --> 32:08.370
Book's storage building where Oswald was alleged 
to have shot the President and

32:08.350 --> 32:18.460
he was never able to determine who ordered this 
altering of the motorcade route. But

32:18.440 --> 32:30.380
the order did come and the route was changed so that 
the motorcade did pass by that building.

32:34.880 --> 32:46.180
Of course,

32:34.880 --> 32:46.180
I have not mentioned the motive of Jack Ruby for any 
part in the assassination. I

32:46.160 --> 33:08.280
have known many people of many religious 
organizations

32:46.160 --> 33:08.280
and I have rather consistently found that there is 
still a great deal of animosity between Baptists

33:08.260 --> 33:15.510
and Catholics and even more between Jews and 
Catholics. One

33:15.610 --> 33:45.850
man, era 1927, was rejected

33:15.610 --> 33:45.850
by the Democrats state who elected to support 
Herbert Clark Hoover much heavier than they did Al

33:15.610 --> 33:45.850
Smith in 1928 for the presidency of this country 
because Al Smith was Catholic and no other reason

33:45.830 --> 33:54.100
was ever given. And

33:54.080 --> 34:01.360
that was the only Republican that was elected. I am 
sorry, I am crazy. Thank you. Thank you very much.

34:03.220 --> 34:03.601
Thank you. ever supported a majority of the voters 
in the state of Texas for the presidency since the

34:03.621 --> 34:12.890
state of Texas has been in existence as a state.

34:21.325 --> 34:29.800
The next one that ever was was Richard Nixon

34:21.325 --> 34:29.800
and his

34:33.110 --> 34:41.815
margin was not nearly as great as Hoover's.

34:41.835 --> 34:47.070
Now the

34:41.835 --> 34:47.070
circumstances indicate to me that Jack Ruby was in 
on the conspiracy

34:47.050 --> 35:00.980
for the purpose of making sure that Lee Harvey 
Oswald did not tell authorities too much in the

35:00.960 --> 35:09.660
event he got caught and wasn't killed in the 
process of what transpired.

35:16.375 --> 35:24.840
And that

35:16.375 --> 35:24.840
is exactly what he did, and he became a common sight 
the Dallas police station so that he could gain

35:25.060 --> 35:36.460
access to Oswald sufficient to allow him to hush 
him up by taking his life. When the transfer on

35:40.114 --> 35:46.860
Sunday morning after the assassination from the 
Dallas City Police Station to the Dallas County

35:46.840 --> 35:59.090
Jail was attempted,

35:46.840 --> 35:59.090
millions of people who were watching the 
proceedings live on television from that

35:59.070 --> 36:08.080
location

35:59.070 --> 36:08.080
can attest to the fact that that is exactly what 
Jack Ruby did,

36:08.060 --> 36:20.430
and no one ever offered any motive for Jack Ruby's 
actions other than he just thought so much of the

36:20.410 --> 36:29.740
President of the United States that he decided to 
kill the man that was alleged to have killed him.

36:32.563 --> 36:33.410
But this does not end there. I want to explain why a 
strip joint operator prior to any assassination

36:33.450 --> 36:50.750
or any threat of it or anything else on the 
President got himself so familiarized around the

36:33.450 --> 36:50.750
Dallas Police Station that he could gain access to 
Oswald in the first place. Let's

36:50.730 --> 36:55.932
see how much tape we have left. Okay. Let's see. We 
have plenty of tape. Insofar

36:57.860 --> 37:10.150
as I have been able to determine what has been 
released in the way of even basic criminal

37:10.130 --> 37:30.440
investigative efforts on the part of either the 
FBI or the Warren Commission and the tracing of

37:10.130 --> 37:30.440
Oswald's

37:10.130 --> 37:30.440
movements to Mexico City and back,

37:32.490 --> 37:49.590
tracing the rifle which was alleged to have been 
the murder weapon

37:32.490 --> 37:49.590
and which was reportedly left behind in the book 
storage building, two leads to murder. Harvey

37:51.720 --> 38:04.940
Oswald

37:51.720 --> 38:04.940
and making ballistics tests and checking this 
weapon for fingerprints.

38:08.870 --> 38:18.970
Other elements of criminal investigation appear 
to me to be rather nil and no one ever did offer

38:21.840 --> 38:27.940
any true motivation on the part of Oswald having 
taken the line for the president or even

38:27.920 --> 38:32.340
attempting to lie to his own son. The only 
explanation that has ever been said that I've

38:32.320 --> 38:44.910
heard is the possible length of KGB because of his 
departure to Russia. What is your opinion of that?

38:46.890 --> 38:56.940
The belief was that Oswald appeared to be, from 
these accounts, Oswald was linked to the Russian

38:46.890 --> 38:56.940
KGB and this

38:56.920 --> 39:14.130
was supposed to have been determined by the CIA 
prior to what transpired in Dallas. But no tail was

39:14.110 --> 39:28.100
placed on Lee Harvey Oswald at that time to see what 
he was doing during this locate

39:14.110 --> 39:28.100
proceeding through the city of Dallas. Isn't it 
common, I mean isn't it common for anybody who has

39:28.080 --> 39:36.100
ever had anything to do with maybe even the threat 
that would lead to the president or would lead with

39:36.080 --> 39:46.790
suspected leads to the KGB to have secret 
servicemen around them or at least following

39:36.080 --> 39:46.790
them? That is not only applies to the president but 
all members of his family, the vice president and

39:46.770 --> 39:56.790
all members of his family. And any serious 
candidate for the presidency at all. This is

40:05.050 --> 40:15.070
besides the bodyguards of the candidate or the 
president themselves but they do also, any person

40:05.050 --> 40:15.070
that they believe will threaten him. Isn't it 
usual that they will go and that they will watch

40:15.050 --> 40:19.070
that person? It is my understanding that 
especially that during a time when there is a, when

40:19.050 --> 40:33.810
the president or any member of his family is known 
to be in the proximity of the president. in the

40:33.790 --> 40:46.040
proximity of any individual who might be believed 
to be a foreign agent, a spy, would certainly be

40:48.560 --> 40:53.660
placed under very close surveillance, at least 
during that time. It would be a special effort to

40:55.420 --> 41:00.990
keep them under closer than normal surveillance 
by the FBI, CIA, Secret Service, all. But

41:04.270 --> 41:21.740
I noticed that after

41:04.270 --> 41:21.740
Lyndon Johnson was deceased,

41:24.840 --> 41:32.470
George Parr got tangled up in another theft 
business case, tried to find the family guilty

41:32.930 --> 41:39.870
again, and assessed prison terms. What was this 
other case, can you say? This other case after

41:43.510 --> 41:47.730
Lyndon Johnson's death, what was this other case? 
I believe it was... something pertaining to the

41:50.330 --> 41:58.240
county treasury funds in Duval County. At any 
rate, they found him dead where he, according to

42:00.240 --> 42:07.800
the investigation that followed that, the victim 
of suicide, since there was no way of getting

42:08.240 --> 42:13.940
another presidential pardon because Johnson was 
no longer around. There

42:18.510 --> 42:25.030
wasn't anybody to prevail upon any president then 
to give him a pardon. It's

42:27.780 --> 42:32.614
suicide. It further convinces me that Johnson was 
the engineer in the two presidential pardons that

42:34.099 --> 42:41.380
he did get. Were

42:41.360 --> 42:51.410
you ever a patrolman in Starr County yourself? 
Have I ever been there? Have you ever been a

42:53.390 --> 42:57.410
patrolman in Starr County? I've never been a 
patrolman there, I was a soldier there. Okay, you

43:00.390 --> 43:02.410
were a soldier there. At the time that Rigby 
Clifton had gone to Mexico, is there any knowledge

43:05.830 --> 43:12.060
of him having stopped before he had crossed the 
border? I have never heard anything pertaining to

43:12.040 --> 43:16.060
that whatsoever. I know nothing stipulated that 
any effort was made on the part of the FBI or the

43:16.040 --> 43:26.070
Warren Commission, either one, to see if he did 
actually stop in Rio Grande City or figure off

43:30.050 --> 43:35.070
through Duval County or some other place and make 
any contact with anybody. There's never been any.

43:36.650 --> 43:41.180
There's never been anything published saying 
that he did, and nothing published saying that he

43:41.160 --> 43:45.320
didn't. But there was certainly every 
opportunity in the world for him to have done so,

43:50.300 --> 43:55.400
because he had to go directly through Rio Grande 
City. And wasn't that the only bridge, the only

43:55.380 --> 44:03.400
access to Mexico through that route at that time? 
That is the, between, I believe. Well, it is. It was

44:08.820 --> 44:19.060
then, and I think still is, the next place west or 
northwest on the Rio Grande that you could cross on

44:19.040 --> 44:26.140
a bridge after you leave Reynosa. I

44:26.120 --> 44:36.140
think there was another bridge until you got to 
Roma at that time. And only one highway ran right

44:36.120 --> 44:40.490
through the middle of town, and the railroad track 
ran parallel to it up to Rio Grande City. And there,

44:45.650 --> 44:54.260
there was a Y formed in the track so that the engines 
could turn around and come to the other end of the

44:54.240 --> 44:58.260
train and go back to Mission. Having

45:00.240 --> 45:08.340
been stationed at Fort Ringgold, which was an army 
post for the United States Cavalry, 1st Cavalry

45:13.700 --> 45:20.610
Division, from August the 7th in 1940 around the 
middle of February of 1941, I had an occasion to

45:26.370 --> 45:37.180
find out that that was the only road through

45:26.370 --> 45:37.180
that. You've said, and I want to get it down, that 
what is your belief that why Johnson would accept

45:40.160 --> 45:49.550
the nomination for Vice President? Was it an 
ulterior motive, or why would Kennedy? It

45:53.530 --> 45:56.550
appeared to me that, that since Johnson already 
held the position of Senate Majority Leader,

46:02.530 --> 46:07.550
which was much more powerful and prestigious than 
that of Vice President, and second only to the

46:07.530 --> 46:12.430
President

46:07.530 --> 46:12.430
himself, that Johnson's only hope to ever be 
President, which he was seeking to be

46:18.580 --> 46:28.550
in the 1960 Democratic Convention,

46:28.530 --> 46:31.890
and made no bones about it, that his only chance 
would be to become Vice President, and then the

46:36.870 --> 46:41.580
President whom he was serving with, a deceased 
officer, become incapable of carrying on the

46:44.160 --> 46:51.700
duties of President. It might also be noted that 
Judge Cyril T. Hughes was a federal judge who swore

46:57.680 --> 47:03.140
in Johnson as President aboard the Air Force One in 
Dallas, Texas. Some, according to the news media,

47:11.860 --> 47:18.660
30 minutes after the

47:11.860 --> 47:18.660
President had been pronounced dead, and that she 
was

47:18.640 --> 47:29.370
suggested, so the story goes, by Johnson to be 
nominated for the federal

47:31.850 --> 47:43.560
judgeship by the President. Okay.

47:47.356 --> 47:50.830
Is it your belief that without Johnson's support 
in Texas, Kennedy could have carried Texas? I

47:52.810 --> 48:01.540
always figured that because he was a Catholic, 
more than anything else, a great Baptist belt runs

48:04.690 --> 48:07.710
through the heart of Texas and spreads almost to 
the borders in both directions, that he would have

48:13.510 --> 48:18.530
not had much better luck than Al Smith did. Al

48:18.510 --> 48:27.760
Smith did not have a run in Texas. Now

48:27.740 --> 48:39.230
I want it to be known that this is my analysis of this 
case, what I've been able to learn about it, what

48:42.210 --> 48:48.990
has been published and printed by the news media, 
and what has been released by the Warren

48:48.970 --> 48:53.430
Commission.
