WEBVTT

00:03.085 --> 00:04.547
Mic test 1, 2, 3. Mic test 1, 2, 3. I'm in the process 
of conducting an interview with somebody dealing

00:06.049 --> 00:13.019
with the assassination of John F. Kennedy. My name 
is Eugene Sepulveda. Today is March the 12th,

00:14.441 --> 00:17.626
1980. This is another volume test, just another 
volume. Okay, but were you in the rank of a

00:24.095 --> 00:29.467
detective or were you in the rank of a policeman? 
Eight years as a detective, ten years as a

00:29.708 --> 00:35.100
lieutenant detective.

00:42.016 --> 00:42.797
OK. So could I have this again? If this is correct, 
please correct me. Name's John B. Evans. You're 33

00:51.127 --> 00:56.514
and a half years of the policeman, eight years as a 
detective, and two years as a lieutenant

00:51.127 --> 00:56.514
detective. Is that correct? OK. All in criminal 
investigation bureau,

00:58.256 --> 01:06.025
they call it. All right. Can you just kind of start 
off like we started talking yesterday? Yeah. Have

01:12.970 --> 01:16.295
you got that thing on? Yeah.

01:19.620 --> 01:21.283
Okay. My name is John B. Evans. I am 64 years of age. 
I've been born in 1916.

01:33.362 --> 01:39.411
And I predicate what I am about to say

01:33.362 --> 01:39.411
on the experience in the field of criminal 
investigation

01:40.910 --> 01:58.109
which had a tenure of in excess of 33 years in the 
fifth largest city in the United States. Which

01:58.129 --> 01:58.810
was? Houston, Texas.

02:04.616 --> 02:10.242
Let me say that in my experience I have found

02:12.449 --> 02:41.916
from the institution of the criminal 
investigation all the way through the courts that

02:12.449 --> 02:41.916
a necessary item for any human being old enough to 
answer for his or her acts

02:12.449 --> 02:41.916
must be that they would be sane at the time of the 
commission of the act

02:44.157 --> 02:57.235
and aware of the consequences in the event that 
prosecution resulted as a punishment for such

02:44.157 --> 02:57.235
acts. And the only exception

02:57.255 --> 03:07.228
for adult sane human beings

03:11.191 --> 03:20.802
or adult beings would have to be insanity, for 
which they could not be prosecuted because of

03:11.191 --> 03:20.802
their condition. They have no control over their 
acts or are not conscious of what their acts might

03:20.822 --> 03:27.790
result in.

03:32.235 --> 03:35.899
From the time that the assassination of John 
Fitzgerald Kennedy, President of the United

03:37.398 --> 04:04.738
States of America in 1963

03:37.398 --> 04:04.738
occurred in Dallas, Texas, I have had a theory from 
a criminal investigation that

03:37.398 --> 04:04.738
certain individuals had certain motives

04:06.035 --> 04:13.485
which led to this assassination.

04:16.849 --> 04:31.889
And I will begin with the individual whom I 
consider to have the prime motive of personal gain

04:16.849 --> 04:31.889
and prestige

04:16.849 --> 04:31.889
as a result of this incident. And that would be At 
that time, Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson,

04:35.836 --> 05:05.337
whose motive

04:35.836 --> 05:05.337
for personal gain and power and prestige would 
have been Presidency of the United States, as it

04:35.836 --> 05:05.337
was incumbent upon the Vice President, in the 
event a President deceases while in office, to

05:06.869 --> 05:15.421
assume the office of the President of the United 
States.

05:15.441 --> 05:35.830
From observation

05:15.441 --> 05:35.830
of incidents a number of years prior to the 
assassination concerning Mr. Johnson and some

05:15.441 --> 05:35.830
other individuals and additional individuals 
after the fact, of the assassination. Leads me to

05:40.302 --> 06:03.994
suspect and I firmly believe that the other 
individuals involved in that case were George

05:40.302 --> 06:03.994
Parr, who was the

05:40.302 --> 06:03.994
alleged kingpin of politics in South Texas, 
namely Duval and Starr counties,

06:05.493 --> 06:33.508
Lee Harvey Oswald, who was a former United States 
Marine and who, reliable information tells me,

06:05.493 --> 06:33.508
had received a dishonorable discharge from that 
arm of the military service,

06:33.809 --> 07:02.196
and Jack Ruby, who operated a series of

06:33.809 --> 07:02.196
questionable

06:33.809 --> 07:02.196
business establishments referred to ordinarily 
as striptease joints in Dallas, Texas.

07:03.442 --> 07:24.904
applying the basic rules of criminal 
investigation wherein a motive is a necessary

07:03.442 --> 07:24.904
item

07:03.442 --> 07:24.904
when you reach the prosecution stage in any case

07:03.442 --> 07:24.904
to obtain a conviction.

07:24.924 --> 07:32.672
The

07:24.924 --> 07:32.672
afore stated George Parr who was renowned to be a 
very close friend to the aforesaid Lyndon Baines

07:33.935 --> 08:02.811
Johnson over a long period of years,

07:33.935 --> 08:02.811
was alleged by various investigative 
organizations, including the Federal Bureau of

07:33.935 --> 08:02.811
Investigation and other private citizens,

07:33.935 --> 08:02.811
to have arranged so that at an election in a contest 
for a state senatorship between Lyndon Baines

08:04.799 --> 08:29.608
Johnson and Koch R. Stevenson,

08:04.799 --> 08:29.608
rather early in Johnson's career as a politician,

08:36.102 --> 09:05.417
that George Carr had arranged

08:36.102 --> 09:05.417
for the election returns to be reported to the 
election central in Dallas, Texas

08:36.102 --> 09:05.417
after an election had been held on a Saturday until 
sometime the following Wednesday, by which time

09:07.051 --> 09:29.817
the most of the votes which had been reported in the 
balance of the state had had time to be fairly well

09:07.051 --> 09:29.817
canvassed before allowing the vote from Duval 
County to be reported to the election central in

09:07.051 --> 09:29.817
Dallas. And prior to the reporting of Duval County 
vote,

09:39.316 --> 09:57.420
Colt Stevenson had a slight lead in the race over 
Lyndon Johnson, but Johnson would not concede the

09:39.316 --> 09:57.420
election until all of the boxers in the state were 
heard from, and that included Duval County. After

09:57.440 --> 10:09.036
the votes were finally called in or reported by 
mail or whatever means they were reported from

09:57.440 --> 10:09.036
Duval County, Lyndon Johnson showed to have the 
89-vote lead in the race for the Senator's job in

10:10.855 --> 10:26.197
the statewide election.

10:26.217 --> 10:36.913
And at that time, Colt Stevenson conceded the 
election to Lyndon Baines Johnson, and Johnson

10:26.217 --> 10:36.913
became a Senator of the state of Texas.

10:40.842 --> 11:08.031
Some years later,

10:40.842 --> 11:08.031
during the administration of Harry S. Truman as 
President of the United States, it came to pass,

10:40.842 --> 11:08.031
according to the news media's reports

10:40.842 --> 11:08.031
concerning George Parr, that George Parr had been

11:11.116 --> 11:35.725
federal court on income tax evasion or 
falsification of his income tax report, and uh,

11:11.116 --> 11:35.725
summarily tried and found guilty and assessed a 
penalty of ten years in federal prison.

11:35.745 --> 11:39.790
But after the jury had found par guilty, put the 
case on appeal, and sometime later received a

11:40.630 --> 12:01.272
presidential pardon from Harry S. Truman.

12:01.773 --> 12:06.418
Harry Truman hailed from the state of Missouri. 
And no mention has ever been made publicly by

12:07.478 --> 12:19.436
anyone that Harry Truman and George Carr had ever 
heard of each other, much less know each other. So I

12:22.221 --> 12:28.390
presume that the case was that they were strangers 
to each other, unknowns to each other. Okay, can I

12:29.382 --> 12:32.346
stop you for a minute for a voice check? Sure. We're 
now resuming. I'll just take a voice check and

12:34.308 --> 12:36.891
we're going to continue. Yeah,

12:36.911 --> 12:41.037
that's perfect. Now that

12:43.019 --> 12:55.575
Lyndon Johnson was no longer in debt to George 
Parr,

12:43.019 --> 12:55.575
or the... ballot box packing, or stuffing, which 
obtained him the senator's job, according to

12:57.597 --> 13:12.991
reports

12:57.597 --> 13:12.991
from the FBI and various citizens.

13:16.474 --> 13:26.963
The contrary now held true that Parr

13:16.474 --> 13:26.963
was indebted to Johnson for 10 years of his life.

13:31.297 --> 14:01.135
In later years,

13:31.297 --> 14:01.135
after Johnson had

13:31.297 --> 14:01.135
worked his way up to Senate Majority Leader in the 
Senate,

13:31.297 --> 14:01.135
and the presidential election was to come about in 
the year of 1960, and the Democratic was held at San

14:01.351 --> 14:25.401
Francisco, California, wherein Johnson seeked 
the nomination of the Democratic Party to run for

14:01.351 --> 14:25.401
president

14:01.351 --> 14:25.401
against Richard Milhous Nixon, who the 
Republicans had nominated as their candidate.

14:29.093 --> 14:43.953
Johnson failed to get the nomination and the 
nomination was given to John Fitzgerald Kennedy

14:29.093 --> 14:43.953
of Massachusetts.

14:43.973 --> 14:49.600
And the

14:43.973 --> 14:49.600
feeling of the party was that the state of Texas 
would be a necessary item of support in order for

14:50.272 --> 15:00.383
Kennedy to win the election. And therefore, the 
position of candidacy for the vice presidency

15:02.625 --> 15:16.060
was submitted to Johnson and he accepted it.

15:21.929 --> 15:47.920
In 1958, I believe,

15:21.929 --> 15:47.920
Mr. George Parr, who still politically ruled 
Duval County,

15:21.929 --> 15:47.920
managed to get his hands on some of the county's 
school funds.

15:50.667 --> 16:16.101
and was indicted by a state grand jury, tried in 
state district court, and found guilty of felony

15:50.667 --> 16:16.101
theft of school funds, assessed the then maximum 
penalty for felony theft in the first defense of 10

15:50.667 --> 16:16.101
years to be served in what was then known as the 
TSPS, Texas State Prison

16:18.292 --> 16:24.398
System. This case was put on appeal, and Parr 
remained free on appeal bond

16:24.419 --> 16:43.759
as the case wound its way through the Court of 
Criminal Appeals and would have ultimately gone

16:24.419 --> 16:43.759
to the state Supreme Court.

16:48.262 --> 17:11.713
During the interim, the 1960 election, the 
President of the United States occurred, and John

16:48.262 --> 17:11.713
Fitzgerald Kennedy was elected President, and 
Lyndon Baines Johnson Vice President of the

16:48.262 --> 17:11.713
United States.

17:11.733 --> 17:15.838
To the best of my recollection of what occurred,

17:18.097 --> 17:29.997
The inauguration of Kennedy and Johnson was on or 
about the 12th of January, 1961.

17:33.382 --> 17:41.556
And sometime

17:33.382 --> 17:41.556
between the middle and the end of March that same 
year,

17:43.443 --> 17:50.110
George Parr received presidential pardon from 
John Fitzgerald Kennedy for his felony theft.

17:56.678 --> 18:10.733
All of these matters would of necessity appear in 
the official records of the government of the

17:56.678 --> 18:10.733
United States and the state of Texas, official 
court records and so forth.

18:14.138 --> 18:21.746
pertaining to these convictions and pardons.

18:21.826 --> 18:40.045
Time proceeded on, and during the summer of 1963, 
the

18:21.826 --> 18:40.045
Democrat Party in the state of Texas became split 
into several different factions.

18:42.134 --> 18:45.618
I believe there was about seven, all told.

18:48.141 --> 19:10.808
And

18:48.141 --> 19:10.808
Lyndon Johnson, because the year of 1964 was to be a 
presidential election year again,

18:48.141 --> 19:10.808
and it was reported in the news media that he had had

18:48.141 --> 19:10.808
a talk with President Kennedy and at that time, 
Governor John B. Conley, governor of the state of

19:11.243 --> 19:37.082
Texas, to the effect that he and Johnson and the 
president should come to Texas on what he termed a

19:11.243 --> 19:37.082
fence-mending tour in order to get the

19:11.243 --> 19:37.082
Democrat Party all back into one corral. These 
terms are used among Texas ranchers pertaining to

19:38.868 --> 19:56.385
cattle, but Texas politicians use the same 
terminology pertaining to voters.

19:56.405 --> 20:06.394
And at first, because of some incidents which had 
occurred in Dallas, Texas,

19:56.405 --> 20:06.394
when Adlai E. Stevenson, Sr., a senator from the 
state of Illinois, and a retired general named

20:06.762 --> 20:29.269
Walker, who lived in Dallas, Texas,

20:06.762 --> 20:29.269
and several other rather prominent national 
figures. The Democratic Party had attempted to

20:29.289 --> 20:35.537
make speeches in Dallas, Texas, they received 
vegetables and eggs some sticks and stones

20:35.939 --> 20:59.078
directed at the speakers

20:35.939 --> 20:59.078
instead of any applause or exception of their 
speech

20:35.939 --> 20:59.078
also uh Well, publicized at the time, General 
Walker had sustained a bullet hole in the picture

20:59.935 --> 21:15.480
window of his living room in his home in Dallas, 
Texas, and sustained a near miss from the bullet

20:59.935 --> 21:15.480
that put the hole there.

21:19.882 --> 21:32.237
so that it was published

21:19.882 --> 21:32.237
by the news media, newspapers, radio and 
television. John Connolly had advised against

21:34.512 --> 21:57.718
the President and the Vice President both coming 
to Texas at the same time together going to various

21:34.512 --> 21:57.718
municipalities in the state on this fence mending 
tour because it was dangerous and especially the

21:34.512 --> 21:57.718
attitude of the people in Dallas, Texas.

21:59.538 --> 22:20.717
But somehow Johnson, according to reports in the 
news media, persuaded the President and Governor

21:59.538 --> 22:20.717
Connolly that he and the President would not 
receive any such treatment even in Dallas.

22:24.180 --> 22:27.823
So they decided to come to Dallas. And immediately 
the news media began to publish stories about the

22:28.428 --> 22:48.798
anticipated visit of the president and the vice 
president, detailing when they would be in each

22:28.428 --> 22:48.798
municipality that they were to visit.

22:48.818 --> 22:54.486
And publishing in the newspapers prominently 
displayed on the front pages the planned

22:56.238 --> 23:07.710
motorcade route that they would follow through 
each of these municipalities as they progressed

22:56.238 --> 23:07.710
on their visitation. These diagrams were also 
displayed on television quite frequently in each

23:07.730 --> 23:14.476
of these cities.

23:17.660 --> 23:23.005
And so that it would be common knowledge to the 
people who might want to have a chance to see their

23:23.272 --> 23:44.036
president and vice president and their governor 
all simultaneously

23:23.272 --> 23:44.036
be able to position themselves along these 
motorcade routes for that purpose.

23:44.056 --> 23:44.537
Now,

23:49.613 --> 24:08.439
Prior to becoming governor of the state of Texas, 
John B. Connolly served at the cabinet level

23:49.613 --> 24:08.439
in Washington, D.C. in the capacity of Secretary 
of the Navy. And during that tenure, Lee Harvey

24:10.381 --> 24:16.650
Oswald received his dishonorable discharge from 
the Marine Corps.

24:23.805 --> 24:44.308
And it has been publicized considerably that 
Oswald had written letters to John Connolly

24:23.805 --> 24:44.308
requesting that he as Secretary of the Navy review 
his case and consider an upgrade from

24:45.993 --> 25:03.414
dishonorable to something more desirable in the 
way of a discharge, and that Oswald was ignored by

24:45.993 --> 25:03.414
Connolly.

25:03.434 --> 25:14.447
During the summer and early fall, while all the 
publicity was going around to the news media,

25:17.279 --> 25:20.403
across the state, possibly across the country.

25:23.788 --> 25:45.379
Pertaining to the visit of the president and vice 
president and the governor of these

25:23.788 --> 25:45.379
municipalities,

25:23.788 --> 25:45.379
Lee Harvey Oswald somehow, in spite of the 
reported sustenance of two homes, one in Fort

25:23.788 --> 25:45.379
Worth and one in Dallas, without being employed at 
all, managed to defray the expense of making a trip

25:47.114 --> 26:01.988
to Mexico City.

26:02.008 --> 26:16.362
And according to what has been published of the FBI 
report and the Warren report, Oswald crossed the

26:02.008 --> 26:16.362
Rio Grande River at a small village called Roma 
which

26:16.865 --> 26:38.299
is the connecting bridge between Starr County, 
the county seat of which is Rio Grande City,

26:16.865 --> 26:38.299
and

26:16.865 --> 26:38.299
Old Mexico.

26:41.738 --> 26:48.706
This was also alleged to have been the route that he 
was traced in returning from Mexico City back to

26:41.738 --> 26:48.706
Dallas. It was reported by both the FBI and the 
Warren Commission that Oswald was traced to the

26:50.969 --> 27:09.771
Cuban consulate in Mexico City as well as the 
Russian consulate, but did not hold any

26:50.969 --> 27:09.771
conversation, transact any business with anyone 
at either of these locations

27:10.072 --> 27:19.865
and return to Dallas, Texas. There has been no 
mention made of any investigation which would

27:19.886 --> 27:39.893
clarify whether or not Oswald contacted anybody 
north of the border of Rio Grande, say in Starr

27:19.886 --> 27:39.893
County or Duval County, en route to Mexico City is 
backed

27:40.885 --> 27:48.654
by either the FBI or the Warren Commission.

27:52.459 --> 28:06.235
At the time this was all going on in 1963,

27:52.459 --> 28:06.235
George Parr's nephew, Archer Parr, was county 
sheriff in Starr County.

28:12.661 --> 28:40.491
During this same period, Jack Ruby, the girly 
nightclub operator,

28:12.661 --> 28:40.491
for some mysterious reason, became exceedingly 
friendly with a lot of members of the Dallas Police

28:12.661 --> 28:40.491
Department, or at least this is what they and the 
The FBI and the Warren Commission all concur. It's

28:45.618 --> 28:46.239
a fact. And my experience as a municipal police 
officer taught me long ago that this is highly

28:48.803 --> 29:08.335
unusual for people in that type of business to do 
anything regarding police except try to avoid it.

29:10.542 --> 29:21.616
certainly not to be visiting the police station 
and getting well acquainted with the high ranking

29:10.542 --> 29:21.616
officials and all this.

29:21.636 --> 29:38.997
Now,

29:21.636 --> 29:38.997
it is my belief that

29:21.636 --> 29:38.997
Lee Harvey Oswald was afforded an opportunity by 
someone

29:21.636 --> 29:38.997
to have an opportunity to take revenge against 
John Connolly, not John Kennedy.

29:51.236 --> 30:03.571
There has been nothing to indicate there be any 
motivation whatsoever for Lee Harvey Oswald to

29:51.236 --> 30:03.571
want to kill John Kennedy. But there is sufficient 
in the ignoring of his plea for help pertaining to

30:08.356 --> 30:37.755
his dishonorable discharge from John Connolly to 
cause an individual with a temperament that the

30:08.356 --> 30:37.755
people who claimed to know him said that Oswald had

30:08.356 --> 30:37.755
to try to assassinate John Connolly. And John 
Connolly was struck by some of the bullets that

30:40.199 --> 30:51.152
were fired into the car in which he and Kennedy were 
riding. Can I ask you a question? Was the motorcade

30:55.217 --> 31:04.288
route that they traveled by the depository, was 
that pre-planned or was that a last-minute

30:55.217 --> 31:04.288
change? The... Chief police of the city of Dallas 
at that time wrote a book, which is easily

31:07.317 --> 31:35.586
available to anybody that wants it in almost any 
bookstore and certainly any library,

31:07.317 --> 31:35.586
stating that approximately 30 minutes before 
departure time for the motorcade with President

31:07.317 --> 31:35.586
Kennedy and Vice President Johnson Governor John 
Connolly and their wives

31:36.511 --> 32:02.670
had been changed around the locate, had been 
changed approximately 30 minutes prior to

31:36.511 --> 32:02.670
departure time so that it went by the book storage 
building where Oswald was alleged to have shot the

32:03.241 --> 32:11.811
president.

32:11.831 --> 32:18.459
And he was never able to determine who ordered this 
altering of the motorcade route.

32:21.682 --> 32:30.733
But the order did come and the route was changed so 
that the motorcade did pass by that building.

32:34.932 --> 33:04.163
course

32:34.932 --> 33:04.163
I have not mentioned the motive of Jack Ruby for any 
part in the assassination

32:34.932 --> 33:04.163
but I have known many people of many religious 
organizations

32:34.932 --> 33:04.163
and I have rather consistently found that there is 
a still a great deal of animosity between Baptists

33:06.218 --> 33:19.610
and Catholics and even more between Jews and 
Catholics.

33:19.630 --> 33:33.103
And Al Smith was rejected

33:19.630 --> 33:33.103
by a Democrat state who elected to support Herbert 
Clark Hoover much heavier than they did Al Smith in

33:34.028 --> 33:53.958
1928 for the presidency of this country because Al 
Smith was Catholic and no other reason was ever

33:34.028 --> 33:53.958
given.

33:57.883 --> 34:03.732
And that was the only Republican that was ever 
supported the majority of the voters in the state

34:04.049 --> 34:21.337
of Texas for the presidency since the state of 
Texas has been in existence as a state.

34:21.357 --> 34:30.512
The next one that ever was was Richard Nixon

34:21.357 --> 34:30.512
and his

34:32.973 --> 34:35.998
margin was not nearly as great as Hoover's.

34:41.807 --> 35:01.697
Now the circumstances indicate to me that Jack 
Ruby was in on the conspiracy

34:41.807 --> 35:01.697
for the purpose of making sure that Lee Harvey 
Oswald did not tell authorities too much in the

35:02.825 --> 35:12.437
event he got caught and wasn't killed in the 
process of what transpired.

35:16.382 --> 35:21.468
And

35:16.382 --> 35:21.468
that is exactly what he did. And he became a common 
sight around the Dallas police station so that he

35:22.409 --> 35:31.600
could gain access to Oswald sufficient to allow 
him to hush him up by taking his life. And when the

35:40.029 --> 35:54.837
transfer on the Sunday morning after the 
assassination from the Dallas City Police

35:40.029 --> 35:54.837
Station to the Dallas County Jail was attempted 
Millions of people who were watching the

35:57.314 --> 36:11.851
proceedings live on television from that 
location

35:57.314 --> 36:11.851
can attest to the fact that that is exactly what 
Jack Ruby did.

36:14.554 --> 36:27.068
And no one ever offered any motive for Jack Ruby's 
actions other than that he just thought so much of

36:14.554 --> 36:27.068
the President of the United States that he decided 
to kill the man that was alleged to have killed us.

36:32.551 --> 36:54.202
But this does not explain why a strip joint 
operator prior to any assassination or any threat

36:32.551 --> 36:54.202
of it or anything else on the president got himself 
so familiarized around the Dallas police station

36:32.551 --> 36:54.202
that he could gain access to Oswald in the first

36:32.551 --> 36:54.202
place. I want to see how much tape we have left. OK. 
Let's see. We have plenty of tape. Insofar as I have

37:00.578 --> 37:30.079
been able to determine what has been released in 
the way of even basic criminal investigative

37:00.578 --> 37:30.079
efforts on the part of either the FBI or the Warren 
Commission in the tracing of Oswald's

37:00.578 --> 37:30.079
movements to Mexico City and back, and tracing the 
rifle which was alleged to have been the murder

37:32.438 --> 38:01.062
weapon

37:32.438 --> 38:01.062
and which was reportedly left behind in the 
bookstore's building to Lee Harvey Oswald

37:32.438 --> 38:01.062
and making ballistics tests and checking this 
weapon for fingerprints.

38:09.071 --> 38:31.453
Other elements of criminal investigation appear 
to me to be rather nil, and no one ever did offer

38:09.071 --> 38:31.453
any true motivation on the part of Oswald having 
taken the line for the president, or even

38:09.071 --> 38:31.453
attempting the line for John Connors. The only 
explanation that has ever been said that I've

38:32.108 --> 38:44.481
heard is the possible links of KGB because of his 
departure to Russia. And what is your opinion of

38:44.501 --> 38:46.002
that? The belief was that Oswald appeared to be, 
that Oswald, from these accounts, that Oswald was

38:46.022 --> 38:59.736
linked to the Russian KGB and

39:03.580 --> 39:28.175
This was supposed to have been determined by the 
CIA prior to what transpired in Dallas, but no tail

39:03.580 --> 39:28.175
was placed on Lee Harvey Oswald at that time to see 
what he was doing during this locate proceeding

39:03.580 --> 39:28.175
through the city of Dallas. Isn't it common I mean, 
isn't it common for anybody who has ever had

39:30.023 --> 39:48.448
anything to do with maybe even a threat to the 
president or with leaks, with suspected leaks to

39:30.023 --> 39:48.448
the KGB to have secret servicemen around them or at 
least following them? That is, uh, not only

39:48.468 --> 39:56.099
applies to the president, but all members of his 
family, the vice president and all members of his

39:48.468 --> 39:56.099
family. But I'm... And any... any serious 
candidate for the presidency at all. This is

40:04.362 --> 40:19.960
besides the bodyguards of the candidate or the 
president themselves, but they do also, any

40:04.362 --> 40:19.960
person that they believe will threaten it, isn't 
it usual that they will go and that they will watch

40:04.362 --> 40:19.960
that person? It is my understanding that 
especially that during a time when there is a when

40:27.668 --> 40:53.845
the president or any member of his family is known 
to be in the proximity of any individual who might

40:27.668 --> 40:53.845
be believed to be a foreign agent, a spy,

40:27.668 --> 40:53.845
would certainly be placed under very close 
surveillance, at least during that time. be a

40:55.462 --> 41:09.876
special effort to keep them under closer than 
normal surveillance by FBI, CIA, Secret Service,

40:55.462 --> 41:09.876
all.

41:09.896 --> 41:21.908
But I

41:09.896 --> 41:21.908
noticed that after

41:09.896 --> 41:21.908
Lyndon Johnson was deceased,

41:24.942 --> 41:54.240
george parr got tangled up in another theft 
business with case and was tried and found that

41:24.942 --> 41:54.240
found guilty again and assessed prison term what 
was this what was this other case can you say this

41:24.942 --> 41:54.240
other case after linda johnson's death what was 
this other case what was the i believe it was uh

41:24.942 --> 41:54.240
something pertaining to the county treasury 
funds in duval county at any rate they found him

41:55.688 --> 42:18.422
dead where he according to the investigation 
followed that victim of suicide since there was no

41:55.688 --> 42:18.422
way of getting another presidential pardon 
because johnson was no longer around

42:21.423 --> 42:28.596
anybody to prevail upon any president then to give

42:21.423 --> 42:28.596
him a pardon.

42:32.082 --> 42:34.026
It's suicide. This further convinces me that 
Johnson was engineering the two presidential

42:34.046 --> 42:41.980
pardons that he didn't get.

42:45.520 --> 42:51.748
Were you ever a patrolman in Starr County 
yourself? Have I ever been there? Have you ever

42:55.173 --> 42:58.057
been a patrolman in Starr County? Never been a 
patrolman there. I was a soldier there. Okay, you

43:00.841 --> 43:02.122
were a soldier there. At the time that Ruby Clifton 
had gone to Mexico, is there any knowledge of him

43:02.142 --> 43:10.093
having stopped? I have never heard anything 
pertaining to that whatsoever.

43:19.997 --> 43:37.684
Nothing stipulated that any effort was made on the 
part of the FBI or the Warren Commission, either

43:19.997 --> 43:37.684
one, to see if he did actually stop in Rio Grande 
City or veer off through New Ball County or some

43:19.997 --> 43:37.684
other place and make any contact

43:19.997 --> 43:37.684
with anybody. anything published saying that he 
did, and nothing published saying that he didn't.

43:45.530 --> 43:55.403
But there was certainly every opportunity in the 
world for him to have done so, because he was, had to

43:45.530 --> 43:55.403
go directly through Rio Grande City. And wasn't 
that the only, it wasn't that the only, the only

43:55.824 --> 44:03.935
bridge, the only access to Mexico through that 
route at that time? That is the, between, I

44:03.995 --> 44:08.160
believe, Well, it was then, and I think still is, 
the next place west or northwest on the Rio Grande

44:08.984 --> 44:29.189
that you could cross on a bridge after you leave 
Reynosa.

44:29.209 --> 44:32.773
McAllen and Reynosa.

44:32.793 --> 44:36.217
I don't think there was another bridge until you 
got to Roma at that time. And only one highway

44:36.558 --> 44:38.620
was... ran right through the middle of town, and 
the railroad track ran parallel to it up to Rio

44:39.629 --> 44:46.737
Grande City. And there, there was a Y formed in the 
track so that the engine could turn around and go on

44:48.499 --> 44:59.931
the other end of the train and go back to Mission.

45:04.936 --> 45:09.501
And having been stationed at Fort Ringgold, which 
was an Army post for the United States Cavalry, 1st

45:10.780 --> 45:17.309
Cavalry Division. From August the 7th in 1940 to 
around the middle of February in 1941,

45:17.329 --> 45:37.037
I had an occasion to find out that that was the only 
road through

45:17.329 --> 45:37.037
there. You've said And I want to get it down. What is 
your belief that why Johnson would accept the

45:41.029 --> 45:47.100
nomination for vice president? Was it an ulterior 
motive? Or why would Kennedy? It would appear to me

45:53.571 --> 46:02.607
that since Johnson already held the position of 
Senate Majority Leader, which was much more

46:03.143 --> 46:30.062
powerful and prestigious than that of Vice 
President and second only to the President

46:03.143 --> 46:30.062
himself,

46:03.143 --> 46:30.062
that Johnson's only hope to ever be President, 
which he was seeking to be at the 1960 Democratic

46:03.143 --> 46:30.062
Convention,

46:03.143 --> 46:30.062
and made no bones about it, that his only chance 
would be to become vice president and then the

46:32.185 --> 46:52.003
president, whom he was serving with, would have 
deceased and officer would have become incapable

46:32.185 --> 46:52.003
of carrying on the duties of president.

46:52.023 --> 47:01.652
It might also be noted that Judge Cyril T. Hughes 
was a federal judge who for Ann Johnson as

47:02.088 --> 47:08.014
president aboard Air Force One in Dallas, Texas. 
Some, according to the news media, 30 minutes

47:10.157 --> 47:29.597
after

47:10.157 --> 47:29.597
the president had been pronounced dead,

47:10.157 --> 47:29.597
and that she was

47:10.157 --> 47:29.597
suggested so the story goes, by Johnson to be 
nominated for the federal judgeship by the

47:30.944 --> 47:39.695
president. And she was appointed and was 
confirmed to the Senate. Okay. Is it you believe

47:47.885 --> 47:55.015
that without Johnson's support in Texas, Kennedy 
could have carried Texas? I always figured that

47:58.535 --> 48:18.990
because he was a Catholic more than anything else, 
and the great Baptist belt runs through the heart

47:58.535 --> 48:18.990
of Texas and spreads almost to the borders of both 
directions,

47:58.535 --> 48:18.990
that he would have not had much better luck than Al 
Smith did.

48:23.240 --> 48:28.867
Al Smith did not have a run-in aid from Texas.

48:32.451 --> 48:52.977
I want it to be known that this is my analysis of this 
case, what I've been able to learn about it, what

48:32.451 --> 48:52.977
has been published and printed by the news media, 
and what has been released by the Warren

48:32.451 --> 48:52.977
Commission.
