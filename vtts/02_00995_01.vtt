WEBVTT

00:02.640 --> 00:04.559
Mic test one, two, three. Mic test one, two, three. 
I'm in the process of conducting an interview with

00:06.640 --> 00:12.970
somebody dealing with the assassination of John 
F. Kennedy. My name is Eugene Sepulveda. Today is

00:14.442 --> 00:17.970
March the 12th, 1980. This is just, this is another 
volume test, just another volume. Okay, but were

00:22.260 --> 00:29.200
you as the rank of a detective or were you as the rank 
of a police patrolman? Eight years as a detective,

00:29.180 --> 00:33.200
ten years as a lieutenant detective. Okay.

00:42.704 --> 00:44.990
Okay, so could I have this again? If this is 
correct, if this is incorrect, please correct me.

00:48.980 --> 00:50.407
Your name is John B. Evans. You're 33 and a half 
years as a policeman, eight years as a detective,

00:51.151 --> 00:56.518
and two years as a lieutenant detective. Is that 
correct? No. Okay. All in the Criminal

00:58.980 --> 01:04.000
Investigation Bureau, they call it. All right. 
Can you just kind of start off like we started

01:07.765 --> 01:10.020
talking yesterday? Okay. Yeah. Have you got that 
thing on? Yeah.

01:21.296 --> 01:23.322
My name is John B. Evans. I am 64 years of age. I've 
been born in 1916. And

01:29.860 --> 01:51.980
I predicate what I am about to say

01:29.860 --> 01:51.980
on experience in the field of criminal 
investigation,

01:29.860 --> 01:51.980
which had a tenure of in excess of 33 years. In the 
fifth largest city in the United States. Which

01:57.760 --> 01:58.661
was? Houston, Texas.

02:04.606 --> 02:34.630
Let me say that in my experience, I have found

02:04.606 --> 02:34.630
from the institution of criminal investigation 
all the way through the courts that a necessary

02:04.606 --> 02:34.630
item for any human being old enough to answer for 
his or her acts must be a criminal

02:04.606 --> 02:34.630
record. And that must be that they would be sane at 
the time of the commission of the act

02:34.610 --> 02:57.090
and aware of the consequences in the event the 
prosecution resulted as a punishment for such

02:34.610 --> 02:57.090
acts. And the only exception

02:57.070 --> 03:14.670
for adult sane human beings

02:57.070 --> 03:14.670
or adult beings would have to be insanity. Which 
they could not be prosecuted under their

03:14.650 --> 03:20.829
condition. They have no control over their acts or 
are not conscious of what their acts might result

03:20.849 --> 03:27.950
in. From

03:27.930 --> 03:48.580
the time that the assassination of John 
Fitzgerald Kennedy, President of the United

03:27.930 --> 03:48.580
States of America in 1963,

03:27.930 --> 03:48.580
occurred in Dallas, Texas, I have had a theory 
that, from a criminal investigation point, that

03:57.560 --> 04:13.220
certain individuals had certain motives

03:57.560 --> 04:13.220
which led to this assassination. I

04:13.200 --> 04:31.780
will begin with the individual whom I consider to 
have the prime motive of personal gain and

04:13.200 --> 04:31.780
prestige

04:13.200 --> 04:31.780
as a result of this incident. And that would be, at 
that time, Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson,

04:39.250 --> 04:53.630
whose

04:39.250 --> 04:53.630
motive,

04:39.250 --> 04:53.630
personal gain and power and prestige would have 
been the presidency of the United States. And it is

04:53.610 --> 05:03.020
incumbent upon the Vice President, in the event a 
President deceases, while in office, to assume

05:05.000 --> 05:10.750
the office of President of the United States.

05:15.210 --> 05:26.540
From observation of incidents a number of years 
prior to the assassination, concerning Mr.

05:26.520 --> 05:31.400
Johnson and some other individuals, and 
additional individuals after the fact of the

05:31.380 --> 05:38.410
assassination, leads me to suspect

05:38.390 --> 05:46.050
and firmly believe that the other individuals 
involved in that case were

05:51.850 --> 05:58.920
George Parr, who was the

05:58.900 --> 06:08.620
alleged kingpin of politics in South Texas, 
namely Duval and Starr counties,

06:14.700 --> 06:16.720
Lee Harvey Oswald, who was a former United States 
Marine, and

06:24.950 --> 06:32.350
who, reliable information tells me, had 
received, at this honorable discharge, from that

06:34.330 --> 06:38.350
arm of the military service, and Jack Ruby, who 
operated a series of

06:42.470 --> 06:55.900
questionable

06:42.470 --> 06:55.900
business establishments, referred to 
ordinarily as striptease joints, in Dallas,

06:58.880 --> 07:01.150
Texas, implying the basic rules of criminal 
investigation, wherein a motive is a necessary

07:07.660 --> 07:11.680
item when you reach the prosecution stage, in any 
case, to obtain a conviction.

07:24.970 --> 07:33.180
The

07:24.970 --> 07:33.180
afore stated George Parr, who was renowned to be a 
very close friend to the aforesaid Lyndon Baines

07:36.570 --> 07:40.590
Johnson, for a long period of years, was

07:42.570 --> 07:52.580
alleged by various investigative 
organizations, including the Federal Bureau of

07:52.560 --> 07:54.580
Investigation, and other private citizens, to 
have arranged so that, at an election, in a contest

08:09.050 --> 08:13.310
for a state senatorship between Lyndon Baines 
Johnson and Coke R. Stevenson, rather

08:20.620 --> 08:29.630
early in Johnson's career as a politician, that

08:29.610 --> 08:42.350
George Parr had

08:29.610 --> 08:42.350
arranged for the election returns to be reported 
to the election central in Dallas,

08:50.440 --> 08:55.550
Texas, after an election had been held on a 
Saturday, until sometime the following

08:58.530 --> 09:02.220
Wednesday, by which time

09:02.200 --> 09:09.800
most of the votes which had been reported in the 
balance of the state had had time to be fairly well

09:14.400 --> 09:17.420
canvassed, a vote from Duval County, to be 
reported to the election central in Dallas. And

09:29.800 --> 09:34.820
prior to the reporting of Duval County vote, Coke

09:34.800 --> 09:42.010
Stevenson had a slight lead in the race over Lyndon 
Johnson, but Johnson would not concede the

09:45.650 --> 09:48.670
election until all of the boxers in the state were 
heard from, and that included Duval County. After

09:56.030 --> 10:01.780
the votes were finally called in, or reported by 
mail, or whatever means they were reported, from

10:05.760 --> 10:09.560
Duval County, Lyndon Johnson showed to have an 
89-vote lead in the race for the senator's job in

10:19.620 --> 10:22.590
the statewide election. And

10:22.570 --> 10:27.660
at that time, Coke Stevenson conceded the 
election to Lyndon Baines Johnson, and Johnson

10:32.690 --> 10:36.710
became a senator in the state of Texas. Some

10:36.690 --> 10:43.160
years later, during

10:43.140 --> 10:49.230
the administration of Harry S. Truman as 
president of the United States, it came to pass,

10:54.450 --> 11:01.450
according to the news media's reports, 
concerning George Parr. George Parr had been

11:03.430 --> 11:09.610
indicted by the federal court on

11:12.250 --> 11:17.590
income tax evasion or falsification of his income 
tax report, uh,

11:20.570 --> 11:27.200
summarily tried and found guilty and assessed a 
penalty of 10 years in federal

11:30.180 --> 11:35.390
prison. But after the jury had found Parr guilty, 
put the case on appeal, and, uh, sometime later,

11:50.260 --> 11:53.590
received a presidential pardon from Harry S. 
Truman. Harry

11:56.430 --> 12:06.330
Truman hailed from the state of Missouri, and no 
mention has ever been made publicly by anyone that

12:11.000 --> 12:14.260
Harry Truman and George Parr had ever heard of each 
other, much less know each other. So I presume that

12:22.050 --> 12:24.070
the case was that they were strangers to each 
other, unknowns to each other. Okay, can I stop you

12:28.050 --> 12:30.540
for a minute for a voice check? Sure. When I was 
zooming, I just took a voice check. All right. And

12:35.663 --> 12:36.540
we're gonna continue. Yeah, that's perfect. Now

12:37.520 --> 12:46.730
that,

12:37.520 --> 12:46.730
uh, Lyndon Johnson was no longer in debt to George 
Parr or

12:51.710 --> 12:57.390
the, uh, ballot box packing or stuffing which 
obtained him the, uh, senator's job, according to

13:04.090 --> 13:10.380
reports

13:04.090 --> 13:10.380
from the FBI and, uh, various citizens, the,

13:13.360 --> 13:18.990
uh, contrary now held true that, uh, that, uh, 
that, uh, Parr was indebted to Johnson ten

13:26.020 --> 13:31.460
years of his life. In later years,

13:35.730 --> 13:42.260
after Johnson had,

13:35.730 --> 13:42.260
uh, worked his way up to Senate majority leader in 
the Senate, and the, uh, presidential election

13:51.320 --> 13:55.070
came, was to come about in the year of 1960, and the 
Democrat convention was held at San Francisco,

14:01.200 --> 14:04.220
California, wherein, uh, Johnson seeked the, uh, 
nomination of the Democratic party to run for

14:11.850 --> 14:13.870
president against,

14:13.850 --> 14:20.510
uh, Richard Milhouse Nixon who the, uh, 
Republicans had nominated as their candidate.

14:25.490 --> 14:31.670
Johnson

14:25.490 --> 14:31.670
failed to get the nomination and the nomination 
was given to, uh, John Fitzgerald Kennedy of

14:37.000 --> 14:43.975
Massachusetts.

14:43.995 --> 14:45.100
And, uh, the feeling of the party was that, uh, the 
state of Texas would be a necessary item of support

14:57.900 --> 14:58.921
in order for Kennedy to win the election. And 
therefore, the, uh, position of, uh, candidacy

15:07.640 --> 15:08.661
for the vice presidency

15:08.640 --> 15:12.930
was, uh, submitted to Johnson and he accepted.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.510
In 1958, I believe, uh, Mr. George Parr who still 
politically ruled, uh, Duval County managed

15:37.560 --> 15:42.960
to get his hands on, uh, some of the county's school 
funds

15:46.570 --> 15:52.460
and was indicted by a state grand jury and tried in 
state district court and found guilty of felony

16:00.820 --> 16:01.841
theft of school funds and assessed the then 
maximum penalty for felony theft for the first

16:08.500 --> 16:09.521
offense of 10 years. He served in, uh, what was then 
known as the, uh, TSPS Texas State Prison

16:18.370 --> 16:24.300
System. This case was, uh, put on appeal and Parr 
remained free on appeal bond. The

16:32.400 --> 16:36.540
case wound its way through the Court of Criminal 
Appeals and would have ultimately gone to the

16:41.520 --> 16:43.540
state Supreme Court. During

16:43.520 --> 16:49.380
the, uh, interim, the 1960 election, the 
President of the United States occurred in John

16:54.790 --> 16:57.660
Fitzgerald Kennedy, who was elected President 
and then named Johnson Vice President of the

17:03.760 --> 17:04.781
United States. To the best of my recollection of 
what occurred, the,

17:07.760 --> 17:12.710
uh, inauguration of, uh, Kennedy and

17:14.690 --> 17:18.560
Johnson as owner about the 12th of January of 1961. 
And so, uh, the President of the United States was

17:25.540 --> 17:28.990
elected as President of the United States and

17:29.970 --> 17:37.260
sometime

17:29.970 --> 17:37.260
between the middle and the end of the month of

17:40.240 --> 17:44.460
March that same year, George Parr received 
presidential pardon from John Fitzgerald

17:48.440 --> 17:57.370
Kennedy

17:48.440 --> 17:57.370
for his felony theft. These matters, uh, would of 
necessity appear in the official records of the

18:05.850 --> 18:08.410
government of the United States and the state of

18:09.480 --> 18:14.780
Texas, official court records and so forth, and,

18:16.760 --> 18:22.940
uh, we had

18:22.920 --> 18:26.720
a lot of questions and partings proceeded

18:28.700 --> 18:32.470
on and during the summer of 1963 the Democratic 
Party in the state of Texas

18:38.470 --> 18:42.850
became split into several different factions. I

18:44.920 --> 18:48.750
believe there were about

18:48.730 --> 18:52.540
seven all told. And, uh, Lyndon Johnson caused the

18:56.520 --> 19:01.250
year of 1964 was to be the year that

19:03.230 --> 19:07.100
he had, uh, had a talk with, uh, President Kennedy 
and at that time Governor John B. Conley, the

19:15.100 --> 19:17.880
governor of the state of Texas, to the effect that 
he and the Johnson and, uh, the President should

19:25.860 --> 19:27.880
come to Texas on what he termed a fence-mending 
tour in order to get the,

19:36.110 --> 19:39.620
uh, uh, vote for the people who were active in the 
state of Texas, uh, in

19:49.880 --> 19:56.570
the Senate, in the Senate of Texas in the Senate, 
and

20:02.730 --> 20:07.750
then in the Senate of the Senate of the Senate of the 
Senate of the Senate in Dallas, Texas,

20:16.960 --> 20:29.019
and several other rather prominent national 
figures. The Democratic Party had attempted to

20:29.260 --> 20:35.238
make speeches in Dallas, Texas. They received 
vegetables and eggs, some sticks and stones

20:39.090 --> 20:51.580
directed at the speakers

20:39.090 --> 20:51.580
instead of any applause or exception of their 
speech.

20:58.200 --> 21:01.510
Also, well publicized at the time, General Walker 
had sustained a bullet hole in the picture window

21:01.490 --> 21:08.890
of his living room in his home in Dallas, Texas. 
Sustained a near miss from the bullet that put the

21:11.918 --> 21:21.022
hole there. So that it was published to me by the 
news media. Newspapers, radio and television.

21:34.816 --> 21:51.215
John Connolly had advised against the president 
and the vice president both coming to Texas at the

21:34.816 --> 21:51.215
same time, together, going to various 
municipalities in the state on this

21:34.816 --> 21:51.215
fence-mending tour because it was dangerous. And 
especially the attitude of the people in Dallas,

21:52.576 --> 21:56.200
Texas.

21:59.684 --> 22:04.950
But somehow, Johnson, according to reports in the 
news media, persuaded the president and Governor

22:04.930 --> 22:20.722
Connolly that he and the president would not 
receive any such treatment, even in Dallas.

22:24.145 --> 22:28.588
So they decided to come to Dallas. And immediately 
the news media began to publish

22:28.608 --> 22:44.020
stories about the anticipated visit of the 
president and the vice president, detailing when

22:28.608 --> 22:44.020
they would be in each city. municipality that they 
were to visit. And publishing in the newspapers

22:48.773 --> 22:58.680
prominently displayed on the front pages, they 
planned the motorcade route that they would

22:58.660 --> 23:07.732
follow through each of these municipalities as 
they progressed on their visitation. These

23:07.752 --> 23:09.900
diagrams were also displayed on television quite 
frequently on each of these cities.

23:17.622 --> 23:20.510
And so that it would be knowledge to the people who 
might want to have a chance to see the president and

23:20.890 --> 23:26.730
vice president and their governor all 
simultaneously

23:26.710 --> 23:36.700
and be able to position themselves along these 
motorcade routes for that purpose.

23:44.279 --> 23:52.860
Now,

23:44.279 --> 23:52.860
prior to becoming governor of the state of Texas, 
John B. Conley served at the cabinet level

23:52.840 --> 24:07.920
in Washington, D.C., in the capacity of Secretary 
of the Navy. And during that tenure, Lee Harvey

24:10.367 --> 24:18.890
Oswald received his dishonorable discharge from 
the Marine Corps.

24:23.780 --> 24:33.360
And it has been publicized considerably that 
Oswald

24:23.780 --> 24:33.360
had written letters to

24:33.340 --> 24:37.140
John Conley. Request him that he, as Secretary of 
the Navy, review his case and consider an upgrade

24:37.380 --> 24:50.530
from dishonorable to something more desirable in 
the way of a discharge, and that Oswald was ignored

24:57.270 --> 24:59.654
by Conley.

25:03.422 --> 25:13.240
During the summer and early fall, while all the 
publicity was going around To the пробes of

25:13.720 --> 25:17.090
theayHoose judgment, the estrangement of all 
different social media across the state,

25:17.070 --> 25:25.000
possibly across the country,

25:17.070 --> 25:25.000
pertaining to the visit of the president and vice 
president and the governor of these

25:24.980 --> 25:32.690
municipalities,

25:32.670 --> 25:43.350
Lee Harvey Oswald, somehow, in spite of reported 
sustenance of two homes, one in Fort Worth and one

25:43.330 --> 25:53.220
in Dallas, without being employed at all, managed 
to defray the expense of making a trip to Mexico

25:53.360 --> 25:56.410
City.

26:02.009 --> 26:05.200
And according to what has been published of the FBI 
report and the Warren report, Oswald crossed the

26:05.180 --> 26:15.900
Rio Grande River at a small village called Roma, 
Texas, which is the connecting bridge between

26:15.880 --> 26:29.360
Starr County, the county seat of which is Rio 
Grande City,

26:29.340 --> 26:38.303
Old

26:29.340 --> 26:38.303
Mexico.

26:41.832 --> 26:45.040
This was also alleged to have been the route that he 
was traced in returning from Mexico City back to

26:45.020 --> 26:48.740
Dallas. It was reported by both the FBI and the 
Warren Commission that Oswald was traced to the

26:52.520 --> 26:59.540
Cuban consulate in Mexico City as well as the 
Russian consulate, but did not hold any

26:59.520 --> 27:07.880
conversation, transact any business with anyone 
at either of these two places. Thank you. Thank

27:10.778 --> 27:11.880
you. If anyone would like to repeat that, that is 
fine. Service. It's done by the National

27:17.482 --> 27:20.190
Geographic Service. has been

27:22.170 --> 27:36.200
a

27:36.180 --> 27:43.110
particular Do you have more, or the FBI or the 
Warren Commission.

27:52.466 --> 28:00.200
At the time this was all going on, in 1963,

27:52.466 --> 28:00.200
George Parr's nephew, Archer Parr, was county 
sheriff in Starr

28:00.180 --> 28:12.827
County. During this same period, Jack Ruby, the 
girly nightclub operator,

28:19.120 --> 28:32.930
for some mysterious reason, became exceedingly 
friendly with a lot of members of the Dallas Police

28:32.910 --> 28:42.870
Department, or at least this is what they and the 
FBI and the Warren Commission all concurred was

28:42.850 --> 28:48.787
fact. In my experience as a municipal police 
officer, taught me long ago that this is a highly

28:54.960 --> 29:10.639
unusual for people in that type of business

28:54.960 --> 29:10.639
to do anything regarding police except try to 
avoid it. Certainly not to be visiting the police

29:11.040 --> 29:21.874
station and getting well acquainted with the high 
ranking officials and all this.

29:24.698 --> 29:41.380
It is my belief that

29:24.698 --> 29:41.380
Lee Harvey Oswald was afforded an opportunity by 
someone

29:24.698 --> 29:41.380
to have an opportunity to Connolly not John 
Kennedy.

29:51.248 --> 29:54.500
There has been nothing to indicate the any 
motivation whatsoever for Lee Harvey Oswald to

29:54.480 --> 30:03.570
want to kill John Kennedy. But there is sufficient 
motive in the ignoring of his plea for help

30:06.520 --> 30:15.400
pertaining to his dishonorable discharge from 
John Connolly to cause an individual with a

30:15.380 --> 30:25.400
temperament that the people who claimed to know 
him said that Oswald had

30:25.380 --> 30:37.140
to try to assassinate John Connolly.

30:40.312 --> 30:47.700
And John Connolly was struck by some of the bullets 
that were fired into the car in which he and Kennedy

30:47.680 --> 30:51.200
were riding. Can I ask you a question? Yes. 
Question. Was the motorcade route that they

30:55.219 --> 31:02.210
traveled by the depository, was that pre-planned 
or was that a last minute change? The chief police

31:05.850 --> 31:15.010
of the city of Dallas at that time wrote a book, 
which is easily available to anybody that wants it

31:14.990 --> 31:25.470
in almost any bookstore and certainly any 
library,

31:14.990 --> 31:25.470
stating that approximately 30 minutes before 
departure time for the motorcade with the

31:25.450 --> 31:35.210
President Kennedy, Vice President Johnson and 
Governor John Connolly's wives had been changed,

31:35.190 --> 31:45.080
around the motorcade, approximately 30 minutes 
prior to departure time. So that it went by the

31:49.658 --> 31:55.500
books storage building unfortunately, in Mann

31:55.480 --> 32:02.950
Tapi venes. Oswald was alleged to have shot the 
president

32:04.574 --> 32:15.000
and he was never able to determine who ordered this 
altering of the motorcade route.

32:21.599 --> 32:27.200
But the order did come and the route was changed so 
that the motorcade did pass by that building.

32:35.024 --> 32:39.680
Of course,

32:35.024 --> 32:39.680
I have not mentioned the motive of Jack Ruby for any 
part in the assassination.

32:50.351 --> 32:53.460
I have known many people of many religious 
organizations

32:53.440 --> 33:07.060
and I have rather consistently found that there is 
still a great deal of animosity between Baptists

33:07.040 --> 33:20.965
and Catholics and even more between Jews

33:07.040 --> 33:20.965
and Catholics. I was rejected

33:26.840 --> 33:43.750
a Democrat state who elected to support Herbert 
Clark Hoover much heavier than they did Al Smith in

33:44.450 --> 33:51.440
1928

33:44.450 --> 33:51.440
for the presidency of this country because Al 
Smith was Catholic and no other reason was ever

33:51.980 --> 33:53.986
given.

33:57.859 --> 34:04.700
And that was the only Republican that was ever 
supported by a majority of the voters in the state

34:06.330 --> 34:13.910
of Texas for pregnancy since the state of Texas had 
been in existence as a state.

34:21.325 --> 34:29.401
The next one that ever was was Richard Nixon.

34:29.421 --> 34:33.750
And his

34:29.421 --> 34:33.750
margin was not nearly as great as Hoover's.

34:41.814 --> 34:47.050
Now, the

34:41.814 --> 34:47.050
circumstances indicate for me that Jack Ruby was 
in on the conspiracy—an for

34:51.360 --> 35:03.880
the purpose of making sure that Lee Harvey Oswald 
did not tell authorities too much in the event he

35:03.860 --> 35:12.439
got caught and wasn't killed in the process of what 
transpired. And that

35:12.580 --> 35:21.445
is exactly what he did. And he became a common sight 
around the Dallas police station so that he could

35:26.660 --> 35:37.880
gain access to Oswald sufficient to allow him to 
hush him up by taking his life. When the transfer on

35:37.860 --> 35:49.640
a Sunday morning after the assassination from the 
Dallas City Police Station to the Dallas County

35:49.620 --> 36:01.650
Jail was attempted,

35:49.620 --> 36:01.650
millions of people who were watching the 
proceedings live Dallas County Jail. And they

36:04.998 --> 36:05.932
were taken to the Dallas County Jail. And they were 
taken to the

36:09.460 --> 36:32.370
That is exactly what Jack Ruby did, and no one ever 
offered any motive for Jack Ruby's actions other

36:09.460 --> 36:32.370
than that he just thought so much of the President 
of the United States that he decided to kill the man

36:09.460 --> 36:32.370
that was alleged to have killed him. But this does 
not explain why a strip-junk operator prior to any

36:32.350 --> 36:50.650
assassination or any threat of it or anything else 
on the President got himself so familiarized

36:32.350 --> 36:50.650
around the Dallas police station that he could 
gain access to Oswald in the first place. Let's

36:50.630 --> 36:56.013
see how much tape we have left. Okay. Let's see. We 
have plenty of tape. Insofar

36:57.760 --> 37:08.070
as I have been able to determine what has been 
released in the way of, uh... even basic criminal

37:08.050 --> 37:30.340
investigative efforts on the part of either the 
FBI or the Warren Commission in the tracing of

37:08.050 --> 37:30.340
Oswald's

37:08.050 --> 37:30.340
movements to Mexico City and back, tracing

37:30.320 --> 37:49.490
the rifle, which was alleged to have been the 
murder weapon,

37:30.320 --> 37:49.490
and which was reportedly left behind in the 
bookstore's building, to Lee Harvey

37:49.470 --> 38:05.440
Oswald, and, uh, making ballistics tests and 
checking this weapon for fingerprints. Other

38:05.420 --> 38:28.400
elements of criminal investigation appear to me 
to be rather nil, and no one ever did offer any

38:05.420 --> 38:28.400
true motivation on the part of Oswald having taken 
the line for the President, or even attempting to

38:28.380 --> 38:30.800
lie to John Conley. The only explanation that has 
ever been said that I have heard is the possible

38:31.780 --> 38:42.800
links of KGB because of his departure to Russia. 
And what is your opinion of that? The belief was

38:46.350 --> 38:57.400
that Oswald appeared to be, that Oswald, from 
these accounts, that Oswald was linked to the

38:46.350 --> 38:57.400
Russian KGB, and, uh, this

38:57.380 --> 39:04.220
was, uh, supposed to have been Oswald. Uh-huh. 
Uh-huh. But it had been determined by the CIA prior

39:06.200 --> 39:12.220
to what transpired in Dallas, but no, uh, tail was 
placed on Lee Harvey Oswald at that time to see what

39:12.200 --> 39:27.560
he was doing during this locate

39:12.200 --> 39:27.560
proceedings through the city of Dallas. Isn't, 
isn't it common, I mean, isn't it common for

39:27.540 --> 39:38.560
anybody who has ever had anything to do with maybe 
even a threat to the President or with late, to the

39:38.540 --> 39:48.650
KGB to have secret servicemen around them or at 
least following them? That is, not only applies to

39:48.630 --> 39:54.490
the President, but all members of his family, the 
Vice President and all members of his family, and

39:54.470 --> 40:05.370
any serious candidate for the Presidency at all is 
requested. This is besides the bodyguards of the

40:05.350 --> 40:13.590
candidate or the President themselves, but they 
do also, any person that they believe will

40:13.570 --> 40:18.170
threaten, isn't it usual that they will go and that 
they will watch that person? It is my

40:19.850 --> 40:29.540
understanding that especially that during the 
time when there is a, when the President or any

40:29.520 --> 40:36.040
member of his family is known to be in the proximity 
of the President, there There is a threat. I know

40:36.820 --> 40:44.820
that the majority of any individual who might be 
believed to be a foreign agent,

40:51.420 --> 40:55.160
At least during that time. It would be a special 
effort to keep them under closer than normal

40:55.140 --> 41:02.730
surveillance by FBI, CIS, Secret Service, all.

41:10.030 --> 41:21.020
But

41:10.030 --> 41:21.020
I noticed that after Lyndon

41:10.030 --> 41:21.020
Johnson was deceived by the KGB and the FBI came 
learning It is true. case.

41:25.047 --> 41:36.490
George Parr got tangled up in another theft 
business with the case, tried to find and found

41:36.470 --> 41:39.510
guilty again and assessed prison terms. What was 
this other case, can you say? This other case after

41:44.318 --> 41:46.510
Linda Thompson's death, what was this other case, 
what was it? I believe it was something pertaining

41:48.490 --> 41:57.780
to the county treasury funds in Duval County. At 
any rate, they found him dead where he, according

41:57.760 --> 42:07.820
to the investigation that followed that, the 
victim of suicide, since there was no way of

42:07.800 --> 42:14.300
getting another presidential pardon, because 
Johnson was no longer around.

42:21.704 --> 42:23.450
There wasn't anybody to prevail upon any 
president then to give

42:23.430 --> 42:28.520
him the pardon for his suicide. This

42:28.500 --> 42:38.540
further convinces me that Johnson was 
engineering the, uh, the presidential pardons

42:38.520 --> 42:45.570
that he did

42:38.520 --> 42:45.570
get. Did, uh, were you ever in Star, were you ever a 
patrolman in Star County yourself? Have I ever

42:52.550 --> 42:53.571
been there? Have you, have you ever been a 
patrolman in Star County? I've never been a

42:57.550 --> 43:00.570
patrolman there, I was a soldier there. Okay, you 
were a soldier there. At the time that Rigby

43:02.137 --> 43:07.780
Clifton had gone to Mexico, is there any knowledge 
of him having stopped before he had crossed the

43:07.760 --> 43:11.780
border? I have never heard anything pertaining to 
that whatsoever. I don't know, uh, nothing

43:16.760 --> 43:24.790
stipulated that, uh, any effort was made on the 
part of the FBI or the Warren Commission, either

43:24.770 --> 43:29.790
one, to see if he did actually stop in Rio Grande 
City or figure off through Duval County or some

43:29.770 --> 43:36.390
other place and make any contact with anybody. 
There's never been any, anything published

43:36.370 --> 43:42.900
saying that he did, and nothing published saying 
that he didn't. But there was certainly every

43:43.880 --> 43:50.040
opportunity in the world for him to have done so, 
because he was, had to go directly through Rio

43:50.020 --> 43:56.120
Grande City. And wasn't that the only, wasn't that 
the only, the only bridge, the only access to

43:56.100 --> 44:03.120
Mexico through that route? That, that is the, 
between, uh, I believe, well, it, it is, uh, the,

44:03.100 --> 44:13.560
was then, and I think still is, the next place, 
west, or northwest, on the Rio Grande, that you

44:19.760 --> 44:32.860
could cross on a bridge after you leave Reynosa.

44:32.840 --> 44:35.860
I think there was another bridge until you got to 
Roma at that time. And only one highway was, uh, ran

44:35.840 --> 44:41.210
right through the middle of town, and the railroad 
track ran parallel to it up to Rio Grande City. And,

44:48.040 --> 44:53.980
uh, there, there was a Y formed in the track so that 
the engine could turn around and go to the other end

44:53.960 --> 44:59.980
of the train and go back to Mission. Having,

44:59.960 --> 45:08.060
uh, been stationed at Fort Ringgold, which was, 
uh, an army post for the United States Cavalry, 1st

45:13.420 --> 45:15.440
Cavalry Division, from August the 7th of 1940 to 
around the middle of February of 1941, I had an

45:24.310 --> 45:30.110
occasion to find out that that was the only road 
through there. You,

45:31.090 --> 45:39.900
you've said, and I want to get it down, that, what is 
your belief that why John, why Johnson would

45:43.880 --> 45:46.900
accept the nomination for Vice President? Would, 
would an ulterior motive, or, or why would

45:46.880 --> 45:53.270
Kennedy? It, uh, it would appear to me that, uh, 
that since Johnson already held the position of,

45:57.250 --> 46:02.270
uh, Senate Majority Leader, which, uh, was much 
more powerful and prestigious than that of Vice

46:02.250 --> 46:07.270
President, and second only to the President

46:07.250 --> 46:12.150
himself, that, uh, Johnson's only hope to ever be 
President, which he was seeking to be, the 1960

46:21.300 --> 46:26.300
Democratic Convention, and made no bones about 
it, that his only chance would be to become Vice

46:30.250 --> 46:36.610
President, and then the President whom he was 
serving with, would, to seize an office, would

46:42.880 --> 46:46.280
become, uh, incapable of carrying on the duties of 
the President. It might also, uh, be noted that,

46:49.260 --> 46:55.420
uh, Judge Cyril T. Hughes was a federal judge who, 
uh, swore in Johnson as President aboard the Air

47:01.840 --> 47:08.420
Force One in Dallas, Texas. Some, according to the 
news media, 30 minutes after the President had

47:12.580 --> 47:18.380
been pronounced dead, and

47:18.360 --> 47:24.860
that, uh, she was, uh, suggested,

47:24.840 --> 47:31.590
so the story goes, by Johnson to be nominated for 
the federal judgeship by the President. Okay. Um,

47:45.794 --> 47:48.550
is it, is it you believe that without Johnson's 
support in Texas, Kennedy could have carried

47:50.530 --> 47:52.550
Texas? I always figured that, uh, because he was a 
Catholic, more than anything else, a great

48:04.410 --> 48:05.431
Baptist, with a great disability, runs through 
the heart of Texas, and spreads almost to the

48:08.410 --> 48:14.250
borders in both directions,

48:14.230 --> 48:17.250
that he would have not had much better luck than, 
uh, Al Smith

48:17.230 --> 48:25.480
did. Al Smith did not have a run-in aid from Texas.

48:34.930 --> 48:37.950
I want it to be known that this is, uh, my analysis of 
this case, from what I've been able to learn about

48:39.930 --> 48:41.950
it, and what I, what has been published and printed 
by the news media, and, uh, what has been released

48:48.690 --> 48:53.150
by the Warren Commission.
