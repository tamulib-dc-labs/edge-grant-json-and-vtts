WEBVTT

00:05.262 --> 00:12.329
Tell me about your first job with 143rd Infantry. 
Where were you stationed? Where were they sent

00:13.250 --> 00:14.231
you? Well, upon mobilization, initially we 
stayed at home station because, you know, the

00:14.611 --> 00:25.943
camps weren't ready.

00:29.046 --> 00:32.890
And that program then was to bring the National 
Guard in for one year. one year only. In other

00:35.978 --> 00:40.464
words, that was just to get them and train them in 
readiness in the event that it would be needed. And

00:41.725 --> 00:51.197
after about, oh, I guess a month, we went to Camp Bui 
at Brownwood. We lived in tents with very

00:51.217 --> 00:58.066
comfortable tents. They had a concrete slab, you 
know, and there was a tent frame. And we had gas. so

01:04.527 --> 01:10.613
in the morning all you had to do with the pilot line 
was just pull that lever. Somebody nearest had a

01:10.873 --> 01:16.298
string of wire tied to it so it was warm when you got 
out of bed. And we trained there.

01:22.104 --> 01:24.366
And didn't have fatigues, it didn't wear 
fatigues. That becomes a really

01:24.386 --> 01:33.235
rather vivid in my memory because we were wearing 
Those days, you know, we had pinks and greens, pink

01:34.025 --> 01:38.630
trousers and green jackets. And we were wearing 
those pinks out on the field to train with. And of

01:44.756 --> 01:48.319
course, around Brownwood, this thing right here, 
you got all sorts of thorns. And it picked that

01:49.300 --> 01:54.986
fabric to where it all started, ruined it, in other 
words. So everybody ruined their uniform, so they

01:55.006 --> 02:02.093
had to buy a new uniform, another uniform. Another 
interesting thing that happened He did have

02:04.670 --> 02:19.448
post-exchanges at that time, but Lauderstein, 
San Antonio Lauderstein, he provided the

02:04.670 --> 02:19.448
post-exchange facility. It sold uniform. So, you 
know, he had nothing to do with these thornages. He

02:24.495 --> 02:27.258
really had a big business of selling all this. And 
they expensive. Then they went through this

02:29.100 --> 02:34.407
situation of should you have long beaver coats or 
short beaver coats. So we were ordered all to buy

02:36.209 --> 02:38.993
long beaver coats. Everybody had to buy a long 
beaver coat, and they were very expensive. So just

02:44.299 --> 02:48.124
the uniforms were a problem back in 1940. Yeah. And 
the U.S. government couldn't supply all the

02:49.847 --> 02:52.810
troops, in other words. No. Oh, no. They were short 
both clothing and certainly equipment. Oh, sure.

03:00.120 --> 03:04.866
Because there's many pictures and articles 
written about it. In the first Louisiana

03:05.555 --> 03:11.821
maneuver, active mobilization, we went to 
Leesville, Louisiana area. And you had sticks

03:13.003 --> 03:19.670
that represented mortars and logs that 
represented artillery. And even some didn't even

03:19.690 --> 03:21.331
have rifles. They were carrying a wooden replica 
of a rifle. And you should have plenty of rifles

03:26.116 --> 03:31.782
from World War I, though, with those old MPOs or old 
. Your basic mission in the 143rd was training, is

03:32.268 --> 03:36.733
that right? That's right, readiness training. 
And to get equipment and get trained, but mainly to

03:40.517 --> 03:47.605
get the people away from home and in the field. And 
later on, of course, we hadn't got field uniforms.

03:51.750 --> 04:00.840
When we were first there, the only uniform we were 
wearing was what you'd call a dress uniform. Not a

04:01.883 --> 04:03.425
few in the report. Now during this time, 1940, you 
went to the company officer's course at Fort

04:03.445 --> 04:10.076
Benning, Georgia. Yeah. And tell me about that. 
How long was it? What was the curriculum? As I

04:15.083 --> 04:17.327
recall, it was just short of three months. And the 
purpose of that course, now presently, a graduate

04:18.969 --> 04:27.723
ROTC, a graduate military captain, they go to a 
similar course. It's a basic officer's course.

04:31.432 --> 04:34.737
where that you, once again, you're taught map 
reading and weapons training. That's right. Very

04:37.440 --> 04:40.264
similar to Officer Candidate School. It's, of 
course, Officer Candidate School. You've got to

04:41.706 --> 04:46.313
go a little bit farther because they come really as 
recruits. Some of them had some military

04:46.453 --> 04:48.997
training, but very little. But it was that type of 
training, basic officer's course, basic such.

04:57.168 --> 04:58.570
But it was very helpful and very a requirement 
because you had to remember a particular National

05:00.575 --> 05:03.642
Guard. Many National Guard officers were 
appointed in those days. And what training they

05:09.013 --> 05:11.238
had was in the armor. And you just, who trained 
them? Who has the time? Who has the knowledge? So

05:18.093 --> 05:20.338
this, of course, was very necessary. 
particularly for the National Guard officers and

05:21.550 --> 05:30.525
also reserve officers, of course, who had been 
called active duty in a recent drive to the bar of

05:21.550 --> 05:30.525
TC. And they were from all over the United States. 
It was a very interesting course. And two later on,

05:37.155 --> 05:44.267
several of the divisions went to the Far East and, 
of course, others went to Europe. Now, at this

05:44.804 --> 05:51.110
time, of course, the Japanese in 1940 were 
fighting the Chinese since 1937. And on the other

05:52.331 --> 05:58.257
side of the world, the Germans were fighting the 
English at this time. It was about the time of the

05:58.277 --> 06:00.840
Battle of Britain. Did you think that the United 
States would soon be in war? Well,

06:05.545 --> 06:12.111
I think everyone couldn't help but think the way 
things were going would probably be in it. But the

06:17.757 --> 06:18.998
nation didn't think so. And one reason why the 
nation didn't is because Roosevelt kept saying,

06:19.018 --> 06:26.505
you know, that we're not going to send our boys to 
somebody else's war. And

06:28.047 --> 06:36.315
because they've been called back to duty for a 
year, the National Guard, their favorite song

06:28.047 --> 06:36.315
that day is Goodbye, Dear. I'll be back in a year. 
I'm in the Army now. Well, just before the year was

06:40.058 --> 06:43.802
over, Congress voted by one vote, carried by one 
vote, to continue the National Guard on active

06:44.643 --> 06:55.559
duty, even though it was just a short time before 
Pearl Harbor.

06:55.579 --> 07:00.366
Oh, were you happy that it was going to stay on 
National Guard and you weren't going to be placed

06:55.579 --> 07:00.366
back on a reserve status? Oh, yeah. You wanted to 
stay on active duty. Just like after we got

07:05.334 --> 07:09.520
involved in the war, I wanted to go to Europe. Well, 
let's talk about that. What happened? You're

07:14.389 --> 07:17.592
training all the way up until December 7, 1941. Do 
you remember where you were when you heard the news

07:17.712 --> 07:22.316
of Pearl Harbor? Yeah. Cameron, Texas. I was 
having a date with my school teacher's wife to be.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.884
What was your reaction? Well, we had a, or at least I 
had, we were married in a new red Ford convertible.

07:40.465 --> 07:44.909
out Sunday, taking a ride. Of course, we were 
notified to return to base. Well, I would have

07:50.174 --> 07:57.461
returned anyway because anybody knows. Because 
they were pretty well over the radio then. They

08:02.425 --> 08:07.890
announced that it's been heavy casualties and 
damage has been great, but no assessment really

08:08.258 --> 08:10.461
has been made yet. So it wasn't a case of trying to 
keep it quiet how much damage was done. Of course,

08:14.746 --> 08:22.616
no need to, because the Japanese did it and saw them 
sinking and knew what had happened, knew the

08:14.746 --> 08:22.616
extent of the damage. So we went back and stayed in 
Camp Boyd. But then people on the West Coast got

08:30.687 --> 08:37.135
reporting that subs had been sighted. And the West 
Coast particularly felt, and this is what led up to

08:37.638 --> 08:50.873
what occurred with the evacuation of the 
Japanese, you know, and put them in relocation

08:37.638 --> 08:50.873
camp. So they were really hysterical. All up and 
down the Coast Coast, they thought the Japanese

08:52.655 --> 08:56.720
would invade at any time. And that's when they 
thought somebody was sending messages and

08:57.361 --> 09:03.929
receiving and told the innocent were suspect. So 
it was just a general evacuation. Also, at

09:07.726 --> 09:25.691
Freeport, Dow Chemical, they felt that they were 
exposed, and they were making the critical metals

09:07.726 --> 09:25.691
that we needed to build all these aircraft we were 
in the process of building. So we knew they had to

09:25.711 --> 09:29.556
protect Dow Chemical. So our company, E Company 
143rd Infantry, we were alerted at night. to move

09:36.700 --> 09:43.426
by convoy to Freeport to protect Dow Chemical. And 
now you think of it, it sounds kind of oozy asinine

09:44.748 --> 10:00.863
to think you go get, say, 150 or 200 infantrymen 
with rifles, machine guns, to go to protect a

09:44.748 --> 10:00.863
chemical plant that's right on the edge of the 
Gulf, you know, that you service. You could use a

10:00.883 --> 10:06.268
cannon, a larger artillery to destroy it. But they 
were more concerned about sabotage, you know,

10:07.092 --> 10:14.581
because submarines, they'd seen submarines in 
the Gulf. I don't know if they actually saw them or

10:14.641 --> 10:16.123
not. Did you ever, you never saw a submarine in the 
Gulf, did you? And did you ever have any sabotage at

10:19.728 --> 10:31.302
all in the area of Freeport?

10:31.883 --> 10:36.188
Nice tour of duty there, because that's a 
beautiful place there on the Gulf, isn't it? And

10:37.619 --> 10:40.363
they had a nice facility. It was a big building. I 
guess at one time, that must have been a district, a

10:43.508 --> 10:50.798
transit type of thing, because they had beds in 
there that were very comfortable. Of course, we

10:50.818 --> 10:57.247
were on patrol, at least about a third of us at all 
times, up and down the coastline.

11:00.692 --> 11:06.681
So we returned after the scare receded.

11:08.264 --> 11:11.227
Then we moved to Camp Blanding, Florida. And the 
purpose of going to Camp Blanding was to take

11:12.408 --> 11:22.957
further training, of course, and to prepare for an 
overseas ship. It's actually Pearl Harbor now.

11:25.059 --> 11:29.803
And we trained there with the 1st Division, with 
the Corps. And after several months there, and our

11:31.845 --> 11:37.630
troops didn't like that because we moved into 
tents there. But there, they were coal-burning

11:38.217 --> 11:44.324
stoves in the whole area, burning coal. You got 
cinders and all that. And you had to get up and build

11:47.147 --> 11:54.175
a fire, and you missed that nice, clean, natural 
gas. We stayed there for several months. And did

11:57.178 --> 11:59.240
you know where you were headed? You said you were 
preparing for overseas, but you had no idea. No,

12:05.667 --> 12:06.148
no. Then while I was there in the landing, in my job 
then, I was the headquarters company commander in

12:07.175 --> 12:23.096
the S2 wearing two hats. We had a quota to go to 
Brooksfield, Texas to an aerial observation

12:25.079 --> 12:33.250
course. And the plan at that time was that Of 
course, the Air Force wasn't Air Force. It was Air

12:39.309 --> 12:40.570
Corps. It was part of the Army . That if we had a 
mission to accomplish, and we wanted to get

12:44.495 --> 13:05.177
intelligence, information, this trained 
individual would go out to the airstrip, and

12:44.495 --> 13:05.177
getting the back seat of an aircraft flown by the 
air, and telling what the mission was, and even

12:44.495 --> 13:05.177
plan it, navigate it. And we'd go out, take 
pictures, whatever the mission was, and then

13:05.917 --> 13:12.865
return to base. In other words, the person on the 
ground that knew what he wanted was trained to go up

13:12.945 --> 13:18.331
and sit in a plane and accomplish it. And so that's 
what I was down at Brookfield, which is very

13:19.553 --> 13:24.038
interesting. In addition to aerial photography, 
navigation, flexible machine gun, you're also

13:24.098 --> 13:34.270
trained to to adjust artillery

13:36.106 --> 13:42.772
using code CW. So you had to be a radio operator and 
all sorts of things. So that was what that course

13:46.496 --> 13:48.077
was about. And it's very interesting, although 
sometimes it can be kind of hairy on the flights. We

13:55.484 --> 13:56.705
also had night flights. Because the pilots of 
these planes, and they were 052s, heavy.

14:03.933 --> 14:06.236
underpowered as far as the Indians concerned. It 
was really a Navy plane. The landing gear

14:09.000 --> 14:14.026
retracted up into the fuselage. In fact, there's 
one down there near Houston, the side of the road

14:14.046 --> 14:18.292
now that's been there all this year. It's part of a 
tavern or something. I think they call it the ship

14:20.114 --> 14:24.660
or the airship. Because we lost quite a few. They 
get lost and run out of fuel. And fortunately, mine

14:29.667 --> 14:31.189
didn't. although we ground looped on takeoff one 
time. Anyway, but these pilots were just out of

14:36.449 --> 14:39.533
flying school. They didn't like the plane either. 
They didn't have much confidence in themselves,

14:41.696 --> 14:45.021
particularly in the plane. And at night, another 
thing at that time, you took off on one frequency,

14:46.182 --> 15:02.425
and as soon as you got airborne, then you had to 
retune your radio to a ground station. away from

15:03.569 --> 15:07.314
the field. Daytime is no problem, but at nighttime 
with an inexperienced pilot, and we had several

15:07.334 --> 15:18.828
that went to Mexico, got lost and went to Raleigh, 
and of course had to bail out, for sure. So at night,

15:19.990 --> 15:23.935
I never did even retune. I kept it on our station. 
And of course, I made a low mark on my communication

15:28.621 --> 15:33.407
with the base station down below. Because I wasn't 
about to get up there and not be able to get back to

15:34.096 --> 15:39.260
the ground. But the main reason, it wasn't because 
of the retuning. That was simple, although they

15:41.623 --> 15:43.544
didn't have push buttons. You had to get down there 
and turn this thing and get it just at the right

15:43.564 --> 15:51.431
setting. At night, while you're down and you plan 
your navigation course on time, distance on

15:52.392 --> 16:04.002
headings and time, I didn't want to be down and not 
observing for that pilot, because he might get

16:06.125 --> 16:15.058
disoriented or something in mid. I was flying at 
night with the lights. You know, you fly at night,

16:18.322 --> 16:22.828
you know, you pick as you plan it all, you know where 
everything is. And we got back each time. Another

16:26.413 --> 16:36.047
problem they had on landing, though, the 
aircraft, you had to crank down an antenna that had

16:26.413 --> 16:36.047
a great big, well, it was about the size of that, 
lead, you crank that down. But you'd have to

16:40.292 --> 16:49.205
remember to crank that thing up before you land it, 
because if not, boy, you'd hang it on wires and

16:40.292 --> 16:49.205
people's heads and so forth. And a lot of them would 
forget to reel up their antenna. Another common,

16:54.552 --> 17:02.584
of course, mistake was made is that they'd forget 
to take the cover over the camera. They'd go out and

17:03.618 --> 17:07.843
fly all this nation back and forth, you know, make 
these strips, come back and find out. All they took

17:09.484 --> 17:11.587
was a picture of the cover. But returned back, and 
when I got back to Camp Blanning, I said, where's

17:13.148 --> 17:18.394
the unit? They said, Carolina on maneuvers. I 
said, well, I better join them. And this colonel,

17:22.678 --> 17:28.204
he said, no, Lieutenant, we're really happy to see 
you because I need you to help me here. So we got the

17:28.224 --> 17:33.490
inventory of all this equipment, turned it over to 
the post, Then we got a load of trains with the

17:34.128 --> 17:44.700
things we were taking with us, you know, from day 
rooms like radios and that sort of thing, up to Camp

17:34.128 --> 17:44.700
Edwards. That was the home station, which people 
were in the field, but that's where they were

17:44.720 --> 17:50.126
going. And this was really something to leave your 
home station to go on a maneuver and then never

17:51.287 --> 17:58.555
return there and go from there. Sure. It was all 
that unfinished business that's got to be

17:58.916 --> 18:03.561
accomplished in the back. So I said, okay, he's the 
boss. So I worked there for several days. Finally

18:11.746 --> 18:14.248
we got the train loaded and I was going to command. 
And we went on up to Massachusetts to Camp Edwards

18:15.609 --> 18:20.474
on the Cape. And I noticed that the regimental 
commander that met the train, first he looked at me

18:21.815 --> 18:29.622
kind of astounded.

18:32.164 --> 18:34.206
And he spoke to me, returned my salute. And then 
turned and stalked off. What's happening? And

18:41.457 --> 18:47.907
time went on, and I didn't find out until after the 
war.

18:50.971 --> 18:58.162
In the book we have here now, The Texas Army, have 
you ever seen that book?

18:58.182 --> 19:03.990
I read in there that when I didn't return directly 
from Brooksfield.

19:09.572 --> 19:12.435
They dropped me as being absent without leave. And 
they had called Brooksfield. They said, well, he

19:15.519 --> 19:17.761
signed out right here on this date. Boy, he should 
have been there long ago. Days have passed now.

19:23.447 --> 19:33.657
Nobody thought to call down there, Camp Blanning, 
and find out whether Andrews was there. So they all

19:34.227 --> 19:36.310
thought that you were over the hill? Yeah, 
desertion. And in the book, he writes about that,

19:37.251 --> 19:49.729
he doesn't name me, but he writes about this 
lieutenant, was the first one that deserted, was

19:37.251 --> 19:49.729
AWL. Of course, they're going to drop me after 30 
days for desertion. They're planning on it. So

19:54.596 --> 19:59.082
they had met at division and said, well, we've got 
to make an example of this one officer. So we're

19:59.122 --> 20:01.265
going to get him the maximum. As soon as we get him, 
we're going to try him. So that's what shocked

20:04.653 --> 20:07.596
Colonel Martin when he found out. And I imagine 
immediately he said, well, guys, that guy's been

20:07.637 --> 20:10.760
down there all the time. He goes, he was in command 
of the train and brought it up here from Camp

20:10.840 --> 20:15.185
Blanning. And what had happened, this is what 
petty personalities can do. The colonel who was

20:23.996 --> 20:31.825
down at Blanning was a regular Army colonel who if 
not an alcoholic, boarded on the alcoholic scene.

20:37.995 --> 20:45.403
He and the division had been at odds, so they kind of 
banished him down there to keep him out of

20:37.995 --> 20:45.403
everybody else's way. So that's one reason they 
didn't call. They wouldn't pay any attention to

20:47.345 --> 20:49.808
him. But it turned out I was never tried, and nobody 
ever even said I was going to be, nor did they

20:51.049 --> 20:56.756
apologize. I mean, just went on. It took an actual 
war that I talked to some people and then saw this

20:57.917 --> 21:03.043
Texas book. Texas Army. So at Blanding, our 
purpose at Blanding at Edwards was amphibious

21:06.875 --> 21:13.343
training. That was a big amphibious training 
center. And you were getting ready for landing.

21:21.375 --> 21:23.257
Now we had our families along with us. Of

21:23.417 --> 21:31.208
course, not paid, not like it is now when you have to 
change the station. At your own expense,

21:31.576 --> 21:34.780
actually, it's got to find places to live. And in 
most, each of these places, planning out, Edward,

21:35.941 --> 21:43.009
we were busy working at night, working day to day. I 
would think so. We didn't see our family very much

21:43.489 --> 21:45.572
at all. You were still, your mission was training. 
Yeah. And so the day finally arrived, actually, I

21:50.257 --> 21:59.507
call that amphibious training we had. And we were 
going to ship out, although they didn't know where

22:01.225 --> 22:07.031
we went. So the family started back to Texas. We 
loaded in and went to Brooklyn to load on the ship.

22:17.581 --> 22:18.222
When was this?

22:21.805 --> 22:22.626
Early 43?

22:27.511 --> 22:27.891
Yeah.

22:30.554 --> 22:35.760
It was one day before our anniversary, so that was 
on the 2nd of April, 43.

22:38.663 --> 22:40.385
We loaded onto a Hawaiian shipper. That's a 
converted Hawaiian pineapple boat.

22:50.677 --> 22:51.498
Pretty crowded. And then joined a convoy. Oh, it 
was a big convoy. Everything had to be convoyed.

23:00.200 --> 23:05.669
That was the height of the German submarines. 
Particularly against the British, boy, they were

23:06.310 --> 23:12.319
giving them a beating up in the North Sea. It was a 
big convoy. I guess we had 15 or 20 cargo ships like

23:13.561 --> 23:20.452
ours and Navy. I don't forget how many you could see 
all the destroyers around us. It landed in North

23:27.878 --> 23:32.885
Africa, near Oran.

23:36.630 --> 23:41.357
Where is that?

23:42.098 --> 23:43.680
Algeria? Oran? Oran or Algeria?

23:57.320 --> 23:57.480
Algeria. O-R-A-N.

23:59.485 --> 24:07.673
Yeah, O-R-A-N. Algeria.

24:12.197 --> 24:17.482
Okay, so you landed there and probably in that same 
month, April 1943. And a ship, our convoy, not

24:17.983 --> 24:23.408
ours, we landed with, and wasn't even aware of it. 
It was one of the ships in the convoy that got into

24:24.609 --> 24:27.552
the Mediterranean. was hit by a submarine and 
loaded with troops. But it wasn't in the 36th

24:32.649 --> 24:33.730
Division. Did they lose many troops? I don't know 
how many they lost.

24:40.336 --> 24:43.279
I don't think they lost a great number. I mean, not 
like two or three hundred, but they lost quite a

24:43.299 --> 24:46.562
few. What was the feeling of the men when you 
landed? Were people eager to get in the war or were

24:49.204 --> 24:52.807
they nervous or anxious? Do you remember their 
feelings and your feelings? Most were agents.

25:00.888 --> 25:06.035
They've described, you know, after Vietnam, 
World War II being a popular war. That's because

25:07.117 --> 25:08.899
everybody was involved. Their families and every 
family had somebody somewhere. And patriotism,

25:12.805 --> 25:16.530
too. Everybody was eager to do their share. 
There's nothing to compare it with Vietnam.

25:23.681 --> 25:27.947
Vietnam's a tragedy, disaster from the word go. 
Well, we get back to this travel log. And when we

25:31.232 --> 25:42.268
landed, then we moved on out a short distance 
outside of Oren. And it was night, so we pitched pup

25:44.632 --> 25:48.658
tents. And everyone, gosh, this terrible odor 
that we all smelled. And when daylight arrived,

25:54.366 --> 25:57.411
the Arabs were standing around there. trying to 
figure out what we were doing, bivouacking in

25:57.830 --> 26:01.455
their latrine. You know, not having any toilet, 
not even slitting, you know, this was the area out

26:03.237 --> 26:09.765
there where they relieved themselves. And so at 
night, how you lined up the tent, you know, you just

26:09.785 --> 26:15.413
went down and pitched the tent. Gosh, it was 
terrible. Well, the next day after that, trucks

26:18.397 --> 26:25.626
came and we moved over towards the

26:30.432 --> 26:36.339
to French Maraca near Rabat.

26:36.359 --> 26:43.207
There's Rabat right

26:36.359 --> 26:43.207
there. See Rabat? R-A-B-A-T.

26:49.495 --> 26:52.058
I said truck, weren't truck, were train. 
R-A-B-A-T. Why did you move? In that way, when the

26:56.217 --> 27:00.241
war is going the other way. Yeah, when the war was 
going east.

27:04.605 --> 27:05.766
Spanish-Morocco. Spain,

27:06.927 --> 27:26.106
you know, was not friendly at all, and they 
expected Spanish-Morocco to

27:06.927 --> 27:26.106
be a problem

27:29.157 --> 27:39.186
And so they moved the 36th Division over here into 
French Maraca

27:29.157 --> 27:39.186
in case it... To control the straits. Control, 
yeah, to be there in the... Straits of Gibraltar.

27:42.849 --> 27:47.152
And so we've been whacked in a cork forest, cork 
tree. But that trip was not with truck, it was by

27:48.774 --> 27:51.076
train. Old World War I type trains where they used 
to call them 40 and 8, you know, 40 men or 8 animals,

27:51.456 --> 27:58.422
40 at that time. chugging along clear across that 
desert-like terrain. So we stayed there and we

28:03.583 --> 28:12.394
also protected, you know remember they had a head 
to state meeting at Casablanca. Yeah. Well. And

28:14.516 --> 28:16.078
did you go to Casablanca for that? Our, our trip, 
our troops provided the security for this big, big

28:16.098 --> 28:21.885
castle. I wouldn't call it a castle, just a great 
big mansion. Did you get to see either Roosevelt or

28:25.789 --> 28:28.493
Churchill? No. We provided security in the 
distance. We had no business to go into. I didn't

28:38.883 --> 28:39.825
have any business. I didn't see them.

28:44.231 --> 28:47.054
Was there a lot of worry about sabotage?

28:50.159 --> 28:56.607
Or was it a secure

28:50.159 --> 28:56.607
area? It was a secure area.

29:01.396 --> 29:06.962
What were the conditions like in Morocco?

29:06.982 --> 29:09.685
Well, of course, Morocco had never been touched 
with a war. So everything was business as usual.

29:14.050 --> 29:14.931
There were some ships.

29:18.896 --> 29:19.897
You remember the French?

29:22.840 --> 29:29.648
When the French surrendered,

29:22.840 --> 29:29.648
they ordered their navy to run

29:31.670 --> 29:40.584
aground, including cargo ships. And there was a 
ship near Rabat that was aground, a great big ship.

29:48.796 --> 29:53.003
Of course, we were eating canned food. And the 
captain was aboard. I don't remember what his

29:54.265 --> 29:56.448
cargo was. Cargo was intact. And he could 
eventually get off. He couldn't by himself. He

30:00.158 --> 30:02.442
would have to have tugs and things to pull him up. 
But he had a whole locker full of meat, fresh meat.

30:11.355 --> 30:12.556
So he'd have us aboard. He had some good wine, so we 
had a good steak. So military life in Morocco was

30:17.904 --> 30:21.229
pretty good during the war. Yeah, actually, see, 
most of the troops Well, they had the palace guard,

30:27.492 --> 30:34.341
that type of thing, but that's the reason we were 
there to provide troops. No, you get on the west

30:35.362 --> 30:41.731
side of Africa, there's very little activity of 
the war at all.

30:46.838 --> 30:54.628
Did you want to get back to the east side and to 
participate in the invasion of Sicily? Yeah,

30:54.648 --> 30:56.250
because we were all busy there. training. We were 
training where you just weren't sitting around

30:59.118 --> 31:02.021
there. But we knew and we had observers by the way 
that went up to the front and returned so we got all

31:02.042 --> 31:13.917
of the gory details of how the fighting was going 
there. Then while we were there also we started

31:15.640 --> 31:21.347
taking these German prisoners. You know after the 
Germans finally lost and evacuated but most of

31:22.229 --> 31:27.756
them captured. And our troops provided the truck 
to haul the Germans, and we had to guard way, you

31:29.744 --> 31:39.434
know, clear across over where they were. We were 
hundreds of thousands of miles, really. So they

31:43.598 --> 31:49.805
had to haul them all the way back to Oren, that big 
enclosure. And our troops would get so tired, This

31:54.584 --> 31:58.287
makes you wonder why we even have wars when things 
like this occur. But the Germans, who were

31:59.168 --> 32:07.476
regarded and felt sorry for him, they said, you go 
ahead and get some sleep so I'll guard for you. No

32:07.496 --> 32:08.356
kidding. But the truth of the matter is that they 
didn't try to escape because there's nowhere you

32:08.376 --> 32:14.442
can escape. You can't go out in that desert and die. 
So you'd actually end up with more troops than you

32:18.786 --> 32:23.730
started out with. Because you'd pick up 
stragglers, some who got off the truck to relieve

32:23.862 --> 32:28.847
themselves or something. And of course, all the 
German troops were, boy, they were good-looking

32:29.628 --> 32:34.794
troops. Big, husky, many of them blonde and 
blue-eyed and tip-top physical condition. Good

32:42.603 --> 32:43.383
equipment. Just when there's prisoners, just as 
if they were right. In other words, the command

32:49.710 --> 32:51.152
structure Of course, you're usually a prison 
camp. You're trying to separate your senior

32:52.902 --> 32:57.109
people from them because of that. But even down in 
the lowest squad and so forth, that sergeant had

32:57.129 --> 33:03.339
them under control. Every morning in the 
enclosure, get up and take calisthenics

33:03.359 --> 33:08.107
together. Everything was done, precision.

33:14.678 --> 33:15.439
And so some of our troops. How about the Italian 
troops? Did you capture any Italians?

33:21.541 --> 33:23.002
At least they didn't come back to us. See, these 
were coming to be shipped back to the United

33:23.122 --> 33:26.626
States, which we did. A lot of them down in Fort 
Benning. A lot of them around here in Texas. So we

33:34.693 --> 33:44.342
finished the training there in North Africa and 
being in French Morocco.

33:47.705 --> 33:49.607
Then we thought that we were going into Sicily, 
although, of course, we didn't know where we were

33:50.144 --> 33:52.607
going. We thought we were going somewhere. 
Because the North African campaign had come to a

33:54.891 --> 33:59.657
conclusion. But anybody looking at the map would 
think it would be Sicily or Italy. Of course, it

34:05.005 --> 34:08.209
could have been southern France, but it wasn't at 
the time. So we went to finally load it on ship.

34:17.617 --> 34:23.405
not for Sicily because other units had gotten into 
Sicily, landed. So we didn't know where we were

34:25.468 --> 34:26.469
going. Were we going to reinforce Sicily? We 
didn't think so because it just about cleaned up

34:28.312 --> 34:30.675
there.

34:33.679 --> 34:40.989
But it turned out that we were going to Italy. And it 
was all the leaders, went to be briefed, which we

34:44.482 --> 34:47.746
were, about going in Salerno. I said, now, keep 
this on. I don't want you to even pass it on to your

34:49.549 --> 34:53.094
troops yet, because you'll brief them aboard 
ship. No need for anybody to know it, except you

34:53.895 --> 34:57.600
people. And so one knucklehead, one officer, he 
came out. Subconsciously, he didn't mean to. He

35:02.767 --> 35:04.890
started whistling, the Isle of Capri. Right over 
the Isle of Capri. Kicked him and said, shut up, you

35:08.996 --> 35:10.718
fool. And so we landed in Salerno. Before we 
landed, Italy had surrendered. And so everybody

35:20.965 --> 35:26.792
was happy that this was going to be a short 
campaign, taking Italy out. But the Italians'

35:27.453 --> 35:31.537
heart, if it ever was, wasn't to win the war at all. 
They were very poor soldiers in North Africa. In

35:36.322 --> 35:44.391
fact, the Germans usually just ignored them 
because they knew that they wouldn't fight,

35:36.322 --> 35:44.391
wouldn't stand. not dependable at all. And in some 
cases, the Germans claimed they were more of a

35:48.620 --> 36:00.656
burden, because they had to supply them and at 
least make out like, since they're allies, that

35:48.620 --> 36:00.656
you told them, yeah, you have this sector. And so 
when we went into Italy, of course, the Italians

36:00.676 --> 36:11.470
did make a bit of a difference, because the Germans 
had moved down the Salerno, especially around the

36:00.676 --> 36:11.470
hill. And they were prepared for the landing 
Fortunately, I'm a company commander now. My unit

36:20.743 --> 36:21.984
was not. I wasn't a rifle company commander. I was a 
headquarters company commander, captain. But

36:27.250 --> 36:29.472
our battalion wasn't in the assault wing. So the 
ones who took the cages were the ones who were

36:32.055 --> 36:35.518
assaulting the beach. So we went on in fairly good 
shape on up to the high ground When did you land? How

36:44.186 --> 36:45.988
many days after the original assault? Same day. 
Oh, the same day, but just later? It just wasn't in

36:48.650 --> 36:50.332
the leading way. Okay. It was still fire on the 
beach when we got there, artillery and mortar, but

36:52.134 --> 36:57.819
not small army fire. Always some off at the flank, 
some on the thing, but not... We went on up to the

36:57.839 --> 37:12.073
high ground

36:57.839 --> 37:12.073
and got the beach secured, and then the Germans 
counterattacked. And they almost got all the way

37:13.235 --> 37:26.729
back down to the beach, but a tank unit was able to 
stop the tank, any tank that knocked out two or

37:13.235 --> 37:26.729
three German tanks.

37:26.749 --> 37:35.959
Finally went up to Alta Villa, had that secured, 
and then the Germans counterattacked and retook

37:26.749 --> 37:35.959
that.

37:35.979 --> 37:39.523
What did you think of the German troops in that 
place, the quality of them? All good. Not quite as

37:42.361 --> 37:46.526
good as those North African troops. But still, at 
this time in the war, the quality was still high.

37:51.151 --> 37:54.715
Later on in France and Germany, it slacked off 
completely. Not completely, but quite a bit.

37:56.538 --> 38:00.442
Older men, younger, and they didn't have the 
heart. They knew the war was lost. How did the

38:04.347 --> 38:11.575
Italian civilians, how did your troops get along 
with them? every village you go, they got cousins

38:12.719 --> 38:17.144
in New York City and Chicago.

38:19.606 --> 38:26.374
Oh yeah, Americans and Italians, I really like 
Italians. They love to sing and eat and have sex. So

38:31.499 --> 38:36.344
many of them, I guess they do. But the action So much 
of my life has been luck. The next action was that

38:43.482 --> 39:03.844
the Germans were attacking the perimeter, and the 
high command, General Clark, decided that a

38:43.482 --> 39:03.844
regiment of the 45th Division, that's the 
Oklahoma unit, would be pulled out. This is an

39:03.884 --> 39:09.270
entire regiment now, between the Salay and the 
Kolo River, would be pulled out. in our battalion

39:09.993 --> 39:12.537
who were replaced. And it was a night exercise. So 
you could hear it. And they had tanks and tank

39:19.628 --> 39:22.273
destroyers supporting them. We did. So here at 
night, you could hear that clanking of the tanks.

39:27.060 --> 39:28.663
All of them were going in a different direction. 
And nothing but quietness. That's what we were

39:30.406 --> 39:32.509
seeing. And it got real quiet. And our troops were 
digging in.

39:40.672 --> 39:43.857
Early the next day, the Germans attacked. They 
attacked us from the front and they attacked us

39:43.978 --> 39:51.270
from the flank.

39:51.290 --> 39:59.083
And Colonel Jones, Lieutenant Colonel, who 
commanded the battalion, we had no communication

39:51.290 --> 39:59.083
with divisions. All the lines were out. Radios 
couldn't contact us. We were beyond artillery

40:02.989 --> 40:05.093
range. All the things that you're teaching, you 
never let this happen. Sure. You've got to have

40:10.027 --> 40:11.368
them in support. Right. Support. So you were like 
on a peninsula. Yeah, I was about to. Because you

40:18.516 --> 40:19.858
have two. But Germans on both sides. Two streams. 
You've got the Germans in front. We've got these

40:23.682 --> 40:24.824
two rivers. But you've got the Germans. One is 
shallow enough for them to cross. And then there's

40:28.748 --> 40:31.992
a road that goes on back behind. So since I was the 
headquarters company commander, this is why I say

40:33.490 --> 40:39.456
I had a lot of lucky breaks. Colonel Jones, he said, 
Captain Andrew, you go back to division and you

40:39.476 --> 40:48.004
tell them what our situation is. And we need 
assistance. We can't get artillery support. And

40:52.948 --> 40:56.031
you can hear these German tanks around here. And 
you can already hear machine guns. The German

40:57.653 --> 40:59.835
machine guns, of course, were rapid. You ever 
heard everybody and machine like that.

41:06.599 --> 41:07.760
So I said, Yes, sir. So we took off with my jeep with 
my driver who happened to be in Caldwell heading

41:07.820 --> 41:17.970
back to division. Well, when we got back near a 
crossing, the German tank and infantry you could

41:17.990 --> 41:29.721
see him was already almost completely 
surrounding the battalion. But we were able to

41:29.802 --> 41:44.700
scoot through that, not on the road, but got across 
on a, it wasn't a bridge, but it was a field, sort of

41:29.802 --> 41:44.700
like a low-crossing bridge that the jeep could get 
across. We cut out across an open field and got away

41:44.720 --> 41:49.566
from the Germans. Did they see you? Yeah, because 
they were shooting small arms, not artillery,

41:51.268 --> 41:58.397
just about some jeep going across the field, 
plowed field. And they were shooting at you? And I

41:59.603 --> 42:04.569
saw, yeah, but not, this is not the dangerous part. 
It comes a little bit later. So I saw a man running

42:06.731 --> 42:10.236
the line, I guess coming out to our battalion, you 
know. And I got down and I said, you have contact

42:11.077 --> 42:13.760
with the division? He said, yes, sir. So he plugged 
in his telephone and sounded. And I got the G3 of the

42:17.664 --> 42:20.428
division. And I told him that Jones had sent me out. 
They need help. They're practically surrounded

42:25.173 --> 42:26.575
now. And I say, they are surrounded now. I said, you 
couldn't be, because I said, you up there, it's the

42:29.084 --> 42:31.687
lake over there. And I said, please, take my word 
for it. He said, I just got shot at. I can see the

42:35.371 --> 42:36.832
Germans right now. And he says, all right, I'll do 
what I can. So then we started back, thinking we'd

42:40.997 --> 42:44.881
go around and get back to them. But then they had got 
complete crossing. Not quite encircled yet,

42:49.966 --> 42:55.632
because there's still one access way around. It'd 
have to be at Alapavilla. As I was trying to work

42:59.240 --> 43:02.324
away, the Germans had outdeveloped. They worked 
their way back around to get back to Jones,

43:02.344 --> 43:11.175
although all we could do is give them sympathy and 
say the message was conveyed. German 88

43:12.136 --> 43:17.342
millimeter, that's a combination ground, 
mountain, any aircraft. And they sound

43:18.724 --> 43:20.506
automatically. They can shoot about four rounds 
without reloading. So it just, boom, boom, boom.

43:26.533 --> 43:28.015
Now, 88 started. like shooting ducks like these 
games, you know, where they run across, we're

43:28.805 --> 43:38.775
going across there bumping and he shot behind us 
and in front of us and finally one hit right near by.

43:38.816 --> 43:41.859
Didn't hit me, but hit the driver. And so I pulled 
him to the side and got in and got him to the

43:43.260 --> 43:47.364
hospital. No more hits on that. So the battalion 
was complete, almost wiped out. Part of one

43:55.173 --> 43:58.356
company was able to get across through the east 
flame to get out. They were the outpost. You know,

44:04.654 --> 44:09.420
tactics, you're outpost for one unit, and then 
you've got the main line and reserves. They were

44:09.440 --> 44:09.901
there. So they got cut off from the main line. So 
several of them were almost wiped out? Most of them

44:16.850 --> 44:18.132
were captured. I see. But quite a few got killed, 
wounded, not so many killed. So there I was, not

44:24.593 --> 44:27.916
only without a company, without a battalion. Did 
Colonel Jones get captured? Yeah. I think he's

44:30.959 --> 44:32.621
still alive in Temple. That was his hometown.

44:38.246 --> 44:40.489
So we had to rebuild a unit. We got replacements. We 
got some real fine officers, one named Denhold. He

44:47.776 --> 44:48.697
took the battalion. He was a West Point graduate. 
And he instilled a unit, a rebuilt unit, with

44:52.285 --> 44:56.990
really a Supreme Corps. And he knew what he was 
doing. He trained. He'd already been wounded in

44:59.853 --> 45:02.837
North Africa when the first was made. Still had his 
wound training. And that showed his dedication to

45:04.598 --> 45:06.140
it. He left the hospital way before he should have, 
but got permission to anybody to come up and join.

45:13.408 --> 45:21.617
He figured his experience in North Africa would 
assist a division that's new and just going into

45:13.408 --> 45:21.617
combat.

45:24.989 --> 45:27.171
So that's the story of the Battle of Salerno. Did 
you know, did you ever get to see Mark Clark? Oh,

45:31.555 --> 45:32.556
yeah. And would you describe him for me? Oh, yeah, a 
real dime. In fact, I got a picture of him in the

45:36.619 --> 45:40.463
Silver Storm in Italy. And I've seen him since 
then.

45:45.968 --> 45:52.053
One time up at Fort Monroe, he came there for me. 
Well, he's a

45:56.275 --> 45:59.538
He's a tall guy to begin with, so he's overlooking 
everybody else. He's got a kind of a hooked nose,

46:02.261 --> 46:08.167
and Churchill named him the Eagle because of his 
nose. It's really not that pronounced, but he's

46:08.187 --> 46:24.983
highly intelligent, kind of a fast delivery in his 
speech, and very friendly.

46:28.405 --> 46:32.288
As you find a lot of them, most of them, very 
ambitious at that time. It's interesting. He

46:35.791 --> 46:43.578
recommended Eisenhower for a job when Eisenhower 
was a brigadier general and he was a major general.

46:43.618 --> 46:45.640
And that was the result of the Louisiana maneuver. 
And of course, Eisenhower was, Eisenhower didn't

46:46.921 --> 46:52.666
ever think he was going to make a general lawsuit 
because he was too old. He was classed in 1950. Of

46:55.449 --> 46:56.910
course, Bradley was the same class.
