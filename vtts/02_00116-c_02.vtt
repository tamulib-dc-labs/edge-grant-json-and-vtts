WEBVTT

00:03.187 --> 00:08.534
I said, I want to live in the back of my pickup truck. 
And I have a camper, and I've got a little bed in

00:08.554 --> 00:14.482
there, and I've got a little cooler that I put ice 
in. And I said, you know, I can shower and shave at

00:14.502 --> 00:21.491
the handball courts because I was playing 
handball every chance I got. And he said, well, you

00:22.392 --> 00:26.157
can't be in B1. He says, if you're not in the 
barracks, you can't be in B1. So he says, I'll go

00:31.790 --> 00:39.017
talk to Colonel Baker, but you'll have to go into 
the H1. I said, sir, that's a married company. He

00:40.699 --> 00:44.182
says, well, you'll be the only bachelor in the 
married company then. And he says, the only other

00:44.803 --> 00:51.230
thing you've got to do is you've got to go get 
written permission from the campus security.

00:52.331 --> 00:57.696
Because when I go to Colonel Baker, I want it to be 
OK. And so I went, and the campus security was in the

00:57.980 --> 01:03.687
OYMCA, down in the basement to the right. And there 
was three people in the campus security. You know,

01:07.471 --> 01:12.818
I mean, there may have been four or five, but there 
was never more than three policemen there. And I

01:13.378 --> 01:18.204
went in there and I said, look, this is, and I laid 
out my plan. Well, I know they knew that this was not

01:18.985 --> 01:22.329
going to last. There's no way, you know, anybody 
would stay in a pickup truck forever in the camper.

01:28.405 --> 01:34.191
But, you know, they checked, and I had never had 
one, no parking tickets. I had not had one incident

01:34.311 --> 01:36.814
on the campus. And I told them I was working with my 
advisor, and I was in the Corps and everything. So

01:44.482 --> 01:48.807
he wrote out a handwritten little note, and I took 
it up to Captain Simmons. And he said, where do you

01:49.788 --> 01:53.351
want to stay? Where are you going to park this 
thing? And I said, well, I'd like to park it in the

01:54.993 --> 01:57.636
same place. And they said, well, and so we talked 
about it. And I don't know if he suggested or I

02:02.400 --> 02:10.567
suggested, but there was an oak tree behind Guyon 
Hall that provided good shade. And so I kind of, for

02:11.108 --> 02:16.512
some reason, would always get that parking lot, 
parking spot. But I parked in Guyon Hall. I

02:18.854 --> 02:26.481
showered and shaved when I was here at the handball 
courts. And I studied at the library. And you were

02:28.582 --> 02:30.065
taking a full course load. Oh, yeah. And I was in the 
core. And nobody came by and rattled the pickup?

02:35.334 --> 02:37.398
No, the only thing that would... It was kind of 
interesting. One January, maybe in January of 67,

02:39.361 --> 02:46.354
I don't know, I had... I usually face the truck to 
the north, but that, for some reason, I faced the

02:47.043 --> 02:51.610
truck to the south. I guess I had a different 
parking space. And an ice storm came up, and it was a

02:54.174 --> 02:57.139
world-class ice storm. And my pickup, to get out of 
my camper, above the pickup, you just open the top,

02:57.720 --> 03:08.477
and then you had to open that, and you jumped out. I 
mean, it didn't have a door. It just had an opening.

03:11.462 --> 03:13.185
Well, it was iced shut. And I'm sitting there 
kicking on it, you know, trying to get out because I

03:13.958 --> 03:18.925
got to go to class. And somebody came by and said, 
there's somebody in the back of that truck. And I

03:24.933 --> 03:26.775
hollered at them. And so they got something hard 
and chipped the ice and I got out. And then

03:34.766 --> 03:38.411
sometimes the parking lot would be filling. And 
what would happen, I'd go to the farm and I'd work

03:43.844 --> 04:01.764
especially in the spring, till, you know, dark, 8 
or 9 o'clock, and then I'd come, and instead of

03:43.844 --> 04:01.764
spending the night, if I had an 8 o'clock class, and 
I'd come back, and it'd be 10 or 11 o'clock by the

03:43.844 --> 04:01.764
time I'd get in, I'd go right to bed, and then I'd set 
the alarm. Well, people would hear the alarm go off

04:01.824 --> 04:08.511
sometime, and I'd hear them say, I heard an alarm, 
and then, you know, you would meet. And my bed, you

04:08.812 --> 04:11.995
couldn't sit up in my bed. you had to roll out of bed. 
If you sat up, you hit your head. And then, you know,

04:15.608 --> 04:21.115
you were on your knees, and so I had a cushion in 
there with a carpet. And then, you know, I kept my

04:21.996 --> 04:30.065
uniforms in there and put my Aggie boots on every 
day and pulled them off by myself and shined them.

04:30.085 --> 04:31.867
Now, you ate at Dunkin'? Well, no. Once I stopped 
rooming board, I ate at the Kettle. which was on

04:38.570 --> 04:42.900
Highway 6, which is now a donut shop across from 
Luby's. But it was called The Kettle, and I ate all

04:43.722 --> 04:51.921
my meals there, and they had a blackboard off to the 
side, and everybody knew that that's where I ate,

04:52.947 --> 04:55.751
and that was my message board. People would come in 
and write me a message and say, because we didn't

04:56.212 --> 05:09.412
have cell phones, I didn't have a phone, I didn't 
have a phone at the ranch, and they could wait

04:56.212 --> 05:09.412
around, they knew where I parked, but they would 
write me notes. And so when I ate, I ate at the

05:09.612 --> 05:16.963
kettle, and I knew everybody in there, and that was 
my message board for a year and a half. Now, as we're

05:17.517 --> 05:26.809
heading toward commencement now, how important 
was final review as a junior? And then what was it

05:28.010 --> 05:30.534
like for a senior? Well. What was it like to wear 
those senior boots officially for the first time?

05:37.963 --> 05:41.027
Yeah, I, you know, that's a good question. and let 
me see, that would have been in 67, that would have

05:41.480 --> 05:45.384
been in May of 67. Let me see if I can find an entry

05:45.884 --> 05:57.856
in,

05:45.884 --> 05:57.856
yeah, it had been, or May of 66, it had been May of 66. 
The year before you graduated. Yeah, and then I,

06:01.159 --> 06:07.825
well, see, because I graduated in January of 68, 
but I was class of 67, so I'll, It would have been May

06:08.024 --> 06:10.948
of 66. I

06:11.328 --> 06:15.454
guess. Let's see if I even wrote anything down. May 
3rd. Juniors are on rotation now to morning chow,

06:23.204 --> 06:27.169
but I intend to... Jumped.

06:31.655 --> 06:32.697
Woke up at daylight. I always seem to wake up at 
daylight. Uh...

06:44.221 --> 06:49.428
Economics 204, still, today's another good day. 
Should have been a Saturday. Yeah, okay, Saturday

06:54.714 --> 06:56.357
the 21st. No, I went to a swimming meet on Saturday 
the 21st. My little sister was an Olympic swimmer,

07:01.423 --> 07:09.934
and she was an unbelievable swimmer, and when 
swimming meets were close by, I'd go watch her

07:01.423 --> 07:09.934
swim. She was the finest athlete. When would... 
very hot saturday the 28th of may final review

07:14.933 --> 07:42.240
saturday 28th of may cloudy and very hot woke up at 
six and ronnie thomas by then was my roommate and he

07:14.933 --> 07:42.240
was on the golf team and i went to the kettle and ate 
breakfast

07:14.933 --> 07:42.240
took bull tech's quiz at seven it was very long and 
tedious but not hard went over to gary moon's to

07:14.933 --> 07:42.240
play guitars till noon and then took him out to eat 
at Kittle. Came back and got ready for final

07:46.669 --> 07:48.536
review. Folks arrived late but Everything is 
okay. Daddy took pictures.

07:57.714 --> 07:59.736
It was real hot, but it's great to be a senior. My 
boots fit and looked fabulous. We went out to eat

08:02.180 --> 08:07.527
after the review, and the folks went to the farm and 
took Jeannie. I'm here at the dorm. Just took a

08:11.332 --> 08:13.094
shower. Final

08:13.134 --> 08:17.059
review, 1966. Summer camp. flight training, 
graduation, helicopter pilot. For some reason, I

08:25.996 --> 08:33.622
decided to put all that at the end, but I didn't go 
into too much about that final review. All right,

08:33.822 --> 08:36.585
now then, what was it like as a senior? How did you 
feel in that final review and commencement? Yeah,

08:43.511 --> 08:47.935
well, let me, the commencement, because I 
graduated Oh, that's right. See, in January of 68,

08:49.582 --> 08:53.987
it was not the same. It was because I knew I had 
another semester of school. But graduation and

09:00.654 --> 09:05.539
commissioning ceremony, Saturday the 20th of 
January of 68.

09:08.843 --> 09:13.548
I parked my truck on the street next to the handball 
court so I would have a good parking place. At 4

09:14.729 --> 09:17.652
a.m., the street cleaner woke me up. And it was much 
like Christmas Day when I was a child. I could not go

09:21.382 --> 09:26.512
back to sleep, even though I had only been asleep 
for three hours. At six, I went to the dorm,

09:27.513 --> 09:31.380
showered and dressed in Aggie senior uniform. At 
eight, I filled out papers and was sworn in by

09:31.420 --> 09:36.349
Colonel Blake. At 10 o'clock graduation began and 
lasted until noon, General Rutter talked too

09:36.700 --> 09:42.246
long. And one of the things, I've given lots and 
lots of speeches. My speeches are all short. And I

09:50.095 --> 09:57.844
gave the commissioning speech here in May last 
year, and it was nine minutes long. I said, look,

09:57.944 --> 10:00.607
just tell me how long it is. And it was nine minutes. 
And I got the Board of Regents. I got six letters

10:06.599 --> 10:08.462
from the Board of Regents. They said they'd never 
had a nine-minute speech before. And I said, you

10:11.968 --> 10:14.332
know, you don't have to have a good speech if it's 
short. I saw Jeannie and Marilyn, that's my

10:15.253 --> 10:23.286
sister, for just a few minutes because I had to 
change into my army greens for commissioning.

10:24.067 --> 10:26.471
Commissioning was a very impressive ceremony. 
General James K. Woolnock, Woolnock, Kornark

10:30.025 --> 10:39.594
Commander, four-star, gave me my commission, 
which I had to give back because it was a reserve and

10:30.025 --> 10:39.594
not a regular commission. They'd made a mistake 
because I was commissioned as a regular officer.

10:43.397 --> 10:45.359
Jeannie and Marilyn pinned my bars on. My mama and 
daddy had the flu and were very sick and didn't

10:45.479 --> 10:49.783
come. I was saluted and gave away a dollar bill, 
which, you know, is a tradition. And...

10:59.455 --> 11:04.643
told everybody goodbye and drove to Fort Benning, 
Georgia. So I was commissioned, graduated, and

11:05.664 --> 11:11.673
left for Fort Benning on January the 20th. How well 
prepared did you believe A&M had made you? How well

11:18.443 --> 11:22.850
prepared were you for what you thought was your 
future? Well, yeah, at that time.

11:32.547 --> 11:44.537
What I think A&M did was, and it may have been ROTC 
summer camp, tied in, but I was confident, but

11:32.547 --> 11:44.537
never overconfident.

11:45.238 --> 11:52.624
I finished all my Army schools, either the honor 
graduate or in the top 1% or 2%. None of them were

11:53.045 --> 11:58.389
hard. Went to airborne school, and I remember I 
went to airborne school after ranger school and

12:02.230 --> 12:20.880
the airborne school sergeants were black hats and 
they thought they were mean and tough and this one

12:02.230 --> 12:20.880
sergeant is yelling at me and I'm a second 
lieutenant and I've been through OBC and ranger

12:02.230 --> 12:20.880
school and I was an honor graduate from ranger 
school. And an airborne school physically is a

12:21.620 --> 12:26.989
piece of cake compared to ranger school. And I was 
in superb condition, always was. And this

12:30.375 --> 12:32.419
sergeant's yelling at me about something. And he 
finally asked me a question or something or

12:33.421 --> 12:38.229
allowed me to speak. And I said, Sarge, I hate to 
tell you this, but you're a rookie compared to an

12:39.150 --> 12:44.640
Aggie pisshead. And he had no clue what I was 
talking about, but he knew that it was not

12:45.447 --> 12:50.414
favorable. And he got so mad, and he just stormed 
off and everything. But, you know, no, I think the

12:54.879 --> 13:04.452
Aggie program and the experience...

13:06.642 --> 13:08.665
You know, just plus my raising. I mean, I was raised 
in the woods. I was raised by a grand... You know, my

13:11.409 --> 13:16.315
grandfather just spent a tremendous amount of 
time with me. And I was always very confident of my

13:16.616 --> 13:24.407
ability to do physical hand-eye coordination. I 
mean, anything like that. I mean, you know, if I

13:25.648 --> 13:30.595
went into a GRE exam, I wasn't ever confident. But 
if I was having to do something where... your wits

13:35.397 --> 13:44.350
depended upon it or your calmness or your 
decision-making or your ability to accomplish or

13:35.397 --> 13:44.350
overcome an obstacle.

13:46.993 --> 13:50.438
I was just confident without being 
overconfident. Did A&M help to build that

13:50.819 --> 13:52.702
confidence? Well, I think it was the whole 
program. I was very gifted to have a wonderful

13:55.946 --> 14:02.215
family that kind of... you know, kind of continued 
along with A&M. And then I think A&M just because

14:07.222 --> 14:10.382
of... of all the experiences and the traditions 
that you put in in such an important period of your

14:10.835 --> 14:17.763
life. And it was very disciplined. I mean, A&M was a 
very disciplined place, and I liked that. And so I

14:24.472 --> 14:27.275
think it just fit very well for me. It was one of 
those things, like I tell folks, the Army's not for

14:27.595 --> 14:32.682
everybody, but for some people it's perfect. And 
A&M's not for everybody, but for some people it's

14:32.722 --> 14:36.426
just perfect. And it was... I was a... I was a rebel 
without being a troublemaker. I wasn't a

14:41.761 --> 14:43.343
follower. I would not just do things because I 
thought through things. And A&M, the whole

14:52.034 --> 14:58.341
experience lets you figure all that out for 
yourself. This Aggie spirit that all of us refer

14:58.361 --> 15:05.490
to, what is it, what makes it, and why is it 
important? I saw that... in your paper and I've

15:07.720 --> 15:22.938
been thinking about it because I've read where 
some very gifted people have written some really

15:07.720 --> 15:22.938
neat things about what the Aggie spirit means to 
them. What it means to me is things like, is the

15:25.621 --> 15:34.251
personal, aspects of things happening like 
silver taps where my brother's not an Aggie and he

15:35.125 --> 16:02.550
comes and it's his son and he's in an unbelievable 
grieving state and there's something occurs at 8

15:35.125 --> 16:02.550
a.m. that doesn't occur any place else in the world 
and he is a non-Aggie, feels it and to this day

15:35.125 --> 16:02.550
you know just it's he talks about it every once in a 
while he'll never forget it It's just all the

16:02.632 --> 16:14.105
experiences I get with Bear Pickivance, who's 
coming here in September and is a great friend.

16:14.125 --> 16:15.186
He's worked for me twice. I've known him since 
1964. Every once in a while, we would be wrestling

16:16.988 --> 16:28.521
with a very difficult issue in the Pacific Ocean 
that was political, hot potato. soldier, sailor,

16:29.378 --> 16:31.843
airman, Marines lives at stake. I mean, some tough 
issues. And he would grin at me and he says, you

16:33.286 --> 16:38.778
know, if two Aggies can't figure this out, it can't 
be figured out. And it would kind of break the ice,

16:38.818 --> 16:47.015
you know, and it was just, you know, and Pat Gamble 
was the PACAF commander at the time. And a couple of

16:47.055 --> 16:49.260
times we were in some tough meetings. And there 
would be a break and there'd be friction and

16:49.882 --> 16:59.692
everything else and Bear and Pat and I would just 
kind of get together in a car and he says, you know,

16:49.882 --> 16:59.692
if three Aggies can't figure this out, it can't be 
figured out. And we'd go back into this meeting and

17:00.313 --> 17:09.102
solve what would be a problem for the President of 
the United States or the Secretary of Defense or

17:00.313 --> 17:09.102
the Secretary of State and we would solve it. And so 
I think the Aggie spirit is just experiences where

17:17.759 --> 17:24.147
you had personal situations happen and it just 
permeates. You can't describe it. You can't

17:30.395 --> 17:33.920
necessarily put your finger on it. It's like a lot 
of things. You know it when you see it. You feel it.

17:41.049 --> 17:44.053
Is one of the keys that it's inclusive? instead of 
exclusive meaning it doesn't matter about your

17:44.692 --> 17:49.925
family's accent. Oh yeah, right. No, because the 
You know, I was at a big meeting last Thursday in San

17:56.167 --> 18:10.423
Antonio, and this, you know, I was representing 
this group and everything, and this guy who we were

17:56.167 --> 18:10.423
meeting with who was Hispanic, he says, is that an 
Aggie ring? And I said, yes, it is. And he said, what

18:12.406 --> 18:13.307
class? I said, 67. And he said, 74. And we saw, and 
from then on, it was just wrapping up the meeting,

18:22.306 --> 18:25.391
you know. And has this spirit meant much to you in 
your life, you think? Well, yeah, I've always been

18:30.139 --> 18:35.809
proud of being an Aggie. And like during Vietnam, 
the Aggies, there was no, to my knowledge, there

18:35.969 --> 18:47.368
was no,

18:35.969 --> 18:47.368
I mean, I've, I've read a lot. I've read Vannevar's 
book on Johnson wars, and I've read a lot about the

18:48.648 --> 18:56.800
decision making for Vietnam. And if I were king and 
could relive it again, we wouldn't have gotten

18:57.842 --> 19:02.529
involved. But we were involved. Soldiers were 
dying. Other schools in the Southwest Conference

19:09.238 --> 19:13.845
were picketing, were having demonstrations. And 
if you were in ROTC at Texas University, you

19:14.652 --> 19:25.023
couldn't wear your uniform out of the ROTC 
building there at Texas. None of that happened at

19:25.844 --> 19:28.287
A&M.

19:31.750 --> 19:42.702
When Clinton talks about how he agonized over the 
Vietnam War, and that was part of his

19:31.750 --> 19:42.702
decision-making on some of the decisions he made, 
Coming from A&M, with the traditions of the

19:43.610 --> 20:00.033
Aggies,

19:43.610 --> 20:00.033
whether or not it was a just war, it was America's 
war, and Aggies were going to go do their duty to God

19:43.610 --> 20:00.033
and country. They weren't going to have these 
intellectual... you know, debates on things, at

20:04.872 --> 20:09.217
least at the time. I mean, there's a time for 
debating and there's a time for action. And I was

20:12.201 --> 20:18.749
always proud of A&M, you know, just because it 
seemed to have been able to sort through those

20:12.201 --> 20:18.749
things. And then subsequently has done some great 
analysis and some great work. And, you know, and as

20:26.218 --> 20:33.867
I think all of us, you know, would say, you know, you 
know may have been something that we didn't need

20:35.213 --> 21:02.605
you know communism could have fallen Soviet Union 
could have fallen probably without Vietnam we'll

20:35.213 --> 21:02.605
never know but no the whole everything I've

20:35.213 --> 21:02.605
always been very proud to be an Aggie and when 
Jeannie decided to come back to College Station or

20:35.213 --> 21:02.605
come to College Station to live I just thought it 
was a wonderful fit to be able to come home because

20:35.213 --> 21:02.605
there's a comfort There's a comfort level in this 
part of Texas. So you think A&M has been a

21:07.322 --> 21:11.850
significant factor in your life? Yeah.

21:19.683 --> 21:22.207
There's just no doubt about it. I was just turned 18 
when I got here. and I left at just turning 22. So

21:31.504 --> 21:36.574
it's that formative stages of your life, and a lot 
of bad things can happen. Because there was a lot of

21:38.017 --> 21:45.433
bad things happening at other universities, and 
they just weren't happening here. There was

21:45.573 --> 21:46.395
still... you know, a very doing things right, 
honorable. All those things were things that

21:53.830 --> 21:57.415
meant something. All right. Now the consultant 
question. You've just been selected as a

22:00.279 --> 22:06.328
consultant to A&M's leadership regarding the 
future of A&M. What advice would you give A&M to do

22:07.069 --> 22:11.174
and or not to do? Uh... I've given five speeches at 
A&M in the last 10 years. And in all five of them, I'm

22:20.292 --> 22:34.829
not sure if they have been positively received by 
everyone, but I have gotten letters back from

22:20.292 --> 22:34.829
many. And

22:34.869 --> 22:44.260
what I tell people is you have to watch the balance 
of things. And it's just like trying to make the

22:45.455 --> 22:50.842
bonfire bigger every year. I

22:50.862 --> 22:57.690
don't think that's a balanced way of looking at 
things. I've been a real proponent of the Parsons

22:58.711 --> 23:01.034
Cavalry. I'm an equestrian. I've really loved 
what they've done. But when they were running off

23:03.637 --> 23:06.180
all their women, Well, the equestrian term is a 
seat. Does that person have a good seat? Women are

23:15.364 --> 23:17.346
the finest riders there are. My little sister is 
the finest equestrian I know. But they had a rites

23:23.574 --> 23:28.941
of passage out there where they had to chew 
tobacco. Well, that ran off a bunch of women, and

23:28.961 --> 23:32.925
they lost a bunch of wonderful equestrians. So I 
tell the Aggies, I said, You know, your strength

23:37.733 --> 23:41.619
also sometimes is your weakness. Our strength is 
our weakness. Our strength is our zealous

23:43.662 --> 23:48.509
love of the school. It's also our weakness. And 
we've got to balance life, and you have to balance

23:51.554 --> 24:02.150
your family, your God, your profession, your 
school, and you've got to keep things in balance.

24:02.170 --> 24:03.572
And you just can't... You know, we've got liberals 
and we've got conservatives, but have you ever

24:04.548 --> 24:10.621
heard of a plane flying with only one wing? Planes 
fly because they have two wings. And as life is

24:14.228 --> 24:25.712
tough out there, and the folks that I've seen that 
have made the greatest contributions to our

24:14.228 --> 24:25.712
society There was a fervor about them, but there 
was a balance in their life. And I said, you know,

24:32.068 --> 24:34.512
that would be my counsel. Yes, darling. Okay, 
right. We've got to go to a dinner party here in a

24:37.217 --> 24:39.140
little while. We're about through. We're within 
ten minutes. We're about through. If you'll just

24:44.069 --> 24:46.553
lay out my cloak. Okay, if you could make a major 
gift, somebody walks up and hands you a check for a

24:46.972 --> 25:04.232
million dollars, but the stipulation is you must 
pass it on to A&M, but you decide the use of the

24:46.972 --> 25:04.232
money, what would you want A&M to do with a major 
gift if you were the decision maker? Well, because

25:05.233 --> 25:15.865
I have been in programatics, especially the last 
15 years, where I've managed large amount of money

25:16.638 --> 25:43.793
uh...

25:16.638 --> 25:43.793
i have some strong feelings about that and what i 
would do is is i would give it to the president to use

25:16.638 --> 25:43.793
as he saw fit what happens to us in this world is 
we're provided the congress gives department of

25:16.638 --> 25:43.793
defense monies but says generals this is where you 
will spend it You will build these ships in my

25:44.026 --> 25:48.571
district, and you will do this, and you will do 
that. And so the discretionary funds that the

25:49.472 --> 25:58.881
leadership has at the senior levels is very 
limited because you get all this fenced money.

26:00.263 --> 26:13.476
Well, when I watch what's happening at A&M, and I 
think of, and I know Ray Bowen, and I greatly

26:00.263 --> 26:13.476
respect him, and I'm sure that I'll respect the 
next president, to me what he needs... is the

26:14.148 --> 26:18.336
latitude to make decisions, and he's got a lot of 
help. He's got a lot of people to look over his

26:18.356 --> 26:20.080
shoulder. So if I was going to give an endowment, I 
would go to the president and say, you know, where

26:20.100 --> 26:30.040
do you need this money? Where is there a need? 
Because it may be you know, the Sterling Library

26:34.128 --> 26:38.372
has enough. It may be that this program has enough, 
and if you fenced it, that wouldn't help him. And so

26:45.159 --> 27:01.536
I think because I've had, I've been at the end of a 
lot of fenced money where I, as a leader, knew where

26:45.159 --> 27:01.536
I needed it, and I couldn't because of legislation 
or other regulations put it there, I would want it

26:45.159 --> 27:01.536
unfeathered, you know, to where... where the 
leader could, at the time, the guy that's

27:02.073 --> 27:08.430
responsible could put it to the best use. Are there 
some A&M related people to whom you feel deep

27:09.393 --> 27:16.352
personal debts of gratitude? Well, I've referred 
several times to this captain and now Lieutenant

27:16.906 --> 27:25.436
Colonel Jim Simmons, who is still a wonderful 
friend. And when he finished his career in the

27:26.697 --> 27:36.689
military, he, for 20-plus years now, has been 
teaching junior ROTC at St. Joe, Missouri. And he

27:38.030 --> 27:40.933
promoted me to major. He was at my brigadier 
general's ceremony. promotion ceremony. And

27:48.428 --> 27:58.886
there was a couple of times where I went to him and he 
really gave me wonderful advice. And sage advice.

28:01.550 --> 28:03.193
He didn't give me the party line. He figured out 
that I was an individual who was a little different

28:03.773 --> 28:11.466
than other people. And I felt always took that 
difference into consideration and tried to put a

28:12.155 --> 28:21.424
positive spin on it. I'm not sure what would have, a 
couple of times, which way I would have gone, you

28:22.425 --> 28:30.793
know, because it was a great disappointment when I 
did not get in vet school. I mean, if your whole life

28:31.093 --> 28:38.280
all you want to do is be a vet, you don't want to be an 
engineer, you don't want to be a doctor, you just

28:31.093 --> 28:38.280
want to be a horse doctor. And then all of a sudden 
the cards are there and you're not going to be a vet,

28:39.357 --> 28:46.324
at least not in the near term. You know, and Jim 
Simmons, Captain, later Lieutenant Colonel Jim

28:48.466 --> 29:00.037
Simmons, was a great friend and confidant and 
someone that I could go to. And I'm the kind of guy

29:00.558 --> 29:06.784
that just doesn't bear my soul, you know, wouldn't 
bear my soul to many people. I mean, I saw most of

29:06.804 --> 29:08.706
the... you know, most of the problems I solved 
myself, you know, and I, and so I didn't seek a lot of

29:09.631 --> 29:16.199
counsel. I thought Dr. Romaine gave me good 
counsel. Uh, and, uh, and then, uh, and later Dr.

29:20.445 --> 29:36.165
Wooten, uh, matter of fact, Dr. Wooten helped me 
get a very good summer job the summer of 67 in the

29:20.445 --> 29:36.165
crop reporting service that really was, was a, was 
a very helpful to me. And he orchestrated that.

29:38.468 --> 29:39.469
And, and, um, You know, and what I always, what I try 
to do is it is easy to take care and take interest in

29:40.208 --> 30:00.871
the superstars and to do the disciplinary things 
you have to do with the troublemakers. But there's

30:01.652 --> 30:09.000
a huge mass in the middle that doesn't cause any 
problems and a lot of them are late bloomers. And a

30:09.503 --> 30:11.965
lot of them are just there. And what I try to do as an 
Army officer was to focus on that group in the

30:12.646 --> 30:25.519
middle and to coach, teach, and mentor and try to, 
because the superstars are gonna make it without

30:12.646 --> 30:25.519
any help. The troublemakers, you're gonna 
discipline according to the Uniform Code of

30:26.280 --> 30:32.286
Military Justice or what are the rules and 
regulations. But where you really build the great

30:33.026 --> 30:37.671
teams of teams is in the middle. And I think because 
I was in the middle and because some of these guys

30:38.073 --> 30:58.726
figured that out and

30:38.073 --> 30:58.726
gave me good counsel, it provided the role models 
for me for 33 years to kind of do the same. Have we

30:59.708 --> 31:02.292
left any topics out that we should have covered? 
Let me just check my notes right quick. Because

31:06.627 --> 31:08.269
I've only got one question left. Okay, sir. I told 
athlete

31:09.030 --> 31:22.712
Randy Mattson, no bonfire. Wall Street Journal, 
security concussions. Oh, I had a third

31:25.276 --> 31:29.022
concussion of my fourth was that as a fish playing 
hall hockey, and hall hockey was illegal. And I was

31:34.024 --> 31:40.855
knocked cold on the radiator in dorm 17. And when I 
woke up in the clinic, one of my upper class
