00:01.550 --> 00:05.462
Mrs. Dona Coulter Carnes on March 24, 1975. Ms. 
Dona is 96 years old and lives on the same property

00:07.068 --> 00:15.053
that her parents did, 502 East 26th in Bryan.

00:44.783 --> 00:57.881
The town, when the people were beginning to find 
out that there was a new town opened up, they

00:44.783 --> 00:57.881
commenced to come to make themselves citizens. 
And my father came as a young boy, a horseback from

00:58.882 --> 01:14.183
Nashville, Arkansas, to be one of the younger men 
of our town. And my mother came all the way from

01:16.747 --> 01:31.912
Nashville, Tennessee with her father and mother 
to Texas to find another home that they thought was

01:16.747 --> 01:31.912
nicer than where they came from. And my father fell 
in love with my mother and they were married. My

01:38.943 --> 01:39.985
mother was raised by Dr. H.T. Downard, and he was 
the first mayor of Bryan, Texas.

01:54.454 --> 02:02.644
And he was one of the most active citizens that we 
had because when he came, there was no school. And

02:04.507 --> 02:07.170
he sent all the way with his own money to 
Louisville, Kentucky, from where his wife's

02:07.808 --> 02:27.425
people came from, and started a little neighbor 
school over what we call now Washington Avenue,

02:07.808 --> 02:27.425
and which is now used as a gas station. But he paid 
for the schoolteacher and kept her in his home all

02:27.946 --> 02:37.714
that time.

02:38.032 --> 02:48.287
was like most all the other little new towns, the 
merchants all bought their business houses

02:38.032 --> 02:48.287
around the courthouse. You'll see that in 
traveling all over Texas and the new states, that

02:48.948 --> 02:56.479
that's the way they did. It's over that way in 
Caldwell. But

02:59.883 --> 03:06.553
whoever started that was doing it for the almighty 
dollar and to get rich quick. So the people who

03:11.351 --> 03:18.317
wanted to buy buildings and put up buildings 
didn't like that. So that's the reason we have Main

03:18.397 --> 03:22.682
Street downtown Brian. Now, you never have seen 
any of the stores until recently where one of them

03:23.082 --> 03:32.050
has been around the courthouse. And my father came 
here because his sister had married Colonel P.R.

03:40.832 --> 03:52.109
Smith, who was one of the early merchants here in 
town, and built a store down on Main Street. And

03:53.871 --> 04:00.621
then my father clicked for him, and P.R. Smith was 
beginning to have a little trouble financially,

04:00.641 --> 04:05.008
and that was hurting my father also because he had 
borrowed some of my father's money left from the

04:05.731 --> 04:15.304
estate, the Coulter estate in Arkansas. So my 
mother says, now, don't you be discouraged if you

04:16.105 --> 04:25.617
don't get what $100, $50 is going in the bank. And we 
are going to amount to something in this little

04:25.637 --> 04:28.561
town. And whatever his salary was, she took half of 
that money and put it in the bank. And we, my father,

04:38.028 --> 04:49.990
after the first child was born, bought this piece 
of property here, the whole entire block of

04:38.028 --> 04:49.990
ground. And he kept it that way because everybody 
had to look after a way to travel. And my father had a

04:57.063 --> 04:58.806
horse. and a buggy, and we had the finest milk cow 
that anybody could possibly buy. And we had plenty

05:04.675 --> 05:14.828
of chickens and guineas and ducks and gardens and 
everything that it takes to make a happy home. And

05:15.730 --> 05:17.913
we had a happy home. I guess one of the most 
enjoyable, prosperous families that you could

05:18.453 --> 05:27.105
find anywhere. And so my father soon had enough 
money saved up that he bought the dry goods store

05:28.148 --> 05:44.714
from his brother-in-law and a friend of his. They 
were in together. Mr. Bowers was the name. Bowers

05:48.480 --> 05:50.282
and P.R. Smith. And my father bought. their 
interest and so his business kept growing and

05:56.768 --> 06:15.132
growing and growing and my mother kept saving and 
saving and saving and finally they got enough

05:56.768 --> 06:15.132
money that they bought the building that the 
business was in which was a brick building. All of

06:16.462 --> 06:22.209
Main Street was in deep sand, very deep sand. And it 
was made extremely wide, much wider than any

06:22.769 --> 06:30.198
country town that you could see has. And that was 
due to the ox teams that people would come. They'd

06:37.767 --> 06:46.317
drive oxen to their farm wagons and come in, and 
they'd be parked right out on Main Street We have a

06:47.107 --> 06:53.533
picture that shows that where all of the people are 
gathered. And then finally, as time went by, a club

06:54.635 --> 07:01.421
was organized. And from this club, they put just 
one standard of lights down Main Street for every

07:02.042 --> 07:11.872
block that they had. They had two lights, one on in 
the section of East Street. And so it wasn't long

07:19.801 --> 07:42.257
until they began to, each merchant began to 
improve their buildings, and in all of the stores,

07:19.801 --> 07:42.257
they were all exactly alike, they had three 
openings, three doors, and to each entrance was

07:19.801 --> 07:42.257
two doors. I made six doors for this whole entire 
store. There was no show windows at all.

07:50.536 --> 07:52.539
Absolutely nothing of that kind. And every, every 
year store had these three exactly alike. And

07:59.488 --> 08:10.742
finally, a man by the name of copy who had the 
hardware store put up a very lovely, fancy

07:59.488 --> 08:10.742
decorated building. And one by one, various ones 
would add a little bit more to make his building

08:11.853 --> 08:21.468
just very attractive in every way. We had no cement 
sidewalks. No, the street, the sidewalks

08:26.195 --> 08:31.563
downtown was out of wooden plank.

08:34.928 --> 08:40.577
And the women in those days wore long dresses. down 
to their ankles. You never saw a woman go in a shoe

08:43.291 --> 08:48.378
store and try on a pair of shoes. She wouldn't dare 
to sit down in the chair and let a man try her shoes on

08:49.099 --> 08:56.510
her. There's two things that she always took home 
to try on, and that was her shoes and her corset. She

09:06.544 --> 09:07.645
never allowed anybody to help. In fact, there was 
no place to have it. We had no dressing rooms for any

09:12.276 --> 09:19.767
of the stores at all in those days. My father had a 
little show window that he got when he

09:20.629 --> 09:36.433
went to market one day, one year, and he took two men 
to lift it, and he'd put women's hats in there maybe

09:36.886 --> 10:04.463
and show one week and next week he'd have his shoes 
and the next week he'd have something else in this

09:36.886 --> 10:04.463
one little show window but it had to be packed out by 
two of the clerks and put in the wall of one of the

09:36.886 --> 10:04.463
doors you know where the three doors all come 
together We had no electric lights, all swinging

10:06.181 --> 10:12.310
lamps and wall lamps. And of course, that was a 
thing that the clerks traded more than anything

10:13.572 --> 10:28.194
else to keep these lamps and the chimneys washed 
and keep them filled with kerosene oil to be ready

10:13.572 --> 10:28.194
for business the next day. And

10:28.234 --> 10:33.522
we only had one school building. And that was a very 
large building and a very pretty building, I

10:34.514 --> 10:39.579
thought. And they added, finally added, when I was 
about eight years old, they added two sides that

10:40.600 --> 10:54.132
each side took care of two grades, one downstairs 
and one upstairs. And

10:55.734 --> 11:02.800
there was only 10 grades. And we thought we had 
mighty fine school teachers. And the man in charge

11:08.178 --> 11:14.405
was Major Banks. And he was a very fine, educated 
man. And so we thought it was very fine. And then,

11:22.714 --> 11:27.439
too, the churches were very good in the community. 
The Methodist Church is where it is now. and the

11:33.728 --> 11:39.535
ground was given to us by the H and T C railroad. And 
then they took up a collection and built a wooden

11:41.017 --> 11:55.775
church there, which was always a joy to our family 
because we loved the church work. My mother was a

11:55.996 --> 12:00.842
charter member of the church. My father was not a, 
Methodists at that time. His family were Baptist

12:05.741 --> 12:07.723
people. But he went on to the Methodist church and 
worked in the church Sunday school and the church

12:08.204 --> 12:18.438
proper as it came about. They had things quite 
different then from what they do now. The young

12:23.384 --> 12:32.777
people had what we called an Epworth League that we 
did our Christian work together. in and it was very

12:33.263 --> 13:02.359
wonderful and and it brought us very close 
together too because everybody knew everybody

12:33.263 --> 13:02.359
else then in those days and they had a picket fence 
around the church where the people that couldn't

12:33.263 --> 13:02.359
walk and didn't have any way to get there they they 
just walked to church and uh our um Horses and

13:04.904 --> 13:33.983
buggies didn't do very much good for that purpose, 
but there were some of the members who lived

13:04.904 --> 13:33.983
between here and college, and they had to come in 
their carriage, and their surrey, what they

13:04.904 --> 13:33.983
called a fringed top surrey, and they had a nice 
congregation, and everybody was very happy over

13:04.904 --> 13:33.983
there. the situation of the church and we always 
had good pastors and were able to pay them a salary

13:35.161 --> 14:03.598
and they had, uh, uh, branch store, uh, uh, 
churches that they had to go to one, the preacher

13:35.161 --> 14:03.598
did, and he was paid mostly by farm products of 
chickens and, and fruits and vegetables and

13:35.161 --> 14:03.598
things of that kind. And it was all very, very fine. 
And then we had the courthouse was brought here

14:08.356 --> 14:18.686
from Madison, from the edge of town here. And we 
took part in that. I was thinking the other day to

14:26.534 --> 14:30.818
how I attended. the service and the Masonic Lodge 
had charge of the laying of the cornerstone. And so

14:38.978 --> 14:55.158
they built that lovely courthouse with the clock 
in it and the clock struck and everybody was happy

14:38.978 --> 14:55.158
and they could go by that because they could hear it 
all over town and also see it all over town. And

14:55.799 --> 15:00.585
everybody went to church on time, went to school on 
time and everywhere they went they were on on time

15:01.173 --> 15:29.779
and it's

15:01.173 --> 15:29.779
I don't know just exactly what year that they begin 
to spread out but of course I'm very glad to say that

15:01.173 --> 15:29.779
I have lived in the town long enough to see it 
progress from one thing to the other for for the

15:31.447 --> 15:54.990
best of everybody concerned and now it's a very 
lovely little city and I'm glad I've had a part in it

15:31.447 --> 15:54.990
and my father and mother were very fine citizens 
and every house had a fence around it because the

15:31.447 --> 15:54.990
stock ran out and everybody's chickens ran out And 
so if you didn't want it to happen to you, you just

15:55.308 --> 16:05.103
kept your gate closed, and that kept them out. But 
it was a long time before we ever did get the fences

16:05.764 --> 16:13.056
down. And it's so much nicer, of course, than to 
have the stock because it It was just always

16:18.612 --> 16:25.298
hollering, oh, I wish so-and-so would come get 
that cow out of my yard. And they did do a lot of

16:25.979 --> 16:33.326
damage to the flowers in the yard, and we had very 
little grass. I can't remember ever having a

16:33.446 --> 16:48.400
lawnmower because everybody had just a regular 
dirt yard, and they had gardens where there was big

16:33.446 --> 16:48.400
enough But on each block, there was always six or 
eight houses. Sometimes it'd be four little

16:54.578 --> 17:00.044
houses on one half and four on the other or three on 
the other. And that is a reason that we had this

17:01.145 --> 17:13.358
large place to hear, to live on, that we could 
enjoy. being by ourselves and have our things so

17:13.608 --> 17:31.431
that they wouldn't bother other people and i i just 
don't know uh how much longer it's going to take to

17:13.608 --> 17:31.431
make us a real big city but With A&M College booming 
like it is, and with the school spreading out,

17:31.833 --> 17:40.203
there was only one school when I was a child. And 
when I came up and when I graduated, there was only

17:40.684 --> 17:45.329
one school. And I went to Kidd Key College to finish 
my education, which was later terminated into the

17:47.632 --> 18:00.608
SMU. So all of the

18:02.140 --> 18:20.379
Kid Key College students that were coming on that 
year got their diplomas from SMU after it started

18:02.140 --> 18:20.379
in Dallas.

18:23.001 --> 18:25.384
And what else do you want to know? Miss Dona, where 
did you meet your husband? Oh, my husband. Oh,

18:29.022 --> 18:30.164
sure. I met him right here, honey. He came over, and 
with two other men, they organized the Eagle. And

18:38.697 --> 18:42.363
it was up over what we call now Worldwide Store. But 
it was in a store, a grocery store, I believe it was,

18:43.024 --> 18:48.673
upstairs. And so they stayed up there, and the 
other two moved. One of them went to Huntsville

18:55.010 --> 19:01.276
because he thought Huntsville would make a bigger 
city than Brown did. So he went over there and

19:01.836 --> 19:09.463
worked in the same paper that's still in existence 
over there, too. And my husband's other partner

19:10.324 --> 19:24.156
then, he had to move on account of his little boy had 
developed consumption, and they had to move. for

19:24.727 --> 19:33.238
his health, and that left all the double 
responsibility of running the paper and paying

19:24.727 --> 19:33.238
for it to my husband. And then when I came back from 
Kedki College as a graduate and a young girl, he

19:33.939 --> 19:54.666
had met me just before I left to go to school where 
the LaSalle Hotel is now. upstairs was a lovely

19:55.304 --> 20:12.975
place to have opera and hometown plays and 
graduation plays and whatever you want to use it

19:55.304 --> 20:12.975
for. And it was a very lovely place to go to, too. And 
so some of the boys gave three of the girls that were

20:17.242 --> 20:24.933
going off to college a big party. And so that was his 
chance. And he got one of the boys who knew me real

20:28.698 --> 20:37.630
well to make out my program and to put four dancers 
down for him. And I thought I was very popular with

20:37.981 --> 20:46.933
the young man that took me, and I thought he was in 
love with me, or he wouldn't have taken so many

20:37.981 --> 20:46.933
dances with me. But I found out afterwards that Mr. 
Collins had asked him to reserve some dances for

20:48.135 --> 20:55.706
him. So he came up and was introduced to me. And then 
ever after that, we were sweethearts.

21:07.411 --> 21:14.298
So then he progressed along, and that was when the 
paper was just a weekly. It was only printed once a

21:15.039 --> 21:17.181
week. And then after that, he

21:17.862 --> 21:25.709
got out a daily. It was a morning paper. And he just, 
after we married, he had a beautiful bridal home

21:37.010 --> 22:04.468
for me spread this office building is over there 
now and that office building is mine now they put up

21:37.010 --> 22:04.468
there which is very useful for the people lawyers 
who work close to the courthouse but anyhow i we

21:37.010 --> 22:04.468
stayed at home very little because he was afraid to 
leave me alone at night while he was working at the

21:37.010 --> 22:04.468
paper and I stayed over here with my Papa and Mama. 
And as I did for every other thing that I wanted,

22:07.979 --> 22:16.228
because I was raised the baby of the family. And 
I've always been waited on. But that's where he met

22:20.533 --> 22:29.764
me, was in this beautiful opera

22:20.533 --> 22:29.764
house. I'd call it play house.

22:34.722 --> 22:56.123
We especially had something to look forward to 
because every year there was an Indian show that

22:34.722 --> 22:56.123
came here and put on a show and that gave us children 
an idea to play with all during the year because

22:34.722 --> 22:56.123
we'd clean out the buggy house And we'd all gather 
around and have an ending show. And sometimes it

23:01.063 --> 23:07.169
would get so good that we thought the neighbors 
ought to come and they'd have to pay to come in. So we

23:07.670 --> 23:11.754
charged for them to come to the show. And we made our 
money that way, putting on ending shows, copying

23:12.315 --> 23:22.465
after the ones who came from Town to town, I suppose 
they did, because we only had the one railroad at

23:24.014 --> 23:33.067
that time, and of course we didn't have the 
automobile. And I have always said that I was never

23:34.369 --> 23:51.253
going to say I will not ride that, and I will not do 
that, because whenever I have ever done it, I have

23:34.369 --> 23:51.253
told a story, because I turned out to be one of the 
very first to do it. And that is riding in an

23:51.638 --> 23:55.324
airplane. I remember it so distinctly.

24:16.218 --> 24:17.099
I remember two boys that had a little plane. And 
they charged.

24:28.949 --> 24:36.238
After I was left a widow, I began to travel over the 
years. And I wrote the social column for the Eagle

24:36.258 --> 24:40.103
to help my husband. And I kept that for 30 years, 
writing that social column every week. It came out

24:45.570 --> 24:47.873
on Thursday. And I wrote all my parties and 
weddings and what I thought would be of any

24:47.893 --> 24:57.285
interest in the social way. to be put into this 
paper on Thursday. So the paper then grew in

25:07.347 --> 25:15.660
interest and grew in interest. And I got tired, and 
I stopped writing the paper. But the paper

25:22.791 --> 25:24.133
progressed. very nicely without my help. I think 
it will continue to do so anyhow. But everybody who

25:33.803 --> 25:46.796
owned any part in the paper sold recently, a few 
years back, to this company that owns it now.

25:49.678 --> 25:52.861
How many brothers and sisters did you have? I had 
two brothers and one sister. Are they still living

25:56.918 --> 25:57.939
here? No, all of the family is dead but me. My doctor 
brother became, my two brothers went to A&M

26:03.166 --> 26:16.564
College and my sister graduated at Kidd Key 
College the same year that they graduated out

26:03.166 --> 26:16.564
there at 1895. 1805, I mean. And, no, it was 1895. 
1895. So

26:28.235 --> 26:46.036
I was always the baby and the others always had to 
wait on me and and do my school work for me and

26:28.235 --> 26:46.036
everything like that, you know. But my sister's 
son is living here and my doctor My oldest brother

26:53.973 --> 27:05.165
finished at A&M with honors, and he won the first 
Ross Volunteer Medal that was ever presented at

26:53.973 --> 27:05.165
A&M College. He was a cadet colonel out there, and 
he helped organize football. He's famous. It was

27:14.494 --> 27:22.022
organized in 1993, 1893.

27:23.082 --> 27:25.044
That's the year that he went to A&M. He and my 
brother Walter Colter went out there and stayed

27:25.484 --> 27:32.411
and had rooms. And they didn't come home very 
often.

27:38.958 --> 27:45.385
But the boys would come in so often, and I taught 
them how to dance. They didn't know how to dance,

27:45.445 --> 27:50.710
and they'd come in on the 12 o'clock train, and my 
mother would feed them. And then I'd dance with

27:51.415 --> 27:57.521
them until 3 o'clock in the afternoon and drive 
them down to the station. And they'd get the train

27:58.102 --> 28:01.385
back to college. And they only had two dances every 
year. That was the Ross Volunteer and the

28:05.489 --> 28:08.272
commencement. But they got out beautiful 
invitations. And there were only 16 boys to

28:11.115 --> 28:19.583
graduate at that time.

28:22.482 --> 28:28.351
They both were very, very popular students at A&M. 
They were very likable businessmen when they got

28:29.212 --> 28:33.899
through. Ms. Stone, I understand there were 
pretty bad floods and droughts here many years

28:34.780 --> 28:39.707
back. Do you remember? Well, at one time there was 
so many people died during the time because a

28:40.629 --> 28:51.865
terrible Just a terrific

28:52.283 --> 29:06.685
cold spell wind came up with the hard rain at the 
same time that they were trying to save lives and

28:52.283 --> 29:06.685
save cattle down there. While this terrible spell 
came, there were three or four that died from Brian

29:07.486 --> 29:15.017
that went down there. Only I think there were five 
boys, as well as I remember, went down there

29:15.097 --> 29:20.265
together. to try to help save cattle people. And 
this terrible wind, and it was cold, bitter cold.

29:34.381 --> 29:38.667
And they climbed into a tree to protect 
themselves. And the wind was so strong, they took

29:39.528 --> 29:45.956
off their belts and tied themselves to the limbs of 
the tree. And they were all killed, all froze to

29:46.737 --> 29:49.881
death. except one to tell the tale. And that was 
just one instance out of many, many, many.

30:06.884 --> 30:08.325
Do you remember when that was? No, I've forgotten 
what year it was. But if I'd had time, I possibly

30:11.788 --> 30:17.033
would have been able to remember that. But it was a 
long time ago.

30:22.058 --> 30:25.122
And that was before the automobiles came in. If I 
remember correctly, they had no automobiles.

30:32.972 --> 30:38.218
These boys went down on the train in some way. The 
INGN train had just been put in, and I think they

30:39.460 --> 30:44.506
went out on that. And it went right through the 
richest part of it. valley down there and it was an

30:51.590 --> 31:11.421
awfully sad thing but of course each family lost 
somebody some some farm worker or somebody who

30:51.590 --> 31:11.421
lived near them
