00:22.547 --> 00:26.192
This is an interview with Mr. Delaney. L.P. 
Delaney. For a little over 30 years. When did you

00:32.530 --> 00:34.433
first arrive in College Station? I came to College 
Station on February the 14th, 1946. And you've

00:41.225 --> 00:44.050
been here ever since? Yes, I worked for the city. 
until July the 1st, 1975.

00:52.994 --> 00:58.022
Mr. Delaney, can you tell us a little bit about your 
family origins? Where is your family from? Where

00:59.023 --> 01:00.165
are you originally from? Well, I came from Bonham, 
Texas. I was born and reared in Bonham, in Fannin

01:01.548 --> 01:06.015
County. It's up on the Red River, 90 miles 
northeast of Dallas. And your parents, have they

01:11.615 --> 01:14.018
been there? Well, my grandfather came to Texas 
when he was two years old with his family from

01:14.038 --> 01:23.048
Illinois. Actually, the Delaneys came over from 
Ireland. I don't know when, but they came from New

01:29.135 --> 01:33.079
York and drifted down to Virginia. And my clan came 
across through Illinois to Texas.

01:41.180 --> 01:50.251
Most of the Delaney's in Texas

01:41.180 --> 01:50.251
originated from these two brothers that came to 
Texas then. I have a cousin that runs the Sam Raven

01:50.271 --> 01:58.161
Memorial up in Bonner, Sam Raven Library. And he 
got all this. Family tree. Family tree and such

02:02.547 --> 02:05.791
stuff. Well, that's pretty interesting. What was 
your first job? The college station for the city?

02:14.336 --> 02:19.242
Well, I guess it was utility, Superintendent. I 
was in charge, or you might call it director of

02:19.262 --> 02:32.479
public works then, because I looked after the 
maintenance of the streets and lights, water,

02:19.262 --> 02:32.479
sewer, and everything. It was a very small town, I 
think 1,900 people. And we had about 450 customers

02:37.726 --> 02:40.650
at that time. Well, I imagine now they have 7,000 or 
8,000

02:41.913 --> 02:49.302
customers. So it's grown.

02:54.267 --> 03:03.358
What is your impression of the way that the city was 
run then and the way that they run it now? What

03:03.478 --> 03:06.001
changes have you seen take place? Well, the city at 
that time you might say, a poor city.

03:15.287 --> 03:16.769
They incorporated in 1938. And I came here in 46. So 
what does that make you? Eight years old when I came

03:21.857 --> 03:24.881
here. And we had our offices above the south side 
maintenance pharmacy over the south side,

03:26.183 --> 03:32.332
upstairs. And our warehouse was an old Quonset hut 
building that sat up here where the 707 Texas

03:40.300 --> 03:43.984
Avenue or something. So, I don't know, we just had 
one old army truck and a pickup. And we did our work

03:52.712 --> 03:55.274
out of this. We dug ditches for water lines by hand 
and light poles by hand and so forth until we kind of

03:55.375 --> 04:04.383
grew it and grew it. And the city was able to buy 
better equipment. You said that you attended A&M

04:09.764 --> 04:14.051
in what years? I came to A&M in the fall of 1929. I was 
in school only one year. What was the campus like

04:25.769 --> 04:27.792
then? What are some things you remember about it? 
Well, in 29 and 30, The highway was over where they

04:35.498 --> 04:40.345
call it the old highway now or old college road. It 
came up College Avenue and turned into Triangle.

04:45.512 --> 04:52.402
And all of this over in College Hills area, the new 
highway just wasn't here. Even on the south side of

04:52.422 --> 04:58.810
the campus, there was a barbed wire fence along 
Jersey Street. And this was a cornfield in there at

04:58.831 --> 05:03.497
that time. This was the first year that Kyle Field 
was built. They opened up Kyle Field in 29. And they

05:12.312 --> 05:16.358
did away, the Tunerville Trolley quit running in 
28. The tracks were still laying off when I

05:16.558 --> 05:22.267
discovered it. Well, do you think that... Were 
they as spirited as they are now? Oh, I would think

05:27.488 --> 05:29.770
more so. Of course, everything that came in at that 
time came on the train almost. The highways were

05:37.658 --> 05:39.700
all gravel. I'd say from Bonham down here, it's 
about 300 miles. There wasn't 100 miles of asphalt

05:46.648 --> 05:50.071
roads in 1929. It was gravel that got off the main 
highway and dirt. Well,

05:55.132 --> 06:12.550
even up to after I came here up to 1950, we had about 
eight passing trains a day that came through

05:55.132 --> 06:12.550
College Station. Do you remember any... You've 
been here around City Hall or working for the city.

06:24.473 --> 06:36.650
Has there ever been any

06:24.473 --> 06:36.650
interesting elections or

06:24.473 --> 06:36.650
political battles or anything of that sort? I 
think most of the interesting elections have been

06:37.151 --> 06:43.279
in the last ten years. 15 years before that.

06:49.025 --> 06:51.648
Well, it's just kind of old settlers around. And 
like our first mayor, not our first mayor either,

06:51.769 --> 07:01.743
but Mr. Langford, who was the head of the 
architectural department, was mayor when I came

06:51.769 --> 07:01.743
here. And he was mayor for over 20 years. Well, just 
wouldn't anybody run against him. And he did it as a

07:09.415 --> 07:11.798
service to the town. And I'm sure they're still 
doing that, but some of them possibly have a little

07:12.605 --> 07:23.027
chip on their shoulder or want to change 
something. Maybe it's the reason they're

07:23.087 --> 07:25.713
running. You have more running today. And of 
course, the town's larger, too. Well, when the

07:30.830 --> 07:45.946
city was first established in 1938,

07:30.830 --> 07:45.946
was it like it is now, I mean, in such a close 
connection with Bryan, or was it sort of a separate

07:30.830 --> 07:45.946
little entity by itself, would you think? Well, at 
that time, we purchased part of our water from

07:45.966 --> 07:57.939
Bryan and part from College, and we purchased all 
of our electricity from Bryan. Now, the College

07:57.959 --> 07:59.841
Hills area area east of Texas Avenue, Bryan, that 
was even an REA system that serviced all the

08:00.192 --> 08:11.502
houses. And the city bought, purchased this REA 
system from Bryan in 1952, I believe it was. And

08:21.231 --> 08:29.018
they had an agreement then with Bryan that any time 
the city took in land or any area came into the city,

08:29.656 --> 08:39.544
well, Brian would sell the REA system then to 
Dollar Station. And all the relations with Brian,

08:40.986 --> 08:51.274
all the time I was here, have been just first class, 
real good relations. I think this energy

08:51.294 --> 08:59.241
situation has caused a lot of the write-ups in the 
papers now and a little friction.

09:00.824 --> 09:05.949
But I don't think it'll ever be one city. But I'll 
say it's one big community now. I think the

09:12.475 --> 09:17.159
relations will stay there. OK.

09:17.179 --> 09:24.045
Well, what do you do now for the city? Are you sort of 
more or less just a? No, I'm retired. I don't do

09:29.697 --> 09:32.880
anything for the city unless they ask me to. I did 
come back and work five weeks at first for this year

09:32.900 --> 09:41.888
when Mr. Ford had a light heart attack. They asked 
me to come back. So you're more or less kind of on

09:44.010 --> 09:47.233
call. Well, I like that. That's very nice.

09:55.201 --> 09:57.443
You were here in 1946. That was post-World War II, I 
was going to ask you. That was right after the war.

10:04.433 --> 10:12.781
So do you know, like, well, since A&M is a military 
school, would you have any idea? Were the troops,

10:13.021 --> 10:15.763
do you know if troops were stationed here? Or how 
the community would, well, I guess since it was

10:15.823 --> 10:23.951
post-World War II. Well, right after the war, the 
city, grew pretty real fast for a while because of

10:27.410 --> 10:55.105
all the boys coming back to finish their education 
and had to leave school and go and then to the

10:27.410 --> 10:55.105
government help them we had trailer homes all over 
the campus over there in fact they let them do that

10:27.410 --> 10:55.105
and this is when they built a college College View, 
as it's called, and Hensel, and all. They started

10:59.413 --> 11:04.119
building for the students at that time. Before 
that, of course, it was just the boys. Well, I'll

11:11.269 --> 11:18.839
say up until after the war, there were very few 
married students that came to A&M. But after that,

11:18.859 --> 11:22.003
it kind of got to where They were a little older when 
they came to school, and they were married. So I

11:27.035 --> 11:31.939
guess it kind of changed the complexion of the 
university a little bit. Do you remember any,

11:32.080 --> 11:51.518
I

11:32.080 --> 11:51.518
don't want to say disasters, but things like 
floods or tornadoes that maybe affected the

11:32.080 --> 11:51.518
community or affected the public work system

11:32.080 --> 11:51.518
that you had to deal with? We have had several large 
rains on this little wolf pantry that goes in back

11:52.696 --> 12:15.058
of the Redmond Shopping Center that's caused some 
damage to apartments that were built below

11:52.696 --> 12:15.058
down there. They just built it too low, in my 
opinion. Of course, too, they had a lot of pavement

12:22.669 --> 12:35.546
put in, like when those apartments were built, I 
don't believe Texas Avenue, the curb and gutter

12:22.669 --> 12:35.546
was along by the campus. Rain falls on pavement, 
it's not going in the ground, and it's just that

12:36.447 --> 12:45.298
much more for the preach to carry on, and it comes 
down past it. This is the reason we had this

12:46.072 --> 12:50.938
problem. We did in 1950, the winter of 49 and 50, we 
had an ice dam, what we call an ice dam

12:50.958 --> 13:09.379
that drizzly rains froze and weighted the 
electric lines down, and I guess we had 40 or 50

13:09.460 --> 13:17.651
light poles that were on the ground. We had to work 
all night, but about two or three days later, we got

13:17.751 --> 13:23.399
cars back in. The REA, they had some places out in 
the country off for two or three weeks. So many

13:30.689 --> 13:32.692
light poles. College, it took them about a week to 
get theirs all back. It ran all the way down. That

13:39.245 --> 13:47.177
was

13:39.245 --> 13:47.177
quite a bit of work. You know, when I came to school 
in 1929, that winter, we had six inches of snow on

13:48.559 --> 13:57.473
the campus. There was 24 inches at Waco. If we had to 
go to Bonham, you had to go to Waco and back

14:01.646 --> 14:10.683
up to Dallas. There wasn't any cutting across on 
the 29th. Goodness. We'd go home six days in that

14:13.007 --> 14:14.991
snow. Oh, dear.

14:26.528 --> 14:30.874
Oh, does your family, like, do you have children? 
Yes, I had two children, a boy and a girl. And they

14:36.462 --> 14:37.864
were brought up here? Yes. We felt like when we 
moved to College Station that this was the perfect

14:38.945 --> 14:46.395
place to have your children. And, well, of course, 
we both liked that place before we ever came,

14:46.415 --> 14:55.067
and...

14:55.925 --> 15:01.132
Shortly after we were here, we just took them one 
night and decided this was our home. We were going

15:01.152 --> 15:06.599
to stay here and make this our home. They were, one 
was three years old and one four and a half, I

15:06.639 --> 15:15.551
believe, when we moved here. Where's your wife 
from? She's from Fort Outon. She was born and

15:19.576 --> 15:21.379
raised in Fort Outon. She taught school. in the 
second grade for 30 years in college. Oh, really?

15:27.945 --> 15:29.289
But she's retired now also? Yes, she's retired. 
Well, I'll tell you, and this is no joke, but you

15:30.890 --> 15:35.578
don't look old enough to be retired to me. I don't 
know how old you are, but my cousin was telling me

15:35.758 --> 15:47.338
that your wife was, I think she said your wife was 
her teacher. And she was a real nice lady and a real

15:47.358 --> 15:52.327
good teacher, and she's been teaching for a long 
time. So y'all have been a pretty... important

15:55.038 --> 15:58.342
part of the community in one way or the other, it 
seems like. Well, we think the community was real

15:58.963 --> 16:02.908
good to us. We hope we helped some, but really it's 
been a pleasure living here all this time. Well, I

16:13.261 --> 16:19.068
think that's about all, unless you have something 
else you'd like to tell me. I'll be interested in

16:19.088 --> 16:23.914
anything that you'd like to talk about or say. I 
notice your middle name is Pierce. Where did this

16:30.415 --> 16:31.757
come from? Well, you might say back in the olden 
days, most people named their children after

16:33.119 --> 16:47.259
their mother's parents or their father's 
parents. And the Pierce, my grandmother on my

16:47.279 --> 16:54.930
father's side, was a Pierce.

16:56.210 --> 16:59.895
They lived in Fannin County, too, of course. This 
is where I got my middle name. I have an older

17:02.659 --> 17:08.227
brother whose middle name is Seals. And that's our 
grandmother. My mother's name was Seals before

17:10.670 --> 17:16.478
she died. And the Louis, does that have any 
origins? Yes. My older sister was studying. about

17:26.078 --> 17:34.108
Louis XIV, so my mother said when I was born, and she 
wanted to name me after Louis XIV. Okay, well. Mr.

17:37.572 --> 17:43.079
Delaney, you were telling me about a little story 
about Richard Carter and the cemetery. Could you

17:43.099 --> 17:48.545
repeat that just a little bit again for me, please? 
Well, Richard Carter's home was...

17:56.960 --> 17:59.823
out near the east bypass. And just northeast of his 
home, they had a little cemetery, a family private

17:59.843 --> 18:13.114
cemetery, as most of the old settlers had. I 
believe the last burial in that cemetery, which

18:14.255 --> 18:23.583
had about nine small tombstones, was in 1875. The 
reason I'm found this cemetery and knew about it,

18:26.896 --> 18:41.539
Mr. Langford wanted me to go with him one day in the 
late 40s to help locate it and look at it as a

18:26.896 --> 18:41.539
possible site for a cemetery for the City College 
Station. Mr. Langford was the mayor? Mr. Langford

18:43.402 --> 18:46.066
was the mayor of College Station at that time. By 
the way, they didn't use this location. They used

18:50.032 --> 18:54.439
the Methodist Cemetery out on Texas Avenue about a 
mile toward Houston on the right. But this was a

19:00.366 --> 19:03.350
little cemetery. It had a steel picket fence 
around it about four feet high, and it was about 25

19:03.370 --> 19:12.481
feet square, a little gate. Well, when they built 
the East Bypass,

19:14.283 --> 19:24.375
the state highway men who were trying to locate it, 
came by the city hall and asked me if I would go out

19:24.727 --> 19:37.783
and show them where the Richard Carter Cemetery 
was so they'd be sure and miss it with the east

19:24.727 --> 19:37.783
bypass.

19:37.803 --> 19:44.211
We went out there and searched and searched, and 
finally I found where the cemetery was. It's just

19:45.452 --> 19:47.575
the cemetery disappeared. I take it someone stole 
the fence and took the stones for stepping stones

19:47.595 --> 19:53.302
or something. I don't know. And I came in and 
reported it to our chief of police and called the

19:55.220 --> 20:03.872
Texas Ranger and told him somebody had stolen 
Richard Carter's cemetery. This sounds kind of

20:05.694 --> 20:09.880
crazy, but that's exactly what happened. I 
haven't heard any more about it since.

20:14.847 --> 20:17.110
You also mentioned something about...

20:19.503 --> 20:45.274
an epidemic that broke out in the When the railroad 
tracks ended at Milliken and Milliken was a town of

20:19.503 --> 20:45.274
about 30,000 According to their old stories 
Sanger Harris was at Milliken until they tied the

20:19.503 --> 20:45.274
railroad tracks together to Dallas and then they 
moved to Dallas Well My wife's grandfather said

20:46.233 --> 21:11.127
that they left Milliken when he was nine years old 
because it was they had a yellow fever epidemic

20:46.233 --> 21:11.127
there and people just left and shortly after that 
well of course they continued the railroad on to

20:46.233 --> 21:11.127
Dallas and Milliken just is about I would say 200 
people now. Just never has grown back to its

21:13.968 --> 21:17.394
original size. That's right. My wife's folks 
moved to Reagan, Texas. I see. I

21:22.144 --> 21:26.753
guess that's the last of that story. I guess so. 
Thank you.
