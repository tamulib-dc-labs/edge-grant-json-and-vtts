00:04.098 --> 00:22.546
What

00:04.098 --> 00:22.546
is some of your personal background with trains? I 
never worked for a railroad, but I've been

00:22.646 --> 00:28.215
interested in railroads, so I would have to know 
what a plane was. As a small child, I could go out in

00:28.567 --> 00:40.257
my front yard and see several railroads about a 
block and a half away from where I lived. So I just

00:40.277 --> 00:42.819
grew up waving at the great engineer. And I have 
never lost my interest. I'm interested in various

00:46.883 --> 00:54.009
facets of railroad history, but not exclusively 
history. I'm interested in the current

00:54.029 --> 00:58.253
activities and the future of the industry. 
photographing

00:59.465 --> 01:06.857
trains, doing research on history. I have written 
several articles on history. You're a member of

01:07.799 --> 01:13.208
the National Railway Historical Society? That is 
correct. What is this organization? The National

01:14.570 --> 01:22.063
Railway Historical Society is a nationwide group 
of people who investigate railways. The people in

01:22.330 --> 01:26.975
the society are interested in all facets of it. 
Some are interested in diesel, some are

01:26.995 --> 01:33.943
interested in steam locomotives, and others are 
passionate friends of electric and urban

01:26.995 --> 01:33.943
railways. But we all have a common interest in 
railroads. So we all want this large society,

01:39.189 --> 01:48.459
which has a hundred and so many chapters in 
different cities throughout the United States.

01:48.479 --> 01:49.120
And Houston has one, too. Houston has one, too, 
that's correct. How large is the chapter in

01:50.021 --> 01:51.342
Houston? The chapter has approximately one and a 
half members. Are they all active members? I would

01:57.950 --> 02:00.813
say about half of them are active. Okay. What are 
some of the activities that you do? The Gulf Coast

02:04.676 --> 02:09.882
Chapter has our own several river parks. We have 
the Good Cheer, which is the Kansas City Southern,

02:09.902 --> 02:16.808
or the Palma King City Southern Lounge, our 
population park. We have the Verde Valley, which

02:16.829 --> 02:19.371
is the Farmer's Center Park. We have a sleeping

02:19.655 --> 02:27.785
car. We have a chair car, which is a former Texas 
Sub-Civic, 1141. We have a baggage RPO car, which

02:33.872 --> 02:36.956
is a former Santa Fe 3401. We have a baggage car, 
which LeBron McDonald donated to us, which he

02:36.976 --> 02:42.102
recently spoke to me about in Seattle. We recently 
acquired

02:43.094 --> 03:01.173
a wooden boot from an individual that formerly 
belonged to the Compton Railway. And a few months

03:01.393 --> 03:04.497
ago, we obtained a horse car in the same place. How 
did you describe that? A horse car. At one time,

03:06.439 --> 03:07.260
horses were shipped by rail. So I bid race horses 
for Compton. A special railway passenger car set

03:08.040 --> 03:11.464
up these horses. The exterior is generally like a 
large

03:12.625 --> 03:26.863
baggage car, but they have indoors. They carry 
horses, and they have individual stalls for the

03:27.123 --> 03:30.047
animals and facilities for the hay. They feed and 
kill the animals as well as for the caretakers as

03:30.067 --> 03:31.449
well. I see, okay. Well, about what era are these 
cars from? The equipment that we have dates from

03:36.055 --> 03:40.320
about 1915. the baggage car and the most recent one 
was the 1940s. Okay, so I guess that around 1920 was

03:46.388 --> 03:55.036
the height of the passenger service in America. 
The height of passenger service was in the 20s

03:55.056 --> 04:00.582
before automobiles became very popular. 
Everybody had one in his garage before the roads

04:00.602 --> 04:03.685
really improved. They were probably the peak 
number of passenger trains operating during the

04:04.846 --> 04:09.631
1920s. What were the main lines Did they just go 
across the country, or were they basically

04:11.165 --> 04:15.152
interstate? Well, there were a number of 
transcontinental lines. Houston was on the slow

04:23.727 --> 04:31.321
Pacific transcontinental route, known as the 
Sunset Route, which ran through New Orleans and

04:23.727 --> 04:31.321
Los Angeles. We were also on the New York City 
route, which made Houston the Midwest, the San

04:31.341 --> 04:35.468
Luis, the Burlington. through that's connected 
to Colorado. Again,

04:40.375 --> 04:46.921
the Midwest area. The KD basically had local 
services. But in addition to these through

04:50.885 --> 04:56.049
routes, there were a number of local. There used to 
be a rail car that went from Houston to the Port. It

05:02.075 --> 05:05.978
was a lot of service to Galveston.

05:07.645 --> 05:14.711
before they improved highways and roads, really 
went after the gallows

05:07.645 --> 05:14.711
business. They really competed with each other, 
and they were really righteous here to get to

05:14.731 --> 05:23.559
Gallows. They were the quickest. There were a lot 
of branches in East Texas that had either what we

05:24.440 --> 05:29.925
call gas-electric cars, which are one-car 
trains, or even next trains. Just a

05:29.945 --> 05:35.610
. And throughout West Texas, Midwest, there were a 
lot of these little branch lines. The rail

05:41.773 --> 05:44.737
passenger service only connected large cities 
with large cities. It connected small-town

05:45.278 --> 05:49.863
America with large cities and small-town America 
with small-town America. People would ride at one

05:49.883 --> 05:54.128
or two stations down the line to get into railways. 
How would you describe some of the services

05:54.148 --> 05:57.613
offered? Did most people spend the night on the 
train? Did they have dining cars?

06:04.721 --> 06:06.323
At the height of passenger service, I would think 
that, I believe that most of the people rode the

06:08.092 --> 06:13.399
local, the daytime local trains. People who had 
more affluence rode the main trains of the day.

06:18.306 --> 06:23.974
Cheap,

06:18.306 --> 06:23.974
you know, 20th century men did. The sons of men did 
at that time. These trains had all sorts of

06:26.898 --> 06:27.699
amenities. They had sleeping cars. They had 
dining cars, house cars. They had barber shops.

06:31.585 --> 06:33.588
There were libraries that were in the trains. So 
they really were a rolling resource. But we also

06:37.690 --> 06:49.248
need to remember that we, today, may not think of 
them to be very comfortable, since they didn't

06:37.690 --> 06:49.248
have air conditioning on the way to the crew of the 
equipment. They had open windows, and they

06:49.308 --> 06:52.353
deterred the singers and the co-workers from 
reporting to the train. These were basically

06:52.373 --> 06:53.975
steam engines at that time? They were basically 
steam locomotives at that time. There were a few

06:56.138 --> 07:01.707
railroads in use that were electrified.

07:03.053 --> 07:06.859
Houston had a local commuter system downtown. 
Streetcars? Streetcars. When did they phase out?

07:12.928 --> 07:18.536
They began disappearing in the late 20s and early 
30s, and the last streetcar ran in 1940. One of the

07:19.597 --> 07:22.682
problems was that. West Street cars, these ones 
growing, cost them much to lighten the track. It

07:27.980 --> 07:31.843
was so much quicker to extend the bus lines out. 
Plus, once the streetcar company converted the

07:31.863 --> 07:39.970
buses, they no longer had to pay them anything for 
the streets, which they did when they had rails in

07:31.863 --> 07:39.970
the street. So they had all sorts of incentives to 
do away with the streetcar and replace them with

07:39.991 --> 07:46.156
buses. Well, what were the main cities that were 
served by the cross-country lines? Well, there

07:53.003 --> 07:59.471
were certain gateway cities, Chicago, St. Louis, 
Memphis, New Orleans. Trains normally did not run

07:59.491 --> 08:01.533
through these cities. For example, you would have 
New York and Chicago connected with a train. And

08:08.302 --> 08:11.486
once you got to Chicago, you could change trains 
and get on. If you were going to Los Angeles, you

08:11.506 --> 08:13.849
could get on the Santa Fe, go up to Los Angeles. Or if 
you were going to the city northwest, you could

08:13.869 --> 08:19.095
change to the Burlington and go out to the Twin 
Cities. They were basically through trains from

08:20.020 --> 08:28.335
Chicago, say, to places like Seattle, Los 
Angeles, San Francisco, that you could travel

08:20.020 --> 08:28.335
without change. But you always had to change in 
Chicago, in St. Louis, in Memphis, in New Orleans.

08:35.088 --> 08:39.676
There were, on occasion, through cars that went 
through these cities. But by and large, they were

08:39.696 --> 08:42.501
few and far between. Well, I imagine that the train 
rides across country were very popular and

08:42.650 --> 08:52.521
probably the only mode of transportation across 
the country. That's true. As I said, the roads were

08:53.101 --> 09:00.269
not improved, not only up there, but long on the 
trip of endurance. The airlines were just getting

09:01.931 --> 09:04.314
started, and they were fine. You would hear it when 
you grew up in a single-engine airplane. But to

09:08.959 --> 09:11.982
travel at all across country, you went by rail. 
Okay. What were the typical people that were on the

09:14.812 --> 09:18.457
trains at East Town? Were they the businessmen, or 
were they families traveling?

09:23.965 --> 09:26.468
Well, they really were a cross-section of the 
population. They had business travel. They had

09:28.251 --> 09:30.514
the very affluent business travel. Some people 
owned their own cars at that time, and they would

09:30.534 --> 09:39.506
attach them to the planes and travel across the 
country. There was traveling salesmen there who

09:39.666 --> 09:42.390
used trains to go from city to city with all their 
wares. people going on vacations. The railroads

09:45.540 --> 09:52.469
really helped promote travel and tourism in the 
United States. They helped promote the National

09:52.489 --> 09:58.077
Park. I won't give any credit for the start of the 
National Park, but there were areas of the country

09:58.097 --> 10:08.111
like Yellowstone, which the railroads really

09:58.097 --> 10:08.111
promoted. It got other people interested in the 
great national heritage. What was the public

10:12.104 --> 10:15.288
attitude towards trains? Did people see them as a 
thing of the future or just a fad? Well, in the 20s,

10:21.154 --> 10:27.021
railroads were an old, established industry. It 
started in the United States in the 1920s. They'd

10:30.244 --> 10:35.810
been around for 90-plus years.

10:35.830 --> 10:40.075
And they were a big business, and they were very 
noticeable. Everybody had to use trains. But they

10:42.344 --> 10:43.986
had a problem. They had a run-in with somebody who 
worked for the railroad company. Everybody at

10:48.512 --> 10:52.356
that time knew someone who worked for the 
railroad. They were probably the largest

10:52.717 --> 10:57.483
employers in most of the cities across the 
country. How would you contrast that with the late

10:57.503 --> 11:03.530
50s and the 60s? All right. By the late 50s, we 
talked about the depression and the war. And a lot

11:08.990 --> 11:10.412
of things have changed. We have an interstate 
system, the highway system being developed. The

11:14.458 --> 11:15.980
airline industry has come of age. We've gone from 
the single-engine prop planes to the

11:16.100 --> 11:22.469
seven-engine DC-8s. And people were more 
interested in flexibility. They didn't want to be

11:24.231 --> 11:26.815
tied to the railroad schedule. When you took the 
train, you had to go in the train room. You hopped in

11:29.578 --> 11:30.359
the elevator. You could go when you wanted to go. 
You could stop when you wanted to go, when you

11:31.962 --> 11:35.166
didn't want to stop. like any size that you wanted. 
Oh, a matter of convenience. A matter of

11:38.569 --> 11:41.472
convenience.

11:44.736 --> 11:45.757
How about the prices? Is that comparable to an 
automobile trip across the country, or was it

11:45.957 --> 11:50.723
higher? Well, that's another thing. If a family 
was traveling across the country in an

11:51.985 --> 12:00.455
automobile, it didn't cost any more to travel in 
the car than if you put four people in there and put

11:51.985 --> 12:00.455
one person in the car. Obviously, the food was a 
little more, and your hotel may cost you a little

12:00.475 --> 12:04.900
more. The travel didn't cost you anything. 
Railroad train you had to buy a ticket for

12:08.326 --> 12:10.970
everybody. Even with so-called family fairs, 
where one person would pay for a fare, and then the

12:11.110 --> 12:24.108
wife would go for a fare, and the children would go 
for a partial fare, they still would cost them much

12:11.110 --> 12:24.108
more than driving. What role did the trains play in 
World War II? During World War II, the railroads

12:27.753 --> 12:30.497
were very important. In fact, they held most of the 
intercity passengers. And most of the troops that

12:34.951 --> 12:39.457
moved to the United States moved by mail. In the 
time between, it was very crowded. It was very

12:42.380 --> 12:46.506
difficult to get a seat, very difficult to get a 
filming space. The military, the government had

12:46.526 --> 12:53.514
first choice of all the accommodation.

12:53.815 --> 12:58.901
But with people having money in the home front 
again, after the Depression, people had money to

12:53.815 --> 12:58.901
spend. They did do a little personal travel, even 
during the war. between

13:02.997 --> 13:28.110
1936 and 1966 say what were some of the 
improvements in the rail system all right

13:02.997 --> 13:28.110
beginning in the early 30s the railroad began 
converting First of all, the dining cars, and then

13:29.069 --> 13:37.643
the sleeping cars, and the more modern chair cars 
into air conditioning equipment. That was

13:37.663 --> 13:41.128
probably the biggest innovation that made travel 
comfortable. Keep the windows closed, didn't

13:41.469 --> 13:47.258
have the dust, didn't have to bother with an open 
window. At the same time, the new technologies

13:47.278 --> 13:51.525
were coming into play. The digital locomotive 
appeared on the scene. forward-thinking people

13:57.638 --> 14:04.768
began developing lightweight trucks, the 
Pacific Railroad for one, the Burlington for

13:57.638 --> 14:04.768
another. It's a lightweight train. A lightweight 
train makes use of modern stainless steel and

14:06.210 --> 14:17.165
other lighter-weight steels, which have high 
strength. They probably weighed about

14:18.186 --> 14:24.675
two-thirds that of an older conventional type of 
comparable type piece of equipment. What were

14:26.983 --> 14:28.405
those made of? Those were made of steel from about 
1912 on. Before that, they were mostly wood. They

14:35.475 --> 14:37.618
were steel underframes. By the 30s, most of the 
older wooden equipment had been scrapped and

14:37.638 --> 14:44.688
smoked to steel. What about the advances in 
competing industries at this time? The air

14:48.653 --> 14:50.175
service? The air service in Peru, quite a bit. The 
jet airplane really made their travel. It was

14:57.897 --> 15:03.205
relatively quiet and comfortable compared to the 
piston airplanes, and they were quick. A person

15:04.086 --> 15:13.900
could make a business trip almost cross-country, 
transact business, and by stretch you could be

15:04.086 --> 15:13.900
back home that evening. But a two-day trip out to 
the coast and back with, then the realm of

15:13.920 --> 15:22.573
possibility, whether you went by rail or it would 
take you a week to get there and back. So the

15:22.908 --> 15:27.536
business travel disordered the railways fairly 
quickly when the jet airplanes came in. And when

15:27.556 --> 15:38.273
business travel disordered, that meant a lot of 
the first-class passengers, so the first class,

15:27.556 --> 15:38.273
in this case, being the sleeping car passengers. 
So the sleeping car business was the first part of

15:38.293 --> 15:46.587
the rail passenger service that really

15:38.293 --> 15:46.587
saw the effect of the airlines. What was the role of 
the black American? In the 1960s, it was basically

15:52.547 --> 15:58.134
when the civil rights movement took all its 
strength. And how are blacks treated as employees

15:58.956 --> 16:03.242
and as passengers? All right. We have some 
separate country on the Old South and the North and

16:06.847 --> 16:13.195
the West. The Old South, including Texas, where 
the Jim Crow laws were quite separate. cars or

16:17.870 --> 16:24.537
accommodations for the black passengers and the 
white passengers. In most cases, this meant a

16:24.557 --> 16:34.106
separate coach or a sectioned coach where the 
blacks were in one half of the car and the whites in

16:24.557 --> 16:34.106
the other half. As far as sleeping cars were 
concerned, blacks were allowed into sleeping

16:34.126 --> 16:39.431
cars. But as a matter of course, very few had enough 
money to travel in sleeping cars, so they were up in

16:39.452 --> 16:46.999
the segregated coaches. As far as employees were 
going, the block employees were kept in the lower

16:47.840 --> 16:57.996
rungs of the employee hierarchy. For example, 
they were never in locomotives in the air, but they

16:58.016 --> 17:06.188
were frequently locomotified, and that's as far 
as they could look to aspire. They could become

17:06.208 --> 17:11.957
porters on a small passenger train, but they 
couldn't become break-ins and conductors. Were

17:13.422 --> 17:15.084
they kicks in the dining cars? They were kicks in 
the dining cars. They were waiters in the dining

17:16.446 --> 17:17.968
cars. By and large, the speaking car porters were 
all black. Okay. But the speaking car conductors

17:23.315 --> 17:26.659
were all white. Were the baggage handlers 
employed by the individual lines? The baggage

17:31.326 --> 17:34.650
handlers were employed by the individual 
railroads. Okay. Were they black, too? Yes, they

17:37.774 --> 17:38.535
were black baggage handlers. Okay. Do the blacks 
tend to ride those trains often? Blacks were a very

17:44.882 --> 17:47.506
good sign to El Dorado. They stuck with it longer

17:47.586 --> 17:54.816
than most of the white population. I think it's a 
matter of the economics. They didn't have cars or

17:57.339 --> 18:00.524
they didn't have... They tend on to take them from 
Atlanta to New York or something. They were

18:05.330 --> 18:05.991
passionate things. What's the difference

18:06.983 --> 18:26.089
in the black situation in the south and in the north 
as opposed to the Washington state? The

18:26.558 --> 18:27.840
accommodations were great. In the north? In the 
north, they were not. I see. Even in the south, the

18:33.567 --> 18:38.132
stations had different ways to get to places. But 
not in the north? Not in the north. Okay. What was

18:39.935 --> 18:46.122
the public attitude in the mid-'60s and 
early-'70s as rail travel declined? Well, most of

18:47.584 --> 18:51.489
them didn't care less, so they didn't take the 
train. But there was a handful of people And some of

18:54.993 --> 18:59.498
them didn't travel very often either, I must 
admit. It was protest every time I was at a road

18:59.959 --> 19:06.867
point to take a train off. There was labor union 
that didn't want to take trains off, so that

19:06.887 --> 19:09.550
reduced the amount of employment available for 
their people. And all the small town mayors didn't

19:09.570 --> 19:15.437
want to take the trains off, even though their 
people may not use the trains. In fact, they had a

19:15.457 --> 19:19.582
train coming through town for the matter of a local 
price. Did it help increase tourism also? In some

19:22.225 --> 19:23.346
areas it was. It did increase tourism, but the 
tourist planes really have continued to run. The

19:30.412 --> 19:35.159
Rio Grande Railroad only joined in last year. They 
ran their own private passenger plane from 1971 to

19:35.860 --> 19:48.818
1983, and it ran for almost every trip. But even at 
that level, they lost money on it. Let's talk about

19:53.549 --> 19:57.154
Amtrak for a minute, then, since you mentioned it. 
What is Amtrak? Amtrak is a public corporation set

19:59.198 --> 20:10.034
up by the U.S. Congress, the National Railroad 
Passion Corporation, to operate the railroad

19:59.198 --> 20:10.034
passion trains in the United States. In the late 
1960s, a lot of the trains disappeared and a lot of

20:10.054 --> 20:16.063
the trains that were remaining were down to a strip 
of coaches only, maybe one coach and a man full of

20:17.663 --> 20:28.119
baggage cars, and they made all the stops, and 
people had to wait on the baggage express.

20:28.139 --> 20:37.653
And the Amtrak was set up or organized to be a 
nationwide passenger train network.

20:37.673 --> 20:41.238
The railroads had the option of joining or not 
joining Amtrak. If they joined Amtrak, they had to

20:41.258 --> 20:45.865
buy into the corporation, which was I don't 
remember the exact figure, but it was so many years

20:47.195 --> 20:58.186
past the deficit that they had to incur a huge 
amount of money that they had to pay to join. Once

20:58.206 --> 21:01.890
they joined Amtrak, they were relieved of any 
obligation to run the passenger service. Three

21:03.291 --> 21:06.715
railroads, or actually four railroads opted not 
to join Amtrak. One of them was the southern, one of

21:06.735 --> 21:11.419
them was the Rio Grande, as I mentioned. Rock 
Island. Rock Island was the third one, because

21:11.800 --> 21:14.923
they really didn't have the money to join. And the 
fourth one was the Georgia Railroad, which only

21:15.713 --> 21:20.858
ran a mixed freight on its system. Oh, okay. Well, 
what were the circumstances leading up to that?

21:26.463 --> 21:29.786
Was it basically the economy? It wasn't the 
economy as such. It was the fact that, as I say,

21:31.668 --> 21:42.278
these competing modes of transportation, 
primarily the private automobile, but to a large

21:31.668 --> 21:42.278
extent the jet aircraft, had taken most of the 
passengers away from the railroads. A lot of

21:43.220 --> 21:46.804
people say the railroads didn't thrive, but I 
disagree with that. After the Second World War,

21:47.085 --> 21:57.817
the railroads re-equipped all their big trains, 
and they were buying new types of equipment up

21:47.085 --> 21:57.817
until the mid and late 50s, which told me they were 
fine. At that time, a piece of equipment would cost

21:58.518 --> 22:11.573
$100,000 to $300,000 a car, and they were spending 
millions and millions and millions of dollars to

21:58.518 --> 22:11.573
re-equip their trains, which was pithy. And they 
really did. And there were a number of trained even

22:12.903 --> 22:14.864
in 1971. They're still all spit and polish. But 
there were also a number that said, we're losing

22:17.647 --> 22:21.030
too much money on this. And the way we minimize our 
loss is to do away with some dining car service. We

22:25.994 --> 22:27.275
do away with car service. And we just run this train 
back and forth. I coach on it. Did Amtrak reinstate

22:31.599 --> 22:36.984
the dining car service? No. When Amtrak came into 
effect on May 1, 1971, Actually, about two-thirds

22:43.632 --> 22:47.258
of the fashion trains in the United States would 
just continue that day. But Amtrak didn't want to

22:47.879 --> 22:52.066
take them over because they were losing too much 
money. And that's one thing the railroads have

22:52.086 --> 22:56.454
complained about federally, is the fact that they 
had to buy into Amtrak. The various regulatory

22:57.395 --> 23:02.704
commissions would not let them take off the trains 
they wanted to take off. And yet Amtrak, being a

23:03.764 --> 23:16.422
national corporation, they became an operating 
company for the passenger service, discontinued

23:03.764 --> 23:16.422
virtually every train, but the railroad one 
discontinued. What happened to the employees

23:16.442 --> 23:20.408
that were working for the trains that were 
discontinued? Well, by and large, most, all of us

23:21.489 --> 23:29.721
were railroad employees, and some of them went 
with Amtrak. the sleeping car people, the dining

23:30.359 --> 23:41.976
car people, the ticket office personnel, and so 
forth, had this option of either continuing to

23:30.359 --> 23:41.976
work for the railroad or sign up for landfills. And 
in some cases, they continued to work for the

23:41.996 --> 23:47.764
railroad, and the railroad would build landfills 
for their salaries. But with all the trains that

23:49.606 --> 23:57.818
discontinued, the railroad worked on a strict 
seniority system, so it was bumping down the line,

23:49.606 --> 23:57.818
so there weren't enough work for them. for the last 
engineer on the seniority roster, and he didn't

23:59.975 --> 24:04.900
get to work. So the same thing happened elsewhere. 
They unfortunately allowed it. Trains that were

24:11.006 --> 24:18.534
taken off, and a lot of railroads that took off 
trains or train tracks, especially in the dining

24:11.006 --> 24:18.534
car personnel. And I think they made certain 
decisions. There was a big

24:20.756 --> 24:28.564
discrimination set up recently, I think, in the 
film from Northern about a lot of people were

24:29.118 --> 24:32.505
offered relatively low-status jobs. 
Unfortunately, they really weren't qualified to

24:32.885 --> 24:37.815
do much else. But the 1970s and 80s would be a little 
different. The 1950s and 60s would be looking at

24:43.265 --> 24:48.436
how people treated. Well, what was the...

24:54.143 --> 24:59.748
What happened to the lines that had both passenger 
and freight service? Did they just replace the

24:59.768 --> 25:05.614
passenger service that was now gone with their 
freight service? Well, there are only one or two

25:05.914 --> 25:13.241
lines in the United States where there's more 
passenger and freight service. And these trains

25:13.261 --> 25:23.610
that were discontinued when Amtrak took over, 
they just were off the railroad, and the railroad

25:13.261 --> 25:23.610
kept this line for freight service. There's been a 
lot of changes since that. We've had the Rock

25:26.469 --> 25:31.155
Island bankruptcy and this dismemberment. We've 
had the Milwaukee railroad abandoned, all this

25:31.175 --> 25:38.503
western lines, and a couple other railroads that 
were abandoned, big pieces. So there's been,

25:39.944 --> 25:50.616
we've had a, shake you out is not the right word, but 
a rationalization of the railroad system in the

25:39.944 --> 25:50.616
United States in the last 20 years. And so the 
railroads that are left are much stronger because

25:55.113 --> 26:04.483
the traffic that used to move over these marginal 
lines are now abandoned, are now moving over the

25:55.113 --> 26:04.483
remaining railroads. Plus, with the Stigers Act, 
you know, earlier when I said these railroad

26:04.503 --> 26:14.414
freight rates are going to be wet-dated in the last 
several years. Now the railroads, after being

26:14.514 --> 26:21.762
completely regulated in the right since the 
1880s, For the first time, we're able to go out and

26:22.130 --> 26:29.900
set rates to get track business to be competitive 
with truck lines, barge lines, and so on. And they

26:29.920 --> 26:34.586
have gathered a lot of traffic back on their lines. 
And I have been impressed myself. There are a lot of

26:37.429 --> 26:44.378
people that are older, I mean, we're older than you 
think. Not my age. Who haven't changed over,

26:46.341 --> 26:48.103
but... The railroad department has a lot of bright 
young people in recent years. They've become very

26:52.738 --> 26:57.364
innovative in their way of traffic. They've 
captured a lot of the business back that they used

26:58.465 --> 27:02.771
to have in most of the trucks. They hope to get more 
coverage back. Things such as land bridges, the

27:03.952 --> 27:12.883
road railer service that we had back in the spring. 
A road railer is a combination of a highway

27:12.983 --> 27:16.167
trailer, railroad freight car. It has rubber 
tires for using on the highways and has small

27:17.558 --> 27:30.555
railroad wheels, which we put down on some track 
and had a couple together, and it's dedicated

27:17.558 --> 27:30.555
trains of road railers. And all you have to do when 
you get to a town or you need to cut out a trailer to

27:32.177 --> 27:45.294
take that one off the train and it's ready to go, it 
would be a shipper or it was, of course, I practice,

27:32.177 --> 27:45.294
it doesn't have to be on the railroad. I see. 
Another recent innovation we've had here in

27:46.657 --> 27:57.511
Houston, between Houston and Dallas, is what 
DeSoto City calls its unofficial sprint trains.

27:57.531 --> 28:06.163
This is a piggyback train or container train that 
handles only 15 cars or 30 trailers. It runs

28:07.204 --> 28:09.227
overnight between Houston and Dallas. But for the 
two-man crew, the same two people run the entire

28:16.846 --> 28:20.570
run through eastern Dallas. Now, a normal freight 
train run through eastern Dallas requires three

28:20.590 --> 28:26.397
crews because of the old seniority districts. 
These two people now take 30 trailers back and

28:26.417 --> 28:32.624
forth through eastern Dallas. Whatever it takes. 
Before the railroad in the union made this route,

28:34.286 --> 28:43.737
it would have previously taken 15 people to handle 
the same amount of traffic. Okay, hold on, I'll

28:43.757 --> 28:44.878
switch this over.
