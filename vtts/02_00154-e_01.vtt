WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:07.767
May 9, Kerrville, Texas, getting ready to head 
back.

00:14.614 --> 00:25.345
During those years, in the early 60s, some other

00:14.614 --> 00:25.345
memorable colleagues were Charles Wines, 
W-Y-N-E-S.

00:29.329 --> 00:32.232
Tall, thin, reserved Virginian. scholar of the 
New South.

00:38.215 --> 00:59.983
My second year as a faculty member at A&M, I moved 
from the large office, which I had occupied during

00:38.215 --> 00:59.983
that first temporary year, to the third floor 
where Charlie and I shared an office for a year. He

01:01.064 --> 01:01.965
was a Thoughtful kind.

01:07.997 --> 01:10.461
Colleague, although always reserved.

01:13.486 --> 01:15.549
Another Garland Bayless. Whose area also was the 
New South? He and his wife Mary Evelyn became. Two

01:24.604 --> 01:25.986
of our dearest friends. For all our decades.

01:32.050 --> 01:43.544
His work was always marked by deep concern for 
students as well as an abiding diligence in

01:32.050 --> 01:43.544
community activities. Tom Miller, quietly 
effective in Texas history, a thorough

01:45.246 --> 01:55.999
researcher,

02:00.181 --> 02:05.247
sometimes said by the students not to be very, 
quote, entertaining in class. The department had

02:07.150 --> 02:29.698
grown greatly during the late 50s because in the 
middle of that decade, the state legislature

02:07.150 --> 02:29.698
responding to the McCarthy era and the supposed 
threats of communism

02:32.463 --> 03:00.090
had passed laws requiring that everyone every 
student at a public institution in texas take six

02:32.463 --> 03:00.090
hours of american history and that plus three 
hours of u.s government and that all teachers

02:32.463 --> 03:00.090
although who would be certified as public school 
teachers in the lone star state must take three

03:00.965 --> 03:26.179
hours of texas history thus there was a an 
immediate need to add to the department

03:00.965 --> 03:26.179
the appointments during that period for example 
included lloyd taylor and garland bayless

03:30.665 --> 03:38.535
By my third year, I was assigned to an office on the 
east end of the third floor of Nagel Hall.

03:41.759 --> 03:59.220
By current standards, it might seem like a 
comparatively compact place, but as a beginner,

03:41.759 --> 03:59.220
as an instructor in rank, I felt very flattered. 
Under Dr. Nance's leadership, all beginning

04:01.428 --> 04:18.786
faculty members served three years at the rank of 
instructor and then three as, a minimum of three as

04:01.428 --> 04:18.786
an assistant professor.

04:18.806 --> 04:26.594
During that time, I benefited from one of 
President Rutter's

04:18.806 --> 04:26.594
directives. Apparently he had gone to a national 
meeting Where some speaker? Emphasized the need.

04:39.090 --> 04:39.591
For.

04:42.975 --> 04:43.475
Review. Of performance. And reward on a merit 
salary basis.

04:53.507 --> 04:54.488
On confidential.

04:58.493 --> 04:58.973
Standard. Mr Rudder. ask the deans to direct the 
department heads to submit a list during the fall

05:01.891 --> 05:23.658
semester

05:01.891 --> 05:23.658
of all faculty members in each department ranked 
according to their merit performance.

05:29.846 --> 05:30.767
Rumor had it that John Pearson, who led business 
administration at that time, refused to comply

05:31.456 --> 05:47.994
with that directive and earned at least the 
temporary displeasure of President Rudder.

05:53.240 --> 06:00.568
We rank and file faculty were unaware of that 
directive,

05:53.240 --> 06:00.568
but I became learned about it when I was notified 
that I had received a $100 a month increase,

06:02.337 --> 06:18.780
a very meaningful salary move for a junior faculty 
member at that time.

06:26.691 --> 06:30.657
Another involvement which proved to be 
long-lasting was becoming the opportunity to

06:31.750 --> 07:00.031
become acquainted with J. Wayne Stark, that's 
initial J and then W-A-Y-N-E-S-T-A-R-K, the

06:31.750 --> 07:00.031
founding director of the Memorial Student 
Center.

07:00.051 --> 07:01.032
Future future acquaintance with him would 
demonstrate that he was a tireless and always

07:02.463 --> 07:22.824
optimistic crusader for what was best for the 
entire institution. He was a self-appointed

07:22.844 --> 07:31.913
campaigner for the fine arts, leadership 
development, and had an innate ability to

07:33.901 --> 07:48.638
identify individuals

07:33.901 --> 07:48.638
to draw, whom he would attempt to draw into the 
MSC's activities.

07:51.742 --> 08:00.752
For example, if he learned about a freshman who 
seemed highly promising,

08:03.112 --> 08:28.596
He would invite that student to his office and 
after a chat quite often would assign that student

08:03.112 --> 08:28.596
to be the, quote, aid, quote, or in fact errand 
runner for one of the key student body officers.

08:33.082 --> 08:38.547
That would give the promising student a bird's eye 
view.

08:41.810 --> 09:02.127
For example,

08:41.810 --> 09:02.127
a young freshman named Kent Caperton, 
K-E-N-T-C-A-P-E-R-T-O-N,

08:41.810 --> 09:02.127
who had come to A&M in the mid 60s, from his home in 
Caldwell

09:03.001 --> 09:23.285
where he had been president of the student body and 
had earned the respect of both the high school

09:03.001 --> 09:23.285
faculty and his fellow students. Someone called 
young Caperton to the attention of Mr. Stark and so

09:30.912 --> 09:47.949
Under the, quote, Stark

09:30.912 --> 09:47.949
system, quote, Kent became the assistant to the 
MSC, to the student body president. His sophomore

09:47.969 --> 10:00.902
year,

09:47.969 --> 10:00.902
as was usual, he disappeared,

09:47.969 --> 10:00.902
meaning he was no longer highly visible.

10:03.937 --> 10:16.031
because he was working in the, on the, he was 
proceeding at the true working level of student

10:03.937 --> 10:16.031
activities. By his sophomore year he reemerged, 
by his junior year he reemerged as a student body

10:17.934 --> 10:31.530
leader and then was elected president of the A&M 
student body his senior year. 1970-71. The

10:34.007 --> 10:49.282
same thing had occurred a few years a similar 
series

10:34.007 --> 10:49.282
of events had occurred just a bit earlier. Mr. 
Stark and a few others had gathered to try to

10:49.302 --> 11:01.855
consider how A&M could attract more highly 
promising Hispanic students

11:03.202 --> 11:32.010
because it seemed that in the coming decades the 
Mexican-American percentage of the state's

11:03.202 --> 11:32.010
population would grow very sharply and A&M would 
need to have some of its graduates in that

11:32.277 --> 11:43.355
leadership group if the land-grant school for 
Texas was to prosper.

11:49.806 --> 11:58.420
With the assistance of Buck Wirus, the always 
energetic director of the Association of Former

11:49.806 --> 11:58.420
Students, the staff of the Registrar's Office 
Stark and others tried to identify some very

12:00.627 --> 12:19.607
promising students.

12:19.627 --> 12:29.217
As they said, they went after those young men

12:19.627 --> 12:29.217
with rifles, instead of shotguns, and of the 15 who 
were sought, 12 enrolled.

12:37.968 --> 12:55.706
By the time

12:37.968 --> 12:55.706
they became part of the Stark system in their 
freshman year

12:37.968 --> 12:55.706
and were aides to many of the key student body 
leaders. Again, they disappeared from view as

13:00.820 --> 13:12.712
sophomores, then reemerged as juniors as the vice 
president, vice chairman, and or otherwise

13:00.820 --> 13:12.712
second in command of their group. Then as seniors, 
it seemed that they, quote, took over the campus

13:13.633 --> 13:29.629
because

13:13.633 --> 13:29.629
Henry Cisneros

13:13.633 --> 13:29.629
became band commander. and Hector Gutierrez, the 
commander of the Corps of Cadets, the first

13:30.807 --> 13:47.447
minority individual to hold that role.

13:47.467 --> 13:57.760
A classic bit of Aggie,

13:47.467 --> 13:57.760
true Aggie mythology occurred when

14:01.655 --> 14:28.050
Hector returned back to his home in

14:01.655 --> 14:28.050
Laredo, where the celebration of his appointment

14:01.655 --> 14:28.050
was held in true Aggie fashion at the Cadillac bar 
in Nueva Laredo, a famous establishment

14:30.393 --> 14:34.839
led by Porter Garner Jr., an Aggie class of 45.

14:39.084 --> 14:54.624
Another classic Wayne Stark practice

14:39.084 --> 14:54.624
was identified as the green couch treatment. 
Quotation marks around green couch treatment.

15:01.240 --> 15:29.155
This unforgettable

15:01.240 --> 15:29.155
encounter occurred after

15:01.240 --> 15:29.155
the MSC director learned that a highly promising 
student was not living

15:01.240 --> 15:29.155
up to his potential. and instead was loafing.

15:40.663 --> 15:49.135
Stark would maneuver

15:40.663 --> 15:49.135
the youngster to his office.

15:53.281 --> 15:58.669
After closing the door, he seated the visitor on an 
old couch

16:00.472 --> 16:19.158
covered

16:00.472 --> 16:19.158
with notably outdated green vinyl.

16:19.178 --> 16:27.610
Then the

16:19.178 --> 16:27.610
young man received a life-changing, what often 
proved to be a life-changing lecture

16:29.176 --> 16:58.626
about the foolishness of laziness, the 
foolishness

16:29.176 --> 16:58.626
of failure,

16:29.176 --> 16:58.626
the obligation to serve

17:02.335 --> 17:17.055
and the quiet honor

17:02.335 --> 17:17.055
of service

17:02.335 --> 17:17.055
and reliability.

17:31.054 --> 17:31.735
By the Fairly early in

17:34.145 --> 18:01.215
my A&M years,

17:34.145 --> 18:01.215
Mr. Stark invited me to serve as one of the advisors 
to SCONA, S-C-O-N-A,

17:34.145 --> 18:01.215
the Student Conference on National Affairs. Then 
a truly notable effort

18:03.305 --> 18:18.224
held about

18:03.305 --> 18:18.224
during the first week of December.

18:22.048 --> 18:33.042
It was a conference for

18:22.048 --> 18:33.042
500

18:22.048 --> 18:33.042
or more delegates from colleges and universities 
scattered all across the nation, particularly

18:34.912 --> 19:02.235
including the notable institutions on the east 
and west coast, service academies,

18:34.912 --> 19:02.235
plus

18:34.912 --> 19:02.235
almost every institution in the southwest. The 
students raised the money by calling on NM former

19:04.257 --> 19:26.628
students,

19:04.257 --> 19:26.628
Texas corporations,

19:04.257 --> 19:26.628
and their own family friends. The speakers were 
always

19:34.835 --> 19:39.701
individuals of high merit and notoriety.

19:45.489 --> 20:01.669
One unforgettable moment in that

19:45.489 --> 20:01.669
tradition came in 1962 when the Vice President of 
the United States, Lyndon Baines Johnson, came to

19:45.489 --> 20:01.669
speak to a packed house at G. Reilly White 
Coliseum.

20:13.520 --> 20:25.677
His older daughter, Linda Byrd, then a freshman at 
the University of Texas at Austin, came over to

20:13.520 --> 20:25.677
hear her father's remarks.

20:28.962 --> 20:32.567
Came over that morning to hear her father's 
remarks.

20:36.277 --> 21:01.187
In the era of an all-male student body, the 
commander of the Corps of Cadets invited this

20:36.277 --> 21:01.187
attractive Longhorn visitor to be his guest at the 
Duncan Dining Hall

20:36.277 --> 21:01.187
where the entire Corps would enjoy her presence.

21:06.567 --> 21:08.570
Since the Longhorn football team. Had just.

21:15.199 --> 21:15.880
Obliterated. The Aggies.

21:21.308 --> 21:22.389
On Thanksgiving Day.

21:25.313 --> 21:26.495
With a runaway score. It seemed appropriate to 
repay.

21:33.465 --> 21:35.848
To quote repay the quote. This representative of 
the Longhorns. So. In the near the middle of the

21:43.871 --> 21:45.573
meal.

21:52.162 --> 21:53.745
All of the fish in the core.

21:59.613 --> 22:00.194
Jumped up.

22:03.238 --> 22:04.840
And in perfect Aggie order. Yelled I yelled.

22:11.532 --> 22:13.373
Beat the hell out of tea. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:18.678 --> 22:20.360
They then stared quietly.

22:24.243 --> 22:26.745
At the one young lady in the room.

22:32.130 --> 22:32.951
Who stared? Back at them. as she placed

22:37.591 --> 23:06.045
her knife and fork back on the table, then lifted 
her napkin from her lap,

22:37.591 --> 23:06.045
stood up very erectly,

22:37.591 --> 23:06.045
pushed her chair under the table, and stared back 
at the now silent Aggie audience.

23:13.061 --> 23:36.252
Then

23:13.061 --> 23:36.252
she yelled out

23:13.061 --> 23:36.252
with her hands raised high

23:13.061 --> 23:36.252
above her head fore and little fingers extended in 
each palm

23:38.240 --> 23:50.230
as she proclaimed, hook them horns. Immediately 
the Aggies jumped to their feet, applauded her,

23:52.652 --> 24:04.502
and everyone in the audience smiled.

24:04.522 --> 24:07.605
As a footnote, it seems appropriate to add at this 
point

24:10.555 --> 24:37.542
But 18

24:10.555 --> 24:37.542
years after this event, my wife and I, almost 18 
years after this event, my wife and I attended our

24:10.555 --> 24:37.542
first meeting of the University of Texas Board of 
Regents following our appointment

24:10.555 --> 24:37.542
to lead the University of Texas at El Paso.

24:41.690 --> 24:49.760
At a dinner party the first night of the meeting 
served at the president's residence in Austin.

24:55.087 --> 24:56.769
We were near the head of the line. And took our 
plates. Into the library area of that beautiful

25:01.235 --> 25:04.419
home. And we're about to sit down. When the. wife of 
the former president of the United States, came

25:11.795 --> 25:17.962
into the room.

25:20.725 --> 25:25.650
We thought it would be appropriate to go over and 
introduce ourselves to Mrs. Johnson. And after

25:27.492 --> 25:41.768
the first formal words, I then recounted this 
episode

25:27.492 --> 25:41.768
involving her daughter at A&M in 1962.

25:46.946 --> 25:56.617
When I concluded, she instantly smiled, leaned 
over and said, proudly, that's my girl.

26:04.366 --> 26:12.075
Looking back on the

26:04.366 --> 26:12.075
role of the MSC, Wayne Stark with Wayne Stark as its 
director, and many, many organizations,

26:12.562 --> 26:38.653
campus organizations tied there, it is clear that 
he played a truly significant role in student

26:12.562 --> 26:38.653
development at that time.

26:44.118 --> 27:09.518
Although there was a dean of students in those 
years,

26:44.118 --> 27:09.518
it did not then or now seem that that office was very 
significant in generating activities which

26:44.118 --> 27:09.518
would

27:14.172 --> 27:18.298
polish the leadership talents of the students.

27:21.322 --> 27:38.627
It was Stark who brought the art and the music and he 
and his associates

27:21.322 --> 27:38.627
encouraged the students to become involved and 
develop their talents.

27:41.971 --> 27:42.492
In addition, He was an old friend with the then dean 
of the Harvard Graduate School of Business

27:43.687 --> 28:11.247
who had grown up in Bryan and was at that time the 
only non-Harvard graduate to serve as dean at the

27:43.687 --> 28:11.247
first

28:14.095 --> 28:18.041
institution of higher education created in the 
United States. Can't think of his name, last name,

28:20.585 --> 28:24.350
Robert something or other. We'll get it later.

28:29.738 --> 28:42.617
Dozens

28:29.738 --> 28:42.617
of youngsters with maroon and white blood

28:29.738 --> 28:42.617
were admitted to Harvard, to the Harvard MBA 
program

28:45.517 --> 29:13.971
simply on the basis of a phone call from the 
director of the Texas A&M MS Memorial Student

28:45.517 --> 29:13.971
Center

28:45.517 --> 29:13.971
to that dean

28:45.517 --> 29:13.971
who had learned that a stark recommendation could 
always be relied upon as a sound judgment

28:45.517 --> 29:13.971
of high capability and splendid potential.

29:26.429 --> 29:33.658
To a new faculty member of the Corps of Cadets was 
hard to understand.

29:39.105 --> 29:43.030
That was particularly so for

29:46.115 --> 30:15.852
A person whose father,

29:46.115 --> 30:15.852
whose cabinetmaker father,

29:46.115 --> 30:15.852
on a few occasions indicated that he thought his 
son ought to go to Texas A&M because of that

29:46.115 --> 30:15.852
father's recollection that during the 
Depression, A&M graduates, quote, were able to

29:46.115 --> 30:15.852
keep their job while others got laid off.

30:21.499 --> 30:43.382
That view probably was correct

30:21.499 --> 30:43.382
because engineers

30:21.499 --> 30:43.382
and agriculture majors were in high demand as the 
country was trying to recover from its greatest

30:21.499 --> 30:43.382
economic failure.

30:43.402 --> 30:44.083
But to this young high school kid there seemed no 
attraction to go to a school that was all male

30:45.667 --> 31:02.164
and where every student had to be wear a uniform in 
the Coral Cadets for at least the first two years.

31:06.828 --> 31:14.256
After seeing Aggies quote misbehave quote at the 
Rice football games A&M seemed, some of the A&M's

31:16.733 --> 31:23.739
practices seemed even more of an anomaly. For 
example,
