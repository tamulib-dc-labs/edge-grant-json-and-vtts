WEBVTT

00:02.782 --> 00:04.264
How did you all feel about him? He became dean in the 
50s. What kind of a dean was he? We were concerned he

00:07.689 --> 00:10.333
was good. I agree. I agree. See, Margaret worked 
for him. Really? Oh. Oh, she worked for him. Was he a

00:19.987 --> 00:21.349
good person to work for? Yeah.

00:24.514 --> 00:32.586
But she had a...

00:24.514 --> 00:32.586
She'd been in so many different things And she was a 
gal that wouldn't back off for anything. And she'd

00:39.578 --> 01:02.067
come home and say, Dean Benson, and they had a 
fight, the big boys, Dean Benson and the boys that

00:39.578 --> 01:02.067
were running the,

00:39.578 --> 01:02.067
what do you call it, where they, My memory is from 
then. And they had a big fight in there one time, and

01:08.804 --> 01:14.051
she was telling me about it. And he, and Dean Benson 
came out of that room just red, Cumberston. The

01:21.983 --> 01:22.864
other guy left. Cajon. Cajon, they were fighting. 
And he left. Dean came out of there. And Margaret

01:34.328 --> 01:39.957
said her office was like this, like the doors over 
there. And they had a chair right here. And he

01:45.406 --> 01:49.192
plopped himself down in that chair.

01:51.936 --> 01:57.585
And I'd given Margaret some of her little old cars.

01:58.426 --> 02:01.089
And she had one of them in the drawer. And she says, 
Dean, do you want to see my new automobile?

02:08.456 --> 02:12.940
And so she reached in the drawer and pulled it out 
and put it in the run of him. And he broke up

02:14.402 --> 02:17.485
laughing. She was that way. She could settle him 
down. That's what she was after. And if I could chat

02:26.337 --> 02:31.843
with her, would she say positive things about Fred 
Benson? Yes. She had a high regard for him. Some of

02:38.830 --> 02:43.575
those employees she had up there, she didn't like. 
Now, where was the dean's office? It was in the

02:46.138 --> 02:52.885
engineering building on that end, on the second 
floor up there. When Earl Rudder was selected as

02:53.472 --> 03:00.804
the new president of Texas A&M, what did you and the 
other people here on the campus think? We didn't

03:02.086 --> 03:04.410
pay any attention to it. You see, my father had told 
me about so much about this faculty, that all these

03:04.430 --> 03:18.895
people were in here that didn't have that 
background. Mm-hmm. And they were fighting and

03:20.168 --> 03:24.915
killing each other. Just climbing up a ladder. If 
you could knock them off a ladder, so be it. And I

03:29.662 --> 03:32.746
just sat back and laughed at them. I had a boss named 
Vestal. And he was a hard hitter. But I knew what was

03:42.841 --> 03:49.551
going to happen.

03:50.206 --> 03:55.274
They'll just fight themselves to pieces, and few 
of them will win. But most of them will leave and go

03:56.416 --> 03:59.480
somewhere else. Now, in the 50s, where did you and 
your family live? In the 50s, I built my home out in

04:03.887 --> 04:09.375
North Oakwood. In North Oakwood. I built that in 
46, and I still live in there. And on what street?

04:16.727 --> 04:17.648
College View Street. What did it cost? Do you 
remember what it cost per square foot to build it?

04:23.852 --> 04:28.277
It cost about, the total thing I think was about 
$8,000. And it stood the time. It was still, it

04:32.041 --> 04:35.125
hadn't cracked or anything. It's got 57 yards of 
concrete in that slab. And the NM Consolidated

04:41.171 --> 04:46.437
School was right there convenient for your 
children. No, we were on Bryan. Oh, I'm sorry. You

04:54.440 --> 04:55.360
said North Oakwood. I was thinking of South 
Oakwood. North Oakwood, yeah. We had to wait until

04:59.805 --> 05:02.867
they paid.

05:05.830 --> 05:07.191
We had a fight on that. The Crockett School.

05:13.998 --> 05:16.660
Mary had to walk down that thing and cross that How

05:17.129 --> 05:27.843
new was North Oakwood when you built your house? 
Were there many houses in it? There were a few in

05:30.947 --> 05:38.556
there, but they were all built prior to World War 
II. In the block I was in, there are There were two

05:43.893 --> 05:47.397
there and three there. There were three houses in 
there.

05:54.905 --> 06:00.371
Ours was the fourth one and the fifth one was built 
about 1950. So they're trying to sell it at

06:00.771 --> 06:08.280
$129,000.

06:09.441 --> 06:12.364
If you and your wife and your friends were going to 
go out for entertainment in the 50s. Where did you

06:16.639 --> 06:17.320
go? Oh, the college put on a lot of things. They were 
good about that sort of thing. Oh, you went to the

06:27.033 --> 06:32.740
Skyway. The Skyway drive-in? Drive-ins were big. 
You could carry your kids with you and everything

06:38.268 --> 06:40.731
else. Did y'all go much downtown to the movie? Yes, 
we went to the movies. Where would you have gone out

06:47.301 --> 06:48.763
to eat? We went to Hotard's. At Hotard's? 
Downtown. And we trained our children that once

06:55.151 --> 07:07.107
they got through that door at Hotard's, they 
didn't make any, carry on any fuss. They would

07:07.988 --> 07:08.930
behave. They behaved. Were you all churchgoers in 
the 50s? Oh, yeah. Where? First Presbyterian

07:16.659 --> 07:21.427
Church of College Station. We got in a big fight 
with Dean Boulder. And we wanted to fire Dr.

07:25.895 --> 07:32.487
Anderson, the preacher. We thought it was time we 
went in.

07:45.848 --> 07:52.736
Because I think y'all were going there when we got 
here in 59 and I think y'all were in that church

07:45.848 --> 07:52.736
then. Yeah. We got here just after the new building 
opened.

08:03.647 --> 08:05.169
Yes, sir. The old one was still standing when we got 
here in September of 59 but the services were being

08:05.529 --> 08:15.180
held in the new building. Yeah, you see, another 
thing, I had a business on the side, Scotts

08:16.443 --> 08:24.510
Industries.

08:26.732 --> 08:40.084
I realized that

08:26.732 --> 08:40.084
we didn't have any printing, blueprinting for 
engineers here. We all had to send it to Austin or

08:40.625 --> 08:46.230
Houston or Waco.

08:47.105 --> 08:55.413
About that time, in about 1946,

08:47.105 --> 08:55.413
Oculus came on with a new machine, and I bought it. 
And where did you open that business? In my garage.

09:01.399 --> 09:05.082
All right, when it outgrew that, where did you 
locate it? It's on Old Southern Spring Road. That

09:08.426 --> 09:12.490
building's got that big billboard in the front of 
it. So that's where you started? Really? After you

09:16.517 --> 09:19.020
left the garage, where it is now? Yeah. Now, when 
did you leave A&M? In 60. 60. We used to run that

09:25.867 --> 09:30.932
thing for a long time. The only thing we really made 
money on was, you didn't make much money on what

09:30.952 --> 09:44.567
came over the counter except for people like 
Codell, Ralph, and Scott. When you printed a job

09:45.526 --> 09:54.214
for them, it usually cost them about four or five 
grand. And that's when you made your money. And

09:58.758 --> 10:02.261
you'd make one of those about every year. And so I 
never, one of the things I did, I never involved

10:03.823 --> 10:14.773
myself as a professional engineer. except in my 
own business, which was airfoil. I started

10:19.735 --> 10:21.357
airfoil in 60. Airfoil Impellers. 
A-I-R-F-O-I-L? Impellers Incorporated. It's

10:31.408 --> 10:42.280
over on over

10:31.408 --> 10:42.280
in the industrial fire right next to the power 
plant over there. And Brian. And Brian. And so that

10:49.287 --> 10:56.739
just grew, and so that kept me busy. So I finally 
quit A&M in 1960. All right, and your wife worked

11:00.404 --> 11:03.429
how long out here? I don't know. She also, first 
thing she did in 1960, she She was, we made her

11:13.343 --> 11:21.392
postmaster's bride.

11:23.814 --> 11:25.236
And we were Republicans. Took us a long time to do 
it, but the one that really, really warped it up

11:26.037 --> 11:43.215
was, what

11:26.037 --> 11:43.215
were we talking about the other,

11:26.037 --> 11:43.215
he was, he was the one But it was J.W. Hall that got it 
for us.

11:53.181 --> 11:55.123
He was big in the Republican Party.

11:58.286 --> 12:04.793
Who were the other key Republicans in Brazos 
County in the 50s, 60s? Well, all the people except

12:04.933 --> 12:11.059
for ones we called Yellow Dog Democrats. Yellow 
Dog Democrats.

12:22.004 --> 12:23.205
Those are the liberals. And there were about 10% of 
all the people in Texas were among those. But the

12:31.356 --> 12:41.248
Democrat Party, the

12:31.356 --> 12:41.248
people that were in there and voting, were 
Republicans in nature. Oh, I know. But who were the

12:46.703 --> 12:50.807
key leaders in this county that were Republicans 
early on? J.W. Hall, myself, and

12:52.809 --> 13:07.225
later on it was, what's the name of the bookstore 
man? Leupold? Well, Leupold was the one that kept

13:09.832 --> 13:14.136
us from getting Thomas' appointment. And she 
didn't have it very long. Of course, then Kennedy

13:17.099 --> 13:24.986
went out, so they went back and moved with him. He 
was a Democrat. And so

13:28.729 --> 13:37.577
that's where we were kind of out in the cold. 
There's a little story about that. John Tower came

13:43.022 --> 13:51.613
down here on one of his trips down here as a 
Republican. And he flew into Easterwood

13:53.255 --> 14:00.545
Field. And

14:01.786 --> 14:08.695
so, oh.

14:11.105 --> 14:29.869
They asked us to go out and so he'd have some people 
to speak to, you know, to stop and tell us what he was

14:11.105 --> 14:29.869
going to do. So we did. And when the newspaper 
reported that, he said, They labeled off some of

14:39.067 --> 14:48.697
the people that were there and said a small group, 
including a Babes in Arms.

14:54.223 --> 14:56.265
You know who that Babes in Arms was? Your 
grandchild? No, my son. Oh. Well, our youngest

15:00.449 --> 15:01.550
son. Oh. James. But how old was he? He was just as 
young as that. That was in 60. Oh, okay, okay.

15:16.492 --> 15:21.398
Mama was older

15:16.492 --> 15:21.398
than me. We had gone out there to the help tower, you 
know, try to get a little, and then

15:22.199 --> 15:37.879
we had a lot of meetings and I remember one of them, I 
was talking to George Bush, who ran for governor.

15:46.824 --> 15:53.755
He and I stood out on the side of that building over 
there at the American Legion for about two hours

15:46.824 --> 15:53.755
just talking to each other.

15:59.083 --> 16:03.850
That's the first Georgian.

16:04.211 --> 16:06.554
What was your impression of him then? Good. See, I 
was the precinct chairman for 11

16:08.774 --> 16:18.624
for 30 some odd years.

16:22.048 --> 16:25.912
Who was the first important Republican to win a 
local office here? Do you remember?

16:32.278 --> 16:34.401
Would that be up in the 60s or 70s? It probably would 
be. because they were all Democrats back there.

16:41.555 --> 16:52.607
But still, what they said and what they did was 
exactly what the Republicans are doing today.

16:53.628 --> 16:58.934
They're at heart, they're really Republicans.

17:00.136 --> 17:04.060
But they're all what we call closet Republicans. 
And we go ask, like,

17:04.850 --> 17:17.107
the president of the bank, or the president of the 
big company. He was a closet Republican. He'd give

17:23.175 --> 17:26.340
you some money, but you didn't say nothing about 
it. You just wouldn't use it. I mean, we're talking

17:29.284 --> 17:32.308
closeted Republicans. All right, I believe we can 
kind of bring this to a conclusion now. Trying to

17:38.879 --> 17:50.376
summarize all of your A&M relations,

17:38.879 --> 17:50.376
what did you learn in all of the years you were 
associated with A&M that was important in your

17:38.879 --> 17:50.376
life? What did it mean to you to have an A&M 
connection? The engineering background I got.

18:00.368 --> 18:02.491
And what I could do with it afterwards. And it was a 
good background? Yeah. And when I worked for A&M, I

18:06.575 --> 18:16.547
was someone over there that people sought out. Was 
the Texas A&M engineering, was it theoretical or

18:17.248 --> 18:23.796
was it applied? It was applied. Problem solving, 
real world.

18:30.963 --> 18:32.425
They always came after me. I mean,

18:32.445 --> 18:37.873
J.W. Sorensen was one of my classmates. He was 
always after me. And what I know, and I've known

18:44.163 --> 18:54.658
this for a long time, for about 60-some odd years, 
fan business is a real... You got simple

18:56.022 --> 19:01.769
engineering in it, and it's just as 
straightforward as you can be. But for some reason

19:02.510 --> 19:06.755
or another, engineers just don't like it.

19:10.239 --> 19:17.809
And this computer came on, and that saved me an 
awful lot of trouble. That thing there.

19:21.774 --> 19:25.438
What creates this Aggie pride and spirit? Why are 
Aggies so proud? Because the

19:29.150 --> 19:41.888
relationship they have with other people is one of 
the things. But they've always had,

19:43.510 --> 19:55.527
well, their athletics has been up and straight and 
always good. you never outside of that thing that

19:55.726 --> 20:22.982
happened in Baylor I don't know of any other place 
they behaved themselves when they went off and

19:55.726 --> 20:22.982
that thing in Baylor was all Baylor it wasn't A&M 
but I think the biggest thing was when the old time

19:55.726 --> 20:22.982
stuff when they marched in there at on company 
front and they were all in there at one time or they

20:24.380 --> 20:52.513
were coming out and then they had you had you had 
supervision from army people now I think that's

20:24.380 --> 20:52.513
one of the best things we can have in a school now I'm 
in the alliance club and we've had two men in the

20:24.380 --> 20:52.513
alliance club that that were operating the ones in 
Bryan High School. And what I saw those men do with

20:57.756 --> 21:03.184
those kids, I appreciated it. Because they knew, 
the kids knew that there was a certain discipline

21:04.867 --> 21:13.860
that they had to get down. And so that's one of the 
things. And I hate to, I'm glad the Corps is still

21:18.026 --> 21:22.433
here. and I think it ought to be in almost all of the 
big high schools. We wouldn't be, they wouldn't be

21:28.615 --> 21:33.744
hauling guns in there. If you were a hired 
consultant to Texas A&M's leadership now, the

21:33.764 --> 21:47.307
decision makers about this institution, what 
would you advise them to do with A&M in the future?

21:54.509 --> 21:55.631
is Millen College. I mean, get other colleges and 
institutions. I mean, not colleges, but out of

22:01.400 --> 22:06.588
high school. The transition from high school into 
an institution like this, an ordinary man can't

22:07.669 --> 22:17.224
handle it. But if you can put him in an institution 
like, uh blend college they're doing one hell of a

22:23.298 --> 22:50.284
job i saw it with my son they just start to blossom 
how how big should a m's enrollment be allowed to

22:23.298 --> 22:50.284
grow 50 grand you think we could handle that many 
students i think you can but i i would i would take a

22:23.298 --> 22:50.284
and m and uh Of course, we've got Glenn, which I 
think is enough right here, but they're going to

22:50.753 --> 22:58.042
have to be others. But you've got to have them up 
against, well, like Brenham is a good

22:59.183 --> 23:05.311
organization there. There's theirs there. But 
all of the big institutions have got to do this the

23:08.014 --> 23:13.140
same way. You've got to have them come out of high 
school, then you've got to have them go into some

23:13.160 --> 23:20.389
sort of a, junior college, what I call it, and have 
those very well-regulated and top-flight

23:20.960 --> 23:34.160
employees, or professors. It's just important to 
put the best man there and have him here at A&M. And

23:42.413 --> 23:49.043
another thing, they're all uptight about this 
that the professors should do research on. I'm not

23:56.583 --> 24:00.128
in favor of that. I agree with you. I want them to 
teach. Get down with the students and they, now if

24:05.196 --> 24:18.996
they can change that from have student activities 
that is

24:19.752 --> 24:35.775
Professors should have, he'd teach a class for 
many hours here, but I want him over here in some

24:19.752 --> 24:35.775
sort of activity that's helping them learn what he 
taught them. Right? Now, I can show you this. Texas

24:43.245 --> 24:48.072
Tech has this thing. I'm interested in this safe 
room for tornadoes. And they have a big thing with

24:56.398 --> 25:00.964
the FINA people. But they required all those 
people, and they sent me a list of them with their

25:02.766 --> 25:14.079
little piddling things,

25:02.766 --> 25:14.079
unconnected. Now, there's got to be some, you've 
got to teach these professors to teach the people

25:20.333 --> 25:25.558
to look at stuff. And the second thing is you never 
quit reading and studying. I can tell you, if

25:32.844 --> 25:45.575
you're interested in mechanics like that, take 
Popular Mechanics and Popular Science, read them

25:32.844 --> 25:45.575
from cover to cover. And also, you can get a lot of 
engineering books. I spent many hours over here

25:50.877 --> 25:56.423
in- In the Enging Library? No, not the Enging

25:57.103 --> 26:01.728
Library. Oh. The regular library. In Cushing. 
Cushing. And that big old room up there, I'd sit

26:04.411 --> 26:08.015
there many hours. And what I was doing, I was trying 
to change a V8 Ford into a front-wheel drive.

26:21.067 --> 26:37.425
If you could make a major gift to Texas A&M, 
somebody walked up to you and gave you a check for a

26:21.067 --> 26:37.425
million dollars, but you have to pass it on to A&M, 
but you decide how the money will be spent, what

26:21.067 --> 26:37.425
would you want A&M to do with a gift that you made? 
What would you want it for?

26:43.251 --> 26:44.312
What in ag engineering? Students, faculty, 
research? No, mainly students and faculty that

26:49.130 --> 27:10.466
are conscious of, well, it amounts to the fluid 
mechanics,

26:49.130 --> 27:10.466
the air. I'm a fan man. I'm sitting here and I know 
more about fans than anybody in the country. I can

27:19.436 --> 27:21.138
tell you that and I can back it up.

27:24.063 --> 27:25.585
You want somebody to continue that? Continue 
that, work at it, and I've

27:26.967 --> 27:34.678
got I've got equipment in my shop out here that 
won't be built for 10 years. My, my, how good, how

27:39.959 --> 27:41.802
good. I mean, because the price of energy is too 
low. I mean, that's, and you've got to get people,

27:47.931 --> 27:59.268
you've got to train these people to look at things 
and sit and study them. And then they've got to

27:59.288 --> 28:02.893
help.

28:06.940 --> 28:09.964
It's a marvelous field in health. All right, my 
last question. What feelings do you carry in your

28:12.188 --> 28:15.813
heart today for Texas A&M? How do you feel about A&M 
today? Well, it's a great institution. That's all

28:20.580 --> 28:22.182
I can say about it.

28:25.227 --> 28:36.103
People can come here, and if they apply 
themselves, and according to what they tell them,

28:37.703 --> 28:40.786
They'll survive. Now, you may not end up in what you 
set out to do as your own thing, but you can follow it

28:41.266 --> 29:03.906
along and do the very best you can, and you'll be 
rewarded for it. Are you grateful your dad got

29:03.926 --> 29:07.069
hired here in 1919? Oh, yeah. I'm sorry he didn't 
live, but that's, that's, that's the roll of the

29:09.911 --> 29:15.300
dice. He wound up the,

29:17.062 --> 29:29.441
the

29:17.062 --> 29:29.441
cancer had taken his brain

29:17.062 --> 29:29.441
away. One side of his brain. But you're a proud 
Aggie today. I'm a proud egghead today. I'm sure he

29:35.686 --> 29:37.809
was too. He was really satisfied with what 
happened to him here. And I'm sure he'd have been a

29:44.620 --> 29:52.693
dean and he'd have been top of this thing yet. About 
what age was he? He was 56. 56. A young man.
