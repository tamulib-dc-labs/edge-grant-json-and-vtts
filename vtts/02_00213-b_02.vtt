WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:04.032
Was he a former Yale leader? No, he was not. Okay. He 
was in the Corps and then he went on to get his

00:05.595 --> 00:11.986
graduate degree and then went to Tech for a while 
and then came back. And when you went out of town,

00:13.429 --> 00:16.233
normally what did you all wear? We had travel 
uniforms. we would wear, it was always up to the

00:18.610 --> 00:23.860
yell leaders to picket and that the university 
would provide those as well. Like we had khaki

00:23.921 --> 00:32.317
pants, a shirt that had embroidered yell leader in 
our class year, the block A&M, and then jackets for

00:23.921 --> 00:32.317
when it was cold. Alright, Landon Shreveport, how 
long was it before somebody recognized you as an

00:32.658 --> 00:39.792
Aggie yell leader? Right off the plane. Simply 
because there were five guys, all with the same

00:41.355 --> 00:45.039
haircut, all wearing the same thing. And so either 
an IU would recognize us or someone would ask us. I

00:49.803 --> 00:51.345
mean, it was all the time. And they were cordial? 
Very cordial, very cordial. Even people from

00:54.348 --> 00:56.810
other schools, that was the neat thing, except 
Texas Tech. Texas Tech and University of Texas

00:56.930 --> 01:00.514
were the two that just were bad. Okay, then, so 
Louisiana Tech. Then where was the next big

01:04.217 --> 01:08.361
out-of-town game? Probably Missouri was really 
big.

01:16.404 --> 01:17.587
I think that was the last one of the year. I remember 
Nebraska was a big out-of-town game. Up there?

01:20.795 --> 01:21.336
Yeah. We went to Nebraska, to Oklahoma City, to 
Missouri, to Shreveport. and then to Tech that

01:28.692 --> 01:30.314
year. I think those were our five away games. What 
was your impression of a game at Lincoln? Amazing.

01:36.260 --> 01:37.941
Lincoln, Nebraska is amazing for football. The 
fans, very similar fans as far as A&M and Nebraska

01:37.961 --> 01:42.146
goes. Undying support for their team and they 
aren't rude to the opposing team. It was great.

01:48.792 --> 01:50.995
Usually when we went places we'd get some funny 
looks. People would make fun of us simply because

01:51.035 --> 01:53.998
of what we were wearing, what we were doing. Never 
happened in Nebraska. They gave a standing

01:56.360 --> 01:58.142
ovation to our band. They, when we were doing it 
after the game, we have a yell practice when we

01:58.257 --> 02:05.066
obviously get outscored when the time runs out. 
And so we did our yell practice. Then afterwards,

02:07.430 --> 02:10.213
people were just coming up, left and right, just 
being like, man, we're so impressed with y'all.

02:10.233 --> 02:21.309
The fact that y'all are yelling even though you 
were down, it was just, it was very, it was a good

02:10.233 --> 02:21.309
feeling, you know, just because you got support 
even though we didn't necessarily deserve it, you

02:10.233 --> 02:21.309
know, which was really neat. I was a chancellor at 
Missouri, but before, what was your impression

02:21.609 --> 02:28.078
there? Missouri was neat, and it was neat simply 
because we had lost a couple games, and then we won

02:28.852 --> 02:34.823
that one, and so it was really good. It was like a 
running upswing. I remember being very happy

02:36.226 --> 02:38.109
about us winning. We stayed in St. Louis, and it was 
a really good time simply because I'd been saving

02:39.231 --> 02:47.486
money, and I got to take Kate with me up to Missouri. 
Now, she went to Shreveport with us, and She went to

02:50.114 --> 02:52.724
Oklahoma City, but she went to Oklahoma City 
because she drove. But I bought Kate a plane ticket

02:53.105 --> 02:56.780
to go to St. Louis with us. So that was a really, 
really neat weekend for us. and right then like

03:01.083 --> 03:25.977
dusty who was one of the senior leaders he hadn't 
had a girlfriend and he had just gotten a

03:01.083 --> 03:25.977
girlfriend a couple months before so he brought 
her as well and so we just had a really good time that

03:01.083 --> 03:25.977
was a really fun time for the five of us to have fun in 
another city because we had time to do so does that

03:01.083 --> 03:25.977
make sense so we really just kind of walked around 
st louis kind of experienced what st louis was

03:01.083 --> 03:25.977
because i had never been there before so that was 
The thing that I'm going to pull away from Yell

03:26.108 --> 03:32.259
Leader so much is just the opportunities that it 
gave me that I just wouldn't have had otherwise. I

03:32.980 --> 03:33.982
mean, I just wouldn't have had it. For instance, 
something that we got to do, the volleyball team

03:34.944 --> 03:39.392
did really good last year when I was a junior Yell 
Leader. They made it to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA

03:39.652 --> 03:44.701
tournament, and our bracket was in Honolulu, 
Hawaii. So we got to go to Hawaii. So there's five of

03:47.566 --> 03:48.448
us. I picture there's five Yell Leaders there. 
three twenty two year olds one twenty one year old

03:51.556 --> 04:19.656
and one twenty year old and we go to hawaii we have 
rusty doesn't go with us so it's pretty much the

03:51.556 --> 04:19.656
five of us with no chaperones for five days the week 
of finals okay so we missed all our finals and we get

03:51.556 --> 04:19.656
out of them someone had to take a final there but the 
rest of us we just thankfully our teachers helped

03:51.556 --> 04:19.656
with it worked with us and we took them before or 
afterwards so we go to hawaii and none of us had ever

03:51.556 --> 04:19.656
been to hawaii before And it was just absolutely 
hysterical. It was the five of us with the

04:22.544 --> 04:27.132
volleyball team and the volleyball team coaches 
and some people in the athletic department. And we

04:27.512 --> 04:29.035
just had the time of our lives. I mean, first thing 
we did, we got off the plane, we went and rented

04:29.796 --> 04:33.402
scooters. And the guy who rented his scooters was 
just this, I mean, it was just funny. Like we still

04:38.810 --> 04:44.980
sit around and every once in a while when we get back 
together, the old guys from last year will tell

04:38.810 --> 04:44.980
stories about that trip. I mean, those are going to 
be stories that we talk about. for a long time.

04:54.945 --> 05:01.995
During that first fall as a Yale leader, how much 
time did you spend of your waking moments? Doing

05:03.738 --> 05:05.340
something having to do with Yale leader? Yeah. 
60%,

05:05.500 --> 05:09.686
70% of my waking time. What about your class 
attendance rate? It was relatively good. You find

05:15.813 --> 05:23.887
that Yale leaders, unless they're just people 
that don't care about grades, but if they have any

05:15.813 --> 05:23.887
care about grades, their grades get better once 
they become a Yale leader. They take less hours,

05:24.428 --> 05:38.833
obviously, but their grades become better 
because most people, when you get busy, you budget

05:24.428 --> 05:38.833
your time better, you study better, you don't 
waste as much time, which leads to a very active

05:24.428 --> 05:38.833
lifestyle and you don't get to rest a lot, but... It 
was good. Like, it was really good. I remember...

05:41.044 --> 05:44.629
Well, there were some classes that I just didn't go 
to because I didn't like them. But... Missed a lot

05:46.472 --> 05:48.876
of Friday classes, obviously, for away games. 
There was one teacher who just didn't... Just

05:50.258 --> 05:53.242
could care less what I was. And they just didn't 
budge an inch. Didn't budge an inch about stuff. I

05:57.769 --> 05:58.971
remember it was an English class. It was English 
222 World Literature with Snodgrass. Mr.

06:01.735 --> 06:02.457
Snodgrass. Dr. Snodgrass. I don't know. Anyway. 
And... I had done something out at the bonfire

06:05.982 --> 06:08.305
site. It's just a tradition that the Y'all Leaders 
did out there, and I was there until 5.15 in the

06:08.506 --> 06:13.934
morning. So I went home, and I was relatively 
physically bruised, and my hands were bloody and

06:14.855 --> 06:22.847
stuff like that, simply because of the work that I 
was doing. And I remember I had to clean up, put

06:23.648 --> 06:29.797
bandages on, all that kind of stuff, and then by the 
time that came around, it was about 7.30. So what I

06:29.817 --> 06:33.863
did is I just went, ate breakfast, got some coffee, 
and... I didn't make it to class perfectly on time.

06:37.322 --> 06:38.023
It was an 8 o'clock class. I got there like at 8.05. 
And we have quizzes, random attendance quizzes.

06:44.950 --> 06:47.472
And I didn't make it to that quiz. And so right after 
the class period, I walked downstairs and I walked

06:47.873 --> 06:50.996
down and talked to him. I was like, sir, is there any 
way that maybe I could make up this quiz? I was doing

06:53.698 --> 06:57.122
something, something, something along those 
lines. And he said, well, you should have thought

06:57.162 --> 07:00.205
about that when you run, shouldn't you? Now, and so 
your first year as a yield leader is 99. And

07:06.226 --> 07:15.072
did you, as a yield leader, did you go out to the cut 
area? I never went out to cut, no. We were always

07:16.828 --> 07:20.894
doing stuff on weekends, obviously game weekends 
or whatever. It was never one of those things where

07:20.954 --> 07:24.921
we had the time to go put in to cut. But went out to the 
stack site a couple times. And where were you when

07:28.347 --> 07:30.430
you heard? I was in my room. How did you hear? 
Someone knocked on the door. You were asleep?

07:35.839 --> 07:36.801
Yeah, I was asleep. This is off campus? No, I was on 
campus. I lived in Aston Hall. I moved back on

07:40.106 --> 07:41.689
campus my junior year. I moved back onto campus. 
Once I made Yell Leader, I realized that there's

07:43.552 --> 07:47.840
just no way I could maintain that schedule without 
being on campus. So I moved onto Southside, Aston

07:47.860 --> 07:50.064
Hall. And I remember, it was funny, I had a Yell 
Leader function that night. And I remember

07:57.425 --> 07:58.167
walking in. I was good friends with the crew chiefs 
in my dorm. So I remember walking into my dorm and

08:02.075 --> 08:06.263
them getting ready to go do their shift. Aston Hall 
was one of the ships that were out there that night.

08:09.430 --> 08:15.081
And Bill Davis, who is actually a friend of mine who 
is our crew chief, he is actually one of the ones

08:09.430 --> 08:15.081
injured. He broke his arm real bad. But I remember 
them being there and them yelling, hey, Ricky, do

08:16.865 --> 08:21.269
you want to go out there tonight? And I remember 
this is so plain to me. Like, here's the corner of

08:23.210 --> 08:24.291
the wall. They're standing down there. My room is 
down there. And I remember standing there. And I

08:28.335 --> 08:32.298
thought about it for like a minute, like for a good 
15, 20 seconds. I was like, can I go? I was like,

08:33.719 --> 08:36.782
when's the next shift? And they're like, we're 
doing it tomorrow night. And I was like, man, I got a

08:38.863 --> 08:41.025
quiz tomorrow morning. I was like, I'll come 
tomorrow night. So they're like, OK, fine. So I

08:43.507 --> 08:44.168
went to my room. Did whatever my room went to sleep 
about. 2.40 in the morning, someone knocked on the

08:48.016 --> 08:53.123
door and said, hey, bonfire just fell. We need to 
see who's in the dorm and who's not. So I run back

08:57.369 --> 08:59.332
out. I mean, of course, I run out to the field, and 
I'm just out on the field the rest of the morning.

09:04.980 --> 09:11.749
How long before you knew that someone of your 
acquaintance was hurt? Was hurt.

09:15.421 --> 09:16.062
A couple hours. I mean, I knew quite a few of the 
people they got. I knew two of the guys that

09:19.766 --> 09:22.410
actually passed away. When you got to the site, how 
many people were there observing? A couple

09:28.217 --> 09:28.617
hundred. There were a couple hundred. Was there 
any emergency equipment already there? Yes. Yes,

09:33.563 --> 09:34.885
there was emergency equipment there. As far as you 
can now determine, looking back, Was there any

09:41.982 --> 09:49.494
reaction to Bonfire in terms of what people tried 
to do soon after the collapse? Define the

09:51.678 --> 09:53.180
question, what do you mean? Like physically try to 
do, like help? Yeah, it's fallen. Is there

09:57.186 --> 10:04.378
anything that people did after that that was an 
error or that they failed to do that they should

09:57.186 --> 10:04.378
have done? Like, I have the impression just about 
everybody reacted about as well as they could

10:06.468 --> 10:10.314
have. Yeah, I don't think anything could have been 
done differently. I mean, you can't just go in

10:12.817 --> 10:15.962
there and start pulling logs, obviously. But, 
yeah, I mean, from my take on the situation,

10:17.865 --> 10:23.353
everything was handled great. Did all the other 
Yale leaders, were they all out there? Not with, at

10:25.840 --> 10:28.264
different times we went out there. I remember 
seeing a couple of them sometimes. But you went as

10:30.247 --> 10:31.649
an individual? I went as an individual. Not as a 
young man? No, I went as myself. I went as Ricky. And

10:37.177 --> 10:39.661
how long did you stay out there? I was out there 
until about 10, 15. In the morning? In the morning.

10:45.549 --> 10:53.221
And what were you and your buddies, your closest 
friends, what were you all thinking, saying,

10:45.549 --> 10:53.221
doing? Well, actually we had a meeting about what 
we were going to do, just because obviously

10:56.148 --> 10:59.293
Bonfire was in four days. And as a Yale leader, 
Bonfire was a big part of what we did, so we had to

11:00.395 --> 11:06.065
decide what we were going to do, what was going to 
happen. Had a couple meetings with the Vice

11:06.565 --> 11:12.495
President of Student Affairs, had a couple 
meetings just the five of us, came up with ideas,

11:06.565 --> 11:12.495
came up with what we wanted to do. I remember just 
standing out there, I remember this really

11:12.515 --> 11:18.325
vividly, just standing out there And just 
sitting, and honestly just sitting. And my phone,

11:23.279 --> 11:26.963
I had my cell phone on me at that time, and my cell 
phone was just running off the hook. I mean, every

11:27.544 --> 11:30.707
three seconds, I'd be on the phone and another call 
would come in. I mean, it was everybody from my

11:30.788 --> 11:37.996
parents to friends that I hadn't seen since first 
grade, my principals. I mean, everybody, anyone

11:39.257 --> 11:45.465
that knew that I was a Yale leader, just because 
they knew that Yale leaders had a lot to do with

11:39.257 --> 11:45.465
bonfire. So they didn't know if I was on the stack or 
not. Did you see, did you visibly see some of the

11:49.220 --> 11:57.162
victims who were picked up and taken? I did. Our 
number three son is a radiologist at St. Joseph,

11:58.957 --> 12:04.382
and he was on call that night. He does not talk about 
it at all. Because I get the impression, this is my

12:07.625 --> 12:24.179
conclusion, so that he's innocent of it, but I get 
the impression that some of the x-rays that he

12:07.625 --> 12:24.179
looked at and saw, just people just squashed and 
impressed. Then I have in there on my desk Mrs.

12:24.879 --> 12:28.963
Curley's just finished book about what she and her 
husband went through. The son, he died one day

12:35.631 --> 12:41.499
before his father's birthday. Guess what his SAT 
score was? 1540. Tested out a 45. He was an amazing

12:49.428 --> 12:55.416
kid. Did everybody pool together? Yes. Totally. 
It was amazing. I remember going to the service we

13:02.124 --> 13:06.470
had that night in Reed Arena. And I went, and I 
remember getting there about an hour and a half

13:08.373 --> 13:14.923
early and getting one of the seats near the front on 
the floor. And just, I mean, it was amazing. Like,

13:20.030 --> 13:22.574
you couldn't describe it. You just couldn't 
describe it. Now you said that you Yale leaders

13:26.133 --> 13:34.908
discussed what you all thought were going to 
recommend. What did you all recommend? To have a

13:37.272 --> 13:39.435
Yale practice. To have a modified Yale practice. 
To have something... It couldn't be... Because

13:43.061 --> 13:50.233
the thing that we didn't want is there was all this 
talk about... doing away with the rivalry you know

13:50.534 --> 14:09.505
this rivalry you know 12 students have died and yes 
12 students have died i'm not taking away from that

13:50.534 --> 14:09.505
at all but what we did not want to do was have another 
memorial service we didn't want to have another

13:50.534 --> 14:09.505
memorial service there was going to be that the 
candlelight vigil that night we didn't want to

13:50.534 --> 14:09.505
have another memorial service in Caulfield is 
essentially what it was. And there was a football

14:13.712 --> 14:15.955
game the next day, and it was a big football game. 
The University of Texas was number five in the

14:15.975 --> 14:18.097
nation at that point. That was a very big time for 
us. And we didn't want it to be another memorial

14:20.219 --> 14:22.762
service. And so we tried to come up with stuff to 
which would be uplifting. And that night, there's

14:28.227 --> 14:35.695
probably six memories that are going to stay with 
me for the rest of my life. Oh, cool. Just visually.

14:37.781 --> 14:38.743
Describe those. From Yell Leader.

14:42.430 --> 14:43.312
See if I can remember them. One is definitely...

14:50.710 --> 15:07.251
That night, that night on the cow field with all, 
when the cannon is, I don't know if you were there or

14:50.710 --> 15:07.251
not, but there was a point in the Yale practice when 
the cannon 12, fired 12 times and we were arm and arm

14:50.710 --> 15:07.251
at the 50 yard line. And there were all the candles 
around us. And literally, I mean, we were five

15:09.975 --> 15:14.942
grown men that were just weeping, just weeping. 
That was amazing. That was one. Another one was

15:18.768 --> 15:28.021
when we won the next day when we beat Texas in a game 
where we shouldn't have won. But we won. That was

15:29.042 --> 15:31.045
amazing. As you saw the team in action, were you 
aware that they seemed to have something? Very

15:37.454 --> 15:38.075
much so. Being in that locker room, it was really 
neat being in the locker room before the games just

15:38.155 --> 15:44.404
because you got to see the team and you got to see how 
they warmed up. And it was completely different.

15:47.188 --> 15:48.450
There was just a different feel. How? What was the 
feel? Was it quieter? Yeah. It wasn't as loud,

15:52.896 --> 15:55.079
honestly. More serious? Much more serious. It's 
like there was a purpose other than just football

15:57.102 --> 15:59.766
that day. And did the coaches seem to reflect that 
too? Very much so. Very much so. It was... And were

16:05.744 --> 16:10.531
you on the field when the Longhorn band? I was. I was 
on the field. I couldn't see it, honestly, because

16:13.556 --> 16:22.851
one of the requirements, not requirements, but 
one of the things we do is we kind of guard the field

16:13.556 --> 16:22.851
during the bands because we don't want anyone 
running down out of the field. And so we are on a knee

16:23.219 --> 16:28.344
at the 50-yard line on the visitor's side. And so we 
really can't see anything. So we didn't see the

16:30.045 --> 16:32.247
front and see what they were doing. But we heard 
about it. And we heard obviously a lot of cheering

16:33.368 --> 16:35.790
and a lot of whooping. So we heard that that was 
amazing. And you heard Amazing Grace. Obviously.

16:41.615 --> 16:42.016
Obviously. That's one of the things was singing 
Amazing Grace in Reed Arena that night. Just how it

16:50.263 --> 16:52.365
just spurred up. And no one wanted to leave.

16:56.723 --> 16:57.284
That was amazing. It really, truly was. All right. 
Now that, obviously, the toughest, most serious

17:05.154 --> 17:10.600
moment of that whole season. Go to the other 
extreme now. What were some of the goofiest

17:12.843 --> 17:17.509
moments of being a first year? Goofiest moments of 
being a first year? Yeah.

17:24.037 --> 17:28.834
Do you remember goofing up yourself and getting 
the wrong yell? Oh man, I remember one time we were

17:29.898 --> 17:33.591
doing fish camps. one of the requirements during 
the summer that we do is we go up and we do the yell

17:34.516 --> 18:03.122
practices at fish camp and it was the first one and 
we were so nervous because this was the first time

17:34.516 --> 18:03.122
that we were in front of actually new students we 
had done the new student conferences okay parents

17:34.516 --> 18:03.122
were there it wasn't a big deal this is completely 
students okay right now we are doing our job we are

17:34.516 --> 18:03.122
teaching yells and we're doing a full yell 
practice and oh man i was just so nervous like i was

17:34.516 --> 18:03.122
flipping out i get up there and i say okay this is the 
yell that we're going to do and i pass it back and i

17:34.516 --> 18:03.122
teach the wrong yell I teach the wrong yell. And I 
remember doing it and just going...

18:07.622 --> 18:16.412
And the head yell at the time, Jeff Bailey comes up 
and is like, oh, you got him, Ricky. That was a good

18:16.753 --> 18:17.754
joke. And so then I was like, oh, yeah, it was. And so 
then we teach the other one. And so I taught the

18:22.759 --> 18:23.640
other one. But we got in a lot of trouble that night. 
Because I wasn't the only one that messed up. The

18:28.245 --> 18:30.128
other junior messed up as well. And so we got in 
trouble that night. The ride home was not fun,

18:35.536 --> 18:39.482
let's put it that way. Oh, for you sophomores. I 
mean, you juniors. Yeah, the ride home wasn't fun.

18:43.447 --> 18:44.228
Because we messed up. The seniors didn't mess up. 
If the seniors would have messed up, then we would

18:45.230 --> 18:47.353
have been okay. But the seniors didn't mess up, and 
we did. And so it was bad. But it was a learning

18:52.440 --> 18:54.203
experience. It was one of those, I never messed up a 
yell again. I was always... Oh, I'm about to

18:57.127 --> 19:00.392
sneeze. Um... It was always one of those things 
where whenever you did mess up you always learned

19:02.485 --> 19:07.696
from it and you always made sure not to do it again. 
Alright, let's see, did you ever though running

19:07.716 --> 19:13.307
across the field somewhere fall? Oh, many times. 
Oh man, I can remember one time definitely that

19:17.842 --> 19:35.462
especially during midnight yell practice was the 
worst just because all the juniors would be down on

19:17.842 --> 19:35.462
the field so I remember one time doing a yell or 
singing the Spirit of Aggieland and then

19:17.842 --> 19:35.462
finishing and then whooping and just turning 
around and running and I mean right when I did it

19:17.842 --> 19:35.462
this guy and we just went all over the entire track 
other times during the during games obviously

19:35.442 --> 19:53.383
you're just sprinting i mean you're running as 
fast as you can to go down to behind the goal post

19:35.442 --> 19:53.383
when we score and i can remember times just taking 
out a media person i mean just bullying right over

19:35.442 --> 19:53.383
them and just being like sorry and running on um Did 
any old time former students ever try to give you or

19:53.920 --> 19:59.811
your buddies any advice on how to do? The yell 
themselves? How to lead, be a yell leader? Um,

20:03.778 --> 20:05.341
yeah, of course they did. Everyone always, 
especially, It's funny, the old Yale leaders

20:07.792 --> 20:11.721
wouldn't say as much as old students. Oh, okay. Old 
students feel like, and this is just A&M, old

20:13.064 --> 20:20.901
students that were just here and saw it feel like 
that they know more about it than, let's say,

20:13.064 --> 20:20.901
someone who actually did it. Not because they 
think that in their mind, but we got more people

20:21.963 --> 20:27.235
giving us advice that were never Yale leaders. 
What did they think you ought to do more of or less

20:27.215 --> 20:30.740
of? Well, just depending on the yell. They said do 
this yell more, do this yell not more, change this

20:32.482 --> 20:39.571
yell, do this differently, why don't you do this 
anymore, why do you do this now? People have a hard

20:42.054 --> 20:45.238
time with change, especially here. Are there any 
yells that they said used to be done that aren't

20:45.539 --> 20:49.704
being done anymore? Yeah, there's a lot. We 
actually have a yell book from the 1920s. Wow. that

20:55.970 --> 20:59.835
one of my friends had that we looked through, and 
there's just a lot of yells in there that we don't do

20:55.970 --> 20:59.835
anymore. It's funny. Back to any other funny 
moments, goofy moments in the first year? Man,

21:10.410 --> 21:14.095
there are so many, and I was trying to think of them 
today. I wish I could have gone back through and

21:14.195 --> 21:16.037
looked at stuff. The Hawaii trip was really fun, 
just because I remember this. No one really

21:22.426 --> 21:24.829
laughed at this except us, but in Hawaii... We 
didn't have a lot of money and so we didn't want to go

21:25.923 --> 21:36.603
and spend so we did a lot of going and buying stuff at 
convenience stores and bringing it back to our

21:25.923 --> 21:36.603
room and just sitting in on our room and just being 
loud and crazy there. We were on like the 12th floor

21:37.023 --> 21:48.184
of this hotel room and if this was the street then 
this right here was where our hotel was and our room

21:37.023 --> 21:48.184
was right here and so you're about there on the 
street mid balconies and we We would get toilet

21:49.548 --> 21:54.013
paper and we'd make spitballs about that big. And 
then we'd just get a running start in the room and

21:54.494 --> 21:58.439
just chunk them out onto the street. And you'd hit 
cars going by. You'd hit pedestrians down on the

22:00.341 --> 22:02.543
street. We did that for literally about four 
hours. Just sat there and just threw spitballs.

22:07.970 --> 22:13.376
They weren't spitballs, but they were water 
balls, I guess you could call them. That was a lot of

22:13.396 --> 22:14.157
fun. That was really funny. There's And by then, 
I'm gathering that... Yeah, we were very close.

22:24.565 --> 22:25.907
You're pulling together. Yeah, we definitely are 
pulling together. And were you supportive when

22:27.749 --> 22:31.454
anybody had a personal problem? Did the other Yale 
leaders... Very supportive. Something that I

22:33.837 --> 22:46.032
think, in my opinion, was one of the big steps that 
happened for us was when, after the first game

22:33.837 --> 22:46.032
against Tulsa that year, we played Tulsa for first 
Yale. Mm-hmm. I think that's right. Didn't we play

22:48.538 --> 22:49.339
Tulsa? I don't know if you can remember. I think we 
were. I think we played Tulsa. Anyway, our first

22:53.363 --> 22:57.108
home game that year, the first jail weekend, we 
won. Fish came down and tackled us and picked us up.

23:00.372 --> 23:08.602
Well, in between Kyle Field and Fish Pond, they 
ripped my uniform off me because they were told

23:00.372 --> 23:08.602
somehow that that was a good bull because since I 
was the non-reg. This is your senior year? This is

23:10.144 --> 23:10.965
my junior year. Oh, your junior year. My junior 
year. That was something good to do. It was a good

23:13.808 --> 23:15.310
bull to do. So they ripped my uniform off me. Well, I 
get to Fish Pond, and I don't have a shirt on. I mean,

23:20.353 --> 23:24.459
I have my undershirt on, but I don't have my yell 
leader uniform on. And my pants are all torn and

23:24.980 --> 23:27.524
stuff like that. And Jeff, people were just like, 
what happened? I was like, the fish ripped my

23:31.289 --> 23:33.072
uniform off me. And they just, I mean, they were 
livid. Supposedly the next morning in Duncan, or

23:36.156 --> 23:43.947
the next Monday morning in Duncan, Jeff Bailey 
stood up and gave a talk that... People have said

23:45.395 --> 23:51.721
we'll go down as the biggest chewing, ass chewing 
that they've heard in Duncan Dining Hall since

23:45.395 --> 23:51.721
they've been in school. Just about that they 
shouldn't do that. And so that, one, I think it, I

23:54.824 --> 23:58.647
didn't make a big stink of it. I didn't go to the 
battalion. I didn't go to my friends on Northside.

24:02.330 --> 24:04.492
I didn't do any of that and said, look at what these 
CTs are doing. I just was like, that's an

24:05.293 --> 24:08.176
unfortunate situation, you know. I didn't really 
know how to handle it. I remember being really

24:10.057 --> 24:11.018
hurt. I remember leaving that going. Why am I doing 
this? Why am I trying? Why am I doing all this? And it

24:16.390 --> 24:17.992
turned out fine. And so that was really good. I 
think that was a big step up for us, just as far as

24:19.113 --> 24:22.656
trusting the other person. All right. Now, by 
this, your junior year, you're so busy that you

24:23.938 --> 24:31.666
don't have many free weekends to travel much. Did 
you go out of town much other than Yell Eater? Not

24:36.831 --> 24:38.012
that I can remember. Where did you and your buddies 
go just to have a good time on Saturday night? We

24:42.989 --> 24:45.053
went to a couple places actually. Sophomore year, 
we went to a place called the Ptarmigan, which was a

24:45.074 --> 24:50.405
bar over in Bryan on South College. We go to 
P-T-A-R. P-T-A-R, Ptarmigan, I guess you could so

24:51.027 --> 24:56.779
call it. My junior year, we went to a lot of houses, I 
remember, just because a lot of my friends weren't

24:58.109 --> 25:04.679
21 yet, even though I was 21. Northgate, I became 
much more a frequenter of Northgate simply

25:04.799 --> 25:10.187
because I turned 21 somewhere before my junior 
year. So my friends and I, we'd go to Northgate. I

25:13.171 --> 25:15.915
never really went to the chicken a lot, amazingly 
enough. People always talk about the Dixie

25:16.165 --> 25:17.586
chicken. I never really started frequenting the 
chicken until this year. Now I go a lot. But then I

25:21.811 --> 25:23.692
never really went. How common was underage 
drinking publicly? Very common. It's cut down a

25:29.398 --> 25:30.960
lot in the past couple years. It's still done all 
over the place. But it's cut down a lot simply

25:33.722 --> 25:37.967
because TABC has kicked up a lot more. How often 
during those years did people really get drunk? A

25:44.296 --> 25:44.777
lot. A lot. And they were drinking beer? 
Sometimes. It depended on where you were. The

25:50.686 --> 25:51.447
chicken, yes. All you do is drink beer. You go to 
places like Dudley's, you drink beer. You go to

25:55.173 --> 26:01.062
places like the Dry Bean Saloon, that's just a shot 
bar. So there's really not... And was it whiskey?

26:03.907 --> 26:04.287
Depended. I mean, it was everything from whiskey 
to there's a couple shots that have huge stories

26:04.328 --> 26:08.975
that go with them. I mean, there's a lot of stuff. 
And how often did you, were you aware there were

26:12.157 --> 26:16.441
some people doing drugs? Actually, drugs were 
never done on Northgate that I always saw. When

26:20.646 --> 26:22.788
people would do drugs, they'd do them at houses. 
They'd do them at parties. I never saw hardcore

26:24.510 --> 26:25.851
drugs. I would see marijuana a lot. But I never 
really saw any hardcore drugs. Marijuana, you

26:31.357 --> 26:32.458
could just smell it. So you'd know what was going 
on. As far as you know, where were people buying the

26:34.039 --> 26:37.683
marijuana? From other students. Here in town? 
Yeah, here in town. How was it coming to town? I know

26:47.197 --> 26:48.640
a lot of my friends that did it. They would get it 
from students that went to Blinn. But were the

26:53.711 --> 26:57.799
Blinn students buying it from somebody? I have no 
idea. I never got that. I didn't do that, so I never,

27:00.757 --> 27:04.463
I just kind of steered clear of all that stuff. And 
what would be your guess as to what percentage of

27:05.325 --> 27:12.036
students today smoke cigarettes, tobacco? Smoke 
cigarettes? I'd say a whole lot of people do every

27:13.759 --> 27:17.005
once in a while. Not as a habit, but I'd say people 
do, I'd say 40% of students Do it every once in a

27:23.909 --> 27:25.298
while? Do Aggie women smoke as much as Aggie, in 
percentages, as much as Aggie men? The ones that I

27:31.233 --> 27:32.454
hang around do. Or is it more? No, it's the same. 
It's the same. But see, I don't hang around anyone

27:37.699 --> 27:40.201
that smokes all the time. Like I don't have any 
smoker friends. But yet if we go out, we'll go out to

27:42.263 --> 27:49.430
Northgate one night and someone will buy a pack of 
cigarettes and 20 of us will have a cigarette

27:42.263 --> 27:49.430
together, you know. Are there some places here in 
the Bryan area that students go to that are clearly

27:49.710 --> 27:56.236
dangerous for them? Martin Luther King and Bryan, 
Martin Luther King Boulevard and Bryan. It's

28:01.253 --> 28:02.174
really dangerous. Okay. I think it's pretty 
dangerous for women at night anywhere. Anywhere.

28:08.940 --> 28:14.145
Especially, I mean, it always, I always don't know 
why, but I always see girls jogging at night on

28:08.940 --> 28:14.145
campus. It just scares the trash out of me. I just, I 
don't even know why. It's dumb. It is very dumb. As

28:20.851 --> 28:26.397
much as we want to think that this is a really nice 
place and there's no bad people, I mean, that's

28:20.851 --> 28:26.397
just not true. That's just not true at all. Now, 
you've heard the old legends about La Grange. The

28:31.156 --> 28:33.118
best little... The best little whorehouse? Oh, 
sure. Now, there is nothing like that anywhere. As

28:38.644 --> 28:40.366
far as whorehouses? Not that I know of. There's 
nothing like that anywhere now. Not that I know of,

28:44.770 --> 28:45.711
no. And I don't think you'd be surprised. No one I 
have interviewed knows anybody that actually

28:48.454 --> 28:53.499
went to LaGrange. They heard people did, but they 
don't know anybody. Of course not. Why would you

28:57.624 --> 28:59.245
know anybody who went to LaGrange? All right, 
did... How did that affect your participation in

29:01.767 --> 29:09.195
religious activities?

29:09.833 --> 29:12.777
brought it down, honestly, just because I didn't 
have the time to go do it. Like, I'd be doing, I'd go

29:12.817 --> 29:17.563
and speak to organizations on Tuesday nights, so I 
wouldn't be able to go to Breakaway, per se. I

29:18.163 --> 29:25.913
wouldn't, I wasn't able to, I didn't have the 
opportunity to participate in a Bible study

29:18.163 --> 29:25.913
through Ecumenical Club, the organization I was 
in. I was out of town a lot on Sundays. In terms of

29:28.476 --> 29:32.922
values, your code of ethics and so forth, Did you 
come to realize that your fellow Yale leaders were

29:33.256 --> 29:37.501
similar? Very similar, which was really neat. It 
was actually a big encouragement when I did find

29:40.485 --> 29:44.790
that out. It helped a lot. I actually live with one 
of the senior Yale leaders now. He's my roommate.

29:51.998 --> 29:53.360
And were all of you Anglos? Yes. Actually now, oh 
no, no, actually there was a Catholic. There was a

30:00.610 --> 30:01.331
Catholic. Okay. Yeah. Okay. The, all right, that 
junior year as a Yale leader, when the year is over,

30:03.293 --> 30:13.085
what had happened to your GPA compared to the 
previous years? It had gone down like a point, like

30:13.525 --> 30:16.028
point one. Oh, point one, not a full point. No, no, 
no, like a tenth of a point. Okay. Still above

30:19.753 --> 30:20.413
three? Yeah, I still, it's still above three right 
now. Okay. I, the first time I had ever gotten below

30:22.976 --> 30:25.960
three was last fall. All right. Then you ran for 
senior yell leader in that spring. Describe that

30:33.572 --> 30:34.713
campaign. That campaign, well, first off, 
something that really neat happened was the Corps

30:35.373 --> 30:46.744
didn't run anyone against me, which to my 
knowledge is the first time that that's ever

30:35.373 --> 30:46.744
happened, that the Corps of Cadets has not put up 
five people. Why didn't they? I don't know. You

30:48.946 --> 30:53.230
know, everybody has kind of their thoughts on it. 
If I were trying to toot my own horn, I'd say, well,

30:54.644 --> 31:00.691
they liked me so much and they liked the job that I 
did that they wanted me to be there again. But I

31:00.751 --> 31:02.793
don't think that's necessarily true. I think it 
was a combination of them seeing, okay, he did the

31:02.833 --> 31:09.280
job, he knows how to do the job the best, and why 
wouldn't we want to re-elect that? And also, they

31:09.801 --> 31:14.125
didn't think that they could, they wouldn't be 
able to put someone up that could beat me. Alright,

31:14.305 --> 31:23.976
as far as you know, who is it in the Corps that 
decides who is going to run for what from the Corps?

31:24.057 --> 31:25.926
Originally, it's called core block. I mean, I know 
the answer. Core. Core block. Block. Mm-hmm. They

31:31.152 --> 31:32.076
go out to parties.
