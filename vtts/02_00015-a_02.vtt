WEBVTT

00:03.035 --> 00:09.750
And so the whole understanding of all of veterinary medicine has changed.

00:10.151 --> 00:17.989
The importance of livestock, the food animal type of animal is

00:18.323 --> 00:19.884
that has radically changed.

00:19.924 --> 00:21.346
It isn't the single cow.

00:21.366 --> 00:25.249
Of course, I came from dairy country, and you came down to beef country.

00:25.289 --> 00:27.131
So this is a very different scenario.

00:27.852 --> 00:36.920
And the tendency then, when I came here at first, was, well, you kind of worked on a herd basis, not an individual.

00:37.400 --> 00:44.467
But every rancher still had Bessie, who was his favorite, and he would still do anything for Bessie.

00:44.507 --> 00:48.330
She may not have had a cow in 10 years, but she was still

00:48.310 --> 00:52.065
Someday she'd have that real winner.

00:52.085 --> 00:58.371
The production animal has changed.

00:59.752 --> 01:03.238
The focus on the herd has changed.

01:03.258 --> 01:09.828
We talked about herd health when I went to school, but it truly has become more of a herd health situation.

01:10.269 --> 01:22.909
Even in small animals, you talk to people who have catteries or who raise a lot of puppies, not necessarily a lot, but they want good puppies and they want them going to good homes.

01:24.351 --> 01:26.755
You're talking herd health issues.

01:27.123 --> 01:31.072
The importance of food safety has changed dramatically.

01:31.372 --> 01:33.076
Yes, I didn't want to get sick.

01:33.437 --> 01:35.321
Yes, I wanted pasteurized milk.

01:35.401 --> 01:37.646
That's what the old school said.

01:38.147 --> 01:41.875
And we did the California mastitis milk test and so on.

01:42.617 --> 01:47.427
Now you're talking big production medicine, you're talking

01:47.407 --> 02:15.422
from the farm to the table types of programs which we did we knew we were part of as veterinarians but we never thought of it even as small animal practitioners we didn't we didn't have a role in food safety and we do now we do now now early in your clinical experience here the prime you said it was more dogs than cats and they were from what kind of a region

02:15.605 --> 02:18.038
They were very much local.

02:18.423 --> 02:20.126
They lived in the backyard.

02:20.166 --> 02:23.210
The cats were in and out.

02:23.510 --> 02:26.916
They may come in to eat, but they spent most of their time outside.

02:27.737 --> 02:46.945
And they had names like Spot and Tippy and Fido and Fluffy, but they weren't, it wasn't Susie and Janie and King and Rachel, and it wasn't the humanized names that we often see now.

02:47.448 --> 02:55.568
The cats didn't come in much, maybe for shots.

02:56.324 --> 03:01.812
But we just came into understanding a little bit about heartworm disease.

03:01.852 --> 03:04.857
That was relatively new, although it certainly existed.

03:04.937 --> 03:07.641
And I remember learning about it as a student.

03:07.661 --> 03:10.966
Heartworm preventatives came about treating heartworms.

03:11.467 --> 03:20.020
Spending $200 on a dog was just absolutely outrageous.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.425
broken legs, if you can fix it, simply maybe.

03:25.086 --> 03:27.528
But many times it was euthanasia.

03:28.669 --> 03:32.213
Now, money is still an issue.

03:32.474 --> 03:38.460
We still deal with economics much more so than our physician colleagues have to.

03:39.561 --> 03:45.207
Insurance, third-party paying, is very different than it is in human medicine.

03:46.008 --> 03:48.471
I've watched insurance rise

03:49.312 --> 03:51.695
Probably about three times in cycles.

03:52.576 --> 03:54.438
We're coming into a new cycle of it.

03:54.519 --> 03:57.022
It's a different approach than has been used before.

03:57.783 --> 04:00.286
And this one stands a chance, perhaps.

04:00.386 --> 04:07.074
So it's interesting to watch outside influences on the economics that drive our profession.

04:07.775 --> 04:13.142
Describe some of the unusual animals that you've seen over the years.

04:14.371 --> 04:18.219
The most unusual was the elephant Mai Tai, and that was as a student.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.384
Do you have any idea how to spell Mai Tai?

04:20.424 --> 04:21.506
No, it's like the drink.

04:22.067 --> 04:24.513
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

04:25.054 --> 04:28.281
And when I was a student, Mai Tai had swallowed a rock.

04:28.561 --> 04:29.403
This is in Minnesota?

04:29.423 --> 04:30.726
In Minnesota.

04:31.027 --> 04:36.055
And the rock got stuck in her throat about this far down.

04:36.075 --> 04:42.224
I had to put my, they saw a long skinny arm coming and they said, get over here.

04:42.265 --> 04:47.713
And we were not able to successfully get the rock out of the elephant, unfortunately.

04:48.134 --> 04:59.211
And that was one of my first experiences, really understanding compassion with the animal, the human-animal bond as it has now come to be known.

05:00.693 --> 05:09.817
Over time, I don't have any single individual animal that stands out.

05:12.724 --> 05:14.730
But there must have been some unusual animals.

05:14.810 --> 05:16.474
I was just wondering what variety.

05:17.669 --> 05:22.475
Well, we saw, we were primarily limited to the dogs and cats.

05:23.176 --> 05:35.212
And so, oh, we'd hear about an elephant that was over there or a llama that was over in, usually they were stuck in a large animal cage or, you know, the exotic animals that would come in.

05:35.273 --> 05:36.935
There would be a lion, we'd have to go see that.

05:36.995 --> 05:40.099
One of the big tortoises, we'd go see that.

05:40.737 --> 05:45.123
an ostrich that would come in before they became popular.

05:45.183 --> 05:52.694
So the exotic animals to go and see them because people weren't doing that very much unless you kind of got forced into it.

05:54.818 --> 05:57.902
The more interesting things would be

05:58.490 --> 06:10.079
a dog or cat that would be brought in more for a particular behavior problem or something that was unusual and the owners would be so embarrassed to talk about.

06:10.119 --> 06:12.565
And how do you bring them out and talk about it?

06:12.585 --> 06:14.710
And to watch the students' faces.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.011
Can you give some examples?

06:16.331 --> 06:16.973
It's hard to.

06:17.233 --> 06:29.982
I was trying to think of, well, probably the most embarrassing from student and owner perspective would be a dog that would swallow a tampon and then

06:29.962 --> 06:32.465
It would be vomiting, but how do we get it up?

06:32.765 --> 06:33.606
Is it going to pass?

06:33.647 --> 06:34.808
Is it not going to pass?

06:35.289 --> 06:36.069
Well, yes.

06:36.490 --> 06:38.893
OK, let's make it vomit and get it to pass.

06:38.933 --> 06:45.421
And how to keep a straight face when owners would come in and they'd talk about their dog doing it all over the house.

06:45.721 --> 06:47.023
Well, what do you mean doing it?

06:47.123 --> 06:54.933
Well, what they meant was it was defecating all over the house, but they couldn't use the word until you gave them permission by saying it's OK.

06:55.654 --> 06:56.434
You mean defecating?

06:56.475 --> 06:58.517
Oh, yes, defecating all over the house.

06:58.497 --> 07:02.031
So they'd be so embarrassed to talk about, particularly men.

07:02.914 --> 07:07.613
Or the dog that would be mounting the owner's leg and

07:09.061 --> 07:11.785
They didn't have the words to describe what was going on.

07:12.205 --> 07:17.733
And the students are trying to hold back laughter because this is really serious to the owner.

07:18.514 --> 07:32.513
And there'd be some times you'd go out of the exam room and you'd have to go to the farthest quiet room in the building because you knew you were going to just break out laughing because it really was a funny story when you put it in the total context.

07:32.533 --> 07:34.275
But it was very important to the owner.

07:34.711 --> 07:46.527
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, all of this effort in the clinic was done in the setting as a teaching experience for the students.

07:46.658 --> 07:47.420
Absolutely.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.203
Students are very, very important.

07:49.224 --> 07:55.056
But this was not primarily to serve the public and to cure their animal.

07:55.457 --> 07:58.904
It was that plus this other.

07:58.924 --> 07:59.706
They were equal.

08:00.608 --> 08:02.191
It was always an equal thing.

08:04.256 --> 08:07.182
We have had clients that will come in and say,

08:08.731 --> 08:13.076
I want to see the doctor, I don't want a resident or intern, and I don't want students.

08:14.577 --> 08:23.467
And we kindly explained to them, either you have the students or you are welcome to leave because the students are A&M.

08:24.107 --> 08:25.149
Does anyone ever leave?

08:25.209 --> 08:28.512
We have never had anyone that I can remember leave.

08:28.532 --> 08:29.914
I've never heard of it.

08:30.314 --> 08:35.920
After a while they kind of settle down and they find out, you know, it's really kind of fun to have the students around.

08:36.608 --> 08:41.880
Now surely there must have been some goofy requests that some pet owner has made.

08:41.900 --> 08:56.271
The one that tore me apart potentially the most, we had a lady that had come in and she brought in a dog that had

08:57.955 --> 08:59.561
a serious skin problem.

08:59.581 --> 09:02.512
The whole skin was affected and we weren't sure what it was.

09:02.573 --> 09:04.058
We had some ideas when she came in.

09:04.901 --> 09:09.298
But this was a dog she had found on the side of the road and it was a

09:10.747 --> 09:13.832
Not a young puppy, but not a mature dog in between.

09:14.713 --> 09:21.264
And she, when we diagnosed, she wanted it worked up and the skin problem turned out to be demodex mange.

09:21.805 --> 09:32.442
And we talked to her about treatment and she decided because of the cost of it and because of the difficulty in doing it, she chose to euthanize the dog.

09:32.462 --> 09:34.746
And that wasn't necessarily a wrong decision.

09:35.587 --> 09:42.717
Within a week, she had come in with a second dog, which she had also found on the side of the road.

09:43.659 --> 09:46.102
And this dog had a tumor.

09:46.984 --> 09:48.005
That's what she thought it was.

09:48.085 --> 09:49.727
There was a bump over the hip.

09:50.709 --> 09:55.135
Well, in feeling it, it became quite obvious that this wasn't a tumor.

09:55.215 --> 09:56.778
There was a bone under there.

09:57.719 --> 09:59.782
And this dog had a fractured leg.

10:01.745 --> 10:05.290
She was going to take this dog home

10:06.181 --> 10:09.106
and just leave the leg, not fix it.

10:10.389 --> 10:13.515
And here's where the humaneness comes in again.

10:13.735 --> 10:19.947
I can't let this lady walk out this door with this dog, obviously in pain, broken leg.

10:21.009 --> 10:23.052
So we started scrambling to see.

10:23.553 --> 10:25.557
And the irony was

10:25.537 --> 10:29.683
The lady had diamonds that were huge as baseballs.

10:29.703 --> 10:34.570
She was driving a brand new Cadillac Mercedes, some big kind of car.

10:34.950 --> 10:39.236
But she said, my husband won't let me spend the money.

10:39.717 --> 10:40.818
So we had to work.

10:40.838 --> 10:42.100
And we were fortunate.

10:42.260 --> 10:48.069
We were able to find some funds, were able to get the animal fixed properly.

10:48.850 --> 10:52.675
She was humane with one dog.

10:52.655 --> 10:56.861
but was going to let another one go around with a broken leg.

10:56.961 --> 11:00.046
So we were able to get it fixed, and it was one of those feel goods.

11:00.086 --> 11:03.971
We were able to do the right thing for the animal for the right reasons.

11:04.712 --> 11:09.339
Now, surely there must have been some truly goofy request by some owner.

11:10.801 --> 11:11.662
Can you do this?

11:11.782 --> 11:13.785
Can you change that?

11:15.723 --> 11:20.738
There are a lot of owners that will come in with totally unrealistic diagnoses.

11:20.819 --> 11:22.825
They have already decided what it is.

11:23.487 --> 11:26.055
There's no way you're going to change their mind.

11:26.155 --> 11:29.766
And I'm trying to think of specific ones, and I can't.

11:30.944 --> 11:38.956
The lump I guess, they come in, the concern, well I can't think of the funny ones.

11:40.098 --> 11:43.383
I can think of the ones that jerk your heart strings.

11:45.045 --> 11:46.367
Well what are some of those?

11:46.387 --> 11:49.071
Well the dog that comes in,

11:51.548 --> 11:56.394
It's not uncommon to see a dog come in for a yearly exam.

11:57.275 --> 12:03.102
And what we notice are the lymph nodes that are superficial are huge.

12:03.322 --> 12:04.404
They're just huge.

12:04.824 --> 12:11.913
And that almost is a pathognomonic for tumor lymphoma.

12:11.933 --> 12:13.815
The dog's dying, and it won't be long.

12:14.195 --> 12:15.497
But the dog doesn't feel bad.

12:15.477 --> 12:17.422
The owner has not seen this.

12:17.442 --> 12:27.529
And we pointed out on the exam, and this is one of these situations where you have to be real careful and say, you can't say, oh, you brought it in healthy, but it's dying.

12:28.049 --> 12:48.355
So you've got to take your samples and you say, well, we're going to send them off to the pathologist to buy a couple of days' time for them to think about it, point out these huge baseball-sized lymph nodes, and say, you know, one of the bad things it could be would be cancer, so that they can start thinking about what ultimately may happen.

12:48.996 --> 12:56.385
And many of them choose not to treat for several reasons, but they may treat with, we can use the steroids, the cortisones.

12:56.737 --> 12:59.320
to help shrink them, make them feel a little bit better.

12:59.641 --> 13:05.648
But many of those are dying and are euthanized within a couple of weeks of our finding it.

13:05.988 --> 13:10.494
So they bring in a healthy dog, and within a few weeks we've got a dead animal.

13:11.755 --> 13:19.605
And surely you all must have had some experience of treating the pet of some high-profile people.

13:20.429 --> 13:28.419
Yeah, the most high profile that I personally was involved with was Lyle Leavitt, had a cab.

13:29.461 --> 13:30.963
I didn't know who Lyle Leavitt was.

13:32.064 --> 13:34.828
Everyone was, oh, Lyle Leavitt's coming in, Lyle Leavitt's coming in.

13:35.409 --> 13:38.332
Okay, that's nice, whoever that is.

13:38.673 --> 13:40.355
Oh, he's a country western singer.

13:40.375 --> 13:41.977
Okay, I'll take your word for it.

13:42.858 --> 13:47.905
And he came in, and of course, the first impression is, here's this funny hairdo.

13:49.049 --> 13:59.906
So it was a cat that had a nerve paralysis on the leg, had been there quite a while, and it was the type of thing you recommend amputation, and cats could care less.

14:00.627 --> 14:03.832
And so to confirm the diagnosis and so on.

14:03.932 --> 14:16.491
So I'm in working with Lyle Leavitt, and everybody's, you know, the window has 1,000 faces plastered to it, and all the students in there are falling all over themselves because they're working with Lyle Leavitt, and it's like,

14:17.028 --> 14:19.872
OK, so go on and do my thing.

14:20.112 --> 14:20.873
Don't you know who he is?

14:20.993 --> 14:21.193
No.

14:21.654 --> 14:23.877
Subsequently, I've learned who Lyle Leavitt is.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.843
That's one of several.

14:29.284 --> 14:32.207
What was he like as a pet owner?

14:32.428 --> 14:33.549
He's a very nice person.

14:34.150 --> 14:36.913
He's just a normal human being like all of us are.

14:38.635 --> 14:39.897
And that's one thing that I've

14:40.855 --> 14:53.908
I have never been enamored by celebrities, because usually I find out they're normal people like everybody else, and there's no reason to go goo-goo-ga-ga over them.

14:54.589 --> 14:57.492
I've always appreciated them for the people that they are.

14:57.652 --> 15:04.399
Now, surely there must have been university presidents, pets, regents?

15:04.419 --> 15:07.522
Well, Reveille is the one that we deal with the most.

15:07.543 --> 15:07.603
Oh.

15:07.623 --> 15:08.203
Reveille.

15:08.443 --> 15:09.985
Share some Reveille stories.

15:11.956 --> 15:25.136
The Reveille stories that I remember, I don't know, it must be five, was brought in one time because of vomiting.

15:25.156 --> 15:29.102
And Dr. Hall wasn't there, so Dr. Beaver got to see Reveille.

15:29.362 --> 15:30.384
Well, okay.

15:31.826 --> 15:40.579
As it turns out, it was probably a good thing Dr. Beaver did see Reveille because Reveille got stressed very easily.

15:40.897 --> 15:55.081
You could always tell when it was the first football season, or the first game of the season, or the first time that she was really back on campus with thousands of people around her, because she would get stressed and she would start vomiting.

15:55.682 --> 15:59.649
Plus the fact probably a lot of people were feeding her things she didn't need to have fed.

15:59.669 --> 16:03.495
So OK, let's just do the.

16:03.948 --> 16:15.987
don't feed her for a while, and just kind of the standard protocol on one that is a little stressed, back off, give her a chance, let her be alone for a while, just to give her some calm time.

16:16.949 --> 16:22.598
Any governor, senator, wealthy person?

16:23.405 --> 16:25.607
Not that I have dealt with specific.

16:25.767 --> 16:28.831
Well, I'm sure that they have, but I haven't known who they were.

16:29.631 --> 16:40.623
I know someone called from the state veterinary office saying that Senator so-and-so was sending a dog or a cat over, you know, treat them with VIP gloves.

16:40.963 --> 16:49.412
And I can remember talking to the veterinarian who was actually going to be seeing the case, and it was George Lees in that one situation.

16:49.747 --> 16:52.210
George said, we treat them all like VIPs.

16:52.250 --> 16:53.672
Why should I be any different?

16:53.692 --> 16:54.913
And he's absolutely right.

16:55.273 --> 16:56.034
It doesn't matter.

16:59.258 --> 17:10.932
Describe for me again, naive, what are the staffing of the clinic?

17:12.273 --> 17:13.755
What kind of shifts do you work?

17:13.795 --> 17:15.237
How many people are there?

17:15.917 --> 17:16.638
How long?

17:16.959 --> 17:18.100
How many days a week?

17:19.092 --> 17:23.604
The staffing has evolved in the clinic considerably in the time that I've been here.

17:23.965 --> 17:26.071
What was it like when compared then and now?

17:26.091 --> 17:33.270
Well, then there were no technicians, so the clinician had

17:33.942 --> 17:41.075
depending on four to six students usually, sometimes maybe even more than that because there weren't a lot of clinicians.

17:42.217 --> 17:43.780
If you did medicine, you did medicine.

17:43.900 --> 17:46.545
It didn't matter what kind of medicine, everything that walked in the door.

17:46.565 --> 17:53.858
If you did surgery, you either got the referrals for surgery or medicine people sent you the surgery cases.

17:54.378 --> 17:58.906
We did have, Ned Elliott was doing ophthalmology, so that was kind of the one thing that was a little separate.

17:59.166 --> 18:00.689
But he did a lot of the medicine, too.

18:01.450 --> 18:07.500
Gene Gowing was here, and what a master of the art of veterinary medicine.

18:08.442 --> 18:15.053
And I can always remember, we would page overhead when a clinician had a phone call.

18:16.079 --> 18:21.407
And Gene, because he couldn't hear as well, they called him doctor number 13.

18:21.447 --> 18:25.172
He could understand that one, but he couldn't hear gowing as well.

18:26.594 --> 18:35.607
Now we have each service has technicians, and we have seven medicine services and five

18:38.303 --> 18:40.725
I believe it is, surgery services.

18:40.805 --> 18:51.135
So it has expanded horrendously over that time with technical support for all of them, plus a few other technicians in various areas.

18:51.175 --> 19:00.704
We also have the exotic animal services, which take care of the critters that nobody knows anything about except them.

19:01.825 --> 19:08.091
Now, when we have to draw blood, we can have the technician help the student learn.

19:08.543 --> 19:16.350
We're buried in paperwork, so the clinician can spend the time getting the paperwork done, making sure that the right protocols are down.

19:17.151 --> 19:25.238
With the litigiousness of society today, we have to be more careful in paperwork than we were back then.

19:25.258 --> 19:28.962
So the paperwork has grown something fierce.

19:29.602 --> 19:34.347
Now, when you first began as a clinician, what was the assignment?

19:34.407 --> 19:35.928
How many hours per week?

19:35.948 --> 19:38.010
And was it an eight-hour shift?

19:38.277 --> 19:41.201
Well, in theory, we're here from 8 to 5.

19:41.842 --> 19:42.744
Now, that's in theory.

19:42.984 --> 19:47.411
Once you're on the clinic floor, you're here probably from 8 till whenever.

19:47.531 --> 19:50.596
And that has always been true.

19:50.656 --> 19:53.200
The time factor has never changed.

19:53.220 --> 19:57.226
You often were assigned early on.

19:57.586 --> 20:01.973
You did emergencies.

20:01.953 --> 20:10.806
a resident covering the emergency that came in or they would call a clinician that was appropriate for whatever kind of emergency it was in, was.

20:12.728 --> 20:27.049
We didn't have, we had students that manned the intensive care area 24 hours, well no, when they were not on the clinic floor, they did the nighttime shifts in ICU.

20:28.210 --> 20:36.297
That was one of the first areas that we brought technicians into so that we would have 24 hours coverage of technicians in ICU.

20:37.694 --> 20:41.161
Then we started getting technicians for the various services.

20:41.522 --> 20:50.820
We always had one or two that kind of covered the what we call community practice area, the outpatient area, which is kind of the local area.

20:51.161 --> 20:54.467
But initially, various clinicians would rotate through.

20:54.567 --> 20:59.517
So Mike Willard, who was really into GI stuff,

20:59.497 --> 21:07.469
was covering and receiving local cases that might be skin or they might be a neuro case or whatever.

21:07.790 --> 21:08.511
He was doing all.

21:08.551 --> 21:14.460
But at other times, he might do that two days a week or two afternoons a week.

21:15.262 --> 21:22.573
But all his emergency and important GI cases were not being covered while he was covering the local ones.

21:23.334 --> 21:25.217
So we switched.

21:25.923 --> 21:48.893
back probably around 1990 so that we had specific services and they saw specific types of cases and the local ones went into the community service and that's where I ended up doing kind of the local receiving which made a lot of sense because all the new puppies and kittens came in there for their vaccines too so we could talk to them about

21:48.991 --> 21:55.385
how to grow a good citizen, starting from the time they're a young puppy or a kitten.

21:55.706 --> 22:03.383
Now, you as a professional were then supervising a number of students on that shift.

22:03.584 --> 22:04.105
That's right.

22:04.325 --> 22:06.831
And in the early years it might have been how many?

22:06.811 --> 22:30.827
we are well we usually would have five or six and now five or six oh still yeah and they what year seniors fourth year fourth fourth year all right so that they are comparatively well prepared they're book prepared they're not hands-on prepared and that's the fun of watching them develop

22:30.807 --> 22:47.451
their confidence, not that they have a lot by the time they graduate, but being able to change from the organization they use to remember their book knowledge into the organizational skills they were going to need to think, well, you know, what are the differentials for a vomiting dog?

22:48.773 --> 22:53.760
What are the differentials for this kind of, you know, an itchy skin disease?

22:54.162 --> 23:12.409
to kind of watch them and make them go through this process of reorganizing their thought processes and actually draw on this knowledge and not have to put it down in a multiple choice test, but on the multiple choice everyday type of test that they've got.

23:12.609 --> 23:22.363
Can you remember any, I know you won't believe it, sort of examples of a diagnosis by a student that was way, way, way off the mark?

23:23.440 --> 23:27.085
I was going to say most of them are off the mark, but they're not.

23:30.630 --> 23:36.418
Yes, there are a number of them that will come in particularly early in the year.

23:37.439 --> 23:42.025
And they go through a history, and there's kind of a set history form.

23:42.045 --> 23:44.869
It doesn't say ask this question, this question, this question.

23:45.330 --> 23:48.134
But you ask about what is the chief complaint?

23:48.835 --> 23:52.840
What is the history of that complaint?

23:53.107 --> 23:54.548
Problems have they noticed?

23:55.269 --> 23:56.531
What surgeries have they had?

23:56.591 --> 23:57.832
What medicines are they on?

23:58.733 --> 24:00.515
And then you've got a systems review.

24:00.835 --> 24:03.238
Are they coughing, sneezing, vomiting?

24:03.258 --> 24:04.879
And you just ask general questions.

24:05.400 --> 24:13.128
Well, as early in their senior year, they come in and they go through this list.

24:13.748 --> 24:16.091
And they find out the dog is here for vaccinations.

24:16.431 --> 24:18.894
And they go through any vomiting, diarrhea.

24:19.174 --> 24:22.978
Yeah, the dog's been vomiting for the last, you know,

24:23.397 --> 24:24.018
Three days.

24:25.541 --> 24:27.103
It's been a little depressed, yes.

24:27.504 --> 24:40.447
So they come out and they tell us, they're here to vaccinate the dog, so we need to vaccinate him with this and then they come back in three weeks and they get this and then they'll come back in another three weeks and get the third shot.

24:40.888 --> 24:48.561
And it's like, does the fact that they're vomiting have anything to do, could that mean that we might not want to vaccinate him?

24:48.946 --> 24:49.947
Oh, I don't know.

24:49.967 --> 24:51.149
How long have they been vomiting?

24:51.169 --> 24:52.390
Well, I didn't ask that.

24:53.292 --> 24:54.693
Well, what does the vomitous look like?

24:54.794 --> 24:55.855
I have no idea.

24:57.978 --> 25:06.188
The fact that the animal comes in and they have parvo disease and shouldn't even be near a vaccine, they totally miss it.

25:07.069 --> 25:13.738
And it's like, what do you mean the dog's been vomiting for three days and you've just walked out through the hospital without

25:13.887 --> 25:15.789
you know, sanitizing your feet.

25:16.630 --> 25:18.232
Oh, could that be important?

25:18.632 --> 25:19.693
Maybe so.

25:21.054 --> 25:23.097
Maybe so.

25:26.360 --> 25:26.760
Let's see.

25:27.321 --> 25:42.797
As we've gone from an overwhelmingly male to now a female majority in the enrollment, how has that changed the operations of the clinic and the real world of the veterinary school as you see it?

25:45.460 --> 26:13.560
As we've gone, as the number of women have increased, there's actually been a change in the profession overall from going to, from the good old boy stories and mentality to the understanding the science and the depth of the discipline.

26:14.637 --> 26:17.401
It's really been a good thing for veterinary medicine.

26:18.783 --> 26:28.457
While it isn't that the dirty jokes have dried up, that's part of it, and that's been a result, and that's been okay.

26:29.478 --> 26:43.378
But the whole profession, and this may in part be timing rather than gender change, but I think a lot of the women that have come in have been extremely bright,

26:44.438 --> 26:51.210
They realize that when they get out, they often are going to be combining career and family life.

26:52.032 --> 26:54.235
They're not going to have a lot of time.

26:54.296 --> 27:02.811
And so they need to be very organized and disciplined in how they approach it.

27:02.911 --> 27:07.459
And I think it has changed how we approach the profession as a whole.

27:07.912 --> 27:10.595
It's definitely been for the better.

27:10.955 --> 27:30.797
Now, that said, if we look at what happens when they get out, there is truly a concern, which was pointed out in a big study recently published by the American Veterinary Medical Association, which has pointed to the fact the attitude has changed.

27:31.992 --> 27:37.888
Women probably are viewed as more compassionate.

27:39.773 --> 27:40.735
That's not good or bad.

27:41.036 --> 27:42.119
That's just the way it is.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.107
But as a result of that,

27:45.830 --> 27:56.170
the economics of the profession have not kept pace with the economics of comparable professions.

27:56.691 --> 28:02.742
And that probably has to do with, well, I won't charge you for that, or well, I won't charge you so much with it.

28:02.722 --> 28:06.948
We as veterinarians need to get out of the charging business.

28:07.088 --> 28:09.110
That's what office managers can do.

28:09.491 --> 28:14.858
Let me check off what I did on the sheet, let that go into some computer somewhere else.

28:14.898 --> 28:16.860
So I'm divorced from that decision.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.625
That's coming, but we've got a long way to go there.

28:21.406 --> 28:32.661
Now, I'm assuming that compared to 30 years ago, the students today who come into veterinary medicine have higher academic grade point ratios

28:33.637 --> 28:53.456
a deeper, broader, undergraduate program and that they are more urban, they're more urban percentage-wise kids growing up more in the towns and cities than 30 years ago.

28:53.477 --> 28:55.240
That's true.

28:55.709 --> 29:00.035
The students we see reflect changes in society overall.

29:01.317 --> 29:09.187
It's interesting because many of the graduates of today are not interested in the 60 and 80 hour work weeks anymore.

29:09.447 --> 29:12.832
They want an eight to five type of job, five days a week.

29:16.817 --> 29:19.641
Their background is different, therefore,

29:20.363 --> 29:34.355
Just like the clients they serve, they often don't recognize what's normal for dogs and cats and horses and cows, anything else, because they weren't raised around them.

29:34.375 --> 29:40.560
They didn't see lots of them in a non-humanistic perspective.

29:42.002 --> 29:49.408
So animal behavior, which is my discipline, has really grown because they don't know what normal is.

29:50.452 --> 29:52.174
just like the clients they serve.

29:53.216 --> 29:56.039
Conversely, they tend to want to go back to the cities.

29:57.101 --> 30:03.068
They tend not to want to work with large animal, food animal particularly.

30:03.509 --> 30:04.650
They may have a horse background.

30:04.670 --> 30:13.262
They may not have the cattle, swine, poultry, or certainly something like aquaculture, which is really foreign to a lot of them.

30:15.304 --> 30:16.326
That background isn't there.

30:16.946 --> 30:18.248
They reflect society.

30:18.929 --> 30:19.750
They are

30:20.354 --> 30:25.140
Better educated in breadth, but not necessarily in depth.

30:25.740 --> 30:27.202
They are very bright.

30:27.623 --> 30:31.087
There's no way I could even begin to compete with the student of today.

30:33.410 --> 30:42.801
But when they get out, the hands-on, the adaption to the real world,

30:43.304 --> 30:49.671
Those struggles are no different for the new graduate today than they were 30 years ago.

30:50.112 --> 30:55.177
It's a different profession, but the struggles are still the same.

30:56.859 --> 31:04.367
This is an editorial note I remember as dean of faculties in the 70s getting involved on the fringes of a potential lawsuit.

31:05.128 --> 31:12.096
A young lady with an almost perfect 4.0 GPA from UT Austin in biochemistry.
