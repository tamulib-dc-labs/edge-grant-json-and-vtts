00:01.195 --> 00:28.654
date and place of birth wilfred bruce truax i was 
born october 15 1922 in donna texas i went through

00:01.195 --> 00:28.654
school except for the fifth grade all of it there in 
donna the fifth grade i spent one semester in

00:01.195 --> 00:28.654
wisconsin and one semester in Waco, Texas. This 
had come about primarily because our house had

00:34.233 --> 00:40.884
burned that summer before.

00:43.788 --> 00:47.734
Was this a fire of natural origin? No, it came 
about, my dad was always experimenting and trying

00:47.935 --> 00:56.869
to improve things around the house. He was trying 
to get a water heater working and there was an

00:58.486 --> 01:08.158
explosion. He was out in the yard at the time of the 
explosion, but it apparently scattered fuel

01:08.218 --> 01:21.455
pretty good because by the time he turned around, 
the whole house was on fire. This must have been a

01:22.516 --> 01:25.860
fairly unsettling experience for the family. Did 
y'all lose all your possessions? Almost

01:29.917 --> 01:33.562
entirely. My dad got back in as far as the kitchen 
and the only two things I can remember is he pulled

01:34.043 --> 01:48.924
the drawer of the ordinary silverware we used and 
also carried out the electric cooker that we had.

01:50.206 --> 01:54.953
Other than that, why, and then of course a little 
bit of salvage of few pictures and this where they

01:56.148 --> 02:23.758
were in a deep stack that it have burned edges but 
not completely burned up and but nearly

01:56.148 --> 02:23.758
everything else this was of course in the 
depression 33 and it was amazing how good people

01:56.148 --> 02:23.758
were to us we

02:25.072 --> 02:26.935
took us in at various places. We stayed and what 
have you. Well, I think each of the kids' classes, I

02:33.225 --> 02:47.107
know mine specifically did, they all brought 
various things from home or knew. You feel that

02:48.028 --> 02:51.754
people took care of each other more then than they 
do now?

02:54.620 --> 02:57.444
I tend to believe this in a sense. Of course you got 
to keep in mind too though that this is the

02:58.245 --> 03:11.785
difference of a town of 3,000 against

02:58.245 --> 03:11.785
living in 150, 200,000 city.

03:15.310 --> 03:21.319
Everybody tended to be a little closer probably 
and know each other's problems more and This

03:22.244 --> 03:28.391
probably couldn't have happened really at a worse 
time during the deep part of the Depression.

03:31.395 --> 03:37.302
What was your father's occupation?

03:38.523 --> 03:41.827
As far back as I could remember, he was in the 
electrical business. At this particular time, he

03:42.167 --> 03:51.458
was working for David Wilson, an electrical 
contractor there in town. After we came back from

03:52.079 --> 03:57.787
Wisconsin and Waco, he went into business for 
himself. I see. And could you give us your dad's

03:59.830 --> 04:01.973
name? My dad was Tuxton Burrell Truax. Remember 
where he grew up? He grew up primarily out at

04:06.779 --> 04:12.627
Novice, which is about 15, 18 miles west of 
Coleman. And your mother, can you remember her

04:13.709 --> 04:19.336
name and where she grew up? My mother was... Ada 
Buckmaster, she grew up primarily in Wisconsin.

04:30.383 --> 04:33.928
She and dad met in New Mexico, where she was 
teaching school. But her father was a doctor and

04:34.809 --> 04:47.585
one time was head of the state and St. Asylum 
institution there in Wisconsin. I take it then

04:49.187 --> 04:51.870
your mother was fairly uneducated when Yes, she 
was. It's a little interesting that their 50th

04:53.401 --> 05:10.847
wedding anniversary, I met a man who, in New 
Mexico, she had had as a pupil, that they had just by

04:53.401 --> 05:10.847
accident run in there. He heard the clerk mention 
the name Truax in the grocery store. And this was,

05:16.355 --> 05:21.182
he remembered. my mother and renewed an 
acquaintance.

05:28.485 --> 05:29.506
Did your mother go to college? She did? I'm sure she 
did, but I'm really not this sure where. At

05:35.472 --> 05:38.274
Janesville, I think, but I'm not this positive.

05:41.557 --> 05:44.580
Well, when did you graduate from high school? I 
graduated from Donna High School in 1940.

05:49.613 --> 05:51.995
Do you remember anything about the high school 
there? The size? I believe, if I remember right,

05:53.937 --> 06:05.428
there were 320 in high school, and I believe there 
were 39 or 40 in our graduating class. Do you

06:07.530 --> 06:14.697
remember anything about your high school 
experiences, anything that comes to mind at that

06:07.530 --> 06:14.697
time? It might give some bearing on the education 
at that time. No, not really. We had

06:21.664 --> 06:36.162
just primarily one teacher to a subject type 
thing, and there was one or two of them.

06:39.246 --> 06:49.658
They'd always done real well in math in high 
school, and when I got to A&M, why, I decided that it

06:39.246 --> 06:49.658
was only because it had been so easy. And where 
chemistry, at that time at least, was considered

06:50.212 --> 07:03.624
kind of a bust-out course, I made B's in it because 
of a good foundation from a good instructor. You

07:03.704 --> 07:09.168
felt you were fairly well prepared then to enter 
college, then, from your grades? Yes, I was

07:09.449 --> 07:15.834
probably third or fourth in our high school class. 
As a freshman, I had the highest grades in the

07:21.346 --> 07:23.028
class. How did you wind up going to A&M? What 
motivated you to go there? I think primarily my

07:30.515 --> 07:34.920
father. I can't ever really recall him ever 
talking specifically about it, except that

07:35.460 --> 07:48.754
somewhere or another he had me convinced I wanted 
to go to college. I grew up working with him even

07:49.477 --> 07:59.227
before he went into business for himself, 
weekends and such as this. He was always one of

07:59.708 --> 08:09.578
great patience and would answer any kind of 
questions or what have you. And

08:11.119 --> 08:19.348
like I say, he had not even finished Well, I'm not 
sure how far he got, but I know he didn't finish high

08:20.358 --> 08:28.130
school, and I'm not sure he ever got to high school. 
And this was one of the things that he made

08:29.592 --> 08:47.800
every effort to convince me that I wanted to

08:29.592 --> 08:47.800
in a roundabout way, not pressuring you or the way 
that you would rebel and not want to go. I can

08:50.928 --> 09:01.458
remember writing themes in Spanish about wanting 
to go to A&M, major in engineering, and go to South

08:50.928 --> 09:01.458
America. Traveling

09:01.498 --> 09:09.666
in the service took the South America desire out 
some. However, I always liked traveling.

09:18.931 --> 09:21.034
What were your first impressions? First of all, 
when did you arrive at A&M, and what were your first

09:21.494 --> 09:27.342
impressions? Well, this is, I'm sure, in one 
sense, some different.

09:34.351 --> 09:47.908
Boy, at one time, my dad went to a short course with 
an Alton Bird, who lived there in Donner still, but

09:34.351 --> 09:47.908
long years ago, before I can remember, they were in 
an auto shop business together. And we went to,

09:52.735 --> 09:56.539
they went to a short course, and I went up there with 
them. And their son was, Mr. Bird's son was in

09:56.559 --> 10:02.745
college at that time. And immediately after I 
graduated from high school, that week following,

10:04.147 --> 10:18.402
I hitchhiked up there and spent a week with George 
Bird just before his graduation. In a sense, this

10:18.736 --> 10:48.152
was,

10:18.736 --> 10:48.152
well, it didn't have any real repercussions in 
that Burt Campbell, who was orderly for George as a

10:18.736 --> 10:48.152
freshman and George a senior,

10:18.736 --> 10:48.152
made up my bed, took me to breakfast meals and this 
sort of thing, When then in the following year I'm

10:49.145 --> 10:57.195
in the same company with Burt Campbell as a 
sophomore and me as an incoming freshman. I see.

10:59.358 --> 11:02.342
And when did, what did you start in the fall of 1940? 
In the fall of 1940. I see. I entered. What company?

11:08.110 --> 11:09.591
In headquarters signal company. And what was your 
major at this point? Electrical engineering.

11:14.558 --> 11:15.359
Electrical engineering. What do you remember 
from your freshman year? Was it particularly hard

11:18.271 --> 11:20.234
on you? Was the hazing severe?

11:26.362 --> 11:46.050
I'd always looked at the hazing a little different 
I guess than than lots in the they

11:26.362 --> 11:46.050
it appeared a good deal to me as far as you taking 
care of an upperclassman's room for a year and you

11:26.362 --> 11:46.050
get your room taken care of for three years and It 
seems like a good trade. Yeah, this is...

11:54.059 --> 12:05.232
I got caught eating cake when you shouldn't have 
and drank the castor oil and ate spinach. And, of

12:05.312 --> 12:16.324
course, I can remember trying to haze me drinking 
buttermilk, but I like buttermilk and I like

12:05.312 --> 12:16.324
spinach, so lots of these things didn't bother me 
like some of them. The chew in the back, I got sick.

12:25.732 --> 12:28.536
The hazing though was not particularly physical 
at this time. No, it was very physical much of the

12:28.876 --> 12:32.302
time. Of

12:32.322 --> 12:42.497
course the sophomores, were running it. The one 
thing that to me broke down later, and I often

12:46.089 --> 13:07.334
wondered if this is when they started going 
straight through and it wasn't that period

12:46.089 --> 13:07.334
between the end of your sophomore year and the 
beginning of the junior year and this, that they

12:46.089 --> 13:07.334
didn't want to quit. But as a freshman,

13:12.937 --> 13:18.545
In our company, at least, it was very resonant.

13:21.049 --> 13:25.636
Specifically, a senior could call for a freshman, 
and all freshmen could come running. A junior

13:26.878 --> 13:33.167
could call fish so-and-so, and that freshman 
would come running. A sophomore had to go get him a

13:33.187 --> 13:39.737
freshman if he wanted a detailed run.

13:42.164 --> 13:52.159
One of the worst things you could do would be not to 
speak to and or go meet friends of a senior. He

13:53.681 --> 14:01.573
didn't ever say anything to you, but he got him a 
junior and that junior got in several sophomores

13:53.681 --> 14:01.573
and the sophomores got all were freshmen. So that 
it was a strict type of chain of command, so to

14:02.835 --> 14:11.428
speak. Do you feel later why this seemed to break 
down and the juniors and seniors were hazing just

14:13.720 --> 14:24.814
as much as the sophomores were? Do you feel that the 
seniors or juniors kept the hazing in line? Did the

14:32.183 --> 14:34.385
sophomores do most of the physical hazing? Yes, 
the sophomores primarily did. Well, before the

14:39.674 --> 14:47.304
first football game, the company commander 
announced there would be a company meeting at the

14:39.674 --> 14:47.304
second floor in the hall there. With it, they lined 
up with boards, and the juniors went through, and

14:49.467 --> 14:57.437
the sophomores went through, and the freshmen 
went through, and they went on to football games.

14:58.339 --> 15:06.289
And then juniors lined up, and sophomores went 
through, and the freshmen went through, and they

14:58.339 --> 15:06.289
went on, and then the sophomores lined up. But 
primarily, the

15:08.986 --> 15:20.746
seniors and the juniors were the ones who 
controlled it, but they didn't do the hazing. And I

15:21.727 --> 15:24.111
say they didn't do the hazing. Some freshmen got 
real out of line. A senior would collar in a couple

15:27.497 --> 15:34.909
of juniors, and those juniors in turn that same 
chain of command to the sophomores. And the

15:38.317 --> 15:42.741
sophomores would have the whole freshman class in 
our company there. Keep in mind, though, that they

15:45.304 --> 15:50.348
did have some, in a sense, reverse outlets. 
Halloween night, the juniors came around and got

15:51.089 --> 15:54.592
the freshmen. And we out and dug a mud hole. And 
sophomores were free game then in our class. And

16:01.499 --> 16:04.862
they were hauled out and dumped the mud hole and it 
was it was not gentle to say the least they could

16:05.804 --> 16:35.676
fight and look there were always more freshmen 
than there were same way we'd have

16:05.804 --> 16:35.676
semi-controlled i guess you would say tackle 
football games with just towels for padding and

16:05.804 --> 16:35.676
that's all so that you did have some in a sense uh 
semi-legal opportunities to vent your anger at

16:36.432 --> 16:46.706
the sophomores, and yet the system still worked. 
Do you feel like you learned anything from this

16:47.907 --> 16:54.997
particular

16:47.907 --> 16:54.997
discipline, shall we call it? Do you feel like 
there was anything to be learned from this, that

16:55.017 --> 16:58.281
there was a point to it?

17:02.247 --> 17:04.009
I always felt that this was was one part of that that

17:05.474 --> 17:17.754
made you closer as a unit through your years there. 
Because almost, except

17:19.276 --> 17:32.578
for rare exceptions, and we had a couple who

17:19.276 --> 17:32.578
just delighted in hazing, I guess you'd say. But 
primarily, it was the chain of command type thing

17:33.605 --> 17:39.450
and not just indiscriminately. Hazing for 
hazing. Right. Now, I'm not sure that this is true

17:42.753 --> 17:46.036
on the whole campus by any means. I think that there 
are some of the other places where

17:46.516 --> 17:57.406
maybe it was a difference in the group. All of them, 
of course, in the Signal Corps at least started

17:57.546 --> 18:02.110
out. signed up for EE. They didn't all necessarily 
stay there all the way through, but this was the way

18:03.926 --> 18:11.015
you ended up in the Signal Corps to begin with. I 
see. Do you feel that maybe this taught you

18:12.877 --> 18:15.921
self-discipline in a way? Could it teach you to 
discipline yourself as far as having to follow

18:15.961 --> 18:20.006
certain rules and regulations? There were places 
you were supposed to be at certain times and things

18:20.046 --> 18:25.432
you did at certain times and things you did not do. 
Do you feel this way? I felt very definitely that it

18:26.474 --> 18:28.676
did. And it also The hazing bit

18:32.161 --> 18:55.202
was controlled, the study, and this is one of the 
places some of the stories you heard make you think

18:32.161 --> 18:55.202
then that it wasn't as controlled as some of the 
other units. Seven o'clock, call the quarters,

18:55.622 --> 19:02.168
you got at your desk and you stayed at your desk even 
if you had to prop your head up until 11 o'clock. The

19:06.028 --> 19:12.875
only place you could go would be to the restroom and 
back to your room, and that was it. You didn't go

19:13.415 --> 19:16.799
visit any other freshmen anywhere. You stayed in 
your room and were supposed to study. There was no

19:20.882 --> 19:30.872
time that any of the upperclassmen interfered 
with this study time, sending you on details or

19:20.882 --> 19:30.872
anything else. I gathered that this, as I said, 
didn't necessarily hold true to all the other

19:32.033 --> 19:38.903
units. Do you think this taught you how to study? 
How to discipline your time? Not really, but it was

19:43.990 --> 19:50.939
if you went ahead and used it, why it helped. And 
there was at 11 o'clock you went to bed, however

20:01.396 --> 20:09.224
I don't know if there was a specific time, but I've 
been up as early as 3 o'clock working on a drawing or

20:01.396 --> 20:09.224
something like this. And there never seemed to be a 
limit at what time you could get back up again. But

20:14.309 --> 20:16.631
you did go to bed at 11 o'clock and lights out. I see. 
Do you remember anything else about your freshman

20:19.033 --> 20:20.775
year? Any of the courses that were particularly 
hard? Well, primarily, of course, I did standard

20:25.740 --> 20:31.065
engineering, freshman engineering. 
curriculum.

20:36.051 --> 20:49.122
Trig, as I mentioned before, after I got up there, 
I'm not that sure of my math background since I

20:36.051 --> 20:49.122
don't remember ever having heard of Trig before I 
went to college.

20:55.187 --> 21:01.272
And the math, I guess, primarily was where I had my 
hardest time as a sophomore year busting

21:01.657 --> 21:30.550
the first semester I guess the second semester 
first semester of calculus is the only course I

21:01.657 --> 21:30.550
ever busted but did you lose a lot of people that 
first year out of your freshman class a lot as I

21:01.657 --> 21:30.550
don't remember exactly how many we started with in 
the company but there were somewhere 28 or 30

21:01.657 --> 21:30.550
would be my recollection and as I recall we end up 
with something like 12 and this included the end of

21:31.205 --> 21:44.705
our freshman year included a couple of frogs 
midterm transfers.

21:48.791 --> 21:56.622
As you went along are there any particular 
professors that you have that you remember that

21:48.791 --> 21:56.622
you think might have helped you or been 
inspirational? who maybe took particular pains

21:57.580 --> 22:03.747
with you, or any that you had a close relationship 
that you recall? I would think in the EE

22:06.310 --> 22:27.115
department, of course,

22:06.310 --> 22:27.115
LL Four Acre was probably one that,

22:06.310 --> 22:27.115
don't know if it's necessarily inspiration, but 
more understanding of some of your problems and

22:06.310 --> 22:27.115
this and than any I had, and I had him, I guess, as 
sophomore and junior on some courses. You, in the

22:36.698 --> 22:47.127
department at that time, of course, Rhodey was one 
who was, always amazed you.

22:51.030 --> 22:56.595
He could ride around the room about three times 
during a one-hour class. Let's get back a little

22:58.938 --> 23:01.360
bit. Do you remember any impressions about the 
campus when you got there? What you felt about the

23:05.143 --> 23:09.968
whole physical nature of it? Was it over, was it 
friendly?

23:14.992 --> 23:17.775
Or was it a stark sort of place? No, it was, of 
course, we lived in, at that time, the new dorms,

23:18.195 --> 23:27.443
the 1 to 12.

23:29.279 --> 23:40.476
I'd always thought

23:29.279 --> 23:40.476
that the campus was well landscaped and they 
changed it with the seasons.

23:43.801 --> 23:54.578
It was always to me a

23:43.801 --> 23:54.578
thrill, so to speak, hitchhiking back and come in 
the East Gate, it was a long ways back up to the norm

23:55.638 --> 24:06.152
area, but even so, it was a sense of being home, so to 
speak. You mentioned hitchhiking. Did most of the

24:08.075 --> 24:10.118
students hitchhike? There were a tremendous 
number, I would say, hitchhiked.

24:19.230 --> 24:25.138
As I recall, there wasn't anybody in our company 
had a car on the campus. when I was a freshman, and I

24:25.726 --> 24:29.070
could be mistaken about some of the... Were you 
allowed cars if you had one at this time? There were

24:33.415 --> 24:36.838
a few cars on the campus. Whether this was because 
of a disability or what, this was never my worry

24:36.979 --> 24:46.449
since it was all I could do to stay there. How did you 
finance your education? Did your father help you?

24:50.234 --> 24:51.135
Did you work any? Primarily my father. I mean, I 
worked for him all the time at no wages, so to speak,

24:54.835 --> 25:08.179
and

24:54.835 --> 25:08.179
this part of it. Oh, at one time I did wait tables 
some in the mess hall. Steve, was this before or

25:14.530 --> 25:17.555
after the war? We'll get to the war in a minute. I 
believe this was probably after the war had

25:21.329 --> 25:27.215
started, but before I'd gone on active duty. Okay, 
we'll get to that in a minute. Is there anything

25:30.778 --> 25:36.183
else you remember about these pre-war days at A&M? 
Oh, we were talking about the discipline, the

25:36.203 --> 25:41.308
regimentation, so to speak.

25:46.513 --> 25:50.897
Obviously, it all agreed with me since when I 
started as a Freshman, I weighed 130 pounds, and at

25:51.181 --> 25:55.547
Easter, I weighed 168. How was the food? 
Excellent. It was very good. Yes. You got enough to

26:01.614 --> 26:02.535
eat? No question about it. It was family style. 
Were you eating a Dunkin' at this time? A Dunkin'.

26:12.288 --> 26:13.549
Mm-hmm. As a freshman, did you have any trouble 
eating? Did they give you any harassment about...

26:20.037 --> 26:30.613
No, as I said a while ago, sometimes they would feel 
like they were hazing you to make you eat spinach or

26:20.037 --> 26:30.613
make you drink buttermilk or some of these things. 
That's no problem. Some, right, this was, I

26:33.117 --> 26:48.120
got my fill of turnip greens one time and it took 
years to ever eat them again, but other than that, I

26:33.117 --> 26:48.120
know Did they ever stop you from eating certain 
things? Did they say, you know, y'all can't have

26:51.661 --> 26:53.925
this tonight? Only dessert, and this was, of 
course, we used to get out every morning, 6 o'clock

26:55.086 --> 27:06.503
or whenever it was, so many days left till Kush, 
eating dessert. And anybody asked and gave the

27:08.125 --> 27:18.360
wrong day while you started all over, so we almost, 
I don't recall that we ever worked down to where

27:19.538 --> 27:20.439
This was legal. So this went on pretty much your 
entire freshman year? Yes. But it didn't hurt you

27:24.643 --> 27:25.704
any? No, not. They weren't depriving you of enough 
food to keep you alive. You

27:31.670 --> 27:37.376
were there when war was declared in December of 
1941. Can you remember the mood of the campus when

27:37.496 --> 27:45.664
war was declared, the feeling?

27:52.816 --> 28:05.413
Well, I recall that Sunday afternoon, 
specifically, everybody in a sense kind of hushed

27:52.816 --> 28:05.413
homes and

27:52.816 --> 28:05.413
shocked and amazed. There was a feeling of 
disbelief then? Well, in a sense, yes. However,

28:12.783 --> 28:20.173
they had already started this where you belong to 
the enlisted reserve before you could

28:21.419 --> 28:26.567
participate in advanced ROTC and this sort of 
thing. As I recall, I

28:28.130 --> 28:46.178
had gotten my papers because this was, of course, 
then in my sophomore year and you were to do this

28:28.130 --> 28:46.178
before

28:49.111 --> 28:56.782
at the end of the school term so you would be ready 
the following year for consideration of advanced

28:49.111 --> 28:56.782
ROTC. I see. Was it advanced ROTC at this time, was 
it difficult to get into? Were they very

29:03.991 --> 29:05.554
selective? No. As I recall, most who wanted it got 
in. It may not have been quite that easy, I'm not

29:10.861 --> 29:14.646
real sure. Now, war was declared when you were a 
sophomore at this time. Probably toward the end of

29:20.156 --> 29:21.558
the semester. Well, toward the end of the first 
semester of the sophomore year. Now, what

29:26.786 --> 29:29.529
happened after war was declared? What went on on 
the campus? Do you remember what preparations

29:32.073 --> 29:37.701
were made, gearing up for wartime activities? The 
only big change that I can recall at this

29:39.043 --> 29:44.751
particular time was change in the ROTC 
instructors took place more rapidly. And as I

29:51.485 --> 30:02.195
recall, they

29:51.485 --> 30:02.195
were thinned down to a certain extent also.

30:05.558 --> 30:08.901
But this took place over a period of time. As a 
freshman and sophomore, we had A man who was a staff

30:15.747 --> 30:32.333
sergeant who received a direct commission, and as 
a captain, and with his longevity and kids,

30:15.747 --> 30:32.333
was about the second highest paid military 
personnel on the campus. How long did it take him to

30:34.516 --> 30:36.900
get rolling? Did the second semester go smoothly, 
or did they interrupt you at any time during the

30:37.060 --> 30:42.649
second semester?

30:45.160 --> 30:48.525
No, I recall no interruptions. So you went on 
through your sophomore year? I went through and

30:50.027 --> 30:56.276
finished my sophomore year, and actually this is 
when then they started going straight through

30:50.027 --> 30:56.276
three semesters a year. And my finances being what 
they were, I laid out and worked that summer here in

30:57.678 --> 31:08.674
Corpus Christi and went back in the fall. And on 
this basis then, you didn't start. advanced ROTC

31:13.595 --> 31:26.606
at mid-turn, so I was actually then in December or 
approximately before I rejoined an ROTC unit. I

31:27.787 --> 31:33.131
lived in

31:27.787 --> 31:33.131
Goodwin Hall, I guess it was. As a civilian 
student? Yes. Did you have to wear a uniform? We

31:37.935 --> 31:43.500
still wore a uniform, but we were not in the Corps as 
such. So you were getting ahead academically

31:44.885 --> 31:48.150
ahead of your military then? Right. So then in the 
mid- then what was not mid-semester, when did you

31:49.572 --> 31:54.939
rejoin a unit now? Well actually it would be the 
beginning of my academic senior year, but it

31:56.361 --> 32:04.953
turned out it was my junior year. And then it was in 
this semester when we all went on active duty,

32:12.826 --> 32:20.135
all those who were in advanced ROTC. The units all 
left the campus for approximately a week, as I

32:21.157 --> 32:27.485
recall. Do you remember when this was? 
Approximately what day was it? March. March of 43.

32:37.718 --> 32:39.660
As mentioned before, you To be an advanced ROTC, 
you had to be an enlisted reserve, and this was a

32:41.058 --> 32:47.526
matter of calling up the enlisted reserve. I see. 
From A&M,

32:49.910 --> 32:57.800
units went various places.

33:00.564 --> 33:04.449
In the Signal Corps, we went to Camp Beauregard, 
Louisiana. There were those who went to Camp

33:04.549 --> 33:07.032
Walters. those went to Fort Sam Houston. These 
were all induction centers.

33:15.855 --> 33:17.276
Where did you go? I went to Beauregard, Louisiana. 
For how long? It took about a week. We went through

33:22.643 --> 33:34.977
the standard battery of tests and were issued in 
uniforms and taken down to Camp Livingston for

33:22.643 --> 33:34.977
inoculations, and then put on a train back to the 
campus and we finished our regular semester. Were

33:40.285 --> 33:42.068
you on active duty and being paid? Yes. The whole 
time? Just after we were called active duty. And

33:46.494 --> 33:49.938
what rank did they consider you all as? As a 
private. As a private, and they were paying you all

33:50.619 --> 33:52.642
as private? Right. I see. Okay, after you came back 
to the campus, you went ahead and finished that

33:54.825 --> 33:57.989
semester? We finished our regular classes that 
semester and immediately after at the end of the

34:04.572 --> 34:09.219
term scattered to the winds again. Those, and here 
again I'm talking now not class of 44, because I, in

34:09.280 --> 34:27.208
this ROTC business, I was really with the class of 
45, having missed a year of ROTC. But all of these in

34:28.531 --> 34:32.537
this class went to various training camps for 
basic training before going to OCS. Those who were

34:41.301 --> 34:51.297
actually in the class of 44 went directly, and I say 
directly, almost directly to OCS, I believe.

34:53.921 --> 34:55.403
What camp did you go to? There was a train load of us. 
We first went to Fort Sam, and then from there on a

34:58.791 --> 35:04.379
train to Camp Roberts, California. As the story 
goes, I wasn't there, but supposedly some of them

35:05.501 --> 35:16.898
working in the supply room, the colonel came in and 
said, boy, there's been a mistake made. All of

35:16.918 --> 35:19.101
y'all are not supposed to have been here. Those of 
us there at the time were cavalry, Coast Guard

35:20.042 --> 35:25.390
cavalry, no, no field artillery. Calvary, Coast 
Artillery, Engineers, Signal Corps, and

35:25.640 --> 35:29.844
Infantry. And almost immediately, those of us 
that had been in Signal Corps over D.C. went to Camp

35:31.526 --> 35:39.873
Kohler close to Sacramento. The Coast Artillery 
went to Camp McQuaid, and the Engineers went on up

35:41.495 --> 35:49.382
to Camp Abbott in Oregon. And this was basic 
training? This was basic training. and was

35:54.226 --> 36:10.667
probably some of the best military

35:54.226 --> 36:10.667
training I ever had, and the company commander got 
out, y'all are ROTC, you're supposed to be able to

35:54.226 --> 36:10.667
know how to march, let's see. We marched, and he 
said, there's no sense in spending time on that,

36:11.669 --> 36:16.134
we'll go to something else. Fortunately, we went 
to Camp Kohler, they had a, training program set

36:22.643 --> 36:28.250
up, and we were doing things that we had done the 
first six weeks. We were in freshman ROTC. Did they

36:31.934 --> 36:33.376
keep the A&M people together? We stayed together, 
yes. You didn't have any people coming in from the

36:36.519 --> 36:38.522
outside? We had a few, and really you feel sorry for 
them because they were behind. Some of them,

36:45.870 --> 36:47.252
right. We had one or two draftees there at at Camp 
Roberts that were in a unit with, well, it was a

36:50.707 --> 36:59.560
whole battalion, training battalion, full of 
nothing but Aggies.

37:01.964 --> 37:06.050
So there was no way that they could do it. And 
eventually, as I recall, they got them

37:06.110 --> 37:09.475
transferred out.

37:13.461 --> 37:14.723
How long were you in basic training?

37:19.748 --> 37:22.852
Until September, I believe it was, October.

37:25.295 --> 37:30.301
It was supposedly the pretty much standard basic 
training. Do you remember how many weeks?

37:36.229 --> 37:37.250
Not for positive. It was about the middle of July 
when we went to Camp Kohler after having been there

37:37.370 --> 37:48.945
at Camp Roberts for about six weeks. I see.

37:55.021 --> 38:01.109
Somewhere about the first of October, we were 
assigned to an ASTP unit. We were sent back to A&M to

38:01.129 --> 38:06.397
be in the ASTP. What's an ASTP unit? Army Student 
Training Unit Program. Okay. You were sent back to

38:12.846 --> 38:14.528
the State College? Still as a group.

38:18.507 --> 38:26.596
I was presumed primarily because there wasn't an 
opening in OCS because after one semester of this

38:18.507 --> 38:26.596
we did go on to OCS. Now wait a minute, so you were 
back at A&M for another full semester then? For,

38:33.784 --> 38:46.658
right, it was a speeded up and these were, we ended 
up getting some hours credit just as a

38:48.899 --> 38:57.788
transcript shows full military referral ROTC 
credit by having gotten a commission. These hours

38:57.808 --> 39:02.473
were added to just as if you'd taken them there at 
A&M. Now, wait a minute. You're talking about

39:04.636 --> 39:06.177
getting a commission. After basic training, you 
still were not commissioned, were you? No. No. We

39:10.122 --> 39:11.903
went to the STP unit. Then from there, we went to 
Fort Monmouth, New Jersey to Signal Corps. Do you

39:18.447 --> 39:20.229
remember when this was? We went in February, right 
towards the end of February, and this was quite a

39:20.249 --> 39:27.496
change weather-wise. And it still has a unit to 
OCS? All of us in the Signal Corps, yes. The other

39:36.166 --> 39:41.271
units were going various directions, and I'm not 
positive that all of them came back. A number of the

39:42.092 --> 39:46.176
various different ones did come back.

39:49.345 --> 39:56.672
But I can't be positive about all of them coming to 
ASTP before they went to OCS. I know the group that I

39:57.733 --> 40:00.776
was with in the Signal Corps did. So you were at OCS 
for how long? I got out of OCS in June. Now your A&M

40:13.248 --> 40:17.412
training and all the other military training, did 
you have any trouble with OCS? No, not

40:19.096 --> 40:20.417
particularly. Were all the people here, your OCS 
training unit, were they A&M people? No, all of

40:28.567 --> 40:37.176
those of us in the ROTC were in this class, but there 
were some other classes.

40:40.800 --> 40:45.205
I don't remember ever seeing Mr. Foraker 
afterwards this. but one experience that I recall

40:45.556 --> 40:58.730
well was there was a group from Clemson, and they 
were talking about one of their prof and imitating

40:45.556 --> 40:58.730
him, and they said, well, that sounds like Four 
Acre. Well, it is Four Acre. It was my

41:01.853 --> 41:13.446
understanding that it was Four Acre's either twin 
brother or brother, but there were these from

41:01.853 --> 41:13.446
Clemson. There were a few from

41:15.492 --> 41:32.551
regular Army enlisted personnel that were there 
at OCS class, but primarily it was the two largest

41:15.492 --> 41:32.551
groups in our class, I think, were Clemson ROTC and 
A&M ROTC units. How did A&M ROTC units at this time

41:32.571 --> 41:36.715
stack up against the other schools? I think we did 
probably pretty close to equally well. We had I had

41:45.327 --> 41:48.192
two pretty close friends that busted out. The big 
problem primarily was barracks inspection while

41:48.232 --> 42:08.348
you were at class and having the closing button or 
some such thing as this and even work

41:48.232 --> 42:08.348
out trying to help and check them and that kind of 
thing and you'd get down for formation to go to

42:09.307 --> 42:23.382
class and they'd forgotten something and run back 
up and mess up something in their hurry and this

42:09.307 --> 42:23.382
sort of thing. The A&M people pretty much stick 
together over this then? Yes. Try to help one

42:26.966 --> 42:28.889
another through. Yes. So you got out of OCS in June? 
I believe this is right in June. Then you were

42:36.003 --> 42:38.827
commissioned at that point? At that point, 
commissioned, yes. Then what? I went to officer

42:43.232 --> 42:47.698
school for about six weeks. It was called Long 
Lines Inside, which is telephone equipment,

42:48.820 --> 43:03.499
switchboards, teletype, repeaters, this sort of 
equipment, and then was assigned to a unit. This

43:03.519 --> 43:05.301
was also at Fort Monmouth. and then was assigned to 
a casual detachment group that

43:06.935 --> 43:24.598
went overseas with—Signal

43:06.935 --> 43:24.598
Corps had what they called teams in this group that 
went over. There were ten radio teams and five

43:24.658 --> 43:30.445
switchboard teams.

43:34.778 --> 43:38.764
Okay, let me stop just for a second here and turn my 
tape over.
