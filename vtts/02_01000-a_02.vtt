WEBVTT

00:06.410 --> 00:17.923
A lot of times you drop your ruck in first and then 
you come down on top of it rather than have it on your

00:06.410 --> 00:17.923
back because of the extra weight and stuff like 
that. But we normally in our missions we carry what

00:18.323 --> 00:32.819
they call just like the fights where you go with 
just a shoulder harness type thing with a couple of

00:18.323 --> 00:32.819
canteens and a couple of rounds of ammunition, 
cases of ammunition and stuff. So we really didn't

00:32.839 --> 00:34.881
carry that much. I walked point quite often in the 
jungle area where it was very dense in the

00:34.962 --> 00:41.091
mountains and stuff especially. I walked point 
with a 12-gauge shotgun. Most of the time I carried

00:44.616 --> 00:56.634
an M16, but in cases where it was real dense jungle 
where we were actually cutting our way through

00:44.616 --> 00:56.634
with machetes and stuff, you'd walk point with 
something that would kill in a short area. At one

00:57.335 --> 01:01.982
time I carried a grease gun, which was an automatic 
.45 caliber gun. thing which only is only deadly at

01:02.485 --> 01:28.543
about 50 yards or less you know it doesn't have a 
very long distance on it i always carried a 45

01:02.485 --> 01:28.543
caliber pistol you know standard service issue 
pistol uh most of the time carried the m16 but it

01:02.485 --> 01:28.543
just depended on the situation i carried m60 a 
little bit i was a little bit small for carrying it

01:02.485 --> 01:28.543
but i carried it a few times when when you walked 
point did you um Did you ever carry your rucksack?

01:31.512 --> 01:33.174
Yeah. No matter where you were, you carried your 
stuff. Do you ever felt like that was ineffective

01:35.856 --> 01:40.320
and bundled you down? Did you learn how to work with 
that? You learned you had to carry what you had.

01:45.725 --> 01:48.127
Nobody would carry your food for you or your water. 
If you wanted food and water, you carried it

01:48.547 --> 01:50.449
yourself. Some guys lived on less than others. At 
times, after I really got orientated in the

01:53.431 --> 01:58.716
country, we would actually go up to rivers or blue 
lines we call them and throw a hand grenade in the

01:59.253 --> 02:26.003
river and kill fish and we actually eat fish or rice 
like the locals and therefore we wouldn't be

01:59.253 --> 02:26.003
smelling any different from what the Vietnamese 
would smell you know any kind of odor anything

01:59.253 --> 02:26.003
given off is from cooking if we were cooking you 
know our sea rations or something you know you

01:59.253 --> 02:26.003
could smell that and it was definitely a different 
odor so a lot of times if we knew we were going to be an

01:59.253 --> 02:26.003
area where we could get fish or something like that 
we would not take as much sea rations. So from that

02:28.395 --> 02:32.260
standpoint we didn't have to carry near as much 
stuff. When I got to the first calve we ate mostly

02:33.281 --> 02:50.540
lerps there which is a long-range patrol which is a 
dried food where all you had to do is add water to it

02:33.281 --> 02:50.540
and you could heat your water and put it in there or 
just do it cold. So really in those lerps you could

02:50.560 --> 02:53.543
carry A lot of LURPs and almost no weight at all 
because it was a freeze-dried food, so there was no

02:53.860 --> 02:59.431
weight to it whatsoever. But those were mainly for 
the special mission type stuff. Your normal

03:05.723 --> 03:09.591
infantry units didn't get those. They had to carry 
their normal cans of C-rations and stuff like

03:09.651 --> 03:13.118
that. So it was an extra weight type deal. But, you 
know, it just depended on the mission and the

03:15.004 --> 03:18.730
length of time. Sometimes after a couple of weeks 
out in the field, they'd drop us a new set of

03:18.790 --> 03:29.605
clothes, and, you know, we'd get different 
changes of, you know, stuff, boots or socks or

03:18.790 --> 03:29.605
whatever, you know, that way. Did the new set of 
clothes have a detergent smell to them? Oh, they

03:34.352 --> 03:35.213
weren't new. They were just... They were clean, I 
guess. Let me put it that way. They drop a bundle of

03:41.480 --> 03:45.105
clothes, and you dig out something that might fit 
you, and you put it on. But it was clean clothes.

03:46.807 --> 03:52.896
After two or three weeks without bathing, you 
start smelling real bad, and your socks stand up by

03:46.807 --> 03:52.896
themselves and stuff like that. But there again, 
you get used to it, and it really doesn't affect you

03:53.757 --> 03:57.442
a whole lot. That was something that a lot of guys 
accepted that a lot easier than others, but it's

03:57.462 --> 04:05.633
something you just have to accept and realize you 
can go now. There were some areas we could bathe in

04:05.849 --> 04:14.979
the streams and rivers and try to keep clean, but, 
you know, you just go and go and go, and, you know,

04:05.849 --> 04:14.979
you don't really worry about your personal 
hygiene. You worry about staying alive. Did the

04:16.240 --> 04:27.292
company, somebody in the company ever carry a 
motor or any, what kind of other weapons did you

04:16.240 --> 04:27.292
carry other than personal weapons? Well, they 
carried, like I was saying earlier, a lot of people

04:27.312 --> 04:31.076
carried the laws. They carried 20-millimeter 
guns. grenade launcher type things. The M60

04:36.883 --> 04:40.387
machine gun, every squad had an M60 guy. Some guys 
carried other type of hand things, but probably

04:42.549 --> 04:50.298
the M60 was the biggest, you know, probably did the 
most damage type thing. You know, they carried

04:50.318 --> 05:03.312
rounds and rounds of that, and usually the ammo 
from that, you'd either carry it in a hand metal

04:50.318 --> 05:03.312
canister, or they would hook it together and cross 
it across your chest, just like a You know, you see

05:03.663 --> 05:08.750
your banditos or whatever carry their, you know, 
strings of ammo. And usually carrying on your

05:09.290 --> 05:13.175
chest was easier because you had your hands free. 
And if you had to hand carry a pouch of ammo, you

05:13.956 --> 05:19.984
know, your hand was always taken up with something 
in your hand. So they'd take it out of there and

05:20.385 --> 05:23.469
crisscross across their chest and hook it on. Then 
all they had to do was unsnap it, lay it in there, and

05:23.749 --> 05:26.052
go. You know, it was real easy to feed in and go that 
way. Normally, there was not very many. If we were

05:32.491 --> 05:37.816
going out and definitely setting up a sniper type 
thing with a starlight scope, we might carry an M14

05:32.491 --> 05:37.816
or two. And they were a lot more accurate as a sniper 
rifle. And had scopes on everything on them. Those

05:44.142 --> 05:45.524
were strictly sniper rifles. Were they night 
scopes? Starlight scope, night scope, yeah. We

05:49.387 --> 05:50.569
had those available to us. They were really, 
really nice. But that would really be the biggest

05:52.390 --> 05:53.792
thing. Of course, the .50 cals, if we were ever 
moving in a convoy on the roads and stuff, the Jeeps

05:53.812 --> 05:59.978
all had .50 cals on them. You know, some of the 
choppers had .50 cals mounted in them as door guns.

06:05.341 --> 06:07.884
Most of them had M60s, but some of them had .50 cals. 
The Chinooks had .50 cals in them. And, of course,

06:10.768 --> 06:17.457
your choppers and stuff, a lot of those had the 
20-millimeter cannons and rockets and, you know,

06:10.768 --> 06:17.457
the machine guns and stuff set up in those. But as 
far as our actual personal weaponry, it was mostly

06:17.517 --> 06:24.126
just handguns as all we, you know, just light 
weapons that we carried ourselves. What

06:26.348 --> 06:28.311
equipment was most effective? for whatever 
purpose it served in, what equipment did y'all

06:28.763 --> 06:35.694
have to carry that was completely ineffective? 
Was there any? Was it allowable to ditch what you

06:38.017 --> 06:43.666
knew would not be effective? We pretty much could 
pick what we wanted to carry. Okay. And, I mean, you

06:49.194 --> 06:53.240
know, we all wanted to carry frags or hand 
grenades. Most of us had to carry at least two

06:54.422 --> 06:56.425
smokes. And this would be for different reasons. 
We almost all had to carry at least one tear gas

06:59.977 --> 07:02.839
grenade. What did you use tear gas for? Normally 
put it down the caves or bunker complexes,

07:05.361 --> 07:11.707
whatever you want to call them. We'd go into a 
bunker complex and pop gas and put it in there. Most

07:17.031 --> 07:19.673
of us did not carry gas masks. It wasn't prominent 
or necessary. They were issued to you, but usually

07:22.976 --> 07:26.479
you lost them real fast and didn't carry them. We 
did, some guys carried them more than others, you

07:26.864 --> 07:32.472
know, it depends on where you were in the area. 
Usually, other than that, a couple of first aid

07:34.454 --> 07:46.671
pouches and your water and food and, you know, your 
own personal M16, you know, shells or whatever you

07:34.454 --> 07:46.671
were carrying at the time that way. But you could go 
back to your fire base and pretty much go over to the

07:47.292 --> 07:53.901
ammo bunker and supply anything you wanted, carry 
what you wanted. Some guys were more gung-ho than

07:54.067 --> 07:59.832
others, and they carried a lot more stuff, but 
that's something you kind of learn. And I was

08:00.513 --> 08:12.504
fortunate that I was kind of led by the hand by a 
sergeant when I first went in, and he kind of said,

08:00.513 --> 08:12.504
you don't need this, you need this, you don't need 
this, you need this, and throw this away, you don't

08:00.513 --> 08:12.504
need that. How long had the sergeant been in there? 
He'd been there for, he was on his second tour, so he

08:14.586 --> 08:19.011
was really in his second year, I guess. Did he 
volunteer for it? Oh, yeah. Yeah, he re-upped and

08:20.952 --> 08:23.635
went back in a whole nine yards, so. And he was E5, 
no, not E5, E6. He was an E6. Was he a shake and bake?

08:30.128 --> 08:31.089
No, no, no, no. Okay. No, he had got it through the 
grade type thing. He had not gone to NCO school or

08:34.212 --> 08:36.254
nothing like that. He was just an average Joe type 
guy that had moved up through the grades and not had

08:36.294 --> 08:42.821
any schooling part or anything like that. Yeah, he 
basically learned it by the seat of his pants. And

08:45.684 --> 08:48.186
he had been higher and been demoted. You know, that 
was kind of normal realm. You know, you go up and

08:49.908 --> 08:53.031
down, up and down, and rank like crazy over there. 
and well you you get article 15s you know you go out

08:53.315 --> 09:23.035
and get drunk and shoot up somebody or something or 
whatever and not only kill somebody but i mean you

08:53.315 --> 09:23.035
know go and shoot up a something in town you might go 
into one of the villages and shoot up a bar or

08:53.315 --> 09:23.035
something like that and they oh man i'm gonna knock 
two stripes off of you and demote you and then you

08:53.315 --> 09:23.035
have to go back and two months later you get your 
stripes back or something like that you know

08:53.315 --> 09:23.035
that's our thing but those guys they they raised a 
lot of you know havoc with the locals and stuff like

08:53.315 --> 09:23.035
that but There was all kinds of reasons for going up 
and down in rank. Most people, they really didn't

09:26.484 --> 09:33.515
care a lot of what they did one way or another. They 
were out there just trying to survive. When you say

09:36.098 --> 09:38.101
most people, are you talking about? The grunts, 
the infantry soldiers, yeah. What about the

09:40.885 --> 09:42.368
leaders? The leader guys, most officers were 
really intelligent people. Most of them were

09:46.534 --> 09:48.837
college guys. Their biggest problem was they 
thought they knew more than they did. They really

09:52.132 --> 09:56.960
didn't have a, I don't know, seventh sense or 
whatever you want to call it. They didn't have any

09:57.581 --> 09:59.624
street knowledge of the jungle. They had learned 
it all in a book, and they had no practical

10:00.004 --> 10:05.052
knowledge of what they were doing. You know, you 
get out there in a situation, and, you know, the

10:05.413 --> 10:11.362
lieutenant says, well, let's charge or something 
like that. And everybody looked at that guy and

10:11.403 --> 10:14.067
said, you go ahead, brother. You go ahead. We're 
sitting here. You know, we're not going nowhere.

10:16.998 --> 10:17.860
You know, that's our thing. But, I mean, well, it 
says in page six and six of the, you know, quota

10:17.880 --> 10:24.995
deal, we're supposed to get up and run now or 
something like that, you know. That was the type of

10:25.075 --> 10:31.990
guy you'd run into, and the lieutenants 
especially, they would come over and we'd call

10:25.075 --> 10:31.990
them cherry lieutenants. And we, you know, very 
seldom... kept more than weeks at a time. If they

10:39.097 --> 10:40.862
stayed a month, they were really lucky. The 
lieutenants, they would either get shot by the

10:41.363 --> 10:48.060
enemy or possibly inflict a wound by their own 
side. We'll get back to some of that stuff later. We

10:51.423 --> 10:58.912
did sort of sidetrack here, but the equipment is 
what we were originally on. And I guess to answer

10:59.713 --> 11:06.781
the one question, you never had to take anything 
that you felt was ineffective? No, no, not at all.

11:08.903 --> 11:11.066
No, we always carried what we wanted to. There was 
no forcing there. Like I said, they pretty much

11:13.248 --> 11:19.776
wanted you to carry frags and smokes, but that was 
stuff you wanted to carry anyway, so there was

11:13.248 --> 11:19.776
really no problem there at all. As an intelligence 
analyst, could you in any way, shape, or form see

11:21.241 --> 11:37.686
the effects of the defoliant and the B-52, just the 
general B-52 strikes throughout all the Ho Chi

11:21.241 --> 11:37.686
Minh Trail and everything? Yeah, I could see the 
reason for it. And as an infantry soldier, too.

11:41.752 --> 11:42.292
Right, right. Could you yourself at that point see 
the effect it had on you personally? Right. If it

11:47.420 --> 11:47.821
did. I could see the reasoning for it. Okay. 
Definitely in the thick jungles and stuff, the

11:51.093 --> 12:09.078
defoliants, you know, if we knew there was an area 
where the troop movement was heavy and, you know,

11:51.093 --> 12:09.078
you could not find them or see them or whatever, the 
only alternative you had was to go in there and

11:51.093 --> 12:09.078
spray or call a B-52 strike. And I personally feel, 
you know, and usually this area that it was done in

12:09.098 --> 12:16.128
was a dense, dense jungle. There was no villages 
near it. There was no habitat. So it wasn't

12:19.392 --> 12:22.535
affecting anybody's livelihood or anything like 
that. This is in the mountains or the middle of

12:22.555 --> 12:24.738
nowhere. I mean, granted, it did kill stuff. I'm 
not saying it was right by any means, but it

12:27.661 --> 12:33.427
definitely had a purpose, and I think it served its 
purpose well. It probably, you know, if anything,

12:33.467 --> 12:43.378
you know, if they would have done more than what 
they did, probably would have stepped things up

12:33.467 --> 12:43.378
more, especially the B-52 strikes. Those guys, 
you come in with a B-52 strike in a bumper complex,

12:47.557 --> 12:52.261
And you'd literally wipe out companies of NVA or 
something if you hit them right. Because, you

12:52.321 --> 12:59.788
know, if the bunkers collapsed, depending on how 
they were dug, you know, you'd cave in on them and

12:52.321 --> 12:59.788
just smother them and kill them. Because that was 
their livelihood was to dig in and go down. And that

13:02.951 --> 13:05.253
was the only thing they could do would be go down. If 
they stayed on the surface with a B-52 strike, they

13:05.313 --> 13:08.456
were dead. And so it was a situation that usually 
the defoliant, if you clear out an area where they

13:08.496 --> 13:15.522
were actually at, you know they had nowhere to go 
but down to so you can find the complex is a lot

13:15.991 --> 13:44.800
easier you know so you could find that bunker 
complex you could go in that bunker complex and

13:15.991 --> 13:44.800
flush them out and that was that was like going into 
their home you found out where they lived and you

13:15.991 --> 13:44.800
can get them and you know we had fire bases which 
were sitting out in the open where they always knew

13:15.991 --> 13:44.800
where we were but we never knew where they were so 
the defoliants definitely had their purpose now

13:15.991 --> 13:44.800
granted the spraying on top of our troops and 
People going into areas right after they were

13:44.982 --> 13:51.351
sprayed and stuff, obviously with Agent Orange 
issues and stuff, was not good. I personally never

13:52.693 --> 13:55.156
got sprayed directly. I did go into areas that had 
been sprayed freshly. It was obviously a very,

13:59.482 --> 14:04.389
very toxic chemical. Some of the soldiers knew 
that too. Well, we knew what it was. We knew it was a

14:09.396 --> 14:14.263
defoliant, but we really didn't think that it 
would hurt us. if you follow what I'm saying there.

14:16.282 --> 14:22.328
I mean, you know, just like spraying bug spray at 
home, you know, you know you're killing a bug, but

14:16.282 --> 14:22.328
is this stuff going to kill me? You know, you really 
never think about that too much. You know it has a

14:25.311 --> 14:26.472
purpose. It's after killing the leaves and the 
bushes and the trees so you can see, but will it

14:26.492 --> 14:32.277
really kill you or affect you? There are people who 
have never fallen dead around when it happened,

14:33.018 --> 14:39.965
but, you know, 20 years now after the fact, there's 
people affected by it, obviously. So, you know,

14:40.665 --> 14:42.327
it's a situation that You don't think of a long 
haul. You think of the immediate response. And I

14:45.817 --> 14:47.819
think that's why it happened. They wanted 
something that would work at the time. And it did.

14:51.924 --> 14:53.066
It served its purpose well. And, you know, 
personally, I think it probably was well done. You

14:57.191 --> 15:05.301
know, there's always mistakes and incidents that 
you say, oh, I wish we wouldn't have sprayed then or

14:57.191 --> 15:05.301
we should have got those troops out at that time or 
something like that. So, you know, people did get

15:05.361 --> 15:07.583
affected by it. But overall, I think it was done 
right. I don't really... see anything negative

15:11.770 --> 15:13.752
there whatsoever. It did save American lives. I 
think so. In the long run, it was definitely a

15:16.976 --> 15:18.918
necessity. And, you know, you can't really second 
guess it now because it's been so long, but you go

15:19.299 --> 15:30.351
back and look and say, you know, those guys might 
still be sitting there in those bunker complexes.

15:30.411 --> 15:32.974
We would have never found them. But by 
defoliating, we found the bunker complex or

15:32.994 --> 15:38.481
calling B-52 strike, we were able to knock that 
complex out. Speaking of bunker complexes... Was

15:41.993 --> 15:48.679
it standard Army rules to send a guy down there 
first? No, not really. That was pretty much on your

15:50.161 --> 15:51.342
own. You pretty much, each individual squad, you 
normally would, depending on the situation,

15:51.382 --> 15:59.169
you'd call back and tell them what you found. Okay. 
Okay, report in. Who do you report in to? You report

16:02.232 --> 16:04.294
in usually to your captain or colonel. Usually it 
was just like on our missions, lieutenant would be

16:04.854 --> 16:09.739
the only officer out there with us. Okay, the 
lieutenant would call in, tell the captain what

16:10.175 --> 16:12.958
happened. The captain would tell the colonel. 
They'd call back and say, okay, send some guy down

16:14.579 --> 16:18.282
there and check it out. Or pull back and call an 
artillery. Okay, so depending on the situation or

16:22.146 --> 16:35.598
where it was, if it looked like it was a live bunker, 
that there might still be people in it, we would

16:22.146 --> 16:35.598
usually pull back and call an artillery and try to 
blow it up a little bit and then go in and try to find

16:22.146 --> 16:35.598
stuff. Or they might send dogs out to run through it 
or something like that. You know, they had trained

16:40.195 --> 17:04.937
dogs over there that did that sort of thing so you 
know there was there was all kinds of different

16:40.195 --> 17:04.937
things but no it wasn't standard procedure send 
somebody down immediately we normally would back

16:40.195 --> 17:04.937
up and call in and ask for what they want us to do 
mention artillery now that that brings up a

16:40.195 --> 17:04.937
question and the question about artillery since 
you did spend so much time in the jungle Did you ever

17:05.558 --> 17:11.507
see cases where the artillery was ineffective 
because it was exploding in the treetops? Oh,

17:11.527 --> 17:12.709
yeah. Was that frequent? Did you account for that 
by saying send in twice the amount of rounds? Well,

17:17.536 --> 17:25.348
you just kept calling for it if you needed it, and if 
it blew up the trees, eventually the trees would be

17:17.536 --> 17:25.348
blown up and it would get down to where you needed 
it. Okay. So, I mean, you just had to call for more of

17:26.710 --> 17:28.653
it. Okay. But, yes, we did see it. especially in the 
real dense jungle and stuff like that. Did any of

17:34.173 --> 17:37.957
the fragments ever hit? We would get shrapnel from 
it, yes. As a matter of fact, I had one small wound in

17:41.041 --> 17:49.592
my back from fragments from a, I think it was 
probably a 105 round or something. It was an altar

17:49.732 --> 17:58.743
we called in that hit real close to us, and just 
little pieces of metal would fly up and hit you and

17:49.732 --> 17:58.743
burn you more than anything else. It wasn't 
anything severe. But that stuff would be

18:00.318 --> 18:02.922
dangerous if you were close enough to it. And the 
white phosphorus was really bad. I don't know if

18:05.626 --> 18:08.189
you've ever seen a white phosphorus. We call them 
willy peats. They come in and hit, and you see the

18:09.772 --> 18:13.397
white smoke stuff going up. And if that stuff ever 
hit you and got on your body, it would just burn

18:13.838 --> 18:17.062
right through you. It was terrible. That's all it 
was, was just heat? It was heat, white phosphorus

18:19.926 --> 18:24.112
is what it was, the actual chemical phosphorus. 
And it would be burning. When it hit, it would

18:25.354 --> 18:27.237
explode and go out. And if that stuff, if you were 
anywhere near a white phosphorus when it went off

18:27.706 --> 18:35.015
and got on you, I mean, it would just hit you and just 
start burning your skin and eating you up. On which

18:35.035 --> 18:37.358
situations would you call in white phosphorus? If 
we knew of a large concentrate of enemy on the

18:37.518 --> 18:42.164
ground. And you had to call it in? We called in, you 
know, what really beats. What we normally would

18:45.849 --> 18:51.496
do, first couple of rounds, we'd call in marker 
rounds, and they'd come in and hit. And if we knew it

18:51.616 --> 18:56.542
was right on the money where they were, then we'd 
say, okay, shell it with white phosphorus. Go for

18:56.922 --> 18:57.443
it. And we knew, say, like, if we had them 
surrounded and we knew they were there and we

18:57.659 --> 19:06.070
wanted to get them out or kill them, we'd call in one 
of these rounds of white phosphorus. And, man,

19:06.110 --> 19:10.775
they'd just stand up and start running and 
screaming, you know, just burning them like

19:06.110 --> 19:10.775
crazy. I mean, you can see them. You know, it was 
very obvious, very effective, very effective

19:12.578 --> 19:15.521
stuff. And the purpose that it served. Yes, 
definitely. Is there any equipment that we

19:18.385 --> 19:20.848
haven't discussed that? Not really. There were 
some flamethrowers that we saw every once in a

19:22.277 --> 19:28.383
while, but this was more specialized stuff that I 
didn't personally come in contact with. I saw it

19:28.483 --> 19:29.604
several times. There was basically special units 
like your mortar units. They would carry mortars

19:35.571 --> 19:40.436
on their backs out there, and they'd set up in there 
and pop mortars and stuff. They had different

19:40.456 --> 19:45.301
things, and then the actual artillery guys had 
their different cannons and stuff. The 105s and

19:45.321 --> 19:47.663
155s would shoot stuff. And they would carry them 
out there sometimes in the jungle with

19:48.031 --> 19:53.138
helicopters and set them down and shoot. You know, 
if they had to get to a special area, they'd set up a

19:53.779 --> 20:02.690
little area and start shooting, you know, and set 
up a little base of their own and, you know, form

19:53.779 --> 20:02.690
their own little fire base. So, you know, you'd be 
sitting there and if you, you know, were in an area

20:02.710 --> 20:13.785
where they couldn't get to you by anything like 
that, they might set something up to shoot or they

20:02.710 --> 20:13.785
might call in, the Air Force might come in and, The 
Air Force had what I call a push and pull, like a

20:14.002 --> 20:20.128
Cessna had a motor in the front and back, and they 
carried rockets on the wings. And those things

20:20.969 --> 20:23.091
were really good for blowing up bridges. And then 
they could come in real accurately and shoot these

20:24.031 --> 20:30.177
rockets off these wings of these Cessnas and blow 
up bridges that we'd come across. Did you ever see

20:30.477 --> 20:31.899
any of them go down? Were they susceptible to... 
Yeah, they were fairly susceptible, although

20:32.359 --> 20:41.308
they'd fly low and fast, like the choppers. There 
again, your choppers, your Actual troop

20:44.208 --> 20:48.053
transport, Huey, wasn't that effective because 
it was so slow. But they had what I call a loach,

20:48.533 --> 20:59.407
which is a smaller chopper that carried 
20-millimeter cannon and, of course, your door

20:48.533 --> 20:59.407
gun or your either .50 caliber or your M60s machine 
guns. And they were very active and fast. They were

21:01.249 --> 21:05.294
kind of a search-and-destroy type thing. And 
then, of course, the actual Cobras, the gunships

21:05.334 --> 21:08.798
they call them, Those guys, man, they could come in 
and just unbelievably put out a spray of bullets

21:09.065 --> 21:14.250
and stuff. Usually if we were going into an area 
that we felt was enemy and we had to sit down, the

21:14.711 --> 21:23.580
Cobras would go in first and just blow up the area. I 
mean, just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, blow it

21:23.781 --> 21:25.482
up. And then we'd come in and get out and try to 
secure the area before the troop movement would

21:25.803 --> 21:31.469
come in. But the Cobras were really... put out a lot 
of firepower. They were very effective weapons.

21:35.991 --> 21:37.212
Two things to have on your side. Yes, definitely. 
All right, we're going to sort of switch subjects

21:38.694 --> 21:43.841
here and start speaking about leaders. Okay. Who 
or what was the highest rank in the fire base?

21:48.467 --> 21:49.208
Usually colonels. They had what they call a full 
bird colonel, you know, and that was usually the

21:49.869 --> 21:55.356
highest rank on the fire base. uh... what was his 
average rotation how long would he be around most

21:55.808 --> 22:25.157
colonels would stay for quite some time they they 
were the quote there again lifers and uh... you

21:55.808 --> 22:25.157
know i'd various well both two instances in the 
hunter first and the uh... first cab well i only

21:55.808 --> 22:25.157
worked with one colonel in both places so i mean we 
didn't have really a turnover of my direct

21:55.808 --> 22:25.157
colonels you know that way they usually stayed 
right there the colonel was you know they pretty

21:55.808 --> 22:25.157
much stayed in command of that particular unit, 
you know, at that time. Now, were there any

22:30.061 --> 22:32.403
Fragans? And also, what rank did they involve? 
Yes, quite a bit. There's more in the lower ranks

22:37.707 --> 22:45.494
with the actual lieutenants, a few captains every 
once in a while, but mainly lieutenants. And it

22:46.115 --> 22:54.942
would usually happen either in the field or in the 
rear areas after a conflict out in the field,

22:46.115 --> 22:54.942
basically. Usually as far as the instance where in 
the field somebody might get shot in the back

22:55.411 --> 23:02.841
rather than a frag. And your fragging instance 
happened in your hoochers at night and stuff like

23:04.063 --> 23:08.309
that. They would actually be asleep or somebody 
would go through and just drop a frag in your thing.

23:15.319 --> 23:18.643
There was fragging incidents in the local bars and 
stuff every once in a while. If they knew a guy would

23:18.663 --> 23:24.912
be in there that they wanted to get, they would 
actually frag the whole bar. so it wouldn't be a

23:25.280 --> 23:28.443
direct hit on one particular person. So nobody 
could really be blamed for one thing. And then at

23:32.286 --> 23:38.032
that time also, they could blame it on the VC or 
local villagers or some shit like that. So, but it,

23:38.612 --> 23:47.560
you know, we knew, you know, the guys that talk bad 
about him in the company, they get high on drugs and

23:38.612 --> 23:47.560
they say, I'm going to kill that guy. You know, he's 
not going to go back out on another mission with me.

23:50.663 --> 23:53.085
And, you know, next day they got to be dead, you 
know. So you knew it happened. Yeah, but nobody

23:55.216 --> 23:57.386
ever proved it or anything. There was never any 
court-martials or any direct things from any

24:00.785 --> 24:03.228
instance that I was aware of. Although, we went 
through lots of lieutenants up there, especially

24:03.609 --> 24:07.574
in six months. I probably went through eight, nine 
lieutenants in six months' time. Among the DMZ? In

24:12.180 --> 24:13.522
the DMZ, yeah. Did you, I guess you didn't have to 
work with any shake-and-bake lieutenants when

24:13.542 --> 24:18.189
you were at the first cab? No, not really. I was 
working more with the higher officers and, you

24:19.771 --> 24:25.979
know, lifers and stuff, and really didn't see it 
that much there. Everybody was more of the

24:26.019 --> 24:30.285
seasoned veteran kind when I was in the first cab 
where when I was in the 101st, it was more of the

24:31.058 --> 24:40.293
rookies and the shake and bakes, like you said, and 
the guys that really didn't know what they were

24:31.058 --> 24:40.293
doing. They'd just been to a training school and 
learned it out of a book. They had no practical

24:43.439 --> 24:44.701
knowledge. When I was working in intelligence, 
most intelligence guys had years of service, and a

24:45.161 --> 24:53.716
lot of them had been unarmed for one or two tours. So 
I was really the rookie. I was very fortunate to get

24:56.067 --> 24:59.191
in at the right time when I got there. I just was at 
the right place at the right time for those deals. I

25:02.095 --> 25:09.685
got real lucky to get actually pulled out of the, 
you know, regular, you know, foot soldier type

25:02.095 --> 25:09.685
activity and start flying a little more that way. 
As an infantry soldier, who'd you listen to up

25:10.486 --> 25:14.912
along the DMZ and the 103rd? Mostly the sergeants. 
Very seldom listen to the officers. Did you

25:18.697 --> 25:19.898
yourself just ignore the officers too? Pretty 
much, yeah. Okay. You really... I kind of got taken

25:23.912 --> 25:29.920
under the wing of that sergeant, like I was saying, 
and you can tell who knows what. And then you listen

25:30.261 --> 25:32.403
to your own gut feeling, too. You know whether that 
lieutenant's telling you the right thing or not.

25:36.829 --> 25:40.333
Now, a lot of guys didn't know, and a lot of guys 
died. It's just simple as that. I'm not saying they

25:42.696 --> 25:48.784
were wrong, but at the same time, people died 
because of what they told them to do. So, you know, I

25:49.725 --> 25:51.808
never... quote directly disobeyed a direct order 
although I would question it a lot of times and say

25:51.957 --> 26:19.838
let's talk about this guys you know or you know some 
instances you know they would say do something and

25:51.957 --> 26:19.838
I wouldn't directly do it I would do what I felt was 
right within the means of what they were saying

25:51.957 --> 26:19.838
well um I basically just in a day type thing we would 
be moving during the day time We would have to walk

26:20.273 --> 26:27.103
so many feet apart, supposedly, and more or less in 
a certain pattern. And we had hand signals because

26:27.944 --> 26:31.489
there was no talking or anything like this. So we'd 
be going along, and all of a sudden we'd take

26:31.529 --> 26:38.059
incoming fire, sniper fire. We basically hit the 
ground initially and spread out. And we would sit

26:45.069 --> 26:50.196
there, and of course the lieutenant would try to 
find out where it came from all right then he would

26:50.547 --> 27:17.061
say okay you you and you let's go and you say yeah 
wait a minute do we really want to get up and start

26:50.547 --> 27:17.061
running with this guy shooting at us or not and so 
you know usually the sergeant would enter act at

26:50.547 --> 27:17.061
that time and say wait a minute wait a minute and the 
sergeant would get there and talk to the

26:50.547 --> 27:17.061
lieutenant and they sit there and talk it over and 
then we might do something different or if he says

26:50.547 --> 27:17.061
let's go this way I might go that way, but I wouldn't 
necessarily go with them. I might do my own little

27:20.679 --> 27:23.302
maneuvering or something like that. I would 
basically do what I wanted to do within the means of

27:23.803 --> 27:27.688
what I was told. I reckon that's where you're 
tracking. Right, exactly. You're a little bit

27:30.992 --> 27:33.896
more comfortable going away from the group. 
Right. I wasn't a loner by any means. I wasn't a

27:38.362 --> 27:40.244
gung-ho guy. I was just trying to stay alive. A lot 
of times, we got hit one time and He said he wanted us

27:47.095 --> 27:48.998
all to get up and run. He said, let's pull out, let's 
go. And I, you know, I looked at the sergeant and we

27:50.941 --> 27:56.428
both shook our heads and we ain't going nowhere. 
You know, and Lieutenant says, let's go, let's go,

27:57.370 --> 27:59.954
let's go. And he said, bye, go. So Lieutenant and 
about six guys took off. The other six of us stayed

28:08.065 --> 28:09.367
there. Those guys got killed. Wow. You know, and, 
you know, we just knew Our best bet was to stay put

28:15.985 --> 28:21.290
because we had no idea how many enemy were out 
there. We didn't know what the force was. We didn't

28:22.612 --> 28:23.713
know where they were. We knew we were being shot at. 
We were pinned down. Our best bet was to call an

28:27.877 --> 28:36.946
artillery or just wait them out and find out where 
they were and try to, you know, get them. But he

28:36.966 --> 28:39.609
wanted to run, and he ran. He ran right into an 
ambush, and they blew him down, man, mowed him all

28:39.669 --> 28:42.972
down. And, you know, as it turned out, we called in 
artillery, and the guys pulled back, and then they

28:43.762 --> 28:54.358
flew in and picked us up in a chopper, and we got out 
of there without a scratch. So, you know, it's just

28:55.419 --> 28:58.684
common sense more than anything else. The 
lieutenants just didn't seem to have it. Did any

29:02.991 --> 29:05.795
higher-ranking officers go out with y'all? 
Captain was the highest that ever really directly

29:05.835 --> 29:09.280
went in the field with me. And normally the— 
captains yeah the captains you know they

29:12.618 --> 29:40.566
basically you know they would run everything you 
know when they were out there and the deal with the

29:12.618 --> 29:40.566
captains usually you know it would be in a large 
masses so it would be like a major movement of five

29:12.618 --> 29:40.566
or six squads or whatever in the company so I never 
directly personally got associated with the

29:12.618 --> 29:40.566
captains What I saw with the fragging of the 
captains was with the sergeants, because your

29:40.833 --> 29:50.083
sergeants and your lieutenants would interact 
with the captain basically on their talking. You

29:50.103 --> 29:54.107
know, you'd come in and they'd have little 
pow-wows and they'd say, okay, let's go do this.

29:54.748 --> 30:02.096
And usually what would happen was, you know, some 
guy's getting short, didn't want to go out on night

29:54.748 --> 30:02.096
patrol or something like that, and the captain 
would say, you've got to go. And, you know, I ain't

30:02.156 --> 30:05.039
going nowhere, man. You know, I'm staying in here. 
I'm going to go out and get my blow away. So the next

30:08.035 --> 30:12.400
thing you know, the captain got shot or he got 
fragged or something, you know. And usually that

30:13.381 --> 30:17.767
would happen with the sergeants more than the 
lower rank. Where the lower ranker guys, the

30:18.167 --> 30:26.057
privates, PFCs, whatever, specialists, they 
would be the ones that seemed to be taking care of

30:18.167 --> 30:26.057
the lieutenants. So it was kind of a chain of 
command type thing that way. What happened? What

30:31.303 --> 30:32.264
do you think happened? Why did this blatant 
breakdown of chain of command? Well... I really,

30:38.647 --> 30:49.283
in myself, I personally never got mad enough or 
upset enough at anyone to try to shoot them. I

30:49.864 --> 30:57.656
disagreed with them a lot, and I didn't do that many 
drugs over there, so I was straight, especially in

30:49.864 --> 30:57.656
the field. But I think drugs might have had a lot to 
do with it. A guy would get really doped up on coke or

31:02.644 --> 31:06.730
heroin, be shooting heroin like crazy. And, you 
know, he didn't want to go out there and get shot at.

31:10.163 --> 31:12.505
And this guy's telling the direct order to go get 
shot. And he might bust him. They might give him

31:13.926 --> 31:15.667
Article 15 or something. So here's this 
lieutenant or captain saying, you ain't going out

31:15.687 --> 31:19.050
there, man. You're in trouble. You know, the guy's 
all messed up on drugs. So they send him back to the

31:23.294 --> 31:25.276
rear area, bust him. And next time the captain 
comes back to the rear area, he's dead. You know, so

31:30.581 --> 31:33.844
a personal vendetta type thing more than anything 
else. And, you know, it. It was, I don't know if it

31:37.220 --> 31:42.687
was all drug-related, but the drugs were very, 
very prevalent, especially when I was there. They

31:43.108 --> 31:49.937
were trying to stand down and send people home, so 
they were actually running drug tests in the

31:43.108 --> 31:49.937
field. I mean, there might be a chopper fly in, and 
they pass around the bottles and make you urinate

31:50.357 --> 32:04.095
in them, and if you had drugs in your urine, then 
they would pull you out of the field and send you to a

31:50.357 --> 32:04.095
drug rehab center or something like that. And if 
that happened, then you got busted. And you

32:06.802 --> 32:07.663
couldn't go home. So the only way you could get back 
out of the war to go home was to be clean, period. And

32:15.032 --> 32:20.178
if you wanted any kind of dishonorable or 
honorable discharge or anything like that, you

32:15.032 --> 32:20.178
had to be clean. And they told you that up front, 
man. You guys get off drugs, get straight if you

32:22.961 --> 32:27.106
want to go home and have any honors or anything. So a 
lot of the veterans that are, quote, complaining

32:27.487 --> 32:35.336
they didn't get the right bill or whatever, they 
brought it on themselves. I mean, I don't want to

32:35.737 --> 32:36.758
say... Everybody did, but a lot of them had the 
choice. I had the choice. Yeah. And, I mean,

32:42.813 --> 32:45.936
concerning drugs and everything else. I mean, I'm 
not saying I didn't use drugs, because I did. But I

32:49.139 --> 32:50.260
didn't get hooked on it. I wasn't addicted to it. 
But I never knew whether I was going to live until

32:51.741 --> 32:53.883
the next day. And it was there. It was prevalent. 
You know, I was young. I was vulnerable. I said, you

32:59.108 --> 33:00.650
know, why not smoke some joints? Why not snort some 
coke, you know? Hell, if it feels good, why not do

33:02.771 --> 33:04.333
it? I might not live until tomorrow. But I only did 
it in rear areas where I was not affected by my

33:06.337 --> 33:13.225
livelihood of being shot at or whatever. When you 
say rear areas, that doesn't include the fire

33:13.285 --> 33:16.649
bases? Not the outer fire bases, no. They had major 
base camps in the rear areas. Oh, yes. Yeah, drugs

33:23.357 --> 33:24.418
were everywhere. Well, describe when you say 
everywhere. I mean, were they done openly? Oh,

33:28.162 --> 33:28.483
yes. Joints smoked openly? Joints smoked openly. 
We had little vials of cocaine that were... Just a

33:35.041 --> 33:38.466
little glass vial with a black lid on them. And, you 
know, the guys, it was just pure, I mean, we're

33:38.486 --> 33:44.956
talking pure, pure cocaine. And heroin also. And 
you snort the cocaine or you lace your marijuana

33:47.139 --> 33:50.824
with the cocaine and smoke it. And then guys would 
shoot up, you know, the medics all had needles and

33:51.906 --> 33:56.953
stuff, so it was very easy to get needles. And you'd 
get your heroin and you'd, you know, shoot your

33:57.614 --> 34:01.300
heroin up. And, you know, you'd get just pure vials 
of heroin. And you'd buy it, you know, from the

34:04.403 --> 34:08.569
locals, all had it. So, I mean, if you wanted the 
stuff, all you had to say, hey, man, yeah, I need

34:09.410 --> 34:14.797
some heroin or whatever, and bam, you had it. Mama 
signs, papa signs, every village you walked

34:14.997 --> 34:17.681
through, you could get it. Did that ever occur to 
any of the soldiers that probably that money went

34:18.602 --> 34:23.969
to the B.C.? Very possibly. We were told that all 
the time. And we were told that, you know, all we

34:26.733 --> 34:29.797
were doing was supporting the B.C. Of course, you 
know, a lot of these guys could care less. They just

34:32.697 --> 34:36.723
wanted to support their habit or feel good or 
whatever, you know, from that standpoint. Now,

34:37.243 --> 34:41.709
there was a lot of sergeants and lieutenants that 
didn't like it. And if you were caught smoking

34:42.911 --> 34:51.742
drugs and doing drugs, you know, they would kick 
your rank down and they'd court-martial you and

34:42.911 --> 34:51.742
send you back and stuff like that. So, I mean, you 
know, you stood the chance of getting in trouble.

34:56.388 --> 34:58.932
How many sergeants and lieutenants were doing 
drugs? I mean, were there... Quite a few. Oh, yeah,

35:01.070 --> 35:05.916
it was very, you know, all the way through the 
ranks. Captains did it. I never saw any colonels do

35:06.717 --> 35:08.158
anything. I saw captains and lieutenants smoking 
all the time, you know. So it was not, it was

35:12.343 --> 35:13.985
everybody. And kind of there was the ones that did 
and the ones that didn't. I mean, I'm not saying

35:18.310 --> 35:20.913
everybody did drugs because everybody didn't. 
Personally, I did half the time, half the time I

35:23.216 --> 35:25.919
didn't. So I wasn't real bad, although... 
Initially, I didn't smoke or do anything. Then I

35:30.989 --> 35:32.791
got in and got introduced to it. Once I got 
introduced to it, every time I went back to the rear

35:33.452 --> 35:37.938
area, I looked forward to it. But I did it while I was 
there for a couple of days, and then I got off of it.

35:42.304 --> 35:47.310
Then I'd go out for weeks and weeks at a time, and I 
wasn't ever addicted, so I didn't have to have it.

35:47.330 --> 35:58.465
Although, when I'd go back to a fire base in the rear 
area or something, I'd smoke some dope and start

35:47.330 --> 35:58.465
some coke and get laid back and some drink and just 
totally get blitzed for a couple of days. Then I'd

35:58.833 --> 36:00.575
go back out and fight again. So it sounds like it was 
almost accepted among the chain of command

36:02.136 --> 36:07.681
anyhow. Very much so. There again, it wasn't 
everybody. I mean, you could get in to the cliques

36:11.464 --> 36:16.008
and do it. But you didn't do it in front of 
everybody, although it was done in the open.

36:25.837 --> 36:26.277
Let's see. Where do we go from here, Steve? I guess 
with the drugs and also some of the quote unquote

36:28.482 --> 36:43.877
stupidity of the leaders, it definitely looks 
like it affected the infantry in the sense that

36:28.482 --> 36:43.877
they didn't really listen. You think maybe both 
those things contributed to the breakdown of the

36:44.878 --> 36:49.102
command? Possibly. I think the intelligence of 
the person that was there also, the average person

36:50.804 --> 36:57.831
that was an infantry soldier, was not even of high 
school education. Did you know the average age of

37:02.787 --> 37:08.893
the Vietnam soldier is 18? I was going to say it 
probably wasn't even more than 18 years old, so

37:08.913 --> 37:16.179
most of them didn't even finish high school, or if 
they did, barely got out of high school. So they

37:18.281 --> 37:19.683
were not educated. Most of them basically were 
from poor families, blacks, Hispanics, were very

37:28.186 --> 37:30.169
prominent in the service. They didn't want to be 
there, they didn't care about being there, so I

37:31.771 --> 37:44.086
think the education and just the flat attitude of 
the person affected it more than anything else.

37:44.246 --> 37:48.452
Going in, that was their feeling, and they could 
care less. Then there was the guys that, I guess I

37:49.733 --> 37:55.020
feel like myself, elite by any means, because 
there was a lot of people in my same thing. I was just

37:58.797 --> 38:00.058
an average guy. They got drafted. And just my 
common sense and my bringing up made me survive.

38:10.769 --> 38:15.194
But the majority of guys that got killed did it 
themselves. I mean, you know, they were just

38:15.754 --> 38:19.979
stupid or they didn't listen. You know, from that 
standpoint. And Yeah, you try to work, especially

38:23.485 --> 38:26.109
guys in your squad. You've got six or seven guys 
you're working with every day, and this guy's got

38:26.129 --> 38:32.278
to cover your ass as well as you cover his. Okay, so 
from that standpoint, you get to be really close to

38:32.939 --> 38:37.005
these guys. But at the same time, you don't want to 
get too close because if they get blown away, you

38:37.546 --> 38:43.214
don't want to be personally affected by it. But you 
learn about them, you learn their habits, the way

38:43.234 --> 38:49.003
they feel, and the... colored people the blacks 
gotten clicks and they did their daps they call it

38:49.270 --> 39:17.640
where they put their hands in their hands and their 
feet and all this sort of thing and i mean they

38:49.270 --> 39:17.640
really had their own little thing and you know some 
of the colored guys you know you couldn't even get

38:49.270 --> 39:17.640
in with them at all the white guy or you know the 
hispanic guy was out totally and you know so you had

38:49.270 --> 39:17.640
to really know them and work with my particular 
squad there was i think eight black guys and I got to

39:18.177 --> 39:46.446
know them pretty well and they accepted me and they 
realized that I knew what I was doing and you know

39:18.177 --> 39:46.446
from that standpoint I was fortunate and there was 
a couple guys you know they'd come and go all the

39:18.177 --> 39:46.446
time there was always movement of people you know 
guys would get short and they'd go home and then

39:18.177 --> 39:46.446
guys would get killed or wounded and they'd leave 
and they'd always replace them with somebody new

39:18.177 --> 39:46.446
and here comes the new guy doesn't know anything 
and usually the first week or so they got there

39:46.797 --> 40:10.780
nobody talk to him and I can you is this oh yeah I mean 
good what good one get around it because it was

39:46.797 --> 40:10.780
dangerous yeah yeah they want to try from the well 
normally sergeant if anybody would take

39:46.797 --> 40:10.780
initiative to do that would be the sergeant and 
that was there again in my case the sergeant really

39:46.797 --> 40:10.780
helped me out he came in and But the average guy 
would not even talk to them at all. They just

40:16.998 --> 40:18.660
wouldn't associate with them at all. And your 
actual platoon, per se, the turnover was just

40:19.801 --> 40:26.827
phenomenal. Like every week there seemed to be 
somebody new. And of course the captains and

40:29.609 --> 40:35.635
lieutenants were always hollering for 
replacements needing to fill up the numbers of

40:29.609 --> 40:35.635
people. And we'd go out short all the time because 
there'd be a turnover of people. You never know you

40:41.050 --> 40:43.193
know, from one mission to the next, and you have. 
Well, this leads up to a question. Do you think that

40:46.337 --> 40:54.288
if y'all just had a smaller number of more 
experienced guys, would that have done a, would

40:46.337 --> 40:54.288
y'all have been more effective? I think so. 
There's no doubt about that. And it's sort of like

40:56.290 --> 40:58.113
your intelligence unit. Right. It sounds like. 
Right. Those people are. Correct me if I'm wrong,

41:01.197 --> 41:05.242
but did y'all work in smaller groups with the 
intelligence unit? Definitely. Definitely,

41:05.975 --> 41:14.928
yeah, you know, four, three, four-man groups, and 
kind of like a special services or, you know, Green

41:05.975 --> 41:14.928
Beret, whatever you want to call them. They were 
more experienced, better trained, more time in

41:16.811 --> 41:22.259
service, more time in country, whatever. And, you 
know, they knew what they were doing, where the

41:23.081 --> 41:28.689
average, you know, infantry grunt did not. And 
you're exactly right, but they were going for the

41:29.811 --> 41:34.598
numbers of bodies and firepower with the 
companies and the platoons. And, you know, so from

41:40.011 --> 41:48.123
that standpoint, you know, they'd feel that 
they'd send 50 people out there, you know, they

41:40.011 --> 41:48.123
felt they would be better rather than send 10 that 
were qualified. So, you know, if you know what I

41:48.764 --> 41:50.046
mean. So they were fighting the number game more 
than anything else at that stage of the game. And,

41:54.853 --> 41:59.621
you know, they felt that if, you know, the enemy saw 
50 guys coming with rifles, they'd run. Or if they

42:00.482 --> 42:03.927
saw 10 guys coming, they might try to stay there and 
fight them and ambush them. your personal opinion

42:04.379 --> 42:07.182
on that? I think it would have been more effective 
with more trained personnel. I think the training

42:09.645 --> 42:12.968
was terrible for the average infantry soldier. 
Okay. And, you know, they were not properly

42:14.009 --> 42:17.593
trained to go fight in a war. There's no doubt in my 
mind. Vietnam War? Vietnam War. Any war. Any war.

42:22.639 --> 42:22.739
Okay. I really... The training was not there. And 
now, you know, it's a situation... Yes, I knew the

42:29.045 --> 42:30.127
basics. You know, everybody got the basics. 
But... I mean, you walk into Vietnam, I mean,

42:34.147 --> 42:38.551
you're just like going cold turkey. You don't know 
nothing. I mean, you know, you're sitting there

42:40.692 --> 42:43.515
like, oh, wow, here I am. I'm in the middle of 
nowhere. I got a gun, you know. You don't know what

42:46.037 --> 42:47.258
you're looking for. You don't know what the enemy 
looks like. You don't know what tactics you're

42:49.820 --> 42:52.102
supposed to be using. You don't know anything. 
And, you know, I don't know what the actual

42:54.244 --> 43:04.052
statistic was, but I would say the average 
infantry soldier died within the first three or

42:54.244 --> 43:04.052
four months he was in country. I mean, if they lived 
three months, they usually made it through their

43:05.045 --> 43:08.809
tour. Yeah. Also said the same for lieutenants. 
Right, exactly. If they could make it for the first

43:14.334 --> 43:18.678
two or three months in country, then they survived 
the whole tour. And that's why people came back. I

43:21.000 --> 43:26.365
mean, in all honesty, if I wouldn't have been 
married and the war wouldn't have been winding

43:21.000 --> 43:26.365
down, I probably would have wanted to go back. You 
know, it's a situation that, not that I enjoyed it

43:27.346 --> 43:34.933
by any means, but at the same time, it got to a point 
where I felt comfortable with it. Was there a

43:35.740 --> 43:40.407
certain camaraderie among how it attracted you? 
Oh, yes, definitely. The camaraderie was

43:41.909 --> 43:43.531
definitely there. Once you get with people that 
know what they're doing and you feel comfortable

43:43.571 --> 43:50.141
with them, then it's very exciting. You never know 
what the next day is going to bring. There's always

43:53.946 --> 43:55.268
something different. But you felt comfortable 
enough that you'd be able to handle it? Oh, yes,

43:58.673 --> 44:00.155
definitely. This is going to sort of sidetrack, 
but I want to go ahead and do it anyways. What were

44:05.710 --> 44:08.675
your views on war? I mean, like, you know, is it a 
Rambo type? Did you ever, before you went to

44:12.802 --> 44:24.382
Vietnam, just your general views on war, if you 
even had any, was it a John Wayne type, you know,

44:12.802 --> 44:24.382
shoot them up, shoot the Indians, and we'll always 
know? Well, my basic view of war has been more or

44:24.402 --> 44:29.912
less from the movies, you know. And World War II, 
World War I, Korea, that sort of thing, where you

44:30.365 --> 44:39.557
basically see these masses of people walking with 
their guns and walking over fields shooting at

44:30.365 --> 44:39.557
people. And it's just like a massive overtaking. 
And then you're sitting there shooting and you

44:42.642 --> 44:50.011
take a hill or you take a bunker complex or 
something like that. Or you see the dive bombers

44:50.612 --> 44:54.818
coming in, dropping their bombs or something like 
that. And that's what we were taught war was.

44:58.951 --> 45:02.515
That's the way I grew up, knowing what war was. You 
play Army or something with your little model men

45:03.015 --> 45:11.043
and stuff, and you got this line of guys here and a 
line of guys there, and they just sit there and

45:03.015 --> 45:11.043
shoot at each other, that sort of thing. So this 
type of war was not like that at all. It was more of a

45:15.628 --> 45:18.350
guerrilla. You never really could see your enemy 
that much, and it definitely wasn't the masses

45:18.831 --> 45:26.899
overtaking type thing where you just walk up and 
start shooting. And, of course, you know, you go

45:27.250 --> 45:33.357
all the way back to the original Minutemen and 
stuff like that, and you hear all these new

45:27.250 --> 45:33.357
Redcoats are coming here. They come walking and 
shooting the thing, and you're sitting there

45:33.377 --> 45:38.383
shooting them, you know, the war between the 
states and everything else. You know, that's the

45:38.403 --> 45:42.607
type of battles you see where just a line of people 
running and each other shooting, you know. It just

45:43.148 --> 45:44.189
wasn't like that. So from that standpoint, that's 
what I envisioned it to be. Okay. And so when you get

45:50.376 --> 45:55.722
there and you walk into this jungle and you're 
sitting there looking around, And then you can't

45:56.039 --> 45:58.270
see 20 feet in front of you. You say, I can't see 
nobody. How the hell am I going to shoot them?
