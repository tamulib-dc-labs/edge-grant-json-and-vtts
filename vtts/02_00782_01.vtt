00:02.461 --> 00:10.472
This is Deborah Beale, and I'm interviewing Mr. 
Franklin Sequeira on the history of Texas

00:02.461 --> 00:10.472
Engineering Experiment Station. The date is June 
13, 1984. I've already given a little

00:12.475 --> 00:21.027
introductory, but I'd like for you to tell me what 
your background is. Okay. Well, my background has

00:21.327 --> 00:28.958
basically been in new business ventures and 
private industry.

00:30.743 --> 00:40.956
I guess ever since I got out of college I've been 
interested in business start-ups, and I've been

00:30.743 --> 00:40.956
involved in a number of them under the umbrella of 
major corporations. So I was manager of special

00:42.158 --> 00:58.860
projects at North American Aviation in Columbus, 
Ohio, where we did some work in setting up joint

00:42.158 --> 00:58.860
ventures on commercial aircraft, even though 
this was a military aircraft main venture. some

00:59.397 --> 01:06.284
joint maintenance work with another aircraft 
firm, or aircraft leasing firm, some

00:59.397 --> 01:06.284
manufacturing ventures. And I left North 
American Aviation in 1970, went to

01:06.805 --> 01:23.923
Continental Can Company, as it was known as in 
those days, as head of research and engineering

01:06.805 --> 01:23.923
planning for the can company. And there we were 
looking at new packaging ventures, I had about 30

01:26.583 --> 01:32.292
people working for me, about half of them were 
planners, the other half were administrators and

01:26.583 --> 01:32.292
typewriters. From there I went to Can Company 
headquarters as the Can Company director of new

01:34.575 --> 01:44.350
business ventures and we set up some venture 
capital operations. From that to the corporate

01:44.370 --> 01:52.742
office in New York as corporate manager of 
acquisitions and mergers.

01:54.730 --> 02:01.977
I'm the corporate general manager of technology 
and venture operations, and I'm finally vice

01:54.730 --> 02:01.977
president and general manager of a startup. So 
I've been involved in high-tech business startup

02:02.938 --> 02:10.706
operations probably most of my business life. How 
did Taze come to know about you? Oh, well, I

02:13.749 --> 02:16.391
answered a Wall Street Journal ad. It sounded like 
something that was just tailored to what I wanted

02:16.892 --> 02:22.257
to do. After 12 years at Continental, they decided 
that they were going to stick more to existing

02:22.793 --> 02:31.164
businesses rather than creating new ones. And the 
past five years have been very exciting. We were

02:34.789 --> 02:42.199
involved in developing new high-energy density 
batteries, new pharmaceuticals. We got an

02:42.560 --> 02:48.287
anti-addictive drug that we were taking through 
FDA approval. This would be allowing an alcoholic

02:48.648 --> 02:51.872
to detoxify without trauma. It seemed to have 
anti-heron and anti-nicotine properties. We had

02:56.820 --> 03:00.304
a topical cure for herpes 2. At least that's the way 
it was testing out in the laboratory. It hadn't

03:05.310 --> 03:08.013
gone to human tests or anything. And the company I 
started at Continental was called Continental

03:08.033 --> 03:13.378
Power Systems Incorporated. And that was a 
company that had licensed a new form of electrical

03:13.659 --> 03:20.406
generator and variable speed AC motor. And we were 
starting that up. got a new chairman of the board.

03:24.629 --> 03:27.834
He said, well, we're going to make cans and punch 
holes in the Gulf of Mexico. And I saw the ads and

03:29.838 --> 03:31.681
said, wow. Looks better in Texas than it does in 
Connecticut. Was this your first venture in

03:36.949 --> 03:39.674
Texas? Well, we were running the pharmaceutical 
venture down in Houston. We had a program office

03:44.350 --> 03:50.857
down there, and if you're asking me is this the 
first time I've lived in Texas, the answer is yes. I

03:50.978 --> 03:59.607
had spent a lot of time in Texas, though, during the 
five years of Continental when we were involved in

03:50.978 --> 03:59.607
the pharmaceutical program. So you knew what the 
atmosphere was like business-wise? Yeah, but of

04:02.631 --> 04:04.853
course Houston's so different than the rest of the 
state. It's probably, I would say that probably

04:05.114 --> 04:13.904
Houston is more like Chicago than College Station 
is like Houston. Oh, yeah. both in outlook and in

04:15.755 --> 04:18.297
geography. So when you came, had the funding 
already been established? No, the funding was not

04:23.302 --> 04:24.844
established then. In fact, I came here, my first 
day was September 13, 1982, and the Board of

04:26.205 --> 04:40.879
Regents hadn't even approved invent at that time, 
much to my surprise. I was going to say, that's a

04:41.460 --> 04:44.563
pretty big risk. Well, I didn't realize I was 
taking a risk until I got here.

04:50.091 --> 04:52.433
So, were you involved in trying to help get them? 
Well, no, Jean Armstrong, well, Skip handled the

04:52.694 --> 05:03.786
presentations of the Board of Regents, and to the 
extent that I gave Skip supporting material, yes,

04:52.694 --> 05:03.786
I did help. But I'm really a neophyte in dealing 
with the political, political things, as opposed

05:03.806 --> 05:14.517
to company political things. Jane

05:15.458 --> 05:23.745
Armstrong has my undying gratitude for having 
handled it as well as she did. How did you plunge

05:23.765 --> 05:28.209
into this? Because there was nothing in 
existence. Well, yeah, but see, the thing is that

05:30.451 --> 05:38.638
when I got here, I knew what I was going to do. In 
fact,

05:38.678 --> 05:45.364
do you know anything about the hiring procedure 
they used here? Okay. It was a

05:46.561 --> 05:54.752
procedure where, first of all, they ran the Adam 
Wall Street Journal. They got 125 replies to it.

05:57.676 --> 06:01.041
Then they winnowed it down to, I guess, about 10. 
And they had those 10, or whatever number it was,

06:01.942 --> 06:14.018
about 10, come down to the campus and

06:01.942 --> 06:14.018
have some preliminary interviews. Then they 
winnowed that down to three, and they set up a thing

06:14.757 --> 06:21.047
that I call the shootout at the A&M Corral. In 
industry, when you're being interviewed for a

06:22.549 --> 06:29.299
job, it's kept fairly hush-hush, and you never 
know who the other people are. Here, they want

06:29.640 --> 06:34.607
everybody to stand up in front of God and everybody 
and give their idea of how they're going to run and

06:29.640 --> 06:34.607
vent. And

06:34.687 --> 06:41.878
so they had invited the three finalists, to meet 
with faculty, graduate students, honored guests

06:42.331 --> 06:54.149
like Kosmetsky and Vick Arnold and those people, 
and say, what did you do if you were running an

06:42.331 --> 06:54.149
event? This was a new and strange... Did they give 
you warning before? Oh yeah, they gave me adequate

06:56.853 --> 07:00.178
warning. It was just that I'd never... Apparently 
in academia this is fairly common, but it isn't in

07:01.580 --> 07:05.166
business. And I'll never forget, I had I had been 
visiting my daughter in Spain and I got, well first

07:11.390 --> 07:31.776
of all I had a hard time sleeping my last night 
because I was driving back from Cordoba to Madrid

07:11.390 --> 07:31.776
and I stopped in Toledo and had a big dinner and lots 
of coffee and I had trouble falling asleep. I

07:31.916 --> 07:34.680
finally got a couple of hours of sleep and I woke up 
at about six in the morning, and I had to drop to

07:35.470 --> 07:38.573
Madrid. Well, six in the morning there is like, I 
guess, one in the morning in New York. And drove to

07:42.657 --> 07:52.768
Madrid, got on the plane, flew to New York, stood 
around for three hours in customs, then spent

07:42.657 --> 07:52.768
another two hours getting up to Connecticut. Got 
home, sat and chatted with my wife for a while.

07:55.290 --> 07:56.592
About midnight New York time. I said, now I've been 
awake for 23 hours. The phone rings, and it's Bill

07:58.714 --> 08:00.035
Mules. And he describes what's going to happen. I 
said, Bill, you've got to be kidding me. But,

08:03.179 --> 08:12.852
no, what I did then, after I thought about it for a 
bit, I figured, well, you know, it's an honest

08:03.179 --> 08:12.852
request. And while the procedure is different 
than anything I've ever experienced before, I

08:13.533 --> 08:20.563
certainly could respond to it. And what I did was 
basically lay out a presentation, which I'm

08:20.623 --> 08:29.355
almost still using today, explaining what Invent 
does. And obviously there have been some changes,

08:30.095 --> 08:35.082
but in principle it's been pretty constant. Could 
you go through that again? I can give you a copy of

08:39.108 --> 08:41.631
the presentation. Basically it says that we're 
going to use faculty and students on a part-time

08:43.113 --> 08:47.600
basis. We're going to organize using two faculty 
members who will be associate directors. And they

08:55.610 --> 09:03.500
will be responsible for coordinating with the 
faculty and students so that the faculty, that

08:55.610 --> 09:03.500
they're trying to get to work for us, view them as 
faculty rather than staff. In fact, it was kind of

09:04.742 --> 09:08.827
interesting. On my first interview, Skip Porter, 
about 10 o'clock at night, asked me what I thought

09:08.907 --> 09:20.723
it would cost to run an event. And I said, well, gee, 
I really don't know. He said, well, we've got

09:24.595 --> 09:27.239
another interview at 11 o'clock in the morning. 
You and I. Be prepared to tell me at that time. I

09:31.544 --> 09:34.008
thought, well, okay. And about 3 o'clock in the 
morning, I woke up and I thought, well, all right,

09:34.028 --> 09:38.454
you know, you can make some assumptions. You've 
been doing this work for years, looking at new

09:38.474 --> 09:41.458
ideas. And so I figured, well, all right. First of 
all, we'll probably have two or three passes at

09:46.066 --> 09:52.934
every idea before we decide whether to go with it or 
not. Generally, you get somewhere between two and

09:54.436 --> 10:00.484
five percent survival rate of the ideas, 
depending on how good they are when they come in.

10:02.166 --> 10:12.158
And so I worked out a process that would call for 
repeated screenings with increasing

10:02.166 --> 10:12.158
involvement, so that the first screening would 
get rid of the trash Second screening would

10:12.661 --> 10:15.284
acquire information. The third screening would 
define what it is we had to do and what the cost would

10:15.304 --> 10:19.348
be. And then the fourth thing that we did was to 
actually implement the plan. I laid all that out,

10:22.271 --> 10:31.401
figured a build-up curve, and came out within, oh, 
I don't know, 10% of what Skip's estimate was on the

10:22.271 --> 10:31.401
dollars. And I guess he sort of liked that, that he 
had at least somebody that agreed in spirit with

10:31.682 --> 10:42.313
this. That process was, again, something I'd been 
following more or less unconsciously in the work I

10:42.817 --> 10:51.748
was doing in Continental, because I saw thousands 
of ideas there. And I figured, well, if we're going

10:52.829 --> 10:57.875
to institutionalize this thing, i.e. have other 
people involved with it, we have to give them some

10:58.416 --> 11:05.925
idea of what the standards are and what the 
procedures are and that sort of thing. And we're

11:05.945 --> 11:08.588
still using, in fact, we've got, That procedure is 
pretty well locked in now, so we refer to a Stage 1

11:09.158 --> 11:14.565
project or Stage 2, Stage 3, Stage 4. And also, 
we're coming fairly close on the percentages, so

11:15.767 --> 11:27.622
that the original estimate I made two years ago as 
to what would survive to go from Stage 1 to Stage 2 to

11:15.767 --> 11:27.622
Stage 3 has proven pretty accurate. We make no 
attempt to force it and say, well, you've got to

11:27.642 --> 11:31.347
eliminate 90%. It's just, okay, get rid of the 
garbage on the first pass. And it turns out it's

11:34.912 --> 11:38.997
about 90%, give or take. And then the idea that we 
would be active consultants, that we would fill in

11:40.411 --> 11:55.386
the gaps in the entrepreneur's ability to put 
together a business and supply the intellectual

11:40.411 --> 11:55.386
resources. And then also the fact that we would 
share in the rewards and share in the risks. So all

11:59.150 --> 12:02.253
that was pretty much locked in two years ago. And it 
turns out, you know, Jane Armstrong, in putting

12:02.413 --> 12:09.540
together the philosophy, had come up with about 
the same thing. The whole thing has been beautiful

12:11.140 --> 12:20.512
in that there's been a great deal of agreement 
between myself and Skip and Jane and Harry

12:11.140 --> 12:20.512
Whitmore and Bill Muse and Bill Mobley and what 
have you. It's everybody moving in the same

12:21.534 --> 12:23.356
direction. And the support I've gotten from those 
people has just been fabulous. Just fabulous. Are

12:28.763 --> 12:32.187
Bill Muse and Mobley the vice? Bill Muse is vice 
chancellor now, and he was one of the founders of

12:32.207 --> 12:36.473
the event, one of the Theoreticians, I guess. Bill 
Mobley is Dean of Business, and he and Bill are both

12:38.975 --> 12:46.764
on the Invent Board of Advisors. We have what 
amounts to a Board of Directors. The Board of

12:49.868 --> 13:03.844
Directors consists of Bill Mews, Bill Mobley, 
Jack Kilby, who is an outside consultant, and also

12:49.868 --> 13:03.844
the fellow that invented the integrated circuit 
that makes all computers possible today, Skip,

12:49.868 --> 13:03.844
and Jane Armstrong. You said you wanted two 
faculty to act as liaisons? Yeah. Who are those?

13:10.145 --> 13:13.369
Don Russell from electrical engineering and Ella 
Van Fleet from business. And has that helped out

13:15.571 --> 13:20.737
from what you see in terms of establishing 
relationships? Oh, that's the only way to do it.

13:23.500 --> 13:30.648
First of all, they know all the people well, and 
they also have an internal evaluation of these

13:23.500 --> 13:30.648
folks. And it would be impossible for me to do the 
job coming in from the outside, not knowing

13:34.604 --> 13:36.967
anybody. Just a learning curve would take 10 
years. And they've already experienced all that,

13:39.770 --> 13:44.155
and they're working with people that are in their 
field. So they've got a real close-up evaluation.

13:47.699 --> 13:49.100
And it's worked out quite well. In terms of getting 
the people with the ideas and the new inventions

13:50.202 --> 13:57.470
in, how did you go about doing that? Well, again, 
I've been doing this for about 12 years, and my

13:59.815 --> 14:08.166
experience has been, and it's been proven again 
here, getting the people in is not a problem. It's

14:08.186 --> 14:13.293
keeping the door closed enough so they don't get 
overwhelmed by it. As soon as the word gets around,

14:13.833 --> 14:18.680
you're deluged. And we've had a great deal of 
publicity around the state, and every time that an

14:18.700 --> 14:29.434
article comes out in some local paper or there's a 
TV spot or something, it's like a dam break. So

14:31.102 --> 14:34.886
getting ideas in is not a problem. Getting good 
ideas is a problem. But that's true no matter where

14:36.988 --> 14:38.750
you are. First of all, inventors are very 
persistent people. Secondly, there are a great

14:42.553 --> 14:48.900
deal, a great number of people out there that fancy 
themselves as being inventors. They're really

14:49.340 --> 14:50.722
conceptualists. They get an idea and they think 
that's the end of it. Now somebody should write

14:53.584 --> 14:56.147
them a check and take care of it. And Edison said 
that invention is 5% inspiration and 95%

14:56.532 --> 15:02.099
perspiration. Well, we provide the perspiration 
here. However, having a good idea isn't enough.

15:12.471 --> 15:16.116
You've got to want to be the one that 
commercializes it. And there are very few ideas

15:17.678 --> 15:26.168
that we would consider really making a strong 
investment in that that don't include the active

15:26.519 --> 15:31.605
participation of the inventor, i.e. the inventor 
wants to start a business. And he wants to start the

15:34.348 --> 15:37.191
business with this product. And he's got some 
ideas for other products, and he's qualified for

15:37.211 --> 15:40.695
the business. And if we can find that, then we get 
much more excited about even a mediocre product

15:40.855 --> 15:53.269
idea than we do about a superb product idea where 
the guy walks in and says, yeah, OK, now you take

15:40.855 --> 15:53.269
care of it. Because one of the most important 
ingredients of any business success is a thing

15:54.599 --> 16:02.688
called the champion. And somewhere you have to 
have a champion. This is a guy whose entire life is

16:05.391 --> 16:10.457
dedicated to making this thing a success. You 
can't find champions on staff unless somebody

16:12.780 --> 16:23.492
suddenly metamorphizes into it. And

16:24.063 --> 16:29.669
occasionally it does happen, but very 
infrequently. Occasionally you'll have

16:30.030 --> 16:38.519
somebody walk in from outside that says, hey, 
look, I run this business and that business on

16:30.030 --> 16:38.519
board, and I want to start a new one. If you have 
anything, get in touch. That happens

16:41.202 --> 16:43.284
occasionally.

16:44.806 --> 16:47.148
But the champion, you know, it's a big world out 
there. There are a lot of forces that work to keep it

16:47.228 --> 16:51.153
in the status quo thing. When you come in with 
something new, you're changing the status quo.

16:54.134 --> 17:06.793
And this means that you've got to have somebody 
that is willing to dedicate a very, very

16:54.134 --> 17:06.793
significant portion of their waking hours, their 
energies, and their attention. And that's what

17:06.813 --> 17:08.415
we'd like to see. And we do have people like that. 
The people with the combination? Yeah, we do have

17:12.261 --> 17:15.225
people like that. Not on our staff, but people 
coming in. And those are the ones that really turn

17:16.907 --> 17:18.690
us on. Now, do you work to try and get the people who 
come in on the street and say, I started this

17:19.261 --> 17:26.211
business, this business, do you try and get them 
together with the others that don't? Where it's

17:26.231 --> 17:29.476
appropriate, we will, yeah.

17:30.818 --> 17:39.952
And in fact, we just sent a team up to Dallas with 
some concepts looking for manufacturers that

17:30.818 --> 17:39.952
might be interested in picking up new products. So 
we sort of took the things that we felt were not

17:39.972 --> 17:45.420
significant enough to create a business of their 
own around. but where somebody that's in a light

17:46.025 --> 17:50.350
business might be interested in licensing it. But 
this usually doesn't work very well. This was sort

17:51.812 --> 17:58.040
of a last gasp before discarding the things. And we 
find that we get things that are, yeah, they're

17:58.060 --> 18:00.783
good ideas. And if somebody's in that business, 
then maybe they can just pop it in as another

18:00.823 --> 18:07.712
product and pay the inventor $100 or something 
like that. It might help their business, and it

18:07.952 --> 18:14.901
might stimulate some economic activity, which is 
what we're supposed to be doing.

18:16.180 --> 18:25.389
And those things that are, we call them trivial, if 
we can package those and find somebody that wants a

18:16.180 --> 18:25.389
few new products. And they're usually anomaly 
items of one sort or another. Now, we do have one. In

18:30.995 --> 18:33.658
fact, it was the first business that we started. 
It's a board game called Aggie Days. And it's sort

18:37.242 --> 18:40.325
of a monopoly game. Not quite, but it uses squares 
and you move things. And all the squares, well, I

18:45.205 --> 18:52.998
don't know if it's in the stores yet, are related to 
Texas A&M. And we see the market as being the

18:53.018 --> 19:02.754
students, but more likely the parents of students 
and the former students. Yeah, somebody to give it

19:02.774 --> 19:06.661
to the kids for Christmas and that sort of thing. 
And then the former students who want a little trip

19:06.721 --> 19:11.449
and nostalgia. This was brought to us by a student, 
a guy named John Ward. And John has already started

19:16.307 --> 19:19.432
several businesses. He's got a flying school. And 
he had developed a knee pad for aviators for

19:21.795 --> 19:27.063
keeping notes. And he sold some 2,000 of those. And 
we thought the board game had some very

19:30.748 --> 19:40.823
interesting aspects to it, as did John Ward 
himself. John is a real driver. And we felt that,

19:42.817 --> 19:51.027
number one, he probably was going to go ahead and do 
the business whether we were involved or not. So

19:51.187 --> 19:52.869
he'd be better off if we were involved. Secondly, 
where he would run out of steam, we thought, was in

19:53.350 --> 20:01.179
picking up what he learned and then proliferating 
it to other campuses. And so we're putting

20:02.401 --> 20:12.553
together a strategy for him, watching what's 
happening here and then identifying target

20:02.401 --> 20:12.553
campuses for the next move and a methodology or 
handling it on other campuses. So like the UT board

20:15.459 --> 20:18.202
game? Yeah, right. And of course, this would be 
probably most successful on those campuses with a

20:18.482 --> 20:24.328
high degree of nostalgia. Somehow, I think the 
Chicago campus of the University of Illinois

20:25.709 --> 20:33.197
would not attract too many old alums. But OU and UT? 
Yeah, yeah. And certainly, if it's not a success

20:37.161 --> 20:41.545
here, there's no chance it's going to be a success 
any place. But John was up and running about a month

20:42.385 --> 20:57.401
ago, and he, one of the things he was going to have 
was to sell advertising space on the game board,

20:42.385 --> 20:57.401
and apparently he's already got $6,000 in 
advertising revenues out of some of the local

20:42.385 --> 20:57.401
businesses. And these are all nostalgia type 
places around here, so. We looked to that one to be a

21:04.488 --> 21:08.592
small, but a successful business. And then the 
second one, that I consider done, it's actually

21:11.528 --> 21:23.649
moving into its final stages of financing now, is a 
local businessman who had been producing some

21:11.528 --> 21:23.649
power packs for photo flash units. Yeah, and he 
came to us and asked for some help, so we're giving

21:25.592 --> 21:31.482
it to him. Now he's, as I say, in the final stages of 
signing the contract for the financing, and he'll

21:31.502 --> 21:37.232
be off and running. did some in-depth market 
surveys for them, and they got some strategies,

21:37.735 --> 21:48.651
and helped them negotiate with the sources of 
capital so they wouldn't take too much of the

21:37.735 --> 21:48.651
business away from them. I look to that one as being 
a success too. Again, this is connected to a guy

21:52.377 --> 22:02.973
that's already in business, starting a new 
business, and with a great deal of drive and

21:52.377 --> 22:02.973
creativity. So those are the ones that will have 
the highest probability of success. How does

22:10.045 --> 22:21.900
this, being in a public university, how does it 
differ from organizations that do the same type of

22:10.045 --> 22:21.900
thing privately? Well, I think first of all, we're 
not in it for the money. We do take a piece of the

22:25.745 --> 22:35.097
action, and this means that if the business is an 
outstanding success, we're making an

22:25.745 --> 22:35.097
outstanding amount of money in our investment. We 
don't take any money upfront though, nor do we take

22:35.853 --> 22:41.382
any debt of any sort. So, the things that do it, 
first of all, there's quote, invention marketing

22:42.424 --> 22:50.076
companies.

22:55.585 --> 23:01.995
My experience in viewing their reports has been 
that they use good paper and they have maybe one or

23:02.735 --> 23:08.725
two pages that are germane to that particular 
product, and a lot of boilerplate. And they charge

23:09.887 --> 23:13.554
$1,500 to $1,800 for that. They usually propose 
then that they will, for another $3,000 or $4,000,

23:15.377 --> 23:25.454
they will expose this invention to 500 
manufacturers and that sort of thing. Generally,

23:25.474 --> 23:27.578
the people have, that have used those services has 
come to us after the first report, and they're very

23:27.980 --> 23:36.689
dissatisfied with what they spent their money on.

23:39.912 --> 23:47.881
There are commercial venture capital companies, 
but we get involved before a venture capital

23:39.912 --> 23:47.881
company would be interested. In fact, our output 
is something that the venture capital company

23:47.901 --> 23:55.168
would need in order to decide whether or not to make 
an investment. Also, we don't take the same

23:57.038 --> 24:02.025
proportion of the business that the venture 
capital company would demand. We're also able to

24:02.886 --> 24:16.967
take things that are smaller and that never will be 
astoundingly large, because our main goal is the

24:02.886 --> 24:16.967
creation of businesses, not making a lot of money 
for our investors. So we take higher risk things.

24:19.831 --> 24:25.459
We take things that probably would not have 
another avenue.

24:27.751 --> 24:41.003
And we take things that probably will never be very 
large, or that can never be very large, simply

24:27.751 --> 24:41.003
because the market may not be all that big. But we'd 
like to see something that, if we had a rule of

24:41.023 --> 24:50.512
thumb, we'd say, well, maybe in five years they'll 
do $5 million in sales. Venture capital companies

24:50.952 --> 24:54.215
would like to see them do $100 million in five 
years. And they'll screen out anything that

24:54.235 --> 24:56.577
doesn't have that potential, at least, realizing 
that the potential is very seldom met, and that's

24:56.860 --> 25:03.367
where their risk comes in. But venture capital 
companies are in it for the buck, as are their

25:03.387 --> 25:19.784
investors, and they tend to

25:03.387 --> 25:19.784
place more of their money as growth capital for 
businesses that are always running. So you may

25:20.945 --> 25:25.770
have a company that is now in the upswing of its 
growth curve, and needs some money to finance its

25:26.898 --> 25:29.820
growth. It's run out of bankable loans and isn't 
quite positioned yet to sell its stock publicly.

25:41.050 --> 25:43.412
So venture capitalists will help out there. And 
that's where the venture capitalists are making a

25:43.432 --> 25:45.614
lot of their investments. We don't even get 
involved with that. So that's, I guess, how we

25:50.117 --> 25:51.619
differ. Also, we have the faculty available to us 
But there are other companies, other venture

25:58.049 --> 26:10.444
capital companies that use nearby universities 
as sources of talent, and they hire the professors

25:58.049 --> 26:10.444
on a consultant basis. And they may actually have 
an easier job than we do, because we can't pay a

26:11.405 --> 26:21.077
professor to work overtime for us, because we've 
got state funds. He's already working 100% for the

26:21.097 --> 26:26.063
state, so he can't have him working 110% for the 
state. And what we do... is

26:27.125 --> 26:31.832
provide release time for teaching. So, we say, 
well, fine, we'll pay a third of your salary and you

26:32.032 --> 26:38.181
only have to teach two-thirds of the classes. 
Generally, that last third doesn't really

26:38.802 --> 26:48.155
require that much more work because he's teaching 
the same class a third time, that's all. And so, our

26:48.175 --> 26:50.398
providing a third of his salary in exchange for him 
working for us thirteen hours a week isn't all that

26:50.682 --> 26:57.813
attractive, and so we have some problems getting 
faculty members there. What about publications?

26:59.576 --> 27:02.099
And of course, that's a big problem. That's a big 
problem. So far, there's been one publication

27:03.441 --> 27:08.088
that has come out of people working for a guy.

27:10.252 --> 27:11.454
What was it? It had to do with industrial 
marketing, a project we're working on with a water

27:11.474 --> 27:18.985
cleanup

27:20.737 --> 27:28.085
This will be running in a magazine called 
Industrial Marketing this summer by Al Bush and

27:20.737 --> 27:28.085
George Lucas.

27:31.168 --> 27:36.834
But generally, we don't do the kind of work that you 
could consider research. We're trying to build

27:36.914 --> 27:38.756
something and make it work. We're not trying to 
discover any new principles.

27:44.962 --> 27:50.608
The market research that we do is, I think, very 
interesting to the participants. I know they're

27:51.382 --> 27:56.430
having a ball because they're getting out in the 
real world and seeing how it is.

27:59.335 --> 28:05.565
I think that from that standpoint, they're 
learning an awful lot, but again, that doesn't

27:59.335 --> 28:05.565
come to a publication. I talked to Pustay in the 
business, and he said that part of the way they're

28:05.585 --> 28:15.702
trying to handle it is getting more towards a 
graduate program. Yeah, well, they would invent a

28:17.065 --> 28:26.695
couple of other projects they're having trouble 
with that aren't what he calls a win-win situation

28:17.065 --> 28:26.695
for them. Yeah. And have you found a good record 
with using graduate students? Yeah. In fact, this

28:33.523 --> 28:42.432
game business was done entirely by graduate 
students, and it amazed me because After they had

28:43.458 --> 28:47.203
done the first two phases of evaluation, they 
said, do you want to go ahead with it? I said, sure,

28:47.223 --> 28:51.109
go ahead, do phase three, which is lay out the plan, 
tell me what you're going to do. Well, what they did

28:51.169 --> 28:52.731
was go ahead and did it. And the next time they 
touched base with me, the business plan had been

28:53.492 --> 28:58.800
completed, and the business was ready to get 
started. And I thought, you know, there should be

28:58.920 --> 29:03.226
more people like that here. But we're using

29:03.867 --> 29:09.596
more graduate student time now than faculty time. 
And ideally... I think we should fall back to a

29:11.487 --> 29:20.781
position where the faculty provides supervision 
and advice and doesn't do any of the actual work.

29:22.544 --> 29:37.546
Trouble is that, again, it's simply a matter of 
years and presumably the faculty has more

29:22.544 --> 29:37.546
experience than the graduate students and 
they're able to interpret better what they're

29:22.544 --> 29:37.546
hearing than the graduate students. Graduate 
students will take things And the faculty

29:39.500 --> 29:46.031
members, particularly as they've been out in 
business, have seen a couple of things like this

29:39.500 --> 29:46.031
before, and they weren't quite what they seemed to 
be. So they can put some English on what they're

29:46.592 --> 29:51.019
hearing.

29:51.760 --> 29:59.132
I haven't talked to

29:51.760 --> 29:59.132
anyone in the engineering department about the 
event. Are you having similar problems with

29:59.152 --> 30:01.616
engineering in terms of the publication? I think 
it's a greater problem with engineering than with

30:01.656 --> 30:05.102
business.

30:07.816 --> 30:10.699
They're testing for you, essentially, right? 
Well, no, they're analyzing neurons. We've got a

30:13.782 --> 30:27.896
rather heavy development program in one plastic 
device, and we've got a faculty member working

30:13.782 --> 30:27.896
half-time all year round on that particular 
project. But I would say that we have more problems

30:28.897 --> 30:36.945
in engineering, simply because in engineering, 
most engineers can sell all their available

30:37.972 --> 30:42.498
consulting time. And if they're going to take time 
out from publications and teaching, they can get

30:42.518 --> 30:55.196
paid more, and it's extra money in their pocket, by 
just picking up a consulting contract and working

30:42.518 --> 30:55.196
on that. And they get in six days what we'll pay them 
in the semester for working part-time for us. Are

31:02.466 --> 31:05.851
these problems things that you realize you would 
run up against? No, no. Because it's a totally

31:06.833 --> 31:07.894
different world. That part of it, yeah. I would say

31:10.183 --> 31:23.776
to some extent, too, I'm maybe a little surprised 
by how self-centered some of the faculty appears

31:10.183 --> 31:23.776
to be at times. And maybe I shouldn't be. Somehow I

31:26.578 --> 31:36.868
thought that in an educational institution that 
there would be a maybe more charity, and I find out

31:37.220 --> 31:43.909
it's maybe the same or maybe less than you find it in 
business. But everybody's the same? Well, I guess

31:45.431 --> 31:47.533
that's what it amounts to, right. Who do you deal 
with in the university system? Do you deal with

31:54.683 --> 31:56.866
anyone outside of teams? Well, the College of 
Business, yeah, and rather extensively there. We

32:03.832 --> 32:09.903
do have some dealings with the School of Medicine. 
We have initiated some dealings with UT

32:10.043 --> 32:22.385
Arlington, HARC, and we're trying to set up a 
project at UT Austin. And since we are a state

32:22.405 --> 32:25.030
organization,

32:26.663 --> 32:28.585
perfectly justified in doing that. In fact, it's 
recommended that we do. Now, this is one

32:31.068 --> 32:38.377
particular project you're working on, or a 
totally separate, affiliated in-vent project?

32:38.397 --> 32:54.156
Well, it would be an individual project that would 
be worked on there rather than here, mainly

32:38.397 --> 32:54.156
because the inventor's in Austin, and UT Austin 
has some people that are particularly talented in

32:38.397 --> 32:54.156
this particular field. and it would just make a 
great deal of sense to do it out there. And that's in

32:58.525 --> 33:04.893
the process of it, so.

33:04.913 --> 33:12.703
Now, were you involved at all in the setting up of 
the UTR and the T-Center, or did you take advantage

33:04.913 --> 33:12.703
of most of the center? You're talking about the 
Small Business Development Company Center,

33:12.883 --> 33:19.812
SBDC, Small Business Development Center. To the 
extent that I met with John Rouse up there and told

33:19.832 --> 33:23.957
him what we were doing here, and

33:25.675 --> 33:35.144
had some preliminary discussions with some of his 
people, offered our services. Occasionally he

33:35.865 --> 33:42.431
sends somebody down here to talk to us, and he 
thinks that they need our help more than his, and

33:35.865 --> 33:42.431
that sort of thing. And I send people up there when I 
think that they need his help more than ours. So

33:47.416 --> 33:50.839
from that standpoint, I was not directly involved 
in setting it up. Harry Whitmore, I guess, had

33:51.379 --> 33:53.001
handled that. Harry had skipped it in there. to the 
extent that there was a transfer of information,

33:55.240 --> 34:00.685
yeah, it wasn't local. Could he deal with

34:00.705 --> 34:06.991
inside the system? Inside the A&M system? Yeah. 
All right. Inside the A&M system, again, it's

34:10.454 --> 34:23.847
College of Business, TEAS, any other college dean 
that we need. Bill

34:24.738 --> 34:38.792
Mews, Mark Money, I

34:24.738 --> 34:38.792
guess indirectly through Perry Atkinson.

34:42.376 --> 34:49.783
I've had some dealings with agriculture with the 
Ag Experiment Station.

34:51.772 --> 34:52.633
Other than that, no. It's mostly business and 
engineering. Outside, too, by the way, the

34:57.477 --> 35:03.422
sources of capital, venture capitalists, that 
sort of commercial world. You do try and get them

35:03.442 --> 35:07.766
together with the capital. Yeah, when it's 
advisable. Once you've gotten past that stage.

35:10.788 --> 35:14.071
Yeah, right now, we don't have anything big enough 
to go to venture capital with. We've used local

35:16.333 --> 35:19.596
financing on that. But when you get up toward the 
million mark, and you really get your act put

35:21.792 --> 35:25.035
together, then you can go and watch a cat bus. But 
you have helped them get together with local

35:26.557 --> 35:28.759
planners? Yeah. What do you do as, you know, you've 
got whole organizations that I put, do you as

35:32.742 --> 35:41.771
director of this, of this invent, what stages do 
you get into? I don't know, inspire a lead, put out

35:41.791 --> 35:43.192
fires. I see my role as being the interface with the 
outside. and a policy role, and a supervisory role

35:52.235 --> 36:03.155
over procedures, and particularly the stage four 
programs. And for instance, right now I'm missing

36:04.297 --> 36:13.433
our Wednesday morning staff meeting, which is not 
a staff meeting per se, but it's a stage four review

36:04.297 --> 36:13.433
meeting. Now, what we do is when a program gets to 
this implementation stage where we're actually

36:14.105 --> 36:26.664
doing product development and actually running 
the business part and actually sending out market

36:14.105 --> 36:26.664
researchers, we appoint a faculty member as team 
leader. And he basically puts together a little

36:26.684 --> 36:29.088
company. He's got some marketing people, and he's 
got some finance people, and he's got some

36:29.869 --> 36:34.336
engineering people. He's got some strategy 
people. He may play several of these roles

36:36.519 --> 36:38.502
himself. But whatever he needs, we try to get for 
him in the way of talent. It's his job, then, to try

36:44.092 --> 36:58.875
to keep the thing on track, try to hit the schedule 
objectives, milestones, and bring the program

36:44.092 --> 36:58.875
in. So once a week, we spend a half hour per program 
in which he reports what's going on, what his

36:58.895 --> 37:08.269
problems are, what help he needs. And this meeting 
is just the team leader, the two associate

37:09.130 --> 37:12.816
directors, and myself. And we've set up a 
procedure where when the half hour is up, that's

37:14.315 --> 37:19.561
the end of that meter. If we have to meet more on 
that, we reschedule that particular month. This

37:25.409 --> 37:31.696
way, you don't wind up with some projects being 
cheated and others getting too much attention.

37:34.760 --> 37:38.725
I meet with the inventors frequently. And I like to 
get involved myself with them. Oh, particularly

37:42.682 --> 37:46.087
ones in which I feel particularly competent. 
Power generation, thermodynamics, things that I

37:46.748 --> 37:53.939
may have been involved in in the past. In industry, 
I think I'm going to bring some insight in on these

37:53.959 --> 37:57.925
things. So I like to get my hands dirty on those.

38:03.553 --> 38:06.698
But to come up with a job description, that's 
difficult. I think it's difficult in the whole

38:07.437 --> 38:09.380
organization. Yeah, it really is. I think if you 
can't, that's why they have such nice titles. You

38:13.026 --> 38:14.648
know, you're vice president of sales. Everybody 
knows what that is, so you don't have to explain it

38:14.708 --> 38:18.755
to them. But I guess, you know, to the extent that 
I'm the president of the company here, reporting

38:19.376 --> 38:28.650
to my board of directors, and fairly autonomous. 
So from that standpoint, it's very satisfying.

38:31.895 --> 38:34.659
And I've been satisfied with the results. A little 
anxious that they We stopped popping things out

38:36.547 --> 38:42.813
faster, but it just took longer to get them through 
the pipeline than I thought they would. In terms of

38:43.294 --> 38:53.264
flexibility, are you as flexible

38:43.294 --> 38:53.264
here as you were in the private sector? Yes and no. I 
think that,

38:53.904 --> 38:59.029
well, let's put it this way. It's harder to do 
things. You don't have as much money available.

39:07.934 --> 39:17.304
Because people are locked into semester 
schedules that are scheduled a year and a half in

39:07.934 --> 39:17.304
advance, they're not always available. And in a 
company, it was always possible to get ahold of

39:18.765 --> 39:22.790
somebody for some length of time.

39:26.634 --> 39:29.857
I remember talking to one of my former Continental 
Group associates. And he said, what kind of

39:31.078 --> 39:33.581
funding do you have for this operation? I said, 
well, we've got a million dollars for the

39:33.601 --> 39:35.903
biennium. So that's a half million dollars a year. 
They said, Frank, that used to be your expense

39:37.837 --> 39:40.680
account.

39:45.064 --> 39:59.679
So from the standpoint of money, in the standpoint 
of being able to go outside and get help, we try very

39:45.064 --> 39:59.679
hard to use the help internally. As a result, it 
slows things down. Recently, we did have to go

40:01.721 --> 40:03.443
outside. And gee, just the procedures of getting 
an outside consultant, I get with the governor,

40:06.642 --> 40:09.765
they're okay.

40:13.269 --> 40:13.429
Amazing. I guess approval levels, yeah, there's 
also approval. We had a letter come through here

40:15.671 --> 40:32.008
the other day requesting

40:15.671 --> 40:32.008
permission for, well, AINVENT was going to fund 
the presentation of a paper in France, and this was

40:15.671 --> 40:32.008
because of some work that had been done.

40:33.710 --> 40:37.415
it turned out that it looked like it required 19 
approvals. You know, it started out with the guy

40:37.535 --> 40:54.717
requesting it, went through his assistant 
department head, his department head, went

40:37.535 --> 40:54.717
through his assistant dean, his dean, came over to 
T's, went through Skip, went through me, then was

40:37.535 --> 40:54.717
going to head on up through Vanderveer and Hanson, 
and ultimately, I don't know, through two state

40:37.535 --> 40:54.717
senators and the governor or something. I 
couldn't believe it.

41:02.246 --> 41:02.687
Do you... Well,

41:04.000 --> 41:33.501
again, I believe that any time that you can inject 
the outside world into the university

41:04.000 --> 41:33.501
environment, that you're doing everybody a 
favor. To

41:34.696 --> 42:00.265
some extent, I guess I was a little bit taken aback 
the first time I started working with the faculty,

41:34.696 --> 42:00.265
and it sort of reminded me of being out in business 
and having a brand new, eager, intelligent,

41:34.696 --> 42:00.265
hardworking MBA who is just chock full of theory, 
and doesn't even know who to call to get the right

42:01.325 --> 42:06.633
answer to something. I think that the standpoint 
that they're able to say, oh, yeah, well, I talked

42:06.653 --> 42:20.253
to 50 guys in the oil business

42:06.653 --> 42:20.253
and I think we ought to go back and hit this guy and 
that guy and this guy because they seem to know more

42:06.653 --> 42:20.253
about it. That sort of thing I think is useful. I 
think we're doing the university a fantastic

42:22.776 --> 42:29.526
service in what we're doing with the graduate 
students. We've got an MBA candidate now, first

42:30.350 --> 42:35.838
year MBA candidate, that's going to start a 
business. Not of her own, but she's doing a foreign

42:35.858 --> 42:41.446
event, getting something else started here. And I 
think that's just a marvelous experience. And

42:45.432 --> 42:55.846
what it's doing is showing them that it's not an 
impossibly difficult thing to do, and it's

42:45.432 --> 42:55.846
something they can handle. And we use graduate 
students on two bases. is the research assistant

43:00.472 --> 43:05.197
program, we just hire them. And the other is the 
intern program. And the intern program is for

43:08.660 --> 43:15.007
second year MBA students with an engineering 
undergraduate degree. And we give them three

43:16.428 --> 43:19.992
hours of credit in exchange for 10 hours a week. On 
the other hand, we will not make the same work

43:20.873 --> 43:28.861
demands that we would make of a research 
assistant. And we leave them pretty much set their

43:30.560 --> 43:49.280
own program, follow their own nose, and to try to 
absorb as much as possible about what we're doing

43:30.560 --> 43:49.280
and how we do it and how people react and that sort of 
thing.

43:50.462 --> 43:54.867
Also, they've got a right to sit in on anything they 
want to. They don't have to necessarily be

43:57.650 --> 43:59.892
assigned to it. I'd go on a trip and investigate 
another project, and we'd be fine. It's all part of

44:05.099 --> 44:07.221
the deal. That's for credit towards their degree. 
Yeah. So from that standpoint, I think that we're

44:11.606 --> 44:16.310
benefiting the university. I think eventually 
we'll do with money.

44:21.976 --> 44:24.438
Have you... Oh, there's another thing, too. A lot 
of things that, again, no matter how good an

44:24.458 --> 44:29.743
invention is, somebody's got to want to push it. 
and wear that force here. Now I have been

44:34.222 --> 44:39.387
disappointed in the number, a small number of 
university inventions we've seen. Most of our

44:40.188 --> 44:43.772
inventions come from outside or coming from 
students. And faculty members for some reason are

44:43.792 --> 44:51.460
not bringing them forward.

44:51.480 --> 44:52.941
Possibly. Possibly. I think also that Some of them 
are so esoteric that there may not be any

44:55.373 --> 45:00.240
commercial application. If

45:00.421 --> 45:07.691
you started a business and sold the world market, 
you'd sell three windows. That would be it. At a

45:10.476 --> 45:15.543
high price point.

45:16.244 --> 45:16.705
Yeah. Have you consciously made any changes in the 
direction that is going? Well,

45:25.462 --> 45:34.775
yeah, I think we sort of came full circle on the 
relative roles of graduate students and faculty.

45:34.795 --> 45:47.352
I originally started out thinking that the MBA 
candidates were going to be the most useful

45:34.795 --> 45:47.352
workers, mainly because they were aimed toward 
the commercial world and their objectives would

45:34.795 --> 45:47.352
be the same as inventors.
