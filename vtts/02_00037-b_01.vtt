WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:04.582
to be a court reporter in the Navy. I did steno mask, 
and then I would have to take that, put the

00:05.543 --> 00:12.794
earphones on and type it all up. It's a mess. Does 
she have to listen to it? Does she have earphones

00:15.899 --> 00:18.242
on? Yeah, I used to do that. I used to have these 
court marshals and You were talking about

00:22.660 --> 00:23.701
Calhoun. Oh yes, Stately. I think Stately was the 
word. But he was also very available.

00:37.340 --> 00:40.444
Did you all think A&M was making progress during 
those days? Oh, I thought it was just going. I

00:42.927 --> 00:48.955
thought I was involved in the greatest 
development of any school in history. Well, I

00:49.407 --> 00:51.390
think a lot of people felt that way. The schools up 
north were declining. This was almost a

00:55.596 --> 00:57.439
renaissance.

01:00.243 --> 01:04.430
The student body was growing in number.

01:10.219 --> 01:11.380
What about the quality? Oh, yes. I think the women 
were helping that, too. Well, very fine. Do you

01:20.752 --> 01:27.680
remember any changes in the way you all did things 
with women? Did that affect the way— No, I don't

01:28.961 --> 01:37.211
remember any problem with political correctness 
or that kind of thing. We were just natural. I think

01:40.595 --> 01:43.258
everybody was very respectful of women. What 
about minorities? Do you remember when you first

01:45.544 --> 01:48.328
had some black students? Yes, I didn't have very 
many.

01:55.356 --> 01:57.519
That was hard. I mean, I was different. Most of my 
students were typical Anglo-Saxon. I remember

02:05.108 --> 02:09.634
that we tutored the football team a couple of 
times. Describe that. Well, it was volunteer for

02:13.712 --> 02:16.938
the students. I thought if I could develop their 
vocabulary, this would help. So I built Greek and

02:21.487 --> 02:30.525
Latin roots and added suffixes and tried to make 
football stories out of it. I'm not sure that I

02:30.505 --> 02:39.933
developed many new words for them, but vocabulary 
is what I wanted. The football players were all

02:39.954 --> 02:42.396
very respectful. I had one student, I remember his 
name was Lord. Do you remember? Lord was one of our

02:45.859 --> 02:48.181
outstanding football players. He used to call me 
and say, this is the Lord speaking. But he was

02:53.366 --> 02:57.249
always being carried off the field, and I would 
groan. He won't be in class for a while now. But the

03:00.492 --> 03:09.503
students at the football tutoring were very nice, 
just like anyone else. But I'm not sure I grabbed

03:10.505 --> 03:13.989
them with vocabulary. Did, in your doing that, did 
the athletic department ask for, did anyone from

03:14.550 --> 03:25.083
athletics ever ask you to give special treatment 
to any student? No one ever did. And they did when I

03:27.246 --> 03:29.689
was at Lycoming College. But no one ever did, and 
they would come around and see if they needed any

03:30.563 --> 03:39.411
help with them or if they were attending class. It 
was all very professional. In all of your years

03:45.457 --> 03:58.950
here, did anyone in authority, real or 
self-appointed authority, ever try to influence

03:45.457 --> 03:58.950
the grade you gave anyone? No. No politician, no 
board member, no Rich Aggie? No, I can't think of

04:05.858 --> 04:10.002
any problem with that at all. Now, when I was at 
Brooklyn College, I remember students saying if I

04:10.923 --> 04:19.711
didn't give them an A, they would go to Vietnam, 
things like that. But I'm sure that there were

04:21.772 --> 04:27.958
incidents where they didn't agree with my grade. I 
don't recall any outside pressure. By the end of

04:31.287 --> 04:35.517
the 70s, were you still teaching primarily 
undergraduate courses? By the end of the 70s,

04:35.537 --> 04:39.827
almost all graduate courses. Describe how that's 
different. Well, it's much easier in a way. The

04:45.441 --> 04:47.365
classes are smaller. I didn't have any of these 
ninety classes. I didn't like a small class

04:53.347 --> 04:54.992
either. If it was under twelve, that was too small. 
But the classes were smaller. But of course, most

05:03.275 --> 05:12.873
of my graduate classes were three hours, so I 
needed to develop different techniques for

05:03.275 --> 05:12.873
changing the pace. They would meet once a week for 
three hours. The summer session they would meet

05:16.440 --> 05:24.996
three hours every day, which put a little pressure 
on, but it was they were learning. Three hours once

05:27.735 --> 05:33.052
a week, you have to spend a while warming them up 
each time. But that was the difference. length of

05:37.480 --> 05:42.326
the class, but the students were a smaller number 
of students. These, by and large, were students

05:43.107 --> 05:48.554
already had an undergraduate degree in what? All 
different fields, from physics to English. They

05:51.699 --> 06:04.315
were all different fields, and many of them had 
been teaching for a few years, and the master's

05:51.699 --> 06:04.315
degree would help them salary-wise and 
professionally. So this was not primarily for

06:04.295 --> 06:08.212
them to be certified. They already were 
certified. No, no. Most of this. I think that, if

06:10.622 --> 06:12.972
I'm not mistaken, Most of them were certified. 
They could take it without certification. And

06:19.069 --> 06:20.772
geographically they were from? All over. I had 
some students traveling from San Antonio. But

06:24.978 --> 06:26.740
they were basically from Texas? Oh, yes. Yes, 
there were. Well, I've had some students from

06:30.265 --> 06:39.718
other states, but I think they were here 
permanently for the More

06:39.698 --> 06:43.865
women than men. More women than men. Almost no 
international students.

06:50.476 --> 06:55.846
You know, I had international students from 
Afghanistan, China. Would this have been true in

06:56.607 --> 06:58.450
the early 80s? Yes. I had many foreign students, 
and I still have trophies around the house where

07:01.137 --> 07:09.949
they gave me things. I found out later that when you 
invite them over to your home, they think they have

07:10.030 --> 07:17.680
to bring you something. I remember a student 
begging me not to invite him over anymore, and I

07:17.700 --> 07:25.872
didn't want him to give things. What were some of 
the unusual or distinctive gifts that you

07:26.206 --> 07:32.175
remember they brought? Well, I remember a tea set. 
Now this was just, I mean, and beautifully

07:34.618 --> 07:43.612
lacquered and things of that sort. And then wall 
hangings and some of those scroll paintings from

07:43.632 --> 07:48.519
China. But I didn't realize until later that that 
was their custom. But yes, we, from the very

07:55.467 --> 08:03.899
beginning, had international students, many of 
them from Afghanistan, I mean, Iran. And when I

08:04.059 --> 08:15.214
taught the cultural foundation, which was a 
master's level course, it was interesting that so

08:04.059 --> 08:15.214
many of these Muslim women felt sorry for American 
women. And I assume it was because American women

08:15.751 --> 08:19.235
had to work. But our vision of these Muslim women is 
that they're terribly

08:20.256 --> 08:29.906
handicapped as far as freedom is concerned. They 
didn't seem to worry about it. Well, that was the

08:31.788 --> 08:35.492
impression I got, or they would tell me, about 
their culture. In terms of their capability, can

08:36.213 --> 08:44.762
you compare the norm for the U.S. national 
students with the norm for the international?

08:44.860 --> 08:53.652
Yes, I think quite definitely there is a 
difference, and the more oriental student was a

08:44.860 --> 08:53.652
very good memorizer. And some of these from 
Vietnam, they were very conscientious and very

08:55.435 --> 09:12.139
good memorizers, but they didn't always have the 
creative mind that some of our students had. What

09:12.159 --> 09:13.821
about their diligence? Well, I think that was all 
over on the Asian side. Although our students

09:19.588 --> 09:26.902
generally worked hard, but many of them had 
teaching and other responsibilities. Did you

09:27.684 --> 09:32.012
have any Western Hemisphere international 
students? Well, I've had some from Mexico and

09:32.650 --> 09:40.990
Venezuela. I had a very fine student from 
Venezuela. Compare those Western Hemisphere

09:44.097 --> 09:49.410
international students to the Asian. I don't 
think they were quite as good memorizers, but I

09:49.660 --> 09:56.430
don't have a big sample there. I think they were all 
good students, though. Did you have to do anything

09:59.875 --> 10:08.327
special in a graduate course that had some U.S. 
nationals and some international students?

10:09.438 --> 10:15.647
Well, with the cultural foundations of 
education, I developed cultural patterns. I was

10:15.667 --> 10:28.065
trying to teach our people what our own culture was 
as well as how to take these cultural patterns and

10:15.667 --> 10:28.065
compare them with different and learn how to 
compare and develop cultural understanding. So

10:29.767 --> 10:34.534
some of these people would share their cultural 
differences. from language all the way down to

10:34.514 --> 10:41.905
various hierarchies of values into artifacts. 
But I don't know that I can say there was a big

10:42.706 --> 10:49.896
difference there. Most of these graduate 
students, be they U.S. or international, they

10:50.978 --> 11:01.213
were how far out of undergraduate years?

11:05.581 --> 11:09.430
Well, some had been out for a long time. You're 
talking about just the international students?

11:11.775 --> 11:12.296
Well, either. Most of them had been out. I had some 
that just went from undergraduate right in, but we

11:15.563 --> 11:20.474
kind of discouraged that. I thought they should be 
teaching. Most of these had real experience. Yes,

11:24.042 --> 11:27.166
but some of them had been out for many years. I had 
one student who finally sued the university for

11:27.546 --> 11:34.535
prejudice against older people because he didn't 
pass a couple of courses. But it turns out he hadn't

11:35.296 --> 11:38.480
turned any of his work in either. But there was a 
wide range. I think the doctoral level students

11:42.445 --> 11:48.792
had had were, of course, definitely farther 
removed. But the master's level, some would go

11:48.853 --> 11:52.497
right in from the undergraduate. And those I took 
to Europe for the comparative ed course. Half of

11:57.685 --> 12:00.931
them had just finished their undergraduate. 
Describe one of those trips to Europe. I only made

12:04.536 --> 12:05.798
two. The first was 1982.

12:11.663 --> 12:14.046
We made arrangements. It's an awful lot of work to 
do, of course. I think we had about 30 or more

12:16.068 --> 12:18.551
students. We got a grant from Conoco to help defray 
the expenses. So it cost, as I recall, about $800.

12:27.402 --> 12:30.426
Most of that was just airfare in those days, $82. We 
went to London. and had arrangements to visit all

12:32.909 --> 12:38.637
levels of schools in and around London. And we went 
to Oxford and looked through the schools there.

12:43.384 --> 12:55.843
Then we went to Stirling, spent about half our time 
in Stirling, Scotland, and then moved out, took

12:43.384 --> 12:55.843
students to all levels of schools and compared 
them with American schools. In 1982, I think, the

12:57.625 --> 13:02.072
Falkland War was on and we were getting involved 
with some of the political discussions there that

13:03.419 --> 13:10.425
many of them didn't think we were doing enough to 
help England. Then I was there in 84, which was the

13:11.688 --> 13:17.798
40th anniversary of D-Day.

13:20.763 --> 13:23.127
I think Reagan was there and a few others. We didn't 
get to interview them. Do you remember any goofy

13:26.513 --> 13:30.600
things that happened on either of those trips? 
Well, there was always a problem. They thought

13:35.228 --> 13:42.397
this was more of a tour, and they wanted to see 
things, and I sympathized with that, wanted to

13:35.228 --> 13:42.397
give them as much time. We had a heart attack, an 
older woman, and she got into one of the British

13:43.699 --> 13:50.007
systems. They had a student who had a kidney stone 
attack.

13:56.636 --> 14:04.746
The medical facilities there were better, they 
thought, than over here, and they actually got

13:56.636 --> 14:04.746
time to talk to doctors. Any goofy things? Goofy.

14:11.556 --> 14:12.980
Nobody got too drunk? No. I didn't see any of that. I 
do know that the second time I took my son, who was a

14:17.269 --> 14:22.380
student at Clemson, And we shared the same room. 
After the first day, I never saw him. I was asleep

14:29.380 --> 14:31.102
before he ever got in. I'm not just sure what they 
were doing. They were out doing things. I can't

14:37.251 --> 14:38.953
recall anything really. Nobody lost their entire 
bag? We didn't have any problems of that sort. I do

14:46.441 --> 14:57.822
recall, this is not too funny, but in my cultural 
patterns would be ways of doing this, this, this,

14:46.441 --> 14:57.822
and I also had ways of courting and sex, sexual 
mores. I think one of the students went to one of the

15:02.422 --> 15:07.035
English professors at the university and asked 
about his sexual patterns.

15:10.003 --> 15:17.443
And she said, well, Dr. Campbell asked me to do 
that.

15:17.423 --> 15:20.528
By this time, you're directing theses and 
dissertations. Oh, yes. And I think I was on, one

15:21.189 --> 15:33.508
time I was on 50 when I had to start listing them 
because I would have them at the early stages and

15:21.189 --> 15:33.508
they needed to get a committee together. That was a 
big thing at our department. When did the doctoral

15:37.854 --> 15:39.978
program begin? Do you remember? Well, let's see. 
We were approved of the The Ed.D. was approved. We

15:47.709 --> 15:49.571
had the Ph.D., I think, earlier. But my memory is 
not good. It may have been in the late seventies or

15:54.916 --> 16:00.162
early eighties, but I would have to check on that.

16:04.206 --> 16:07.869
Do you remember some of the first doctoral 
students you directed? Well, Barry Thompson was

16:08.750 --> 16:11.894
on his committee. Of course, that was That was the 
Ph.D. That was about 1971 or 72. Who was his

16:13.617 --> 16:18.687
chairman? Do you remember? No. I think he started 
out with this man that I can't think of who was a

16:21.794 --> 16:27.946
colleague there of Dean Huber. But Glenn Johnson 
was on the committee, and I was asked to get in on

16:33.918 --> 16:37.783
that because somebody couldn't meet the defense. 
So I was not in on the total thing, but he became

16:37.843 --> 16:41.968
chancellor. What was he doing then? He was 
teaching. He was a very young man. He may have been

16:47.576 --> 16:53.763
down at Pan American or something of that sort, but 
this was early in the stages. But your question was

16:55.085 --> 17:00.432
who were some of the people that I had?

17:01.103 --> 17:04.170
I can't take credit for the fine things that he did. 
I'm not sure. I think his dissertation had

17:06.697 --> 17:17.222
something to do with junior colleges or some 
aspect.

17:19.396 --> 17:26.907
Of course, Miss Scobie, you know, the wife of the 
astronaut who was killed? Oh, yes, yes. She was in

17:28.048 --> 17:30.952
several of my classes.

17:38.383 --> 17:42.889
Do you remember, have any idea how many masters and 
PhDs you directed? Yes. Or doctoral degrees,

17:43.697 --> 17:45.939
either Ed.D. or Ph.D. The Ed.D. or Ph.D., I think I 
only directed about eight. But I think I was on so

17:54.290 --> 17:59.856
many as the bridesmaid. What's the difference 
really in a Ph.D. in education and an Ed.D. in

18:06.044 --> 18:06.885
education? Well, originally it was the language 
requirement. And

18:13.238 --> 18:22.258
then we replaced the language requirement with 
statistics. And I think the Ed.D. did not require

18:25.458 --> 18:27.001
statistics. We also had the M.A. and the M.E.D., 
and the M.A. required a thesis, and the M.E.D. did

18:34.831 --> 18:38.016
not, but it required some extra coursework. But 
the Ed.D. required a dissertation. Oh, yes, and

18:40.599 --> 18:43.503
there was not any difference. Really? In terms of 
future professional advantage, which was the

18:44.785 --> 18:52.195
better degree for the person to get?

18:54.824 --> 18:59.451
Well, when I was at Columbia, they said the EdD was 
better. But

19:01.114 --> 19:08.425
I always think the Ph.D. is better. It goes a longer 
tradition. That would have been my guess. Yes. But

19:13.733 --> 19:21.945
there was a time when they thought that EdD was more 
specialized. Which was, in terms of the number of

19:21.925 --> 19:29.122
students in the years that you spent here, which 
was more popular? I think the Ph.D. was still the

19:29.142 --> 19:37.622
most popular, and they would take the statistics 
rather than the foreign language. All right, you

19:37.602 --> 19:42.876
all moved over to the, did you move from the 
academic to the Harrington building? Yes.

19:43.558 --> 19:47.770
Describe where the department and the college was 
put when that moved here. Well, our department,

19:47.790 --> 19:53.485
the curriculum and instruction, I think 
originally was on the fifth floor. A few years

19:53.465 --> 19:57.171
later we were moved to the third floor. But I 
remember when we were on the fifth floor, the fire

19:57.191 --> 20:06.806
department came and I saw the chief sweating and 
mumbling to himself. He thought it was a fire trap.

20:11.633 --> 20:12.975
Then we moved to the third floor. I don't know if 
it's so we'd be safer, but that was curriculum and

20:13.015 --> 20:18.544
instruction. I think Ed Add mainly had the second 
floor, and then of course Dean Hubert and the Dean

20:18.524 --> 20:29.023
of Liberal Arts were up on the eighth floor. Now, 
who else, what other education departments were

20:29.223 --> 20:34.811
in the Harrington building? Oh, education. We had 
everything except industrial ed and PE and

20:36.714 --> 20:43.664
agriculture. Oh, and ag ed. Yeah, ag ed was not 
there. The others were there, and we also had the

20:45.967 --> 20:53.918
English department, I think, and then the history 
department was there later. I believe they stayed

20:53.998 --> 20:58.605
over at academic, didn't they, for a while, but 
they later took over the Yeah. As far as you were

21:01.093 --> 21:04.397
concerned, describe your office. Well, every 
office I had had a window, which was nice. The old

21:11.726 --> 21:13.829
academic building, I didn't have a window. 
Marvelous facilities. And of course the computer

21:18.975 --> 21:20.677
came in. I think, I can't remember exactly what it 
was, but I was going to resist it to the grave. But

21:26.885 --> 21:31.669
then they brought them in and put them in our 
office. What kind of instruction was there? Well,

21:33.831 --> 21:35.293
we didn't have very much. We did have a day or two of 
it, and it was just beyond me. I didn't take it

21:38.816 --> 21:41.058
seriously. So mainly it was self-taught, and we 
had IBM clones. But if I had had the computer from my

21:49.185 --> 21:56.892
earlier stages, I probably could have stayed 
teaching longer. I wouldn't have worn myself out.

22:00.992 --> 22:02.215
I had files. I was just climbing the walls and I was 
using the floor. But the computer was coming in in

22:07.873 --> 22:12.687
my last years. Now, prior to the computer, you had 
been typing everything? An electric typewriter.

22:18.491 --> 22:24.927
Of course, in the Navy I had been a court reporter 
and I was typing all the time. So typing was my

22:27.112 --> 22:31.502
thing. And your compensation was all from the 
university, so you didn't have many grants? I

22:39.812 --> 22:50.304
never got a grant, except this conical for the... 
And so you didn't have many graduate assistants to

22:39.812 --> 22:50.304
help you do your research? No. I made a few 
proposals, about two or three proposals, which

22:50.745 --> 22:57.473
were never granted. But my field, of course, is not 
one that attracts a lot of interest for grants like

22:58.955 --> 23:14.790
reading and other bread and butter kinds of 
courses. As you all move over into that building in

23:14.810 --> 23:21.736
the 80s, were there any key additions to the 
departmental faculty? Well, we were keenly

23:22.477 --> 23:24.518
growing. But there's a kid's story about that new 
building. which may or may not be true. But where we

23:31.743 --> 23:36.770
had the early childhood room, they had a sandbox. 
And I believe that became notorious around the

23:38.072 --> 23:47.085
university that the College of Education had 
installed a sandbox in its I don't remember ever

23:48.365 --> 23:56.340
seeing the sandbox, but we did have the early 
childhood there. There were, as I recall, a few

23:56.400 --> 24:04.635
bats that remained in the building that had been 
there in that older building. But the transition,

24:04.615 --> 24:13.189
we moved from different floors a couple of times, 
as I say, from the fifth curriculum instruction

24:04.615 --> 24:13.189
went to the third.

24:15.954 --> 24:20.241
There were adjustments in moving around, but it 
was a marvelous facility. Faculty additions,

24:21.623 --> 24:23.006
key. Who were some new colleagues?

24:28.595 --> 24:39.570
Dave Armstrong, who later became a dean of 
education in North Carolina, was one of our very

24:28.595 --> 24:39.570
fine young men. There

24:39.631 --> 24:49.985
were some, you know, my memory is lapsing. I can't 
even remember certain philosophers anymore.

24:58.514 --> 25:08.963
Oh, Donna Norton, of course, came when we were in 
the new building, and she is outstanding in

24:58.514 --> 25:08.963
children's literature. How were women faculty 
members treated in that department? I think they

25:13.550 --> 25:18.555
were treated

25:13.550 --> 25:18.555
just fine. Can I give a little anecdote? Please. 
Oh, more anecdotes than that. We had a dean. She did

25:25.822 --> 25:31.447
a nice job, but she called all the men in one time. 
This was about the time I was—this is not Dean

25:32.108 --> 25:35.651
Hubert. It's the Lady Dean. seemed to indicate 
that we were not treating women right, and we were

25:39.655 --> 25:52.888
not told what happened, and she just wanted to make 
sure that there wouldn't be none of that. There

25:52.970 --> 26:03.165
must have been some reason for her doing that, but 
it kind of turned some of us off to be called in like

25:52.970 --> 26:03.165
little boys. It turns out that I think someone had 
disagreed with a woman in a faculty meeting, and

26:03.245 --> 26:14.421
you're not supposed to disagree, I guess. But I've 
always thought everything was very good. But I

26:18.475 --> 26:23.432
opened doors for women, and I guess that was 
probably not good either. Do you remember when the

26:24.087 --> 26:29.594
first black faculty member came in? Yes. Well, of 
course, we had Vi Flores, who is now dean at New

26:32.958 --> 26:39.586
Mexico. She was Mexican-American. And she worked 
with the dean of the president, I think, Vi Flores.

26:46.855 --> 26:52.862
She was one of the first minorities, just a lovely 
person.

26:54.563 --> 26:59.689
This lady, she's still there, and her husband is in 
another department who are black. Oh gosh, I know

27:01.211 --> 27:03.955
her just as well as I can. And we have several of them 
now, and I've been on committees, one of them from

27:03.975 --> 27:07.419
Africa. Do you remember any difficulties? No. 
Good. I can't remember any problem.

27:15.630 --> 27:20.496
Now, if you were to ask some of the women, this might 
be different. I do remember one woman I can't think

27:23.453 --> 27:28.520
of her name now, but she was very good. She said she 
wanted to be sure she got the same amount of money.

27:32.565 --> 27:37.632
So it could be they were not getting the same amount 
of money, and I just didn't keep track of that. But I

27:39.355 --> 27:44.922
always thought we had mostly women students. This 
is a field where women are leaders. Did you and your

27:50.015 --> 27:55.504
colleagues feel that the college was being 
treated fairly in the 80s and 90s? I always did,

27:55.804 --> 27:56.826
yes. And I had experience at a small liberal arts 
college where most of the departments had more

27:58.669 --> 28:09.306
faculty members than majors. And we were turning 
out a third or more of the graduates, certifying

28:09.522 --> 28:18.131
them, and we had three full-time people. Now, 
Glenn Johnson served as department head how long?

28:24.558 --> 28:25.780
Oh, at least five years. Then who followed him? Bob 
Schutz followed him. We seemed to just wear our

28:30.585 --> 28:32.928
department heads out. It's a big job with all the 
certification and so on, but Glenn Johnson was

28:33.388 --> 28:38.854
getting ill. Then Bob Schutz took over and he had a 
heart attack.

28:46.824 --> 28:54.480
Then we had David David and Phil Limbacher.

28:57.582 --> 29:04.438
Well, about Peters, Jim Kroc, a very fine man. And

29:04.498 --> 29:12.857
then I retired about, I think we had,

29:18.068 --> 29:22.235
I'm sorry, her name is so... You retired what year? 
1992. But I broke my hip in 89, and I think I went on

29:23.838 --> 29:28.727
half time for a while. All right. During those 
years, What was the primary function of the

29:33.593 --> 29:37.079
department head? What was he or she to do? That was 
everything, as far as I could tell. Of course, I see

29:43.870 --> 29:53.866
it from without being the department head, but I 
think he was responsible for everything. Under

29:53.947 --> 29:56.631
Dean Hubert, I think Dean Hubert kind said, this is 
your job, but you report to me. But I think, like

30:00.134 --> 30:07.283
Glenn Johnson and Bob Schutz, they had to do 
everything. Now, when Dean Hubert moved up to be

30:07.863 --> 30:12.689
chancellor, who followed him as? Oh, this was, and 
I was on the committee that selected him. Was that

30:18.696 --> 30:19.798
Dean Corrigan? Dean Corrigan, wonderful man. 
Fairly different style, but very effective.

30:25.231 --> 30:26.993
Describe his manner. Jolly and very

30:28.355 --> 30:33.983
insightful. I think he knew everything he said. He 
could back it up. He was interested in all areas.

30:44.738 --> 30:49.374
But he was more accessible and congenial. Dean 
Hubert was congenial but harsher, kind of. The

30:56.534 --> 30:59.180
surface was a little harder. Dean Corrigan was 
very accessible. And he served until about the

31:02.327 --> 31:05.835
time you retired, didn't he? Yes. Did the college 
make good progress during those years, you think?

31:08.942 --> 31:09.323
Oh, yes. I think more than ever. I think the 
visibility, because Dean Corrigan had some
