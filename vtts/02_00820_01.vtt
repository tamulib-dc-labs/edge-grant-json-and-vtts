WEBVTT

00:04.233 --> 00:05.014
Go ahead and start. I am

00:05.114 --> 00:13.146
Mrs. Joe Blaisdell of Richmond, Texas, Fort Bend 
County. I have lived here all of my life.

00:19.716 --> 00:22.339
Mr. Blaisdell.

00:23.802 --> 00:30.291
I'm Joe Blaisdell,

00:23.802 --> 00:30.291
Richmond, Texas, Fort Bend County. And I've lived 
there practically all my life. I was born in

00:36.605 --> 00:38.367
Indiana. And I came to Texas with my folks when I 
couldn't quite carry my own bag. In fact, I

00:47.136 --> 00:48.698
couldn't walk. Okay, why did your folks come to 
Fort Bend County? Well, I think more than anything

00:54.505 --> 00:59.991
else, my daddy wanted to move to a warmer climate. 
All right, what did y'all do when you came here?

01:03.878 --> 01:05.279
What did your dad do for a living? A farmer. A 
farmer. And Ms. Blaser, what's your approach to

01:08.002 --> 01:10.925
this? Well, my father was born in Harris County and 
moved here as a small child with his family. And my

01:18.694 --> 01:26.682
mother came to Texas from Missouri when she was 10, 
and they were looking for warmer climate, I think.

01:28.364 --> 01:30.366
My father was a building contractor. was killed in 
that activity. What year was this when they came

01:34.813 --> 01:36.456
here? My mother is 83 today, and she was 12 years 
old. Okay. Could you tell me, you know, like some of

01:47.333 --> 01:55.746
the, do you remember some of the families here that 
when you were a child, the influential families

01:47.333 --> 01:55.746
loved? Fort Bend County, Rosenberg, or Richmond. 
I was born in Rosenberg. Yes, ma'am. And married

02:03.122 --> 02:07.526
and moved to Richmond in 31. Okay. You want to know 
about Richmond people? Well, it doesn't matter.

02:12.851 --> 02:14.013
Fort Bend County as a whole. Just, you know, what 
you remember. Well, up until the time I moved and

02:17.116 --> 02:26.425
married here, although the towns were so close, I 
did not know too many people here very well. But the

02:26.810 --> 02:32.835
Moore family were politically and financially 
prominent. Judge Moore and all of his sons. The

02:38.200 --> 02:41.824
Bassett family was a family. These are families 
that were here back in history. They've been here a

02:44.866 --> 02:46.148
long time.

02:50.011 --> 02:53.714
This was primarily agriculture and ranching at 
that time. There's been a lot of industry come in

02:53.754 --> 02:56.597
since that time. Do you remember any, for 
instance, floods or droughts or anything in

02:57.725 --> 03:04.256
particular? Yes.

03:11.067 --> 03:13.291
There was a terrible flood in 1913. I don't 
remember too much of it except a lot of water, and we

03:13.471 --> 03:20.863
were in it. When we were moving out, my people were 
farming at the time, and we moved out, and I

03:21.856 --> 03:31.189
remember the wagons and loaded with things in the 
water and the wheels. That was 1913, and oh, off and

03:32.030 --> 03:37.398
on through the years, yes, we've had bad floods. 
Joe was old enough probably to tell you something

03:37.858 --> 03:43.246
about the 1913 flood, were you, Joe? Well, the 1913 
flood was It was the biggest flood that I've ever

03:48.046 --> 03:55.094
heard any of the old-timers ever talk about. At 
that time, the water was all the way past Sugar

03:55.154 --> 04:00.880
Land. You could go from here to Sugar Land in a boat. 
What kind of bridge did they have across the river?

04:11.111 --> 04:12.653
Was there a different bridge? Well, the river 
bridge is the same bridge that was there in 1913.

04:18.438 --> 04:28.823
But the wagon bridge was up above the railroad 
bridge about two blocks, three blocks. And it was

04:30.767 --> 04:31.890
just a... old steel framework bridge with a wooden 
floor in it. Now was this, there was one I heard that

04:36.556 --> 04:44.787
was from Navasota that they brought down from 
Navasota, but it was washed out when they were

04:36.556 --> 04:44.787
driving some cattle. Well, that bridge went down 
before we ever got here. But I can remember after

04:51.417 --> 04:59.008
they built this second bridge there at the same 
location. I remember back when they Oh, some of

05:00.727 --> 05:16.711
these people that had farms and ranches south of 
town and across the river and so forth, that when

05:00.727 --> 05:16.711
they moved cattle, they wouldn't let them move but 
10 head at a time across that bridge. And cattle

05:16.731 --> 05:21.017
would get to trotting in that bridge and go 
swinging. Yes, sir. And shucks, there'd be lots of

05:22.640 --> 05:28.168
time getting maybe Two, three hundred head or more 
of cattle across that bridge. It took a lot of time,

05:33.257 --> 05:36.361
that ten-headed time. What year did it fall in? Ah, 
that last one fell in 1922, and that flood in 22. We

05:46.295 --> 05:52.103
used to ferry that from then until about 26, wasn't 
it? 25. 25, 1925. How'd they work the ferry? Was it

05:55.327 --> 05:56.048
a... It was a... Hand power. Hand power? had a cable 
and all they had was sort of a board and they were

05:59.182 --> 06:13.198
about two and a half feet long with blocks nailed on 
the end of it. Two blocks where they'd line and go

06:13.318 --> 06:17.643
through it and they'd catch it. What happened to 
it? It got washed away or they just built a new

06:20.046 --> 06:23.029
bridge or what? They built a new bridge on this side 
of the railroad bridge. When did Highway 59 come

06:27.954 --> 06:30.816
through? This bridge was built right there. It was 
opened in 1925, this steel bridge down here. The

06:40.585 --> 06:50.755
old bridge went in on 22 and then we rode the ferry 
from then on until we got the new bridge built. The

06:50.775 --> 06:53.978
ferry was over by the 138th Street. The road is in 
the same location

06:54.785 --> 07:02.532
going to Houston. And originally, it was on the 
north side of the railroad track when they put the

07:04.614 --> 07:15.905
new bridge in, where they got it on the south side 
all the way through. But there's about a mile out

07:16.685 --> 07:21.670
there that's on the north side of the track and then 
had to cross over. And that was, oh, that road was a

07:24.232 --> 07:31.820
shell road way back when I was a little bit of kid. 
That shell from Richmond, Houston. Do you know

07:37.206 --> 07:39.828
anything about how Richmond got started? You 
know, like Richmond-Rosenberg, the background

07:39.848 --> 07:44.353
of it? Well, Richmond got started back,

07:44.553 --> 07:53.783
oh, 18-something.

07:54.775 --> 07:59.499
That is according to the history of Fort Bend 
County. People came from Galveston down to Mouth

08:00.581 --> 08:12.031
of the Brothers down here, and then come up the 
river and found this bend in the river. And they

08:13.753 --> 08:17.116
liked the looks of it, so that's where they started 
the town. Yes, they built the fort here. I don't

08:20.980 --> 08:24.343
know whether you know it or not, From that bridge 
over here to the WKM plant, it's only about a mile.

08:34.468 --> 08:38.894
And the Brazos River is right behind that WKM 
plant. But it makes this way long loop up there.

08:43.419 --> 08:49.707
It's 10, 12 miles around the river that make that 
one mile across there. Richmond got its charter at

08:50.007 --> 08:57.214
the same time Houston got theirs in the name of 
Harrisburg. But they had visions of navigating

08:58.115 --> 09:04.361
the Brazos River. But Houston got busy and worked 
up the ship channel, dug it out, and processed

09:05.322 --> 09:12.970
that. So they grew and we didn't. Nothing was done 
here. Now, Santa Ana came through Richmond, right

09:16.233 --> 09:19.356
over here, didn't you? Through this general area, 
I don't know just where. Because I read somewhere

09:23.152 --> 09:28.220
like, you know, the Jane Long graveyard right over 
here. Jane Long is in the Morton Cemetery. The

09:30.584 --> 09:31.725
Morton Cemetery, that's right. And didn't Santa, 
well, you know, I read somewhere that Santa came

09:32.186 --> 09:38.235
through there and he destroyed some of the graves, 
his soldiers. That I couldn't tell you. But that

09:41.781 --> 09:44.245
cemetery is something to see. If you were to go 
through it and visit it, the names in history that

09:47.517 --> 09:52.103
you know on the tombstones over there, Dex Smith. 
Jane Long, where was her boarding house here? You

09:57.551 --> 09:59.854
know where the coffee shop is. It was right behind 
it. In fact, it was only torn down. Post Office

10:05.782 --> 10:07.284
Pharmacy. This building, her boarding house was 
torn down about what, Joe? What, five years ago? I

10:13.953 --> 10:15.195
don't know. I don't know, but I've always been 
under the impression that that boarding house was

10:16.053 --> 10:25.166
across the track, which burned down. I can 
remember when it burned down. It was an old

10:29.112 --> 10:32.637
two-story hotel building deal. It was just across 
the railroad track right at the back of that drug

10:34.180 --> 10:37.825
store down there. Well, now, this house that they 
tore down a few years ago was the one that was

10:38.817 --> 10:45.665
supposed to have been hers. The one in the back of 
that old Mama Schiff's old home? Right back of Post

10:50.772 --> 10:53.455
Office Pharmacy. Well, that old Mama Schiff, 
that's where Jake Eichmann was raised. Mama

10:57.319 --> 10:59.502
Schiff, who was she? Well, she was an old Jewish 
rabbi's wife. But this Jake Eichmann, all these

11:04.088 --> 11:08.453
Eichmann sporting goods stores in Houston, Yes, 
sir. And all over the state.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.162
Mama Schiff was his aunt. And they raised him right 
there. He went to business in Richmond when he was a

11:21.947 --> 11:26.773
young man. Okay, the Oshman's is here in Richmond 
now. That doesn't have anything to do with the

11:29.576 --> 11:33.360
Oshman's Burning Goods, does it? There's the 
Eichmanns over here now. They're probably

11:37.559 --> 11:42.105
practically all of them some kind of kinfolk. 
That's right. That's right. There were several

11:46.070 --> 11:55.281
families, but then they're all of them cousins or 
brothers or what have you. Harry Robinson in

11:55.502 --> 11:57.024
there. His wife is an Eichmann. Robinson. He runs 
that store. Oh, OK. Another question. You've

12:07.546 --> 12:09.009
lived here all these years. What changes have you 
seen, for instance, in the schools and the means of

12:09.089 --> 12:19.945
making a living, just general appearance of the 
town? Well, building, I guess, is the biggest

12:21.347 --> 12:23.930
thing. Ever since the war was over, there's been 
tremendous growth in the two towns. And well, you

12:32.555 --> 12:36.499
can see how much it's grown since you came here just 
a little while. There is some industry here now

12:37.641 --> 12:42.065
where for years we had no industry. Gins and the 
cotton oil mill out here, and that was just about

12:42.946 --> 12:48.593
it. We just didn't have any industry. Could you 
tell me about the schools?

12:56.181 --> 12:58.984
Lamar Consolidated was consolidated in what, 60? 
No, no. Lamar Consolidated was

13:00.213 --> 13:22.869
the independent districts of Rosenberg and 
Richmond, and then the rural areas that worked

13:00.213 --> 13:22.869
through the courthouse or through the state 
system went in with them within these boundaries

13:00.213 --> 13:22.869
sounded. This was done by vote in 1947. And I set up 
the first tax rolls in 1948. I was their assessor

13:31.272 --> 13:34.555
and collector from 48 through 57. And then

13:34.635 --> 13:42.004
retired from that. And it showed tremendous 
growth in that period of time, but then it was, we

13:42.084 --> 13:52.135
thought it was, but it just doesn't compare at all 
to what's happened since then. Well, has there

13:53.196 --> 13:55.819
been a period of just stagnation like since the 
war, where it just, you know, just everything kind

13:56.221 --> 14:03.610
of leveled off for a while? Are you talking about 
the economy, the school, or what? Well, just

14:07.335 --> 14:10.318
general growth of the Fort Bend County Yards. It's 
just been growing ever since the war. It's been

14:12.141 --> 14:13.282
growing ever since. And when I left the school, I 
went into the savings and loan business, where I

14:14.824 --> 14:22.093
had an opportunity to watch buildings. And it just 
constantly grew. And we kept thinking, well, it

14:26.331 --> 14:28.373
has to slow down. But it didn't until just 
recently. When did the Savings and Loans start?

14:33.137 --> 14:34.298
What year was this? The Gulf Coast started in 1958. 
1958. OK. There was one at Rosenberg that got its

14:39.822 --> 14:42.905
charter in 1933. Is that the Fort Bend? Fort Bend 
Federal. Fort Bend Federal. OK. And another

14:48.089 --> 14:52.333
thing. people coming into the community like, you 
know, like your Czechs and your Germans and what

14:52.820 --> 15:02.311
nationalities were here when y'all? Well, I can 
remember when I knew everyone in Rosenberg and it

15:04.073 --> 15:11.442
was primarily German and Czech. There were a few 
Mexicans and of course there were your Negroes.

15:17.128 --> 15:18.650
There were not too many others. There were a few 
English. Dr. Yates' family, that group, but there

15:21.794 --> 15:25.479
was not many. That was it. Okay, and like... A few 
Jews, you know. That would be the Oshmans and all of

15:30.887 --> 15:33.531
them, right? Well, now, I'm talking about when I 
was coming along, and that would be... Oh, there

15:33.612 --> 15:43.807
were the Rosenzweigs and the Lipmans and... Well, 
the Oshmans weren't here then? Yes, they weren't

15:44.808 --> 15:45.870
here. They were in Richmond. Okay, gotcha then. 
You see, Richmond did not want the railroad. Santa

15:55.424 --> 15:58.007
Fe. The Santa Fe railroad. They did not want all of 
that track and all of this, the hub for all these

15:59.068 --> 16:06.815
different areas. So Rosenberg was selected as a 
site for this. And it was named for a man named

16:13.902 --> 16:17.265
Rosenberg. It was the Rosenberg Library in 
Galveston. He was a financier. He was a big man. And

16:22.882 --> 16:26.787
he was instrumental in getting Rosenberg 
started. That's why Rosenberg was started,

16:26.828 --> 16:32.635
because Richmond didn't want it. Rosenberg 
started that, more or less, as a water stop on St.

16:32.655 --> 16:39.725
Pete.

16:39.945 --> 16:44.652
All the locomotives were steamed then, and they 
had to get water. There were nine men. And they had a

16:49.004 --> 16:55.930
pump station there in Rodenburg for years until 
they wanted diesel. Of course, they had two

16:55.950 --> 17:08.241
railroads together, Southern City and Santa Fe, 
and both used water from the same well and tank.

17:08.261 --> 17:19.011
Okay, like, when did, uh, when, you know, like, 
modern facilities, like, when did y'all get city

17:08.261 --> 17:19.011
sewage and water and all this? My uncle put in the 
first electric plant and ice plant in Richmond and

17:21.387 --> 17:34.319
Rosenberg in

17:21.387 --> 17:34.319
the early 20s, I guess. Very early 20s. I know I was 
just, it might have been before 20, was it, Joe?

17:40.925 --> 17:43.927
Well, of course, they had an ice and light plant 
here. But Rosenberg is. And your uncle bought them

17:45.669 --> 17:47.471
out. Well, but Rosenberg, he put that in. That's 
the old Rosenberg light, was the light plant now.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.142
The Houston Light and Power Company bought him 
out. Okay. Him and his partner, there were two of

17:56.603 --> 17:58.405
them. Didn't he? Now, where's that ice plant in 
Rosenberg I've seen by the U-Totem over there? You

18:03.069 --> 18:04.130
know what I'm talking about? Not by the U-Totem, 
but it's back there by Lane's Trading Post? Right.

18:07.954 --> 18:08.695
Back in there. All right. Is that the old plant that 
you're talking about? Right. Okay. And he sold it

18:13.740 --> 18:16.082
to the Houston Light and Power Company. It was 
before the 20s. I was a little girl when they put

18:17.811 --> 18:20.915
electric lights in our house. It was way before 
that. I

18:23.799 --> 18:32.690
know it was before 1923, but I don't remember yet 
when it was built. It was planned to come down here.

18:39.502 --> 18:40.643
It was wild here. The only time we had lights was at 
night. They'd crank that generator up down there

18:42.906 --> 18:48.932
and run it at night and take time to shut it down. We 
didn't get natural gas until about 26? 26, I think.

18:55.779 --> 18:58.102
I think it was about 26. In fact, it was almost 27. 
Boy, it was 27 before they got Got all the customers

19:07.227 --> 19:11.391
hooked up on fuel. I'd say the electricity was 
shortly before the 1920s. Gas about 1926. And then

19:17.256 --> 19:22.321
they began, everybody had septic tanks, you know. 
Then, I don't know just exactly when they did put

19:22.361 --> 19:25.985
the sewage in. They had no sewage deal here. They 
just run off. Of course, that was before the

19:32.711 --> 19:34.973
bridges there. Just run off. Well, they just 
wanted to open the river right there. Well, there

19:40.153 --> 19:44.378
was a building over there that burned right at this 
end of the bridge. There used to be a water tower

19:46.641 --> 19:54.372
right there, and the sewage went right over the 
river right there at the back of it. And that was

19:54.392 --> 20:01.361
just a sort of a get-by proposition for some 
people. They didn't try to cover all the towns.

20:05.328 --> 20:24.649
That in 1929

20:05.328 --> 20:24.649
is when they started then to put this

20:05.328 --> 20:24.649
sewer business in, 2930 along there. That's when 
they put sewers all over town here. That's what was

20:30.336 --> 20:31.757
about to say. All right. Another question. Do 
y'all remember

20:37.171 --> 20:54.932
anything real big that happened, for instance, 
like bank robberies, murders, or any big court

20:37.171 --> 20:54.932
cases of any type that was in Mr. Rosenberg? Within 
our lifetimes, it was pretty settled. Before

21:01.019 --> 21:02.440
that, it was rugged. Well, I don't remember ever 
having a bank robbery handled here. a couple of

21:06.888 --> 21:14.278
years ago when this camp was running out of 
motorcycles and they caught him out here before he

21:06.888 --> 21:14.278
got five miles from town. Well, do y'all know, do 
y'all, have y'all ever heard of any of the famous

21:14.358 --> 21:21.708
outlaws, you know, like they came from 
Richmond-Rosenberg? I mean, no, Richmond was a

21:22.750 --> 21:25.694
pretty rugged town when it first started.

21:28.357 --> 21:34.806
I think it had more reputation than it actually, 
than was actually fact. I think a lot of that was Of

21:36.925 --> 21:38.067
course, it was rugged. It had to be to survive. I 
think a lot of its reputation came from your

21:41.332 --> 21:46.200
woodpeckers, you know, Jaybird's woodpeckers. 
That's another thing to ask about the Jaybird and

21:46.300 --> 21:50.046
the woodpecker revolt. Well, of course, that was 
before my time and his time. Did y'all ever hear

21:54.533 --> 21:57.558
anything about it? Jaybird then was in 1889. 
That's when they had that shootout. Didn't the

22:06.018 --> 22:11.005
governor had to send the state militia down here or 
something to break it up? No. I never read anything

22:13.229 --> 22:17.095
about it or heard anything about it.

22:22.302 --> 22:25.527
Back when I was a little kid, of course, I was a 
Yankee.

22:28.892 --> 22:33.139
But there used to be an old man here, old Major 
Davidson. He was an old Confederate veteran. And

22:37.118 --> 22:45.390
he took me to several different Confederate 
conventions. And I just, oh, I was 10, 12 years old,

22:47.193 --> 22:51.218
I guess. And I

22:53.361 --> 22:57.247
was shook. So I played a lot of them old bugger 
talking, but I never did hear anybody say anything

22:57.267 --> 23:04.898
about them sending me. state militia and things 
like that. I don't know whether we even had state

23:08.712 --> 23:12.017
militia back in those days. Well, it doesn't say 
anything about it in your Wharton's history of

23:12.318 --> 23:17.285
Fort Bend or any of those. I haven't read of it. The 
reason I said that is because I, you know, like in

23:18.226 --> 23:26.138
the book that I'm taking, Texas History Now, and I 
read somewhere in the book it said something about

23:18.226 --> 23:26.138
the Jaybird. Jaybird and Whitpecker revolt. And 
it said something like the governor, I forgot who

23:29.463 --> 23:33.889
the governor was during that period, but he sent 
They called for him for help, and I think I heard he

23:34.898 --> 23:42.767
sent the state militia down here, or some men 
maybe, just some men to break it up. Well, the fight

23:43.087 --> 23:54.861
was pretty much between the old timers right here, 
you know, that the coffee baggers came in and they

23:43.087 --> 23:54.861
were taking over the offices and running things. 
Oh, several of them personally were in the know.

24:03.434 --> 24:06.557
What was the policy of the Jaybirds and the 
Woodpeckers? Was it like the Republicans and

24:06.597 --> 24:13.285
Democrats of nowadays, or would it be the 
Radicals? Well, they had a problem there that went

24:13.445 --> 24:19.872
back to the Civil War. You know, there's lots of 
people in Washington and in the northern states

24:21.794 --> 24:29.442
that wanted to run on the Confederate States 
pretty rough when the war was over. And they had

24:37.711 --> 24:49.484
some people here in the courthouse that seemed to 
be looking out for number one more than anything

24:37.711 --> 24:49.484
else. And finally, my chief and local people got 
together and decided to move them out. And they

25:01.855 --> 25:05.298
did. Yeah, the old courthouse used to sit right 
where the city hall, right in the middle of that

25:05.318 --> 25:16.167
block where the city hall lived down there. There, 
there in . Before they built this new courthouse.

25:19.791 --> 25:20.111
Okay. And that was the courthouse in 1889 when they 
had the fight, and there was bullet holes around

25:20.131 --> 25:30.580
them walls in there.

25:31.876 --> 25:38.706
One old skimp that I knew real well was just, well, I 
believe he was 14 years old.

25:41.850 --> 25:51.023
And this house, well, it's right back post office. 
On the highway there. It's got a sort of a story and a

25:53.567 --> 25:58.153
half, and that was a Mack Farland home. old man 
Earl, they called him old man Earl, he was 14 years

26:00.732 --> 26:07.039
old then. And he ended up down one of them little 
dormer windows up there in the back of the house and

26:09.022 --> 26:20.575
shooting right in through the courthouse, right 
in through the door of the courthouse. How many

26:20.615 --> 26:23.418
people were injured or killed in that thing? Was it 
just blown out of proportion? Well, the thing of it

26:25.801 --> 26:29.946
was, it was some killings there. Even before the 
fight here, there was killings in Wharton,

26:33.257 --> 26:45.034
Galveston, and all the people from around here. 
The

26:45.074 --> 26:57.992
main thing here is when I was a kid, I'd say at least 
Half or more than half of the people around here

27:00.115 --> 27:07.664
always wore pistols. And they didn't wear it to be 
mean or tough or anything. They just wore it, by

27:14.892 --> 27:17.655
golly, for protection. And they didn't let 
anybody run over them. And the only woodpecker

27:23.241 --> 27:29.008
that I remember lived right across the street here 
when I started school. He was the only one that I

27:31.385 --> 27:37.651
ever knew of around here that people said was a 
woodpecker. And he admitted it himself, but he

27:37.671 --> 27:42.836
wasn't involved in the fight at all. He lived right 
across the street. He ended up dying. His daughter

27:51.004 --> 27:56.029
works down there for love now, that Miss Harris 
down there. There's an old man booting his

27:56.049 --> 27:58.451
daughter. Uh-huh. Miss Harris. Ms. Harris has got 
a daughter that teaches at the school. Is that,

28:04.690 --> 28:06.833
what's her name? She's an art teacher. Is that the 
one? I don't know. Because there's the lady,

28:10.759 --> 28:16.246
there's the daughter, and then there's the mother 
that works at Love's. No, the daughter doesn't

28:17.047 --> 28:18.409
have a daughter. No, not the daughter, but the son 
did. You know what I'm talking about? There was no

28:21.133 --> 28:22.715
son. The daughter. Audrey Harris had only 
daughters. And then she had, one of the daughters

28:25.359 --> 28:31.007
got married and the husband ran off, and she had a 
boy by her. I was just wondering about that. But

28:36.743 --> 28:44.234
another thing, when y'all were kids, what went on 
around here? Like nowadays, we go to the show. Most

28:46.858 --> 28:47.979
of the time, we go to Houston. What did y'all do 
around here? I did the same thing. Went to Houston

28:52.626 --> 28:53.848
to shop. Went to Houston during the week. We'd go on 
Sunday afternoons to the movies or something like

28:56.552 --> 29:00.318
that. Joe played baseball. Yeah, but that was up 
29, 30, along there. Well, we played ball around

29:11.060 --> 29:15.928
here back when I was a little kid. We didn't have 
anybody arrange any games or anything. We just got

29:19.073 --> 29:23.240
together and chewed a little side and played ball.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.808
Well, we had a lot of parties. And church. 
Everybody went to church more. There was a lot of

29:31.021 --> 29:34.825
social life connected with your churches. What 
was the main church here? What was your main church

29:38.208 --> 29:39.750
in Richmond? Baptist and Baptist. There's the 
Tozer up there. And Catholic? I figured the

29:45.395 --> 29:49.099
Catholic would be because they always get checks. 
Catholic church. It was put in here. Well, the

29:53.724 --> 29:56.867
Episcopal church, it wasn't there. didn't have 
near the congregation that the Baptists had. They

30:01.567 --> 30:05.119
had the money.
