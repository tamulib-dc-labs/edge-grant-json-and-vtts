WEBVTT

00:06.443 --> 00:07.907
You're talking about the core. Yeah, well, the 
organization and the discipline and the

00:08.048 --> 00:19.862
relationships

00:08.048 --> 00:19.862
are all invaluable, I think, to me. I kind of feel 
like some potential student asking, are you going

00:20.197 --> 00:31.468
to have to get in the Corps? And the response is, 
sir, it's a privilege to be in the Corps. And I

00:37.134 --> 00:40.197
really feel somewhat that way about it. It was an 
experience that I would certainly not want to have

00:40.217 --> 00:45.402
missed. And I value Rice, certainly. in a 
different way. I never would have had that

00:51.454 --> 00:55.638
experience if I'd stayed there. So that element, 
the living in the dormitory and the military part,

00:57.740 --> 01:06.368
discipline, were all significant. One of the 
other great advantages in this pre-decor

01:06.588 --> 01:16.917
situation is that You're welcome. There's an 
Aggie anywhere. And I've traveled. After I left

01:23.989 --> 01:37.322
A&M in 58, I've traveled, well, I shouldn't say all 
over the world, but a lot of international places

01:23.989 --> 01:37.322
and certainly a lot in the United States.

01:39.444 --> 01:41.646
I was with the Asgrove Seed Company. It wasn't a big 
company, but we had operations everywhere. all

01:46.681 --> 01:51.146
the way from the east coast to California and Texas 
to New England. So you'd run into Aggies

01:52.927 --> 02:02.738
everywhere, and it was just a wonderful 
experience to be able to greet each other and know

01:52.927 --> 02:02.738
that you were. And then the third ring was 
something for quick recognition and the

02:02.798 --> 02:10.245
sincerity of it, too. It was fun. Impressed me. 
It's not just, oh, there you are in Aggie, et

02:12.087 --> 02:15.591
cetera. There's some meaning in the motion to it. 
Let's make believe that someone gives you a check

02:18.979 --> 02:28.612
for a million dollars, and there's only one 
requirement they attach to that check. You must

02:28.632 --> 02:37.624
give it to Texas A&M, but you decide what the 
money's going to be used for. If that were to

02:37.644 --> 02:43.072
happen, what would you want them to do with that 
million dollars? Want A&M to do? What would you do?

02:45.592 --> 02:55.402
If you had a million dollars you could pass on to 
anyone, what would be what you'd want them to spend

02:45.592 --> 02:55.402
it for? Well, just an off-the-cuff reaction is to 
expand the course some way so that more people

02:55.422 --> 03:02.149
could have the benefit of that experience. That 
may not be exactly the type of thing you have in

03:02.730 --> 03:07.435
mind. And or scholarships for students. Would it 
matter what they studied, in your preference? No,

03:21.509 --> 03:31.706
I think I would divert, well, I don't know whether 
you could do that with a million dollars, but I

03:21.509 --> 03:31.706
would think some diversity would be desirable, as 
far as I'm personally concerned. I don't want them

03:32.067 --> 03:34.471
all in agronomy, for example. I wouldn't want to 
give it all to agronomy if I would be doing that.

03:41.228 --> 03:53.988
probably restrict it to agriculture and make it 
broad enough that it would broaden the potential

03:41.228 --> 03:53.988
of it rather than narrow it too much. Last 
question. What feelings do you have when your

03:55.610 --> 03:58.454
heart touches anything?

04:03.182 --> 04:06.747
On balance, I certainly have a very very favorable 
reaction to my experience with Texas A&M. I think,

04:12.333 --> 04:35.839
since I'm not having to run it, I think

04:12.333 --> 04:35.839
there's an institution of higher learning in the 
state and largely funded by the state that should

04:12.333 --> 04:35.839
really look ahead as to what it could be 
institution contribute to the future in the

04:36.359 --> 04:45.852
education of the youth that are coming up. And I 
don't know exactly how to do this, but I think it's

04:45.872 --> 04:56.147
imperative that we educate a broader range of our 
society. If we don't, we'll decline instead of go

04:56.928 --> 05:02.636
up there. And that may just be my point. I know we 
speak of a method term a lot of times, but I'm trying

05:05.249 --> 05:22.275
to look at it as an overall situation that we need to 
educate the youth regardless of the evidence that

05:05.249 --> 05:22.275
we're using. And it's only in doing this that we'll 
be able to continue to develop and grow, and to me

05:22.296 --> 05:29.687
that's a To me, it ought to be the greatest concern 
of the administration of the university. And

05:38.829 --> 05:51.405
perhaps, well, you've been in budget situations 
all your life, so I'm not telling you anything, but

05:38.829 --> 05:51.405
there's never enough money to do all the things you 
want, so you must make choices. I

05:52.229 --> 06:12.212
really

05:52.229 --> 06:12.212
think

05:52.229 --> 06:12.212
the education we use should have priority over 
some of these high polluting research

05:52.229 --> 06:12.212
situations, as an example. And I've been in 
research most of my life. Sure, there has to be

06:17.258 --> 06:19.080
some. is the attention to the youth and both 
enabling them to come to school. And I don't, I have

06:29.568 --> 06:42.708
a little trouble with this, you telling me there's 
half the school or top 10% of the classrooms. That

06:42.728 --> 06:49.658
means there are a lot of other people that aren't 
getting an opportunity for an education, at least

06:42.728 --> 06:49.658
here. The difficulty with the alternative is how 
large can you let the enrollment become and to whom

06:50.549 --> 07:03.226
do you give preference? I'm well aware that it's a 
difficult situation. I just saw it as a reality.

07:13.080 --> 07:16.685
We do need to be providing education. Some of it is 
possible to... And I'm not one of those people that

07:19.760 --> 07:28.633
everybody's got to have a college education. But 
to particularly offer the potential to, I

07:28.653 --> 07:32.378
haven't. I still get the Harvard Review of 
Propaganda, maybe. But they, I think they follow.

07:42.533 --> 07:43.874
I don't think it's just an episode. It's a policy of 
providing an educated course. They have high

07:47.119 --> 07:49.142
academic requirements to get in. But they won't 
refuse a student because of financial

07:49.797 --> 07:59.110
needs.

07:59.210 --> 08:11.646
They made a commitment to fund the qualified 
student as far as financial needs are concerned if

07:59.210 --> 08:11.646
they've got the interest and abilities and 
technicalities

07:59.210 --> 08:11.646
to go there. It's not a simple thing, but I think 
University, I'll keep that in mind all the time,

08:18.130 --> 08:45.370
about doing what it can to educate the youth of this 
state, and particularly,

08:18.130 --> 08:45.370
and this is where, I don't know just how you 
perceive, some of this may mean education of a

08:18.130 --> 08:45.370
less, of less than the elite, if you don't look at it 
that way, but we need the people in all of aspects of

08:45.839 --> 08:47.301
society.

08:50.785 --> 08:54.889
I think we're going to have to do something to help 
them out. Have we left any important topics out?

08:59.234 --> 09:02.938
I'd have a hard time recounting what all was said. I 
think all of the significance of what I'm

09:03.099 --> 09:07.864
thinking.
