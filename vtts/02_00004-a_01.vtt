WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:07.467
This is June 23, one, two, three, four.

00:07.787 --> 00:08.690
Say a sentence or two.

00:09.091 --> 00:16.268
Well, this is the second day of summer, and it's the second longest year of the day, but it's three minutes shorter than yesterday.

00:19.522 --> 00:28.551
We're on the West Campus and I have the pleasure and honor of chatting today with Perry Adkisson about his faculty experiences.

00:29.452 --> 00:37.180
Perry, before we start recording your experiences here, would you describe where you grew up, where you went to college?

00:38.121 --> 00:42.005
Summarize your experience before you came to work for A&M.

00:42.025 --> 00:43.487
Well, I grew up

00:44.513 --> 00:52.543
on a small cotton soybean farm in northeast Arkansas in Mississippi County in a community called Hickman.

00:53.604 --> 00:58.110
The local people called it Hickman Bend because it's one of the shortest bends in the Mississippi River.

00:59.632 --> 01:06.621
And our farm was right on the river and near the Missouri line.

01:06.641 --> 01:13.069
I went to high school at a small high school called Armarel, which is

01:13.606 --> 01:17.650
outside of Blyville, which was the county seat for Mississippi County.

01:18.690 --> 01:24.375
And I graduated in 1946 in a large class of six people.

01:25.857 --> 01:33.644
All the boys except I think two of us had already volunteered for the Army in World War II.

01:36.066 --> 01:42.111
Anyway, I went from Arm Rel High School

01:44.504 --> 01:50.611
through the influence of our local county agent named Keith Bilbrey to the University of Arkansas.

01:51.852 --> 02:03.946
And I received a degree from University of Arkansas in 1950 in general agriculture.

02:05.728 --> 02:10.073
And shortly after I

02:11.656 --> 02:22.851
left the university, I had a job teaching vocational ag for a while at Blytheville High School in a veterans program, but the Korean War broke out the summer.

02:23.212 --> 02:27.778
I graduated in the middle of May and then sometimes June and July.

02:27.798 --> 02:34.727
The war broke out and I was drafted the following in the winter and went in the army and

02:35.551 --> 02:49.678
January of or in March, I think, of 1951 and served during the Korean War at most of my service was at Fort Benning, Georgia.

02:51.008 --> 03:06.788
And I was discharged a month early to reenter the University of Arkansas in January of 1953 where I studied for a master's degree in agronomy.

03:06.808 --> 03:16.881
I received my degree in May of 1954 and in the process had become quite interested in entomology.

03:16.861 --> 03:33.520
And eventually applied for graduate school and assistantship at Kansas State University where University of Arkansas, my professors there had sent a lot of students.

03:34.360 --> 03:39.215
And so I went to Kansas State where I did my Ph.D.

03:40.820 --> 03:44.972
and in the latter stages my Ph.D.

03:45.193 --> 03:47.560
I had been

03:48.637 --> 04:07.740
working in the summers as a student checking cotton for insects and then eventually it worked up to the point that I was doing a crop entomology and protection and consulting for a large corporate farm in Arkansas called Elms Planting Company at Pine Bluff.

04:09.102 --> 04:15.690
And I was, of course in the summer I was making good money.

04:15.670 --> 04:18.253
more than I was made in my first job.

04:18.273 --> 04:29.607
But as a result of that experience, the University of Missouri had created a position for a cotton entomologist in the Boot Hill, which you know about.

04:30.608 --> 04:33.011
You know that part of the country.

04:33.031 --> 04:36.115
They were opening up a little field station at Sykeston, Missouri.

04:37.677 --> 04:39.619
So they recruited me.

04:40.038 --> 04:49.708
At first they came and they wanted me to come before I finished my degree, and I said, no, I'm not going to take a job until I finish.

04:49.868 --> 04:53.512
I'm going to finish everything because if I ever take a job, I might never finish.

04:54.313 --> 04:57.096
So they hired somebody else, but something happened.

04:57.116 --> 05:00.359
He didn't work out or something in the process.

05:00.379 --> 05:06.265
That last year of graduate school, this person moved on, so that opening came back open.

05:06.245 --> 05:10.651
So I went to work for the University of Missouri in March 1956.

05:10.911 --> 05:23.207
The day I completed my oral defense of my thesis and turned my thesis in, so I was completed all requirements for the degree.

05:23.227 --> 05:27.392
I got in my car and I drove to Columbia, Missouri and went on the payroll.

05:28.503 --> 05:41.026
and stayed at Columbia for a little bit, but my job was to be in Sykeston, so I moved to Sykeston in the Boot Hill in early 1956.

05:43.310 --> 05:51.625
And then the cotton entomology, the people who work in cotton, they have a

05:51.976 --> 06:02.748
large meeting every January, still do, called the Cotton Research and Mechanization Conference, which is sponsored by the National Cotton Council.

06:02.808 --> 06:10.517
So all the cotton research and extension people get together at meetings.

06:10.537 --> 06:14.541
At that time, every other year, they'd meet in Memphis, Tennessee at the old Peabody Hotel.

06:16.464 --> 06:19.587
So I had gone to that meeting in

06:20.208 --> 06:22.017
In 1955,

06:22.975 --> 06:33.404
because I wanted to work in cotton, and I was still a graduate student, but I went to the meeting as a means to get acquainted and let people know I was looking for a job.

06:35.266 --> 06:48.598
And that did help me with a job in Missouri, but in the process of that, I got acquainted with several people from Texas A&M, because they had a large group of people involved in cotton, as you might expect.

06:49.899 --> 06:52.341
And in 19...

06:53.367 --> 07:10.944
at that Cotton meeting, I was approached by a member of the faculty here named James Berzell, who had just come here about a year earlier from LSU.

07:11.244 --> 07:16.630
He had actually done his degree here, his PhD, but he was from LSU, Louisiana.

07:16.730 --> 07:22.075
And Jim Berzell said that a faculty member here had recently quit

07:22.966 --> 07:26.591
to go with industry and they had an opening, would I be interested?

07:27.552 --> 07:32.299
If so, he would say something to the head department, who was Dr. J.C.

07:32.359 --> 07:32.740
Gaines.

07:34.022 --> 07:38.648
So I said, yeah, I'm at a field station.

07:39.589 --> 07:47.100
It's very, what we can do is going to be very limited and I would certainly be interested in getting on campus.

07:47.080 --> 07:59.304
And I'd never been to Texas A&M, but I knew about them from the Southwest Conference, football and athletics, because Arkansas, University of Arkansas was in the conference.

07:59.324 --> 08:06.979
But anyway, so I, at that meeting, met with Dr. Gaines.

08:09.322 --> 08:31.792
And he said, yeah, we got an opening and I've heard good things about you from people at the University of Arkansas and I've seen you here, heard you make your presentation and all, so I think you'd fit in well with our group if you have an interest.

08:31.813 --> 08:33.675
Would you like to come down and interview?

08:35.039 --> 08:39.569
Well, my wife was like eight months, seven months pregnant.

08:40.912 --> 08:49.250
And I said, well, yeah, I would like to, but I'd have to talk to my wife because she is pregnant.

08:49.271 --> 08:54.482
And our job, we only live about 80 or 90 miles from where we grew up.

08:56.470 --> 09:04.892
And she'd have to be agreeable, but she said, you know, if that's where you need to go for your career, then let's go.

09:05.012 --> 09:09.443
I'm not tied home.

09:09.464 --> 09:13.534
So I said, well, let's get in the car and drive to Texas A&M.

09:15.860 --> 09:21.528
And so I called Dr. Gaines and said, well, we're interested and would like to come down.

09:21.689 --> 09:25.975
And this was getting in the Christmas holidays.

09:26.195 --> 09:38.914
And so shortly after the holiday, early January, Francis and I drove down here.

09:40.598 --> 09:59.558
We stayed at the Sands Hotel, and meantime, University of Missouri had learned that I was coming and made me a counteroffer before I even got an offer, that we want you to stay and we'll match or beat anything A&M to do.

09:59.578 --> 10:07.686
And I said, well, I really didn't want to get in the bidding game, but anyway, it's nice to know you're wanted.

10:09.252 --> 10:15.400
I remember getting up that morning and had an appointment at like 8.30 or something over here.

10:16.942 --> 10:18.184
And I had to find where to go.

10:19.105 --> 10:30.240
And we were staying in the Sands Hotel and I said to Francis, I said, you know, I really like all the people I'm working with at the University of Missouri and they really treated me nice.

10:30.360 --> 10:35.867
I'm just about ready to just get in the car and let's just go home and forget this deal.

10:37.703 --> 10:43.830
So she said, well, if that's what you want to do, but you've driven a long ways, not to even say hello.

10:44.190 --> 10:47.254
So I said, well, you're right.

10:47.994 --> 10:54.121
It wouldn't be courteous or polite to drive this far and then just cancel out.

10:57.365 --> 11:00.268
That wouldn't be the right thing to do.

11:00.248 --> 11:13.141
So I came on over here and within an hour of seeing the facilities and walking around meeting people, I knew that this is where I ought to come if I would get an offer.

11:14.262 --> 11:21.970
So I spent a day and a half here and had the interview with Dr. Lewis, R.D.

11:21.990 --> 11:26.695
Lewis, who was director, dean and director of the experiment station.

11:28.261 --> 11:33.571
And in those days, they didn't have a lot of faculty.

11:33.591 --> 11:35.315
They didn't have any faculty search committees.

11:35.355 --> 11:45.034
Department head pretty much made the decision because he would, I'm sure, talk with some of the senior profs if he was astute department head.

11:46.537 --> 11:50.404
But anyway,

11:51.920 --> 12:08.578
I've made the rounds and Gaines told me, he said, well, I can't make you an offer today because I have to have it approved by Dr. Lewis, but I'll call you in a day or two and as far as I'm concerned, if you want the job, we'd like to have you.

12:11.157 --> 12:17.089
So he said, you need to think about what you want, what, you know.

12:17.109 --> 12:25.145
So he called me in a day or two and made me an offer.

12:25.165 --> 12:32.018
And it was not quite as much as University of Missouri had offered me to stay.

12:32.572 --> 12:50.452
So I said, well, Dr. Gaines, I don't want to get in the bidding business, but the University of Missouri, the people, Dr. Stallman, the department head, knew I was coming and they've called and they've offered me $500 a year more than you've offered A&M.

12:50.472 --> 13:01.465
But I'll tell you what, I'll take the salary that you've offered, but I now have two years experience and I've published

13:01.445 --> 13:08.482
eight or ten papers, so what I want in lieu of $500 is an associate professor.

13:10.266 --> 13:15.538
If you'll give me an associate professor, then it's a deal.

13:17.273 --> 13:18.835
He said, well, I think I can do that.

13:19.556 --> 13:22.739
If you've got 10 papers, you can do it.

13:22.900 --> 13:23.340
We'll do it.

13:23.360 --> 13:25.022
And I said, well, I've got 11 or 12.

13:26.924 --> 13:28.526
So that's my deal.

13:28.546 --> 13:31.590
So I came down here as an associate professor.

13:32.871 --> 13:37.237
And I think it was $8,000 a year.

13:37.337 --> 13:38.598
I can't remember for sure.

13:38.718 --> 13:46.808
But anyway, I had been making more than that in three months at the Helms Planning Company.

13:46.788 --> 13:54.838
But in those days, it was a pretty good salary for a beginning professorship in entomology.

13:54.858 --> 13:56.461
And it was the right decision.

13:56.601 --> 14:01.988
I absolutely made the right decision professionally.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.651
And so you arrived to begin your profession?

14:04.671 --> 14:09.117
I started work here on the first day of February, 1958.

14:09.805 --> 14:13.736
And I was hired about the middle of January.

14:13.756 --> 14:16.063
Oh, so you were, you came quickly.

14:17.005 --> 14:18.329
Yeah, yeah.

14:18.349 --> 14:22.581
Describe the, was it a department then, a separate department?

14:22.621 --> 14:24.827
Yeah, yeah.

14:24.807 --> 14:27.010
You ought to know your history.

14:27.050 --> 14:46.798
Entomology department here was created in 1899 when the boll weevil invaded Texas from Mexico in 1892 or three and shortly after that the legislature instructed

14:46.778 --> 14:54.193
Texas A&M University to hire an entomologist to eradicate the boll weevil and appropriated the sum of $5,000.

14:54.213 --> 15:02.710
And that created the department and the first entomologist here was a fellow named Fred Malley.

15:04.073 --> 15:05.195
How do you spell that?

15:05.216 --> 15:06.458
M-A-L-L-E-Y.

15:07.855 --> 15:20.634
And I told people after I was head of the department, we're still trying to eradicate the boll weevil, and our budget's not much bigger than the original $5,000 appropriation, but anyway.

15:21.135 --> 15:22.777
Describe the department when you got here.

15:22.917 --> 15:23.578
How many?

15:23.638 --> 15:27.003
Well, let me see.

15:27.043 --> 15:32.952
I came in 1958, and

15:32.932 --> 15:35.655
The department at that time was pretty small.

15:35.675 --> 15:46.489
It had a fairly, had about as many USDA people in the department as faculty.

15:46.509 --> 15:51.435
It had a core faculty of three or four people who did most of the undergraduate teaching.

15:52.797 --> 16:00.947
And most of the faculty were former students at A&M.

16:01.214 --> 16:30.107
maybe half of them just had a master's degree they were great teachers and they were good people but they weren't highly trained in some cases so the department was pretty much what was in those days called a squirt and spray squirt and count department they were most of the research revolved around testing insecticides it was a time DDT had been on the scene right after World War II when we get a lot of

16:30.880 --> 16:42.535
These new insecticides that people had never seen before that were highly effective and you couldn't, for the first time, really control insects in the field.

16:42.555 --> 16:51.707
So at the time I came, it was a year or so, about a year before I came, the boll weevil became resistant

16:52.632 --> 17:03.636
to chlorinated hydrocarbons, the DDT type classes, not DDT itself because DDT was not effective against the bull weevil, but those kind of materials.

17:03.656 --> 17:11.333
And it created sort of a panic and because people had been getting almost 100% control and all of a sudden you can't control worse pests than cotton.

17:11.313 --> 17:13.756
and we were having a lot of losses.

17:14.917 --> 17:32.358
And as a result of that, Dr. Lewis had been able to get a corporation from the experiment, for the experiment station from the legislature to begin to do basic research on cotton insects.

17:32.378 --> 17:40.628
And one of the position I came into was an existing position, but they switched it around some, and one Brazil came into.

17:40.608 --> 17:56.022
We were both PhDs and we were hired to do basic research on cotton problems to try to find alternative methods for control and so forth.

17:56.082 --> 18:05.291
So we were in a new wave of the different kind of person in the department.

18:05.311 --> 18:07.493
At the same time, the USDA

18:07.473 --> 18:09.495
did the same thing.

18:09.595 --> 18:23.290
They brought in three PhDs to work on the boll weevil problem, and they were people who were trained in a different method from other universities.

18:23.310 --> 18:30.358
And so there was about five of us that were really involved in changing the research direction.

18:30.524 --> 18:39.014
Was there a team leader, anyone who was responsible, was the key head of the cotton research?

18:40.375 --> 18:40.615
No.

18:41.236 --> 18:51.047
We all had our own individual projects and the department head that delineated responsibilities at that time.

18:52.188 --> 18:58.135
As it turned out, I came and my primary responsibility, in fact, was work on the pink bull worm.

18:58.115 --> 19:03.763
and Jim Burzell was to work on other continent insects.

19:03.823 --> 19:06.306
Now, did you pick that, or were you assigned?

19:06.326 --> 19:07.648
No, I was assigned that.

19:08.329 --> 19:10.732
Were you replacing someone?

19:11.032 --> 19:18.603
I was replacing a person named Bill McGee, who had his PhD from here.

19:18.963 --> 19:22.688
His father, in fact, was a professor in the ag-eco department.

19:22.668 --> 19:37.973
And I took over Bill McGee's projects, but within a year or two, we had developed a program that pretty much eliminated the pink bull worm by non-chemical means.

19:39.035 --> 19:45.165
And as a result, I'd worked myself out of a job.

19:45.145 --> 19:46.748
Describe how you did that.

19:47.148 --> 19:51.816
Well, I didn't do it myself, but I was part of a group.

19:51.836 --> 20:08.322
We had several USDA people in Brownsville, but what we did is develop a program based on uniform planning dates and time of planning and assault destruction.

20:09.143 --> 20:10.545
Texas had a law to

20:10.525 --> 20:18.274
mandate stalk destruction and try to get the residue out so you eliminate the overwintering population pretty much.

20:19.553 --> 20:24.420
But nobody had put it into a program.

20:25.381 --> 20:31.150
And at the point when I came, people hadn't evaluated how successful that might be.

20:32.191 --> 20:40.583
So I came at a point that it was sort of putting together a program based primarily on other people's research.

20:41.710 --> 20:54.667
and then evaluate it by some statistical methods that people who were involved had not used before.

20:55.288 --> 20:58.331
Geographically, where did y'all do the field work?

20:59.393 --> 21:01.616
Well, all over, all over Texas.

21:02.697 --> 21:08.865
The peak bollworm was more of a problem in south Texas and out in the El Paso area.

21:09.487 --> 21:16.071
But I did research in El Paso from here and in the Rio Grande Valley and, of course, locally.

21:16.675 --> 21:19.940
When did you begin to realize it was succeeding?

21:19.960 --> 21:20.441
How long?

21:22.184 --> 21:23.486
Oh, within a year.

21:24.147 --> 21:33.062
Within a year, I could see from what we were doing in field plots and large areas that we had a program that would do that.

21:34.003 --> 21:40.033
So in, like, 1959, I wrote a bulletin on it.

21:40.013 --> 21:44.000
integrated control of the pink bullworm.

21:44.020 --> 21:50.551
I guess it was the first integrated control bulletin that was ever well done out of the entomology department here.

21:52.254 --> 22:00.688
And I was doing quite a bit of basic research on the pink bullworm on particularly on the

22:02.947 --> 22:07.218
mechanism which had overwintered, had become dormant.

22:07.238 --> 22:10.728
And insects go into a stage called diapause.

22:10.788 --> 22:18.087
It's a dormant stage which are, they don't require any food or water or, and they're highly resistant to cold.

22:19.923 --> 22:34.623
And so I was doing work on dormancy and on the fact of day length and controlling dormancy, which was, anyway, a new discovery.

22:35.945 --> 22:48.462
And in the process of that work, some of my publications came to the attention of a person at Harvard named Carol Williams.

22:50.939 --> 22:58.430
And Carroll was one of the top two insect physiologists in the world at the time.

23:00.093 --> 23:09.507
He and a person in England named Wigglesworth, Vincent Wigglesworth, were the supreme authorities.

23:10.168 --> 23:13.673
They were two people above everybody.

23:15.239 --> 23:21.947
So my work had come to the attention of Carroll who had done a lot of work on dormancy.

23:22.508 --> 23:28.134
That was his primary area work in fact.

23:29.616 --> 23:40.048
So I gave a paper in Phoenix, Arizona in entomology meetings I think in the fall of 1961 or,

23:42.475 --> 23:46.665
I guess, the fall of 1961, which Carroll attended.

23:49.112 --> 23:53.683
So he came up to me after the meeting and said, introduced himself.

23:54.997 --> 24:02.387
and said, I would like to come back by Texas A&M on the way back to Harvard and visit with you.

24:03.388 --> 24:05.911
Well, he was a hero, you know.

24:05.991 --> 24:09.776
I thought, God, it's like God had come to see you.

24:10.417 --> 24:21.932
And I said, well, you know, you can come to see me anytime you want, but I'll tell you at the beginning, I'll be ashamed for you to see where my lab is.

24:21.912 --> 24:26.182
and where I'm working, but that's all right.

24:26.202 --> 24:26.784
Come on.

24:26.804 --> 24:32.177
But I'll tell you beforehand, I'm working in an old shed, and I don't have facilities anywhere near.

24:32.257 --> 24:36.748
I'm sure I've never been to Harvard like you're used to.

24:38.315 --> 24:50.639
So I was ashamed for him to come and visit because I had built some labs myself with a couple of graduate students and one of these old Quonset buildings that sat right across.

24:50.680 --> 24:53.645
You may remember where they were.

24:53.665 --> 24:57.994
It was one that sat right on the road, highway here by the railroad.

24:59.965 --> 25:07.166
So Carroll came and visited and he said, well, you've got to get out of this kind of facility.

25:07.187 --> 25:12.743
So you need to come to Harvard and spend a year in my lab.

25:14.326 --> 25:18.792
And I said, well, you know, I'd really like to do that, but I don't know that I can.

25:19.092 --> 25:19.673
I don't know.

25:20.173 --> 25:27.542
First thing is A&M, they don't have a sabbatical lead program, and I don't know whether I could do that.

25:27.562 --> 25:29.204
Well, Carol, you had to know him.

25:29.224 --> 25:34.151
He was a very willful, forceful person.

25:34.171 --> 25:35.652
He said, what's your dean's name?

25:35.733 --> 25:37.334
I said, his name, Harry Kunkel.

25:38.256 --> 25:43.422
He said, well, I'm going to call Harry Kunkel and make an appointment to go see him.

25:45.764 --> 25:50.670
And I said, well, that's up to you, you know.

25:51.031 --> 25:51.612
So he did.

25:51.632 --> 26:03.587
He got on the phone and said, this is Professor Carol Williams from Harvard University, and I'm visiting the entomology department, and I want to come talk to you about one of your profs, young profs.

26:03.607 --> 26:08.433
So he went over and talked to her, and he said, I don't know.

26:08.533 --> 26:11.417
He came back and told me, he said, I told your dean that it was

26:11.752 --> 26:19.349
absolutely shameful for a university of this size to have a person of your talent working in such a crappy place.

26:20.191 --> 26:26.284
And I also told him that I had invited you to come and spend a year in my lab and

26:27.513 --> 26:32.862
Bell went longer that Harry called me and said, what's, you know, what's going on here?

26:32.882 --> 26:39.412
And I said, well, Harry, I didn't have, you know, I didn't, I didn't put Carol Williams up to go.

26:39.933 --> 26:40.955
So I told him the story.

26:41.055 --> 26:45.302
I said, you know, I gave this paper and he had been reading some of my stuff and,

26:45.687 --> 26:55.823
He came to hear my paper, and when he came, he said, I'm coming to A&M to visit with you, and if you don't mind, and I'd like to see what you're doing, I'd like to talk to you.

26:55.843 --> 26:59.349
And after we talked, he invited me to come up.

26:59.369 --> 27:07.041
And then he said he was going to go over and talk to you about the condition of my lab and what kind of facilities I have to work in.

27:07.903 --> 27:13.011
And I said, I thought anything might help, because you know damn well I'm working out here in the old Quonset building that,

27:13.582 --> 27:22.286
It's unsafe and not beneficial to your health, and I'm ashamed for people to know that I work in such a place.

27:22.446 --> 27:29.886
But anyway, as a result of that, I...

27:31.638 --> 27:33.501
Harry said, well, we'd be happy before you go.

27:33.541 --> 27:35.323
I think it'd be a good opportunity for you.

27:36.445 --> 27:43.355
We never, as far as I know, had anybody that ever went from at least from the College of Agriculture to Harvard.

27:43.375 --> 27:51.267
And Harry was a person that really appreciated basic research all his career.

27:52.360 --> 27:55.267
So he said, we can give you leave, but we can't pay your salary.

27:56.550 --> 28:02.544
So you'll have to find, said, can Williams get you some kind of postdoctoral or something?

28:02.745 --> 28:05.070
And I, you know, I don't know.

28:05.391 --> 28:06.133
But anyway.

28:06.468 --> 28:12.276
So I called Carol and said, well, I can get leave, but I can't get salary.

28:12.296 --> 28:26.215
And, you know, I'm married and I just bought a house and I've got a new baby and a wife and I just couldn't come unless I have salary support.

28:27.629 --> 28:31.294
So he said, well, we can't provide you any salary or maintenance.

28:31.354 --> 28:46.493
All I can do is provide you a lab place to work, but why don't you apply for a public health service fellowship?

28:46.693 --> 28:51.679
They've got some traineeships and fellowships, and I'll write you a strong letter

28:53.262 --> 28:55.124
So of support.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.807
So I applied and he did.

28:57.968 --> 29:10.342
And as a result of that, I got what was called a senior postdoctoral fellowship that covered my salary, covered my travel, and a small amount for supplement.

29:10.402 --> 29:18.872
As it turned out, after I got there, the experiment station provided me some funding for supplies and equipment.

29:18.892 --> 29:20.434
But anyway,

29:21.089 --> 29:36.277
That was a turning point in my career because one thing was as far as I know, maybe I was the first person that ever went from A&M to do a postdoc.

29:36.297 --> 29:41.747
I was actually a visiting professor at Harvard and it caught attention to Mr. Rudder.

29:44.478 --> 29:59.854
And I remember that the ceremony is where they were given the awards, former student awards in Guyon Hall that Mr. Rudder would give a little speech and he'd talk about faculty accomplishments.

30:00.914 --> 30:07.947
And he made a, one of the accomplishments he mentioned in that was that I was going to Harvard for a year.

30:09.429 --> 30:22.032
And that didn't hurt anything, I guess, because when I got back, in the meantime, when I was at Harvard University of Missouri, made me a hell of an offer to come back.

30:22.052 --> 30:24.677
So I called Harry and I said, Harry,

30:25.805 --> 30:47.408
I'm going to tell you that I didn't come to Harvard to look for another job, but you know I worked at the University of Missouri before I came, and they've called me, Phil Stone has, and said if I would come to Columbia, he would give me a salary of $15,000.

30:49.042 --> 31:07.500
And I said, you know, I'm making $8,000 at A&M, and I found out that I'm an associate professor at A&M, and I'm working in a lab next to a guy here who's doing a postdoc, University of Texas Department of Biology, and he's making $15,000 as an assistant professor.

31:07.520 --> 31:15.928
So I said, you know, that's an offer I have to consider because they're just doubling my salary.

31:15.948 --> 31:17.209
So he said, well,

31:18.303 --> 31:20.128
Barry, don't you take that offer.
