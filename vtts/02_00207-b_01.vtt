00:02.343 --> 00:14.320
It was not a thing where guys were just, you know, causing any problem.

00:14.340 --> 00:17.164
They were just having a good time, and they'd get happy.

00:17.705 --> 00:21.771
Were those of you who did not drink, were you teased?

00:21.791 --> 00:25.396
Were you held in any kind of disregard, you thought?

00:26.457 --> 00:27.319
I don't think so.

00:28.140 --> 00:30.443
To some extent, we thought we were going to be.

00:30.575 --> 00:37.543
But probably out of our 40 plus freshmen, there was at least 10 of us that band together.

00:38.465 --> 00:48.336
And there were sophomores, juniors, and seniors, also a few who, you know, drank the cold drinks with the rest of us.

00:48.356 --> 00:52.161
And I never felt like that we were

00:53.828 --> 00:59.896
we were considered second race citizens because we didn't drink.

00:59.997 --> 01:02.079
Whiskey was, how common was whiskey?

01:02.580 --> 01:06.225
Wasn't very common, to be honest with you.

01:06.325 --> 01:10.091
It was usually beer, is what most people were drinking.

01:10.111 --> 01:12.314
And beer was available retail?

01:12.534 --> 01:12.774
Yes.

01:14.657 --> 01:17.621
Whiskey Bridge, was it already a reality?

01:17.701 --> 01:17.942
Yes.

01:19.364 --> 01:23.329
And many a time that's where the, you'd have to go across the Brazos River,

01:23.596 --> 01:26.660
out to Whiskey Bridge and that's where the alcohol came from.

01:27.901 --> 01:30.625
Did Aggies keep any alcohol in their rooms?

01:30.645 --> 01:31.065
Not at all.

01:32.427 --> 01:37.313
At least I never knew it because it was a pretty stiff penalty if you got caught with it.

01:38.955 --> 01:41.678
Smoking, how common was that and what did they smoke?

01:43.420 --> 01:47.505
Well, they were mostly cigarette smokers among them.

01:48.547 --> 01:49.307
There was a few.

01:50.769 --> 01:53.012
I think I recall that

01:53.363 --> 01:56.286
One could smoke in your room if you chose to.

01:56.326 --> 02:04.916
One year I had a, my sophomore year, I had a roommate that smoked, but he didn't ever smoke in the room.

02:04.936 --> 02:06.157
And he always wanted to quit.

02:06.998 --> 02:13.685
But his reaction always was, well, it does me more psychological good than physical harm.

02:14.546 --> 02:16.048
And so he always smoked.

02:16.068 --> 02:17.189
Today he does not smoke.

02:18.650 --> 02:20.873
Were there any cigars, pipes?

02:21.413 --> 02:22.915
Yeah, there were cigars.

02:23.266 --> 02:30.439
Big deal at the Dunkin' Dining Hall after a Thanksgiving meal, Christmas meal, they'd break out the cigars.

02:30.980 --> 02:33.966
And everybody was given a cigar to smoke if they wanted to.

02:35.188 --> 02:39.456
And, you know, it was stifling to see all the cigars that were being smoked.

02:39.476 --> 02:40.879
Even freshmen got smoked cigars.

02:42.983 --> 02:44.886
Nobody, no student smoked a pipe.

02:46.064 --> 02:51.273
I remember one or two that in their room they smoked a pipe.

02:51.773 --> 02:55.540
Chewing tobacco or snuff?

02:55.560 --> 02:57.122
Wasn't very prevalent in those days.

02:58.184 --> 03:01.850
What did, what in your era, how common were drugs?

03:02.651 --> 03:03.974
Didn't even know they existed.

03:04.815 --> 03:06.237
Had you even heard the words?

03:06.357 --> 03:07.920
Nope, never heard it.

03:09.301 --> 03:21.152
And of course, nobody, heroin, cocaine and all that was totally... That was totally foreign to all of us.

03:22.213 --> 03:32.823
Now, where was there, if a group of guys wanted to just go have a big time on Saturday night, other than the clay pits, where else would they have gone?

03:35.966 --> 03:38.548
There was a place out here called Fort Shiloh.

03:39.963 --> 03:45.609
that was kind of an old church building that had been made into a honky tonk.

03:45.629 --> 03:48.352
And it was a place to go.

03:50.554 --> 03:51.034
Where was it?

03:51.655 --> 03:57.321
It was in College Station out to Highway 6 on the right.

03:58.101 --> 03:58.202
Okay.

03:58.222 --> 04:00.444
It's about where old Fort Shiloh is today.

04:01.145 --> 04:01.345
All right.

04:01.365 --> 04:03.106
Was Uncle Ed still going?

04:03.307 --> 04:04.128
Yes, it was.

04:04.348 --> 04:05.089
Describe it.

04:06.630 --> 04:08.552
And about where was it?

04:08.701 --> 04:28.888
It was out toward the Brazos River, as I recall, and it was basically just a eating place and beer joint, and I remember they had tables and chairs outside, and I can honestly say I never went there.

04:29.990 --> 04:33.394
It just wasn't a place that was appealing to me at all.

04:33.655 --> 04:36.919
How often did you and your buddies go to something in downtown Bryan?

04:38.755 --> 04:46.773
We might go to a movie at the Palace Theater, you know, two or three times a month.

04:49.098 --> 04:51.142
That was not uncommon.

04:51.904 --> 04:56.815
And if any of you had an out-of-town date, where did she stay?

04:57.993 --> 05:06.707
Well, the out-of-town dates I had usually stayed with some of the church members that we knew through our congregation.

05:08.890 --> 05:14.539
There were others that occasionally would stay with faculty members in their homes.

05:15.821 --> 05:24.996
And then there were times when a big event came and they would even vacate part of a dorm and put the coeds in there.

05:26.579 --> 05:30.144
At social events where there were lots of dates, how were the women treated?

05:32.087 --> 05:32.687
Very well.

05:36.653 --> 05:47.728
Describe some of those big social events, freshman dance, the freshman ball, a cotton ball, a ring dance, and so forth.

05:48.789 --> 05:52.134
Those were always very special, special affairs.

05:53.216 --> 05:55.759
And as odd as this may sound,

05:57.224 --> 06:22.499
One of the greatest quirks of my memory is when they redid the restrooms at Cebesa and designed some facilities that women could use wearing long skirts, big full skirts.

06:23.200 --> 06:26.505
Now that's weird, but it was the talk of the campus.

06:27.481 --> 06:31.067
that they have these unique facilities for women.

06:31.948 --> 06:36.675
And so when they'd have the big dance and the women were here, it was unbelievable.

06:37.817 --> 06:42.745
Now, how I would remember that at this point in life, it just seems very strange.

06:42.825 --> 06:54.383
But as you well know, in that day and age, if it was all male military, facilities for women were very sparse, very sparse.

06:54.751 --> 06:55.732
most anywhere you went.

06:56.873 --> 07:03.501
And did the average undergraduate male attend a lot of those big?

07:03.982 --> 07:05.083
Oh no, oh no.

07:07.906 --> 07:11.130
Those were juniors and seniors more often than not.

07:11.230 --> 07:17.437
Now if you had the special freshman ball or the sophomore ball, everybody went.

07:18.458 --> 07:18.919
But

07:19.253 --> 07:27.025
Big events, big formal dances, if you brought in a big band, all of that, the majority of those would be juniors and seniors.

07:27.726 --> 07:29.909
Do you remember going as a junior and senior?

07:32.734 --> 07:38.803
I really don't because I was not a dancer as such.

07:40.385 --> 07:45.413
I went to some of the banquets we had, and many times the dance would follow that.

07:46.287 --> 07:50.952
Let's not say I never went to a dance, but I did a time or two my freshman year, I think.

07:51.732 --> 07:55.416
But it was usually just to see who was there and what was going on.

07:55.857 --> 07:57.338
Do you remember some of the big bands?

07:58.579 --> 08:00.802
Yeah.

08:00.882 --> 08:05.326
Les Brown and his band of renown was one of them.

08:05.346 --> 08:08.549
Guy Lombardo, I believe, came.

08:08.630 --> 08:10.331
Now, he may have been Town Hall.

08:10.652 --> 08:12.393
Well, but, no, I just mean to the campus.

08:12.413 --> 08:15.096
These were big bands that came in.

08:16.122 --> 08:20.027
Who were some other celebrity?

08:20.127 --> 08:26.615
Well Elvis Presley came and when he started his career he had an appearance here.

08:26.655 --> 08:29.539
Nat King Cole was one I remember vividly.

08:30.680 --> 08:33.864
I think Tony Bennett was here on one occasion.

08:36.628 --> 08:41.253
Sons of the Pioneers and people like that that were here.

08:41.654 --> 08:43.236
Did you by chance go see Elvis?

08:43.596 --> 08:43.937
Oh yes.

08:44.157 --> 08:44.998
What was your impression?

08:45.907 --> 09:11.205
well he was just sort of a greasy kid that you know you thought he's here today and gone tomorrow uh that that basically was it but town hall was a big event uh everybody went to town hall were there some other celebrity speakers or politicians you remember during your undergraduate days i don't know that i remember

09:11.692 --> 09:16.438
any outstanding speakers that made a great impression on me.

09:17.439 --> 09:18.640
I really don't.

09:18.761 --> 09:19.902
No military heroes?

09:20.763 --> 09:22.025
No, I don't recall.

09:25.349 --> 09:32.697
Let's see, who were some of the celebrity students that were here, people that were a lot of notoriety?

09:32.717 --> 09:34.660
There were a few football players, weren't there?

09:35.241 --> 09:36.622
What did you all think about those?

09:36.642 --> 09:41.428
Well, of course, when Bear Bryant came,

09:42.269 --> 09:46.973
here in 54, 55, which was my freshman year.

09:48.414 --> 10:10.234
He was, I still remember the first night he was here at Yale practice, walked up on the stage at the Grove, and he took his coat off and rolled his sleeves up and talked about the winning program he was going to build, and the place just went wild, and he introduced some of his players, and of course, John David Crowe was one of the big names

10:10.855 --> 10:12.337
that everybody knew about.

10:12.897 --> 10:31.016
Kenneth Hall, Charlie Kruger, a guy from Kentucky by the name of Tracy, John Tracy, and Jack Pardee, of course, was already established as a football player.

10:31.297 --> 10:34.380
Gene Stallings.

10:34.540 --> 10:35.361
It was amazing.

10:35.645 --> 10:39.529
how many good athletes we had at that time.

10:40.009 --> 10:42.752
What did you students think about Bear Bryant?

10:43.873 --> 10:46.736
Well, we wanted to win.

10:47.798 --> 10:54.504
And we felt like that he was going to be the answer to our desire to win.

10:54.905 --> 10:59.570
And of course, our freshman year, we won one, the team won one game and lost nine.

11:00.531 --> 11:02.833
And the only game I missed was the one in Maryland.

11:04.248 --> 11:07.573
because I liked football and I went to the games.

11:07.653 --> 11:09.997
I had seen them at Juncture and I wanted to see them do well.

11:12.281 --> 11:18.370
Did you all see many of those star football players in classes, in the hallways?

11:18.511 --> 11:20.414
Were they really part of the student body?

11:21.395 --> 11:22.958
To some degree they were.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.663
They were to wear uniforms just like the rest of us.

11:27.625 --> 11:30.209
And they were the sloppiest cadets that existed.

11:31.371 --> 11:32.112
They got out of

11:32.446 --> 11:36.012
out of Thursday afternoon drill because they had football practice.

11:37.355 --> 11:53.965
I remember they weren't always the most studious and I didn't have an appreciation then of why they weren't, but if you'd worked yourself physically to where you were just worn out,

11:54.282 --> 11:57.907
It was hard to get in class and stay awake.

11:57.927 --> 12:06.379
Were there supposedly then, as far as you students knew, were there any E, any cush courses for athletes?

12:06.399 --> 12:08.543
Yeah, there were.

12:10.065 --> 12:19.538
There was one gentleman here that was known as Cigar Dan, the grade point man, sociology classes, and they always seemed to gravitate to his.

12:21.501 --> 12:22.703
There was a required

12:23.122 --> 12:26.626
economics course that I remember the funny incident in.

12:26.666 --> 12:35.636
And it was my sophomore year, but there was a gentleman teaching this class who was hard hearing.

12:37.398 --> 12:43.285
And he had one of these over the head, you know, hearing aids with a little deal in his pocket.

12:45.567 --> 12:50.513
And I noticed when I went in to take the class, there was a lot of athletes in there.

12:51.286 --> 12:57.715
And it was unusual that there would be so many athletes taking this course in economics.

12:59.517 --> 13:06.226
Well, about the time that we were to have our first major exam, Dr. Adams is who this gentleman was.

13:08.189 --> 13:15.378
And all of a sudden, the athletes would come in and they'd start talking to Dr. Adams real loud.

13:17.521 --> 13:20.365
And the first thing you know, he would turn his hearing aid down.

13:22.218 --> 13:28.305
And then when it came time to take the test, they would say, Charlie, what you got on number two?

13:29.527 --> 13:31.709
And they just all took the test together.

13:34.292 --> 13:39.879
And there was always some of them that knew what was going on and they made, you know, they had some help and they did a good job.

13:40.740 --> 13:48.069
Well, as fate would have it, Dr. Adams got sick and died.

13:49.090 --> 13:50.892
And we had another prof come in

13:51.243 --> 13:52.545
who was not hard-hearing.

13:53.307 --> 13:55.611
And, of course, you know what happened to all the athletes.

13:56.954 --> 14:00.340
I shouldn't say all of them, but many of them.

14:00.360 --> 14:06.973
And I was happy that I made a C, at least in the course, as I best recall.

14:07.460 --> 14:10.845
There was always a few shenanigans like that that went on.

14:11.626 --> 14:19.719
Now, were there some athletes that you and your fellow students knew were good, that these athletes were good students?

14:19.819 --> 14:20.139
Oh, yes.

14:20.720 --> 14:26.329
There were always some that they were there, did their work.

14:28.432 --> 14:35.543
But because of my longstanding friendship with a lot of these athletes from Junction,

14:36.518 --> 14:41.285
I found out that they had tutors available for them over at Walton Hall.

14:42.466 --> 14:48.255
And so a lot of times when there was a big exam coming up, I'd go over and study with them and take advantage of tutors.

14:48.856 --> 14:49.717
It was not illegal.

14:49.737 --> 14:50.798
There was nothing wrong with it.

14:51.459 --> 14:53.642
They helped us get ready for tests.

14:54.724 --> 14:56.026
And so I always remembered.

14:56.907 --> 15:02.475
Then the quiz files we all had, oh, they were wonderful.

15:03.417 --> 15:08.521
And the profs would say, now you guys take these tests and put them in your quiz files.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.563
It was not that they didn't want us to have them.

15:10.603 --> 15:12.905
They wanted us to have them.

15:12.925 --> 15:16.949
The tests were always different, most of the time anyway.

15:17.589 --> 15:18.630
There was one exception.

15:20.352 --> 15:24.435
In my freshman year, I was taking history under Dr. Nance.

15:25.496 --> 15:29.279
He was very affectionately known as Notes Nance.

15:29.300 --> 15:33.323
And if you broke your pencil lead, you were behind a paragraph or two.

15:35.159 --> 15:41.109
We were studying for the final exam in history 106.

15:41.429 --> 15:42.391
No, it was 105.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.154
Maybe it was 105 or six.

15:44.174 --> 15:45.877
Five is the first semester, six is the second.

15:45.897 --> 15:47.860
It was six, the second semester.

15:49.262 --> 15:55.673
And there was three different sections within the guys in my outfit, freshmen.

15:55.693 --> 15:58.618
And so we'd study together to get ready for the finals.

15:59.847 --> 16:07.616
Well, we got in there, and there was about seven different final exams in the file.

16:07.636 --> 16:13.503
And we didn't realize it, but Dr. Nance used some of those tests occasionally verbatim.

16:14.644 --> 16:15.886
He would not change them.

16:17.508 --> 16:23.835
And so the first group went to class and took their exam, and they came back and said, he used this exam.

16:25.798 --> 16:27.880
So we'd rule that out for the next group.

16:29.699 --> 16:34.366
By the time we got to the third group, we knew which exam he was going to give.

16:35.788 --> 16:39.534
And so there were, I think, four of us in that section.

16:40.896 --> 16:45.082
And so we made a pact and said, let's don't all make 100.

16:46.124 --> 16:49.088
If we all make 100, it's going to be, it'll look bad.

16:50.490 --> 16:53.635
Well, we got in there and, of course, it was the same exam.

16:53.775 --> 16:56.179
Now, the beautiful thing was I knew the material.

16:56.902 --> 16:59.185
It wasn't a matter of knowing the answers.

16:59.386 --> 17:00.467
I knew the material.

17:01.549 --> 17:06.416
And so we're sitting there, and I just, and I got to looking at my grades.

17:08.539 --> 17:13.847
And in order to make a B in that history class, I had to have 100.

17:15.550 --> 17:19.255
So I just violated the code a little bit and went ahead and made 100.

17:19.395 --> 17:20.858
I was one of the four that made 100.

17:22.420 --> 17:24.844
And I told the guys later, and they weren't mad.

17:24.944 --> 17:25.845
They said, that's fine.

17:26.618 --> 17:29.401
But I had an extra point or two by making 100.

17:29.581 --> 17:36.770
Describe, other than the notes part, describe Dr. Nance as a teacher, as a lecturer.

17:37.671 --> 17:46.921
Dr. Nance was a, he was a very knowledgeable historian, as I recall.

17:47.922 --> 17:55.731
I thought I knew some history from high school, but I didn't know anything compared to what he knew and the detail he would give you.

17:56.808 --> 18:08.244
And he had the reputation, because of Notes Nance, is that you didn't fall asleep if you took notes in his class.

18:08.284 --> 18:10.828
You would just be so hard pressed to get it all down.

18:12.490 --> 18:21.803
But one of the funny things was one of the guys that was a sophomore our freshman year, he said, well, I guess you guys all know how Dr. Nance grades.

18:22.171 --> 18:23.572
And we said, what's that?

18:23.612 --> 18:29.277
He said, well, he staples your papers together, gets at the top of the stairs, and throws them down.

18:30.078 --> 18:38.606
And whoever has the heaviest paper, it'll go the furthest, so you get an A. And after that, we realized that he was a man that liked detail.

18:39.907 --> 18:43.230
And I found him to be fair, but he was hard.

18:45.452 --> 18:48.875
Wasn't the most entertaining lecturer either.

18:48.975 --> 18:50.997
He was pretty dull, to be honest with you.

18:52.664 --> 18:58.890
Other interesting teachers you recall that you haven't mentioned already?

18:59.451 --> 19:05.397
Well, I mentioned Herb Thompson, but I've got to tell you one more story about Herb Thompson, marketing professor.

19:06.919 --> 19:15.307
Herb Thompson taught a retailing class one time and he told us how to pick out clothes off the rack that were on special.

19:16.729 --> 19:20.933
You might go to a big men's store and it says sale.

19:21.757 --> 19:31.290
clothes from $39.95 to $99.95, all for $35 or whatever the price was.

19:32.612 --> 19:42.646
And Herb brought a suit to class, some suits, and he taught us how to look at the seams and the stitching.

19:43.186 --> 19:50.937
And he said the difference between a $100 suit and a $50 suit is how they're put together.

19:52.132 --> 19:54.335
and the amount of thread used to build them.

19:55.637 --> 20:01.406
And he said, you go to that rack, find one, and then start checking it, and you'll know how to buy a good suit.

20:02.187 --> 20:04.831
And I, to this day, have always remembered Herb Thompson.

20:05.813 --> 20:07.536
He had a great sense of humor also.

20:10.340 --> 20:10.781
Let's see.

20:11.101 --> 20:20.215
One other prof, though, that I remember well was

20:20.532 --> 20:24.898
one of our English profs we had, and that was Dr. John Paul Abbott.

20:26.641 --> 20:32.129
He was a man that you just enjoyed being in class with because he just loved life.

20:33.250 --> 20:34.492
And then Dr. C.C.

20:34.512 --> 20:40.420
Dokes, who taught biology, was just, they were excellent teachers.

20:41.302 --> 20:43.705
By and large, I think all my teachers were good.

20:44.832 --> 20:46.824
Let's see, was Doak C-Square?

20:47.126 --> 20:48.414
Oh, yeah, C-Square.

20:48.938 --> 20:51.433
Did Dr. Abbott have a nickname?

20:52.595 --> 20:54.437
I do not recall a nickname for him.

20:54.458 --> 20:55.038
I don't either.

20:55.279 --> 20:56.260
I don't?

20:56.280 --> 20:57.381
I don't remember him.

20:57.822 --> 21:02.148
Happy Harry Hearth and Bloody Morgan, but I don't remember.

21:02.729 --> 21:02.969
Yeah.

21:03.009 --> 21:04.992
I don't remember one.

21:06.414 --> 21:06.734
Let's see.

21:07.615 --> 21:09.818
Major off-campus events.

21:10.519 --> 21:14.404
There were no catastrophes, tragedies on campus.

21:15.045 --> 21:18.310
What off-campus and or world events do you remember?

21:18.550 --> 21:21.454
No Pearl Harbor, no presidential assassination?

21:27.965 --> 21:37.978
Well, I recall that sometime during this era, we got into real competition with the Russians over Sputnik.

21:39.920 --> 21:48.631
And science and math became very important in the educational structure of America.

21:49.372 --> 21:54.078
And so there was a lot of emphasis placed on that.

21:54.098 --> 21:57.162
And that's the best I remember right now.

21:58.508 --> 22:11.523
As you and your buddies were realizing you were heading toward commencement, Vietnam wasn't yet hanging over you and the Korean War was ended.

22:12.224 --> 22:16.990
Were there any international threats that you all feared that might involve?

22:18.091 --> 22:23.477
Well, actually the Korean conflict, as they called it, was still looming.

22:25.239 --> 22:27.402
And it was still an occasion where

22:27.803 --> 22:33.375
guys were going into the service concerned that that's where they were going to wind up.

22:34.577 --> 22:42.775
My senior year, it did wind down, and they backed off the draft and reclassified a lot of people and all of that.

22:44.189 --> 23:10.517
Interestingly enough, just so you set the record straight here, I was going to summer camp at the end of my junior year and I was going to take my pre-camp physical and they discovered I had a hernia from playing flag football and took my contract, my commission away from me, my contract.

23:12.050 --> 23:18.661
I'll never forget Colonel Dittman said, well, if you get that hernia repaired, you can come back.

23:19.222 --> 23:24.550
If you pass the physical your senior year, then you can go to summer camp after your senior year.

23:26.213 --> 23:27.775
Well, strange turn of events.

23:28.216 --> 23:34.186
I had that hernia repaired that summer at the South Plains Hospital in Lubbock.

23:34.206 --> 23:36.910
My dad's insurance was wearing out, running out.

23:37.598 --> 23:43.764
So I had my tonsils out and a hernia repaired at the same time and then came back to summer school.

23:44.044 --> 23:45.906
And that's when I met my wife.

23:48.068 --> 23:57.198
I decided then that being, I marched around the last time for core review, final review, got to wear my senior boots, had a pair, all that.

23:58.339 --> 24:07.588
But I decided that to be in the category one contract that I had with the Air Force as a pilot, I had to commit five years minimum.

24:09.307 --> 24:12.691
And I had fallen in love by that time.

24:14.914 --> 24:21.802
And so Joanne and I were thinking of marriage, and I decided that I was not going to get back in the Corps my senior year.

24:22.963 --> 24:34.477
Well, Colonel Dittman was so mad that I didn't get back in that he called my draft board in Jayden, Texas, and told them to put me at the head of the list.

24:35.819 --> 24:38.402
Well, I was due to graduate in January,

24:39.091 --> 24:43.878
And in late October, I got my notice to report in five days.

24:45.320 --> 24:51.009
I called the draft board lady and said to her that I wanted a deferment to finish school.

24:52.751 --> 24:54.133
And she said, well, we can do that.

24:55.495 --> 24:59.281
And she said, has anything else changed about your situation?

24:59.401 --> 25:04.689
I said, well, Mrs. Johnston, or Mrs. Mary Johnson was her name, Mary Johnson.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.613
She said, I said, I'm married.

25:08.183 --> 25:09.444
She said, well, when did you marry?

25:09.464 --> 25:11.526
And I said, well, this last January.

25:12.487 --> 25:19.034
She said, well, send us in a copy of your wedding marriage license and we're going to reclassify you.

25:19.054 --> 25:24.620
So I never did wind up getting in the Korean conflict because of that or getting the service.

25:26.201 --> 25:32.908
During your student days, what were the major traditions that you Aggie students celebrated?

25:34.576 --> 25:38.781
Well, of course, muster was always very important.

25:40.423 --> 25:44.447
I remember musters on the grass out in front of the Memorial Student Center.

25:48.572 --> 25:49.553
The bonfire.

25:49.753 --> 25:51.415
Let's stay with muster a second.

25:51.475 --> 25:51.636
Okay.

25:51.796 --> 25:54.459
What happened at those musters?

25:54.559 --> 25:55.560
Was there a speaker?

25:55.580 --> 25:57.482
Yes, there was nearly always a speaker.

25:58.684 --> 25:59.925
The 21-gun salute.

26:01.019 --> 26:04.144
There was not candle lighting as we know it today.

26:04.404 --> 26:06.027
Was the muster red?

26:07.049 --> 26:09.973
Yes, the muster story was red.

26:11.055 --> 26:15.482
But was the list called, the muster called?

26:15.502 --> 26:17.185
It was, the names of those.

26:17.425 --> 26:18.206
And who attended?

26:19.508 --> 26:20.430
Well, all the students.

26:21.151 --> 26:23.434
It was basically a student affair.

26:24.616 --> 26:28.242
I guess we weren't knowledgeable enough to know that there were a lot of former students.

26:28.947 --> 26:31.329
and others that were there as well.

26:32.591 --> 26:36.134
And this was held soon after dinner, after supper?

26:36.235 --> 26:37.115
Yes.

26:37.135 --> 26:39.738
Yes, usually at 5.30, 5 in the evening something.

26:39.918 --> 26:42.301
No, it was before the evening meal.

26:42.441 --> 26:43.722
Oh, before the evening.

26:43.742 --> 26:44.163
Yes.

26:44.183 --> 26:47.166
And how did you and your buddies feel about muster?

26:47.226 --> 26:48.948
What did that seem to?

26:49.628 --> 26:55.174
Well, the first time out, I don't know, it was just an event.

26:56.993 --> 27:02.688
And after you've attended your first muster, then you begin to realize what it's about.

27:04.032 --> 27:12.555
And by the time you've done that four years in a row, you have a feeling of what this sense of tradition was all about.

27:14.240 --> 27:25.011
As I've asked people of earlier generations at A&M, almost none of them remember going to a muster on campus before World War II.

27:26.913 --> 27:38.706
That in terms of their memories, it is World War II and the reality and the legend of the Philippine, of the Corregidor, that really changes things.

27:38.726 --> 27:42.610
Okay, other traditional events.

27:42.809 --> 27:46.775
Well, of course, bonfire was a very big event.

27:46.795 --> 27:48.117
Do you remember your freshman year?

27:48.137 --> 27:48.438
Oh, yes.

27:48.698 --> 27:49.459
Describe that.

27:50.401 --> 27:52.784
Describe the activity and how it was done.

27:53.125 --> 27:57.652
We had to be ready in the afternoon to go out to the cut site.

27:58.774 --> 28:06.466
And I think the upperclassmen did all the tree cutting and the freshmen did all the tree hauling, log hauling.

28:07.627 --> 28:11.213
And we loaded them on flatbed trucks and brought them back.

28:12.020 --> 28:19.531
The bonfire at that time was built on the drill field, the Simpson drill field that's in front of the Memorial Student Center.

28:20.512 --> 28:34.171
I remember my freshman year, well, we had some co-eds from the community that would serve hot chocolate to the guard sites around.

28:34.271 --> 28:41.301
We had fire set up guard sites because some of the enemy would try to come in and set the bonfire on fire.

28:42.175 --> 28:52.970
And I remember there was a couple of Aggies in a T-28 trainer that were diving on the bonfire just to give us a buzz.

28:54.132 --> 28:58.318
Couldn't get out and crashed on the other side of the railroad tracks.

28:58.358 --> 29:00.220
I think both of these Aggies were killed.

29:02.263 --> 29:11.997
My freshman year, we also had another Aggie, I believe it was killed by being run into as he was getting some hot chocolate out of the back of a panel truck.

29:12.618 --> 29:14.400
And a car hit them from behind.

29:17.103 --> 29:27.493
But I remember the camaraderie that was built among all of us as we had a part in that bonfire.

29:28.134 --> 29:31.717
About how big was the stack by today's standards?

29:31.737 --> 29:38.424
It was like a teepee that was 30 to 40, maybe 50 feet tall.

29:39.645 --> 29:41.207
And it was just one stack.

29:42.318 --> 29:47.745
And then you would put a pole up on top and try to extend it all you could.

29:47.805 --> 29:54.033
I think I recall that by our senior year, it got pretty tall.

29:54.614 --> 29:57.057
But it was still just one stack.

29:57.077 --> 30:03.265
It was not the cake layered design that you see today.

30:07.931 --> 30:08.832
Yelp practice.

30:12.271 --> 30:20.022
Well, Yale practice was something that it was mandatory your freshman and sophomore years.

30:20.903 --> 30:21.424
Held where?

30:21.804 --> 30:22.906
And it was held in the Grove.

30:24.148 --> 30:30.016
And it was always anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes in length.

30:30.036 --> 30:38.127
And what was interesting was that many times the football players would be there.

30:39.710 --> 30:43.936
And I still think that that was a good thing to have them there.

30:45.257 --> 30:46.499
It wasn't at midnight then?

30:47.180 --> 30:48.302
It was not at midnight.

30:50.464 --> 30:54.390
On Friday night before the game, the players were often there.

30:55.972 --> 30:58.716
And so was it held soon after Chow?

30:59.997 --> 31:02.000
Yes, usually right after Chow we'd go over there.

31:03.442 --> 31:04.283
Silver tabs?

31:06.946 --> 31:08.087
Silver tabs.

31:09.589 --> 31:13.053
What was it like and what impression did it make on it?

31:13.073 --> 31:19.059
Well, silver tabs, at that time, really all the lights were turned off.

31:21.442 --> 31:23.764
And we turned the lights off in our dorms.

31:25.126 --> 31:31.873
And we walked over in the dark, assembled out there in front of the academic building.

31:33.423 --> 31:47.418
And I will never forget when Silver Taps, when they played Silver Taps and the 21-gun salute fired, it just sort of shook you all the way to the core.

31:48.860 --> 32:03.295
And my feeling was Texas A&M or A&M College of Texas, the mechanical and whatever, Agricultural Mechanical College of Texas,

32:04.608 --> 32:06.970
is a different place.

32:08.652 --> 32:17.840
To pay this much attention to some of our fellow students that had died was impressive.

32:17.960 --> 32:27.068
And I just couldn't, I could not believe that the entire campus would reverence that moment.

32:28.890 --> 32:32.353
And it became a focal point

32:33.802 --> 32:42.583
And I remember we had, as freshmen, to go by the flagpole and they would have the names listed of the deceased.

32:43.986 --> 32:45.590
And we needed to know who those were.

32:47.093 --> 32:49.920
But it was another tradition

32:50.558 --> 33:05.682
that maybe you felt at the time was just regimentation, harassment, whatever, but it got you to care and know who people were and give some semblance of concern about their life.

33:06.134 --> 33:12.663
Do you remember anybody ever attempting any hijinks or joke or anything relating to silver taps?

33:12.683 --> 33:14.525
Never, never, never, ever.

33:14.946 --> 33:16.989
It was always a very solemn occasion.

33:17.550 --> 33:22.556
As far as you know, has the ceremony itself changed?

33:23.958 --> 33:26.302
I don't believe that ceremony has changed.

33:28.184 --> 33:28.665
Not at all.

33:29.085 --> 33:32.530
Now, for example, bonfire in your era,

33:33.910 --> 33:37.035
When did you all begin the cutting and so forth?

33:37.095 --> 33:37.576
Do you know?

33:37.596 --> 33:47.793
Oh, it may have happened three or four weeks prior to putting it together.

33:47.833 --> 33:54.644
As I recall, we almost brought the logs in and assembled them as we brought them in.

33:54.925 --> 33:59.833
It wasn't this business of stacking them and sizing them the way they are today.

34:01.130 --> 34:04.015
It was pretty haphazard to some extent.

34:04.836 --> 34:07.741
All right, then final review.

34:10.184 --> 34:18.998
Well, final review was I guess to some extent for a corps member, it was the day.

34:22.143 --> 34:28.133
Most everybody would have their parents here and the mere anticipation

34:29.108 --> 34:32.613
of getting to put on next year's uniform.

34:33.475 --> 34:34.977
I remember my freshman year.

34:36.419 --> 34:43.970
I could not wait to get that sophomore brass, to get the hat worn differently.

34:45.012 --> 34:46.875
It was incredible.

34:46.895 --> 34:50.300
And then, of course, each year there was that anticipation.

34:51.842 --> 34:56.449
And there was a lot more emotion there than you realized was going to

34:57.188 --> 35:16.513
exist because it was closure to the freshman year and it was welcoming in the privilege of being a sophomore or a junior or a senior and that tradition was just

35:17.236 --> 35:18.939
just the highlight of the year.

35:19.259 --> 35:20.301
There was no doubt about it.

35:21.142 --> 35:32.739
And you did not graduate in the spring, but do you remember going through the final review your senior year, your fourth year?

35:33.641 --> 35:37.567
Well, actually, I went through it my end of my junior year.

35:37.847 --> 35:38.268
Okay.

35:38.288 --> 35:44.998
And took, and got to wear my senior boots and my, and all of the brass and everything for the senior.

35:45.839 --> 35:48.282
And then it was at that time I elected not.

35:48.302 --> 35:50.205
I paid $85 for my boots.

35:50.626 --> 35:54.311
Getting married, I needed the money, and I sold them for $85.

35:54.331 --> 35:55.012
They were used.

35:56.213 --> 36:02.362
And I know today there's a lot of people who say, I still have my senior boots, but I couldn't afford to keep my senior boots.

36:02.642 --> 36:03.683
Did they fit very well?

36:04.625 --> 36:06.127
Mine happened to fit pretty good.

36:06.527 --> 36:14.378
I wore about a size 12 shoe, and they were just, I found somebody that had a big foot.

36:15.083 --> 36:17.286
And they worked well.

36:17.306 --> 36:25.495
Of all of the Aggie memorabilia that you may have kept from your undergraduate days, what do you treasure most?

36:28.859 --> 36:44.398
Well, I have an aluminum tray that has a picture of old Sarge with the university seal, or the college seal, as it was known then, and my class year.

36:45.273 --> 36:48.356
And my mother still has that hanging at her house.

36:49.256 --> 36:59.105
And I can't go home without seeing that and remembering when I bought it and gave it to my parents, because I was going to be class of 58.

37:02.528 --> 37:09.574
And your ring, when and how much did it cost, and what are some good Aggie ring stories?

37:11.076 --> 37:14.959
Well, I have a ring story about my ring.

37:15.665 --> 37:16.326
I got it.

37:16.526 --> 37:17.527
It was about $39.

37:17.567 --> 37:29.443
And the old wise tale that still exists probably is the reason they were so cheap was because the former students paid half of the cost.

37:29.463 --> 37:30.464
That wasn't true.

37:31.145 --> 37:36.772
The fact was the volume of rings is what helped so much.

37:36.792 --> 37:41.258
But I got my ring, and we moved to California.

37:41.278 --> 37:44.322
And I wanted a diamond in the worst way in my ring.

37:45.398 --> 37:46.359
But I couldn't afford it.

37:48.040 --> 37:56.508
So after we got out there, I met a jeweler and he showed me a 25-point stone.

37:57.529 --> 38:02.114
And he said, Bob, I'll put that stone in that ring for you for $80.

38:02.314 --> 38:05.777
And I thought, what a deal.

38:06.097 --> 38:09.060
I'll get to put a diamond inside that shield.

38:10.782 --> 38:14.325
This man was suffering from throat cancer.

38:14.913 --> 38:17.696
And he talked with one of those vibrators on his throat.

38:19.718 --> 38:25.503
And his name was Eddie Zion, Jewish fellow, neat man.

38:26.764 --> 38:30.808
And so he put that in there and got it all fixed up for me.

38:32.109 --> 38:34.151
And I described what I wanted done.

38:34.452 --> 38:44.481
But when it came back and he'd finished, he had taken everything inside the circle out and put a platinum

38:45.440 --> 38:49.826
diamond-shaped shield with that stone mounted in it.

38:50.266 --> 38:53.510
The class year, the eagle, the shield, everything was gone.

38:54.452 --> 38:56.434
And the poor old man was about to die.

38:57.235 --> 39:02.282
So I did not have the courage to say, Eddie, you fouled my ring up.

39:02.302 --> 39:06.788
68 then, I came to work for the Association of Former Students.

39:08.089 --> 39:10.232
And Buck Wirus was my boss.

39:10.837 --> 39:17.565
And one day Buck looked down at my ring and he said, what kind of a disastrous ring is that?

39:18.646 --> 39:21.369
He used some other language, much more colorful.

39:22.530 --> 39:24.452
And I said, well, Buck, and I told him the story.

39:25.934 --> 39:26.895
Well, he looked at it.

39:27.115 --> 39:31.280
As I worked on, one day he just grabbed my hand and he said, give me that ring.

39:31.861 --> 39:35.865
He said, we can't have an Aggie working here with a ring that looks like that.

39:36.115 --> 39:48.389
So he called Willard Clark, class of 42, who sold rings for Belfort Company, and Willard put a new top on it for me and put the diamond in, and that's what I'm wearing today.

39:48.970 --> 39:58.140
So this ring actually is 10 years younger than it should be, but it has a lot of good memories because of that.

39:58.340 --> 40:06.730
Have you ever, other ring stories, have you ever been somewhere and somebody spotted it and it turned out to be an important spot?

40:07.350 --> 40:07.651
Yes.

40:08.211 --> 40:20.325
I have been literally around the world at places and someone would recognize my ring and we'd strike up a conversation.

40:20.405 --> 40:22.007
He'd say, I'm class of so-and-so.

40:23.489 --> 40:26.592
The Aggie ring probably is one of the more identifiable

40:27.128 --> 40:29.931
pieces of jewelry that you'll find anywhere in the world.

40:30.892 --> 40:32.694
And so I look for them.

40:32.814 --> 40:37.459
I spot them when I'm on the airplanes in various places.

40:37.479 --> 40:39.621
What creates Aggie spirit?

40:43.486 --> 40:52.275
Well, I think different things create it, but the more I have

40:54.044 --> 40:58.471
been around this place and this is my 32nd year to work for A&M.

41:00.313 --> 41:11.530
I spoke for a muster in 1987 here on campus and of course that was a

41:11.813 --> 41:16.019
very difficult muster to speak for because our son's name was being read.

41:16.079 --> 41:17.721
He had been killed in a car wreck in 86.

41:19.103 --> 41:33.343
But I said to the audience there, and we had that Sol Ross class coming in, and they were sitting out there from the class of 1938, 37, excuse me, because it was their 50th anniversary then.

41:35.365 --> 41:40.993
And I said, you know, the spirit that we feel as Aggies

41:43.454 --> 41:44.715
It's not the buildings.

41:46.157 --> 41:47.238
It's not the campus.

41:48.640 --> 41:54.266
It's not even those of us that are former students precisely.

41:54.286 --> 41:57.690
But I think as much as anything, it's what happens in the classroom.

41:59.492 --> 42:01.395
We had a caring faculty.

42:02.696 --> 42:06.000
We had administrators who wanted us to succeed.

42:08.062 --> 42:10.425
I think that same spirit exists today.

42:11.326 --> 42:13.208
Now, you reinforce that.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.916
with traditions that are unique.

42:18.038 --> 42:24.207
Standing at a football game, I mean, that's the most absurd thing that you can imagine at most schools, any place.

42:25.448 --> 42:36.324
Kissing when a score is made, silver taps, muster, not walking on the grass at the Memorial Student Center.

42:38.908 --> 42:42.553
The ranking system we have within the core

42:43.867 --> 42:46.429
and the privileges that are obtained thereby.

42:46.489 --> 42:54.977
All of these things add to what I call the Aggie spirit, and it is a family spirit as much as anything.

42:55.618 --> 43:01.083
Are you also in this saying, and it's inclusive, not exclusive?

43:01.584 --> 43:04.186
I think it's very inclusive.

43:04.206 --> 43:10.292
And there were many people that said, well, you know, once corps becomes optional, it's going to go to pot.

43:11.833 --> 43:13.755
Once women are admitted, we're in trouble.

43:14.326 --> 43:15.327
And that's not true.

43:15.928 --> 43:24.656
I find that the women have as much commitment to the Aggie family and cause and all of that as anybody around.

43:25.377 --> 43:39.051
And, of course, we have a daughter that's class of 81, and I know from experience, listening to her, that she has the same loyalty and commitment to A&M as anybody.

43:41.427 --> 43:52.557
As you were getting ready to look at the real world at graduation time, how well prepared did you feel A&M had helped you to become?

43:56.560 --> 44:10.692
I didn't realize it maybe as much as I should have at that time, Haskell, but I am convinced that I was more prepared to meet people

44:11.988 --> 44:18.355
to not be afraid of situations because of what I'd been taught at A&M in the core.

44:19.275 --> 44:20.317
You didn't meet a stranger.

44:21.738 --> 44:24.321
You could carry on a conversation with practically anybody.

44:25.602 --> 44:31.688
And when you're in the fundraising business, as I am, you're a salesman.

44:31.708 --> 44:33.890
And we have a great product to sell.

44:34.651 --> 44:41.218
And because of that great product and this ability I had to interact with people and communicate,

44:42.059 --> 44:50.813
that I think the Corps and A&M taught me, I felt well prepared for life and employment opportunities.

44:52.697 --> 45:03.915
In fact, there were people that I worked around that were basically just very shy, and I thought that Corps experience was one of the things that caused me not to be that shy.

45:05.870 --> 45:22.751
And a while ago when I was saying inclusive, to me one of the key things is, okay, so you're from one kind of town and I'm from another, and this person's rich and this one's poor, that all that gets quickly lost in the A&M mix.

45:23.031 --> 45:23.532
Am I correct?

45:23.632 --> 45:26.275
That's exactly right.

45:28.634 --> 45:31.517
Did A&M help you get that first job?

45:34.261 --> 45:45.674
Yes, it did because a fellow Aggie recommended me for the job, and his recommendation is what got me the job.

45:45.694 --> 45:47.857
What are the qualities of being an Aggie?

45:50.760 --> 45:56.447
Well, I have always felt that one of the qualities

45:57.102 --> 46:03.428
that I see in most Aggies is love of country for one thing.

46:05.450 --> 46:26.670
I see a spirit of compassion, a spirit of honesty, a spirit of hard work, and yet I see a spirit of inclusiveness that we're all Aggies.

46:27.697 --> 46:30.782
We're all part of the Aggie family.

46:32.064 --> 46:39.115
And, of course, nothing could be more exemplary of this than this bonfire tragedy of last year.

46:40.818 --> 46:43.522
A&M is a unique place.

46:46.307 --> 46:48.490
Certainly so.

46:50.393 --> 46:55.587
Let's see, I ask already, what did you learn at A&M that proved to be significant?

46:55.627 --> 46:56.790
We've already done that.

46:57.572 --> 47:01.382
The qualities of being an Aggie.

47:04.552 --> 47:22.277
Let's see, if someone were to give you a check for a million dollars, and there's only one condition on that gift that you must pass it on to A&M, but you select what it would be used to do, what would you have that do?

47:25.742 --> 47:32.331
I think I would want it to be in scholarships.

47:34.066 --> 47:35.208
more than any other thing.

47:36.009 --> 47:36.730
Of what sort?

47:36.810 --> 47:37.411
For whom?

47:38.173 --> 47:50.252
And I would want it to be for individuals that have come to A&M and finished their freshman year.
