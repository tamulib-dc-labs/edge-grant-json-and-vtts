WEBVTT

00:02.123 --> 00:19.887
of chatting with Johar Moore and his condominium residence in Austin about his recollections of what it was like to be a student back a few years ago at Texas A&M.

00:19.907 --> 00:20.528
It's 2 p.m.

00:21.530 --> 00:23.532
Yes, 2 p.m.

00:23.552 --> 00:25.956
Why did you attend A&M in the first place?

00:28.059 --> 00:31.303
Oh, my brother had gone there, my older brother.

00:32.228 --> 00:36.513
Warren, and he was a class of 31.

00:37.675 --> 00:44.403
He first went to Lawn Morris College in Jacksonville, transferred to A&M in agriculture.

00:45.244 --> 00:50.270
He had to drop out his senior year because of depression.

00:50.290 --> 00:55.276
But things got a little better by when I graduated in 34.

00:56.998 --> 01:01.223
And so I was pretty well sold on A&M.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.077
You went to high school in?

01:03.497 --> 01:03.798
Alvin.

01:03.858 --> 01:05.099
In Alvin.

01:05.140 --> 01:10.207
Had you visited the campus before you came up?

01:10.227 --> 01:10.507
Yes.

01:10.767 --> 01:19.179
One time, my older brother took me up there, and he and I talked whether I should take engineering or agriculture.

01:20.721 --> 01:25.909
And I remember he said that calculus is real hard or chemistry is hard.

01:25.929 --> 01:27.611
But anyhow, I decided to take engineering.

01:28.192 --> 01:28.392
All right.

01:28.810 --> 01:31.453
Do you have any recollections of that first trip?

01:31.493 --> 01:33.976
How long were you there, and what did it seem like to you?

01:39.041 --> 01:42.805
Well, I'd say that we weren't there very long, maybe several hours.

01:44.067 --> 01:48.612
And it could be that we were going from one place to another and just stopped by there.

01:49.052 --> 01:51.895
We didn't visit anyone or talk to anyone.

01:51.915 --> 01:52.216
Okay.

01:52.236 --> 01:56.020
So we just drove around the campus, and that's it.

01:56.040 --> 01:56.240
All right.

01:56.260 --> 01:58.783
When you came up then to enroll,

01:59.506 --> 02:00.647
How did you get there?

02:02.169 --> 02:08.838
My dad and mother drove me and a friend up in a Model T Ford.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.644
And a long trip from Alvin?

02:14.005 --> 02:15.006
Well, it wasn't too long.

02:15.867 --> 02:18.851
Actually, it was around 130 or 140.

02:19.412 --> 02:22.115
But the roads weren't as good from Alvin to Houston then.

02:22.696 --> 02:25.800
But they weren't too bad from Houston to Hempstead.

02:26.438 --> 02:29.362
And then the old Welburn Road is one that came over.

02:29.382 --> 02:30.383
I think it was paved then.

02:31.104 --> 02:37.192
What did you bring in the way of clothing and gear and anything?

02:40.216 --> 02:40.416
Let's see.

02:40.436 --> 02:43.681
We had a catalog, and it advised to bring a footlocker.

02:44.762 --> 02:51.090
So we bought a footlocker and marked the clothes.

02:51.110 --> 02:56.277
They had almost everything that they had.

02:57.337 --> 03:06.427
I didn't take very many clothes because I knew I was going to get uniforms.

03:06.447 --> 03:09.089
So I had very little clothes, just underwear.

03:10.511 --> 03:11.071
No shirts.

03:13.234 --> 03:20.501
Was there anything for you freshman special before the academic year began in the fall?

03:20.742 --> 03:21.262
No.

03:21.282 --> 03:23.224
Y'all didn't come early or anything like that?

03:23.344 --> 03:23.605
No.

03:24.445 --> 03:26.888
I think we came on a Sunday.

03:27.458 --> 03:35.725
If I'm not mistaken, we started making our selections and enrolling on Monday.

03:37.267 --> 03:40.710
Describe the campus as it was when you were a fish.

03:42.091 --> 03:42.692
What was there?

03:42.852 --> 03:43.773
What were the buildings?

03:44.834 --> 03:51.940
Well, of course, I guess it would be the West Gate was the main part from the depot.

03:52.941 --> 03:56.284
Most everything centered from the depot back to the main building.

04:00.145 --> 04:07.954
At that time, they had a couple fairly good dormitories, fairly new.

04:08.034 --> 04:10.157
Where were those new dormitories?

04:10.197 --> 04:13.981
Well, I selected Walton Hall.

04:14.322 --> 04:15.623
We had a little bit of a chance.

04:16.484 --> 04:18.547
The engineers were over there in Walton Hall.

04:20.028 --> 04:27.537
And on Monday, after we looked around, I actually...

04:27.888 --> 04:29.470
asked if we could get in.

04:29.490 --> 04:32.575
They said if you're taking engineering, you can as a Corps of Engineers.

04:33.777 --> 04:40.206
So my friend and I both started out in engineering.

04:42.269 --> 04:46.936
And your outfit, what outfit were you assigned?

04:47.076 --> 04:48.579
B Company Engineers.

04:48.819 --> 04:49.840
Did it have a nickname?

04:50.381 --> 04:51.823
No.

04:52.244 --> 04:55.929
Did that end up being a special group of people for you?

04:56.630 --> 04:57.051
Oh yes.

04:57.453 --> 05:00.796
Please, at length, tell about that.

05:02.859 --> 05:11.388
Well, I'd say that we were all on one stoop, and there weren't too many.

05:13.750 --> 05:21.138
And CB Company was in A rampantly.

05:21.158 --> 05:26.143
Anyhow, the fellows that stayed

05:28.132 --> 05:45.987
and survived, got to know each other pretty well and I'd say probably my friend, he decided that he was going to take a different course and he dropped out and later he dropped out and went to the University of Houston.

05:46.008 --> 05:56.957
There was four fellows that graduated at the same time I did at Alvin and I was the only one that stayed after about a year and a half.

05:57.224 --> 06:00.429
Did you know pretty well what your major was going to be when you got there?

06:00.449 --> 06:00.569
Yes.

06:01.070 --> 06:01.451
Why?

06:03.053 --> 06:05.337
There was oil drilling in the area.

06:06.318 --> 06:12.248
When I was about a sophomore or junior in high school, Texaco found the Manville Field.

06:13.329 --> 06:15.533
My dad had quite a lot of land.

06:15.994 --> 06:23.265
He had three dairies, and there was no activity near us.

06:23.365 --> 06:25.088
It was about 20 miles away.

06:25.675 --> 06:28.458
But they were doing seismograph work in our area.

06:29.499 --> 06:32.742
And that's the first experience that I had.

06:33.723 --> 06:43.393
I actually opened some gates to our farm so that the shell, they were running Tarzan balance crew at that time.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.236
They paid me five cents a gate.

06:47.137 --> 06:52.763
That's the first money I made in the oil business.

06:53.080 --> 07:02.392
My dad was very much interested, and he encouraged me to go in the oil business, even though I had a pretty good choice of going into agriculture.

07:02.932 --> 07:08.940
Describe as well as you can, as thoroughly as you can, what it was like to be a fish.

07:10.442 --> 07:12.024
And what year is this, 1930?

07:12.044 --> 07:12.384
Yes, 34.

07:12.404 --> 07:12.625
1934.

07:14.547 --> 07:16.630
What was it like to be a fish?

07:16.670 --> 07:17.691
It was the fall of 34.

07:19.533 --> 07:20.775
Well, I was scared to death.

07:21.532 --> 07:22.413
Most of the time.

07:22.634 --> 07:25.297
It really wasn't that.

07:25.537 --> 07:29.122
I was probably, I never was homesick.

07:30.564 --> 07:50.712
And I suppose because, maybe because I'd worked so much and I wasn't a very good student the first year because the background that I had wasn't too good.

07:52.210 --> 07:55.935
I actually failed the course first year.

07:58.078 --> 08:01.122
After that, I made pretty good grades.

08:01.162 --> 08:03.585
Tell me about haircuts and uniforms.

08:04.566 --> 08:09.292
They didn't have the shortcuts then.

08:10.774 --> 08:13.978
They really didn't.

08:14.018 --> 08:19.185
They issued us a jacket and trousers.

08:19.205 --> 08:20.867
We had to buy our shirts.

08:21.607 --> 08:28.194
That's for freshmen and sophomores.

08:28.214 --> 08:38.003
When you got to be a junior, I believe you could buy your own clothes with better quality and so forth.

08:38.023 --> 08:44.490
And of what kind of material and color were these core uniforms then?

08:45.010 --> 08:46.712
Khaki.

08:46.732 --> 08:49.875
I'll show you a picture if that describes it.

08:50.159 --> 08:53.202
Did you have the campaign hat?

08:53.222 --> 08:56.204
A campaign hat, and did seniors have the same?

08:57.145 --> 08:57.806
They wore boots.

08:58.206 --> 08:59.588
Same as today?

08:59.828 --> 09:03.371
They wore boots, yeah.

09:03.952 --> 09:09.797
Describe for me a typical weekday of activity for a freshman then.

09:10.297 --> 09:14.381
What time did it begin, and what all happened during a typical day?

09:14.781 --> 09:18.765
Well, you were assigned the upper classmen's

09:19.268 --> 09:23.133
room to clean and make up the beds.

09:24.395 --> 09:26.137
So you started fairly early.

09:27.879 --> 09:37.592
Let's see, I think we would, I don't remember whether we cleaned before we went to breakfast or afterwards, but we made the beds.

09:39.555 --> 09:48.246
And that's about all the, during the day, sometimes some of the sophomores would send you on an errand or something,

09:48.732 --> 10:00.928
The engineers were a little different than some of the other companies or outfits like, say, the infantry or so forth.

10:00.948 --> 10:14.445
They didn't have the studious people, and actually our commander enforced the study real good at night.

10:14.465 --> 10:17.028
What time was Reveille day?

10:17.048 --> 10:18.250
God, I don't know.

10:18.787 --> 10:20.028
when the bugle blew.

10:20.909 --> 10:23.092
And did you all fall out for?

10:23.112 --> 10:25.455
Oh yeah, we marched every meal.

10:25.515 --> 10:26.216
Every meal.

10:26.316 --> 10:27.357
Yes.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.600
And in those days you ate at?

10:30.461 --> 10:31.302
Sebesa Hall.

10:31.322 --> 10:31.982
At Sebesa.

10:32.383 --> 10:36.508
Describe for me the routine at meals for freshmen.

10:37.088 --> 10:39.211
Who sat at what table and how?

10:39.231 --> 10:46.279
Well, we sat like companies and they alternate the freshmen with sophomores and they would

10:47.542 --> 10:57.437
You had to do a few things to correct your manners and so forth, and they had certain things that you had to do.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.458
Describe those, please.

10:58.498 --> 11:11.758
Well, you had to learn the terminology, like shoot, let's see, to order something, instead of passing it, you say shoot the bull, and that was beef.

11:11.798 --> 11:12.118
Okay.

11:12.218 --> 11:15.523
What were some of the other slang terms for the food?

11:19.013 --> 11:20.675
I've forgotten.

11:21.756 --> 11:25.400
Tea, butter, milk, dessert.

11:26.661 --> 11:29.544
That's kush.

11:29.564 --> 11:32.467
Kush and dessert.

11:32.487 --> 11:33.768
I forget what they call a bread.

11:34.529 --> 11:36.090
Anyhow.

11:36.931 --> 11:40.515
And could freshmen eat whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted?

11:45.480 --> 11:48.463
Well, in our particular company, they weren't too...

11:48.730 --> 11:49.411
restricted.

11:50.552 --> 11:51.653
We got enough to eat.

11:51.674 --> 11:55.979
Alright, and classes were normally what time of day?

11:57.841 --> 11:58.021
Eight.

11:58.842 --> 12:00.144
You had classes all morning.

12:00.885 --> 12:02.326
Did you march to class?

12:02.707 --> 12:04.769
No.

12:04.789 --> 12:09.435
That was one thing we used to do for breakfast especially.

12:09.475 --> 12:16.543
The sophomores would tell us to bring out some milk or sweet rolls for them.

12:16.563 --> 12:18.045
So we would hide that in our

12:18.245 --> 12:20.207
under our shirts to try to get by.

12:20.247 --> 12:29.718
They always had a sergeant at the door going out of Sabisa Hall to try to catch us, but I never did get caught.

12:29.738 --> 12:31.921
And they just had poor eyesight.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.704
They just didn't notice that y'all had... I don't think they cared.

12:35.044 --> 12:37.887
They were regular army sergeants.

12:38.528 --> 12:47.138
And then was there any difference in the routine, breakfast, lunch, dinner?

12:48.434 --> 12:54.884
Well, I'd say there was more organized activity at the dinner.

12:56.247 --> 13:02.417
A lot of times they would make announcements and do certain things.

13:04.300 --> 13:08.106
Do you remember any favorite foods at the dining halls?

13:08.346 --> 13:10.409
Some that were particularly good?

13:13.134 --> 13:15.758
Really, the food was all good.

13:16.987 --> 13:18.188
I had no complaints.

13:18.509 --> 13:20.931
And was it adequate in quantity?

13:20.951 --> 13:22.873
Oh, yes.

13:23.614 --> 13:24.095
Let's see.

13:24.795 --> 13:26.698
You ate with your outfit.

13:30.201 --> 13:38.230
As you look back now, did that outfit have any effect on you as you were maturing?

13:38.250 --> 13:39.291
Any of those friends?

13:39.552 --> 13:40.372
No.

13:41.994 --> 13:44.597
I'd say about the only thing

13:46.872 --> 13:55.188
that I didn't really, I wasn't too much into the hazing of underclassmen.

13:55.208 --> 14:00.798
And at some point I made up my mind that I would never haze an underclassman.

14:00.818 --> 14:02.441
Were you hazed as a freshman?

14:02.481 --> 14:03.123
Not too much.

14:03.824 --> 14:05.447
Describe what it was.

14:06.709 --> 14:09.775
Well, if you did something,

14:10.936 --> 14:13.460
particular sophomores.

14:14.141 --> 14:25.657
Usually the sophomores were kind of in charge of the freshmen and the juniors in charge of the softs and seniors were over everybody.

14:26.959 --> 14:36.353
Actually they had boards and I'd say that they had a, I guess you'd call it a

14:40.349 --> 14:43.974
what would you call a, they had what they call Christmas licks.

14:46.098 --> 14:50.144
And they'd give you some licks before you went home.

14:51.926 --> 14:54.230
And where did that happen?

14:54.290 --> 14:54.711
In the hallway?

14:54.731 --> 14:55.372
In your room.

14:55.392 --> 14:58.056
They'd come in your room.

14:58.096 --> 15:06.188
No, that's correct, because when I was a sophomore, I would go in and beat on the bed instead of the kids.

15:07.045 --> 15:11.191
Did you do push-ups and any other routines?

15:11.211 --> 15:12.072
No, duck bonk.

15:12.373 --> 15:13.895
They make you do that sometimes.

15:13.935 --> 15:17.180
That was when you fouled up in drilling.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.183
And we really fouled up a lot of time.

15:19.583 --> 15:23.169
Where did drills, where were they held?

15:23.769 --> 15:33.103
Actually, the companies drilled out in the street or in the area nearby.

15:33.556 --> 15:54.759
When all of them got together, we very seldom, let's see, I'd say maybe every month or so they'd have a large drill and all go to the drill field, which is across from the MSC right now.

15:54.779 --> 15:57.722
In the afternoons, if nothing was scheduled, what did you all do?

15:58.763 --> 16:00.745
Well, there was something scheduled all the time.

16:01.484 --> 16:07.110
I'd say the Saturdays and Sundays were about the only time we had very much time off.

16:07.130 --> 16:12.056
See, we either had class or P.E.

16:12.777 --> 16:13.798
or intermural games.

16:14.158 --> 16:16.461
We had pretty well organized intermural.

16:17.562 --> 16:19.124
So he was doing something of that.

16:19.705 --> 16:20.786
I worked the first year.

16:21.447 --> 16:25.511
Oh, describe your job and pay and so forth.

16:26.913 --> 16:30.597
There was a fellow that ran a nursery.

16:31.505 --> 16:40.257
at Alvin and he graduated from A&M and he knew the fellow Hensel, his head was an agriculture department, did you ever hear of him?

16:40.278 --> 16:45.305
And he spoke a word to him and I got a job.

16:46.246 --> 16:51.754
And I worked, now that's why I was wondering what I was doing in the extra time.

16:52.114 --> 17:00.246
I worked about, I'd say, three or four days a week for say an hour or two.

17:00.614 --> 17:07.825
pulling or doing work around, and we paid 25 cents an hour.

17:07.865 --> 17:09.608
That was in the first year.

17:10.409 --> 17:12.593
Was this on the campus, flower beds and so forth?

17:12.613 --> 17:13.294
It was right there.

17:14.556 --> 17:22.368
It's where they, just across from the polo field.

17:22.408 --> 17:24.892
That's where they had all their stuff at that time.

17:25.012 --> 17:28.798
Oh, so you're saying this was part of the ag experiment area?

17:29.403 --> 17:30.304
or ag research.

17:30.404 --> 17:31.545
This was not landscaping.

17:32.106 --> 17:32.446
Oh, no.

17:32.846 --> 17:35.850
No, we didn't work on the campus of landscaping.

17:35.870 --> 17:39.173
We worked for Mr. Henssel.

17:39.313 --> 17:40.855
He was head, Dr. Henssel.

17:40.875 --> 17:44.478
He was head of biology or botany or whatever.

17:44.558 --> 17:44.679
Right.

17:44.939 --> 17:48.903
This was in a, these would have been ag research fields.

17:48.923 --> 17:49.143
Yes.

17:49.523 --> 17:49.664
Ah.

17:49.684 --> 17:50.104
Yeah.

17:50.785 --> 17:57.992
And all we did, we were assigned to a fellow, an older gentleman named Zittipel.

17:58.124 --> 18:03.771
He was a real old gentleman and he would tell us what to do and keep us working.

18:04.392 --> 18:06.254
Did many students have jobs then?

18:06.715 --> 18:07.776
Yeah.

18:08.317 --> 18:15.206
Most of the good jobs that paid the most were at the mess hall, but I didn't apply for those.

18:15.226 --> 18:18.770
I got this one and I was satisfied with working outside.

18:19.371 --> 18:21.614
Do you have any idea of what those mess hall jobs paid?

18:21.674 --> 18:23.997
No, I don't have any idea.

18:24.618 --> 18:29.803
And do you have a guess as to what percentage of the students then had some sort of job?

18:30.184 --> 18:38.753
I never had thought of it, but I'd say maybe 30 or 40 percent.

18:40.054 --> 18:44.499
Do you remember what a year cost for a student then?

18:47.562 --> 18:49.184
I'd say under $1,500.

18:51.686 --> 18:54.169
But you don't remember a specific.

18:54.402 --> 18:54.943
$1,500.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.625
It went up a little bit each year.

18:57.666 --> 19:05.534
All right, this money that you earned, for you, was that spending money or did that go to pay A&M bills?

19:05.554 --> 19:07.676
Well, it was spending money, absolutely.

19:07.696 --> 19:10.119
And what did a student spend money on in those days?

19:11.521 --> 19:14.083
Hamburgers, sometimes, or ice cream.

19:14.103 --> 19:14.444
Where?

19:15.625 --> 19:17.487
We went into Bryan on the weekends.

19:18.348 --> 19:22.552
How did you get there?

19:22.572 --> 19:23.093
Hitchhike.

19:24.355 --> 19:31.301
It's, they used to have a trolley, but it wasn't in, I'd say that we hitchhiked, caught a ride or something like that.

19:31.321 --> 19:32.862
Had the trolley ceased by the time?

19:32.962 --> 19:33.563
Yeah.

19:34.103 --> 19:36.165
And there was no buses.

19:36.185 --> 19:39.067
And do you remember down, where you ate those hamburgers?

19:39.107 --> 19:41.489
Were there any famous place downtown Bryan?

19:41.890 --> 19:43.491
Well, there was one cafe.

19:44.192 --> 19:48.996
Actually, there was a hamburger place on campus.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.198
It was called Joe's Place.

19:51.218 --> 19:52.018
It was a little house.

19:52.659 --> 19:53.940
Some good old fella.

19:54.815 --> 19:55.896
He'd make hamburgers.

19:55.916 --> 19:59.099
So between meals, if you'd get something to eat, you'd go there.

19:59.680 --> 20:06.107
But in town, they had a, it was a Lebanese restaurant.

20:06.127 --> 20:12.854
In fact, Halibuti had, you know, he's left.

20:13.174 --> 20:14.736
This is Mike Halibuti from Beaumont.

20:14.956 --> 20:16.137
Yeah.

20:16.157 --> 20:19.381
But he was there just before I was.

20:19.421 --> 20:20.462
He was in graduate school.

20:20.482 --> 20:22.985
But he was dating one of these beautiful gals.

20:23.485 --> 20:24.366
Maybe that's why this,

20:24.768 --> 20:28.934
restaurant was so good, I don't remember the name of the restaurant.

20:28.954 --> 20:31.557
It was owned by a Lebanese family.

20:31.617 --> 20:32.879
They had two or three daughters.

20:32.979 --> 20:33.961
It was pretty good looking.

20:33.981 --> 20:35.062
And this was in Bryan?

20:35.082 --> 20:35.463
In Bryan.

20:35.563 --> 20:36.905
In Bryan, yeah.

20:37.485 --> 20:39.588
Street off of Texas.

20:39.608 --> 20:42.472
When y'all went to the movie, where'd you go to the movie?

20:42.492 --> 20:47.759
Well, you could go in Bryan, or most of the time you went at A&M.

20:47.779 --> 20:48.921
Where?

20:48.941 --> 20:53.307
Well, they had a building there, and it's torn down now.

20:54.518 --> 20:55.579
Named Guyon Hall?

20:56.120 --> 20:57.001
No, no.

20:57.041 --> 20:59.685
They had a regular movie place.

20:59.705 --> 21:00.927
They had a balcony.

21:00.947 --> 21:01.507
On the campus?

21:01.688 --> 21:01.928
Yes.

21:02.068 --> 21:03.690
But not Guyon?

21:03.750 --> 21:04.411
No, no.

21:04.431 --> 21:09.077
That was a big assembly place.

21:09.258 --> 21:10.860
They actually had a wooden building.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.262
Over near Northgate, wasn't it?

21:12.402 --> 21:13.203
Over near Cebiza?

21:14.445 --> 21:16.888
Yeah, it wasn't too far from Cebiza.

21:16.908 --> 21:19.171
It's where the church is now.

21:19.191 --> 21:21.834
The student chapel.

21:22.055 --> 21:22.315
Yeah.

21:22.700 --> 21:31.069
When you went to the movie, was there a certain, were you more likely to go on the weekends?

21:31.829 --> 21:34.913
It's possible that they didn't have them except on weekends.

21:34.933 --> 21:37.535
But they had a balcony downstairs.

21:38.576 --> 21:44.883
They sold peanuts, and the guys upstairs would throw down peanuts to hit somebody down below.

21:44.943 --> 21:48.927
The thing was trying to hit them hard enough to break the shell on the peanuts.

21:49.953 --> 21:54.078
Where did a student go in those days to buy alcoholic beverage?

21:58.784 --> 22:05.712
I believe that, I'm not sure, what year did beer come in?

22:05.732 --> 22:07.074
36, wasn't it?

22:07.094 --> 22:12.120
So it was dry when I was there, and there were bootleggers in the area, I guess.

22:12.881 --> 22:14.763
Do you remember where any of them operated?

22:15.524 --> 22:15.725
No.

22:16.926 --> 22:18.508
And Hard Liquors wasn't open yet?

22:19.096 --> 22:21.299
Well, I never did go to Hard Lakers.

22:21.319 --> 22:24.662
I don't know why, and there wasn't a reason.

22:24.682 --> 22:33.312
But there wasn't too much drinking in those days.

22:33.573 --> 22:43.764
Please describe for me some pranks, some jokes, some good bull things that you were aware that somebody did while you were there.

22:43.844 --> 22:48.349
Students playing a prank on another student.

22:48.369 --> 22:48.850
Oh, gosh.

22:49.403 --> 22:50.965
Tell me about as many as you can.

22:52.627 --> 22:56.552
Well, I really don't know a whole lot.

22:56.572 --> 22:59.115
But there was something going on all the time.

23:00.838 --> 23:04.462
And I'd say what they call skying out.

23:05.303 --> 23:06.104
What is that?

23:06.545 --> 23:17.419
Well, that's putting a bucket of water on the door, open just a little bit, and then when someone goes in, the water comes down on them.

23:18.952 --> 23:24.119
Throw it out the window if somebody passed it below.

23:25.180 --> 23:26.421
Did you all stack their room?

23:26.742 --> 23:28.584
Did anybody ever get his room stacked?

23:29.325 --> 23:30.727
Oh, they do that all the time.

23:31.388 --> 23:32.870
And what would be put in the room?

23:33.871 --> 23:43.323
No, actually, what they did is just go in and take everything out of the drawers and throw it on the floor.

23:44.444 --> 23:47.288
They didn't, let's see, what did they call that?

23:49.310 --> 23:51.112
And they had all kinds of things.

23:52.373 --> 23:57.198
And one of the funny things, it was another group.

23:57.218 --> 24:03.665
The engineers, ordinarily, were kind of the ones that had to study more or a little more serious.

24:04.946 --> 24:06.188
But there was another outfit.

24:06.768 --> 24:07.970
I forget what they would be.

24:07.990 --> 24:10.933
It could have been the band.

24:10.953 --> 24:15.958
And they had a way that

24:17.305 --> 24:28.460
They would dress up two guys as girls and tell some suspected person that there was a couple of girls out there.

24:28.480 --> 24:39.835
And he would go out and he'd lay down between these two girls and then they would hold him down and embarrass him.

24:41.597 --> 24:43.059
This would be out on the ground, outside?

24:43.079 --> 24:45.422
Yeah, that'd be at night, of course, or late at night.

24:46.229 --> 24:49.553
Did this kind of stunt have a name, or do you remember?

24:50.875 --> 24:52.577
Well, I'm sure they had a name for it.

24:52.597 --> 24:53.818
I don't know what it was.

24:53.838 --> 25:01.248
Now, I've heard some stories about somebody coming back to his room and an animal being tied in his room.

25:01.348 --> 25:02.729
Did that ever happen?

25:04.612 --> 25:07.335
Not in what I was.

25:08.136 --> 25:08.737
Let's see.

25:10.699 --> 25:13.823
How was life different for a sophomore

25:15.558 --> 25:18.162
than it had been for you as a freshman?

25:18.182 --> 25:19.263
Well, it was a lot easier.

25:20.244 --> 25:20.585
Why?

25:20.925 --> 25:24.971
Well, you'd been there and were a little bit used to everything.

25:25.011 --> 25:29.197
You learned how to study, so it was much more pleasant.

25:29.217 --> 25:32.902
All right, you said that you made a kind of a mental decision.

25:32.942 --> 25:37.428
You were never going to use a board on a... That is correct.

25:37.508 --> 25:37.848
Why?

25:39.831 --> 25:45.058
I didn't think it was... I didn't have a... I didn't resent it so much, but I just didn't think...

25:46.523 --> 25:49.346
did any good and I felt sorry for the guys.

25:49.506 --> 25:50.427
I liked them.

25:50.447 --> 25:52.589
What did your fellow students think about your policy?

25:54.591 --> 26:05.022
I'd say that our whole outfit over the four years that I was there pretty well had the same attitude.

26:05.683 --> 26:15.653
You know that in hazing you get one radical guy that can hurt the whole thing and that was

26:16.561 --> 26:21.908
In my freshman year, we only had two guys that were real bad.

26:22.769 --> 26:24.811
I determined I wasn't going to be like that.

26:24.831 --> 26:29.557
Did you all ever do anything back to pay off those two bad guys?

26:31.139 --> 26:31.760
Not too much.

26:34.423 --> 26:36.566
They both quit in time.

26:37.667 --> 26:40.471
They've got a name for them.

26:41.051 --> 26:42.433
Tell me in general,

26:42.852 --> 26:44.394
about the student body?

26:44.474 --> 26:47.218
Was it rural or urban, rich or poor?

26:47.278 --> 26:58.513
I'd say it was mostly, if you give a percentage it would be maybe 75 percent.

27:01.077 --> 27:04.441
Were they well to do or working?

27:04.461 --> 27:07.746
There were very few well to do.

27:07.766 --> 27:09.568
Just take my company.

27:11.675 --> 27:13.457
I don't think that any of them were.

27:15.619 --> 27:25.029
See, my closest friends, one of them was from San Antonio, and his dad had a tire company or worked for a tire company.

27:25.049 --> 27:33.118
And some of the others, the captain of our company, his dad was a farmer.

27:33.138 --> 27:41.547
And I'd say out of our small group, it was about half an agent actually.

27:41.797 --> 27:44.240
But the whole school, mostly the agriculture school.

27:44.540 --> 27:47.063
From what part of the state geographically?

27:47.784 --> 27:49.927
Pretty much everywhere.

27:49.947 --> 27:55.534
I knew boys from every part of the state.

27:55.554 --> 27:57.396
And liberal, conservative?

27:58.237 --> 28:00.540
Conservative.

28:01.981 --> 28:10.892
Were there some memorable teachers, advisors, counselors that you could describe from your student days?

28:12.323 --> 28:17.228
Well, one fellow that got to know names is Penberthy.

28:18.049 --> 28:18.730
You ever hear of him?

28:18.870 --> 28:19.811
Penny?

28:20.132 --> 28:24.536
He was a friendly type of fellow, and I think he especially helped the freshmen.

28:24.556 --> 28:25.838
What did he teach?

28:25.858 --> 28:30.783
He taught PE, physical education.

28:30.803 --> 28:39.613
And I'd say I didn't have as much contact with him after the freshman year.

28:40.589 --> 28:50.220
But he had a lot of influence on making him more comfortable and getting adjusted to the university.

28:50.260 --> 28:53.724
What about in other areas, like in engineering?

28:53.744 --> 28:58.009
Some other teachers that you remember positively?

28:59.812 --> 29:08.041
I'd say that one of the early teachers that impressed me was a fellow that lectured in chemistry.

29:08.522 --> 29:10.444
His name was Brayden, Dr. Brayden.

29:10.795 --> 29:12.137
Did he have a nickname?

29:12.157 --> 29:15.881
No.

29:15.901 --> 29:17.623
There were some that had a nickname.

29:17.863 --> 29:19.925
Please share as many of those as you can recall.

29:20.446 --> 29:27.394
Well, there was one that taught civil engineering.

29:27.414 --> 29:29.036
It was Cuball.

29:29.056 --> 29:30.958
What was his last name?

29:30.978 --> 29:31.438
Do you remember?

29:32.299 --> 29:33.440
All I remember is Cuball.

29:33.761 --> 29:35.303
Cuball?

29:36.284 --> 29:36.944
I'm not sure.

29:36.964 --> 29:39.267
It could have been they had more than one Cuball.

29:41.153 --> 29:50.524
And actually, for some reason, most of the... See, I was in geology.

29:51.925 --> 30:00.595
We did have one fellow, this older fellow, who taught paleontology, I believe.

30:01.637 --> 30:03.439
And they called him Fossili.

30:04.680 --> 30:07.203
Remember his last name?

30:07.223 --> 30:08.344
Bert, I think.

30:08.364 --> 30:08.525
Fossili.

30:08.545 --> 30:09.025
I'm not sure.

30:09.386 --> 30:10.026
Fossili.

30:10.187 --> 30:10.587
Okay.

30:10.786 --> 30:16.835
And the head of the department, his name was Baker of Geology.

30:16.855 --> 30:23.826
You see, I'm sure they had a nickname for him.

30:24.087 --> 30:30.176
I started out in geological engineering.

30:30.196 --> 30:38.970
And about my, after my sophomore year, I was advised that petroleum engineers

30:39.271 --> 30:43.156
were more apt to get hired than geologists.

30:43.176 --> 30:45.599
That's because of the condition of the oil business at that time.

30:46.240 --> 30:49.143
So I changed two patrolling instruments.

30:49.163 --> 30:50.545
And I liked Harold Vance.

30:50.565 --> 30:52.147
He was head of the department.

30:52.167 --> 30:55.190
Well, Stevens was his under him.

30:56.993 --> 30:58.114
Burke Stevens.

30:58.134 --> 31:07.105
And I'm not sure that either one of them had an enigma.

31:07.125 --> 31:07.325
Let's see.

31:07.345 --> 31:08.687
Math, English.

31:09.595 --> 31:36.818
uh chemistry chemistry remember any nicknames for any of those areas physics mechanical drawing yes i wasn't too much into this all right let me let's think about these faculty members in a different way if if we all if you could go back and think

31:37.338 --> 31:38.761
Some special individuals.

31:38.822 --> 31:46.019
Can you think of some people that you'd like to wish you could tell them how much you appreciate what they meant to you?

31:46.540 --> 31:47.503
Can you think of some?

31:47.603 --> 31:50.029
Well, sure.

31:50.049 --> 31:53.036
I'd say Penberthy.

31:53.217 --> 31:55.482
Penberthy.
