WEBVTT

00:02.731 --> 00:05.094
in the department that might have been known at that time?

00:06.696 --> 00:08.598
Well, Koenig came then.

00:09.078 --> 00:09.759
Carl Koenig?

00:09.959 --> 00:12.342
K-O-E-N-I-G.

00:12.622 --> 00:12.983
Yeah, right.

00:13.003 --> 00:14.825
He just retired here lately.

00:20.351 --> 00:22.654
Were there any kind of legendary teachers?

00:23.555 --> 00:23.976
Yes.

00:26.639 --> 00:27.420
Paul Weaver.

00:27.880 --> 00:28.441
Paul Weaver.

00:29.202 --> 00:30.443
What was his specialty?

00:30.997 --> 00:49.185
Paul Weaver had a bachelor's degree in geology and worked for Shell Oil and had been president of AAPG, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.

00:49.205 --> 00:59.721
And during World War I, he had

01:01.709 --> 01:14.062
learned Russian on board the ship from Vancouver, Washington, to the east in that period of time.

01:15.323 --> 01:16.945
He had a photographic memory.

01:18.526 --> 01:22.510
But unlike a lot of people with photographic memories, he could use the data.

01:25.153 --> 01:27.936
And so he was a pretty sharp fellow.

01:30.143 --> 01:36.863
Were there some nicknames the students gave to the faculty for their teaching and so forth?

01:37.325 --> 01:39.090
Well, I wasn't familiar with them.

01:39.948 --> 01:45.679
Well, you know, like over in sociology, Dr. Dan, Dan Russell was Dr. Dan, the grade point man.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.082
Oh.

01:47.202 --> 01:51.350
In history, we had Screamin' Al Nelson and Notes Nance.

01:52.191 --> 01:52.913
Okay.

01:54.496 --> 01:58.123
Now, where was the department located physically and what building are buildings?

01:58.143 --> 02:00.808
Still the same building that we're in right now.

02:00.923 --> 02:05.630
And what kind of facilities did it have then in terms of labs?

02:06.571 --> 02:09.174
Well, it's been remodeled since then.

02:09.194 --> 02:10.817
They were pretty primitive.

02:12.058 --> 02:18.447
And we didn't have air conditioning either.

02:18.467 --> 02:25.497
And we were required to wear a shirt with a tie on it.

02:27.198 --> 02:32.906
And nowadays, well, this is the way I teach nowadays.

02:33.708 --> 02:37.032
Who was it that conveyed those rules to you?

02:37.533 --> 02:38.515
How did they tell you?

02:38.535 --> 02:40.938
The department had conveyed them.

02:41.719 --> 02:45.565
And I don't know where they came from, but I think they came from the dean.

02:47.327 --> 02:49.130
And this was in engineering.

02:49.210 --> 02:52.134
So the dean, when you arrived, was Calhoun?

02:52.795 --> 02:53.256
No.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.823
We had an interim dean.

02:56.843 --> 02:57.244
Oh, okay.

02:59.306 --> 03:02.290
And then who became the first permanent dean?

03:03.932 --> 03:06.015
Well, Calhoun was in place.

03:06.956 --> 03:07.157
Okay.

03:07.177 --> 03:11.482
Describe the reaction when Calhoun came.

03:11.563 --> 03:13.145
What did people think of him as dean?

03:14.506 --> 03:16.108
Well, he was innovative.

03:16.169 --> 03:17.190
He wanted changes.

03:18.772 --> 03:21.876
Did he want any changes relating to geology?

03:22.750 --> 03:23.813
Not that I know of.

03:24.936 --> 03:37.349
The main thing in geology then was ECPD, the engineering board that approves curriculum and approves your program.

03:37.750 --> 03:38.953
And of course,

03:38.933 --> 03:45.983
I think that probably they still go through that accreditation over in engineering.

03:46.044 --> 03:49.789
But I remember we didn't like that when it came around.

03:49.809 --> 03:54.156
You had a lot of paperwork to fill out and stuff.

03:54.176 --> 04:02.528
And at that time, I think we only had three engineers in the department.

04:02.508 --> 04:10.444
One was Parker, and Clay Seward was there.

04:10.524 --> 04:12.208
He was in.

04:13.030 --> 04:20.044
And incidentally, when I was first here, I found out that one at the bases

04:21.492 --> 04:41.534
Over in France, when I was coming back home, Seward happened to be at the same base, except Seward was attached to the Air Corps as an artillery person, anti-aircraft, yes.

04:42.695 --> 04:46.960
And of course, I asked Seward once,

04:47.277 --> 04:50.242
Have you ever shot down a German plane and said no?

04:50.282 --> 04:59.518
I had my crew aim at one, but we shot down our American plane that was following it.

04:59.779 --> 05:04.908
This is why friendly fire that I don't get too concerned about.

05:05.208 --> 05:07.793
How were you received into the department?

05:07.833 --> 05:09.015
Was there any kind of

05:09.552 --> 05:11.494
orientation to the department?

05:11.995 --> 05:12.335
Nothing.

05:12.355 --> 05:12.916
Or A&M?

05:12.936 --> 05:13.276
Nothing.

05:13.436 --> 05:18.282
How did you find out what your course is, what your work assignment was going to be?

05:18.702 --> 05:21.766
Well, the head of the department told you what you were teaching.

05:21.806 --> 05:25.070
And do you remember what your workload was in those early semesters?

05:25.971 --> 05:26.531
Three courses.

05:27.012 --> 05:28.293
Three per semester.

05:28.614 --> 05:31.577
Yeah, and maybe a couple of labs, too.

05:32.249 --> 05:49.409
When I was doing research for Lawrence Radiation Lab, and this was in the 60 to 63 period, at one time I was assigned three graduate courses and on payroll one third time.

05:50.810 --> 06:01.142
Now, this was common around this university in those days, because if you were doing research, you were really penalized for doing it.

06:02.422 --> 06:09.494
As you began, this is your first teaching assignment, is that right?

06:11.117 --> 06:11.738
At A&M?

06:11.998 --> 06:12.880
Yeah, boy.

06:13.661 --> 06:16.967
What was it like to prepare those lectures that first year?

06:18.008 --> 06:19.932
Describe your routine.

06:21.775 --> 06:24.379
It took quite a while to do it.

06:25.692 --> 06:29.015
I originally was from the North.

06:29.136 --> 06:30.057
Remember Spokane?

06:31.058 --> 06:31.818
You teach fast.

06:31.919 --> 06:32.940
You speak faster.

06:34.201 --> 06:41.048
I found out that I couldn't speak that fast because the students couldn't comprehend what I was talking about.

06:42.349 --> 06:45.453
So the first semester, they had a rough time.

06:46.374 --> 06:49.857
I covered probably twice as much material as I do now.

06:51.259 --> 06:53.421
Did any of them come to talk to you about it?

06:54.953 --> 06:55.794
In the Corps?

06:57.817 --> 07:00.261
I don't think so.

07:01.383 --> 07:07.913
See, the whole attitude has changed from when I was a student and they were a student.

07:07.933 --> 07:14.063
Nowadays, if you get out of line, you might have their lawyer come visit you, see?

07:14.143 --> 07:19.932
I haven't had that happen to me, but for instance, when I was in college,

07:21.616 --> 07:24.502
At Washington State, they didn't have tenure.

07:25.283 --> 07:40.452
They had it where you could come up towards the end of the semester, and the administration could give you what we called a pink slip, and you were gone right then.

07:42.035 --> 07:45.000
So, I was in a class.

07:46.122 --> 07:51.871
English literature had to be going into the final, and I thought I had aced the final.

07:54.195 --> 08:02.710
I got an F. I later found out that everybody in the class got an F. And nobody went and complained.

08:04.473 --> 08:07.097
Because that's one thing you didn't do in those days.

08:07.887 --> 08:10.451
Did you have a big survey course?

08:10.711 --> 08:13.255
What was the most basic course you started out teaching?

08:15.158 --> 08:22.830
Well, I taught the beginning geology course for a lot of periods here.

08:22.890 --> 08:26.195
And how big were the sections then?

08:26.977 --> 08:31.043
Well, they were about 100 to 150.

08:31.968 --> 08:43.720
The biggest section I probably taught was one that they talked over in Zachary, where I had 225 in the class.

08:44.861 --> 08:47.764
And that's too many.

08:48.745 --> 08:55.351
Now, the only way I handled that was I used what you call a buzz session.

08:56.993 --> 08:58.414
I'd get halfway through

08:59.457 --> 09:02.143
And the minute you start to feel unrest, you stop.

09:02.744 --> 09:04.548
Said, now we'll have a bus session.

09:04.568 --> 09:11.965
You can talk to your neighbor, to anybody else in here, but you can't ask me any questions.

09:15.387 --> 09:17.530
I did, let's say, five minutes.

09:18.171 --> 09:23.898
Then I'd go ahead, raise the board, put up some more outline on it, and then start again.

09:24.098 --> 09:26.181
You could hear a pin drop then.

09:27.303 --> 09:30.106
And, of course, that wasn't new with me.

09:30.226 --> 09:41.161
I found that out when I was attending one of the director's meetings for those summer programs that I ran for NSF.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.863
But it worked.

09:43.265 --> 09:49.330
In those early semesters, was there a senior colleague that you turned to for advice?

09:51.052 --> 09:54.875
Was there anybody that you turned to and say, hey, I've got a problem, what do I do next?

09:55.936 --> 09:56.416
Who'd you get?

09:56.737 --> 09:58.758
I don't remember that I did that.

09:58.778 --> 10:07.346
You see, when I was a TA, I sometimes substituted class so that I was sort of familiar with what goes on.

10:08.307 --> 10:12.090
Do you remember any Aggie pranks or jokes in those early years?

10:13.522 --> 10:16.826
Any tricks that anybody tried to play on anybody?

10:20.971 --> 10:22.633
Trying to think of who they did it with.

10:25.736 --> 10:35.348
Somebody made a remark about something and they had a whole room full of chicken feathers the next morning.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.330
Describe your teaching style.

10:37.430 --> 10:42.516
What did you try to accomplish the first day, the first week in the course?

10:43.627 --> 10:53.442
Well, I always have tried to tell them what's going to happen in the whole course and what we're going to cover as topics through the whole course.

10:55.605 --> 11:01.594
But nowadays, in the courses I teach, it's only a two-hour lecture.

11:01.614 --> 11:03.377
You have to cover a whole textbook.

11:03.577 --> 11:07.423
It's a little difficult.

11:08.602 --> 11:11.326
But I like people to be asked questions.

11:11.446 --> 11:13.510
If they don't, you wonder what's wrong.

11:14.792 --> 11:22.043
Because you can't, nobody can be that clear with what they're saying and presenting.

11:23.225 --> 11:27.511
And you were available in your office after class for?

11:27.952 --> 11:29.054
Oh, yes.

11:29.074 --> 11:30.336
Still am.

11:30.496 --> 11:32.719
Normally, when did you get to the campus?

11:32.799 --> 11:35.824
What time of day in those early years?

11:37.492 --> 11:38.373
Quarter to eight.

11:38.674 --> 11:39.415
Quarter to eight.

11:39.895 --> 11:41.638
And then we eat till five.

11:41.778 --> 11:42.399
Till five.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.925
And where did you and your departmental friends, where did you all eat lunch?

11:48.928 --> 11:50.250
I went home for lunch.

11:50.270 --> 11:51.512
Okay.

11:51.532 --> 11:54.636
And generally they went out for coffee in the morning.

11:55.197 --> 11:56.479
Where?

11:58.501 --> 12:04.751
Jones Drugstore, which used to be across by, it's now an Exxon station right next door.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.394
It isn't the drugstore anymore.

12:06.454 --> 12:09.399
I don't know what's there.

12:11.201 --> 12:13.966
Are you talking about at the Southside, at Southgate?

12:14.226 --> 12:14.687
Eastgate.

12:15.128 --> 12:15.589
At Eastgate.

12:15.669 --> 12:19.615
Oh, yeah.

12:23.071 --> 12:24.874
Did students come by?

12:24.914 --> 12:32.645
What was the most difficult, for a new teacher, what was the most difficult part for these students to understand?

12:32.665 --> 12:40.337
One, that you weren't going to raise their grade upon their request that they couldn't get by with that grade.

12:40.925 --> 12:59.401
Oh, no, I had some people even come out to my house and plead that they weren't going to be able to get into their junior year in the Corps unless I raised their grade to A. And I said, what do you want me to do, raise all the other people to A?

12:59.821 --> 13:01.144
Why, sure.

13:02.187 --> 13:03.689
Now, you didn't grade on the curve.

13:04.109 --> 13:05.030
Yes, I graded on the curve.

13:05.050 --> 13:05.451
Oh, you did?

13:05.991 --> 13:09.696
But one of the reasons I did was I still do today.

13:09.836 --> 13:21.189
I can't write a test that you can't get away without using a curve.

13:21.209 --> 13:25.514
Because you know there's questions that are difficult and those that aren't.

13:25.534 --> 13:29.038
And theoretically, if you use multiple choice questions,

13:30.858 --> 13:42.553
There ought to be one that's absolutely wrong, two that are partially right and going to trick most people into it, and one that is right.

13:44.516 --> 13:55.110
So, the A&M student described their general attitudes then.

13:55.370 --> 14:00.477
Well, let me say back then, the student was very provincial.

14:02.431 --> 14:13.568
You went to class and asked how many people had ever been out of state, you would maybe have one hand or maybe no come up.

14:13.588 --> 14:17.253
Nowadays, everybody's hand will be up.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.595
They've all been out of state.

14:18.615 --> 14:22.641
So they have—I think they have a different outlook.

14:23.182 --> 14:24.243
Were they respectful?

14:26.006 --> 14:26.747
Were they polite?

14:27.648 --> 14:30.092
They were when they were in the Corps, yes.

14:31.085 --> 14:36.882
Now, they didn't have to be in the Corps of the third and fourth year then.

14:36.923 --> 14:42.860
Did you have many civilian students from the junior and senior?

14:43.141 --> 14:43.362
No.

14:43.623 --> 14:44.706
So most all of them?

14:44.922 --> 14:53.075
And, well, see, we used to have a problem, too, with people in the Corps on field camp.

14:53.135 --> 14:57.382
Field camp was required, and it's between the junior and senior year.

14:59.125 --> 15:02.610
And the department head's attitude was, well,

15:02.945 --> 15:14.822
You either take the field camp or you're—they always wanted some way to get out of taking it because they had to go to the ROTC camp that summer.

15:16.384 --> 15:24.216
And the attitude of the department is, well, you're either going to want to be a general or be a geologist.

15:24.536 --> 15:28.041
You're going to have to make a choice.

15:28.612 --> 15:31.115
about how many chose to be a general instead?

15:31.555 --> 15:32.336
What percentage?

15:32.617 --> 15:33.137
Do you remember?

15:34.999 --> 15:37.743
No, I don't know what percent.

15:37.763 --> 15:44.450
I do know that here, oh, he graduated before I got here.

15:46.332 --> 15:54.602
But it was about 10 years, maybe 15 years ago, that we had a three-star Air Force.

15:54.768 --> 15:59.032
that had graduated in geology from A&M come back to make a visit.

16:01.194 --> 16:13.525
So I do know that in the 8th Air Force, there was only one Aggie Brigadier General that I knew of.

16:13.545 --> 16:17.649
Of course, I didn't know I was going to be an Aggie back then.

16:19.050 --> 16:21.973
Where was field camp held in the 50s?

16:22.072 --> 16:23.895
It was held at Junction.

16:23.915 --> 16:24.696
At Junction?

16:24.716 --> 16:25.798
Yeah.

16:25.818 --> 16:30.265
They generally made a trip for about three or four days out to Alpine.

16:30.986 --> 16:32.788
Did you ever go out there?

16:33.149 --> 16:33.449
Yes.

16:34.211 --> 16:36.975
Describe what field camp was like then.

16:39.078 --> 16:43.585
Well, have you ever been to Junction in those days?

16:44.146 --> 16:50.796
You know, you had those tent things and the faculty that was staying out there

16:50.911 --> 16:52.973
All stayed in one tent.

16:53.948 --> 17:07.087
And I thought that situation was a good one because it was set up so that a beginning freshman could come out there.

17:08.088 --> 17:13.937
It wouldn't normally not be accepted at Texas A&M and find out whether he can hack it.

17:15.339 --> 17:18.123
And so I thought they did a good job.

17:19.084 --> 17:23.010
About how many geology students went to field camp per summer?

17:23.463 --> 17:25.666
Oh, we'd have about 20 out there.

17:27.189 --> 17:32.477
And they would have, this would be between their junior, sophomore and junior?

17:32.577 --> 17:33.578
No, junior and senior.

17:33.598 --> 17:34.440
Junior and senior.

17:35.181 --> 17:35.281
Yeah.

17:35.301 --> 17:38.446
And these were geology majors.

17:38.466 --> 17:38.706
Right.

17:39.607 --> 17:46.438
And y'all were busy with them all day, six days a week or five?

17:47.419 --> 17:49.282
Six days out there.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.584
And it was...

17:52.083 --> 17:54.386
My gosh, some of the times we ran seven.

17:55.548 --> 17:56.950
And how many weeks?

17:58.432 --> 17:59.453
Ran for six weeks.

17:59.493 --> 18:00.074
Six weeks.

18:01.696 --> 18:06.022
And did they go into town much on the weekend, or did they stay out at camp?

18:06.042 --> 18:10.709
There wasn't much injunction to go into.

18:10.729 --> 18:13.112
Do you remember any pranks or jokes out there?

18:14.763 --> 18:27.657
No, but I was taking shots—diftheria, I think I was taking—because there was the thought that we had run a field trip to Mexico after that summer term was over.

18:28.918 --> 18:39.589
And all I know is, whatever those shots were, I got sick as a dog.

18:40.227 --> 18:45.473
So they had to even call the doctor out after, because I had a reaction to the shot.

18:45.493 --> 18:50.198
So, no, I remember that very well.

18:50.779 --> 18:53.102
Curley was— Austin Curley.

18:53.122 --> 18:53.842
It was out there.

18:54.423 --> 18:55.745
K-E-R-L-E-Y.

18:58.768 --> 19:07.618
But that was a good setup, and eventually the geology department built a seismic station out there.

19:08.932 --> 19:21.913
And our senator got outmaneuvered when that got transferred to Texas Tech.

19:21.933 --> 19:28.103
As you look back on it, was that program there, the field camp, was that well done, you think?

19:28.304 --> 19:29.185
Oh, yes.

19:30.818 --> 19:39.308
One of the problems is you have to be able to see things in the third dimension.

19:39.889 --> 19:43.734
You can't just normally see them without drawing them out.

19:43.794 --> 19:45.356
You're in trouble.

19:45.376 --> 19:53.586
And there's a lot of geologists that are not good people in terms of mapping, in terms of

19:55.388 --> 19:59.133
looking at that third dimension when they see the surface.

19:59.153 --> 20:04.040
What did you and your faculty colleagues do when you had any spare time?

20:04.581 --> 20:07.445
What did y'all do to relax in the summers out there?

20:09.729 --> 20:13.875
Well, I always had reading material with me.

20:13.895 --> 20:15.958
Incidentally, I'm a great reader anyway.

20:15.978 --> 20:16.919
I've always been.

20:18.922 --> 20:23.809
See, unfortunately for me in high school, I was able to get all

20:25.207 --> 20:30.514
my homework done in the study periods that we had in school.

20:30.534 --> 20:36.262
And so I always took home library books.

20:36.302 --> 20:41.008
So I made more library books than you can shake a stick at.

20:42.370 --> 20:47.036
And so I've always done a lot of reading.

20:47.197 --> 20:51.923
I still— And what were your favorite topics for reading?

20:54.232 --> 21:06.788
Well, one fellow I read about was Steinmetz, who made General Electric what it was, although he wasn't a businessman.

21:07.449 --> 21:11.615
So, more history than fiction?

21:12.095 --> 21:14.198
Yeah, more history than fiction.

21:14.178 --> 21:25.774
Now, out there, if you wanted to go into Junction on Saturday night, was there a movie available?

21:26.075 --> 21:27.056
What could you?

21:27.818 --> 21:31.142
I don't know.

21:31.262 --> 21:37.712
All I know is that the geology department had vehicles out there, and so did civil engineering.

21:37.732 --> 21:41.257
They ran a summer camp out there, too.

21:41.297 --> 21:47.025
But you wouldn't want to take a state vehicle in to drink beer.

21:47.065 --> 21:48.367
Well, that's right.

21:50.090 --> 21:51.812
Let's come back to

21:51.995 --> 22:00.548
the town, describe what it was like for you and your wife to settle in here to join this community.

22:00.588 --> 22:07.398
What was it like to be a newcomer in College Station in the mid-'50s?

22:10.383 --> 22:17.614
Well, it was, we were in the middle of drought here too, so everything was dry.

22:18.100 --> 22:27.490
Nowadays, the university does a lot of sprinkling of their lawns, but in those days, they didn't.

22:29.993 --> 22:47.331
And we stayed in a motel, not a very top-rate one, because we didn't know how long we were going to be there, and then started to look for rental property, and we were looking in the paper.

22:49.100 --> 22:59.692
And a gentleman, when we were starting to pull up from one way, honked a horn and stopped us, said, are you looking for a place to rent?

22:59.712 --> 23:00.073
Yes.

23:00.233 --> 23:04.137
I said, I'm coming here to teach in Texas A&M.

23:05.579 --> 23:14.689
And he says, well, I have a place that's just come up empty, and I'd like you to look at it.

23:14.709 --> 23:17.993
He was a fellow, the name was Brown.

23:19.289 --> 23:29.384
and was the Brown of Brown and Allen, which Allen eventually took over completely when Brown retired.

23:31.708 --> 23:34.272
Do you remember what the rent was on that first apartment?

23:34.292 --> 23:36.595
No, no, I sure don't.

23:36.615 --> 23:37.216
Where was it?

23:38.999 --> 23:41.162
It's right where

23:44.551 --> 23:58.718
on Cooner Street, and the bank that's in there, that property was taken over by the bank, so that no house there anymore.

23:58.738 --> 24:07.555
And how did the neighborhood, how did the other departmental families receive a newcomer?

24:08.260 --> 24:18.217
Was there anything to help you all become... No, no general thing, but the thing is that most people were pretty friendly anyway.

24:18.839 --> 24:24.509
See, there was another new fellow about, Daylinger, came in about the same time, Peter Daylinger.

24:25.711 --> 24:29.778
And as far as... We got together occasionally.

24:30.679 --> 24:32.783
As far as you could tell...

24:32.763 --> 24:40.974
Was the cost of living and groceries and everything else here, was it different than what you had known, where you moved from, or not?

24:41.755 --> 24:42.956
Well, let's put it this way.

24:45.059 --> 24:47.682
This was a very friendly place in those days.

24:48.303 --> 24:48.663
Oh, good.

24:49.024 --> 24:49.124
Good.

24:49.144 --> 24:50.986
And you had no problems.

24:51.127 --> 24:58.416
I'd say the cost of living was probably lower than it was in... See, I came here from Miami, Florida, and...

24:58.885 --> 25:00.667
Cost of living was probably lower here.

25:01.127 --> 25:07.413
And the summer heat seemed more oppressive here?

25:07.473 --> 25:14.179
It's always been oppressive, but nowadays we have air conditioning.

25:15.020 --> 25:17.523
I would rather tolerate the heat than the cold.

25:18.143 --> 25:18.724
I would too.

25:18.924 --> 25:25.450
I never did like snow, and one of the last years I was in Pullman, Washington,

25:27.910 --> 25:31.756
It never got above freezing for about three months.

25:32.197 --> 25:36.604
The accumulation of snow that winter was about three foot.

25:38.266 --> 25:42.874
And I don't like snow.

25:42.894 --> 25:46.579
So I'd rather tolerate heat.

25:47.761 --> 25:49.284
Describe the campus then.

25:50.486 --> 25:52.669
What was the A&M campus like?

25:54.067 --> 26:01.579
Well, being a groundwater geologist, one of the things I noticed that there were some old pump houses here.

26:02.200 --> 26:04.144
We were not using the water.

26:05.706 --> 26:11.175
However, somebody asked me, oh, about—it's about 20 years ago.

26:12.197 --> 26:18.808
I'm drilling a well, and there is a well

26:20.257 --> 26:25.902
that is next to the geology building when the petroleum engineering building was built there.

26:27.163 --> 26:33.249
It goes down about 200 feet to tap that same aquifer.

26:33.269 --> 26:44.359
But they abandoned that and used a well field out at the old airfield because that water was terrible.

26:45.179 --> 26:48.002
Well, it was slightly salty.

26:48.590 --> 26:51.032
and high in hydrogen sulfide.

26:51.052 --> 26:52.514
That's the campus well.

26:52.614 --> 26:54.436
Campus wells.

26:54.456 --> 26:56.818
So you had to hold your nose to drink it.

26:57.539 --> 27:02.043
But I guess if you're in the car and that's all you got to drink, that's what you'll drink.

27:02.884 --> 27:04.106
But they weren't being used.

27:04.206 --> 27:08.870
They hadn't eliminated the well houses yet when I got here.

27:09.391 --> 27:16.558
But in terms of appearance, what did, other than being brown and the grass dry, what did the campus look like?

27:16.618 --> 27:18.580
Was it attractive?

27:19.454 --> 27:21.537
Were there trees?

27:21.557 --> 27:31.589
Now, there are some people that are architecturally highly critical of our campus, because we have a diverse set of buildings.

27:32.910 --> 27:37.095
It certainly wasn't as built up as it is now.

27:37.155 --> 27:45.225
The chemistry building has been added onto, and of course, so has the

27:45.543 --> 27:49.529
The geology, used to be geology, petroleum engineering.

27:51.772 --> 27:53.695
It's been added on to on the back.

27:54.937 --> 28:00.865
And when I first came here, you got a parking spot signed to it.

28:00.885 --> 28:05.953
You didn't have to pay for it.

28:05.973 --> 28:08.817
And— Did you lock your car even then?

28:10.299 --> 28:11.581
No, I do now.

28:12.001 --> 28:13.103
But you didn't then.

28:13.522 --> 28:16.286
I didn't lock my house when I first arrived here.

28:16.306 --> 28:16.867
I do now.

28:18.970 --> 28:21.914
What kind of office were you given that first year?

28:23.396 --> 28:31.308
I shared it with a fellow that left the next year for Occidental.

28:33.811 --> 28:39.900
And then the next year after that I shared it with King.

28:42.108 --> 28:44.130
And did you all lock the office?

28:45.151 --> 28:45.652
Oh, yeah.

28:45.672 --> 28:46.012
You did?

28:46.173 --> 28:46.533
Okay.

28:47.834 --> 28:49.636
I did because I had tests.

28:49.656 --> 28:54.202
Ah, yes.

28:54.482 --> 29:05.314
When did, in the 1950s, there was a brief period when the Corps was optional for a year or two.

29:05.851 --> 29:08.174
And then it went back to being compulsory.

29:08.734 --> 29:10.877
Do you remember that making any difference?

29:10.897 --> 29:12.999
No, I don't remember that period.

29:13.780 --> 29:22.650
See, when I went through college, I went to Washington State, which is an A&M.

29:22.991 --> 29:24.152
A land grant.

29:24.953 --> 29:28.617
In those days, they all had ROTC.

29:29.578 --> 29:33.883
And it was at my university, the first two years were compulsory.

29:34.977 --> 29:38.764
Well, I couldn't qualify the other three if I'd wanted to do it.

29:42.711 --> 29:48.441
In the late 50s, Mr. Rutter came over as the new president.

29:49.122 --> 29:51.947
Do you remember any talk about that?

29:52.027 --> 29:56.295
Was there any reaction among you and your colleagues to his selection?

29:56.315 --> 29:58.639
Well, I think the reaction in the beginning

30:00.796 --> 30:05.641
was how can somebody that hasn't been in academia run academia?

30:06.181 --> 30:07.022
Turned out he could.

30:08.203 --> 30:18.193
But what most people forgot was that he had a public office where he was working with problems that were pretty diverse.

30:20.675 --> 30:25.600
Do you remember when you and your colleagues first heard him speak or saw him?

30:25.980 --> 30:28.643
Any discussion, any recollections of that?

30:29.264 --> 30:46.354
No, but I do remember when Zachary made a speech to us that they had us there for a dinner, the only faculty for your regents dinner that's been held.

30:46.374 --> 30:51.864
And I remember Zachary talking to us.

30:52.485 --> 30:54.428
We were employees.

30:57.361 --> 31:00.809
When he got through speaking, there wasn't a single clap.

31:01.711 --> 31:03.234
Why, do you remember that too?

31:04.998 --> 31:07.604
That was in Cebiza, wasn't it?

31:07.624 --> 31:08.265
Cebiza, yes.

31:09.588 --> 31:12.535
And I vowed then I'd never go to another one.
