WEBVTT

00:00:02.326 --> 00:00:06.575
choice other than through the kinds of mentors that we provide.

00:00:07.877 --> 00:00:10.583
But should primary care be kind of...

00:00:10.603 --> 00:00:14.571
I think that primary care is a well-stated primary objective.

00:00:15.392 --> 00:00:19.120
If we can achieve it, fine, but we cannot tell our graduates what to do.

00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:29.478
One of the things I realize I have not asked you about, were there women in the first class?

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.681
Oh, yes.

00:00:31.563 --> 00:00:33.347
I don't remember the number.

00:00:33.387 --> 00:00:36.574
We could look at the photograph of the charter class to see.

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:38.899
So there weren't any first women?

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:40.062
Oh, no.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:52.989
Do you remember any particular events that were centered around the fact that there were men and women in the class?

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.613
No, I don't have any.

00:00:55.753 --> 00:00:57.696
Was there a pioneer minority student?

00:01:03.852 --> 00:01:07.496
I don't remember that issue at all.

00:01:07.556 --> 00:01:11.500
Minorities gradually infiltrated.

00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:12.782
That's not a good word.

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:18.828
But we gradually did incorporate minority groups into the admissions.

00:01:18.928 --> 00:01:32.323
I think the charter class and maybe the next couple of classes who were drawn exclusively from A&M were not a very diverse group.

00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:39.830
But you're also implying there were no problems of race, gender, ethnicity?

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.252
Not that I have ever perceived.

00:01:41.692 --> 00:01:43.575
I would have been surprised if there had been.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.121
Okay.

00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:51.145
I've got two more questions I can think of other than this one.

00:01:52.206 --> 00:01:54.169
What have we not touched on that we should have?

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:56.412
What have we skipped over, left out?

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:01.839
Hmm.

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.939
Hmm.

00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:05.007
I don't know.

00:02:05.908 --> 00:02:07.050
I don't know what to say.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:16.545
The other two that I can think of, let's make believe someone walks up to you and gives you a check for a million dollars with only one requirement.

00:02:16.926 --> 00:02:22.054
You must pass it on to Texas A&M, but you can decide the use to be made.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:30.512
If you were capable of making a large financial gift to A&M, what would you want done with that money?

00:02:31.653 --> 00:02:36.020
What would be your favorite addition?

00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:39.625
I don't think that I would do anything different from what I've already done.

00:02:41.247 --> 00:02:51.923
And I'm not bragging here, Haskell, or I don't mean to, but I have committed personally about a half million

00:02:52.375 --> 00:02:56.058
to this university for specific projects.

00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:04.646
One of those is to honor the charter speaker of the university's faculty senate.

00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:10.512
It carries the name that John J. McDermott, a speakership of the university faculty senate.

00:03:10.532 --> 00:03:14.115
It is an endowment that upon my death will be worth several hundred thousand dollars.

00:03:16.117 --> 00:03:21.522
I have endowed a lectureship in the history of medicine for this department in memory of my wife.

00:03:22.683 --> 00:03:29.732
I just delivered a few days ago the inaugural lecture in another lecture series that I endowed, the George C.Y.

00:03:29.893 --> 00:03:31.515
Cho Lectureship in Pharmacology.

00:03:33.297 --> 00:03:35.840
And I wouldn't change those for the world.

00:03:37.282 --> 00:03:48.437
I have recently completed an endowment for the Anthony van Leeuwenhoek Award for Excellence in Microbiology, which goes to a graduating senior who has excelled in microbiology.

00:03:49.126 --> 00:04:05.389
And again, upon my death, there will be a very substantial pot of money to construct this courtyard just outside of my window, the Robert S. and Mary Elizabeth Stone Pavilion.

00:04:07.492 --> 00:04:10.436
The courtyard was Bob's creation.

00:04:15.083 --> 00:04:18.087
He saw in his original concept for the courtyard

00:04:19.012 --> 00:04:33.983
a shelter of some kind from the texas summer sun and when the courtyard came into implementation it ran out of money before the pavilion could be constructed so i'm very happy that i can meet that

00:04:35.043 --> 00:04:35.804
part of his dream.

00:04:36.525 --> 00:04:39.569
I've done almost exactly 150 interviews.

00:04:39.609 --> 00:04:50.205
I've asked that same question to everyone, and you're one of the few that has been able to answer it by saying, this is what I've done.

00:04:50.225 --> 00:04:56.253
The last one, then, is almost superfluous.

00:04:56.433 --> 00:04:59.858
What feelings do you hold in your heart for this institution?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.645
Haskell, I absolutely love Texas A&M University.

00:05:06.127 --> 00:05:14.335
And I feel, with the separation of the College of Medicine from the university, a kind of disenfranchisement.

00:05:16.598 --> 00:05:18.820
I have just completed 25 years of service.

00:05:20.502 --> 00:05:25.867
Last Friday, I was recognized for 25 years of service to the Health Science Center, which isn't 25 years old.

00:05:26.568 --> 00:05:31.994
I would have much preferred to get that recognition from the university, which I truly, truly love.

00:05:33.335 --> 00:05:34.176
Let's quit there.
