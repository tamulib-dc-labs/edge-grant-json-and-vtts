WEBVTT

00:01.111 --> 00:04.316
I need to get a job, right? So I went to apply at the 
telephone company because at the time the

00:05.397 --> 00:13.028
telephone company was hiring people. And, you 
know, you went through all this bunch of testing

00:13.909 --> 00:18.896
and stuff that they did. And we had to figure out how 
to add one plus one and all that kind of stuff. And,

00:22.761 --> 00:27.468
you know, all this kind of rinkity testing that 
they did. And then I got to see an interviewer. And

00:29.900 --> 00:48.800
his interviewer basically told me that he was 
going to conduct this interview because he had to,

00:29.900 --> 00:48.800
but that I wasn't going to get hired because I was a 
Vietnam veteran and that they wouldn't hire

00:29.900 --> 00:48.800
Vietnam veterans because they were afraid that we 
were going to run amok and kill people. Well, that

00:49.441 --> 00:50.702
didn't sit real well. I thought, do what? You know, 
so there was a lot of, I don't think the public

00:55.195 --> 01:00.741
reaction to us was very favorable. And we couldn't 
understand that. That was one of the biggest

01:01.882 --> 01:09.629
problems that came about with, is that every other 
war, American soldiers were the pride of their

01:01.882 --> 01:09.629
country. And here we were like the ugly red-headed 
stepchild. You know, nobody wanted us. We were

01:16.056 --> 01:18.819
lepers, you know. And we felt like, you know, why 
were we lepers? You know, we had done what you

01:23.143 --> 01:25.185
asked. You know, we went and fought in a war we 
didn't even believe in. We died. Or we came home,

01:31.485 --> 01:36.513
shot all the pieces, and you still treat us like 
we're trash. And I can understand to some extent

01:36.874 --> 01:43.284
some of the people's disillusionment and some of 
their anger. But, you know, a lot of... I'll tell

01:47.411 --> 01:48.553
you what it's like. It's kind of like you see a guy 
that... He commits a crime, and he's an ex-police

01:53.448 --> 01:55.671
officer. He may have been a police officer 25 years 
ago, but it will always read, ex-cop does this.

02:06.003 --> 02:08.145
It's always, too. Vietnam was 20 years ago, right? 
It'll read, vet does this. I mean, you're always

02:15.614 --> 02:17.376
stigmatized. It's the same with being an 
American. If you come from another country to

02:20.920 --> 02:28.482
America and you're Chinese, after a period of time 
here, you're an American. But you can go from

02:28.502 --> 02:33.255
America to any other country in the world and you 
will always be an American. No matter how long you

02:33.275 --> 02:36.043
live there, you will always be an American. You can 
become a citizen there if you want, but you will

02:36.395 --> 02:39.900
always be a American. Same way. Ex-Vietnam 
veteran, runs amok, kills 35 women and children,

02:41.362 --> 02:48.232
takes bus, has hand grenades, you know, whatever. 
But it will always be not that Joe Smith did this,

02:48.593 --> 02:53.179
but ex-Vietnam vet. Okay? Now, that doesn't 
justify it in my mind. Like what Barrett says in his

02:57.966 --> 03:02.132
book about... Another book that was written 
called Charlie Company that I suspect that a lot of

03:02.399 --> 03:08.308
people that came back with problems had problems 
when they went over. You know, and that they used

03:09.390 --> 03:12.775
the war as their own crutch. You know, people were 
prone to doing that. And that's, you know, they,

03:17.262 --> 03:24.913
you know, I got my mind messed up because I was in 
Vietnam and all wrong. Your mind was messed up when

03:25.094 --> 03:28.018
you went there, you know. or people that, I know 
some people today, 20 years later, okay, that, in

03:28.471 --> 03:39.423
fact, my brother-in-law is one, okay, that you 
say, can I talk to you about Vietnam? I don't want to

03:39.443 --> 03:41.065
talk about Vietnam. That's a very personal thing, 
you know. Oh, man, get serious. You know, it's

03:45.250 --> 03:47.232
over. The war is over. It's passed. It's not 
something you're proud of. It's not something

03:51.016 --> 03:54.580
you're particularly ashamed of either. But if 
it's that personal with you, I think there's

03:55.319 --> 04:00.665
something wrong with you to start with. I've heard 
some vets say, though, that they wanted to talk

04:01.526 --> 04:11.979
about it to their close friends and their close 
friends didn't want to hear anything about it,

04:01.526 --> 04:11.979
wanted to ignore it totally and pretend that 
nothing had happened. That's true. I know some

04:13.380 --> 04:17.485
people that that's true. I went and I was in college 
when I went to Vietnam. My problem was that most of

04:21.847 --> 04:28.499
my friends went to Vietnam and got killed, and so 
there weren't too many people to talk about it. But

04:30.282 --> 04:38.337
a lot of people that you still knew, that when you 
came back to the university or something, that

04:30.282 --> 04:38.337
were your friends and stuff. They didn't want to 
talk to you. They didn't want to be seen with a

04:40.062 --> 04:41.984
Vietnam vet. Or they were just uncomfortable. 
They didn't know how to deal. Because the burning

04:46.668 --> 04:51.492
question in everybody's mind was always, how many 
people did he kill? Did he kill women and children?

04:54.955 --> 04:56.357
This is a friend of mine. Was he one of those guys 
that bayoneted little babies? And they didn't

05:02.062 --> 05:08.087
know how to ask you that.

05:09.080 --> 05:14.066
They knew they couldn't ask you that, but they knew 
they needed to know, and they were uncomfortable.

05:14.707 --> 05:20.435
So they just kind of, if I stay away from them 
altogether, I won't have to face that issue. You'd

05:21.456 --> 05:25.762
be surprised, even today, people will come up and 
say, were you in Vietnam? Yeah. Next question, how

05:26.382 --> 05:28.766
many people did you kill? That's like, how many 
times have you beat your wife? I mean, you're

05:33.351 --> 05:36.876
guilty by association, you know. What do you feel 
is the most important thing that you've learned

05:38.695 --> 05:45.401
from your experience and how has it most affected 
your life? How has it most affected my life? What

05:47.783 --> 05:49.625
have I learned from my experience? I learned to 
stay alive.

05:54.829 --> 05:55.570
What have I learned?

05:59.233 --> 06:07.420
I don't know that really I learned much other than 
not to just believe every word that pours out of the

05:59.233 --> 06:07.420
mouth of government. In fact, I probably learned 
to be quite the opposite side, to disbelieve most

06:07.822 --> 06:16.753
everything they say, which might or might not be a 
real healthy thing.

06:20.597 --> 06:27.485
I learned, too, that other people have different 
ways, and that doesn't make them any better or any

06:20.597 --> 06:27.485
worse than me. It just makes them different from 
me. But that we still share the common denominator

06:31.150 --> 06:34.554
of being people. I learned that I basically have 
learned that the American military could

06:38.635 --> 06:51.170
probably blow this planet to pieces if it wasn't 
held in check and that we really should keep an eye

06:38.635 --> 06:51.170
on that. I've learned that war is not the way to 
solve a problem.

06:59.360 --> 07:05.908
I have seen in my lifetime, and in fact in the class 
that we're in, Some of the people that we have there

07:06.260 --> 07:21.910
almost feel like they were unlucky because they 
weren't born at a time when they could go test their

07:06.260 --> 07:21.910
notions of democracy or something. And I've 
learned that the worst way of solving anything is

07:21.930 --> 07:28.723
to fight in war.

07:32.922 --> 07:35.004
that we've got to find a better way. We just have got 
to find a better way. And basically I've learned

07:38.867 --> 07:44.492
the biggest thing is that I just don't trust 
government at all. That's what my experience

07:44.512 --> 07:46.294
taught me. How has it affected my life? Well, it's 
obviously affected it in those areas. I don't

07:50.317 --> 07:52.319
trust government. I've also learned probably, 
though, that if this is truly a government for the

07:53.360 --> 08:01.647
people and all that, that them to prevent that from 
happening again is that you have got to get out

08:02.015 --> 08:21.677
there and take part of it right or wrong you know 
you've got to get out there and do your part you know

08:02.015 --> 08:21.677
to uh to keep it from happening again hopefully 
okay why do you think that we lost Why did we lose?

08:23.400 --> 08:25.122
Because we didn't win.

08:28.807 --> 08:31.851
We lost because we didn't understand that we 
couldn't win. We lost because we had a notion of a

08:33.934 --> 08:38.340
limited war. We lost because we had a notion of 
American invincibility. We lost because we think

08:43.607 --> 08:49.555
that we have... the locks on the moral game, that we 
had this mission to spread democracy and

08:50.733 --> 08:59.826
capitalism throughout the world. We lost because 
we were basically naive and stupid about the other

09:00.707 --> 09:07.137
peoples of the world. We lost because we didn't 
understand that Ho Chi Minh's nationalism and Ho

09:07.177 --> 09:20.436
Chi Minh himself and his charisma was far stronger 
in Vietnam than our military.

09:23.015 --> 09:29.921
We lost because we didn't understand that the 
Vietnamese people were just tired of fighting and

09:23.015 --> 09:29.921
that they weren't going to fight. They knew that 
the French had been defeated. They knew that we

09:35.126 --> 09:37.508
ultimately would be defeated. They didn't want to 
get in there and fight and die for no reason. They

09:43.534 --> 09:44.675
just were tired. All they wanted to do was 
basically the same thing, stay out of the way until

09:44.695 --> 09:51.621
the war was over, and then they could go on about 
doing their lives and their things. And they would

09:52.546 --> 09:56.250
just try to stay out of the way. They saw no real need 
to fight. It's

09:58.553 --> 10:04.400
just a totally different culture. We lost because 
we didn't understand the culture. Another reason

10:08.685 --> 10:12.049
we lost is because we think we lost. We think we 
lost. We never lost a battle. Militarily, we never

10:17.285 --> 10:20.932
lost a battle in Vietnam. We won every engagement 
that we were ever in. Insofar as the numbers game,

10:25.542 --> 10:33.618
we lost 57,000 something, 58,000 soldiers. We 
killed over a million people. Those are some real

10:36.103 --> 10:38.989
odds. We lost because we perceive it to be a loss. 
And I suspect that the reason for that is, as I was

10:43.186 --> 10:57.925
reading Stanley Carnell's book, that he comes up 
with a kind of a unique definition of war, I

10:43.186 --> 10:57.925
thought, was that defeat is when stated 
objectives are not achieved. Okay? Well, our

11:00.046 --> 11:06.413
stated objective was to make South Vietnam a free 
government like the United States, and it didn't

11:00.046 --> 11:06.413
happen. So we perceive it as a loss. Militarily, we 
were not defeated. Militarily, in fact, we

11:12.140 --> 11:17.626
probably would have won had we have really stayed 
with it. But we lost because we thought we lost. We

11:19.769 --> 11:21.330
defeated ourselves. Do you feel that we've 
learned from our mistakes? No. No, I don't. And the

11:30.455 --> 11:37.002
people at large, I don't think that we've learned. 
I see the American notion of exceptionalism

11:37.022 --> 11:40.967
creeping back in. Even

11:41.507 --> 11:45.051
before that. I think it probably came about during 
Jimmy Carter's administration that everybody

11:45.572 --> 11:51.478
else kind of thinks that I'm crazy. But I saw the 
human rights issue, the United States doing its

11:54.805 --> 12:00.672
moral stumping again. And it doesn't appear to me 
to be very long after the United States does its

12:02.154 --> 12:11.485
moral stumping that it does its political 
stumping and its military stumping. I have a total

12:12.726 --> 12:18.593
different view over the Reagan administration 
than most people did. I think that Reagan's an

12:18.613 --> 12:21.657
actor. Okay, apparently he's very good, should 
have won an Academy Award if he didn't. I don't know

12:25.780 --> 12:31.586
whether he did or not, but I think that Reagan was 
one of those people that you called like dumb like a

12:25.780 --> 12:31.586
fox. Okay, I think that Reagan was a hell of a lot 
smarter than we give him credit for. I think that he

12:38.213 --> 12:48.724
built up the military and spent so many dollars in 
the military and so much money in the one area that

12:38.213 --> 12:48.724
the United States cannot be beaten in, the area of 
technology development. No one has ever been able

12:49.497 --> 12:52.442
to beat us, even the Japanese. The Japanese don't 
come up with the technology. They buy it from us,

12:54.325 --> 13:01.497
and then they just make millions of things cheaper 
than we can make them, but they can't develop the

12:54.325 --> 13:01.497
technology. We do. Reagan knew that SDI was a 
technological wonder or would be. He painted that

13:09.350 --> 13:14.138
picture, this big technological thing. And that 
left it kind of open-ended as to how much it was

13:14.742 --> 13:18.427
going to cost. It was like a blank check. And what 
that told the Soviets were that they're 10 years

13:20.210 --> 13:31.065
behind us in technology, that they were going to 
have to spend at least as much, and probably more,

13:20.210 --> 13:31.065
because they've got to catch up on 10 years. And 
their economy was shot. Reagan knew it, and so he

13:32.988 --> 13:36.413
actually forced them to bargain. I would defend 
that on the argument that all Mikhail Gorbachev

13:36.865 --> 13:45.578
has asked for is get rid of SDI, cut military. All he 
wants to do is not have to expend the money on his

13:47.961 --> 13:57.234
military because it's going to kill his country, 
and he knows it. His domestic economy is in such a

13:57.715 --> 14:02.502
shambles because they've drawn so much money into 
their military. And that's all he wants, to get rid

14:02.768 --> 14:05.471
of this SDI notion. And so I think that Reagan was 
quite right in that negotiate through strength.

14:11.277 --> 14:13.140
Now, it's also a real gutty proposal. If it blows up 
in your face, your whole world blows up. But I think

14:17.404 --> 14:21.008
it was probably a good poker game. And I feel like 
Reagan would have really backed down, had it

14:21.989 --> 14:29.738
looked like we were going to have another Cuban 
Missile Crisis type event. that you don't know

14:30.308 --> 14:34.095
whether tomorrow you're going to wake up or be 
bombed into the Stone Age. I think Reagan would

14:34.536 --> 14:35.939
have backed down. I think he played a good bluff and 
he won.

14:41.970 --> 14:48.182
American moralism is still, I think, rampant 
throughout the world.

14:49.478 --> 14:53.129
All right, do we understand peoples of other 
cultures? No. Find me somebody in the world that

14:53.831 --> 15:03.319
doesn't want to go bomb the Ayatollah into the 
Stone Age or bomb Muammar Gaddafi into the Stone

14:53.831 --> 15:03.319
Age.

15:05.189 --> 15:16.366
Forget about the fact that the Shah of Iran was one 
of the most horrible dictators in Iran and had a

15:05.189 --> 15:16.366
secret police that just, you know, did away with 
political dissidents. We forget about that part,

15:16.406 --> 15:18.709
the Shah. Now, I don't particularly like the Shah 
either, but, you know, I mean, we still have this,

15:19.450 --> 15:33.812
you know, real view of American exceptionalism 
and American moralism that we're right and nobody

15:19.450 --> 15:33.812
else in the world is. in the way that we treat the 
Soviet Union. That we're going to tie aid to

15:39.399 --> 15:44.905
countries, especially the Soviet Union. We want 
Mikhail to win. We want his country to become

15:47.188 --> 15:49.830
democratized. But he's got to do certain things in 
order to... The notion is that we tie our aid to

15:54.676 --> 16:01.403
certain... Why do we do that to Mexico when we give 
aid to them? Well, I've heard the statement, no,

16:02.108 --> 16:08.336
but Mexico is not the adversary that the Soviet 
Union is. I make the statement that we really don't

16:08.356 --> 16:10.699
have much choice. What's the alternative? A 
U.S.-Soviet confrontation? Nobody's going to

16:14.924 --> 16:16.446
win out of that. No, I don't think we've learned 
anything. At the time, I think we probably, and for

16:22.995 --> 16:30.124
a few years after, were convinced that...

16:32.247 --> 16:38.533
You know, that America was not invincible, but I 
think we're coming back to that notion here in the

16:32.247 --> 16:38.533
last few years. You know, and I worry about it. You 
know, I don't want my children to have to go up and,

16:42.517 --> 16:47.862
you know, that's a lot of money raising these kids. 
And I don't want my children to have to go out and,

16:49.504 --> 16:58.693
you know, raise them and then have them die off in a 
war that whether it's right or wrong, you know. I

16:59.517 --> 17:01.080
mean, I want like every other parent. I want them to 
grow up and be happy and wealthy and have a bunch of

17:01.100 --> 17:07.994
kids and enjoy life and enjoy their country. I 
don't like the prospects of it not being that way.

17:14.869 --> 17:17.414
Well, I guess you have anything else to add? That's 
it. Thank you. You bet.
