WEBVTT

00:02.697 --> 00:07.946
But I think it was also the singing and setting up of 
the bonfire. All of that was just such a treat

00:08.046 --> 00:14.096
because never had she experienced something like 
that before. All right. That first year, you

00:15.137 --> 00:19.785
didn't encounter any hazing then. No. You weren't 
a fish in the normal sense of the word. No, I didn't,

00:25.664 --> 00:34.114
but I think I began to hear about, I mean, I knew I had 
some freshmen, and I knew I had friends of mine that

00:25.664 --> 00:34.114
were fish. A lot of my classmates from Bryan did not 
join the Corps, though I saw them occasionally,

00:35.015 --> 00:54.439
but I guess those schoolmates of mine that ended up 
going, I remember them, and I saw them in their

00:35.015 --> 00:54.439
uniform and short hair and kind of in their state of 
shock at first.

01:01.124 --> 01:08.445
I guess the other thing that I remember quite 
vividly was during the cutting of Bonfire, how

01:01.124 --> 01:08.445
many of them were just was just dozing off in class. 
So it was those kinds of experiences that I did

01:12.171 --> 01:19.038
remember, at least from seeing the students. All 
right, describe, you went to class on Monday,

01:19.058 --> 01:22.581
Wednesday, and Friday. Describe that day. You got 
up at what time, came to campus, did what, and so

01:26.926 --> 01:30.629
forth. I usually would get up probably about, my 
class was usually about 8 o'clock. I'd try to get up

01:35.474 --> 01:38.297
as early as possible so we could get out by 12. I 
imagine we got about a quarter to seven, got ready,

01:38.699 --> 01:46.249
and of course just lived in West Bryan and just take 
on Finn Feather. I could get to school in about 10,

01:46.329 --> 01:48.492
15 minutes. And parking was not a big deal. Yeah, 
where did you park? I parked across from the drill

01:52.918 --> 02:06.816
field, that parking lot that still exists there, 
and

01:52.918 --> 02:06.816
walked the academic building, Nagel Hall, where 
most of my classes were. And then where would lunch

02:09.708 --> 02:11.030
be? Lunch would be back home, probably, because we 
would eat right before we went to work, and so my mom

02:11.811 --> 02:24.791
would have us some lunch, and then she'd give us a 
sack lunch for dinner, where we would eat. But

02:24.911 --> 02:30.059
there was my brother, Moises, and I, and another 
friend named Mario. The three of us pretty much had

02:31.902 --> 02:35.267
the same routine, so we'd We'd see each other 
getting our cars leaving or whatever about the

02:35.703 --> 02:39.947
same time. I did start getting involved with 
school stuff later, but when I guess I started

02:39.967 --> 02:56.342
being able to work a little less, and so I had more 
time to do that. Right. Was your freshman spring

02:58.284 --> 03:04.950
semester about a repeat of the fall in terms of 
the... You took... Another 12, 13 hours. And,

03:07.703 --> 03:12.530
you know, I was always a full-time student. And 
then I think two or three of my summers, I ended up

03:13.691 --> 03:16.275
going to summer school. Right. Do you remember 
what your major was those first two semesters? My

03:20.380 --> 03:21.882
first semester, it was history. Why? Because I had 
always liked history. I had thought of

03:27.330 --> 03:31.095
anthropology at some time, but it never really 
gels. And then when political science department

03:34.613 --> 03:37.357
sprung from history, I guess it was. Then I went 
into the political science, but I started with

03:38.559 --> 03:41.022
history. What did you think your career was going 
to be? What did you hope you were going to... Well, I

03:43.826 --> 03:47.812
had thought of being a lawyer at that time. Why? 
Well, I guess I began to get into my courses. At that

03:56.704 --> 04:01.431
time, the Hispanic movement was beginning to get 
The notion of young Hispanics becoming lawyers or

04:02.052 --> 04:10.440
doctors and promoting those professions became 
more and more. I guess I began to see myself as

04:10.801 --> 04:16.446
someone who could become a lawyer. I started 
thinking about that, but I thought about it more

04:16.606 --> 04:21.791
seriously. Was there a person that was a role model 
that you now realize? Somebody that, oh, he or she

04:27.056 --> 04:30.760
is a lawyer, I'd like to be like... No, because 
quite frankly, in Bryan, I

04:31.347 --> 04:41.058
didn't know really any lawyers. I knew some of the 
judges here. My brothers and I started going to a

04:43.641 --> 04:50.329
prayer meeting early when I was nine years old. We 
didn't know the men that personally, but they were

04:50.369 --> 04:56.035
Judge Barron and some of the others, Judge Davis, 
W.C. Davis. No, I can't say that there was one

04:57.937 --> 05:00.460
person who inspired me to say, you can be a lawyer or 
you ought to be a lawyer. I just wanted to achieve. I

05:09.250 --> 05:13.295
wanted to do the best I could and to be successful. 
How did you dress in those days as an Aggie

05:14.837 --> 05:19.284
freshman? Well, blue jeans and

05:19.304 --> 05:24.831
shirts. I mean, T-shirts or... Not T-shirts, but 
it was another... It had shirts with... Because we

05:31.237 --> 05:34.141
had some bell-bottom pants, but they weren't that 
bell-bottom. But mainly blue jeans, you know, and

05:35.963 --> 05:41.410
shirt. And were you clean-shaven then? I had,

05:44.494 --> 05:51.363
well, yes, I had a mustache. As a freshman? No, my 
mustache came, I think, when I was like a sophomore

05:55.148 --> 05:58.112
or junior. I think that's when it began. And

06:01.004 --> 06:09.433
why, I think my older brother started wearing a 
mustache, and I thought, well, I'll try one. But

06:10.374 --> 06:12.877
other than that, I mean, I didn't have a beard or 
anything. And your hair was what length? Oh, I

06:15.640 --> 06:19.444
would say it would reach my shoulders. It wasn't 
long. I mean, it wasn't something that I could. But

06:23.529 --> 06:25.951
it was very, very manageable. I mean, nowadays, it 
would be considered Relatively mild. The first

06:31.041 --> 06:35.485
year or two, what did you and your buddies do on a 
Saturday night to have fun? Where did y'all go

06:36.426 --> 06:37.407
play? Well, I guess we'd go to the movies downtown. 
We'd go bowling,

06:43.974 --> 06:49.160
get some pizza. Of course, we'd go to football 
games. uh there was always a there was always those

06:52.321 --> 07:20.337
concerts before the football games that we went to 
uh

06:52.321 --> 07:20.337
i can't say there was much much more to do uh did did 
uh was was it normal for you and your buddies to go

06:52.321 --> 07:20.337
have beer somewhere no because well because we i 
didn't drink and and the friends that we hung

06:52.321 --> 07:20.337
around with were basically non-drinkers also so 
That never really was one of those traditions or

07:21.008 --> 07:27.957
activities we engaged in. It was really kind of... 
If you needed advice that first year, to whom did

07:30.180 --> 07:34.165
you turn other than a brother? Was there anybody on 
campus that you turned to about what courses to

07:34.926 --> 07:42.916
take? No, not that first year. Later, there was a 
couple of people. Who would it be then, later?

07:50.017 --> 07:55.065
Wayne Stark was probably one of the... How did you 
meet him? Well, my sophomore, second semester of

07:55.686 --> 08:09.207
my sophomore year, a friend of mine who was a 
graduate student, we started talking about

07:55.686 --> 08:09.207
establishing a group. on campus and Hispanic 
group and Wayne Stark had worked with a lot of the

08:09.524 --> 08:26.966
MSC groups so we went to visit him and he was very, 
very supportive, very inspirational about

08:09.524 --> 08:26.966
achievement. He had worked with Henry Cisneros 
and Hector Gutierrez and a group of other students

08:27.027 --> 08:37.540
that he had sort of mentored and worked with and And 
that's why he was a guy that could make you feel

08:38.633 --> 08:46.221
like, wow, I can accomplish something. And so I was 
very appreciative of Mr. Wayne Stark because he

08:46.241 --> 09:00.937
had this enthusiasm for making students feel good 
about themselves and really asking good

08:46.241 --> 09:00.937
questions about why and what do you mean by that. 
And I mean, not to challenge one, but to make you

09:01.017 --> 09:06.143
think critically. Now, you mentioned Hector and

09:06.646 --> 09:13.956
Henry. They were already gone. They had to 
graduate, hadn't they? Right. They were a few

09:16.540 --> 09:18.563
years ahead. But I was aware of them through, I 
can't remember how, I guess just some different

09:19.224 --> 09:28.017
dialogue we had had. And I met them later. I mean, 
when I was in college, I had met them. Did you all

09:32.503 --> 09:33.885
organize a group? Yes, a group of us did, and in fact 
it's called the Committee on the Awareness of the

09:34.895 --> 09:40.901
Mexican-American Culture. What's that? It's 
CAMAC, the Committee on the Awareness of the

09:42.082 --> 09:46.007
Mexican-American Culture. One of the things that 
my buddies and I began to see, and these were

09:46.467 --> 10:03.805
students that were in the core, non-core, 
graduate students and undergrads, one of the

09:46.467 --> 10:03.805
things that we noticed was that we felt that the 
reason why other students felt somewhat

10:05.354 --> 10:09.178
they saw it differently was because they didn't 
understand the culture. And so we thought why not

10:10.440 --> 10:22.855
let's form a group that talks about the Hispanic 
culture, the mixed American culture, what it is,

10:10.440 --> 10:22.855
what it's not, and help in that vein. And the MSC 
became the sponsor group for that and so that's

10:22.875 --> 10:29.202
where I started getting involved with that 
activity. All right. Now let's cover the whole

10:34.375 --> 10:38.619
four years from here on. Generalize about the 
Hispanic student body here. Where were they from?

10:45.566 --> 10:49.070
What was their background and so forth at A&M in 
those years? I think a lot of them came from San

10:49.531 --> 10:52.454
Antonio in the Valley. There's a good number from 
Houston. Laredo had always a large number. The

10:57.819 --> 10:58.800
Laredo hometown club, there was always a strong 
group. And they were mainly boys, because the

11:02.686 --> 11:12.680
girls were beginning to barely start coming in, 
but it wasn't really a stronghold there. I

11:13.100 --> 11:18.547
graduated in December of 73, so the girls hadn't 
really started coming in. The students came from

11:18.607 --> 11:25.817
families that were probably middle income or 
better. Were they first-generation college

11:26.540 --> 11:31.973
students or some of them second? I would say a lot of 
them were second generation because their

11:31.993 --> 11:37.647
parents had gone to school somewhere else. I heard 
later, which I thought made sense, from Laredo, a

11:37.667 --> 11:44.042
lot of the... the Aggie mothers there had gone, 
there's kids that had gone to Laredo Community

11:44.630 --> 12:02.057
College, and once they got out, they sent their 
kids, and the mothers of these kids, they had gone

11:44.630 --> 12:02.057
to UT or had gone to some other school, but they sent 
their kids to A&M. And I don't know what that

12:02.758 --> 12:06.925
connection was from the very beginning, but... A 
lot of Mexican-American kids, but there were also

12:07.445 --> 12:13.051
some of the kids who were very modest means. I mean, 
one of my best friends, Steven Salinas, who's an

12:13.151 --> 12:23.461
engineer, finished with a chemical engineering 
degree with a 4.0, and his brother finished here

12:13.151 --> 12:23.461
and went on to UT Medical Center. Both came from a 
home in West Laco, one-room house, and her mother

12:24.802 --> 12:34.252
was a nurse's aide, and they worked. I mean, they 
were just poor. Now, did you all create Khamak

12:36.402 --> 12:43.575
because you wanted to keep people from harassing 
you? Were you all being bothered? No, no. It wasn't

12:47.201 --> 12:51.789
harassment because it was never that physical. 
That's what I thought. But it was more of a sense of

12:53.171 --> 12:57.499
connectivity. In other words, a lot of this was 
driven by what a lot of the other kids were feeling

12:58.019 --> 13:09.582
from Laredo and from the Valley, because for them, 
coming to this environment was really, really

12:58.019 --> 13:09.582
tough. I was used to this environment. To me, it was 
not such an environment that I was not used to.

13:15.655 --> 13:19.723
Being the only Hispanic in an all-white setting, 
that was not unusual. But this is a very

13:19.703 --> 13:26.074
interesting time, I guess, the career, the life of 
this state. In the late 60s, the Chicano, the

13:26.936 --> 13:32.606
so-called Hispanic Chicano movement was getting 
started. So you would begin to hear and see

13:33.247 --> 13:37.695
literature that talked about this movement. 
Well, being 18, 19 years old, it was the kind of

13:38.080 --> 13:41.925
stuff that, okay, what is that all about? So it 
awakened a lot of ideas about culture, language,

13:42.666 --> 13:46.772
history. Well, where is our history? Where is our 
background? Where do you see that? So it began to

13:50.998 --> 13:52.580
raise a lot of those questions. So it was one of 
those, the timing of it was just right. Had it

13:56.626 --> 13:59.650
happened five years before, that wouldn't have 
been the case. But it was a question of what was

14:00.592 --> 14:06.400
going on in a larger external part of this country. 
of this state that impacted us. Were there some key

14:09.205 --> 14:17.476
professional staff and or faculty other than 
Wayne Stark that were positive in helping you all?

14:18.698 --> 14:24.065
Yeah, I think Chuck McCandless was one of them. He 
began to see the effort. Billy Lay Director of

14:29.853 --> 14:31.615
Admissions at that time. We had worked with him 
because we were trying to recruit students. I

14:35.520 --> 14:42.748
mean, we wanted to see how could we help create a 
positive feeling for Hispanic students. How

14:43.449 --> 14:44.930
could we help recruit students? So we kind of on our 
own took that as an opportunity. We found

14:49.836 --> 14:54.702
ourselves to be somewhat privileged to be able to 
achieve what we were achieving going to college.

14:55.442 --> 14:57.765
And we wanted to see how do we bring more students 
in. I mean, it's... It's some of the same thing

14:59.873 --> 15:02.837
that's happening now. But I haven't heard you 
infer in any way that this was intended to be some

15:03.458 --> 15:09.286
kind of protest. Oh, no. No, no. By no means. 
Because, I mean, I think we saw the A&M family being

15:11.969 --> 15:20.420
big enough to welcome people who were very 
different. And by the way, at the same time,

15:20.441 --> 15:28.311
Hispanics and African-Americans, we sort of 
connected because there were very few

15:20.441 --> 15:28.311
African-American students on campus and most of 
them were athletes so there was a there was a

15:29.033 --> 15:38.082
connectivity there and they felt alienated they 
felt somewhat ostracized not that anybody would

15:38.838 --> 15:41.803
intentionally do something and say, get out of 
here, whatever. It was just, there was not a social

15:42.364 --> 15:46.592
connection with a lot of the students. All right. 
In terms of vocabulary, in that era, normally,

15:47.734 --> 15:59.715
what did you and your associates, what wording did 
you all use to identify yourselves? As far as

16:00.590 --> 16:01.653
Latinos? Yeah. You weren't Chicano. Well, no, 
there were Chicanos. Did you use that word very

16:05.602 --> 16:06.985
often? Yes, a lot of the students did. What was the 
preferable term? I think the word... Chicano,

16:17.380 --> 16:21.144
Mexican-American, it depended on what part of the 
state you were from. No, I'm talking about here.

16:23.286 --> 16:34.017
What I'm saying, when people came to school here 
from other parts of the state, some came and they

16:23.286 --> 16:34.017
would say, don't ever call me Chicano because my 
parents, they don't like that word, particularly

16:23.286 --> 16:34.017
people from the Valley. Others, it was not such a 
bad deal. In San Antonio, it was not such a bad deal.

16:38.282 --> 16:42.426
It all depended on who was... who it was and where 
they were from. What was the most widely accepted

16:45.494 --> 16:47.496
term? I said Chicano was, because part of it was, 
again, there were groups that were getting

16:47.636 --> 16:55.223
started that were using the word Chicano. The word 
Chicano has always been part of our language, but

16:55.243 --> 17:00.828
it was used mainly among the groups. Here was, 
okay, let's surface this group as a word that

17:01.608 --> 17:13.459
describes us as a group versus what the government 
has decided to call us, Mexican-American or

17:13.827 --> 17:14.167
Whatever. So it was more or less, we decided who we 
are and we're going to use this term because it best

17:14.328 --> 17:20.076
describes us. And in makeup, almost every single 
person in your group was Mexican-American, not

17:21.077 --> 17:31.411
from any other Latin background. No, it was being 
Mexican-American. And almost no Mexican

17:33.053 --> 17:35.637
nationals. No, because most of those would have 
been probably more associated with the

17:39.157 --> 17:42.442
international students. Let's see, did I cut off a 
while ago, you said Chuck McCandless. Were there

17:47.589 --> 17:52.536
any other staff or faculty that were very helpful 
to y'all during this time?

17:55.620 --> 17:57.022
Billy Lay, like I said. I think those were pretty 
much some of the

17:57.042 --> 18:07.597
ones that struck out the most. Did you have a 
sponsor? Did you have to have an advisor? Yes, and I

18:11.592 --> 18:16.581
don't remember who that was when it first started. 
I don't remember who that was exactly.

18:22.592 --> 18:28.823
Now, I'm assuming that in terms of religious 
affiliation, you would have been an exception as a

18:22.592 --> 18:28.823
Methodist. Yes, yes, because everybody else 
among the Hispanics were all Catholic. That's

18:33.160 --> 18:34.361
what I would have... But there were some good 
number of Baptist students who came. Oh, really?

18:38.946 --> 18:39.026
Yes. Okay. So there was a, in fact, my mother, at our 
home, every Sunday we would have, ever since my

18:39.627 --> 18:58.067
brothers were in college and even when I went, we 
would invite friends of ours to come eat lunch with

18:39.627 --> 18:58.067
us at my dad's house, at our house. And my mother 
would make caldo de res, you know, broth of beef,

18:58.570 --> 19:07.999
and some mole, chicken mole. And that was sort of 
our treat. And we would have maybe anywhere from

19:10.081 --> 19:23.093
five to ten college students that would come over 
and have, I've had guys that they were five, six,

19:10.081 --> 19:23.093
eight years old and say, oh, I remember, I know who 
you are. I used to go to your house with your

19:23.994 --> 19:25.776
brothers all the time. So I mean, I've had that 
happen to me even a couple of years ago. Let's see,

19:32.927 --> 19:42.638
back in student life, did you and your buddies get 
involved as undergraduates in any kind of good

19:32.927 --> 19:42.638
bull, any pranks, any jokes? Well, no. It was 
really difficult to do given the time that we had,

19:48.044 --> 19:55.712
limited time. I wouldn't want to say that I was all 
serious and no play, but

19:56.080 --> 20:09.319
you have to understand, my parents had reared us 
pretty conservatively. And so doing some pranks

20:09.980 --> 20:14.146
was pretty much not one of those things we did. I

20:15.367 --> 20:19.253
really can't remember. In terms of going to class, 
what were your rules about going to class and what

20:19.992 --> 20:30.664
kind of behavior did you try to follow in a class? I 
tried to attend every class. I was very, as much as

20:34.668 --> 20:36.611
possible. I guess my classes that I began to really 
enjoy a lot were my sociology and philosophy

20:45.423 --> 20:50.289
classes. Doctor, he was a biologist.

20:58.100 --> 21:11.818
He taught a social biology course, older 
gentleman, and he opened my eyes to a lot of

20:58.100 --> 21:11.818
discussions about the effects of ecology, the 
effects of sociology and biology. So those

21:12.254 --> 21:16.181
classes were, Gary Holter was one of my 
professors.

21:19.186 --> 21:26.097
They opened my eyes a lot to the whole notion of who I 
was, who we were as a society. And again,

21:26.658 --> 21:31.446
politically speaking, things were changing in 
the state in 69 to 73. I mean, there was a lot of

21:31.466 --> 21:36.034
Hispanic groups Rising there was a lot of issues 
about race issues Ethnic issues across the

21:36.402 --> 21:41.710
country. So those were just really timely

21:41.730 --> 22:05.346
We're talking about key people and you said Gary 
Halter Dr. Van Riper who at the time when I started

21:41.730 --> 22:05.346
and I remember him as a department head in 
political science he later on served as a

21:41.730 --> 22:05.346
reference for me to law school and So obviously he 
was quite... Did you have any courses with him?

22:10.321 --> 22:15.167
Yes, I took a graduate course with him in personnel 
management. I took 12 hours in grad school, though

22:16.008 --> 22:25.601
my heart was not in it because of circumstances 
that had changed for me.

22:29.106 --> 22:33.612
When I finished college, I got admitted to St. 
Mary's Law School. but because I didn't plan well

22:34.638 --> 22:54.825
enough, I was in love, my mind was a little 
confused, I decided to hold back and but as good

22:34.638 --> 22:54.825
fortune happens I was offered a job as assistant 
director of admissions involving recruitment of

22:34.638 --> 22:54.825
students. So all those things being what they were 
I thought you know I'll put off law school for a

23:00.372 --> 23:02.675
while. It bothered me a lot, and of course later on I 
did, eight years later I did go to law school, seven

23:03.276 --> 23:12.006
years later, but that happened. All right, and as 
you progressed through A&M, was there someone

23:13.348 --> 23:23.680
that became your advisor that you went to for 
advice and counsel?

23:26.564 --> 23:28.506
There was a gentleman by the name of,

23:34.983 --> 23:40.269
My brain is just going out on me here. He was a 
political science professor who happened to be a

23:40.490 --> 23:43.794
lawyer. Jack Woods? Jack Woods. Describe him. 
Jack Woods was a professor. I guess he was an

23:53.265 --> 23:56.850
adjunct professor perhaps, but he was a lawyer. 
And he was the first lawyer professor that I really

24:01.747 --> 24:03.369
got to know and talk. I took constitutional law 
under him and judicial process under him. And he

24:08.857 --> 24:14.184
really, really excited me about the law and the 
class, the way he taught it. And he was a person that

24:15.386 --> 24:17.549
I could talk to. We talked a lot about school. A 
couple of times he invited me over to go to his

24:20.954 --> 24:24.439
house. In fact, he also served as a letter of 
reference for me. And I guess what it did, his

24:28.561 --> 24:43.515
relationship with me and my relationship to him, 
helped me with more ease and more comfort talk

24:28.561 --> 24:43.515
about what I wanted to do. It wasn't so much just a 
strictly uncomfortable discussion, but a very

24:44.204 --> 24:52.531
comfortable discussion about opportunities and 
challenges. And he also happened to be a very

24:52.571 --> 24:59.638
strong faith-based individual who didn't mind 
sharing that with me. All right. Now, was he or

25:00.439 --> 25:06.344
someone else the one who would help you pick out 
your courses your junior and senior year? No. I

25:08.846 --> 25:12.169
don't remember that there was anybody in 
particular. A lot of times it may have been the

25:13.027 --> 25:21.755
department secretary who knew about as much about 
what was offered and what was not offered. But I

25:22.316 --> 25:34.047
think it's a combination of faculty like Gary 
Halter and Jack Woods and Dr. Pawn and Riper who one

25:22.316 --> 25:34.047
began to kind of feel comfortable with. Looking 
back, were there any courses that you now realize

25:34.407 --> 25:38.551
were quite important to you? I think my course in 
philosophy. my course in social biology, and

25:43.587 --> 25:56.201
my sociology courses that I took. I mean, I think 
they helped me think about a lot about communities

25:56.241 --> 26:01.647
and society. And the courses I took with Jack Woods 
helped me think about what law school was going to

26:02.248 --> 26:08.835
be like.

26:10.081 --> 26:14.288
A&M-related experience that you now realize was 
life-changing to you?

26:17.653 --> 26:18.374
All right, thank you.

26:23.863 --> 26:26.908
Oh, let me see here, life-changing.

26:29.372 --> 26:32.737
No accidents, no sheer coincidences?

26:34.780 --> 26:37.084
No, I mean, it was a...

26:40.118 --> 26:42.101
I'm assuming you didn't flunk a course. No, I 
didn't. I didn't flunk a course.

26:51.072 --> 26:52.074
I had a... I guess when I was a sophomore, I had a real 
eye-opener in my own personal life. I had... And it

26:58.482 --> 27:09.737
really, for about six months to a year, I... I had a 
failed relationship with this young lady, and it

27:10.510 --> 27:17.856
really just shook me up in terms of what I wanted to 
do with my career and my work and my life. And it

27:18.737 --> 27:25.883
really just shook me up because I had to really get a 
hold of my roots to say, what am I going to do? And as

27:25.923 --> 27:34.190
good fortune would have, I went to work in Chicago 
with the United Methodist Church as a missionary,

27:25.923 --> 27:34.190
urban missionary. And that really transformed my 
thinking about myself. And when I came back to

27:37.993 --> 27:40.315
school, my junior year it really just uh... was 
dedicated and actually my grades started getting

27:41.206 --> 27:52.797
better and made the dean's list about two or three 
times and uh... you know really get myself back.

27:52.937 --> 27:53.878
How long were you up there? First summer. First 
summer. What I would do in the summers is that I

27:56.461 --> 28:00.665
would work as a youth director in various 
churches. I did that for three different uh...

28:00.725 --> 28:03.908
four different communities. Now one of my normal 
questions is about uh... religious groups on the

28:08.510 --> 28:10.092
campus. Your primary activity that was related to 
religion was at the United Methodist Church in

28:10.872 --> 28:18.940
Bryan, is that right? It was Oak Grove United 
Methodist Church. It was a church my father

28:21.102 --> 28:22.724
founded. And where, what part of town is it? It's in 
West Bryan, off of 21 and 6, and it's a Hispanic

28:25.447 --> 28:31.973
United Methodist Church. How big was it then? Oh, 
probably about 150 members. And so that's where

28:37.751 --> 28:40.694
you attended. I attended there on Sundays, but I 
also, during the week, the Baptist Student Union

28:41.374 --> 28:55.430
had a great lunch on certain days and a great 
speaker. And so my brother and a couple of my

28:56.811 --> 29:00.555
buddies, we would all, would come and eat at the 
BSU. That was more towards my junior or senior

29:05.947 --> 29:10.673
year, and it was great. Now, did anybody ever tease 
you about a group of Methodists coming over to eat

29:11.915 --> 29:17.202
Baptist food or anything like that? No, I think it 
was intended that everybody would. I think

29:19.646 --> 29:23.772
everybody, even from the Wesley Foundation, went 
over there. I mean, the Wesley Foundation had

29:23.792 --> 29:26.896
their own, but it was not comparable. It was just a 
great place. program they had there. As far as you

29:31.209 --> 29:38.337
can recall, describe the religious groups and 
their activities on the campus in those days.

29:40.039 --> 29:52.733
Well, the most I can remember, of course, I 
remember going to the All-Face Chapel a few times

29:40.039 --> 29:52.733
for some weddings, and

29:53.624 --> 30:03.278
I guess the strongest group that I remember were 
the Baptists, because they had the Baptist Union,

29:53.624 --> 30:03.278
and they would have ongoing activities, and 
sometimes you'd see stuff where they were

29:53.624 --> 30:03.278
inviting people to come. But I don't recall any 
particular... What about St. Mary's? No. It was

30:09.428 --> 30:14.455
there, but I really didn't... It's right close to 
the Wesley Foundation, but I never really was

30:14.495 --> 30:22.467
connected to that because just not being Catholic 
and... Strange enough, most of my friends were

30:23.020 --> 30:27.745
Protestants. They were Baptist or Methodist or 
other Protestants. And Religious Emphasis Week

30:31.330 --> 30:35.094
was long gone from A&M by then, wasn't it? Yeah, I 
think so. I mean, I don't remember that being

30:36.015 --> 30:37.997
celebrated. That's what I thought. It may have 
been, but I don't remember it. Did you encounter

30:41.241 --> 30:48.910
many A&M students who were of some other religious 
background other than Christianity? A few Jews,

30:50.206 --> 30:52.549
but not very many. How were they treated? Same. I 
mean, it was no... I don't think that the Jews,

30:56.976 --> 31:07.631
either in high school or in college, I don't 
remember ever having

30:56.976 --> 31:07.631
any particular... I mean, I guess if we had a 
stereotype about them, is that they were... You

31:07.651 --> 31:12.879
know, they had a different way of... They didn't 
believe in Jesus as a Savior, but they were... I

31:16.885 --> 31:18.627
mean, for the most part, I think... The Jews that I 
encountered in high school here, the Polykovs

31:19.298 --> 31:23.925
were two brothers that were...
