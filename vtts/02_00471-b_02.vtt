00:01.212 --> 00:07.858
I like to be selfish and say that I could never have 
learned this anywhere but Texas A&M.

00:09.200 --> 00:26.316
Certainly that's not correct, but I think a person 
can get out of nearly anything that you do, say, or

00:09.200 --> 00:26.316
associate with about what you want to get out of it. 
I would like to think that I could have gone to most

00:29.613 --> 00:36.821
any school that offered the things that the Texas 
A&M did and gotten a basic background.

00:39.664 --> 00:51.818
Here again, I'm not sure that I would have been as 
pleased with it as I was with A&M because I had an

00:39.664 --> 00:51.818
ingrained love for A&M. I had been associated, 
lived near here, but I'm just not sure that all the

00:52.019 --> 00:59.367
things that that I got there that I could have 
gotten just anywhere across the board.

01:07.394 --> 01:08.215
I'm an Aggie at heart. I just don't believe there's 
any place like it. But here again, there are many

01:12.179 --> 01:19.246
fine places, and I've got to be. Anything else that 
we missed that we should talk about? No, I don't

01:23.871 --> 01:29.337
know of anything that we've missed, but I would 
like to just...

01:32.438 --> 02:01.483
have pass a word to the succeeding people that come 
along and particularly I guess young military

01:32.438 --> 02:01.483
students and that is that

01:32.438 --> 02:01.483
many people that have gone on before us have as the 
saying goes have fought bled and died that that we

01:32.438 --> 02:01.483
could have what we've got and I think that I could 
say to these young fellows, the way that you and I

02:01.784 --> 02:15.605
can pay our debt to the past is make the future 
indebted to us. And I think so many times that

02:17.147 --> 02:25.981
people say, oh, you know, there's nothing worth 
working for anymore. There's nothing worth

02:26.021 --> 02:28.044
fighting for anymore. And that's not right. I 
think we all have got a responsibility to take care

02:31.771 --> 02:42.683
of, and if we take care of it like the head of us did, 
we'll continue to be great. And I have the greatest

02:44.105 --> 02:59.922
admiration for a bunch of young ROTC students that 
have chosen to take military training, and

02:44.105 --> 02:59.922
particularly now when it's in in a few years past 
that was so unpopular yeah and i think uh i think

03:01.066 --> 03:30.769
that's a that's a feather in their head and i think 
that kind of person is going to be a good leader and i

03:01.066 --> 03:30.769
think they they'll say into the rest of the world 
you know this is this is important and regardless

03:01.066 --> 03:30.769
what you think about it i'm going to do it and i have 
an admiration for those people and i also think

03:01.066 --> 03:30.769
that that the fact that it's voluntary is a feather 
in their hat. And I also think that another thing

03:40.804 --> 03:46.269
that's made A&M great is the Corps of Cadets. That 
has really been a stabilizing influence on that

03:47.250 --> 03:53.256
university over the years. They've had some 
turmoils. They've had some unrests and some

03:55.518 --> 04:02.224
demonstrations of tempted and I think the Coral 
Cadets is to a great degree responsible for

04:03.115 --> 04:20.637
holding the boat steady and staying firm and 
staying strong and you know speaking out, showing

04:03.115 --> 04:20.637
up where they need to be, wearing the uniform. I 
think that's another one of the reasons an Aggie is

04:22.900 --> 04:30.169
respected where he goes and he's like he's looked 
up to. And I think the fact that A&M University has

04:33.873 --> 04:49.687
provided more officers for the defense of this 
country than any other place, including West

04:33.873 --> 04:49.687
Point, is also another tribute to these fellows 
who have got all this ahead of them. I think this is

04:49.707 --> 04:53.990
something for them to strive to keep up. So I just 
say to them, you know, Well, keep going. Keep at it.

05:05.682 --> 05:11.751
You've heard that saying about not asking a man if 
he's an Aggie, haven't you? You know, you're not

05:13.153 --> 05:15.556
supposed to ask a man if he's an Aggie. They say that 
you should not ask a fella if he's an Aggie, because

05:17.579 --> 05:28.375
if he isn't, she don't want to embarrass him, and if 
he is, he'll tell you soon enough. Yeah, right.

05:30.207 --> 05:35.294
That's

05:30.207 --> 05:35.294
not much of a note to end this thing on. Well, this is 
a nice thought that you had about the Corps, and

05:35.494 --> 05:44.586
that's an excellent way, I think, on ending this 
very enjoyable interview that we've had. Thank

05:45.067 --> 05:46.729
you very much, General Hanover. I certainly 
appreciate it. Well, I would say this to you,

05:48.792 --> 05:51.175
Terry. I think it's a great undertaking that you 
have gotten into, and Here again, this is

05:57.697 --> 06:00.019
voluntary. Nobody told you to. And I think it will 
pay tribute to some of us who have been more

06:02.442 --> 06:12.852
successful than others, whatever the reason. And 
if the things that we have said or the ideas that

06:12.872 --> 06:27.366
we've portrayed can be of any significant use to 
anybody, I think your undertaking is certainly

06:27.903 --> 06:28.464
pay off. I know that you and this young lady are 
going to work on it or are going to put a lot of effort

06:30.226 --> 06:37.836
into it even though that's your job. It's still a 
it's still a thing that I would hope a lot of people

06:38.196 --> 06:49.110
could have a lot of enjoyment out of and maybe get 
some ideas and I thank you. Well thanks to the

06:49.390 --> 06:51.153
former students too. Well that's right. Support 
on us that was a great move on their part. Thank you.
