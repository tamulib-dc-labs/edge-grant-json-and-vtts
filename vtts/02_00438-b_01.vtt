WEBVTT

00:04.402 --> 00:10.351
I think it was about 15,000 people pulled out of 
there that day. And we did not have a single

00:10.371 --> 00:18.583
accident other than the one I described in doing 
that. And this was accomplished, if my memory

00:19.144 --> 00:32.383
serves me correctly, with one heavy helicopter 
squadron of CH-52s, two

00:33.443 --> 00:42.096
H-34 squadrons and we had a Huey squadron which was 
really used in reserve. So there was a small number

00:43.058 --> 00:49.768
of Marine helicopter pilots.

00:52.832 --> 01:01.105
Earned their pay.

01:05.152 --> 01:08.797
And my hat's off to them. They did a tremendous job. 
And, of course, the Marines that went into the

01:11.000 --> 01:16.529
embassy there did a tremendous job. They did not 
have a single solitary casualty, nor did they kill

01:16.549 --> 01:22.457
anybody.

01:25.261 --> 01:31.711
They were able to do this and get out of there 
without any problem. So I'm proud of them.

01:34.480 --> 01:42.729
Emotionally, what did you think about the 
evacuation and the war was coming to an end and

01:34.480 --> 01:42.729
you're evacuating everybody out? Well, I

01:42.749 --> 02:04.251
hated to see us desert the Vietnamese Army

01:42.749 --> 02:04.251
because I had seen what communism would do. I saw, 
for instance, what the North Vietnamese did in Hue

02:08.184 --> 02:19.615
Phu Bai during the Tet Offensive. All of the 
Vietnamese that were working with us then, I

02:19.635 --> 02:27.402
shouldn't say all, but many of them were killed. 
They had their hands cut off. There were all kinds

02:29.463 --> 02:33.327
of atrocities that were committed by the North 
Vietnamese and the Viet Cong during the Tet

02:34.184 --> 02:41.211
Offensive. Well, there was no reason to believe 
that anything less than that was going to occur

02:42.792 --> 02:50.660
when the North Vietnamese took over.

02:53.522 --> 03:03.752
So yes, I had great sympathy for the people in the 
South Vietnamese Army and The civilians, of

03:04.289 --> 03:11.999
course, that had been a part of our effort there, I 
knew that they were going to be mistreated badly.

03:17.106 --> 03:19.549
But you can't really dwell on things like that. 
Your orders are to do a certain thing, so you do it.

03:25.156 --> 03:33.267
And you just have to have faith that your 
government or something is going to try to do the

03:33.517 --> 03:35.880
best they can in other areas. And it was a sad day. 
There's no doubt about that.

03:43.651 --> 03:45.173
What were your feelings about the Vietnamese? 
Well, the Vietnamese are good people.

03:51.682 --> 04:02.697
The Oriental

03:51.682 --> 04:02.697
is not well understood by most Americans, and I 
don't claim to be an expert on that, but I have

03:51.682 --> 04:02.697
better understanding, I guess, than the average 
person. But he's a hardworking person. He wants to

04:09.138 --> 04:13.123
be free as much as you and I do.

04:19.050 --> 04:32.987
But I think because they are basically a peaceable 
people who work hard, then they're

04:19.050 --> 04:32.987
more apt to be taken over by a group such as the 
communists. Because really all they want to do is

04:40.438 --> 04:42.881
work and be left alone. So communism can come in 
with a few people and get organized and so forth and

04:43.802 --> 04:48.928
get control. And that basically is what happened. 
Now, there were crooks within the Vietnamese

04:53.314 --> 04:59.481
government.

05:03.258 --> 05:04.620
There's crooks in any government. There's, you 
know, graft. There's greedy people. There's

05:07.423 --> 05:12.330
people who see an opportunity to make a windfall. 
And they did that. But there was no more in the

05:13.571 --> 05:19.338
Vietnamese society than what there is ours. 
They're basically good people. And I would like to

05:22.542 --> 05:26.928
see that land be free one day.

05:31.073 --> 05:32.455
I don't foresee that. in the near future, but I 
would certainly like to see it. How'd you feel

05:39.059 --> 05:42.865
about Army? Well, they had the same problem that I 
alluded to that our Army had. See, they started out

05:54.001 --> 05:58.908
with nothing in 1964. Basically

05:58.968 --> 06:02.914
nothing. that actually had started before that. 
But the size of the Army prior to 64 was next to

06:07.598 --> 06:14.127
nothing. They started drafting people, putting 
them in uniform, putting them in organizations,

06:16.110 --> 06:33.475
assigning people to command them that didn't know 
anything whatsoever about military, and giving

06:16.110 --> 06:33.475
them a ill-defined job and mission And then why 
should anybody be surprised that they performed

06:35.210 --> 06:42.901
in a very poor manner? We started giving them 
advisors and so forth. And again, General

06:50.052 --> 06:57.122
Schwarzkopf alluded to this in his book. When they 
had good commanders, they had good units. When

07:02.530 --> 07:04.052
they had bad commanders, They had bad units. If you 
had a battalion commander that did not know what to

07:06.841 --> 07:15.354
do or how to do it, what can you expect of him? And so 
being as they started from nothing and mobilized

07:16.756 --> 07:32.179
to a rather large force for them, you have to assume 
that a lot of the commanders were politically

07:16.756 --> 07:32.179
appointed. It's that simple. And you know, you 
take a person who's inept, and today he's a

07:34.728 --> 07:52.670
civilian, tomorrow he's a major commanding an 
ARVN battalion, he's still inept.

07:52.690 --> 08:02.642
If he's lucky, he would get a good advisor and would 
be smart enough to listen to him.

08:03.398 --> 08:14.574
If he didn't get all of his people killed in the 
meantime, he would eventually develop into a

08:03.398 --> 08:14.574
reasonable unit. But you compare them to a Marine 
battalion, for instance, and there would be no

08:14.594 --> 08:24.148
comparison. They didn't know how to use 
supporting arms, for instance. And of course,

08:29.515 --> 08:31.498
their artillerymen were equally ill-prepared.

08:38.573 --> 08:43.379
So for a long time, they could call for artillery 
support. And because it had to go through so many

08:45.241 --> 08:57.738
layers to get approval to include civilians, that 
by the time they'd get a fire mission approved,

08:45.241 --> 08:57.738
there wouldn't be any point to fire it. The enemy's 
gone. So they worked under some terrible

09:01.280 --> 09:06.847
restrictions that we did not work under.

09:10.151 --> 09:17.360
So I think before we judged them too severely, all 
those things had to be taken into consideration.

09:18.401 --> 09:26.972
They worked under conditions that made it almost 
impossible most of the time for them to succeed.

09:26.992 --> 09:31.017
How did your views change on the Vietnamese during 
the course of the war?

09:36.532 --> 09:39.635
Well, I don't know as it did. I could recognize from 
the outset that they were... Now, when you say

09:39.655 --> 09:51.607
Vietnamese, do you mean the army or the... The 
South Vietnamese, just the people. The people. I

09:55.631 --> 09:56.812
don't know as it changed. I respected them. 
They're different people. Their religion is

10:01.757 --> 10:03.579
different. Their culture is different. I did not 
understand much of their culture and most of their

10:05.928 --> 10:11.716
religion. And I'm sure they didn't understand 
mine. But they're good people and all they wanted

10:15.080 --> 10:23.431
was to be left alone to live. That's all they 
wanted. The communists wouldn't do it and there

10:26.975 --> 10:34.365
were times I'm sure when they thought we were kind 
of being strong armed in our support of them.

10:39.558 --> 10:52.634
But you have to realize, when you're the 800-pound 
gorilla, and that's what we were,

10:39.558 --> 10:52.634
you go into an area, you do a lot of damage.

10:55.717 --> 10:57.780
We tore roads up. We tore cemeteries up. Not 
intentionally. But you move a large force

11:03.117 --> 11:14.952
through, you move tanks through, the

11:03.117 --> 11:14.952
terrain was such that it just wasn't built for 
armies like we were. I'm sure they got mad at us. I'm

11:19.118 --> 11:31.133
sure there's times when I would get a little upset 
with them when I couldn't understand, here I am

11:19.118 --> 11:31.133
over here trying to save your country and you're 
concerned about Me knocking this fence down to

11:32.480 --> 11:38.087
your house or something. You can't take a tank 
that's eight foot wide through a road that's six

11:39.408 --> 11:46.257
foot wide without tearing something up. If you 
believe that you've got to get through there, then

11:49.060 --> 11:53.005
you're going to go through there. But

11:55.448 --> 12:01.055
my view of the Vietnamese people didn't change. 
They're good people. They were in a terrible

12:02.956 --> 12:04.598
situation. Most of us are good people. We were in a 
terrible situation. We were trying to make the

12:10.567 --> 12:13.170
best of them. A bad situation. See, in almost every 
other war that we've ever fought, the

12:14.432 --> 12:24.246
non-combatants got out of the way and let the 
combatants fight. But they didn't do that in this

12:25.768 --> 12:27.130
war.

12:31.536 --> 12:31.596
Uh, When, for instance, when my unit had 
responsibility for the highway, we would often,

12:32.791 --> 13:02.393
not often, every night, we would go out with ambush 
patrols, which would, in many cases, be 200 yards

12:32.791 --> 13:02.393
outside of a village where 300 or 400 people were 
living and sleeping that night. Or we might go out,

13:03.487 --> 13:16.080
as we often did, and set up an ambush patrol in one of 
their cemeteries and wait for a Viet Cong patrol to

13:03.487 --> 13:16.080
come through. Because that's the way the terrain 
and so forth was.

13:24.789 --> 13:30.895
And I'm sure they were upset with us, and I'm sure 
there were times when I was upset with them.

13:34.705 --> 13:39.430
How did your views about the South Vietnamese Army 
change over the course of the war? Well, I think in

13:41.752 --> 13:54.064
many cases the poor commanders were weeded out and 
better commanders evolved. So they actually

13:55.265 --> 14:03.953
became a more

13:55.265 --> 14:03.953
effective combat force. But I found it strange, 
for instance, that they furnished liaison

14:06.245 --> 14:15.335
officers to us. That about once a month, my liaison 
officer would want to go home for three or four days

14:15.355 --> 14:23.524
while the war was going on. Look at it from his 
standpoint. Lord, this war had been going on for

14:25.607 --> 14:34.176
seven or eight years then and might very well go on 
for another seven or eight years. And yes, he had a

14:34.915 --> 14:42.522
family maybe 60 to 100 kilometers off. Why 
wouldn't he want to go?

14:49.589 --> 14:56.495
All things considered, I think they

14:49.589 --> 14:56.495
did pretty well. One of the factors that's often 
lost when people start trying to judge and put a

15:04.430 --> 15:17.566
handle on that is a conventional army fighting a 
guerrilla army is a mess at best.

15:22.192 --> 15:24.775
First of all, a conventional army usually is 
heavy. It's got lots of equipment, trucks,

15:25.096 --> 15:30.062
helicopters, guns, so forth. And when that's the 
case, then you're going to be pretty stationary. A

15:39.707 --> 15:42.350
guerrilla army can come and go as they please. They 
can just, you can see guerrillas one minute in an

15:42.470 --> 15:48.917
area. You can send people over there and they've 
evaporated. They've become part of the village.

16:00.089 --> 16:00.610
But that

16:03.425 --> 16:08.471
That regular army that's trying to fight him is 
always there. He's always visible.

16:13.557 --> 16:14.058
It's tough.

16:17.122 --> 16:31.339
And there have been very, very few occasions in 
history where a guerrilla army has not actually,

16:17.122 --> 16:31.339
in the end, come out on top.

16:34.829 --> 16:36.691
It's just the nature of the beast. It's tough.

16:43.797 --> 16:49.703
How were women treated from what you saw over 
there?

16:49.723 --> 16:52.005
Now, do you mean the Vietnamese women? Vietnamese 
women. Well, there again, this was a subject that

16:53.827 --> 17:03.756
was constantly talked about in my view. There was 
never any doubt in anybody's mind as to what I

17:05.879 --> 17:13.927
expected.

17:13.947 --> 17:33.287
The dumbest private in my battalion knew that if he 
mistreated or if he tried to rape or steal or

17:13.947 --> 17:33.287
anything like that, that I would lock his butt up so 
quick it would make his head swim.

17:33.307 --> 17:35.329
No ifs, ands, or buts about it. So as a result, we 
didn't have any trouble.

17:42.143 --> 17:53.577
First of all, when we were in the Waifu Bay area, we 
were so busy that it is just unreal. We were

17:54.258 --> 18:00.285
probably taking care of what at least three 
battalions should have had. And so my troops were

18:02.828 --> 18:06.733
so busy that when they were given an hour off, they 
slept. Because we were patrolling most of the day

18:13.032 --> 18:19.599
and all of the night. And so what little bit of time 
that they had off, they slept.

18:28.630 --> 18:34.797
But they also knew that there was not going to be any 
room for error. as it related to treating those

18:36.093 --> 18:39.858
people with dignity. And so they did. The

18:41.279 --> 18:50.570
truth matters, I don't recall ever having any 
problems reported to me. And believe me, we worked

18:51.051 --> 19:04.547
closely enough with the village chiefs and so 
forth, that if there was a problem, we had a

18:51.051 --> 19:04.547
technique of them getting the word to us quickly 
what was going on. But the key to it is this. My

19:08.908 --> 19:28.613
people knew because this sort of thing was 
discussed, I would say, at least three or four

19:08.908 --> 19:28.613
times a week in the battalion commander's 
conference where all of his staff and his company

19:08.908 --> 19:28.613
commanders were present. These sort of things 
were covered, and then it went downhill that we

19:30.335 --> 19:36.323
didn't have a problem. Now also, we had a system 
where when replacements came in, they were not

19:36.573 --> 19:58.345
sent down to the rifle companies until they had 
gone through an orientation program, part of

19:36.573 --> 19:58.345
which involved my telling them what would be done 
and what would not be done. So there was no doubt as

19:59.447 --> 20:06.377
to whether everybody had the word that this sort of 
stuff would not be tolerated that we would respect

20:07.589 --> 20:17.638
them as people, that we respect their religion and 
all of its symbols and so forth. So but I put that the

20:17.678 --> 20:35.554
leadership, you know, that's the reason for 
having off is so that the will of the commander is is

20:17.678 --> 20:35.554
transmitted right down to the lowest level and 
then You know, the last leadership technique is

20:36.209 --> 20:41.995
supervise. And the brand, the newest second 
lieutenant that I had knew that his primary job was

20:42.016 --> 20:51.766
to see that what I wanted done was done. And that I 
would nail his hide to the wall if it was not done.

21:01.818 --> 21:04.100
So you didn't tolerate any form of racism? None 
whatsoever. Did you allow to call the Vietnamese

21:07.360 --> 21:14.691
people by racial slurs or anything like that? 
Well, no. It was not officially allowed. But now,

21:17.836 --> 21:20.340
I'm not naive.

21:22.924 --> 21:27.350
That goes on today in our society. And you can keep a 
rein on it, but you cannot stop it. But as long as

21:37.921 --> 21:42.007
they know there's a rain on it, then it's not good. 
It'll never get you in trouble. But, yeah, there's

21:44.010 --> 21:45.892
some, I'm sure there is. How did we lose the war? We 
didn't lose the war. We lost the will to fight a war.

21:57.128 --> 21:57.929
And there's a difference.

22:01.114 --> 22:03.557
The will to fight the war was a political thing.

22:07.098 --> 22:10.563
The war is a military thing. Now, when we lost the 
will as a nation to do what was necessary from the

22:10.583 --> 22:27.986
military standpoint, then it was just a matter of 
time until inevitably it was going to crumble. But

22:28.006 --> 22:31.090
it's like taking bricks out of a wall. You can take 
so many bricks out in what used to be a formidable

22:37.861 --> 22:39.643
thing becomes a menace. It'll fall on you, will not 
protect you from anything after so many bricks

22:39.763 --> 22:47.091
have been taken out. And that is precisely what 
happened.

22:54.059 --> 22:55.040
Was the war a mistake? No. Why?

23:02.348 --> 23:07.294
Anything that is judged after the game is over is 
going to be judged very unfairly.

23:17.928 --> 23:23.494
President Eisenhower was the first one to get us 
involved in Vietnam. A lot of people don't realize

23:23.514 --> 23:24.895
that. Then came President John Kennedy who 
started to accelerate all this. In a perfect world

23:39.758 --> 23:52.068
a person in responsibility such as President 
Kennedy or so forth would have perfect

23:39.758 --> 23:52.068
information on which to base a decision to do 
something. And hence, whatever decision he made

23:54.070 --> 23:57.413
would probably be perfect. But that, well, there 
never has been such a situation and there never

23:59.615 --> 24:04.319
will be. But I don't recall really what the 
intelligence was. But I was on Okinawa in 1961.

24:18.108 --> 24:29.980
And I recall the intelligence briefings that we 
were getting then as it related to Laos, which was

24:18.108 --> 24:29.980
really more important than Vietnam at that time, 
and also then Vietnam. We followed it very

24:30.000 --> 24:31.261
closely. But some people say that military 
intelligence is an oxymoron. Well, that's not

24:40.542 --> 24:42.405
true, of course. But intelligence really starts 
out as just a lot of information.

24:52.058 --> 24:59.669
And again, it's usually provided by people that 
have a vested interest. Anytime you get

25:02.272 --> 25:09.402
information or advice from someone with a vested 
interest, you have a slanted interest. bit of

25:10.748 --> 25:13.452
information. And if you act on information that is 
less than perfect, then your action is going to be

25:13.472 --> 25:22.585
less than perfect. I truly believe with all my 
heart that President Kennedy, President Johnson

25:22.605 --> 25:34.242
was provided the best available information As to 
whether or not it was misinterpreted, either on

25:36.010 --> 25:41.955
the military level or on the political level, I 
don't know.

25:45.518 --> 25:57.028
I'm sure that they made decisions that they 
thought was best not only for this country as it

25:45.518 --> 25:57.028
relates to meeting our worldwide 
responsibility, but best for Vietnam. Some of

25:59.010 --> 26:01.372
them turned out not to be good decisions. But if 
there's any one thing that you learn Once a

26:05.575 --> 26:15.070
decision has been made on what you believe to be the 
best available information, go with it. If the

26:15.811 --> 26:18.476
information changes, then change. But a lot of 
these things can be equated to launching a bullet.

26:28.612 --> 26:32.578
Once that thing has been launched, it has a life of 
its own. And watch out down range. And sometimes

26:37.820 --> 26:40.384
that's about all you can do is say, look out.

26:43.529 --> 26:44.511
You may have been wrong. And the best you can do is 
say, look out. Here it comes. Drop that bomb. You

26:53.545 --> 26:58.714
truly believe it's on target when you drop that 
bomb. But it does not always hit its target. Now,

27:02.377 --> 27:08.764
are you going to go back and second guess yourself 
later on as to whether or not you should drop that

27:02.377 --> 27:08.764
bomb? If you do, you will lose your mind.

27:18.855 --> 27:26.704
People have talked about Vietnam saying that it's 
the war that we can't forget because we learn so

27:18.855 --> 27:26.704
much about ourselves. What kind of things did you 
learn about the human nature? I learned that

27:31.385 --> 27:40.133
people can be very mean to other people.

27:41.575 --> 27:59.552
I don't know what you've read on, and I keep 
referring to this My Lai Massacre, but here was a

27:41.575 --> 27:59.552
platoon of U.S. Army forces that went into a 
village men, women, and children of in a ditch and

28:00.427 --> 28:09.338
systematically shot them. Now that absolutely 
boggles my mind. So what did I learn? I learned that

28:15.906 --> 28:17.968
we can be a very cruel people. I know that that's not 
an isolated incident. That lesser things

28:22.293 --> 28:28.881
happened all over.

28:29.165 --> 28:40.822
My discussions with my contemporaries when I was 
on the Army staff

28:29.165 --> 28:40.822
showed me that, yes, that happened more often than 
we'd like to believe. But again, I put that on the

28:41.643 --> 28:44.407
leaders.

28:46.290 --> 28:57.687
His company commander and his battalion 
commander, I assigned equal responsibility with

28:46.290 --> 28:57.687
that of Lieutenant Kelly because If Cali had been 
properly led, he would have known that had he done

28:59.135 --> 29:12.355
something like that, that his company commander, 
his battalion commander, would have nailed his

28:59.135 --> 29:12.355
hide to the wall, he wouldn't have done it. But the 
potential for doing it is there. We are a mean

29:18.624 --> 29:23.411
people. The Vietnamese are mean people. They did 
the same thing to their people. They would go into

29:28.109 --> 29:36.740
villages that had been sympathetic to the 
vehicle. And they'd go in, and they would do this

29:36.760 --> 29:39.444
very same thing. They'd wipe them out. So we are 
mean people. I learned that. I learned also that we

29:46.212 --> 29:49.737
are very compassionate people. Most of us want to 
do good. There's good and bad within all of us. Most

29:54.824 --> 29:56.766
of the time, good wins. Sometimes bad wins.

30:01.496 --> 30:11.388
Some people allowed their pride and their ego to do 
things which were not in the best interest of

30:01.496 --> 30:11.388
either their units or the Vietnamese.

30:15.713 --> 30:17.135
The desire to succeed. They used to have what they 
called a body count, which in many units was a big

30:17.175 --> 30:23.643
deal. It wasn't with us. I can say that coming from 
above, I was never pressed for body count. In

30:33.473 --> 30:42.324
talking with my contemporaries that I knew in the 
Pentagon, it was a constant thing. So if it sounds

30:43.306 --> 30:48.312
as though I'm prejudiced, I guess I am. We were 
better led.

30:53.279 --> 30:54.040
Just that simple.

30:58.863 --> 31:03.810
How do you feel about the media coverage that went 
on during the war? I would assign, on a scale of 1 to

31:03.830 --> 31:12.241
10, I would assign the media coverage as a minus 10.

31:17.809 --> 31:21.554
There obviously are good people in the media. But 
for every good person, there were 10 who were

31:27.719 --> 31:41.069
looking for one thing and one thing only, 
something that would gain a headline, whether it

31:27.719 --> 31:41.069
was two minutes on the television or were 10 column 
inches in a paper. Just as a for instance, on the
