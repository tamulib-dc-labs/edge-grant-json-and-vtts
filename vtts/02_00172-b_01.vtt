WEBVTT

00:02.343 --> 00:05.249
My dad was at the Air Force War College on his way to 
Vietnam. We drove over to Maxwell Air Force Base

00:05.770 --> 00:13.325
after graduation before I even shipped out, and my 
mom and dad gave us this Morris Minor, a little

00:05.770 --> 00:13.325
English car. Nancy and I were driving back through 
Mobile. It had an electrical fuel pump in it, and

00:15.730 --> 00:18.575
those points would stick. So I was going over the 
bridge. This is where the tunnel was there, and I

00:21.040 --> 00:23.946
was going over the bridge, And as I went up, that 
damn thing was sticking, so I was having to open and

00:23.926 --> 00:29.253
close the door to give it enough of a shock to stick. 
And then I thought, well, I'll pull over here in a

00:29.273 --> 00:37.804
parking place, and I'll just tie a string onto it 
where I can just yank that string, because we've

00:29.273 --> 00:37.804
got a long ways to go to Galveston, Texas, from 
Mobile, Alabama. Well, as I'm sitting there, and

00:38.244 --> 00:41.909
there was a Texas Aggie thing in back window. As I'm 
sitting there in Mobile, Alabama, just in this

00:41.929 --> 00:48.297
parking lot, somebody drives by, Texas Aggie, 
says, hey, need any help? I said, no, I don't. We

00:49.423 --> 00:50.104
talked for a while. But, I mean, that's gone on. 
When I, more recently, as Director for Operations

00:51.405 --> 01:04.060
out at U.S. Inc. PAC, my, I had a Marine Lieutenant 
Colonel that worked for me, Dave Close, who's just

00:51.405 --> 01:04.060
an absolute Texas gentleman. Just one of the 
nicest men you'll ever meet in your life. Tough,

01:06.422 --> 01:07.564
tough Marine. But it was Dave that came up with the 
strategy that we used in East Timor. We were

01:12.790 --> 01:14.031
sitting around my office. And I was lamenting how I 
didn't want to do like we did in Bosnia and get

01:14.534 --> 01:18.298
bogged down. I wanted to have some sort of a 
rotational presence where we used deployed

01:18.338 --> 01:29.508
forces to go in, get those guys with the machetes, 
get the Australians in there to run the operation

01:18.338 --> 01:29.508
because they're always prancing around saying 
they ought to be doing stuff. And Dave was the one

01:29.889 --> 01:37.136
that took that vision and made it a strategy, which 
even George Bush has talked about. And really a

01:37.356 --> 01:39.478
great guy. So Texas Aggies have been... Of course, 
in my squadron, I mentioned I had an executive

01:42.125 --> 01:46.552
officer just everywhere you go. I always, in the 
military, I knew I could take an Aggie aside and

01:46.753 --> 01:56.368
say, hey, I really need your help on this one. I 
can't explain why, but go work it. There's just

02:00.715 --> 02:02.358
that special relationship. It didn't matter if 
the guy was an ensign. our second lieutenant, we

02:04.045 --> 02:08.891
had a relationship, which you just don't develop 
with other folks. You do it immediately. And you

02:10.053 --> 02:12.957
know that what you're going to get back is going to 
be truthful. It's going to be ethical. It's going

02:14.178 --> 02:18.224
to be the right thing to do from what they know, from 
what they're working with. So, no, I think it's

02:18.244 --> 02:21.188
just marvelous. I will tell you, though, today, 
walking across campus, I haven't walked across

02:21.548 --> 02:29.499
this direction probably in, gosh, 30-something 
years. And I was just amazed at the number of people

02:30.240 --> 02:33.664
that just walked by and, didn't say hi or anything. 
I mean, it really kind of took me back. You know, I

02:37.847 --> 02:43.437
felt kind of silly saying howdy or how you doing, 
you know, and they just kind of look at you and walk

02:37.847 --> 02:43.437
on. So we've lost a little of that, I think, around 
here, which is a shame. Have lost some, but still

02:46.522 --> 02:50.709
compared to the other campuses that I know of. 
Yeah, I mean, there was no unfriendliness about

02:50.729 --> 02:54.977
it, but I just didn't feel the same. And it used to 
be, you know, you'd see an Aggie, you know, hey,

02:55.117 --> 02:58.403
Giggleman. You don't see much of that anymore. 
Everybody kind of looks at you. Some of those

03:00.927 --> 03:05.194
things have gone, which I think is a shame, but 
that's all part of growth. We were only 8,000

03:05.715 --> 03:09.742
people in those days here, I think, in 64, 65. Now 
the entering freshman class is that big. Did you

03:14.770 --> 03:15.792
ever lose your ring? Knock on wood. I flew combat 
with it. That ring, I wouldn't even think of

03:21.702 --> 03:24.306
getting in a jet. uh... without my ring on i'd never 
in fact it was a thing in the military they didn't

03:24.961 --> 03:51.222
want you to wear rings for a lot of reasons if you're 
shot down it's got your name in it and which was

03:24.961 --> 03:51.222
always kind of stupid because name rank and serial 
numbers which you got to give the guys and plus i

03:24.961 --> 03:51.222
never thought the suckers could shoot me down but 
they were you know they they were afraid to get

03:24.961 --> 03:51.222
caught on something as you're climbing in out of 
the airplane but i i always flew with my ring i never

03:24.961 --> 03:51.222
ever went into combat or even flew an airplane 
without my ring i had to get it enlarged a little bit

03:24.961 --> 03:51.222
but Never went anywhere without it. Now, thinking 
about other traditions, you didn't have senior

03:54.381 --> 03:57.806
boots, did you? No, and that was always, you know, 
like I told you, we thought, boy, we really racked

03:57.826 --> 04:03.614
our brains. But can you imagine the Navy blues with 
boots on? You looked just like a Gestapo officer.

04:09.362 --> 04:10.423
And, you know, think about it. That was only 
20-something years after the war. And that was a

04:12.666 --> 04:13.848
big deal. You know, we just didn't want to. We 
didn't want to do that, but I've always, always,

04:15.350 --> 04:19.156
always regretted that. Did you all come up here for 
final review? Oh, you bet. Yes, sir. I would assume

04:23.142 --> 04:30.814
they... Well, of course, I don't know what their 
core is down there now, but everybody was in the

04:23.142 --> 04:30.814
core down there, and yes, we did. We sure did. The 
changes about co-education and all that came

04:31.555 --> 04:36.983
about while you were a student. Absolutely. What 
did you and your buddies think about those

04:37.504 --> 04:39.427
changes? You know, when you were telling that 
story here a minute ago about General Rudder, I...

04:44.054 --> 04:46.999
You know, that never bothered us, or it never 
seemed to. I don't recall anybody jumping up and

04:47.019 --> 04:50.905
down about it. And you know, an interesting thing 
about that, when we started bringing women into

04:50.965 --> 04:58.718
the military, it went, and I recall it going so well 
here. Of course, it really happened after I left.

05:01.522 --> 05:04.527
But I always thought it was the right thing to do. 
And, you know, and... When we started bringing

05:07.358 --> 05:15.687
women onto combat ships and so forth, I had command 
of Mars in Desert Storm and had the first women in

05:07.358 --> 05:15.687
combat. And I went back and talked to Admiral 
Borda, who was a subsequent CNO that shot himself,

05:16.267 --> 05:22.053
and he was going to tell me how to do it. And I said, 
wait a minute, Admiral, you know, this is not a

05:22.073 --> 05:26.197
difficult thing to do. You know, you respect 
people for what they can do, not for what they are or

05:26.538 --> 05:31.763
who they are or how they came about. And that's the 
way you handle it. You don't have to go build

05:35.281 --> 05:37.144
special spaces. On my ship, I've got a Velcro thing 
up there because you only have so many heads or

05:37.244 --> 05:44.834
toilets on a ship. And one says, occupied women. 
Turn to the other and it says, occupied men. And we

05:49.079 --> 05:50.281
just honor it. And I got all my crew together. And I 
had officers, female officers. We hadn't gotten

05:55.948 --> 05:58.071
the female enlisted yet. And I said, look, here are 
my rules. You know, we're adults, and there's not

06:01.282 --> 06:09.872
going to be any heein and sheein on this ship, and if 
I find out about it, I'm going to court-martial

06:01.282 --> 06:09.872
you. Now, respect one another, and let's do our 
jobs, and things will be fine. I subsequently had

06:14.378 --> 06:20.245
some folks, one or the other, get out of the Navy, 
and they got married, and I'm sure that Just like

06:20.596 --> 06:25.222
Nancy and myself, we weren't supposed to be 
married, but we eloped to Angleton in 1966. I just

06:25.403 --> 06:27.946
loved her, and she loved me. There wasn't any 
reason to go do it. We just did. How did you all meet?

06:34.815 --> 06:35.496
On a blind date. I had the duty in Galveston. She was 
a telephone operator in Texas City. I happened to

06:44.729 --> 06:46.992
have the duty. and Carl Fanning, who was there last 
night with his two sons, walked in with his wife

06:47.292 --> 07:08.060
that was sitting next to him, and Nancy, and 
introduced us, and I'd had a real rough night the

06:47.292 --> 07:08.060
night before, so my eyes were real red, so I was 
wearing my sunglasses, and I'm sitting there at

06:47.292 --> 07:08.060
the duty and all this, and I found out later that 
when they walked out, Carl asked Nancy, he said,

06:47.292 --> 07:08.060
well, what did you think about him? And she said 
something to the effect of, well, I don't know, I

07:08.080 --> 07:11.745
couldn't see his eyes. And then we had a date 
subsequent to that in Galveston, I don't know how

07:12.726 --> 07:17.232
familiar you are with Galveston, but the the what 
is now the opera house used to be a movie theater and

07:17.566 --> 07:41.025
we had our first date and it was a you know there's a 
post between us and and then we went to a party or

07:17.566 --> 07:41.025
something and I told her I loved her and she says oh 
yeah I understand I've got your routine and and

07:17.566 --> 07:41.025
then it just worked out and it's 36 years ago well 
actually I was 30 I was 65 so so you what year in

07:17.566 --> 07:41.025
school were you I was a junior when we got married. I 
was a sophomore when this happened, a junior. Then

07:45.623 --> 07:46.745
you moved off campus? Nope. I stayed on campus. As a 
matter of fact, here I was, the Corps Commander. I

07:50.009 --> 07:54.014
got married in December of 66, and in January I 
became the commander down there. And I wasn't the

07:55.496 --> 07:57.619
only one that was married. And we were kind of under 
an obligation not to be married, but other folks

07:57.799 --> 08:03.427
had done it, and you just didn't advertise it. 
Nancy and I didn't. But the rest of the cadets down

08:04.748 --> 08:07.733
there thought I was really a he-man. Because I'd go 
out after I finished studying at night about 10

08:07.753 --> 08:12.601
o'clock and go over to Lamarck. And Nancy and I had a 
room in her house that we were living in. And then

08:15.646 --> 08:20.895
I'd get up early the next morning and these guys 
said, that guy Picket Man, he's out all night. And

08:20.955 --> 08:22.237
God, look at him. This guy is amazing. And of 
course, my grades just went up. Exponentially,

08:26.416 --> 08:31.041
because now all of a sudden, I have the potential of 
having a family to support. We didn't have one. Our

08:32.122 --> 08:37.088
daughter was born five years later, but it was, 
yeah. All right, so when you come up then for final

08:37.108 --> 08:44.717
review, who is here from your family and your loved 
ones? Well, my parents were here, and Nancy was

08:45.758 --> 08:53.166
here, and I think my in-laws, I think, came up. My 
brother was going to school here, so I know he was

08:54.040 --> 08:56.624
here. He was in Seagram 7. And I think that was 
pretty much it. And

09:05.600 --> 09:13.453
where were you guys in the order? I think we were 
last. Last? I think we were tail end Charlie. But

09:16.839 --> 09:18.041
nobody made fun of you? No, no. We always felt very 
comfortable on campus. Everybody except us. You

09:23.480 --> 09:24.240
know, you're an Aggie. So it doesn't matter. You 
know, it doesn't matter as far as I could tell. What

09:28.904 --> 09:30.586
creates that attitude? I don't know. I think 
people that come here come here knowing that's the

09:32.707 --> 09:36.190
way it is. And I think that's what fosters it. It's a 
pride. It's an association with folks that you

09:42.295 --> 09:48.240
know before you ever come here. So all it really All 
you really do is resubstantiate that the longer

09:49.306 --> 09:54.393
you're here and around people that are here. Did it 
matter what your ancestry was or your family?

09:58.999 --> 09:59.780
Never, never. You know, I can't remember ever, 
ever having anyone say anything that was

10:00.141 --> 10:08.952
derogatory. I mean, about anyone or anything. You 
know, well... Ernie Catanzaro, or Sonny

10:12.644 --> 10:18.671
Catanzaro that I was just talking about was of 
Mexican, Hispanic descent. No one ever called him

10:19.192 --> 10:22.396
a Whitback or any of that kind of stuff. I'm trying 
to think, I don't think we had any blacks here that I

10:23.117 --> 10:30.265
can recall. We may have, at least in 65. Somewhere 
about then is when it came in, but But that wouldn't

10:38.851 --> 10:41.094
have been anything. I mean, I just, it never just, 
it never occurred to me one way or the other and it

10:41.234 --> 10:45.299
wouldn't have mattered one way or the other. I 
just, I think it's just something that people come

10:45.899 --> 10:55.531
here with and it just grows while you're here and 
then as you get older and it just, you know, you look

10:45.899 --> 10:55.531
back on it and it's just the right thing to do. 
Ethical thing. As you go through commencement,

10:57.153 --> 11:01.798
every name is called, every hand is shaken. Yes, 
sir. We're all in our Navy dress whites and Vietnam

11:02.179 --> 11:07.525
is already Oh, Vietnam's still going on big time. 
What kind of world did you think you were going out

11:10.367 --> 11:13.391
into? Well, my first trip in the Merchant Marines 
was to Vietnam, and I came back from that. I stayed

11:19.338 --> 11:31.714
in the Merchant Marines long enough, you know, 
because I wanted to fly combat, and, you know, and

11:19.338 --> 11:31.714
our whole class used to talk about that, you know, 
even as freshmen, that, you know, we're here to

11:19.338 --> 11:31.714
serve. You know, that's what we're being trained 
to do, and, you know, And we had a whole bunch of

11:34.876 --> 11:37.359
folks that went off to Vietnam. My roommate, Terry 
Archer, I had no idea about this. We were in Naples,

11:40.482 --> 11:44.206
Florida about two months ago with him, he and his 
wife. And the gals had gone off shopping. And Terry

11:46.789 --> 11:49.932
had this Vietnam book laying on his desk there. And 
I thought Terry, he was a great golfer. He was on the

11:53.116 --> 11:55.979
golf team here and really a super golfer. And I 
said, Terry, what the heck are you really doing in

11:56.860 --> 12:01.545
Vietnam? It's funny, he and I had never talked 
about that because we'd seen each other for years.

12:05.403 --> 12:06.886
And we're both sitting in the lounge. She says, 
well, he says, you know, I was at Anlock and here and

12:06.906 --> 12:09.531
there. And I said, I thought you were doing golf 
courses or something. He says, no. And I said, boy,

12:14.661 --> 12:17.526
you must have really seen some action then. And he 
says, yeah. And I said, I was talking about some

12:19.430 --> 12:22.596
friends of mine that got wounded. And I said, 
you're lucky to get out of there without getting

12:22.756 --> 12:24.660
shot. And he said, I did get shot. And I said, Terry, 
you never told me this. Well, it turns out he got

12:28.234 --> 12:29.756
shot in the rear end. And he was afraid that his dad, 
who was a colonel, like my dad, would say, if you

12:30.457 --> 12:38.828
got, those old guys, you got shot in the back or the 
rear, you were running. And he says, all I did was

12:39.429 --> 12:43.454
just turn and jump over to get behind something. He 
said, I only went about four feet. He said, I was

12:44.636 --> 12:48.741
always afraid my dad would think I was a coward, 
which is kind of interesting. How well prepared

12:49.227 --> 12:53.092
did you think A&M had made you for that real world? 
Let me tell you, that's a great story. Since

12:55.074 --> 12:58.058
graduation, I picked up two master's degrees. 
I've been two fellowships at Harvard and in

12:58.558 --> 13:04.386
national security at the Kennedy School of 
Government. And I will tell you, and I've gone to

13:04.406 --> 13:15.319
the war college, the Naval War College, and it did a 
wonderful job, absolutely wonderful job. Yeah,

13:16.075 --> 13:18.839
it was just awesome. What did it do that was right? 
Well, one, I learned right from wrong. I always use

13:24.226 --> 13:26.449
the term do the right thing. I learned that here. 
Regardless, stand up for what you think is right.

13:30.455 --> 13:35.061
And if you're right, you may lose in the short term, 
but in the long term, you're going to be right. And

13:35.261 --> 13:43.112
it's almost, I used to tell, I still tell Nancy, I 
said, you know, sometimes I think people just,

13:43.733 --> 13:46.477
just want to push me along so you want to see what 
I'll do next. You know, because I've always kind of

13:47.178 --> 13:53.588
taken things on that I don't like status quo. I like 
to make things better. And like women in combat, I

13:56.192 --> 13:59.217
didn't have a problem with that. And it was going to 
work and it was going to work right. And we've had

14:02.442 --> 14:03.964
some other things. We fight fires in the Navy now, I 
changed. In fact, I was talking to some firemen in

14:07.156 --> 14:13.308
Galveston yesterday about this, is that you 
don't, you know, we don't go running into

14:07.156 --> 14:13.308
buildings. Like, you know, why do firemen feel 
they have to run into a house that's already been

14:13.348 --> 14:17.415
evacuated? You know, you want to contain it, and 
you're not going to save a lot of stuff anyway. You

14:22.685 --> 14:27.274
know, don't risk, we do some funny things, you 
know, under a guise of, being brave but we need to be

14:28.469 --> 14:55.607
careful now in this what just happened those guys 
were absolutely doing the right thing I mean who

14:28.469 --> 14:55.607
knew that the towers were going to fall and look at 
all the people they saved and they are heroes been

14:28.469 --> 14:55.607
on a ship and in other areas we know people are out 
and all this there is stuff we'll let it go so I've

14:28.469 --> 14:55.607
always so it's that kind of it's that kind of stuff 
it this school allows you to think on your two on

14:28.469 --> 14:55.607
your feet I think the stress they put us through and 
so forth in the Corps was good uh Was there good

14:56.110 --> 14:59.103
attention to being an individual?

15:01.594 --> 15:06.053
I felt like an individual, but I also felt like I was 
part of a team.

15:07.315 --> 15:09.940
Teamwork to me has always been important. I don't 
need superstars. In the Navy, I used to tell my

15:12.605 --> 15:21.763
folks that, like on an aircraft carrier, I said, 
you know, I don't need a bunch of, you know, a couple

15:12.605 --> 15:21.763
of superstars. What I need are 6,000 folks that are 
all pulling the same direction. and folks that

15:26.452 --> 15:35.545
will come in and tell you, hey, Admiral, that's not 
the right thing to do, or Captain, that's not the

15:26.452 --> 15:35.545
right thing to do, and stand there and take a wrath. 
But then, kind of like you mentioned with River

15:35.746 --> 15:42.776
Rudder, you know, I've made a lot of phone calls 
after it was over and said, hey, listen, come back

15:35.746 --> 15:42.776
in here. You were right. I was wrong. If you were 
hired now as a consultant to advise Texas A&M's

15:46.461 --> 15:51.649
leadership about what to do or not to do in the 
future, what advice would you give them?

16:00.269 --> 16:02.492
What should A&M emphasize? Let me just give you a 
philosophy that I have discovered over the years

16:03.172 --> 16:12.924
and partly by the two fellowships at Harvard 
because you get a chance to dialogue on this. They

16:12.944 --> 16:14.426
were national security seminars. So you're 
generally talking about Russia and how we should

16:15.086 --> 16:19.432
send $3 billion there. There's some pretty 
high-powered folks coming there and lecture. You

16:23.236 --> 16:40.943
know, every time we do this, or we did it as a group, 
and there were 30 military senior officers and 30

16:23.236 --> 16:40.943
senior civilians from industry and from the Civil 
Service, we always came back with the most

16:23.236 --> 16:40.943
important national security issue being 
education. We have somehow got to figure out how to

16:42.585 --> 16:50.998
get into these back areas and get people that 
understand that may not even have the grades, only

16:51.316 --> 16:55.202
because they haven't had a chance to have the 
grades. They've had to do other stuff. And somehow

16:57.064 --> 17:02.632
get those youngsters to be a productive member of 
society. And that takes education. Education is

17:04.374 --> 17:09.442
the absolute key to the security of this country 
and the security of this world. Because the more

17:09.502 --> 17:18.054
you can educate people, the more people are 
educated in the right way, the less apt they are to

17:09.502 --> 17:18.054
be Osama bin Laden's, to be the Taliban. I mean, 
look what he's doing with the women over there. The

17:20.257 --> 17:23.441
reason he's doing it is because if you don't 
educate them, you don't have to worry about them.

17:23.982 --> 17:25.624
You know, they consider themselves stupid. And 
that's something we've got to do in this country.

17:28.707 --> 17:35.175
And right here in Texas, you know, you don't have to 
drive very many streets in Galveston to see people

17:28.707 --> 17:35.175
that haven't had that opportunity. Or in Houston, 
it's all over the place. People that are smart

17:37.338 --> 17:42.184
don't go rob banks in 7-Elevens and those kinds of 
things. And somehow we've got to find a way to do

17:42.844 --> 17:44.927
that. And I don't know if it's a prep school to get 
someone ready to go to school here or what? But that

17:51.291 --> 18:08.438
would be a vision that I would have is how do we take 
this wonderful stuff that we do and get it down to

17:51.291 --> 18:08.438
the lowest levels to people that on just the front, 
they don't have the credentials But inside they

18:08.418 --> 18:11.922
do, and they just haven't had the chance to do it. 
Because, you know, we always, the Colin Powell's,

18:12.423 --> 18:14.646
what do they do? They move out of the areas. And all 
of them do. I mean, all these folks move out of the

18:17.630 --> 18:26.821
areas because they somehow were able to bring 
themselves up, but we need that leadership down

18:17.630 --> 18:26.821
there to get the rest of the crowd out. As you look 
back on your A&M years, to whom are you most

18:27.783 --> 18:37.615
grateful, feel indebtedness to? If they were all 
here today, to whom would you most want to express

18:39.552 --> 18:44.781
your appreciation? Probably to a fellow by the 
name of Jim Hopkins, who was my navigation

18:45.001 --> 18:48.707
instructor. He was a really tough, tough 
taskmaster. And to Mrs. Thiel, who was my Spanish

18:53.775 --> 19:01.628
instructor. In a school that was all boys, all men, 
Mrs. Thiel brought almost a mother side to things.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.943
Is that T-H-E-I-L? T-H-E-I-L. Her husband is a 
doctor in Galveston and is a... I'm an admiral in

19:15.791 --> 19:18.776
the Texas Navy and he's the CNO of the Texas Navy. 
And really a great lady. I haven't seen her in

19:21.380 --> 19:24.586
probably 30 years, but she's a wonderful lady. But 
those two folks probably... more than anybody

19:27.292 --> 19:28.255
else.

19:31.547 --> 19:33.594
I'm about through with the questions. Are there 
any things we haven't covered that we should have?

19:37.147 --> 19:39.851
No, I think I've probably talked way too much. I 
haven't talked like this in years. If someone

19:41.954 --> 19:55.755
walks up to you and gives you a check for a million 
dollars with one condition, you must pass it on to

19:41.954 --> 19:55.755
Texas A&M, but you decide the use to be made of that 
money, what would you want done with that money? I

19:56.115 --> 20:00.842
would start a school, just like I said, a prep 
school that would... that would go into the inner

20:01.582 --> 20:04.569
reaches. I'm not talking about just blacks or 
Hispanics. I'm talking about Caucasians. I would

20:09.380 --> 20:19.603
start some kind of a school, prep school, that 
would get people ready to meet that top 10%, even

20:09.380 --> 20:19.603
though they haven't had a chance in their high 
school years to do it. Because I think there's a...

20:21.427 --> 20:30.465
I think there's that whole group of society out 
there that we're overlooking, that somehow we

20:21.427 --> 20:30.465
have to bring into this world that we live in so we 
don't become elitist. That's just. All right, my

20:33.191 --> 20:34.454
last question then. What feelings do you carry in 
your heart for Texas A&M? Great love. Great love.

20:40.165 --> 20:41.528
It's a wonderful place.
