WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:03.589
the way it ought to be.

00:03.609 --> 00:11.998
We were talking about final review.

00:13.295 --> 00:14.857
We were pretty high off the ground.

00:14.957 --> 00:17.561
We really felt that we were about to take over the world.

00:18.583 --> 00:23.370
You know, that finally really smart people were going to be in charge of the Corps of Cadets.

00:24.291 --> 00:30.840
And while we were tolerant of our upperclassmen, we were on occasion were critical of them.

00:30.860 --> 00:34.886
But more seriously, it was a lot of celebration, a lot of happiness.

00:34.906 --> 00:37.891
And you had senior boots.

00:38.932 --> 00:40.575
Where did you acquire your senior boots?

00:40.595 --> 00:41.396
I bought used boots.

00:41.436 --> 00:42.998
How much did they cost?

00:43.214 --> 00:46.739
$45, $50, something like that.

00:46.759 --> 00:52.348
In fact, I met a guy recently that bought my old boots, but I sold mine at the end of the senior year.

00:52.588 --> 00:54.031
So you passed them on.

00:55.893 --> 00:55.994
Yeah.

00:56.014 --> 01:01.863
And your senior ring, how much did it cost?

01:02.524 --> 01:03.205
I just don't know.

01:03.345 --> 01:07.331
Less than $50, $70 in that range, something like that.

01:07.411 --> 01:09.935
Do you have any good senior ring stories?

01:10.676 --> 01:11.297
No.

01:11.480 --> 01:18.166
Not really, but I do remember that you didn't wear that ring in the latter final review.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.228
You just didn't do it at all.

01:20.868 --> 01:23.671
And I actually got my ring because I'd gone to summer school one time.

01:23.691 --> 01:28.735
I had possession of my ring the second semester of my junior year.

01:30.076 --> 01:33.639
And it would have been death if I'd ever been caught wearing the thing.

01:33.659 --> 01:39.985
So I'd walk around with my hand in my pocket and my ring on just because I was so proud of having it.

01:39.965 --> 01:47.276
go home to Dallas, I'd somehow sneak it on and wear it, being extremely careful because some Aggie didn't see me.

01:47.296 --> 01:47.997
Did you get caught?

01:48.297 --> 01:49.078
Never got caught.

01:49.138 --> 01:51.442
I just knew that some Aggie was going to catch me.

01:52.003 --> 01:57.491
When Sally and I would drive to the movie, I'd wear the ring and take it off when we went to the movie.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.795
It was different than it is now.

02:01.356 --> 02:08.807
What about in the years since then, any special times when someone recognized the ring?

02:09.226 --> 02:10.868
Do you remember any examples of that?

02:10.928 --> 02:12.510
Yeah, there was a very special one.

02:12.730 --> 02:17.456
You know, the Zachary family and how important they've been to A&M.

02:18.056 --> 02:23.643
I did a year of post-graduate study at Johns Hopkins in academic year 64, 65.

02:24.123 --> 02:30.711
And in spring of 65, a friend of mine and I were at a meeting in northern Italy.

02:30.691 --> 02:33.034
in a town called Bressanone.

02:33.074 --> 02:37.859
It's up in the Austrian kind of mixed area of northern Italy.

02:39.080 --> 02:42.824
That friend and another friend decided to go to Venice.

02:43.905 --> 02:48.270
So we got on a train out of Bressanone like midnight going south to Venice.

02:50.713 --> 02:54.657
We sat in a compartment and there was a lady in that compartment and she kept

02:54.637 --> 02:59.843
My two friends were Chinese and we were talking like you will do.

03:00.264 --> 03:04.569
I noticed she kept looking at me and finally she said, is that an Aggie ring?

03:05.650 --> 03:09.455
It was Bartel Zachary's mother, H.P.

03:09.475 --> 03:10.576
Zachary's wife.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.721
He met the train in Venice.

03:14.741 --> 03:16.864
He was there on business or something.

03:16.844 --> 03:24.460
Last time I ever saw him, of course, last time I ever saw her, but I'd known him as a student.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.364
He was quite visible on campus.

03:26.484 --> 03:30.412
I think he became a regent about the time I graduated.

03:32.136 --> 03:34.701
He was a regent part of that time.

03:35.693 --> 03:47.950
Why have senior rings remained, why have Aggie rings remained such a mark of this institution?

03:48.291 --> 03:50.174
Well, I think it's a combination of things.

03:50.214 --> 03:58.866
I think the all-male, like the history of the place in terms of military, I think the...

04:00.567 --> 04:06.555
poorly understood culture of the place, that we value tradition and things don't change.

04:07.296 --> 04:17.250
I think the fact that there's only been one ring, you know, there's not four or five different choices when you graduate, and there's been a discipline about you don't get the ring until you have a certain number of hours.

04:17.831 --> 04:24.680
You know, some universities, you can go to any store near the campus and buy a ring, and the rings lose their identity.

04:24.700 --> 04:26.523
There are several conversions of it.

04:26.743 --> 04:29.427
I'm grinning because when I was president at UTEP,

04:30.487 --> 04:32.150
One day we were talking about this.

04:32.170 --> 04:35.916
I had a UT System meeting in Austin.

04:36.457 --> 04:37.759
I walked down Congress Avenue.

04:37.939 --> 04:43.929
I walked into a jewelry store and asked them if I could buy a graduation ring from the University of Texas.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.453
They asked me,

04:47.277 --> 04:52.222
pay for it with cash or credit, and what design would you like on the ring?

04:53.663 --> 04:55.805
Not only could I buy one, there were umpteen choices.

04:55.825 --> 04:57.006
In a lot of places that way.

04:57.047 --> 05:01.551
But if you look at places that have protected their ring, it has evolved over time.

05:01.591 --> 05:03.333
The ring takes on greater importance.

05:03.793 --> 05:04.954
Rice protects its ring.

05:05.775 --> 05:15.985
Rice, in the old days when I was there and when you were there, if somebody got a ring and then, say, dropped out of school, Rice would go after them and want the ring back.

05:15.965 --> 05:24.011
A&M, theoretically, you get the ring, it's yours, even though you've got your 70-some-odd hours or 90 hours, I guess it is.

05:24.051 --> 05:26.700
Theoretically, you could walk and not ever graduate.

05:27.440 --> 05:41.880
And as far as I'm aware, the only schools today that still treasure the ring are the academies, a few Ivy League-type schools, and A&M, maybe Clemson, Virginia Tech.

05:43.202 --> 05:44.143
There aren't many of them there.

05:44.183 --> 05:46.326
Many, though, that are trying to get back.

05:47.548 --> 05:52.675
Oklahoma State, I understand, is trying to create a unique ring and set some standards for it.

05:52.735 --> 05:56.400
Of course, it'll be generations before that takes on the identity.

05:57.477 --> 06:03.634
In recent years, have you detected any degeneration in interest in the ring?

06:03.694 --> 06:04.298
I have not.

06:04.497 --> 06:05.919
I think it's intensified.

06:05.999 --> 06:20.755
What I think has happened to A&M is that certain icons have become more important as the place has become more of a comprehensive university with a diverse population, men, women, and so forth.

06:21.396 --> 06:25.200
I think some of the icons have taken on more important.

06:25.620 --> 06:30.606
Some social scientists claim this is common in culture.

06:30.586 --> 06:35.352
As changes occur, you lock on to certain icons and they take greater value.

06:36.493 --> 06:41.239
Some people interpreted the intense interest in the bonfire as an example of that.

06:41.300 --> 06:49.630
It's a relic from our past, in some sense, and it's symbolic of that past.

06:50.351 --> 06:56.779
What are the other events that are important in this Aggie spirit or pride?

06:59.307 --> 07:05.132
You know, that is too complicated I think for a dumb engineer to answer.

07:07.222 --> 07:12.727
Our ability to change but not change is kind of something that's hard to understand.

07:12.747 --> 07:19.513
The place has changed dramatically, but we've always had a certain affection for each other as a family.

07:20.434 --> 07:33.025
It's always been pretty solid academically, and maybe in places where we didn't achieve sort of academic excellence in the sort of Harvard-MIT sense, we certainly had rigor and demanding programs.

07:33.045 --> 07:35.727
I think that's kind of our conservative nature.

07:35.707 --> 07:38.451
And people remember and value that experience.

07:38.471 --> 07:41.817
They relate back to it and associate with it.

07:42.598 --> 07:48.848
But the thing which is really peculiar is that the old Aggies can come back now and see things which they relate to.

07:48.868 --> 07:51.692
That the icons are still there.

07:51.913 --> 07:53.275
And what are those icons?

07:53.295 --> 07:54.677
Well, people speak to you.

07:54.657 --> 08:13.453
the respect that we show for the place we are, it's clean, we're kind to each other, the symbolic things like the core, the way they look, the way they present themselves, the yell leaders, all those kinds of things basically have not changed.

08:14.174 --> 08:24.563
Now, someday those yells will be delivered by a woman, maybe more than one, but it will look the same in one sense.

08:24.543 --> 08:26.727
The band looks the same.

08:26.947 --> 08:30.994
Our silver taps, bonfire, midnight yell practice.

08:32.897 --> 08:34.760
Midnight yell practice changed a lot.

08:34.920 --> 08:36.362
Silver taps hadn't changed.

08:36.422 --> 08:40.048
The bonfire engrossed hadn't changed.

08:40.269 --> 08:41.651
Detail changed a lot.

08:42.412 --> 08:46.759
The muster really hadn't changed much.

08:46.779 --> 08:50.365
What about commencement where every name is called and every hand shaken?

08:50.564 --> 08:53.467
It hadn't changed, and it's wonderful.

08:53.587 --> 08:54.548
It's in danger.

08:55.269 --> 08:55.870
It really is.

08:56.030 --> 09:05.961
If you go to commencement Friday, there will be, start out with 1,100 or 1,200 people sitting there, and if it's like the last one, 200 of them will be left at the end of the day.

09:07.042 --> 09:08.383
Let me turn this off.

09:09.665 --> 09:15.852
We were talking about the key parts of what A&M really is.

09:18.374 --> 09:19.896
What is A&M spirit?

09:20.551 --> 09:22.514
Well, I don't think anybody can define it.

09:22.574 --> 09:24.156
It's an affection for the place.

09:24.236 --> 09:30.625
It's the feeling of family and the closeness people feel towards each other and by implication towards the place.

09:31.626 --> 09:35.751
The spirit, whatever it is, is the driver for all these traditions.

09:35.912 --> 09:42.200
As John Hagler explained it better than I can, it's the manifestation of the spirit.

09:42.661 --> 09:46.626
That's why the traditions change, but the spirit is the commonality.

09:46.606 --> 09:53.677
I think it has its roots in things like young men having to march off to World War II.

09:54.539 --> 10:01.990
I think it has its roots in people coming off the farms in Texas and being transformed by this education.

10:02.792 --> 10:09.863
I think it has to do with a lot of sort of intangible kinds of things that have occurred over the history of the university.

10:09.843 --> 10:15.792
And the irony of it is a lot of these things have occurred at other places, but somehow it's had a different effect here.

10:16.853 --> 10:33.538
And no one would, I think, ever have expected any of these elements of the university to be strong today, having their origins back in this small all-male university that sort of matured in the 30s and the 40s and the 50s.

10:34.328 --> 10:45.402
During your era, was there a mix in the student body in terms of the kinds of families from which your fellow students came?

10:46.782 --> 10:53.913
Mixed geographically, everybody was kind of middle class, poor, very few signs of wealth.

10:54.934 --> 11:03.287
There were not a huge but a significant number of Hispanic kids here, but you never talked about this Mexican guy down in the hall or something.

11:04.308 --> 11:11.659
The culture was so strong and your class system was so strong that basically you try to find your friends and survive.

11:11.723 --> 11:12.726
And some Jewish kids.

11:13.007 --> 11:14.432
Yeah, some Jewish kids, sure.

11:15.656 --> 11:16.941
Not many international.

11:17.904 --> 11:22.881
I couldn't identify one if I had to now, but I'm sure there were some.

11:23.671 --> 11:28.857
And did students have nicknames for each other?

11:29.078 --> 11:30.319
Everybody had nicknames.

11:30.339 --> 11:30.860
What was yours?

11:31.180 --> 11:31.961
I'll never tell you.

11:32.061 --> 11:34.724
Oh, okay.

11:34.744 --> 11:36.667
Can you share the nicknames of some others?

11:36.807 --> 11:38.389
Well, John Hagler and I have a deal.

11:38.409 --> 11:40.391
He won't tell mine if I won't tell his.

11:40.752 --> 11:43.335
What about some others that are tellable?

11:44.676 --> 11:46.759
Well, there's a guy that we call Smutch.

11:47.195 --> 11:51.060
His name is Jack Nelson, who's not active at A&M now.

11:51.501 --> 11:53.603
I've talked with him one time since I've been back.

11:54.344 --> 11:55.726
But really everybody had nicknames.

11:55.746 --> 12:02.034
And those nicknames generally were acquired here, sometimes justifiably and sometimes otherwise.

12:02.175 --> 12:07.421
Well, it depends on who you ask, but most times there was justification for them.

12:08.162 --> 12:11.667
And were used kind of within the Aggie family.

12:12.102 --> 12:14.366
Oh, definitely.

12:15.128 --> 12:17.632
I think probably everybody on the Corps' staff had a nickname.

12:17.652 --> 12:23.984
There was this one wonderful guy named Jim Groves, and he's got a prominent nose, and he was Hose Nose.

12:24.004 --> 12:24.265
Was what?

12:24.425 --> 12:25.187
Hose Nose.

12:25.247 --> 12:25.928
Hose Nose, okay.

12:25.948 --> 12:26.489
Hose Nose.

12:26.569 --> 12:29.094
And if I talk to him today, he's Hose Nose.

12:29.114 --> 12:35.005
And, you know, I may talk to him once every ten years, and you revert back to that.

12:35.761 --> 12:43.103
Your senior year then as you're on your, what was your, you were deputy?

12:43.163 --> 12:43.965
Deputy Corps Command.

12:43.985 --> 12:45.670
When did you learn you were going to be?

12:46.426 --> 13:04.150
When I learned I wasn't going to be corps commander, it was automatic that you became, they had the commandant and his staff had an interview process and of course they've been watching you all year long and so forth and they made the selection based on that interviews and their accumulation of information.

13:04.891 --> 13:07.675
And when John got to be corps commander, I was automatically dead.

13:07.735 --> 13:09.177
And they interviewed how many?

13:09.477 --> 13:14.644
They interviewed all the corps staff juniors, whether it's that five or six that I remember.

13:15.198 --> 13:20.323
And again, as far as you're aware, it was done equitably?

13:20.363 --> 13:21.464
Yeah, I think so.

13:22.244 --> 13:29.211
There was speculation that they tried to alternate Army, Air Force, and that seemed to be kind of the pattern.

13:29.671 --> 13:38.038
But we were never challenging or, let's say, uncomfortable or critical of the process.

13:38.339 --> 13:41.982
And the choice had no effect on your friendship with John?

13:42.082 --> 13:43.163
Not really, not really.

13:43.835 --> 13:45.677
Not at all.

13:45.777 --> 13:48.200
Then as seniors, were you all roommates?

13:51.604 --> 13:52.265
Yeah.

13:52.685 --> 13:55.528
Was there ever any time when you had to fill in for him as deputy?

13:55.949 --> 13:56.770
Yeah, occasionally.

13:59.252 --> 14:04.178
He was always constantly being asked to appear at some kind of public event.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.319
If he couldn't, I would go.

14:05.359 --> 14:12.087
We were sort of in tandem for most situations.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.905
And it's during that year that you all meet Mr. Rutter.

14:15.366 --> 14:16.909
Yeah.

14:16.929 --> 14:27.890
In some sense, the corps commander had a lot of sort of external public kind of responsibilities, and the deputy corps commander was more of the internal kind of person, probably like it is now.

14:27.910 --> 14:32.539
What were some of the internal corps problems you all had to work with?

14:32.958 --> 14:36.866
Actually, I guess the one I was laughing about was my junior year.

14:36.906 --> 14:38.148
We did a terrible thing.

14:39.270 --> 14:51.574
The tradition was the week before the SMU game, the freshmen were Spurs, and I guess now they do it for the Tech game since we don't play SMU anymore.

14:53.107 --> 14:57.812
At one of those ball games, the week before the SUU game, we were juniors.

14:58.032 --> 15:01.656
And we thought the sophomores had done something inappropriate in Kyle Field.

15:01.676 --> 15:05.861
They sort of did something insulting, which I can't remember now what it was.

15:06.462 --> 15:09.725
So we made the sophomores wear Spurs.

15:09.745 --> 15:11.888
And that was a tough one for them.

15:11.928 --> 15:16.112
And the core staff juniors really caused that to happen.

15:16.333 --> 15:20.397
And somehow I ended up in kind of the focus of that.

15:20.377 --> 15:27.738
But I've met people in recent times that they're still mad at me for making them wear spurs when they were sophomores.

15:28.259 --> 15:32.952
Was there any attempt at retaliatory action by sophomores?

15:33.100 --> 15:37.927
Yeah, they've made valiant efforts to steal our blouses before the junior ball and stuff.

15:37.947 --> 15:40.872
That was also one of those perverse traditions.

15:40.952 --> 15:45.178
If as a sophomore you didn't try, you're a bunch of sissies.

15:45.739 --> 15:47.982
But if you did it, you're in deep trouble.

15:49.665 --> 15:51.488
You're faced with some ambiguity there.

15:52.449 --> 15:54.973
My senior year, there was a...

15:54.953 --> 15:57.598
Nothing a major thing.

15:57.618 --> 15:58.500
Some concerns.

15:58.520 --> 16:07.516
There was a lawsuit attempting to force the university to admit women, and we were concerned about the implication of that.

16:07.656 --> 16:14.008
As a student then, what did you and your buddies think about the admission of women?

16:14.022 --> 16:14.843
Oh, it was terrible.

16:14.963 --> 16:16.365
It was the end of the earth.

16:16.465 --> 16:31.302
And I'll tell you, because I don't think this is going to get too broadly distributed, is that there's a photograph of me in a Houston newspaper in my uniform expressing great concern about admitting women to A&M.

16:31.322 --> 16:35.406
And one of my nightmares is that when I'm president of A&M, somebody will find that.

16:36.067 --> 16:37.429
I think the chances are slim.

16:37.489 --> 16:39.591
This is a paper that's long went out of business.

16:39.571 --> 16:44.979
Did anyone ever mention racial integration during that era?

16:45.300 --> 16:45.520
Never.

16:45.961 --> 16:48.805
I certainly wasn't aware of it.

16:49.246 --> 16:59.301
That would have been an easier issue to address and react to positively than letting in women.

17:00.985 --> 17:08.425
again require compulsory membership in the Corps was made your senior year?

17:08.665 --> 17:09.568
As we were going out.

17:10.149 --> 17:11.653
And what was the reaction to that?

17:11.920 --> 17:16.248
I think it actually occurred about as we graduated.

17:16.348 --> 17:17.210
We were pleased with it.

17:17.490 --> 17:25.946
We thought that was the natural state of affairs and thought that assured the Corps of Cadets from that point forward.

17:26.988 --> 17:35.464
I think it happens now, but what happened then, as seniors, we were pretty confident that we knew everything.

17:35.444 --> 17:45.990
The first semester was sort of defined by us being very much with the program, very supportive of the university administration and everything that was happening, very much team players.

17:47.112 --> 17:51.403
We became so expert, we became critics in the spring.

17:51.503 --> 17:53.588
We could see our time ending.

17:53.568 --> 18:04.426
And we began to have concerns about the future of what we were doing and the future of the university and questions about the strength of our academics and everything.

18:04.486 --> 18:10.777
So we became more critical and cynical, I think, toward the spring.

18:11.698 --> 18:18.630
And so we were watching very closely what the board was doing with the Corps and this lawsuit and things like that.

18:18.982 --> 18:23.889
How well prepared did you and your colleagues think you were for the real world?

18:24.630 --> 18:26.313
See, I went straight to graduate school.

18:26.413 --> 18:28.576
And frankly, I had a shock.

18:28.656 --> 18:32.963
I went to Caltech to work on a master's degree in mechanical engineering.

18:33.784 --> 18:36.668
And I felt somewhat disadvantaged.

18:36.748 --> 18:42.677
I felt like that the preparation I had for what I confronted out there was really not very good.

18:42.657 --> 18:45.621
But what did you think it was before you got there?

18:46.462 --> 18:48.945
I was concerned, quite frankly.

18:48.965 --> 18:54.432
The perception in those days that mechanical engineering was not as progressive as it should be.

18:54.452 --> 19:02.904
I think Dr. Semang was the only PhD on the faculty, and it seemed to be about a half generation behind.

19:03.144 --> 19:06.268
It was sort of the perception we had.

19:06.248 --> 19:08.692
And I hit this shock when I got to Caltech.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.415
I became convinced of that.

19:10.595 --> 19:18.347
Now, frankly, looking back at it in a more realistic way, I think they gave me the fundamentals, and I frankly made very good grades at Caltech.

19:18.868 --> 19:26.280
And I don't think I would have done that if I'd been as poorly prepared as I perceived I would.

19:26.781 --> 19:30.467
What else did A&M do well as you look back?

19:32.624 --> 19:38.658
I think the leadership responsibility you got, you're allowed to make mistakes.

19:38.698 --> 19:41.945
You're allowed to take on complicated decisions.

19:42.647 --> 19:48.079
One of the things that we became involved with my senior year was an effort to get an honor code in the Corps.

19:48.561 --> 19:49.543
It was not successful.

19:49.583 --> 19:51.848
The culture just wouldn't support it.

19:51.828 --> 20:02.000
In that debate, all that year long, I probably learned as much about human nature and the way people articulate their concerns as I did any time in my life.

20:02.881 --> 20:11.671
So the fact that the core culture would let young people sort of engage something like that and attempt something like that, I thought was, I think, significant.

20:12.592 --> 20:21.042
Learning to deal with people, learning all different kinds of people in stressful situations as well as fun situations.

20:21.022 --> 20:27.698
Of course, I think everybody gets that to an extent when they're young and in college.

20:30.103 --> 20:36.398
By the time you were a senior, were there any key faculty or staff members to whom you turned for counsel?

20:36.867 --> 20:43.296
Dr. Semang got to be a good friend, and that was reinforced when I came back as a graduate student.

20:44.137 --> 20:51.588
I really developed those faculty connections more as a graduate student than I did as an undergraduate.

20:51.608 --> 20:52.910
You know, there were people here.

20:52.930 --> 20:54.873
Mr. Penberthy was a very good friend.

20:54.953 --> 21:04.967
Carl Wilkins, the assistant commandant, became a good friend, someone I had great respect for.

21:05.993 --> 21:12.845
And there was no international conflict or anything that was hanging over a brief period?

21:13.286 --> 21:15.810
There was Sputnik.

21:15.950 --> 21:18.515
I forget the exact date of Sputnik, but there was great concern.

21:18.555 --> 21:21.139
I think it may have occurred as soon as we were leaving here.

21:22.241 --> 21:25.487
Dr. Harrington became a good friend.

21:27.779 --> 21:36.295
our senior year, of course, he was president, and he lived right across the street from Durham 12.

21:36.395 --> 21:38.019
Actually, I got to know him as a junior.

21:38.139 --> 21:39.622
We were in Durham 2 my senior year.

21:40.624 --> 21:42.447
Mrs. Harrington was a

21:44.080 --> 21:45.081
got to know Sally.

21:45.782 --> 21:47.525
She was a mutual friend.

21:47.585 --> 21:50.008
Sally got to know Mrs. Herrington.

21:50.028 --> 21:54.954
We thought she was the best looking older woman we'd ever seen in our lives.

21:54.995 --> 21:56.717
She was probably 40 years old at the time.

21:57.878 --> 22:00.201
He was such a kind, nice person.

22:00.622 --> 22:02.865
John and I got to know him pretty well.

22:02.845 --> 22:06.231
And he was always, his office was open to us and everything.

22:07.173 --> 22:09.637
And I can remember seeing him when I was a graduate student.

22:09.657 --> 22:11.160
He was just a fine person.

22:11.260 --> 22:21.839
Grown up in Plano, so he would, as a beginning faculty member, when he used to come to speak at the awards thing, we used to always chuckle.

22:21.940 --> 22:23.883
He pronounced the word so-sation.

22:24.624 --> 22:26.408
The so-sation of former students.

22:26.508 --> 22:26.608
Yeah.

22:26.588 --> 22:31.662
Everything else was perfect, perfect, perfect, but he had that special pronunciation.

22:31.702 --> 22:39.484
As you look back, what else did you learn?

22:41.185 --> 22:43.047
from those four years at A&M?

22:44.449 --> 22:46.051
Well, I think it's the thing we talked about.

22:46.131 --> 22:50.316
I think sort of how to deal with people is probably the most important lesson.

22:50.376 --> 22:57.325
Obviously, I learned some discipline in my studies and I learned how to confront the academics in a successful way.

22:57.365 --> 23:03.733
But being able to deal with people, making friends, resolving conflicts,

23:03.815 --> 23:07.600
You're not yet married, but probably getting close to it.

23:07.640 --> 23:11.205
We got married July after I graduated.

23:11.325 --> 23:13.728
Sally graduated from SMU in three years.

23:17.073 --> 23:24.743
Describe final review and commencement and who came and what was it like?

23:25.246 --> 23:26.047
It was a lot of fun.

23:27.188 --> 23:28.089
My family was there.

23:28.129 --> 23:29.370
Of course, Sally was there.

23:29.430 --> 23:30.732
We were sad.

23:30.792 --> 23:33.234
The year had ended too fast.

23:34.796 --> 23:38.800
One thing that happened then that's different now, though, we left almost immediately.

23:38.820 --> 23:44.066
Within an hour and a half or two after final review, we were in the car gone.

23:44.086 --> 23:49.752
Now they'll sit around and talk for a couple days and sort of disengage very slowly.

23:50.221 --> 23:52.607
Do you even remember who the commencement speaker was?

23:52.827 --> 23:52.988
No.

23:54.050 --> 23:54.972
The commencement was held?

23:55.754 --> 23:56.516
In G. Raleigh.

23:56.536 --> 23:57.118
In G. Raleigh.

23:57.138 --> 24:01.889
I can remember getting out of my seat, going up on the stage, and walking across it, getting it upon.

24:02.651 --> 24:04.255
But I have no idea who the speaker was.

24:05.317 --> 24:07.302
And I'm a believer that

24:07.653 --> 24:18.354
A very, very important part of A&M's strong feelings is that name being called, that hand being shaken, and it's the real diploma.

24:19.235 --> 24:22.501
I believe it would be a very great mistake to say, I hereby confer.

24:23.864 --> 24:26.770
We'll change that under great duress.

24:26.870 --> 24:28.513
We won't do it frivolously.

24:28.983 --> 24:39.247
we're probably going to put that out there as a speculation trying to get people to think about it, think about what they're doing by leaving the arena.

24:40.129 --> 24:42.975
I believe that if the last official event

24:43.934 --> 24:50.667
If the individual is recognized, and if it's a pleasant experience, then it's warm.

24:51.168 --> 24:56.478
If there's a snafu, a foul-up, then it all goes bad.

24:57.700 --> 25:06.938
The example I would give would be what Jarvis failed to do when Melody Zintgraf 20 years ago this spring.

25:06.918 --> 25:15.370
I was seated next to Bill Hobby who had been the speaker and she was standing that close to us when Jarvis didn't shake her hand.

25:16.672 --> 25:24.724
Her family thought we had deliberately connived to make her the last of the last of the last.

25:24.839 --> 25:28.147
It was the Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, Friday night, Saturday morning.

25:28.808 --> 25:31.414
She was in biomedical science, veterinary medicine.

25:32.076 --> 25:35.885
You graduate by alphabetical order, by college, by major, by name.

25:37.548 --> 25:39.373
So she was the last one to graduate.

25:39.413 --> 25:41.317
I didn't realize that.

25:41.397 --> 25:43.843
She was the last one to walk across the state.

25:43.823 --> 25:45.926
All that public attention was drawn there.

25:45.966 --> 25:52.937
See, I often wondered with all that rush up there, people coming by, how anybody would notice except this little small group up close.

25:52.978 --> 25:59.067
But you see, if you're out in the audience, you're saying, okay, come on, we're about ready to go.

25:59.107 --> 26:00.870
And then there was hissing.

26:01.340 --> 26:06.527
And I was sitting next to Hobby because he had said, come, let's chat.

26:06.787 --> 26:08.669
When you get out there to UTEP, stay in touch.

26:08.689 --> 26:10.031
We've known each other 20 years.

26:10.091 --> 26:11.974
Maybe I can help you with a special item.

26:11.994 --> 26:13.315
Well, I was really impressed.

26:14.136 --> 26:17.300
And I'm getting ready to go back to my seat, and I hear some hissing.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.302
And I said, oh, my goodness.

26:18.342 --> 26:19.043
He said, what do you mean?

26:19.683 --> 26:22.367
I said, they're hissing the couriest.

26:22.387 --> 26:24.029
That means they don't like something.

26:24.229 --> 26:27.313
And I glance to my right, and I see her.

26:27.293 --> 26:30.740
And I called her by name and he said, oh, she's been a pain in my neck.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.703
She's complained so much.

26:33.024 --> 26:33.846
Good gracious.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.910
Well, I wouldn't dare get up then.

26:36.932 --> 26:38.755
Jarvis hands her her diploma.

26:39.577 --> 26:41.320
She takes it in her right hand.

26:42.059 --> 26:50.129
moves it to her left, then puts her hand out, and he then says, in my memory, no way I'm going to shake your hand.

26:50.630 --> 27:04.607
Well, everybody kind of goes, Brian Cole, whom I just interviewed this morning, was one of the name callers, and he said he noticed one regent turned to another and said, that's it, that's it.

27:05.296 --> 27:16.078
When we got back to the Letterman's Lounge, I remember a number of people saying, Serves are right, I wouldn't shake her hand, she's been a pain in our neck.

27:16.539 --> 27:24.655
I'm gone, and the day we arrive in El Paso is the day that he learned that he was no longer going to be president.

27:24.635 --> 27:35.751
I understand hearsay that when the board summoned him over and told him that, the first thing they threw at him orally was, you refuse to shake hands with an Aggie.

27:35.771 --> 27:45.265
What I learned in UTEP, not knowing that I might have had the same thing, there was a real, real troublesome activist student out there.

27:45.905 --> 27:49.090
He had reporters in the audience to trap me.

27:49.880 --> 27:52.286
Because they were going to take pictures and take notes.

27:52.547 --> 27:53.569
I wouldn't shake his hand.

27:53.689 --> 27:56.176
When his name is called, I clapped.

27:56.316 --> 27:57.198
I did like this.

27:57.359 --> 27:58.942
I said, mi amigo.

27:59.584 --> 28:02.351
And he came over and he said, I wondered if you would shake my hand.

28:02.491 --> 28:04.496
I said, I am so delighted you're graduating.

28:04.596 --> 28:06.842
I can't wait for you to walk off this stage.

28:06.822 --> 28:08.124
That was his response.

28:08.184 --> 28:10.047
He laughed.

28:10.127 --> 28:13.412
We stood there, both of us laughing and smiling.

28:13.632 --> 28:17.618
I share that with many people.

28:17.859 --> 28:26.552
What I learned from those two was give every student what they deserve on that occasion.

28:26.532 --> 28:33.639
be careful to be fair and to be gentle, that if you have a private fight that's different.

28:33.939 --> 28:41.586
Embarrassing someone in public is a treacherous damn thing.

28:41.606 --> 28:42.707
It's not worth it.

28:42.768 --> 28:43.328
Don't we know.

28:43.368 --> 28:53.097
Near the end, what have we not included that we should have?

28:54.459 --> 28:55.780
How about your student days?

28:56.553 --> 29:01.479
There was a character that was around here that was bigger than life named Henry Dittman.

29:01.880 --> 29:03.001
Well, Pinky was too.

29:03.101 --> 29:04.043
I thought you were going to say.

29:04.063 --> 29:05.024
Well, Pinky who?

29:05.184 --> 29:06.145
Henry Dittman.

29:07.287 --> 29:07.887
Pelley Dittman.

29:08.028 --> 29:09.089
Pelley was his nickname.

29:09.149 --> 29:11.392
He was the professor of air science.

29:11.432 --> 29:14.035
He was a bird colonel in one eye.

29:15.077 --> 29:18.341
And he was a patent-like character.

29:18.781 --> 29:24.028
He was a real pain in the fanny to...

29:24.008 --> 29:26.994
to Rudder, the commandant, particularly Davis.

29:27.054 --> 29:30.301
He and Davis were so out of step.

29:32.386 --> 29:44.110
Thinking back to your question about people we were close to, we were close to Dittman, both Hagler and I. In fact, Dittman almost convinced Hagler to give up the Army to go into the Air Force.

29:44.090 --> 29:45.995
But he was fired.

29:46.376 --> 29:46.977
He was a tiger.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.022
He had been grounded.

29:49.043 --> 29:51.188
He had been a pilot, lost his eye, and he was grounded.

29:51.228 --> 29:52.712
He lost his right to fly.

29:52.832 --> 29:55.058
Every time he got near a plane, he'd make them let him fly.

29:55.098 --> 30:00.732
And he was bigger than life, all over this campus, and he was behind all sorts of stuff.

30:00.712 --> 30:06.959
He was constantly attacking the authority of the commandant through the students.

30:06.999 --> 30:07.680
Terrible stuff.

30:08.922 --> 30:12.606
But he was a source of great excitement around the campus.

30:13.187 --> 30:14.568
He was a real character at the time.

30:14.628 --> 30:22.197
After he retired from the service, he surfaced in Houston as kind of the chief of staff of

30:22.177 --> 30:26.902
another John Lindsey, the John Lindsey that was the county judge down there.

30:26.922 --> 30:28.404
He's now the state senator.

30:28.424 --> 30:31.106
And he worked for him for years until he retired again.

30:32.067 --> 30:35.171
But a strong Aggie, loud, opinionated.

30:36.012 --> 30:38.714
This was right after Correa.

30:38.795 --> 30:45.241
And he had this talk he gave, this fire and brimstone talk about always being a tiger.

30:45.842 --> 30:46.783
And he'd talk about the

30:46.763 --> 30:47.244
Turks.

30:47.845 --> 30:54.414
Apparently the Turkish army was totally immune to brainwashing during Korea.

30:54.494 --> 30:55.596
You just could not reach them.

30:55.616 --> 31:02.325
They'd put them in prisons and they'd try to take their leadership away from them and damn somebody else would pop up as a leader.

31:02.466 --> 31:04.949
The Americans would fall apart.

31:04.989 --> 31:09.756
