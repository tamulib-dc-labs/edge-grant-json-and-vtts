00:01.617 --> 00:06.823
economic forces play a great role in shaping any 
community. How would you say that economic

00:06.843 --> 00:11.989
influence has been an impact in planning in 
Austin? Austin's been very fortunate, as I think

00:13.871 --> 00:17.996
you'll find most centers of government. With the 
high percentage of government employment,

00:23.065 --> 00:25.650
Austin's been immune from the business cycle. 
Recessions don't tend to hit Austin.

00:28.715 --> 00:30.639
Unemployment doesn't tend to hit Austin. We've 
always had one of the lowest unemployment in the

00:30.659 --> 00:35.007
entire state, if not the nation. For a city in the 
size category. Well, for any city, really. For any

00:40.637 --> 00:41.319
city. I think it's characteristic of most centers 
of government.

00:48.378 --> 00:50.902
So Austin has not been diversified. It's been made 
up of three sectors, government, military, which

00:50.982 --> 01:01.720
is not a tremendous amount, but it's significant, 
and the city of Austin. The city of Austin is one of

01:01.860 --> 01:06.568
the largest employers in the entire area. 
Primarily because they own the utility system,

01:06.588 --> 01:12.698
there's over 8,000 employees in the city of 
Austin. It's been in the past five years, or maybe

01:13.471 --> 01:26.148
since the beginning of the Austin Memorial 
Program in the early 70s, that the Chamber of

01:13.471 --> 01:26.148
Commerce began a very strong and well-financed 
operation to diversify Austin's economy. That

01:26.749 --> 01:38.685
has resulted over the past three years with a very 
noticeable and predictable shift of electronics

01:26.749 --> 01:38.685
manufacturing from Silicon Valley in California 
near San Francisco. Firms are coming to Austin to

01:45.085 --> 01:47.729
establish new plants. There's very good reasons 
why they're doing that. They find that in

01:50.974 --> 01:54.719
California they're robbing from each other now 
for the talent pool. And here's Austin with a huge

01:55.981 --> 02:01.929
university, a tremendously good environment, 
and a new opportunity. Well IBM came, Texas

02:02.169 --> 02:06.816
Instruments came, Now we find Data General 
Corporation coming. We find three or four other

02:10.442 --> 02:17.672
computer firms moving in from Silicon Valley and 
other parts of the country. And we see Austin's

02:18.312 --> 02:25.082
electronic manufacturing employment 
skyrocketing. As an example, five years ago,

02:26.764 --> 02:36.077
there might have been two lines of advertising for 
electrical engineering people semiconductor

02:36.428 --> 02:37.670
people. Now there's two pages of them. And 
Austin's headed down the same road as Silicon

02:40.234 --> 02:42.678
Valley. There will be a saturation, in my view, in 
the next ten years of electronics firms. As a

02:48.888 --> 02:53.436
result, Austin is liable to face the same kind of 
activity that Silicon Valley had. A tremendous

02:53.456 --> 03:00.968
competition for labor, increased labor costs, 
and of course with that will come greater

02:53.456 --> 03:00.968
in-migration more white collar and higher 
educated people and you will see Austin continue

03:01.960 --> 03:08.991
to attract the white collar, high income pool of 
people. Where has that type of so-called clean

03:09.973 --> 03:13.759
industry been sown in Austin? Anywhere they want. 
Anywhere they want. Undeveloped land usually or

03:18.867 --> 03:22.854
has land been cleared, let's say slum clearance? 
No, there's been no clearance. There has been no

03:25.278 --> 03:28.643
centralization either. IBM is just going through 
a doubling in the size of its plant. Texas

03:34.224 --> 03:40.374
Instruments, about 8, 9, 10 miles away, outside 
the city limits, was only annexed a few years ago.

03:40.974 --> 03:44.940
There's two large firms in the south just coming 
in. There's one in the west. Motorola has its

03:46.202 --> 03:48.546
second plant location. It has a large 
semiconductor facility on the east side. Tracor

03:51.730 --> 03:58.360
Corporation, which is a large electronics 
manufacturer, is on the east side. And so they're

03:59.015 --> 04:00.617
just ringing the city. There has not been a 
dedicated interest because of the price of cheap

04:01.398 --> 04:04.863
land. And the availability of land, there's not 
been any interest in coming in and going to the

04:05.744 --> 04:12.794
expense of clearing and going into an inner city. 
Mobility is easy in Austin. It doesn't take very

04:17.220 --> 04:20.164
long to get north, south, east, or west. And so they 
choose the cheapest alternative that they can. Do

04:25.791 --> 04:27.874
planners receive a great deal of problems, 
though, in that type of sphere where industry is

04:28.225 --> 04:39.957
more or less encircled with city and 
transportation needs have to be taken care of, new

04:28.225 --> 04:39.957
residential patterns are established. How are 
these planned for? I'd say right now, from my

04:41.759 --> 04:44.722
knowledge, they're not being planned for. 
They're accepted. The city of Austin many years

04:46.144 --> 04:51.870
ago began the development of ring freeways. and 
though citizens have expressed opposition to

04:52.981 --> 05:08.177
that, we find that a significant highway's been 
built right through the hill country,

04:52.981 --> 05:08.177
significant bridge is going to be built right over 
the lake that was not really beneficial. No one

05:08.217 --> 05:10.660
wanted it to happen, but the state did it anyway.

05:13.323 --> 05:14.604
Tremendous conflicts there. I see Austin 
continuing down the road of an inner loop, and then

05:15.045 --> 05:21.992
an outer loop, virtually the same shape that 
American cities have taken all over the country.

05:26.349 --> 05:28.833
We've almost completed the inner loop. We've 
already seen plans for an outer loop. And though

05:32.419 --> 05:39.690
there's none under construction, we now have 
freeway presentations and freeway proposals

05:32.419 --> 05:39.690
being looked at for other arteries of this 
community. And I think that runs counter to the

05:40.832 --> 05:44.297
master plan. But yet, everything continues in 
spite of that. It also seems to run counter to the

05:47.822 --> 05:50.106
master plan that growth is to be managed, but at the 
same time, clean industries are courted without

05:50.423 --> 05:59.760
real regard for the consequences of their 
relocation in the Austin area. Is that a

06:00.662 --> 06:01.884
significant problem? Yes, and it's significant 
from two points. One is that the city planning

06:03.848 --> 06:10.159
department is not involved in planning for the 
economic growth of this community. That's not a

06:10.780 --> 06:12.263
role that they've had. the Chamber of Commerce, 
through its economic development activities,

06:12.766 --> 06:29.265
has been the recruiter, will remain the 
recruiter, and goes out and gets these people,

06:12.766 --> 06:29.265
then the issue before the planning department has 
characteristically been, is this appropriate

06:12.766 --> 06:29.265
land use, and can we serve it with utilities? If the 
answer is yes, they go there. So, it's reactive.

06:35.793 --> 06:39.297
It's reactive planning, and that's what's 
unfortunate about Austin. We find ourselves

06:39.428 --> 06:50.182
looking down the road in a master plan, but 
because, as I view it, it's vague, we are

06:39.428 --> 06:50.182
constantly reacting to what industry wants to go 
where. We don't have a land use map of saying, no,

06:50.242 --> 06:53.126
you can only go here. Changes have occurred in the 
master plan, in the maps, and in zoning to

06:53.927 --> 06:58.753
accommodate those industries. As a result of 
their relocation. As a result of their proposal to

07:00.736 --> 07:05.402
come to the city, having been recruited by the 
Chamber of Commerce. How about the role of heavy

07:06.817 --> 07:11.201
industry as part of the economic base there? They 
have not come to Austin because the Chamber of

07:11.221 --> 07:20.589
Commerce has determined, and they will tell you, 
we're members of the Chamber. To the extent that

07:22.631 --> 07:31.659
Austin is Austin and we want to keep it that way, the 
Chamber of Commerce has taken the role that they

07:22.631 --> 07:31.659
should bring new jobs for the expanding 
population. They don't want heavy industry, and

07:32.480 --> 07:35.743
the city doesn't want heavy industry. So as a 
result, heavy industry doesn't come here because

07:36.145 --> 07:39.669
they won't recruit them. They do feel their 
responsibility is to Central Texas more than it is

07:40.590 --> 07:48.838
to the city of Austin because the Travis County 
people do not believe in growth control. And we are

07:50.840 --> 08:05.916
seeing plants built north of the city outside the 
city limits in Round Rock and in areas north of

07:50.840 --> 08:05.916
there because this is a regional question and not 
In that regard, in planning, there has not been an

08:07.060 --> 08:21.141
agreement at the Capital Area Planning Council 
who may have a responsibility to look at the

08:07.060 --> 08:21.141
regional aspects of growth and the regional 
aspects of development. There has not been, to my

08:21.482 --> 08:29.634
knowledge, any dialogue that would come up with an 
agreed-upon plan for the regional development of

08:21.482 --> 08:29.634
this area of the state. As a result, everybody's 
out fighting each other. With the... With these

08:36.068 --> 08:49.464
incoming electronic industries, with the great 
number of governmental employees that are in the

08:36.068 --> 08:49.464
Austin area, I would imagine that the average 
income level is higher than it would be for most

08:36.068 --> 08:49.464
other Texas cities. Is that the case? And how does 
the income level of the residents relate to

08:51.366 --> 08:56.332
planning decisions? Well, I'm not sure what you 
could say about the average income of Austin. It's

09:06.359 --> 09:09.463
difficult to compare it with Houston. It's higher 
than San Antonio. Houston and Dallas I'm not sure

09:13.047 --> 09:14.909
of. Other cities of half a million, Fort Worth or 
so, I'm not sure of that either. The relative

09:21.116 --> 09:28.204
wealth of the community is important in Austin 
because that determines where federal funds are

09:21.116 --> 09:28.204
to be spent. And that is very closely watched. But 
as far as the average income of Austin being higher

09:31.908 --> 09:35.893
than than other comparable cities. I don't think 
that's the case, but I don't know. University

09:41.283 --> 09:43.566
professors aren't paid all that much. There's a 
lot of them. State employees, I don't know, the top

09:44.987 --> 09:50.094
salary may be $40,000 a year. That's not 
significant. But having so many people that...

09:55.300 --> 09:56.722
There aren't many in that level, though. There 
aren't very many in the $40,000 level, but I don't

09:56.942 --> 09:59.646
know. It's not like being in Dallas and having 
insurance and banking executives making

09:59.666 --> 10:04.632
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

10:10.366 --> 10:19.098
Have there been problems in the past as far as 
federal grants programs and minority groups and

10:10.366 --> 10:19.098
getting their acceptance of these programs in 
their areas? There's been problems with one, but

10:20.901 --> 10:28.811
beyond that there's been a general problem, and it 
relates to income. The city does not have a, is not

10:29.893 --> 10:35.040
considered a distressed city. It doesn't fall 
into a Laredo category or a San Antonio category.

10:41.610 --> 10:45.494
There is not a tremendously widespread incidence 
of poverty. There are a lot of poor people, but

10:46.195 --> 10:49.879
there are a lot of people who are not poor. And so 
Austin's problem has been one that many of the

10:50.840 --> 11:03.913
federal programs designed to help those who need 
help, and we have a significant number, are not

10:50.840 --> 11:03.913
eligible for Austin to apply for because we do not 
have sufficient poverty, we do not have

11:05.007 --> 11:09.271
sufficient decay to meet the criteria. Austin has 
forever fought that. To say that we have 25,000

11:12.894 --> 11:28.168
people who are poor, and just because we don't have 
56,000, which was 30% of the population or so, we

11:12.894 --> 11:28.168
shouldn't be singled out and not allowed to get 
those benefits. And we've fought forever to do

11:28.188 --> 11:29.489
that. Austin has had a great history of 
participation in federal programs. The only one

11:34.252 --> 11:48.812
that I'm aware of that was defeated by the 
reluctance or opposition of minority groups has

11:34.252 --> 11:48.812
been the overall economic development plan, 
which involved EDA funds that would have allowed

11:34.252 --> 11:48.812
planning and public works funds. The suspicion 
was that this was a program to build downtown at the

11:49.974 --> 11:55.822
expense of the poor. The poor would be used as an 
excuse to gain eligibility. But once that

12:01.430 --> 12:03.212
eligibility was granted, It was a mistrust that 
the council would actually use the funds for their

12:03.665 --> 12:07.990
benefit.

12:11.073 --> 12:17.380
We'll never know if that was valid because as a 
result of their opposition, the council voted not

12:11.073 --> 12:17.380
to pursue the matter. And so after about a year, the 
minority groups indicated that they felt they

12:18.261 --> 12:29.133
were being used and didn't want to be done that way 
unless there was some guarantees they could

12:18.261 --> 12:29.133
control the program. The council said that they 
didn't feel that was an appropriate role. And so

12:33.770 --> 12:36.313
they decided not to submit the application. And as 
a result, the groups that were intended to be

12:37.774 --> 12:41.218
benefited suffered. I believe so. I know that at 
least $200,000 in federal planning assistance

12:43.320 --> 12:55.252
for economic development did not come to this 
city, of which advance approval had already been

12:43.320 --> 12:55.252
granted. And that occurred when?

13:00.652 --> 13:00.972
1978. 1978. January 1978.

13:08.743 --> 13:17.776
Is there anything else that you think is 
significant as regards Austin and planning and

13:08.743 --> 13:17.776
elements in its history that have affected 
planning here? I think there are issues right now

13:17.796 --> 13:27.469
before the city that the citizens and the 
commissions refuse to acknowledge or fail to

13:17.796 --> 13:27.469
understand. The community in its master plan has 
determined that it should be a compact city to

13:28.698 --> 13:43.161
avoid the problems of sprawl and to encourage and 
protect its inner city neighborhoods and the

13:28.698 --> 13:43.161
residential quality of the city. That means 
you've got to have higher densities in a compact

13:44.844 --> 13:54.580
city, and you've got to accommodate growth 
corridors, and you've got to take care of mass

13:44.844 --> 13:54.580
transit. It's the only way to avoid sprawl. But 
while they say that, on one hand, they have

13:57.082 --> 14:07.937
repeatedly voted to prohibit increased 
densities in the inner city and to attempt to limit

13:57.082 --> 14:07.937
heights and densities of developments. And the 
two are violently and totally opposite. It sounds

14:12.303 --> 14:15.368
like irreconcilable differences in a divorce 
contest. Very similar. And unfortunately, what

14:17.471 --> 14:26.143
has occurred from that is while those loggerheads 
have existed, the community wants integrity.

14:26.545 --> 14:56.400
compact growth they want managed growth but they 
don't want any higher densities as a result of that

14:26.545 --> 14:56.400
major new developments are occurring four five 
six miles from the city center in the southwestern

14:26.545 --> 14:56.400
part of the city a very sensitive area a giant mall 
three malls announced within a mile of each other

14:26.545 --> 14:56.400
huge office centers being proposed high density 
apartments being built the same in the northwest

14:26.545 --> 14:56.400
community and i believe that as uh As should be 
learned, if one were to look at Houston with a high

14:57.933 --> 15:08.927
density core and then other nodes of high 
densities, Austin is heading right down the same

14:57.933 --> 15:08.927
line and has yet to recognize that. As far as 
problems between planning for Travis County and

15:11.670 --> 15:22.303
planning for Austin City, are there significant, 
you mentioned earlier, that Travis County is more

15:22.655 --> 15:25.058
growth-oriented. They're not concerned 
particularly with growth management. They want

15:27.481 --> 15:28.922
more population. Has that come into conflict with 
the goals of Austin City on occasion? Yes, it has.

15:35.670 --> 15:41.837
The county has not established a formal planning 
department program. They've had people who've

15:41.857 --> 15:45.842
carried out that responsibility from time to 
time. But the county has been in conflict with the

15:45.862 --> 15:50.147
city on occasion primarily in regards to its 
transportation programs. Where the new highways

15:53.590 --> 15:57.573
are going, should freeways be built, and where are 
those freeways? The county has supported those

15:57.613 --> 16:03.779
while the city has expressed reservations and 
concern. Those have been resolved sometimes in

16:04.620 --> 16:16.550
split votes and other activities at the Austin 
Transportation Study Level, which is the

16:04.620 --> 16:16.550
Metropolitan Planning Organization for 
Transportation. City planning doesn't play a

16:17.691 --> 16:19.813
direct role in that either. That has been a 
transportation role directed by the

16:20.570 --> 16:26.960
Transportation Department of the city, and there 
have been many, many conflicts. Have there been

16:27.621 --> 16:35.894
occasions for joint Austin City and Travis County 
Planning Commission meetings to decide this type

16:27.621 --> 16:35.894
of area-wide problem? There's no planning 
commission in Travis County. Oh, I'm sorry,

16:38.238 --> 16:39.900
there's no commission. No, the only thing they 
have is the Travis County Commissioner's Court.

16:43.886 --> 16:47.472
There has never been, to my knowledge, any joint 
meeting with the planning commission. There has

16:48.245 --> 16:53.631
been only on occasion informal meetings between 
the county commissioners and the city council. So

16:54.572 --> 16:59.437
needs and goals don't exist in the county. Don't 
exist. And that often comes in direct conflict

17:00.979 --> 17:06.165
with what Austin City has envisioned and planned 
for. Yeah, let me give you a very concrete example.

17:09.669 --> 17:15.315
During the Jeff Friedman Council there was a long 
discussion about Mopac Boulevard from its

17:09.669 --> 17:15.315
northern well from its point of town lake south 
through the Martin Creek area, a very

17:15.548 --> 17:20.714
environmentally sensitive area. The city's 
position was that the thing should be built with

17:21.975 --> 17:35.371
limited access and no frontage roads so that it did 
not encourage growth along the corridor and would

17:21.975 --> 17:35.371
therefore be just a transportation link and 
absolutely nothing else like a parkway through a

17:21.975 --> 17:35.371
park. It was outside the city limits so the city 
could not exercise any kind of direct controls.

17:42.802 --> 17:48.651
The county, however, agreed with the 
construction of the highway as it would normally

17:42.802 --> 17:48.651
be, frontage roads, bridges, and all that. Since 
the county was purchasing the right-of-way, they

17:49.172 --> 17:55.182
were the ones who were the deciding issue. As a 
result, the highway is now built, will almost be

17:55.202 --> 18:00.771
open in the next few months or so. We'll have 
frontage roads, exit ramps, all of the things that

18:01.291 --> 18:07.541
will lead to a further densification of the area. 
And that was a direct conflict. beyond the city of

18:10.797 --> 18:23.591
Austin's control because it was outside the city 
limits and totally under the discretion of the

18:10.797 --> 18:23.591
county, who had other constituents, had 
industries, had other activities that said, we

18:10.797 --> 18:23.591
need that highway. And it was done that way. The 
same thing's occurring in far west Travis County

18:26.174 --> 18:34.123
as future planning is taking place for new loop 
freeways. The city of Austin has not supported

18:35.504 --> 18:39.589
those, has not even voted on them. Yet the planning 
continues in spite of the master plan that says do

18:39.839 --> 18:44.649
not grow into the western part of the county.

18:48.517 --> 18:52.184
Well, thank you very much for your time, and I 
appreciate your opinions on this. Good. The

18:53.126 --> 18:54.008
information you've given us. You're welcome.
