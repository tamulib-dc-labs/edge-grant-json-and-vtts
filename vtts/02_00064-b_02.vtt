WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:04.001
a lot of important people.

00:07.345 --> 00:22.163
I was a little apprehensive about serving in 
things like Norwegian sardines, and they were

00:07.345 --> 00:22.163
very popular, and those mussels on a half shell, 
and they're very popular again. They just seemed

00:23.064 --> 00:29.312
to, I guess that they were so seldom anywhere until 
it was just a novelty of some kind. But they'd take

00:33.953 --> 00:36.056
them and eat them. And I was always amazed at that. 
We started at our buffets, by the way. We would have

00:43.123 --> 00:50.992
a lot of fruits and desserts types that they could 
pick up and take on over to the game if they wanted

00:43.123 --> 00:50.992
to. And of course sometimes they would, not very 
much. But I really I remember the time that we

00:58.047 --> 01:25.067
started dipping the fruits in the hot chocolate, 
which was old hat to a lot of people, but there

00:58.047 --> 01:25.067
seemed to be a certain group, too, that really 
thought that was something special and

00:58.047 --> 01:25.067
appreciated the strawberries and some of the 
dried fruits like apricots were very good dipped

00:58.047 --> 01:25.067
in chocolate. Well, it was always, if you could 
think of something extra to do, like Dick Cutchish

01:25.840 --> 01:37.240
and his method of serving, and you recall him. He 
had a method of putting a plate together. He always

01:42.909 --> 01:51.544
used romaine leaves underneath the entrees, and 
he could make any plate attractive to him. And I

01:52.452 --> 01:57.157
always told him, I said, Dick, you can touch a plate 
and make it look better. And that was almost true,

01:57.177 --> 02:00.261
almost true. And then he'd work hours late at night 
at serving the biggest elaborate, elaborate

02:00.281 --> 02:07.890
banquet you could think of. Go home and eat a peanut 
butter and jelly sandwich. Now, in the facilities

02:12.755 --> 02:21.185
here, how long could y'all keep fresh lettuce, for 
example, before it was served? How many days? Oh,

02:23.907 --> 02:36.604
well, of course, you get it in the head and you cut 
it, and you'd probably, if you didn't serve it one

02:23.907 --> 02:36.604
day, sometimes it'd be good the next. Probably you 
wouldn't keep it beyond the second day. All right,

02:40.209 --> 02:43.213
if you haven't broken up the head, how long can it 
be? Oh, well, that's about a week. A week? Nothing

02:45.656 --> 02:46.057
like that. All right, then fresh beef or pork or 
chicken that hasn't been frozen, how long can it be

02:46.077 --> 02:53.847
kept in the cold storage? Well, uh, and chill 
stove. Well, that's served, that's a week or two

02:57.089 --> 03:01.213
easily. So then there was, there were fresh 
vegetables, fruits, and meat arriving daily or

03:01.534 --> 03:09.922
weekly? No, no, no. We didn't use much fresh beef. 
We used, uh, we used a lot of the, sometimes the

03:13.326 --> 03:17.671
steaks would be. But most of it came in frozen. 
Okay. Most all the meats. And it would once per week

03:23.392 --> 03:28.558
or per month or what? Well, that depended on how 
fast we were using it, but we'd try to get enough to

03:29.480 --> 03:40.954
last maybe a month when we bought something, 
unless it was a very special item. There were very,

03:40.974 --> 03:48.743
very few times we would have something that was 
just for that one occasion, but it was sometimes

03:40.974 --> 03:48.743
that way. It would be one time, but mostly it was... 
something we could hold because you got good

03:52.298 --> 04:20.483
enough storage you can keep most anything that's 
not a fresh product now a carload of beef normally

03:52.298 --> 04:20.483
would come from where geographically kansas city 
omaha colorado okay midwest one of those places

03:52.298 --> 04:20.483
the plains okay uh did you ever have any difficulty 
i'm going to use the word politically that we were

04:21.205 --> 04:27.991
not buying enough from a certain part of the 
country and we were buying too much from some other

04:21.205 --> 04:27.991
part? Did anybody ever complain? No, but we had a 
very closely associated problem. We used to buy

04:32.976 --> 04:38.401
canned beef that was packed in South America. Ah, 
okay. Under our people's jurisdiction, Swift and

04:39.442 --> 04:48.411
Company and Armour, and the Beef Growers 
Association found out about that. Went to the

04:49.235 --> 04:54.381
state and had the law changed so that we couldn't do 
that anymore. That was one of the finest beef

04:54.401 --> 04:57.664
you've ever seen. No fat, tender, firmly packed, 
and we had to quit using it. Was that law in effect

05:05.152 --> 05:06.914
when you retired? Yes, yes. As a matter of fact, it 
had been a number of years before I retired that law

05:09.156 --> 05:16.204
went into effect. Any restrictions on canned 
goods and their origins, national origin? Not

05:22.441 --> 05:23.582
national origin. We never would have considered 
buying anything canned other than packed within

05:23.602 --> 05:29.831
the United States. That all has to be under USDA.

05:34.778 --> 05:38.823
Now what are some points that I haven't written 
down that I haven't thought of that you must have?

05:38.843 --> 05:41.787
Well, one of the interesting points is that the 
opinion of people always thought that we got all

05:42.172 --> 05:51.760
our food from the campus, A&M Farms. And the only 
product we got from A&M consistently was milk. And

05:57.526 --> 06:00.608
the funny thing happened there, my old friend O.D. 
Butler was in charge of the dairy, among other

06:00.628 --> 06:03.931
things. When I came here, I found that I could take 
bids out of Dallas and have it delivered to me

06:04.712 --> 06:10.457
cheaper into the dining hall, then he would set it 
on the back dock. So I started taking bids for milk.

06:17.722 --> 06:29.315
Well, the first thing he heard about it, he had a 
call from Oak Farms in Dallas that wanted to know

06:17.722 --> 06:29.315
how much he wanted to sell the dairy for. Asked him 
why. He said, well, you must be selling it because

06:30.557 --> 06:35.002
they didn't buy their milk elsewhere. So I used to 
tell the joke that O.D. walked over on his knees to

06:40.171 --> 06:41.913
talk about it. I didn't know he was using those 
funds to support his dairy. I thought it was an easy

06:46.399 --> 06:51.064
sale anywhere that he was just selling us a sort of 
flavor. Well, he said, no, he said, it's really

06:52.126 --> 06:54.789
important. He said, don't want to lose that 
business. I said, well, you know, you're hiring

06:59.394 --> 07:02.098
everybody. So he explained then the southern milk 
shed and the northern milk shed. I said, well, that

07:06.163 --> 07:08.085
doesn't matter a hoot to me. I said, I bought milk. I 
was in the military and we furnished milk from

07:09.876 --> 07:14.221
where we got it the cheapest. We have to do that. We 
got a dollar and a half a day per person for three

07:15.202 --> 07:21.288
meals a day. So he said, well, you know, I've always 
been for food service. I want to do whatever I can

07:25.352 --> 07:27.234
for you. And I said, well, see what you can do. So he 
lowered, he figured the price down for us. And we

07:31.958 --> 07:36.823
were always good friends, but it couldn't have 
gone the other way because I was totally innocent

07:37.158 --> 07:40.883
about the fact that he was depending on that. 
Another thing is, I guess you know this story, it

07:41.384 --> 07:59.571
was in a, or may not, a lot of people don't know, it 
was in this book on the moms, it was a book, Moms,

07:41.384 --> 07:59.571
Aggies, Moms, and Apple Pies, about the $40,000 
pie. Well, that's the way we got Duncan Hall, my

07:59.973 --> 08:04.720
friend E.H. Schmidt. I learned this story and got 
him together with the author of this book and got it

08:05.100 --> 08:10.388
printed. And he was the head baker here, and 
Roosevelt came here in the late 1930s. And so he

08:20.282 --> 08:29.895
baked him an orange chiffon pie, probably the 
original orange chiffon out of natural

08:20.282 --> 08:29.895
ingredients, nothing... This orange juice and 
all the things that go with orange chiffon pie. And

08:34.374 --> 08:38.800
President Roosevelt liked this pie real well. So 
our physical plant went over and built a

08:38.820 --> 08:44.409
refrigerator on his rail car. Mr. Schmidt had 50 
pies cooked for him to take back to Washington with

08:45.711 --> 08:51.059
him. Well, when it came time to build the Duncan 
area, they didn't have the money. So Elliot

08:56.126 --> 08:59.832
Roosevelt was on the board of directors. So he gets 
in touch with his dad to get a loan. Well, the story

09:06.667 --> 09:10.251
is, the great influence were those pies. And that 
each pie was worth $40,000. It came out, 50 pies,

09:16.217 --> 09:22.404
$40,000 to build the entire Duncan area. And to 
further about that story, and this may be

09:22.424 --> 09:29.532
partially hearsay, was that really it was, 
Elliot's mother who got interested in the lawn and

09:30.119 --> 09:36.525
really was the power behind it. You mean Elliot? 
You mean Eleanor Roosevelt? Yeah, Eleanor. And

09:40.830 --> 09:44.874
the money then was loaned, I think, by Jesse Jones. 
And one of the reasons that I found it a little bit

09:45.695 --> 09:54.844
amusing, we were still paying on Duncan when I came 
back here. in 1965, and I don't know when it was paid

09:55.921 --> 10:01.629
off, but we were still paying on Duncan. Because it 
is a bond. All right, Duncan is a new facility when

10:03.492 --> 10:07.597
you arrive as a student? Yes, it finished in 39. I 
got here in 40. And Hotard said the first year he

10:12.384 --> 10:23.059
operated that he was afraid to go out among the 
students because all the equipment he had was just

10:12.384 --> 10:23.059
to boil You had to boil the meat, boil the 
vegetables, boil everything. He said he couldn't

10:27.858 --> 10:31.022
fry or couldn't bake anything. So he said, I didn't 
even go out among where anybody could see me. But

10:37.330 --> 10:42.657
that became the $40,000 pie, and that story's in 
that book. All right, who are some other

10:42.677 --> 10:48.304
celebrities that you remember serving in the 20 
years plus? Oh, Governor Connolly was here, lots

10:51.265 --> 10:57.033
of the governors, and they just came here 
routinely. And before my time, one of the people at

10:57.434 --> 11:08.570
the Sabisa that was there said Clarence Darrow had 
eaten in the Sabisa.

11:08.890 --> 11:14.098
And the Prince of Saudi Arabia was dying there. But 
the governors was about as high as we ever had, to my

11:14.118 --> 11:18.544
knowledge. Now, after they

11:18.878 --> 11:34.239
built the new facilities, they began to have some 
dignitaries, a couple of presidents and those

11:18.878 --> 11:34.239
people there, but not in the dining halls. They 
never came down to that place. They'd be serving.

11:38.745 --> 11:41.909
You were looking at your notes for some other 
items. Oh, well, let's see. We covered nearly

11:43.070 --> 11:44.412
everything. We got $1.50 a day. That was what 
you... Oh, at early on? Yes, and it was hard to break

11:51.006 --> 11:52.987
out of that. That was the cost of the food and 
beverage? For the day. For the day? For each

11:58.733 --> 11:59.534
person. When you left, when you retired, reckon 
what that figure was? Oh, it was not, not, it was

12:03.397 --> 12:10.284
about double that, about double that. And we had a, 
we had a big menu. That was for one entree, of

12:12.706 --> 12:19.092
course, and two vegetables, and dessert and 
beverage. And Sebesa alone had 28 entrees, which

12:19.443 --> 12:28.378
might have been too elaborate, I don't know, but 
now they keep adding to it. In your years, did the

12:30.942 --> 12:45.366
cost of supplying food for students, were the 
costs higher in Duncan or Sebesa, or were they

12:30.942 --> 12:45.366
about the same? Maybe a little higher in Duncan, 
particularly at times. The food cost in the

12:50.739 --> 12:53.743
university always runs high. For male students, 
it always runs a little higher than that. And for

12:57.428 --> 13:01.053
places restricted. Of course, the missed meal 
factor is the only way we survive. That's the only

13:05.299 --> 13:07.682
way we survive. And that was true when I was a 
student. Of course, when I was a student,

13:09.424 --> 13:12.829
everybody ate every meal except on the weekend. 
Everybody tried to leave on the weekend. Well, it

13:15.451 --> 13:17.614
had changed. When I got here, they missed a lot of 
meals, but they had a little more money. They could

13:22.260 --> 13:25.805
eat outside, and they skipped other meals. I 
finally got it reduced to 20 meals a week because it

13:26.146 --> 13:34.998
was just too intense in some ways. And so, it's been 
that way since. Uh, it's, it's, it's interesting.

13:41.635 --> 13:44.239
I, I don't know whether I'd do it if I had to do it or 
not. I told somebody once, I thought I'd decorate

13:45.261 --> 14:00.443
flowers, uh, and decorate with flowers instead, 
because you could work for hundreds of hours at

13:45.261 --> 14:00.443
Escalona Buffet, and the most elaborate thing 
you've ever seen was special setups. And about 30

14:00.463 --> 14:08.475
minutes before the, the, the, the, oh, you open the 
doors, here comes the florist dancing in and puts a

14:00.463 --> 14:08.475
few flowers together. The first person that walks 
through there says, what beautiful flowers.

14:14.731 --> 14:16.514
When you all had worked days off. Except for 
Governor Clements. He saw the food. Did he? That's

14:21.161 --> 14:21.682
true. Most of them did, really. Let's see.

14:28.813 --> 14:34.362
Did we finish a while ago on advice to the A&M 
leadership today that you might have? Well, maybe

14:34.949 --> 14:37.613
we didn't. I would hope that they would give good 
support to the Department of Field Services and

14:37.853 --> 15:04.348
give them liberty to operate so that they could 
operate in a manner in which they knew would

14:37.853 --> 15:04.348
respond to the desires of their customer, which is 
a student, which is always a little removed from

14:37.853 --> 15:04.348
administration, further removed than it is from 
the people within the operations. And that's

15:05.105 --> 15:11.934
about the only thing I would want them to do. But the 
main thing is to guard against the going outside to

15:12.154 --> 15:29.698
seek the commercialization of their operation 
when they can get good people within their own

15:12.154 --> 15:29.698
establishment. Let's see.

15:33.218 --> 15:42.429
whether it involved you directly or not, what's 
your favorite Aggie funny story, amusing story? I

15:42.449 --> 15:44.151
don't know that I have one. I never gave that any 
thought. I guess it's the fact that... What you

15:56.067 --> 16:02.614
call an Aggie five years after graduation

15:56.067 --> 16:02.614
is lost. If I had been down, I never gave that much 
thought. All right. Then I guess just about the

16:09.141 --> 16:25.838
last one would be let's make believe that someone 
comes in and gives you a big

16:09.141 --> 16:25.838
cash gift and says, I want you to, I'm talking about 
big money, And I want you to give it to whatever it is

16:26.307 --> 16:33.877
at A&M that you care most about, that you would most 
want to help. What would that, where, to whom

16:33.957 --> 16:38.063
would, or to what area or areas would you give it? 
For what purpose? Well, if it's enough money, I'd

16:40.726 --> 16:48.637
say to start a school on food management.

16:48.657 --> 16:50.900
Because I tried to get that done for many years. I 
wrote the first letter on it in 1966. Right. And

16:56.058 --> 17:05.649
President Rudder, with appropriate 
clarification, Howard and others, and asking

16:56.058 --> 17:05.649
that we get something going. And nothing 
happened, so Dr. Potts found out about it and said,

17:06.990 --> 17:12.557
let me take over that. And he tried as hard as 
anybody could to do that. But every time we'd get in

17:16.341 --> 17:20.746
gear for it, they'd say, well, this is not the time 
for that. And this went on for years. In the

17:22.708 --> 17:25.491
meantime, all these other schools went ahead and 
did it. And what happens, the fact that we don't

17:26.686 --> 17:38.964
have that means that we have all this technical 
training, and we have down here all this ag science

17:26.686 --> 17:38.964
training. But right here in the middle is a hole. 
And that hole is made up of food management. It

17:45.253 --> 17:52.103
could easily be incorporated within things we 
already have, like merchandising and It's a

17:52.572 --> 17:54.634
fairly large national industry. It is the largest 
employer, one of the three or four largest

17:55.135 --> 18:03.745
employers consistently within each state and 
within the nation. And I've had people come to me

18:05.988 --> 18:13.656
and say, well, you know, we've already trained 
dieticians. I say, yes, but the top food

18:13.676 --> 18:17.601
management hires dieticians. And that's good, 
but dietetics is part of it. So we have never had

18:23.869 --> 18:27.833
that, and probably never will. For some reason, 
the people within an institution like this that

18:28.514 --> 18:42.208
are scientifically inclined particularly feel 
that it's just a little beneath the dignity.

18:42.248 --> 18:44.230
There's not enough science in it. I said, well, 
I've told most of those people that I've heard, I

18:45.087 --> 18:50.473
said, well, there's both science and art. It 
combines everything. And I'd always hoped, but I

18:53.436 --> 18:57.501
would still try that. I was offered, Mr. Sabiza's 
grandson once came up, and we were in a down period,

18:57.541 --> 19:06.350
and he heard about our efforts. He didn't have a lot 
of money, but he had He had $25,000. He said, I've

19:10.233 --> 19:13.898
got $25,000 I want to give you for this school. At 
the time, I said, there's no use. It's on the bottom

19:15.740 --> 19:18.104
of the barrel. And we'll have to wait for better 
times. That was a Mr. Kerr. And he had told me a lot

19:26.255 --> 19:30.922
about his dad. And granddad, he was. He died in 
Cuba. I didn't know that. Well, she's buried out

19:38.497 --> 19:40.379
there. Yeah. But they died in Cuba. Was he on 
vacation? No, no, his son. Oh, I see, I see. Because

19:46.586 --> 19:48.748
he was Austrian, wasn't he? Yes, yes, he was 
Austrian. They had to give him some gold to come

19:50.510 --> 19:53.233
over here. That's right. He had storms, and a 
firefighter ran him out of Galveston. He was a very

20:00.220 --> 20:02.022
ingenious individual. That's what I heard. 
Ingenious person. And so was Hotar. And Duffy

20:06.206 --> 20:07.227
might have been. I didn't know. I didn't know much 
about country, but I know that Seville and Oak

20:07.960 --> 20:16.314
Grove are outstanding in many respects. Well, you 
carried on in a splendid fashion in your

20:17.636 --> 20:21.202
tradition. I got by. And I'm grateful to you for all 
that you've meant to this university, and I thank

20:22.845 --> 20:28.133
you for your time today. If I've been anything, I'm 
grateful. Oh, thank you.
