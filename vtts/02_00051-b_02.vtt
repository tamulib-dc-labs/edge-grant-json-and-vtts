WEBVTT

00:02.731 --> 00:04.894
Didn't feel intimidated by him in any way.

00:04.974 --> 00:08.980
He was just a guy who wanted Aggies to feel good about themselves.

00:09.841 --> 00:10.321
J.E.

00:10.341 --> 00:10.782
Lupo.

00:11.323 --> 00:12.625
Oh yeah, old Army Lou.

00:13.686 --> 00:20.415
I can still remember when we played in the Cotton Bowl in 67.

00:20.756 --> 00:26.924
I had just finished school and, matter of fact, I was in the Army in San Antonio at that time.

00:27.745 --> 00:29.127
And I never will forget

00:29.596 --> 00:42.470
I walked in the Cotton Bowl in the end zone, and I started near the bottom of the stands and started walking up, and who should loom right up in front of me but old Army Lou, and all he would say was, you good Aggies.

00:43.311 --> 00:51.441
And he was just trying to make sure everybody had a good time, but Lou helped bail a lot of Aggies out of jail.

00:51.541 --> 00:59.029
He provided a lot of dollars and axes and other materials for the bonfire.

00:59.971 --> 01:03.760
He forgot an awful lot of bills that people didn't pay.

01:03.820 --> 01:15.567
Mary Wilson, who worked for me for many years here at the magazine, used to work for Lou when she was a student, and I think even before she became a college student.

01:16.458 --> 01:23.997
She talked about a drawer that was just full of tickets that were unpaid for material that people had bought over there.

01:24.038 --> 01:28.770
And they would always get after Lou and say, Lou, you've got to go try to collect this money.

01:29.111 --> 01:31.176
Oh, they'll come around when they've got it.

01:31.797 --> 01:32.718
Just leave it alone.

01:33.499 --> 01:46.932
And there was kind of a joke back then that Lou's family or his brothers used Lou's store for a tax write-off because he didn't make a lot of money, but I don't know if that was true or not.

01:47.273 --> 01:51.257
I think he was probably pretty successful even when he didn't get everything paid for.

01:52.197 --> 01:57.703
Did you ever know of Lou attempting, Old Army Lou attempting to do anything

01:58.426 --> 01:59.957
that was unethical.

02:00.058 --> 02:03.643
I never heard anything except generosity.

02:03.893 --> 02:20.653
No, he was generous to a fault and if Lou did anything, it was that maybe some people took his actions as encouraging kids to drink and do stuff they shouldn't do, but I don't think that was it at all.

02:20.713 --> 02:26.720
I think he just knew when somebody got in trouble they needed help and he wanted to try to help them.

02:27.381 --> 02:31.065
Earl Rudder, what was he like in your student days?

02:31.197 --> 02:38.587
Of course, I didn't have a whole lot of personal contact with him, but he was kind of a looming image.

02:38.727 --> 02:47.338
I mean, he was a big person in more ways than physical stature, and he spoke at our orientations.

02:47.398 --> 02:56.310
He was the guy who stood up there and told us, look at the man in front of you and the man behind you and the one on your left and the one on your right because they're not going to be here when you finish school.

02:56.763 --> 03:00.369
And there was a lot more truth than that than we wanted to believe at that time.

03:01.270 --> 03:12.949
But he was a powerful presence and I consider him, for his time and for what needed to be done then, one of the best presidents this school's ever had.

03:13.029 --> 03:22.905
I put him in a league with Lawrence Sullivan Ross and I would like to include in groups like that people like Jack Williams.

03:23.543 --> 03:25.587
They were here at a time when they needed to be.

03:26.588 --> 03:37.668
Ross made sure that A&M didn't get turned into an insane asylum or shipped over to Austin and turned it into, you know, a school that could be reckoned with.

03:38.770 --> 03:48.167
Rudder came along at a time when both non-compulsory corps and women were such an important issue and without his

03:48.367 --> 03:53.672
war record background and what he had done in the state land office to gain people's respect there.

03:54.873 --> 03:57.536
I just don't think anybody else could have done what he did.

03:57.576 --> 04:01.880
He caused things to happen.

04:01.940 --> 04:14.813
The story John Lindsay tells about getting approval of the former students for the board to approve limited coeducation is a jewel and it shows the genius of the man because

04:15.299 --> 04:24.674
He knew that he couldn't get that by the board without some sort of endorsement, and he knew that John Lindsay was a person that would help him get what he needed.

04:25.656 --> 04:35.812
A lot of people didn't talk to John Lindsay for a long time after that, but I think most of them came to realize later that what was going on and what happened was good.

04:36.834 --> 04:42.403
But Rutter was a very strong presence, and I think

04:43.480 --> 04:53.971
people looked up to him a great deal and felt like he was somebody that they wanted to be like, or at least wanted to try to achieve the sort of things that he achieved.

04:55.193 --> 05:04.983
And of course I have memories too of the clashes that Tommy DeFrank had with him, which mostly happened after I left.

05:05.444 --> 05:11.530
But he and, I think he and DeFrank were on a collision course before I finished school.

05:12.657 --> 05:22.654
I remember Tommy, who, you know, later became a White House correspondent for Newsweek, Tommy liked to write stories that were critical of the civilian students.

05:22.735 --> 05:27.904
And the civilian students tended to write letters back to the battalion that were critical of Tommy.

05:28.605 --> 05:29.927
And then he'd write another letter.

05:30.168 --> 05:32.151
And that went on for a long time.

05:32.738 --> 05:42.891
It wasn't any surprise to me when I heard a year or two later after I left school that Tommy had been fired by Earl Rudder because Tommy did what Tommy does.

05:43.451 --> 05:46.355
And Earl wasn't gonna pay attention to it.

05:46.395 --> 05:47.637
I guess I shouldn't call him Earl.

05:47.697 --> 05:50.019
I never felt like calling him anything but General.

05:50.620 --> 05:53.003
Do you remember what you students called him?

05:53.924 --> 05:55.166
He was just General Rudder.

05:55.186 --> 05:56.127
He was General Rudder.

05:56.247 --> 05:58.510
That's what I thought, more than President Rudder.

05:58.726 --> 06:11.498
I remember when working as a waiter over in the catering office at the MSC, we had a big banquet one night and, let's see, what was his name?

06:12.119 --> 06:19.225
Ben Daniel, I think, wasn't he the brother of Price Daniel who was the governor of Guam?

06:19.766 --> 06:26.252
He was here at a dinner that night and he left these people that were talking out in the hall at the dinner to come talk to us

06:26.975 --> 06:30.119
over standing around waiting for our time to serve tables.

06:30.960 --> 06:39.572
And I remember earlier coming over to him after a little while and saying, you know, Governor, we need to come on in here.

06:40.393 --> 06:43.577
And he didn't think too much of him spending all the time with us over there.

06:43.597 --> 06:47.042
He didn't think that was where he ought to be.

06:48.727 --> 06:51.511
Let's see, I'm trying to think of other campus.

06:52.993 --> 07:01.844
Were there any, in your student days, do you remember any impressive visitors from off campus who came here?

07:04.328 --> 07:16.624
Well, Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians were here for a show and I remember Ray Anthony and his bookends, the gorgeous brunette and blonde that he had with him, were here.

07:17.330 --> 07:19.153
Oh, who were some of those other shows?

07:19.273 --> 07:23.859
Gosh, I went to as many of those as I could find time or money for.

07:23.879 --> 07:29.968
Gosh, I'm drawing a blank right now.

07:32.352 --> 07:34.655
Popular student indulgences.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.259
What were students smoking then?

07:40.103 --> 07:42.126
Well, they certainly weren't smoking pot.

07:42.226 --> 07:45.210
Most of them were smoking Marlboros, I think.

07:45.477 --> 07:46.939
or some other popular brand.

07:47.139 --> 07:52.244
If you're really tough, you smoke Lucky Strikes without a filter.

07:53.625 --> 07:57.029
Did y'all even know the word marijuana or cocaine?

07:57.389 --> 07:57.589
No.

07:57.930 --> 08:00.472
No, it didn't mean anything to us at that time.

08:01.714 --> 08:06.619
And people were drinking beer, whiskey, and wine?

08:08.080 --> 08:11.704
Pretty much beer for the most part, and occasionally whiskey.

08:12.038 --> 08:17.149
And if it was a mixed drink, it was mixing something into a Coca-Cola or a?

08:17.269 --> 08:19.494
Yeah, very, very plain type drinks.

08:19.534 --> 08:24.725
You didn't have any whiskey sours or fancy drinks to go.

08:24.886 --> 08:27.692
Was Uncle Ed's hard liquor still here?

08:28.113 --> 08:28.714
It was.

08:28.734 --> 08:31.600
I think I went in there one time.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.885
Like I said, I didn't get off campus a whole lot when I was a freshman and sophomore.

08:36.925 --> 08:47.080
But when I was finishing up between 64 and 66, places like Franklin's and the Country Kitchen were real popular.

08:47.801 --> 08:50.224
And we went out there.

08:50.244 --> 08:55.272
I remember on the radio show, Bob used to love to advertise for Franklin's.

08:55.332 --> 09:01.080
And he'd say, you know, I bet these guys would like to go out to Franklin's and get a cup of coffee.

09:01.246 --> 09:06.937
Of course, beer drinking was what went along mostly at Franklin's and good stakes.

09:06.957 --> 09:10.483
Describe a court trip in your undergraduate days.

09:10.984 --> 09:18.057
Okay, my freshman year we went up to TCU and they had banners critical of A&M hanging from their dorms

09:18.593 --> 09:32.546
And there was a sophomore in my outfit whose last name happened to be Cooper also, Johnny Cooper, and he decided he was going to literally scale the side of one of those dormitories and take one of those banners home with him.

09:33.007 --> 09:44.938
Well, he got up there to the second floor level and he pulled the banner down and he got about halfway back down when I guess his grip slipped and he dropped and he broke his ankle or his leg some way.

09:45.374 --> 10:14.352
and uh... he was on crutches the next day to watch us in the march in but uh... we all scrambled into the cars dragging him behind us and took off and one of our sophomores had a uh... garage that they had gone and either borrowed or picked up uh... bunch of used beds and stuff and put in this garage and he put a whole bunch of us up there like eight or ten of us one night

10:14.872 --> 10:17.237
And he didn't tell us about the train.

10:17.879 --> 10:23.110
At 3 o'clock the next morning, a train came through, and that train track was four feet behind the garage.

10:23.732 --> 10:27.059
And we all come running out of there like the whole place was going to fall down.

10:27.119 --> 10:31.429
And he was just standing out there waiting for us and laughing because he knew what was going to happen.

10:31.409 --> 10:35.714
How did y'all get to Fort Worth?

10:35.774 --> 10:37.997
Just hitched rides.

10:38.277 --> 10:39.359
Some people hitchhiked.

10:39.899 --> 10:43.043
Most of us just caught rides with whoever had a car.

10:43.103 --> 10:52.455
They had sign-up sheets for the outfit or just about anywhere else around that you wanted to go, you could find somebody who was going that way.

10:53.144 --> 10:59.253
And usually if you were hitchhiking, you got picked up by another carload of Aggies that was already heading out and had room for one more.

10:59.273 --> 11:04.141
And as you marched, how did the people in Fort Worth respond?

11:04.381 --> 11:08.347
Oh, it was a fun thing because everybody, you know, really received us well.

11:08.447 --> 11:14.697
It was kind of like, hey, you know,

11:15.098 --> 11:17.781
all these people that have been critical about A&M, where are they?

11:17.921 --> 11:30.536
Because obviously the only ones that showed up for a parade were the people who liked A&M, and of course I'm sure a lot of them were families or former Ags, and they just made us feel good.

11:30.556 --> 11:33.699
Did you and your buddies have dates with Tessies?

11:35.181 --> 11:38.625
I'm trying to remember it.

11:39.567 --> 11:42.651
I don't remember if I had a date that year at the game.

11:42.711 --> 11:49.060
The next year I had a date over at the Cotton Bowl with a girl from SMU.

11:50.182 --> 11:58.574
And that was a fun deal because I had failed to be able to get her a ticket to get in the right section for the Corps.

11:59.655 --> 12:08.528
And I don't remember where the Cotton Bowl was built, but at one end there's kind of a sloping grass area that comes down to another walkway.

12:08.626 --> 12:27.053
it was a little bit soft but she took off her high heels and we climbed up to get to the area we needed to get into and of course getting into the section was easy because all you had to do was go in there and get somebody else's date ticket and then come out and get your date and bring her in so we probably had about four times as many people in that section as we're supposed to be there.

12:28.815 --> 12:34.223
And then on Saturday nights on court trips what did y'all do?

12:35.325 --> 12:37.047
Well there was usually a

12:37.263 --> 12:39.848
party or a dance going on.

12:40.530 --> 12:44.277
Sometimes we'd go to that or sometimes just our outfit would have a get together.

12:45.660 --> 12:51.913
We had a deal where, matter of fact, I think one of those pictures in there is me with a date from

12:52.349 --> 13:00.078
TSCW that we had at a party and I don't even remember where that was.

13:00.158 --> 13:05.023
It was out at somebody's place out in the country and we just had a real good time.

13:05.323 --> 13:20.500
Now when the Tessies used to come down here by bus or train in large numbers I've heard stories about the outfit having a pot where everybody put some money in and the guy that got stuck with the worst date

13:20.868 --> 13:22.910
Now that really preceded our time.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.653
We didn't do a whole lot of that back then.

13:25.673 --> 13:33.862
What we did do was we wrote to our post office box mates and shared letters, and I even did that with a girl.

13:34.042 --> 13:44.353
Matter of fact, I've still got some letters in there I was looking at today from a girl in Austin that I wrote over at Scottish Rite Dorm, I think, over there.

13:44.513 --> 13:47.096
I just wrote to the box number at Scottish Rite Dorm.

13:47.657 --> 13:49.879
We corresponded and had a date or two,

13:50.112 --> 13:55.001
She, you know, I was too far away for that to last very long.

13:55.542 --> 14:03.858
My brain tells me that would have been the equivalent of email, internet, dating now.

14:05.802 --> 14:07.024
Let's see.

14:09.687 --> 14:13.995
Describe a typical home football game day.

14:14.677 --> 14:16.059
What time did you all get up?

14:16.179 --> 14:17.682
What time did things happen?

14:18.223 --> 14:21.009
Gosh, you're asking me to really remember a lot of things.

14:22.151 --> 14:32.691
Well, believe it or not, there were some Saturdays of football season that we actually got up and had a drill at about 7.30 or 8 in the morning.

14:32.671 --> 14:38.377
There was even a period while I was here when we had classes on Saturday morning.

14:39.339 --> 14:45.886
And I'm at a loss to try to tell you exactly what the sequence of events went on.

14:46.467 --> 14:54.436
At a certain point in time, we had to be sure we were at the dorm and in uniform for the march in and get ready to go over there.

14:54.756 --> 15:00.923
And then, of course, after the game, it was kind of everybody on their own.

15:01.510 --> 15:09.519
main job was to grab the yellow eaters and go to the fish pond and have yellow practice in front of the Y. All right, now in your day, was there always a march in?

15:10.039 --> 15:12.422
There was always a march in, yeah.

15:12.462 --> 15:18.788
And if you had a date for the home game, when did you separate from her?

15:19.049 --> 15:22.332
Well, usually she took her ticket and went on into the stands.

15:22.933 --> 15:29.560
And you just had to try to pick a spot or see if you could designate an area where she was supposed to be.

15:29.995 --> 15:40.666
And oftentimes there were other students that, you know, may not be in the core or something and they'd often help you make contacts.

15:40.686 --> 15:45.011
And so they were usually waiting in the stands for you after you got finished marching.

15:45.692 --> 15:54.501
Now, do you remember for you or any of your acquaintances any goofily awkward situations at football games with a date or something or other?

15:55.932 --> 16:25.922
well i remember going to texas tech one year and we had dates with tech girls and we quickly found out after a m started scoring they had i think we scored about thirty points that day that these girls all had made a pact that uh... they dated tech boys and that they weren't going to kiss their aggie dates and by the time the evening was over i don't know about the rest of my date was feeling pretty embarrassed about the whole thing and you know that

16:26.493 --> 16:30.598
She felt like I wasn't having that great a time and I probably wasn't.

16:30.618 --> 16:35.944
But what I remember the most after that was we left the stadium and we walked over.

16:35.964 --> 16:40.670
I had to meet a friend of mine at a dorm over there that I was going to stay with.

16:41.471 --> 16:43.673
And we walked through the student center.

16:43.713 --> 16:53.665
And when we walked in that student center, I'm sure I was probably the only person in an A&M cadet uniform in that entire place.

16:54.691 --> 16:56.573
and it just got deathly silence.

16:57.514 --> 17:11.269
And we walked with everybody just staring at us right down the middle of that hall and to the other end and there wasn't, I mean, nothing but whispering going on around the sides.

17:11.289 --> 17:15.474
And I got, I was rather unhappy.

17:15.494 --> 17:24.023
My date did apologize to me and I think I did get one goodbye kiss before she left, but I was so disheartened and all.

17:24.256 --> 17:29.524
probably had a little too much to drink, and I woke up feeling sicker than a dog the next day.

17:32.168 --> 17:34.190
You know, I can remember that like it was yesterday.

17:34.251 --> 17:36.073
That's the awfulest feeling I ever had.

17:36.834 --> 17:45.347
Let's see, talking about games, of all of the games you attended as an undergraduate, what were the high points that you, just enjoyment?

17:45.727 --> 17:47.790
Whether or not we won the game, that's not the question.

17:48.311 --> 17:52.457
What were some fun memories?

17:53.652 --> 18:00.342
Gosh, even trying to remember the games is kinda hard back then because they usually turned out pretty disappointing.

18:01.603 --> 18:09.094
I think the high point of a lot of them was when we got to leave and go back to the dorm or go party or whatever we were gonna do.

18:10.135 --> 18:17.005
I'm trying to remember if there were any really memorable games in that year.

18:17.065 --> 18:18.968
You remember that

18:19.437 --> 18:30.533
They brought Jim Myers in, and they used to say that Jim Myers brought the three yards in a cloud of dust offense, and then they said Hank Fullberg came and did away with the three yards.

18:31.775 --> 18:41.789
We were kissing dates on first downs, and it was even, I think we even did it one game on possessions whenever we could get our hands on the ball.

18:42.069 --> 18:44.412
Or what about in basketball?

18:44.873 --> 18:46.455
Basketball was a fun time.

18:46.576 --> 18:49.039
I remember, I tell you,

18:49.289 --> 19:18.334
watching carol broussard play basketball was a thing of beauty that that guy had a jump shot from outside of the free throw circle that that was just unbelievable and i mean it would just every time it would just go right in the basket and uh... benny lennox i don't think too many people ever see a set shot artist like that in their life i mean he could sit there and just drop them through that net every time he let go of the ball and of course he set the record against wyoming uh...

19:18.618 --> 19:23.287
I don't remember which year it was, but one of those years he had 53 points by himself.

19:24.770 --> 19:28.979
And John Beasley was graceful too.

19:29.780 --> 19:37.015
Carol Broussard, I may be embellishing this, but he would go up for his shot

19:37.383 --> 19:45.392
And to get away from the defender, he was tall already and he would jump up and he would arch back away from the basket.

19:45.412 --> 19:50.398
And I swear sometimes he was almost nearly horizontal to the ground when he'd let go of that ball.

19:50.638 --> 19:57.766
And there was no way the guy could be within eight feet of him because he was so high and he was so far away moving back away from him.

19:57.826 --> 19:59.448
There's no way he could block that shot.

20:00.549 --> 20:05.955
And it seemed that the A&M head coach always had a smile, the basketball coach then.

20:06.475 --> 20:08.237
Shelby grinned a lot.

20:08.417 --> 20:09.839
Oh, he did, yeah.

20:09.939 --> 20:11.881
Shelby grinned like a Cheshire cat.

20:12.302 --> 20:14.324
It was a pleasant... He'd probably say like a coon.

20:14.344 --> 20:16.286
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:17.408 --> 20:21.472
Final, let's see, you were not in the Corps your senior year.

20:21.732 --> 20:32.545
No, after two years, I had, my grades were starting to drop, and that fifth semester I was here would have been my junior year.

20:33.506 --> 20:36.229
I lived over in Leggett Hall, and...

20:36.530 --> 20:41.538
That was the year of the hurricane and all, and I never did catch up with my grades.

20:42.078 --> 20:44.061
That was kind of a fun year for me.

20:44.101 --> 20:51.172
I may have had too much fun, but I felt like I had a whole lot more freedom not being in the Corps.

20:52.133 --> 20:57.201
I'm trying to remember some of the things we did and all.

20:57.261 --> 21:01.828
We had a very tight-knit group over there in Leggett Hall.

21:03.074 --> 21:06.879
Most of us were from the Corps and I think we sort of felt like it carried over.

21:06.959 --> 21:10.283
We were sort of a unit and treated each other that way.

21:10.303 --> 21:15.489
Did you civilian students almost without saying so feel you had something to prove?

21:16.470 --> 21:18.092
Oh yeah.

21:18.112 --> 21:31.849
I think we did and I think we made probably even a better effort to make sure that we were friendly and that we spoke to people on campus and particularly people in the Corps.

21:32.200 --> 21:39.707
and that we tried to remember what it was like for us when we were in there.

21:39.827 --> 21:41.949
Oh, I know an important set of questions.

21:42.790 --> 21:49.676
How diverse was the student body then in terms of the way we now talk about ethnic diversity?

21:51.458 --> 21:56.022
Well, I'll be honest with you.

21:57.384 --> 22:01.127
I'm trying to remember when even our first black football players

22:01.360 --> 22:02.021
came in.

22:02.061 --> 22:06.327
That was probably a little after that time.

22:06.847 --> 22:08.530
But we had Hispanics.

22:09.211 --> 22:09.972
We had Hispanics.

22:10.032 --> 22:12.255
I lived one that year in Leggett.

22:12.315 --> 22:12.855
I had a room.

22:13.296 --> 22:16.420
We had three roommates because we were crowded at that time.

22:16.861 --> 22:18.683
And I had a roommate from Mexico City.

22:19.685 --> 22:25.533
And we got along pretty good except when he and his buddies would gather in my room and talk Spanish.

22:25.653 --> 22:31.080
And I finally put a stop to that and told them that, you know, if they wanted to

22:31.347 --> 22:32.809
to visit in their own language.

22:32.889 --> 22:38.777
I didn't object to it, but I didn't really want them doing it in front of me because I didn't feel comfortable because I didn't know what they were saying.

22:38.817 --> 22:42.702
And they respected that after that.

22:43.042 --> 22:43.743
All right.

22:43.863 --> 22:47.188
How, in general, how were Hispanics, U.S.

22:47.208 --> 22:48.329
Hispanics treated?

22:51.073 --> 22:55.338
Well, I mean, we had guys in our outfit that were Hispanic.

22:55.358 --> 22:59.143
I mean, my roommate my sophomore year was Carlos Vela.

22:59.478 --> 23:01.420
who's a dentist down in Laredo now.

23:01.621 --> 23:03.843
And Carlos and I got along pretty good.

23:03.863 --> 23:08.489
I think the only thing he didn't like was I wasn't as study-oriented as he was.

23:09.110 --> 23:14.717
But as far as the ethnicity or anything, there was no conflict.

23:15.318 --> 23:17.561
What about Jewish kids?

23:17.921 --> 23:20.945
We had some Jewish kids in our outfit that were freshmen with us.

23:25.310 --> 23:28.354
Except for the fact that sometimes they

23:28.705 --> 23:31.948
seemed to have a little trouble with marching and stuff like that.

23:32.228 --> 23:35.070
I mean, again, no problem.

23:35.151 --> 23:37.793
No problem because they were Jewish.

23:37.933 --> 23:40.375
It was problems because of other personality quirks.

23:40.675 --> 23:42.497
Catholic?

23:42.977 --> 23:44.158
I'm sure we had them then.

23:44.218 --> 23:44.719
I don't know.

23:44.739 --> 23:48.282
I couldn't point to any and say they were, but I'm sure there were.

23:49.423 --> 23:55.408
What I'm assuming is that the key thing was, were they Aggies or were they not?

23:56.188 --> 23:56.649
That was it.

23:56.729 --> 23:57.970
We were all Aggies.

23:58.625 --> 24:09.616
Of course they told us that they cut our hair off and all when we were freshmen to eliminate all of these signs that we were something different than somebody else and we wore the same clothes.

24:10.657 --> 24:17.603
It was all done with that purpose in mind and I think for the largest part it was successful.

24:17.623 --> 24:24.750
I think any conflicts came strictly from actions between people and the way

24:24.882 --> 24:32.133
they generally reacted toward one another, and it had nothing to do with any outside or other influences.

24:32.153 --> 24:40.146
Now, in earlier years, there were some nicknames for people by nationalities, national background.

24:40.667 --> 24:42.289
Were any of those still around?

24:43.852 --> 24:50.923
Well, if you mean camel jocks, people from the Middle East, I guess, countries and places like that,

24:51.342 --> 24:52.983
We had terms like that.

24:53.064 --> 24:58.649
I don't think people very often spoke in those terms in front of them.

24:59.569 --> 25:02.292
It was just kind of something they used to refer to them.

25:02.392 --> 25:06.356
And I don't think in most cases anybody meant a whole lot by it.

25:06.376 --> 25:12.801
It's just that there was one other way of recognizing that they were different a little bit.

25:12.821 --> 25:16.365
I have always assumed that it was kind of like the nicknames for the faculty.

25:16.965 --> 25:21.349
It was a kind of a backhanded term of endearment, acceptance.

25:22.139 --> 25:29.547
Again, I think it was more to define a difference that was perceived there than it was to try to really do anything else.

25:29.627 --> 25:37.475
I don't know if it was complimentary or not, but it was certainly not generally intended to be uncomplimentary.

25:38.376 --> 25:49.328
And it's just like the terminology they had in World War II for the Japanese and for the other ethnic origins then.

25:51.333 --> 26:00.527
People fall into these habits, and obviously we've all learned they're bad habits, but back then you didn't think about them in terms of I was trying to run somebody down.

26:01.028 --> 26:06.657
It was just something you said or did, and it was thoughtless, but it wasn't intended maliciously.

26:07.819 --> 26:18.015
By today's definitions, what generally would you have said was the typical student attitude of liberal conservative

26:20.898 --> 26:28.472
Well, we were getting some students then probably that had a little more liberal leanings.

26:28.532 --> 26:36.527
I think the Goldwater-Johnson election in 64 kind of spelled that out because the,

26:36.507 --> 26:57.705
Students were starting to put up a lot of Goldwater banners in their dorms, and the order came down from Earl Rutter's office, who was of course a close friend of Lyndon Johnson's, that there would be no political signs displayed in state buildings, and that included dormitories.

26:58.141 --> 27:01.065
Obviously, everybody kind of knew where that came from.

27:01.125 --> 27:10.978
And I have photographs in my attic of probably one of the few overtly political marches that ever took place at A&M back then.

27:11.118 --> 27:17.447
And it was a protest against Rutter's policy about no dorm signs on the campaign.

27:18.007 --> 27:25.297
And they hung placards around Sully's neck and climbed up on him and made speeches and all.

27:25.377 --> 27:26.899
And there's probably...

27:27.520 --> 27:33.072
two dozen people at the most gathered around there and probably half of those were curious about what was going on.

27:33.613 --> 27:47.301
But I've got color pictures of all that and of course it was led by a good friend of mine, Ron Smith who was a Yankee from New York and he was a journalism student but he

27:47.990 --> 27:57.864
Ron thought different than all of us did anyway, but in this particular case, I think he was probably right, but they didn't make much headway with Rudder.

27:58.505 --> 28:13.947
And as you think of the student body in that era, were they a kind of a sample of this part of Texas, the eastern two-thirds of the state in terms of urban, rural?

28:14.500 --> 28:19.246
Well, there were quite a few from central and west Texas as well as the eastern area.

28:19.266 --> 28:24.933
And we had a fair number of students from other states here then.

28:25.714 --> 28:29.699
Like I said, a number of them that I took journalism with were from out of state.

28:29.959 --> 28:38.370
One besides New York, there was one from, I think, New Jersey and several other places.

28:38.470 --> 28:40.272
But you all weren't all country boys.

28:40.623 --> 28:50.983
No, I think the majority of people probably came from a scattering of not country towns or little places, but small towns.

28:52.346 --> 28:55.873
Texas City, I don't remember how many it had back then.

28:55.893 --> 28:59.560
Texas City probably was 25, 30,000 people or something then.

28:59.978 --> 29:07.633
I think there was not the concentration of people from Houston and Austin areas.

29:07.833 --> 29:16.209
If they had more people, it was probably pretty much in ratio to people from outside of the big cities.

29:16.229 --> 29:20.357
Silver Taps, what was it like for a youngster the first few times?

29:21.219 --> 29:22.020
Pretty impressive.

29:22.473 --> 29:31.003
kind of made you gain an understanding that there was a little bit more to this place than you'd had a chance to see before.

29:31.063 --> 29:36.229
I think that was our first real exposure to what really ties Aggies together.

29:36.269 --> 29:47.822
The fun and the football games and all of that stuff is fine, but until you are at a Silver Taps or until you

29:47.971 --> 30:00.897
sit at a muster and hear what goes on at their, it's just like they say, you know, it's the Aggie spirit, you can't define it for somebody else, and they can't understand it unless they've been there.

30:01.158 --> 30:06.368
And I think the smartest thing we ever did

30:06.820 --> 30:12.508
was to get some people to look at us who had a chance to spread the word.

30:12.628 --> 30:19.078
There was a fellow who wrote sports for the Corpus Christi newspaper back when I first started here with the magazine.

30:19.118 --> 30:27.330
And he happened to be here on a muster weekend for spring training or something and he happened to attend the muster.

30:27.931 --> 30:32.878
And he wrote one of the more meaningful columns which we reprinted in the magazine.

30:33.027 --> 30:40.875
Back then we had musters in front of the system, what used to be the system building and is now the Williams Administration Building.

30:42.016 --> 30:45.860
We had musters in front of the Memorial Student Center.

30:46.741 --> 31:00.115
Those were the only times when anybody walked on the MSC grass and the only time when freshmen and other people could walk on the grass like out at the Administration Building.

31:00.567 --> 31:03.917
I think we had a muster in G. Raleigh White back then as well.

31:04.479 --> 31:09.514
I'd have to go back to the list to see exactly where, but I attended musters
