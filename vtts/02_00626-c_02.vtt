WEBVTT

00:01.938 --> 00:29.937
We started working really off the coast of 
Southern California, and in 1940 we did make a

00:01.938 --> 00:29.937
cruise as far north as roughly the Columbia River, 
and another venture that was in 1939 was a cruise to

00:01.938 --> 00:29.937
the Gulf of California, which we made in the winter 
of that year, which was the first time that any

00:30.541 --> 00:37.387
vessel from Scripps had really ventured very far 
away from home. And this was really sort of

00:38.107 --> 00:44.953
exploring in those days, because so little was 
known.

00:47.675 --> 01:00.126
And I don't know what might have happened if the war 
had not intervened, and I think we would have had to

01:00.933 --> 01:16.808
find some larger vessel and that we would have, 
presumably within a few years at least, moved out

01:00.933 --> 01:16.808
to operations on sort of an ocean-wide scale. 
Actually,

01:17.809 --> 01:29.961
I left scripts in July of 1941, having spent a month 
prior to that at Woods Hole to learn something

01:30.380 --> 01:54.285
about the interpretation of bathy thermograph 
observations in terms of underwater sound

01:30.380 --> 01:54.285
problems. And on July the 1st, I moved down the Navy 
laboratory on Point Loma, not as an employee of the

01:57.447 --> 02:11.575
Navy, but under one of these war research 
programs.

02:13.310 --> 02:25.066
was funded later on by the NDRC, the National 
Defense Research Committee, I think it was

02:13.310 --> 02:25.066
called. And this was a essentially federally 
funded war research program administered

02:25.086 --> 02:33.117
through the University of California. And I 
stated in this program at Point Loma until early in

02:37.103 --> 02:41.307
1946.

02:46.032 --> 03:05.473
By that time, the work had been taken over by the 
Navy itself, but I still continued, as did many of

02:46.032 --> 03:05.473
the others there, to be actually as employed by the 
University of California.

03:05.993 --> 03:14.755
first year or so down there, the work that I was 
engaged in was primarily how you might interpret

03:15.308 --> 03:29.588
various physical conditions in the ocean, 
primarily temperature and salinity and so on, in

03:15.308 --> 03:29.588
terms of the acoustic conditions in the ocean. We 
used to call the echo-ranging problem, and this

03:30.389 --> 03:44.488
gradually gave way to other environmentally 
related problems, but I became more and more

03:30.389 --> 03:44.488
involved in the general sort of administration of 
some of the basic research going on at the

03:45.262 --> 03:55.175
laboratory on Point Loma. And toward the end, I 
actually was an assistant director in charge of

03:56.076 --> 04:12.017
the research, which involved primarily a set of 
acoustics of various kinds, but a good many other

03:56.076 --> 04:12.017
types of activities. I have several questions on 
that. Now, you go to Woods Hole, though, to work

04:14.219 --> 04:18.646
with the BT for anti-submarine warfare, don't 
you? I did go back and work with Robert Montgomery

04:20.348 --> 04:42.842
for about a month, because at that time, as I 
indicated earlier, we really didn't know what the

04:20.348 --> 04:42.842
bathy thermograph was measuring and so on, and 
also how you might be able to use this kind of

04:20.348 --> 04:42.842
information in these underwater sound problems. 
And we were all very naive as to what we were doing,

04:42.923 --> 05:05.235
but I contributed my small part here to the whole 
program in that I was the one who suggested they

04:42.923 --> 05:05.235
make photographic copies, and Montgomery and I 
worked out the first sort of system for coding

05:05.485 --> 05:14.877
these things and keeping the appropriate records 
and so on, which persisted for a good many years

05:05.485 --> 05:14.877
after that. Right. You're looking for ways of 
measuring thermal clamps. In effect, yes. There

05:22.928 --> 05:28.135
had been some work done by Columbus Island at Woods 
Hole by Morris Ewing and some of the other people

05:28.688 --> 05:43.491
that were associated with them in the preceding 
few years. which showed the probable

05:43.876 --> 05:55.735
relationship of temperature and humidity 
conditions on underwater sound. And Morris

05:56.035 --> 06:10.778
Ewing's contribution, I think, was particularly 
to show that you could use some of the refraction

05:56.035 --> 06:10.778
computations that he was familiar with from his 
work in geophysics would be applied to these.

06:11.298 --> 06:22.195
these conditions in the ocean, and of course it was 
not directly temperature and salinity that was

06:11.298 --> 06:22.195
involved here, but the distribution of sound 
velocity. And so there were, we had the clue as to

06:22.215 --> 06:39.482
what we should be doing, although a lot of the sort 
of techniques had not been worked out, and

06:22.215 --> 06:39.482
particularly during the first year or so, much 
effort went into devising ways of calculating

06:39.850 --> 07:04.693
these so-called ray diagrams and seeing how you 
could in a sense simplify some of the conditions as

06:39.850 --> 07:04.693
you observed in the ocean to compute these sort of 
ray diagrams and so on.

07:05.078 --> 07:17.719
Then a lot of effort was spent in the first year or 
two of making up what were called sound ranging

07:05.078 --> 07:17.719
charts or sonar charts, which didn't depend just 
on the BT. We used every other scrap of information

07:17.780 --> 07:26.935
we could to essentially try and come up with

07:27.522 --> 07:38.383
quantitative approach of the regional 
differences in sound ranging conditions that

07:27.522 --> 07:38.383
might be predicted from characteristics of the 
ocean waters. Why photography? I'm sorry? Why

07:40.908 --> 07:41.670
photography? What made you think of photography? 
I guess because my father was a photographer, and

07:44.583 --> 08:05.376
it seemed to me that the BT slide was like a 
negative, and why not put it in a projector and just

07:44.583 --> 08:05.376
make a print from this, which could then be 
enlarged too, because the original BT slide you

07:44.583 --> 08:05.376
really had to insert in a a magnifier in order to 
read it, we more or less standardized on what was

08:06.048 --> 08:16.467
roughly a postcard size reproduction. All you 
have to do is stick them in a regular photographic

08:17.369 --> 08:29.811
enlarging machine and use fairly contrasty 
paper.

08:30.668 --> 08:33.871
When you're working, I need to know something else 
here, too, right now. Why didn't you go with Revell

08:34.211 --> 08:39.196
to the Navy and to Washington at this time? Why did 
you choose Point Loma? Well, here again, there's

08:41.058 --> 08:58.093
some kind of interesting things that, if I 
remember correctly, about 1939, there was some

08:41.058 --> 08:58.093
concern about the international situation and so 
on. Revell uh had applied for and obtained a

09:00.082 --> 09:26.578
reserve commission as an ensign and i applied too i 
think it was somewhat later than that because yes

09:00.082 --> 09:26.578
must be and i have somewhere in my files a letter 
that i received from the navy saying that they

09:00.082 --> 09:26.578
regretted they didn't couldn't offer me a 
commission because they had no foreseeable need

09:26.744 --> 09:33.153
for oceanographers. So, of course, Revelle went 
down to Point Loma at that same time, and I can't

09:33.314 --> 09:46.293
really remember how long he was there, but he was 
there for about a year or two before he went back to

09:33.314 --> 09:46.293
Washington. But I had tried that route, but it 
didn't work. and

09:56.630 --> 10:04.241
I think that answers it, sure. And then during 
those war years, then, you're involved in

10:05.062 --> 10:10.670
research at Point Loma itself. Yes, I would, as I 
look back on it now, I did a good deal of

10:10.690 --> 10:25.911
research, particularly in the first year or two, 
but really what I became more and more involved in

10:26.549 --> 10:31.735
was what I would consider a science 
administration. And things moved very rapidly in

10:32.476 --> 10:54.261
those days, and so there was a great deal of sort of 
planning and a good deal of traveling involved in

10:32.476 --> 10:54.261
that under the NDRC, where there were several 
centers, work of this kind was going on, and they

10:54.848 --> 11:18.460
served as a sort of coordinating function, and so 
we met at what seemed like fairly frequent

10:54.848 --> 11:18.460
intervals for discussions of what we were doing, 
what we were finding, what we ought to do, and also

10:54.848 --> 11:18.460
in trying to prepare sort of manuals and documents 
of various kinds for the Navy. So this is part of

11:19.132 --> 11:27.791
what I consider is the administrative side. I 
wasn't involved too much with actual sort of

11:29.374 --> 11:37.933
budgeting or matters of that kind. What it didn't 
involve was us breaking out from the rather narrow

11:38.082 --> 12:00.982
kind of confines of individual research and 
getting involved with the programs and

11:38.082 --> 12:00.982
activities of a variety, a relatively large 
number of people in fields that I had absolutely no

11:38.082 --> 12:00.982
familiarity with at all. And this, I think, was one 
of the effects of the war that it that those of us who

12:06.820 --> 12:32.035
were involved in activities of this kind really 
got broken away from what would have been a normal

12:06.820 --> 12:32.035
sort of pattern of

12:06.820 --> 12:32.035
career evolution here, and got thrust into very 
large, very complex kind of problems involving

12:06.820 --> 12:32.035
fields which were Originally, at least, 
unfamiliar to us. That anticipates, as a matter of

12:37.615 --> 12:39.677
fact, my next question. With whom did you come into 
contact in about 1941 to 1943 that sort of moves you

12:39.717 --> 12:46.583
into administrative oceanography here all at 
once? Well, Professor Sverdrup was originally

12:46.603 --> 13:01.937
to essentially head up the kind of oceanographic 
component at the Point Loma Laboratory. But he

13:02.643 --> 13:21.647
encountered security problems because of having 
his family, not his immediate family, but

13:02.643 --> 13:21.647
relatives in Norway and so on, and it was felt that 
he was in a sensitive sort of position.

13:22.319 --> 13:49.575
they would not give him security clearance, and I 
essentially had to take over what he might have

13:22.319 --> 13:49.575
done, and he returned, and he never really left it 
because this was only a part-time sort of activity

13:22.319 --> 13:49.575
down in Point Loma, but he returned full-time to 
Scripps, and he and Walter Monk, whom we had

13:50.011 --> 13:59.543
originally had down at Point Loma with us, and who 
could not get security clearance. Frederick Monk

14:01.084 --> 14:16.423
took on this study of the wave problem, and I think 
it started originally under the Air Force

14:01.084 --> 14:16.423
support, and out of that there's this whole an 
amazingly rapid development of understanding of

14:17.028 --> 14:34.491
the problems of wave characteristics, wind wave 
characteristics, and methods of predicting wind

14:17.028 --> 14:34.491
wave conditions and swell and surf and so on. And 
then out of that activity came the training

14:35.733 --> 14:44.925
program which was sent set up at Scripps, which I 
had no direct contact at all, although I was living

14:45.091 --> 15:04.718
within a few miles of it, which brought in a number 
of young officers from the Air Force and the Navy

14:45.091 --> 15:04.718
who were trained in these wave forecasting 
techniques. And as we were saying this morning,

15:05.479 --> 15:14.912
later on, a number of these young men returned to 
Scripps and finished off their doctoral work But

15:15.803 --> 15:39.798
that was really one of the, I think, very dramatic 
developments during the war, because prior to the

15:15.803 --> 15:39.798
time that Sverdrup and Munk turned their 
attention to this problem, which they had not

15:15.803 --> 15:39.798
really dealt with previously, there was 
virtually nothing known about the

15:15.803 --> 15:39.798
characteristics of ocean waves. It was a body of 
theory. very little connection between the sort

15:43.343 --> 15:54.533
of theory and the real conditions, and there was 
only a very, very limited literature about wave

15:43.343 --> 15:54.533
conditions and wave behavior.

15:58.196 --> 16:04.342
Did you consciously make an effort at about 45 to go 
to Washington or to D.C., or did that just happen?

16:04.362 --> 16:13.350
Well, here again, I think that Ravel enters the 
story because he had moved from the Navy

16:14.427 --> 16:44.113
Laboratories Point Loma to the Bureau of Ships, 
and in particular to the, I think it was called the

16:14.427 --> 16:44.113
Sonar Design Section or something, that name, 
under a, can't remember his rank now, but Bennett,

16:14.427 --> 16:44.113
and had the imagination to see the role of and 
importance of ocean information to the Navy, and

16:44.363 --> 17:01.666
yet there was no mechanism by which the Navy could 
essentially continue the oceanographic studies

16:44.363 --> 17:01.666
and so on. There are a number of sort of related 
threads to the story which are involved in this

17:13.017 --> 17:28.392
thing, and that is that, as I mentioned earlier, at 
Woods Hole and at Point Loma we prepared, for

17:13.017 --> 17:28.392
example, these sonar charts and so on. They were 
actually published through the Hydrographic

17:29.073 --> 17:41.826
Office, and so that during the war they had set up in 
the Hydrographic Office an oceanographic unit, I

17:42.447 --> 18:03.291
believe it was called at that time, and this was 
under the direction of Mary Sears, who was being

17:42.447 --> 18:03.291
commissioned as a wave, and they served during the 
war as a, as essentially a publications outlet for

18:03.912 --> 18:27.777
for some of the material being prepared under 
these war research laboratory programs, and they

18:03.912 --> 18:27.777
did some compilation of various kinds of 
information, but this was a temporary sort of

18:03.912 --> 18:27.777
situation, and one of the things that Revelle and 
others were able to accomplish was to have the Navy

18:28.077 --> 18:49.410
Department set up on a more, on a continuing basis, 
the an oceanographic section in what was then the

18:28.077 --> 18:49.410
Hydrographic Office, and I was essentially 
offered the position, and it looked extremely

18:49.762 --> 19:07.511
interesting and important to me at that time to go 
back and start what was known when I arrived as the

18:49.762 --> 19:07.511
Division of Oceanography in the Hydrographic 
Office. Of course, the whole thing later became

19:07.531 --> 19:15.043
the Oceanographic Office, but it was a division. 
Shortly

19:15.698 --> 19:40.812
after I arrived in April of 1946, the

19:15.698 --> 19:40.812
oceanographic unit that had been in existence was 
being phased out, and the new division reached a

19:15.698 --> 19:40.812
low ebb of one girl who helped me and myself. I left 
about five years later with over 200 people in the

19:45.603 --> 20:00.117
division and operating two sort of what were at 
that time very large oceanographic vessels for

19:45.603 --> 20:00.117
the Hydrographic Office. So this was a, yes, a 
challenging sort of thing. I felt that there were

20:06.374 --> 20:19.613
urgent needs for, to keep a sort of a national 
program going rather than letting things die as

20:06.374 --> 20:19.613
they might have at the end of the war. And

20:20.354 --> 20:29.547
I think this was turned out to be quite correct. 
What sort of people did you look for when you went to

20:32.695 --> 20:35.838
establish this office? Did you already have some 
people in mind whom you wished to bring to

20:35.858 --> 20:39.702
Washington? Well, only a few people that I'd known 
for one reason or another and seemed desirable and

20:39.722 --> 20:55.996
seemed appropriate for the job. And the people 
that really were brought in as to be my principal

21:00.779 --> 21:15.379
assistants were Clifford Barnes, who you'll 
probably talk to next week. but he only spent a

21:16.017 --> 21:21.044
relatively short time with us and then returned to 
the University of Washington. John Lyman, who you

21:22.446 --> 21:33.702
may have encountered, who had been in the Navy all 
during the war as a reserve officer and had been at

21:22.446 --> 21:33.702
Scripps before that. Thomas Austin, who is now 
head of the National Data Center, and another

21:44.131 --> 21:54.146
young man who had been at the WAVE program at 
Scripps during the war, Charles Bates, who's now

21:44.131 --> 21:54.146
chief scientist for the Coast Guard. So those were 
the, in a sense, senior people who came in early in

21:54.166 --> 22:08.248
the game, but what was,

22:11.350 --> 22:22.268
I think interesting looking back that far, which 
is just over 30 years ago, that at that time there

22:11.350 --> 22:22.268
was no classification in the civil service for 
anybody called an oceanographer. So one of my

22:22.328 --> 22:33.747
first sort of jobs back there was to set up the job 
descriptions for oceanographers, get them

22:22.328 --> 22:33.747
approved by the the Civil Service Commission and 
then began to try and recruit some people. And I

22:39.952 --> 22:43.918
very soon found that there weren't very many 
people to be recruited. And as any administrator,

22:45.099 --> 23:00.662
I abhor as a job vacancy why we were in the position 
of having to hire people with degrees in physics or

22:45.099 --> 23:00.662
chemistry or geology and so on. with essentially 
no experience whatsoever in oceanographic

23:01.283 --> 23:07.169
problems. And I soon realized, as I'd learned 
during the war, that there was a real need for some

23:07.270 --> 23:18.582
kind of program to train people or educate people 
in the field. And so, as I sometimes remark, I

23:19.663 --> 23:30.295
decided to get out of the hiring business and get 
into the manufacturing business. to come to the

23:30.967 --> 23:35.393
University of Washington looked attractive to 
me. Not only was it sort of intellectually

23:35.453 --> 23:42.541
attractive, but I thought there was a very real 
sort of need here. Now, there was some graduate

23:42.562 --> 23:54.156
programs available in the early years following 
the war, but One of the things that really

23:54.929 --> 24:07.337
stimulated me into coming to the University of 
Washington was the opportunity to set up an

23:54.929 --> 24:07.337
undergraduate program in oceanography, which 
had never been attempted before. You know, I want

24:08.138 --> 24:09.782
to return

24:13.222 --> 24:18.729
I have several questions, though, right here 
concerning your activities in D.C. itself rather

24:13.222 --> 24:18.729
than Washington State. Was there much conflict 
between these civilian oceanographers and Navy

24:19.891 --> 24:25.618
personnel when you began to establish this 
office? Well, I wouldn't say there was any

24:25.638 --> 24:29.544
conflict. We were looked on as screwballs by the 
establishment within the Hydrographic Office.

24:36.833 --> 24:40.979
They didn't know quite what we were or who we were or 
anything else. And... So we were allowed really a

24:42.770 --> 24:57.153
considerable amount of sort of freedom simply 
because they had no prior experience in this area.

24:58.074 --> 25:09.773
And this

24:58.074 --> 25:09.773
period, and I can't identify it specifically by 
year, but the military budgets were being cut back

25:10.242 --> 25:28.302
very severely in the late 40s, and along with them 
the Hydrographic Office was being cut back by

25:10.242 --> 25:28.302
major

25:10.242 --> 25:28.302
amounts, and yet the oceanographic program 
continued to grow. This, of course, was looked on

25:31.894 --> 25:48.914
with some sort of favor and encouragement here, 
but I think they realized that there was something

25:31.894 --> 25:48.914
to be done here. Now, the people who are sort of 
particularly important

25:56.564 --> 26:15.771
encouraging and supporting the growth of the 
Oceanographic Program were not so much within the

25:56.564 --> 26:15.771
office itself, but in the Office of the Chief of 
Naval Operations, people concerned with

25:56.564 --> 26:15.771
anti-submarine warfare and pro-submarine 
warfare and so on, the operating forces. And it was

26:16.772 --> 26:20.698
largely through their interest that we got the 
support and opportunities we did. What about ONR?

26:29.308 --> 26:33.535
Well, ONR, I have to stop and think here again. That 
got started when, about 46? 46. It was not really

26:37.360 --> 26:42.428
called ONR then, but Revell begins to think about 
ONR in 46. Yes, it was the Office of, what was it

26:42.488 --> 26:46.033
called? Something rather off, OR? Something and 
Inventions. Yeah, right, it's a strange title.

26:52.383 --> 27:09.231
Yes, and it must have got established about that 
time, and Revelle then moved from the

26:52.383 --> 27:09.231
Bureau of Ships to the newly established Of 
course, the establishment of ONR was, in a sense, a

27:09.903 --> 27:37.243
response to the phasing out of the wartime

27:09.903 --> 27:37.243
research activities under NDRC and the parent 
organization, which was OSRD, Office of

27:09.903 --> 27:37.243
Scientific Research and Development, I guess it 
was. So the Navy was, in a sense, trying to find some

27:37.612 --> 27:44.342
mechanism to keep some of their programs going. We 
worked very sort of closely together, although I

27:46.646 --> 28:01.088
cannot remember that there were ever any sort of 
transfer of funds or anything, as one might have

27:46.646 --> 28:01.088
anticipated in more recent times. But I actually 
spent almost a year of it. It must have been about

28:05.595 --> 28:10.479
1949, 50. I spent the better part of a year actually 
in ONR on loan, in a sense, from the Hydrographic

28:10.659 --> 28:31.378
Office to work on planning and so forth as related 
to anti-submarine problems. And so there was a

28:31.578 --> 28:37.464
good, I think, there was no conflict there. Now you 
ran into some sort of difficulties that you'd

28:39.646 --> 28:50.838
almost anticipate anywhere. But I had really very 
good rapport, I think, with the people in the

28:50.858 --> 29:00.268
hydrographic offices. CNO and ONR and Bureau of 
Ships and so on. So, no, I don't feel there was any

29:08.268 --> 29:17.342
antagonism.

29:17.522 --> 29:26.796
Certainly there was a difference in perspectives 
on a lot of the problems. I went back to Washington

29:27.333 --> 29:50.893
with the idea that we ought to be doing a lot of work 
on the Arctic, and this had seemed to me a good sort

29:27.333 --> 29:50.893
of subject in which we knew very little and that we 
ought to be doing some work up there, and here's

29:27.333 --> 29:50.893
where we got into

29:51.852 --> 30:19.210
lack of appreciation on the part of the 
particularly CNO, who informed me and my boss, the

29:51.852 --> 30:19.210
hydrographer, in no uncertain terms that the Navy 
had no plans to operate in the Arctic and therefore

29:51.852 --> 30:19.210
had no reason to want to spend any money trying to 
find out about it. One of the things I was able to do,

30:19.797 --> 30:35.292
in part with assistance from ONR and some others, 
was to, in effect, bootleg some, get some work

30:19.797 --> 30:35.292
started in the Arctic.
