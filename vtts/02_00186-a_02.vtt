WEBVTT

00:02.647 --> 00:06.172
I'm the office secretary, so it didn't bother me.

00:07.914 --> 00:14.783
And then I got an office of my own.

00:16.225 --> 00:18.027
Gosh, it must have been a year, two years later.

00:19.189 --> 00:20.511
We were on the second floor then.

00:21.692 --> 00:25.077
And then the dean's office was moved over to the new area.

00:26.358 --> 00:27.540
And we moved in that area.

00:29.073 --> 00:31.196
I'm trying to remember.

00:31.216 --> 00:33.961
There used to be a museum on the first floor.

00:35.102 --> 00:35.443
Okay.

00:36.445 --> 00:42.875
Dean's office down where, Dean's office, down where microbiology is now, the old building.

00:43.295 --> 00:45.118
This building here was where we are now.

00:46.440 --> 00:46.921
This was here.

00:46.961 --> 00:48.203
This was part of Smallville Clinic.

00:49.265 --> 00:49.645
Is that right?

00:50.006 --> 00:50.607
No, I'll take it back.

00:50.627 --> 00:52.009
This was not here.

00:51.989 --> 00:58.459
On the other side of the elevator, that was a small clinic and this building was not here in the 60s where we are now.

00:59.721 --> 01:18.672
Of the various responsibilities, the various departments and so forth, which the facilities in veterinary medicine then were best for what area and worst for what?

01:23.883 --> 01:28.069
No, the best was probably the Suamble Clinic for receiving cases, I think.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.333
That would be my first reaction.

01:31.755 --> 01:36.622
Pathology, the necropsy lab was probably the best other than that at that time.

01:37.223 --> 01:45.475
Was there any that the typical veterinary medicine faculty member thought was kind of the favorite area?

01:46.156 --> 01:48.540
Not unless it was the clinic area, no.

01:50.832 --> 01:57.661
And how did you and your wife, how were you all received?

01:57.681 --> 02:00.385
Were there any social activities then?

02:00.545 --> 02:08.757
Yeah, particularly the three of us, the Kimbers and the Ramgies, we were kind of, we got along well together.

02:10.199 --> 02:14.865
Some of the others were a little bit slow because they already had their own, you know, groups.

02:15.605 --> 02:29.225
Dr. Jaggi was very nice to us, but his wife was, she was afraid of the dark so we didn't go out at night and afraid of storms and clouds, so she had some hang-ups, so we didn't get together then very often, so.

02:29.246 --> 02:32.250
Was there any all-faculty social event?

02:32.370 --> 02:33.031
No, not like that.

02:33.051 --> 02:33.612
Nothing like that?

02:33.632 --> 02:35.275
No, yeah.

02:35.295 --> 02:37.498
But did the students have any social events then?

02:37.939 --> 02:44.228
Yeah, they used to have a barbecue at the end of the year and probably at the beginning of the year.

02:44.208 --> 02:48.834
And that got kind of wild, so they had to cut that out after a while.

02:48.874 --> 02:50.636
Describe it as you remember it.

02:50.817 --> 02:58.406
As I remember it, barbecue, they had barbecued chicken and generally, and sometimes beef.

02:58.426 --> 03:03.913
It was generally held at the, oh gosh, it used to be on Highway 21 East.

03:05.335 --> 03:09.200
An old white building, a meeting hall sometime.

03:09.381 --> 03:10.502
Remember that?

03:12.406 --> 03:14.508
I can't remember if it's not there anymore, Haskell.

03:15.349 --> 03:16.651
I want to say K.C.

03:16.671 --> 03:18.833
Hall, Knights of Columbus Hall, something like that.

03:19.473 --> 03:20.495
I remember we used to meet there.

03:20.535 --> 03:21.496
It was pretty run down then.

03:22.317 --> 03:29.144
But they'd have loud music and a lot of beer and a lot of barbecue.

03:29.965 --> 03:33.468
And sometimes it got a little bit rambunctious, start throwing chicken at each other and things like that.

03:33.508 --> 03:34.289
We left pretty soon.

03:34.389 --> 03:36.051
We'd go for about an hour.

03:36.111 --> 03:37.873
Did the students have dates?

03:38.225 --> 03:40.287
Not, not very often, no.

03:40.868 --> 03:41.549
And they cooked it?

03:41.929 --> 03:42.510
Yeah, they cooked it.

03:42.570 --> 03:43.190
Yeah, they cooked it.

03:43.731 --> 03:52.520
Sometimes it was pigs and pork from the, they apparently got them out from the, from the, they said necrops, but I'm sure they had some hogs they were raising from the clinic.

03:52.541 --> 03:56.665
They often got an animal, you know, donated at the clinic and they would barbecue that.

03:56.685 --> 04:03.152
I just remember they, they were pretty rambunctious, but we'd go to them and leave early.

04:03.132 --> 04:06.540
Now, how did you and your family become part of the community?

04:07.543 --> 04:09.247
Through the church, yeah.

04:09.267 --> 04:09.929
Describe that.

04:10.731 --> 04:13.457
Well, we joined the church as soon as they came here.

04:15.462 --> 04:20.314
Why that church?

04:20.294 --> 04:23.997
It was kind of an alternating affair.

04:24.258 --> 04:28.441
We, we, Martha was Presbyterian and I was Methodist.

04:28.581 --> 04:30.884
And when we first got married, we went to the Methodist Church.

04:32.085 --> 04:34.287
We went, first we moved to Higgsville, Missouri.

04:34.587 --> 04:35.748
We went to Presbyterian Church.

04:36.449 --> 04:41.273
Our next time we went to Methodist, it was time to go to the Presbyterian kind of agreement.

04:41.293 --> 04:50.301
But also some, a couple of the elders called on us in our home there on the Franklin Avenue and invited us to the church.

04:50.281 --> 04:50.902
And we went.

04:51.302 --> 04:53.044
How did they know you were Presbyterian?

04:53.104 --> 04:53.785
Did you all visit?

04:53.885 --> 04:54.986
I think we visited, yeah.

04:55.087 --> 04:55.187
Okay.

04:55.207 --> 04:56.408
Yeah, Martha will remember all the details.

04:56.428 --> 04:57.489
She'll tell you who was there.

04:57.509 --> 05:01.554
And I want to say Mickey was one of them.

05:01.574 --> 05:02.195
Mickey McGuire?

05:02.215 --> 05:03.236
Mickey McGuire, yeah.

05:03.256 --> 05:03.556
Uh-huh.

05:03.576 --> 05:09.763
And I think Doc Dunham, no, uh, McNeil Drumwright.

05:09.923 --> 05:12.847
I'm pretty sure those two came by and visited with us.

05:14.369 --> 05:16.491
And, of course, Dick Thomas was there.

05:17.011 --> 05:22.463
How long did it take you all before you decided that was a history?

05:22.664 --> 05:24.047
We didn't consider any other church.

05:24.067 --> 05:27.615
We just started going there, so that's one way we went to.

05:27.756 --> 05:32.406
And then did you all get involved in any other community activities?

05:32.426 --> 05:36.235
I got involved for a while in the Lions Club, Morning Lions Club.

05:36.687 --> 05:44.538
But I had so many classes, particularly 8 o'clock, that you got too much of a hassle going to 7 o'clock meeting and leaving.

05:45.619 --> 05:49.164
Now, and the youngsters weren't, they weren't school age when you all got here, were they?

05:49.184 --> 05:50.767
No, they were not, no, no, no.

05:50.787 --> 05:52.809
So you had a chance to get started?

05:52.829 --> 05:53.270
Right, right.

05:54.752 --> 05:55.834
At home and so forth.

05:55.854 --> 05:55.974
Right.

05:55.994 --> 06:01.321
Did you have any problems adjusting to Bryan, to Texas, to this climate?

06:01.341 --> 06:02.523
Oh, a little bit to climate, yes.

06:02.763 --> 06:03.384
Yeah.

06:03.444 --> 06:04.626
I mentioned school a while ago.

06:04.766 --> 06:06.188
We had no air conditioning in this building.

06:06.168 --> 06:10.000
And I can still remember, I think it was here three years before we got a window unit.

06:10.702 --> 06:14.374
So you'd depend on fans and open windows, and it got pretty doggone hot.

06:14.655 --> 06:16.701
And we also, we didn't have an air-conditioned car, so.

06:17.390 --> 06:18.672
It made a difference.

06:18.972 --> 06:21.155
And you didn't have air conditioner at home, did you, at first?

06:21.175 --> 06:22.597
No, not at first we didn't.

06:22.878 --> 06:27.003
But when you go shopping or go to a store, it seemed like you were going to freeze to death.

06:27.985 --> 06:32.812
It was amazing, the difference in air conditioning.

06:32.832 --> 06:36.497
So from that standpoint, the weather was, you know, I still remember being very hot.

06:36.557 --> 06:40.923
And after we were here four or five years, I bought a new car and bought it without air conditioning.

06:40.943 --> 06:41.924
I thought I was going to get killed.

06:43.547 --> 06:46.671
But anyway, at that time, they weren't too popular.

06:46.651 --> 06:52.019
What was it like to become an Aggie?

06:53.201 --> 06:59.931
How long did you get involved in any of the campus activities?

06:59.951 --> 07:01.574
Did you go to football games, basketball?

07:01.594 --> 07:03.597
Yeah, we went to football games.

07:03.577 --> 07:06.341
And a little bit of basketball games, right.

07:06.361 --> 07:07.282
Football and basketball.

07:07.302 --> 07:07.843
Went to those.

07:08.023 --> 07:11.949
What were your impression of the Aggie traditions?

07:11.969 --> 07:13.771
Well, it was very impressive, yeah.

07:13.791 --> 07:17.496
Yeah, they're different.

07:17.516 --> 07:21.922
Staying up throughout the game was when he got on the other side of the field from the, on the.

07:21.942 --> 07:26.168
And the, the band and all that.

07:26.188 --> 07:26.429
Oh, yeah.

07:26.549 --> 07:26.949
And Ravelin.

07:26.969 --> 07:29.773
Watch the Corps march in, yeah.

07:29.793 --> 07:30.394
Yeah.

07:30.374 --> 07:45.509
As far as athletic events, the thing I remember most vividly is my younger son and I liked to go watch Randy Mattson when he was, and we were sitting down to the north end of the Oval there when he broke the world record.

07:45.609 --> 07:46.710
Boy, I still remember that.

07:48.351 --> 07:51.835
April 22nd, 1963.

07:52.816 --> 07:53.436
You were there?

07:54.357 --> 07:56.179
I think, or is it 67?

07:56.513 --> 07:58.155
I think 67, I think.

07:58.175 --> 07:58.415
67.

07:58.435 --> 07:59.496
No, no, I still remember that.

07:59.696 --> 08:04.902
This is an editorial note.

08:05.642 --> 08:18.015
I had talked to Randy Monday before that to tell him that I was invited to give the muster speech in Waco on Friday night, the 21st.

08:18.075 --> 08:24.141
They had called and said, bring your whole family, we'll put you up for the

08:24.121 --> 08:25.735
for Friday and Saturday nights.

08:25.756 --> 08:27.955
You can have a wild Waco weekend.

08:29.234 --> 08:30.976
Which I thought was kind of a tease.

08:32.158 --> 08:42.792
Then I had learned that Randy was going to throw the shot on Saturday the 22nd for the last time at Kyle Field wearing an Aggie uniform.

08:43.854 --> 08:58.313
I had met Randy the day he came to visit as a prospective recruit and I was very much a track fan and knew who he was and I was very, very, very deeply impressed with him as a person then and still am.

08:58.293 --> 09:06.747
So, when I saw him that Monday before the 22nd, I said, okay, Randy, I'm canceling the Waco Saturday night.

09:07.268 --> 09:11.054
Going to come back early Friday morning, Saturday morning.

09:11.515 --> 09:14.239
Will you make it worth my while?

09:14.259 --> 09:17.685
He very seriously said, I'll do my best, sir.

09:17.665 --> 09:22.670
He broke the record, I believe, on his first throw and I was so impressed.

09:22.770 --> 09:29.617
And the next Monday I ran into him again at MSC and I said, Randy, how in the world did you do that?

09:29.757 --> 09:31.119
How could you accomplish that?

09:32.620 --> 09:45.293
He said, well, I lay awake a good number of nights trying to figure out how could I show people here how grateful I was for all of the thoughtfulness they had given to me.

09:45.273 --> 09:48.819
And he said, I'm not very good at making speeches like some of you guys.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.794
I can't put words together that well.

09:51.331 --> 09:56.516
And then I decided maybe the best way for me to show my appreciation was to use my right arm.

09:57.757 --> 10:01.500
I told him that was far more eloquent than the rest of us than it should ever be.

10:02.521 --> 10:05.183
End of note.

10:08.006 --> 10:18.655
So you found it comparatively pleasant to become a part of the campus and the community around the campus.

10:18.675 --> 10:19.836
Yes, sure.

10:19.816 --> 10:23.983
All right, let's move forward then.

10:24.044 --> 10:35.404
As the vet school, what was your first new responsibility after those first two courses?

10:35.985 --> 10:38.269
To develop one in epidemiology and I did, yes.

10:38.850 --> 10:41.234
And that would be for what level?

10:41.415 --> 10:43.258
That was for third year?

10:46.040 --> 10:48.523
I think we started out the third year, yes.

10:48.724 --> 10:50.586
I mean, we eventually moved it to first year.

10:51.307 --> 10:52.289
Describe that course.

10:52.789 --> 10:58.077
That course was very difficult to teach, but it was a fun course, fun course.

10:58.117 --> 10:58.517
It was new.

10:59.619 --> 11:00.420
What made it difficult?

11:01.121 --> 11:05.186
Well, there's no textbook for it as far as that level.

11:06.849 --> 11:15.000
There was, you have to use a lot of problems, stuff like that to try to get the point across, so you have to develop those.

11:14.980 --> 11:23.053
It used to matter, it took a while to develop material which I thought would be integrated with the, the such material.

11:23.193 --> 11:26.539
So that's, that's basically it, basically it.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.164
And it included what species of animals?

11:30.185 --> 11:30.785
It's all of them.

11:30.806 --> 11:42.304
Epidemiologists, it applies to any animals, but I tried to make it apply to specific diseases that they knew about, because the third year they'd already had many of these diseases, because Dr. Jag is teaching, for example, canine distemper,

11:42.284 --> 11:49.857
There's a part of the disease of dogs, canine to simply be one of horses, different things like that.

11:49.897 --> 11:52.221
So it, from my standpoint, it worked out pretty good.

11:52.702 --> 11:57.069
Did you start with any specie of animal at the first of the semester?

11:57.109 --> 11:58.892
No, no, no.

11:58.872 --> 12:15.651
I just used start principles and, well, I did start, the example was one species of human because the classic John Snow cholera outbreak in London in 1855 was the way to start, so.

12:15.671 --> 12:17.134
What did you use as your model?

12:18.835 --> 12:19.356
A model.

12:19.817 --> 12:23.384
Yeah, did, was there some, was this course taught somewhere else?

12:23.624 --> 12:26.049
No, no, as far as I know it was the first time it had been taught.

12:26.089 --> 12:31.860
I used some, model derived from material I'd had at Tulane where I worked and got my masters in public health.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.544
Did you propose the course or did?

12:34.265 --> 12:35.848
No, they felt like they needed one.

12:36.368 --> 12:40.815
when I came here, and I told them, well, I'll develop one, so that's the way it ended.

12:41.175 --> 12:43.599
What did the students think about it when they first had it?

12:44.901 --> 12:46.684
They didn't want it, I don't think.

12:46.704 --> 12:47.485
Oh, they took it.

12:47.565 --> 12:51.271
I mean, at that time, students, you know, they weren't very rebellious.

12:51.391 --> 12:55.798
They were very receptive, and as far as I know, they took it okay.

12:55.938 --> 12:57.921
Did it get a nickname or a reputation?

12:57.941 --> 13:00.906
It may have, but I didn't learn it.

13:02.609 --> 13:04.772
What did they think about its difficulty?

13:04.752 --> 13:08.557
Probably concepts, you know, the concept of how disease is transmitted.

13:08.577 --> 13:12.282
And I tried to make it vivid for them as vivid as I could, give them examples.

13:13.404 --> 13:15.586
And it was lecture and lab?

13:16.127 --> 13:16.748
No, just lecture.

13:17.048 --> 13:17.389
Lecture?

13:17.409 --> 13:17.829
Yeah, yeah.

13:18.691 --> 13:19.952
What, did it replace any?

13:20.393 --> 13:22.396
No, it was a new course, new course.

13:22.416 --> 13:22.836
Entirely?

13:23.397 --> 13:23.537
Mm-hmm.

13:23.557 --> 13:26.641
All right, so then this is your third or fourth year.

13:28.263 --> 13:28.404
Mm-hmm.

13:28.424 --> 13:30.286
And you were teaching that every?

13:30.587 --> 13:31.147
Every year, yeah.

13:31.348 --> 13:31.768
Every year.

13:31.908 --> 13:33.190
And then what about the other two?

13:33.777 --> 13:37.504
Uh, I didn't have anything in the first two years, you know.

13:37.524 --> 13:37.945
I mean not.

13:38.306 --> 13:41.092
But we had the third year every year, so I was teaching that year around.

13:43.276 --> 13:45.380
And then we went to the trimester soon after that.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.645
That was, that was another experience.

13:47.825 --> 13:51.432
Describe, describe the trimester.

13:51.412 --> 13:57.863
Trimester you went from two regular semesters of 16 weeks, 17 weeks to three 15 week semesters.

14:00.046 --> 14:08.140
This way the students would take, well it's supposed to have been three years but actually a little bit more than three years because they're going year around what it amounts to.

14:08.240 --> 14:12.327
So they graduate a year earlier or nine months earlier what it amounts to.

14:12.848 --> 14:16.474
They graduate August, anyway.

14:16.454 --> 14:23.233
It's very concentrated, we have to give all exams at 7 o'clock in the morning and classes start at 8.

14:24.517 --> 14:31.155
Now this started in the early 60's, soon after I came here, I have to stop and think.

14:33.987 --> 14:36.389
I'm trying to think, Haskell, yeah.

14:36.409 --> 14:42.555
Because I would have to go out and I was doing my research then, so I was doing some work on horses.

14:42.615 --> 14:46.238
I had to go out and bleed the horses before 7 o'clock.

14:47.219 --> 14:51.443
If I had an exam, I'd probably get up at 5 o'clock and go out and bleed the horses every morning.

14:51.703 --> 14:53.845
They'd do this for a year, just every day.

14:53.885 --> 14:58.290
Then you'd come back and teach the students.

14:58.310 --> 15:02.053
And if you had an exam, which exams are always 7 o'clock.

15:02.033 --> 15:07.441
Students weren't very receptive to that, but they were anxious to get out nine months early, so it worked that way.

15:07.461 --> 15:09.724
Where did the idea for the trimester come from?

15:09.824 --> 15:10.285
Al Price.

15:10.926 --> 15:11.206
Is that right?

15:11.226 --> 15:12.789
Yeah, well, he's one implemented.

15:12.889 --> 15:13.490
He's one pushed.

15:13.510 --> 15:15.693
It was really developed by Armstead.

15:16.314 --> 15:26.168
Armstead was dean here before Al Price, and he went to Michigan State and developed it there, and Al Price liked it, so we took from there.

15:26.148 --> 15:29.578
The idea was you'd turn out more veterinarians by just having three years.

15:29.598 --> 15:32.246
Well, you do it one time and then you're in sequence again.

15:32.266 --> 15:34.432
So you gain one graduating class.

15:36.499 --> 15:38.705
And this lasted about how long?

15:39.267 --> 15:40.731
It lasted about...

15:42.736 --> 15:44.298
I want to say 15 years, I think.

15:44.459 --> 15:45.200
That's quite a while.

15:45.661 --> 15:47.684
And then it was eventually terminated.

15:47.704 --> 15:48.285
It was terminated.

15:48.866 --> 15:49.707
And they phased out.

15:49.747 --> 15:58.361
They gave the students a choice whether they wanted to continue after they got in the first year, if they wanted to continue on the trimester or go to a four-year system.

15:58.381 --> 16:00.404
So they let them choose.

16:00.424 --> 16:03.429
They came down half the class wanted to have the summers off.

16:03.449 --> 16:06.313
The other half wanted to get out of here.

16:06.293 --> 16:09.179
What would, if the faculty had voted, what would they have voted?

16:09.299 --> 16:11.123
They'd vote to get rid of it.

16:11.143 --> 16:11.945
That's what I had thought.

16:12.025 --> 16:12.546
Yeah, yeah.

16:12.566 --> 16:16.334
Because the theory was you'd teach two, you'd be off one, but it never worked out the way.

16:16.354 --> 16:17.837
You were always a class.

16:18.118 --> 16:23.188
Well, like my, my, pardon, I was the only one to teach in those courses, so year-round, year-round, so.

16:24.046 --> 16:26.150
Now, you mentioned research.

16:26.210 --> 16:27.713
When did you begin your research?

16:28.193 --> 16:32.962
I began my research about a year after I came here, yeah.

16:32.982 --> 16:36.729
And what was your first area of specialization?

16:36.809 --> 16:38.492
My first area was pathology.

16:38.512 --> 16:40.175
I was a pathology graduate student.

16:40.856 --> 16:45.304
At that time, the funds for pathology research were real, all stirred right up.

16:45.465 --> 16:46.807
And Charlie Bridges, I forgot about him.

16:46.867 --> 16:48.450
He was another department head.

16:48.430 --> 16:52.657
And he kept suggesting things that I didn't really want to work on.

16:52.677 --> 16:56.003
They weren't very in my interest.

16:56.163 --> 17:04.458
I finished all my coursework and Leland Grumbles approached me and said they had some, they got a research grant on equine infectious anemia, viral disease of horses.

17:04.498 --> 17:06.341
Would I be willing to do my research on that?

17:06.722 --> 17:07.523
He was on my committee.

17:08.705 --> 17:11.991
Dr. Bridges was chair of it.

17:11.971 --> 17:17.617
And to make a long story short, I switched my degree program over to majoring in microbiology.

17:22.562 --> 17:24.484
In fact, they just created a Ph.D.

17:24.524 --> 17:25.545
in veterinary microbiology.

17:28.208 --> 17:31.512
And so I did my research on that for the magnitude.

17:31.532 --> 17:32.313
So I kind of switched.

17:33.113 --> 17:36.737
After I did my coursework, I switched degree majors in midstream.

17:36.757 --> 17:40.341
But it worked out okay because I had to do a lot of pathology on the horses.

17:40.895 --> 17:43.524
Now we're working on your Ph.D.

17:43.684 --> 17:44.025
Right.

17:44.727 --> 17:47.677
When you came here, did you have that as one of your goals?

17:48.058 --> 17:50.145
Yes, it was, yeah.

17:50.969 --> 18:06.386
If I'm back up, when we went to Iowa State, they offered me a position up there, and after talking over with Martha, after we got back to Kansas City, we said no, and I informed them, they said, well, would you consider applying for NIH fellowship and come here as a full-time graduate student?

18:06.507 --> 18:15.977
And that particular time, I had a Dr. Mortar, who was head of their research station, or whatever you call it, at Iowa State University for Veterinary School.

18:16.758 --> 18:20.082
So I said, yes, I wrote up a research proposal,

18:20.905 --> 18:23.389
applied to the NIs of H and

18:24.365 --> 18:28.789
And that's the last I heard of it until after I came down to A&M and wasn't here two weeks.

18:28.829 --> 18:36.256
I got a notification I'd been awarded my NIH Fellowship full time to Iowa State.

18:36.296 --> 18:38.818
So I had another decision to make.

18:38.838 --> 18:40.179
And so we decided to stay here.

18:40.199 --> 18:44.003
I felt kind of bad at being here a few, you know, weeks and leaving, so.

18:45.084 --> 18:54.372
But anyway, I came here with the intention of staying three or four years, getting my, get a degree, and then so I could go on because my interviews

18:54.352 --> 19:00.145
Iowa State and of course here and contact Oklahoma State that obviously you need to go for a PhD.

19:01.268 --> 19:05.377
And if I wanted to stay in academia and I felt like well maybe that's what I wanted to do.

19:05.538 --> 19:11.010
Anyway, I was pretty well decided I was going to do that when I came and we talked about that so you can do your research here.

19:10.990 --> 19:15.999
To do it, I'd have to take off one summer or more to go full time as a graduate student.

19:16.019 --> 19:17.541
I did that too, one summer, so.

19:17.581 --> 19:23.952
So, again, what was the, what was the, the dissertation problem?

19:24.493 --> 19:30.784
It was, the dissertation problem was the, the serological diagnosis of equine infectious anemia in horses.

19:31.585 --> 19:33.509
All right, now put that in layman's words.

19:33.529 --> 19:36.694
Okay, it was developed a method to, to,

19:36.674 --> 19:58.159
developed a blood test where you could tell if a horse was in fact infected with the virus of equine infection anemia, because this is very easily transmitted by blood, just like say hepatitis A in people, or B, by blood, by mosquitoes maybe, various ways, and a very devastating disease in horses because there's no recovery from them, they just gradually go down.

19:58.139 --> 20:01.985
But also there were carrier horses that could carry the virus just like HIV.

20:02.846 --> 20:03.407
Show no sign.

20:04.048 --> 20:10.577
So the thing was they wanted to develop a test and the second phase was after I got through was to develop a vaccine.

20:11.338 --> 20:13.461
This is a retrovirus just like the HIV virus.

20:13.481 --> 20:15.304
So a vaccine has never been developed.

20:15.284 --> 20:21.276
But I did develop, did work on a precipitant test and I had two approaches.

20:21.777 --> 20:28.371
One was serological, what they call liquid precipitant test where you take the serum of the horse and a serum from the test animals.

20:28.391 --> 20:33.040
I used rabbits to develop the reagent.

20:33.020 --> 20:42.340
And the other was to do it in an auger gel system where you put the serum in the auger gel from the horse and you already have the antigen in the auger gel.

20:42.962 --> 20:51.721
First they will develop the liquid procedure and then we'll go to the auger gel and you can do both of them.

20:51.982 --> 20:53.104
That's an intention.

20:53.084 --> 21:00.836
I did the serological serum type and started on the gel type and they wanted to publish everything so let's just quit there.

21:02.559 --> 21:16.982
I mention this because a fellow came through by that time and he was on his way back from Africa to Cornell and he'd been working on a similar disease in horses in Africa.

21:16.962 --> 21:22.771
Anyway, he developed the so-called perceptive gel test, and that's the standard test used today.

21:23.512 --> 21:29.822
So we developed the techniques that he used to develop his, so it's known by his name too, so.

21:29.842 --> 21:33.648
And how long did it take you to do this degree?

21:34.349 --> 21:39.797
It took me, I got the degree in January of 95, so it took,

21:41.161 --> 21:43.064
It took, well, it took five years, really.

21:43.084 --> 21:43.866
Wait, you said 95.

21:44.106 --> 21:44.707
I mean, 65.

21:44.727 --> 21:46.490
Yeah, it felt like 95.

21:46.510 --> 21:46.911
65, 65.

21:47.051 --> 21:48.153
I think 65.

21:48.193 --> 21:49.315
Where is it?

21:49.335 --> 21:50.316
Somewhere up here.

21:50.336 --> 21:50.937
65.

21:53.261 --> 21:54.684
And Dr. Bridges was your chairman.

21:55.024 --> 21:57.448
He was my chairman until I switched departments.

21:58.149 --> 21:59.031
But he remained on the committee.

21:59.071 --> 22:00.754
He remained the same committee.

22:00.814 --> 22:03.338
I had Dr. Milleff, Dr. Bridges, and Dr. Moore on the committee.

22:03.318 --> 22:11.330
What were, do you remember any tough obstacles you ran into?

22:11.350 --> 22:12.872
Oh yeah, all kinds of obstacles.

22:12.972 --> 22:25.771
Using some of the test equipment, I've been using it in pathology and there was one piece of equipment up there that no one was using, so I remember one of the faculty members up there in pathology said, well keep using it.

22:25.811 --> 22:27.974
I started using it and Dr. Bridges didn't like that.

22:28.795 --> 22:31.519
Since I wasn't majoring there anymore, you shouldn't be using it.

22:31.499 --> 22:33.502
He gave me a few obstacles.

22:33.842 --> 22:35.485
He made it kind of tough, which is fine.

22:36.025 --> 22:40.111
But it's funny, after I got through, he said, you know you've got a degree in pathology rather than microbiology.

22:40.131 --> 22:40.432
Thanks.

22:42.415 --> 22:50.066
And all of the time and effort that you put in on this was in addition to your full-time duties.

22:50.086 --> 22:50.586
Oh, yeah.

22:50.606 --> 22:51.207
Oh, yeah, definitely.

22:51.388 --> 22:51.628
Oh, yeah.

22:52.169 --> 22:55.093
So normally, where were those hours?

22:55.313 --> 22:56.595
Those hours before?

22:56.575 --> 22:58.417
and late at night.

22:59.338 --> 23:09.852
I spent a lot of time listening to Kelmecs and KRLD at night, listening to the music programs while working in the lab.

23:09.892 --> 23:12.014
In the mornings I go out and play the horses about 5 o'clock.

23:12.295 --> 23:14.498
How many horses were in your... Fifteen horses, yeah.

23:14.518 --> 23:15.158
And they were where?

23:15.739 --> 23:17.161
They were out here at the research farm.

23:17.642 --> 23:18.983
Okay.

23:19.003 --> 23:25.992
And where, and this one I ask naively, where do research animals like that, how are those acquired?

23:25.972 --> 23:36.824
Those are acquired, those are all purchased and they were all purchased, all except ones purchased from West Texas or where the disease is not occurring because they had very few mosquitoes.

23:38.245 --> 23:40.908
All right, so you bought animals that did not have it?

23:41.489 --> 23:41.589
Yeah.

23:41.609 --> 23:42.349
And deliberately?

23:42.870 --> 23:43.831
Deliberately infected them.

23:43.851 --> 23:44.432
Infected them.

23:44.452 --> 23:49.397
And I had one horse, a big stud that was infected, chronic care, and I used him as my source.

23:49.377 --> 23:50.319
Okay.

23:50.780 --> 23:51.281
Yeah.

23:51.301 --> 23:56.732
And these are unbroken horses because when you start handling them, start bleeding them, some of them would turn upside down.

23:56.772 --> 23:59.097
I mean, it really got the, got Harriet time.

23:59.117 --> 24:01.181
How did you pacify them enough to?

24:01.762 --> 24:06.993
You just, you have to just, you put a twitch on them, on their nose and kind of hold them that way.

24:07.013 --> 24:09.799
I had one veterinary student working with me.

24:10.488 --> 24:15.793
In fact, he was in practice in, oh gosh, in Virginia.

24:16.193 --> 24:19.196
I've run into him two or three times, David Borman.

24:19.276 --> 24:20.357
Front row, I'm with Virginia.

24:20.737 --> 24:31.887
And he reminds me every now and then about the, all the circuits we went through leading those horses because some of them just had never, you know, been around a person as far as touching them and jab them with a needle and bleed them out.

24:32.527 --> 24:35.390
Now your routine was to bleed them how often?

24:35.410 --> 24:35.750
Every day.

24:36.030 --> 24:36.410
Every day.

24:36.431 --> 24:39.313
You know, you had to bleed them, temperature them and make,

24:39.293 --> 24:41.437
or their observations, clinical observations.

24:42.539 --> 24:45.485
You know, examine their eyes and whatever, you see if there's any changes.

24:46.306 --> 24:53.300
Did you ever get to a point where you were afraid that there was going to be a dead end street and wasn't going to work at all?

24:53.500 --> 24:54.542
Yeah, many times.

24:55.203 --> 24:59.732
About once a month you run into that.

24:59.712 --> 25:10.449
And as you look back now, to whom do you feel most grateful for their role in the success of that?

25:10.469 --> 25:16.539
Probably Richard or Wayne Moore probably because he's my advisor, major advisor when I, for the research advisor.

25:16.759 --> 25:18.081
And he kept encouraging me.

25:18.422 --> 25:18.863
Yeah, sure did.

25:19.203 --> 25:21.487
And you published the results in what journals?

25:21.747 --> 25:25.433
Well, we, I submitted my results.

25:25.413 --> 25:32.672
to the American Journal of Veterinary Research and it was accepted but they had two other papers they wanted to publish and

25:34.222 --> 25:45.099
I don't know if I should mention this or not, but Richard Wayne wanted to have a journal of Southwestern Veterinary, which was published by the school here, devoted entirely to equine infectious anemia.

25:45.961 --> 25:51.169
So they asked me if I could pull my article out of the American Journal of Veterinary Research and put it in there.

25:51.249 --> 25:53.693
So maybe foolishly, I did that.

25:53.813 --> 25:57.058
So they had an entire journal on that disease.

25:57.078 --> 25:58.120
So that's where it was published.

25:58.268 --> 26:01.194
Were those your first publications?

26:01.294 --> 26:04.181
Yes, yes, yeah.

26:04.221 --> 26:07.468
And when you walked across the stage and received that degree, how'd you feel?

26:07.488 --> 26:08.149
I felt real good.

26:09.793 --> 26:11.356
That is, you say that's 65?

26:11.917 --> 26:12.879
January 65, yeah.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.202
Still a member, yeah.

26:14.367 --> 26:21.977
All right, now that was then a period of change on this campus because women were getting admitted and integration was beginning.

26:23.359 --> 26:24.000
Right.

26:24.020 --> 26:32.411
Please describe what happened in your classes or in the vet school in general about the admission of women.

26:32.771 --> 26:39.160
Well, first of all, I can still remember going to our annual faculty meeting in Guyon Hall.

26:40.381 --> 26:43.125
I can still remember.

26:43.645 --> 26:45.648
Ed McMurray, if you remember him, he was assistant dean.

26:46.088 --> 26:50.614
He questioned President Rudder about what about co-ed dormitories.

26:51.175 --> 26:53.898
And Dr. or President Rudder didn't like that.

26:54.639 --> 27:02.910
And he read in the Ride Act and I can still remember saying something about highway six runs both ways and you remember that too.

27:02.930 --> 27:05.874
I can still remember that and I thought well they're never going to have co-eds there after that.

27:05.974 --> 27:10.480
But of course he had other things in mind but he was just trying to slow down I guess the dormitory ability.

27:11.581 --> 27:13.163
I can still remember our first veterinary student.

27:14.307 --> 27:17.671
Sonia Lee Oliphant from Poteet, Texas.

27:18.272 --> 27:19.874
How was her, how did you spell her last name?

27:20.074 --> 27:23.298
O-L-I-P-H-A-N-T.

27:23.318 --> 27:23.418
Yeah.

27:23.478 --> 27:25.401
O-L-I-P-H-A-N-T.

27:25.501 --> 27:27.103
O-L-I-P-H-A-N-T.

27:27.123 --> 27:28.084
Yeah, I remember her.

27:28.885 --> 27:34.332
And she was, broke the ice and she was kind of a celebrity, what have you.

27:34.352 --> 27:35.514
But it didn't change things much.

27:35.994 --> 27:39.859
Then they started to have more girls in classes.

27:40.143 --> 27:42.189
It sure changed a lot of the lecture material.

27:43.211 --> 27:48.285
As far as you observed, how was she treated by faculty and?

27:48.506 --> 27:50.170
I think she was treated fairly, fairly well.

27:50.912 --> 27:52.637
In lecture class, I could see no difference.

27:52.657 --> 27:56.447
Now, I didn't, I wasn't out in the clinic, so I don't know how she, how she was treated out there.

27:56.427 --> 28:01.558
And from Poteet, so was she from a farming or ranching family?

28:01.638 --> 28:03.342
I think so, yeah.

28:03.362 --> 28:06.309
That's a strawberry area, but I think she was from a farming or ranching family.

28:06.329 --> 28:11.500
And there was no question about her true interest in veterinary medicine.

28:11.682 --> 28:12.183
Not really.

28:12.343 --> 28:13.626
I don't think so.

28:13.646 --> 28:18.857
And you didn't hear anything about her getting any special pluses or minuses?

28:18.877 --> 28:19.137
No.

28:19.297 --> 28:21.462
She was one of the students.

28:21.482 --> 28:24.328
Did you hear of any jokes that any students ever tried to play on her?

28:25.370 --> 28:25.570
No.

28:26.793 --> 28:27.474
I don't remember.

28:27.494 --> 28:27.915
I don't remember.

28:27.935 --> 28:28.817
It's funny.

28:28.837 --> 28:29.217
I don't remember.

28:29.238 --> 28:32.965
I remember some of the others later on they played jokes on them, but I don't remember.

28:32.945 --> 28:40.215
Now, can you share, I've heard that some of the people had to modify some of their lecture examples.

28:40.235 --> 28:40.475
They did.

28:40.495 --> 28:40.675
They did.

28:40.695 --> 28:42.057
Can you think of any examples?

28:42.077 --> 28:45.221
No, I, I, they had to, first of all, they had to change their jokes.

28:47.024 --> 28:50.068
And some of the, well, I can think of examples.

28:50.088 --> 28:56.396
Some of the lectures I'd set in on occasionally, you know, to get the students' attention, they'd throw up a naked woman on the slide every now and then.

28:56.416 --> 28:57.277
Well, they had to stop that.

28:58.359 --> 29:02.344
But most of all, the jokes and the language had to change.

29:02.847 --> 29:11.039
By that time we got, we had the curriculum revision and we had two master's courses, two big courses.

29:11.119 --> 29:13.583
One was a fourteen hour lecture course.

29:13.603 --> 29:18.831
This was all infectious diseases taught in one course except the viral diseases were taught the next semester.

29:18.851 --> 29:30.508
We had a four hour, five hour course but this fourteen hour course had one instructor from each department and it was taught team wise and I was, of course, representing epidemiology as well as public health.

29:30.910 --> 29:32.753
As far as large animal medicine, we had Jim Denton.

29:32.773 --> 29:33.854
I don't know if you remember him or not.

29:33.875 --> 29:41.566
He passed away, but he was known as a hard-boiled old professor, but he was really a, he was really, really a good guy.

29:42.688 --> 29:44.891
With the pathology, we had several pathologists involved.

29:46.434 --> 29:53.084
The first one was Trevino, Gilford Trevino, who was in the Army Air Force, came back here and lectured for a while.

29:56.008 --> 29:58.572
Marcovologist, I'm trying to remember who we had.

30:02.264 --> 30:05.009
Maybe it was Charlie Hall who was doing the microbiology.

30:05.710 --> 30:10.800
Anyway, you could see how they changed their lectures because all of a sudden they had to start changing them.

30:12.282 --> 30:16.510
It was funny just watching how they had to watch their language.

30:16.979 --> 30:19.201
It was really traumatic for some of them.

30:19.221 --> 30:21.143
They'd get out of the lecture hall and they'd cuss like mad.

30:22.985 --> 30:33.997
But it was really a... During those years, where did the typical veterinary medicine faculty members gather to have coffee or whatever to talk about what was going on?

30:34.017 --> 30:34.818
Generally around the offices.

30:34.858 --> 30:36.640
We had no place, common place.

30:38.041 --> 30:42.146
Did you have a group of close friends in those years that you... Not really, no.

30:42.166 --> 30:44.488
We didn't have any place we had to drink coffee.

30:44.468 --> 30:51.979
The only coffee drinking I saw, my office was over where the old museum used to be.

30:52.479 --> 30:56.645
Dr. Jaggi's office was next door to mine and Dr. Patterson, who was an extension veterinarian, was over there.

30:57.166 --> 31:00.931
And occasionally they'd get in one of those three offices and talk and tell jokes, stuff like that.

31:00.951 --> 31:02.514
But that was very small groups.

31:03.074 --> 31:07.260
Now the clinics may have had places, but we didn't have any real place we could meet.

31:07.461 --> 31:11.927
What was your opinion privately about coeducation?

31:13.898 --> 31:15.641
I had no reaction one way there.

31:15.761 --> 31:16.783
I thought it was coming.

31:17.183 --> 31:25.898
I was concerned with more of a curiosity of what's going to happen to the Corps with the coeducational.

31:28.122 --> 31:33.230
But when they decided to start building dorms, I thought, well, they'll probably go.

31:33.250 --> 31:34.472
But I had no concern.
