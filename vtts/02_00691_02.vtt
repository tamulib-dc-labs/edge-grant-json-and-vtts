WEBVTT

00:02.478 --> 00:06.383
time as they can because it gives them more time to 
become qualified. Now, when I came in, I brought

00:07.984 --> 00:21.040
two years of experience with me, so I had a shorter 
time to make tenure, but I also brought articles

00:07.984 --> 00:21.040
I'd published and I had shared and I had some of 
those experiences, so I didn't figure I needed as

00:07.984 --> 00:21.040
much time.

00:24.964 --> 00:31.032
What, as department head, did you have to 
determine salary increases and all that for your

00:24.964 --> 00:31.032
faculty? Yes. Do you have a set criteria, like all 
of the other departments, as to what people have to

00:31.621 --> 00:41.295
do to get tenure or to get promotion or to get the 
merit? It's all merit. Is it all merit? Now, the

00:43.559 --> 00:52.272
tenure and promotion guidelines our department 
has just established, the faculty, we have a

00:43.559 --> 00:52.272
faculty committee of both tenure and untenured 
faculty worked on that. They've set those. As far

00:54.615 --> 00:56.338
as merit, we're working on that. But I say we're 
working because when Ed Tech came in and we had to

00:58.060 --> 01:01.425
start all over again. Because the guidelines we 
had with adult ed faculty I felt may or may not be

01:02.536 --> 01:08.963
appropriate. So we're letting all faculty have 
input into this. But these are guidelines that the

01:12.908 --> 01:14.890
faculty agreed to. And we don't have points. We 
don't say you've got to have so many publications

01:19.476 --> 01:22.399
or anything like that. But we do have guidelines 
within which these increases.

01:30.599 --> 01:35.443
I believe that every faculty member deserves some 
kind of a, at least a minimum raise.

01:38.306 --> 01:39.747
From then on, then it becomes a merit. Now, the dean 
appropriates each department with an X amount of

01:40.868 --> 01:44.592
dollars. There's a number of dollars. And it 
varies from department to department. I assume,

01:48.936 --> 01:49.436
yes. And then within that, you allocate that as you 
see fit. But overall, the College of Education

02:00.215 --> 02:04.800
faculty's salaries are not comparable to other 
colleges? I don't think so. No, I've never got the

02:06.001 --> 02:07.683
book out and looked at it. But I had a faculty member 
do it two or three years ago. He said we've got the

02:11.227 --> 02:14.451
lowest paid faculty. And position by position, 
our assistant professors and associate and fulls

02:14.531 --> 02:20.958
are lower paid than most other colleges. I think 
even liberal arts, I think we're lower. What about

02:25.523 --> 02:29.648
when I hear from a couple of women that I've 
interviewed that The women are not given enough

02:30.303 --> 02:35.631
opportunities in the College of Education for 
leadership. For example, I think in the whole

02:35.731 --> 02:40.838
university, there's only one department head 
that's a female. Do you get any pressure in the

02:41.178 --> 02:47.487
College of Education to hire more women or 
minorities or any of that? Is there? We get strong

02:49.030 --> 02:51.513
suggestions to hire minorities. But of our five 
faculty in adult ed, three are female. So I don't

02:58.783 --> 02:59.905
have any problem there. Although I think the 
majority of our students are going to be female in

03:00.442 --> 03:06.289
the future if they aren't already, which I think is 
appropriate. In Ed Tech, we only have one female

03:07.550 --> 03:11.535
faculty member because none apply. We did offer a 
job last year to a female faculty member in Ed Tech,

03:11.935 --> 03:17.502
and she turned us down. There wasn't enough money. 
That's all the money we had. And as far as

03:21.567 --> 03:28.255
leadership, I can assure you that none of the 
females in our department have won any

03:21.567 --> 03:28.255
leadership. I've offered them leadership. And 
they always say, no, we don't want it. And one of

03:33.243 --> 03:38.008
them has a favorite saying, I'm not after 
anybody's job, so I enjoy my work.

03:41.512 --> 03:47.818
I think one of them would be a good leader, but she 
just won't even consider it. Are you willing to

03:48.238 --> 03:55.886
share the restructuring of EdTech coming into 
your department? How did that come about? All I

03:57.728 --> 03:59.710
know is the dean asked me to... design a plan for 
that happening. Nobody in our department asked

04:03.322 --> 04:07.629
for it to happen, and we're not disappointed that 
it happened. They're good faculty. But you'll

04:09.833 --> 04:12.277
have to ask the dean. They're very autonomous, 
though. I mean, it's pretty sad. They're kind of

04:14.941 --> 04:18.466
doing a totally different... They have their 
graduate study program. They have a master's

04:20.309 --> 04:23.895
degree program, and they offer undergraduate 
courses to the college. There's a coordinator,

04:24.596 --> 04:26.980
and... They determine their own degree plans. And 
they're very autonomous because there are

04:29.463 --> 04:36.471
certain things we do departmentally that we all do 
together. But I know nothing about that area. And

04:39.295 --> 04:42.098
those faculty make their own decisions. Do you 
feel in the college that there is a great deal of

04:42.499 --> 04:45.923
autonomy? For example, you as department head 
don't go around checking on your faculty where

04:45.963 --> 04:53.612
they are or what time or whether they're in classes 
or what their classes are doing. Is it pretty once?

04:56.153 --> 05:02.161
For example, how much autonomy do you have as a 
department head versus you or your faculty? I

05:04.144 --> 05:06.227
think as a college, we're very autonomous. I don't 
check on people unless I start getting

05:07.989 --> 05:10.112
complaints. Then I start following up on it. 
Otherwise, I don't worry about where my faculty

05:12.135 --> 05:14.178
are. And then the dean doesn't actually dictate or 
specify or give you very, very set things to

05:14.258 --> 05:22.349
follow? Not very often. You pretty much can... can 
do what you feel is necessary. As long as we stay

05:26.330 --> 05:30.156
within the policies and procedures of the 
university. Can you just tell me a couple or

05:30.436 --> 05:38.748
describe or something, elaborate or enlighten me 
about a policy committee meeting? What exactly is

05:38.828 --> 05:44.275
it and what happens in these policy committee 
meetings? They vary.

05:48.060 --> 05:49.903
We usually under... Under most conditions, we get 
a report as to what happened at the academic

05:50.474 --> 06:01.049
policies committees for the deans and deans of the 
colleges to give some idea of what's happening

05:50.474 --> 06:01.049
university-wide. We get, I would say, soundings 
on problems that are university-wide that might

06:02.070 --> 06:07.998
affect the college. If there's a decision to make 
on something that we have to do as a college, the

06:09.240 --> 06:16.971
dean usually asks the department how they want to 
go about doing it and what would be the best thing

06:09.240 --> 06:16.971
for us.

06:19.870 --> 06:28.001
Dean's staff usually has some things to share with 
us on things that are going on, reports that are

06:19.870 --> 06:28.001
due, data that are due in, a lot of this kind of 
thing. Sometimes we get into some very

06:29.603 --> 06:34.129
philosophic discussions about what the college 
ought to do. There's never consensus, but there

06:34.169 --> 06:48.207
are disagreements, but they're usually followed 
up in a professional way, and everybody

06:34.169 --> 06:48.207
understands you can disagree and not worry about 
it. But sometimes the dean suggests something,

06:49.688 --> 07:01.905
and occasionally, even though the department 
heads want it another way, the dean will say, I

06:49.688 --> 07:01.905
think this is what's in the best interest of the 
college, and here's the way it's going to be. I have

07:01.925 --> 07:09.436
heard that department heads are not given an 
opportunity to meet apart from the dean's staff.

07:10.357 --> 07:12.179
If you wanted to, could you, or have you ever? It's 
interesting. About three years ago, I started a

07:12.700 --> 07:17.066
luncheon meeting of all department heads in the 
college. I called one. set it up invited everybody

07:18.848 --> 07:45.244
came we had lunch and we sat around and talked for 
about an hour everybody agreed we ought to do it

07:18.848 --> 07:45.244
again and i said okay it's somebody else's turn to 
set it up and we've never met since i refuse to set

07:18.848 --> 07:45.244
them up all the time but you can if you want to know 
there's no policy just in fact uh this last year uh

07:18.848 --> 07:45.244
dr phillips dean of faculty met with all 
department heads in groups of about seven or eight

07:45.713 --> 07:49.599
from different colleges over lunch and had some 
excellent discussions. And I understand there's

07:50.019 --> 07:53.665
supposed to be a department heads council 
developed. What do you think about the faculty

07:54.506 --> 07:59.954
senate and what has evolved out of that? I think 
it's a good thing. I don't agree with all their

08:01.957 --> 08:04.381
decisions, but I think it's a good thing. And I 
think faculty ought to have input. Did that come

08:07.826 --> 08:10.349
from the president? Was that initiated by the 
president? The president supported it. It came

08:13.173 --> 08:14.235
from some faculty. got together and initiated. 
OK, the last thing I'm going to ask you is about the

08:16.681 --> 08:23.809
Development Council, because you have been 
actively involved with the Development Council

08:16.681 --> 08:23.809
since the beginning. Tell me a little bit about 
where you think it's going or what your

08:23.849 --> 08:29.415
perceptions are. There's a little bit of change in 
focus. For a long time, it was all of the department

08:31.877 --> 08:37.363
heads lining up and getting up and giving a report 
and sitting down. And now the focus is kind of

08:37.383 --> 08:39.966
changing a little bit. And we're trying to get more 
work out Development Council. But I'm hearing

08:45.586 --> 08:50.073
that the Development Council doesn't have 
direction as to where they're going to go. It

08:50.093 --> 08:52.237
started out as it was just going to be advisory. Now 
it's because of the challenge of the provost that

08:52.718 --> 09:00.790
this last Development Council joined the faculty 
meeting of the 150,000. There's a more thrust to

09:00.891 --> 09:05.578
fundraising. How do you feel about all of that? 
Well, I think the Development Council ought to be a

09:07.982 --> 09:11.948
working council. We need your advice, 
definitely, but I think you ought to be working.

09:16.197 --> 09:29.232
Fundraising may be part of it, recruiting,

09:16.197 --> 09:29.232
possibly identifying programs or places where 
the faculty or departments can become involved in

09:16.197 --> 09:29.232
that kind of thing. I also believe that for years, 
the council really didn't accomplish too much.

09:37.402 --> 09:38.483
But I don't think it's the council's fault. I don't 
think they were given much to do. And if there's

09:40.818 --> 09:45.064
going to be a change of direction now with specific 
things they can work on, I think it'll be good. As

09:47.468 --> 09:51.814
far as department heads' reports, I don't think 
the department heads wanted to give them, nor I

09:47.468 --> 09:51.814
don't think the council wanted to hear them.

09:54.979 --> 09:56.361
I got that feeling from everybody. So I think the 
council would be better off meeting and working.

10:01.007 --> 10:04.232
If they need a department head or two, call them in 
and ask them, talk to them. But don't have all these

10:05.173 --> 10:09.660
people sitting around and... Now that they're... 
Breaking into committees, your interest on adult

10:09.893 --> 10:16.283
literacy is one of the areas that they want to work 
in. Do you perceive being able to work for things

10:16.684 --> 10:21.191
that the council will be able to help you with? I 
hope so, but I wasn't at the last meeting because of

10:21.271 --> 10:27.761
a conflict, and I don't know what happened and 
haven't been given any report yet, so I'm still

10:21.271 --> 10:27.761
waiting for that. Okay. Well, Dr. Seaman, I want to 
thank you for sharing so many insights, and I

10:31.607 --> 10:35.893
appreciate your input. And if you have any... 
documents or things that you run across that would

10:38.530 --> 10:47.485
give me some extra ideas or some things to verify 
what I've been getting, I would appreciate it. And

10:47.505 --> 10:54.116
if I have some questions down the road after I start 
trying to put it all together, I hope you'll let me

10:47.505 --> 10:54.116
come back and ask you a couple of more questions. 
You know my telephone number.
