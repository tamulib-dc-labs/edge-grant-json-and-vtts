WEBVTT

00:03.524 --> 00:06.108
The project houses, yes. They were on the south 
side of the campus and they were large buildings

00:06.589 --> 00:19.449
and usually, I don't know how many youngsters, 
probably 10 or 12. And usually it was a county

00:21.092 --> 00:31.388
operation and sometimes a widow parent would 
come, a mother usually, a woman. and do the cooking

00:32.144 --> 00:38.794
and the kids brought canned stuff from home and so 
forth and so on. They all seemed to have done well.

00:41.517 --> 00:47.185
The ones I knew personally, of course my roommate 
was from blackest land and whitest people,

00:41.517 --> 00:47.185
Greenville. Greenville. And had a close friend 
over there we used to visit. But I never did see, you

00:52.393 --> 00:55.958
know, it was, It was like a military barracks in a 
sense. You had all these guys, and I don't know how

00:59.076 --> 01:03.241
they figured out where to study or what. And would, 
quite often, would they live there four years?

01:09.369 --> 01:10.470
This depends. Because some of them, a lot of them 
had part-time jobs cleaning up the dorms. And

01:15.596 --> 01:25.168
later on, I guess they could move into the military 
units if they wanted to, and that would be part... I

01:25.317 --> 01:26.038
was looking. I think my dad, I was an out-of-state 
student for the first semester, and I think our

01:26.459 --> 01:34.811
tuition was $50. The state, I think, was $25. All 
right. Basic division, and then what was your next

01:41.721 --> 01:45.406
assignment? Well, I worked with Coach Bryant when 
he first came with academics, And Jerry Claverin

01:52.688 --> 01:58.194
was their coach. Scholastic person. All right, 
tell me as much as you can about... Claverin.

02:04.521 --> 02:08.686
Bryant and the whole... Oh, listen, he was an 
impressive guy. I guess you go through life, and of

02:08.866 --> 02:18.317
course having been in the military, you see what I 
consider good leadership. And I remember Willie

02:18.337 --> 02:21.480
Zappalack brought him over there and introduced 
him to me. And I looked at Coach Bryant, and he

02:24.735 --> 02:37.133
looked at me, and I had the feeling that he could see 
what I was saying, thinking, you know, like my dad

02:24.735 --> 02:37.133
could. Boy, he could read me better than anybody I 
ever saw. And he said, I'm glad to meet you. And 20

02:44.204 --> 02:49.071
years later, I went to a reunion, opened the back 
door, and Coach Bryant said, hi, bud. He said, I

02:51.223 --> 02:54.187
never did thank you for all the help you gave me. I 
wasn't paid or anything. Football ticket. Then

02:59.516 --> 03:09.611
later on, when he left and Coach Myers was hired, 
they wanted me to go part-time, which I did.

03:11.855 --> 03:14.239
With Coach Bryant, you did what? You advised 
athletes? Advised them. checked on their grades,

03:17.418 --> 03:27.531
and we set up, I did with Bob Smith, set up a good 
computer type system that teachers could just

03:17.418 --> 03:27.531
fill out a card. You may have seen that later on, and 
you just dropped it in the canvas. Can you imagine

03:32.538 --> 03:34.441
what it'd be like today? Was that the first time 
that had been done? Oh yeah. In fact, as I visited

03:39.207 --> 03:43.813
over at Coach Rawls, he was another one that was 
just He said, y'all do more for the regular

03:44.283 --> 03:48.107
students over there than we do for athletes. And 
Lance Hewlett had been over there a couple or three

03:48.127 --> 03:51.010
years. And, you know, basic region had a lot. It was 
ahead of its time. Probably, well, they've got it

03:57.757 --> 04:05.185
running now in a different terminology, I guess. 
All right. Well, we want to come back to Bryant.

04:07.847 --> 04:08.468
Let's go back. Who started the basic division? Who 
deserves the credit? I often would have to tell you

04:12.699 --> 04:35.424
because I was working in the Veterans 
Administration for the education in psychology,

04:12.699 --> 04:35.424
and they kind of put this thing together as best I 
could understand, and then later on they said,

04:12.699 --> 04:35.424
well, we're going to close down the Veterans 
Testing Service because the deal had run out with

04:12.699 --> 04:35.424
the college. It is after the war, though, the basic 
division. Yeah, 50 or 51. Okay. Alright, back to

04:40.789 --> 04:43.272
Bryant. Describe Bryant physically. Big man.

04:49.399 --> 04:51.121
Six feet? Well, I couldn't tell you that really. I 
only talked to him a couple of times in his four

04:53.884 --> 04:58.609
years here. But I was really impressed with the 
caliber of kids that he had recruited. He had a bum

05:06.258 --> 05:08.340
or two. He doesn't ever get credit for the 
academics. Because Charlie Krueger, I had cut him

05:12.470 --> 05:22.426
down to 12 hours, and he made 24 great ones, which 
is... Then, of course, he was... Now, listen, he

05:12.470 --> 05:22.426
went to high school in Caldwell. Mm-hmm. And was 
going up to Tarleton, and they hired Willie

05:23.388 --> 05:31.561
Zappalat to come here, and Charlie comes here. 
Okay. Now, Bryant's first year, he had recruited a

05:32.042 --> 05:35.948
ton of freshmen. because there was no limit. Yeah, 
I've got that list. All right, in general,

05:38.871 --> 05:47.620
academically, those... Well, outside of one or 
two were good students. Dennis Gehring, of

05:47.680 --> 05:52.986
course, had been out at Junction with me that 
previous year. So I knew him. I knew his parents,

05:57.150 --> 06:00.934
too. He was from San Marcos. And then they had, 
let's see, the guy that started Church's Chicken.

06:09.743 --> 06:15.931
When you see these guys 20 years later, it verifies 
what you thought at the time. And I was in Foulboy.

06:18.374 --> 06:27.305
Two that were already here one year when he came, 
that played in, Gene Stallings and Drake Keith.

06:27.405 --> 06:29.828
Did you ever work with either of them? Oh, yeah. 
Well, they were good students. Their main sweat

06:34.033 --> 06:35.955
was just making... coaches cutting the roster. I 
remember Gene talking about that. Of course, I've

06:44.337 --> 06:48.382
got a fondness for him, I always have. He was 
awfully young when he came here. Alright, Coach

06:53.769 --> 06:56.712
Claiborne, Jerry Claiborne, what were his 
duties? Well, he was basically,

06:57.153 --> 07:05.082
I don't know what area, they didn't have as many 
coaches in those days, but I would imagine Bax or

07:05.551 --> 07:08.916
someone. They lived over in Walton Hall, he and his 
wife. But wasn't he the key person on the academic

07:11.961 --> 07:16.528
part? He was the academic. I mean, that was, I gave 
all the information to him and he'd come by. You

07:23.758 --> 07:27.304
know, we had a good relationship and corresponded 
for years. Conducted in tech and all over and

07:27.564 --> 07:34.815
stopped by to see him one time up there when he was 
out of his office. Did, in the, do you recall any

07:35.082 --> 07:40.427
academic? Five beta kappa. I know he was, in 
history if I'm not mistaken. Yes, and he had, Coach

07:45.632 --> 07:53.900
Bryant used to give a suit of clothes to the highest 
academic person on the ball court. He wanted four

07:53.920 --> 07:56.342
years to grow. Coach said, I'm going to quit giving 
this money. Of course, you can't. I guess that was

08:01.643 --> 08:05.227
legitimate in those days, as long as you didn't 
know about it. I guess today you couldn't do that,

08:06.068 --> 08:08.331
could you? Oh, this is like the federal 
government. They got their hands all over you. All

08:12.996 --> 08:15.499
right. Any other academic prizes that you 
remember? Oh, I remember D. Powell. And let's see,

08:23.008 --> 08:30.216
the, I'm trying to think of the, Cawthorn, was he? I 
almost have to go to a list. All right. Can you share

08:34.897 --> 08:39.601
any near misses where somebody just barely got by? 
Not until later. Okay. All right. So Coach Bryant

08:46.288 --> 08:48.210
is here four years. Four years. And you're the 
volunteer during that time. Right. So you're

08:54.996 --> 09:00.562
helping athletics on top of your basic division 
job. Right. and later on after he left and this was

09:01.516 --> 09:16.873
maybe a year later I found out that he had wanted to 
hire me full-time and Bertrand wouldn't let him

09:01.516 --> 09:16.873
talk to me. Right now basic division during the 
Bryant years was directed by John Bertrand and he

09:16.893 --> 09:27.285
came about when? I couldn't tell you that because 
that was all They put it over there in the Aggieland

09:29.562 --> 09:31.641
Inn. And I was clear across campus at Bazell, kind 
of like Snook was when I was a freshman. Where is it?

09:42.346 --> 09:44.128
And Pearl Harbor, where is it? Okay, then,

09:46.192 --> 09:52.021
did you stay in? Basic Division. Okay, right. And 
then when Coach Myers came, and of course that was

09:56.147 --> 10:00.514
an interesting story too, board had three 
statements. You may have heard this story. No,

10:05.556 --> 10:06.817
please share it. They had Eddie Erdelatz, Red 
Sanders, and Jim Myers down here in the MSC at the

10:07.077 --> 10:15.925
same time. Alright, so that's the head coach at the 
Naval Academy at UCLA and Myers was Iowa State. And

10:26.915 --> 10:29.117
that was the deal when the kids sent that telegram 
that had all the signatures to Coach Meyer. They

10:36.718 --> 10:37.979
hired him. What kid? The C. The CORE. The CORE here. 
Yeah. As far as you're aware, who were the chief

10:44.747 --> 10:49.073
decision makers? Couldn't tell you. Was it the 
board? Well, I guess.

10:56.742 --> 10:59.205
I was there in the MSC and saw every one of them. I 
mean, that's I. I take a note on that. I don't know. I

11:06.236 --> 11:12.264
can't even remember who was on the board because, 
you know, that's like general so-and-so.

11:13.585 --> 11:16.128
Describe Coach Meyer's style. Well, I was 
personally fond of Meyer. One, he had children,

11:21.935 --> 11:25.800
and I'm talking with, talking with him. He could 
tell you, you know, when the kids were born and

11:26.973 --> 11:31.039
changing diapers. He never got, you know, like 
Gene did when he came out there and put that big old

11:31.059 --> 11:40.893
office in there for the time. Now, let's see. So, 
and Coach Myers comes in 1958. It was his first full

11:46.581 --> 11:49.304
season. And we signed, I was at Junkie. They signed 
114 freshmen. Of course, as far as I know, I came

11:58.153 --> 12:05.039
back to campus, nobody had filled out 
applications. It was kind of a... But then they

12:07.702 --> 12:15.890
recommended me full-time, and I interviewed with 
the athletic council, O.D. Butler. And then you

12:17.632 --> 12:20.375
went full-time. Well, I talked. two courses in 
education. It was four-fifths. Okay, and

12:25.202 --> 12:27.024
describe your duties then. Well, it was one of 
those nice things. I'm glad I had all the

12:31.169 --> 12:32.931
experiences. Well, Bud will take care of this. You 
know, all the books, all the course assignments,

12:35.575 --> 12:43.625
checking on their academics.

12:45.187 --> 12:46.949
We had an episode there. I can't remember. It might 
have been with Hank or Fulberg or Coach Myers, the

12:52.045 --> 13:01.136
little nurses over at the hospital were giving out 
those little chits, you know, the authorized

12:52.045 --> 13:01.136
absence, little white deals that they take to 
claim. That may have been before your time. And

13:04.721 --> 13:10.629
they put out a list, you know, remember at the end of 
the week, and they put a lot of those athletes on

13:04.721 --> 13:10.629
there. Got that shut down real good. Wait, the list 
of? The authorized absence list came out, you

13:13.572 --> 13:19.580
know, in a big old mimeograph, legal sign. Mm-hmm. 
So there was a lot of, and of course we had athletes

13:20.665 --> 13:27.431
scattered all over the campus.

13:29.493 --> 13:31.675
Dormitories, I had the housing. Your 
responsibilities were all sports. All sports,

13:34.177 --> 13:38.481
all scholarship, but we didn't. And of course 
football, numerically football would have been

13:38.501 --> 13:44.466
by far the largest in number. What sports did we 
have in those days? Track. Track was pretty big.

13:51.893 --> 13:57.943
Basketball was, you know, wasn't too big, not like 
it is today.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.410
Swimming, golf, tennis.

14:06.196 --> 14:09.161
You left corner wrong. Baseball. Chandler was, 
you know, he was real good about taking care of his

14:11.265 --> 14:15.512
kids. Shelby was, you know. All right, so as you go 
over there, the head coaches were...

14:17.146 --> 14:29.243
Charlie Thomas. No, not yet. Was he? Yeah. Ray 
Putnam messed with the... Colonel Andy had

14:37.956 --> 14:39.257
already retired? Oh, yeah. Okay, Charlie Thomas. 
Then baseball. Chandler. Tom Chandler. Bo Bell, I

14:45.277 --> 14:49.483
wasn't connected when Bo was over there. That was 
in the early 50s, 51, 2, and 3, and of course mine.

14:55.211 --> 14:58.836
Then basketball had the... Floyd. Yeah. And then 
Shelby was the freshman coach. Which of those

15:05.745 --> 15:12.575
coaches were most academically concerned? Well, 
Shelby was when he was freshman coach. Charlie,

15:16.833 --> 15:26.485
you know, I shouldn't say this, but you know 
Charlie as well as I do, he'd rather be fishing

15:16.833 --> 15:26.485
probably. But you had to keep it, you know, 
Charlie, some guy would call him and tell him,

15:26.506 --> 15:41.765
we've got this high jumper, jump six, five, which 
was, you know, that wasn't even possible in those

15:26.506 --> 15:41.765
days. And he'd check, he'd, called down to check 
out a car and Chandler, I was sitting there and

15:43.377 --> 15:52.068
Chandler said, Charlie, don't you think you ought 
to call some of the coaches in this district and

15:43.377 --> 15:52.068
see? Well, it was five.

15:57.876 --> 16:01.520
But that was later, let's see, Edgar?

16:05.305 --> 16:09.891
I don't know, that's when we got all those 
sprinters that never hit a lick. They were really,

16:10.597 --> 16:16.604
they were excellent high school, but they were 
always hurt when they got here. All right, and once

16:18.046 --> 16:19.687
you're over there full time. Then

16:21.029 --> 16:27.737
the tutorial program, the evening thing, four 
nights a week. All right, when did, was that, was

16:28.197 --> 16:33.403
that a new, did the tutorial program start? When we 
moved into Henderson. Describe that. Well, we

16:36.667 --> 16:40.131
had, I employed tutors. And we were paying the 
outrageous salary of $1.50. An hour? An hour. And I

16:46.409 --> 16:47.530
had some of the best. Of course, they tend to group 
together. They recommend a kid to you. He's first

16:54.440 --> 16:55.261
class. I mean, there was never any question. 
You're saying tutors recommended new tutors?

17:00.468 --> 17:00.608
Mm-hmm. Okay. And we had English, mathematics, 
and the sciences, both biology and chemistry. And

17:08.318 --> 17:09.780
it was posted online. They knew what nights the 
tutors would be there, and I'd go through

17:09.963 --> 17:17.515
Henderson and get them down there. Of course, we'd 
have a few that were over playing pool, but Coach

17:17.535 --> 17:25.727
Myers kind of put it down. Miss Murphy was the house 
mother, and the coaches were pretty tough on them.

17:34.221 --> 17:38.367
Describe dormitory life in Henderson Hall. I'll 
tell you one thing that I did, and you know, you look

17:39.865 --> 17:55.080
back on these things and it's kind of funny today, 
but I had two areas that I insisted that every

17:39.865 --> 17:55.080
student take with electing. One was business law, 
both courses, and the other one was old Bob Boone's

17:55.100 --> 18:02.847
music appreciation. Now when those kids come in at 
the beginning of the year, you could walk down the

18:02.867 --> 18:07.932
hall You talk about the conglomerate of music, or 
lack of music, as I used to joke, and then as they

18:08.097 --> 18:33.739
move on down to junior year after they've had 
Boone's course, and I told Bob this, I said, it just

18:08.097 --> 18:33.739
did your heart good to see that after all we were 
putting some class on, but they just never had been

18:08.097 --> 18:33.739
exposed to it. Well, as you recall, what was their 
favorite major? Engineering. That certainly

18:40.206 --> 18:42.290
wasn't an easy one. It wasn't a pushover. Of course 
we had the two Hargit's for instance. They were

18:48.502 --> 18:51.708
just outstanding. I had one of them that played 
quarterback in my class. I remember what grade he

18:54.574 --> 18:56.518
made for me. He came in the dorm one night and just 
looked like Death warmed over and I said, what's

19:00.005 --> 19:02.089
the matter? And he said, I made 46 on that physics 
test. And I said, what was the highest grade? 46. I

19:11.167 --> 19:14.133
said, what are you worried about? And they were, 
boy, they were mean in that basic physics and

19:14.153 --> 19:19.043
engineering class. I often wondered if it 
wouldn't be better to let them take it later. And I

19:23.945 --> 19:24.426
did. On a lot of students, I wouldn't let them take 
chemistry 101 until the second semester. You're

19:28.450 --> 19:31.814
in a smaller class, you've got your better 
teachers. That's how I worked anyway. What was

19:35.979 --> 19:39.482
kind of the major of last resort? If they couldn't 
make it in anything else, where did they go? I don't

19:44.648 --> 19:46.330
really remember, because I didn't have We really 
didn't have that many students. I think one time I

19:48.633 --> 19:53.901
figured out we had, Myers was shocked. I compiled 
some statistics sometime in his second or third

19:53.921 --> 19:58.949
year. Hell, 85% of the kids were graduating. The 
football. Of course, we weren't winning any

20:04.837 --> 20:06.600
football. Of course, he knew that later.

20:11.287 --> 20:14.612
Which sports had the highest graduation rate, you 
think? Surprisingly, golf. Okay, I'm not

20:16.974 --> 20:20.278
surprised. And Henry Ransom was about as loose 
jointed as any coach I've ever met. He called me the

20:25.344 --> 20:29.569
night before and said, will you want to take the 
boys up to Arkansas? I said, not on short notice,

20:29.589 --> 20:31.832
Henry. Don't do this.

20:35.897 --> 20:44.667
What about some of the stunts or pranks that you 
remember that they did in or around Henderson

20:35.897 --> 20:44.667
Hall? Well, I just, they were pretty good because I 
was over there usually from 7 till 9 or 9.30, just

20:45.170 --> 20:54.505
depending on what was going on. I just never had any 
difficulty. I was trying to think of this little

20:58.652 --> 21:08.368
old guard, had his car parked out in that little 
area back of the chapel. It was a little kind of a

21:08.388 --> 21:11.734
driveway looking thing. He went out one morning 
and his engine had been fanned out tonight. I wish I

21:19.230 --> 21:20.872
could think of anything. He was from San Antonio. 
This was done by some of his buddies? No, I think

21:24.576 --> 21:26.318
somebody else. Oh, really? We used to have trouble 
until Meeks and I got the school to come in and put

21:27.560 --> 21:35.388
iron bars. They'd come through the steam tunnels 
and come in down in the electrical stuff down in our

21:42.089 --> 21:43.351
deal. That was really dangerous. You mentioned 
Meeks. Tell me about that man. He was a classic. Of

21:51.925 --> 21:56.533
course, I was especially fond of him because his 
wife talked to my boys. And his, what's his full

21:56.553 --> 21:59.698
name? I don't know. S.M. was all I knew. And you all 
called him Monk. And his duties were? Everything

22:08.228 --> 22:11.311
like mine is equipment, basically. But he was kind 
of a father confessor. He and old Pickard both. And

22:16.317 --> 22:18.339
he came over here about what, when? Came with 
bones, so I guess that would be late. Late 50s. Oh,

22:24.546 --> 22:25.447
yeah. Because I came, in the summer of 59, I taught 
at Shriner in Kerrville before coming over here.

22:32.094 --> 22:33.456
And I came over with his son. His older boy was 
there. SM Junior was there. coach there and came

22:36.713 --> 22:43.500
over and spent the night in Henderson Hall looking 
for an apartment. So where did you find the

22:44.661 --> 22:46.743
apartment? Well, we found a house out on Cindy Lane 
across from Lynn the Shoe Factory for $85 a month,

22:46.763 --> 23:01.779
which we thought was really high priced because I 
made $5.50 a month for nine months. That was my job.

23:05.468 --> 23:07.170
Well, you know, that was interesting. We were 
talking about that on that college station thing.

23:10.796 --> 23:17.145
When I finished school, I went over to Groveton to 
interview a friend of mine who was head coach.

23:17.165 --> 23:19.989
Three classes of history, three sports. And that 
was $2,400. And they offered me this director of

23:22.533 --> 23:29.403
the counseling center, $3,600. For 12 months, 
man. $300 a month. And I thought, boy, that That was

23:35.742 --> 23:36.523
something. All right, these other staff members 
in athletics, who was the head trainer in the 50s?

23:46.411 --> 23:46.812
Billy, I guess. Who? Billy Pickard. Billy 
Pickard? Yeah. Before, now, Hank brought in a guy.

23:58.061 --> 23:58.462
I'm trying to think. There's a policeman, or used 
to be the spokesman for the Bryan Police

23:58.482 --> 24:03.306
Department. He lived out on Luzia Lane. But he left 
here and went to Tulane. He was a good trainer. And

24:09.586 --> 24:13.870
who

24:09.586 --> 24:13.870
was the business officer? Pat Dyle. Describe. 
Well, Pat was, he was an unusual guy. I was really

24:23.038 --> 24:27.602
overwhelmed at the tremendous job that he did with 
tickets. I didn't, you know, not having been

24:27.622 --> 24:33.407
exposed to that until I went to work full time and 
you go down there See this little one, so much

24:33.843 --> 24:36.826
bigger than this. All the tickets for all the 
sports and the season passes. It wasn't that big an

24:41.752 --> 24:45.396
operation. Now, who was the athletic director?

24:50.361 --> 24:51.883
Well, Myers, I guess. I'm not sure if Myers was the 
athletic director. I think Bones was brought in by

24:56.588 --> 24:59.671
Brian. Now, you haven't given him his full name 
yet. Who? Barlow. Barlow. Barlow, Bones, Earl.

25:07.159 --> 25:10.283
You know, it goes through all this line. He came 
from San Antonio, I believe, didn't he? Yeah, I

25:12.506 --> 25:21.357
think Brian must have hired

25:12.506 --> 25:21.357
him.

25:21.377 --> 25:23.861
I guess that's about it. Small, I can remember the 
day close to just before leaving when we had a

25:24.301 --> 25:32.672
million dollar budget. Bones, that was a shock. As 
far as you know, knew then, was the budget balanced

25:37.328 --> 25:42.253
at Athletics Page? Oh yeah, they were in the black. 
That's one thing Bones could do. And, you know, for

25:46.677 --> 25:54.826
me to go and say, now this Tiff has been here a year, I 
think he needs at least a quarter more raise. Now,

25:55.847 --> 25:56.968
let me think about it. Well, I knew I had Bones. 
Bones knew We were doing a good job in the academic

26:00.513 --> 26:06.280
area, and I never had any problem with that. 
Alright, on the athletic part, as you now look back

26:06.300 --> 26:16.934
on it, what were the things that y'all were doing 
that obviously... Guidance, real. We took a

26:19.597 --> 26:27.347
guidance program that had been through the 
Veterans Administration, through the basic

26:19.597 --> 26:27.347
division, through the adjunct program, and took 
the best parts of all of that. And it's the contact

26:31.614 --> 26:34.076
with the student. They know you're there. They can 
depend on you. And I always felt they had a feeling

26:38.481 --> 26:45.669
that I wasn't gonna mess them up. And I had two or 
three athletes like old Ken Tim and some of the

26:45.689 --> 26:54.598
basketball, old dude, Doug McClain is McClain's 
coach. Yeah. He was the best-read student we had in

26:55.458 --> 26:58.062
the dormitory. Did you ever know that? He read all 
the time. Now, I don't know if he didn't kill

27:01.907 --> 27:05.172
himself on his textbooks, probably. But he came up 
to me one time. I insisted the juniors go to the

27:09.859 --> 27:15.487
Registrar's office and check their credits. I had 
a running thing in the office. tried to apprise

27:18.712 --> 27:23.700
him, particularly guys like dude, but he doesn't 
pay attention. So he comes up his last, his senior

27:24.261 --> 27:29.009
semester. Am I going to graduate? And I said, now, 
dude, did you go there? No. Did you go this year? No.

27:35.499 --> 27:40.767
I said, well, you lack about 15, 16 more credits. 
No, I guess it was 24 to to graduate. Well, he stayed

27:45.638 --> 27:49.363
over at Stallings, you remember, and did a good 
job. Went to law school. Let me tell you my favorite

27:53.169 --> 27:55.352
one. He took my Old South Advanced History course, 
and you had to do a term paper. And when I got to his

28:02.822 --> 28:07.669
term paper, Harry, what's his name? No, go ahead. 
This dude, McLean. Oh, yeah. Dude. And he turned in

28:12.686 --> 28:16.552
a term paper, and I started reading it. And each 
paragraph began with quotation marks and ended

28:17.614 --> 28:21.900
with quotation marks. There was not a single 
grammatical error. Everything, every paragraph

28:24.564 --> 28:27.048
had a footnote. But none of the paragraph, and 
there was a long bibliography, and all,

28:28.190 --> 28:34.399
everything, but None of the paragraphs had any 
particular relationship to any of the other

28:34.936 --> 28:39.421
paragraphs. And so I put an F on it, passed it out, 
and with a note, come see me. He came in and I said,

28:47.730 --> 28:50.113
dude, explain this to me. He said, well, as you can 
probably see, that's not my work. And I said, oh. He

28:56.259 --> 28:58.242
said, I put it off until the last minute. And I then 
went to the library and checked out about two dozen

28:58.742 --> 29:02.226
books. And I just put marks on various pages and 
told the secretary to type those up and take the

29:03.033 --> 29:10.674
first paragraph on each page. And I thought maybe 
that you would be in a hurry and you'd just glance at

29:11.195 --> 29:16.570
it and give me a grade. And I said, well, you know, 
I've got to give you an F. And he said, I'm not

29:16.938 --> 29:21.465
surprised at all. And he grinned and went on. And we 
both chuckled about it. I told him, I said, dude,

29:28.996 --> 29:32.001
I'll probably tell this story a good many times. He 
did the same thing to Charlie McCandless. Is that

29:34.445 --> 29:34.905
right? No, no. As you know, Dr. McCandless.

29:42.892 --> 29:46.617
This was Charles Gaddon's course, 426. Charles 
McCandless. Charles McCandless. And I go over

29:50.061 --> 29:54.667
there, and he hands me this thing, and I look at the 
bibliography. It was a paper just like that. I

29:56.249 --> 30:00.735
looked at the bibliography, and looked at the 
front, the table, contents, and everything. And

30:01.816 --> 30:06.762
then I got to thumbing through it, and I said, I 
wonder where he got it. It was my paper.

30:11.088 --> 30:11.689
I don't know where. Maybe... I'm sure it wasn't in 
the old boys' file because we didn't keep stuff

30:13.486 --> 30:18.693
like that. You mentioned Hargetts. Who are some 
others you look back on with great pride as being

30:22.919 --> 30:29.828
proud to have worked with them? You get in Jeff 
Andrick, the insurance guy here. Lloyd Curry. I

30:37.837 --> 30:42.244
mean, guys, well, Currington had to work hard. 
There was a kid from Kern, Franklin.

30:48.914 --> 30:51.077
I really can't. Ellison, I gave him a Bible for 
graduation because he was big. Carter? Carter

30:57.848 --> 31:00.171
Franklin. His highest test score on any of his 
tests at admission was a 4%. He was an honor. He won

31:10.835 --> 31:16.302
the graduate fellowship that they gave. At the 
same time, I said, what did you do with, he got a set

31:16.322 --> 31:28.178
of encyclopedias, gave them to his daughter, I 
mean to his sister who was at Baylor, one of the

31:16.322 --> 31:28.178
junior colleges. We correspond spasmodically 
now, but those guys are in their 60s.

31:35.279 --> 31:41.222
But old dude, he was one that he and Ken Timmons, I 
finally talked to him.
