WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:05.502
Testing, testing, this is a test, this is a test. 
Let me just stop. That's quite okay. Today's

00:08.905 --> 00:12.948
interview is with Brigadier General Travis M. 
Hetherington. Today's Tuesday, August 12, 1980.

00:17.272 --> 00:18.934
Let's start with your upbringing. You were born in 
Reagan, Texas, February 20, 1908. Can you tell us

00:24.519 --> 00:26.641
about your father? Well, my dad... My mother and 
dad lived on a farm south of Reagan, Texas, about

00:30.541 --> 00:35.586
two miles. And my father was born in Alabama, and he 
came to Texas with my grandmother and grandfather

00:37.127 --> 00:53.762
when he was about four years old. And they settled 
in Falls County, along with around six brothers

01:00.764 --> 01:04.010
and two sisters. Why'd they come from Alabama? 
Well, it's hard to say. I mean, I don't really know.

01:11.282 --> 01:25.506
It seemed to me in visiting Monroeville, Alabama, 
where my dad was born, that everybody was going to

01:26.313 --> 01:37.222
new territories, getting new land and

01:26.313 --> 01:37.222
that was just the way it was. Now why they came to 
Falls County I don't know because it seemed to me

01:37.783 --> 01:45.189
that Falls County is probably the poorest part of 
Texas. And of course after the war, after the Civil

01:46.230 --> 01:55.678
War, apparently the schools were all broken And my 
dad, well, I think he went through the eighth grade

01:56.452 --> 02:01.499
or something of this sort. And the same thing 
applied to my mother. How many acres did your

02:05.645 --> 02:08.949
father have on his ranch? Well, he had, oh, I think 
around 290 acres. It was really a farm. It was a

02:19.784 --> 02:22.187
cotton and corn farm. Okay, cotton and corn. Let me 
start. Okay, we're doing fine as far as that's

02:26.455 --> 02:31.543
concerned now. 290 acres, what kind of livelihood 
could you make off that? Well, it was very nice as

02:35.349 --> 02:38.153
far as I was concerned. I had two brothers and two 
sisters. I had one older brother who was about 15

02:42.220 --> 02:53.678
months older than I, and then I had a younger 
brother that was about three years younger than I.

02:55.328 --> 03:20.880
And of course when you have your own cows and your 
own meat and your own hogs and your own vegetable

02:55.328 --> 03:20.880
garden and why there isn't much to buy other than 
sugar and at one time why we even had sugar cane on

02:55.328 --> 03:20.880
the farm and we

03:22.750 --> 03:35.643
had a cane mill and a horse drawn with one horse 
running around and so we ran the cane through the

03:22.750 --> 03:35.643
press and then we cooked it out and made syrup. And 
of course

03:35.663 --> 03:45.754
my dad peddled beef on almost every Saturday. When 
I was growing up we would slaughter a yearling on

03:51.320 --> 04:01.952
Friday afternoon, Friday night, cut it up, and 
then he would take it to Reagan in a horse-drawn

03:51.320 --> 04:01.952
wagon. He had a beef enclosure on the back, and he 
just paled his beef. Now this is a time, a little bit

04:09.381 --> 04:14.627
earlier than this, was the time of populism. and 
populism was a fairly strong force in Texas. Did he

04:18.756 --> 04:21.759
ever talk about politics and populism? No, no. You 
never discussed politics? No, no. I think he was

04:26.303 --> 04:30.026
more concerned about making a living. Sure. And we 
really never did get into any big discussion about

04:31.347 --> 04:38.393
politics. Of course, later on, when John L. Lewis 
was a strong man in the coal miner being chief of the

04:45.185 --> 05:04.484
coal mine union while he was very verbose and being 
against the coal miners and things of this sort,

04:45.185 --> 05:04.484
trying to get more money when he thought everybody 
should

04:45.185 --> 05:04.484
make a living off the land, I guess. What kind of 
education did he have? I don't really remember,

05:11.408 --> 05:18.579
but I'm sure he only went through about sixth or 
seventh grade.

05:22.105 --> 05:29.496
He was very good at mathematics and being a 
merchant type of thing. He was very, very honest.

05:30.818 --> 05:33.683
As far as I know, he never cheated anybody out of a 
nickel. He was very, very honest.

05:40.754 --> 05:43.217
and of course he peddled his watermelons. I mean he 
loved to go to town and he loved to talk, so

05:43.237 --> 05:50.866
everybody knew him of course. And he had a lot of 
good friends in the buy-in, Mr. Robbins in the

05:52.008 --> 06:06.205
blacksmith shop and Mr. Wesley Shonfield who was 
in the grocery business.

06:09.374 --> 06:11.816
Now, you have a master's degree in business. Did he 
ever stress education with you? Well, both my

06:15.620 --> 06:24.769
mother and dad and us growing up, their objective 
was that we graduate from high school. I mean, that

06:24.829 --> 06:26.411
was really their objective. They insisted that we 
were going to stay in school if it took us 25 years to

06:26.451 --> 06:34.279
do it, to graduate from high school. And then, of 
course, when I graduated from high school, He

06:39.260 --> 06:42.985
said, this is where I stop and you begin. And he 
said, if you ever need some money and need to borrow

06:43.145 --> 06:56.543
some money to do whatever you want to do, he would go 
on my note, but as far as he would go.

07:01.449 --> 07:08.338
So they insisted we go to Ann also. Mother was 
primarily the individual who saw that we got our

07:09.736 --> 07:17.924
lessons. And of course, she helped us out as long as 
we were in the lower grades. But when we got in the

07:26.371 --> 07:33.638
higher grades, it got beyond her capability, 
although she was well-read. I mean, she read

07:33.678 --> 07:38.022
everything she'd get her hands on. She wasn't 
really educated as far as mathematics and algebra

07:39.352 --> 07:46.840
and all that type of thing was concerned. Let's 
talk about the farm for a minute. You raised

07:49.122 --> 07:49.943
cotton. Did you have sharecroppers on to do this, 
or did you do it yourselves? No, we did this

07:55.489 --> 07:58.872
ourselves. In our younger years, we had what I call 
old Lewis and Liza.

08:10.469 --> 08:13.272
He was quite a character. He had been in jail a 
number of times. And he had around his wrist, just

08:19.117 --> 08:27.825
like the palm of your hand, and around his ankles, 
just like the palm of your hand. It was where he had

08:27.865 --> 08:31.128
had chains on. And he had one ear that had been 
bitten off while he was in jail. Bitten off? Bitten

08:37.234 --> 08:38.215
off, yeah. Pretty mean jail. Well, that's right. 
Somebody was hungry. Well, he'd gotten in a fight.

08:48.679 --> 08:50.221
But anyway, he had gotten out. Are you a coffee 
drinker? Please. And so he worked in Chopcott, and

08:54.909 --> 09:03.544
he was a real good—

09:05.397 --> 09:07.539
I mean, he was a real good worker. I mean, boy, he 
could just kind of—and so he kind of took care of us

09:07.559 --> 09:11.804
boys. And the thing that you remember is going down 
to his house and sitting on his front porch eating

09:11.924 --> 09:28.423
cheese and crackers and lemonade, yeah. Well, at 
least he liked to work.

09:35.587 --> 09:47.838
So the things you remember is a very strange thing 
because I said go down to his house and he had

09:35.587 --> 09:47.838
probably a one-room or two-room cabin that was on 
the place. It was on your father's farm? Yeah.

09:52.922 --> 09:53.683
He was a sharecropper. Well, he didn't really 
share. He worked by the day. He was a day worker. He

09:58.587 --> 09:59.848
was a day worker.

10:02.570 --> 10:04.632
Paul, I don't know, Dad paid him so much money. 
hundred pounds of cotton he picked or so much per

10:05.303 --> 10:08.005
day. And gave him a place to stay? And gave him a 
place to stay. And

10:12.910 --> 10:18.055
of course he was an alcoholic. I mean they were 
saying tonight why he was going to get drunk and you

10:18.115 --> 10:27.684
knew that, but the rest of the week why he was just as 
good as you could find anywhere. But your father

10:27.704 --> 10:31.727
got in the wagon and went after him every time he 
didn't show up. He found him in town drunk in jail or

10:31.747 --> 10:34.770
something.

10:39.340 --> 10:41.462
Why was he in jail to begin with? Why was he in 
prison? Oh, I think he had killed somebody.

10:50.471 --> 11:01.321
But as far as we were concerned, as far as I was 
concerned, as far as my dad was concerned, he was

10:50.471 --> 11:01.321
just as safe as you could find. What did you learn 
from this man? Well, I would say that you learned

11:03.884 --> 11:08.368
how to work. Well, I don't know if you learned a lot, 
but the fact that he got out and I don't know if he was

11:09.361 --> 11:21.739
married or not, he at least lived with somebody. 
But anyway,

11:21.939 --> 11:36.820
he could chop cotton and so he was always out in 
front of us boys. Do you remember what you thought

11:37.795 --> 11:39.597
of him? Well, what I thought of him, I just thought 
he was a fine individual. And I think that your

11:45.144 --> 11:58.359
compassion for individuals who are not as 
straight in there as you are is increased.

11:58.439 --> 12:04.326
I think maybe that's what you, starting out your 
early life, I think that probably is It helps you

12:05.825 --> 12:14.633
out in your later... Did your relationship with 
him have any impact on your later thoughts about

12:05.825 --> 12:14.633
black Americans? No, I don't... I think in growing 
up, why... Well, I think it shows that everybody's

12:18.877 --> 12:27.565
not all bad or all good. I mean, even that man was not 
all bad. Well, later on, I mean, the... The boys who

12:33.078 --> 12:43.894
lived closest to us were,

12:33.078 --> 12:43.894
their last name was Cross. George and I and his two 
oldest boys were about the same age and they always

12:45.557 --> 12:59.558
came up and we played together and made toys out of 
corn cobs. And later on, when we got a little wagon

13:00.112 --> 13:08.041
or tricycle, we rode it down the hill that was next 
to our house. And I think it was no different from

13:08.161 --> 13:16.229
what you, the integration type of thing. In fact, I 
think it was. So the Crosses were a black family?

13:18.532 --> 13:19.072
Oh, yeah. Yeah. And he later on became a 
sharecropper for us, for my dad. And because we had

13:27.854 --> 13:38.353
moved from where I was born to the house where my 
grandmother and grandmother, grandfather and

13:27.854 --> 13:38.353
grandmother, mother Hetherington had lived. And 
when they passed away, by then my dad moved into

13:38.373 --> 13:52.258
their house and the Crosses moved into where we 
lived.

13:52.795 --> 14:05.369
I think it developed the fact that you had no 
animosity against color or because they were, as

13:52.795 --> 14:05.369
far as I was concerned, just as equal as we were. And 
they played with us, our toys, and we played with

14:05.529 --> 14:09.533
their toys. So you grew up in an integrated society 
then, unlike so many other Texans. Well, you do

14:16.020 --> 14:19.504
because you're in a little small town. We were out 
and on a farm. And

14:22.259 --> 14:51.743
we of course had the Kirkpatricks that lived right 
up the street from us and they were white and we

14:22.259 --> 14:51.743
probably had a total of around four or five boys who 
were in the same age group as we, so we played with

14:22.259 --> 14:51.743
them. And we played with them. You were really 
younger when you were in the five, six, seven,

14:54.916 --> 15:07.310
eight year old.

15:07.370 --> 15:13.776
You were playing with the crosses and what have 
you. But later on, when you got to be a teenager, we

15:13.796 --> 15:21.865
had about six. boys that we went hunting together 
and chased jackrabbits and went duck hunting, all

15:22.030 --> 15:36.564
this type of

15:22.030 --> 15:36.564
thing. Many people grow up in a society that has 
both races, especially in the South, yet they

15:36.704 --> 15:49.776
don't grow up to have feelings and that you've 
expressed, that is, that they're just as equal as

15:50.549 --> 15:55.137
we were. How can you account for the feeling that 
you obtained? Well, I think it's the same today. My

16:03.271 --> 16:10.043
grandchildren are in school

16:03.271 --> 16:10.043
with your And they make no difference or 
differentiation between whether or not the

16:11.508 --> 16:22.183
individual is white or whether or not he's black. 
Do you think your father, your parents had

16:23.144 --> 16:30.113
anything to do with your attitudes? Well, I would 
say so. I mean, there's no question about it. If

16:32.997 --> 16:38.545
they had talked about or downgraded the Lewis, old 
Lewis, or if they were afraid of him, or if they ever

16:39.082 --> 16:52.941
expressed any

16:39.082 --> 16:52.941
animosity towards him. But as far as my dad was 
concerned, as far as my mother was concerned, they

16:53.221 --> 17:03.015
really didn't make any difference between them.

17:05.879 --> 17:07.401
Okay, let's talk about your mother. Did you tell me 
about her? Well, she was born in Texas. Her father

17:13.270 --> 17:18.635
had come from, well, we're trying to find out. We 
think Kentucky, Paducah, Kentucky. And they had

17:22.719 --> 17:28.684
moved to Roberson County, which is next door to 
Falls County. And she was the youngest, I think, of

17:30.165 --> 17:36.831
a big family. She had about, I don't know if I'd have 
to count them, seven brothers and one sister. And

17:44.628 --> 17:50.354
she grew up around Bremont, which is about six, 
eight miles from there. And then, I don't know how

17:50.714 --> 18:07.273
my mother and dad met, but anyway,

17:50.714 --> 18:07.273
they were married, I guess, in around 1905 or 
somewhere along that. What kind of person was she?

18:09.316 --> 18:12.001
What kind of personality or character was she? Oh, 
she was a real strong individual. I

18:15.548 --> 18:30.595
would say

18:15.548 --> 18:30.595
she was a dominating type of individual.

18:31.334 --> 18:34.738
a type of individual that wouldn't hold us kids 
back. I mean, when we graduated from high school, a

18:34.758 --> 18:40.285
lot of mothers hang on. But whatever we decided to 
do, that was all right with her. And

18:46.993 --> 18:57.826
she expressed her opinion

18:46.993 --> 18:57.826
quite readily. And so... And she kept house and I 
don't ever remember her working in the fields at

19:02.823 --> 19:13.252
all. She took care of

19:15.254 --> 19:26.023
cooking the meals and cleaning the house and 
keeping her clothes clean and things of this sort.

19:27.304 --> 19:31.868
And my dad took care of providing for us all. Now you 
say she was a strong individual. Would you

19:34.301 --> 19:36.564
consider her the authority in the household? 
Well, I think to keep peace in the family, I think my

19:38.547 --> 19:46.077
dad gave in a lot.

19:50.664 --> 19:52.246
They really didn't fight very much. I mean, it was 
rather calm. But she was always saying, George, do

19:56.953 --> 19:59.276
this. George, do that. or George bring in the 
vegetables. Who had the final word? Well, I don't

20:06.594 --> 20:08.697
know. It's hard to say whether she had a final word 
or not, but

20:08.717 --> 20:20.316
she always had her own couple of cows. that she sold 
a year and got herself some money, which was her

20:21.140 --> 20:26.826
money. Oh, really? That's kind of unusual back in 
the early 1900s, isn't it? So she raised her own

20:32.492 --> 20:36.136
cattle right there? Well, he took care of them, of 
course, but she had her own cows, and there was only

20:36.317 --> 20:45.747
about two or three. she didn't accumulate a lot of 
money. And then of course she loved flowers, so she

20:47.945 --> 20:56.498
could spend her egg money and her cow money on 
whatever she wanted to. And so she bought flowers

20:56.678 --> 21:04.490
and flower seeds and pots and this type of thing. So 
she worked in the yard.

21:08.656 --> 21:12.021
And she sold and

21:14.549 --> 21:23.159
made a lot of things for for the for us boys and also 
for our my sisters as when they grew up. What about

21:23.179 --> 21:24.081
your father? What kind of personality or 
character was he? Well very kind, very I would say

21:27.124 --> 21:32.030
very generous. Never really raised a lot of heck. I 
mean far as Spankin's a concern. There's very few,

21:41.453 --> 21:44.536
I'd say. Not that we didn't need them. We all need 
them. No, I would say we had a very calm household.

21:58.007 --> 21:59.188
Okay, let's look at it this way. You've had a very 
successful career. In which ways would you

22:02.131 --> 22:07.455
consider that your parents were responsible for 
that? Well, I would say insisting on going to

22:10.237 --> 22:14.701
school, that we attend school, not play hooky. You 
and Dad not play hooky.

22:21.267 --> 22:24.049
And met reasonably good grades. They really 
didn't push us as far as making A's or B's or C's as

22:24.069 --> 22:31.336
long as we passed. And they always said that if we 
ever got a whipping at school, we were going to get

22:31.356 --> 22:38.522
another one at home.

22:39.616 --> 22:43.019
I only got one whipping at school and they never 
knew about it. So

22:44.080 --> 23:08.863
I would say insisting on us getting through high 
school and then after getting through high school

22:44.080 --> 23:08.863
not really voicing any objection for permitting 
me to do whatever I wanted to do.

23:10.565 --> 23:25.462
And I figured, well of course when you are growing 
up, why your main objective is to graduate my

23:10.565 --> 23:25.462
school, you figure that when you graduate my 
school that would be all the education that you'd

23:10.565 --> 23:25.462
ever want or need. And of course after graduating 
and then along came the fall while I was ready to go

23:26.563 --> 23:38.496
to school, so I went to Tyler Commercial College. 
which is about a seven month course, and my dad went

23:39.117 --> 23:54.979
on a note at the First National Bank of Reagan, 
Texas for the tuition, and I went over and entered

23:39.117 --> 23:54.979
school. Now my older brother, after he graduated 
from high school, he stayed at home and worked on

23:55.240 --> 24:01.969
the farm for a year. you were really torn as to 
whether or not you should do the same thing. Well, I

24:06.823 --> 24:08.085
didn't. I decided I was going to have to go to Tyler 
Commercial College. And of course, in those days,

24:13.772 --> 24:25.245
I rode a train from Reagan to Tyler, and I think that 
was probably the first time I'd ever been on a

24:13.772 --> 24:25.245
train. And in those days, I'm sure you understand 
that Well, I imagine I was fourteen before my dad

24:32.915 --> 24:46.212
got his first automobile, so your severe of 
activity was really within about three or four

24:32.915 --> 24:46.212
miles of home. Right. And

24:47.474 --> 25:02.213
so the first time I ever visited Hearn, which is 
only thirty miles away, was after my dad got an

24:47.474 --> 25:02.213
automobile when I was about fifteen. And

25:02.598 --> 25:12.828
Marlin, Texas, which was about 12 miles away, you 
never got up there. And then after he got an

25:14.810 --> 25:22.358
automobile, then we went to the movies in Marlin. 
But I would say that primarily is the fact that they

25:24.640 --> 25:31.187
insisted on us getting an education through high 
school. the second thing is is not interfere with

25:31.522 --> 26:00.263
uh with our activities or what we want to do 
afterwards okay okay now you had two brothers two

25:31.522 --> 26:00.263
sisters right how'd you get along with them oh real 
well i mean we uh my three brothers my two brothers

25:31.522 --> 26:00.263
and i uh well we slept in the same bed for uh I guess 
until we were twelve or thirteen. And of course my

26:04.134 --> 26:16.427
younger brother was, after I left home,

26:04.134 --> 26:16.427
the year after I left home, he was killed on a hay 
rake. And I was working at that time for Lawrence

26:16.447 --> 26:23.534
Grocery Company. And of course your sisters, they 
were much younger and therefore I

26:31.647 --> 26:41.762
guess you got along just about as well as any 
teenage boy gets along with kid sisters. They

26:42.703 --> 26:57.705
always, my oldest sister,

26:42.703 --> 26:57.705
I think she was born in about 1915,

26:42.703 --> 26:57.705
and so I was about seven I guess when she was born. 
The only thing I can remember about her is she

26:58.107 --> 27:07.322
always wanted the neck of a chicken, but she 
wouldn't eat the neck, the first piece. It was

27:07.382 --> 27:09.425
always the last piece. So we were always 
scrambling for the neck, but that was her piece of

27:09.445 --> 27:15.074
chicken.

27:18.199 --> 27:25.431
But otherwise, by the time I was graduating from 
high school, she was just entering school. So

27:26.677 --> 27:29.220
there's a large age difference. Well, we thought 
it was a large age difference, but now it's really

27:29.921 --> 27:36.810
not a large age difference. Many generals that 
I've talked to have expressed episodes in their

27:36.830 --> 27:49.667
early lives that they thought had a significant 
impact on their later career. Do you have any

27:49.867 --> 27:54.253
episodes that might have had an impact on you? 
Well, I would say that probably the character that

27:54.571 --> 28:08.651
your mother and dad has affects your life a lot. I 
mean, I think that my dad being completely honest

28:08.672 --> 28:19.367
with all his dealings, didn't cheat anybody out of 
anything. He loved to work. And I think that the

28:23.950 --> 28:36.426
fact that he teaches you honesty and integrity and 
willingness to work, I think this is a big

28:23.950 --> 28:36.426
influence. I mean, I think it's a shame today that 
your young boys can't get a job and work.

28:47.760 --> 28:51.645
Yesterday, I was talking to a 16-year-old boy, He 
just couldn't get a job anywhere. By the time I was

28:54.759 --> 29:02.468
16,

28:54.759 --> 29:02.468
I was picking 200 pounds of cotton a day. And 
although you weren't getting a lot of allowances

29:03.089 --> 29:18.407
out of it, and you weren't being paid for doing it by 
the fact that he at least taught you that you liked

29:03.089 --> 29:18.407
to work. And I think maybe I'm a workaholic. Sure. 
And I think that's your upbringing and your

29:22.490 --> 29:32.963
honesty that when you say something why you mean it 
and things of this sort.

29:35.747 --> 29:38.190
Did religion play a role in your early life? Well I 
would say religion

29:39.151 --> 29:52.227
the only activities

29:39.151 --> 29:52.227
that you had out of your home was

29:53.084 --> 30:03.514
your Baptist young people's programs on Sunday 
evening.

30:06.537 --> 30:14.365
My mother was a primitive Baptist and my father was 
a missionary Baptist. So we joined the missionary

30:14.425 --> 30:22.213
Baptist church and we normally attended the

30:23.577 --> 30:37.317
church on our own, really, except my mother's 
church every fourth Sunday, normally. Of course,

30:37.577 --> 30:45.108
primitive Baptists are very primitive in their 
religion. They don't have pianos, as you might

30:45.528 --> 30:48.252
know. And they liked to sing, and the preachers 
liked to talk. And I can remember sometimes it

30:53.893 --> 31:01.461
would be three preachers preaching. The last guy 
would get up and say, I'm not going to say anything.

31:04.424 --> 31:08.349
But an hour later, he was still talking. And also, 
normally, mother and dad would bring home a big

31:08.669 --> 31:18.019
crowd of people.
