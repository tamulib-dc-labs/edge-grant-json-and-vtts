WEBVTT

00:02.815 --> 00:13.525
At that, as a junior faculty member, you were 
expecting to stay in higher education. You

00:15.146 --> 00:16.828
weren't planning to... There was not much 
opportunity outside of educational

00:16.848 --> 00:29.920
institutions for them to follow, because most of 
that was done at educational institutions.

00:30.895 --> 00:42.531
there are a lot of commercial laboratories that do 
research even now do that a lot of it and there are

00:30.895 --> 00:42.531
some contract laboratories and they they do this. 
Now when did you first remember getting

00:43.833 --> 00:49.020
acquainted with Alvin Price? Alvin Price was an 
assistant

00:51.424 --> 00:56.751
professor in anatomy. Of course, he graduated 
after I left, and it was only after I came back here

00:58.064 --> 01:05.352
that I met him. But even in anatomy, my 
relationships were with, at that time then, were

01:05.372 --> 01:10.698
with John Milliff. And I guess when he became dean, 
I became cognizant that he was there. When did he

01:19.187 --> 01:20.269
become dean? I could look that up for you. Because I 
think he was dean when I got here in 59.

01:32.051 --> 01:33.694
That could be. You

01:33.714 --> 01:40.823
better pray quickly, honey, so he doesn't hear 
you. No, no, that's all right. No. I don't remember

01:44.869 --> 01:46.071
either one. But I said, now he's one that would be a 
wonderful person to interview. Oh, see, that's

01:51.018 --> 01:55.786
what I regret, yes. Because he could have given you 
lots of information. Now, is he bedridden

02:00.353 --> 02:02.136
totally? No, he sits up in a chair. Okay. But he 
doesn't. That's what I understand. Al

02:11.164 --> 02:24.940
Price became dean in 1957 after Armistead 
departed. Do you recall that you all felt good

02:26.021 --> 02:29.766
about his appointment as dean? Very much so. 
Describe his style of leadership.

02:39.078 --> 02:44.125
was mature for his age, in my opinion. And of 
course, I think part of that, he had, and I think

02:44.205 --> 02:52.256
Earl Rutter picked him. And Al had been an infantry 
officer in World War II, Colonel. And he had some of

02:58.604 --> 03:06.655
that value, but he had a very congenial way of 
working with you. and letting you know he wanted

03:07.259 --> 03:09.582
something done. He said, here's your job, let's 
see it done. And I remember one time I had an animal

03:14.550 --> 03:31.715
laboratory above his office and the students 
would get too much water down there and it would

03:14.550 --> 03:31.715
come through on him and he got a hold of me and he 
says, you stop that. If you don't, I'm going to take

03:31.995 --> 03:36.422
care of it.

03:37.077 --> 03:45.607
But he was very, as you say, a very capable manager 
and a leader. And so you all respected him highly? I

03:48.831 --> 03:49.632
did, yes. And I think everybody did. When did the 
vet school move west of the tracks? Was it about the

03:56.961 --> 03:58.743
time he became dean? 1958, I

03:59.705 --> 04:05.011
believe. Okay. 58, 57 or 8. Did you faculty members 
get to have any part in planning the new

04:09.026 --> 04:14.475
facilities? Yes. I got together the information 
department, and I had the incinerator and what

04:18.180 --> 04:35.046
they just found out, a duct made 5 billion dollars 
to build a new one. Then we designed the whole

04:35.650 --> 04:45.665
second floor of the medical

04:35.650 --> 04:45.665
building, the other one for the science. I thought 
we designed the whole second floor of that for our

04:47.187 --> 04:53.516
laboratories and operations. And of course, we 
had the architect change some of our design. Were

05:00.086 --> 05:02.329
you all pleased with those facilities? Oh, very 
much so. others were jealous of them and we were

05:04.422 --> 05:09.328
just fortunate that we needed space. We had a very 
strong program at that time. Would nationally the

05:14.574 --> 05:21.562
program in pathology was becoming known? Very 
much so. Yeah, I think we were one of the top

05:24.125 --> 05:26.667
programs. Who were the other among the top 
programs at that time? Cornell had historically

05:33.953 --> 05:37.257
has had an excellent program. And Washington 
State at that time had a strong program for

05:37.278 --> 05:44.567
research. And

05:44.587 --> 05:52.178
Michigan also had a good, strong program. The 
others I think were respectable, but I thought we

05:52.218 --> 05:58.486
had probably one of the better ones we had. When I, 
my last year I think we had 15 or 16 Ph.D. students

06:03.620 --> 06:12.528
when veterinary medicine was pretty strong, 
surely. Now, when you all first moved over there,

06:12.548 --> 06:25.341
late 50s, what were the other strong programs in 
veterinary medicine other than pathology? I

06:26.201 --> 06:29.825
think microbiology had a strong program. They had 
not developed their Ph.D. program. And as I

06:33.134 --> 06:41.913
remember, we were about the only one that had 
anything of any strength at that time. Those all

06:42.795 --> 06:44.278
came on later. Who were the most highly respected 
faculty members in the other departments?

06:59.493 --> 07:01.556
You're talking about other than department 
heads? Yeah. Who would have been known

07:03.318 --> 07:04.861
nationally? Oh, I see what you mean. Well, the 
people in microbiology were known primarily for

07:07.865 --> 07:15.997
their disease programs. Who were they? Charles 
Hall, and there were others that were through

07:17.038 --> 07:27.373
there, but those two name was there, I think. John 
Dell played before that. John Leland succeeded

07:31.702 --> 07:35.268
him after he died. And

07:36.771 --> 07:49.395
what about any of the other departments, 
nationally known scholars?

07:55.265 --> 07:58.389
Well, Millet, honey, from anatomy was pretty well 
known, wasn't he? Millet was known, but he was

07:58.409 --> 08:02.835
known as a teacher, as a pathologist. But in our 
practice, he was a grandfathered into the

08:04.277 --> 08:12.347
American College of Endopathy. But they didn't 
have a graduate program.

08:21.218 --> 08:50.432
as you look back now on the veterinary medicine 
medical curriculum at that time were there any

08:21.218 --> 08:50.432
things that were getting too much attention and 
were there any topics getting too little

08:21.218 --> 08:50.432
attention in the veterinary curriculum at that 
time as we know that's a matter of opinion and uh i

08:21.218 --> 08:50.432
felt uh very strongly Yes, I do, even in primary 
education today, that there are certain things

08:50.598 --> 08:58.126
that are most important, reading and writing. 
Okay. And in medicine, I think that the anatomy,

08:59.007 --> 09:06.275
pathology, and physiology are the foundations. 
Okay. Which are on basis for everything else. And I

09:11.340 --> 09:18.748
think that when you decide what you're going to 
study, both diseases and rat diseases and and do

09:19.235 --> 09:23.419
all these, you divide the person's attention, 
which they cannot do. However, the human mind has

09:23.440 --> 09:30.027
strengths that can overcome this. I think, yes, I 
think that the students are overwhelmed. And some

09:35.913 --> 09:42.920
of the Canadian schools recognize this, and they 
were strong in basics. And in fact, they were

09:44.062 --> 09:49.107
stronger in basics in a lot of their clinical 
efforts were not, well they figured they could

09:49.593 --> 09:53.178
learn that. That's an applications type thing. 
What that's again is a matter of opinion. If you're

10:00.807 --> 10:13.744
teaching public health, and veterinarians are 
very heavy now in public health, and advisories

10:00.807 --> 10:13.744
and things like that, that person is going to say 
well that's important. in the late 50s early 60s

10:14.635 --> 10:43.140
among the students in veterinary medicine how 
many of them hope to be in large animal what

10:14.635 --> 10:43.140
percentage or small animal what was the breakdown 
then

10:14.635 --> 10:43.140
well i think in those days uh there i i would 
hesitate to say i would say at least 50 50. okay now

10:14.635 --> 10:43.140
they're there i i think this could be documented 
But I don't have those pictures. Were there many

10:46.638 --> 10:52.486
who were looking primarily toward public health 
in that era? Not many, no. A lot of them got into

10:54.809 --> 11:10.850
public health because if they had a service 
obligation, they would go into veterinary

10:54.809 --> 11:10.850
training programs and services would send them to 
public health schools. A lot of them went to Tulane

11:10.870 --> 11:13.954
or places like that. and out of the service because 
the service wouldn't allow them to do those

11:14.491 --> 11:20.117
things. You became department head when? 1960. 
1960. All right. As you become department head,

11:24.883 --> 11:32.331
what did you find were the primary 
responsibilities of being a department head?

11:34.393 --> 11:43.063
Well, it was the direction of the program and 
basically is defining people to do the work. and

11:43.955 --> 12:03.443
that was a problem at that time because when Hilton 
left

11:43.955 --> 12:03.443
there was not a heavy component of strong 
pathology there. I mean the people that had

12:04.144 --> 12:10.553
advanced training And the level that I was 
concerned that it should have been a university

12:10.887 --> 12:16.392
level for people to teach others. How many PhDs 
were in the department then? You were the only one?

12:22.237 --> 12:23.558
And the faculty was how many?

12:29.463 --> 12:31.585
I think four or five. And did Dean Price, when he 
appointed you, did he give you any instructions,

12:31.846 --> 12:40.253
any guidance, any directions?

12:43.287 --> 12:46.750
I don't remember that he dictated anything.

12:50.054 --> 12:56.100
He said, he expressed that he wanted to see it 
develop, and he said, can I help? And I think he

12:57.962 --> 13:09.193
respected the program and the needs, and

12:57.962 --> 13:09.193
I don't remember anything Now you served how many 
years? 17.

13:15.720 --> 13:20.886
As you were starting out, did you turn to any of the 
other department heads for advice?

13:26.053 --> 13:27.635
Don't remember any of them doing so. I've had 
discussions, but if you know men, men will get

13:28.476 --> 13:34.984
information by not asking us what should I do. Who 
became your closest friends? One of the closest

13:41.607 --> 13:53.822
relationships was where there was a parallel,

13:41.607 --> 13:53.822
say, a friendship because we hunted together. It 
was J.D. McCready. And part of that I saw myself

13:56.325 --> 14:02.613
because I was trying to develop research 
programs. And the big thing then was

14:03.735 --> 14:10.483
collaborative, which works fine to a certain 
extent. But some people don't want to

14:11.645 --> 14:15.009
collaborate. A lot of them look at a pathologist 
being like, can you read this slide for me and tell

14:15.870 --> 14:20.937
me what it is and I'll report it. And some of that is 
that, but there are others that work with us. So we

14:25.663 --> 14:30.749
would seek out those kinds of things and try to work 
them out. Make believe that I was not acquainted

14:31.590 --> 14:35.355
with this man McCready. Describe him.

14:44.602 --> 14:51.891
What was his specialty, and what was his normal 
operating procedure?

14:54.735 --> 15:00.763
He was a very extroverted person. And as I see him, 
and

15:01.764 --> 15:12.718
very capable of being a good politician, and 
friendly to most anybody. And he had a lot of good

15:13.812 --> 15:20.100
contacts because of his association with the 
medical school at Baylor. And his department?

15:24.066 --> 15:24.967
Physiology. He was supposed to be in physiology. 
And he had some very good people with him. And he had

15:31.256 --> 15:38.185
a very large program because they taught a lot of 
students. Was he department head when you became

15:38.205 --> 15:40.588
department head? No. When

15:42.466 --> 15:55.220
I became department head, I was a junior person, 
and I perceived that I was thought to be so. Did you

15:57.483 --> 16:00.466
department heads meet regularly with Dean Price? 
Yes, he had department meetings. Describe one of

16:04.171 --> 16:05.332
those. What was a typical meeting like?

16:10.040 --> 16:12.502
Well, I don't know how to say that. They would, he 
would basically have an agenda. He would call, you

16:16.627 --> 16:25.555
know, have a meeting to order and he would present 
things to be looked at and he would start a

16:16.627 --> 16:25.555
discussion. And from that, ordinarily, he would 
make a decision. Occasionally, he would ask for a

16:32.622 --> 16:37.347
vote, which I thought was not a very smart thing to 
do. That's just a bunch of opinions. Was he always

16:42.891 --> 16:45.194
bound by the majority vote? No, I don't think so, in 
my opinion. I don't think he was. I think he did his

16:50.379 --> 16:54.203
own, you know, made up his own mind. Yeah, he was 
pretty smart, too. But did you ever feel that it was

16:59.168 --> 17:07.637
to your disadvantage not to be candid with him? I 
don't think I'd not want to be candid with him.

17:12.075 --> 17:12.776
That's what I thought. That's the answer I 
thought.

17:17.603 --> 17:24.134
He didn't mind telling me what he thought, but he 
was also always very polite. It's just amazing.

17:25.496 --> 17:35.211
Among

17:25.496 --> 17:35.211
the other department heads, who were your 
favorite associates?

17:39.292 --> 17:47.360
I would say that there were not any such thing 
except the Leland drum, which now went back a long

17:39.292 --> 17:47.360
ways. He and I were reared that five miles each 
time. And among the department heads, seven,

17:52.305 --> 17:55.028
eight? I think it was seven most of the time.

18:02.616 --> 18:08.522
And when you became a department head, was there 
anyone who was the senior senior? that had been

18:09.127 --> 18:11.209
there a long, long time? Well, of course, Pat Burns 
had been there longer than anybody. Okay. But Pat

18:17.456 --> 18:26.245
Burns was a very quiet individual and soft-spoken 
and not outspoken. Dick Turk was probably the most

18:26.346 --> 18:36.096
outgoing and you might say influential type of 
person because of his He let his opinion be known.

18:39.786 --> 18:48.799
As

18:39.786 --> 18:48.799
department head, what was your style within your 
department? Did you have faculty meetings

18:48.859 --> 18:50.762
regularly? We had faculty meetings, and we would 
discuss things, and seldom did I ask for a vote. I

19:02.219 --> 19:04.783
asked for opinions. Because I found that if you ask 
somebody's opinion and you don't respect it, then

19:05.270 --> 19:12.961
you begin to erode your support. And you have to 
maintain your support for them by individual

19:14.623 --> 19:23.715
discussions. That's my opinion. I guess I'm old 
school. Do you remember any examples of where your

19:27.393 --> 19:35.986
opinion and what you thought was the majority of 
the department's opinion were different? Can you

19:36.907 --> 19:37.748
think of any?

19:47.563 --> 19:49.726
Nothing comes to mind right now. What were some of 
the most important decisions that you and the

19:49.746 --> 19:56.556
department made during all the years you were 
department head?

20:04.619 --> 20:06.941
That's very hard to answer. We had a program where

20:06.961 --> 20:34.626
I tried to get over to each individual faculty 
member, do your best, develop something, become

20:06.961 --> 20:34.626
known, remember that you, the department's going 
to be made up with you and your colleagues, and his

20:06.961 --> 20:34.626
reputation will be based on the community, and 
then I'll support, I'll try to help you. I had to

20:37.340 --> 20:43.730
make decisions that they didn't like, 
reassigning the laboratories and things like

20:37.340 --> 20:43.730
that. I had one in tears one time, but he's now a dean 
of the Air Corps in Connecticut, I believe it is.

20:56.849 --> 21:02.638
And those things like that, I guess that

21:06.145 --> 21:07.987
I was the decision-maker.

21:09.988 --> 21:14.673
And were you the key person in selecting new 
faculty for the department? Yes. Who are some of

21:16.915 --> 21:19.457
the faculty you're proud that you hire?

21:24.061 --> 21:28.545
Well, Ken Pierce was a very capable individual. 
Make believe I don't know him, and tell me about

21:28.565 --> 21:35.832
him.

21:37.735 --> 21:47.287
a very serious, quiet, no funny business type of 
person that is very professional.

21:48.509 --> 21:49.510
He...

21:51.693 --> 21:58.121
I would like people in categories and several of 
the faculty that I could put into categories. Some

21:58.161 --> 22:02.466
of the people are so introverted that they never 
get anything done. So many people are so

22:02.486 --> 22:05.430
extroverted they never get anything done. and the 
people that make progress are in between. Ken was

22:10.995 --> 22:15.439
just a little bit on the middle, below the middle. 
He was more introverted, but he was very safe.

22:20.725 --> 22:22.847
Quality of his work was so good. Where did you first 
kind of identify him? Where did you? Well, in the

22:28.693 --> 22:32.717
days when Ken came, we were trying to build a power. 
And he was one of the first that came in. He had been

22:37.104 --> 22:38.687
teaching on anatomy. And he'd gone out and said he 
needed to do some practice. So he went out and he

22:43.314 --> 22:45.417
wanted to come back. So I interviewed him for an 
opportunity in pathology. Did he contact you or

22:49.543 --> 22:52.247
you contact him? I don't remember exactly how that 
came. I think I did not know without his. his

23:01.182 --> 23:03.865
innocent pathology. I think, basically, it may be 
that Hilton had somewhere had some contact with

23:04.826 --> 23:11.133
him. Because wouldn't he have been among the first 
faculty you hired? Yes. He would have been one of

23:16.439 --> 23:19.002
the strengths. Did he do his doctoral degree here? 
Yes. With you? Yes. I was his major professor. You

23:25.489 --> 23:26.230
were his chairman? I'll tell you a story that I 
don't really know. But I did him wrong. You don't

23:31.220 --> 23:32.621
want it on tape? No. Let's turn this back on now. A 
few things about leadership. You want people to

23:39.287 --> 23:44.072
want to do what you want done. And this is the 
essence of it. And this is what's happening in this

23:48.736 --> 23:51.218
area that you're talking about. People are going 
out with joyous things. And that's the thing where

23:55.822 --> 23:59.826
the big congregations are very developing. 
that's what they're doing. They're not depending

24:01.664 --> 24:04.167
on, you ought to do this. That's right. Kind of the 
thing of the old groups. How did you encourage that

24:07.951 --> 24:12.095
philosophy in the department? Well, we had a, 
there is a strong, there was a strong spirit of code

24:12.616 --> 24:24.328
in the department, and we felt like we And I always 
told them that you should know as much about

24:24.848 --> 24:39.345
veterinary medicine and diseases as anybody, 
even including the clinicians, except that you

24:24.848 --> 24:39.345
don't have to mess with the clients. And you are 
supposed to be academically, or you're supposed

24:40.426 --> 24:48.596
to have the answers to know and be able to solve 
problems. And people should come to you and you

24:49.737 --> 24:52.881
should be prepared that he would come to you for 
answers, which people want to do, a pathologist.

24:58.598 --> 25:00.520
They say, well, here, I've got a problem. Help me. 
Tell me about it. And we developed a very strong

25:02.922 --> 25:05.905
disparity core. And there is a very strong 
certifying group of American College of

25:06.025 --> 25:14.993
Endocrine Pathologists. And people know that 
they need to aspire

25:15.013 --> 25:22.800
to pass their exams. and the county would have been 
dependent upon each other to learn. And we were

25:28.192 --> 25:39.728
proud of our department, and I'm a little 
concerned that that's been hurt a little bit by the

25:28.192 --> 25:39.728
amalgamation of the groups and taken out of the 
way. For example, they no longer have parties

25:39.768 --> 25:51.184
together

25:39.768 --> 25:51.184
as individuals, and people want to be identified. 
They, like the cadets, their companies are the

25:51.535 --> 25:59.587
sole, their sole arrangement. And then... All 
right, as department head, did you all have social

26:00.208 --> 26:06.738
events as a department? We'd have people... Quite 
a few. Ken continued that at some. And later others

26:12.005 --> 26:15.130
came in that dropped in. i think it is hurt a while 
ago we were talking and you were saying ken you were

26:16.510 --> 26:44.610
proud to have brought him here are there some 
others that you want to mention well there's one

26:16.510 --> 26:44.610
right now that is jewel and that's gary adams gary 
adams and he told me yesterday he's been he's been

26:16.510 --> 26:44.610
over promotion but he doesn't know where he wants 
to accept did you now did you bring him here He was my

26:45.198 --> 26:46.440
graduate student. Oh, your graduate student, 
okay. And then he stayed. And he stayed, yeah.

26:52.709 --> 27:06.228
During your time as department head, were there 
any major research efforts in which the

26:52.709 --> 27:06.228
department was involved that you're proud to 
claim that they all were part of it? We were

27:08.091 --> 27:13.078
participating in a lot of research programs. And 
we had our own, and each individual had programs

27:13.885 --> 27:24.937
that many of them were sponsored by the National 
Institutes of Health. I had, I was program

27:24.957 --> 27:37.191
director of a public health, a U.S. public health, 
National Institutes of Health Training and

27:24.957 --> 27:37.191
Medical Pathology, which was well respected. And 
that went for 10 years until we finally phased

27:37.211 --> 27:43.057
those programs out. We did, research on quite a few 
things and try to solve problems. The some others

27:48.647 --> 28:12.192
in collaboration with others, I tell told 
somebody, and now in my age in my position, I tell

27:48.647 --> 28:12.192
them if you want to see anything, the impact, the 
impact of our research, I said you go to now to

27:48.647 --> 28:12.192
Lexington, Kentucky, you'll see that the all the 
board fences are painted black. And the essence of

28:14.618 --> 28:27.378
that was the research that I did to find that the 
young foals were licking the fences and getting

28:14.618 --> 28:27.378
zinc from that. From the white paint. From the 
white paint. And that inhibited the absorption of

28:33.548 --> 28:38.796
copper, which they were getting very little from 
milk to start with. And the joints fell apart.

28:42.918 --> 28:46.923
peeled off, the carcass peeled off. Did that 
affect the thoroughbred horses more than any

28:47.423 --> 28:51.368
other breeds? Mainly because thoroughbred 
horses were the horses that were kept in the fancy

28:51.628 --> 28:58.477
fences. Oh, in the fancy fences. The Kleberg 
Foundation funded this.

29:08.809 --> 29:12.874
Bubba Wattuck told me not too long ago, he said, 
that building ought to be named for you She said,

29:13.850 --> 29:17.034
they sponsored that because of your work. And so I 
feel good about that, and we did. Other examples

29:23.181 --> 29:24.783
like that? We worked on... What was that grass 
business, honey? We worked on, yeah, there's a

29:32.693 --> 29:40.362
photosynthesization that occurs with panicum 
grass. It's just planted commercially, I mean,

29:40.382 --> 29:43.165
intentionally. particularly for sheep, they're 
grazing that. And they develop this, eat this

29:47.115 --> 29:51.019
panicament. Sometimes they do, sometimes they 
don't. But the young lambs particularly develop

29:52.981 --> 30:05.993
photosensitization, which really results from 
their liver being

29:52.981 --> 30:05.993
damaged by crystals of this saponin. The saponin 
is a common component of plants.

30:13.047 --> 30:19.695
This stuff precipitates in there, and it has a 
chemical structure very similar to cholesterol.

30:19.715 --> 30:30.189
And the liver, because it is an analog of 
cholesterol, the liver handles it to a certain

30:19.715 --> 30:30.189
point, and then it precipitates in the bile ducts. 
And that plugs them up, and then they retain the

30:30.209 --> 30:41.603
porphyrins, which come from plants also, 
circulates through the blood, and into the skin,

30:30.209 --> 30:41.603
and the sun gets on that and activates it. and it 
caused their skin to slow. And we worked that out to

30:44.982 --> 30:48.927
find out why this particular plant is. Of course, 
nothing has happened from that other than they

30:49.528 --> 30:55.437
could either plant the stuff or not plant it. There 
was a chance for them to, if they wanted, if it was

30:55.457 --> 31:11.421
important enough that somebody could take the 
plant and develop some that had less saponins or do

30:55.457 --> 31:11.421
find out when sheep would be more successful. 
There are things like that that we did, and that is

31:11.738 --> 31:24.472
to work on identifying mycotic diseases of horses 
particularly and others that are unique

31:11.738 --> 31:24.472
diseases. Did y'all ever do anything...
