00:02.039 --> 00:11.695
This is an interview with General K. Hazell, 
H-A-L-S-E-L-L. Today's date is the 17th of

00:02.039 --> 00:11.695
September, 1981. This is Terry Anderson. This is a 
test.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.469
Let's start off. This is an interview with greater 
General Okay, also, and today is the 17th of

00:23.572 --> 00:28.318
September 1981. Let's talk about your parents 
first. Let's start with your family background.

00:33.505 --> 00:35.587
Can you tell us about that? Well, my father and 
mother, who both died at the age of 82, my father was

00:35.607 --> 00:51.908
originally born in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and 
came to protecting Waco in a covered wagon. Do you

00:59.727 --> 01:04.014
remember approximately when that was? Before the 
turn of the century. It was, I'm sure, a very young

01:06.538 --> 01:09.041
man. Very

01:09.061 --> 01:12.627
young. My mother was born in Jefferson,

01:12.647 --> 01:20.038
Texas, and we courted and met her in Waco.

01:24.271 --> 01:29.478
I have a sister who is deceased. That was the extent 
of my immediate family. What did your father do for

01:31.921 --> 01:34.986
occupation? For many, many years, he was in the 
printing business. As a young man, he started out

01:41.775 --> 01:50.447
as a plucky with Hill Printing Company in Waco. In 
fact, I had and I cannot find them. an annual that he

01:55.220 --> 02:13.022
printed of Texas A&M

01:55.220 --> 02:13.022
and

01:55.220 --> 02:13.022
TCU when it was at Waco in 1903.

02:13.042 --> 02:17.648
Then he continued in the printing business. I was 
born in Dallas, Texas. October the 17th, 1913, 30

02:21.663 --> 02:30.713
days from now. Within six months of my birth, we 
moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where he was

02:30.733 --> 02:50.235
branch manager of a very old and very fine firm 
that's still in business with home office in

02:30.733 --> 02:50.235
Chicago called Barnhart Brothers in Spindler. Is 
that printing also? As a matter of fact, printing

02:53.258 --> 03:01.727
and presses, type,

02:53.258 --> 03:01.727
those things. And then we returned to Dallas, 
where he was branch manager of a firm that's no

03:01.747 --> 03:13.780
longer in business, known as Millersaw Trimmer 
Company. They make feeders, envelope cutters.

03:18.426 --> 03:20.588
They sold type. That's things like that. As a 
matter of fact, the leading printing firm in Bryan

03:22.649 --> 03:32.585
at that time was known as Wallace Printing 
Company. There is still a Wallace Printing

03:32.605 --> 03:37.734
Company, but it's the widow of one of the sons. And 
my father was a very good friend of Marvin Wallace,

03:39.757 --> 03:46.328
the owner, because he used to call on us to travel.

03:49.396 --> 04:14.585
In 1922, he was at a convention

03:49.396 --> 04:14.585
in

03:49.396 --> 04:14.585
Cleveland when he got a wire from his brother, 
Kate, also, asking him if he'd have a chance to buy a

03:49.396 --> 04:14.585
Dodge automobile business in Bryan, Texas. Are 
you interested? And he said, I wired back two

04:15.005 --> 04:15.926
words, hell yes. And that's how we came to Bryan. 
and then and then uh he was a half partner with with

04:19.602 --> 04:45.778
your with his brother his brother in the 
automotive that's right i was named after my uncle

04:19.602 --> 04:45.778
yeah it's very confusing because i've gone as and 
been known as chaos second all my life yet when i

04:19.602 --> 04:45.778
needed to tell me about

04:46.265 --> 05:10.686
your mother

04:46.265 --> 05:10.686
she was raised in waco her she was Her mother was 
with her when she

05:11.476 --> 05:20.204
was one year old. She was raised there, and that's 
when she met Dad. And she was a housewife

05:21.245 --> 05:33.277
all of her life.

05:33.297 --> 05:36.960
Let's make sure that we're... What kind of man was 
your father? Can you sort of describe him? He was

05:39.482 --> 05:40.183
about Five feet, seven inches tall, extremely 
wonderful personality.

05:53.030 --> 06:00.998
He was a tremendous salesman.

06:01.018 --> 06:07.825
If you'd like a story that he's told me that I 
thought was very good, went to a new town called

06:08.750 --> 06:13.876
Clovis, New Mexico. And the man had set up a 
printing

06:16.219 --> 06:21.025
firm. And he went in to see him and just solicited 
his printing business. And he said, I've already

06:27.914 --> 06:34.602
made up my mind what I'm going to buy and who I'm 
going to buy it from. And Dad said, thank God this is

06:34.622 --> 06:36.985
a free country. But he said, since you have already 
made up your mind, would you object if I looked

06:38.686 --> 06:51.462
at the list? And he said, no, not at all. And he said, 
well, I see that you're going to set up three

06:53.845 --> 07:05.540
alleys, by which he meant three printing alleys 
where the man said, yes. He said, how did you know

07:05.560 --> 07:06.781
that? He said, well, you've ordered to. type 
number six point number eight point about like

07:09.702 --> 07:38.292
three a's or three b's three c's which indicate to 
me she wanted three alleys where three printers

07:09.702 --> 07:38.292
could work all at the same time without 
interfering with each other he said yes that's

07:09.702 --> 07:38.292
right and dad said well you may not be aware but i can 
sell you type by the lug guarantee the letter count

07:09.702 --> 07:38.292
and save you a ton of money and he said i had no idea

07:43.064 --> 07:46.548
So he's a tremendous salesman. What else about 
him?

07:53.034 --> 07:54.716
Was he active in the community? Yes. In his earlier 
years, of course, he had a bad automobile accident

07:56.298 --> 08:08.430
in 1931.

08:13.237 --> 08:24.652
broke his jaw,

08:13.237 --> 08:24.652
and they were unable to find in those days, by 
limited x-rays, exactly where it was broken. And

08:24.672 --> 08:31.502
it appeared that he was not getting well, even to 
the extent of giving me a lift at the ball barracks.

08:33.264 --> 08:41.455
And finally, the dentist and the doctor combined 
x-rays and x-rays and found the break.

08:45.080 --> 08:50.808
And he sold out his interest in the business in the 
30s to his brother. Why did he do that? Oh, it was, I

08:54.593 --> 09:02.003
think, difficult for two people to make a good 
living out of the same business. And he had some

09:02.023 --> 09:04.086
rent property at the time. It was up in the years, so 
he was getting retired.

09:13.160 --> 09:16.985
How about your mother? What kind of person was she? 
She was a very loving person, and a very insecure

09:17.586 --> 09:28.139
person.

09:28.159 --> 09:38.813
To understand that, you need to have known my 
grandmother.

09:39.805 --> 09:46.193
possibly the 132nd or 164th Indian back then.

09:46.213 --> 09:54.924
But

09:46.213 --> 09:54.924
my mother's father died when she was one year old. 
And my grandma

09:54.944 --> 10:07.399
made my mother believe that if my grandmother 
didn't work, my mother would starve to death. And I

10:09.218 --> 10:13.925
think she kind of had a syndrome like they received 
bills. No matter how much money she had in the bank,

10:14.566 --> 10:21.997
she always wanted to where the next bill was coming 
from. But she was a fine, fine person, a very loving

10:22.017 --> 10:25.822
person. Who was the authority in the household? My 
father. So that's pretty much a traditional type

10:30.489 --> 10:33.533
family. Yes. Was religion at all important?

10:39.644 --> 10:43.910
More so with my mother than my father. We went, at 
least I went to Sunday

10:43.930 --> 10:50.278
school regularly. Mother and dad went 
infrequently.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.449
I went through all the usual things. I belonged to 
the Episcopal Church and was an altar boy and all

10:58.469 --> 11:07.682
of those things. It was... a factor, perhaps not a 
real strong factor,

11:09.175 --> 11:15.723
but nevertheless it was there. More so on my 
mother's side.

11:20.530 --> 11:23.954
Now you eventually became a general, which is a 
position of leadership. In what way do you think

11:23.974 --> 11:38.333
that your parents were responsible

11:23.974 --> 11:38.333
for that? That's Real difficult to say. I know my 
father was afraid of no man. Even when his jaw was

11:48.504 --> 11:54.671
broken, somebody said something one day to him, 
and he said, there's a chip on my shoulder. Would

11:54.711 --> 11:56.412
you like to try to knock it off? He was not afraid to 
say anything that he felt like. I'll give you an

12:05.302 --> 12:06.503
example. My former partner, Obie Donahue, was a 
salesman for Dad

12:08.575 --> 12:21.034
earlier.

12:21.054 --> 12:28.326
And he said that year that Dodge trucks were the 
sorries that you ever laid your eyes on. And he said

12:28.346 --> 12:35.477
a factory truck man came down and he said we called 
on everybody that was even thinking about buying a

12:28.346 --> 12:35.477
truck. And the answer was no. And he said, on the way 
back, I told the man that he's just going to have to

12:40.343 --> 12:49.279
start building a better truck if he wants to sell 
something.

12:49.299 --> 12:56.452
So when they got back, the man went in to Dad and 
said, I want you to fire that salesman. And Dad

12:56.472 --> 12:59.458
said, where's your money? He said, what do you 
mean, where's my money? Well, he said, if you're

13:02.828 --> 13:09.416
going to tell me how to run my business, it looks 
like you ought to have an investment in it. He says,

13:09.436 --> 13:13.581
you sound like you'd like some contract cases. He 
said, it's in the safe. Do you want me to get it out?

13:17.987 --> 13:23.434
He said, the man there ran

13:17.987 --> 13:23.434
it. He was good with people, but he was wrong. But in 
the early years... I never saw my father except

13:31.786 --> 13:47.000
when he came in on the train on Friday night or 
Saturday morning and left Sunday night because he

13:31.786 --> 13:47.000
traveled by train.

13:47.020 --> 13:56.970
So my discipline was an ivory back hairbrush from 
my mother. And then I did bad the time Dad got home.

14:01.958 --> 14:09.506
How

14:01.958 --> 14:09.506
much education

14:01.958 --> 14:09.506
did your parents have? Not very much. My father 
always remarked that he would love to have gone

14:11.369 --> 14:29.569
farther, but in the seventh grade

14:11.369 --> 14:29.569
he said he was minding his own business.

14:30.173 --> 15:00.113
boy behind him threw a spitball

14:30.173 --> 15:00.113
and the teacher came up for the ruler and whacked 
him across the shoulder and he said i closed my book

14:30.173 --> 15:00.113
and hit her in the face and he said my last day of 
school was a superintendent and i was the

14:30.173 --> 15:00.113
principal in the classroom and i was running 
around throwing chalk at him as i went around got

14:30.173 --> 15:00.113
the door and went out and He always regretted

15:02.185 --> 15:07.430
that he never had more education. But in those 
days, seventh grade education was fairly good.

15:15.938 --> 15:18.901
Let me check the call. OK, let's talk about your 
education. All right. I entered Texas A&M. Let's

15:26.408 --> 15:27.990
start before Texas A&M. Let's start with your 
early education.

15:33.961 --> 15:37.806
I went to kindergarten in Dallas, Texas. We lived 
in the Oak Cliff section, which is now all colored.

15:45.016 --> 16:01.960
I attended the first grade and second grade of 
Winnetka Elementary School, and I had started in

15:45.016 --> 16:01.960
the third grade,

15:45.016 --> 16:01.960
and we moved to Bryan about

16:07.306 --> 16:12.933
seven or eight days before my ninth birthday. And I 
entered the Bryan school system in third grade.

16:20.003 --> 16:32.659
And I went through elementary

16:20.003 --> 16:32.659
school and high school all in the same building, 
which is now known as Fenton School. In those days,

16:32.679 --> 16:33.921
we had through the seventh grade was elementary 
school, and high school was eighth, ninth, 10th,

16:36.517 --> 16:48.069
and 11th. And I graduated in 1931. What were your 
favorite

16:52.093 --> 16:57.879
subjects? English, history.

17:03.505 --> 17:06.068
I had some particularly excellent teachers.

17:10.064 --> 17:24.238
I can still almost to this day diagram a sentence 
which was purely from high school, not from

17:10.064 --> 17:24.238
university

17:10.064 --> 17:24.238
education. We had some excellent teachers. Were 
you in any sports or activities? Football and

17:29.584 --> 17:31.105
basketball. And then I went out for track by virtue 
of the fact that that was a way to escape physical

17:32.867 --> 17:40.054
education classes. Why did you want to escape 
those? Usually young men like those classes.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.009
Well, I just thought I'd give track for it. I think I 
had the record of running the mile in the longest

17:48.069 --> 17:52.795
time of anybody in the state. I just

17:53.436 --> 17:58.182
went out to keep. I played football and 
basketball. I wasn't very good at either sport.

18:06.393 --> 18:10.379
Did you consider yourself popular in high school? 
Did you have a lot of friends? Yes. There was not a

18:14.746 --> 18:20.415
whole lot of people in my high school. We had then, 
which is Boyd Elementary School. I'm not sure what

18:27.686 --> 18:32.333
it was called then, but that was the west side. And 
where we went to Bryan High School, which is

18:33.562 --> 18:38.651
currently Bannon, was the east side. And we used to 
have football games on the courthouse lawn.

18:47.526 --> 18:52.754
So many of my classmates are dead now. Retired 
Judge Johnny M. Barron was a classmate. He came

18:57.002 --> 18:59.586
over from the west side because his family was 
dead.

19:02.840 --> 19:07.807
One of them in California named Charles Ferguson. 
Charles and a man by the name of Sheik Wilcox

19:07.887 --> 19:28.798
and I were all

19:07.887 --> 19:28.798
the time running around together. We didn't have 
as many clubs. was in the debating team. We didn't

19:36.107 --> 19:41.954
really have a lot

19:36.107 --> 19:41.954
of clubs. It was fairly primitive back in those 
days. I lived on

19:45.698 --> 19:53.768
what is now Texas Avenue. It was in College Avenue, 
across from about where Midway Transmission is.

20:01.328 --> 20:07.035
In fact, I think that Sonic Drive-in is where my 
home was. And, of course, I walked home to lunch and

20:07.055 --> 20:17.447
walked back to school because it was only a matter 
of four or five blocks. But nearly all of my

20:18.208 --> 20:23.914
classmates did. Did you have any firm aims when you 
graduated from high school, or did you have any

20:23.934 --> 20:30.542
idea what you wanted to be or do in the future? It was 
in the real height of the Depression. Of course,

20:37.395 --> 20:41.259
the crash came in 29, the after effect. In fact, my 
dad had to take on Kelvinator refrigerators just

20:41.279 --> 20:50.751
to keep the doors

20:41.279 --> 20:50.751
open. I had no idea what I wanted to do,

20:50.771 --> 20:59.382
if there were any testing facilities.

21:01.623 --> 21:06.009
They weren't known to me. So dad suggested that I 
take engineering. I said, well, that's all right.

21:13.138 --> 21:18.085
He said, why not electrical

21:13.138 --> 21:18.085
engineering? I said, OK, that's all right, which 
is not what I wanted to do at all. And I took

21:22.731 --> 21:27.597
electrical engineering for 2 and 1 half years. We 
got into polyphase lap wound motors, and I

21:28.842 --> 21:39.037
transferred to mechanical

21:28.842 --> 21:39.037
engineering. Remember, again, it was hard, hard 
times. Electrical engineers and mechanical

21:44.265 --> 21:55.542
engineers were graduating and getting jobs in 
filling stations.

21:55.977 --> 22:03.585
My last year, I switched to agricultural 
engineering, who were getting more jobs than

21:55.977 --> 22:03.585
anybody else, and spent an extra year. And I 
graduated in 1936 with a degree in agricultural

22:05.107 --> 22:12.715
engineering. Did you ever consider any other 
university or college besides A&M?

22:21.037 --> 22:35.017
I just would like to, but

22:21.037 --> 22:35.017
I was not able to afford it. I'm not near one of my 
parents. Although, believe it or not, for four

22:38.182 --> 22:47.395
years I lived in a dormitory

22:38.182 --> 22:47.395
there, even though my home was divided. Why was 
that? In those days, the lowest form of campus

22:50.028 --> 23:13.539
existence, and we had branches in the military, 
the lowest form of existence was a day student in

22:50.028 --> 23:13.539
the signal

22:50.028 --> 23:13.539
corps. You didn't want to be a day student. So I 
lived in Denver for four years. I lived at home. Why

23:16.784 --> 23:17.545
Stanford? Why were you interested in Stanford? It 
was an excellent university, and if I was going to

23:20.150 --> 23:32.361
study engineering, I felt like they had one of the 
top engineering schools in the United States.

23:32.381 --> 23:38.366
Back in those days— Were you eager to get out of 
Bryan College Station? Were you eager to leave

23:38.386 --> 23:40.047
Texas to see something else? Maybe, maybe to a 
degree. I don't know. I just—maybe

23:44.952 --> 23:48.975
it was— figment of imagination to dream 
something. That's the only other place I ever even

23:53.645 --> 23:57.748
thought of. Did the Depression, the Depression 
sounds like it had an economic impact on your

23:57.768 --> 24:02.233
family. Did it have a political impact? I mean, was 
your family a Roosevelt supporter or? I, probably

24:11.141 --> 24:13.283
they were. I'm not sure I was too interested in 
politics. In those days, You didn't get to vote

24:20.444 --> 24:23.308
until you were 21. I remember we also paid a poll tax 
in Texas. Except on my 21st birthday, I went down to

24:28.076 --> 24:41.736
the courthouse and got my certificate of 
eligibility to vote, and that was free.

24:41.756 --> 24:47.846
I'm not sure I, as a lot of students, were doing it in 
politics. I was pretty well wrapped up. going

24:50.431 --> 24:54.556
to school. Did your family ever accept any federal 
support during the Great Depression, or did

24:54.576 --> 25:02.825
anybody ever apply on a job? To my knowledge, there 
was no federal support. Oh, the CCCs, I'm talking

25:06.809 --> 25:08.391
about. No. A very close friend

25:10.453 --> 25:16.920
of mine was in the CCCs, a current close friend. But 
no, I went to A&M. Then they, I can't remember what

25:21.278 --> 25:39.100
year, possibly 32 or 33, they came out with what we 
call the AAA, the Agricultural Adjustment

25:21.278 --> 25:39.100
Act. And one summer I worked from, went to school 
from 10 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon, worked

25:40.922 --> 25:48.231
from 4 in the afternoon to 12 at night. The summer 
before, I surveyed acreage in the bottom.

26:02.511 --> 26:09.802
Most

26:02.511 --> 26:09.802
of those people I already knew. I walked many a mile 
around the fields. But that job was funded by the

26:10.623 --> 26:12.926
government? That's right. It paid me $3 a day. I 
worked seven days a week. Finally worked up a

26:17.489 --> 26:27.901
supervisor, $4 a day, and they stopped the 
program.

26:27.921 --> 26:33.006
What political persuasion was your family?

26:33.467 --> 26:34.949
Democratic. Yeah, everybody's Democratic in 
Texas. At that time, were they conservatives,

26:38.012 --> 26:41.776
moderates, liberals? Terry, I'm not sure. 
Probably conservative.

26:52.365 --> 27:03.662
Our political system in Bryan, we had a man, and he 
was a friend of Dad's, and he later became a rather

26:52.365 --> 27:03.662
good friend of mine. He was an attorney named Law 
Henderson. And I think Henderson Elementary

27:09.471 --> 27:12.876
School was named after him. He was attorney for the 
city of Bryan, and he was attorney for Bryan

27:14.813 --> 27:24.265
Building and Home. And he was the, I would say, the 
political czar of Brazos County. Nobody ran for

27:34.078 --> 27:40.426
office and got elected without his approval. And 
yet he was a fine person. And I used to kid him

27:43.838 --> 27:50.727
because he smoked cigars for many years, and he 
quit. He kept one stuck in his mouth. And I used to

27:54.051 --> 27:55.093
kid him. I said, Mr. Law, you're the only man I know 
with an unlighted chew of the back of

27:55.213 --> 28:04.405
your mouth. But I liked him very much. But he was a 
powerful

28:05.667 --> 28:10.834
politician. And what political persuasion are 
you following? I'm a conservative, very

28:12.543 --> 28:20.814
conservative

28:12.543 --> 28:20.814
Democrat. Very conservative. Now, when you went 
to A&M, did you ever consider the military aspect

28:21.215 --> 28:26.062
of A&M? Was that at all important? Or was it 
basically because of the engineering? Yes, I

28:32.651 --> 28:33.652
think so. I think so. Of course, in those days, The 
only people that were not in the Corps were either

28:40.420 --> 28:53.974
athletes or

28:40.420 --> 28:53.974
physically unqualified. So it was just a matter of 
course going to the Corps. Of course, you

28:59.720 --> 29:06.006
remember- Did that draw you, or did you have any 
feelings about being in the Corps or not being in

28:59.720 --> 29:06.006
the Corps? I just assumed that was part of it. As a 
matter of fact, I was in the registration line, and

29:09.631 --> 29:19.907
the seniors from the various outfits were there. 
And

29:20.107 --> 29:25.174
one of them said, what outfit are you going to get 
in? I said, I don't know. He said, well, get in the

29:26.216 --> 29:28.159
Calvary. I said, all right.

29:31.965 --> 29:36.111
So farther down the line, there was another 
senior, and he said, What outfit you gonna get in? I

29:39.511 --> 29:40.953
said, the Calvary, I guess. He said, what course 
you gonna take? I said, electrical engineering.

29:44.958 --> 29:50.225
He said, man, the Calvary hadn't graduated 
electrical engineering in 30 years. I said, what

29:50.245 --> 29:51.447
do you represent? He said, Battery A, field 
artillery. I said, all right, I'll get the Battery

29:55.272 --> 29:58.957
A. The next senior that came along was Battery C, 
field artillery, and he happened to be the last one

29:58.977 --> 30:07.448
I ran into, so I was in Battery C, field artillery.

30:11.579 --> 30:21.191
Did you ever consider applying to one of the 
service academies?

30:21.211 --> 30:36.150
I thought about it, but not

30:21.211 --> 30:36.150
probably real rigorously.

30:36.170 --> 30:37.992
But I took to the military. What did you like about 
being on the Corps? Cam ready, friendship. I had a

30:48.842 --> 30:51.166
ball as a freshman. In those days, we'd cut our hair 
short. We had a white stripe around our cup. Do they

30:58.096 --> 30:59.097
still have that? No. A freshman had many 
privileges you might not be aware of. For example?

31:06.869 --> 31:09.092
We could cut in on a senior to dance. say, pardon me, 
sir, but I'd like to thank this lady. Or we could

31:11.749 --> 31:19.095
walk up to any

31:11.749 --> 31:19.095
guest young lady on campus and introduce her. I'm 
Fish Austin. She better meet you. That a ball,

31:24.420 --> 31:26.982
really. Of course, those days we had

31:27.002 --> 31:32.686
boards. Yeah. Tell me about the hazing. Well, I 
went out for freshman football. Mind you, I

31:38.151 --> 31:39.332
would... What, 145, 150 pounds. And I

31:42.675 --> 31:52.506
was a center and linebacker in high school. I ended 
up as a third string quarterback, which is meat

31:52.526 --> 32:01.015
grinding.

32:01.035 --> 32:04.760
And we had what was known then as a frog. You ever 
hear of a frog?

32:08.607 --> 32:14.456
A frog was an individual that started mid-term. So 
he had to play freshman football the following

32:14.476 --> 32:17.841
year. He wasn't a fish, he was a frog. And they'd 
open up a line, and I'd dash through it, and there's

32:21.706 --> 32:33.724
a big old boy, and he'd pick me up, flap me like that, 
and the ball would go that way, and the helmet that

32:21.706 --> 32:33.724
way.

32:33.824 --> 32:36.708
How long did you last play football? I played 
through the whole year. On the third string, of

32:39.927 --> 32:46.556
course, that was way down the line. That was, well, 
I'd say it was a cannon fodder. But I enjoyed it. Did

32:51.623 --> 32:53.706
you play any after that? No, only intramural. I 
played

32:57.791 --> 33:02.698
intramural. And intramural softball. And your 
work? Work was primarily in the summertime. But

33:10.454 --> 33:15.702
not during the school year?

33:15.722 --> 33:15.782
No. And yet you still had enough money to be able to 
live on campus and not work during the school year

33:15.802 --> 33:25.397
during the Depression? That's right. That was my 
mother and father's time. But

33:29.063 --> 33:34.992
money went a long way, you see. Oh, yeah. Money went 
a long way. And I guess the room and board at the

33:39.513 --> 33:49.325
university college at that time was about as cheap 
as living at home. Did you see any purpose in the

33:51.708 --> 33:57.334
hazing?

33:57.354 --> 33:57.535
Yes. What was it? Of course, it varied among 
outfits. In our

34:04.643 --> 34:08.608
battery,

34:11.626 --> 34:15.891
Only the sophomores hazed the freshmen. The 
juniors and seniors could. And in some instances,

34:18.694 --> 34:21.777
they did. But we had some unwritten rules.

34:28.224 --> 34:35.432
A sophomore or a junior could only call for a 
specific freshman to run an errand. A senior could

34:35.452 --> 34:40.738
holler freshman, and all of them would scurry. 
That first year in A&M,

34:41.056 --> 34:51.088
we had room inspections every Saturday morning. 
And I cleaned up for the battery commander and his

34:51.108 --> 35:01.501
roommate, and for the first sergeant and his 
roommate. Remember, we had very few freshmen. I

35:05.085 --> 35:06.507
think the total enrollment In 1931, total 
enrollment

35:08.680 --> 35:20.971
was around 0.5.

35:20.991 --> 35:25.135
And the battery commander was left-handed. And 
you had to assume a certain position with the

35:25.155 --> 35:32.021
testicle, handle of the testicle. And then

35:32.041 --> 35:38.687
the battery commander would strike me three or 
four times with the board, and then his roommate,

35:39.764 --> 35:46.835
who was right-handed, and they didn't want to know 
which hit the hardest. And then I had to be very

35:46.855 --> 35:56.110
delicate about how the techniques were different 
and so forth, because obviously the one that you

35:46.855 --> 35:56.110
said hit the hardest doesn't have to prove 
anything wrong. And the first sergeant, who was

35:58.133 --> 36:04.523
commonly a junior in his roommates, I would work 
Friday afternoon mopping the floor and cleaning

36:06.258 --> 36:11.606
it up. Come in Saturday morning to make the last 
touch and they'd been eating pecans and they were

36:11.626 --> 36:16.052
all over the floor. And then I found out that they 
didn't inspect the first sergeant's room. So it

36:23.783 --> 36:26.707
made it a whole lot easier. But it was, hazing was 
kind of a way of life. It wasn't done in brutality

36:31.433 --> 36:34.037
really. it was done to see a lot of people come out of 
high school big man on campus and all of that one of

36:35.722 --> 37:03.096
the things that we did i don't know whether i was 
smart enough but i was lucky enough every unit that

36:35.722 --> 37:03.096
started school each company about first sergeant 
would make an announcement Due to the shortage of

37:04.190 --> 37:15.363
non-commissioned officers, there were 
vacancies, and anybody that would like to apply

37:04.190 --> 37:15.363
for those vacancies, please step forward. So some 
freshmen stepped forward, and they were

37:15.383 --> 37:23.613
appointed everything from master sergeant to 
corporal. But they were on a probationary period,

37:23.633 --> 37:28.739
and they had to wear their stripes upside down. 
Well, they made the announcements on the PA system

37:33.788 --> 37:43.283
Sabisa Hall, big man on campus till the day of 
wreck.

37:43.303 --> 37:52.337
It was all a part of the tradition of bringing you 
into discipline. So you thought that Hastings was

37:52.357 --> 38:01.231
part of the purpose of this tradition and 
discipline? I think so. Are you sorry to see it go?

38:05.198 --> 38:07.461
It's about the only thing they have today on 
campus. No, not really. This is a different time,

38:10.265 --> 38:15.872
different time frame. I'm hard pressed to advise 
my son in many instances because the times are

38:15.892 --> 38:27.467
different. Communication is instant like that.

38:33.526 --> 38:38.533
things that occurred 30 minutes ago we were aware 
of. Not in those days. It's just a whole different

38:40.637 --> 38:42.139
ballgame. I think hazing had its place at that 
time. I do not think it does now. Was there anything

38:49.430 --> 38:51.833
that you disliked about being on the Corps? I can't 
think of a thing. I marched the mill three times a

38:55.939 --> 39:00.626
day. Many a time we had to steal food to bring it to a 
senior. Even though we had a regular army mat to

39:08.129 --> 39:16.782
start and stand at the door, it was quite a 
challenge.

39:16.802 --> 39:17.764
I loved it, really. Had a ball.

39:23.011 --> 39:27.478
Did you ever assume a position of leadership in the 
Corps? I was slated to be first sergeant of Battery

39:27.498 --> 39:31.444
City. And I failed to qualify as a junior. Poor 
grades. And the sergeant major down in the

39:41.842 --> 39:56.602
commandant's office, I'd go down there, and he 
says, there's Kay Hawson, the guy with his

39:41.842 --> 39:56.602
military future behind

39:41.842 --> 39:56.602
you. So I became a file closer to my junior year and 
my senior. And in my fifth year,

40:05.596 --> 40:15.086
I became

40:05.596 --> 40:15.086
a second lieutenant. When I came back, it was 
qualified. Let's talk about the ways in which

40:17.289 --> 40:29.021
being in the Corps helped you in your military

40:17.289 --> 40:29.021
career. Things we did were practical. To give you 
an example, if I may move forward a while. In 1941, I

40:37.357 --> 40:58.142
was a volunteer in practice duty and went to Fort 
Ord, California and was sent to a school of 7th

40:37.357 --> 40:58.142
Division artillery. Then we went to

41:02.498 --> 41:14.068
Camp Roberts, California, which was an IRTC, 
Infra-Replacement Training Center, in the West

41:02.498 --> 41:14.068
Garrison. In the East Garrison, which was 
designed for an artillery brigade, we went there

41:14.088 --> 41:30.864
to form

41:14.088 --> 41:30.864
the 26th Field Artillery Brigade.

41:30.884 --> 41:31.324
We had In our regiment, 70 officers, of which 40 
were regular army, and 30 were reserve. Many of

41:43.572 --> 41:53.181
them of which were up and down the California 
coast, San Jose State, Stanford, and various

41:43.572 --> 41:53.181
places

41:43.572 --> 41:53.181
around. They were unable to move a body of men. They 
were unable to properly salute. They really were.

42:02.337 --> 42:05.980
That was old stuff to me. In other words, the way it 
helped you was preparation. That's right.

42:10.405 --> 42:12.787
Because, see, we were horse-drawn artillery. And 
I liked horses. And we had some fine stable

42:17.331 --> 42:24.958
sergeants and army sergeants, regular army down 
there. And freshmen either rode the caisson. You

42:30.744 --> 42:32.125
know what a caisson is? a two-wheel vehicle that 
pulls the gun.

42:37.392 --> 42:46.745
Or he rides

42:37.392 --> 42:46.745
the first team. And then generally, sophomores 
ride the swing team or the lead

42:46.765 --> 42:57.300
team. There'll be three horses. And you rode on the 
left side or the near horse, and you had a horse on

42:59.155 --> 43:05.345
the other side, the off horse. As a sophomore, I was 
a lead team driver.

43:13.277 --> 43:17.724
And I had an off horse by the name of Santa Claus, I 
believe. The only time he ever, the only way he ever

43:17.744 --> 43:23.153
went out of the gun park was on his hind legs. So I had 
a barrel. Is there any way you think that being in

43:26.408 --> 43:41.029
the Corps ever hurt your advancement, hindered in 
any way your career in the military? No. I'd say it

43:41.129 --> 43:45.315
absolutely enhanced it. Has it prepared you much 
better than the average ROTC person? Yes. On the

43:50.382 --> 43:56.230
West Coast, they wore the uniform on drill day.

43:59.298 --> 44:00.720
And we lived it. We marched to meals three times a 
day in formation. We had parades and reviews.

44:12.198 --> 44:15.342
It was just a way of life. But we differed in one way 
with our

44:15.362 --> 44:24.736
military staff.

44:24.757 --> 44:26.419
A few of them that were

44:29.150 --> 44:34.557
over-anxious, I guess the wording is. We'd call 
our dormitories barracks. And every so often as

44:38.723 --> 44:48.776
they, those over-ambitious would pass by, they 
accidentally got wet out of the window.

44:49.698 --> 44:50.339
And they didn't know who did it. We harassed them. 
But we had a, you know, a closeness of spirit. We had

44:56.547 --> 44:57.368
a Well, it was the Democrats and Republicans. 
Artillery wore red hat cards on their hats.

45:07.341 --> 45:09.924
Infantry wore blue. We used to have elections they 
called hat card elections.

45:15.692 --> 45:20.097
But the Corps was really a close-knit out. Do you 
think that being in the Corps had any impact on you

45:20.117 --> 45:26.966
eventually becoming a general?

45:26.986 --> 45:29.329
I can't see how it would help.

45:31.992 --> 45:43.246
You

45:31.992 --> 45:43.246
did not become an officer until you were a senior. 
You did not become a sergeant until you were a

45:43.266 --> 45:49.434
classified junior. I became, I think, a corporal 
when I was a sophomore.

45:54.700 --> 46:01.729
Some institutions you can become a sergeant and a 
sophomore and so forth.

46:06.704 --> 46:13.330
We had what we called tactical officers. Let's 
talk about some of these. These are professional

46:16.173 --> 46:17.994
soldiers. What impact did they have on you? Quite a 
bit. When I was a freshman, I had a very fine and

46:25.582 --> 46:33.309
gentle soul by the name of Captain Tom Harris. And 
of course, remember that the Army had no money in

46:35.780 --> 46:38.784
those days. Captain Harry told me one day, he said, 
well, I see where old General so-and-so died. I

46:46.236 --> 46:50.462
went up one notch on the promotion list. And in what 
we call military science class, or we call

46:50.482 --> 47:01.939
bulletics, we were talking about the then gun, the 
French 75.
