00:03.389 --> 00:29.005
Your sense of contribution to the community

00:03.389 --> 00:29.005
is

00:03.389 --> 00:29.005
kind of rewarding, but basically it's just a lot of 
confidence-building maneuvers, because that's

00:03.389 --> 00:29.005
what we call things we did in the airplanes when you 
learn to fly, and especially in jet fighters. But

00:29.145 --> 00:32.670
it was confidence-building activities and 
leadership activities and you learn how to work

00:33.173 --> 00:52.870
with people and how to motivate people and I 
learned early on that one of the best ways to

00:33.173 --> 00:52.870
motivate people is just set a good example and be a 
good example and most time people will follow and

00:33.173 --> 00:52.870
then you don't have to use more persuasive means of 
leadership if you don't have to. And besides, if

00:59.399 --> 01:09.411
you have to use too much persuasion and 
motivation, a lot of times if you're in a voluntary

00:59.399 --> 01:09.411
type activity, you just turn to somebody else. And 
if somebody's not pulling their share or making

01:09.511 --> 01:21.085
promises that they don't keep or don't fulfill, 
you just quit depending on them and associate with

01:09.511 --> 01:21.085
people you can depend on. Let's go to academics. Do 
you remember how you registered for the first

01:25.549 --> 01:27.732
time? How'd you get into it? How did they know what 
classes for you to get that first semester?

01:40.828 --> 01:45.874
It seems like my first semester this year

01:51.254 --> 02:12.402
It seemed like we went over to Sabisa Dining Hall 
and you stood in lines at different tables

01:51.254 --> 02:12.402
representing the different departments and the 
different

01:51.254 --> 02:12.402
courses within the departments.

02:14.187 --> 02:21.998
You consulted with an academic advisor, and you 
had a card that you went through and filled out as

02:14.187 --> 02:21.998
you confirmed your different classes. And I don't 
remember much about the details other than that

02:22.960 --> 02:33.174
first semester was fairly easy because there were 
so many core classes and basic classes that you had

02:22.960 --> 02:33.174
to take. And it was just a matter of going through. 
And yours was engineering? Right. It was

02:38.682 --> 02:41.286
engineering for the first two years, right. Do you 
remember some of those first semester classes? I

02:45.811 --> 03:12.375
remember that in one of the

02:45.811 --> 03:12.375
English classes I tested out of one of the first 
composition and rhetoric classes one of the basic

02:45.811 --> 03:12.375
ones and moved to an advanced class and in one of the 
mathematics classes I tested out of one of the

03:12.541 --> 03:19.673
basic ones and got to start to tell you I had a pretty 
good academic background in Conroe. And English

03:19.693 --> 03:36.861
and math were two of the classes where I tested out 
of the first semester of the first courses.

03:37.043 --> 03:45.816
even though the classes I took were maybe a little 
more challenging than some of my contemporaries

03:37.043 --> 03:45.816
did, I was pretty well prepared for it and didn't 
have any real problems. I never was a straight A

03:45.836 --> 04:05.025
student, but my, I believe it was my second 
freshman semester, and then two other of my nine

03:45.836 --> 04:05.025
semesters, I made distinguished student. But so I 
was maybe a little above average, but not real high

04:06.406 --> 04:14.099
academically. I always had to study quite a bit. 
Things don't always come real easily. I don't have

04:21.151 --> 04:22.513
photographic memory. I don't have a real high IQ. I 
think it measured somewhere, I don't remember,

04:25.358 --> 04:32.650
somewhere between 125 and 130.

04:34.385 --> 04:48.418
I always had to study, had to do a lot of homework, 
and I found that if I did and if I was very methodical

04:34.385 --> 04:48.418
in the way I organized my studies and my note taking 
and kept up with my reading and so forth, that I

04:34.385 --> 04:48.418
could do okay. Where did you do that study? Mostly 
in my dorm room, but sometimes if there were

04:51.175 --> 05:04.627
activities and I knew that there were some turmoil 
or something going on in the dorm that would be

04:51.175 --> 05:04.627
distracting, I'd go to the library or maybe to the 
MSC. Did you have special little places you found

05:05.748 --> 05:08.691
in those two? Yeah, in the library, a lot of times 
you'd be okay just in one of the big public study

05:09.732 --> 05:19.461
desks. but then later on when you were really in a 
crunch and really had to concentrate there were

05:19.660 --> 05:47.457
little cubicles up in the stacks where you could 
you could check out a number of books and you didn't

05:19.660 --> 05:47.457
have to check them out you could just get the books 
off the stacks once you learn the Dewey Decimal

05:19.660 --> 05:47.457
System and how to find them you could get the books 
you wanted you might have eight or ten books on a

05:19.660 --> 05:47.457
shelf above the little cubicle and you could sit 
there and then as you needed references or

05:19.660 --> 05:47.457
bibliography or something you could pull them out 
of the books and you could sit there and write a term

05:47.858 --> 05:54.929
paper and then you didn't even have to complete it 
in that sitting. You could leave it and then just

05:55.610 --> 06:11.453
put a note on the desk occupied and put your name on 
it and nobody would bother it and then I think there

05:55.610 --> 06:11.453
was a time limit of two or three weeks or something 
like that. If you hadn't finished your paper then

06:11.514 --> 06:15.840
you might come back and find that your books had 
been put back on the shelves in the stacks, and

06:16.242 --> 06:29.728
you'd have to go back and get them, put them back 
out, but most of the time when you got back there,

06:16.242 --> 06:29.728
your books were still right there, and so you'd 
just bring your notebook or your papers and

06:16.242 --> 06:29.728
continue where you left off. That was a real good 
system. If you were under stress or you just needed

06:35.510 --> 06:45.165
to get away, sometimes you could use that as an 
excuse and just go up there and put your head on the

06:35.510 --> 06:45.165
desk and take a nap. Where in the MSC did you study?

06:53.806 --> 07:18.261
down in the student programs areas, well 
sometimes there were meeting rooms that were

06:53.806 --> 07:18.261
unoccupied and unlocked that you could get into or 
even if they were locked, if you asked somebody, a

06:53.806 --> 07:18.261
lot of times, especially since I was known as an 
active participant and a committee member,

06:53.806 --> 07:18.261
you could get a key or get somebody to unlock one for 
you and then you just lock it when you left. Did you

07:19.135 --> 07:26.567
have early on some classes and or instructors that 
were meaningful to you later?

07:32.496 --> 07:33.057
Let's see. I'm trying

07:33.097 --> 07:46.898
to remember who taught the, there was one of the 
classes called and effective discourse,

07:47.468 --> 08:14.573
and I'm trying to remember who taught that, but 
that was one of my favorites, not only because it

07:47.468 --> 08:14.573
taught methodical logic, taught the difference 
between inductive and deductive, or subjective

07:47.468 --> 08:14.573
and objective reasoning, And that's where I 
learned to appreciate the search for truth and the

08:15.481 --> 08:38.738
distinction between learning

08:15.481 --> 08:38.738
for the sake of wisdom and learning for the sake of 
manipulating the system where you learn the

08:15.481 --> 08:38.738
difference between truth and propaganda. And 
whereas in an academic situation, the classic

08:39.528 --> 09:09.248
reason for a debate is for two sides to vigorously 
explore the pros and cons, with the outcome being

08:39.528 --> 09:09.248
to discover truths and fundamental principles of 
life that everybody can live by and help everybody

08:39.528 --> 09:09.248
improve themselves, in authoritarian systems, 
the purpose of a debate is for one person to

09:10.460 --> 09:31.877
annihilate their opponent and truth matters very 
little and that became reinforced to me and became

09:10.460 --> 09:31.877
very important to me a little bit later in life when 
I had another little experience where I had to deal

09:10.460 --> 09:31.877
with propaganda from a position of weakness for a 
number of years and yet that class helped sustain

09:32.701 --> 09:57.932
me considerably and that class especially 
combined with my Judeo-Christian background I

09:32.701 --> 09:57.932
was a born-again Christian Southern Baptist I'd 
probably be what a lot of the PC crowd call a

09:32.701 --> 09:57.932
fundamentalist nowadays but evangelical 
Christian made a profession of faith when I was 10,

09:58.638 --> 10:09.710
11, 12 years old and had always lived by that. That 
coupled with everything I knew about our founding

10:10.270 --> 10:25.827
fathers and the way that United States of America 
was founded, history, government, politics,

10:10.270 --> 10:25.827
political science, All of that made eminent sense 
to me when you look at truth, the truth, whole

10:26.448 --> 10:39.625
truth, and nothing but the truth, and then what 
Jesus said, he's the truth, the way, and the life.

10:41.507 --> 10:44.070
To me, truth trumps everything. Did those A&M 
semesters, did they reinforce all those ideas?

10:53.422 --> 10:54.143
Well, they helped. help develop them and 
reinforce them. I think a lot of the reinforcement

10:57.344 --> 10:59.688
came later. I think that was part of the 
developmental period and learning that and

10:59.768 --> 11:11.667
learning to appreciate that in a way that a lot of my 
adult contemporaries still don't seem to

10:59.768 --> 11:11.667
appreciate. As an engineering major, were there 
some key engineering and or math science courses

11:12.528 --> 11:20.080
that you recall? No just all of them helped 
reinforce the idea that there is order in the

11:22.068 --> 11:47.451
universe and I know as you get into really higher 
levels there is the chaos theory and some of that

11:22.068 --> 11:47.451
but that's way out on the fringes when you're 
pressing the edges of the envelope of knowledge

11:22.068 --> 11:47.451
and science and so forth but from the fundamental 
standpoint There is order in the universe and I

11:47.971 --> 12:07.414
think the same creator that

11:47.971 --> 12:07.414
created spiritual laws and religious laws and 
interpersonal relationship guidelines also

11:47.971 --> 12:07.414
created the laws of nature that affect science, 
mathematics, medicine, chemistry, all of those

12:07.580 --> 12:14.307
things. And without order and predictability,

12:14.367 --> 12:21.174
society could never progress. And I think it was 
the Renaissance and the Reformation that brought

12:21.454 --> 12:33.587
us out of the Dark Ages, where in the terms of human 
evolution, where people began to realize

12:35.845 --> 13:02.967
although it took many more generations to really 
bring it to fruition that just because a dictator

12:35.845 --> 13:02.967
or an authoritarian or an elite group or an 
aristocratic family or something had power and

12:35.845 --> 13:02.967
could dictate what

12:35.845 --> 13:02.967
the rules and what the mores and things were going 
to be didn't necessarily mean they were right. and

13:03.031 --> 13:25.461
that scientists and academicians could

13:03.031 --> 13:25.461
find truth and folks like Michelangelo and Dante 
even though they might be unpopular or outcast or a

13:03.031 --> 13:25.461
prize in their own time they knew truth and knew how 
to to express it and fortunately in many cases we

13:26.167 --> 13:45.271
have the record of what they thought even when it 
was a minority opinion at the time or unpopular or

13:26.167 --> 13:45.271
might even get them persecuted like Martin 
Luther's theses. You know history proved that

13:46.032 --> 13:53.001
they were right and truth prevailed even though 
the ruling authorities at the time

13:55.225 --> 13:59.769
not only didn't go along with it, didn't like it, in 
some cases persecuted and martyred the people for

13:55.225 --> 13:59.769
it. For you and your buddies, what did you all think 
were the unwritten rules about class attendance

14:02.012 --> 14:12.462
and class behavior and so forth?

14:13.403 --> 14:22.532
Most of that was set by each individual instructor 
and some of them made it very clear that you would be

14:13.403 --> 14:22.532
there for every class and for every class you 
missed if it was unexcused or if you didn't come by

14:22.613 --> 14:35.812
and make amends or apologize or offer the reason 
for it, a valid reason, that that was half a letter

14:22.613 --> 14:35.812
grade. Did you do it regularly? Yes, I did. Not only 
because it was demanded. I expected it of myself. I

14:44.946 --> 14:46.528
just don't think you can keep up in a fast-moving 
environment. And like I said, I'm not a whiz kid

14:49.623 --> 15:03.778
that can cut five or six classes and then cram for an 
exam the night before or maybe listen to a few notes

14:49.623 --> 15:03.778
or maybe scan a CliffsNotes the night before a test 
and still ace it. I can't do that. I have to... What

15:05.460 --> 15:11.187
about, were there ever any pranks in class? Did 
y'all, y'all didn't... Not any that stand out.

15:16.284 --> 15:18.026
There may have been some occasionally. I would 
like to go back to that one. This was significant to

15:21.070 --> 15:26.356
me, that class on logic and effective discourse. 
When I went in to take the final exam, it was a two or

15:27.737 --> 15:34.625
three part exam. And in fact, I think

15:42.685 --> 15:46.771
One of the parts was even before the final exam day. 
So when we came in there was a one part had already

15:47.873 --> 15:54.723
been turned in. There was another part that was 
done the first hour and another part that was done

15:54.784 --> 16:06.982
the second hour and then the third hour was where 
you could finish up anything you wanted and turn it

15:54.784 --> 16:06.982
in. Well at the end of the first hour I turned my 
paper in, and it was more of a true-false type, a

16:10.647 --> 16:17.294
quick one. And then the next one was a series of 
essays. And so I turned it in, and the prof, about 20

16:21.017 --> 16:39.456
minutes into the next session, he said, Mr. Ray, he 
said, you've done well enough that if you leave

16:21.017 --> 16:39.456
right now, you'll get a B in the class. And I said,

16:41.157 --> 16:47.948
how strong will it be? Is it close enough that if I do 
well on this last one, I can get an A? And he thought

16:52.536 --> 16:53.698
for a minute. He wasn't expecting that. He thought 
for a minute, and he said, it's possible. So I

17:00.277 --> 17:05.783
stayed that third and finished those essays and 
turned them in and I did get an A in the class. And I

17:06.343 --> 17:26.183
don't know if my work was really that good or not but 
just the fact that I had turned down that

17:06.343 --> 17:26.183
opportunity to quit and take what I had to try to 
work for an A signaled to him that I was interested

17:06.343 --> 17:26.183
in it and I guess I did well enough on that that he 
gave me an A in it anyway. So you and your buddies

17:26.804 --> 17:28.667
went to class regularly. How many hours did you 
normally take per semester?

17:33.955 --> 17:34.536
17 or 18. In fact, I think 18 was more the norm, and 
occasionally 19 or 20. And I think the lightest

17:38.843 --> 17:48.158
load I ever had, excluding my last semester, in 
which case I took 15 or 16. But I think prior to that,

17:48.458 --> 17:54.448
of the first eight semesters, I think I had one that 
had 17. And all the others were 18 or more. You know

17:57.428 --> 18:05.113
that 12 is now considered by most students to be 
a... And when I see that and I thought, oh my

17:57.428 --> 18:05.113
goodness, this... This trend toward social 
promotion and feel good promotions and

18:05.583 --> 18:17.420
artificial self-esteem is really getting out of 
hand. I really worry about the future of our

18:17.941 --> 18:27.895
civilization if this trend continues because if 
you don't have high standards and maintain them

18:17.941 --> 18:27.895
and work toward them, you're not prepared to face 
life. And I think it's a huge mistake among the

18:31.188 --> 18:49.394
educational communities and the teachers' 
unions and the educational curriculum directors

18:31.188 --> 18:49.394
and all of these folks that have been preaching 
situational ethics and moral relativism and all

18:31.188 --> 18:49.394
of that other stuff. They're really undermining 
the foundations of our civilization. I really

18:53.020 --> 18:58.067
feel strongly about that, but I'm not really sure 
what I can do about it other than mention it as often

18:58.165 --> 19:05.132
as I can, and as a matter of fact, those kind of 
distinctions is what caused our marriage to break

18:58.165 --> 19:05.132
up. You never thought about dropping out of A&M, 
transferring. When that first year was over, how

19:12.500 --> 19:19.988
did you feel it had gone?

19:20.008 --> 19:22.491
I felt like it had gone very well. I mean, there had 
been some ups and downs. There had been some little

19:25.553 --> 19:53.738
incidents in the dorm where I'd gotten crossways 
with some of my classmates over some of their

19:25.553 --> 19:53.738
activities and one

19:25.553 --> 19:53.738
of the times that one of the issues was porno flicks 
in the dormitory and I

19:25.553 --> 19:53.738
guess in a way I was a little bit naive and maybe a 
little bit prudish but at the same time there were

19:25.553 --> 19:53.738
some practical aspects of that is that Once you let 
your mind wander over into those areas, it's very

19:54.308 --> 20:05.741
distracting to accomplishing serious goals and 
purposes in life. That next year, was it better to

20:08.083 --> 20:10.306
be a sophomore? Oh, absolutely. So much, so much 
better. Because now you could be in charge and

20:15.291 --> 20:23.320
there was much less harassment, although the 
responsibility was still... Even if you had

20:23.637 --> 20:42.682
determined from the way you were treated as a fish 
that you were going to be more enlightened in your

20:23.637 --> 20:42.682
leadership,

20:23.637 --> 20:42.682
you still had to be really diligent because you 
didn't want the outfit to fall down. Sometimes you

20:43.102 --> 20:48.970
had to be pretty tough on guys that were either slow 
learners or indifferent to really a search for

20:49.085 --> 21:00.817
excellence and success and being the best you 
could be as an outfit and as an individual. So

21:01.418 --> 21:08.705
sometimes you have to, some people only 
understand a harassing type motivation. Most

21:09.726 --> 21:17.995
people, however, respond to leadership by 
example and will take instruction and correction

21:09.726 --> 21:17.995
the way it's intended. What do you think that Fish, 
your sophomore year, thought about you as a

21:19.004 --> 21:26.888
sophomore?

21:28.218 --> 21:50.697
I don't know, I never got water ballooned or babo 
bombed, and

21:28.218 --> 21:50.697
I've always had good relationships with the guys, 
not really close friendships or anything, but

21:28.218 --> 21:50.697
sometimes guys will write to me, especially when I 
came back from Vietnam, calls and letters. You had

21:50.717 --> 21:51.758
a different roommate. Right.

21:59.774 --> 22:05.801
those undergraduate years, to whom did you turn 
for advice, if you needed particularly academic

21:59.774 --> 22:05.801
advice? Well,

22:06.542 --> 22:14.772
first thing I was going to say, the advice in 
general. I was still active in the First Baptist

22:14.912 --> 22:21.520
Church and College Station and the Baptist 
Student Union. Cliff Harris was the director of

22:22.922 --> 22:28.228
the Baptist Student Union in those days.

22:29.272 --> 22:56.376
the folks at Sunday school class teachers, I 
always felt like any time, especially any moral

22:29.272 --> 22:56.376
issues, like I went over and talked to a Sunday 
school teacher who referred me to the pastor who at

22:29.272 --> 22:56.376
that time was

22:29.272 --> 22:56.376
Cecil Sherman.

22:58.651 --> 23:09.401
And I guess this was my sophomore year, concerning 
the porno flicks and some things that were going on

22:58.651 --> 23:09.401
in the dorm that I didn't like. And I went over and 
talked to him about how you stand up for what's

23:09.741 --> 23:26.397
right, but at the same time not break your 
relationships with your outfit and your

23:09.741 --> 23:26.397
classmates and your squadron mates and so forth. 
And so that was a very helpful outlet.

23:34.036 --> 23:42.464
Academically,

23:34.036 --> 23:42.464
Dean Ransdell was one of our squadron advisors. 
And in engineering, there was a guy who had either

23:43.965 --> 23:54.115
an injured or withered arm. Crawford? I think 
Crawford later on became was a dean but at that time

23:56.245 --> 24:19.806
he was a I guess a professor and was an academic 
advisor so you know when if you if you felt like you

23:56.245 --> 24:19.806
were in trouble and weren't sure whether you're 
going to make it through without getting an F or D in

23:56.245 --> 24:19.806
the class sometimes you could go and and sometimes 
he could contact the prof and say well you know is

24:20.360 --> 24:32.177
this guy just not trying or is he is it a little too 
difficult or and sometimes they can maybe could

24:20.360 --> 24:32.177
recommend maybe some extra sessions. I never got 
something for nothing and I'm glad I didn't

24:32.497 --> 24:42.271
because I think that that sets up real bad habits 
for the future. Were there supposedly some easy

24:42.772 --> 24:47.278
courses then where everybody made a high grade? 
Oh, the physical education. Some folks claim that

24:50.278 --> 24:55.666
the military science courses were cush courses, 
as they called them. And there were some that had a

24:56.707 --> 25:05.701
reputation that if you felt like you wanted one or 
needed one to get your GPA up, you could take it. And

25:05.741 --> 25:11.850
I had heard about those, but I don't think I was ever 
tempted to sign up for one like that. What about at

25:12.030 --> 25:13.493
the other extreme? Were there some courses that 
everybody thought it was real tough? Yeah, there

25:18.308 --> 25:20.191
was chemistry. There were several chemistry 
classes. There were some calculus classes. But

25:29.185 --> 25:41.985
here again, I figured that if they're tough, that 
means that it's important to know the stuff, and

25:29.185 --> 25:41.985
you've got to know it. If you're not willing to put 
that effort into it, if you don't really like it,

25:46.135 --> 25:49.879
then you better find another profession. And

25:50.860 --> 26:05.076
then there were some instructors that were

25:50.860 --> 26:05.076
sometimes a little bit difficult to deal with. And 
one that I didn't get along with very well at all was

26:05.156 --> 26:08.580
Ivy League Taylor. A lot of folks liked him because 
he didn't really demand much day to day. But he was

26:16.443 --> 26:18.848
very demanding on the tests. And it was subtle, and 
it was difficult. It was almost like you were being

26:24.420 --> 26:30.352
tricked into being

26:24.420 --> 26:30.352
lazy. Because he'd just come in. He'd sit on the 
desk and tell stories. And the reading

26:34.752 --> 26:39.939
assignments were all kind of general and not very 
specific. The learning objectives were not very

26:40.761 --> 26:43.364
specific. And I like things to be structured. I 
like to know in advance. And it's not that I want

26:48.812 --> 27:01.771
somebody to teach the test to me, but I want 
somebody to structure some learning objectives

26:48.812 --> 27:01.771
so that I'll know as I go along whether I'm meeting 
these. When something is just so... nebulous that

27:03.878 --> 27:28.857
there's no form or no apparent function to it other 
than just remembering details of who did what to

27:03.878 --> 27:28.857
whom at a certain part in history if it doesn't have 
some significance to contributing to an idea or a

27:03.878 --> 27:28.857
principle or a growth or an evolution of a system of 
government or a system of philosophy and if I think

27:30.271 --> 27:52.212
that something is going in that direction and the 
prof is not interested he's just interested in

27:30.271 --> 27:52.212
anecdotal details and a lot of details sometimes 
frivolous detail then I don't it's hard for me to

27:30.271 --> 27:52.212
relate to that and as a result of the I think maybe I 
had two D's and one F in my whole career at A&M. All

27:57.597 --> 28:05.509
the rest were mostly B's, occasional C's, and 
probably had more A's than I had C's. But the two D's

28:05.590 --> 28:10.818
and the F were all in history classes. Because 
history was, if it were not structured, it was just

28:12.500 --> 28:21.574
difficult for me to relate to it. And then when I 
tried to put a structure to it, sometimes I was

28:21.875 --> 28:39.732
incorrect, or sometimes I had misinterpreted 
something, or maybe I was reaching a conclusion

28:21.875 --> 28:39.732
that maybe wasn't evident from that particular 
example in history. So for some reason, I just

28:40.452 --> 28:50.802
didn't do well in the history courses, although I 
took enough of them that by the time toward the end

28:40.452 --> 28:50.802
of my sophomore year, realized I didn't want to do 
engineering for the rest of my life and at that

28:51.406 --> 29:12.857
point I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do but I 
was being pulled maybe toward a pre-law degree

28:51.406 --> 29:12.857
maybe going to law school or maybe going into 
full-time Christian ministry so I knew English

29:13.951 --> 29:43.502
and liberal arts would be a good background for 
either of those in fact the pre-law curriculum and

29:13.951 --> 29:43.502
the English curriculum when I went back and 
compared the text I was trying to decide what my new

29:13.951 --> 29:43.502
major would be they were pretty similar but I chose 
English as my new major because it offered the most

29:13.951 --> 29:43.502
undesignated electives so I had a lot of places to 
park a lot of my science and math and engineering

29:13.951 --> 29:43.502
courses that otherwise

29:43.972 --> 29:50.519
I would lose if I had picked any other major. And 
even at that, I had to go one extra semester because

29:50.920 --> 29:56.025
I had a lot of courses that just wouldn't transfer. 
I had enough hours, but they weren't the right

29:56.045 --> 29:58.928
ones. Major in English and a minor in history. So I 
ended up with a minor in history in spite of the fact

30:01.651 --> 30:08.599
that some of my history courses didn't count for 
credit. Were there some special teachers you had

30:10.881 --> 30:13.624
in that major? that you now look back on and realize 
they were important?

30:29.753 --> 30:32.696
I believe you're the only one that I can remember 
specifically. I remember Ivy League Taylor, but I

30:33.517 --> 30:38.463
got a negative feeling about that. And then there 
was one other history

30:45.177 --> 30:48.821
Well, I can't remember the names, so 
apparently... What about over in English? In

30:50.103 --> 30:55.590
English,

30:50.103 --> 30:55.590
Harrison Hurth, John Paul Abbott.

31:00.456 --> 31:03.399
Those are the only two names that just off the top of 
my head... I do remember one particular incident

31:05.522 --> 31:14.593
in...

31:15.822 --> 31:16.183
Yeah.
