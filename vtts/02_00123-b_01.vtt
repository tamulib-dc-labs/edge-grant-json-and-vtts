WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:15.898
people that were, you know, 13, 14 years younger than I was that just graduated out of the Houston and Dallas and the big, big high schools.

00:15.918 --> 00:23.448
The trigonometry and math and chemistry was all just a breeze for them.

00:23.468 --> 00:31.438
It was just kind of a review for them and I had to really work at it and not only working at learning the subjects,

00:31.823 --> 00:34.066
I had to learn how to study again.

00:35.147 --> 00:47.804
And it was hard to discipline myself back to getting in a routine of studying.

00:48.165 --> 00:52.050
Did they think of you as an old guy since you were 10 years older than they were?

00:52.090 --> 00:55.555
No, there was still enough of us around.

00:55.915 --> 00:56.957
Okay.

00:57.017 --> 01:01.763
Particularly out at the Annex to

01:02.789 --> 01:16.407
I guess it was more, I was thought of more as, as an old, older person, old guy, after I got on the main campus, where there were more, more younger students.

01:16.447 --> 01:31.547
There was still a fair amount of veterans out there, and enough of them to, and I think that the whole society was, was appreciative of what

01:31.898 --> 01:35.383
what people in the service had done during World War II.

01:35.403 --> 01:42.192
Was there anybody during that year that you turned to for advice that you remember, a conversation that was important to you?

01:44.174 --> 01:45.396
I don't recall, no.

01:47.419 --> 01:52.325
And did you all come to the campus for football games or?

01:52.505 --> 01:55.189
Yes, yeah, and that's about the only thing we came for.

01:56.080 --> 01:56.781
You had a car.

01:57.222 --> 01:57.462
Yeah.

01:57.742 --> 01:58.183
One car.

01:59.585 --> 02:01.327
I bought a brand new Buick.

02:01.988 --> 02:06.634
Not Buick, Packard.

02:06.694 --> 02:10.920
Packard straight eight with a Columbia overdrive in it.

02:10.940 --> 02:13.904
What did you pay?

02:13.964 --> 02:15.306
About $1,800 I think it was.

02:15.987 --> 02:17.208
Don't you wish you had it now?

02:17.529 --> 02:18.911
I sure do.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.653
And we bought that

02:22.895 --> 02:24.517
in the late spring of 49.

02:24.537 --> 02:28.642
It was a 49 model.

02:28.662 --> 02:29.704
Did you, when you came?

02:29.744 --> 02:30.725
Well we had two cars.

02:30.825 --> 02:31.726
No I had a Jeep.

02:32.107 --> 02:33.909
Oh really?

02:33.929 --> 02:35.652
When you came up here did you bring them both?

02:35.852 --> 02:37.534
Yeah.

02:37.554 --> 02:48.328
And I guess the first semester I sold that Jeep to somebody who just graduated from A&M that was going to Alaska.

02:50.485 --> 02:53.231
Of course, I walked all the classes out there at 10X.

02:54.914 --> 02:58.441
And you wore your old uniforms, you said, to class?

02:58.501 --> 02:58.742
Yeah.

02:59.283 --> 03:04.393
I was getting $120 a month from the government.

03:04.998 --> 03:11.672
She spells her name F-L-O-R-I-S?

03:12.333 --> 03:13.776
F-L-O-R-A-C-E.

03:14.438 --> 03:16.803
A-C-E, okay.

03:17.604 --> 03:23.597
How did you and the other guys and the other students out there, how did y'all behave in class?

03:24.708 --> 03:26.050
Was there any mischief?

03:26.070 --> 03:26.891
I don't recall.

03:27.812 --> 03:32.618
I recall everybody being pretty serious about what they were doing.

03:32.999 --> 03:34.080
And you went regularly?

03:34.440 --> 03:34.721
Yes.

03:35.021 --> 03:37.144
And you didn't go to sleep in class?

03:37.164 --> 03:37.985
No.

03:38.005 --> 03:41.469
Was there any kind of pranks or tricks?

03:41.489 --> 03:46.075
I don't recall any.

03:46.095 --> 03:50.821
Now, who took charge of those 18-year-old freshmen?

03:50.881 --> 03:52.183
Who was out there to...

03:53.750 --> 03:57.455
I don't know, and I really wasn't too concerned about that.

03:57.955 --> 04:03.482
Now, I know they organized a fishman band and the fish drill team.

04:03.543 --> 04:06.667
Did you all see that, those two groups practicing?

04:07.247 --> 04:14.016
I remember the band, and I like to hear the band.

04:14.036 --> 04:15.638
Yes, I can remember that.

04:15.918 --> 04:18.762
And I can remember them drilling out there and whatnot.

04:19.163 --> 04:28.494
You know, I spent five years watching people drill and conducting a lot of it myself, so that wasn't really anything worth going to see.

04:30.737 --> 04:34.802
What was it like when you went to the football games that fall here?

04:35.322 --> 04:37.104
How did you feel and what did you all do?

04:38.506 --> 04:45.154
Well, I guess pretty much like the youngsters do now, still everybody stood up and everybody participated in all of the

04:45.742 --> 04:47.945
All the yells.

04:47.965 --> 04:49.246
And you kissed your date after?

04:52.310 --> 04:52.591
Yeah, yeah.

04:53.051 --> 05:04.345
And then that first fall, if you and your wife were going to kind of have a little bit of a good time on a Saturday night, what did you and the other married folks do?

05:05.086 --> 05:08.290
Oh, some time we'd get together and play bridge.

05:09.232 --> 05:11.795
Once in a while we'd go to the picture show.

05:11.996 --> 05:12.817
Where?

05:12.837 --> 05:13.898
In Bryan.

05:13.918 --> 05:15.720
In Bryan, we'd go to the picture show.

05:19.445 --> 05:22.509
Where'd you buy groceries?

05:22.529 --> 05:29.438
At A&P, usually before she'd come into Bryan and buy groceries.

05:29.458 --> 05:39.070
But usually she did that after, on a work day after she got through the work on her way home.

05:41.429 --> 05:45.073
And did y'all go visit family out of town much?

05:45.173 --> 05:47.455
Well, not too much, but we did.

05:48.016 --> 05:56.544
Her folks lived in Dallas, and mine lived, of course, down in Sweeney.

05:58.666 --> 06:07.555
And I had a brother then that was, let me see, Chuck was living in El Campo, I guess, at that time.

06:09.830 --> 06:11.672
Yeah, we visited family.

06:13.794 --> 06:19.341
And you and your veterans' buddies didn't, y'all weren't hazed in any way?

06:19.361 --> 06:21.784
No.

06:21.804 --> 06:25.127
Nobody told you how to dress or walk or anything?

06:25.448 --> 06:25.568
No.

06:26.449 --> 06:29.572
Then, when did y'all move to College View?

06:29.953 --> 06:31.354
At the end of the spring semester?

06:32.275 --> 06:33.497
Yes, during the summer.

06:33.757 --> 06:39.043
We moved over here, and of course I went to summer school,

06:39.378 --> 06:41.701
here on campus.

06:41.721 --> 06:44.285
I don't believe they had a summer school out at the annex.

06:44.305 --> 06:45.206
I don't think so.

06:45.266 --> 06:46.007
I don't remember.

06:46.828 --> 06:48.971
Do you remember what the rent was at Collinsview?

06:49.932 --> 06:50.753
Twenty dollars.

06:52.075 --> 06:53.717
Describe that apartment, please.

06:55.440 --> 07:08.237
Well, in size, I guess it was probably 24 foot square.

07:09.466 --> 07:10.247
One bedroom?

07:10.868 --> 07:11.669
Two bedrooms.

07:12.911 --> 07:18.299
Half of it had two bedrooms.

07:18.460 --> 07:22.846
In between those bedrooms was a walk-in closet.

07:22.866 --> 07:37.448
Across the back was a shower and a bathroom, and then there was an area that was probably six by eight that was the kitchen.

07:38.626 --> 07:43.696
And it did furnish a stove, but no refrigerator.

07:43.716 --> 07:44.477
So you had to buy?

07:44.638 --> 07:47.964
We bought a used refrigerator for $50.

07:49.507 --> 07:50.649
But that was a lot of money then.

07:50.669 --> 07:54.396
Yeah, and used it all the time that we were in.

07:55.759 --> 07:58.203
And College View, I presume, was filled up?

07:59.506 --> 08:01.630
Yes, yes, there was.

08:03.213 --> 08:05.817
eight apartments in each building.

08:07.379 --> 08:08.861
Were you all on the first or second floor?

08:09.102 --> 08:10.203
We was on the ground floor.

08:10.404 --> 08:12.266
Was that better than being upstairs?

08:12.627 --> 08:14.229
Well, yes.

08:15.291 --> 08:18.956
Our oldest son was born in College View.

08:19.838 --> 08:22.462
And, of course, he wasn't born there.

08:22.482 --> 08:23.002
He was born in St.

08:23.042 --> 08:23.924
Joseph.

08:23.944 --> 08:24.685
We were living there.

08:25.186 --> 08:26.488
Who was the doctor?

08:27.729 --> 08:28.130
Smith.

08:29.492 --> 08:30.874
Roy Smith.

08:31.799 --> 08:38.887
a Navy doctor, and a World War I and II better.

08:39.228 --> 08:39.608
Oh, boy.

08:40.529 --> 08:43.493
And I presume you all made some good friends in College View.

08:43.793 --> 08:45.315
Yes, yes, we did.

08:47.177 --> 08:58.410
One of the ladies is still, we still visit with her from time to time and correspond with her.

08:58.430 --> 08:59.832
She now lives in Tucson.

09:00.925 --> 09:02.855
Her husband is dead.

09:04.906 --> 09:08.927
But she's the only one of the people that

09:10.038 --> 09:15.444
that lived in that apartment, although we knew and kept up with all of them for a while.

09:15.665 --> 09:17.727
It wasn't one thing about that.

09:17.747 --> 09:17.987
All right.

09:19.629 --> 09:25.456
Describe a class day routine for you and your wife living in College View.

09:26.317 --> 09:27.799
I presume you walked class.

09:27.859 --> 09:29.040
I presume you didn't drive.

09:30.662 --> 09:35.408
No, I rode over with Floris when she went to work.

09:35.548 --> 09:37.530
Oh, okay.

09:38.742 --> 09:51.057
In the fall, after summer school, before I enrolled in the fall semester, I went by to see Joe Orr.

09:51.498 --> 09:52.238
You know Joe?

09:54.241 --> 10:03.332
Joe was in charge of surveying in the civil engineering department, and had a business, and he did

10:04.190 --> 10:09.286
Most of the survey that was done in this area, Joel did.

10:10.510 --> 10:15.084
Well, I already had my license, so I went to work for Joel.

10:15.104 --> 10:17.271
Do you remember what the pay was?

10:23.258 --> 10:29.188
something like a dollar an hour, two dollars an hour, maybe a dollar and a half, I don't know, something.

10:29.328 --> 10:30.029
Less than two.

10:30.650 --> 10:36.019
But anyway, it wasn't long before I was pretty well running my store's business.

10:38.102 --> 10:40.746
So you're doing that while being a full-time student?

10:40.767 --> 10:41.027
Yeah.

10:41.588 --> 10:48.439
So what I did, I went over there with Floris, and I tried to schedule

10:49.465 --> 10:56.873
my classes all in blocks to where I went just from one class to another with a minimum amount of time in between.

10:57.353 --> 10:58.495
Couldn't always do that.

11:00.797 --> 11:13.991
But what I'd do is, Mr. Orr had an office there in the old Negro building there, and I'd go in his office and work on a survey, or maybe do a little studying, but more apt to work on.

11:14.391 --> 11:16.013
He had a drafting table and I'd

11:16.347 --> 11:19.253
old rotary calculator in there.

11:22.379 --> 11:25.465
Now was civil engineering pretty well all in Nagel Hall?

11:25.625 --> 11:27.449
Yeah.

11:27.730 --> 11:32.118
And where did you, what part of the campus did you have most of your classes?

11:32.178 --> 11:34.583
Where, where did you?

11:34.703 --> 11:36.988
There in the academic building.

11:39.432 --> 11:51.031
The chemistry building, you know, we had chemistry classes over there, but the math was nearly, and the English, as I recall, was all in the academic building at that time.

11:51.292 --> 11:55.979
Who did you turn to for academic advice on what courses to take and so forth?

11:57.001 --> 11:58.183
Who was your advisor?

12:09.132 --> 12:11.254
No, it wasn't.

12:11.414 --> 12:18.141
Who was that?

12:18.161 --> 12:20.042
Randall.

12:23.506 --> 12:24.266
Dean Ranstle?

12:24.607 --> 12:25.347
Ranstle, yeah.

12:25.367 --> 12:25.768
Oh, really?

12:25.828 --> 12:26.028
Yeah.

12:26.368 --> 12:27.750
Oh, see, I knew him.

12:27.870 --> 12:29.111
Yeah.

12:29.131 --> 12:30.132
Was he a good advisor?

12:30.252 --> 12:31.513
Yeah, I thought he was.

12:32.114 --> 12:33.835
I'd be surprised if you hadn't said that.

12:35.017 --> 12:38.700
I liked him.

12:41.718 --> 12:45.925
I don't say I didn't need any guidance, because I always needed all the guidance I could get.

12:46.546 --> 12:51.816
But what I was going to take never was a problem for me.

12:51.836 --> 13:00.751
The only way it would become a problem was if I had to take something that was, you know, prerequisite for something else, I had to get it all in the right order.

13:01.372 --> 13:05.920
And once in a while they'd let me take something out of order, if it fit in.

13:08.296 --> 13:12.523
Do you remember some of the nicknames you all gave to the faculty?

13:14.246 --> 13:16.751
Well, it was Coach Snuffy Smith.

13:18.053 --> 13:19.215
Why was he called Snuffy?

13:20.637 --> 13:24.083
From I guess a cartoon character.

13:26.628 --> 13:27.449
Did you know him?

13:30.334 --> 13:32.498
I had him.

13:34.132 --> 13:35.935
Fred Benson.

13:35.955 --> 13:38.340
Oh, describe Fred Benson.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.863
Make believe I never met him.

13:42.047 --> 13:47.857
Fred Benson was the best teacher that I ever had at A&E.

13:47.877 --> 13:52.326
He was, I guess, probably an instructor at that point in time.

13:52.346 --> 13:54.490
I had some good teachers.

13:54.510 --> 13:56.393
Dr. Nederman, did you know him?

13:56.643 --> 13:59.106
Oh, Wendell Netterman.

13:59.226 --> 14:00.267
Yes, yes, yes.

14:00.548 --> 14:01.048
I had him.

14:01.969 --> 14:06.815
He later would be president at what is now the University of Texas at Arlington.

14:07.095 --> 14:07.416
Yes.

14:13.683 --> 14:14.404
Spencer Buchanan.

14:15.025 --> 14:16.446
You know him?

14:16.466 --> 14:22.954
Of course I went to work for him.

14:23.474 --> 14:29.520
Describe Benson, though, and describe his personality and the way he taught.

14:29.540 --> 14:35.625
He gave you a course outline.

14:36.887 --> 14:40.050
He wrote every note on the board.

14:44.534 --> 14:49.859
And he didn't, when I say write, that's a misstatement.

14:49.899 --> 14:51.220
He printed everything.

14:52.634 --> 15:04.447
And he would get up to the blackboard and he would be, he would be riding with this hand and racing with this hand.

15:05.067 --> 15:07.170
And he'd ride over here in the race.

15:07.650 --> 15:12.836
And everything that he, whatever he expected you to know, he put up there on that board.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.377
Was he always well organized?

15:14.618 --> 15:14.938
Yes.

15:15.759 --> 15:16.880
Of course I could tell he was.

15:18.201 --> 15:22.506
He knew, he knew what he was, and he presented things

15:23.127 --> 15:38.884
in an organized, logical manner, step one, two, three, that, like I say, he was a Snuffin Smith.

15:43.589 --> 15:51.177
I don't know where they're all, I'll put this down for record, but that's,

15:52.760 --> 16:03.116
I had him for, I guess it was 305, first structures course.

16:05.179 --> 16:06.922
And I had Benson for the lab.

16:09.706 --> 16:14.273
And that's just like walking from daylight to dark.

16:14.293 --> 16:19.020
I mean walking out of a dark room into bright light.

16:23.202 --> 16:24.644
And Dr. Nederman was good.

16:29.329 --> 16:30.010
Bob Shiller.

16:31.131 --> 16:32.873
You know Bob?

16:33.093 --> 16:36.237
Bob Bush, you know what, he knows hydraulics.

16:37.098 --> 16:40.542
I knew his dad, I don't know if he ever knew.

16:40.562 --> 16:47.070
His dad retired from the highway department and was working for Buchanan when I went to work for him.

16:47.090 --> 16:50.914
See, this is an editorial note to the typist.

16:51.518 --> 17:08.557
Dr. Wendell Nederman, N-E-D-D-E-R-M-A-N, was president at the University of Texas at Arlington, and one day he told me that he went into then the Dean of Engineering Fred Benson's office to seek his advice.

17:09.598 --> 17:16.446
He'd been offered the job to go up to what was then Arlington State College, a two-year school,

17:17.101 --> 17:29.038
and they were going to make it into a senior college and he was offered the job to organize the junior and senior years for engineering and to head the engineering program up there.

17:30.561 --> 17:34.907
He told me that he went into Dean Fred Benson's office and asked him what he

17:35.478 --> 17:36.219
thought he should do.

17:37.180 --> 17:45.350
And he said Benson told him that if he stayed here at A&M, he had a fine future, he was a splendid teacher, a good researcher, that he would do well.

17:46.391 --> 17:56.524
But he said Benson then looked out the window and said, but if you go up there, goodness knows what might happen, because who knows how big

17:56.504 --> 18:07.039
Arlington may be as a city, and how big the Dallas-Fort Worth area might become, and who knows what kind of a school you might create.

18:08.040 --> 18:20.858
Well, he moved from dean of engineering to be the vice president for academics, and then he was the president that led the University of Texas at Arlington to become a real, good, solid

18:20.838 --> 18:25.184
a very broad curriculum, end of note.

18:28.469 --> 18:34.678
As you, were you still, by your sophomore year, were you still wearing old World War II uniforms to class reckon?

18:34.999 --> 18:36.861
Yeah, yeah.

18:37.362 --> 18:39.505
And did you get a nickname?

18:39.485 --> 18:40.486
No.

18:40.687 --> 18:41.548
You didn't get any?

18:41.568 --> 18:41.668
No.

18:42.469 --> 18:49.419
And did members of the Corps ever bother you veterans walking down the hallway or anything?

18:49.459 --> 18:49.800
Not at all.

18:50.321 --> 18:50.861
Not at all.

18:51.242 --> 18:52.323
They respected you?

18:52.343 --> 18:52.584
Yes.

18:53.405 --> 19:05.222
Of course my day as I started out I'd go to class, I'd go over at eight o'clock and if I had eight o'clock class I went to eight o'clock and if I didn't have one at nine o'clock I went to Mr. Orr's.

19:05.202 --> 19:10.589
office and worked over 10, and if I had 10 o'clock class then I went there and I came back.

19:10.629 --> 19:16.676
So I didn't spend a lot of time wandering around over the campus.

19:17.457 --> 19:33.758
And then in the afternoons I tried to block as many afternoons free as I could, and I'd take a survey crew and go out and do whatever work needed to be done in the afternoons and then on the weekends, and I'd also came

19:34.042 --> 19:38.593
come up there and work at night in Mr. Orr's office.

19:38.613 --> 19:43.564
I had the key to his office, and that's really the way I met Spencer Buchanan.

19:44.947 --> 19:48.937
Spencer Buchanan worked up there all the time.

19:48.957 --> 19:52.084
He was always up there, either in class or.

19:52.773 --> 19:57.440
And of course he had a consulting business at that time.

19:58.342 --> 20:00.505
And you never thought about changing your major.

20:01.487 --> 20:03.510
Civil was what you always wanted to do.

20:03.530 --> 20:04.011
That's right.

20:04.031 --> 20:06.535
Were there any easy courses you remember?

20:07.056 --> 20:08.238
Were there any, for anybody?

20:10.421 --> 20:14.247
Well, I'll tell you an instance.

20:14.347 --> 20:19.776
I don't know if you call it easy or not.

20:22.237 --> 20:24.860
surveying course, I made an A in.

20:25.281 --> 20:49.932
The second one, when I got my grade back, I had a B. And I was working with Mr. Orr all the time, and I had made 90, 95 plus on all the tests, and I went in.

20:50.789 --> 21:04.751
Now what would happen at this point in time, we were laying out a subdivision which was North Garden Acres in Bryan.

21:06.914 --> 21:17.691
And when I'd have some time off, well I'd go out there and work on that subdivision and we'd have a survey lab where Mr. Orr would say, well Claim you take this

21:18.700 --> 21:26.418
so-and-so can go out there and take a sound line of this trade or do whatever needs to be done out there, and I do.

21:28.082 --> 21:36.642
I went in and talked to him, and that story says, well, I got to looking at my book, and he says, you missed so many laps.

21:40.722 --> 21:43.965
And I said, yes, sir, I did miss a few.

21:44.065 --> 21:50.551
I didn't know what to say.

21:50.571 --> 21:55.095
Were there, as far as you and your buddies knew, were there any giveaway courses for the athletes?

21:55.516 --> 21:57.838
Or did they go to the same classes everybody else went to?

22:00.300 --> 22:09.008
Went to, now Darrell Hooper, who was shot put, and he was civil engineer and had some classes that I had.

22:10.895 --> 22:17.864
The ones that I knew about, there was no favoritism shown in any way to any of them.

22:17.904 --> 22:20.328
That's what I thought, I think that was true then.

22:22.911 --> 22:23.232
Yeah.

22:23.852 --> 22:34.827
The strong point of A&M at that point in time was, particularly for engineering, was when a student came out of A&M, he was ready to go to work and productively.

22:35.785 --> 22:37.427
That's not true today.

22:38.007 --> 22:51.823
Did you and your friends, while you were being students, did you all think you were getting useful, real world, applied engineering training?

22:52.404 --> 22:54.066
Did you all think you were being well prepared?

22:57.449 --> 22:59.852
In my early

23:00.423 --> 23:02.024
engineering courses know.

23:02.825 --> 23:21.000
And this is one of the biggest problems that I had was the textbook problems many times were problems that had really little or no practical application.

23:23.202 --> 23:28.506
I am leaning towards practicality by nature.

23:29.427 --> 23:30.328
And having worked

23:31.675 --> 23:36.620
for as long as I did before I went to school, this was doubly hard for me.

23:37.681 --> 23:50.273
I'd have a problem getting past the fact that the problem as stated was not something that you'd ever run, it wasn't a practical situation.

23:50.293 --> 23:59.742
And I had to learn and really work hard at arriving at a numerical answer that I knew was not,

24:00.110 --> 24:11.655
a practical type thing and the problem, you know, they'd tell me for instance, you know, you can't lay a sewer line on less than a half of

24:12.580 --> 24:14.023
five-tenths percent grade.

24:14.423 --> 24:19.312
Well, I just spent years down there on the coast where there was two feet to the mile of fall.

24:19.513 --> 24:20.154
You couldn't.

24:20.174 --> 24:20.915
And you knew better.

24:22.779 --> 24:36.664
And I agreed that it was desirable to have that, but you wouldn't ever put in anything, or you'd have sewer lines 40 foot deep down there in the flat coast country.

24:36.948 --> 24:39.772
Now, during the, let's talk about the campus a little.

24:39.792 --> 24:42.476
During that time, the MSC was being built.

24:42.897 --> 24:44.419
That's right.

24:44.719 --> 24:49.406
What did you all think about it when you saw what it was going to become and what it did?

24:49.747 --> 24:52.891
What was, what did you students think about the MSC?

24:52.971 --> 25:03.867
Well, I thought it was a marvelous building and I was interested and went over there as much as I could

25:04.893 --> 25:10.283
to see the construction and what was going on and the methods of construction.

25:10.323 --> 25:12.687
The same for G. Rod White.

25:12.707 --> 25:15.332
It was built during that time over there.

25:15.352 --> 25:15.793
Oh, I forgot.

25:15.933 --> 25:16.534
Yeah, yeah.

25:17.336 --> 25:18.899
At about the same time?

25:18.979 --> 25:19.580
Yeah.

25:19.740 --> 25:22.145
A little bit earlier, maybe.

25:22.165 --> 25:23.948
And Joe Orr's son,

25:24.451 --> 25:27.055
was the superintendent on that job.

25:27.155 --> 25:27.575
Which one?

25:28.777 --> 25:29.498
G. Rowling.

25:29.518 --> 25:29.919
G. Rowling.

25:29.959 --> 25:34.766
Worked for Tellebson out in Houston, who was a contractor on that.

25:34.786 --> 25:52.551
So to see big buildings built, you know, with lots of open span and things, these were not rare engineering feasts, but they were for a country boy that grew up out there in

25:53.105 --> 25:57.351
Spent a lot of time out in the rice field running the condors.

25:57.471 --> 26:00.615
Then when the MSC was finished, did you enjoy it?

26:00.915 --> 26:02.617
Yes, yes.

26:02.697 --> 26:06.603
We thought it was a wonderful, wonderful building.

26:06.623 --> 26:12.470
Was there any discussion about it being an air-conditioned building from day one?

26:17.256 --> 26:18.178
I don't recall.

26:18.238 --> 26:20.040
Of course, we were all grateful to it.

26:20.425 --> 26:24.992
But nobody said it was a superfluous waste of money or anything like that.

26:27.275 --> 26:34.545
Well, I think anybody went through the Texas summer down here, everybody would find a cool place.

26:35.647 --> 26:49.707
Although at College View, I bought a window fan, paid $20 for a kit for a window fan, and that was one of the best

26:49.973 --> 26:57.627
investments are probably the best investment I ever made.

26:57.647 --> 27:01.855
And then there were some mornings you would dry off because of the humidity.

27:04.640 --> 27:06.183
More than once.

27:06.203 --> 27:12.454
Let's see, did you and your wife and that youngster, did y'all go to Guyon Hall sometimes to movies and

27:12.974 --> 27:13.695
Other things?

27:14.216 --> 27:15.337
Yeah, sometime.

27:15.357 --> 27:26.333
Of course even after we moved here, well all three of our boys were born while we lived, while I was in school, while we lived in college years.

27:26.353 --> 27:39.893
And we had a black nanny that came into town and lived down here by Milliken, and she had a

27:41.392 --> 27:47.399
or something that worked at A&M and she came up to him to be there at eight o'clock in the morning.

27:47.459 --> 27:48.620
She took care of the children?

27:48.720 --> 27:49.941
Yeah.

27:50.142 --> 27:51.603
Oh, do you remember what you all paid her?

27:53.365 --> 27:54.166
No, I don't know.

27:54.246 --> 27:56.509
Probably five dollars a week or something like that.

27:57.129 --> 27:58.891
Miss Emma was her.

27:58.911 --> 27:59.612
Miss Emma.

27:59.632 --> 28:01.274
Miss Emma.

28:01.294 --> 28:05.779
And she was a dear friend of ours.

28:06.248 --> 28:08.872
And the boys behaved for her.

28:11.756 --> 28:19.466
Did you and the other veterans over there, did you all have any social life together?

28:19.486 --> 28:20.728
Did you all have parties?

28:22.110 --> 28:34.146
Oh again we played bridge sometimes, but my time was spent, it was consumed with

28:34.463 --> 28:40.551
either work or going to school or studying.

28:40.571 --> 28:43.315
Describe the student body in general then.

28:44.116 --> 28:46.599
Where were they from geographically?

28:46.679 --> 28:48.021
What kinds of families?

28:48.482 --> 28:49.523
What kind of money?

28:50.024 --> 28:51.806
What kind of attitudes did they have?

28:51.826 --> 29:03.542
Well, they were, it was unusual for a student to have a car at that point in time.

29:05.986 --> 29:10.111
all the Aggies that went wherever they were going hitchhiking.

29:12.074 --> 29:33.400
And in places like, of course, at the East Gate out there, on Friday afternoons, there was always a line there, and it was an orderly arrangement, where the first one that got there was at the head of the line, and the second one was second, and everybody understood where their place was.

29:34.702 --> 29:35.723
And people,

29:36.175 --> 29:38.158
in the community, including us.

29:38.198 --> 29:44.526
When we were going to Houston, we would particularly go by these gates, see if somebody wanted to go.

29:44.967 --> 29:46.228
And same thing in Houston.

29:46.268 --> 29:51.916
There was two or three places in Houston where the Aggies would gather to come back up here.

29:52.857 --> 30:01.849
And if we were in that area, we'd go by and pick up whoever was there, as many as we could carry, and bring them back.

30:02.990 --> 30:04.933
As far as

30:06.162 --> 30:12.970
My relationship with the student body was really a minimum.

30:14.191 --> 30:16.834
But where did these boys come from geographically?

30:18.116 --> 30:20.619
I think all over.

30:20.639 --> 30:22.761
Big towns and the country?

30:22.781 --> 30:23.482
And the small ones.

30:23.502 --> 30:33.233
Of course there was, as you would expect, there was more of them coming out of Dallas and Houston than there was out of

30:34.377 --> 30:35.459
in Bay City.

30:35.679 --> 30:37.321
Were they rich or poor or?

30:41.727 --> 30:57.289
It would certainly be my impression that relative to what you see over on the campus nowadays, they were not near as well off financially.

31:00.393 --> 31:02.376
They were more about

31:05.697 --> 31:07.540
coming up here and getting an education.

31:10.766 --> 31:19.020
And did it matter what your last name was, what your heredity was, what your background was?

31:19.060 --> 31:29.578
Ninety-plus percent of the students came from Texas.

31:31.077 --> 31:40.418
There were little or no minorities as we know minorities nowadays are called minorities.

31:40.438 --> 31:42.623
But there were some Hispanics.
