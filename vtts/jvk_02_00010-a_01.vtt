00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:30.983
testing testing one two three four five six seven eight this is monday the 19th of february sitting in what i'd call the living room uh dr mrs spencer bayne's home in bryan about to have the pleasure and honor of recording at least some of his memories

00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:33.267
of his student days at Texas A&M.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:45.159
Spencer, to begin with, describe family background, what did parents do for a living, where'd you grow up, where'd you go to high school, life before A&M.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.542
All right, Haskell.

00:00:50.464 --> 00:00:58.371
Background, Peter Henry Rowe was an uncle of mine in the class of 1917.

00:00:58.752 --> 00:01:00.193
I never knew.

00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:01.416
my uncle.

00:01:02.597 --> 00:01:13.789
But he was a student of Giesecke and some of the old timers in the electrical engineering business.

00:01:15.071 --> 00:01:28.425
And I always knew from that association, as I say, I never knew him, but he was a favorite son of my grandfather and of my

00:01:28.945 --> 00:01:58.885
grandmother and and his brother Jack Rowe and his sister Grace Rowe who was my mother always spoke so highly of Peter that I decided I was going to Texas A&M very early in my life and so it was rather predestined that I would go to A&M and let's see more background my father was an architect

00:01:59.455 --> 00:02:04.962
and he worked in San Antonio, Texas, where I lived and grew up mostly.

00:02:06.103 --> 00:02:20.381
In 1933, I believe it was, we moved to Henderson, Texas, because the architectural business had gone into a very slack period.

00:02:21.282 --> 00:02:25.007
Mr. Will Noonan was my father's boss,

00:02:25.072 --> 00:02:35.223
He kept that on as long as he could, and they designed all sorts of schools and public buildings and that sort of thing all over the state.

00:02:36.264 --> 00:02:44.013
I would travel with my father to look at the construction projects and to visit the various parts of the state.

00:02:47.397 --> 00:02:53.003
So I lived in Henderson, Texas for about three months was all because

00:02:53.337 --> 00:03:04.972
Although my father wanted to live there and continue working for the company that he was working for, my mother had no idea at all of living anyplace else besides San Antonio.

00:03:06.154 --> 00:03:12.182
So my father reluctantly moved back to San Antonio.

00:03:12.282 --> 00:03:19.632
And he opened a bookstore on Houston Street, sort of cat-a-corner to Wolf and Mark's

00:03:19.898 --> 00:03:20.959
department store.

00:03:22.161 --> 00:03:36.677
He picked the bookstore business because his father-in-law, George Roe, was already in the book business in the Roe Book Store on Commerce Street in San Antonio.

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.286
The first original Roe Book Store was at the corner of Commerce and St. Mary's.

00:03:44.907 --> 00:03:56.747
They sold that property, which they owned, to Alamo National Bank and moved about a block and a half away and opened there.

00:03:57.027 --> 00:04:08.586
And then the city of San Antonio had had a big flood in 1921 or thereabouts, and they decided to build a...

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:28.245
a pathway for any future floods and they would cut a canal from the bend in the San Antonio River at just about where it hit Commerce Street past the Plaza Hotel.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:42.070
And so the city of San Antonio bought my grandfather's bookstore, and they moved down the street again across the alley from the Alamo National Bank.

00:04:43.472 --> 00:04:49.521
And then later on, Alamo National Bank bought them out there and built a big parking garage.

00:04:50.462 --> 00:04:56.832
So I got some experience in the book business with both my father

00:04:57.098 --> 00:05:04.188
And with my grandfather, I would sell school books in my grandfather's store.

00:05:04.348 --> 00:05:10.316
My grandmother was the cashier, and she would save every Indian head penny that came along.

00:05:10.356 --> 00:05:18.708
And she had shoeboxes full of Indian head pennies, which are worth at least a whole $0.50 or a dollar apiece now.

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:26.278
But at any rate, the school rushes were a great time to be busy.

00:05:26.782 --> 00:05:35.416
and we made lots of book sales and it had to last for the whole part of the year because the rest of the year the book business was not too great.

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:48.418
My dad was also in the coin and stamp business and he sold coins and stamps to Will Noonan and others that had been in the business for many years.

00:05:49.883 --> 00:05:51.085
Eh, not Will Noonan.

00:05:52.066 --> 00:05:52.467
Brock.

00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:54.330
Brock.

00:05:55.612 --> 00:05:56.954
Mr. Brock, anyway.

00:05:58.857 --> 00:06:04.225
They were in that book business, not book business, in the stamp and coin business for many, many years.

00:06:06.609 --> 00:06:07.550
Which high school did you go to?

00:06:07.871 --> 00:06:17.005
I graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School, which was out on Donaldson Avenue in the northwest part of San Antonio.

00:06:17.474 --> 00:06:24.963
We had moved to this new house in about 1932, about the time everybody crashed.

00:06:25.804 --> 00:06:28.387
And my mother wanted to come back to her new house.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.590
It was on Club Drive.

00:06:31.792 --> 00:06:36.878
And we had a very, very nice group of people around us.

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:46.890
Alfred Lee and his brother, Royal B. Lee, were a couple of our neighbors.

00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:48.616
J.E.

00:06:48.676 --> 00:07:00.416
Melanson was another great neighbor and later both of those people were upperclassmen of mine at A&M in Sea Battery Coast Artillery.

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:07.427
I guess my earliest recollection of A&M was arriving with a footlocker.

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:12.334
to be carried upstairs to the assigned room.

00:07:12.354 --> 00:07:27.933
And once I'd carried it upstairs and had gotten a few more deep knee bends and push-ups done and carried a few more foot lockers for upperclassmen up, well, then we finally had a great night's rest because you couldn't do anything else.

00:07:28.373 --> 00:07:31.677
Had you visited A&M before coming to enroll?

00:07:32.112 --> 00:07:34.595
I don't recall that I had.

00:07:35.096 --> 00:07:39.622
What impression did you have of A&M before you got here?

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.046
What had you heard about it?

00:07:42.066 --> 00:07:43.367
What did you think about it?

00:07:43.387 --> 00:07:53.782
Well, I knew it was a men's school only, and I was of the opinion at that particular point in my life that girls and an education didn't mix.

00:07:54.583 --> 00:08:01.292
And then later on, of course, I found out that girls are part of an education and a very important part.

00:08:01.407 --> 00:08:06.161
So my attitude on girls at A&M changed.

00:08:07.325 --> 00:08:10.334
When you came with that footlocker, how did you get here?

00:08:11.518 --> 00:08:13.965
My father brought me in a car.

00:08:14.485 --> 00:08:17.471
What did you have in that footlocker?

00:08:18.574 --> 00:08:26.631
Had blue jeans and underwear and shoes and all that sort of thing.

00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:32.764
Of course, we then transferred to the Army

00:08:33.166 --> 00:08:33.948
clothes.

00:08:33.968 --> 00:08:50.010
We got issued shirts and pants and belts and we immediately started in onto our military science courses because we all wanted to be officers later on and we wanted to be in the ROTC and

00:08:50.716 --> 00:08:53.320
So that's another reason we came to A&M.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.545
I wanted to be an officer in the Reserves.

00:08:57.886 --> 00:09:00.049
And this was the fall of?

00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.710
1939.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:01.290
1939.

00:09:03.794 --> 00:09:11.965
Did your mother or your father give you any special advice as you were leaving that you remember?

00:09:14.797 --> 00:09:15.619
Just do good.

00:09:16.841 --> 00:09:20.768
Did you know at that time what you thought you wanted to major in?

00:09:21.249 --> 00:09:32.991
Well, I knew I wanted to be an engineer, and I thought I wanted to be a mechanical engineer rather than an electrical engineer, which was my Uncle Peter's area.

00:09:34.456 --> 00:09:43.909
I think I wanted to be, I knew, I know I wanted to be a mechanical engineer because Alfred Lee was my neighbor and so J.E.

00:09:43.969 --> 00:09:49.376
Melanson was a neighbor and they both had been in the mechanical engineering program.

00:09:50.638 --> 00:09:54.964
I lived in C Battery Coast Artillery.

00:09:55.004 --> 00:09:58.709
Now how did you, how did you get into Coast Artillery?

00:09:58.749 --> 00:10:00.852
How did you learn that was your outfit?

00:10:01.878 --> 00:10:03.643
Alfred Lee and J.E.

00:10:03.663 --> 00:10:04.445
Melanson.

00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:05.969
Oh, okay.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:06.992
In advance.

00:10:07.052 --> 00:10:08.276
In advance.

00:10:08.737 --> 00:10:17.541
They were from San Antonio, and Sea Battery Coast was a San Antonio battery in the Coastal Artillery.

00:10:17.977 --> 00:10:26.064
E Field Artillery was the San Antonio Battery and the Field Artillery part of the ROTC at A&M.

00:10:26.965 --> 00:10:31.469
They lived in the new dorm area where there were 12 new dormitories.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:40.237
I lived in Hart Hall where there was A Battery, B Battery, and C Battery, and D Battery.

00:10:41.338 --> 00:10:45.942
And then there were several other batteries that lived in Bazell across the military walk.

00:10:47.305 --> 00:10:54.754
Down at the end of Military Walk was our favorite auditorium.

00:10:55.234 --> 00:10:55.995
Guyon?

00:10:56.015 --> 00:11:01.501
Guyon Hall, which I might as well jump ahead a little bit.

00:11:02.302 --> 00:11:06.547
At graduation, my parents came to see me get my degree.

00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:14.376
And they were sitting in the audience as I walked across the stage to get my degree.

00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:32.168
I got this tube and I went back and sat down and opened up my tube and in it was not my degree but a bill for $1.57 for a broken window in the dormitory that they held me responsible for.

00:11:32.208 --> 00:11:36.033
But nobody told me in advance that if I paid that I could get my degree.

00:11:36.594 --> 00:11:39.739
They just told me I had to come pay it then I could get my degree.

00:11:40.698 --> 00:11:47.927
But at any rate, that was rather a disappointment for my parents to come all the way from San Antonio and not see a degree.

00:11:48.268 --> 00:11:59.302
What other, in terms of the physical campus, what other important structures were there for a freshman to notice on the campus?

00:11:59.322 --> 00:12:01.225
Oh, Sabisa.

00:12:01.245 --> 00:12:06.672
Sabisa was the mess hall, of course, and everybody had to march to

00:12:07.647 --> 00:12:13.533
Three meals a day, down military walk, have a military formation and march as a unit.

00:12:15.055 --> 00:12:30.972
At that time, we would sit at assigned tables and if you wanted any gun wadding, you had to, that was bread, and you had to ask for it by its proper name, gun wadding.

00:12:31.171 --> 00:12:34.855
If you wanted any dessert, you had to ask for kush.

00:12:35.656 --> 00:12:36.918
Were there kush questions?

00:12:37.058 --> 00:12:46.809
There were always kush questions, and you had to go through a certain hand operation to qualify for a serving of kush.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.152
What were some of the kush questions you remember?

00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:52.336
Oh, let's see.

00:12:53.878 --> 00:12:54.598
I don't remember.

00:12:57.141 --> 00:13:00.165
Describe the routine in your outfit

00:13:02.238 --> 00:13:08.287
of what it was like the first few weeks for a new fish in your outfit.

00:13:08.767 --> 00:13:22.347
A new fish always did calisthenics first thing in the morning, and we did quite a few deep knee bends whenever we didn't please an upperclassman in every aspect.

00:13:23.168 --> 00:13:24.550
I mean, it just seemed like

00:13:25.846 --> 00:13:39.229
get down and do a few knee bends and do a little duck walking up and down the steps and do a few push-ups, just as limbering up, you know, just to kind of get your mind going good.

00:13:41.212 --> 00:13:44.698
And we had to keep the

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:52.491
upperclassmen rooms cleaned and we had to bring them breakfast in the morning many times.

00:13:53.092 --> 00:13:59.542
We had to take their mail to the post office which was at the North Gate and behind Sabisa Hall.

00:13:59.642 --> 00:14:10.197
So bringing a bottle of milk and a few sweet rolls out from the mess hall was not, is not condoned by the

00:14:10.565 --> 00:14:13.449
by the administration, but we would do it anyway.

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:15.071
How would you hide the milk?

00:14:16.012 --> 00:14:17.714
Well, you could hide it in your socks.

00:14:18.896 --> 00:14:20.999
It was a small pint bottle.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:31.172
You'd just pull the socks out and stick it in there and put the sweet rolls around your belt or someplace like that.

00:14:31.878 --> 00:14:42.624
But if you didn't have the meal out there and properly displayed and everything, you did a few more knee bends and a few more pushups and that sort of thing.

00:14:42.704 --> 00:14:45.010
Did the paddle get used much in your outfit?

00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:47.411
The paddle got used quite a bit.

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:51.655
For what shortcomings?

00:14:51.695 --> 00:14:53.216
What crimes?

00:14:53.237 --> 00:14:54.438
For the same thing.

00:14:54.778 --> 00:15:00.304
Not being on time with the breakfast, not getting the mail delivered at the proper time.

00:15:01.425 --> 00:15:07.211
If they didn't get some mail once in a while, they got a little upset, too.

00:15:07.231 --> 00:15:10.374
And we'd have to write letters to their girlfriends and their parents.

00:15:11.915 --> 00:15:13.697
That was a lot of fun, too.

00:15:14.099 --> 00:15:19.831
At any rate, we had our own esprit within our class.

00:15:20.354 --> 00:15:21.983
What was your outfit's nickname?

00:15:23.498 --> 00:15:24.599
C Battery Coast.

00:15:24.619 --> 00:15:25.340
Oh it didn't have a?

00:15:25.721 --> 00:15:26.602
We didn't have a nickname.

00:15:26.662 --> 00:15:26.922
Oh okay.

00:15:28.124 --> 00:15:33.370
You were starting to say though- We would do drowned outs among our own class, you know.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:40.539
We'd sneak over to Bazell and drowned out some of our good friends.

00:15:40.619 --> 00:15:45.945
Jim Jennings was one of them.

00:15:47.157 --> 00:16:12.861
oh golly i can't remember what kind of punishment did somebody get if they got caught as part of a drownout deep knee bands and and some more push-ups and that sort of thing can you uh recall some of the favorite uh tricks or are uh good bull stunts y'all pulled off oh heck yeah man

00:16:12.976 --> 00:16:26.053
Of course, if you walked into the dormitory and if you happened to be over a hallway window and you didn't look up and see that trash can full of water coming down, you got drowned out right in front of your own dormitory.

00:16:27.094 --> 00:16:42.173
Then one of the favorite tricks that was sort of, it wasn't a favorite trick, but it was the favorite stunt that any of us pulled on anybody, I think, and it sort of became one of the legends

00:16:42.895 --> 00:16:49.182
in our outfit between us and D Battery Coast, which was Bum Bright's outfit.

00:16:49.943 --> 00:17:06.563
And we tied a wire between the bottom ramp on J ramp to the top floor on A ramp, which was D Battery's.

00:17:08.065 --> 00:17:11.569
And we tied this wire in the center of the screen

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.826
on Bumbright's window.

00:17:18.087 --> 00:17:37.354
And that night we hung a skyrocket on this wire and lit it and it went up the wire and went through the screen, broke the glass window, chased Herb Schiff and Bumbright around the room and lit on their bed and burned their blanket.

00:17:38.752 --> 00:17:45.149
So we really became quite famous from that.

00:17:45.771 --> 00:17:47.757
Did you all get caught?

00:17:48.759 --> 00:17:51.146
Oh, no, we never got caught.

00:17:51.908 --> 00:17:53.773
But George Thompson

00:17:54.226 --> 00:18:00.074
who was a mechanical engineer, favorite, Alphabet Thompson, he knew that we did it.

00:18:00.755 --> 00:18:02.037
But he didn't tell anybody.

00:18:02.318 --> 00:18:03.319
Was he a student then?

00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:04.901
No, he was a professor.

00:18:04.921 --> 00:18:06.263
Oh, he was already on the team.

00:18:06.724 --> 00:18:08.727
John George Hatch Thompson.

00:18:08.747 --> 00:18:09.167
Yes, yes.

00:18:09.568 --> 00:18:10.609
Alphabet Thompson.

00:18:11.631 --> 00:18:11.731
Yes.

00:18:11.751 --> 00:18:12.793
But he didn't turn us in.

00:18:14.976 --> 00:18:16.298
Your official lady.

00:18:17.419 --> 00:18:20.824
My old lady was Jo Fisher.

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:23.954
And also David Meyer.

00:18:24.575 --> 00:18:27.058
Describe them and the relationship you all developed.

00:18:27.078 --> 00:18:29.522
Well, Joe Fisher was from Victoria, Texas.

00:18:30.243 --> 00:18:33.447
David Meyer was from San Antonio, Texas.

00:18:33.467 --> 00:18:41.618
David Wilson Meyer, M-E-Y-E-R. And I don't think he was Jewish, but we called him A.B.

00:18:41.658 --> 00:18:43.281
And A.B.

00:18:43.361 --> 00:18:47.166
would get incensed at the fact we'd call him A.B.

00:18:47.922 --> 00:18:50.765
But he was a great guy and a great tennis player.

00:18:50.785 --> 00:18:53.208
I liked to play tennis with David very much.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:58.835
And Joe Fisher was just a wonderful big old Swede.

00:18:59.856 --> 00:19:04.382
And what was the routine for y'all at night in the room?

00:19:05.123 --> 00:19:07.486
Three in a room, how did you?

00:19:07.706 --> 00:19:08.507
Three in a room.

00:19:08.587 --> 00:19:11.791
That was quite a few to begin with.

00:19:11.911 --> 00:19:13.513
And later on, it was two in a room.

00:19:14.614 --> 00:19:16.917
But for the first

00:19:17.707 --> 00:19:24.293
The first few months, or maybe even for the first year, it was a whole, I mean, three people in a room.

00:19:26.094 --> 00:19:33.721
And we'd have to evacuate whenever there was a dance for the senior ring dance or the junior dance or that sort of thing.

00:19:33.761 --> 00:19:37.644
The girls would move into Hart Hall and we would just evacuate.

00:19:38.265 --> 00:19:39.706
Where did you all then sleep?

00:19:40.407 --> 00:19:42.949
We just doubled up with other people.

00:19:42.989 --> 00:19:43.870
In another dorm?

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.831
In another dorm.

00:19:44.871 --> 00:19:45.631
Sleep on the floor?

00:19:45.952 --> 00:19:47.393
Sleep on the floor.

00:19:47.947 --> 00:19:52.276
If people were going to be out of town, we'd sleep in their beds and that sort of thing.

00:19:53.399 --> 00:19:59.492
But Ralph Ricks was another one we drowned it out quite a bit over in Bazell Hall.

00:20:00.181 --> 00:20:03.466
all these guys turned out to be real good, close friends, you know.

00:20:03.506 --> 00:20:20.873
I mean, the bananas, the ripe bananas in the seniors' boots got us in trouble sometimes, and we'd get in trouble because we would be hauled out of town by some of the sophomores.

00:20:21.022 --> 00:20:25.569
And if we squealed on them, well, the sophomores would get us.

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:30.657
Describe that fall as you look back on it academically.

00:20:31.979 --> 00:20:40.893
What courses did you take, and were there some important professors and courses as you look back that you had that first year?

00:20:41.274 --> 00:20:46.101
Well, that first year we had slide rules as one of our courses.

00:20:46.385 --> 00:20:48.128
We had to learn to use the slide rule.

00:20:48.148 --> 00:20:50.632
We had mathematics, and we took calculus.

00:20:50.712 --> 00:21:04.053
And we had, well, I guess we had Texas history, because Texas history was very important in high school as well as in college.

00:21:05.375 --> 00:21:09.221
We had military science and that sort of thing as one of our courses.

00:21:09.962 --> 00:21:13.708
We had to learn the French 75 gun, as I recall.

00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:16.865
Who were some teachers you remember?

00:21:16.885 --> 00:21:17.506
Oh, guys.

00:21:18.067 --> 00:21:19.108
Old Sarge.

00:21:22.713 --> 00:21:23.634
I don't recall.

00:21:23.674 --> 00:21:26.277
I can't remember his name right now.

00:21:26.377 --> 00:21:28.800
What about in English or math?

00:21:32.645 --> 00:21:35.629
In math, Abbott.

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:37.790
Well, he was history, wasn't he?

00:21:38.151 --> 00:21:39.092
No, John Paul, English.

00:21:39.593 --> 00:21:40.475
English, okay.

00:21:41.056 --> 00:21:41.537
Well, wait a minute.

00:21:43.079 --> 00:21:46.886
I had Brooks Cofer for my English problem.

00:21:48.309 --> 00:21:56.002
And as a matter of fact, I got two Cs in my freshman year from Brooks Cofer as my English professor.

00:21:56.723 --> 00:22:01.752
They were the only two Cs that I made in my whole time at Texas A&M University.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:07.156
And his son, D.B.

00:22:07.176 --> 00:22:18.073
Cofer, Jr., always reminds me that, well, his father was very gracious, and he gave me two Cs.

00:22:18.093 --> 00:22:18.533
Anyway.

00:22:18.914 --> 00:22:19.415
Describe.

00:22:20.116 --> 00:22:28.488
I won a slide rule contest in the freshman year and got a watch for that.

00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:31.193
I won a math contest, or second.

00:22:31.213 --> 00:22:32.194
I came in math.

00:22:32.697 --> 00:22:44.055
In the math contest, I came in second, and Bill Atkinson, who was later with the State Department, I believe, he was an electrical engineer.

00:22:44.656 --> 00:22:48.121
He got first place, and I got second place.

00:22:50.185 --> 00:22:56.815
Did you and your buddies, did you all expect to be capable of handling the A&M curriculum?

00:22:57.236 --> 00:22:59.920
Were there a lot of Aggies that were scared they couldn't make it?

00:23:01.199 --> 00:23:09.128
We did coach people in slide rule, and we coached each other.

00:23:09.188 --> 00:23:13.773
And in your high school class, do you remember where you ranked?

00:23:14.915 --> 00:23:16.316
I don't remember where I ranked.

00:23:16.336 --> 00:23:18.198
Because there weren't any ACs.

00:23:18.318 --> 00:23:26.768
I was in the Honor Society, along with Adolph Specia and some of the other guys from San Antonio.

00:23:27.102 --> 00:23:33.610
And you here, if you made only two C's, then you never were close to flunking out or anything like that.

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:33.851
Never.

00:23:38.637 --> 00:23:41.340
Describe the routine of class day.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.764
What time did you get up and go to class?

00:23:44.264 --> 00:23:44.845
What happened?

00:23:45.085 --> 00:23:48.169
How did you all behave in class and so forth?

00:23:48.189 --> 00:23:51.994
Well, we had to get up and march to the Reveille.

00:23:52.214 --> 00:23:53.276
We got up at Reveille.

00:23:53.336 --> 00:23:55.759
The bugle blew at the

00:23:56.026 --> 00:24:02.336
bugle stand that was out by the YMCA building and Law and Puryear were over there.

00:24:03.597 --> 00:24:07.123
And then we would go to breakfast and come back.

00:24:07.623 --> 00:24:08.585
At Sabisa?

00:24:08.605 --> 00:24:09.286
At Sabisa.

00:24:09.306 --> 00:24:13.292
And then we'd come back and we would clean the upperclassmen's room

00:24:13.863 --> 00:24:18.128
see that he ate his breakfast well and was pleased and so forth and so on.

00:24:18.829 --> 00:24:22.893
Then we would get ourselves ready to go to class, and we'd go to class.

00:24:23.834 --> 00:24:26.658
And how did you and your buddies behave in class?

00:24:27.418 --> 00:24:28.920
We were well-behaved.

00:24:31.022 --> 00:24:42.115
I never will forget, of course, freshman chemistry, because we were in a very large group in an auditorium in the old chemistry building.

00:24:42.803 --> 00:24:51.856
And of course, you never will forget hydrogen sulfide as one of the test agents in some of your analytical chemistry.

00:24:53.318 --> 00:24:55.942
But we were very conscientious.

00:24:56.122 --> 00:24:58.105
Did you go to class regularly?

00:24:58.305 --> 00:24:59.567
We went to class regularly.

00:24:59.627 --> 00:25:00.468
We didn't skip.

00:25:02.211 --> 00:25:05.976
I guess some guys every now and then would have a good reason to skip.

00:25:06.867 --> 00:25:11.378
I think once in a while somebody might answer here for somebody that wasn't there.

00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:15.968
Did you all ever attempt any jokes, pranks in class?

00:25:17.472 --> 00:25:18.213
I don't recall.

00:25:18.233 --> 00:25:20.098
I haven't heard of any.

00:25:20.118 --> 00:25:24.488
I don't recall any.

00:25:24.856 --> 00:25:30.790
Did anybody pull the old thing, look to your left, look to your right, there's only going to be one of you here in two years?

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.015
I don't recall that either.

00:25:33.497 --> 00:25:34.298
That threat.

00:25:34.679 --> 00:25:36.043
I think that's been overdone.

00:25:36.383 --> 00:25:38.308
I think so.

00:25:40.448 --> 00:25:48.500
During that first year, did you begin to realize that you were reasonably well prepared for college, that your high school had...

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:48.940
Yes.

00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:52.125
Thomas Jefferson High School had some excellent teachers.

00:25:53.767 --> 00:26:01.258
Mary E. Hickman was my mathematics teacher and she got me started in geometry and

00:26:02.555 --> 00:26:05.739
plane geometry and solid geometry and that sort of thing.

00:26:07.121 --> 00:26:13.390
And I just, I remember Mr. Searcy, he was also a math professor.

00:26:14.932 --> 00:26:20.680
And of course, our dean of students was Ivey, Mr. Ivey.

00:26:21.942 --> 00:26:29.693
And I also recall getting kicked out of school the last day because we violated the

00:26:31.293 --> 00:26:36.388
the uniform code and we all went barefooted to school and that sort of thing.

00:26:36.408 --> 00:26:44.593
So we left school and we went swimming at San Marcos, I mean, at New Braunfels, rather.

00:26:45.012 --> 00:26:46.354
We just had a great ball.

00:26:46.534 --> 00:26:50.179
It was great getting kicked out of school.

00:26:50.199 --> 00:27:00.432
But here at A&M, how did you and your buddies, how did you all register for class after that first semester?

00:27:00.472 --> 00:27:02.394
Was it in Sabeasa?

00:27:02.655 --> 00:27:05.038
How did you all sign up for classes?

00:27:06.379 --> 00:27:12.387
We signed up for classes, I think it was in the old bookstore.

00:27:14.459 --> 00:27:16.181
I think it was in the old bookstore.

00:27:17.122 --> 00:27:26.172
And looking back on the first year or two, were there some courses that were really important to you?

00:27:26.212 --> 00:27:32.519
Well, I think machine design, of course, under Roy Wingren.

00:27:34.461 --> 00:27:35.903
Was he a fine teacher?

00:27:36.083 --> 00:27:37.064
He was a fine teacher.

00:27:37.104 --> 00:27:40.888
Describe his way of teaching.

00:27:42.337 --> 00:28:00.078
He would give you the part to design and he'd hand it to you and let you put in the fillets and put in the processes that you would think would be required to manufacture the device.

00:28:00.158 --> 00:28:04.783
And then he'd come around and show you that you had forgotten

00:28:04.966 --> 00:28:10.635
to consider this or that, and it was well done.

00:28:12.337 --> 00:28:29.404
He wouldn't be so critical that you'd just completely lose all confidence, but he would use his teaching experience and his pattern design and

00:28:29.755 --> 00:28:32.157
foundry and all those other good things.

00:28:32.298 --> 00:28:47.653
At that time, we took foundry and we took welding and we took machine design and machine processing of lathes and that sort of thing.

00:28:47.693 --> 00:28:59.205
In welding, electrical welding, first thing the prof did was have each of us stick our finger in a socket, an electric socket.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.224
And if you don't push it in too hard, you just get a tingle.

00:29:04.185 --> 00:29:14.757
And he wants you to know that if electricity won't hurt you unless under certain conditions like standing in water or something like that, it could kill you.

00:29:15.758 --> 00:29:17.220
All right, let's see here now.

00:29:18.762 --> 00:29:23.247
We did our ROTC down at the... Yeah, describe that.

00:29:23.868 --> 00:29:26.931
We would actually train as...

00:29:27.839 --> 00:29:34.528
as cannoneers, and we'd take dummy rounds of ammunition and ram them home.

00:29:35.869 --> 00:29:37.612
Did you all fire?

00:29:38.533 --> 00:29:38.753
No.

00:29:39.014 --> 00:29:40.736
Oh, you didn't ever fire the artillery?

00:29:40.756 --> 00:29:40.956
Never did.

00:29:41.857 --> 00:29:47.805
And we were supposed to, between our junior and senior year, go to

00:29:48.427 --> 00:29:54.115
a summer camp for two weeks to qualify for our commission.

00:29:54.656 --> 00:29:57.099
We'll get to that in a little bit, though.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.944
During that first fall, the war started in Europe.

00:30:01.966 --> 00:30:04.529
Did you and your buddies talk about that much?

00:30:04.589 --> 00:30:05.931
Did you listen to the radio?

00:30:06.372 --> 00:30:06.892
Oh, yeah.

00:30:08.434 --> 00:30:09.977
We sure knew what was going on.

00:30:10.137 --> 00:30:17.607
A lot of us would have to study with the radio on because there was so much noise, and otherwise you couldn't concentrate.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.623
What did y'all, you remember what you listened to?

00:30:20.683 --> 00:30:22.385
Music mostly.

00:30:22.445 --> 00:30:22.846
Okay.

00:30:23.927 --> 00:30:26.770
But you always got the news along with that.

00:30:28.032 --> 00:30:34.059
Did y'all talk about whether or not that war might involve the United States and involve y'all?

00:30:34.079 --> 00:30:34.600
Oh, sure.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:47.475
We talked about all those things, world events and submarines and minesweepers and military transports and

00:30:47.742 --> 00:30:57.471
We were very involved as far as current events and the current involvement in the World War II.

00:30:58.652 --> 00:31:03.457
Now, y'all, you did your military drills in the afternoon where?

00:31:04.418 --> 00:31:05.299
Where did y'all drill?

00:31:09.062 --> 00:31:16.990
Behind the petroleum engineering building was the
