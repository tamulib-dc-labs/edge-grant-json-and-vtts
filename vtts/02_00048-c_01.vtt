00:04.975 --> 00:10.463
45, 46,000 students.

00:10.664 --> 00:16.953
Only, what, 2,500 of them in the Corps, 
approximately. I don't know how many. You've got

00:18.496 --> 00:27.229
all those others that we need to get involved in 
leadership training, and that's one of the great

00:18.496 --> 00:27.229
things about A&M. We have it through these great 
student programs that are being conducted

00:29.275 --> 00:49.343
through the Manoa Student Center and we need to 
give more attention to this and more funds to this

00:29.275 --> 00:49.343
and more help uh in this area and uh if we don't doing 
it do it we're going to make sure that we we're we're

00:49.728 --> 01:18.199
not living up to uh the possibilities that this 
brings to us in my opinion let's see anything else

00:49.728 --> 01:18.199
yes keep going well stop in a minute so i can you know 
when I was in A&M. We had no art on the campus. There

01:24.635 --> 01:32.748
was very little thought of art, performing, or any 
other kind. We had Sully. We polished regularly by

01:35.011 --> 01:40.560
a great artist, Copini. But it was the only work of 
art besides folks here which a little later came

01:41.342 --> 01:46.650
along. were artists in residence and did great 
work in giving the college some touch of art but

01:46.917 --> 02:12.874
this was recognized and we formed during 
Vandiver's time as president a commission on the

02:13.276 --> 02:18.304
arts that was formed by him. And this was made up of 
several people, quite a few people who were

02:19.005 --> 02:24.393
leaders. George Connors, our friend in Dallas,

02:24.493 --> 02:42.000
Henry Gilchrist,

02:24.493 --> 02:42.000
John Lindsay, Sarah, Fort Mundeley was quite a few 
people in the group and some of the staff members

02:43.195 --> 03:11.532
and we met regularly and we decided we had to have a 
art gallery, we had to have a art museum, we had to

02:43.195 --> 03:11.532
have more art on the campus and with Jim, with Wayne 
Starks backing and help we got something rolling

02:43.195 --> 03:11.532
on that and we thought maybe we might break the ice 
with the

03:12.119 --> 03:26.273
great museum in Los Angeles.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.073
The old man. Getty. Huh? Getty? Yeah, Getty. We 
went out to see Getty Museum, talked to the

03:31.718 --> 03:41.367
director, and we hope that we might be able to, 
since he got most of his wealth from under Texas,

03:42.022 --> 03:52.217
that he might recognize that and give some of these 
countless billions, just a few million, to A&M. We

03:52.918 --> 04:04.595
never did accomplish that, but I think we could 
have had we followed it more

03:52.918 --> 04:04.595
seriously and concentrated more on it. But we 
didn't by concentrating on it. get the college to

04:11.519 --> 04:22.183
recognize we needed a gallery and put it in the path 
with the students and the Wayne Staub Gallery was a

04:11.519 --> 04:22.183
result. Plus, we've already talked about the 
great work that Wayne did along with Jim Reynolds

04:22.704 --> 04:31.283
and and others to bring the great collection of 
early American paintings

04:31.533 --> 04:44.626
built there on the campus of London. And we got a 
start, but in addition to that, through Opus, we

04:44.646 --> 04:58.860
have had some notable successes in bringing the 
Russian ballet there. That wasn't an accident.

05:01.773 --> 05:14.868
General Reynolds was responsible for going there 
and selling that and bringing those men to campus

05:01.773 --> 05:14.868
to see how fluent they was and what a great facility 
we had in the Rudder Auditorium.

05:16.570 --> 05:30.767
But we need more of that and we need to be,

05:16.570 --> 05:30.767
we need to get a art facility just like recently, I 
understand, through the system we've tied into

05:31.253 --> 05:37.539
with A&M at the law school in Houston. There's an 
art school we can tie into and have it tied in with us

05:37.559 --> 05:47.448
to give us some recognition in this area. Because 
one thing the graduates of A&M lacked was some of

05:48.088 --> 05:58.898
the need to know art and to what it is and have it part 
of your life. And the graduate back in those days

06:05.729 --> 06:13.499
and even today is not getting attention in that 
area that he should have. It's part of anybody's

06:14.119 --> 06:16.943
education. And we need to recognize that. Let's 
quit on that. Huh? Let's quit on that. Were you

06:24.572 --> 06:25.694
through there? Yes. All right. Thank you. Thank 
you. Dean Kyle, what did Dean Kyle mean to you? Dean

06:34.139 --> 06:43.855
Kyle was the Dean of Agriculture and known, I 
think, throughout this country and this world as a

06:34.139 --> 06:43.855
leader in agriculture. And he was part and parcel 
to most everything that went on at A&M because his

06:43.875 --> 06:56.475
voice was heard throughout the university. And he 
took a very active interest in everybody in the

06:57.080 --> 07:01.084
agricultural school. If I made the honor roll, I 
got a letter from him. And my folks got letters from

07:06.610 --> 07:08.712
him. And I have original copies if anybody wanted 
to see them. He was very personal. He made

07:18.182 --> 07:21.205
everything very personal. And later in life, when 
I went leaving Anderson-Clayton. I had to decide

07:28.167 --> 07:30.010
where I was going to go. This was right after I 
graduated and I told you the story about having to

07:30.030 --> 07:37.400
leave Anderson-Clayton because there was no work 
to do. I looked around. Dean Kyle was very active

07:40.344 --> 07:52.500
along with our old friend Sterling Evans and the 
Federal Land Bank, but Of course we named the

07:53.172 --> 07:57.419
school for him and I needn't have mentioned him.

08:04.872 --> 08:17.914
I mentioned polo, the Calvary and the romance of 
the Calvary and our polo teams when we were active

08:04.872 --> 08:17.914
regularly in that activity too.

08:23.716 --> 08:25.719
I was a Rhodes Scholar nominee. You never hear 
about a Rhodes Scholar at A&M, and I don't believe

08:27.782 --> 08:35.153
we've ever had a Rhodes Scholar. I don't even know 
who the Rhodes Scholar nominees were over the

08:35.293 --> 08:40.020
years. Do you? No. Somebody should look it up. 
There have been some nominees, but I don't know who

08:44.506 --> 08:50.635
they were.
