WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:02.982
It kept me going, you know. Regardless if I like to 
do what I'm doing, I just did it. Because that was my

00:06.126 --> 00:07.108
job. Yeah, it was my job. Well, let's talk about 
this occupation duty as far as it's concerned.

00:16.520 --> 00:27.675
Here you are, first lieutenant in charge of a 
hundred thousand white Russians in Austria in

00:16.520 --> 00:27.675
three different camps. How were part of your 
functions and duties not only to take care of those

00:27.976 --> 00:38.528
people as far as health, clothing, et cetera, but 
also ordering food? And tell me about your staff.

00:41.271 --> 00:46.176
Yeah, well, we had the artillery battalion staff. 
See, I was the battalion headquarters commander.

00:52.043 --> 00:57.949
And of course, at my disposal, I had the whole staff 
to work with. headquarter staff. So I had enough

01:00.119 --> 01:01.380
help. I had plenty of help. Ordering the food, no 
problem. The staff did it. And I supervised the

01:08.150 --> 01:09.612
staff. Okay, now you said that these people were 
really rather pathetic. Their human condition

01:13.277 --> 01:16.341
was pathetic. What did they think of the 
Americans? Oh, they liked the Americans. They

01:23.091 --> 01:23.491
did. These were people like me and you. You know, 
they They respected the Americans. They had great

01:32.342 --> 01:33.243
respect. I'd walk into these DP camps, and they 
were very, not because of the military, but

01:33.363 --> 01:41.311
because of them being American. And I didn't 
really have time to communicate with a lot of them,

01:42.372 --> 01:49.159
talk to them, or visit with them, because we were 
too damn busy. Like you say, getting medicine,

01:50.260 --> 01:57.467
food, clothing, getting them broken down into 
families, and getting them all together. and make

01:57.970 --> 02:05.141
sure the boxcars were available and make sure 
transportation was on time and stuff like this.

02:06.263 --> 02:21.688
And so I didn't really have time to, as much as I 
wanted to, was to get out and visit with them and see

02:06.263 --> 02:21.688
where they're from and what kind of work they did 
or, you know, just try to find something out about

02:06.263 --> 02:21.688
them. Just didn't have the time. Or probably very 
few of them spoke English anyway. No, they didn't

02:28.619 --> 02:30.422
speak English at all. Only the girls spoke 
English. Oh, really? Yeah, the girls we'd run

02:32.626 --> 02:34.950
across, you know, in camp. I'm talking about 19,

02:35.170 --> 02:40.859
20, 21-year-old girls. And there were plenty of 
them. There weren't many men. Most of them were

02:44.545 --> 02:45.246
women. Most of these were women? Women, yeah. Of 
course the men were... Dead. Dead, yeah. And so...

02:54.957 --> 02:56.098
And kids, of course. They had kids while they were 
there. They intermarried and developed

02:59.462 --> 03:02.945
families. They'd been there five, six years. 
Sure. And seven years. And so we had to get them all

03:07.109 --> 03:12.455
processed and get them out of there. Now, how did 
you go about processing them? You got their name

03:14.257 --> 03:20.964
and where they were supposedly from and their 
citizenship and just basic paperwork on them?

03:20.984 --> 03:23.706
Well, we sent them to Linz, Austria. And Linz would 
We'd put them in, actually, we'd put them on trucks

03:25.501 --> 03:37.136
and send them in to Lynn's, and Lynn's division 
headquarters there would put them in the boxcars

03:25.501 --> 03:37.136
and get them on the trains and send them back. So we 
had a certain procedure we followed. And were the

03:44.006 --> 03:47.290
camps like dormitories with barbed wire around? 
Oh yeah, barbed wire. Actually, they were the

03:49.172 --> 03:53.398
regular labor camps. But the Germans, we just went 
in there and cleaned them up. When I got there, it

03:58.121 --> 04:00.904
was all set up. They had cleaned up the camps and 
modernized them and had medical facilities

04:00.924 --> 04:08.854
available and everything. Started feeding these 
people. Oh, yeah. See, when I got there, they'd

04:15.062 --> 04:20.449
already been set up and ready to go. So they just 
took over the same slave labor camps that the

04:20.716 --> 04:26.265
people were already in. And what kind of work were 
they doing? Agricultural? Agriculture work,

04:29.750 --> 04:34.438
road work, just whatever. During the day and night 
they put them back in the camps. Up in the

04:38.204 --> 04:40.527
mountains. Cumberland Mountains they called it. 
Well actually part of the Alps. They called them

04:44.714 --> 04:48.580
the Cumberland area. Now, did any of them try to, 
realizing what their fate would be in the Soviet

04:49.133 --> 04:55.699
Union, did any of them try to escape? Oh, yeah, that 
was our problem. That's what we used all the men

04:57.101 --> 04:59.543
for, was to guard the camps. Yeah, they tried. I 
don't blame them. I really don't blame them. Were

05:05.088 --> 05:06.470
they ever successful? Some of them got away, and of 
course we'd have to go try to find them. Some of them

05:13.536 --> 05:16.059
we brought back, and some of them we just couldn't 
find. Oh, yeah. We couldn't understand why we were

05:19.711 --> 05:21.714
sending them back. Just couldn't understand it. 
Yeah, and this is a big dilemma. It is. And of

05:25.500 --> 05:30.427
course, like I said, my A&M training, you know, 
it's a job, and we had to do it. Had to go through it.

05:32.671 --> 05:33.833
But we had a treaty with the Soviets. Yeah, we had a 
treaty. We knew that. But we couldn't understand

05:36.116 --> 05:37.478
the treaty. Why did Roosevelt get us into this 
situation? Or Eisenhower?

05:45.192 --> 05:51.881
The reason behind this is so we could have our 
prisoner wars or anybody that the Russians

05:45.192 --> 05:51.881
captured back. That was the idea. So it was 
supposed to be a trade-off. Of course there were a

05:56.206 --> 06:01.072
lot more Russians on our side than there were 
Americans on their side. But there were some

06:01.092 --> 06:04.997
Americans and they wanted those back. But they 
wanted the white Russians back. And the

06:07.681 --> 06:08.682
Ukrainians. Ukrainians and the Slovaks and the 
Polaks and anything they could. You know, oh yeah.

06:15.110 --> 06:21.300
Romanians, we found a battalion of Romanian SS 
troopers in a camp. Yeah, they were just living.

06:22.521 --> 06:23.002
They didn't care. The war was over. They were just, 
they stacked their arms and they made camp. And so

06:32.176 --> 06:34.780
they were a whole battalion of them. So I went back 
and told the colonel, I said, there's a whole

06:34.800 --> 06:37.845
battalion of SS troopers up there. Where, where, 
where? I said, up there in the mountains. So we went

06:40.108 --> 06:41.811
up there and I turned over the colonel. I don't know 
what the hell he did with them. They finally sent

06:46.872 --> 06:53.862
them to PW camp because they were SS troopers. But 
they weren't bothering anybody. They were just

06:58.289 --> 06:59.511
sitting there living. They knew the war was over. 
So they were smart. In fact, you couldn't find any

07:04.117 --> 07:08.444
arms. They had taken them and stacked them and put 
them in a in a storeroom and locked them up so nobody

07:12.858 --> 07:16.984
had arms. So when the colonel went up there with the 
MPs,

07:17.585 --> 07:36.635
I don't know, they just joined them, you know, and 
next thing I knew they'd moved them all out to

07:17.585 --> 07:36.635
Williams, Austria, to P.W. Cage. It was funny.

07:43.368 --> 07:46.171
Now did you ever come in contact with the Russian 
troops? Only in Czechoslovakia. Now you were with

07:49.955 --> 07:55.881
the Eighth Armored, and this is the one that went 
into Czechoslovakia but didn't liberate Prague,

07:49.955 --> 07:55.881
is that right? That's right. And you stood on the 
outskirts, or can you describe that situation? We

08:00.406 --> 08:02.629
went to Pilsen and stopped. We stopped at Pilsen. 
See, first we went to the Elbe River, and then they

08:04.050 --> 08:10.557
stopped us at Elbe and sent us into the Harts 
Mountain. And we fought there the Hitler-Jugend.

08:14.190 --> 08:18.513
And we tried to find that underground railroad 
they were supposed to have, but we never did find

08:14.190 --> 08:18.513
it. And then the war was over. So then they sent us to 
Czechoslovakia. In the meantime, Patton had gone

08:25.620 --> 08:31.865
into Czechoslovakia and liberated them and gone 
up towards Prague. And Eisenhower stopped him,

08:32.506 --> 08:37.410
told him not to go into Prague. That was Russia. He 
said, well, hell, I'm going to take Prague. He

08:40.653 --> 08:41.033
said, no. So he pulled him back, and they had a line 
drawn between Pilsen and Prague, and that was it.

08:47.466 --> 08:56.275
And where we'd see the Russians was, they'd come 
into Pilsen to buy, and they were tourists.

08:58.378 --> 09:00.340
Because we couldn't go into Prague. They wouldn't 
let us go over there, but the Russians are. And a lot

09:02.682 --> 09:06.987
of them came in with knapsacks, five years of pay. 
Never got paid till the war was over, and they had

09:08.249 --> 09:13.817
five years of money in their knapsack. So they were 
buying everything. Mickey Mouse watches, $100,

09:16.060 --> 09:20.065
$200 a piece. And you could buy them for $2.50 in the 
country. But they would buy cigarettes, $100 a

09:23.570 --> 09:26.674
carton. Really? Oh, they were giving money away. 
And the G.I.s would just sell them a Jeep. And then

09:34.962 --> 09:43.435
report it stolen, and when they get to the 
checkpoint, the American MPs would confiscate

09:34.962 --> 09:43.435
the jeep and send the Russians on back. Oh, yeah. 
They had money, five years of pay. My goodness. And

09:48.262 --> 09:51.206
the Czechoslovakians did not want them in there. 
No. No. Hated them. Didn't want them. And so then we

09:55.292 --> 09:56.955
were ordered out of there. It was July, early July, 
somewhere. First of all. Early July, yeah. Yeah,

10:01.221 --> 10:03.124
we were ordered out of there. And the Czechs cried. 
Didn't want us to leave. We were good to them. We

10:10.213 --> 10:11.354
brought food in. We brought medicine in. And we 
shared it. We stayed in the homes. Oh, did you? Oh,

10:17.564 --> 10:17.944
yeah. We lived in the homes. It's like you move in 
here with me. Really? Yeah. That's where we lived.

10:23.513 --> 10:24.454
We lived in the homes. What did they think of that? 
They loved it. We loved it. Yeah, we were living in

10:28.740 --> 10:32.526
homes instead of in tents on the ground. They 
cooked meals for us. Oh, they cooked meals for you?

10:36.541 --> 10:37.743
Oh, yeah, they cooked meals for us. But we had our 
own mess tent. And would you buy the meals? Oh, we'd

10:40.446 --> 10:41.788
give them money. We'd bring them food. They 
couldn't get beer. Pilsen, Czechoslovakia had

10:47.596 --> 10:52.903
the biggest brewer in Europe, and they couldn't 
get the beer. Why was that? They wouldn't give the

10:54.606 --> 10:56.889
civilians any alcohol. But we could get the beer. 
So we'd get the beer we wanted, and then... give it

11:04.096 --> 11:07.521
to our Czechoslovakia friends. In fact, we'd 
throw parties for them. Let them throw the party,

11:08.903 --> 11:11.386
and we'd furnish the food. And we'd do all the 
Slavic dances. Oh, they loved us. They loved us.

11:18.637 --> 11:22.402
When I left, they brought flowers out to me. People 
I lived with named Trojan cried, gave me a vase full

11:23.584 --> 11:29.232
of flowers. I still got the vase. They cried. They 
loved it. They loved us. And I used to correspond

11:35.213 --> 11:37.996
with them when I got back to the States. And 
finally, a letter got out that says, please don't

11:39.919 --> 11:45.145
write us. No kidding? That's right. The Russians 
wrote it. That was after 48? Right. Oh, yeah. The

11:53.395 --> 11:57.300
Russians were really giving them hell. So if they 
were communicating with Americans, they were

11:57.320 --> 12:02.066
Russians. I don't know what they did to them. 
People I lived with at Trojan's had a baker shop

12:04.306 --> 12:09.053
downstairs, and we lived upstairs. It was fun, I 
tell you. I had fresh pastry and rolls and bread.

12:14.540 --> 12:16.943
That must have been welcoming after being on the 
road. Oh, it really was. It really was.

12:23.753 --> 12:25.034
You say they hated the Russians. They really did. 
What were your opinions? Did you have any, besides

12:29.461 --> 12:33.486
just seeing the Russians, What were your 
impressions? Do you remember other Russians?

12:37.353 --> 12:43.862
Well, I never did really run across any of them 
except I'd see them in Pilsen. I stayed clear of

12:43.882 --> 12:44.804
them. You know, I knew what they were and so I 
stayed, I didn't try to get involved with any, talk

12:45.605 --> 12:55.779
with them, drink with them. I just... Did many men 
do that? Well, yeah, the men did. They'd just buy

13:01.664 --> 13:05.169
them drinks and stuff. I don't think- So their 
relations were pretty good? Pretty good, yeah.

13:07.813 --> 13:08.775
They were good in Pillson. We didn't have any 
trouble with them at all. I'd go to the clubs, and

13:11.559 --> 13:16.947
the Russians would be there with the men, 
drinking, socializing. So it was good. No problem

13:18.449 --> 13:20.612
at all. But I can't recall any

13:21.854 --> 13:28.424
vis-a-vis with the Russians. What's that?

13:35.043 --> 13:46.039
You know, I was wondering that they would put you in 
charge of an occupation camp or a displaced person

13:35.043 --> 13:46.039
camp with your Greek background. Do you think that 
had anything to do with it? I mean, the fact that you

13:49.043 --> 13:53.349
were a European background? European 
background? Yeah. I don't believe that. Or was it

13:55.652 --> 13:56.674
just because of you? Just because of my job being 
the headquartered commandant. I was

14:00.139 --> 14:04.645
headquartered commandant of the battalion, and 
that was my job. Okay. Do you want to move on now to,

14:07.566 --> 14:12.311
would you have to go now? I'm going to have to go. 
Yeah, I need to go to the office. Okay, fine. Okay,

14:16.495 --> 14:19.237
then we can talk tomorrow morning. We can start on 
when you are released from active duty, or we can

14:19.277 --> 14:26.244
finish up anything else you want to talk about on 
active duty. Tomorrow? Tomorrow morning. Yeah.

14:28.966 --> 14:29.367
Okay. Yeah, let's do that tomorrow. You want to 
come back tonight?

14:37.649 --> 14:38.290
All right. This is a second interview with General 
Mike P. Kokonos, and today is June 2, 1981. Last

14:46.019 --> 14:51.586
time we were talking, and I think pretty much 
finished up your active wartime career. I was

14:51.606 --> 14:57.834
wondering if you had thought of anything else that 
you might want to mention before we move on to your

14:51.606 --> 14:57.834
reserve career. I can't recall of anything that I 
think of something later. Okay, fine. Then let's

15:05.183 --> 15:06.525
go to your reserve. Period. And what rank were you 
when you left? When did you get out? When were you

15:14.383 --> 15:15.344
discharged? And what rank? From the reserve? No, 
from the active duty. I was discharged as a captain

15:19.848 --> 15:22.009
in 1946. Okay. July of 1946, I was discharged as a 
captain at Fort Sam Houston. Okay, so they sent you

15:29.676 --> 15:30.997
back there. Right. All right. Had you given any 
thought as a captain? Had you given any thought at

15:35.501 --> 15:37.002
all to stay in the military and make it a career? 
None at all. I had not thought about it. I wanted to

15:42.535 --> 15:53.572
get home and try to

15:42.535 --> 15:53.572
pick up where I left off from school and get back 
into medical school. And that was my main

15:54.233 --> 16:00.602
objective was to try to get back into medical 
school. Did you think at that time that you would

16:01.063 --> 16:06.651
ever have the possibility of staying in the 
reserves and becoming general? No, did not. Never

16:09.756 --> 16:13.621
entertained the idea of it. And I

16:13.781 --> 16:18.749
liked the Army. I thought it was good. But I thought 
that at the time that I served well and felt good

16:20.451 --> 16:33.670
about it, and so I was just going to come home and 
become a good civilian and go to medical school.

16:33.690 --> 16:34.191
OK. Now, in 1947, you organized the 143rd Reserve 
National Guard. Were you authorized to do that?

16:42.644 --> 16:43.465
Tell me about that. How did you create that, and who 
else was involved? Could you tell me that story?

16:48.529 --> 17:02.862
Yes, I was sitting at home one afternoon on Hazel 
Street, and Harold Simmons, who's a first

16:48.529 --> 17:02.862
sergeant in the regular army, and he is since now 
deceased, came to me and he said, Mike, we're

17:03.280 --> 17:10.351
trying to organize a National Guard company here 
in Beaumont. Are you interested in being part of

17:11.873 --> 17:14.618
it? I told him I really wasn't. I just didn't feel 
that, you know, I was ready. I'd just come out of the

17:20.667 --> 17:25.735
Army and I just didn't feel like participating in 
the National Guard. I really didn't know too much

17:26.737 --> 17:28.860
about the Guard. I'd heard the reserves were All I 
knew was reserves, but the guard, as I found out,

17:31.192 --> 17:38.599
was state troops and commanded by the governor. 
Anyway, he persuaded me to organize an infantry

17:39.760 --> 17:52.932
company, H Company, of the 143rd, which was a heavy 
weapons company, machine guns, mortars, and

17:39.760 --> 17:52.932
rockets. And so we organized at the downtown YMCA. 
It was in the gym, and it was 12 of us. Twelve of us got

18:00.453 --> 18:24.434
it started, and some of the men were Harold 
Simmons, of course, Clark Phippen,

18:00.453 --> 18:24.434
P-H-I-P-P-E-N, and Lee Quisenberry, who 
incidentally, Lee came to me as a carpal at that

18:00.453 --> 18:24.434
time and stayed with me during my whole career and 
was my sergeant major wherever I went. I took him

18:25.134 --> 18:29.498
with me, and he has died about a year ago. So we lost 
Lee with a heart attack. But Harold Summons, and we

18:33.361 --> 18:40.489
had the former mayor of Beaumont, Lowry, that was 
in there. But anyway, we got organized. And we had

18:41.650 --> 18:45.814
to do it all ourselves. I mean. What about the 
politics of this? Well, at the time, I didn't know

18:49.718 --> 18:52.421
anything about the politics. Didn't realize that 
the National Guard had politics in it. Probably

18:56.445 --> 18:58.607
wouldn't have gotten involved if I'd known it. I 
really didn't know too much about the Guard. We

19:02.404 --> 19:03.145
were never told. I mean, well, I never knew 
anything about the Guard or the Reserve because I

19:03.205 --> 19:08.152
was always in. Activity. Yeah, activity or in 
school and never concerned myself with it. But I

19:15.522 --> 19:24.273
remember my older brother, Janelle, was in the 
CMTC,

19:15.522 --> 19:24.273
but they called it the Guard then. He went to a guard 
camp one year when I remember as a kid. CMTC. A

19:28.490 --> 19:30.412
civilian military training corps. I take it back. 
He didn't get in the CMTC. He got into the National

19:32.974 --> 19:34.675
Guard. It was C Company, the Guard, here in 
Beaumont. And so he went to camp. And he went to camp

19:40.600 --> 19:44.804
in somebody else's place and used their name. So 
that's the only thing I remember about the Guard.

19:48.327 --> 19:50.709
We organized the H Company. And I went to the city 
and asked them to help us secure a place to train. So

19:57.650 --> 20:01.415
they said they would let us use the fairgrounds. 
And we went to the fairgrounds, and we took over a

20:02.497 --> 20:06.122
building. And then the guard bureau, the state 
guard bureau, gave us some money to put in some

20:06.142 --> 20:13.312
wooden offices and stuff. So that's where we got 
started. So you got money from the state bureau in

20:15.815 --> 20:19.300
Austin? Austin. They helped us to build the armor. 
to put our weapons, our guns in. Where'd you get the

20:28.400 --> 20:29.341
guns? They, Texas, the National Guard sent them to 
us. They were carbines and machine guns and also

20:32.806 --> 20:42.478
Recarless rifles. And, but we got started. First 
thing you know, we had a full complement. Really?

20:49.707 --> 20:50.007
Yes. How many men then? We had about 110 men. And 
that's what they, that was the, Guard limit.

20:57.687 --> 21:02.732
Infantry Company is much larger on active duty, 
but they allowed us up to 110, and we had 110. And in

21:02.772 --> 21:18.228
fact, one of my men, who lives in College Station 
right now, retired from the Army after I helped him

21:02.772 --> 21:18.228
get into West Point through the Guard, Charlie 
Zip. He was standing in ranks one day, and a message

21:18.248 --> 21:23.614
came down from Guard Bureau, says, anybody wants 
to go to West Point in your unit, just let us know. So

21:27.464 --> 21:31.089
I asked Charlie Zipper, would he be interested in 
going to the military academy? He said, never

21:31.469 --> 21:32.430
heard of it. Didn't know anything about it. Well, 
after discussing it with his mother, he come back

21:34.413 --> 21:38.539
and says, yes, I'd like to give it a try. And through 
competitive tests, he was selected, made a career

21:38.559 --> 21:43.826
in the Army. And now he's retired. I think he 
retired as a colonel. He lives in Bryan. And of

21:50.275 --> 21:53.179
course, He, every time he sees me, he just always 
thanks me for helping him. And Terry, I get this all

21:59.468 --> 22:02.091
the time now. I see young kids. Oh, it really is. I 
see young men today, and they come up to me, and

22:04.413 --> 22:13.482
they'll say, General, don't you remember when I 
was in your unit in the Guard? And now here he is, a

22:13.582 --> 22:16.706
doctor. Giglio lives around the corner. He's just 
one, for example. He's a doctor. He was in my unit.

22:22.792 --> 22:23.894
He says, you helped me out. He says, you really did, 
you know. But anyway, we went on. The guard company

22:28.681 --> 22:30.344
was organized. Now, you didn't want to do it. Here 
we are in 1947. The nation's army is demobilizing.

22:37.094 --> 22:41.741
We have 12 million men in the armed forces in 1945 
and 1947. We have a million and a half. So

22:44.005 --> 22:45.767
everybody's leaving the service. Yet you people 
decide to set up a military base station. Now, why

22:52.377 --> 22:56.181
is that? I guess we're deep, deep rooted in 
protecting our country. We felt that we, after we,

23:01.628 --> 23:13.041
Sergeant Simmons and I, we talked about it and 
that's what convinced me that we needed to have

23:01.628 --> 23:13.041
some kind of militia or reserve. We knew everybody 
was demobilizing and what would the army be?

23:17.406 --> 23:18.567
Probably nothing, so We needed some kind of 
reserve in case something did happen

23:18.901 --> 23:27.769
immediately, and that motivated me to take over 
this company. Did you ever think that the

23:28.189 --> 23:41.121
Russians, Soviets, who at one time were a great 
ally during 1945, then by 1947 in the Truman

23:28.189 --> 23:41.121
Doctrine were our great nemesis, did you ever 
think that that might have had some influence?

23:41.301 --> 23:46.866
Yes, that certainly did, because I knew way back 
during the war the Russians were not high. true

23:47.437 --> 23:48.218
allies. They were, in fact, for a little bit of an

23:49.079 --> 23:59.530
order from Eisenhower, we would have turned and 
fought the Russians. The Germans would have

24:00.691 --> 24:01.853
helped us. They said so. They surrendered to us. 
And so that was in the back of my mind when we

24:04.716 --> 24:09.061
organized the National Guard Company. The 
Russians may want to try to do something now that

24:09.821 --> 24:15.047
we're demobilizing, because they weren't 
demobilizing. No, no, they weren't demobilizing

24:15.753 --> 24:17.495
at all. We knew that. In fact, they were in 
Czechoslovakia, in Poland. They were going to get

24:25.524 --> 24:26.946
into Poland then. And so we knew they weren't 
demobilizing. They were in Vienna. And so that,

24:31.191 --> 24:39.520
when Simmons talked to me about it, that excited me 
to just do something. Another aspect about the

24:40.141 --> 24:44.646
National Guard and about the reserves in general 
is is many times officers had to buy their own

24:44.980 --> 24:48.464
uniforms. They had to buy their own equipment. 
They didn't get paid. Tell me about how that worked

24:51.848 --> 24:54.712
as far as, did you get paid? Tell me about how that 
worked. I'm trying to remember if I really got paid

24:58.136 --> 25:00.138
or not. It really didn't make any difference. Yes, 
we did receive, we received, we drilled 48 drills,

25:02.982 --> 25:13.114
but we only got paid for half, if I remember 
correctly. for 24 drills. And then, of course, any

25:15.663 --> 25:19.108
staff meetings or anything like that, and travel, 
we did it ourselves. And went

25:19.969 --> 25:25.297
to summer camp, of course, we got paid.

25:28.081 --> 25:29.103
Is that the way it is today? Or do you get paid for 
every drill? You get paid for every drill. And it's

25:33.229 --> 25:34.230
an extra drill. If you have extra drills, you get 
paid for it. Oh, sure. And they pick up your travel,

25:36.394 --> 25:38.477
too, don't they? Pick up your travel. They'd pick 
up, as a general officer, when I used to travel

25:39.807 --> 25:46.676
around the country visiting the units, they paid 
for that. They paid per diem, which was good. Now,

25:51.022 --> 25:52.023
it's an odd thing. No, they didn't pay us the same 
per diem. They paid the active Army people. It was a

25:55.668 --> 25:56.389
little less. But I think now it's stabilized and 
standard. They pay everybody the same. But in the

26:01.536 --> 26:06.924
Guard days, we had to make ship. You know, if we 
wanted to We needed stationery. We'd get our own

26:10.087 --> 26:12.751
stationery and typewriter. We'd get our own 
typewriter. Of course, the Guard didn't have

26:15.675 --> 26:17.217
anything. They furnished the guns and ammunition 
for rifle practice. And what kind of training did

26:22.485 --> 26:23.867
you have? We had regular infantry training out at 
the fire grounds.

26:36.745 --> 26:38.367
Basically marching and drilling? The basic 
training, yeah, the squad drills. It was basic

26:43.953 --> 26:48.057
training because we really had recruits in our... 
There were a few veterans, Bill Selvin,

26:48.077 --> 26:52.582
Lieutenant Selvin, Lieutenant Engman. They were 
all veterans, and they'd come out, they'd join.

26:56.886 --> 26:57.907
It's a funny thing, Terry. At the time, we were 
organized, and when I'd go around asking officers

26:58.027 --> 27:04.134
to join, they were willing to join. I mean, I didn't 
have much resistance as we do today, you know, You

27:08.536 --> 27:21.013
talk to an officer who comes with a lack of duty and 
tell him to get in reserve, and it doesn't excite

27:08.536 --> 27:21.013
him at all until it's too late, like 20 years later. 
They tell me, well, why didn't you make me get in the

27:21.954 --> 27:24.217
reserve? I see them today, my age, you know. Well, 
why didn't you make me stay in the reserve? Why

27:28.603 --> 27:30.025
didn't you make me make my 20? But at that time, we 
didn't have any problem getting officers to. And

27:35.312 --> 27:37.395
we went to Fort Hood by train. We left here at 
midnight and got in Fort Hood about 24 hours later.

27:42.878 --> 27:47.302
It took us that long to go from Beaumont to Fort Hood 
by train. And we used one of the baggage cars for our

27:48.444 --> 27:55.331
mess haul. And so we cooked the meals on the train. 
But we got to summer camp. It was good. We had

28:03.640 --> 28:04.922
realistic training. Who trained you? We trained 
ourselves. There wasn't any active army people

28:11.769 --> 28:15.254
advising or anything. We just laid out our 
training schedules and went to the field. But no

28:20.962 --> 28:23.786
active army people in training. Was there a lot of 
tension between the active and the reservists? At

28:30.175 --> 28:30.756
that time? No, because they weren't really 
involved with us as much as they are today. And I was

28:38.497 --> 28:42.021
in the 36th division. General Ainsworth was 
commanding general, Miller Ainsworth. My

28:47.388 --> 28:50.071
regimental commander was General Ives. And we 
trained well, very well. Because you know, we come

28:56.679 --> 28:59.122
out of active army, combat. We trained like 
combat. And we played like combat. You know, at

29:05.550 --> 29:07.913
night, officers club time. Captain Wheeler was a 
headquarter commandant, and he and I were good

29:08.298 --> 29:13.104
friends at A&M. He was in combat and I was in combat. 
By the way, what's his name, Artie Murphy? Yeah,

29:19.391 --> 29:21.093
Artie Murphy, the most decorated, yeah. Yeah, he 
was on our staff. Really? At 36th Division. And

29:25.418 --> 29:29.503
Artie and I became very good friends because we 
played ping pong at night. No kidding? That's

29:29.963 --> 29:31.305
right. And M.B. Etheridge from Huntsville had 
more decorations than Marty Murphy, except he

29:36.547 --> 29:43.494
didn't get the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
Marty Murphy and M.B. Ethers were both in the third

29:44.976 --> 29:46.578
division. And M.B. is now chairman of the bank in 
Huntsville. Oh, great guy, colorful, little

29:50.322 --> 29:53.385
shark fellow. And he had, I had H company, he had C 
company. Marty Murphy was on the staff, and at

29:58.951 --> 30:02.014
night, So Audie Murphy stayed in the reserves? 
Stayed in the reserves. I know then he went to

30:05.632 --> 30:06.853
movies. Then he went to the movies. He stayed in 
there two years. Went to Fort Hood one year and went

30:09.336 --> 30:15.704
to Fort Polk the next year and then he went to the 
movies. What kind of person was Audie Murphy? Very

30:17.305 --> 30:20.870
quiet, nice, just pleasant as he can be. And we 
played ping pong. We'd go to the officer's club and

30:23.573 --> 30:30.381
they had this ping pong table so we'd play ping pong 
and talk and visit. just ordinary, quiet, he was

30:31.171 --> 30:37.520
more of an introvert than he was an extrovert. And 
of course all the recruits when they, Artie,

30:37.540 --> 30:44.390
that's what his job was to come out and recruit 
training. Recruits would come out there and

30:44.951 --> 30:51.059
they'd see Artie Murphy, boy they just, everybody 
was thrilled that he would be there. And he did a

30:52.081 --> 30:58.410
good job for the Texas National Guard.

30:59.487 --> 31:01.309
It's sad, you know, he died. When did he die? I know 
he made a couple of movies, and then what happened?

31:05.232 --> 31:05.813
Do you remember? I don't. Did he become an 
alcoholic? Yeah, he and his wife had problems, and

31:10.357 --> 31:20.747
I think he crashed an airplane, no, an automobile 
crashed. It's been so long, I just can't remember.

31:25.692 --> 31:27.233
But he sure was a fine fellow.

31:30.267 --> 31:38.434
Well, let's move to your reserve duties and start 
tracing your reserve career. So from 1947 to 1956,

31:39.235 --> 31:43.739
you were with the 143rd. Right. I got promoted to 
major. Oh, so you moved up. I moved up as the

31:47.322 --> 31:51.225
operation officer, S3. And I went to Houston for 
drills in. The old light guard division, that's

31:55.168 --> 31:59.532
what they called them, on the old Spanish Trail. 
And that's right, I was there. Then politics got

32:04.230 --> 32:06.012
involved. OK, tell me about that. Oh, yeah, they 
began to play politics. Who was they? The action

32:11.399 --> 32:16.445
general and division headquarters. They began to 
move men around and put them in command position

32:16.525 --> 32:22.092
who weren't really qualified. And

32:23.093 --> 32:28.540
then they began to, when there was election coming 
on, going to beat the drums for their candidate. So

32:31.511 --> 32:35.997
it kind of disenchanted me with the guard, and I 
said, no, I didn't want any part of that. So then

32:36.778 --> 32:39.802
that's when I transferred over to the Army 
Reserve. Now, before we do that, let's talk about

32:39.902 --> 32:44.208
Korea. Why did you feel that you should have been 
called up, or did you feel any, what did you think

32:45.009 --> 32:50.897
about Korea? Well, we were alerted, but we were 
never called up. I feel this way and feel strongly

32:56.864 --> 32:58.847
about it. if you're in a reserve unit, you're a 
trained person, and you should be called. Korea,

33:05.321 --> 33:08.243
Vietnam, didn't make any difference. We ought to 
have been called up to fight the war, because we

33:09.304 --> 33:17.472
were better trained than the draftee that they 
called us. That's just the point. That's the

33:18.833 --> 33:20.955
reason for the reserves, I thought. Yeah, I agree. 
And what bothers me, and it bothered me, even in the

33:22.317 --> 33:29.003
Vietnam, it bothered me more in the Vietnam area, 
because Here they would take a young man, no

33:29.152 --> 33:35.421
training at all, and send him for six months, and on 
the seventh month he was in combat. It's not fair.

33:36.943 --> 33:37.624
It's not right. Here we in World War II called up, go 
to basic training, go to advanced training, go to

33:38.025 --> 33:51.684
an active Army unit, and train for a year as a unit 
before they send you overseas. And here in Korea

33:52.866 --> 33:57.032
and in Vietnam they'd take a kid, 17, 18, 19 years 
old, six months, sent him to Fort Polk for six

33:57.518 --> 34:06.346
months training, and then seventh month, eighth 
month, he's in combat. Just not right. I don't

34:07.707 --> 34:08.328
believe it. I would never, and that six months 
training is good training. No question about it,

34:12.952 --> 34:16.615
but not for combat. I think that's the fallacy of 
the Vietnam conflict, that these poor kids over

34:17.796 --> 34:25.703
there didn't know what to do, and they had leaders 
who didn't know what to do. Of course, I read all of

34:26.594 --> 34:29.317
this, you know. And then talk to these people who 
come back. At the Command General Staff College,

34:32.260 --> 34:41.631
when I'd go up there and visit with them, and I could 
detect that some of the officers just didn't have

34:32.260 --> 34:41.631
the leadership. And so I'm a strong believer 
that... But you thought you should have gone in

34:45.935 --> 34:47.597
Korea. I really do. I think the 36th Division 
should have been called up and gone into Korea. Of

34:52.583 --> 34:56.567
course, we had two years, almost three years of of 
training. Now

34:59.055 --> 35:08.589
tell me how and why you switched to the Army Reserve 
and got out of the National Guard. And was this a big

35:09.190 --> 35:10.532
problem? Bureaucratically speaking was it a real 
pain to do that or was it an easy maneuver or how does

35:10.792 --> 35:16.901
this work? Well it wasn't a big pain to move except 
my superiors didn't want me to move. They wanted me

35:28.981 --> 35:32.865
to stay in the Guard, and I didn't want to stay in the 
Guard. Because of the politics? Because of the

35:34.687 --> 35:36.849
politics of getting involved. Now, could you give 
me a specific example of political pressure that

35:37.730 --> 35:41.834
you felt?

35:45.378 --> 35:47.540
I'm trying to remember who was the governor. They 
were trying to tell us that they wanted a certain

35:49.002 --> 35:55.409
man to, they wanted us to vote for him. And that kind 
of, it was all right to say we, You know, if they

35:58.900 --> 36:07.272
support a man, that's right, but not come around in 
a military armory meeting and suggest that we vote

35:58.900 --> 36:07.272
for this man. That wasn't as bad as it was when they 
started moving men, moving officers above other

36:09.135 --> 36:18.809
officers who weren't really qualified to be put in 
those positions. That's what really made me want

36:19.951 --> 36:26.460
to move out of the Guard. So you thought on a state 
level it was just not as professional and more

36:27.470 --> 36:41.851
politically, I wouldn't want to say corrupt, but 
more politically influenced than on a federal

36:27.470 --> 36:41.851
level with the Army Reserve. That's correct. 
Would you agree with that? I'd agree with that.

36:46.618 --> 36:50.724
There's politics in the Army Reserve, but not as 
prevalent as it is in the Guard. Okay. Yeah. More so

36:53.388 --> 36:57.173
in the officer corps. And the Guard is just riddled 
with politics. And I just couldn't. You found that

37:05.198 --> 37:06.460
distasteful. It was very distasteful. And it got 
worse as I found out later. And so I thought my move

37:11.028 --> 37:13.892
was just right. Moving from the Guard to the 
Reserve. And then the Reserve began to be active.

37:20.964 --> 37:22.286
They began to have more units. They began to have 
more support. Before that time it was all a control

37:24.423 --> 37:27.968
group type thing. And so then when they started 
having units in that's when I decided to join them

37:30.191 --> 37:36.661
and move. Okay now, was this 1956 then that you 
moved? 54. 54. And what was my, what's the date on

37:45.454 --> 37:48.338
there?

37:52.688 --> 37:58.816
Well, you became the commander, 17th Artillery, 
90th Infantry Division in 1956. Okay, in 54 I came

37:59.117 --> 38:01.860
into that same unit. No, I came over as the 
executive officer of a AAA battalion. Okay, so in

38:08.069 --> 38:09.831
56 then you moved. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Moved in 
54. I became a operation officer, S3. Wait a minute

38:18.783 --> 38:21.447
Terry, let me get my, without my notes or anything. 
I became the executive officer of an artillery

38:22.169 --> 38:27.938
battalion here in Beaumont. That isn't on here. 
It's not on there. No. No. At 4 1st Group, and I was

38:31.444 --> 38:36.753
there a year, and then the 90th Division took it 
over. I thought it was just a year, and I didn't...

38:37.694 --> 38:41.480
We were at Fort Sale. General Kidwell came down and 
told our battalion that the 90th Division was

38:41.961 --> 38:49.273
going to take us in as their... Artillery 
Battalion and it was going to be re-designated to

38:49.895 --> 38:57.242
the AAA, AAA Battalion. And so then the battalion 
commander then, John Stranahan, decided he

38:58.343 --> 39:05.129
wanted to get out. So he got out and General Kidwell 
asked me if I would command it. I was a major at the

39:09.232 --> 39:10.373
time. Okay, so then you became the commander of the 
17th Artillery. I became the commander of the 17th

39:14.797 --> 39:19.902
Artillery.

39:20.202 --> 39:24.606
And tell me, as far as that command was concerned, 
how many men did you have? How much artillery did

39:25.527 --> 39:27.048
you have? How much equipment? And the 7th is what is 
really known as the 5th of the 17th Artillery. But

39:33.834 --> 39:35.215
we call it the 17th Artillery. It's 17th Artillery 
Regiment. It's an old line regiment, an old army.

39:42.742 --> 39:46.926
We had a full complement of units, five units. We 
have the headquarter company, A battery, B

39:49.413 --> 39:53.420
battery, C battery, D battery. Full-firing 
batteries and headquarter company. Head and

39:57.606 --> 39:58.207
head. It was called head and head. And we had the 
largest strength of the battalions in the 90th in

40:00.671 --> 40:08.424
this area. We got up to about 410 or 15 people at one 
time. It was. It was. It was a great side. And it was

40:21.037 --> 40:24.100
over our maximum strength, what we did. Well, how 
could you do that? Well, we took the strength from,

40:25.261 --> 40:31.207
we took the quotas from the other battalions 
throughout the division. The division

40:31.567 --> 40:40.536
commander, General Rutter, told us that you just 
recruit as much as you want and we'll just take the

40:31.567 --> 40:40.536
spaces from the other units, which we did. And we, 
this area, just boomed with reservists. had units

40:45.809 --> 40:47.711
in Fort Arthur, Orange. Why do you think that is? 
Why do you think so many people were attracted in

40:49.714 --> 40:54.799
the mid-1950s to the reserves? We worked at it. We 
worked at it. Promoted it. Promoted it.

41:00.546 --> 41:01.507
Publicity-wise. Newspaper. Schools. Service 
clubs. I'd go to service clubs and make speeches

41:07.394 --> 41:10.738
all the time. Really? Oh, yeah. I was in the... I was 
president of the Kiwanis Club, and I was governor

41:12.961 --> 41:18.688
of Kiwanis, so I was very active in civic work. And 
the Lions Club would call me and ask me to come make a

41:19.388 --> 41:24.995
speech, and the Rotary would come and I'd go make a 
speech. And so we really beat the drum for the Army

41:25.035 --> 41:30.341
Reserve, and we got the people. Just people we knew 
and we didn't know would come and join us. I had a

41:35.767 --> 41:37.129
waiting list for the officers. Really? Waiting 
list. Just any time an officer had to move out of the

41:38.879 --> 41:45.928
unit or something, move out of the city, no problem 
replacing him. Just a waiting list. And I had a

41:47.950 --> 41:49.592
tremendous staff. Milton Bell, who eventually 
became my executive officer, was an architect. He

41:55.599 --> 41:58.342
owns his own firm now, A&M graduate. Jack B. 
Alexander was the S3, Major Alexander. Became the

42:01.826 --> 42:05.310
controller...

42:05.864 --> 42:09.728
of Guff Oil Corporation in Pittsburgh. Tommy 
LeBlanc was another one of my majors, and he now

42:09.748 --> 42:22.221
owns Guff Coast Supply on IH-10 out here, a 
multi-million dollar plant out there. They

42:22.241 --> 42:27.026
forage Christmas trees and stuff for the oil 
fields. Oh, I could just go on and on and tell you the

42:27.147 --> 42:33.774
people who've done well in civilian life. And they 
were all members of the unit. That's a very

42:35.463 --> 42:37.885
interesting point. Do you think that there is some 
correlation between officers and the local

42:38.065 --> 42:54.621
reserve units in the country, we could just make a 
general statement here, and successful

42:38.065 --> 42:54.621
community leaders? I would say yes. You bet. This 
is, at least it was in our area, where my brother

43:00.666 --> 43:04.710
Jimmy was a colonel who retired as a colonel of the 
reserve and was the mayor of Beaumont two terms.

43:11.260 --> 43:13.904
And so he was in the reserve. Why do you think that 
is? Well, I think it's the leadership that's in you

43:18.390 --> 43:26.761
and you just excel in this type of thing. And it gets 
back to that old A&M The training,

43:32.315 --> 43:34.117
self-discipline. You know, you wanted to take 
charge and do things. And we

43:38.924 --> 43:56.206
had the, let's see, I'm trying to think of some 
other, oh, well, the, well, another thing, the

43:38.924 --> 43:56.206
sheriff of our county was a retired, he came out of 
the army as a colonel, MP, and he, you know, people

43:38.924 --> 43:56.206
supported the reserve. And so, It wasn't 
something we were fighting. Everybody was trying

44:01.354 --> 44:02.476
to help us. Okay, now everybody's trying to help 
you. During the 1960s, of course, we had some

44:06.522 --> 44:21.846
anti-war protests and anti-military feeling in 
America after, by about 1970, when it appeared

44:06.522 --> 44:21.846
that we weren't really winning in Vietnam, 
although we had been told that it looked like the

44:22.147 --> 44:23.829
White was at the end of the tunnel. Did you get any 
anti-military or anti-reserve feeling during

44:24.110 --> 44:29.017
those years? Not really, Terry. We didn't get any 
anti-military

44:31.421 --> 44:37.470
response from the people. The feedback wasn't 
that way. Well, did you get any pro? We got, well,

44:42.357 --> 44:46.583
what we did get, we got a lot of support and reserve. 
Because a lot of people wanted to join. Join the

44:48.426 --> 44:49.547
reserve, yeah. They didn't want to, you know, be 
called up and go to Vietnam. So we had waiting lists

44:52.083 --> 45:02.438
then because it was a different reason than it was 
back when I had the artillery battalion. Yeah,

45:02.458 --> 45:06.504
artillery battalion.

45:09.088 --> 45:15.437
I think this is one of the things that helped me 
along the way that I learned at A&M. Okay. Was to

45:17.340 --> 45:20.605
select and... have around me people who were 
quality type people, who were smart and

45:21.648 --> 45:36.684
dedicated to help me do a job. I didn't select 
people to be on the staff because they were my

45:37.485 --> 45:42.130
friends. And I always guarded that. I helped my 
friends, no question about it. I'm a loyal type

45:49.518 --> 45:50.980
person. If you're my friend of mine, I'm very loyal 
to you. And I'll stick with you. And I'll do

45:57.023 --> 45:58.224
anything I can. But if you're a quality type friend 
and smart, intelligent, and you've got a lot on the

45:59.005 --> 46:13.778
ball, and you're my friend, I'm going to promote 
you and take care of you because you're helping me.

46:14.078 --> 46:14.719
Sure. Absolutely. And that was my, I guess it was my 
secret of why I went along the route of coming to

46:21.233 --> 46:24.937
general. I always surrounded myself with some 
good staff people, like the ones I named you a while

46:25.397 --> 46:30.922
ago. Bale, Alexander, Coffin, who owns all the 
cleaners in Beaumont now. He was my University of

46:36.468 --> 46:39.010
Texas graduate, I was telling you about. But he was 
my S4, my supply man. He got the job done, and he did

46:44.495 --> 46:46.777
it for me. He would tell me a lot of times, Colonel, 
We're not doing this right, and we're going to get

46:51.355 --> 46:54.944
in trouble. So I said, well, okay, Dick, what shall 
we do? He said, well, I think we ought to do this,

46:58.332 --> 47:00.217
this, this, this. All right.
