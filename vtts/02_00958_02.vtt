00:01.027 --> 00:17.524
I'm asking them because from

00:01.027 --> 00:17.524
your point of view, maybe a little bit different 
from somebody who actually fought or from one of

00:01.027 --> 00:17.524
the administrators or higher officials who 
actually implemented the war. In your opinion,

00:19.066 --> 00:28.536
why were we in

00:19.066 --> 00:28.536
Vietnam? I think we were there because of the 
perceived notion of the dominance theory. I think

00:35.396 --> 00:43.564
that policy at that time was we've got to stop the 
spread of communism. And we talked about

00:43.584 --> 00:47.207
supporting our democratic allies in Vietnam. I 
wasn't too impressed with our democratic allies

00:47.227 --> 00:51.791
in Vietnam. They were a sleazy bunch to tell you the 
truth. But it was a place where At that time, at any

00:57.119 --> 01:13.294
rate, the country thought, or the government 
thought, you know, if this goes down, it's going to

00:57.119 --> 01:13.294
be Cambodia, and then it's going to be Thailand, 
and then it's going to be Singapore, and then right

00:57.119 --> 01:13.294
down the line, I think that's what it would be. And 
do you think we were justified in being

01:13.315 --> 01:20.982
there? Yeah. And why do you think we lost? Because 
we didn't decide to kick their butts.

01:29.502 --> 01:31.385
We elected to fight their kind of war. They were 
superb guerrilla warriors. They really were. You

01:35.230 --> 01:37.994
can read the history of it if you didn't know it. And 
you can also read the history of the war. We'd gone

01:41.558 --> 01:48.328
north and taken care of them.

01:48.348 --> 01:53.154
And we would have been the villains in the eyes of 
the world for about six months. And everybody

01:53.595 --> 01:55.878
would have forgotten it. And everybody would have 
been home. There's been a terrible carnage among

01:58.477 --> 02:05.405
Vietnamese civilians, particularly in the, 
well, particularly in the north, but every place.

02:06.527 --> 02:12.053
They've taken a lot of American lives and 
shortened the war and would not have destroyed

02:06.527 --> 02:12.053
that country. And, you know, if we were going to go 
to war, we should have gone to war.

02:19.342 --> 02:21.785
And if we weren't going to war, we should have 
stayed home. Let the little brown devils fight

02:21.925 --> 02:23.387
themselves. You know, whatever they want to do is 
fine. You can't justify some of the things. I mean,

02:28.677 --> 02:30.419
how can you justify that? You can't justify 
killing some babies like that. But if you've been

02:33.902 --> 02:38.886
there, you can understand how it happened.

02:38.906 --> 02:54.100
Because, you know, if a cute little 
eight-year-old kid comes into your dining hall

02:38.906 --> 02:54.100
and puts the box down that's got 15, 20 pounds of TNT 
in it and kills all of you, The only person I ever

02:54.383 --> 03:05.021
know that shot at me, you know, I was in a lot of 
places where I got rockets and mortars and stuff

02:54.383 --> 03:05.021
like that, and they scared the hell out of me. But 
that was very impersonal. Nobody was trying to

03:06.343 --> 03:07.384
kill me. They were trying to shoot up the place 
where I was. But I was down in the Delta one time, and

03:10.770 --> 03:15.598
I flew into a... an army air base down there you 
imagine the air force couldn't get me a ride to an

03:15.747 --> 03:42.497
air base i had to ride with the army to an army base 
and then they came from the air force base to pick me

03:15.747 --> 03:42.497
up the jeep to take me up to the air force base and we 
were driving through this marshland and there was

03:15.747 --> 03:42.497
a pagoda buddhist i guess out in the middle of this 
field very interesting looking thing i called

03:15.747 --> 03:42.497
other american fighting men, the first thing I got 
when I went to war was a Japanese camera. And so I got

03:48.073 --> 03:55.219
the driver to stop so I could get a picture of the 
thing and put it on the telephoto lens so I could

03:48.073 --> 03:55.219
really see it good. And the first thing I saw was a 
kid, couldn't have been over 12, with a rifle

03:56.380 --> 04:03.647
pointed right back at my camera. And it bounced 
around with a round of ammunition off the front of

04:03.667 --> 04:09.432
that jeep. And I suggested to the sergeant, maybe 
we should go on. All the pictures I needed to be able

04:12.802 --> 04:15.866
to go to.

04:19.170 --> 04:21.533
But that was very personal. And I was a little kid.

04:26.999 --> 04:29.603
There's no way to justify that. But you can 
understand how it happened. Women and children

04:33.948 --> 04:35.790
got killed. Women and children were killing 
people. And the ones that got killed may not have

04:39.008 --> 04:50.422
been the ones that were killing people, but you can 
understand why he got

04:39.008 --> 04:50.422
paranoid about that. What, uh, what rank were you 
as a doctor? Major. Major.

04:58.552 --> 05:01.696
Uh, that's all the questions I have prepared. Is 
there anything you can think of that might be

05:01.796 --> 05:07.203
helpful to my study? Any experiences or anything 
you want? Check it out, I can't think of anything

05:09.873 --> 05:14.760
really. I think if I can find that booklet, I'll get 
it to you and I think there might be some of the stats

05:14.780 --> 05:24.333
that you asked about in there. And Jack Walker will 
be a good source for you. Jack was Peru military.

05:38.965 --> 05:57.904
He was also an internist, so some of the questions 
you asked about

05:38.965 --> 05:57.904
Vietnam-related diseases as opposed to 
injuries, I think I'm sure he could give you a lot

05:38.965 --> 05:57.904
better answers than I could.

05:57.924 --> 05:58.024
Okay. They've been very helpful. Well, I hope so. 
Yeah, it's gotten a lot of valuable information.

06:05.851 --> 06:06.492
And I will... They are communists.

06:24.887 --> 06:31.635
You are a

06:24.887 --> 06:31.635

06:35.783 --> 06:37.386

Rico.

10:42.941 --> 10:51.149
and 8. And B for numbers 1, 4, and 7.

11:01.025 --> 11:04.669
You will hear a brief conversation between two 
people said twice. You will probably not be able to

11:05.230 --> 11:08.754
understand every word in the conversation. 
Listen carefully for the main ideas and facts.

11:12.419 --> 11:15.722
Then read the series of either-or statements in 
your lab manual. Place a check mark by statement A

11:16.303 --> 11:22.130
or B that seems to best correspond to the 
conversation. Don't be afraid to guess the

11:22.711 --> 11:24.893
meaning of the cognates. Ahora escuche. Now

19:42.023 --> 19:46.363
But there is no easy way around it

Such

20:25.207 --> 20:36.059
a lonely, lonely,

20:25.207 --> 20:36.059
lonely world. People turn their heads and walk

20:36.079 --> 20:47.212
on by. Tell me, is it worth just another try? Light 
up the world. Shine on me. Love is the answer. Let it

20:53.399 --> 20:53.659
shine. Shine on us all. Set us free. Love is

21:01.471 --> 21:13.189
What are the

21:01.471 --> 21:13.189
chances? Ask the

21:15.112 --> 21:29.875
man in your heart for the answer And when you feel 
afraid

21:15.112 --> 21:29.875
When you've lost your way

21:37.060 --> 21:38.398
And when you're by

23:13.332 --> 23:23.186
And I was dreaming of the night Would it turn out 
right? How to tell

23:23.948 --> 23:36.606
you, girl I wanna build my world around

23:23.948 --> 23:36.606

yelled and screamed for more. And I wanted you. 
Night and day. Made us dance across the room. It

24:17.694 --> 24:18.135
ended all too soon.

24:30.923 --> 24:42.557
Don't

24:30.923 --> 24:42.557
be late. I cannot wait. I said to myself when we're 
old. We'll go dancing in the dark. Walking through

25:22.443 --> 25:39.152
The

25:22.443 --> 25:39.152
memories come alive.

25:52.936 --> 26:14.472
hurry don't be late i cannot wait i said to myself 
when we're old we'll go dancing in the dark walking

25:52.936 --> 26:14.472
through the park and reminiscing

27:25.850 --> 27:37.584
Packing up the dreams God planted

27:25.850 --> 27:37.584
in the firm soil of you.

27:41.148 --> 27:45.513
Can't believe the hopes he's granted.

27:48.076 --> 27:53.022
Means a chapter in your life is through. We'll keep 
you close as always.

28:02.913 --> 28:10.460

big and small ways

friend will not say never Cause the welcome will

To leave this place.
