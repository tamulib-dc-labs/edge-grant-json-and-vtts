WEBVTT

00:13.328 --> 00:19.577
The birth rate among middle-class Negroes is much 
less than it is among middle-class whites. So

00:22.260 --> 00:25.285
you're going back to Harvard, Dan, to continue 
this work in the fall? Right, and come back here

00:25.525 --> 00:29.971
again in the spring.

00:30.432 --> 00:35.539
After your 66th birthday, you have to retire from 
administrative jobs at Harvard.

00:43.079 --> 00:49.688
You could continue to teach on a half-time basis 
for four years until you're 70. I'm 67 now.

00:54.835 --> 00:59.521
You were explaining why you were only going to 
teach half-time? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:03.586 --> 01:10.015
So I'm teaching there in the fall semester and here 
at UCSD in the spring.

01:13.049 --> 01:18.824
When you come back to UCSD, what sort of courses do 
you offer?

01:18.844 --> 01:26.925
Well, my new professorship is professor of 
science and public policy, the kind of

01:18.844 --> 01:26.925
professorship that old professors have. I don't 
know much science anymore.

01:32.287 --> 01:44.541
And the course I taught, I taught an undergraduate 
course this spring called Technology in the Poor

01:32.287 --> 01:44.541
Countries, which I talked about.

01:44.561 --> 01:55.353
And in Harvard, I teach a course, undergraduate 
course, called Human Population to Natural

01:44.561 --> 01:55.353
Resources. And I have a group of graduate students 
who are getting their doctorate degrees. And I

02:00.282 --> 02:09.153
take part in three or four other courses and 
population courses that are given under the

02:00.282 --> 02:09.153
auspices of the Center for Population Studies. 
But the only course I'm solely responsible for is

02:09.173 --> 02:18.043
this big undergraduate

02:09.173 --> 02:18.043
course. Now, I now have a series of questions and 
comments I'd like for you to make up on various

02:18.083 --> 02:26.413
things that you've done or things you've said in 
your career. First, the Capricorn expedition.

02:30.944 --> 02:38.672
Well, was the major purpose of the Capricorn 
expedition to measure heat loss? Heat flow, you

02:39.553 --> 02:40.394
mean? Heat flow, right. No. Like all these, like 
most of these big expeditions, it was to,

02:43.797 --> 02:59.533
it was, it had several purposes, but the principal 
purpose was the geology and geophysics of the of

03:00.037 --> 03:03.202
the deep sea floor of the Pacific. And we studied 
that basically in four or five different ways. One

03:12.577 --> 03:17.084
was by the main concern. That was the seismic 
refraction studies, which which basically gave

03:24.421 --> 03:34.430
the depth of sediments, the depth of what's called 
the second layer, and the depth to the Mohorovic

03:24.421 --> 03:34.430
discontinuity.

03:36.752 --> 03:38.593
And some idea about the sound velocity. In fact, a 
good idea about the sound velocity in these

03:38.613 --> 03:42.337
different layers.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.323
The second was deep sea sounding. And Bill Menard 
and Bob Fisher were in charge of it. that part of the

03:54.779 --> 03:56.001
operation.

03:59.806 --> 04:07.336
We were particularly interested here in the Tonga 
Trench, which is one of the great deeps, oceanic

03:59.806 --> 04:07.336
deeps of the world. It may even be the deepest, 
although there are four deeps that are just about

04:07.377 --> 04:19.273
the same depth, the Mindanao Trench, the Marianas 
Trench, the Tonga Trench, and the Kuril Trench.

04:19.293 --> 04:22.137
And we wanted to find out what its shape was, what it 
actually looked like. Because Bob Fisher

04:27.177 --> 04:42.372
particularly had developed a hypothesis that new 
trenches would be V-shaped in cross-section,

04:27.177 --> 04:42.372
have practically no sediments in them, whereas 
old trenches would have a flat bottom. The U-shape

04:42.432 --> 04:43.714
would be U-shaped. Not necessarily old trenches, 
but trenches that had A very considerable

04:48.661 --> 04:54.588
sediment source nearby would have a flat bottom, 
and the sediments would accumulate in them. And of

04:56.110 --> 05:02.397
course, it turned out that the Tonga Trench was 
B-shaped, flat B. And the other part of the job of

05:03.738 --> 05:11.768
studying the trench was, what were the sediments 
like? And what sediments there were were

05:11.788 --> 05:18.195
practically all volcanic there. And this was, as 
you might expect, because only

05:20.335 --> 05:29.249
the very youngest sediments were still there. The 
others were being carried down into the crust of

05:29.269 --> 05:35.739
the Earth.

05:35.759 --> 05:47.457
And the problem of how deep it was and how variable 
the depth was, one of the interesting discoveries

05:35.759 --> 05:47.457
was a great seamount on the side of it. of the 
trench, of the volcano that had been carried down

05:47.960 --> 05:51.565
into the trench. It was already several hundred 
meters deep.

05:58.333 --> 06:15.655
We were interested in one of the other interesting 
things we did was to look at a place called Alexa

05:58.333 --> 06:15.655
Bank, which is north of the Fiji Islands, between 
the Fiji Islands and the Marianas Islands, or the

05:58.333 --> 06:15.655
Marshall Islands, which was a sunken atoll. An 
atoll that never recovered after the

06:16.613 --> 06:18.996
Pleistocene. The top of it is about 100, 200 people 
over the surface. And we had divers, scuba divers,

06:24.664 --> 06:29.471
who went down and looked at this. It's just a 
typical atoll, but one which was never able to

06:29.491 --> 06:36.661
build up as fast as the water rose. And the result 
was that it's now a fossil atoll. So another thing

06:41.268 --> 06:46.215
that we were interested in was the bottom, was the 
topography of what was called what is now called

06:46.853 --> 07:12.979
the Easter Island Rise, the mid-ocean ridge in the 
South Pacific, which continues all the way into

06:46.853 --> 07:12.979
the Gulf of California, and California itself is 
really part of the Easter Island Rise, separated

06:46.853 --> 07:12.979
with what we now call the Pacific Plate from the 
American Plate, the North American Plate.

07:14.545 --> 07:16.968
Another thing was, of course, the measurement of 
the heat flow. We'd already measured that on the

07:17.889 --> 07:27.102
mid-pack exposition in the area between the 
Marshall Islands and the Hawaiian Islands. We got

07:27.122 --> 07:30.526
a lot more measurements on Capricorn. And 
another, Ronald Mason was on board. And his

07:34.151 --> 07:42.983
interest was in making magnetic surveys, 
essentially towing the magnetometer and then

07:43.570 --> 07:47.636
making magnetic surveys around some of the South 
Pacific atolls. We were also very much interested

07:49.599 --> 07:51.922
in the sediments that we had. We took a lot of long 
quarters. And we had a new tool, a new toy, if you

07:55.287 --> 07:57.631
will. We had a huge winch that was capable of 
getting to the bottom of the Tawny Trench.

08:06.584 --> 08:09.628
This winch didn't work very well. It was like a 
fishing wheel that overruns. It would get out of

08:13.669 --> 08:20.899
control, and then the wire would get snarled, 
badly snarled.

08:20.919 --> 08:31.635
And this happened to us before we went to Fiji, and 
we spent quite a bit of time in Fiji getting the wire

08:20.919 --> 08:31.635
spliced and the winch refitted. It happened again 
to us in the Tonga Trench, and we had about 30,000

08:33.097 --> 08:39.666
feet of cable over the side. It's a tapered cable, 
small at the outer end, big at the inner end.

08:47.483 --> 08:50.165
Because otherwise, the cable wouldn't hold its 
own weight in those great depths. And this was one

08:52.026 --> 08:55.349
of the worst days I ever spent in my life. The wire 
got badly kinked. And so what we had to do was to cut

09:00.353 --> 09:08.861
it and remove the kinked portion and then splice it 
together again. And we had about, I don't know, six

09:08.881 --> 09:11.863
or seven tons weight hanging over the ship and the 
A-frame and the stern of the ship. This was on the

09:18.991 --> 09:20.013
Horizon. Horizon was the one that had the big wind. 
Not the Horizon, I'm sorry, Spencer F. Baird.

09:26.441 --> 09:33.711
Horizon was the two-ship expedition, Horizon and 
Spencer F. Baird.

09:33.731 --> 09:36.635
It took 24 hours to do this. And at all the time, you 
were afraid something was going to slip. and put

09:42.640 --> 10:00.887
wire clamps on the bitter end, the outer end of the 
cable, and have enough

09:42.640 --> 10:00.887
room at the back of this clamp so that you could 
splice it, so you could make a long splice. Very

10:02.390 --> 10:06.696
painful, difficult process with three-quarters 
cable. But anyhow, he did it and brought it out. And

10:12.897 --> 10:16.041
we used the wedge after that quite successfully. 
That was the last time that the goddamn thing fell.

10:21.086 --> 10:21.847
Gosh, what an awful.

10:27.533 --> 10:38.706
It would have been, we gradually learned in the 
oceanographic business to handle heavier and

10:27.533 --> 10:38.706
heavier weights, more and more massive 
equipment. And that's, of course, the ultimate

10:43.475 --> 10:56.772
The result of this is this huge Glomar Challenger, 
which stores 100 tons

10:43.475 --> 10:56.772
of pipe in the bottom. So the sediments, the heat 
flow, the bottom topography, the magnetic

10:56.792 --> 11:10.849
measurements,

10:56.792 --> 11:10.849
looking at shallow water features like Falcon 
Bank, which volcano that gets cleaned off. In a few

11:16.220 --> 11:23.108
years, every time it erupts, and it creates a pile 
of volcanic debris several hundred feet high.

11:23.228 --> 11:24.269
It's an island. It then gets washed away by the 
waves. And in between eruptions, it's about 50

11:26.011 --> 11:36.444
feet deep, or at least 25 feet deep. I remember we 
were very touchy about going on approaching

11:41.508 --> 11:44.332
Stalkin Island, and we were afraid we might go and 
drown. I

11:46.636 --> 12:01.357
remember Art Maxwell coming up to me and saying, 
we're aground.

12:04.061 --> 12:11.312
And what had happened was we backed up, and we were 
getting the bubbles from our own weight.

12:13.317 --> 12:15.440
morning ground, thank God.

12:18.323 --> 12:27.936
We did a lot of work in the islands, like in the 
Beattie Islands, a lot of topography in shallow

12:18.323 --> 12:27.936
water.

12:33.382 --> 12:42.514
We started out from Bikini, or from Quagmire, from 
Bikini, actually, where both ships had been

12:33.382 --> 12:42.514
involved in one of the one of the big hydrogen bomb 
tests.

12:49.689 --> 13:08.350
And then went from there to the Fiji Islands, and 
the Fijis to the Tonga Islands, and the Tongas to

12:49.689 --> 13:08.350
Tahiti, and Tahiti to the Tuamotus, and from the 
Tuamotus to the Marquesas, and then home across

12:49.689 --> 13:08.350
the eastern North Pacific. All together lasted 
about four months. I remember we spent Christmas

13:11.762 --> 13:15.046
in the Tonga Islands.

13:18.992 --> 13:21.095
And we had many subsidiary projects. For example, 
one of the most interesting things about high

13:21.115 --> 13:32.691
islands in the Pacific, like some of the Tonga 
Islands, is that there's a notch cut just in the

13:21.115 --> 13:32.691
tidal zone. These are limestone islands. And you 
get erosion of the limestone in the intertidal

13:34.874 --> 13:37.678
zone. The profile of the island would be a cliff 
like this, cut back like this, and then a reef out

13:38.468 --> 13:43.893
here. And what in the world causes that? Nobody 
really knows what causes it. Because the ocean is

13:50.140 --> 13:55.926
super saturated, the surface ocean water is super 
saturated with calcium carbonate. But

13:56.026 --> 14:07.277
apparently in the intertidal zone, you have 
sufficient biological activity so that the pH is

13:56.026 --> 14:07.277
lowered part of the time. by organic production of 
CO2 and organic production of organic acids,

14:08.776 --> 14:18.649
which allows the calcium carbonate to dissolve.

14:24.056 --> 14:25.638
Walter Monk was on the expedition. Bill

14:25.678 --> 14:34.850
Menard, Bill Riedel, Bob Fisher, Russ Ray, Helen 
Ray was on it. She joined us in Tonga and went the

14:35.551 --> 14:38.074
rest of the way with us. We had most of the best top 
Iranians. I think was on board, too. I'm sure

14:47.274 --> 14:51.458
he was. We had most of the geologists and 
geophysicists of the Scripps Institution on this

14:51.478 --> 14:58.526
expedition.

15:03.010 --> 15:07.555
And it was a, we didn't really learn

15:10.960 --> 15:18.607
as much from that expedition as we did from 
mid-pack, which was the first one of our

15:10.960 --> 15:18.607
expeditions. But it was there that the rust rays 
definitely showed that the sediments were very

15:18.627 --> 15:26.414
thin, and our heat flow measurements showed that 
the heat flow was very high. But

15:26.534 --> 15:37.164
we learned a lot about the trench, and that was 
perhaps the most important thing. We did a bit of

15:37.184 --> 15:40.647
work on the trenches off the American coast. the 
Acapulco Trench and the Peru-Chile Trench.

15:46.595 --> 15:53.484
And we learned a good deal about the South Pacific 
deep sea sediments.

15:59.252 --> 16:05.740
And gradually, over the years, we had a series of 
expeditions like this. Capricorn was the only two

16:06.344 --> 16:18.041
that I led, but we had a lot of others led by the other 
people that I described yesterday. And I think we

16:18.061 --> 16:32.102
contributed very fundamentally to the

16:18.061 --> 16:32.102
ideas of sea floor spreading and plate tectonics. 
I guess the most significant thing that we did as it

16:35.622 --> 16:43.030
turned out, was the work that Ronald Mason did 
right off the California coast. He wanted to make a

16:44.932 --> 16:54.502
magnetic, using this towed magnetometer that 
Victor Wacky invented during World War II, he

16:44.932 --> 16:54.502
wanted to make a magnetic survey. The coast 
geodetic survey was at that time making a

16:55.383 --> 17:04.633
topographic survey of the sea floor up to 200 or 300 
miles off California. Ron thought it would be a

17:05.204 --> 17:14.655
good idea to make a magnetic survey at the same time 
as this topographic survey is being made. And I

17:14.675 --> 17:17.679
thought it would too, although I didn't quite know 
why. But it was a new geophysical tool that was

17:19.481 --> 17:22.725
bound to show something. And what he found when he 
worked up the data was that the remnant magnetism

17:24.907 --> 17:33.878
had a very Well, it had a remarkable pattern. It had 
a pattern of long stripes of high and low magnetic

17:37.114 --> 18:03.443
field, of ridges, magnetic ridges that would be 
100 miles long or so, 150 miles long, and then

17:37.114 --> 18:03.443
separated by magnetic look, by magnetic valleys, 
if you will, ridge and valley structure and

17:37.114 --> 18:03.443
contiguous series of these things. These were cut 
by what Bill Menard called fracture zones.

18:13.782 --> 18:18.787
And they didn't continue across the fracture 
zones. Later, Victor Boffier and Arthur Roth

18:18.807 --> 18:21.930
continued this work. And they showed that, in 
fact, the whole pattern of Richardson Cross was

18:21.951 --> 18:31.340
displaced on the two sides of a fracture zone by 
distances up to several hundred kilometers. It

18:32.861 --> 18:33.582
wasn't a lot. Well, that was really the real

18:34.591 --> 18:50.831
confirmation of the ideas of movement of plates of 
the sea floor.

18:50.851 --> 19:00.362
And it was later that people in England got the idea 
that these magnetic stripes were alternately

19:02.840 --> 19:11.408
dikes of volcanic rock that were coming up along 
the mid-ocean ridges and moving across the ocean

19:02.840 --> 19:11.408
floor to the edges of the plates. That's the notion 
of sea floor spreading, which is one of the basic

19:12.289 --> 19:19.756
concepts of plate tectonics. The ocean floor was 
continually being renewed along the mid-ocean

19:19.776 --> 19:30.546
ridge and continually moving toward the edges of 
the ocean basin. Bob Fisher and I wrote a paper.

19:32.894 --> 19:45.509
which we call the trenches of the Pacific, about 
1954, I guess, in which we analyzed the remarkable

19:32.894 --> 19:45.509
features of the trenches. And it

19:46.690 --> 19:57.282
seemed quite clear to us that there must be 
downward movement under the trenches. And that's

19:57.302 --> 19:58.624
what we said, in fact. And the reason was that they 
had no sediment in them. They had negative gravity

20:01.263 --> 20:03.085
anomalies. They had very low heat flow.

20:09.813 --> 20:21.946
And this

20:09.813 --> 20:21.946
meant that if you had a downward force acting 
downward to pull the rock down and to cool it off,

20:09.813 --> 20:21.946
pull the heat down. Whereas in the mid-ocean 
ridge, there was an upward moving arm of a

20:28.413 --> 20:32.858
convection cell, believe it or not, you had a high 
heat flow over the ridges. And that was what Martin

20:32.878 --> 20:39.306
Maxwell had found on a later expedition to the 
eastern South Pacific. Over the Easter Island

20:39.867 --> 20:49.999
rise, there was high heat flow intermediate 
between the ridge and the trench and very low heat

20:39.867 --> 20:49.999
flow over the trench or near the trench.

20:52.730 --> 21:15.360
And then we wrote a paper, Maxwell and Bullard and I 
wrote a paper on the measurements of heat cells, in

20:52.730 --> 21:15.360
which we said we couldn't explain these in any 
other way than by huge convection cells in the

20:52.730 --> 21:15.360
mantle rising along the ridges and sinking along 
the trenches, and that the rock was being carried

20:52.730 --> 21:15.360
along the sea floor from the ridge to the trench. We 
didn't have the wit to...

21:22.852 --> 21:49.112
make the connection between this process and this 
magnetic striking, which in fact occurs all over

21:22.852 --> 21:49.112
the ocean, all over the deep sea, which is the 
clearest evidence there is of that movement of the

21:22.852 --> 21:49.112
bottom of the ocean floor away from the ridges and 
toward the trenches, or toward the continental

21:22.852 --> 21:49.112
boundary. This, of course, also explains why 
there's so little sediment. It had previously

21:53.716 --> 22:05.456
been thought that there must be thousands of feet 
of sediment, of the deep sea sediments, which had

21:53.716 --> 22:05.456
been accumulating since the beginning of 
geologic time. It turned out there were only about

22:06.498 --> 22:11.226
100 meters of sediment in much of the sea floor. And 
nobody could possibly figure out say that this had

22:14.759 --> 22:17.482
been accumulated since the beginning of 
geological time. It just wasn't anywhere near

22:17.502 --> 22:18.944
enough of it. Something must have been getting our 
set of them. What was getting them was that they

22:21.928 --> 22:27.594
were moving away into the trenches and being 
carried down into the interior of the Earth. And

22:30.117 --> 22:37.486
nobody has ever found anything on the ocean floor 
older than about mid-potation, about 150 million

22:30.117 --> 22:37.486
years old. Our mid-pack expedition, we found on 
the tops of these deep, 6,000-foot seamounts of

22:43.447 --> 22:50.457
shallow water fossils, which were about 100 
million years old, late Cretaceous. That was

22:52.380 --> 22:57.588
another indication that the ocean floor was very 
young. All these phenomena had occurred just in

22:58.469 --> 23:07.782
the last really few minutes of geologic time.

23:08.343 --> 23:12.289
I've thought for a while that maybe the 
explanation for the deep seamounts was that the

23:12.893 --> 23:19.382
volume of the ocean had increased a lot in the last 
100 million years. But I think Bill Menard gave the

23:20.364 --> 23:36.927
true explanation, and that was that the seamounts 
formed on the ridges, the volcanoes on the ridge,

23:20.364 --> 23:36.927
and then moved down the slope from the ridge to the 
deep sea. And they just gradually got deeper and

23:37.027 --> 23:41.854
deeper as they went further from the ridge. When 
you say increase in the volume of the ocean, is that

23:42.003 --> 23:48.250
when you suggest that the Pacific seabed dropped 
drastically 100 million years ago? Or sometimes.

23:51.374 --> 23:51.874
Sometimes. Not 100 million years. Within the last 
100 million years. I don't think that that's

23:56.560 --> 24:04.829
certainly not a, probably not a correct 
explanation, and certainly not a necessary

23:56.560 --> 24:04.829
explanation. I think it's more likely that what 
happened is that the volcano simply moved into

24:04.849 --> 24:09.975
deeper water. They were in shallow water. Their 
tops were at the surface, planed off at the

24:11.787 --> 24:18.635
surface, and moved into water that was about 6,000 
feet deeper. And their tops are therefore now

24:19.697 --> 24:25.344
6,000 feet deep.

24:25.364 --> 24:31.131
But they're planed off, retaining the shallow 
water character. And the atolls formed the same

24:31.151 --> 24:32.853
way. The only difference being the atolls moved 
slowly enough so that coral reef animals could

24:32.873 --> 24:40.022
keep up with the sinking. Whereas these deep sea 
mounds, these gills, apparently moved too fast

24:41.015 --> 24:53.491
before the corals could get started or could 
really maintain themselves.

24:57.276 --> 25:10.954
We have

24:57.276 --> 25:10.954
a remarkable collection of people who were 
working on these different aspects of the geology

24:57.276 --> 25:10.954
and geophysics. Russ Rade and George Shore, Art 
Maxwell and Dick Von Herzen, Art Roth, Ronald

25:12.149 --> 25:32.600
Mason, Victor Bacchier,

25:12.149 --> 25:32.600
Gustav Arrhenius, Ed Goldberg, Henry Roche, and 
later, Pam Craig and Hans Seuss.

25:39.791 --> 25:40.452
And then the And that's why I say it was one of the 
great ages of exploration, because this is when we

25:42.878 --> 25:57.535
really found that the ocean floor is quite 
different in many ways than the continents are,

25:42.878 --> 25:57.535
very fundamentally different than the 
continents. It's quite obvious now with this idea

25:58.376 --> 26:11.552
of sea floor spreading and that

25:58.376 --> 26:11.552
on the sea floor you have half a dozen features that 
are unique. One of them is the seamounts and the

26:15.032 --> 26:18.275
atolls. Another is the trenches. Another is the 
mid-ocean ridges. So another is what are called

26:23.261 --> 26:30.248
abyssal plains, absolutely flat plains that 
extend for hundreds of miles. These were first

26:30.929 --> 26:39.278
discovered by Morris Ewing in Atlanta, but they 
exist also in the Pacific.

26:40.557 --> 26:54.814
These are due to huge masses of sediment being 
carried down by density currents from the

26:40.557 --> 26:54.814
continental slope and spreading in something 
like a base surge of Bikini over a very wide area and

26:40.557 --> 26:54.814
then settling down. Still another, which was Bill 
Menard's major discovery, was the fraction

26:55.895 --> 27:03.865
zones, which we now know cut across the the 
mid-ocean ridges and displaced them. The

27:07.419 --> 27:20.396
mid-ocean ridges are displaced about every 100 or 
200 miles by a fracture zone,

27:07.419 --> 27:20.396
which was explained by Tuzo Wilson. These are 
trans-current faults. The problem is what

27:27.064 --> 27:32.451
happens at the end of these things, at the end of 
them. You have to have sinking or rising of

27:32.785 --> 27:36.069
material. And so they extend all the way to the 
place where sinking is occurring, the trenches,

27:36.910 --> 27:46.742
in other words. And the whole series, there are a 
whole lot of them here in the Pacific. Then they

27:49.746 --> 27:51.788
were later discovered in the Atlantic, too. The 
difference in the discoveries and who made the

27:52.790 --> 28:01.240
discoveries was basically what ocean people were 
working on in the Atlantic, the mid-ocean ridge.

28:02.063 --> 28:10.134
was a much more clear-cut feature and had this 
crack down the middle of it, a whole series of

28:02.063 --> 28:10.134
cracks, which were places where the lava was 
rising. In the Pacific, the Easter Island rise is

28:11.075 --> 28:16.783
the same kind of a feature, but a much gentler 
feature. It didn't exhibit its mid-ridge crack.

28:21.349 --> 28:26.917
On the other hand, the fracture zones were much 
more clearly present and easily seen in the

28:21.349 --> 28:26.917
Pacific. And the trenches are almost not quite, 
but almost entirely of the city, ocean phenomena.

28:38.820 --> 28:52.154
And these were the basic building blocks of the 
theory of seafloor spreading and the theory of

28:38.820 --> 28:52.154
plate tectonics. And I guess

28:52.174 --> 28:59.982
I think the credit for the actual Putting things 
together, the synthesis belongs to a series of

29:00.788 --> 29:06.297
people, a group of people, none of whom are in 
scripts. Bob Dietz, who was here as a graduate,

29:07.218 --> 29:22.502
took his PhD here, but later worked with Noah, and 
Harry Hess at Princeton, and a couple of guys at

29:07.218 --> 29:22.502
Cambridge, England.

29:22.843 --> 29:24.065
Matthews and Drummond. So Drummond, Matthews, 
and the name of the other one.

29:33.577 --> 29:38.045
I don't remember who they were, but Matthew was one 
of them. Neither Ewing, who did a tremendous

29:38.065 --> 29:51.609
amount of actual data gathering in the sea, nor we, 
really had the imagination to put it all together,

29:38.065 --> 29:51.609
as we did. Seaboard spreaders and plate tectonics 
people did.
