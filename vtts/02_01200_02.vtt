WEBVTT

00:01.955 --> 00:21.620
But I remember we were scrambling for books 
publishing some things that we wouldn't

00:01.955 --> 00:21.620
otherwise

00:01.955 --> 00:21.620
publish.

00:27.107 --> 00:29.110
Let me ask one question. We

00:30.052 --> 00:54.881
published Times Distractions, which was a play in 
the time of Philip II, Charles II, by one of our

00:30.052 --> 00:54.881
English department faculty members. And it's the 
last book that anybody would be expecting to see in

00:54.901 --> 00:58.405
the Texas A&M University Press, but we needed it to 
fill out our list of things that she wanted us to

00:54.901 --> 00:58.405
publish. And there were a couple of others like 
that. Little far afield from what Frank wanted the

01:04.339 --> 01:09.827
press to focus on. And didn't fit in any of the 
series.

01:13.914 --> 01:24.750
And his focus was to publish in those series and 
keep those revolving films active. And not

01:25.731 --> 01:28.155
publish much outside of those series. Those

01:29.249 --> 01:53.452
deals carried the most of the capital of the public 
interest. He had told me when I came here, when I was

01:53.472 --> 01:56.495
interviewed, I think it was in June at my first 
meeting, he told me that he wanted to keep the press

01:53.472 --> 01:56.495
small. He wanted to keep it at about the same 
publishing range as it started 15 or 16 days ago.

02:00.097 --> 02:08.689
and I know that you wanted to publish in

02:00.097 --> 02:08.689
those series. Well, let me stop right here and ask 
something about the series. From your own

02:11.734 --> 02:26.995
perspective, over time, years ago, have those 
series been a truly effective vehicle for press

02:11.734 --> 02:26.995
development? Or have they been complying with 
you? Well,

02:29.712 --> 02:51.792
they have

02:29.712 --> 02:51.792
been combining to some extent. I would say that 
they really are an asset to have those kinds of

02:51.812 --> 02:53.433
funds available. Some of those funds are really 
for our revenue. We've obviously made good

02:54.414 --> 02:56.576
publishing decisions and those that return a lot 
more to the funds than they cost. So we're really in

02:56.596 --> 02:57.897
a good position now to do a lot of publishing. But

02:58.720 --> 03:17.421
the drawback is that those revolving funds are not 
like subsidies. The

03:17.924 --> 03:32.538
money has to go back

03:17.924 --> 03:32.538
into the funds to keep them in the office so that we 
can publish more books. So we still have to make

03:32.559 --> 03:33.320
good choices. We can't just publish anything that 
comes in. Which is, that's a good point. That's a

03:34.884 --> 03:35.325
good history. But, um, so

03:35.558 --> 03:53.681
we treat

03:35.558 --> 03:53.681
those funds as

03:35.558 --> 03:53.681
short-term loans. We look at it that way, and the 
funds will . Now, the restricting part is that the

03:58.167 --> 04:00.210
funds won't cover certain areas of publication. 
The Moody series covers natural history funds,

04:00.230 --> 04:02.072
the Moore series covers art books, and so on. And

04:04.820 --> 04:30.585
so, when we come along with a series on the 
environmental history cities that we've

04:04.820 --> 04:30.585
accomplished, and it's not funded, we have to 
treat those things as most universities and

04:04.820 --> 04:30.585
places have to do all of the enhancements. We have 
to be very cost-conscious and be very economical

04:30.605 --> 04:33.427
about how we fund those things and the returns that 
we can expect from those things. And we're very

04:33.447 --> 04:34.168
realistic about that. because

04:35.228 --> 04:54.094
we don't have that short-term loan at this point in 
the cash flow. And we spend a lot of money on those

04:54.114 --> 04:56.237
that are not financed from new funds in a 
particular season. And we don't get returns on

04:56.257 --> 04:57.799
those goods when we're not running the cash flow. 
And that probably is more than what I'm doing with

04:57.819 --> 04:59.481
the press, but even on business. And we have, over 
the years, we have run into problems, serious

04:59.714 --> 05:15.757
problems of how we're going to pay for the next 
season's list before we start making money on it.

05:15.917 --> 05:23.207
And the problem is we've got a plan for two years and 
a half on it. Mm-hm, mm-hm. I mean, How do you feel

05:25.482 --> 05:48.604
that the A&M Press interacted with, or 
interrelated with, or received by the Texas

05:25.482 --> 05:48.604
A&M University faculty? The

05:49.343 --> 06:12.406
faculty that I worked with in those early days, the 
faculty members were mostly authors. They were

06:12.426 --> 06:13.747
authors for a long time, whose books I was working 
with. And they were all very enthusiastic about

06:13.767 --> 06:14.668
it. As I said, people whose books we wouldn't 
normally have published, that

06:16.242 --> 06:24.415
we did publish because we needed to build our list. 
And those are also books that might have had some

06:24.435 --> 06:27.045
difficulty finding a publisher elsewhere. One 
reason I still come under what the relationship of

06:27.920 --> 06:39.421
repressed is to a faculty member is really hard to 
define. It is, and it varies a lot. It varies a lot,

06:41.365 --> 06:48.358
and I'm not sure that the faculty really are fully 
aware or fully appreciative of repressed. Well,

06:49.115 --> 07:10.837
it's always been the case, and I'm sure you will. 
The other presses were awkward, both at home in

07:10.857 --> 07:12.939
Illinois and other presses whose editors they 
talked to. But a lot of professors feel that to step

07:15.035 --> 07:36.721
down and publish with

07:15.035 --> 07:36.721
their own university news press because that is an 
easy way to get your book published. Although,

07:36.741 --> 07:38.303
generally, the opposite is the case. We try to get 
reviews from outside the university when we are

07:38.483 --> 07:41.987
judging. in

07:41.967 --> 07:55.041
particular faculty members for food. And so we'll 
try to find critical reviews from outside the

07:55.061 --> 07:57.968
university, and those people will be more 
judgmental than some of the faculty members. I

08:00.395 --> 08:14.504
mean, I also thought that maybe the faculty 
advisory committee had as

08:00.395 --> 08:14.504
much value in communicating the mission and 
activities of the faculty as it does in providing a

08:00.395 --> 08:14.504
human view. Well, I think the faculty committee 
here, I think it's important to point that out.

08:19.852 --> 08:30.582
Frank set up this

08:19.852 --> 08:30.582
committee in kind of reaction to the way that this 
committee had worked at the University of Texas.

08:30.602 --> 08:32.944
That's why I picked up on that. That's important. 
And having a group, a large group, in which

08:33.324 --> 08:48.878
interested members can be selected and have

08:33.324 --> 08:48.878
a particular meeting is the way he set it up from the 
start. And he did that so that he could get people

08:50.395 --> 09:00.963
who were really interested in

08:50.395 --> 09:00.963
what they could contribute to a particular area. 
I'm going to try to do a good thing with the Academy

09:00.983 --> 09:06.818
Advisory Committee and then later with the 
Advisory Council. Right. I

09:11.328 --> 09:22.821
think Frank was involved in starting that up. 
Yeah. In fact, I'm wondering, would that Frank,

09:23.241 --> 09:31.791
again, set these things up? Because he was doing 
this already, but we had the institutional ones. I

09:36.903 --> 09:54.962
mean,

09:36.903 --> 09:54.962
in fact, that first letter you wrote in September 
of the third, you know, I gave him this

09:36.903 --> 09:54.962
conservative

09:36.903 --> 09:54.962
applause. Okay, let's kind of summarize this 
stuff. So, those early years, really great

09:58.746 --> 10:03.231
sensations, I think the most

10:03.633 --> 10:28.948
important

10:03.633 --> 10:28.948
thought about it is that Frank,

10:30.177 --> 10:47.677
given his tremendous experience in business, 
knew exactly what he wanted to do with the press. He

10:47.697 --> 10:48.138
set it up that way. He got the cooperation with the 
administration, with all the students, and with

10:48.158 --> 10:50.040
everyone else. He set it up. And of course, they 
respected his opinion. And so there really was His

10:52.165 --> 11:08.171
idea of wave pressure,

10:52.165 --> 11:08.171
he said, is real. This man obviously knows what 
he's talking about. Yeah, in several areas, you

11:09.192 --> 11:12.438
know, you start with the water, you go into the 
water, you park wires. However, one more way,

11:12.458 --> 11:13.279
that's what we do. And

11:13.698 --> 11:19.106
so he set it up. He wanted it to be a full-blown press 
from the start. And it was small. Our first

11:27.417 --> 11:40.235
season, we published eight books. And we 
continued that for the next five years. Five or six

11:41.196 --> 11:41.557
years. And... That was his intention. He went

11:45.326 --> 11:55.297
into it without any chance, and he carried it out. 
Were you surprised at him when he got ready to

11:55.377 --> 12:00.683
announce his retirement, or this was all part of 
the... No, we knew. He told me in our interview that

12:00.703 --> 12:05.608
he was going to retire in a few years. We hated to see 
it happen. He had asked me to stay at the Press in his

12:10.483 --> 12:19.818
mind, and I promised him that I would. So that was 
1980. So he had retired before my commitment to the

12:21.841 --> 12:30.995
Press was really over. Now, who comes in at Don 
Collins' times? About the same time you were

12:34.833 --> 12:36.876
there? No, Don started earlier in the summer. Oh, 
okay. I met Don the first time at that meeting in

12:41.284 --> 12:47.534
Indiana on June. Oh, okay. And I think Don was 
already working there. What was his background?

12:54.726 --> 12:57.471
Well, he had worked for Frank at UT Press. He had 
worked in the business office there. He had

13:02.238 --> 13:23.969
worked for Don Barrow and his divisions in the 
country for quite a bit of time. When Lloyd comes,

13:23.989 --> 13:25.671
as you know, he was a citizen of the black military. 
He was high in my opinion. You know, he would ripple

13:26.232 --> 13:27.013
with vaccine. change

13:29.153 --> 13:53.719
in reception, operations? No, there wasn't any 
change in operations. So Margaret and I were

13:54.600 --> 13:55.802
really surprised by the first choice. I don't know 
how much more knowledge Margaret had with that

13:55.822 --> 13:57.203
security. But

13:57.487 --> 14:19.855
I had no idea that Frank was going to go on OSU Press. 
I had heard of him, but I can't get that out of the

14:19.875 --> 14:21.096
business. He just started OSU Press a year before, 
after being out of the business for several years.

14:22.959 --> 14:23.359
And he surprised me. I think the reason that Frank 
did a lot of

14:24.284 --> 14:45.572
things, and the recommendation of the former 
director of California came back this way. Who was

14:45.772 --> 14:48.135
at LSU at that time? Les Billabong. Billabong, 
sure. He's still there. Yeah, sure. But Lloyd was

14:53.162 --> 14:53.903
editor-in-chief at LSU. that you've got a foreign 
recommendation Well, he

14:58.388 --> 15:06.517
had worked in California. He was doing an agent 
assistant there. Now, I'm going to ask the Lord to

15:10.021 --> 15:18.310
take it away, but do you think Lloyd, when he came 
here, he was there? Yes. Okay. That may be obvious.

15:19.652 --> 15:20.353
That was very obvious. That was it. And I always got 
the impression that made Lloyd feel very

15:23.777 --> 15:26.860
uncomfortable, because he said many times, when 
he was here, he was never... Well,

15:26.840 --> 15:52.020
that's

15:26.840 --> 15:52.020
one of

15:26.840 --> 15:52.020
the things I wanted to say. I

15:52.405 --> 16:19.431
guess

15:52.405 --> 16:19.431
I never got around to saying it, but it was really, 
in a way, I don't know exactly how the word goes, but

15:52.405 --> 16:19.431
I'll just be straightforward. In a way, I somewhat 
regretted having taken this job, because after I

16:19.451 --> 16:21.973
got here, I found out that Frank did everything 
himself. and she

16:22.375 --> 16:33.533
didn't delegate much to the campaign guys, which 
is what we agreed with her to do. We probably didn't

16:35.183 --> 16:47.928
get as much experience in management and 
acquisitions as we could if we'd been working

16:35.183 --> 16:47.928
somewhere else. We'd given us a little more 
responsibility. But Frank was just so familiar

16:49.932 --> 16:56.905
with the work and the people involved that if he 
wanted to track down and make a script to pick up the

16:57.644 --> 17:06.840
phone and call him and leave him with some good 
news. And he wouldn't say, no, James is going to

17:06.860 --> 17:09.845
follow suit when we get that project. He'd do it 
himself. He did a lot of that. He was very

17:12.249 --> 17:13.611
self-reliant. And that's very important, very 
useful. He would share information. Sure. It was

17:18.268 --> 17:20.551
just his way of information. It was informative. 
He was not just letting us know what to expect,

17:22.173 --> 17:29.622
rather than asking us to fix it. Good. That's very 
important. So that was just his way of working.

17:35.029 --> 17:35.249
Isn't it? As this thing developed, and including 
this guy, how can you leave everybody to keep

17:35.269 --> 17:44.020
everything real, traveling before it comes to the 
end of the world, instead of you and everybody

17:35.269 --> 17:44.020
else? Well,

17:44.506 --> 18:11.374
it was quite a transition for

17:44.506 --> 18:11.374
me

17:44.506 --> 18:11.374
because

18:12.265 --> 18:21.124
Um,

18:12.265 --> 18:21.124
so the bullet started in, what was it, fall of 79? 
Yeah, six months before the fire. 78. 78. 78,

18:23.710 --> 18:26.035
that's right. Yeah. And, uh, then the fire hit and 
that, uh, That

18:33.241 --> 18:54.991
fire made quite a difference in our health 
operation. We were having to work in the warehouse

18:55.011 --> 18:56.793
for a while, and then we moved into the trailers. 
Immediately after the fire, we were trying to

18:56.813 --> 18:58.556
salvage as many of our files as we could. 
Fortunately, we didn't lose a lot of our

18:58.576 --> 18:59.637
manuscripts.

19:05.303 --> 19:18.413
And I think the fire took some of the

19:05.303 --> 19:18.413
head out of Lois. They pulled right out.

19:37.872 --> 19:57.896
If, if over 10, you was talking, um, you know, 
around the end of

19:37.872 --> 19:57.896
the 99. I thought I had done that. And, uh, set some 
things aside and, uh, get here at the top. Yeah, we

20:04.063 --> 20:05.445
had been out of town past two weeks. Oh, I know. 
Father,

20:05.918 --> 20:30.338
what I'm going to do, I'm going to let you rest for a 
little while, but I'm going to come back to you in

20:05.918 --> 20:30.338
the morning and look at the process. Well, I can 
probably take that stuff off. It's yours. One

20:31.788 --> 20:36.694
more. In

20:37.775 --> 20:59.162
those

20:37.775 --> 20:59.162
years, the fire, The building, of course, is at our 
office. I think the advisory

21:07.354 --> 21:15.949
council is coming over to fill in the seals. And 
then, you know, I can use that. It's not very true.

21:19.275 --> 21:20.577
The one longer term in this building,

21:23.628 --> 21:44.949
It

21:23.628 --> 21:44.949
was very fun. They had a party, and we'd see his 
barbecue, and we had a lot of fun. As I say, I think

21:46.370 --> 21:49.213
there was a time or two there that he was still in 
attendance, and I was probably still in the

21:46.370 --> 21:49.213
hospital field in transition. Was

21:51.151 --> 22:17.896
the Press having any other, I guess we're not 
following this anymore, involvement with or

21:51.151 --> 22:17.896
other administrations between at this 
particular, you know, study, late 70s, you know,

21:51.151 --> 22:17.896
and I think I'm thinking of Frank Cooper and people 
like that. Do you think there were any emotions

22:17.916 --> 22:18.917
there at all? I don't know why I picked up on that, 
but there was something. There was, I think,

22:20.199 --> 22:20.719
Frank. that

22:22.218 --> 22:44.748
Lloyd had really liked Frank Hubert's music. 
Frank was a supportive interest at the time that we

22:44.768 --> 22:46.230
were in the trailers. And after about two years in 
the trailers, Lloyd went to Frank Hubert. and

22:49.825 --> 23:11.212
building, how much did both of you have to do? And 
was Frank Hubert, who then decided, we're going to

23:11.232 --> 23:14.536
set aside some money to build a new press building, 
just for the press, and we're going to build a new

23:11.232 --> 23:14.536
office. Who then actually got things started with 
your building? That's where, not only was I going

23:15.697 --> 23:17.740
to have the letters, but then I picked up a letter 
from the office. I'm not

23:18.327 --> 23:31.645
sure I'm going to interview you. I know

23:32.080 --> 23:48.074
I've talked

23:32.080 --> 23:48.074
to him

23:32.080 --> 23:48.074
just a couple of years ago. I had learned that from 
our sales, and I spoke to him, and we talked a little

23:49.916 --> 23:57.863
bit about his influence in getting the building, 
and I think he's secretly proud of what he did, and

23:49.916 --> 23:57.863
he should be. He really supported the class and 
kept us going through a really tough time. And

24:00.325 --> 24:01.446
another thing that he did was he supported my 
doing. a

24:02.843 --> 24:27.837
second appropriation to the university. Frank 
had, I think Frank had received $200,000 from the

24:27.857 --> 24:31.382
university, and when we started out, that was the 
seed money for the Capitol, that we used outside of

24:27.857 --> 24:31.382
the funded series. And Lloyd, lloyd

24:32.594 --> 24:47.413
did the same thing after hubert was the person who 
was responsible for that and i don't i don't know

24:32.594 --> 24:47.413
i'm sure he stood up before before to

24:48.102 --> 25:09.613
represent the medicine and other information 
that you already have. Okay, very nice to meet you.

25:10.213 --> 25:10.834
I'm going to turn the light on. This became a thing, 
though. Subvention, of course, or appropriation

25:11.435 --> 25:12.437
of things. That is present.

25:18.764 --> 25:44.991
What,

25:18.764 --> 25:44.991
you know, when Lloyd comes in as the director, does 
your role change, my role at first, of course,

25:18.764 --> 25:44.991
because Margaret is still the manager, and 
Margaret, again, is the manager. They'll

25:46.017 --> 26:10.811
have us in February of any time. Actually, I 
started March 1st. And of course, I began to work

26:11.452 --> 26:12.553
directly with the board. I was pretty close. We 
were good. Well, we were good, yeah. We did. The

26:14.941 --> 26:24.073
board, there are a lot of acquisitions, a lot more 
than other directors of other places. But I also,

26:24.492 --> 26:30.344
you know, they were just the two of us. And of course 
in 81, late 81 and early 82,

26:30.364 --> 26:42.568
we started drawing the list. I think it was Boyd's 
intent to double the size of the list and draw up

26:42.588 --> 26:45.353
about 30 books a year, which we did. Again,

26:46.902 --> 27:11.492
I did cause some cash flow problems, and I played 
back to the second appropriation, and the person

26:46.902 --> 27:11.492
who helped us out was Holmes, who helped us handle a 
lot of their problems.

27:14.695 --> 27:33.979
Because

27:14.695 --> 27:33.979
we were publishing a lot of things that were not 
covered by the public series. It was hard to

27:33.999 --> 27:35.261
increase the list, double the list, and wrap it. 
But I think we had reached a stage that You either

27:38.253 --> 27:54.859
had

27:38.253 --> 27:54.859
Tim Rowe, or Toole, or Stackman, or Frank 
Willoughby, or the irrespective Frank's wish to

27:38.253 --> 27:54.859
keep press small and compact. Was it a matter of 
public relations, or was it a matter of just

27:55.160 --> 27:58.125
dollars? Was it liable to the military? The reason 
of the abandonment? I think it was both. He wanted

28:07.647 --> 28:15.119
the status of the larger press. He wanted the

28:15.239 --> 28:22.691
recognition. That's right. The school was 
growing. I think it was about 27 months. Yeah.

28:46.633 --> 28:46.733
Yeah. Yeah. all

28:49.735 --> 29:14.414
my friends

28:49.735 --> 29:14.414
in high school and my mother in high school.

29:14.434 --> 29:17.599
But we jumped the size of the list, and I think that 
was a very important stage, and probably one of the

29:14.434 --> 29:17.599
most important things that we did was taking a 
chance Any

29:18.693 --> 29:40.044
difference

29:18.693 --> 29:40.044
in erection? I don't know if you were doing the fat 
cartilages here. No, it stayed pretty much the

29:42.067 --> 29:43.669
same as far as the content. Okay. I

29:46.300 --> 30:06.688
can't think of anything then that was made. When

30:07.124 --> 30:27.193
did the distribution system, where did that come 
from? Oh, that came later. It was in 1983 or 84 when

30:27.633 --> 30:28.595
we started publishing. We started an arrangement 
with the Federal Reserve and the Texas State

30:28.615 --> 30:30.297
Department of Well, I think Ron Paul

30:33.145 --> 30:42.685
is responsible for that idea. He thought that 
would be a good way to supplement our income. And

30:48.617 --> 30:52.605
Rice and PSHA wanted that kind of bill. So

30:52.585 --> 31:15.035
it seemed mutually beneficial, and we suggested 
that people, since we had this new warehouse, it

30:52.585 --> 31:15.035
was feasible for us to have this. We had the storage 
space there, too. And we put that warehouse under

31:15.796 --> 31:16.517
use. And then we added TCU, and this, and this.

31:21.340 --> 31:27.427
I

31:21.340 --> 31:27.427
don't know if we added TCU. I don't know what you're 
going after. Just keep breaking into the

31:28.211 --> 31:28.954
stowaway.
