WEBVTT

00:01.718 --> 00:11.811
They were in the process of trying to change it from 
a marketing to a total chemical organization when

00:01.718 --> 00:11.811
I went in there. And so we were evolving from 
marketing into, and that's why I was in the

00:11.832 --> 00:20.443
projects and long-range planning was to start the 
planning process. Humble Oil still had

00:21.044 --> 00:27.793
responsibility for running the manufacturing 
operation. In fact, NJ reported to Humble Oil

00:27.813 --> 00:31.658
Refining Company in Houston. Mr. Morgan Davis and 
then Mr. Ricey.

00:37.307 --> 00:43.099
So the industry, though, really is going through a 
considerable whatever change, catharsis? I

00:44.142 --> 00:52.920
think Exxon was probably one of the early ones to 
split off chemicals from petroleum operations to

00:44.142 --> 00:52.920
make a separate unit. We were in the midst of a very 
high growth era in petrochemicals. The total size

00:58.408 --> 01:07.441
of the chemical business, as I said, in the 63, the 
year I was there, was $50 billion, all inclusive.

01:07.461 --> 01:13.250
And today it's $1.4, $1.5 trillion.

01:13.270 --> 01:17.576
Well, that's worldwide. That's all chemical. 
Everything. It was a very small industry in 1963.

01:25.189 --> 01:38.903
So the growth, there was double-digit growth in 
the petrochemical business from 1960 through the

01:25.189 --> 01:38.903
early 70s until the first oil shock.

01:38.923 --> 01:41.645
Tremendous growth in Europe, you know, like 20% a 
year.

01:49.833 --> 01:52.776
And you're going to stay within J&M for how long? 
Well I go from projects and long-range planning to

01:53.195 --> 02:17.582
I was given a job as in the plastics division as the 
operations and planning manager with

01:53.195 --> 02:17.582
responsibility to get us into polyethylene and 
then I became head of the plastics division then I

01:53.195 --> 02:17.582
got transferred to Odenton Maryland and In 
Maryland, we had a company called NJ Fibers and

02:18.035 --> 02:21.560
Laminates. So it was a fibers and a decorative 
laminate, one that competed with Formica. So when

02:28.049 --> 02:34.038
you had what you used to make Formica, I knew 
exactly what you were talking about. You did that.

02:35.740 --> 02:39.445
We made a product called Nevermar, 
N-E-V-A-M-A-R. Nevermar? Yeah. Is that still a

02:40.307 --> 02:41.649
brand? It's still around, yeah. And our biggest 
competitors, there were two of them. One was Ralph

02:46.576 --> 02:47.637
Wilson. And Ralph Wilson was down in Temple, 
Texas. And American Sign of it was made for MICA.

02:57.630 --> 02:58.191
And GE. GE made decorative laminates until they 
finally decided to go out of the decorative

02:58.852 --> 03:15.550
laminate and they made laminates for these 
control boards, you know, these electronic...

02:58.852 --> 03:15.550
All of those things are nothing more than... 
They're exactly... You take one of these...

03:18.380 --> 03:31.978
Boards that go into a computer, that's the same as 
what was used in Formica, except it doesn't have a

03:18.380 --> 03:31.978
decorative sheet on it. It's phenol 
formaldehyde.

03:36.244 --> 03:45.957
So then I go down as executive VP of NJ Fibers and 
Laminates with the responsibility to replace the

03:36.244 --> 03:45.957
president. And he knows I came there to replace 
him, but nobody else knows. And so... That's

03:51.501 --> 03:55.726
roughly what year now? 68. Okay. And I was there 18 
months.

04:05.857 --> 04:13.345
And then I moved back to NJ as a vice president with 
responsibility for half of the product lines. I'm

04:15.755 --> 04:22.384
there for... Yeah, when you say... Yeah, I 
replaced him. He left, and I took his place. We had a

04:26.329 --> 04:31.656
strike while I was there, and we had 1,400 
employees, so it was a pretty good size operation.

04:33.638 --> 04:44.412
When we had the strike, we were having a few 
problems with the pickets and things like that,

04:33.638 --> 04:44.412
and these two enterprising young girls put an RV 
across in the parking lot And the line went over to

04:44.932 --> 04:52.182
the RV because they were prostitutes from East 
Baltimore. During the strike? During the strike,

04:53.144 --> 04:55.006
and so we had no more prostitutes. Now that is 
enterprising. Yeah, right. That is

04:56.629 --> 05:00.073
enterprising.

05:00.154 --> 05:04.339
The guy who ran the Maryland State Police was a guy 
named Captain Smith. I'd always made it a point to

05:05.581 --> 05:09.707
meet the chief of police and in either the state, 
county, or city, wherever I was. So if I ever got in

05:13.634 --> 05:16.117
trouble, I'd always have somebody to call on. And 
so I was good buddies with Captain Smith, and he

05:17.018 --> 05:23.726
asked me, you want me to move them? I said, no, I'll 
leave them there. It's better now than it used to

05:25.769 --> 05:29.053
be. Well, now, when you were vice president for the 
products. Well, we had 10 product lines, OK? And I

05:36.201 --> 05:39.205
said I had half of them. the plastics, elastomers, 
adhesives, fabricated products,

05:39.438 --> 05:53.315
and the other guy had the raw materials and 
industrial chemicals. That would be ethylene, I

05:53.335 --> 06:04.669
mean the olefins, aromatics, the alcohols,

06:05.341 --> 06:06.703
whatever else we had. M.E.K. No, you primarily, 
your day-to-day work is primarily involving

06:07.445 --> 06:12.534
production or marketing again? Everything. All 
of the above? Everything. That's what I was

06:15.098 --> 06:15.659
wondering. Okay. Yeah, we're a complete company, 
but they separated out the chemicals from the oil

06:15.799 --> 06:23.513
side officially in 1964. 64. 64. They formed a 
separate company, and then in 19... By 1966,

06:31.649 --> 06:35.874
everything was totally separate. It took about 
two years worldwide.

06:41.460 --> 06:50.750
So now as the vice president with NJ again, how long 
was that going to take? That lasted for six months,

06:50.770 --> 06:54.374
and then I got transferred to Europe. Oh, you 
really are moving fast. I moved to Brussels. I

06:58.479 --> 07:00.441
actually moved back. I got transferred to NJ back 
in the fall of 69,

07:01.788 --> 07:14.386
but I couldn't move until the school semester, 
which was February. I moved in February, and on

07:15.187 --> 07:24.360
June the 1st, I was on my way to Brussels to look for a 
place to live. And when I got my first passport, it

07:24.380 --> 07:31.170
was not for just to take a trip out it was to move so we 
moved to brussels in the summer of 70. stayed there

07:31.420 --> 08:01.360
through the summer of 73. how'd your family like 
that loved it it was great disappointed to come

07:31.420 --> 08:01.360
back what ages were they kids i had one daughter who 
had three senior rings she had a senior ring in

07:31.420 --> 08:01.360
maryland first half the junior year she got a 
senior ring in new canaan the second half of the

08:02.639 --> 08:31.937
junior year and she got a senior ring in brussels 
the senior year so she spent one year and graduated

08:02.639 --> 08:31.937
from international school of brussels that's a 
couple of seniors she swore down she wasn't going

08:02.639 --> 08:31.937
to go and i told her you know that when you start 
making the money in the family you make the

08:02.639 --> 08:31.937
decisions until then i'll make the decision i said 
you're going right now she already worked it out to

08:02.639 --> 08:31.937
live with somebody i said no way yeah i said no way 
you're going yeah And she enjoyed the hell out of

08:32.626 --> 08:37.590
it. So you were in Brussels three years. My three 
daughters are four years apart and eight years

08:42.555 --> 08:46.639
apart. So there's a 12-year span. So we were in 
Brussels for three years. I was vice president of

08:51.223 --> 08:53.745
SO Chem Group. And I had responsibility for 
plastics and elastomers. Moved back to New York.

09:02.123 --> 09:04.566
and New Canaan. In 73, as a product line VP, we'd 
gone to a product line organization where each of

09:04.586 --> 09:16.520
the product areas had a VP. Then I moved in 78 to 
Houston to run the organization in Houston, which

09:16.540 --> 09:24.089
is Exxon Kim Americas. Okay, now when was that 
formed, Exxon Kim Americas? That's NJ. That is NJ.

09:30.091 --> 09:31.632
NJ changed its name. When we changed our name to 
Exxon in 72, we changed Exxon Chemical. We're the

09:39.740 --> 09:43.384
only part of Exxon that uses Exxon worldwide. The 
oil side uses Esso outside the U.S. and Exxon in the

09:43.404 --> 09:49.670
U.S. So NJ Chemical Company became Exxon Chem 
Americas. In 72? In 72. Okay. It was moved to

09:58.807 --> 10:10.485
Houston

09:58.807 --> 10:10.485
in 1970, the same time that I moved to Brussels.

10:10.505 --> 10:16.835
We were located on the 610 loop right there where 
Post Oak is. We were in one of those twin towers that

10:16.855 --> 10:22.924
belonged to Tenneco that's been vacant now 
because of asbestos.

10:25.402 --> 10:33.210
So

10:25.402 --> 10:33.210
you're coming to Houston. In 78, so first time 
back. I stayed here for three years. Now why was

10:38.475 --> 10:41.378
that decision made? Why move that? Well, it was the 
next step up, you know, from the standpoint. We had

10:47.964 --> 10:52.549
both a product line organization and a renewal 
organization. And the regional organization did

10:55.405 --> 11:01.774
basically the implementation, which run the 
manufacturing plants and do the selling. The

11:02.254 --> 11:06.480
product lines basically did the planning, the 
strategic planning of where we're going. So it was

11:07.001 --> 11:08.603
a different type of experience. So I came down here 
in 78 and was here for three years. Built this

11:18.696 --> 11:20.238
building while we were here. We were, as I said, on 
610 Luke. And your title, again, here now?

11:24.942 --> 11:26.564
President of Exxon Kim Americas. President of 
Exxon Kim Americas. Right. And that's where I was

11:30.708 --> 11:44.041
when

11:30.708 --> 11:44.041
Holland first formed his group on the Lindsay 
thing. Yeah, his first advisory group. Well, I

11:45.523 --> 11:47.265
went there in 1966. I recommend that I go there. So

11:48.950 --> 12:14.355
I

11:48.950 --> 12:14.355
was here three years and then I get transferred 
back to New York as the executive vice president of

11:48.950 --> 12:14.355
Exxon International. So after spending what 26 
years in the chemical business I get transferred

12:18.582 --> 12:22.969
to the oil side. And I spent four and a half years as 
vice president of Exxon International. Okay,

12:28.298 --> 12:29.320
let's see those dates. Let me get roughly those. 81 
to 85. Okay. Now, my guess is you were really

12:37.293 --> 12:40.438
traveling the world about that time, were you? I 
did more traveling when I was the VP of Plastics in

12:41.110 --> 12:47.140
New York. Is that right? Yeah. That's when I went to 
Saudi Arabia 27 times. I negotiated the agreement

12:51.969 --> 12:56.316
with the Saudis for building a plant in Jebel. And 
since we were working in New York City, you don't

12:57.819 --> 13:05.312
count the days you're out of the country or out of 
the state. for tax purposes, and you keep accurate

13:05.832 --> 13:09.557
records. I was outside the U.S. in 19, what was it, 
76, 63% of the days.

13:22.675 --> 13:27.923
What was the thrust now of Exxon International in 
those years, 81, 85? Exxon International

13:28.383 --> 13:34.692
basically is the supply arm to all of Exxon's 
petroleum operations. They run the marine

13:35.363 --> 13:39.010
operation, which is the transportation of crude 
oil. They acquire the crude oil. They do all of what

13:41.515 --> 13:46.565
we call contract-type sales. In other words, they 
sell aviation gasoline. They sell ship bunkers.

13:51.053 --> 13:53.578
They sell ship lubes. So it's a... Supply, 
transportation, and commodity type trading. And

14:00.817 --> 14:05.543
you're primarily involved in movement, 
distribution, planning. Yep. We had the third

14:07.265 --> 14:11.151
largest Navy in the world. 126 ships. In tonnage, 
it was the third largest. We were smaller than the

14:16.297 --> 14:19.782
U.S. and the Russian Navy.

14:26.596 --> 14:32.083
So, and in 85, now, and you're based, you're 
stationed now, you're based out of New York. Well,

14:32.304 --> 14:38.712
we were in New York until 83, and we moved to New 
Jersey, okay? The company moved to New Jersey. So I

14:41.296 --> 14:54.173
was in New Jersey at that time, and I knew that Ed 
Homer was going to retire as president of Exxon

14:41.296 --> 14:54.173
Chemical in 86, and lo and behold, in 85, They 
transferred me to Reliance Electric to take the

14:54.676 --> 15:08.356
job as president of Reliance Electric to get me out 
of the way, I thought.

15:08.376 --> 15:16.788
And I went out there as executive VP working for a 
guy named John Morley, and they were going to move

15:08.376 --> 15:16.788
Morley to New York. He was a treasurer by 
background. They couldn't find a job for him in New

15:20.193 --> 15:24.379
York, so they put off my taking over his job from 
January 1st to April 1st. Then they put it off from

15:26.838 --> 15:30.183
April 1st to July 1st. And then they put it off from 
July 1st to September 1st. And by that point in

15:34.109 --> 15:42.041
time, we'd already made plans to sell Reliance 
Electric. So I'm there 15 months from October of 85

15:42.061 --> 15:47.229
to December the 31st, 86. And I never take over the 
job I went out there to take. I had the option of

15:52.928 --> 16:00.035
staying with the Reliance, and I said, no, I'm 
going to go back. So they offered me a job, which was

16:00.756 --> 16:07.323
vacant at that time, as executive vice president 
of Exxon Chemical. And it was located in Derry Inn.

16:11.047 --> 16:12.989
So that was January 1, 87. And in 1990, in December, 
the the guy who just retired as president of Exxon

16:20.182 --> 16:28.031
named Chuck Sitter, he came to me and he said, how 
much longer are you willing to work? And I said,

16:28.051 --> 16:29.493
about another six months. Why? I said, I'm tired of 
the Northeast. I want to go back to Texas. He said,

16:35.741 --> 16:39.625
well, what did it take to get you to stay for five 
years? At that time, I'm 57. I said, we'd had to move

16:43.670 --> 16:46.674
the company to Texas. He said, well, go ahead. And 
that's the way it was? That's the way it was. I said,

16:51.480 --> 16:53.423
well, I'll come down and make a presentation. You 
really had not thought about that. They said,

16:56.126 --> 16:58.069
don't bother. And then they called me up and said, 
don't bother to come down. There's one place you

17:03.175 --> 17:04.737
can't go to. I said, where is that? They said, 
that's Dallas. I said, well, hell, that's no

17:07.841 --> 17:09.143
problem. I said, I was going to take it to Marshall 
anyway. There are two places you can't go to. That

17:16.983 --> 17:18.986
actually happened. Two places you can't go to. So 
we moved down here in the summer of 91. So from

17:29.063 --> 17:31.528
December, we didn't waste much time. We moved as 
soon as the school year was out. And none of this was

17:35.594 --> 17:39.561
on track or online before this happened? No. This 
came up in December and February, I came down

17:43.865 --> 17:46.629
looking for office space. And in June, July, we 
were occupying offices over in Westlake, you

17:47.851 --> 17:58.506
know, Amoco building next door. And while we built 
this section on the added section on this building

17:59.527 --> 18:05.976
here. So the guy who was running the company at that 
time, that they already knew he was retiring and

18:10.679 --> 18:24.275
that's why they asked me if I'm willing to stay for 
five years and so he retired at the end of 91 and I've

18:10.679 --> 18:24.275
been running the chemical company since then. So 
you've been here since 91 in this location? In this

18:28.220 --> 18:31.624
location since 91. And when we got here so late in 
the year, I couldn't get tickets to the damn

18:32.043 --> 18:37.091
football game. And I said, what would it take to 
get, you know, some preferred seating type

18:38.012 --> 18:42.699
tickets? They said, well, you've got to give an 
endowed scholarship. I said, okay. So I gave an

18:48.048 --> 18:51.313
endowed scholarship, got my two tickets. That's 
the hard way to do it. It was costly. If you could

18:54.117 --> 19:00.647
have come to the history department, I think we 
could have done something. Yeah.

19:04.797 --> 19:09.524
Now,

19:04.797 --> 19:09.524
what direction? Where are chemicals going? Where 
is Exxon Chemicals going? Petrochemicals? Well,

19:13.791 --> 19:17.837
you know, our basic objective is to become a bigger 
part of Exxon. We've normally been 10% of their

19:19.520 --> 19:26.290
sales and about 10% of their capital. In sales, 
since the price of crude oil was up last year, we're

19:26.491 --> 19:32.099
still 10% of their sales. We're about... 14 or 15% 
of their capital and about 16 or 17% of their

19:33.755 --> 19:40.783
earnings. And we want to be 20% of the capital in 
earnings five years from now. And what does it take

19:46.890 --> 19:48.472
to do that? It takes a lot of investments. Yeah, 
more plant? Yeah. International? Domestic?

19:53.718 --> 19:57.142
Basically, we're going to spend most of our 
capital in Asia Pacific. Most of our big capital in

19:57.362 --> 20:00.906
Asia Pacific. We're currently... Working on two 
projects, I guess. One's $2 billion and the, well,

20:07.938 --> 20:12.444
three, if you talk about China. It'll be in the 
league of $2 billion. And then we've got over a

20:15.729 --> 20:19.914
billion dollars we're spending in Saudi Arabia 
right now. All to supply Asia Pacific. In what? In

20:23.620 --> 20:25.082
polyesters? In gasoline? Ethylene, propylene, 
polyethylene, polypropylene. Oxo alcohols,

20:32.345 --> 20:58.420
phthalic anhydride, plasticizers that go into 
PVC, solvents,

20:32.345 --> 20:58.420
but you know, we don't have to expand things like 
butyl rubber or Vistalon or some of the other types

20:32.345 --> 20:58.420
of products because they're things that can be 
shipped worldwide.

21:03.361 --> 21:24.230
So we've come from number 15 in the world when we 
separated out in the early 60s, 62, 63, with sales

21:03.361 --> 21:24.230
of $375 million to where this year we'll do, last 
year we did $13.5 billion.

21:24.250 --> 21:31.039
We have roughly 14,000 employees plus about 4,000 
contractors. but that's down from 18,000

21:32.993 --> 21:39.662
employees and 6,000 contractors in 1990. So we've

22:04.355 --> 22:14.258

appreciate your review.
