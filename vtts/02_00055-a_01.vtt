WEBVTT

00:02.832 --> 00:11.147
June the 19th, in Fort Worth, having the pleasure 
of talking to Jim Creel. Jim, you grew up where?

00:17.118 --> 00:19.322
Most of my early years were in Denton. My father was 
city manager there, and then about the time I was

00:19.808 --> 00:29.297
about 10 years old, we moved forward, and I've been 
here ever since. I came back here after getting out

00:29.317 --> 00:35.503
of school and have been practicing law basically 
here ever since then. The first important

00:36.184 --> 00:37.846
question. Why did you attend Texas A&M? Well, I

00:41.209 --> 00:46.474
have always... had people say, well, you've never 
had any choice. I don't know that that's true. I did

00:50.993 --> 00:51.874
have a choice. But my dad had gone there. My mother 
had worked there before the war. And I used to tell

01:01.271 --> 01:07.403
people that, jokingly, that my parents supported 
A&M before they supported me. And I also knew just

01:11.328 --> 01:13.372
enough about it to want to go there. And I knew just 
enough. I knew little enough about it that I didn't

01:15.176 --> 01:19.466
think I knew everything that I would find. So I'd 
always had the plan to go there. And I'm always

01:23.274 --> 01:25.700
typically glad I did. You had visited there a 
number of times before you enrolled. I'd been

01:28.365 --> 01:31.412
there with my folks primarily. and thought I knew 
something about it. When I got there my first year

01:33.749 --> 01:38.052
in the Corps, I decided I didn't know anything 
about it. And maybe I made a bad decision. But no, I

01:42.036 --> 01:44.818
felt like I knew what I was getting into. Describe 
for me the trip down there when you're going to

01:45.179 --> 01:49.903
enroll. How did you get there? What did you take 
with you? What gear? What baggage? I remember that

01:56.749 --> 02:00.792
my parents took me there. They took me in the family 
car, and we unloaded just the things that we'd been

02:02.392 --> 02:11.123
told to bring, the basic essentials. I had gone 
down there in the summer earlier. In fact, I went to

02:15.669 --> 02:20.816
summer school in Junction before that. And then I 
went to the orientation. freshman orientation at

02:24.380 --> 02:25.922
A&M. And I went there by myself because I thought I 
had it all figured out. But my parents took me down

02:29.167 --> 02:33.173
there in September of 1965. And

02:33.454 --> 02:40.504
it dropped

02:33.454 --> 02:40.504
me off. And I think after that, reality hit me. This 
was for real. Describe the campus when you

02:47.154 --> 02:49.798
arrived. What was there?

02:53.877 --> 03:08.281
The only thing I really remember about it at 
Haskell was that we approached the core dorm area

02:53.877 --> 03:08.281
and there were lots of people who I thought were 
about like me already out in the area. They'd

03:08.301 --> 03:10.925
already had some of the freshmen out marching and 
drilling. I got moved in and I went over to the MSC

03:10.945 --> 03:15.092
and got my Fish haircut, which I still remember my 
mother was aghast at. But that's the main thing

03:20.543 --> 03:25.570
that I remember that particular time. I remember 
that it was hot. Mid-September is always hot, of

03:27.673 --> 03:31.018
course. But that's my initial impression. I 
wasn't thinking much about the campus. I was just

03:35.705 --> 03:36.967
thinking about moving in. You're in the Corps. 
What outfit? What dorm? I was in Company A2. And

03:46.358 --> 03:50.663
when we first moved there, we were in dorm three. 
Within about a week, we moved to dorm one. And I

03:54.026 --> 03:58.130
lived there for all of my freshman year. I often say 
now that all the students refer to the dorms by

03:59.972 --> 04:03.796
name. And back then, I guess none of us were too 
bright. We all went by dorm number. I guess we

04:09.122 --> 04:10.704
couldn't have remembered all the names. Did your 
outfit have a nickname? A Battery. Company A2, A

04:15.400 --> 04:17.883
Battery Field Artillery. They didn't have the 
unit designations as they did back in World War II,

04:18.704 --> 04:27.416
but that outfit had retained its designation. It 
was an Army outfit. Describe your room as a fish.

04:34.166 --> 04:35.808
What was in there? Two walls, a door, a window. 
Absolutely no... My goodness, when I looked at my

04:46.332 --> 04:55.140
daughter's dorm room as a freshman last year, her 
room looked like an electronics store compared to

04:46.332 --> 04:55.140
what mine was like. It was very sparkly. What 
furniture?

05:03.427 --> 05:04.748
Beds, bunk beds. There was a metal chest of drawers 
that each roommate got about two drawers or three

05:07.090 --> 05:14.517
drawers of it. There was an old, each student had a 
desk and a chair with plastic sort of, I'm not sure

05:14.969 --> 05:27.203
what the material was, sort of like plastic arms in 
the back. I think it was a wooden desk, although it

05:28.064 --> 05:31.387
may have been metal and I just don't remember. And 
that was about it. It was a sink built into the wall

05:34.651 --> 05:36.993
with a mirror. I can still remember that, but 
that's about all you got. Alright, and the toilet

05:39.977 --> 05:42.900
and gang showers, gang toilets down the hall, two 
on each floor. And

05:49.294 --> 05:58.344
freshmen could have a footlocker where you kept 
most of your stuff. You lived out of your

05:58.384 --> 06:04.170
footlocker and you had a closet, a very small, very 
small closet. And you could have a certain number

06:04.190 --> 06:09.175
of civilian things in there, but you really didn't 
have much need Describe the typical weekday

06:09.965 --> 06:14.749
routine for a fish. What time did you get up, what 
did you do, and what sequence?

06:22.176 --> 06:24.478
I hadn't thought about this in years. Probably got 
up about 6, although I may be wrong about that. You

06:31.425 --> 06:33.206
wake up, have morning formation. March to 
breakfast during morning formation. Sophomores

06:36.890 --> 06:39.212
would inspect your uniform. March to breakfast, 
eat breakfast, come back. You usually have a

06:44.215 --> 06:51.546
little bit of time for last minute studying if you 
needed to, but mainly what you do is clean your room

06:44.215 --> 06:51.546
for inspection. You go to class, come back, have 
lunch formation, march to lunch. And then in the

07:00.739 --> 07:05.085
afternoon, if you had class, you'd go there. Most 
of the people would try to take that time in the

07:07.137 --> 07:10.400
afternoon to catch up on a little sleep if you 
could. So usually there was more sleeping that

07:10.500 --> 07:14.243
went on in the dorm in the afternoon than at night. 
And then in the evening you'd have evening

07:15.024 --> 07:32.278
formation, march to suppu, come back and have 
study time, call the quarters, study time, until

07:15.024 --> 07:32.278
about 10 o'clock, 10.30, and then it was lights out 
for freshmen. Did you have any upperclassmen's

07:32.999 --> 07:36.942
room for which you were responsible? the fish no uh 
i was i was pretty lucky i had a i had a i lived right

07:37.850 --> 07:59.470
next door to a senior who was from tarrant county he 
was a outstanding guy fine man ended up getting his

07:37.850 --> 07:59.470
phd in civil engineering at am and uh And as a result 
of that, rather than suffering some of the horror

07:59.872 --> 08:11.287
stories that many other people suffered down 
there, I was spared a little bit of that because he

07:59.872 --> 08:11.287
was a very high class guy. So I didn't have some of 
the abuse that other people had. Can you describe

08:14.732 --> 08:23.483
any of the, what an outsider might call, hazing 
that went on?

08:24.357 --> 08:29.203
I know for a fact that that sort of thing varied from 
outfit to outfit. And we didn't have as much of it in

08:29.584 --> 08:31.646
my outfit. There were some outfits that people 
would get their rear ends beat with broom handles.

08:37.614 --> 08:41.158
I had a little bit of that, but not much. Most of the 
hazing was the type that, well, mental hazing.

08:51.354 --> 08:55.780
There was usually some, if you didn't know a 
campusology question, you might have to do

08:51.354 --> 08:55.780
push-ups. There were times when they'd take all 
the freshmen out and haze them with push-ups or

08:56.100 --> 09:06.955
sit-ups or something, but that was pretty much the 
extent of it, at least in my outfit. In your outfit,

09:06.975 --> 09:19.812
were there any ever any retribution activities to 
strike back at a sophomore or junior or senior who

09:06.975 --> 09:19.812
took advantage of some fish?

09:23.977 --> 09:25.659
I don't remember. I'm sure if I really thought back 
about it, I probably would call some. I'm not sure

09:29.984 --> 09:32.867
that I remember any specific ones. I do know that 
there was always the situation at that time, sort

09:32.887 --> 09:43.180
of a tradition, that the freshmen would steal 
their company commander's footlocker. And that

09:43.200 --> 09:52.110
was sort of an opportunity for the upperclassmen 
to, in an organized manner, haze the freshmen. I

09:52.327 --> 10:04.968
seem to recall that in our outfit, the idea was that 
you were supposed to somehow get your CO's

09:52.327 --> 10:04.968
footlocker into the stadium for the Thanksgiving 
Day game, take it on the field, and leave it. And the

10:05.729 --> 10:09.255
story that I seem to remember in my outfit was that 
We did have a freshman who managed with one or two

10:09.607 --> 10:14.732
others to get our CO's footlocker into the 
stadium. And of all things, it turned out that they

10:15.253 --> 10:26.685
happened to be seated near or somewhere around our 
CO's mother who wondered why her son's footlocker

10:15.253 --> 10:26.685
was with these other people. But that was a chance 
for about a week or so of organized hazing. And

10:32.832 --> 10:33.893
there was also the Another example of sort of 
organized hazing was before the SMU game, there

10:34.801 --> 10:46.356
was always a requirement that freshmen wear spurs 
because we were playing the SMU Mustang. Made out

10:46.376 --> 10:46.916
of? Made out of beer bottle caps. And that required 
a lot of effort. I had a car. It wasn't rare, but it

10:55.948 --> 11:01.295
was not common for people to have cars. But... I 
went with two or three of my fish buddies, and we

11:04.248 --> 11:15.080
went to one of the beer distributors in Bryan and 
asked if they had some old bottle caps, and they had

11:04.248 --> 11:15.080
some. So we were able to maybe do a little better job 
than some of the other guys. We got just all the

11:19.485 --> 11:26.813
bottle caps we wanted and took them back, and then 
you had to straighten them out. and drill a hole in

11:27.063 --> 11:34.033
them and just a lot of work, just a lot of work to walk 
around the campus wearing those things. They

11:34.053 --> 11:35.375
should put them on coat hangers? Put them on, yeah, 
you'd strap them on, you'd affix them to coat

11:35.555 --> 11:41.884
hangers around the back of your shoes and then 
somehow hook them under. I can't remember exactly

11:41.904 --> 11:43.666
how you did it. You'd make a little apparatus and 
then tie them around so that they were attached to

11:43.686 --> 11:48.613
your shoes. They'd make this god awful noise when 
you'd walk around campus. Because I remember as an

11:52.308 --> 11:57.956
instructor trying to say to the students, OK, I 
know what week this is. Try to keep your feet still

11:58.337 --> 12:01.141
during class. Yeah, yeah. Let's see. Was your 
freshman year roommate a special official lady?

12:08.451 --> 12:11.616
Was that a special relationship for you, a special 
friend? No, actually, we didn't know each other.

12:14.802 --> 12:17.265
We were just thrown together, and we got along 
well. No, did he become a special friend? No, not

12:20.148 --> 12:21.609
really, not really. I saw him about 10 years ago, 
but he only stayed in the Corps for another year or

12:22.470 --> 12:29.617
so, and then left. And so we didn't know. Were there 
some special friends that you made in your outfit?

12:36.905 --> 12:39.207
Yes, there were some. As time progressed, I made, 
probably my best friends were not necessarily

12:40.300 --> 12:49.393
guys that were in my outfit. I still see some of them 
at class reunions and things, but I guess my best

12:49.413 --> 13:02.431
friends were people that I, friends that I made my 
junior and senior year down there. Let's see,

13:02.451 --> 13:04.934
dining hall. Describe some of the dining hall 
routine for a corps member in Duncan. Oh dear,

13:11.114 --> 13:14.658
you're taking me back a long way.

13:17.521 --> 13:26.631
Freshmen had to give meal service, had to sit next 
to an upperclassman, had to give meal service. You

13:27.191 --> 13:35.340
were seated family style, which means there were 
about, as I recall, probably eight people at a

13:27.191 --> 13:35.340
table. Waiters would bring the food in bowls. And 
it was the freshmen's duty to make sure that

13:38.755 --> 13:47.268
everybody had enough to eat, specifically the 
upperclassmen. And they were responsible for

13:47.589 --> 13:54.520
organizing the food dishes to quarter more. If you 
wanted something else to eat, you could always

13:54.540 --> 13:57.084
send it back. They'd have to work with the waiters. 
And sometimes if they had an upperclassman

13:58.886 --> 14:05.657
waiter, they'd get hazed by that upperclassman 
waiter just as much as they would the guys at their

13:58.886 --> 14:05.657
tables. And freshmen really didn't get a chance to 
do much eating until the upperclassmen had left.

14:10.914 --> 14:17.624
And then they had the rule that freshmen could walk 
around and just grab whatever they wanted to off

14:10.914 --> 14:17.624
any of the tables. And so usually about 20 minutes 
after the meal had started, you'd look around and

14:17.704 --> 14:24.894
you'd find just isolated freshmen here and there. 
And that's the way most of us kept from losing any

14:24.954 --> 14:31.763
more weight than we did, was by taking advantage of 
that and eating whatever we could. Well, share

14:32.182 --> 14:38.950
with me, if you can, some of the nicknames for 
various food items. Oh, golly. Boy, I hadn't

14:41.914 --> 14:43.156
thought about this. Oh, dear. Gravy, beans, meat, 
milk, bread.

14:52.688 --> 14:53.308
Let's see. Dessert was kush. That's an easy one. 
Dessert was kush. I remember that. Let's see. Meat

14:59.756 --> 15:01.058
was bull neck. Milk was cow. Shoot the cow.

15:11.341 --> 15:12.363
Good gracious. Ketchup? Blood. That's one of 
those things that's back there in my memory

15:18.511 --> 15:27.783
somewhere, but some guys probably brought their 
kids up teaching them those things, and I never

15:18.511 --> 15:27.783
did, so I can't. Oh, I just thought of one that I'd 
not ask anybody else. I've heard of stories where

15:32.527 --> 15:45.323
that some freshman forgot when he got home and used 
some A&M lingo at the table. Did that happen to you?

15:46.344 --> 15:46.564
No. Some of the food terminology was not exactly 
etiquette that your mother would teach you. Yeah,

15:55.956 --> 15:56.737
that's what I've heard. And that the mother or 
father would say, what? Yeah. And it wasn't... I

16:01.197 --> 16:03.801
knew of stories like that. Do you remember, 
whether it involved you or not, do you remember any

16:04.181 --> 16:09.709
dining hall pranks, jokes? Sure. Share some. Lots 
of times they would be seniors or juniors who would

16:12.753 --> 16:23.728
instruct other freshmen to crawl along the floor 
and Everyone had to sit with their napkins tucked

16:24.265 --> 16:37.141
into their lap, and they'd give somebody a 
cigarette lighter and have them crawl along the

16:24.265 --> 16:37.141
floor and slide it up under a table and light 
somebody's napkin. And of course, if you ever felt

16:37.522 --> 16:48.636
something like that, you could tell it was a 
freshman from some other outfit, so you wouldn't

16:37.522 --> 16:48.636
squeal on a fish buddy and tell the upperclassmen.

16:49.865 --> 16:58.517
Usually at mealtime you were asked campusology 
questions by the sophomore or some other

16:49.865 --> 16:58.517
upperclassmen at your table. And it always, if you 
had upperclassmen who were sports fans, they were

16:58.958 --> 17:11.296
always asking you questions about who was in the 
starting lineup for the Aggies or who was the high

16:58.958 --> 17:11.296
point man for the Aggies the night before or that 
sort of thing. So you always had to be prepared for

17:11.376 --> 17:14.640
things like that.

17:18.045 --> 17:18.606
Those were Once you kind of got in a routine and 
learned the people that were sitting at your

17:19.008 --> 17:27.299
table, it could be kind of fun if you were with good 
people. Please share any of the good bull jokes,

17:28.201 --> 17:40.037
pranks that you knew about while you were an 
undergraduate.

17:40.979 --> 17:49.453
Like one year I had two or three students in my 
history 105 and they decided they would try to

17:40.979 --> 17:49.453
kidnap every Southwest Conference mascot. Yeah, 
that was about the group of 1964. Something like

17:51.757 --> 17:54.221
that, yeah. I've got a friend who was in that class 
and he's told me about that. Oh dear. Did y'all, did

18:00.871 --> 18:08.083
you hear of any legendary pranks on a sophomore or a 
senior? Well, there was...

18:15.155 --> 18:35.833
I almost feel like I need to go off the record, but 
there was a classmate of mine, a good friend of

18:15.155 --> 18:35.833
mine, who lived in my dorm for about three years, 
who would go out before football weekends

18:15.155 --> 18:35.833
with his bow and arrow and would poach deer. He'd 
freeze them in the headlights And the coach would

18:38.168 --> 18:50.762
shoot him with a bow and arrow and dress, to clean 
him and dress him in the shower, drag him back to

18:38.168 --> 18:50.762
campus, clean him, dress him in the shower, cook 
him for outfit parties. Oh my. Now, was this in the

18:52.384 --> 18:56.069
Brazos County area where he killed the deer? Yeah. 
With a bow and arrow. Yeah, and he was a pretty

18:59.432 --> 19:02.696
legendary guy like that. Oh, I never heard that 
one. When we're not taping, I'll tell you more

19:04.966 --> 19:11.832
about it sometime. I can still remember that when I 
was in school, probably junior and senior year,

19:11.953 --> 19:31.891
there was a tendency toward making, in the dorm 
area, catapults using funnels with surgical

19:11.953 --> 19:31.891
tubing fixed through the tops of them. And then 
you'd make water balloons. stick them in the

19:34.463 --> 19:41.481
funnel and pull them back, and you'd fire water 
balloons across the quad at each other. And what

19:42.103 --> 19:44.690
was the container of the water? Just a funnel. No. 
Oh, just a funnel. A funnel. And you'd put a water

19:49.322 --> 19:50.886
balloon, and you'd fill it. put water in the 
balloon. Was that a true balloon? Oh yeah. Just

19:55.845 --> 20:02.776
fill the little balloon and then you stick them in a 
funnel, just a plain old plastic funnel like you

19:55.845 --> 20:02.776
can find anywhere. You have a couple people hold on 
to each end of the surgical tubing, pull the funnel

20:02.796 --> 20:08.845
back and let it fly. There were a lot of, back in the 
spring, there were a lot of water fights. Of course

20:14.173 --> 20:17.278
there was always the band the Corps versus the 
band. There was always all kinds of things going on

20:19.107 --> 20:24.413
between them. Let's see. Drownouts? Oh, yeah. 
Yeah. Oh, Babbo bombs? Yeah. Describe, as far as

20:30.841 --> 20:36.408
you know, describe the technology for Babbo 
bombing. Well, let me think. Basically, you get a,

20:38.491 --> 20:47.502
not a can, what do you call it, a container of Babbo 
take the top off, insert a cherry bomb in it, and

20:47.853 --> 20:59.263
with a fuse, if I remember right, put the can back 
on, light the fuse. All right, now was there still

20:59.283 --> 21:01.985
an airspace under doors at that point? There was a 
little bit, yeah. Okay, and then you'd roll it

21:03.446 --> 21:04.908
under there? You couldn't quite get it all the way 
under

21:05.768 --> 21:10.773
there. I remember there, we used to take, there was 
enough room between... between the door and the

21:17.587 --> 21:30.784
door jam, that you could take a baseball bat, split 
right down the middle, and jam the baseball bat

21:17.587 --> 21:30.784
between those, and somebody inside the room 
couldn't get out. That was used one time that I can

21:32.286 --> 21:37.673
recall. I guess the statute of limitations 
inspired on a lot of these things. One that I heard

21:41.778 --> 21:44.742
about was a roll of tea paper soaked in water. And I 
said, are you sure it was water? Yes, it was water.

21:48.991 --> 21:53.656
Then a babble bomb stuffed with paper and roll that 
under and blow it. Oh, you could do that in the

21:53.836 --> 21:57.280
toilets. The toilets had an air space. Oh, no. This 
was in the 40s. Oh, in the 40s. There was then a lot of

22:02.586 --> 22:03.868
air space. And then hot weather, window up, first 
floor room, sandbag is door. put the water hose in

22:13.375 --> 22:20.505
the window, turned on softly, and let the water get 
maybe a foot deep in the room. But the person said,

22:21.186 --> 22:28.816
we didn't realize when that door was open where 
that water was going to go down the hallway and who

22:21.186 --> 22:28.816
was going to have to clean it up. Yeah, yeah. I 
didn't ever know about any of those, but yeah. What

22:34.925 --> 22:42.035
about some good bull at football games or yell 
practices or anything? Do you remember anything?

22:46.703 --> 22:49.728
Or in class. I spent about 30 years just kind of 
blocking some of those things out.

23:02.969 --> 23:05.032
I'm kind of blanked on that. Also, one other thing 
that comes back to me is I remember Some of the guys

23:09.755 --> 23:19.070
in my outfit, they were sophomores, I guess, 
learned how to get around in the steam tunnels.

23:19.771 --> 23:21.875
Where did the steam tunnels go? Apparently all 
under the whole campus. If I remember right, there

23:25.020 --> 23:29.627
was a place that you could get in. I never went down 
there, but a couple of these guys did. You could go

23:33.313 --> 23:36.218
over by the biology building. It was a place that 
you could get down in there. And the steam tunnels

23:40.034 --> 23:43.177
went all underneath the dorm areas. And the idea 
was that you could, the idea was that ideally you

23:44.478 --> 23:55.731
could go down there, particularly under the band 
dorm, and find some way to get in there and you could

23:44.478 --> 23:55.731
work some mischief on the band of some type, I 
think. But I don't remember exactly, I don't think

23:55.751 --> 24:01.797
there was anything catastrophic that happened. 
But that's what happened to me. I had a lot of guys

24:02.798 --> 24:05.361
with a lot of time on their hands. How did your life 
change when you became a sophomore? What was

24:10.388 --> 24:13.853
different about being a sophomore? Well, the most 
immediate thing I remember is that my sophomore

24:14.093 --> 24:19.741
year, we moved. Our outfit was in the Sabisa area. 
They still had some core units over there. And the

24:24.968 --> 24:31.337
most immediate thing was that we had an 
air-conditioned dorm. So this would be the fall of

24:31.697 --> 24:33.219
60? 66. That area was air conditioned. My freshman 
year, the Duncan area was not air conditioned. So

24:44.553 --> 24:46.976
that made everything more tolerable.

24:49.960 --> 24:50.821
We parked over there. I had a parking place that 
wasn't as far away as the freshman. We used to call

24:54.947 --> 25:04.980
the freshman and sophomore lots the Hempstead and 
Avisota lot because they were down there near

24:54.947 --> 25:04.980
where the old bonfire field used to be. which in 
retrospect wasn't all that far, but it seemed

25:05.804 --> 25:09.732
long. But my sophomore year, it was a totally 
different orientation, on a different side of the

25:09.812 --> 25:15.724
campus. And you were over by Northgate, so you 
could always go over there and buy things if you

25:15.744 --> 25:19.552
needed to. There was shopping you could go to. And 
it was different for me because I changed my major

25:23.168 --> 25:26.253
to accounting. I nearly flunked out of starting 
out as an engineering major. And so I changed my

25:29.858 --> 25:32.962
major to accounting and did much better. So I 
always viewed my sophomore year as really a good

25:33.002 --> 25:36.628
year. Let's try to zero in now on some of the 
academic. When you came, you were planning to

25:40.534 --> 25:43.157
major in? Engineering. Engineering. And what 
courses helped you decide you didn't want to do

25:45.881 --> 25:49.927
engineering? Very simple. I didn't think I would 
be good at engineering, but my father had been one.

25:57.828 --> 25:59.169
I thought, well, I'll try it and see. In the spring 
semester of my freshman year, I was taking 18

26:00.110 --> 26:19.450
hours, which a lot of people did back then, and I 
made, on a three-point average, a three-point

26:00.110 --> 26:19.450
range, I made a 1.0, which doesn't sound too bad, 
but I still remember I made an A in PE, an A in

26:00.110 --> 26:19.450
military science, and an A in history. One of the 
six, I think it was. And then there may have been

26:22.925 --> 26:27.650
something else that I got some great points in. I 
think I made a C, perhaps, in engineering drawing.

26:34.539 --> 26:36.781
But then I had 12 other hours.

26:39.505 --> 26:44.931
Chemistry, I made a D. Physics and calculus, I made 
an F. So I decided right then that I didn't have an

26:45.586 --> 26:50.553
engineer's approach to things. So you switched to 
accounting? Switched to accounting. All right.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.882
And did that remain your major? Yes. I got my degree 
in accounting. Who were the key advisors,

26:59.825 --> 27:08.396
teachers, whether in accounting or not, that you 
now look back upon as being important? Sure. In the

27:09.237 --> 27:10.699
business school, Business school then was not 
nearly what it is now. It is an excellent school

27:15.488 --> 27:16.550
now. Then it was adequate, and they were working to 
make it better. There was Carlton Stowie, who is

27:22.259 --> 27:32.414
still on the accounting faculty, was a young 
accounting instructor, and I had him for one of the

27:22.259 --> 27:32.414
accounting classes. He was a good teacher. There 
was another young accounting professor, Alan

27:33.516 --> 27:40.146
Porter, who was a very good... professor and I 
remember learning quite a bit from him. I think

27:43.803 --> 28:07.500
without question the best professor I had in 
business school was a man named Bill Luker and I

27:43.803 --> 28:07.500
still remember that business students then had to 
take two semesters of statistics and the first

27:43.803 --> 28:07.500
semester I took in the spring of my sophomore year 
And I was a sophomore, and most of the other people

28:07.919 --> 28:12.124
in there were juniors and some seniors, I think. 
And statistics was something that came easy for

28:13.225 --> 28:17.471
me. I did very well in class. But Dr. Luker was so 
interested in students' learning that an amazing

28:19.073 --> 28:28.544
thing happened. When the fall semester of the next 
year came around and people were signing up for the

28:35.628 --> 28:42.762
for the second semester of statistics, he told us 
in advance what class he'd be teaching. And

28:42.782 --> 28:49.115
remarkably, virtually everyone who was in that 
other class signed up for his fall class. And he

28:49.676 --> 28:52.762
walked in, and here was almost the same seating 
chart. Everyone signed because he was a

28:52.802 --> 28:57.231
remarkably gifted teacher. There were several 
other teachers, particularly in the liberal arts

28:58.645 --> 29:03.831
area, that I enjoyed. I took several economics 
classes, excellent teachers. Who? Graham.

29:09.698 --> 29:14.783
Senator Graham had started teaching then in 
history. Dr. Calvin, I had him for 106, I believe.

29:18.588 --> 29:19.228
He's still there. Yeah, very good teacher, very 
good teacher. took some English classes that I

29:23.232 --> 29:25.315
enjoyed. And so while A&M is essentially a 
technology-oriented agriculture and

29:26.497 --> 29:43.264
engineering school, it was in the liberal arts 
area that I found several teachers who were very

29:26.497 --> 29:43.264
interesting that really gave me appreciation for 
those things. If you needed advice and

29:43.284 --> 29:46.810
counseling, to whom did you turn?

29:50.975 --> 29:54.320
I'm trying to think. Depending upon the time, 
well, I can tell you that the person that gave me a

29:55.322 --> 30:12.207
lot of advice

29:55.322 --> 30:12.207
when I was trying to decide about going to law 
school was Wayne Stark. I never was active in the

30:13.148 --> 30:18.535
MSC programs that Wayne had, but I knew him. I think 
somehow my parents had been down there one time and

30:18.655 --> 30:22.741
met him. He used to always hang out in the coffee 
shop at the MSC. I got to know him. He was always

30:28.969 --> 30:32.493
trying to get people to go to Harvard Law School. I 
don't think I was high octane enough for that, but

30:33.214 --> 30:41.906
he was very encouraging about those kinds of 
things. He was a particularly good man. Did you

30:43.237 --> 30:46.361
ever get the green couch treatment from him? No. Do 
you know what I'm talking about? I've heard that.

30:51.669 --> 30:53.772
But no, I didn't. All of my involvement with Mr. 
Stark was just in different discussions. I went on

31:00.662 --> 31:03.125
some of his MSC student leader trips. Oh, did you? 
Yeah. Describe. The one that I can particularly

31:05.849 --> 31:11.978
remember was when we were seniors when we went to 
Houston.

31:13.392 --> 31:24.060
He

31:13.392 --> 31:24.060
gave Aggies from College Station the opportunity 
to do things that probably most of us hadn't done

31:13.392 --> 31:24.060
before.
