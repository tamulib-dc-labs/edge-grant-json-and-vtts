WEBVTT

00:02.613 --> 00:31.590
If

00:02.613 --> 00:31.590
you've got a black officer out here and he gets 
involved in a scuffle with somebody and his

00:02.613 --> 00:31.590
matchstick slips and hits him across the forehead 
and they bleed like a stuffed pig,

00:02.613 --> 00:31.590
NAACP will not take or pursue a complaint of police 
brutality against a black officer. period.

00:37.621 --> 01:02.809
If it was a white officer

00:37.621 --> 01:02.809
involved in the same action,

00:37.621 --> 01:02.809
the NAACP and their

00:37.621 --> 01:02.809
representatives would scream to high heaven, 
build a corps, provide demonstration marches and

00:37.621 --> 01:02.809
the whole bit, trying to get this officer not only 
fired, But put my penitentiary.

01:11.348 --> 01:33.201
Your

01:11.348 --> 01:33.201
ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union, operates 
on the same theory that if a person's civil rights

01:11.348 --> 01:33.201
are violated, they will go to any extreme to 
guarantee that that person's civil rights and all

01:35.527 --> 01:49.422
of society's civil rights be guaranteed or 
punishment or retribution for a violation of

01:35.527 --> 01:49.422
them. But if it involves a policeman, they won't 
take a case defending a policeman or trying to

01:49.442 --> 02:00.133
improve his civil rights or guarantee that he even 
has a civil right.

02:05.227 --> 02:13.963
Reason being that

02:05.227 --> 02:13.963
they want issues that involve publicity. They 
want the publicity so that they can get the

02:15.165 --> 02:23.320
financial donations to perpetuate the ACLU. The 
cases involving the policemen don't generate any

02:25.404 --> 02:29.091
favorable publicity.

02:35.534 --> 02:40.800
Situations like that tend to make you hesitate 
doing your job. It

02:41.921 --> 02:50.430
gives you the attitude that people are going to get 
what they're doing to pay for it. You get cynical as

02:50.450 --> 02:51.511
hell.

02:56.076 --> 03:04.765
In the past, a policeman would be, as the 
understanding goes, involved in police action,

02:56.076 --> 03:04.765
take police action and solve a case or put an end to a 
disturbance at the scene. Now he writes a piece of

03:12.336 --> 03:29.019
paper and does

03:12.336 --> 03:29.019
nothing. A similar train of thought there. What 
kind of impact did affirmative action programs

03:33.145 --> 03:45.680
have for Fort Worth and the police department?

03:45.700 --> 03:49.825
Quite a bit.

03:49.845 --> 03:57.575
In hiring,

03:49.845 --> 03:57.575
the police department don't hire its people. All 
the city employees go through the personnel

03:57.595 --> 04:02.781
office. the city personnel office, and then are 
sent to where a vacancy exists. So every applicant

04:10.492 --> 04:31.063
has been pre-screened and pre-tested by the 
personnel office before you ever see them

04:10.492 --> 04:31.063
on the final job site or final employer or 
interview or whatever you want to call it. They

04:32.005 --> 04:38.533
send you a list of names, and you make your own 
appointments for them.

04:38.553 --> 04:47.063
You cannot accept or reject any of the applicants.

04:47.083 --> 04:51.909
You can tell the personnel office what you want, 
and they will notify you. The personnel office is

04:53.971 --> 05:01.320
not interested at all in who you hire, but they want 
to know a justifiable legal reason for everyone

05:02.465 --> 05:06.949
you turn down.

05:11.594 --> 05:18.941
And it better fit within the affirmative action 
rules.

05:18.981 --> 05:25.487
You can't say you're hiring this one because this 
one has more experience or this one will be a better

05:18.981 --> 05:25.487
employee. They want the reason for turning them 
down. Then give them down who you hire.

05:35.422 --> 05:44.753
Do you

05:35.422 --> 05:44.753
think it affects the effectiveness of the police 
department in the long run? If it affects the

05:45.714 --> 05:48.357
quality of your personnel, sure it does. And it 
does affect the quality of your personnel because

05:50.480 --> 06:04.737
instead of hiring ten people out here that are

05:50.480 --> 06:04.737
broad, well-rounded, physical, capable, people 
you hire three that are minorities simply because

06:05.543 --> 06:33.171
they are minorities and they fit in the category uh 
you give them special grades on all of their

06:05.543 --> 06:33.171
interviews so it's going to affect your overall 
effectiveness

06:05.543 --> 06:33.171
and this letter you mentioned uh You didn't give me 
a year, but I'm assuming it was late 60s, early 70s.

06:39.491 --> 06:41.974
You had an officer killed by a young black sniper. 
How does something like this affect the

06:44.196 --> 06:56.610
interactions you had with blacks on the street, or 
does it? It affected them real strong at that time.

07:03.340 --> 07:31.997
in the period of time between

07:03.340 --> 07:31.997
the incident when it occurred and the later 
apprehension of the sniper, I forget what the time

07:03.340 --> 07:31.997
was, a month, six weeks, we said what time,

07:03.340 --> 07:31.997
the police officers naturally take their own 
protection first

07:32.399 --> 07:59.858
and at the expense of appearance what i'm getting 
at is at say a traffic stop where you stop somebody

07:32.399 --> 07:59.858
running stop sign and you walk up to the car and ask 
to see if i have a license in preparation for

07:32.399 --> 07:59.858
writing them a ticket to run the stop sign at that 
time they'd walk up to the car carrying a loaded cop

07:32.399 --> 07:59.858
shotgun They wouldn't walk up with a pencil in 
their hand and a ticket book in the other. They'd

08:04.415 --> 08:07.118
walk up asking the driver's license with a shotgun 
in their hand. Yeah, it affects you, how you feel,

08:08.960 --> 08:21.593
how you act, because you don't know who you're 
talking

08:08.960 --> 08:21.593
to. What do you think the reaction is? Well, this is 
a hypothetical question. What kind of reaction do

08:27.985 --> 08:38.518
you think it would have been if instead of a black 
guy it had been a drugged out hippie? Would that

08:38.538 --> 08:40.881
have changed the way the force reacted? At that 
time, there was no such thing as a drugged out

08:40.901 --> 08:46.188
hippie. That came later.

08:52.395 --> 08:57.081
It was prior to the drug culture. Okay, I'm trying 
to aim that question. If it had just been a, oh,

09:02.793 --> 09:06.859
okay. What I'm trying to get at is if it had been a 
white or an Asian, if it had been somebody else,

09:06.879 --> 09:17.296
would that have affected the same way? I mean, with 
tension, with anything like that, do tensions

09:17.316 --> 09:22.344
rise regardless of who it is? I mean, look, to give 
you an example, Several years later, this would be

09:27.892 --> 09:33.962
approximately 10 years ago. It would be about 76, I 
imagine. We had an incident on the west side where

09:36.686 --> 09:43.417
we had a black walking down the street shooting a 
pistol. Broad daylight.

09:49.246 --> 09:51.910
Two cars were sent, both of them one-man cars. One 
officer pulled up. He knew the Black. He was a

09:57.098 --> 09:58.139
middle case. He knew him. He had talked with him 
before. Instead of waiting for his backup unit to

10:02.984 --> 10:08.829
get there, he called for him to come over and sit in 
the car. The man did.

10:14.394 --> 10:16.296
What happened in that car, I don't know. Nobody 
ever knows for sure, but we're guessing.

10:22.302 --> 10:23.363
The pistol The black was carrying mud off and 
killed the policeman. He was white. He was a

10:31.288 --> 10:38.697
policeman with about 28 years experience.

10:42.382 --> 10:48.490
When the other car got there, which was less than 
two or three blocks away at the time,

10:51.406 --> 10:59.258
The black jumped out of the car and ran to the other 
car, hollering for help, because this officer had

10:51.406 --> 10:59.258
been shot. There was no department-wide hard 
feelings toward blacks incident.

11:11.095 --> 11:13.899
There was no big public sentiment for or against. 
It was a policeman that had, for some

11:14.901 --> 11:21.210
reason, had violated departmental policy in that 
he hadn't waited for it back up yet to get there with

11:22.118 --> 11:30.108
him. The black was a middle case. Been in and out of 
the hospital a number of times. But Jesse knew it.

11:39.900 --> 11:43.605
He'd talk with him, knew his nickname, where he 
lived. His habit was getting out in the backyard,

11:43.625 --> 11:49.212
shoot that pistol up in the air till it was empty, 
and then go back in the house. He did this every

11:50.614 --> 11:51.535
week. And Jesse was. But when Jesse was killed, 
there wasn't any big set society, the department,

11:56.272 --> 12:08.403
the individual going to the department was upset 
about it. Why the difference between the two

12:08.423 --> 12:11.346
incidents? Why the difference in the reaction? 
One was a deliberate,

12:13.708 --> 12:19.814
planned incident. The other was an unavoidable 
accident.

12:29.872 --> 12:35.718
Early on in your career, you work in Youth Division 
1. What did this job involve? In Texas,

12:39.982 --> 12:53.335
children under the age of 10 are not deemed

12:39.982 --> 12:53.335
capable of making a legal decision.

12:56.638 --> 12:59.541
Juveniles from the age of 10 to 17 are and can be held 
responsible for their actions. Any offense that

13:06.644 --> 13:24.808
they commit either against themselves or against 
society

13:06.644 --> 13:24.808
was handled by the youth police.

13:24.828 --> 13:25.849
We also handled Registration of bicycles. 
Licensing bicycles at that time were not anymore.

13:35.601 --> 13:36.141
Runaways. This type of

13:37.944 --> 13:44.493
service. Thanks. Well, I guess now I'm going to get 
asked, what was the most common thing? It handled a

13:51.282 --> 13:53.104
diversity. In the youth division? Shoplifting, 
theft, and runaways. What age, or what's the most

14:00.423 --> 14:10.338
common age for, you know, describe a typical 
problem you face? It's hard to describe typical.

14:17.408 --> 14:19.731
Eleven-year-old white boy pimping two girls. One 
eleven, one twelve. Is he typical?

14:26.849 --> 14:33.035
Or the boy that gets a bad report about the first six 
weeks of school, don't want to go home, so he's

14:26.849 --> 14:33.035
turned into a runaway.

14:36.318 --> 14:46.789
The kid that got a bicycle for Christmas, he can't 
get out riding it without a registration or a

14:36.318 --> 14:46.789
license tag on it, because he don't know the 
difference. This one's typical. A girl that goes

14:50.713 --> 14:56.839
to the store and shoplifts a tube of lipstick, 
because she don't have one that color.

15:03.755 --> 15:11.346
How would you say the kids

15:03.755 --> 15:11.346
today compare to the kids that you work with then? 
Think they're pretty much the same? I think the

15:15.412 --> 15:21.221
drug influence has made a lot of change. I don't 
know what happened in that field. I can't say, but

15:24.906 --> 15:29.273
I'm afraid that it has. Like what? more than taking 
drugs, experimenting with drugs,

15:31.919 --> 15:53.064
committing offenses to get money to buy drugs,

15:31.919 --> 15:53.064
being on drugs and under the effect of them. The 
main thing we had then that could be considered

15:53.184 --> 16:00.373
drugs would be alcohol or hallucinations. if it's 
kept up will kill you. Alcohol, if it's kept up for

16:05.746 --> 16:10.111
an extreme will kill you. But not to the extent that 
drugs

16:10.131 --> 16:21.124
are used now. Okay. Ah,

16:21.665 --> 16:25.990
here's the one we were talking about earlier. In 
1966, the Supreme Court ruled in the Randy case

16:26.628 --> 16:33.317
that a suspect has to be informed of their rights 
when they're arrested. About the same time, they

16:34.738 --> 16:44.070
ruled in the Mapp case that you can't have legal 
search warrant that specifies what you're after.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.636
How do these rulings affect your work?

16:56.598 --> 17:22.588
of the effect if you are a patrol officer and

16:56.598 --> 17:22.588
you are patrolling out here on the midnight shift 
and you see a car go by with two people sitting in it

16:56.598 --> 17:22.588
the back end nearly dragging the ground driving 
down the street obeying every traffic law you can

16:56.598 --> 17:22.588
think of Why would you want to stop that car?

17:33.442 --> 17:37.627
Because that son of a bitch carried something 
stolen in the back end of that thing. Otherwise, he

17:37.647 --> 17:39.950
wouldn't be dragging the bottom like that. How are 
you going to justify searching the back end of that

17:39.970 --> 17:44.095
car to see what he stole? Yes, it affects your work.

17:51.243 --> 17:53.706
You've got to find him in some kind of a violation. 
strong enough where you can put him in jail over a

17:54.614 --> 18:15.393
lieutenant's objection to give you the right to 
search that car under the guise of being

17:54.614 --> 18:15.393
inventorying the property of the car before you

17:54.614 --> 18:15.393
put it in the PD panel.

18:21.338 --> 18:21.479
Yeah. Do you think... Take your average policeman 
or you. Do you think that things like the Miranda

18:26.311 --> 18:42.769
warning and the restrictions on searches, do you 
think those are good in the fact that they may

18:26.311 --> 18:42.769
protect an individual or bad in the fact that they 
may hinder enforcement? They hinder

18:44.531 --> 18:50.558
enforcement.

18:56.073 --> 19:13.992
I don't agree with the theory that society should 
be burdened with the expense of furnishing a

18:56.073 --> 19:13.992
high-priced lawyer to somebody that has been 
charged with committing an offense. I don't think

19:16.395 --> 19:25.725
that's society's burden.

19:26.515 --> 19:39.492
I don't necessarily agree with the idea that he 
should be told everything that he says can and may

19:26.515 --> 19:39.492
be used against

19:26.515 --> 19:39.492
him. By law, he should be a grown man and he should be 
held accountable for his actions, period.

19:48.384 --> 19:55.594
I

19:48.384 --> 19:55.594
don't agree with the requirement for a warrant.

19:58.358 --> 20:28.365
If

19:58.358 --> 20:28.365
you had stolen a pencil from the library by 
accident,

19:58.358 --> 20:28.365
just put it in your pocket without even thinking 
that it might be yours or it might be somebody

19:58.358 --> 20:28.365
else's left laying on the table there, and a police 
officer stops you at the door and starts with all

19:58.358 --> 20:28.365
this warning,

19:58.358 --> 20:28.365
what are you going to tell them? He ain't going to 
listen to nothing until he gets you to jail. The

20:33.323 --> 20:35.606
jail lieutenant tells you the same thing again.

20:38.550 --> 20:45.579
And the jail lieutenant ain't going to say nothing 
until he gets the corporation court judge down

20:38.550 --> 20:45.579
there and he gives you the warning again.

20:48.502 --> 20:51.045
By that time, you're a little bit pissed off about 
that damn pencil. And then the next day, when the

20:53.268 --> 20:57.053
detective gets you out to ask you about what caused 
the offense to you being in the jail, and he gives

20:59.362 --> 21:10.861
you the warning and writes it down again on what 
time you were given the warning by who, are you

20:59.362 --> 21:10.861
going to be eager to tell him? I don't think so. 
Yeah, it hinders law or justice.

21:29.602 --> 21:35.949
How does a hindrance balance out with any possible 
benefit? Can you name me one benefit? What's

21:42.196 --> 21:47.621
stated a lot is it protects the individual from... 
Anything

21:48.622 --> 21:58.393
you say can and may be used against you. If you are 
unable to obtain an attorney of your choice, an

21:59.875 --> 22:07.523
attorney will be furnished. I don't agree with any 
one of those. What about the search restrictions?

22:19.054 --> 22:20.396
That's a different one altogether.

22:24.540 --> 22:27.823
The Constitution of the United States comes along 
there under one of the laws or one of the

22:28.917 --> 22:43.836
amendments, that you shall be secure in your 
person against all unreasonable searches or

22:28.917 --> 22:43.836
seizures. The word that brings into question is 
unreasonable. If it's a reasonable search or a

22:49.463 --> 22:57.253
reasonable seizure, I believe it should be 
ineffective.

23:00.575 --> 23:18.812
Just like I pointed out a while ago, if you've got a 
car going down the street at 2.30 in the morning,

23:00.575 --> 23:18.812
two old boys sitting in the front end of it, and the 
back end of it dragging the ground,

23:00.575 --> 23:18.812
I believe you've got cause for reasonable search 
for that vehicle. But as things stand today, no

23:20.613 --> 23:26.559
court in the land would oppose

23:20.613 --> 23:26.559
it. Reasonable seems to be pretty subjective. It 
is. How can you establish something that could be

23:29.870 --> 23:33.735
consistent? I'm not a lawyer. I can't. All I can 
tell you is what's reasonable in my way of thinking

23:40.384 --> 23:47.013
and why I think that. And if by virtue of being a 
policeman on the beat for 12 years, 5 years, or 20

23:47.033 --> 23:57.767
years, you have a reasonable cause to believe that 
a stolen TV is in the back end of that car.

24:03.974 --> 24:08.861
Or that a motor from another car is stuck in the back 
end of that. That should be grabbed for stopping

24:08.881 --> 24:15.650
and

24:08.881 --> 24:15.650
searching. You're not accusing the people of 
anything until you find something that is out of

24:15.670 --> 24:23.260
line. And then I believe it becomes incumbent on 
them to prove that

24:28.747 --> 24:36.378
they're not. When did the Fort Worth Police 
Department start making you read Miranda

24:36.398 --> 24:48.355
and restricting your activities and searches?

24:54.043 --> 24:55.665
I couldn't even say I don't even know. Well, the 
court started in 66. I'm just curious how long it

25:00.096 --> 25:02.919
took to put it. You came to work one day and they 
said, all right, this is what we're going to do. Oh,

25:07.824 --> 25:07.964
no. It would be a gradual buildup and an 
overreaction to whatever the actual decision

25:08.485 --> 25:18.635
was. It always is.

25:22.659 --> 25:26.243
They overreact to it in such a way as to protect 
themselves. Then as the decision comes out and

25:27.353 --> 25:49.305
becomes more understood, more widely read, then 
adjustments are made to ease the restrictions

25:27.353 --> 25:49.305
that you've been placed under.

25:49.325 --> 25:50.086
Okay. Let's see. We may have already discussed 
this. We'll try again. The rights of the accused

25:55.552 --> 26:05.766
are very strong in the U.S. Miranda, right to 
counsel, tendency of judges to throw out cases on

25:55.552 --> 26:05.766
technicalities.

26:10.593 --> 26:13.177
How much more difficult do these make police work?

26:17.763 --> 26:20.347
It makes the police work a lot more difficult.

26:23.191 --> 26:24.833
It increases the paperwork.

26:28.711 --> 26:35.019
No, I didn't say how

26:28.711 --> 26:35.019
much. And it reduces

26:35.039 --> 26:46.875
the amount of police work because so much time has 
to be spent on paperwork justifying what you did.

26:48.657 --> 26:57.469
Or explaining that you went right down the line at 
8.05, at 8.06, at 8.08. So will my fish.

27:05.230 --> 27:07.452
Can you give an example? Yeah, any examples? I 
mean, out of your own experience or just thinking

27:10.155 --> 27:14.939
of it? Either good or bad, of increased awareness 
for the individual and the responsibility of the

27:14.960 --> 27:27.051
police to recognize and respect, at least in the 
court's opinion, Yeah, that was a bad question.

27:33.087 --> 27:48.393
Any example, can you give any examples from your 
own experience of the effects of these, either

27:33.087 --> 27:48.393
good or bad effects of other, you've already given 
some, so this is kind of a repetitious question.

27:53.441 --> 27:54.102
Well,

27:57.743 --> 28:22.485
When I was assigned to the Texas office burglary 
section, well before any of this

27:57.743 --> 28:22.485
had come into being,

27:57.743 --> 28:22.485
at that time we had approximately

28:25.283 --> 28:43.410
a 25% clearance rate of all burglaries that were 
reported, with about a 19% recovery of all

28:25.283 --> 28:43.410
burglary losses.

28:43.430 --> 28:52.244
I'm

28:43.430 --> 28:52.244
not thoroughly familiar with what the 
percentages would be now. I doubt they would be

28:52.504 --> 28:54.447
anywhere near there.

28:57.886 --> 29:25.812
And I believe it's

28:57.886 --> 29:25.812
almost strictly

28:57.886 --> 29:25.812
attributable to the fact

28:57.886 --> 29:25.812
that so much more extensive paperwork is required 
that

28:57.886 --> 29:25.812
less cases can be worked by the detective. He has 
less time. If one case takes him two or three days

29:29.358 --> 29:49.358
paperwork,

29:29.358 --> 29:49.358
and he's getting five or six cases assigned to him a 
day, something's gotta slide.

30:00.678 --> 30:06.664
What was the perception of the policeman of the 
flower children? I don't know if you want to

30:07.585 --> 30:14.132
distinguish between flower children and hippies 
or whether you get all the same. Were they a minor

30:14.152 --> 30:23.302
problem or was it...

30:23.322 --> 30:24.643
Try to think back now. We didn't have any...

30:33.955 --> 30:36.577
First, we had our black minority groups.

30:39.140 --> 30:43.864
And while they were gone, we had what we more or less 
called the flower children. They were

30:43.884 --> 30:48.569
groups.

30:52.773 --> 30:59.459
And then later on came what would be termed 
hippies.

31:00.680 --> 31:02.562
There were more or less several years in between.

31:05.613 --> 31:17.580
The Flower Children, they

31:05.613 --> 31:17.580
formed groups.
