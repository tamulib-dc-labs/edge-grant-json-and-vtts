WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:07.396
praise and changes and so forth. You mentioned as 
key positive decisions to admit women and racial

00:07.596 --> 00:23.115
integration, non-compulsory core, broaden more 
graduate programs and so forth.

00:25.118 --> 00:32.046
Let's continue to talk about any advice that you 
would offer to anyone today who's looking toward

00:25.118 --> 00:32.046
the future. of how to make A&M even better.

00:49.086 --> 00:54.130
I think we've got to get a handle on some things. 
Hazing, for instance, I think it's got to be wiped

00:54.931 --> 00:59.856
out.

01:03.785 --> 01:19.286
got to try to erase the lingering image of a 
college, which I'm afraid still exists

01:03.785 --> 01:19.286
to some degree. During your days as faculty 
member, were you aware of much hazing going on? It

01:27.297 --> 01:29.120
crept up, yes. Yes, I realized it did occur. Did 
students ever, freshmen particularly, come to

01:34.919 --> 01:41.869
your office and share with you their feelings 
about being in the Corps? It's rather strange, I

01:43.671 --> 01:46.915
think. I had a few who would come, close the door, 
burst into tears, say, I like A&M, but I don't like

01:46.936 --> 01:56.669
the Corps, and so therefore I'm going to have to 
leave because the Corps is just not for me. Let's

01:58.652 --> 01:59.132
see. Trying to make an answer. What should A&M 
aspire to be today? Should it aspire to be one of the

02:09.155 --> 02:14.843
key top public institutions in the country?

02:19.810 --> 02:23.755
Yes, I think it should.

02:24.816 --> 02:28.281
You mentioned fine arts as an area to be added. Do 
you think of any other academic areas that you

02:28.632 --> 02:33.858
think A&M ought to add?

02:39.985 --> 02:40.866
No, I don't believe so.

02:46.171 --> 02:53.780
The last I knew, we could not qualify for a 5A 
chapter.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.741
Is that still true? I don't know. I was, back in the 
70s, I was part of the group that welcomed, and we

02:55.868 --> 03:21.792
had been set up because the three visitors were 
spinster women from comparatively small Eastern

02:55.868 --> 03:21.792
all-female institutions, and they had been fed 
information that led them to believe that every

02:55.868 --> 03:21.792
one of us was a hard-nosed male chauvinist 
so-and-so. And I can't help but believe that we

03:23.712 --> 03:34.766
deserve Phi Beta Kappa as well as Baylor or TCU or 
Trinity. I'm not at all knocking them. But I think

03:36.949 --> 03:40.714
we have the quality to equal those. But I wish we 
could do that because I think that would be a very

03:41.475 --> 03:45.440
good signal. I think the addition of the fine arts 
would help that a great deal. Matter of fact, Paul

03:50.607 --> 03:53.230
Parrish in the English department is working on 
that very thing. On 5-8? Well, not 5-8. He's trying

03:59.036 --> 04:12.269
to work out a fine arts program, a combination of 
theater and music.

04:12.289 --> 04:12.850
All right, let's see. We're getting close to the 
end. Do you have any Aggie stories, whether they be

04:16.534 --> 04:20.938
true or not, Aggie stories that you enjoy passing 
on? Well, I've been thinking about that, but I

04:27.452 --> 04:31.176
haven't come up with any. I came up with some 
faculty member stories. Well, those are good.

04:35.882 --> 04:50.959
Well, one that a couple of them used to be involved, 
the same person we had, a young fellow, came in

04:35.882 --> 04:50.959
1946, just graduated from the University of 
Illinois, named Dude Huck, and Abel Huck, Abel

04:35.882 --> 04:50.959
Dude Huck, How do you spell Hubka? H-U-B-K-A. And 
Dr. Mayo was very fond of him. He treated him like a

04:57.911 --> 05:05.647
son, both from the affection end and the raving 
mouth end when he needed it, but he was a real pricey

04:57.911 --> 05:05.647
little rascal. At any rate, they invited us over 
for dinner one night, so when we got there, his

05:05.667 --> 05:11.479
wife, me, and then big pot of boiling water on the 
stove, and Dude was out with his shotgun, going to

05:11.830 --> 05:20.799
shoot the game for the entree. He came back with a 
dove and a woodpecker.

05:26.985 --> 05:35.974
I'm sure they had other things, but the entree, 
Martin and I each got a bite of dove, and Dude and his

05:26.985 --> 05:35.974
wife shared the woodpecker. Another story on the 
same guy. He was teaching a sophomore literature

05:39.387 --> 05:49.522
class in our English 203, and he was teaching the 
play that's based on the Sacco-Vanzetti case. The

05:49.562 --> 05:53.928
name of the play escapes me at the moment, but at any 
rate, that's what he was teaching. Well, also in

05:53.988 --> 06:08.770
the department was Colonel Kane, a very urbane, 
sophisticated, articulate, retired army man,

05:53.988 --> 06:08.770
and he made a study of the Sacco-Vanzetti case, So, 
Lepke invited him to come talk to the class about

06:09.273 --> 06:12.517
it. So, when they got there, he said, this was 
Colonel Kane, he's a retired military, and he's

06:12.557 --> 06:24.733
made a study of the Sacro Donzetti case. Sure, this 
will be a very interesting talk. I wish I could stay

06:26.936 --> 06:31.722
to hear it.

06:31.742 --> 06:32.302
Took off. Then there was, in that same 46, there was 
an old gentleman named Mr. Childs, And we were all

06:39.766 --> 06:42.350
hired sight unseen. They were desperate to meet 
those classes with the veterans flocking in.

06:49.040 --> 06:54.909
Anyway, Mr. Childs came with good credentials, 
but he wasn't too far off. We were at some

06:55.009 --> 06:57.112
gathering. He discovered that Frank Pierce was a 
speech teacher. He was talking to him. He said, do

07:01.599 --> 07:06.506
you know the work of Robinson?

07:06.526 --> 07:07.748
I said, no, I don't believe I do. All the rest of the 
evening, Mr. Childs went around by there, teach

07:09.010 --> 07:15.118
his speech, doesn't know Robinson. Teach his 
speech, doesn't know Robinson. Well, Frank went

07:18.322 --> 07:24.270
to him at the end of the, he said, Mr. Childs, he 
said, tell me who this Robinson is. He said, if

07:24.290 --> 07:33.482
somebody I should know, I wouldn't

07:24.290 --> 07:33.482
know. Childs said, Robinson? Robinson? I don't 
know any Robinson.

07:38.963 --> 07:48.512
Did any student or anyone ever tease you about 
being from Illinois, not being local, not being a

07:38.963 --> 07:48.512
Texan? Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. I got that. I get called a 
Yankee every now and then. I remember one early

07:53.457 --> 07:57.742
teacher evaluation. I don't know actually what 
the student meant. He said he wants to impress his

07:59.563 --> 08:05.850
Yankee ideas.

08:06.310 --> 08:08.312
Did they ever think? indicate they thought you 
were liberal or conservative or anything like

08:08.697 --> 08:12.284
that?

08:16.091 --> 08:25.109
Oh yeah, we had a few essays here and there that 
touched

08:16.091 --> 08:25.109
upon liberal issues. I think they can see that I 
endorsed them more or less. Let's see, any sad,

08:32.862 --> 08:40.650
poignant stories, recollections, experiences?

08:46.337 --> 08:54.625
Oh, well,

08:46.337 --> 08:54.625
we had deaths in our department. We had two young 
men, obviously, people killed and all that kind of

08:54.645 --> 09:00.692
stuff. Kirkus Little was one of

09:01.162 --> 09:12.493
them.

09:12.513 --> 09:14.575
How did the department handle that? Well, 
everybody grieved, of course, and we contacted

09:16.337 --> 09:27.468
their families and flowers to the funeral. The 
things you do was rather devastating to us.

09:33.207 --> 09:36.371
The other young man was killed on Labor Day at 
Plannersville. He had a convention with a number

09:36.391 --> 09:40.097
of students. It was a big shock for them. As a matter 
of fact, I come to think about it, I didn't. Those

09:47.146 --> 09:50.451
students didn't come to talk to me. I did what I 
could to try to get the man away. Now, were you and

09:55.177 --> 10:02.067
the women in your life, were you all Presbyterians 
early on here? Here we were, I grew up a Baptist, and

10:03.413 --> 10:16.345
when we went to my first teaching job, we went from 
town, which there was no Baptist church, probably

10:03.413 --> 10:16.345
wouldn't have sampled it had there been. So I went 
with Margaret and fell in love with the church.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.711
When you moved here, which church did you join? We 
went to, we joined in Pride. It was much closer to,

10:26.134 --> 10:28.736
see, we were at the field. It was much closer, and we 
liked it very much. In the late 40s, early 50s, what

10:34.733 --> 10:42.925
was the relationship between Bryan and College 
Station? When y'all first moved here, there

10:43.445 --> 10:47.451
wasn't a good grocery store in College Station. 
Where'd y'all do your shopping? Well, we went to

10:49.374 --> 10:51.437
Bryan. Actually, there were a couple of stores. 
There was Charlie's at the North Gate,

10:54.561 --> 11:04.555
and Manning Smith had a grocery store over there. 
There was something called the Knife Depot and

11:05.767 --> 11:12.918
travel agencies off of Walton. And I might have met 
that grocery store there. What was there right

11:15.803 --> 11:20.550
here to the north and west toward the railroad on 
Jersey? Was Maidly's Pharmacy there yet? Yeah,

11:23.014 --> 11:24.897
Maidly's was there, yeah. For those that don't 
remember, Maidly's described that. Well, yeah.

11:32.243 --> 11:35.849
It was a good old-fashioned drugstore that had all 
the stuff. It was sort of fun and served

11:35.969 --> 11:38.894
sandwiches. A lot of people dropped in there for 
lunch. Everybody knew Mr. Badly to hang out for the

11:42.480 --> 11:44.403
kids. Let the kids come in after school and drink 
their folks and sit around and talk. It was quite an

11:52.397 --> 11:56.223
institution which a lot of us still miss. What else 
was there along there? I believe Brewers was, and

11:59.969 --> 12:03.532
maybe the Cleaners. No alcohol in Brazos County 
then? Went across Whiskey Bridge. And that went

12:13.121 --> 12:15.163
way back, didn't it?

12:18.106 --> 12:18.206
Yes. Did you and your family have any interaction 
with the students living in the project houses?

12:27.395 --> 12:29.537
No, the project houses We were sort of on our way 
out, I believe, if I recall correctly, but we did

12:30.850 --> 12:39.799
not have. Let's see, we talked about coaches.

12:46.447 --> 13:00.081
Okay, let's, as we're really getting close to the 
end, let's make believe that someone walks up to

12:46.447 --> 13:00.081
you now and gives you a check worth at least 
hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more than

12:46.447 --> 13:00.081
that, And the only restriction to that gift is you 
must pass it on to Texas A&M, but you can decide the

13:01.040 --> 13:14.001
use or uses to which that money would be put. What 
would you give, if you had lots of money to give away

13:15.123 --> 13:19.610
to A&M, what would you give it for? What are your pet 
projects?

13:29.390 --> 13:36.279
The strange thing to be dumb and saddled about is, 
well, certainly not bricks and mortar. I

13:38.241 --> 13:49.095
certainly think I'd be interested in giving the 
library some additional help, and I think that I

13:38.241 --> 13:49.095
would probably want to give some of it to the 
College of Liberal Arts. Is there any special

13:51.618 --> 13:54.402
subject area in the library? I really don't know 
what the status of that collection is, but that

13:56.187 --> 14:16.238
would be a special area depending on what they 
found that really needed or what they asked for.

14:24.335 --> 14:31.602
I might want to do something for Opus.

14:31.622 --> 14:34.505
Possibly the Memorial Student Center. I 
certainly want to direct all of it where it

14:35.345 --> 14:41.391
benefits people. I suppose what I actually would 
do is do some research. Find out where needs are and

14:47.057 --> 14:52.722
what some of those areas actually want and 
actually need. right let me conclude then by

14:54.068 --> 15:17.933
thanking you very much and by reminding you if you 
have any papers personal papers reminiscences or

14:54.068 --> 15:17.933
any sort about the A&M years that you'd be willing 
for the archives to copy please do so because we

14:54.068 --> 15:17.933
need as many actual personal items as possible. 
Well actually I've pretty well read that stuff.

15:28.365 --> 15:41.727
Say that what I wish more than anything else would 
be the letters that students wrote home because

15:28.365 --> 15:41.727
there they were usually very confidential and 
very honest about what was happening and who was

15:28.365 --> 15:41.727
helping them. I had to vacate my office a short time 
ago. That was quite a job. I gave most of them to the

15:49.497 --> 15:53.162
graduate students. I just put them out and have 
them. I brought home my collections,

15:57.689 --> 16:03.939
you know, my full set of Google tickets. I gave the 
full set of Twain to my daughter. Good. Well, let me

16:09.668 --> 16:11.190
thank you very much. What is that?
