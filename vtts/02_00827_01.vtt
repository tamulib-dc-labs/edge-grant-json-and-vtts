WEBVTT

00:01.786 --> 00:10.156
This is Terry Hanger, and I'm interviewing WC 
Daniel Jr. from the Daniel Funeral Home here in

00:01.786 --> 00:10.156
Bryan, Texas.

00:23.331 --> 00:27.456
Born in the Boonville area. This day is known as 
Route 3, Bryant. That was in February of 1927.

00:38.967 --> 00:50.438
I don't know anything about the Boonville area 
because when I found myself, I was in Bryant at 409

00:38.967 --> 00:50.438
West 19th

00:38.967 --> 00:50.438
Street. That's all I remember, of course, with 
Francis Boonville in front. Since that time both

00:55.550 --> 01:05.304
my parents have died, I've gotten good school, and 
I got married. And that's just about

01:05.324 --> 01:14.278
the gist of my whole life. Now, there are a few folks 
here from Danville. There's, uh, I can remember

01:20.006 --> 01:22.570
Jack Cannon, that dude was a man of years.

01:27.292 --> 01:43.070
But

01:27.292 --> 01:43.070
most of the old things have passed

01:27.292 --> 01:43.070
on now that I still remember. Well, do you know 
where your family came from before they were at

01:43.090 --> 01:45.072
Booneville? My father? Yes. I don't. I think I know 
his parents were in Alabama.

02:01.177 --> 02:10.270
My mother was from Hearns,

02:01.177 --> 02:10.270
throughout the county. She taught school. He was a 
minister and a mortician. Good Lord, did he get the

02:20.184 --> 02:27.775
salary that he needed to stay

02:20.184 --> 02:27.775
away from the morticians. I graduated from 
Southern University in 1947. I did further study

02:36.531 --> 02:42.779
at Texas Southern University in Houston. I 
graduated from the Pomeroy College of Motor

02:42.799 --> 02:46.403
Science in 1948. I took the board in 48. I took my 
apprenticeship under my father at the old

02:48.626 --> 02:57.357
Anglican Home at 700 North Sterling. Of course,

02:59.395 --> 03:09.690
after he passed, I built my own theater. I married 
Mrs. She was a lioness. She was a Miss Lioness

03:10.652 --> 03:14.157
Hospital at that time. That's from the first town 
in the Wilcox

03:14.177 --> 03:23.751
community. She's got a presence of teaching the 
blind public schools.

03:34.141 --> 03:37.105
Well, can you tell me, do you know anything about, 
like, the farming? When you were in Boonesville,

03:37.125 --> 03:40.330
was there farming around in that area? Yeah, 
Boonesville was another first farm around. Can

03:43.094 --> 03:51.225
you tell me, like, any new things that you have seen 
in your lifetime, you know, that have progressed

03:43.094 --> 03:51.225
the way the old farming practices were? Oh, yes, I 
see. You know, we've gotten the way everything is

03:52.727 --> 03:56.993
mechanized now. Of course, most of the folk that 
were there during my time, They don't. I mean, they

04:02.843 --> 04:03.423
moved. Those that left, they moved away. None of 
the children are there anymore.

04:13.116 --> 04:13.957
They moved away. Well, now you know how the 
children are. They grew up. They want something.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.182
They got to have a bright life. Some noise, anyway. 
There's nothing else. So now they're going to be

04:24.190 --> 04:26.914
the rural areas. Because I think I understand 
there's a trend back to it. How have I got to see it?

04:31.533 --> 04:34.657
When you first moved to Bryan, it wasn't this 
developed. Oh no, Bryan was nothing like it is

04:34.678 --> 04:37.802
today. Bryan wasn't even a city at that time. Can 
you just tell me, you know, a few little things that

04:39.404 --> 04:43.110
you remember the way it was?

04:47.155 --> 04:48.978
Well... I heard something that there used to be a 
lot of saloons on. ministry or something? Well, I

04:56.640 --> 04:58.162
don't know. They've had no mouth in here. Oh, 
really? Now, they get more progress than

04:59.464 --> 05:15.384
anything, but we have grown to manage this thing 
from a one-horse town to a two-horse town now. I

05:15.404 --> 05:16.305
promise I'm safe. Well, what do you think is 
causing it? Do you think it was the university or

05:19.796 --> 05:25.221
it's just the railroad or the airport? No, I have to 
attribute it to the university because the

05:25.862 --> 05:37.072
railroad

05:25.862 --> 05:37.072
didn't do that much of anything. I have to 
attribute all the progress to the university. I

05:40.175 --> 05:43.599
don't know if it would have been for the 
university. At that time, you could... Let's get

05:43.619 --> 05:47.322
my phone in the sun. Hello. Yes, I have a copy from

05:50.106 --> 05:56.588
the college. My brother's here.

06:01.207 --> 06:07.896
Oh,

06:01.207 --> 06:07.896
well, you're talking about college now? You 
attribute most of the development to college? As a

06:11.461 --> 06:13.023
result of college being bad. Well, I heard 
something that there used to be like a trolley car

06:13.444 --> 06:17.549
or something that went from Brian to... Yes, there 
was. I don't remember, but I'm saying there was a

06:18.170 --> 06:24.719
trolley car system here. I do know one thing. That 
was... watering trough for cattle in the middle of

06:29.759 --> 06:32.947
Main Street. You might remember that. Everybody 
wanted to get it moved. It never did move. My mother

06:38.560 --> 06:40.805
ran over it. It was your mother then, huh? She never 
tried to

06:48.743 --> 06:50.906
I don't know what that was. Most likely it was a 
scar. My dad used to leave him that scar. I don't

06:58.416 --> 07:07.408
remember whether it was

06:58.416 --> 07:07.408
that or not. But most likely he would have had a scar 
because that's what he used to have all the time. I

07:14.878 --> 07:15.759
don't remember whether it was that or not. What 
about, do you know of any like influential

07:18.511 --> 07:23.820
families that have helped out with growing and 
development? Yes.

07:28.588 --> 07:34.057
It's kind of like the history now.

07:34.077 --> 07:39.526
The history books when we were in college and 
things like Lincoln and Washington, they forget

07:34.077 --> 07:39.526
about George Washington. Here we had, there was a 
doctor here named

07:52.193 --> 08:00.082
Dr. Mason, Dr. Allen, but even before that, there 
was another very good doctor, Thompson, Dr. A. E.

07:52.193 --> 08:00.082
Thompson. He was a great asset to this town.

08:09.413 --> 08:10.895
Looks like he's passed on now. I'm going to tell you 
how many years he's passed on now. But when you say

08:17.823 --> 08:20.145
flu, H-R-B, flu, ain't it hard to put it? When you 
say flu, H-R-B. your

08:23.395 --> 08:43.119
interpretation

08:23.395 --> 08:43.119
of the information that we left in from mine, see, 
well, you would see Mick Dansby. I would perhaps

08:43.139 --> 08:45.902
see Dave C. Dansby. Mm-hmm.

08:50.412 --> 08:53.556
That's fine. That's

08:53.576 --> 09:03.987
what my mind's like,

08:53.576 --> 09:03.987
yeah. What the people that you think that really 
stand out in your mind that you can remember that

09:04.007 --> 09:16.982
meant something to you and you can see, you know, 
you've known that they've done something to help

09:04.007 --> 09:16.982
out this town. Or the people that... I think it was 
Mr. Thomas. He was a great asset to this town. He is

09:29.893 --> 09:33.138
past that now. One of the first gym establishments 
we had was the Scott Place, which my daddy worked

09:33.158 --> 09:42.891
for him when he started. My daddy was the first vice 
in the morning. What about the cemetery of Bryan?

09:47.594 --> 09:51.939
Is there just one main cemetery, or are they just 
scattered out? No, we have two cemeteries right

09:52.279 --> 09:55.823
here in the city. One is operated by the city of 
Bryan, and the others are operated by no one now.

10:01.890 --> 10:04.634
This one out here was going up until a few years ago. 
We started raising sound about it. Like

10:06.876 --> 10:11.922
everything else, we weren't getting what we 
should have gotten. So we'll start pitching a fall

10:12.323 --> 10:17.048
at the bottom line. We didn't get one. They're 
keeping it now. That has been .

11:05.564 --> 11:11.451
You mentioned earlier that one of the original 
cotton gins was right here. In this same spot.

11:15.196 --> 11:16.858
This is West 18th Street? Was it 18th Street? Yes, 
it was 18th. Ever since you can remember? Yes. What

11:24.647 --> 11:26.690
about the other cotton gin in town? It was right 
where the food town is now. That's between Main and

11:28.292 --> 11:34.980
Bryan on

11:28.292 --> 11:34.980
the first of them. from the first group. Can you 
tell me just a little bit about, do you remember

11:39.532 --> 11:43.117
seeing it working? Oh, yes. I used to see a wagon of 
cotton lined up block long. Yes, I remember those

11:50.728 --> 11:52.250
days.

11:57.658 --> 12:00.903
What was the last year that they used cotton? I 
couldn't answer that. Did you ever pick cotton

12:02.665 --> 12:04.668
yourself? No.

12:10.027 --> 12:18.320
I never was fortunate to get out

12:10.027 --> 12:18.320
there. Even though my grandfather, come on. My 
grandfather had a, he farmed.

12:28.797 --> 12:30.820
Now this still was incidentally. That's one of the 
landmarks on the corner right there, by the way. It

12:34.916 --> 12:39.080
has been there all this time, and that's the past of 
it, not the present past of it. The other one passed

12:39.541 --> 12:43.544
on. I'll come back and check with you later. Let's 
chill in. He's trying to get some history of Brian.

12:49.270 --> 12:54.895
He's been here about seven years, so he couldn't 
tell you. History of Brian. Can you just tell me a

12:56.016 --> 13:00.520
little bit of Like, maybe like a day of what you can 
remember. The people at the cotton gin, like what

13:06.114 --> 13:09.658
they wore, or... Same as you today, blue jeans. 
Blue jeans? Really? See, see, old thing, why did

13:13.321 --> 13:15.584
you folks today dress them up? You called them 
Levi's. Yeah.

13:23.111 --> 13:26.395
Of course, it's a ducky front. Mm-hmm. Were they 
like overalls for you? No. It was kind of like an

13:32.275 --> 13:41.309
apron, you know, with suspenders on it. What about 
winning star clothing? I can't remember

13:45.235 --> 13:50.243
just what they wore. I'm almost sure if they wore 
anything, they wore more

13:51.444 --> 13:59.076
than ladies' nightwear.

14:03.882 --> 14:22.701
now

14:03.882 --> 14:22.701
that's about all that i know about really

14:23.626 --> 14:32.919
Well, has there ever been, like, any famous 
person, like a famous news star or something

14:23.626 --> 14:32.919
that's come to this area that really caused a big 
commotion among the people? Like, everybody goes

14:33.921 --> 14:40.410
down to see the person or

14:33.921 --> 14:40.410
something. Can you think of any? No. I can't think 
of a soul, because back there, if they came,

14:43.534 --> 14:53.228
in those days, we couldn't go. If they could 
naturally, we wouldn't be interested. We

14:59.399 --> 15:00.180
couldn't go anywhere.

15:04.968 --> 15:06.390
And it's just a little better now. Do you want to 
elaborate just a little? Well, we can go now. Not

15:13.562 --> 15:15.486
because every time we go, they want us to come. We 
can't help themselves. See, there were times you

15:18.773 --> 15:25.342
could have the money to buy one of those boats, but 
you couldn't go in and buy one. Well, you might have

15:25.362 --> 15:35.176
passed that back to them, but like I said, those 
moose dogs, if they came, we wouldn't have gotten

15:25.362 --> 15:35.176
to see them because they weren't welcome on it. Can 
you remember that one? Oh, yes. Heck, yes. You

15:38.841 --> 15:40.043
remember that, too. Yeah, that's been that long. 
Uh-huh. It hasn't been that long. You from where?

15:44.606 --> 15:45.047
What's your name? Colleen, Texas. Colleen, 
Texas. Well, see, my father's in the Army, and we

15:46.569 --> 15:49.594
just traveled all over. So I've never really 
stayed in my place. Well, it's been the same

15:51.316 --> 15:53.179
everywhere. It hasn't been too long since that has 
changed. And really, it hasn't changed as much as

15:55.423 --> 16:00.330
it should have changed now. But it's so much better 
than it was. But we are, I don't know whether you're

16:04.156 --> 16:07.962
going to say accepted. I don't think that would be 
the word.

16:12.368 --> 16:22.140
I think I could have thought like I said it then, but 
now, of

16:12.368 --> 16:22.140
course, no one can help themselves. What about the 
politics of Brian Manning? Was there Democrats in

16:24.744 --> 16:27.928
him, Republicans? Well, it's been mostly 
Democrats as long as I can remember. That was a

16:30.671 --> 16:33.955
Republican house, pardon me. Was your father a 
Democrat? No. If I'm not mistaken, no man was kind

16:39.162 --> 16:41.785
of leaning toward Republicans.

16:46.102 --> 16:49.307
because he's about the only one in the family with 
that. Democrats, I think. I say I think because I

16:54.134 --> 16:57.599
have time to go for who he thinks best. I don't know 
if he called me

16:58.060 --> 17:04.249
a Democrat or not. One instance of George Wallace 
going to run. That's what I mean by where the

17:20.088 --> 17:26.916
There's a big bookstore on the corner. What's that 
now on that corner? Drive-In

17:30.219 --> 17:38.949
Bank, isn't it? There's a big bookstore there. I 
remember it quite well, because I remember

17:39.610 --> 17:44.636
getting rid of it that one day, and hopped a car, of 
course. And something might have came out of the

17:46.398 --> 17:49.521
bookstore, so I left off there. Let me tell

17:50.918 --> 18:04.311
you about this. It's going to make me want to move. 
So that's why

18:07.153 --> 18:11.257
I remember the ducts were so wet. I forgot the name 
of the place. What about the prejudice in Brian? Is

18:14.700 --> 18:16.622
there a lot of prejudice? Can you remember ever 
being a lot? There's still a lot. Was it worse back

18:20.230 --> 18:24.396
then? Oh, yes, it was worse. Oh, yes, definitely. 
Certainly. Can you remember, like you just said,

18:28.962 --> 18:32.167
you gave me an example. Can you remember any other 
times when it was really... Yes, we'd go to the

18:35.392 --> 18:43.082
store, and you could go in the trolley dresser, you 
know why, but my boy couldn't do it. You have to buy

18:43.223 --> 18:44.905
it, and it's hoping it's going to fit. Yeah, that's 
what I can't understand. That hasn't been too

18:46.901 --> 18:53.312
long, because Neiman Marcus and those big stores, 
they haven't been too long since they started

18:46.901 --> 18:53.312
letting you try them on. You mean they just 
wouldn't let you try them on? Hmm, my color was

18:54.914 --> 18:55.675
wrong. You know, we get it there. I was working with 
a lot

18:57.599 --> 19:02.867
of them. Too long, I guess. That's still going on. 
Not that bad now. They can't discriminate against

19:07.014 --> 19:11.702
you now. But that's why I said she mentioned the OSB 
because now they can't afford to. Well, even if we

19:19.122 --> 19:26.370
have more, we have a little bit more sense now than 
we had then. I'm talking about us black folks. I

19:29.513 --> 19:30.294
said, used to you.

19:34.278 --> 19:35.800
Didn't think I had a nice car. Mm-mm. So it is. It's 
much better. Mm-hmm. And you being over at, uh,

19:44.251 --> 19:50.559
Rosenberg, you ought to know a lot about it. Of 
course, the smaller the town, the worse it was. But

19:52.862 --> 19:54.043
I'll tell you one thing about it, though. When we 
got ready to integrate the school system here, did

19:56.186 --> 20:00.391
nobody look back. Just integrate. Boom. Of 
course, during the time, as late as 71, I can

20:02.394 --> 20:13.448
remember that quite well, because we'd been in 
this thing until I was here working at the time, and

20:02.394 --> 20:13.448
they were raising hell about the busing. I'm like a 
fool. I just asked a question. I said, you mean the

20:16.635 --> 20:18.477
bussing is wrong? Yeah, it's wrong. I said, well, 
hell yeah, I was in it all my life. And it just got

20:21.881 --> 20:25.245
wrong. That's why I say a lot of you folks don't have 
no sense either. That was just in 71. What about

20:30.190 --> 20:33.234
your public school that you went to? Was it an 
all-black school? Yes, it was a campfire school. I

20:35.997 --> 20:39.301
think it was a campfire school in 38. Was it a little 
country school house, or was it public? It was a

20:41.303 --> 20:42.785
public school right here. I was there. E.A. Kemp 
High. We would get the Cleveland, as we do, a lot of

20:48.514 --> 20:53.941
it being done now. We'd get the, in other words, if 
we want the football uniform, we'd get what Brian

20:53.981 --> 20:59.369
Hyde didn't want. They'd buy them some more. We'd 
get that.

21:07.080 --> 21:10.865
Now this, you know, as I talk with y'all, y'all seem 
to think this is something new to y'all. Now y'all

21:10.885 --> 21:11.987
know better than that. And

21:13.975 --> 21:25.471
you, the Aggies, them sorry stonks used to come up 
the road to get about 20 a brass. You got to get out

21:25.651 --> 21:26.833
and let them by. That's the way they do it.

21:31.819 --> 21:36.446
I don't know how long that has been, but that 
happened. And back in those days, we may have seen

21:36.526 --> 21:39.650
it to get one of these. Because we ain't got one time 
to die. That's pretty nice. It's been a long time

21:44.367 --> 21:45.428
learning that. He showed us the gun. And you'd be 
surprised. We were friends. But we're just not

21:53.259 --> 21:54.040
friends no more.

21:59.948 --> 22:03.453
We get mad now sometimes because we think about how 
we've... I went to service for a while. We went over

22:06.978 --> 22:08.580
there to fight for you. Well, let's say with you. 
And... Come back here and they want to kick us some

22:13.763 --> 22:15.546
more. We're getting on and on. Not anymore. I think 
the service helped us because that is the place

22:18.331 --> 22:21.337
where we didn't mind. We don't want to die. We'd 
rather live for the country than die for it. But

22:23.761 --> 22:24.743
that's what we did. We got one time to die. And we got 
that instilled in us. And it's in us today. Oh, you

22:28.750 --> 22:32.016
still find a few of them that draw back. But life 
just has to be real. I'd rather die standing up than

22:36.899 --> 22:39.903
laying down. Excuse me. Let me ask you some more 
about, like in restaurants, like in the movies,

22:40.463 --> 22:47.071
I've seen where they have a white toilet for white 
people. Can you remember anything about that?

22:49.454 --> 22:53.279
Right here at your palace, we have a good stage 
called the Buzzard Rooms if you want to see it.

22:55.402 --> 22:56.523
There's a picture up there. If you want to see it, 
you have to go upstairs.

23:01.807 --> 23:05.894
I hadn't been too many years ago. I couldn't give 
you the exact date. I'll say this, though. There

23:11.124 --> 23:15.792
were a lot of the folk in this town that didn't want 
to do, but they had to follow suit, too, you know. I

23:15.832 --> 23:17.375
know your folk now. They weren't really afraid. I 
believe they weren't. No, they weren't afraid.

23:22.564 --> 23:23.486
They were scared. That's a difference. I think 
it's different for blacks in a small town than

23:25.347 --> 23:30.773
blacks that live in the Army post. Like, we always 
lived with blacks, and I never felt... Well, you

23:30.793 --> 23:36.139
had a little different culture. You had a 
conglomerate culture, like at A&M. Now, if A&M

23:40.644 --> 23:49.113
hadn't been out here when we got ready to 
integrate, I don't think it would have been as

23:40.644 --> 23:49.113
smooth as it was. And I think A&M was the... Not that 
they said anything, just being there.

23:57.528 --> 24:02.132
Now you say, well, if it helped that, why didn't it 
help at Prairie? Prairie was five miles from

24:02.192 --> 24:05.475
Hempstead. And all they did was let them vote to 
what's the right now. They just did that. So, well,

24:13.042 --> 24:17.386
I guess it's because it was a white college. I guess 
that meant that Prairie was a black

24:17.526 --> 24:22.851
college. Can you tell me anything about Prairie? 
What do you want to know? Well, like... Anything

24:27.582 --> 24:29.964
you know about it? Was it a big thing when they first 
built it? Oh, I don't know when they first built it,

24:32.847 --> 24:46.941
but it was about the biggest state school

24:32.847 --> 24:46.941
that I grew up. See, it's still being run by the .

24:55.527 --> 25:00.474
Of course, you have a few white students.

25:00.494 --> 25:06.342
I know a few white people,

25:00.494 --> 25:06.342
of course. What about, you said you attended 
Southern? Oh, Southern University in Baton

25:08.765 --> 25:13.511
Rouge, Louisiana.

25:13.531 --> 25:16.756
How was it when you were in college? Well, it was all 
black, too. But I went down there.

25:25.733 --> 25:29.419
to a football game.

25:29.439 --> 25:31.443
And they were in the middle of a strike. And I said to 
myself, I'm going to school here any time black

25:32.825 --> 25:37.393
folk get together and stick together. I said, I 
need to be a part of . I

25:39.075 --> 25:44.324
graduated fourth grade. What about, like, do they 
have a fire department around here? Yes, I don't

25:51.518 --> 25:59.789
know how, I can tell you when, when, where, and why, 
because when I, as I remember, there was one there

25:51.518 --> 25:59.789
then. Okay, the one you remember, did it have, was 
it a truck or? I don't think you're old enough. The

26:07.079 --> 26:08.781
one that I remember was a truck, yes. Did

26:08.801 --> 26:14.809
they have black farming or?

26:19.565 --> 26:20.907
I'm not going to lie, I wasn't a birthday party. He 
had gotten married two weeks ahead. I was mad. And I

26:24.352 --> 26:24.852
went. I had a lovely time. But holy cow. And he 
wanted the next little preacher to marry him.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.062
That's how the preacher loved him so much. He just 
wouldn't do it because his man's daddy was raised

26:32.082 --> 26:36.829
insane. But I had a lovely time. I'm just going to 
wipe now.
