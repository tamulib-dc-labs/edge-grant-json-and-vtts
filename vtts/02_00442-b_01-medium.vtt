WEBVTT

00:02.157 --> 00:09.546
He got to be a general.

00:09.566 --> 00:10.607
Was he a West Point man? Oh yeah. Most of you, okay, 
then all of your ROTC officers, the ones on active

00:13.010 --> 00:24.884
duty stationed here at A&M in the 30s, as far as you 
can remember, they were all West Point men. I think

00:26.106 --> 00:29.650
it had been mighty unusual if they weren't. None of 
them were originally from A&M?

00:36.653 --> 00:40.698
Well I don't know about others and the other 
branches.

00:43.120 --> 00:59.620
Of course we uh

00:43.120 --> 00:59.620
we had the different branches on campus and we 
didn't get very closely acquainted with people

00:43.120 --> 00:59.620
outside of our own branches and I'm sure that all of 
those that were associated with us in the

01:00.528 --> 01:03.372
artillery branch for Westmoreland. Okay. Now 
tell me about these ROTC camps. Well, we went to

01:07.539 --> 01:14.049
Camp Bullis, Texas outside of San Antonio.

01:16.934 --> 01:27.430
Our

01:16.934 --> 01:27.430
other branches of ROTC went to other locations.

01:30.093 --> 01:31.876
The duration was six weeks. We lived a very spartan 
military existence. We had long, demanding days.

01:46.422 --> 01:53.434
We were supported by, in my particular

01:46.422 --> 01:53.434
camp, C battery of the 12th Field Artillery, our 
horse-drawn outfit from Fort St. Houston.

02:05.851 --> 02:14.442
We function directly under one of the sergeants 
and the battery. Of course, we use their

02:14.463 --> 02:21.632
equipment, their horses, their artillery 
pieces, caissons, and all.

02:26.658 --> 02:32.685
I'd say that it was quite a fine military training 
experience. And you were also in this ROTC camp

02:34.266 --> 02:40.893
with other cadets from other colleges? Yes, a few 
other colleges, not very many. What colleges were

02:43.837 --> 02:44.898
they? Oh gosh, it seems to me that we had some people 
from Oklahoma State University. I don't remember

02:52.865 --> 02:54.507
others. Nearly everyone there was a Texas A&M. 
How'd you get along with these others? Was it a

03:01.218 --> 03:02.460
rivalry? Oh, well, I wouldn't say so beyond the 
rivalry you'd have when you're rotated into

03:03.341 --> 03:21.268
leadership positions of platoon sergeant

03:03.341 --> 03:21.268
or battery commander for a day or for an exercise or 
whatever.

03:23.932 --> 03:31.846
but of course you didn't have any real authority, 
so you were dependent upon the cooperation of

03:23.932 --> 03:31.846
people.

03:35.833 --> 03:46.733
There just weren't any reactionary people in ROTC 
in that time, so you got it right off just by having

03:35.833 --> 03:46.733
the cadet position, whatever it was. support and 
loyalty pretty well just taken for granted. What

03:51.964 --> 03:54.207
do you mean there weren't any reactionary people? 
What do you mean by that? Well of course we now see so

03:56.429 --> 04:17.732
prominently the draft resistors

03:56.429 --> 04:17.732
and activists of one kind or another from 
homosexuals to whatever it might be and of course

03:56.429 --> 04:17.732
those things

03:56.429 --> 04:17.732
just weren't accepted during that period of time 
and there just wasn't any of it. Right. Everyone

04:25.853 --> 04:27.314
was there to do a job? They were there to do a job. 
Anybody that didn't conform

04:30.978 --> 04:40.128
usually didn't stay at Texas A&M very long. So the 
people around Texas A&M at that time We're all

04:45.826 --> 04:47.188
pretty much alike. I won a card related to these 
things, which you occasionally find student

04:47.888 --> 04:59.441
complaints and uprisings on campus.

05:02.645 --> 05:08.552
There's nearly always some kind of springtime 
cause that students get associated with. Since

05:09.132 --> 05:14.078
everybody lived in military outfits, if the 
leaders decided that we were going to protest

05:15.374 --> 05:32.356
something, there was a whole lot greater 
participation in protests than there would be

05:15.374 --> 05:32.356
now, dispersed.

05:33.457 --> 05:44.031
I remember that in the spring of my senior year that 
there was an organized protest,

05:44.467 --> 05:58.286
which was that the cleaners around the campus were 
going to raise the price for cleaning and pricing a

05:44.467 --> 05:58.286
pair of pants from 15 cents to 20 cents. That was a 
major cause that we had, I think. And did you have a

06:03.573 --> 06:05.055
lot of these causes? I mean, did you have a lot of 
protests? No, no, not very many. I remember the

06:10.282 --> 06:12.465
leaders were protesting. Lauderstein was one of 
the cleaners then. Youngblood, of course,

06:20.615 --> 06:33.231
they had student employees around each military 
outfit that would take up cleaning and pressing

06:20.615 --> 06:33.231
for them to take it in. My gosh, the prices of the 
day, as you think about it, They sure do seem low

06:38.112 --> 06:40.698
compared to now. They sure would buy a lot, I know. 
The meals in the dining hall, I believe our board

06:46.030 --> 06:51.281
bill was $21 a month. Later reduced to $18 a month. 
My goodness. So that's about what you earned as a

06:57.957 --> 07:11.933
student laborer, so I guess the relationship 
between the earning power and what you can buy are

06:57.957 --> 07:11.933
about the same as today, but there wasn't much 
money around. Now it appears that you feel that the

07:14.196 --> 07:21.304
Corps of Cadets then builds character. Would you 
agree with that? Oh, absolutely. Well, I've heard

07:24.957 --> 07:30.622
that said many times before, and I always like to 
ask, well, what does that mean? What does it mean

07:31.002 --> 07:34.265
that they build character? Well, the 
expectations are fairly plainly expressed.

07:45.415 --> 07:54.964
There is a discipline,

07:45.415 --> 07:54.964
and those that succeed conform and accept the 
discipline, the relationship with others, the

07:56.783 --> 08:09.178
standards expressed.

08:09.198 --> 08:11.101
To me, those things are part of character. I think 
they shape a person's

08:12.482 --> 08:22.875
standards for living, not only in the military, 
but in other aspects too. Do you think that the

08:23.716 --> 08:27.761
Corps had an impact on the fact that you became a 
leader? Oh, certainly. Could you explain?

08:35.910 --> 08:51.208
Well, there is no question the reinforcement I 
would receive from these

08:35.910 --> 08:51.208
ROTC instructors that I admired so much a little 
pat on the back here or there would inspire me to try

08:51.830 --> 08:56.155
to do better.

08:59.638 --> 09:15.074
Here again, the tasks laid out, whatever they 
might be, there were certain standards, and if you

08:59.638 --> 09:15.074
performed up to the standards or exceeded them, 
you would be reinforced by recognition from the

08:59.638 --> 09:15.074
ROTC instructors. It was very stimulating.

09:22.610 --> 09:26.316
What were your feelings when the Corps was made 
voluntary in the 1960s? I was 100% for it. As a

09:29.500 --> 09:41.458
matter of fact, I was a member of the three-person 
study committee concerning compulsory ROTC and

09:29.500 --> 09:41.458
COIDS at Texas A&M. Really? Certainly. The Corps 
had such an impact on your life. Why would you not

09:47.227 --> 09:51.874
want to have the Corps part of every young man's 
life? I would, but I wanted him to make the choice

09:52.411 --> 09:57.457
himself because the times had changed. Even my own 
sons didn't choose to go through the ROTC program

09:58.658 --> 10:07.209
for Texas A&M. Though they did enlist in Army 
Reserves and put in their careers that way,

10:18.719 --> 10:29.109
Somehow the mood of the country and the young 
people had changed and I just don't believe in

10:18.719 --> 10:29.109
forcing people at that age to do something they 
don't accept. That's

10:29.129 --> 10:44.845
really peripheral to the main purpose of Texas A&M 
and was more peripheral in the 60s than it was in the

10:29.129 --> 10:44.845
30s.

10:47.963 --> 10:51.487
That's

10:47.963 --> 10:51.487
a good point. Often people or journalists, 
sometimes scholars, talk about a military

10:51.507 --> 10:57.193
mentality. They put this in quotes. Is there a 
military mentality, and if there is, could you

10:58.495 --> 11:01.678
explain it? Well, there is a military mentality, I 
believe, but it's not the same today as it was in the

11:03.821 --> 11:09.887
30s. The military mentality changes, too.

11:16.938 --> 11:29.758
There's no question that in the 30s, military 
officers had authority that was accepted, and

11:16.938 --> 11:29.758
that military command was authoritarian.

11:32.642 --> 11:45.882
Because the young people that were in the 
services, or the older people too, had grown up in a

11:32.642 --> 11:45.882
disciplined environment and families, and they 
accepted authority. That's certainly not true

11:47.532 --> 11:49.435
today. There is much more democracy in military 
leadership. It's essential that there be, and

11:56.083 --> 11:59.267
there is. There is much more participation in 
decisions, and leadership is a lot harder today

11:59.568 --> 12:15.649
than it was in those days, where authority was just 
taken for granted and accepted.

12:19.173 --> 12:44.826
I'd say that the military mentality

12:19.173 --> 12:44.826
is dominated by the fact that in a military 
organization, a person is expected to be willing

12:19.173 --> 12:44.826
to make the ultimate sacrifice to give up his life 
for whatever purpose he is committed to. And

12:45.532 --> 12:47.995
that's a dominant thing. You certainly have to be 
disciplined to do that in spite of being beset by

12:48.015 --> 13:06.419
all the fears and doubts that one has for a cause and 
upon demand by leaders that you respect. You will

13:06.720 --> 13:15.471
accept great danger and sacrifice to the point of 
giving up your life for your associates and for

13:16.987 --> 13:21.293
your country. That's part of a military 
mentality. And is that still believed? Is that

13:25.499 --> 13:27.321
still believed today in your opinion? That giving 
up your life? I believe it is by a substantial

13:32.468 --> 13:39.317
portion of the population.

13:39.337 --> 13:40.399
What about the military? What about the 
population of the military?

13:45.725 --> 14:02.044
Well, I think that this permeates the military, 
but I don't think that it does to the same degree

13:45.725 --> 14:02.044
that it is generally accepted as it was a few years 
ago. I see.

14:12.961 --> 14:16.486
that there are other motives for participating in 
the military. I deplore the fact that we're trying

14:17.026 --> 14:30.465
to buy people

14:17.026 --> 14:30.465
and that compensation seems to be a dominant 
factor right now. Because I don't believe that you

14:30.525 --> 14:39.036
get the same sort of a zeal and determination

14:39.758 --> 14:45.206
same sort of performance, people that are 
motivated that way as they are just because

14:39.758 --> 14:45.206
basically. By higher salaries, huh? Yeah, by 
higher salaries or whatever, just because

14:46.668 --> 14:58.325
basically they are there during the time, during 
the period to protect the freedom of the country.

15:04.715 --> 15:08.280
I sure believe everybody has an obligation to do 
that.

15:11.146 --> 15:21.219
I would like to see every young person in the United 
States be called on to make some sacrifice to

15:11.146 --> 15:21.219
protect the freedom of the country. Now that we're 
on this, would you include women in that?

15:27.347 --> 15:28.729
Absolutely, I would now. There's no question my 
attitude has changed over that time based upon my

15:30.231 --> 15:36.759
experience with women in the Armed Forces. Well, 
could you describe that now that we're on this

15:37.260 --> 15:39.583
topic? How has it changed? Why did it change?

15:50.404 --> 15:58.772
I was associated with some young women in the Army 
Reserve Organization. They were just

15:58.853 --> 16:00.694
outstanding soldiers.

16:04.338 --> 16:08.322
They performed mighty well in the tasks assigned 
to them. Which type of tasks? Well, in most cases

16:13.271 --> 16:20.040
these were administrative type of activities. 
There were officers in? Well, officers and

16:21.942 --> 16:29.452
non-commissioned officers.

16:29.472 --> 16:37.482
My experience with the young women in the Army 
Reserves was quite favorable.

16:40.330 --> 16:53.464
I'm sure that is a part of their equal rights that a 
very high proportion of the females in this

16:40.330 --> 16:53.464
country are willing to take up whatever 
sacrifices there might be. It was a mighty big

16:53.484 --> 17:09.021
shock to me when I got into France and I found women 
that

16:53.484 --> 17:09.021
couldn't be trusted to actually, of course, 
ambush somewhere a soldier. served as snipers.

17:13.190 --> 17:19.578
That was a real shock to me that women would be 
combatants in some way like that. Were these

17:19.598 --> 17:22.381
German women? No, they were French women that had 
been associated with the German army and that

17:22.801 --> 17:34.094
really were supporters of the German people in one 
way or another. And they were taking shots at you?

17:38.363 --> 17:40.466
Oh, hell yes. These women cleared down to the coast 
of France and all where we went in. We learned

17:47.475 --> 17:53.744
pretty soon that my generation would trust women. 
They would never think of it as that. We learned

17:56.608 --> 18:00.713
pretty soon that you couldn't trust the women in 
that area. Many of them had collaborated with the

18:00.793 --> 18:08.083
Germans.

18:09.515 --> 18:16.564
had been, had accepted the Nazi cause and couldn't 
be trusted. Of course, after the American army

18:16.584 --> 18:27.819
went through, the native

18:16.584 --> 18:27.819
French people dealt with them very harshly. 
Shaved their heads and in some way identified

18:28.821 --> 18:34.408
those that collaborated with the Germans. They 
were ostracized and worse, But anyway, the

18:40.852 --> 18:48.980
Russians of course were using women during that 
period in their armed forces. There was some in the

18:49.000 --> 18:56.186
German military, I guess some exposure along in 
World War II, in the combat phase. And this changed

18:56.707 --> 18:59.830
your ideas in the 1930s. That was the beginning of 
the change. That started to change. Then the

19:03.513 --> 19:10.099
primary thing that changed my attitude about 
women in the armed forces was in the Army Reserves,

19:11.783 --> 19:16.909
I found them in a lot of the organizations.

19:16.929 --> 19:33.567
I'd have to say that after the draft was released 
and we were recruiting under the voluntary army

19:16.929 --> 19:33.567
concept that we got more responsible people and 
women than we did men. As a matter of fact, the

19:33.587 --> 19:36.311
standard for recruitment were higher. Really? 
Oh, sure. Still are. Still are. It takes higher

19:43.242 --> 19:54.236
qualifications to enlist in the army or army 
reserves as far as I know today for females than it

19:43.242 --> 19:54.236
does for men. Okay, I wasn't aware of that. Oh yeah, 
well you have to make higher scores on the

19:56.019 --> 20:00.024
intelligence test to have a higher status. 
Really? Sure. Doesn't that seem like

20:02.287 --> 20:03.829
discrimination? Well it is. Sure it is.

20:10.171 --> 20:14.716
As far as I know, in the last three or four years, 
they haven't changed that. We still have to make

20:14.977 --> 20:16.719
our scores. You can't take them in category four on 
their intelligence status as you could men.

20:27.051 --> 20:28.793
They've got to be more highly qualified. So on the 
average, the ones we recruited during the

20:30.756 --> 20:39.486
Voluntary Army period were more intelligent, 
more responsible. more dependable. So I

20:42.398 --> 20:47.567
developed a lot of respect for young women in our 
forces. You know, our sexual standards have

20:47.587 --> 20:54.017
changed a little bit, and we didn't worry so much. 
First, we would have been mighty embarrassed to

20:55.740 --> 21:03.533
people my age on the latrine facilities in the 
vicinity and that sort of thing, but that's just

21:05.825 --> 21:15.454
changed now.

21:15.474 --> 21:30.328
As far as I know, in several years of experience, we 
didn't have any improper sexual incidents with

21:15.474 --> 21:30.328
women integrated into our military outfits. Not 
any at all.

21:37.364 --> 21:42.670
What were your ideas about women in the service 
back in the 1930s when you were here in the Corps?

21:42.690 --> 21:44.552
Well, we never even considered it. It wasn't even, 
well, that would be the farthest thing from our

21:45.133 --> 21:49.197
minds. Nobody expected

21:49.418 --> 21:55.644
women to participate. I guess the study during the 
time, two years I served on this committee,

21:55.665 --> 22:03.253
studying compulsory ROTC and coeds at A&M, that I 
developed a little bit of an attitude then,

22:05.309 --> 22:17.209
because even then, for at West Point, women could 
go take graduate

22:05.309 --> 22:17.209
work. It's

22:17.229 --> 22:22.899
a changing pattern in the country.

22:25.383 --> 22:29.069
In other words, then you see A&M as a flexible 
institution. Certainly.

22:34.216 --> 22:36.301
And you see that as a positive aspect? Certainly, 
certainly. At that time, that was such an

22:39.267 --> 22:53.018
emotional question that the committee members' 
names were kept real. secret and as far as I know it

22:54.331 --> 23:07.051
never even been revealed to this day but the 
integration of women in the Texas A&M proceeded

22:54.331 --> 23:07.051
exactly according to the recommendations of that 
committee. Archie Flowers over at the College of

23:07.071 --> 23:09.976
Veteran Medicine was chairman of it.

23:13.281 --> 23:15.024
Who else is on that committee? Oh there's one 
gentleman and uh there were just three of us the

23:15.044 --> 23:22.195
other gentleman was in mechanical engineering 
I'll declare as All right.

23:28.312 --> 23:47.760
Getting back to the Corps,

23:28.312 --> 23:47.760
when you, in 1942, went into the military on active 
duty, what did you find was the opinion of other

23:28.312 --> 23:47.760
officers toward Texas A&M officers? Well 
actually I went in in August of 1941 to

23:49.445 --> 23:56.093
serve a year.

23:59.317 --> 24:00.939
But you went in April of 1942. No, I got into the 
artillery in April of 1942, but I was already in the

24:00.979 --> 24:10.050
Army when it was the Pearl Harbor time. Oh okay, 
then can you tell me, can you tell me, okay well

24:10.450 --> 24:18.540
we'll talk about that next, that you went in in 
1941. Let's talk, let's answer this first

24:18.925 --> 24:27.835
question now about the opinion of others when you 
went in in 1941 toward A&M officers. Oh, the A&M

24:27.855 --> 24:30.979
officers had a fine reputation in the Army. Well 
accepted. Good performers. They do today. I'm

24:36.585 --> 24:37.606
very proud of that. Even from the West Pointers? Oh 
yes. No snobbery or? Well, not very much. Of

24:48.479 --> 24:48.679
course, There's always, there's no question 
during those days that the officers from the

24:49.385 --> 25:04.084
military academy had an age in being considered 
for promotions.

25:04.104 --> 25:05.926
They deserved it. Why do you say that? Well, they 
were better. You think a West Point graduate is

25:08.730 --> 25:12.695
better than an Aggie graduate? I think for early

25:13.876 --> 25:18.582
performance, In the Army? Yes. That's his whole 
purpose during four years and previous training.

25:26.204 --> 25:38.464
Now, after two or three years, things even up, and 
the person can perform according to his own

25:26.204 --> 25:38.464
ability. But there's no question in my mind that 
the training in the U.S. Military Academy is

25:44.161 --> 25:51.330
better for a lieutenant to immediately perform in 
the active army than Texas A&M. Sure.

25:54.694 --> 25:56.616
Just by the nature of the military institution? 
Well of course, that's what that's the, that's the

25:56.697 --> 26:08.752
whole purpose of it there, and they accomplished 
that purpose, but I don't think advantage lasts

25:56.697 --> 26:08.752
over two or three years. You put the two people 
together and after two or three years, A person

26:13.557 --> 26:21.444
from Texas A&M may be better qualified than a 
person from the U.S. Military Academy. They will

26:21.464 --> 26:23.205
have gone to service schools. They will have had 
experience. Those things will have evened up the

26:26.128 --> 26:37.598
early advantage that the Military Academy person

26:26.128 --> 26:37.598
has. There wasn't feelings that, well, you guys 
are just from A&M and we're from West Point or

26:37.618 --> 26:43.243
something? You thought you were well accepted 
then? Oh, no question. I was right the first

26:48.146 --> 27:02.970
battery appointment I had was in the same military 
outfit that had served with us on ROTC camp. I was in

27:05.110 --> 27:12.098
there with a young man named Smith, a fine officer 
from the military academy. We were battery

27:12.298 --> 27:14.180
officers together. There's no question we had 
mutual respect.

27:20.607 --> 27:22.429
My god, he was a fine officer. Didn't get promoted 
from second lieutenant to first lieutenant until

27:23.190 --> 27:29.277
his whole class got promoted. It just happened 
that the second infantry division was an old line

27:29.377 --> 27:34.763
division. They caddied to form three other 
divisions, but those of us that stayed with the

27:35.553 --> 27:47.213
division always said, well, they kept the best 
ones in the division. They sent the worst ones out.

27:50.478 --> 27:59.333
So anyhow, he was a second lieutenant just like I 
was and didn't get promoted until his whole class

27:50.478 --> 27:59.333
got promoted to old West Point class. What about 
other ROTC officers from other institutions?

28:03.555 --> 28:13.549
Most institutions at early 1940s had ROTC, of 
course, and what did what did they think of A&M, or

28:03.555 --> 28:13.549
how did you get along with those people? Well, I'd 
have to say we had a superior attitude

28:15.111 --> 28:27.328
as commissioned officers in the Army about most 
ROTC graduates.

28:33.047 --> 28:36.251
We thought we were better than they were, and in a 
lot of cases we were. However, there were many

28:36.372 --> 28:47.809
officers in my own artillery battalion from 
Oklahoma State University. Actually, after a

28:47.829 --> 28:52.776
short time, I think we had an early advantage. Just 
like I'd say that the Military Academy people let

28:53.617 --> 29:00.406
over us because of the emphasis on ROTC Texas A&M. 
But I'd say that advantage would fade away in six

29:01.568 --> 29:06.655
months or something in the active Army. We had 
fine, fine officers that obtained their ROTC

29:07.756 --> 29:18.130
commissions from Oklahoma State

29:07.756 --> 29:18.130
University. Okay, let's talk about education 
here at A&M. We've talked about the Corps for an

29:20.253 --> 29:23.337
hour or so. Of course the main reason you were here 
was education. Let's talk about education. Who

29:30.316 --> 29:33.800
were instructors that had an influence on you?

29:36.743 --> 29:51.518
Well here again I'd say that all of

29:36.743 --> 29:51.518
those that I had a great respect for the 
instructors that I was associated

29:36.743 --> 29:51.518
with. the faculty members in the College of 
Agriculture Texas A&M had a genuine interest in

29:53.607 --> 30:02.319
their students at that time. It was a very good 
association. I'm proud that I think that still

30:06.284 --> 30:11.471
exists today. Even with more students? Oh sure. I 
think our student-teacher ratio has not been

30:14.255 --> 30:19.181
altered all that much. Sure. But D.W. Williams was 
head of the Animal Science Department, a

30:23.155 --> 30:28.363
gentleman who's still living today. The baby's 88 
years old.

30:33.030 --> 30:38.458
Great respect for him, admired him, still do. A.K. 
Mikey, instructor in the Animal Science

30:38.958 --> 30:51.677
Department, who somehow took some special liking 
to me and got me associated with research early.

30:52.973 --> 31:06.092
When I was a sophomore,

30:52.973 --> 31:06.092
he was working on beef, on meat tenderness 
research with Dr. Sylvia Culver, who's still

30:52.973 --> 31:06.092
alive today. A.K. Mackie died a couple years ago. 
These were fine, fine people. Gee, they would

31:13.483 --> 31:21.394
honor me by asking me to make trips with them 
sometime.

31:24.057 --> 31:28.101
got me involved in academic activities that were 
carrying on.

31:34.326 --> 31:43.314
I'm

31:34.326 --> 31:43.314
mighty proud of the people I was associated with in 
classes. Dr. Charles N. Sheppardson was Dean of

31:43.334 --> 31:46.797
Agriculture. Well, E.J. Kyle was when I was a 
student, later Charles Sheppardson.

31:57.622 --> 32:05.927
They were people to be admired.
