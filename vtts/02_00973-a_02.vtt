00:03.001 --> 00:12.311
Sir, this is in regards to the training you 
received prior to going to Vietnam or even in

00:03.001 --> 00:12.311
Vietnam on the Vietnamese culture or language. 
Did you receive any training in that area? During

00:16.316 --> 00:21.101
the three weeks at Camp Pendleton, we received 
training on the Vietnamese culture. We received a

00:22.503 --> 00:30.932
few words or instruction on a few words of 
Vietnamese, like halt.

00:32.633 --> 00:54.726
do you surrender things of that nature but there 
was no extensive training language training at

00:32.633 --> 00:54.726
all and it was not necessary because the type of 
contact that an infantry organization has you

00:32.633 --> 00:54.726
don't need the language training i don't think it 
would be cost effective anyway except for those

00:55.600 --> 01:00.588
people that are dealing with Vietnamese on a daily 
basis and have to be conversable. In other words,

01:00.608 --> 01:09.561
you can be assigned to a built-up area, or to a town 
like Da Nang, and still not have to speak

01:00.608 --> 01:09.561
Vietnamese. I'm sure there are Vietnamese 
citizens around, and it would be convenient if you

01:09.701 --> 01:22.080
could, but a lot of people have the type of jobs 
where they do come in daily contact. We were

01:22.313 --> 01:28.560
confident that their job didn't mean that they had 
to talk to Vietnamese. You're in a military

01:28.580 --> 01:37.470
compound, you're working with other Marines or 
other Americans, and you can get your job done

01:28.580 --> 01:37.470
without the language. When I was there, there was 
always a curfew at night. Of course, Marines

01:41.515 --> 01:45.019
worked in the daytime, so there was little 
exposure. There was no liberty in that country, so

01:45.039 --> 01:50.565
social contact was nonexistent. Still, when you 
go into a village or you're patrolling an area, you

01:52.098 --> 02:01.752
do need to know the various things that upset a race 
of people or a certain culture. For instance, I

02:01.812 --> 02:10.425
remember you weren't supposed to pat Vietnamese 
on the head like you do American children, like

02:01.812 --> 02:10.425
you're a good boy or you're a good girl. That's 
offensive to them. If they want to walk in front of

02:14.170 --> 02:20.940
you, they will put their hands down like this and 
kind of bow their head to pass in front of you. That

02:21.376 --> 02:25.402
doesn't mean that they're showing signs of 
inferiority. That's just their way of saying,

02:25.822 --> 02:30.789
excuse me, to pass it in front of them. They would 
not actually say excuse me to an American that

02:30.809 --> 02:37.578
looks like they're being subservient to us. So 
it's good to know those traits, characteristics,

02:38.279 --> 02:50.556
because it keeps you from becoming the ugly 
American, creating the wrong impression. On

02:50.941 --> 02:57.652
this topic, how about the enlisted men? When they 
would go on patrols or go through towns, did they

02:58.033 --> 03:06.266
have a problem with, say, respecting the culture? 
Particularly, I know the Vietnamese have a habit

03:08.089 --> 03:13.518
of holding hands. Did that cause problems? I don't 
think it did. After you've been there any length of

03:19.755 --> 03:24.660
time, you realize that was just their way of doing 
things. The Vietnamese are not the only society

03:24.700 --> 03:29.886
that hold hands. It's quite prevalent throughout 
the Orient. If you spend any time in the Far East as I

03:32.529 --> 03:38.235
had, you knew that that was just one of their 
customs and practices. And after you've observed

03:38.955 --> 03:41.518
it for a while, it didn't bother you. I'm sure it 
bothered the on the list of Marines initially but

03:42.224 --> 03:58.095
again all of them went through that three weeks 
training at Camp Finland and they were told that

03:42.224 --> 03:58.095
these type of things happen and it doesn't mean the 
same thing to them that it does to us.

04:03.105 --> 04:04.367
In going into their villages found that most of the 
people were very leery of Americans. Of course,

04:11.692 --> 04:12.940
they were living to the Americans in daytime, and 
then the Viet Cong would come out at night. So they

04:16.701 --> 04:18.564
didn't want to appear overly friendly to us. And 
they would stay back in their houses or out in their

04:19.325 --> 04:23.871
fields and stay away from us. And it wasn't an 
atmosphere where, oh, here comes the American,

04:24.512 --> 04:33.044
and we'd all flock around him and hope to get 
chewing gum and candy and that type of thing. They

04:33.064 --> 04:35.567
were very aloof or distant. They didn't want to 
have too much contact. Then at nighttime, the

04:37.971 --> 04:43.078
local populace would hole up in their houses or in 
their village. There was no contact with the

04:43.514 --> 04:46.177
Americans at all at that time. So really, when a 
Marine, an infantry Marine, saw a Vietnamese that

04:46.197 --> 05:05.016
was on a, he was working, he was out patrolling, 
passing through a village or around the village,

04:46.197 --> 05:05.016
he had very little, well, had no social contact. He 
might have to gather people up and search them and

05:05.476 --> 05:12.103
move them along from one area to another. Again, it 
wasn't social contact. You were out there doing a

05:15.770 --> 05:27.246
job, and you didn't have a chance to see all these 
type of actions or symbols that the local culture

05:15.770 --> 05:27.246
used to be upset. Now, if you were stationed 
full-time into May, you'd have greater access to

05:27.306 --> 05:37.180
the local populace, or if you were in Saigon, I'm 
sure this situation will be completely

05:38.881 --> 05:43.047
different. It could even take classes while 
you're over there on what the culture is for you to

05:43.707 --> 05:50.436
understand that. All right, sir. The next 
question is concerning military leadership and

05:51.438 --> 05:58.607
problems such as drugs, careerism, fragging. Did 
you have any observations concerning the quality

05:59.869 --> 06:05.196
of leadership over there? Well, I had... I guess I 
had observations on the quality of leadership, as

06:08.378 --> 06:18.412
well as limited observations on the other 
subjects that you just mentioned.

06:22.317 --> 06:24.820
I found the leadership to be good.

06:28.525 --> 06:34.774
Of course, as I said, I was a senior captain by those 
standards.

06:37.302 --> 06:39.544
was more experienced than the other captains. I 
have to also point out that the way we operated as an

06:40.025 --> 06:49.715
infantry company commander, I had little contact 
with the other company commanders. I did by radio,

06:49.735 --> 06:53.159
but seldom visually. We went out as a company and we 
would operate independently under the guidance

06:53.779 --> 06:59.946
of the battalion. They would direct us by the radio 
transmission. but seldom were two companies

07:04.488 --> 07:17.806
adjacent to each other in the classic sense of 
companies online, where daily you would

07:04.488 --> 07:17.806
coordinate with the company on your right and the 
company on your left, and the company in the

07:04.488 --> 07:17.806
reserve behind you. We didn't have that type of 
environment. So the only time I got to see the other

07:20.089 --> 07:30.664
company commander would be a brief session when we 
were getting ready to jump off on a

07:20.089 --> 07:30.664
battalion-level operation. And we were all in for 
a briefing and coordination before we jumped off.

07:35.496 --> 07:37.860
And so I had Lindy in contact with them then. After 
the operation, we all flushed and went back to the

07:37.880 --> 07:44.069
respective zones. And never had a chance to see 
around and just shoot them back. So the people that

07:47.654 --> 07:55.185
I had more experience with were obviously the 
commanders above me. I had three battalion

07:56.106 --> 08:01.073
commanders, three different battalion 
commanders while I was a company commander. And

08:01.627 --> 08:06.052
the operations officer I saw all the time had two 
different operations officers. And then, of

08:06.072 --> 08:10.858
course, the officers who worked

08:06.072 --> 08:10.858
for me. The three battalion commanders that I had 
were all superb. One of them, well, one of them, two

08:14.683 --> 08:17.246
of them were superb. One was good, but the other two 
were just superb. Both of the operations officers

08:22.973 --> 08:31.363
were truly outstanding and did a great job of 
directing the operations of the battalion.

08:32.339 --> 08:51.208
Concerning the officers and staff 
non-commissioned officers that worked for me, at

08:32.339 --> 08:51.208
that time we were so short of infantry officers 
that we had to take officers, non-infantry

08:32.339 --> 08:51.208
officers, and make them or assign them to the 
infantry companies for 90 days. I only, in a

08:52.711 --> 08:59.241
six-month period, as I recall, I only had three 
lieutenants that had an infantry background. I

09:01.745 --> 09:18.590
had an engineer, tank officer, several different 
types, and they were there during their initial 90

09:01.745 --> 09:18.590
days of combat duty with the infantry before they 
would go on to a tank organization or an engineer

09:01.745 --> 09:18.590
organization. So I would say at least 50% of the 
lieutenants who worked for me were not infantry.

09:24.379 --> 09:26.342
They were in for a great shock when they got there. 
They knew that the reason they were there was

09:26.845 --> 09:44.705
because infantry officers didn't survive very 
long, and probably part of the motivation for them

09:26.845 --> 09:44.705
being, let's say, an engineering officer as 
opposed to an infantry officer was he didn't like

09:26.845 --> 09:44.705
the infantry type of work. It just wasn't his cup of 
tea. When he got out there and found that he was

09:46.747 --> 09:55.857
assigned to an infantry organization,

09:46.747 --> 09:55.857
he was probably in shock.

09:58.486 --> 10:08.435
In fairness to those folks, though, I had an 
engineer officer that was very quiet, but he did a

09:58.486 --> 10:08.435
superb job. He wasn't showy like some infantry 
officers are. I was not impressed with him

10:13.680 --> 10:17.564
initially, but he got the job done. His unit was 
always well prepared and well taken care of. I had

10:23.029 --> 10:26.873
an infantry officer that I had to relieve. I 
couldn't trust him. But I think you'll find that in

10:30.083 --> 10:33.207
any situation. But if I had to stereotype a group of 
people, I would say that they were all very good.

10:38.994 --> 10:41.898
You'll have your exceptions any time. People that 
just aren't fit for that type of duty. I had one

10:45.542 --> 10:52.490
staff non-commissioned officer who was accused 
of being a coward under fire. I'm not sure. I wasn't

10:55.625 --> 11:08.022
there on the scene when it occurred,

10:55.625 --> 11:08.022
so I don't know if that is, in fact, the truth. He was 
a staff mountain commission officer who'd been in

11:08.042 --> 11:11.167
the Marine Corps 17 years. There was a great effort 
to court-martial

11:11.187 --> 11:19.919
him, and I refused to do so. He had to be the sergeant 
for the lieutenant, but I didn't trust him. When I

11:24.970 --> 11:27.854
did, I finally got him reassigned to special 
services. There was no point, in my view, of taking

11:28.776 --> 11:45.181
a man who had spent 17 dedicated years in the Marine 
Corps and court-martialing him on a thin thread of

11:28.776 --> 11:45.181
evidence, as I saw him, and ruining his life. And I 
think it would have ruined his life. He was,

11:46.863 --> 11:52.672
because of the actions that were going on, he was 
very distraught. I didn't think it was necessary.

11:54.721 --> 11:59.126
All right, sir, did you have any problem with 
drugs, or did you see any drugs use at all? I

12:00.067 --> 12:01.909
encountered use of drugs one time. That was back 
when our company was in a rear area, and we were able

12:03.811 --> 12:12.221
to stand down for one night in one of the tents over 
in the mess area. This was over in a battalion mess

12:12.241 --> 12:15.004
area, not one of mine. There was a group of people, 
and I probably had a few people in there, that were

12:16.806 --> 12:22.332
smoking marijuana. That's the only situation, 
the only occasion that I know of. When we were out in

12:26.990 --> 12:33.160
the field, it simply didn't happen in my company. 
We had a policy of anyone who was caught on drugs was

12:33.180 --> 12:43.999
immediate

12:33.180 --> 12:43.999
non-judicial punishment or court-martial and 
reduction in rank. but out in the out in the field or

12:44.941 --> 13:09.126
the bushes we call it your life depended on each 
other and there was a great social stigma for

12:44.941 --> 13:09.126
everyone to be alert and prepared and i think the 
people who used them knew that

12:44.941 --> 13:09.126
they were impaired wherever they were spoken to so 
they didn't do it Was there an occasional time?

13:13.456 --> 13:14.577
There could have been. But the thing is, marijuana 
has a strong, distinctive odor. You're always

13:18.022 --> 13:23.470
checking your positions at nighttime, not only to 
come to commander, but to commanders and to

13:18.022 --> 13:23.470
sergeants. And you would notice something

13:23.490 --> 13:27.877
on the water. We were out there in the middle of 
nowhere, where we had to rely on each person. To my

13:33.365 --> 13:35.468
knowledge, it just never happened. Now, I did hear 
stories about back in Saigon and back in Da Nang and

13:36.562 --> 13:54.482
back in Da Nang, where smoking went on every night,

13:36.562 --> 13:54.482
as well as fragging of people, officers and staff, 
noncommissioned officers. I've heard of Marine

13:54.502 --> 13:57.024
officers being fragged. I never knew of anyone who 
was, nor did I, nor was I aware of a specific

13:57.525 --> 14:05.033
incident. Again, I was out in the field for six 
months and never saw one tree or a dog hawk at all,

14:05.637 --> 14:20.114
except the one night I spent going and about the 
three nights I spent coming back. I was just

14:20.134 --> 14:25.080
unaware of anything

14:20.134 --> 14:25.080
at that time. All right, sir. Did you see any 
careerism go on? Any officers that perhaps were

14:29.285 --> 14:35.492
trying to get their ticket punched so they could 
move up and Quite the contrary. And I was really

14:39.413 --> 14:47.420
surprised just to have seen that question on the 
topic sheet that you submitted to me earlier.

14:51.944 --> 14:58.070
I was trying to, I was wondering where the question 
came from and what was the basis of the question. I

14:58.090 --> 15:03.555
would guess back in Saigon, maybe depending on the 
higher level staffs, You might run into queries.

15:08.768 --> 15:12.072
I said, to the contrary, I run into just the 
opposite. When my first battalion commander's

15:12.092 --> 15:19.842
tour was nearing completion, I asked him one day 
who was going to be his relief, and he said he didn't

15:12.092 --> 15:19.842
know. He said, there are three infantry 
battalions, or CO's positions of three infantry

15:19.862 --> 15:29.413
battalions, that are coming open within a week or 
two of each other. It's time he was leaving. He said

15:31.548 --> 15:39.036
there were 11 lieutenant colonels back at the 
division headquarters who were eligible to go out

15:31.548 --> 15:39.036
and take over the battalion. At that time, the 
commanding general's policy was you just didn't

15:39.136 --> 15:50.589
take a person from the United States, a lieutenant 
colonel from the United States, and assign him to a

15:39.136 --> 15:50.589
battalion. You put him on the division staff for 
four to six months so he could get the lay of the

15:56.354 --> 16:09.193
land, if you will, understand the rules of 
engagement, the nature of the war, so that he

15:56.354 --> 16:09.193
didn't go in unaware of how the war should be 
fought. What we found, and what Lieutenant Curcio

16:09.213 --> 16:23.475
told me, was that of the 11 lieutenant colonels who 
were in that situation, one wanted a battalion.

16:24.164 --> 16:29.231
and one other would take the battalion if offered. 
This was quite a shock to me as a young officer. I

16:32.935 --> 16:38.322
thought all people aspired for command, 
particularly in combat. What it meant was that

16:38.342 --> 16:47.394
life was dangerous out there and it was hard, and 
commanders could get relieved because things

16:38.342 --> 16:47.394
didn't go well or go right. If you were a staff 
officer in the rear, get your ticket punched, to

16:49.679 --> 16:58.874
use that phrase, get your combat time in, get a good 
finish report, and go over and come back with your

16:49.679 --> 16:58.874
career.

17:02.420 --> 17:10.152
And you didn't get hurt, because as a staff officer 
it's more difficult to mess up than the SS men do. If

17:11.448 --> 17:14.916
you want to call that careerism, yes, it is. Kind of 
a protective careerism. When I saw the note

17:18.384 --> 17:23.736
careerism, I took that in the context of here are 
officers They want to get an infantry

17:24.374 --> 17:34.983
organization or a command and go out and be daring 
and take chances and do reckless things in the name

17:24.374 --> 17:34.983
of getting hit. And I certainly didn't see that at 
all. It didn't happen with any of the three

17:38.226 --> 17:49.196
commanders that I had or any of the company 
commanders that I associated with or any of the

17:38.226 --> 17:49.196
junior officers. It just didn't happen. All 
right, sir. Concerning your operations that you

17:50.157 --> 17:53.740
were on, what... Were there any failures?

18:00.739 --> 18:04.323
Depends how you classify failures.

18:10.511 --> 18:19.423
If you say you were not successful, you had a 
failure, you probably could say so, but for

18:10.511 --> 18:19.423
instance,

18:27.757 --> 18:37.249
A fire base had been closed, and we went back in to 
open a fire base and launch new operations against

18:27.757 --> 18:37.249
the North Vietnamese. We bombarded that fire base 
for about six hours before my company, as the lead

18:39.672 --> 18:44.437
company, flew into it. When we got there, what 
enemy forces had been there were gone. It was

18:51.346 --> 18:53.889
obvious that we were coming. We bombarded the 
area, and we flew in right on the last shell, so to

18:58.148 --> 19:00.794
speak. Did we find, fix, and destroy any enemy at 
that point? No, we didn't. Was that a successful

19:07.067 --> 19:08.450
operation? Well, at the time, I didn't feel like it 
was because I hadn't killed any more of the enemy

19:08.490 --> 19:16.326
forces. On the other hand, that was a piece of real 
estate that we now owned and controlled. We

19:23.303 --> 19:33.943
controlled all the movement in that area, so it was 
a successful operation.

19:36.421 --> 19:44.554
And that was more typical than atypical, that you 
would do many combat operations. Some you would

19:44.994 --> 19:47.799
engage the enemy and some you would not. Where we 
engaged the enemy, we were always successful. But

19:51.264 --> 19:56.252
we were on one operation with the Vietnamese that 
we could have been successful. But we were not. We

19:58.723 --> 20:00.145
were on a large carton operation. That's where 
we'd fly in a bunch of units and march in a bunch of

20:00.165 --> 20:07.053
units, forming huge rectangle people. As I 
recall, the piece of real estate where we fought

20:07.153 --> 20:14.401
the North Vietnamese were was about 4 kilometers 
by 10 kilometers. We put a carton around this area.

20:19.487 --> 20:26.796
Unfortunately, the Vietnamese soldiers moved in 
at a different rate of movement than we did, with

20:19.487 --> 20:26.796
stuff gaping holes in the carton. And then over the 
weekend that we were there, they just sat down,

20:28.109 --> 20:34.299
basically shut down. It didn't work. It was left 
gaping holes. Our game plan was to close down the

20:38.145 --> 20:48.701
court and make it smaller and just put a squeeze on 
the enemy forces that we called in, that

20:38.145 --> 20:48.701
intelligence that we had in it. When we did that, we 
didn't come under

20:48.721 --> 20:53.308
it. I never saw anyone fleeing, so I don't know if 
that was... successful operation or an

20:56.543 --> 21:01.290
unsuccessful operation. It was not successfully 
executed, from my point of view, because the

21:01.330 --> 21:10.544
Vietnamese left gaping holes in the mines. So had 
there been North Vietnamese in there, they could

21:10.564 --> 21:16.012
have gotten out. I saw other companies that had 
Firefights where they had to leave their people

21:21.063 --> 21:32.478
out there for a while, half a day to a day, with their 
casualties before they could go

21:21.063 --> 21:32.478
get them. As I indicated, most firefights or 
skirmishes are brief and intense, and if you're

21:32.498 --> 21:43.392
caught unprepared, you're going to take some 
casualties.

21:45.869 --> 21:50.776
Depending on the size of the action, you could take 
any number from 1 to 10 to 50. But because you were

21:52.839 --> 22:01.752
fighting on another man's turf, he could land into 
the countryside and he took his casualties with

21:52.839 --> 22:01.752
him. You never knew how many, in most cases, you 
didn't know how many casualties he suffered. The

22:08.061 --> 22:09.343
engagements were at night. They were on the 
outside of you. Of course, you collected your

22:11.626 --> 22:13.950
casualties. They'd pull theirs off and they were 
gone. You come to expect

22:17.206 --> 22:21.232
that. There are occasions when you completely 
overwhelm them, and you've got their casualties

22:21.252 --> 22:27.402
right there. And so you know that you've got some. 
You never know. All right, sir. Do you have any more

22:33.873 --> 22:36.817
comments on the success of your operations? Well, 
I would have to say we were successful. We didn't

22:43.531 --> 22:45.273
take too many casualties. We moved a great number 
of people, great distances. We controlled a lot of

22:48.256 --> 22:51.118
land, countryside.

22:54.622 --> 22:59.447
I felt that we could move about fairly freely now. 
By that I don't mean loosely, without proper

22:59.567 --> 23:04.752
security. But I was not fearful of moving 
anywhere. By using proper tactics and having

23:12.590 --> 23:24.927
proper security, you go moving from point A to 
point B, from one mountain to another mountain,

23:12.590 --> 23:24.927
through a valley up to the militarized zone. Now, 
there are times when it gets scary. But I was

23:30.294 --> 23:34.000
confident enough that we could move about day and 
night. So from that point of view, it had to be

23:35.241 --> 23:37.765
successful. I think we controlled the 
countryside. All right, sir. The next portion of

23:41.902 --> 23:44.685
the interview will deal with your views. All 
right, sir. All right, sir. If you could comment on

23:49.872 --> 23:52.895
your views of the Arvin.

23:58.842 --> 24:01.245
Well, again, I had very little contact with him. Of 
course, I was over there twice. What many

24:03.828 --> 24:07.032
Americans don't realize, or didn't realize, is 
that the Vietnamese had been in a war for many years

24:07.737 --> 24:13.846
before the Americans got there. It became a day of 
life for

24:13.866 --> 24:24.281
them, or an existing routine.

24:24.301 --> 24:30.230
The war had probably been going on 10 years before 
we got there. In their view, it could go on another

24:30.250 --> 24:36.259
10 years or another 20 years.

24:38.635 --> 24:41.959
And so their outlook on fighting a war was 
completely different.

24:45.283 --> 24:54.575
The Americans' outlook on the war is to get in 
there, prosecute the war to the fullest, and then

24:45.283 --> 24:54.575
get out as quickly as you can. So we went in there 
eager, wanted to engage the enemy, defeat him,

24:54.595 --> 25:08.052
wash our hands of the whole mess, and then get out of 
the country.

25:12.419 --> 25:40.519
and when you see someone who doesn't whose actions 
don't indicate they believe the same thing you

25:12.419 --> 25:40.519
tend to look at them as if they're not good soldiers

25:12.419 --> 25:40.519
they're not good military people are they just not 
good people in general and that's certainly not

25:12.419 --> 25:40.519
the case with the vietnamese i think the 
vietnamese were very very industrious people

25:12.419 --> 25:40.519
that surely been borne out by those the boat 
people, the refugees who have come to this

25:40.685 --> 25:43.810
country. They're dedicated people. They believe 
in their family. First of all, the Vietnamese

25:49.498 --> 25:55.247
believe in their family more than anything else. I 
don't think Americans can say that. We probably

25:57.971 --> 26:06.283
have, most Americans have stronger ties to their 
country than they do their family. Vietnam is

26:06.303 --> 26:08.346
family first, country second. I'm not sure that's 
the case in this case. But they moved at a different

26:14.548 --> 26:18.316
pace than we did. They were war-weary. They'd been 
fighting for 10 years. We came over there for 12

26:21.884 --> 26:24.530
months and got out. We, being individuals, came 
over there for 12 months and got out. I'm sure it

26:31.057 --> 26:35.584
would be hard to get a bunch of the enemy's hyped up. 
Okay, we're going to go out and build a crushing

26:35.604 --> 26:43.056
blow to the

26:35.604 --> 26:43.056
mountain. After ten years, you know, so many types 
of going out and did a crushing blow. What was one

26:47.643 --> 26:48.425
more? It just wasn't going to happen. Then we came 
in there with all of our muscle and might and ready

26:51.369 --> 26:58.701
to hold the war for them. I can't really blame, 
particularly in hindsight, those people for

26:59.407 --> 27:06.014
sitting back and saying, we're going to have this 
big showy bully. I'm not calling us bullies, but

27:06.154 --> 27:12.220
this big showy guy who's coming in and going to show 
us how to fight a war. OK, well, we'll just sit back

27:13.061 --> 27:21.809
and let

27:13.061 --> 27:21.809
him do it. We'll see what situation the Vietnamese 
is in now. I think they should have sat back and let

27:23.931 --> 27:27.675
us do it, but we sure did. take over the country and 
turn it back over to them in such a shape that they

27:28.482 --> 27:39.437
wouldn't be able

27:28.482 --> 27:39.437
to belong. And the South Vietnamese people are the 
same people as the North Vietnamese. I have the

27:46.787 --> 27:51.033
greatest admiration for the North Vietnamese. 
I'm sure with proper leadership of the South

27:54.740 --> 28:00.889
Vietnamese, their organizations were just as 
good, just as fierce. There were some units there

28:00.909 --> 28:09.842
in the Da Nang area, I don't recall the names, but 
they had a tremendous economy. And I think the

28:09.862 --> 28:15.650
Ontario organization, it's a function of 
leadership. It's a good organization.

28:22.567 --> 28:28.134
I think the Vietnamese were properly led and 
motivated. All right, sir. Do you have any, in your

28:30.578 --> 28:35.644
experiences with the ARVN, any command 
conflicts? No. I did not, because mainly I was at a

28:39.309 --> 28:45.337
level where we did not have to coordinate the 
supporting fires. That went on at a level below me.

28:47.700 --> 28:49.022
I am aware of conflicts. For instance, you have 
fire support zones. If something was going on near

28:54.349 --> 29:05.369
you that was in another zone, then you couldn't 
fire there without it being cleared by his

28:54.349 --> 29:05.369
adjacent zone commander. And we do that in actual 
combat operations, but we didn't have the dual

29:05.389 --> 29:15.827
clearance of the U.S. military commander and then 
the Vietnamese zone commander. But I've heard

29:17.849 --> 29:24.110
that was a problem that their parents were not 
timely, but I never experienced it. All right,

29:24.131 --> 29:24.592
sir. I need to change the tape now.
