WEBVTT

00:01.415 --> 00:14.392
We had at that point in a very quick period, less 
than 120 days, the capability to do planning a la

00:01.415 --> 00:14.392
Florida or any other mandatory planning state. 
That's what we're embroiled in now, trying to

00:16.054 --> 00:24.004
educate the people involved in the system. It's 
hard to get everybody up to speed as to what that

00:24.144 --> 00:27.068
means. We're so used to zoning being planning 
around this part of the world that it's taken a

00:28.043 --> 00:36.278
massive educational participatory structure. 
We could have as professionals prepared a plan,

00:38.482 --> 00:44.112
but it won't work in Austin. And a mandatory plan 
would not work unless there was a very massive and

00:44.132 --> 00:49.461
structured way educate people on the 
relationships between planning, regulation,

00:50.116 --> 01:03.676
the consistency doctrine, adequate service and 
facilities ordinances, and all the kinds of

00:50.116 --> 01:03.676
techniques of planning and growth management as I 
believe in them. Let's talk about the consistency

01:06.400 --> 01:09.345
doctrine for a minute. I don't know where that term 
doctrine appeared. And I'm not even sure if it is a

01:13.100 --> 01:16.764
doctrine. And I don't think it's been pinned on 
anyone yet. But it does remind me of Oregon and the

01:20.789 --> 01:27.677
mandated planning procedures in Oregon. And all 
of their, quote, acknowledged, unquote, plans

01:28.258 --> 01:34.966
that have to be promulgated by cities as well as 
counties. And that if they don't act accordingly,

01:35.046 --> 01:40.993
then they're open to lawsuits. Right. The 
question then is, when

01:42.682 --> 01:58.004
is zoning and other development action 
considered to be consistent with an adopted

01:42.682 --> 01:58.004
comprehensive plan? And what constitutes 
consistency? What about the time lag between

02:01.308 --> 02:06.135
short-range and medium-range and long-range? 
These are questions that I don't find adequately

02:06.175 --> 02:10.661
answered in the literature. Well, I tend to agree 
with that. There's kind of two ways to talk about

02:12.972 --> 02:16.696
consistency. My first bath in consistency came 
from what I was seeing happen in California,

02:18.218 --> 02:29.611
perhaps Oregon also, but I didn't follow the 
Oregon system that well. But I was repeatedly told

02:29.631 --> 02:42.726
by peers at conferences, just in general 
networking talk and discussion over a few years,

02:29.631 --> 02:42.726
that consistency had become interpreted in 
California Your document had to be internally

02:43.634 --> 02:53.706
consistent, you know, one policy among another, 
water to sewer to wastewater to parks, all that

02:43.634 --> 02:53.706
kind of, that's very logical to understand. The 
plan should be internally consistent, very

02:53.746 --> 02:59.172
rational approach. But what was coming out of some 
of the mandatory plan litigation in California

03:07.478 --> 03:19.110
was that you were getting lawsuits by either the 
developer or the neighborhood or the

03:07.478 --> 03:19.110
environmentalist challenging legislative 
decisions not being consistent with their plan.

03:19.551 --> 03:22.935
Well, that was kind of a new phenomenon. I haven't 
talked about 10 or 15 years ago even. That was kind

03:24.977 --> 03:27.600
of a new phenomenon when you're challenging 
zoning. You don't challenge planning. You accept

03:28.961 --> 03:30.683
the absence of it, perhaps. And just following 
that whole discussion over a period of months and

03:31.824 --> 03:37.350
years that that people could actually overturn a 
zoning decision because they found a council did

03:38.917 --> 03:46.984
not follow their plan. Or even better, that a 
developer could get his denial overturned

03:47.004 --> 03:59.495
because the council had ignored its plan that said 
he could do that, or something to that effect. I

03:59.515 --> 04:04.619
mean, the two-edged sword of the consistency 
doctrine I found very, very interesting. The

04:05.400 --> 04:08.282
issue of timing. became very focused in Florida 
when the legislation there is replete with

04:08.566 --> 04:17.734
consistency requirements. In Broward County, 
where I spent my sojourn, the interpretation in

04:19.135 --> 04:38.252
Broward County by the county commission and their 
plan, which ruled over 29 cities as well as all the

04:19.135 --> 04:38.252
unincorporated jurisdiction down there, was you 
brought your plan and your zoning consistent

04:39.599 --> 04:44.165
within one year. Within one year? Because Florida 
statutes required in a little phrase that zoning

04:45.927 --> 04:56.059
shall be consistent with a plan within one year of 
its amendment. Well, they used that to say if we

04:57.882 --> 05:05.911
plan the reaches of the county to have commercial 
out here 20 years from now, you go ahead and zone it

04:57.882 --> 05:05.911
now. Now, that was a... And we spent one of our whole 
continuing processes was staff initiated zoning

05:07.426 --> 05:15.597
to conformity. We were continuously preparing 
studies, initiating county commission

05:15.657 --> 05:26.891
rezonings to consistency so the zoning map would 
look like plan map. And that is a problem. Now,

05:29.615 --> 05:35.442
that's a problem that I've had to deal with in other 
arenas as we moved into the land development code

05:35.742 --> 06:04.315
regulatory systems the impact fee systems which 
i've had considerable experience with because

05:35.742 --> 06:04.315
the timing of adequacy and the delivery of 
services and the moratorium that's implied if

05:35.742 --> 06:04.315
services aren't adequate you cannot in the 
consistency doctorate grant the project on the

05:35.742 --> 06:04.315
other hand if you find those searches adequate or 
pay an impact fee, you can approve the project.

06:09.615 --> 06:15.922
That didn't get at the timing issue, but it got at an 
issue about what is a plan. How can you make a

06:17.364 --> 06:26.454
roadway consistent with a plan in the future when 
we know zoning traditionally is planning? So you

06:26.575 --> 06:33.002
may show it on a map today and plan a road for it, but 
what really going to be out there 10 or 15 years from

06:26.575 --> 06:33.002
now may not equal the capacity that you've built 
into your roads and all that. So I've dealt with

06:37.242 --> 06:38.284
that. And I have a style of planning theory we're 
going to try to embed in the Austin plans,

06:38.304 --> 06:50.021
comprehensive land use element, that I think 
bridges that gap. And it's not mapping the

06:50.041 --> 07:00.357
multicolored yellows, reds for residential and 
commercial in the traditional sense that you'd

06:50.041 --> 07:00.357
have to say, well, that's commercial, so zone it 
today. I don't believe in that one-to-one

07:01.349 --> 07:04.152
correlation. I believe in the timing, long range, 
and short range. But I have a different value and a

07:07.056 --> 07:11.582
different philosophy of what the land use plan 
should be. The land use element of the

07:13.104 --> 07:16.248
comprehensive plan. It shouldn't just be a 
surrogate zoning map. And that's what it's

07:18.651 --> 07:19.952
traditionally been. Well, that's what it's been 
in Texas as well as other states. And going way back

07:25.499 --> 07:30.225
to the model land use planning, act of the 
Department of Commerce with Secretary Hoover and

07:30.678 --> 07:43.415
the consequences of confusion that that 
generated in the planning profession for

07:30.678 --> 07:43.415
decades.

07:45.938 --> 07:52.747
The planners themselves got confused between the 
land use element and the zoning ordinance. For

07:53.248 --> 08:00.297
example, Harlem Bartholomew would from time to 
time insert a zoning ordinance into his plan

08:00.985 --> 08:06.411
documents for various communities, thinking 
that that would take care of land use. We've not

08:07.572 --> 08:10.855
entirely emerged from that, I suspect. No, no. And 
see, it's that whole philosophy that made me

08:11.876 --> 08:17.322
skeptical about coming back to this part of the 
world again. Well, Norman, I'd like to have you

08:17.342 --> 08:28.073
elucidate on your concepts of what comprehensive 
plans is and how it relates to implementation

08:28.745 --> 08:34.412
devices. Well, we are working on a report here to go 
to our land use task group, part of our big

08:34.432 --> 08:49.870
participatory structure that's involved in the 
Austin plan process. How many are in that? Well,

08:52.073 --> 08:58.060
there's 87 officially appointed council 
representatives representing nine political

08:59.204 --> 09:25.752
interests in the community they are decomposed 
into 14 various task groups working on water

08:59.204 --> 09:25.752
wastewater environment land development code 
house you know all the elements of the plan okay is

08:59.204 --> 09:25.752
it and they have appointed on to the you know six or 
eight of each of those are on one of these task

08:59.204 --> 09:25.752
groups then from the bottom up there's other 
resource people, board and commission members,

09:26.018 --> 09:31.705
so you flesh out about 20, 30 people in any one of 
these groups. I see. It's very elaborate. We can

09:34.508 --> 09:38.093
give you the process document, how these things 
operate. How many, is there any geographic

09:38.413 --> 09:43.219
representation by neighborhood? Yes, yes. 
They've got the largest block of representatives

09:44.140 --> 09:48.205
in the process. That's similar to the Austin 
Tomorrow process. Similar, but different.

09:57.710 --> 10:14.948
Because what's different about it, it does have a 
broad vested interest representation from not

09:57.710 --> 10:14.948
just the neighborhoods and environmentalists, 
which I have been told Austin-Tamara

09:57.710 --> 10:14.948
deteriorated into. The big hitters pulled out of 
the process and went on and started doing muds. And

10:20.213 --> 10:24.578
so for whatever reason, I think this has... The 
whole thrust of our participatory structure is to

10:24.946 --> 10:31.776
reach consensus among the groups that have never 
sat down and talked to each other. So it's

10:31.796 --> 10:35.381
hopefully balanced to do that. That's the 
question that's still out there. OK. What about

10:40.388 --> 10:46.316
your concept of the content of a comprehensive 
plan for us? Well, I truly believe it needs to be a

10:47.378 --> 10:54.868
public goals policy document. although it's 
going to be a very thick document, I think. Will it

11:00.838 --> 11:04.784
be a general plan or will it be more or less of a 
development plan? It's going to be a hybrid. A

11:11.175 --> 11:12.997
hybrid. It's going to look somewhat traditional 
and it's going to look rather innovative in some

11:13.799 --> 11:20.890
respects, I hope. Let me back up and tell you what I 
think the key is that I hope to embed in the thing if I

11:22.912 --> 11:30.904
have any influence on it. If you take a traditional 
land use map, multi-colored map, you pull out and

11:30.924 --> 11:38.155
fold out of tons of plants. They're generalized, 
you know, red commercial here, gray industry

11:38.175 --> 11:45.826
here, green for parks, whatever the color coding 
system is. The art and science of planters pushing

11:50.654 --> 11:58.603
those blobs around on the map and having them mean 
anything quantifiably is rather lacking. We do

11:58.623 --> 12:03.910
acreage and absorptions and projections, 
whatever techniques are used. They're pretty

12:04.390 --> 12:06.793
sad, in my opinion. They're good, reasonable 
estimates, perhaps. They represent community

12:10.297 --> 12:14.803
beliefs about this is good, we ought to have this 
here or that there. What we really do, though, is

12:15.363 --> 12:18.467
back off in the regulatory system And right 
ordinances don't have a damn thing to do with

12:18.903 --> 12:22.928
reaching those goals. They have more to do with 
whatever the political issue is, an

12:23.849 --> 12:34.703
environmental problem, or right of watershed 
ordinance, or got a problem with signs, right of

12:23.849 --> 12:34.703
sign ordinance. But that has no correlation, 
really, with achieving the objective of the city

12:34.743 --> 12:42.173
looking like that 20 years from now. And there's 
not that good a tie to making sure that capital

12:43.114 --> 12:47.239
investment is being timed and sequenced to make 
that plan, because that plan is too general,

12:47.995 --> 12:53.741
perhaps. But if you take that red map and that green 
map and that yellow map, my philosophy of how you

12:54.722 --> 13:05.834
bridge this system is to quantify those blobs in a 
relationship way. And we've got a rather lengthy

13:05.875 --> 13:11.941
report that we're going to be bringing out here in 
the next 90 days or so. In a manner that does not try

13:13.923 --> 13:17.327
to predict the use of every parcel of property in 
the planning sphere of jurisdiction in a sense

13:19.400 --> 13:34.134
that it's all at this corner going to be red or green 
or blue or whatever the color might be. But to have

13:34.155 --> 13:45.846
those

13:34.155 --> 13:45.846
designations on your plan map represent planned 
impact or intensity levels which we have done

13:46.838 --> 13:55.230
quite a bit of research and coming all the way out of 
our impact analysis basis in Florida. We've set up

13:55.250 --> 13:57.753
a system that starts very simply. The single 
family unit equivalent is not a particularly new

13:58.674 --> 14:03.701
idea. But rather than saying this land supports 
three to five single family units, we would say

14:04.983 --> 14:16.339
this has a single family unit equivalent 
intensity value. And we also have a scale in there

14:19.546 --> 14:30.279
that says one single family unit is the same as .8 
townhouses or .3 duplexes. They're all related

14:30.619 --> 14:35.765
across a scale of traffic impacts initially. Then 
quantifiable charts and tables about water

14:36.626 --> 14:45.617
quality and water quantity and sewage quantity 
and all these, you know, rather rigorous You've

14:46.272 --> 14:48.315
got a size for water and sewer. They're 
impact-related equivalents. Now, you can

14:52.040 --> 14:55.004
bifurcate one of those districts. You could say 
everything is equivalent from a traffic point of

14:55.364 --> 15:02.594
view and just have one blob on your mat wouldn't 
tell you a thing. But where you want higher

15:03.915 --> 15:10.684
intensity, you'll raise the FAR and scale up 
intensities. We have a corollary set of value

15:11.345 --> 15:15.030
systems that relate square footage of office, to 
square footages of industry, to square footages

15:15.989 --> 15:30.366
of discrete use types, so that we know that the same 
amount of office space in any particular zoning

15:15.989 --> 15:30.366
category will have the same impact. So what we're 
trying to plan is the probable future impact, not

15:30.386 --> 15:36.253
the probable zoning that's going to happen there. 
But in a mandatory plan system, we'll let zoning

15:36.273 --> 15:43.222
take its place over time as market dictates. 
You've got an intensity level. that might permit X

15:45.655 --> 15:58.096
quantity of office, a little less quantity of 
retail, same traffic impact, you may choose in

15:45.655 --> 15:58.096
that district to convert to high-rise apartments 
equivalent to the same traffic impact. It's that

15:59.538 --> 16:02.483
kind of dimension we're starting to explore. Now, 
you are assuming that the traffic impacts are

16:03.104 --> 16:10.137
going to remain constant from current 
phenomenon? It's all predicated on, right now,

16:10.157 --> 16:22.581
very traditional relationships like an ITE 
schedule, you know, that says a house generates

16:10.157 --> 16:22.581
0.76 trips per day. peak hour or 10 trips per 80. 
It's a beginning generalization. I don't care.

16:29.073 --> 16:31.175
You could change that mix any way you want to. I'm 
not trying to make it mathematically perfect. I'm

16:34.818 --> 16:44.106
trying to say let's not predict this is going to be 
retail and have no way to know how much retail is

16:34.818 --> 16:44.106
going to be there. We're going to fix retail in the 
plan at an intensity, at an FAR level. But we're not

16:51.192 --> 16:53.074
going to say that's all it can be there. There could 
be apartments there of the same relative impact.

16:59.424 --> 17:02.589
When you say impact, you're talking about traffic 
generation impact? Starting first from a traffic

17:02.609 --> 17:05.713
generation point of view. We've had a number of 
discussions with various members of the Planning

17:07.034 --> 17:13.082
Commission and others who think, well, that's 
ridiculous. There's other impacts. Why don't you

17:14.043 --> 17:15.926
do a multivariate? We squish it all up. You can't 
get to the point of quantifying that use and put it

17:22.400 --> 17:24.262
right into your traffic model. You can't quantify 
those uses and size of water line if you've made

17:24.282 --> 17:30.390
them all surrogates. You have to start with one 
dimension. What's the most serious dimension of

17:33.614 --> 17:37.098
public service? In my opinion, in 22 years, it's 
roads and traffic. Such an enormous lead time,

17:41.403 --> 17:49.453
such a massive amount of land to acquire, and the 
greatest capital cost, Your roads are fairly

17:50.277 --> 17:52.640
going to be fixed. The only question is how large 
they need to be and can you regulate through a plan

17:52.660 --> 18:03.214
land use intensities that will never exceed that 
planned roadway capacity. Yeah, you can under a

18:03.234 --> 18:06.478
system like we're talking about. You can't under 
the two-dimensional traditional multicolored

18:06.498 --> 18:10.403
land use map. So that's the, you may disagree, but 
that's the direction we believe we're taking

18:10.423 --> 18:18.934
because it takes you then from a mandatory impact 
planning system to a flexible zoning system you

18:20.298 --> 18:46.727
can make regulations do what regulation ought to 
do policy decisions in the plan right now every

18:20.298 --> 18:46.727
zoning decision it's immaterial what the 
requirements of the zoning ordinance are it's an

18:20.298 --> 18:46.727
original decision by city council where that's 
good at that location you know it's planning by

18:20.298 --> 18:46.727
individual ad hoc case well This is interesting 
for me to hear this because when I started

18:47.720 --> 18:57.631
planning, there were no such things as tables of 
traffic generation factors. We had to conduct our

18:58.152 --> 19:00.555
own field research. Absolutely. And we need to do 
that today. Yeah, we need to update it. We need to do

19:04.720 --> 19:06.942
a lot of that kind of stuff. We need to localize and 
do, in my opinion, we need to have the capability to

19:11.615 --> 19:16.960
replicate ITE tables here on a biannual or 
quarterly basis. Or just say, hey, it was changing

19:16.980 --> 19:19.203
in Austin Texas. I mean, our phenomena are not the 
same as they are in Washington DC. But it wouldn't

19:23.006 --> 19:30.234
take much to do this just on a spot survey basis 
during different times of the year and so forth.

19:30.254 --> 19:41.385
But all I'm saying, we're trying to develop a 
planning mapped mandatory land use system that

19:30.254 --> 19:41.385
gives you a capability If this is the consensus of 
what this community today wants this city to be,

19:42.192 --> 20:00.232
high intensity here, low intensity there, 
traditional neighborhoods here, transit

19:42.192 --> 20:00.232
corridor station locations for light rail here, 
we're going to fix those in relative quantity in

19:42.192 --> 20:00.232
plan. You're not going to exceed these. Now, you 
can move across the variety of mix from retail to

20:02.875 --> 20:12.165
industry to housing at the zoning change time, the 
compatibility time, 20 years from now but we can

20:13.377 --> 20:38.912
plan now the roadway system if you achieve the 
upper limit that will be satisfactory and then we

20:13.377 --> 20:38.912
can back down and we can also stepwise figure of all 
the potential uses in there which one's the most

20:13.377 --> 20:38.912
water demanding which one's the most sewer 
demanding and back into a planning methodology it

20:13.377 --> 20:38.912
can it can be automated quite frankly oh yeah And as 
you make planning amendments from year to year or

20:39.415 --> 20:48.306
however, you can also produce it now needs to amend 
the roadway. If you want to change the plan and up

20:48.366 --> 20:55.275
the density, the consistency doctrine tells me I 
got to go back and change the roadway plan. I got to

20:55.315 --> 20:56.456
change the water plan. I got to add more parks. And 
you do what planners have always been wanting to

20:58.259 --> 21:04.947
do, relate facilities to planning, adequate 
services. That's my latest. I'm out of the impact

21:06.938 --> 21:09.981
fee game, and I'm into the planning impact. And to 
show to the commission and the council what the

21:10.001 --> 21:15.387
consequences would be of making these decisions. 
Absolutely. I don't care personally as a planner

21:16.028 --> 21:26.839
to tell a community, this should be a commercial 
shopping center, this should be a nine-story

21:16.028 --> 21:26.839
high-rise. No, cut it to six. I don't like the 
zoning game. This community needs to decide what

21:30.743 --> 21:33.006
it wants to be. If it wants to change that, we need to 
be able to show them Don't just change that zoning

21:36.858 --> 21:49.474
without knowing that you're going to have such 
congestion here and the consistency doctrine

21:36.858 --> 21:49.474
requires you to find a way to change immediately 
the roadway plan. We're going to make decision

21:49.494 --> 21:56.923
making, make some tough choices in the future 
instead of just playing with the old traditional

21:49.494 --> 21:56.923
game.

21:58.725 --> 22:02.730
That's a pretty tough agenda. It is. And nobody 
knows that's the agenda here. Except me. But I

22:10.262 --> 22:15.870
believe that's what the public wants out of its 
governmental decision-making systems. Well, I

22:15.890 --> 22:18.714
think that they also want something more than 
that, Norman. I think that they want professional

22:19.415 --> 22:32.092
judgments to be exercised in terms of 
recommendations to the city through the council

22:19.415 --> 22:32.092
and the commission regarding the location of 
activities. Sure. And I think that role is

22:33.018 --> 22:42.887
constant in the evolution and the assistance and 
the preparation of the plan, the staffing of the

22:33.018 --> 22:42.887
regulations, the staffing of the... I mean, it 
never ends there. It's bound to be. But what we

22:45.069 --> 23:00.182
have, if we have a planning system that's 
theoretically perfect, is what I'm talking

22:45.069 --> 23:00.182
about, we have that impermanent constitution 
that planning has always been alleged to be. It's

23:00.783 --> 23:02.164
that backdrop against... Make the decisions in 
relationship to your plan. This plan is what it is

23:06.410 --> 23:08.973
today. It's going to change. Economic conditions 
are going to change. ITEs are going to change. Cars

23:14.439 --> 23:15.540
are going to change. Travel patterns are going to 
change. We can change the plan. And we can change

23:19.924 --> 23:27.953
the plan consistently to respond to public policy 
by the vote of the council to change that plan. Do

23:27.973 --> 23:30.075
you have in mind, after adoption, and you go into 
the next phase after adoption, do you have in mind

23:31.118 --> 23:37.107
anything like annual review and update? 
Absolutely. As a matter of fact, our charter

23:37.588 --> 23:54.593
stipulates that there will be, didn't set the 
period, but they said there'll be

23:37.588 --> 23:54.593
monitoring and at least, I think it says in there, 
five-year periodic major review. Yeah, that's

23:54.753 --> 23:56.215
excellent. We had in Florida, in the Breyer County 
system, we had a system of one-year plan

23:57.089 --> 24:02.476
amendments. If your zoning wasn't consistent, 
you got denied. You could file for a plan amendment

24:06.963 --> 24:10.307
and wait for it to cycle up. And what you did is we 
took large planning areas, got all plan

24:10.327 --> 24:24.747
amendments in, held one staff report public 
hearing on all of those, and you amended the plan at

24:10.327 --> 24:24.747
one time or didn't amend it or didn't. But it was 
done in a comprehensive basis. We have weekly

24:26.536 --> 24:29.060
rezonings in College State. Oh, I know that. But 
that's because zoning is planning in Texas. You

24:32.044 --> 24:32.665
know what I mean? Oh, of course I know. What I wanted 
to ask you, what would be a neat trick would be if you

24:35.169 --> 24:53.556
could schedule those annual updates so that they 
would be ready and completed in time for the city

24:35.169 --> 24:53.556
manager to use them as a basis for formulating his 
annual budget. Oh, no question about it. As a

24:54.994 --> 25:03.765
matter of fact, we've already talked about 
linking our annexation program, our capital

24:54.994 --> 25:03.765
budgeting program, backing it all up in the 
process. So all these things happen prior to the

25:03.785 --> 25:07.370
operating budget cycle. I mean, there's so much 
depending upon that. Then that would put planning

25:09.953 --> 25:13.217
in a leadership role. Well, it certainly... 
Rather than a reactive role. Absolutely. It would

25:18.504 --> 25:21.147
put it at the right arm of... municipal management 
in an intelligent management function where it

25:21.329 --> 25:25.554
should be. Right. Part of a city administration. 
Not just another line operation down there to

25:28.759 --> 25:32.263
implement something. Well, I think that the tie 
between city administration and city planning is

25:32.283 --> 25:40.193
long overdue to be strengthened. And managers, if 
they have a good planning director who is

25:40.393 --> 25:46.341
sympathetic to this as well, can realize that 
planning can be an enormous tool for it. I know. You

25:51.958 --> 25:56.584
hear that said by city managers every time they 
speak at conferences. But you don't hear city

25:56.725 --> 26:00.590
managers speak like that to city managers at the 
ICMA conference. You don't. City managers are

26:01.391 --> 26:04.495
politically pragmatic beasts. They know where. 
the zoning case is, and they know who owns the land,

26:06.183 --> 26:11.390
and they live in that arena of politics. And in 
short range. And it's just as short range as the

26:12.631 --> 26:16.135
people who hire them. And the planter forever is 
caught in a box, in my opinion, except I've had the

26:17.197 --> 26:29.372
rare privilege of working for a few city managers 
that do meet the mold. Well, Lloyd Cookingham in

26:29.858 --> 26:42.158
Kansas City was probably the best example of a city 
manager that understood the potential

26:29.858 --> 26:42.158
relationship between the planning process and 
city management. But there aren't a whole lot of

26:42.178 --> 26:44.342
Cookinghams around. Yeah. Well, I totally agree.

26:51.894 --> 26:56.642
Norman, the timing on the Austin Plan project. 
Would you go through the major points in time you

26:57.010 --> 27:01.614
anticipated? Sure. It was a consciously 
conceived program designed to take

27:01.814 --> 27:07.960
approximately two years. It took about six months 
longer to get initiated than we had planned on

27:09.741 --> 27:26.376
because of change in council election, the whole 
timing of the thing, and the need for the new

27:09.741 --> 27:26.376
council to just get up to speed with their job 
before they got on with it. the process of

27:28.297 --> 27:29.899
appointments. Council elections came in the 
middle of trying to get this process started. So it

27:34.364 --> 27:52.365
wasn't until almost a year after council 
elections in 85 that they finished all the

27:34.364 --> 27:52.365
appointments and we officially kicked the 
process off with a big meeting out at one of the

27:34.364 --> 27:52.365
hotels and started all that formal deliberation. 
We're now... Has the change in the council had any

27:52.405 --> 27:57.291
consequences for the program? Only that hiatus, 
slow down period, it put it behind schedule in my

27:58.199 --> 28:07.870
mind, probably six months. But

28:07.970 --> 28:25.590
you have, in my opinion, you have to give a lot more 
credit than people are willing to do to the

28:07.970 --> 28:25.590
original Mullen Council, the perceived 
developer controlled council, in which all of

28:07.970 --> 28:25.590
this took place. Northwest Plan, the Charter 
Amendment. A lot of things took place in an era

28:29.985 --> 28:40.140
under a council that was perceived to be 
anti-neighborhood, pro-development. Some

28:40.160 --> 28:49.053
people say, well, they were just doing that 
because of the enormous visibility in the

28:40.160 --> 28:49.053
upcoming elections. They were playing to the 
pro-planning neighborhood mood and then got

28:49.093 --> 28:54.081
swept out of office anyway. I don't know whether 
that's true, but... The new council is not, well,

28:56.468 --> 29:13.627
it just took longer to get up to speed with them, and 
they are so slow to make decisions, I mean, any

28:56.468 --> 29:13.627
decision out there, so it's a different council, 
but still it's a very supportive council, I mean,

28:56.468 --> 29:13.627
to say that. Anyway, we're about nine months into 
the process. I've alluded to the structure of

29:17.472 --> 29:22.898
appointees and task groups supported by staff, 
the relevant departments, planning's lead

29:24.008 --> 29:31.537
agency, and all these various elements groups.

29:32.918 --> 29:37.163
We have a definite process that results in three 
milestone reports. The first milestone is

29:38.725 --> 29:47.856
basically, and all groups are through that 
process now, is basically an issue definition.

29:49.068 --> 29:53.415
You have to understand, we've got the developers 
and the environmentalists and the Hispanics and

29:49.068 --> 29:53.415
the blacks. We've got all the communities sitting 
there trying to figure out what's common, what's

29:53.455 --> 30:07.739
good, what's bad, and come up with eventually the 
goals and policies in a consensus-making

29:53.455 --> 30:07.739
process. Is this report available now? reports 
that thick. I mean, just tons of them. We don't tell

30:14.063 --> 30:14.824
you. You get buried trying to read all of them. It's 
not important for this project or my project. So

30:23.192 --> 30:27.776
the first milestone is basically a process of 
getting people to work together. We have

30:27.816 --> 30:35.163
facilitators, professional facilitators who 
live in Austin, volunteer services, tons. I mean,

30:35.223 --> 30:36.244
night meetings. You know the process is night 
meetings out at the wazoo. So the first several

30:41.093 --> 30:58.019
months was a getting to know each other, getting 
testing ground among the battling constituent

30:41.093 --> 30:58.019
groups, a beginning to deal with what do you think 
the problems of Austin are. The second milestone,

30:58.400 --> 31:05.971
which they're all beginning to approach now, 
deals with the definition of these are our values.

31:06.272 --> 31:08.535
The first milestone was issues and values. trying 
to get them to focus. Now, what are our goals and

31:11.531 --> 31:17.097
objectives and probable ways to implement those? 
Each one of these kind of bleeds across. You can

31:19.600 --> 31:22.884
finish it if you can get there, or you can carry it 
over. So now we're beginning to take those values

31:24.405 --> 31:35.738
and problems and define their goal sets, what they 
think Austin's vision ought to be, and all this

31:24.405 --> 31:35.738
kind of thing. move as far down that goals, 
policies, objectives, and standards as they can.

31:42.445 --> 31:44.048
You've got a housing task group doing this. You've 
got water and wastewater. You've got all the

31:45.230 --> 31:53.605
element groups, all dealing with this public 
policy and decision consensus piece up front.

31:53.625 --> 32:00.156
Then when they get through that process, they'll 
go to milestone three, which is implementation.

32:00.980 --> 32:25.165
techniques and strategies and ordinance 
requirements and the teeth of all that you'll have

32:00.980 --> 32:25.165
basically a whole superstructure of consensus 
agreement about issues values goals policies

32:00.980 --> 32:25.165
objectives standards and the tools and of course 
you got a land use group doing you know their piece

32:00.980 --> 32:25.165
on this evolving this consensus of austin's 
vision of what they want this city to be, how they

32:25.820 --> 32:30.266
wanted to get there, the standards that they want 
this city to be. You know, they'll cover all the

32:30.286 --> 32:33.831
issues. At that point, as they wrap up their 
individual third milestones, we take each of

32:33.851 --> 32:52.958
those elements, and they're staggered over three 
and four month periods, into the superstructure

32:33.851 --> 32:52.958
of the ordinance mandated by the Charter, the 
Comprehensive Plan Ordinance. And it'll be kind

32:53.275 --> 32:56.398
of a chapter by chapter thing. And we will adopt the 
housing component of the plan. And then we'll

33:01.103 --> 33:03.606
adopt whatever else comes on stream. All designed 
to be an interim document. All the

33:07.990 --> 33:11.054
interdependencies, just like any other 
ordinance. If wastewater comes on and says, you

33:11.234 --> 33:19.182
got something there that doesn't work, we work it 
out and then we adopt it. Two of them updated. We

33:20.774 --> 33:23.597
strike old language, so both those are 
compatible. Internal consistency piece. And

33:26.020 --> 33:32.447
every element comes on and is adjudicated to be... 
And finally you come out with this plan. This is a

33:32.787 --> 33:34.409
first test. But you'll go through a series of 
interim element adoptions. And then this will

33:39.274 --> 33:42.518
eventually yield the comprehensive plan. The 
final total plan. With plan diagrams and all that.

33:45.221 --> 33:47.143
Yes, and you will have the birth. of the 
comprehensive plan. And you know from there it's

33:48.957 --> 33:56.669
annual revisions, articulations, refinements, 
changes, and modifications. At least we have that

33:56.809 --> 34:00.074
coherent document to start with. So that you're 
really, when you say an interim plan element is

34:00.094 --> 34:10.009
going to be adopted, I think if I'm interpreting 
this correctly, what this means then is that what

34:10.394 --> 34:20.383
you're doing is it's sort of like a sketch plan, and 
you're going to use this for testing and

34:10.394 --> 34:20.383
adjustment with other elements so that it can be 
brought into balance. And then all of those then

34:20.463 --> 34:25.948
would, you're not really going into piecemeal 
adoption as such. Well, there's some debates

34:26.188 --> 34:29.611
whether if that might happen. It might happen more 
in terms of adopting a sectors land use plan. You

34:36.798 --> 34:38.359
better talk to Alfred Bettman. He'll have some 
things to say about that, and so would Ladislaus

34:40.702 --> 34:44.728
Segal. I understand that. But this is based upon 
Austin's traditional bias for action. Unquote.

34:54.582 --> 35:00.811
But, Norman, still one could say, I think... It's 
not inconceivable that you could do a housing

35:01.071 --> 35:03.975
element

35:06.858 --> 35:11.528
with goals and policies and objectives and 
standards and implementation programs that

35:06.858 --> 35:11.528
could be adopted. There's not a lot that will not 
have happened in all the interdependencies and

35:12.730 --> 35:20.145
internal consistency of time they get there to 
preclude that from happening. Some of the more

35:21.488 --> 35:26.959
intricate ones, land use to transportation, land 
use to water, some of the superstructure things,

35:27.327 --> 35:28.629
probably can't just be done in a bag. That's what I 
was going to say. I think that your three mandated

35:29.730 --> 35:35.057
elements probably would have to be adopted 
simultaneously. Oh, no question. And also, the

35:36.659 --> 35:45.351
whole process was designed to bring on land use, 
housing, and infrastructure. That's an

35:45.391 --> 35:46.813
important thing to understand. Sure. And the 
process of who got started when has to do with that.

35:51.459 --> 35:51.799
Oh, yeah. Of course, and then, of course, if you 
were on the Gulf, you could have a port element or

35:52.437 --> 35:59.824
whatever, but that could come years later. Sure, 
absolutely. And it could come about as political

36:00.585 --> 36:03.487
pressures generated. Absolutely, and our 
charter provides that. Well, in that sense, it

36:06.570 --> 36:14.358
could be piecemeal, and in that sense, it could be 
very realistic in terms of relating or planning to

36:06.570 --> 36:14.358
the decision process. Well, I think it's very 
interesting, and I certainly wish you a whole

36:15.959 --> 36:22.225
bunch of success on it. Well, we need a whole bunch 
of support now. It's a novel thing. Try to attempt

36:29.913 --> 36:32.175
this. Well, Austin is a tough city for planners. 
Unlike any place I've ever worked in 22 years, it is

36:37.261 --> 36:45.551
novel, to say the least.

36:45.571 --> 36:47.233
Are there any other things you would Well, did we 
ever get to the end of when the comprehensive plan

36:47.956 --> 36:53.803
might be adopted? The mandate in the mission 
statement given to this community participation

36:54.063 --> 37:07.099
group was to have a plan for adoption by within 24 
months, which puts it out in like February, March

36:54.063 --> 37:07.099
of 88.

37:10.303 --> 37:11.905
And right now, Unbelievable. We're on schedule. 
We had this thing purged out, and we're on

37:14.684 --> 37:20.592
schedule, relatively speaking. Of course, we 
haven't got to any real tough inter-group

37:20.612 --> 37:32.648
conflicts yet, because it's all still been at the 
pretty general theoretical testing level. I

37:32.668 --> 37:36.053
think that two years for the formulation of a Any 
comprehensive plan, let alone something that has

37:36.387 --> 37:44.696
a lot of new approaches in it, is probably minimum. 
Oh, I guarantee you it's minimum. I was one of

37:47.139 --> 37:48.660
three. Yeah, I would be more comfortable with 
three. But pragmatic politics and a city manager

37:51.724 --> 37:56.369
and others said no way. And that's always there. 
Yeah. But the manager is very protective, I hope,

38:01.784 --> 38:11.176
of the comprehensive planning process and not 
getting it mixed up with day-to-day planning.

38:11.377 --> 38:16.664
Yes, and actually the organization of the two 
departments is by that very design. The

38:16.684 --> 38:25.195
day-to-day stuff, the zoning, the regulatory, 
the site plans, the building permits and all that

38:16.684 --> 38:25.195
are all over the land development services and all 
that kind of stuff. We're over here doing the plan.

38:28.548 --> 38:48.497
annexation we've got some routine stuff and 
basically the whole man-based information

38:28.548 --> 38:48.497
system multi-departmental computer operation i 
think it's interesting that you're physically at

38:28.548 --> 38:48.497
some distance from the rest of the city well it's 
not by desire but There's no city hall building

38:49.000 --> 38:54.105
that, you know, there's just not a capability to 
put people together. We've got pretty quality

38:54.886 --> 38:56.267
space. Actually, I like being removed from the 
hectics of that process. There are real needs for

39:02.794 --> 39:05.877
us to talk daily, and we do. Jim Duncan and I. This 
process would not work if there weren't two people

39:07.198 --> 39:16.628
as compatible as Jim Duncan and I running current 
and long-range planning, in fact. because so much

39:17.654 --> 39:22.321
of what they do has to just do this eventually. And 
if you had two competing egos about philosophies

39:22.341 --> 39:33.638
that didn't go down the same track, I mean, it's bad 
enough to work with the various departments and

39:22.341 --> 39:33.638
