00:02.765 --> 00:08.272
Actually, it has gotten some very interesting 
reviews. There was a book published. I was trying

00:11.416 --> 00:12.297
to think. It was Lexington or Heath. I can't 
remember publishers that had a chapter in it

00:13.579 --> 00:21.448
dealing with MOPAC and citizen conflicts with 
local governments. And I'm not sure he did a real

00:22.470 --> 00:25.033
good job. But I have a friend who will go nameless 
that's with the highway department. And... And I

00:33.224 --> 00:43.014
will go so far as to say that they have done a major 
analysis of Mopac and land use impacts and change

00:33.224 --> 00:43.014
and traced it historically. And they cannot find 
where Mopac, per se, has had any substantial

00:43.534 --> 00:48.760
impact on the surrounding neighborhoods. Now, 
there are two reasons for this, and they were

00:49.360 --> 00:53.284
design factors built into the freeway. One is 
there's no access road. And so not only is there no

00:56.247 --> 01:01.172
access road, but

01:03.818 --> 01:33.572
Interestingly

01:03.818 --> 01:33.572
enough,

01:03.818 --> 01:33.572
my friend who did this study, which has not been 
released and may never see the light of day, found

01:03.818 --> 01:33.572
that the expressway itself did not make any 
substantial impacts in terms of land use patterns

01:03.818 --> 01:33.572
or changes. that, in fact, it tended to verify what 
was already happening. There was already a

01:38.312 --> 01:43.557
conversion process going on in the area. 
Conversion from what to what? Well, basically

01:45.019 --> 01:55.849
from single family houses to some corner stores, 
markets, to small apartments, six, eight unit

01:45.019 --> 01:55.849
townhouse apartments. And part of this reflects 
the fact that Mopac extends past, essentially,

01:56.229 --> 02:03.036
the west fringe of the University of Texas, which 
logically was an area for redevelopment at higher

02:03.320 --> 02:11.914
intensity and density, that zoning had well 
preceded the redevelopment. In many cases, the

02:11.954 --> 02:19.366
redevelopment was occurring prior to any 
publication of the plans to build Mopac. And in

02:20.407 --> 02:29.682
fact, interestingly enough, since Mopac's been 
built up and been open, the conversion process has

02:20.407 --> 02:29.682
slowed down. It was really a reflection of 
something that had already happened. Now,

02:35.040 --> 02:41.390
because there was no access road built on Mopac, 
this limited any potential for strip

02:35.040 --> 02:41.390
development. You know, it's really the way all 
urban freeways ought to be built. I don't know if

02:44.014 --> 02:52.187
you've ever tried to get on Mopac, but if you don't 
know where the entry ramp is, you might drive all

02:44.014 --> 02:52.187
the way back to the river before you can get on. I've 
done it once or twice. It's kind of frustrating.

02:55.171 --> 02:55.933
It's a planner, even. Yes. Well, you know, that 
happens. Did it get lost in Austin? Not very often.

03:05.413 --> 03:12.200
So you wind up with an expressway that has limited 
access, that's infrequent, and it's hard to get

03:05.413 --> 03:12.200
on, and it has no service road. And so it doesn't 
really have the level of community impact. Now, it

03:15.464 --> 03:18.407
did separate some neighborhoods, and I won't deny 
that. A lot of the area it went through was state

03:19.248 --> 03:25.755
land to begin with, reservations, National Guard 
posts, and so forth. So Camp Mayberry. And so, you

03:28.825 --> 03:31.228
know, a lot of things that happened. Now, it did 
tend to stimulate some development on the north

03:31.248 --> 03:39.317
end at 183, where some of the interchanges are, but 
that would be expected. Also, development was

03:40.338 --> 03:43.421
occurring in that direction in any case. Mopac 
certainly reinforced that. Now, when it comes to

03:47.225 --> 03:55.795
the south section of Mopac, something else 
entirely happened in the way it impacted South

03:47.225 --> 03:55.795
Austin. because all of the methods of getting into 
North Austin from South Austin are terrible,

03:56.247 --> 04:25.039
suddenly the prospect of having a major 
underutilized freeway open, which could take you

03:56.247 --> 04:25.039
from South Austin, from a very desirable area to 
live in, in terms of scenery and terrain, very

03:56.247 --> 04:25.039
close into downtown, very close into the state 
bureaucratic headquarters, very close into the

03:56.247 --> 04:25.039
Capitol, and very close to the University of 
Texas, on roads that essentially do not carry the

04:25.711 --> 04:34.101
traffic that they are capable of carrying, 
creates a tremendous potential for development

04:25.711 --> 04:34.101
in southwest Austin. Furthermore, a certain 
nameless individual looks at this and sees an

04:35.162 --> 04:48.537
opportunity for building perhaps the largest 
shopping mall in Travis County. You don't want to

04:49.338 --> 04:50.619
name him? Well, we don't want to name everybody. 
Well, he was a real estate agent who happened to be

04:54.179 --> 05:01.170
on the planning commission at the time and voted 
for the zoning change. And then sold the land based

05:03.333 --> 05:06.878
on the contingency of the zoning change. A little 
conflict of interest. Shortly after that, there

05:10.224 --> 05:16.774
was an ethics thing passed by the city. It sounds 
like the last high rise in La Jolla. Yeah. So...

05:21.820 --> 05:24.002
moving right along past other little things. But 
we see this tremendous shopping center with a

05:24.302 --> 05:46.204
tremendously large parking lot being built on top 
of an area that is going to drain into Barton Creek,

05:24.302 --> 05:46.204
which feeds into Barton Pool and Barton Springs, 
which is one of the very traditional ancient areas

05:24.302 --> 05:46.204
of Austin that the city holds in reverence. It's a 
shrine, really, to the kind of character of the

05:46.304 --> 05:49.988
city. Totally unpolluted spring water. It 
doesn't have to be chlorinated. People can go

05:53.989 --> 05:55.210
swimming in it. It's rather chilly, but at the same 
time, you know, beautiful sloping area, grass

05:56.051 --> 06:02.798
covered, going down to a natural pool. Well, here 
we have this tremendous shopping center with all

06:03.519 --> 06:13.049
the urban runoff, pollutants, oil, and 
everything else that's going to work its way down

06:03.519 --> 06:13.049
into there. It spurs all kinds of residential 
development with the usual fertilizers,

06:13.510 --> 06:19.536
pesticides, herbicides, leaking sewer pipes and 
whatnot, and people get very excited.

06:25.847 --> 06:28.950
Furthermore, it's on top of the Edwards Aquifer 
recharge zone. Well, the problem from the real

06:29.951 --> 06:42.783
estate agent's viewpoint, the developer's 
standpoint, is they had found out about all this,

06:29.951 --> 06:42.783
as they do when the plans are proposed and made 
public, and they go down and slowly begin to build

06:29.951 --> 06:42.783
up their land bank. This is where they're going to 
build, beginning in the late 70s through the 80s.

06:50.667 --> 06:59.480
Well, some of the developers said Barton Creek is 
going to be a real nightmare because it's so

06:50.667 --> 06:59.480
politically sacrosanct, so we'll go down to the 
next creek, Williamson Creek Watershed. Again,

07:00.462 --> 07:04.388
Edwards Aquifer, same pollutant problems, 
runoff problems. And this is where the commitment

07:05.189 --> 07:16.947
has been made by developers, the financial 
interest of the community, the bankers, that

07:05.189 --> 07:16.947
future development on large scale is going to 
occur. Williamson. Well, Williamson Creek and

07:18.494 --> 07:22.918
Barton Creek watershed, basically southwest 
Austin. And the outcome, of course, of all of that

07:23.679 --> 07:33.609
is that now people are beginning to be a lot more 
environmentally aware. Certainly in Austin, we

07:33.649 --> 07:44.479
have perhaps more civic organizations 
associated with environmental issues here per

07:33.649 --> 07:44.479
capita than any place else in the world that don't 
like this. Well, here the investment's been made.

07:47.654 --> 07:49.016
The speculation's been made. There are financial 
commitments that have been made. The land is

07:51.120 --> 07:59.012
generally, in many cases, either within the city 
limits, and you've got to allow them to do

07:51.120 --> 07:59.012
something or you've got to buy it. And they figured 
out a few years ago that simply buying the Barton

07:59.814 --> 08:14.978
Creek floodplain, the creek itself and the 
adjacent land to it, not the entire drainage area,

07:59.814 --> 08:14.978
would run somewhere in the vicinity of $125 
million. Well, $125 million for the city of Austin

08:15.599 --> 08:26.692
is a massive development just to protect the 
bottom of the creek, when in fact you have to

08:15.599 --> 08:26.692
control the slopes and sides and the watershed to 
protect it. Well, that's an economic

08:28.133 --> 08:31.517
infeasibility. It just cannot be done. Now, so 
here's the kind of massive problems that you're

08:35.082 --> 08:40.288
facing. Others have spoken of the southwest 
corridor. in a kind of a vague way on tape, and I

08:43.628 --> 08:49.513
haven't quite understood what they meant. Well, 
the problem is you're moving into a recharge zone

08:50.214 --> 08:57.840
with some difficulties in terms of servicing. 
It's going to be costly to service. It's this hilly

08:59.541 --> 09:00.602
terrain. And the outcome beyond that is that if you 
look around, there are a lot of areas in Austin that

09:01.743 --> 09:12.472
have problems of tremendous nature. For example, 
the East Austin area, east of the interstate,

09:13.801 --> 09:29.486
where most of the black, or I shouldn't say most, a 
large percentage of the black population

09:13.801 --> 09:29.486
resides, heavily black populated 
neighborhoods, is suffering terrible housing

09:13.801 --> 09:29.486
problems over there. The deteriorated figures 
are running over 50%. There is absolutely no

09:35.916 --> 09:41.665
economic investment, no incentive, There was a 
bank established not too many years ago just right

09:42.573 --> 09:50.221
next to the interstate with the idea that it would 
service the area, be committed to it. Well, it gave

09:50.742 --> 09:55.326
up this past year and moved to the other side of the 
interstate. Symbolically, they could not remain

09:55.346 --> 09:59.250
in that community. There is no investment in that 
area. It's blighted. It's deteriorating. And

10:05.137 --> 10:07.399
it's got to the point that if I was in a position to 
say something one way or the other, I would be

10:07.767 --> 10:17.380
saying, let's get the most vigorous code 
enforcement program we can in there and tear down

10:07.767 --> 10:17.380
every house and building we can. And hopefully 
create a widely devastated area that's vacant so

10:18.201 --> 10:25.691
that we can hopefully rebuild. Because it's to the 
point that it's almost that hopeless. I'm not sure

10:28.795 --> 10:31.298
that we can do anything with that area. From a 
professional standpoint, that would have to be my

10:31.919 --> 10:37.707
recommendation, regardless of the social 
impacts. And my argument would be that people

10:37.720 --> 10:42.546
would be better off living elsewhere. Now, that's 
always a hard thing to say when there's some sense

10:42.586 --> 10:47.571
of viable community there in some of that area. So, 
you know, Austin has that as a problem. They've got

10:51.977 --> 10:54.219
a transportation problem that's acute. Their bus 
system is lousy. It falls off every chart I've ever

10:56.482 --> 11:01.948
seen in terms of level of acceptable service or 
service frequencies. You know, it's below poor.

11:03.710 --> 11:06.934
You know, it just doesn't exist on the charts 
during the day time. It's costly. It has no method

11:08.221 --> 11:10.543
of permanent funding. Every year they have to go in 
and battle taxes. And so

11:16.150 --> 11:32.127
the outcome is that with everything going up 
associated with transportation, energy, oil,

11:16.150 --> 11:32.127
tires,

11:16.150 --> 11:32.127
it's a mess. I don't see where the improvement is 
going to come from. committee here in town is

11:34.994 --> 11:38.058
committed to light rail. Well, light rail is 
wonderful. I would love to have a choo-choo train,

11:40.381 --> 11:50.513
too, but the land patterns of Austin are in no way 
amenable to it. The densities are wrong, and it

11:51.515 --> 11:58.243
gives you no flexibility whatsoever, and it's 
going to be extremely costly. Are we running out of

11:58.283 --> 12:00.746
time?

12:04.331 --> 12:04.731
And And I don't mean to imply that people aren't 
aware of these problems. For instance, they have

12:10.061 --> 12:18.400
initially lined up in the legislature this year 
the possibility or prospect of creating a transit

12:19.088 --> 12:22.576
district. This will be a bill that will be 
introduced during this legislative session,

12:23.959 --> 12:33.900
which allows the voters, by referendum, to 
establish a district. And it creates the enabling

12:33.920 --> 12:38.751
legislation for every city in the state of Texas of 
over 300 they're not sure how it'll be written, but

12:38.731 --> 12:45.498
probably over 350,000 population, to initiate a 
referendum. Well, this would be El Paso and

12:45.838 --> 12:48.021
Austin. And anything above. And anything above 
that wants to try again, like Dallas and Fort

12:51.024 --> 12:56.069
Worth, should they ever decide to try it again. And 
from all the literature, certainly the only way to

12:57.170 --> 13:06.780
solve the problem would be through... 
establishing a permanent trust fund through some

13:07.148 --> 13:17.546
taxing our transit district rather than having 
them to go and fight with the rest of the city for the

13:07.148 --> 13:17.546
budget. The rapid growth has created some 
problems in terms of recreation also in parks in

13:18.728 --> 13:28.245
the city of Austin and that is the parks department 
is having a I think, is a very effective department

13:28.546 --> 13:33.773
from what I've seen and what they're doing. And I 
think they've got the priorities right. But the

13:36.797 --> 13:47.251
outcome, of course, is that with the tremendously 
rapid growth, this creates tremendous demand and

13:36.797 --> 13:47.251
strain on their system, rapidly expanding 
system. At the same time, people are saying, let's

13:47.311 --> 13:49.955
hold down prices. Let's not increase taxes and so 
forth and so on. Well, that's not what they need

13:53.379 --> 13:56.123
either. So they've made the decision that 
essentially most of their money is going to be

13:56.103 --> 14:05.716
spent on purchasing of land and creating a land 
reserve for future development of parks. They

14:05.736 --> 14:09.901
know if they don't get the land today or in the near 
future, they're not going to get it. Well, you turn

14:11.063 --> 14:16.811
around, this means they're creating a rather 
large backlog of undeveloped parks. And in fact,

14:20.386 --> 14:29.160
We have at least one nice little linear park in 
South Austin that's supposed to tie into Town Lake

14:20.386 --> 14:29.160
that has never been developed. It's been on the 
city tax rolls or city park rolls now since the 40s,

14:29.961 --> 14:36.471
undeveloped. And this happens to run through a 
predominantly Mexican-American section of

14:36.923 --> 14:52.081
town, and this has become a focal point for an 
active community association to begin to focus

14:36.923 --> 14:52.081
some attention and some grievances on some 
problems that the city has managed to ignore. It's

14:53.563 --> 14:54.605
a typical thing. The squeaky wheel is going to get 
attention and create some improvements. So you

15:00.332 --> 15:02.374
begin with the problem of saying, well, we've got 
to do this for the long term. But on the other hand,

15:05.333 --> 15:08.796
we've got to solve some of these short range 
problems. And there's not money for both. And it

15:10.698 --> 15:13.321
creates a very complex situation. Austin is 
fortunate in that generally, the citizens have

15:13.701 --> 15:27.455
been willing to support bond issues at a level that 
I find very difficult to believe after I've worked

15:13.701 --> 15:27.455
and seen other communities operate. We did have a 
major bond proposal shot down, package shot down.

15:32.459 --> 15:34.101
as it was last year. But it was mainly tended to be a 
response to some growth issues and some concern

15:34.682 --> 15:44.534
over the direction of growth and where it was going 
to be located. Interestingly enough, things that

15:45.455 --> 16:02.415
the voters perceived as being needed and that did 
not have negative growth connotations,

15:45.455 --> 16:02.415
environmental impacts associated with them, 
like the parks package, the police package, the

15:45.455 --> 16:02.415
EMS package, the fire department package, were 
all funded. On things that failed were things like

16:02.699 --> 16:18.399
the sewer development plant, which included a 
major interceptor line running into a recharge

16:02.699 --> 16:18.399
area, a water line that would open up one of these 
sensitive areas for development that was part of a

16:02.699 --> 16:18.399
larger package. Well, the city is committed to 
developing those areas. People own the land. They

16:22.804 --> 16:24.066
have the right to develop. And with the wonderful 
municipal utility district laws of the state of

16:24.468 --> 16:43.017
Texas, if the city refuses to hook people up, 
ultimately they're going to be able to establish

16:24.468 --> 16:43.017
their own municipal utility district and build 
anyway. The problem is that the city of Austin

16:43.267 --> 16:48.934
really is not in a good position to say no. It cannot 
say no under the state law of Texas. It can slow you

16:52.299 --> 16:57.666
down and make your life miserable, but it cannot 
stop growth from occurring. It can make it more

16:57.966 --> 17:00.589
attractive in some other areas. Dick Lowy 
commented in much the same way on this point. And of

17:07.438 --> 17:10.422
course, it must be a source of tremendous 
frustration Oh, it is. The city is essentially

17:13.206 --> 17:34.317
left with the prospect of saying, well, we're 
either going to leave you on your own as a rural and

17:13.206 --> 17:34.317
incorporated subdivision with the prospect that 
you may at some time be brought into the city with an

17:13.206 --> 17:34.317
inadequate infrastructure and inadequate 
utility system, or else you're going to

17:35.528 --> 17:43.800
incorporate and form your own community within 
the geographic region and base of the city. One

17:44.371 --> 17:48.094
commitment the city of Austin has is not to allow 
that to happen. They look at Dallas, they look at

17:48.255 --> 18:04.129
even more substantially cities in the Northeast, 
and there is a commitment that the city of Austin,

17:48.255 --> 18:04.129
as it is growing, will maintain control over what 
it perceives to be its political and economic

17:48.255 --> 18:04.129
region. It will not allow a series of 
fractionalized rural communities and villages

18:04.149 --> 18:11.256
to grow up which will derive most of the sustenance 
from the city as a whole while not paying a

18:11.489 --> 18:21.144
reasonable share for the support of that city. And 
I don't think anybody politically in the city of

18:21.164 --> 18:26.532
Austin is going to take any other position. To a 
certain extent, certain neighborhoods and

18:28.255 --> 18:38.070
communities are beginning to have some qualms 
because they don't feel they're getting quite the

18:28.255 --> 18:38.070
level of service and attention as quickly as they 
should get. when there's a lot of money being

18:38.489 --> 18:41.825
pumped into these rural and outlying areas. But 
we've almost got ourselves in Austin to the point

18:42.408 --> 18:46.508
that we can't get off the horse. Because we have got 
ourselves committed in terms of funding

18:47.332 --> 18:53.819
programs, in terms of utilities. And for 
instance, we own our city electric system, which

18:54.100 --> 18:58.705
is a source of probably considerable comment. The 
county owns the hospital. And the county owns,

19:00.987 --> 19:03.190
well, we own the hospital. Oh, the city does. The 
city owns the hospital. That's a continuing

19:05.012 --> 19:07.234
source of political debate. Yeah. And 
essentially, we... are like New York, have our own

19:10.754 --> 19:18.226
welfare system in the city of Austin, and like 
everybody else in the world, because we own our

19:10.754 --> 19:18.226
hospital. And we supply to residents free medical 
care as necessary, which I don't argue with

19:18.827 --> 19:28.323
personally, but it's costly. It adds up. Well, in 
the case of the electric department, we are so

19:29.985 --> 19:35.935
overcommitted in terms of generation capacity. 
Particularly if new facilities come online, if we

19:40.344 --> 19:53.991
ever get South Texas Nuclear Project open and 
running ever, we will be so over committed in terms

19:40.344 --> 19:53.991
of generation capacity that if we don't grow, the 
cost of electricity is going to go up at over twice

19:54.815 --> 20:02.226
the rate of which we currently project the cost to 
go up. In other words, we're looking at, say, a

20:02.266 --> 20:07.934
continuing increase of about 6% a year, if I 
remember my numbers right. If we don't grow at a

20:08.315 --> 20:17.949
certain percentage rate that's been geared into 
this projection, we will trip up to about 10% a year

20:08.315 --> 20:17.949
increase, which gets pretty substantial. It's 
already high. And it's a very high rate as it is. So

20:21.694 --> 20:24.298
by continuing to grow, we're holding the ultimate 
cost of our electricity down. But if we don't grow,

20:28.366 --> 20:33.737
that means all of us that are here are going to have 
to pay more money in the future. And I don't know

20:34.278 --> 20:38.506
what the outcome of that is going to be, but it 
certainly seems... I think Lily mentioned

20:38.807 --> 20:43.697
selling, but Austin's currently selling 
electricity in Houston. Oh yes, we are. And we

20:45.929 --> 20:50.307
increased the cell contract to Houston. Houston 
is, in fact, paying us $18 million a year just for

20:50.388 --> 20:56.192
the right to buy electricity from us. That doesn't 
include the purchase of the electricity. That's

20:59.623 --> 21:06.109
just the right million and a half dollars a month 
just to be able to buy electricity, if they need it.

21:07.170 --> 21:13.276
And then they will pay premium price, maximum 
price, for the electricity we generate. And we'll

21:13.356 --> 21:20.403
sell the cheaper electricity we generate from our 
coal plant and the nuclear plant, ultimately, to

21:13.356 --> 21:20.403
the citizens. Well, this is one way to hold down 
that 6%. That pared it back down. you know again you

21:25.838 --> 21:54.428
know I'm not sure that that's necessarily a good 
way to go about making money um you know you

21:25.838 --> 21:54.428
certainly don't want to be in a position of not 
being able to have power and I certainly think that

21:25.838 --> 21:54.428
this is some of the decisions that we've made in 
regard to electrical energy are probably better

21:25.838 --> 21:54.428
ones because you know if you ever get behind and 
have to buy it you can uh you can be in the position of

21:25.838 --> 21:54.428
Houston paying somebody for the right to maybe buy 
it someday and Con Ed And New York faced that

21:55.657 --> 22:01.103
problem of having to buy electricity over a long 
period of time in large quantities. And the

22:01.143 --> 22:07.831
outcome was the system essentially went to a point 
of being bankrupt and having the highest electric

22:01.143 --> 22:07.831
rates in the US. Your former home state of Utah was 
entirely blacked out yesterday. Which is another

22:13.578 --> 22:18.103
good reason to show that we ought to be putting 
money into maintenance. And the point that a lot of

22:18.623 --> 22:28.681
people don't include is, what is the cost of that 
blackout in terms of lost work time, lost sales,

22:18.623 --> 22:28.681
equipment damage, accidents? And if you look at 
the social cost and consequences, just to the

22:29.363 --> 22:36.896
disruption of business, the cost is tremendous.

22:39.481 --> 22:41.745
They couldn't pump gas for police cars. Our 
ambulances are fire trucks, and your pumps go off

22:42.097 --> 22:49.289
for your water system, and suddenly you don't have 
water to fight fires. It goes on and on. So

22:51.032 --> 22:55.939
certainly that is something that we have to try. We 
have to have it, and we don't know what the answer to

22:56.000 --> 23:00.427
that issue is. In terms of opportunities...

23:07.612 --> 23:09.054
You know, Austin's growing. It's got a healthy 
economy. It's vigorous. We've got a tremendously

23:11.817 --> 23:16.383
educated and versatile population. Site-wise, 
it's well located climatically. It's not really

23:20.528 --> 23:22.230
that humid. And on the other hand, we're not quite 
as hot as Dallas in the summertime, and we're not

23:23.671 --> 23:33.984
quite as cold as them in the winter. Not quite as 
humid as College Station. Yeah. a little bit more

23:37.615 --> 23:39.877
pleasant all the way around. There's a lot of 
activities. State capitals are kind of a funny

23:43.961 --> 23:55.953
beast, per se, because they always seem to have a 
good stable economy because there's a large state

23:43.961 --> 23:55.953
bureaucracy located there that's, if not paid 
well, at least paid adequately. And you

23:56.974 --> 24:01.118
frequently see a major university there. We have 
the University of Texas here you know, some

24:04.497 --> 24:11.909
44,000, 45,000 students that are willing to work 
cheap and also a well-educated faculty and

24:04.497 --> 24:11.909
talented researchers. This brings a lot of 
culture and diversity into the community that a

24:12.631 --> 24:22.988
community this size would not otherwise have or 
would probably be paying through the nose in order

24:12.631 --> 24:22.988
to try to maintain a semblance of it.

24:26.193 --> 24:27.315
We have a lot of theaters, very good cultural 
facilities, good restaurants, a diverse

24:27.734 --> 24:36.762
population and ethnically, which I think adds to a 
community.

24:39.364 --> 24:47.532
So I'm not too concerned about the future of Austin 
as I might be about a lot of other communities.

24:48.112 --> 24:57.100
Well, I've heard it said by some people outside of 
Austin who know Austin rather well and may have

24:48.112 --> 24:57.100
lived here, in fact, in the past. that they feel 
that Austin should have stopped four years ago.

25:01.265 --> 25:03.388
Oh, well, yeah, everybody says that. They do. All 
right. Well, now, why do people say that? And why do

25:06.593 --> 25:13.262
they feel that what's being done now is contrary to 
the best interests of Austin? Oh, I think there's a

25:13.683 --> 25:18.910
lot of romanticism attached with when we were 
young. I think that people remember Austin from

25:20.813 --> 25:27.542
the time they went to the University of Texas here 
and what a good time it was. Indeed. And I think a lot

25:28.536 --> 25:33.540
of us look back at our undergraduate days and say, 
maybe that was the best time of my life. In many

25:33.640 --> 25:38.764
ways, I was young, healthy, and I really didn't 
realize all of the limitations I really have. Did

25:39.325 --> 25:40.426
you go to UT, also? No. I was wondering. No. But I 
appreciated the social life at Texas. Matter of

25:48.713 --> 25:52.496
fact, my junior year, I spent as much time over here 
as possible. I left Aggieland on weekends. There

25:54.998 --> 25:57.360
wasn't much to do that attracted me there. 
Difficult. Yes. But the outcome, of course, is

26:01.874 --> 26:08.023
that we remember the way things were and were 
attracted to it. In a lot of ways, Austin in the 50s

26:08.043 --> 26:25.069
and maybe the 60s

26:08.043 --> 26:25.069
probably was kind of the optimum as a community 
because if you're looking at a population, say,

26:08.043 --> 26:25.069
somewhere between 50,000, which it was in the 40s, 
running up to maybe 150,000 to 200,000, you really

26:25.319 --> 26:35.728
don't have some of the complex social problems 
that you have with a larger community. The taxes

26:36.269 --> 26:44.095
are generally quite moderate and low because you 
don't have the level and cross-section of demand

26:36.269 --> 26:44.095
of social structures and problems. The community 
wasn't growing. Its infrastructure was largely

26:46.057 --> 26:50.921
paid for. Its park system was developed and 
operating and adequate to its population. So we

26:55.880 --> 26:59.144
can look back at it and say, hey, that was a good 
balance. It had museums. It had reached perhaps

27:00.886 --> 27:09.396
the minimum level of critical mass to support an 
incredible variety of community services. Yes,

27:09.457 --> 27:15.624
and an incredible variety of recreational 
activities and restaurants. But at the same time,

27:16.105 --> 27:24.655
it hadn't got to the point that suddenly we really 
had to begin to pay for a lot of the additional costs

27:16.105 --> 27:24.655
that occur with growth. And the cedar is coming 
out. No, the cat. The cat. Oh. So the outcome, of

27:32.054 --> 27:40.181
course, is that a lot of us would look back and say, 
oh, wasn't that wonderful? That's what we really

27:40.202 --> 27:41.743
want. And we look back and say, gee, I could have 
managed to buy a house very reasonably, a very nice

27:41.763 --> 27:49.190
house. Today, you know, I can barely afford to pay 
my electric bill. Taxes are high. And so, and it's

27:55.178 --> 27:58.483
harder to get around. You know, today you cannot 
really drive around Austin that easily. Okay, so I

28:04.010 --> 28:10.519
think a lot of people will look back and they will 
pick some time in the past and say Austin should

28:04.010 --> 28:10.519
have stopped there. Now, some of the old timers 
should have said it's been like, you know, it's

28:11.200 --> 28:18.250
gone downhill since the GIs got back during World 
War II. World War II was the best time ever. All the

28:21.680 --> 28:24.566
students were gone, and it was decent for a change. 
You could drive through the University of Texas

28:24.606 --> 28:27.752
and get a parking place on campus. Incredible. 
Yeah, impossible.

28:34.326 --> 28:40.018
Probably the 50s and 60s, in many ways, were kind of 
a peak period for the city of Austin. There was a lot

28:40.859 --> 28:46.166
of self-confidence, and we weren't that 
sensitive to some of the problems that existed. It

28:47.348 --> 28:57.422
was no big deal that certain parts of Boston had 
flooding problems and that certain people didn't

28:47.348 --> 28:57.422
live very well or had very inadequate houses, or 
their incomes were extremely low. So I think a lot

28:58.403 --> 29:06.074
of the sensitivity that we're aware of in terms of 
our problems today, we just didn't have back then.

29:06.094 --> 29:07.896
But if we really look back at it, And for some 
people, it really wasn't that good a period. So

29:11.343 --> 29:15.210
there's a lot of trade-offs in every community. 
And I think that Austin is facing those today. In a

29:22.685 --> 29:24.408
way that they've never had in the past. In a way that 
they've never had to do in the past. This creates a

29:29.138 --> 29:31.401
lot of concern. There's a lot of people that feel 
like they're losing status and position. There's

29:35.967 --> 29:38.771
a much greater turmoil and changeover. You've got 
major industries coming into town that are

29:39.712 --> 29:48.944
beginning to employ people for, if not decent 
wages, at least certainly adequate wages. TI,

29:50.687 --> 29:56.074
Westinghouse, Motorola, IBM. or major employers 
in town. And they, although don't pay at the scale

29:58.683 --> 30:08.616
they do in St. California, they are certainly 
paying above what has been the tradition in the

29:58.683 --> 30:08.616
service industries associated with Austin. So, 
you know, you begin to see people having

30:10.639 --> 30:15.245
opportunities in Austin. It's not a matter of if 
you lose your job with the city or Texas University

30:15.825 --> 30:25.658
or the state bureaucracy that you're suddenly 
forced to necessarily leave town. Mm-hmm. There

30:26.547 --> 30:41.041
are many departments at Texas that are just 
frantic because they can't keep the people

30:26.547 --> 30:41.041
employed because the people were committed to 
living in Austin, but suddenly they find they can

30:26.547 --> 30:41.041
make what they're worth by going across the street 
to IBM. And this just distresses people that we

30:42.223 --> 30:47.528
can't maintain things the way they were. I think 
having more opportunities in many ways is better

30:48.008 --> 30:54.715
for Austin and its residents than, say, it was 
during the 50s and 60s. I would have taken a real

30:55.606 --> 31:00.712
financial beating to try to live here in the 50s or 
60s, I think, as compared to today. Not that I'm

31:01.393 --> 31:02.794
doing that well today. Well, who is at the 
university level? Yes. Kevin, thank you very much

31:06.498 --> 31:09.362
for your views on Austin. It will make a real 
contribution to the book, I'm sure. If anything

31:12.765 --> 31:19.533
else comes up, keep in touch, and we'll add it to the 
transcriptions. Appreciate it. Thank you.
