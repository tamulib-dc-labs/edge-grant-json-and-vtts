00:04.705 --> 00:09.171
You asked me some time ago if religion had an effect 
on my life. Really, it didn't. But in my last, I'm 66

00:10.252 --> 00:32.940
now, I'd say in my last probably 15, 20 years,

00:10.252 --> 00:32.940
I realized that there really is a God, and he has an 
influence on our life, and I pray to him. But you've

00:33.275 --> 00:37.059
become more religious now as you've become older. 
Yes. Why do you think that is?

00:41.924 --> 00:47.971
I think it's nothing more but experience, 
judgment, and more wisdom. I'm convinced older

00:49.373 --> 00:51.956
person gets more wisdom than he has. I think that 
makes sense. Sure. A lot of ways I think I'm smarter

00:55.279 --> 00:59.704
now than I was when I know I am.

01:07.092 --> 01:24.031
Going back to your original question, when I got 
out of high school and saw that I couldn't go to West

01:07.092 --> 01:24.031
Point, I

01:07.092 --> 01:24.031
thought, well, I'll take the written examination 
to the Flying Cadets. I know I can do this because of

01:24.051 --> 01:30.518
regulations at that time.

01:36.961 --> 01:50.798
I borrowed some books on some subjects that I had 
not been studying in the West Point Preparatory

01:36.961 --> 01:50.798
School in 1935 down at Fort Sam for the West Point 
Interest Exam. There were questions in physics,

01:50.858 --> 02:04.133
trigonometry, and one or two other subjects on the 
flying cadet examination that I hadn't been

01:50.858 --> 02:04.133
studying in my previous West Point Preparatory 
School in the United States Army. So I borrowed a

02:04.554 --> 02:06.276
book in physics. trigonometry, and on my own at 
home, started studying those subjects. And then

02:10.743 --> 02:27.140
when I went down to, I was one of 14 people, 
entrance, trying to get into flying cadets at that

02:10.743 --> 02:27.140
time, and went to Barksdale Air Force Base in 
Shreveport, Louisiana, to take a physical

02:10.743 --> 02:27.140
examination. I was only one out of 14 that passed a 
physical examination, with reservations in my

02:27.860 --> 02:36.229
case also, that I had to have my nose operated on to 
remove a crooked septum. And

02:42.966 --> 02:47.733
I got that done. They accepted me physically and 
then permitted me to take the written

02:47.753 --> 02:52.620
examination. And through the help of some of the 
instructors at Randolph Air Force Base, whom I had

02:53.902 --> 03:06.300
known in the military, in the West Point Prep 
School, at Fort Sam. I passed the examination and I

03:09.626 --> 03:21.218
think there I was about, I think it was about two or 
three out of about 15 or 20 that made that. So that

03:21.819 --> 03:23.260
made me real proud. And that put me in the flying 
cadets in March of 1938.

03:32.230 --> 03:35.393
And Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio. Okay, 
now tell me about the cadets. Is it basically

03:44.122 --> 03:48.126
training? Oh yes, training and teaching you to fly 
because I'm a pilot. It was a one year course, nine

03:51.949 --> 04:04.941
months at Randolph Air Force Base divided into 
primary and basic training where you soloed and

03:51.949 --> 04:04.941
then the next four and a half months you got a little 
bit more advanced airplanes. Then the last three

04:05.478 --> 04:17.578
months, you go over to Kelly Air Force Base, the 
other side of San Antonio, in those days, and take

04:05.478 --> 04:17.578
specialized courses either in bombing, attack, 
or pursuit or observation. It was called pursuit

04:17.598 --> 04:20.042
in those days, fighter today. I took fighters or 
pursuit. Why did you want to be a fighter pilot

04:22.706 --> 04:28.876
instead of bomber or observation? Well, I liked 
the glamour of it. Flying your own airplane,

04:31.297 --> 04:35.402
you're the only person in the airplane, and the 
acrobatics. It was

04:36.083 --> 04:40.148
fun. It appealed to me. Also, I developed in those 
days, just thinking about it, the idea that if I was

04:42.871 --> 05:00.493
in an airplane, I could control the airplane 
myself, and I could fire and shoot at another

04:42.871 --> 05:00.493
airplane, whereas if I was sitting in a bomber, 
Maybe I have to sit there and let them shoot at me and

05:00.592 --> 05:04.277
maybe take it. Sure. Fighters appealed to me. And 
the first chance I had at Randolph Air Force Base

05:09.183 --> 05:22.560
after I soloed, I had been taught to do slow rolls, 
shown how to do a slow roll by my instructor. But the

05:22.580 --> 05:27.065
first chance I had in flying an airplane by myself, 
I did a slow roll. I thought it was the greatest

05:27.086 --> 05:28.287
thing in the world.

05:34.477 --> 05:39.965
Now, in 1938, when you went to cadet school, then 
you went active duty, full-time military. Yes.

05:40.325 --> 05:41.327
That was the first time. I graduated from Kelly 
Field in February of 1939. And incidentally,

05:48.557 --> 05:55.647
there I flew the key slot of the entire graduating 
class in formation. Number two man on the lead

05:55.667 --> 05:59.432
instructor. I'm real proud of that. Again, I 
turned out to be an A student

06:06.522 --> 06:12.689
And then upon graduation, we were assigned to our 
first tactical unit. And upon graduation, is that

06:12.889 --> 06:16.113
when you received the permission? I became a 
second lieutenant reserve in a Army Air Corps,

06:16.153 --> 06:22.921
United States Army Air Corps. That's in 1939, when 
you received your first assignment, which was at

06:22.941 --> 06:31.691
Langley Field in Virginia. Right, second bomb 
group. And of all things, they put me in bombers.

06:36.678 --> 06:38.520
Yeah, I don't understand that. I've often asked 
that question. I think there were 17 of us in my

06:41.404 --> 06:58.063
graduating class that went to

06:41.404 --> 06:58.063
Langley Field, and at Langley Field there was an 
aid pursuit group and a second bomb group, and they

06:41.404 --> 06:58.063
had to divide us up, of course. Well, I think they 
did alphabetically, and they took the top ones and

06:58.083 --> 07:03.850
put them in bombers. That's the only way I can 
figure it out. At any rate, I was put in

07:07.127 --> 07:14.356
bombardment, and looking back now, again, the 
good Lord may have been taking care of me. I don't

07:14.376 --> 07:14.696
know. Maybe it's fate, but the experience turned 
out to be worthwhile. I got some experience in

07:19.863 --> 07:22.366
B-17s. At that time, the Air Force only had 14 
B-17s, and I became a pilot of one of those

07:22.426 --> 07:30.236
airplanes. That was unheard of in those days. You 
had to be seven feet tall, be... hundred years old

07:34.458 --> 07:37.302
to be a pilot, one of those things. And I got to go on 
one of the very few goodwill flights down to South

07:37.322 --> 07:43.391
America. Oh, did you? In November 1939 with 7B-17. 
Really, part of the good neighbor policy. Right,

07:50.180 --> 07:51.762
right. How did they brief you before you went down? 
What did they tell you? Oh, we went through, I guess

07:54.807 --> 08:00.575
it took six months to plan that trip. Mm-hmm. At the 
time, there was no such thing as airwaving or

08:01.120 --> 08:26.236
anything, but we used Pan American Airlines as 
sort of a forerunner, and used their experience,

08:01.120 --> 08:26.236
and, well, for instance, we had to fly over the 
Andes, you know, across from Peru to southern part

08:01.120 --> 08:26.236
of Brazil, and followed a route they had 
established. Pan Am really blazed the way for the

08:26.256 --> 08:28.900
trip. And incidentally, Kurt LeMay was the first 
lieutenant navigator for that flight, and I was

08:29.352 --> 08:38.740
his assistant operations officer. And tell me 
about him. Fantastic man. I knew the minute I met

08:42.003 --> 08:50.330
that man and worked with him that I knew one of these 
days he was going to be one of the greatest leaders

08:42.003 --> 08:50.330
in aviation. He was the same way as the first 
lieutenant that he was as four-star general. And

08:54.333 --> 08:55.834
what way was that? All business. He still had an 
understanding of people, and for some reason or

08:59.474 --> 09:17.171
other, I think the reason he took an interest in me 
is he saw my determination and dedication

08:59.474 --> 09:17.171
compared to my fellow second lieutenant that came 
to Langley Field. He was a first lieutenant? He was

09:18.372 --> 09:24.157
a first lieutenant, and I was a second lieutenant, 
of course, and he mainly took me under his wing. He

09:25.859 --> 09:27.500
was just such an operational officer. What kind of 
person was he? He

09:29.258 --> 09:38.271
wasn't a gregarious type, a social type. He was all 
business, smoked cigars then. Very much like you

09:43.479 --> 09:51.631
saw and have seen pictures and stories of him. 
Very, very much the same. Not near the iron-ass

09:54.556 --> 09:57.460
type. of a person in his heart, not near, in his 
heart, that people made him out to be. He was not, if

10:04.451 --> 10:07.695
you will, the son of a bitch that Patton was. He was 
not that type. But he was definitely a leader. He

10:14.745 --> 10:19.031
could do anything that he required you to do. And 
that impressed me. He could do it better. Anything

10:22.656 --> 10:25.219
he required you to do, If you couldn't do it, he'd 
show you how to do it. And this Danley, he trained as

10:28.954 --> 10:35.401
a fighter pilot, too, in his earlier days. So how 
was this trip with him? Oh, it was fantastic. As a

10:38.985 --> 10:45.752
matter of fact, Curt LeMay was one of the earlier 
officers I modeled myself after. Oh, really?

10:46.493 --> 10:47.354
Really, one of the earliest. I knew he was going to 
go places. So you sort of, he was your role model one

10:48.956 --> 10:52.219
night? Not exactly a model. I guess in those 
earlier days I didn't have a particular hero or a

10:53.691 --> 10:59.840
particular model, but I respected him less. I 
respected him more than I did my squadron

10:59.860 --> 11:04.728
commander.

11:06.630 --> 11:09.655
I respected competence in my superiors. I 
demanded it in my subordinates as I grew up in the

11:11.918 --> 11:19.590
military.

11:23.232 --> 11:25.955
But tell me about this trip. It was nothing in the 
world but a normal—in those days it was a

11:25.975 --> 11:31.060
spectacular trip. Sure. Four-engine bombers. 
How many bombers? We had five on that trip. That's

11:41.291 --> 11:48.919
that trip,

11:41.291 --> 11:48.919
right? We had some experiences on the trip that in 
those days were

11:49.945 --> 12:00.316
unusual, unexpected. First, you just didn't have 
an aircraft that would fly that far. Whoever heard

12:05.000 --> 12:15.531
of the United States Air Force, as you call it 
today, flying airplanes across the oceans around

12:05.000 --> 12:15.531
other countries? It was unusual in those days. In 
foreign countries, the arrangements you had to

12:17.705 --> 12:36.350
make,

12:17.705 --> 12:36.350
flying over the Andes at altitudes, flying over 
the Andes at 21,000 feet, puffing on a stick with

12:17.705 --> 12:36.350
oxygen in it, and still looking up above you at the 
peaks. Those things in those days you wouldn't

12:37.591 --> 12:39.814
forget. And having engines ice up, you know. The 
first time here, you know, that's the first

12:43.293 --> 12:46.957
experience high altitude flying. Twenty-one 
thousand feet, you know, gets unheard of those

12:48.598 --> 12:52.803
days. And then, of course— Were you afraid at the 
time? No. I can remember, I was a copilot on that

12:58.108 --> 13:09.379
flight for Dono, and my job was to keep those 
engines running. We had navigators do the

13:09.815 --> 13:11.497
navigation. My job was to keep the engines 
performing and using as little fuel as possible,

13:11.958 --> 13:18.027
and I loved it. And when the engines started icing 
up, I un-iced them. Just using the mixture

13:23.775 --> 13:29.964
control, possibly, and putting the carburetor 
heat on. Well-trained. I knew my job. That's the

13:32.067 --> 13:34.530
reason I was selected. I was a brand-new second 
lieutenant going with all these veterans. Did

13:39.768 --> 13:43.872
you lose any planes? No. As a matter of fact, we had 
some accidents. And of course, my particular

13:46.235 --> 13:56.346
aircraft crew was the ones that had some of the 
misfortunes. We lost a radio over the Andes on the

13:56.366 --> 14:06.737
way from Lima, Peru to Asuncion, Paraguay and got 
lost. And it got a little hairy then. I remember it

14:09.741 --> 14:11.363
got a little hairy then. How'd you find it?

14:17.269 --> 14:19.492
Matter of fact, we didn't find Asuncion Paraguay. 
We landed at Sao Paulo, Brazil,

14:19.572 --> 14:26.960
but flying, letting down over the water. You did it 
with a mountain, not knowing where we are. Then

14:29.103 --> 14:34.429
groping our way back to the coast and finding Sao 
Paulo, Brazil, and landing there. And then, the

14:35.017 --> 14:39.563
following day, the weather cleared, got a radio 
fixed, we went on on to Susquehanna Paraguay.

14:41.525 --> 14:47.153
Then, of course, we came up to Rio de Janeiro, won 
the airplane, got in mud, lost props. On the way

14:48.895 --> 15:02.572
back, last leg from Curacao, Venezuela, on the way 
to Langley, we lost number three engine and had to

14:48.895 --> 15:02.572
go into Jacksonville. So again, we didn't. land 
and all the heroes welcome it by the field, but we

15:04.497 --> 15:08.422
finally got back. Tremendous experience. What 
did you learn from it? Well, what a four-engine

15:15.550 --> 15:25.502
bomber can do, particularly from a standpoint of 
transportation, not necessary bombings. And

15:25.622 --> 15:32.310
also, the impact that you can have in a show of force 
of military What was the impact, and how did you get

15:32.695 --> 15:37.041
along with the people in South America? We got 
along fine with them. Everybody was impressed

15:39.624 --> 15:43.689
with the air power. This was a forerunner of the air 
power of the United States. And we were at Old

15:47.954 --> 15:56.205
Kirtland, we later were at Ed Sack, and you know, 
calling it to the world.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.394
We were decorated by the President of Brazil. I was 
introduced to the diplomatic world for the first

16:01.035 --> 16:04.480
time. A young second lieutenant, old Charlie 
Bond, who came from nothing. Here I am in the

16:08.986 --> 16:15.295
capital of Rio de Janeiro, being honored by the 
President, and living on Copacabana Beach. Wow.

16:17.378 --> 16:19.782
Gee, eating it up, and given a medal. A blue medal 
over there, just for participating in that

16:21.965 --> 16:27.373
flight.

16:32.990 --> 16:43.624
And there's no doubt then that I knew that bombers 
were here to stay, transport aircraft,

16:32.990 --> 16:43.624
long-range aviation. I knew it was here to stay. 
But I still had love for fighters, and I still

16:45.206 --> 16:53.457
wanted to get in the 8th Pursuit Group right up the 
hangar line from us. Were there any problems

16:53.998 --> 16:57.883
whatsoever with the South Americans? I'm glad you 
asked that question. We've always had problems

16:59.549 --> 17:01.352
with South America. Well, ever since Teddy 
Roosevelt, we've had problems with South

17:01.372 --> 17:04.357
America. And the tension sometimes between 
America and the South American countries runs

17:05.098 --> 17:10.726
high. And I was wondering if there were, during New 
Deal and during the good neighbor policy of

17:10.747 --> 17:18.318
Roosevelt, he was trying to improve those 
relations. And was there tension? And this is one

17:20.101 --> 17:23.787
of the reasons we were making these flights. 
Right, yeah. Matter of fact, it was called a

17:24.368 --> 17:26.090
goodwill flight. Mm-hmm. And if you remember, 
after that, there were two or three of them made.

17:31.806 --> 17:33.568
And in fact, before that, there was one or two made. 
I was right in the middle of it. But that's one of the

17:36.112 --> 17:41.739
longest ones, and the most general one. As a matter 
of fact, it went all over South America. But I

17:44.503 --> 17:55.697
distinctly remember, and this is something I 
learned, I remember definitely the German

17:44.503 --> 17:55.697
influence in Brazil. Even in those days, 1939,

17:56.420 --> 18:01.446
was that right? November 1939. See, it was just 
before World War II. No, the war had just started.

18:05.752 --> 18:06.633
Yeah. Right. Right. But we weren't in it. No. The 
United States wasn't in it. No. But you could see

18:10.177 --> 18:17.146
the German training, the influence. I saw actual 
pictures of Hitler. Really? On walls of some of the

18:20.730 --> 18:25.937
buildings in Rio de Janeiro. Knowing now what I 
didn't know then, the effective military

18:26.356 --> 18:34.566
assistance group, you know, where you provide 
military aid, support. It was dominant,

18:34.967 --> 18:38.992
dominant, particularly in Brazil. Germans were 
ready to take over Brazil. And if you remember,

18:42.076 --> 18:48.303
when we did get into war, there was quite some naval 
activity up and down the Brazilian and Argentine.

18:48.383 --> 18:52.589
As a matter of fact, quite a naval battle right in 
the Argentine area. Looking back now, I could see

18:52.649 --> 18:55.232
it then developing. And we'll get to this later on, 
but subsequently on the way to China, the Flying

18:56.393 --> 19:16.709
Tigers in 1941, I saw the Japanese and the Dutch

18:56.393 --> 19:16.709
effects in the

18:56.393 --> 19:16.709
Indies. Surabaya Java gun emplacements, a new war 
was coming. I want to stick right here on this very

19:20.457 --> 19:27.465
interesting topic of the Germans there. You 
thought that the Germans were ready to take over in

19:27.505 --> 19:30.248
Brazil? Looking back now, I can see that they were 
moving in as countries do today. A perfect example

19:36.435 --> 19:45.065
is the way Russia has moved into Angola.

19:45.405 --> 19:48.068
Oh, Afghanistan, it's obvious. But the way they 
moved into Angola, the way they moved into

19:48.284 --> 19:57.056
Ethiopia, the way they moved into a lot of areas. 
The current experience in Central America

19:58.137 --> 20:04.646
through Cuba. Exactly. Exactly. Now how, back in 
1939, was your mission to try to combat this German

20:06.769 --> 20:13.238
influence? I'm sure that at the higher levels,

20:23.890 --> 20:25.712
Just like we're doing today amongst nations. Were 
you briefed before you went down there by State

20:25.792 --> 20:29.876
Department officials or anybody? Yes. As a matter 
of fact, a State Department official went with us

20:29.996 --> 20:35.482
in the form of General Matthew Ridgeway. Oh. He 
went with you? Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. I bet. And he was to

20:39.306 --> 20:46.454
advise the commander, General Andrews at that 
time. That's not his name. I'll think of it.

20:54.704 --> 21:02.793
He's a Brigadier General in charge of what they 
call the General Headquarters of the Army Air

20:54.704 --> 21:02.793
Corps in Langley Field.

21:06.137 --> 21:09.401
The name will come back to me in the transcript. 
I'll get this. You bet we were briefed. What did

21:13.806 --> 21:14.667
they tell you? Briefed on the conduct. Briefed on, 
as a matter of fact, we were briefed. I remember

21:18.291 --> 21:19.532
specifically. What did they say? What did the 
State Department officials tell you? Well, the

21:25.265 --> 21:30.352
State Department official was really advising 
the commander. He didn't make a talk to the

21:31.093 --> 21:48.998
crewman, but down a chain of command, we'd be told 
through our pilot of our crew, well, now look,

21:31.093 --> 21:48.998
we're going to this shindig tonight, and just be on 
your own, keep your mouth shut, observe, and then

21:31.093 --> 21:48.998
we'll talk about it later on.

21:53.063 --> 21:54.225
In Brazil, I think the real ultimate purpose of our 
trip was to try to impress the Brazilian

21:54.627 --> 22:06.564
government on the military capability. In other 
words, four engine bombers of the United States

22:06.585 --> 22:15.117
military, at that time Army

22:16.328 --> 22:19.571
Don't get locked in too much with the Germans. Here 
we have foreign military airplanes that are

22:19.591 --> 22:25.377
flying over your country from the United States 
right now. Show of force, looking back now, show of

22:25.397 --> 22:30.242
force is what we were doing. You follow me on show of 
force? Sure. Military, I'm sure you do. Well,

22:33.686 --> 22:36.749
that's what we were doing. Did it work? It was too 
late. Too late. See, this was November 39. Sure.

22:46.838 --> 22:49.280
Were the South Americans friendly toward you? 
Yes. As a matter of fact, you could see, looking

22:50.942 --> 23:00.150
back now, in South Park, Brazil, I remember part of 
the Brazilian Air Force. As a matter of fact, I have

23:00.170 --> 23:08.137
a picture of that gentleman someplace in

23:00.170 --> 23:08.137
my album. A very impressive, strictly 
oppression-type officer. He was commander in

23:14.583 --> 23:16.204
the... southern area of Brazil, the Air Force, and 
definitely oriented to the Germans. As a matter of

23:21.551 --> 23:38.513
fact, I remember references to pictures of Hitler 
in this, I think it was in the embassy,

23:21.551 --> 23:38.513
not the American embassy, but some public 
building where we were having this, you know, he

23:21.551 --> 23:38.513
was

23:44.078 --> 23:48.442
We were the one crew they gave a big shindig for. And 
looking back now, there's no doubt that group, the

23:48.462 --> 23:59.011
Brazilian airmen, they were oriented to Germany, 
no doubt. See, some of their aircraft, their

23:59.432 --> 24:03.956
equipment was German. Yeah, sure. I don't even, I 
can't remember. Frankly, I don't even know if we

24:07.359 --> 24:14.085
had, I'm sure we had a semblance of a foreign 
military

24:15.044 --> 24:22.211
policy, but there's no doubt that at that time, you 
know, Roosevelt was trying to make it stronger.

24:22.231 --> 24:22.871
Sure. Somewhat the way Reagan's trying to do 
today. Sure. What about the rest of the countries?

24:28.036 --> 24:30.578
I mean, how'd you get along with the people in those 
countries? Well, of course, we flew from Panama to

24:32.640 --> 24:41.929
Lima,

24:32.640 --> 24:41.929
Peru.

24:43.681 --> 24:49.827
In Panama, I don't recall really we'd grown an 
American air base there. I hardly even recall any

24:49.847 --> 24:54.010
Arabian children from Panamanian. But in Lima, 
Peru, definitely very cordial and that along

24:54.511 --> 25:00.997
fine. The German influence wasn't on the West 
Coast yet. But then when he crossed over into

25:07.323 --> 25:13.148
Asuncion, Paraguay, poverty-ridden country 
that was, I think, frankly, the only reason we

25:13.853 --> 25:28.934
stopped there is

25:13.853 --> 25:28.934
there was a logical place for refueling over the 
Andes, how to burn up fuel and all. And we were

25:29.655 --> 25:31.398
treated great. But in Rio, we were really wined and 
dined for the present on down. As a matter of fact,

25:39.723 --> 25:45.208
We took the president on my airplane in a formation 
flight over the bay of Rio de Janeiro. The

25:45.768 --> 25:48.391
president of Brazil was on our airplane. Where did 
he sit, up in a cockpit? He sat up in a cockpit. I got

25:50.933 --> 25:56.257
out of the co-pilot's cockpit, and he sat in my 
seat. I think it was impressive to him. As a matter

26:00.521 --> 26:03.123
of fact, I know it was, but it was too late. It's like 
some time today, we're too late. No, Ridgway. I

26:10.969 --> 26:16.816
never did really understand his, he was a general, 
Brigadier General Ridgway, I know that. I think

26:17.136 --> 26:24.225
what he was, was sort of head of the military 
intelligence. He was an Army general, not an Army

26:24.365 --> 26:27.949
Air Corps general. Terrific guy, by the way.

26:32.034 --> 26:35.818
And by the way, he's not the Ridgway that was in 
Korea, I don't think he is. No, the one that was

26:36.035 --> 26:38.078
certainly in the Philippines. That's not the same 
one. This man had to have connections with the

26:39.861 --> 26:43.967
intelligence agency. This is Matthew Ridgeway, 
though. No. No. Oh, that's what you said before.

26:47.934 --> 26:51.099
Did I say Matthew Ridgeway? Mm-hmm. I'd have to. 
Well, it's not the same Ridgeway. Oh, OK. Maybe I

26:53.903 --> 26:56.247
said Matthew because of the name. But it's not the 
same Ridgeway as the one in the Philippines or the

26:56.267 --> 27:02.617
great chief of staff. Yeah. You know, wait, I'm 
going to have to check that later on. This could

27:10.710 --> 27:12.652
have been the same one. Sure. I'm going to have to 
check that. I think it was. I said Matthew, didn't

27:18.620 --> 27:19.922
I? Yeah. Well, it must be. I'm not sure that's who it 
was, but I'll have to check this on you. fine on the

27:27.790 --> 27:29.111
transcript. What kind of man was he? You could 
never figure out what his job was. But he was

27:33.155 --> 27:35.276
definitely in the intelligence area. I am sure 
that man then was collecting information on the

27:35.697 --> 27:39.320
Germans. I'm sure he was. Did he ever discuss any of 
this with you? No, not with the second lieutenant.

27:46.967 --> 27:56.835
But even then, I knew in my lowly possession of a 
crew member and a brand new second lieutenant in

27:46.967 --> 27:56.835
the Air Force that

27:57.997 --> 28:05.064
This man had a definite mission, and he was always 
with the Brigadier General commanding the whole

27:57.997 --> 28:05.064
flight. He was always right up to his side.

28:11.191 --> 28:14.074
What kind of man was he? He was an impressive 
person, very diplomatic, strictly the diplomat

28:14.094 --> 28:24.865
type, not the military type.

28:26.971 --> 28:36.466
very gregarious, likable.

28:36.506 --> 28:40.212
As an Army general, I don't know how competent he 
was. He was just on our flight as a passenger. But he

28:42.936 --> 28:44.619
was easy to communicate with. Oh, yes. As a matter 
of fact, he was a perfect diplomat. I'm sure he was

28:49.346 --> 28:51.409
the diplomat for the flight. And he carried his own 
briefcase and papers. Now, tell me, after you

28:57.430 --> 29:03.979
returned, then what did you do with the bomber 
group? Well, after we returned, it was then, you

29:03.999 --> 29:18.079
know, see, this was in November 39, and we're 
approaching the year of 1940, and, you know, we're

29:03.999 --> 29:18.079
already, Europeans were already locked in 
combat, and there was a strange war over there at

29:03.999 --> 29:18.079
that time. Then, we began to see it, so we began to 
expand the Air Force. The second bomb group was

29:28.109 --> 29:32.054
split up and formed the Cadres for two groups. The 
newest one being established at MacDill Air Force

29:33.015 --> 29:43.789
Base in Tampa, Florida, and so happened the one I 
was reassigned to. I wanted to go with General

29:44.410 --> 29:55.804
LeMay, at that time Lieutenant LeMay, in another 
outfit that was going to spin off called an

29:44.410 --> 29:55.804
observation squadron, which that was later to be 
the so-called reconnaissance arm of the United

29:56.071 --> 30:01.940
States. And Colonel May went off in that area. You 
were asked to be with him? No. I was assigned at how,

30:08.850 --> 30:13.136
I don't know, but I was assigned to the 43rd Bomb 
Squadron. It was going to be at Tampa Air Force

30:13.236 --> 30:16.221
Base. And then we began to arrange for that trip. I 
was selected to, because of my infantry

30:24.961 --> 30:39.002
experience being in the 15th Field Artillery when 
I tried to get to West Point Prep Security to lead

30:24.961 --> 30:39.002
the motor convoy for the second bomb group. Well, 
actually the bomb group was going to be organized

30:39.022 --> 30:45.331
down at Tampa. So I led a group of vehicles about

30:55.505 --> 30:57.427
get to fly the airplane down there. And we actually 
went into a place called a groove field while

30:57.447 --> 31:03.115
MacDill was being completed. I'm sure you've 
heard of MacDill Air Force. I landed the first

31:04.997 --> 31:10.164
airplane on that runway at MacDill Air Force 
before it was completed. Sort of illegally, but I

31:10.904 --> 31:12.286
did it. And then of course we began to train there. 
How large was the groove? The aircraft, by the way,

31:21.425 --> 31:33.581
were split up, and we had three B-17s and about five 
or six B-18s, and an A-17, and then a trainer

31:21.425 --> 31:33.581
airplane, PT-13. Just the makings of it. Sure. 
Just woefully unequipped. Yeah. And how many men?

31:40.751 --> 31:41.251
How many what? How many men? Oh, gee, I don't 
remember how many men. I'd say we had about, in my

31:44.736 --> 31:48.681
squadron, we must have had...

31:51.665 --> 31:56.751
six or eight crews for bombing air, for a bomber. 
Strictly a cadre, you know, storming around. And

31:59.194 --> 32:03.440
we had to bring the new pilots in from a flying 
school and build it up. So you were building, yeah.

32:04.481 --> 32:05.723
Yeah, building. And lo and behold, right in the 
middle of that come,

32:05.743 --> 32:13.352
this is around of 1941

32:14.243 --> 32:24.955
we had to get aircraft to the British RAF, and the 
only way to do it was to have Americans ferry them. I

32:25.255 --> 32:37.830
was a two and four engine qualified pilot, so I was 
picked to be part of the hurry-up organized United

32:25.255 --> 32:37.830
States Army Air Corps ferrying command. I was sent 
out to Burbank, California. out in Lockheed

32:40.838 --> 32:57.793
Hudson Bomber building by Lockheed to supply 
those horrible things, clear up to Montreal where

32:40.838 --> 32:57.793
the RAF would pick them up and fly them over to 
England and that's the bombers they had for the

32:40.838 --> 32:57.793
early part of the war against Hitler. And what kind 
of bombers were we giving them? Lockheed Hudson

33:00.175 --> 33:01.876
Bombers. Those old Lockheed Hudson Bombers that 
couldn't carry more than two, three, five hundred

33:01.896 --> 33:05.339
pounds. And actually didn't even have a bombing 
system in them. But it was helped. at least we'd get

33:11.112 --> 33:14.236
an airplane with the idea of eventually getting 
equipment. Sure.

33:22.826 --> 33:28.673
Now, as far as the British were concerned, did you 
have an opportunity to meet any of the British

33:22.826 --> 33:28.673
representatives? At that time, no. As a matter of 
fact, we'd fly the airplane up to Montreal, get out

33:31.276 --> 33:38.385
of the airplane, take our parachute, commercial 
airliner and fly all the way back to Long Beach,

33:38.770 --> 33:45.641
California, then start the whole thing over 
again. Now when you flew, the bombers up there, how

33:45.661 --> 33:50.729
often did you have to stop? We'd fly from, I'd take 
off from Long Beach, my first stop would be Henson

33:51.150 --> 34:04.592
Air Force Base in Dallas, Texas, because that's 
where I lived, because I also lived with my current

33:51.150 --> 34:04.592
wife at that time, Daytoner. And they wouldn't 
mind if you went sort of an indirect route? Well,

34:07.785 --> 34:08.145
no, yeah. That was one of the direct routes. As a 
matter of fact, they picked it for us. It was the

34:10.888 --> 34:13.931
most direct route, you know, refueling and all. 
And also, weather dictated sometimes. We had two

34:16.533 --> 34:17.655
or three routes. And because of my bombing 
experience, when they formed these crews out

34:18.355 --> 34:24.441
there, I was one of the lead crews. And we were 
restricted to visual flights only. We couldn't

34:27.864 --> 34:30.367
fly on instruments. See, a lot of them were brand 
new pilots, comparatively speaking. Sure. So you

34:33.833 --> 34:36.296
were a veteran. At that time, there were about 
2,500 officers in the entire Army Air Corps. About

34:41.702 --> 34:43.504
2,500 officers. By that time, I was first 
lieutenant, by the way. So you were the pilot of the

34:48.831 --> 34:51.434
plane, and I was the co-pilot. Yeah, I was the 
pilot. Then we'd fly from there up to— From Texas up

34:53.897 --> 34:56.820
to— You'd fly first to Texas and then from Texas. 
Then to usually, for some reason or another, we'd

35:00.515 --> 35:03.919
always go to Fort Wayne, Indiana. And then from 
there, we'd go to Montreal. You had to make about

35:07.283 --> 35:15.352
two stops between Los Angeles and Montreal 
because of the range of the airplane. And we'd just

35:15.372 --> 35:18.296
go back and forth. And how long would it take you to 
fly between Montreal and California? Normally,

35:22.521 --> 35:24.343
I'd stay overnight at Dallas. And quite often we'd 
make the next flight in one day. I mean two days,

35:29.696 --> 35:31.519
make the whole flight in two days. Sometimes I'd 
have an engine problem or one of the guys, and we'd

35:32.160 --> 35:40.153
fly three or four airplanes together in sort of a 
loose formation. And maybe some problem would

35:40.173 --> 35:45.822
cause us to wait over, you know, or maybe weather or 
something. And I've had, well, sometimes it'd

35:45.842 --> 35:49.909
take maybe three or four days to make that trip. 
That started, I believe, that started around

35:51.813 --> 36:00.082
February or March, I believe. Or April, somewhere 
in there, spring. And then it was while I was a

36:03.285 --> 36:19.862
member of that, and doing that work, that one of my 
ex-buddies, my roommate at MacDill Air Force

36:03.285 --> 36:19.862
Base, Gibble Griller, called me on the telephone 
to tell me about Skip Adair recruiting guys for the

36:20.551 --> 36:22.353
American Volunteer Group in China. And then this 
opened up the story, of course, of the Flying

36:23.634 --> 36:29.940
Tigers. Now, why was I interested in this? That's 
the question. I still wanted to get in fighters.

36:38.668 --> 36:47.496
And here I was ferrying American aircraft, doing 
my part to get them to England, who was fighting in

36:38.668 --> 36:47.496
the war. I knew we were going to get in war. I was 
convinced. And third, I wanted a regular

36:52.381 --> 36:55.105
commission. I was a career officer by then. I'd 
been a reserve officer all along. I had never had

36:59.891 --> 37:01.914
college at all. I wanted to be a regular officer. I 
was committed. I didn't want to be an aeronautical

37:05.559 --> 37:08.023
engineer. I wanted to be a pilot in the United 
States Army. I wanted to be a pilot in the Air Force.

37:13.170 --> 37:16.836
And you could get a regular commission by 
volunteering for the Flying Tigers? Well, I

37:16.996 --> 37:19.920
figured that we were going to get in the war. There 
was only about 2,500, incidentally, go back a

37:20.727 --> 37:24.471
minute. I did take an examination one time at 
Langley Field between when I first reported there

37:24.851 --> 37:39.986
in February of 39 up until early part of 41 when we 
went down to Tampa. I took an examination of, it was

37:40.346 --> 37:50.616
by some senator's name, Morrison Rowdy, or I can't 
remember the name, but it's, You could take

37:51.119 --> 37:56.545
examinations and get a regular commission that 
way. They'd select very few. A Brownell Act, I

37:57.767 --> 38:02.252
think they called it, B-R-O-W-N-E-L, I think 
that's the way it's called. But I didn't have

38:02.272 --> 38:04.254
college. Sure. And they were held against me. So I 
knew I had to have college some way, but this comes

38:07.097 --> 38:10.821
up later on. I knew if we got in war, and I knew that if 
I had combat experience, I knew in China, I knew

38:19.655 --> 38:21.517
we'd be clashing with the Japanese. The Japanese 
were already fighting the Chinese. And I knew, as a

38:23.659 --> 38:28.424
matter of fact, we were in on all practical 
purposes going to be the Chinese airport. So I knew

38:29.044 --> 38:30.606
I'd have combat experience. And I'd signed a 
one-year contract of Flying Tigers, AVG. Then I'd

38:35.230 --> 38:43.959
come back home, and here we are getting ready, 
well, tracking in the war by then, and expanding,

38:35.230 --> 38:43.959
obviously. Then certainly they'd give me a 
regular commission. I just knew it. I hadn't made

38:47.762 --> 38:48.463
it. So that was one of the reasons that you wanted to 
get an applying doctor. There were three reasons.

38:53.772 --> 38:54.693
Three reasons. I wanted to get fighters. I wanted 
to get a regular commission. And I wanted to make

39:00.098 --> 39:09.247
some money to put my mother and father in a home that 
was paid

39:00.098 --> 39:09.247
for. And tell me about the money. How'd they pay 
you? I'd get $500 for every aircraft I shot down.

39:16.237 --> 39:19.122
And that was the main thing that attracted me. I 
figured I'd get in combat, and I'd shoot Japanese

39:19.142 --> 39:22.307
down. Plus, in fact, I got $600 a month as a wingman, 
and all my expenses paid, and so forth and so on. And

39:33.265 --> 39:34.607
who paid for your expenses? Who gave you the money? 
This came out of Lend-Lease money, really. The

39:38.593 --> 39:42.820
Chinese government paid, but it was originally 
given by Americans. It was Americans. But when you

39:43.658 --> 39:47.643
got a check, did it say the Republic of China on it? 
When you got a check, it was, the check was made out,

39:47.703 --> 39:55.131
how was it? What was that corporation?

39:58.835 --> 39:59.436
Air America? CAMCO. CAMCO. Central Aircraft 
Manufacturing Company. CIA, if you will. Or,

40:06.304 --> 40:09.007
we'll forget that remark. But Lend-Lease. Oh, we 
all know that. Well, sure. Lend-Lease, OK.

40:11.790 --> 40:13.632
Lend-Lease, really. At least money. But see, here 
I'm getting into dickerings between foreign

40:15.780 --> 40:21.848
countries again. China didn't have an air force. 
Chennault was over there. He'd been away since

40:25.353 --> 40:27.156
about 1937. And this is a story you should hear. How 
did the Flying Tigers ever get started, ABG?

40:38.071 --> 40:42.657
I'm sure you've heard of Sun, S-W-N-G, a very 
influential Chinese man. and needing help with

40:43.008 --> 40:46.291
fighting the Japanese. Through his State 
Department offices,

40:47.312 --> 41:01.106
he gave an interview to the JISMO with Chenault. 
Chenault was over there with the Generalissimo.

41:03.468 --> 41:12.357
They'd been trying to set up a train to train a 
polyglot bunch of, even some Russians. And it was

41:12.455 --> 41:23.190
some sort of an air force for the Chinese, and no 
more than three or four months it tracked up all the

41:12.455 --> 41:23.190
aircraft, and it was just no good. And Chenault got 
the idea of recruiting some top-notch American

41:23.931 --> 41:37.911
pilots and aircrew, and sold Soong on it. Soong got 
the ear of President Roosevelt. And in a 30-minute

41:41.699 --> 41:57.380
dissertation to the President of the United 
States, Soong, just a second, honey, and you can't

41:41.699 --> 41:57.380
find this in writing anyplace, Chenault talked 
President Roosevelt into letting him Soong or

41:41.699 --> 41:57.380
Chenault? No. Soong and Chenault. Oh, they were 
both in Washington, D.C. Oh, yes. And a madam. And a

42:02.888 --> 42:03.548
madam. Yeah. Generalist of Moshe and Kashek's 
wife. Yeah. The biggest beggar in the world. Yeah.

42:08.916 --> 42:09.917
But very influential. Those three, in 1937. Is 
there a 37 or 38? No, wait a minute. This

42:20.808 --> 42:27.418
could have been around 1940, that late. Maybe 
early 1941. I have a document someplace. At any

42:33.527 --> 42:39.516
rate, in 30 minutes, the President told Chenault, 
yes, I'll give authorized to own channels and then

42:41.251 --> 42:45.558
you can start tomorrow. But you will be permitted 
to recruit any pilot and any air maintenance man

42:45.759 --> 43:01.685
that you want to recruit from the United States 
Army Air Corps or the United States Navy or the

42:45.759 --> 43:01.685
United States Marine Corps that will volunteer to 
go with you. You've got an open ticket to go. And he

43:05.171 --> 43:06.493
began to recruit. How about private? Oh yeah, if he 
wanted to. But he wanted military training. Sure

43:13.978 --> 43:15.560
he did. To my knowledge, there was not one single 
civilian commercial type pilot in our group.

43:24.655 --> 43:32.487
It was 48, I'd say 47% Air Force, maybe 2% Marine, 
and 51% Navy. There were a hundred pilots. He was

43:35.306 --> 43:46.881
going to recruit a hundred pilots and he was going 
to get a hundred P-40s that were sitting in crates

43:35.306 --> 43:46.881
in Buffalo at the Curtis Wright outfit that were 
turned down by the British for the North African

43:35.306 --> 43:46.881
campaign. Why were they turned down? Already 
obsolete. They never coped with the Major Schmidt

43:51.768 --> 43:56.013
and Falkirk aircraft. This was like a Hurricane 
Hunter type aircraft. And at that time, see, we

44:01.441 --> 44:03.664
didn't know much about Negro. Right.

44:07.109 --> 44:12.697
OK, let's go.

44:12.717 --> 44:19.567
OK, we want to find out about how you left the 
service, got in the flying tires, and how that

44:12.717 --> 44:19.567
worked. I mean, legally, how did that work?

44:25.436 --> 44:29.862
Well, see, we had a land lease arrangement that was 
set up. I guess originally for the European area,

44:30.533 --> 44:37.341
but extended it worldwide. This is when the 
Chinese jumped aboard, and then it was

44:39.243 --> 44:46.611
coincidental that they had Chennault over there 
trying to develop them an air force to fight Japan.

44:47.352 --> 44:49.515
They'd been fighting Japan for several years. 
Yeah, since 37. Sure. And

44:51.196 --> 45:00.507
Chennault had just practically given up with any 
of the efforts.

45:01.128 --> 45:03.190
the ways that the Chinese were trying to do it. So 
then they got this idea with the backing and . And

45:11.399 --> 45:20.369
soon, and of course Roosevelt, and then we were 
practically in war anyhow. And whether it was

45:21.110 --> 45:26.116
legal or not, that's the reason I say I have never 
seen anything in writing on this. And I'm told,

45:26.396 --> 45:31.101
much personally, that there's nothing written 
any place. Just when all gave, I mean, the

45:31.739 --> 45:35.244
president of Roanoke gave instructions over the 
telephone. And next thing I know, I got this call

45:36.225 --> 45:53.728
one night out at Long Beach from Gibbo Grover, one 
of my roommates that I lived with and flew together

45:36.225 --> 45:53.728
at the 43rd bomb group there in McDale. And he said, 
you always want to get in fighters. You've got a

45:57.773 --> 45:59.215
chance. you ever hear of General Chennault? And I 
said, well, yeah, I've heard of him. Make a long

46:04.205 --> 46:13.154
story short, well, Gip Adair had been this guy that 
was going, he was an ex-retired Air Force guy, and

46:04.205 --> 46:13.154
he happened to be a friend of Gibbo Broder's. When 
he told Gibbo that at McDill, he was authorized to

46:14.135 --> 46:21.663
go on the base and recruit pilots. So Gibbo comes, I 
know a man that'd be dying to get in your outfit, so

46:21.683 --> 46:25.927
who is it? Charlie Bond, well. Kibo called me and 
gave me the phone number, and I called Kip Adair,

46:27.443 --> 46:32.689
and he explained generally what he was on to. 
One-year contract paid by the Chinese, which was

46:32.809 --> 46:39.437
out of Lend-Lease money. And that's the way the 
whole thing was financed.

46:46.084 --> 46:57.197
And when we get in combat, if you get in combat with 
Japanese, you get $500 in cash for every airplane

46:46.084 --> 46:57.197
you shoot down, deposited to a bank of your choice 
in the United States. All your transportation

46:57.700 --> 47:00.697
expenses will be paid. Your living expenses in 
China will be paid.
