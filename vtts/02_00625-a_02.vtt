WEBVTT

00:15.708 --> 00:19.854
that they were of any real interest to the Japanese 
nation or the Japanese people. But they have tried

00:20.775 --> 00:35.515
to join these investigations, and I think at the 
present time now in CSK, which is Cooperative

00:20.775 --> 00:35.515
Studies of the Kurashio, was an example whereby 
they would like to focus their efforts in the area

00:20.775 --> 00:35.515
of Japan. But in terms of the INPFC,

00:36.776 --> 00:44.567
the Japanese, of course, work was done by the 
Japanese Fishery Agency. And they had access to

00:48.210 --> 00:51.074
Japanese oceanographic groups. And actually, 
the fishery agency vessels did some studies. But

00:57.843 --> 01:14.925
as this work progressed, and as we were searching 
for common terminology of fronts and features and

00:57.843 --> 01:14.925
current

00:57.843 --> 01:14.925
nomenclature currents,

00:57.843 --> 01:14.925
we received a great deal of cooperation from the 
Japanese. And in the late 1950s, we would actually

01:15.277 --> 01:24.156
meet in ADAC, which is in the middle of the Aleutian 
Islands, and exchange data. At that time, we had a

01:25.058 --> 01:29.447
computer aboard our ship, and we were able to give 
them computer printouts. And they, of course, are

01:29.528 --> 01:32.053
very adept at these pen and ink forms that they can 
fill out. And some strategies for fishing and for

01:34.859 --> 01:45.912
investigating environmental features in the 
Aleutian area came about at these meetings in

01:34.859 --> 01:45.912
mid-salmon season at ADAC. And we have published 
two joint reports, Bulletin 13 and Bulletin 33,

01:46.973 --> 02:02.952
which summarizes just only the top of, well, it's a 
severe synthesis of 20 years' work, really, is

01:46.973 --> 02:02.952
what it is. So we've enjoyed working with them very 
much in the Aleutian area. And the Oak Bay

02:09.273 --> 02:21.186
Laboratory has had excellent cooperation with 
them in the eastern Bering Sea to the point where

02:09.273 --> 02:21.186
the Japanese would provide the Oshiro Maru, which 
is their big research vessel. This is the vessel at

02:21.807 --> 02:24.570
the Kaido University. It's the College of 
Fisheries where they would, we would send people

02:25.832 --> 02:32.719
on board their ship and conduct joint studies 
together. So I would say that it took a while to get

02:33.458 --> 02:37.544
started, the early 50s. But by the end of the late 
50s, and particularly the early 60s, it was just

02:37.664 --> 02:48.960
absolutely a joy to work with these groups. And 
part of the rationale for continuing on the salmon

02:49.441 --> 02:58.774
studies was the fact that it was just a tremendous 
international exchange of information. from an

02:59.058 --> 03:01.961
environmental standpoint and a fishery 
standpoint. So even though they couldn't decide

03:01.981 --> 03:11.409
on the protocol to the treaty, which was an 
equitable division of salmon, they felt that this

03:01.981 --> 03:11.409
should go on. And it's only been the last few years 
that the field programs have died down. The next

03:17.815 --> 03:22.219
series of questions, I pretty well answered the 
questions I had about your work that I had jotted

03:17.815 --> 03:22.219
down. The next series of questions concern really 
government service, for lack of a better word.

03:28.859 --> 03:38.993
There is a move now to centralize all funding 
agencies of oceanography under one central

03:28.859 --> 03:38.993
agency, probably the Commerce Department, 
probably NOAA. What are your feelings on that?

03:43.840 --> 03:50.991
Well, I don't think bigger is better, and that's 
what would happen if you do this. But I really feel

03:51.011 --> 03:57.600
that a lot more progress could be made a lot sooner 
if we had sort of a

03:57.867 --> 04:03.213
division by area. Say, for example, the Arctic 
studies, which say the Arctic and the Antarctic,

04:04.255 --> 04:16.069
the Pacific studies, the Atlantic studies, and 
kind of leave the Indian Ocean to fend for itself at

04:04.255 --> 04:16.069
this time because we've spent a lot of money there. 
And then there are other people now that are

04:16.169 --> 04:18.952
capable of studying it. I really would like to see a 
center that is responsive to the Pacific Ocean as

04:19.873 --> 04:26.541
an entity.

04:28.192 --> 04:32.000
I don't think that this one group would satisfy 
that. I would rather see it broken down into four or

04:32.060 --> 04:40.536
five groups by area rather than one single 
discipline center. In some respects, I think that

04:42.881 --> 04:48.512
the National Oceanographic Data Center is an 
example of The concept of having data available

04:49.268 --> 05:00.891
and the concept of insisting that people that are 
spending government money acquiring data turn it

04:49.268 --> 05:00.891
in in a certain established format to a central 
repository is fine. But it just becomes

05:01.833 --> 05:07.765
monolithic to handle this. And I think it could be 
better done on this. One suggestion I would have

05:12.151 --> 05:19.618
instead of a National Oceanographic Data Center, 
they had one on the east coast for the Atlantic and

05:12.151 --> 05:19.618
one on the west coast for the Pacific. And I think it 
would accelerate the studies. It would avoid a lot

05:23.202 --> 05:29.408
of duplication and provide a focus for what should 
be done in these areas. Nature of grant giving. At

05:34.613 --> 05:41.179
one time, certainly very early in your career, 
most grant giving was sort of done by ONR and

05:41.851 --> 05:54.951
intended to be sort of divided between research of 
R&D based upon peer research and mission oriented

05:41.851 --> 05:54.951
research. Since then, there was a lot of criticism 
of that for various reasons. And since then too

06:01.041 --> 06:08.753
now, the grant giving having gone out of NSF and 
what have you, various government contracts

06:01.041 --> 06:08.753
types.

06:11.365 --> 06:13.108
The arguments go two ways. One, that in ONR there 
was too much in-house review. That is, the

06:16.653 --> 06:18.615
government was guilty of that. And secondly, that 
now that they're afraid the same thing is

06:19.116 --> 06:30.393
happening in government contracts, and that the 
NSF way of reviewing each grant separately and so

06:19.116 --> 06:30.393
forth is better. Now, that sort of jumbled 
sentence, if you can make any sense out of it, I'd

06:30.413 --> 06:35.820
like some comments on that. What do you think about 
in-house reviews? How do you see your role as a

06:37.994 --> 06:44.863
reviewer out of house since you make comments on 
NSF grants? What do you think about the present

06:44.883 --> 06:48.067
funding structure, and how would you change it?

06:52.593 --> 07:03.867
Well, I'm really not sure what you're driving at, 
but I know sort of peripherally this business of

06:52.593 --> 07:03.867
peer review versus in-house and out-house 
reviews.

07:06.057 --> 07:12.463
My own feeling is, and I think that's of a lot of 
people, that this becomes kind of clannish or kind

07:06.057 --> 07:12.463
of cliquish. And there are many indications of 
this. I think there are still strong feelings in

07:18.109 --> 07:34.866
the community that probably people aren't going 
to voice that, say, Woods Hole and Scripps have too

07:18.109 --> 07:34.866
much of a say in what is done in terms of academic 
funding. It's kind of hard to break into this. They

07:37.036 --> 07:38.658
can become quite hostile. And I don't know whether 
this is subjective or not, in the sense that

07:39.860 --> 07:55.865
because the ocean is so large and because it is so 
complex, it's almost easy to be negative on any

07:39.860 --> 07:55.865
proposal.

07:58.990 --> 08:02.575
You know that this person, even if he has some 
experience is probably not going to be able to

08:03.162 --> 08:08.689
answer his question satisfactorily because of 
this thing. The whole ocean is a turbulent regime,

08:08.709 --> 08:15.758
and it just requires tremendous resources to 
study it and to monitor it. And I think that any

08:16.960 --> 08:27.613
reviewer can, you know, on any given day say yes to 
something he said no to the other day. So this

08:27.673 --> 08:33.000
becomes sort of a clannish group that your 
friend's projects are approved. And I don't think

08:34.229 --> 08:39.037
you asked that specifically, but I think that's 
the heart of it. And although NSF tries to change

08:40.119 --> 08:51.700
their desks quite frequently, really they're 
still bringing in people from the same places to

08:40.119 --> 08:51.700
sit at the desks. And all I can say is, on the whole, I 
think the money is distributed fairly well. But I

08:59.693 --> 09:05.721
think there are a few people that have too much of 
the lion's share of it. Well, that's not exactly

09:07.142 --> 09:10.346
what I was answering, but that's a good enough 
answer. That certainly explains what I think we

09:10.406 --> 09:13.951
need to know about it. Also now, a controversy is 
raging, beginning with the idea of the 200-mile

09:13.971 --> 09:21.861
limit, on where should oceanography work. Should 
it move back towards the continental shelves,

09:21.881 --> 09:26.747
where most of the species exist? and how the 
200-mile limits will affect both fishing and

09:27.318 --> 09:34.028
oceanographic research. So how about some 
comments on that?

09:40.558 --> 09:53.578
I don't think that oceanography should retreat to 
200 miles because if there's anything that we

09:40.558 --> 09:53.578
learned, it's that there is continuity 
throughout the whole world oceans. And if you

09:54.368 --> 10:00.256
limit yourself to just sort of a coastal study, 
your time frame is so short. You're able to measure

10:00.276 --> 10:09.689
and observe what's there, but you have no way of 
ascertaining how it's going to change in the next

10:00.276 --> 10:09.689
week or even the next month until you know 
something upstream and we know. Of course, on this

10:10.009 --> 10:13.194
coast, everything out is. We have a unique onshore 
flow here. So I think that's one of the fallacies of

10:15.617 --> 10:19.903
saying, well, convenient to work on the coast, we 
have good visibility. If we put our ships on the

10:23.173 --> 10:30.502
coast and the ground fisheries are concentrated 
on the coast, let's study it. I can't subscribe to

10:31.283 --> 10:38.773
the fact that we just give up the open ocean studies 
and come into the coast. I think we should have a

10:38.833 --> 10:41.016
total ocean study. And given a total ocean study, 
at that point, we can concentrate within the 200

10:42.338 --> 10:49.587
miles. Now, I think what will happen is that we're 
going to find

10:50.292 --> 11:07.550
just I think even oceanographers are going to be 
surprised at the complexity of flow within the

10:50.292 --> 11:07.550
200-mile regime. We all have a tendency to 
simplify, and sometimes the data only permits you

11:07.690 --> 11:13.916
a simple picture of what's going on. And I envision 
once the 200-mile limit is that these fisheries

11:20.617 --> 11:23.920
councils are devoting their efforts to. Once the 
200-mile

11:23.980 --> 11:49.864
regime is clarified as to the kinds and numbers of 
fish that are there that are going to be

11:23.980 --> 11:49.864
commercial fish that are going to be caught either 
by foreign nations or our nations, that there will

11:23.980 --> 11:49.864
be another U.N. cry such as the one in the 50s to do 
the environmental measurements that will

11:50.080 --> 12:02.234
provide insight into why they are moving as they do 
and into a predictive regime. And so I guess that's

12:03.776 --> 12:16.510
my best answer, that I think we still have to deal 
with the oceans as a total concept and that we

12:03.776 --> 12:16.510
should concentrate. but not to the exclusion of 
offshore, and when we do, we'll find the time and

12:16.793 --> 12:30.530
space scales that are necessary to really pin down 
what's going on in the coastal areas, surprising

12:16.793 --> 12:30.530
to everyone. Do you think the 200-mile limit will 
hurt American fishermen? Well, of course, that's

12:34.695 --> 12:44.927
a loaded question in a fishery center because it 
does hurt some and not hurt others, but I, as an

12:34.695 --> 12:44.927
individual, am very... I'm very pleased that we 
have established this notion of the

12:46.409 --> 12:53.539
responsibility and the protection of this. It's a 
little grander than the scheme I proposed 10 years

12:54.701 --> 12:58.467
ago. I proposed to Dr. McHugh, who is now at 
Sunnybrook, and he was director of research, that

12:59.168 --> 13:10.965
the fishery should be responsible for the 
continental shelf and what happens to it, in other

13:11.401 --> 13:13.684
words, out to the shelf. At this time, you know, we 
had three miles that was not necessarily ascribed

13:13.724 --> 13:18.351
to fisheries. My concept was that the National 
Fisheries Service should be responsible for the

13:19.452 --> 13:32.791
environment, for the protection of it, and to 
obtain information on it. And actually, at the

13:32.811 --> 13:37.698
time, he felt this was a good idea, but it was 
something that passed in the night. And so now we

13:37.838 --> 13:41.323
have 200 miles.

13:42.518 --> 13:56.381
I think we have a very interesting, perhaps 10 or 20 
years ahead, to pin down these swirls and eddies

13:42.518 --> 13:56.381
that pass through this 200-mile zone that are 
going to affect the fisheries. As you look at a

13:56.401 --> 14:05.857
coastal fishery, most of these are ground 
fisheries, and their guideposts, their pathways

13:56.401 --> 14:05.857
are oriented to the bottom. But I still think 
that... These pulses that come from the ocean

14:08.236 --> 14:14.726
regimes have a great deal to do as to how they move on 
the bottom. And we'll find that out in the future.

14:21.637 --> 14:30.490
In terms of technology, what sorts of things do you 
think that oceanography most needs to advance the

14:21.637 --> 14:30.490
discipline? What sort of inventions would you 
like to have most?

14:38.459 --> 14:49.394
Well, I really haven't given any specific thought 
to that because I don't think we've exploited the

14:38.459 --> 14:49.394
equipment that we have. What we need is precise 
measurement of a large area of the ocean surface. I

14:59.387 --> 15:02.712
should have said area, but of course it's 
three-dimensional. We need to know the

15:02.772 --> 15:06.677
conditions from the surface to bottom and how they 
change. And we have the equipment for that, with

15:07.687 --> 15:16.640
moored buoys, with buoys with releases, with 
buoys that can be tracked by satellite. Really,

15:18.682 --> 15:23.990
the question is, do we want to spend the money for 
it? And if you remember these buoy plans that came

15:24.370 --> 15:36.968
up, I think they were 500 or 1,000 buoys off our 
coast, and people felt they would be hazards to

15:24.370 --> 15:36.968
navigation and what have you. I was for that. I 
think that's

15:39.549 --> 15:44.137
where we have to go. I don't know of any other 
instrument you could ask for, including

15:44.157 --> 15:52.192
satellites, that would give you the information 
that would come from these buoys of rays. I think

15:54.395 --> 16:00.306
they'll come eventually, but what form they'll 
take, I haven't given any other thought to.

16:01.872 --> 16:07.184
in terms of advice to young oceanographers, may we 
say. What sort of advice would you give one? What

16:08.667 --> 16:09.930
discipline should he enter? Like, for example, 
nuclear engineering was probably the hot, I

16:09.950 --> 16:18.529
suppose, oceanographic device in the 1960s. 
What's going to be at the 1970s?

16:26.054 --> 16:36.207
Well, if you're looking for a key word, I think 
obviously the key word, and these key words come

16:26.054 --> 16:36.207
every three to five years, I think the present key 
word is climate. And I don't think there is another

16:36.267 --> 16:40.332
one beyond climate. And as you think of climate, 
the ocean is inextricably linked with climate.

16:45.298 --> 16:48.923
And we haven't even begun to study this aspect. 
There are several programs. But air-sea

16:51.502 --> 17:00.977
interaction is a word that people have kicked 
around for 20 or 30 years, and yet we still don't

16:51.502 --> 17:00.977
have a good handle on this. And so I would say that 
ocean studies will continue under the guise of

17:02.319 --> 17:12.615
climate, which has an effect on agriculture. It 
has built into it an association with meteorology

17:13.456 --> 17:18.744
and what have you. And I think it's sort of a good 
umbrella to deal with and an important area

17:18.824 --> 17:29.340
of study.

17:32.685 --> 17:41.438
As far as what information would you give to 
somebody studying oceanography,

17:32.685 --> 17:41.438
it's really

17:45.299 --> 17:47.141
It's up to the individual, I think. I don't think 
you can give anybody any real instruction. You

17:50.845 --> 17:56.692
have really

17:50.845 --> 17:56.692
an interest in something or you don't. And if you 
have the interest in it, you associate it with it as

17:56.712 --> 18:04.320
sort of an all-consuming drive to study it and work 
with it. And I think if you have it, then

18:05.321 --> 18:10.547
intuitively you will find the area of the ocean. 
And certainly there are many facets to it where you

18:13.919 --> 18:16.462
can devote this energy to it. I'm a little 
concerned about people that recruit people to

18:18.343 --> 18:22.207
study the ocean. I don't think that that's 
necessary.

18:28.294 --> 18:41.547
The thing that I would tell someone that wanted to 
get into it is that it is perhaps sort of trite in the

18:28.294 --> 18:41.547
sense that it's a new frontier. And it's not really 
a new frontier. The oceans have been around a long

18:44.446 --> 18:46.530
time. But we know so little about them that any 
contribution is going to be recorded and people

18:47.231 --> 18:56.447
will lean on and build on. And I don't think we're 
going to understand the oceans to the degree that

19:02.958 --> 19:07.986
we want to, much less the degree we need to for many, 
many decades. And so it's an exciting period for

19:08.467 --> 19:14.276
someone who wants to devote their life to a study. 
It isn't something that's going to dry up and be old

19:14.296 --> 19:19.825
hat in 10 or 20 years. The necessity of integrating 
this, the necessity of understanding all the

19:20.647 --> 19:27.598
forces,

19:29.519 --> 19:30.941
We're really pioneers. I really think if someone 
could look ahead 100 years from now, that even the

19:31.061 --> 19:46.560
people that are coming into the field now will 
really still be considered pioneers, and that

19:31.061 --> 19:46.560
they will still be studying the oceans for a long 
time to come. And that should be, if someone really

19:47.160 --> 19:55.290
is interested in it, that should be enough 
incentive to really let them build a career on it.

19:56.232 --> 20:02.604
Have you ever had any regrets about choosing 
government service rather than the academic

19:56.232 --> 20:02.604
world? Not a bit. Not really. They both have their 
drawbacks, and it's kind of hard to put me on the

20:05.248 --> 20:11.019
spot where so many people are going to read this. 
But

20:11.259 --> 20:17.110
I think that... Government can become very 
restrictive. I think that I've been fortunate to

20:19.730 --> 20:24.897
live in a period where we've sort of been 
developing our own guidelines. In other words,

20:24.957 --> 20:36.815
the fishery is so vague, the ocean is so vague, that 
we've had a great deal of latitude within budget

20:24.957 --> 20:36.815
limitations to study just this myriad of 
questions that we have. I really can't say whether

20:37.576 --> 20:42.945
the next 10 or 20 years that this freedom will still 
exist. In fact, I'm asking for some reduction in it

20:43.005 --> 20:46.590
when I ask for it. integrated studies, or at least 
people working together. You lose freedom when

20:50.450 --> 20:52.514
you do that. But no, I've seriously considered 
teaching. In fact, Dr. Fleming felt I would be very

20:58.545 --> 21:02.211
good at it, and I did too. But

21:02.432 --> 21:09.304
I've been very, very pleased with my choice.

21:12.052 --> 21:25.126
Now,

21:12.052 --> 21:25.126
the next series of questions, if you should like, 
are what we call predictive questions, which

21:12.052 --> 21:25.126
always puts a scientist and a historian on the 
spot, since neither of us ever like to do that.

21:29.070 --> 21:30.592
Miraculture and aquaculture. Will it be 
successful? Will it not be successful? Are you

21:33.595 --> 21:34.616
optimistic? Are you not optimistic? In what 
direction will it go in?

21:40.418 --> 21:51.175
Well, it doesn't really behoove me to answer that 
because this is

21:40.418 --> 21:51.175
kind of a troubled area in the National Marine 
Fisheries Service now. I think that all I can say

21:51.455 --> 21:56.523
about it is that it is a high-risk venture and 
always will be. I think there are opportunities

21:56.723 --> 22:00.970
for considerable profit. In a high-risk 
industry, there are opportunities for somebody

22:00.990 --> 22:08.822
really to lose money. I personally love

22:10.405 --> 22:23.299
shellfish because of the diet of fish in World War 
II that was subjected to or given to midshipmen. I

22:23.379 --> 22:32.489
really find that my fish diet is limited, but my 
shellfish one is a preferable diet for me. In fact,

22:32.569 --> 22:35.652
lobster to me is ambrosia. There's nothing more. 
The biggest steak in the world. I could pass up very

22:39.616 --> 22:43.601
easily the most tasty one for a lobster. That's 
what I consider really elegant. And yet I must

22:48.968 --> 23:06.771
admit that aquaculture using purified or 
sewerage or perhaps heated waters from a

22:48.968 --> 23:06.771
radioactive effluent or something I'm not so sure 
my palate would respond the same to that, an

23:07.072 --> 23:16.266
organism raised in captivity versus the one that 
I'm used to. And I think it's subjective, but it

23:16.867 --> 23:21.574
still would pose a problem for me. Well, you 
actually hinted at it. What about pollution in the

23:27.023 --> 23:29.046
oceans? What do you feel like is the major danger? 
How great is the danger in terms of pollution?

23:35.345 --> 23:39.450
Clearly, the sea is not dying, despite what 
Jacques Cousteau says. And what kind of control

23:39.470 --> 23:43.414
should there be? I would answer it. I'm pretty much 
joined with your initial sentiments that I think

23:46.358 --> 23:53.887
that Cousteau is an alarmist. But I think there's a 
role for someone that wants to do that today.

24:00.278 --> 24:06.885
because of these alarms that this word is getting 
to people who really have never considered the

24:00.278 --> 24:06.885
ocean before. They live inland. They don't see it. 
They don't travel on it. To them, it's something

24:10.068 --> 24:13.692
that is just there in geography. And so he's 
getting a lot of support, and I applaud him for it.

24:22.361 --> 24:27.106
And I see a long-term difficulty without some 
restraints. But I really feel that man... will

24:30.856 --> 24:34.661
impose restraints where and when they are needed. 
And I have no fear, as you say, of a polluted ocean.

24:41.951 --> 24:44.214
Tankers are a short-term phenomenon. Who knows? 
Most of the oil reserves we have are 20 or 30 years.

24:48.580 --> 24:55.229
And this is just a passing phase in terms of oceans. 
I am concerned about the long term. the sinking of

24:58.835 --> 25:01.538
radioactive waste. I think that's a terrible 
mistake. But I don't know. I have to put it in the

25:05.502 --> 25:07.524
proper focus. And everybody says the oil is 
polluted. If you get in a raft and you find garbage

25:10.066 --> 25:28.285
in the ocean, well, you have to consider in World 
War II, with the limited shipping we had, there was

25:10.066 --> 25:28.285
great restraint on dumping garbage over the sides 
so that the U-boat might find the convoy had been

25:10.066 --> 25:28.285
through. If we really went to that extreme in those 
days, there must have been garbage in the ocean

25:28.619 --> 25:34.649
too. It's kind of inconceivable that we went to 
such great efforts not to dump anything of

25:35.510 --> 25:52.078
anything over the side in the middle of a huge ocean 
thousands of miles across that a U-boat would find

25:35.510 --> 25:52.078
it or would track trails. So I think, with the 
cautions and the restraints that have been put on

25:53.611 --> 26:13.030
the tankers, that perhaps we are not polluting the 
oceans any more than was done by the large shipping

25:53.611 --> 26:13.030
with utter abandon, say, in the 30s and 40s, when 
literally they cleaned ship outside the harbor.

26:14.011 --> 26:16.774
They literally piled stuff up on decks. The minute 
they could drop the pilot, they would dump it.

26:22.467 --> 26:32.964
So as an oceanographer, I'm concerned as to what 
could happen, but I'm not on the alarmist team at

26:22.467 --> 26:32.964
this point. Are there any, well, beside 
radioactive waste, are there any particular

26:32.984 --> 26:48.508
types of things that you're worried about, 
particularly in terms of the relationship to

26:32.984 --> 26:48.508
salmon, which you know a great deal about, any type 
of pollutants which affect animal life in the

26:32.984 --> 26:48.508
city?

26:54.783 --> 26:59.129
Well, all I can say is, of course, man has the 
potential to spoil the ocean. But I

27:00.271 --> 27:11.886
just think that regulations will come along by 
people that are aware of the contamination that

27:00.271 --> 27:11.886
comes along. By that, I'm saying we don't need a 
multimillion or billion dollar

27:22.660 --> 27:25.983
monitoring program to guard against ocean 
pollution. If we're going to pollute it, we know

27:26.084 --> 27:31.850
the people are either carrying it to sea or they're 
dumping it in the rivers. And I think that the

27:31.970 --> 27:37.135
cleanup that has been started will suffice. I hope 
I'm not proven wrong. But that would be my feel.

27:44.923 --> 27:47.206
Good enough. Now, these next series of questions 
are sort of historic interest questions. What

27:53.170 --> 27:58.656
probably single discovery in oceanography, 
let's say in the last 20 years, surprised you the

27:53.170 --> 27:58.656
most? What do you think was the most important

27:58.676 --> 28:09.849
discovery as far as oceanographers were 
concerned?

28:09.869 --> 28:14.635
Well, in terms of there are various phases. I think 
the plate theories are some of the more

28:14.755 --> 28:20.241
interesting ones that have come along. This 
finding of heated thermal plumes at death of the

28:20.828 --> 28:36.055
Galapagos Islands and in the Red Sea, we've always 
considered that these could exist. I think these

28:36.776 --> 28:44.490
are interesting, but I don't think that these are 
purely observational things.

28:46.023 --> 29:00.977
I find that the most exciting thing that's 
happened in the last 20 years is really the ability

28:46.023 --> 29:00.977
to simulate some of the complex phenomena in the 
huge computer. But although I am interested and

29:01.936 --> 29:17.759
intrigued by this, I'm also somewhat 
disappointed in the sense that it looks like

29:01.936 --> 29:17.759
something that people are going to play with for 
another 20 years. My feeling is that

29:18.480 --> 29:27.032
here again, coordination is greatly needed. I 
think everybody at a university today is

29:27.603 --> 29:38.037
compelled to deal with a computer problem, to deal 
with some kind of a model. And it's inconceivable

29:39.018 --> 29:45.767
that we need all of these people building all of 
these little finite models. And I think there's a

29:46.048 --> 29:50.574
tremendous waste of effort and time in that. And I 
would like to see...

29:55.514 --> 29:57.696
some real coordination here again.

30:01.940 --> 30:10.587
So, you know, excuse the interruption, but I think 
that has been the most interesting, but I think

30:01.940 --> 30:10.587
they have such a long way to go. Because we know the 
meteorologists have tried this for years, and

30:12.989 --> 30:20.996
they still can't forecast more than a few days. And 
although the ocean is more sluggish and people

30:26.142 --> 30:32.911
hope for more accurate results from the same types 
of models. I still think the complexity in the

30:33.071 --> 30:47.049
ocean is a long way away, even with the present 
models that we, you know, defining the complexity

30:33.071 --> 30:47.049
that we need in terms of fishery, specifically, is 
a long way away. So that would be my comment.
