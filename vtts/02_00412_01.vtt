00:01.904 --> 00:03.967
Your name is? Please tell me your name. My name? 
Romulo, Romulo Munguia Torres. And where were you

00:15.723 --> 00:17.546
born? In Guadalajara.

00:22.012 --> 00:23.594
In Guadalajara? In what year? In 1885. Well,

00:28.077 --> 00:55.384
during

00:28.077 --> 00:55.384
these days in the past,

00:28.077 --> 00:55.384
tell me about your life when you were young in 
Guadalajara. It took me about ten years.

01:03.502 --> 01:10.555
My mother had nine children.

01:10.935 --> 01:19.330
I was the second of the men, but I was the fifth in the 
family. Los anteriores murieron y fueron dos, y

01:19.529 --> 01:29.038
hubo dos mujeres. De manera que yo fui el quinto de 
la familia.

01:34.804 --> 01:47.697
Entonces, empezamos a luchar de una manera muy 
violenta, dado que mi padre, He was persecuted by

01:48.132 --> 01:52.798
the government of General Díaz. He died because of 
the persecution of General Díaz. My father was a

02:00.227 --> 02:05.214
supporter of General Ramón Corona. He was the 
governor of the state. He pacified the whole

02:09.699 --> 02:13.604
region. In what year did his father die? How old was 
I? I was 95. I was about 10 years old. My mother

02:27.115 --> 02:43.570
stayed in front of the family, and two older 
sisters were the ones who were working, being old

02:27.115 --> 02:43.570
ladies, to support us. I sweep the streets because 
at that time the owners of the houses had to sweep

02:44.866 --> 02:56.482
the streets every day. I sweep the streets in some 
houses to earn a few cents and help my sisters or

02:56.502 --> 03:14.147
help with some cents that they gave me also because 
I helped mass in a church. Con eso nos fuimos

03:14.701 --> 03:17.605
formando. Hasta que una de mis hermanas se casó. Se 
fue a México. Y entonces me llevó junto con otra

03:25.416 --> 03:34.750
hermana, la más chica. Y allí en México fue donde 
empecé prácticamente a maquiar. Allí entré de

03:41.520 --> 03:43.763
aprendiz. en una imprenta que se llamó American 
Book and Printing Company, que hacía todo el

03:44.232 --> 03:58.615
trabajo de los ferrocarriles en aquella época. De 
ahí fui progresando hasta que llegué a ser jefe del

03:58.635 --> 04:08.170
departamento recreativo. Entonces, There I met 
Mr. Ernesto Chiavero, who founded the first

04:10.675 --> 04:25.309
magazine for the place, an illustrated magazine 
called Arte y Letras. I sympathized with him, and

04:26.971 --> 04:36.440
then he put on his apron and took me there as her 
boss. There I was working until the newspaper, El

04:38.722 --> 04:51.760
Diario, was founded to compete with El Impartial, 
which was the main newspaper in Mexico. And then,

04:51.940 --> 05:03.056
in El Diario, I became the head of the workshops. 
From there, practically, The social

05:08.573 --> 05:17.365
struggle began to explode. I established the 
National Labor Chamber in Mexico

05:17.385 --> 05:32.446
in 1910.

05:33.928 --> 05:37.112
With that, the social struggle began. that was 
associated with the revolution. And

05:42.055 --> 05:52.365
to the triumph of Madero, they recognized us and we 
started to work. The Department of Labor was

05:53.126 --> 06:04.298
established by Don Francisco León de la Barra and 
we solved the first strike that took place. So they

06:04.970 --> 06:17.321
started working in accordance with the capital

06:04.970 --> 06:17.321
and the work. But after two or three years, Morones 
and other individuals came to defend themselves.

06:30.934 --> 06:33.036
We could now call them communists. And the fight 
between them and us began. Then, after Madero

06:37.452 --> 06:49.405
fell, we withdrew from the fight and the 
Moronistas

06:37.452 --> 06:49.405
stayed, right? They started to establish trade 
unions and to exploit the workers, inciting them

06:50.606 --> 07:01.437
to strike and fight. So then, the social struggle 
in Mexico was bifurcated. I, with the part... the

07:06.174 --> 07:15.708
part... How could we call it? Moderate,

07:15.728 --> 07:20.735
if you want. And Morones with the radical part. So, 
the fall of Madero came, and even Obregón came. And

07:31.943 --> 07:37.932
Jorones accompanied him with Obregón and the 
social struggle began. We could say that. And I,

07:41.798 --> 07:56.601
well, I incorporated myself from the opposite 
side to the death of Madero, who was already Don

07:41.798 --> 07:56.601
Venustiano Carranza, So I became a member of Don 
Venustiano. And since then I started my

08:03.996 --> 08:11.864
revolutionary

08:03.996 --> 08:11.864
struggle in Mexico. Then came the separation 
between Villa and Don Venustiano. Don Venustiano

08:18.812 --> 08:22.015
left Mexico and went to Veracruz. And I was in 
Puebla, always with Macabrasismo, and I

08:22.636 --> 08:39.613
established a newspaper called

08:22.636 --> 08:39.613
Nueva Patria. That newspaper was to take the 
workers down a path of reconciliation between

08:39.653 --> 08:50.263
capital and work. Tomando como tema principal 
para poderles meter en la cabeza a los

08:51.222 --> 09:10.361
trabajadores cuál era nuestro papel, adopté como 
ejemplo el desarrollo de una empresa de

08:51.222 --> 09:10.361
ferrocarril.

09:11.963 --> 09:21.212
Les empecé a demostrar que el capital y el trabajo 
debían de caminar como se construyen los rieles de

09:11.963 --> 09:21.212
una. for a railway. That if one deviates from the 
other due to little deviation, the society in

09:24.200 --> 09:42.979
general, which in this case simulated the machine 
for the cars, would deviate. And that was the

09:43.460 --> 09:48.685
danger of the clothes fight. se descargaría la 
sociedad y entonces tendríamos que ir al fracaso.

09:59.450 --> 10:14.807
Pero como luego vino el asesinato de... Entonces, 
cuando me metieron en México,

09:59.450 --> 10:14.807
me mandaron a Yucatán. and in Yucatán we 
established a newspaper, the newspaper was

10:15.428 --> 10:20.454
called Demócrata. From Mérida I went to San Juan 
Bautista, in Tabasco, and I also established the

10:20.515 --> 10:33.511
Demócrata. And once the social campaign was 
established in these two regions, I was ordered to

10:42.766 --> 10:56.148
go to Tapachula, in Chiapas, on the border of 
Guatemala. But in San Juan Bautista, I got a very

10:56.168 --> 11:04.622
strong paludism, and then I was ordered to go back 
to Mexico. I re-concentrated in Mexico with the

11:05.277 --> 11:14.845
column of General Don Pablo González. And Don 
Pablo... The general of Cabanza? Yes. So Don Pablo

11:21.391 --> 11:33.782
sent me to Puebla to establish also the labor 
campaign in favor of of the moderate movement.

11:39.169 --> 11:44.094
And I established there the immense unions of 
workers. I established the newspaper, which was

11:44.875 --> 11:56.848
also called El Demócrata. And already in Puebla 
came the electoral struggle Y se nombró el

12:01.572 --> 12:09.501
Congreso Constituyente, Congreso de Querétaro. 
Y en el congreso, en este congreso, fui yo

12:09.641 --> 12:20.534
representante por el distrito de Camachaco, del 
Estado de Ecuador. Ya, ya, entonces, Se siguió la

12:26.058 --> 12:36.157
lucha entre Obregón y Carranza hasta llegar al 
asesinato de Don Balistiano. Asesinado Don

12:36.258 --> 12:43.712
Balistiano, Don Pablo, que era mi jefe de hija, 
tuvo que venir a los Estados Unidos. And they

12:44.384 --> 12:48.988
started chasing us, the demonists. And that's 
when I had to leave Mexico to come here to the United

12:49.008 --> 13:00.980
States. In 1926. Since then, I've been here. I 
couldn't return to Mexico until General Cardenas

13:14.675 --> 13:37.122
But I didn't want to go because I already

13:14.675 --> 13:37.122
have my family, I already

13:14.675 --> 13:37.122
have my children here. For a few years, it was no 
longer worth it to move them to go to the

13:37.996 --> 13:50.283
revolution. Here I came and I started working with 
Ignacio Lozano in the press. And after three

13:57.352 --> 14:11.730
months of being here, he made me head of the press, 
the superintendent

13:57.352 --> 14:11.730
of the press. After a few years, after three or four 
or five years, I had a discussion with the father of

14:12.091 --> 14:25.047
Enrique González, who was the president of the 
press. And Don Ignacio was in Los Angeles. And

14:31.210 --> 14:37.137
there I told Don Ignacio to take me away from the 
press. And I took him away. I stayed on the street

14:40.461 --> 14:47.309
with three or four children to fight. And I started 
working with a small press. From there, step by

14:54.119 --> 15:00.968
step, we have

14:54.119 --> 15:00.968
come to this. That has been, in general terms, what 
I have been able to do. To educate my children, that

15:09.759 --> 15:20.413
they are grateful to this country, that it 
received them from childhood. They have occupied

15:20.630 --> 15:28.260
and played a very important role. And during the 
war, they have united as warriors. Without losing

15:33.927 --> 15:42.738
their love for Mexico, but always their loyalty to 
the country that educated them. That's how we are.

15:43.782 --> 15:49.270
Formado esta pequeña familia.

15:49.290 --> 15:52.835
¿Y toda su familia vivía ahora en San Antonio? 
Pues, el mayor está en Detroit. Allá tiene un

15:58.484 --> 16:01.869
taller de imprenta. Es presidente de la sociedad 
de oficiales. the retired chiefs and officers,

16:08.808 --> 16:20.404
because he spent 23 years in the army, and he left as 
lieutenant colonel. He retired and has a full job,

16:20.504 --> 16:36.486
and he continues to work as... he is in his 
services, in what is necessary in the army, of

16:20.504 --> 16:36.486
course. El otro segundo es este, Rubén. Este nada 
más sirvió su periodo y se vino conmigo. Y ha sido el

16:48.499 --> 16:56.489
que conmigo ha levantado el negocio. El turcero 
Guillermo está en Randolph Hill. No, Lackland

17:02.978 --> 17:04.600
Hill. They are also retired. She just retired. She 
was an assistant to the general and chief of all

17:12.954 --> 17:30.243
the air forces in the

17:12.954 --> 17:30.243
Pacific. Well, then... So, where are we now?

17:43.557 --> 17:43.898
Yes. Well,

17:44.279 --> 17:59.801
we established

17:44.279 --> 17:59.801
a society for teaching

17:44.279 --> 17:59.801
Spanish, right? Yes. And we

18:01.381 --> 18:11.332
created a... My daughter, my granddaughter. Nice 
to meet you. Nice to meet you too. My daughter is

18:17.459 --> 18:21.423
from a university. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet 
you. Thank you.

18:28.364 --> 18:56.194
Yes, yes.

18:58.250 --> 18:59.431
Tiene su historia. Como le dije a usted, cuando nos 
tuvimos que venir a los Estados Unidos, entré a

19:01.313 --> 19:12.404
trabajar a la prensa. Y allí me hice ese mal 
bendijo. A los tres meses, me nombró jefe de los

19:17.489 --> 19:23.635
talleres Don Nacho Lozano. Durante todo ese 
tiempo, pues, Estuve trabajando bien, pero llegó

19:28.034 --> 19:41.147
el momento en el que Don Ignacio fundó en Los 
Ángeles el periódico La Opinión. Y entonces, él se

19:42.248 --> 19:47.353
fue a vigilar allá. El papá de Enrique González, 
Don Leonides, quedó al frente del negocio de la

19:47.373 --> 19:57.163
prensa. But because of Angas or Marangas, as we say 
in Spanish,

19:58.325 --> 20:18.088
there was a disagreement between him and me, and I 
had to separate. So a real calvary began for me.

20:20.853 --> 20:25.719
Because my wife had to do the laundry. And the boys, 
Rafael and Rubén, who were already grown up,

20:26.259 --> 20:38.934
started selling a magazine called Liberty. And 
for every copy they sold, they gave them a coupon.

20:49.186 --> 21:02.485
Con el tiempo, llegaron a juntar una cantidad de 
copones y entré en el catálogo que les daban de

20:49.186 --> 21:02.485
premios a cambio de copones. Estaba una precita 
que cuando la vimos en el catálogo, me preguntaron

21:03.326 --> 21:16.544
los muchachos, papá, ¿quieres que pedamos esta 
precita? Sí, hijo, pídanla. Y pidieron la prensa y

21:19.240 --> 21:22.744
la tenían como juguete. Yo estaba trabajando. 
Pero vino el disgusto y me tuve que separar. Y

21:32.875 --> 21:41.444
entonces mi señora fundó un programa de radio que 
se llamó La Hora Estrella.

21:43.707 --> 21:45.889
Pero los comerciantes, In spite of the program, 
they began to ask that there be a male announcer,

21:47.641 --> 22:01.479
that it wasn't all announced by my wife. And then I 
asked for permission from Don Leonides to allow me

22:02.801 --> 22:12.433
to go out at 3 in the afternoon to help my wife. The 
program was from three to four. But we were in that

22:20.999 --> 22:28.229
when the displeasure

22:20.999 --> 22:28.229
came. And then we stayed. My wife had to be washed. 
And at that time there were factories where they

22:35.220 --> 22:40.227
cleaned nuts. And we also started to march, in 
short, as humbly as we could. And one night, when we

22:51.779 --> 23:09.640
didn't have anything to feed the creatures, like 
at 11 o'clock at night, my wife and I were sad to see

22:51.779 --> 23:09.640
that the boys had been taken to bed sin cenar, sin 
comer. Y me quedé viendo la fresita. Entonces le

23:18.540 --> 23:24.831
dije a mi señora, oye, después de todo, ¿por qué nos 
quedamos? Desde mañana tengo mi imprenta.

23:28.618 --> 23:31.002
Entonces me dice, ¿pero qué estás loco? ¿Con qué? 
Le digo, mira, That's going to be our salvation.

23:38.808 --> 23:43.154
That's going to be our imprint. No, you're crazy. 
We're going to sleep. The next day, very early, I

23:47.460 --> 23:56.733
went to see this man. What was his name? He was the 
agent of the Dillinger mills in New Brompton. here

24:06.303 --> 24:07.564
in San Antonio. And I told him, man, he was the 
announcer of the radio program of my lady. I told

24:19.158 --> 24:22.282
him, man, why don't we make a combination? To 
announce the flour, let's make some coupons. And

24:28.589 --> 24:36.158
those coupons, you give them to the merchants so 
that they give them to the consumers of the flour.

24:36.728 --> 24:41.675
He said,

24:36.728 --> 24:41.675
man, it's good. So we started to make up to 10,000 
popcorns. We did it on the square. The boys,

24:45.339 --> 24:54.972
instead of leaving school, and instead of going 
out with their friends, they came to help me with

24:45.339 --> 24:54.972
the machine. Well, that's how God did it. From this 
machine, we bought another one. a bigger one, and a

25:02.530 --> 25:08.239
bigger one, and a second-hand one, all broken, in 
short. We kept raising them until they reached

25:08.259 --> 25:12.285
you. So

25:12.305 --> 25:24.184
this is the basis of Mugia Principa.

25:24.204 --> 25:30.073
And this has drawn a lot of attention, this 
principle, right? They have been published on

25:31.808 --> 25:36.236
several occasions. In typography exhibitions in 
the schools, they come in the front.

26:03.230 --> 26:08.957
Ah, este es un artículo sobre usted. Sí. Sí? Ah, qué 
interesante.

26:33.875 --> 26:39.509
Is it possible for me to read this on the tape, 
please? Yes. To make a copy. Toy Presley to

26:42.336 --> 26:45.684
Prosperity by J.H. Pling, staff writer. Sit down. 
San Antonio Express, Sunday, September 30, 1951.

26:53.729 --> 26:57.456
One of the West Side's leading citizens is not a 
citizen. That seeming paradox simply means

26:57.636 --> 27:14.023
Rumalo Munguia, Sr., who parlayed a Tory press 
into a big print shop in Prospect Hill, has been

26:57.636 --> 27:14.023
accepting duties and obligations of citizenship 
minus the privileges such as voting. and so forth.

27:16.793 --> 27:35.438
You can read English in fields.

27:39.738 --> 27:52.054
He moved to San Antonio in 1926 as a political exile 
after taking the losing de la Huerta side in the

27:39.738 --> 27:52.054
struggle for power with the Obregon Calles 
Morones group. He and his family lived through the

27:52.094 --> 27:57.020
rough days of the Depression and stripped the 
bottom of their barrel of resources. But as he

27:57.481 --> 28:05.631
fought through it to his business success, 
Munguia said he became convinced that the United

27:57.481 --> 28:05.631
States is still a land of plenty of opportunity. 
Born in . Born in Guadalajara, Munguia got

28:08.527 --> 28:16.275
printer's ink in his blood as a young boy while 
working as an apprentice in El Sol Print Shop.

28:20.660 --> 28:31.014
He was in the thick of the revolution that broke out 
in 1910 against the political and economic

28:20.660 --> 28:31.014
oppression of Porfirio Díaz until 1920 when the de 
la Huerta group split with Obregón. Munguil was in

28:31.134 --> 28:36.421
the army as a public information officer setting 
up newspapers throughout the Puebla zone. He was

28:38.865 --> 28:46.515
named a delegate to the 1917 Constitutional 
Convention but did not attend because he was on

28:38.865 --> 28:46.515
active duty.

28:53.228 --> 28:55.490
Bueno, eso es muy interesante. Sí, muy 
interesante. Díganme un poco más sobre estos días

28:57.972 --> 29:02.476
cuando usted salió de México. Cuando usted viene a 
Texas, sí. ¿Cómo? ¿Cómo de qué? Pues más como sus

29:10.363 --> 29:14.447
experiencias durante estos días. ¿Es una cosa de 
peligroso o...? En 1926, cuando usted viene por

29:18.371 --> 29:21.794
Texas. ¿Cuando yo vine? Sí. It was precisely 
because Obregón was chasing me. And precisely the

29:29.623 --> 29:44.402
night that I crossed the border here, that night 
they looked for me in the house in Puebla to help me.

29:44.422 --> 29:48.767
They only found my wife and some children. So if I 
hadn't left Puebla the day I left, the next day they

29:49.591 --> 30:10.248
would have shot me in front of the house, in the 
Cerro de Guadalupe, in Puebla.

30:11.169 --> 30:19.176
So I arrived here precisely on the day of my saint, 
on the 11th of January, I came here in 1926, so if

30:19.223 --> 30:28.661
they had arrested me there, on the day of my death, I 
would have been executed. So that's when I started

30:30.645 --> 30:39.021
working here at the press. And your wife, how did 
she come to you? In October, I got the passports

30:44.461 --> 30:51.972
because I was already settled here, I already had 
my job. So I gave permission to the government to

30:51.992 --> 30:56.519
let me come. Yes. And there are no problems with the 
passport? No. So we didn't have any problems. And

31:08.954 --> 31:23.975
since then my wife came with Rafael, Rubén, 
Guillermo and Ylvira. They were the four children

31:24.015 --> 31:29.863
who came from there. The others were born here. 
Where are you from? Where in Mexico are you from?

31:38.353 --> 31:39.615
From Puebla. From Puebla? From Puebla. Did you 
meet her after you went to Puebla? Yes, when I

31:46.623 --> 31:52.470
arrived in Puebla with the revolution, that's 
where I met her. Yes. That's where I met her.

31:58.878 --> 32:00.139
Because she... When we went to Puebla, the country 
was more or less still. It was when the Constituent

32:09.752 --> 32:13.838
Congress was held in 1917. I was also the first 
councilor of the town hall and I was the director of

32:13.858 --> 32:27.679
the public welfare.

32:30.865 --> 32:37.154
until the mission of Obregón arrived and I had to 
come. Since then I have been fighting here. The

32:44.083 --> 32:53.616
first job, after I left the press, was when I 
started my social work, we could go here. And then

32:54.377 --> 32:58.543
we established the first school in the summer, in 
Spanish, for children to speak Spanish. Yes. At

33:06.129 --> 33:09.233
the Navarro School. Yes. Here in... It was here on 
Fecos Street. There, during the holidays, we had

33:14.819 --> 33:20.506
Spanish schools. That's nice. Yes. That's how we 
started. Then, after I started working, por

33:27.464 --> 33:30.709
establecer la biblioteca mexicana. Y logramos 
que se estableciera la biblioteca. Mandó a México

33:37.959 --> 33:41.284
algunos ejemplares y aquí se fue haciendo. Pero la 
cuestión política y las intrigas en las

33:42.206 --> 33:50.798
organizaciones siempre, ¿verdad?

33:51.900 --> 33:56.627
Se murió, podríamos decir, se clausuró la 
biblioteca. Y entonces pensamos en otra forma y

33:57.383 --> 34:17.629
establecimos los cursos de extensión 
universitaria de acuerdo con la Universidad de

33:57.383 --> 34:17.629
México. Todo eso pues lo tengo en archivo, 
¿verdad? Y fue por el año de 19... In 1940, we

34:26.932 --> 34:40.230
started little by little in a school, then in 
another school, the superior, then Bracken

34:26.932 --> 34:40.230
Ridge. From Bracken Ridge we went to Trinity, to 
Trinity and here, until we managed to

34:40.250 --> 34:53.968
definitively stay in Trinity.

34:54.573 --> 34:57.175
Here it is, here it is. Ah, dos palabras. Uno de los 
programas culturales

35:01.203 --> 35:24.783
desarrollados durante el año 1963 fue el 
presentado del 7 de julio por el doctor José San

35:01.203 --> 35:24.783
Martín de la estación radio de Cusura que debía 
EXTV. Sí. Sí. Yes, very interesting.

35:35.885 --> 35:40.690
About 50 years of Mexican culture in San Antonio, 
Texas. Excuse me, there's someone waiting for

35:40.710 --> 35:46.777
you. Do you want me to tell them where you're here? 
Yes, you can show them in. I guess it's my daughter.

35:56.448 --> 35:57.749
Mi hija está aquí. Oh, do you want me to bring her up 
here? Well, bring them both up here. That'd be fun.

36:02.174 --> 36:02.695
¿Es bueno? ¿Quieres encontrar con mi hija? Yo 
quiero... ¿Esto puede usted conservarla? ¿Es de

36:10.865 --> 36:14.068
Trinity University? Sí. Precisamente cómo se 
fundaron los cursos. Sí, sobre los cursos. Ah, sí.

36:27.481 --> 36:30.748
Y este es el trabajo de usted. Sí. Sí, qué bonito.

36:36.211 --> 36:47.263
Tell me a little more about your experience with 
Mr. Lázaro Cárdenas, the one you invited to come

36:36.211 --> 36:47.263
back to Mexico. Yes, Lázaro Cárdenas was a boy who 
was also an apprentice of printing, like me. Yes,

36:59.155 --> 37:00.717
yes. But then he came The revolution came and we all 
separated. And we didn't see each other again. But

37:12.883 --> 37:14.525
we brought the two of us. We were already created in 
the same school. We already felt the desire for

37:19.049 --> 37:23.674
improvement. He understood through the 
profession of the peasants and I through the

37:24.995 --> 37:33.403
industrial part. So we were separated, he by his 
side and I by mine, without any contact. But when he

37:44.054 --> 38:00.912
came to the presidency, the

37:44.054 --> 38:00.912
director of the national newspaper, Froylan 
Manjarrez, came in. And Froylan Manjarrez was

38:00.932 --> 38:03.795
a... a journalist who became the governor of 
Puebla, whom I initiated. I helped him to become a

38:18.827 --> 38:25.497
constituent deputy, also, for Atlixco. So when he 
came in, he got together with Cárdenas, So he

38:33.863 --> 38:36.186
remembered me. And then he called me. And then I 
told Prolán that he couldn't come. That he was

38:45.881 --> 38:48.745
already settled. And that I was taking care of my 
children. And that was the reason. That's how

38:55.936 --> 38:58.960
things are. I didn't come back with a political 
passion, but when Cárdenas came in for the first

38:59.277 --> 39:13.605
time, I received him. I have all the photographs 
that we took with him. I was with San Antonio all the

39:20.793 --> 39:27.623
time. Then he went to Russia and he got along with 
the communists. I didn't have any interest

39:38.038 --> 39:40.101
anymore. I told them, I'm more or less settled, my 
children are getting educated in a way that I don't

39:40.655 --> 39:54.730
want to go back. And then I dedicated myself to 
organizing here the festivals of May 5, September

39:55.451 --> 40:03.400
16, all organized by me. From all that I have 
photographs and data and everything. But it would

40:11.013 --> 40:20.045
be a very long question for you to see the process, 
right? Yes. But here you can see something of how it

40:21.127 --> 40:37.850
was done until it was finally achieved, that the 
university was established. I don't know if there

40:37.870 --> 40:39.332
is any here.

40:44.695 --> 40:49.242
Como les digo a ustedes, pues, tengo una casa. 
Estas son las carátulas de los programas que...

40:51.606 --> 40:58.817
Programa de fiestas patrias mexicanas.

41:01.662 --> 41:02.383
Sí.

41:17.905 --> 41:33.722
Sí, y también...

41:17.905 --> 41:33.722
Mi ciudad madre, Guadalajara. Su familia, toda su 
familia estaba de Guadalajara originalmente.

41:39.569 --> 41:39.849
Sí. Qué interesante. And my daughter,

41:45.952 --> 41:58.915
Mary Catherine.

42:12.968 --> 42:15.872
Ah, this one is also very interesting. I want to 
read it, yes. You can keep this one as an example.

42:21.200 --> 42:21.380
What? You can keep it as an example. For you. Oh, 
it's for me? Yes. Oh, well, thank you. But this one,

42:29.973 --> 42:31.075
no. This one, no. No, yes. Well, thank you. In this

42:34.159 --> 42:39.988
case, it is not necessary to read it.

42:56.320 --> 43:02.968
Well, do you know Obregón? I don't know Obregón. 
No? Never? No, never, because we were always on the

43:06.172 --> 43:10.297
opposite side. Obregón was in the north, and I was 
in Yucatán with the Barats. We were separated, but

43:16.845 --> 43:22.632
personally I don't know him. And you met Mr. 
Cárdenas. What kind of man was Mr. Cárdenas? Very

43:34.933 --> 43:36.956
well-intentioned. The same as Zapata. Zapata was 
such a good man. Very good that he was Zapata. He was

43:46.368 --> 43:49.952
naturally down there. No, no se puede controlar 
porque la revolución no se hace con gente decente.

43:56.089 --> 43:58.551
Se hace con el pueblo.

44:02.476 --> 44:11.166
Y tenemos que echar mano de lo malo para poder tener 
gente. Porque con gente decente no se hace la

44:11.186 --> 44:16.952
revolución.

44:17.253 --> 44:21.118
But you knew Mr. Zapata? Yes, I knew him. I knew 
Zapata, I knew his brother. I was in contact with

44:28.927 --> 44:33.192
many Zapatista bosses. Then some Zapatista 
bosses were with me. I was in contact with General

44:36.617 --> 44:46.028
Domingo Arenas, who was one of the most addicted to 
Zapata.

44:50.125 --> 44:51.206
Yes, yes. Zapata was a

44:51.226 --> 44:57.672
very good person. Well, during these years, from 
1920 to 1926, what kind of work did you have in

44:58.132 --> 45:07.741
Mexico? Since... After the revolution... I had my 
newspaper. Ah, yes. It's called... It's called

45:15.368 --> 45:16.429
The Liberal. Ah, yes. In Puebla? In Puebla. Yes.

45:22.526 --> 45:26.747
He had a little organ.
