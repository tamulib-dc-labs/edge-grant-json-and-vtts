WEBVTT

00:02.613 --> 00:09.983
So I said, you just go ahead and plan on making 
$10,000 worth of these one burner stoves. And I

00:11.705 --> 00:15.810
don't care how many it is, but give us a fair shake on 
it. He said, well, we'll do that. Well, hell, in

00:18.754 --> 00:32.552
about two weeks, he said, well, it looks like we're 
going to be able to make

00:18.754 --> 00:32.552
paying for the die costs and some other costs we'll 
be able to have for you about 360 or something like

00:33.106 --> 00:41.534
that for the $10,000.

00:43.556 --> 01:00.953
And he said additional stones after that would be, 
I think, $7

00:43.556 --> 01:00.953
or $8 or $9 a piece, something like that, on a 
negotiated basis. So I told the boss about it and

01:02.840 --> 01:08.145
told Colonel Moss about it, and he said, oh, that's 
fine, that's fine. Well, then I pulled a little

01:08.205 --> 01:12.069
shenanigans. I convinced the guys to write into 
the G4 annex for the landings in North Africa that

01:13.330 --> 01:30.906
every armored vehicle and every armored 
personnel carrier and every command car have one

01:31.696 --> 01:43.870
of these one-burner gasoline stoves for 
provision of providing hot rations for the

01:31.696 --> 01:43.870
troops. Well, after they figured out what that 
would amount to based upon the T-O and E of the units

01:43.890 --> 01:59.509
that were scheduled for the North African 
operation, it amounted to some 10,000 odd units.

02:00.400 --> 02:11.431
And to make a long story short, it wasn't very long 
after that we got the authority to go ahead and buy

02:00.400 --> 02:11.431
that many plus some more for maintenance and 
follow on and so forth. And you've been a friend of

02:11.451 --> 02:13.553
the Coleman's ever since. And then after that, 
why, the one burner stove was this, about that time

02:13.573 --> 02:27.927
Ernie Pyle, the reporter, was in North Africa. He 
mentioned in one of his stories about this one

02:28.902 --> 02:32.366
burner stove. Sheldon Coleman called me on the 
phone. He said, say, Ernie Pyle has mentioned

02:36.792 --> 02:42.278
about your one burner stove. He always referred to 
it as your one burner stove. And I said, yeah.

02:48.025 --> 02:48.706
Somebody told me. I didn't see the article. He said 
the employees in the factory would like to send him

02:51.802 --> 03:01.995
one, specially made stainless steel with his name 
engraved on it and everything. Can you get it to

03:02.536 --> 03:04.999
him? And I said, well, I'm pretty sure I can. So they 
did. A beautiful one-burner stone, exact

03:08.644 --> 03:16.655
facsimile, all fancied up with stainless steel 
engraved and everything. And I got it over to him.

03:25.113 --> 03:25.894
thanking me for. And he said, it's so pretty that 
I'll never use it. I'll always just use one that I

03:29.098 --> 03:34.484
can, a regular GI stove that I can use. And when he 
was killed in the Pacific, we looked and looked and

03:36.006 --> 03:43.736
looked to try to find that stove. But because the 
Coleman Company wanted to put it on exhibit out

03:44.637 --> 03:50.564
there perpetually. But we never, we never found 
it. We contacted the unit that he was with. And I

03:57.875 --> 04:00.197
don't know what happened to it. Somebody's got it 
somewhere. But anyway, the little one burner

04:03.100 --> 04:10.287
stove is really the, I got a great personal 
satisfaction out of that little thing. Because it

04:10.788 --> 04:12.870
served a great purpose. And really, really was 
really a helpmate to a lot of people. And I got, as a

04:22.927 --> 04:27.311
result, like you say, I was very friendly with 
Coleman. And they wanted me after the war. They

04:31.475 --> 04:39.402
offered me a hell of a fine job to go to their 
Canadian operation in Montreal. And I was to be the

04:40.744 --> 04:44.287
number two man then. And they said that the number 
one man was scheduled to retire in about three

04:44.307 --> 04:50.993
years,

04:53.605 --> 04:59.653
But I

04:53.605 --> 04:59.653
didn't do it. I went in the service, the regular 
service. And Sheldon, it kind of upset him that I

05:03.998 --> 05:18.177
didn't take it because he had paved a lot of streets 
and paved a lot of way for me to come in at that level.

05:19.899 --> 05:22.262
But we're still friends and good friends about it. 
But it was something that we gave birth to, and

05:23.693 --> 05:34.345
everybody was against it because we don't have a 
requirement for it. And nobody wanted to stick

05:34.405 --> 05:39.872
their neck out and say, let's accept. We finally 
convinced a couple of the powers that be at that

05:39.932 --> 05:46.680
time to go along with it. What other types of 
projects did

05:55.233 --> 06:22.371
Right about that, a little after that too, and I've 
got a patent on that, we, in the shipment of

05:55.233 --> 06:22.371
gasoline for invasion and for follow-on, the 
gasoline, we need, not in the shipment, but in the

05:55.233 --> 06:22.371
handling of gasoline in the field, even with a 
pipeline operation, There's a great military

06:22.975 --> 06:28.825
necessity for the five gallon can, jerry can. 
Well, shipping those five gallon gasoline cans,

06:28.845 --> 06:42.749
and we also had five gallon cans to carry water, but 
the big requirement was for gasoline cans, five

06:28.845 --> 06:42.749
gallon gasoline cans. And as some of our petroleum 
pipeline distribution companies we would have

06:47.900 --> 07:07.077
what we call decanting operations where at the 
terminal, at the pipeline, they would have

06:47.900 --> 07:07.077
thousands of cans that would be filled and units 
would come up and pick up a truckload full of filled

06:47.900 --> 07:07.077
cans and then bring in a truckload of empty cans. 
So, shipping those cans overseas was quite a

07:09.619 --> 07:17.046
logistic thing because what you're doing is 
shipping a ship full of air because you've got

07:17.768 --> 07:32.755
empty cans and early in the day a lot of people said, 
well why don't we fill them with some kind of dry

07:17.768 --> 07:32.755
subsistence, what kind of subsistence? Beans or 
something like that and it never was very feasible

07:32.935 --> 07:39.507
to do that. So I got the idea, let's ship the cans 
knocked down but nested. In other words, ship a can

07:49.419 --> 08:03.434
that was almost complete except for one side, put a 
slight slant on the sides of the can so you could

07:49.419 --> 08:03.434
nest them. And then the end, the top or the end, you 
could stack them up. And then overseas, one of the

08:10.604 --> 08:21.699
ordinance companies could set up a line, a welding 
line, and they could assemble the finished cans.

08:22.280 --> 08:30.351
Drop in the closure, have that all in one piece, so 
just drop it in and spot weld it. The handle would

08:31.175 --> 08:33.578
already be on it. No, the handle you could spot weld 
it on. And the body of the can would be nested,

08:37.102 --> 08:40.886
stacked up. And he then just put the top on them and 
run a bead weld around it. And they already had

08:46.292 --> 08:53.740
automatic, a little simple field expedient 
machine that could run a bead weld around it. So the

08:55.171 --> 09:03.161
idea was so good that the military patented the 
thing in my name for their exclusive use. And for

09:04.583 --> 09:12.232
any commercial use after the military didn't want 
it, it would become my property. So a patent was

09:13.114 --> 09:17.439
issued and everything for this nested gasoline 
can. Several million were procured. and shipped

09:23.065 --> 09:27.870
overseas and assembled just like we envisioned. 
And then after the war some were sold surplus and

09:29.091 --> 09:46.908
there were some produced after the war that I was 
supposed to have gotten a royalty on but I never did

09:29.091 --> 09:46.908
get it. One of the companies that made them I, at 
that time, I wasn't really interested in spending

09:53.305 --> 10:02.255
a lot of money legally to try to get a few pennies of 
can out of it. But anyway, I got a lot of

10:02.275 --> 10:07.901
satisfaction out of it, this nested can. The only 
other real projects that I was involved in, which

10:09.743 --> 10:20.055
have kind of carried over into civilian life after 
the war, I was particularly interested and

10:20.913 --> 10:48.878
involved in aviation fuel safety, as far as the 
military is concerned, and wrote some of the early

10:20.913 --> 10:48.878
comprehensive handbooks and manuals on military 
aviation fuel safety, particularly as it applies

10:20.913 --> 10:48.878
to jet fuel, turbine fuel. because turbine fuel

10:49.685 --> 10:56.052
is sort of a morphidite. It's not a gasoline and 
it's not a kerosene. It's a mixture of both. And

11:03.880 --> 11:15.912
military jet fuel

11:03.880 --> 11:15.912
in the early days and even today is a very dangerous 
jet fuel in that at all ambient temperatures found

11:17.039 --> 11:33.561
on Earth, and even up to 50,000, 60,000 feet, the 
vapors from JP4, which is military jet fuel, are

11:17.039 --> 11:33.561
always in the explosive range. And military jet 
fuel has an almost unknown, un-understood

11:47.448 --> 12:03.966
characteristic of the generation of static 
electricity that nobody knows why it generates so

11:47.448 --> 12:03.966
much static electricity when it flows, when you 
pump it or when you transfer it or even when you pour

11:47.448 --> 12:03.966
it out of a can. The molecules in military jet fuel 
bumping one against the other and flowing when you

12:04.907 --> 12:17.320
pump them through a pipeline or pump them into a 
tank. have the characteristic to generate static

12:17.857 --> 12:25.889
electricity in pretty high, pretty high amounts, 
pretty high voltage amounts. Which means the

12:26.910 --> 12:28.793
possibility of fires? The possibility of 
explosion and fire. And the only way to prevent it

12:31.897 --> 12:40.409
is to properly ground both the refueling unit and 
the unit being refueled. Ground them to a common

12:40.930 --> 12:42.953
bond.

12:46.426 --> 12:57.266
So we alerted and helped alert a lot of military 
usage of the safety and the handling of jet fuel. I

12:57.286 --> 13:06.443
then became, in the 60s, early 60s, became 
involved with a civilian organization. known as

13:06.541 --> 13:08.764
the Airways Club. It was headquartered in New York 
at that time. It's now headquartered in Dallas and

13:11.989 --> 13:17.157
known as the Airline Passengers Association.

13:20.662 --> 13:25.910
It started out and still is a source of permanent 
airline insurance. You can buy airline insurance

13:25.990 --> 13:30.837
from Airline Passengers Association. Instead of 
buying an individual policy each time, But

13:35.903 --> 13:42.353
anyway, they ran a newsletter about airline 
safety. And I made a comment to them one time about

13:42.373 --> 13:55.553
the use of jet fuel in commercial airlines, the use 
of military jet fuel in commercial airliners,

13:42.373 --> 13:55.553
which they published in their newsletter and got 
pretty wide distribution. It caused quite a furor

13:55.633 --> 14:00.240
in civilian aviation. And a lot of people said that 
I was just throwing up smoke screens to scare

14:01.115 --> 14:08.685
people and so forth. What did it say? I said that the 
use of military jet fuel in commercial airliners

14:10.968 --> 14:20.660
was a very, very dangerous practice. And that 
there was the possibility of in-flight explosion

14:20.680 --> 14:27.409
and destruction of the aircraft. Well, I'm sorry 
to say that's exactly what happened in 1961, a Pan

14:28.402 --> 14:45.387
Am 707 returning from San Juan to Philadelphia at 
an interim stop at Friendship Airport in

14:28.402 --> 14:45.387
Baltimore. It had been refueled in San Juan with 
JP4.

14:52.978 --> 14:57.244
It flew to Friendship Airport in Baltimore and 
stopped And they did not top off the main tank. The

15:03.474 --> 15:06.459
main tank was about half full. All the tanks were 
full when they left San Juan with JP4. They did not

15:11.766 --> 15:22.362
top off the main tank, which was about half empty, 
nor did they top off any of the wing tanks. The wing

15:22.382 --> 15:26.708
tanks had been drawn down equally to keep the trim 
on. Both of the wing tanks were about half full and

15:29.405 --> 15:38.958
of course the wing tanks have a vent to the outside. 
The main tank was about half full because they only

15:40.079 --> 15:48.591
had a short distance to fly then from Baltimore to 
Philadelphia. They took off from Philadelphia

15:49.973 --> 15:55.260
with all of the tanks partially full. And they 
encountered very, very severe turbulence and a

15:56.573 --> 16:04.062
very severe electrical storm. And just a few 
minutes out of Baltimore, over Elkton, Maryland,

16:04.082 --> 16:18.800
a lightning struck the aircraft and ignited 
vapors coming out of one of the vents. I think it was

16:19.501 --> 16:21.383
a left wing tank. Ignited, and then through some 
faulty arrangement of the vent or faulty

16:26.324 --> 16:41.367
functioning of the vent valves, the fire and 
explosion fed back into the tank and exploded the

16:26.324 --> 16:41.367
left wing tank and destroyed the airplane. 
Seventy, I think sixty some odd people were

16:41.387 --> 16:46.074
killed. The FAA picked up the pieces from the early 
description. It sounded like there was an

16:53.024 --> 16:55.588
in-flight explosion. The FAA picked up the pieces 
of this airplane and put them in the hangar in

16:56.648 --> 17:05.397
Bowling Field in Washington so they could be 
examined. That's what they do today in a crash is

17:05.437 --> 17:10.923
pick up all the pieces like a jigsaw puzzle. And it 
was very plain what had happened because the wing

17:10.943 --> 17:19.272
tanks were blown out and the skin and everything 
was peeled back. So it ignited and fire fed into the

17:20.573 --> 17:25.238
main tank. And this proved, this was a living proof 
of some of the theories that had been set forth

17:26.500 --> 17:37.096
about the possibility and the hazards with 
military jet fuel. So after Elkton, some of the

17:38.518 --> 17:46.731
airlines stopped using military jet fuel. Now, 
they used military jet fuel whenever they could.

17:52.640 --> 17:53.822
for several reasons. Number one, the biggest 
reason, it was cheaper. It was much cheaper than a

17:57.207 --> 18:04.299
Jet A or Jet A-1, which were the civilian jet fuels. 
You're immediately gonna say, well, why isn't the

18:05.401 --> 18:13.714
military jet fuel as safe as the civilian jet fuel? 
The answer is, at that time, and I think it's still

18:13.734 --> 18:19.103
true today, military jet fuel is very easy to make, 
very simple to make. And it's very easy to make in

18:26.906 --> 18:40.357
the large quantities that the military would 
require, or that the military air forces in the

18:26.906 --> 18:40.357
free world would require to fight a world war. 
Whereas Jet A and Jet A-1, which are really and

18:41.378 --> 18:49.225
truly aviation kerosene, are more expensive and 
we can make less of them. Out of every barrel of

18:55.384 --> 19:06.038
crude oil, we can probably make about 20 gallons of 
military jet fuel. Whereas out of every barrel of

19:06.058 --> 19:18.655
crude oil, we can probably only make about seven 
gallons of civilian jet fuel because of the mix of

19:06.058 --> 19:18.655
the fractions that go into it. Military jet fuel is 
so easy to make. You can take some of the diesel

19:22.001 --> 19:32.373
elements and some of the gasoline elements in 
storage tanks at refineries and blend them as they

19:22.001 --> 19:32.373
load a tanker. They actually make military jet 
fuel while they're loading the tanker. Pump out of

19:37.619 --> 19:41.263
this tank, pump out of this tank, pump out of this 
tank. The few additives they put in, such as

19:41.604 --> 19:48.051
anti-corrosive and anti-water additives, add 
them in. And it's all dumped into the tank and the

19:48.385 --> 19:55.253
holes of the tanker and becomes military jet fuel, 
JP-4. It's very easy to make. I know my son at Fort

19:57.796 --> 20:06.546
McPherson in a science project, a science fair 
project, I had him make military jet fuel. And he

20:07.287 --> 20:13.294
made it in the house there, and I got him all the 
little fractions, and he made it into fair. And he

20:14.496 --> 20:18.240
showed them how I would test them. So I was much 
involved in that in civilian life and even some of

20:19.452 --> 20:43.986
it spilled over in the military when I said one day 
that MATS, Military Air Transport Service,

20:19.452 --> 20:43.986
should not fly dependents in 707s

20:19.452 --> 20:43.986
that had JP-4 in them. And finally I said that the 
White House fleet

20:56.155 --> 20:59.018
to haul the president around and all the VIPs. One 
day, I got an anonymous call and did a briefing in

21:00.039 --> 21:07.346
the Pentagon one day. General

21:08.187 --> 21:19.177
LeMay said, who in the hell is this guy Kinderdine 
to tell us what kind of fuel we ought to use? But I got

21:20.258 --> 21:22.701
an anonymous call one day. This was before I 
retired. yeah this was in 65 or 66. And they said

21:31.345 --> 21:46.665
you'd be very interested to know that the order was 
given this morning that Air Force One and all

21:31.345 --> 21:46.665
aircraft in the VIP fleet at Andrews henceforth 
would not use JP-4 anymore.

21:52.889 --> 21:56.094
So I told the Airways Club about it. I called New 
York and told them. I said, well, the military is

21:57.857 --> 22:03.025
starting to break now on this thing. And they 
called the White House. The Airways Club called

22:08.013 --> 22:19.892
the White House and wanted confirmation of this 
rumor that was floating around that Air Force One

22:08.013 --> 22:19.892
and all of the VIP fleet would henceforth not use 
military jet fuel anymore for safety purposes.

22:25.965 --> 22:28.288
And they refused to confirm it. They refused to 
confirm or deny it. They said, we can do neither.

22:35.777 --> 22:41.164
But in about a week, there was a little 
announcement in the paper that they're going to

22:35.777 --> 22:41.164
use it. Well, anyway, they've changed the specs a 
little bit for military jet fuel. It's a little bit

22:46.210 --> 22:49.795
safer now, but it We've lost a lot of aircraft in the 
military. Where you've read aircraft exploded

22:54.227 --> 23:03.644
shortly after takeoff or something like that 
because of the volatility of JP-4. Now in your

23:04.706 --> 23:11.057
Vita, it says that you worked on several projects 
with the Alaskan and the European theaters.

23:36.873 --> 24:03.353
And some of the projects in European theater 
during the war, the

23:36.873 --> 24:03.353
only, well after the war I did some special work in 
the European theater on special purpose

23:36.873 --> 24:03.353
facilities which included underground 
facilities and the like that I probably should not

23:36.873 --> 24:03.353
comment on.

24:10.471 --> 24:13.394
and even within connection with some of our 
allies. But I during the war then and in my my I was

24:15.796 --> 24:39.060
assigned to service forces and did some duty with 
the Third Army with Patton's group and not

24:15.796 --> 24:39.060
long enough for my own satisfaction and Then I was 
back over in Europe. I came home in late 45 and then

24:43.901 --> 24:51.392
went back over there during the occupation in 
Germany. Okay, but were you stationed in Europe or

24:51.552 --> 24:55.739
were you stationed in Washington? I was stationed 
in Washington. Throughout the whole war you were

24:56.920 --> 24:58.142
in Washington. Most of the time I was assigned in 
Washington.

25:13.432 --> 25:18.619
And what you were doing was helping them lay the 
pipe, basically? No, I had nothing to do with that.

25:20.662 --> 25:22.405
No, this was all in... These were different. This 
was all in logistic and planning and operational

25:23.266 --> 25:30.376
things. Mostly,

25:30.436 --> 25:38.848
well I did this before the Normandy landings, I did 
a lot of work in the and the G4 annex of the landings

25:39.419 --> 25:44.252
in Normandy. And then after that, I was in on 
several projects in Europe.

25:59.129 --> 26:07.884
I was never assigned to a specific like the umpty 
umpt army or the umpty umpt brigade. I was always

26:07.904 --> 26:21.306
assigned in a staff to the headquarters third army 
or headquarters service forces Europe or

26:07.904 --> 26:21.306
something like that.

26:24.931 --> 26:29.037
After the war, I was back over in Europe during the 
occupation. And then while I was there during the

26:30.319 --> 26:34.866
occupation, the Berlin Airlift came along. Yeah, 
in 1948. Yeah, and I was very, very much involved in

26:36.468 --> 26:41.355
the Berlin Airlift. Okay, but before we get to the 
Berlin Airlift, which I certainly want you to talk

26:41.516 --> 26:49.147
about because it's so important. How about right 
after the war was over, did you think at that time

26:55.238 --> 27:03.088
Now you might go back to civilian life, or did you, 
by that time, did you made up your mind that you

26:55.238 --> 27:03.088
wanted to be a career officer? I had not positively 
made up my mind that I wanted to be a career officer

27:03.769 --> 27:12.440
because I had this opportunity to go to work for the 
Coleman Company. What rank were you at that time? I

27:14.423 --> 27:15.564
was a full colonel. I was a full colonel. I got my 
Eagles after VE day. In fact, they were pinned on me

27:24.905 --> 27:35.642
in Paris under the Arc de Triomphe by some of my 
buddies, yeah.

27:36.202 --> 27:46.398
I was not, I had not made up my mind that I wanted to 
become a career officer because I had this this

27:36.202 --> 27:46.398
Coleman thing. I had the possibility of another 
job with this big industrialist Ludwig, you may

27:51.989 --> 27:56.558
have heard of. He owns most of the tankers in the 
world today. Has extensive operations in South

28:00.485 --> 28:07.538
America, in mining and offices in New York. One of 
my buddies went to work for him. I could have gone to

28:11.566 --> 28:14.892
work for him and I could have also I'm pretty sure I 
could have gone to work for the General American

28:15.310 --> 28:25.968
Transportation Company that operates most of the 
tank cars in the United States, that owns most of

28:15.310 --> 28:25.968
the tank cars. What about going back to West Texas 
and getting back into the oil field? I thought

28:31.437 --> 28:38.128
about that too, but the oil business just kind of 
moved so fast during the war

28:42.108 --> 28:48.977
and the technology and everything just had 
quantum jumps.

28:52.142 --> 29:08.284
I could have gone back to Norville Wilder, the 
supply house, because Lipp Norville came to

28:52.142 --> 29:08.284
Washington and said that he wanted me to come back 
here to the Fort Worth office or to their office in

28:52.142 --> 29:08.284
Shreveport. So I, but very quickly after the war, I 
made the decision, I think I'll put in for the

29:09.749 --> 29:22.292
Regner Army, because they announced the 
integration program. Why did you make that

29:23.093 --> 29:24.476
decision? What was it about the military that was 
so attractive, even though you had a number of

29:24.896 --> 29:29.825
excellent job offers? Yeah, I don't know.

29:34.690 --> 29:39.354
I had a lot of success during the war, a lot of 
personal satisfaction. I had personal

29:40.515 --> 29:56.889
satisfaction and personal success

29:40.515 --> 29:56.889
that very few people, very few of my peers were able 
to, I think, experience as much of as I did. And it

29:58.390 --> 30:03.194
just kind of got me. I just liked it. And I

30:05.318 --> 30:20.675
knew that a peacetime army or that a post-war time 
army, the activities would be grossly different

30:05.318 --> 30:20.675
from what they were during wartime.

30:24.679 --> 30:26.741
But I felt that I could adapt to it. And I don't 
really know. My folks, my wife liked the service.

30:37.544 --> 30:38.566
What did she like about it?

30:42.752 --> 30:44.655
I think she liked the variety about it. You know, 
you stay at a place two or three years and then you go

30:45.397 --> 30:49.223
for something else. We moved 22 times. And she 
liked that. And my kids liked it. They liked the

31:02.727 --> 31:09.333
going places and meeting new friends and new 
people. My daughter went to three high schools.

31:13.697 --> 31:19.442
She would have gone to four, but we left her in Paris 
to graduate after we came home.

31:23.186 --> 31:32.194
I think they were, I think my family was more or less 
motivated and challenged by military life. And I

31:33.845 --> 31:41.773
think particularly my son, he too wanted to study 
military history. And he wanted to teach military

31:42.754 --> 31:44.596
history. He went to Duke and went there through his 
junior year. And

31:50.803 --> 32:02.215
I said, look, what the hell can you do after you 
graduate except maybe work for Hanson Baldwin or

31:50.803 --> 32:02.215
somebody like that? And I said, why don't you get in 
the business school? I said, I know Art Weimer out

32:05.971 --> 32:08.233
in Indiana. And he's the dean of the School of 
Business. And I believe you can transfer out

32:12.058 --> 32:15.501
there. And he hadn't done too well at Duke. He's a 
real good student. And I said, you can transfer out

32:23.270 --> 32:27.695
there. And he got in a little trouble down at Duke. 
And I said, why don't you just check into them and go

32:31.186 --> 32:43.360
on out to Indiana this summer and go to summer 
school and maybe you can catch up and you'll be

32:31.186 --> 32:43.360
right even with your class then. So he did. We drove 
out there. He went to summer school and he was 4-0 in

32:46.904 --> 32:51.509
summer school. He carried a real heavy load and he 
did real well. But I think they were motivated by

32:57.764 --> 33:04.292
the service, even though they were just 
youngsters right after the war. But they liked the

33:05.614 --> 33:09.019
military, and my wife liked it. So I made the 
decision and took my board, my regular Army

33:10.220 --> 33:18.491
integration board in San Antonio, Fort Sam 
Houston. Were you fearful right after the war that

33:19.412 --> 33:24.058
you might be demoted

33:31.801 --> 33:37.310
except those that had attained permanent rank, 
and most of them were just about ready to retire. So

33:38.752 --> 33:44.741
I was demoted to a lieutenant colonel when I was 
integrated. Matter of fact, about a month before I

33:45.963 --> 33:52.854
was integrated, and there was several thousand on 
the same demotion list. And I was a lieutenant

33:53.896 --> 33:59.985
colonel for, I guess, about five years then before 
I became a colonel. Was that demoralizing in any

34:01.923 --> 34:04.285
way? No, no, it wasn't then. No, not at all. It was, 
you know, it's something that you understand in

34:08.309 --> 34:25.907
time of war with a large force structure and why

34:08.309 --> 34:25.907
the higher ranks are filled by rapid promotion 
during the war. You could be promoted every six

34:26.628 --> 34:28.890
months. Sure. some occasions promotions were 
quicker, but normally every six months you were

34:32.264 --> 34:39.536
promoted, almost like clockwork. And it

34:41.139 --> 34:54.762
was an expected thing, and so there was no problem 
at all to So, and I look back many times on this

34:56.547 --> 35:17.492
thing, and I know many times, you know, nostalgia, 
you think about, well, I suppose he would have gone

34:56.547 --> 35:17.492
back in the oil business, might be a 
multi-millionaire today, because some of the

34:56.547 --> 35:17.492
guys that you worked with or started out with made 
it big. But I think when you weigh everything, the

35:18.994 --> 35:25.322
personal satisfaction and the joy and the feeling 
of accomplishment that you get. I really believe

35:29.770 --> 35:37.502
that if I had the decision to make again today, I'd 
do the same thing. I really believe I would. Let's

35:40.847 --> 35:42.670
talk now about the Berlin Arrow left. Tell me about 
it. Okay. Well, I think here again, I've been awful

35:45.654 --> 35:51.563
lucky in my military career. At this time, you were 
director of supply? I was director of supply of the

35:54.533 --> 36:01.500
largest depot in the European theater of 
operations. Where was that in Germany? It's in

36:05.624 --> 36:07.166
Gießen, Germany. It's not that now. It was then. 
It's in Gießen, which is about 40 miles north of

36:10.349 --> 36:17.116
Frankfurt, off the Autobahn, right off the 
Autobahn. The G-I-E-S-S-E-N, Gießen, Gießen.

36:22.610 --> 36:28.658
And it was a German airfield, big German airfield 
that we built this depot on. It was kind of like a

36:28.818 --> 36:30.740
saucer. And the airfield was down in the bottom of 
the saucer. And of course, when it rained, the

36:34.525 --> 36:39.391
water, we had water and mud in the depot. And I lived 
in the commanding officer, the German commanding

36:40.352 --> 36:51.807
officer's house, a nice big stucco house right in 
front of the gate to the airfield. And

36:53.356 --> 36:59.662
like I say, I was lucky. Here's a case where I

36:59.682 --> 37:06.389
guess I was at the right place at the right time. 
Because things were going from bad to worse. Would

37:13.396 --> 37:16.079
you like a drink or a Coke or something? Yeah, I 
would. Let me get that. You want a Coke or what? In

37:21.672 --> 37:22.674
the airlift. Yeah, let's continue with the 
airlift. Like I say, me personally, my personal, I

37:25.157 --> 37:30.706
was just a lucky guy. I was at the right place at the 
right time. I got a call in my office from

37:32.308 --> 37:50.076
Heidelberg, the headquarters of the U.S. Army 
Europe, about 1

37:32.308 --> 37:50.076
o'clock, right after lunch, telling me to... go 
down to Ryan Main Airport in Frankfurt, Air Base in

37:50.663 --> 38:03.976
Frankfurt, and represent the Army at a meeting 
that was going to be presided over by General

37:50.663 --> 38:03.976
LeMay. I think he was head of the Air Force in 
Europe. And of course, the tensions had been

38:08.900 --> 38:16.207
getting stronger and stronger over access to 
Berlin. The Russians had threatened and had

38:16.227 --> 38:20.451
closed the Autobahn and the only thing that was 
open was the rail line into Berlin and the air

38:21.157 --> 38:27.247
corridor into Berlin. So I asked, I think it was the 
G-4 officer, maybe it was the G-4 of the command, I

38:29.750 --> 38:42.270
asked him what the nature was and he said, well I'm 
not real sure, but it's a classified subject, it's

38:42.740 --> 39:09.473
a classified meeting and he said you just better go 
ahead and you're representing the army and he said

38:42.740 --> 39:09.473
if there's anything real controversial that you 
don't feel competent to handle, give me a ring and I

38:42.740 --> 39:09.473
said okay, so I went and I got down there just as 
quick as I could, about 40 miles, took me about an

38:42.740 --> 39:09.473
hour to get out there and General LeMay opened a 
thing by saying that General Clay, who was the

39:11.005 --> 39:38.785
Supreme Commander then, had been contacted by the 
Joint Chiefs and by the White House and was told to

39:11.005 --> 39:38.785
be prepared to start sending aircraft into Berlin 
with supplies for Berlin, for everybody in

39:11.005 --> 39:38.785
Berlin,

39:45.937 --> 39:58.753
And that the Air Corps, the Air Force, it was the Air 
Force by the end, the Air Force had already ordered

39:45.937 --> 39:58.753
additional transport aircraft to come to 
Germany. There were some that were going to start

39:59.734 --> 40:06.062
later that evening from as far away as Alaska, some 
four-engine C-54s. Some were coming from Gwilas

40:06.903 --> 40:13.851
in North Africa, and some were coming from 
England, And even they were going to use a few C-47

40:15.147 --> 40:22.216
twin-engine, but he hoped to use only four-engine 
aircraft. And

40:24.299 --> 40:29.786
he said, the Army is represented. And he said, 
where is the Army? I had introduced myself to him

40:31.828 --> 40:38.256
when I came in and told him I was a G-4, asked me to 
represent the Army. And he said, it's going to fall

40:39.778 --> 40:44.344
upon the Army to furnish the cargo. to fill these 
airplanes up this first day. And he asked me, he

40:48.979 --> 40:53.103
said, how much cargo can you give me? And I said, 
well, General LeMay, how much would you like to

40:53.163 --> 40:57.808
have? And that kind of put the ball back at him. And 
he said, well, he said, for the first day, I'd like

41:01.972 --> 41:09.119
to have at least 500 tons. Because I'm going to have 
all my four-engine aircraft I'll be able to put

41:14.733 --> 41:21.285
about eight to nine tons gross in those 
four-engine C-54s. And depending upon what it is,

41:23.269 --> 41:32.185
the cube and so forth of it, he said, I'm hoping that

41:47.453 --> 41:51.341
And then, of course, we'll need more cargo each day 
thereafter. But he said, tonight, I'd like to have

41:51.361 --> 42:04.428
enough to load what aircraft that we think we're 
going to be able to initiate the airlift with.

42:04.448 --> 42:06.492
And I said, well, do you have any idea

42:22.418 --> 42:28.103
And I said, you have no desires or no requirement or 
no specification of what you want to fly. He said,

42:28.383 --> 42:30.826
we'll leave that up to you. So I said, fine. Now, he 
said, well, how much can you give me? And I said,

42:38.252 --> 42:45.599
General LeMay, I will lay down on this airfield 
tonight for you, by midnight, 500 tons of cargo. He

42:46.119 --> 42:47.120
said, that's good enough. So I said, if I may be 
excused, I'm

42:54.818 --> 42:55.899
to my command. So I called Heidelberg and told 
them. And they said, well can you do it? I said,

43:00.544 --> 43:02.346
yeah, it'd be no problem at all. They said, well 
what you gonna ship? And I said, well I haven't

43:04.528 --> 43:11.056
really crystallized, but you know, I think I'll 
ship the ingredients to make bread. Because the

43:12.257 --> 43:14.940
easiest goddamn stuff to load. We can ship a 
balanced requirement. Canned milk and yeast and

43:17.663 --> 43:21.687
flour and sugar and And there's even in the 
military ration, once a week, they bake raisin

43:22.544 --> 43:26.989
bread. And of course, I didn't mention that. But 
what I'm going to tell you in a minute or two will

43:29.672 --> 43:33.877
bear that out. So I called. And after, they said, 
that's fine. And they said, god damn, be sure you

43:37.561 --> 43:43.768
get it there at least by 1 or 2 o'clock in the 
morning. I said, it'll be here by midnight. So I

43:47.191 --> 43:48.653
hung up.

43:55.923 --> 44:01.809
chief of operations to stand by and I didn't know 
what the hell was going to come out of this meeting.

44:02.430 --> 44:24.613
So they were all waiting for me and I said well we 
need 500 tons and I said I want you to make a run on the

44:02.430 --> 44:24.613
on the IBM and get the tonnage and get all the all the 
print out on the just divide it up and let's shift

44:02.430 --> 44:24.613
500 tons of all the ingredients to bake the 
military bread program. And they said, what? And I

44:29.049 --> 44:31.413
said, make bread. All the ingredients to make 
bread. They said, well, that's a cinch. I said, I

44:35.499 --> 44:38.082
know it is. And I said, you better have all those DP 
companies. Well, we used three or four companies

44:42.629 --> 44:49.499
of displaced persons as laborers in the depot 
there. It was so big. Still as late as 48? Yeah.

44:52.302 --> 44:53.184
Really? There were still DP's hanging around? We 
had several thousand DP's, Poles and Czechs, that

44:55.948 --> 45:02.219
hadn't gone back. Not any Russians? No, we didn't 
have any Russians. We had some Poles and DP's. And

45:06.727 --> 45:08.309
they didn't want to go back? I don't think they 
wanted to go back. Most of them were involved in the

45:09.812 --> 45:16.403
black market and shacked up with Frauleins and 
everything.

45:18.526 --> 45:23.375
But were they working for you, or were they working 
for us as labor units? And were they on payroll?

45:26.100 --> 45:26.361
Yeah. They were living in a quasi-military 
surrounding, but working for us and making a

45:27.443 --> 45:38.003
monthly wage as labor troops. And I said, better 
alert several of those truck companies in Geesen.

45:45.502 --> 45:51.418
We had a dozen or so truck companies that were all 
black truck companies.
