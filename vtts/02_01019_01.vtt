00:01.600 --> 00:09.711
by David White of Texas A&M University on April the 
22nd, 1989, concerning the Vietnam War. In the

00:10.472 --> 00:18.202
interest of accumulating knowledge about the 
war, I'm going to donate this tape to the Texas A&M

00:10.472 --> 00:18.202
Oral History Collection in the University 
Archives. Is that all right with you? That's fine

00:19.464 --> 00:20.786
with me, David. All right. And you are, of course, 
Tom Rugg. You were born when? May 5th of 1948. So

00:28.972 --> 00:32.537
would you classify yourself a baby boomer then? I 
think I'm right on baby boomer age, yeah. And you

00:37.083 --> 00:38.144
were born where? In Denver, Colorado. Denver, 
Colorado. Were you up there? No, I didn't. I grew up

00:43.451 --> 00:45.474
all over the country. My dad was and still is in the 
oil business, in the engineering end of it. And

00:51.502 --> 00:54.326
they seemed to think it important that you move 
periodically. So we did. So where did you end up

00:56.528 --> 00:59.493
spending your high school years? My sophomore 
year in high school I spent in Wichita, Kansas. My

01:04.662 --> 01:08.348
junior year in high school I spent in Oklahoma 
City, Oklahoma. And my senior year in high school I

01:08.608 --> 01:11.934
spent in Hobbs, New Mexico. New Mexico. So you 
really weren't near any of the What would be

01:20.862 --> 01:27.371
traditionally classified as the hot spots of the 
nation, like Berkeley or New York or any of those

01:20.862 --> 01:27.371
places? No. Now, what do you remember about 
Kennedy? What was your first recollection of

01:33.118 --> 01:34.801
Kennedy? You must have been 12 years old at the 
time. Yeah, I guess my first recollections about

01:37.765 --> 01:43.933
Kennedy...

01:45.027 --> 01:46.929
would have been at about age 12. And I guess the 
strongest recollection and impression I have

01:47.330 --> 02:02.647
about John Kennedy was the fact that he was a 
Catholic, which my parents seemed to think, in the

01:47.330 --> 02:02.647
political scheme of things, was extremely 
important, they being Protestants. They thought

02:03.428 --> 02:07.393
it was important in a negative sense. So they were, 
in a sense, against Kennedy for that reason. Well,

02:12.938 --> 02:18.305
my parents were and always have been very closely 
aligned with the Republican Party. So John

02:18.325 --> 02:26.597
Kennedy being the nominee of the Democratic Party 
was not going to be their favorite son in any event.

02:26.617 --> 02:29.300
But the fact that he was Catholic was very 
important. And I remember from my own personal

02:33.509 --> 02:37.695
perspectives at that age that he was a very 
impressive figure. I thought his accent was a

02:37.715 --> 02:45.787
little strange and the way he said words was funny, 
but I still think that about Massachusetts

02:37.715 --> 02:45.787
people. I see. Now, you mentioned your parents 
were Republican. Would that say they were

02:49.872 --> 02:51.234
conservative? Yes, I would classify them as 
conservatives then and now. Were you, to an

02:58.705 --> 03:02.250
extent, influenced by your parents' views, or 
were you... offset by it? Yeah, I think it probably

03:05.141 --> 03:07.346
went the other way. Certainly, pre-teenager, I 
was influenced by their views. But as I reached

03:12.436 --> 03:22.416
teenage status and on towards adulthood, I think I 
became much more rebellious in my attitude toward

03:12.436 --> 03:22.416
my parents. in my views today are in a lot of 
respects very much opposed to the kinds of

03:23.662 --> 03:33.336
conservative traditional political views that 
they held and still hold. What do you think was the

03:34.198 --> 03:46.296
major turning point during your pre-teen high 
school years that sort of made you turn away from

03:34.198 --> 03:46.296
your parents' conservative views? I'm not sure I 
can pinpoint. any one thing. It may be a part of just

03:52.645 --> 04:00.415
the natural growing up process that all 
adolescents go through. The desire and want to be

04:00.455 --> 04:12.729
independent and the need to develop and assert 
your own identity is inherently inconsistent

04:00.455 --> 04:12.729
with adopting parental views. But I can't 
pinpoint any single event or period of time. when I

04:19.923 --> 04:23.326
became more rebellious towards my parents. Would 
you have classified yourself as an interested

04:24.708 --> 04:31.575
teenager? Meaning that, did you keep up to date 
with world events and national events and such?

04:38.882 --> 04:39.763
Oh, yeah. That was something that seemed to just 
naturally be a part of whatever group I was with of

04:41.044 --> 04:48.732
peers. Those were important events to the people 
that I ran with, and I guess so far as I knew,

04:48.897 --> 04:58.592
although I would have had no way to know different, 
they were important to everybody. Do you remember

05:00.535 --> 05:04.221
watching any of the civil rights marches on 
television? Oh, yeah. Very much so. What were your

05:05.944 --> 05:08.087
impressions?

05:09.485 --> 05:17.913
I guess you get a little different perspective 
about the civil rights movement when you're not

05:09.485 --> 05:17.913
stuck in any one place. Let's pause this thing for 
just a minute. So we were talking about civil

05:22.056 --> 05:23.698
rights. Continue, please. Yeah, for example, you 
got different views from different parts of the

05:25.580 --> 05:30.925
country. Wichita, Kansas was a very interesting 
town and was then very racially polarized. The

05:40.726 --> 05:59.283
part of Oklahoma City when I was in my junior year in 
high school that I was familiar with was not,

05:40.726 --> 05:59.283
although I do have some very distinct 
remembrances and impressions about the first

05:40.726 --> 05:59.283
black students to come to the high school when I was 
there. And then Hobbs, New Mexico, there was a one

05:59.343 --> 06:05.108
high school town, a much smaller community, And

06:05.712 --> 06:14.004
the community attitude was, you know, black 
people were black and white people were white.

06:14.044 --> 06:15.646
Nobody paid it much attention. It wasn't a big 
issue. So depending on where you were, that was the

06:18.470 --> 06:22.936
kind of backgrounds you were being exposed to. And 
I think my attitude was one kind of amusement. I

06:26.862 --> 06:27.923
never really... understood how you could form any 
definite opinions or attitudes about people

06:28.240 --> 06:36.570
based solely on their appearance or the color of 
their skin. And I don't know where that attitude

06:36.630 --> 06:38.332
came from. Certainly not necessarily a 
traditional conservative attitude. So would you

06:43.499 --> 06:52.510
say that growing up in that, going to school in that 
one high school town sort of helped to solidify

06:53.384 --> 06:57.869
your views on race relations, just to the point 
where it doesn't matter? Yeah, I think that was a,

06:58.871 --> 07:18.594
certainly of the communities that I grew up in, 
that was far and away the best community in terms of

06:58.871 --> 07:18.594
not having racial tension or racial issues be 
important, and that's a much more comfortable

06:58.871 --> 07:18.594
atmosphere to live in. What do you think about 
Kennedy's attitude towards civil rights? Well, I

07:26.513 --> 07:28.777
don't know. I guess I thought, you know, at that 
point in time, I'd never lived in the South, the

07:29.177 --> 07:40.255
Deep South, which seemed to be the focus of an awful 
lot of the racial problems. The big cities seemed

07:40.355 --> 07:44.942
to be the other focus outside of the South. And I 
guess it sort of seemed like to me that that his

07:51.535 --> 08:00.469
approach to racial issues, at least as I 
understood it, one of equality fit with my idea of

07:51.535 --> 08:00.469
what America was all about. I guess I agreed with 
him. I never really had much of a problem with it.

08:06.238 --> 08:08.120
You mentioned what America was all about. What was 
America all about? Well, to me, America was all

08:10.544 --> 08:18.977
about everybody gets an even shot and a fair shake 
and right wins and wrong loses. pretty idealistic

08:19.936 --> 08:35.779
attitude, I guess, but I think it's a right one and 
one, I think, that still prevails is my attitude

08:19.936 --> 08:35.779
about America, although I've learned that for 
right to prevail can be a long and hard struggle and

08:19.936 --> 08:35.779
doesn't happen overnight. I see that. He said 
everyone deserved an even shot and a fair shake.

08:44.000 --> 09:03.677
Yeah, and I thought that America was designed to 
give that opportunity to people, and I think still

08:44.000 --> 09:03.677
does in the overall generic sense, although in 
individual cases there are certainly going to be

08:44.000 --> 09:03.677
sharp contrasts and differences and 
opportunities if you focus on the individual. But

09:04.258 --> 09:07.324
if you look at the country as a whole, As a general 
rule, a person's ability to achieve and succeed

09:08.384 --> 09:19.288
and be happy generally depends on individual 
choices that an individual is more or less free to

09:08.384 --> 09:19.288
make. You know, there are some outside 
constraints on choices that may be reflected or

09:20.197 --> 09:30.291
affected by background or community or things of 
that nature. But in the overall sense, as a big

09:30.311 --> 09:38.383
picture, basically the choices you make dictate 
the happiness you have. Did you think at the time

09:40.746 --> 09:46.474
that everyone should have this all over the world 
or just Americans? I never really thought much in

09:47.129 --> 09:51.834
terms of world politics and still don't, I guess.

09:54.856 --> 10:06.828
I know I went through a period of time where it 
seemed like to me the type of government, the name

09:54.856 --> 10:06.828
you hang upon on a particular type of government 
probably wasn't all that important. But if it was,

10:06.868 --> 10:14.115
it was in another place far removed from anything 
that I cared much about. in a lot of ways

10:14.652 --> 10:18.176
characterized my attitude about the Vietnam War. 
You know, it's halfway around the world. I figured

10:20.740 --> 10:23.543
those people had a right to self-determination. 
They ought to work it out themselves. When was the

10:25.626 --> 10:28.449
first time you remember hearing about Vietnam? I 
can't remember the first time. Obviously it was in

10:31.573 --> 10:38.923
high school because we had the draft in those days. 
And people of draft age were being sent to Vietnam,

10:42.496 --> 10:48.385
and they were fighting there, and they were dying. 
And that was true in the early 60s and became much

10:48.685 --> 10:59.000
more true in the later 60s as I approached draft age 
and graduation from high school. And I know at some

10:59.060 --> 11:06.431
point in time in there, it was probably the single 
most important topic that young men talked about.

11:07.673 --> 11:11.338
So you would classify your feelings in high school 
concerned but apathetic? I was apathetic towards

11:15.012 --> 11:17.399
Vietnam as a country. I think I still am. It doesn't 
matter to me whether Vietnam is under the

11:20.367 --> 11:28.129
influence of a communist form of government. or a 
populist form of government or a democratic form

11:28.700 --> 11:32.985
of government, I don't care. It just doesn't 
matter to me. It seems to me that that's a problem

11:35.027 --> 11:42.256
for the people who live in Vietnam to solve their 
own way in whatever way it takes to solve that. I

11:42.316 --> 11:45.860
don't think it's any of my business to intervene or 
interfere in that. So that was my attitude about

11:47.642 --> 11:51.286
Vietnam as a country and as a people. My attitude 
about U.S. involvement in Vietnam was very much

11:51.807 --> 11:57.053
different because that was very personal and was 
becoming more and more personal as time went by

11:57.455 --> 12:05.446
because it had a significant possibility of 
affecting me directly. Would you say at the time

12:07.132 --> 12:08.899
you had a great fear of death? Well, let's say that I 
certainly wasn't looking forward to ending my

12:09.925 --> 12:21.268
life on a premature basis, although I think like 
many teenage boys, occasionally I did some things

12:09.925 --> 12:21.268
that would make you wonder if I really believed 
that. But as a general proposition, death was sort

12:21.348 --> 12:29.865
of an unknown thing and something that I thought 
should happen to old people and not young people. I

12:30.026 --> 12:31.208
still think that's true. Did you know personally 
anyone in high school that was drafted before you

12:31.711 --> 12:39.741
graduated, say someone from the class or two ahead 
of you? Now that was, I guess that was one of the

12:40.161 --> 12:47.610
things I was insulated from because in three years 
I was in three different cities in three different

12:40.161 --> 12:47.610
states. I lost track of the older people. And I have 
an older sister who's two and a half years older

12:50.153 --> 12:59.524
than me, so she was far enough removed that her 
friends were not people that I really knew. You

13:00.112 --> 13:05.622
know, being two years apart in high school is like a 
lifetime away from each other. So no, I didn't, at

13:05.722 --> 13:19.908
the time I registered for the draft, the people I 
knew who were registered for the draft and being

13:05.722 --> 13:19.908
drafted were my peers, people the summer I came out 
of high school were the people I knew who were being

13:05.722 --> 13:19.908
drafted.

13:22.793 --> 13:23.875
Now, so you... You were of draft status. Let me ask 
to put it to you this way. What was your draft status

13:28.360 --> 13:30.963
when you left high school? I believe they called it 
1A back in those days. You were the hot number. You

13:39.494 --> 13:43.960
knew that when you got out of high school that the 
odds are you were going to be called up. Sure. Well,

13:45.622 --> 13:51.330
you didn't know what the odds were in those days, 
but you were certainly a draft status eligible

13:45.622 --> 13:51.330
student. And for a combination of reasons, 
college student deferments were very much

13:51.952 --> 14:01.140
available in the early 60s. And by the time, as were 
married deferments in the early 60s, if you were

14:01.340 --> 14:08.286
married, they wouldn't draft you. As we reached 
the mid-60s, and I graduated in 1966, suddenly

14:08.306 --> 14:16.032
student deferments became very elusive for some 
people. And married deferment by then had been

14:16.873 --> 14:19.295
dropped altogether. So there were a number of 
things. you could do to try to go on with your life

14:23.339 --> 14:33.313
that didn't guarantee your life wasn't going to be 
interrupted by a call from the Selective Service

14:23.339 --> 14:33.313
System and you entering the military. So you were 
1A when you got out of high school? I was 1A when I got

14:37.659 --> 14:40.503
out of high school. What were your thoughts when 
you got out of high school? Were you planning on

14:43.047 --> 14:44.489
going to college? Oh, I went to college 
immediately. I started the summer but I graduated

14:48.702 --> 14:51.866
from high school and went directly into college. 
Where was that? At New Mexico State University.

14:55.089 --> 14:57.392
And so you had a 2S deferment? No, I did not. I was 
never able to quite put a handle on why it was my

14:59.534 --> 15:12.990
draft board refused me a student deferment 
status, but they did, and I was never 2S throughout

14:59.534 --> 15:12.990
the existence of the draft. It was a rather strange 
set of circumstances. I always suspected that

15:19.803 --> 15:28.818
because I had registered late for the draft, that 
perhaps I had gotten a special flag on my record.

15:28.838 --> 15:32.443
But at any rate, I applied for and was denied 
student deferment status. Was there any

15:34.727 --> 15:36.790
particular reason why you registered late? Well, 
at that point in time, I know that I was very

15:38.112 --> 15:44.663
reluctant to register for the draft. I had 
formulated a definite opinion by that point in

15:45.487 --> 15:59.350
time that the war in Vietnam was wrong for America, 
probably wrong generally, but wrong for me

15:45.487 --> 15:59.350
personally. My father made me register for the 
draft. He was right. It was the law. I needed to do

16:04.057 --> 16:04.859
it. So I was late.

16:09.787 --> 16:15.273
While you were going to school at New Mexico State, 
you were still in danger of being drafted. Oh,

16:15.834 --> 16:17.515
absolutely. And at the end of my second semester, 
they tried to draft me. What happened? Well, the

16:23.762 --> 16:35.174
first effort they made at drafting me, I got a 
letter in the mail and decided that maybe New

16:23.762 --> 16:35.174
Mexico wasn't such a good place to be. My folks had 
moved to Beaumont, Texas by then, and I thought it

16:38.491 --> 16:41.015
would be a good time to visit, so I did. Did you 
withdraw from school? No. I visited down here and

16:44.780 --> 16:58.560
contacted the local draft board here to have them 
transfer my draft papers from Lovington, New

16:44.780 --> 16:58.560
Mexico to Beaumont, Texas. They started without 
question, started the paperwork, the wheels in

16:59.821 --> 17:04.448
motion, whatever government forms they had to 
fill out, they filled those out and fired them off.

17:09.200 --> 17:13.006
I told them I was going to be a permanent resident 
here. Very shortly after that, I was only here a

17:13.427 --> 17:17.893
couple of weeks, I went back to New Mexico State 
University. And by moving back and forth, just

17:19.455 --> 17:27.668
simply attempted to have the Selective Service 
System lose Tom Ruck. They did for a period of time.

17:33.476 --> 17:34.738
After And I forget what it was. It was a month or two. 
They found me through my grandmother Rugg in

17:39.529 --> 17:51.986
Denver, Colorado, who's now deceased, who called 
my parents in Beaumont who were in a panic wanting,

17:39.529 --> 17:51.986
grandmother was in a panic wanting to know why the 
Army was looking for me. I wasn't in the Army. And

17:55.090 --> 17:57.092
called my parents in Beaumont. And my dad turned 
the tide again. and told me that basically this

18:00.706 --> 18:04.771
wasn't the way you played the game with these 
folks. You could end up in prison doing this kind of

18:04.791 --> 18:07.715
stuff. And I actually underwent a pre-induction 
physical for the military in El Paso sometime

18:07.795 --> 18:19.149
during my third semester, which would have been 
the spring of 67. You went into your physical.

18:23.154 --> 18:24.416
Yeah, I flunked the physical. That was the only 
good thing that happened to me. In my experiences

18:27.079 --> 18:29.582
with the military, I ran across some military 
doctors, and apparently these guys had a

18:30.035 --> 18:36.424
tremendous attitude. You can't believe this, 
knowing that probably half the guys who were there

18:36.464 --> 18:48.580
for their pre-induction physical, or maybe more, 
were there basically against their will and

18:36.464 --> 18:48.580
desires. These guys acted like I was going to have 
some tremendous disappointment if they didn't

18:49.080 --> 18:56.811
pass me on my physical and let me into the military. 
I had an acne condition. that had, as many

18:58.908 --> 19:02.714
teenagers do, and it was on my chest and arms. And 
they decided that military clothing would

19:03.195 --> 19:08.464
aggravate that condition. I thought just the 
style of military clothing was going to aggravate

19:09.325 --> 19:13.031
my attitude. But they decided to give me a medical 
deferment for one year. It was called a one-wide

19:18.901 --> 19:21.105
deferment. And they gave me a one-wide deferment. 
from the military. So for about a year or so you were

19:25.150 --> 19:29.294
basically off scot-free? Yeah, the deal was you 
were supposed to go back after the end of the year,

19:29.695 --> 19:39.505
they'd send you a notice, you'd come back and take a 
physical again and they'd decide if you were fit to

19:29.695 --> 19:39.505
go at that point. Well, I moved to Beaumont again. 
At the end of that spring semester, a combination

19:42.709 --> 19:49.396
of events, I really had to move to Beaumont again. 
The school had found out that my parents No longer

19:52.081 --> 19:57.347
lived in New Mexico, therefore I managed to attain 
non-resident status. And the tuition went up,

19:57.748 --> 19:58.989
obviously. The tuition increase was staggering, 
and I couldn't afford school there, so I came to

19:59.009 --> 20:04.796
Beaumont. Got a job and went to work. Had my papers 
transferred again back to the Beaumont draft

20:09.121 --> 20:17.110
board, and went to work for That summer and the next 
school fall semester, I entered Lamar the

20:18.338 --> 20:23.683
semester after that. You said the other guys at the 
draft board were generally not in a mood to be going

20:25.285 --> 20:34.675
to the draft board and saying, hey, I want to come 
in? Oh, the guys that were there for the physicals?

20:36.837 --> 20:37.137
Yes. Oh, yeah. Of course, you always have and you 
always will have I suppose you always will have,

20:44.714 --> 20:48.798
the people who are really gung-ho military types. 
And they're fine. Everybody's got to do their own

20:50.980 --> 20:52.362
thing. It'd be dull as hell if we were all alike. And 
you had those kind there who were not students, had

20:55.926 --> 21:05.435
graduated from high school, and were looking for a 
place to go, and they were going to land in the

20:55.926 --> 21:05.435
military. But you had a lot of students or people 
who had flunked out of college, people who were not

21:13.267 --> 21:18.754
terribly interested in the military, who were 
also there for their physicals. You know, you had

21:19.655 --> 21:25.542
some conversations with the people in your close 
physical area. I mean, they must have run through

21:25.702 --> 21:28.065
200 at a time. But you had some conversations with 
people on, hey, who are you, why are you here, that

21:29.006 --> 21:33.892
kind of thing. Enough to know that I wasn't the only 
person there who didn't want to be. Would you

21:37.415 --> 21:49.312
characterize their feelings as just general, I 
don't want to go over there and die, or were they

21:37.415 --> 21:49.312
specifically saying what we're doing is wrong, I 
don't want to go, I'm a conscientious objector,

21:37.415 --> 21:49.312
that sort of thing? No, I think there was a lot of, 
you had a lot of the people who it was really more of a

21:49.432 --> 22:02.150
fear and apprehension of the prospect of going and 
getting in a war and getting shot at and killed. The

22:02.851 --> 22:03.692
really strong, true, conscientious objectors I 
don't think ever saw the pre-induction physical

22:04.567 --> 22:12.196
process. I think a lot of those people ended up in 
other countries, if the draft board could ever run

22:12.557 --> 22:18.704
them down. This is a bit off the subject, but you 
were, being in El Paso, you were close to Mexico.

22:25.493 --> 22:29.537
Did the thought ever occur to you of maybe going 
over to Mexico and hanging out for a while? No, the

22:29.557 --> 22:32.481
thought occurred to me to go to Canada. economic 
situation in Canada is a little bit more conducive

22:33.119 --> 22:47.873
than it is in Mexico, plus your chances of 
speaking, running into people who speak the

22:33.119 --> 22:47.873
English language who are natives of Canada are 
significantly higher. And then there were rumors

22:48.834 --> 23:00.105
going on then that if you went to Mexico and got 
caught, it wouldn't do you any good because the

22:48.834 --> 23:00.105
Mexicans would just send you back anyway, and that 
the Canadians wouldn't. Now, whether or not any of

23:00.608 --> 23:07.536
that was true or not wasn't as important as what you 
believe was true. So Canada was a consideration,

23:07.636 --> 23:12.361
just depending on how this draft thing went. I did 
know that if I passed the pre-induction physical,

23:12.762 --> 23:17.207
they weren't going to force me to stay on the base. I 
would have an opportunity to leave and be expected

23:17.287 --> 23:20.190
to come back. So I had some time to work with 
formulating a final plan. An escape hatch, as it

23:26.037 --> 23:27.679
were. Yeah, I had a way out if it got to that. Did you 
have one in mind when they told you to come on to the

23:30.207 --> 23:35.653
base? Suppose they had not given you the one Y that 
day, what was your immediate option? Well, I was

23:40.919 --> 23:44.343
really looking at a couple of options. All of them 
involved leaving, which would have been fairly

23:44.744 --> 23:49.789
easy for me to do then. I had a car and I could get 
everything I owned in the car and was used to

23:49.809 --> 23:55.516
traveling. It wasn't any any real problem for me to 
hop into a car and just take off. I could certainly

24:02.456 --> 24:03.957
have done that. I didn't really want to do that. I 
had lots of friends in school, and I really wanted

24:05.499 --> 24:11.244
to stay in school and work on my education at that 
point in time. So I didn't have any final battle

24:13.566 --> 24:15.448
plans. I was just kind of going along. You know the 
thing that's really scary about all that, now that

24:17.169 --> 24:27.619
I'm nearly 41, is I'm afraid that if I'd have passed 
the physical, the absence of a real defined plan

24:28.055 --> 24:47.112
and a thing to do, I may have just followed along 
like sheep to the slaughter, which is the feeling I

24:28.055 --> 24:47.112
get happen to a lot of people who didn't want to be 
there and ended up going just because they didn't

24:28.055 --> 24:47.112
have any other alternatives that they were ready 
to pursue. I think I've jumped ahead a little bit.

24:51.315 --> 24:52.697
Do you mind if I backtrack a little? No, not at all. 
We've gotten as far as your years of getting into

24:57.333 --> 24:58.635
the draft to 68. I want to backtrack a little bit to 
64. OK. What was your first memory of LBJ?

25:08.488 --> 25:12.313
Oh, I guess being sworn in as president after 
Kennedy's assassination.

25:14.616 --> 25:16.739
See, I wasn't a Texan then. The last time I'd lived 
in Texas, I was too young to remember. And I'd lived

25:20.404 --> 25:25.230
out in Kermit and McKamey, way out in West Texas. 
That's before I even went to school as a toddler. So

25:29.933 --> 25:32.957
LBJ didn't mean anything to me. I do remember the 
swearing-in ceremony, but I had no real

25:33.077 --> 25:46.974
impressions or knowledge of him or his politics or 
anything else about him. Now, that changed as you

25:46.994 --> 25:49.497
got older, I take it. Yeah, it became fairly 
obvious that for one reason or another, whether he

25:49.831 --> 26:10.505
was making the choices or his advisors were 
convincing him it was the right thing to do, that

25:49.831 --> 26:10.505
Vietnam had gone from a fairly minor skirmish out 
in the woods somewhere to a major full-blown war

25:49.831 --> 26:10.505
that they were trying to call a police action. 
Things just got totally out of hand under his

26:10.765 --> 26:16.935
leadership or lack of leadership, whichever way 
that really went. Do you remember any of the

26:18.755 --> 26:29.897
specific military operations being discussed in 
the news, like their announcing of the bombings,

26:18.755 --> 26:29.897
Rolling Thunder, stuff like that? Yeah, I have 
some dim memories of that kind of stuff, of the

26:30.338 --> 26:40.138
bombings of Hanoi and North Vietnam in general. 
unauthorized raids into Cambodia and Laos,

26:40.321 --> 26:45.708
places where they weren't supposed to be. I had 
never had any doubt in my mind of the military's

26:45.748 --> 26:52.917
capability to do things they weren't supposed to 
do. I never, in any sense, doubted the

26:52.937 --> 26:59.686
truthfulness of any of those stories. Of course, I 
was a detractor from the war effort anyway, or a

27:01.729 --> 27:05.974
non-supporter, I guess. So anything bad coming 
out of Vietnam in the way of news, I believed

27:06.528 --> 27:14.180
instantly without any real critical analysis.

27:17.545 --> 27:25.057
Before the time you graduated high school, had any 
thoughts crossed your head of maybe going out and

27:17.545 --> 27:25.057
protesting or doing something active? No, and 
that may have been, nobody was doing that in Hobbs,

27:26.319 --> 27:30.446
New Mexico. What about Oklahoma City? It really 
hadn't gotten to that level in Oklahoma City, at

27:34.102 --> 27:43.314
least not in my age group, which would have been 
high school junior. High school senior certainly

27:43.715 --> 27:55.130
would have had some possibilities the way the war 
was developing by that point in time, but not in a

27:43.715 --> 27:55.130
town of 20,000 people with one high school. That's 
just not the sort of thing that those size

27:56.612 --> 28:02.320
communities lend themselves to. Now, is New 
Mexico State located in Hobbs, or is it located

28:02.435 --> 28:07.843
in... No, it's in Las Cruces. Las Cruces. Which is 
several hundred miles away in another very small

28:08.764 --> 28:11.829
town. What was the student atmosphere like at New 
Mexico State, your first fall or spring semester

28:13.271 --> 28:18.679
there? Well, the first semester there was summer 
school, which is, as I'm sure you know, isn't any

28:18.980 --> 28:28.974
real impression of what a campus and a university 
is really like. So the first real semester would

28:28.994 --> 28:31.378
have been the fall semester. of 66

28:32.388 --> 28:56.251
and New Mexico State University then was 
primarily an engineering school

28:32.388 --> 28:56.251
and I don't guess it still is but a very serious 
studious type of student body and not one really

28:32.388 --> 28:56.251
given much to protesting at that point in time. 
Although one wouldn't have described Lamar

28:57.072 --> 29:02.277
University then as one either and we had some dandy 
protests. So you'd say that, by and large, these

29:02.712 --> 29:08.602
people were wrapped up in their studies. Yeah, and 
I think a part of that was probably as much the time

29:09.944 --> 29:14.451
as anything else. The real serious war protest 
movement was starting in other places and was

29:14.511 --> 29:29.496
going to take a while to filter down to some of your 
smaller campuses and universities. What was the

29:29.915 --> 29:34.981
first major college protest you remember? I 
remember Kent State, but I can't tell you when it

29:35.001 --> 29:39.928
even happened. It's really odd. You know, that was 
a big deal. So you don't remember hearing about

29:44.654 --> 29:50.481
anything like that while you were at New Mexico 
State? No, I don't remember there being any big

29:50.501 --> 29:56.188
protests at New Mexico State. Not the three 
semesters that I was there. So then you came to

29:59.868 --> 30:03.773
Beaumont and began working. What was the attitude 
like in Beaumont at the time? I know it's a town that

30:07.056 --> 30:17.328
would be classified as part of the old south, 
but... Yeah, and I don't know that I can even tell

30:07.056 --> 30:17.328
you. You know, when the first time you hit a town to 
live, you're 19 years old, it's pretty difficult

30:19.811 --> 30:28.221
to get oriented. You don't have a group to go into. 
You're not going to school. I lived here the first

30:32.977 --> 30:39.966
summer with my parents, and then they moved off 
again in the ongoing pursuit of never moving. It

30:40.446 --> 30:42.008
was a part of my dad's profession. And I don't know 
that I had a sense of what was going on in Beaumont. I

30:47.635 --> 30:49.277
was pretty wrapped up in my own deal. As soon as I was 
sure that I'd lost the draft board and that they

30:49.537 --> 30:58.208
really weren't going to try to find me and drag me 
off kicking and screaming out of the night from my

30:49.537 --> 30:58.208
apartment, I was pretty secure with most of that. 
Went on about trying to get my own life ordered.

31:09.468 --> 31:13.172
So you went to work, and then you ended up enrolling 
at Lamar. Yeah, I enrolled at Lamar. Let's see,

31:15.794 --> 31:20.520
this would have been the spring semester of 68, I 
guess. 68. Those were funny times. What was it like

31:24.344 --> 31:28.448
at Lamar back in spring 68?

31:31.853 --> 31:41.204
You know, I don't know that I have any real hard, 
specific things that I can remember that would

31:31.853 --> 31:41.204
give me a sense of it all. I lived on campus, which 
made me one of the unusual folks for Lamar, as

31:41.624 --> 31:51.056
opposed to New Mexico State, where the only place 
you could live was on campus. And that's just

31:52.217 --> 31:55.501
because there wasn't any other housing 
available, basically. There was a little bit, but

31:55.521 --> 31:59.666
90% of the student body lived on campus. At Lamar, 
it was completely reversed. So

32:02.684 --> 32:15.416
there were people, the people that I knew were a 
pretty small part of the campus, and those were the

32:02.684 --> 32:15.416
folks who lived on campus. I don't know, I suppose 
things were crazy at Lamar like they were

32:15.616 --> 32:21.522
everywhere else back in 68. People going between 
studies, having a good time, and being worried

32:23.264 --> 32:29.670
about the wars and things like that. Let me 
backtrack a bit for a sec. You said 90% of the

32:32.467 --> 32:39.293
students at NMSU lived on campus, so you were in the 
dorms. Yeah. Did y'all ever get together and rap

32:40.714 --> 32:47.781
about your draft statuses, for example? Yeah, I 
guess that's when I, certainly New Mexico State's

32:48.942 --> 33:00.332
when I found out that everybody up in New Mexico 
State except me, so far as I knew, everybody had a

32:48.942 --> 33:00.332
student deferment. And I couldn't get one and 
didn't understand why. My draft board would not

33:04.731 --> 33:06.593
tell me why. And it was, you know, it was kind of hard 
to understand

33:08.616 --> 33:21.791
how I managed to achieve the exalted status of 
being singled out for special treatment. But

33:21.811 --> 33:22.893
sure, we talked about it. The guys with student 
affirmants didn't worry about the war. Because as

33:27.447 --> 33:38.261
long as student deferments were generally 
available, and particularly as long as you as an

33:27.447 --> 33:38.261
individual had one, you didn't have to worry too 
much about the war. So they were just relatively

33:38.281 --> 33:41.786
unconcerned? Oh, I wouldn't say unconcerned. 
They weren't as concerned as those people who did

33:44.930 --> 33:49.155
not have student deferments. There weren't many 
of us out there at New Mexico State University.

33:53.541 --> 33:54.923
Certainly there were some others. Do you remember 
if they were planning on going into

33:57.316 --> 34:08.309
the fields that you would construe as being part of 
the war effort? Oh, no. Not that I was aware of. I

34:14.776 --> 34:25.669
just keep getting the classic picture of the Dow 
recruiters and people throwing eggs and oranges

34:14.776 --> 34:25.669
at them, and I was wondering, did anything like 
that happen at New Mexico State? No, not that I know

34:26.915 --> 34:28.998
of. And that's a part of, you know, I was a freshman 
in the Mexico State. There wasn't anybody

34:33.564 --> 34:39.532
recruiting that I ran with. But I can't remember. I 
know there were some people who were kind of

34:40.834 --> 34:50.948
working towards aeronautics and aerospace types 
of degrees.

34:54.016 --> 35:05.488
but I don't really remember anybody being sought 
after for the war effort, although I'm reasonably

34:54.016 --> 35:05.488
certain back in those days they were bound to have 
had their recruiting effort. I just can't

35:05.508 --> 35:11.955
remember who the main recruiters were at New 
Mexico State because I never went through that

35:05.508 --> 35:11.955
process.

35:15.259 --> 35:16.200
Back to Lamar. So you finished, you enrolled in 
Lamar in the spring of 1968. Yeah, spring

35:20.264 --> 35:23.027
semester, right. And it was fairly quiet for you, 
getting back with your studies? Yeah, it was. I

35:31.056 --> 35:42.188
can't remember really where the demonstrations 
and stuff started out at Lamar, but I know most of

35:31.056 --> 35:42.188
those were racially oriented, which I always 
thought was kind of amusing anyway. Given my

35:44.130 --> 35:52.339
attitude toward racial issues and real lack of 
understanding of the Deep South, this was the

35:44.130 --> 35:52.339
first time in my life I'd lived this close to It was 
the only time in my life I can ever remember living

35:53.129 --> 36:01.980
in an area where people thought it was really 
important that blacks and whites not swim in the

35:53.129 --> 36:01.980
same pool. That was a new one on me. That attitude 
about segregation, I had never run across that

36:06.205 --> 36:10.511
before. That was just amazing. Which is not to say 
that attitude wasn't in some other places. I just

36:16.218 --> 36:17.059
wasn't aware of it. But I thought a lot of folks like 
that were strong. So the biggest concern down here

36:20.348 --> 36:24.553
was racial issues? Seemed to be. See, we don't go 
too much longer before I get lost in the war effort.

36:32.604 --> 36:34.626
I can't remember when the lottery came out. The 
military never called me back for a follow-up

36:35.588 --> 36:38.491
physical. And at some point in time, I just can't 
remember. It seems like maybe it was 69 or maybe 70

36:40.734 --> 36:49.866
when they started the lottery system.

36:50.335 --> 37:04.670
The lottery system, of course, the deal on the 
lottery system was nobody was going to have

36:50.335 --> 37:04.670
student deferments anymore, and everybody, you 
know, you were all going to go based on numbers, and

36:50.335 --> 37:04.670
they were going to draft certain age groups and 
this thing. And it was very, very tumultuous

37:04.690 --> 37:16.203
around the dorms during that period of time just 
because of the unknowns of what was going to

37:04.690 --> 37:16.203
happen. And I remember when they had the lottery. I 
didn't actually go watch it on TV. I was doing

37:22.686 --> 37:24.068
something else. But I remember my number was 364 
and my roommate's number was 365. And we spent

37:30.477 --> 37:43.536
weeks having water balloons tossed in our windows 
and being harassed and ridiculed by people with

37:30.477 --> 37:43.536
really exciting numbers like 19. Numbers like 
that. And the people who'd whose lottery numbers

37:48.166 --> 37:56.093
had come out in the under 100 were just, you know, 
they thought life was at an end. And for the rest of

37:56.113 --> 38:00.497
us, the war was over so far as we were. I figured at 
364 they'd take women and children first before

38:00.577 --> 38:05.501
they got around to me. How did that work? Was that 
once a week they'd call up the numbers in order?

38:12.367 --> 38:18.072
What happened was when you registered for the 
draft from then on, you were assigned a number.

38:18.946 --> 38:23.711
everybody in the Selective Service System was 
assigned a number randomly. It's sort of the

38:23.731 --> 38:26.414
famous ping-pong ball system. Here's a date. This 
date gets X number. May 5th got 364.

38:33.021 --> 38:42.692
Then they would draft beginning at number one, and 
they'd call as many numbers as they needed to draft

38:33.021 --> 38:42.692
people for whatever time slot they thought was 
important. And I don't know if the military or

38:43.499 --> 38:48.308
selective service was doing it on a weekly or a 
monthly basis. But it was anticipated that they,

38:49.149 --> 38:54.018
in any given year, would go through 100 or 150. Of 
course, then for the next year, you'd have a whole

38:54.038 --> 39:03.454
new crop of 18, 19-year-olds registering for the 
draft who'd get their numbers. And the idea was

39:03.495 --> 39:07.161
ultimately just to draft them. 18, 19-year-olds 
for the draft because us older folks were so

39:07.394 --> 39:11.841
difficult to manage. So by the time you turned 20, 
you were relatively in the clear. Well, no,

39:17.430 --> 39:22.117
because when I turned 20, that system wasn't in 
place yet. I was in the anything-go system and hung

39:23.158 --> 39:27.886
out there and couldn't get a student deferment. 
The only thing saving my skin was a 1Y, and nobody

39:27.906 --> 39:35.157
called me to go back to the doctor to be examined 
again. But the good thing about the lottery, once

39:36.605 --> 39:41.934
you got your number you had to serve one year of 
eligibility. I served a year of eligibility with

39:42.915 --> 39:49.506
the number 364 knowing that there's no way in the 
world they're going to draft me. And then after

39:50.788 --> 39:56.858
that I was reclassified 4F by the Selective 
Service who apparently decided that Above all

39:57.614 --> 40:02.640
else, it was important that they get the final word 
in on Tom Rugg. And since I had been classified 1Y,

40:03.161 --> 40:15.677
so far as they were concerned, and had served one 
year of eligibility, never understood that, how

40:03.161 --> 40:15.677
you could not be eligible and ineligible at the 
same time. But it was just all a part of what I call

40:15.697 --> 40:19.302
military logic. The terms don't really mesh well 
together. But they did that, classified me 4F. I

40:27.157 --> 40:27.958
appealed that. Why? I didn't want to be 4F. At that 
point in time, the only people classifying 4Fs

40:31.364 --> 40:36.634
were homosexuals and other undesirables. And it 
potentially affected your employability. Every

40:41.482 --> 40:46.251
employer used to go, when you went for an interview 
for a job, One of the things every employer wanted

40:46.973 --> 40:52.580
to know about a male applicant is your draft status 
and your draft number. And 4Fs were not getting

40:52.640 --> 40:55.724
treated well out in the workplace. So I didn't want 
to be a 4F. Of course, nowadays, that doesn't mean

40:57.586 --> 41:02.051
anything. Nobody cares about your draft status 
anymore and didn't by the time I was ready to enter

41:02.111 --> 41:07.318
the workforce. That's because I became a near 
professional student before I was on there. But I

41:12.320 --> 41:20.292
fought that and lost that battle, too, and my final 
standing with the Selective Service System from

41:12.320 --> 41:20.292
those years is a 4F. Until you ran out of eligible 
years. Well, it's just 4F. I mean, I assume

41:26.060 --> 41:35.634
somewhere there is a file with my name on it in the 
Selective Service System somewhere that

41:26.060 --> 41:35.634
documents all this delightful history. And who 
knows? I guess if I really went and looked, I might

41:36.916 --> 41:41.803
even be able to find a reason why I was unable to get a 
student deferment I entered college. I don't care

41:43.965 --> 41:44.966
anymore. It's all over. Let me jump back. Spring of 
1968. Sure. Ted. Do you remember watching Ted on

41:53.595 --> 41:55.116
the news? I'm sure I did, but I don't remember it 
now. You know, there's a lot about Vietnam, but I'm

41:59.381 --> 42:11.554
sure I knew what was going on and was aware of when it 
was happening. But it is not a painful, I mean, it is

42:12.327 --> 42:27.406
a painful memory now, that whole thing and what 
this country went through and the number of guys my

42:12.327 --> 42:27.406
age who never got to be my age because of some 
asinine foreign policy this country pursued. And

42:28.808 --> 42:36.778
there's a lot of that stuff I just, I don't remember 
anymore that I'm sure I was quite well aware of

42:28.808 --> 42:36.778
then. So you really don't remember watching 
what's on the news and thinking, my God, What's

42:42.297 --> 42:44.199
going on? Oh, you know, like I say, I don't remember 
it now. I'm sure I was aware of it then. I mean, I know

42:49.944 --> 42:57.791
that from my perspective, I never saw anything 
about the Vietnam War that commended it to this

42:49.944 --> 42:57.791
country's actions. This country was wrong, had no 
business being in Vietnam, should not have been

42:58.892 --> 43:10.802
there and donated a tremendous number of lives 
over which this country had control and

42:58.892 --> 43:10.802
resources. not to something that was doomed to 
failure from the start. If you don't mind, I'm

43:15.874 --> 43:17.822
going to switch sides of the tape. End of side one.
