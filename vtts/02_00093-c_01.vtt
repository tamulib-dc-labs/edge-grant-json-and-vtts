WEBVTT

00:03.743 --> 00:09.248
that A&M is probably going to see me a lot more than they saw you.

00:09.818 --> 00:12.583
because they're going to have to call me out of here with feet first."

00:13.064 --> 00:17.572
He said, what I cannot afford to give up is my laboratory.

00:17.812 --> 00:21.198
He said, I've got 15 students that I could assign different tasks to.

00:21.218 --> 00:26.227
I don't know which one's going to come out to what I would like to see happen or believe will happen.

00:26.828 --> 00:34.442
Well, one out of the 15 or so, and I'm ad-libbing maybe too feely from my standpoint of what he was saying to me earlier.

00:34.422 --> 00:37.927
I need, in a sense, that laboratory.

00:38.087 --> 00:39.509
You don't need a laboratory.

00:39.849 --> 00:42.172
You could take your lab in your mind and go elsewhere.

00:42.913 --> 00:44.516
But he, and he's right.

00:45.337 --> 00:52.206
I wish I had grad students I could give jobs to, as I did with Lynn Gillette.

00:52.226 --> 00:54.189
Now here, Lynn, you do such and such.

00:54.709 --> 00:59.536
Hiroshi, you work on this idea and we're going to follow that up with an article now.

00:59.936 --> 01:01.138
It'd be wonderful.

01:01.473 --> 01:15.985
But technically we in the, shall I say, the general area of social sciences, we're not bound to the lab as they are and therefore we are I guess more footloose and fancy free and I'm wondering if that was good too.

01:16.426 --> 01:17.428
I sure miss A&M.

01:18.471 --> 01:19.954
Other than the

01:21.284 --> 01:35.624
positive support of Mr. Rutter and other administrators, the improvements in the Department of Economics, the funding that made that possible came from what other sources other than the university?

01:36.025 --> 01:42.454
Well, we got a lot of help from Olin Foundation, National Science Foundation.

01:42.474 --> 01:45.638
We got over a million dollars, I know, in just one fell swoop.

01:45.618 --> 01:48.101
If, again, my memory is correct on that.

01:48.702 --> 01:56.413
And we had several other grants, individuals, almost every one of our published parish professors were picking up grant after grant.

01:56.934 --> 02:03.243
Department of Labor, I know, funded a couple of our studies of individual professors.

02:05.666 --> 02:14.258
So many, many foundations, in other words, sort of the counterpart to the Welsh Foundation that's helped chemistry so much at our university.

02:15.605 --> 02:26.301
Also then alumni put up, I had an alumni professorship for several, several years, and then George and Gladys Bell set up a chair.

02:27.583 --> 02:32.531
And so private monies from graduates of A&M were most helpful.

02:34.614 --> 02:44.008
Unfortunately, government monies were most important, and I say unfortunately because I've got

02:44.630 --> 02:51.099
wish we had only private monies going all over the place than having government too prominent in our lives.

02:52.381 --> 03:02.516
Which staff members, non-faculty, which staff members in the department during those years would you most want to thank if they could all be here today?

03:04.018 --> 03:05.761
What would I like to do with them?

03:06.041 --> 03:14.333
Which staff members do you remember that, with gratitude, there must have been some office people that,

03:15.612 --> 03:19.922
You don't mean necessarily economics?

03:19.942 --> 03:21.646
You mean just people on the campus?

03:21.666 --> 03:28.361
No, I mean in economics, weren't there some secretaries, some staff members that were very helpful?

03:29.163 --> 03:30.566
Almost all of them, really.

03:30.886 --> 03:32.490
I think we had

03:32.470 --> 03:38.839
We've got a great university that attracts pretty good people, shall I say it that way.

03:40.921 --> 03:46.269
Tom saving kids the daylights out of me, saying that I was hell on secretaries.

03:46.850 --> 03:50.595
And I was because I just tried to do too many things.

03:50.615 --> 03:52.277
And he thinks I was too rough on them.

03:52.337 --> 03:56.383
I think many of the secretaries that I had in the past would say I wasn't too bad.

03:56.443 --> 03:58.225
I was almost sweet at times.

03:58.930 --> 04:01.615
I think I had a wonderful crew of secretaries.

04:01.715 --> 04:12.674
Right now I've got Murray, for example, wants to visit three of the ladies in our department, even though we've been out of here for seven years and only back typically for football games.

04:13.536 --> 04:20.989
But there are three ladies right now in our department, plus others who I haven't had much contact with over the years, who have been great.

04:21.374 --> 04:29.224
I can make a phone call on next Tuesday, for example, and ask for Jan, who helps me a great deal on this science and God.

04:30.686 --> 04:36.213
Jan may not be there, so I'll ask, well, let me talk to Trish, and Trish will accommodate me if she's there.

04:36.774 --> 04:38.276
And if not, Carolyn, Carolyn.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.138
They're all very cooperative.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.362
This is one thing I do want to mention.

04:43.502 --> 04:45.525
I think our department is great.

04:45.505 --> 04:52.875
And not necessarily great because we had an exciting, wonderful start and we did have a fantastic break.

04:53.376 --> 05:04.252
We had a university that was breaking out of the old tradition and ready to go ahead and become a major factor in academia, internationally great.

05:04.973 --> 05:11.041
Academically speaking, our students have always been, in my regard, top quality kids.

05:11.061 --> 05:14.466
Not necessarily the brightest in the world, but top quality kids.

05:14.918 --> 05:30.976
Our university through Earl Butter and that whole background era led us to the point where, in the late period of time, in the last century that's just concluded, our Department of Economics, we've had many, many excellent department heads.

05:31.216 --> 05:34.860
Each one of them has done the job that was needed, kept people happy.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.002
We didn't lose many.

05:37.563 --> 05:39.785
Oh, we've had turnover, of course, anyone would.

05:40.866 --> 05:42.428
Bob Eaklin, for example.

05:43.015 --> 05:44.497
We deliberately lost him.

05:44.577 --> 05:49.402
In fact I told him to go to Auburn because he didn't like mathematics.

05:50.444 --> 05:54.488
And we were a department that was primarily mathematically oriented.

05:55.369 --> 06:00.515
And Bob did not want to do mathematics and he felt sort of out of place.

06:01.016 --> 06:04.720
And yet what he could do was so outstanding.

06:04.801 --> 06:10.147
But he's again got a major position at Auburn, a tremendous chair.

06:10.287 --> 06:13.210
I don't know his salary but his involvement.

06:14.251 --> 06:19.997
He left here because, among other things, I know I was one to suggest, Bob, I love you.

06:20.558 --> 06:21.318
Go to Auburn.

06:21.338 --> 06:26.604
You'll be happier there than here because your field's a specialization.

06:26.624 --> 06:30.488
You don't have enough comradeship here that you

06:30.468 --> 06:31.429
personally deserve.

06:32.130 --> 06:45.309
So anyway, we do have some sort of a cluster of academia in economics at A&M, which is a little different than completely across the board, but no university.

06:45.590 --> 06:50.637
Chicago is much more confined, U of Chicago, no matter how great they think it is.

06:51.157 --> 06:55.143
Harvard is also more confined from my standpoint than we are.

06:55.163 --> 07:05.878
I think we're more across the board, but we're still essentially mathematically rooted in our economics department, probably because of Lloyd Heaton's impact.

07:06.539 --> 07:17.755
It was a bloody necessity that we move in that direction as if we were going to develop the way I think Earl Rudder and others wanted us to.

07:18.629 --> 07:24.377
Our supporting staff, the ladies who work here, everyone, I've never heard any problems from anyone.

07:25.558 --> 07:28.262
The men get along real well with each other.

07:29.464 --> 07:37.975
We're now editing a journal, Economic Inquiry, which is one of the top journals in economics throughout the world.

07:38.336 --> 07:39.657
When did that begin here?

07:40.078 --> 07:42.681
Oh, I wish the heck I could say it happened back in the 60s.

07:42.802 --> 07:43.442
No way.

07:44.023 --> 07:46.847
It happened just about four or five years ago.

07:47.080 --> 07:54.736
And I think the fellas in that department there, they were being honored by the fact that they were able to get this journal moved.

07:54.796 --> 07:58.764
I believe it had been housed out of UCLA, and they moved it.

07:58.824 --> 08:00.888
And UCLA is not a bad institution.

08:01.931 --> 08:04.897
They moved it out of there to A&M's Department of Economics.

08:05.358 --> 08:08.464
I think it was about 1994, 1995.

08:09.271 --> 08:12.877
And that attests to the quality of the men there now.

08:13.518 --> 08:15.401
Unfortunately, I had retired by 92.

08:15.461 --> 08:18.505
Maybe that gave them that extra lift, getting rid of me.

08:19.627 --> 08:25.436
But seriously, it's a fantastic journal and it has international recognition.

08:26.137 --> 08:32.427
And for A&M's Department of Econ to be a home base, that attests to our current department head.

08:33.233 --> 08:41.668
Dennis Jansen, our private department head, Tim Gronberg and Tom Saving, who held that job for quite a while, and John Maloney.

08:42.209 --> 08:46.437
We've had a great group of guys.

08:47.038 --> 08:55.393
During the years that you, after you left the department headship and were a faculty member, what courses did you enjoy teaching most?

08:57.348 --> 08:59.711
Spatial Microeconomics.

08:59.731 --> 09:00.933
I don't know what we called it.

09:02.896 --> 09:10.326
I think we did draw that title into it and I did enjoy teaching my own basic subject.

09:10.346 --> 09:16.915
I used to love teaching macroeconomics too and I've written books you mentioned earlier on other pinnacle points.

09:17.456 --> 09:27.270
I did write a couple of books in the field of macroeconomics which is quite distinct from Spatial Micro and that dealt with my interest in depressions.

09:27.807 --> 09:35.377
And at that time I would say I'm a Keynesian economist, but not a classical Keynesian.

09:36.077 --> 09:42.045
I'm a demand side Keynesian economist who's throwing in supply side economics.

09:43.447 --> 09:50.756
Another way of putting it, people have, in my opinion, a long impression of Keynesian economics.

09:51.617 --> 09:55.502
They think it's really big government, liberalism and so forth.

09:55.651 --> 10:11.917
I see in it reasons for tax cutting out of Reagan and Bush and so forth, and it has supply-side phenomena on top of it, which is not classical Keynes, but to me, my variant of that subject.

10:11.937 --> 10:16.243
So I did do work over the years in macroeconomic theory.

10:16.764 --> 10:21.692
I enjoy teaching macroeconomics more than micro when I taught undergraduates.

10:23.107 --> 10:36.264
And I think undergraduates can be taught macro much more readily than micro, because with macro you immediately can say such things as, do you realize we had as many unemployed in the Depression years in this country as we had in the U.S.

10:36.644 --> 10:48.079
Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Air Force, which was, of course the Air Force was either the Army or the Navy Air Force in World War II, but we had as many unemployed as we had throughout World War II in the military?

10:48.099 --> 10:51.443
That many people unemployed?

10:53.532 --> 10:58.839
And so anyway, I haven't long had that concern.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.063
And right now I'm a little concerned about the Fed.

11:02.103 --> 11:03.565
I'm wondering what's going to happen tomorrow.

11:06.148 --> 11:21.548
During those, well, during all your A&M years, what were your proudest moments, specific moments that you're really proud to think, to recall in your mind?

11:25.544 --> 11:26.445
It's going to amaze you.

11:28.348 --> 11:35.818
One of the ones that popped into my mind was when we were playing Alabama in the Cotton Bowl.

11:37.420 --> 11:42.366
Oh gosh, that's going to trigger another one I hope, trying to remind me about my mind.

11:45.170 --> 11:53.982
We're up at a hotel, I forget which one, up in Dallas, and we're having a big party, Earl Rudd is up on the roster.

11:55.970 --> 12:04.364
He's talking about the game tomorrow and A&M and what we're doing at the university and how we're developing and so forth.

12:04.384 --> 12:09.733
And if Earl were a politician I'd say it was really not a political speech.

12:10.674 --> 12:17.085
It was just a gentle welcome and isn't it great for us all to be here and so forth.

12:17.906 --> 12:20.070
And we had some jerks in the back of the

12:23.965 --> 12:33.878
auditorium, whatever I should use to describe the big place that we were in, yelling, roll tide, roll.

12:34.939 --> 12:36.081
And I mean, they were obnoxious.

12:36.161 --> 12:41.027
They would cut in on the middle of Earl's statements.

12:41.047 --> 12:44.632
And I kept thinking, boy, somehow he's going to really take offense and slug those fellas.

12:45.433 --> 12:53.483
I almost fell angry as could be, and I'm sitting up there sort of in the front, and angry as could be,

12:53.682 --> 12:54.986
What's wrong with those idiots?

12:55.026 --> 13:02.551
Can't they understand that they wouldn't like it if they were having an old tie party and we'd come in there yelling gig'em, gig'em or something like that?

13:03.293 --> 13:05.059
Anyway, he kept his composure.

13:06.338 --> 13:18.353
No way did he demonstrate that that man had the fortitude to go up Pointe Hoke and look at machine guns and rifles especially, bearing down right at him and they're kicking ladders over.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.116
What fortitude.

13:20.536 --> 13:33.493
To me, one of my proudest moments of A&M was the fact that that man kept his composure right before the day before a football game, the evening before, and did not even say anything to those old Todd Rose

13:34.081 --> 13:37.084
People ignored them and kept talking as if they didn't exist.

13:37.764 --> 13:39.626
I thought A&M is pretty doggone great.

13:40.527 --> 14:03.008
A second point, shortly before that, maybe just about a month before that, Maury and I are sitting at this football game and we had those special seats for a few years while I was active at the University as a department head and my brother's family.

14:03.072 --> 14:07.680
And by gosh, we're playing Texas and we've got a chance to beat them.

14:07.820 --> 14:12.950
And back in those days, as you know us better than I do, we didn't beat Texas too often.

14:13.931 --> 14:25.452
And this fellow behind us, gee an old man, now he's my, I mean what I'm thinking of now, he was probably my current age, and I would say he was a real old guy.

14:25.904 --> 14:28.867
And he's back of us yelling up a storm.

14:29.088 --> 14:31.891
My gosh, he had good vocal chords.

14:31.911 --> 14:36.316
And my wife and I are thinking, Lord, I wish he'd be quiet a little bit.

14:36.336 --> 14:37.677
That man is going berserk.

14:38.879 --> 14:48.550
And lo and behold, this is the year that I think the Longhorns had the Coy, one of the Coy's playing football, and Streep maybe was their quarterback.

14:49.371 --> 14:51.873
I don't recall the exact group.

14:51.954 --> 14:53.235
I remember more of the Aggies.

14:54.196 --> 14:55.017
But we beat them.

14:56.380 --> 14:59.203
And Mari and I thought, boy, this is unbelievable.

14:59.284 --> 15:00.685
We beat the U of Texas.

15:01.667 --> 15:05.511
And Mari turns around to look at this fellow to say, we won.

15:07.193 --> 15:09.757
And she looks at him and I didn't bother turning around.

15:09.797 --> 15:18.027
I'm looking at all the kids across the stands away from us and all the faculty and other older folks around near us.

15:18.407 --> 15:19.128
I didn't turn around.

15:19.849 --> 15:23.133
She turned around and she said, he is crying like a baby.

15:24.595 --> 15:26.337
The guy was crying.

15:26.485 --> 15:30.536
I turned around a few minutes later myself and I said, well, we sure did win.

15:31.077 --> 15:32.120
He's still crying.

15:33.524 --> 15:38.016
He was so happy that his university beat the Longhorns.

15:38.738 --> 15:42.267
I thought, my gosh, this place is pretty fabulous.

15:44.288 --> 15:52.587
Another football event, one of the earlier ones before that good year, I guess back in 1966 we had a really bad team.

15:53.650 --> 16:00.947
I even went with Gene Stallings and the team to watch them play Florida State and lost in Tallahassee.

16:00.927 --> 16:20.213
But anyway, one of the first games Murray and I watched at A&M in football, at the end of the game we lost badly and Murray and I were used to universities where you lose, you sulk and you grumble and walk out and moaning to yourself and said, my gosh, the A&M student body is cheering.

16:21.515 --> 16:26.882
And Murray and I looked at each other, boy this is a pretty doggone good university.

16:26.902 --> 16:30.006
They could lose badly and still be proud.

16:30.374 --> 16:39.333
And those were frankly very, very proud moments indirectly or very unique moments in my life even though it had nothing to do with me.

16:40.295 --> 16:43.643
What about amusing moments that you recall?

16:44.184 --> 16:46.649
Amusing moments?

16:48.313 --> 16:48.433
Goofy.

16:48.413 --> 16:52.678
Did any student ever try to play a trick on you as a faculty member?

16:52.939 --> 16:55.261
No, I guess I was not the funny type.

16:55.281 --> 16:58.746
Well, you also weren't teaching those big introductory courses.

16:58.806 --> 17:01.329
That's where some... Yeah, that's where you would tend to get it.

17:01.349 --> 17:03.532
No, I can't think of it.

17:03.572 --> 17:08.818
Where something just... It happened that it wasn't supposed to happen?

17:09.559 --> 17:11.181
Some goof or something like that?

17:12.427 --> 17:15.790
No, I really can't recall anything of that guy.

17:15.810 --> 17:24.800
Then on a serious one, did anybody ever try to use any inappropriate influence on you?

17:25.220 --> 17:28.383
Did anybody try to maneuver somebody's grade?

17:28.663 --> 17:30.565
No, but can I tell you the truth on this one?

17:33.048 --> 17:35.771
I didn't influence myself improperly.

17:36.892 --> 17:38.093
I liked Gene Stallings.

17:38.493 --> 17:39.394
I liked A&M.

17:39.535 --> 17:41.016
I liked A&M's football.

17:41.924 --> 17:45.673
And I recognize that these football players have a pretty tough time.

17:46.696 --> 17:53.453
And I'm setting up a published parish department, and I'm getting young people like Phil Graham, Chuck Maurice,

17:54.142 --> 18:06.839
Bob Eaklin, all new PhDs, suddenly replacing fellows who weren't, and they're going to go ahead because I'm trying to tell them we're going to be a top quality department.

18:06.859 --> 18:12.567
And I figure these boys are going to be awful rough and the heck with a football player, they'll flunk the daylights out of these fellows.

18:14.570 --> 18:20.858
I forget the man who Gene had to coordinate the academic lives of his football players.

18:22.458 --> 18:25.200
I could roughly take a guess, but I don't even think I should.

18:25.421 --> 18:27.543
Was it a fellow named Gibson by any chance?

18:27.583 --> 18:37.532
But anyway, I knew the man back then who was supposed to advise his football players on their academic programs.

18:38.813 --> 18:52.465
And I had this one fellow who stayed with us at A&M who was not on the list to be helped obtain a better job elsewhere.

18:53.390 --> 18:58.215
whose name I can't remember again, and he did do a lot of running.

18:58.255 --> 19:07.043
I'll sometime call you on, or when you come to Rockwell, tell you his name, especially, Murray mentioned him to me about a month ago.

19:08.404 --> 19:22.097
Anyway, I told, in effect, Gene, if you've got any youngsters who have economics as their requirement, and if the boy is not one of the really good white kids, but just an average

19:24.912 --> 19:27.518
type of football player in terms of scholarship.

19:28.480 --> 19:36.398
Have him take this man's course, because this man will work harder with football players than anyone else I've got.

19:37.621 --> 19:40.407
So from that standpoint, I cheated.

19:40.910 --> 19:44.177
Everybody else could take the same course though.

19:44.477 --> 19:46.020
Oh yes, yes.

19:46.040 --> 19:57.744
But I made sure that the football players and other athletes who didn't, who were in many ways taken advantage of more so back then than now, now they're getting too many side gratuities.

19:57.804 --> 20:00.690
But back then I did identify with those kids.

20:01.126 --> 20:12.283
And I did tell Gene through his coordinator, this man is the only one I recommend unless your boy wants to become a professional economist or something.

20:12.837 --> 20:19.665
But no regent tried to get somebody an assistantship or a grade?

20:19.785 --> 20:23.910
Never had that, but I've had people ask me to help get so-and-so into the school.

20:24.711 --> 20:27.033
I've had a bunch of people in buying a loan.

20:28.435 --> 20:34.542
I'm sure all of us have had that, but no, I've never had any undue influence.

20:35.298 --> 20:36.940
from any person of that kind.

20:37.781 --> 20:38.262
Been lucky.

20:38.622 --> 20:40.505
What do you look at the big picture?

20:41.226 --> 20:44.450
What are Texas A&M's strengths, as far as you can tell?

20:46.392 --> 20:46.573
Students.

20:46.593 --> 20:48.295
Students and some of we old faculty.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.078
What about those students?

20:51.799 --> 20:54.603
I think they're basically clean cut kids.

20:54.983 --> 21:03.955
I sort of like the idea that I think the university has rejected of a boy saying, what I like about A&M is that boys like girls and girls like boys.

21:03.935 --> 21:07.259
I'm on your side on that one.

21:07.439 --> 21:09.721
And to me, that's A&M.

21:09.741 --> 21:26.500
And therefore I've got, frankly I've got, counting my son, we've got about eight degrees out of A&M now, and one family along the Chase family, that's my daughter Peggy's husband Ron, they've got four

21:26.480 --> 21:29.986
You've got a fair investment.

21:30.367 --> 21:31.609
Oh yes, yes.

21:31.629 --> 21:34.473
So I am invested in A&M in many, many ways.

21:34.493 --> 21:44.290
If you were now the advisor to the Texas A&M leadership, what advice would you give them?

21:44.651 --> 21:50.260
Try to go back to what we were like more in the 70s and 80s than when we became two

21:50.628 --> 22:03.507
And I mean too average now, not in the sense that we're not a better university today from the standpoint of academia in terms of academic excellence and potential Nobel laureates and so forth.

22:03.892 --> 22:06.416
But I think we are too politically correct now.

22:06.596 --> 22:18.092
We're conforming too much to some of the minority groups, and I'm not in any way trying to suggest that I'm anti this minority or that minority, quite the opposite.

22:18.192 --> 22:21.917
I can understand and identify and sympathize with them.

22:21.897 --> 22:26.262
But I don't have to take a course in black hair to know what a black has gone through in this country.

22:26.843 --> 22:33.551
And I don't have to apologize for people that I've never known who centuries ago may have done some bad things.

22:34.251 --> 22:41.019
And I'm not going to go ahead and personally accept the idea that Robert E. Lee was a horrible human being.

22:41.640 --> 22:47.567
I have in fact, the little I know about the man's background, he was a rather decent military man.

22:47.547 --> 22:50.312
Well, a superb husband, father, churchman.

22:50.813 --> 22:52.716
He freed all of his own slaves.

22:54.860 --> 22:58.086
He did what everybody should have done.

22:58.106 --> 23:05.639
So the old A&M would eulogize exactly what you just said.

23:06.280 --> 23:08.644
And they would say, I wish I were like him.

23:09.451 --> 23:14.163
Let's see, I skipped over, and I'm looking back at when I skipped over.

23:15.186 --> 23:19.096
When Mr. Rudder died, he's replaced by Jack Williams and John Calhoun.

23:20.058 --> 23:23.106
How did you see them and their leadership?

23:23.677 --> 23:24.719
I thought they did great.

23:25.040 --> 23:25.722
They really did.

23:27.687 --> 23:31.556
Just like I would say I did a fantastic job in economics.

23:31.736 --> 23:37.771
I had fantastic backing, as I've indicated, including bankers who I never even knew until after I got here.

23:38.532 --> 23:42.141
So someone greased a lot of the tracks.

23:42.121 --> 23:45.827
But after me, we had a series of guys who kept doing it.

23:46.348 --> 23:49.352
They were all in the same ballpark, all in the same spirit.

23:49.573 --> 23:50.875
I think the same thing was true.

23:51.956 --> 23:56.223
I'm not saying that Jack Williams was, no one could be, in my regard, another Earl Rudder.

23:57.164 --> 24:01.331
Frankly, Earl Rudder would be the most amazing university president, especially today.

24:01.791 --> 24:04.095
No one would think he would be

24:04.075 --> 24:06.961
He was not an academician as such.

24:06.981 --> 24:17.705
He was a soldier, and thank heaven Eisenhower indicated that great soldiers are not necessarily great university presidents, as much as I did admire Eisenhower.

24:17.725 --> 24:20.852
What he did at Columbia was not phenomenal.

24:20.832 --> 24:27.486
But those who followed Earl Butter, just like those who followed in economics, I think have all done the job.

24:27.967 --> 24:33.559
We've also had some rather good deans, too, that I know of, and the dean of faculty.

24:34.161 --> 24:38.149
Everything went smoothly, as far as I can tell, after Wayne.

24:38.737 --> 24:43.964
Wayne Hall and Mac Prescott was, all of you guys frankly.

24:44.585 --> 24:57.502
I think everyone here who's still, anyway, everyone in the 70s and 80s did beautiful jobs in the 90s and now I'm getting a little concerned.

24:58.524 --> 25:06.094
I'm afraid we're being pressurized too much to mimic Stanford, Berkeley, Yale,

25:06.580 --> 25:10.024
And I'm getting a little upset over that.

25:10.144 --> 25:20.255
I don't like what our current dean and our college, frankly, your college, mine, or olden days, have been doing with multicultural diversity requirements.

25:20.456 --> 25:21.677
To me, I don't buy it.

25:21.797 --> 25:35.052
I'm still back in Plato, Aristotle, and I think of the greatness of our scholars who have been learned in those areas and what they've been able to create over the centuries.

25:35.622 --> 25:39.345
Don't take race out of the course and make it a separate.

25:40.386 --> 25:41.568
Put it into the course.

25:41.788 --> 25:42.088
Yes.

25:42.749 --> 25:46.212
I kid around with Dennis Jansen.

25:46.232 --> 25:47.073
Have you met Dennis?

25:47.553 --> 25:48.034
No.

25:48.054 --> 25:48.774
You've got to.

25:49.455 --> 25:53.739
And in fact, sometimes, you know, Dennis knows I'm here visiting with you.

25:54.560 --> 26:03.688
And I told Dennis, I asked Dennis if he would ever be receptive, if you would like to meet with he and a handful of those who he thinks have been most part

26:03.989 --> 26:08.021
the biggest part of our Department of Economics over the years.

26:08.301 --> 26:09.204
Oh, I'd be honored.

26:09.485 --> 26:10.949
Oh, I think it'd be wonderful.

26:10.969 --> 26:11.671
Yes, yes.

26:11.992 --> 26:17.809
Anyway, with Dennis on this subject, Dennis, bless him, has a flock of Bach here.

26:17.929 --> 26:19.213
It's beautiful.

26:19.193 --> 26:27.802
I've been so envious of him, and now I'm talking about ten years ago when he was in our department and I wasn't quite as bald as I am.

26:27.822 --> 26:38.954
I would look at Dennis and I'd say, you know something, I'm going to teach a course here on baldness because you have no idea what it's like and you could not figure it out.

26:38.974 --> 26:44.239
He said, well Mel, I'll teach a course in black hair and you wouldn't understand it because you don't have any.

26:45.670 --> 26:49.936
Isn't that amazing we have to have courses like that?

26:51.538 --> 26:57.165
Like I don't want a course in women's history any more than there'll be a course in men's history.

26:57.265 --> 26:58.126
Yes, I agree.

26:58.146 --> 26:59.789
It's a course in American history.

27:00.029 --> 27:02.612
Yes, oh gosh, it's pathetic.

27:03.333 --> 27:11.184
Let's see, getting close to finished, did we finish with advice to A&M?

27:12.345 --> 27:13.787
What advice would you give

27:14.678 --> 27:15.759
A&M's leadership.

27:16.540 --> 27:21.346
Go back to how we would have answered the problems that are current today.

27:21.386 --> 27:27.014
How would they have answered it back in 1975, 1985, even 1990?

27:27.114 --> 27:35.825
Let us not necessarily mimic what the press wants us to be saying.

27:36.546 --> 27:37.687
Let's be A&M.

27:37.827 --> 27:38.949
All right.

27:38.969 --> 27:44.095
What advice would you have to the economics program today?

27:46.555 --> 27:47.977
They call you as a consultant.

27:49.259 --> 27:50.581
Forget Hollywood.

27:50.901 --> 27:53.405
Forget the language that you're picking up out of Hollywood.

27:53.986 --> 28:02.678
Treat your students as if they were your parents, but make them learn and be proud of your teaching besides your research.

28:03.359 --> 28:11.972
And by gosh, it's kind of tough to say teaching because we know the unfortunate part of the game is research.

28:12.222 --> 28:14.764
And in fact here, what should A&M do about it?

28:15.285 --> 28:18.568
I think A&M should start, and I do want to mention Al Chalk in this connection.

28:19.549 --> 28:36.063
A&M should start honoring the guys who really can teach, and they should learn how to identify not by student questionnaires, but you can identify by the fellows who have graduated, try to learn from the graduates who they really thought were great as professors.

28:37.144 --> 28:41.368
These questionnaires I don't think will do the job, but Al Chalk,

28:41.804 --> 28:55.258
were so, in effect, maligned, both by way of his paycheck and his job, because Earl had the idea, or anyone who likes Willie Nelson and brings a Willie Nelson to our campus cannot be my type of man.

28:56.099 --> 28:57.340
Earl, in fact, he misjudged him.

28:58.001 --> 29:11.355
It took me about two and a half years to convince Earl Rudder that Al Chalk is much more your type of man than you've ever imagined, maybe more so your type than I am, and Al deserves a teaching award.

29:13.242 --> 29:21.069
And Earl, I guess told Andy Suttle or whoever was the one in charge of that end of it, okay, let's give Al Chalk a teaching award.

29:21.569 --> 29:23.551
Al Chalk was a phenomenal teacher.

29:23.571 --> 29:24.372
Oh yes, yes.

29:24.592 --> 29:26.534
But he never was paid for it.

29:26.694 --> 29:28.635
He never was recognized for it.

29:28.655 --> 29:30.817
And that I think is a glaring error that we've got.

29:31.678 --> 29:43.148
Maybe we want to encourage, in spite of the fact that we've got to keep going on the research level, but maybe we want to figure out some way to really encourage young people

29:43.465 --> 29:53.982
to keep their heart in the classroom, do the job right, and that they will at worst be taken care of pretty well, even if other universities are not bidding for their services.

29:55.987 --> 29:58.492
All right, two more questions.

29:59.874 --> 30:07.850
Let's make believe that someone walks up to you and hands you a check for a million dollars with one requirement.

30:08.631 --> 30:15.244
You must pass it on to Texas A&M, but you get to decide what use will be made of it.

30:15.224 --> 30:22.412
What would you have A&M do if you were to give them a large gift?

30:22.432 --> 30:26.557
What would be your favorite A&M recipient?

30:36.729 --> 30:37.730
Gosh, you got me stumped.

30:39.733 --> 30:43.577
I probably immediately called you and a few other friends and asked for advice.

30:44.266 --> 30:45.808
really, and I would do that.

30:45.828 --> 30:50.634
I would ask Al Cotton what's wrong in chemistry that could be rectified.

30:50.674 --> 30:54.018
I'd call Tim Hall what's wrong in biology that could be rectified.

30:54.039 --> 30:57.923
I don't know the current mathematicians as I did years ago.

30:57.944 --> 30:58.845
I would call them.

30:58.865 --> 31:02.389
I would call the areas that I think I have some rapport with.

31:03.511 --> 31:07.095
I would call the people in political science, sociology, and history, and English.

31:07.976 --> 31:09.278
Find out from each one.

31:09.663 --> 31:15.078
what they think is their glaring need, and how could they improve it if they have money.

31:15.920 --> 31:23.301
And then I'd probably take that million and try to apportion it some way to the two or three areas I would play under.
