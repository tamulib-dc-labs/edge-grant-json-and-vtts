00:03.170 --> 00:04.854
25-acre farm is no more.

00:04.994 --> 00:06.277
Not a viable enterprise.

00:06.718 --> 00:08.923
And the number of gins has decreased.

00:08.943 --> 00:09.504
Decreased.

00:10.828 --> 00:15.538
And the labor force has decreased considerably.

00:17.042 --> 00:21.111
Because the crop is so highly mechanized all the way through.

00:22.525 --> 00:28.152
very little hand labor is used in the crop anymore.

00:29.534 --> 00:40.588
Looking back, can you think of any research task you wish you had attempted that you didn't now in hindsight?

00:43.913 --> 00:44.073
No.

00:44.974 --> 00:50.541
Is there any that you proposed that some, that didn't get supported?

00:53.052 --> 00:57.274
Yes, but they would have been variations

00:59.144 --> 01:00.386
in what I was already doing.

01:00.546 --> 01:00.887
Oh, okay.

01:00.907 --> 01:03.411
So, so it was no, no major... No.

01:03.431 --> 01:06.736
I had no major disappointments in my... Right.

01:07.057 --> 01:13.948
As you, as you look back on those more than three decades, to whom do you feel the most grateful?

01:15.270 --> 01:16.953
The, your, of your associates?

01:17.974 --> 01:23.623
The most... Certainly Dr. Tom Richmond would have to be number one.

01:25.547 --> 01:26.468
Morris Bloodworth,

01:27.815 --> 01:29.757
was a big help to me.

01:33.161 --> 01:39.748
Charlie Lewis, Maeda Brown, Fred Elliott, certainly.

01:41.330 --> 01:47.837
He taught me a lot about the practical side of cotton in Texas.

01:48.177 --> 01:48.778
For example?

01:49.639 --> 01:52.742
Where it's grown, who does it, how they do it.

01:53.245 --> 01:59.231
why they don't do something else, and all the intricacies and the oddities.

02:00.952 --> 02:05.517
Little things I remember still in my mind, Fred explaining things to me.

02:06.298 --> 02:08.340
I'd look at, what's that all about?

02:09.721 --> 02:14.886
I can remember one of my very first trips with Fred Elliott, we went to the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

02:16.007 --> 02:21.312
We're driving down Highway 77, the other side of Lincoln,

02:22.912 --> 02:25.214
on Highway 21 before we hit 77.

02:25.514 --> 02:36.044
I remember looking over there and seeing piles of trees and brush and a couple of caterpillars parked out there.

02:36.945 --> 02:39.307
I'd never seen anything like it.

02:39.327 --> 02:44.572
And he introduced me to the practice of cabling to clear land.

02:45.954 --> 02:48.156
Why that sticks in my mind, I do not know.

02:49.677 --> 02:50.758
Or going to a gin.

02:51.447 --> 03:05.008
in Wesley Cole at night and watching them bring the wagons in, counting how long it took them to get a bailout and why it took so long or why they went so quickly with it.

03:05.869 --> 03:07.171
Just little things like that.

03:09.976 --> 03:11.278
We were talking about others.

03:11.538 --> 03:15.244
Had you finished your list of people to whom you feel great gratitude?

03:19.358 --> 03:20.820
Probably Roy Quinby.

03:23.504 --> 03:27.890
He was not a cotton man, but he did the cotton work at Chillicothe.

03:28.892 --> 03:36.302
But he was... That's a very severe environment for growing row crops.

03:38.526 --> 03:44.935
He taught me a little about dry land farming in the Rolling Plains of Texas, for instance.

03:44.955 --> 03:47.138
Paul Lyarly in El Paso,

03:48.012 --> 03:49.955
taught me a good bit about.

03:49.975 --> 04:02.934
How you read cotton for that unique environment in that real lower in that Rio Grande Valley below El Paso.

04:04.436 --> 04:16.433
All those people had quite an influence on on what I felt and what I learned and and gave me things to apply Knox Walker and etymology.

04:17.915 --> 04:18.776
They helped to me.

04:20.377 --> 04:21.158
There's too many of them.

04:21.178 --> 04:21.959
I can't name them all.

04:22.679 --> 04:30.766
Of all the research locations other than College Station, for whatever reason, what were your favorite places?

04:30.826 --> 04:32.047
We're not going to ask the unfavorite.

04:32.067 --> 04:34.429
Which ones did you enjoy going to visit most?

04:37.752 --> 04:38.333
El Paso?

04:40.775 --> 04:42.016
Wesley Cole?

04:42.036 --> 04:43.738
Why those two?

04:44.859 --> 04:46.420
Well, for one thing, they were different.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.531
That was the first thing.

04:49.851 --> 04:51.414
They were very different for me.

04:52.436 --> 04:56.143
So that it wasn't like going into my own material.

04:58.548 --> 04:59.169
Wesley Co.

04:59.390 --> 05:00.973
was different.

05:00.993 --> 05:02.897
I enjoyed working around Corpus Christi.

05:04.440 --> 05:08.307
Later years when Texas A&M acquired the

05:08.725 --> 05:14.171
the old Renner Research Station north of Dallas.

05:14.191 --> 05:15.452
We began to work up there.

05:15.473 --> 05:16.794
They had no cotton.

05:16.814 --> 05:22.540
There hadn't been any cotton work up in that country since they closed out the Greenville Station in the 50s.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.424
And they accommodated us.

05:25.604 --> 05:27.045
I even had an office up there.

05:28.687 --> 05:38.378
Huey Whitehurst, who was the director up there, was an extremely personable, knowledgeable, and helpful man.

05:39.050 --> 05:40.232
I enjoyed working up there.

05:42.355 --> 05:48.445
What we did was not particularly satisfying, because that really is not, was not a good place to do cotton.

05:49.006 --> 05:50.528
But it was nice to work there.

05:50.548 --> 05:53.813
It was fun to work there.

05:54.975 --> 06:01.325
The old station up in McGregor, a man by the name of Henry Hill was the director up there.

06:02.507 --> 06:05.732
And boy, we used to go up there and sweat like the Dickens.

06:06.421 --> 06:17.932
But they made you feel welcome, and you felt as though you were doing something visible that people appreciated knowing about and seeing.

06:19.433 --> 06:21.575
That was the fun part of working with people like that.

06:22.396 --> 06:30.844
Based on your knowledge of the cotton production, where is the easiest place to grow cotton in Texas?

06:32.886 --> 06:34.487
The easiest place?

06:37.015 --> 06:39.438
Cost of land is not a factor.

06:39.458 --> 06:40.920
Okay, now, I wasn't even thinking about that.

06:41.341 --> 06:44.945
The easiest place to grow, Texas, Brazos' bottom's not bad.

06:48.029 --> 06:55.539
The lower Rio Grande Valley, they probably have fewer real bad years than anyone else.

06:56.660 --> 06:59.885
Corpuses can be pretty tough.

07:01.507 --> 07:05.672
Brazos' bottom, year in, year out, is not bad.

07:06.108 --> 07:11.376
The high plains, the weather up there can deal you misery so quickly.

07:11.977 --> 07:15.522
Now, where would the insects be the worst?

07:17.084 --> 07:17.965
Brazos bottom.

07:18.045 --> 07:19.047
Is that it?

07:19.067 --> 07:19.227
Okay.

07:20.449 --> 07:24.735
Brazos bottom, corpus area.

07:24.755 --> 07:31.865
When did, in your experience, when did people start spraying cotton by airplanes?

07:32.506 --> 07:33.768
Was that being done in the 50s?

07:35.551 --> 07:35.811
Yeah.

07:36.938 --> 07:48.895
That went back probably into the late 40s with the beginning of the Delta Airlines right down there in the bottom.

07:50.798 --> 08:00.432
Now, when I first came here, a lot of the insect control was done with mounted sprayers, mechanical sprayers.

08:01.233 --> 08:06.220
But the use of airplanes really came into its own.

08:07.820 --> 08:11.725
And when you got here, cotton was already being harvested by machines.

08:13.427 --> 08:15.310
It was in that transition period.

08:15.330 --> 08:16.331
Oh, okay.

08:16.351 --> 08:18.634
It was in transition period.

08:18.654 --> 08:21.318
Of course, they'd harvested with stripper machines for years.

08:21.398 --> 08:22.259
Yeah.

08:22.279 --> 08:25.343
Up in the Blacklands and particularly in the High Plains.

08:25.823 --> 08:33.253
But the spindle picker was really coming into its own initially in the valley, then up in this area.

08:34.246 --> 08:39.155
Then into the Corpus area.

08:40.177 --> 08:46.308
How easy was it when integration came about, racial integration at Texas A&M?

08:46.748 --> 08:52.539
Do you remember any problems with minorities, black, be they black or other, in the kind of work y'all were doing?

08:52.799 --> 08:52.959
No.

08:54.222 --> 08:54.863
What about women?

08:54.923 --> 08:58.870
Did they have any problems when women were admitted to A&M?

09:01.583 --> 09:03.326
Not that I can recall.

09:04.449 --> 09:10.060
Obviously, there was some resistance to it, but it was not too overt.

09:10.080 --> 09:16.432
Well, our Dottie, Annie, who you know, was one of the early ones, you know.

09:17.073 --> 09:17.915
She went to school.

09:18.556 --> 09:18.937
What year?

09:19.758 --> 09:22.123
Well, let's see, when she graduated,

09:25.310 --> 09:27.616
She must have graduated about 1971.

09:27.697 --> 09:30.223
So she would have been one of them.

09:30.284 --> 09:31.908
She was one of the earlier classes.

09:33.533 --> 09:38.707
I don't think she had any problems.

09:38.727 --> 09:39.910
It was a peaceful place.

09:41.105 --> 10:00.322
Let's see, some unwritten rules or practices which you followed as a professional, when smoking, drinking, this, that, and the other, when you were on the job.

10:00.662 --> 10:01.283
You didn't do it.

10:01.983 --> 10:03.845
Didn't, was it okay to smoke?

10:04.626 --> 10:05.066
Yeah.

10:05.086 --> 10:05.587
In the lab?

10:06.908 --> 10:09.390
Did it, in those years, did that change?

10:10.771 --> 10:13.875
Hmm, probably not by mandate.

10:14.115 --> 10:15.697
No, but I mean in fact.

10:15.717 --> 10:17.499
Oh yeah, in fact it did, certainly.

10:18.941 --> 10:27.030
When you all were on the road, what was the norm about having a beer or any other kind of alcohol?

10:28.492 --> 10:35.800
As long as you used some discretion with it, I can't ever recall running into a problem.

10:35.820 --> 10:40.626
And certainly there was never, I can't recall anybody ever telling me

10:40.910 --> 10:42.532
me or anybody else.

10:43.093 --> 10:44.975
Hey, you shall not do this.

10:45.656 --> 10:56.570
But was it the common practice that nobody would ever, when they were out at one of the experiment stations and spending the night in the motel, that they wouldn't overdrink?

10:56.751 --> 10:57.291
Was that the?

10:57.872 --> 11:00.916
You just, that was just the facts of life.

11:01.016 --> 11:01.837
That's what I assumed.

11:01.998 --> 11:03.820
That's like opening the doors for a lady.

11:04.441 --> 11:09.988
It was part of, it just was part of being there.

11:10.238 --> 11:11.441
You didn't do it any other way.

11:11.942 --> 11:14.267
Like I asked Fred Benson a long, long time ago.

11:14.287 --> 11:17.214
I wish I could have interviewed him before his death.

11:17.735 --> 11:18.517
Same kind of thing.

11:18.577 --> 11:26.395
And he said, you didn't ever wink or make a pass at any female other than your own wife.

11:27.477 --> 11:29.462
You didn't play poker for money.

11:29.763 --> 11:44.219
unless you closed the blinds, if you and the buddies were, and if you were serving alcoholic beverage, you never, ever, ever served alcohol at any kind of an event in your home if there were students present.

11:45.140 --> 11:46.221
I think that's right.

11:46.241 --> 11:46.882
You just didn't do it.

11:46.902 --> 11:47.623
You just knew it.

11:47.783 --> 11:49.585
Yeah, yeah.

11:50.306 --> 11:50.686
Let's see.

11:50.746 --> 11:52.968
What have we not covered that we should have?

11:53.569 --> 11:54.650
I haven't given you much.

11:54.811 --> 11:56.192
It's very interesting.

11:56.780 --> 12:05.833
I realize that, but we discussed that early, why I'm not, was not part of the campus scene.

12:05.853 --> 12:07.556
Yeah, you weren't in the classroom very much.

12:07.576 --> 12:08.177
No, I wasn't, no.

12:09.038 --> 12:15.207
I remember mostly the people that I took classes with, the profs that I had.

12:15.227 --> 12:15.548
Oh, sure.

12:15.608 --> 12:16.489
Describe that.

12:17.110 --> 12:18.212
Who were some of those people?

12:18.612 --> 12:19.113
Wayne Hall.

12:19.634 --> 12:21.376
Describe him as an instructor.

12:21.937 --> 12:26.584
He was very good, very knowledgeable, tough, I thought.

12:27.070 --> 12:28.492
But it was a tough subject.

12:29.974 --> 12:32.538
One that made quite an impression on me was C.B.

12:34.361 --> 12:34.882
Godby.

12:37.305 --> 12:42.333
Had my first exposure to biometry and statistics with that man.

12:43.434 --> 12:51.787
He was kind of a fatherly, patriarchal character, which highly respected all of us graduate students.

12:52.408 --> 12:53.169
Took his courses.

12:53.309 --> 12:55.913
We loved him.

12:59.133 --> 13:05.081
I'm trying to think who, it's interesting, God be made more an impression on me than anybody, I suppose.

13:05.101 --> 13:06.703
Now, who directed your dissertation?

13:07.304 --> 13:10.989
Richmond.

13:11.009 --> 13:12.691
Hall was on my committee.

13:13.933 --> 13:14.253
That's right.

13:14.273 --> 13:21.743
Do you remember any, any question, key questions by anybody at your doctoral defense?

13:24.587 --> 13:24.887
Yeah.

13:27.179 --> 13:29.161
I don't remember who asked this.

13:30.442 --> 13:31.604
It might have been Wayne Hall.

13:32.525 --> 13:42.075
If I knew what a Kentucky, a Kentucky some kind of horse was.

13:42.715 --> 13:45.098
Well, that would probably have been Hall, because he was at Kentucky.

13:45.118 --> 13:46.860
And I didn't have to do that.

13:46.880 --> 13:50.884
The rest of the committee sat there and argued about it for 10 or 15 minutes.

13:51.245 --> 13:55.729
I just sat there and listened.

13:55.749 --> 13:56.410
That was fun.

13:57.723 --> 14:19.393
and uh let's see when you uh when you you finished your degree in what year 59 59 so was rudder yet the president rudder was or had just been designated probably i think he was president okay would that be on there

14:23.997 --> 14:24.317
No.

14:25.439 --> 14:26.140
Harrington's on.

14:26.160 --> 14:26.781
Harrington, okay.

14:26.801 --> 14:27.282
And Heaton.

14:27.843 --> 14:29.045
No, the president's not on there.

14:29.826 --> 14:33.832
I think Rudder, he must have been president then.

14:36.336 --> 14:45.710
As a member of the professional group here at A&M, how much did you see of Earl Rudder while he was president?

14:46.471 --> 14:46.912
Not much.

14:48.034 --> 14:50.157
What was your, what impression did you have of him?

14:54.575 --> 14:58.902
Well, nothing spectacular, nothing specific.

14:58.942 --> 15:00.023
He just was president.

15:00.664 --> 15:12.102
He was over there, and he used to come once in a while to a meeting or to our staff conferences, but I had no, certainly no direct contact with him.

15:13.064 --> 15:19.013
And then when Hall became his vice president of academic affairs, did you agricultural people feel good about that?

15:21.305 --> 15:21.906
Probably.

15:22.166 --> 15:23.567
I don't remember particularly.

15:24.748 --> 15:29.833
And, let's see, Dean of Agriculture during, was Patterson?

15:30.013 --> 15:30.513
Patterson.

15:31.334 --> 15:32.115
Describe him.

15:32.295 --> 15:32.475
R.E.

15:32.495 --> 15:32.956
Patterson.

15:32.996 --> 15:36.579
Describe him as far as you recall the way you all thought of him as Dean.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.081
Patterson could be difficult.

15:42.504 --> 15:43.645
How else can I describe?

15:44.766 --> 15:49.050
One day you could go in to see him and he was just congenial.

15:50.313 --> 15:58.081
And if he didn't like something or it hit him wrong, he could be very verbal about it.

15:58.101 --> 15:58.341
All right.

15:58.381 --> 16:05.428
Then when he moved up to the system level, Gus Watkins then kind of followed.

16:06.049 --> 16:07.350
Was he different?

16:07.550 --> 16:08.571
Gus, oh yeah.

16:09.652 --> 16:16.839
Gus was a very personable, easy going, easy to get along with.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.662
I thought very good.

16:21.683 --> 16:23.586
As an administrator, I really don't know.

16:24.829 --> 16:29.978
But as a person in that post, I thought Gus was great.

16:30.459 --> 16:31.321
What about Harry Kunkel?

16:33.465 --> 16:35.168
I didn't have great rapport with Kunkel.

16:37.773 --> 16:45.126
I had a class from him, one of the first classes he taught here in biochemical genetics.

16:45.916 --> 16:51.081
I found that people either liked him as an instructor or didn't like him as an instructor.

16:51.101 --> 16:53.083
Very indifferent about him as an instructor.

16:53.584 --> 16:54.865
I was not very impressed.

16:55.706 --> 17:04.615
But my contacts with him beyond that didn't particularly impress me either.

17:04.655 --> 17:07.798
I found him contentious much of the time.

17:10.882 --> 17:14.185
Then when Dr. Williams came, did you all have any

17:15.127 --> 17:16.870
Any impression of him?

17:17.852 --> 17:20.478
No, not really, because he was an outsider.

17:21.620 --> 17:25.748
He was academically oriented.

17:26.650 --> 17:27.612
He was a different thing.

17:28.714 --> 17:34.806
So if anything, we probably sort of held our breath and said, well, we got a new one now that's not one of our breed.

17:34.921 --> 17:46.035
In the 60s and 70s and 80s, did the, all of the faculty and staff in agriculture get together once a semester or once a year for any kind of big meeting?

17:46.716 --> 17:46.876
Yeah.

17:46.896 --> 17:47.857
We had an annual conference.

17:48.879 --> 17:50.340
Well, there were two.

17:50.681 --> 17:52.864
There was an extension conference.

17:53.544 --> 17:55.387
There was an experiment station conference.

17:56.068 --> 18:03.477
Well, nearly all of the people in agriculture who even were teaching were part of the experiment station.

18:03.963 --> 18:08.688
There weren't too many, I think, that were full teaching faculty.

18:09.288 --> 18:11.911
And how long did those last and what was their function?

18:11.931 --> 18:12.532
About three days.

18:13.012 --> 18:13.933
Where were they here?

18:14.834 --> 18:17.096
And what was the purpose of them?

18:17.116 --> 18:18.217
That's what we always wondered.

18:20.880 --> 18:29.869
We used to think it was a good, a good occasion for the directors to kind of lay down the law and review programs and,

18:31.165 --> 18:37.512
talk about what is in store, legislative outlooks, new programs.

18:37.933 --> 18:41.537
They would bring in some pretty good speakers from other universities.

18:42.458 --> 18:47.423
Was there some appropriate bragging of accomplishments by Texas A&M?

18:48.064 --> 18:50.186
Yeah, yeah, to some extent.

18:50.707 --> 18:57.274
As far as y'all were aware, you and your colleagues, in Austin, which governor or other

18:57.608 --> 19:05.175
public officials deserve greatest credit for supporting A&M's research and other companies?

19:05.195 --> 19:06.036
I can't answer that.

19:06.136 --> 19:06.597
I don't know.

19:07.658 --> 19:08.619
So you don't know of any?

19:08.979 --> 19:13.583
There was nobody that was supposedly Tiger Teague or John Conley or?

19:13.643 --> 19:25.675
Teague probably, thinking back over the years, probably had as much identification with A&M as anyone that we knew about.

19:27.055 --> 19:29.338
Connelly, not particularly.

19:30.280 --> 19:35.427
No, I stayed too, too remote from that sort of thing.

19:35.447 --> 19:42.918
Let's see, and I asked you before if there were any ideas or proposals that you sent forward that didn't get funded and... Oh yeah, I had some of those.

19:43.198 --> 19:44.961
But, but... But nothing.

19:44.981 --> 19:45.522
No major.

19:45.842 --> 19:46.283
No.

19:46.303 --> 19:46.763
No major.

19:46.804 --> 19:48.186
Just minor disappointments.

19:50.549 --> 19:52.692
What else have we not covered that we should have?

19:56.823 --> 20:00.087
I thought of something a minute ago that's just a bit of an anecdote.

20:00.748 --> 20:04.073
We were talking about parking, what it is now and what it used to be.

20:04.493 --> 20:05.735
Oh, good, good.

20:05.815 --> 20:06.316
Describe that.

20:06.356 --> 20:12.504
Remember when we were in that old Experiment Station building up there on the campus?

20:12.524 --> 20:14.467
We parked right outside, of course.

20:15.468 --> 20:16.850
Bloodworth had his space.

20:17.851 --> 20:18.773
And it was so marked.

20:19.634 --> 20:22.037
As I recall, maybe the only reserved one.

20:23.439 --> 20:25.041
And it was always a great

20:25.797 --> 20:29.963
challenge for somebody to come in and park in Bloodworth's place.

20:31.566 --> 20:39.858
And if he'd find it, he had a big, as I recall, an orange placard at Easy.

20:41.681 --> 20:48.852
He'd taken plaster on the driver's side of that car with a note, you know, it'd be drawn and quartered.

20:51.262 --> 20:59.796
In fact, at his funeral, I recall that, and everybody in the audience that was around got a chuckle out, because we used to laugh about it.

21:00.036 --> 21:03.923
Now, the people who did park, were they likely to be a student or?

21:03.943 --> 21:05.585
Yeah, yeah.

21:05.605 --> 21:05.705
Okay.

21:05.725 --> 21:09.752
They'd sneak and park in his place, and he did not take kindly to that.

21:12.436 --> 21:18.366
Where, where, normal work day, where did you and your colleagues

21:18.430 --> 21:23.615
have coffee mid-morning or socialize, and where'd you have lunch?

21:26.578 --> 21:29.561
Well, to be very honest, I didn't do much of the socializing.

21:32.304 --> 21:38.490
When we were in the old Experiment Station building, we had a sort of a room, a coffee mess.

21:39.592 --> 21:43.215
But we didn't congregate much there because it wasn't large enough.

21:43.415 --> 21:44.016
Oh, okay.

21:44.350 --> 21:47.394
We did that mostly in our own quarters.

21:48.937 --> 22:04.600
Later on, as we got into the other big building over the Heap Building, there is a lecture room up there, and which, adjacent to the coffee mess, and that is normally where folks about 10 o'clock congregate for social.

22:05.421 --> 22:11.590
I did very little of that, because usually I was at my lab that's over behind the vet.

22:12.447 --> 22:13.128
complex.

22:14.450 --> 22:15.672
So I wasn't into that.

22:16.212 --> 22:19.577
Where did you eat lunch on a normal work day?

22:21.780 --> 22:33.777
Oh, sometimes we'd run across the railroad tracks to one of those hamburger places or occasionally and have my lunch or I'd run home.

22:34.618 --> 22:35.940
In those days you could run home.

22:40.966 --> 22:42.249
Alright, now what else?

22:45.496 --> 22:56.781
Can you think of any truly goofy and or remember any jokes, any good bull in the research lab or anything that

22:57.487 --> 22:58.308
No, I can.

22:58.829 --> 23:02.233
After you leave, I probably will, and after I lie down tonight, before I go to sleep.

23:02.633 --> 23:09.822
But also, you all didn't have run-of-the-mill undergraduates, and you didn't have corps members and all that.

23:10.523 --> 23:10.583
No.

23:10.603 --> 23:14.748
Oh, I'm talking about these high school students that we used.

23:17.251 --> 23:18.673
It was great having the kids around.

23:19.914 --> 23:23.258
And of course, kids being kids, they used to goof up.

23:23.812 --> 23:30.422
We had some very specific ways of accommodating their misdeeds.

23:31.744 --> 23:35.911
And one of them will remind me of this occasionally when I run into them.

23:35.971 --> 23:50.393
One of the punishments we used to do, well first let me go back and say a major fun thing for the kids when we weren't around, was to chunk green bowls at each other.

23:51.588 --> 23:54.431
I'll have to come back to that, the fact that we used to farm a lot out here.

23:55.693 --> 24:02.060
And one way we used to make them atone for that, we had cotton trailers.

24:02.080 --> 24:05.343
Remember how they were slatted side and so forth.

24:05.363 --> 24:15.655
Our favorite thing was to park one of those out in the open, give them an inch and a half paintbrush, a couple or three of them, and make them paint a cotton trailer in the middle of the summer.

24:18.082 --> 24:19.091
Horrible job.

24:19.837 --> 24:21.068
Hot as the dickens.

24:21.572 --> 24:22.742
That's what they'd have to do.

24:24.038 --> 24:39.677
Did any, did y'all have to worry in the real world about them in the cotton patch stumbling onto any kind of snake or insect that would bite them or anything?

24:39.697 --> 24:40.958
Because no centipedes or?

24:41.419 --> 24:41.599
No.

24:42.200 --> 24:42.681
That's what I thought.

24:42.701 --> 24:43.882
No snakes out there, are there?

24:44.242 --> 24:44.343
No.

24:45.344 --> 24:46.906
So you didn't have to worry about that.

24:48.347 --> 24:53.033
When those high school youngsters were doing that kind of work, where did they have lunch

24:54.430 --> 24:56.073
Did you all take food out to them?

24:56.333 --> 24:56.854
No, no.

24:56.894 --> 24:58.236
They brought their own lunch.

25:00.280 --> 25:00.460
Okay.

25:00.520 --> 25:03.225
Some of them might not come in the morning at all.

25:03.425 --> 25:05.649
Because this could be during hot weather.

25:05.669 --> 25:06.490
Oh, yeah.

25:06.510 --> 25:10.918
And they'd come into the lab and have their lunch.

25:12.240 --> 25:14.684
But that was a nice time.

25:14.744 --> 25:15.866
You can't do that anymore.

25:16.768 --> 25:19.392
You know, in my later years there, we couldn't do that.

25:19.912 --> 25:21.835
could hardly hire a youngster.

25:23.898 --> 25:44.788
As you look back on that, all those years, how was your life affected, as you think about it, by the fact that you ended up being a professional at Texas A&M instead of, what was different about A&M as far as you can recall?

25:46.895 --> 25:49.619
I was very proud to be a Texas Aggie.

25:50.260 --> 25:54.687
I was proud to be an employee of Texas A&M University.

25:54.707 --> 25:59.073
I thought it was, yeah, I was pretty proud of that.

25:59.153 --> 26:07.025
And I enjoyed going anywhere and being able to say I am from Texas A&M University because it meant something.

26:07.245 --> 26:10.129
Did you feel that A&M was making real progress during the year?

26:10.951 --> 26:11.251
Oh, yeah, yeah.

26:11.271 --> 26:14.556
And in the field I was in, there wasn't any better.

26:16.274 --> 26:23.724
The only one that could come close to it maybe would have been North Carolina State, maybe Mississippi State, not really.

26:24.565 --> 26:27.028
We were top dogs for a long while, I thought.

26:27.989 --> 26:34.157
See, that's what I tell people that, I've got a little speech I call Camelot on the Brazos, you know, the Kennedy family.

26:34.197 --> 26:37.742
Camelot was a special time, special place.

26:37.857 --> 26:41.182
During those years, we knew this place was moving forward.

26:41.202 --> 26:41.662
Oh, yes.

26:41.923 --> 26:44.907
It was, it was, it was making progress.

26:44.927 --> 26:49.634
We were envied, at least in the field I was in.

26:50.375 --> 26:54.260
And I can remember running into this when we'd go off to conferences and things.

26:54.280 --> 27:00.048
Yeah, there was a bit of envy about, darn Texans, have everything, know everything.

27:01.611 --> 27:04.355
And we used to monopolize things if we chose to do so.

27:05.616 --> 27:06.818
Programs and things.

27:07.405 --> 27:15.998
We're loaded with our people because we were pioneers in much of that research.

27:16.018 --> 27:16.459
Okay.

27:17.440 --> 27:20.245
I don't have what I can think of, but one question left.

27:21.286 --> 27:23.229
Let me go back to something I just thought of a minute ago.

27:23.249 --> 27:25.412
Oh, good, good.

27:25.432 --> 27:33.925
See, what most people don't realize is that we used to do a lot of farming right out here at the so-called agronomy farm.

27:34.406 --> 27:36.349
Historically, that goes back to the

27:37.274 --> 27:39.256
1890s or something like that.

27:39.536 --> 27:44.301
The vet school was a very small thing.

27:45.582 --> 27:48.565
Physical plants was a very small thing and it wasn't out there.

27:49.466 --> 28:03.079
I can remember when we had that old barn out there that there was grain sorghum and corn and soybeans and sunflowers and cotton and folks don't realize that that used to be

28:04.612 --> 28:09.360
our basic research location.

28:09.380 --> 28:11.904
Now you just don't do anything out there.

28:11.924 --> 28:13.687
Okay, go ahead with your question.

28:13.707 --> 28:22.161
Well, the last question I have is, what feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M today?

28:23.964 --> 28:29.353
I'm very proud of serving the university those years.

28:31.257 --> 28:35.384
I feel very fortunate in the opportunity to have done that.

28:36.866 --> 28:47.104
As I said earlier, I think I experienced the best years, maybe not of the university, but certainly of the Agricultural Experiment Station.

28:48.466 --> 28:52.152
And I'm not alone with those feelings.
