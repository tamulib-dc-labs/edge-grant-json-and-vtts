00:03.119 --> 00:23.450
First, Mr. Byrd, would you kind of summarize your 
early life, including the names of your parents,

00:03.119 --> 00:23.450
the dates of their birth and death, the places 
where they were born, the date and place of your

00:03.119 --> 00:23.450
birth, and the schools you attended before you 
went to A&M?

00:25.994 --> 00:32.063
My father was James L. Byrd, and he was born on a 
farm. near Corinth, Mississippi in

00:32.482 --> 00:39.611
1857.

00:42.535 --> 00:49.143
And my mother's name was Frances Lester Bird, 
L-E-S-T-E-R. Excuse me, Smith. Her maiden name

00:51.466 --> 00:53.168
was Smith. And she was born near Corinth, 
Mississippi on a farm. And they moved to Texas.

01:03.093 --> 01:10.685
about 1880, and Dad lived to be 95, and I've 
forgotten the date of his death. Mother lived to be

01:11.006 --> 01:26.190
71, and I've forgotten the exact date of her death, 
but they're buried at Waco, Texas, where we, the

01:11.006 --> 01:26.190
children, or the family generally was born and 
reared near Waco on a cotton farm. So you were born

01:26.210 --> 01:27.412
on a cotton farm? I was born on a cotton farm, born at 
Eddy, Texas. In Falls County, and we bought a farm

01:31.460 --> 01:35.625
in Limestone County. Drove us back to the Beacon 
County seat, and then after the farm wasn't big

01:36.026 --> 01:44.256
enough, so Dad bought a farm at Bruceville, Texas, 
and built a home. And we lived there about two

01:45.077 --> 01:52.467
years, I believe, and then bought a farm, a 
200-acre farm at Hewitt, Texas, near Waco. And

01:52.847 --> 01:58.935
that's where, in 1911, that's where we lived until 
we all left home and had her own families. So how

02:00.820 --> 02:02.242
large of a family did you? We had, I had five 
brothers and five sisters. So you had a total of 11

02:05.627 --> 02:07.169
in all. That's right, and I was next to the, next to 
the youngest brother, or child, so to speak. So did

02:15.000 --> 02:19.186
you went to school, you completed school in Waco 
then? No, I completed school at Hewitt High

02:19.326 --> 02:23.893
School, which was a a rather small high school even 
in those days, or school. It was a four-room school

02:28.600 --> 02:33.406
about six miles from Waco. And when I finished high 
school there in 1916, I tried to join the Army, and I

02:33.426 --> 02:41.816
couldn't. I was too young. Well, it was not really 
in 1917. And I was 16 years old, and I couldn't get

02:45.781 --> 02:54.893
the approval of my parents to join the Army, so they 
sent me to a military school at Arlington. Texas,

02:55.750 --> 02:58.735
which is now University of Texas at Arlington. But 
it was a military school belonging to the state of

02:58.755 --> 03:02.160
Texas. I spent two years there. Academy? Well, it 
was, no, it was, well, two years high school and two

03:06.306 --> 03:12.816
years junior college, really, is what it was. Same 
as John Tarleton today. Of course, John Tarleton

03:15.320 --> 03:17.644
Senior College today. So you went, what would be 
the equivalent of two years of junior college at

03:24.151 --> 03:31.139
No, I finished high school at the school and took 
one year of college. I was sort of interested in

03:31.159 --> 03:36.305
athletics, and the coaches sold me on the idea of 
staying over. I did take my freshman college year

03:36.365 --> 03:38.867
there. In Arlington. And I was in the military. And 
that's the reason they sent me up. My mother and

03:43.613 --> 03:46.996
daddy were real smart about this military 
business. They knew I'd be satisfied if I got in the

03:47.016 --> 03:50.901
uniform, and I was. And I was... there two years and 
then went to Texas A&M in 1920. So the idea of being

03:58.997 --> 04:04.903
in the military was one factor in your going to A&M. 
That's right. Anything else involved in your

04:05.964 --> 04:07.646
choice? No, I think I'd heard so much about A&M and 
some fellows from my home community had gone to A&M

04:08.187 --> 04:23.082
and they were highly appreciative of A&M and I 
wanted to go to A&M College. And as far as entering,

04:24.108 --> 04:28.235
then, did you have to supply a transcript to your 
grades? I think I did, but I did enter as a sophomore

04:30.218 --> 04:33.323
or freshman. You entered as a sophomore? In 
classification, and a freshman, of course, my

04:35.346 --> 04:39.313
freshman year. And then I stayed out one year and 
worked in the oil fields, and then did finish with

04:39.994 --> 04:49.930
the class I entered with, the class of 1924. You 
entered as a sophomore in 1920. That's right. I

04:54.337 --> 04:57.981
should have graduated with a class of 23 had I gone 
right on. Well, as an entering sophomore, were you

04:58.001 --> 05:04.147
subjected to any of the types of things that the 
freshmen... I think, really, Charles, I was

05:04.167 --> 05:17.942
subjected to more because I probably had lent 
myself, so to speak, to that because I had been in

05:04.167 --> 05:17.942
the military school, and I enjoyed the fun part. 
And in fact, I'd been a captain in this military

05:18.783 --> 05:27.598
school, and I knew a little bit about military, and 
I might have been a year more older than most of the

05:18.783 --> 05:27.598
freshmen. In fact, I was. But I enjoyed all those 
activities that went on in the rooms and over the

05:29.942 --> 05:37.635
campus.

05:39.235 --> 05:41.839
Well, it was just a great experience. Were you 
hazed like a freshman? I was hazed like a freshman,

05:43.322 --> 05:53.719
and more so than a lot of the freshmen, because I was 
in sophomore classes, and I think more sophomores

05:43.322 --> 05:53.719
knew me than they would the average freshman. But 
you couldn't do any hazing at that point? No, no,

05:55.823 --> 05:57.666
no. You were a sophomore only as far as the school 
was concerned. As far as the school was concerned.

06:01.843 --> 06:03.286
Whereas the military, you were a fish. I was a fish, 
a rank fish. What were your impressions of,

06:06.612 --> 06:15.509
obviously you were somewhat familiar with A&M and 
the military when you arrived. Was it really kind

06:16.972 --> 06:19.857
of what you expected it to be when you got there? I 
think it was because of the fact that I knew some

06:20.022 --> 06:34.240
fellows who had gone to A&M or who were in A&M at home 
and they had told me about A&M and I wasn't

06:20.022 --> 06:34.240
surprised at all. It was just wonderful from the 
first day I got there carrying the trunks up for the

06:34.861 --> 06:45.895
sophomores from the depot until I graduated in 
1924. When you arrived there and registered and

06:46.448 --> 06:57.405
then were assigned or entered a military company, 
did you have any choice in the company you were

06:46.448 --> 06:57.405
assigned to? Yes, I did. And I was encouraged by 
some troopers, some people in the cavalry, to join

06:58.487 --> 07:06.039
that organization, which I did. So you opted for 
the cavalry. I did. And I liked horses, too. You

07:10.005 --> 07:12.089
stayed in the cavalry all the years. All the three 
years I was there. Did being in the cavalry require

07:16.148 --> 07:24.337
more of your time than, say, being in the infantry? 
It probably did. It probably did. And we had a lot of

07:26.800 --> 07:30.184
esprit de corps. And we had almost the entire 
basketball team in our troop my freshman year who

07:31.145 --> 07:39.054
were members of the cavalry. I mean, the varsity 
basketball. And it was just a great organization.

07:46.017 --> 07:52.865
When you were in the cavalry, did each cadet take 
care of his own horse? No. No, that was done by the

07:54.147 --> 08:01.375
military, by the army, the cavalry personnel, the 
regular cavalry personnel. They took care of the

08:01.395 --> 08:03.698
animals and the equipment. And we only saw those 
animals when we drilled. And how much of the time

08:06.541 --> 08:08.324
did you drill? We drilled two hours a week on 
horses. Uh-huh. Did you also have to do marching

08:12.258 --> 08:15.142
drill? To some extent, yes. So even though you were 
ostensibly riders, you had to march some. That's

08:21.029 --> 08:22.431
right, we had to march some, yes. Would you 
describe a typical day during the time that you

08:25.194 --> 08:29.539
were there? Well, I think a typical day during the 
time I was there would be, I've forgotten the time

08:30.441 --> 08:39.632
we would get up, but anyway, we'd dress for 
breakfast. and had formation for breakfast. And

08:43.889 --> 08:47.672
out in front of, we were in Leggett Hall at that 
time. And we would, it was two troops, Troop A and B,

08:49.014 --> 08:57.723
I was in A, and we had marched to breakfast. And then 
we would return after breakfast, not in

08:57.743 --> 09:07.813
formation, and clean our rooms and maybe two or 
three sophomores' rooms. and be ready for

09:08.840 --> 09:10.864
classes. And we did not march to Speza Hall for 
lunch. You did not? We did not. I'm just pretty sure

09:20.726 --> 09:25.937
I'm right about that, Charles, but I don't 
remember all those organizations at noon. That

09:26.373 --> 09:29.436
would have been a change to what it would have been 
previously. Did they have most? Everybody else I

09:31.938 --> 09:36.683
talked to earlier than that said they marched to 
all three meals. Well, maybe we did. I know we did

09:38.044 --> 09:43.990
the morning meal and the evening meal, and it's 
possible we did, but I'd forgotten just a little

09:38.044 --> 09:43.990
bit about that. I wasn't 100% sure that we did march 
to lunch. And then what did you do in the afternoon?

09:51.056 --> 09:54.760
And, of course, we had classes during those 
periods of time. I spent quite a bit of time in the

09:56.562 --> 10:05.895
library, and then of course we'd have meetings in 
various sophomores' rooms my freshman year. Bull

10:06.176 --> 10:06.777
session? Bull session, maybe a little bit more 
than that. But it was all in fun, and I think that was

10:09.961 --> 10:21.237
one of the things that caused A&M to be such a fine 
school insofar as comradeship is concerned

10:21.942 --> 10:47.764
because we were all the sophomores were concerned 
about us and they wanted us to be they wanted us to

10:21.942 --> 10:47.764
stay in school and and they wanted us to study and 
they did see that we studied you I presume you had a

10:21.942 --> 10:47.764
period in the evening which was required study 
time that's right like we surely did and we had to be

10:21.942 --> 10:47.764
in our rooms and and we did have about I think about 
three hours. I believe that's what it was. You

10:50.532 --> 10:52.915
indicated earlier you had spent a good bit of time 
in the library. If you wanted to be in the library

10:53.336 --> 10:59.123
during that quiet time, did you have to have a 
special permit to go to the library? I would get

10:59.143 --> 11:03.730
permission from the captain of the troop. Nothing 
in writing necessarily? No, not necessarily.

11:07.274 --> 11:09.677
That's right.

11:11.480 --> 11:13.102
That's all my freshman year. The sophomores and 
upperclassmen didn't have those. I guess they'd

11:17.157 --> 11:19.579
go to the library anytime they wanted to. And then 
between your, what was it, between your freshman

11:20.921 --> 11:25.805
and sophomore year that you dropped out? No, I 
dropped out between, see I entered as a sophomore,

11:25.885 --> 11:32.832
and it was between my freshman, actually, the 
first year. But I dropped out between my sophomore

11:33.533 --> 11:42.802
and junior year in classification and worked in 
the oil fields one summer, or one year. It was about

11:42.842 --> 11:44.023
nine months. And then went back to school the next 
fall. So you entered as a sophomore, and you joined

11:48.798 --> 11:52.101
that same. So you entered as a sophomore in 
classification. And when you came back, you were

11:57.506 --> 12:01.169
in line with the people who were freshmen. I was a 
junior with the people whom I was a freshman with.

12:08.056 --> 12:16.864
OK.

12:08.056 --> 12:16.864
How was the food in the mess hall?

12:20.202 --> 12:24.046
Well, I thought the food was all right most of the 
time. Of course, my freshman year, I didn't get

12:25.347 --> 12:27.729
very much dessert. Sophomores got that. But I 
think it was adequate. But I think that so many of us

12:30.872 --> 12:41.683
are prone to criticize some of those things, and 
maybe with justification, some of them. But I had

12:41.703 --> 12:46.708
worked in the oil fields, and I'd been to this 
military school before. I mean, two years before.

12:49.295 --> 12:54.442
I went to A&M, and I thought the food was just about 
what you'd expect. A little bit monotonous at

12:54.662 --> 12:55.764
times. A little bit monotonous at times, that's 
right, but just about what you'd expect. We're

12:59.549 --> 13:01.852
feeding a great number of people. A number of 
people have kind of indicated the highlight was

13:03.254 --> 13:07.140
the steak on Thursday. Did you have steak on 
Thursday? Well, I'm not sure about the date, but we

13:08.441 --> 13:12.427
did have steak from time to time. Fortunately, I 
didn't let her on the varsity, but I did play

13:13.308 --> 13:19.116
freshman athletics some, And I got to eat on the 
training table, and that's where we had those

13:20.024 --> 13:24.710
delicious steaks every evening. Every evening. 
Yeah. At that training table, say, if you played

13:26.994 --> 13:34.324
basketball, did you eat at the training table the 
whole year or just during basketball season? No,

13:34.344 --> 13:35.245
just during the season. Seemed to be for all of the 
other sports. That's right, all the rest of them,

13:37.168 --> 13:39.971
yeah. I believe you said you were in Milner? No, 
Leggett. Leggett Hall. Were you in Leggett all the

13:49.090 --> 13:51.653
years you were there? No, I was in Leggett one year 
and then Mitchell the other two. Mitchell and the

13:55.838 --> 13:56.659
other two. Yeah. Was that, well, both of them were 
relatively new at that point, were they not? No,

14:01.264 --> 14:02.186
Leggett wasn't. Leggett's one of the old halls. In 
fact, I saw that in this book of, I think, Dean Stang

14:03.747 --> 14:13.159
was, but it's one of the early halls that was built 
in an early period. And Mitchell was later. And

14:17.112 --> 14:23.220
junior and senior year, I was in Mitchell Hall. 
That's interesting. Leggett's still there in

14:24.001 --> 14:25.363
Mitchell's, huh? That's right. I was going to make 
that comment. We were down there last two or three

14:27.185 --> 14:31.010
months ago.

14:34.715 --> 14:42.706
Did the upperclassmen, I gather from what you've 
said, this is true, but the upperclassmen, as a

14:34.715 --> 14:42.706
rule, had a good bit more privileges than the 
freshmen. They did, yes, sir. more freedom to move

14:45.361 --> 14:48.464
around campus. What about during that quiet hour? 
Did basically all four levels have to be in their

14:50.887 --> 14:55.833
room studying? Well, I think generally they did. 
I'm sure the juniors and seniors probably didn't

14:57.915 --> 15:06.544
have to adhere to that so strictly as the 
sophomores and freshmen did. Some of the

15:08.046 --> 15:14.473
upperclassmen or sophomores were just an 
overgrown freshman.

15:15.820 --> 15:19.164
Did they line you up and march you to chapel on 
Sunday? Yes, they did. In Guyon Hall? That's

15:21.147 --> 15:21.727
right. Did the seniors have to go, too? Seniors, 
maybe one senior from the Troop A cavalry, in my

15:24.491 --> 15:35.245
instance, marched all those to Guyon Hall, just 
one, as I recall. So most of the seniors skipped out

15:35.525 --> 15:37.948
on that? Yeah, they didn't have to go. They would 
alternate on that. Was that maybe because the core

15:41.318 --> 15:46.046
was large enough that there wasn't enough room for 
all of them? It could be. It could be.

15:51.114 --> 15:56.924
At the time that you were there, what could you do 
for recreation and entertainment? Well, we had

15:56.944 --> 15:58.347
the YMCA. We could swim. And we had all those, 
there's athletics going on all the time, some type

15:59.268 --> 16:06.961
of athletics. Mm-hmm. And we might be interested 
in company basketball, or company baseball, or

16:07.930 --> 16:13.180
company football. And of course, there's always 
some sessions in the various rooms. Being in the

16:21.802 --> 16:32.393
cavalry, we were able to go on some hikes with our 
horses, riding horses on weekends occasionally

16:21.802 --> 16:32.393
when we could get permission to do that. Now, would 
this be the whole company or just individuals? No,

16:35.376 --> 16:38.059
it would be just individuals, two or three or four 
or five individuals. Just to go kind of check out a

16:38.199 --> 16:39.460
horse? That's right, that's right. Go for a good 
ride. Yeah, that's right.

16:47.709 --> 16:47.809
Okay.

16:53.948 --> 17:03.860
was, this is not really entertainment and 
recreation, but I believe the year after you

16:53.948 --> 17:03.860
graduated was the year that Harold Dunn had his 
famous hamburger stand on the campus. But he told

17:04.982 --> 17:09.367
me that that stand was there two or three years 
before that. It was. It was near Speeds to Hall, as I

17:09.708 --> 17:14.193
recall, and it was a newsstand and a hamburger 
stand. News and hamburger combined. Yeah, when I

17:15.755 --> 17:17.357
knew it. He didn't indicate that he had anything to 
do with the newspapers. It might have been

17:20.817 --> 17:23.580
magazines. So that was there for if anybody wanted 
supplemental food. Was there still Casey's

17:30.850 --> 17:34.655
Confectionery in the basement? That was a central 
meeting point. Somebody had 15 or 25 cents to buy a

17:38.441 --> 17:41.725
malted milk. That was in the basement of the Y. 
That's the basement of the Y, and I think the Y is

17:43.417 --> 17:47.261
still there. Yeah, the Y is still there. The 
swimming pool is not there. No. Nor is the

17:51.084 --> 17:52.225
confectionery. Yeah. But were there any rooms in 
the Y that people could stay as there

17:53.486 --> 18:02.795
traditionally is in a Y? Charles, I'm not real 
sure. I am not positive about that, but we had Alpha

18:05.597 --> 18:10.041
and Beta Hall where people could stay. And they 
were located where? They were located up near

18:11.548 --> 18:13.430
Speza. Now that was before the Aggieland Inn. Yes, 
that's right.

18:22.243 --> 18:28.312
So I believe at one point, I understood Alpha and 
Beta Hall were non-military dorms. That's right.

18:29.673 --> 18:31.216
Well, they could have been. Maybe World War I 
veterans. I'd rather think those are the fellows

18:35.922 --> 18:39.167
who stayed there. But did they also have rooms that 
the visitor could stay in? I'm just sure in alpha

18:43.406 --> 18:49.155
and beta because I stayed there two or three times 
after I graduated from A&M. I would be at A&M

18:49.175 --> 18:53.181
visiting A&M, and I have stayed there.

18:56.466 --> 18:58.008
Did you have any favorite instructors? Well, I had 
some real fine instructors that I just loved right

18:58.969 --> 19:07.382
on down through the years.

19:09.033 --> 19:12.037
I think Dr. C.C. Hedges, chemistry department, I 
enjoyed him very, very much. And I enjoyed Dr. O.M.

19:18.646 --> 19:21.670
Ball, the head of the botany department. My major 
was agronomy. And I think one reason I appreciated

19:23.973 --> 19:35.428
Dr. Ball so much, because being in a sophomore 
class, my freshman year, I was taking botany my

19:23.973 --> 19:35.428
freshman year as a sophomore. And Dr. Ball 
recognized the fact that I was being hazed by those

19:36.421 --> 19:47.638
sophomores, and I think he's the one professor 
whom I had a drag with, so to speak. That's how we

19:47.658 --> 19:52.766
expressed it back in those days, because he 
thought I was being abused by the sophomores. And

19:53.607 --> 19:56.671
it was great fun, but he was a great instructor. And 
Dr. Jones in the English department, and Colonel

19:56.691 --> 20:04.403
Ike Ashburn, commandant, I thought he was a grand 
person, and I admired him greatly, and he was

20:04.619 --> 20:11.985
thoroughly capable. You indicated you had spent a 
good bit of time in the library. Did you ever have

20:15.489 --> 20:17.630
any contact with Dr. Mayo? Yes, I did. English. I 
surely did. And he also was a librarian, I believe.

20:22.795 --> 20:25.077
That's right, he was. And Captain Davis, I've 
forgotten his first name and initials, but he was

20:25.097 --> 20:33.124
head of the cavalry. at the time I was there, and he 
was a great military person. I admired him a great

20:37.398 --> 20:38.680
deal. He would have been, what, directly under Ike 
Ashburn? Well, yes, yes. I don't know just what

20:43.705 --> 20:52.254
Ike's relationship was with the regular military 
personnel on that campus. It gets a little vague to

20:52.294 --> 20:54.277
me. He had been out of the military for a number of 
years. He had been a colonel, yeah. But he was

20:58.501 --> 21:02.065
commandant of the cadets, of the cadet corps, 
really. That was his title. He would have been a

21:04.252 --> 21:06.795
colonel perhaps during the First World War. Yes. 
And then he was out of the military for a while.

21:09.558 --> 21:10.900
That's right. He was actually a civilian 
commandant. That's right. He was not reappointed

21:15.245 --> 21:17.068
to the military. No, he did not wear a uniform.

21:21.814 --> 21:24.697
But he was very well liked by the students overall. 
Greatly appreciated by the students. He was fair

21:26.579 --> 21:32.727
and fine, and being a military man, he stood up tall 
and sat down. Tall in the saddle, I'll say, and

21:33.770 --> 21:40.179
everybody had a great deal of respect for him.

21:42.161 --> 21:46.107
What about the students' attitude to the 
president, Dr. Brazell? Well, Dr. Brazell was one

21:47.188 --> 21:56.641
of the fine gentlemen I've known in college or out 
of college. He was a great person. And I know the

21:58.904 --> 22:02.629
students respected Dr. Brazell a great deal. 
because he was a gentleman and a great educator. I

22:07.793 --> 22:15.869
had always, and I really have no real reason to

22:07.793 --> 22:15.869
change my attitude. In what I had heard and read 
about Dr. Brazell, I thought he must have been

22:16.691 --> 22:24.786
really something, one of the best they've had 
there for a long time. I think so. One of, another

22:25.559 --> 22:36.151
former student brought to us, I guess I would call 
it an underground newspaper called the Longbat

22:25.559 --> 22:36.151
that was, I believe, in January of 24. And I was a 
little bit puzzled by one of the student

22:37.533 --> 22:50.368
editorials in there that indicated they were 
complaining, I guess, about censorship of

22:37.533 --> 22:50.368
student opinions. And I don't know whether it was 
in the battalion that there was censorship or

22:50.804 --> 23:03.320
what, but anyway, the guy who wrote the editorial 
said something to the effect that he was

22:50.804 --> 23:03.320
complaining about not being able to say what you 
really thought. And he said, if you don't believe

23:03.500 --> 23:14.854
this is right, why, get up in the middle of the main 
building and say what you think, and then count how

23:03.500 --> 23:14.854
many minutes it is till the next train comes 
through, and that's how long you have to stay.

23:15.880 --> 23:22.730
Well, I didn't have that feeling about Dr. Brazell 
or anyone on that campus, and I might not have been

23:15.880 --> 23:22.730
that close to him. Well, I really never did know for 
sure whether it was Dr. Brazell they were talking

23:23.010 --> 23:31.943
about or the commandant or whether they were 
talking about... I don't think they were talking

23:31.963 --> 23:38.212
about upperclassmen because I understood that it 
was a group of seniors who got out this issue of the

23:31.963 --> 23:38.212
newspaper.

23:41.617 --> 23:44.260
Now, those seniors, would they have been in the 
class of 24? I believe so.

23:48.854 --> 23:50.876
I don't remember anything about that. I believe it 
was January 24 that they called it. It was a little

23:53.640 --> 24:00.848
bitty thing about, oh, 12, 14 inches tall and about 
10 or 11 inches wide. It was a four-page thing

24:01.689 --> 24:03.792
called the long bat. And I believe they had some 
things to say about the barbershop, and I believe

24:05.994 --> 24:15.866
Charlie Nitchie was still there in the tailor 
shop. He was a tailor. I'm not sure, but they were a

24:18.132 --> 24:21.917
little bit unkind to Casey's Confectionery. 
Well, I have an idea. Those boys just wanted to,

24:22.999 --> 24:29.428
they were becoming young men, I think, possibly 
they just wanted to express themselves. I think

24:29.448 --> 24:35.236
that's psychologically a fact many times when we 
want to criticize something, we just want to

24:29.448 --> 24:35.236
launch out. One

24:38.000 --> 24:45.490
of the things that I have thought since I've been in 
A&M that makes it a, An interesting institution

24:45.892 --> 24:55.503
and different from others is the number of 
traditions that exist there carried on by the

24:45.892 --> 24:55.503
students from year to year. And I'm thinking in 
terms of old Yale practice, the silver taps, the

24:55.523 --> 25:04.553
bonfire, and things of that nature. How many of 
these were in existence during your years there?

25:08.978 --> 25:13.924
Well, those three or four ones that you mentioned 
were certainly We had silver taps, and it happened

25:14.866 --> 25:18.511
at least twice while I was there. And we had yell 
practice, which we thoroughly enjoyed, and I

25:20.775 --> 25:28.826
think that was something that brought us together 
and made us feel as one. And the general, of course,

25:30.649 --> 25:38.360
it was all cadet corps, except the casuals, who 
were World War I veterans. My freshman in South

25:40.323 --> 25:41.785
Wales, Not necessarily the World War. Well, some 
of them were veterans who had been, stayed out of

25:44.361 --> 25:48.366
school a while. And I know one of my real fine 
friends was a World War, had been in the Navy in

25:48.426 --> 25:53.191
World War I. And he finished in my class, and he was 
not in the cadet corps. And those, but anyway. He

26:00.919 --> 26:02.181
was not in the cadet corps at all. No, not at all. And 
many, and I won't, quite a few weren't in the cadet

26:03.262 --> 26:07.546
corps. And they were not in the cadet corps because 
of the fact they had served in World War I. even

26:12.578 --> 26:14.820
though it might have been, well, 1920. Of course, 
the war was over in 1918.

26:19.445 --> 26:26.713
But I think the Yale practice, and I'm not so sure 
about the bonfire. We had some, but not to the

26:26.813 --> 26:31.758
magnitude that they do it now. But we did have a 
great spirit. And did you have a muster on April

26:35.422 --> 26:39.046
21st? I'm just sure we did not. I don't recall that. 
But how about, did you have a holiday? I'm not real

26:47.106 --> 26:51.152
sure about that. I had understood from what I had 
been able to find out about the start of that 1903

26:52.514 --> 27:03.751
that the students objected to going to school on 
Texas Independence Day.

27:05.553 --> 27:07.196
Or is that Texas Independence Day? Anyway, on that 
particular date. And so they sort of declared an

27:09.110 --> 27:16.943
unofficial holiday and had a muster, so to speak. 
Well, I'm sorry I'm not sure about that, but I'm

27:16.963 --> 27:20.348
really not. We recognized April 21st. Today we 
have school, but we have a muster at 5 o'clock. And

27:28.021 --> 27:32.288
it's observed pretty much worldwide, though, by 
former students. And I guess it really is more of a

27:32.789 --> 27:35.573
former student ceremony than a student one. You

27:40.702 --> 27:59.059
mentioned a minute ago that the veterans of the 
First World War were not in the Corps of Cadets, and

27:40.702 --> 27:59.059
I think there had always been a number who were 
physically incapable of carrying out the

27:40.702 --> 27:59.059
military duties. Was there any period during the 
time that you were there that that anybody other

28:05.945 --> 28:13.396
than the veterans and the physically handicapped 
could, say, discontinue the Corps after the first

28:05.945 --> 28:13.396
couple years? Charles, I don't think there was. I 
just don't think there was. Somebody I talked to

28:18.384 --> 28:29.581
yesterday indicated, well, he dropped out of the 
Corps after a couple years, but then he said in

28:18.384 --> 28:29.581
their senior year, I think he was there for five 
years, and last year he had to wear a uniform. For

28:30.382 --> 28:32.385
two years, he didn't wear a uniform. Well, those 
who... And I think that came later when they were

28:34.126 --> 28:41.894
not given commissions in the junior year. I mean, 
they were not qualified to go on and get a

28:42.014 --> 28:47.880
commission.

28:49.282 --> 28:52.926
Quite a few of those fellows didn't know anything 
about that until the end of their senior year. I

28:53.006 --> 29:00.994
know there's several that were still in the cadet 
corps who did not get reserve commissions. This

29:02.733 --> 29:03.955
was when you were in school? When I was in school, 
that's right. Was that because they were somewhat

29:05.958 --> 29:13.229
deficient in their military interest, I'd say. I 
think most anyone could have gotten commission

29:13.389 --> 29:19.378
had they been interested enough in military.

29:20.359 --> 29:24.265
Reserve commission.

29:26.135 --> 29:33.484
We know that a number of students throughout the 
history of A&M have been part-time employees in

29:26.135 --> 29:33.484
one form or another. Did you have any jobs? I didn't 
have any jobs, Charles. I worked in the oil fields a

29:37.248 --> 29:43.255
total of nine months in the summer. You didn't have 
any part-time jobs? I didn't have any part-time

29:44.837 --> 29:46.399
jobs.

29:49.303 --> 29:55.450
We had a wonderful farm at home, and the family 
could have sent me to school. But I wanted to get a

29:56.476 --> 30:05.732
little independent, and I did make my way the last 
two or three years in the oil fields, working in the

29:56.476 --> 30:05.732
oil fields. And I did not work at A&M. So you worked 
in the oil fields in the summer? In the summer,

30:12.042 --> 30:15.568
except when I went to two ROTC camps. Shirley?
