WEBVTT

00:02.933 --> 00:16.250
And sort of the same problem is, I'm not sure quite 
yet, the county organizations feature and

00:02.933 --> 00:16.250
explain briefly about, but I really want to just 
give a composite view of the world, the Texas

00:02.933 --> 00:16.250
world. When I lived in Grandview and was in 
practice, I was a member of the Tarrant County

00:16.510 --> 00:22.959
Veterinary Medical Association. When I was in 
Houston, the Harris County. Then the Harris

00:27.368 --> 00:35.881
County group splintered off, and they had the 
large animal practitioners in Harris County, and

00:27.368 --> 00:35.881
they had the Harris County Veterinary Medical 
Association. So, you know, somewhere you need to

00:35.901 --> 00:37.924
mention that. I suppose that still exists. As far 
as I know, they've done a lot of those county

00:41.589 --> 00:47.878
histories, and I've got most of that material, I 
believe. I gave a program there eight or ten years

00:48.960 --> 00:54.608
ago with a large animal group out on the way 
somewhere up from Houston. Let's close, I guess,

00:55.685 --> 00:57.328
with this thought. What are the big, as you see it, 
trends in veterinary medicine or developing

00:57.568 --> 01:13.676
problems in the profession from your 
perspective, both as a practitioner and as an

00:57.568 --> 01:13.676
academician, let's say? Do you see any radical 
changes in development? Or maybe not even

01:19.105 --> 01:20.427
radical, but just Well, I've seen a lot of changes 
since I've been here. I think one of the things as a

01:24.711 --> 01:45.923
practitioner that I see is the intensification of 
pursuit of research, publish or perish, and sort

01:24.711 --> 01:45.923
of getting away from the trend of training for 
practitioners entirely. To me, it seems to

01:45.943 --> 01:49.789
concentrate on selecting a person that has 
propensity for research and practice. They may be

01:55.905 --> 01:57.267
like they used to. They may change their attitude 
after they get to be seniors and graduates. Do you

02:01.234 --> 02:17.700
see the practice changing out in the field such 
that now you're going to set up increasingly the

02:01.234 --> 02:17.700
clinic, the specialized clinic, or the 
specialists, let's say, and then maybe a few

02:01.234 --> 02:17.700
general, fewer general practitioners who feed in 
their clients to the specialists? I guess if

02:17.900 --> 02:22.728
they're sharp enough to get in and graduate from 
college of veterinary medicine, they can

02:17.900 --> 02:22.728
recognize a need. If there's a need somewhere and 
they're not doing too well in a specialty, we're

02:23.369 --> 02:27.837
referral practice only. I think Herman 
Dietrich's a good example of that. We're back to

02:32.344 --> 02:34.668
more of a general practice. Worming and 
inoculations and general health in the patient is

02:35.109 --> 02:40.498
still, in my opinion, a moneymaker. If you've got 
everybody sending you orthopedic cases and you

02:41.052 --> 02:49.766
only do internal fixation orthopedics, you get a 
fabulous fee. Certainly you're going to get

02:50.467 --> 02:54.854
financially

02:50.467 --> 02:54.854
well. This subject's addressed in this last AVMA 
journal. Have you looked at it? No, I just got

02:59.922 --> 03:01.345
yesterday. I think you need to have a copy of it. 
Okay, I'll look at that. It's in regard to analysis

03:05.825 --> 03:11.753
of the Pew report. Good. Veterinary medicine is 
changing in this respect that there's less

03:12.173 --> 03:28.855
attention to the individual animal and more 
concern about herd

03:12.173 --> 03:28.855
health and such as that. I don't accept that 
statement. I think this might be true in food

03:33.398 --> 03:41.550
animal medicine, but food animal medicine is 
becoming less and less a part of veterinary

03:33.398 --> 03:41.550
medicine all the time. Say that again? Food is 
becoming less and less. Okay.

03:49.362 --> 03:55.611
Because it's usually herd health or flock health 
instead of individual animals. The health of that

03:55.691 --> 03:58.956
depends on the diagnosis of the individual 
diseased animal. Okay. So you sit on the fence

04:00.297 --> 04:04.981
looking and throw a hundred head out there and say, 
well, you know, you ought to do this and that.

04:05.001 --> 04:06.102
You've got to still go back. It's treating the 
individual animal that is of interest to the

04:06.282 --> 04:12.989
practicing veterinarian. And that is where the 
money is going to be. It's becoming more like human

04:16.231 --> 04:21.076
health medicine. And instead of departing from 
that picture, it's approaching it more, I think.

04:30.335 --> 04:51.718
the value of the individual animal when you're 
talking about the equine species and the which

04:30.335 --> 04:51.718
involves sentiment and emotion as well but that's 
the pet practice whether it's exotic pets cat and

04:30.335 --> 04:51.718
dog it's sentiment and emotion that causes them to 
spend unlimited sums on these animals Yeah, and

04:52.508 --> 04:55.791
that's one of the big changes, I kind of sense, too. 
It's not an economic decision like it was. I don't

04:58.494 --> 05:06.382
know whether I ought to make this statement or not, 
but it certainly is the basis for a lot of my

04:58.494 --> 05:06.382
feelings and philosophy about veterinary 
medicine. I think that our administrators are a

05:06.482 --> 05:14.291
result of the academic environment more and more. 
Less and less of them have had experience as

05:15.011 --> 05:19.596
practitioners dealing with With people and 
animals in the real world there. I don't know but

05:24.629 --> 05:30.536
what someday we're going to look for our 
administrators to come out of Administrative

05:24.629 --> 05:30.536
training in college. I wouldn't be surprised. Oh, 
yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised, you know

05:32.599 --> 05:34.862
business. Yeah Education is a business It's not 
veterinary medicine That's right and the

05:35.322 --> 05:43.913
business is is getting bucks. How can we get 
research dollars? They don't devise something

05:49.508 --> 05:54.275
that needs to be researched. They don't have the 
objective out there. No, that's right. It's the

05:57.980 --> 06:01.706
bucks. Can we get a quarter of a million dollars, 
and how can we spend it? And of course, that's

06:07.014 --> 06:11.902
typical of the whole world, not just veterinary 
medicine at all. And it is a problem. You know, I'm

06:13.458 --> 06:43.228
not sure this has any relevance to the 
conversation at all, but I have a friend now who

06:13.458 --> 06:43.228
came in yesterday from San Antonio with her little 
whatever the dog is that is 13 years old, fell off a

06:13.458 --> 06:43.228
bed, broke its disc, I guess it was, in the 
vertebra, was paralyzed, brought the dog in for

06:13.458 --> 06:43.228
care, concern, and treatment, and so forth, and 
probably she spent the weekend here We were out of

06:43.630 --> 06:44.471
town. Now she's going to spend four or five more 
days here. I don't know how much money they're

06:46.795 --> 06:57.771
going to spend on that dog, but that is, in my mind, a 
classic example of a new kind of decision

06:46.795 --> 06:57.771
regarding treatment of animals. It's technology 
availability. They now have the ability to have

07:00.074 --> 07:02.618
them. But she has the money to spend on that dog, and 
money is no object. And money was the object. You

07:08.296 --> 07:09.919
just don't do that. That's one of the things that 
Elmo referred to when he brought up about food

07:10.039 --> 07:22.740
animal medicine, that many times they'll come to 
you and you give them an estimate on it, and

07:10.039 --> 07:22.740
economically they'll go over to the sale or 
they'll go to the slaughter plant. That's right.

07:23.341 --> 07:24.403
And you don't get anything. Maybe you get a fee for 
telling them what to do, but there are a lot of those

07:24.423 --> 07:32.436
things that you just price yourself out of the 
market. I could remember a guy having a head for

07:32.416 --> 07:37.266
cesarean for $20. And he said, hell, I ain't going 
to spend that kind of money. He said, no, this shit

07:39.671 --> 07:40.674
refers. I said, well, if you've got two $20 bills in 
your pocket and you lose one, do you take the other

07:41.315 --> 07:47.488
one out and throw it away? You've got a chance to 
recoup some of your funds. There was an old boy who

07:51.192 --> 07:54.135
castrated horses named Pruitt in Fort Worth. And 
he came out and set up an elaborate practice. And he

07:57.339 --> 07:59.421
got $65 for horse castration. Everybody else was 
getting $15. This was in the late 40s, early 50s. He

08:05.267 --> 08:08.191
didn't castrate many horses, but he made plenty of 
money when he did. But there's quite a difference

08:09.132 --> 08:14.117
in establishing fees with individual practices. 
And people, you call them at your clients. I can

08:16.883 --> 08:20.067
remember an old lady drove up to the Cadillac with a 
black cat. She liked for the cat to call the

08:20.848 --> 08:23.511
veterinarian by his first name. And she'd been 
going to somebody and he said, look, I'm better for

08:23.591 --> 08:28.057
that damn cat calling me Joe. And she came to see me. 
There wasn't anything wrong with the cat. She

08:31.902 --> 08:36.748
didn't mind paying $10 for me to rub the cat and tell 
him that this is Uncle Charlie and all that. You

08:36.768 --> 08:37.869
know, we'll have that. It's my estimate of good 
business. Yeah. And you deal with the people. I've

08:42.106 --> 08:43.929
worked with this a lot. The practitioner's out 
there dealing with it. The client is the person,

08:46.073 --> 08:49.320
not the animal, particularly. I can recall a man 
who was in the printing business, named Hodgkins,

08:49.440 --> 08:55.893
had a printing deal there in Arlington. He went in 
the Charolais business, and I went out to Dee Horns

08:55.913 --> 08:59.259
from Gattle for him. He had about, I think it was 
five young bulls there. and he wanted the horns

09:02.613 --> 09:28.080
blocked you know it was routine to just chop those 
suckers off and treat them and i spent

09:02.613 --> 09:28.080
considerable time blocking the corneal nerves 
and cutting them off and an additional figure for

09:02.613 --> 09:28.080
each i don't give a damn what it costs i don't want to 
hurt them yeah so you know you've got the people

09:02.613 --> 09:28.080
that really put them in it's a change and that that 
kind of that part of the world is changing oh yeah

09:02.613 --> 09:28.080
the way you know attitude toward animals, and this 
animal rights thing, and that's going to impact on

09:28.330 --> 09:44.313
you somehow, and I don't know how, or maybe it is 
already, but that's

09:28.330 --> 09:44.313
a strange thing to have to deal with. Well, they're 
radical thinkers. They have some points well

09:47.958 --> 09:52.545
taken, but it's the nuts that are taking the 
points. You can deal with a rational person. and

09:55.786 --> 09:58.891
correct some of those things, which I agree with. 
We've got some things in the livestock industry

09:59.052 --> 10:03.759
and among veterinarians. I want to give you some 
other names here. Okay, good. Thank you. We're

10:07.466 --> 10:08.527
about ready to close it all. I've got a question for 
you. Have you ever been to the Hill College

10:10.992 --> 10:14.678
Confederate exhibit up there? No. I want you to go. 
I promise you. This is run by Colonel Simpson.

10:20.833 --> 10:21.655
Yeah, I know Simpson. Yeah, yeah. You know, I've 
been, my wife and I went by there and it was closed.

10:26.469 --> 10:27.953
So I went the other day.
