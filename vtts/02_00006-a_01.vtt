00:02.005 --> 00:15.406
July 23rd sitting in the nice quiet living room with both the doctor and Mrs. Anderson here at 743 South Rosemary.

00:15.506 --> 00:17.850
Now test your mic and let's be sure it's working.

00:22.837 --> 00:23.879
Just anything brief.

00:25.662 --> 00:30.409
I'm very happy to be involved in this interview process.

00:33.595 --> 00:37.680
Let's begin by asking you to reminisce about family.

00:38.662 --> 00:41.285
Your family got to College Station when?

00:42.267 --> 00:48.855
My father joined the athletic department at A&M in 1920, and he retired in 1957.

00:49.036 --> 01:02.674
My mother was a native of Navasota, and they married, and mother and dad married in 1925, and her life was associated with A&M very much after that.

01:02.654 --> 01:22.654
All right, you shared a few nights ago with us over supper a delight, to me, delightfully interesting description of your father's potential role in how the 12th man myth got to be at A&M.

01:23.393 --> 01:29.041
Would you go back and trace him through that prep school and Mississippi College, please?

01:29.341 --> 01:33.727
My dad was a Tennessean, having grown up in Sparta.

01:34.108 --> 01:37.733
Following high school, he attended a prep school in Shelbyville one year.

01:39.155 --> 01:42.440
And dad was a very good student and a very good athlete.

01:42.680 --> 01:49.249
And his football coach was a young man named DX Bible, who was in his first year of coaching.

01:50.680 --> 01:54.526
The prep school team did very well, winning its league.

01:55.507 --> 02:05.182
And as a consequence of this, DX Bible received the opportunity to go to Mississippi College as the coach of the athletic program.

02:05.783 --> 02:10.090
My dad followed him there, enrolled as a freshman.

02:11.116 --> 02:21.686
The first football game was against the university, what is now Mississippi State University, but at that time was called Mississippi A&M.

02:22.787 --> 02:33.396
And the Mississippi College scored two field goals, and my father scored a 90-yard touchdown.

02:34.657 --> 02:41.123
And as a consequence of that, the Mississippi College was ahead 13 to nothing at the half.

02:41.103 --> 02:51.231
And incidentally, this dad's touchdown was the first scored by a Mississippi College athlete against A&M.

02:52.510 --> 03:04.766
As the third quarter wore on, Mississippi College got to the point that it was having problems sending in replacements for injured athletes.

03:04.966 --> 03:13.337
And during this phase, Mississippi and I got ahead 14 to 13, at which point

03:14.684 --> 03:17.549
Mississippi College ran out of players.

03:18.712 --> 03:21.777
They could only field 10 people.

03:21.797 --> 03:30.634
And the two teams on the field, without consulting the coaches on the sidelines, decided to call the game at that point.

03:30.614 --> 03:33.538
And I've always thought that D.X.

03:33.558 --> 03:47.274
Bible's experience with his first college football game ending that way was probably something that made him prepared to deal with the situation if it ever occurred again.

03:47.295 --> 03:55.845
And as I think many people know that Ed M. played in the Cotton Palace game in the early 1920s in Dallas,

03:55.825 --> 04:02.393
And evidently there were some injuries, and young Ken Gill, a sophomore at that time,

04:02.947 --> 04:14.243
who had not made the traveling squad for the football team, was called out of the stands as a potential replacement, I believe it, in position.

04:14.263 --> 04:22.756
Now, King Gill incidentally became a physician and proposed me to a professional society many years later.

04:25.339 --> 04:32.650
He also, as a freshman, was on my father's freshman football team and freshman basketball team.

04:32.630 --> 04:37.739
Was King Gill big, small?

04:37.759 --> 04:39.582
King Gill was a very large person.

04:39.662 --> 04:40.423
He was tall.

04:41.145 --> 04:47.716
I noticed there's a statue adjacent to the football field showing King Gill, but he was larger than the stature.

04:47.896 --> 04:50.841
He was, I would say, at least six feet.

04:50.821 --> 04:53.685
And his specialty in medicine?

04:53.705 --> 05:01.376
His specialty was eye, ear, nose, and throat, and I think in later years he primarily practiced ophthalmology or eye.

05:02.558 --> 05:03.079
Hometown?

05:03.580 --> 05:04.361
Corpus Christi.

05:04.381 --> 05:04.681
Corpus Christi.

05:04.701 --> 05:05.623
That's where he practiced.

05:05.683 --> 05:06.344
Corpus Christi.

05:07.245 --> 05:14.095
And he, I presume, had very little reputation here as a great athlete.

05:15.661 --> 05:23.910
I think he was more a basketball player than a football player, but I don't think he was all conference or anything of that sort.

05:24.951 --> 05:25.151
All right.

05:25.171 --> 05:27.834
Your dad graduated from Mississippi College.

05:27.874 --> 05:28.135
Yes.

05:28.335 --> 05:42.050
My dad received a bachelor's degree in 1916 from Mississippi College and the next year a master's, an MA in history from Mississippi College.

05:42.070 --> 05:44.132
And it's interesting.

05:44.112 --> 05:48.578
In those years, apparently the eligibility rules were somewhat different from now.

05:49.600 --> 05:57.310
And at that time at Mississippi College, you could play varsity football four years.

05:57.330 --> 06:03.839
And he played three years as an undergraduate student and one year as a graduate student.

06:03.859 --> 06:08.946
And he was a very fine athlete, very quick, and a running back.

06:09.066 --> 06:09.767
He was a running back?

06:09.807 --> 06:11.109
Running back, yes.

06:11.169 --> 06:13.292
Physically, what were his dimensions?

06:13.272 --> 06:22.205
He was five feet seven inches and weighed 140 pounds playing college football.

06:23.166 --> 06:26.931
Coach Bible was his coach all those years at Mississippi College.

06:27.212 --> 06:30.196
Yeah, Coach Bible was Dad's coach the first three years.

06:31.258 --> 06:35.123
The third year, he came to A&M as freshman coach.

06:36.545 --> 06:40.431
The position my dad was brought to a few years later.

06:41.332 --> 06:42.874
Apparently, mid-season,

06:42.854 --> 06:54.807
That year LSU lost its football coach, and so he went over and finished the season as the LSU football coach and then came back to A&M.

06:56.729 --> 06:59.072
And your dad comes over then in what year?

06:59.392 --> 07:01.375
My father came in 1920.

07:02.616 --> 07:04.158
And what were his assignments?

07:04.338 --> 07:11.646
He was the freshman coach of football and basketball.

07:12.385 --> 07:15.592
and assistant track coach.

07:17.396 --> 07:23.750
The athletic department at that time had three members, the ex-bible and Claude Rothgib and my father.

07:24.572 --> 07:25.174
Rothgib?

07:25.434 --> 07:26.236
Yes.

07:26.256 --> 07:27.799
R-O-T-H-G-I-B?

07:28.601 --> 07:29.744
G-E-B, I believe.

07:30.846 --> 07:31.187
G-E-B.

07:31.538 --> 07:37.973
Do you remember any estimate as to what your father's beginning pay was?

07:37.993 --> 07:41.482
I thought, his beginning pay, his beginning salary, did he ever?

07:42.664 --> 07:43.246
I don't know.

07:44.108 --> 07:46.433
I thought that would be an interesting number to be so small.

07:47.516 --> 07:49.260
My father was in the World War II.

07:50.101 --> 08:07.249
one and I think as a captain initially and then as a major and the story and his his income there I think was two hundred dollars a month but I don't know what the NM salary was but but when he was commandant many years later I think his

08:07.229 --> 08:10.135
His total income for the year was $3,500.

08:10.596 --> 08:15.866
This was during the recovery phase from the Depression.

08:16.187 --> 08:20.696
So he comes in 1920, a single young man.

08:20.776 --> 08:21.678
That's correct.

08:21.698 --> 08:22.740
Where did he live?

08:23.902 --> 08:31.318
The first year he lived in the YMCA, where bachelors often lived in those days.

08:31.338 --> 08:41.640
And after that, he and Luther Jones and Tommy Mayo and Ike Ashburn and D.X.

08:42.211 --> 08:50.261
either rented or bought a little house south of College Station close to where the lake used to be in College Park.

08:51.523 --> 08:58.552
And they were roommates there until they had married.

08:58.592 --> 09:00.975
All of those men were single at that point?

09:01.075 --> 09:01.976
All were single, yes.

09:01.996 --> 09:04.219
And all that were on the faculty or staff?

09:04.399 --> 09:05.020
That's correct.

09:05.681 --> 09:09.265
I'm astonished at how much talent there was in that house.

09:09.582 --> 09:14.791
and how important those people became to this school and others.

09:16.534 --> 09:17.316
Let's see.

09:17.336 --> 09:21.043
Did you, you knew DX Bible.

09:21.063 --> 09:21.243
Yes.

09:21.263 --> 09:26.753
Describe him in personality and physical size and so forth.

09:26.893 --> 09:29.017
He was not a large person physically.

09:29.037 --> 09:30.780
He was about to add size.

09:32.161 --> 09:47.588
In fact, Herschel Burgess, who was an athlete on the team, football as well as track team, mentioned many years later when DX was visiting Dad in College Station that he saw a car approaching with no one in it.

09:48.749 --> 10:02.731
And as he got even with the car, he raised up and looked down and their dad and DX were sitting, dad driving and DX in the other seat, pointing out that they were not very tall people.

10:03.992 --> 10:06.977
But DX Bible was actually the son of a

10:08.240 --> 10:12.610
a Greek and Latin professor at Carson Newman College.

10:12.630 --> 10:19.566
And he was a good speaker, somewhat reserved,

10:20.963 --> 10:24.771
in just casual contact.

10:25.553 --> 10:39.361
But a good speaker, my father said he should have been a Baptist minister because he could sway his team emotionally at halftime and other talks.

10:39.381 --> 10:41.706
As the son of a

10:41.686 --> 10:47.912
teacher of those subjects, that may explain how he got that name, Dana Zenitha.

10:47.972 --> 10:49.713
Exactly, yes.

10:49.733 --> 10:50.954
Okay.

10:51.895 --> 10:57.821
And he was the head coach of everything Coach Bible was?

10:57.861 --> 10:58.101
Yes.

10:58.441 --> 11:00.863
Well, he was the athletic director at A&M.

11:01.664 --> 11:03.326
And also at Mississippi College.

11:03.386 --> 11:09.111
But at Mississippi College, the athletic director was the whole department.

11:09.091 --> 11:13.677
Did your dad have any teaching responsibilities in those early years?

11:13.917 --> 11:14.158
Yes.

11:15.039 --> 11:24.090
The athletic department handled the physical education program in the 1920s until 19, well, later than that, but in 1926, W.L.

11:24.451 --> 11:36.246
Penberthy was brought here from Ohio State to set up an independent physical education department, but the coaches still helped with a lot of the classes.

11:36.226 --> 11:49.718
And my father actually, from 1937 until going into the military in 1942, was actually in the physical education department as a professor.

11:49.738 --> 11:54.643
And he taught the first health education courses in that department.

11:54.663 --> 12:06.233
But most of the coach's work was really related more toward tennis or other athletic activities that the students engaged in.

12:06.213 --> 12:15.348
You said they lived first year in the Y. The building that you and I know today was the same building then.

12:15.488 --> 12:16.650
That's correct.

12:17.431 --> 12:21.177
So there was an upstairs or so, some rooms?

12:21.438 --> 12:27.287
I don't know too many floors, but at least there is a second floor above the first.

12:28.349 --> 12:32.676
And that floor, or if there were another one above it, was set aside far up.

12:32.656 --> 12:38.023
rooms for people who had just come to A&M as faculty and staff people.

12:38.884 --> 12:41.947
At that time A&M was, of course, extremely isolated.

12:42.808 --> 12:47.054
There were just a few houses around the campus, off the campus.

12:47.214 --> 12:50.017
And I'm assuming in 1920 he may not have had a car.

12:50.718 --> 12:52.220
Did he have one when he got here?

12:53.982 --> 13:00.570
Yes, I think he did, yes.

13:01.934 --> 13:10.404
By the time I remember very much, mother and dad did have two cars, and they had a 10-year plan with their automobiles.

13:10.524 --> 13:12.727
Mother had the cars the first five years.

13:13.348 --> 13:19.875
Dad had the cars the second five years, which meant that they had hard-duty hunting and that sort of thing.

13:20.476 --> 13:24.121
So that they had a rolling train.

13:25.823 --> 13:28.786
He lived on campus, then moved off.

13:28.806 --> 13:31.249
Did you ever hear him talk about what

13:31.229 --> 13:39.459
those young bachelors did in their free time on a Friday or Saturday night?

13:39.479 --> 13:41.582
What was the social life for a young professional?

13:41.682 --> 13:49.071
You know, I don't know too much about that time after the marriage, though.

13:49.111 --> 13:52.375
I'm more familiar, thanks to my mother's information.

13:52.875 --> 14:00.865
Tell me about how they met and their marriage.

14:02.448 --> 14:10.476
probably three years before they married, and they were put together in the Ike Ashburn wedding.

14:11.437 --> 14:16.822
He married a young lady named Bula from Navasota, who was a friend of my mother.

14:17.282 --> 14:30.295
And so mother and dad were placed together as members of the wedding group and did not immediately go together, but in time began to date.

14:30.275 --> 14:32.618
and married in 1925.

14:33.880 --> 14:40.410
And they lived in the Aggieland Inn the first year of their marriage.

14:40.430 --> 14:53.008
The Aggieland Inn was the predecessor of the MSC as far as on-campus housing, our hotel-type accommodations.

14:52.988 --> 14:56.711
Located near the North Gate, across the street from Cebisa.

14:56.851 --> 14:59.474
That's correct, yeah.

14:59.494 --> 15:15.068
And then, I presume the second year of their marriage, they lived in faculty housing on the block on Houston Street, on the block that the Memorial Student Center is located today.

15:15.969 --> 15:22.995
They lived there until 1935 when Dad became Commandant and Dean of Men.

15:22.975 --> 15:35.053
The faculty housing was arranged so that certain departments or university or college had specific houses in one area.

15:35.073 --> 15:47.091
And so they moved in from an athletic department house to the military area house, which made a move of all of one block down Houston Street, of course.

15:48.133 --> 15:51.598
So when your memory begins,

15:51.578 --> 15:55.003
with living on that block?

15:55.103 --> 15:56.205
Actually, the first block.

15:56.245 --> 15:58.589
I remember that, yeah.

15:58.609 --> 15:59.450
And where were you born?

16:00.312 --> 16:04.017
I was actually born in the first house.

16:05.800 --> 16:10.347
At that time, the college physician, Dr. Marsh, was allowed a small private practice

16:10.327 --> 16:13.311
and he delivered me.

16:15.614 --> 16:29.634
Speaking of the social element, that evening apparently there was a dinner party on campus in one of the houses, faculty houses, and I arrived at 6, 12, or 15, so he was able to attend dinner that evening.

16:30.054 --> 16:37.785
And I might add that social events of that nature were very common on campus in those years.

16:37.765 --> 16:43.432
that flag people entertained their neighbors and their friends and so forth.

16:43.733 --> 16:51.103
Describe, as you recall, in those years, what one of those social events might have involved.

16:51.123 --> 16:55.048
Well, first of all, people dressed for the occasion.

16:55.108 --> 16:57.691
Men wore suits and ladies wore nice dresses.

16:58.052 --> 17:04.380
I'm speaking of the 1930s, but the men wore just regular suits.

17:05.525 --> 17:32.950
You know, there might be some sort of libation before dinner, and then there would be a formal dinner served at the table, and essentially everyone had maids in those years, and so the maid served, and there were several course dinner.

17:32.930 --> 17:37.334
Was it normal for there to be wine served?

17:37.354 --> 17:40.157
Yes, it was, very much, yeah.

17:40.177 --> 17:42.739
There wasn't any unwritten rule about it?

17:43.240 --> 17:44.120
No, there wasn't.

17:44.301 --> 17:59.595
In fact, an interesting story is that during the, to me at least, that during the prohibition, of course, it was very difficult to get alcoholic beverages, and my father actually made beer.

17:59.575 --> 18:06.265
And on one occasion, the bottles got hot and popped.

18:06.285 --> 18:13.396
And Mrs. Summey, who lived next door, Dr. Summey was head of the English department, heard this popping.

18:13.416 --> 18:23.170
And so she came over, knowing what had happened, of course, and started asking Daddy prying questions about what had happened.

18:23.271 --> 18:28.198
And Dad was trying to avoid telling her, but eventually the thief came out.

18:28.178 --> 18:33.615
And the reason she'd come over was she wanted the recipe and the equipment so they could...

18:34.237 --> 18:35.759
They could duplicate that.

18:35.819 --> 18:37.201
Duplicate the process.

18:38.083 --> 18:50.040
Incidentally, Dr. Summey was a Presbyterian seminary son, at least the son of a Presbyterian seminary.

18:50.961 --> 18:51.261
I see.

18:51.382 --> 18:54.406
And your family were Presbyterian.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.692
And I presume that among those

18:59.077 --> 19:05.327
faculty families there living on the same block, there weren't many secrets.

19:05.347 --> 19:05.828
Exactly.

19:05.868 --> 19:10.536
So that perhaps people were aware of what was being brewed.

19:13.962 --> 19:18.469
Who were your family's closest faculty friends in the 30s?

19:19.006 --> 19:24.375
Probably, well, actually, the E. E. McQuillan's very close.

19:24.395 --> 19:31.406
He was actually head of the former Students' Association, and Mother and Mrs. McQuillan, Julia McQuillan, were very good friends.

19:32.267 --> 19:41.242
And then a younger couple who were lifelong friends were the Tom Harringtons, Tom and Ruth Harringtons, very, very close to Mother.

19:41.262 --> 19:43.866
They had just all of their lives,

19:44.133 --> 19:47.460
Let's concentrate on them for a few moments.

19:48.202 --> 19:59.526
I know that he was from Plano because that family, my family from Garland, and there were many important roles that the Harrington family

19:59.506 --> 20:03.874
played in Plano, and I use the word play meaning very, very positive.

20:04.716 --> 20:05.878
Was she also Plano?

20:05.918 --> 20:06.579
I think so.

20:07.721 --> 20:11.368
I think her maiden name was Ruth Norris.

20:11.388 --> 20:15.736
She went to Baylor, and I thought that she was from Dallas.

20:16.177 --> 20:18.882
Okay.

20:18.862 --> 20:26.613
Share any recollections you have of the family's relations with the Harringtons.

20:26.633 --> 20:28.455
Well, they were just extremely good friends.

20:28.595 --> 20:38.329
I know that when I was 11 years old, I shot my first buck.

20:38.509 --> 20:44.177
Dad was a great hunter, so I was initiated into deer hunting at an early age.

20:44.237 --> 20:47.822
And I recall that the evening we returned,

20:47.802 --> 20:53.330
from the hut with the deer, the Harringtons dropped by for just a visit.

20:53.370 --> 20:54.812
This was true of that time.

20:54.852 --> 20:56.395
People just visited me.

20:56.435 --> 21:08.933
It wasn't necessarily a formal thing, but they came by and I have a photo showing me holding their little boy John, who was an infant at that time, with my deer.

21:08.913 --> 21:12.918
And John became an ophthalmologist just as I have been.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.660
Where did you kill the deer?

21:14.740 --> 21:15.881
Where?

21:16.802 --> 21:23.430
It was at the Grody, G-R-O-T-E, ranch near Johnson City.

21:24.711 --> 21:28.035
Old Dr. Walton, the president, loved to hunt too.

21:28.115 --> 21:38.667
And Dad and he and a number of people from A&M were members of that deer lease, Dr. Marsh.

21:38.647 --> 21:46.117
Because there was no... Mr. Hoyle and Mr. Chatham who headed the exchange store and other people.

21:46.278 --> 21:48.180
There were no deer around here in those days.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.522
In those years there were no deer here.

21:49.542 --> 21:50.804
That's what I thought.

21:51.625 --> 22:03.321
The campus routine then were classes for six days a week so that there were six work days and then

22:03.301 --> 22:09.761
until Saturday noon and then Saturday afternoon would have been non-scheduled and Sunday.

22:10.403 --> 22:16.602
Your family, when did the Presbyterian Church at the North Gate begin to get organized?

22:17.088 --> 22:30.949
The Presbyterian Church in Northgate, well actually the church itself was organized in the 1920s, and it met in the chapel of the YMCA building.

22:31.330 --> 22:33.072
I can remember going there.

22:35.576 --> 22:37.459
Who were some of the regular members?

22:37.439 --> 22:42.393
the D.W.

22:42.413 --> 22:52.461
Williams were, the Boltons, the Marshes,

22:52.441 --> 22:55.306
I'm thinking back to those earlier years at this point.

22:58.051 --> 22:58.572
Cassians?

22:58.812 --> 23:01.437
Cassians, yes, very much.

23:01.457 --> 23:08.830
Of course, Mr. Cassians headed the YMCA, and the Lancasters also were very active.

23:08.810 --> 23:13.937
Carolyn Mitchell was my Sunday school superintendent, and the Mitchells too.

23:14.398 --> 23:23.209
And it was a group of people who had major roles in university in many cases.

23:23.229 --> 23:26.153
So you all met on the campus for many years.

23:27.495 --> 23:37.028
And we, incidentally, our Sunday school class was in the bottom of the assembly hall.

23:37.008 --> 23:45.402
We were talking about the church and it being on campus and then getting organized off campus.

23:45.923 --> 23:46.463
That's correct.

23:47.245 --> 23:59.725
The first building that the church had was its present location, and it was an army chapel that had been

23:59.705 --> 24:12.284
the building itself was an army chapel to which in about 1950 or 51 or two, a rather extensive educational and fellowship hall component was headed adjacent to it.

24:12.305 --> 24:13.887
Do you remember where the chapel came from?

24:13.947 --> 24:14.708
Which army base?

24:14.728 --> 24:17.292
I don't know which base, no.

24:17.312 --> 24:20.397
Now I might mention that apparently

24:21.710 --> 24:45.593
In the early 1940s, the YMCA chapel was not available, and so for a few years, the church met in the Campus Theater, which was a rather large auditorium, you might call it, with a large seating capacity.

24:45.733 --> 24:47.295
Is it Gallium?

24:47.275 --> 24:49.278
No, this was the campus theater.

24:49.299 --> 24:49.759
Oh, the campus.

24:49.839 --> 24:50.941
Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry.

24:50.961 --> 24:52.143
The campus theater at the North Gate, yes.

24:52.244 --> 24:53.326
At the North Gate, yes.

24:53.887 --> 24:56.331
And which is intended to dwarf our congregation.

24:57.813 --> 25:01.119
The army chapel was more appropriate in size.

25:01.279 --> 25:01.480
All right.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.343
There were Sunday school classes.

25:03.509 --> 25:04.491
Yes.

25:04.511 --> 25:06.775
And Sunday morning, preaching?

25:06.815 --> 25:20.461
The Sunday school classes, incidentally, going back to my earliest memories on campus, the first Sunday school classes were held in the basement area at the back of the Guyon Hall.

25:21.503 --> 25:26.192
And I thought this was simply a Presbyterian group, but it was apparently

25:26.172 --> 25:47.235
a unified or composite Sunday school class, and then the first Presbyterian Sunday school classes then apparently were held or evidently held in the basement of the assembly hall, which was a wood structure where the chapel now stands.

25:47.215 --> 25:50.860
You mentioned Caroline Mitchell, who recently died.

25:52.182 --> 25:54.445
Describe her as a young woman.

25:55.467 --> 26:08.365
Caroline was a person with an interesting sense of humor, I always thought, and a positive person.

26:09.146 --> 26:15.855
She had had, I guess you'd say, a number of early tragedies.

26:15.835 --> 26:26.128
engaged, as I recall, to a young man who was killed in military service, possibly in an airplane crash.

26:26.268 --> 26:30.473
And then, apparently, essentially the same thing happened again.

26:30.493 --> 26:34.057
And so she had two engagements, but was never married.

26:34.198 --> 26:44.290
And her father was a professor of mathematics, as I recall, at least on the faculty.

26:45.620 --> 27:02.981
She taught high school during part of the early 1940s at Consolidated and then for many years was a staff member in the registrar's office.

27:03.842 --> 27:08.748
Now, I remember her in that role as a very strong-willed woman.

27:08.768 --> 27:09.349
Yes.

27:09.329 --> 27:17.000
that her answer was very definitely yes or very definitely no, and there was not much chance of changing her mind.

27:17.821 --> 27:24.191
Yes, and I think her sense of humor sometimes took sort of devious turns.

27:24.231 --> 27:36.008
My dad said that when dealing with some of his athletes' academic records that she was very much a stickler for things being exactly so.

27:37.390 --> 27:39.032
Back to the church.

27:39.670 --> 27:44.821
Who was the, when the congregation was meeting on campus, who was the minister?

27:45.543 --> 27:50.994
Well, Norman Anderson was the minister throughout my memory.

27:52.979 --> 27:55.063
There was someone before him.

27:55.330 --> 27:59.879
sort of in the timeframe of about 1925.

27:59.899 --> 28:07.794
And Norman Anderson was there by the time I was baptized in 1930.

28:07.974 --> 28:15.448
I was born in 1928.

28:16.947 --> 28:20.272
And incidentally, I received a little New Testament.

28:21.373 --> 28:30.066
I was given one at that time, a very small one, and it said something about becoming a fisher of men.

28:30.086 --> 28:34.192
And I took that with me when I went to Zaire and worked in a Presbyterian hospital.

28:34.312 --> 28:34.933
How good.

28:35.053 --> 28:35.754
How good.

28:37.236 --> 28:39.059
Were you given that at baptism time?

28:39.219 --> 28:43.465
I was given one like that when I finished my primary.

28:45.288 --> 28:46.650
I was.

28:48.250 --> 28:57.302
Two years old, plus or minus.

28:57.322 --> 29:00.165
Were there any other congregations that met on campus?

29:01.287 --> 29:02.248
Not to my knowledge.

29:04.972 --> 29:17.768
My earliest recollection is that the Baptists and the Methodists and the Church of Christ people had their separate

29:18.254 --> 29:21.620
Sanctuaries North, in College State North.

29:21.840 --> 29:22.862
Already at Northgate.

29:23.523 --> 29:24.445
Catholic also?

29:24.905 --> 29:25.887
And Catholic also.

29:25.927 --> 29:33.500
In fact, that probably was the oldest of the ones, yeah.

29:33.520 --> 29:37.647
Let's now talk about being a little boy on the campus.

29:37.667 --> 29:40.051
You start the first grade what year, where?

29:41.093 --> 29:42.996
I started the first grade

29:44.680 --> 29:56.954
I guess in 1935, in a building called the Music Hall, which was three blocks from our house.

29:56.974 --> 30:07.245
It was so interesting that I was born one block from where I received my college diploma and three blocks from where I attended the first grade.

30:07.225 --> 30:13.175
But Mrs. Simons was my teacher, and she later was my patient when I entered practice here.

30:13.195 --> 30:13.656
Simon?

30:13.956 --> 30:19.626
Simons, S-A-M-M-O-N-S.

30:19.946 --> 30:24.694
Her husband died, and she later became Mrs. Robert Lyle.

30:24.674 --> 30:27.378
Very pleasant, nice person.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.062
How many in that first grade?

30:30.543 --> 30:30.623
Hmm?

30:30.643 --> 30:32.025
How many in that first grade?

30:32.045 --> 30:37.933
There probably were about 22 or three of us.

30:37.953 --> 30:43.982
And incidentally, nearly all of us were together when we graduated from high school.

30:43.962 --> 30:51.493
It was an environment where there was not a lot of change of people at the faculty and staff level.

30:52.114 --> 30:54.217
Everyone stayed for their careers.

30:54.578 --> 30:57.602
And these were almost all campus youngsters?

30:57.622 --> 30:59.185
Yes.

30:59.445 --> 30:59.786
Was it?

30:59.846 --> 31:08.659
Probably three-fourths were campus youngsters and maybe six or seven from out of town.

31:08.679 --> 31:11.383
Was it already named A&M Consolidated School?

31:11.423 --> 31:12.805
Yes, it was.

31:12.785 --> 31:23.182
It may have had a different name when it started, but the reason it was called Consolidated was that several little smaller entities were brought together.

31:26.568 --> 31:32.377
Mr. Dr. Wilcox was instrumental in developing the school.

31:32.397 --> 31:38.387
He was head of the education department at A&M, and his daughter, Joanna, was my classmate.

31:38.367 --> 31:46.032
Do you have any idea about when the Indian Consolidated School started?
