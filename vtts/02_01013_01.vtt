00:01.685 --> 00:05.009
1988 at Bryan High concerning the Vietnam War. In 
the interest of accumulating knowledge about the

00:06.351 --> 00:11.717
war, I'm going to donate this tape to the A&M Oral 
History Collection. Is that okay with you, Mr.

00:12.859 --> 00:13.960
Price? Yes. Okay. Could you please tell us when and 
where you were born? I was born in Abilene, Texas in

00:20.268 --> 00:22.130
1939. Okay. Where did you go to high school and 
college? I went to high school at a little place

00:27.557 --> 00:31.422
called Hawley. And my college is at Texas A&M 
University. I have two degrees from there. Okay,

00:38.796 --> 00:40.138
what are those degrees in? I have a Bachelor of 
Science in Industrial Education, a Master of

00:40.158 --> 00:49.769
Science in Industrial Education, and currently 
working on a PhD in Educational Administration.

00:49.789 --> 00:53.714
Okay, when and where and why exactly did you join 
the military? I joined the military in 1957, about

00:55.195 --> 01:00.902
three months after I graduated from high school. 
crime cause. At the time, it was sort of impossible

01:03.930 --> 01:07.533
to go to college. That was an alternative open to 
me. I took it and just stayed in. Made a career of it.

01:14.779 --> 01:17.141
Had your father or any of your brothers been in the 
military? To my knowledge, I was the first. Okay.

01:22.466 --> 01:26.029
Could you please give us a brief sketch of your 
military career before Vietnam? Before Vietnam,

01:27.310 --> 01:30.973
I had spent approximately 15 years in the 
military, various places around the world,

01:32.624 --> 01:42.214
mostly in overseas areas in the Far East. Five 
years in Central and South America. The main drill

01:46.939 --> 01:49.062
is pretty much in the Far East. I got into Europe for 
about six months on a TDY mission one time, but it

01:50.263 --> 01:55.929
never really went that way. What was the TDY 
mission? We went over on a major operation and we

01:58.932 --> 02:03.316
were there for approximately six months. We took a 
division over with maneuvers and stayed about six

02:03.396 --> 02:08.861
months and came back. Okay. Upon going to Vietnam, 
how much did you know and how much had the military

02:10.943 --> 02:20.572
taught you about Vietnam, say, their culture and 
Buddhism and geography, et cetera? Prior to going

02:20.592 --> 02:28.720
over, I went to Fort Bragg, North Carolina for a 
period of 60 days. at which time we were given

02:29.948 --> 02:43.973
refresher courses on weapons that were primarily 
World War II and Korean War vintage that we hadn't

02:29.948 --> 02:43.973
been using to bring us back into contact with them. 
Some older communications equipment we had.

02:46.978 --> 02:54.471
During that period of time, we had four hours of 
Vietnamese language training every day. some

02:55.008 --> 03:08.280
general background classes on the political 
aspects of Vietnam at the time, and as much of an

02:55.008 --> 03:08.280
update on the military situation as possible. And 
to some extent, we had some cultural

03:09.721 --> 03:23.833
indoctrination in that our language teachers 
were all Vietnamese, and had just recently come

03:09.721 --> 03:23.833
from Vietnam, so we were acquiring something of a 
cultural aspect also. So you were able to

03:24.067 --> 03:26.270
communicate pretty well? I never really found 
out. I got a few opportunities to speak, but mostly

03:30.035 --> 03:48.019
my counterparts were Arvin officers, and they 
seemed to have one goal in mind at the time, to learn

03:30.035 --> 03:48.019
to speak English well enough that they could go to 
an offshore school, which meant come to the States

03:30.035 --> 03:48.019
and attend school here. If they couldn't speak 
English, proficiently, they would never get the

03:50.257 --> 03:54.921
opportunity to attend one of those schools. When I 
dealt with them, I had to speak in English, but they

03:54.941 --> 04:00.807
would talk Vietnamese with me. I never dealt too 
awfully much with the enlisted. I didn't really

04:03.970 --> 04:07.233
have a counterpart on the enlisted side. For some 
reason, in their military, the enlisted, even the

04:09.154 --> 04:15.761
NCOs, weren't given that much latitude or 
authority. So if I wanted something done, I dealt

04:15.941 --> 04:19.504
with an officer, and that made some problems, and 
because of this cultural thing they had, sort of a

04:20.092 --> 04:25.017
case system within the Army. They didn't really 
want to deal with me, but they had to. I spoke

04:30.723 --> 04:38.851
Vietnamese to the villagers when they would talk 
to me, but that was a matter of if there were no Arvin

04:30.723 --> 04:38.851
around, they would talk to me. If the Arvin were 
there, they would not talk to me. Probably didn't

04:44.557 --> 04:47.660
get to practice my language very much then. Did you 
feel any resentment as How the officers treated

04:49.927 --> 04:54.012
you like that? No. I accepted it as their system. I 
thought it was rather foolish not to take

04:57.616 --> 05:03.202
advantage of the NCOs like any other army does. 
Realistically, the officers can't run the army.

05:08.408 --> 05:11.151
There's an old saying in our army, the NCO is the 
backbone of the army. You take the NCO away, you

05:11.171 --> 05:13.533
don't really have an army. The officers can't do 
it. They have too many other things. It was rather

05:17.138 --> 05:19.360
apparent in the army that the officers trying to do 
everything themselves, not letting the NCOs have

05:20.048 --> 05:28.039
the responsibility they should, but things got 
bogged down considerably. Um, did you, were you in

05:30.121 --> 05:42.218
your unit, did you have a clear overall picture of 
what exactly what America was trying to

05:30.121 --> 05:42.218
accomplish there, or were you just sort of part of 
the big picture? Well, within our province, I had a

05:46.137 --> 05:53.427
pretty firm view of where we were headed since I 
worked at both the province level and the district

05:46.137 --> 05:53.427
level. I started at the district level, but we were 
pretty well indoctrinated in country as to what

05:53.487 --> 06:01.337
our goals were at the district level. And about 
halfway through my first tour, I moved up to the

06:02.940 --> 06:15.216
province level working with the operations and 
intelligence and with the civilian side of the

06:02.940 --> 06:15.216
house also. At that point, we were pretty well 
indoctrinated about what the whole concept was

06:15.736 --> 06:23.388
for the province and the country. So I had a 
realistic view of where we were supposed to be

06:23.528 --> 06:28.656
going with it. And that was pacification and 
reinserting the people back into lands that they

06:28.676 --> 06:43.920
had given up to the BC previously, which was 
primarily what we were trying to do, just regain

06:28.676 --> 06:43.920
the land and get rid of the BC. or reduce the VC to a 
level that the locals could manage without a great

06:44.221 --> 06:52.893
deal of military. Could you give us just an example 
of what your unit would typically do in terms of

06:52.913 --> 07:00.284
pacification?

07:00.304 --> 07:08.956
Our program of pacification, when I first 
arrived, was one of simply trying to regain land.

07:10.058 --> 07:13.823
At that point, this was shortly after Tet, 1968, My 
province, probably one of the worst in the whole of

07:14.933 --> 07:24.703
Vietnam, the birthplace of the VC movement. So 
they were pretty well entrenched. After Tet in

07:29.248 --> 07:33.633
1968, they were very weakened because of the loss 
of manpower. And we were expanding back out into

07:33.653 --> 07:38.958
areas that the government forces had withdrawn 
out of. So we were, at that point in time, simply in

07:38.978 --> 07:43.523
the process of establishing fortified outposts 
out into an area and sort of a circular effect. We'd

07:51.651 --> 07:57.679
move them further out to try and gain back control 
of that area. Sort of the inkblot. Yeah, so kind of

07:58.340 --> 08:00.623
like an inkblot, like a ripple. You throw stone in 
the water, you get ripples. That's what we were

08:03.046 --> 08:04.187
doing. We were expanding out from the district 
capital, trying to get control of the property

08:04.207 --> 08:11.056
back that we had given up at some previous time. And 
we were pretty effective during that period. We

08:18.806 --> 08:22.451
lost a little bit, but we eventually worked it 
back. And then I went back a year later for a second

08:23.892 --> 08:28.018
tour. I went back to the same place, and I could see 
what we had done in two years' time. Had it

08:36.249 --> 08:37.190
improved? Oh, considerably. We were considered 
one of our district's The one that the VC movement

08:43.021 --> 08:47.425
was born in, we had taken it back almost 100%. It was 
turned into what they would call a showcase of

08:47.666 --> 08:51.750
South Vietnam. We had officials from all over the 
country coming to see what we had done and how we had

08:51.790 --> 08:56.395
done it. So we were successful within our province 
and the one across the river, Gokong Province,

08:56.415 --> 09:04.843
which was also very heavily infested. They were 
successful enough with their program also that

09:04.883 --> 09:09.568
between the two, provinces, we had got it fairly 
well pacified. We didn't have a great deal of VC

09:13.637 --> 09:17.260
activity when I left there on my second tour. Was 
there, you say not a great deal, was there any VC

09:17.601 --> 09:22.565
activity at night that you didn't see during the 
daytime? Oh, there were sporadic raids and

09:23.707 --> 09:35.979
occasional mortaring, but we didn't really 
experience a great deal of heavy encounters.

09:35.999 --> 09:37.480
Occasionally, there'd be a transiting hardcore 
unit that somebody might stumble across and have

09:38.118 --> 09:42.183
contact with. We didn't really have any major 
hardcore units after 1968. They were pretty much

09:48.031 --> 09:49.353
eliminated. In fact, all the hardcore units had 
been moved up to higher levels. The battalions had

09:54.600 --> 10:01.169
been pulled out and sent up to attack Corps 
headquarters in Saigon, places like that. The

10:01.329 --> 10:04.653
companies had been pulled up to higher levels. 
Practically all of our hardcore regular units had

10:08.628 --> 10:12.792
been eliminated because they had been taken out 
and used and attacked somewhere else. All we had

10:12.832 --> 10:15.835
left was a few stragglers and they were trying to 
rebuild. They weren't very successful after Tet.

10:20.440 --> 10:25.124
What was your opinion of, or is your opinion of, the 
effectiveness of pacification overall? Because

10:25.284 --> 10:26.846
it was a lot of programs.

10:30.089 --> 10:31.731
That's kind of a hard one. It depends on where you 
were as to what pacification meant. Wasn't

10:34.754 --> 10:38.297
Project Phoenix also considered pacification? 
Was it not pacification? I guess it would be

10:40.936 --> 10:51.316
considered part of the pacification program in 
that they were trying to eliminate the VC Cadry,

10:40.936 --> 10:51.316
the infrastructure out in the field. To that 
extent, it probably was part of the pacification,

10:51.857 --> 10:58.450
but we didn't really consider it part of our 
pacification program. We had no control over it.

11:01.953 --> 11:04.759
It was primarily controlled by people in Saigon. 
We had people in our province who were working in

11:04.799 --> 11:10.130
the program, but we had no say over what they did or 
didn't do. So we didn't really consider them part

11:11.253 --> 11:13.277
of our program. In the big picture, yes, they were 
trying to eliminate the infrastructure, so I

11:14.780 --> 11:22.797
suppose that's pacification to that way of 
thinking. It varied from province to province.

11:25.675 --> 11:28.859
The people in the northern provinces were working 
at it slightly different than we were. They relied

11:28.880 --> 11:39.856
much, much more heavily on the military to pass by 
regular army units because up there they were

11:28.880 --> 11:39.856
dealing with a different type situation. The 
number of hardcore units and North Vietnamese

11:41.278 --> 11:49.590
units made it almost impossible for the locals to 
deal with it at the level we were dealing with. And

11:50.131 --> 11:51.653
our people were primarily the regional force, 
popular force, platoons and companies. They're

11:56.257 --> 12:04.909
not very well trained and not very well armed, just 
locals trying to protect their home, which

11:56.257 --> 12:04.909
wouldn't work in, say, I Corps or II Corps up north. 
We'd be constantly looking at NVA battalions and

12:04.989 --> 12:08.394
larger. Did you and your unit ever experience any 
actual combat with North Vietnam troops or the

12:10.537 --> 12:16.084
Viet Cong? So far as we know, There were never any 
NVA in our area. We don't know of any. There were

12:25.167 --> 12:28.350
rumors at one or two times that there were some 
Chinese advisors. And at one point someone even

12:30.733 --> 12:38.160
started a rumor about a Russian advisory 
possibly, but that didn't get off the ground too

12:30.733 --> 12:38.160
much. But the Chinese advisory rumor floated a 
little bit. We never found anything to

12:42.264 --> 12:44.205
substantiate it. We could never get any 
sightings. As far as we know, it was purely . The

12:48.686 --> 13:00.260
only thing we were dealing with was VC and local VC 
at that, just I guess on the level of the militia VC

12:48.686 --> 13:00.260
and occasional hardcore unit that would come 
through. But no NVA to our knowledge. One problem

13:04.745 --> 13:12.614
that seems to be picked up a lot in literature and 
movies now is drugs in Vietnam and such. Did you

13:12.674 --> 13:14.897
ever experience any trouble with drugs?

13:17.628 --> 13:22.756
We had, to my knowledge, in the two years there, 
only one incident with drugs. And these people

13:23.957 --> 13:31.829
were from an aviation battalion who had been

13:23.957 --> 13:31.829
put with us. And the only thing we had were two 
pilots and a couple of crew chiefs to keep their

13:33.552 --> 13:41.263
light observation aircraft flying out of our 
airfield. They were found with marijuana. So it

13:45.623 --> 13:47.705
wasn't that bad of a problem for them. They were 
just using marijuana, nothing in the way of hard

13:47.725 --> 13:52.389
drugs or anything. To my knowledge, they were the 
only ones. They weren't in the same category as the

13:55.272 --> 13:59.636
rest of us. The rest of us were advisors who 
belonged to MACV. Those people were out of a

14:03.019 --> 14:09.144
regular American aviation unit and assigned to us 
for assistance. So the type of personnel is

14:09.164 --> 14:13.048
slightly different. If you understand, the 
American units probably had a lower caliber of

14:14.665 --> 14:26.799
people than the advisors did, because all the 
advisors were officers, high-ranking

14:14.665 --> 14:26.799
non-commissioned officers. We had a few of the 
lower enlisted, but they were few and far between.

14:33.967 --> 14:36.370
So you didn't really come into contact with many 
enlisted men? On a large scale? Not below the rank

14:37.779 --> 14:41.364
of E-5, no. The E-4 and the privates, PFCs, we 
didn't really, there was no place for them. We had

14:47.451 --> 14:52.878
no place in our table of organization for those 
people to be there. Everything we had called for an

14:54.120 --> 14:59.246
NCO or an officer, so they were at least E-5 and up. 
Occasionally we would get an E-4 in as a radio

14:59.727 --> 15:04.112
operator, but that was about the extent of it. 
Okay, another popular saying among the, I don't

15:05.358 --> 15:14.566
know, among the officers, but about some 
officers, that they just were concerned about

15:05.358 --> 15:14.566
getting their ticket punched. Did your unit 
experience any trouble with, you know,

15:14.586 --> 15:23.294
career-hungry officers or people that just 
wanted to advance themselves? Was that

15:23.314 --> 15:25.516
counterproductive at all? To a point, perhaps. 
But you have to understand that that ticket

15:29.139 --> 15:33.863
punching thing didn't apply to People in the 
advisory, they didn't have the same opportunity

15:34.957 --> 15:42.626
for command that people in the regular units. An 
officer would come to Vietnam if he went to a normal

15:43.287 --> 15:46.150
unit. He was expected to go up on the front and 
command a platoon, or a company, or a battalion, or

15:46.170 --> 15:53.579
whatever, depending on what was ranked, to get his 
command time. There really was no equivalency of a

15:53.599 --> 16:00.047
command in the advisory effort. For instance, an 
advisory team at district was made up of a major, a

16:00.968 --> 16:04.592
captain, One sergeant first class, a staff 
sergeant for a medic, an E-5 for a radio operator.

16:10.478 --> 16:11.701
That's not much of a command. You don't command 
anybody. So what was happening in Arvin is, or in

16:13.865 --> 16:23.543
the advisory effort, is that they would be given 
credit for command time for one year to it. So they

16:23.759 --> 16:25.702
would get credit for command time. So there wasn't 
any of this trying to find a job where you could lead

16:25.743 --> 16:30.150
troops in combat. If you were there as an advisor, 
after one year you were given the prerequisite

16:30.251 --> 16:39.928
command time that every officer wanted to have on 
his record when he left there. When they came into

16:40.364 --> 16:43.068
the advisory effort, they were assigned a job. 
They stayed with that job for the whole year. There

16:45.252 --> 16:54.967
was no shifting around, so we didn't have that much 
of a problem in terms of rapid turnover of leaders

16:45.252 --> 16:54.967
and inconsistency and incontinuity of command. 
You were there for a year. You did your year at that

16:56.369 --> 17:00.616
job, and you were home. That short period caused 
continuity to break off, but still, it wasn't that

17:03.213 --> 17:12.888
difficult to come in and pick up an advisory job if 
you'd been given any training at all before you got

17:03.213 --> 17:12.888
there. The establishing of relationships was 
probably the biggest thing you had to go through,

17:14.030 --> 17:24.546
and that probably took about 90 days before you 
really established any rapport with your

17:14.030 --> 17:24.546
counterpart. productivity didn't fall off much 
or anything, because very seldom you'd ever lose

17:25.690 --> 17:31.457
the entire team at one time. It'd be an individual 
at times, so the incoming person didn't really

17:31.477 --> 17:37.804
fall into a hole, so to speak. There were people 
there who were already in place and functioning,

17:37.844 --> 17:45.153
so they could support the effort until he got 
himself, you know, got his feet wet and ready to go.

17:46.614 --> 17:52.221
So we didn't face the same problems that a regular 
unit would face with that type of changeover. Do

17:53.939 --> 17:59.646
you feel that overall the war could have been 
better fought had there not been a one-year tour of

17:53.939 --> 17:59.646
duty? Had there been, you know, an unlimited tour, 
say, or something like in World War II? I'm sure it

18:05.614 --> 18:10.380
probably could have, just from the experience 
factor alone. By the time you got a good

18:10.901 --> 18:18.550
understanding of how the war was supposed to be 
fought, it was time to go home. Maybe your

18:18.570 --> 18:23.136
replacement came in who had been there, and he was 
coming back for seconds, and he knew what to do. If

18:23.723 --> 18:27.488
he was a first-timer, then he had to go through the 
learning process. And there's not really much you

18:27.608 --> 18:32.856
can tell an individual about how you're going to 
work in combat. I mean, you have the basic idea to

18:33.196 --> 18:38.283
have the correct training, the tactics, the 
theory, and everything. But the actual situation

18:39.865 --> 18:45.293
is oftentimes far removed from what the training 
was. You had at least a background to work with, and

18:47.015 --> 18:50.760
you had to adapt. to what the situation was, and 
that created the problem with the short tour. So I

18:56.982 --> 19:05.370
would say, yes, probably could have been done 
better if everybody had stayed there, as in World

18:56.982 --> 19:05.370
War II, duration plus five.

19:08.212 --> 19:15.879
Then we would have had people there who were 
constantly doing the job that they were trying to

19:08.212 --> 19:15.879
do, if they learned what they were supposed to do. I 
kind of look at the French.

19:20.980 --> 19:23.144
They kept their people there almost constantly. 
There was no rotation in and out for those people,

19:23.184 --> 19:32.803
but from the looks of what happened to them and many 
of the history lessons that I've looked up, it's

19:23.184 --> 19:32.803
how the French fought. They didn't learn much. 
They were fighting, trying to fight a

19:34.526 --> 19:37.572
conventional similar to what they fought in World 
War II that wasn't working for them. And they got

19:42.786 --> 19:47.072
away from that and went into the enclave theory, 
the fortified outposts and what have you. That

19:47.092 --> 19:53.101
didn't work either because it turned the whole 
countryside over to the Viet Minh at the time. So if

19:53.121 --> 20:01.374
they learned something and conducted the war in a 
fashion that you could counter what the enemy did,

19:53.121 --> 20:01.374
then yes, it would have been productive to keep 
everybody there. Because then you would have

20:01.734 --> 20:05.500
people who knew what to do, constantly. Do you feel 
that the U.S. should have learned or could have

20:05.682 --> 20:14.865
learned a lesson from the French and the Viet Minh 
and apply that to the Viet Cong in terms of

20:05.682 --> 20:14.865
conventional warfare? We couldn't have learned 
anything from the French. We were using some of the

20:17.933 --> 20:20.620
French tactics. And it turns out it didn't work for 
them. It didn't work for us either. We were doing

20:24.844 --> 20:27.146
some of the very same things that the French did. In 
fact, almost everything the French did, we were

20:28.207 --> 20:35.394
doing, except the very large, large outposts like 
Dien Bien Phu and a few places like that. We had

20:35.414 --> 20:43.442
large fire bases and everything, but we never 
settled down in one place that long, so we differed

20:35.414 --> 20:43.442
from the French in that respect. But we were doing a 
lot of the things the French did in every aspect of

20:43.462 --> 20:48.447
it. It turned out it didn't work for us either 
because we couldn't control the land. There's an

20:54.392 --> 20:59.920
old saying in combat, or if you don't control the 
other guy's property, then you can't win. So we

21:01.222 --> 21:06.189
never were sure that we controlled anything other 
than what we were physically standing on top of at

21:01.222 --> 21:06.189
the time. You go into an area, you supposedly clear 
that area, and then we leave. Five hours after we

21:15.848 --> 21:17.771
leave, the VC are back. That's one of their base 
areas, and they go right back into it. They sort of

21:21.396 --> 21:24.922
go with the flow, so to speak. They pull away if 
we're too strong. If we're not strong enough, they

21:27.746 --> 21:40.265
might give it a shot, see if they can do something to 
us, but very seldom did they ever try to hit us face

21:27.746 --> 21:40.265
on unless they had at least a 3-1 superiority on us. 
Other than that, it was just a little hit and run,

21:40.285 --> 21:43.510
disappear into the brush. Did your unit ever leave 
the land it had reoccupied with the South

21:44.772 --> 21:53.444
Vietnamese, and if so, did the VC move back in? In my 
tours and in between the tours, the land that we had

21:55.627 --> 22:06.922
moved back in and occupied or put out on some was 
still under our control when I left at the end of the

21:55.627 --> 22:06.922
third year. We were still there, pretty well 
entrenched, and the people were coming back to the

22:07.002 --> 22:13.210
land Some had never left, of course, but a few that 
did were moving back out. We were expanding out

22:19.200 --> 22:21.422
beyond those ranges anyway. So as far as I can see, 
we never lost any ground after 68-12.

22:29.110 --> 22:34.335
Do you feel that, though, if your unit had pulled 
out in the foreseeable future, would the Viet Cong

22:29.110 --> 22:34.335
have come back? Well, if we're speaking of the 
advisors, I don't think so, because we weren't

22:40.358 --> 22:43.521
doing any fighting. Five guys out there in the 
middle of nowhere can't. Realistically, we

22:46.785 --> 22:48.827
weren't a combat force. We were there just to tell 
other people. But they were reaching a point where

22:50.869 --> 22:55.934
they could do fairly well on their own. A good 
example, the advisory effort was starting to wind

22:56.395 --> 23:01.140
down before I left here. And they were pulling 
people out of the Arvin units. So at the time I left,

23:05.764 --> 23:08.307
all of the advisors at the company level and the 
battalion levels had been removed. And the only

23:13.806 --> 23:18.410
people left still advising were at regiments and 
division headquarters level. And that was only

23:18.811 --> 23:20.172
two or three people. And as best we could tell, 
those units that were working in and around our

23:21.333 --> 23:30.262
areas were doing a better job than they had when the 
advisors were there. Because they had to do the job

23:31.644 --> 23:34.767
then. With the advisors on hand, a lot of the things 
that the Arvins should have been doing, the

23:35.101 --> 23:41.850
advisors were doing. In a sense, the people who 
worked with the Arvin were their own worst

23:41.870 --> 23:45.014
enemies. They weren't letting the Arvin do the job 
when it should have been done. The old American, go

23:50.200 --> 23:56.328
get them, we've got to do it now, hurry up, sort of 
got in the way. The Vietnamese didn't work in that

23:56.368 --> 23:59.051
fashion. They were playing at it very slowly. If it 
took five days to do something, then that's the way

24:01.139 --> 24:05.065
they went at it. But the Americans didn't want to 
work that slow. You start an operation, you want to

24:06.928 --> 24:10.493
get it bang, bang, bang, get it done. And they would 
short circuit the Vietnamese just to get things

24:11.315 --> 24:22.812
moving faster, and it took away, to me, some of the 
initiative that the Vietnamese should have had

24:11.315 --> 24:22.812
and weren't showing because they knew the 
Americans were going to do it for them. And when

24:22.832 --> 24:27.940
those people left, those divisions appeared to be 
working better than they were when they had the

24:28.207 --> 24:31.031
Americans down to company levels. Do you feel that 
careerism and officer advancement was a problem

24:33.095 --> 24:41.848
in Arvin, and did that, and corruption possibly, 
did that affect the way they fought?

24:45.133 --> 24:46.655
I would think probably it had to. Several 
instances come to mind. One, we had some

24:53.300 --> 25:00.634
Candidates for officers and candidates for 
warrant officer, we were trying to get promoted

24:53.300 --> 25:00.634
locally, and we couldn't do it. They would make 
them acting officers, but the best we could find

25:00.654 --> 25:11.275
out is they didn't belong to the right family or 
they didn't have the proper connections to be

25:00.654 --> 25:11.275
commissioned. So there was, I guess, what you 
would have to call a case system. Either you

25:16.629 --> 25:21.917
belonged to the right family or you had the right 
connection to become an officer. And it was very

25:21.937 --> 25:24.581
unlikely that anyone else would ever do it. And 
then as far as corruption around, there was some.

25:28.286 --> 25:32.893
We know for a fact that some of the jobs were being 
paid for. It was pretty much a standing joke. If you

25:35.296 --> 25:40.965
wanted to be a province chief, you'd come up with 
$25,000 to $50,000, depending on which province

25:35.296 --> 25:40.965
you wanted to go. You could get the job. district 
chiefs were a little bit less, but there were

25:43.165 --> 25:57.542
places that

25:43.165 --> 25:57.542
officers could go and make pretty good money at it, 
because they were rampant corruption going on. We

25:57.582 --> 25:59.584
knew that, but there's not much we could do about 
it. We had to live with it. It depended on how well

26:01.266 --> 26:06.453
the guy did his job in relation to making all the 
money for himself. An example, one of the first

26:08.435 --> 26:12.700
district chiefs I ran into when I got there was a 
major Our district was very well controlled. He

26:16.634 --> 26:27.953
was doing an excellent job, but he kind of got 
caught up short somewhere from what we heard when

26:16.634 --> 26:27.953
he got relieved and that he wasn't paying enough 
kickback to the people upstairs and they fired

26:16.634 --> 26:27.953
him. And his replacement, while he might have been 
paying the kickback and everything, he wasn't

26:29.876 --> 26:38.350
doing the job that the Major did and we were losing 
the ground with him until we got him replaced. He

26:38.752 --> 26:41.075
was pretty much satisfied with the status quo. We 
don't do anything. D.C. don't do anything. We just

26:44.500 --> 26:46.042
sit here and watch. It took a while to get rid of him, 
but eventually we could. With enough pressure

26:51.409 --> 26:57.057
from the top side, we forced him to be removed. I'm 
sure there was corruption everywhere. From what

27:01.923 --> 27:08.472
we can see in here, it's not something we set out to 
prove, but you could always make a case for it, I

27:01.923 --> 27:08.472
guess, if you wanted to. Did you and your 
colleagues there feel really frustrated, like

27:09.262 --> 27:15.251
you were just spinning your wheels with a bunch of 
corrupt officers?

27:17.874 --> 27:19.897
Did y'all waste any time at all? Maybe, perhaps it 
was our province, but we had a pretty good group of

27:22.621 --> 27:29.571
people there as far as I could see. Our province 
chief was a lieutenant colonel, and he was very

27:29.591 --> 27:38.003
good at his job. and running the civilian side of 
the government and also the military side

27:39.485 --> 27:44.191
operations. One of the better people that I knew 
out there. I don't think that overall we had too

27:51.160 --> 27:55.045
much of a problem with them. We were getting what we 
wanted done with them. Sometimes it was

27:57.988 --> 28:01.333
frustrating that we didn't seem to be moving fast 
enough. I guess that's the Americans. get up and go

28:05.388 --> 28:08.171
get them right now, and let's not wait any time. So 
that was the only thing that was really

28:08.191 --> 28:10.374
frustrating. We didn't seem to be moving at a fast 
enough rate for where we wanted to go, but that's

28:10.394 --> 28:19.865
the difference in cultures. They just didn't work 
at the same speed we wanted to. This probably

28:24.390 --> 28:35.023
wasn't common or might have even been nonexistent 
among you and other MACD officers, but were you

28:24.390 --> 28:35.023
aware of any incidents at all of bragging or men 
killing their own officers? among the Americans,

28:35.847 --> 28:37.049
sir? Not in our, in the advisory. I doubt seriously 
that any of that would have occurred.

28:47.282 --> 28:57.855
Some misleading movies out, Platoon, I think, had 
an incident where several sergeants were talking

28:47.282 --> 28:57.855
about, you know, fragging an officer. One other TV 
show, Vietnam Story, I had an incident on one of

29:00.974 --> 29:10.989
theirs where an entire group of NCOs and privates 
were going to frag the company commander, but

29:00.974 --> 29:10.989
those were in the line units. And the advisory had a 
much closer knit group, five or six people. If you

29:17.859 --> 29:22.065
work in a province, you only have 30 or 40 people 
there. And everybody's fairly high-ranking NCOs

29:22.085 --> 29:27.353
and officers, so we didn't have that kind of a 
problem. I don't know of any incident of any

29:27.805 --> 29:35.878
advisory personnel being fragged.

29:36.479 --> 29:41.768
What did you think of the motivation and the 
inspiration of the Arvin troops compared to the

29:36.479 --> 29:41.768
North Vietnamese troops?

29:45.113 --> 29:51.163
Rather poor.

29:51.869 --> 30:21.167
have to attribute their lack of motivation to 
their leadership and the leadership being what it

29:51.869 --> 30:21.167
was somewhat poor the way they went about it as a 
comparison at the district i had one company and

29:51.869 --> 30:21.167
one platoon who were all xbc they had come over on 
the chew white program which when they

29:51.869 --> 30:21.167
surrendered they were repatriated given some 
indoctrination and training and allowed to go

29:51.869 --> 30:21.167
back to where they came from most of them joined the 
rf companies the pf companies so we had one company

29:51.869 --> 30:21.167
was all XBC and one platoon that was all XBC. In 
comparison to the other companies they had, they

30:24.561 --> 30:32.634
were much more aggressive and a whole lot more 
willing to get out and do the job. In terms of going

30:33.475 --> 30:47.336
out with someone, after I kind of got over the idea 
that they were XBC, I found it a whole lot easier to

30:33.475 --> 30:47.336
get things done and felt a lot safer going out with 
those people. It was like they were telling them to

30:47.356 --> 30:49.720
do what they wanted to do, and when the shooting 
started they wanted to get involved in it whereas

30:51.033 --> 31:20.652
the other companies you might just look around 
find yourself standing there by yourself because

30:51.033 --> 31:20.652
they've gone the other direction so i would think 
they were much much better motivated for whatever

30:51.033 --> 31:20.652
reason they were motivated or how they got them 
motivated i don't know but they seem to be more

30:51.033 --> 31:20.652
motivated than they are overall do you think it's 
fair to say you could attribute that to the fact

30:51.033 --> 31:20.652
that that the north had ho chi minh to rally around 
whereas the south the government was more or less

30:51.033 --> 31:20.652
just were no stable leaders for the people well if 
you're talking about nba probably talking about

31:21.323 --> 31:48.951
vc uh the average vc is where we were uh didn't know 
much about ho chi minh and could care less what he

31:21.323 --> 31:48.951
wanted or didn't want the vc in the southern part of 
the country were being motivated locally by i

31:21.323 --> 31:48.951
guess nationalism if you want to look at it that way 
we could never really get any your idea some

31:50.483 --> 32:17.402
of that drafted but whatever means they used to get 
them indoctrinated to get a more motivated it was

31:50.483 --> 32:17.402
working people they just go on the village okay you 
know part of the BC but they got more out of them than

31:50.483 --> 32:17.402
the garbage to get out of them or whatever means 
they were using they didn't usually want to talk to

31:50.483 --> 32:17.402
you too much about how they got into it. The biggest 
thing I could see was that many of them were

32:21.438 --> 32:25.822
disappointed or disillusioned with what the B.C. 
had offered and was reasonably quick. It wasn't

32:28.325 --> 32:33.589
turning out to be exactly the picture that the B.C. 
probably had sold them when they went with them.

32:35.731 --> 32:41.376
They were just getting a little frustrated out 
there that nothing was happening like they were

32:35.731 --> 32:41.376
supposed to. They couldn't see any progress being 
made. If the B.C. were any better than the other,

32:44.199 --> 32:49.684
they were much more in danger of being with the 
B.C., so they eventually just give it up and quit.

32:51.959 --> 33:03.894
Do you think there was any cooperation between the 
North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong, or were they

32:51.959 --> 33:03.894
two separate entities?

33:03.914 --> 33:04.674
I don't really know. From reports, we do know that 
toward the latter end of the war, the NVA were, in

33:06.597 --> 33:15.368
some cases, actually running the VC units. They 
went in first as advisors with them. We do know that

33:21.305 --> 33:30.035
some of the BC units in the northern areas were 
being led by North Vietnamese officers toward the

33:21.305 --> 33:30.035
latter part of the war. There was some

33:32.357 --> 33:40.486
distrust in the southern part, as best we can find 
out. They didn't really trust the few NVA that got

33:40.506 --> 33:43.790
down into that area. They were mostly over toward 
the Cambodian border, but from reports and intel

33:44.130 --> 33:50.097
we could get from over there, The few NVA that were 
down there weren't really accepted and nobody

33:51.275 --> 33:58.528
really trusted them as far as they could find out. 
There was always that feeling they were trying to

33:58.548 --> 34:02.555
take over. That's one theory that kept cropping 
up. The NVA were trying to take over. The few

34:11.029 --> 34:15.477
high-ranking officers and officials from the VC 
that did defect pretty much were putting that idea

34:16.655 --> 34:35.461
forth, that they had a feeling that if they did win, 
that the NBA was going to be in trouble and not the

34:16.655 --> 34:35.461
D.C. That was kind of a brink point for some of them, 
particularly the high-ranking people that

34:16.655 --> 34:35.461
defected. On how effective a strategy do you think 
bombing was in Vietnam? Should there have been

34:39.326 --> 34:43.472
more, say, in the North or in Laos and Cambodia?

34:47.317 --> 34:52.023
Bombing in South Vietnam, I don't know. I have to go 
on speculation and stories. We had no bombing in

34:57.109 --> 34:58.591
our area. We had one or two B-52 strikes that I can 
remember, and as far as where they went, I could see

35:00.613 --> 35:07.903
no value for them anyway. They were in suspected BC 
areas and out in the mangrove swamps. as the best as

35:13.372 --> 35:17.197
we could determine later after looking at the 
strike assessment photos. We tore up a lot of mango

35:18.660 --> 35:24.047
trees and made some bigger pools out there, but 
fortunately, no, we didn't hurt anybody. I have a

35:25.149 --> 35:28.333
feeling that dropping that stuff in the jungle was 
about the same effect. You knocked down a lot of

35:28.353 --> 35:37.727
trees and made a few clearings here and there, but 
effectively you were hoping you were going to hit

35:28.353 --> 35:37.727
something with all that bombing. Occasionally 
they would get lucky, but I don't know. in the South

35:42.008 --> 35:44.111
that the bombing was all that effective. Maybe in 
the North, if some of the targets had been changed,

35:44.251 --> 35:52.843
it might have changed the complexion of the war, 
but that's pure speculation.

35:55.707 --> 35:58.111
Do you think that the United States could have won 
the war? And if so, maybe, you know, with more

35:58.191 --> 36:08.465
pacification, and what kind of programs would you 
have had a choice?

36:08.485 --> 36:09.687
If I would have had a choice,

36:14.527 --> 36:15.408
We would have left there.

36:19.855 --> 36:27.367
I think Kennedy at one point was talking about 
pulling all the advisers out before his

36:19.855 --> 36:27.367
assassination. I think somewhere in the 
administration at that time, there was already

36:28.309 --> 36:34.579
the feeling that we couldn't win the thing over 
there. And the rumors were floating up and down to

36:35.500 --> 36:39.767
the military at the time. I was still here in the 
States. There were things being put out inside the

36:43.872 --> 36:51.504
Army probably in the military that civilians were 
never made aware of. But there was a pretty

36:51.524 --> 36:56.673
definite feel that Kennedy wanted to get us out of 
there. He couldn't see any way to win the thing,

36:58.175 --> 37:05.026
except just get much, much more involved. And even 
then, he couldn't really. Some of his people were

37:07.290 --> 37:11.196
telling him, no matter what we put in there, we 
couldn't win the war. Johnson came along, it

37:12.965 --> 37:16.470
changed for whatever reason. Whether it was the 
macho image we can't afford to back down or

37:17.311 --> 37:20.716
whatever, I'm not sure. I don't know that we could 
have done anything differently that would have

37:22.198 --> 37:39.664
made any difference in the outcome unless we were 
willing to make a total commitment to a war and put

37:22.198 --> 37:39.664
whatever manpower and machine power it required 
to get in there and physically take every inch of

37:22.198 --> 37:39.664
ground away from them right up to the Chinese 
border. then you might have effectively won the

37:41.095 --> 37:45.621
war, but you would have had to control North 
Vietnam also. Do you think that the Viet Cong were

37:46.562 --> 37:55.953
just too deeply rooted into South Vietnam by the 
time the U.S. entered, or was that part of the

37:46.562 --> 37:55.953
problem? By the time we got into it, they were well 
entrenched. A lot of those people were Viet Minh

38:00.880 --> 38:10.832
that had stayed in the South after the separation 
of the French left.

38:12.719 --> 38:21.210
A lot of them were Viet Minh who had infiltrated 
south after that period of time and started the

38:12.719 --> 38:21.210
V.C. movement down south. The V.C. movement 
wasn't what we were fighting initially or what the

38:24.233 --> 38:28.058
Arvin was fighting initially. They were fighting 
Viet Minh just like the French were. Eventually it

38:31.362 --> 38:32.904
changed over to V.C. with the local southern 
organization. But they were pretty well

38:36.849 --> 38:41.595
entrenched already.

38:42.402 --> 38:51.031
had been built up during World War II, had been 
built up during the fighting of the French, and

38:42.402 --> 38:51.031
essentially the cadre and everybody were in 
place. It was just a matter of recruitment to build

38:51.331 --> 38:53.894
up the forces.

38:57.097 --> 39:08.308
I think that they lost an opportunity to settle, I 
think, politically in French land,

38:57.097 --> 39:08.308
realistically, considering everything Dr. 
Anderson's talk about it and everything I've read

39:08.879 --> 39:23.075
or heard since then, it really, we lost it when we 
refused to talk to Ho Chi Minh, and we lost it again

39:08.879 --> 39:23.075
when the French left, when they should have just 
turned it back over to the Vietnamese and let them

39:08.879 --> 39:23.075
settle it themselves.

39:26.499 --> 39:27.380
That's a personal view. I don't really see that we 
could have done anything realistically that

39:27.580 --> 39:36.490
would have changed it, maybe prolonged it 
somewhat, but I don't think it would have changed.

39:36.740 --> 39:43.005
A lot of people seem to think that after Tet, the 
Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese were so weak and

39:36.740 --> 39:43.005
that we could have won. Do you feel that without the 
media and protesters bringing such a negative

39:43.025 --> 39:54.395
image on the war, do you feel we could have won? I 
think, and this is personal opinion, that if we

39:54.916 --> 40:03.563
ever were going to win the war, it would have had to 
have been after Tet. We would have had to have

40:04.264 --> 40:05.785
committed 110% and gone in and done the job. 
Because we did a very thorough job on destroying

40:08.867 --> 40:17.522
most of all the hardcore VC units in the South. And a 
great deal of damage inflicted on whatever NVA

40:17.542 --> 40:22.650
units had participated. So I think if we ever had a 
chance to win, it was immediately after 10. We

40:26.357 --> 40:27.959
didn't follow up on it. And yes, the news media was 
probably a direct cause of why we didn't. They

40:35.624 --> 40:37.086
looked upon it as a defeat. And all the military 
experts tell you, we won. We won. And we had them on

40:44.233 --> 40:50.160
the ropes and ready for the count if we'd just gone 
in and done something else. But we backed off

40:50.260 --> 40:59.110
because of this publicity and outcry at home.

41:00.575 --> 41:08.807
What's your opinion of draft dodgers and anti-war 
protesters, like Jane Fonda, for example?

41:08.827 --> 41:15.037
Well, the draft dodgers that left the country,

41:08.827 --> 41:15.037
I didn't agree with them. But on the other hand, I 
couldn't say they were wrong. If you believe in

41:21.025 --> 41:25.452
something strongly enough, then obviously you 
have a right to do it. like to tell people

41:27.001 --> 41:29.164
occasionally. I stood in front of the flag for 22 
years to give a guy a right to do that. So who am I to

41:33.268 --> 41:36.673
criticize him if he goes if I'm defending his right 
to do it? And I can't criticize him if he goes. I had

41:41.038 --> 41:47.946
more respect for those people than I did for some of 
the anti-war protesters, particularly the ones

41:41.038 --> 41:47.946
that tried to influence the gis here in the states 
those who are out there trying to work on the public

41:49.023 --> 42:15.925
is one thing those who aim directly at the military 
and try to influence the desertion rate the awol

41:49.023 --> 42:15.925
rate those

41:49.023 --> 42:15.925
they weren't really doing anything to me it was 
worthwhile the others I guess if you look at the

42:16.765 --> 42:20.189
broad view, they were influencing the political 
arena. If you want something done, you have to

42:20.209 --> 42:22.552
influence politics. Those people who were trying 
to convert people and get them to desert were...

42:31.344 --> 42:33.186
I don't feel they had a right to be doing that. If 
anybody had anything against anybody within that

42:33.907 --> 42:38.773
particular group, the rest of them... They were 
doing their thing, I was doing mine. As long as we

42:43.104 --> 42:46.949
didn't really get in conflict with each other, I 
couldn't see anything wrong with it. They were

42:46.989 --> 42:48.271
entitled to do it. They were right to do it. How 
realistic do you think movies like a few popular

42:52.216 --> 43:01.548
ones were, Platoon, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse 
Now, how realistic were those in portraying like

42:52.216 --> 43:01.548
in Vietnam? Deer Hunter is a farce. It had nothing 
to do with Vietnam. If they were trying to put

43:09.736 --> 43:16.507
across a theme, I'm not sure what theme they were 
trying to put across. But in terms of being

43:16.527 --> 43:23.478
realistic about the war, total bummer.

43:23.498 --> 43:25.922
Full metal jacket.

43:29.058 --> 43:30.359
That's based on Marines. I've never had much of a 
concept of Marines doing anything right. Still, I

43:34.963 --> 43:43.391
couldn't see that even Marines would be doing 
things as stupid as some things were going on in

43:34.963 --> 43:43.391
that movie. The only one I've seen that has any 
realistic idea to me of what the war is going is

43:45.273 --> 43:51.499
Platoon. It got down pretty much at that level on 
the front line with the guys. There's some things

43:59.973 --> 44:13.465
that showed or portrayed in the movie that 
probably wouldn't have been happening in the

43:59.973 --> 44:13.465
actual situation, but it's about as close to 
realistic as I can see from the movies I've seen.

44:13.485 --> 44:18.990
It's about the most realistic down at the front 
line level. Some things in it I was sort of blown out

44:21.092 --> 44:25.316
of proportion, but it made the movie better. I gave 
the story a little bit more zip or whatever you want

44:25.336 --> 44:28.579
to look at it, but On the whole, it probably is the 
most realistic portrayal of what the frontline

44:29.521 --> 44:33.946
soldiers were involved in. The rest of them was 
just sort

44:34.006 --> 44:39.072
of, I don't know, a bump to me. They didn't portray 
the war. They put across other messages, but it

44:40.834 --> 44:57.013
wasn't, if that was their attempt to put some other 
message across, they did that very well, but

44:40.834 --> 44:57.013
didn't, as far as showing what the war was, not a 
very good portrayal.

44:59.052 --> 45:10.604
What do you think about the stereotype that 
persists in a lot of these movies about the

44:59.052 --> 45:10.604
unstable, mentally

44:59.052 --> 45:10.604
unstable, who can't adjust to society? Is that 
realistic at all? Well, we're dealing with a

45:15.269 --> 45:23.457
portrayal of a one-time, one-tour person. And I 
have friends who were there a lot longer than I was.

45:32.751 --> 45:33.954
I spent two tours there. I had friends who were 
there as much as eight years.

45:41.088 --> 45:43.992
I think if anybody was in a position to become 
paranoid, we were. You're 60, 70 miles away from

45:44.513 --> 45:53.026
nobody, and the only thing you've got to rely on is 
the guy next to you and some doubtful Vietnamese to

45:44.513 --> 45:53.026
keep you alive. If anybody should have come out of 
there paranoid, it probably should have

45:53.106 --> 45:59.615
been us. Personally, I think that most of these 
cases are real... off the deep end type when you get

46:04.426 --> 46:06.328
back here. There was something on the unstable 
side before they went anywhere. Vietnam just was

46:10.273 --> 46:13.817
the trigger. Had they stayed at home, it would have 
happened anyway at some later date because of

46:15.238 --> 46:19.523
something else. Most of the people I know who were 
there two or three times weren't affected like

46:22.086 --> 46:26.952
that. So I don't see how other people decided. 
Being there at one time would drive somebody over

46:28.994 --> 46:33.319
the deep end unless he wasn't already somewhere. 
pretty close to that point anyway. Any other type

46:36.700 --> 46:40.525
of pressure or situation later on probably would 
have gotten the same results. It's just that it was

46:41.928 --> 46:55.448
much more compact and put on him in a very short 
space of time in Vietnam where it would have just

46:41.928 --> 46:55.448
taken a longer time to build up out here, but I think 
it would have happened anyway. So to me it's unfair

46:55.528 --> 46:56.590
to say that
