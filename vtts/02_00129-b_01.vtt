WEBVTT

00:02.782 --> 00:10.635
Mr. Harrington and I was about to say that, as a faculty member, we would chuckle that he pronounced it the association of former students.

00:13.120 --> 00:14.041
You lived at home?

00:15.584 --> 00:17.126
This was bad.

00:17.146 --> 00:22.275
I was a day duck, a lowly, lowly day duck.

00:22.255 --> 00:23.997
Did youngsters get teased?

00:24.437 --> 00:27.461
Oh, oh, teased unmercifully.

00:27.481 --> 00:29.343
You know, you just, you didn't rate.

00:29.503 --> 00:30.504
You weren't alive.

00:30.524 --> 00:32.246
And, of course, you were in the Corps.

00:33.047 --> 00:40.134
Which meant I took a course in military science and drilled with a unit on campus.

00:40.214 --> 00:50.305
I remember I drilled with B-battery, was it field or field artillery, and that was torture because I was,

00:51.095 --> 00:53.158
I was not one of them, you know.

00:53.218 --> 01:01.931
The local boys suffered through that, and we had to do it, and, you know, we just did something terrible.

01:02.832 --> 01:11.625
Did they even then do that old thing that I heard about, look to your left, look to your right, because... You won't want any, they're not going to be here.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.708
Yes, Sam Hopper.

01:15.291 --> 01:20.258
The people who did that were Sam Hopper, Cliff Ransdell,

01:23.444 --> 01:24.105
Who else?

01:25.529 --> 01:33.266
There was a group of people that up, turn this thing off, a group of people over in the Aggieland Inn.

01:34.809 --> 01:36.293
What did they call that thing?

01:36.313 --> 01:43.208
It was the beginning of, oh,

01:45.702 --> 01:48.767
Well, Austin Curley, I'm sure, was over there.

01:48.988 --> 01:50.591
The advising, the counseling.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.093
Yeah, counseling, advising.

01:52.113 --> 01:54.137
It was all done out of the Aggieland Inn.

01:54.337 --> 01:56.301
I guess it wasn't called that.

01:56.321 --> 01:59.186
They had a name for it, but that's what it was.

01:59.286 --> 02:06.799
That was the first elements of any sort of advising and counseling.

02:07.150 --> 02:08.352
which came later.

02:08.432 --> 02:10.595
I didn't have that my freshman year.

02:12.277 --> 02:13.980
That came later.

02:14.120 --> 02:20.929
You're a full-time student, and do you go through four years straight, uninterrupted?

02:20.949 --> 02:22.592
No, I dropped out.

02:22.672 --> 02:35.790
I changed my major the fall of, I stopped and worked for Joe Falk and Brian who ran an auto store the spring of 47.

02:36.496 --> 02:41.945
And then I came back after that and went into business, the College of Business.

02:42.105 --> 02:43.648
I was not an engineer.

02:43.808 --> 02:45.270
I was not a scientist.

02:45.311 --> 02:50.419
It was quite apparent by that time that I was.

02:51.361 --> 03:00.175
And then, by the time I was a senior, they brought in a course called Building Products Marketing.

03:01.032 --> 03:03.234
which lasted for about two years.

03:03.434 --> 03:11.122
But in June of 1950, I was the first and only graduate in building products marketing.

03:11.943 --> 03:21.132
I was able to pick up some of my engineering courses that were normally not, didn't fit into the business curriculum.

03:21.773 --> 03:26.938
But I took a lot of little architecture courses, which I enjoyed.

03:27.779 --> 03:30.945
had kind of a bend in that direction in the business.

03:33.750 --> 03:39.740
Trying to think who might have been in the College of Business.

03:39.780 --> 03:43.527
Of course, Leland, Tom Leland led the thing

03:44.215 --> 03:49.440
Most of my teachers were graduate students.

03:51.642 --> 03:53.424
You lived at home all these years.

03:53.444 --> 03:55.366
Yes.

03:56.788 --> 03:59.410
But you were in the Corps those first two years.

03:59.430 --> 04:00.531
Yes, first two years.

04:00.631 --> 04:02.033
And then dropped out?

04:02.153 --> 04:02.513
Yes.

04:03.274 --> 04:06.357
Now, I didn't actually finish that spring of 47.

04:06.817 --> 04:12.383
I had to go back and pick that up later when I was a senior.

04:13.122 --> 04:15.786
It was kind of an unusual thing happened then.

04:15.806 --> 04:31.789
The Life magazine came down and did a thing on the core and a picture of the core appeared on the cover and I'm in that picture.

04:32.225 --> 04:38.414
And I can tell people that I've been in the movies and I've had my picture on the cover of Life magazine.

04:38.454 --> 04:40.637
I was there with 4,000 other people.

04:41.839 --> 04:43.261
But nevertheless, it was there.

04:43.301 --> 04:49.509
And I can pick myself out because I was standing a little thing off to the side.

04:49.690 --> 04:54.857
And I was standing next to a guy much shorter than I. And you can see me sticking up.

04:55.377 --> 05:00.405
next to him and this little three or four of us on a front row of something there.

05:00.886 --> 05:04.612
What was their, in general, what was their message?

05:05.954 --> 05:06.755
Of that article?

05:07.697 --> 05:10.060
Was it any good, bad, indifferent, or what?

05:10.100 --> 05:12.464
No, it was good, yeah.

05:12.484 --> 05:14.247
It was very,

05:15.155 --> 05:16.136
Good picture.

05:16.376 --> 05:21.302
In fact, I don't know why that picture's not up here and I've looked for it in the core center up here.

05:21.322 --> 05:21.903
That ought to be.

05:23.385 --> 05:26.749
I have a copy of it here and I'm sure they must have one.

05:26.769 --> 05:29.552
1947, you said.

05:29.592 --> 05:31.334
No, no, no, no.

05:31.374 --> 05:34.618
This article was written my senior year, 49.

05:34.638 --> 05:35.819
49, oh.

05:36.100 --> 05:38.462
It would have been, I can't tell you what month.

05:38.663 --> 05:39.964
No, but I was thinking about the picture.

05:40.822 --> 05:44.407
Is that the cover picture?

05:44.527 --> 05:57.745
Yes, I was saying, I went back and had to pick up that military thing and during my senior year, the one I missed my freshman year in 47, is that right?

05:57.765 --> 05:59.468
45, 46?

06:00.289 --> 06:04.855
No, I went a year, that was the last part of my sophomore year that I was not in school.

06:05.560 --> 06:09.907
I had to go back and pick that up when I was a senior.

06:09.967 --> 06:19.421
I was drilled with the Corps and by then it was more relaxed and wasn't quite as bad to be a day duck by then.

06:19.602 --> 06:26.252
In fact, they had a company of day students by then, which was a lot better.

06:26.975 --> 06:28.958
and so that wasn't nearly so bad.

06:29.238 --> 06:35.327
But the number of day students was still quite small compared to the total.

06:35.787 --> 06:38.291
Yes, but big enough to have this.

06:39.252 --> 06:50.789
My brother, my younger brother's in the class of 51, and he was quite active in the Corps, and far more than I... Where was commencement held?

06:52.451 --> 06:53.893
In Guyon Hall.

06:54.312 --> 06:58.819
Now, my particular year, I graduated in June of 50, and we split it.

06:59.920 --> 07:11.758
Omar Bradley was our commencement speaker, and Don Jarvis, who designed the Rudder Tower, and we since died, but he was our valedictorian, and we split.

07:11.998 --> 07:20.591
Half of us were in Guyon Hall, and half of us were in the Assembly Hall, and the speakers swapped during that.

07:21.011 --> 07:21.552
Now,

07:22.544 --> 07:27.830
The year before that, my class in 49 was in Kyle Field.

07:28.811 --> 07:32.635
Now I guess it was raining and we had to go inside then.

07:32.695 --> 07:41.103
Now I would have had a strange event in my life had it not been for my high school superintendent.

07:41.844 --> 07:45.428
I graduated from grade school in Guyon Hall.

07:45.608 --> 07:50.273
We had a graduation ceremony from the seventh grade to high school.

07:50.894 --> 07:55.120
Normally, the high school graduated from Guyon Hall.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.664
My particular year, W.D.

07:58.704 --> 08:03.831
Bunning wanted us to go up to the First Baptist Church, so I graduated there.

08:04.432 --> 08:12.423
But had it not been for him, grade school, high school, and college all graduated from Guyon Hall.

08:12.903 --> 08:16.588
But as it was, it was seventh grade and college too.

08:16.989 --> 08:19.332
During those undergraduate years,

08:19.700 --> 08:25.767
Who were some famous personalities that came to visit the campus?

08:27.910 --> 08:33.496
Well, you know, they made the movie here in 1942 when I was still in high school.

08:33.857 --> 08:35.519
Were you aware of it being?

08:35.819 --> 08:37.521
Oh, yeah, we were in the middle of it all.

08:37.802 --> 08:39.063
Describe that.

08:40.545 --> 08:48.154
There was 1942, Robert Mitchum was here, Martha O'Driscoll, they were the majors.

08:49.012 --> 08:53.580
a fellow by the name of Richard Quinn, Q-U-I-N-N, I think.

08:55.624 --> 09:03.537
Oh, an old man, I can't think of his name now, played the part of an old chemistry professor, somebody you've seen many, many times in the movies.

09:04.399 --> 09:09.287
They were all here, and of course, we'd spend our lives up there gawking.

09:09.307 --> 09:13.635
In fact, there's another place, that's why I said it was in the movies,

09:14.358 --> 09:41.901
one saturday in fact this thing opened with a scene at kyle field and they were talking about the events that you know this thing was centered around there was a stage down on the field and they they had us local people come up and sit in the stadium they fed us a chicken dinner to come up there and sit in the stadium two of my buddies and i were sitting kind of alone and we're

09:42.455 --> 09:46.120
turned around looking at the camera part of that time.

09:46.320 --> 09:58.116
And in one of the posters that appeared on the marquees at the movie houses is this scene looking down across Kyle's view.

09:58.136 --> 10:02.722
And you can see these three little kids, their faces turned around looking at the camera.

10:03.543 --> 10:09.070
So that's why I say I've been in the movies and I've had my picture on Life magazine.

10:09.674 --> 10:11.916
But, you know, they would just see anything.

10:11.936 --> 10:13.378
About how long were they here?

10:16.921 --> 10:23.988
It must have been in the fall because I can remember Martha O'Driscoll coming to one of our football games, you know.

10:24.008 --> 10:26.311
I mean, was it a day or a week?

10:26.331 --> 10:27.772
Oh, no, no, it was weeks.

10:28.633 --> 10:29.694
Oh, yeah, weeks.

10:32.517 --> 10:36.221
They didn't have a world premiere here, did they?

10:37.262 --> 10:38.483
I've never heard that mentioned.

10:38.851 --> 10:39.692
I believe they did.

10:39.832 --> 10:40.393
Is that right?

10:40.413 --> 10:41.274
I believe they did.

10:41.454 --> 10:43.957
And y'all got to see Robert Mitchum in the flesh?

10:44.258 --> 10:44.878
Oh, yeah.

10:45.099 --> 10:45.920
Yeah, I guess.

10:45.940 --> 10:50.325
Oh, another one was, oh, dadgummit.

10:53.409 --> 10:55.652
Oh, his daddy was in movies.

10:58.355 --> 11:04.943
In fact, I've seen this guy, he's an old man now, but he was a freshman in the movie, played a freshman.

11:06.762 --> 11:11.089
Where did they stay when they were here?

11:12.031 --> 11:14.575
I think in the Aggieland Inn, I really don't know.

11:14.595 --> 11:16.077
I just assumed they did.

11:16.098 --> 11:21.186
We would have some named bands that would come here.

11:21.246 --> 11:22.168
Such as?

11:23.029 --> 11:23.670
Do you remember?

11:23.790 --> 11:28.979
Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, people of this nature would come.

11:29.059 --> 11:32.044
This was more before World War II.

11:32.581 --> 11:37.105
But they would come and have big, huge dances in Sbiza Hall.

11:37.125 --> 11:37.966
In Sbiza.

11:38.527 --> 11:44.352
And B, what were the key, the big dances?

11:44.373 --> 11:50.338
Oh, well, of course, each, you had the senior ring dance in the spring.

11:51.119 --> 11:54.643
The cotton pageant was a big thing back then.

11:54.663 --> 11:59.247
It was, you know, promoting the cotton world.

11:59.362 --> 12:08.217
And then each of the military organizations had theirs during the very formal, very elite things.

12:08.697 --> 12:25.285
As a matter of fact, when, you know, I ultimately went to when I first knew you over under, when I worked under Wayne Stark, we would go to those things then, you know, as chaperones, if they were called that by then.

12:25.973 --> 12:28.956
Very, very formal type thing.

12:29.196 --> 12:35.441
And particularly back in the 40s, there would be long dresses.

12:35.742 --> 12:37.583
Oh, yeah.

12:37.603 --> 12:48.513
And as I've interviewed others, they tell me over and over about the good conduct, that the women all loved it.

12:48.813 --> 12:53.938
They felt like they were treated like true celebrities.

12:54.172 --> 12:56.935
and that the men all said they were on their best manners.

12:57.575 --> 13:00.018
Oh, very definitely.

13:01.759 --> 13:05.082
We would dress to go to a football game.

13:05.483 --> 13:14.251
You'd put on, I mean, a suit to go to, and women that wore their nice clothes and mums and whatnot, and I don't know when that disintegrated.

13:16.293 --> 13:19.957
All right, what was A&M in those days, what was A&M doing correctly?

13:20.017 --> 13:21.478
What was A&M doing right?

13:24.563 --> 13:43.224
Oh gosh, I think, you mean academically or socially or any, I think everything they did was probably, you know, it was such a, of course during the depression, people came here to get off the farm, you know, they'd do anything to get to come to, you know, to A&M.

13:43.244 --> 13:45.907
Things were pretty desolate out there somewhere.

13:47.188 --> 13:53.035
And so I think, you know, aside from the hazing, which got pretty brutal sometime,

13:53.791 --> 14:20.119
It was an area where you learn to be a real person, just the association of being with other people, which is what the Army did for a lot of people during World War II, you know, this brought them into, if you can say anything good about a war, well, it brought people into close associations with other people like-minded for a common cause.

14:20.977 --> 14:34.303
And A&M did that, and I think the dignity of the John Paul Abbots and the others were probably a remarkable teaching tool just in being alive from day to day.

14:35.245 --> 14:36.868
You asked about the famous people.

14:38.130 --> 14:42.158
One of the famous people actually stayed at this house.

14:42.695 --> 14:52.946
dated a boy that we knew, and she later, it was Catherine Grandstaff, who was later Kathy Grant, married Bing Crosby.

14:53.606 --> 14:56.670
But she stayed here, and we got to know her.

14:57.250 --> 15:09.263
And in fact, I remember she came back later, she was Miss Texas or something, and she'd gotten a new Ford convertible, I think, a 50 model, and came by and showed it to us.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.385
And she referred to that car

15:12.040 --> 15:17.066
She still had it when she went to California and married Bing, and she referred to it.

15:17.106 --> 15:24.534
It had 80 or 90,000 miles on it, and I thought that was kind of strange that she would still have it, but a real proud.

15:24.714 --> 15:30.340
All right, you graduate, and then when do you go to work for A&M?

15:30.360 --> 15:31.922
I went to work for A&M in 1954.

15:33.984 --> 15:41.052
Believe it or not, I responded to an ad in a Houston paper for a job that was available here.

15:41.757 --> 15:54.016
I had, during this period after World War II, they drafted people through May of 1946.

15:54.797 --> 16:01.588
I turned 18 two weeks after the World War II draft died.

16:01.688 --> 16:03.311
I turned 18 at the end of May.

16:04.192 --> 16:07.377
That draft bill died the middle of May of 46.

16:08.032 --> 16:10.514
So I was free and clear on that.

16:10.574 --> 16:19.161
Now, some of my high school buddies who had birthdays before that were, you know, drafted and they went into the occupational stuff.

16:19.241 --> 16:21.563
None of them were in the war or in the fighting.

16:22.684 --> 16:25.427
But then the draft started up again in 78.

16:25.567 --> 16:30.411
And I joined the National Guard.

16:30.431 --> 16:33.153
You said 78, 48.

16:33.173 --> 16:34.574
48, 48.

16:34.634 --> 16:37.937
I joined the National Guard

16:38.677 --> 16:44.125
I think school did not exempt you at that time, if I'm not mistaken.

16:44.285 --> 16:50.114
So a lot of us joined the guard to be able to stay here and finish our school.

16:51.576 --> 16:56.684
And when I graduated, of course, the Korean War broke out immediately.

16:57.725 --> 17:04.515
And I took a job in Houston right after I graduated selling kitchens or something down there.

17:04.985 --> 17:10.994
and realized this unit was going to be called up, you know, at the 49th Armored Division.

17:12.015 --> 17:25.255
I came home and worked with a guy who was the unit administrator out here, a vet student, and he was going to graduate, I guess, in 51.

17:25.859 --> 17:37.393
And I decided I could be the unit administrator out there, and I worked with him that whole year out there waiting for this thing to be called up, and it never was.

17:37.473 --> 17:51.230
Texas had two divisions, the 36th and the 49th, and five other states had two divisions, and all the other, Illinois and New York and California, had one of their divisions call up.

17:51.290 --> 17:52.592
Texas never did.

17:53.028 --> 17:56.331
So I was never on active duty anywhere.

17:56.411 --> 18:00.816
And I was the unit administrator out there and just stayed on.

18:00.836 --> 18:02.698
I mean, you know, it was a state job.

18:03.619 --> 18:11.487
And then I saw this ad in the paper for someone to do administrative work in a small college community, I think, somewhere.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.590
And I thought, that's got, ain't no other besides A&M.

18:15.291 --> 18:16.192
So I answered the ad.

18:16.212 --> 18:22.478
And sure enough, it was the chief clerk for the engineering experiment station under Dr.

18:23.048 --> 18:23.689
A.W.

18:23.729 --> 18:30.221
Mello, and Howard Barlow was the dean of engineering at the time.

18:30.322 --> 18:36.974
So I took that job and, well, I went to St.

18:37.014 --> 18:40.180
Louis for a couple of years

18:40.514 --> 18:44.339
Calvin Guest and Earl Cunningham, you might remember them.

18:44.399 --> 18:53.331
And they got me to go up there and install laundry, corn-operated laundry equipment and government housing stuff up in St.

18:53.391 --> 18:53.791
Louis.

18:54.472 --> 18:55.293
When was that?

18:55.313 --> 18:59.279
This was, we left here in the June of 56.

18:59.519 --> 19:03.484
Because they were almost the world pioneers.

19:03.464 --> 19:05.407
That's right, they were.

19:06.288 --> 19:07.570
I knew them when they were poor.

19:08.311 --> 19:13.198
They were struggling for money and I've been with them to the St.

19:13.238 --> 19:16.022
Louis bankers trying to finance this thing.

19:16.102 --> 19:20.569
In fact, Calvin left A&M at the same time I did.

19:20.589 --> 19:24.474
He went full time with this American coin meter thing.

19:27.278 --> 19:31.304
So my wife and I and our two brand new children went up and lived in St.

19:31.364 --> 19:33.167
Louis and worked in these

19:34.058 --> 19:45.330
Oh, it was slum renovation where the government would come in and build these big grand houses and we'd put coin-operated, well, I should write a book on that.

19:46.151 --> 19:52.598
Can't imagine what those people did to those places and our coin-operated laundry equipment.

19:52.618 --> 19:57.603
Well, we dealt with that a couple of years and we decided we didn't wanna make our lives in St.

19:57.663 --> 20:02.428
Louis and I came back and worked then with Roy Hegler,

20:03.860 --> 20:11.231
Over in the Ag Experiment Station at the time, I was their traveling auditor and whatnot.

20:12.272 --> 20:26.413
And let's see, Rudder came in to be president about that time and I was involved with the opening of this Stiles Farm Foundation at Thrall.

20:27.354 --> 20:32.702
Came in and then I went back and I got into an unusual situation there where I was

20:32.935 --> 20:35.640
writing letters and answering them myself.

20:36.962 --> 20:48.782
I'd come over here and write a letter for Mr. Rudder so you know about all this sort of stuff and then take the letter over there with R.E.

20:48.842 --> 20:58.639
Patterson who was dean of agriculture at the time and met with and I remember I had lunch one time with a young board member

21:00.053 --> 21:04.018
He was here for a thousand years from up at Grandview.

21:05.940 --> 21:07.121
Clyde Wells.

21:07.221 --> 21:09.744
He was just a junior board member.

21:09.764 --> 21:14.710
I remember one time over there and dealing with this thing and the lawyer was over there.

21:15.090 --> 21:22.939
But anyhow, on this letter writing thing, we'd meet with the lawyer and he'd respond to the letter that I had written for Mr. Rudder.

21:23.560 --> 21:27.085
And he's a less composed letter now.

21:27.105 --> 21:31.611
So I was writing and answering my own letters, you know, about that thing.

21:31.671 --> 21:42.907
But any of that lasted working with the Ag Experiment Station until 63 when I went with Stark over as assistant director and business manager.

21:42.927 --> 21:44.048
All right, let's reach back.

21:45.070 --> 21:49.836
Describe your impression of Earl Rudder as a person to work with.

21:52.480 --> 21:52.740
I...

21:53.429 --> 21:58.055
found him later to be someone who you could respect.

21:58.095 --> 22:02.761
When he first got here, he didn't enjoy a very good reputation.

22:02.801 --> 22:06.947
He was pretty firm and, you know, this way and that.

22:07.407 --> 22:11.673
But you came to appreciate those very virtues later.

22:11.713 --> 22:20.044
Because I can remember sitting with Wayne and I went over and talked with him for some reason or other in his office just before

22:20.969 --> 22:32.019
all this Kent State thing came about, and he was going to deal with a group of those folks coming here, and he was quite concerned about it.

22:32.059 --> 22:41.208
As a matter of fact, you may remember Alfred Tillman, who was the sound man.

22:42.209 --> 22:48.495
He and I went into Rudder's office and put in a tape recorder into Mr. Rudder's desk.

22:48.515 --> 22:50.757
Well, of course, I was just there.

22:51.310 --> 23:08.968
It was kind of along for the ride, so that if it became necessary, he could begin taping the conversation with these folks that, you know, it didn't become necessary, but he was prepared for it.

23:09.268 --> 23:15.655
Now, as far as you recall, were these A&M students, faculty, staff, or were these off-campus folks?

23:15.675 --> 23:17.757
Off-campus, off-campus folks.

23:18.682 --> 23:21.286
I've forgotten now who they were.

23:21.366 --> 23:24.071
I'm sure this is all documented somewhere, of course.

23:27.155 --> 23:36.390
I remember the ground floor of the system building, they bolted all of those shut to limit any access.

23:36.430 --> 23:40.116
This Kent State thing was still very fresh and it was a big problem.

23:40.703 --> 23:47.615
And I can remember they bolted all of those ground floor windows shut in the system building.

23:49.138 --> 23:56.390
And Mr. Rudder was concerned about this meeting, but it turned out okay.

23:56.450 --> 23:59.235
Nothing came of it and it all died.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.488
You joined Wayne Stark in 63.

24:01.508 --> 24:02.509
63.

24:05.773 --> 24:07.314
Summarize Wayne Stark.

24:07.334 --> 24:12.500
Describe Wayne Stark to somebody that has, maybe somebody that didn't know what he was.

24:12.800 --> 24:25.695
A&M will always owe Wayne Stark something for the time and devotion that he spent and to the frustration quite often of Mr. Rudder.

24:26.335 --> 24:29.779
Mr. Rudder told him one time that he had a diary of the typewriter

24:30.383 --> 24:59.057
that Wayne would write these long, long, long letters, but from a very genuine effort to accomplish something that he thought was good, this, as a matter of fact, was written up in a Texas Monthly thing that you may have read of this very relationship between Stark and Rudder that Mr. Rudder felt frustrated sometime, all these things that Wayne wanted to do because they were contrary to, you know, the

25:00.674 --> 25:06.401
an all-male school and this type thing, and Wayne was trying to drag whatever culture he could.

25:07.943 --> 25:11.387
Well, you worked with him as an advisor back there, you know.

25:12.468 --> 25:14.811
But I always respected Wayne.

25:14.891 --> 25:27.947
He tended to be a little talkative sometimes, but you had to do that to accomplish what he wanted to do, and I think Wayne got his

25:28.805 --> 25:34.755
deserved later on when they, who was it under, he was a special assistant of the whatever.

25:34.915 --> 25:38.160
What were his cherished goals?

25:38.862 --> 25:39.422
Wayne's?

25:42.067 --> 25:45.593
Well, I think to do whatever he could, now on a school basis.

25:45.713 --> 25:46.474
Yeah, that's what I mean.

25:47.836 --> 25:52.484
He had a lot of excellent goals with individual students, you know.

25:52.504 --> 25:54.407
But with the school,

25:55.130 --> 25:59.878
just to elevate the cultural standing of the school.

25:59.898 --> 26:02.021
I mean, A&M just didn't have much.

26:02.462 --> 26:05.487
Well, let's say Texas didn't have much.

26:06.489 --> 26:12.138
I don't mean the University of Texas, but the state of Texas was just lacking in a lot of these things.

26:13.200 --> 26:16.325
And Wayne just, I think, knocked himself out.

26:16.365 --> 26:21.373
All the town hall performances and whatnot that were brought here were

26:22.265 --> 26:47.462
excellent taste and he spent an awful lot of time he'd go to New York and then just before Christmas every year and spend time with the booking agents and would pick up you know these big name people always had a night off somewhere and that's when we'd get them to come here they were on their way from Houston to Dallas or something and a big thing and uh

26:48.016 --> 26:51.321
Wayne would have just worked and worked to get those things here.

26:51.421 --> 27:03.140
And then, you know, the organizational staff that he had to make this thing work here among the students, I think, was just phenomenal how he got students involved.

27:04.062 --> 27:09.551
How did he spot those bright, capable students as freshmen?

27:09.571 --> 27:11.013
Because he would get them involved early.

27:12.035 --> 27:13.196
He just had a feel.

27:13.297 --> 27:14.158
He would pick up

27:14.847 --> 27:37.598
some boy that was just off the farm somewhere you know and he had an intuition somehow would see something in that kid and just bring him out and he he sent these farm kids I mean to New York you know to meet with the

27:38.438 --> 28:04.530
Well, John Hagler over here, among others, and there's another lawyer up there, Samuelson or something, Larry Foraker, you know, he'd send these kids off to these people in these places and they would never, never would have had the opportunity if Wayne just didn't make them go.

28:04.949 --> 28:09.057
And then they were always grateful later because they would leave here.

28:09.538 --> 28:11.783
What am I doing up here?

28:12.384 --> 28:13.366
I can't do this.

28:13.907 --> 28:18.156
But invariably these people would come out shining.

28:18.176 --> 28:22.384
I remember now the concerts, the lectures,

28:23.292 --> 28:29.381
The leadership trips to Houston and Dallas, I think those were the only places you went, didn't they?

28:29.882 --> 28:30.382
Yeah, right.

28:33.847 --> 28:35.349
What were some other courses?

28:35.390 --> 28:37.753
Scona was a big thing.

28:41.959 --> 28:47.427
Let's see, not long ago I mentioned to somebody who I didn't realize how they would misunderstand

28:48.031 --> 28:55.383
And before a mixed audience, I asked somebody if he had ever gotten the green couch treatment for Mr. Sharp.

28:55.523 --> 29:02.975
And some women in the room interpreted the green couch in a different way.

29:02.995 --> 29:05.018
But that was standard lingo, wasn't it?

29:05.178 --> 29:08.503
When you get those kids in there and put them on that old... Yeah, yes, sir.

29:08.623 --> 29:09.064
Electrum.

29:09.284 --> 29:11.368
Yes, sir, rebob.

29:11.388 --> 29:13.431
He had one of the first...

29:14.828 --> 29:17.031
hands-free phones you know.

29:17.792 --> 29:38.642
He'd set that thing going and carry on a conversation with everybody in the room with some senator or somebody and you know Robert Kennedy was here one time and oh he had dealt with him in a very close way and John who's the

29:39.753 --> 29:41.455
Galbraith.

29:42.257 --> 29:43.178
John Kenneth Galbraith.

29:43.298 --> 29:46.964
Yeah, John Kenneth Galbraith was, was he an economist or what, yeah.

29:47.925 --> 29:48.606
Hard economist.

29:48.866 --> 30:03.668
And he was here, people of this nature, you know, he'd bring here and entertain them and get these kids involved in a very, I don't want to say an intimate way, but a very close relationship with these folks.

30:04.306 --> 30:11.095
And which, you know, I thought was just remarkable that they just wouldn't have done this any other way.

30:11.115 --> 30:18.023
Officially, when you joined him, Wayne Stark and the MSC reported to Dean Hannigan.

30:18.043 --> 30:19.585
Yes.

30:19.906 --> 30:22.048
Dean of Students or whatever the title was then.

30:24.051 --> 30:32.862
But in fact, the MSC related to the whole campus because I, as a faculty member, quite early got drafted to

30:33.196 --> 30:38.125
be on the advisory council or whatever it was called, and that happened to many, many others.

30:38.546 --> 30:42.252
So it involved the whole campus.

30:43.094 --> 30:48.103
As you recall those years, how well financed was the MSC?

30:49.726 --> 30:51.469
Did it have a tight budget?

30:51.970 --> 30:53.172
Pretty tight, yes.

30:53.232 --> 30:55.356
We were totally dependent on...

30:56.180 --> 31:20.533
student fees that's back when we had seven or eight thousand students and I can remember counting students one by one you know the fees were going to get now at that time we operated of course the food services in the building which we got the profits off of that and of course the hotel yeah I can remember we did the

31:21.172 --> 31:32.048
the furniture in the main lounge there, and this was a big, big deal, $49,000, you know, and this, you know, this was a big deal.

31:32.108 --> 31:36.555
Now, what was your duty, your specific task?

31:36.575 --> 31:43.325
Well, I was, the title was assistant director and business manager, mostly was the business aspect of it.

31:44.066 --> 31:46.690
In that angle, what part?
