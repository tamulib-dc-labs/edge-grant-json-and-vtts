00:02.798 --> 00:06.024
In the undergraduate pre-veterinary courses, I had girls.

00:06.084 --> 00:09.690
In fact, I started dating Martha.

00:09.730 --> 00:13.337
She was taking a course in bacteriology at the same time I was.

00:13.397 --> 00:15.741
So this is the University of Missouri.

00:15.761 --> 00:16.403
She didn't get off on that.

00:16.423 --> 00:21.572
But anyway, we started dating, and the fellow sitting next to her was never there.

00:21.612 --> 00:23.395
So I moved down there and started sitting there all the time.

00:23.415 --> 00:26.140
Well, the instructor took role every day.

00:26.592 --> 00:28.474
And I made pretty good grades.

00:28.514 --> 00:30.095
In fact, I was making 100 on the quizzes.

00:30.376 --> 00:31.937
And he'd give a quiz once a week.

00:32.397 --> 00:36.681
And he really worried how this guy who was never there could make good grades.

00:36.701 --> 00:40.665
And finally Martha said, you better go tell him someday that you're here.

00:41.126 --> 00:42.367
So I finally told him.

00:42.387 --> 00:43.107
And he was relieved.

00:43.188 --> 00:45.570
I said, gee, I thought my exams were out.

00:45.590 --> 00:46.631
Somebody stole my quizzes.

00:46.671 --> 00:47.772
And she was cheating.

00:48.573 --> 00:52.356
So anyway, but it's always used to the girls being in class.

00:52.536 --> 00:54.338
As far as teaching them, it

00:55.347 --> 01:00.594
Of course, I generally told jokes that weren't, I guess you'd call, raw jokes.

01:00.654 --> 01:08.023
In fact, the last joke I told, other than knowing myself, was about a deaf duck, and I'll never forget that.

01:08.744 --> 01:13.890
And I didn't realize it was the first day of class, one of the girls in the class was deaf.

01:14.451 --> 01:14.851
Oh.

01:14.871 --> 01:16.734
Yeah, and that really, I felt bad about that.

01:16.754 --> 01:21.460
I apologized to her, but she's been friendly to me ever since, and she was on the faculty for a long period of time.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.223
It's just one of the students told me,

01:25.199 --> 01:28.967
I can't remember her name, this is deaf, you know, it didn't.

01:29.749 --> 01:39.932
But she had somebody with carbon paper underneath their notes and she had a recording there and she had to play it to somebody else and they'd write out her notes for it that she couldn't understand.

01:40.693 --> 01:44.642
So I quit telling all kinds of jokes, whether they're deaf ducks or whatever they are.

01:44.622 --> 01:53.333
About how long, about how many years did it take before there was a meaningful number of women enrolled?

01:53.353 --> 01:54.454
Haskell, I can't remember.

01:54.475 --> 01:56.517
It's probably four or five years, I guess.

01:57.238 --> 01:58.760
I remember we had Sonia.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.502
It seemed like there wasn't one the next year.

02:00.562 --> 02:02.004
Then there were two or three.

02:02.905 --> 02:07.491
The first big class, I think it was three, and it had Big Mama Magda.

02:07.471 --> 02:12.095
Great big gals, arm wrestle with the students, and she was pretty crude.

02:13.176 --> 02:15.378
And after that, they started getting more and more.

02:16.379 --> 02:19.262
Now during that time, we had a contract with Louisiana.

02:19.783 --> 02:21.204
Right, LSU, yeah.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.325
Louisiana, yeah.

02:22.345 --> 02:26.089
And it was, what did they have, six out of 64?

02:26.149 --> 02:27.950
Something like that, right, yeah.

02:28.211 --> 02:29.512
And they were always very good students.

02:30.092 --> 02:33.095
They were always interesting students, too.

02:33.115 --> 02:36.178
They always added life to the class.

02:36.158 --> 02:38.064
And they were certainly accepted.

02:38.184 --> 02:38.766
Oh, yeah.

02:38.786 --> 02:39.167
Definitely.

02:39.348 --> 02:39.890
Definitely.

02:39.910 --> 02:50.202
Because they were sharp and there were one or two of them that went a little bit different.

02:50.755 --> 02:56.421
I've heard from one of them occasionally that although he was pretty sharp, he just wasn't very practical.

02:56.441 --> 02:58.704
He couldn't apply it and he had problems doing that.

02:59.084 --> 03:04.430
For the most part, they were very well accepted and, in fact, be class leaders to a great degree, yeah.

03:04.450 --> 03:08.094
How long before do you remember the first black students?

03:10.197 --> 03:11.738
Yeah, I remember the first black student.

03:12.519 --> 03:16.003
Oh, gosh.

03:15.983 --> 03:22.490
And he ended up in the meat inspection.

03:22.650 --> 03:23.651
He's in the USDA.

03:23.691 --> 03:30.157
In fact, last I saw he was a supervisor or a district supervisor in several states.

03:31.579 --> 03:35.342
I flunked him.

03:35.422 --> 03:36.263
I flunked him too.

03:38.686 --> 03:45.012
The dean said, well, you ought to go back and give him another exam and let him, I mean, so I gave him some material to read

03:45.363 --> 03:51.269
At the end of the next semester, I gave him another exam and he passed, but oh gosh, what's his name?

03:52.190 --> 03:53.151
He was the first black student.

03:53.171 --> 03:54.672
And he had no problems?

03:55.613 --> 03:56.474
He had no problems.

03:56.594 --> 03:57.455
He just didn't.

03:57.475 --> 04:02.239
I mean that there was nothing about his being not well received.

04:02.259 --> 04:03.240
Oh, no, no, no.

04:03.300 --> 04:03.801
Nothing about him.

04:03.821 --> 04:09.546
That's why I felt bad about flunging him, but he had a very low grade and he was, you know, even if you curve it, he'd be down low, so.

04:09.947 --> 04:10.687
All right.

04:10.707 --> 04:12.349
Your opinion.

04:12.329 --> 04:24.533
Do you think if we'd had a vote of the veterinary faculty at that time, would there have been a different vote on the admission of women or the admission of black students?

04:25.542 --> 04:28.807
By that you mean would they say yes or no?

04:30.089 --> 04:31.071
What would the faculty vote?

04:31.091 --> 04:32.974
The faculty would vote no on both of them, I think.

04:33.354 --> 04:33.755
On both?

04:33.995 --> 04:36.199
I think so, yeah.

04:36.379 --> 04:41.027
Would there have been a larger number voting no against blacks or against women?

04:41.327 --> 04:42.349
Against women.

04:42.509 --> 04:43.591
That would have been my guess.

04:44.272 --> 04:46.335
Some still were very upset.

04:46.315 --> 04:49.924
And I presume there were some Hispanic youngsters always.

04:50.084 --> 04:54.776
Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:54.796 --> 04:56.500
Some, there was some discrimination there too.

04:56.520 --> 04:57.562
I shouldn't say that, but there was.

04:58.886 --> 05:02.755
I remember one student who,

05:04.321 --> 05:07.044
One of the faculty advisors told me he'd never get into vet school.

05:07.064 --> 05:07.865
He just wanted to go home.

05:08.906 --> 05:12.631
And he came in with his mother and father, and they were little people.

05:13.051 --> 05:16.155
And somebody at home comes to me, and I talked to him.

05:16.595 --> 05:22.062
That kid got in school, vet school, and he's practiced, successful practice in El Paso.

05:23.163 --> 05:24.164
I see him every now and then.

05:24.184 --> 05:25.386
That guy makes you proud at least.

05:26.387 --> 05:29.991
But some of them are looked down on, as you well know.

05:30.359 --> 05:37.838
Now, how in those early years, how were you evaluated, what was the evaluation process for a faculty member?

05:39.944 --> 05:45.390
We didn't have any formal evaluation forms, anything like that.

05:46.331 --> 05:48.132
It's more or less, I guess, hearsay.

05:48.152 --> 05:49.914
I never received any.

05:51.296 --> 05:55.140
Dr. Jagger never called me in and said, well, you ought to do this, this, and this, or you're not doing this well enough.

05:56.601 --> 06:01.826
If you get complaints, well, he'd talk to me about it, but there was no set evaluation procedure.

06:01.846 --> 06:05.230
There was no annual review type of thing.

06:05.250 --> 06:08.213
Did he ever chat with you and give you any?

06:09.425 --> 06:11.047
Advice or counsel or tell you what?

06:11.067 --> 06:12.769
Sometimes, yeah, sometimes, you know.

06:14.111 --> 06:19.298
But I can't remember any specific incident where it was at, you know.

06:19.578 --> 06:23.743
And salary increases were, they weren't uniform, were they?

06:23.763 --> 06:24.444
No, they weren't uniform.

06:24.524 --> 06:26.166
No, they were very far apart.

06:26.207 --> 06:27.408
Is that right?

06:27.428 --> 06:27.688
Yeah.

06:28.970 --> 06:29.331
Yeah.

06:29.351 --> 06:32.074
How did you feel you were being treated?

06:32.527 --> 06:35.090
on salaries and promotions?

06:36.452 --> 06:42.118
For quite a while, I felt like maybe not too well, yeah, not too well.

06:42.138 --> 06:43.700
And then when did that change, you said?

06:44.241 --> 06:54.012
That changed probably, I know it changed after,

06:54.970 --> 07:03.298
After Dr. Jaggi retired, Dr. Flowers was a little bit more free, and then Dr. Hydeball was probably the best of all for changing salaries.

07:03.318 --> 07:05.380
But it was fairly, fairly, fairly slow.

07:07.202 --> 07:23.577
And as far as you were aware, were in terms of your promotion and your salary, were you being, keeping pace with others of your, your similar colleagues?

07:24.080 --> 07:25.122
You mean at other schools?

07:25.142 --> 07:25.663
No, no, no.

07:25.763 --> 07:26.063
Oh, here?

07:27.025 --> 07:31.532
No, it's obvious some departments are very, very much better treated, yeah, yeah.

07:33.115 --> 07:33.836
The word gets out.

07:34.177 --> 07:34.457
Okay.

07:34.477 --> 07:36.921
And, of course, they used to publish the book, put it over in the library.

07:36.941 --> 07:37.903
Oh, yeah, that's right.

07:37.923 --> 07:40.407
And every now and then people said, you ought to go and look the book.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.569
Now, I regret it.

07:41.589 --> 07:44.113
I ever went to look the thing I did and it makes you.

07:44.718 --> 07:49.824
A little bit upset, but there were certain departments, department heads were much more effective in getting the money.

07:49.844 --> 08:01.597
In terms of grading, those of us across the tracks, we in that era, we put our grades on the door of our office and students would come by and look.

08:02.098 --> 08:03.599
Did you all post grades over here?

08:03.619 --> 08:05.201
No, no.

08:05.221 --> 08:08.144
Not that way.

08:08.264 --> 08:11.468
So, and did you ever?

08:12.292 --> 08:13.133
Go ahead.

08:13.153 --> 08:17.057
I was going to say, did the students give you a nickname or give your courses a nickname?

08:18.258 --> 08:20.921
They probably did, but I ignored it.

08:20.941 --> 08:21.962
But you didn't know what it was?

08:22.022 --> 08:22.262
No.

08:22.883 --> 08:23.724
Okay.

08:24.364 --> 08:37.038
When did this trimester system, it was in effect in the 60s and up into the 70s, when did the class size increase?

08:37.818 --> 08:39.480
Class size increased.

08:40.540 --> 08:48.191
When subvention rates went in, federal subvention rates and Haskell, I can't remember the exact time, but they went up fairly quick.

08:48.211 --> 08:49.773
Was it under Dean Price?

08:49.873 --> 08:50.474
Yes.

08:50.494 --> 08:51.295
It was.

08:51.436 --> 08:52.377
Yeah, yeah.

08:52.657 --> 09:00.709
Went up to 96 and 128 and then we got about 132 for a while.

09:00.689 --> 09:05.036
You were a while ago mentioned Mr. Rutter.

09:05.196 --> 09:16.055
What did you and your colleagues, what do you think was the typical opinion of the School of Veterinary Medicine to the leadership across the tracks?

09:16.075 --> 09:18.158
What do you think they thought of Mr. Rutter?

09:18.678 --> 09:20.220
And over here what they thought of Rudder?

09:20.440 --> 09:22.243
I think they pretty well respect him.

09:22.283 --> 09:25.748
They knew he was, they feared him too.

09:26.809 --> 09:28.691
Did he come over here to visit some?

09:28.712 --> 09:31.235
No, I never remember him coming over here to visit.

09:31.255 --> 09:32.917
I never heard of it.

09:32.937 --> 09:33.238
Uh-huh, no.

09:34.239 --> 09:37.343
And did you all see much of Vice President Wayne Hall?

09:38.865 --> 09:41.268
Some occasionally, yeah, some occasionally.

09:41.489 --> 09:46.896
But it was more like just walking around campus than here, yeah.

09:46.876 --> 09:50.421
We called them Water Closets, is that right?

09:51.844 --> 09:52.905
That's right.

09:53.466 --> 09:55.089
That's right.

09:55.529 --> 09:56.831
That was a nickname for him.

10:00.076 --> 10:05.104
Do you remember any reaction when you heard that Mr. Rutter had died?

10:05.658 --> 10:10.324
I thought there was a lot of sad people that we had lost a good fighter, a good leader.

10:11.366 --> 10:12.807
And then Jack Williams.

10:13.729 --> 10:18.174
Jack Williams, there was mixed reactions to him and I don't know why.

10:18.875 --> 10:27.367
He seemed always, you know, when you see him in fact to me, he seemed always very straightforward and very, you know, cordial.

10:29.529 --> 10:35.277
I guess maybe he didn't seem to be as outspoken and as,

10:36.691 --> 10:40.094
I don't want to say tough, you might say, as Errol Rudder.

10:40.174 --> 10:40.835
I guess that's it.

10:41.315 --> 10:43.157
I know some people didn't think much of him.

10:43.237 --> 10:43.878
I don't know why.

10:44.298 --> 10:45.219
I liked him.

10:45.859 --> 10:46.120
All right.

10:46.140 --> 10:50.524
Now, he's the one that made the decision on women's dorms and all that.

10:50.544 --> 10:50.644
Yeah.

10:50.944 --> 10:52.926
And the enrollment really begins to grow.

10:53.206 --> 10:53.627
Yeah.

10:55.048 --> 10:59.412
Did you all begin to think that veterinary medicine, the College of Veterinary Medicine, was making progress?

11:00.313 --> 11:01.654
At that time, probably not, no.

11:01.954 --> 11:02.435
Yeah.

11:02.455 --> 11:02.695
Really?

11:02.855 --> 11:04.677
Yeah.

11:04.737 --> 11:06.158
I'm trying to put it in perspective.

11:06.762 --> 11:09.225
See, he gets here in November of 70.

11:09.505 --> 11:14.070
Okay.

11:14.670 --> 11:15.591
Sorry, I can't think.

11:18.234 --> 11:22.239
By that time, did you feel pretty deeply rooted here?

11:22.359 --> 11:24.181
Did you think about going elsewhere?

11:24.201 --> 11:25.202
70?

11:26.183 --> 11:31.909
Yeah, I thought about going elsewhere.

11:34.538 --> 11:36.863
I've been given some offers other places.

11:38.847 --> 11:47.945
By the time I interviewed up at Kansas State, and Martha I don't think really wanted to leave.

11:47.985 --> 11:49.167
She liked it here.

11:50.850 --> 11:56.682
But they offered me a position up there, but it ended up I'd have to

11:58.012 --> 12:00.536
my salary would have to be cut to go up there.

12:00.556 --> 12:01.998
They were in worse shape than we were, so.

12:02.979 --> 12:11.272
I told them I had to have the same salary and moving expenses if the, and the, so it never worked out, yeah.

12:12.413 --> 12:17.621
And were you beginning to feel relatively comfortable here?

12:17.641 --> 12:19.564
Yeah, pretty much so, yeah, yeah.

12:20.705 --> 12:24.832
Whom did, who, did you have a close friend in those early years, a close?

12:25.953 --> 12:27.175
Yeah, well,

12:27.678 --> 12:29.421
Tom Galvin lived down the street from us.

12:29.962 --> 12:32.305
He was in parasitology and we were fairly close.

12:32.325 --> 12:36.031
We would ride together to work and share cars.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.695
Each family just had one car so we'd do that.

12:39.477 --> 12:49.112
And he had gone to Tulane for graduate school so we had some common friends and knowledge and this type of thing.

12:49.970 --> 12:57.565
All right, and now let's talk about off-campus life for you and the family at that time.

12:57.625 --> 12:59.889
You all took vacations where or when?

13:00.711 --> 13:06.983
Our vacations were generally with the, that time we always had to go see the grandparents, of course, in Missouri.

13:08.414 --> 13:17.025
And then I guess 65 I started going to AVMA conventions, so Martha I don't think went with me until about 70 I guess.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.769
We used to take, you know, kids when we couldn't go.

13:19.849 --> 13:21.872
And they would be held different places across.

13:21.892 --> 13:22.953
Yeah, different places throughout the country.

13:23.534 --> 13:29.462
So as far as true vacations, we never took any where you went just, you know, off to go somewhere like Yellowstone.

13:29.502 --> 13:35.710
We went, you know, go see the grandparents or go to AVMA conventions and Martha go with me.

13:35.730 --> 13:37.172
That was it.

13:37.152 --> 13:42.558
And the kids got involved in what extracurricular activities that involved mom and dad?

13:44.300 --> 13:45.161
That's a good question.

13:48.324 --> 13:49.866
Little league, piano lessons?

13:49.886 --> 13:51.127
Yeah, little league, yeah.

13:51.147 --> 13:52.529
Little league, piano one.

13:52.709 --> 13:54.090
Brian took piano lessons.

13:55.552 --> 14:00.257
We both got a little bit in tennis for a while.

14:01.722 --> 14:05.587
Curtis Little League, that type of thing.

14:05.607 --> 14:07.629
All right, and they're in the Bryan School District?

14:07.750 --> 14:09.372
Yeah, they're in the Bryan School District, yes.

14:09.852 --> 14:17.282
And then at church, well, not yet Sunday night youth activities.

14:17.302 --> 14:18.103
No, I don't think so.

14:18.323 --> 14:18.964
Okay.

14:18.984 --> 14:21.587
I don't remember much about youth activities Sunday night.

14:21.607 --> 14:22.488
We didn't have much then.

14:22.969 --> 14:28.776
What led you to get to going regularly to the AVMA?

14:28.756 --> 14:36.873
Just the fact you needed the best way to keep up on most recent knowledge, most recent science.

14:36.933 --> 14:44.549
Did you develop some close relationships with some professionals at other places that were working on similar?

14:44.890 --> 14:45.752
Right.

14:45.732 --> 14:47.975
Also, there's other meetings I would attend.

14:48.176 --> 14:50.319
There's one for teachers of food safety.

14:51.661 --> 14:55.386
The USDA generally sponsored that once a year in Chicago, so you got to know people through that.

14:55.686 --> 15:00.413
And it was always about how to teach various things.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.438
Also, I'd go to meetings at CDC occasionally.

15:03.458 --> 15:06.542
They'd have programs there on epidemiology and on

15:06.522 --> 15:14.280
In fact, diseases are public health important, so you get to know people in your particular category that way.

15:14.320 --> 15:22.860
So primarily, I guess, going to governmental sponsored meetings and learning more about various things you can use in teaching.

15:23.650 --> 15:29.400
In that era, did y'all have to pay your own transportation cost or did we?

15:29.420 --> 15:30.562
Pretty much so, yeah.

15:30.602 --> 15:32.465
We didn't have hardly any travel funds here, yeah.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.811
What about research startup money?

15:35.831 --> 15:42.142
I think it was hard to come by, really, research money at that time, yeah.

15:42.703 --> 15:48.713
So that y'all didn't have the same access to ag experiment station money?

15:49.115 --> 15:56.165
We did, but you had to be on Ag Experiment Station staff to do that, and I stayed full-time teaching, so.

15:56.265 --> 15:56.866
Oh, okay.

15:56.886 --> 15:57.267
Okay.

15:58.008 --> 15:58.609
For how long?

15:59.130 --> 16:02.815
I always have, never been on Experiment Station, yeah, yeah.

16:04.037 --> 16:08.704
Nev Clark came in about that time, so I, another reason not to, I shouldn't say that.

16:09.445 --> 16:13.250
I like Nev, but a lot of people really had some poor experiences.

16:13.371 --> 16:16.455
It demanded a lot of time.

16:16.435 --> 16:20.219
I felt like by teaching at first, I did do some research, did get some research grants.

16:23.202 --> 16:26.245
Through the one that, I can't remember, Tetrap.

16:26.946 --> 16:31.530
If you remember that, the competitive one in the state of Texas, I got a big grant from them on rabies.

16:31.931 --> 16:32.852
That's my biggest grant.

16:33.893 --> 16:38.317
Got 310,000 from 1985, I guess.

16:40.119 --> 16:42.882
And I got 100,000 from the Army.

16:44.110 --> 16:48.996
and another 100,000 state health department after that to research grants.

16:49.497 --> 16:52.240
Describe those research projects in layman's language.

16:52.260 --> 16:52.981
Okay.

16:53.061 --> 17:01.051
The big one was primarily to, in fact it was, to develop an anemortem diagnostic test in dogs.

17:02.032 --> 17:08.920
By that I mean a test where you take a blood sample and tell whether they had been exposed to rabies or not.

17:10.722 --> 17:14.935
And now the only way you can tell is you euthanize them and examine the brain.

17:15.757 --> 17:20.211
And so that's what I got a grant to do.

17:20.953 --> 17:23.521
And the test worked out pretty good.

17:23.541 --> 17:24.343
The only problem is

17:24.779 --> 17:30.390
There's several strains of rabies virus, and I did the one that's actually caused the coyote problem in South Texas.

17:30.470 --> 17:33.436
That problem then was the Mexican, Mexico City virus.

17:33.456 --> 17:34.257
It was the hottest one.

17:34.959 --> 17:40.710
And we could tell about three or four days before the animals came down with any clinical science, they had a rabies virus.

17:40.730 --> 17:42.754
And you could differentiate

17:42.734 --> 17:47.344
whether it was due to wild virus, their blood reaction or vaccination titer.

17:47.364 --> 17:49.609
So we worked that out, worked out pretty good.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.653
Now that project lasted how long?

17:51.934 --> 17:53.157
That lasted three years.

17:53.357 --> 17:53.818
Three years?

17:53.838 --> 17:54.379
Yeah.

17:54.399 --> 17:56.624
And you and how many students?

17:56.644 --> 17:59.410
I had one, two, three,

18:00.892 --> 18:04.156
Four, four students I think, four students.

18:04.176 --> 18:05.878
One Ph.D., two Ph.D.

18:06.558 --> 18:07.459
and two masters.

18:09.442 --> 18:13.126
And when did you first start directing graduate students?

18:14.407 --> 18:18.972
Gosh, Haskell came here, I guess 66 probably after I got my Ph.D.

18:19.233 --> 18:21.776
and started doing a few small projects.

18:21.796 --> 18:23.878
I had small projects.

18:23.858 --> 18:48.297
Had one, you get some funds, there'd be always some local funds, not big amounts, but Dr. Dalai, I remember Dr. James Dalai, a toxicologist, he called me one night, one Sunday night, that the child had eaten some poisonous plant berries, centipberries, if I remember correctly.

18:49.795 --> 18:55.421
And she was in the poison center down at Galveston, wanted to know would that particular barrier cause any problems.

18:55.441 --> 18:57.423
And he said, I couldn't find anything in literature where it would.

18:57.503 --> 18:58.904
So he said, would you look in the literature?

18:58.944 --> 19:00.045
So I looked all through the literature.

19:01.146 --> 19:02.127
I couldn't find anything.

19:02.788 --> 19:08.354
And the problem was that this young child had a very high blood glucose level.

19:09.014 --> 19:15.080
So they didn't know whether this would precipitate diabetes or this was a clinical sign of diabetes, I mean clinical sign of the poisoning.

19:15.461 --> 19:17.923
And we could find nothing in there that indicated it would be.

19:17.963 --> 19:19.785
So they treated it as a diabetic.

19:20.272 --> 19:29.100
But that problem with these particular berries, coyotea, these coyotea berries, are they indeed poisonous?

19:29.120 --> 19:29.860
They're very common.

19:30.721 --> 19:34.564
So I turned in, Grant got some funding.

19:37.087 --> 19:38.188
Maybe that came to the Experiment Station.

19:38.208 --> 19:38.668
I guess I did.

19:38.688 --> 19:40.930
I have to go back with my word.

19:40.970 --> 19:49.097
They gave me some Experiment Station money to experiment in monkeys, get some subhuman primates and feed them the berries and see what happens.

19:49.482 --> 19:51.708
I got some capuchin monkeys.

19:51.909 --> 19:59.611
They looked around, and a rhesus monkey was a standard monkey, but they're big and they're vicious, so somewhere told me, get capuchin monkeys.

19:59.631 --> 20:00.854
That's the organ grinder monkeys.

20:00.874 --> 20:03.562
So I got, I think, 15 of those.

20:04.344 --> 20:04.926
Got them.

20:04.906 --> 20:11.096
And we started studies on those and did show what the coyotea berry would do.

20:11.136 --> 20:14.342
Did all kinds of neurological studies on them.

20:15.323 --> 20:24.298
Some people of physiology wrote some papers on the effect upon the heart, various other things, brain tissue.

20:24.413 --> 20:30.141
As far as the pathology, I worked out a thing with the medical school over in San Antonio.

20:30.201 --> 20:34.667
They'd do some pathology and compare it to human pathology and it worked out real good.

20:35.668 --> 20:43.639
The only problem is I had some monkeys out there and they started breeding and started having young monkeys and we had a big gang cage.

20:43.659 --> 20:49.206
And to make a long story short, we started looking around and we found no one could reproduce those in captivity.

20:50.857 --> 20:51.458
Kind of weird.

20:52.059 --> 20:55.564
So they said it's more valuable to show you can reproduce these monkeys and why they're reproducing.

20:55.584 --> 20:59.530
Anyway, that's kind of an ironic thing.

20:59.550 --> 21:04.397
So we quit the toxicology studies and started doing reproductive studies.

21:04.898 --> 21:12.730
And I had one grad student did his work on, two grad students did reproductive studies on those, got their masters on that.

21:12.710 --> 21:17.596
One of them in town is still selling animal cages, research animal cages.

21:17.616 --> 21:23.865
He got involved, went to work for a research company that makes cages afterwards for monkeys and then one thing led to the next.

21:23.905 --> 21:29.092
The other went lab trying on medicine, went back to Ohio and he passed away a couple years ago.

21:29.232 --> 21:31.375
But it's kind of ironic.

21:31.395 --> 21:39.966
He went from toxic cause to the reproductive science and we did, were able to reproduce them fairly handily in captivity so what that's worth.

21:40.891 --> 21:47.522
And did you, during the 70s, 80s, and 90s, you had research going all the time?

21:47.622 --> 21:49.205
Yeah, I had some going all the time, yeah, yeah.

21:49.225 --> 21:50.447
Did you have funding all the time?

21:51.148 --> 21:53.512
I had some funding, yeah, yeah, funding, yeah.

21:53.532 --> 21:54.895
It wasn't big funding.

21:54.915 --> 21:58.180
Normally, about how many graduate students would you be directing?

21:59.162 --> 22:00.925
Oh, it varied from,

22:01.748 --> 22:03.570
About two or three I guess, yeah.

22:03.590 --> 22:08.595
Have you, do you have a count of how many masters and PhDs?

22:09.116 --> 22:11.058
I have it somewhere, Haskell.

22:11.378 --> 22:13.320
What would be a general guess?

22:14.922 --> 22:21.589
I'd say 30, 35 masters, probably five PhDs.

22:21.649 --> 22:22.891
I'm trying to think, PhDs.

22:24.793 --> 22:27.135
Probably that, yeah, I guess.

22:27.796 --> 22:28.937
Pure rough guess.

22:29.356 --> 22:32.622
Now how, and how would you and those students link up?

22:32.682 --> 22:35.707
How did you, did they come to you or did you?

22:35.727 --> 22:36.769
They'd come to me, yeah.

22:36.789 --> 22:36.889
Okay.

22:36.909 --> 22:38.272
Yeah.

22:38.292 --> 22:40.075
Can I tell you a story about the first one I had?

22:40.215 --> 22:40.996
Oh please, sure.

22:41.137 --> 22:43.140
The first story was Suzanne Tucheton.

22:44.883 --> 22:47.147
And I'm trying to recall how she came here.

22:47.187 --> 22:52.697
She came here, she wrote and wanted to do a graduate degree on epidemiology.

22:54.112 --> 23:00.258
At that time, we had a doctor's in public health, so I said, well, you can come to a doctor of public and veterinary public health.

23:02.400 --> 23:03.061
She came here.

23:03.442 --> 23:04.182
She's from Iran.

23:04.603 --> 23:05.163
Iran.

23:05.183 --> 23:06.665
This is when the Shah was still in power.

23:06.745 --> 23:08.387
And she had done her degrees where?

23:08.787 --> 23:09.428
In Iran.

23:09.508 --> 23:09.868
In Iran.

23:10.168 --> 23:10.809
Okay.

23:10.829 --> 23:12.671
Now, she was probably, she was already here.

23:13.652 --> 23:18.617
Her husband was getting a degree in economics on campus.

23:18.597 --> 23:23.763
He got his degree and he left and went to teach at Appalachian State.

23:24.664 --> 23:26.586
She stayed on and got her degree, PhD.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.928
I remember my first PhD student.

23:28.948 --> 23:43.845
And we did an epidemiological study on the effect of calcium-sodium ratio in water supplies, municipal water supplies on the coronary heart death rate.

23:45.445 --> 23:50.671
And we did show in the relationship, the higher the sodium to calcium ratio, the higher the death rate.

23:51.272 --> 23:56.018
And we found, it was interesting where we found various parts of the state and you could measure it.

23:56.038 --> 23:58.080
That was her PhD and I thought it was a beautiful PhD.

23:59.602 --> 24:03.146
She left, her husband and her wanted to go back to Iran.

24:03.687 --> 24:06.190
That's about the time that Shaw was disposed of.

24:07.672 --> 24:12.077
Her father was a general in the Shaw's army.

24:14.048 --> 24:15.870
And her husband had similar connections.

24:17.131 --> 24:19.213
And they went back and she says, don't write to me.

24:19.233 --> 24:20.394
I'll write to you when we can.

24:20.474 --> 24:21.555
Because she knew it was going to be tough.

24:23.076 --> 24:28.941
She went back and that was 20, I guess about 22 years ago.

24:29.782 --> 24:34.867
We got a phone call last month from San Francisco.

24:35.447 --> 24:35.888
It was her.

24:37.069 --> 24:38.690
And she didn't know we were still alive.

24:39.391 --> 24:42.874
I kept trying to get in touch with everybody I'd see had been in Iran.

24:42.854 --> 24:45.519
or had moved from there, do you know her?

24:45.659 --> 24:48.345
One or two people knew of her, but they didn't know if she was still alive or not.

24:48.365 --> 24:52.072
We thought she was dead because of her family connections, plus she was educated.

24:53.274 --> 24:58.905
Anyway, she called us last month, and her daughter, who was about this high when she left her, was about three years old,

24:58.885 --> 25:06.056
four years old, has a job in San Francisco and she's there visiting her daughter.

25:06.416 --> 25:10.603
She teaches in a medical school in Tehran, which I thought was ironic.

25:10.623 --> 25:17.513
She's going to try to come back next year and we'll see her, but that's kind of a... Now, I'm assuming this lady was a Muslim.

25:17.894 --> 25:18.955
Yeah, definitely.

25:18.976 --> 25:21.319
Did you run into any problems?

25:21.339 --> 25:21.940
Oh, gosh.

25:22.392 --> 25:23.356
Give some examples.

25:23.377 --> 25:23.718
Okay.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.587
She came to me one day crying.

25:26.370 --> 25:28.199
She graduated crying.

25:28.219 --> 25:29.525
She said, what are you crying about, Suzanne?

25:29.927 --> 25:31.474
She said, I touched a dog.

25:31.775 --> 25:32.356
What do you mean?

25:32.957 --> 25:34.259
She had to take a toxicology course.

25:34.299 --> 25:42.492
I put her in Dr. Bailey's, Merle Bailey's basic graduate toxicology class, and one of the things they do in there is study the effect of various toxins like strychnine on dogs.

25:43.013 --> 25:49.443
She'd never touched a dog in her whole life, and she had to touch this dog and the things around it, and she, it broke her down.

25:49.503 --> 25:54.331
She just cried like mad, and things like that.

25:54.411 --> 25:58.558
Of course, the food she, you know, we had them out to eat,

25:58.792 --> 26:02.157
Had to make sure there wasn't any pork or anything like that in their foods.

26:02.177 --> 26:03.859
It was very interesting.

26:04.760 --> 26:06.783
What about the way she dressed?

26:06.963 --> 26:10.989
How could she... She dressed very continental, very American.

26:11.770 --> 26:12.531
She was worried about that.

26:12.551 --> 26:17.037
She was afraid somebody from over there are going to see me, they're going to report me.

26:17.017 --> 26:21.606
because I'm not wearing my usual habit, whatever you call it.

26:22.287 --> 26:26.876
And she was worried about that when she went back, that she'd be seen wearing those American dresses.

26:28.199 --> 26:29.742
And her capability.

26:30.123 --> 26:30.564
Very good.

26:31.024 --> 26:32.848
Very good.

26:34.415 --> 26:41.103
Many things with dogs and things, associated dogs and pork, things like that.

26:41.463 --> 26:47.250
I did not know that they could, that a woman could not, a Muslim woman, were there any other animals she could not touch?

26:48.191 --> 26:51.855
I think I saw them, but the dog, she'd never touched a dog in her whole life and she broke down.

26:51.875 --> 26:56.440
She really, and she had to handle this dog in the lab and apparently she started crying and she ran down here.

26:56.420 --> 26:58.664
I still remember coming in.

26:59.025 --> 27:05.537
Do you remember any other personal realities with a graduate student?

27:05.557 --> 27:05.938
Oh, yeah.

27:06.720 --> 27:09.585
I can't stop and think.

27:12.911 --> 27:13.753
There's a lot of them.

27:14.037 --> 27:15.822
None got in trouble with the law.

27:15.923 --> 27:16.966
None you had to bail out.

27:17.086 --> 27:17.648
No, no.

27:18.009 --> 27:20.817
Believe it or not.

27:22.643 --> 27:26.594
None walked away right when they were almost completed.

27:26.614 --> 27:27.878
None walked off.

27:28.094 --> 27:29.456
Yeah, I've lost two or three.

27:29.476 --> 27:39.932
We had one fellow from Taiwan, one from Taiwan that came in here, we had him here for a year and he just vanished, disappeared.

27:41.254 --> 27:49.045
And he's a veterinarian and I heard about a year later that he went to Canada and somehow he got back to California and he was practicing out there.

27:49.085 --> 27:52.050
But he just decided one day he would, and just left.

27:53.772 --> 27:57.578
I had one very interesting graduate student from,

27:59.043 --> 28:02.151
He's from Iraq, he's Iraqi, he's a Kurd.

28:02.823 --> 28:12.378
And he showed up there and he'd been over in animal science and I don't know what happened, but he wanted to get a master's degree.

28:14.021 --> 28:16.385
And anyway, I got to talk to him, so I said, I have to get a degree.

28:16.525 --> 28:18.167
I need a degree to stay here in the States.

28:18.187 --> 28:19.189
I said, well, if I can't you go home?

28:19.209 --> 28:23.736
He said, I'll go home, I'll be killed because Iraqis and Kurds, of course.

28:25.840 --> 28:30.467
He had a hard time and he gave, had the troubles I had with him, he,

28:31.173 --> 28:37.023
had a very condescending attitude towards women.

28:37.043 --> 28:41.010
I mean, he'd talk very terrible to the secretaries and technicians.

28:41.511 --> 28:44.797
He never realized, you know, the difference, because he hadn't been here long.

28:46.620 --> 28:48.784
But he struggled when he finally graduated.

28:49.164 --> 28:51.889
And I saw him not long ago at the HEV parking lot.

28:52.450 --> 28:53.732
So he's still around here somewhere.

28:54.694 --> 28:56.016
And I had another graduate student.

28:57.245 --> 29:09.393
that CDC Centers for Disease Control in North Atlanta, George Baer who was their guru on rabies, this is when I had my rabies project, I told him I need somebody to grow the rabies virus.

29:10.215 --> 29:12.881
And I looked all over the country, I can't find anybody that wants to even touch it.

29:13.643 --> 29:15.186
He says I know a lab in China.

29:16.111 --> 29:17.453
And he got to touch somebody.

29:18.034 --> 29:22.600
Well, next thing you know, I had a student, a potential graduate from China come here.

29:23.702 --> 29:27.227
And he, and finally we got everything arranged.

29:27.347 --> 29:30.772
He came and I went down to pick him up at the airport in Houston.

29:30.792 --> 29:33.396
It was one of those real gully washers.

29:33.436 --> 29:36.701
I mean, it, the streets were flooded up the curbs.

29:37.902 --> 29:41.848
I found out when he got in the car, he'd never been in an automobile before.

29:41.828 --> 29:44.190
First time we'd been in Albuquerque.

29:44.210 --> 29:47.093
We had to drive on the sidewalk to get out down there.

29:47.214 --> 29:47.774
It was so bad.

29:49.095 --> 29:53.660
I looked over him a time or two, you know, as I could have covered my eyes, and he'd tell, he was just as fearful as could be.

29:54.681 --> 29:55.482
We came back here.

29:55.522 --> 29:58.045
About two weeks later, I was talking to him.

29:58.805 --> 30:00.747
I asked him something about how you're going to get there.

30:00.767 --> 30:01.668
I said, I'll drive.

30:02.349 --> 30:02.970
I said, drive?

30:03.030 --> 30:03.470
What do you mean?

30:04.111 --> 30:06.233
In that two-week period of time, he bought a car.

30:07.141 --> 30:08.302
I tell him, where's your driver's license?

30:08.322 --> 30:11.385
My friends say you learn to drive, then get your driver's license.

30:11.405 --> 30:17.571
So he bought a big old car and drive around town here, learned how to drive, and didn't have a driver's license.

30:17.591 --> 30:20.614
So I thought he was going to end up in jail, but he survived.

30:22.095 --> 30:25.078
He stayed with me two years, and then he disappeared.

30:25.919 --> 30:27.780
And come find out, he went over to nuclear engineering.

30:27.800 --> 30:30.463
He went in there as a graduate student and got a PhD in nuclear engineering.

30:32.365 --> 30:35.848
It's kind of scary, but he was a sharp kid.

30:36.284 --> 30:48.220
As you think about all of your master's and doctoral students now, I'm not going to ask the negative, the few that you're most proud to claim, where are they?

30:48.340 --> 30:49.722
Who are they and where are they?

30:49.742 --> 30:56.250
Most proud would be one, Charlie Pixley, who got his PhD working on my rabies project.

30:56.230 --> 30:58.793
He is in San Antonio now.

30:58.953 --> 31:07.402
He's a full colonel, very responsible, charged the laboratories over there, the health science laboratories.

31:07.562 --> 31:08.443
He's doing very well.

31:08.763 --> 31:09.604
With the Army?

31:09.744 --> 31:10.225
Yes, Army.

31:10.305 --> 31:11.146
Yes, Army.

31:11.446 --> 31:12.607
Doing a great job.

31:14.749 --> 31:15.770
I've got some master's students.

31:15.870 --> 31:22.137
One master's student had been, got his bachelor's degree here and I think

31:23.872 --> 31:24.896
Pretty sure as liberal arts.

31:24.916 --> 31:26.963
Anyway, he went to the Army, came back, wanted to go to vet school.

31:29.070 --> 31:31.519
He went through graduate school, got a master's.
