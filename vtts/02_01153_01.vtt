WEBVTT

00:01.550 --> 00:04.034
and how you came to be, maybe. My full name is Eugene 
Thomas Skidmore. And very few people in this state

00:08.120 --> 00:10.783
know that. And most all of the veterinarians know 
me as Zeke. It's a nickname I came by when I was in

00:15.791 --> 00:22.280
high school, and it went all the way through 
college, and it's still with me. The only people

00:23.141 --> 00:27.287
that call me Eugene are people that do not know me. 
They call me on the phone trying to sell me

00:27.628 --> 00:29.751
something. And you're immediately on alert. Or my 
immediately family, and they call me Gene. That is

00:35.611 --> 00:37.974
family on my side of the family. The rest of them 
don't, but I was born in the Depression, and my

00:39.396 --> 00:49.870
father died about four months before I was born, so 
I was raised by a widow woman. And we moved to Texas

00:49.890 --> 00:51.953
in 1940. So you were not born in Texas? No, I was born 
in Des Moines, Iowa. Oh, okay. And we moved to Texas

00:57.575 --> 01:01.941
in 1943.

01:02.862 --> 01:07.288
And had my 11th birthday the day after we arrived. I 
went to finish elementary school and high school

01:07.308 --> 01:15.278
in El Paso, Texas. Graduated from El Paso High 
School in 1950 and entered Texas A&M the same year.

01:23.029 --> 01:24.371
How did you get to Texas A&M? On the train. No, I 
mean, I had a long train ride, too, wasn't it? Yeah,

01:29.972 --> 01:31.534
it was. The reason I went to Texas A&M is that along 
in the middle of my high school career, I knew that I

01:31.554 --> 01:38.741
wanted to work with horses. Being a family of very, 
very modest means, there's no way that I was ever

01:40.483 --> 01:54.177
going to be able to work on horses of my own, and I 
thought it would be a very good way to make a living,

01:40.483 --> 01:54.177
be working on somebody else's animals, and the 
best way I could think of was to go to vet school. Did

01:55.085 --> 01:57.027
you have a horse? No, I had plenty to ride. I was 
fortunate that there was quite a few people in the

01:59.889 --> 02:17.486
area that had lots of money and they had horses and 
they didn't have time to ride them and they paid me

01:59.889 --> 02:17.486
to ride them and I trained their horses to where I 
could rope off of and so I had plenty of horses to

01:59.889 --> 02:17.486
rope from. In those days nobody had trailers, at 
least us kids didn't have trailers and we would get

02:22.979 --> 02:28.204
up Sunday morning and go to a rope and it'd be twenty 
miles away and ride a horse and lead three. And we

02:29.004 --> 02:34.249
got there, we'd have a fresh horse to rope on and 
have something to come back on. And you were a

02:34.530 --> 02:35.390
cowboy. No, I was a roper. Okay, okay. But I 
investigated and found the only place that I could

02:40.075 --> 02:46.540
go to vet school in the state was in Texas A&M. I 
said, well, here I come. So you really knew what you

02:47.661 --> 02:49.523
were going to do? I knew what I wanted to do. I 
enrolled at A&M, and they issued me a uniform, and

02:52.510 --> 03:01.999
some guy ran up to me and says, hey, you got to call 
all these guys sir and all that. I said, that's a

03:02.019 --> 03:03.120
bunch of bull. I didn't know anything about Texas 
A&M. I didn't know anything about Texas A&M, and I

03:06.723 --> 03:19.554
was in for a shock, and I became gung-ho like most 
everybody else does in Aggie in the Corps, and I

03:06.723 --> 03:19.554
went along with it, and I think it's one of the best 
things that ever happened. I hate to see the Corps

03:19.574 --> 03:21.336
go downhill, But with that many students, it's got 
two, and it's coed now. But I interviewed to get

03:25.783 --> 03:35.436
into vet school after I finished my two years of 
pre-vet, or during my two years of pre-vet. And I

03:36.618 --> 03:41.565
had an interview with the dean once before that. 
And my sophomore year in pre-vet, I made an F in

03:42.947 --> 03:51.559
chemistry at midterm. On my second major quiz, I 
froze. And it's about five minutes before the end

03:58.310 --> 04:02.815
of the class before I even got my name spelled 
right. And I heard through the test, missing all

04:03.956 --> 04:08.621
kinds of subscripts and everything. I made 50 on 
it, and I ended up with a- That's pretty good. Oh, I

04:11.084 --> 04:11.585
thought so. That was pretty good, considering- I 
thought so. And anyway, I ended up with the- 69

04:19.906 --> 04:21.688
average in the course. And at that time, 70 was 
passing. And everybody that was failing the

04:25.332 --> 04:29.097
course had to go see the dean. And the dean at that 
time of the veterinary college was Dr. Boughton.

04:34.884 --> 04:39.509
And all the rumors about him, that was a mean man. 
And he had just gotten out of the hospital. He'd had

04:41.551 --> 04:42.252
a stroke. And he had a cane that he walked with. And 
he swung that cane. And he cussed. And he banged the

04:46.978 --> 04:48.900
desk and all of that. So I arrived at his office when 
I was assigned to, and he sent me down in there, and

04:50.078 --> 05:00.228
he says, boy, what's the matter with you? I started 
saying, shut up. He says, your grades are awful. I

05:06.594 --> 05:10.898
said, but sir, he says, what about this trig grade? 
I had a 100 average in trig, and I said, sir, shut up.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.626
He says, what about your physics grade? I said, 
sir, I had a Ninety-nine something, and he asked

05:20.993 --> 05:23.777
me, shut up! What about this chemistry? I think 
I'd, shut up! And he read all these things, and he

05:28.724 --> 05:31.909
kept telling me to shut up. And he finally says, 
okay, now, he says, you just wanted to talk, says,

05:33.190 --> 05:40.120
what, what do you got to say for yourself? I says, 
sir? I thought 100 average was about as good as you

05:42.661 --> 05:45.225
could do in trig. And 99-something in physics was 
not so bad. And I went down to him, and I got the

05:48.910 --> 05:50.492
chemistry. And I said, I got a 69 in chemistry. And I 
says, I think I can bring that up to a B. And he looked

05:56.421 --> 05:58.985
at me, and he says, what's your name? And I told him, 
he says, oh, God. And he pulled me across there, and

06:01.508 --> 06:03.211
he said. He had the wrong guy. The guy hadn't even 
passed P.E. Oh, my gosh. And I don't know who that

06:10.081 --> 06:11.503
guy was. But he was going to catch it. But anyway, as 
crippled as Dr. Boughton was, he got up, he shook my

06:13.836 --> 06:21.006
hand, and he walked with me to the door and with his 
big buddies. Everything was fine. He said, you

06:21.847 --> 06:23.890
think you can make a B in that camera? I said, I'm 
pretty sure that I can. And the next close

06:26.734 --> 06:32.481
encounter I had with Dr. Boughton was on the 
interview. Now, I've talked to quite a few people,

06:32.502 --> 06:41.794
and my daughter being one of them, that the 
difference is the way they interview them

06:32.502 --> 06:41.794
nowadays and when they did it in those days. 
Nowadays they have a committee of three that

06:42.500 --> 06:58.104
interview people and they make an appointment 
sometime during the day and they talk with them for

06:42.500 --> 06:58.104
an hour or so and they score them and it's all 
written down as to how many points you get. If

06:59.266 --> 07:02.010
you're going to get the total number of points all 
three of them have to agree that you need a total. If

07:06.361 --> 07:14.230
you're going to get a zero, all three of them have to 
agree that it's a zero, and if it's a split

07:06.361 --> 07:14.230
decision, you get it in the middle, and that's the 
way your interaction goes. But in the days that we

07:14.250 --> 07:29.027
went, they had most of the interviews at night 
after class, but they didn't want you to miss any

07:14.250 --> 07:29.027
class, and it was after dark when I went in there, 
and you went in the dean's office, and they had this

07:14.250 --> 07:29.027
swivel chair in the middle of the room. And the 
department heads were in chairs all the way around

07:30.138 --> 07:32.943
the room. Oh boy, that's the hot box. And they'd ask 
you all kinds of questions, not necessarily

07:34.787 --> 07:43.182
pertaining to your studies, because they had your 
transcript, they knew what your grades were. And

07:44.244 --> 07:49.634
never, while I was in there, was a question asked by 
a person who I was facing. It was always from

07:49.715 --> 07:51.538
behind. And you turn around and face the person and 
you ask them a question and you just about finish

07:52.615 --> 07:58.622
your answer. And the guy behind you asks you one. 
You spin around and you answer him. And you just

08:02.487 --> 08:06.392
about got dizzy and then all of a sudden knocked 
about and says, okay, interview's over. And you

08:07.093 --> 08:09.716
take out and bring somebody else in. And you had no 
idea of what kind of impression you made. Because

08:13.152 --> 08:15.015
you couldn't see the faces of the people. You were 
too scared to even recognize what they were.

08:17.478 --> 08:19.241
Inquisition almost, doesn't it? Inquisition, it 
was. And in those days, being that Dr. Baffin was

08:21.023 --> 08:28.855
the dean, you had to swear to be damned that when you 
graduate, you're going to West Texas and work on

08:21.023 --> 08:28.855
sheep and goats. And that was the thing. That got 
you. That was going to get you in. That got you. But

08:34.342 --> 08:35.424
anyway, I got in. And it was a enjoyable time. When I 
first got in, all of the veterinary college was on

08:38.689 --> 08:43.075
the main campus. And after the second year, they 
moved the hospital over across the tracks. And the

08:48.806 --> 08:54.795
time that I was a senior, they had moved the basic 
science on over there. They had finished the

08:54.815 --> 08:59.461
building there, and they had all of the vet school 
there on the other side of the track scene. It is

09:00.583 --> 09:04.829
only a very small part of the buildings that are 
there right now. Yeah. It is a very small part. But

09:07.933 --> 09:08.974
we thought it was great. We were really in the high 
top cotton. It was really something. Yeah. So you

09:13.345 --> 09:17.872
started, let me get the chronology right, you went 
to A&M. 1950 is when I started as a freshman in

09:17.892 --> 09:29.872
pre-med, and September of 1952 is when I got into 
medical school, and I graduated in May 1956.

09:33.738 --> 09:39.167
We started out with 64 in our class, and we 
graduated 54. As a contrast to the way it is today,

09:40.902 --> 09:47.388
they run about twice as many students now. They run 
somewhere between about 128. And

09:49.790 --> 09:58.497
at that time, we had a faculty total of 19 people. 
They have more than that in the anatomy department

09:58.517 --> 10:03.161
now. And that was counting the dean. Yeah. That was 
different. And they were handling relatively

10:06.845 --> 10:09.627
large loads. Well, half the number of students 
where they are now. Of course, the technology

10:12.845 --> 10:15.147
wasn't near as much. No, that's it. That world has 
really changed. We had three clinicians in the

10:17.409 --> 10:19.672
small animal. We had three clinicians in the large 
animal. We had two people in anatomy. We had one in

10:23.636 --> 10:31.123
parasitology and about three in... You remember 
any special people there you remember? Dr. Turk,

10:31.143 --> 10:33.085
everybody remembers. You know, everybody does. 
Dr. Turk is one of the biggest philosophers that

10:40.403 --> 10:43.387
veterinary medicine has ever had. I mean, he 
always had a good outlook, always, everything was

10:43.407 --> 10:48.393
funny. He enjoyed life. His death, he wore hearing 
aid and therefore he talked kind of funny. He did.

10:57.345 --> 11:03.373
And he was always pulling the gag on somebody, but 
one of the smartest minds that she ever was. He had a

11:06.412 --> 11:12.298
master's in parasitology and he confers PhDs on 
people. He was that good. He was one of the most

11:12.858 --> 11:18.323
highly recognized parasitologists in the 
country. But he had no need or reason to go and get a

11:18.343 --> 11:22.327
PhD. He knew all the stuff. He was training PhDs. 
And a likable man you never saw any more likable. He

11:30.874 --> 11:33.917
and I got into a real good thing and he was one that 
always said that he didn't want anybody bringing

11:36.175 --> 11:46.552
him a paper complaining about a grade unless it's 
going to make a difference in their total grade. I

11:46.572 --> 11:47.754
mean, he didn't want to worry about it. There's 
going to be a few mistakes. Well, he made a big error

11:49.157 --> 11:53.003
on that. Well, he took off one point on it and 
there's a place on the back where he should have

11:53.523 --> 11:59.432
taken off ten more. He had it marked, but he didn't 
subtract. He just batted the subtraction. And so I

12:03.157 --> 12:07.724
went up there and showed him, and man, he jumped on 
me with both feet for bothering him with that

12:03.157 --> 12:07.724
thing. Because I was complaining about a 98. And I 
said, but sir, but sir, man, he's really cussing

12:09.587 --> 12:14.955
me. But I flipped over and said, but what about this 
ten you're supposed to take off? I never had

12:20.320 --> 12:22.142
anybody come back. He says, if anyone says, I'll 
split the difference with you, they'll still give

12:22.583 --> 12:27.590
you an A. And I got an A in the course. I've had that 
happen a couple times, once or twice since I've

12:29.112 --> 12:32.056
been teaching. And that's about what I did. I said, 
OK, I'll give you an A. All of a sudden, I was doing

12:34.620 --> 12:37.584
better in the course, too. I was learning more. I 
got out of it. I got more assistance from him. Oh,

12:43.532 --> 12:44.433
you appreciate that. You remember a guy who does 
that. Well, the year I graduated, I I was waiting to

12:49.379 --> 12:56.548
go in the Army, and when you've got an Army hanging 
over you, nobody wants to hire you. And so I went to

12:57.169 --> 12:58.631
work with the government. They can't do anything 
there. They've got to take you even if you're going

13:00.613 --> 13:02.696
to go to the Army. So I'd been working with the Army, 
and the ABMA convention was in San Antonio. And the

13:09.985 --> 13:14.931
government sent all of us in Texas down there to the 
convention, and I'd seen Turk. And I was going to

13:15.502 --> 13:18.305
lunch with them, and I was going down the street, 
and I heard this holler. I guess somebody

13:18.345 --> 13:20.608
hollered, hey, Zeke! And I looked up, and Turk was 
sitting on the fender of a car about a half a block

13:21.950 --> 13:25.854
away. Come here! Get on down here! So I turned 
around and come back. He says, the fella here wants

13:29.899 --> 13:32.342
you to meet. He says, you work for the government. 
He says, you need to know this guy. He says, Van

13:36.287 --> 13:38.910
Halen, he's the head man, you know, from 
Washington. No kidding. He says, you need to know

13:40.118 --> 13:41.780
this guy. He says, he's your boss. He says, he's 
your boss. He says, you're getting on a good side of

13:45.424 --> 13:47.045
him. Your next boss, he's going to have to answer to 
him. He says, get to know this guy. Get to know this

13:50.950 --> 13:53.332
guy. He's just a regular down-to-earth sort of 
person. And he was interesting to his students.

13:57.256 --> 13:57.557
Oh, Lord. I mean, all of his students liked him. He 
was great. And they say everything was nice and

14:01.661 --> 14:04.885
funny. He was a serious man. He took everything 
serious, but Not so seriously. There wasn't humor

14:09.518 --> 14:10.940
in things. He was very, very humorous. Like the 
story he told on himself that Dr. Batten called him

14:13.543 --> 14:23.253
up and wondered, says, what was it you told this 
Miss so-and-so? Says, who? Miss so-and-so. She

14:25.336 --> 14:30.422
called me and said that the guy with that hearing 
aid over there was a smart aleck. Oh, her. Says,

14:33.225 --> 14:35.047
well, what did you tell her? Says, she came over 
there and she was worried. Says, She wanted me to do

14:38.189 --> 14:41.814
something, said her cat was up in the tree and 
couldn't get down. I said, well, what did you tell

14:41.834 --> 14:43.296
her? She said, I just told her not to worry about it. 
I said, I've never seen no cat skeletons in a tree.

14:52.889 --> 14:55.172
But this is just the way he approached things. When 
you got out of school, when you graduated, you went

14:55.473 --> 15:01.441
to service. Well, first I went to work for the 
government. I tested cows for the government,

15:03.964 --> 15:07.369
and... They could have kept me out of the service. 
All I had to do was sign my name and I would have got a

15:09.213 --> 15:12.936
deferment. And I told them, I said, well, I may want 
to spend my life working for the government, but I

15:12.957 --> 15:22.967
want to do it on my terms. I don't want you to say, 
okay, now, if you want to quit, well, hey, then

15:23.087 --> 15:28.373
you're going to have to go to the army now. I said, 
I'm going to get my army out of the way. And if I come

15:31.156 --> 15:34.660
back, anytime I want to. Another thing that Dr. 
Turk always told us, he says, Always have you a

15:37.589 --> 15:39.491
license. Keep your license paid up. He said, you 
may have a job that doesn't require a license. He

15:44.595 --> 15:46.256
says, but they come give you a hard time. He said, 
you just point at your license and say, hey, man, I

15:46.276 --> 15:49.099
can go work for myself. He says, if you don't have 
one of those, you're out of their funds. And so I

15:53.603 --> 15:54.583
remember that. And I told him, I said, well, I'm 
going to go to service. So I had it made all the time

15:58.407 --> 16:03.071
that I was in the service. I hate to even mention how 
easy that I did have it. I had checked with them and I

16:07.627 --> 16:14.458
had sent in application for commission and they 
sent it back. It was Charlie Wilson who cut them out

16:14.478 --> 16:22.832
and said there might be a few around but there's 
going to wait for those that have been called

16:14.478 --> 16:22.832
rather than just take them in. Says keep the 
application and when you

16:22.852 --> 16:34.090
get your call, send it back and tell us that you've 
gotten your draft notice. It hadn't been all ready

16:34.475 --> 16:35.716
to go. And I went back and talked to the draft board 
to see what it was all about. And they said, OK, when

16:39.000 --> 16:44.926
you send that in, did you send us a letter 
requesting us to hold up your thing? I said, but we

16:44.946 --> 16:51.874
can't hold it up until we get word from them that 
they're processing the commission. I said, fine.

16:53.235 --> 16:57.360
Well, I got my paperwork, and I dropped the 
envelope in the mail right then. I sent the other

16:57.580 --> 17:02.305
envelope that I already had made out to the draft 
board saying, hold up. Well, by return mail, I got

17:02.808 --> 17:14.343
my commission application back and a letter and 
said that I'd have gotten my draft notice and said

17:02.808 --> 17:14.343
that they didn't have any commissions available. 
Sorry. And so I said, well, I've got to go. So I quit

17:17.688 --> 17:24.016
my job with the government and went home and showed 
up to the draft board. And they put me on a bus in

17:24.037 --> 17:28.883
downtown El Paso, carried me out to Fort Bliss. 
heard everybody in the room, and this sergeant ran

17:29.808 --> 17:39.279
up to the front and says, okay, everybody stay 
there in your chair until I call your name, then

17:29.808 --> 17:39.279
come up here, grab this bottle of pee in it, and sit 
it over there and wait in line. He called out all

17:40.340 --> 17:46.928
these names he got through, and he was pulling up 
his thing, and I was sitting down there, and he

17:40.340 --> 17:46.928
looked down and he says, what are you doing sitting 
down there? He told me to sit here, and he called my

17:47.769 --> 17:49.330
name. I hadn't heard it yet. Come up here. I said, 
what's your name? And I told him, and he couldn't

17:53.976 --> 17:55.517
find it. I said, let me see your draft card. So I 
showed it to him, and well, After I'd gotten my

17:59.086 --> 18:06.476
degree, well, the draft board stamped across my 
card, special registration, because it also

17:59.086 --> 18:06.476
registered for the doctor's draft. He read 
letters across the front that said special

18:07.617 --> 18:10.742
registration. He said, sit down, sir. Sit down. 
Just a minute. He took off. He came back with the

18:13.906 --> 18:14.967
major. The major wanted to see my draft card. Sit 
down, sir. Sit down, sir. Boy, I mean, I was really

18:19.714 --> 18:21.096
somebody. He took me to the major's office, and 
they called the draft board. And the draft board

18:24.480 --> 18:28.165
didn't want to talk to him, says, let me talk to Dr. 
Skidmore. got on the phone with the girl's grandpa

18:28.702 --> 18:31.571
and says, hey, we got your letter. He says, we're 
holding up your paper. He says, you don't have to go

18:33.317 --> 18:36.547
if you don't want to. I said, well, you told me. He 
says, ah, don't worry about it. He says, if you

18:39.035 --> 18:40.821
don't want to go, why don't you go? Just tell them 
adios. Yeah, that's a hard moment of decision.

18:44.942 --> 18:46.323
There you are sitting there. Now, I had already 
talked to the base veterinarian there, and he

18:47.104 --> 18:52.191
says, now, they're doing basic training here. He 
says, I'll try to get you, as soon as basic

18:52.211 --> 19:00.241
training's over, get you into the veterinary 
service, and then we'll work on getting you a

18:52.211 --> 19:00.241
commission. Well, I didn't stay there for basic 
training. They sent me off to Fort Hood. And I went

19:04.686 --> 19:07.129
through... basic training there and being an A&M 
graduate and had a good bit of the military, and

19:07.717 --> 19:15.170
they were short-handed. They had very little 
cadre. They had three officers and four sergeants

19:18.074 --> 19:23.143
to take care of a whole company of men and train 
them. So I taught 50% of the class. I was made an

19:25.948 --> 19:27.270
Aggie sergeant. I was the only guy in the company 
that could go to the PX and drink beer anytime I

19:27.911 --> 19:33.639
wanted to. But I had it made. And then for the next 
bit, I went to Stele at Fort Hood. Because I wanted

19:45.196 --> 19:49.862
to stay at Fort Hood because I could go back and 
forth to Palestine and see my wife. I wasn't

19:49.882 --> 19:52.265
married to yet. And then the whole bunch was being 
sent to Germany as replacements in the 3rd Army

19:52.966 --> 19:59.955
Division. So I got married three weeks before I 
shipped out to Germany. And she stayed here and I

20:04.361 --> 20:11.710
shipped out to Germany and we got on the ship and it 
had When we was down in the hole, the peons down

20:12.365 --> 20:16.751
there in the hole, it was awful. Anyway, the word 
got out that I was a veterinarian, so they called me

20:16.771 --> 20:23.600
up, and there was dependents that had pets. And 
says, hey, will you take care of the pet deck? And it

20:26.444 --> 20:32.533
was a deck that was a little bit bigger than these 
two rooms together, and they had a fancy cage. They

20:32.553 --> 20:33.875
said, you don't have to do anything. They've got to 
feed them, and they've got to walk around. But you

20:36.378 --> 20:38.782
keep the deck clean. And nobody's allowed up here 
besides the dependents. And I looked down and,

20:41.486 --> 20:44.351
golly, GI's everywhere. You don't have a place to 
stand, sit, or anything. I had this all to myself. I

20:47.375 --> 20:48.056
said, I'll take it. I'll take it. Well, anyway, one 
of the guys that were there with the pet happened to

20:49.138 --> 20:54.867
be the first sergeant that was going over. And he 
was in charge of the veterinary division at Market

20:54.907 --> 20:58.673
Center. I got to talking to him. He says, well, 
that's a bad deal. He says, as soon as I get there,

21:02.248 --> 21:04.451
I'll talk to Colonel Watson. He says, we'll get you 
changed over to the veterinary services. We got

21:07.757 --> 21:10.121
enlisted people and the like. I mean, I didn't even 
know a lot about the veterinary services. He says,

21:12.344 --> 21:14.127
we'll get you there. First chance you get, you come 
in to Frankfort, and we'll see about getting you

21:14.167 --> 21:20.498
changed. And I told him where I was going to go and 
everything. Well, I no sooner got to where I was

21:22.861 --> 21:25.065
supposed to be And they moved me to another plant. 
And so they couldn't find me. And I was trying my

21:29.572 --> 21:31.756
best to get in Frankfurt. I stationed in Hanau, 
about 50 kilometers out of Frankfurt. You know,

21:36.865 --> 21:40.231
work all day, and the market center closed on the 
weekends, and this, that, and the other. Well, the

21:40.271 --> 21:48.606
first sergeant that comes through the barracks 
one day says, next Thursday is the 4th of July. He

21:49.058 --> 21:50.080
says, it's a holiday. He says, but I'm taking 
volunteers for a parade. He says, we've got to have

21:52.184 --> 21:57.734
a parade on the 4th of July, and anybody that 
volunteers for a parade will have the 5th off. I

21:57.754 --> 21:58.295
said, take me. Take me. That's what you've been 
looking for. Get out. Shoot, I was on the drill team

22:01.901 --> 22:04.065
and everything. In college, I wasn't afraid to go 
for a parade. Most of those guys didn't know how to

22:06.349 --> 22:09.976
march, let alone go for a parade. It's awful. 
Anyway, I went. right and early the next minute I

22:13.747 --> 22:18.051
went on a train to Frankfurt. I went up there and 
told them where I was, what I was doing, and

22:18.572 --> 22:21.154
everything. And they said, well, we'll check on 
you. We'll work you. And all of the time that I

22:25.939 --> 22:31.124
talked to them in the meantime, I told them, you 
know, I'd like to get out. And it's impossible, it

22:31.204 --> 22:37.650
is absolutely impossible to transfer out of the 
Third Army. And I told them that. I said, well, I

22:38.410 --> 22:40.092
said, You just be quiet. He says, we'll take care of 
things. Well, the next Monday, when I got back from

22:43.158 --> 22:53.647
work at noon, the guys in the barracks that work 
personnel says, hey, somebody down in Frankfort

22:43.158 --> 22:53.647
knows you. I said, yeah. He says, the major's been 
on the phone all morning about you. I said, what's

22:59.332 --> 23:01.414
going on? We had dinner, and I was sitting around 
the barracks waiting to go back to work, and the

23:01.434 --> 23:05.778
major comes up. All of a sudden, he's a 
buddy-buddy, and he says, say, who do you know down

23:05.798 --> 23:10.382
in Frankfort? I said, I don't know who's down 
there. And he looked at me and said, well, some of

23:13.371 --> 23:16.874
the, I don't know. And he, and all this went on for a 
couple weeks. He was calling this, that, and the

23:21.319 --> 23:22.720
other. And my spies in there kept telling me, he 
says, you know, they're working on it. And Major's

23:26.664 --> 23:33.351
trying to give so-and-so, I mean, he's a guy with 
about 45 IQ, he's trying to send them over there,

23:26.664 --> 23:33.351
and this, that, and the other. And so I did get back 
into Frankfort to see him once again, and they

23:34.172 --> 23:37.956
said, well, we, About got this deal worked. Says, 
you play ignorant. Says, but next week, says,

23:44.166 --> 23:49.413
you're going to get orders to be transferred to us. 
And your orders are going to say that you're

23:50.234 --> 23:54.199
supposed to go to Holland. Says, but that's not a 
good post. We're going to change you to

23:56.922 --> 23:58.484
Copenhagen. Says, you, when you get them, you tell 
them to just send you to Market Center and we'll

24:00.515 --> 24:03.739
take care of everything." He says, "'Cause you 
can't go to Holland anyway or Copenhagen, either

24:03.759 --> 24:10.347
one, because all you got is a uniform and you can't 
go in there with a uniform. You gotta go in civilian

24:11.208 --> 24:13.511
clothes." So the Major and the First Sergeant, 
they kept asking me a few questions. I didn't know

24:16.714 --> 24:17.415
anything. Colonel Watson had told me, he said, you 
know, the less you know, the better off anyway. And

24:23.262 --> 24:23.923
so they had I was a very sorry radio operator, so 
they sent me to typing school because it's good to

24:24.376 --> 24:32.467
give you teletypewriters and teach me to type so I 
can run a teletypewriter. And one afternoon, the

24:33.909 --> 24:39.095
first sergeant called over and says, turn in your 
typewriter. He says, you're going to Holland. He

24:40.377 --> 24:45.103
says, get your foot over here to the, he says, I've 
got two days to get you out of here. So I went over

24:46.125 --> 24:50.991
there and I said, now, sergeant, I said, all you got 
to do is clear me post, get through the Captain's

24:51.292 --> 24:55.536
driver took me and dumped me down at the Market 
Center in Frankfort. He said, I can't do that. Your

24:56.517 --> 24:57.558
orders ain't safe. I said, look, how come just two 
hours ago you're saying that now you know what's

24:57.918 --> 25:06.246
the matter? But anyway, I convinced him to call, 
and I had the number, and I told him to call Colonel

25:06.266 --> 25:11.431
Watson and get the scoop on it. The colonel says, 
just send him down here, and we'll take care of him.

25:13.953 --> 25:15.275
He says, I'll be your back. Anyway, I got down 
there, and they I stayed a couple of days while they

25:18.106 --> 25:26.518
processed me and changed my orders and issued me 
civilian clothes and sent me to Copenhagen where I

25:18.106 --> 25:26.518
was assigned to the embassy. Well, that's nice. 
That's where our office was. But we was inspecting

25:30.564 --> 25:38.335
meat and foods, all dairy products and everything 
that was produced in Denmark. It was going to the

25:38.355 --> 25:39.677
troops in Germany. But Denmark did not allow 
uniformed foreign troops on their soil. So we all

25:45.826 --> 25:47.488
wore civilian clothes. And it was a nice place. 
It's a clean place. At the time, I smoked. And I

25:56.769 --> 26:02.054
wouldn't dare drop a cigarette butt on the street, 
because I'd be the only one in town. I'd go back to

26:03.255 --> 26:06.638
the embassy, and both of my suit pockets would be 
full of cigarette butts. And I'd empty them out in a

26:06.658 --> 26:08.260
wastebasket. It's a clean town. If you dropped 
your gum on the street, you wouldn't be afraid to

26:09.481 --> 26:13.104
pick it up and put it back in your mouth. It is very 
nice. The people are nice, friendly, and all.

26:17.219 --> 26:22.003
Anyway, while I was there, I got a letter from my 
brother. He sent me a card that said the 4th Army,

26:22.023 --> 26:30.851
which is in Texas, had an opening for a 
veterinarian they wanted me to send in my

26:22.023 --> 26:30.851
application. So I told the colonel, I said, hey, 
they got one here for that thing that's for 4th

26:30.911 --> 26:40.319
Army. Just a minute, he got on the phone and they got 
him to change that allocation for 7th Army, which

26:40.720 --> 26:46.905
is here. And so I had to go take a physical and all 
that kind of stuff. And they sent me down to

26:52.122 --> 26:56.791
Frankfort to get a physical. I had no sooner flown 
back, and the colonel says, you got to go back to

26:58.033 --> 27:02.262
Frankfort. that they didn't get a full picture of 
your chest on x-rays. I said, I'm six foot two, and

27:06.613 --> 27:09.057
I've got 30 inch legs. I'm all chest. And they 
missed it. They missed it. They just missed it.

27:11.620 --> 27:12.842
They missed part of it. So I had to fly back to 
Frankfurt. They took another picture of my chest,

27:14.524 --> 27:23.597
and they processed the, I think it took them about 
four weeks to process the commission for me. And in

27:23.738 --> 27:26.301
the States, it takes about 12 or so weeks. Yeah, you 
were living sort of a charmed life. I was. That's

27:29.326 --> 27:29.947
what I say. I mean, I had it. Why didn't I stay in the 
Army? Yeah. I wanted to be a veterinary

27:32.549 --> 27:34.492
practitioner. I didn't want to be there to begin 
with. But it was all the way through, it was a nice

27:36.935 --> 27:40.640
thing for me. In fact, I signed the papers. My 
executive officer signed the papers.

27:50.975 --> 27:52.236
The commander signed the papers. The special 
courier took them to Frankfurt. They signed the

27:54.840 --> 28:02.050
papers and they went by special courier to 
Heidelberg, which is the USAR headquarters in the

28:02.384 --> 28:13.215
the chief user of veterinarian signed them there 
and they hand carried them and woke up a two-star

28:02.384 --> 28:13.215
general in the middle of the night to get the 
authorization for it. And he had already said, now

28:13.275 --> 28:17.519
whatever time they come in, get me up and I'll sign 
them. And at two o'clock in the morning they woke

28:17.539 --> 28:23.125
him up and he signed the papers and got a teletype to 
Washington to get the thing. I mean, it's all

28:23.145 --> 28:25.086
working for them. Yeah, it really is. The bad part 
of it was then they thought maybe I'd want to stay in

28:27.509 --> 28:31.733
the service. And there I was in a place that didn't 
even wear uniforms anymore. So they transferred

28:36.989 --> 28:42.499
me to Munich, which is a very nice place, if you've 
never been to Copenhagen. If you've never been to

28:43.421 --> 28:47.148
Copenhagen, it's a real nice place, but it's a step 
down. Tough life you're living. Tough life. But

28:50.575 --> 28:55.324
they had an officer there that was a regular Army 
officer in a very and they wanted to be sure that I

28:55.658 --> 29:02.408
knew how to operate as a military officer if I ever 
did want to stay. And what really chapped me is as a

29:03.009 --> 29:24.062
PFC in Denmark, being that there's no military and 
no PX and this and that, with all of the different

29:03.009 --> 29:24.062
pay and all that I got, I jumped from PFC to a first 
lieutenant and moved to Munich and as a first

29:03.009 --> 29:24.062
lieutenant In the veterinary corps, I got an extra 
$100 a month professional pay, and it cost me about

29:24.397 --> 29:31.443
$100 a month to do that. I mean, I was making more as a 
PSC than I was as a... But anyway, I had to sign up for

29:35.787 --> 29:41.472
two years from that time, and my wife had already 
come over. I made her way over, and we lived there in

29:41.512 --> 29:52.142
Munich for two years, and our oldest child was born 
there about five weeks before we came back. Just

29:53.888 --> 29:55.890
old, just was old enough to travel. And I went ahead 
and got out and went to work in a private practice in

29:57.632 --> 30:04.860
Gainesville. In Gainesville? Gainesville, 
Texas, up on the Red River. How'd you get there? I

30:11.927 --> 30:21.758
had put an ad in the ABMA Journal that I was, would be 
available in January of 1950. 1960.

30:25.367 --> 30:33.780
And I got this letter that this was available, and 
it was on my way, because I drove from New York down,

30:25.367 --> 30:33.780
and so I just stopped by there and checked with 
them. On the way to Palestine, where my wife and

30:33.800 --> 30:38.347
daughter were, they flew back. Incidentally, 
they had... Go ahead. Was this a practice that you

30:42.123 --> 30:43.985
were buying? No, no, I was just going to work for 
him. You were open up. I was just going to go work for

30:46.188 --> 30:48.211
this guy. Oh, okay. He had a practice doctor, 
Gordon Yergin. Okay. And he said, yeah, come to

30:52.056 --> 30:56.101
work as soon as you can. So I went and spent 
Christmas with my in-laws and went back up there

30:56.201 --> 31:03.270
and found a place to live. And it was just for a 
two-year period because his associate had gone to

31:03.290 --> 31:08.217
the service. And so I was there for two years. And I 
feel that any... veterinarian, you're not

31:13.055 --> 31:17.459
required to intern as a veterinarian. But all 
veterinarians, when they graduate, should work

31:18.160 --> 31:24.406
with another practitioner. Because there's a lot 
of things that you can learn they do not, cannot,

31:24.426 --> 31:31.373
should not teach you in school. Well, that's the 
way with Alec Sears. Apparently, he opened up his

31:36.098 --> 31:41.003
office flat, cold,

31:41.607 --> 31:43.130
He's Texas, wherever it was. Anyway, he had, and I 
kind of followed this because not many people do

31:43.590 --> 31:53.366
that, and that's ill-advised, but he had a really 
strong background in economics. And I have a sense

31:53.386 --> 31:56.532
that that was a big plus for him. Apparently he set 
up a practice, and it was a marketable thing. He

31:59.937 --> 32:02.862
sold it in two years and then moved over here. Yeah. 
See, it's very difficult to practice economics.

32:07.477 --> 32:08.298
like you should. And be a businessman too. And well 
not only that, but see they teach you the exact

32:10.700 --> 32:19.550
procedure like it should be done in school, which 
they should. But then there are a lot of shortcuts

32:20.210 --> 32:25.075
that you need to do if you're going to make a living 
at it. And you need to learn. And one of the big

32:25.896 --> 32:32.643
examples is the first day I went into this 
practice, I had to remove a cancer eye from a cow.

32:33.204 --> 32:36.387
And I did just like the book and how they taught me in 
school. And it took me about four hours to do it, and

32:36.805 --> 32:40.389
it was a sorry job. The day I left, I had to take a 
cat's ride out of Macau. From the time the guy drove

32:45.515 --> 32:51.843
up to the time he drove off was 20 minutes, and it was 
a darn good job. I mean, it's experience and a few

32:51.903 --> 33:03.977
things that you learn to do, and it may not be the 
exact procedure, but it is better. Because when

33:04.278 --> 33:06.461
you're in school, you don't care about time. 
You're learning. It's a learning process. The

33:09.385 --> 33:11.668
more sutures you make, the better you get at 
suturing. When you're making a liver, the fewer

33:11.688 --> 33:16.655
sutures you make, the quicker you get done. And 
it's that simple. It changes your whole...

33:19.960 --> 33:21.942
Anyway, I went to... That's a good point. There for 
two years, and then I tried to put in a practice in my

33:22.042 --> 33:32.597
old hometown in El Paso, and I could not get any 
zoning like I needed. Okay, I picked up on that a lot

33:33.050 --> 33:34.632
too. I went to the zoning board and where I really 
had trouble with the zoning board, I think there

33:34.652 --> 33:46.829
were seven people on the zoning board. And to get a 
variance, you had to have six of them for you. There

33:55.281 --> 34:02.331
was one guy on the zoning board that he vowed, and it 
was made public, that he would not ever vote for a

34:03.070 --> 34:04.793
variance. Because if there should be a variance, 
it should change the law. And the variances were

34:10.022 --> 34:11.285
not. He would not vote for a variance. So it would 
take a unanimous of the others to get it. One of the

34:17.676 --> 34:22.184
others was a wife of a veterinarian in town. So she 
would abstain because of it. So there's no way I can

34:25.289 --> 34:28.555
get six votes. And so I worked as a day laborer at a 
new post office there. I worked as a day laborer. Is

34:35.604 --> 34:36.305
that right? Yeah, just to keep going while I was 
trying to get this zoning. And it was at Christmas

34:39.768 --> 34:43.852
time so I worked nights at the post office sorting 
mail. And I soon quit that night job because I had to

34:45.053 --> 34:58.525
get home one time while my daughter was awake and 
she was hiding behind her mother like she didn't

34:45.053 --> 34:58.525
even recognize me. I said, this isn't going to get 
it. So in the meantime, I needed somebody back in

35:02.017 --> 35:11.310
his practice, an additional body. So I went back 
there with him for about six months. And a

35:14.033 --> 35:21.363
classmate of mine was going to go to Guam and was 
wanting to lease out his practice in Mesquite. So I

35:21.383 --> 35:23.226
leased his practice and went there. And this is one 
of the big reasons that I went there. When you go to

35:27.378 --> 35:37.755
work for somebody, you always have this wonder if 
people are using you just because they can't get to

35:27.378 --> 35:37.755
the guy you're working for. I mean, you're just a 
second choice. And you wonder if you can do it on

35:41.321 --> 35:43.725
your own. So you want to have this idea. I am going to 
be the man. And anything that I get is because they

35:49.211 --> 35:54.297
came to see me, not because they couldn't get the 
other guy. So you've got to have this. It's there.

35:57.501 --> 36:02.768
And it's what I tell so many guys that hire people to 
work for them. And they say, golly, I hired him. I

36:04.050 --> 36:04.951
said, boy, he's real good. And I thought he'd stay 
with me. But he left. I said, he had never been on his

36:07.715 --> 36:10.679
own. I said, if you want somebody to stay, hire 
somebody that's already been on his own once. Then

36:15.286 --> 36:16.488
he'll stay. Gee, never thought of that. But 
anyway, it's a built-in thing. So I went there and

36:20.517 --> 36:28.112
found out that I could do it myself and felt good 
about it. Then he came back and we were going to be

36:28.172 --> 36:33.042
partners and we didn't get along too good.

36:35.030 --> 36:37.132
Everybody has differences in any way. Dan 
Anderson then was needing somebody, so I came over

36:37.272 --> 36:41.176
here to work. I went to work with Dan Anderson. I 
worked with him for about 11 years, and I decided to

36:43.298 --> 36:53.948
go on my own tour in Euless, and moved to Euless, and 
I've been there ever since. Now, when you first

36:54.749 --> 37:03.157
came to, well, Gainesville, let's say, with Dan 
Anderson, are you in large animal? Are you horses?

37:04.105 --> 37:09.392
Horses, cattle, general practices are those 
things. You don't turn anything. Anything, okay.

37:13.316 --> 37:15.199
I said chickens and snakes. That's about the only 
thing I turned down is chickens and snakes. In hope

37:19.124 --> 37:21.847
that nobody brought me hogs, but I did work them. 
But did you get in the same way? I guess you did. At

37:24.423 --> 37:31.210
what point did you notice that your practice was 
distinctly changing, when you were with Dan

37:24.423 --> 37:31.210
Anderson or when you were on your own at Euless? 
When I was on my own at Euless, when I was with Dan,

37:31.230 --> 37:38.778
that's when we were doing the work for Bone and 
Hunt, both of us. I was doing most of it out there.

37:41.220 --> 37:52.472
And I told you about how they kind of gave me a 
glancing eye, but once it was established I mean, I

37:53.566 --> 37:59.935
don't want to sound like I'm a blowhard, but I was a 
good veterinarian, and that's what it is. Good

37:59.975 --> 38:00.976
psychology, that's right. I just wanted to sell my 
veterinary skills, not my ability to round up

38:01.437 --> 38:08.486
cattle and all that kind of stuff. And that's

38:08.506 --> 38:19.361
when I was working for Dan Anderson, and we did a 
good bit of charlay people in the work out around.

38:19.462 --> 38:22.746
Once you go to working for some of them that are in a 
group, And particularly if you're capable of

38:23.570 --> 38:43.915
handling their sails for them, get their animals 
ready for sale, get them tested and their ghouls

38:23.570 --> 38:43.915
fertility tested and all that, and being able to 
handle them, all of a sudden they flock in on you and

38:23.570 --> 38:43.915
we'd have a sale going on most all the time, and it 
was nice. And these people paid money. They never

38:45.917 --> 38:50.843
did ask about, oh, gee, you're charging us too 
much, or this, that, and the other. We sent them a

38:51.076 --> 38:54.339
bill, and if I returned mail, you'd get it back. 
Well, I didn't say return mail. Here's another

38:55.661 --> 38:58.444
thing that I've learned. A lot of these big people, 
and you don't need to mention this until you've

38:58.464 --> 39:10.516
done your hunts, number one, these big 
corporations, they'll float no matter who it is.

39:10.576 --> 39:15.882
If there's not a thing, they'll put off paying you 
for years and years and years if they can. It's a way

39:17.564 --> 39:19.165
of doing business. Well, when I was in 
Gainesville, I happened to learn from a fellow

39:20.708 --> 39:24.753
station that took care of my car. He's a mechanic 
and he's having trouble getting money out of these

39:25.474 --> 39:30.941
old field trucks he's working on. Slumber J and you 
know, these big things. He's working, he sent him a

39:33.303 --> 39:37.068
bill and you know, he'd eventually get it and he 
wasn't getting it. And one of the drivers then told

39:37.088 --> 39:44.517
him, he says, what you've got to do, and I remember 
this and this is what we did the whole time. He says,

39:44.537 --> 39:48.522
what you've got to do when you do work for them, he 
says, charge them about 25% more than you do other

39:49.227 --> 39:59.660
people, send them their bill, and tell them if they 
pay you within 10 days to take a 10% discount. And

39:59.680 --> 40:00.981
you're still ahead. And you're still ahead. And in 
10 days, you get your money just like that. That's

40:05.146 --> 40:07.349
good technology. So some of our big ones that were a 
little bit slow, we'd do that. We'd charge them a

40:10.853 --> 40:13.817
little bit more and put on their bill. We'd pay in 10 
days, deduct so much, and we'd give them a pretty

40:14.097 --> 40:18.222
good discount. Just like that, you get a return. 
And that's true for any kind of business. Because I

40:23.886 --> 40:27.990
gather that's another problem in veterinary 
medicine. It's collecting. In a small animal, in

40:29.411 --> 40:35.196
my business now, I have no accounts receivable. My 
charges are MasterCard and Visa. And I just tell

40:39.019 --> 40:44.364
them that my banker told me that if I didn't loan 
money, he wouldn't treat animals. And we've got a

40:44.824 --> 40:46.806
deal going. That's good, yeah. And this is the way 
it works. It's old. It gets stung every now and

40:53.460 --> 40:54.661
then. A lot of times they don't have their money 
with them. There's a lot of things that never wait

40:57.805 --> 41:00.368
to decay. And we do it. Now, it gets stung every now 
and then, but unfortunately not too often. Any of

41:05.295 --> 41:08.859
it, it hurts.

41:10.081 --> 41:12.284
So now, but when did you begin to know? Let's talk 
about the large animal, small animal conversion.

41:17.450 --> 41:18.111
I noticed. Because when I moved to Euless, I had a 
large animal hospital. I bought it from a person

41:22.050 --> 41:25.754
who was only using it for small animals at the time. 
But it had large animal facilities there. We had a

41:28.517 --> 41:29.938
nice small animal clinic. We had a large animal 
surgery, large animal treatment room, a barn with

41:30.759 --> 41:35.824
four stalls. We had all of the facilities for large 
and small animals. And what year is this? Do you

41:41.050 --> 41:42.692
remember? 1978.

41:48.533 --> 41:52.799
So I did make a practice and I had a band and I made 
calls and this and that. And like I say, north of me

41:52.839 --> 41:57.626
there was wide open country, lots of horses and 
all. And then they started building. And then in

42:00.049 --> 42:08.140
1984, it was just about crowding me out. I mean, I'd 
have to travel too far to do horses, except race

42:08.160 --> 42:12.727
horses. And I could not find a race horse trainer 
that would use me. Because I would only treat them

42:17.812 --> 42:27.285
with what medications I thought they ought to 
have, not the medications that they wanted me to

42:17.812 --> 42:27.285
give them. And that just didn't work out. So most of 
my horse work was individual owners. And they'd

42:35.136 --> 42:36.758
just been moved out. So I didn't have that much 
work. And way out for cattle, and that's by myself

42:38.060 --> 42:41.625
if I spent several hours gone just going and coming 
while I had to charge them so much that they

42:42.382 --> 42:51.535
couldn't afford me and be gone from a small animal 
practice that I couldn't do anything. And then the

42:51.595 --> 43:03.732
local bank came and said, we're doing real good and 
we're going to put in another bank and this

42:51.595 --> 43:03.732
location is a place that we'd like to have in the 
area around here. So I got to looking and to fix that

43:03.752 --> 43:11.443
place up like I wanted would cost me a bundle. And so 
they cut me a deal that I could get out from under

43:12.352 --> 43:17.800
what I owed some. I sold them the place and I put in 
there a small animal practice in a shopping

43:18.441 --> 43:23.929
center. And I moved from about a 6,000 square foot 
hospital to a 1,200 square foot hospital. Do you

43:30.860 --> 43:32.041
have a partner's now? Well, I moved into that place 
in 84. And my daughter graduated from vet school in

43:38.390 --> 43:45.339
85 and was taking her to come there. So she 
graduated, I put her name on the window. She came in

43:48.664 --> 44:02.102
and she worked with me until October, because in 
the meantime there's a practice that became

43:48.664 --> 44:02.102
available and we was able to, well it was before she 
graduated and I was trying to negotiate. Even

44:02.639 --> 44:10.287
then, you know, funds are hard to get by, this, 
that, and the other, and it took until October that

44:02.639 --> 44:10.287
we were able to swing the deal and we got it for her 
over there. So she's out there, but we function for

44:10.307 --> 44:14.271
each other. I mean, if I've got to be gone a half day 
or anything, well, we'll schedule it. She'll come

44:17.374 --> 44:20.778
to my place and do it, and I'll go to hers and help 
her. Or maybe she's got something she needs some

44:21.599 --> 44:27.685
help on, well, I'll go there during the day or at 
noontime or whatever. And being that she's a lot

44:28.559 --> 44:42.377
younger and had a much more technical education 
than I have, there's a lot of things I'll call her,

44:28.559 --> 44:42.377
hey, how about this, that, and the other, and 
she'll call me and say, hey, Dad, didn't they used

44:28.559 --> 44:42.377
to use such and such? We complement each other. And 
it works real nice, and I enjoy it. She's

44:50.749 --> 44:54.013
independent, you're independent. That's right, 
yeah. I'm surprised you didn't think about

44:55.694 --> 44:59.439
partnerships and all this. Well, that was 
originally. But on the other hand, there wasn't

45:01.643 --> 45:06.890
enough business to all of a sudden do it. And it 
would have taken a while. Well, here's one that's

45:08.613 --> 45:13.200
far enough apart that we're not wrong with each 
other. And yet, we have several common clients. It

45:19.028 --> 45:20.851
happens to be which way they want to go. And then 
they come back and forth. It works out real well.

45:27.706 --> 45:33.714
Let me ask you a little bit about TVMA and your 
association. When did you become tuned in, you

45:33.734 --> 45:37.819
might say, to TVMA? I would say that probably Dan 
Anderson did more to help me decide to do, to get

45:38.039 --> 45:52.498
involved with organized veterinary medicine 
than anybody because he is a past president of the

45:38.039 --> 45:52.498
AVMA. and he was quite active in that. He's never 
been real active in TPMA. He's very active in

45:56.225 --> 46:11.509
Organized Veterinary Medicine and I was working 
with him and I just kind of tuned in to that and of

45:56.225 --> 46:11.509
course, in the meantime too, Charles Huth was the 
Executive Secretary. And so I do a little going on

46:11.790 --> 46:18.621
and then there's always something that was being 
passed or new things going on that I didn't

46:18.922 --> 46:22.611
necessarily agree with. And I said, hey, why 
didn't they ask me? They said, well, I need to get

46:25.317 --> 46:28.244
involved. I can't just sit back and bitch. I need to 
be in there when they're discussing it. Now, if I

46:34.078 --> 46:37.285
could get my say in, If I get outvoted, fine, I'll go 
along with it. But I want to be sure that they know my

46:40.829 --> 46:46.425
side, rather than read about it in the journal and 
say, hey, I wonder, did they know this? Or did they

46:46.625 --> 46:48.270
ever think of this? And you know how it goes. 
Anytime you make a decision, you always get

46:49.112 --> 46:53.063
somebody to say, hey, did you think of that?
