WEBVTT

00:06.241 --> 00:07.182
Okay, it's going now. That was terrific. To start 
at the lowest level was just about the most fun you

00:11.028 --> 00:18.419
could have.

00:18.439 --> 00:20.321
Maybe some girl will like you at the end of the 
night. Of course, there's always some guy that

00:21.503 --> 00:31.558
takes a fancy to her, so he wants to beat you up, so 
you get to practice fighting at the same time. That

00:31.578 --> 00:32.699
was interesting. That was always the way it was. I 
don't care Somebody comes and says, let's leave at

00:36.076 --> 00:39.401
once. I say, yeah, yeah, let's go. And then all of a 
sudden, some clowns come skulking up. Hey, man, I

00:45.450 --> 00:46.412
like her. I say, well, that's the brakes, bubba. 
No, it ain't neither. So you practice all that

00:53.222 --> 00:54.945
stuff. But if you're a delinquent to begin with, 
you don't care. I didn't care. You win, you lose.

01:05.287 --> 01:07.830
So that was the only reason I'm talking about that. 
That's why I decided I didn't really feel sorry for

01:08.751 --> 01:14.779
struggling musicians that I've encountered on 
tour. So you look at the Rock and Roll Pyramid, all

01:14.799 --> 01:19.324
the money is up at the top. Thousands and millions 
of people are languishing, making no money

01:20.606 --> 01:28.536
whatsoever, or $5 a night. As long as they don't 
fancy that they're embarked on some kind of big

01:28.676 --> 01:33.522
career trip, that's fine. If you can enjoy the 
level you're at, it's a very great thing.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.373
What could be more fun than being in the band? I 
think it's great.

01:48.258 --> 01:50.560
Am I jealous that Barry Manilow makes all this 
money? No, but I think it's ridiculous.

01:58.848 --> 01:58.949
Okay. Where do you think the velvet's fed into, 
though? musical scene in the 60s? Or do you think

02:06.034 --> 02:07.716
they were just more or less remembered? Well, we 
didn't really.

02:16.286 --> 02:20.090
We seemed to fit a whole lot better into the late 70s 
and 80s.

02:22.753 --> 02:25.256
We were sort of minimalist and direct. All we did is 
we were kind of heavy metal sometimes and

02:31.214 --> 02:32.555
Lyrically, we're kind of weird. We never did fit 
into the mainstream, obviously. We sold

02:35.418 --> 02:36.900
trillions of records.

02:40.783 --> 02:42.005
But you could hear where we came from. You could 
hear this R&B in there. You really can in the early

02:46.249 --> 02:48.110
stuff. I don't deceive myself. Somebody just gave 
me a tape of a group in the Netherlands doing Run,

02:51.314 --> 02:58.381
Run, Run and Sunday Morning. In Run, Run, Run, they 
They correctly isolate the essential R&B riff in

03:00.661 --> 03:09.395
it, and then in fact emphasize it on the chorus. 
Run, run, run, take a drag or two, that thing.

03:15.284 --> 03:23.757
They use a walking bass line, which it would really 
have if it were done by Bobby Blue Bland or

03:15.284 --> 03:23.757
somebody. They really picked up on it as an R&B 
inspired thing, and just emphasized it. So

03:33.761 --> 03:35.083
there's always this sort of thing.

03:38.669 --> 03:41.974
European Sun, we had, frequently we had different 
titles for the songs. European Sun, we used to

03:42.695 --> 03:50.968
talk, we used to refer to as John Lee Hooker, 
because it has an old John Lee Hooker riff buried

03:42.695 --> 03:50.968
under there someplace. John Lee Hooker was great. 
He's a sad case, back to I was thinking about the

03:57.158 --> 04:01.004
perils of folk singing and selling out. A lot of 
these black R&B guys put down their steel strings

04:01.044 --> 04:12.742
and got these old gut string guitars and started 
playing for little white kids. This was horrible.

04:15.627 --> 04:22.778
John Lee Hooker being one of them started popping 
up in coffee houses as sort of a black folk singer.

04:24.817 --> 04:25.398
I'd be out there. I heard him once do that. I said, 
no, no, no. He had all these old John Lee Hooker

04:28.001 --> 04:31.186
records where he had bands. Boy, they were great, 
great

04:31.206 --> 04:36.553
things. But who could blame him? He was signed on 
for life. I wasn't. I was just some white kid. While

04:44.004 --> 04:45.266
I liked to play, I liked to play. I still like to 
play. It's just very... I don't want to go into it on

04:48.911 --> 04:51.514
this thing. Why does that count? I did have a little 
experiment here in Austin, 77 to 79, and ended

04:54.331 --> 05:01.763
unhappily. All I wanted to do was be a roadhouse 
band, fabulously successful. I'm not kidding. We

05:08.274 --> 05:14.003
set house records and we invented the Continental 
Club and all that sort of thing. We're fondly

05:14.805 --> 05:17.309
remembered. And it collapsed because of 
ambition. All these people secretly they're

05:20.420 --> 05:48.520
friends of mine before we saw the play together 
secretly thought that um if i did it for a while

05:20.420 --> 05:48.520
immediately i'd want to start writing again and 
calling people in new york and going on tour and

05:20.420 --> 05:48.520
making records and like i said then they got 
furious so it's okay for you because you already

05:20.420 --> 05:48.520
did it i said well yeah you're right so maybe you 
want to find somebody else who really wants to do it

05:20.420 --> 05:48.520
and go do it so that brought all that down it was 
unfortunate

05:52.516 --> 05:57.742
I was here once this summer, and I saw a flyer for a 
band, Femme Fatale. Oh, Femme Fatale. Yeah. I

06:01.266 --> 06:01.666
don't know. It's a stock phrase. I wonder if they 
play this song. But you see an influence that the

06:08.213 --> 06:13.239
Velvets had on some later stuff. The punk 
movement, heavy metal, and some of the new wave,

06:13.259 --> 06:22.489
like I believe Rick Ocasek of the Cars has 
mentioned the Velvets as a primary influence.

06:22.790 --> 06:23.891
Yeah. Well, his drummer came by way of the Modern 
Lovers. Jonathan Richmond was like our protege

06:27.795 --> 06:31.078
from the time he was 14 years old. Hung around with 
us and all that sort of thing. Yeah, that's all kind

06:34.701 --> 06:35.602
of nice.

06:40.006 --> 06:41.167
See, the material is always there. It hasn't been 
overplayed on the radio. In fact, it hasn't been

06:43.890 --> 06:44.971
played there at all. It was banned from the radio, 
and even advertising for it was banned. So it's

06:49.975 --> 06:53.398
very easy to make those kind of exciting personal 
discoveries. You want to hear something that

06:54.539 --> 07:02.045
really hasn't been played to death, it's our old 
stuff. We did sell enough records, though, we

07:02.065 --> 07:04.828
really did. Compared to the cars, we haven't. But 
we did okay. Still doing okay royalty-wise.

07:15.617 --> 07:16.878
So I don't feel bad about that. But I wasn't in it for 
a business I don't know. If you're interested in

07:21.650 --> 07:23.832
business, go work for your uncle in the hardware 
store. Same

07:26.055 --> 07:29.558
kind of thing. But it is flattering to be an 
influence. Flattering, but not profitable. But

07:34.324 --> 07:37.607
what endures and what doesn't? Money doesn't. I 
would rather be well thought of than be some

07:40.090 --> 07:46.477
schmuck with a whole lot of money that everybody 
despises.

07:49.740 --> 07:50.661
A category which includes many of my 
contemporaries.

08:01.558 --> 08:12.513
Did you see the Volvets as any influence on society 
at the time, or just an extension of the

08:01.558 --> 08:12.513
avant-garde and beatnik society in New York at the 
time? We're not an influence because it was a

08:12.533 --> 08:20.363
closed society from the beginning.

08:20.383 --> 08:21.745
You couldn't join because you couldn't get in. in a 
kind of, it was not anything that was marketable or

08:22.383 --> 08:27.411
exploitable. We had kind of fashion connections, 
you know, through paraphernalia and Betsy

08:29.474 --> 08:35.303
Johnson. But Betsy talks in the biography about 
how the impression was that everybody is on our

08:35.323 --> 08:49.065
wavelength and doing all these crazy things, 
where in fact very few people were, numerically.

08:51.307 --> 08:53.769
What is the high glamour crowd doing right this 
minute? Well, I'm not sure.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.038
I was just in New York. It's not a whole lot of... 
Billy Idol looks like all the rest of the people who

09:03.539 --> 09:14.149
are trying to look like Billy Idol. So there's 
nothing particularly distinctive about the way

09:14.169 --> 09:16.251
we dressed. We were slobby. By turns. We had real 
good clothes at other times. Betsy made clothes

09:23.374 --> 09:24.375
for us. We certainly bought enough of them. We 
never wore them. I had great stuff. I used to lose

09:30.120 --> 09:35.185
most of

09:30.120 --> 09:35.185
it. I remember just wearing T-shirts and jeans.

09:43.052 --> 09:45.554
We didn't try to influence anything. There were 
clothing stores called the Velvet Underground.

09:47.956 --> 09:50.558
There was a chain. It may still be But that wasn't 
based on anything that we wore in particular. The

09:55.900 --> 10:00.266
girls in, I don't think we were responsible for S&M 
styles, perhaps. Jim Morrison got the idea for

10:00.286 --> 10:02.909
leather pants from Gerard Malanga. We were the 
first to do any of that kind of stuff.

10:09.537 --> 10:13.602
But weirdo dressing was, that's rock and roll to 
the roots. Screamin' Jay Hawkins in his leopard

10:14.043 --> 10:16.045
suits. Big Bopper, the first time I saw him was 
wearing a leopard skin suit. I said, what the hell

10:22.043 --> 10:22.884
is that? They said, it's a big bopper. I said, oh. 
That makes it OK. Oh, yeah.

10:36.185 --> 10:38.289
We never set out to be a fashion influence. We 
didn't try and dream up our own equivalent of

10:39.931 --> 10:43.056
beetle suits.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.658
Okay, this should wind it up. What do you think, why 
has the band, why have you broke up and gone your

10:56.878 --> 11:05.770
separate ways? You said you got tired of living 
that hostile analysis. Well, I would have gotten

11:10.036 --> 11:16.926
tired of it eventually.

11:16.966 --> 11:19.690
Just squabbles, I would say, kind of wore us down. 
Just speculating on that in the biography. It's

11:23.637 --> 11:24.718
hard to say.

11:29.563 --> 11:33.067
See, Lou more or less, well, Lou forced John out, 
which I didn't like. So I stewed on that for a good

11:34.668 --> 11:37.751
while. And I was pretty, I stuck it to Lou whenever I 
got a chance on account of that. And then Lou

11:45.840 --> 11:49.223
eventually left under pressures and shifting 
times, a shifting decade. Lou was a little put out,

11:53.141 --> 11:58.189
I would say, in 1970.

12:01.714 --> 12:07.402
So I stayed playing after Lou left, but I was always 
looking around to see where I'd go in graduate

12:01.714 --> 12:07.402
school. So I just sent out a few applications.

12:11.628 --> 12:14.512
I had all the numbers and stuff, so I knew I'd get in. 
I figured I'd get some support. I was right.

12:21.991 --> 12:27.318
But after Lou left, he tried to talk me into doing a 
thing with him.

12:30.442 --> 12:31.523
Just me and you. We'll go to Europe and put together 
a whole new thing. We'll be far away from these

12:35.568 --> 12:45.240
poisonous idiots who are bothering us all the

12:35.568 --> 12:45.240
time. It's very nice to have a scene that,

12:45.261 --> 12:51.188
we'll say, reveres you. loves you or something 
like that. Well, you are surrounded by people

12:58.443 --> 13:02.449
you've known a long time and very close to, 
socially. It has this negative

13:03.591 --> 13:21.698
corollary that they feel close enough to you in 
everything you do to

13:03.591 --> 13:21.698
complain long and bitterly about everything that 
you do. They don't think you ought to be doing it. We

13:24.705 --> 13:29.111
hear all these harangues about what we ought to be 
doing. Why weren't we? You know, people looking

13:33.957 --> 13:35.839
out for your own best interests. You hear enough of 
this stuff. After a while, you figure, what is

13:39.043 --> 13:40.966
happening? You know, on our case, we're not 
bothering anybody. So Luthor, perhaps we ought to

13:45.471 --> 13:48.495
just go to Europe and hide out. Do like we did 
before. If

13:52.447 --> 14:02.221
Lou John and I go into a room for two weeks, 
something's going to come out at the end of it. A

14:02.261 --> 14:03.543
whole lot. We always knew that. We could turn on 
material instantly. Tons of our stuff had never

14:11.594 --> 14:13.237
even recorded. We'd practice it, and then once we 
had it down, we lost interest. And then the things

14:17.905 --> 14:21.490
that are really a challenge, let's see if we can 
make this work. Remember what we were trying to do

14:21.510 --> 14:25.336
the other night? Let's see if we can get that to be 
something. So then we go do that with great energy

14:28.581 --> 14:36.672
and forget all the things that we rehearsed that 
we're supposed to be recording. That's good and

14:36.692 --> 14:37.954
it's bad. Recorded pieces often don't sound 
really polished. That's good and it's bad.

14:47.639 --> 14:53.026
But it does have the benefit of, let's say, sincere 
energy. It is fresh and you have some desire. Like

14:56.491 --> 14:59.534
that Rolling Stones thing, it's only rock and 
roll, but I like it. The way that sounds sounded to

15:01.437 --> 15:07.224
me like they must have hashed that out the way we 
used to. There's so much more that it needs or could

15:07.244 --> 15:09.968
have. That could have been a really slick, major 
Rolling Stone effort. But it wasn't. They were

15:16.332 --> 15:18.234
content to leave it as it was. I like it fine. It's 
only rock and roll, but I like it. And that's all.

15:27.122 --> 15:31.326
The way the song is reflects exactly what it's 
talking about. Is it rock and roll? Yeah. Well,

15:32.667 --> 15:33.448
that's good enough. That's all this is. I like it. 
You think it ought to have horns. You think it ought

15:36.110 --> 15:37.471
to have a better bass part. You think it ought to 
have a guitar solo. Too bad, it doesn't. Still,

15:41.769 --> 15:43.932
rock and roll, this is all you get. And we always 
avoided the gratuitous guitar fill.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.661
I always hate guitar fills. I like them. I think 
they're great. One, appropriate. But every time

15:57.726 --> 16:04.093
the singer stops, isn't the signal for the guitar 
player to start flapping? So we avoided that

16:04.113 --> 16:05.394
pretty much. You know, it's all our songs. That's a 
tendency picked up by the new wavers. They avoid

16:12.012 --> 16:17.439
the fills religiously. It's nice to have a little 
running riff. Oh, it's nice to throw a fill in here

16:20.163 --> 16:24.509
and there. But that sounds too much like the 
electric blues freaks who were running wild in the

16:24.529 --> 16:31.559
60s, too. I contended that the blues revival was 
over because they played all the notes. There were

16:36.702 --> 16:40.866
no notes left in any combination that hadn't been 
played. The entire permutation had been strung

16:41.347 --> 16:44.270
out. It was impossible to play two musical phrases 
that hadn't been played by somebody sometime or

16:45.531 --> 16:51.777
other. I said, therefore, give it up. I have to find 
something else. John Carroll playing blues, when

16:58.203 --> 17:01.186
he first came over from England, that would have 
been terrific. He didn't know any blues works. The

17:05.255 --> 17:07.577
Welshman Sings the Blues.

17:09.740 --> 17:10.701
That would appeal to me. The Welsh academician 
sings the blues. Sings American Negro blues. That

17:17.868 --> 17:19.690
would have been a great album. That would have 
astounded everybody. I can't imagine what it

17:21.792 --> 17:27.038
would have been. But you know what I mean. If you 
can't avoid cliches no matter how hard you try,

17:29.701 --> 17:34.806
then you really ought to I ride a different horse 
and mix my metaphors. Who wants to play electric

17:40.174 --> 17:41.375
blues? All I can do is play it as well as Johnny 
Winter did it last week. Maybe not as well, but

17:48.505 --> 17:51.289
better. Just, oh yeah, yeah, that's clearly 
influenced by it. It's impossible to be totally

17:55.555 --> 17:56.957
original. You don't have to be totally derivative 
either. A good blues band was Siegel Schwal.

18:03.246 --> 18:04.708
Chicago guys, white. religious blues purists. 
Sound good.

18:14.021 --> 18:20.431
Kind of like early Butterfield, but even more 
rooted, shall I say.

18:23.295 --> 18:25.117
You know what I say about that? Is this thing 
picking up anything? It should be. I think it's

18:27.921 --> 18:28.422
over. I don't know. I have a way of swallowing my 
words. Okay. Okay, finis. That's it. Now we can go

18:35.012 --> 18:35.893
over to the union.
