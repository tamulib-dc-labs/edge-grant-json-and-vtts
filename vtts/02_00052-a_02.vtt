WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:05.409
It took me a long while to get used to the potlucks.

00:06.030 --> 00:11.441
You know, we have a potluck, somebody's leaving, somebody has a baby, somebody gets married.

00:12.162 --> 00:14.427
We had a potluck one time when no one was leaving.

00:15.509 --> 00:19.778
And they start at about 11.30 and they don't end until about 2.

00:20.551 --> 00:30.386
And my style was pretty, you know, have a lot of balls bounce in the air a lot of time, and I really had to get used to this.

00:30.406 --> 00:36.276
I also had to get used to the way students responded coming out of Maryland and Vermont.

00:37.658 --> 00:38.840
And I always taught a class.

00:38.940 --> 00:43.928
I've never had any year while I've been an administrator where I didn't teach.

00:44.308 --> 00:48.094
And in the dean's office, every associate taught as well.

00:48.817 --> 00:51.180
I couldn't do it during the day, but I did it in the evening.

00:51.401 --> 01:02.375
One of the things that I found is people don't talk back to you if you're a professor, and they call you sir.

01:02.756 --> 01:07.923
And what I was used to, you know, it didn't make much difference if you were a professor or not.

01:07.963 --> 01:12.730
In Maryland, especially, you were challenged.

01:13.170 --> 01:15.313
In fact, I have had students in my classes

01:16.238 --> 01:19.843
take the chalk out of my hand and cross out stuff that I'd written on the board.

01:20.243 --> 01:21.044
And I love that.

01:21.164 --> 01:21.805
I love that.

01:24.248 --> 01:29.254
And also, people, I can remember the first department meeting.

01:33.680 --> 01:42.651
We sat around and I said to them, I said to the department heads, I said, you know, you've been here a lot longer than I have.

01:43.610 --> 01:46.575
What do you think we ought to do about this?"

01:47.698 --> 01:51.986
And I could see him looking at me, you know, does this guy really mean it?

01:52.406 --> 01:58.878
About six months after that, Len Ponder, who was one of the department heads, said, you know, we talked about this after we met.

01:58.999 --> 02:00.461
We said, what the hell we got here?

02:00.521 --> 02:04.809
This guy is our dean and he's asking us what we should do?

02:04.849 --> 02:06.833
What are we doing?

02:06.813 --> 02:18.274
And my style was a little different than the previous deans, although he was very effective.

02:19.503 --> 02:23.167
But they had to put up with me with that.

02:23.708 --> 02:28.273
And we later got to a real commitment with sharing.

02:29.014 --> 02:33.759
I got to the point with the department heads where they were actually sharing their budgets with each other.

02:34.480 --> 02:38.344
And we'd have ends of the lines which we'd swap and all of that.

02:39.165 --> 02:42.289
And we had very great involvement of the faculty.

02:42.309 --> 02:46.033
We created something called Centers of Inquiry.

02:46.013 --> 02:50.664
And one of the great things about this place were the resources we had.

02:50.704 --> 03:02.031
And out of our retreat, our first retreat, came the idea that we ought to create these centers of inquiry which were centers of interest that the faculty could develop.

03:02.011 --> 03:14.520
And so I took all the discretionary money I could find and I gave it to this faculty oversight committee to stimulate inquiry, including research.

03:14.660 --> 03:18.028
We didn't want to use the term research because we felt that inquiry

03:18.008 --> 03:20.213
Research was one type of inquiry.

03:20.233 --> 03:25.144
And when you mentioned research in those days, people kept thinking of experimental groups and all of that.

03:25.665 --> 03:31.478
What we were talking about was developing new courses, delving into computers.

03:31.558 --> 03:33.823
In those days, we didn't have any computers.

03:34.529 --> 03:38.858
But what we did, that was one of the first inquiry areas that was set up.

03:39.278 --> 03:40.160
What do we need to do?

03:40.200 --> 03:53.787
And the first committee that had 22 people on it, that represented all departments, came up with this inquiry group report on what the college ought to do in the area of computers.

03:53.767 --> 03:58.072
They came out with 21 recommendations around four areas.

03:58.273 --> 04:09.627
One was new courses we needed, new equipment we needed, professional development that we needed for the faculty, and then how we should use it with research.

04:10.147 --> 04:13.592
And talk about the luck of a new dean.

04:13.612 --> 04:18.778
The day the committee handed me the report, the Friday afternoon,

04:19.552 --> 04:24.959
that they handed me their report, I got a call from Chuck McCandless.

04:25.520 --> 04:31.589
And Chuck said, Dean, if you had $93,000 to spend for computers, how would you spend it?

04:32.690 --> 04:41.823
And I said, Chuck, you won't believe this, but I have here the best report I've ever received from a faculty group on what the college ought to be doing in the next five years in the area of computers.

04:42.223 --> 04:45.288
If you'll give us the weekend, we'll get you a budget by Monday morning.

04:45.908 --> 04:48.512
So I brought the inquiry group back together.

04:49.825 --> 05:04.058
We took these 21, they were very specific recommendations, like bringing in people from other places who could teach us, getting IBM to give us some free computers, creating a research assistance lab.

05:04.118 --> 05:05.461
I mean, they were very specific.

05:05.983 --> 05:07.446
So you could put a budget with them.

05:08.607 --> 05:17.368
We later found that these inquiry groups, even though we set them up as professional development activities, became wonderful sources for writing grants.

05:17.388 --> 05:21.418
Because if you can identify areas that the faculty is interested in,

05:22.529 --> 05:24.471
And you've got people to do it.

05:24.631 --> 05:28.515
If you get the money, it's a heck of a lot better than just writing a proposal to get the money.

05:28.555 --> 05:32.339
You're writing a proposal to get the money that the faculty want to do.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.042
So anyway, we put together a budget for $113,000.

05:36.563 --> 05:39.546
We thought there's money over there.

05:39.566 --> 05:41.208
We might get a little more.

05:43.731 --> 05:51.118
By the Wednesday of the fall, after the Friday they submitted the report, I was able to go back to this group and tell them,

05:51.098 --> 05:56.267
that the institution had come up with $113,000 to implement their ideas.

05:57.068 --> 05:59.652
There's nothing sweeter than that.

05:59.793 --> 06:08.928
Because so many times, faculty spend time on creative ideas and committees that don't go anywhere, because you don't have the money.

06:10.030 --> 06:12.955
When you got here, as you saw

06:14.082 --> 06:19.251
the budget and the salaries and so forth, how did we compare?

06:19.331 --> 06:20.373
Compare it very well.

06:21.916 --> 06:25.002
But also in terms of fairness across colleges.

06:26.825 --> 06:34.639
And the resources, well you remember in those days, one of those years we got a raise in the middle of the year.

06:34.619 --> 06:37.743
the 9% in January?

06:37.763 --> 06:39.505
I mean, that was unheard of.

06:39.525 --> 06:43.209
I'm not going to ask you your salary any other time.

06:43.229 --> 06:44.310
What was your beginning salary?

06:44.330 --> 06:51.759
Beginning salary I think was $40-something, $45,000, something like that.

06:52.720 --> 06:57.346
But I never have taken in my life a job on the business salary.

06:57.486 --> 07:00.289
I've always gone to a place where I felt I could do

07:01.349 --> 07:08.838
what I thought I needed to be doing as a professional and where the challenges were there.

07:08.858 --> 07:10.880
And it was like that experience.

07:13.223 --> 07:14.865
In fact, my whole life has been that way.

07:17.649 --> 07:19.851
Someone said, I will help you.

07:19.971 --> 07:22.935
And everybody else has done this for me, I mean with me.

07:23.455 --> 07:32.529
That's why when I heard one of our Board of Regents members one time say he was a self-made man, I went up to him after and said, I don't think so.

07:33.170 --> 07:35.815
I think if we probe a little further, you'll admit.

07:35.835 --> 07:49.817
In fact, one time, just for the heck of it, we were having a meeting with the deans, and I asked them, who were the three people that influenced their life the most?

07:49.797 --> 07:52.260
Every one of them had a teacher.

07:52.280 --> 07:56.165
Every one of them had a Mrs. Finnegan.

07:56.185 --> 07:57.947
And that's the way it's been with me.

07:58.267 --> 08:05.496
I never had to go to the Chronicle to get a job.

08:05.616 --> 08:08.379
It always ended up like kind of in your situation.

08:08.399 --> 08:12.304
Someone calls, your advisor says, this is open, you're ready for a new experience.

08:13.505 --> 08:16.108
And I have never left

08:17.759 --> 08:19.443
because of the money.

08:20.425 --> 08:23.673
And here, I mean, the resources compared to other places.

08:24.154 --> 08:29.767
The problem is that the faculty oftentimes in the place they're in don't know how bad it is.

08:31.210 --> 08:34.317
In Vermont, we had three faculty to an office.

08:34.634 --> 08:38.839
I mean, here, every faculty member had an office.

08:40.460 --> 08:50.972
When we started to develop the computer thing, we got 55 computers free from IBM, and we had something like 100 faculty wanting to do this.

08:51.532 --> 08:54.896
We brought in a guy from Wellesland to spend the summer with us.

08:55.737 --> 09:03.105
We brought in the associate dean from Michigan State to help us get set up with computers.

09:03.085 --> 09:05.989
resources here, you know.

09:06.770 --> 09:09.254
But it was all based on faculty.

09:10.676 --> 09:15.603
I've always believed that the faculty needs to be committed to these kinds of things.

09:15.703 --> 09:16.364
It's gonna work.

09:17.326 --> 09:25.718
And the whole philosophy of this report was to infuse computers into the life of the college, not to create a separate department.

09:26.677 --> 09:27.779
And that's what happened.

09:28.340 --> 09:33.307
But without the resources, what we began to talk about were workstations.

09:35.631 --> 09:45.826
And the institution started to think about what you need in a workstation to create an effective environment for teaching and research.

09:46.988 --> 09:48.831
And that was the notion.

09:48.891 --> 09:51.655
It was all based on a well thought out

09:52.411 --> 10:01.629
plan that had at the base of it a philosophy, which was a philosophy of sharing, reflecting, evaluating.

10:02.751 --> 10:13.913
As you are getting started, did you get any advice, either sought or unsought advice, from Vice President Prescott, President Miller, Chancellor Huber?

10:15.783 --> 10:18.808
This was the thing that was different about this place.

10:19.148 --> 10:39.138
Even though it was viewed as being highly hierarchical and military from the past history, the advantage of this communication system was that when you asked somebody for something, you got an immediate response.

10:40.320 --> 10:45.047
From the time I came here, I could pick up the phone, not write a letter,

10:46.546 --> 10:51.634
pick up the phone and call the provost's office and get an answer.

10:53.356 --> 10:56.121
And this started with Mac Prescott.

10:56.261 --> 11:04.133
And what I liked about Mac so much was that he had such integrity.

11:04.273 --> 11:05.555
He exuded integrity.

11:05.675 --> 11:10.863
If you asked him something, he'd give you an answer, and you could count on it.

11:11.164 --> 11:13.347
You could take it to the bank.

11:14.069 --> 11:15.652
And he might not even agree with you.

11:15.772 --> 11:24.827
I had a big debate with him one time about wanting to set up experimental high schools, what we were calling teaching centers in those days.

11:25.067 --> 11:29.835
They now call them professional development schools in Houston.

11:29.855 --> 11:36.606
And he wondered why we wanted to go way off campus and have these sites in Houston.

11:36.666 --> 11:40.212
And my pitch was, well, we need to have an urban connection.

11:40.715 --> 11:41.756
And we need to be there.

11:42.377 --> 11:52.206
And what he was worried about was in those days we had this ruling geographically that you couldn't go into some other state university's territory.

11:53.568 --> 11:59.834
And of course, Billy Reagan was saying, I can have people from Harvard and Stanford and Princeton come here and work, but I can't have A&M.

11:59.914 --> 12:04.738
And I want A&M because they've got the people willing to work with us.

12:05.860 --> 12:10.384
He was having trouble getting to the University of Houston until we decided we wanted to go down there.

12:10.364 --> 12:15.590
Then all of a sudden, they wanted to work more closely with him.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.653
Anyway, but he finally said to me, you want to do this?

12:18.953 --> 12:19.314
Fine.

12:19.754 --> 12:20.235
We'll do it.

12:20.315 --> 12:26.762
But I still don't agree with him.

12:26.782 --> 12:31.126
Hubert, from the time I came, first thing he told me, we had a meeting with him.

12:32.788 --> 12:34.570
We were going someplace down at McAllen.

12:34.610 --> 12:36.552
He said, now, this is yours.

12:37.093 --> 12:38.194
Don't ask me

12:39.777 --> 12:43.223
anything about what you ought to do.

12:43.456 --> 12:44.798
You do what you want to do.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.803
Now, I only asked him one question.

12:48.945 --> 12:55.415
I said, what did you have in mind when you created this interdisciplinary studies area?

12:56.597 --> 12:58.019
Because it had vocab in it.

12:58.039 --> 12:59.201
It had industrial ad.

12:59.221 --> 13:00.623
You remember that in the old days?

13:01.845 --> 13:10.138
He said, well, we had a chance to get 18 NDEA fellowships, and I needed a place to put them.

13:10.861 --> 13:15.266
But if you think we ought to do away with it now, that's yours, right?

13:16.427 --> 13:22.373
He never once contacted me about anything or suggested anything.

13:23.094 --> 13:25.757
I communicated with him on a social basis.

13:27.018 --> 13:30.722
But I never once asked him about any of it.

13:30.742 --> 13:34.506
And when I left the deanship, I purposely did that too.

13:34.526 --> 13:36.108
In fact, I moved to a different building.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.050
I moved to Blocker.

13:39.312 --> 13:45.943
Right about the time you arrived, Dr. Miller ceased being president.

13:46.003 --> 13:48.627
Chuck Sampson came in.

13:48.947 --> 13:51.151
Did that have any effect on you?

13:51.391 --> 13:51.972
Not at all.

13:52.433 --> 13:58.603
I got back to Maryland and on my way to the airport I learned that Miller had

13:58.803 --> 14:10.821
had been relieved of his job by Hubert because of the debate over where Extension and Experiment Station ought to report.

14:11.122 --> 14:22.380
Was the College of Education organized by departments, et cetera, in the fashion that you thought was reasonably appropriate?

14:22.981 --> 14:28.911
Well, what we did, we looked at, and we started right out in our retreat.

14:28.891 --> 14:38.701
to develop ways that we could create cross-departmental communication, which has always been a belief of mine.

14:38.741 --> 14:47.049
The integration of ideas is so essential, and you can't just go to one department, especially in something like education.

14:47.089 --> 14:49.612
You take the area of special needs.

14:49.992 --> 14:51.293
You've got curriculum issues.

14:51.994 --> 14:54.156
You've got legal questions.

14:54.256 --> 14:58.020
You've got questions of administration, evaluation.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.502
And then all in one department.

14:59.522 --> 15:01.104
So you've got to get the people together.

15:03.087 --> 15:06.192
And at Vermont, we did away with departments to do this.

15:06.312 --> 15:08.816
We had here and in Maryland.

15:08.836 --> 15:17.528
Marilyn and I had set up institutes where people could create institutes of and faculties of.

15:18.014 --> 15:19.716
And they weren't departmental only.

15:19.756 --> 15:25.744
Here, we created these centers of inquiry, see, which became interdepartmental.

15:26.385 --> 15:35.217
And we always had the inquiry groups report through the Faculty Development Council.

15:36.278 --> 15:39.783
So the department heads were always involved in this.

15:41.044 --> 15:43.988
And the inquiry groups came out of the faculty.

15:45.014 --> 15:59.355
They first did this oversight group, which was selected at the retreat, selected Mike Ash as the first chair of the inquiry activity.

16:00.056 --> 16:03.260
First thing they did was a survey of what were the interest areas.

16:04.522 --> 16:13.435
And then the second, after three years, Dave Olson became the Oversight Committee Chair.

16:13.870 --> 16:16.493
And that became a wonderful training ground for new leadership.

16:17.174 --> 16:22.219
Mike went from that to become department head when Borman moved into the office as associate dean.

16:23.180 --> 16:30.948
And then Erlinson became dean of the Department of Educational Administration when Hawkins left.

16:30.968 --> 16:41.920
So these activities, which were cross-departmental, and then when they became department heads, they were extra sensitive to cross-departmental

16:42.170 --> 16:42.792
activity.

16:43.053 --> 16:45.281
This sounds like it was all planned.

16:45.903 --> 16:49.395
It was another thing that just worked out well.

16:49.915 --> 16:59.108
But the organization with the inquiry groups, the inquiry groups solved what I've always believed.

16:59.128 --> 17:03.134
Because as a dean, I'm sure you had this experience as a provost, too.

17:04.196 --> 17:16.193
I found that when somebody asked me what is it that deans do, I would always come up with the notion that what deans do is 90% of that time is spent linking

17:16.173 --> 17:17.877
Connecting.

17:18.719 --> 17:20.063
Connecting faculty.

17:20.524 --> 17:22.068
You've got faculty in different departments.

17:22.128 --> 17:27.381
And faculty in the same department sometimes, with somebody five doors down the hall,

17:27.901 --> 17:30.766
working in the same area and they don't talk to each other about it.

17:30.967 --> 17:43.509
So as a dean, you see the whole college and you see that here's somebody over in psych who's got the same interests as somebody in curriculum and instruction and somebody in human resources.

17:44.211 --> 17:46.635
And then you take the whole university.

17:46.615 --> 17:50.140
And you, well, take genetics, for example, here at A&M.

17:50.160 --> 17:53.806
There are 40 departments that have faculty members doing something.

17:53.826 --> 17:57.671
Even the philosophy department has somebody doing ethics of DNA.

17:58.132 --> 18:00.195
So you've got to find ways, structurally.

18:00.796 --> 18:02.118
And we used team teaching.

18:02.238 --> 18:05.022
We used this interdisciplinary area.

18:05.042 --> 18:12.353
What we did, we put a lot of courses that graduate students from each department would take.

18:12.333 --> 18:22.885
And we developed a system where the credit hour count would be returned to the department of the faculty member teaching the course, even though it wasn't taught in their department.

18:24.027 --> 18:25.468
And it was easy to do here.

18:25.488 --> 18:28.132
See, that would have taken me three months at Maryland.

18:28.152 --> 18:35.320
I would have had to have written letters back and forth, but it was easy to pull off.

18:35.755 --> 18:40.501
But I didn't want to move toward eliminating departments.

18:40.561 --> 18:43.285
First, the faculty wasn't too excited about it.

18:43.765 --> 18:47.871
And second, in a bigger institution like this, you might lose your budget.

18:48.752 --> 18:53.918
The departments you inherited, summarize those.

18:54.679 --> 19:00.767
Department of Educational Administration, Hal Hawkins was chair, and Department of Educational Psychology,

19:01.692 --> 19:10.397
Department of Curriculum and Instruction, Department of Interdisciplinary Studies, Department of Health and Physical Education.

19:10.998 --> 19:12.202
Those were the departments.

19:12.262 --> 19:14.910
Special Ed was in Ed Psych.

19:14.930 --> 19:16.815
It wasn't a separate department.

19:16.795 --> 19:26.830
Ag Ed was in agriculture, but we treated it just like a department in the College of Education.

19:26.870 --> 19:37.705
They had their department person in Ag Ed and it really worked very well because of the people.

19:38.186 --> 19:40.930
Herman Brown was chair.

19:40.910 --> 19:43.876
Industrial ed was not in industrial engineering.

19:43.916 --> 19:49.687
It was the interdisciplinary ed department, and that department had a mixture.

19:49.748 --> 20:02.513
It was kind of a smorgasbord of industrial ed, ed tech, and vocational education was all in that department.

20:03.320 --> 20:10.848
You expected the department heads to act as head or as chairman?

20:11.129 --> 20:15.574
They were heads because they made budgetary decisions.

20:16.855 --> 20:22.782
They knew they were responsible for the hiring and development.

20:22.962 --> 20:26.526
They knew that they were responsible for the students.

20:26.506 --> 20:29.550
graduate and advising and all of this.

20:30.571 --> 20:34.456
And we stuck with that.

20:36.138 --> 20:46.291
And we had a lot of sessions, developmental sessions with the departments on promotion and tenure policies and things like this.

20:47.652 --> 20:49.695
And then we used the inquiry groups

20:50.519 --> 20:54.487
to do a lot of the cross-departmental development stuff.

20:55.248 --> 21:01.500
We used to have two conferences a year just for college faculty and students, in which they would share their inquiry.

21:02.161 --> 21:06.029
And then the third year, we started to invite people from the schools in.

21:06.851 --> 21:10.738
And we'd have a conference over at the community center or the Brazos County thing.

21:10.988 --> 21:21.858
And the reason we did this, we were meeting faculty at these national conferences, giving papers from our own faculty, and didn't know until we got to the national meeting.

21:21.898 --> 21:24.620
So we said, let's have our own inquiry conference.

21:24.640 --> 21:30.925
So we had these conferences, and whatever people were working on in terms of their inquiry areas, they'd share them with everybody else.

21:31.026 --> 21:32.147
And we'd have panels.

21:32.247 --> 21:39.493
And it was all set up by the faculty inquiry activity, not the dean's office.

21:40.165 --> 21:45.438
And I've always believed that you don't run programs out of the dean's office.

21:45.578 --> 21:54.340
That even if it's an interdisciplinary program, it has to be situated in a department, because that's where your faculty workloads are formed.

21:54.380 --> 21:56.605
It's not getting the dean's

21:57.040 --> 21:59.683
assigning people to tasks.

22:02.146 --> 22:08.213
That was a little different than sometimes they'd been used to, but I've always believed that.

22:08.594 --> 22:16.524
And if you can get to your department heads to see themselves as college leaders, not just department leaders, then they are going to be willing.

22:16.544 --> 22:23.932
Like, we located the Research Assistance Lab in Ed Psych, but it served all the different departments.

22:24.713 --> 22:26.035
Did you have another

22:26.690 --> 22:28.412
College of Education as a model?

22:30.655 --> 22:31.036
Did you have any?

22:31.056 --> 22:38.747
No, I just had the belief that faculty needed to develop what made sense.

22:39.768 --> 22:49.702
And I believe that you can't, that each organization and each program must emerge from the setting in which it's going to operate.

22:50.483 --> 22:54.408
See, at Vermont, we were going to merge social work.

22:54.428 --> 22:56.511
I hired 58 new faculty.

22:57.115 --> 22:59.942
And there were only 21 people there when I went there.

23:00.243 --> 23:02.108
So we went off for a three day retreat.

23:02.148 --> 23:04.635
It ended up a five day retreat because we got snowed in.

23:04.675 --> 23:08.104
And by the time we came back from that retreat,

23:08.641 --> 23:11.345
The faculty had decided that they didn't want to have departments.

23:11.365 --> 23:12.667
They wanted these program areas.

23:13.208 --> 23:21.159
And so I went in to see Al Rawlins, who was the provost, and I said, Al, the faculty has just decided we ought to do away with departments.

23:21.179 --> 23:22.741
We're going to try a new organization.

23:23.182 --> 23:29.210
And his response was, he kind of sweeps his hands together like this, and he said, boy, that ought to be fun.

23:31.834 --> 23:36.741
And he later became president at Old Dominion, one of my good buddies.

23:38.290 --> 23:41.437
When did you begin to think you were making progress?

23:43.982 --> 23:53.782
I felt right off at the retreat when we got such an enthusiastic response to the ideas.

23:54.644 --> 23:59.033
And the way people dealt with each other.

23:59.705 --> 24:03.149
Lots of respect for each other across departments.

24:04.050 --> 24:06.753
Very professional, you know.

24:07.593 --> 24:08.755
Great, great ideas.

24:08.975 --> 24:25.813
One of the things that came out of the, actually it was the first retreat, was the idea of setting up connections with school districts, where we'd get the school districts to come up with some money, we'd come up with some money, and we'd have teachers doing research.

24:25.793 --> 24:30.108
not just faculty members, where the actual principal investigator would be a teacher.

24:31.111 --> 24:35.145
And then we'd have these conferences where the teachers would report to each other,

24:35.783 --> 24:40.592
And we got 12 superintendents and 12 districts to join together.

24:40.672 --> 24:49.088
Jim McNamara actually headed it up its first few years, where they actually did studies of dropouts and stuff, which they shared with each other.

24:50.190 --> 24:56.442
You know, school districts weren't doing a lot of that sharing, especially that kind of information.

24:56.422 --> 25:12.388
And so we were able to build a structure to connect us around inquiry with school districts so that our, you know, profession itself

25:12.368 --> 25:15.494
And we had a lot of people in leadership roles.

25:15.515 --> 25:17.859
You know, we always had the School Boards Institute here.

25:18.401 --> 25:19.783
Hubert had set all of this up.

25:19.803 --> 25:31.187
We had the academic administrators, the training thing that he had worked with years and that you and Brian, you know, the program that Brian Cole now had.

25:31.167 --> 25:34.291
And then we had the superintendent's conference here.

25:34.732 --> 25:40.760
So there were a lot of connections already developed that linked us with our professional groups.

25:41.741 --> 25:47.869
And what I found from the day I came here, that I was viewed by the state as a state leader.

25:48.250 --> 25:50.673
Hubert had developed that.

25:51.534 --> 25:55.920
The institution had developed wonderful relationships with the state education department.

25:55.940 --> 25:58.103
When Bowen, you remember, was commissioner.

25:58.083 --> 26:01.330
He and Hubert worked very closely together.

26:02.272 --> 26:12.272
And that kind of helped me because I got very active working with the TEA, Texas Education Agency.

26:12.412 --> 26:15.298
And then when the parole committee was created, I was

26:15.278 --> 26:17.160
asked to be on the parole committee.

26:17.560 --> 26:27.049
I was the only educator on the committee, which turned out to be one of the most interesting experiences of my life, going all over the state with him for ten and a half months.

26:28.971 --> 26:30.833
I could write a book about that experience.

26:31.293 --> 26:39.701
But the college was in a position of being a state leader.

26:39.801 --> 26:44.205
When we get into the business of reforming teacher education,

26:44.185 --> 26:48.291
We became the center for the Holmes Group.

26:48.431 --> 26:58.386
The Holmes Group was created with about 100 of the major universities in the United States to take a look at their teacher education programs.

26:59.428 --> 27:07.780
We worked with six of the other institutions in the state, Texas Tech, Baylor,

27:07.760 --> 27:11.625
Trinity, UT, UMH, and ourselves.

27:12.826 --> 27:27.986
And we were moving ahead to create some really interesting five-year programs in teacher ed where we'd have a good general education and a major in a discipline for four years and then create a professional year and then a three-year induction period.

27:29.227 --> 27:33.092
And we were moving pretty fast on that until we bumped into Senator Parker.

27:34.237 --> 27:38.622
And that was at the time after the parole committee.

27:39.823 --> 27:54.419
They created another committee to study teacher education, and he came up with this bill, Senate Bill 94, which said that no teacher should be taking more than 18 credit hours in education.

27:54.439 --> 27:56.321
So that was Senator Parker.

27:57.762 --> 28:01.446
Senator Parker didn't have a very healthy view of colleges of education.

28:01.486 --> 28:03.889
He made a statement one time that if

28:03.869 --> 28:10.740
If prostitutes, drug dealers, and deans of education are against him, he knew he was on the right side.

28:12.796 --> 28:17.401
But that was another example of how this institution stuck by me.

28:19.423 --> 28:37.704
We had spent two years developing with our faculty, not just in teacher ed, but the whole college and people in the arts and sciences, as you know, in colleges of education, students take their majors outside of the college in the disciplines.

28:37.744 --> 28:39.126
So you had math, science.

28:39.286 --> 28:40.407
We had 29

28:41.213 --> 28:48.349
fields of study outside the College of Education in four different colleges, four other colleges.

28:48.369 --> 28:51.376
So we had good collaboration from the other colleges.

28:51.516 --> 28:53.721
And we spent two years

28:54.190 --> 29:02.520
That little book up there is a report of the national conference we had on the future of teacher education here.

29:03.161 --> 29:07.226
We brought on all the top people in the country here, and we came up with this plan.

29:08.247 --> 29:14.815
And the faculty approved it unanimously, not just in curriculum instruction, but all of them.

29:15.737 --> 29:18.620
So we went to the coordinating board to get this approved.

29:18.680 --> 29:21.784
About the same time they passed this legislation.

29:21.764 --> 29:30.121
There was nothing in the bill that said that you had to have a four-year program if you're going to develop a five-year program.

29:30.141 --> 29:37.275
But the way Parker interpreted it, he interpreted it to say that you had to have a four-year program

29:38.200 --> 29:39.964
along with your five-year program.

29:40.465 --> 29:48.163
And our view was that you ought to have some institutions that aren't just doing teacher education, they're doing research on teacher education.

29:48.784 --> 29:52.733
And that we ought to be leading the nation, institutions like this,

29:53.152 --> 29:54.294
And these five others.

29:54.975 --> 30:01.605
Well, anyway, we put the coordinating head of Ashworth in a tough position there.

30:01.645 --> 30:03.448
He was between Parker and us.

30:04.690 --> 30:07.034
And so we had a big meeting with him.

30:07.054 --> 30:10.840
He wanted us to back off.

30:11.343 --> 30:15.389
The provost office here went with me and they said, no, don't back off.

30:16.171 --> 30:23.582
If the legislature starts getting into the position of thinking they can prescribe programs for teacher ed, they might think they can do it for all programs.

30:23.622 --> 30:25.826
And that's not what legislators ought to be doing.

30:27.789 --> 30:31.935
Prescribing courses in medicine and law and business.

30:32.636 --> 30:36.282
So the issue wasn't our program necessarily.

30:36.442 --> 30:39.527
The issue became with them, we don't want

30:40.081 --> 30:45.726
state legislators deciding that we ought to have so many credit hours in this professional program.

30:46.387 --> 30:55.575
So we made a deal with Ashworth that he would get the coordinating board to approve our five-year program, and we had agreed to go ahead and develop a four-year program.

30:56.315 --> 31:02.601
We wouldn't have to recommend anybody take it, because you can't prepare an elementary ed teacher in 18 hours.

31:04.322 --> 31:07.125
So anyway, we did.

31:07.205 --> 31:09.767
And the coordinating board approved it.

31:10.203 --> 31:14.851
We were the only program, because we were ready that they approved.

31:14.871 --> 31:22.124
By the time the other institutions got around, you couldn't get it through.

31:22.805 --> 31:24.448
And UT backed off anyway.

31:25.810 --> 31:32.802
When you got here, what image did you get statewide?

31:33.963 --> 31:37.329
for Texas A&M's education program.

31:37.349 --> 31:38.972
What was our image in 1980?

31:38.992 --> 31:39.994
Image in 1980 was very good.

31:41.436 --> 31:44.842
They sung the praises of the graduates of this institution.

31:46.184 --> 31:54.379
Every school district that I talked with, of course, when I traveled, in 83, three years after I got here, I traveled all over the state.

31:55.300 --> 31:56.342
So I got a good
