WEBVTT

00:01.685 --> 00:02.787
Mr. C.A. Bonin, side two. We were talking about the 
school board. And in 1944, you became on the school

00:09.717 --> 00:14.705
board. What facilities did you have at that time? 
There's some wooden buildings.

00:23.538 --> 00:24.981
They're all gone now. They're over here where the 
present school and where the city.

00:38.337 --> 00:44.223
That was the one that fronts on Jersey. The city 
owns that now. But the school owns the building

00:47.327 --> 00:52.252
back of it. So in 1944, there were only wooden 
shacks in that area?

00:59.480 --> 01:01.622
Or wooden buildings, I'm sorry. After 1940, those 
wooden buildings were built. See, that's when we

01:09.404 --> 01:11.626
were ordered off the campus. Right. And

01:13.769 --> 01:30.567
I think all those buildings are gone now except the 
old gymnasium.

01:30.907 --> 01:36.053
In 49, do you remember that the school district 
decided to build a more permanent building? It's

01:41.526 --> 01:44.991
the one that the city owns now. It's the one that is 
the community center now? Yeah. Can you tell me a

01:48.195 --> 01:58.148
little bit about how you and the superintendent 
went about deciding on how to build this building?

02:00.311 --> 02:04.757
We visited a lot of campuses, high school 
campuses.

02:07.859 --> 02:29.100
And

02:07.859 --> 02:29.100
I imagine this, which is now the city building, was 
built according to the ideas that he and I picked up

02:07.859 --> 02:29.100
around these different campuses. What we liked, 
what we didn't like, and what we could afford and

02:29.120 --> 02:34.626
all that sort of thing. this building and

02:37.171 --> 02:56.629
the Lincoln School were both built out of a bond 
issue of a little over, I think it was $110,000 that

02:37.171 --> 02:56.629
we had to work with. The school board's bond 
election? It was the school board? Yeah. Or was it

03:03.056 --> 03:04.557
the city? No, the school board. Was it at this time 
that you had to double the tax rate on the property

03:07.495 --> 03:15.166
in order to get enough money? No, that was when we 
ordered off the campus. That was Bill Sparks and I.

03:24.078 --> 03:33.030
We were the main ones and

03:24.078 --> 03:33.030
we were active when the rest of the school board was 
left it up to us to do the work. But in 49, when you

03:39.852 --> 03:46.662
built the school that is presently the community 
center, you had a $110,000 bond? Yeah, a little

03:46.683 --> 03:51.570
over $100,000, if I remember. To provide for? Both 
schools, one down in Lincoln and here. Lincoln was

03:57.226 --> 03:59.853
the Negro facility? Why were they separate? We 
just grew up that way. It had always been that way?

04:07.595 --> 04:09.801
Always been that way.

04:26.183 --> 04:33.393
before the integration of the black schools and 
the white schools. Where were other facilities?

04:36.598 --> 04:41.245
Do you remember other negro facilities before 
Lincoln School was built?

04:44.089 --> 04:55.245
Well,

04:44.089 --> 04:55.245
I remember there was a school there for the 
negroes.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.954
But it was kind of ramshackle. Where was that 
located? Right where they,

05:00.676 --> 05:07.605
approximately where the Lincoln School is now. 
Oh, okay. So they had an area where Lincoln is, and

05:10.248 --> 05:17.337
in 1949 they built Lincoln School also. Yeah. Do 
you remember when the schools were integrated

05:19.039 --> 05:25.688
here in College Station? No, but I'm in and you can 
find out. It

05:31.786 --> 05:37.933
wasn't too long ago, you know. It wasn't too long 
ago? No. I think you can find that over at the city.

05:45.943 --> 05:51.450
Did some of College Station students go to Bryan, 
to the Bryan School District? A few did, not many.

05:53.579 --> 05:57.364
How would you compare the two districts? That's 
hard to do. They were an old, well-organized

06:02.792 --> 06:08.760
school district. We were young.

06:15.249 --> 06:21.358
No money to spend on school, but we had good 
teachers. And that's mostly what a school's made

06:23.110 --> 06:40.535
of, the teachers

06:23.110 --> 06:40.535
and the people that build the schools and so on.

06:40.555 --> 06:50.569
We were a pretty select group out here, mostly 
faculty members on the campus.

06:51.848 --> 07:12.979
Mr. Gabbard and George Wilcox and I are all on the 
A&M faculty and had some idea of what the school

06:51.848 --> 07:12.979
would be like and all that sort

06:51.848 --> 07:12.979
of thing. In a place as old as Bryan, you get all 
kinds of actions to deal with, you know. The

07:20.857 --> 07:30.212
Mexicans and the Negroes and the whites all have a 
little different interest in the school. Out

07:30.232 --> 07:35.380
here, it is pretty much our school. Pretty much 
homogenous. I had read about, and I need some

07:38.685 --> 07:48.501
clarification if you know this incident, where 
the Bryan School District encouraged somebody to

07:50.168 --> 07:56.739
become the superintendent of a college station? 
Yeah. With the purpose of weakening?

08:04.211 --> 08:14.288
He admitted later that he was sent out here to take 
over or bring our school into Brian. Do you

08:15.610 --> 08:16.952
remember who that was? I can't think of his name. It 
was Bunning. His name was Bunning. Bunning?

08:23.685 --> 08:24.005
Bunning. And he later was county superintendent. 
Do you remember what years that was?

08:34.123 --> 08:35.526
Well, I was on the school board.

08:39.252 --> 08:42.518
We got off the campus in 1940.

08:55.087 --> 09:22.832
When

08:55.087 --> 09:22.832
I

08:55.087 --> 09:22.832
went on the school board,

08:55.087 --> 09:22.832
all the rest of the directors were Baptists.

09:25.175 --> 09:40.193
a fellow by the name of Breeland, Jim Breeland, 
went to Mississippi, I think,

09:25.175 --> 09:40.193
from here.

09:40.213 --> 09:47.522
They were, that group were pretty much in charge of 
the school at that time. And you can imagine the

09:47.542 --> 09:54.591
position I

09:47.542 --> 09:54.591
was in. vote as one man.

10:03.216 --> 10:07.025
And you had the dissenting vote most of the time. 
Dissenting vote, yeah. A little later.

10:25.823 --> 10:31.090
took control of the school, but it was pretty tough 
going for a while.

10:33.913 --> 10:37.578
Were their decisions arbitrary in any way? Oh, 
they just voted together.

10:43.846 --> 10:46.829
One would vote and then the rest of them would vote. 
The same way?

10:53.718 --> 10:56.642
Do you know what period that was, what time, what 
years?

11:03.553 --> 11:05.576
Well, I went on the school ward in 1944. Four

11:05.636 --> 11:21.801
or

11:05.636 --> 11:21.801
five years after that.

11:25.375 --> 11:26.777
I didn't have much to say. How many members made up 
the school board? How many people were on the

11:31.844 --> 11:38.254
school board?

11:38.274 --> 11:39.015
I think it was seven. Seven? I think

11:40.096 --> 11:45.544
it was five or seven.

11:50.519 --> 11:57.726
Did Mr. Bunting do any damage to the school system 
when he did?

12:01.709 --> 12:10.317
He

12:01.709 --> 12:10.317
made a statement. There was only one good boy in 40, 
so the school

12:21.805 --> 12:30.434
the boys in the school immediately organized us as 
the 40

12:21.805 --> 12:30.434
boys that he had in mind. And

12:30.474 --> 12:38.662
of course, he said what he wanted. He

12:38.723 --> 12:45.990
delighted in dissension and all that sort of 
thing. dissension within the school? Yeah. It was

12:50.451 --> 12:54.697
a pretty rough time. How long was he 
superintendent? About four years, I think.

13:00.286 --> 13:02.109
Something like that. Then he became county 
superintendent. But he wasn't able to... No. As

13:06.856 --> 13:14.408
soon as they got rid of him,

13:06.856 --> 13:14.408
the school fell into Who was the next 
superintendent after Bunting?

13:28.569 --> 13:42.792
Well, it came from out in Central Texas and was 
superintendent for about three or four years.

13:46.957 --> 13:55.531
down in the north edge of the Edwards Plateau near 
San Angelo.

13:58.135 --> 14:04.506
He was a very, very nice gentleman.

14:04.526 --> 14:11.597
Our school began to grow about that time.

14:12.404 --> 14:20.818
Didn't have somebody in the school system 
fighting to bring it into Bryan.

14:20.838 --> 14:29.051
Did Mr. Bunting make an active attempt to bring the 
school district into Bryan?

14:30.693 --> 14:32.056
We never knew what he was doing.

14:36.964 --> 14:39.087
We knew what he said. which indicated that is what 
he was working for. Do you remember the years that

14:46.718 --> 14:48.587
this happened?

15:11.315 --> 15:17.790
It

15:11.315 --> 15:17.790
was in the 40s, early 40s. Okay. I can't give you the 
exact year. That's fine. Just an approximate date

15:23.203 --> 15:25.408
is fine.

15:28.156 --> 15:31.260
Is there anything else you'd like to add about the 
school system? Basically, you're my best source

15:32.362 --> 15:50.706
as far as the school system is concerned that I 
haven't asked you about that might be important.

15:50.726 --> 15:54.771
A year or two ago, I could have helped you a great 
deal.

16:02.986 --> 16:06.391
What you've told me so far has been a lot of help. 
Well, I hope so.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.505
Your questions have helped me. Help you remember? 
Yeah, put your finger on things.

16:30.593 --> 16:49.559
If you don't remember anything anymore about

16:30.593 --> 16:49.559
the school, I'd like to talk about the lawsuit that 
was brought against the city concerning the

16:30.593 --> 16:49.559
legality of serving both the city and the state. Do 
you remember that? Yes.

16:55.387 --> 16:59.212
I served three years on the city council during 
that time. Mm-hmm.

17:05.474 --> 17:35.059
Mr. Anderson,

17:05.474 --> 17:35.059
not Frank Anderson, but DA Anderson,

17:05.474 --> 17:35.059
traveled all over the state

17:05.474 --> 17:35.059
and got

17:05.474 --> 17:35.059
that law,

17:05.474 --> 17:35.059
got them to do away with that law, which committed 
He attacked on the school system. It also attacked

17:41.822 --> 17:43.504
the school system? Oh, that's right. You couldn't 
serve on the school board. Yeah. And that's right.

17:49.953 --> 17:53.217
Do you remember who brought the suit against the 
city? Boyant, wasn't it? Yeah, Boyant. Why do you

17:58.525 --> 18:03.291
think he... Well, Boyant's...

18:06.275 --> 18:19.749
They owned a lot of land around here, and whenever

18:06.275 --> 18:19.749
the school had to buy more land, they had to buy it 
from the boys. Is that right, Alice? Yeah, and I

18:22.892 --> 18:35.505
don't know why, but they seemed to have got across 
roads with the city and the school, it seemed like.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.683
Well, they owned all that land north of the campus. 
They

18:40.265 --> 18:46.192
had problems with the taxes. With the tax? The 
taxes. Did they not want to pay? They were pretty

18:51.518 --> 18:55.483
bad about paying the taxes. I see. But you don't 
recall why he would bring it against the city, the

18:59.347 --> 19:04.193
suit?

19:10.265 --> 19:14.190
He was, when Mr. D.A. Anderson was mayor, he gave 
him an awful lot of trouble. And I can't remember

19:22.760 --> 19:24.462
why that was. But I know that he gave him a lot of 
trouble. I know they had a city meeting.

19:36.196 --> 19:37.057
Interesting people. Encouraged people to come.

19:44.032 --> 19:47.977
sort of counteract the Boyd effect. Was there 
someone of Boyd's on the city council around that

19:48.017 --> 19:54.966
time? There was one on the... I think there was. 
They kept them down on everything they wanted to

19:58.651 --> 20:01.795
do. Mr. Anderson was so interested in getting 
these lands for the parks at that time. He's the one

20:08.704 --> 20:10.647
that really pushed... ahead of time for us to have 
parkland around here. And they were kind of

20:15.286 --> 20:17.448
holding back on these things. I see. They weren't 
interested in... No, no, they just weren't

20:19.190 --> 20:23.034
aggressive. I don't think they could see that the 
city was going to grow that much. And they just

20:27.639 --> 20:30.922
didn't seem to see those things. I know he asked a 
group of us over there one Sunday, and I think he had

20:31.423 --> 20:39.992
other groups of interested citizens to talk to us 
about it. to see if we could get behind him on it

20:40.259 --> 20:47.853
because he was having such a hard time with these 
people. And then there was one man that really

20:47.873 --> 20:58.132
wasn't too well educated himself that was always 
on the council back then. I can't think of his name

20:58.152 --> 21:00.777
now. They had the districts different then.

21:10.330 --> 21:32.862
people that area for over there near where the city 
hall used to be over near the boy at land and and that

21:10.330 --> 21:32.862
man was always on there too and the boy had him under 
their finger you don't remember his name though i

21:10.330 --> 21:32.862
ought to be able to let her sit there okay

21:37.246 --> 21:39.448
whenever you think of it. If I do. Well, how did this 
lawsuit affect the city? How did it affect the

21:43.753 --> 21:47.758
government of the city? Well, it affected the 
government of all cities. And that's what Dee

21:53.304 --> 22:02.734
Anderson traveled all over the state to interest 
other cities in our problem. And they repealed it.

22:10.726 --> 22:18.637
your college within the city, because the greater 
number of people that would be interested in being

22:10.726 --> 22:18.637
on the council are employed by the state. And they 
could not hold a council position if they were

22:19.498 --> 22:31.374
employed by the state, even if they didn't pay the 
council, which they don't here at College

22:19.498 --> 22:31.374
Station. But you see, they

22:31.394 --> 22:37.442
supposedly couldn't collect the salary. But it 
even held true if you weren't getting a salary at

22:38.047 --> 22:43.013
the same. I know they had that same problem. Down 
there at Angleton, they have a son that's a lawyer

22:45.916 --> 22:49.860
down there, and he's a city lawyer. And they had two 
men that they had had on the city council. Maybe one

22:57.268 --> 22:58.710
of them was on the school board. I don't know. But 
they had been paid, I think, around $100 a month.

23:05.117 --> 23:07.800
And it caused a real problem because They said they 
had to pay back the money they collected. Isn't

23:11.627 --> 23:12.609
that awful? Is there a college in England? No, but 
these were school teachers. Oh, on the school

23:17.898 --> 23:18.880
board. Yeah, and they were school teachers, some 
of these people that were on the council. So they

23:24.409 --> 23:25.731
were serving Texas. So they were serving Texas. 
They were paid by Texas at these schools. And the

23:29.778 --> 23:30.780
council. Oh, I see. See, they were getting state 
money. So it would affect a lot of cities. Yes, and

23:36.816 --> 23:53.012
especially here back then in the times when Daddy 
was on there, they were all people from the

23:36.816 --> 23:53.012
university, and we didn't have many people out 
here that worked with the university. And so every

23:53.032 --> 24:00.400
one of the people on the council were, I guess every 
one of them was at that time, no, Don Dale, is he on

23:53.032 --> 24:00.400
there now? But most of them were employed by the 
university. My husband was 75 years old when they

24:06.017 --> 24:09.640
pushed him up. Oh, I didn't realize that. And Dr.

24:12.844 --> 24:21.413
Lindsey, he was 72. Both of them replaced two men 
that were employed by the university. And what's

24:27.139 --> 24:28.480
his name again? Fred Anderson. Fred Bryson. Is he 
still alive? No. No. No, he isn't alive. No, there

24:36.125 --> 24:41.956
are too many of those people that would have been 
good ones for you to talk to are gone now. That's too

24:41.976 --> 24:43.319
bad. This is our next-door neighbor. My husband 
was on the first city council. It would have been

24:48.157 --> 24:50.320
wonderful to talk to Mr. Gabbard. We've talked 
about him. Well, do you feel like the issue was

24:52.763 --> 24:55.627
valid at all? It was a state law, but they got it 
taken off. It was him? That's what D.A. Anderson

25:06.020 --> 25:08.883
traveled all over the state to. To get people to 
vote it off. Were these people... Oh, I see. Oh, it

25:13.587 --> 25:17.312
was in a constitutional amendment and people 
voted? Yes, they tried and then they had a chance to

25:17.332 --> 25:20.217
vote it off. And he encouraged... Well, that was 
wonderful. He really... He did it almost

25:23.502 --> 25:26.106
single-handed, I think. He traveled all over. 
He's done a lot of good things for the city. Do you

25:29.551 --> 25:31.194
know why he never... I know he had resigned during 
that period. Do you know why he never ran again for

25:33.477 --> 25:37.483
mayor after that? When he could? When he could. So, 
when you...

25:41.461 --> 25:55.658
Can you tell me about your becoming a councilman? 
It was something that you were asked to do, is that

25:55.678 --> 25:58.381
right? Andy Anderson asked him to run. And at that 
time, he wasn't getting off right away. And right

26:07.492 --> 26:08.413
after

26:15.852 --> 26:21.259
there to back him up with someone that knew about 
everything, Mr. Anderson. But he found he had to

26:22.160 --> 26:25.885
get off, too. So when these men were resigning from 
the council, Mr. Anderson asked you to run in a

26:25.905 --> 26:34.177
special election? Is that right? Yeah. And right 
after that, he had to resign then, too. Yes, I

26:41.346 --> 26:42.688
remember that. He did resign, yeah. He hadn't at 
the time.

26:48.134 --> 26:49.456
I don't remember why that was. Well, we know he 
resigned. Yeah, he resigned shortly after that.

26:53.081 --> 26:54.844
Really, before you were elected, though. Yeah. 
That was it. He did all he could before he had to get

26:55.926 --> 27:00.573
off. Except my husband so much that he had a mild 
stroke. Oh, is that right? Yeah, just...

27:05.020 --> 27:10.648
Yeah, it was in 71, wasn't it? Yes. Yes, it was. Then 
who became mayor after Mr. Anderson was signed?

27:19.641 --> 27:32.422
Oh,

27:19.641 --> 27:32.422
Dick Hervey. Yeah, Hervey. Dick Hervey. You know 
him, don't you? I don't know if he was connected

27:37.645 --> 27:40.769
with the bank. I don't know if he is anymore.

27:47.758 --> 27:50.742
How did the council meetings operate when you were 
on the council? How did they operate? What were

27:53.265 --> 27:54.106
they like?

27:58.631 --> 28:00.314
Did citizens attend? There were always some 
there.

28:12.830 --> 28:21.541
Were there...

28:12.830 --> 28:21.541
Breland was involved in the school, wasn't he? 
Yes, that was long before that time. That was when

28:26.368 --> 28:31.114
you were at school then. Yes, I was about 75 years 
old. Yeah, when you went on to college.

28:38.817 --> 28:49.851
Were there, was the council pretty much, how can I 
say this, harmonious or did you find that there was

28:38.817 --> 28:49.851
disagreement among the council on different 
issues? Well, I suppose there was some

28:51.894 --> 28:59.003
disagreement, but when I was on the council, it was 
pretty well in agreement. We were talking just a

29:00.535 --> 29:04.439
minute ago about the recreation program. Was this 
a time when the city devoted more of its energy into

29:05.541 --> 29:14.891
providing parks and things for the citizens?

29:21.038 --> 29:30.188
The council has been pretty generally favorable 
to the parks and that sort of thing. They really

29:31.855 --> 29:39.888
have done most of the developing of the parks since 
you were off of the council. In recent years,

29:39.908 --> 29:44.576
they've done so much of the developing of the 
parks. My daughter is on the council now. That's

29:47.060 --> 29:48.943
right. Would you say, though, that Anderson... 
He's the one that really... As far as I can

29:53.270 --> 29:59.316
remember, he really spearheaded the whole thing 
about the parks. He may have something different

29:59.916 --> 30:04.981
to tell you on that, but that's the way I see it. If it 
hadn't been for him, they might not have picked up

30:05.441 --> 30:10.766
land where they did back then. And that was the 
thing that he was working so hard at when the

30:11.046 --> 30:17.813
Boyettes were making it hard for him. So he could 
see the growth that College Station was? Yes. And

30:21.836 --> 30:22.517
then, of course, being in the kind of work that he 
was in, he knew the need for that sort of thing.

30:32.307 --> 30:45.462
Do you remember the

30:32.307 --> 30:45.462
Pinnell plan, a specific plan for growth of 
College Station during your period on the

30:32.307 --> 30:45.462
council? Wasn't that after you were on the 
Pinnell? It was after. I believe this is one of the

30:53.834 --> 31:02.011
first times they set down a specific plan for 
College Station. What did they call it, the 2000?

31:06.119 --> 31:06.981
The one now. Yeah. Yeah, that's the one now. I think 
this was called 701, Plan 701.

31:15.620 --> 31:17.785
That was after you were on the council. OK.

31:19.389 --> 31:27.267
Zoning has always been important in College 
Station. We had a zoning law since the city was

31:27.287 --> 31:30.314
incorporated. And do you remember why did the 
people want zoning? Well, they had people like Mr.

31:37.169 --> 31:41.135
Gabbard on there that knew the necessary things. 
Yeah, Mr. Gabbard and George Wilcox. It was a

31:44.881 --> 31:53.635
college-oriented group, and they had more vision 
than the ordinary person would have, things like

31:44.881 --> 31:53.635
that. And they had also seen... what had happened 
to Brian about something. Why don't you think

31:59.169 --> 32:01.311
Brian zoned? They never have. They weren't 
far-sighted enough to see ahead of time. And then

32:06.917 --> 32:13.505
you get into it, you know, and there's... Yeah, 
there are always people that are... It's against

32:13.525 --> 32:24.957
their interest because of certain real estate 
developments and that sort of thing. So they...

32:24.977 --> 32:26.599
Well, I guess you read the papers and followed 
their reasoning and so on. But Bryan had more of the

32:31.844 --> 32:38.731
real estate developer people in their town, 
whereas College Station... Not now. I think now we

32:38.931 --> 32:41.234
have about as many out here. But back then,

32:41.934 --> 32:50.663
really, Bryan was run by a few families almost, it 
seems like. You know, the old families. And they

32:53.146 --> 32:57.210
saw things one way and that was the way it was done. 
Do you know of any of the names of the families?

33:07.865 --> 33:08.405
I didn't know. So many of them are gone now, and 
things have changed in Bryant since it's got in the

33:10.208 --> 33:18.879
hands of more people now. More diversified type of 
people than they used to have.

33:26.992 --> 33:28.554
Everybody had to start out in Bryan. There wasn't 
anything out here except on the campus when we came

33:29.015 --> 33:33.061
here. And then some people had started a little 
development around what is Dexter Park now, or

33:33.182 --> 33:39.592
Bryson Park. And there were about 25 houses out 
there, and that's all of us here. And the few houses

33:43.938 --> 33:47.203
that were on the campus. Now the city has grown 
clear out to be. What's the name of that? The Texas

33:53.705 --> 33:55.589
Speedway? Well, not quite the Texas Speedway, 
but... Yeah, it's almost out there. Yeah, it's

33:59.537 --> 34:00.920
almost out there. The East Bypass. Yeah, see, 
that's the only way we can go over to the south and

34:02.322 --> 34:05.910
west. But you see, Brian looked at everybody 
connected with the university as trenches. That

34:14.006 --> 34:15.088
was the way to follow it.

34:20.924 --> 34:22.286
or anything like this. And one neighbor next door 
to me, who was very nice, she said, you know, they

34:22.726 --> 34:31.078
just think that way about the university people. 
Of course, it was college then. And she said, so she

34:32.660 --> 34:38.227
said, they can't be bothered with you. And that's 
the attitude they take. And so then they kind of

34:40.410 --> 34:47.640
would screen them out as far as letting them give 
any emphasis to anything that was going on in

34:40.410 --> 34:47.640
there. Why would they think college professors 
were transient since they usually stayed and

34:48.110 --> 34:54.678
worked at a university? Yeah, well, of course, 
some did just stay for a little while. But for some

34:58.964 --> 35:01.687
reason or other, they had that attitude. And of 
course, the housing was such a problem then. And

35:06.213 --> 35:09.898
people weren't building their own homes in there 
then. They were in red houses. And the housing

35:11.960 --> 35:17.307
situation was terrible when they came here. The 
first house we lived in out here, it's hard to tell

35:17.590 --> 35:29.702
the difference between the atmosphere in the 
house and outside the house. There just weren't

35:30.423 --> 35:34.027
any homes around the campus, right? No. Those were 
on the campus, owned by the state, and those were

35:34.527 --> 35:43.176
given preference.

35:43.561 --> 35:49.593
some heads and all heads didn't even get out of 
there, and deans and people like that. The Gabbers

35:50.255 --> 36:00.075
lived on the campus, the folks next door, and she 
was just saying the other day, she said, you know,

35:50.255 --> 36:00.075
that was such an undemocratic way of doing it. She 
said, here were the people that were on the lowest

36:00.095 --> 36:03.983
salaries having to struggle Of course, the rents 
were low everywhere then because salaries were

36:04.182 --> 36:10.488
low, like $30 a month and so forth. And that's all 
they were worth. And that's all they were worth.

36:14.131 --> 36:22.258
But she said, on the campus, she said she always 
understood that the deans didn't have to pay

36:14.131 --> 36:22.258
anything for their houses. And she said, we paid 
$21 for our house. And they were given months of

36:27.783 --> 36:34.189
privileges And two, the ones that were ranked a 
little higher up. That's interesting. It is,

36:41.227 --> 36:42.429
isn't it? So it was a good idea when they decided to 
get those off. You know, as things developed, it

36:46.614 --> 36:53.962
was just a very undemocratic way of doing it. Do you 
remember while you were on the council any big

36:53.982 --> 36:59.569
problems that the council had to deal with?

37:11.632 --> 37:15.858
I don't think we had any problems. The

37:15.879 --> 37:21.046
college station has them all now. Is that right? 
Well, it's developed so fast. 40,000 to 50,000

37:24.652 --> 37:30.581
people in the college station now. And 
apparently, from other than just around this

37:30.601 --> 37:40.356
area, they are recognized as having done a very 
good job. of handling this fast growth. Patsy said

37:43.380 --> 37:47.725
they didn't realize it until they got at some of 
these meetings. And they've been held up as kind of

37:47.745 --> 37:51.029
an example. That's wonderful. Handling rapid 
growth. But when Mr. Bonham was on the council, it

37:53.832 --> 37:58.237
was not growing as rapidly then? Oh, no. The thing 
that made it grow rapidly is one of the things, I

37:59.338 --> 38:06.006
should say, is when they brought the girls in here. 
No, that just made all the difference in the world.

38:09.466 --> 38:11.389
Everything developed. Isn't that funny? Every 
way. Eating places. Yeah. It's like someone was

38:18.961 --> 38:21.184
saying to me on the phone the other day. She said, 
you know, back before the last ten years or so, why,

38:21.585 --> 38:31.079
she said, if you had company, she said, you had to 
feed them at home. There was no taking them out. We

38:33.483 --> 38:34.204
didn't have it. in any of these places. Ten years? 
Well, maybe it's longer than that. Not much. Not

38:40.992 --> 38:43.054
much. Well, it's been longer than that. Ten years. 
Just amazing. Oh, it is. Every time you leave

38:51.702 --> 38:58.830
College Station and come back, you know, leave for 
six months or so and come back, it's all different.

38:59.230 --> 38:59.470
Yeah. Well, do you remember any great achievement 
or?

39:08.558 --> 39:10.400
We didn't think of them as that. No, we didn't 
think. Just take care of the regular things,

39:12.042 --> 39:15.827
regular business. And we didn't. And I remember we 
didn't have as much of the opposition of minor

39:21.213 --> 39:31.165
groups. No, that's true. The bigger this place 
gets, the more of that sort of thing. get people in

39:38.630 --> 39:40.712
here from all over. And this has been one of the 
biggest problems of late years is people have come

39:41.333 --> 39:50.442
in here from cities that have been in existence for 
100 years or more. And they can't understand why we

39:51.183 --> 40:01.813
don't have sidewalks everywhere and why we don't 
have this and don't have that in what's an

39:51.183 --> 40:01.813
organized city that's been there for 100 years. 
They can't seem to understand it. And so they kind

40:05.377 --> 40:08.400
of make little problems for them. Can you tell me 
about the character of the town in the early days?

40:14.090 --> 40:18.616
What people did for entertainment or recreation? 
Card parties. Yes, we had lots of parties. Big card

40:22.062 --> 40:22.723
parties. And big parties. And big parties. 
Afternoon, evening, both. I think those things

40:29.613 --> 40:38.927
changed with the war and with the place growing and 
other things that you could go to. But that pretty

40:39.515 --> 40:44.920
much made our own entertainment. I can remember 
the first card party we went to. I think it was at

40:49.365 --> 40:52.067
Leland's, wasn't it? Yeah, probably so. But there 
were

40:54.550 --> 41:00.376
nice groups here. Such congenial people, it 
seems. And everybody was interested in everybody

41:02.518 --> 41:04.800
else. You know, that was the only, really the 
only...

41:10.852 --> 41:13.114
recreation they had. It really was. Get together 
in parties, play cards, and have a good time. The

41:22.324 --> 41:31.974
people that you had the parties with still are in 
contact with, but on the whole, I guess the

41:22.324 --> 41:31.974
other... Most of them are dead. Oh, are they? 
There's so many of them, man. But

41:40.653 --> 41:51.570
would you say that the type of congeniality is not 
as prominent today? It is as prominent, but they

41:51.590 --> 41:55.776
have so many interests other than that. I see. 
There's so many things they can do. We have opus and

41:59.842 --> 42:01.364
all these things. They did have, for a good many 
years, they had what they called, was that town

42:01.685 --> 42:07.774
hall they called it then? and that that was always 
very nice they brought in you know entertainers

42:08.463 --> 42:36.883
and nearly everybody went to those and something 
like that but that was just kind of a seasonal thing

42:08.463 --> 42:36.883
but we uh and and we did so much of our shopping in 
houston oh really do you what could you say is uh an

42:08.463 --> 42:36.883
advantage of having the town that is influenced by 
college professors or college people? Well,

42:43.575 --> 42:58.700
I think the first thing is that you have a higher 
class of people to run the city.

43:01.224 --> 43:03.428
Well, and it makes such a difference in your 
school. We had realized that over the years, and

43:04.471 --> 43:13.039
that's what all these people, and they were across 
the street, had children in school, or wanted that

43:04.471 --> 43:13.039
in school. And so many of them like that will tell 
you that they had older children. Schools were

43:18.084 --> 43:20.527
different then than now. They didn't have all 
these drugs, you know, that sort of thing. And when

43:24.090 --> 43:30.597
our children were in high school, the whole school 
was just back here, under the back of us. And there

43:31.257 --> 43:34.140
were about 150 in high school. Well, you know, it 
was just one big family almost. And everybody knew

43:39.151 --> 43:41.334
everybody else. And if your children went out with 
someone, you knew who they were with. Now, they

43:46.379 --> 43:49.382
come in from everywhere, you see. And they tell me 
that it's quite different. They've been exposed

43:52.826 --> 43:55.189
to so many different things. A lot of people, as the 
city did develop earlier, There were people,

44:03.550 --> 44:08.396
traveling men, who covered a large area. Even when 
our children were in school, we began to get a few of

44:09.237 --> 44:16.486
those families moved in here because they saw what 
a nice community it was. And they decided that they

44:17.267 --> 44:21.031
could live anywhere in their area. And so they, 
just one family, I'm thinking of the girls in

44:21.452 --> 44:30.503
David's class, he said, he

44:37.705 --> 44:51.698
I

44:37.705 --> 44:51.698
believe this tape is going to run out let me check it
