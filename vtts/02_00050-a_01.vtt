WEBVTT

00:02.275 --> 00:05.199
This is the 22nd of February. Looks like perhaps it 
might rain outside. In the former student

00:10.406 --> 00:16.635
building, interviewing Ed Cooper, the second of 
what may be a number of interviews. Ed, try yours

00:17.175 --> 00:18.217
now. OK. Here I am in the library at the alumni 
office talking at a regular tone.

00:28.347 --> 00:41.344
We chatted with earlier about your student 
experiences Let's begin today when you came to

00:28.347 --> 00:41.344
College Station after serving in the extension 
service actually My first job, I was assistant

00:42.269 --> 00:47.277
county agricultural agent in Travis County, 
Austin, Texas. And that was just for a brief tour of

00:48.259 --> 00:54.569
duty to get a feel of what county agricultural 
agent work was all about. I had just returned from

00:54.910 --> 01:00.379
Germany as a lieutenant in the 2nd Armored 
Division, a tank platoon leader. And they put me in

01:01.388 --> 01:03.612
training in Austin. When Mr. Callender retired, I 
spent seven years as extension specialist in

01:03.632 --> 01:13.590
wildlife conservation and traveled all over the 
state. Some of my best memories of people in Texas

01:14.171 --> 01:19.660
occurred during those years. Then I left 
extension to get wealthy. That did not work. And I

01:24.625 --> 01:29.411
got a call from Clark C. Monroe, who was personnel 
director. That was the title. I wondered if I would

01:30.933 --> 01:36.060
interview as a prospect for President Rutter's 
assistant. Darcy McCrory had become director of

01:37.602 --> 01:43.229
development. That wasn't the title at the time, 
but that's what it was, fundraising. And I went in

01:48.616 --> 01:51.960
to Darcy. I'm getting ahead of myself. I went, I 
agreed to an interview. I was scared. I was afraid

02:01.153 --> 02:24.163
of Mr. Rutter as a lot of people were because here's 
an Army general and highly decorated veteran and I

02:01.153 --> 02:24.163
really didn't know what to expect and cold steel 
looking eyes and penetrating gaze and he looked me

02:01.153 --> 02:24.163
over and he says, Cooper, I understand that you 
sell limestone. I said, yes, sir, that's our

02:25.325 --> 02:27.329
business. And he said, would you make a good deal 
for me? I said, sure. Where do you want it? He said,

02:33.420 --> 02:36.967
well, it's between London and Hex, Texas. I said, 
you're talking about the hill country. I said, the

02:41.094 --> 02:42.757
whole thing is limestone. I don't think you really 
need it. And he just died laughing. And that's the

02:46.233 --> 02:49.316
way it started, and it got better from there. And I 
think with my military background and having come

02:50.157 --> 02:58.185
from the little town of San Marcos, things like 
that influenced him. I had been in the band and

02:58.205 --> 03:06.013
things like that, and I'd done some things that he 
paralleled with in some ways. What seemed to be his

03:06.774 --> 03:14.962
greatest concerns in that first conversation?

03:15.282 --> 03:16.003
We didn't... We didn't get into any substantial 
subject matter discussions at all, or as they

03:16.304 --> 03:27.683
would say these days, issues. There was no hint of 
that. I think his whole strategy, as he told me

03:32.231 --> 03:42.548
later, was to scope me out as an individual 
checking out my personal likes, dislikes,

03:43.034 --> 03:46.761
experiences, that kind of thing. I remember years 
later I was talking to him while I was on his staff

03:47.682 --> 04:02.429
about a faculty member that was really, can I use 
real language, really making an ass out of himself

03:47.682 --> 04:02.429
about two or three little things. And he just kept 
on. And I said,

04:11.553 --> 04:14.336
Why does the world have people like that? He said, 
well, when you hire someone, he said, no one is

04:15.998 --> 04:22.145
perfect. He said, find out very quickly what they 
do well at, keep them focused completely on that,

04:23.126 --> 04:34.960
and don't let them get out in the left or right field 
where they can't handle it. You can't expect them

04:35.841 --> 04:39.045
to do it if they're not inclined to do it, He said, so 
the secret to success and having people work for

04:39.481 --> 04:47.870
you is have them do what they're good at, and I don't 
really care what he says. He's a good professor.

04:50.773 --> 04:55.719
Now, you were not acquainted with him other than 
very casually before. That's right. I'd seen him

04:56.459 --> 04:59.463
at a distance.

05:02.146 --> 05:07.952
We hit it off, and a very short time later, I got back 
to Jacksonville, where I was living, In other

05:08.675 --> 05:10.597
words, I felt good about the interview. I felt he 
made me feel comfortable. He knew how to do that.

05:15.142 --> 05:27.417
And I think, to me, that's a trait of a great man, 
that they can find out what level you're at and they

05:15.142 --> 05:27.417
can adjust and bring themselves into that level so 
that good conversation takes place. But he wasn't

05:27.437 --> 05:36.387
scoping me out on anything like coeducation or 
integration or anything like that that came up

05:27.437 --> 05:36.387
while I was working for him. But I went to Dorsey 
McCrory as he left his office, and I said, Dorsey,

05:36.839 --> 05:48.266
tell me how to be a good assistant to the president. 
And he looked at me and smiled. He said, well,

05:51.654 --> 05:53.599
you'll find out. and said, I'll see you later, and 
he walked out. That was my total training for this

05:55.675 --> 05:59.539
job. Now, the selection, your being selected for 
this job occurred when? 1963. 63. 63. I was in that

06:10.210 --> 06:13.854
job four years. So we were right at the decision 
time for coeducation, voluntary core, and all

06:14.134 --> 06:20.280
that. That's right. Those things were already 
rumbling. And the things that, the big issues that

06:22.925 --> 06:37.761
came up in high school while I was in his office,

06:22.925 --> 06:37.761
to me the big issues were changing the name from 
Agricultural Mechanical College to Texas A&M

06:22.925 --> 06:37.761
University. The admission of black students. Of 
course, we'd had Hispanic for all time. That was

06:46.648 --> 06:47.929
never even an issue. The admission of female 
students and making the core non-compulsory.

07:00.022 --> 07:04.947
As much as, as close as he and I were,

07:08.892 --> 07:23.670
There are some things that I never did really 
understand about him, and the main one was how he

07:08.892 --> 07:23.670
really felt about the admission of women. I 
thought I could read him, and he would say

07:23.970 --> 07:34.102
something one time that would make me think, well, 
he's for this, and then he'd say something else. He

07:34.162 --> 07:38.207
would kind of sway with whoever he was talking 
with, about that subject. And of the four that I

07:40.320 --> 07:58.427
just mentioned, girls, blacks, name change, 
non-compulsory,

07:40.320 --> 07:58.427
of those four things, the women issue, the woman 
issue, was so far ahead of the others that they were

07:40.320 --> 07:58.427
just left in the dust. I recall reports, I've 
talked with Mrs. Rutter about this too, the papers

07:58.627 --> 08:06.439
reported that when There was a threat of girls 
coming to A&M. People were sending in diplomas by

08:10.248 --> 08:16.354
the suitcase full and senior rings and nasty 
letters. If they came in, Haskell, I didn't see

08:18.136 --> 08:21.760
them. I remember one torn-up diploma, and I 
remember one senior ring that was sent by. And I

08:28.407 --> 08:34.473
found out later that the man had gotten so big he 
couldn't wear the ring anymore anyway. But...

08:37.182 --> 08:44.752
there were three or four redneck Aggies, I call 
them, one in Beaumont, one in Dallas. And I'll not

08:45.954 --> 08:51.761
call names, but they stirred up a considerable 
amount of controversy. And it's like the crowd

08:53.043 --> 08:57.849
that said, give us Barnabas. That was something 
that a lot of people wanted to say but didn't have

08:59.211 --> 09:04.478
the courage to say. My mother, bless her heart, 
felt very strongly against coeducation. And I

09:12.585 --> 09:17.993
often wish that I could take her back across the 
campus and show her what has happened. She's gone.

09:19.936 --> 09:30.392
She lived to be 94, but she never was sold on that 
subject because she remembered A&M in the good old

09:19.936 --> 09:30.392
days when the boys wore gray and the girls weren't 
around to confuse us. One day in a conversation not

09:30.412 --> 09:33.717
recorded, You shared with me an idea that you, 
where you thought there was a person that Mr.

09:34.169 --> 09:45.442
Rutter had known a long time in politics that may 
have encouraged him. As far as the change goes?

09:48.325 --> 09:48.546
Yes. Yes. That little story is, and he told me that

09:49.487 --> 10:02.121
when he went to Washington, while after Mr. 
Johnson became president, which was what, 63?

10:02.602 --> 10:02.742
Mm-hmm. If he found out that Earl Rudder had been in 
town and spent some time without spending the

10:04.004 --> 10:21.473
night at the White House, he would get a nasty 
telephone call because they, well of course he was

10:04.004 --> 10:21.473
his West Texas campaign manager. It hurt his 
feelings when Mr. Rutter would go to town and not go

10:21.638 --> 10:25.285
by. And so one time he went and I believe it was the 
same trip where he had this conversation that is

10:25.926 --> 10:33.760
urgently important. I believe it was the same 
trip. An emergency came up that required Mr.

10:37.607 --> 10:41.875
Johnson's attention on end of the night. And 
President Rutter said, well, we're not going to

10:43.795 --> 10:50.242
get to have a drink and talk politics tonight. And I 
read in the paper where Fiddler on the Roof is

10:50.943 --> 10:57.289
showing at a theater near the White House. And so he 
got permission and left, took in the movie. And

11:01.013 --> 11:03.536
about 5 the next morning, the phone rang. And he 
said, goddammit, Rutter. He said, you're a guest

11:05.859 --> 11:13.667
of the President of the United States, and you 
won't even stay here and drink whiskey with him

11:05.859 --> 11:13.667
after work's over. And I think it was that trip or 
very close to it. And Mr. Rudder did not always tell

11:20.048 --> 11:22.892
me. He didn't have time or inclination. He didn't 
always tell me all of the personalities, all of the

11:27.500 --> 11:32.688
stuff that was going on. It's just impossible. So I 
was not privy to a lot of things that... because of

11:42.031 --> 11:46.877
the nature of the job that I had, a lot of big things 
that were going on. But on this particular thing,

11:46.897 --> 11:50.802
he said that he talked with President Johnson. He 
said, Lyndon, they're talking about

11:50.842 --> 12:03.077
integration,

11:50.842 --> 12:03.077
changing the name, making the core 
non-compulsory, and of all things, letting girls

11:50.842 --> 12:03.077
in our school. And the board would have to make that 
decision. He said, but I'd be right in the middle of

12:08.710 --> 12:11.414
it, of course. He said, what do you think? And he 
said, two of the things you're talking about, I

12:15.981 --> 12:23.312
don't think anyone in Washington cares about. But 
there are two things you're talking about that we

12:24.173 --> 12:27.057
do care about. one is equal opportunity for girls, 
one is equal opportunity for black people. He

12:33.118 --> 12:41.908
said, if you move into those right now, you can do it 
in your style and your way. If you don't, we'll do it

12:43.169 --> 12:44.791
for you. And I don't think you'll like the way we're 
going to do it. So with that message,

12:52.855 --> 13:06.889
He was able to come back and meet with some key 
alumni officials, former students, through the

12:52.855 --> 13:06.889
board and said, listen, fellas, here's the way it 
is. Now, if you want to fight that thing, tooth and

13:08.750 --> 13:14.916
toenail, we can do it, but we're going to be made 
laughing stock. The big man has said that the feds

13:16.118 --> 13:19.361
are going to do it for us. If we don't do it our way, 
could you get the word out to where the hell is being

13:23.939 --> 13:29.085
raised and let them know where we really stand. And 
suddenly things got quiet. And I remember, if I'm

13:33.370 --> 13:46.465
not mistaken, the Winter Council meeting is the 
one where a resolution had been drafted to support

13:33.370 --> 13:46.465
the board in these moves. And I can't remember 
whether it was all in the same document or not. I'm

13:49.989 --> 13:51.130
not sure about that. My memory's not that good. But 
the main one, of course, was girls. And if I'm not

13:57.012 --> 14:00.957
mistaken, John Lindsay was president that year. 
And if my memory is correct, the board of

14:01.638 --> 14:14.533
directors, as we then call the regents, and the 
association board met the same day. And there was a

14:16.495 --> 14:20.440
quick approval, and they went down the hallway 
quickly. Yeah, they were in the same building.

14:22.244 --> 14:22.705
Right. They were in the, the council meeting was in 
the, what we call the assembly room or something

14:22.725 --> 14:28.130
else now. But I remember I was in the room and the 
resolution was raised and John Lindsay was about

14:28.971 --> 14:43.165
the color of your shirt, afraid of a bomb, you know, 
blowing up there at the meeting. And I think there

14:44.666 --> 14:49.431
had been discussions about who would make the 
motion. and who would second it and it happened

14:50.761 --> 15:17.494
like a shot in the dark and the gavel was slammed and 
he said motion approved and uh and he he got off that

14:50.761 --> 15:17.494
that hot stool probably the hottest one he's ever 
been on and and from then on really uh it was a

14:50.761 --> 15:17.494
foregone conclusion and then you'll remember of 
course all of the how the legislature got involved

14:50.761 --> 15:17.494
in it And that was a very unpleasant kind of a thing. 
And there was all sorts of attempts to sway people

15:20.732 --> 15:27.721
one way or the other. And they had an open forum on 
the subject on the floor of the house. And people

15:32.507 --> 15:36.432
made impassioned speeches. And it was not well 
handled. And I don't remember all the specifics of

15:39.696 --> 15:42.319
who did what. I do remember that... There was even a 
little hanky-panky involved, trade-offs, and

15:45.993 --> 15:52.585
I'll not mention who that involved. Now, our local 
legislators were strongly in favor of the

15:53.768 --> 15:58.597
changes. Yes, yes. And that would have been 
Senator Bill Moore. Right. Was it David Haynes?

16:06.791 --> 16:07.652
No, no. Presnell? No, before him. Before Haynes 
even? Yeah, a quiet guy. Oh, was it Brownrig Dewey?

16:14.939 --> 16:16.021
Brownrig Dewey. Yeah, later came in and was 
Justice of the Peaks. That's right. Yeah,

16:20.525 --> 16:22.467
Brownrig Dewey, that's right. He preceded 
Haynes, and then Haynes was...

16:29.868 --> 16:56.719
personal came in after Hank on the board of 
directors then as far as you can recall who were the

16:29.868 --> 16:56.719
key first broad question who were the most 
powerful most potent members of the board of

16:29.868 --> 16:56.719
directors at that time Sterling Evans and of 
course things that you and I cherished here, he was

16:57.290 --> 17:01.076
largely responsible for above and beyond that. 
But he honestly felt deep in his heart about

17:01.737 --> 17:09.669
coeducation. All right, let me offer his answer. I 
asked him, when did he favor coeducation? And he

17:16.019 --> 17:17.401
said, what do you mean? I said, when did you start 
believing that girls ought to be at A&M? And he

17:22.489 --> 17:25.373
grinned and said, when I got here as a 17-year-old 
boy. And there weren't any. He said, I have always

17:27.163 --> 17:29.828
been for coeducation. Sterling Evans, to me, I

17:29.848 --> 17:38.484
saw great people on that board of directors back 
there.

17:42.192 --> 17:42.973
Dr. Boyle. from Dow Chemical in his precise German 
ways would bring the first handheld computers

17:43.966 --> 17:52.158
I've ever seen. And they'd be up talking about 
construction costs and financing and interest

17:53.000 --> 17:58.909
rates and all. And he'd say, you're off a little bit 
on that, aren't you? And he was checking them out as

18:03.415 --> 18:05.378
they spoke. And the man that was president of 
Tennessee Gas Not Cain. No. Not Orford Cain. Oh,

18:17.731 --> 18:22.657
it'll come to me before we're through. But there 
were some sure enough good people on there. Of

18:25.921 --> 18:28.124
course, Clyde Wills had been on there forever. All 
right. Al Davies and Dick Goodson come along

18:29.566 --> 18:34.372
somewhere about that time. That's right. Sears 
and Southwestern Bell. Right. And the man with

18:38.377 --> 18:41.260
Hart Hanks, the... Man from Amarillo, Amarillo 
Globe News. Those names now are getting fuzzy with

18:48.166 --> 18:50.108
me. We can identify those. But

18:52.831 --> 18:57.136
L.F. Peterson was in there. As far as my memory, the 
man from

18:57.176 --> 19:11.331
Boydle and Evans and the guy with Tennessee Gas, 
good gracious. They were really super players,

19:12.442 --> 19:18.613
and they didn't have axes to grind. They wanted to 
do what was right. And

19:23.101 --> 19:35.985
when they would come to town, and there'd be these 
little sessions before the board meeting, the

19:23.101 --> 19:35.985
directors would say to President Rutter, What do 
you want us to do for you at this meeting? And since

19:43.473 --> 19:46.759
then, it has not always been that way. Now you're 
inferring that they gave evidence that they

19:47.099 --> 19:55.493
thought their task was to help the institution. 
not to micromanage it. That's correct. As far as

19:59.855 --> 20:11.963
you're aware, with those big issues, those four 
big issues, who was the most outspoken opponent on

19:59.855 --> 20:11.963
the board, if there was one?

20:15.976 --> 20:22.406
The guy from, this is not in response to that 
question, but Sam Wittenberg was the man from

20:15.976 --> 20:22.406
Amarillo. He was, I mean, he was top notch. He 
didn't attend all the meetings, but he was here.

20:29.476 --> 20:34.744
But I was not aware of an individual on the board 
that was vociferous about those issues. If there

20:39.980 --> 20:41.942
were, I don't know who it would be. I don't remember 
any newspaper discussion of there being a divided

20:41.962 --> 20:47.249
vote. It seemed to me as an outsider that whatever 
differences of opinion there were, they resolved

20:48.350 --> 20:56.260
them. and gave publicly the appearance of 
unanimity. That's correct. And of course things

21:01.745 --> 21:07.470
go on in chambers that you and I would never have 
access to and no one would ever talk about. So it may

21:07.550 --> 21:14.756
have been a rougher road to hoe than I know about, 
but I think I would have heard something about it.

21:15.136 --> 21:17.138
And we didn't have open meetings law then. No, we 
did not. In my interview with Vice President Wayne

21:19.480 --> 21:25.605
Hull, then the Chief Academic Officer, he 
indicated that he is the one who thought up the name

21:26.176 --> 21:37.893
as it now is with the A&M with no periods, no 
abbreviations. He said that it was his

21:38.494 --> 21:55.339
recollection that Mr. Rutter was very much 
bothered by the proposed name of Texas State

21:38.494 --> 21:55.339
University and that he wanted the A&M and that he, 
Hall, came up with that and Mr. Rutter liked that. I

21:56.382 --> 21:58.505
don't remember that particular thing. But I do 
remember his resentment of Texas State

21:59.686 --> 22:07.075
University. He did not like that. He was enough. I 
think his idea at Haskell was that we're taking

22:10.239 --> 22:18.950
away some things from some people that really are 
near and dear to us. Let's don't take it all. Let's

22:21.533 --> 22:23.976
leave the symbolic part. name of the place at least 
and so uh but this is what he was good at and of course

22:24.580 --> 22:54.283
that's what lyndon johnson was good at he would uh 
he knew how to compromise now uh once in a

22:24.580 --> 22:54.283
conversation with mr rutter early in 19 calendar 
1970 i said to him mr rudder only you could have done

22:24.580 --> 22:54.283
that although made those changes he grinned and he 
said why do you say that and i then kind of made a list

22:54.567 --> 23:06.486
Verbally, I said, sir, they couldn't say you 
weren't a Texan, you weren't an Aggie, you hadn't

22:54.567 --> 23:06.486
been in the Corps, you hadn't served your country, 
that you're one of those fuddy-duddy PhDs from

22:54.567 --> 23:06.486
somewhere way off in the Northeast. And he smiled 
and he said, oh, I never thought of any of that. His

23:11.113 --> 23:13.637
smile gave me the impression that he had a great 
deal. What I'm leading to is a question. Did his

23:18.564 --> 23:20.828
background...

23:23.052 --> 23:33.326
of being a Texan and an Aggie, do you recall that 
that was very positive in his being able to make

23:23.052 --> 23:33.326
those changes occur? Yes.

23:36.671 --> 23:42.139
Well, of course,

23:36.671 --> 23:42.139
he's a hill country boy.

23:45.043 --> 23:46.685
He worked hard all his life. He was from humble 
beginnings. He got into the land commissioner's

23:49.563 --> 23:53.487
job by being close to. He had attributes across the 
board that were positive in his background and his

23:53.527 --> 24:03.598
experience. And, of course, his war record just 
enhanced all of that. But I can't think of anything

24:06.661 --> 24:10.505
that would have been negative. If you say to 
someone from Texas,

24:11.426 --> 24:17.612
wherever you are, geographically

24:19.128 --> 24:44.224
you say well he's he's an old hill country boy they 
know what you're talking about and there's some

24:19.128 --> 24:44.224
kind of a positive connotation with that maybe 
it's because it's the heart of Texas or it is a part

24:19.128 --> 24:44.224
of Texas that everybody loves but there's kind of a 
feeling that if he grew up there some of the

24:19.128 --> 24:44.224
goodness of it had to rub off on him All right, let's 
mention some of the other relationships. What was

24:47.998 --> 24:51.061
his relationship with our congressman at that 
time?

24:56.708 --> 24:57.629
The congressman?

25:01.113 --> 25:03.536
I asked my Sunday school class the other day. We 
were talking about Timothy and his role going to

25:06.059 --> 25:13.688
Philippi at Paul's request to satisfy some 
problems at the church. The man had humility and

25:19.269 --> 25:26.578
the deepest faith that anyone could imagine, and 
that's why Paul sent him out. While he was in jail,

25:26.939 --> 25:28.981
he was most of the time. But I asked this class the 
other day, I said, now name me a person right now,

25:29.923 --> 25:39.996
either in Austin or Washington, that you would 
describe as one of great humility and anxiety to

25:40.229 --> 26:06.878
serve with no selfish motive who is that person and 
I said I knew such a person and I would have called

25:40.229 --> 26:06.878
his name if you would have asked me that it was 
Olenny Teague I said he would comb his hair ten

25:40.229 --> 26:06.878
years after the war and pieces of shrapnel would 
come out with a comb and he would come up to me and

26:07.499 --> 26:29.243
after not having seen me for a while and kind of 
waddled up and put his hand out way before he got to

26:07.499 --> 26:29.243
me and his words were always the same, Edwin Cooper 
or Ed Cooper, what can I do for you today and how is

26:07.499 --> 26:29.243
Peggy and all those kids.

26:29.263 --> 26:35.430
I see Congressman Teague and Mr. Rutter as being in 
many ways peas out of the same pod they had the same

26:35.782 --> 27:04.168
strong conviction about America and about Texas 
and about doing things right and I think they

26:35.782 --> 27:04.168
honestly both had the spirit of what I think is one 
of the best logos of any civic club in the world

26:35.782 --> 27:04.168
namely Rotary when an issue comes up and a decision 
has to be made What is it that will do the most good

27:05.853 --> 27:12.000
for the most people for the longest period of time? 
Now, how can you improve on that? And I really

27:13.982 --> 27:16.344
believe that both those men felt that way. They 
loved to tease each other. Tiger

27:18.326 --> 27:27.977
loved to tell a story about the cow that wouldn't 
give enough milk, and Mr. Rudder would water it

27:27.997 --> 27:33.042
down, and he'd counterattack with his high-level 
jaw about it. Sheep barn shoveling manure and

27:33.578 --> 27:37.123
stuff like that. But they truly and honestly 
admired and respected each other. They were

27:41.910 --> 27:46.097
playing off the same page. I remember one day Mr. 
Rudder came up to me and said, Listen, Tiger's

27:49.782 --> 27:53.187
coming in. He's going to be over in the lobby of the 
MSC at 1.30. Then he expects me to be there.

28:00.498 --> 28:01.179
Something's come up. I cannot be there. And he 
handed me a roll of $50 bills, I think. I believe

28:08.621 --> 28:09.782
there were eight of them. And he said, when you 
shake hands with Tiger, have that palm in your hand

28:11.304 --> 28:18.250
and don't tell him who it came from. He said, the man 
that gave it to me doesn't want him to know. And I

28:24.336 --> 28:25.637
shook hands with Tiger. And of course, he felt the 
money. He looked down. He didn't say a word. He just

28:28.059 --> 28:29.841
kept on talking. But there was that. 
well-understood interchange of things

28:33.029 --> 28:38.235
political that happened between two people like 
that. That's what makes the world go round. But

28:41.019 --> 28:45.184
they were very much alike in their temperament. 
Olin E. Teague never came to College Station

28:45.765 --> 28:52.714
without telling President Rutter when he'd be 
here and when they could get together. And they

28:53.334 --> 28:54.856
would set up late hours. They'd have a drink or two 
and talk about what it was in Washington, what it

28:56.118 --> 29:02.766
was in College Station that were issues of the day. 
And then the then comparatively young new

29:03.573 --> 29:15.323
governor and his wife, I understand, had been 
classmates of Mrs. Rutter at the University of

29:03.573 --> 29:15.323
Texas.

29:17.946 --> 29:21.429
What was the relationship of President Rutter 
with Governor Conley?

29:26.053 --> 29:32.719
Their roots went back a

29:26.053 --> 29:32.719
good ways. And it was first name basis. I remember 
the governor was here after having been shot in the

29:39.173 --> 29:50.227
parade at Dallas, not too long afterwards. And we 
had, we met, we, Mr. Rudder and Mr. the vice

30:00.965 --> 30:29.740
presidents and all, they formed an honor guard 
with the RVs with the swords at that west entry down

30:00.965 --> 30:29.740
to where the board quarters are now of the MSC and 
the boys gave, present arms and raised their

30:00.965 --> 30:29.740
swords and here we were at one end waiting for them 
to come through and Connolly flinched as if he was

30:00.965 --> 30:29.740
scared when the swords were drawn, and he was 
teasing. He just did like that, you know. And when

30:36.623 --> 30:41.729
he got to Mr. Rutter, he held his arm out, and he 
said, Earl, don't twist my arm. It still hurts. And

30:44.312 --> 30:49.359
then they went into one of those rooms that was 
reserved for regents, I think. That's before they

30:49.399 --> 30:51.902
had their own quarters. And they talked for hours 
in there. And he was here to, it might have been a

30:54.265 --> 30:59.271
commencement speech, but...

31:02.238 --> 31:06.257
When you consider the political arena of
