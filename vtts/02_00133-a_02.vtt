WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:19.812
Okay, as we look at how the college has come through the years, as well as the university, there's a lot of little incidences that probably, we could talk about a few of them, but you remember the time that they

00:20.450 --> 00:33.595
the students found nitroglycerin in the chemistry department and they worked out in the field setting this off and then they decided that they'd set it off after the students had come back from we've never been licked.

00:34.116 --> 00:42.492
So they got back in their dorm rooms and just beginning to settle down, it's about midnight, and they set off those charges over there in the core area

00:42.472 --> 00:44.915
And they thought they were being attacked.

00:45.515 --> 00:50.882
And it knocked out some windows, glasses, and it went out on the national news the next day.

00:51.002 --> 00:55.387
A&M's, the ROT buildings have been bombed.

00:56.288 --> 00:57.729
Of course, it wasn't at all.

00:57.749 --> 00:59.511
It was just a prank on the part of those students.

00:59.532 --> 01:04.337
But one of our children had been into a band thing.

01:04.357 --> 01:05.458
And they came back that night.

01:05.478 --> 01:06.179
And it was real late.

01:06.199 --> 01:06.960
They'd been to Dallas.

01:07.430 --> 01:12.096
And we heard that go off and it sounded like a sonic boom, you know.

01:12.116 --> 01:23.792
But that was a, I remember they fined those guys and it seemed like they cost three of them about $2,900 each or something like that to replace the windows and damage they'd done to those trees.

01:23.912 --> 01:27.557
Bob Rucker got in on those trees, you know.

01:27.577 --> 01:32.323
And there'd been others like, I probably told you that story about

01:33.940 --> 01:41.411
A student in my class, he pulled an all-nighter and tried to make a good grade and he made a 47.

01:41.591 --> 01:55.611
And he went home and he called, went to his dorm room, he was in a corps, and went to his dorm room and he called his mother and she happened to be out in the field working and she didn't get his message but he wanted to come home.

01:56.148 --> 02:05.402
But anyway, we'd talk to him and told him that he could still make it at A&M and encouraged him to stay here and develop better habits.

02:05.542 --> 02:11.071
And if he would do well from then on, we'd make some adjustment for that.

02:11.151 --> 02:12.954
Well, he ended up making an A in my class.

02:13.595 --> 02:15.878
He stayed here at A&M.

02:15.858 --> 02:35.132
and became deputy corps commander, and he won the Earl Rudder, you know, the Brown Earl Rudder Award as outstanding graduate that year, and then went on to law school, and then came back later, and he was a systems attorney for Texas A&M when they were requiring the right-of-way to build the road from the airport to the annex.

02:35.112 --> 02:39.677
And he was the system's attorney legal officer in charge of that.

02:40.137 --> 02:49.627
And when they had completed the highway construction, then they came, as the story is reported, and I don't know whether it's all facts or not, but it's reported to me that it is.

02:49.727 --> 02:56.995
And if I asked the former student, he could probably tell me for sure, because that's how it came to me that he was telling this story.

02:57.015 --> 03:00.659
When they asked, do you have any suggestions as to what we named this highway?

03:01.159 --> 03:04.022
And he said, call it 47.

03:05.403 --> 03:07.387
So they named it Texas 47.

03:07.548 --> 03:16.807
And so I guess famous grades may not be a famous number, but it became something that will be here a long time.

03:16.827 --> 03:21.757
And I can sure relate to that, and I sure old Bill will too, you know.

03:21.918 --> 03:24.002
I thought that was good, and he was in the Corps.

03:23.982 --> 03:25.164
And Squadron 6.

03:27.186 --> 03:35.057
By the way, that's Rick Perry's old outfit, and that's John Sharp's old outfit, and Dr. Joe Townsend's old outfit.

03:35.098 --> 03:37.741
So we had a lot of famous people come out of that outfit.

03:37.761 --> 03:38.743
It doesn't exist anymore.

03:38.763 --> 03:41.907
It was combined in another, and they combined in another, and so on and so forth.

03:42.865 --> 03:55.560
There was another little incident over in biology I thought was sort of funny in a way, but they had a, you probably remember, they had a skeleton over there of a woman and they named her Maisie.

03:56.421 --> 03:57.121
That was her name.

03:58.503 --> 04:05.971
And this guy in charge of this anatomy class, he bragged about how many years they'd had Maisie there and nobody had ever taken Maisie.

04:06.312 --> 04:09.115
So he was just setting it up for some students to do that.

04:09.836 --> 04:12.619
And so one day he came in and Maisie was missing.

04:13.139 --> 04:18.087
And so the word went out all over, and they were looking for that skeleton.

04:18.248 --> 04:19.169
They couldn't find it.

04:19.209 --> 04:22.856
They knew it had been used as a prank or something, but they never could find it.

04:23.577 --> 04:27.283
So the College of Science wondered, how are we gonna ever get that back?

04:27.323 --> 04:32.372
And that professor was embarrassed, you know, because these students had played that trick on him.

04:33.434 --> 04:34.776
Well, one day,

04:35.093 --> 04:43.401
I got this anonymous call and said we have something in a container we'd like for you to help us get it back to where it belongs.

04:44.042 --> 04:51.069
But say we will not identify ourselves or we don't want to get in trouble but we feel like this ought to be restored.

04:51.689 --> 05:00.458
So I talked to one of the deans of science over there and said that I could help them locate that and would they honor that request.

05:00.478 --> 05:01.759
They say certainly because

05:01.739 --> 05:07.886
We know it was just a prank, and if we get that back, that's all we want, and it'll be forgotten forever.

05:08.507 --> 05:15.915
And so that all happened, and as far as I know, nobody ever knew how that happened or where it came about.

05:17.036 --> 05:19.900
And the professor just walked back into where it was supposed to be.

05:20.380 --> 05:20.821
There it is.

05:20.841 --> 05:21.461
Where did it come from?

05:21.582 --> 05:22.483
And nobody ever knew.

05:23.344 --> 05:25.806
Did you speak to some students?

05:25.826 --> 05:26.447
Oh, yes.

05:27.423 --> 05:31.309
They learned a lesson, but at the same time, we kept it all confidential.

05:33.112 --> 05:37.800
Now, were you just guessing as to which students might be the guilty parties?

05:37.820 --> 05:39.122
No, they had to confess.

05:39.883 --> 05:40.223
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

05:40.243 --> 05:45.412
They had to confess, but they trusted me, and I trusted them.

05:45.432 --> 05:51.321
And nobody to this day knows who they were except the student themselves.

05:51.638 --> 05:55.086
And in fact, no harm was done.

05:55.106 --> 05:55.707
Oh, not at all.

05:55.847 --> 05:56.449
To any.

05:56.469 --> 05:57.912
No, no.

05:57.932 --> 06:03.945
But a professor just should not challenge an Aggie.

06:04.105 --> 06:08.074
Did you ever have any good bull tried in your class or your lab?

06:10.279 --> 06:10.339
No.

06:10.319 --> 06:39.786
in a way you know I did some things to students like if somebody was fall asleep you do some real silly things like I sort of say to the class you know and let them get quiet and I point over here this guy's asleep and I'd say okay now let's do this simultaneously hit our hands together of course we would and that guy just jumped straight up you know I'd say what in the world happened you know oh we've done things like that just keep people going and

06:39.766 --> 06:41.609
We're always doing things like that.

06:42.210 --> 06:43.832
Sometimes you'll have a speaker come in.

06:43.892 --> 06:49.781
I remember having a speaker come in one time on a topic, says, you're not supposed to be teaching this class.

06:49.861 --> 06:52.545
I'm supposed to be teaching this class, and got the students.

06:52.565 --> 06:59.636
They started running out of the front of the room, you know, but it was all just to wake them up, make sure that they were excited about being at A&M.

06:59.656 --> 07:08.710
We finally calmed them down, you know, but little instances like that, which to me, it's disruptive, but at the same time, it...

07:08.892 --> 07:12.317
It keeps them alert, and they don't forget it then.

07:12.417 --> 07:15.462
I mean, then you can go, they're ready to learn, and you can teach them.

07:15.642 --> 07:31.305
Now, down through the years, for undergraduate lecture class, what were your guidelines for the students about their classroom demeanor and appearance and attendance?

07:31.285 --> 07:38.001
Well, I certainly want them to be there, and I want them to be alert, and I want them to be respectful to other students.

07:38.622 --> 07:43.073
Now, what they wear, as long as it's not embarrassing, it's okay.

07:43.474 --> 07:49.007
I mean, I don't make them shape up like a Corps cadet member.

07:49.662 --> 07:51.726
Some people do, but I never have done that.

07:51.746 --> 08:01.928
I've seen people have tried to do that, but where they'd have a cap on, and the professor would say, Mr. such-and-such, would you remove your cap?

08:01.948 --> 08:07.620
And finally, the professor acts pretty rude to him, and the student will retort back,

08:08.208 --> 08:11.472
If you want my cap off, you come and remove it.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.194
And of course, that's a challenge to the professor.

08:13.214 --> 08:20.122
And I would advise young professors, don't put yourself in a confrontation like that because it's embarrassing to everybody.

08:20.362 --> 08:24.627
And sometimes professors will lock the doors on students that show up late.

08:25.087 --> 08:26.889
Well, I don't do that either.

08:27.450 --> 08:33.777
But I do want them to show respect to the class and to the professor and to their other students.

08:33.757 --> 08:37.201
Do you have any rules about regular attendance?

08:37.221 --> 08:38.603
What if they're absent regularly?

08:39.264 --> 08:48.155
I want them to be there, and if they're there all the time, they will get extra credit, and they will get extra privileges.

08:48.816 --> 08:58.768
And I call sometimes my golden pinata, you know, and they don't know what's going to be in that, but they've learned to be there, because that's many times...

08:59.592 --> 09:07.830
being there as part of the grade and it counts and I just feel like that that's the way you ought to show up because if you get out in the business world

09:08.418 --> 09:09.419
You ought to show up.

09:09.740 --> 09:12.223
If you're going to work for somebody, you ought to show up and produce.

09:12.423 --> 09:14.566
And that's what I expect them to come to class and be ready.

09:14.626 --> 09:18.230
And you have more than 30 years here now.

09:19.072 --> 09:25.139
When you started, what were the important, what was the most important course or courses you were teaching?

09:25.820 --> 09:31.287
Well, at the time, I was teaching the graduate courses and then the

09:31.267 --> 09:34.832
but primarily the graduate courses.

09:34.933 --> 09:45.509
But in recent years, I've taught the introductory course, which last time I taught it, which was last year, we had 830 students, I think, during the year.

09:46.470 --> 09:50.997
And now I'm teaching in land economics

09:51.398 --> 09:55.323
real property valuations, which deals with our land resources.

09:55.764 --> 10:15.010
But I've taught marketing courses, I've taught resource valuation courses at the graduate level, and I've taught the research methodology, production economics, and several other courses like econometrics and so on and so forth.

10:14.990 --> 10:25.230
How has the teaching of those courses, how has the content emphasis in those courses changed in these three decades?

10:25.250 --> 10:30.420
Well, the principles are, as far as the laws and the principles, are much the same.

10:30.781 --> 10:32.965
The technology is different.

10:32.945 --> 10:46.681
some of the sophistication in model building and with now that we can use the personal computers used to, you know, a computer the size you can have on your desk used to take up this whole room, you know.

10:47.221 --> 10:51.306
So it allows us to do things with technology we can never do before.

10:51.726 --> 10:59.475
Like we can model situations and we don't have to carry around a bunch of cards and you can run a simulated model and

10:59.455 --> 11:01.597
and illustrate the principles real fast.

11:01.637 --> 11:15.890
And students can have it interactive on the computer, like if they don't like your lecture or if they didn't understand it, they can go into the laboratory and click on and see the same things and then interact with it, plugging in numbers and things like that.

11:15.910 --> 11:18.532
That's the big difference today than what it used to be.

11:18.933 --> 11:26.459
And, of course, there have been some new topics added, like the environmental issues now and some of the legal issues that affect economics are there.

11:27.180 --> 11:29.462
And those are the main changes.

11:29.442 --> 11:40.043
If you were guessing what will be the changes in the next decade or so, what other points of emphases may we be adding?

11:40.744 --> 11:45.173
I think definitely we have to look more carefully at the environmental issues.

11:45.659 --> 11:50.606
as what we do, how does it impact those around us and the resources.

11:51.186 --> 12:02.501
I think we're gonna have to be more concerned about how things integrate together, what we call a synergism, and also how that different dynamic groups work together.

12:03.102 --> 12:08.950
And there's a big debate over public and private rights and over

12:09.723 --> 12:23.207
how these shared relationships between public and private entities go about, say like economic development or developing land resources and working with people and institutions.

12:23.367 --> 12:28.035
Institutions are gonna be a big thing and I think of institutions as

12:28.876 --> 12:50.496
like how does this go about doing its thing like what are the rules what are the objectives and what are the outcomes and how do we go in and assess these so in a way uh institution has a rules of a going concern like Texas A&M has a set of rules so they're a going concern so they'd be an institution see compare the

12:50.982 --> 12:57.130
the preparation, the capability of the students 30 years ago, a third of a century ago and now?

12:57.951 --> 12:58.371
Okay.

12:58.772 --> 13:06.841
As far as their scores on standardized test scores, they are higher now.

13:08.063 --> 13:11.147
As far as their intellect, there's probably not really any difference.

13:12.488 --> 13:20.398
In terms of sophistication with techniques, they are better at that.

13:20.378 --> 13:26.688
As far as understanding individuals and society, they're not any advanced over that.

13:26.728 --> 13:36.063
They know more about what's out there and they ought to with all the information available on the media and everything.

13:37.064 --> 13:38.286
But I think the

13:39.397 --> 13:43.346
They don't have any more maturity, in my opinion, than they had 30 years ago.

13:43.928 --> 13:48.178
They still come with those same awkward decisions they have to make.

13:49.120 --> 13:56.899
And even though they have more information and they're bombarded with it, they probably have to face issues earlier in their life.

13:57.352 --> 14:02.520
I look at Aggies today, they're just a different group.

14:02.601 --> 14:07.829
I look out at them, they got the same faces in terms of they're 18, 19, 20 year old.

14:08.130 --> 14:09.352
They haven't changed a lot.

14:09.832 --> 14:12.096
They still have those basic solid values.

14:13.438 --> 14:17.786
They're a little more restless, you know, and they like Noah's a little more.

14:18.366 --> 14:23.595
So you have to use more pizazz in the classroom, I think, things like that to get their attention.

14:24.048 --> 14:27.975
You can't go up there and use a chalkboard and just lecture.

14:28.475 --> 14:33.123
Some people do, but maybe half the class absent, you know.

14:33.143 --> 14:34.465
You have to entertain them.

14:34.525 --> 14:37.831
That's probably the, involve them and entertain them.

14:37.891 --> 14:39.554
Get them involved, you know.

14:39.934 --> 14:48.168
Now, in geographic background, is there any difference today of ag majors a third of a century ago?

14:48.689 --> 14:49.971
Are they more urban?

14:50.525 --> 14:51.947
Yes, a lot more urban.

14:51.967 --> 14:52.468
That's right.

14:53.069 --> 14:54.652
A lot more urban than they were.

14:55.674 --> 15:05.129
And the students, though, are, and they're not familiar with a lot of the rural problems and things like that.

15:05.169 --> 15:07.453
They just don't know about them.

15:08.176 --> 15:18.538
And when you mention the word agriculture, some of them still don't understand that is the food and fiber and the places where we work and the resources we work with.

15:18.759 --> 15:26.235
They just think of it as farming, which is a good part of it, but that's just a little bit of it, see.

15:26.502 --> 15:37.581
And so there is an education on the part of the urban students, but they still have those basic values.

15:38.061 --> 15:45.394
The land is important, people are important, the family farms, and the people need to live on the land and own the land.

15:45.434 --> 15:47.397
They still have those kind of values.

15:47.832 --> 16:01.289
Now, as you were going out and working with the high schools and the extension people, were you a comparative pioneer in that, or were you following the footsteps of some others?

16:02.130 --> 16:05.914
Well, in Texas we probably were.

16:06.195 --> 16:10.600
We were pioneering, but in other parts of the country they had had

16:11.440 --> 16:16.518
They had shown an interest in high school programs.

16:17.341 --> 16:19.047
Now, we took it another step.

16:19.107 --> 16:22.800
We wanted to get into the science programs in high school, not just the ag programs.

16:23.354 --> 16:24.836
and now they call it ag science.

16:24.896 --> 16:38.156
We wanted to get into the science program because we thought with our College of Agriculture here with all these programs like biochemistry and nutrition and genetics, that we were a very comprehensive College of Agriculture.

16:38.757 --> 16:44.586
And rather than just, you know, agronomy and entomology,

16:44.752 --> 16:47.115
and Ag Engineering.

16:47.135 --> 17:00.053
We had a broad program, you know, and that's, and as a result of that, we wanted to get to a larger group of potential students, see, and that worked.

17:00.073 --> 17:01.936
All right, how did this get created?

17:02.857 --> 17:04.639
How, what, who did y'all work through, work with?

17:04.660 --> 17:07.303
Well, see, we have county agents all over the state.

17:07.463 --> 17:13.712
Every county has access to a county agent, and what we ask them to do is to work with

17:14.283 --> 17:22.406
the counselors and science teachers in the high schools and help get access to the students.

17:22.446 --> 17:23.349
We even did this.

17:23.730 --> 17:26.959
We got a ranking of the students with their names and addresses.

17:27.462 --> 17:31.989
And so we were able to send them university information as well as college information.

17:32.529 --> 17:43.185
So many of them were, we would give them to the science colleges, students' names and addresses, and we would get just thousands of young people that were outstanding.

17:43.325 --> 17:50.095
All of them were fully qualified to be a college student, and most of them were qualified to get in A&M City.

17:50.075 --> 17:57.362
Can you share any examples of some of those experiences, specific students?

17:58.022 --> 18:05.109
Well, see, occasionally you would bring in students that didn't look like they had the ability to be at A&M.

18:05.850 --> 18:09.753
And I remember a young man named Mike.

18:09.813 --> 18:10.934
He's from the Valley.

18:11.595 --> 18:16.820
And he came to A&M, and they gave him this provisional program.

18:16.840 --> 18:19.322
He had a 650 SAT score.

18:19.420 --> 18:21.884
And his name was Mike.

18:21.904 --> 18:23.828
And I said, Mike, why are you at A&M?

18:23.848 --> 18:25.751
And he said, well, I'd like to get a degree from A&M.

18:25.812 --> 18:27.775
I said, well, you're going to have to work hard at it.

18:28.296 --> 18:31.041
He said, well, nobody else believes that I can make it at A&M.

18:31.061 --> 18:31.883
They think I'm dumb.

18:32.243 --> 18:33.025
Look at my scores.

18:33.566 --> 18:36.050
I said, well, let's see how you do in a class.

18:36.070 --> 18:37.793
And so I had him in class.

18:37.853 --> 18:39.476
And he made a B in the class.

18:39.516 --> 18:41.580
And at the end of the class, we talked about it.

18:41.560 --> 18:48.093
and he made his provisional admission and then he was here his sophomore year and he was here his junior year.

18:48.333 --> 18:50.418
At the end of his junior years, he came to see me.

18:50.738 --> 18:54.866
I was in the dean's office at the time and said, Dr. Lord, do you think I can graduate with honors?

18:55.969 --> 18:59.215
And I looked at his record and I said, well, you can make one

18:59.347 --> 19:03.073
one B, the rest you got, have to make all A's.

19:03.093 --> 19:07.760
Well, he really could have made two, but I didn't want to make it too easy for him.

19:08.180 --> 19:15.732
So the next May, when we graduated, in the part of the graduation ceremony, it shows a student's name to graduate with honor.

19:16.252 --> 19:18.416
And Mike's name was in there, graduated honors.

19:19.037 --> 19:22.922
Now, he had wanted to be a veterinarian when he came here.

19:23.583 --> 19:26.928
And we were, you know, trying to relate to these students.

19:27.469 --> 19:28.611
And I told him, well,

19:29.452 --> 19:34.265
You know, it's going to be hard for you to become a veterinarian because you have to make all these high scores and everything.

19:34.585 --> 19:35.989
But I said, let's don't worry about it.

19:36.029 --> 19:38.095
If you can't be a veterinarian, you can be something better.

19:38.536 --> 19:39.458
And he said, well, what's that?

19:39.779 --> 19:45.975
I said, you could manage your own business and hire a veterinarian as a retainer.

19:46.765 --> 19:57.000
Well, now it's been about 20 years from that, and he's in the valley, he managed a large cattle operation, and he has on a retainer, a veterinarian.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.304
I thought, now that to me is a lot of progress.

20:00.364 --> 20:07.595
I mean, if we see old Mike and somebody told him you're not capable of going to A&M, and today I don't believe that he'd get in.

20:07.855 --> 20:12.722
There ought to be some way for that to happen, but under the A&M system now, you know, that's tough.

20:12.702 --> 20:22.780
I'm not going to talk about that, though, because I've had others that have done that, too, that have come in under that provision and have graduated with a

20:23.080 --> 20:49.678
not only cum laude, they've graduated summa cum laude, and they're out there as the epitome of what an Aggie should be, and yet I know today it'd be difficult for them to get in, and I don't know, I still believe there's some way they can get here, through a junior college or some route, and I hope we don't close that door to a person who has that much potential, and this guy here, Bobby, I was thinking about him,

20:49.658 --> 21:00.917
He's now the CEO of a multi-billion dollar corporation, and yet he had a 630, and everybody told him he was so dumb that he was wasting his time at A&M, graduated at summa cum laude.

21:01.598 --> 21:09.912
But what I'm trying to emphasize is if a young person believes they can do it, and they've got one more person that believes they can do it, and somebody will help them,

21:10.060 --> 21:10.962
then they can make it.

21:11.383 --> 21:20.344
And that's what I've always tried to do, is encourage people, not build up false hope, but try to let them know if you have a high goal, you're going to have to work hard to get there.

21:20.885 --> 21:26.618
And I think that's, whether it's man or woman, I've seen women do the same thing as men have done.

21:26.935 --> 21:29.979
and they have made it and their parents have been proud of them.

21:29.999 --> 21:43.236
Turned out to be the greatest student in their whole department or college and get an award and yet at one time they were on the cast out heap, you know, they were ready to leave here.

21:45.759 --> 21:47.982
But in recruiting these students you'll get all kinds.

21:48.422 --> 21:49.804
We've had ones that

21:50.257 --> 21:52.220
The university has told them, get out of town.

21:52.240 --> 21:52.842
We don't care.

21:53.142 --> 21:54.444
Highway six, run both ways.

21:54.464 --> 21:56.047
Just take either one and go out of town.

21:56.828 --> 22:03.941
And I've helped some of those students because I feel like if they came here in the first place, they had the potential of graduating.

22:04.442 --> 22:09.210
And I know one now who goes around as a motivational speaker that I met one day on campus.

22:10.220 --> 22:13.785
And he'd been told that, and he looked like he had lost his best friend.

22:13.825 --> 22:15.448
He was just dragging his chin.

22:15.928 --> 22:18.152
And I said to him, I said, would you like to talk to me?

22:18.192 --> 22:20.175
And he said, I'd sure like to talk to somebody.

22:20.856 --> 22:22.078
And that's what I told him.

22:22.738 --> 22:28.086
And today, he's a motivational speaker going around and telling everybody.

22:28.888 --> 22:30.250
He's done very, very well.

22:30.290 --> 22:33.274
He's been on, like, on the former students' board of directors.

22:33.659 --> 22:43.075
And he tells them that story about how this professor at A&M saw him on campus one day when he was at the lowest point of his life.

22:43.676 --> 22:46.621
And they can't believe that today now that he's who he is.

22:46.741 --> 22:53.052
But he says, like I would, the life is full of peaks and valleys.

22:53.302 --> 22:55.925
And you just got to make sure there's more peaks than there are valleys.

22:55.985 --> 23:00.110
And you do that by using the ability you have and those around you.

23:00.290 --> 23:00.931
And you can do it.

23:02.373 --> 23:06.898
You became part of the college administration when?

23:06.918 --> 23:07.979
1970.

23:08.119 --> 23:09.721
All right.

23:10.462 --> 23:15.748
Describe how that came about and what your tasks were.

23:15.728 --> 23:31.054
I was in the ag economics department and related well to students and they liked that and they heard about it over at the college level and they asked me if I'd come over and help them develop one of the best and biggest ag schools in the nation.

23:31.034 --> 23:40.106
And so that's what I, that was my responsibility, to work with the programs and work with the faculty and work with the students to help get that to occur.

23:40.186 --> 23:40.666
And it did.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.110
And I was just a part of the team.

23:43.130 --> 23:45.272
And I was glad to do that.

23:45.353 --> 23:47.475
In those years, Dr. R.C.

23:47.495 --> 23:49.017
Potts was the associate dean.

23:49.097 --> 23:49.658
That's right.

23:49.678 --> 23:52.422
Describe his part of that effort.

23:52.602 --> 23:59.070
Well, his was primarily working with students and faculty and programs like curriculum and courses and things like that.

23:59.150 --> 23:59.691
He would...

23:59.671 --> 24:03.116
He would be like what we call an academic dean today.

24:03.256 --> 24:05.159
Describe how he accomplished all that.

24:05.439 --> 24:09.325
Oh, well, he was a character, you know, but he was a great guy.

24:09.826 --> 24:15.474
He just believed that every person who attends Texas A&M should make a difference in society.

24:16.055 --> 24:26.590
And I remember being a pallbearer at his funeral, and these outstanding gentlemen who were also pallbearers in that group were crying, and they were talking about,

24:27.093 --> 24:31.719
how that he had made a difference in their life, how that he had told them to stand tall.

24:32.800 --> 24:37.506
You owe Texas a lot because you got the privilege of going to A&M.

24:38.066 --> 24:44.574
And I'll never forget that because he would always bring people up.

24:44.654 --> 24:47.518
I mean, he'd see them and ask them, you know, you can do it.

24:47.658 --> 24:48.679
Shape on up.

24:48.878 --> 24:49.479
Get the help.

24:49.779 --> 24:50.280
Get it done.

24:50.781 --> 24:52.143
And he was just that kind of person.

24:52.283 --> 25:01.055
And I think most anybody who met Dr. Potts knew he was all fired up, ready to encourage you to do your best, do your best.

25:01.075 --> 25:08.505
Now, he had the ability to use both serious determination and humor, didn't he?

25:08.646 --> 25:10.348
Oh, yeah.

25:10.368 --> 25:10.708
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:10.728 --> 25:12.271
He was always getting into things.

25:12.471 --> 25:16.877
Can you give any examples you remember of where he would use...

25:18.545 --> 25:28.158
Well, yeah, he'd catch a person in an embarrassing situation and use it for good, you know, because he wouldn't let them forget it.

25:28.238 --> 25:32.424
He was the kind of guy that would hold that over your head to make you perform.

25:33.065 --> 25:35.869
And that happened several times.

25:35.889 --> 25:40.435
I mean, he worked with guys like Eddie Joe Davis, you know, here.

25:41.630 --> 25:45.153
Tommy Hartgrove, you know, who was captured in Columbia, you know.

25:45.594 --> 25:52.761
He worked with those guys and, and like, uh, Leroy Shaffer down at Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.

25:52.781 --> 26:09.397
He worked with many people like that to help them better themselves and, uh, he'd catch them in all kinds of pranks and then he would use that to cause them to stay straight, you know, because they knew if they didn't walk the line they could leave A and M pretty fast, you know.

26:09.417 --> 26:11.299
So he used that, uh,

26:11.279 --> 26:16.430
better than anybody could without, I think, without really hurting the student.

26:16.450 --> 26:17.292
He did it for good.

26:18.053 --> 26:25.690
And at the college level, was he the person that the student would go talk to most often about what courses to take?

26:26.251 --> 26:31.903
Well, at the college level, but of course in the departments you have faculty advisors.

26:32.457 --> 26:44.882
And he would deal with issues like admission and in those days the dean could readmit people and once they got in by the university admissions office from then on it was up to the academic dean.

26:44.902 --> 26:46.705
It's not that way anymore, you know.

26:46.725 --> 26:48.849
Pretty well handled now, centralized.

26:49.130 --> 26:54.280
Right, so you go over to the college level in 1970 and you're there how long?

26:54.513 --> 27:05.630
Well, I stayed even long after Dr. Potts left and Dr. Suter came, and then because I was working with students and faculty in the student relations area, and I left in 69.

27:05.650 --> 27:07.853
89, I'm sorry.

27:07.873 --> 27:07.933
89.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.435
So you're there 19 years.

27:09.455 --> 27:12.380
19 years, yes.

27:12.400 --> 27:15.925
And Kunkel was the dean for most of those years?

27:16.346 --> 27:18.529
Yes, he was.

27:18.509 --> 27:30.121
Let's see, he was, when I first came here, he was appointed dean not long after, but all the time I was there, up until the last few years when Dr. Arntzen came in.

27:30.922 --> 27:35.107
Dr. Arntzen came in, he was the dean then for a while, while I was here, over there.

27:35.127 --> 27:40.653
But then I went back to the Department of Ag Economics in about November of 89.

27:40.853 --> 27:42.795
All right.

27:44.345 --> 27:54.601
Then in the late 80s and 90s, who were the great members of this department then, the notable people?

27:55.382 --> 28:01.671
Well, of course our policy center here was Dr. Knutson.

28:01.932 --> 28:04.596
He's well recognized in ag policy across the nation.

28:05.457 --> 28:07.580
And then Dr. Capps in demand theory.

28:08.822 --> 28:12.107
He's Dr. Oral Capps.

28:12.087 --> 28:15.108
I think he's an outstanding person here.

28:15.611 --> 28:16.900
And then we have

28:18.010 --> 28:21.454
Gary Williams with the Market Research Center here.

28:22.375 --> 28:26.499
I think he's a fine person and then Dr. Nelson's the head of the department.

28:27.020 --> 28:41.175
He's just an outstanding department head and he knows how to work with faculty and encourage them and he works with the college administration and university and so I think he is a real plus for our department too.

28:41.196 --> 28:45.300
And there's other faculty too that are outstanding but

28:45.280 --> 28:47.344
I mean, I have to go through the whole list.

28:47.384 --> 28:50.910
There's about 60 of them, you know.

28:50.930 --> 29:01.450
And as far as you know, in enrollment now, how does the Department of Economics compare with the other departments in the College of Agriculture?

29:01.430 --> 29:02.853
Well, it's one of the big departments.

29:03.134 --> 29:07.806
Animal science is the largest, and then ag economics is probably second.

29:07.966 --> 29:13.419
We have about 800 undergraduates, and we have a sizable graduate program too.

29:13.520 --> 29:16.587
I don't know the number there, but in excess of 100, you know.

29:16.567 --> 29:33.900
And if we go across the United States, would we, to find a department that probably has a similar reputation to the Ag Economics Department here, we'd have to go to the Midwest or to the East Coast or the West Coast?

29:33.880 --> 29:35.163
Yes, that's right.

29:35.563 --> 29:43.580
California at Davis or North Carolina State or you'd have to go to like Purdue or Michigan State or Iowa State.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.203
Illinois, one of those places, yeah.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.468
They're all good programs, you know.

29:47.802 --> 29:52.267
but I do believe we have more students than any one of those.

29:55.090 --> 30:03.079
Let's see, what role, what's the relationship of the department to the Experiment Station and the Extension Service?

30:03.380 --> 30:09.827
Well, our department has all three of those functions within it and see some people will have

30:09.807 --> 30:15.875
joint appointments, just like I am with the experiment station and with the teaching program, see.

30:16.356 --> 30:19.640
And then some people will have an extension appointment and a teaching appointment.

30:20.121 --> 30:21.202
Normally you just have two.

30:21.242 --> 30:29.453
I doubt if, they might have two or three people who've got all three appointments, but usually it's like teaching and research or teaching and extension.

30:29.433 --> 30:37.663
And that's the land grant concept, where that you develop new knowledge, you teach it to people, and you take it to the people out in the state.

30:38.023 --> 30:44.951
Give some examples of how that is advantageous to the department, to have all three working together.

30:45.492 --> 30:52.420
Because it makes you, whatever you teach in a classroom, real, and whatever you develop research-wise,

30:52.805 --> 30:59.198
can be made available to the students right then, not after a textbook or three or four years later.

30:59.779 --> 31:06.714
You can walk out of the laboratory, so to speak, and walk into the classroom and share with them the latest discoveries or latest information.

31:07.295 --> 31:10.662
And that really works, and then you have

31:10.642 --> 31:34.337
extension people out in the state that could come into your classroom they could tell the students right there or go out at a field demonstration or whatever and see it firsthand it that that's a great concept of learning you know it's the more senses you use in teaching a subject matter it just causes more learning to occur you know that

31:34.317 --> 31:42.448
Can you give some examples in your own experience of where you were able to put those opportunities into function?

31:43.349 --> 31:51.940
Well, almost any of these projects we've done, like just a recent one on the fire ant issue, how it affects the urban setting.

31:52.601 --> 32:00.612
Now, that's an environmental issue in the classroom, you talk about it, but as far as the public is concerned,

32:00.592 --> 32:29.738
they want to know about it too and they share with us the information and then we go back and try to develop a program where that we can mitigate some of these problems and that's to me is just it just brings it all together and it's whenever you're talking or dealing with it or if you talk about like I like to deal with say land development or real estate development and I like to see that from a concept of just the

32:29.718 --> 32:43.126
visual picture of what might happen and then see it take place one day and see how it all puts together and causes all the amenities and things to be built and cause the economic growth and development to take place.

32:43.146 --> 32:46.613
So that works good though under the

32:46.593 --> 32:54.926
land-grant concept, and the extension concept, and the research concept, and teaching all put together in one triad, that type of thing.

32:56.027 --> 32:57.670
That's a land-grant concept.

32:58.170 --> 33:02.136
I'm sure you know that, and A&M being a land-grant university.

33:02.156 --> 33:04.500
I was good at that.

33:04.480 --> 33:16.001
How does it more effectively serve the urban areas now?

33:17.564 --> 33:23.335
Well, there's been more emphasis put on urban area in recent years.

33:23.355 --> 33:27.703
And of course in our extension service we have the 4-H programs.

33:27.683 --> 33:32.868
And those deal with urban as well as rural areas.

33:32.888 --> 33:38.733
And with our nutrition programs, Extension Nutrition, that goes in those programs too.

33:38.793 --> 33:44.658
And our home ecology and what we used to call home demonstration.

33:44.678 --> 33:46.920
That's still our home economics.

33:47.341 --> 33:48.242
That's still there.

33:48.682 --> 33:51.084
But they look at it more as human ecology now.

33:51.805 --> 33:57.690
And they look at the home and the needs in the home and the nutrition and all the health issues.

33:57.670 --> 34:01.058
That, I think, makes a difference.

34:01.119 --> 34:11.865
I think that makes a difference by approaching it from that standpoint, and the college has

34:12.352 --> 34:23.550
an audience in the urban areas now because of the landscape horticulture and the environmental or urban entomology and urban forestry.

34:23.871 --> 34:28.538
All these programs address that fringe area and also it moves on into the urban.

34:28.518 --> 34:32.024
completely into the central cities, you know.

34:32.465 --> 34:40.899
But as you know, as urbans grow out, they grow taking over ag areas so that we have to interact with that.

34:41.300 --> 34:42.422
There's no doubt about that.

34:42.842 --> 34:50.476
And I think agriculture has a lot to offer there in helping people as they move and integrate these to urban and rural.

34:50.676 --> 34:52.018
I mean, that's happening all over.

34:52.419 --> 34:54.863
If you look at Dallas and around Houston,

34:54.843 --> 34:58.488
San Antonio or Austin or any of the big cities, you'll see that taking place.

34:58.528 --> 35:02.193
And I think we have a lot to offer there on the College of Agriculture.

35:02.914 --> 35:04.876
All right, now I've been looking at my notes.

35:05.657 --> 35:07.960
What have we not touched on that we should have?

35:08.942 --> 35:13.127
Okay, you've asked me pretty well about our college, about our department.

35:14.549 --> 35:19.095
There's another, some little trivia things here I thought were pretty neat.

35:19.717 --> 35:24.123
A&M has now they'll accept the ACT score and SAT score.

35:24.604 --> 35:35.158
Now, I don't know whether we want to put that here or not, but I did the research behind that to show that they were equally significant predictors, so to speak.

35:35.178 --> 35:40.105
And so the university agreed to accept both of those scores for admission.

35:40.085 --> 35:50.915
And on the grade report that comes out at the end of the semester, they used to only put grade points on there and didn't put the grade point ratio on there.

35:50.935 --> 35:56.280
So I asked the Red Star's office to do that, and they put the grade point ratio on there.

35:56.300 --> 36:02.906
One place they have not put the grade point ratio, which I think they should, is on their transcript, and they haven't done that.

36:03.086 --> 36:10.092
And I would suggest that you do that because it puts our students at a disadvantage when you're looking for national scholarships.

36:10.072 --> 36:20.489
because people look at that and there may be a B in the PE or something like that and it distorts the grade point ratio if you don't have it calculated.

36:21.130 --> 36:23.935
But anyway, that's a little insignificant thing.

36:23.955 --> 36:28.823
In your experience, what are the most

36:30.693 --> 36:36.602
important pre-admission scores.

36:37.964 --> 36:38.224
Is it?

36:38.244 --> 36:39.085
Or indicators?

36:39.946 --> 36:43.051
Well, a lot of people have said how they've done in high school.

36:44.633 --> 36:50.001
And I would say if you know the high schools you're talking about, that is a good predictor.

36:50.200 --> 37:01.997
And, of course, I do believe that standardized test scores is another indicator, but I would like to know what they've done other than just go to class.

37:02.017 --> 37:08.968
I mean, if they've been in activities and they've got good grades and they've got good scores, well, you have an automatic success.

37:09.288 --> 37:11.531
I mean, it's just almost a sure bet.

37:12.373 --> 37:19.363
But as anybody knows, the high school you're from and how you did in that high school,

37:19.343 --> 37:28.154
and activities you had other than just academic, it helps determine whether you'll succeed or not, yeah.

37:28.174 --> 37:34.502
But I don't, I think it's, some people look at the quarter of the class you graduate in, but I think it's just how you stack up.

37:34.562 --> 37:46.057
I mean, if you're in that 90 plus category and you've been in a good high school, you can probably do that, do well enough to pass at A&M and succeed, yeah.

37:46.077 --> 37:48.760
There's a, let's see, what else on here?

37:48.875 --> 37:52.779
Oh, we started a new little club here, which is a student club called the Fire Club.

37:53.259 --> 38:17.582
That's students who have an interest in careers in finance, insurance, and real estate, and law and environmental issues, which is, I think, is just right on the front row because it, within the last year, the United States government has passed a law that permits security firms, banks, and the insurance companies to deal in the same products.

38:17.562 --> 38:32.259
So we need to have a student organization here that helps young people find early in their college career these opportunities available to them and not discover them after they get out of school or get to be a junior or senior.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.142
And so we've got that recognized.

38:35.202 --> 38:40.188
It's chartered now and it's recognized by the university organization, student organization.

38:40.769 --> 38:44.413
That's one of the neat things that I've done in the last year here, which is

38:44.393 --> 39:10.907
really good and it's uh it's doing fine it's a good club and uh let's see i don't see any uh other major things here other than you i'm sure you've heard the story of old bess and pat murphy jr haven't you you know how that a m had this uh mule here that would uh

39:12.153 --> 39:19.672
She was an unusual phenomenon that if you bred her to a quarter horse, she would breed and she would have a quarter horse.

39:19.953 --> 39:25.707
If you bred her to a donkey, a jack, she would have a mule and her name was Old Bess.

39:26.024 --> 39:33.014
And for a long time, they had the stall for door for old Pat Murphy, Jr.

39:33.054 --> 39:36.159
That's one of her famous colts.

39:36.399 --> 39:40.566
It became a really good horse.

39:40.586 --> 39:43.470
He's Pat Murphy, Jr., and he's sort of famous.

39:43.811 --> 39:52.784
And they had his gate that used to be over there in one of those little Calvary buildings down there, to the stall.

39:52.924 --> 39:55.508
They left it there for a long time, but they finally took it out.

39:55.488 --> 40:07.280
And then for a long time in our museum here, they had the head of old Bess, that was the old mule, and neck, and they had the head and neck of Pat Murphy Jr.

40:07.440 --> 40:22.356
And I've seen those heads, and the story was told that occasionally they'd get into the museum, students, Aggies would, and steal like old Bess there, particularly old Bess, head because she's an old floppy-eared mule, and they would

40:23.703 --> 40:42.437
They would put that head, you remember, at the top of the windows of a professor's door, they had a window up there, it'd pull down, and they'd put that head up there and stuff it in there and put a big placard around his neck, and if they didn't like the professor, and it said, and the other end is inside.

40:44.678 --> 40:47.187
Now, did that happen after you got here?

40:47.227 --> 40:49.415
No, but I did see it after I got here.

40:49.435 --> 40:56.460
I saw the, because by that time they had taken the heads out of the

40:56.575 --> 41:02.241
old museum, which used to be over there where Langford Architecture Building is.

41:02.261 --> 41:04.504
So that old Bess goes back maybe into the 20s?

41:05.044 --> 41:10.130
I don't know how far she goes back, but I don't know whether Detloff mentioned it or not.

41:10.150 --> 41:11.711
She had expired before you got here.

41:11.731 --> 41:14.494
Oh yes, yes, yes, and so had Pat Murphy Jr., see.

41:14.935 --> 41:21.722
But that's an interesting story, and it's a genetic phenomenon too, how that she, they said that she had both

41:21.702 --> 41:28.739
reproductive tracts in her body, unusual genetic phenomena, because a mule is supposed to be sterile.

41:28.759 --> 41:32.248
It's a hybrid, you know, and it's supposed to be sterile, but she was unusual.

41:32.849 --> 41:35.155
And I also talked to the people

41:35.725 --> 41:51.467
who used to work over at the, you remember Bob Logan, and his brother George, they used to work at the poultry farm, and his brother used to ride old Pat Murphy Jr., and they knew old Bess and everything when they were students here.

41:51.808 --> 41:53.770
But that's an interesting story in itself.

41:53.871 --> 41:55.573
I thought that was, you'd like that.

41:56.465 --> 42:16.795
And I don't know where those heads are now, but I knew at one time Nat Kiefer had those old heads, and he could probably tell us where they are, you know, but I was really, I regret that they didn't maintain that in our museum forever, you know.

42:16.815 --> 42:17.756
I thought you'd like that.

42:18.257 --> 42:22.303
And you probably know that our cyclotron here, which is right next door,

42:23.077 --> 42:28.024
was acquired and gotten here by John Calhoun and Bob Cochran.

42:28.045 --> 42:36.738
They're the two guys that worked with a congressman in Washington to get that nuclear reactor over there.

42:36.898 --> 42:37.739
I thought that was good.

42:37.779 --> 42:40.744
You know Bob in our Rotary Club, yeah?

42:41.465 --> 42:42.887
He's good there.

42:43.508 --> 42:46.152
I had another thing that happened to you.

42:46.452 --> 42:48.415
This is just with a student.

42:48.435 --> 42:50.198
She was in high school.

42:50.178 --> 43:08.035
in a big high school in Houston, and she was the drum major and student body president, and she wanted, I knew her sister here, and she wanted to come and visit, like you would come a senior day, so, you know, where they can have a college day, so she came and visited with me, and I visited with her,

43:08.015 --> 43:12.746
and talked with her about our college and about the university and about our department.

43:13.327 --> 43:20.504
Well, I didn't know it, but she came from that big high school that she was going to do this and became a major in ag economics.

43:20.524 --> 43:24.032
And then about three years ago at Christmas, I got a letter from her

43:24.012 --> 43:28.158
And I helped her like for law school and letters and things like that.

43:28.438 --> 43:37.452
And she wrote me a letter and said that she wanted to thank me because every turn that she had made in her life, I was there to help her.

43:37.952 --> 43:53.395
And that what she did at A&M and law school and today, she's putting it all to work because she wanted to use that environmental law issues and she wanted to use the agribusiness aspects.

43:53.375 --> 44:02.148
And today she is an attorney for environmental compliance for a large oil company that also has a lot of agribusiness.

44:02.749 --> 44:08.938
And so she says, everything that she's done, it just fits to a T. And I thought, oh, man.

44:08.958 --> 44:11.502
Here I visited when she was a high school

44:11.482 --> 44:14.287
And she was a drama major and student body president.

44:14.788 --> 44:19.337
And then for her to tell me all these things that happened made me feel like that made my day.

44:20.099 --> 44:20.600
Made my day.

44:20.900 --> 44:27.693
So when you touch a student's life, you ought to realize that it will make a difference.

44:27.713 --> 44:28.835
And you should not hurt them.

44:29.436 --> 44:31.220
You should help them.

44:31.240 --> 44:32.342
And that's what I've always...

44:32.592 --> 44:41.684
tried to emphasize to all their young faculty as well as to myself to make a difference and a positive difference, a good difference.

44:41.704 --> 44:50.355
Now another thing we did here to help get all those students interested in our A&M and also in our college, we had career days.

44:51.416 --> 44:56.403
Now we used to have those career days, only agriculture and engineering had those career days initially.

44:57.043 --> 45:00.608
And I was, I was a chair of that

45:00.588 --> 45:24.435
committee for 19 years and we ended up sometimes we'd have like 5,000 young people come here and we'd visit over like in Zachary and had all those exhibits and everything but those days now they do have some some career days now but I believe they call them something different than that now but that was another good way of students learning about A&M.

45:25.883 --> 45:34.256
How could we, in the future, increase our ability to make prospective students better aware of A&M?

45:35.438 --> 45:36.439
What else could we do?

45:36.559 --> 45:43.470
Well, we have these centers, as you probably know, that are located like in Houston and San Antonio.

45:43.450 --> 45:56.293
I think we can use the internet a lot better for that purpose, just like let students plug in at A&M and find out, well, just explore into those areas.

45:56.794 --> 45:57.775
What would I do?

45:57.875 --> 46:06.150
You can put up a lot of animated stuff and a lot of information there that would allow them to explore this if we just had it

46:06.130 --> 46:12.064
on a web page where that they could say, okay, I want to go into this area at A&M.

46:12.585 --> 46:16.855
Click, click, and there it would pop up and, well, tell me, what would I do?

46:17.035 --> 46:19.581
Click, click, give me some examples.

46:19.882 --> 46:21.365
Give me some names of some former students.

46:21.386 --> 46:22.468
It all just click, click.

46:22.448 --> 46:23.369
We could do that.

46:23.410 --> 46:23.950
That would help.

46:24.712 --> 46:26.014
I would think that we could do that.

46:26.715 --> 46:30.201
I haven't tried to do that, and I don't know the university is doing that.

46:30.942 --> 46:46.687
But I want us to keep trying to tell people about our programs and about A&M because it's important that we inform people and we join in that selection process rather than them coming just to us.

46:46.988 --> 46:49.131
I just feel like we need to be a part of it.
