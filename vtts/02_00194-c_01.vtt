00:02.866 --> 00:22.473
You know, that that was not my strong suit, but I 
had, I think I've always exhibited common sense

00:02.866 --> 00:22.473
and some leadership ability apparently, and they 
gave me credit for what I had and did not diminish me

00:02.866 --> 00:22.473
for what I did not have. During your student era, 
Describe generally the attitudes of the typical

00:28.111 --> 00:34.037
Aggie student. Were they rich, poor, 
conservative, liberal, what? Conservative and

00:39.643 --> 00:41.465
poor. There were a handful of guys that had cars, so 
you thought they were rich. Just to have a car, you

00:47.852 --> 00:49.694
had to be rich. And where did they come from 
geographically? Everywhere. And in today's

00:55.668 --> 01:02.441
politically correct definition of diversity, 
how diverse was the student body? It wasn't. It

01:04.165 --> 01:04.646
wasn't. I remember quite a few Hispanics, like I 
described earlier. I know drill team. We had an

01:11.079 --> 01:16.309
enormous number of guys from Central Catholic 
High School. And how were those Hispanics

01:16.593 --> 01:18.495
treated? Just like, I think everybody was treated 
just exactly the same. I don't think there was a bit

01:22.558 --> 01:24.000
of difference. To my knowledge, there was no 
difference while I was a student. Were there any,

01:29.765 --> 01:36.671
well, by the time you graduated, there were some 
black students. There were a handful. I didn't

01:38.072 --> 01:39.413
personally know any. I knew them, you know, just I 
knew some names of two or three of them, but I didn't

01:39.674 --> 01:45.739
really know any of them. All right. How does that 
relate to whatever Aggie spirit is? What is Aggie

01:52.631 --> 01:53.992
spirit?

02:01.300 --> 02:16.637
The impact is that I think you end up with knowing 
individuals, be they student friends that become

02:01.300 --> 02:16.637
lifelong members or the even if it is two or three 
faculty or staff that you remember, the impact of

02:17.174 --> 02:39.780
silver taps and muster and a few ceremonies, and 
the fact that you had an experience that just molds

02:17.174 --> 02:39.780
you to be prepared to do whatever you decide you 
want to do. And that ends up equaling a spirit. And

02:45.322 --> 02:53.354
then you learn right away that the former students 
that are out there are going to accept you

02:45.322 --> 02:53.354
immediately.

02:55.037 --> 02:59.103
It doesn't matter if it says double ought or 65. The 
number on the ring is immaterial to everybody that

02:59.544 --> 03:04.051
has one. Does the person's academic major matter? 
Not to the spirit. It doesn't matter. You've got 25

03:14.698 --> 03:16.921
years now. You've got to give different answers 
for the last 20 years, and especially the last 10

03:17.382 --> 03:34.787
years, because the quality of the guy that had a 
diploma from high school has long ago not been able

03:17.382 --> 03:34.787
to get in here. But you still have these 
high-quality young people that want to be touched

03:42.545 --> 03:55.538
by the spirit and the Aggie connection and the 
friendships and see all of that when they're

03:42.545 --> 03:55.538
coming in the door and want to be impacted by it 
immediately. The stories of these 12 kids that

03:56.739 --> 04:12.315
lost their lives this year, absolutely awesome 
young people to where it reminds you that that's

03:56.739 --> 04:12.315
what all of them are. It wasn't just accidentally 
that 12. That is the example. They are all like

04:19.889 --> 04:21.130
that. An enormous number of them are 
valedictorians. An enormous number of those guys

04:24.914 --> 04:28.457
were all Eagle Scouts. They did try to help people 
while they were up there on that stack and point at

04:29.197 --> 04:34.502
somebody else. I mean, just awesome young people 
that Through this period of time, what they're

04:42.586 --> 04:48.795
going to do in the next 50 years is anything they 
want to go do. And the leadership examples that

04:50.498 --> 05:00.091
will be available 40 years from now compared to the 
leadership examples that are available now will

04:50.498 --> 05:00.091
be off the books. Now, in your day, not many 
students went to fish camp, did they? No, it was

05:07.662 --> 05:09.885
summer school at Junction. Yeah, yeah. It had the 
same role. It was limited for that reason. I

05:15.612 --> 05:18.856
couldn't afford to go that summer or I would have 
probably gone. It would have been good for me if I

05:18.876 --> 05:20.678
could have gone. Because I today think that part of 
the Aggie spirit. We have 4,000 freshmen of 6,300

05:25.003 --> 05:28.848
that go through fish camp. And so they get 
connected immediately. Yep, yep. You have 11,000

05:32.080 --> 05:37.727
kids live on campus out of the 36,000 
undergraduates. It's huge. The residential

05:39.337 --> 05:47.489
living is a huge part of feeling connected and 
knowing people and the involvement level. And

05:48.150 --> 05:53.738
I'll bring back another day for just a five or ten 
minute visit. I've got some data gathered. If you

05:58.285 --> 06:07.318
measure the quality of the student body by the 
percentage of all undergraduates who were in the

05:58.285 --> 06:07.318
top ten percent of their high school class, This is 
the best student body in the Big 12. Tech, Kansas

06:10.855 --> 06:13.839
State, and Nebraska are at the bottom. Texas is 
second. When I mention this to anybody, I try to

06:17.084 --> 06:31.365
always indicate one of the great blessings Texas 
A&M has is to have another top-notch public school

06:17.084 --> 06:31.365
100 miles away, and everything they achieve, we 
want to outdo and vice versa, ratchet each other

06:17.084 --> 06:31.365
up. that we have a comparatively, compared to most 
schools, have a comparatively high percentage

06:31.531 --> 06:38.301
living on campus. We're eighth in the country on 
campus living. We have about 91% of the students

06:44.571 --> 06:52.223
went to high school in Texas, but the diversity 
geographically is increasing and that's

06:44.571 --> 06:52.223
healthy. And the great problem of the future is how 
many students to enroll and how do you select them?

06:59.811 --> 07:01.273
Do you get more and more and more? That's a 
difficult one. I'm the only guy that would like to

07:04.276 --> 07:16.769
go to 55,000

07:04.276 --> 07:16.769
because you do not change the quality of the kids 
coming in by going to 55,000. No. Because the 4,000

07:18.477 --> 07:23.105
turned down this year were fully qualified. And by 
expectation would be doing just as well as anybody

07:23.165 --> 07:30.897
as the ones that were admitted. The limitation is 
resources, space, faculty, time. Let's see. Only

07:40.934 --> 07:43.658
two or three things left.

07:47.047 --> 07:50.251
What do you think it meant to you that you attended 
Texas A&M?

07:53.074 --> 08:15.282
For my background coming from the family that I did 
and having the chance to get a college education

07:53.074 --> 08:15.282
and then have a, at least at that moment, a very 
clear direction of military service put me off on a

07:53.074 --> 08:15.282
road that gave me a chance to change my mind later. 
What did you learn at Texas A&M, defining the word

08:16.460 --> 08:22.450
learn now in its broadest? I think that I had 
reinforced family values of integrity. I think I

08:30.383 --> 08:32.106
learned integrity. I learned common sense, hard 
work, the right way to do something. began to learn

08:40.203 --> 08:51.301
the importance of friendships and how to nurture 
them and make them work and appreciate them.

08:55.087 --> 09:02.920
I've had a chance to give back to a degree greater 
than almost anybody has. But I'm very grateful

09:03.355 --> 09:10.943
that I've had that chance because I wouldn't have 
mounted to a hill of beans. All right. The next to

09:12.485 --> 09:13.466
last one. Let's make believe somebody walked up to 
you when the lottery is finished tonight and

09:13.506 --> 09:22.936
handed you a million-dollar check with only one 
condition. You must pass it on to A&M, but you can

09:23.677 --> 09:28.261
decide what use to be made of it. What would you? It 
would be the Malin Sutherland Quality of Student

09:28.742 --> 09:32.586
Life Endowment.

09:35.317 --> 09:52.287
where the Vice President for Student Affairs can 
decide what student needs $500 to go to England or

09:35.317 --> 09:52.287
$500 to pay the rent or whatever good purpose, 
educational or need-based. I've run into many,

09:53.148 --> 09:55.873
many old-timers who say that the opportunity 
award which their FFA or their advisor helped them

09:56.326 --> 10:04.178
to get literally changed their life. Last 
question. What feelings do you hold in your heart

10:05.841 --> 10:08.866
for Texas A&M? We don't have enough time. You'll 
have to bring another tape. The quality of the

10:14.896 --> 10:20.224
people that I have known and been touched by and 
maybe had the ability to touch to some degree is

10:20.778 --> 10:46.684
enormous and is not the experience that most human 
beings get to have in the full power of a

10:20.778 --> 10:46.684
relationship from knowing an 18-year-old 
freshman to knowing them as a four-star general.

10:48.335 --> 11:08.929
and the enormous change that happens and that you 
can see and see what the ability to have some

10:48.335 --> 11:08.929
success in an environment at A&M really prepares 
you dramatically well for the real world. Let's

11:09.710 --> 11:10.832
quit there.
