WEBVTT

00:03.119 --> 00:04.881
the 12th, testing, testing. Okay, am I speaking 
here? I'm testing also, and got a frog in my voice it

00:07.623 --> 00:12.628
sounds like, but I think I'll work through it. This 
is March the 12th, and we're at 1709 Glade, and I

00:14.110 --> 00:30.045
have the honor and joy of chatting with Robert 
Spode, S-P-O-D-E. No, S-P-O-E-D-E. Oh,

00:14.110 --> 00:30.045
S-P-O-E-D, oh, thank you, thank you. German 
umlaut, old German umlaut. Oh. What does that mean

00:32.262 --> 00:33.183
in German? Do you know? I have no idea. We're 
searching and searching. Cannot find it. Quite

00:37.189 --> 00:42.556
possibly has something to do with ashes from which 
you make china, porcelain, and stuff like that. We

00:42.576 --> 00:46.201
wonder if there's a relationship with Spode China 
in England. And my grandfather's citizen papers

00:46.822 --> 00:50.547
had SVO . To

00:51.168 --> 01:01.122
introduce yourself to anyone who would read this 
transcript or hear this tape, Tell us about your

01:01.861 --> 01:04.543
family background. Give us a brief biographical 
sketch of you until you came to A&M. Where'd you

01:11.670 --> 01:13.771
grow up and family and so forth? I was born in a farm 
out in the midst of the cotton patch in Austin

01:13.952 --> 01:23.440
County near the hamlet or village of Wallace, 
Texas. My parents at that time were sharecropping

01:25.722 --> 01:31.767
farmers for their on land owned by their parents, 
my father's parents, who were German. And they had

01:38.169 --> 01:41.353
about four farms that they had. They shared the 
produce and the crops on.

01:47.922 --> 02:00.319
My family, my background and lineage is that of 
German, basically peasant Germans who came over

01:47.922 --> 02:00.319
here at 1880 as teenagers and met over here in the 
vicinity of New York. One was my grandmother was

02:00.704 --> 02:07.311
Catholic, my grandfather was Protestant, 
Lutheran. They got married.

02:11.135 --> 02:19.824
Many interesting things there, but they were 
successful in a truck farm about where

02:11.135 --> 02:19.824
Meadowlands football field is now. And my father 
used to tell them, taking the truck with the

02:20.565 --> 02:24.869
produce over to the markets in New York City. But 
anyway, they sold that farm, came around by boat to

02:25.330 --> 02:30.475
Galveston, in Austin County and bought land from 
my mother's parents who had come into Texas about

02:31.012 --> 02:41.545
1855 in

02:31.012 --> 02:41.545
Wallace, Texas and established there. Then when I 
was six years old, we moved across the Gracious

02:41.946 --> 02:53.480
River from Austin County into Fort Bend County 
where my father there was sharecropping land

02:41.946 --> 02:53.480
owned by my mother's father. Now he had a much 
larger holding. He had about 1400 acres and had

02:55.523 --> 02:59.668
about 10 acres sharecroppers, 10, 11, 12 
sharecroppers. Now, these were basically

03:02.273 --> 03:05.317
Mexican sharecroppers. What was the money crop 
then? Cotton. Cotton. You grew almost most of the

03:09.302 --> 03:11.405
cotton, a little bit of corn. Then you grew 
vegetables for your own use and cows and pigs and

03:12.467 --> 03:17.894
stuff like that. And the railroad ran through that 
area by then? The railroad went through there. In

03:21.439 --> 03:27.647
fact, the town of Wallace, Hamlet, could well have 
been named for my mother's family, Giler. because

03:27.948 --> 03:32.553
they gave a good portion of the land of the town when 
they built the railroad through there. And it

03:33.094 --> 03:39.321
moved Beaubing Bend, Texas, which was on the 
Brazos River, over into along the railroad. And

03:39.661 --> 03:41.624
Beaubing Bend, of course, no longer exists. And it 
was from there that my mother's father left home in

03:42.465 --> 03:54.298
1878 by ox cart and driven. And there is an article. 
way back about him, written by him on his trip to

03:56.450 --> 04:00.634
A&M. It was written for the Texas Ivy publication. 
It wasn't the magazine it is now. It was pulp paper.

04:07.361 --> 04:15.910
And coming there with his black hooker to pop the 
fly off of an ox, you know, with his whip and so on.

04:15.930 --> 04:22.057
They went to Hockley and there he got on the train 
and came to A&M on the train in 1878. Now with him, He

04:25.728 --> 04:29.993
did not finish A&M because he got in a knife fight as 
about a 14-year-old. He was about 14. It was a

04:30.834 --> 04:31.936
three-year curriculum. A&M was then really kind 
of a high school for him. And he got in a knife fight

04:37.583 --> 04:39.986
and had to drop out of school. But he loved A&M all 
the years of his life. Are you saying N-I-G-H-T,

04:42.509 --> 04:47.175
knight, or K-N-I-F-E? Knife fight. A knife fight. 
K-N-I-F-E. Yeah, with knives. With knives. Was

04:52.041 --> 04:53.402
anybody hurt, or do you know? He was hurt. I don't 
know who else was hurt. But he was a violent man. He

04:57.545 --> 05:02.012
was a, I know he killed at least one man later on. Was 
he, in today's terminology, did he have an

05:02.032 --> 05:06.638
academic major? I don't know. He was, but he loved 
history, loved learning. It demonstrated to me

05:12.347 --> 05:22.882
and incited an interest in me because he named his 
horses Saxon and, what was the other one? There's

05:22.902 --> 05:25.466
another, one of the other Germanic tribes. 
Mm-hmm. Not Engle, but Saxon and something else.

05:31.426 --> 05:33.509
Vandals, Saxon and Vandals. So he was here almost 
three years? No, about one year. Oh, one year. He

05:40.477 --> 05:45.544
was here at the same time, probably the same. 
Houston's son was here. And, of course, everybody

05:47.746 --> 05:49.568
lived on the campus. Lived on the campus. Lived in 
Gayford Hall at that time. But, in fact, he was a

05:51.871 --> 05:54.775
high school student. Really a high school 
student. He was born in April of 1865, and he

05:57.241 --> 06:08.175
enrolled in, I guess, fall of 1878. So you figure 
out he was about 13. Did you hear any stories about

06:12.320 --> 06:20.210
how he got to college, got to the campus, and did he 
always go by cart or wagon? I don't know how he got

06:22.052 --> 06:23.294
back. No, I don't know. No, I didn't. Any family 
souvenirs, keepsakes from him? I was the youngest

06:30.689 --> 06:32.191
grandson. His son and his son's son were the first 
three-generation family to come in here. None of

06:40.243 --> 06:41.264
them graduated. I and my brother were the second 
and third. Many of our family came in here who ever

06:46.512 --> 06:50.639
graduated. So you're his grandson. I'm his 
grandson. Okay, he goes back into farming. He goes

06:58.068 --> 07:19.257
back into farming and he also had a general store 
and his farming when I was in doctoral program they

06:58.068 --> 07:19.257
talked about how did they keep the plantations 
going and the way they described was exactly he had

06:58.068 --> 07:19.257
a commissary in his backyard when I knew him and His 
tenants would come in and buy on credit from the

07:20.047 --> 07:29.322
commissary, and then when the cotton was sold, 
they would settle their accounts and have

07:20.047 --> 07:29.322
nothing. And his tenants were Hispanic, were 
Mexican-American. Right, right, not black. And

07:36.714 --> 07:44.907
then my father and my mother, but there's a lot of 
story that he promised him 200 acres of land or

07:36.714 --> 07:44.907
something, but he never came through with it. Now, 
did your dad come to A&M? My dad never finished high

07:46.372 --> 07:48.414
school. His father thought seventh grade 
education was enough for any former. He was going

07:52.978 --> 07:54.259
to be a former. And he never finished high school. 
But he did marry my mother, who had gone to CIA,

07:59.824 --> 08:04.489
College of Industrial Arts. It didn't later, 
Texas State College of Women. Now, Texas Women's

08:06.250 --> 08:08.673
University, Sister's School, A&M. And she had a 
certificate. That was a three-year program, too,

08:12.556 --> 08:14.438
when she went there. And she didn't have a 
bachelor's, but she could teach school. And she

08:17.978 --> 08:19.460
helped him a lot. And he, World War I, he was drafted 
and won the Army and was selected for also Kennedy

08:19.620 --> 08:31.553
School, because he could name the equivalent 
ranks in the Navy to the Army. It was a big thing. And

08:33.856 --> 08:35.377
got a commission. And during the 20s and 30s, he 
went back to farming. And in the 20s and 30s, he kept

08:39.241 --> 08:41.544
his commission active. And then in 1936, he was 
called to the Army.

08:47.594 --> 09:00.605
And we moved from Simonton, Texas, where I started 
school two years, first and second grade in a

08:47.594 --> 09:00.605
two-room schoolhouse, grades one to six there, 
and moved to Lufkin. Then we moved to Waco, all

09:00.625 --> 09:10.193
transferred by the CCC, then to Marshall, Texas, 
then to Fort Worth, Texas, and that's where we

09:00.625 --> 09:10.193
worked when Pearl Harbor started. And he was 
called to active duty, I mean, with active army,

09:10.494 --> 09:16.639
and went to San Antonio, where he was 
pro-Marshall, of wartime San Antonio, 500,000,

09:17.007 --> 09:28.260
and he had to keep order downtown San Antonio, and 
with no, no police experience, no college degree.

09:29.121 --> 09:38.793
But he did a good job, and he was chosen to be the 
technical expert for a training field called town

09:29.121 --> 09:38.793
patrolling. And he went to Hollywood. We can't 
imagine my father in Hollywood. All right, so

09:43.147 --> 09:46.630
you're in high school at Jefferson? I was in high 
school at San Antonio, graduated in June the 3rd, I

09:46.750 --> 09:56.440
think, 1944, Friday night. Sunday, we were at A&M. 
My best friend and I came to A&M on that, and we came

10:00.043 --> 10:11.854
in his parents' car, pre-war car, not big, and all 
of our possessions were in the trunk of that car for

10:12.509 --> 10:17.115
two of us. Maybe a little radio, I don't know. So you 
enrolled in the summer school? We came and we were

10:21.601 --> 10:24.144
enrolling on D-Day. Our class was very proud of the 
fact that, and I was, with my interest in current

10:24.624 --> 10:38.382
events, history, I was about to go crazy because I 
could hear the radios talking about the invasion,

10:24.624 --> 10:38.382
you know, and I had to stand in line. What

10:38.902 --> 10:50.993
do you think was the attitude of your buddies and 
everybody else about whether or not D-Day would

10:38.902 --> 10:50.993
succeed? Were Americans optimistic? We assumed 
it would. We were optimistic, for sure. Then never

10:56.958 --> 10:59.340
dreamt it not succeeding. I mean, that was the 
first time it ever crossed my mind. I'm looking

11:02.943 --> 11:07.407
back, you know, that there was... My dad was... 
woodworker in the shipyard in Orange. And we're

11:11.360 --> 11:13.843
driving back to Garland to visit family. And I've 
got the radio on the whole time. And that night, my

11:16.506 --> 11:20.851
grandmother let me sleep on a pallet in the living 
room. And I put the radio right near my pillow and

11:21.492 --> 11:26.077
turned it and listened to it all night. And I 
particularly remember some of the famous radio

11:26.578 --> 11:31.784
voices giving live reports. Here comes a dive 
bomber. Here comes a this. Here comes a that. Well,

11:35.467 --> 11:45.557
I did that with Edward R. Murrow, a reporter from 
London, in describing the fight that won the Fair

11:35.467 --> 11:45.557
Plains, you know. Let's back up. When did you get 
the encouragement to go to college? How early did

11:52.705 --> 11:59.652
you, now in hindsight, realize that you were 
destined to go to college?

12:02.517 --> 12:11.389
at the earliest possible time, when you even begin 
to think about that, it was a given from, I guess,

12:02.517 --> 12:11.389
from my mother. My father also, he wanted to go to 
A&M. If he could have gone to school, and he loved

12:14.894 --> 12:31.697
the school, and the juncture of being a reserve 
officer and forming, coming together in the Corps

12:14.894 --> 12:31.697
of Cadets, and marrying the daughter of a person 
who loved this school dearly, and who, in fact, has

12:31.930 --> 12:38.698
the oldest foundation, and the former students 
is, I think, Hibbs. And his name's not very big, you

12:38.718 --> 12:41.121
know, about $2,000. But I think it's the oldest one 
there. But he loved this school. They all did. All

12:47.629 --> 12:48.350
right. When you came to enroll that summer, what 
did you bring physically? What stuff did you have?

12:56.580 --> 13:00.925
Some underwear, some civilian clothes, not much. 
Maybe

13:01.597 --> 13:07.082
two days of clothing at the most, three days, I 
mean. You said maybe a radio. Maybe a radio. Any

13:11.666 --> 13:12.127
other? Well, I wasn't shaving yet, so I didn't have 
to bring any razor or anything. Probably, I guess I

13:18.513 --> 13:20.775
brought a toothbrush. Not much. I mean, not very 
much. Do you remember your parents or anyone else

13:23.837 --> 13:28.121
giving you any last-minute advice, counsel? No. I

13:30.622 --> 13:39.175
was a very compliant boy. Very obedient. That 
never gave them any trouble. I get very much a

13:44.863 --> 13:47.788
family thing here. I'd seen my mother cry an awful 
lot from phone calls. And I was the youngest of

13:53.236 --> 13:54.538
three boys. And I never wanted her to get a phone 
call from me or about me that made her cry. I've had

14:02.383 --> 14:03.425
enough of that. And so, if she told me to be in at 10 
o'clock, I was in at 10 o'clock. Not only she

14:12.758 --> 14:19.048
didn't, she wasn't that restrictive, if you don't 
understand me, but I was very compliant. I've

14:19.388 --> 14:20.370
always been very compliant. Therefore, I had no 
trouble at A&M as a patient. Why did you come to

14:23.354 --> 14:27.460
summer school instead of waiting for the fall? 
Well, when I finished high school, my brother had

14:28.132 --> 14:34.158
been lost as a Marine Corps fighter pilot off 
Guadalcanal. And

14:35.540 --> 14:40.345
I wanted to join the Marines. So my folks, I wanted 
to join the Marines as soon as I graduated. My

14:44.089 --> 14:49.675
mother, having lost one son, asked me, she said, 
Robert, would you please get one semester of

14:44.089 --> 14:49.675
college in? And at that time, me and Amber ran three 
semesters in one year. And... I said, all right.

14:59.185 --> 15:03.371
They said, you can get a summer semester in before 
you turn 18. I did not want to sign up for the draft. I

15:09.239 --> 15:14.126
was super patriotic, I think. And to sign up for the 
draft meant I was going reluctantly. And I did not

15:20.535 --> 15:25.662
want that on my record, so I never wanted to be 
eligible for the draft. So I wanted to sign up when I

15:26.435 --> 15:28.077
was 17. And they lived up to theirs. I lived up to 
mine. And I went down to San Antonio and signed up.

15:37.008 --> 15:45.278
And when I got through, the officer there said, 
recommend you go back to college because we've got

15:37.008 --> 15:45.278
55 people ahead of you. And we think you can never 
get another semester in. And so I went back to

15:49.323 --> 15:56.172
college as a Marine Corps private reserve. and got 
all but two weeks of the fall semester, and the

15:56.894 --> 16:04.624
college gave me credit for the semester. All 
right, back to that summer.

16:10.011 --> 16:13.716
Was it pretty well a full semester in terms of the 
number of students? Was it a big number? We have a

16:15.859 --> 16:16.980
very small class. I'm class co-agent of my class 
now, and it's the most we ever had in the class, and

16:17.000 --> 16:26.833
that's counting some that came in in August and 
September. kind of son who came in immediately at

16:27.235 --> 16:56.415
the war and went through real quickly and 
graduated in 48 and some transfer to graduate in 48

16:27.235 --> 16:56.415
and the total class at the biggest was 900 the total 
number of the class alright describe y'all you

16:27.235 --> 16:56.415
came with this friend and y'all drive up where did 
you go to to kind of report we got a letter Parents

16:57.813 --> 17:15.716
got a letter, bring your darling, I mean, I'm 
paraphrasing, putting some other words in there,

16:57.813 --> 17:15.716
bring your darling little boy to campus, open the 
car doors, put his baggage out, put him on the curb,

16:57.813 --> 17:15.716
kiss him goodbye, get back in your car, and leave 
him in our tender mercies. And Mr. and Mrs. Lane did

17:17.138 --> 17:19.281
that. and we were left standing there, and we knew 
where our dorm was, which was Walton Hall, and we

17:20.172 --> 17:32.350
wandered over there, I guess, and immediately we 
were in the tender mercies of the sophomores and

17:20.172 --> 17:32.350
juniors. But I came to A&M with my best friend, 
which was a big asset, because there was a little

17:34.474 --> 17:42.125
touch of home there, and it made it easier. Had you 
visited the campus before that? Oh, yes. Sorry.

17:46.868 --> 17:48.129
Well, yes. First time I visited campus, 1936, my 
father brought me over from Lufkin, Texas to a

17:48.770 --> 18:03.024
football game in which Dick Todd was a sophomore 
for A&M and playing against Sammy Ball, who was a

17:48.770 --> 18:03.024
senior at TCU. A&M won that game, but next year got 
clobbered real bad. No, two years later got

18:08.409 --> 18:11.252
clobbered real bad, but that was the first time. 
Then my brother came. his freshman year, and he

18:12.856 --> 18:20.228
lived in the corner ramp of Puryear Hall, no longer 
existing. And we drove up and parked there on that

18:21.189 --> 18:25.596
street that was in front of Puryear Hall. And I went 
in, and all of these people started introducing

18:26.457 --> 18:32.006
themselves to me. I was a 12-year-old. I'm Fish 
so-and-so. I'm Fish Gillis. My brother's

18:35.732 --> 18:37.295
roommate was Tom Gillis. And I'm Fish Gillis. I'm 
Fish so-and-so. And I went back out of the car and

18:41.088 --> 18:45.513
said, Mom, what kind of place is this? Everybody 
here is named Fish. But that was 1938. But I was

18:49.517 --> 19:00.288
taken in, and I go to football games with my 
brother, Stan, with the Corps of Cadets, and Saul

18:49.517 --> 19:00.288
washed his hands off, and I got totally, 
completely brainwashed. And this is what I

19:01.249 --> 19:05.053
wanted, to be part of the brotherhood. 
fellowship.

19:10.048 --> 19:12.191
So you arrived that summer. You already knew what 
dorm you were going to be. Describe how you and this

19:15.576 --> 19:25.008
friend, how did you all get blended into that dorm 
and into that outfit? What outfit were you in? I was

19:26.510 --> 19:27.992
in A battery field artillery. The battery 
commander was named Builderback. There were two

19:30.656 --> 19:31.597
Builderbacks. One was the track man. This was not 
the track man. He was the veterinarian student,

19:34.042 --> 19:37.567
and the executive officer of the battery was Mr. 
Spear. We had a fellow from down in Duval County

19:39.049 --> 19:45.538
named Parr, which we had a nickname for. I better 
not use it here, but it has to do with a part of the

19:45.578 --> 19:54.110
sexual and alliteration organs. But he was a 
sophomore, and he was a kind of a mean one. The later

19:59.641 --> 20:05.187
I called on our battery commander, who's now a 
veterinarian, but he's paraplegic. And I went to

20:05.947 --> 20:08.710
San Antonio to see if we bought him one time, and 
looked him up. And I asked him, I said, how did we end

20:08.750 --> 20:12.694
up at being your room art lease? He said, I've 
selected you as your roommate. And so we were his

20:16.178 --> 20:23.425
room art lease, which was a big, big, big asset. I 
mean, Mr. Park came to us and told us to do

20:23.445 --> 20:26.028
something. Sorry, sir, I'm on detail from Mr. 
Builder back. And he was a kind of a protector,

20:28.970 --> 20:35.016
being room orderly to him. I like to talk about room 
orderly business sometimes. I do. And it was,

20:39.080 --> 20:42.844
several things happened. Number one, we were 
there. I like to talk, why did I come to A&M? I came to

20:48.530 --> 20:54.336
A&M as I guess an anthropologist would call it a 
rite of passage. to see if I could take it. I knew

20:56.399 --> 20:57.925
what A&M was. My brothers had been here. I knew 
about the hazing. I wanted the hazing. I wanted it.

21:03.042 --> 21:03.744
I wanted that year. Just test my mettle. I

21:05.757 --> 21:14.888
figured that doing it remotely for one year and 
getting it for three years was a pretty good deal.

21:15.749 --> 21:16.910
But there were things that happened. My father 
broke a relationship with a man. Maybe you don't

21:19.774 --> 21:22.377
want to use the name because he's a local fellow 
here. He probably has relatives here, but I will

21:22.878 --> 21:25.281
name him. You can cut it out later if you want to. 
Captain Joe Falk was a tech officer here. Joe Falk

21:31.688 --> 21:34.752
was a friend of my father's from CCC days. And he 
came to my father and says, Herman, get Robert to

21:35.221 --> 21:45.569
tell you what's going on in the outfit, and we'll 
get rid of those upperclassmen who were having to

21:35.221 --> 21:45.569
perform with Marguerite. My father never spoke to 
him again in his life. And they called Captain Hank

21:48.918 --> 21:51.745
up. hiding. A freshman lifted the lid of a garbage 
can. There was a captain in there trying to find

21:56.414 --> 21:59.778
him. It just was ridiculous. Most of us were 
getting a little fine and didn't want to do it. I'll

22:06.566 --> 22:07.107
go back. I'm talking here. They gave us that letter 
and told us to leave. Everybody did that except one

22:11.853 --> 22:15.757
set of parents. I'll name his name. His name was 
Fish Helbig. He ended up in my outfit. And his

22:21.796 --> 22:34.069
parents stood in line, all these long lines, to 
register and get, you know, do all of that, and

22:21.796 --> 22:34.069
stood out like a sore thumb, because there were 
other parents that just dropped us off and gone

22:21.796 --> 22:34.069
home. Well, Fish Hellwick was in and out, but he got 
hazed a lot more than I did, because, as I said, I'm a

22:34.089 --> 22:42.318
good, compliant boy, and I had nobody. But he got 
hazed, and he wrote along and told his parents

22:43.099 --> 22:51.668
about it, how they were getting him up and doing 
everything, and do sit-ups and push-ups and so

22:43.099 --> 22:51.668
forth at 2 o'clock in the morning, And his mother 
sent a letter to some administrator at A&M. And

22:58.426 --> 23:01.029
then all of a sudden we had a big battery meeting. 
And so and so and so and so and so and so had been

23:02.071 --> 23:08.919
dismissed from the Corps and had to be day dodgers 
now. And it was a real, real cold. I mean, it was the

23:11.982 --> 23:14.405
first time I'd ever been in a meeting like that. 
Very somber. Now, did those activities that today

23:21.247 --> 23:25.312
we'd call hazing, did that begin almost 
immediately? Immediately. Immediately. How

23:27.615 --> 23:29.478
long was it before classes began? After you 
arrived? Very quickly. During the summer, since

23:36.387 --> 23:46.980
this was three semesters year-round, was that 
summer semester Monday, Wednesday, Friday,

23:36.387 --> 23:46.980
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday classes? Yes, it was 
when I came back. Until 49. About how many hours did

23:50.299 --> 23:55.204
you take that first semester? I think I took 17 
hours. And what was your major at that time? At that

23:58.448 --> 24:00.810
time, it was civil engineering. Go back. Why did 
you pick that? When I finished high school, if you

24:03.854 --> 24:07.738
had asked me, what is your ambition? And if I'd been 
honest, though most high school students, it's

24:09.239 --> 24:15.486
harder than being absolutely honest. I always 
said my ambition is to be a Texas Aggie. My

24:18.656 --> 24:20.418
immediate ambition is to be a Texas Aggie. Well, to 
go to A&M,

24:21.659 --> 24:32.732
I knew with my interest and aptitude that I should 
go to that school 90 miles west of here. I knew I

24:33.813 --> 24:42.964
loved words, I loved reading, I loved literature, 
I loved history, but I'd rather have been dead than

24:33.813 --> 24:42.964
go to that school. So I wanted to be a Texas Aggie. 
And if you go to A&M, well, you should. really ought

24:46.668 --> 24:52.353
to major something he was fairly good at, 
engineering, agriculture, something like that.

24:52.373 --> 24:54.715
Which, okay, which is the broadest of the 
engineering? Civil engineering. So I'll go and

24:57.077 --> 24:59.859
major in civil engineering. And I got here and pick 
up my, all my books and I get my history book and read

24:59.879 --> 25:09.167
it, all of it, all the way through the first two 
books. About a minute later I said, this is

25:09.908 --> 25:11.930
ridiculous. I can do this engineering, but yuck. I 
don't like it. Not interesting. You spend too much

25:18.846 --> 25:23.712
time in labs for the credits you get. I mean, I go 
three hours to history class and English class and

25:23.772 --> 25:28.077
get three hours of credit. I go to three hours of 
chemistry and then four hours of lab and get four

25:28.117 --> 25:32.122
hours of credit. That's a bump, you know. But I like 
the history, so I said, I don't care if any of them is

25:35.927 --> 25:41.454
good in history or not good in history. I'm going to 
major in history. And what did you think you were

25:43.437 --> 25:46.020
going to do with that history degree? At the first, 
I thought I probably would have to teach history.

25:51.342 --> 25:58.792
And then, while I was here, it came back from the 
Marines, one or much other. Now, go back to about

25:59.593 --> 26:08.386
fourth grade, when I was in Texas one time, I 
remember these things. A teacher came in and said,

26:08.406 --> 26:10.489
what's your ambition? My father, whom I loved and 
admired, was a wonderful man, was a captain of the

26:11.279 --> 26:22.553
reserves, but I could tell around the table he 
could be relieved from active duty at any time, and

26:11.279 --> 26:22.553
we were back on the farm. We had nothing. And by 
their conversation, I knew that they really

26:24.856 --> 26:30.943
envied the people who had the security of a regular 
Army commission. And so I wanted to be like him, a

26:33.006 --> 26:38.012
captain, but I wanted to be a captain, one step up, a 
regular Army. I said, I want to be a captain of the

26:38.735 --> 26:40.177
regular army. She really got on me. She said, why do 
you want to be such a bum? I mean, she really rented

26:43.361 --> 26:44.422
out. She had cancer somewhere or something, a 
piece of it. And she said that. So one of my things

26:48.947 --> 26:51.551
was captain of the regular army. I dreamt of having 
a regular army commission. The only other school I

26:53.733 --> 26:57.798
thought about at the first point, even remotely. 
That first semester, did you have some, do you

26:57.818 --> 27:05.147
remember some of the teachers, courses, et cetera 
you had that first semester? Were some of those

27:06.528 --> 27:10.113
important to you in the long run that you now 
realize? Only Dr. Chemistry later present me and

27:10.253 --> 27:16.742
him. Harrington? Harrington. He was a wonderful 
friend of the cadets. Describe him as a teacher.

27:26.095 --> 27:30.901
Just, to me, just easygoing and understanding and 
fun. But one thing I do remember that We sat in that

27:36.548 --> 27:42.154
chemistry building, and I did not know that I was 
nearsighted. And they set us by alphabetical

27:42.835 --> 27:44.597
order. And I ended up at the back of the chemistry 
building, of the chemistry lecture room. And I

27:50.464 --> 27:54.148
could not see what he was writing on the 
blackboard. And I never did learn to do balance

27:54.328 --> 27:59.794
equations in chemistry. But I managed to get by 
with a C somehow. But let me see.

28:08.273 --> 28:10.976
Later on, when I came back, I remember them much 
better. But I don't remember that. In fact, my

28:14.680 --> 28:24.369
mind, since I was going and going to Marines, my 
freshman grades don't show very good at all. But

28:25.210 --> 28:26.432
you passed everything. I passed everything. In 
fact, my weapon of great point went down from high

28:27.653 --> 28:33.659
school, as did all the Thomas Jefferson people. My 
grade points... One up, rather, from what we've

28:35.847 --> 28:39.072
done in high school. And Jefferson was a great high 
school at that time. Absolutely fabulous. About

28:42.798 --> 28:44.300
how many in your senior class? At Jefferson, 555 
graduated. 555. Yeah. And they had two

28:48.486 --> 28:51.892
graduations a year. Describe, beginning that 
summer, describe a typical class day for an Aggie

28:52.452 --> 29:03.289
Fish in the summer of 44, is that right? Summer of 
44. What time did y'all get up? What did you do when?

29:08.512 --> 29:12.237
Get up around, I assume, six o'clock. Clean up our 
room.

29:19.668 --> 29:22.452
We're done cleaning up the upper-classes room at 
that time. Fall out for formation. And you'd fall

29:24.915 --> 29:26.998
out where? It depends on which dorm we were in. If we 
were in what we called the new area, the first time

29:29.337 --> 29:38.368
we'd fall out in front of Walton Hall and march to 
Sevesa.

29:40.290 --> 29:43.193
Then we'd eat and table service. A lot of guys were 
working their way through A&M simply by waiting on

29:44.915 --> 29:55.247
tables in the dining halls and get through. and 
give all the good stuff, meal service to the

29:56.020 --> 30:00.826
upperclassmen. They got first, pretty much first 
pick. And use all this language and learn that

30:04.931 --> 30:07.515
stuff. And

30:08.396 --> 30:14.884
I don't remember eating at a brace that we may have, 
but I don't remember doing it. And

30:15.965 --> 30:25.858
going back and cleaning up, making sure our room 
was spotless, and the upperclassmen room was

30:15.965 --> 30:25.858
spotless, Mr. Bailback, Mr. Spears room was 
spotless. empty their garbage and all that good

30:26.463 --> 30:28.787
stuff. Then at 8 o'clock, go to our first class. 
Then about 9 o'clock, generally speaking in the

30:33.334 --> 30:40.586
morning, go across the railroad tracks. We had PE 
three times a week.

30:48.399 --> 30:50.142
It was more like basic training. As I said in a, 
talking to kids from Muster when we had our 50th

30:50.830 --> 31:03.782
anniversary class, I said in one quarter basic 
training in three quarters academic

30:50.830 --> 31:03.782
institution. There was survival at sea and PE when 
your ship, not if your ship got sunk, but when your

31:04.823 --> 31:12.851
ship got sunk. How to make a flotation device out of 
your trousers. Mr. Art Adamson did that. Then we'd

31:21.222 --> 31:27.025
go over to the Tender Mercies of Mr. Penberthy and 
Mr. Putnam. And that was the other time.
