WEBVTT

00:03.187 --> 00:04.008
picture show.

00:06.692 --> 00:09.015
And then after that, would you go get a Coke somewhere?

00:10.477 --> 00:10.858
I did.

00:10.878 --> 00:13.201
I'd go down to Northgate and get an ice cream.

00:13.521 --> 00:19.830
And you must weigh about now what you weighed then?

00:20.090 --> 00:20.471
No, sir.

00:20.811 --> 00:20.931
Oh.

00:22.193 --> 00:25.257
When I finished high school, I weighed 120 pounds.

00:25.518 --> 00:26.940
Oh, boy.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.722
When I went to A&M, I weighed about

00:30.102 --> 00:31.003
130.

00:31.744 --> 00:35.228
After my freshman year, I got up to 140.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.872
And that's about all I waited until I went into service.

00:43.557 --> 00:44.838
Let's see.

00:46.140 --> 00:50.304
You go on active duty in the spring of 42.

00:52.367 --> 00:57.352
As you were getting ready to go, what arrangements did you make?

00:57.432 --> 00:59.755
Did you send some things home?

00:59.903 --> 01:02.329
Didn't even get to see my family.

01:02.811 --> 01:03.252
Oh, my.

01:04.656 --> 01:11.594
I didn't, I guess, talked to my brother in Houston and told him I was fixing to go overseas, and he said, son, you're crazy.

01:11.634 --> 01:13.218
You're not going overseas this quick.

01:13.238 --> 01:14.462
You just went into Cyrus.

01:14.482 --> 01:15.043
I said, well...

01:16.475 --> 01:25.364
can be a fellow by the class ahead of me in the class of forty, Brian Mitchell, went in the same time I did, and he had a car.

01:26.045 --> 01:33.093
And I said, can I bring Lieutenant Mitchell's car to Houston and you store it till he can get it back home?

01:33.213 --> 01:33.954
He said yes.

01:34.494 --> 01:35.655
And he brought me to Houston.

01:35.735 --> 01:39.660
I told my brother goodbye, and I didn't get to go see my mother, my daddy, anybody.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.942
Now, you had not yet graduated.

01:42.142 --> 01:42.462
Yes.

01:43.584 --> 01:44.485
I had graduated.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.368
They gave me the last six weeks.

01:47.388 --> 01:49.651
My brother went through and got my diploma.

01:50.232 --> 01:55.659
I left April the 10th, and the graduation wasn't until May.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.903
My brother went through and got my diploma at A&M.

01:59.003 --> 01:59.323
I didn't.

02:00.725 --> 02:06.512
And that reminds me of one to mention.

02:09.462 --> 02:18.150
the fellow that ran the Cadillac Bar in Nueva Lareda all those years, Porter.

02:18.410 --> 02:19.111
Porter Garner.

02:19.131 --> 02:19.732
Porter Garner.

02:19.972 --> 02:24.196
He told me that his group, they went on active duty.

02:24.336 --> 02:38.389
They were six hours short of being seniors and that they were allowed to get their senior rings six hours short, that they were about the only group he'd ever heard of.

02:38.892 --> 02:44.181
that were allowed to do that because they got called to active duty.

02:45.764 --> 02:51.133
So you went from College Station then to active duty.

02:51.954 --> 02:58.926
Did you send some stuff home or did you take what little you had with you?

03:01.336 --> 03:02.778
I guess I sent it home.

03:02.898 --> 03:03.339
I don't know.

03:03.419 --> 03:03.960
I don't remember.

03:03.980 --> 03:05.282
That's too long ago.

03:05.302 --> 03:07.546
All right.

03:07.566 --> 03:11.512
Let's see more about life at A&M in those days.

03:11.913 --> 03:14.898
Did many students smoke then?

03:16.580 --> 03:20.847
Oh, there were several, but I wouldn't say many.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.237
And was it cigarettes?

03:23.757 --> 03:25.819
Well, most pipes and then there was cigarettes.

03:25.879 --> 03:26.800
Pipes, okay.

03:28.282 --> 03:29.843
Snuff or chewing tobacco?

03:29.863 --> 03:32.526
I never noticed them guys dipping snuff.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.988
A few chewed tobacco, not many.

03:34.068 --> 03:35.049
What about cigars?

03:35.890 --> 03:37.651
A few smoked cigars, not many.

03:38.612 --> 03:41.676
Did you and your buddies even know the word marijuana?

03:42.196 --> 03:42.376
No.

03:43.197 --> 03:43.798
Or heroin?

03:44.198 --> 03:44.398
No.

03:46.380 --> 03:50.985
How often did some student have any alcohol in his room?

03:55.859 --> 03:56.820
I don't know of any.

03:56.860 --> 03:59.484
I'm sure there was, but I didn't know of any.

03:59.844 --> 04:02.107
Did you and your buddies know about the steam tunnels?

04:03.569 --> 04:04.090
No.

04:04.110 --> 04:16.206
Because later there would be kids would get down in the... I didn't even know there was that until I got a friend from Mr. Forsyte and he helped put them in and told me about them.

04:17.788 --> 04:20.171
Did you ever go to a commencement?

04:20.912 --> 04:20.972
No.

04:21.104 --> 04:23.868
You didn't get to go to the one where you graduated.

04:24.309 --> 04:27.114
Did you go to the commencement earlier than then?

04:27.154 --> 04:28.436
No, sir.

04:29.177 --> 04:31.681
But you did go to final review your fourth year.

04:33.384 --> 04:34.165
I wasn't in it.

04:34.686 --> 04:35.367
Your fourth year?

04:35.728 --> 04:36.589
Oh, no, that's right.

04:36.869 --> 04:37.290
Oh.

04:37.760 --> 04:42.945
So you never got to wear your senior boots at a final review?

04:42.985 --> 04:43.886
No, sir.

04:43.906 --> 04:44.347
My, my.

04:45.248 --> 04:45.368
Oh.

04:46.389 --> 04:53.837
And because I was going to ask, did anyone from home come, your parents or anything?

04:54.458 --> 04:57.100
So nobody got to come to that.

04:58.141 --> 04:59.182
Let's see, muster.

04:59.903 --> 05:02.586
Do you remember going to muster as a student?

05:04.523 --> 05:05.124
No, sir.

05:06.105 --> 05:10.651
All right, I haven't run into many people who remember muster before the war.

05:11.052 --> 05:12.634
No, sir, I don't remember the war.

05:12.654 --> 05:19.624
I believe that World War II made muster far more important than it had been.

05:20.425 --> 05:23.649
First muster I went to was in Angelo, Italy.

05:23.669 --> 05:24.851
Oh, describe that.

05:26.914 --> 05:29.217
Please, just describe.

05:29.478 --> 05:32.742
Well, we killed a goat and we barbecued a goat.

05:33.565 --> 05:36.088
And it was on April 21.

05:36.208 --> 05:37.049
Yes, sir.

05:37.069 --> 05:38.370
About how many people were there?

05:40.072 --> 05:40.733
About 12.

05:41.594 --> 05:42.415
And y'all Aggies?

05:42.635 --> 05:43.516
Yes, sir.

05:43.536 --> 05:48.862
What did y'all, other than to eat the goat, what did y'all do as a part of that muster?

05:51.005 --> 05:51.946
To tell stories?

05:52.286 --> 05:54.128
Oh, well, glad to see one another.

05:55.930 --> 05:59.134
And do you remember who thought of the idea?

06:00.228 --> 06:00.689
No, sir.

06:01.271 --> 06:02.193
Of doing it.

06:02.574 --> 06:04.098
You were with what outfit then?

06:04.118 --> 06:09.812
I was with 106th and the aircraft battalion, separate battalion.

06:10.413 --> 06:14.423
And we stayed in a separate battalion all the way through World War II.

06:14.804 --> 06:17.511
We would be attached to one outfit and then another.

06:18.993 --> 06:21.957
Were you all attached to the 36th Division?

06:21.977 --> 06:22.878
For a short time.

06:23.519 --> 06:26.122
I was with them when they got the fire knocked out of them.

06:27.063 --> 06:31.389
That's what made me think of it because they were in some of the toughest action.

06:31.469 --> 06:33.372
Well, we tried to tell them they wouldn't listen.

06:36.055 --> 06:37.917
Did you go in at Salerno also?

06:38.038 --> 06:39.560
Yes, sir.

06:39.580 --> 06:41.843
Oh, tough, tough.

06:41.863 --> 06:42.744
Tough, tough.

06:42.764 --> 06:44.045
I made 70 days.

06:44.746 --> 06:45.367
My, my.

06:46.028 --> 06:47.650
Where were the others?

06:48.018 --> 07:00.561
Well, North Africa, Sicily, Tunisia, and then southern France, and then into Germany.

07:01.703 --> 07:04.488
There's seven of them.

07:04.748 --> 07:05.790
Which was the toughest?

07:07.913 --> 07:12.640
I'd say Angelo was the toughest.

07:13.342 --> 07:17.889
How did your A&M experience prepare you for World War II?

07:19.311 --> 07:25.581
What did you learn at A&M that helped?

07:25.601 --> 07:33.253
Well, they taught us to be officers and we had to pay the part of officers in the war.

07:34.955 --> 07:35.997
We had to take care of

07:36.517 --> 07:42.026
Like when I was in the company, we had about a hundred and ten men in the company.

07:42.126 --> 07:44.571
I had to take care of those hundred and ten men.

07:45.472 --> 07:50.200
Did your A&M experience teach you anything about working together, team play?

07:50.561 --> 07:50.901
Oh, yeah.

07:53.926 --> 07:59.115
What do you think were the key elements of being a good officer?

08:06.233 --> 08:12.182
Put yourself in the same place as you, your men in the same place that you are.

08:12.243 --> 08:15.488
In other words, don't ask them to do something that you wouldn't do.

08:17.190 --> 08:18.192
That was my theory.

08:19.594 --> 08:25.143
I didn't ask anybody to do anything that I wouldn't do myself.

08:30.071 --> 08:31.954
What creates Aggie's spirit?

08:34.600 --> 08:36.322
Why are Aggies so proud?

08:41.190 --> 08:41.730
I don't know.

08:41.750 --> 08:43.553
It just seemed like it was born to me.

08:44.815 --> 08:48.260
Are there some events that helped to pull Aggies together?

08:49.862 --> 08:50.343
Oh, yeah.

08:51.384 --> 08:58.314
There's things that happened.

08:58.334 --> 09:03.662
It just goes to show you just like this year, this last year in the bonfire, that

09:04.098 --> 09:05.700
that pulled everybody together.

09:07.501 --> 09:14.068
I've wondered, does muster and yell practice and football games?

09:14.569 --> 09:15.630
Well, muster does.

09:15.710 --> 09:16.711
Muster brings a lot.

09:19.254 --> 09:24.319
The midnight yell practice, it helps some, but there's a lot of now.

09:24.739 --> 09:29.224
When you get my age, you don't go to a midnight yell practice.

09:29.244 --> 09:32.367
No, but I was meaning as you grow up.

09:32.347 --> 09:34.630
But must have brings a lot of people together.

09:34.971 --> 09:36.032
Class reunions.

09:37.574 --> 09:39.237
Silver taps while you're a student.

09:39.357 --> 09:41.059
Yes, sir.

09:41.360 --> 09:42.101
Those rings.

09:43.943 --> 09:45.425
And the boots.

09:46.126 --> 09:51.694
Of course, the boots don't play that big a part more than that many of them.

09:55.279 --> 10:00.987
As you look back, what kind of difference did it make in your life that you went to A&M?

10:04.190 --> 10:08.798
It learned me to take orders.

10:09.018 --> 10:12.705
I was the youngest of five children.

10:13.806 --> 10:14.688
And I was a baby.

10:15.169 --> 10:17.493
And I had high temper.

10:17.513 --> 10:20.838
And it took a lot of that out of me.

10:22.942 --> 10:24.665
Did it also teach you how to lead?

10:24.725 --> 10:25.827
Yes, sir.

10:26.684 --> 10:30.930
Now, you already knew how to work hard, so it didn't teach you.

10:31.191 --> 10:32.433
You didn't have to learn that.

10:33.935 --> 10:37.460
Did it help you learn to work with different kinds of people?

10:39.804 --> 10:40.245
Yes, sir.

10:44.912 --> 10:45.693
I think it did.

10:48.998 --> 10:54.987
Are there some people that you met at A&M that have been very important in your life?

10:57.751 --> 10:59.994
Well, in later life, yes.

11:00.014 --> 11:05.242
I'm very, you probably know I'm connected with the athletic department quite a bit.

11:05.482 --> 11:05.903
Yes, sir.

11:05.923 --> 11:07.665
I think a lot of John David Crowe.

11:10.550 --> 11:10.690
Mm-hmm.

11:10.710 --> 11:12.472
And Wally Groff.

11:13.794 --> 11:13.934
Mm-hmm.

11:13.954 --> 11:15.677
And then R.C.

11:15.697 --> 11:18.060
Slocum, I like R.C.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.102
Slocum very much.

11:19.783 --> 11:22.327
We both went to the same high school.

11:22.447 --> 11:23.128
Did you?

11:23.488 --> 11:26.813
He was an orange tiger about 10 years after I was.

11:27.130 --> 11:35.510
My high school coach was Brooks Conover, who was, I think, class of 33 at A&M.

11:36.873 --> 11:43.468
He later moved back up to Cleburne, but he was my high school coach.

11:43.769 --> 11:53.481
See, during the war, as you might remember, a whole bunch of people moved to boom towns, and Orange had three big shipyards.

11:54.002 --> 12:00.169
My father went there to work in the shipyard, and I think that's why he ended up there also.

12:01.050 --> 12:10.502
We moved from Garland up near Dallas, and we thought when we got up to Kirbyville or Jasper, we were way up in the woods.

12:10.482 --> 12:11.243
You were.

12:12.105 --> 12:16.933
And I went to scout camp at Camp Bill Stark on Cow Creek.

12:18.436 --> 12:21.942
My wife's father had a camp just a little further down.

12:22.203 --> 12:22.724
Oh, really?

12:23.365 --> 12:23.705
Yes.

12:23.726 --> 12:23.826
Okay.

12:24.407 --> 12:29.997
I broke my arm one year there, and we went into Kirbyville on Saturday night.

12:30.117 --> 12:34.144
My parents picked me up, and we could find only one doctor.

12:34.529 --> 12:36.051
Dr. McCrite.

12:36.071 --> 12:42.261
And he suggested that we go on back to Orange, that I could make the trip well.

12:43.362 --> 12:47.709
But that's one of my memories of Kirbyville.

12:48.290 --> 12:48.690
R.C.

12:48.810 --> 12:56.902
and his two sons, they come to my farm out of Brenham and fish all the time.

12:56.922 --> 13:00.528
What are the qualities, what are the key ingredients of being an Aggie?

13:02.130 --> 13:04.013
What are the characteristics of an Aggie?

13:05.950 --> 13:15.603
Well, you got to like people, for one thing, and you got to be yourself and everybody's equal.

13:19.869 --> 13:20.690
And to be helpful?

13:21.351 --> 13:22.412
Yes, sir, be helpful.

13:25.677 --> 13:27.199
Can't be self-centered.

13:30.672 --> 13:35.099
Well, I don't have but three or four questions left.

13:35.159 --> 13:37.493
What have we not covered that we should have?

13:40.392 --> 13:51.367
Oh, were there ever any times when you had a problem at A&M that somebody helped you that really made a difference?

13:51.387 --> 13:53.250
No, sir.

13:53.270 --> 13:54.732
So you didn't go broke.

13:54.772 --> 13:56.354
You didn't have to go borrow money.

13:56.454 --> 13:56.935
No, sir.

13:56.955 --> 13:59.478
Other than your broken jaw, you didn't have any injuries.

14:01.301 --> 14:01.921
No, sir.

14:01.941 --> 14:05.066
You weren't about to flunk out or get kicked out.

14:05.086 --> 14:05.606
No, sir.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.129
I never was on probation.

14:07.289 --> 14:08.510
Never was on probation.

14:08.871 --> 14:08.931
No.

14:08.911 --> 14:19.531
Do you have any, if you had all the A&M teachers here in the room that you had, are there any of them you would especially want to thank?

14:21.534 --> 14:23.478
Yes.

14:23.839 --> 14:24.841
Who would they be?

14:24.901 --> 14:26.704
I can't think of his name right now.

14:26.724 --> 14:27.586
It's too long ago.

14:28.147 --> 14:31.493
That was a fellow in mechanical drawing.

14:36.181 --> 14:37.522
Randall.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.965
Oh, Cliff Randall.

14:40.406 --> 14:40.926
Randall?

14:41.207 --> 14:41.607
Randall.

14:42.268 --> 14:42.728
Randall.

14:42.928 --> 14:44.670
How did he help you?

14:45.311 --> 14:48.915
Well, he tutored me after class.

14:48.935 --> 14:54.481
Because you hadn't had much drawing, I'll bet, in Kirbyville High School.

14:56.564 --> 14:56.764
No.

14:56.924 --> 14:58.746
Now, how old were you when you got there?

14:59.587 --> 15:00.228
When I got there.

15:00.828 --> 15:02.130
Well, I was 18.

15:02.290 --> 15:05.975
See, I finished high school in 16.

15:06.275 --> 15:10.860
And I was two years out of high school before I went to college.

15:11.782 --> 15:15.506
Now, were you a year or so older than the average fish?

15:15.666 --> 15:16.007
No, sir.

15:16.287 --> 15:18.189
Oh, there were a number of other 18-year-olds?

15:18.249 --> 15:21.113
Because I finished high school when I was barely 16.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.897
Were there any Latin American Aggies?

15:25.218 --> 15:26.339
Any Mexican American?

15:26.359 --> 15:27.180
Not many.

15:27.160 --> 15:27.921
Not many.

15:28.502 --> 15:28.882
A few.

15:30.724 --> 15:32.706
And you said there were some Jewish boys.

15:34.408 --> 15:36.551
Were there any international Aggies?

15:37.112 --> 15:39.915
Oh, we had a boy in our outfit from the Philippine Islands.

15:41.156 --> 15:42.137
Did he have a nickname?

15:46.763 --> 15:48.285
Palanibal was his name.

15:48.305 --> 15:48.945
Palanibal?

15:50.127 --> 15:51.869
What we called him.

15:51.889 --> 15:54.432
Do you have any idea why he was at A&M?

15:54.512 --> 15:55.513
What led him to be...

15:57.805 --> 15:59.667
Let's see.

16:00.187 --> 16:02.789
You must have known John Kimbrough.

16:03.370 --> 16:03.790
Oh, yeah.

16:04.010 --> 16:05.291
What was he like as a person?

16:06.572 --> 16:08.134
John's a hard person to know.

16:08.154 --> 16:08.674
Is that right?

16:09.255 --> 16:09.815
Was he then?

16:10.236 --> 16:11.277
Yes, sir.

16:11.297 --> 16:12.017
Was he shy?

16:12.758 --> 16:18.002
No, not necessarily shy, but he just, well, I shouldn't say this.

16:18.783 --> 16:20.845
He just wasn't the friendliest person in the world.

16:20.865 --> 16:21.105
Okay.

16:21.565 --> 16:22.666
What about Marion Pugh?

16:22.926 --> 16:24.808
Marion Pugh was very friendly.

16:24.828 --> 16:27.070
Now, why was he nicknamed Dookie?

16:27.252 --> 16:27.933
I don't know.

16:28.854 --> 16:30.657
Because he was well liked, wasn't he?

16:30.737 --> 16:31.077
Yes, sir.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.701
Yes, sir.

16:33.721 --> 16:41.492
Who was the, was he the key, he was the quarterback, was he the one that made that Aggie team work together?

16:42.113 --> 16:42.994
Who was the key?

16:44.356 --> 16:46.279
Well, I don't know about that.

16:46.379 --> 16:47.661
I wouldn't think so.

16:49.103 --> 16:53.549
Of course, you know, Price was the quarterback the year we won the national championship.

16:53.569 --> 16:54.911
He was a substitute.

16:54.931 --> 16:55.572
Oh, okay.

16:56.328 --> 16:57.189
Okay.

16:57.209 --> 17:01.795
Then Pugh was the quarterback the next year, and we lost the last game to Texas.

17:02.656 --> 17:03.698
Did you go to that game?

17:03.758 --> 17:04.799
Yes, sir.

17:04.819 --> 17:06.181
Describe your feelings.

17:07.102 --> 17:11.427
Well, that was one of the few games I carried a date to, and I was all upset.

17:13.770 --> 17:16.574
Ever played in Austin.

17:16.594 --> 17:19.258
Because you all were dreaming about going to the Rose Bowl.

17:19.538 --> 17:19.618
Yep.

17:21.320 --> 17:26.066
And so what was it like coming home, coming back from that game?

17:26.586 --> 17:31.472
Wasn't much talking.

17:31.492 --> 17:38.320
But now the previous year when won the national championship, how much did y'all celebrate?

17:39.081 --> 17:42.585
Well, I didn't get to go to New Orleans.

17:42.605 --> 17:43.507
Oh, you didn't get to go?

17:43.987 --> 17:45.289
I didn't have the money.

17:46.330 --> 17:49.333
But when you beat Texas, y'all must have had a good time.

17:49.434 --> 17:49.774
Yeah.

17:51.458 --> 17:54.442
Let's see.

18:00.991 --> 18:06.258
What has it meant to you in your life that you went to Texas A&M?

18:06.278 --> 18:08.181
What difference has that made in your life?

18:10.044 --> 18:14.229
It taught me how to get along with people.

18:14.650 --> 18:19.677
It helped me in my business to supervise people.

18:23.082 --> 18:41.378
And it has touched your heart, obviously, because there are some of your responses when I can tell in your eyes how proud you are.

18:41.558 --> 18:43.140
How proud are you to be an Aggie?

18:49.526 --> 18:52.228
My wife could explain to you better than I could.

18:57.524 --> 19:00.129
What feelings do you have for A&M today?

19:00.489 --> 19:00.870
A lot.

19:01.632 --> 19:05.098
A lot.

19:05.118 --> 19:13.934
And I hate that it's got to where that everybody that wants to go to A&M can't go.

19:15.718 --> 19:17.541
I think there's a lot of good people.

19:18.601 --> 19:20.283
They would make good Aggies.

19:20.303 --> 19:21.524
They can't get in today.

19:24.387 --> 19:27.551
But should we let it get bigger than it is now?

19:28.292 --> 19:29.833
How big should we let it get?

19:31.615 --> 19:32.096
I don't know.

19:34.158 --> 19:35.720
I don't know.

19:36.461 --> 19:38.903
Of course, you know, I'm back from the old school.

19:39.144 --> 19:41.566
If I was still running, there'd still be all military.

19:43.048 --> 19:44.710
But I know that had to change.

19:45.671 --> 19:47.713
And I don't know...

19:51.119 --> 19:55.149
You know, money controls most everything.

19:55.169 --> 20:01.165
You got to have money to get the good teachers to keep them, and you got to have the facilities.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.195
I don't think it can be much larger.

20:06.258 --> 20:07.120
I agree with you.

20:07.285 --> 20:10.228
You said you've had grandchildren.

20:10.268 --> 20:11.630
Did you have any children went to A&M?

20:11.650 --> 20:14.093
I had one son that finished A&M.

20:14.293 --> 20:18.017
And I've got three grandchildren that's finished.

20:18.037 --> 20:20.480
Any granddaughters in that group?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.302
Yeah, two.

20:23.043 --> 20:26.107
One of them's a medical doctor and the other one's a PhD.

20:26.127 --> 20:29.230
And you're happy that they got to go to A&M?

20:29.390 --> 20:31.092
Oh, yeah, and they're happy with it.

20:31.112 --> 20:32.434
You're happy with co-education?

20:32.634 --> 20:33.535
Yes, sir.

20:33.555 --> 20:36.178
Well, might as well be.

20:38.268 --> 21:03.786
if of all the parts of A&M which ones do you care most about you've been very generous to athletics what else at A&M do the core I don't give more to the core why is the core dear to your heart

21:06.213 --> 21:09.718
I think it teaches a person to be a better person.

21:10.318 --> 21:10.599
Okay.

21:12.561 --> 21:12.822
Okay.

21:15.445 --> 21:16.546
So, last question.

21:16.566 --> 21:18.909
What are your wishes for A&M in the future?

21:22.915 --> 21:27.761
Well, I hope that Boeing gets them in the top ten universities.

21:29.623 --> 21:31.005
I think we belong there.

21:37.921 --> 21:39.174
And I think we'll make it.
