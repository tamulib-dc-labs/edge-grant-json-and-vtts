WEBVTT

00:02.444 --> 00:05.427
First of all, we're testing. One, two, three, 
four. One, two, three, four. Did you get high-tech

00:09.811 --> 00:12.093
equipment than that? Today, I have the pleasure of 
chatting with Dan Fon Steele about his student

00:12.113 --> 00:17.618
days. Dan, to begin with, someone who might listen 
to this tape or read the transcription years from

00:18.759 --> 00:32.012
now might not know your background, describe 
growing up, where, what did your parents do, What

00:32.414 --> 00:34.236
school did you go to? What did you do before you came 
to A&M as a student? I actually was born in

00:37.340 --> 01:00.430
Guadalupe County, Texas, in Marion, Texas, but at 
five we moved over to Bexar County, a place called

00:37.340 --> 01:00.430
Converse, Texas, very close to San Antonio, and I 
grew up on a very small farm, about 130 acres, when I

00:37.340 --> 01:00.430
still can remember switching from horses and 
mules to tractor, and it was very happy to learn how

01:00.798 --> 01:02.680
to drive the tractor. I always said my father, who 
had only about a fourth grade education, was a

01:04.081 --> 01:10.526
great psychologist. He made me feel that to let me 
drive the tractor was about the greatest thing he

01:11.387 --> 01:17.372
could ever do for me. And I begged and pleaded. At 
ten, I was already putting in full days on that

01:19.634 --> 01:26.500
tractor and I could see him laughing in his fist and 
I'd argue. I wouldn't even want to come home for

01:26.520 --> 01:28.141
meals. I loved to drive that tractor. I guess the 
thing that influenced me more than anything else

01:31.223 --> 01:39.814
to come to Texas A&M was the role model I had with the 
county extension agent. A fellow named H.A.

01:43.940 --> 01:46.443
Fitzhugh was a young county agent out of A&M. He 
just fit my model of everything what a good man

01:47.004 --> 01:56.736
should be and these were the depression days and he 
really, really helped our family. The extension

01:56.777 --> 01:58.699
service really helped our family. We were 
basically a cotton producing farm. With those few

02:04.194 --> 02:07.197
acres, you know, we didn't get rich very easily. Of 
course, as I told my grandsons the other day who did

02:08.039 --> 02:17.911
a similar kind of interview, I said we all were dirt 
poor but we didn't think of ourselves as poor

02:08.039 --> 02:17.911
because everybody else was in the same boat. And 
the Extension Service came out. We were basically

02:20.535 --> 02:28.585
dependent on the cotton crop and we grew some corn 
for feed and some hay and that's about it. The

02:28.987 --> 02:33.912
Extension Service had a program in those days that 
was kind of a part of a national program to

02:28.987 --> 02:33.912
diversify. So we got about 20 milk cows, we got some 
hogs, we got chickens, and that actually pulled us

02:34.893 --> 02:40.698
through. My dad developed an egg and butter route 
in San Antonio where he served rich people. There

02:46.704 --> 02:56.293
were some rich people in the Depression in the 
Alamo Heights area and he'd give them the highest

02:46.704 --> 02:56.293
quality butter and eggs and they'd pay double 
prices for them. He went in once a week and

02:56.982 --> 03:00.307
delivered these and I often went with him. That was 
my first urban exposure.

03:05.656 --> 03:12.047
I started with the 4-H program as early as nine 
years old, as soon as I could get in. I had a couple of

03:12.067 --> 03:15.813
sheep projects which didn't turn out too well. 
Then I was lucky to get, I don't know if you've ever

03:16.234 --> 03:21.943
heard of it, the Sears Foundation program. where 
they gave kids, on the basis of an essay they wrote,

03:22.514 --> 03:28.744
how they would handle this situation, would give 
them pigs. The program was that there were eight

03:29.645 --> 03:49.095
gilts, females, young females, and one boar given 
out each year, and the idea was that the program

03:29.645 --> 03:49.095
would be self-perpetuating because out of each 
litter the following year, another eight boys

03:29.645 --> 03:49.095
would get it, but one person would get the boar. and 
I got the bore that came from the Texas Air Crosser

03:49.615 --> 04:16.230
Experiment Station here at College Station, 
Texas, a Duroc bore, and that was probably my

03:49.615 --> 04:16.230
ticket to A&M because he started siring champions 
at the, I didn't have them, other people had them,

03:49.615 --> 04:16.230
but he started siring winners at the Houston Life 
Doc Show, about three or four years running. and I

04:16.919 --> 04:34.744
worked very closely with the county agent and that 
in those days the tradition was you'd either a pig

04:16.919 --> 04:34.744
or five dollars for service and after the boar got a 
reputation we couldn't handle all the business. I

04:34.784 --> 04:36.987
mean you can only use a boar so much. And the county 
agent said, you need to double your price to cut

04:37.625 --> 04:40.649
down. Well, that really attracted, you know, they 
said it really had something. So it had, that had a

04:44.295 --> 04:50.484
lot to do, I would not have been able to go to A&M if I 
had not been in the forage program. And it

04:51.045 --> 05:00.438
particularly hit it lucky with this animal who 
lived, I guess the only animal, a pig or a hog that I

04:51.045 --> 05:00.438
ever knew died of old age. He was six years old and he 
weighed 1,100 pounds, if you can imagine that. And

05:05.826 --> 05:06.467
that was in, what we call breeding condition. He 
was not fat. He was 1,100 pounds. But his heart gave

05:10.754 --> 05:12.736
out at six years old. I've read somewhere nobody 
ever knows how old a pig gets because we don't let

05:13.557 --> 05:20.383
them reach maturity and die of old age. But anyway, 
the Extension Service did a lot of other things for

05:21.003 --> 05:25.507
our program. They had mattress programs where 
surplus cotton was used to make homemade

05:25.527 --> 05:30.051
mattresses. They had a lot of programs to preserve 
your own food, have gardens, and all of it. I got

05:36.215 --> 05:48.271
pretty committed to wanting to emulate and get, 
and I thought this was really where you could make a

05:36.215 --> 05:48.271
contribution in the world because I really 
admired the extent of the county agents himself

05:36.215 --> 05:48.271
and the programs they did. But as I said, we were 
extremely poor at that time. We were still renting

05:53.458 --> 06:03.892
our property, which meant we had to give up a third 
every year to the landowner, tried desperately to

05:53.458 --> 06:03.892
want to buy it and couldn't because you had to have a 
down payment. Anyway, There was no way I could have

06:04.902 --> 06:15.838
gone to college

06:04.902 --> 06:15.838
without the 4-H experience and the commitment I 
got through seeing the good work that the

06:04.902 --> 06:15.838
Extension Service did. Then as I went to school, I 
went to a rural school at Converse, Texas. It was a

06:23.029 --> 06:24.531
three-room school. where there were three grades 
grouped together, first, second, and third

06:24.933 --> 06:48.814
grade, and fourth, fifth, and sixth, and seventh 
through the tenth, I guess it was, had an old

06:24.933 --> 06:48.814
disciplinarian German principal who was a 
disciplinarian from the word go, and he taught the

06:24.933 --> 06:48.814
top grades except for English, taught all the 
subjects except for English and the lower grades

06:49.486 --> 06:55.740
that were taught to women that came out of San 
Antonio. Anyway, when it came time to, it did not

06:56.562 --> 07:03.799
have a complete program. When it came time to 
graduate, I had to go a year and a half to San Antonio

07:04.522 --> 07:11.788
to in order to get my degree. And my folks, since I 
was the only son, I had one older sister, I guess my

07:13.150 --> 07:19.875
folks aspired to my taking over the farm someday. 
But I still had this other ambition. And they

07:22.318 --> 07:24.239
really couldn't help me a great deal. But I did have 
considerable savings that I did from my eight

07:24.660 --> 07:30.184
years of 4-H projects and so forth. And I very 
strongly wanted to. to come to Texas A&M because I

07:34.492 --> 07:39.700
thought that was the only route you could become a 
county agent in. My parents were not

07:39.720 --> 07:42.063
unsupportive. They said, why don't you go to 
junior college first and see how you like and

07:42.424 --> 07:46.070
everything. I said, no, I didn't know what I was 
getting into. Nobody else in the community had

07:48.794 --> 07:52.880
ever gone to Texas A&M. If I probably had known at 
that time what I faced, I might have had second

07:53.521 --> 07:57.647
thoughts. But anyway, I guess one of the reasons I 
stuck it out was because it was my decision. You

08:02.482 --> 08:08.067
know, many, many times the first year I was ready to 
quit, but I said, you know, everybody knows. Had

08:08.568 --> 08:11.370
you come to visit before you came up to enroll? 
Never. What I knew was just one or two people I'd run

08:12.511 --> 08:17.956
into that, you know, told us, told me about A&M. I 
got all the literature I could get my hands on. If I

08:20.979 --> 08:24.142
could find somebody I'd talk about it, but I really 
was not prepared. I was extremely naive for... So

08:26.364 --> 08:27.685
this is the fall of In the fall of 45, I made the 
decision to come here and things were, just after

08:28.660 --> 08:35.808
the war, switching here. Describe how you got here 
on that trip and what did you bring in the way of

08:37.230 --> 08:42.756
belongings? At that time, we got very strong 
messages. Do not let your parents bring you, which

08:48.143 --> 08:51.787
is quite at odds. In fact, I looked for this. 
There's a YMCA bulletin, you need to find that,

08:53.509 --> 08:57.013
that had You know, stuff that had the yells, the 
songs, and tips, you know, what to do and what not to

08:57.466 --> 09:03.291
do. And the strongest thing was do not let your 
parents bring you. I guess the notion was if you ran

09:07.955 --> 09:18.525
into what you're going to run into, you'd probably 
come right back home with, you know, come by bus or

09:07.955 --> 09:18.525
come by train and bring one trunk of belongings. 
And I got myself a footlocker from somewhere. I

09:20.947 --> 09:25.411
think when my brother-in-law came back from the 
military, army footlocker, that was it. Bus or

09:26.031 --> 09:26.832
train? I came by bus, Kerrville bus from San 
Antonio. Rode the bus. It took about seven hours.

09:32.518 --> 09:33.680
Where did it let you off? Do you remember? Well, I 
know I had a change in Hearn. Came, I guess, at

09:37.726 --> 09:41.371
Northgate somewhere. I'm not sure. I can't 
remember. And what did you have in that

09:43.114 --> 09:44.736
footlocker? My worldly possessions. No, but like 
there wasn't much clothing out there. No, no. I

09:49.604 --> 09:51.006
expected to get clothing here. That was one of the 
attractions of going to A&M, that they'd furnish

09:51.046 --> 09:53.950
you... I think a couple of uniforms and shoes and 
things like that. I got my basic underwear and I

09:57.959 --> 10:02.365
guess a few books and stuff like that. Describe 
finding your way to whatever dorm you were going to

10:02.405 --> 10:07.911
be in. Well, I remember I came in September of 1945. 
The university had been on a trimester system, as

10:12.537 --> 10:17.943
you may remember. During the war, it was an 
accelerated program and they were just switching

10:18.244 --> 10:22.789
back to the semester program. And I don't know 
where the bus, I think the bus let me off at North

10:23.545 --> 10:27.931
Gate. And there was a place there where there were 
upperclassmen to meet you. And that first

10:33.317 --> 10:40.266
encounter was enough to want to get back on the bus 
and go home because they started screaming and

10:33.317 --> 10:40.266
yelling at you. But they somehow organized us. And 
I was assigned to F Company Infantry in dorm six on

10:43.010 --> 10:49.738
the top floor. In what was then called the New Dorm 
area. The New Dorm. Those were the New Dorms. They

10:54.607 --> 10:57.491
had been built, I guess, in the 30s, right? And you 
know the situation. I was on the top floor, and

10:58.933 --> 11:03.658
surprisingly, you may know this person. My 
roommate was Benton Story. My, my. And I guess

11:08.004 --> 11:18.156
Benton was a godsend to me because I guess the 
furthest I'd ever been from home before that had

11:08.004 --> 11:18.156
been through maybe Dallas, Houston, Corpus 
Christi, never out of state. and I was certainly

11:18.963 --> 11:27.250
naive, but I think Benton was even more naive, and 
he was strictly here for academics. All of the core

11:28.451 --> 11:44.286
bull, as we call it, didn't go over well with him, 
but he tolerated, but I guess I often looked at, you

11:28.451 --> 11:44.286
know, I thought I was having a hard time, but I think 
he was even having a harder time, and that kept me

11:28.451 --> 11:44.286
going, but it was quite a cultural shock. I mean, 
there's no question about it. I mean, the

11:45.727 --> 11:46.928
upperclassmen you know, just screaming at you all 
the time. I went to F Company, which turned out

11:50.634 --> 11:59.948
later to be a company so bad they had to, for hazing 
and so forth, they had to dissolve it. Did it have a

12:00.248 --> 12:01.250
nickname? Not that I can remember, but things got 
so bad. One of the problems with the Corps in those

12:05.777 --> 12:11.746
days was that they had a lot of upperclassmen who 
were supercharged. Do you know that word? They

12:13.248 --> 12:16.273
were, even though they were academically 
qualified, sophomores and juniors. They were

12:18.088 --> 12:27.319
given junior and senior status so they'd be a 
non-commissioned and an officer nucleus to run

12:18.088 --> 12:27.319
the companies. And some of those guys were just a 
year or two older than we were and I think they were

12:27.940 --> 12:38.694
not as mature as they were later on when you had 21 
and 22 year old seniors who had more maturity.

12:38.734 --> 12:40.516
These guys were 17, 18 years old. I was 17, they were 
just not a lot older. But they were extremely

12:43.405 --> 12:48.152
rough, no question about it. And there weren't any 
veterans back yet in the fall of 45? They were

12:51.557 --> 12:54.040
coming, yes, in the classes, they were coming in. 
Oh, really? Yeah, and that was the other shock part

12:54.321 --> 12:58.246
of it because they were in the classes already. 
They had started putting in these temporary

12:58.306 --> 13:06.237
housing right here in the north part, the old 
barracks type of thing, made classrooms out of

12:58.306 --> 13:06.237
them. And most of the classes had about 50% 
veterans already. The other thing that was

13:11.452 --> 13:24.070
different at that time, the philosophy, at least 
in agriculture, I can't speak for the other

13:11.452 --> 13:24.070
colleges, was that they didn't expect you to 
finish then. That they wanted you to get something

13:25.132 --> 13:30.560
practical when you got out, and if you didn't come 
back, you'd have that. So basically, instead of

13:31.000 --> 13:37.830
taking the foundation courses the first year, we 
took all the, what I call, applied courses.

13:38.570 --> 13:40.252
Horticulture, agronomy, animals. We had no 
chemistry or botany, except what we had in high

13:40.352 --> 13:44.858
school. But they gave us all of these courses, 
which were second year courses, as I say, animal

13:44.878 --> 13:58.375
science, agronomy, the basic courses, 
horticulture, entomology, I guess agricultural

13:44.878 --> 13:58.375
economics. All of those courses were taught the 
first year. And then the second year, if they knew

14:01.139 --> 14:08.188
we were going to stay, then we went back and picked 
up the chemistry and the botany and biology, all of

14:01.139 --> 14:08.188
that. Anyway, that made it rough because you were, 
I mean, the courses had been taught with having,

14:09.147 --> 14:15.535
you know, some foundation. Do you remember going 
through a registration? Yes, I remember being

14:20.521 --> 14:27.330
shocked at the tremendous heat down here, 
standing in hours, and it was very disorganized.

14:27.470 --> 14:28.271
Where was it held? Sabisa. In Sabisa. But you had to 
stand outside in lines and you had to get in line for

14:29.433 --> 14:33.017
everything. I mean, every course you signed up 
for, you had a, the professor was sitting there and

14:37.362 --> 14:45.652
You know, he'd say whether he'd take you or not, and 
you had to work out your schedule, and all that was

14:37.362 --> 14:45.652
new to me, and you know, just finding your way 
around was pretty traumatic. But, you know, I

14:46.493 --> 14:49.317
guess we kind of leaned on each other. But it took 
about a full day to register in those days, and I

14:50.218 --> 14:54.664
mean, it was just one line after another. Do you 
remember anyone giving you advice? Was there a

14:57.067 --> 14:58.649
faculty member? Yes, I was, I can't remember the 
gentleman's name, but we were assigned advisors.

15:05.071 --> 15:09.918
I was assigned a professor in agricultural 
engineering, although I was not intending to go in

15:05.071 --> 15:09.918
engineering. I want to say McGuire, but that's not 
true. I didn't work with him very much, but he did

15:13.303 --> 15:18.950
help me, advise me, and he was available to me.

15:22.095 --> 15:32.309
I was very committed to the academic program 
myself, and I guess I felt the core somewhat

15:22.095 --> 15:32.309
interfering with that. What did you think your 
major was going to be? I probably was leaning to

15:35.294 --> 15:53.083
animal science then but we didn't have to commit 
because I was this was just general agriculture

15:35.294 --> 15:53.083
the first two years but I was I guess aiming for 
animal science and thought maybe I'd change later

15:35.294 --> 15:53.083
on but most of my earlier background in 4-H had been 
animal science so of course they called it animal

15:35.294 --> 15:53.083
husbandry in those days got a lot of jokes, you 
know, animal husband type of thing, but that's

15:53.570 --> 15:58.537
what it was called in those days. Describe the 
routine of the sophomores and others in the Corps

15:58.978 --> 16:05.688
kind of get you freshmen into shape. Well, at that 
time, I guess it's pretty well the seniors,

16:06.409 --> 16:20.790
although I presume they gave the orders, were 
pretty aloof from the day-to-day activities, and

16:06.409 --> 16:20.790
to some extent the juniors. The sophomores were 
the bane of our existence they were constantly

16:22.949 --> 16:52.956
screaming at us and as you know in those days you 
were you couldn't hide as a freshman you had a fish

16:22.949 --> 16:52.956
stripe on white stripe on your left collar and a 
short haircut and you you couldn't I mean it was not

16:22.949 --> 16:52.956
just the ones in your unit anywhere on the campus 
you ran into sophomores you had to go through the

16:22.949 --> 16:52.956
routine of introducing yourself and all of that 
and you know having you remember the I guess to this

16:22.949 --> 16:52.956
day I can remember that you could never say no. You 
heard that one over. You would never say no. I don't

17:00.213 --> 17:01.554
know if I can still remember that. You'd have to 
say, sir, I do not know the answer. I hesitate to

17:05.058 --> 17:08.541
articulate for fear of deviating from the two 
paths of rectitude. And it went on and on. But you

17:09.903 --> 17:10.884
couldn't say no. But it was rough. It was really, 
really rough. And they did a lot of paddling. And I

17:17.450 --> 17:20.213
really resented that. I mean, I swore at that point 
I would never paddle when I was an operator, and I

17:23.885 --> 17:25.367
never did. I avoided it. I mean, I was put in 
situation, I just refused to do it. I was so put out

17:29.711 --> 17:33.796
by that type of punishment. But in that particular 
company, and it probably was all around, there was

17:33.816 --> 17:38.981
a lot of hazing, which included paddling. There's 
another reason. I'm Dan today instead of Daniel.

17:42.625 --> 17:45.108
Have you heard about beating off your handle? 
Well, at the end of the year, you're they beat off

17:50.969 --> 18:18.192
your handle which was your name and we anticipated 
that and each it was uh each letter uh fish f i each

17:50.969 --> 18:18.192
letter was paddled and the i's were dotted and the 
e's and l's were looped and it was a lot better to be

17:50.969 --> 18:18.192
dan than daniel because there were a lot of loops 
and dots and that in fact at the end of my freshman

17:50.969 --> 18:18.192
year i was they all the sophomores took a great 
pleasure into eliminating your handle, as they

18:20.045 --> 18:27.994
called it, fish font steel, and I really got beat. 
In fact, to this day, I'm embarrassed For some

18:32.178 --> 18:38.767
reason, the first week I was home, my mother saw my 
rear end when I was sleeping one night, and she just

18:32.178 --> 18:38.767
broke down and cried. I mean, it was black and blue. 
But at least that year was behind me. But the thing

18:43.734 --> 18:47.679
was, even as a sophomore, you could be beaten, but 
not as much. But as I said, when I went on, I resolved

18:47.819 --> 18:53.106
that was just too inhumane. And of course, the 
other bad aspect of the Corps was the lack of sleep.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.678
You were just constantly harassed. You know, 
they'd call you out for midnight this and midnight

19:02.249 --> 19:07.394
that and so forth. And some, you know, you finally 
learn your way how to avoid situations. And one of

19:13.320 --> 19:18.826
the best things to do was to get a job, get away from 
this. And I, you know, and I had to work. I mean, I

19:20.587 --> 19:25.592
kept, I had, you know, several hundred dollars 
saved up. And I kept accurate books, and you'll be

19:25.672 --> 19:31.378
surprised to know that my whole first year 
including everything, tuition, room and board,

19:32.000 --> 19:36.108
the whole works, books and everything cost me 
about $500. And did you, or had you earned... I had

19:39.976 --> 19:41.219
that money available. My parents could not help me 
as such. It turned out later on, you know, they got a

19:44.806 --> 19:49.435
little better off during the war. And of course, as 
my wife and I are very fair-minded with the

19:50.191 --> 19:57.302
children, my sister didn't have the opportunity 
to go to college. So we worked out a deal. The

20:00.026 --> 20:08.099
subsequent summers, I would stay at home and farm, 
and they'd give me room and board, and I'd earn what

20:00.026 --> 20:08.099
a hired man would earn. And that helped take me over 
from year to year. But I worked every month except

20:11.324 --> 20:15.310
the first month that I came here. Somehow or 
another, wherever I could find jobs, I started

20:18.271 --> 20:20.394
out, I think, in the horticulture department. I 
later on worked in the poultry department and

20:20.454 --> 20:23.879
things like that. The money, that was 25 cents an 
hour. Minimum, that's what they paid students in

20:26.483 --> 20:28.686
those days. And it was rough. I guess one thing 
that, well, they had two incentives in those days.

20:38.019 --> 20:39.381
Excuse me. I wonder if I get some water. We're going 
to just stop this? Describe the, physically, the

20:45.659 --> 20:53.028
room and what was in it that you and your fish old 
lady shared. Well, let me get off that, we've left

20:53.228 --> 20:56.793
on another thought, let me finish it. There were 
two big incentives for Corps members to do well

20:58.134 --> 21:08.086
academically and I, to this day, I think it's still 
a good program. At that time, I think it was an old

21:11.731 --> 21:20.684
policy at A&M, if you made an A or B, had an A or B 
average and were in the top quarter of your class,

21:11.731 --> 21:20.684
you didn't have to take finance. And that was a real 
incentive to do well. And I always, I was the type of

21:24.970 --> 21:34.643
student, I loved to, or I preferred to study in 
bursts, you know, an hour or so at a time and I

21:24.970 --> 21:34.643
couldn't, you know, and then I'd want to do 
something else. And that was a big incentive to,

21:35.424 --> 21:37.367
uh, Even if you didn't exempt all of them, if you 
exempted two or three, that gave you more time to

21:38.427 --> 21:46.058
study for the others. And I thought it was a real 
incentive. The other even bigger incentive for

21:47.501 --> 21:53.930
freshmen was that one thing that the core did was 
good about the core. I think, particularly for

21:54.591 --> 22:06.409
freshmen who haven't really learned to study and 
get organized, is that they enforce what they call

21:54.591 --> 22:06.409
CQ. from seven to eleven you were expected to be at 
your desk studying and you could only go to the

22:07.435 --> 22:36.835
bathroom and anything else you had to have an 
excuse or something of that kind and it was

22:07.435 --> 22:36.835
enforced the doors had to be open sophomores 
patrolled with a board in their hand up and down the

22:07.435 --> 22:36.835
hall you had to have your head in your books well 
four hours of sitting at your desk is not to me the

22:07.435 --> 22:36.835
most conducive way to learn I mean I think it's good 
to you have to walk around a little and sometimes

22:07.435 --> 22:36.835
shift around and so forth But anyway, and I guess it 
was good for a lot of the incoming freshmen because

22:37.152 --> 22:43.821
a lot of them hadn't learned to study. And the other 
policy they had, if you were on the dean's list, the

22:44.883 --> 22:54.376
last half of the semester after midterm, you could 
go to bed at 10 o'clock. And sleep was the most

22:55.257 --> 23:03.549
precious thing for a freshman at those days when 
being in the corps because you got up early and

22:55.257 --> 23:03.549
everything. OK, well, the other thing I was going 
to say, I suppose most people have to go through

23:07.679 --> 23:26.211
kind of a crisis in learning how to study, and I 
probably had done that before I got here, in

23:07.679 --> 23:26.211
contrast to a lot of my peers, because when I 
switched from rural school to high school, in San

23:26.630 --> 23:27.712
Antonio. That was my biggest, that was even a 
bigger cultural shock than coming to A&M, but I

23:28.233 --> 23:41.196
really, really had to learn to study and they threw 
me into physics and a lot of these courses and I

23:28.233 --> 23:41.196
pretty well learned And I think there is, you know, 
something, everybody has to work it out for

23:41.902 --> 23:47.530
themselves, but I pretty well had done that before 
I got here. Now, who'd you stay with in San Antonio

23:47.931 --> 23:51.576
when you were... Well, I commuted. Oh. I commuted. 
Well, I did stay for a while during the bad

23:53.298 --> 23:56.703
wintertime, if you want to go back to that. It's an 
unbelievable saga. I lived three miles from the

24:01.931 --> 24:07.058
school, the rural school, or the highway. Mm-hmm. 
And in those days, during the war, they had

24:07.805 --> 24:17.095
instigated bus runs from San Antonio to Randolph 
Field, Texas for the workers. They had a lot of

24:17.776 --> 24:21.320
civilian workers, and the buses ran early in the 
morning. And I would bike in good weather, but my

24:22.101 --> 24:27.967
folks would take me most times. I had to catch the 
615 bus in the morning after getting there. ride

24:35.648 --> 24:38.991
that bus, which took about an hour to get into San 
Antonio. I remember they let me off at Joski's. And

24:41.914 --> 24:51.704
then I had to, you could either take a bus transfer 
or just walk five or six blocks down to St. Mary's

24:41.914 --> 24:51.704
Street and then take another city bus. And so I'd 
get there by eight o'clock. And then I'd have the

24:55.268 --> 24:57.590
same routine coming back. It got so bad in the 
winter of 40, that was still during the war, 44 and

24:58.431 --> 25:05.638
45, my friends, my parents had some good friends 
sergeant and his wife who lived at Fort Sam Houston

25:06.327 --> 25:34.849
and I spent the winter months with them like 
January, February, March or something and then

25:06.327 --> 25:34.849
just rode the city bus from there because it was 
grueling with the even got daylight saving time

25:06.327 --> 25:34.849
for the first time in those days and I didn't get 
light till 8 o'clock so that helped out but I

25:06.327 --> 25:34.849
basically commuted and I did most of my studying in 
route I mean I had lots of time with sitting on that

25:06.327 --> 25:34.849
bus back and forth and it cost very little But 
that's how I went to high school. Anyway, if you

25:39.116 --> 25:43.161
want to come back to the... Yeah, describe the room 
that you and... It was pretty spartan. You've seen

25:45.584 --> 25:48.327
them, I'm sure, or I don't know if you have. The 
rooms were quite small. They had one double deck

25:51.891 --> 25:56.076
bed on one side. How did you all decide who got the 
top deck? I have no idea. Probably flipped or

25:59.340 --> 26:00.481
something. I have no idea. Uh, we each had a desk 
with one bookshelf in each corner, the outside

26:01.829 --> 26:18.290
corner, and we each had a closet, and we each had a, I 
mean, we didn't have, there was a lavatory in the

26:01.829 --> 26:18.290
room, a sink, as we called it, lavatory. And that 
was it. No radio. I don't think, no, as freshmen

26:22.215 --> 26:24.898
weren't allowed radios, I'm pretty sure. I think 
it was an upper class. There were a lot of

26:25.880 --> 26:30.606
privileges that you got as you, and they were meted 
out as you got in, but. No rug. No rug, no. No

26:33.254 --> 26:33.974
curtains. No curtain, not for freshmen, no. 
Describe the routine of a typical weekday. What

26:41.001 --> 26:42.162
time did you all get up? What did you do? When? I'm 
not sure I can tell you the exact time. We got up

26:45.665 --> 26:49.428
pretty early because we marched to breakfast. We 
marched to every meal as a company. The roll call

26:53.532 --> 26:56.875
was held just, I mean, it was, you know, completely 
military. I think one of the sophomores. The

27:01.361 --> 27:08.249
sophomores were the corporals, the enforcers and 
so forth, and the juniors were the sergeants, and

27:01.361 --> 27:08.249
the seniors were the officers. But somebody come 
through hollering or whistling, you know, it's

27:08.890 --> 27:12.754
time to get up. And everybody got up. And you had a 
communal bathroom that everybody used, showers

27:15.297 --> 27:21.705
and commodes. You had your lavatory in your room. 
and you know we just got ready for the day and of

27:26.187 --> 27:53.224
course we had to be presentable shoes had to be 
perfectly shined starched ironed uniform

27:26.187 --> 27:53.224
everything had to be perfect before we left the 
room it had to be perfect I mean no dust no anything

27:26.187 --> 27:53.224
the old thing you know the coin test on the bed had to 
be made up so tight that the coin would bounce and

27:26.187 --> 27:53.224
that was all Aggies should be good husbands 
because they really learn how to how to take care of

27:54.082 --> 27:55.364
it. Everything had to be perfect. Your room was 
always subject to inspection. And then at another

27:59.290 --> 28:11.527
whistle or something, you fell out, as they called 
it, and you'd organize on those very sidewalks in

27:59.290 --> 28:11.527
the interior part of the new dormitory area, as 
they called it then, those twelve dormitories.

28:12.088 --> 28:15.533
You'd fall into companies by rank, I mean, you 
know, And you'd march to Duncan Hall and have your

28:16.222 --> 28:20.147
breakfast. Everything was family style in those 
days, which was nice because you got plenty to eat.

28:24.453 --> 28:29.119
As a farm boy, what was your impression of the food 
in Duncan? Well, I was happy with it. Of course, my

28:31.883 --> 28:33.865
mother was a good cook. The only thing I guess I 
disliked was we always accused the University

28:34.726 --> 28:41.976
of... killing their overage sheep. And I've 
learned to like lamb, but I didn't like mutton

28:46.844 --> 28:53.471
because you could smell it cooking way out there. 
But they had some very good food. They had lots of, I

28:55.693 --> 28:57.415
mean, there was plenty of it. I mean, it was good, 
wholesome food. There's no question about that.

28:59.857 --> 29:01.699
And you sat at the tables at a brace. As freshmen, 
you sat straight up. And you were in the middle, and

29:04.862 --> 29:08.806
there was a senior or junior or something. And they 
had to be fed first and everything. But you sat at a

29:11.943 --> 29:13.066
brace. And anyway, getting back, you marched in in 
battalions and just like your regular formation.

29:20.705 --> 29:22.269
And you had your assigned table. And the freshmen 
had to do it. Waiters brought the initial food. I

29:29.287 --> 29:36.396
think if the seniors or whoever, the 
upperclassmen sitting at your table wanted

29:29.287 --> 29:36.396
something else, you were sent, maybe sent back to 
get something. But the food was certainly

29:36.816 --> 29:39.139
adequate and wholesome. There's no question 
about it. But a lot of Aggies complained about it.

29:42.724 --> 29:49.732
And I guess because I was so cheap, I guess that was 
the word, I had to be economical because of that. I

29:50.353 --> 29:54.538
would never miss a meal there because my 
philosophy was I paid for the darn thing. But on

29:55.008 --> 30:03.918
Sunday mornings, I guess they were so glad to sleep 
in, a lot of Aggies slept in and got their own

29:55.008 --> 30:03.918
breakfast later on or bought it, but I couldn't 
afford that. There were only a handful of people

30:04.519 --> 30:07.182
that would go in on Sunday mornings. But all the 
other, even at noon then, you'd still start

30:07.262 --> 30:11.307
marching in again. But they did not have a march in 
on Sunday morning. And that happened three times a

30:14.491 --> 30:16.794
day. You had a formation, you fell in into your 
company ranks, and you marched to the mess hall,

30:16.834 --> 30:24.002
sat at the same table, And then you went back on your 
own, and volunteer classes or whatever else you

30:24.674 --> 30:28.359
had to do. And in the evening, the same way. Then the 
period between five and six was a rough period for

30:30.342 --> 30:38.914
freshmen. But they did have a lot of intramural 
athletics where it was organized, where you'd

30:40.016 --> 30:47.987
play football out in the drill field or whatever 
was available. And then you marched to mess, and

30:49.269 --> 30:51.913
they and I said between 7 and 11 was CQ and nothing 
was supposed to happen. Nothing was supposed to

30:57.203 --> 31:16.568
happen after that either but it varied by 
companies and I said we had a particularly

30:57.203 --> 31:16.568
diabolical unit it seemed like maybe just seemed 
like that to me but it was so bad that they did as I

30:57.203 --> 31:16.568
said disband the unit because the things got out of 
hand in the end of the semester and reassigned us to

30:57.203 --> 31:16.568
other other, other units after the first 
semester. That first semester, you remember how

31:20.645 --> 31:23.530
many hours you took? I always took a heavy load. In 
fact, you won't believe this, I took as high as 24

31:26.695 --> 31:28.938
hours. Sure. And, uh. But at the first, I think 
about 17 or 18 hours. What did you, where did you

31:33.625 --> 31:37.972
find a hideaway? A place? The library.
