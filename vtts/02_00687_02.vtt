00:05.819 --> 00:10.226
Okay, let's go back to where we were. I guess if I jog 
my memory, I could find a couple more, but two

00:10.246 --> 00:17.937
things I can tell you that you might not hear very 
often. One was when we had the search to replace

00:18.658 --> 00:24.266
Hubert.

00:25.929 --> 00:34.982
The central administration of Texas A&M, and I 
mean from the president on down, were absolutely

00:25.929 --> 00:34.982
amazed by the quality of that we had who were 
interested in the deanship of Texas A&M. We had the

00:41.815 --> 00:47.784
former dean at Ohio State, which was then ranked 
number two in College of Education nationwide.

00:48.605 --> 00:51.449
And he was one of the grand architects of that who 
was interested. We had a couple of other people who

00:52.571 --> 00:56.697
were really premier researchers. One, the 
president of the International Reading Society.

01:01.805 --> 01:05.290
But the four finalists that we brought to the table 
for that, impressed the administration. Were you

01:08.956 --> 01:09.958
on that committee? Yes. I'd even go so far that they 
suggested there wasn't another college then at

01:11.240 --> 01:21.015
Texas A&M that could get people from those 
prestigious universities to apply. They were

01:21.055 --> 01:26.543
just immensely impressed with the people we had. 
And it did a lot to help transform the image of the

01:27.405 --> 01:32.172
college. Every college is trying to transform its 
image in a more positive way. Was there one thing

01:35.986 --> 01:39.672
that put Corrigan above these? Since they were all 
such, what finally leaned the committee or the

01:39.772 --> 01:47.466
search or whoever towards Corrigan? What was it 
about him that stood out above these other

01:47.526 --> 01:51.333
fantastics? I would say it's a very open style. It 
just, it was immediately apparent when you met

01:57.717 --> 02:11.579
Corrigan, any context in that search, whether it 
was in the college or over at the president's

01:57.717 --> 02:11.579
office, just a real gregarious and amicable and 
friendly, friendly person. The other bit, and

02:12.100 --> 02:17.309
more important, is that what Corrigan did was give 
a lecture. And that lecture centered on equity.

02:24.076 --> 02:27.741
For administration people, there are three big 
things that we study. Effectiveness,

02:27.761 --> 02:30.766
efficiency, and equity. In fact, the whole study 
of administration might be geared around those

02:30.786 --> 02:34.472
three anchors. Corrigan gave a very clear message 
when he gave his lecture, and it was delivered over

02:35.313 --> 02:50.235
in the small theater in Rudder, that he was very 
much interested in equity, very much interested

02:35.313 --> 02:50.235
in students' rights. very interested in these 
types of policy issues being central in the

02:52.342 --> 03:04.135
activities, not only research, but research, 
teaching, and service activities of the college.

03:04.256 --> 03:08.140
If he were to be a dean, that would be a concern. That 
rallied, I'd say, 30 of the premier folks in the

03:09.021 --> 03:20.374
college to start lobbying the entire

03:09.021 --> 03:20.374
search committee. topped over all the way across 
the table. Once he came to campus, he was the first

03:25.343 --> 03:28.927
choice. What about Jim McNamara's contribution? 
How can we summarize that? And I know you're a long

03:35.155 --> 03:38.239
ways from reaching your peak because you keep... 
I'm sure you want to wrap this up, but I want to tell

03:38.299 --> 03:43.666
you this one other, because it's a document you 
need to look at. And it does have some really good

03:43.686 --> 03:45.829
things. Second thing that really impressed... 
The central administration and the teacher

03:50.307 --> 03:59.176
education community at large, the national 
teacher education community, were R ratings on

03:50.307 --> 03:59.176
the NK study. I have that one.

04:05.161 --> 04:12.328
As a matter of fact, three or four of the people who 
were on the NK team tried to come to Texas A&M. John

04:12.348 --> 04:17.293
Dillard is one of the members on the NK team who was 
at Texas A&M. John came from Oklahoma State, the

04:17.442 --> 04:19.765
Texas A&M. He was on the search committee. We got 
accolades almost across the board, but the one

04:22.207 --> 04:31.978
place where we got accolades that almost no other 
institution got them... Now, this was on which

04:22.207 --> 04:31.978
one? The 1970, which MCAT? The most recent MCAT, 
the last MCAT we had. It would have to be since 1980,

04:36.764 --> 04:41.008
so it's probably in 83 or 82. Yeah, somewhere 
around there, in the early 80s. We got accolades on

04:45.117 --> 04:49.865
the long-range planning and program evaluation 
standard. That same year, both Purdue and

04:50.646 --> 04:58.339
Alabama, which are two large universities, were 
failed. And the statistics I looked at before we

05:00.443 --> 05:08.256
had the review showed that almost no institutions 
pick up accolades or highest marks. When they

05:09.721 --> 05:13.186
looked at what we did... Are those in the report? 
The marks are in the report itself? Yeah. Okay. We

05:15.189 --> 05:16.872
picked up accolades on that standard. And one of 
the reasons... Well, I wrote that standard. It's

05:21.939 --> 05:22.820
Standard 6. You might want to look at that report. 
It captures a lot of the inquiry activity. It

05:26.446 --> 05:27.988
captures a lot of the things. One thing that put us 
right over the top was that we did an international

05:28.649 --> 05:37.602
telephone sample of our former graduates in the 
College of Ed, 240 of them, 40 from each of the six

05:38.341 --> 05:46.513
departments. And we asked our graduate students, 
former graduate students, how can we improve

05:46.633 --> 05:54.644
Texas A&M? And there are seven volumes in that. I 
can tell you just this one thing. You'll see why

06:02.436 --> 06:04.078
there's seven volumes. There were ten, we played 
the twenty questions game. There would be ten

06:08.393 --> 06:18.309
questions that would be common across all six 
departments, and then there would be ten

06:08.393 --> 06:18.309
questions that would be unique in each 
department. So if you summed over any department,

06:18.329 --> 06:31.028
they had ten evaluation and planning questions 
which were unique to them, and they had ten that

06:18.329 --> 06:31.028
related to them and to the college as well.

06:32.999 --> 06:40.049
We involved over 120 members in the College of 
Education doing that study. We had department

06:40.069 --> 06:42.753
heads doing telephone calls.

06:45.397 --> 06:52.708
Now, these are true, random samples of our 
graduates since 1969, right up to 1982. And the

06:53.689 --> 06:58.216
whole push of that survey was, we respect your 
professional competence. Tell us how we can be

06:58.236 --> 06:59.698
better. Tell us what we can do to maintain 
continuing contacts with y'all. Where can I find

07:04.741 --> 07:05.843
all that? I'll give you a setup. All right. Now, I 
would say that that's probably one of my best

07:08.626 --> 07:14.073
contributions to Texas A&M. And it was really a 
turning point in just selling me on the

07:14.093 --> 07:18.038
institution. I've always been sold on it. I'm up 
beyond it. The dean underwrote that study. The

07:24.467 --> 07:27.070
department heads cooperated. Seven students 
taking advanced doctoral work with me designed

07:28.180 --> 07:35.187
the entire architecture for that study. And it 
involved working with 120 people. And then we

07:38.991 --> 07:44.977
reported, yes, about half of those people are 
faculty and about half are students. And when that

07:46.198 --> 07:50.183
NK commission saw that study, it just put their 
lights out. They had never seen anything like that

07:50.203 --> 07:52.585
anywhere. Has there something come out of that 
that has really made dramatic change in the

07:53.358 --> 07:58.464
college? What was done with all that information, 
and how was it utilized? I'm going to say there

08:02.809 --> 08:03.851
isn't. And I think you're going to appreciate my 
reason why. Administration,

08:06.193 --> 08:17.247
it never links its success to a single thing, to a 
whole conglomerate of things. A really cheap

08:18.308 --> 08:22.673
analogy might be someone who's running for school 
board and gets elected. And then they want to give

08:23.716 --> 08:25.898
some advice to someone else. And they had yard 
signs and brochures. Now, which one do you want to

08:32.505 --> 08:35.328
give up? Well, they don't know what to give up. They 
just know that when you take the yard signs and the

08:36.509 --> 08:41.575
brochures together, they got them elected. I 
would say that there were several things since

08:42.956 --> 08:50.584
when Corrigan came that were all in that same 
orbit, inquiry group activity, the increasing

08:51.779 --> 09:08.319
quality in some of the enrollment, the new sense of 
mission, the study, faculty members who were

08:51.779 --> 09:08.319
becoming tenured and seasoned and now didn't have 
to worry about individual efforts but could be

08:51.779 --> 09:08.319
team players. They were mentoring younger 
faculty. I would say all those things taken

09:11.163 --> 09:16.970
collectively enhanced the college. And that all 
the things were falling into place for us to make

09:21.665 --> 09:25.249
some real quantum leaps. And I would say that both 
Hubert and Corrigan are responsible with

09:25.270 --> 09:33.259
different leadership styles, different pieces 
of the pie. They're all responsible for creating

09:34.141 --> 09:38.406
the advocacy and enthusiasm of our faculty. And is 
there something, as you look into the future, say

09:40.148 --> 09:47.778
the year 2000 and even beyond, where do you think 
that's going to take us? What do you think will be

09:47.938 --> 09:49.680
the ultimate What will we reap from all of this 
leadership and so forth? Yeah. I'm worried about

09:54.328 --> 09:56.691
where the college is going now. I think we're

09:57.352 --> 10:05.183
not ready to take the big quantum leap it takes to do 
research. I've alluded to that in some of my

10:05.203 --> 10:08.808
comments. I think people are burned out in terms of 
stretching themselves to be involved in other

10:09.388 --> 10:15.617
efforts. And if the college is going to be really 
somewhere in the year 2000, you must remember the

10:16.458 --> 10:22.344
people that brought them. Now, a good example. For 
years, Donna Norton has been, and I would say

10:26.268 --> 10:33.615
she's, add her name to the premier list of 
researchers in the college, if you can go back. And

10:34.536 --> 10:35.477
I'll give you the echo. Add Donna Norton to the 
list. Right. OK. Donna is now without the money

10:37.999 --> 10:44.526
from the Meadows Foundation grant. And what do 
they have her doing? teaching three courses. The

10:47.501 --> 10:51.966
day that the grant's run out, people are back to 
these. Now, that doesn't happen in all the

10:53.448 --> 11:07.425
departments, but there's a really good example of 
a researcher who made an enormous contribution

10:53.448 --> 11:07.425
with her research on training low-achieving 
minority students in reading. And literally took

11:08.226 --> 11:14.474
the lowest 5% of the readers in Bryan and made 
astronomical gains with them. And now what's she

11:14.534 --> 11:15.355
doing? She's back teaching three courses. 
They're giving her a lot more committee

11:17.656 --> 11:19.699
assignments. Do you understand what I'm saying? 
Sure. That's what I'm worried about in the

11:23.304 --> 11:24.946
college. I'm worried that that's not there. What 
would be the ideal would be for her to be able to get

11:27.029 --> 11:31.155
funding from somewhere else? Is that what... 
Well, I think it's like any other R&D effort in a

11:31.456 --> 11:36.543
corporation. If someone's productive for four or 
five years... They either need a sabbatical or

11:39.905 --> 11:48.803
they need some sort of downtime where they can just 
sort of reflect on that activity and sort of get

11:39.905 --> 11:48.803
their battery run up again. Is there a sabbatical 
program in place? I mean, do people get

11:50.707 --> 11:52.431
sabbaticals and stuff? There's a sabbatical that 
you can apply to for the university, but we don't

11:52.451 --> 11:56.800
have that. A lot of our people don't want to leave 
just now. They're here, and they're smart enough

11:59.395 --> 12:06.703
to know that they want their kids to be in a single 
school system all the way through, at least until

11:59.395 --> 12:06.703
they get out of high school. If you look at our 
demography, most of our faculty are there, so they

12:07.324 --> 12:11.729
don't want to leave. But they need internal 
relief, not a sabbatical. By internal relief, you

12:15.573 --> 12:19.918
mean just time to... Yeah, some time to reflect. 
They create their own monastic retreat and

12:21.012 --> 12:30.224
reflect on what made their immediate past so 
productive, so useful. What are its

12:30.425 --> 12:32.167
implications? I don't see the college in a 
reflective mode. I don't see it trying to reward

12:35.571 --> 12:41.299
people. We've hit a plateau of success. I've heard 
that word already twice today, that we are in a

12:43.475 --> 12:46.899
plateau. Do you see your role within the college 
changing at all in the near future? Will your focus

12:51.825 --> 12:55.029
still be maintained where you are now? I guess I'd 
answer the question by posing another question

12:55.069 --> 13:00.395
and answering it. What would I like to be 
remembered for in the next 10 years? If people

13:06.262 --> 13:09.025
summed over my productivity, from 1987 to 1997, 
I'd like to be remembered for being the grand

13:09.308 --> 13:22.380
architect who put together the 
School-University Research Collaborative. I

13:22.400 --> 13:24.001
want to work on applied research. I want to work on 
communicating and translating research

13:25.683 --> 13:31.248
findings for practitioners and policymakers. I 
don't want to be a theoretician. And the

13:34.411 --> 13:36.953
School-University Collaborative provides 
those opportunities to link the profession as

13:37.540 --> 13:41.572
Corden would say. That's where I am. This has 
really been wonderful. I totally appreciate your

13:44.601 --> 13:50.217
time and your insights because they're 
invaluable.
