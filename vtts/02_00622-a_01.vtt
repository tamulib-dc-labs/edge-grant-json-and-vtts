00:04.199 --> 00:09.586
Now, Professor Dease, I would like you to explain 
to me your interest and how your interest in

00:04.199 --> 00:09.586
oceanography developed. Well, I was a student at 
the University of Illinois back in the 30s, and I

00:11.989 --> 00:33.177
became interested in geology, as in those days 
most people did, either by being what we now call

00:11.989 --> 00:33.177
rock hounds or by paleontology, vertebrate 
paleontology, but I... interested in geology

00:34.102 --> 01:02.522
through a colleague in collecting minerals from 
New Jersey around the famous localities of

00:34.102 --> 01:02.522
Franklin Furnace and also through contact with 
the American Museum of Natural History in New York

00:34.102 --> 01:02.522
and this is basically why I became interested in 
geology and with that background I went to the

00:34.102 --> 01:02.522
University of Illinois for no good reason. I went 
there to be far away from home. I thought that was

01:09.946 --> 01:15.433
sort of out in Indian country, being born in New 
Jersey. But my

01:16.495 --> 01:26.227
mother was recently deceased, and my father was 
just beginning of the Depression years, and

01:16.495 --> 01:26.227
things were very difficult financially. So I 
hitchhiked out there and reported in. I presented

01:32.303 --> 01:33.785
myself and was accepted. My brother-in-law had 
been there at the University of Illinois. And I

01:40.895 --> 01:48.086
went through seven years of school, by the way, at 
the University of Illinois on a total budget of

01:40.895 --> 01:48.086
$400, which is being rather remarkable. That is 
about $400 outside help from my family. The rest I

01:51.571 --> 01:53.614
earned my own way all the way through. But in my 
junior year, I became under the influence of two

02:02.999 --> 02:04.261
professors there. One was Francis, Francis 
Shepherd, and the other was Harold, Harold

02:04.301 --> 02:09.349
Wanless. Harold Wanless, his son now, Harold 
Wanless, is now a, on the staff across the street at

02:11.352 --> 02:20.165
Rosenstiel. But, Shepherd, at that time, I guess I 
was just in my senior year then, and he was

02:32.581 --> 02:39.528
beginning his work in marine geology. You asked 
why people become interested in oceanography in

02:40.869 --> 02:44.593
those days. I think oceanography was a rich man's 
hobby in the 30s. And prior to that, it was people

02:50.899 --> 03:01.930
who were yachtsmen and interested in the sea and 
had the means or connection to pursue these

02:50.899 --> 03:01.930
interests.

03:03.023 --> 03:04.545
Well, we can come back to that. But anyway, Shepard 
at that time received a applied for and received a

03:04.625 --> 03:20.102
grant to study the submarine canyons off the 
California coast from the Geological Society of

03:04.625 --> 03:20.102
America. And this was a grant for $10,000 from the 
newly established Penrose Fund. Penrose was a

03:32.032 --> 03:40.201
mining engineer who made substantial sums of 
money, I believe, mainly in the copper mines of

03:32.032 --> 03:40.201
northern Michigan. And he left a big question. As I 
recall, it was $3.5 million to the, something of

03:44.326 --> 03:53.416
that order, to the Geological Society of America 
and an equal amount to the Philosophical Society

03:44.326 --> 03:53.416
of Philadelphia.

03:56.079 --> 03:58.782
And this grant was of unheard of size. Because most 
grants before that time had been maybe up to

03:59.977 --> 04:03.001
$1,000. But to have a $10,000 grant was rather 
unheard of. It was unique. That would be 1936, I

04:11.051 --> 04:14.296
suppose. Now, Shepard, with that money, proposed 
going to Scripps and

04:15.998 --> 04:28.434
using an oceanographic vessel, the E.W. Scripps, 
for an entire year. Plus, all the expenses

04:31.212 --> 04:35.177
involved in $10,000. This also would be rather 
remarkable nowadays, because even as of 10 years

04:35.237 --> 04:43.967
ago, the cost of a ship was something like $1 per ton 
per day. And now I suppose the cost is something

04:44.828 --> 04:49.094
like $2 per ton per day for the use of a ship. In other 
words, $10,000 might last you two days. But in

04:53.939 --> 05:01.168
those days, it was programmed to last a year, at 
least six months usage of a boat, which we in fact

04:53.939 --> 05:01.168
essentially got. six months at sea. Well anyway, 
Shepard was a professor at University of Illinois

05:04.713 --> 05:22.836
and he was

05:04.713 --> 05:22.836
came from a rather wealthy family and

05:04.713 --> 05:22.836
he had became interested in, he had his PhD from 
Chicago and came to Illinois and he was in

05:24.132 --> 05:51.625
structural geology but I guess he went back to 
Marblehead and became interested in collecting

05:24.132 --> 05:51.625
sediments on the shelf off the Atlantic coast and 
he discovered that they didn't just decrease from

05:24.132 --> 05:51.625
coarse to fine as was the classic idea offshore but 
there was a very random distribution of sediments

05:24.132 --> 05:51.625
and he developed his interest in marine geology. 
And he, I think, is properly recognized as the

05:55.761 --> 06:11.960
father of oceanography, at least for the U.S. And a 
good many students all over the country now are his

05:55.761 --> 06:11.960
students, or students of his students. And he 
wrote his first paper with George Coee, but then

06:12.161 --> 06:19.249
with this grant he enlisted Emory, Kenkel Emory 
and myself, students at the University of

06:19.988 --> 06:28.176
Illinois, to work with him. Well, in fact, I guess 
he enlisted Emory. Emory had just arrived in his

06:31.439 --> 06:48.375
junior year from, he had spent two years in school 
at Texas, and he had gone to the San Diego World's

06:31.439 --> 06:48.375
Fair of 1935, and to let you know how penurious 
things were in those days. He came back riding the

06:51.517 --> 06:53.699
rods in a railroad train. When he got as far as 
Illinois, it became too tired to go any further. He

06:58.143 --> 07:00.065
got off and went to school for that reason. This is 
how he chose Illinois, because he was tired of

07:00.125 --> 07:03.808
riding that freight train. But Emory,

07:06.470 --> 07:13.317
I think, is the only true genius I've ever known. 
And you can describe genius as being 99% work. He

07:18.521 --> 07:19.122
was a really dedicated and a worker. And at that 
time, Shepard

07:24.217 --> 07:35.389
was working up what we call the boat sheets of the 
Coast and Geodetic Survey. He was contouring the

07:35.429 --> 07:36.651
boat sheets. He was making topographic maps, 
particularly of the California region,

07:36.671 --> 07:45.480
bathymetric maps based upon the USGS contour 
sheets. And Emory was doing this, mainly the basic

07:47.323 --> 07:50.827
contouring. And I got involved in a small way. But 
when this grant came through, rather

07:53.591 --> 08:02.181
than Shepard really hiring me, I learned about it. 
And I went to Shepard. I guess I was sufficiently

08:03.302 --> 08:07.547
aggressive to hunt him out and suggest this 
myself. And he accepted the fact that I also should

08:07.687 --> 08:12.433
join the project. And with that, began my series of 
sojourns to California with Emory and with

08:16.291 --> 08:23.058
Shepard. And

08:23.519 --> 08:31.668
Shepard was remarkable in that he not only 
accepted us as his students, we became really part

08:23.519 --> 08:31.668
of his family. We both lived in his attic room in his 
house there in Urbana, Emory and I. But we began a

08:39.036 --> 08:44.982
series of trips to California.

08:46.733 --> 08:51.379
spending a semester at Illinois and a semester in 
the summer at Scripps. I guess this first year we,

08:52.661 --> 09:13.490
and working on this project, first on this one 
grand of $10,000, I

08:52.661 --> 09:13.490
think this money was spent, well, Emery and I 
received $30 a month. We received a dollar a day for

09:13.510 --> 09:15.593
our services.

09:18.728 --> 09:21.491
And this involved going back and forth to Scripps, 
hitchhiking. We went hitchhiking, or one time I

09:21.531 --> 09:26.597
went to Chicago and joined one of these carpools. 
And I went all the way to California for $10 in a

09:27.938 --> 09:31.402
carpool. So this is the sort of operation you ran in 
those days. Yes?

09:37.349 --> 09:41.894
Did the romance of sea have anything to do with you 
choosing to work with Professor Shepherd? Oh,

09:43.576 --> 09:45.698
yes, definitely.

09:47.129 --> 09:52.295
The sea was an

09:47.129 --> 09:52.295
interesting environment. It was an environment 
where the sea only reflected the sky. We didn't

09:58.561 --> 10:06.130
have any idea what was beneath the sea, and they 
were very rather classical and primitive ideas. I

10:06.930 --> 10:15.820
guess the amount of or the lack of knowledge of the 
sea was remarkable in those days. we knew there

10:17.217 --> 10:20.582
were submarine canyons. We knew there was a 
continental shelf, and we knew there was a

10:21.122 --> 10:27.651
continental slope. We knew nothing, essentially 
nothing, about the topography or the

10:28.112 --> 10:45.115
geomorphology of the deep ocean, and only very 
primitive information upon the sediments of the

10:28.112 --> 10:45.115
continental shelf and the nature of what we now 
call the shelf break. The state of knowledge was

10:46.512 --> 10:48.595
remarkably primitive. Did this encourage you to 
enter the field? It seems like the field has been an

10:51.138 --> 10:54.383
uncertain future for geologists. Well, not only 
uncertain, it had no future because there's no

10:55.524 --> 11:05.618
demand for something which hasn't been invented 
yet. And Shepard did it out of love of the sea. He was

11:09.583 --> 11:15.912
a yachtsman and raised by the sea, and he had this 
basic lore and love of a New Englander for the sea.

11:16.820 --> 11:19.303
His father was another famous yachtsman. In the 
case of Emery and myself, we knew nothing about the

11:21.446 --> 11:27.173
sea, but we were intrigued by the mystery of the 
sea.

11:31.859 --> 11:35.063
But being a marine geologist, the word had been 
invented. Even being an oceanographer, it hadn't

11:35.083 --> 11:36.945
been invented. And this was analogous with a 
person opting to be a poet. And when you said you

11:42.512 --> 11:46.337
were doing oceanography, people said, what's 
that? You went to Scripps and there was a, where

11:47.937 --> 12:02.262
Scripps Institution now is, there was the only 
sign on the road going out there that said, public

11:47.937 --> 12:02.262
sign, put up the highway department and said, fish 
lab, pointing out fish lab two miles. That was the

12:02.302 --> 12:11.498
only people in town in La Jolla didn't really 
realize that this was a marine biologic

12:02.302 --> 12:11.498
laboratory or even an oceanographic laboratory.

12:12.592 --> 12:15.276
This was a general state of knowledge. Well, did 
you feel any hesitancy about trying this, or were

12:16.118 --> 12:21.025
you just young and anxious? Well, no hesitancies 
at all, no. A matter of being young and aggressive

12:23.009 --> 12:26.995
and interested. And besides, there really wasn't 
much to turn to, because

12:27.075 --> 12:40.236
the employment situation was so bad that you 
really You didn't have people advising you on

12:40.807 --> 12:44.532
careers. And even at these wages, this at least was 
a job, was something to do, and something very

12:45.713 --> 12:54.764
exciting to do. But it was just like being a poet. My 
other interest when I was a child was from reading

12:56.867 --> 13:05.397
books of science, like James Dean's.

13:15.063 --> 13:20.568
I became interested in also in astronomy as a child 
from reading books by James Jeans and Eddington.

13:22.329 --> 13:28.415
And this was also on a par with, I guess, being a 
poet. There were no careers in astronomy. And so I

13:34.120 --> 13:40.085
think the practicality of doing geology perhaps 
is one reason why I went in that direction. As far as

13:40.906 --> 13:44.749
being an oceanographer or a marine geologist, 
this was on par with it. with being a poet nowadays.

13:47.574 --> 13:50.418
I hope being a poet in the future isn't always such a 
bleak field. It shouldn't be. It's very useful.

13:56.886 --> 14:05.117
How would you explain then, for example, let's say 
Stetson and Shepherd's decision to ply the field

13:56.886 --> 14:05.117
separately and on different coasts and yet kind of 
simultaneously? Well,

14:06.399 --> 14:13.268
this was perhaps fortuitous.

14:15.121 --> 14:20.307
Shepard was a New Englander, and he came to 
University of Illinois. And he had visited the

14:21.588 --> 14:31.400
West Coast and did this very preliminary work on 
submarine canyons and became intrigued with the

14:21.588 --> 14:31.400
West Coast. And of course, the submarine canyons 
were accessible because they come right on to the

14:31.600 --> 14:38.187
beach line. And you could survey them by rowboat, 
by lead line, and by very, very simple techniques.

14:45.783 --> 14:47.305
of investigating Submarine Canyon. So I think 
this is why his thrust was towards the West. So he

14:50.769 --> 14:54.072
became a Californian by adoption. Stetson, I 
think, also was, in a sense, an oceanographer as a

14:55.234 --> 15:02.121
rich man's hobby. I'm not sure whether he was very 
wealthy, but I guess he was reasonably so. Other

15:07.187 --> 15:12.313
examples, of course, of this, of the rich man's 
hobby, is this is how many people got in. Columbus,

15:12.698 --> 15:16.062
Disneyland, for example, and I think it also 
applies to Roger Revelle. But this was more or less

15:18.044 --> 15:21.368
the background of early oceanographers. I mean, 
going back to Alexander

15:21.468 --> 15:32.160
Agassiz and the Albatross in the turn of the 
century, these people were people of wealth who

15:21.468 --> 15:32.160
became interested in the sea.

15:34.923 --> 15:37.606
Was it easier to acquire a vessel in the 30s? I was 
amazed that you were able to acquire the scripts

15:37.766 --> 15:41.170
for six months with what seems to be not a great deal 
of effort. Now there's a couple of your waiting

15:44.430 --> 15:47.275
lists frequently. Well, the E.W.

15:54.627 --> 16:02.681
Scripps was acquired from Louis Stone, a 
Hollywood actor, and either purchased or given to

15:54.627 --> 16:02.681
Scripps. The previous history of oceanographic 
vessels, including the early vessel scrips that

16:07.998 --> 16:10.242
had caught on fire and burned. And this is also as 
typical of many, of early oceanography, as many,

16:10.282 --> 16:16.693
many, many tragic happenings with oceanographic 
ships. The French ship, the Puercoipa, the

16:16.833 --> 16:23.705
Carnegie that burnt in the Pacific, the 
non-magnetic ship and so forth. But the E.W.

16:24.967 --> 16:30.537
Scripps was acquired from a Hollywood actor at 
nominal, a very small cost. I guess it was

16:30.577 --> 16:32.520
purchased through the funds of of Robert Scripps, 
who was, I guess, the son of Ellen Browning and E.W.

16:40.510 --> 16:40.811
Scripps. But

16:42.653 --> 16:49.101
then, as now, there were no funds to run ships. You 
could acquire ships, but you didn't have funds.

16:52.946 --> 16:58.913
The whole budget of Scripps Institution when I was 
there was $125,000.

17:01.053 --> 17:07.901
Our budget for running our marine geology lab was 
$50 a year, buying all the equipment, chemicals,

17:01.053 --> 17:07.901
glassware.

17:11.065 --> 17:15.330
So Scripps had that ship, and Harold Sverdip had 
just arrived. And he wanted to do a serial

17:16.832 --> 17:25.162
collection of oceanographic data, but he didn't 
have the funds to operate the ship. So Shepard came

17:25.262 --> 17:28.326
along with money. albeit a small amount. I think it 
may be the cost of what he put into the, I guess he put

17:30.291 --> 17:42.243
in about maybe $6,000 of the $10,000 just for into 
the operating ship, worth about $1,000 a month for

17:30.291 --> 17:42.243
about six months operation. So that's how that 
came about.

17:50.171 --> 17:54.735
Now, describe very briefly the shipboard routine 
that you went through on this early vessel. Did

17:55.677 --> 18:00.824
you, for example, handle all the cooking 
yourself, or do you have special duties and

17:55.677 --> 18:00.824
watches? Well, we did everything. The crew 
consisted of a skipper, an engineer, and one mate

18:03.668 --> 18:13.421
deckhand. In other words, a crew of three. And I 
guess we also, on long trips, we had a cook crew of

18:15.043 --> 18:20.250
four. Otherwise, the scientists also acted as 
technicians. We stood watches. We were on the

18:29.705 --> 18:43.378
helm, and we stood watches of, I guess, six on, six 
off, or four on, eight off, or whatever. And we also

18:44.659 --> 18:48.583
operated all the... the winches, all the 
equipment, and also

18:49.593 --> 18:57.826
did all the chemical work aboard. We did the 
analyses for phosphates and nitrates aboard

18:57.866 --> 19:02.273
ships. So the scientific staff, which may have 
been another four or five people, was not

19:02.293 --> 19:09.684
specialized as of today. We stood all the watches 
and ran the echo sounder and recorded the

19:09.785 --> 19:17.136
soundings.

19:17.622 --> 19:18.583
This was very good. This made us really, because 
E.W. Scripps was a very small ship. It was 96 feet,

19:22.047 --> 19:25.972
and it only had a freeboard of three or four feet. We 
really felt close to the sea, and the decks were

19:25.992 --> 19:32.961
awash and developed a very intimate relationship 
to the sea. It's not as intimate as a scuba diver

19:33.261 --> 19:42.432
gets today, but it was a much more intimate 
relationship than you have aboard modern ships

19:33.261 --> 19:42.432
when you're I mean, being right on the sea and being 
in the splash and seeing the water is a lot

19:42.817 --> 19:53.129
different from being up on a large ship removed 
from the sea, really, being dry. What were scripts

19:54.271 --> 19:55.792
like when you arrived? The staff could not have 
been very large. No, there was a

20:00.057 --> 20:05.524
half a dozen scientists. Perhaps the most eminent 
one was the newly arrived Harold Sverdrup, but

20:10.070 --> 20:23.449
really the classical naturalist was Sumner, who 
worked on evolution problems. And he was a real

20:23.529 --> 20:26.073
classical naturalist. He was the Carl Hubbs of 
those days. Now the naturalist there is Carl

20:29.978 --> 20:32.582
Hubbs, as you probably know. In any scientific 
laboratory, like at Scripps, which for example,

20:33.984 --> 20:38.490
at Scripps, Just a few years back, I came to Scripps 
with a, I lived and living in the Ohio, and I arrived

20:39.415 --> 20:58.923
at Scripps with a mushroom or a fungus from my yard, 
and I couldn't find anybody in the whole place who

20:39.415 --> 20:58.923
could tell me what it was except for Carl Hubbs, and 
right away he could tell me the genus and species.

21:00.205 --> 21:06.874
It was Amanita phalloides, which is a very 
poisonous one, but he was the person you would go to

21:00.205 --> 21:06.874
for any questions of general.

21:11.232 --> 21:16.778
In Illinois, we had Professor Wanless, who was a 
man of this type, who more or less had very broad

21:11.232 --> 21:16.778
general knowledge. But Scripps was, and before 
that Sumner was this type of person. He was a

21:23.065 --> 21:29.311
nationalist there, and it was very primitive by 
modern standards. Only that one Ritter Hall and

21:29.412 --> 21:34.857
Scripps Hall were there. We had one one secretary 
for the entire Scripps Institution, director

21:36.925 --> 21:41.350
secretary. She also, I guess, was business 
manager, as well as being secretary, and a very

21:41.370 --> 21:49.460
small staff.

21:52.123 --> 21:54.626
What were your first interests when you arrived at 
Scripps? Towards what did you try to drive your

21:54.966 --> 22:01.954
geological training?

22:04.617 --> 22:15.272
We were assistants to Francis Shepard, of course, 
and our interest was

22:04.617 --> 22:15.272
getting to sea on EW scripts as soon as possible. 
And to build and design the equipment, we needed to

22:17.094 --> 22:29.010
investigate the topography and the submarine 
canyons and the offshore. This involved right

22:29.070 --> 22:31.654
away in making making dredges, coring devices, 
current meters, sediment traps. The EWS Cripps

22:43.357 --> 22:50.207
had a new echo sounder aboard it, one of the early 
submarine signal flashing light. It was not a

22:50.247 --> 23:01.624
recording echo sounder, but it was the latest 
thing in echo sounding because part of that you

22:50.247 --> 23:01.624
simply had to lower a line with a weight on it, but 
now they had a sonic echo sounder. And so we had to

23:02.988 --> 23:10.256
get all the equipment together and get it working 
and even design things. You couldn't buy things

23:10.296 --> 23:11.617
off the shelf. And so we had to look through 
literature and see what had been made and make our

23:13.119 --> 23:19.425
own and make new ones. And we also had to do this at a 
very little expense. We had to go down and pick up

23:22.068 --> 23:30.497
lead in the scrap yard and melt it down and make 
weights and design our own coring device. gravity

23:31.878 --> 23:32.899
type. Emery and I designed what was then a new type 
of coring device. And also at that time, Shepard

23:37.885 --> 23:55.405
invested a substantial amount of his money, which 
was $1,000, in the abortive Varney-Redwine

23:37.885 --> 23:55.405
hydrostatic corer, which was, as you probably 
will hear something about in these recordings,

23:55.840 --> 23:56.841
did not actually work. The whole thing collapsed 
and imploded. But anyway, this was one of the

23:59.264 --> 24:08.575
abortive things was to have these two UCLA 
students develop this device. So we were mainly

24:09.656 --> 24:21.970
involved in getting the work at sea underway and 
designing and building equipment with our own

24:09.656 --> 24:21.970
hands and with the assistance of one technician 
there named Carl Johnson. He was a Scripps

24:22.010 --> 24:25.054
technician, and he was very He would help us, and he 
had a machine shop, and we would build this

24:26.030 --> 24:30.537
equipment. Yeah, I have some questions I'd like to 
ask you about the development of your devices.

24:36.906 --> 24:42.714
What was the story behind the failure of the Vorney 
hydrostatic core? What was its flaw that caused it

24:43.355 --> 24:45.438
not to work? Well, it was, of course, based upon 
using the hydrostatic pressure of the sea to drive

24:47.100 --> 24:55.092
the piston. and drive the core barrel. And the 
principle is valid. In any sort of a new

25:04.007 --> 25:12.037
development like that, it's a lot more complex 
than it seems. It isn't something you develop some

25:12.297 --> 25:15.041
weekend or overnight. And it's quite proper for 
the first, expectable nowadays, for the first

25:16.422 --> 25:24.572
models not to work.

25:25.598 --> 25:55.285
I think Shepard was very impatient about the whole 
thing, and he is a man who likes devices with more

25:25.598 --> 25:55.285
than one electronic tube or transistor, because 
he was always, he was not mechanically inclined

25:25.598 --> 25:55.285
himself, and the Varney-Redwine thing took a long 
time to, was a fancy piece of equipment, and when it

25:25.598 --> 25:55.285
was finally tested, it simply imploded and we just 
came back with a frayed bitter end of the cable so it

25:55.568 --> 26:07.180
isn't quite clear what happened but it apparently 
did not withstand the hydrostatic pressures of

25:55.568 --> 26:07.180
the ocean. Well what did you work on beside the 
600-pound gravity core? Did you develop any other

26:12.305 --> 26:14.587
devices in this period? No, I would say that was the 
only sort of a

26:16.549 --> 26:23.196
device which was in any way new. We did some 
experiments with it, and we got involved in the

26:24.971 --> 26:28.516
mechanics of coring. Emory and I wrote a paper 
about it, but in the Geological Society of America

26:29.738 --> 26:37.028
bulletin. But we developed snappers, but these 
were not new. Emory developed a sediment trap,

26:45.380 --> 26:52.930
which was a rather new device, and we designed 
dredges and learned something about the

26:53.602 --> 27:06.422
techniques of dredging and the amount of scope you 
put out and the proper way to develop a dredge. But

27:06.643 --> 27:11.170
we were developing dredges for collecting rocks, 
and this was quite new. There were dredges for

27:11.991 --> 27:20.284
collecting biological materials, and you always 
try to avoid rock with these, but we were going

27:11.991 --> 27:20.284
after the rock. So this was, this developing 
dredges was, but we didn't really develop

27:21.580 --> 27:32.080
anything new in the way of principles, we just

27:21.580 --> 27:32.080
put the equipment together.
