WEBVTT

00:02.140 --> 00:16.116
At that time, when you registered, you would go to a 
specific department and you could ask for a

00:02.140 --> 00:16.116
certain section if you knew who the instructor 
was. And I followed his advice on numerous

00:16.516 --> 00:21.322
occasions. Who were some of those, for you, some of 
those special first-year teachers? Oh, Dr. S.R.

00:27.849 --> 00:30.612
Gammon.

00:31.334 --> 00:51.448
head of the history department, and I majored in 
history, but I recall, and he said, he told me, he

00:31.334 --> 00:51.448
says, I had a B in 105,

00:31.334 --> 00:51.448
and he said, if you'll take this exam and make an A, 
you'll get an A in the course. And so I took him up on

00:52.069 --> 00:53.511
that. describe dr gammon as a lecturer he was great 
he came to texas a m to teach history as i remember as

00:54.976 --> 01:19.633
was told to me in the southern tradition and he had 
been a graduate of washington and lee and he he was a

00:54.976 --> 01:19.633
fine teacher and he was a little tough sometimes 
but if you responded by, you could make a good

01:20.812 --> 01:23.918
grade. I recall I went through with him through

01:24.018 --> 01:38.586
my senior year, and one letter quiz my senior year, 
and I believe it was U.S. Diplomatic History some

01:41.365 --> 01:58.294
like that i i didn't do very well particular quiz 
and he wrote me a little bit this is not of your

01:41.365 --> 01:58.294
quality and i i i took it part but he was a he was very 
good teach did he have a nickname i'm not heard one

01:41.365 --> 01:58.294
for him You have not? No. Oyster Joe. Oh, that's 
right. That's right. Yes, yes. Because of his

02:03.890 --> 02:10.810
habit of having peanuts in his mouth and clearing 
his throat and rolling them around. That's right.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.718
That's a special one. Now, his father, I've 
learned, was a great Presbyterian leader in

02:13.698 --> 02:29.662
Kentucky and Virginia, so that he came from a line 
of preacher teachers. He was great. I enjoyed him.

02:33.849 --> 02:34.490
I enjoyed him. All right. Other first-year 
teachers you remember with pride and gratitude?

02:41.643 --> 02:42.825
At A&M. For example, English. I'm trying to 
remember. I think it was Mr. Key, Mr. P.C. Key, that

02:52.785 --> 02:55.591
I had English. I never had my father. I remember 
that for sure. But I had Mr. Key and Mr. Gunter and

03:01.673 --> 03:08.704
Dr. Summey, who was head of the department. I 
enjoyed them. I think it must have been Mr. Key. And

03:12.750 --> 03:22.786
you know, it's changed now tremendously, but you 
had to write some compositions and so forth. And I

03:22.806 --> 03:30.077
was able to do pretty well under those 
instructors. I'm just trying to... I had Mr.

03:31.699 --> 03:34.043
Wolcott in Spanish. He was... Say, Jersey Joe? 
J.J. Wolcott was in the Modern Language

03:40.692 --> 03:49.585
Department, and his activity was also the singing 
cadets. He was one of their main directors way back

03:50.166 --> 03:53.631
there. And he taught...

03:59.774 --> 04:08.566
Spanish, and I took two years in college, and that 
second year when we got to having to read it, well, I

03:59.774 --> 04:08.566
didn't do as well as I should have done. Let's see, 
math, English, sciences? I

04:14.975 --> 04:20.082
had general science. The only thing I know, I don't 
remember those instructors. I just... um let's

04:31.415 --> 04:51.263
see political science what we now call polit and 
then it was government we didn't have it was uh

04:31.415 --> 04:51.263
government all in the uh history department 
department and uh of course the toughest teacher

04:31.415 --> 04:51.263
in the history department was dr uh dodson he 
taught British history. Oh, he was tough. He was

04:54.303 --> 04:55.265
really tough. Did he have a nickname? James Lingle 
Dodson is the only thing I remember. That was his

05:00.534 --> 05:02.959
name. But then another famous history prof was 
Screamin' Al Nelson. Was he there when you were a

05:10.177 --> 05:11.861
student? He taught Latin American history. I did 
not understand why that nickname was applied

05:15.549 --> 05:30.261
until I had a class across the hall from him I 
taught, and I heard him speak very loudly about his

05:15.549 --> 05:30.261
feelings about Franklin Roosevelt, and other 
communists, he said one day. And

05:33.222 --> 05:40.473
so I understood, let's see, was Horace Bass? Oh, 
Dr. Bass, I graded papers for Dr. Bass. Oh,

05:43.938 --> 05:46.401
describe working for him. He was a fine gentleman. 
And I recall I was introduced to him in one of,

05:48.565 --> 05:59.320
between my freshman and sophomore year, or 
sophomore and junior year, I was going to work at

06:00.515 --> 06:06.461
the job that I had and described. No, I was going to 
work for the registrar's office. That's what I was

06:10.044 --> 06:11.045
going to do. And play softball. And I was rudely 
detracted when I, in a softball game, I broke a

06:14.128 --> 06:23.297
collarbone. And so then it was time enough for me to 
go and register and take some courses. And I took

06:27.761 --> 06:29.543
some history electives. And Dr. Bass taught those 
that summer, and then later in my junior year, I

06:30.113 --> 06:42.812
graded some of his papers. You know, everybody had 
to take 306 Government, and it wasn't too

06:42.852 --> 06:54.349
difficult for a liberal arts major to grade an ag or 
engineering student's government paper. So I did

07:00.042 --> 07:03.365
that for him, and he was fine. He was fine. Do you 
remember what your compensation was as a grader

07:04.386 --> 07:07.509
then? Oh, I don't. I couldn't have been very much. 
Do you remember what the cost was for a year at A&M in

07:12.133 --> 07:17.078
those days? I do recall when I believe I registered 
the... Matriculation fee was $50 a semester, as I

07:25.278 --> 07:34.072
recall. And that meant you could take 16 to 18 hours 
of work. And then you lived at home, and so you had to

07:39.200 --> 07:43.347
buy your books. Books, uniform. And it's amazing. 
There would be no comparison to what you have for

07:50.705 --> 07:54.851
education today. Let's see. When did you decide 
that law was your calling? I had always wanted to

07:59.478 --> 08:06.108
take law, and I would read. In

08:07.490 --> 08:14.961
the 30s, there was a great deal written in the South 
about anti-lynching laws. And, of course, that

08:19.853 --> 08:27.944
was legislative in nature, and I just picked up on 
that and I said, well, I want to be a legislator. Of

08:28.004 --> 08:40.240
course, I never was, but I knew that if I had to take 
pre-law before you could go to law school, so I took

08:28.004 --> 08:40.240
liberal arts at A&M. Now, you were in the Corps, but 
you lived at home. Describe the Corps routine for

08:47.261 --> 08:54.209
you living at home. I participated in all of the 
military activities. I'd drill with my unit. I

09:01.597 --> 09:04.000
would report to the unit. a gun in the gun room that I 
had to keep clean, and I participated in the extra

09:04.469 --> 09:21.490
drills that the unit had, and completed all of 
those activities, you see. And I maintained and

09:21.510 --> 09:30.561
got a contract my junior year It

09:32.836 --> 09:50.027
meant that you would take advanced ROTC, and I 
received a contract and was on the course for

09:32.836 --> 09:50.027
reserve commission upon graduation. As a 
freshman, to what outfit were you assigned? F

09:53.673 --> 09:54.655
Coastal Artillery. What was their nickname? Had 
no nickname. Like they do, we had Coastal

09:58.352 --> 10:03.496
Artillery Regiment. There was an Artillery 
Regiment, Infantry Regiment, Composite

10:03.857 --> 10:10.603
Regiment, all of those. We had no Air Force, as is 
known today. It was much different. Were any of

10:16.228 --> 10:22.773
those Army branches higher in student prestige or 
lower? Which one was supposedly the choice? Well,

10:25.336 --> 10:25.776
okay. In the Coast Artillery Regiment, you had 
primarily engineers. In the infantry regiment,

10:33.011 --> 10:38.539
you had agricultural students. In the Signal 
Corps, you had electrical engineers, you see. And

10:44.128 --> 10:52.320
that was more or less, and you could ask for a 
specific, and I knew some, there was another local

10:44.128 --> 10:52.320
man in the, in the Coastal Artillery that I knew, 
C.A. Lewis, and I said, well, I'd like to go in

10:55.022 --> 10:57.685
there. And so you could request a preference, and 
they assigned me. Though I was really out of place

11:03.374 --> 11:06.639
when it came to the... Though I had to take college 
trigonometry to qualify, so I got through that,

11:06.659 --> 11:17.835
but I couldn't compete with the engineers. 
Describe, during that freshman year, describe

11:19.520 --> 11:27.092
the routine of a typical day, weekday.

11:29.336 --> 11:31.940
What time did things begin and what did you do? 
Well, you had an 8 to 5, or 8 to 12, 1 to 5. The whistle

11:38.450 --> 11:42.196
blew at 8 o'clock and it blew at 12, 1, and 5. And that 
was the schedule. As a freshman, you were, and they

11:47.633 --> 11:56.443
don't have that distinction now, we wore a little 
white stripe around our left sleeve. And you

11:58.065 --> 11:59.547
walked in the street. You didn't walk on the 
sidewalk. You didn't have any other privileges.

12:05.353 --> 12:08.797
But you went to class, see. And everybody was in 
uniform. And you had drills. once a week for two

12:18.380 --> 12:29.374
hours, and you would go to the armory and 
participate, whatever was on the training

12:18.380 --> 12:29.374
schedule. And 12

12:30.896 --> 12:41.850
noon whistle blows, everything stops, takes up at 
one o'clock, and terminates at five. Now did you

12:42.250 --> 12:47.577
drill with your outfit before they went to supper? 
If there were a scheduled drill, we'd have, we had

12:48.637 --> 13:03.894
special occasions like that where you'd have 
manual of arms drills and anything that was

12:48.637 --> 13:03.894
called. If you wanted to kind of hide out and not be 
found, where did you go? Everybody went to the

13:13.005 --> 13:15.167
YMCA. reading room or to the library.

13:21.387 --> 13:31.797
And I understand that

13:21.387 --> 13:31.797
by and large no one hazed anybody or harassed them 
in either of those places. No, that didn't occur.

13:35.760 --> 13:42.927
That in fact you could even kind of find a quiet 
place in the library and maybe take a brief nap. You

13:43.193 --> 13:43.733
could. The seats were hard, though, the chairs. 
Let's see. Did you eat many meals in the dining hall

13:50.179 --> 13:53.762
those first two years? No, sir. No, sir, I didn't. 
Did you ever take some buddies home for meals? Oh,

14:00.488 --> 14:01.489
yeah. On occasions, they would come over, and 
mostly they were study sessions.

14:10.737 --> 14:13.099
They would come over, and we would... I remember,

14:14.682 --> 14:28.478
well, they were all liberal arts, and you know, you 
would be in the same section for any number of

14:14.682 --> 14:28.478
different courses, you see. You'd have the same 
students would be in that section. Now, were there

14:32.603 --> 14:41.533
some courses that everybody kind of feared that 
were kind of tough, tough, tough courses, and

14:32.603 --> 14:41.533
everybody knew they were? Well, not for the 
liberal arts student as much as for the

14:43.522 --> 14:49.812
engineering students, you know. They had some 
tough courses. They had calculus, you know, and

14:52.636 --> 15:00.308
then they had some of the advanced engineering 
courses. I just hear them talk about it. Now, what

15:02.291 --> 15:04.074
math did you have to take? I went through 
trigonometry. So kind of a repeat of what you'd had

15:06.809 --> 15:10.254
in high school? In high school, it was. Who taught 
that? Do you remember? I think it must have been Mr.

15:14.039 --> 15:17.283
Lyle taught.

15:21.289 --> 15:25.875
All right, so your routine then as a sophomore did 
not change much. Did not change much. Then I went

15:27.578 --> 15:36.630
into the dormitory in my junior year, and...

15:37.623 --> 15:50.131
Then my senior year I was in the dorm, and I was 
elected editor of the battalion my senior year,

15:37.623 --> 15:50.131
and I had that particular duty to look after. Let's 
hold that, because I want to be sure to talk about

15:50.151 --> 15:56.425
that, but let's go back to the fall of 1939. the 
Aggies had a fairly good football team.

16:03.444 --> 16:14.656
Describe

16:03.444 --> 16:14.656
some of those star players as human beings.

16:14.716 --> 16:25.247
Well, the outstanding player was John Kimbrough, 
who developed in his sophomore year about the

16:14.716 --> 16:25.247
middle of the season He rose to the top. And so for 
the 1939

16:29.392 --> 16:38.924
year, he was the main show, and he was a terrific 
football player.

16:41.628 --> 16:46.554
On that same team were, well, Bama Smith, I saw him 
the other day. He was a senior on that team, as I

16:46.634 --> 16:51.100
recall. and he lives around here now, and did a 
whole lot to help beat Texas when they played over

16:51.839 --> 17:00.812
here that year, that fall. And then A&M later 
played in the Sugar Bowl against Tulane, and it was

17:01.774 --> 17:21.002
Cotton Price, the quarterback, and well, Pugh was 
the next year, and Thomason, the blocking back,

17:01.774 --> 17:21.002
Herbie Smith, Oh, there were quite a few of those 
guys. They were quite a team. Was Kimbrough

17:26.714 --> 17:31.802
respected as a fellow Aggie? Oh, yes. He was over in 
the infantry regiment along with his brother

17:32.603 --> 17:37.771
Jack. He played on that same team and all. And 
then...

17:47.560 --> 18:02.067
All of those men were, those players were in the 
Corps, though they lived maybe at one time in a

17:47.560 --> 18:02.067
special dorm. But then again, they went back to the 
Corps. They dissolved that athletic dormitory

18:05.493 --> 18:11.644
concept.

18:14.020 --> 18:21.907
But they were all true A&M men and did well. And did 
the athletes in that era, in your era, go to class

18:23.829 --> 18:28.373
and graduate? Oh, yeah. Except there was one, you 
know, there was a famous guard, Marshal Rob Nett.

18:37.902 --> 18:41.766
A&M at that time had what they called a

18:46.083 --> 18:55.722
what do they call, grade, not grade, well, you 
could end up with minus grade points if you didn't

18:46.083 --> 18:55.722
attend class. And he played for three years or four 
years, but he ended up with minus grade points. But

19:06.130 --> 19:08.673
that was just the nature of it. What about Coach 
Norton? Describe him. Coach Norton

19:14.360 --> 19:24.713
came way back in the middle 30s to lead A&M out of the 
wilderness, so to speak. And he brought Dick Todd

19:25.283 --> 19:30.388
with him, but that was before this big 39 team.

19:33.591 --> 19:42.459
Todd had completed in 38, I believe, and didn't 
play on the 39 team, but he was a great player. And

19:43.520 --> 19:47.183
Uncle Bill James was his line coach. Doe Rollins 
was an assistant coach. Manning Smith was the

19:49.766 --> 19:51.808
backfield coach. And... They put it all together 
in 39, and Coach Norton went to the Sugar Bowl, and

19:54.848 --> 20:07.643
then the next year we were going to go to the Rose 
Bowl, but we got sidetracked in Austin. I need that

20:08.324 --> 20:09.245
to happen. Yeah. Well, many of them were inducted 
into the service at the Cotton Bowl game in...

20:22.017 --> 20:29.526
where

20:22.017 --> 20:29.526
Kate Smith sang God Bless America. So a lot of those 
guys were inducted right there at the half. All

20:34.633 --> 20:35.834
right. As a freshman in 1939, that great team, do 
you remember going on court trip? Court trip? I

20:43.644 --> 20:46.287
remember going to the Sugar Bowl game. Oh, in 1940. 
Please describe that trip. That was a great trip. I

20:53.462 --> 21:03.738
was able to go and have a room with a friend of mine 
named Joe Orr, whose dad was in the CE department.

21:03.758 --> 21:10.268
And little Joe and I went down there, and I got him a 
ticket, and he got me a place to stay, and we had a

21:03.758 --> 21:10.268
great time. That was the greatest football game 
I've ever seen. How did you all get there? We got

21:14.178 --> 21:15.460
there on the train. That was the only way you could 
go. And, well, you could drive and all, but most

21:17.022 --> 21:22.229
people traveled by train. And, of course, life in 
the French Quarter in celebration of New Year's is

21:22.970 --> 21:32.863
quite an occasion, too. You know, it's 
wall-to-wall on Canal Street, and that was quite

21:32.903 --> 21:41.434
an experience, too. The football game was 
probably the best one that I have ever seen.

21:45.512 --> 21:55.944
Kimbrough and Price beat Kellogg and McCollum, 
who were all Americans for Tulane, 14 to 13. And

21:57.125 --> 22:00.910
that's where, that's made A&M football. And then 
the next year, it was going to be even greater, but

22:01.471 --> 22:10.982
naturally the war was developing and all, and a lot 
of those guys, well, they still, they dropped out

22:11.198 --> 22:33.609
and then actually, going back to Jimmy Cashin, he 
was in the kiddie corps that Norton coached

22:11.198 --> 22:33.609
probably in the years 44

22:11.198 --> 22:33.609
and 45, maybe 43, I don't know. But Jimmy was in 
school then and he played quarterback for for

22:40.426 --> 22:41.568
Norton then. And, well, of course, when you think 
about, there's only one thing to think about now is

22:44.012 --> 22:54.549
when and how were you going. A lot of guys would 
leave A&M at the end of the sophomore year and go

22:54.629 --> 23:01.840
into the service. And one of the primary places 
they would go would be to, it took two semesters of

23:07.966 --> 23:11.752
college work to get into the flying program. And a 
lot of guys would go then, and then if they didn't do

23:12.613 --> 23:19.763
well in school, they would, you know, the other 
opportunity was to go into the service. And we were

23:20.525 --> 23:31.941
inducted, or my class was inducted, because we 
went to school in the summer of 42, and graduated in

23:20.525 --> 23:31.941
January of 43. We were wholesale, the whole class 
took a special train from Bryan, our college

23:38.611 --> 23:55.911
station, to Houston to be inducted in the 
inducting schedule and then came back and

23:38.611 --> 23:55.911
graduated and then were called to active duties as 
enlisted personnel and then we all went to OCS and

23:56.937 --> 24:01.122
then got our commissions. Let's back up to 
December 7, 1941. Where were you and how did you

24:05.968 --> 24:10.093
hear what had happened at Pearl Harbor? It was a 
Sunday afternoon, and I remember it was a nice day

24:11.595 --> 24:25.172
and all, and the word came out, okay, and of course, 
that what had happened, you know, came by radio.

24:26.266 --> 24:28.529
Everybody said, well, let's go. And some of them 
sure left at that time. Do you remember anybody

24:34.578 --> 24:42.911
having any reservation about what the United 
States should do? Oh, there was no reservation

24:43.612 --> 24:46.236
about it. And in the Cadet Corps, well, you know, 
well, do I go now or do I wait? And most of them,

24:54.295 --> 24:57.338
naturally, waited. But quite a few just left. Did 
your parents have any words for you that you

24:58.959 --> 25:03.224
remember right at that point? Nothing. They knew I 
was part of it, and they couldn't control it. So you

25:07.868 --> 25:13.774
were, this is your third year, the fall of your? 
Fall of 41. So if you started 39, then the fall of 40?

25:20.400 --> 25:20.921
42. I remember the class of 42. They went 
wholesale. Then I was the next class. So you were

25:29.047 --> 25:30.189
the class of 43. And when did y'all learn that the 
four-year routine was going to be shortened? I

25:44.144 --> 25:48.349
guess in the spring of 42.

25:50.000 --> 26:02.803
And the college went on full time around the clock, 
and they had no facilities to go to summer camp. So

26:03.805 --> 26:11.198
that meant that the only thing you could do would be 
to go to school, and then they didn't know what

26:03.805 --> 26:11.198
would happen thereafter. That's what happened. 
We went to school. All right, and you were living on

26:14.536 --> 26:18.841
campus then as a junior. I was living in the 
dormitory, and I was editor of the battalion for

26:19.122 --> 26:28.474
the summer of 42 and the fall of 43. Describe 
what... There was very little going on. Your

26:33.400 --> 26:34.742
battalion... In the summer. Oh, the battalion? 
Yes. It was interesting. We had...

26:42.616 --> 26:47.506
three issues a week, Tuesday, Thursday, 
Saturday. I believe, yeah, we had three issues a

26:47.526 --> 26:51.734
week. We were under supervision of the Student 
Activities Office, and it was pretty hard

26:51.754 --> 27:02.295
sometimes to fill out with newsprint, you know. 
Who was the key individual advisor? Or the key

27:09.701 --> 27:14.827
person that you... Well, that's a good question 
there. I think Mr. Angel was the assistant to the

27:14.847 --> 27:20.213
president. Is this Charlie Angel? E.L. Angel. Oh. 
And he had... the student activities supervisor

27:29.950 --> 27:41.366
was Mr.

27:29.950 --> 27:41.366
Boone,

27:29.950 --> 27:41.366
I think. He had the actual hands-on. But Mr. Angel 
was the administrative overseer, you might say.

27:54.244 --> 27:57.308
And we had a lot of Well, there wasn't a whole lot of 
activity because then you were locked in then. By

28:06.678 --> 28:09.523
that time, you couldn't travel. There was not much 
athletic activity in the summer, and I remember my

28:10.786 --> 28:19.363
sports editor was Mike Hyken. And he made a 
mountain out of a molehill by writing up every

28:21.048 --> 28:27.338
softball game that occurred on the campus. That's 
what he did to cover sports, because there wasn't

28:28.119 --> 28:34.149
anything until the fall, and football came. We 
still had a football season and all. But we went to

28:37.133 --> 28:43.984
school, wore the uniform, and that was a little 
unusual for that summer. How were you selected as

28:44.960 --> 28:47.524
the editor? I was the student body. Okay. And was 
there any compensation at all other than

28:52.292 --> 28:56.819
satisfaction? $55 a month. I believe that's what 
it was. And where was the battalion located,

29:01.828 --> 29:04.332
quartered? In the basement of the administration 
building. Because the press, the... N.M. Press

29:12.820 --> 29:17.789
was in the north end of that basement building. And 
just down the other, in the south hall, was the

29:19.272 --> 29:23.901
student activities office. About where did the 
battalion circulate? Primarily to the

29:29.652 --> 29:35.723
dormitories and the faculty. and then some mail 
outs to selected, I think each staff member had two

29:36.563 --> 29:47.633
subscriptions that they could send. Did you ever 
publish anything that was close to being

29:47.653 --> 29:56.661
questionable by any reviewer? Oh yes, I remember 
during my,

30:07.107 --> 30:08.690
services, the editor. There was a

30:09.952 --> 30:19.146
monthly magazine of feature stories, and it had a 
different editor. John Holman was the managing

30:19.888 --> 30:22.592
editor of that. And it had jokes in it. And we would 
take selected jokes from other magazines, other

30:35.086 --> 30:42.398
student publications across the country. And as I 
recall, Mr. Angel reviewed one of those

30:42.418 --> 30:55.080
magazines,

30:42.418 --> 30:55.080
and he questioned me about the quality of the 
jokes. Maybe he said they were too off color. And I

31:01.225 --> 31:04.112
said, well, I'm going to go along with the managing 
editor. He thinks they're all right. But the next

31:06.637 --> 31:15.117
thing I knew, that that whole addition, before it 
was bound and cut, was on the garbage.
