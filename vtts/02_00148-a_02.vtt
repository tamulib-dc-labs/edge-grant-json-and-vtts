WEBVTT

00:03.946 --> 00:13.417
So to get these tolerances on the concrete, they were just charging the moon, because if a man is responsible, they have to prepare for the worst.

00:14.298 --> 00:21.787
Well, there was a clever man on one of the bidders who said, heck with the tolerances.

00:22.028 --> 00:24.891
I'm just going to lay these things out together out in the field here.

00:25.732 --> 00:30.517
put one piece in, then the next piece in, it's going to fit, and he laid the whole thing out in the field.

00:30.577 --> 00:34.661
He came in way under, bit everybody else, and saved us a lot of money.

00:34.721 --> 00:38.064
Then he just picked them up out of the field and put them in the building.

00:38.264 --> 00:39.205
And it worked.

00:39.225 --> 00:39.605
Oh, sure.

00:39.846 --> 00:42.748
I mean, if they fit together out in the field, they're going to fit together in the building.

00:44.270 --> 00:47.473
So we saved quite a bit of money there.

00:47.493 --> 00:51.857
Now, another place we saved a lot of money, the Welch Foundation,

00:53.339 --> 00:55.761
gave us a million dollars, and it went in the bank.

00:55.921 --> 00:59.284
Well, it took us four years to build this thing.

00:59.304 --> 01:05.369
So we were accumulating money, and the Welsh Foundation money was set aside for research equipment.

01:06.930 --> 01:11.494
And so we had more money for research equipment than we knew what to do with.

01:11.514 --> 01:19.481
We kept buying another magnet, and some more money would show up, and we'd buy another source, and well, we didn't have any problem with money.

01:20.482 --> 01:22.924
Also, the AEC, which supported us,

01:23.647 --> 01:35.040
in operations after it was built always gave us plenty of money because the state of Texas gave us several hundred million every year.

01:35.100 --> 01:44.610
And the AEC said, well, every time we put a million dollars in or a dollar into the Texas A&M, we get $2 million in research.

01:45.672 --> 01:51.358
So that was extremely important that the state of Texas continued to provide operation funds.

01:51.541 --> 01:55.606
And that money came through the coordinating board, or what?

01:55.626 --> 01:56.327
The state money?

01:56.427 --> 01:59.191
Or was it just a line item to the end?

01:59.251 --> 02:00.533
I think it was a line item.

02:00.553 --> 02:03.376
I suppose Texas got it for their Van de Graaff, too.

02:03.456 --> 02:03.897
I don't know.

02:03.937 --> 02:18.656
What other institutions in the United States, at the time our facility was finished, what other colleges or universities had similar facilities, similar cyclotrons?

02:20.398 --> 02:20.839
Well,

02:21.933 --> 02:23.835
It was the biggest one around at the time.

02:25.197 --> 02:46.202
And the ironical thing is that ten years later when they, you know, they have to shut things down, Texas got shut down, Rice got shut down, because they were earlier than we were and we're still going, even though at the beginning we didn't have anything and they had everything.

02:46.874 --> 02:49.398
So, they're out of nuclear physics.

02:49.578 --> 02:51.481
Because their machine was outdated?

02:51.521 --> 02:53.083
Yeah, they get obsolete.

02:53.624 --> 02:55.106
I mean, the new machines come out.

02:56.047 --> 02:56.147
Okay.

02:56.167 --> 02:59.652
But, let's use the word competitive.

02:59.712 --> 03:04.199
We were competing with what other universities?

03:04.219 --> 03:14.113
Well, those, Princeton had a small cyclotron, but you see, that's the reason they wanted to get that three million dollars.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.903
Maryland had a small cyclotron.

03:16.923 --> 03:27.454
So essentially those 23 universities, Notre Dame, Indiana, Purdue, I don't remember them all, all had, they were all nuclear physics.

03:27.474 --> 03:28.576
They could write proposals.

03:29.897 --> 03:32.961
Minnesota, I think, Michigan.

03:33.621 --> 03:41.350
The fact that they could write proposals meant they had nuclear physicists doing research.

03:41.971 --> 03:49.667
But what's happening is their machines are becoming obsolete, and they were knocked out of business when this great big cyclotron came along that we got.

03:52.533 --> 03:59.247
And the research funding came generally from whom?

03:59.267 --> 04:03.355
Well, the Atomic Energy Commission and the state of Texas.

04:03.942 --> 04:06.387
None from any private corporations?

04:06.848 --> 04:07.609
I don't believe so.

04:07.990 --> 04:09.153
Okay.

04:09.173 --> 04:11.998
So, has that been true down through the years?

04:12.058 --> 04:16.868
Has the AEC been the primary?

04:17.429 --> 04:20.596
Well, it's National Science Foundation now, I think.

04:20.616 --> 04:23.301
I left the cyclotron in 1970, so.

04:23.787 --> 04:26.250
After that, I'm kind of out of touch.

04:26.871 --> 04:35.221
All right, and so it begins in 67, and some graduate students start recruiting some graduate students.

04:35.721 --> 04:36.002
Yeah.

04:37.063 --> 04:39.726
Well, then the next big milestone is that Rudder died.

04:40.327 --> 04:42.129
You probably know the year that happens.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.150
It's the spring of 1970.

04:43.511 --> 04:43.611
Okay.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.495
Well, within four months, I was fired.

04:49.378 --> 04:53.102
Andy Suttle was putting, well, he was always the director.

04:53.926 --> 04:58.472
But none of the other research people would take my position.

04:59.573 --> 05:04.139
So he had to put the chief engineer in charge.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.704
And what reason were you given for this?

05:09.425 --> 05:10.827
I was incompetent.

05:10.847 --> 05:12.008
And who made that decision?

05:12.048 --> 05:12.329
Subtle?

05:12.569 --> 05:14.131
Yeah.

05:14.191 --> 05:21.119
I asked him to, well, that's some of the documentation I was telling you about.

05:21.159 --> 05:23.342
I don't know whether you want any of that or not.

05:23.913 --> 05:26.356
I have his letter and my response.

05:27.817 --> 05:29.239
All right, let me turn it off.

05:29.459 --> 05:38.489
Well, I don't like to watch any women in public, but I've got a letter from Martell and Plas saying, you know, how they were against it.

05:38.930 --> 05:41.513
I've got a letter from Berkeley saying this is ridiculous.

05:42.894 --> 05:45.998
When did Gil Plas come as the new department head?

05:48.681 --> 05:50.363
Well, that's when all the people were leaving.

05:50.763 --> 05:52.485
Late 60s?

05:53.225 --> 05:56.429
late 60s, because he was there at the time.

05:57.670 --> 06:12.769
See, when I go left, and then Squire, he was in a continual fight with Subtle, which saved me, because I was, they were shooting at, I was in the trench and they were shooting at each other.

06:14.010 --> 06:18.275
And Squire left before Subtle, I believe.

06:19.336 --> 06:23.181
Then Gammill, he got disgusted with all the fighting, so he left.

06:24.157 --> 06:27.421
Now, he was a faculty member.

06:27.441 --> 06:30.544
Yeah, he was a very good theoretical physicist from Los Alamos.

06:31.605 --> 06:36.050
And Potter left because they just pushed him down.

06:37.451 --> 06:38.352
And Eisner left.

06:38.693 --> 06:42.257
Describe Dr. Plass as the department head.

06:43.078 --> 06:48.804
Well, that's interesting because I was more or less responsible for getting him here.

06:48.904 --> 06:52.628
He and I ate at the same rooming house.

06:53.114 --> 06:54.596
boarding house in Princeton.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.962
He was a graduate student at Princeton when I was there.

06:59.484 --> 07:01.768
And Madeline was there, too.

07:01.788 --> 07:02.650
We all knew each other.

07:04.473 --> 07:12.887
So, well, what brought it to a head was when Zener became the new dean.

07:14.309 --> 07:19.257
And when everybody was out of town in August, he appointed Squire, head of the department.

07:20.553 --> 07:25.498
And the first thing we got from Squire was a memo that we had to be at work at 8 o'clock in the morning.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.041
I wish I'd saved that memo.

07:28.061 --> 07:29.362
I just threw it in the wastebasket.

07:30.303 --> 07:35.169
But everybody marched into Rudder's office and said, this is impossible.

07:36.030 --> 07:40.374
And Rudder, I remember asking Zener, did you do that?

07:40.594 --> 07:41.676
And he said, yes, I did.

07:42.797 --> 07:44.018
Zener was an honest guy.

07:44.919 --> 07:49.564
But from then on, essentially the department was run

07:51.923 --> 07:53.425
I don't think Rudder got involved.

07:53.505 --> 07:55.368
That closed probably Hall.

07:55.468 --> 07:58.612
We went to Halls once a month or something.

07:59.633 --> 08:03.959
And essentially they just ignored Squire.

08:05.481 --> 08:08.105
And Zener was still, people liked Zener.

08:08.505 --> 08:11.349
He was a decent guy.

08:11.409 --> 08:16.716
He just didn't have much sense when he put Squire in there without asking anybody.

08:17.540 --> 08:23.008
Well, anyway, that accounts for six of the people with full professorships who left.

08:23.889 --> 08:30.819
So, we needed a new department head, and that's when I thought of Gil Klotz.

08:31.720 --> 08:40.373
He was at the University of Texas in Dallas, and he was a very good physicist.

08:41.034 --> 08:41.995
His specialty.

08:42.987 --> 08:52.538
When he was in atmospheric physics, he was one of the first who recognized carbon dioxide could be a problem, the greenhouse effect.

08:52.558 --> 09:01.369
He did his research at, or after he left Princeton, he was at Johns Hopkins and wrote some papers about the greenhouse effect back there.

09:03.791 --> 09:12.141
So he was in atmospheric physics and very well thought, well I knew him, he was a smart guy.

09:12.321 --> 09:12.842
In fact,

09:14.257 --> 09:24.939
He had the misfortune when he was a graduate student at Princeton with me to follow Richard Feynman.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.662
I don't know if you've heard of Feynman or not.

09:27.143 --> 09:34.037
Well, he's considered one of the five greatest physicists in our generation.

09:34.490 --> 09:43.142
He was Wheeler's first graduate student, and Gil Plas was the second graduate student.

09:43.162 --> 09:49.812
And they were working on some, his research was picking up, expanding on what Feynman had done.

09:50.833 --> 09:58.364
Well anyway, so I knew a lot about him, and I knew what he did, and I knew him personally, he was a very decent guy.

09:59.326 --> 10:01.729
So we were delighted when he came.

10:02.080 --> 10:06.403
and he brought chaos into

10:06.620 --> 10:11.486
Well, before he came, we never had an appointments or promotions committee.

10:11.606 --> 10:13.548
The department had, you know, he's the head.

10:13.588 --> 10:15.770
I mean, the head of the head.

10:15.790 --> 10:20.836
It was, you know, it's the Army, and you don't have a committee.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.239
I guess even in the Army you have committees.

10:23.479 --> 10:33.150
So anyhow, PLOS started to make our department more like departments that weren't Army bases like they are here.

10:33.687 --> 10:38.874
And, well, he just kind of made the transition to the new world.

10:40.856 --> 10:46.704
Mr. Rudder dies, and within a few months, Jack Williams is the new president.

10:46.904 --> 10:50.388
Thank goodness, yeah, because Ludicke was behind this business.

10:51.470 --> 10:58.699
And from what I've heard, it was a four to three vote that Williams won over Ludicke.

10:59.489 --> 11:00.851
in the board of directors.

11:00.951 --> 11:01.892
That's what I've heard.

11:02.072 --> 11:04.555
I have no independent information.

11:06.438 --> 11:14.088
And so that knocked, I mean, subtle left within a couple of weeks after that.

11:14.428 --> 11:15.710
His mentor was gone.

11:16.751 --> 11:26.323
And then they appointed Sugihara, who was a chemistry professor to be head of the cyclotron.

11:26.962 --> 11:28.344
And we were all happy with that.

11:28.844 --> 11:34.931
I mean, every cyclotron or Van de Graaff in the country is run by academic people.

11:36.012 --> 11:44.922
This was the only one that was run by a vice president of research who had no sympathy for the academic people and wasn't an academic person himself at all.

11:45.763 --> 11:56.074
Now, on paper, the budget for the cyclotron was administered by the dean or the vice president early on?

11:56.695 --> 11:57.937
Well, it went through Subtle.

11:59.139 --> 12:01.583
Subtle interacted with the Atomic Energy Commission.

12:02.044 --> 12:18.791
The Atomic Energy Commission would send some people down once a year when we presented the budget, and we always met for dinner and then went to Subtle's apartment and talked about, you know, just personal relationships.

12:18.811 --> 12:22.517
And I went to Washington with Subtle a couple of times.

12:23.611 --> 12:27.035
So he represented the university on the cyclotron.

12:29.597 --> 12:37.466
Looking back on those first years, are there any other people that you now think of deserve a pat on the back that hasn't been mentioned?

12:40.409 --> 12:50.800
Well, I mentioned, I mentioned Squire and I mentioned Hall and Potter and Plus, they were the important people.

12:50.864 --> 12:56.992
there weren't any former students of A&M, there weren't any board members that were key?

12:59.976 --> 13:01.938
No, let me tell you one thing about the board.

13:02.659 --> 13:14.134
When we had to get started, we needed some kind of an estimate of how much money we were going to spend for the cyclotron and how much for the building and how much for the shielding.

13:14.875 --> 13:20.702
So we hired a company in Berkeley, where they knew how to build cyclotrons, and they

13:20.750 --> 13:27.385
made an estimate of, for $50,000, they wrote up a little proposal of what's involved in building the cyclotron.

13:28.247 --> 13:36.987
So then when the time came to build the cyclotron, we went out for bids, and these people said, well, you can't go out for bids.

13:37.709 --> 13:39.031
You know, we're involved now.

13:39.071 --> 13:40.954
We're the ones who should build this cyclotron.

13:43.697 --> 13:46.722
Well, they thought the board was a bunch of hayseeds who didn't know anything.

13:46.762 --> 13:49.726
They didn't know they ran oil companies and things like that.

13:50.607 --> 13:54.393
And so somebody on the board said, who paid for that proposal?

13:56.335 --> 13:57.277
Well, I guess you did.

13:57.597 --> 13:58.999
Well, whose proposal is that?

13:59.840 --> 14:02.684
Well, it is Texas A&M's proposal.

14:03.385 --> 14:06.670
Then what have you got to say about what we do from now on?

14:06.987 --> 14:08.168
And they wouldn't even let them bid.

14:10.892 --> 14:14.656
So the board, well, I got the impression it was a pretty confident board.

14:15.157 --> 14:16.879
They had some really good people, I guess.

14:17.520 --> 14:33.118
Who was the man from, he was vice president of some, it wasn't Bechtel, it was some other, anyhow, Evans was clearly a very good guy.

14:33.559 --> 14:36.943
And the other man, it wasn't Boydell, was it?

14:37.075 --> 14:38.537
Boydell was from Dow Chemical.

14:38.657 --> 14:39.078
Okay.

14:39.518 --> 14:41.221
Well, he, you know, he... A.P.

14:41.261 --> 14:41.601
Boydell.

14:41.681 --> 14:42.002
B-E-T-E-M.

14:42.022 --> 14:43.283
The vice president or something.

14:43.343 --> 14:51.154
I mean, for these little company from Berkeley to tell this guy how he should run his business didn't go over very well.

14:51.795 --> 14:55.540
No, they had some... And Squire, when he...

14:56.414 --> 14:57.115
recruited me.

14:57.135 --> 14:59.738
He made a point of the qualifications of the board.

15:02.661 --> 15:02.761
Yeah.

15:02.781 --> 15:04.764
Then Williams comes in.

15:04.804 --> 15:08.208
Did you all have any direct interrelations with him?

15:09.429 --> 15:13.534
No, things got to be more like an academic place.

15:14.074 --> 15:21.182
And they got the new head of the cyclotron.

15:21.262 --> 15:23.485
He was a member of the chemistry department.

15:23.819 --> 15:26.462
So the cyclotron was now in the College of Science.

15:26.482 --> 15:27.984
It wasn't off there all by itself.

15:29.025 --> 15:31.809
And... On paper, it reported to the dean?

15:33.251 --> 15:34.392
Yeah.

15:34.412 --> 15:35.493
I think, yeah, that's right.

15:36.114 --> 15:44.464
They... Yeah, I think the director of the cyclotron probably reported to the dean, just like the heads of the departments reported to the dean.

15:44.544 --> 15:50.752
But as I said, I wasn't involved then, so I... Now, did you continue to do research at the cyclotron?

15:50.772 --> 15:53.235
No, I decided in about 1970,

15:54.076 --> 15:57.901
And the Korean War was winding down.

16:00.144 --> 16:09.477
Boeing in Seattle had fired 30,000 engineers, or 30,000 people, and suddenly the jobs just weren't there.

16:09.537 --> 16:16.106
If you look at our department now, I guess half the department's between 60 and 65.

16:17.027 --> 16:20.792
They were the ones who I had a lot to do with hiring them.

16:21.700 --> 16:26.726
Well, for those guys, there was plenty of jobs, because we were hiring, and so were a lot of other people.

16:28.067 --> 16:46.268
Well, that hiring ended about 1970, and so I decided that since I had tenure, now that they did have tenure, that I don't know whether Williams or Rudder had agreed to the AAUP standards.

16:46.648 --> 16:47.810
I think it's Rudder.

16:47.830 --> 16:49.952
Yeah.

16:50.118 --> 16:52.440
For the first time, I decided tenure was a good thing.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.342
Up until then, it really didn't make much difference.

16:55.463 --> 16:58.266
So I thought, well, I'll get into nuclear medicine.

16:58.906 --> 17:00.928
I mean, people are going to die forever.

17:01.509 --> 17:05.813
It's always going to be business for people in nuclear medicine.

17:06.553 --> 17:12.119
So I moved back to the physics department and had space in the physics department.

17:12.979 --> 17:19.045
And with POS being the head of the department, it was convenient for me to do that.

17:19.396 --> 17:25.103
And so I began to have graduate students in the physics department.

17:25.123 --> 17:31.390
All right, as that new routine for you begins, describe a typical work day.

17:31.550 --> 17:32.912
What time did you get there?

17:32.972 --> 17:34.093
What happened when?

17:35.735 --> 17:44.185
Oh, well, probably my teaching, but that point was teaching engineers or pre-meds.

17:44.405 --> 17:48.610
Those are our two big, two big clientels.

17:49.079 --> 17:56.299
I think there's ten professors teaching engineers right now, because all the engineers have to take physics.

17:57.783 --> 18:04.422
So I was teaching elementary physics, and I enjoy that if I've got to

18:04.857 --> 18:10.126
prepare a lecture, I might as well have 100 people listening instead of 10.

18:10.727 --> 18:12.851
These would be what classification?

18:12.871 --> 18:13.772
Junior, seniors?

18:14.193 --> 18:15.395
No, these would be freshmen.

18:15.435 --> 18:18.300
This is their first introduction to physics.

18:19.062 --> 18:25.633
And we found out that the people who had not had high school physics did better than the ones who had.

18:26.525 --> 18:30.190
Part of that may be what they call the sophomore slump at Yale.

18:31.571 --> 18:37.319
They had students coming from the public schools and students coming from the private schools, and they had about 50-50.

18:37.479 --> 18:42.846
In the first year, the kids from the private schools had a great time.

18:44.068 --> 18:45.289
It wasn't all that difficult.

18:45.329 --> 18:46.511
They'd seen it all before.

18:46.531 --> 18:50.676
The public school kids were really scratching to keep up.

18:51.331 --> 18:55.057
But then the sophomore year came along and they had what they called a sophomore slump.

18:56.379 --> 19:03.209
That was when the private school kids realized they didn't know everything anymore and they'd forgotten how to study.

19:03.990 --> 19:06.193
Well, it was something like that here, I think.

19:06.914 --> 19:08.817
They'd had some high school physics.

19:09.623 --> 19:14.008
Which goes a ways, but it doesn't go nearly as far as our introductory physics.

19:14.028 --> 19:18.814
And they'd wake up after about their second exam, which they'd flunked, but they had to start studying.

19:19.375 --> 19:25.742
And so that's, I'm sure, cause that, I don't want to say the high school teachers aren't good, because I think they are.

19:26.724 --> 19:28.686
But anyway.

19:32.170 --> 19:34.493
So you'd get to the campus about what time?

19:34.513 --> 19:36.255
So anyhow, well,

19:37.265 --> 19:46.259
Oftentimes I'd have an 8 o'clock class on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and the department was nice, they'd also give me a 10 o'clock class.

19:46.299 --> 19:53.010
We had to teach at least two classes, and it would be the same introductory physics.

19:53.070 --> 19:59.099
So I didn't have to work, well I always figured about 50 percent of my time was teaching.

20:00.501 --> 20:01.062
You have to

20:01.193 --> 20:02.094
grade papers.

20:02.454 --> 20:04.817
And, well, I didn't give any homework.

20:04.917 --> 20:05.798
I mean, it was up to them.

20:05.858 --> 20:07.200
And then they took exams.

20:08.581 --> 20:13.347
And fortunately, in physics, you can write exams that the computer can grade because there's answers.

20:14.528 --> 20:19.333
And if you can't do the problem, well, they have a 20% chance of guessing the right answer.

20:19.994 --> 20:24.439
But now in 1970, we didn't, we weren't yet doing them on the computer.

20:24.459 --> 20:25.820
Well, the physics department was.

20:26.161 --> 20:26.701
Oh, really?

20:26.721 --> 20:28.744
See, we have people who know how to use computers.

20:29.184 --> 20:29.324
Okay.

20:29.464 --> 20:30.846
So we'd hire somebody.

20:31.163 --> 20:35.168
But no, later on, the university did it, and that was much nicer.

20:36.049 --> 20:44.358
Did you have, when you, the first class meeting, what were the guidelines that you laid out for those students?

20:44.398 --> 20:47.362
What did you tell them to do or not to do?

20:48.503 --> 20:55.050
Well, the first thing I'd tell them is that for an engineer, physics is like English is to a journalist.

20:55.651 --> 21:00.917
I mean, you can't even do what you're interested in doing unless you know how to do physics.

21:01.100 --> 21:09.152
And I found it was much more pleasant to teach engineers, who were not as smart, than to teach the pre-meds, who were very smart.

21:09.974 --> 21:15.843
Because the pre-meds just wanted to get a grade, and the engineers, they were more relaxed.

21:15.883 --> 21:17.665
If they got a B, it didn't affect their lives.

21:18.407 --> 21:23.935
If a pre-med got a B, might not go to medical school, because they're so competitive that

21:24.235 --> 21:27.738
if you get a bee anywhere, why, it could rule you out.

21:28.679 --> 21:33.064
So that first thing was to encourage them that it was important.

21:33.944 --> 21:52.943
And then I always use the, we have very good textbooks, I always use the textbooks as a set of notes, and I'd say don't take a lot of notes, it's all in the book, and then I'd give my own version and tell some stories and do some problems on the board.

21:53.345 --> 21:59.995
but everything they needed to know was in the book, and then there was a whole lot of problems in the book, and they were assigned problems.

22:00.015 --> 22:01.898
Did you check roll?

22:01.938 --> 22:05.142
Did you tolerate their being absent as much as they wanted to?

22:05.263 --> 22:21.006
Yeah, because, well, part of it, they were tested on the exam, and in the exam they'd get some problems, but they were never exactly the problems in the book, but they were similar.

22:21.408 --> 22:23.871
If they didn't understand it, they couldn't do the test.

22:24.012 --> 22:27.637
And I always had four versions of the test out there.

22:28.578 --> 22:31.983
So they could work at it and cheat if they could.

22:32.023 --> 22:35.688
And the Corps is the worst bunch of cheaters I ever saw.

22:36.349 --> 22:45.221
In fact, when the women got here, for the first time in my experience, they'd come up and say, that guy over there was copying my paper.

22:45.682 --> 22:47.044
The Corps would never do that.

22:47.767 --> 22:54.095
And maybe that's good, if you're going to have an army, you've got to have guys who go down to the wire with each other.

22:54.796 --> 22:59.021
You didn't have many women in classes in the 70s, did you?

22:59.241 --> 23:02.866
No, you mentioned the woman who was here back in the 20s.

23:03.927 --> 23:11.597
I remember when the women first came, and I remember one class, there were two women, and all the rest were men.

23:11.948 --> 23:17.235
The two women were sitting next to each other, and there was an empty seat all the way around.

23:17.255 --> 23:24.183
These men were scared to death of them because, or at least traditionally, if you were talking to the girls, everybody whistled.

23:25.425 --> 23:30.611
And the girls, well, they raised the standards way up.

23:31.492 --> 23:32.033
I mean,

23:32.013 --> 23:36.037
The Corps of Cadets is not very friendly to academic work.

23:36.137 --> 23:43.965
I knew one guy who quit the Corps because before the exam, they took him out at 4 o'clock in the morning and marched him.

23:44.766 --> 23:46.588
And of course, he did terrible on the exam.

23:46.628 --> 23:48.290
He worked very hard to get a good grade.

23:49.211 --> 23:52.554
And so he said, to heck with his Corps, I want to learn, I want to be an engineer.

23:55.237 --> 24:00.062
So because of things like that, the grades before the girls came were not too good.

24:00.616 --> 24:12.428
and you know better than I do probably, my recollection is that the girls' dorms were always, all of them, above any of the boys' dorms or something like that, or any of the core dorms.

24:12.748 --> 24:20.596
Did you grade on the curve, or did you have a certain, if you make a certain grade, you get a, you get that grade?

24:21.077 --> 24:30.066
Well, yeah, you had to, if they, yeah, they know that if you get a 90, you should get an A if you get, but then,

24:30.670 --> 24:39.503
The trick is to write exams so that not many people get above 90s and not many get above 80s.

24:40.264 --> 24:43.969
So at the end, then you're very liberal and you give everybody above 86 and 8.

24:44.670 --> 24:47.795
And then everybody's happy, except during the whole semester, they're unhappy.

24:48.456 --> 24:55.446
And when they write their evaluation of the faculty member, you probably take a beating, I don't know.

24:55.730 --> 25:04.389
What are some of the marvelous excuses you remember students offering for some problem they had or their absence?

25:04.409 --> 25:10.162
Do you remember any creative, made-up excuses some student had?

25:11.304 --> 25:14.852
Well, since they weren't required to come,

25:15.305 --> 25:19.169
But for the reason they missed the test, or why they ought to get makeup?

25:19.429 --> 25:29.140
Well, some of them would come puffing in halfway through the test, and my motorcycle broke down, or something like that, or the bus system.

25:29.901 --> 25:32.163
But most of them showed up for the test.

25:32.584 --> 25:35.327
And that was one advantage of having two classes.

25:35.427 --> 25:40.352
If they got in late for the first test, I'd say, OK, come in and take the next test.

25:40.793 --> 25:42.915
And it's a lot of work to write a test.

25:43.385 --> 25:55.717
Did you ever have a parent or an important former student or politician ever try to intervene in a grade that you were giving to a student?

25:56.717 --> 25:56.938
No.

25:57.238 --> 26:00.581
Nobody ever asked you to reconsider?

26:00.621 --> 26:05.386
I've not heard of that, but I've— Yeah.

26:05.406 --> 26:07.688
No, the students usually pleaded their own case.

26:08.609 --> 26:13.273
I had a Vietnamese who had to commute from Houston.

26:13.962 --> 26:18.448
And I budged the limit a little bit to get him over a C level or something.

26:19.850 --> 26:31.305
I think I had one black guy who I budged the limit to get him a C, and then he wanted to get a B. I threw him out of the office.

26:31.325 --> 26:38.154
But I did meet the parent of one girl, and the black girls could get As.

26:38.494 --> 26:41.438
The black boys, I don't know, C was their limit.

26:42.447 --> 26:50.439
And her mother was a schoolteacher, as you might have expected, and she was happy that I was nice to her daughter and all that.

26:51.260 --> 26:58.191
As far as you observed, how was racial integration, how did it go here?

26:58.431 --> 27:03.458
Do you remember any problems that black students had in class or in the hallway or anything?

27:03.979 --> 27:05.181
They just don't take physics.

27:06.243 --> 27:07.264
Oh, okay.

27:07.284 --> 27:11.931
I mean, can you imagine any of the football players signing up for physics?

27:12.704 --> 27:19.121
Well, Bean was in my class one time, and I was telling the joke.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.389
It's about potential energy.

27:22.469 --> 27:27.422
If you have water up here, you know, and then let it down while you can get energy out of it.

27:28.010 --> 27:30.433
And so I was trying to explain potential.

27:30.473 --> 27:32.336
I said, it's like the Aggie football team.

27:32.376 --> 27:33.678
I didn't know Bean was out there.

27:34.439 --> 27:37.923
I said, every September, they're going to win the conference.

27:38.684 --> 27:42.109
And a tremendous potential.

27:42.129 --> 27:44.252
Afterwards, somebody said Bean was in the class.

27:44.912 --> 27:46.595
He never came up or complained.

27:47.636 --> 27:52.322
Let me tell about cowboy physics.

27:52.342 --> 27:53.324
Oh, cowboy physics.

27:53.884 --> 27:55.907
Yeah, well, it's for people who were...

27:57.136 --> 27:57.837
What do they call it?

27:57.897 --> 28:01.343
Math, there's a word for it.

28:03.506 --> 28:07.372
Anyhow, they don't like mathematics, so you don't use any mathematics.

28:08.013 --> 28:11.219
And you can do a lot of physics without mathematics.

28:11.479 --> 28:13.863
And this is a freshman level physics?

28:13.883 --> 28:14.564
No, that's it.

28:14.985 --> 28:16.427
It's a 300 level.

28:17.268 --> 28:24.380
So the ones who really know physics are in 100 level, and the ones who don't know much physics get a 300 level credit.

28:24.721 --> 28:26.103
And this for non-majors?

28:26.143 --> 28:27.345
For non-majors, yeah.

28:27.465 --> 28:33.876
And usually the people who take it are majoring in education and or what else?

28:35.223 --> 28:36.865
I don't know.

28:36.885 --> 28:38.287
I haven't taught the course.

28:38.307 --> 28:43.032
I've been invited in to give a talk, and so I don't know where they come from.

28:43.773 --> 28:51.142
In general, most of the people that took the physics courses were majors in engineering and science.

28:52.544 --> 28:53.004
Pre-med.

28:53.445 --> 28:54.987
Pre-med.

28:55.007 --> 29:00.994
In fact, I remember asking one time, how many of you people are in this course because it's

29:01.379 --> 29:02.702
And it's not a requirement.

29:02.742 --> 29:03.985
I didn't get a single hand up.

29:04.747 --> 29:07.474
I mean, it's very professionally oriented.

29:08.095 --> 29:08.496
I don't know.

29:08.517 --> 29:15.253
It's too bad, because physics is very interesting, and particularly astronomy and black holes and the Big Bang and all that.

29:15.925 --> 29:19.829
you know, a good course can be made, and I think the cowboy physics was probably trying to do that.

29:20.490 --> 29:20.730
All right.

29:20.830 --> 29:31.961
In your normal routine, you had Monday, Wednesday, Friday courses, then you did your research on Tuesdays and Thursdays and in the afternoons?

29:31.981 --> 29:33.763
Yeah.

29:33.783 --> 29:34.023
Mm-hmm.

29:34.524 --> 29:36.486
How many graduate assistants normally did you have?

29:38.248 --> 29:39.249
You mean in the research?

29:41.331 --> 29:41.471
Mm-hmm.

29:41.491 --> 29:43.553
Well, when I got into nuclear medicine,

29:44.512 --> 29:48.718
I was kind of on my own because I didn't know what to do.

29:48.738 --> 29:52.884
I invented a new type of what they call a positron tomograph.

29:54.146 --> 29:59.533
And, but you can't have a graduate student helping you invent something.

29:59.553 --> 30:02.978
So I got $200,000 to build one.

30:03.379 --> 30:04.360
From what agency?

30:04.540 --> 30:06.423
From American Cancer Society.

30:07.845 --> 30:12.291
And, but then I needed people to screw things together and

30:13.013 --> 30:23.764
until you get the thing built and can make some tests, then you can't really give any work to a graduate student that's worth his time.

30:24.745 --> 30:28.068
Well, the first one we didn't work very well, so I had to build another one.

30:29.269 --> 30:39.780
And so it wasn't until I guess about 1985 or so that I finally got some systems that would work.

30:40.283 --> 30:48.977
And once you get some equipment that'll work, just like getting a cyclotron that's built, then you can bring in people to do research.

30:48.997 --> 30:57.950
How long did it take you, with that gadget, how long did it take from the dream to the reality?

31:00.555 --> 31:01.135
Well, let's see.

31:01.155 --> 31:04.080
The first paper I published was 1980.

31:05.140 --> 31:05.701
Well, let's see.

31:05.741 --> 31:09.287
You know, I had a small unit in 1976.

31:09.888 --> 31:17.821
I got out of the cyclotron about 1970, so the ideas ended up with a small unit in 1976.

31:18.823 --> 31:21.367
And what did this machine do?

31:22.749 --> 31:24.853
Well, it came out of the cyclotron.

31:26.876 --> 31:27.958
We had an experiment.
