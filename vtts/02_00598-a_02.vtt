00:02.410 --> 00:11.240
Okay, you were saying that the students in the 
square were receiving support from the other

00:02.410 --> 00:11.240
people in the city of Beijing. A

00:12.021 --> 00:18.108
sense of camaraderie, you're suggesting. And you 
were just telling me that the older generation had

00:18.209 --> 00:30.443
a feeling of admiration, maybe, and wishing they 
had been willing to speak up. That's what was

00:32.431 --> 00:34.714
beginning to dawn on them. And the students acted 
as the catalyst. The students were very

00:38.460 --> 00:55.224
politically wise in the sense that at the 
beginning, their comments were focused more at

00:38.460 --> 00:55.224
the government's treatment of the students in the 
university and wanting better conditions at the

00:38.460 --> 00:55.224
university. Like the poor cafeterias you were 
talking about. Poor cafeterias and living

00:57.267 --> 00:58.809
conditions and that. But they broadened their 
criticisms. to include corruption that was going

01:02.047 --> 01:06.291
on in the government. And we have to remember here 
that the students were not, and the people in

01:06.311 --> 01:12.698
Beijing, were not advocating to overthrow the 
government. This was a very peaceful

01:12.718 --> 01:16.622
demonstration. The students knew that they had to 
keep things peaceful because if there was any even

01:17.703 --> 01:30.636
hint of civil unrest, if they set any cars on fire or 
were throwing bricks through any windows, as

01:17.703 --> 01:30.636
we've seen happen in some other countries, that 
that would give the government the excuse they

01:31.072 --> 01:38.259
needed to use whatever level of force that they 
wanted to put down the demonstration. So the

01:38.299 --> 01:51.811
students did everything you would possibly to 
completely control what was going on so that

01:38.299 --> 01:51.811
nothing got out of hand, so that no fights broke 
out, so that there wasn't any real trouble. The

01:52.692 --> 01:59.138
students broadened their comments to include 
things that people from broader sectors of

01:59.658 --> 02:02.542
society could relate to. The corruption, as I 
mentioned, that there was going on in the

02:03.924 --> 02:15.499
government where people at high levels of 
government who were supposed to be looking out for

02:03.924 --> 02:15.499
the good of the people were not. They were using 
their position to their own advantage and to their

02:15.640 --> 02:22.529
family's advantage monetarily. And the people 
were also beginning to realize, I think, that they

02:28.143 --> 02:34.691
could actually make some decisions for 
themselves. Throughout Chinese history,

02:35.352 --> 02:51.212
through Confucianism, through their culture, 
that they had been trained to give their

02:35.352 --> 02:51.212
allegiance to the leader, the emperor and the 
people under him, all the way down to the family

02:35.352 --> 02:51.212
unit. The father was the absolute head of the 
family. You didn't question, you didn't disagree

02:56.797 --> 03:04.549
with what the person of authority above you told 
you. You just were totally submissive to that. You

03:08.095 --> 03:09.297
did whatever they said. And I think what has 
happened over the thousands of years that they

03:10.599 --> 03:24.340
have done is the people have subconsciously let 
themselves become dependent upon their leaders

03:10.599 --> 03:24.340
and they felt that they needed the leaders to make 
the decisions for them and to provide a place for

03:24.944 --> 03:34.101
them to live, to provide food, to provide clothing 
and that for them. And the older generation in

03:35.223 --> 03:47.425
particular, I think, during the 80s and the 
limited amount of economic freedom that they had,

03:35.223 --> 03:47.425
were beginning to realized that they did not need 
to rely on leaders to make all the decisions for

03:48.502 --> 03:54.268
them. They were beginning to get a feeling of 
self-confidence, that they could actually make

03:54.288 --> 04:03.419
some decisions for themselves. And they wanted 
the government, again, there's no opposition

04:03.719 --> 04:08.985
party. They were not asking to overthrow the 
government. They were asking the government to be

04:10.387 --> 04:17.074
more responsive to their needs and to allow them a 
little bit more control over their lives. For

04:20.037 --> 04:27.667
example, the government would decide when a 
person could get married, where they could have

04:20.037 --> 04:27.667
children, where they would live, where they would 
work. Things that we in this country take for

04:27.868 --> 04:35.458
granted as basic freedom of choice. People do not 
have that. When you were there in 85, 86 and had a

04:37.020 --> 04:42.488
chance to enter In your work with some of the 
students, you got a very clear feeling of this. You

04:48.149 --> 04:53.837
work where the government gives you a job after 
graduation and so forth. Carrying over that sense

04:55.720 --> 05:11.985
of understanding of the students, a little while 
ago you mentioned that you felt somehow a sense of

04:55.720 --> 05:11.985
the group as a whole wanting to keep things 
peaceful, not wanting to get things out of hand.

05:12.522 --> 05:19.793
Could you be specific at what gave you that feeling 
as you were watching from the sidelines or walking

05:12.522 --> 05:19.793
around? Well, in these groups, during the day, 
there were smaller crowds within Tiananmen

05:19.813 --> 05:40.403
Square in the evening, partly because people 
worked during the day, and I think partly because,

05:19.813 --> 05:40.403
again, the students and the Chinese people felt 
that if the government was going to do something,

05:19.813 --> 05:40.403
they were going to do it at night. And so in the early 
evening, a lot of people would start coming to

05:41.260 --> 05:46.365
Tiananmen Square. Now, there's not a whole lot of 
entertainment things to do in Beijing anyway. And

05:52.590 --> 05:58.275
Tiananmen Square, in the summertime, is a place 
where people can go. It's out in the open, so there

05:58.316 --> 06:00.618
is some breeze. So it's cooler than it is in the high 
rise apartments that they have. But because the

06:05.922 --> 06:09.145
demonstrations weren't going on, of course, 
there's a lot of curiosity. And people would come

06:09.225 --> 06:10.947
there in the evenings. And one evening, on a Friday 
evening, I had gone with some friends to eat at a

06:11.450 --> 06:19.761
restaurant near Tiananmen Square. And we tried 
coming down Chinatown Avenue in a car to see what

06:20.622 --> 06:27.931
was going on at Tiananmen Square. And three blocks 
before we even got to Tiananmen Square, Chinatown

06:28.032 --> 06:34.921
Avenue was completely filled with people. So we 
had to go. Not vehicles. You're talking about

06:39.446 --> 06:40.608
people. I'm talking about people. so we had to go 
around the Forbidden City behind that to get back

06:42.263 --> 06:51.094
towards our hotel. And yet, even though you had 
this large group of people, they were not unruly.

06:59.024 --> 07:00.306
Students were continually going around. You 
would see small groups, and they would be telling

07:00.366 --> 07:04.251
people what was happening, what was going on. As a 
matter of fact, throughout Beijing, you would see

07:04.271 --> 07:11.460
students with small groups of people around them, 
and the students were putting posters up on

07:12.014 --> 07:22.889
telephone poles and that for people to read so they 
could know what had been going on, what had been

07:12.014 --> 07:22.889
transpiring, or talking with these groups. And if 
you compare it to going to a college football game

07:23.910 --> 07:38.490
here in the United States, you get a certain amount 
of rowdiness and shoving and pushing, but there

07:23.910 --> 07:38.490
was none of that going on. Even though you had for 
larger numbers of people, it was still very

07:41.309 --> 07:46.355
peaceful. And the Saturday evening, I... Excuse 
me, that would be Saturday evening, the 3rd of

07:52.002 --> 07:54.906
June? Okay. This was the evening the massacre 
started. I had been out to the Great Wall that day.

08:02.215 --> 08:06.921
This was the last day of our conference, and they 
had arranged for buses to take us out there. And we

08:08.503 --> 08:09.544
had gotten back to Beijing about 5 o'clock in the 
afternoon and I had heard that the students had

08:09.946 --> 08:18.756
been tear gassed during the day. So I thought I 
would make my way to Tiananmen Square to see if the

08:19.677 --> 08:27.805
situation had changed from when I had been there 
the day before. Excuse me, you went out by

08:27.945 --> 08:29.467
yourself. So I went out by myself. I did not want to 
go directly to Tiananmen Square because with that

08:39.140 --> 09:08.843
large amount of people and we knew that there were 
troops soldiers in the train station which is

08:39.140 --> 09:08.843
about three blocks from channel square i did not 
want to get caught in the middle so it was i took this

08:39.140 --> 09:08.843
is where having lived in beijing for a year was was 
helpful to me in that i knew my way around the city

08:39.140 --> 09:08.843
and i felt that i would be able to sense any real 
danger or spot any real danger soon enough that I

09:09.447 --> 09:15.112
could find a way out of the situation. So I took a cab 
to the Friendship Store, which is about a mile and a

09:15.913 --> 09:25.642
half east of Tiananmen Square on the main avenue, 
Chandler Avenue. And when I got there, there were

09:27.003 --> 09:35.611
people going both directions towards the square 
and coming from the square. No one seemed to be

09:36.571 --> 09:38.273
unduly concerned or worried. In the early 
evenings, because a lot of people would

09:41.893 --> 09:54.132
congregate in Tiananmen Square, the bus and 
automobile traffic would be stopped. And it was

09:55.314 --> 09:59.180
already, there were hardly any cars or buses going 
down. So I decided what I'd do is I would walk

10:00.081 --> 10:04.007
towards Tiananmen Square And that way, if 
anything started happening, I would be able to see

10:04.308 --> 10:10.534
it and get out of the way. About halfway down, I saw a 
group of about 25 soldiers who were, I think, just

10:11.755 --> 10:21.825
out for some daily exercise. They were about 100 
yards ahead of me. And I watched them as they went

10:25.409 --> 10:28.552
down the street. And they crossed. I was on the 
north side of Cheltenham Avenue, which is on

10:34.143 --> 10:36.126
eight-lane roads. This is a major street. And they 
crossed that and went into one of the, down one of

10:39.049 --> 10:46.239
the side avenues there. And I did not see them. The 
people were walking by, didn't pay much attention

10:50.785 --> 10:54.390
to them. These were wearing soldiers carrying 
guns. Oh, yeah, they were in uniforms. These did

10:59.897 --> 11:01.058
not have guns. They were just out marching around. 
Okay. I said, I think they were just out for some

11:04.045 --> 11:10.692
daily exercise, and so they went back towards the 
direction of the train station. So it took me about

11:11.994 --> 11:19.002
an hour and a half to walk down to Tiananmen Square. 
I got there about 7 o'clock in the evening. And

11:21.484 --> 11:24.448
things looked peaceful. I could not really tell 
any difference in terms of the tents and the gas

11:24.548 --> 11:33.057
democracy flags and that that were flying. And I 
walked around the square and then decided to just

11:33.863 --> 11:42.752
observe what was going on. I got myself on the east 
side of Tiananmen Square because I felt that that

11:42.772 --> 11:58.127
had the most options for me in terms of avenues of 
escape to get out of there if anything started

11:42.772 --> 11:58.127
happening. And just sat there and watched the 
people. as more and more people started coming

12:02.517 --> 12:06.062
into the square. Most of the people, I said, in 
China, they get around on bicycles. And I was

12:11.731 --> 12:24.410
struck by the fact that here were people, there 
were young couples who were out on a date,

12:11.731 --> 12:24.410
teenagers, families, a father, a mother, a small 
child. They have these three-wheeled bicycles

12:24.991 --> 12:29.377
that have kind of a big seat in the back. And the 
father would be pedaling. The wife and the child

12:31.542 --> 12:33.084
would be in the back. And even some older couples 
were riding their bicycles around Tiananmen

12:34.145 --> 12:44.015
Square to see what was going on. Some of it was 
probably curiosity. And part of it was to support

12:46.617 --> 12:50.621
the students in what was going on. It reminded me of 
a Saturday night of people cruising around the

12:51.442 --> 13:00.351
Dairy Queen.

13:01.715 --> 13:05.320
All of these people and all this activity was very, 
very peaceful. And I was struck by the fact that

13:06.882 --> 13:16.255
there were four ambulances that were parked right 
over near me. And they had a big sign on the side of

13:17.036 --> 13:21.722
them that they had been provided by the government 
of Italy. And I thought across my head, why had the

13:22.604 --> 13:27.090
United States done something like this? Why had we 
provided some kind of care like this. And as a

13:33.432 --> 13:39.061
matter of fact, one of the students, while I was 
sitting there, apparently had passed out. And

13:39.381 --> 13:48.114
several of his friends had picked him up and put him 
on one of these Trishaw bicycles and brought him

13:39.381 --> 13:48.114
over to the ambulance, and the ambulance took him 
off towards the hospital. But the students were

13:48.856 --> 13:56.427
gathered mainly around the to the Heroes of the 
People, which is in the back part of the square in

13:57.284 --> 14:04.314
front of Miles Mausoleum. And they were using 
their own loudspeaker system that they had to talk

14:05.595 --> 14:12.705
to the large group. There are also the light poles 
around Tiananmen Square are speakers. And the

14:18.633 --> 14:23.460
government was using that to get its own message 
across. I wish now that I had taken the tape

14:23.845 --> 14:32.933
recorder along and taped some of that so I could 
have translated, but I didn't do that. After

14:32.954 --> 14:39.339
watching all this for about an hour, everything

14:32.954 --> 14:39.339
was so peaceful in a way it was boring. There 
wasn't, you know, I watched it and there wasn't

14:40.360 --> 14:44.484
anything dramatic happening. Can I ask, you're 
obviously different in size than most Orientals.

14:50.910 --> 14:52.772
You're over six foot. different in appearance, 
did that make you stand out, or did they respond to

14:53.410 --> 14:58.397
you? Well, people, they recognize that you're 
foreign. You can't hide that. Height is not so much

15:06.128 --> 15:10.374
a factor with the Chinese as it is with the 
Japanese. The Japanese are much more uniform with

15:10.634 --> 15:16.502
their height, about 5'2", 5'3". But the Chinese, 
there are a lot of Chinese that are 6 feet and

15:16.522 --> 15:22.270
taller, so My height was not particularly 
standing out. But, of course, the color of your

15:27.428 --> 15:32.256
skin and your eyes and that, you're obviously not 
Chinese. So they knew you were a foreigner. Oh,

15:34.118 --> 15:34.479
yes. But the people of Beijing, you see, they've 
been exposed to foreigners for eight or ten years,

15:35.040 --> 15:46.958
whereas some of the places that we went while we 
were in China, there was one village where...

15:48.608 --> 15:51.612
We may have been some of the first foreigners that 
they saw. And Taylor, our youngest, said two and a

15:51.652 --> 15:56.038
half with very blonde hair. He really attracted 
attention. That may have been the first foreign

15:58.422 --> 16:01.586
child that these people had ever seen. The people 
of Beijing, you don't stick out as much. I think

16:08.636 --> 16:15.405
what they were looking for in terms of foreigners, 
though, were particularly people who were the

16:08.636 --> 16:15.405
foreign press. And they realized that They needed 
to let the world know what was going on, because the

16:17.903 --> 16:26.833
Chinese government wasn't going to tell the 
people the truth. So they felt that they were very

16:26.853 --> 16:30.124
receptive to foreign press uh being there you 
mentioned though that you had a camera um that

16:30.678 --> 16:56.382
might have given you the aura of possibly being 
media if they didn't i took some pictures of that

16:30.678 --> 16:56.382
but but uh no one you know came up and tried to 
initiate any conversation with me at that point so

16:30.678 --> 16:56.382
you kind of sat for an hour an hour and a half 
watching what was going on what happened then and

16:30.678 --> 16:56.382
my uh daughter and older son were going to leave 
from the Houston airport the next morning. It

17:03.089 --> 17:09.416
would be Sunday morning, my time in Beijing, 
Saturday here in the States. And it would be Sunday

17:10.497 --> 17:19.066
evening in Beijing time, Sunday morning back here 
in the States. So I decided I'd go ahead back to my

17:19.746 --> 17:26.233
hotel and call back home one last time. because 
that would be Saturday morning here, and tell them

17:26.450 --> 17:34.720
everything is OK. Come on over, and I'll get you at 
the airport. So they have some little trishaw

17:34.740 --> 17:45.412
bicycles that people also use to earn some extra 
money as kind of taxicabs. So I was pretty tired

17:45.492 --> 17:51.579
from walking around the Great Wall all day, and 
then walking all the way down to Calvin Square. So I

17:51.659 --> 17:55.123
hired one of those guys. And as we were leaving 
Tiananmen Square, we turned east on Charlotte

17:56.200 --> 18:01.727
Avenue. I wanted to go back to the Friendship Store 
where I could catch a cab. I noticed that a group of

18:09.096 --> 18:18.909
students, just after we pulled into Charlotte 
Avenue, they picked up a flag, which had Chinese

18:09.096 --> 18:18.909
characters on it. I assumed it was representative 
of their university or wherever they were from.

18:26.339 --> 18:30.205
about a dozen of them started walking down 
Tiananmen Square behind us. So I took a couple

18:31.668 --> 18:40.823
pictures of that, and then some other groups were 
following them, walking down Tiananmen Square,

18:31.668 --> 18:40.823
and I thought, hey, this is kind of neat. And we'd 
gone about four blocks, and we came to the

18:42.005 --> 18:52.122
intersection where we knew to the south was the 
train station. We knew there were troops. Well, as

18:53.423 --> 18:59.288
we were coming up, there was a large mass of people 
that almost completely blocked Chonelet Avenue.

19:00.349 --> 19:08.876
And they have these little round boxes that sit out 
in the intersections. And policemen, in normal

19:08.937 --> 19:12.860
traffic, they stand up on those intersections. 
They direct traffic. Well, there wasn't any

19:14.121 --> 19:16.663
traffic. And the police had just kind of turned 
over the crowd control to the students. And so

19:22.752 --> 19:25.315
there were no policemen around. But there was a 
young man up on this platform. And he was trying to

19:29.801 --> 19:32.285
talk to the crowd. And I knew that the students had 
credentials and IDs to identify themselves as

19:33.246 --> 19:52.692
students so that people would know that they were 
really students and not somebody from the

19:33.246 --> 19:52.692
government trying to

19:33.246 --> 19:52.692
spread other types of information. And 
apparently some of the people in the crowd had

19:53.380 --> 19:59.568
asked him to identify himself, and he was holding 
up this ID and showing it to them. And I was

20:00.549 --> 20:07.558
concerned that maybe they were there because the 
troops were coming out of the railway station. But

20:09.140 --> 20:15.108
the guy was able to get around to the north side of 
the street. There was still part of one lane that

20:15.128 --> 20:16.991
was open there. And I was able to see down the street 
towards the train station. And there weren't any

20:22.490 --> 20:26.255
troops who were coming out from that direction. 
And we continued down on Chonklin Avenue. We were

20:31.962 --> 20:38.149
about 3 quarters of a mile to a mile away from 
Tiananmen Square. And Chonklin Avenue meets this

20:39.691 --> 20:45.979
other, what they call the Second Ring Road. It's 
like one of the loops around Houston. So this is a

20:49.703 --> 20:51.045
major intersection. And Charlotte Avenue goes up 
a slight incline there and a bridge over this

20:51.464 --> 20:58.874
second ring road. And as we approached that, there 
were more and more people coming there, and the

20:59.915 --> 21:06.945
street was completely blocked. And the taxi guy 
didn't speak much English, but made it clear

21:06.965 --> 21:16.478
there's no way he could get through that. And I was 
within a couple of blocks of the Friendship So I

21:19.460 --> 21:21.683
figured, you know, that was okay. He wanted to 
increase the price, but we bargained, and I was

21:22.544 --> 21:30.035
satisfied, and he was satisfied. And I got off the 
tri-shop, but this time the students with the

21:31.156 --> 21:34.461
flags. It just about caught on with me. And I walked 
up to the front edge of this crowd and was able to

21:36.464 --> 21:47.880
look over the heads of most people, and I realized 
that about 30 yards from me was an Army truck. and

21:48.637 --> 21:53.824
that the people had stopped this army truck, and 
the people were starting to climb into this army

21:48.637 --> 21:53.824
truck. As a matter of fact, there was a man who 
looked like he may have been one of the news people

21:54.645 --> 22:04.859
that had a video camera that was up in the back of 
this truck taking some pictures. And my immediate

22:06.261 --> 22:14.032
thought was, this is not the place that I want to be, 
that something could happen. So immediately,

22:14.993 --> 22:17.817
the... North was the direction where the fewest 
people would have figured, well, I'll just go down

22:18.758 --> 22:26.785
onto this ring road, and I'll go out that way, the 
new way around. And as I started to come down, I was

22:27.386 --> 22:32.631
able to see the whole Cloverleaf, realized it 
wasn't just one army truck. They had stopped the

22:32.651 --> 22:41.358
whole convoy of trucks that were from the top of the 
bridge all the way around the Cloverleaf down

22:32.651 --> 22:41.358
underneath. So there were probably 35 or 40 trucks 
full of troops. I also realized that everything

22:47.699 --> 22:51.262
was peaceful. There was no fighting. There was no 
arguing going on. And the students with the flags

22:54.686 --> 22:57.769
had gotten there by this time. And they got up on the 
lead truck. And they were talking to the crowd and

22:59.570 --> 23:03.914
keeping everybody very peaceful. So I had my 
camera. And I said, well, go ahead and take a

23:07.758 --> 23:09.740
chance. I'm taking a couple of pictures, even 
though I knew you weren't supposed to take

23:09.800 --> 23:16.086
pictures of the military. you know, this was a 
chance of a lifetime. So I took several pictures of

23:18.044 --> 23:25.255
the trucks that were stopped on top of this bridge. 
I deliberately had left my flash at home because I

23:26.096 --> 23:42.200
figured if it did get dark and I left my flash back at 
the hotel because I did not want to be tempted to

23:26.096 --> 23:42.200
take pictures in the dark because that way you're 
spotted immediately. And I figured there was

23:43.242 --> 23:44.183
enough commotion of the people who were watching 
this guy with the video camera that nobody would

23:44.416 --> 23:52.405
pay attention to me taking some pictures. So I took 
several pictures, but then decided that I better

23:52.425 --> 24:02.295
work my way over to the other side of this overpass.

24:02.716 --> 24:08.041
Number one, that would get me closer to the 
friendship store where I figured that I could get a

24:02.716 --> 24:08.041
taxi. And that way, I figured I wouldn't be trapped 
between these troops and the people in Tiananmen

24:13.998 --> 24:15.280
Square. And as I, they have a little footbridge 
there that people can go across, and I stopped

24:15.340 --> 24:33.266
there for a little while, and this Chinese man in 
his early 20s started talking to me. He just knew a

24:33.406 --> 24:43.380
few words of English, and my Chinese was not good 
enough to get across the ideas to begin

24:33.406 --> 24:43.380
communicating with him. And there was this 
younger girl, probably 15, 16, high school

24:44.288 --> 24:49.015
student. And her mother was standing nearby. And 
her mother encouraged

24:52.480 --> 25:00.431
the girl to act as a translator, because she had 
taken some English in high school. And so she would

25:01.412 --> 25:06.640
interpret the guy's question to me, and then my 
answer to him. And they asked me where I was from and

25:07.421 --> 25:11.967
where I was staying. I was somewhat concerned 
about giving too much detail because you don't

25:12.267 --> 25:19.556
know who these people are. And we knew that the 
government had some of their secret police in some

25:20.358 --> 25:29.589
of these crowds trying to identify people with 
that. So I was a little bit leery of giving them too

25:30.611 --> 25:41.565
much information about my name and where I was 
staying and that, just to talk to generalities.

25:42.153 --> 25:56.946
After four or five minutes of that, then I went 
ahead and went across and go to the outside of the

25:42.153 --> 25:56.946
crowd on the east side and

25:42.153 --> 25:56.946
sat down and

25:42.153 --> 25:56.946
watched what was going on. By this time, I'd been 
there for about, oh, maybe 15, 20 minutes. And it

26:01.631 --> 26:11.940
was very much like a block party in that by this 
time, vendors who were selling soda pop, ice

26:01.631 --> 26:11.940
cream, They also cooked these little sticks, and 
they put pieces of pork on it. They have a little

26:17.227 --> 26:22.372
hibachi-like thing that they carry on with them, 
and they were selling those. If I didn't know the

26:24.034 --> 26:32.203
seriousness of the situation with these troops 
sitting there, I would have thought this was a

26:24.034 --> 26:32.203
party going on. This was all done in sight of that 
convoy. Yeah, I was sitting maybe 20 yards from the

26:35.346 --> 26:39.130
convoy. As a matter of fact, a couple of times, I 
walked up to the trucks. I walked up close enough I

26:44.344 --> 26:49.011
could shake hands with the soldiers who were in the 
trucks. And I was taking a few pictures. But I

26:51.295 --> 26:57.124
didn't want to call too much attention to myself, 
so I didn't try to communicate with these

26:51.295 --> 26:57.124
soldiers. But the people that were there, they 
were very calm. There was no arguing between the

27:02.211 --> 27:05.616
soldiers and the people. There was no arguing 
among the people. There was no pushing and

27:06.999 --> 27:09.282
shoving. parents were taking their children, 
three years old, five years old, and they were

27:10.038 --> 27:17.747
setting them up on the hoods of these trucks that 
the troops were in. I did not see any weapons in

27:18.488 --> 27:23.093
these troops' hands. They may have had them down on 
the bottom of the floorboards of the truck. I may

27:27.399 --> 27:39.673
have been fortunate enough that I ran into a unit 
from the division that's stationed there in

27:27.399 --> 27:39.673
Beijing who knew what was going on, knew that there 
was not any civil disobedience going on in

27:39.974 --> 27:50.969
Tiananmen Square, were sympathetic towards the 
students, and did not want to go in there and shoot

27:39.974 --> 27:50.969
the students. The Western media, from what I 
understand, came to determine that there were two

27:51.069 --> 28:06.150
armies, the 27th Army, which was not liked in 
Beijing and was from outside, and there was the

27:51.069 --> 28:06.150
38th Army, which was Beijing-based. you're 
saying you're not sure which this was, but had a

28:06.586 --> 28:12.075
feeling it was friendly. With the Chinese, part of 
their, supposedly everybody is of equal status,

28:12.315 --> 28:28.942
even the military, they don't have insignia 
identifying what unit they're with or what their

28:12.315 --> 28:28.942
rank is. They do not. They do not. Now, because we 
were there, We had picked up on a few of the

28:34.109 --> 28:35.931
subtleties. For example, the officers on their 
green shirts, they have pockets. Enlisted men do

28:42.139 --> 28:43.101
not. But unless you're aware of some things like 
that, you can't tell even who the officers are

28:43.862 --> 28:57.419
versus the enlisted men, much less what unit these 
people are attached to. The...

29:04.045 --> 29:12.695
The main reason why I think that these were part of 
the friendly troops was because they were not

29:04.045 --> 29:12.695
acting in any violent way. They were not trying to 
force their way through the crowd. I remember

29:17.800 --> 29:25.909
sitting, they have a little railing that goes 
around on the edge of the road there. I was sitting

29:25.929 --> 29:33.057
on one of these and there was one little Chinese 
Boeing, must have been about two and a half, three

29:25.929 --> 29:33.057
years old, And he could tell that I was different by 
the way I looked. And he was very curious. And his

29:40.316 --> 29:43.659
mother tried to encourage him to come closer. And I 
would smile at him and wave to him. And he would take

29:45.961 --> 29:48.022
a step or two closer to me. And then he would go back 
to his mother and grab his mother's leg.

29:56.310 --> 30:02.655
But this is what, I guess, amazed me, is to how these 
people could be so peaceful. in such a potentially

30:03.479 --> 30:08.606
explosive situation. Okay, you know what 
happened later on. I mean, you're, this is almost

30:13.392 --> 30:23.885
nine months later, so you know there was a violent 
massacre is the term that's been used.

30:26.689 --> 30:32.997
What happened now from this point when you were 
watching these events and in her talking with the,

30:33.922 --> 30:38.366
waving and so forth with these people. What 
happened from this point till you knew something

30:38.807 --> 30:44.572
traumatic had happened on the school? Well, I 
stayed with this group of people for about an hour,

30:44.592 --> 30:51.739
from about 8.30 to 9.30. And one of the

30:51.759 --> 31:03.490
feelings that I had while I was there was, you know, 
gee, I wish that Kristen and Lance were already

30:51.759 --> 31:03.490
there, and I wish that Gay and Taylor could come
