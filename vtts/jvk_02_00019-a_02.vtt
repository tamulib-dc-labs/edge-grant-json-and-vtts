WEBVTT

00:00:02.039 --> 00:00:04.282
Were those all faculty couples?

00:00:05.624 --> 00:00:09.210
Not entirely, but most of them were, yeah.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.475
And what was your impression of the climate in Texas?

00:00:14.678 --> 00:00:17.462
Well, it's the same as it is today.

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:19.485
It's variable.

00:00:21.408 --> 00:00:31.303
It was the second year we were here, we had 72 inches of rain, and I've seen

00:00:31.553 --> 00:00:40.548
six inches of snow and I've seen 115 degrees.

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:45.537
What was your impression of the president of Texas A&M at the time you arrived?

00:00:48.262 --> 00:00:48.883
I loved him.

00:00:50.486 --> 00:00:52.789
I thought he was a great person.

00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:56.616
And we used to have

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:07.201
faculty meetings in the spring in Guyon Hall, which is another non-existent building.

00:01:08.263 --> 00:01:17.203
I remember when somebody got up and was grousing about something and he told them Highway 6 runs both ways.

00:01:18.922 --> 00:01:25.152
I thought whoever it was, and I have a suspicion who it was.

00:01:25.172 --> 00:01:25.412
Right.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:33.646
Now you got here at about the time some of those great changes were about to happen at A&M.

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:34.627
Yeah.

00:01:34.647 --> 00:01:39.495
What was the faculty's attitude as far as you knew about those changes at A&M?

00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:43.478
Well, it depended on who they were.

00:01:43.498 --> 00:01:54.312
A lot of the A&M had a lot of Aggies on the faculty, and a number of them were very much against the change.

00:01:55.133 --> 00:02:03.104
Most of the people who were from other places were in favor of the change.

00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:08.431
If we had had a vote in the Department of Oceanography, what would the vote have been, probably?

00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:09.853
Oh, it would have been...

00:02:11.757 --> 00:02:12.999
Almost entirely?

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:14.521
I mean, almost unanimously?

00:02:15.462 --> 00:02:18.646
I would guess, close to.

00:02:19.748 --> 00:02:29.742
Well, you said integration, but also co-education and non-compulsory cohort.

00:02:30.262 --> 00:02:35.149
During those early, those first years here, where did you all do your shopping?

00:02:39.922 --> 00:02:42.285
At Safeway, I think.

00:02:42.806 --> 00:02:43.247
Okay.

00:02:43.347 --> 00:02:47.893
Downtown, down at the mall?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.086
Redmond Terrace was a big shopping area.

00:02:58.688 --> 00:03:09.102
If you wanted hardware, you went to Central Texas Hardware in downtown Bryan, which is then and probably would still be the best hardware store in the country.

00:03:10.448 --> 00:03:16.134
I remember I bought my wife a chainsaw for her birthday.

00:03:20.598 --> 00:03:25.923
People in the hardware store never forgot that.

00:03:25.943 --> 00:03:27.685
All right.

00:03:27.745 --> 00:03:40.017
Back in your own career, how many years were you here before you joined the administration?

00:03:40.452 --> 00:03:49.783
The second year I was here, George Cruz had asked me to come over to graduate college as part-time assistant dean.

00:03:49.803 --> 00:03:57.052
And how in the world he got my name or got me lined up, I'll never know.

00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:01.558
His daughter and my daughter were friends.

00:04:01.858 --> 00:04:02.919
Okay.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.104
But that was no reason for him to pick me as the assistant dean.

00:04:07.124 --> 00:04:09.227
Was there an interview?

00:04:10.726 --> 00:04:12.989
Yeah, he interviewed me.

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.770
Do you remember what?

00:04:15.152 --> 00:04:16.694
He just sat and talked.

00:04:18.757 --> 00:04:29.072
Nothing very specific, except he and I had the same views on how things ought to work, and they weren't working that way at the time.

00:04:29.733 --> 00:04:33.137
How did there come to be a vacancy that he needed to fill?

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.223
You were quitting, I think.

00:04:39.042 --> 00:04:45.012
Yeah, I was going back to the history department because I had decided I didn't want to be a full-time administrator.

00:04:45.633 --> 00:04:48.217
So you became a real full-time administrator.

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:49.659
Later.

00:04:49.679 --> 00:05:01.559
Well, anyway, the interesting thing was Dr. Wayne Hall was academic vice president and dean of the graduate college, both.

00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:05.826
And then Kunze came in as dean.

00:05:10.666 --> 00:05:16.093
Dr. Hall's executive secretary continued to run everything.

00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:34.918
And then Dr. Hall went to Bennington, New York, his president up there, and Horace Byers, who had been our dean in geosciences, came over as academic vice president.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:06:05.749
and the girls in the office wanted to wear slacks and mrs watson would never let him wear slack now that's doris watson describe her and personality and all i describe her best as a 20-year bosun she

00:06:06.303 --> 00:06:10.807
ran everything with an iron fist, and she had the power.

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:15.731
Anything she said, Dr. Hall would agree with it.

00:06:16.352 --> 00:06:18.153
And she was very well organized.

00:06:19.034 --> 00:06:21.356
Yeah.

00:06:21.376 --> 00:06:24.859
She kept track of everything, and she did everything.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:35.989
But the interesting part was Dean Kunze went to Dr. Byers and said,

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:50.713
Some of the girls in the office would like to wear slacks because when they get up on stools to get files or bend over to get files, they feel more comfortable in slacks.

00:06:51.654 --> 00:06:52.996
Dr. Meyers said, fine.

00:06:53.916 --> 00:07:01.704
And so one day, a couple of the girls came in slacks, and Mrs. Watson came in glued, of course.

00:07:03.325 --> 00:07:06.128
And they said, well, do you consider

00:07:16.925 --> 00:07:18.907
The girls, they could wear slacks.

00:07:19.067 --> 00:07:25.614
And Dr. Byers looked her in the eye and said, well, after all, he's the dean.

00:07:25.634 --> 00:07:28.657
And I think she retired two weeks later.

00:07:29.418 --> 00:07:31.800
She'd lost her power base.

00:07:33.382 --> 00:07:38.767
And the same thing happened in First Presbyterian Church.

00:07:39.908 --> 00:07:44.333
Describe Byers and Kunze and the way they went about their task.

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:52.542
Well, Byers just let Coonsey go as near as I could tell.

00:07:52.622 --> 00:07:56.107
George would go and check with him on things once in a while.

00:07:57.108 --> 00:08:13.712
But the Graduate College had been sort of run out of the hip pocket for so long that Coonsey decided that we needed to get things established.

00:08:14.333 --> 00:08:19.800
with the help of the Graduate Council and others.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:30.993
He began to rewrite the catalog, put things down so that there would never be a question of whether it was A or B.

00:08:31.313 --> 00:08:32.755
It was either A or B.

00:08:33.316 --> 00:08:35.278
Now, y'all were located physically where?

00:08:36.079 --> 00:08:41.185
We were in the Koch Building to start with.

00:08:41.806 --> 00:08:45.231
And what else was in the Koch building at that time?

00:08:47.054 --> 00:08:50.018
The first floor was all fiscal offices.

00:08:50.278 --> 00:08:55.166
No, it was fiscal office and registrar.

00:08:56.187 --> 00:09:00.433
And the second floor was the academic vice president and the graduate college.

00:09:02.296 --> 00:09:05.721
And I think Clark Diebel's office was up there, too.

00:09:06.005 --> 00:09:11.791
And the President was over in the System Building, as we called it then?

00:09:11.852 --> 00:09:14.254
No, the President was up there too.

00:09:14.414 --> 00:09:15.015
Was he up there?

00:09:15.035 --> 00:09:20.601
No, no, he was in the Systems Building, yeah.

00:09:20.621 --> 00:09:20.701
Mr.

00:09:20.762 --> 00:09:25.146
Rudder was in the Systems Building.

00:09:25.166 --> 00:09:34.577
It's interesting, to give you an idea of what kind of a guy he was, he was in California visiting his brother who had cancer.

00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:40.746
And Joe's father and uncle were taking care of Mr. Rutter's brother.

00:09:42.328 --> 00:09:48.453
And Joe's dad- Joe- Your wife.

00:09:48.634 --> 00:09:51.556
Oh, oh, oh.

00:09:51.596 --> 00:09:52.998
Your wife.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.844
Joe's dad tried to get him to check into the hospital out there.

00:10:00.405 --> 00:10:01.746
He said he's a sick man.

00:10:02.857 --> 00:10:04.719
But he wouldn't do it.

00:10:04.739 --> 00:10:10.405
He had to get back to A&M to take care of things.

00:10:11.046 --> 00:10:20.657
But as soon as he got back, he called my wife to tell her what nice people her uncle and father were.

00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:30.507
And I think he had his circuitry collapse about two weeks later after he got back.

00:10:30.527 --> 00:10:30.888
Really?

00:10:31.428 --> 00:10:32.830
It was a very short time.

00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:39.423
So Joe's dad was right.

00:10:39.483 --> 00:10:50.580
As far as you remember, what was Rutter's administrative style regarding academic matters?

00:10:56.189 --> 00:10:58.513
Where did academic decisions originate?

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.645
I can't honestly answer that, Haskell.

00:11:04.665 --> 00:11:07.569
Do you remember him ever meddling?

00:11:10.973 --> 00:11:11.294
No.

00:11:11.434 --> 00:11:12.856
Not with our department.

00:11:13.477 --> 00:11:17.242
Well, and wasn't the academic vice president in charge of academics?

00:11:17.983 --> 00:11:19.285
That's the answer I'm assuming.

00:11:21.548 --> 00:11:25.093
I assume Wayne Hall was, but I'm not sure.

00:11:25.954 --> 00:11:28.197
I never got into that.

00:11:31.315 --> 00:11:34.141
All right, then let's do Coonsey.

00:11:35.264 --> 00:11:38.050
What were the duties of the graduate college then?

00:11:40.295 --> 00:11:44.565
Well, they were in charge of admissions.

00:11:45.305 --> 00:11:50.191
of graduate students, degree programs.

00:11:50.951 --> 00:12:01.503
Did the central graduate dean and his staff, did they actually decide who was admitted, or did the departments?

00:12:04.146 --> 00:12:06.409
It was sort of a mixture.

00:12:06.969 --> 00:12:14.518
The departments recommended, but the graduate office made the decision.

00:12:15.545 --> 00:12:18.574
Do you remember any instances where there was a disagreement?

00:12:18.795 --> 00:12:21.884
I remember a lot of instances where there were disagreements.

00:12:22.065 --> 00:12:25.234
What were the usual causes of the disagreement?

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.727
primarily one department.

00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:36.120
And they wanted to admit foreign students who didn't know any English.

00:12:36.621 --> 00:12:38.204
They didn't care whether they knew English.

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:43.495
They could stand over against the lab bench and let them do research.

00:12:43.515 --> 00:12:44.076
Who was that?

00:12:44.337 --> 00:12:45.940
Chemistry.

00:12:47.135 --> 00:13:03.860
At the time you first joined the graduate administration, which programs here at A&M, to which programs would you give the highest marks for their quality of their graduate programs?

00:13:04.581 --> 00:13:08.127
Well, chemistry again would be one of the high ones.

00:13:08.147 --> 00:13:08.247
Okay.

00:13:09.368 --> 00:13:09.829
Who else?

00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:16.399
Hard to live with, but physics was pretty good.

00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:23.603
Tell me about history.

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:25.305
Not then.

00:13:25.325 --> 00:13:28.569
It used to seem to be a reasonably good local program.

00:13:28.589 --> 00:13:30.911
Yeah, but it wasn't a national program then.

00:13:31.052 --> 00:13:31.472
Oh, no.

00:13:33.254 --> 00:13:35.417
There weren't very many national programs here.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:47.331
The vet school was well thought of nationally, but they had the palm rings so inbred that

00:13:48.391 --> 00:13:53.779
They got into all kinds of problems due to that, I think.

00:13:53.799 --> 00:14:03.133
As far as you know, how did chemistry and economics get identified as two graduate programs to get special attention?

00:14:03.734 --> 00:14:06.358
Economics, that's another one I hadn't thought of.

00:14:11.085 --> 00:14:12.527
Who persuaded Rutter to?

00:14:12.547 --> 00:14:15.511
I have no idea.

00:14:16.252 --> 00:14:18.195
I don't either.

00:14:20.048 --> 00:14:22.802
As a matter of fact, I'm not sure Rutter is the one

00:14:24.875 --> 00:14:37.710
The reason I know that it was a little bit before him is that, who was the longtime department head?

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.292
Martel?

00:14:39.312 --> 00:14:40.733
No, in economics.

00:14:41.554 --> 00:14:44.218
Oh, economics.

00:14:44.238 --> 00:14:46.040
Comparatively short, very conservative.

00:14:47.141 --> 00:14:48.242
He came from Florida State.

00:14:48.803 --> 00:14:50.225
He's retired up in Dallas now.

00:14:51.446 --> 00:14:53.228
The only two people I know

00:14:53.883 --> 00:15:10.221
doing economics with phil graham and tom saving right it's it was the department head that hired them rutter gave a long lecture to him about not getting any liberals and he didn't need to preach that to that department head mill greenhut

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.733
Oh, Mel Greenhut, yeah.

00:15:13.895 --> 00:15:16.979
Because Mel Greenhut was very much a conservative.

00:15:17.681 --> 00:15:21.286
I didn't realize Mel was a department head.

00:15:21.767 --> 00:15:23.509
Do you know who brought, did Mr.

00:15:23.549 --> 00:15:26.434
Rudder, who brought Martell?

00:15:27.375 --> 00:15:28.196
Who found him?

00:15:28.216 --> 00:15:30.500
I have no idea.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.743
I would suspect it was probably.

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:35.247
Byers maybe?

00:15:38.433 --> 00:15:51.970
Now when you went to work in the graduate college office, was Wayne Hall still there?

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:52.771
Yes.

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:58.298
Describe his personality and his style of doing things.

00:16:02.007 --> 00:16:05.331
Near as I could tell, he let Mrs. Watson do most of it.

00:16:06.913 --> 00:16:25.253
But he was sort of a soft-spoken person who really didn't do a lot of administration, pushing things, as near as I could tell.

00:16:25.994 --> 00:16:31.440
I may be wrong, but I wasn't around him very long.

00:16:31.927 --> 00:16:52.688
I've learned in some of the material I've gathered that he deserves very, very high praise in persuading Rutter that those changes, which Rutter would later come to campaign for, Rutter at first was worried that he couldn't make them work.

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:55.130
You mean women?

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:59.875
Women and non-compulsory corps and integration and higher admission requirements.

00:17:00.378 --> 00:17:02.340
Hall persuaded him that we had to do it.

00:17:03.302 --> 00:17:04.483
It's interesting.

00:17:04.804 --> 00:17:23.988
A&M had a full-time corps requirement, but the guy who was in charge of the aquarium at Scripps Institution went to A&M and was not in the corps.

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:29.575
He wore a uniform and he had a shoulder patch that said non-reg.

00:17:32.153 --> 00:17:51.284
And he was a folk singer and he wrote a bestseller about the atomic bomb and McCarthy put him on his blacklist.

00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:53.468
Oh, as being a communist sympathizer.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.473
But he was an A&M graduate.

00:17:57.348 --> 00:17:59.811
I'm not sure he graduated, but he did attend.

00:17:59.971 --> 00:18:00.672
Oh, okay.

00:18:00.692 --> 00:18:01.253
My, my.

00:18:02.134 --> 00:18:04.397
His name was Sam Hinton.

00:18:04.738 --> 00:18:05.379
Hinton?

00:18:05.399 --> 00:18:05.839
Hinton.

00:18:05.859 --> 00:18:06.300
Hinton.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.081
Sam Hinton.

00:18:07.101 --> 00:18:10.285
H-I-N-T-O-N. Sam Hinton.

00:18:10.305 --> 00:18:12.848
Describe Dean George Coonsey.

00:18:12.869 --> 00:18:14.491
Make believe that I never knew him.

00:18:14.571 --> 00:18:17.254
Tell me all you know about him.

00:18:18.276 --> 00:18:26.106
George is a very conservative person who

00:18:26.812 --> 00:18:33.466
wants everything in writing, so to speak.

00:18:34.749 --> 00:18:41.243
When he first became graduate dean, he put out graduate college memoranda

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:51.699
detailing changes in the catalog requirements and clarifying catalog requirements.

00:18:51.719 --> 00:18:59.767
He put out so many they became known as Kunze games.

00:18:59.787 --> 00:19:11.719
A fellow in aeronautical engineering was wandering across campus one night and he fell into a ditch that

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.763
construction people that dug.

00:19:16.545 --> 00:19:29.460
And the only way he found his way out was to make a torch out of a graduate college memoranda and hook it up and find his way out at Bob Wick.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.020
Bob Wick?

00:19:31.202 --> 00:19:34.305
Actually he broke his back when he fell in there.

00:19:34.325 --> 00:19:34.545
Oh my.

00:19:34.565 --> 00:19:38.670
And it's amazing that he was able to get out.

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:42.094
Describe George Coonsey by personality.

00:19:45.888 --> 00:20:06.040
I'd say George was an outgoing person really, easy to get to know and very friendly, unless you were pushing him the wrong way and then he could dig his heels in and be as contrary as anything.

00:20:07.572 --> 00:20:13.386
I think he did a very good job of selling the graduate college to the university.

00:20:13.406 --> 00:20:24.332
What do you think, when he, in his early years as dean, what do you think his goals were for A&M's graduate programs?

00:20:25.477 --> 00:20:30.724
wanted to have a superior graduate program period.

00:20:30.744 --> 00:20:37.693
I don't think he had any other than the graduate program per se.

00:20:37.713 --> 00:20:41.277
I don't think he had anything he pushed.

00:20:41.297 --> 00:20:46.784
Did he have any favorites and any blind spots?

00:20:48.587 --> 00:20:49.628
I don't think so.

00:20:53.118 --> 00:20:57.203
And Safer George, he did everything in an even-handed way.

00:20:58.404 --> 00:21:04.010
Soil crop science, where he came from, got treated just like everybody else.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:08.335
And I think that was one of the real strengths of the graduate colleges.

00:21:08.615 --> 00:21:15.122
We really made an attempt not to play favorites.

00:21:15.142 --> 00:21:20.188
Now, you all were, I mean, you all managed the graduate admissions.

00:21:20.894 --> 00:21:28.262
How did you all watch over graduate college standards, quality?

00:21:29.604 --> 00:21:34.229
Well, Coonsey, we had an awful time doing it.

00:21:34.529 --> 00:21:38.894
We used to post grades by hand on all the degree programs.

00:21:38.974 --> 00:21:49.045
And as the graduate program began to grow, it was just physically impossible to do that without a tremendous staff.

00:21:50.307 --> 00:21:52.830
which some colleges decided to do.

00:21:53.952 --> 00:21:59.779
But Kunze decided the way to go was with computers very early in the game.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:16.099
And he developed a graduate college program, which actually became the standard for most of the graduate colleges in the United States.

00:22:16.119 --> 00:22:18.542
And with that, he could

00:22:20.716 --> 00:22:30.715
get the grades on there and get a complete printout for each student at the end of every semester.

00:22:31.596 --> 00:22:43.078
We operated the graduate college with a staff that was about, I'd say about a fifth of what the University of Texas was doing.

00:22:43.615 --> 00:22:56.671
And when you began there were doctoral programs in agriculture, engineering, geoscience, veterinary medicine, but that's about it, wasn't it?

00:22:56.691 --> 00:23:01.016
That was about it.

00:23:01.196 --> 00:23:07.564
And we worked with the departments and the colleges

00:23:08.236 --> 00:23:11.682
and the coordinating board getting graduate degrees.

00:23:13.906 --> 00:23:28.751
When you were beginning in your early years, did you all still review thesis and dissertation proposals and appoint the graduate council representatives to doctoral committees?

00:23:30.975 --> 00:23:31.075
Yeah.

00:23:31.095 --> 00:23:32.117
We did that.

00:23:40.518 --> 00:23:46.187
But we didn't review the dissertations.

00:23:47.749 --> 00:23:49.211
That was the committee's problem.

00:23:50.333 --> 00:23:54.239
But we approved the committees and the proposals.

00:23:54.259 --> 00:24:03.032
And then we also had a thesis and dissertation clerk who checked for style.

00:24:03.502 --> 00:24:06.946
style and format, nothing more.

00:24:06.966 --> 00:24:16.356
When you were beginning those duties, did Dean Coonsey give you any guidelines, advice, things to do or not to do?

00:24:18.258 --> 00:24:18.899
In appointing?

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:23.744
No, no, no, in your duties as to what he expected of you.

00:24:25.025 --> 00:24:28.429
Did he tell you some things he wanted you to do or not to do?

00:24:31.936 --> 00:24:33.438
No.

00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:39.706
You just said you wanted good science.

00:24:39.906 --> 00:24:47.015
What was your typical day's routine as the associate dean of the graduate school?

00:24:47.475 --> 00:24:48.196
Can we stop?

00:24:48.216 --> 00:24:48.477
Sure.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:58.369
When you were beginning as the associate dean of the graduate school, what was your typical routine?

00:24:58.569 --> 00:24:59.891
What time did you get there?

00:25:00.011 --> 00:25:01.453
What was a typical day's?

00:25:02.159 --> 00:25:04.362
activities and so forth?

00:25:04.382 --> 00:25:11.410
I'd usually try to get there at 7 in the morning if at all possible and no later than 730.

00:25:12.051 --> 00:25:13.953
And you parked?

00:25:13.973 --> 00:25:17.737
I parked right outside the door, really.

00:25:17.758 --> 00:25:20.341
In that little lot just south of the Koch building?

00:25:20.361 --> 00:25:20.541
Yeah.

00:25:22.623 --> 00:25:24.085
What kind of car were you driving then?

00:25:25.246 --> 00:25:29.972
I had an ancient BMW.

00:25:30.458 --> 00:25:32.601
I parked right next to Robert Smith.

00:25:36.125 --> 00:25:45.136
But I would try to get there that early because I could accomplish about a day's work in that hour.

00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:51.364
Then during the day I spent most of the time on the phone.

00:25:51.384 --> 00:25:54.728
I'd come home to lunch or go out with somebody.

00:25:55.653 --> 00:25:58.677
And I'd go back and spend the rest of the time on the phone.

00:25:58.697 --> 00:26:02.602
By the clock, usually it began to quiet down a little bit.

00:26:02.882 --> 00:26:09.730
And I would work till 6 and get that other hour when I was in the phone business.

00:26:10.651 --> 00:26:13.635
And that was pretty much the routine.

00:26:14.456 --> 00:26:16.779
Now, we were still having Saturday classes.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.382
Did you go to the office on Saturday mornings?

00:26:19.823 --> 00:26:21.745
No.

00:26:24.138 --> 00:26:38.372
I would go to the office on Saturday or even Sunday if there was some reason to, if somebody wanted something or if I was behind in my work.

00:26:39.173 --> 00:26:46.741
Do you remember any emergency matters that you had to take care of in some unusual hour, night or day?

00:26:46.781 --> 00:26:54.128
I got called one night to

00:26:57.517 --> 00:27:04.188
I was still part-time oceanography and I think I was a police officer.

00:27:04.228 --> 00:27:15.766
Somebody called me and said there was a truckload of TNT at Goodwin Hall and they wondered where to put it.

00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:22.917
So I told them to call the department head.

00:27:23.926 --> 00:27:28.312
I think he told them where to put it, as a matter of fact.

00:27:28.332 --> 00:27:35.503
But I think it was supposed to go out to the annex where there was an ammunition revetment.

00:27:35.523 --> 00:27:42.873
In those days, we used TNT to do sonic work.

00:27:43.053 --> 00:27:49.022
Now, describe your duties as compared to those of Dean George Coonsey.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:28:08.767
Well, I worked with degree programs and dissertation and thesis proposals in the colleges of science, geoscience, veterinary medicine.

00:28:13.812 --> 00:28:15.594
George didn't do much of that.

00:28:15.655 --> 00:28:23.143
He did policy things.

00:28:23.528 --> 00:28:36.282
I honestly don't know a lot of what George did, but he didn't have time to do degree programs and that sort of thing.

00:28:36.302 --> 00:28:41.067
Did you bring much work home in your briefcase at night?

00:28:41.347 --> 00:28:43.750
I'd sneak some home once in a while, yeah.

00:28:44.631 --> 00:28:49.456
But generally your seven till six long day?

00:28:49.496 --> 00:28:51.038
Yeah.

00:28:51.406 --> 00:28:54.430
I once in a while I'd bring stuff home.

00:28:56.432 --> 00:29:04.221
George discouraged us from doing that because the files on the student are pretty confidential.

00:29:05.923 --> 00:29:08.927
And that was another thing with the computer.

00:29:08.947 --> 00:29:17.177
We worried about people getting into the files and seeing.

00:29:20.245 --> 00:29:28.195
I remember somebody got fired for getting into the files, but I can't remember any of the particulars.

00:29:29.096 --> 00:29:35.304
All right, now you started in 1960, what year, at the graduate school?

00:29:37.927 --> 00:29:42.653
Let's see, I came here in 65, probably 67.

00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:44.956
Okay.

00:29:45.677 --> 00:29:49.442
Do you remember when you heard that Mr. Rutter was ill?

00:29:49.945 --> 00:29:53.229
Do you remember anything about his illness and death?

00:29:54.351 --> 00:29:58.656
The only thing I remember is his death.

00:29:58.676 --> 00:30:00.258
And what was the campus reaction?

00:30:06.125 --> 00:30:11.352
It was pretty much like the day Kennedy got shot, is my feeling.

00:30:11.372 --> 00:30:15.497
Were you or others aware that he was ill?

00:30:16.321 --> 00:30:16.922
I wasn't.

00:30:17.703 --> 00:30:19.225
I'm sure others were.

00:30:19.245 --> 00:30:20.748
I don't think many people were, though.

00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:30.963
And then Ludeke became the interim president.

00:30:30.983 --> 00:30:35.069
Did that change the graduate college's work at all?

00:30:35.089 --> 00:30:35.330
No.

00:30:36.371 --> 00:30:39.416
And Byers was still the vice president for academic affairs.

00:30:40.277 --> 00:30:42.080
What about when Dr. Williams came?

00:30:42.681 --> 00:30:45.585
Do you remember any first impressions of him?

00:30:48.232 --> 00:30:49.774
Yeah.

00:30:52.839 --> 00:30:54.602
Most of them negative.

00:30:54.622 --> 00:30:55.183
Oh, really?

00:30:56.084 --> 00:31:03.616
Yeah, I never could identify with Williams for some reason.

00:31:03.637 --> 00:31:05.519
It just, I don't know what it was.

00:31:06.461 --> 00:31:12.771
But he appointed Calhoun as academic vice president.
