00:03.676 --> 00:19.614
First, Dr. Burns, tell us something about your 
early life, including the names of your parents,

00:03.676 --> 00:19.614
the dates of their birth and death, the place of 
their birth, the place and date of your birth, and

00:03.676 --> 00:19.614
the schools you attended before entering Texas 
A&M.

00:23.558 --> 00:29.705
I was born in DeWitt County, Quirrell. Lived out in 
the country a few miles from Quirrell. My father

00:34.658 --> 00:39.643
was Lewis L. Burns. He died in

00:41.925 --> 01:01.363
February 1928,

00:41.925 --> 01:01.363
and he was 76 years old and nine months. That would 
make his birthday. 1851.

01:11.212 --> 01:19.922
My mother was Anna Wright and this was my father's 
second wife. His first wife died

01:20.042 --> 01:31.976
when she was about 30 or 35 years old.

01:31.996 --> 01:33.117
My mother had two children. I have a sister eight 
years older than I.

01:40.378 --> 01:47.787
And my mother died in 1856, lacked just a few months 
of being 90 years old. When you said 1856, you meant

01:50.390 --> 01:52.933
1956. I beg your pardon, 1956. I

01:54.615 --> 02:01.163
don't recall her exact date of birth, year. I was 
born on October 16, 1901. Were you born in DeWitt

02:14.373 --> 02:16.715
County? In DeWitt County. And do you remember 
where your parents were born?

02:22.962 --> 02:28.428
My father was born

02:22.962 --> 02:28.428
in DeWitt County. My mother was point in DeWitt 
County.

02:38.393 --> 02:41.157
Did you go to school in Cuero or did you have a rural 
school? No, I went to school in Cuero. Rode to

02:43.720 --> 02:44.561
Horsback. How many miles? Oh, about three and a 
half or four. I rode in a buggy and through the

02:51.949 --> 02:58.977
fourth grade with my sister and then she finished 
high school in 1912. And I finished in 1919. I rode a

03:02.581 --> 03:07.287
horseback the remaining years. Was that, what, 11 
years in the high school, or did you have 12? Eleven

03:12.193 --> 03:16.780
years.

03:16.800 --> 03:17.040
Okay. What factors were involved in your choice of 
Texas A&M as a school?

03:26.833 --> 03:28.695
Perhaps my father's love for it. He used to come to 
these... Farmers Congress, as they called them

03:30.614 --> 03:33.037
then.

03:36.420 --> 03:44.168
Oh, perhaps not every year, but frequently.

03:44.188 --> 03:55.440
And

03:44.188 --> 03:55.440
from the time I could talk or walk, I think I was 
destined to come to A&M.

03:58.542 --> 04:04.411
How did you choose animal husbandry as your major? 
I didn't choose it at first. My father asked me on

04:05.853 --> 04:15.407
the way to the train, and I came up here as a freshman 
in September 1919, what course I was going to take.

04:16.328 --> 04:18.652
I said, well, I think I'll take electrical 
engineering. And I did for one semester. Realized

04:24.761 --> 04:26.203
that I was interested mainly in math. Math was my 
favorite subject in high school. And I was never

04:33.525 --> 04:38.932
interested in the practical applications of 
electrical engineering. I realized I'd probably

04:40.354 --> 04:49.788
end up teaching algebra and teaching was just a 
jumping off place as far as I was concerned. I

04:51.871 --> 04:57.118
wasn't interested and so I wrote to my father for 
permission to Changed courses and being a miner at

04:57.706 --> 05:02.491
that time. And took animal husbandry. Finished in 
1923. Why did you choose animal husbandry? That's

05:12.222 --> 05:14.185
kind of far removed from math. I guess because I was 
born on a farm and ranch. And that had been my life up

05:22.754 --> 05:25.317
until then.

05:30.899 --> 05:36.105
Had you ever come to the campus with your father 
when he attended any of the congresses? No. So you

05:37.066 --> 05:42.813
had no firsthand knowledge of the area when you 
arrived? No. What were your first reactions to the

05:44.375 --> 05:48.900
school and to the community when you did get here? 
Well, I guess with most freshmen it was entirely

05:50.562 --> 05:57.911
new life. It was a big change for me. But I guess they 
agreed with me and I picked up weight and grew a

06:01.223 --> 06:10.432
little bit.

06:10.452 --> 06:14.015
Were there any people to meet the train when you 
arrived?

06:17.359 --> 06:18.420
Any upperclassmen? Well, some freshmen were put 
off the train at Navasota. How I escaped, I don't

06:23.985 --> 06:25.406
know. Some were taken off, got off at Hempstead. at 
Hempstead, some Navasota, and some Welborn. And

06:34.143 --> 06:39.856
how I managed to get to College Station, I don't 
know. You say they were taken off with this by

06:40.538 --> 06:43.304
upperclassmen? Yes. I've been told that at one 
point there were people who met the train to try to

06:45.149 --> 06:55.925
recruit you for a particular military unit and 
thereby a dormitory. No, not in my case. And I've

06:59.911 --> 07:05.540
also been told that there were people who met the 
train to sell freshman tickets to take a shower. I

07:07.443 --> 07:08.585
didn't have that experience. You didn't have that 
experience,

07:08.605 --> 07:13.452
okay. I'm not sure how widespread or how long that 
may have lasted, how widespread that may have been

07:14.697 --> 07:21.585
or how long it may have lasted.

07:27.091 --> 07:31.396
What dormitory were you assigned to then as a 
freshman? Mitchell Hall, and I was in the signal

07:31.416 --> 07:34.339
corps. Did you have a choice in that? Yes, I chose 
it, and when I switched to animal husbandry, My

07:45.612 --> 07:53.444
roommate did the same thing, so we

07:45.612 --> 07:53.444
transferred to Company I infantry.

07:56.349 --> 07:57.952
Was that because of your change of major? Oh yes, 
you had to be an electrical engineering major to be

07:58.272 --> 08:03.400
in signal corps. I see. Then did you get a choice 
into which infantry company you transferred, or

08:06.164 --> 08:12.835
did they just assign you to one that had an opening? 
I don't recall, but there

08:14.468 --> 08:26.492
were several students from my hometown in Company 
I. Perhaps that was a factor in the choice.

08:34.820 --> 08:39.305
Then when you switched to Company I Infantry, what 
dorm did you go to? Bazell Hall. And that was what,

08:40.426 --> 08:43.730
second half of your freshman year? Yes. Well, 
having been in those two relatively new dorms, you

08:46.153 --> 08:54.302
missed out on all the good things like carrying 
water and wood and so forth for the upper class.

08:54.322 --> 08:57.085
Yes, that was Austin Pfeiffer. Ross. Ross Foster, 
I believe. Yes. Wow. Did you... What kinds of

09:03.575 --> 09:07.540
things did you have to do for upperclassmen in the 
newer dorms?

09:14.410 --> 09:15.852
Oh, I don't recall. Making up beds, sweeping out,

09:17.154 --> 09:31.253
and

09:17.154 --> 09:31.253
that's about all I recall. Running errands. 
Running errands, such as? Well, some were

09:38.791 --> 09:53.927
foolish, and to carry things from Bazell Hall, 
say, down to Milner or Leggett, the other end of the

09:38.791 --> 09:53.927
campus, which wasn't very far.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.873
But if you had to do it several times, it probably 
seemed far. What other dormitories did you live

10:01.253 --> 10:02.936
in?

10:08.063 --> 10:19.681
During the sophomore year, I switched to the Air 
Service, the old Air Service, and quite a few in

10:08.063 --> 10:19.681
company. I went to the Cavalry when it was 
organized, and some went to

10:31.814 --> 10:37.420
the air service and we were assigned a room in Ross 
Hall.

10:40.783 --> 10:47.851
So then the air service and the cavalry were 
created during your sophomore year or at the

10:40.783 --> 10:47.851
beginning of it? The air service was. But the 
cavalry was earlier than that. I think so. I

10:58.942 --> 10:59.863
believe in the fall of 1920, if I'm not mistaken. 
I'm not sure.

11:17.118 --> 11:19.503
So then your sophomore year, you lived in Ross. The 
latter part, yes. The latter part. Okay. Oh, so

11:26.557 --> 11:32.765
then the switch to the air service was not made in 
the fall of the supplement. May I make a correction

11:32.785 --> 11:34.787
there? We made our choice in the spring of 21,

11:35.769 --> 11:50.607
but we actually, my roommates were juniors. And we 
roomed in Ross Hall during my junior year, not

11:50.823 --> 11:56.131
sophomore year. Not sophomore year. Okay, do you 
remember where it was in your sophomore year? In

11:59.276 --> 12:00.177
Bazell Hall. In Bazell Hall. They dissolved 
Company I, and we were in Company

12:04.564 --> 12:13.437
H, I believe. I'm not positive. Okay. Where were 
you then as a senior? in Foster Hall. So you had two

12:24.890 --> 12:29.696
of the old ones during that time. How was the life in 
the dormitory? Was it pretty crowded? How many

12:33.221 --> 12:37.667
roommates did you have?

12:37.687 --> 12:41.733
As a freshman in the Mitchell Hall, there were 
three of us.

12:46.439 --> 12:48.302
Two of us were freshmen, one sophomore. wasn't too 
good an arrangement for the two freshmen.

12:55.018 --> 12:56.040
Convenient for the sophomore. For the fish. And

12:57.661 --> 13:06.010
in Vazell Hall, as a freshman, there were only two 
of us. Both fish? Both of us were fish. In the

13:13.217 --> 13:19.183
sophomore year, three of us sophomores roomed 
together. In the junior year in Ross Hall, three of

13:21.138 --> 13:29.547
us roomed together in triple-deckers, 
triple-deck beds.

13:32.210 --> 13:39.198
And then as a senior, I roomed in Foster Hall. We 
were the overflow of the Air Service, the

13:39.218 --> 13:49.069
remaining most

13:39.218 --> 13:49.069
of the unit. were housed

13:50.399 --> 13:56.026
in Pfeiffer. So Air Service had all old 
dormitories. But do I understand it correctly

13:59.992 --> 14:19.377
that there was an annual almost musical 
dormitories that the various company's military

13:59.992 --> 14:19.377
units shifted from one dormitory to another each 
year so that the same company didn't have the same

13:59.992 --> 14:19.377
old dormitory each year? Or do you recall?

14:25.871 --> 14:30.597
Not that I recall.

14:30.617 --> 14:33.680
Someone had indicated to me that he understood 
this as the way it was. It might have been true, but I

14:33.701 --> 14:35.703
don't recall. Of course, it may have changed at 
times, too. They might have. Because the infantry

14:39.828 --> 14:47.997
occupied Brazil and Goodwin for years.

14:50.643 --> 14:52.787
You mentioned your triple-decker beds. Did the 
college make them triple-decker, or did the

14:53.368 --> 14:58.135
students do that? We had the

15:00.499 --> 15:16.566
metal for a double-decker, but we had to improvise 
on making the third one, stocking the third one on

15:00.499 --> 15:16.566
top of the other two. How did you decide who got 
which of the levels? We drew straws. Yes, that's as

15:25.176 --> 15:28.119
fair a way as any, isn't it? Odd man out, or we drew 
for it. I imagine depending upon the season of the

15:32.864 --> 15:40.532
year, one level would certainly be more desirable 
than the other, would it not?

15:43.775 --> 15:44.456
I don't know. I happen to be the middle. draw the 
middle ducker both years, so I don't know.

15:53.976 --> 15:57.080
Probably got a little warm on the top one. Which 
bottom one might be a little cool in the

15:58.762 --> 16:01.065
wintertime. That's right. And it might be the most 
desirable one in the summer, in the warmer weather

16:01.826 --> 16:06.412
though. Yes. And the top one I imagine would be hot 
always, summer or winter, up near the ceiling.

16:20.418 --> 16:23.942
You mentioned earlier that during your freshman 
year you gained some weight. This would indicate

16:23.962 --> 16:27.687
that the food in the mess hall was probably 
wholesome.

16:31.311 --> 16:33.393
Well, sometimes you didn't get all the dessert. 
You may not have had good pies, you just had to look

16:34.014 --> 16:39.461
at them. But we got plenty of prunes. In fact, the 
sophomores saved the prunes for the fish, for

16:45.087 --> 16:49.092
prune races. And we got a little box of sun-made 
raisins, one every day. And

16:57.291 --> 17:19.939
the students would frequently, on picture show 
nights,

16:57.291 --> 17:19.939
get the old, what they call the air dome, the open, 
located just about where the all-face chapel is

16:57.291 --> 17:19.939
now, a little bit south of that. between that and 
either law or prayer year.

17:29.990 --> 17:51.175
And then they'd have,

17:29.990 --> 17:51.175
throw these raisins,

17:29.990 --> 17:51.175
and then if they had potatoes, or they'd save their 
potatoes, ice potatoes, take them over to the, I

17:29.990 --> 17:51.175
don't, and get to throwing those at each other. And 
it was pretty slimy to get out of there. The floors

18:02.447 --> 18:05.111
got pretty thick. You mentioned prune races. 
Could you describe what a prune race was? It was

18:12.000 --> 18:19.390
merely, I guess, sophomores, particularly those 
who didn't care for prunes, but saved them. or the

18:20.939 --> 18:34.505
upperclassmen in general, and then they'd pick 
out some of the fish and see who could eat the most

18:20.939 --> 18:34.505
prunes in the shortest time.

18:37.370 --> 18:38.512
What happened to the loser? I don't recall that. 
How would you, you know, if you were going to kind of

18:45.138 --> 19:02.561
give a general summation to the food in the mess 
hall, well, let's see, the motels are, and the tour

18:45.138 --> 19:02.561
books describe them as one, two, three, and four 
stars. On up, you know, four stars would be top

19:04.103 --> 19:07.688
quality. How would you rate the food overall? I 
thought it did all of us good, but they didn't have

19:12.526 --> 19:17.913
the variety they do now. I think the menu has 
improved immensely since those days, but

19:18.353 --> 19:32.972
I never did see too much wrong. I still think the 
mess hall makes the best fruit pies I ever ate. I

19:40.437 --> 19:45.705
imagine the lack of variety in a mess hall was not at 
all unusual, though. Well, it cooked in large

19:47.408 --> 19:49.772
quantities. It didn't taste like it did at home. 
But

19:52.075 --> 19:58.926
I didn't think it particularly bad. What I was 
about to say is I would imagine that even at home you

19:59.447 --> 20:05.196
didn't get a whole lot of variety either. Probably 
not. I mean, you got vegetables in season,

20:06.629 --> 20:20.307
probably did some home canning, but it was 
probably not the variety of stuff that there is in

20:06.629 --> 20:20.307
the general public today.

20:25.314 --> 20:30.381
You mentioned the movies in the Air Dome. How 
frequently were they held? Saturday night, I'm

20:35.973 --> 20:37.434
sure. It seems to me that they had one during the 
week also. Did you have to pay for those or were they

20:42.319 --> 20:44.301
free? No, they cost us, I don't know, 10 or 15 cents. 
Quite reasonable. What other types of things did

20:53.049 --> 20:56.412
you do for recreation and entertainment?

20:59.975 --> 21:02.157
Well, there was always a game going on. Handball 
or...

21:10.313 --> 21:26.815
Of course, there weren't many tennis courts then,

21:10.313 --> 21:26.815
but playing football, basketball, and of course 
had company, or battalion football.

21:30.479 --> 21:36.607
The attendance was very good on those battalion 
games. In fact, I enjoyed battalion games as well.

21:41.195 --> 21:46.162
I did the varsity games.

21:46.182 --> 21:51.549
I had some indication from somebody that, what, I 
believe Bible was coached when you were here? Yes.

21:52.730 --> 21:56.335
That he attended those quite regularly and picked 
out a few football players. That's right. From

21:57.116 --> 21:57.637
those. I guess at that point there was not the 
terrific amount of scouting and recruiting that

21:59.079 --> 22:09.733
we have today, so he pretty much had to pick his team 
from... those who showed up for practice, and then

22:10.304 --> 22:22.775
if he could pick a few others out from the... Was it 
called intramural then, or was it... No, I don't

22:10.304 --> 22:22.775
think it was called intramural. They called it 
battalion. Battalion football, battalion

22:25.197 --> 22:32.504
basketball, and battalion cross-country.

22:38.329 --> 22:39.450
About walking... Plenty of places to walk around 
here. What about swimming? No, the only swimming

22:45.686 --> 22:52.638
pool that I know of was in the YMCA, in the basement 
of the YMCA. Eventually it was covered over and

22:54.501 --> 23:04.999
I've forgotten what, I think they made offices 
over there. Was Casey's confectionery still

23:06.515 --> 23:11.182
there when you were a student? Oh, yes. It was going 
strong. In fact, I think it had been there, I don't

23:13.746 --> 23:27.106
know when that was organized, a year or two before, 
but I think Bill Sparks was in the class of 18, I

23:13.746 --> 23:27.106
believe. I'm not sure. Now, was he the one who 
operated there? He and Casey both. In fact,

23:37.160 --> 23:37.500
Mr. Lavender, who operated the YMCA barbershop,

23:37.520 --> 23:51.434
I think sold his share in that for $1 to Bill Sparks. 
And I think Bill had that, or Mr. Lavender had that

23:55.277 --> 23:59.942
framed.

24:00.382 --> 24:06.728
But Bill and Casey were pretty good partners.

24:10.370 --> 24:13.554
Did students go to Bryan very much? By trolley or 
walk. They frequently go to Bryan on Saturday

24:18.479 --> 24:34.538
afternoon to a picture show or just to be going 
somewhere and they had a

24:18.479 --> 24:34.538
trailer, an open trailer to the to the streetcar. 
The streetcar, they were hanging from the

24:37.323 --> 24:41.968
streetcar, and they put the trailer on. And over 
about halfway between here and Bryan, coming

24:44.611 --> 24:54.601
back, why, somebody from the upper car would 
unhook it.

24:58.045 --> 25:05.453
And sometimes, a little while before the skipper, 
would realize he didn't have the load he was

25:06.665 --> 25:11.491
supposed to. He'd back up and pick us up. But it 
reminded me, the

25:15.796 --> 25:36.081
cable cars in San Francisco, the way they hang on to 
that reminded me of the way they did the old

25:15.796 --> 25:36.081
streetcar, and the trailer particularly.

25:36.533 --> 25:38.535
It had a roof but open sides. Did they have the 
trailer just on like Saturdays when they were
