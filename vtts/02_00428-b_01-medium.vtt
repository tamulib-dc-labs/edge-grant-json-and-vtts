WEBVTT

00:01.820 --> 00:02.180
Okay. Because of personality defects, a few 
people didn't get along very well with them. And

00:08.690 --> 00:19.464
interestingly enough, the Venezuelan officers 
pretty much expected perfection from us,

00:08.690 --> 00:19.464
although they'd accept less for themselves. I 
thought that was an interesting relationship.

00:26.525 --> 00:36.599
If you really applied yourself in trying to help 
them and doing the job you were there to do, they

00:26.525 --> 00:36.599
appreciated it and they respected you for it.

00:38.481 --> 00:45.131
They had the idea that some of the people were there 
to enjoy their life rather than work. But some of

00:45.151 --> 00:46.192
the Americans were. Some of the Americans, but 
that's not really true. What really happened,

00:48.295 --> 00:52.060
this personality thing worked both ways, but 
There were a few cases in which Venezuelan

00:53.660 --> 01:00.890
commanders simply didn't want this advisor 
around for whatever reason. And so they became

01:03.374 --> 01:09.883
ineffective because they weren't accepted, not 
because of personality or anything of the sort.

01:09.923 --> 01:16.453
They just didn't want that advice or help or 
interference, however they looked upon it. And it

01:16.473 --> 01:20.038
was easy to be put in a position of interference.

01:25.807 --> 01:34.200
you know, tried not to distinguish, and that 
almost got me in trouble one time, but basically I

01:25.807 --> 01:34.200
think it was sound. Okay, will you tell me about 
that one time? Well, I would just say very briefly

01:37.405 --> 01:52.388
that, yes, I won't go into detail, but in my core, in 
the course of my learning Spanish, I also picked up

01:37.405 --> 01:52.388
colloquialisms,

01:37.405 --> 01:52.388
and It's interesting that in Spanish, and I 
suppose this to some degree is true in English, but

01:52.587 --> 02:06.659
these colloquialisms mean different things to 
different people depending on what country

01:52.587 --> 02:06.659
you're from. I know Venezuelans who come in to me, 
they were very careful when they went to Mexico of

02:06.799 --> 02:16.608
how they used certain terms because they meant 
different things. Some of them bugger it. And I

02:19.691 --> 02:22.273
also learned after the fact that some of their 
colloquialism used in common, ordinary

02:23.283 --> 02:31.270
conversation under certain circumstances is 
very damaging. And I was guilty of doing that. He

02:35.994 --> 02:51.248
said, he thought, an officer thought that I'd 
insulted him by using such a colloquialism when I

02:35.994 --> 02:51.248
was, appeared to be angry to him, which was under 
such circumstances, if intentional, would have

02:35.994 --> 02:51.248
been an insult. Anyway, he made an official 
complaint that resulted in an investigation

02:52.780 --> 03:04.314
that,

02:52.780 --> 03:04.314
because he'd complained, it had to be reported 
formally. And I was completely exonerated as

03:04.374 --> 03:14.607
having been not at all intentional

03:04.374 --> 03:14.607
in misusing that word. In fact, didn't understand 
it. And to a man, the Venezuelan officers that

03:16.289 --> 03:21.555
testified supported my innocence. And I, of 
course, appreciate that because I think that's a

03:23.619 --> 03:31.070
little bit difficult to do when a foreign 
officer's involved. And it turned out not to be a

03:31.191 --> 03:36.018
big thing, but it did bother me a great deal at the 
time. And it could have been damaging for your

03:37.139 --> 03:39.082
career. It could have been very damaging, as it 
was. I wish I had asked for a copy of that report

03:41.486 --> 03:49.197
because that would have probably been... of more 
value in my file than the efficiency report I got

03:50.324 --> 03:56.510
from my boss, as it were. Because the Venezuelans 
supported you so much. Yeah. Then we left there.

04:02.236 --> 04:06.099
Well, I was wondering, before we leave there, is 
that school still in existence? It is, and as a

04:06.880 --> 04:20.213
matter of fact, my wife and I, Fran and I, were 
invited back ten years later as guests to the

04:06.880 --> 04:20.213
Venezuelan Army to observe the tenth year

04:20.463 --> 04:29.232
observance of the formation of that school.

04:29.392 --> 04:34.017
We were asked to stay for a month, and we stayed, I 
think, ten days. We were just royally treated.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.401
They did have a fine ceremony. Incidentally, 
Lieutenant Colonel Quevedo, who

04:39.422 --> 04:49.913
was the first commandant at this point, was 
commander-in-chief of the Army. of Venezuela.

04:53.352 --> 05:19.275
And interestingly enough,

04:53.352 --> 05:19.275
when Pérez Jiménez, the dictator, was kicked out 
in, I believe it was 1954,

04:53.352 --> 05:19.275
Coveto was one of the three-man junta that 
reorganized the government, decreed the

04:53.352 --> 05:19.275
Constitutional Convention that set up the 
present government form under the present

05:19.762 --> 05:27.550
Constitution, which provided for two houses of 
Congress, a president serving a five-year tour.

05:27.651 --> 05:38.262
In other words, our basic pattern of the executive 
legislative judicial

05:27.651 --> 05:38.262
got a commitment from the armed forces. The 
Minister of Defense proclaimed that never again

05:38.282 --> 05:47.592
would the Venezuelan armed forces be used against 
the government, only to support the government.

05:49.529 --> 05:56.357
And they're now in their fifth five-year 
presidency without interruption or serious

05:49.529 --> 05:56.357
incident. Incidentally, General Collado became 
a senator. He did? After he retired from the Army in

06:03.745 --> 06:10.914
this system that he helped create. And I consider 
him a patriot. What kind of man is Govedo? Oh, he's a

06:16.371 --> 06:18.354
fine man. He's very likable and very personal.

06:23.881 --> 06:40.883
Just from his physical appearance, and I don't 
know this to be the case, but I would say he's half

06:23.881 --> 06:40.883
Indian, or he's got a lot of Indian blood in him, but 
he's a good native son, and he was a very effective

06:23.881 --> 06:40.883
and popular officer, and obviously able to handle 
the high position of responsibility that he found

06:43.259 --> 06:49.686
himself in as a member of the governing junta. Was 
he from a wealthy family? No. Most of the

06:53.530 --> 06:56.052
Venezuelan officers are not from wealthy 
families. Some are.

06:59.716 --> 07:10.127
Many of them, of course, their social status is 
improved by going through the academy and

06:59.716 --> 07:10.127
becoming an officer.

07:11.373 --> 07:18.823
I went to Venezuela on business a couple of times in 
about 1975 and 1977, I guess it was. On that return

07:20.665 --> 07:27.514
in 1975, I had a wonderful experience of 
recontacting many of these officers. My very best

07:27.574 --> 07:33.602
friend that I made there was Enrique Peña Briseño. 
He was a lieutenant when I arrived in Venezuela,

07:33.662 --> 07:37.347
and he became a general officer. And so we had a good 
reunion there. I'd had a reunion with him in

07:40.232 --> 07:45.340
Washington and Rome in the intervening years. We 
maintained this friendship, he and others. But he

07:48.745 --> 07:50.968
was my best Venezuelan friend. Anyway, most of 
those officers in that first class that I

07:52.671 --> 08:00.924
conducted became general officers. It was 
remarkable.

08:04.563 --> 08:24.969
And as a matter of fact, when I went back there in 75, 
General Cabello was then retired, and he hosted a

08:04.563 --> 08:24.969
reception, cocktail reception, for me, and 
invited all of these people and their wives that he

08:04.563 --> 08:24.969
could get in touch with. And it was just a wonderful 
reunion. Of course, we'd done this on that ten year

08:29.993 --> 08:36.340
anniversary too, so you can see the continuity has 
been maintained rather surprisingly well. Now

08:37.241 --> 08:43.388
there were a couple of events that were very 
important on the international scene when you

08:37.241 --> 08:43.388
were in Venezuela. One was the Korean War. Did you 
want to go to the war? Did you volunteer? No, I

08:47.793 --> 08:50.315
didn't volunteer. I arrived in Venezuela six 
months before that war started.

08:58.968 --> 09:04.154
I left there in 1952 and all of the intensive 
purchases were over. We have in the Army what you

09:04.174 --> 09:09.161
call a stabilized tour. In other words, you're 
sent there and you won't be moved until that tour is

09:09.261 --> 09:13.586
completed. But this was a peculiar one in 
Venezuela. We were under contract with the

09:18.412 --> 09:20.635
Venezuelan Army. As a matter of fact, the 
Venezuelan Army paid me, in addition to my Army

09:21.196 --> 09:27.203
pay, $250,000. $87 a month. What that was was not a 
salary, that was a cost of living differential,

09:32.538 --> 09:43.388
but it was kind of a hold on us, you see, and a 
contract with us. So, I was in effect pinned down

09:43.408 --> 09:50.714
there those three years. Of course, one of the 
major events in recent military history was the

09:51.475 --> 09:58.641
firing of General MacArthur. What did you think of 
Truman's action?

10:03.145 --> 10:10.494
I'm a great admirer of General MacArthur's, and I 
think he's one of the greatest generals we ever

10:03.145 --> 10:10.494
produced. He's one of the greatest strategists 
we've ever produced. I felt President Truman was

10:15.560 --> 10:18.684
correct. He had to do what he did. Very simple. 
After all, he's commander-in-chief. If it had

10:26.212 --> 10:27.514
been MacArthur and him, Lieutenant General down 
below him had been the same thing. Anytime a

10:32.748 --> 10:43.679
subordinate cannot accept the policy direction 
of his superior, he's got to resign or get fired,

10:32.748 --> 10:43.679
one or the other. He got fired.

10:48.383 --> 10:50.545
I never had any question about it, much as I 
regretted it.

10:53.568 --> 10:54.569
Okay. Let's move on now. After this, you went to 
student at the U.S. Command and General Staff

10:56.637 --> 11:03.365
College from August 1952 to July 1953. This is a 
very important event in your career advancement,

11:03.646 --> 11:10.174
isn't it? It is. And that's probably the most 
useful school training that I received in the

11:12.096 --> 11:19.325
Army. And I did attend, of course, the artillery 
school and the war college as well. in some special

11:26.523 --> 11:27.845
schools. But anyway— You thought it was more 
important than the War College? I do, and I'll tell

11:31.191 --> 11:33.375
you why. Good. It was very demanding of time. 
Incidentally, our second child daughter was born

11:36.219 --> 11:39.545
at Leavenworth. Our first child son was born in 
Venezuela.

11:46.577 --> 11:50.383
I thought of that because I had so little time to 
enjoy our baby daughter. I was so busy. Our son, by

11:53.658 --> 12:00.925
the way, had a dual citizenship, and he had to make a 
choice at the age of eighteen, according to

11:53.658 --> 12:00.925
Venezuelan law. And, of course, the choice was 
easy, the choice of citizenship. The Command and

12:07.471 --> 12:21.825
General Staff College prepares officers for 
general staff work at all levels, and it prepares

12:07.471 --> 12:21.825
him for command of units through the division and 
corps. You know, we have the company battalion,

12:28.631 --> 12:41.289
regiment, or brigade, brigade now, division, 
corps, and field army. Well, this brought the

12:41.309 --> 12:48.458
students through the division and corps phase of 
planning and commanding. It was very demanding,

12:50.081 --> 12:52.504
the very because we were always moving at a pace 
that you could never quite finish the race before,

12:53.615 --> 13:03.409
today's race, before the bar starts. And it was 
planned that way. And it's rather disconcerting,

13:05.452 --> 13:11.360
but it's surprising after it's all over how much of 
that exposure you retain. But it was just an

13:11.400 --> 13:16.407
excellent, very best instruction, too, 
quality-wise. But it, I felt, prepared me for just

13:17.669 --> 13:22.035
about any job that I'd be assigned in the Army. It 
gave me a good base to begin any assignment in the

13:23.197 --> 13:31.387
Army. How would you compare that with two years 
later when you went to the Army War College? Well,

13:36.133 --> 13:39.898
it was two assignments later that I went to the Army 
War College. August 1956 to November 1950. Well,

13:41.460 --> 13:50.892
the War College, I think they're very 
complementary, but if I had to choose one as being

13:41.460 --> 13:50.892
the most important, the most valuable to me, it was 
the Command Staff College. The War College, on the

13:51.614 --> 14:02.765
other hand, is the level at which you study 
national strategy and military strategy. So you

14:02.785 --> 14:09.992
see, it complements, it picks up basically where 
the Command Staff College leaves off, and that's

14:02.785 --> 14:09.992
the way it's designed. I thought the experience in 
the

14:11.593 --> 14:17.138
War College was invaluable.

14:19.461 --> 14:20.862
It was the first time since I entered the Army, that 
I and my contemporaries who sat with me there had

14:21.702 --> 14:39.222
the opportunity, the time, and the environment to 
really think policy strategy.

14:43.547 --> 14:50.055
Now, strange as it may seem, if you're on the road 
that far, you're always so, or I was always so

14:50.828 --> 14:57.234
committed to the job that you just had to deal with 
what was at hand, you know. Sure. So it was a

14:58.916 --> 15:00.257
wonderful experience. We used seminars and 
committees and lectures, and there was plenty of

15:00.577 --> 15:14.390
time for individual thought and committee and 
contribution to the committee work. And we'd

15:16.812 --> 15:18.574
treat with a series of, aspects of national and 
military strategy policy and strategy through

15:19.533 --> 15:45.793
the year and so it was just a very fine rounding of uh 
for example i left uh between leavenworth the

15:19.533 --> 15:45.793
command staff college and the war cars i went to the 
pentagon that's my first full tour on the army

15:19.533 --> 15:45.793
staff and i was in a position there to to observe 
this policy and strategy in action because I wound

15:46.634 --> 16:05.120
up as assistant executive officer to the chief 
planning officer of the Army, planning and

15:46.634 --> 16:05.120
operations officer of the Army, the G3, General 
James Gavin at the time I joined that office. And,

16:05.140 --> 16:15.375
of course,

16:05.140 --> 16:15.375
never had in the course of my job to really—and it 
wasn't my position to—to really making my own

16:16.334 --> 16:21.601
judgment on some of these things that were so 
important to the Army and the nation. But when I got

16:21.861 --> 16:27.628
to the War College, then we were told to look at 
these things, and particularly look to the

16:21.861 --> 16:27.628
future. Sure. And make up, get our own 
convictions. You asked me in conversation if I

16:33.235 --> 16:41.526
thought it was practical to have tactical,

16:33.235 --> 16:41.526
use tactical nuclear weapons in war. Mm-hmm. I 
came to the conclusion as a student at War College

16:42.592 --> 16:46.837
that it's going to be done someday. The question 
is, where does this nuclear exchange stop? I can't

16:57.851 --> 17:12.109
see, for example, the U.S. Army in Europe and its 
NATO allies accepting initial defeat by the

16:57.851 --> 17:12.109
Russians should they ever decide to make a 
conventional attack. I can't see them accepting

17:16.607 --> 17:25.896
initial defeat forward and give up East Germany 
because- I mean West Germany. I mean West Germany

17:25.916 --> 17:38.670
because there's no stopping point then once

17:25.916 --> 17:38.670
that West Germany is breached that I can see.

17:40.405 --> 18:10.345
think rather than accept such a defeat that we 
would use nuclear weapons which could stop the

17:40.405 --> 18:10.345
advance of those forces because of the geography 
and character of the terrain that they've got to

17:40.405 --> 18:10.345
come over

17:40.405 --> 18:10.345
but at the same time they're then going to bring 
them into play and where does this stop and that is

17:40.405 --> 18:10.345
what gives credence to the deterrence of these 
vast nuclear weapons we have that that i say must

17:40.405 --> 18:10.345
never be used So I guess rather than hoping, I'm 
reasoning that we will have effective

18:10.578 --> 18:35.421
deterrents, because it's unthinkable that we 
would let the use of small tactical nuclear

18:10.578 --> 18:35.421
weapons evolve into increasing exchanges that 
wind up with an exchange of thermonuclear

18:10.578 --> 18:35.421
weapons. It's suicide. These are the types of 
issues that you discuss. Those are the types of

18:42.212 --> 18:44.614
issues that we discuss. Plus, for example, at the 
War College. I remember another one. I came to the

18:50.500 --> 18:59.910
conclusion, and each has his own opportunity, you 
know, make his own conclusions, that we should

18:50.500 --> 18:59.910
make our peace with Communist China.

19:03.473 --> 19:07.197
We could not hope to survive a concerted, joint, 
opposition militarily or between China and

19:07.885 --> 19:36.846
Russia against us joint their joint undertaking 
against us they could overrun the vast areas of the

19:07.885 --> 19:36.846
world that are so important to us that it would 
reduce us to to unimportance

19:07.885 --> 19:36.846
but we better see to it that through the United 
Nations or otherwise we get this fester of

19:07.885 --> 19:36.846
hormosis settled And the best way seemed to be to 
get Formosa declared an independent nation with

19:37.653 --> 19:46.242
some name other than China.

19:49.105 --> 19:52.508
Formosa wasn't China before the Communists took 
over. They were a province of China. Chiang

19:58.895 --> 20:03.139
Kai-shek made it China. Well, this never 
happened, so you see where we are now. We have made

20:05.642 --> 20:07.103
our peace with China, but we haven't resolved that 
matter of Formosa, and that will always be a debit

20:07.927 --> 20:17.818
on our account until it's settled.

20:22.843 --> 20:24.865
That's just another example. Let's go to the 
Pentagon. This is the first chance you had to move

20:26.247 --> 20:31.352
into the Pentagon. This is the hub of the military, 
and you moved there in July 1953 and stayed until

20:31.957 --> 20:39.624
August 1956 in two different jobs. Let's describe 
those jobs to begin with. Staff officer,

20:43.066 --> 20:48.331
organization and training division, office of 
assistant chief of staff. Yes. Of course, the

20:50.773 --> 21:01.322
function of the army general staff was to 
establish the policies for the army, promulgate

20:50.773 --> 21:01.322
the policies for the army. do the planning for the 
Army, overall planning, and the budgeting for the

21:02.180 --> 21:13.209
resources of the Army, procurement there of those 
resources. In the training field, which I was in

21:15.211 --> 21:22.537
initially, we basically set training policy in 
that shop. We developed training policy to be

21:22.637 --> 21:28.843
promulgated by the Army Chief of Staff and 
Secretary of the Army. And this had to do with, at

21:28.863 --> 21:31.545
the time, Training sounds like a simple term, and 
it is, because in the course of our career, most of

21:33.263 --> 21:41.512
our time spent training. The interesting thing at 
the time, of course, was training in nuclear

21:41.972 --> 21:45.256
weapons. They were new to us. We still, in 1953, had 
not become accustomed to them, so that was one of

21:48.219 --> 21:58.630
the challenges, nuclear training. Of course, 
this is the time that the American Armed Forces are

21:59.369 --> 22:08.198
still having above-atmosphere bomb testing. 
Were you in any way involved with those tests? I was

22:11.001 --> 22:14.505
involved in the planning for them, yes, but I was 
never on site. Actually, one thing I wanted to do

22:14.585 --> 22:21.212
was to get on site and observe this nuclear weapon. 
I never had the opportunity. Of course, at that

22:24.295 --> 22:28.920
time, now we're reflecting, of course, on the The 
radiation. The radiation that may have been

22:31.686 --> 22:38.296
lasting effects, which are affecting the health 
of people who were there, and I'm sure that more is

22:31.686 --> 22:38.296
going to be learned of that. At the time, safety was 
a very, very important aspect of it, of course, and

22:39.598 --> 22:50.675
the extreme precautions were taken to shield the 
people. And, of course, safety is always primary

22:52.157 --> 22:56.764
in Well, just shooting artillery, for example, 
for practice. But I'm sure that, obviously, we've

23:03.032 --> 23:10.061
learned a lot about them since that we didn't know 
then. Now, I don't know really how to evaluate this

23:10.121 --> 23:23.236
problem because I've never seen the data on what we 
know now versus what we knew then on the

23:10.121 --> 23:23.236
penetration of this radiation. We were just in the 
exploratory phase as far as nuclear weapons and as

23:24.217 --> 23:29.063
far as— We had to learn. We had to learn more about 
this weapon, this family of weapons. And I thought

23:37.683 --> 23:58.543
at the time that these were very

23:37.683 --> 23:58.543
forward actions being taken, you know, and 
courageous in many ways to undertake those tests

23:37.683 --> 23:58.543
like we did to find out more about it. Now, what 
those dangers were, as we look back in retrospect,

23:58.895 --> 24:05.761
we're going to know more about, I'm sure, in short 
order. I believe the state and the legislature and

24:07.843 --> 24:28.041
the federal government have both recently passed 
bills that are going to create the resources to not

24:07.843 --> 24:28.041
only treat the people who've been affected, you 
know, to help them with their problem of

24:07.843 --> 24:28.041
treatment, and the Agent Orange people from 
Vietnam but also to study this more carefully so

24:28.814 --> 24:33.380
that we learn more. Well, in the last few years in 
the news, during the 1970s especially, some

24:34.081 --> 24:48.599
journalists and other commentators have charged 
that the Army was using their troops as guinea

24:34.081 --> 24:48.599
pigs. What's your opinion of those charges?

24:57.991 --> 25:01.315
Why don't we put that into English-specific 
terms? What's a guinea pig? Well, using human

25:02.637 --> 25:10.187
soldiers out there

25:02.637 --> 25:10.187
for experiments. I think that to some extent that 
was true because

25:10.367 --> 25:27.930
we were conducting those tests to see what the 
blast effects were on structures and troops.

25:29.058 --> 25:36.289
military equipment, what the heat effects were, 
what the radiation effects were. And I'm sure that

25:39.013 --> 25:42.598
to some extent that was the purpose of those troops 
being there. The other purpose was that they

25:42.718 --> 25:51.471
become, shall we say, oriented to some degree in 
what this really is.

25:52.784 --> 26:07.080
But the Army felt that it had to start, of course, 
positioning troops at an absolutely safe

25:52.784 --> 26:07.080
distance

25:52.784 --> 26:07.080
to measure the effects and not go closer than would 
be considered safe. Now, I'm sure if what is being

26:07.120 --> 26:15.088
implied that they were deliberately put into 
unsafe areas to see what the effects would be, that

26:07.120 --> 26:15.088
is not true. I think it's entirely possible that 
they were put into a position that was considered

26:16.410 --> 26:22.116
to be safe But the knowledge at the time led him to a 
bad judgment.

26:31.877 --> 26:41.931
What other types of testing besides nuclear, 
because you were an expert in artillery, were you

26:31.877 --> 26:41.931
also in charge of that at the Pentagon? No, being an 
artilleryman had nothing to do with mine. I was a

26:45.636 --> 26:51.985
general staff officer expected to handle any 
subject in my field.

26:56.538 --> 26:58.580
But you ask what else. At that time, of course, we 
were preparing an artillery nuclear weapon. At

27:04.767 --> 27:09.993
that time, we also were developing advanced 
chemical weapons. These are the tedious ones that

27:10.033 --> 27:14.038
come to mind.

27:16.921 --> 27:21.246
How successful were you in these developments?

27:22.981 --> 27:26.846
That's one of the things about serving in the 
Pentagon that is a bit frustrating. What you do

27:27.727 --> 27:44.989
there is seldom,

27:27.727 --> 27:44.989
particularly in the areas of planning and 
strategy, of course, the effects of what you've

27:27.727 --> 27:44.989
done is seldom seen within a matter of the time 
you're there. It's probably after you leave that

27:45.049 --> 27:48.533
the impact is really visible. That's 
particularly true in developments of new things.

27:53.948 --> 28:09.543
For example, I just read this morning in one of my 
military magazines that the field artillery's

27:53.948 --> 28:09.543
computerized fire direction system is now being 
deployed throughout the Army. When I was at Fort

28:12.185 --> 28:15.128
Selle in 1961 as chief of research and the 
development organization.

28:21.302 --> 28:27.890
We initiated that

28:21.302 --> 28:27.890
research on that specific system. And we 
developed computer programs to try out on

28:29.252 --> 28:35.219
commercial computers, because we didn't have any 
in the Army. And do you know that that was twenty

28:37.142 --> 28:38.964
years ago? Sure. That's an example of how long it 
takes to really realize what you started in

28:39.945 --> 28:45.452
development. It shouldn't have taken that long, I 
might add, and I think it's disgraceful that it

28:46.664 --> 28:51.892
did. And I think the major element in that is 
decision time. Do you think the Pentagon works too

28:58.983 --> 29:02.248
slowly, then? Without question.

29:07.816 --> 29:08.537
Why is that?

29:11.420 --> 29:12.662
I'm not a reactionary. I don't think we could go 
back to the old ways of doing things and do them

29:12.802 --> 29:16.567
better. But some of the principles that applied 
then certainly apply now. If we'd go back to the

29:24.598 --> 29:41.241
year that I entered the Army, 1941, the 
development of that computer system or its

29:24.598 --> 29:41.241
counterpart in those days would have been in the 
province of the chief of field artillery on the

29:24.598 --> 29:41.241
Army staff. And he would have made the basic 
decisions on it. And when he said, I've got

29:45.826 --> 29:52.813
something that's ready, the Chief of Staff of the 
Army and the Secretary of the Army would have made

29:45.826 --> 29:52.813
the final decision on it. And that would entail 
then the proper program, budget, and money to buy

29:53.214 --> 30:00.461
it, develop it and buy it. Today, the Secretary of 
Defense makes that decision. It's ridiculous.

30:06.547 --> 30:11.312
And when you count the Secretary of Defense or his 
deputies, When you count the treatment then of

30:12.338 --> 30:37.620
this problem between the guys at Fort Sill who are 
trying to develop this for the user in the field, or

30:12.338 --> 30:37.620
trying to get the requirements stated and get it 
developed, and count the contacts and the actions

30:12.338 --> 30:37.620
between him now under the present system and the 
Office of the Secretary of Defense, it's

30:12.338 --> 30:37.620
absolutely miraculous that anything ever gets 
out.

30:40.604 --> 30:53.577
It's the most disappointing thing, and by the way, 
we'll get down the line, I was in the development

30:40.604 --> 30:53.577
business as a major general before I went to the 
Pentagon as chief legislative liaison.

30:54.959 --> 30:59.043
And it's one of the most disappointing things in my 
service to see how encumbered we are.

31:02.287 --> 31:07.352
And it's a result of putting the dollar focus first 
on everything. Certainly you can't You can't

31:10.540 --> 31:12.503
ignore the dollar. God knows we can't afford the 
dollars we really need to prepare. But when you put

31:19.111 --> 31:38.757
the decisions on weapons and weapon-supporting 
systems,

31:19.111 --> 31:38.757
materiel, in the hands of civilians, I'm not 
questioning civilian authority, they can only

31:19.111 --> 31:38.757
think in terms of dollars because they don't 
understand the weapon system. Really. Really.

31:40.325 --> 31:43.409
how this is going to be used and what the real need 
is.

31:47.174 --> 32:06.601
And we're going to have to

31:47.174 --> 32:06.601
return to the principle that the user, the guy in 
uniform, has got the loudest voice and what is

31:47.174 --> 32:06.601
going to be produced for him or we're going to be in 
real trouble. We're already in real trouble. Now

32:09.350 --> 32:17.599
I'm critical of some of that CBS program recently 
on national security of the United States, but

32:09.350 --> 32:17.599
they pointed up some of these points. What was the 
difference between your first job from July 53 to

32:19.461 --> 32:32.074
April 54 and then April 54 to August 56 when you were 
shifted to assistant executive officer? What was

32:32.694 --> 32:35.357
the difference in that?

32:42.323 --> 32:43.685
assistant executive officer. Well, it's very 
different. And if you'd like, I'll outline what

32:49.372 --> 32:53.577
the assistant executive officer is. I was 
assistant to the executive officer. The

32:55.699 --> 33:02.948
executive officer was a colonel, and he's the man 
in the office of the assistant chief of staff, G-3.

33:03.289 --> 33:07.334
We had four general officers up there, the G-3 and 
three assistants. And that colonel was the fellow

33:09.830 --> 33:15.759
that they turned to to get this done or bring me this 
kind of advice and so forth. He was really his, you

33:16.219 --> 33:20.425
might say, if you could think of it, his chief of 
staff. The G3's chief of staff. And I was the

33:24.111 --> 33:26.554
assistant chief of staff in those terms. This 
meant that all this whole area of responsibility

33:28.798 --> 33:39.313
of training, operations, plans came to a focus at 
this office.

33:42.787 --> 33:50.895
And therefore,

33:42.787 --> 33:50.895
much of these actions, of course, are handled on 
paper and in specific formats. As a matter of fact,

33:52.236 --> 33:58.562
when a paper is put on one of those generous desks, 
the whole story is on the top sheet in summary. Then

33:58.882 --> 34:00.924
they can get into as much detail as he wants to. Only 
one sheet.

34:05.468 --> 34:08.051
One sheet of paper on the top. So did you do a lot of 
drafting then? No, I did the managing of getting it

34:10.208 --> 34:20.547
done and of getting into the details that they 
didn't want to deal with after they'd seen the

34:10.208 --> 34:20.547
summary. I had to read every one of those papers 
before it went into them. And then if they take

34:25.136 --> 34:34.613
whatever instruction they had with regard to that 
action after they had dealt with it, often I would

34:25.136 --> 34:34.613
take it in and actually present it to them 
verbally. In fact, I say often, that was more the

34:35.909 --> 34:44.678
rule than the exception. This meant that I had to 
prepare myself in that specific topic.

34:51.565 --> 34:59.653
There had been hundreds of staff hours of work, 
staff officers' work, gone into it in many cases

34:51.565 --> 34:59.653
because it's not just the guy preparing it. But he 
has to coordinate it with those who have an

34:59.733 --> 35:05.038
interest in it, not only in G-3 but G1 personnel or 
G2 intelligence or G4 logistics. And I felt a great

35:11.057 --> 35:21.951
responsibility that if I was going to go in there 
and present this for a decision that I understood

35:11.057 --> 35:21.951
it and that I presented it correctly. No general 
can sit there and read every one of these papers

35:23.113 --> 35:30.782
that have all that background behind that top 
sheet. So they'd want a briefing. So they'd want a

35:32.164 --> 35:34.367
briefing and that was the Many of these, of course, 
were very simple. Some of them were very complex

35:37.135 --> 35:39.818
and very important. But I could get so much of this 
out of their way and conserve the time of the staff

35:41.079 --> 35:57.719
officers who worked on it by preparing myself, 
taking in, presenting, and getting a decision,

35:41.079 --> 35:57.719
and I'd write out the decision to go back for 
implementation. I'd write out the decision made

35:57.739 --> 36:04.607
as expressed by the general officer who made the 
decision. Perhaps it was one he made a

36:05.617 --> 36:13.750
recommendation because it had to go on to the Chief 
of Staff, maybe the Secretary of the Army, maybe

36:05.617 --> 36:13.750
the Secretary of Defense, depending. Some even to 
the President occasionally. So anyway, I was just

36:17.876 --> 36:33.160
a flunky, but at the same time I got into the stream 
of information on this and knowledge and

36:17.876 --> 36:33.160
consideration on it by virtue of the fact that I was 
an administrator

36:17.876 --> 36:33.160
who was presenting the problems in many instances 
to the decision-maker. Now, in some of these very

36:36.757 --> 36:56.700
complex cases, it would be clear to me that I should 
not present it because it takes so much

36:36.757 --> 36:56.700
preparation, background, and knowledge on the 
subject that I would simply call the division

36:36.757 --> 36:56.700
chief concerned and request that they present it. 
They present it, having dealt with it, by briefing

37:02.215 --> 37:05.679
to the General and then set it up with the General. 
Now did your opinion of the Pentagon and the

37:05.699 --> 37:18.634
workings of the Pentagon change before you went to 
the Pentagon and while you were there and after you

37:05.699 --> 37:18.634
left? Did my opinion change? Yeah. What did you 
think of how the Army was run?

37:31.055 --> 37:34.818
sort of a parallel to my description of going back 
to A&M on the staff. You know, at a distance you

37:34.838 --> 37:47.610
respect higher authority and don't know the 
details and don't realize that there are some

37:34.838 --> 37:47.610
little fights and fusses and rough spots that you 
never see, but when you're there you see them. But I

37:47.630 --> 37:53.556
was very proud of the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the Army staff. The more I came to

37:53.576 --> 37:58.120
know it, the more I believed in it as a system, and it 
is a system. Sure. that we used was basically

38:01.328 --> 38:05.694
created with the Germans, you know. And it's 
sound. It's been used for years and years. I do

38:09.018 --> 38:30.306
think that

38:09.018 --> 38:30.306
subsequently

38:09.018 --> 38:30.306
we've gotten off to excellence because we don't 
have

38:09.018 --> 38:30.306
a general staff system really anymore. we have the 
whiz kids staff system the McNamara system we'll

38:31.096 --> 39:01.002
get to McNamara we'll give you a full chance it's 
confused the lines of action and staffing

38:31.096 --> 39:01.002
procedures so that well it's what adds these years 
to our getting where we want to go in my opinion now

38:31.096 --> 39:01.002
we'll get to McNamara we're going to talk about him 
he's very important

38:31.096 --> 39:01.002
I've heard that The Pentagon consumes long hours. 
Is that what you found? Indeed. Matter of fact, on

39:06.985 --> 39:17.139
this job I've just described to you, seldom would I 
get out of the— I'd be there early before anybody

39:06.985 --> 39:17.139
had came in that office in the morning. How early? 
Oh, I'd usually be there by 7 or 7.30. And rarely did

39:21.665 --> 39:26.031
I ever get out of there before 7 at night, sometimes 
later. It might be interesting to mention— that

39:31.627 --> 39:44.543
the executive officer to whom I was assistant was 
then Colonel Harold K. Johnson, who became Chief

39:31.627 --> 39:44.543
of Staff of the Army.

39:44.563 --> 39:53.313
So, I had some very good guidance, and he was doing 
the managing, and I was doing the flunky work in

39:44.563 --> 39:53.313
there and keeping that office going. How was he as a 
leader? Tremendous. Tremendous.

40:03.655 --> 40:07.540
if not the most admired man, one of the most in my 
career. He, an interesting thing,

40:09.742 --> 40:32.430
he had one of the most brilliant minds, one of the 
most human personalities, and one of the most

40:09.742 --> 40:32.430
dedicated commitments to service anyone ever 
knew. and very religious. He was a victim of the

40:38.184 --> 40:43.289
death march at the time. He was a prisoner of the 
Japanese through that whole ordeal, and he was

40:43.309 --> 40:49.974
liberated at the end of the war. He was a very 
corresponding and strong man when he went in, but

40:51.996 --> 41:01.364
he came out stronger in character.

41:01.384 --> 41:03.126
I'm sure he never had an idol moment mentally 
during his captivity because he just maintained

41:03.730 --> 41:33.265
his sharpness and his vision and so well most 
people who went through that ordeal were damaged

41:03.730 --> 41:33.265
to some extent but not him and I've seen others who 
weren't who came out stronger too as a result of

41:03.730 --> 41:33.265
that so anyway he was a he was a fine mentor He

41:33.616 --> 41:39.324
was chief staff during the Vietnam War. Yeah. You 
went from the Pentagon to the Army War College, and

41:40.665 --> 41:58.088
then you went right after that in November 1957 as a 
colonel to the Strategic Intelligence School and

41:40.665 --> 41:58.088
the Language School, in which you stayed for about 
a year and a half until June 1959 before you went to

41:40.665 --> 41:58.088
Yugoslavia. Let's talk about the Intelligence 
School. All right.

42:05.493 --> 42:10.679
At the Army War College, as you're completing your 
year, you get your assignment, your next

42:05.493 --> 42:10.679
assignment. They come up and tell you first before 
they issue the orders. Well, they told me that I had

42:13.281 --> 42:18.707
been selected as military attache to Yugoslavia. 
And I said, I don't want that job. Really? And they

42:21.310 --> 42:22.391
said, well, it's yours. Why? Why didn't you want 
it? Well, in Venezuela, I had observed an attache

42:24.353 --> 42:29.318
at work, and he became a good friend. And he was a 
very pleasant person, and I liked him. I saw

42:32.602 --> 42:33.643
something of him later. But he was military 
attaché to Venezuela, and he was over to our

42:34.720 --> 42:41.950
mission frequently, and I didn't see that he had a 
job to do. As it turns out, that's pretty much true

42:44.494 --> 42:59.956
when you're attaché to an allied country or a very 
friendly country, but it's quite different in a

42:44.494 --> 42:59.956
country that's not that close to us, like 
Yugoslavia being a communist country and so forth

42:44.494 --> 42:59.956
and so on. After all, the primary function of an 
attaché is military intelligence. particularly

43:04.859 --> 43:06.821
strategic intelligence. In other words, the 
things that are going to be important for the long

43:08.303 --> 43:12.768
pull or for the longer range of time. So anyway, I 
just didn't say much about it. Of course, in my

43:18.193 --> 43:31.147
class were people who'd been in personnel and 
intelligence and in attaché duty, and so I went

43:18.193 --> 43:31.147
around asking them, how do I get out of this? Almost 
to a man they said, don't. don't even try. I

43:35.095 --> 43:56.495
thought, really, honestly, and I say I'm naive, 
but I thought that the Army only took volunteers

43:35.095 --> 43:56.495
for military out-of-shade duty because of the 
peculiar aspects

43:35.095 --> 43:56.495
of the—you're attached to an embassy, you see, and 
you're really on diplomatic status, and you're

43:35.095 --> 43:56.495
very heavily committed to a social calendar. 
Sure. Absolutely. And this is the other thing.

43:59.899 --> 44:01.220
That never appealed to me. In fact, that, to me, 
appeared to be a burden and a debilitator. So I

44:09.380 --> 44:26.025
thought, and also in some posts, it used to be, it 
wasn't at this time, it used to be, and this kind of

44:09.380 --> 44:26.025
got into the knowledge of the position, that 
they'd select officers who had additional, you

44:09.380 --> 44:26.025
know, extra income, resources, because they'd 
spend more than they made. Well, that wasn't true

44:26.686 --> 44:32.494
at the time I went on duty because in order to send 
whoever they wanted to, Part of the reason, they

44:32.980 --> 44:39.228
provided the necessary allowances to cover those 
extra expenses. But anyway, they said, don't try

44:39.248 --> 44:41.251
to get out. First of all, you probably can't. 
Secondly, if you try too hard, don't. Or even if you

44:46.377 --> 44:50.162
do succeed, it's going to damage you. It's going to 
damage your record, your assignment probability

44:50.222 --> 44:55.188
for the next assignment. Not that people are going 
to be unfair, but you just declared that you're not

44:56.150 --> 45:01.356
willing to do what you're told to do. You know that 
doesn't fit. So anyway, it took a year and a half to

45:03.743 --> 45:12.633
prepare for that assignment, and that was only a 
two-year assignment. And that seems

45:12.653 --> 45:14.015
extravagant. It sure does. And it is very 
expensive. I bet. And it really, and I recommended

45:17.499 --> 45:25.409
that it be made a three-year assignment to make it 
more cost effective. Now, the reason I didn't

45:25.429 --> 45:32.637
extend is that, strangely enough, when I got on 
post to do my two-year job if I didn't tell them

45:32.870 --> 45:38.416
within a month or so, as I recall, a very short 
period of time. Well, obviously, if it takes a year

45:39.417 --> 45:43.201
and a half to prepare, they've got to know right 
away. I didn't know whether I wanted to extend or

45:43.762 --> 45:45.423
not. And it was a two-year assignment because it 
was not considered a desirable assignment. It

45:50.169 --> 45:55.074
was, you know, rough on the family.

45:55.094 --> 46:00.580
So anyway, that year and a half preparation 
included six months of strategic intelligence

45:55.094 --> 46:00.580
school. In which you studied? In which, uh, We were 
oriented on really what the importance of

46:03.447 --> 46:14.959
strategic intelligence, how it's gathered, how 
it's put together, and what it means to the nation,

46:03.447 --> 46:14.959
to the Army. Where was that school? It was in 
Washington, and that was very valuable. And it

46:19.884 --> 46:28.573
did, of course, have a period of time devoted to 
attache functions and how best to approach those.

46:29.154 --> 46:30.535
You're your own boss, pretty much. you know, 
profiting from the guidelines the Army gives and

46:31.780 --> 46:35.425
the experiences of others. Then I went to the Army 
Language School to study the Yugoslav language,

46:37.228 --> 46:46.282
and that was absolutely essential because 
English is... You just can't get by. You couldn't

46:46.342 --> 46:47.584
then, anyway. You could not get that job done in 
English now. There's just no way to do it. And, of

46:52.892 --> 46:54.254
course, the Army realized that. Well, why do you 
think they picked you for this job? I think the...

46:59.962 --> 47:04.993
The basic reason that I was chosen for that job was 
because of my experience in Venezuela, which was

46:59.962 --> 47:04.993
not without a reason.
