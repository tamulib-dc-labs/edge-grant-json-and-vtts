WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:18.205
This is a bright, sunny morning, March 30, and I 
have the joy and honor of being in the breakfast

00:02.680 --> 00:18.205
area just north of Moody with Dr. N.A. McNeil. I'm 
going to chat with him about his memories as a

00:18.826 --> 00:27.540
student and then as one of the dedicated members of 
the A&M staff. Dr. McNeil, try your, say a sentence

00:28.077 --> 00:32.323
or two and let's see your mics working. Now then, I 
was born in Moody. Okay, wait a minute. That's

00:36.910 --> 00:38.111
enough.

00:42.758 --> 00:50.289
Dr. McNeil, give us an autobiography of your days 
before you got to A&M. Where did you grow up and your

00:50.349 --> 00:56.518
family and what all did you learn growing up and 
that sort of thing? Well, My daddy was a dedicated

00:59.549 --> 01:13.441
Republican because he was related very distantly 
to General Sam Houston. And when Harding was

01:15.823 --> 01:23.070
elected, daddy expected to get the post office 
immediately. But it didn't happen that way. He

01:27.634 --> 01:29.235
rented our farm. to a distant cousin of his, and we 
moved into Moody after spending seven months as a

01:30.413 --> 01:43.509
farm overseer for a large landowner. After we 
moved to Moody, we still were not able to get into

01:44.871 --> 01:56.886
the post office until the last month of 19 and 22. At 
that time, as a 10, 12 year old boy, eight year old

02:00.704 --> 02:12.018
boy, I started working in the post office. And 
daddy would sort the mail into six stacks. And we

02:17.025 --> 02:20.429
had two stacks for local customers. And I put up the 
mail on the front part of the office while the

02:21.290 --> 02:30.542
carriers came in and took care of their various 
duties with the four stacks that he had prepared

02:31.754 --> 02:37.160
for them. After I got through with working in the 
post office with Daddy, I went to school. And for

02:47.171 --> 02:57.123
six months, they had to pay tuition for me because I 
was not quite old enough to go to school that year.

02:58.404 --> 03:00.867
But after we Got into the, after the election and 
while we were waiting for his appointment, I went

03:02.247 --> 03:15.067
to school at a rural school west of Moody at Haunted 
Hill. We had one teacher. And I suppose I started my

03:18.672 --> 03:22.418
teaching career there. Because when I went to 
Moody to school, I learned to read in the first

03:23.439 --> 03:29.689
grade. And when I got to Haunted Hill, the boys that 
was in the first grade with me had not been in school

03:30.665 --> 03:47.222
but maybe six weeks because they didn't start 
school till cotton picking was over. And the

03:48.383 --> 03:53.648
teacher who said to me, look, you've already read 
all of these books. You go over and listen to this

03:53.688 --> 03:59.254
other first grade teacher. first grade student as 
he learns to read.

04:07.248 --> 04:19.719
After I got back into the Moody School, I was 
interested at age 10 in 4-H club work. And it was

04:21.380 --> 04:29.207
several years after we got into 4-H club work 
before we got a vocational agriculture teacher at

04:21.380 --> 04:29.207
Moody. But I took part in that activity.

04:35.288 --> 04:52.692
Sometime in the early fall of 1930,

04:35.288 --> 04:52.692
one of my cousins came to me and said, look, you've 
just been in high school three years, but you've

04:35.288 --> 04:52.692
got as many credits in high school as I have. Let's 
go to A&M together next year. We'd been in 4-H

04:56.878 --> 04:58.620
together. So I said, well, all right. And we went 
down to A&M in April to the judging contest. We were

05:07.513 --> 05:15.545
dairy cattle judges, and we didn't place in the 
contest down there. But I went to the poultry farm

05:16.467 --> 05:22.817
and made application for a job. And soon after I got 
home, I was told that I could work on the poultry

05:23.878 --> 05:28.405
farm. In the meantime, I went down there and went to 
work on the poultry farm, but this cousin of mine

05:29.937 --> 05:44.632
could not finance in any way his going to A&M. He 
didn't have a job, and so he worked for Daddy in the

05:45.173 --> 05:56.164
post office for one year to get funds to go to A&M 
with me the next year. And Elsie and I went to A&M as

05:57.528 --> 06:08.021
part of the first project house that was ever 
organized at Texas A&M. Now, this was the fall of?

06:09.342 --> 06:10.764
31. No, fall of 32.

06:16.591 --> 06:22.058
In the meantime, there's other boys from Moody who 
wanted to go to A&M. And I came home and suggested

06:23.600 --> 06:26.303
that if we wanted to go to A&M that we organize a 
group and go down to A&M and get permission to have a

06:27.295 --> 06:40.930
group from Moody who lived off of the campus. And we 
went to see the Deans. And Dean Kyle was

06:46.056 --> 06:54.726
immediately in favor of the project for the boys to 
bring food from home and rent a house and live

06:46.056 --> 06:54.726
together. And Dean Winkler, who at that time was 
dean of the College of Education, knew my father

06:57.569 --> 07:09.582
through the association of being postmaster at 
Moody and his family there. So he said, look, this

07:10.363 --> 07:12.946
is great, we'll do it. When we went to see the other 
two deans, Dean Friley, and I don't instantly

07:14.208 --> 07:27.222
recall, I don't know the name of the other deans, We 
went to see Dean Francis. Of course, he was

07:32.097 --> 07:35.642
completely deaf at that time. And Dean Francis 
threw up his hands and says, whatever the rest of

07:36.523 --> 07:43.995
them decide, I'll go along with them. Thank you for 
coming. Two or three days later, we got a letter

07:46.699 --> 07:57.715
from Texas A&M addressed to my daddy saying that 
under two conditions, that you can do what you have

07:58.336 --> 08:01.781
asked to do. You must have someone to cook for you. 
You can't do that and come down here and batch. And

08:10.193 --> 08:16.922
the second condition was that you must have an A&M 
sponsor. We have that requirement for everybody.

08:21.549 --> 08:25.795
So Dan Russell, who made the talk, at moody the year 
that year before we approached the idea was asked

08:26.315 --> 08:49.048
to be the sponsor for the group and he was very 
graciously accepted the responsibility and did a

08:26.315 --> 08:49.048
great deal of work to get the house organized he 
found the cheap old house out near the Hort Farm

08:49.889 --> 08:56.255
that had been abandoned for 15 or 20 years. Horse 
farm? Hort. Horticulture farm. Oh, horticulture

08:59.979 --> 09:02.882
farm. He was called the Suber House. And it was 
ideally

09:05.425 --> 09:15.415
fitted to be a project house. There were four 
bedrooms upstairs. two bread rooms downstairs.

09:21.190 --> 09:25.894
They had a parlor, a kitchen, and a dining room. But 
they didn't have any water. And of course, they

09:30.218 --> 09:34.061
didn't have any bath facilities. So the parents of 
the boys, after we went down there, went down to A&M

09:35.022 --> 09:47.993
and replaced broken window lights, broken 
whatever they needed. And a well was dug by the

09:50.714 --> 09:55.980
landlord. And it was cased with pine casing. And 
you can imagine what that water tasted like when we

10:01.225 --> 10:10.675
had to make our meals with pine tasting water. But 
we piped the water into the bathroom and into the

10:11.816 --> 10:18.283
kitchen. And we lived in this house for 18 months. 
The first house was very, the first year was very

10:23.967 --> 10:29.373
successful. Who was the cook? Lena McMahon, 
M-C-M-A-H-A-N. McMahon sometimes it's called.

10:38.062 --> 10:39.184
Where did you all locate her? Well, she was a cousin 
of both A.A. McNeil and Ethel Aiken. mothers that

10:47.272 --> 10:53.420
went to A&M at the time that it was approved were on 
the steering committee that went to A&M. And she

10:54.902 --> 10:57.065
was a lovely person. And her husband came with her. 
He was unemployed at the time. And the first year,

11:04.836 --> 11:16.131
in August, when most of the students had gone home, 
Mr. McMahon was killed. on the road down to the

11:16.837 --> 11:20.261
horticulture farm. He was changing a tire on a 
truck and was killed. And after his death, then

11:25.387 --> 11:31.254
Cousin Lena wouldn't stay with us. We had to get 
someone else. And the next cook and caretaker was

11:34.958 --> 11:44.329
unhappy at A&M and said on the first of, january 
we're going back home to moody so that was the end

11:45.237 --> 12:14.535
off and by that time other project houses had been 
established and when those other houses were

11:45.237 --> 12:14.535
established most of the group went into the lufkin 
house and some of them went to the dormitory some of

11:45.237 --> 12:14.535
them went to independent but they scattered and 
the majority went to the lufkin house Do you

12:14.920 --> 12:20.446
remember what you and others brought from home in 
the way of food? We brought cured meat. We brought

12:23.810 --> 12:27.954
canned goods, home canned goods. And mostly it was 
canned, there was some canned meat that farmers

12:28.635 --> 12:36.344
had, the brothers had canned meat. But it was, we 
also purchased our necessary items from a local

12:44.080 --> 12:47.104
chain store. And Dan Russell was instrumental in 
locating this red and white store that gave us a

12:48.005 --> 12:55.274
nice discount. And we bought all of the necessary 
things other than that which we brought from home.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.344
One boy brought a cow. Every boy brought four hens. 
We had a chicken pen for all the eggs we needed. And

13:11.738 --> 13:17.286
we had all the milk that we needed from the cow that 
we brought from Moody.

13:20.971 --> 13:32.227
At the

13:20.971 --> 13:32.227
end of June, that was the second, third year, my 
third year in college.

13:35.312 --> 13:37.054
I had to go to summer camp.

13:40.156 --> 13:41.638
Cut it off just a minute. Complete. It's on now. 
Okay. After I had finished my junior year at A&M, I

13:47.306 --> 14:03.428
was able

13:47.306 --> 14:03.428
to get a contract. And with a contract, In military 
science, I got $31 a month. And after I got the $31 a

14:11.818 --> 14:17.647
month, I had to go to San Antonio for junior. 
Between my junior and senior year, I went to ROTC

14:18.288 --> 14:22.795
camp in San Antonio. I went to Camp Bullies. And we 
had to work from very early in the morning until

14:27.142 --> 14:33.332
noon, and then they dismissed us. And most of the 
A&M boys headed for San Antonio. And there were

14:37.409 --> 14:47.141
only three or four of us that were there in the 
afternoon because we didn't have any contacts and

14:37.409 --> 14:47.141
we didn't have any money and we stayed there. But in 
the meantime, I lost my contract if I did not take

14:48.523 --> 14:54.371
English. So I went to Tarleton to get the only 
school that I could find that offered English that

14:54.912 --> 15:03.403
I needed. And I enrolled in Tarleton, and the 
teacher in English was Pearl Mahan. And she saw

15:13.637 --> 15:22.450
three new students in her class, and she said, Ms. 
So-and-so, where did you take your English? And

15:23.611 --> 15:26.656
the student said, I took it at North Texas State. 
And Ms. Mahan said, what did you make? She said, I

15:30.301 --> 15:32.344
made an A. She said, if you work real hard, you can 
make a B here. And then she asked the second

15:38.563 --> 15:44.449
student, where did you take your prior English? 
And she said, I took it somewhere else. I don't

15:47.472 --> 15:48.273
remember. And then she said, Mr. McNeil, where did 
you take your prior English? And I said, Texas A&M.

16:00.117 --> 16:09.570
She said, Mr. McNeil, didn't you know that this was 
the hardest, that my English course was the

16:00.117 --> 16:09.570
hardest in the state? And I said, Ms. Mahan, I 
didn't know it till I got here. But anyway, she had a

16:16.620 --> 16:20.045
peculiar system of grading. I never understood 
it. I never questioned it. And I made a C, which

16:23.129 --> 16:26.033
would transfer to A&M. And another rather 
peculiar incident happened out there. Old Pop

16:30.205 --> 16:42.117
Hale had been teaching for years, and Pop Hale 
taught an education course, and so I enrolled in an

16:30.205 --> 16:42.117
education course. And the first day of class, he 
asked a question.

16:48.143 --> 16:55.150
It took me maybe decades of years to remember what 
question he asked. But the question he had to do

16:56.294 --> 17:06.229
with the peculiar kind of monkey that was found on 
the island of Madagascar. And when I answered that

17:06.249 --> 17:15.944
correctly, because I'd been reading the National 
Geographic, he called me Madagascar for the rest

17:06.249 --> 17:15.944
of the term. And at the end of that class, he called 
me in and said, I want you to grade my papers. And so

17:22.774 --> 17:24.597
in that Six weeks I was there, I graded Pop Hale's

17:25.420 --> 17:33.250
homework for him. I'd wait till the class was gone, 
get it, and then have it graded and ready for him to

17:33.371 --> 17:39.939
pass out the next day. Now this is at Tarleton? At 
Tarleton. Did you by chance ever hear any

17:42.843 --> 17:47.830
discussion of a former student of theirs named 
Earl Rudder? Not at all. The first time I heard the

17:50.633 --> 17:54.178
name Earl Rudder, had to do with wartime 
experiences. I had my wartime experiences in a

17:59.401 --> 18:05.947
different area than Earl Rudder had his. We'll get 
to those in a minute. At A&M, as far as you can

18:07.889 --> 18:16.476
remember, what did it cost for you to go to A&M? What 
was the tuition and fees when you were a freshman?

18:20.580 --> 18:21.120
Do you remember? $50. $50. For all? That was for a 
semester. Right. And where did you acquire that

18:27.927 --> 18:29.489
$50? Well, when my folks

18:30.690 --> 18:44.386
had to move away from the farm, I had a small dairy 
herd. And when we left the farm, I had to dispose of

18:45.768 --> 18:51.815
the dairy cattle. And I sent a load of cattle to Fort 
Worth. Eight head. And when I got the check, after I

18:59.676 --> 19:09.429
had paid the travel expenses and so forth in Fort 
Worth, I had $85. And I accumulated money from

19:09.449 --> 19:18.461
other ways until I had enough money to meet my 
expenses.

19:22.507 --> 19:23.548
I had money saved. that I used from various 
activities. Now to take the tape off, I want to tell

19:28.501 --> 19:32.968
you something else.

19:35.392 --> 19:37.275
Back to the project house. Describe the routine of 
duties that you and the other young men had in that

19:37.295 --> 19:44.586
project house. Who did what? Each pair of boys in 
one room had to keep their room clean. they had no

19:52.807 --> 20:16.097
other responsibility mrs mcmahan prepared the 
food they put it on the table and she did or her

19:52.807 --> 20:16.097
husband did the washing of the dishes in other 
project houses students were sometimes required

19:52.807 --> 20:16.097
to do part of the dishwashers and so forth, but not 
in any that I ever lived in. Did you all have any

20:21.123 --> 20:24.768
responsibilities for mowing the grass? Well, yes 
we did. One

20:28.253 --> 20:36.424
incident that we had, we had no sewer system. We 
built a privy with a deep hole out there and one

20:37.105 --> 20:45.477
morning when it got real cold, we looked out and 
there was smoke coming out of the privy. And sure

20:53.322 --> 21:03.995
enough, Mrs. McMahon's husband was out there with 
a bucket of cold to keep himself morning while he

20:53.322 --> 21:03.995
did his morning's morning. And one time, the rest 
of the boys got so annoyed with a couple of the boys

21:05.577 --> 21:12.966
that they were not keeping their room like it ought 
to be and so they each got little sticks and they

21:13.030 --> 21:40.810
went in that room and completely dismantled 
everything going around with their sticks saying

21:13.030 --> 21:40.810
i'm killing rats we're killing rats in this room 
and they didn't have any trouble with those fellas

21:13.030 --> 21:40.810
not keeping their room clean after that how did you 
all do your laundry uh we bundled all of our laundry

21:41.077 --> 22:10.847
up and took it down the road to a black woman who did 
the group the group laundry for everybody and it

21:41.077 --> 22:10.847
cost us maybe uh 50 cents a week to no more than 75 
cents a week to get everybody's laundry done and

21:41.077 --> 22:10.847
they it was a very satisfactory laundry situation 
In terms of food, it canned goods and cured meat,

22:11.384 --> 22:19.513
which would have been primarily pork? Yes, pork. 
Sometimes there was some canned meat from a beef

22:21.675 --> 22:27.742
animal. In some families, they'd kill a beef on the 
farm, and they didn't have the frozen food

22:28.603 --> 22:41.357
facilities then, so they'd can the meat that they 
couldn't cure. What about dessert? I really

22:46.341 --> 22:51.066
learned to do without dessert when we were in the 
project house. Did anybody bring any syrup,

22:51.326 --> 22:56.231
molasses, ribbon cane syrup from home? Not from 
this area. And do you remember how much this lady

22:59.335 --> 23:08.104
was paid as the

22:59.335 --> 23:08.104
hostess $1 per day. $1 per day. Well, $1 per month. 
Per boy? Per boy. And there were how many? There

23:17.659 --> 23:20.963
were 10 the first year and 12 the second. So you 
lived there two years. And in relation to the

23:23.966 --> 23:30.413
campus today, where was that house? The first 
house was right across the street from the

23:30.894 --> 23:35.859
horticulture farm. All right, but now. On the F&B 
Road. The Wellborn Road? No, it was the road that

23:44.350 --> 23:47.917
was going towards Snook? No, it was the road that 
went out by the dairy farm. and the horticulture

23:54.743 --> 23:58.767
farm, and it was called F&B Road. It was about a mile 
to the railroad crossing and another mile from the

23:59.668 --> 24:05.113
railroad crossing to the house. How did you and 
your buddies get from the house to the campus for

24:05.373 --> 24:09.357
class? Part of the time, we'd ride the truck that 
Mr. Mahan had. It was a big old gravel truck, and

24:18.266 --> 24:22.590
we'd ride in the back of that. Most of the time we'd 
walk up the railroad track and highway. Very

24:28.139 --> 24:32.364
seldom did we have to walk all of the way to A&M. At 
night, well, describe a typical weekday. What

24:38.311 --> 24:39.893
time did y'all get up? When did you go to class? 
What'd you do for fun? Well, we generally had

24:43.918 --> 24:49.725
breakfast at six o'clock in the morning. And then 
that gave us two hours to get to an 8 o'clock class if

24:50.431 --> 24:56.656
we had to walk all the way, but we didn't. We seldom 
walked all the way. And at noon, we were able to get

25:00.139 --> 25:08.066
back for a noon meal and our evening meal. We did not 
eat any meals away from there.

25:14.892 --> 25:20.337
We had football games and various other 
activities. that is confined to the 10 or 12 of us

25:20.806 --> 25:25.231
that were there. Now you were in the Corps. I was in 
the Corps and hated every day of it. All right, did

25:33.461 --> 25:36.424
you have to be over there to fall in for? The only 
time I went to the Corps was on drill day. They lined

25:44.133 --> 25:48.298
the day dodgers up on the second floor. And they 
beat the hell out of us. My tail end was as black as

25:53.421 --> 25:56.705
your hat. What did they use for paddles? It looked 
like shaved down baseball bats. It'd be as big

26:03.072 --> 26:08.678
around as a baseball bat, but it had flat ends. And 
what outfit were you in? I was in F company

26:11.621 --> 26:13.643
infantry. Did it have a nickname? Not that I know 
of, but it was made up of some of the better students

26:15.835 --> 26:24.028
at A&M that year. I remember that one of the Astons 
was in that organization. One of the Astons, from

26:31.019 --> 26:33.342
Brian? No. Who was that Aston? Oh, Jimmy Aston from 
Dallas. That's right. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:41.495 --> 26:42.256
Farmersville. Right. And... Watson, the editor 
of the battalion, was in that unit.

26:51.230 --> 26:59.221
There were five of us that were seniors in F 
Company. And, of course, I was a second lieutenant

27:00.583 --> 27:06.791
because I hadn't been around all of the time. As far 
as I know, I'm the only living person that was in my

27:13.480 --> 27:17.004
senior class when I graduated.

27:19.386 --> 27:23.770
The third year, see I stayed in project houses for 
three years. Two years, because I'd stayed at the

27:25.953 --> 27:31.038
poultry farm one year and then project house two 
years. And then in the Corps, I waited on tables at

27:31.058 --> 27:37.745
the mess hall. And I was the only senior that waited 
on tables at A&M. Most of the supervisors were

27:44.092 --> 27:49.508
juniors and been there for some time. She'll get 
the phone.

27:55.966 --> 27:56.548
Honey?

28:11.345 --> 28:14.030
Now, you waited tables then in Sabisa? Right.

28:21.924 --> 28:28.917
My mama

28:21.924 --> 28:28.917
bought Lou Casey boots for me. Cost $35. And the 
seniors in my company decided I had not earned

28:33.198 --> 28:39.464
boots. And they were in my closet. And then they 
weren't. And I had to go buy a pair of $4 or $5 lace-up

28:46.852 --> 28:53.619
boots my senior year.

28:56.361 --> 28:59.865
And that's just... Did the Lucchese boots ever 
reappear? No. Oh, so somebody stole them. That's

29:02.367 --> 29:02.968
right. Somebody stole them, but they meant for me 
not to have senior boots as a day dodger. Now, were

29:11.761 --> 29:18.729
all project house students considered day 
dodgers? Until A&M built the 12 project houses,

29:18.749 --> 29:24.575
they were. When were those built? Was it after you 
were? It was about 1937. So after you were gone as a

29:30.782 --> 29:33.225
student. About how many project houses were there 
before A&M built some? At least 40. Did you all call

29:42.932 --> 29:45.777
them project houses then? Yes, sir. Did you all 
refer to your first one as the Moody Project House?

29:54.310 --> 30:01.160
We talked about it, but we also said Dr. Russell, 
D.R. Russell, said, had helped us, we put up a big

30:03.614 --> 30:07.159
sign, Russell Hall. Describe him and personality 
and type and everything. Well, Dr. Russell was a

30:15.130 --> 30:22.280
very compassionate man. And he did

30:22.320 --> 30:32.153
just a fantastic work with all of the project 
houses. but it was the Moody group that drew him

30:33.044 --> 30:38.252
into this. And the year that I was married in 1939, 
the radio

30:39.955 --> 31:00.148
program that was called the Inside Story

30:39.955 --> 31:00.148
called him when much publicity had been given to a 
Reader's Digest article saying that 2,000

31:00.668 --> 31:19.472
people, 2,000 students were going to school on the 
co-op plan which originated at Texas A&M with

31:00.668 --> 31:19.472
Daniel Russell. And he told them that he did not 
originate the plan, that I was a vocational

31:19.492 --> 31:28.363
agriculture teacher at Alvin, And he recommended 
they get in touch with me. And I got permission from

31:33.396 --> 31:37.780
the school board to go to Chicago. And I was told 
that I would stay at the Palmer House. And I thought

31:43.845 --> 31:48.189
that that was some little old side place.

31:52.793 --> 31:57.557
And when I found out it was the biggest hotel in 
Chicago, I went during the American Legion

31:58.212 --> 32:12.174
Convention, and they were dropping water in bags 
on people, and you couldn't get within four blocks

31:58.212 --> 32:12.174
of the hotel, and I had to dodge water bags to get to 
it. When I came home, I told them that we couldn't

32:13.557 --> 32:20.608
get in World War II, and that was in 1939. because we 
couldn't stand another crop of legionnaires.

32:28.558 --> 32:32.061
Let's see, back to that first year. Describe how 
you enrolled, signed up for your first classes

32:32.802 --> 32:39.968
that freshman year. What did you take that 
freshman year and why? Well, I took a regular

32:43.391 --> 32:51.017
course

32:43.391 --> 32:51.017
and I lived at the poultry farm. And after the 
spring term, I won a dairy cattle judging for

32:52.364 --> 33:01.658
freshmen. And I had been getting up before 
breakfast every morning and scraping the

33:03.541 --> 33:14.077
dropping boards from the houses and then going to 
breakfast and coming home and going to school. And

33:15.058 --> 33:19.485
I worked on the poultry farm to make my payment. I 
decided that after I won the dairy judging contest

33:21.355 --> 33:26.763
that I'd take dairy husbandry. And that forced me 
to move from the poultry farm to some other

33:27.384 --> 33:32.732
arrangement. And of course the project house 
really was patterned on the house where the

33:33.993 --> 33:46.772
students ate with the group of people eating at the 
hort farm. And I think that the fact that it was

33:48.220 --> 33:57.308
patterned on that made Dean Kyle enthusiastic 
about it. All right, as that freshman year, so you

33:58.229 --> 34:04.374
took math and English and whatever. Do you 
remember some of those early teachers that were

34:05.635 --> 34:10.260
important to you later in your life?

34:13.983 --> 34:16.405
Well, sort of. but not my freshman year. I had an 
English teacher by the name of Keyes, if I remember

34:19.407 --> 34:25.292
correctly. Keyes, K-E-Y? K-E-Y-S. He had been an 
instructor at Thorpe Springs Christian College.

34:34.801 --> 34:43.710
And the most person who influenced me most at A&M 
was A.D. Martin, a math instructor. And he was, he

34:46.760 --> 34:49.583
was a member of the Church of Christ. And there was 
no building. And he came every Sunday morning and

34:52.786 --> 35:03.817
brought the Lord's Supper for a devotional in the 
YMCA. And on Sunday morning, I knew that I'd have a

35:05.158 --> 35:12.565
letter in the post office if I went to church. My 
mama had a letter. in the post office every Sunday

35:14.890 --> 35:17.135
morning. And I got acquainted with A.D. Martin. 
About how many attended that Church of Christ

35:20.662 --> 35:23.427
service? Well, probably 15 or 20. Were there other 
church groups meeting in the YMCA at various

35:30.441 --> 35:35.572
times? As far as I know, not. The Baptist Church had 
buildings just off of the campus. And the first

35:44.467 --> 35:57.542
year that Brother Martin was there, he went down to 
Houston to explain the church work that he did with

35:44.467 --> 35:57.542
students at A&M. And a woman by the name of Woodward 
told him that she wanted to build a church at A&M.

36:07.118 --> 36:09.462
and for him to get plans for a church. And when he got 
the plans and took it to her, it was a plan for a

36:10.763 --> 36:18.235
wooden building. And she said, that doesn't suit 
me. I want a brick building. And she was the wife of a

36:23.823 --> 36:26.667
wealthy oil man. And she says, I'll give you 
$10,000 a year for the next so and so. And so That

36:35.755 --> 36:38.620
building was built when I was a senior. So that was 
the first? That was the first building for the

36:40.763 --> 36:44.710
Church of Christ in College Station. That's 
right. And finished your senior year? I was down

36:48.916 --> 36:53.604
there quite often looking at the building. I 
watched them put every brick in it almost, but I was

36:53.704 --> 36:57.891
concerned. And I really, I don't know how to go 
about this, But Brother Martin gave me the cards

37:03.633 --> 37:13.269
for all of the people who said that they were 
members of the Church of Christ. And I carried

37:13.289 --> 37:17.516
those cards and made those contacts of all of them. 
And I knew by the time I was a senior, I knew nearly

37:18.257 --> 37:25.449
every one of the members of the Church of Christ. 
Were there many members off campus or were almost

37:25.469 --> 37:29.455
all of them students? There was only one person 
that ever came to that before church building. One

37:37.966 --> 37:43.151
of the employees, the USDA, would occasionally 
come to that service. And the others were

37:43.331 --> 37:47.235
students.

37:48.235 --> 37:52.359
And he brought the message each Sunday. That's 
right. And then he'd go back to Bryan and go to

37:55.142 --> 37:58.345
church in Bryan. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Did you by chance 
meet Mr. Cashin, who was the YMCA director? Oh,

38:03.401 --> 38:03.821
yes. Describe him, please. Well, he was just a fine 
individual, and he was compassionate, and he

38:05.323 --> 38:16.434
would do anything that he could for a student. I 
knew all of the people that worked at the YMCA for a

38:17.675 --> 38:28.686
period of time, but I don't really have any comment 
to make about him. I knew him quite well. Did you, in

38:35.257 --> 38:43.486
those days when you were living in the project 
houses, did you go into the A&M dormitories very

38:35.257 --> 38:43.486
often? Only when they took me in there when I was a 
freshman. I see. I did not go into, when I had drill,

38:51.415 --> 38:56.361
I didn't go into the dormitories. The only time I 
went into dormitories was to visit with members of

38:57.067 --> 39:01.854
the church. What about some friendships that you 
made during those early years that lasted

39:03.677 --> 39:08.544
forever? Who were some special fellow Aggies, 
special to you? Well, now then, the people that was

39:13.711 --> 39:25.048
in that first project cast evidently were made up 
of different background, and we've maintained

39:26.395 --> 39:30.583
contact. And in 1992,

39:31.625 --> 39:48.859
we had been out from A&M over these long periods of 
years, and we had a reunion here at Moody. And nine

39:49.497 --> 40:00.913
of the 18 who went to A&M in 1932, in the fall of 1932, 
met here at Moody for a reunion. About how many of

40:01.774 --> 40:04.919
the original group graduated?

40:07.462 --> 40:07.963
Half of them? Two-thirds? Oh, nearly all of them. I 
don't remember but one or two that didn't make it.

40:16.514 --> 40:22.721
We had one student from Moody that went down there 
and stayed a half a year nearly, and he couldn't

40:16.514 --> 40:22.721
make it. But I don't remember anybody else 
dropping out, and I don't remember anybody else

40:22.862 --> 40:29.429
that didn't graduate. When you went to and from 
Moody to College Station, how did you get there?

40:36.278 --> 40:38.100
Highway did. Road with them. Describe some 
memories you have of hitchhiking to and from A&M.

40:47.345 --> 41:02.144
Well, I can remember waiting on a corner in Marlin 
for 14 hours before a cotton truck came along

40:47.345 --> 41:02.144
loaded with cotton, and the driver told me I could 
sit on top of that cotton if I wanted to, and I did. In

41:02.244 --> 41:15.681
the four years that I went to A&M, I went back to A&M 
on rail no more than twice when the weather was,

41:17.045 --> 41:24.076
almost too bad to get if it wouldn't be anybody on 
the highway. Where could you catch that train? In

41:26.399 --> 41:26.940
Maryland? No, I caught the train in Moody and went 
to Milano, caught a change of trains there and went

41:27.401 --> 41:37.536
to Valley Junction and changed trains there and 
got to College Station. And I had two stops there.

41:42.256 --> 41:43.658
changes in between. Do you remember how much that 
cost? No, I don't have an idea. Did you ever have any

41:48.787 --> 41:51.412
bad experiences hitchhiking?

41:57.703 --> 42:03.994
I wouldn't call it bad experience, but I got in a car 
one time that was loaded with rifles. all kinds of

42:04.987 --> 42:06.849
artillery. And the people in it identified 
themselves to me as Texas Rangers, and they were on

42:08.030 --> 42:22.683
the route

42:08.030 --> 42:22.683
looking for Bonnie and Clyde. And I didn't, I got a 
ride and I was glad to do it, but the Texas Rangers

42:24.805 --> 42:34.133
picked me up one time, I remember. Which way were 
they headed? They were headed towards College

42:36.627 --> 42:38.409
Station. They'd let me out at College Station. Did 
you ever have any fun experience hitchhiking?

42:48.479 --> 42:49.000
Interesting? Goofy? Well, at the end of my 
freshman year, I hitchhiked all over Central

42:52.003 --> 43:01.032
Texas, from Moody to Goldthwait to Hamilton to 
back to moody and this spare country between the

43:01.265 --> 43:15.763
half of gold weight and hamilton i'll tell you that 
but i made it i had relatives living in mills county

43:01.265 --> 43:15.763
in comanche county And when you hitchhiked, you 
always wore your uniform. Yes, sir. Did not put up a

43:21.959 --> 43:24.261
sign or anything like that. Just rode your thumb. 
That's right.

43:29.506 --> 43:37.654
When you were going to class, how did you and your 
classmates, how did you all behave in A&M classes?

43:38.195 --> 43:41.398
There wasn't any question we behaved. And I want 
you to know that when I was an instructor at A&M, I

43:46.608 --> 43:54.442
never had a student that was any problem in 
conduct.

43:56.806 --> 43:58.709
My class was streaked one time. I'm not gonna put 
this on the tape, but I'll give you my memoir that

43:58.809 --> 44:08.065
describes the incident. If you and your buddies 
had some free time, uh... where you didn't have to

44:11.903 --> 44:40.611
work or didn't have to study what did y'all do for 
fun for to relax

44:11.903 --> 44:40.611
i suspect we we there were two or three of us that 
that on sunday afternoon would go down into the

44:11.903 --> 44:40.611
woods and look for pecan trees and we found hickory 
nut trees down there most of us Spent our

44:41.249 --> 44:48.398
afternoons, well, visiting and so forth. I don't 
remember it. Other than football, I don't

44:49.999 --> 44:53.744
remember that we played anything. Any other game, 
we played football quite a lot when the weather was

44:54.325 --> 44:57.769
good. Did y'all go to the movie much? Not very 
often. After walking to school and back, Every day

45:05.954 --> 45:09.578
we didn't want to walk over there at night. Did you, 
in Aggie lingo, did you all sack out in the

45:09.598 --> 45:14.043
afternoon? Not really. We either were going to 
school or working. All right. So you got up, ate

45:22.052 --> 45:27.118
breakfast, went to class, came back to eat lunch. 
Right. And then went back to the campus. Right. So

45:30.441 --> 45:33.885
you went to and from the campus every, at least 
twice a day. Right. And we didn't walk over to the

45:37.394 --> 45:43.502
campus very often at night, I'll tell you that. Did 
you study in your room? Yes, sir. Who had a radio in

45:48.229 --> 45:49.771
those days? Nobody. And by the way, we studied by 
Aladdin lamps. There was no electricity. What

45:58.203 --> 45:59.805
kind of stove did she have? That's an interesting 
story. We Russell found some old stoves that had

46:04.966 --> 46:12.254
been used years before and stored somewhere. And 
each room had a chimney in it. And we had wood stoves

46:17.499 --> 46:20.602
in each room. And

46:22.384 --> 46:33.876
sometime in the changeover from wood to coal down 
at the electric plant, they had covered up a lot of

46:36.269 --> 46:43.275
wood that had been there for years. And so we mined 
that wood from the covered up place at the back of

46:44.136 --> 46:54.825
the power plant. Did she cook on a wood stove, 
though? Yes, she did. Oh, really? Yes, sir. Oh, my.

47:00.951 --> 47:02.632
All right. Did life change for you as a sophomore? 
Was it different?
