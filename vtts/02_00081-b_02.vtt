And recognition is very important. I think the 
university should do more of it. For example, I did

00:07.793 --> 00:10.880
get the teaching award from the college. But I got 
it at much, what the year was, 19. I had a bunch of

00:17.345 --> 00:20.752
crap. I was a better teacher in 1970 than I was in 
1990. I don't know why they gave it to me. Maybe they

00:27.144 --> 00:31.533
gave it to me in 1990 because I was afraid I was going 
to have a heart attack or something. Things were

00:31.593 --> 00:34.138
given for the wrong reason. And they really should 
be recognizing the young people early in the game.

00:39.247 --> 00:42.112
They should recognize, first of all, whether the 
person's any good in the first place. And there

00:42.453 --> 00:44.577
should be more recognition made. And it's nickel 
and dime stuff. It's not like you have to give them

00:48.183 --> 00:51.049
thousands and thousands of dollars. I mean, a 
little plaque would do it if it says, hey, we think

00:51.209 --> 00:56.298
you're great. You've made a great contribution. 
We thank you for this and thank you for that. I think

01:00.645 --> 01:06.513
that's the one thing that A&M could have done more 
of. Let's see. This is a question I hadn't thought

01:09.617 --> 01:11.519
of. Do you have any Aggie stories? You know, 
incredible, could have only happened at A&M? No, I

01:21.913 --> 01:23.095
don't think so. No, I don't think so. All right, 
let's quit then. Thank you.
