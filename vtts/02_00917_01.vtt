00:01.330 --> 00:07.899
We're in the office of Bruce McClendon in the 
municipal building of Fort Worth. Bruce, after

00:09.140 --> 00:20.615
you left Galveston, you went to Beaumont, and tell 
us a little bit about the program in Beaumont and

00:09.140 --> 00:20.615
what your role in that was. Well, Beaumont was just 
as much of a challenge as Galveston in that It was

00:27.757 --> 00:29.400
the right time. Something needed to be done and 
people wanted it done. The manager who hired me,

00:33.186 --> 00:37.953
Ray Riley, was outstanding. He and his classmates 
from that particular class of KU all turned out to

00:38.173 --> 00:45.104
be very successful. It's Anderson in Dallas, Lou 
Fox in San Antonio, Muhlenbeck, who was down in

00:47.990 --> 00:51.899
Galveston, and Ray Riley. And I thought Ray Riley 
was the one who was more skilled, more gifted as a

00:52.540 --> 00:58.254
manager than any of the others. He is now working in 
the private sector and the head of a major

00:58.274 --> 01:04.969
corporation down here in the Beaumont area, a very 
successful individual. But Ray had a little bit of

01:05.523 --> 01:08.792
a planning background. He had interned up in the 
Kansas City, Lawrence area in a planning kind of

01:08.872 --> 01:15.670
capacity. So he knew the terminology, he knew the 
techniques, he knew the deficiencies that

01:16.252 --> 01:22.047
existed, and he gave me broad marching orders to 
basically create a planning program to do

01:22.027 --> 01:28.775
something with respect to planning. Everything 
they had was 20 or 30 years old. They had old

01:32.220 --> 01:38.808
comprehensive plans, old zoning, old 
subdivision regulations, no capital

01:32.220 --> 01:38.808
improvements programming. A planner's dream. I 
mean, here you're given the resources and the

01:39.829 --> 01:42.913
direction to do something. Who had been the 
planning director previously? Somebody from

01:46.217 --> 01:48.760
Chicago had been brought in for a couple of years. 
Anderson, I believe, was his name, John Anderson.

01:53.685 --> 01:57.969
And John was a regional, had come from a regional 
planning commission. And there was a big jump from

01:58.749 --> 02:01.992
regional planning to municipal planning. I don't 
think John and I have been able to make that jump.

02:04.535 --> 02:07.317
And he had a young staff out of the way, part of the 
state. So he really didn't have

02:07.398 --> 02:17.447
the staff in place or the experience, in my 
judgment, to be as effective as he put it in. And he

02:18.187 --> 02:20.788
tended to sit on his staff a little bit. I was a 
little bit afraid of them for the younger ones that

02:21.140 --> 02:27.647
did have some energy initiative. Well, our first 
priority was to do the zoning ordinance. And it

02:30.489 --> 02:34.714
took about a year, year and a half, very 
controversial. They had a 25-year-old zoning

02:34.794 --> 02:39.979
ordinance, Beaumont, that historically did 
anti-regulation. They had passed zoning in

02:39.999 --> 02:42.201
something like 1948. And then the year after that, 
the public referendum, they rejected zoning. And

02:47.546 --> 02:51.130
then back in about 1954, 55, the zoning wave came 
again and basically the development community

02:51.110 --> 03:02.212
produced an ordinance that, you know, was kind of 
one of those things where if we're going to have

02:51.110 --> 03:02.212
zoning, it might be something we can live with. So 
we had this ordinance. It was only about 40 pages

03:03.875 --> 03:06.660
long. Very skimpy, cumulative zoning. It was more 
of a devious kind of ordinance. The district

03:14.436 --> 03:25.447
labels, for example, didn't link up to what the 
district really was, so you could come in and get R3

03:14.436 --> 03:25.447
zoning, residential multifamily zoning, and 
they ended up allowing commercial, too. It was all

03:25.467 --> 03:35.877
sorts of... Well, then you revised the zoning 
ordinance, and then after that, what was the...

03:25.467 --> 03:35.877
Revised the zoning ordinance, very 
controversial, very emotional experience. It

03:36.278 --> 03:38.700
took us a year and a half because the ordinance was 
so old. Recall was threatened. Lots of things

03:40.980 --> 03:42.162
happened there. But when the smoke finally 
cleared on that, we got a new ordinance in place

03:42.202 --> 03:51.197
that's a very good format, good model for the 
format that can be used by other places. To

03:51.738 --> 04:00.772
implement, as part of the implementation 
process, we incorporated some aspects of our plan

03:51.738 --> 04:00.772
into our zoning ordinance, which makes that a 
little bit unique in that sense. And we used that as

04:00.792 --> 04:05.380
a springboard then to develop our comprehensive 
plan. They had been trying to do a comprehensive

04:05.360 --> 04:10.207
plan for about five years, but there was a lot of 
data in place. It meant in a very short period of

04:10.827 --> 04:17.476
time, less than a year, we were able to reduce the 
land use. Really, the first element was the park

04:17.677 --> 04:24.746
and open space element, followed shortly 
thereafter by the land use element of the

04:17.677 --> 04:24.746
comprehensive plan. We did the park and open space 
because, A, we needed something less

04:24.766 --> 04:30.374
controversial at the zoning ordinance. We had to 
try to earn our spurs and win our way back into the

04:30.394 --> 04:34.860
community. So we did the park and open space plan, 
did establish the process and the format,

04:35.144 --> 04:47.160
issue-oriented planning process with 
measurable objectives as a result of the final

04:35.144 --> 04:47.160
product. We had a plan that we called, that we 
described as the goals, objectives, policies,

04:47.220 --> 04:53.227
and proposals. We presented this in the graphic 
format. We tried to use the unified submarine

04:55.190 --> 04:58.234
approach of Kent. We produced, our plan that was 
actually published was a fold-out brochure that

05:03.308 --> 05:07.576
fit into the pocket of the plan itself. The next 
step was to do the land use plan. The land use plan

05:12.065 --> 05:13.788
was completed while I was there. We were able to go 
through one and I think two update cycles of the

05:13.808 --> 05:21.503
park and open space plan where we, in essence, 
evaluated our accomplishments during the past

05:21.483 --> 05:31.982
year, identified new issues that emerged, 
proposed solutions or treatments to those

05:21.483 --> 05:31.982
issues, and set a work program for the following 
year. We called it an action plan, which was really

05:32.082 --> 05:39.155
a one-year detailed program for implementation 
of our plan. We were able to start the cycle on the

05:39.415 --> 05:42.040
land use element. When the plans were adopted, 
they contained language that required that they

05:42.205 --> 05:50.073
be reviewed and updated annually, and report from 
the staff and commission actioned by the city

05:42.205 --> 05:50.073
council. Did it bother you at all that the zoning 
ordinance rewrite preceded the development of

05:50.454 --> 05:59.083
the comprehensive plan? Sure. In theory, you 
know, we all, everybody knows the theory that we

05:59.403 --> 06:03.247
should be planning before we do zoning. And the one 
reason it took us a year and a half to do the zoning

06:03.687 --> 06:09.934
was because we did some of the planning. With your 
left hand while you were doing the zoning with your

06:09.914 --> 06:12.717
right, I suppose. Well, and we integrated into the 
ordinance. I mean, because people couldn't

06:14.659 --> 06:16.060
understand. If we had been trying to do the 
planning on the side, we wouldn't have gone very

06:16.100 --> 06:19.544
far. So we took elements of the plan, the 
principles, concepts, and standards for

06:19.584 --> 06:25.750
residential, commercial, and industrial 
development. These were actually integrated

06:26.050 --> 06:29.774
into the text of the plan itself. So there was an 
understanding of the planning foundation of the

06:30.255 --> 06:34.259
ordinance that we were going through. This was the 
only thing I could do because The priority was to do

06:36.661 --> 06:39.747
the update to zoning ordinance. The council 
wanted it, the manager wanted it, so we had to

06:39.767 --> 06:43.374
pursue it. What's really ironic about that is when 
the development community tried to stop the

06:43.975 --> 06:58.483
updating process, and that's one reason why I drug 
out for a year and a half, but as their last gas

06:43.975 --> 06:58.483
effort to stop it, they started lecturing the 
council that it was important that you do planning

06:59.240 --> 07:09.933
before you do zoning, and that we ought to defer the 
plan, the zoning, until we can complete updating

06:59.240 --> 07:09.933
the comprehensive plan. That's ironic. Yeah, it 
was really, really interesting. And, of course,

07:14.619 --> 07:21.168
once we finished the plan, the ordinance, the 
development community said, well, what's all the

07:14.619 --> 07:21.168
rush on the plan now? Uh-huh. Sure. But it was 
actually the Chamber of Commerce that was beating

07:24.383 --> 07:29.831
the drums at the very end for a comprehensive plan. 
It's the way it ought to be. Yes, it should have

07:32.475 --> 07:33.336
been. Where were they when I got there? So I was 
there three and a half, four years and the last

07:36.841 --> 07:41.768
thing that we did was the capital improvements 
program. The first time that city had a legitimate

07:44.285 --> 07:57.800
real world program, capital improvements 
program with priorities, analysis of the fiscal

07:44.285 --> 07:57.800
funding sources, identification of where the 
money was going to come from to fund the various

07:44.285 --> 07:57.800
capital projects. And the plan itself was 
reviewed annually, I suppose, as a basis for the

07:58.441 --> 08:02.125
CIP. The plan, in fact, that was the first block we 
checked was conformance with the plan and whether

08:02.145 --> 08:11.535
or not we were integrating or implementing the 
comprehensive plan. Are there any cities that

08:11.718 --> 08:20.953
you're aware of in Texas that have this kind of 
relationship between zoning and CIP and the

08:11.718 --> 08:20.953
conference plans? No, to my knowledge, the 
Beaumont system is just far superior. We took the

08:26.441 --> 08:28.825
theory and we made it work there. Terrific 
opportunity. You know, again, the manager was

08:30.367 --> 08:31.749
there. We had, Maury Myers was the mayor who was 
He's probably the most outstanding mayor in the

08:35.275 --> 08:38.202
United States. He and Henry Cisneros are peas in a 
pod in terms of their judgmental leadership

08:38.242 --> 08:43.595
ability. He resigned, or when his term was up, he 
did not run again. And he is now the mayor again

08:47.664 --> 08:51.393
because of all the trouble they're having. In 
Beaumont, he came back. and put himself back in the

08:53.618 --> 08:56.661
harness and ran for office again. Because of the 
economy? Because of the economy and the downturn.

08:59.405 --> 09:02.889
He was just that kind of a person that he couldn't 
turn his back on his community. When he didn't run

09:04.470 --> 09:07.614
again, it wasn't because the community didn't 
want him. It was that he wanted to do other things,

09:07.754 --> 09:10.698
and he had given his public service. Just looking 
back over your career here in Texas, beginning

09:12.079 --> 09:18.867
with Corpus Christi and then moving on to 
Galveston and then Beaumont and Fort Worth, It

09:19.420 --> 09:44.989
sounds to me like you tried certain things out 
initially in Corpus Christi and were frustrated

09:19.420 --> 09:44.989
there because of management and the whole 
political climate, then moved on to Gauss and you

09:19.420 --> 09:44.989
were able to do a little bit more, and then when you 
got to Beaumont you found that the ground had

09:19.420 --> 09:44.989
already been fertilized, so that you were given 
more or less a free hand to exercise theory and

09:45.290 --> 09:47.736
apply it to a practical situation. That's a very 
good summary. There is no question that in terms of

09:49.480 --> 09:54.451
effectiveness, my most effective program was 
BOVA. On a scale of 1 to 10, it was a 9. In Galveston,

10:00.848 --> 10:07.016
Because I was there shorter and there was so much 
less that I could do, I would say my effectiveness

10:00.848 --> 10:07.016
was a seven. But I was real pleased with the 
Galveston achievements, too. We were able to, the

10:09.980 --> 10:12.162
bottom line was results. We produced big results. 
There was tremendous payback in Galveston. But in

10:15.987 --> 10:20.934
Beaumont, I was able to put the theory to practice 
and something to come from it. And the

10:21.414 --> 10:24.558
implementation resulted and took place. So it was 
a planner's dream. Now, you were in Beaumont at the

10:28.220 --> 10:33.327
time that you were elected to the presidency of 
APA. That's right. What were the circumstances

10:34.589 --> 10:40.057
that prompted you to run for national office? 
Well, I had been president of the Texas chapter of

10:40.077 --> 10:46.326
APA. Who was the vice president then? Who was the 
vice president then? I couldn't tell you. I don't

10:54.962 --> 10:55.663
know. You'll find out. It's funny. Sarah Jane was 
the secretary and treasurer on that board. I do not

11:02.476 --> 11:04.439
remember who the vice president was. We'll fill it 
in later. In my involvement is the chapter

11:07.285 --> 11:09.850
president. I serve in the chapter president's 
council, which is a board of chapter presidents

11:09.950 --> 11:22.013
all across the country that meets at the national 
level and advise and serves in a little bit of an

11:09.950 --> 11:22.013
advisory capacity to the national APA board. 
Well, in that capacity, we dealt with primarily

11:22.614 --> 11:29.226
the budget issue. increasing the dues and the 
National Board was of the opinion we needed to

11:29.206 --> 11:35.842
increase our dues a substantial amount, 20, 25 
percent. I was of the opinion and other members of

11:37.065 --> 11:46.067
the chapter that if there was a big gap between the 
National Board and what the members and what the

11:37.065 --> 11:46.067
members felt and wanted from their organization. 
And I met those people on the National Board and

11:48.147 --> 11:54.540
they were respected, influential, higher up 
people in planning. And my assessment of them was

11:55.201 --> 11:58.708
that they weren't close to the customer. That they 
had been involved in the profession for so many

11:58.728 --> 12:05.001
years and had risen to such a level that they 
couldn't remember their roots. their

12:05.487 --> 12:12.877
experiences as planter ones and planter twos, and 
they didn't have contact with these entry-level

12:05.487 --> 12:12.877
or mid-range type planters. So they didn't know 
what the heart of the profession was all about

12:13.298 --> 12:16.943
anymore. And I thought they were insensitive and 
uncaring in a sense, and very egotistical. It was

12:22.851 --> 12:25.395
almost the all AICP kind of thing. I really did 
perceive that they didn't really care. And we

12:27.838 --> 12:34.988
thought and we did a lot of work as the chapter 
presidents to advise the APA board. And the

12:38.370 --> 12:45.437
response from the APA board was just to brush us off 
as if we didn't know anything, didn't have

12:38.370 --> 12:45.437
anything to contribute. And their view was they 
knew as much about the organization and the needs

12:46.158 --> 12:55.567
of the members as we did, and that they were in touch 
with the membership and it was us, the chapter

12:46.158 --> 12:55.567
presidents, that were out of touch. And the 
national board, as I remember at that time, had

12:56.528 --> 13:05.076
historically been composed of people from The 
Eastern Seaboard community. From the Eastern

13:06.622 --> 13:16.010
Seaboard, and they were predominantly 
academicians with a sprinkling of practicing

13:06.622 --> 13:16.010
consultants. Probably on a 21-member board, I 
think only two or three may have been city planner

13:16.030 --> 13:26.720
types, you know, senior planners, or they were 
most of, you know, a planning director kind of

13:16.030 --> 13:26.720
person. Sure. They were not what the heart of the 
organization was. Because we can't put down

13:30.243 --> 13:31.864
academicians. No, only in the sense of the 
domination. I don't think. I saw something that

13:35.583 --> 13:42.292
says that the academic community constitutes 8% 
or 9% of the APA membership. If you're

13:42.753 --> 13:48.922
representing 8% of the membership and you have 60% 
of the board, there's an imbalance there. And

13:49.583 --> 13:51.806
there was an imbalance. So I came home and I was 
madder than hell from the meeting. And the more I

13:55.571 --> 13:59.717
started paying attention to what APA was doing, 
and the little newsletters that they would send

13:59.697 --> 14:03.004
out in their news and whatever it is. It became 
clearer and clearer to me that there wasn't

14:03.485 --> 14:13.605
grassroots inaction there, that the board had 
lost touch with the membership. other chapter

14:13.906 --> 14:16.589
presidents shared this frustration with me. And 
they called me and said, and I had been, as you know

14:17.150 --> 14:25.840
me, I had been pretty visible in my capacity on the 
chapter presidents council. I'm very

14:25.920 --> 14:29.685
opinionated and I'm a strong fighter and a 
promoter. And so I've promoted our position very

14:30.166 --> 14:34.531
strongly and impressed some people. They felt 
like here's a person who cares and here's a person

14:35.011 --> 14:38.415
who can carry our banner. So there were folks that 
called me and said, we need to do something about

14:40.518 --> 14:50.394
billing candidates, running for the board, 
trying to make our position known, and have a

14:40.518 --> 14:50.394
referendum on what it is we're all about. So I said, 
well, let me see if we can find somebody. So I tried

14:53.699 --> 15:01.833
to call, I tried to get Mary Lou Henry, who was the 
person I knew most about, who just, I'd followed

14:53.699 --> 15:01.833
her as chapter president or at this point here. 
Really, she'd been out of office for one term

15:02.414 --> 15:04.878
before I followed her. And Mary Lou, was a 
knowledgeable, informed, educated, just

15:08.075 --> 15:12.101
outstanding individual. So I tried to get Mary Lou 
to run for the board and for the president. I said,

15:15.927 --> 15:17.269
that's how you're going to make a statement. One 
position out of 21 can't do anything unless it's

15:17.930 --> 15:21.436
the president. So I tried to talk Mary Lou into 
running. She was appreciative of the offer, but

15:24.861 --> 15:31.872
couldn't do it because a good friend of hers from 
California Okay, at Pomona.

15:37.697 --> 15:39.340
Cal State at Pomona. Margarita McCoy. Margarita 
McCoy had already been nominated and she couldn't

15:41.245 --> 15:45.815
run against Margarita. Well, we could run against 
Margarita. What it came down to is when I reported

15:49.452 --> 15:56.339
back to this little network that had been creating 
attractive presidents, a decision was made that I

15:49.452 --> 15:56.339
would run. I think everybody that really knows me 
has always understood that it wasn't me running

15:57.680 --> 16:04.166
because I wanted to run at that time. I really had 
other things to do. I had a new job, and it was up to my

16:05.428 --> 16:07.790
neck. And we couldn't recruit a viable candidate. 
And I had a lot of fire in the stomach, in the belly,

16:12.274 --> 16:15.898
as the expression goes. So I took on the challenge. 
I really didn't campaign that hard. I used the

16:21.814 --> 16:24.298
network that I had built up over the years. I ran 
through the nomination process. I had chapter

16:27.564 --> 16:30.709
presidents circulating my petition. I had over 
200 people from across the country that signed.

16:34.014 --> 16:35.297
You were a write-in candidate. Yes, I was a 
write-in candidate. Nobody had ever been

16:36.519 --> 16:40.024
successful as a write-in candidate before. 
Nobody wanted to try it again. And no one from Texas

16:41.883 --> 16:44.186
had been president before. No one from Texas had 
been president. We had one person that had served

16:46.048 --> 16:48.070
on the board. In fact, no one from the southwest 
part of the country had ever been president of APA.

16:53.056 --> 16:54.698
Sure, he had also been on the board. Of the old AIP. 
Yeah. Or ASPO. He'd been on the board of the old

16:58.943 --> 17:00.384
ASPO. And no city planner. had ever been president 
of APA. They had always been academicians. They

17:09.693 --> 17:11.601
had always been consultants. I was the first City 
planner. Practicing city planner to be on APA

17:14.439 --> 17:16.942
presidents. That's remarkable. Yeah. Or as polar 
AIP, according to the staff there in Washington.

17:22.369 --> 17:24.993
And they were able to do the research on things. We 
had people who had been practicing at some point in

17:25.013 --> 17:33.284
their career that had become presidents, but no 
sitting, no practicing person had done it. In

17:33.324 --> 17:39.653
terms of accomplishments you indicated before, 
there's

17:33.324 --> 17:39.653
a couple of them. The long term, the short term 
ones, were that I was able to take some very

17:41.840 --> 17:54.811
emotional, confrontational issues involving 
things like where's the office going to be

17:41.840 --> 17:54.811
located, what was going to happen to our magazine. 
There's some things I was able to do. And the

17:56.736 --> 17:59.663
position of the executive director. weren't able 
to do anything about the position of the executive

17:59.980 --> 18:02.468
director. That was very controversial. That was 
controversial, and the executive director

18:04.897 --> 18:08.409
survived. The board voted. The year I took office, 
the board voted. to retain his installment as

18:13.160 --> 18:16.906
executive director by one vote. With, 
ironically, again enough, the student

18:16.926 --> 18:23.515
representative on the board casting the deciding 
vote. Really? So I often tell students... Who was

18:24.797 --> 18:26.820
that, McNutt? No, it was a fellow from Yemigai, 
from back east, Cincinnati or someplace. But for

18:33.430 --> 18:42.964
students who often say, why should I get involved 
in APA, how can I make a difference, or whatever it

18:33.430 --> 18:42.964
was, one student cast one vote that made a 
difference as to our executive director. In my

18:43.636 --> 18:51.581
election, there were also some other malcontents 
that were elected, some people that didn't like

18:43.636 --> 18:51.581
the system. This was the first emergence, really, 
of the Dan Lauber faction into outreach capacity.

18:58.047 --> 19:11.247
There was a Lauber faction consisting of people 
like Bill Toner and Edie Netter and himself, but

18:58.047 --> 19:11.247
they were former APA PASPOL staffers who used to 
work for the organization. You'd come back in, you

19:11.267 --> 19:17.156
understood the system, knew how to manipulate it, 
knew how to win an election process and they were

19:11.267 --> 19:17.156
there. Well this was the first year that Lauber 
reached out How do you say that? L-A-U-B-E-R.

19:21.184 --> 19:24.930
L-A-U-B-E-R. And his first name is? Daniel. Dan. 
And there was a faction on the board. There was this

19:29.497 --> 19:33.623
more of the old-timer, elitist group. They'd be 
classified or described as the AICP faction. And

19:38.231 --> 19:46.824
then there was this Lauber faction that was 
started out in the guise of, he called it the good

19:38.231 --> 19:46.824
old planter, which was the average planter out 
there. And Lauber thought, that the board was

19:48.520 --> 19:50.985
missing. He thought like I did in that sense, that 
the board wasn't responsive. Now as time evolved

19:55.936 --> 20:09.364
and as my term went on, I learned after about a year 
that Dan Lauber basically had his own views of the

19:55.936 --> 20:09.364
organization and that his views really were not 
grassroots, that he really didn't have a desire to

20:09.732 --> 20:23.491
listen to the customer, so to speak, and be 
responsive to the membership, as much as he had his

20:09.732 --> 20:23.491
own ideas of what the membership wanted, and he 
felt like it ought to be run in that fashion. So in a

20:24.032 --> 20:31.983
sense, in my experience on the board, was he 
started replacing the elitism of AICP with the

20:24.032 --> 20:31.983
elitism of Dan Lauber. And I came in as the 
grassroots. Bill from the bottom up. And I think

20:38.256 --> 20:43.784
one of my contributions is the involvement is that 
I became a focal point. I needed credibility to

20:43.944 --> 20:47.249
this perspective. And chapter presidents like 
Jim Duncan linked up with him. From Florida. From

20:53.217 --> 20:54.079
Florida. Yeah, from Florida. linked up and saw, 
and I gave them a focal point for them to become

20:54.940 --> 21:08.087
involved in, and I pointed them to positions on the 
board, both Jim and Norman Staniford, who's also

20:54.940 --> 21:08.087
from Florida. People who were the grassroots kind 
of organization, very non-assuming,

21:13.182 --> 21:14.624
Unegotistical. Folks who cared about the 
organization, who cared about making the

21:15.185 --> 21:19.771
organization more responsive to the members. 
Folks who believed in the Toffler and the, who

21:20.411 --> 21:27.601
wrote the Megatrends. That's the deal about 
building from the grassroots into what's the

21:28.362 --> 21:33.589
problem with these large organizations. And we 
put something in place, we put our system in place,

21:34.170 --> 21:40.658
which was basically using the mechanism of the 
chapter presidents to battle Lauber's system in

21:40.638 --> 21:48.047
place, which was his Inside AGA newsletter and the 
network that had been built up in that newsletter

21:40.638 --> 21:48.047
over the years. Again, Lauber's newsletter was 
intended to manipulate and get backing behind him

21:49.048 --> 22:03.865
for his positions, as opposed to the chapter 
presidents, who really went out with the

21:49.048 --> 22:03.865
grassroots, open mind, let us be responsive to 
what you can do. Where is Lauber? Where does he come

22:05.987 --> 22:06.748
from? Lauber's in Chicago, and he's got his own 
quasi-consulting firm. He just, you know, he

22:11.796 --> 22:16.207
probably reports $15,000 a year income or 
something. A very modest living fellow who was

22:16.267 --> 22:23.365
working on the law degree when he was on the board. 
In fact, got his, passed his bar exam the year he was

22:23.385 --> 22:27.435
president. My last year, my first year on the 
board, I was completely ineffective. The only

22:32.281 --> 22:38.548
thing I accomplished in that first year was moving 
the APA conference from the national conference

22:32.281 --> 22:38.548
from Houston to San Antonio. My second year as 
president, I was relatively effective because

22:39.669 --> 22:45.896
there were some outsiders that were brought in on 
the board. The first year I was elected, there were

22:45.916 --> 22:49.120
more that were brought in the second year. And I 
started to earn some respect on my positions. And

22:54.410 --> 22:56.697
basically, it's like anything you go into. I was an 
outsider. I was not trusted. I was put down in my

23:00.541 --> 23:02.123
first year. Second year, people respected the 
heck out of me. I did some very positive things. We

23:07.310 --> 23:10.233
built, we pulled, as opposed to destroying. First 
year, I came in relatively negative. Second year,

23:12.897 --> 23:18.504
I was able to build some things as a president and 
appoint some committees to make things happen.

23:18.524 --> 23:23.830
And we were able to resolve some very 
controversial emotional issues that had dogged

23:18.524 --> 23:23.830
the organization for many years. And so in a sense, 
I wasted a lot of my year in office Solving the

23:28.570 --> 23:37.222
agenda, the problems that had existed for a number 
of years, I really wasn't able to do as much as I

23:28.570 --> 23:37.222
wanted to do and go into the areas that I wanted to 
do. But I was effective for the organization. And,

23:41.447 --> 23:49.298
uh, and the other board members told me at the end of 
my term that I had been more effective than they

23:41.447 --> 23:49.298
could remember in many, many, many years. And 
they're very complimentary. as to my term in

23:51.115 --> 23:52.319
office. And it's self-supporting for me to say 
this. And I hope as a follow-up on this, you might

23:53.984 --> 24:01.446
call the installment and ask him to assess my term 
in office. When my term was up and I turned the gavel

24:01.763 --> 24:11.279
over to Dan Lauber to come in and take my place, 
there was enthusiastic applause from the board

24:01.763 --> 24:11.279
who was in place. And Iz told me they couldn't 
remember that ever happening before. And he said

24:15.246 --> 24:21.797
it was sincere, it was genuine, it was really a 
reflection of people's appreciation toward my

24:15.246 --> 24:21.797
term in office. So I felt, as an egotist, I felt very 
pleased with that. My third year on the board, as an

24:26.262 --> 24:32.228
immediate past president, was a complete wasted 
year. Basically, it was a year where I tried to stop

24:32.689 --> 24:37.975
the things that Dan Lauber was doing. Instead of 
being positive, I basically had to go into a, let's

24:38.675 --> 24:45.303
just, you know, reactive, and let's just try to 
stop this guy for one year. I was trying to live

24:45.323 --> 24:46.764
through it. So that was disappointing. What was 
his basic point of view? What was he trying to do

24:50.853 --> 24:52.738
with APA? He was trying to kill AICP. He was trying 
to dismantle the divisions. He was trying to

24:59.053 --> 25:02.802
strangle, cut off the resources to the chapters. 
Basically, he was trying to recreate an ASCO

25:04.145 --> 25:07.714
organization. which is the organization he was 
exposed to as an employee. He had worked for ASPO.

25:14.282 --> 25:16.407
So he had worked for them, and he liked that kind of 
environment. He tried to go back and recreate it. I

25:20.295 --> 25:24.184
tend to come from the grassroots volunteer 
perspective, and I wanted to see the organization

25:24.788 --> 25:30.193
build on the strength of our volunteers, not be 
centralized. I was promoting decentralization,

25:30.353 --> 25:33.516
he was promoting centralization. Well, that was 
the basic difference between ASPO and APA, or AIP

25:34.017 --> 25:47.590
in those days, was that AIP had a chapter 
structure, and it could rely on its membership

25:34.017 --> 25:47.590
throughout the country. What I tried to do was take 
the strengths of both organizations and build on

25:51.434 --> 25:58.847
them and get rid of the weaknesses and weed those 
things out, the things that we weren't doing well

25:51.434 --> 25:58.847
or that were detrimental. There were many things 
ASPO did that are very solid, such as the technical

26:00.209 --> 26:04.797
publications. No question, they had a superior 
Their program was of more value to me growing up as a

26:07.162 --> 26:10.686
planner than AIP. AIP did a better job of sharing 
the grassroots, the networking kind of thing, to

26:11.327 --> 26:22.061
check the functions, getting out where I was as an 
entry-level person where I couldn't go to some of

26:11.327 --> 26:22.061
the national things. So what we really needed to do 
after the merger was do the best of both. And there

26:29.390 --> 26:30.992
wasn't a faction. that was opposed to anything of 
an old-ass pope, and there was a faction that was

26:31.293 --> 26:36.079
opposed to anything of the AIP. The last year, my 
year's presidency, the factions really

26:36.720 --> 26:41.627
disintegrated and disappeared. The AICP elitism 
was no longer there, but there was this

26:41.667 --> 26:53.402
emerging-ass pope thing that was very difficult 
to deal with, very emotional and

26:41.667 --> 26:53.402
confrontational.

26:54.964 --> 26:57.047
One of the lasting contributions I made was this 
these charter amendments where we provided for

26:57.652 --> 27:03.734
AICP to elect AICP to elect their own board. We had a 
vicious cycle that was taking place where whoever

27:04.156 --> 27:09.214
ran with the strongest position against AICP was 
getting elected to the AICP board. We were

27:13.473 --> 27:16.418
literally bringing in people that were opposed to 
the organization. So it became very important, if

27:17.140 --> 27:26.736
we're going to save it, to switch the balloting 
procedures so that AICP votes for AICP and the AICP

27:17.140 --> 27:26.736
commission. The board is too complex to talk about 
now, but there's an APA board and an AICP

27:26.757 --> 27:31.204
commission. I think that charter change which Dan 
Louder fought like hell to stop, is what saved this

27:33.747 --> 27:38.039
organization. If we didn't do that, I think even as 
early now as now, we would have a separatist

27:38.059 --> 27:44.035
movement. We'd have a separate old AIP 
organization back again. Or it could have

27:49.778 --> 27:55.026
possibly disintegrated into any number of 
regional professional organizations. Well, in

27:55.126 --> 27:57.569
truth, that's what Jim Duncan and I were going to 
do. As Florida chapter president, Jim, and I as

27:57.609 --> 28:07.764
Texas chapter president, we were going to create a 
Gulf Coast Planning Association with our

27:57.609 --> 28:07.764
membership at both ends providing the anchor. And 
we had enough of a resource base. And it would have

28:09.587 --> 28:12.130
killed APA. Yeah, it would have. But we weren't 
interested in killing APA. We were really

28:15.095 --> 28:17.338
interested in trying to get their attention. and 
build a stronger organization based on the

28:17.723 --> 28:25.073
grassroots permeation of our organization. Well 
then, after Lauber left office, what... Well, now

28:25.634 --> 28:35.447
we have Norm Krumholz as president, and Norm 
doesn't have a mission. Norm's not obsessed. He

28:37.891 --> 28:41.115
basically has an academic orientation. and he's 
just going to preside over the organization for a

28:41.483 --> 28:44.345
year. Next year, Jim Duncan will assume a chapter 
of the national presidency. And Jim has this

28:49.170 --> 28:55.595
chapter bias, this action orientation, the 
culture of the consumer business philosophy. And

28:56.136 --> 28:59.939
you will see the organization become much more 
responsive next year. As this labor element

29:00.079 --> 29:06.985
dissipates, the housekeeping of Krumholz will 
consume this year. And then Jim will really have a

29:07.506 --> 29:10.208
stage set for him to get in there And also the big 
change is that Jim will have a two-year term. That

29:14.306 --> 29:17.410
was one of the other changes we made in our 
amendment process. We revised our charter. That

29:18.632 --> 29:20.154
makes a lot of sense. Longer term in office. One 
year, I was able to do some things. A lot more than

29:23.738 --> 29:25.561
people thought I could in one year. If I could have 
had another year as president, I could have had an

29:25.681 --> 29:30.687
even greater or more long-term lasting impact. Oh 
yeah, I'm sure. It takes about a year to get used to

29:32.630 --> 29:35.233
any different thing. So that Jim Duncan will be the 
second Texan to be a national president. That's

29:40.921 --> 29:41.221
correct. He'll be the second practicing planner 
to make national president. Well, let's move on

29:45.348 --> 29:46.389
then. We've talked about Beaumont, and we've 
talked about your role with National APA and, of

29:47.351 --> 29:55.003
course, the Texas Chapter APA. Now we are in Fort 
Worth. How about if I hit Arlington for about five

29:58.468 --> 30:01.853
minutes? Okay. All right. We don't want to forget 
Arlington. Yeah, Arlington, I'd like to forget

30:05.777 --> 30:08.061
Arlington. Everybody has an Arlington in their 
record somewhere, and I've got one, and that's

30:08.201 --> 30:14.812
Arlington. In contrast to Beaumont, which was the 
height of my career in terms of effectiveness,

30:14.832 --> 30:22.285
Arlington was the absolute low point in my career 
in effectiveness. I was not able to institute the

30:23.146 --> 30:29.537
programs and produce the products and results 
that I wanted to do. What were the reasons for that?

30:31.798 --> 30:42.812
Well, I came into a community that was very smug, a 
sense of arrogance, of superiority, that they

30:31.798 --> 30:42.812
were God's gift to the world. You know, Arlington 
had grown tremendously in population in the past

30:43.593 --> 30:53.265
10 or 20 years, from a population of 20,000 to 200 
and almost 50,000. Rapid growth. They made the

30:55.568 --> 30:59.693
classic management mistake of... assuming that 
luck was good management. They assumed, because

31:03.388 --> 31:08.376
everything was relatively okay, that what they'd 
been doing was profitable. In fact, it was the

31:08.857 --> 31:10.480
Houston Syndrome. They were in an ideal location 
between Dallas and Fort Worth. They were gaining

31:14.888 --> 31:19.015
all the benefits of everybody around them. 
through no fault of their own or no actions of their

31:19.670 --> 31:22.574
own, their location. It was a traditional real 
estate story about one of the three most important

31:22.614 --> 31:31.508
factors in real estate investment, location, 
location, location. Hey, Arlington had the

31:31.548 --> 31:32.970
location. They had a strong mayor who early in his 
career He used a Chamber of Commerce approach. He

31:38.727 --> 31:43.872
brought in General Motors and Washington 
Senators, became a Texas Rangers. What was his

31:44.433 --> 31:45.694
name? Vandergrift. Outstanding individual. He 
had the Chevrolet Buick. Chevrolet dealer, yeah.

31:50.880 --> 31:53.362
Well, wasn't he also big in Texas Municipal 
League? I doubt it. If he was, it would surprise me,

31:54.764 --> 31:56.826
but he might have been. He had more of a Chamber of 
Commerce approach, not really in the government.

32:01.271 --> 32:04.614
So I'd be surprised if he was involved in a 
government organization, but he could have been.

32:05.415 --> 32:06.096
But... had a planning commission that was 
dominated by a real estate interest. I said, well,

32:12.143 --> 32:16.008
good grief, who's on here that represents the 
citizens? And there was one woman on there,

32:16.028 --> 32:20.033
housewife, and she was working for the Chamber of 
Commerce. And I said, well, how about the guy from

32:20.333 --> 32:23.196
the university? I said, geez, at least there's an 
academic influence on here. And it turns out that

32:26.100 --> 32:35.391
he was from the School of Business at UTA, which has 
a completely different philosophy than a liberal

32:26.100 --> 32:35.391
arts kind of professor or somebody. So you had a 
commission that was hostile. We had a city manager

32:38.295 --> 32:42.123
that says, it's time for us to do planning. We 
haven't done it for 25 years. We're paying for it.

32:44.788 --> 32:53.025
Arlington has an extraordinary amount of bonded 
indebtedness, far more than any other city. 60% of

32:53.714 --> 32:58.262
the budget is used to retire bond and debt, you 
know, and the rule of thumb is 25%. But it happened

32:59.023 --> 33:01.207
because they bought that growth. Here this growth 
was coming anyway, but they subsidized the

33:01.227 --> 33:04.352
development community. They did a fiscal impact 
study in the late 70s that showed that the

33:04.793 --> 33:16.313
population of the city had grown, the population 
had grown 50% during this study period. Bonded

33:16.698 --> 33:21.948
indebtedness had gone up something like 900%, and 
per capita debt had gone up 400%. So nobody could

33:22.149 --> 33:28.802
say that the debt was occurring because of the 
growth. The debt was occurring because they

33:29.283 --> 33:31.968
subsidized too much of it. They just underwrote 
the growth at public expense. When this study was

33:35.969 --> 33:42.956
done, by the way, they boxed it up and shoved it in 
the closet. It was never released to the public.

33:44.378 --> 33:48.782
The public didn't know the significance of those 
fiscal implications. But Vandegrift did, and his

33:48.802 --> 33:57.831
last act as he left when that study was there, they 
changed some of the participation policies, and

33:48.802 --> 33:57.831
the city was paying less from 77 or 78 on. They paid 
less when Vandegrift left. From that point on, The

34:01.805 --> 34:06.094
developers had to pay a higher proportion of their 
costs. The manager knew changes had to occur. The

34:09.220 --> 34:16.394
council, which was politically responsive to the 
community, understood there was a growing

34:09.220 --> 34:16.394
groundswell of interest in preserving the 
quality of life. The people were afraid they were

34:16.414 --> 34:20.202
losing what had brought them to Arlington to start 
with. So, they went out, they recruited very

34:20.975 --> 34:29.866
heavily to bring in a really innovative, 
aggressive, you know, doer-oriented,

34:20.975 --> 34:29.866
results-oriented planer. And I competed with 
some real good people, including somebody that's

34:30.206 --> 34:35.412
up here in the Metroplex, Matt Plano. I'm not sure 
if you remember his name now. It's not my name

34:37.755 --> 34:39.057
today. He's the planer director in Plano. Planer 
director in Plano. But he's the North Central

34:41.620 --> 34:45.184
Texas chapter president. Yeah, I know. I'll 
remember. We'll fill that in. So the manager

34:49.105 --> 34:54.737
wanted somebody good and the council wanted 
somebody good, but they forgot to tell the

34:49.105 --> 34:54.737
commission that they wanted somebody good. In my 
first week in office or in town, they took me out to

34:55.097 --> 35:00.990
dinner, the planning commission did. They asked 
me what my plans were, what my philosophy was, what

35:01.010 --> 35:06.962
I liked and didn't like, various things. And like 
an idiot, I just told them, you know, hey, here's

35:07.415 --> 35:14.484
what I like, here's what I can do, here's where we 
can do better, here's where we're doing great. But

35:15.285 --> 35:35.970
after that dinner, the following week prior to the 
planning commission, I got visited by the

35:15.285 --> 35:35.970
chairman of the commission, the vice chairman, 
and they told me they were real disappointed in the

35:15.285 --> 35:35.970
answers I had given, that they wanted to make sure I 
understood how it was going to be in Arlington, and

35:15.285 --> 35:35.970
that, number one, nothing was broke, so therefore 
absolutely nothing was going to get fixed. And

35:36.625 --> 35:37.927
that I should understand that. And that if I wanted 
to be successful there, what I needed to do was to

35:38.668 --> 35:43.816
get involved in a hobby. Get involved with 
Arlington Initiative, which was a

35:45.219 --> 35:53.432
goals-oriented local citizen group that the last 
planning director, Jill Potthoff, had started.

35:53.472 --> 35:54.814
Get involved with APA. Anyway, do whatever I 
wanted to do outside local government. But not to

35:58.900 --> 36:06.650
get involved with anything that was going on that 
had been going on, that everybody was satisfied

35:58.900 --> 36:06.650
with the status quo. And that I would have real 
serious personal and professional problems if I

36:07.311 --> 36:14.440
messed with them. Well, I passed this on to the city 
manager, and the city manager said these people

36:14.460 --> 36:21.469
are dinosaurs, they're out of date, this change is 
coming. The council wants a change, and that's why

36:22.230 --> 36:27.557
he hired me, and he expected me to see me make those 
changes. So, yeah I started off in an adversarial

36:28.448 --> 36:34.917
relationship with the commission. And for the 
next two or three months it deteriorated because

36:34.937 --> 36:43.369
as I continued to bring new programs and ideas, 
they continued to tell me to drop dead and go to

36:34.937 --> 36:43.369
hell, you know, get lost. Then a real bad thing 
happened. The city manager who'd been there 20

36:46.473 --> 36:53.863
years resigned and went into the private sector, 
into the investment business. That was a career

36:53.883 --> 36:56.447
move he'd wanted to make for some time. So he made 
that transition. One of the assistant city

37:00.567 --> 37:07.175
managers became the acting manager for a period of 
about three or four months, five months, six

37:00.567 --> 37:07.175
months. During that period of time, I became so 
disgusted with my ineffectiveness with the

37:08.997 --> 37:16.647
commission and their ability to stop everything 
that I that I attempted to resign. I went upstairs

37:18.477 --> 37:20.839
and the manager said I'm through. Life is too 
short. I've got too much I want to accomplish. I'm

37:25.223 --> 37:30.288
going to blow off six months of my life here in an 
ineffective environment. And I said, the truth of

37:30.388 --> 37:32.970
it is I know I can't be effective here. These people 
are too skilled at maintaining the status quo.

37:36.934 --> 37:38.555
They're going to study us to death. Anything that 
we bring forward to them, they just give to a

37:38.575 --> 37:41.277
committee. And you won't see it for a couple of 
years. So the manager said that wasn't that he

37:46.934 --> 37:49.738
didn't share that view of my effectiveness, 
ineffectiveness. And he encouraged me to stay and

37:49.778 --> 37:53.544
lead everything they could do, et cetera. And he 
taught me to stay. Then five months later, we got a

37:55.546 --> 37:57.870
new city manager. I worked for him for about two 
months. I had a real blowout with the commission

37:59.292 --> 38:03.758
and council over whether or not we were going to do 
comprehensive planning. I went to the manager. I

38:04.820 --> 38:05.881
resigned again. And the new manager convinced me 
to stay. He said, you've only been here a month. You

38:10.468 --> 38:11.269
need more time. You need to be effective. We can do 
this. And here's what we can do to become more

38:13.552 --> 38:15.996
effective. And he got the council to go along with 
some things and put a lot of pressure on the

38:16.330 --> 38:19.775
commission. And so for the last year, we made 
progress. Slow, painful, drudging progress.

38:27.626 --> 38:31.331
Given me, if I had stayed there another couple of 
years, I could have been relatively effective. We

38:31.351 --> 38:36.939
could have had something in place in Arlington 
that I could have claimed credit for. But when this

38:38.321 --> 38:42.747
opportunity opened for work, it could be 
effective right away. It was a career

38:42.767 --> 38:44.349
advancement. It was a challenge. In truth, I was 
real pleased to get the chance to leave that

38:46.402 --> 38:49.967
environment. Now, Beaumont has got a good 
program. Arlington has got a good program in

38:52.290 --> 38:54.312
place. Rose Jacobson is now standing planning 
director. Ray Quay is the assistant over there.

38:59.699 --> 39:03.504
Ray is going to have a state-of-the-art 
comprehensive plan. For Arlington. For

39:05.086 --> 39:05.527
Arlington. It's going to take a year longer than I 
would have thought it would have taken, but the

39:05.707 --> 39:13.818
commission over there is still roadblocking it. 
There's been several resignations now. And the

39:16.253 --> 39:18.456
chairman is still hanging on. He wants to be there 
until the plan is finished. He was the biggest

39:20.779 --> 39:27.648
obstacle to completing the plan, and now he's 
stating his reputation on finishing the plan. He

39:27.688 --> 39:33.575
tried to stop it for years, and now it's the old 
thing we talk about in one of these other cities. If

39:33.595 --> 39:35.398
you're going to have something, you're in 
Beaumont. If you're going to have something, we

39:35.418 --> 39:38.121
may have something we can live with. So he's trying 
to make it something that he can live with. But it

39:41.966 --> 39:44.049
was very disappointing two years on my part. Real, 
real painful. And the planning director in

39:46.223 --> 39:49.112
Arlington is now Rose? Rose Jacobson. 
Outstanding. She is a hard worker, applies

39:51.802 --> 39:58.593
herself every day, and she knows more about 
playing each day than she did the day before.

39:58.693 --> 40:02.419
Constantly learning, constantly applying, and 
very strong. I laugh and call her the Dragon Lady

40:03.180 --> 40:10.591
sometimes, but she is a very effective 
administrator. Really a quality person. Very

40:11.653 --> 40:12.033
good. That's hopeful. Now to Fort Worth. Now to 
Fort Worth. What do you want to know about Fort

40:14.918 --> 40:16.520
Worth, Bob? What are you doing here at Fort Worth? 
How is your... What is the perception of the

40:20.075 --> 40:23.081
planning program in Fort Worth? The history of 
Fort Worth have already documented the ancient

40:23.141 --> 40:33.561
history of planning in Fort Worth, so we needn't go 
back to the Gruen Plan or any of that. But what we

40:33.929 --> 40:44.460
need to do is sort of pick up on what happened during 
the regime of the

40:33.929 --> 40:44.460
previous planning director. Okay. The previous 
planning director was James Toll, and James

40:45.701 --> 40:51.828
inherited a losing program. They had fired 
Stephen Andradeus and Darryl Noe. Planning was at

40:55.752 --> 41:03.700
the low ebb, heartbreaking when you consider the 
history that you just mentioned, the growing

40:55.752 --> 41:03.700
plant, etc., Fort Worth had a history of effective 
planning, respected planning across the

41:04.456 --> 41:10.535
country. And in the latter, in the late 60s and then 
in the 70s, in particular the latter part of the

41:17.888 --> 41:19.750
70s. Every year planning got hurt a little bit more 
than the year before. We lost a little bit of the

41:23.775 --> 41:25.938
prestige that was over here. Andre just killed it, 
finished it off, wiped it out. And it's not so much a

41:31.604 --> 41:34.868
reflection on him as it was at the times. Times 
change. People change. Values change. And your

41:37.792 --> 41:39.854
planning program has to change with that. You have 
to know when to go with the flow, when to be able to do

41:41.530 --> 41:50.007
something, when to look for the programs that 
people do want instead of trying to push what's no

41:41.530 --> 41:50.007
longer acceptable. In Fort Worth, it's been very 
effective in the citizen participation. There's

41:54.576 --> 42:00.067
still a world class examples on how to involve 
citizens in planning. But during the Andrade's

42:00.788 --> 42:03.133
regime, credibility and support for the plane 
just evaporated, disappeared, it was destroyed.

42:07.519 --> 42:10.924
James Toll came in and... Where did he come from? He 
was in the Parks Department. Been here many years,

42:13.027 --> 42:26.185
hard-working young fella that really, with an 
urban design background, and he came in and took on

42:13.027 --> 42:26.185
this job and in four years or thereabouts created 
tremendous public support and respect for

42:26.992 --> 42:31.298
planning. Again, that's a good word, again. And I, 
looking at him when I was in Beaumont and over in

42:33.962 --> 42:39.610
Arlington, I admired the heck out of him. I thought 
objectively that he was the most effective

42:39.810 --> 42:51.447
planner that we had during the early 1980s, that he 
did more, accomplished more in a hard, hot,

42:51.697 --> 42:58.644
political context, he was able to do something and 
establish credibility for this program that had

42:51.697 --> 42:58.644
been lost.

43:01.547 --> 43:13.379
He did it by taking on the big projects, by having 
influence, by earning the respect of the

43:01.547 --> 43:13.379
development community, the respect of the 
business community, the respect of the elected

43:01.547 --> 43:13.379
officials, respect for his judgment. He dealt 
with a big picture, the Southwest freeways, the

43:13.659 --> 43:18.904
cultural districts, the growth management 
programs. He saw the concept of these people. He

43:20.806 --> 43:29.935
made him, he sold the sizzle, you know, he put the 
sizzle back into planning and got people excited

43:20.806 --> 43:29.935
about planning again. And this is the legacy I 
inherit. Now that I'm in here, I more than anything

43:33.358 --> 43:38.323
else have to implement the vision that he's left in 
place. And our major workload here is involving

43:39.264 --> 43:50.695
the area of the Southwest Freeway, trying to do 
something with our cultural district,

43:39.264 --> 43:50.695
continuing the progress that's been made in our 
downtown, and lastly and most importantly, is

43:51.113 --> 43:55.359
implementing a growth management system. An 
extraordinary idea. You know, there are two

43:57.041 --> 44:06.273
cities in this state that are working on growth 
management systems, Austin and Fort Worth, and

43:57.041 --> 44:06.273
you couldn't think of two cities in greater 
contrast than Austin and Fort Worth. And the Fort

44:07.414 --> 44:11.720
Worth program is going to be successful, and I 
don't know if the Austin will well be. And you would

44:11.740 --> 44:15.805
think that it ought to be reversed, that when it 
really comes down to it, And the citizens and the

44:16.274 --> 44:22.381
business community really see what's in this for 
Fort Worth that they might back off growth

44:16.274 --> 44:22.381
management, but they won't. I think if anybody 
backs off it, it'll be Fort Worth. I mean, it'll be

44:25.465 --> 44:26.386
Austin. The only thing, Austin will panic when 
they have an economic downturn. And they'll fill

44:30.070 --> 44:35.237
the baby out with a wash, and they'll do away with 
their interest and enthusiasm for growth

44:30.070 --> 44:35.237
management. While Fort Worth is going to build on 
its heritage and become the model for the

44:35.257 --> 44:41.404
southwest of growth management. Well, it has a 
legacy of many, many years of planning, and I think

44:42.447 --> 44:49.760
that it probably will hold them in good stead as 
they move forward. You have to build. See, Bob, the

44:51.623 --> 44:55.730
beauty of Fort Worth is you can build on these 
victories that have been out there in the past. We

44:56.772 --> 44:58.254
need to update our sector plans. We don't need to 
wait eight or nine years like they've done in the

44:58.314 --> 45:02.382
past to update those things. We need to go into an 
annual updating mode. We need to take our old

45:04.823 --> 45:17.418
comprehensive plan that was done in 55 and combine 
it with the sector plans and the district plans in

45:04.823 --> 45:17.418
the growth management system and come up with a 
modern, state-of-the-art, updatable

45:04.823 --> 45:17.418
comprehensive plan. We're going to do that as part 
of the growth management system here. You take

45:21.082 --> 45:30.913
these victories, you take the sector plans that 
everybody knows they've got awards for, and you

45:21.082 --> 45:30.913
build on those and say, we've got to update these 
things, and we've got to integrate these into the

45:21.082 --> 45:30.913
growth management system now. You take the 
Chamber's work on strategic... strategic plan

45:34.355 --> 45:41.383
for economic development that everybody likes 
and is proud of and you integrate that into the

45:34.355 --> 45:41.383
growth management system. You take the 
neighborhood planning programs that have

45:41.403 --> 45:49.992
struggled here a little bit in the inner city under 
the block grant program and you repackage those

45:41.403 --> 45:49.992
under the guise of growth management. That in fact 
inner city development and prioritizing and

45:50.132 --> 45:59.482
encouraging development to turn into itself is a 
key critical part of growth management. Unlike in

45:59.502 --> 46:03.366
Austin or someplace that's looking at the 
periphery of growth management, We're looking at

46:03.667 --> 46:06.252
growth performance management. We want to 
identify these target areas where we want growth

46:06.272 --> 46:10.639
to occur, including our inner city. We want to put 
programs in place that encourage and induce

46:10.940 --> 46:15.688
development to take place. You build on the 
successes, you find the things that are working,

46:15.708 --> 46:22.620
and you paint whatever that is you're working on 
with that brush. It's like in Beaumont, one of the

46:22.718 --> 46:31.187
things we did besides putting all those plans in 
place, we shifted the philosophy to economic

46:22.718 --> 46:31.187
development. I tried to change the name of the 
program, of the department, to the Department of

46:31.387 --> 46:36.873
Planning and Economic Development. We pushed 
UDACs, we pushed grants, partner with space

46:37.574 --> 46:41.197
grants. In a city in two years, in a city that had 
been hostile to grants, federal grants, we

46:48.588 --> 46:51.631
brought in something like $11 or $12 million in 
grants. And a department budget that had $600,000

46:52.071 --> 47:01.961
or $700,000 in budgets for those two years, we 
brought in $11 million in federal grants and money

46:52.071 --> 47:01.961
to that area. Not block grants, not categorical 
grants that we were entitled to. These were

47:07.967 --> 47:10.469
categorical grants. These were competitive 
grants where we competed with other cities. We

47:14.793 --> 47:16.755
took our park and open space plan And our action 
plan that we had, and we competed in the urban parks

47:17.208 --> 47:21.962
and recreation recovery program. And in the first 
funding period, the first six months or three

47:22.423 --> 47:32.331
months of funding cycle, there was something like 
$280,000 available for the Southwest, the entire

47:22.423 --> 47:32.331
Southwest.
