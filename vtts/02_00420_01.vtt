WEBVTT

00:01.820 --> 00:03.582
and a member of the Special Forces. He has an 
opening statement he would like to make about what

00:04.683 --> 00:10.490
he will answer and what he won't answer. John? 
Okay, one of the conditions for me doing this

00:11.411 --> 00:27.508
interview is that I don't have to engage in any 
conversation or discussion about any particular

00:11.411 --> 00:27.508
combat experiences that I had in Vietnam, but I'm 
perfectly willing to discuss anything else.

00:29.010 --> 00:29.110
Okay.

00:48.496 --> 00:49.217
How's that? Does that make sense? It's fine. Okay. 
I guess the first thing I need to know is when did you

00:51.440 --> 00:56.468
go into the military? I went in the Army in 1966, 
right after I got out of high school. I enlisted in

01:03.278 --> 01:13.353
the Army in, I guess, June of 1966 under a kind of a 
delayed enlistment program, and I went in in

01:03.278 --> 01:13.353
September of 1966. Why did you enlist? I didn't 
have very many options, I guess. That's one reason

01:20.708 --> 01:26.155
why I enlisted was because I didn't do very well in 
high school. My family didn't have a lot of money,

01:27.577 --> 01:33.225
so they couldn't send me to college. And I had the 
idea that if I went into the Army, you know, I could

01:33.845 --> 01:43.238
get the veterans' benefits, and then maybe 
somehow by proving myself, you know, I could get

01:33.845 --> 01:43.238
into college. Another reason was simply just the 
idea of going in the Army sort of fascinated me. I

01:50.158 --> 01:53.160
just sort of wondered what it would be like. When I 
enlisted initially,

01:54.221 --> 02:03.710
I enlisted for three years, and I didn't know 
really what the Army was all about. I just knew I

02:03.730 --> 02:05.811
wanted to jump out of airplanes. So I enlisted in 
the Army, what they call airborne unassigned,

02:06.632 --> 02:12.237
which meant like a dummy. I hadn't picked a job that 
I was going to do in the Army. The recruiter never

02:18.490 --> 02:20.813
told me that you're supposed to have a job. I 
thought I was just going to, you know, get up in the

02:20.873 --> 02:24.617
morning and jump out of airplanes. And I didn't 
find out until after basic training, when they

02:25.377 --> 02:36.650
assigned me to military police training, that you 
had to have a job, you know, in the Army. When you

02:38.992 --> 02:44.118
joined, it was like June 1966 in Maricopa. Yeah. 
was starting to really become aware of Vietnam and

02:44.748 --> 02:48.973
where it was. What was your feeling towards 
America's involvement in Vietnam at the time?

02:55.840 --> 03:13.540
Well, I had a pretty clear idea that I thought that 
it was a legitimate involvement that, I guess, the

02:55.840 --> 03:13.540
duly constituted government of South Vietnam was 
being undermined, I guess, by revolutionaries

03:14.954 --> 03:43.088
and I guess insurgents from the North, and that 
they had a legitimate right to call upon powers

03:14.954 --> 03:43.088
that had similar ideas, I guess democratic 
principles, to come to their assistance and to

03:14.954 --> 03:43.088
keep them from being denied what at that time I 
considered to be their rightful and and

03:44.570 --> 03:51.200
justifiable

03:44.570 --> 03:51.200
political system. So I saw it as legitimate. Our 
involvement specifically in Vietnam is

03:55.407 --> 03:58.772
legitimate and just. And I continue, as a matter of 
fact, to hold that idea to this very day. Back to

04:05.282 --> 04:08.667
your initial joining of the military. You joined 
in, you said, June of 66. Right. What was it like for

04:12.768 --> 04:24.398
a high school kid, fresh out of wherever, to just 
join the military and know that, in all

04:12.768 --> 04:24.398
likelihood, he was going to get sent to fight? 
Well, to tell you the truth, I didn't. I never had

04:26.781 --> 04:32.226
the idea of, in all likelihood, I was going to be 
sent to fight.

04:35.308 --> 04:40.513
That's just sort of an overall, kind of an 
unfocused, impressionistic idea. you know,

04:40.814 --> 04:42.356
going in the military. Because again, I came from a 
fairly, I don't want to say disadvantaged

04:42.376 --> 05:02.766
background, but for guys in my social status, I 
guess, going into the Army was a typical thing

04:42.376 --> 05:02.766
that, you know, high school counselors for years 
and years had advised to people like myself and

04:42.376 --> 05:02.766
other, and my friends and things. So it was really 
like a lot of the wealthier kids or the upper class

05:02.786 --> 05:09.977
kids, it was expected that they would go on to 
college. it was more or less expected, you know,

05:10.463 --> 05:23.855
that the kids that didn't come from a wealthy 
background or hadn't majored in courses that

05:10.463 --> 05:23.855
would lead to a college education would either 
take some sort of a job or go into the military. So it

05:23.875 --> 05:33.924
was kind of like, it was almost sort of like I was 
just following a pattern that most people in my

05:23.875 --> 05:33.924
group followed. So it wasn't sort of like I, you 
know, I sat down and I consciously said, I'm going

05:38.071 --> 05:40.493
to go in the Army, you know, and I'm going to find 
out. It was just sort of like it was one of the

05:40.734 --> 05:54.327
options that I had open to myself, and my, you know, 
my uncles had done it, you know, and older kids in

05:40.734 --> 05:54.327
the neighborhood had done it, and they'd come back 
with their uniforms on and all that kind of stuff.

05:54.367 --> 06:07.200
So it was just sort of an expected or a potential or a 
historical option that kids from my part of the

05:54.367 --> 06:07.200
country and my, I guess, social and economic 
status took for themselves. You grew up in New

06:07.552 --> 06:08.853
Jersey? Yeah, right near New York, about 12 miles 
from New York City. Beautiful place. Sounds like

06:16.140 --> 06:17.181
it was. When you first joined, where were you sent? 
I was sent to Fort Dix, New Jersey, for basic

06:20.985 --> 06:24.008
training. First I went to Newark, New Jersey, 
where they swore me in, you know, and uphold the

06:24.868 --> 06:32.175
Constitution and stuff like that. But I remember 
the first thing that happened to me. After I was

06:35.378 --> 06:38.442
sworn into the Army, some guy started yelling at 
me. And I had to clean up. Clean up your own. Clean up

06:45.631 --> 06:47.894
the place where we had all been sworn in. The first 
thing they did was hand me a broom and said, clean up

06:48.314 --> 06:53.601
this place, private. I said, well, geez, I guess 
this is, I'm in the Army now. How did you get

06:59.168 --> 07:00.950
involved with the Special Forces? Well, like I 
said, I enlisted in the Army airborne on a sign. All

07:04.825 --> 07:07.249
that I knew is I wanted to jump out of airplanes. I 
saw these pictures of guys coming out of

07:07.770 --> 07:10.034
airplanes. I said, gee, that's hot stuff. So 
anyway, they assigned me to military police. And

07:14.522 --> 07:22.395
there was no way in the world, you know, a kid 
growing up in the streets of New Jersey, the last

07:14.522 --> 07:22.395
thing you want to be is a cop, right? But I think they 
figure, you know, that if you've been on the edge of

07:22.645 --> 07:30.732
crime all your life, you know, that you have some 
insight, you know, into the criminal mind. And

07:30.872 --> 07:38.319
plus I was big, you know, like six foot two or three 
and big, you know, and I liked all of the things. I

07:38.860 --> 07:50.290
think I was a little bit more intelligent than your 
average guy, but I liked the same kind of things

07:38.860 --> 07:50.290
that your average, I liked the outdoors, you know, 
and all that sort of stuff. But if you weren't real

07:50.911 --> 07:55.899
bright and you liked the outdoors and you liked to 
hunt and all that sort of stuff, they put you in the

07:50.911 --> 07:55.899
infantry. But if you're fairly smart, you know, 
and you like the outdoors and you like to hunt and

07:56.400 --> 08:02.070
all that stuff, they put you in the military 
police. But I didn't want to be in the military

08:02.550 --> 08:04.253
police. So after I finished basic training, I went 
to military police training in Fort Gordon,

08:06.838 --> 08:11.365
Georgia. And somewhere in As I was going through 
the training and I'm marching around going,

08:14.367 --> 08:21.657
M-I-L-I-T-A-R-Y-P-O-L-I-C-E,

08:14.367 --> 08:21.657
I'm going, I don't want to be this. I don't want to 
direct traffic or whatever you do. And I had this

08:26.763 --> 08:34.634
friend, this crazy friend that I met there who was 
going to go to jump school too. And one day he said,

08:34.674 --> 08:40.341
hey, there's this thing called special forces 
that that you can volunteer for and you can get out

08:40.793 --> 08:46.082
of the military police. And I had kind of a vague 
idea, I think, of what it was all about, but I didn't

08:46.102 --> 08:51.671
really have that clear of an idea. He said, it's a 
lot of fun. You still get to jump out of airplanes.

08:55.036 --> 08:59.063
You get to do all kinds of hiking around in the woods 
and all that sort of stuff. So me and two other guys

09:00.004 --> 09:07.797
one day went and took this test from a special 
forces recruiter. Or somebody, I'm not sure, I

09:08.553 --> 09:25.014
can't actually remember whether he was in Special 
Forces or not, but we took this test where we had to,

09:08.553 --> 09:25.014
oh, they gave us these hypothetical scenarios and 
you had to tell them what you'd do in those

09:08.553 --> 09:25.014
situations. One is if you got captured behind 
enemy lines and you had, you know, they gave you

09:25.134 --> 09:35.607
alternative ways of escaping, you know, which one 
would you choose, I guess. And then they had

09:36.110 --> 09:42.558
another one that had to do with reconnaissance, 
where they'd show you a picture, and then you'd

09:36.110 --> 09:42.558
have to look from a point of view. They'd give you 
points of view pictures, and you had to decide from

09:42.618 --> 09:48.987
what point of view that picture was taken. And I 
think they had something on foreign language, and

09:50.048 --> 09:55.295
then another thing that had to do with flying 
helicopters. I have no idea what that had to do with

09:55.335 --> 09:57.197
anything. But anyway, that's sort of how I came to 
volunteer.

10:05.017 --> 10:11.424
kind of an alternative to being in what I consider 
to be sort of a ridiculous job, you know, being a

10:05.017 --> 10:11.424
cop. Once you got into them, you didn't stay at Fort 
Dix, I'm sure. No, see, I went from Fort Dix, like I

10:16.889 --> 10:22.335
said, to Fort Gordon for military police 
training. Then I went from Fort Gordon to jump

10:22.895 --> 10:26.079
school at Fort Benning. And I didn't find out until 
I finished jump school at Fort Benning whether I

10:27.000 --> 10:32.205
was was accepted to go into Special Forces 
training. And it was the last day of jump school

10:36.523 --> 10:41.511
after we'd done all our jumping and had our wings 
and all that stuff. They gather everybody in a big

10:41.531 --> 10:43.374
crowd. And this sergeant stood up on a box and 
started reading off where everybody was going.

10:49.062 --> 10:54.070
And most of the guys were going to the 173rd 
Airborne in Vietnam right at that point. And I kept

10:55.052 --> 10:56.894
waiting for him to call my name. And then I called 
off about, I guess, 10 or 20 names. and said, oh, you

11:02.003 --> 11:05.648
were going to Fort Bragg, North Carolina for 
Special Forces training. And I thought, oh my God,

11:06.470 --> 11:09.654
you know, here we go. So I went from Fort Bending, 
Georgia to Fort Bragg, North Carolina for Special

11:09.795 --> 11:16.425
Forces training. Now, my dad was also in the 
Special Forces, and he was stationed in Fort

11:17.526 --> 11:21.452
Bragg. Was Fort Bragg more or less the 
headquarters for the Special Forces training?

11:25.799 --> 11:28.062
Special Forces training, and there were two 
Special Forces groups there, the Seventh Special

11:29.611 --> 11:46.494
Forces, I can't even remember, the Seventh and

11:29.611 --> 11:46.494
I don't know, the Third, I think, Third Special 
Forces. And then they had what they called Special

11:46.514 --> 11:58.791
Forces Training Group, which was, Special Forces 
was situated on what they called Smoke Bomb Hill at

11:46.514 --> 11:58.791
Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and we were down the 
road from the 82nd Airborne. which they called the

11:59.581 --> 12:04.489
animals or something like that. They were viewed 
as sort of criminals and swine, people who were

12:05.971 --> 12:12.721
sort of misfits and weirdos. 82nd Airborne, what 
did they call it? AA was their symbol. It stood for

12:18.810 --> 12:22.917
All-American, and I think we changed that into 
something like animals and assholes. But the

12:24.599 --> 12:26.382
worst thing that could happen would be to bomb out 
of Special Forces training and end up going to the

12:26.952 --> 12:30.616
82nd airport. I mean, that was like the worst 
possible thing that you could imagine. What did

12:34.501 --> 12:36.724
your training in Special Forces involve? What did 
they teach you? Well, the training I went through,

12:38.506 --> 12:45.114
it was called Tactics and Techniques, Phase I and 
Phase II. God, it's hard to remember. Phase I,

12:47.697 --> 12:53.905
Phase I we learned

12:56.804 --> 13:06.374
I think phase one involved learning our job 
specialty that we were going to have within

12:56.804 --> 13:06.374
Special Forces. Years was? I was a radio operator 
called O5B. My MOS in the Army was O5B4S. When we

13:16.865 --> 13:24.313
first got there, we went through some processing 
where we had pictures taken from passports and all

13:16.865 --> 13:24.313
kinds of crazy stuff. And then you just kind of went 
through a building and you, they didn't really

13:25.053 --> 13:50.416
tell you one way or the other, you know, what the 
difference, you knew that you could be, if you were

13:25.053 --> 13:50.416
E3 or E2 to E4, which is private to like a corporal, 
the options open to you were radio operator,

13:25.053 --> 13:50.416
engineer, and medic. And if you were like E5 and 
above, I think the options were all of those. Those

13:58.251 --> 14:07.925
three plus, you could get into weapons, 
demolition, what they called operations and

13:58.251 --> 14:07.925
intelligence, which was more or less spying. And I 
guess that was about it. So anyway, first part had

14:11.451 --> 14:14.976
to do with training in the job. I can't remember 
whether, though, in the first part there were some

14:16.478 --> 14:23.308
of the infantry tactics and guerrilla tactics. 
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right. Part of it, the first

14:25.025 --> 14:53.329
part, you went through your MOS training, which 
for me involved learning everything about

14:25.025 --> 14:53.329
radios, cutting antennas to frequency, learning 
Mars code, learning radio procedure, learning

14:25.025 --> 14:53.329
about all the different kinds of radios, to the 
point where I could supposedly be inserted

14:25.025 --> 14:53.329
anywhere in the universe and set up a radio and get 
in touch with someone thousands of miles away if we

14:25.025 --> 14:53.329
had to be resupplied or whatever. But the other 
part had to do with a very important part of the

14:53.950 --> 15:00.739
mission of Special Forces. Well, the overall 
mission of Special Forces is to train and equip the

15:02.221 --> 15:10.132
indigenous personnel in the art of guerrilla 
warfare. In Vietnam, the mission was to train and

15:10.733 --> 15:17.082
equip the indigenous personnel in the art of 
counterinsurgency. But this idea of training is a

15:17.803 --> 15:22.810
very important part of the mission of Special 
Forces. So we had a big unit as part of our training

15:23.195 --> 15:33.108
on teaching, where we learned about visual aids 
and how to give a speech and how to teach and how to

15:23.195 --> 15:33.108
test and all that sort of stuff. So as I recall, 
phase one involved learning our job

15:33.248 --> 15:44.983
specialization and also learning how to teach

15:33.248 --> 15:44.983
maybe some other stuff. I can't recall. And then 
that was tactics and techniques phase one. And

15:48.608 --> 15:52.813
then tactics and techniques phase two involved 
actual you know, learning about guerrilla

15:53.502 --> 16:21.045
warfare, how to conduct both insurgent and 
counterinsurgent, counterinsurgency

15:53.502 --> 16:21.045
operations,

15:53.502 --> 16:21.045
which involved, you know, setting up camps and, 
you know, all your basic infantry kinds of

15:53.502 --> 16:21.045
tactics, how to put together a mission, how to make 
what they called poncho parachutes, how to build

16:21.329 --> 16:26.216
landing zones, how to build drop zones so you could 
be resupplied from the air. In fact, one part of

16:27.719 --> 16:35.731
that training involved going out somewhere and 
building. I think the engineers built a runway,

16:38.074 --> 16:42.741
and then they had C-130s come and pick us up. And 
then the engineers had also built a drop zone, and

16:44.123 --> 16:49.691
then they dropped us in on the drop zone. And then 
the last part of the Phase two is where you got

16:51.400 --> 16:55.144
together in a team, a 12-man team. They put you in 
what they called kind of a safe house situation,

16:56.005 --> 17:00.971
where you're isolated from the world. You planned 
a mission that you were going to go on, and then you

17:01.271 --> 17:05.636
executed the mission. In our case, we got dropped 
into Pisgah, North Carolina National Forest at

17:06.277 --> 17:16.328
night in a soybean field, and we were picked up by 
indigenous people that's farmers and stuff and

17:16.595 --> 17:45.100
pick up trucks and they cover us over and drove us in 
the mountains and we conducted more or less a

17:16.595 --> 17:45.100
guerrilla campaign while at the same time being 
pursued by counter-insurgents pretty good

17:16.595 --> 17:45.100
training when you got out of uh your training what 
what happened then i was assigned to vietnam no i

17:16.595 --> 17:45.100
was assigned to the seventh special forces group 
company a I was there on what they called, I can't

17:45.755 --> 18:01.334
remember the actual name of it, but I was attached 
to a special project at that time that I'm not at

17:45.755 --> 18:01.334
liberty to discuss, even to this very day. Top 
secret. Well, I don't know, whatever you want to

18:02.956 --> 18:15.070
call it, but I was assigned to the special project 
for approximately

18:02.956 --> 18:15.070
seven months, and then after that I was... 
assigned to the Special Forces in Vietnam.

18:21.695 --> 18:25.880
When you got your orders to go overseas, what were 
your feelings? Were you scared? Well, I saw guys

18:28.003 --> 18:33.650
going all the time, you know, so I figured, well, 
sort of, yeah. At this point, I was kind of, you

18:33.670 --> 18:38.656
know, wary. I was thinking, oh, geez, you know, 
this is it. what we called at that time the Live Fire

18:41.797 --> 18:44.841
FTX. FTX stands for Field Training Exercise. 
Whenever everybody got their orders to go to

18:47.765 --> 18:52.432
Vietnam, they called it the Live Fire FTX. You were 
on your way to

18:52.492 --> 18:57.399
Vietnam. And there weren't a whole lot of guys at 
that time either that had, younger guys that had

18:57.419 --> 19:09.435
been to Vietnam and then come back and were 
reassigned to a stateside unit. But So, they

19:10.754 --> 19:14.178
didn't really have a lot of guys to talk to who had 
been there. The older NCOs had got some of them, and

19:15.020 --> 19:21.308
a lot of the older NCOs, as a matter of fact, went 
over there and stayed. I mean, a lot of them had been

19:21.888 --> 19:25.373
over there since the late 50s, you know. So, there 
wasn't a pool of guys, really, you know, that you

19:25.393 --> 19:31.661
could talk to and find out a whole lot about it from. 
So, yeah, I was worried, but I wasn't scared. I was

19:37.449 --> 19:38.550
just worried. you know, concerned, but I felt 
equipped. You know, I felt like I was really

19:42.387 --> 19:44.210
well-trained. Did you feel like one of the best and 
the brightest? Oh, yeah. I felt like I had had the

19:47.153 --> 19:52.400
best possible training, at least in the Army, you 
know, that you could get. And the kind of mission,

19:52.420 --> 19:59.889
you know, that I perceived of myself performing in 
Vietnam was precisely, you know, what I wanted to

19:52.420 --> 19:59.889
do. When

19:59.909 --> 20:07.558
you first got to Vietnam, What did you see? Let's 
see.

20:15.191 --> 20:17.735
I saw a Tan Sanute Air Force base. No, no, not Tan 
Sanute. Cameron Bay. Got off the plane and looked

20:21.279 --> 20:22.681
around. It looked like a giant prison camp. There 
was barbed wire all over the place. There was

20:27.006 --> 20:29.870
nobody wearing anything but military uniforms.

20:32.333 --> 20:35.537
They rushed us off the plane, jumped onto a bus, 
took us somewhere, immediately separated the

20:36.766 --> 20:42.954
Special Forces guys out, put everybody else in a 
big lump. And then they had,

20:44.897 --> 20:55.731
for the officers, for the Special Forces 
officers, they had helicopters, came and picked

20:44.897 --> 20:55.731
them up and took them off to Natrang. And then the 
enlisted guys, they gave us all M-16s, put us on

20:55.751 --> 21:06.064
trucks, and drove us to Natrang from Cam Ranh Bay. 
Where is that train? I guess it's about 125 miles

21:08.535 --> 21:12.680
north of Cam Ranh Bay.

21:16.844 --> 21:17.725
That was strange. I mean, we rode down these roads 
at, you know, 60 miles an hour, and the Montagnards

21:18.827 --> 21:29.619
were driving the trucks, these wild ass, you know, 
little people from the mountains. And we just went

21:30.760 --> 21:35.005
roar assing through all these little villages. 
locked and loaded. I'll never forget when I

21:38.890 --> 21:42.535
finally got to the train, my ass hurt so bad. I 
couldn't sit down. I couldn't sit down for a week.

21:48.363 --> 21:50.385
But that was my initial experience, right? You 
know, here's a gun, go to the train. You

21:54.050 --> 22:02.562
set up as a radio operator there, right? You were in 
charge of more or less the communications

22:03.217 --> 22:06.762
organization period. What they call first 
echelon maintenance and, you know, teaching the

22:06.782 --> 22:19.862
people that we worked with, you know, appropriate 
radio procedure and that sort of stuff. Did you

22:22.246 --> 22:26.592
have a lot of Vietnamese help with your 
operations? Not really, no. Vietnamese

22:29.643 --> 22:31.365
counterparts. See, at that time, there was some 
controversy. They had the

22:33.447 --> 22:40.414
Mike Force, which was what I was in. We had 
Montagnard mercenaries, more or less. These guys

22:44.918 --> 22:45.799
were paid. They weren't a part of the, we were 
attached to the Vietnamese Army. We weren't a part

22:49.963 --> 22:52.485
of the United States Army when we were there. So all 
our equipment came through the Vietnamese Army.

22:55.613 --> 22:59.279
But we were supposed to have what they call 
Vietnamese counterparts. And at this time, there

22:59.299 --> 23:15.844
was sort of like an internal rebellion among the 
Montagnards, and they all threatened to quit and

22:59.299 --> 23:15.844
go back to Bamituot, where most of them came from, 
or at least the ones that we had. And there had been

23:17.046 --> 23:22.414
some rebellions at some of the egg camps. they had 
one of the camps they had held, you know, taking the

23:23.322 --> 23:36.301
Vietnamese and strung them up from the, you know, 
the flag poles, and it held the Americans not

23:23.322 --> 23:36.301
really hostage. But anyway, the Moniards hated 
all Vietnamese. So at the time when I got there,

23:39.666 --> 23:47.197
they had sort of shuffled the Vietnamese off to 
Buffalo for a while, you know, until things cooled

23:39.666 --> 23:47.197
down. But the Moniards just created a ruckus. We 
were in bad shape for a while because half of them

23:51.942 --> 24:00.251
just said, screw you, you know, and took their 
portable radios and headed back to the mountains.

24:00.271 --> 24:01.492
Back to the mountains. Yeah. You had problems with 
the mountain yards, and from what we've been

24:03.214 --> 24:19.112
studying in history, it seems like a lot of times 
U.S. troops didn't know exactly who to fight, but

24:03.214 --> 24:19.112
with the Viet Cong in the south and the Viet Minh in 
the north. Did you ever get that feeling of who are

24:21.625 --> 24:23.247
we here against? Well, only with reference to the 
Vietnamese, you know. The Montagnards were

24:27.272 --> 24:48.257
pretty, they, like I said, they hated all 
Vietnamese, and they were perfect, you know,

24:27.272 --> 24:48.257
perfect allies, and the Vietnamese hated the 
Cambodians, you know, so, so we had Special Forces

24:27.272 --> 24:48.257
basically had Cambodian strike force teams, 
Cambodian mercenaries and Montagnard

24:27.272 --> 24:48.257
mercenaries, the idea being that these guys hated 
Vietnamese, and they didn't give a damn whether

24:48.659 --> 24:57.229
they were Viet Cong, North Vietnamese, South 
Vietnamese, or anything. They hated Vietnamese.

24:58.770 --> 25:08.501
So,

24:58.770 --> 25:08.501
with reference to the people that we worked most 
closely with, nah, not really. But see, there was,

25:09.783 --> 25:12.766
it was just pretty strange. I mean, yeah, I mean, 
when you go into a village or ride by people or

25:14.714 --> 25:23.203
whatever, you never know what the hell their 
proclivities were. So, you know, it kind of, you

25:24.724 --> 25:27.647
never know. That's it. Bottom line. Nobody. 
Nobody Vietnamese. But the Montagnards are

25:32.512 --> 25:37.197
pretty trustworthy little guys, I think. And I 
think they're probably still fighting to this

25:37.817 --> 25:42.662
very day. I wouldn't doubt it one bit. People tend 
to fight a long time if they want something that

25:46.551 --> 25:50.235
bad. On a geographic level, what was Vietnam like? 
I've heard it was all jungle, mountainous. See, I

25:59.825 --> 26:02.108
spent most of my time out in the terrain. And

26:02.548 --> 26:09.335
we traveled around a lot as part of what we had to do. 
But where I was, it was a lot like Southern

26:09.436 --> 26:13.560
California. I mean, what blew me away, well, I came 
back from Vietnam one time on an emergency leave to

26:14.671 --> 26:23.242
escort a body back, and I landed. I'd never been to 
California before. I think it was Travis Air Force

26:24.844 --> 26:28.990
Base in California that we landed at. I'm not sure, 
though. But I got off the plane. I looked around. I

26:32.014 --> 26:33.536
said, God damn. This looks exactly like where I am. 
This is all flying and leaving from this place.

26:37.661 --> 26:37.902
Right. So we were on the beach. I mean, it was 
beautiful. Sandy beaches. You looked out from

26:43.358 --> 26:45.321
where we were. Our little detachment was right on 
the edge of what they called the SFOP, which is the

26:45.781 --> 26:53.211
Special Forces Operational Base. It's like the 
main home base for Special Forces. And we were out

26:57.537 --> 26:58.558
on one edge. And you could look out. There's a big 
open field and a beautiful mountain, just like you

27:00.281 --> 27:12.657
see in California, where if you're on the coast and 
you see the ocean, and you look over your shoulder,

27:00.281 --> 27:12.657
there's the mountains. You couldn't see the ocean 
exactly from where we were, but it was a lot like

27:13.463 --> 27:21.374
California, you know. That's interesting. Yeah. 
Had a rainy season like you have in California.

27:27.964 --> 27:34.774
What, aside from military activities, went on in 
Vietnam? For me, basically drinking and whoring,

27:34.914 --> 27:40.502
I guess you'd say. I mean, extracurricular 
activities. But everybody had their own quirks,

27:43.771 --> 27:46.073
you know. I mean, there were religious guys right 
alongside of the, you know, the profane,

27:46.453 --> 27:52.139
sinful-type guys. Whenever we had spare time, we 
would either go into the trang itself, or if we were

27:53.960 --> 28:10.656
on a long stand-down, I'd go travel, see my 
buddies, you know, at other camps, especially up

27:53.960 --> 28:10.656
at Pleiku, where I had a really, really close 
friend. In the movies, you see all this drug abuse

28:12.087 --> 28:21.142
going on in the military in Vietnam, the troops 
walking through the swamp smoking a joint. I don't

28:22.684 --> 28:26.551
put much stock in that, but mainly because it's 
Hollywood. But was drug abuse, right in the middle

28:27.152 --> 28:34.444
of the 60s, drugs were starting to be the end thing. 
Was drug abuse very prevalent in the military in

28:35.025 --> 28:38.871
Vietnam? From my experience, toward the end of my 
stay there, the guys that started coming in from

28:39.998 --> 28:55.278
the States were using marijuana, you know, like 
into marijuana, you know. And on a couple of

28:56.340 --> 29:00.265
occasions, I got hooked up with some real loony 
bins guys. And I remember one time going to an opium

29:00.485 --> 29:02.448
den. I didn't smoke any opium. I was just shocked. I 
mean, here I was, you know, roasting 12 Special

29:05.612 --> 29:09.938
Forces, but I never thought that there was such a 
thing in the world as these places where people

29:10.525 --> 29:20.017
laid on wooden beds and huffed on opium. I 
remember, too, when I was there, I went in and

29:21.358 --> 29:26.084
looked around and said, this is fucking crazy. I 
don't have anything to do with this. So I sat out in

29:28.908 --> 29:33.493
the waiting room with the woman that was running 
the place. And while I was there, what amounted to

29:33.554 --> 29:38.760
the Vietnamese pusher man came around And I'll 
never forget, man, he had this big black

29:39.179 --> 29:43.025
briefcase, right? And he dumped it out on the 
floor, and it was just all, like, already rolled

29:43.425 --> 29:50.315
marijuana cigarettes. And he and this woman 
haggled over these things for about 20 minutes

29:50.916 --> 29:57.626
while I was sitting there drinking, you know, and 
watching them. It was weird. And then when this one

29:59.629 --> 30:05.878
guy, these guys that I was with, whose names I'll 
never remember, uh, When they went back out onto

30:07.124 --> 30:17.199
the street, man, everybody that saw them, all the 
Vietnamese that saw them were going, you know,

30:07.124 --> 30:17.199
they could tell, look at these guys, and they were 
just bongo. But most of the guys that I knew, there

30:18.942 --> 30:33.283
was kind of like a, see, Special Forces, you know, 
it wasn't really, I mean, everybody in Special

30:18.942 --> 30:33.283
Forces wasn't Special Forces trained, and there 
were all sorts of what you would call sort of

30:18.942 --> 30:33.283
support personnel who were, who didn't have the 
same ideals, you know, and ambitions of the guys

30:33.955 --> 30:39.602
that had actually gone through the training. And 
you'd meet some of these guys in the train, you

30:40.944 --> 30:55.142
know, who were in headquarters company, and these 
guys were the ones that were sort of like, you know,

30:40.944 --> 30:55.142
not up to standards, I guess you might say, or up to 
speed. There were a lot of guys wearing berets over

30:56.503 --> 31:02.511
there that didn't even have, had never been to 
airborne school or anything. were assigned to

31:02.930 --> 31:05.794
special forces, you know, cooks, you name it. So 
that's one thing a lot of people don't realize when

31:06.234 --> 31:13.503
they look, you know, think about special forces. 
There were guys over there that were involved in

31:14.965 --> 31:17.869
intelligence work and things. I never realized 
that there were so many people that weren't

31:18.710 --> 31:23.276
trained in special forces. Oh, yeah. Yeah, and at 
the time I was there, they were hurting for people,

31:23.576 --> 31:30.625
so they would take guys from, you know, like the 
101st Airborne See, once you got there, and if you

31:31.735 --> 31:36.099
had some combat experience, you could volunteer 
to go into Special Forces. So we had a lot of guys

31:36.960 --> 31:38.501
that would come in. Not a lot, but a few, who had been 
in the 101st, and maybe had decided to stay in

31:39.562 --> 31:47.329
Vietnam for an extra year. And part of the 
condition of the re-enlistment was to get into

31:47.830 --> 31:51.573
Special Forces. Because actually, Special 
Forces duty was pretty good stuff. At least it was

31:56.498 --> 32:01.422
for me.

32:02.009 --> 32:31.780
this all this drug questions i asked or leading to 
one point

32:02.009 --> 32:31.780
to me the other day or a couple of months ago she said 
that she thought that one of the reasons for our i

32:02.009 --> 32:31.780
guess you could say failure to win the war in 
vietnam was because a lot of people were coming out

32:02.009 --> 32:31.780
of high school and not having the opportunity to go 
to college like yourself and that a lot of them were

32:32.047 --> 32:36.392
not the caliber of men we would want serving our 
country. Would you buy that argument at all? Well,

32:42.158 --> 32:44.180
I don't know. Most of the guys that I spent any time 
with were excellent human beings, some of the best

32:46.583 --> 32:54.932
people that I have or ever will.
