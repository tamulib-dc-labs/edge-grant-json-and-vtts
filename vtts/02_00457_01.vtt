WEBVTT

00:04.908 --> 00:17.346
I am with Mr. Roy Bliler, class of 1950. My name is 
John Hatch. I'm a member of Dr. Anderson's History

00:19.349 --> 00:26.318
347 class.

00:27.720 --> 00:33.348
Mr. Bliler, I think if we could start off with, I'm 
going to ask you some questions. It should be able

00:33.449 --> 00:34.510
to pick you up. Could you please state your name and 
your rank when you first entered the Army Air

00:36.599 --> 00:41.364
Corps? Well, I went, to give you a little 
background, I was a National Guardsman. And I went

00:49.631 --> 00:59.921
with the 200 and, hell, I can't remember the number 
of it now, but it was a post artillery antiaircraft

00:49.631 --> 00:59.921
in 1941 as a sergeant. And then on January, on New 
Year's Eve day, I got orders to report to the Air

01:06.704 --> 01:11.750
Force at Williams Air Force Base. I had applied for 
transfer to the Air Force at that time. So it was

01:16.516 --> 01:24.666
January 1st, 1941, and I was a buck sergeant. What 
was your full name? Roy Casson Lyler.

01:29.552 --> 01:32.475
K-A-S-S-O-N. All right. And what was your rank 
again? You were a? Sergeant, grade four. Okay.

01:40.394 --> 01:41.235
Okay. And then what was your rank when you finally 
retired? First lieutenant. First lieutenant.

01:48.241 --> 01:48.782
Okay. Now, how old were you when you were first 
commissioned? And how did you go, where did you go

01:51.204 --> 01:54.227
for your commissioning? Well, I was commissioned 
in the Air Force as a bombardier. And it was the 19th

02:00.772 --> 02:04.876
day of December, 1941. I was commissioned. Did I 
answer your question? Yes. All right. Okay.

02:15.565 --> 02:18.908
Again, how old were you at this time? 1919 to 1941. I 
was 22. Okay, 22. And now, in reference, how old

02:25.074 --> 02:29.378
were some of the men that you served with at the 
time? Well, they ran from, I think the youngest was

02:30.185 --> 02:33.709
19. They were commissioning them at 18 in those 
days, but most of them who were second lieutenants

02:33.729 --> 02:42.900
were 19 to 25. And how about some of the enlisted? 
What were their age groups? You know, I can't

02:49.288 --> 02:51.130
really honestly tell you. They were young. 
Probably 20 to 25. Okay. Now, Do you, for all you

03:00.965 --> 03:08.132
know, are you the last Aggie survivor of the 
Aleutians? I don't know. I haven't had contact

03:09.994 --> 03:13.818
with any of them for years. I don't know. I just 
don't know. I would hope that this could put me in

03:16.040 --> 03:19.824
touch with some of them. Okay. Now, you mentioned 
that you did not attend Texas A&M at first. You came

03:26.491 --> 03:28.412
back after the war. No. Okay. Could you explain 
that just a little bit? Well, I went to a little old

03:31.492 --> 03:39.264
teacher's college in Minnesota in 1940, 41, 39, 
40. And I was, it was, there was nothing to study for

03:39.585 --> 03:54.068
but to be a teacher, and I wanted to be an engineer, 
but that was hopeless at the time because I

03:39.585 --> 03:54.068
couldn't afford it. I lived at home and went to 
school. What was the question again? I came to the

03:58.935 --> 04:09.813
U.N. right after the war in 1945, and enrolled as a 
chemical engineer. And some of those credits

04:09.833 --> 04:11.796
counted. I got about a year's credit. I had two 
years of college. I got about a year's credit out of

04:15.302 --> 04:19.629
that teacher's college for my degree. Okay. Now, 
would you state, basically in your own words, what

04:23.112 --> 04:33.006
the United States military's purpose was in the 
Aleutian Island campaign? Well, it was to drive

04:33.026 --> 04:36.131
the Japanese out of the Aleutian Islands. You see, 
the Aleutian Islands were owned by the United

04:36.151 --> 04:40.717
States. They were purchased in the original 
Seward purchase years ago. And the Japanese

04:46.566 --> 04:52.174
invaded the Aleutian Islands, and they invaded 
two islands. And our objective was to get them the

04:53.048 --> 05:02.441
hell out of there before they came on down the west 
coast. They were a little afraid that they would

05:02.461 --> 05:06.326
come down the west coast. It turned out later they 
had no intention of it. It was diversionary, but we

05:08.629 --> 05:13.195
didn't know that at the time. I guess that answers 
your question. We wanted to get them the hell out of

05:15.077 --> 05:16.339
there. All right. Could you kind of explain where 
the Aleutian Islands are located? You mentioned

05:22.090 --> 05:24.893
it's on the west coast. Well, it's off the west 
coast of Alaska.

05:37.927 --> 05:38.027
Matt? Be prepared,

05:38.047 --> 05:43.733
my buddy. This is Alaska. Here we are. All right. 
Now they start here and then they come on. They

05:47.773 --> 05:48.915
string on out. Yes, sir. Into the Bering Sea. Okay. 
And that's colder than hell up there. The water's

05:55.765 --> 05:58.109
cold, even in the summertime. But these are the 
islands, and I was on

05:59.150 --> 06:08.064
Jetson-Kiscon Attitudes up here. And I ended up on 
this island right here. If she was out, okay.

06:20.956 --> 06:25.862
Ms. Andrea Hollins was a part of the chain, the 
illusion chain. Jessica and Chick Holland, that

06:27.024 --> 06:33.493
right there, that's the one I ended up on. I made a 
few raids out of Adak Holland, but that was too far

06:33.613 --> 06:38.159
back. So we moved up to Farming. They put up landing 
strip on Amchitka Island. And we loaded onto

06:48.405 --> 06:49.466
there. And we went there. They told us, it's in the 
book, by the way, they told us that we would be just

06:51.008 --> 06:58.278
an overnight stay. We went from this island here to 
go out and raid Kiska. And we would have come back

07:05.048 --> 07:07.591
and land and spend the night there. There was no 
runway there. They told us it would be just

07:09.534 --> 07:12.338
overnight, and we spent three months there. Okay. 
They lied to us. They didn't want to get us in

07:16.118 --> 07:18.741
trouble. They, you mean the brass? Yeah. I was in 
the B-25, which was a twin-engine bomber. It was

07:28.214 --> 07:36.946
called, nicknamed the Billy Mitchell, because 
Billy Mitchell was a famous general in the World

07:28.214 --> 07:36.946
Air Force before the war. He died before the war, I 
think. But he had a big hand in the development of

07:39.723 --> 07:43.128
the B-25. Wonderful airplane. Brought me back 
many times. Can you kind of go into more detail

07:51.380 --> 07:55.867
about your mission and your responsibility? You 
said you were a bombardier. Bombardier. I dropped

07:58.290 --> 08:00.013
bombs from up there. Hell from heaven boys, they 
called us. And we never hit anything, it seemed

08:03.177 --> 08:05.781
like. We used to come down and the colonel would get 
us together and he'd cheer out the bombardier

08:06.335 --> 08:14.125
because he was partial to the pilots. And one of the 
bombardiers told him, he said, well, colonel, how

08:14.145 --> 08:22.456
can we hit anything if we don't have a stable 
platform? He says, the pilots keep moving on. He

08:24.478 --> 08:29.625
says, that's your problem.

08:30.078 --> 08:38.368
In reading the article, one thing that interested 
me was the, you mentioned something about not all

08:30.078 --> 08:38.368
the planes hit the site, the bombardier site. 
Yeah. Could you kind of explain the site? Well,

08:41.752 --> 08:57.030
usually they'd have a lead plane go up, and he'd 
drop bombs, and he'd drop them just a little bit

08:41.752 --> 08:57.030
short of the turret so that the planes that were 
with him, you know, in formation, their bombs

08:41.752 --> 08:57.030
would go off and hit the turret. Once in a while, we 
hit it lucky.

09:05.406 --> 09:09.892
We just had too much unstable weather and too many 
unstable pilots. Of course, if I'd have been a

09:09.912 --> 09:13.678
pilot, I'd have probably been unstable, too. How 
often did you go on combat missions? I think I'm

09:19.185 --> 09:26.916
listed 23 missions.

09:31.165 --> 09:34.689
23 of them, I think. Now, that's official 
missions. Now, those that we avoided, you know,

09:36.090 --> 09:49.565
you'd get up and then you'd run into some weather 
and you couldn't get there and you'd wander around

09:36.090 --> 09:49.565
and hope to hell you'd find the island again, come 
back and land. That wasn't a mission because you

09:49.585 --> 09:54.130
didn't drop your bombs. Okay. So how did that work 
out for a week, basically? 23 missions in six

09:59.295 --> 10:01.037
months. So, in other words, you didn't see active 
combat every day, I guess? Oh, no. No. A lot of

10:09.692 --> 10:13.978
active weather, but not a lot of active combat. 
Speaking of weather, I noticed in your article you

10:13.998 --> 10:20.446
mentioned something about some very powerful 
windstorms. What are they called? Could you

10:22.548 --> 10:24.871
explain that a little bit? Well, it was a freak wind 
that happened all the time up there. But it would

10:31.477 --> 10:36.662
come up, we'd get up in the morning and we'd have a 
still ocean. It was just perfectly calm. And all of

10:38.364 --> 10:42.548
a sudden the clouds would just come from nowhere. 
And then the wind would start to blow. And the

10:45.831 --> 10:49.155
worldwide wind would get up as much as 300 miles an 
hour. And it blew a lot of the boys out to sea and they

10:49.995 --> 10:58.564
never recovered because the planes would only go 
200 miles an hour. If they turned into this wind and

10:59.438 --> 11:04.663
tried to get back, they flew backwards. Now, I 
didn't put that in there. I sure didn't, I guess.

11:08.747 --> 11:10.469
That's one of the things I didn't mention. Well, 
how did they keep everything tied down in those

11:11.049 --> 11:13.912
kind of winds? Well, they had what they called 
revetments. They'd come in with a bulldozer, and

11:17.816 --> 11:23.461
that shell was kind of peculiar. They'd have some 
gravel sometimes, and they'd find that, and

11:23.501 --> 11:28.146
they'd build revetments. which would be a good 
open space with a wall. And they'd put the planes in

11:35.959 --> 11:42.946
there, taxi them in there, and we walk them in, and 
then tie them down. And then if the wind hit, it

11:42.966 --> 11:51.394
would flop them around, but it wouldn't blow them 
away because they were tied down. Okay. Now how

11:52.475 --> 11:55.078
about, okay. It's back to your combinations. Were 
you ever wounded in any of the times that you were?

12:02.113 --> 12:06.358
One time, and I mentioned it in there, I don't know 
whether they called it a wound or not. The flight

12:06.378 --> 12:08.340
surgeon didn't call it a wound. The windshield, 
something hit the windshield and shattered it,

12:09.521 --> 12:15.427
and a piece of glass, I think, hit my finger. I still 
got my scar from it. It wasn't much of a wound, but

12:18.390 --> 12:22.714
it, well, here it is. But it bled like a stud hog. It 
just bled all over the place. But I went back to him.

12:29.660 --> 12:32.725
We landed, and I went to the flight surgeon. He put 
some alcohol on it, and he said, hell, you're not

12:32.745 --> 12:36.591
hurt, boy. There's blood all over you. Well, 
where'd all that blood come from? He said, well, I

12:40.216 --> 12:42.059
don't know, but you're not hurt. Back to duty. I 
said, well, don't I at least get a purple heart? No.

12:48.469 --> 12:49.390
I don't know what hit me. I think a piece of 
plexiglass. A shell went through the windshield,

12:52.355 --> 12:55.339
a piece of plexiglass.

12:58.340 --> 13:00.882
I know in the story you explained it. Explain where 
your place in the plane is, I think. No, right up

13:06.888 --> 13:08.690
front, no. Underneath. Well, it's kind of, yeah, I 
guess you went underneath to get there, but it was

13:10.131 --> 13:18.979
up front. You could look back and see the pilot. 
Okay. You could look down and see you. But, yeah, it

13:25.285 --> 13:28.228
was in the nose. And incidentally, I mentioned in 
there, we had to land and take off in the nose in the

13:29.356 --> 13:40.013
most dangerous place of the airplane. Because if 
you crashed, whatever she would, we had to because

13:40.033 --> 13:53.674
the pilot, depending on the bombardier for his 
eyes, you couldn't see much below you because of

13:40.033 --> 13:53.674
the fog. The bombardier could see a little bit. And 
I explained in there how We'd come to an island.

13:59.909 --> 14:09.782
They'd pick out an island with a radar to find it, 
and then they'd fly along the coast until a

13:59.909 --> 14:09.782
bombardier spotted some barrels. The Air Force 
had put out floating barrels, anchor barrels. And

14:16.210 --> 14:24.601
then the bombardier would call upon John, we're 
here, and so he'd make a 270-degree turn and come in

14:16.210 --> 14:24.601
over those barrels. Well, the runway was 50 feet 
above the ocean. So he had to raise it 50 feet. And

14:31.430 --> 14:35.655
then you couldn't see the runway until you got 
right on it. And the bomber would tell him whether

14:35.675 --> 14:40.360
he was on the runway or not, knew it. And then he 
would drop down, and then the pilot couldn't see

14:40.380 --> 14:45.106
the runway. It was scary as hell. How often did you 
receive R&R? I never got it. I was offered it one

14:54.397 --> 14:56.739
time, and I turned it down. And don't ask me why. I 
think, looking back, I think I was afraid that if I

14:58.810 --> 15:05.561
went for a while or not, I'd be afraid to come back. I 
think that was the thinking. But, well, all of

15:08.966 --> 15:13.213
them, I guess, except me, went back. They called me 
a dumbass. But some of them went back, and they

15:16.117 --> 15:19.503
cracked up. They couldn't take it.

15:26.536 --> 15:32.884
What did you do to occupy your time when you weren't 
flying? Played a lot of poker in the bridge. Drank a

15:37.049 --> 15:40.073
lot of torpedo juice when we could get it. Which is? 
Well, torpedo juice is, I mentioned it in there,

15:41.615 --> 15:49.284
it's medical alcohol. The flight surgeon had 
strict control of it. He would give the pilot a Coke

15:52.488 --> 15:54.771
bottle full of it. Ron?

15:58.271 --> 15:58.651
Yeah? Excuse me, we're at my dad's while we're 
here. Do you want to come in and meet Mr. Hatch? What

16:11.266 --> 16:12.768
do you want? We were talking about your honor, what 
you did, Dr., by your time, whenever. Well, drank a

16:16.593 --> 16:18.094
lot of that. Well, we'd take the flight surgeon and 
we'd give a Coke bottle full to the pilot. There

16:25.177 --> 16:27.839
were seven men on the crew. Six or seven.

16:31.143 --> 16:31.343
Ten. And the pilot would take it back to the Quonset 
head, or the tent, if we were in tents. And he would

16:39.590 --> 16:41.973
cut it in half with water. And then he'd take that, 
he'd mix that, and then he'd cut that in half with

16:43.494 --> 16:49.159
grapefruit juice. We had plenty of grapefruit 
juice for some reason. Not much else, but

16:51.882 --> 16:53.023
grapefruit juice. And then he was divided up in the 
canteen cups among all the crew members. We each

16:59.455 --> 17:03.920
got mugged about a swallow, which he'd get drunk or 
held. Well,

17:04.941 --> 17:18.457
how well were the troops supplied as far as 
equipment?

17:18.477 --> 17:22.302
Well, another anecdote. He had a buddy who got shot 
down. Fortunately, he was rescued. But somehow or

17:27.319 --> 17:33.806
another, for some reason, he wore my hard hat, my 
helmet, out there. And he lost it in the drink. He

17:35.587 --> 17:37.309
came back and I said, where's my helmet? He says, 
hell, I lost it in the drink. So I went to the supply

17:42.013 --> 17:43.295
officer. I said, hey, I need a helmet. He says, god 
damn. He says, why didn't you lose an airplane

17:46.998 --> 17:48.880
helmet? We can supply an airplane like that, but we 
can't help it. Okay. So the supply wasn't too good.

17:58.174 --> 18:03.601
You mentioned we were like a living condition on 
the different islands. I know you mentioned you

18:03.621 --> 18:06.565
had different conditions. Well, Amchitka wasn't 
so good until toward the last. Amchitka was a

18:11.331 --> 18:15.437
burning outpost. And the warlock came and blew our 
tents away, blew everything away. like to drown

18:19.454 --> 18:21.716
us. And that's when somebody got wind of it and sent 
in some people from the attitude in general. So

18:33.088 --> 18:34.130
plenty of them. Can you imagine that? And they came 
in and landed after that one o'clock and looked

18:35.791 --> 18:40.096
into our condition. And they said, hell, this is 
terrible. He says, you're going to go back for,

18:43.299 --> 18:46.723
they didn't call it R&R. They called it, I don't 
know, rest, I guess. You're going to go back and get

18:51.960 --> 18:53.762
some rest. If we could rest before you come back. 
So, all the guys there wanted to go, except me. And I

19:02.175 --> 19:04.618
said, no, I don't think I'll go. I think I'll stay 
here and just straighten out. They brought some

19:08.043 --> 19:12.109
onset heads, and I had to help set it up. I didn't 
have to, but I did. Because I was afraid. I never did

19:15.414 --> 19:18.218
tell anybody this. So I have to do this, do this. I 
was brutally terrified that I would not come back.

19:26.695 --> 19:29.200
I was afraid they'd get me for desertion. Because I 
was just, I was exhausted by that time. I'd had too

19:33.226 --> 19:34.428
much combat. In fact, the adjutant told me 
finally, he says, you've had too damn much combat.

19:40.299 --> 19:43.764
He says, you realize you've been here longer than 
anybody? I said, no way.

19:47.812 --> 19:48.152
Okay. Well, how long were you there from when you 
originally were stationed until they finally

19:48.493 --> 19:56.304
sent you home? Let me see. Turn that off for a

19:57.366 --> 20:12.087
minute. I want to send that. Now, that was as 
interesting as it was there. Where was my

20:14.250 --> 20:16.553
permission?

22:45.877 --> 22:48.139
That's what I mentioned. I fell over dead in the 
air. Sixty-four of the men who had been in class

22:50.922 --> 22:57.249
number 4217, on December 20, 1942. That's when I 
got my commission. What was the question? How long

23:03.396 --> 23:09.943
did you serve from when you first were stationed in 
the Aleutians to when you finally went home?

23:28.958 --> 23:29.479
Let's see. We departed from there, from Seattle, 
on 26th of February, 43, via C-47 headed north. So

23:41.316 --> 23:45.582
that's when I first went to Volusia Island. 26th of 
February, 43. I came home.

24:16.107 --> 24:20.853
17th of September, 1943. We're not here the first 
day. February. February. March, April, May,

24:25.798 --> 24:31.285
June, July, August, September, seven months. And 
about six of those were in the islands.

24:41.577 --> 24:42.338
Okay. Was that an unusually long tour, or was that 
a... a fairly rather normal turnover rate?

24:53.777 --> 25:00.564
Well, nobody lasted much more than six months. A 
lot of guys went crazy. So that was an average tour,

25:03.847 --> 25:12.376
I would say, six months, seven months. Okay. A lot 
of guys, I got an ear infection out there. I don't

25:15.220 --> 25:16.942
know what it was. They called it the Emotion Crud. 
And they put me in a hospital in Wichita Falls, an

25:18.665 --> 25:23.632
Air Force hospital. And for some reason, they put 
me in psychiatric. No, no, no. And I got into this

25:30.822 --> 25:36.269
snake pit with a bunch of guys. And I asked them, 
well, that chicken, emotions, they're all lost to

25:36.289 --> 25:43.319
mine. So I went and told the surgeon. He said, no, 
you're not. He said, we'll get you out of there. I

25:52.363 --> 25:54.586
spent a day with him. But they had me under 
psychiatric treatment because they didn't know

25:54.606 --> 26:00.395
what this outbreak was in my ears. They thought it 
might be psychiatric. Turned out it wasn't. They

26:06.103 --> 26:08.667
called it dilution of crud. Pure, simple cure, 
just plain alcohol will chase it away. But it It's

26:14.300 --> 26:18.445
not permanent.

26:18.465 --> 26:20.127
I have to treat them every now and still. It was a 
bonus. So they flew you back from the Aleutians to

26:21.349 --> 26:25.214
Wichita Falls to treat them? No, they flew me back 
to Seattle. Oh, and this was at the end of your tour?

26:32.183 --> 26:33.965
Yes, at the end of my tour. No, it was a couple years 
later that I went to Wichita Falls. Oh, okay. Let me

26:40.934 --> 26:41.154
see. I don't know what I mean.

26:45.704 --> 26:51.573
You know, Colonel Roosevelt was on that plane with 
me.

26:51.593 --> 26:54.978
Yes.

26:54.998 --> 27:04.852
And I asked him, I said, Colonel, I said, did he 
think that he or I would get bumped in case anyone

26:54.998 --> 27:04.852
got on with their priority? And he said, maybe 
we'll find out. In El Paso, Texas, we found out, but

27:08.578 --> 27:12.724
I didn't mind really. I was on my way home, and this 
time my parachute was packed safely into the bus

27:13.193 --> 27:21.665
luggage. I didn't mind at all. Now, what happened 
was, you know, my parachute, God, that was my life.

27:29.495 --> 27:32.519
It took it everywhere with me. And so whenever we 
went on transport, I put it through on the

27:32.539 --> 27:40.410
transport. I had it ready to wear. But when we got to 
Seattle and got on the civilian plane, American

27:42.623 --> 27:58.939
Airways, I was carrying my parachute on board and 
the steward, they didn't have stewards, the

27:42.623 --> 27:58.939
steward says, I'll hire a lieutenant, you don't 
take that with you. And I said, what's he mean by

27:58.959 --> 28:01.341
that? He says, there's no opportunity to use it 
here. He says, look at all these civilians. He

28:05.165 --> 28:07.648
says, they don't have parachutes. So I had to... 
But there was luggage and that scared

28:08.408 --> 28:14.834
the hell out of me. I didn't have my parachutes. So I 
felt good about it when I finally got on that bus and

28:15.674 --> 28:21.800
it was back to where I was. Okay. How effective was 
the information coordination between the

28:24.442 --> 28:30.508
branches of the military? Oh, it was terrible. 
Terrible. Of course, a lot of it we didn't see. But

28:38.581 --> 28:44.068
the colonel used to say, I wish to God you guys would 
quit bitching about the Navy. He says, after all,

28:44.088 --> 28:46.431
they are our allies.

28:49.775 --> 28:54.641
No, that coordination was not good at all. We'd go 
out on a raid. Of course, the first thing that went

28:57.745 --> 29:02.712
out was the radio. Every time we'd go on a raid, the 
radio would get so full of static. I guess it was

29:05.295 --> 29:08.419
jam, I don't know, 20 or so or less static. But you 
couldn't hear much. We just

29:12.213 --> 29:17.662
took the headset off. No, the coordination was not 
good at all. I remember one time they were

29:21.028 --> 29:27.279
experimenting with radar up there. They were 
going to make a raid on Kisk Island, which had a

29:27.299 --> 29:31.707
volcano on the west end of it. And they were going to 
go up through the soil, and with radar, they were

29:33.340 --> 29:44.771
going to spot the target, the Navy had it on their 
plane, and they were going to bomb it. And we would

29:44.791 --> 29:51.457
be on the Navy's wing, and when they released their 
bombs, we would release ours. Well, God damn, the

29:51.477 --> 29:55.361
Navy flew us right into the volcano. And the lead 
ship crashed, blam, into the volcano. We would

29:59.385 --> 30:02.088
have been over it. So... The colonel

30:02.872 --> 30:10.622
says, what the hell were those birds? Could you 
explain the fish hook ridge? Well, it was just a

30:16.270 --> 30:26.584
mountainous

30:16.270 --> 30:26.584
group that was shaped like a fish hook in the air, 
just like a fish hook. And a lot of fighting went on

30:27.897 --> 30:35.365
there between our ground troops and the Japanese 
ground troops. And we were told that the Japs had

30:35.385 --> 30:39.710
taken Fish Hook Ridge. We were told to bomb them out 
of there. So we went and bombed it, and meanwhile

30:42.332 --> 30:46.236
our troops took it. But they didn't get their 
panels out. No day. So we just blew them to hell, our

30:51.502 --> 30:57.128
own boys. And the leader, the leader was 
honky-tonking Anchorage on my way home. A GI came

31:06.252 --> 31:12.282
up to me and he says, Lieutenant, he says, how many 
damn machine guns do you have on those B-25s? I

31:12.302 --> 31:17.310
said, well, some of them had five or six and some of 
them got two.
