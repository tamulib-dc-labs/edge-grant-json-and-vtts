WEBVTT

00:01.955 --> 00:03.016
recognized very happily. They had no trouble at 
all. Everybody got along fine. Of course, they

00:08.002 --> 00:09.724
were very high types, really. They were top 
people.

00:15.371 --> 00:22.800
In the working of, let's say, drawings and record 
keepings and so forth, whose responsibilities

00:15.371 --> 00:22.800
were those after the plant closed down? After the 
plant closed down? Well, when the plant was built

00:25.483 --> 00:31.590
originally, Hercules had a contract. that says 
that if indeed the plant is ever put up for sale,

00:31.992 --> 00:43.285
then Hercules would not bid on the plant, but they 
would have the opportunity to match the highest

00:31.992 --> 00:43.285
bidder. So the upshot was, of course, that the 
plant did revert to Hercules after it was shut

00:45.727 --> 00:49.572
down. Hearst bought a tremendous amount of stuff 
to Morgantown, wouldn't he? He came to Morgantown

00:53.676 --> 00:58.742
as resource director after they shut it down.

01:00.140 --> 01:25.995
bought an awful lot of the operating uh i might some 
of them may still be out there i don't know with

01:00.140 --> 01:25.995
charts and stuff like that but the the things that 
were really it was really too bad was that all these

01:00.140 --> 01:25.995
uh full-scale drawings of all the equipment was uh 
was thrown out how was it thrown out well this

01:00.140 --> 01:25.995
fellow they got this felt we had this 
administrative assistant like i say

01:00.140 --> 01:25.995
periodically in the government they used to say 
how many how many cubic feet of file space you got,

01:26.633 --> 01:31.257
and then you tell them, they say, get rid of 30% of 
it. So that was how you got rid of some of it. You

01:33.178 --> 01:34.299
didn't say nothing to nobody. Like I say, it was a 
body blow, but they were gone. And those were the

01:39.364 --> 01:43.087
only existing copies of it? I don't know what they 
had at Louisiana, very frankly. I just don't know.

01:47.110 --> 01:50.373
But see, at that time, the plant was shut down. We 
found out a couple of things. One, it was possible

01:54.016 --> 01:56.438
to duplicate German equipment in this country. We 
could build equipment. But the thing that you had

02:01.560 --> 02:09.753
to remember was that we were about at the, it was 
almost impossible to scale that stuff up due to the

02:01.560 --> 02:09.753
wall thickness. Due to the what? Wall thickness of 
the vessels because of the tremendously high

02:10.835 --> 02:15.082
pressure. See, those vessels were designed for 
11,000 pound pressure. And the only way that we

02:19.068 --> 02:25.058
could make the converters, they were actually, 
there was only one outfit in the country that could

02:19.068 --> 02:25.058
make them. And that was messed up here in 
Pittsburgh. And those converter bodies were

02:28.596 --> 02:33.923
actually forged on a mandrel. You can't roll 
anything that small and that thick. And of course,

02:38.069 --> 02:42.815
that was one of the big things against those kind of 
pressures. See, we don't use those kind of

02:42.835 --> 02:45.078
pressures anymore. We got away from them. And one 
of the reasons we got away from them was that you

02:46.120 --> 02:53.610
just plain can't scale up those kind of vessels. 
So, in other words, to expand the plant, to produce

02:54.772 --> 03:03.620
enough oil to be realistic would be too expensive? 
Is that what you're saying? Well, in the first

03:04.441 --> 03:13.309
place, yes, obviously, because we were off by a 
factor of five of what it would cost to make

03:04.441 --> 03:13.309
gasoline from oil, I would guess. And I thought 
that was optimistic.

03:18.453 --> 03:23.918
The process, the hydrogenation process, of 
course, at the time operated at 700 atmospheres.

03:24.910 --> 03:28.575
and that required a very special type of 
equipment. And like I say, it's almost impossible

03:28.695 --> 03:32.881
to scale up those type of vessels. And then see, we 
had water and oil washes in the gas recycle system,

03:34.202 --> 03:41.352
which again recycled 700 atmospheres. So we had a 
lot of real high-pressure vessels in that plant,

03:42.113 --> 03:46.759
and it was a relatively small plant. The plant was 
only designed for about four ton of coal an hour,

03:46.779 --> 03:53.668
and we never got up to that.

03:54.155 --> 03:57.760
Louisiana, Missouri plants produce monthly, 
or—? Well, that's hard to answer, but the

03:58.421 --> 04:04.810
aggregate—we produced over a million barrels of 
gasoline by coal hydrogenation. And we made one

04:05.991 --> 04:07.393
three-month run.

04:10.678 --> 04:12.961
And the product was shipped to Aberdeen Proving 
Ground? Oh, shipped everywhere. I'll never

04:14.483 --> 04:19.690
forget, Dr. Storch and I went to one of the Army 
posts You found out they were using the damn stuff

04:20.564 --> 04:24.328
in garbage trucks, and that hurt his pride.

04:27.291 --> 04:30.614
It was also used to fuel the Burlington Railroad. 
We ran a, yeah, that's right, on dedication, we did

04:30.634 --> 04:39.683
run a train up to Louisiana, from St. Louis to 
Louisiana, Missouri, and back. But we cheated a

04:39.703 --> 04:41.004
little bit on that. And that was that we, we, we, we, 
uh, that gasoline was made by hydrogenating the

04:41.765 --> 04:49.272
coal We were in a hurry for it. They had scheduled 
this dedication before we were ready, and Hurst

04:53.865 --> 04:58.289
had no choice. The only way he could make it was to 
run the vapor phase on our mineral, run the liquid

04:58.330 --> 05:09.360
phase on coal tar. And later on we got into it. See, 
it was a dual plan. The first thing you did, you

05:14.525 --> 05:19.410
hydrogenated the coal to make what we called a 
metal oil. And then you went over into another

05:20.251 --> 05:24.615
plant and hydrogenated the metal oil into 
gasoline. Metal oil? Middle oil. Middle oil.

05:28.339 --> 05:28.760
Middle oil. Just a term. I see. But both of these 
plants operated—both of them were designed to

05:30.701 --> 05:34.826
operate at 700 atmospheres. 10,500 pounds per 
hour? 10,500

05:38.389 --> 05:42.233
pounds. Yeah. Hmm. Did you have any problem with 
valves and this sort of thing? Oh, yeah. Yeah. We

05:46.017 --> 05:50.241
had—well, yeah, we had a lot of problems with 
valves because of the letdown and the The way we got

05:50.542 --> 05:54.946
away from that pretty much was we went to silicon 
carbide on everything. I mean, not silicon

05:55.847 --> 05:58.269
carbide, titanium carbide. No, we'll get it right 
out. Tungsten titanium carbide. But like I say, it

06:03.274 --> 06:14.404
was pretty obvious to me as a mechanical engineer 
that a plant that operated those kinds of

06:03.274 --> 06:14.404
pressures even well—of course, the same thing was 
true of ammonia. It just wasn't practical. See, we

06:17.406 --> 06:20.329
couldn't scale up the ammonia plant. We had five 
ammonia plants for about the best we ever got was

06:20.798 --> 06:31.752
200 tons a day, and now they make 1,500 tons with one 
plant.

06:34.655 --> 06:35.977
With the same process? Well, it's the same 
process, except it operates at much lower

06:35.997 --> 06:39.842
pressure. Instead of operating at 15,000 pounds, 
the ammonia plants now run at 3,200.

06:48.993 --> 06:49.894
So... The answer is that no process that has to go to 
those kind of pressures, to me at least, isn't

06:50.228 --> 06:58.679
practical. I'm not all sure they're practical, 
lower pressures. How many other Germans were

07:02.163 --> 07:04.386
involved besides these seven? That's all I know 
of. I see. And they weren't treated badly? They

07:10.414 --> 07:13.037
weren't... Oh, no, they were accepted just the 
same. I mean, they were technical people. I mean,

07:14.579 --> 07:19.105
they, you know, the wives went back and forth and 
had coffee and We went down to St. Louis together

07:19.945 --> 07:23.188
and maybe see an operator. So they were very 
rapidly, they just became a part of the community.

07:27.993 --> 07:46.392
And like I say, one thing I've noticed, and I've 
spent a lot of time in Europe, and I've noticed that

07:27.993 --> 07:46.392
you will get people who will come together or get 
together on an intelligence level more than they

07:27.993 --> 07:46.392
will actually on a national level. And, of course, 
I say these people were top people. They were

07:51.453 --> 07:55.360
intelligent people, and they just put it right in. 
How were these people chosen? Did Dr. Hurst choose

07:59.087 --> 08:00.890
them? Well, Hurst and Schroeder and a bunch of them 
went over. That's why I was still in the service.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.725
And I guess they went over and talked to these 
people. They didn't put a gun on anybody, he said,

08:10.847 --> 08:14.353
you know, the ones that wanted to come, great. 
Luckily, they were able to get to best.

08:23.457 --> 08:25.620
Where does Mr. Sternberg fit into this? I know he 
was with the Bureau of Mines. Sternberg, let's

08:27.562 --> 08:34.229
see, I think he had charge of the lab back there, as I 
remember. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He was on the,

08:35.751 --> 08:42.518
no, Sternberg was on the, he was on the technical 
reels and stuff like that. type of thing. So he was

08:44.043 --> 08:45.625
the one who was translating the German documents? 
Yeah, I think I'm pretty sure he was, yeah. Yeah, I

08:47.568 --> 08:48.890
mixed him up. Tarpley had charge of the lab.

08:58.663 --> 08:59.084
Are we okay? Yeah. But see, my job at first was, 
well, one of the things we had to do, we had to

09:00.025 --> 09:12.302
redesign the plant as far as high-pressure 
recycle compressors go. And I handled that.

09:17.590 --> 09:27.466
But we had already built up a group of people who 
could handle this high-pressure equipment. They

09:27.486 --> 09:31.412
were holdovers from the ammonia plant. So really, 
the only problems that they had were pretty much

09:32.254 --> 09:39.285
over in the hydrogenation area, as far as the 
hydrogenation goes. The hydrogen manufacturing

09:40.278 --> 09:45.103
and compression and cleanup just ran pretty 
smoothly. And like I say, we had plenty of spare

09:45.123 --> 09:48.566
equipment. See, what we did, we had one process 
hyper, and then we had another hyper just sitting

09:49.247 --> 09:55.853
there, ready to go. And then we had a third one that 
we used for inert gas. But we didn't need that much

09:59.817 --> 10:01.959
inert gas. Then later on, we bought another small 
compressor for inert gas, much lower flow, much

10:01.979 --> 10:09.306
lower power. Most of the time we got by on one hyper. 
Let me ask you, did you ever have an opportunity to

10:15.281 --> 10:24.233
talk to some of these German scientists and 
inquire how they felt about their synthetic

10:15.281 --> 10:24.233
program during the war and what problems they had? 
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's what we used to do. We used to

10:25.875 --> 10:29.921
sit around in the evening and maybe have a drink or 
two. In fact, one of the things that they—I think it

10:30.822 --> 10:37.150
was, what was it, the name? They couldn't get 
olives. They couldn't get what? They couldn't get

10:41.411 --> 10:43.154
olives in Germany. But they were all martini 
drinkers. All these Germans were. And they

10:47.962 --> 10:55.835
introduced us to another type of—oh, I guess that 
was the first time I ever saw onions in martinis.

10:56.235 --> 11:00.222
They had learned that in Germany, because they 
didn't have olives. And lemons were kind of hard to

11:00.242 --> 11:05.230
come by, too. They started the cocktail onion 
thing. But anyway, no, I can say we sat around and

11:08.450 --> 11:10.712
talked. Actually, the German synthetic fuel 
effort, at the most, was never more than about

11:12.434 --> 11:17.839
400,000 barrels a day. Roughly, they got half by 
synthetics and half from crude. So they ran the war

11:22.723 --> 11:25.045
machine, you would say, about 50 percent? Well, 
toward the end, of course, it was less, because

11:26.206 --> 11:35.014
they had a lot of planes and stuff sitting on the 
ground.

11:35.551 --> 11:38.315
had a pretty high priority for the bombers, too. Of 
course. Did they imply that politics that, uh,

11:40.097 --> 11:48.569
hampered or favored their production during the 
war? Um, yes, yes. Of course, it was very, as you

11:49.710 --> 11:55.158
know, it was very political, and you had, well, 
actually, you had a maniac running the goddamn

11:49.710 --> 11:55.158
country. So what could you expect? So, no, he, he 
did everything. He ran everything from the seat of

12:00.886 --> 12:02.448
his britches. The upshot was that even people like 
Speer, who had charge of everything under Hitler,

12:05.099 --> 12:12.446
was still frequently overruled by Hitler on 
things. The hierarchy over there was Speer, I

12:13.928 --> 12:25.199
guess, who had everything, and then a fellow named 
Peer, who had all synthetics, and then Donath, who

12:13.928 --> 12:25.199
had coal hydrogenation. He was head of the coal 
hydrogenation program. He was the head guy we

12:28.322 --> 12:29.623
brought over. Does the name Rowland sound 
familiar? Who?

12:30.984 --> 12:33.587
R-O-E-L-A-N-T-H-A-T-H-A-T-H-A-T-H-A-T-H-A-T-H-A-T-H-A-T-H-A-T-H-A-T-H-A-T-H-A-T-H-A-T-H-A-T-H-A-T-H-A-T-H-A-T-H-A-T-H-A-T-H-A-T-H- 
H-L-E-N. Rowland? No. As a German scientist who

12:37.015 --> 12:40.780
was in charge, perhaps, under Donoff? No, he 
wasn't. We had nobody by that name, I reckon. I

12:42.543 --> 12:43.324
couldn't remember. Uh-huh. No. No.

12:51.775 --> 12:56.462
Now, when time comes for the plant to be shut down, 
were you still around then? Yeah, I was here. I had

12:57.883 --> 13:02.730
moved back here and started at the place at the 
station out here, I'd move back here and start a

13:03.335 --> 13:07.359
pressure gasification program. Because my 
calculations show that we could make a tremendous

13:07.379 --> 13:18.890
saving in horsepower by generating either the 
hydrogen or the hydrogen plus CO and the elevated

13:07.379 --> 13:18.890
pressures. And of course, a compressor curve is a 
logarithmic curve. The pressure, I mean, the

13:25.236 --> 13:29.960
power varies as the logarithm of the pressure, not 
as the pressure. So that says that the low

13:30.000 --> 13:32.903
pressures are where you use the most power. So I 
started my program at 450 PSI, figuring at that

13:34.452 --> 13:47.146
time I'd made an awful lot of the potential 
savings, even if you went up, say, to 10,000

13:34.452 --> 13:47.146
pounds.

13:49.809 --> 13:54.213
And what was the reaction of the Bureau of Mines 
when they discovered the decision is to close the

13:49.809 --> 13:54.213
plant? Well, the fine damn thing was to shut that 
thing off. Thanks.
