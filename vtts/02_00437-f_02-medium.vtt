WEBVTT

00:02.613 --> 00:08.080
Sounds like you had a lot of duties, a lot of 
responsibilities. How were they? At Twethler?

00:11.905 --> 00:12.406
Yeah. Oh. Well, I had essentially the same types of 
forces under me that I'd been supervising

00:14.909 --> 00:26.264
within my responsibility in Southeast Asia. 
F-105, fighter bombers.

00:33.578 --> 00:45.994
groups, special action forces, special service 
forces, staff forces, troop carrier forces.

00:48.457 --> 00:52.001
Essentially, well, tactical air command and 
tactical air warfare are the same. My

00:52.241 --> 00:55.165
responsibilities

00:55.769 --> 00:58.112
were, I had the responsibility. I wasn't a deputy 
or assistant. I had the responsibility. I was the

01:01.435 --> 01:03.457
boss. And I told you geographic, area-wise, to 
what extent. And my job, of course, was training

01:08.843 --> 01:16.271
these horses and keeping them, keeping, 
maintaining their training. Keeping them

01:16.752 --> 01:21.837
supplied, maintained, and combat ready as 
possible. And of course, continued to provide the

01:24.608 --> 01:34.003
replacements in their various categories from 
officers and airman skills over to Vietnam would

01:24.608 --> 01:34.003
reject where I came from. So, you know, I had, I was 
well qualified, exceedingly, terrifically well

01:34.023 --> 01:42.597
qualified to take over my job. Sounds like it'd be a 
much, I don't want to, well it sounds like a, an

01:49.465 --> 01:53.270
easier or a smoother operation than in Vietnam. It 
doesn't sound like in Thailand. It doesn't sound

01:56.874 --> 02:00.599
like as many problems. Is that true? Well, oh, 
considerably different from the standpoint of

02:02.021 --> 02:16.779
pressure and the hectic and the, for instance, the 
realization that I've got to be available right by

02:02.021 --> 02:16.779
my command post 24 hours a day. And to a certain 
extent, you know, I... Gee, the insurgent might

02:20.127 --> 02:25.056
attack my base right now. That type of thing. Now, 
from the standpoint of responsibility for the

02:27.340 --> 02:43.249
morale of my people, the responsibility of seeing 
if they're properly trained, I mean, properly

02:27.340 --> 02:43.249
fed, properly the bases taken care of, the 
aircraft properly supplied and maintained,

02:27.340 --> 02:43.249
exactly the same.

02:59.716 --> 03:05.603
Were there any main challenges that you had in 
terms of the 12th? As a matter of fact, there

03:05.623 --> 03:11.049
was no problem. As a matter of fact, I enjoyed it. It 
was a relaxation to come back and go down there, of

03:14.714 --> 03:17.957
course.

03:23.244 --> 03:26.247
I think the biggest wasn't a challenge. to move my 
headquarters down to Berksham Air Force Base in

03:28.387 --> 03:33.555
Austin, Texas. And, of course, I continually and 
closely supervised that, including the

03:33.575 --> 03:56.031
construction and layout and planning of a brand 
new building, if you will, a mini Pentagon

03:33.575 --> 03:56.031
building, except this was an oval shaped 
building, dictated to a great extent by the

03:33.575 --> 03:56.031
President of the United States. Oh, really? I was 
going to ask, why did you move from Waco to Austin?

04:01.810 --> 04:12.929
Well, first of all, I'm sure that entered into it, 
probably primarily, but see, we didn't have a base

04:01.810 --> 04:12.929
as such at Waco. I just had a flight section out at 
old James Connolly Air Force Base, which used to be

04:13.390 --> 04:18.559
a training area.

04:23.028 --> 04:24.549
permanent air force base. It's permanent. And 
band

04:26.091 --> 04:47.730
power-wise and expense-wise, it would cut 
expenses to consolidate my headquarters on a

04:26.091 --> 04:47.730
tactical basis, Berkson being primarily a 
reconnaissance-equipped base, a

04:26.091 --> 04:47.730
reconnaissance wing there, and get rid of the Wake 
Oaks hood. It saved money, so it made sense.

04:59.005 --> 05:13.743
But it was done, and it so happened that I laid out 
all the plans and was prepared to actually move in

04:59.005 --> 05:13.743
September when within a month's time I decided to 
retire. Okay, now this might sound like a silly

05:14.504 --> 05:23.796
question to someone who's not in the know about air 
bases, but why didn't you go down to San Antonio and

05:14.504 --> 05:23.796
move down there? Because they have such 
facilities down there. Well, San Antonio was

05:27.693 --> 05:38.209
overburdened at the bases with logistic 
organizations, and there was no room for my

05:27.693 --> 05:38.209
headquarters to be down there. And tactically, it 
didn't make sense. It ought to be on one of my air

05:40.632 --> 05:42.896
bases. And actually, economics-wise, the United 
States, and politics-wise, San Antonio has got,

05:43.937 --> 05:55.995
you might say, more than its share of military 
population. LBJ came out to honor you. Tell me

05:59.831 --> 06:01.813
about that. That was on one of his, you mean at 
Bergstrom? Yeah. That was on one of his, the

06:04.836 --> 06:11.323
presidential trips to his home where, you know, 
he'd take vacations. Quite often, his ranch. And

06:13.685 --> 06:15.087
he always landed at Bergstrom. But it so happened 
that through the channels down through, and of

06:15.107 --> 06:23.375
course the Air Force provided the American 
administration all the time. Really, he provided

06:23.395 --> 06:25.257
the crews for his number one.

06:30.248 --> 06:53.534
But I was to receive an honor for being

06:30.248 --> 06:53.534
one Air Force in the entire United States that had 
sold the most bonds, had most bonds purchased by

06:30.248 --> 06:53.534
airmen and officers from any Air Force in the 
United States. Therefore, I was being awarded a

06:53.554 --> 06:58.180
pennant called an E-Pennant or something. A flag. 
I guess that's what you call it, yeah. And of course

07:02.413 --> 07:05.618
it was quite an honor and I was going to accept it. So 
arrangements were made way up above the top of me

07:05.658 --> 07:25.888
when President Johnson come down, why not let's 
have him present this flag to you and be, and I'm

07:05.658 --> 07:25.888
sure he wanted to do it because, you know, give him a 
chance to be amongst the military as well as the

07:05.658 --> 07:25.888
citizens of Austin. He agreed with it, so that's 
the reason it was done. And he personally, this was

07:28.763 --> 07:33.550
all laid on, when he landed, I agreed with him 
naturally. And then all this, the airfield was

07:33.670 --> 07:41.020
flooded with the Austin civilians. Press corps. 
Oh, absolutely. And then he, in fact, TV and radio,

07:43.603 --> 07:49.010
and he presented me this flag. And then made a short 
speech about how he was proud of the military and

07:49.371 --> 07:55.639
also the city of Austin and so forth. Very well 
received, and I consider it quite an honor. What

08:00.525 --> 08:02.167
was your opinion of Johnson? I liked him. I liked 
him. Even though you're a conservative, you told

08:04.010 --> 08:06.173
me before. That's right. About three days ago. I 
agree, but he... Why did you like him? I think he had

08:11.762 --> 08:15.107
a sincere feeling for his fellow man. And he was 
kind of an easy...

08:16.268 --> 08:25.322
Maybe other people would call him a smoothie, but 
I... He was easy talking. I met him once before and

08:27.830 --> 08:35.161
greeted him in Thailand at this huge bomber base 
down in southern Thailand, you know, when he came

08:27.830 --> 08:35.161
over. And he was the same way, easy going, easy 
talking. In other words, a typical good old fellow

08:40.610 --> 08:49.263
with a Texas grow, if you will. I liked him. He was 
just personable, all very, very. I know for a fact

08:55.643 --> 08:58.926
that he could be a different man. I heard stories 
where, boy, he just literally ate out

09:00.788 --> 09:10.738
you-know-what of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for not 
doing better in the war in Southeast Asia.

09:10.978 --> 09:15.002
Couldn't understand why with all the equipment 
that they had and so forth. Okay, now, during this

09:15.042 --> 09:23.490
time, during 1968, of course, we had the Tet 
Offensive in Vietnam on January 31, 1968. here at

09:23.926 --> 09:26.329
the 12th Air Base. And by 1968, there were anti-war 
protesters in the United States. And I was

09:32.658 --> 09:39.047
wondering if you ever had any protests outside 
your headquarters, or on the base, or had any

09:32.658 --> 09:39.047
dealings with this whatsoever. No, I can't 
remember ever having a problem at any of my bases

09:41.010 --> 09:49.702
with protesters. Did you have any problems 
whatsoever with any civilians? No. As a matter of

09:55.212 --> 10:05.146
fact, every base, this is one thing I pushed, was 
social relations with the communities where we

09:55.212 --> 10:05.146
were based. And I always gave high priority to 
this, and our base commanders easily understood

10:05.487 --> 10:14.560
this. I don't remember ever any occasion where I 
had a problem of that nature. And at Waco, It just

10:24.389 --> 10:28.995
broke the hearts of those people when we had to 
move. The mayor and the councilman and all that.

10:34.102 --> 10:38.868
Let's change the topic now to advancement in the 
military. We've touched a little bit on this

10:38.888 --> 10:40.490
before. You said that you were an ambitious man in 
the military, right? No more ambitious than the

10:44.856 --> 10:46.698
average one. But I call myself ambitious, yeah. 
Okay. Thinking back on the military career,

10:50.063 --> 10:52.506
though, Did you leave advancement, promotion, to 
fate or luck, or did you think that you had control

10:53.110 --> 11:06.921
over your own advancement?

11:06.941 --> 11:12.553
Oh, there's

11:06.941 --> 11:12.553
no doubt that such a thing as luck Right, right. 
There's no doubt there's such, maybe quite fate,

11:15.892 --> 11:21.698
but there's no doubt that there's such thing as 
that in our life. But I sure agree that every person

11:22.458 --> 11:31.307
has a certain amount of control over what he can do. 
I definitely agree with that. Is that primary or is

11:33.850 --> 11:35.391
fate? Primary on what? Our fate. Which one's more 
important? Oh, your... Don't depend on luck. On

11:45.752 --> 11:46.652
accomplishments. Right. Okay. Do you think, what 
about advancement as far as the military? We might

11:53.759 --> 11:56.181
have talked about this a little or talked around it 
a little. The military advancement, do you

11:56.221 --> 12:10.573
advance the same way that somebody get ahead in the 
military, get a command position in the military

11:56.221 --> 12:10.573
the same way that you do in business or the 
professional world? Are there differences? In my

12:12.695 --> 12:13.776
opinion, I am glad you asked that. Because you've 
been in both of them. Right. You've been in TI. I was

12:19.380 --> 12:23.504
ten years at TI right after I got out of the Air 
Force, retired. As a matter of fact, I even stood up

12:23.744 --> 12:39.799
and told my bosses and the chairman of the 
corporation right on down at TI, there ain't no

12:23.744 --> 12:39.799
difference whatsoever. Some things are basic. 
Some things are basic. And what were those basics

12:43.962 --> 12:46.465
to you? Capability is one thing. Anybody 
recognizes capability.

12:53.433 --> 12:56.877
Number one, though, in my opinion, is integrity. 
Integrity.

13:01.923 --> 13:04.566
Can you trust a person? Is he reliable? Will he tell 
you the truth? Will he tell you he's made a mistake?

13:15.400 --> 13:23.796
Will he tell you that what I'm recommending to him, 
that it's a bad idea? Will he be a yes man? Can I

13:28.705 --> 13:29.667
depend on it? Is he reliable? Integrity, I'm 
talking about. You know why. Absolutely. Which is

13:36.099 --> 13:36.900
honesty. Right.

13:42.232 --> 13:48.060
And I'm sure any military man and any civilian 
corporate official. As a matter of fact, it so

13:48.080 --> 14:00.698
happens that Fred Busey of Texas Institute, the 
chairman, executive president of TI, puts this as

13:48.080 --> 14:00.698
his number one requirement for an executive at TI. 
Integrity? Yes, sir. And

14:04.224 --> 14:09.471
obviously, capabilities. Can the man, is he 
capable, is he competent? Okay, now, you've been

14:13.591 --> 14:20.001
in both the business world at a high level and in the 
military world at a high level. Do they think, do

14:21.203 --> 14:26.111
people out in society think differently? In other 
words, is there what some people have called a

14:26.271 --> 14:30.919
military mentality? Have you heard that term, 
military mentality? Oh, yeah, I've heard that.

14:34.196 --> 14:35.097
Would you define it? Is there one? Well, I tell you 
what I think civilians mean when they say you have a

14:36.038 --> 14:42.486
military mentality. I think they mean that you're 
regimented. You're regimented. You're told what

14:50.957 --> 14:52.118
to do. You're used to being this. You're 
disciplined to a rut, if you will. You have no

14:59.968 --> 15:01.210
flexibilities. Now, you think, you don't think 
flexibly, and this is absolutely nonsense. The

15:09.404 --> 15:25.400
current officer, in my opinion, even more so now 
than in my earlier days, he has to be equally as

15:09.404 --> 15:25.400
capable as any manager of a corporation you can 
think of. You compare my salary As the Air Force

15:29.000 --> 15:47.312
commander of 12th Air Force commanding some 
45,000 people with, let's say at the time I joined

15:29.000 --> 15:47.312
Texas Instruments with

15:29.000 --> 15:47.312
the president of TI at that time, Mark Sheppard, 
who is now the chairman of the board with his salary

15:47.680 --> 15:53.348
and about the same number of people, say, in 1968. 
Maybe not that many, maybe 30,000 people. Compare

15:57.633 --> 15:58.555
their salaries. Yeah, he probably made

15:58.575 --> 16:07.787
fringe benefits and salary included. He probably 
made

16:07.947 --> 16:16.118
four times as much as I made in dollars.

16:19.169 --> 16:25.177
You'll get the argument, yeah, but you don't have a 
budget control over you. That's not true. That's

16:26.779 --> 16:30.004
nonsense.

16:30.545 --> 16:34.831
You don't have to perform efficiently as I do. I get 
fired. Remember me telling you about the fear of

16:38.055 --> 16:42.361
the way psych control people? Sure. I have fired 
people. I have fired people under me. I was told by

16:50.219 --> 16:54.165
TR... For being incompetent? Well, incompetent, 
mainly, yeah. Not telling me truth.

17:02.657 --> 17:04.800
Mainly not doing a job.

17:08.966 --> 17:11.110
So we've covered that military mentality. You 
don't believe there is one, sir? There used to be.

17:14.254 --> 17:15.216
There used to be. Oh, how did this change? What do 
you mean, there used to be? Oh... Before the war? I

17:21.407 --> 17:27.559
remember when I joined the National Guard as a 
private in 1932.

17:29.062 --> 17:42.568
You

17:29.062 --> 17:42.568
talk about a regimented man, yeah, but the quality 
of the man then was not what it is now. Remember me

17:43.004 --> 17:49.213
telling you about the Air Force establishment 
system by which I got to go to college. We want our

17:49.233 --> 17:52.017
officers with college degrees.

17:56.244 --> 18:02.292
Look at the retirement of General Hay, who is now 
the Secretary of State, a few months ago. Look at

18:02.913 --> 18:05.938
the civilian job he had and was given. The chairman 
of, what is it, United Technologies. And look at

18:12.232 --> 18:15.315
the money he was immediately paid. As a matter of 
fact, I remember in the later years of my military

18:15.355 --> 18:42.137
career, some, I think it was Chief of Staff, 
General McConnell or probably generals before

18:15.355 --> 18:42.137
him, Chief of Staff, making speeches throughout 
that And certainly taught at the Air Force

18:42.303 --> 19:05.459
Academy, by the way, an

18:42.303 --> 19:05.459
instancy had been 10, 12 years ago, 15 years ago, 
that an officer nowadays had to be a manager, had to

18:42.303 --> 19:05.459
be a diplomat, had to be a chaplain, had to be an 
officer. You name it, he had to be all of them. Do you

19:07.767 --> 19:15.279
think this has changed because of the tremendous 
growth in the American armed services since the

19:07.767 --> 19:15.279
Second World War and the increase in importance? 
Right, and the integration into the way of life of

19:15.519 --> 19:22.831
the modern power of the nature of the United 
States. And armed force reflects, its people

19:23.632 --> 19:27.919
reflects, the, if you will, the culture and status 
and nature characteristics of its civilian

19:28.777 --> 19:36.204
population. It reflects it directly. Okay. Now 
let's shift to why you retired. Why did I retire?

19:44.112 --> 19:55.864
This was really an emotional,

19:44.112 --> 19:55.864
it was a problem of mixed emotion.

19:58.308 --> 20:12.029
I've been in the service since, I've been in the 
military, like I've told you in previous

19:58.308 --> 20:12.029
discussions the last two or three days, since 
1930, during the high school ROTC as a buck

19:58.308 --> 20:12.029
private.

20:13.552 --> 20:15.335
I've been in two wars.

20:18.439 --> 20:25.210
I was content and happy with my progress or the 
achievement of a historic general. I was still

20:29.598 --> 20:32.441
ambitious. I had no doubt in my mind I could go on 
higher. No doubt in my mind. A military, I mean.

20:40.349 --> 20:43.171
Were you called out? No. By, oh, well, officers 
told me, sure. In their disgust, yeah, it's

20:44.673 --> 20:47.876
implied. But you know, you feel, you know, any guy 
does, unless you kid yourself.

20:58.028 --> 21:10.188
I knew that inevitably my next job had to be, had to 
be, almost without a doubt, the Pentagon, which I

20:58.028 --> 21:10.188
certainly did want. Or probably vice commander of 
TAC, which did have been a promotion, probably

21:10.208 --> 21:18.201
both of them went to promotion. And I'd been vice 
commander of some jobs before, a number two man.

21:26.851 --> 21:27.752
I could relax. Well, I never relaxed no matter what 
job I had. Sure. So I'd been given some thought to

21:31.158 --> 21:32.921
it. Say I was tired from war coming. Well, that's 
not true. See, I had a year, I had time to relax here.

21:40.253 --> 21:41.375
I had a 12th Air Force. I was a commander. Everybody 
shoots for a job. I had an ideal job, and I was happy.

21:46.784 --> 21:52.453
Didn't have any problems, no worries, except what 
you have ordinarily, data. But I think the

21:52.973 --> 21:57.898
Starbroke Camelback is a- They're eating out. 
Okay. My wife just came in and I was going to talk

21:58.919 --> 22:01.622
about it. Okay, well tell me this and then we'll 
eat. The Starbroke Camelback is my wife got sick

22:04.985 --> 22:16.377
and it was obvious she had to have a- Hysterectomy. 
Hysterectomy.

22:19.771 --> 22:25.779
It was, as I say, we didn't have an air base or any 
military facility there, so... Medical

22:19.771 --> 22:25.779
facility. Medical facility, so we had to go to a 
local civilian doctor in Waco and a hospital,

22:25.799 --> 22:38.615
well-equipped hospital, and the doctor took care 
of her, and she was scheduled for surgery, and she

22:25.799 --> 22:38.615
had a hysterectomy. Unfortunately, within about 
24 hours, she had an abdominal block, intestinal

22:39.977 --> 22:48.107
block, And I'm convinced today through sloppy 
procedures. And she had to be rescheduled for

22:55.166 --> 23:02.914
emergency operation again by another doctor. And 
it was nip and tuck for a few hours. But

23:07.718 --> 23:11.862
fortunately, she recovered and lived. But it was 
some tense moments I went through. really made me

23:16.218 --> 23:22.784
think and I just came to the conclusion that I 
dragged my family and her all over the world. We

23:22.844 --> 23:32.413
moved some 26 times in about 22 years.

23:32.433 --> 23:42.563
I made up my mind I was going to retire and try to live 
a restful life in retirement and enjoy it and try to

23:32.433 --> 23:42.563
enjoy life with her. and still had two of my four 
children living with us. So I made the decision,

23:46.802 --> 23:49.966
decided to write a letter. And I remember General 
McCollum was still chief of staff at that time.

23:54.151 --> 24:00.459
General Diss's way, I told him about it, he was 
absolutely caught completely off guard. And

24:00.479 --> 24:02.942
Diss, he said, Charlie, you don't mean it. He was 
surprised. He didn't expect it whatsoever,

24:04.444 --> 24:08.989
because he was doing a fine job under him. And he 
said, well, you have to tell General McCollum to

24:09.009 --> 24:12.634
write a letter so I can get it. What you want to do? I 
told him the whole story. And knowing him now. You

24:17.564 --> 24:19.547
told him this his way the whole story? Oh, yeah. And 
the trick man. He knew. He understood. Matter of

24:23.973 --> 24:25.235
fact, he retired. So happy he retired the day after 
I did. But I wrote a letter to General McConnell and

24:29.041 --> 24:39.516
to his deputy chief of staff personnel, 
Lieutenant General, I can't remember his name by

24:40.930 --> 24:44.014
now, whom I know very well. He called me on the 
telephone and said, John Charles, you've caught

24:44.134 --> 24:49.420
General McConaughey. General McConaughey, I'm 
mad at you. I said, well, I, this was one of the

24:53.205 --> 25:03.597
things I was worried about, but I said, I, 
sincerely, I assure you I wouldn't do it unless I

24:53.205 --> 25:03.597
thought it was the proper thing to do. I know 
General McCollum gave me this job, and I

25:04.403 --> 25:14.057
appreciate it all, and I just hope you can explain 
it to him, and I'd be more than happy to come up and

25:04.403 --> 25:14.057
sit down and try to question him. He said, no. He 
said, if you want to, he told me, he said, if you want

25:14.899 --> 25:19.525
to, go ahead and retire. He said, he'll prove it. So 
it was laid on, and I retired August 1, 1968.

25:30.462 --> 25:30.782
I cried.

25:39.993 --> 25:42.857
Was it a nice ceremony, and did they have a big 
review for you? Oh, yeah. Matter of fact, general

25:44.059 --> 25:46.062
discipline came down. No kidding? Yeah. And then 
he went out for his own retirement the next day? And

25:49.387 --> 25:52.391
I got on the airplane to Flying Bay and left his 
retirement. Oh, you did? Yeah. And then didn't you

25:53.974 --> 26:01.745
tell me that the next day after that you started at 
Texas Instruments? Officially, I was put on the

26:02.046 --> 26:06.212
payroll at TI the next day. Mm-hmm. That is not the 
primary reason I retired. Oh, no. I didn't infer

26:11.290 --> 26:12.051
that. I'm just saying that you had things to look 
forward to. As a matter of fact, that's one of the

26:14.974 --> 26:21.081
things I was looking forward to, realizing the 
capability of the TI, seeing what they had done. I

26:21.101 --> 26:29.290
had to basically go up there and did promote the 
development of technology at TI, and they've done

26:21.101 --> 26:29.290
wonders. What was your title at TI? We're not going 
to get into it.

26:35.545 --> 26:36.767
They didn't know for a while. Matter of fact, I 
found out after about six months they were going to

26:37.408 --> 26:52.431
make me administrator of a special, no, 
administrator of a weapons system group. But it

26:53.112 --> 26:57.379
turned out I was a marketing specialist.

27:00.263 --> 27:03.949
I forget actually what the title would be, but it 
was primarily Marketing for the equipment

27:04.469 --> 27:20.684
group, which is oriented primarily to the 
military, R&D and development of military

27:04.469 --> 27:20.684
equipment. Sure. OK, let's stop.

27:25.348 --> 27:27.370
Could you define leadership for me? No easy 
things. Just like that, huh?

27:37.105 --> 27:38.288
Define leadership.

27:46.204 --> 27:56.025
I guess if you tried to define it in a classical 
sense in the term of a dictionary, I'd say

27:46.204 --> 27:56.025
probably the best way to define it is

28:05.658 --> 28:11.625
The ability to get people to do what you want

28:05.658 --> 28:11.625
them to. But this needs further explanation.

28:28.645 --> 28:30.387
Many times, though, I've been asked this 
question. I ought to be able to tell you right now,

28:30.407 --> 28:34.652
but you know you always think about it. And I'll 
probably get around to ask a lot of rambling

28:36.758 --> 28:40.943
moments and what I've always said. That's funny.

28:48.611 --> 29:00.505
I usually try to think of it in terms of the people 
I've been under and who are the most effective ones

28:48.611 --> 29:00.505
from the standpoint of getting me to do what they 
want me to do, that they wanted me to do for them. All

29:01.058 --> 29:05.203
the leaders I've told you that I wonder, you know, 
where his thinking is. In other words, the guys I

29:05.223 --> 29:07.906
hated, the guys I loved. Okay, the guys I loved 
probably had more leadership than the guys I

29:08.187 --> 29:12.612
hated. You know, that type of thing. So my 
reasoning process and analysis to answer your

29:13.974 --> 29:17.618
question. I think the main ingredient in 
leadership

29:17.638 --> 29:27.690
is a natural

29:31.535 --> 29:38.525
characteristic of a person to get along with 
people, generally speaking, to get along with

29:31.535 --> 29:38.525
people. And to me, this means he knows how to handle 
people. If he can handle a truculent type of a

29:43.652 --> 29:54.687
maverick

29:43.652 --> 29:54.687
and get him to do well under him, then he knows how to 
handle people. If he can get a gold brick to perform

29:55.468 --> 30:01.356
under him, then he knows how to handle people. The 
ability to handle people. And rapidly, right

30:06.772 --> 30:13.621
underneath that, maybe that's not a number one 
thing, and maybe I'm not looking at priorities

30:06.772 --> 30:13.621
right now. Let's talk about that. Sure, we're just 
talking about characteristics. But readily, the

30:16.304 --> 30:22.832
next thing that comes to me, just what I was telling 
you about a while ago, is integrity. Integrity of a

30:24.134 --> 30:25.396
man. This goes as well

30:25.496 --> 30:30.482
up. respect for your boss or consideration for 
your subordinate down. If your subordinate

30:38.609 --> 30:49.708
respects you and knows you're telling them that 
you're honest and respects your integrity and

30:38.609 --> 30:49.708
knows you've got integrity, he's going to respect 
you. To me, integrity again. Integrity is so basic

30:51.932 --> 30:55.137
in everything.

31:00.027 --> 31:14.222
And the third element, I would say, a very 
important factor is

31:00.027 --> 31:14.222
your capability and competence in the area of 
which you are a commander. In other words, can you

31:14.282 --> 31:18.446
do what you expect your people to do? And here 
again, as I go back to old General LeMay, he flew

31:19.527 --> 31:26.895
combat in B-17. In the roughest time, as a leader, 
he was a leader.

31:33.582 --> 31:36.105
People knew he knew what he was talking about. He'd 
been there. That's right. You've been there. You

31:39.288 --> 31:40.409
know what you're talking about. Don't tell me you 
can't do it, son. I've done it. Do it.

31:50.120 --> 31:56.547
Not necessarily in that tone of voice, but it's 
that expectancy, both on the part of your

31:50.120 --> 31:56.547
subordinate and on the part of your commander. You 
expect a man to do it. But see, that includes

32:00.598 --> 32:03.603
integrity also. You trust and respect and rely on 
him to do it. But he knows that you can do it, and this

32:06.166 --> 32:26.835
gives credence to the belief of the subordinate 
that this man, my commander, wouldn't tell me to do

32:06.166 --> 32:26.835
this unless he knew that I could do it, unless he 
knew that it could be done because he's done it. And

32:27.473 --> 32:33.141
this readily leads into the next one, which I'd say 
is motivation. If you can motivate, the

32:33.161 --> 32:41.092
capability to motivate, inspire, which is 
essentially the same thing. Sure. You can

32:42.695 --> 32:43.856
motivate a man. T.I. was great in the business 
world of using the word motivation. You know, it's

32:51.127 --> 32:53.330
how you entertain and inspire. I think in the 
military... You could use the word motivation,

32:55.874 --> 33:00.782
but inspiring a man under you to do it. I think it's 
an even more meaningful word.

33:11.999 --> 33:13.342
We're inspired by heroes. People have done 
things. You motivate for it, but you're inspired

33:17.809 --> 33:21.274
by a hero. You could be motivated by a ruthless, 
mean individual. You know you better do it because

33:26.289 --> 33:28.192
you're scared to death. You could be motivated by a 
very meek,

33:29.735 --> 33:41.837
incompetent officer begging you practically, 
gee, I can't do this. Look, you've got to get this

33:41.857 --> 33:43.359
done for me. I'm going to be in trouble. You've got 
to get it done. You can be, you know, subordinate,

33:45.537 --> 33:49.242
might be motivated that way. But it's neither one 
of these I'm talking about. I'm talking about a

33:51.205 --> 34:01.640
sincere, just an inherent in the situation, an 
inherent capability of the commander, the

33:51.205 --> 34:01.640
leader, that he motivates people. He motivates 
them by his appearance, by his personality, by his

34:01.680 --> 34:12.134
manner of speaking, his experience, what he's 
been through. Maybe the ribbon's on his chest.

34:15.642 --> 34:20.148
Maybe he doesn't even have a tunic on, but his 
personality is such. He inspires belief in him.

34:24.334 --> 34:26.938
It's effect on people. Sure. Motivation. These 
are all different types of, in other words, we're

34:29.021 --> 34:36.732
defining leadership by the type of values that a 
leader should have. Well, that's right. Because

34:38.414 --> 34:41.999
that's the other question I'd like to ask the 
generals. And you've talked about being

34:42.440 --> 34:44.603
competent. having integrity, being respectful 
of others, being able to handle people, being able

34:45.123 --> 34:51.972
to motivate. I mean, these are sort of values. 
These are values, I say, that make for leadership.

34:57.259 --> 35:00.063
That's what I'm trying to find leadership in. What 
are the characteristics of good leadership? OK.

35:05.690 --> 35:09.575
Personally, what type of these values did you 
have? I tried to have them all. You know,

35:14.823 --> 35:21.431
everybody, you, know your weaknesses and 
strengths better than anybody else in the world,

35:14.823 --> 35:21.431
whether you admit them or not. I've often told my 
kid, be honest with yourself, recognize your

35:21.811 --> 35:26.657
strengths and weaknesses. That really brings up 
probably a fifth or sixth one I can pass on to you

35:28.479 --> 35:34.806
right now, what I think of leadership. And I give 
credit to Eisenhower for not teaching me this, but

35:34.826 --> 35:44.577
learning it from reading about him and 
experiences about him. I think one of his greatest

35:45.063 --> 35:56.753
characteristics and traits that had been said of 
him, and I agree, and look at the job he did, and you

35:45.063 --> 35:56.753
talk about my job as different bosses and 
different types I had to deal with. Look at his

35:57.233 --> 36:02.958
ability to pick people under him to do a job.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.041
You're feeling about a person. I want that man. 
You're readily, an immediate assessment of a

36:08.523 --> 36:11.325
person. I want this type of person under me. Your 
recognition, immediately, of the capability of

36:15.421 --> 36:18.386
the person. You know a good man when you see him. I 
think this is one of Eisenhower's greatest

36:20.610 --> 36:24.616
capabilities. He knew how to pick the right type of 
person. Therefore, he eliminated a lot of his

36:27.221 --> 36:29.304
problems. Okay, that's one of his great 
characteristics as a leader. Another one about

36:34.052 --> 36:39.421
Eisenhower, and there's no doubt about this, is 
that he was a conciliator. He had the ability to

36:42.607 --> 36:54.703
work with people with very large egos, like 
Churchill, and Roosevelt, and Monty Montgomery,

36:42.607 --> 36:54.703
and Patton, and get them all to work for a common 
goal. Right. And it surprises me, sir, that you

36:55.404 --> 37:08.361
haven't brought this out about yourself, because 
in almost every position that you had from Italy

36:55.404 --> 37:08.361
all the way to Thailand, you were working with some 
pretty egotistical, Pretty high-powered

37:08.645 --> 37:12.450
people, and you were trying to keep them to work 
together. Don't you think that's part of

37:12.510 --> 37:14.332
leadership? Well, I mentioned you're a 
conciliator. Well, yeah, you could. Is this not

37:20.200 --> 37:23.344
covered by ability to handle people? Sure. You 
know, can you handle your boss? Sure you can. You

37:27.970 --> 37:31.955
don't speak of it in that term, but you can handle 
your boss. And you put it in other words, and it's a

37:31.975 --> 37:36.320
better understanding of what I'm trying to say. I 
agree with you. And conciliatory has the...

37:38.210 --> 37:45.076
You're a compromiser. I mean, you compromise 
people. To me, that's a better word. Conciliatory

37:48.019 --> 37:50.381
has the connotation of... Appeasement. You're 
stepping down. I'm not talking about that. No, no.

37:57.447 --> 37:59.368
Compromise, I guess, is involved. It's involved 
in conciliation. Obviously it is. You manage two

38:03.712 --> 38:07.035
different... You were... I don't want to put words 
in your mouth, but it seems like when you were

38:07.420 --> 38:19.596
working between the Ambassador in Laos and 
Westmoreland, here you are as you're trying to get

38:07.420 --> 38:19.596
people to work in a common direction.

38:23.061 --> 38:28.288
Manage differences for a common goal, or 
consolidate differences for a common goal.

38:28.308 --> 38:31.032
Influencing people to do what you know has to be 
done. And furthermore, getting it done with a

38:31.733 --> 38:35.858
little fuss and What about the use of punishment in 
the military? Certainly, especially enlisted

38:41.647 --> 38:47.876
men get into problems. Many of these people, 
young, relatively uneducated, away from home for

38:47.956 --> 38:58.410
the very first time sitting on an air base in 
Thailand, something like that, get out of hand,

38:47.956 --> 38:58.410
get a little rowdy. It's only natural for anybody 
who's 19. What were your ideas on punishing these

39:03.057 --> 39:07.361
people, maintaining discipline? Well, you've 
always got to, it's not only military, but life.

39:14.408 --> 39:18.312
You've got to have punishment, and we probably 
always will. Everybody isn't perfect. There's

39:21.515 --> 39:24.658
always going to be those, and you've got to have a 
means. That is understood, generally, also. The

39:28.690 --> 39:32.814
more it's understood and known, the better, more 
effective it'll be. If you do certain things,

39:32.834 --> 39:37.939
you're going to be punished. Now, the level of 
punishment, this is, boy, what a controversial

39:37.960 --> 39:44.266
thing. The more universal and uniform you can have 
rules of punishment, by far, the better they are.

39:51.714 --> 39:55.157
You've read today, it may... Less arbitrary. 
Well, yes, but... Look how the rules vary

39:57.192 --> 40:01.979
throughout the United States and civil courts, 
between judges. You read of it every day. And this

40:04.002 --> 40:25.534
is,

40:04.002 --> 40:25.534
you must strive to make it universally 
applicable, where if some new man comes to your

40:04.002 --> 40:25.534
outfit, and let's say he either intentionally or 
unintentionally does something, he knows what

40:04.002 --> 40:25.534
the consequence is going to be. It's going to be the 
same. is where he came from, or else he'd be

40:26.993 --> 40:30.678
completely the other side of the world. 
Therefore, a certain amount of punishment must be

40:33.382 --> 40:38.230
set out in rules and regulations. It's got to be so 
that they can be better distributed and

40:38.670 --> 40:42.897
understood. But the main thing about punishment, 
in my opinion, is it's got to be equitable and it's

40:45.080 --> 40:56.697
got to be as expeditiously applied as possible. 
The longer you wait, the less effective it is, and

40:57.638 --> 41:02.983
the harder it is to apply. It's got to be immediate, 
as immediate as possible. Now, if you were going to

41:07.567 --> 41:25.603
Texas A&M, and you were asked by the Commandant of 
the Corps to come and give a talk to these 18-, 19-,

41:07.567 --> 41:25.603
20-year-old corpsmen about how to become a 
leader,

41:07.567 --> 41:25.603
what would you say? I would think I'd probably 
outline in general, just like I've been talking to

41:25.904 --> 41:42.850
you, and then go back and expand on each one of the 
points and point out examples, and then summarize

41:25.904 --> 41:42.850
and recap again. And then point out people like 
Eisenhower and LeMay that were exemplary of these

41:42.870 --> 41:54.848
particular characteristics of leadership. In 
other words, try to improve on the values that

41:55.317 --> 41:59.121
you've already discussed. Right. I guess that's 
your...

42:06.430 --> 42:11.336
I guess the way I'm defining leadership for you is 
I've given you characteristics of a leader. In

42:12.057 --> 42:13.098
other words, these values. Sure. And who knows to 
say which one is number one and number two and three

42:14.740 --> 42:19.966
and four? I don't know. It depends on the 
particular circumstance where one might be more

42:20.467 --> 42:24.651
valuable. Sure. I tell you one that it's probably a 
little bit of a combination of the ones we've

42:25.405 --> 42:38.118
already mentioned in general, but you have an 
individual under you. Naturally, all of us have

42:38.138 --> 42:40.621
weaknesses and strengths. But you've got an 
individual you've got to use. And here again, it's

42:46.066 --> 42:49.850
like I went back to, it's partly this capability. 
Eisenhower, I think, had picked out the type of

42:49.910 --> 42:54.535
person he wanted to give the job. I dare say he had a 
certain job for that man that he wanted him to do

42:55.190 --> 43:02.176
when he picked him out, maybe a staff man or a 
commander. But to know as much as possible or at

43:02.777 --> 43:25.197
least have the capability to recognize by some 
means quickly the strengths and weaknesses of a

43:02.777 --> 43:25.197
man and to put him in a place where you use his 
strengths and his weaknesses, never have a chance

43:02.777 --> 43:25.197
to come to the surface and appear. If he's a cook, 
use him as a cook. If he's a mechanic, use him as a

43:32.059 --> 43:34.461
mechanic. If he's poor at budgeting and 
financing, don't put him in a finance area,

43:36.583 --> 43:42.870
accounting area, that type of thing. In other 
words, find out the skills of your men and then use

43:42.890 --> 43:48.215
them appropriately. I think this goes without 
saying, but sometimes we don't do it. And

43:51.619 --> 43:53.901
sometimes in the... bureaucracy of large 
organizations, you've often heard, geez, they

43:54.370 --> 44:00.876
trained me to do this, and look where they sent me. 
Now, I can understand. I've been to business with

44:02.457 --> 44:05.060
45,000 people under me. I can understand how this 
gets lost in the cracks. But generally speaking,

44:08.603 --> 44:21.195
the more a leader permits this to occur under his 
command, I think, well, the more he's asking for

44:08.603 --> 44:21.195
trouble. The more trouble he has, the poorer 
leader he is. a real leader, a real leader is not

44:24.880 --> 44:34.450
going to have a great deal of problems, 
particularly from the standpoint of morale and

44:24.880 --> 44:34.450
his outfit. And when he does, he has picked the 
proper people under him who he can delegate the

44:34.470 --> 44:41.457
responsibility to correct that problem. 
Therefore, he still has, a real leader can deal

44:41.758 --> 44:48.585
from red flags, always concentrating on where the 
problems are. He doesn't have to worry about the

44:48.605 --> 44:50.366
everyday thing. Sure. Just concentrate where the 
problems are. Sure. Okay, now, let's change the

44:54.412 --> 45:02.142
topic to A&M and the changes that have gone on at A&M 
in the last generation. From 1960 when we had 6,000

45:02.683 --> 45:08.130
or 5,000 students to today when we have 34,000. 
There have been a number of changes, not just

45:08.190 --> 45:18.223
growth and development from a college to a 
university, but a number of these things brought

45:08.190 --> 45:18.223
about in the 1960s. Women going to A&M for the first 
time, blacks going to A&M, the end of the mandatory

45:18.643 --> 45:23.710
core. And I'd like your opinion about these things 
and how they've changed A&M. First, let's start,

45:28.832 --> 45:32.477
though, by asking you, did you know General Earl 
Rutter? Who? Earl Rutter. Not personally. The

45:36.864 --> 45:37.325
president. I've just heard of him. Okay. What do 
you think about these changes? Let's start with

45:41.491 --> 45:49.444
ending what he did early in the 60s, ending the 
mandatory core and making it no longer...
