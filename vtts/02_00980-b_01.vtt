WEBVTT

00:02.174 --> 00:10.826
questions of this would have to be when, where were 
you when you heard the closing or the official

00:02.174 --> 00:10.826
closing? I was in Isfahan, Iran. And I was a, quote, 
civilian, unquote, instructor pilot working for

00:16.735 --> 00:29.132
Bell Helicopter International.

00:29.152 --> 00:31.776
We were training the Shah's Air Force.

00:34.591 --> 00:39.576
And as an aside to that, I used to believe I could 
teach a monkey to fly a helicopter if I had enough

00:34.591 --> 00:39.576
bananas. But after my trip to Iran, I don't believe 
that anymore. But I was in Isfahan the day it was

00:44.100 --> 00:50.486
announced that the war was officially over. And I 
can't remember exactly how I felt. I guess a little

00:56.671 --> 00:58.833
bit of everything. A little happy, a little sad, a 
little glad. Very cynical. Very simple.

01:09.806 --> 01:24.725
And it occurred to me that the night before I had had 
dinner at the Karush Hotel in Isfahan with two

01:09.806 --> 01:24.725
Russian mining engineers whose acquaintances I 
had made while I was there. That's when I began to

01:27.048 --> 01:31.834
not hate Russians and just hate Communists. He was 
a pretty nice guy. And they spoke pretty good

01:37.980 --> 01:40.423
English. They speak no Russian.

01:44.328 --> 01:46.311
But that's where I was at when it was announced. And 
a lot of us, you know, we were all, most of us,

01:46.531 --> 01:51.497
Vietnam veterans. And the gamut of comments were 
flying around the place.

02:00.129 --> 02:03.373
But I guess all of us were just a little bit relieved 
that it was finally over. And we were all sad

02:05.345 --> 02:08.608
because we knew we didn't win.

02:11.670 --> 02:13.352
It's hard for us to say we lost it. We never lost a 
battle. We just didn't win the war. But it wasn't

02:20.077 --> 02:22.920
our fault. But that's another subject.

02:26.663 --> 02:30.887
And I saw those two fine Russian gentlemen a few 
days later. And they were very polite. and not

02:35.281 --> 02:37.584
mentioning it. So I mentioned it. I said, did you 
hear the war is over? And it embarrassed me. And

02:45.336 --> 02:48.540
then we all laughed about it. And we went away.

02:52.065 --> 02:57.994
I don't think the fool in Normandy ever hit me for a 
couple of years.

02:58.014 --> 03:01.018
Until I knew it was finally ended.

03:04.443 --> 03:04.984
But over and never be over. On the ribbon we wear 
that was given to us by the Vietnamese government,

03:09.942 --> 03:20.859
a little green and white one, is called the Vietnam 
Campaign Medal. And there's a little bar on it that

03:22.201 --> 03:32.657
has a single date, 1960 until, and there's no other 
date. 1975 is not on there.

03:37.617 --> 03:38.778
And that pretty much says it. For a lot of us, in one 
degree or another, it will never be over. I've been

03:49.929 --> 03:52.031
very fortunate. I've come out of it. I know so many 
others. It's destroyed their lives. And it got to a

04:00.360 --> 04:03.523
certain point where they just couldn't recover.

04:06.794 --> 04:11.562
But it was finished in the spring of 1975. It was 
ended, but it's not

04:12.765 --> 04:17.653
over. But I'll never forget where I was at when I 
heard it. It was in a park hotel by the river in

04:20.478 --> 04:31.097
Isfahan, the religious capital of the Persian 
world.

04:35.330 --> 04:38.775
You were saying that it's not over.

04:41.560 --> 04:54.881
How do you feel that overall today, you know, how 
America's treated you and treats the Vietnam

04:41.560 --> 04:54.881
vets?

04:54.901 --> 04:56.884
I met a guy here several years ago. It was a disabled 
American veteran service officer with a DAV. He

05:04.372 --> 05:15.283
showed me some figures that absolutely astounded

05:04.372 --> 05:15.283
me. And I think about that,

05:15.303 --> 05:26.495
and it's really sad. 258,000 known suicides. 
Vietnam veterans. I mean, there were Clear cut, no

05:34.156 --> 05:37.460
doubt about it. One way or another, they did 
themselves in. Left a note, made it clear where. An

05:45.370 --> 05:52.319
additional 250,000 highly suspect deaths. The 
example he used to me was one that he had that was

05:52.339 --> 05:57.886
fairly indicative of his arrest. A guy had taken 
out a $100,000 insurance policy, double

06:02.624 --> 06:19.846
indemnity accident insurance policy, and three 
days later was killed in a single car accident on a

06:02.624 --> 06:19.846
clear day, stoned sober, and hit a bridge button at 
90 miles an hour. Left a wife and a couple of kids.

06:22.790 --> 06:26.435
Left them with 100 grand. Things like that. That's 
a half a million people.

06:31.936 --> 06:33.297
I'm fairly well pleased with it. It seemed to be a 
little patronizing at first, but thank God I got

06:34.238 --> 06:40.105
over that. The main thing was that these $258,000 
and then the additional $200,000,

06:42.067 --> 06:52.418
for them it's too little, too late.

06:55.882 --> 06:56.883
I mentioned patronized. I know a lot of people that 
feel like they're being patronized. And slowly

07:02.918 --> 07:06.942
but surely, hopefully they'll get over that. I 
felt it too, and I still see it from time to time. I

07:12.208 --> 07:19.695
know how to recognize it when I do see it, and I'm not 
very nice in my reaction to it. I respond to it very

07:19.715 --> 07:27.323
negatively, and I let the guilty individual know 
real quick that I don't like to be patronized.

07:29.918 --> 07:32.560
It's unfortunate that I don't have any control 
over that. I couldn't be a little bit more

07:32.721 --> 07:37.745
diplomatic about it because it really happens at 
the most inopportune times. I don't particularly

07:37.945 --> 07:40.528
care where I'm at or who I'm with. If I'm being 
patronized about that particular thing, I unload

07:40.608 --> 07:44.792
on them. I don't care who they are. I don't care what 
the consequences are. And that's not right

07:49.016 --> 07:51.278
either. And hopefully I'll get over that too and be 
a little bit more diplomatic about it and ignore

07:51.298 --> 07:58.204
the idiots when they do those things. But there's 
so many people still out there that, I don't know,

08:00.817 --> 08:05.823
they're swinging after the bell. They want 
something else to happen to make it all worth it. To

08:14.133 --> 08:16.236
make it valuable.

08:19.600 --> 08:28.811
And they've been burnt so long and so hard that

08:19.600 --> 08:28.811
the light just can't get through. On my own 
particular... back when they started talking

08:31.057 --> 08:36.404
about building the wall, the Vietnam Memorial. 
There was a hole in the ground. It was black and

08:41.151 --> 08:43.694
dark, ominous. I said, no, no good. But I look on it 
now, I've never been there. I want to go. I can't

08:51.845 --> 08:52.346
afford it. But I look on it now, and I hear what other 
guys have had to say about it, and it's right. It's

09:01.162 --> 09:03.084
perfect. Couldn't be any more perfect. When you 
look at the names on that wall and see your own face

09:06.589 --> 09:14.719
there.

09:14.739 --> 09:29.818
And like Mason said, the day they dedicated it, he 
saw his own face there and the rain was coming down

09:14.739 --> 09:29.818
and the droplets were running down the wall and he 
saw his face and the rain was like the wall had

09:14.739 --> 09:29.818
tears. And it was, it overwhelmed me. So it does 
seem to be perfect now. But back then when it first

09:37.804 --> 09:43.611
started, to me it was very pessimistic. I was very 
bitter. Very hard. Wouldn't talk about it.

09:50.559 --> 09:52.361
Wouldn't let anyone in my shell. Wouldn't 
forgive. Wouldn't lay it down. Didn't want to. I

10:01.473 --> 10:05.036
wanted to sit there and say, you owe me. You owe me 
big. But I got over that. I got through it. And I

10:14.644 --> 10:17.287
accept it. And when someone says to me now, thanks, 
Vietnam vet,

10:17.307 --> 10:25.634
I say, you're welcome. Because all any of us ever 
wanted was respect.

10:33.046 --> 10:40.013
respect that we love this country as much as 
anybody else does. That we were drawn into a thing

10:40.033 --> 10:55.289
that was bigger than any of us and without a control 
and no one,

10:40.033 --> 10:55.289
no one knew what to do about

10:40.033 --> 10:55.289
it. So I just say you're welcome. This is why I've 
let you interview me about this. Because I really

11:01.565 --> 11:09.517
believe now that the young people of your 
generation want to know. Oddly enough, I'm in the

11:11.080 --> 11:14.926
generation that's kind of on the fringe. I really 
shouldn't have been there. I was in my late 20s. I

11:20.194 --> 11:28.667
was 27 years old when I

11:20.194 --> 11:28.667
went to Vietnam. Thank you. 41 through 68. Yeah, 
27. On my 27th birthday. I was an old man.

11:38.682 --> 11:41.887
Even when I was in flight school, I was the second 
oldest one in the class. The other guy was 35. I was

11:43.450 --> 11:43.730
27. Everybody else was 19 and 20 and 21. We were the 
two old men. Pop and Grandpa, that's what they

11:48.738 --> 11:53.105
called us. I really shouldn't have been there. I 
didn't have to be there. People in my generation,

11:56.991 --> 11:58.453
most of them weren't.

12:04.913 --> 12:07.095
But it's that other generation. They're coming 
now. And your generation wants to know what

12:08.176 --> 12:11.039
happened to them. They want to know what happened 
to their moms and their dads. They want to know what

12:15.484 --> 12:17.385
happened to their Uncle Charlie.

12:20.348 --> 12:21.369
Why is he that way? What happened with Uncle 
Charlie? Why did my dad go away? Why did my dad come

12:27.375 --> 12:30.699
back? Why is my mom that way? They want to know.

12:36.740 --> 12:42.327
And it's up to us to tell you to pass it on. At least 
you be condemned to repeat the past. Don't do it.

12:50.076 --> 12:52.479
Don't let it happen again. There will be wars. 
That's going to happen. Nothing you're going to do

12:55.403 --> 12:58.847
is going to stop it. People have tried for 
generations, hundreds of generations, to stop a

12:58.867 --> 13:05.295
war, and all they've managed to do is interrupt. 
And that's nice. A little period of peace and

13:09.133 --> 13:13.037
prosperity off and on. But you're not going to stop 
on this side of the second coming. It will not

13:15.880 --> 13:18.342
happen. But you've got to have one. Do it right. Go 
out to win. Go all out. Call it total war. Call it

13:25.289 --> 13:26.270
whatever you want to. But make the enemy pay. Make 
it more costly for him to conduct a war than it is for

13:37.658 --> 13:39.960
you. It has a price. It's freedom that we enjoy. And 
the price is paid in blood, not dollars. That's why

13:49.529 --> 13:51.271
there's a red in that flag. That's what

13:51.291 --> 14:01.901
it's for. You're saying what you want to leave, I 
mean, as a note to the young people of the day, my

14:06.599 --> 14:11.785
generation, maybe even the generation after me. 
What else would you like to say to them? Like I said,

14:18.554 --> 14:30.508
your generation wants to know what happened to 
your dad's generation and mine from

14:18.554 --> 14:30.508
what. And I feel it incumbent upon me from time to 
time to tell you. Not to lecture you, but to teach

14:36.805 --> 14:41.510
you. I was deadly serious about my chosen way of 
life. I chose it when I was just but a child. My

14:48.697 --> 15:03.152
earliest memory is when I was four years old, 
standing on the railroad platform in

14:48.697 --> 15:03.152
Gainesville, Texas, during World War II, seeing 
an uncle of mine off to the battle in Europe on a

14:48.697 --> 15:03.152
troop train. The excitement of that day and what 
was going on the train soldiers and people and

15:07.653 --> 15:37.103
everybody proud and one thing or another and just 
the gamut of emotions marked my thinking and from

15:07.653 --> 15:37.103
that early age i wanted to be a soldier

15:07.653 --> 15:37.103
and i think it was planted in me before i was born so i 
was very very serious about my way of life well some

15:07.653 --> 15:37.103
people even think that i held the beliefs of the 
centuries and that would come home with your

15:38.450 --> 15:43.376
shield or on it. In fact, one dear friend of mine, a 
fellow pilot,

15:43.396 --> 16:01.038
he once described me as one who would be willing to 
die for an idea or with it. Steve was being cynical

16:01.058 --> 16:03.040
when he said, And he used to pick on me a lot about 
things like that, but I took it as a great

16:05.146 --> 16:11.293
compliment because he was right. He was 
absolutely right. My whole being has been that. To

16:18.721 --> 16:22.405
die for an idea or with it. This idea that we have 
about the liberties that we enjoy is something

16:22.485 --> 16:33.397
worth dying

16:22.485 --> 16:33.397
for. I once heard a man say, You've got to stand for 
something or you'll fall for anything. And that

16:41.469 --> 16:42.751
marked my thinking also. But I had to make choices 
like everybody does.

16:50.584 --> 16:56.773
And my whole upbringing was stand for something. 
Be counted on. You're one of many, but be that one.

17:03.504 --> 17:04.245
And don't back off. Be honest in your decisions. Be 
careful in your selection. But once you've made

17:12.882 --> 17:17.930
your choice, stand with it. If you're wrong, 
change it. If you're not, don't give up. Never,

17:24.520 --> 17:27.685
ever, ever give up.

17:34.330 --> 17:44.264
I sensed somewhere along the line that I really 
came to realize that I'd been betrayed by the very

17:34.330 --> 17:44.264
system that I was sworn to defend.

17:46.888 --> 17:54.098
And as I've said several times, I became very 
bitter and disillusioned about almost

17:46.888 --> 17:54.098
everything that I believed in. From literally 
from the Boy Scouts to God. I reached a point where I

18:03.288 --> 18:07.773
trusted absolutely nothing that was not of my own 
invention.

18:10.896 --> 18:14.541
Nothing.

18:14.561 --> 18:18.365
Only none of my inventions worked, whether they be 
physical or mental. They just didn't seem to work.

18:22.950 --> 18:29.397
I firmly believe, and I've got the evidence more 
than any man would need, the god that i believe in

18:31.030 --> 18:58.658
and his infinite mercy physically delivered me 
from the torment that i was going through and in

18:31.030 --> 18:58.658
doing so allowed me to begin to see glimpses of the 
truth of what happened the betrayal of honest men

18:31.030 --> 18:58.658
doing their duty as they've been taught by 
generations before them is beyond my ability to

18:31.030 --> 18:58.658
comprehend And I mentioned it a couple of times 
already, but it is so enormous, this betrayal.

19:08.777 --> 19:13.362
Vengeance can never wipe it

19:08.777 --> 19:13.362
out. Only forgiveness can clear away that stain.

19:19.449 --> 19:22.392
It must never happen again. And it is incumbent 
upon your generation to see to it that it doesn't.
