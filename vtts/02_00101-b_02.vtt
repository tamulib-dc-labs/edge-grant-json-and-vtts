WEBVTT

00:03.355 --> 00:07.942
The Saturday class stage, but there was a time I 
understand they had Saturday classes. And you

00:08.643 --> 00:11.827
didn't have a surplus of cash. Right. And you had 
maybe Saturday night and Sunday off. And so, you

00:17.976 --> 00:21.080
know, where do you go, you know? Occasionally, 
this was like my second year, my brother was at the

00:21.421 --> 00:25.567
University of Texas. He had been in the high school 
in the Marine Corps and he was a couple years older

00:26.588 --> 00:33.278
than I am. And then he went back to college and so he 
had kind of about caught up with me I guess. He was at

00:37.724 --> 00:45.115
the University of Texas and I used to go over and 
visit him, go to Austin.

00:46.056 --> 00:48.620
Okay, kind of some summary questions. As you look 
back on it, those years, what did A&M do well?

00:58.895 --> 01:00.497
Academically or anything else? Well, I think 
there were some good faculty members that taught

01:02.418 --> 01:13.397
classes and that spent a lot of time with students, 
or would, and would work with you about things. I

01:13.457 --> 01:15.861
like Harry Korder, who was English. 
K-R-O-I-T-O-R. Yeah, Korder. He's, I think, dead

01:18.886 --> 01:22.232
now. You know, he was, you know, helped me a lot in 
terms of writing. You know, in the sense he'd sit

01:28.839 --> 01:35.647
down and would work with you on, let's see what's 
wrong with this sentence type stuff. I don't know

01:35.687 --> 01:39.071
too many people how to do that today. Who else were 
there that you would, if you had them all around

01:39.091 --> 01:43.416
here now, you would thank? Well, you for one, and I 
think Corder, and Brown in sociology. What did I

01:50.263 --> 01:51.865
do? Well, I think just mentored, you know, a time 
like we knew you were going to be a veterinarian and

01:51.845 --> 01:59.423
is this the right choice? And, you know, you gave me 
a lot of encouragement about, in fact, I think when

01:59.584 --> 02:08.706
I took the Old South course, I wasn't yet, I was 
still in vet medicine. I took it as an elective, one

02:08.686 --> 02:14.357
of the electives that you could do, and it's just 
out of interest to Southern history, you know. And

02:15.058 --> 02:22.733
encouragement in the sense of papers that you'd 
written and other things like that. Political

02:24.236 --> 02:25.378
science, anybody? No, not really. I can say 
political science came kind of more at

02:27.469 --> 02:34.563
Midwestern, influence of various and sundry 
people. They had some really good young faculty

02:34.923 --> 02:39.912
members at Midwestern. You had, of course, 
Isabelle Hunt, who was something of a legend. But

02:43.499 --> 02:49.626
there was a guy, Hoffman, University of Chicago 
PhD, taught political theory. You had a guy, Moon,

02:51.488 --> 02:57.175
Korean, ended up at Arlington, who taught 
comparative government. Jim Wright, who was from

02:59.137 --> 03:02.220
Duke. Duke, yeah, Jim taught political theory. 
You had a guy, Hoffman, who taught American

03:04.263 --> 03:07.446
politics, Congress, and the presidency. And 
these were, you know, from 20 degrees, and these

03:08.027 --> 03:11.751
were good people. And very, you know, small 
classes, lots of class discussion, you know, lots

03:11.731 --> 03:23.608
of time on court cases, you know, constitutional 
law and civil liberties. So I think that was it. The

03:26.071 --> 03:38.869
history faculty, there were some interesting 
people there, but I think it retracted more to the

03:26.071 --> 03:38.869
people that were in political science as opposed 
to history.

03:39.946 --> 04:03.557
looking at it as objectively as possible what 
creates aggie spirit

03:39.946 --> 04:03.557
yeah i know i keep hearing this about the aggie 
family and aggie spirit and and you know i think

03:39.946 --> 04:03.557
it's not any one thing there's from the email i 
received you would think it was bonfire uh you know

03:39.946 --> 04:03.557
the you know but but really i think it may begin with 
fish camp which used to be a lot different deal than

04:03.537 --> 04:30.270
it is now it was a drawn out thing and i think they 
used to take them out to junction and stuff like

04:03.537 --> 04:30.270
that there's that there's there's the

04:03.537 --> 04:30.270
silver taps there's the the aggie lore the you know 
the the bullshit stories most of which probably

04:03.537 --> 04:30.270
aren't true Like you follow these people that give 
the campus tours, the guys that walk backwards.

04:34.194 --> 04:37.398
You ought to do that one time and listen to what, 
have you done that? You need to do it. They go by the

04:39.620 --> 04:41.562
academic building all the time. You can just 
probably, maybe go over and ask for a campus tour

04:41.602 --> 04:49.331
when you could do one and don't tell them who you are 
and you'll find out some interesting things. The

04:49.371 --> 04:54.616
tree in front of Bolton Hall was planted by the 
first class of Aggies at Texas A&M. Did you know

04:54.877 --> 04:56.038
that? Not in 1913, as the photographs show. Do you 
know why they stopped polishing the dome on the

04:59.645 --> 05:04.154
academic building? Because it was blinding the 
pilots and they landed at Easterwood Airport. I

05:10.065 --> 05:12.490
mean, there's just these amazing things. I mean, 
they're just ludicrous. All of the logs at Bonfire

05:14.554 --> 05:17.520
are cut with axes. I mean, it just goes on and on. So 
there's all this mythology. It's almost like the

05:21.552 --> 05:24.036
Texas mythology. You can make a point that the 
people at the Alamo were idiots. Not heroes, but

05:28.083 --> 05:29.825
idiots. There wasn't any way they were going to 
beat Napoleon's army. with the damn Kentucky long

05:33.852 --> 05:38.402
rifles and a couple of cannons. But there's this 
myth, and there's a lot of that at A&M. And all of

05:44.194 --> 05:46.058
that, I think, adds to it. And lightly, the idea 
that you're an Aggie because you're special in the

05:46.539 --> 05:53.413
sense that you can get into A&M. And that makes you 
special. Not everybody can get accepted. That

05:56.912 --> 05:58.355
wasn't true back then, I think. They gave you the 
Aggie, you know, which hands are yours.

06:06.434 --> 06:11.385
Are there some other events that you haven't 
mentioned that you think add to that spirit? Well,

06:11.365 --> 06:23.406
the band, the music, the songs, the yells, the core 
trips, all of those things at least at that point

06:11.365 --> 06:23.406
added to the kind of Aggie camaraderie. And of 
course there was a lot of, everybody's out in the

06:23.826 --> 06:34.605
hall sitting up against the wall with their knees 
drawn up and the company commanders marching up

06:23.826 --> 06:34.605
and down the hall. And you're talking about what 
good Aggies do and what bad Aggies, you know, do and

06:34.872 --> 06:42.222
so on, that kind of stuff, you know. Why did you come 
to A&M? We got a fight in Texas Aggie. You didn't get

06:46.748 --> 06:47.950
ready to get an education. That's the other 
education. And you know, Haskell, judging by the

06:50.594 --> 06:59.306
email messages that I got on Bonfire, these people 
got the other education because they can't spell,

06:50.594 --> 06:59.306
they can't write, and they can't think.

07:02.350 --> 07:04.052
All right, what did you do? What special

07:04.336 --> 07:10.226
things did you get out of being here two years? What 
did it mean to you to have been here two years? I

07:16.456 --> 07:20.103
don't know whether anything particularly 
special. Well, it must have been something

07:20.603 --> 07:25.692
because you didn't turn down a job opportunity. 
You could have gone somewhere else. Right, but I

07:28.096 --> 07:33.243
think that was more a matter of a number of things, 
why you accepted the job. And it was, you know, pay.

07:39.132 --> 07:42.837
It was resources that they were willing to give 
you. It was Gibbons, who was a very dynamic sort of

07:42.877 --> 07:50.188
individual, you know. the colleagues that you 
were going to be with, that group of four that

07:50.168 --> 08:03.410
recruited you, those kinds of things that 
overcome the sort of negative feelings that you

07:50.168 --> 08:03.410
had. There was also a lot of repression of any sort 
of thought out of the ordinary. I still remember

08:11.443 --> 08:14.488
where

08:15.413 --> 08:24.708
You know, there was a case of somebody who didn't 
get into who's who, and of course somebody

08:15.413 --> 08:24.708
overrode the committee's decision. And the 
battalion wrote an essay entitled, you know, 49

08:24.748 --> 08:35.145
Who's Who and One Who's He, and all hell broke 
loose. You know, the battalion editor got fired

08:35.165 --> 08:39.312
back when they could do those kinds of things over. 
Basically telling the truth that some dean

08:39.292 --> 08:46.147
exercised political influence to get this guy. He 
was somebody who was in the corps, on corps staff,

08:46.828 --> 08:58.313
but he was really kind of a guy that was disliked by a 
lot of people, which is why he didn't get who's

08:46.828 --> 08:58.313
who. Let's see. Two other questions then.

09:05.223 --> 09:14.011
Let's make believe somebody walks up to you and 
gives you a million-dollar check that has only one

09:05.223 --> 09:14.011
specific requirement. You must pass it on to Texas 
A&M, but you can decide the use that A&M would make

09:14.031 --> 09:20.398
for that money. If you could make a big, meaningful 
gift, what would it be for? Undergraduate

09:27.024 --> 09:28.165
scholarship. for what How would the, who, what 
undergraduates? Well, I might pick political

09:34.500 --> 09:38.625
science instead of liberal arts. How would you 
select the specific ones? I don't know that I would

09:42.090 --> 09:44.073
want to do that. No, but you'd have the university 
select them on the basis of what? On the basis of

09:47.597 --> 09:50.241
merit and need. Merit and need. Okay. All right. 
Then the last question is a serious one. What

09:57.090 --> 09:59.974
feelings do you hold in your heart for Texas A&M? I 
think, you know, about it. There are aspects of it

10:03.638 --> 10:21.659
that, you know, you say it really could be a great 
university, but it really could meet the 2020

10:03.638 --> 10:21.659
vision, but I don't think it's going to, unless 
somebody begins to take that bonfire report

10:03.638 --> 10:21.659
seriously. I think that was very devastating to, 
or it should be viewed as being very devastating

10:27.950 --> 10:29.552
the people in charge of this place. But I haven't 
heard anybody say or haven't heard anyone ask, and

10:29.993 --> 10:41.972
maybe they will, you know, what can we do to address 
that problem among the students at Texas A&M

10:29.993 --> 10:41.972
University and among the administration? It's 
not just confined to the students. I have a lot of it

10:44.275 --> 10:46.178
in the administration. And some of that's because 
over the years you keep hiring, you know, your

10:46.158 --> 10:55.130
graduates to come back, you know, bachelor, 
master, Ph.D., you know, retired. I mean, look at

10:56.231 --> 11:01.398
engineering, the degree to which that's true, 
agriculture, the degree to which that's true.

11:02.039 --> 11:06.124
And, you know, that ought to be something that 
somebody really ought to be concerned with. And

11:06.885 --> 11:11.271
maybe, you know, I admit Bowen's been very tied up 
with We're just getting, you know, to this point.

11:14.615 --> 11:16.597
And obviously he must have made the right 
decision. He made both sides mad. And I respect, I

11:18.899 --> 11:22.503
think what he did was the right thing. I might have 
gone another year without Bonfire. But at some

11:26.627 --> 11:28.929
point maybe he will address that issue. We, 
Faculty Senate Executive Committee asked to meet

11:28.989 --> 11:37.438
with him at some point and we want to talk about that 
aspect of it. And how do you address the change of

11:37.458 --> 11:39.520
culture? I don't know. What's going on?
