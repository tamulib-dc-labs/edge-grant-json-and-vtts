WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:16.059
on the campus as a youngster, for you and your 
friends, did it matter what the job status of your

00:02.545 --> 00:16.059
parents was when you were at A&M-Solidarity? I 
doubt if most of us even knew what our parents did or

00:16.340 --> 00:22.747
what the parents of our friends did. We knew they 
were teachers, connected with the college, being

00:23.047 --> 00:32.417
paid with the college, but no, it didn't make any 
difference. And I'm assuming that there was

00:33.528 --> 00:41.879
comparative continuity in those friendships 
because there was a comparatively stable...

00:42.140 --> 00:43.101
Right, right. I mean, they'd come here. I mean, so 
many came here, and from whatever point they were

00:45.825 --> 01:00.244
at, when they came, they proceeded until they 
generally either graduated from A&M or went off

00:45.825 --> 01:00.244
someplace else. All right, now you enrolled at A&M 
as a freshman in the fall of? In the summer of 1944. I

01:08.374 --> 01:14.820
graduated from high school on Friday night and 
enrolled at A&M on Monday. That was when we were on

01:15.461 --> 01:17.683
the trimester during the war. Okay, all right. 
And, oh, well, let's back up a little bit. How did,

01:23.488 --> 01:30.535
describe the changes that you recall at A&M after 
Pearl Harbor? Well, let's see.

01:38.621 --> 02:02.833
First thing, after Pearl Harbor, the whole class 
of 1942, I believe it was, 41 or 42,

01:38.621 --> 02:02.833
left en masse and went, I think, I may not be exactly 
right, but it seemed to me like they went to San

01:38.621 --> 02:02.833
Antonio as a group and were inducted and then came 
back and finished the year and then went in the

02:03.775 --> 02:10.784
service. I believe, I don't think that's correct. 
And from then on until the war was over the student

02:13.107 --> 02:30.930
body just became fewer in number and more and more 
military units were taking their place. When I

02:31.383 --> 02:39.592
entered A&M in 1944, there were less than 2,000 
students in A&M. There were probably 6,000 or

02:40.514 --> 02:50.345
8,000

02:40.514 --> 02:50.345
people on campus, but the rest of them were Navy or 
Marine or Army. Was it V12 or something? Where did

02:55.331 --> 02:56.232
they live? They lived in the core area. It was not a 
core area. And the A&M students lived in the old

03:00.188 --> 03:04.794
arms. Over on the north side? On the north side. 
Back to Pearl Harbor for a second. Do you remember

03:10.921 --> 03:13.785
hearing that news? I was at the campus theater on 
Sunday afternoon. They stopped the movie and said

03:19.212 --> 03:27.822
that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. Of 
course, most of us didn't have a clue. I was only

03:30.445 --> 03:35.894
about 15 years old at the time. And the one thing I 
remember my folks said, my mother said, well,

03:36.775 --> 03:47.212
she's glad that I was not old enough to have to go in 
this service. At the time, I got to be 18.

03:52.973 --> 03:55.036
I was playing football that fall. My birthday's in 
October. And

03:57.860 --> 04:03.588
we played out the season. We played University of 
Texas on Thanksgiving. And then on Monday, we got

04:06.793 --> 04:15.746
on the train and drove the train down to Miami and 
played University of Miami. And when I got back

04:15.766 --> 04:21.394
from that trip, my dad handed me my draft notice. 
And he had come before Thanksgiving, but he got it

04:22.184 --> 04:34.299
in the mail and held it until the season was over. 
And I guess if he had come before Thanksgiving, it

04:34.319 --> 04:45.373
didn't take about a month or six weeks at the most 
from the time I turned 18. until the time I was

04:45.995 --> 04:47.277
drafted. And nearly everybody's in the same boat. 
As soon as you turned 18, you were gone. All right,

04:53.365 --> 04:56.770
were you deferred? No, I wasn't deferred. The 
university or the college said that if you're

05:02.558 --> 05:07.024
drafted, Any courses that you were passing at the 
time, you got credit for them without finishing

05:07.882 --> 05:14.072
the semester. So then you go on active duty when? 
Well, I went on active duty in January of 1945. All

05:22.485 --> 05:25.510
right, so let's go back. So you're here from the 
summer of? Summer of 1944 through January of 1945.

05:35.354 --> 05:43.263
The football team that fall that you were with, 
were most of them freshmen and sophomores? Really

05:43.283 --> 05:47.027
a large majority were freshmen. There were a few 
sophomores. The year before was the Kiddie Corps

05:50.070 --> 05:58.379
team that was nearly all 17 year olds. And we had two 
or three guys, Bullet Gray that I mentioned, and

06:00.329 --> 06:09.137
Bob Buchovsky, and Monty Mongrief, that were 
veterinary students. And they had gotten

06:10.318 --> 06:11.519
deferred? They were deferred in order to finish 
veterinary school. And we had three or four, I

06:15.042 --> 06:21.067
can't remember, at least three. And then we had two 
or three guys that did discharge for one reason or

06:21.087 --> 06:29.374
another and came back. And

06:29.962 --> 06:44.301
then there were some that had played the year 
before that evidently were so young that they were

06:29.962 --> 06:44.301
able to make it through their sophomore year. But 
nearly all of us, nearly all of us, before the war

06:45.142 --> 06:52.712
was over, we called into service. I'm not going to 
ask you who, if there is an answer to this question.

06:57.468 --> 07:04.176
Did you know of any person, were you acquainted 
with anybody, who attempted to evade?

07:07.239 --> 07:08.621
That's my memory, too. I don't know of anybody. I'm 
sure there were some, but those guys that were in

07:11.063 --> 07:25.720
vet school, veterinary medicine school, I don't 
think they were evaded. in vet school because most

07:25.902 --> 07:30.308
of them were seniors. And they would have had to 
anticipate.

07:38.320 --> 07:41.604
Where did you live that summer and fall? I lived at 
home. Oh, you lived at home. And you took full load

07:44.869 --> 07:47.092
academically. What was your major? It was 
undeclared at the time.

07:55.283 --> 07:57.866
I guess pretty much all took the same thing. Nearly 
all of my classes,

07:58.887 --> 08:07.539
the role was alphabetical. A's through C's were in 
there. I was with that group nearly all the way.

08:14.428 --> 08:17.471
Aren't you in your reported active duty when? 
January. and you left by the train on bus bus we were

08:19.649 --> 08:47.580
reported to the draft office in dubai and we got on 
the bus we went to houston we were inducted in

08:19.649 --> 08:47.580
houston the coach on the train and sent us to san 
antonio one interested that was one of the guys

08:19.649 --> 08:47.580
that i met the morning that we reported for the 
draft was a a guy that had graduated from Bryan High

08:48.168 --> 08:52.792
School. His name's Ray Copas. I don't know if you 
know Ray or not, but anyway, we rode the bus

08:54.594 --> 09:03.081
together down to Houston. They shipped us to

09:03.101 --> 09:10.888
Fort Hood, Camp Hood. We were in the same platoon. 
In fact, in the same squad. My name's Cash, and his

09:14.872 --> 09:18.175
name was Copas, and we were close enough We were in 
the same squad in basic training. When the war in

09:22.038 --> 09:29.586
Europe was over, they said that 18-year-olds had 
to be in the service six months. And so they sent us

09:29.606 --> 09:36.114
down to Camp

09:29.606 --> 09:36.114
Rucker, Alabama. And we stayed down there until 
August of 1945. And they shipped us to Fort Ord. And

09:48.108 --> 09:58.338
we were on the ship two days out of Fort Ord when they 
dropped the atom bomb. How did you hear about that?

10:02.062 --> 10:02.843
I don't know. They just started talking about it. 
Because the war was over by the time we got

10:04.685 --> 10:07.087
overseas. How did you guys react when you heard the 
war was over? Well, you know, there wasn't much we

10:09.910 --> 10:14.675
could do except just holler and hoot. But Ray and I, 
Staying together, they shipped us to the

10:17.133 --> 10:25.041
Philippines, and from the Philippines to Korea. 
We were in Korea a year, and they shipped us home.

10:29.366 --> 10:34.131
And we rode the bus from San Antonio to Dubai to get 
to America. So we were roommates the whole time we

10:34.452 --> 10:37.675
were in Korea. Ray, after we both went back in the 
Corps, when we got back in there and got our

10:38.316 --> 10:46.144
commissions, when the Korean War started about 10 
days after I graduated. But we were already

10:54.366 --> 10:57.491
committed to two years. But he transferred his 
commission to the Air Force and made a career. I got

11:06.763 --> 11:08.165
out quick as I could. His last duty station was A&M. 
and

11:12.314 --> 11:21.348
he retired here and we played golf together three 
days a week. Back before you leave, the first time,

11:21.468 --> 11:31.944
do you remember anything said by your parents the 
night before or as you go to the bus or anything? I

11:34.287 --> 11:39.435
remember

11:34.287 --> 11:39.435
my parents were strangely

11:40.917 --> 11:46.286
quiet. They didn't say much. I remember the 
morning that we got up early, they had to be over

11:47.548 --> 11:56.743
there at 6 o'clock or something.

11:56.763 --> 12:02.111
But it was a whole lot more traumatic for them than 
it was for me, I'm sure. I didn't much care. Let's

12:05.377 --> 12:07.380
see, other things. Do you remember where you were 
when you heard that President Roosevelt had died?

12:12.825 --> 12:13.546
No.

12:17.410 --> 12:18.371
Let's see. That was in, what, April of 45? Mm-hmm. I 
was in Fort Wood. I was in basic training in Fort

12:24.236 --> 12:30.483
Wood. I don't remember my reaction much. I was in 
the shower, spring training in high school. Oh,

12:36.489 --> 12:36.709
really? And we thought some guy was trying to play a 
joke. And we said, hey, that's not funny. And he

12:41.426 --> 12:42.647
said, no, it's the truth. When I got home, I 
realized I hadn't even dried off. I put my clothes

12:46.131 --> 12:48.273
on, wet. And all the way home, we were talking 
about, wonder who the president will be, because

12:48.933 --> 12:55.760
President Roosevelt had been the only president 
we could remember. Yeah. But I don't remember much

12:57.922 --> 13:04.148
reaction.

13:04.364 --> 13:29.754
I do remember

13:04.364 --> 13:29.754
we were on our way from Camp Rucker to Fort Howard on 
the train when we heard that they had stopped gas

13:04.364 --> 13:29.754
racing. And I remember that because all during the 
time we were in high school. We got four gallons of

13:34.132 --> 13:39.319
gas a week, and we couldn't do much, you know, four 
gallons. All right, so you get back to A&M in the

13:40.760 --> 13:44.665
fall of 46? 46, yeah. Describe A&M then. Then it was 
bustling, man. And the strange thing was to see so

13:55.279 --> 14:02.107
many people not in uniform. Because, you know, to 
me, you're an Aggie, you wore a uniform. And when we

14:07.183 --> 14:13.071
got back, why, most of the guys were not in the 
Corps. There were more veterans here than there

14:13.091 --> 14:17.237
were non-veterans. And there was a distinct gap 
between the veterans and non-veterans.

14:24.246 --> 14:32.237
Age-wise, motivation-wise,

14:24.246 --> 14:32.237
a lot of them were married. It was just, I mean, it 
was Two camps all together. All right. Now, did you

14:36.649 --> 14:38.531
go back into the Corps? Yeah, I went back into the 
Corps. I went one semester. Taylor Wilkins was the

14:43.897 --> 14:48.182
veterans advisor. And he got to be good buddies 
with a whole bunch of us college kids and bride

14:48.202 --> 14:56.312
kids. I'm not sure exactly why or who started it. I 
think Ellie Wynder won it. But anyway, Taylor

15:04.582 --> 15:11.929
Whitman had a big influence on us, and he taught 
several of us. He just said, you're going to be

15:11.949 --> 15:15.813
sorry if you get your permission. So we got back in 
the Corps, and because of the extra hours that we

15:15.833 --> 15:32.209
had to take in order to finish our military, it cost 
me extra semesters. So instead of graduating in

15:33.202 --> 15:48.419
January of 1950,

15:33.202 --> 15:48.419
I graduated

15:33.202 --> 15:48.419
in June. So you go back in the Corps as a sophomore? 
Well, no, I went back and we got credit for the first

15:52.003 --> 15:56.909
two years. Oh, first two years, okay. Because we 
were in the service. So I went back in. under

16:02.513 --> 16:30.613
contract okay uh and did where did you live then 
about here so you lived at home all four years right

16:02.513 --> 16:30.613
uh about uh where were where was this big crowd of 
students living well of course the the dorms were

16:02.513 --> 16:30.613
all full and then they built they built was the 
college view you know you know the they moved the

16:30.796 --> 16:33.300
barracks and built for the marriage students. And 
then the all the project houses have been

16:33.701 --> 16:40.691
converted to marriage student quarters. Were 
there some house trailers also? Oh yeah, I was just

16:42.995 --> 16:57.698
in addition to the project houses, the whole area 
that's now the parking lot for the stadium and for

16:42.995 --> 16:57.698
the tennis courts, it was all But it was all on the 
east side of the Weldron Road.

17:08.161 --> 17:14.711
There were a few houses right immediately beyond 
the Weldron Road. They had been there. People that

17:16.354 --> 17:21.181
worked on the A&M Farms and so on lived in them. And 
I'm not sure. There may have been some students

17:21.902 --> 17:25.147
living in some of those. But they lived just about 
everywhere. I don't know where they could find

17:28.087 --> 17:30.951
that place. All right. Describe, compare the 
attitude you had as a student when you came back

17:31.531 --> 17:40.963
with the attitude you had when you first began. 
Well, when I first began, I mean, the uppermost

17:41.524 --> 17:52.378
thing in my mind was . Except my dad, I mean, He said, 
if you don't make your grades, you can't play. And

18:01.611 --> 18:05.335
he was paying the bill at that point. I remember 
Coach Norton asked me if I was going to play

18:05.355 --> 18:12.101
football that summer. And I said, no, I didn't 
think I was. And he wondered why. And I said, well, I

18:18.028 --> 18:19.769
didn't think I was big enough. He said, well, 
you've got a uniform that'll fit you. It's not for

18:24.554 --> 18:26.376
you to come out. That's what I wanted to do, you 
know. And so I went out for football, and there were

18:29.802 --> 18:37.812
about 100 of us or so that went out for football. And 
it was just like high school. Anybody wanted to

18:39.454 --> 18:40.455
play. And there were a few guys on scholarship. So 
in today's terminology, that first fall, you were

18:43.179 --> 18:47.605
a walk-on back in 44. I walked on. And I remember 
that they, I'm sure the guys that were on

18:50.088 --> 18:56.937
scholarship, I didn't know what a scholarship 
was. I never even heard of a scholarship. But the

19:00.964 --> 19:04.869
ones that were on scholarship, they practiced. 
When we first started that summer, they were

19:05.029 --> 19:13.519
practicing on the practice field that was right by 
the stadium. I was way over at the baseball

19:13.539 --> 19:18.205
field. And I don't even remember who was coaching 
us, because they only had three or four coaches.

19:25.165 --> 19:31.170
And I don't know who was even coaching us, but I kept 
getting moved up, moved up. And finally, by the

19:31.190 --> 19:35.935
time the first game came around, I was starting. So 
you, as a walk-on, were a starter. First game. And

19:41.280 --> 19:42.321
you weighed about how much? 150. What was your 
position? Quarterback. Quarterback. And you all

19:46.845 --> 19:47.926
were running the? We were running the T formation. 
The first time we started everybody. I think he

19:53.591 --> 19:54.852
just played. He was just having an enjoyable time 
trying something new. In the lingo of that day, it

20:01.793 --> 20:07.318
was the tight tee, not the splint. Then when you 
come back... When we came back... Back to this

20:09.580 --> 20:13.344
attitude.

20:15.986 --> 20:24.214
Well, I still want to play football, and that 
didn't change until... We played LSU. My

20:26.475 --> 20:27.996
sophomore year, I broke my leg. And after that, 
football wasn't near as important. All I could

20:33.743 --> 20:36.206
think about was getting out. And I wanted to coach. 
And I just wanted to get through the school and get

20:39.490 --> 20:43.615
going. Well, then when I got through the school, 
the war started and they called me back in the

20:43.635 --> 20:48.581
service. And so I went back in the service. when I 
got back out two years later and back and that

20:54.738 --> 21:16.170
Taylor Wilkins gave me a job as a military 
counselor said I could work on my master's degree

20:54.738 --> 21:16.170
as soon as I got it well I went to West Texas and 
started coaching. And that you began coaching

21:16.270 --> 21:18.433
what year?

21:24.202 --> 21:51.981
all right uh let's go back to the when you come back 
in 46. uh you had to declare a major somewhere along

21:24.202 --> 21:51.981
the way what well i physical education because i 
definitely i wanted to coach that's what i want to

21:24.202 --> 21:51.981
do as you now look back on all of those 
undergraduate years who were the key teachers or

21:24.202 --> 21:51.981
advisors or counselors that made a difference 
there was uh There was a biology prof. Let

21:52.552 --> 22:05.586
me see what his name was. I didn't think I'd ever 
forget his name. Anyway, he taught anatomy and

22:08.048 --> 22:11.832
physiology. And most of us that were in the class 
were PE majors.

22:19.990 --> 22:25.056
But he did the best job teaching. I'm just getting 
material across to him. And he was so patient with

22:29.622 --> 22:32.165
us, you know. And I just, I thought he was one of the 
best professors I ever had. Dr. Keel was an English

22:40.977 --> 22:46.624
teacher,

22:40.977 --> 22:46.624
I believe. And I thought a lot of him. What was the 
history teacher that went to East Texas? Ralph

22:56.308 --> 22:56.909
Steen. Ralph Steen. I thought he was marvelous. 
What made him so good? He was just entertaining.

23:08.622 --> 23:12.927
I had his class Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday at 8 
o'clock. And I never missed it. Because I just

23:15.790 --> 23:17.892
enjoyed learning it. He made Texas history 
something beside dates. I'm surprised to hear you

23:22.410 --> 23:26.575
say that about him.

23:27.917 --> 23:32.782
He'd come in in the morning and all he'd have was his 
grade book. And he'd check the roll and then he'd

23:32.802 --> 23:44.516
start talking and he'd refer to a passage that he 
had assigned or something.

23:44.536 --> 23:45.257
Let's see. Another teacher that made a... impact 
on me, but it was negative, was

23:48.263 --> 24:00.676
Square Root Jackson. Did you ever have Square 
Root? No, but I heard the legend that he was hard,

24:01.657 --> 24:06.522
hard to pass. Well, he did so many, he was such a 
mathematician, I suppose, that he never could get

24:07.263 --> 24:17.173
on the especially at first year algebra. I was 
taking trig under him. And up until that point, I'd

24:23.406 --> 24:28.611
never made anything but an A in math. And I remember 
we got, I was just barely hanging on by the skin of my

24:28.631 --> 24:42.746
teeth when we left to go to Miami at Thanksgiving. 
And he would come in and he would say, okay open your

24:47.748 --> 25:13.688
book to sudden sets we're gonna work these 
problems and he'd like that i mean he had the book

24:47.748 --> 25:13.688
memorized he didn't even look at the book he'd 
write the problems on the board and he'd work them

24:47.748 --> 25:13.688
so fast and he was with no explanation and i was i was 
really i was really thinking about being a math

24:47.748 --> 25:13.688
teacher until that one semester with him

25:14.545 --> 25:18.470
He just destroyed my confidence as far as math's 
concerned. I still would like to be a math teacher.

25:20.393 --> 25:26.761
If I had to do over, that's what I'd teach.

25:26.781 --> 25:33.010
I wish I could think of that man's name, though, 
because he taught biology here for a long time. Any

25:33.531 --> 25:37.236
non-instructional counselors, advisors? Well, 
we always thought a lot of Spike White. What did

25:41.962 --> 25:43.123
Spike do? Spike was... Well, at one point he ran a 
mural program. And then he was director of student

25:48.441 --> 25:56.911
services or something. I'm not sure what it was. He 
was just a friend. Kind of like Mr. Penny Pembroke.

26:04.079 --> 26:09.865
There were so many of those guys that were here 
before I left. that were my dad's peers. And

26:15.109 --> 26:29.067
because of that relationship, I had a special 
relationship with Dr. Gammon and Mr. Penberthy

26:15.109 --> 26:29.067
and Dean Bolton and Gib Gilchrist. They were 
family friends as well as professional friends.

26:34.794 --> 26:39.700
And you couldn't keep from being influenced by 
those people. And I'm assuming also that was a

26:40.523 --> 26:46.148
pretty good restraint on any kind of... There was 
no thought of, you know, of trying to get by with

26:46.308 --> 26:50.632
something. Of mischief. Because you weren't 
going to. I mean, it was just... You know, I've

26:53.154 --> 27:04.944
often thought that maybe I'd have been a whole lot 
better off down the line if I'd gone off someplace

26:53.154 --> 27:04.944
else. And, you know, you never know. You can't 
second guess, but... Now you, when you came back

27:10.223 --> 27:17.173
after the war, were you on scholarship and the GI 
Bill? I was on scholarship and the GI Bill and a

27:17.914 --> 27:22.199
military contract. Okay. Oh, you had some money 
then. I had more money, more money to spend my last

27:25.784 --> 27:34.416
two years in Indiana than I've ever had since. Did 
you live at home? I lived at home and my scholarship

27:39.620 --> 27:41.802
was a check for $60 a month. OK. Now I'm thinking 
about the parental changes. How did your mother

27:47.929 --> 27:59.441
and dad differ, if they did, in the advice and 
counsel they gave you after the war before? Well,

28:00.142 --> 28:07.129
they pretty much left me alone, as far as They 
didn't look down my throat or anything like that.

28:10.437 --> 28:13.422
But I knew that they were there. And I wasn't going 
to do anything that would discredit them. You had a

28:21.955 --> 28:22.676
car. Well, I did the last year. The last year. You 
couldn't buy a car. Oh, that's right. Sure. You

28:29.926 --> 28:30.708
couldn't buy a car. So I got my name on the list. And 
just before my senior year,

28:38.783 --> 28:49.796
My

28:38.783 --> 28:49.796
aunt that lived across the street had, she had her 
name on the list up at Will's Point all during the

28:38.783 --> 28:49.796
war. Well, her name came up and she said, well, you 
can buy that parking lot. I had saved enough money

28:55.203 --> 28:59.648
from- What kind of car was it? 1948 Chevrolet, two 
door. How long did you keep it? I kept it until 1950.

29:05.696 --> 29:07.778
I swapped it for a Buick. Remember what you paid for 
it? I paid $1,400. Wow. Cash. Yeah. Now, after you

29:16.215 --> 29:19.699
hurt your leg, did you play? I hurt my leg, I think it 
was the fourth game my sophomore year. So I had to

29:27.285 --> 29:28.947
finish layout that year. And then I

29:30.128 --> 29:34.932
had gained so much weight. I never was the fastest 
guy in the world. And so after I came back, I never

29:38.386 --> 29:40.970
couldn't run much. And I played two more years. But 
it was just kind of off and on. And my attitude

29:48.201 --> 29:54.250
wasn't as good as it should have been as far as it 
wasn't the same. I'll put it that way. And I got

29:56.173 --> 30:03.604
caught up like everybody else that was in my 
situation. There was a the coaching staff was

30:07.310 --> 30:11.536
trying to recruit the young guys and they brought 
them in. We had Glenn Lipman and that bunch that

30:12.217 --> 30:18.766
were freshmen, my junior year. And there was, if 
they treated everybody like veterans, the

30:18.786 --> 30:27.698
freshmen weren't getting what they needed. And if 
they treated us like incoming freshmen, there was

30:27.718 --> 30:34.307
just a big gap between them. And so, It was really a 
trying time as far as athletics is concerned.

30:43.121 --> 30:48.309
Coach Norton is here through your... Sophomore 
year. Sophomore year. I played for... Steitler?

30:52.355 --> 30:53.877
Steitler. Describe Coach Norton as a coach, as a 
person. Well, Coach Norton was my eye as far as

30:57.042 --> 31:04.333
coaching was concerned, you know. And he and 
Manning Smith, Manning Smith was the backfield

31:04.752 --> 31:12.642
coach. And from the time I began to move up far 
enough where there was a chance that I might get the

31:12.662 --> 31:32.886
play, I spent an hour or so every day at this coach's 
office with the other guys that were going to be

31:12.662 --> 31:32.886
quarterbacks.
