WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:05.154
Well, first of all, what's your name? Me? Yes. 
Secundino. Secundino Vaca. And where in Mexico

00:10.723 --> 00:13.007
were you born? In the state of Guanajuato. In which 
town? On one side of Salamanca, on the coast of

00:17.434 --> 00:22.903
Salamanca. In town or ranch? In a ranch, just over 
there. It's like everybody said, the brine in

00:28.145 --> 00:35.333
here, the bottom, or something like that. It's not 
the same there. It's the same condo. It's like

00:42.921 --> 00:48.167
here, the bottom, you know. Anybody can say that 
brine. Was it near a river? Is your ranch near a

00:54.217 --> 00:57.480
river? Yes. What is the name of that river?

01:04.047 --> 01:05.089
Nassos.

01:08.032 --> 01:08.752
The river Nassos. I went through the river. I went 
through the bridge. Now when I wanted to fix my

01:18.383 --> 01:22.587
papers for my passport, They said that there was no 
record of anyone there. That there was nothing

01:28.932 --> 01:31.896
there. Well, since I've been here for many years, 
since I passed my passport and settled it. And from

01:39.365 --> 01:43.510
there, when I came from... When I came from over 
there, I was in Fort Worth. Fort Worth lasted eight

01:48.035 --> 01:51.780
days, and in eight days I walked back again. When 
you came here? When you

01:59.024 --> 02:06.435
first came here? Yeah, when I first came here. Then 
just, I think

02:09.780 --> 02:18.173
it's close, but in August, in September, I don't 
know, I don't remember so good, but one of those

02:19.773 --> 02:26.582
months. Then, but, you know, last January, yes, 
that's when I get a lot of work, because I have no

02:26.602 --> 02:42.461
time to spend, but, you know, I was just working 
from 4 o'clock to work. And then I stayed eight

02:43.663 --> 02:49.290
days, and then eight days, on some kind of camp, 
make work, you see. And then... In qué año? 1921.

02:58.849 --> 02:59.489
1921. Y en qué año venía a los Estados Unidos en 
primero? In 1920.

03:10.400 --> 03:10.560
Mm-hmm. Y para qué razón? Hmm? Para qué razón? Why 
did you come here? Yo para trabajar aquí. Was

03:20.759 --> 03:48.724
it

03:20.759 --> 03:48.724
like that then? Yeah. In 1920? 1921. But they

03:52.277 --> 04:01.709
didn't find a record there, too. Because I wanted 
some kind of record, but at that time, until 1930, I

04:01.729 --> 04:14.325
believe, that's when I wanted a record, you see. 
Because she wanted a record that way, and she

04:14.345 --> 04:18.711
couldn't I can't get nothing in Hueco, too. 
Because you can't find nothing in Hueco. But she

04:26.174 --> 04:33.885
passed a long time in my, the records that she throw 
away, or I don't know, because I never signed my

04:26.174 --> 04:33.885
name. I know I couldn't sign it, because I never 
signed it at that time.

04:42.937 --> 04:44.640
And where did you come across the border? Where did 
you come into Texas? I'm coming to Laredo. On a

04:50.112 --> 04:52.034
train? No, no, you had to cross to the bridge. The 
bridge. Papier. Hm? You walked across the bridge.

05:03.366 --> 05:03.466
Yeah. Well, back before that, when you were 
growing up in Mexico, what was it like? Well, a

05:09.552 --> 05:19.663
long time ago, I never seen no cars over there.

05:21.145 --> 05:25.229
Now I've been all down there. I see plenty of cars. I 
see tractor in the field too.

05:34.337 --> 05:35.738
She got plenty of water. You know, if it don't rain, 
there's plenty of water. Now, she don't have it

05:40.883 --> 05:46.008
before.

05:46.028 --> 05:48.570
No, no. There was water, but not in the river. They 
didn't go up there to water the land. What kind of

06:01.110 --> 06:06.238
work did your mother and father have? The ranch, to 
plant. Was it your own land? No. We lived here. It

06:15.612 --> 06:18.456
was just a little ranch. Well, I never met the 
landowner. There was one who gave me a piece of

06:24.096 --> 06:29.441
land. If I had to work the land, mules or whatever, 
he gave me a piece of land to work. And the other, if

06:40.113 --> 06:44.157
it didn't look good, he didn't give it to me. What

06:46.111 --> 06:54.622
was your father's name? Gregorio Vaca. And your 
mother? Dolores Hernandez.

07:07.678 --> 07:10.161
Were they from this part of Mexico? Yes, they came 
from there. From all their lives? Yes, they never

07:14.745 --> 07:18.411
came here. I have all my brothers, I don't think 
anyone came here, just me. And I'm the only one

07:22.337 --> 07:27.404
alive because they all died. All your brothers? 
How many brothers did you have? I had three

07:33.934 --> 07:37.600
brothers and two sisters, but they all died. Now 
it's just their nephews and their children. And

07:44.539 --> 07:47.122
all of your nephews are in Mexico? Yes, they are in 
Mexico. And

07:48.944 --> 07:56.192
during the revolution, were there problems in 
your ranch? Yes. What happened during the

07:57.854 --> 08:00.697
revolution? During the revolution, well, they 
were at home at night. It's like here, I'm in my

08:07.330 --> 08:10.015
house. At night they come and knock on the door, I go 
out to see. And then they put the carabiners there,

08:14.662 --> 08:22.956
that I have carabiners, I have something here. And 
they want to kill me because they say, and they go in

08:23.097 --> 08:29.567
to see what's there. Well, I don't feel it. Y 
cuántos años tenía usted? No, yo creo que tendría

08:35.929 --> 08:43.077
como unos 10 o 12 años. Fue en 1912, 1910, something 
like that. En qué año nació usted? Yo tengo 72. 72

08:53.069 --> 08:55.231
años ahora.

08:59.356 --> 09:00.017
Es...

09:02.967 --> 09:16.560
After 1912,

09:02.967 --> 09:16.560
is everything good or are there more problems? 
When the revolution ended, there were a lot of

09:17.061 --> 09:26.050
people who came to the houses. They said it was 
Pancho Villa. And no, it was Pancho Villa. Four or

09:35.773 --> 09:39.677
five of them would go to steal from the other ranch. 
They would take what they had and say, go with

09:39.717 --> 09:44.061
Pancho Villa. Pancho Villa didn't do anything to 
the people. He wasn't stealing.

09:52.489 --> 09:53.210
Who could? Pancho Villa would steal from the ones 
who had money, not the poor ones. The ones who had

09:59.756 --> 10:01.037
money. because they didn't want to pay. I remember 
that my father told him that he worked for three

10:06.723 --> 10:17.473
reales in Mexico at that time. I think it was 36 
cents. That's where we worked. All day. Three

10:27.763 --> 10:29.725
reales per day. I don't know. I don't think I can 
make a living right now. Because I'm used to it here

10:44.468 --> 10:48.271
now. I like seeing her go and stay awake and coming 
back. I can't make it. Well, did you visit Mexico?

11:00.982 --> 11:01.062
Yes. It was in April. In April? Last year? Yes, last 
year in April. Was it the first time? Yes, the first

11:13.378 --> 11:14.278
time. In 1920. It was the first time. Tell me about 
your trip. Well, it was good. Because we didn't

11:28.191 --> 11:29.412
last long. Let's say we go by bus or train. It takes 
longer. We get on the plane from San Antonio and in

11:37.285 --> 11:48.661
an hour and a half

11:37.285 --> 11:48.661
we get to Guadalajara. And from there we take the 
bus to Salamanca. We get to the lagoon. What time do

11:57.474 --> 12:00.158
we get there? Did

12:00.728 --> 12:29.233
it

12:00.728 --> 12:29.233
look like you remember, or did it look different, 
Mexico? Is it the same? No, it's not the same as it

12:32.052 --> 12:36.318
was when I was there. In what way was it different? 
It was different because there were no cars. They

12:45.710 --> 12:54.602
planted it the same way, but they have a different 
way of working. The land too. Before that, they

12:56.855 --> 13:02.705
used to work on the land with a mill. They didn't use 
mules there. No? No. What kind of animals did they

13:09.336 --> 13:12.721
have these days? Animals? Yes. Well, they were 
like cows. There were some who collected them. But

13:23.787 --> 13:27.191
there are no mudas these days? No, I don't see them. 
Horses? Not really. We went to the ranch where I was

13:35.501 --> 13:37.363
born. We went to the ranch and stayed there for a 
while and then we came back. But I don't see them.

13:48.937 --> 13:52.281
Yes, there are. What is your ranch called? 
Comaleros, le dijeron comaleros. Comaleros. ¿Y

13:57.921 --> 14:03.930
cuánta gente vivía allá? No, no hay muchos. ¿Y 
ahora? Tampoco. Viven unos allí, otros allá por

14:08.317 --> 14:15.608
retirado, y otros para allá, y así no viven, solos. 
¿Las casas están separadas? Unas y otras no.

14:23.356 --> 14:28.723
And who lived in your parents' house last April? I 
didn't know them. I didn't know them because they

14:32.148 --> 14:35.132
are other people. I didn't know them. But was it the 
same house? Yes. It's renovated. They served.

14:48.511 --> 14:49.532
Maybe... Is it possible to see your book?

14:57.282 --> 14:57.663
Bring the book. Bring the book. Hello. Hello. I'm 
Mary Lee Knowles. Oh, you're Mary Lee Knowles.

15:12.502 --> 15:17.308
Your father's being kind enough to tell me 
something about his experiences. trying to

15:17.862 --> 15:22.909
record stories of people who came here between 
1910 and 1920. We

15:23.049 --> 15:43.819
can cut this off.

15:47.225 --> 15:49.167
Maybe it's possible for you... He's my brother. Is 
he your brother? He's older than me. But he died.

16:02.962 --> 16:06.807
And before he died, what kind of work did he have? 
The same kind of work, to plant there. All your

16:10.190 --> 16:12.773
life? Yes. In Guanajuato? Yes. And your other 
brother? Well, that's where I came from. He was

16:19.403 --> 16:20.765
half a year old. He didn't work yet, but he knew what 
he was doing. I didn't know him. And your sisters?

16:27.857 --> 16:30.942
They got married, but they died. There are only the 
brothers-in-law. The men got married with them.

16:36.392 --> 16:39.357
And where do your brothers-in-law live now? They 
are there, in the ranch. In the ranch, not in the

16:41.540 --> 16:43.424
city? No. My sister-in-law is the wife of this one. 
She lives in the village. She lives in Salamanca.

16:53.072 --> 16:54.393
In Salamanca. And she had children? Yes. How many 
children? I turn on the light and look. How old are

17:03.783 --> 17:07.907
Regina's children? I mean, I didn't learn much. 
They have so many that I don't even know. There are

17:14.114 --> 17:19.060
two girls and two boys. Did they also live in 
Salamanca? No, I think they are in Mexico.

17:28.332 --> 17:32.438
In

17:28.332 --> 17:32.438
the city? Yes. What kind of work did these girls 
have? I don't know because I didn't know. I didn't

17:40.488 --> 17:42.771
know when I came. What kind of work did you have? 
Well, when you were about 20 years old, you left for

17:47.676 --> 17:54.164
Texas, right? I left for Texas. How? By train? By 
train. Tell me about this trip. How many days did it

18:01.392 --> 18:04.696
take? From there? Yes. Well, two.

18:10.763 --> 18:12.505
Two days? Two days to Laredo.

18:19.872 --> 18:20.092
Yes. I left, I left from there, they took me to the 
train. We took the train and stopped in a part over

18:26.838 --> 18:32.863
there, in Palme Gonzales. From there, we took 
another train and it came all the way here to

18:33.603 --> 18:42.351
Laredo. Yes.

18:46.150 --> 18:48.813
And...

18:51.135 --> 18:52.817
Were you alone? Yes, I came alone. Completely? 
Completely. There are no relatives or anyone in

18:56.320 --> 19:02.006
the United States? No. Well, this is a very brave 
thing,

19:03.027 --> 19:11.236
isn't it? For... Well, I think... After you came to

19:13.673 --> 19:37.960
the

19:13.673 --> 19:37.960
United

19:13.673 --> 19:37.960
States.

19:39.155 --> 19:40.857
Yeah, in here. In Bastrog. Bastrog. Well, he says 
he works in the Bastrog mines. Yes, I also work

19:49.707 --> 19:51.008
there. Is this your first job here? No, because I 
was working on the wagon. Yes. But from there, when

19:58.837 --> 20:04.183
I went to Anto, I worked in the mines. And this, what 
is this thing? This is where they took out the coal.

20:14.093 --> 20:14.373
Yes. There they left something there and they 
emptied it down and took it up. And for how many

20:19.403 --> 20:24.011
years do you work in Bastro? Well, I've been there 
since... In 1924. I was already there for a year.

20:33.210 --> 20:41.024
From there I went to Chicago in 1926. One year 
later, in 1926. I stayed there until 1927. I came

20:47.876 --> 20:53.425
and I was released again.

20:55.666 --> 21:01.875
And when I came back, I was working there again, and 
I came back. And then I didn't come back, but I came

21:03.137 --> 21:07.042
back in 1928. On the 8th of September, I came here to 
the Boramo. And I started working there. Here I am

21:14.913 --> 21:17.136
working, and I don't go anywhere. I worked a lot 
there in the ranches. Until I came here, to the

21:22.584 --> 21:24.627
town. This one? Yes. In which year? No, I don't 
remember.

21:35.671 --> 21:37.954
I don't remember which year it was. Ah, yes. This is 
your husband? Yes. And where was your husband

21:41.979 --> 21:44.163
born? He was born in Mexico. In which part? He was 
born... I don't know. Where

21:56.922 --> 22:02.189
do you live? In Lompocitos, Coahuila. In 
Lompocitos. Lompocitos, yes. In Estancia? Yes,

22:13.505 --> 22:15.888
in Estancia, Coahuila. In what year did you come to 
the United States? In 1920 too. In 1920 too? Yes, in

22:23.579 --> 22:24.780
1920. For what reason? My mother had a son and we 
came with him. He sent us here again with him. His

22:33.541 --> 22:34.242
brother. My mother and I only. My father was 
already dead for many years. He wanted us to come

22:43.315 --> 22:46.980
here with him. He was 15 years old when he passed 
away and we came here with him. We stayed here until

22:52.769 --> 22:55.853
today. Here we are, we have been here for many 
years. I have been to Mexico many times, but I'm

22:59.190 --> 23:03.457
just going to visit, that's all. Because I don't 
live there in Mexico, it's my land and everything,

23:03.477 --> 23:10.989
I mean, I was born there. But I'm already further 
away from here, and I think he too. Yes, because now

23:15.597 --> 23:23.089
that we went there, because the ranches are very 
sad, he taught us where he grew up and everything.

23:24.250 --> 23:27.935
In the village it's a little bit better. In 
Salamanca it's a little bit better. Because in the

23:31.220 --> 23:32.802
rural areas it's not. And what part of life do you 
have in the ranch? No, the ones that are in the

23:38.811 --> 23:41.575
ranch... No school? No school. The ones in the 
ranch, no. The ones in the village, yes. But the

23:46.642 --> 23:48.064
ones in the ranch, they go to school. In these days, 
before 1920? Yes. Now there are no schools? Now

23:53.225 --> 23:56.370
that we went, we didn't look. Now that we went, we 
saw that in the ranch. In the ranch, there are so

24:00.457 --> 24:06.326
many boys who go to school, but nothing. No, in the 
ranch, they don't. They grow up, they work where

24:10.213 --> 24:13.438
they can, in labor, I think. And this... I didn't 
know how to read. No, he didn't know. I didn't know

24:21.222 --> 24:23.846
how to read when I went to this side. I came to teach 
myself how to read here with my friends. I taught

24:27.191 --> 24:30.896
myself how to make letters. Now I can't do it 
anymore. I can read a letter and... Who knows? I'm

24:38.227 --> 24:40.871
struggling with some letters. But no... I didn't 
know. I didn't know how to read. There are no

24:48.583 --> 24:50.967
schools without... There were no schools. There 
were no schools. There aren't any, I think, yet.

24:56.836 --> 24:59.100
But it's very beautiful, the place we went to. Yes. 
It's very beautiful. Yes, Guanajuato. That's

25:00.762 --> 25:02.345
what Mexico has. Have you visited Guanajuato? 
Yes, yes. We went there, yes. In what year? It's

25:08.435 --> 25:09.857
been a year since April. In this same year? Yes, in 
this year. We went there on the 15th of April. We

25:18.549 --> 25:21.793
went there on the 15th of April. Next April, it will 
be a year. You go there all year round? No, no. We

25:26.599 --> 25:27.821
took a week. A week. A week, I understand. In April. 
Yes. In April, in 1972. Yes. In April. Yes, we went

25:34.329 --> 25:36.893
there for a week. Yes, a week. Yes, but it's very 
far. Yes? It's very far, yes. Well, for me it's not

25:43.643 --> 25:45.265
very far, as we saw. No, well, in the long run. 
But... In the long run, but... Over there it's...

25:50.413 --> 25:54.839
Yes, because people take about three days to get 
there. In a car. Where? Where? Over there, in

25:58.204 --> 25:59.767
Salamanca. From here? From here. Yes, about two 
days. Yes, about two and a half days. No, I don't

26:04.574 --> 26:07.418
think it's even that far. How do the guys from 
Sino-Michigan get here? They stay here for a day,

26:10.124 --> 26:15.190
and then it's one night, and then all night, and 
then a whole day, and then they get here. And then

26:15.910 --> 26:36.072
they go back, and they want to know... And then they 
go back, and then they go back, and then they go

26:15.910 --> 26:36.072
back, and then they go back, and then they go back, 
and then they go back, and then they go back, and

26:15.910 --> 26:36.072
then they go back, and then they go back, and then 
they go back, and then they go back, and then they go

26:15.910 --> 26:36.072
back, and then they go back, and then they go back, 
and then they go back, and then they go back, and

26:15.910 --> 26:36.072
then they go back, and then they go back, and then 
they go back, and then they go back, and then they go

26:15.910 --> 26:36.072
back, and then they go back, and then they go back, 
and then they go back, and then they go back, and

26:15.910 --> 26:36.072
then they go back, and then they go back, and then 
they go back,

26:40.557 --> 26:43.844
It's okay. Well, maybe too many voices.

26:53.123 --> 26:54.205
Well, it's okay. And in what year did you meet him?

27:16.113 --> 27:20.519
In 1924 in Bastrop, right? Yes, in Bastrop. And 
what kind of work did you have in Bastrop? The

27:26.648 --> 27:27.690
mines. The mines? The coal mines. And you? I did 
nothing at home with my mother. How old were you at

27:35.802 --> 27:38.586
that time? I was 14. 14? 14 years old. Quite young. 
Yes, 14. And your mother, what kind of work did she

27:43.753 --> 27:45.816
have? I assisted people, I aborted people. And 
your brother? My brother is also in the mine. Yes.

27:55.531 --> 28:03.561
And your family in Bastrak was only these three 
people? Your mother and you? Yes, nothing else.

28:06.344 --> 28:06.865
And your brother? Yes, nothing else. And you were 
alone? Alone. Completely alone? Yes, alone.

28:14.254 --> 28:15.195
Well, after I married, Where

28:15.833 --> 28:20.058
are you going? We're staying there. We're staying 
there. We're still working on the mine. Yes. For

28:30.251 --> 28:31.093
how many years? No, we don't work there much. Many

28:36.539 --> 28:41.466
years? No. No. And these things... They are on Iowa 
and other places. From here, when we went to work in

28:50.604 --> 28:59.661
the time of the war, we were working. The war of... 
Yes, the number two. The number two. Before that,

29:05.446 --> 29:11.354
did you go to other places or only after the war? No, 
only there. Only there. We went to work. We went to

29:15.940 --> 29:19.664
work in Metaveli. Metaveli and then to La Cebolla. 
Yes? For how many years? I don't remember how many

29:24.886 --> 29:28.910
years it lasted. We lived like four years in a row. I 
think so. Like four years, every year. Every year

29:35.176 --> 29:42.683
for four years? But only during the war? No. How do 
you say? We went, we came back and we were here like

29:47.708 --> 29:50.210
right now. Right now there is no work over there. We 
are here and then In May we started to get work. That

29:57.978 --> 30:02.102
was when we came back from here to work there again. 
Yes. And then we came back again, because what we

30:03.843 --> 30:09.910
had left, I didn't have work anywhere else. Only in 
the farm, in the labor. Yes. That's where

30:13.814 --> 30:18.238
we had it. But that was the work that we did every 
year. Yes. Did you like this job? No. No? Why not? It

30:28.617 --> 30:30.460
was very hard working. We had to walk on the street. 
We had to clean the table. Yes. It was very hard

30:36.566 --> 30:37.968
working. Now they say that they bring a hoe like 
here in the ranch. A long hoe. But then, no. They

30:46.177 --> 30:49.180
gave us a hoe and they would mow it for us. Just like 
that. Yes. If I could go. In Pinaba, yes, or in Cabo.

30:57.238 --> 31:00.703
That's how they did the work, but it was very hard. 
The work was very hard. Yes, the work was very hard.

31:04.609 --> 31:05.870
Yes.

31:08.454 --> 31:12.059
And were you there by car or? Sometimes we were on 
the train. On the train. The first time we were on

31:17.046 --> 31:18.568
the train. No. Let's see. Yes, I think so. The first 
time we went in a truck. There was a man who brought a

31:26.613 --> 31:28.955
truck. The second time we went on the train. They 
sent us tickets for the train. The other time I

31:38.304 --> 31:44.549
bought a car and we went in it. And

31:45.010 --> 31:51.195
the next year we were... It lasted about five

31:52.745 --> 31:59.793
years. I couldn't go there anymore when one of the 
girls who helped me got married. And then the other

32:08.083 --> 32:11.046
one too. And then she wasn't as good as this one who 
is here. This one, since she was a little girl, she

32:16.032 --> 32:21.739
was told that her feet weren't good. And I didn't 
leave because then I had to take them to Galveston.

32:30.371 --> 32:35.156
There were many trips from here to Galveston to 
help them and bring them and all that. And where

32:35.196 --> 32:44.705
did you live during the rest of the year, during 
this year? When we went and came back. Yes. We

32:50.811 --> 32:52.553
rented a house over there. Down here? Down here. 
And what kind of work did you have during the rest of

32:56.383 --> 33:01.811
the year? No, I came here, I worked in the city, I 
worked where they gave me work, and I worked.

33:09.283 --> 33:10.264
Different jobs? Different. I didn't work all the 
time in one single job. Different, because when I

33:16.313 --> 33:21.561
worked in the city I was digging. So I didn't have a 
machine. And when I worked with the plumber, it was

33:25.553 --> 33:29.079
the same. It was the same thing. I had to dig. Yes.

33:37.051 --> 33:39.034
And now what kind of work? Now I'm working in the 
school. I'm sweeping the rooms. In the school? Is

33:46.646 --> 33:47.568
it good work? No, it's good because it's not very 
heavy. San Jose. San Jose school? Yes. What school

33:56.177 --> 33:58.200
is this? Well, there is the church and the Catholic 
school. The big church of San Jose. And there is

34:06.008 --> 34:09.772
also the school. And they do the cleaning of 
everything. For how many years did you have this

34:16.960 --> 34:19.122
job? I've been there for about 4 or 5 years now. And 
before what? Before this work. I was at the

34:33.013 --> 34:36.718
academy. Who knows how long you've been working 
there? I've been there for about 4 or 5 years. And

34:47.215 --> 34:50.799
all her children went to school here? Yes, all of 
them. Her house for many years? Yes, yes.

34:58.426 --> 35:06.774
And these are more... Ah, Chiquita got married, is 
she her oldest daughter? Yes, yes. And her husband

35:07.956 --> 35:09.117
is from here? Yes, he is from here. No, Chinta. 
Chita. Oh, Chita. They are in Michigan. In

35:18.600 --> 35:19.581
Michigan? Yes, in Michigan. There they are. And 
her husband? He is also there. Is he from Michigan?

35:26.391 --> 35:26.811
No. Well, here they got married, but they left for 
another country. Here they got married and they

35:31.918 --> 35:35.964
have a mother. Yes. This lady who just came is his 
sister. Oh, yes. And what kind of work did Chinta

35:42.346 --> 35:45.850
have? Chinta's husband? No, he didn't work here. I 
think he worked in Piscando Algodón and all that.

35:55.843 --> 36:00.248
They worked like that when they were here. But 
since they left, they didn't... They also went to

36:01.550 --> 36:06.176
Betabel, over there, when they left. No, it's just 
that there was work there on the Antani plant and

36:06.196 --> 36:11.222
there it is. She's working in a hospital now.

36:18.838 --> 36:28.693
And this is your...

36:18.838 --> 36:28.693
Is this about your trip? Yes, yes, yes. This is my 
daughter, Alicia. Yes. They took her there, I

36:34.422 --> 36:37.446
think, in Brandeis.

36:41.712 --> 36:44.576
And this one in Guadalajara. Do you like 
Guadalajara? Yes, it's beautiful. Salamanca

36:51.467 --> 36:53.851
too?

36:55.473 --> 36:58.578
Yes, it's beautiful. There are a lot of refineries 
there. I don't know what they do there. Was it

37:10.231 --> 37:15.737
gasoline?

37:17.680 --> 37:18.601
I don't know. There was no gasoline. Because it was 
so different from where you came from. Yes, it was

37:26.890 --> 37:30.795
so different from the years I lived there. Very 
different. Yes. Was life different in the ranch as

37:31.776 --> 37:35.580
well? The farms are not the same. The farms are the 
same. I think they are the same. They are the same.

37:41.705 --> 37:44.768
They are exactly the same. Exactly. They are sown, 
we saw the wheat sown, like here, where there are

37:46.350 --> 37:59.944
parts that are sown in wheat, oats and chickpeas, 
and all that, alfalfa and everything. The people,

38:00.004 --> 38:04.268
the people of the ranch live with what they get from 
work, that's all. No fiestas o nada? No. Nada.

38:09.454 --> 38:09.855
Nada? Nomás ahí en el rancho. Sí.

38:17.382 --> 38:19.825
¿Y su familia fue de un rancho también? ¿La mía? Sí. 
Pues no. No. Allí en Las Minas. Las Minas también.

38:27.913 --> 38:28.653
Las Minas. Las Minas, sí. There are mines here on 
the banks of the river. From Piedras Negras to

38:35.797 --> 38:37.698
there. Yes, the border. Is the life of the mines 
different from the life of the ranch? Yes, because

38:44.965 --> 38:47.848
the ranch is pure labor. And the mines are not. They 
are just pure mines. And this?

39:04.913 --> 39:10.959
Well, in those mines, one is buried on the way, 
almost on the way. It goes down, it goes about 200

39:11.280 --> 39:16.726
feet down. And then it walks underneath to go to 
work there, far from there. Yes. And when the time

39:21.651 --> 39:26.075
comes, it comes there and they take it out. But if it 
breaks, it falls. Yes. Those who have died there,

39:30.360 --> 39:33.283
here in Mexico, In Mexico, a mine exploded and many 
people died. And

39:38.263 --> 39:51.598
this is her sister-in-law?

39:52.519 --> 39:54.321
Yes, sister-in-law. She was the one we went to see. 
Is this her house? It's her little house. I think

40:03.284 --> 40:07.410
this is the little house. It's going to be 
renovated, right? This is the little house where I

40:11.095 --> 40:14.380
was born. It's going to be renovated. They 
renovated it. Yes. That's where they were

40:20.188 --> 40:20.989
created. They were condemned in that little 
house. Yes. This one. You were born here? Yes. Yes.

40:29.962 --> 40:30.203
In this one. Yes. And this one? Is this the same one? 
Yes, it's the same. This is the river. There is a man

40:47.409 --> 40:55.059
on the other side and they have this thing to pass to 
this side. He brings a donkey. And he threw it

40:57.352 --> 41:02.504
inside and passed it to this side. And the girls 
portrayed him. They portrayed the man with that.

41:10.162 --> 41:13.529
Was he the same in the days before 1920? The regent. 
With the boat too? There was one, but that one was

41:15.020 --> 41:19.329
worn with a stick. Ah, yes. It's more modern now. 
Yes, it's more modern. That one is more modern. And

41:28.188 --> 41:29.350
what is this? Well, here is where they portrayed 
the man who came. This is the man who brought the

41:35.639 --> 41:39.084
gun. He said that they portrayed him again. When he 
passed by, they portrayed him again. Yes, yes. How

41:52.665 --> 41:53.727
far is it? It's very... It's very... Is your ranch 
far away from Salamanca or not? It's far away. How

42:04.139 --> 42:08.725
long does it take to get there? We were taken by car. 
We didn't last very long. We would go in the morning

42:13.652 --> 42:19.079
to the village. We would get up at 4 a.m. and we would 
wake up in the village. I was

42:28.257 --> 42:41.473
afraid of crossing the river when my father died. 
There was a bridge. We had to cross that bridge and

42:44.176 --> 42:47.980
we were so far apart. I was afraid of crossing the 
bridge because we were surrounded by water. And

42:59.155 --> 43:03.582
the people who lived in your house, were they nice 
or not? The people who now live here. Oh, we didn't

43:07.768 --> 43:10.653
know them. I think those people left. Oh, yes. We 
just went there because... And there are people in

43:13.998 --> 43:18.344
the house, there are people living there. We went 
there for my sister-in-law. My sister-in-law was

43:19.847 --> 43:22.470
the one who took me there. Because... We had gone on 
our own, who knows if they found us. They don't know

43:32.000 --> 43:40.551
us.

43:40.571 --> 43:44.957
There was a lady who said she remembered me. She's 
old now. It's a little house. She lives alone in

43:49.872 --> 43:52.778
that little house. It's a little room. There she 
cooks, there she sleeps and everything. It's a

43:59.530 --> 44:02.516
fireplace, there she makes food. Down on the 
floor. Down? Down on the floor. She's very old. And

44:09.254 --> 44:14.202
he says he remembers that rabbit because he met him 
when he was very young. Yes. Yes, he remembers.

44:19.791 --> 44:20.973
He was still a child. But he is not a relative? No. 
No, he is just a friend. And

44:25.621 --> 44:35.076
life there is not very different.

44:37.773 --> 44:43.079
Well, it's different here, because here you live 
better. Here you live better than there. Well,

44:50.186 --> 44:55.412
life here in Texas is better now or not? No, of 
course not. It's much better. Because before we

44:58.916 --> 45:04.221
also worked, I worked to be a father since the day. 
Here? Here? Three pesos a week. All day. All day.

45:10.887 --> 45:16.412
Sun

45:10.887 --> 45:16.412
up, sun down. Now, more or less, you earn more than a 
dollar an hour. Everything is expensive, but you

45:23.459 --> 45:27.003
earn more. You pay your bills, or whatever. 
Everything costs you. But at that time,

45:34.490 --> 45:36.552
everything was very cheap. The food, the clothes, 
everything, everything was cheap. But as you

45:40.844 --> 45:48.675
wish, you didn't have to pay three pesos to buy a 
pair of pants. Otherwise, it would cost you one

45:48.695 --> 45:51.159
peso. Well, you would have to pay one peso to the 
three of us to buy the food. As you wish, it's very

46:00.472 --> 46:03.957
different now.
