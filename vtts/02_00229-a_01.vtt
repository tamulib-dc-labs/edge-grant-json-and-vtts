00:01.921 --> 00:02.802
This is a test.

00:02.822 --> 00:03.724
This is a test.

00:03.744 --> 00:06.067
Today's date is February 1st, 1984.

00:07.809 --> 00:26.156
This is an interview with Norman Borlaug, B-O-R-L-A-U-G, Nobel Prize winner, 1970, father of the Green Revolution, and visiting professor at Texas A&M University.

00:26.196 --> 00:27.918
This is Terry Anderson.

00:28.179 --> 00:29.160
This is a test.

00:31.874 --> 00:33.837
This is an interview with Norman Borlaug.

00:34.237 --> 00:37.722
Today is February 6, 1984.

00:38.042 --> 00:39.564
This is Terry Anderson.

00:40.345 --> 00:43.950
We'd like to first start by talking about your parents.

00:44.811 --> 00:47.514
Could you tell us about your background?

00:47.534 --> 00:54.143
And if you'd like to go back before your parents and your grandparents, if you remember them, we'd like to start right there.

00:55.124 --> 01:00.531
Well, I guess I'd better go back at least one generation, maybe two.

01:00.730 --> 01:08.520
Although things get pretty foggy when you get back past the second one.

01:10.743 --> 01:29.387
Apparently my grandfather on the Borlaug side was born in Wisconsin and when he was I think only a few months of age the family moved in a covered wagon to

01:30.278 --> 01:33.342
Vermilion, South Dakota.

01:35.545 --> 01:39.229
They had lived in Wisconsin, I think, six or seven years.

01:40.631 --> 01:48.181
Settled there and apparently this farm was getting too small and they decided they were going to move farther to the frontier.

01:51.044 --> 01:54.649
Just how long they were in Vermilion isn't clear.

01:55.405 --> 02:00.991
But when the Indian uprisings occurred out there, they moved back to Northeast Isle.

02:02.633 --> 02:09.380
And I was born under the grand parental... So they moved back then sometime in what, the 1880s?

02:09.780 --> 02:15.887
No, back in the 1860s sometime.

02:17.809 --> 02:19.951
I'm not sure the exact year.

02:21.132 --> 02:21.953
In any case,

02:23.232 --> 02:32.004
I do remember that little one-room country school that I attended, which my father attended.

02:32.144 --> 02:36.991
My grandfather also went to that same one-room country school.

02:37.272 --> 02:42.799
That was built in 1862, New Oregon Township No.

02:42.819 --> 02:43.080
8.

02:46.545 --> 02:49.308
Those, of course, are among my early recollection.

02:51.171 --> 02:51.872
Since then,

02:53.033 --> 03:02.964
or in recent years, when I've been back in Europe, I stopped and tried to trace back my roots.

03:03.865 --> 03:15.738
And I found that, first I found that there were two branches of the family that lived, they both lived on Sognafjord.

03:16.218 --> 03:19.462
And I found out about the first contact in a very curious way.

03:20.222 --> 03:22.585
Back in about 60, maybe 60,

03:24.421 --> 03:28.765
60, let's see if I can fix the time.

03:30.386 --> 03:47.562
Somewhere around 1966 or thereabouts when I was on a Pan American plane flying from New York to New Delhi to assist in the wheat work there.

03:49.023 --> 03:52.386
This flight went through Beirut and

03:53.564 --> 03:55.466
I was asleep when the crew changed.

03:56.767 --> 04:02.753
And when the flight left, I looked up.

04:02.773 --> 04:08.959
Somebody touched me on the shoulder and said, are you Dr. Borlaug?

04:08.979 --> 04:09.860
And I said, yes, ma'am.

04:10.961 --> 04:15.225
And it was the stewardess, the purser, with the seating chart.

04:16.346 --> 04:20.050
And she said, where are you coming from?

04:20.070 --> 04:22.052
And I said, Mexico.

04:25.222 --> 04:27.545
She looked at me and she said, but you're not Mexican.

04:30.028 --> 04:32.090
I thought this was getting a little personal.

04:33.152 --> 04:37.817
And she asked one or two other questions that were also very leading.

04:37.897 --> 04:40.360
And finally, I stood up and I said, you must be a Borlaug.

04:41.662 --> 04:42.403
She said, I am.

04:42.763 --> 04:43.884
And this is the first time.

04:44.005 --> 04:48.830
She said, I'm from Norway, from up at the head of Sodomfjord.

04:49.751 --> 04:55.178
And you're the first person in the Americas that I've ever run into, and I've

04:55.394 --> 05:20.895
been flying for Pan American for eight years and I've looked in all the telephone books in the different parts of the country wherever Pan American was based and I've never seen the name and yet we know that Borlaug's back in the middle of the last century moved to the Americas and so I exchanged cards with her

05:21.415 --> 05:33.888
Then when I went to Norway, I guess the first time was en route back from the Soviet Union, maybe in 69.

05:36.591 --> 05:42.598
And so I decided to see if I could find where my heritage and my parents came from.

05:43.999 --> 05:46.122
And I went down to the fjord.

05:46.402 --> 05:49.265
And the first place I stopped was up at the head of the fjord.

05:49.325 --> 05:50.106
It's right at the end.

05:51.031 --> 05:55.177
And this was the branch of the family that this stewardess came from.

05:55.197 --> 05:58.161
It was not the one that we came from.

05:58.181 --> 06:13.603
We came from about, I suppose, 40 kilometers, 20, 30 miles, farther down the fjord, a little place called Feos, F-A-E-O-S, I suppose, on the south side of the fjord.

06:13.844 --> 06:20.413
I was taken to the place where the great grand parental family lived.

06:22.267 --> 06:29.117
And all that was there, of course, was some old granite boulders that were part of the foundation of the house.

06:30.199 --> 06:43.238
I got the impression that the plot of land that the family probably controlled was no bigger than this building, at least certainly not twice the size of this building.

06:43.258 --> 06:51.430
And since they left in about 1850,

06:51.933 --> 06:59.865
which coincided with about the time of the late Black famine in Western Europe, and especially in Ireland and the UK.

07:00.646 --> 07:06.935
Well, I decided that they probably got sick of just eating fish after the potatoes failed.

07:07.256 --> 07:08.718
And so they all migrated.

07:08.758 --> 07:14.106
Later, I made contact with some of the family on my mother's side.

07:14.126 --> 07:15.728
They also were Norwegian.

07:16.549 --> 07:20.455
They came from the south, however.

07:20.705 --> 07:24.049
Her name was Vala, and they came one generation later.

07:24.690 --> 07:30.397
I gathered that there was this problem.

07:30.417 --> 07:37.787
It was probably different in different parts of Norway as to how much you depended on potatoes.

07:37.807 --> 07:46.919
In those rocky, narrow fjords, it was all potatoes and fish, apparently, pretty largely, because the land didn't lend itself for growing rye or wheat.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.402
There was too little land.

07:49.802 --> 07:50.323
Well, anyway,

07:50.911 --> 07:59.281
Going back now, and so, great-grandfather Ole Borlaug migrated.

07:59.361 --> 08:00.663
They landed in Wisconsin.

08:00.683 --> 08:01.404
They settled there.

08:02.845 --> 08:06.890
My grandfather was the third oldest.

08:08.312 --> 08:09.734
He was one of five.

08:10.875 --> 08:13.478
He would have been the third oldest.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.121
He was born in Wisconsin.

08:17.082 --> 08:19.365
Apparently, the family moved west

08:20.020 --> 08:24.406
when the farm that they first settled on, which was near Racine.

08:26.950 --> 08:30.535
Why did they pick Wisconsin?

08:30.595 --> 08:38.226
No, I think they just simply came down the lake, St.

08:38.246 --> 08:40.650
Lawrence down the lake.

08:41.091 --> 08:43.394
So far as I know, they didn't know anyone.

08:43.414 --> 08:47.199
There may have been others on the same boat, of course, from the same area.

08:48.601 --> 08:49.723
And apparently when they

08:49.957 --> 09:17.428
when they were frightened out of Dakota, South Dakota, they moved back to Northeast Iowa and there I think the linkages were because they were families from Wisconsin who had settled directly in Northeast Iowa and they knew about this so they went back to Northeast Iowa in this little community which was called Sauda, only in English we used to call it Saudi, S-A-U-D-E.

09:18.269 --> 09:19.170
This was the same

09:19.775 --> 09:27.202
name as the village that they came from, that my mother's family came from.

09:28.483 --> 09:33.748
So they just did what so many other immigrants did by just transporting the name, the whole cultural baggage.

09:33.908 --> 09:47.520
Yes, but the curious thing was in 69 or 70 when I went back there and I tried to find Salda, and I had known through my collaborative work in Pakistan, Professor Advar Arsling,

09:47.888 --> 09:57.140
who was Professor of Agricultural Economics at the University of Oslo, or of OS, the Agricultural College.

09:57.160 --> 10:09.475
And he was on home leave at that time, and before he left, before I went to Soviet Union, I said, I'm coming back through there, and I'd like to look around and see if I can find where some of my people came from.

10:10.433 --> 10:15.480
By the time I got back, he said, there's no place named like this before he left.

10:16.061 --> 10:19.226
But he said, when I get back, well, I'll check into it.

10:19.246 --> 10:22.871
One of my old professors, very old, but he's mentally very sharp.

10:23.692 --> 10:25.615
And he must know if anybody would know.

10:26.116 --> 10:30.142
By the time I came back from the Soviet Union, I stopped to see him.

10:30.162 --> 10:39.495
Then the whole thing had unraveled that this place that was originally Saldet, S-A-U-D-E, had been

10:40.420 --> 10:42.903
changed to Sauherad in 1928.

10:42.983 --> 10:47.269
It was the original name that they transplanted to the U.S.

10:47.329 --> 10:48.250
was a Danish name.

10:48.631 --> 10:57.101
And apparently in one of the waves of nationalism, they changed it back to Sauherad, which is the place.

10:57.121 --> 11:03.349
So we went to, Professor Osvik took me to this little Lutheran church.

11:03.409 --> 11:07.795
This was the right place out in the

11:09.935 --> 11:18.768
was all the tombstones of the same families around Saudi, on my mother's side, the Landsbergs and Sennenson's.

11:18.788 --> 11:19.829
That wasn't that fascinating.

11:20.090 --> 11:20.691
Yes, it was.

11:21.111 --> 11:26.579
And the Lutheran pastor, he said, well, you sit over there in that second pew.

11:26.619 --> 11:33.449
That's where the valas always sat, and we'll sing the doxology or whatever it was.

11:34.190 --> 11:37.475
So that was quite interesting.

11:37.495 --> 11:38.777
This old church was

11:39.736 --> 11:43.803
one of the early ones after conversion to Christianity, stone.

11:45.867 --> 11:48.833
He said, let me show you something.

11:48.873 --> 12:02.217
So we went back in the back, and when they had been refinishing scratching off the paint, there they found some of the old pagan Norse

12:03.462 --> 12:04.984
They were still there.

12:05.565 --> 12:06.927
He said, we didn't destroy them.

12:07.188 --> 12:09.391
It's not blatant.

12:09.411 --> 12:13.117
You don't see it out in front, but here back behind, there it is.

12:13.597 --> 12:15.460
He said, I thought you'd be interested.

12:15.480 --> 12:19.967
So this dates back to the early conversion to Christianity.

12:21.610 --> 12:29.722
I've forgotten the date that they put on this church, but it was one of the very early ones in that part of Norway.

12:30.143 --> 12:32.406
Then we found also

12:33.145 --> 12:34.967
threads to my mother's family.

12:35.167 --> 12:42.334
Again there, all of the boys, the sons, had migrated to the U.S., to Wisconsin, and then to Northeast Isle.

12:43.234 --> 12:50.061
But the daughters had married and stayed in Norway, and so we made some contacts there.

12:50.081 --> 12:52.563
And they probably came more about the 1870s now?

12:52.583 --> 12:57.668
They came, yes.

12:57.688 --> 12:59.309
Yes, I think that's right.

12:59.429 --> 13:02.292
They came about 20 years after

13:02.710 --> 13:06.693
Did they go straight out then to northeastern Iowa?

13:06.814 --> 13:09.536
No, they'd settled in Wisconsin, too, and then moved to Iowa.

13:10.016 --> 13:16.462
But I think Wisconsin was getting a little crowded from the standpoint of the pieces of land that were available.

13:16.602 --> 13:16.882
Sure.

13:17.202 --> 13:31.975
By that time, probably also, there was a little better machinery, and so you needed, even though it was bullock pulled, maybe horse and some, but I would imagine most of it was still oxen, you needed a little better, bigger piece of land.

13:32.579 --> 13:44.815
So they moved to northeast Iowa and apparently where they had settled in Wisconsin, the Borlaugs had been there and moved to the Dakotas.

13:46.397 --> 13:55.208
But many of those Wisconsin families had moved to northeast Iowa and so the Borlaugs came back to northeast Iowa.

13:56.249 --> 14:02.417
And there my grandfather settled and his family

14:02.971 --> 14:04.273
Let's see, there were three boys.

14:05.415 --> 14:09.501
My father was the second oldest, Henry Borlaug.

14:09.981 --> 14:11.143
Three boys and one daughter.

14:12.585 --> 14:15.650
They lived on this small farm.

14:15.670 --> 14:19.455
Well, I guess for its time, it was probably not too bad.

14:19.475 --> 14:21.679
It was 120 acres or some such thing.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.763
And the soil was very good.

14:25.564 --> 14:29.069
They were probably rather, were they for prosperous, did you think?

14:30.552 --> 14:31.493
No, they were.

14:31.642 --> 14:40.050
Well, they lived a comfortable life, but they never wanted for anything.

14:40.531 --> 14:44.174
And I have a little old account book of my grandfather's.

14:44.895 --> 14:47.497
I wish I had brought it from Mexico.

14:47.517 --> 14:54.704
It shows how things were in those times, going back apparently right after he was married.

14:57.046 --> 14:57.767
I think

14:58.051 --> 15:14.496
was before my aunt, the youngest member of the family was born, but the three sons and granddad and grandmother, they never did have an income until about the third year in this entry in the early 80s of more than $50 cash.

15:15.777 --> 15:23.569
Then there's one that went about three times that much and that was when they sold the first crop of flax, apparently

15:24.511 --> 15:26.514
That brought them quite a bit of money.

15:26.895 --> 15:40.595
But the curious thing is to see how he accounted for everything down to a nickel, even two cents in his own handwriting.

15:40.615 --> 15:42.818
The value of a dollar back up.

15:42.978 --> 15:51.130
One interesting item there we used to, I never found this until after grandfather died much later.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.172
But I used to kid dad.

15:52.658 --> 15:53.679
about this.

15:53.959 --> 15:59.065
Granddad was a bit of a rebel if you glance through that.

15:59.405 --> 16:01.707
In what way?

16:03.189 --> 16:10.997
He always used to be blunt about too much hypocrisy going on around here.

16:11.197 --> 16:19.746
If he wanted to, for example, we lived on the edge of a Norwegian

16:20.047 --> 16:32.903
community, but there were some wood lots, 10-acre wood lots, that were owned by Bohemians, Czechoslovaks, but they called themselves Bohemians, that lived in the next village.

16:33.864 --> 16:39.791
So they'd come there and cut wood, and they'd come and go hunting squirrels and rabbits in the winter when it was cold.

16:40.392 --> 16:49.243
And so I remember Hideo always used to invite them in, and when they were cold, he'd have a little alcohol and get the tea kettle,

16:49.797 --> 16:51.839
pour a little of this and put sugar into it.

16:53.341 --> 17:02.872
Since we were raised pretty straight Lutherans, some of the members of the family didn't like this very much, but my granddad was like that.

17:02.892 --> 17:03.233
He said, wow.

17:05.175 --> 17:07.918
He was pretty strong-willed in this respect.

17:09.019 --> 17:18.150
And so I used to kid dad about, I said, look, look, and he spent a dollar of that budget on alcohol.

17:18.907 --> 17:21.010
I said, that was a pretty heavy part of the budget.

17:21.871 --> 17:26.778
Dad and Uncle Oscar both would say, yeah, but that was the medicine of the time, too.

17:27.098 --> 17:28.220
And up to a point it was.

17:28.320 --> 17:37.913
When you'd get a cold, they would put a little of that in hot water and some, we didn't have lemon juice and some sugar, and that was it.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.899
So I guess that was okay, but Granddad was like that.

17:42.139 --> 17:46.365
He always used to say, I believe in

17:46.936 --> 17:51.500
not beating around the bush and saying how things really are.

17:51.981 --> 18:15.542
Well, I was born and lived under the grandparental roof until, let's see, I was born on 25th of March, 1914, and we moved to the adjacent little farm where we built our own buildings in 1922, I suppose first of October or thereabouts.

18:16.653 --> 18:23.879
So I was eight years old when we moved from the Grandville home.

18:23.899 --> 18:34.189
By that time, I had a lot of fond memories of both grandfather and grandmother because I was the oldest of all the grandchildren.

18:34.209 --> 18:45.799
And having been born under that roof, I guess the ties were closer than for most of the others.

18:46.235 --> 18:47.857
How would you describe your grandparents?

18:47.877 --> 18:48.878
What type of people were they?

18:49.258 --> 18:50.179
They were very different.

18:50.719 --> 18:54.303
Grandmother and grandfather.

18:55.284 --> 19:00.208
They were both very wonderful, friendly people.

19:01.189 --> 19:09.717
But my grandfather sometimes all, for example, he was a sort of rebellious when it came to the church.

19:10.198 --> 19:13.601
He'd say, too many of them are hypocrites.

19:13.701 --> 19:15.583
They live one way.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.628
and go to church and look holy.

19:19.968 --> 19:26.558
And that didn't sit well with him until he was much later in life, and then he mellowed.

19:26.578 --> 19:32.887
But my earliest recollections, he'd get in some pretty strong arguments about this, living through lives.

19:34.369 --> 19:37.213
Grandmother, of course, was very different.

19:37.233 --> 19:43.442
But what I admire about both of them, Norwegian certainly was their first language.

19:44.043 --> 19:45.705
They must have learned it as young children.

19:46.833 --> 19:54.186
But they read voraciously in both English and Norwegian.

19:54.206 --> 20:03.241
They still, at the time, my earliest recollections, and for many years after, they used to get the Scandinavian from Chicago.

20:03.261 --> 20:10.714
And the Koraposten, a little northeast Iowa, weekly, I guess it was.

20:11.268 --> 20:28.683
as well as the major, I guess they used to get, I don't remember, Kansas City Star or some such thing, and the weekly agricultural journals, Wallace, Farmer, and Homestead, these sort of things.

20:29.544 --> 20:31.586
In that respect, they were very progressive.

20:32.166 --> 20:35.209
They had one of the early little radios.

20:35.569 --> 20:40.954
Granddad especially used to like to keep up on the news, listen to what was going on,

20:41.103 --> 20:51.456
agriculture, and my father and mother, excuse me.

20:51.476 --> 20:52.938
Okay, where were we?

20:52.958 --> 20:53.579
Dad and mother?

20:54.120 --> 20:56.162
Yeah, no, we were talking about your grandfather.

20:56.182 --> 20:58.405
Grandparents.

20:58.425 --> 21:05.334
And my grandmother, she was a very well-read person also.

21:07.136 --> 21:10.300
One thing that I remember vividly about my grandfather, and I

21:10.972 --> 21:12.574
often reflect on this.

21:12.734 --> 21:39.628
He told me during the worst of the depression when farms were going broke, banks went broke and people were left penniless and their farms were foreclosed on to repay the double indemnity clauses on their bank stock and then a couple of years later, a year later, their personal property was sold at sheriff's sale

21:40.655 --> 21:48.043
My granddad told me one day, he said, look, Norman, you get an education.

21:49.444 --> 21:57.893
These upheavals, social upheavals will come and go, but if you have a good education, you can always rebuild from the ground up.

21:57.913 --> 22:02.318
And if you don't have it, and then you lose everything, then it's a real problem.

22:03.679 --> 22:06.122
And I suppose

22:06.642 --> 22:14.950
Among other things, this was one of the things that motivated me to try to get a higher education.

22:16.972 --> 22:17.772
Years later.

22:17.812 --> 22:22.397
Yeah, that your grandfather had a definite impact on your character in your development.

22:22.417 --> 22:22.577
Oh, yes.

22:22.597 --> 22:23.238
Definitely.

22:24.319 --> 22:32.166
And in that respect- Other things besides education, that you think he had a strong impact?

22:32.186 --> 22:34.188
I think he had in one other way.

22:34.868 --> 22:35.569
Okay.

22:36.427 --> 22:47.798
All the rest of the members of the family were inclined to be, never speak too bluntly or straightforward on any issue.

22:47.998 --> 22:54.304
I mean, they didn't believe in being too blunt.

22:54.324 --> 22:59.789
But when it was an issue that my grandfather felt strongly about, he didn't pull any punches.

23:00.970 --> 23:03.312
And I guess I inherited a bit of that also.

23:03.612 --> 23:07.677
If I feel strongly about something, I'm going to say it like it is.

23:07.697 --> 23:31.003
For example, in many of these environmental issues of the day, like all of this ethylene-dibromide right now, and many of these others, I get pretty disgusted with the overkill that goes on where you substitute emotions for scientific data and their interpretation.

23:31.287 --> 23:36.834
Don't pull any punches when I have a chance in the right podium from which to say this.

23:36.874 --> 23:50.612
And I'm sure that part of that came from what I learned from my grandfather's philosophy on not being afraid to speak out, even though sometimes it's unpleasant from a personal standpoint.

23:52.735 --> 23:57.019
I was wondering if he was ever in any of the farm organizations.

23:57.039 --> 24:01.142
No, he was never a member of any.

24:01.203 --> 24:09.370
No, there was none of those organizations were in existence around the community at that time.

24:11.472 --> 24:14.354
Not around that little rural community.

24:16.276 --> 24:20.259
Do you know if he ever supported the populist party or any other?

24:20.279 --> 24:22.101
He used to read these sorts of things.

24:24.241 --> 24:31.050
pretty liberal on all of these sorts of things, but he was never a member of any of them.

24:31.691 --> 24:32.092
Excuse me.

24:33.594 --> 24:34.435
This is your interview.

24:34.455 --> 24:34.695
No, no.

24:34.715 --> 24:42.826
Well, I was going to say, what political party did he usually support when you were young, when you were very young and you were still on the farm?

24:42.946 --> 24:44.468
I think he was a true independent.

24:44.488 --> 24:51.398
He'd vote for whoever caught his fancy.

24:51.418 --> 24:53.961
But I think quite often on the

24:54.515 --> 24:56.897
liberal side center.

25:00.941 --> 25:02.082
How about your grandmother?

25:02.102 --> 25:05.826
La Follette and these sorts of people.

25:05.886 --> 25:07.668
Progressives, progressives.

25:07.688 --> 25:07.968
Yes.

25:08.689 --> 25:23.863
My grandmother on the Borlaug side, Swenemson was her family name, she didn't take much interest in politics, but she used to read very broadly, both of them.

25:24.248 --> 25:45.817
On my mother's side, the two grandparents, Vala, Ole Vala, who came really one generation later, he was not married when he migrated from Norway, and he married in Wisconsin, but he became a very successful farmer.

25:46.277 --> 25:47.739
He expanded when he should have.

25:48.320 --> 25:51.184
He had a large family.

25:52.295 --> 25:57.283
quite different than the Borlaugs, which were four for that time, which was not a big family.

25:57.984 --> 26:05.296
But he had eight daughters, of which my mother was one and three sons.

26:06.377 --> 26:09.823
And he got to be a big and wealthy farmer for his time.

26:10.885 --> 26:18.657
And bought a lot of land, and I think a lot of that land, I don't remember the details,

26:19.075 --> 26:33.671
or turned over to certain members of the family and he retired fairly early, probably in his late 50s or early 60s, but he never, he didn't live very long.

26:33.691 --> 26:40.779
He died, I suppose, when I was 10 or 11 from pneumonia.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.243
Did you have much contact with them?

26:44.263 --> 26:45.825
Much less because they lived in

26:46.261 --> 26:49.225
the town of New Hampton, which was about 18 miles away.

26:49.886 --> 26:57.977
And 18 miles, what kind of roads we had at that time, didn't see them too often.

26:57.997 --> 27:01.882
How many acres did they have in his farm, do you remember?

27:01.902 --> 27:05.106
Well, I don't remember because it was split up in different farms.

27:06.047 --> 27:08.691
But it would have been for its time.

27:09.802 --> 27:13.146
if you put them all together, a large farm.

27:13.186 --> 27:16.291
Was there some jealousy between the grandparents?

27:16.971 --> 27:19.054
They never had much to do with each other.

27:21.197 --> 27:38.560
To my knowledge, no personal animosities, but they just, one lived in New Hampton, and the Borlaks, their town where they traded,

27:38.962 --> 27:41.405
The railroad town was Cresco.

27:41.465 --> 27:46.350
And Cresco and New Hampton were about 30 miles apart.

27:46.370 --> 27:53.177
The little community where we lived was just about halfway between, but a little closer to Cresco.

27:54.879 --> 28:04.950
And that little community was a wide four corners.

28:05.471 --> 28:08.614
All it had was a general country store.

28:09.927 --> 28:17.578
a feed mill, blacksmith shop, a farmer's cooperative creamery, and two Lutheran churches.

28:18.479 --> 28:22.484
It occurred after the split, apparently, one of the churches was built.

28:23.025 --> 28:30.896
The original community was with a straight lace that I came from, Norwegian or the Missouri Synod.

28:32.238 --> 28:34.761
You're familiar with the structure of the Lutheran church.

28:35.282 --> 28:39.748
And the Norwegian Synod of the Missouri Synod was one of the most ultra-conservative

28:40.842 --> 28:44.986
And that was apparently the first congregation.

28:45.006 --> 28:55.778
And then when the... I can remember, not very vividly, when the split came and when the other church came into being.

28:55.798 --> 28:57.319
And that had some unpleasantries.

28:58.060 --> 29:06.629
But that was not involved between my two grandparents' families because they both stayed in the original.

29:07.189 --> 29:08.130
Oh, they did?

29:09.952 --> 29:10.613
Oh, why?

29:12.162 --> 29:14.646
Why the difference between the two?

29:14.946 --> 29:18.632
Why did they both stay in the same?

29:18.732 --> 29:27.305
I think probably mainly because the change itself is kind of in anything we do.

29:28.166 --> 29:36.098
I'm a firm believer that status quo, for the most part, unless there are some really big issues involved, is comfortable.

29:37.039 --> 29:38.862
The fear of the unknown is

29:39.145 --> 29:40.626
frightening.

29:40.646 --> 29:49.053
This is, I think, a basic principle in all social reform, in everything that I've done in my scientific life in developing nations.

29:50.154 --> 30:02.685
One of my biggest problems to get technology transferred and into operation after it's been adequately tested, that it's as foolproof as you can make it, is to get people to change.

30:03.906 --> 30:08.950
And even though they blame the farmer

30:09.453 --> 30:27.872
for being ultra conservative, it's been my experience that the most conservative of the lot are the senior scientists and the top bureaucrats because they've struggled for a long time in their careers to reach the pinnacle and then you don't want somebody rocking the canoe.

30:28.933 --> 30:32.357
Status quo is comfortable, I repeat.

30:32.377 --> 30:36.341
Fear the unknown is frightening to too many people.

30:37.161 --> 30:38.683
And of course status quo is

30:39.338 --> 30:48.875
when you talk about food, is a false concept in the first place, because we're 84 million more people every year, and if you stand still, you lose ground.

30:50.177 --> 30:51.599
Well, I got off the track.

30:51.659 --> 30:53.723
Yeah, we're going to get to that, believe me.

30:53.743 --> 30:55.907
We're going to spend a lot of time on that.

30:55.927 --> 31:04.722
In the case of father and mother, father was also

31:05.950 --> 31:11.456
He simply went through the eight grades in the same one-room country school that I went to.

31:11.476 --> 31:14.359
And how far did your grandparents go through school?

31:14.379 --> 31:19.524
So far as I know through this, I think at that time it only went through sixth grade.

31:20.305 --> 31:21.486
Yeah, okay.

31:21.506 --> 31:23.268
Whatever they offered at that time.

31:23.588 --> 31:25.109
I suspect it was sixth grade.

31:27.011 --> 31:33.578
By that time my father arrived, it was eighth grade, and then for two winters he went to the court some

31:35.397 --> 31:45.646
Little, I suppose you would call it a business college.

31:46.367 --> 31:49.330
I don't know the term you would use.

31:49.350 --> 31:53.253
Just for a few, two or three months each winter.

31:53.554 --> 31:55.415
For some kind of short course probably.

31:55.435 --> 31:55.636
Right.

31:56.577 --> 31:59.900
And that was the extent of his education.

31:59.920 --> 32:02.502
My mother more or less the same.

32:02.752 --> 32:04.674
My father was very well-read.

32:04.714 --> 32:22.194
He used to read voraciously, all sorts of things, not just agricultural publications, but all of the magazines at the time, going back to the time of Reader's Digest and Saturday Evening Post and these sorts of things.

32:22.214 --> 32:26.839
And he always listened to the news, the radio.

32:26.879 --> 32:30.463
We had one of the early radios.

32:31.287 --> 32:32.749
around the community.

32:33.029 --> 32:34.190
Do you remember when you got it?

32:35.091 --> 32:35.591
I suppose.

32:37.233 --> 32:38.194
Early 1920s?

32:38.555 --> 32:58.375
Yeah, soon after we moved to this new home, which was 22, it must have been 23 or 24, 24 probably, and I remember it was quite a, for the people in the community, in the cold winter nights you know that the neighbor boys

32:58.878 --> 33:25.797
sometimes the elderly people too would come over and used to have these headsets and you'd take them off and take each one listen to the music or whatever it was it was kind of a rallying point so those things i remember vividly we used to of course walk to school except when the blizzards were too bad then sometimes they'd come from

33:26.148 --> 33:31.015
We'd walk about a mile and a half, close to a mile and three quarters, I guess, each way.

33:32.377 --> 33:34.860
And this was a one-room country school.

33:35.861 --> 33:41.629
It used to have anywhere from 25 to 30 students.

33:41.930 --> 33:47.417
One teacher handled everything from primary to the eighth grade.

33:47.638 --> 33:55.969
Many of the people in the eighth grade were boys who came only during the winter months when there wasn't too much farm work.

33:56.725 --> 34:01.690
And some of them would be 17, 18 years old.

34:02.771 --> 34:14.501
How the school teacher ever kept order in that chaos is beyond me, but I always remember vividly the little willow switch up there on top of the blackboard.

34:14.521 --> 34:23.830
And although I had quite a few teachers during the eight years that I was there, I remember one in particular used to use that

34:24.232 --> 34:31.002
Willis, which whenever she thought that it would be beneficial, there was no nonsense.

34:31.022 --> 34:32.204
Were most of the teachers female?

34:33.165 --> 34:34.487
Mostly female.

34:34.748 --> 34:37.832
As a matter of fact, all of mine were.

34:37.852 --> 34:40.857
Were they usually originally from the community?

34:40.877 --> 34:41.097
No.

34:41.858 --> 34:53.395
They came from either the Cresco High School or the New Hampton High School where they had normal training programs at that time.

34:55.315 --> 34:59.018
Let's get back to your parents now.

34:59.058 --> 34:59.198
Okay.

34:59.419 --> 35:06.585
Okay, we started in and you said that they went through the eighth grade and a little bit of business college after that.

35:06.685 --> 35:10.268
Was that to help them on the farm basically?

35:10.288 --> 35:22.439
I think so far as I could figure out, it had to do with keeping books or something to do with that sort of thing.

35:22.459 --> 35:25.221
And how to write a business letter and these sorts of things.

35:25.741 --> 35:30.386
Now, you said that when you were about eight years old, you moved from the farm.

35:30.967 --> 35:37.894
From the grandparents' farm to the farm where I grew up, which was across the field diagonally.

35:37.914 --> 35:49.506
That farm originally was 56 acres that my father had bought, probably borrowing part of it from grandfather.

35:50.427 --> 35:54.111
But by the time he moved there in 22,

35:54.648 --> 35:55.850
and built these buildings.

35:57.952 --> 36:10.308
We only built the house and the chicken house, milk, cooling place, and a stable, not a barn, and I guess a corn curtain and the rest of it.

36:10.328 --> 36:13.212
But we didn't have, apparently he didn't have enough money to build the barn.

36:13.372 --> 36:15.615
That was not built until 29.

36:16.657 --> 36:20.121
By that time he had paid off his debts, apparently, and he had enough money in the bank.

36:21.463 --> 36:23.085
And just after

36:23.993 --> 36:29.378
They bought all the lumber for the barn, which was built in 29.

36:29.398 --> 36:31.419
The banks went broke.

36:31.439 --> 36:38.265
But he was fortunate that he had this all purchased, and so the barn came into being.

36:38.285 --> 36:43.049
Gradually, I think he bought about 45 acres more, something like that.

36:43.069 --> 36:47.733
So the farm grew to the magnificent size of about 105 acres.

36:47.814 --> 36:48.874
That's all it ever was.

36:49.695 --> 36:53.038
But by then, I should say that

36:53.187 --> 37:00.817
We always, in part, worked with the grand parental farm.

37:00.837 --> 37:03.281
Grandfather was so old then.

37:03.301 --> 37:05.864
Some sort of a partnership in a sense.

37:05.884 --> 37:07.707
Exchange work, loose.

37:07.807 --> 37:08.248
Nothing.

37:08.308 --> 37:11.152
Not a financial partnership.

37:11.172 --> 37:11.232
No.

37:11.252 --> 37:21.726
And shortly after we moved to the little farm where I grew up, my father's brother, Oscar, who was a bachelor, never did marry.

37:22.499 --> 37:27.445
who had been a fireman on one of the railroads.

37:28.726 --> 37:37.217
I think probably, I don't remember if it was Milwaukee or one of the railroads that went through the Midwest.

37:38.058 --> 37:51.814
And he had been lucky and he, on the drawings for the Rosebud Reservation out at Winter, South Dakota, he was one of the numbers that was drawn.

37:52.452 --> 38:00.148
And so he moved out there, he left the railroad and lived there and farmed that area, I don't know how many years.

38:00.168 --> 38:08.425
But after Dad moved to this farm, a couple of years later, he came back to the grand parental farm.

38:09.166 --> 38:12.553
So he used to exchange work and run both of those farms.

38:13.495 --> 38:15.718
Oscar and Henry.

38:15.739 --> 38:18.643
How did your father get along with your grandfather?

38:19.685 --> 38:20.105
Very well.

38:20.145 --> 38:23.370
They never had any clash.

38:23.390 --> 38:28.358
They were very different.

38:28.378 --> 38:30.542
Why did they get along so well?

38:30.562 --> 38:32.905
Children always don't get along so well with their parents.

38:33.306 --> 38:40.397
I guess if I were to try to analyze that, recognizing my

38:41.508 --> 38:45.835
inability to have known what happened when Dad was younger.

38:46.616 --> 38:49.581
I think Dad used to be pretty flexible.

38:49.621 --> 38:55.090
He used to arrive at a point where, well, hell, it's not worth arguing about.

38:55.130 --> 38:59.918
But he was not gutless.

39:00.579 --> 39:05.306
If there was a principal involved, well, he'd speak up, but not nearly so bluntly as grandfather.

39:06.769 --> 39:08.832
Dad was a very kind person.

39:09.250 --> 39:18.083
a very good father, and so was my mother, but my mother was an entirely different person, very quiet and reserved.

39:18.323 --> 39:19.805
Well, let's talk about that.

39:20.206 --> 39:21.348
What do you mean?

39:21.368 --> 39:24.012
Let's talk about the characters, but let's first start on.

39:24.092 --> 39:27.777
What do you mean by saying your father was a good father?

39:27.837 --> 39:37.992
He always provided for our needs within the limits of what he had, but he always insisted that we take care of things.

39:38.343 --> 39:42.747
not throwing our clothes around and ruining them or whatever we happened to have.

39:43.928 --> 39:45.750
That there'd be some orderliness.

39:45.770 --> 39:47.592
But he never was preaching this.

39:47.792 --> 39:54.618
He just taught you some way in an easy sort of way that there were responsibilities.

39:55.679 --> 39:58.241
And you had certain jobs to do.

39:58.622 --> 40:07.590
And I never remember having had an unpleasant discussion with him.

40:08.718 --> 40:09.319
Really?

40:09.339 --> 40:12.141
The whole time you grew up?

40:12.161 --> 40:13.122
Not that I can remember.

40:14.563 --> 40:18.186
Isn't that kind of phenomenal?

40:18.206 --> 40:21.909
I don't know, but I don't remember any such things.

40:22.510 --> 40:23.951
He never crossed words with you?

40:24.551 --> 40:29.516
No, he may have said, look, we've got to get out there and cultivate this corn or something like that.

40:30.096 --> 40:38.303
No goofing off, but never, to my knowledge, anything that was of enough substance so that it left an indelible

40:38.553 --> 40:58.502
mark on and mother on the other hand but dad was the one that decided this is the way we're going to spend our money and this is what we the order of priorities and mother so what was the authority in the household yeah and mother

40:58.786 --> 41:05.074
From an economic standpoint and planning how the monies and how the budget was going to be, budget such as it was.

41:05.134 --> 41:07.277
It wasn't down in black and white necessarily.

41:08.058 --> 41:11.142
But that was the person who got the shots.

41:11.162 --> 41:13.005
So it was a pretty traditional family situation.

41:13.025 --> 41:14.367
Right.

41:14.487 --> 41:18.071
Mother was, as I say, one of eight sisters.

41:18.091 --> 41:18.953
Yeah.

41:18.973 --> 41:21.796
And she was one of the younger ones.

41:23.699 --> 41:26.903
And she was...

41:27.507 --> 41:29.810
Very kind, soft-spoken.

41:31.373 --> 41:38.263
Also, well, I guess both dad and mother were very religious people, really.

41:38.283 --> 41:46.935
They were pretty active in the church, in the women's, what do you call it, ladies' aid or whatever it was.

41:46.955 --> 41:51.642
And dad used to sing in the choir.

41:51.858 --> 41:55.383
He had a good base, and he used to enjoy that.

41:55.403 --> 42:00.630
I always used to remember the Christmas programs, the Christmas Eve programs.

42:01.871 --> 42:08.981
And he enjoyed singing, not just religious songs, but other things.

42:09.581 --> 42:17.612
If there was community gathering, quite often they'd get together and sing.

42:18.638 --> 42:23.565
But did he usually use religion as a disciplinary tool?

42:25.147 --> 42:27.670
How did he use religion?

42:28.071 --> 42:29.433
You say he's a religious man.

42:29.993 --> 42:32.897
And then you said that he liked to sing in the church.

42:32.958 --> 42:34.460
Was it basically social?

42:34.520 --> 42:44.694
No, I think he lived a religious life from that standpoint, from the moral ethics of Lutheranism.

42:44.934 --> 42:46.536
Okay.

42:47.900 --> 42:57.232
I do remember that, I remember when that split in the church was going on, the unpleasantries.

42:57.252 --> 42:59.275
I was too young to capture all of it.

43:00.036 --> 43:02.720
But I used to say to Dan, what's this all about?

43:04.122 --> 43:08.047
Why this big furrow?

43:08.067 --> 43:12.793
And he would try to reduce it to its simplicity with me that, well,

43:13.972 --> 43:22.723
One says that you can't get to heaven in essence, boiling it down to simplicity, by good works alone.

43:23.164 --> 43:29.953
The other one says, well, you better do both, or words to this effect.

43:31.455 --> 43:43.911
In other words, the Missouri Synod was with the basic sin of all, that it had to be on belief that salvation was built on.

43:44.262 --> 43:47.847
that you were a born sinner and that overwhelmed everything.

43:49.008 --> 43:53.975
But it didn't say, on the other hand, that you shouldn't live a good Christian life.

43:54.215 --> 43:56.038
At least this is the way I interpreted it.

43:56.738 --> 44:02.887
And I remember he was trying to explain this to me when this furor was going on in the community.

44:02.907 --> 44:12.379
One thing that I think is interesting about how life was back in that time, from my grandfather's account book, you could see

44:13.540 --> 44:20.368
that they went to the railroad town when my father was young, before I was born, only twice a year.

44:22.030 --> 44:39.531
Once in the fall, apparently before snow came, when they would buy the certain things to carry them through the winter, you could tell by the dates, and then in late winter buy sled before it got muddy, and those

44:39.882 --> 44:44.247
were the times in the fall when they would sell cattle or pigs or whatever.

44:45.929 --> 44:49.454
You could tell from the entrance on their income.

44:51.536 --> 44:52.978
But they sold there.

44:53.479 --> 44:55.521
So they got paid basically twice a year?

44:57.784 --> 44:58.945
Mostly once a year.

44:59.406 --> 45:06.835
The second trip in winter was mostly purchased by for the oncoming summer.

45:08.654 --> 45:13.962
Among my other recollections is what Christmas was like at that time.

45:14.042 --> 45:18.389
You know, I mentioned that we had these Christmas programs and Christmas Eve.

45:19.110 --> 45:23.116
And, of course, the roads were impassable generally because of the snow.

45:23.737 --> 45:24.839
You couldn't drive the cars.

45:24.899 --> 45:26.521
They were Model Ts at that time.

45:28.504 --> 45:37.598
Generally, you'd have to hitch up the sled and the horses and drive to the little church that we belonged to at the village of Saudi.

45:38.371 --> 45:42.695
about five and a half miles.

45:46.519 --> 45:52.865
They had a Christmas tree and the children would put on the Christmas program, the story of Christmas.

45:53.926 --> 46:06.758
Then at the end of this, the children, in addition to depressions that were passed around, got a stocking full of candy.

46:07.598 --> 46:09.341
an orange.
