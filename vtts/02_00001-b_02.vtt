00:02.697 --> 00:07.803
any Williams Presidency fun things?

00:09.505 --> 00:13.150
Things where everybody had a good laugh?

00:15.252 --> 00:16.414
Jokes?

00:16.434 --> 00:18.937
Well, there was a lot of that going on.

00:18.997 --> 00:24.684
I mean, I don't remember any of the meetings being all tight and sterile.

00:24.824 --> 00:27.928
Do you remember anything in the office where everybody had a good laugh?

00:29.782 --> 00:30.683
A couple times.

00:30.984 --> 00:33.267
I'm not sure Dr. Williams was aware of it.

00:34.809 --> 00:36.011
We got Cooper one time.

00:37.613 --> 00:46.426
Cooper came back after, well it must have been a year or so later because Kent was already gone and Roger was there.

00:46.446 --> 00:51.874
And Cooper came in in his usual fashion into my office and

00:52.343 --> 00:53.664
Oh, you want something to drink?

00:53.684 --> 00:55.426
Yeah, bring me a bourbon.

00:55.446 --> 00:56.006
Oh, sure, sure.

00:56.607 --> 01:00.610
So I asked Hillary to bring him a cup of coffee.

01:00.791 --> 01:05.135
Those were the days when secretaries brought you coffee and all.

01:05.155 --> 01:10.960
And so Roger had just gotten back some trip and brought one of the little bottles of bourbon off the airplane.

01:11.220 --> 01:13.962
So they poured it in the coffee cup and brought it in.

01:14.483 --> 01:22.350
And Cooper thought he was getting a cup of coffee and he got a cup of bourbon until he took a sip.

01:22.330 --> 01:26.975
So we got a laugh out of that.

01:27.276 --> 01:30.179
But I don't remember any.

01:30.199 --> 01:40.470
What about, do you remember any events of race or ethnicity or sex during Williams?

01:40.490 --> 01:47.258
How did he feel about, do you remember any problems over women or blacks or anybody else?

01:48.233 --> 01:50.335
No, no, no.

01:51.377 --> 01:53.519
I don't remember any.

01:53.559 --> 01:56.102
All right, and you left the office to go back to physics then.

01:56.482 --> 01:56.703
Yes.

01:57.183 --> 01:59.526
And what was your new task?

01:59.546 --> 02:11.760
Well, as I said earlier, I really enjoyed the secretary of the academic council, and so I went to Dr. Williams and told him it was time for me to go back to physics.

02:12.415 --> 02:20.423
I would like very much to continue on and help him in that area if he wanted me to.

02:21.804 --> 02:26.849
I could continue to be secretary of the academic council.

02:27.850 --> 02:30.733
Of course, I was a bit devious there.

02:32.514 --> 02:39.621
I did enjoy that and I did want to continue in that job, but I also wanted a secretary.

02:40.158 --> 02:47.625
And because I had the secretary situation back in physics was a mess.

02:47.645 --> 02:52.911
And I had a lot of research going on in those days.

02:52.951 --> 02:57.495
And I was writing proposals and publishing papers and those things.

02:57.535 --> 03:01.899
And my secretary there in the president's office did all that work for me.

03:01.919 --> 03:08.646
And now I was going to go back into physics and have to just join in with the secretary of pool.

03:08.795 --> 03:17.314
And so I told Dr. Williams that I'd like to do that, and I'd be willing to do that, but I'd need to set up an office, and I'd need a part-time secretary.

03:18.457 --> 03:23.007
And so he agreed and said, fine, fine, see Dr. Calhoun, tell him you need to.

03:23.864 --> 03:25.607
I need all this.

03:26.709 --> 03:35.923
Dr. Calhoun, I mean, he's always been a real supporter of most anything I did and always helped whenever.

03:35.943 --> 03:37.266
And so he said, yeah, yeah.

03:37.286 --> 03:41.232
So Dr. Calhoun set up a budget for me

03:41.212 --> 03:53.511
to have a half-time secretary pay, I think my salary was paid 25 percent from Dr. Calhoun's account.

03:55.715 --> 04:00.262
So I stayed in that job then until the Faculty Senate came.

04:02.265 --> 04:05.650
And you continued.

04:07.047 --> 04:12.194
During your service in the president's office, you continued to do research?

04:12.214 --> 04:12.395
Yes.

04:13.316 --> 04:14.378
No, I didn't.

04:14.398 --> 04:15.339
But you weren't teaching?

04:15.359 --> 04:16.481
No, no, I was teaching.

04:16.501 --> 04:17.162
Oh, you were teaching?

04:17.202 --> 04:30.000
I never missed a semester teaching until two years ago, and I hired a, the first

04:30.537 --> 04:39.236
female to ever be a full-time faculty member, tenure track faculty member, the physics department, Russian lady.

04:39.256 --> 04:46.431
I sent her an offer on December 15th, and I said, well, she'll never get here before mid-semester or something in the spring.

04:46.451 --> 04:50.740
I'll teach a course, and when she gets here, I'll let her teach it.

04:50.720 --> 04:54.264
She was there January 15th ready to teach.

04:54.504 --> 05:00.531
So how she got through the bureaucracy of Russia and the United States and they're ready to teach, I have no idea.

05:00.972 --> 05:01.973
So I didn't teach that semester.

05:01.993 --> 05:14.848
That's the first semester of teaching I have missed until now and now I have routinely not been, well last year and this year I didn't teach in the fall semester.

05:15.729 --> 05:18.752
Other than that I've always taught and I,

05:18.732 --> 05:29.929
I taught the whole time I was in dean's office, president's office, and I've always been one to push for administrators to teach.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.012
Why do you feel that way?

05:32.212 --> 05:33.494
I'm in total agreement with you.

05:33.514 --> 05:44.270
To keep you and keep them in contact with the real purpose of the university and talking to the students and then they're going to have to interact with faculty if they're teaching.

05:44.290 --> 05:47.335
You know Frank wanted to teach and the board wouldn't let him.

05:47.355 --> 05:47.575
Really?

05:49.124 --> 05:55.050
In my two campus CEO tasks, I told them I would not accept it unless.

05:56.852 --> 06:01.217
And they said in both cases, well, we won't give you extra salary.

06:01.237 --> 06:03.339
And I said, no, I get paid for that.

06:06.022 --> 06:09.545
And I think that that would be a very healthy.

06:11.487 --> 06:11.748
All right.

06:12.809 --> 06:15.992
Looking back now over a third of a century,

06:15.972 --> 06:21.306
How have the students here at Texas A&M changed in that?

06:21.326 --> 06:25.878
I'm not sure I want this on tape.

06:25.898 --> 06:28.765
I am frustrated by the students of today.

06:31.372 --> 06:32.074
They don't want to work.

06:33.404 --> 06:45.709
I think that's a problem in the College of Science because the students can go into less demanding areas and go out and make a lot more money than can the sciences.

06:45.729 --> 06:50.258
And so we don't get the students coming into the sciences, physics in particular.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.763
Okay.

06:52.743 --> 06:59.136
somehow got to handle that problem down the road because we do live in a technical world that's going to get more technical.

06:59.156 --> 07:00.879
And I don't know how the country's going to solve that.

07:00.899 --> 07:08.254
The graduate students in physics within the past year and a half have completely changed.

07:08.234 --> 07:19.050
Whereas we used to get this is going to represent the United States citizen graduate student in physics, this is a foreign.

07:19.390 --> 07:21.213
They've now crossed.

07:21.233 --> 07:28.543
In physics across the country, there are more international students in physics graduate school than there are American students in graduate school.

07:28.563 --> 07:31.187
And if the trend continues, they're going to

07:31.167 --> 07:38.197
And I think that it's a sign of the times that people don't want to work.

07:39.438 --> 07:42.423
Our graduate students don't work the way they did years ago.

07:43.444 --> 07:51.575
And our graduate students, it's pretty much an eight-hour day and weekends off.

07:51.595 --> 07:53.698
And I'm assuming this is not a unique day and end.

07:53.678 --> 07:54.759
Oh, no.

07:54.779 --> 07:56.241
I'm sure not.

07:56.782 --> 07:59.085
But that's not the question.

07:59.105 --> 08:02.169
The question has to do, I think, mostly with the undergraduate students.

08:03.110 --> 08:05.913
And I am frustrated with our admissions policy.

08:06.774 --> 08:13.223
I would much rather open the front door wider and open the back door wider.

08:14.144 --> 08:18.249
I would like to let these kids in here and find out who wants to work and who doesn't want to work.

08:18.329 --> 08:21.593
And it doesn't really correlate with their SAT scores.

08:22.248 --> 08:28.117
And then after one year, if they haven't dug in and worked, then I'd like to fail them out.

08:29.018 --> 08:34.587
And I find it very frustrating that we have kids out there who want to work but they can't get in this university.

08:34.607 --> 08:41.337
And the ones who do come in are here and they're not here to work.

08:41.907 --> 08:50.836
Now they may be much brighter kids than I was getting in the classroom 15 years ago, but they don't work like they did 15 years ago.

08:51.577 --> 08:55.681
And that to me is very, very frustrating.

08:56.362 --> 09:06.613
I teach a course, you were asking about what I taught early on, but now I'm teaching a course that is a third semester course for engineering students, mostly electrical engineering students.

09:07.414 --> 09:10.497
Until five years ago, I never failed anybody.

09:11.978 --> 09:13.280
I shouldn't say it that way.

09:13.300 --> 09:14.961
Nobody ever failed if they took my class.

09:15.202 --> 09:16.603
I've never failed anybody in my life.

09:17.464 --> 09:30.620
But if a kid came in and stayed with me and took all the exams, did all the homework, that kid finished the course with a passing grade.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.262
It's not the case now.

09:32.282 --> 09:36.306
They come in and they don't want to work.

09:36.326 --> 09:37.868
So they come into the exam and they fail it.

09:39.029 --> 09:44.374
Why they bothered to come back for the second and third exams, I have not a clue, because they don't change.

09:44.755 --> 09:47.637
They don't take that as a sign they've got to go to work.

09:47.657 --> 09:54.845
And so, at the end of the semester, I failed 10 percent or so of the class, whereas 15 years ago, I never failed anybody.

09:55.605 --> 09:55.705
Yeah.

09:55.725 --> 10:07.517
Today, when they, as far as you're aware, when they arrive on the campus, are they better prepared in general than they were 25 years ago?

10:07.868 --> 10:09.350
In words, they have the capability?

10:09.370 --> 10:10.331
I suspect they are.

10:10.712 --> 10:13.095
I don't really know, but I suspect they are.

10:13.916 --> 10:29.556
I don't think they came in better prepared 15 years ago, except that 15 years ago, all of society was not this soft, and the big money wasn't out there for the easy taking.

10:30.413 --> 10:39.026
Now, and that big money is particularly the explanation for the decline in American national graduate students.

10:39.046 --> 10:41.851
They didn't get a good job right out of their undergraduate days.

10:42.211 --> 10:47.559
Well, maybe some of that, but more of that is they don't have to work as hard.

10:47.599 --> 10:51.325
They can go into,

10:51.305 --> 10:58.054
business, they can go into, I mean a business college, not into business themselves, but they can go to the business college.

10:58.915 --> 11:00.857
They're bright kids, good grades, they can get in.

11:01.738 --> 11:15.096
And you don't have to work as hard in, I don't think it's my prejudice saying that, but you can make your grades in a general business course or an accounting course.

11:16.838 --> 11:20.923
But it takes a lot of work to

11:22.220 --> 11:27.590
make good grades in advanced physics courses, but I'm not, I mean, the lower level courses.

11:28.111 --> 11:34.202
I think that my kids, when I get them third semester physics, some of them have never had to think.

11:34.222 --> 11:35.404
They just have not.

11:35.424 --> 11:41.796
They really, some of them want to work, but they're, some of them, those who want to work, some of them don't know how.

11:41.816 --> 11:45.763
They've never had to really work.

11:47.347 --> 11:51.432
They've never had to really analyze something.

11:51.452 --> 11:56.798
If they've worked a problem, and I give them a problem similar to that on the exam, fine.

11:57.740 --> 12:05.529
But if you change it up to where there's some logic between this one and this one, they're lost.

12:05.549 --> 12:09.574
They're lost.

12:12.355 --> 12:19.963
You can probably see most of the problem if you go around to some of these beer halls on Thursday night, because the weekend starts on Thursdays.

12:20.924 --> 12:37.080
Thursday night's a big party night, and then, of course, the weekends you don't want to work, and then Sunday, you know, you're going to party some and go swimming and something, and then Monday, you're about to start thinking about there's something to do, but now you've got to go to class again, and there's new material.

12:37.398 --> 12:39.820
So, it's a sign of the time.

12:39.860 --> 12:47.507
So, I suspect the students we're bringing in are whiter than they were 15, 20, 30 years ago.

12:47.587 --> 12:48.728
I suspect they are.

12:48.748 --> 12:49.909
And they're not as determined.

12:49.969 --> 12:55.634
But economically, they're more nearly from middle class.

12:55.934 --> 12:57.295
They're not as?

12:57.315 --> 12:58.076
Yeah.

12:58.316 --> 13:01.839
I think they're certainly better off than they were financially.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.381
The families are better off than they were.

13:03.681 --> 13:05.903
I mean, we're living in booming times.

13:05.883 --> 13:07.886
All right.

13:07.906 --> 13:10.991
In the quarter century, you've been back in the department.

13:12.353 --> 13:21.428
How has the department, what areas of emphasis, growth described the department during that quarter century?

13:21.728 --> 13:24.392
Well, the department has gone up and come back down.

13:25.334 --> 13:33.427
If you look at the numbers, we peaked out six, seven years ago with 46 faculty members.

13:33.928 --> 13:37.533
We're down to 36 or 37 now.

13:37.553 --> 13:40.839
We peaked out at 155 or 60 graduate students.

13:40.999 --> 13:43.843
We're down to 100 now.

13:43.863 --> 13:49.272
Our undergraduate program is very small now.

13:49.252 --> 13:52.393
110, 120 undergraduate students

13:53.302 --> 13:54.163
10 years ago.

13:54.243 --> 13:55.885
We're down to maybe 50.

13:58.708 --> 14:00.170
I think it's the same thing.

14:00.190 --> 14:04.856
Nobody wanted to work that hard to... Is that nationally?

14:06.177 --> 14:07.138
Yeah.

14:07.158 --> 14:14.067
And this crossover I'm telling you about for the international students in graduate school, that's certainly here and national.

14:15.128 --> 14:22.937
The undergraduate student body is across the country down in physics, probably in all the

14:22.917 --> 14:27.102
I haven't paid much attention to the other technical areas, but physics is down.

14:29.024 --> 14:51.270
We took the big boost from the Sputnik days and had the heydays of science all through all of the moon stuff, which had nothing to do with science, but still everybody thought it did, so it was booming times for science.

14:52.938 --> 14:54.500
Numbers are down.

14:55.481 --> 14:56.722
Faculty numbers are down.

14:57.723 --> 15:01.127
We have four strong areas in the department.

15:01.207 --> 15:02.088
Yeah, describe those.

15:02.808 --> 15:08.034
We have nuclear physics, which is centered around the cyclotron next door.

15:09.335 --> 15:14.521
And we have a strong, strong group there, one of the strongest in the country.

15:14.541 --> 15:18.405
There are not very many in the country with accelerators on campus.

15:18.385 --> 15:23.231
We have a high-energy physics group, theory and experiment.

15:23.992 --> 15:30.842
Our experimental group has work going on all over the world.

15:30.862 --> 15:35.107
We have work going on at Fermi Lab.

15:35.127 --> 15:38.812
We have work going on in Grand Sasso in Italy.

15:38.832 --> 15:41.035
We have work going on at CERN.

15:41.015 --> 15:51.828
Switzerland, and we have an exceptional group of high-energy theorists.

15:52.969 --> 16:02.601
Lost our big gun or one of the big guns last year to Michigan, but we have a condensed matter group that

16:03.813 --> 16:07.096
It is quite strong, aging, but strong.

16:08.037 --> 16:11.900
We have an atomic group that is really booming.

16:14.562 --> 16:23.090
It's lots of laser work, laser development, as well as using lasers in the research.

16:23.810 --> 16:27.533
We have very strong experimental group, very strong theory group.

16:27.553 --> 16:32.858
Fry, who I'll be talking about on Friday, is in the atomic experimental group.

16:34.323 --> 16:42.435
Are there any areas that, in hindsight, that the department should have emphasized more than there has?

16:43.296 --> 16:44.498
Yes, in my opinion.

16:45.059 --> 16:56.736
I think we missed the boat to some extent 15 years ago when the Texas electronics industry was booming.

16:56.716 --> 17:01.726
I think we would have been better served to have gone into condensed matter in a strong way.

17:02.668 --> 17:08.059
Instead, we went to high energy physics, which was the choice of the Department at the time.

17:09.141 --> 17:18.420
I think we would be better off now if we had gone that direction, built some alliances with Texas Instrument and the Dallas complex.

17:18.400 --> 17:37.557
We lost a faculty member to that area because he felt the same way and finally built his own ties to Texas Instrument and then he resigned here and took a position at Tarleton, not Tarleton, Arlington, so he could be in the Dallas

17:37.537 --> 17:44.133
area, and he still has strong ties going with Texas Instrument, and he's building a program there.

17:45.376 --> 17:50.247
Even though that's a school much weaker than we are, but for him the location was important.

17:51.188 --> 17:57.615
Who are the other truly big league physics departments in a three or five?

17:57.635 --> 18:01.919
The University of Texas certainly is a renowned physics department.

18:03.842 --> 18:08.346
Rice, to some extent, but has lost some in recent years.

18:12.671 --> 18:18.377
Other than that, you've got to go quite a distance.

18:19.623 --> 18:22.048
Where, Georgia Tech?

18:22.068 --> 18:23.030
Tulane?

18:23.050 --> 18:28.039
No, but Cornell, Stanford, Penn State.

18:28.059 --> 18:30.584
Have we been ranked in the recent rankings?

18:30.604 --> 18:33.109
Physics.

18:35.890 --> 18:38.774
Oh, 30th, 40th, somewhere in there probably.

18:38.794 --> 18:40.918
We've got lots of talk about getting in the top 20.

18:42.500 --> 18:43.161
What would it take?

18:43.942 --> 18:49.711
Oh, lots of money, which is hard to get out of this administration for physics right now.

18:49.731 --> 18:53.958
You read the 2020, it doesn't have much in there for physics.

18:55.380 --> 18:57.223
I have a committee going now that's

18:57.203 --> 18:59.787
supposed to be plotting the future of the department.

18:59.867 --> 19:01.329
I've stepped down.

19:01.369 --> 19:02.631
I don't know if I mentioned that to you.

19:02.831 --> 19:03.432
No, I didn't.

19:03.452 --> 19:05.395
Yeah.

19:05.415 --> 19:11.303
I told the dean, I told the faculty that it was time for us to get a new department head.

19:12.585 --> 19:16.731
I'll give you some history of how I got in this job.

19:17.369 --> 19:20.474
So you came back to the department in what year?

19:20.494 --> 19:23.318
I came back in 75.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.944
And you became department head when?

19:26.964 --> 19:36.238
Well, in 75 Gil Ploss was department head and I was in the department and then

19:36.910 --> 19:38.974
A decision was made.

19:38.994 --> 19:44.324
Prescott decided to make a change in department head in physics, formed a search committee.

19:44.344 --> 19:45.626
I chaired that search committee.

19:46.348 --> 19:51.818
After a search, we didn't come up with anybody, and so Prescott named me interim head.

19:52.259 --> 19:56.607
So I followed Gil Ploss in, but I was an interim head.

19:56.941 --> 19:58.663
supposedly be in for a year.

19:58.683 --> 20:00.686
I wound up staying in two years.

20:00.706 --> 20:06.293
And then we still didn't find anybody from the outside, so we named Bob Tribble Department Head.

20:06.313 --> 20:10.999
And Tribble was Department Head for eight or nine years.

20:11.019 --> 20:22.273
And then we had a semi-search for Department Head, and Fackler, in my opinion, caved in, didn't want to

20:22.777 --> 20:28.050
worked that hard, so he just named one of the internal people department head.

20:29.192 --> 20:32.159
That was Dick Ornewitt.

20:32.179 --> 20:32.881
What's his name?

20:32.901 --> 20:35.948
Ornewitt, A-R-N-O-W-I-T-T.

20:35.968 --> 20:39.216
And Ornewitt was department head for

20:41.052 --> 20:49.804
eight or nine years, and dictatorial type person who did nothing for anybody except high energy.

20:49.884 --> 20:52.427
Salaries were way out of line.

20:52.447 --> 21:09.169
Lots and lots of tension in the department, feuding, and so with the new dean, Dick Ewing, first thing he did was to make a decision to replace Dick Arnwick.

21:09.740 --> 21:16.071
at least I think he did, the first thing he did when he came in was to ask me to chair a committee to do an evaluation

21:17.182 --> 21:23.252
of Dick Arnewitt, as is called for in the Rules and Regulations of the University.

21:24.314 --> 21:42.666
I told Ewing, working through Mike Kemp in those days, I told Mike that he had to go and tell Ewing, who wasn't yet on campus, that I would chair the committee, but he had to understand that I thought that Dick Arnewitt was the worst administrator on campus who had ever been on campus.

21:42.646 --> 21:53.899
and that I would chair the committee and try to be fair, but I couldn't guarantee complete objectivity and that they might be better served by finding somebody else to chair the committee.

21:55.083 --> 21:57.229
Well, they decided they wanted me to chair it anyhow.

21:57.817 --> 22:08.649
Dick Ewing called Dick Ornewitt over to tell him that he had named a committee or was getting ready to ask the faculty to name a committee to do the evaluation.

22:09.470 --> 22:25.427
Dick Ornewitt came back over to the faculty and asked the associate department head to call a faculty meeting that he would not attend and to tell the faculty that he needed some help in his fight against the dean and he needed devoted confidence.

22:25.508 --> 22:30.259
In my opinion, that was to go back to the dean and say, see, I have a vote of compass.

22:30.279 --> 22:31.602
You don't need to evaluate me.

22:33.667 --> 22:40.243
I think Ewing had already made up his mind he was going to replace him, but he wanted to have an evaluation to confirm what he was thinking.

22:41.472 --> 22:49.274
So I chaired that committee, which was a real, the worst semester I've spent at Texas A&M was that semester.

22:52.503 --> 22:55.532
But finally,

22:56.963 --> 23:02.490
The decision was made, evaluation was in, most of the faculty was wanted to change.

23:03.332 --> 23:09.961
And so Ewing wrote him a letter that he was out as of January 5th, be replaced by Bob Webb.

23:09.981 --> 23:15.488
And so on January 5th, Bob Webb came down here to occupy the department head's office.

23:17.130 --> 23:20.575
And Arnold wouldn't leave the office.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.310
And didn't I tell the story the other day?

23:24.592 --> 23:31.081
And so he just stayed there, and Webb said, Dick, we can help you pack up your things.

23:31.101 --> 23:31.642
No response.

23:32.823 --> 23:35.928
I went off to an NCAA meeting with Mobley.

23:36.869 --> 23:43.859
So I came back on Tuesday of that week and called in, and the thing was still going on.

23:43.879 --> 23:47.744
Bob Webb had set up office in the conference room, running the department.

23:48.766 --> 23:50.528
And Arnold wouldn't leave the office.

23:52.550 --> 23:59.460
And so I went back and sat down by Mobley and said, Mr. President, I'd like to tell you what's going on on your campus.

23:59.480 --> 24:02.845
The old physics department head is refusing to leave the office.

24:03.365 --> 24:05.649
The new department head has the office under siege.

24:06.089 --> 24:06.910
I'll keep you posted.

24:09.634 --> 24:18.507
On Friday, Dick Ardoin went off to a physics meeting, and Bob Webb had the shop people come up, pack up his things, and move him out of the office.

24:19.583 --> 24:25.048
Bob Webb lasted as interim department head for a year and a half, I guess.

24:25.369 --> 24:29.933
And then he, the attention was still here for the faculty's salaries.

24:30.974 --> 24:41.325
And he went in front of the faculty and told them that nobody had received a raise except A, B, C, and D. The next morning, we had a Xerox copy of the budget in our mailboxes.

24:41.345 --> 24:46.890
The faculty member had gone to the library showing that one of

24:46.870 --> 24:52.898
the controversial people had received a 10% pay raise.

24:52.918 --> 24:54.340
And that day Bob Webb resigned.

24:55.241 --> 25:05.975
And so we had a few weeks, months search for internal person to be interim department head and I was that person.

25:06.035 --> 25:09.179
So I was voted in to take the interim job.

25:09.199 --> 25:12.403
So I took the job and for two years I was the interim department head.

25:12.423 --> 25:14.065
And that's when?

25:14.085 --> 25:15.527
Oh, starting in

25:17.077 --> 25:24.835
So then I became permanent head in 96, I guess.

25:25.938 --> 25:26.258
All right.

25:26.278 --> 25:32.493
As department head, what were your philosophical guidelines for what the role of the permanent head was?

25:32.513 --> 25:36.081
Well, mine were fairly narrow because of the times

25:36.618 --> 25:38.402
we had going on.

25:38.422 --> 25:45.957
First of all it was important to get an outside evaluation committee to come in and do an evaluation and we did that while I was interim head.

25:46.919 --> 25:49.665
And the other part of my

25:51.012 --> 25:56.099
job was to cool the temperature of the department down because everybody was at everybody's throat.

25:56.119 --> 26:03.008
And so I came in with the goal of calming the place down and getting us ready for department head.

26:04.470 --> 26:07.034
And so that's what I did as an interim head.

26:07.054 --> 26:17.728
And then we had the evaluation committee come in, and I was the first one to testify in front of the evaluation committee, and I told them that there was no member of this faculty who should be department head.

26:17.708 --> 26:26.419
that we had to go outside and bring in a department head from outside who could bring this department together and carry us into the future.

26:26.440 --> 26:39.717
And they completely ignored that advice and at the end of their report they recommended to the dean that we hire internal because we'd been in an interim situation for four years and we should get that over with and we should name someone permanent head.

26:39.697 --> 26:59.840
And so at that time I made a decision that, well, I certainly didn't think anybody here, including me, should be the department head, and that since the committee recommended to the dean, and the dean was going to take that recommendation and name somebody head from internal, that I was the only one that I thought should do the job.

26:59.860 --> 27:08.050
And so I, there were four of us who ran, and the vote went my way, and so the dean appointed me the department head, and I agreed to a one four-year term.

27:08.030 --> 27:10.096
And so this is my fourth year.

27:11.922 --> 27:20.267
As the title department head, did you feel that your role was to make decisions

27:22.154 --> 27:26.699
whether they were democratically the most popular or not.

27:26.800 --> 27:27.701
Were you the chairman?

27:27.761 --> 27:27.881
No.

27:27.901 --> 27:28.942
I'm chairman.

27:28.962 --> 27:29.423
I'm a chairman.

27:29.603 --> 27:31.505
Are you bound by the department's?

27:31.806 --> 27:32.446
I'm not bound.

27:33.067 --> 27:36.211
I'm not bound, but I take it as strong recommendation.

27:36.451 --> 27:37.212
Okay.

27:37.232 --> 27:43.099
And I've done that because of the prior administration.

27:43.079 --> 27:44.220
Okay.

27:44.240 --> 27:57.016
Involving nobody in decisions, having committees that thought they were doing things, but there was one year that the salary increases were already over in the dean's office.

27:57.036 --> 28:01.161
The committee over here was still working on them, but the faculty didn't know they were in the dean's office.

28:01.182 --> 28:04.205
I knew they were in the dean's office, but nobody else knew they were over there.

28:04.225 --> 28:10.453
And so a lot of it was suffrage, and so it was my intent

28:10.771 --> 28:16.985
to come in as a chair and salary increases have been handled as a chair.

28:17.146 --> 28:21.315
I have a raise committee.

28:21.335 --> 28:25.465
Each year I have held out some of the money.

28:25.485 --> 28:29.033
When I first came into the job I held out 25-30% of the money.

28:29.013 --> 28:34.283
and the committee made recommendations that became salary increases.

28:34.303 --> 28:47.207
The other change I made was that salary increases are not given on percentage of present salary, but are given on increments of money, which favors the lower paid faculty at the expense of the higher paid faculty.

28:47.187 --> 28:53.137
But there were inequities in salaries.

28:53.217 --> 29:01.731
We had faculty members here whose only sin was they had been at Texas A&M, making far less than those who had come in more recently.

29:02.452 --> 29:10.225
And so the first thing I did in the job as interim head was to give a raise to 12 of our old-time faculty members.

29:10.205 --> 29:19.335
And those raises were mid-year raises and averaged some 6% or so, and that was my first step.

29:19.355 --> 29:29.226
And then every year, up until about this year, I've taken out a diminishing percentage of salaries to address inequities as I saw them.

29:29.246 --> 29:35.132
Other than that, the committee makes recommendations that I use to then make salary increases, so I've been a chairman.

29:35.112 --> 29:48.143
making some decisions, but mostly I took it as my job to get the morale of the faculty back up, to get the faculty where they could work together to find a department head

29:49.068 --> 29:54.078
that I hope would be still from outside who would come back in and come in here and give us the leadership we need.

29:54.439 --> 29:57.425
I don't think that I'm the leader to do these things.

29:57.625 --> 30:05.862
What indications have you found that cause you to be optimistic about the success of the way you try to do it?

30:06.432 --> 30:10.839
I think we're certainly working more together now.

30:10.979 --> 30:29.790
Of course, the real test is coming now because we now are being forced to write up a long-range plan, and we're being forced to come to some decisions about a new department head that I hope we are now

30:30.226 --> 30:35.874
far enough along in the healing process that we can do in a good fashion.

30:36.615 --> 30:38.739
And the test will be to see how we get through this.

30:38.759 --> 30:47.111
If we get through this reasonably well and coherently and choose a new department head, then I'll feel that I've been successful in what I set out to do.

30:47.732 --> 30:59.389
In your task as a physicist, be it a department head or just faculty, what have been some of your highest moments, most satisfying moments?

30:59.369 --> 31:07.138
Well, with the students certainly, seeing the students who do develop my favorite story, I'll tell you.

31:08.720 --> 31:13.365
I had a young man in class probably 12 years ago.

31:13.405 --> 31:14.006
I've lost track.

31:15.268 --> 31:23.217
And I tell this story about how I arrived in physics, and I tell it not only just because I
