00:03.811 --> 00:10.100
But again, like I say, my whole two years was 
fighting in the north, but I was over there in 67,

00:03.811 --> 00:10.100
68, 69, and 70. That was the time of the heaviest 
fighting prior to 72 when they came across the

00:10.140 --> 00:17.391
border once the U.S. forces were gone. We never 
lost a battle. We inflicted major injury on the

00:20.655 --> 00:24.100
enemy. I think if you – and I don't like to use the 
word body counting, though you probably read a lot

00:25.422 --> 00:30.750
about body count in Vietnam. I wasn't involved in 
body count. If you look at casualties, the

00:33.224 --> 00:42.114
American forces lost right around 56,000, maybe 
it's 58,000. But they believe the North

00:42.134 --> 00:46.999
Vietnamese lost up in the 300,000 troops.

00:50.023 --> 00:52.025
We just had a greater military might. We had the 
ability to inflict massive destruction on the

00:52.386 --> 00:58.152
enemy any time we're in contact. As a man, 
especially when I was flying OB-10s, where I was

00:59.971 --> 01:07.519
the tackle air controller airborne, and just to 
see the might that come down. You get a troop of

01:07.619 --> 01:12.184
friendly forces in contact with the enemy. Like I 
mentioned earlier, it was just a matter of seconds

01:13.226 --> 01:18.371
before, you know, artillery rounds, naval 
gunfire rounds. At one time, I remember one time we

01:18.431 --> 01:23.537
had a Marine regiment that was fighting an NVA 
division. I had 23 flights of fixed-wing stacked

01:24.278 --> 01:27.261
overhead. I mean,

01:27.629 --> 01:38.102
that's the type of power we had. So in answer to your 
question, I can say that mainly we... I'm not aware

01:42.547 --> 01:47.253
of us losing any battles, but I would have to say 
overall we lost the war. And I say we lost the war. I

01:49.556 --> 01:51.939
don't think it's the American military that lost 
the war. It's the American people that lost the

01:52.700 --> 01:55.543
war. Because, number one, they didn't fight it 
right. They just didn't fight it right. And you

02:02.617 --> 02:05.681
have to blame that on the politicians. And, of 
course, then once the war was going on, they had

02:05.701 --> 02:15.475
to—the reason we're out of there is because the

02:05.701 --> 02:15.475
American people said we don't want our military 
over there. Sir, I'd like to thank you for your

02:15.495 --> 02:17.017
time. That concludes this interview. Okay. Well, 
if you have any questions on Vietnam, I know it's a

02:19.380 --> 02:23.185
short interview.
