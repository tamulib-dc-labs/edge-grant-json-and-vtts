00:02.107 --> 00:16.905
This

00:02.107 --> 00:16.905
is Professor Larry Hoover of Sam Houston State 
University, November 15, 1984. This interview

00:17.065 --> 00:24.013
concerns crowd control and changes in crowd 
control during the 1960s. Dr. Hoover, could you

00:24.702 --> 00:33.375
please give me your background, such as where you 
were born and when schools attended, and how you

00:24.702 --> 00:33.375
made your way to Sam Houston State University? I 
was born in 1945 and raised in the state of

00:33.395 --> 00:41.066
Michigan. I entered college at Michigan State 
University, majoring in what was then called

00:50.757 --> 00:52.579
police administration and public safety. Since 
that time, all these programs have modified the

00:53.159 --> 01:01.228
terminology to reflect criminal justice as the 
title of the degree. Intending to go to law school

01:01.288 --> 01:11.097
at the University of Michigan, completed my 
degree in police science administration and was

01:01.288 --> 01:11.097
out of money. So I went to work for the Lansing, 
Michigan Police Department. Lansing, Michigan

01:14.901 --> 01:16.663
is the city of a metropolitan area of about 
200,000, very much like Austin, Texas. It's the

01:21.487 --> 01:22.910
capital city of the state. It has a large 
university there. Unlike Austin, there's a fair

01:26.595 --> 01:30.662
amount of heavy industry in that area, the 
automobile industry.

01:34.168 --> 01:43.883
Went on to police department, given my major, went 
on to police department and intended to stay about

01:34.168 --> 01:43.883
six months, save up money, and then go on to law 
school. One thing led to another and ended up

01:44.150 --> 01:46.634
staying in police work. Went back out to Michigan 
State, took a master's degree in what was then

01:46.674 --> 01:58.972
called criminal justice, then received a PhD in 
higher educational administration. Spent

01:59.914 --> 02:12.773
approximately four years on the Lansing Police 
Department in several capacities, primarily in

01:59.914 --> 02:12.773
the police patrol division, however. and left 
there for the Michigan Law Enforcement Officers

02:13.478 --> 02:17.562
Training Council. It's a state organization 
which controls, coordinates police training in

02:17.802 --> 02:22.847
that state. There are analogous organizations in 
every state now, including Texas. Spent a year and

02:28.552 --> 02:42.945
a half there, and then went on the faculty at 
Michigan State University for five years, and

02:28.552 --> 02:42.945
left there in 1977, came to Sam Houston State 
University, where I'm now a professor of criminal

02:28.552 --> 02:42.945
justice here. What riots have you been in and how 
were you involved?

02:52.781 --> 03:00.571
I was on the patrol officer in the Lansing Michigan 
Police Department between 1967 and 1971.

03:02.934 --> 03:10.224
In that time period we experienced two distinct 
kinds of disturbances. One were the Riots, I guess

03:15.578 --> 03:26.776
if we could call them that, in the black 
neighborhoods, the black ghetto riots of the late

03:15.578 --> 03:26.776
60s, which did occur in Lansing as well as other 
cities. Of course, the riots in Detroit received

03:26.836 --> 03:35.950
national attention when army units had to be 
called in to finally restore order in Detroit.

03:38.180 --> 03:48.673
Forty-some people died in the disturbances in 
Detroit, but virtually every other city in

03:38.180 --> 03:48.673
Michigan at that time experienced similar 
disturbances, although on, obviously, a smaller

03:38.180 --> 03:48.673
scale. A second kind of disturbance were the 
demonstrations with regard to the United States'

03:50.035 --> 03:57.264
involvement in the Vietnam War. With a very large 
university, Michigan State University,

03:57.884 --> 04:06.375
immediately adjacent to the city of Lansing, we 
experienced several uh... disturbances

04:06.541 --> 04:27.891
demonstrations which became disturbances and 
uh... i participated in i suppose three or four of

04:06.541 --> 04:27.891
those in terms of trying to affect crowd control 
the ghetto riots are a little hard more difficult

04:06.541 --> 04:27.891
to to to quantify uh... in lansing we did not 
experience a a uh... a riot which had a given time

04:28.748 --> 04:33.534
frame to place around it. It wasn't as if we had 
three days of looting and burning, but rather

04:33.635 --> 04:46.331
throughout the summer of 1968 and summer of 1969, 
we experienced periodic disturbances. And I

04:47.012 --> 04:56.144
suppose I ended up in riot gear and assigned to that 
area 20 times during those two summers. OK. How did

04:58.617 --> 05:02.824
you as a policeman feel going into a riot or 
potential riot situation? Afraid. Afraid. I

05:05.107 --> 05:19.950
think one of the things that is not well understood 
about confrontations between police and crowds,

05:05.107 --> 05:19.950
hostile crowds, demonstrators, is the amount of 
fear that the police have. You see the police

05:20.420 --> 05:32.135
appear in riot gear with helmets and with batons, 
sidearms on their waist. They come out in force, 50

05:33.837 --> 05:48.655
or 60 officers, and the assumption is made that 
those individuals are calm, cool, collected, are

05:33.837 --> 05:48.655
perfectly confident of their own safety. 
Whenever that's not the case, in fact, they're

05:49.175 --> 05:52.561
very much afraid. One of the anomalies of 
attempting to control civil disturbances is the

05:53.583 --> 06:06.745
fact that a police officer is limited in the amount 
of force that he can use. the fact that you have a gun

06:07.096 --> 06:32.428
with you is probably the greatest threat that you 
experience because the overwhelming fear is that

06:07.096 --> 06:32.428
the crowd will manage to isolate you, will either 
beat and kick you to death, which has occurred, or

06:07.096 --> 06:32.428
someone will grab your firearm, someone will grab 
your revolver and use it on you. So the police,

06:33.033 --> 06:38.561
whenever they approach that kind of a situation, 
they're scared to death. And they react

06:39.722 --> 06:41.024
appropriately. And I think that's something we 
need to understand about the psychology of crowd

06:41.044 --> 06:52.881
control, is that in any textbook one looks at, 
articles about this issue, that are entitled

06:53.688 --> 06:58.875
Psychology of Crowd Control, it's a one-way 
perspective. It's written about the psychology

06:58.916 --> 07:03.222
of the crowd, not the psychology of the 
controlling agents. And dealing with the

07:04.263 --> 07:14.177
psychology of the controlling agents and the fear 
that they have is every bit as important as dealing

07:04.263 --> 07:14.177
with the crowd. I recall on an anecdotal basis, I 
can't resist noting, that there was a massive

07:19.996 --> 07:26.505
march scheduled from the campus of Michigan State 
University to the State Capitol building in

07:19.996 --> 07:26.505
Lansing. It's a distance probably of four miles, I 
would guess. And of course, every law enforcement

07:31.552 --> 07:35.677
agency in the area were mobilized. And consistent 
with policy at that time, one had a minimum number,

07:35.917 --> 07:44.930
as long as the demonstration was peaceful, one had 
a minimum number of officers on the street. You

07:45.010 --> 07:46.712
tried to keep a very low profile so that you didn't 
beget confrontation, so it did not appear as

07:47.114 --> 08:00.129
though you were challenging the crowd's right to 
assemble, freedom of speech. And so a few officers

08:01.030 --> 08:13.945
were assigned for traffic control to escort them 
down the main street of town, similar to Congress

08:01.030 --> 08:13.945
Avenue over in Austin, if you're familiar with 
that. What year was this? Best of my recollection,

08:16.544 --> 08:34.452
this would have been 1968,

08:16.544 --> 08:34.452
part of the series of demonstrations occurring 
around the country in conjunction with the

08:16.544 --> 08:34.452
Democratic National Convention and so forth.

08:36.710 --> 08:42.441
They had a group of us, probably 50, 60 officers. We 
were assembled in the basement of City Hall. If we

08:47.111 --> 08:50.357
were needed, if the crowd became unruly, then they 
would muster us. We would have been mustered out to

08:50.377 --> 08:54.004
try to effect control. And an officer next to me had 
a reasonable sense of humor. turned and, I have to

08:57.905 --> 09:03.354
add, we just told that the estimated size of the 
crowd was 20,000. And the officer next to me turned

09:04.175 --> 09:12.568
and said, well, there's altogether maybe 100 of 
us. Given 20,000 of them, that means we're

09:13.490 --> 09:18.057
outnumbered 201. I just wanted to tell you, 
though, that you're outnumbered 400 to 1 because

09:18.678 --> 09:23.688
I'm going to turn and run like hell. And it's that 
story. We laughed about it, but it was kind of

09:28.718 --> 09:39.218
laughing about it that was done in a sort of a, oh, 
I'm not quite sure what the right term is, but there

09:28.718 --> 09:39.218
was a certain amount of, real fear that went, we 
were laughing at death staring in the face, and it

09:41.543 --> 09:48.532
really wasn't all that humorous. Yes, 
definitely. Did the feeling of placement change

09:51.636 --> 09:57.843
over the sixties, or was it pretty much the same? 
Well, I think we got, as we gained experience with

09:57.863 --> 10:11.280
it, we became more confident, and more competent 
and confident, both, and one is certainly as

09:57.863 --> 10:11.280
important as the other, related to one another. 
recognized that most police officers

10:11.733 --> 10:28.341
right now, in 1984, had never experienced an 
unruly crowd of any size, and never had to affect

10:11.733 --> 10:28.341
crowd control where they were stirring it up, a 
large demonstration. In American society, these

10:28.625 --> 10:35.159
events occur sporadically enough, even in times 
of, relatively speaking, civil unrest. They're

10:35.179 --> 10:39.569
still rare enough that most officers have not had 
experience in dealing with them. Most

10:39.589 --> 10:42.676
departments have not had experience in dealing 
with them. Consequently, you make all the classic

10:43.016 --> 10:48.388
mistakes those first couple times around. 
Generally speaking, by the time you've gained

10:48.638 --> 10:51.925
experience, it's all over with. The issue has 
passed. It's been the history since, certainly in

10:55.492 --> 10:59.500
the last 20 years at least. Whatever the issue has 
been has become moot, and the opportunity to pass

10:59.540 --> 11:08.638
that experience along does not exist. Now, in 
terms of specific tactical changes, I would say

11:09.108 --> 11:14.016
no. The tactics that were used were probably the 
same throughout. The difference was in terms of

11:17.842 --> 11:25.174
the way those tactics were employed, the 
confidence with which we approached the scenes,

11:17.842 --> 11:25.174
how competent we were. We knew the right things to 
do. That is the textbook response from the outset.

11:31.325 --> 11:35.892
The point was that the psychology, the fear, the 
confusion, that ensued. In some cases, lack of

11:38.875 --> 11:47.791
equipment, particularly in the very early times,

11:38.875 --> 11:47.791
begets serious problems. Officers, for example, 
officers are instructed not to speak to anyone in a

11:48.653 --> 11:52.640
crowd. That sometimes, the temptation becomes 
overwhelming, someone's yelling profanities in

11:54.584 --> 12:00.394
your face to give them a word back and uh it takes a 
couple times to to learn i suppose that that's not

12:00.745 --> 12:23.327
going to get you anywhere it's not going to give you 
be a source of any self-satisfaction to you and

12:00.745 --> 12:23.327
when those lessons are learned you do tend to 
become better at crowd control you've already i

12:00.745 --> 12:23.327
know you've already touched on it but what was the 
the core psychology of the police how did they feel

12:23.594 --> 12:27.339
towards each other, how they feel as a group when 
they went into a situation. Well, one of the

12:27.359 --> 12:42.822
interesting points that I would make is that the 
police are placed in a role, not only in terms of

12:27.359 --> 12:42.822
crowd control, riot, civil disturbances, but in 
terms of their daily operating environment, are

12:27.359 --> 12:42.822
placed in a role of maintaining the status quo. And 
as such, it doesn't matter how you feel about the

12:43.643 --> 12:48.310
particular cause. It doesn't matter how you feel 
about the social situation in a black ghetto. Your

12:54.087 --> 13:00.539
role is maintenance of order, and that's the 
mandate that you're given. You hold up your right

13:00.579 --> 13:09.717
hand and swear that you're going to uphold the 
Constitution of the United States, a particular

13:00.579 --> 13:09.717
state, and the statutory law that pertains 
thereto. One can be very sympathetic to the

13:10.338 --> 13:13.686
demonstrators. One can be very sympathetic to the 
rioters. But you're going to enforce the law. And

13:18.918 --> 13:26.676
as such, one is caught in a position of, the 
academic term would be some cognitive

13:18.918 --> 13:26.676
dissonance. Although you personally may have 
been sympathetic to the protest against the

13:26.656 --> 13:38.154
Vietnam War, you personally may have felt that we 
should get out of Vietnam. Nevertheless, your job

13:38.174 --> 13:44.344
was to make sure that a demonstration with regard 
to that issue did not get out of hand. That puts you

13:45.385 --> 13:48.009
in an inevitable conflict position. Now what 
happens as a civil disturbance situation, gains

13:54.382 --> 14:13.453
momentum as it progresses and the minutes go into 
hours and hours into days,

13:54.382 --> 14:13.453
there are sufficient transgressions by the other 
side, physical transgressions, assaults,

13:54.382 --> 14:13.453
profanities, rocks hurled at you, efforts to, you 
know, efforts to injure you and your colleagues.

14:20.306 --> 14:21.807
And you don't know them as uniforms. You know them 
as people who have children after raising and

14:21.847 --> 14:24.951
everything else. And you stand and I stand and look 
to my side and I see a good friend, Jim Harkin, who

14:25.011 --> 14:41.829
had three children, all under five, take a brick on 
the helmet and even with that helmet, knock him

14:25.011 --> 14:41.829
unconscious and suffered a serious concussion 
hauling him away from the ambulance. It doesn't

14:41.849 --> 14:43.170
take you very long to get angry. You may be 
sympathetic to the general cause, but you get

14:43.792 --> 14:47.078
angry at the people over there. Because you are 
treated in a law enforcement role as if you're a

14:48.541 --> 14:57.800
non-human entity, as if you're a machine inside a 
uniform. And that's resented. You resent that.

15:01.888 --> 15:05.074
And so you find officers who... who are 
sympathetic to the cause, nevertheless striking

15:05.678 --> 15:08.201
out. The problem of controlling the police, of 
keeping the nightsticks down, gets to be a very

15:08.861 --> 15:16.929
serious problem. I'll give you a case in point

15:17.210 --> 15:23.536
from more recent past. We had, in the past year, a 
march in Austin by the Ku Klux Klan. Get it out yet?

15:30.663 --> 15:32.445
The Ku Klux Klan. We had several groups in Austin, 
as well as the general public, objecting strongly

15:32.982 --> 15:41.972
to that and were determined to harass the Klan on 
their march. The Klan had a right to march, a right

15:41.992 --> 15:44.495
to assemble. And the police have to protect the 
right of the Ku Klux Klan to assemble, whether they

15:45.156 --> 15:50.803
agree with them or not. There was constant 
harassment of the Klan as they marched down the

15:52.705 --> 15:58.872
route in Austin. And sometimes that gets very 
unpleasant. Bags of feces were tossed, for

16:01.615 --> 16:04.600
example. And some of it hits a Klan, and 
occasionally police officers walking beside a

16:04.740 --> 16:09.226
Klansman gets hit. And the police officers 
reacted in a very predictable way. They became

16:12.731 --> 16:17.418
angry at the people who were attempting to stop the 
Klan from marching. Now, I assure you that the

16:17.899 --> 16:26.952
Austin Police Department, the caliber of 
officers on that Austin Police Department, are

16:17.899 --> 16:26.952
not sympathetic towards the KKK or their cause. 
and are far more sympathetic, are very

16:27.202 --> 16:38.734
sympathetic to the ideological position of the 
crowd that's attempting to stop the march. But

16:39.134 --> 16:51.087
they were cast into that role, an adversarial 
role, with the crowd, and a supportive role, in

16:39.134 --> 16:51.087
essence, with the KKK, since they were charged 
with protecting the KKK. And as you know, towards

16:51.747 --> 16:57.073
the end of the march, while there was an incident in 
which police lines, it was an effort to break

16:57.830 --> 17:00.758
police lines. And officers attempting to effect 
an arrest of one individual started flailing some

17:01.501 --> 17:12.733
nightsticks, probably took It looked bad on 
national television. It looked like they were

17:15.108 --> 17:17.433
just wailing the devil out of the people. In 
effect, if you take that, and I watched a

17:17.453 --> 17:31.144
slow-motion version of that that Frank Dyson had, 
showed the chief's administrative conference

17:17.453 --> 17:31.144
here a few months ago, and actually you're dealing 
with maybe three or four swings with a nightstick

17:31.951 --> 17:35.754
that were not necessary. I won't say probably not 
necessary. Were not necessary to affect the

17:36.695 --> 17:38.237
arrest. But the officers were involved in a 
one-on-one as a mob surrounding them, probably

17:39.177 --> 17:45.363
20, 30 people. You're dealing with three or four 
officers. And again, the assumption is those

17:47.525 --> 17:55.552
officers are actually confident of their own 
safety, have no fear at all, and in fact, are scared

17:47.525 --> 17:55.552
to death that somebody's going to grab a gun or grab 
the nightstick and wail on them or whatever.

17:59.595 --> 18:00.456
The police. will inevitably come into conflict 
with a crowd that is attempting to make

18:00.757 --> 18:16.776
a political statement through civil 
disobedience. No question about that. This leads

18:19.920 --> 18:22.783
right into, how do you define a police riot? What 
are the signs you can see that bring that down?

18:27.729 --> 18:29.211
Well, we've probably only had One incident, a 
police riot in the United States since the Second

18:30.423 --> 18:41.678
World War, and I don't know, I'm not familiar 
enough with history prior to that to know for sure.

18:41.698 --> 18:47.105
And that was in 1968 at the Democratic National 
Convention in Chicago. A police riot occurs

18:48.207 --> 18:53.814
whenever individual officers cannot be 
controlled by their supervisors. And that's what

18:53.914 --> 18:56.818
happened in Chicago. It became supervisory 
orders were, in effect, ignored on the street in

18:57.187 --> 19:03.497
Chicago. And individual officers were effecting 
street justice, clubbing demonstrators, and so

19:04.218 --> 19:13.452
forth. That's a fascinating incident, by the way, 
in terms of the full history of that. And again, the

19:18.680 --> 19:22.266
police psychology surrounding that incident. 
Few people are aware of the fact that deliberate

19:24.220 --> 19:33.910
efforts were made by some of the extremist groups. 
And I hasten to add that the demonstrators in

19:34.210 --> 19:53.670
Chicago consisted of a real mix of people, which is 
part of the problem, from extremist groups who

19:34.210 --> 19:53.670
were determined to force violence, feeling that 
was a part of a strategy to effect political

19:34.210 --> 19:53.670
change, to curious onlookers.

19:55.979 --> 19:58.923
Efforts were made to obtain home addresses of 
police officers. Threats were made that while the

19:59.824 --> 20:11.298
officers were controlling the demonstrations, 
the extremist groups would, quote, get their

19:59.824 --> 20:11.298
families. Families, generally the police banded 
together, although it was not an official city

20:12.820 --> 20:22.712
policy, the police banded together, and during 
those Tuesday, Wednesday nights, whenever

20:23.131 --> 20:28.092
things were at their worst, had moved their 
families out of their homes. Now one of the things

20:29.097 --> 20:32.652
that, the lesson there is when the police quit 
cease to be bureaucrats, when the police are

20:32.902 --> 20:42.376
personally threatened, are no longer simply 
performing a bureaucratic role, but feel a

20:32.902 --> 20:42.376
personal threat, they're going to be very 
difficult to control. And they're not going to

20:43.218 --> 20:45.681
play by the rules anymore. And if somebody starts 
threatening your family, what you see is, even if

20:46.162 --> 20:54.775
the threat is not specific, even if your 
telephone's never rung at home, Even if you have no

20:55.025 --> 21:04.376
direct evidence that that's going to occur, if 
there's talk of doing that, then police officers

20:55.025 --> 21:04.376
will react accordingly. Will simply strike out 
against what they see as a symbolic assailants,

21:04.556 --> 21:12.826
which are the demonstrators on the street. And 
that's what happened in Chicago.

21:16.891 --> 21:21.056
When and to what extent did training on crowd 
psychology occur in the 60s? When was it stepped

21:21.076 --> 21:24.019
up? recognized, first of all, that police 
training was done only sporadically

21:24.505 --> 21:35.943
before 1968, 69. As a point in fact, it was probably 
some of the problems of civil disturbances which

21:36.744 --> 21:49.163
beget

21:36.744 --> 21:49.163
political action that mandates police training. 
in virtually every state, police officers are

21:49.582 --> 21:56.228
required by law to complete a certain minimum 
number of hours of basic training. In addition to

21:56.288 --> 21:59.411
that, there's available advanced in-service 
training. Those laws were passed by and large in

22:01.293 --> 22:15.627
1969 through 1972 and were not entirely a product 
of the difficulties the police experienced in

22:01.293 --> 22:15.627
controlling civil disturbances, but that 
certainly was a contribution. The fact that that

22:16.902 --> 22:40.243
inadequate or inappropriate police action, 
often aggravated situations that aggravated

22:16.902 --> 22:40.243
civil disturbances rather than assisted in 
quelling them, was part of the impetus to get

22:16.902 --> 22:40.243
mandatory basic training laws for our police 
passed, part of the impetus for trying to recruit

22:16.902 --> 22:40.243
college-educated individuals in the police 
service, which is now very widespread. So the

22:40.713 --> 22:53.965
training which was received, and I'm giving you a 
long-winded answer to your question, but it's

22:40.713 --> 22:53.965
important to recognize that the largest agencies 
generally had basic training and had had since the

22:40.713 --> 22:53.965
1950s, at least basic training. Relatively 
little, if any, in-service training was done. So

22:57.669 --> 23:05.556
the police approached that whole era, 1965 
through 1970, essentially untrained in crowd

22:57.669 --> 23:05.556
control. Individual officers, at least, had not 
had specific training. Now, once disturbances

23:10.582 --> 23:25.037
started, why training programs were geared up 
very quickly and agencies would offer one-day

23:10.582 --> 23:25.037
seminars or would offer roll call training to 
officers in terms of behavior during crowd

23:10.582 --> 23:25.037
control situations and so forth. Do you think this 
was an important change? Did it really help? No.

23:33.626 --> 23:37.450
Primarily, what one must deal with in terms of 
police The reason I say that is the tactics for

23:38.307 --> 23:47.898
crowd control were known despite the training, 
and the supervisory personnel were apprised and

23:38.307 --> 23:47.898
were aware of what tactics should be employed. The 
difficulty was in dealing with the psychology of

23:49.580 --> 23:58.570
the officers, not in the officers not knowing what 
a wedge was or what the proper way to hold a

23:49.580 --> 23:58.570
nightstick was. It was in the officers' 
psychological approach to aggressive crowds,

23:59.371 --> 24:08.061
and that was really the primary source of the 
difficulty. Okay. Which crowds were the easiest

24:10.384 --> 24:15.590
to handle and which type of crowds were the worst to 
handle? The different, you know, the race and the

24:15.610 --> 24:19.514
war crowd, war demonstrators? Well, the war 
demonstrators were probably easier to handle

24:19.534 --> 24:28.384
than the race riot situations, unquestionably 
were easier to handle than the race riot

24:19.534 --> 24:28.384
situations. One of the things that goes 
unrecognized, and I, to the best of my knowledge,

24:34.670 --> 24:42.600
Not one individual was killed by a police officer, 
a civilian police officer in this country, during

24:34.670 --> 24:42.600
the course of the war demonstrations. And we 
often, we talk about police riots and police being

24:43.000 --> 24:49.007
out of control during that era and how terrible it 
was. That's a bunch of bunk. We did not have scores

24:51.671 --> 24:55.395
of people laying dead on the streets. Compare that 
to some of the experiences that have occurred in

24:55.375 --> 25:04.364
Europe, some of the experiences which have 
occurred in Japan, for example, and they've had

24:55.375 --> 25:04.364
much worse experience. So despite the lack of 
preparedness on the part of the American police,

25:04.384 --> 25:21.822
despite the lack of equipment, despite the fear 
that was engendered, the amount of alienation

25:04.384 --> 25:21.822
that at that time existed between the police and 
extremist war demonstrators, People were not

25:22.021 --> 25:26.707
dying in the streets of the United States in 1967 to 
1972.

25:29.290 --> 25:34.797
The one incident where we had, of course, death 
occur was at Kent State with the Ohio National

25:29.290 --> 25:34.797
Guard. And I'll reiterate a point I made earlier. 
You were dealing with a group of people, National

25:38.682 --> 25:47.674
Guard, inexperienced and scared to death. And you 
had, in essence, what we talk about, the agents of

25:48.346 --> 25:57.620
the state, the military firing upon helpless 
civilians. In effect, what you had was a bunch of

25:58.562 --> 26:01.847
18-year-olds shooting at a bunch of other 
18-year-olds. And there's a world of difference

26:02.468 --> 26:15.568
in terms of one's perception and view of that 
incident, depending upon what words are used, the

26:02.468 --> 26:15.568
semantics that are used to describe the incident. 
I don't excuse the actions of that unit of the Ohio

26:17.067 --> 26:30.863
National Guard, but I certainly understand the 
actions in terms of the fear that they

26:17.067 --> 26:30.863
experienced. And again, if you look at the 
videotapes of the situation, you say, oh my God,

26:30.903 --> 26:37.531
here they are armed with rifles, and you've got a 
bunch of college students. How could they

26:37.571 --> 26:38.973
possibly feel threatened? But they do feel 
threatened. And unquestionably, what happens is

26:40.642 --> 26:53.583
a form of crowd psychology or mob psychology 
occurred within the rank of the National Guard

26:40.642 --> 26:53.583
whenever the first shot went off. And as of yet, I 
don't believe it was ever established who fired

26:53.623 --> 26:58.431
the first shot or why. For all we know, it could have 
been an accidental discharge of a gun, but once

26:58.799 --> 27:12.392
that first shot was fired, then a kind of crowd 
psychology overcame the guard, and of course a

26:58.799 --> 27:12.392
volley of shots were then fired. But it's very 
important to note, first of all, even four people

27:14.354 --> 27:24.604
dying during that era with the amount of potential 
violence that could have occurred, the number of

27:25.141 --> 27:41.649
bombings that were occurred, the number of 
ambushes that occurred against police officers

27:25.141 --> 27:41.649
where they were killed in ambush, and the fact that 
only four people in the country died in

27:25.141 --> 27:41.649
demonstrations is an outstanding record, and 
it's even more interesting to note that no one died

27:25.141 --> 27:41.649
at the hands of civilian police. That's good. I 
know when Martin Luther King was assassinated,

27:44.354 --> 27:47.419
several riots broke out. What kind of impact do you 
think riots in other parts of the country have on

27:47.838 --> 27:52.504
potential riot situations? Oh, without any 
question, it's a chain reaction event.

27:58.653 --> 28:14.014
We would, in Lansing, which is 90 miles from 
Detroit, we would monitor the situation in

27:58.653 --> 28:14.014
Detroit on an hour-by-hour basis during those hot 
summer months in those years because we knew that

27:58.653 --> 28:14.014
the minute disturbance broke out in Detroit, it 
was very likely that we would have disturbances

28:14.652 --> 28:22.464
occurring in Lansing. Yes, there is very much a 
chain reaction that occurs in those kind of

28:23.466 --> 28:28.674
instances.

28:32.019 --> 28:38.449
The ghetto riots have a wholly different 
character to them. In the first place, one tends

28:39.610 --> 28:47.147
not to deal with aggregated mobs, with mobs 
collected, a lot of people in one place. Rather,

28:47.348 --> 28:53.181
you deal with small groups of young males. I don't 
recall ever seeing a group larger than 10, for

28:53.363 --> 29:03.984
example, in my experiences in trying to control 
disturbances in the Black Ghetto in Lansing. And

29:04.966 --> 29:11.338
that was true in Detroit as well, maybe somewhat 
larger. The groups never operated as unified

29:11.318 --> 29:16.766
mobs. Rather, you'd get looting that would break 
out on a particular street, and it'd be a dozen

29:17.647 --> 29:28.684
people in one store and a dozen people in another 
store and so forth, rather than really a concerted

29:17.647 --> 29:28.684
movement.

29:32.350 --> 29:38.659
Even in those situations, though, there was... 
there was a certain understanding which existed

29:39.382 --> 29:46.936
about the level of force that was going to be used. 
Undoubtedly, in certain cities in the Watts

29:49.160 --> 29:55.652
section of Los Angeles, in Detroit, in Newark, New 
Jersey, The rioting degenerated, the reaction of

29:57.353 --> 30:06.226
the police degenerated such that there were 
instances of shooting to kill. People died in all

30:06.466 --> 30:08.349
those cities. In the majority of disturbances in 
the country, though, no one shot to kill. We

30:16.521 --> 30:18.984
responded, I recall responding on a couple of 
instances. A typical tactic on the part of black

30:19.225 --> 30:24.913
activists at that time was to set an automobile on 
fire. It was parked on a street. Fire department

30:29.004 --> 30:29.945
would get called. Fire department would respond. 
During that era, the police naturally were called

30:31.267 --> 30:35.552
automatically to accompany the fire department. 
In fact, as a point in fact, in many cities, police

30:35.752 --> 30:39.717
go automatically anyway for traffic control. But 
in these instances, you would go in case there were

30:41.379 --> 30:43.842
problems. And firemen would bail onto the truck. 
You'd pull up in the patrol car and get out and look

30:48.568 --> 30:51.431
around. And you'd hear shots go off. Everybody 
dive for cover, take off. You get on the police

30:58.877 --> 31:03.183
radio and call for backup and crouch down behind a 
car. I never saw a bullet hole in a police car. I

31:05.947 --> 31:10.875
never had a bullet crack on the pavement next to me. 
They were shooting in the air. It was a kind of

31:15.001 --> 31:24.195
situation where there was sort of a, at best I can 
call it a tacit understanding, that we weren't

31:25.171 --> 31:30.318
going to be killed as long as we didn't shoot to kill 
back. And that was generally done. Now, I don't

31:33.662 --> 31:36.586
want to get Pollyannish about this. People die. 
And I don't want to exaggerate this, but in the

31:37.948 --> 31:49.843
majority of instances, the vast majority of 
instances, 99% of the instances, people could

31:37.948 --> 31:49.843
have died but didn't because it was an 
understanding on both sides you weren't going to

31:37.948 --> 31:49.843
kill.

31:52.907 --> 31:52.967
OK. You've already said a few of them, but what 
factors can change a crowd's mood to violence

31:53.318 --> 31:57.682
quickly? Things the police can do, things their 
leader can do? Yeah, one is always cautious in

32:03.729 --> 32:08.273
terms of crowd control. It's term in the 
literature, trigger events. One of the tactics in

32:13.098 --> 32:22.988
terms of crowd control is if police make a judgment 
that a crowd is going to get out of hand, is to

32:23.930 --> 32:29.859
attempt to go in and arrest leaders, to make 
selective arrests. You always try to avoid mass

32:29.879 --> 32:31.681
arrests if you can. And that's done, the way that's 
done is to go in very quickly, grab somebody, drag

32:31.742 --> 32:44.601
them off, and pull back immediately again, not 
stay in immediate physical proximity of the

32:31.742 --> 32:44.601
crowd. That tactic is...

32:50.373 --> 33:01.969
is premised upon the notion that if you can remove 
sources of instigation, specific sources of

32:50.373 --> 33:01.969
instigation, you could probably keep a crowd 
under control. In relatively few instances is a

33:02.523 --> 33:08.491
crowd destined to riot, or destined to become 
aggressive. It usually takes either someone

33:08.611 --> 33:20.265
who's inciting the crowd, or an action on the 
police, or in some cases they get out of control

33:08.611 --> 33:20.265
over something that no one can control. Some event 
occurs that finally incites the crowd to riot.

33:31.447 --> 33:33.729
Police tactics include extreme restraint. I 
mentioned previously, you don't even speak to

33:33.989 --> 33:36.992
someone in a crowd. You try to keep a reasonable 
distance back so that the direct physical

33:37.032 --> 33:45.680
confrontation, physical contact does not occur. 
In the early stages of a crowd, you operate with

33:46.741 --> 33:58.973
minimum show of force at the point whenever 
whenever the line is being crossed and the crowd is

33:59.240 --> 34:08.272
being triggered into aggressive action, then you 
show up with massive force, intimidating force is

33:59.240 --> 34:08.272
the general tactic. So in general what you do is 
have a small contingent, as few as three or four

34:08.753 --> 34:17.144
officers, who might be standing in the vicinity of 
the crowd, monitoring the crowd. If something

34:18.606 --> 34:23.492
triggers the crowd or if it appears as though it's 
inevitable that they're going to become

34:18.606 --> 34:23.492
aggressive, Then you have waiting a block away in a 
bus or in some other kind of public building or

34:23.928 --> 34:32.138
whatever, a large contingent of officers to move 
in very quickly. And whenever you move in, you try

34:32.198 --> 34:35.923
to, there are certain rules of the road. You give 
the crowd a route to escape. It's like you don't

34:38.466 --> 34:42.931
trap a rattlesnake in the corner unless you want 
him to strike at you. You don't trap a crow in the

34:42.951 --> 34:45.835
corner unless you want them to strike. So you give 
them a chance to escape. You try to subdivide the

34:47.829 --> 34:49.571
crowd. You try to get into smaller and smaller 
groups as you disperse them to break that up, to

34:49.611 --> 34:59.765
sort of diffuse the mob psychology that occurs. 
How did the demonstrators feel towards the police

35:01.688 --> 35:06.634
before the police had done anything? And has that 
changed over the 60s, during the decade?

35:15.194 --> 35:19.240
As more riots went on, as the police came, there was 
sudden hostility?

35:23.107 --> 35:36.628
No, I would not say that there was extreme 
hostility at the outset of a demonstration, even

35:23.107 --> 35:36.628
over a period of time, even after there had been 
several demonstrations.

35:37.047 --> 35:42.855
dealing with two really very different kinds of 
incidents, so we'll have to talk about each of them

35:37.047 --> 35:42.855
separately. In the Vietnam protests, the Vietnam 
War demonstrations, the crowd largely regarded

35:42.875 --> 35:55.153
the police as part of the bigger game that was being 
played. It was all a matter of gamesmanship.

36:04.098 --> 36:18.600
As long as things were done within certain 
parameters, as long as somebody wasn't dragged

36:04.098 --> 36:18.600
off and being beaten, relatively speaking, peace 
would prevail at those demonstrations. Now, if a

36:18.680 --> 36:31.860
brick is thrown, and a police officer gets hurt, 
and a police retaliate by clubbing someone, then

36:18.680 --> 36:31.860
the level of violence tends to get on an escalating 
spiral. But I don't think the crowds in the Vietnam

36:32.397 --> 36:39.507
War protests approached the police intending to 
harm the police. I don't think they approached the

36:39.567 --> 36:44.034
police with extreme hostility. If anything, I 
suppose they regarded the police as sort of, and

36:45.917 --> 36:56.532
even among those who were totally taken up with the 
rhetoric at the time, as... as dupes or lackeys of

36:57.389 --> 37:04.898
the ruling elite who really were not evil in their 
own right, but were just misled. And so did not

37:05.879 --> 37:12.407
demonstrate any kind of hatred for the police. It 
was interesting. I'll describe one incident to

37:14.470 --> 37:16.052
you.

37:19.576 --> 37:21.979
During one of the demonstrations out at Michigan 
State University, There existed at Michigan

37:22.769 --> 37:33.600
State a commercial strip, a campus strip, like is 
common in so many campuses, bookstores and

37:22.769 --> 37:33.600
t-shirt shops and the like, restaurants. And that 
evening, the city council in East Lansing,

37:35.281 --> 37:51.477
similar to College Station Bryan situation, the 
city council in East Lansing had considered a

37:35.281 --> 37:51.477
resolution opposing the Vietnam War. And I don't 
know what even action was taken. But a large crowd

37:55.193 --> 37:56.796
had shown up with that. Things got out of hand, got 
unruly. A bunch of the college kids started

37:59.661 --> 38:06.191
rocking a fire chief's car, red fire car that was 
there. And before they finished rocking it, they

38:06.251 --> 38:09.036
had turned it on its top. And at that point, why, the 
whole area of police agencies were mobilized. Of

38:13.984 --> 38:16.588
course, we had inter-jurisdictional compacts to 
assist one another. Still do, of course, in those

38:16.928 --> 38:19.152
situations. And the mob made the round down the 
front of that college strip and through bricks,

38:20.954 --> 38:32.167
stones, whatever, through the glass windows. And 
so all the windows were broken out down this strip.

38:34.610 --> 38:36.632
Now, interestingly, no looting occurred. No one 
reached in and took so much as a t-shirt. But they

38:39.195 --> 38:44.802
broke out the windows as an expression of protest, 
an expression of rage, I suppose. We ended up

38:45.895 --> 38:53.385
showing up in the scene and crossed a large, 
divided avenue with a little boulevard, a grass

38:45.895 --> 38:53.385
boulevard in the middle. On one side were all the 
college students. That was the campus side. We

38:56.389 --> 39:00.795
lined up in front of these stores, hypothetically 
protect the stores, just keep watching the

38:56.389 --> 39:00.795
situation. Well, the hours drug on, and this 
happened to be in February, middle of the

39:00.835 --> 39:05.241
wintertime. It was cold in Lansing, Michigan in 
February. That night, the temperature was

39:07.444 --> 39:09.827
somewhere around zero. And that probably kept the 
size of the crowd down and kept the mood cool. In any

39:17.149 --> 39:23.563
case, someone over the net size I thought was a 
brilliant move, dreamed up a tactic. They baited

39:23.783 --> 39:29.436
us over across the street, and I can't recall now 
how they did it. whether they, as I recall, they

39:30.142 --> 39:37.750
drug a box of bricks and dumped them in a pile or 
something like that. And so we were committed to

39:37.810 --> 39:43.035
removing any projectiles away. And so a group of 
officers, probably 20, 30 officers, moved across

39:43.095 --> 39:55.247
the street in typical wedge formation to retrieve 
the bricks, to remove them so they wouldn't be

39:43.095 --> 39:55.247
thrown at the police. Well, that movement brought 
them and immediately underneath the student

40:00.618 --> 40:29.494
union building and the students were prepared up 
there they had drugged the fire hoses out at the

40:00.618 --> 40:29.494
situation where you have fire hoses right in the 
hallway they drug the fire hoses out when the

40:00.618 --> 40:29.494
police got underneath the windows the student 
union building they threw open the windows turned

40:00.618 --> 40:29.494
on the valves and just sprayed 30-40 officers down 
well at zero degrees you don't stay out there in

40:00.618 --> 40:29.494
soaking wet clothes so we had to take those all had 
to be retired but there were Students just broke

40:30.115 --> 40:31.777
out laughing. And to be honest with you, over in the 
police side, we broke out laughing as well. There

40:36.862 --> 40:41.888
were incidences where it was almost a, that's part 
of the gamesmanship involved. You weren't really

40:41.908 --> 40:43.890
going to hurt each other. Although

40:43.930 --> 40:49.176
a flying brick is certainly going to do some 
damage. But I don't think even those who threw the

40:49.196 --> 40:58.145
brick intended that they would kill a police 
officer by throwing that brick, or permanently

40:49.196 --> 40:58.145
maim a police officer by throwing that brick. OK. 
Moving on to politics, LBJ was quoted in 1964

41:00.170 --> 41:07.560
saying this is a tough time to be a police officer. 
Do you agree with this statement and why? It

41:09.603 --> 41:11.466
definitely was a tough time to be a police officer. 
I fully agree with Lyndon Johnson's statement in

41:11.486 --> 41:15.812
that regard. The primary reason was not any 
immediate physical threat of policing the

41:16.473 --> 41:30.092
demonstrations or policing the ghetto riots, 
although that certainly was germane. problem was

41:30.747 --> 41:37.295
the

41:30.747 --> 41:37.295
amount of public hostility against you. I was just 
a recent graduate of Michigan State and had gone on

41:39.557 --> 41:44.883
the police department. And one would go out there 
to demonstrations and be called every

41:46.105 --> 41:51.471
conceivable name one could imagine. And this is 
going to sound almost humorous, but it hurts your

41:52.712 --> 41:59.320
feelings.

42:00.987 --> 42:09.339
It's nice to say that one is insulated against 
that, that you separate the bureaucratic role

42:00.987 --> 42:09.339
from the personal role and all that, but you don't. 
We all get caught up in our occupational roles and

42:09.439 --> 42:15.307
identify with that occupational role. The amount 
of hostility, the amount of alienation, the

42:17.510 --> 42:24.960
outright hatred of the police in the black ghetto 
was very difficult to cope with. One would show up

42:25.061 --> 42:26.843
and you were Whether you wanted to be or not, you 
were perceived as the Gestapo, as an agent of a

42:28.392 --> 42:37.462
repressive and unjust state. And no one likes to be 
in that role. There wasn't anything I could

42:40.726 --> 42:54.501
personally do about the plight of blacks in the 
United States, then or now, in the sense of massive

42:40.726 --> 42:54.501
reform or leading massive reform. Yet one was 
cast, and had then, and of course still have, a

42:55.628 --> 43:03.257
great deal of sympathy towards that situation.

43:05.880 --> 43:14.471
But yet you're cast, and you pull up on a scene, and 
you're greeted with, well, it's the man. It's the

43:14.631 --> 43:15.251
man. Everybody shut up. It's the man.

43:19.597 --> 43:21.699
Who are you going to whip up on this time? Those kind 
of comments. And threats from crowds in those

43:26.054 --> 43:31.001
situations and so forth. Of course, every call you 
responded to during that era, particularly

43:31.021 --> 43:37.691
during much of July and August up north, we were 
tense on. Because if a crowd started to gather at

43:37.791 --> 43:44.301
all, you were very afraid it was going to turn into a 
civil disturbance very quickly, and frequently

43:37.791 --> 43:44.301
did. And it was hard to maintain psychological 
balance in terms of, I'm doing the right thing. I'm

43:52.513 --> 43:55.858
performing a needed role. This is an honorable 
profession. The college kids are screaming at you

43:58.942 --> 44:14.304
one time that you're supporting murder in 
Southeast Asia, and the black residents are

43:58.942 --> 44:14.304
screaming at you the next day that you're 
perpetuating

43:58.942 --> 44:14.304
poverty and exploitation.

44:16.807 --> 44:19.611
That was the primary difficulty in being a 
policeman during that era. What impact, if any,

44:20.833 --> 44:25.980
did Johnson's administration have on crowd 
control during the 60s? have any legislation that

44:26.872 --> 44:35.421
would help support the placement on what you're 
just talking about?

44:35.441 --> 44:41.627
To be honest with you, I don't recall any national 
legislation that was passed that was directly

44:35.441 --> 44:41.627
pertinent to crowd control. Every

44:41.688 --> 44:51.157
state, well, first of all, we're fine. We teach 
criminal law classes over here. One of the things

44:52.899 --> 44:56.423
that our faculty do is When we refer to any state, we 
refer to it as the sovereign state of. So if we talk

45:00.007 --> 45:03.271
about the state of Texas, we talk about the 
sovereign state of Texas. And one of the reasons we

45:04.353 --> 45:12.524
do that is to impress upon students the fact that in 
terms of criminal statutes, we deal with 50

45:04.353 --> 45:12.524
different systems in this country. Federal law 
has limited applicability towards criminal law

45:13.085 --> 45:16.530
enforcement. As such, laws that were applicable 
towards crowd control were state statutes, and

45:21.648 --> 45:27.758
all states have general statutes against 
rioting, insurrection, and so forth. I just

45:28.579 --> 45:34.148
simply don't recall any federal legislation that 
had any impact out on the street level. Do you

45:35.511 --> 45:46.288
remember any state changes while you were in the 
force that you saw, whether it was psychological

45:35.511 --> 45:46.288
or equipment?

45:46.960 --> 45:51.507
The primary change, I don't recall any statutory 
changes that had any particular effect. There

45:53.771 --> 45:57.657
were statutes passed generally at that time. The 
only one I can remember are statutes passed about

45:57.837 --> 46:12.900
carrying gasoline away from gas stations and 
containers, which statutes were passed which

45:57.837 --> 46:12.900
forbid you from doing that during that particular 
time. No, certainly equipment changes made some

46:14.129 --> 46:17.953
difference. Problems that we faced initially, 
and to some extent the police still face it, we're

46:19.294 --> 46:26.262
not well equipped yet at all to deal with this. 
Problem fades and interest in it fades and other

46:26.702 --> 46:31.528
items take budgetary preference. 
Unfortunately, the police in dealing with crowds

46:32.308 --> 46:40.457
all too frequently find themselves either having 
to use a stick or at the other extreme, deadly

46:41.602 --> 46:46.329
force, with nothing in between available to them. 
So the first time we went out to the

46:46.349 --> 47:05.656
campus demonstrations at Michigan State 
University, it rolled up in a paddy wagon and it was

46:46.349 --> 47:05.656
stacked with shotguns with 12-oct buck in them. 
Now that's absurd. You're not going to use it. You

47:08.099 --> 47:10.022
don't want to use that. They weren't even 
distributed, by the way. But even in terms of what

47:15.312 --> 47:26.729
you've got in your holster, really in that kind of 
situation, you'd rather not have

47:15.312 --> 47:26.729
in your revolver regular ammunition. You'd be 
better off with something that was less deadly.

47:31.877 --> 47:36.904
Later, by the way, the department did purchase 
burgeoning.
