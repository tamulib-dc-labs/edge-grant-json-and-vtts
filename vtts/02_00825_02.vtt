Could you tell us some things you may remember from 
the Depression?

00:08.623 --> 00:24.277
Well, honey, of course,

00:08.623 --> 00:24.277
it was keener then than it would be now because 
they'd have so much more help now than they did

00:08.623 --> 00:24.277
then. But during the Depression, Brown was not 
such a big city. And she didn't have all of these

00:30.997 --> 00:39.106
schools, these wonderful, wonderful 
educational schools that we have. I don't know how

00:39.126 --> 00:54.442
many we have, but we have a great many because when I 
came up, there was only one school and one for the

00:39.126 --> 00:54.442
Negroes, the blacks, as I'd call them. But nobody 
really and truly suffered, but they... They were

01:01.844 --> 01:21.581
deprived of many of their

01:01.844 --> 01:21.581
comforts and pleasures for a long time after that, 
because it takes a long time to accumulate what

01:01.844 --> 01:21.581
goes with those floods.

01:25.705 --> 01:30.349
Do you remember anything about the World War I or 
World War II? Well, no, except that just like any

01:32.354 --> 01:40.746
other town, we had to give up some of our finest 
boys.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.754
And everybody was patriotic, too. As

01:45.834 --> 01:58.412
long as you could be patriotic,

01:45.834 --> 01:58.412
boys were called and they went. I'd just like to go 
back a few steps now. You were telling me about your

02:05.253 --> 02:13.582
sister who married a man from here, your father's 
sister? Uh-huh. Do you know how they came to settle

02:15.705 --> 02:18.928
in this area? No, I don't. You don't? Where was your 
family from before they came here? Arkansas. My

02:28.531 --> 02:36.202
father was born and raised in Arkansas, and my 
mother was raised, born in Nashville, Tennessee.

02:37.424 --> 02:40.328
So your grandparents came to America? Yes. From 
where? My great-grandfather. Oh. Yes. Where did

02:50.542 --> 02:51.404
he come from? Huh? Where did he come from? Came from 
Ireland, I think. But I'm not positive about that.

02:58.986 --> 03:07.417
This book here, I think, will tell it because I've 
got the, you want to put that in there, don't you?

03:10.281 --> 03:16.069
I have the tree right here and pictures of the, 
there's the tree right here.

03:19.193 --> 03:21.216
One landed in Pennsylvania, you see. That's the 
one I went on the DAR on.

03:29.230 --> 03:30.593
See, it starts from here.

03:44.442 --> 03:49.112
This, I don't know where the original...

03:54.138 --> 03:55.360
what brought P.R. Smith out here. But as a young 
man, he wanted to come. And his wife came with him,

04:00.166 --> 04:04.691
which her name was Nancy, Nanny. And they called 
her Nancy. And she died here. And her little

04:10.859 --> 04:19.651
four-year-old son did also. And they're buried 
here in the Brown City Cemetery. About how big was

04:24.445 --> 04:27.770
Bryan as far back as you can remember? What is it? 
About how big was Bryan? Oh, it was not big at all,

04:30.995 --> 04:33.439
honey. You could walk anywhere you wanted to walk 
around town. There was very little going this way

04:39.127 --> 04:47.119
at all, man, this way. They seemed to be going more 
this way. More north? But that was just a few that

04:52.643 --> 04:56.148
went that way. But Brian built,

04:57.230 --> 05:05.662
I thought, pretty fast. We thought we were just as 
rich as pieces when the iron gin came in. And that

05:15.597 --> 05:17.961
was before my marriage. The what? That was before 
my marriage. What kind of gin? In 1900 and more.

05:29.599 --> 05:29.699
Oh. Okay. They had a big barbecue, big barbecue 
over by the Kemp High School. That's the black...

06:00.970 --> 06:01.279
Thank you.
