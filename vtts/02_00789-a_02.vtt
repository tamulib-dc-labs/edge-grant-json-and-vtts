WEBVTT

00:01.212 --> 00:03.996
Was that at A&M or some other institution? Another 
institution. I turned it down because I wanted to

00:05.738 --> 00:08.823
be with Dr. Francis Moore. And then I had another 
job offered in 31 that I turned down. I went to that

00:15.112 --> 00:17.575
place and investigated. Where was that? 
Research, where the Agricultural Experiment

00:18.356 --> 00:24.625
Station had a subdivision.

00:27.509 --> 00:28.671
And I turned it down. But Dr. Francis was perturbed 
and went over to the president's office trying to

00:30.338 --> 00:37.430
get a raise. And I wrote him a note. I said, I'm not 
asking for a raise for this. I'm just telling you

00:42.278 --> 00:45.844
that I'm satisfied here, and I'm going to stay. But 
he gave me a raise, and he didn't wharten.

00:54.699 --> 00:56.802
And it bothered him. Later on he found out that 
Wharton wasn't getting that raise. I don't know

01:00.882 --> 01:04.547
who called his attention to him, if it was Wharton 
or somebody else. But he said that we came here on

01:05.528 --> 01:10.253
the same basis and should be on the same basis. 
That's a Wharton seven? No, Dr. Francis. Oh, but

01:13.917 --> 01:16.020
I'm a little confused now. Wharton did not get a 
raise. No, he did not. And you did? Yes.

01:28.102 --> 01:37.112
But I don't know

01:28.102 --> 01:37.112
just exactly why that came about in 35. If I did, 
I've forgotten. Don't you think Dr. Francis had

01:39.755 --> 01:42.999
something to do with it? Well, he had to approve it. 
He was dean. And

01:49.086 --> 01:55.373
I don't know whether Dr. Marsteller had anything 
to do with it. I can't answer that. I don't know

01:57.160 --> 01:58.442
what... I know this, that I didn't know the...

02:07.773 --> 02:26.155
The ramifications on the responsibilities of 
head of a department, apparently, because Dean

02:07.773 --> 02:26.155
Bolton called me, asked me, told me that I was 
supposed to attend academic council meetings,

02:07.773 --> 02:26.155
but no one had ever told me about it. And I missed one 
or two before I started going.

02:39.404 --> 02:42.627
But that's a long time ago, I don't recall it. Oh, 
except this, that in 36, I had been going to summer

02:44.629 --> 02:56.800
school in,

02:44.629 --> 02:56.800
I think I went in 29. I spent a summer away from here 
at the University of Chicago taking special

02:57.202 --> 03:07.095
courses in physiology and biochemistry.

03:09.938 --> 03:18.730
And then in 34,

03:09.938 --> 03:18.730
I was employed by the city of Dallas on meat 
inspection for the summer.

03:21.714 --> 03:22.855
And one summer I helped Dr. Francis turned a course 
over to me to teach. He was supposed to teach it in

03:26.019 --> 03:27.521
the summer. I taught it in his place. That was in 
1933, I believe. I think it was in the Depression,

03:37.089 --> 03:39.852
either 1932 or 1933. In 1934 I worked for the city of 
Dallas.

03:53.176 --> 04:07.531
Dr.

03:53.176 --> 04:07.531
Francis died on June 28, 1936, and I was in Austin at 
the University of Texas taking two courses, one in

03:53.176 --> 04:07.531
physics and one in pharmacy.

04:11.074 --> 04:21.765
And

04:11.074 --> 04:21.765
Ed's department was supposed to be on a 
twelve-month basis, and I'd been out on a

04:23.028 --> 04:25.010
nine-month basis up until then. But I knew my 
yearly salary, and they paid to me in the nine

04:26.992 --> 04:32.538
months. I didn't apply for a leave of absence. I 
spoke to Dr. Francis. He said, sure, it would. And

04:42.289 --> 04:45.312
that was enough as far as he was concerned. And so at 
his funeral, Dr. Marsteller told me, he says, Do

04:53.048 --> 04:56.873
you know you're supposed to be on 12 months basis? I 
said, they paid me a nine, Dr. Marcell. He said,

05:01.220 --> 05:02.461
well, you're supposed to. Evidently, the fiscal 
office had called his attention to it, that I was

05:04.564 --> 05:11.674
supposed to be on 12 months. And no one told you 
that? No. It was an error on the fiscal department.

05:17.783 --> 05:20.667
They, of course, never made a mistake, but they did 
that one time. So they dropped it. They said, drop

05:23.423 --> 05:24.164
it. Forget about it. So after then, I applied for 
leave of absence. But in other words, they wanted

05:30.709 --> 05:42.560
you to stay the extra three months in the summer, 
but keep you at the same nine-month salary. Heads

05:42.580 --> 05:47.164
departments were supposed to be on 12 months duty. 
That's right. I don't recall my salary. I don't

05:51.187 --> 05:51.928
know whether I got a raise that year or not, I don't 
recall. Maybe I did. They paid me nine months, nine

05:58.132 --> 06:04.658
equal installments.

06:04.678 --> 06:05.979
Nothing more was said about it.

06:09.282 --> 06:12.564
I don't believe we could get by the fiscal 
department nowadays with that. Back in 1935 when

06:15.167 --> 06:21.392
you took over that department, do you recall what 
what your aims were, what you thought you should do

06:23.009 --> 06:27.715
with that department?

06:30.518 --> 06:32.120
I don't recall now if I did. Life went on about as 
usual, but

06:32.160 --> 06:47.818
I think I started probably with the idea of 
reorganizing courses.

06:53.047 --> 07:06.041
When 37, when Dr. Marsteller, or fall of 36, I don't 
know when he asked me then, or in 37, whether I

06:53.047 --> 07:06.041
wanted to change anything. I had

07:06.061 --> 07:11.888
several, I'll say, several changes. During what 
those changes were? Well, increasing the hours

07:17.514 --> 07:22.159
and changing the hours on some courses, yes. We 
went from a four hour laboratory in toxicology, as

07:23.287 --> 07:30.435
I recall. Back in those days you had two hour 
laboratories or four hour laboratories. I asked

07:36.321 --> 07:37.963
for a three hour laboratory. They wouldn't give it 
to me.

07:42.407 --> 07:45.350
Joe Howell was— Why did you want a three hour 
laboratory? Because four was too long and two was

07:45.370 --> 07:47.933
too short. I see. The material we had to teach in 
that particular course It was just a waste of time,

07:53.240 --> 08:03.570
to me, that fourth hour, because four hours is 
entirely too long for a laboratory period, the way

07:53.240 --> 08:03.570
we are teaching it. So Joe Howell says, no, he says, 
you'll run our block system on scheduling. And Joe

08:14.381 --> 08:17.224
Howell did all the scheduling. He was a wizard at 
constructing schedules. But I can see in one part

08:24.070 --> 08:28.276
in his favor that you had a two or four hour lab. And 
if you put a three hours, you lose. You waste that

08:32.683 --> 08:36.168
hour you can't schedule. So if you have a one, four 
hour lab per week, you've got one hour there that

08:36.969 --> 08:43.799
you can't block off another course. So I said, 
well, Joe, If I had previously talked with Dr.

08:51.273 --> 09:14.271
Eads, who came into the department in the fall of 
36, following his graduation in 36, in June 36, or

08:51.273 --> 09:14.271
May, I said, George Eads and I had discussed that if 
you wouldn't let us have it in the regular one to

08:51.273 --> 09:14.271
five, it would go to six o'clock. I said, well, Joe, 
would it, be all right if we went from three to six?"

09:21.266 --> 09:22.688
He says, yeah, if you want to do that. So we've had 
three hour labs ever since. And there are many

09:28.237 --> 09:31.541
three hour laboratories now. But I think that's 
true of other institutions. But that's one change

09:35.748 --> 09:42.778
I recall that it looked like we were going to have a 
lot of difficulty with. We didn't, and then we

09:43.872 --> 09:52.042
changed the hours on some courses and decreased it 
on some and increased it on others. I recall that.

09:54.786 --> 09:56.267
How about new faculty members? Well, we added Eads 
that fall. How many did you start out with in that

10:00.873 --> 10:05.098
department when you were chairman? One. That's 
you. That's right. When I came here in 26, there

10:07.862 --> 10:12.107
were four departments. and six staff members for 
the entire School of Veterinary Medicine.

10:21.221 --> 10:33.936
But EADS came in and then we added a third member I 
guess in 38 or 39, I don't recall, Herbert Ott. And

10:36.219 --> 10:39.242
then Ott went to the

10:41.872 --> 10:48.442
wanted to go into service, and he spent most of the 
war at Billy Bidd prison camp. But he's in

10:48.462 --> 10:51.146
practicing California now, fortunately. He got 
out of it. He had charge of all the

10:53.670 --> 11:06.750
buffalo and things like that for all the meat 
supply for that, in that prison camp.

11:09.074 --> 11:09.955
But,

11:14.660 --> 11:21.969
And then Henry Kozyski, he changed his name to 
Keane, I believe. He was Polish. And why he changed

11:27.116 --> 11:29.299
his name is beyond me. I don't think anyone ever 
knew why, unless it was his wife. He married a girl

11:33.905 --> 11:38.471
from Bremont, I believe, or Waco, somewhere up 
there. When did he come? He came in...

11:49.102 --> 11:55.730
probably 40, and stayed for a couple of years, and 
then he wanted to go in service. So he is your third

11:55.750 --> 11:58.253
department member. Yes. And then he went to China 
and spent, went in the service, and quite a bit of it

11:59.795 --> 12:05.743
was in China. Gee, yes. And he had quite an 
experience, too. He came back, and we tried to get

12:11.870 --> 12:17.077
him back, and he was a good man. He was from 
Michigan. But he decided he wanted to get into

12:19.460 --> 12:22.484
public health work. And so I think he went down to 
Panama. I forget what, some tropical area. But

12:33.317 --> 12:42.729
then, I don't know, it was

12:33.317 --> 12:42.729
gradually added here and there. How many faculty 
members did you have when you retired in your

12:43.029 --> 12:49.197
department? I'd say eight or ten, something like 
that. Eight or nine.

12:59.853 --> 13:04.480
So you went from one to eight or nine in thirty-one 
years. I'm not past the exact number, but oh

13:04.600 --> 13:14.053
goodness, you must have twenty or more now.

13:16.463 --> 13:21.230
So that's one of the changes that you witnessed, 
this great expansion in your department. Yes, and

13:21.330 --> 13:23.213
then the method of teaching. As students 
increased

13:23.433 --> 13:32.887
the classes, we had to modify the method of 
teaching. Okay, tell me about that. What

13:35.311 --> 13:41.180
specifically, in your book you talk about 
electronic equipment. Yes. What kind of

13:42.562 --> 13:44.665
electronic equipment? Dr. Reeds and I were both 
interested in

13:44.898 --> 14:05.960
presenting things or amplifying sounds of the 
heart and peristalsis and the gastrointestinal

13:44.898 --> 14:05.960
tract. So we wanted a very superior instrument to 
do that with. And someone had come out with a Mako,

14:15.104 --> 14:26.439
M-A-I-C-O, heartbeat pickup specifically for 
the heart and frequency and the sounds. And it

14:27.861 --> 14:31.666
turned out to be a, it was put out by sound. And we 
got, we were not responsible for picking that

14:31.747 --> 14:36.553
company solely. We got literature from,

14:36.613 --> 14:43.963
corresponding with other veterinary colleges, 
particular at Cornell about the type of

14:44.213 --> 14:48.159
instruments. And I had gone to a workshop a couple 
of weeks up in Ithaca at Cornell University, got

14:48.339 --> 15:07.747
some pointers there, and we had already gotten 
into some of this other work before we went up

14:48.339 --> 15:07.747
there. But we got into it more after going up there, 
I think of their schools, Cornell was one of the

15:14.791 --> 15:25.044
leaders, and Minnesota was another one, but they 
got into the electronic method.

15:30.932 --> 15:44.730
So we contacted Dutch Dillingham, who was a 
professor in electrical engineering, a graduate

15:30.932 --> 15:44.730
here of 1922, and a friend of mine.

15:48.575 --> 15:55.824
Dutch went over the material, and he picked out the 
sound incorporated instrument. And it turned out

15:56.886 --> 16:00.530
to be very delicate and was very suitable. In fact, 
I liked it much better than one had at Cornell.

16:08.360 --> 16:17.552
But we used Dutch as a kind of a consultant on 
material, and

16:08.360 --> 16:17.552
it paid off. We'd never order anything without his 
approval. We wanted

16:23.789 --> 16:30.476
a sound recorder. He said, now listen, what kind of 
money do you have? He said, we played around with

16:36.583 --> 16:39.667
some of these cheap instruments. He had charge of 
the radio. He said, we finally had to put a, he says,

16:42.650 --> 16:46.915
don't touch it. unless you have $1,000 to spend. 
$1,000 back in those days was pretty big money. You

16:52.831 --> 16:56.696
could buy a sound recorder for $150, $200. Maybe 
somehow it was

16:56.716 --> 17:02.064
cheaper than that, I don't know. But he says, don't 
fool with them. He says, we tried several up there

17:04.728 --> 17:13.420
in that radio, and said we finally had to get a good 
sound recorder, to get a good tape. We had to

17:13.440 --> 17:14.421
spend... I've forgotten, but he said it was over a 
thousand dollars, well over a thousand dollars.

17:19.238 --> 17:21.941
He said, don't touch them unless you've got that 
much money. But we didn't have it. So we

17:25.546 --> 17:37.520
sidetracked that for a while, but oh, it made our 
class much more interesting

17:25.546 --> 17:37.520
for swallowing. Even with the swallowing air, 
what we some, we thought of doing this, that since

17:44.388 --> 18:01.774
you could hear those, the gurgling sounds of that 
air going into the cardiac portion of the stomach,

17:44.388 --> 18:01.774
and, or drinking water, you could hear it splash 
down here. And you could magnify, amplify that

18:01.794 --> 18:08.184
thing, the whole class could hear almost every 
bubble. Very interesting. Very interesting, and

18:10.908 --> 18:13.872
so... I don't know whether the students 
suggested, let him drink a Coke. Of course, well,

18:18.722 --> 18:22.426
they'd carbonate it, and I tell you, it sounded 
like a boiler factory. Oh, you could amplify that

18:23.807 --> 18:25.569
thing. They'd blast it. And so you could get the 
students' attention much more, and we'd let

18:28.011 --> 18:34.477
students use them. We had two of them. And once in a 
while, if they'd get damp, we'd have to send them

18:36.819 --> 18:39.923
in. And one thing about it, we learned that rubber 
diaphragm around it, so as if we put it down on a

18:44.885 --> 18:53.216
heart or something or on blood or anything fluid. 
We dare not get that thing damp. And like our

18:57.782 --> 19:04.651
amplifiers, Dutch told us, says, don't you ever 
get that damp. And the water spilled on it, says,

19:06.473 --> 19:09.998
it'll Well, the boys wanted those things for 
amplification on these dancers, and some of them

19:11.075 --> 19:22.254
had dancers, see, in the A&M

19:11.075 --> 19:22.254
student chapter of the AVMA. I let them have it. And 
one of them was off a little bit. I think somebody

19:29.868 --> 19:35.918
spilled a Coke or something on the thing, and so I 
couldn't let them have it. And because of that, I

19:37.417 --> 19:40.040
was worn. It was my era. But there was more and more 
demand. And then other than that, somebody else

19:45.065 --> 19:47.949
wanted to borrow it. Well, so we'll keep it here and 
keep it covered up to keep the air, keeping it from

19:48.749 --> 20:03.005
getting damp and then have it work. But you've got 
to really. warp sound of that thing, the horn.

20:09.781 --> 20:13.625
Those things were about that high and that wide, 
the two amplifiers we used. But they were

20:14.346 --> 20:15.647
excellent. Were there any other electronic 
gadgetry that you used? Oh, then we went to the

20:19.492 --> 20:27.220
Baylor University School of Medicine, the 
Physiology Department specifically. The head of

20:28.081 --> 20:33.968
the department came from Yale and He really went 
into electronics, and a private company was

20:35.230 --> 20:46.421
organized for putting those materials out. They 
called it the physiograph. First thing you know,

20:49.884 --> 21:01.896
in summer they were putting on courses in 
electronic reproduction and physiology, and

20:49.884 --> 21:01.896
people from all over the United States. from the 
veterinary school. I think they have a veterinary

21:04.045 --> 21:07.090
college in the United States. One of the young 
instructors or something down there and took it

21:07.992 --> 21:17.807
back home and the whole veterinary education was 
changed and the physiology. So now they have the

21:17.847 --> 21:29.385
department and Davis and the department and 
McCready who's head now. had some ideas, and Mac

21:30.074 --> 21:34.700
Murray, they took that course. Price went down 
when he resigned the deanship, why he went down to

21:34.780 --> 21:42.791
take that course at Baylor. But

21:42.811 --> 21:48.959
I told him, I said, okay, you youngsters go after 
it. I said, I'm too old to fool with some of that

21:48.999 --> 21:51.242
stuff. I'm going to stay with some of this old 
material. And I said, I still believe I can do some

21:53.825 --> 21:58.191
things that you all can't do with it. 
sophisticated material. And of course it racked

22:02.063 --> 22:11.855
my mind to think up something and racked their mind 
to refute my statement. There's one thing that I

22:11.875 --> 22:16.880
know of that they can't do with that. And I said, 
well, you're putting the students here and you're

22:17.020 --> 22:21.866
putting that material out. It's a demonstration. 
I said, I like the students to go in and get their

22:23.988 --> 22:27.132
hands dirty and get them in, let them do a lot of the 
work. That was my idea of teaching. But it came to

22:36.065 --> 22:57.844
much of a demonstration, but now the students go, 
we have, they have the students, you can take up as

22:36.065 --> 22:57.844
many as six or seven in a group, and they've got 
little cubby holes, you know, where they work, and

22:36.065 --> 22:57.844
have that material, and they work by groups. But 
all of them were wired together, and then those are

22:58.027 --> 23:10.441
hooked up to the demonstration room, the lecture 
room, and even out to the large animal. You can take

23:10.541 --> 23:19.190
the horse, for example, instead of the horse, he's 
out in the building in the back. And also with the TV

23:20.011 --> 23:26.498
station, they hook up, and it was just a closed 
circuit TV. got hooked up to the clinic and hooked

23:26.748 --> 23:32.113
up to the autopsy room. And the entire, every 
department involved, physiology, I know, and

23:33.114 --> 23:40.500
clinic. When did this come back, about all this 
closed circuit? Well, they were doing it by the

23:43.383 --> 23:46.926
time I retired. It started beforehand. We had gone 
physiographs. We had physiographs stacked

23:50.189 --> 23:52.931
around like cordwood. And we were going to that 
entirely. In the meantime, I remember going up to

23:56.937 --> 24:03.844
St. Paul in Minneapolis. The veterinary school is 
at St. Paul, the medical school in Minneapolis.

24:09.269 --> 24:19.319
And I remember going up there, and they in the 
veterinary and the physiology department, they

24:09.269 --> 24:19.319
were still using the old man, a chymograph. And 
they were doing a good job, but they felt that on

24:20.860 --> 24:26.826
graduate work, they'd let them do that. But we were 
the first ones that let the students get into it and

24:27.413 --> 24:32.359
prepared that lab. And I was putting our heads 
together to try to get that thing worked up

24:32.419 --> 24:41.431
architecturally to fit them. And it is to fit the 
students. And a lot of that was accomplished

24:43.694 --> 24:51.083
after, or it was in the process of being done when I 
retired. But that whole I think we started on

24:56.945 --> 25:06.239
electronics in 36, 37 I think, mostly 37, 38, 
somewhere along there. We got interested in it. In

25:09.725 --> 25:14.973
your department, was there a tendency toward more 
specialization over the years? Yes, I used to

25:16.976 --> 25:21.383
think that we'd rotate. instructors in 
physiology and pharmacology. In fact, Dr.

25:26.128 --> 25:28.671
Schmidt has that in his statement. He asked, who 
taught this, who taught that? I said, Dr. Schmidt,

25:31.515 --> 25:34.760
my idea was rotating these men. I said, if they go on 
and get promoted or go to some other school, they

25:37.063 --> 25:46.577
will have had experience in these others. From my 
viewpoint, but now from old from, Eads was more

25:52.227 --> 26:00.935
interested in pharmacology, I turned it over to 
him, gladly. It's hard to teach. And I'd take

26:03.497 --> 26:13.586
toxicology, and then one of the others would take 
physiology, Kazuski, and Farat, and then

26:03.497 --> 26:13.586
Kazuski. And Eads and I both worked on physiology. 
I still kept my hands in on physiology, what the

26:18.250 --> 26:21.593
others I more or less took what the others left. And 
I'd give them a choice of what they wanted to go

26:24.871 --> 26:27.293
into. And because I think, first of all, they 
should be kept happy. And I figured they'd stay

26:38.343 --> 26:44.028
there longer if they were happy and teaching what 
they wanted. And if they wanted to rotate, it was

26:45.289 --> 26:48.292
all right. But since then, it's become more and 
more From year to year, it became more and more

26:52.555 --> 26:55.217
specialized. Why do you think that is? I don't 
know. I took some courses. The reason I wanted

26:58.921 --> 27:20.380
toxicology, because I had gone to Iowa State and 
had taken taxonomy,

26:58.921 --> 27:20.380
plant classification, from probably the leading 
taxonomist in the country, Dr. Pamel, L.H. Pamel.

27:21.783 --> 27:24.647
and noted botanist. In fact, he was one of the first 
ones to work on cotton root rot here in the

27:25.348 --> 27:29.893
Experiment Station. He and Dr. Francis became 
friends, and that was in the late 80s, early 90s.

27:40.467 --> 27:51.621
And

27:40.467 --> 27:51.621
he was on loan from the Shaw Botanical Gardens of 
St. Louis to the college, In fact, he initiated

27:52.327 --> 27:55.850
that work on cotton root rot. Then Dr. Taubenhaus 
came in and took it over.

28:04.778 --> 28:14.126
But then I had taken graduate work in poisonous 
plants from Dr. Pamel, a spire problems course.

28:15.627 --> 28:21.152
And he,

28:15.627 --> 28:21.152
one of his daughters married a veterinarian who 
was on the faculty at Gainesville, the University

28:21.824 --> 28:29.012
of Florida. And

28:29.953 --> 28:44.608
he had become interested in poisonous plants, and 
so Dr. Pimel got to know practically every large

28:29.953 --> 28:44.608
animal practitioner in the state of Florida. And 
he collected piles of specimens. And he said, go

28:49.921 --> 28:54.446
through and classify those plants. And he had just 
collected them the summer before, the winter

28:54.466 --> 29:00.212
before, see. He'd take his vacations in January or 
February, and he'd go down there, and of course

29:01.774 --> 29:12.966
that still would have lush growth down in Florida.

29:12.986 --> 29:15.088
But, oh, hundreds of plants. And he says, classify 
those. I learned some taxonomy. That's the way to

29:22.882 --> 29:24.303
learn it. And I had my desk in his office. He had an 
office probably as big as this living room. And so I

29:32.813 --> 29:40.321
had a microscope and a little desk table in one 
corner. He was head of—the botany department was

29:40.341 --> 29:48.210
on the fourth floor of Central Hall at Iowa State.

29:50.097 --> 29:52.700
He had a heart condition, and he couldn't walk 
those steps. He took me up there one day, and I said,

29:53.582 --> 29:57.707
Doc, he wants to show me something. I don't recall 
now, and he says, no, I can make it. We'll just have

30:02.814 --> 30:04.275
to stop and rest. During and until we get to the top 
of each step, each level, we'd stop and rest a

30:05.177 --> 30:12.086
little. But I was sure afraid of him. But he,

30:14.969 --> 30:19.395
every day, That is the five days or six days a week. I 
think we were inside, outside the classes. His

30:28.569 --> 30:32.875
desk would come in, he had a pile of specimens would 
be sent in. He'd classify them. He'd look at them at

30:36.920 --> 30:39.964
a glance and could tell what they were. And he'd 
have the secretary dictate a letter to them. and

30:45.734 --> 30:54.665
this plant is so-and-so, and so-and-so, and give 
something about the history of it, referring to

30:45.734 --> 30:54.665
the notes. And it amazed me. And up until that time, 
of course, I was animal-minded. And I could see

31:04.476 --> 31:09.402
these, of course, in summer of 27. That was before 
the Depression. All the barns and the houses were

31:14.759 --> 31:17.603
well painted. And some of those farms were just 
garden spots. I'd take him out on Saturdays. He

31:23.851 --> 31:24.452
wouldn't drive. He didn't drive. And he might get a 
letter. It might be 50 or 60 miles from Ames, and

31:29.059 --> 31:33.004
we'd go out there. I'd take him out there in my car. 
And I got to seeing these hogs and these dairy

31:36.829 --> 31:43.939
cattle and these beef animals and these horses.
