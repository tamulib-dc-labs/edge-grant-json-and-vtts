WEBVTT

00:03.035 --> 00:06.019
Testing, testing, one, two, three, four. And I'll 
five, six, seven, eight. I guess it's working okay

00:08.022 --> 00:09.564
now. Okay. This is Thursday, a sunny Thursday, 
March 15 at 1205 Winding Road. And I have the

00:23.924 --> 00:29.172
pleasure and honor of chatting with Dr. Donald. 
Don Lewis. Don, Don Lewis, L-E-W-I-S. Don, to

00:33.528 --> 00:40.416
begin with, introduce yourself to anyone who 
might hear this tape or read the transcription.

00:40.977 --> 00:45.382
Describe, give us a biographical sketch before 
you got to A&M. Where'd you grow up? Family, go to

00:46.463 --> 00:49.327
high school, college, and so forth. Well, I grew up 
in Rotan, Texas. It's a small community out in West

00:54.513 --> 00:59.719
Texas about 60 miles northwest of Abilene. The 
high school was the Roten yellow hammers that's

01:03.937 --> 01:29.657
somewhat unique and that and someone and I'm it 
might have been you that told me the origin of the of

01:03.937 --> 01:29.657
the someone told me the origin of that but I've 
never seen a yellow hammer frankly oh which a bird

01:03.937 --> 01:29.657
yes oh yes yes yes I know it's a bird but I I didn't see 
any out there anyway um I was one of those

01:30.683 --> 01:38.472
individuals that started at five and graduated a 
year earlier. What did mom and dad do? Dad worked at

01:41.836 --> 01:44.058
the National Gypsum Company. Rotan happens to be, 
at that time, it was probably the world's largest

01:46.040 --> 01:54.370
store of gypsum. There's an extremely large store 
of gypsum in that area. So that part of the country,

01:58.730 --> 02:15.129
or at least that small community, had the

01:58.730 --> 02:15.129
fame of being a large gypsum place and near a very 
large pool of oil. A lot of people in the small town

02:15.149 --> 02:21.517
of Snyder got very wealthy almost overnight. We 
unfortunately weren't one of those. So I went to

02:26.455 --> 02:33.903
high school at Rotan and graduated in 1953. Then I

02:34.123 --> 02:49.959
was actually offered a music scholarship to two 
places, to Tarleton and to actually the

02:34.123 --> 02:49.959
University of Texas. And I guess that came from the 
fact that I was in the band and I had gone to all state

02:53.978 --> 03:03.389
band and that sort of thing, which was smart.

03:03.669 --> 03:09.676
Music has always been an avocation of mine and I 
really enjoyed playing and have always enjoyed

03:03.669 --> 03:09.676
music. But my first year I went to Tarleton

03:11.258 --> 03:20.509
and then from there I went to the University of 
Texas. and I didn't feel that I had time at least at

03:21.653 --> 03:45.265
the University of Texas the symphony and the 
various music activities demanded a lot of time

03:21.653 --> 03:45.265
which I didn't feel that I had because my intention 
was to go to medical school and at that time and

03:21.653 --> 03:45.265
perhaps less so now than it was then getting into 
medical school was very very competitive and so I

03:45.920 --> 04:11.539
had to maintain you know a pretty good grade point 
average in order to be in order for it to be a

03:45.920 --> 04:11.539
realistic goal well I did go on through the paces 
and I had many odd jobs one odd job involved

04:12.903 --> 04:15.687
I played in a small combo. We used to sing and play at 
various fraternities and made, you know, I have

04:16.748 --> 04:22.336
gigs on the weekends. What did you play? Trombone. 
And I sang, I sang, we, we, the group that were doing

04:25.761 --> 04:32.611
this weren't using any music. We would listen to a 
record and try to duplicate it as best we could to

04:32.671 --> 04:42.825
duplicate the sound that they were having and I'm 
not sure Whether we did or didn't, but anyway, we

04:43.244 --> 04:46.228
had a lot of fun doing that. In fact, too much fun one 
semester. So I stopped doing that and took a job.

04:55.040 --> 05:06.875
Actually, I took a job at the Austin State 
Hospital, which was a real good job and sort of in

04:55.040 --> 05:06.875
tune with what my career goals were at that time. It 
gave me room, board, and laundry. and $175 a month,

05:12.893 --> 05:17.118
which was a lot of money at that time. So I worked 
there for a while, and then I

05:18.860 --> 05:31.894
had an opportunity to work in another, to go to 
another place. I had state funding and that sort of

05:32.475 --> 05:37.500
thing, and even had what, I believe it was called 
Teacher's Retirement, but I wasn't there long

05:38.071 --> 05:41.014
enough. I was there for about a year and a half. And 
went to work for a place called Brown Schools,

05:44.017 --> 05:51.544
which was a school for emotionally disturbed 
kiddos. And not that that was necessarily my

05:52.465 --> 06:01.713
career interest, but I thought it would be an 
interesting job because I did kind of like to work

05:52.465 --> 06:01.713
with youth anyway. And it was there that I met 
Carol, Carol, my wife. and she was interested in

06:07.130 --> 06:31.078
becoming a, ultimately she became a counselor, 
but she was going to Texas Woman's University and I

06:07.130 --> 06:31.078
was still at the University of Texas with the 
objective of going to medical school at the

06:07.130 --> 06:31.078
end of my, after graduation. and so we worked, 
Carol and I worked together as counselors and

06:32.797 --> 06:58.703
among other counselors at the Brown School and 
then she went back to TWU and I was still at the

06:32.797 --> 06:58.703
University of Texas and finally I finished and at 
that time you know we were all subject to draft if we

06:32.797 --> 06:58.703
weren't in school and so I had applied to medical 
school and I didn't get in the first time. So I

07:04.531 --> 07:05.872
wondered what I was gonna do. And then the draft 
board was breathing down my neck saying that, you

07:06.473 --> 07:17.324
know, you need to either be in school or we need to, 
you know. So I signed up to go into the army and I

07:17.344 --> 07:24.351
signed up as a medical laboratory specialist. Now 
I was one of the few In those days, of course, it's

07:27.944 --> 07:41.985
common these days for enlisted

07:27.944 --> 07:41.985
people to have degrees and not be commissioned, 
but it was very unusual during those days. So I went

07:43.427 --> 07:52.180
in as a non-commissioned person, and during a 
basic training, they did these various tests and

07:52.801 --> 08:22.116
it just so happened that I had been a ham radio 
operator when I was in high school and I knew Morse

07:52.801 --> 08:22.116
code very well and I'd enlisted to be a medical 
laboratory specialist but when they found that I

07:52.801 --> 08:22.116
was proficient in Morse code they really tried to 
push me to go into into the signal core in fact they

07:52.801 --> 08:22.116
tried to push me to go into uh all the the secret 
service and that sort of thing you know that they

08:22.619 --> 08:50.162
want you to well I convinced them that I didn't want 
to do that and so I did go and take medical training

08:22.619 --> 08:50.162
and then during this time Carol and I were still 
communicating and

08:22.619 --> 08:50.162
I was going to be an instructor there at Sam Houston 
Fort Sam Houston And because the commanding

08:50.969 --> 08:56.457
officer wanted me to be, I was one of the few people 
that had a degree. Well, my major was zoology, but I

08:58.981 --> 09:06.031
had a lot of hours in microbiology and a lot of hours 
in chemistry. I'm not sure whether this is the sort

09:06.532 --> 09:16.487
of thing you want or not, but this is just a stream of 
thought.

09:17.159 --> 09:23.548
And I had pretty strong foundations in those 
areas, so they wanted to keep me there at San

09:17.159 --> 09:23.548
Antonio. And I thought, man, this will be great. 
Carol can go ahead and finish up her degree, and

09:25.971 --> 09:39.269
I'll be there in San Antonio, and we can... Well, it 
just so happened that there was an E-5, a sergeant.

09:40.210 --> 09:42.733
I was a private E-2 at that time. And... He wanted to 
go to Germany because his wife was from Germany and

09:45.560 --> 09:59.033
I wanted to stay there because my fiance was in 
Texas and I thought this was going to be ideal.

10:01.315 --> 10:15.128
Something happened, the orders got switched and 
Sergeant, which I wasn't a sergeant, I was

10:01.315 --> 10:15.128
private, Sergeant Donald Lewis was going to go to 
the UCR medical lab and private I've forgotten

10:16.036 --> 10:42.128
what the sergeant's name was now was to stay there 
for instruction and he didn't have the training he

10:16.036 --> 10:42.128
I don't think he had a college I don't think he had 
any college training and so he really tried to talk

10:16.036 --> 10:42.128
to the powers that be that so that he could go to 
Germany and and and I really tried to talk to the

10:16.036 --> 10:42.128
powers to be so that I could stay there but it didn't 
work out that way so oh that was the biggest crisis

10:16.036 --> 10:42.128
of our life And so we, I went, so we went on, I went on 
over to Germany, not knowing really what I was, you

10:42.563 --> 10:56.216
know, Carol and I were going to be apart for three 
years and I'm not sure we'd be the same person, you

10:42.563 --> 10:56.216
know, afterwards. So,

10:56.236 --> 11:02.922
so we, so I did go on to Germany. And while there, I 
met the, I was, I was with, with a great group of

11:03.623 --> 11:11.710
people. One person who really had a lot of 
influence on my training and on my future career,

11:13.073 --> 11:29.437
Ken Dirks, he lives in this community, 
incidentally. Spell Dirks. D-I-R-K-S. He was a

11:33.503 --> 11:34.985
major at that time. Later on, I found that he became 
a, you know after I'd gone and everything he became

11:38.993 --> 12:01.963
a major general but he he was also a one of one of the I 
don't know if this interim or what but he was a dean

11:38.993 --> 12:01.963
here at the at the medical school here

11:38.993 --> 12:01.963
but he was you know he and his family were great well 
Carol graduated she she She took 21 hours a

12:02.332 --> 12:12.282
semester and pushed through getting through and 
so she, to kind of make a long story short, she met me

12:02.332 --> 12:12.282
over in Germany and we lived on the economy. At that 
time I wasn't eligible for housing on the post so we

12:13.444 --> 12:26.437
lived on the economy and we lived off of my salary 
for what we could, you know, what we could on the

12:13.444 --> 12:26.437
economy. And because we both kind of had an 
interest in you know, youth and child, you know,

12:31.272 --> 12:35.117
child development and that sort of thing. Let's 
see, seems like someone, my commanding officer,

12:37.741 --> 12:49.918
not Ken, but my commanding officer asked if we 
would stay with their kiddos for two weeks while

12:37.741 --> 12:49.918
they went on annual leave. And so we did, and again, 
to make a long story short, we stayed more in

12:51.460 --> 13:00.773
people's houses doing that than, than anything 
else. And we, you know, I stayed, I stayed in, in

13:04.406 --> 13:14.179
generals and we stayed in general squatters and, 
and things like that. And, and a lot of times before

13:14.859 --> 13:22.069
they knew what we were doing, they, they were, you 
know, what are you, private, what are you walking

13:14.859 --> 13:22.069
over here for? So,

13:22.729 --> 13:31.080
um, the, the experience at, and this was in 
Landstuhl, spell that L-A-N-D-S-T-H-U-L

13:31.465 --> 13:56.022
it was the USAR reference laboratory for Europe 
and so I mean it was just like a college campus and as

13:31.465 --> 13:56.022
far as I know it's still still very much that way 
it's sort of the army reference laboratory for for

13:31.465 --> 13:56.022
Europe so I got some experiences that I I don't 
believe I could have gotten anywhere else I was

13:56.693 --> 14:25.671
exposed to you know various techniques for cell 
culture which was kind of new at that time was kind

13:56.693 --> 14:25.671
of instrumental in in developing 
immunofluorescence or fluorescence antibody

13:56.693 --> 14:25.671
techniques for that lab at that time and let's see 
we also there well this was during the this was in

13:56.693 --> 14:25.671
1960 when the when the reserves were activated, 
the army reserves were activated, and a number of

14:26.461 --> 14:49.702
people were suddenly, their lives were just 
suddenly turned around, so they suddenly showed

14:26.461 --> 14:49.702
up over there in Germany, and they were going to be 
there for a couple of three, at least a couple of

14:26.461 --> 14:49.702
three months, and perhaps longer, because this 
was the Berlin Wall crisis, the beginning of the

14:26.461 --> 14:49.702
Berlin Wall crisis. And I'm assuming that these 
experiences are adding to your uh health care yeah

14:56.363 --> 15:16.729
my goal yeah whatever of some sort yeah and please 
let me know if if this is not what you want because I

14:56.363 --> 15:16.729
this again like I say this is just stream of 
conscious now then you come back about when yeah um

14:56.363 --> 15:16.729
I come back in uh 62. 62

15:16.749 --> 15:24.058
I thought that I would go back and and I was kind of 
fearful of jumping right back into a medical

15:24.663 --> 15:36.495
school program, because I was fairly confident I 
wouldn't have had much problem getting in,

15:24.663 --> 15:36.495
particularly with my background. And so I decided 
I'd pursue a degree program, but I decided that it

15:38.417 --> 15:53.893
would probably be smarter for me to go to a place 
where I wouldn't have to work quite as hard for a

15:38.417 --> 15:53.893
graduate degree as the University of Texas might 
be. did a master's degree at Southwest Texas,

15:54.717 --> 15:58.806
which proved to be a very good thing. I was doing 
some things that were kind of cutting edge from my

16:00.389 --> 16:08.126
Army experience. I was working with 
Bacteriophage and Salmonella. and what that does

16:15.085 --> 16:30.445
is at that time I was working with mapping genes 
with bacteriophage which is really pretty far

16:15.085 --> 16:30.445
advanced and the only reason why it wasn't because 
I was so clever but it was because I had been exposed

16:30.425 --> 16:53.158
to some of that type of material in the in the army so 
and my my thesis has to do with with the

16:30.425 --> 16:53.158
transduction in salmonella and that sort of thing 
so then after getting that finished I thought well

16:30.425 --> 16:53.158
I think I'm ready to so I went on made it made the 
application for for medical school I really

16:54.640 --> 16:56.702
preferred to stay here in Texas. And let's see, 
Texas Tech didn't have a school at that time. I

17:02.448 --> 17:06.953
believe there were two schools, Southwest Texas 
and Galveston. And so I applied to those two

17:07.553 --> 17:10.656
schools, and I was called for an interview. And I 
was called for an interview. On one of the

17:14.600 --> 17:20.206
interviews, I went up to Dallas for the interview. 
And our first son had came along at that time. which

17:25.488 --> 17:54.685
and we were still in financial straits we stayed in 
financial straits for most of most even even for a

17:25.488 --> 17:54.685
short short period of time even while I was a 
faculty member here so Donald our oldest son was

17:25.488 --> 17:54.685
born at that time and we were somewhat in debt from 
our from my school days there in in southwest Texas

17:25.488 --> 17:54.685
and so I was coming back from from Dallas and uh I was 
gonna I was on my way to the farm, Carol's parents

17:55.323 --> 18:24.469
farm in Thorndale and and I stopped at uh I happened 
to stop here in College Station because that

17:55.323 --> 18:24.469
happened to be one route by which I could get to 
Thorndale and there's a as we mentioned the other

17:55.323 --> 18:24.469
day there's a service there was a service station a 
Sinclair service station where Cafe XL is now and

17:55.323 --> 18:24.469
uh I was just kind of talking. I just said, you know, 
I wish, what do they have here on this campus? And we

18:32.772 --> 18:46.170
got to, me and one of the guys was visiting there, 
and it just so happened that there was a student

18:32.772 --> 18:46.170
there that said, you know, I've heard that they've 
got some assistantships out at the vet school.

18:47.892 --> 18:50.556
Well, veterinary medicine was the furthest thing 
from my mind. But I thought, well, you know, I could

18:56.005 --> 19:02.635
get into a holding pattern at least, and maybe we 
could get out of this financial strait that we're

18:56.005 --> 19:02.635
in. And so I went out and talked to, actually, 
Leland. Leland Grumbles. Leland Grumbles and

19:07.782 --> 19:11.047
Charlie Hall, the other Charlie Hall. And they 
said, yeah, we'd like for you to consider coming

19:12.449 --> 19:20.320
here. I said, well, I've got a master's degree. I'm 
not interested in pursuing. Well, we'd like for

19:26.465 --> 19:27.626
you to come here. We didn't want you to come here. We 
would like for you to pursue a Ph.D. And this is

19:29.108 --> 19:35.836
Veterinary Microbiology? Veterinary 
Microbiology. And when is this? This is 66.

19:44.846 --> 19:45.828
No, no, 64. Fall of 64? Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, 
actually summer. I mean, getting ready for the

19:50.393 --> 19:53.096
fall. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So I came on board. I came and 
started, you know, as a graduate student. What did

20:01.053 --> 20:05.941
they offer you in terms of compensation and 
assignments? Well, I believe the amount was, it

20:05.961 --> 20:13.012
seemed like it was about $8,000 or $10,000. I mean, 
at that time, and to me, that was a fantastic

20:13.453 --> 20:17.720
amount. And this was for a 12-month task? Yes, 
uh-huh. What were your duties? Well, primarily to

20:24.342 --> 20:37.377
pursue graduate work, but to help in the 
instruction in microbiology, because I had a

20:24.342 --> 20:37.377
pretty strong background, I mean, you know, in 
microbiology. Describe your first duties. Well,

20:41.261 --> 20:44.785
we had students the vet students, because there 
wasn't a very big graduate program at that time. So

20:50.877 --> 20:53.781
I was to lecture to the vet students and help in the 
labs. What course or courses? Microbiology. What

20:58.729 --> 21:00.592
year for them? It was their second year. They were 
second year students at that time. Describe the

21:07.182 --> 21:10.046
students at that time. Well, Let's see, I'm trying 
to think of some of the students I knew. I don't know

21:20.552 --> 21:24.938
whether you want me to use names or not. You use 
names wherever it would help. Yeah, I don't think I

21:28.163 --> 21:38.397
will use names, but there were a couple of three 
students that had gone to Southwest Texas while I

21:28.163 --> 21:38.397
was a graduate student. and they were in vet school 
at that time and so they were the students were I

21:38.663 --> 22:04.536
think consistently the students the vet students 
have been certainly cut above the usual

21:38.663 --> 22:04.536
undergraduates

21:38.663 --> 22:04.536
these were all male all male all male all male yes no 
no females at that as far as I know there weren't any

21:38.663 --> 22:04.536
and no minority no black none whatsoever okay 
right and in terms of their background as far as you

22:04.972 --> 22:34.911
recall where did they come from were they urban 
kids or no there was a good mix they were they were no

22:04.972 --> 22:34.911
there wasn't a good they were primarily rural they 
were rural primarily rural the the urban I suspect

22:04.972 --> 22:34.911
that most of the kiddos that were urban there were a 
lot of people that that went that went to that were

22:35.296 --> 22:40.883
planning to go to medical school that came to 
veterinary school, I think, as a secondary

22:35.296 --> 22:40.883
option. That's the sense that I had from, I mean, a 
fairly significant number of people that were

22:41.263 --> 22:51.616
just wanting to be in some sort of health care. What 
kind of orientation or prep or training or

22:52.357 --> 23:00.967
anything did they give you before you walked? Oh, 
boy, I walked in cold. walked in cold and I was not a

23:03.443 --> 23:24.253
you know I was kind of a I've never been one to be you 
know comfortable unless I'm singing or something

23:03.443 --> 23:24.253
like that lecturing but I soon felt like I was in my 
element And what year in vet school were these

23:24.554 --> 23:28.679
students? Second year. Second year. I believe 
they were second. Yeah, they were second year. And

23:32.683 --> 23:34.025
some of them were pretty challenging. They would 
challenge me, but I feel like I was up to the task

23:34.185 --> 23:43.275
because I had practical experience in dealing 
with them. About what size were the sections you

23:43.295 --> 23:46.739
were teaching and the number? Let's see. Oh, gee. 
It's primarily in the labs. Okay.

23:56.380 --> 23:57.802
So would this be a dozen or so? No, no, there were 
about 40 or 50. The labs were arranged so that there

24:02.429 --> 24:15.148
were two large laboratories and then we kind of put 
together the media and explained how to interpret

24:02.429 --> 24:15.148
the reactions and you know how to streak plates and 
how to isolate the organisms and and that sort of

24:15.854 --> 24:42.115
thing now were you doing this alone or was there 
someone else no there was someone else there was uh

24:15.854 --> 24:42.115
no as a matter of fact well no there were some other 
there were some others there were actually um

24:15.854 --> 24:42.115
there was a person um i'll use his name jim grimes He 
had had experience with the Texas Department of

24:42.365 --> 25:11.038
Public Health and a fellow by the name of Gordon 
Welch who had actually gone to medical school for

24:42.365 --> 25:11.038
three years and I never did know why he dropped out 
but he came back to get a PhD and myself

24:42.365 --> 25:11.038
and there was one other person who had graduated 
about four years earlier as a veterinarian, and he

25:11.322 --> 25:15.167
was coming back to do graduate work. I think we four 
were the first, if not the first, among the first of

25:15.187 --> 25:24.320
the people that were pursuing, you know, on the 
Ph.D. type program. Now, who was the department

25:24.340 --> 25:29.087
head and who was directing this activity? Leland 
Grumbles was the department head, a fellow by the

25:29.968 --> 25:34.134
name of Paul Youngerman. Y-O-U-N? No, it's 
J-U-N-G-E-R. And I think he might be another

25:39.959 --> 25:45.807
source of stories. Now, he has a lot of stories, 
some of which are fabrications, I'm sure, because

25:45.927 --> 25:55.359
he was a great story spinner. But Youngerman was in 
charge of microbiology. Grumbles was the

26:02.228 --> 26:04.110
department head. Archie Flowers.

26:10.604 --> 26:15.310
was sort of in charge of, had some 
responsibilities in the lab. But they primarily

26:15.890 --> 26:29.847
turned it over to us because those

26:15.890 --> 26:29.847
guys, Jargeman and, really had never worked in a 
laboratory situation. And here, I had worked for

26:30.748 --> 26:39.598
three years in an army, you know, medical 
laboratory, reference medical laboratory

26:30.748 --> 26:39.598
situation. And Jim Grimes had worked in the public 
health department in Austin. And Jim was about 30,

26:45.685 --> 26:53.071
35 at the time. I was the youngest one. I was about 28 
or 29, I think. And Gordon was, he had been a medical

26:59.017 --> 27:09.366
student, but he, as I say, I never really knew why he 
didn't, didn't finish but he came back and he was he

27:10.460 --> 27:40.298
had had some experience the point is that that 
really we were probably better prepared to to do

27:10.460 --> 27:40.298
the laboratory than than some of the people that 
were supposed to be doing it really did anybody sit

27:10.460 --> 27:40.298
down with y'all and give you any guidelines any 
directions uh on an ad hoc basis and how what were

27:10.460 --> 27:40.298
some of their what was some of their advice their 
guidance well um Most of the times they would say,

27:42.488 --> 28:03.990
and let's see,

27:42.488 --> 28:03.990
they would say, don't be too wordy, make it short 
and succinct and follow these guidelines, follow

27:42.488 --> 28:03.990
this, this that we've, they had outlined some 
materials. And don't tolerate any cheating.

28:13.724 --> 28:17.429
And if you, well, and if you encounter any 
problems, let us know. Describe a tip for you.

28:20.494 --> 28:22.357
Describe a typical work day. As a graduate 
student. At that time. What time did you get to the

28:27.264 --> 28:31.069
campus, and what did you do for how long? Oh, this 
was kind of an exciting time for me. So I would get to

28:38.100 --> 28:39.141
work. I would usually get to work about 7.30 or so, 
maybe even earlier. And the first year that I was

28:45.886 --> 28:56.236
there, I was taking, I guess, a relatively heavy 
load. I was taking biochemistry,

28:56.276 --> 29:00.921
radiation biology. So I would do some studying at 
first. But I was so glad to be doing some real,

29:05.346 --> 29:08.689
quote, quote unquote real research, I would 
review some of the material that I'd gotten. The

29:17.488 --> 29:20.993
medical sciences library was right down the way 
from where my office was. So I would spend some time

29:21.674 --> 29:27.641
in the medical, and usually there were people 
there beginning at about 7 o'clock. And so

29:28.443 --> 29:32.768
sometimes I'd go down there and have a chance to 
look over some materials. And then I'd go to class,

29:32.828 --> 29:36.313
say, Didn't have too many 8 o'clock classes, so I'd 
go to class about 9 o'clock. I had Mac Prescott.

29:44.464 --> 29:45.986
Maybe I shouldn't be using that. No, no, don't. No, 
dude. Describe Professor Prescott as a graduate

29:48.129 --> 29:52.515
instructor. He was an outstanding individual. 
Truly outstanding. And I bet he took everything

29:58.303 --> 30:02.628
seriously. Very seriously. You bet. In fact... 
This was a graduate level, a graduate level

30:06.820 --> 30:10.805
biochemistry course. And most, I didn't know that 
at the time, but most graduate courses, it's just

30:12.186 --> 30:20.096
sort of, you automatically make a B or better. 
There were lots of people in his class that didn't

30:21.658 --> 30:24.281
pass. I'm not surprised. He pressed very hard, but 
he was just a very interesting, well, It was very

30:36.672 --> 30:50.204
structured, but very,

30:36.672 --> 30:50.204
I enjoyed his class very much, but I was one of the 
few that did. I

30:50.224 --> 30:59.753
found him to be easy to converse with outside of 
class. In fact, I would often visit with him about

31:00.754 --> 31:05.278
one thing or another. One thing that I was 
particularly interested in and the problem that I

31:05.917 --> 31:20.365
was working on, I hadn't zeroed in on a particular 
problem, but I was interested in the use of

31:05.917 --> 31:20.365
electrophoretic

31:05.917 --> 31:20.365
procedures.
