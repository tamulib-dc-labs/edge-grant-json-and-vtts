WEBVTT

00:05.431 --> 00:09.435
So each time we turned the tape over, then we had 
that 15-second protective delay.

00:13.299 --> 00:16.742
Now, first, Professor Fleming, I'd like to know 
what interested you in the sea. Why did you choose

00:16.762 --> 00:19.425
the sea as a profession? Well, I was studying as a 
chemist at the University of British Columbia and

00:20.987 --> 00:35.421
completed my bachelor's degree in 1929 and stayed 
on at the at the University of British Columbia,

00:36.380 --> 00:40.824
take a master's degree in chemistry. And this, as 
you should recognize, was the beginning of the

00:41.645 --> 00:48.010
Depression. And it was quite obvious to me that 
there were more chemists than were going to be

00:48.030 --> 01:05.425
needed, and that it was particularly difficult to 
obtain any sort of graduate student support in

00:48.030 --> 01:05.425
chemistry. And I had become somewhat bored with 
the field of chemistry and thought I'd better seek

01:06.029 --> 01:14.480
some other area. And I'd grown up right by the 
water, and many of my friends were essentially

01:15.481 --> 01:22.451
marine biologists. And I happened to hear about 
this field called oceanography, and it seemed

01:22.471 --> 01:28.238
very intriguing. So I was able to obtain a research 
assistantship at Scripps Institution.

01:35.257 --> 01:38.863
California in 1931 down there.

01:41.607 --> 01:43.950
Had you not been to Scripps before you acquired it? 
No. In those days one didn't travel very much. It

01:50.120 --> 01:53.184
was a major expedition to get to Southern 
California. Actually, I went down by ship. Did you

01:59.394 --> 02:03.981
know with whom you wished to work at Scripps when 
you went?

02:04.703 --> 02:33.208
Really I expected to work in chemistry and at that 
time the chemist at Scripps was Eric Moberg and I

02:04.703 --> 02:33.208
did essentially work with him for a number of years 
although I moved out of the field of chemical

02:04.703 --> 02:33.208
oceanography after a few years and became 
involved in sort of descriptive physical

02:04.703 --> 02:33.208
oceanography. How long were you at Scripps? Well, 
I was there as a graduate student for four years,

02:35.969 --> 02:56.111
and I completed my PhD in 1935, and then was kept on 
in a sort of research capacity for one year just as

02:35.969 --> 02:56.111
an assistant. And then in 1936, I was appointed as 
an instructor on the faculty at Scripps, and this

03:03.192 --> 03:14.928
was at the time that Harold Sverdrup had just been 
appointed and came in as the director, which he did

03:03.192 --> 03:14.928
in September of 1936. When did you first acquire 
the idea of the textbook that became the standard

03:16.430 --> 03:20.676
in the field? Well, this came more or less by 
accident, as a lot of these things do, that Scripps

03:21.177 --> 03:31.191
had never had any particular program in sort of 
education, and when Harold Spadrup came as the

03:31.492 --> 04:01.026
director, he felt that we ought to be doing more in 
this line, and he started some summer courses in

03:31.492 --> 04:01.026
oceanography, sort of a general survey course, 
and he and Martin Johnson and I were the principal

03:31.492 --> 04:01.026
lecturers, and The Prentice Hall Publishing 
Company apparently heard about this through

04:01.765 --> 04:13.466
their grapevine and came down and suggested that 
we write down our lecture notes. And being all

04:13.907 --> 04:18.516
innocent, we said, yes, we would be willing to do 
so. And it was out of this summer course in

04:19.838 --> 04:25.208
oceanography that that the volume on the oceans 
finally appeared. It took us about three years to

04:30.119 --> 04:35.006
write it, and it was finished in 1942. What sort of 
work were you doing at Scripps while you were

04:36.528 --> 04:39.232
there? Oh, I went down and, do you mean as a graduate 
student? As a graduate student and then old as a...

04:46.322 --> 04:52.811
I was sort of a jack of all trades and have been, I 
think, all my career. But My principal interest

04:54.230 --> 05:19.866
was originally in some sort of chemical work, and I 
did some work on the calcium carbonate problem,

04:54.230 --> 05:19.866
something on nutrients, and used to participate

04:54.230 --> 05:19.866
in the a very limited sort of seagoing program we 
had in those days. And then in 1932, I was given a

05:25.748 --> 05:49.110
leave, in a sense, and went up to Berkeley to the 
University of California to get a little bit more

05:25.748 --> 05:49.110
coursework and to prepare for my general 
examinations. When I came back to Scripps from

05:49.310 --> 06:08.668
there, early in 1933,

05:49.310 --> 06:08.668
I was told that the Navy wanted somebody to go down 
to Central America to carry out some

05:49.310 --> 06:08.668
oceanographic work on board one of the naval 
vessels. And so I went down and joined the USS

06:08.708 --> 06:17.376
Hannibal, which was a vessel used by the then Navy 
Hydrographic Office and spent several months

06:18.622 --> 06:34.048
down off the west coast of Panama and Costa Rica 
doing just sort of the field routine, which had

06:18.622 --> 06:34.048
already been sort of planned. And when I got back to 
La Jolla, the said, well, why don't you write up the

06:40.458 --> 06:43.601
results? And so this actually turned out to be my 
doctoral thesis and got me into sort of

06:43.841 --> 06:51.708
descriptive physical oceanography. That was 
what I was interested in, is when did you get this

06:52.329 --> 06:57.494
first descriptive oceanography that you were in 
in the early 30s? And you stayed with that, though,

06:58.455 --> 07:00.316
for two or three years. I think of you more there 
than as a chemical oceanographer. Oh, yes. I

07:04.160 --> 07:07.663
haven't really done any chemical oceanography. 
since that time, really, because as

07:08.099 --> 07:36.081
soon as I had finished up my thesis on this 
particular material, why, Dr. Sverdrup had

07:08.099 --> 07:36.081
arrived and

07:08.099 --> 07:36.081
was very anxious to start a more kind of systematic 
program of field work. And this developed in a sort

07:37.799 --> 08:06.743
of indirect way, as many of these enterprises did, 
in that the California Fish and Game Commission

07:37.799 --> 08:06.743
was, at that time, concerned with the problem of 
the distribution and abundance of the California

07:37.799 --> 08:06.743
sardines and wanted to do some oceanographic 
work. made available to Scripps the use of a small

08:07.735 --> 08:17.285
patrol vessel called the Bluefin. And in the early 
spring, and I think it extended up into the summer

08:18.086 --> 08:35.464
of 1937, we got our first sort of systematic series 
of observations off the Southern California

08:18.086 --> 08:35.464
coast. this continued and so on, so he became very 
much involved in essentially the regional

08:36.288 --> 08:46.138
oceanography off the coast of California. Who 
worked in the sardine fisheries activities with

08:46.658 --> 08:50.122
you? Well, we just did a

08:50.522 --> 09:04.776
certain amount of work on conventional physical 
oceanography, and a little bit of chemistry and

09:05.110 --> 09:08.534
some work on the plankton. We never became at that 
time directly involved in any of the fish studies,

09:09.776 --> 09:35.067
but the federal government had also become very 
much involved in the problem, and the two people

09:09.776 --> 09:35.067
that we dealt with a good deal were Alton B. Setty 
and Lionel Walford, both of what was then, I think,

09:09.776 --> 09:35.067
the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, although 
they changed their names often, but they were very

09:35.300 --> 09:49.479
much involved in the fisheries aspect and also the 
state fisheries. And the man in the state

09:49.579 --> 10:02.016
fisheries with whom we work very closely is now at 
USC, is Richard B. Tibby, who you run across, who is

10:02.519 --> 10:15.693
and he came down after a year or two and actually 
finished his Ph.D. at Scripps on the oceanography

10:02.519 --> 10:15.693
of the California coast. Now, this is really the 
first time the Pacific coast is being mapped, is

10:15.713 --> 10:22.761
when you're mapping it now in these several years. 
Were you surprised about certain things? Well, I

10:27.206 --> 10:31.851
think it's yes and no.

10:33.248 --> 10:47.807
that because of the interest in the sardine 
problem, the region was more or less prescribed

10:33.248 --> 10:47.807
for us. And yet within that area, which extended 
off the coast, I imagine about a couple of hundred

10:47.827 --> 10:59.542
miles, they wanted considerable detail. So I 
think one of the things that was rather original

11:03.556 --> 11:14.807
was the fact that we made repeated studies on a 
fairly closely spaced network of stations. And

11:14.827 --> 11:21.553
this showed details that were essentially 
unanticipated, certainly. And also, Professor

11:22.674 --> 11:31.302
Sverdrup in particular became very interested in 
the role of upwelling as it affected these waters

11:32.041 --> 11:34.524
to the south of Point Conception. And I think we had 
some of the first sort of evidence on the existence

11:36.226 --> 11:47.961
of eddies in the area that these sort of features 
had not been identified before.

11:51.746 --> 11:54.629
Who was joining you in Scripps between, let's say, 
35 on? You seem to have a whole series of people come

11:55.670 --> 11:59.035
in at Scripps about this time. Who go on?

12:02.990 --> 12:28.963
The biggest changes occurred, I feel, in about 
1931,

12:02.990 --> 12:28.963
which was just about the time I went there as a 
graduate student, and that Dr. Vaughn, who was the

12:02.990 --> 12:28.963
director, had been able to get some additional 
funds, and he had a really a very imaginative sort

12:29.483 --> 12:36.471
of view of what ought to be done at that time. And he 
added two faculty people, Claude Zobel in

12:37.072 --> 12:51.109
microbiology and Dennis Fox essentially in 
physiology and biochemistry. And this

12:52.231 --> 12:59.119
represented a major kind of shift in what was going 
on at Scripps. The physical area and the field

12:59.892 --> 13:28.262
work, there were no sort of major additions to the

12:59.892 --> 13:28.262
faculty and staff, except during these years we 
had considerable support from people who were

12:59.892 --> 13:28.262
provided to the institution under the WPA, the 
Works Progress Administration. One of the

13:29.474 --> 13:52.097
curious things is that the illustrations in my 
thesis were all drawn by a man whose background had

13:29.474 --> 13:52.097
been in architecture and was being supported on 
these federal funds, and all my graphs looked like

13:29.474 --> 13:52.097
architectural drawings. But we had considerable 
staff support, technician support in those days,

13:58.060 --> 14:02.006
people who were assigned to scripts under the WPA 
program. Gene LaFond was one person who worked

14:04.409 --> 14:15.286
very closely with this program, with Mr. Drip and 
I, and that was about it. Things weren't quite as

14:16.467 --> 14:19.512
large as they are today. Did you find much exchange 
among the faculty in that time? In other words,

14:22.416 --> 14:25.080
were you able to come to Let's say people like 
Martin Johnson and talk about your problems, many

14:25.651 --> 14:30.116
meetings, this sort of thing? Not particularly. 
As far as the kind of research work was concerned,

14:33.659 --> 14:43.970
everybody did their own particular job. But as I 
mentioned a few minutes ago, we did collect

14:44.150 --> 14:53.380
plankton samples on these cruises. the 
phytoplankton were examined by Mr. Allen and his

14:53.917 --> 15:14.237
associate, Easter Cup, and Martin Johnson and his 
assistants and students did the work on the

14:53.917 --> 15:14.237
zooplankton. So, yes, and the group was small 
enough that you did sort of see everybody

15:20.073 --> 15:25.198
frequently, and there was a good deal of exchange, 
yes. But it was not a, it didn't by any means involve

15:25.218 --> 15:36.990
all of the activities at Scripps or all the 
faculty.

15:37.010 --> 15:38.692
When does Roger Revell get to Scripps? Well, he 
arrived a month or two after I did in the summer of

15:38.852 --> 15:48.342
1931 and came down to, uh, work on the sediment 
samples that had been collected on the cruise of

15:48.710 --> 16:16.827
the non-magnetic vessel Carnegie during, I think 
it was 1928 and 29, and he was to carry out this

15:48.710 --> 16:16.827
examination

15:48.710 --> 16:16.827
of the material under the direction of Dr. 
Vaughan, but He also got interested in a number of

16:17.144 --> 16:33.728
things, and we worked together on several 
problems, one of them concerning the solubility

16:17.144 --> 16:33.728
of calcium carbonate and the precipitation of 
calcium carbonate in seawater. And he also used to

16:35.190 --> 16:45.565
participate in some of these cruises that we made 
before the sardines Investigations began in

16:45.882 --> 16:47.924
1937. In fact, he and I used to take the research 
vessel out most of the time when I acted as captain

16:48.085 --> 16:58.777
and deckhand. We had only a one-man crew who was the 
engineer on the small vessel that was available.

17:07.907 --> 17:13.293
It's been suggested to me recently that one of the 
problems with the modern oceanographers, they

17:07.907 --> 17:13.293
don't get their feet wet, so to speak. They don't 
spend enough time on vessels. Would you agree with

17:14.875 --> 17:15.636
that? Well, yes and no. I think the

17:18.248 --> 17:42.788
character of the work at sea has changed as the 
vessels have become much larger and as the

17:18.248 --> 17:42.788
equipment has become much more complex, and that 
the vessel we had The Times I'm talking about,

17:43.122 --> 17:49.211
prior to the sardine surveys, was just called the 
Scripps. And she was a 55-foot trawler-type

17:50.532 --> 17:56.200
vessel with a one-man permanent crew. And so the 
graduate students in general used to take out and

17:57.082 --> 18:02.970
run the ship, essentially. navigate as necessary 
do all of the sampling do all of the sort of deckhand

18:03.254 --> 18:30.392
functions and as well as work on the samples after 
they were back in the laboratory now it's more like

18:03.254 --> 18:30.392
I have the feeling as a graduate student goes out 
it's more or less like going on an ocean liner that

18:03.254 --> 18:30.392
they're just in a sense kind of a passenger on a big a 
relatively large vessel, they have very little to

18:31.283 --> 18:50.387
do with the planning or with the navigation, the 
operation of the vessels at sea, and usually don't

18:31.283 --> 18:50.387
know very much about what's going on except the 
specific sort of project they're engaged in. So I

18:50.407 --> 18:59.839
think we've lost something in this process, and 
there's

18:50.407 --> 18:59.839
still some I think activities of the type that I'm 
reminiscing about that are conducted in some

19:00.899 --> 19:12.950
near-shore work at various institutions. But 
still, I find the students have a very sort of

19:12.970 --> 19:21.038
narrow concept of what goes on. There we go. About 
15 seconds here. What do you mean? It pauses now?

19:27.584 --> 19:28.645
Yeah, I've got 15 seconds. delay to make sure we 
don't overtake.

19:37.070 --> 19:50.843
Now, it's also been suggested that with the advent 
of the computer in terms of collecting data and

19:37.070 --> 19:50.843
evaluating it and so forth, particularly 
concerning physical oceanography, that the

19:37.070 --> 19:50.843
physical oceanographer loses touch with what 
he's doing. Would you agree with that? Well, I

19:52.504 --> 19:54.006
certainly would. And that's one of the things that 
has bothered me a good deal. in recent years is the

19:59.658 --> 20:25.041
capability to take more data and to use a computer 
for various processing, routine processing,

19:59.658 --> 20:25.041
compilation, manipulation, compilation 
analysis, plotting, and so on.

20:25.882 --> 20:34.815
Younger scientists don't have the kind of 
familiarity with the specific information that I

20:25.882 --> 20:34.815
think we had in years gone by. I think I can say with 
some confidence that I used to know every

20:34.835 --> 20:46.351
observation that had ever been made in most of the 
Pacific Ocean. And there weren't very many, but I

20:46.651 --> 20:53.661
knew every one and could

20:54.198 --> 20:57.261
I knew whether it was good or bad. I knew how it was 
related to other observations and so on. And this

21:01.024 --> 21:10.793
kind of an intimacy is certainly being lost today, 
where students may not even see the set of original

21:01.024 --> 21:10.793
data in any form. Times have changed, and I'm 
harking back to a condition that will probably

21:12.254 --> 21:23.344
never prevail again. I think something has been 
lost here.

21:29.320 --> 21:37.308
Now, when you began to plan your voyages, let's say 
around 37 or 38, I'm interested in how you made your

21:29.320 --> 21:37.308
decisions, where to go, what to do. Was it pretty 
well dictated by the fisheries itself, or were you

21:37.688 --> 21:43.214
pretty free to do what you wanted to do? No, I would 
say that we were fairly free.

21:52.113 --> 22:19.960
talking only in terms of really one more or less 
specific evaporation, but within a rather

21:52.113 --> 22:19.960
general frame of reference, why we were allowed to 
plan our own program, and of course it was

21:52.113 --> 22:19.960
discussed with Alton Setty and Lionel Offord and 
others that were involved, But in general, I think

22:20.564 --> 22:28.211
we decided what should be done and how it should be 
done, where, when, and so on. And that there

22:28.231 --> 22:38.941
was a considerable freedom in choice here in what 
we did. The other thing we were able to do at that

22:38.981 --> 22:50.031
time was to work out fairly sort of comprehensive 
programs as far as types of information gathered

22:38.981 --> 22:50.031
and so on. It was certainly a case always of trying 
to optimize what we could do because we had very

22:51.040 --> 23:01.473
limited resources in terms of money and people and 
equipment. So we had to select fairly carefully

23:01.553 --> 23:07.360
what we felt we could do. I have to remember that 
most of this was even before the days of the old

23:08.161 --> 23:15.009
mechanical bathy thermograph, the BT. In fact, we 
had the experience of working with I think it was BT

23:19.947 --> 23:39.880
number 5, which was sent to us in the spring of 1941 
by Woods Hole when nobody even knew whether the

23:19.947 --> 23:39.880
instrument would function properly and had no 
kind of experience with the kind of information

23:19.947 --> 23:39.880
you could get with a device of that kind.

23:42.391 --> 23:46.296
When you were at Scripps in this period, was there 
much contact with international oceanography?

23:46.817 --> 23:49.160
Did you have any international oceanographers 
come through? Yes, we used to have quite a few

23:49.601 --> 24:08.145
visitors, at least relatively speaking, in that 
Professor Vaughn, who was the director from,

23:49.601 --> 24:08.145
actually I think it was from 1924 until 1936, had 
been relatively active in sort of international

24:08.800 --> 24:27.214
ocean matters and had a number of friends and 
professional friends in foreign countries,

24:08.800 --> 24:27.214
Japan and Europe and so on, and we were one of the 
relatively few places that anyone interested in

24:27.920 --> 24:37.492
the ocean would come to visit in the United States. 
What I'm trying to say is there weren't very many

24:37.552 --> 24:40.475
places to visit. So we saw a good many of the

24:41.136 --> 24:52.510
distinguished people from other areas, and then 
when Professor Sverdrup came in, he had a very

24:52.810 --> 25:02.304
close bonds with many, many people in different 
fields and different countries, and this sort of

24:52.810 --> 25:02.304
continued in a way.

25:05.389 --> 25:17.367
I can remember in particular, we had one or more 
visits from Helund Hansen, a Norwegian

25:05.389 --> 25:17.367
oceanographer.

25:18.410 --> 25:25.740
So we had reasonably good, I feel, in some ways, 
maybe better contacts than we have today. Now,

25:26.721 --> 25:33.290
when you're involved in this in the 30s, was there 
sort of a sense of excitement about moving out

25:26.721 --> 25:33.290
towards a new frontier? No, I don't think so. It was 
all good fun, but we didn't see any great manifest

25:36.013 --> 25:43.523
destiny or anything for it. We didn't think in 
terms of national ocean policy and so on. We just

25:48.988 --> 25:52.492
thought there were interesting scientific 
problems to be solved. And as I look back on it now,

25:53.372 --> 26:12.632
that period really before the war at Scripps, we 
were very much in sort of ivory tower, although as

25:53.372 --> 26:12.632
I've already indicated, we were beginning to move 
into what might be called applied oceanography as

25:53.372 --> 26:12.632
it was related to some of these fisheries 
problems. But ordinarily, though, this is still

26:13.304 --> 26:20.118
primarily research for its own sake rather than 
sort of the applied research that comes out

26:13.304 --> 26:20.118
between 41 and 45? Oh,

26:20.278 --> 26:23.645
yes. The funding of the of the institution at that 
time, Scripps Institution, was basically all

26:27.175 --> 26:56.895
through the University of California, since the 
state funds reaching us through the university,

26:27.175 --> 26:56.895
except that in connection with the sardine 
investigations, the federal

26:27.175 --> 26:56.895
fisheries agency did provide money to help 
operate the vessel, which was the E.W. Scripps at

27:04.304 --> 27:06.667
that time. This is after the bluefin. We're 
getting in a number of omissions and so on, and

27:08.750 --> 27:17.702
trying to trace the history of these things. But we 
were all We did not consider, as one would probably

27:21.496 --> 27:29.505
do now, that we were dependent on federal funding 
to function. We were essentially supported

27:29.525 --> 27:39.297
through the academic funds from the University of 
California.

27:40.078 --> 27:48.027
There was also support from some of the members of 
the Scripps family, which was available at that

27:40.078 --> 27:48.027
time. There has also been discussion that perhaps 
the nature of oceanography has changed for the

27:49.238 --> 27:57.968
worse, and that they have lost sort of a jack of all 
trades approach. Would you agree with that? Well,

27:59.309 --> 28:04.195
this is, I think, where personal prejudices come 
in. And I would agree that I feel that one of the

28:04.255 --> 28:15.668
things that attracted me to the field originally 
was the fact that we were able to deal with a what I

28:16.255 --> 28:38.348
consider is essentially a sort of a unified 
system, and where we could cross the disciplinary

28:16.255 --> 28:38.348
boundaries, which we did very freely at that time, 
between chemistry, physical aspects, biology,

28:16.255 --> 28:38.348
geology, without anybody raising an eyebrow. And 
we did try and deal with the systems in a... well as

28:43.103 --> 28:47.690
we could as essentially unified systems. And I 
think today it's become fragmented again by

28:47.710 --> 29:08.301
specialization, which is partly, I think, the 
result of the interests of the scientists who come

28:47.710 --> 29:08.301
into the field, but it's also being encouraged in a 
sense by the way in which the federal funding has

29:08.939 --> 29:17.591
become more and more specialized and fragmented. 
And I don't consider this desirable at all. Most of

29:24.041 --> 29:31.892
my efforts in recent years have been to try and 
bring the subject matter back together again as

29:24.041 --> 29:31.892
much as I can.
