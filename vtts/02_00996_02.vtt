WEBVTT

00:05.633 --> 00:10.841
The people in the boondocks, they didn't know what 
to believe. The VC come in, if they don't do what

00:11.362 --> 00:15.888
they tell them, they'll destroy everything. We 
come in, we destroy everything. The civilian

00:19.894 --> 00:25.663
population didn't know what to think.

00:25.723 --> 00:27.065
Did you know much about the enemy? Did you come in 
contact? no the only enemy we came in contact with

00:30.625 --> 00:59.282
was after after a battle maybe we did very rarely do 
we wind up with any prisoners so we didn't get

00:30.625 --> 00:59.282
first-hand knowledge of the enemy except they 
were good and the fact that they set up an ambush

00:30.625 --> 00:59.282
where they wake you right on top of them before they 
open fire but it never really met you face to face

00:30.625 --> 00:59.282
usually at a distance The brush is so thick you 
can't see them. They can see us. Hell, we're six

01:03.473 --> 01:04.514
foot. They're a little parched. They're hugging 
the ground and we're standing straight up. They

01:11.464 --> 01:12.145
see us. We don't see them.

01:16.391 --> 01:20.937
Second time, I went to a PW camp one time, but I 
didn't really talk to the enemy. They were just as

01:20.977 --> 01:24.382
dedicated as we were. In fact, they were probably 
more dedicated. than we were and definitely more

01:27.393 --> 01:33.660
dedicated than New Orleans.

01:33.680 --> 01:43.210
Did you find any problems with leadership, drugs, 
or what's known as fragging? Not in my youth. We did

01:46.273 --> 01:50.758
not have any trouble of any kind. In fact, my troops 
wouldn't know what drugs were and where would they

01:56.806 --> 01:59.830
have gotten it? We were never in the cities. We were 
strictly in the dugouts. Now, I'm sure that the

02:06.278 --> 02:14.949
troops in Saigon and Vung Tau and Cam Ranh Bay and 
all those large places probably had it. Just like

02:15.770 --> 02:23.540
that movie Apocalypse Now, I thought that was one 
of the biggest disgraces of the so-called

02:15.770 --> 02:23.540
depiction of Vietnam. If the troops were like 
that, In a combat situation, they wouldn't

02:25.983 --> 02:28.346
survive.

02:31.769 --> 02:36.014
I understand later in the 70s there was a lot of drug 
use over there. I wasn't there in the 70s. But from

02:39.918 --> 02:52.311
my experience, if you have good leadership, the 
troops respect the leader, they're not going to

02:39.918 --> 02:52.311
get involved in that stuff because, hey, they want 
to go home. They're not going to go home if they're

02:53.067 --> 02:56.652
stoning on a combat operation. That's just 
inviting disaster. As far as leadership goes,

03:01.037 --> 03:15.776
well,

03:01.037 --> 03:15.776
in the officer ranks in our division, an officer 
spent six months in the field and then he'd be taken

03:01.037 --> 03:15.776
to the rear and put in a staff position someplace. 
An enlisted man, he's committed to the boondocks

03:20.624 --> 03:24.128
from the day he got there until the day he leaves. So 
your

03:26.190 --> 03:37.982
average enlisted man and the noncommissioned 
officer, they're the ones that are constantly in

03:26.190 --> 03:37.982
each other's contact. And to my knowledge, in our 
unit, with a very few exceptions, the troops had

03:39.443 --> 03:50.074
complete faith in their noncommissioned 
officer. They can care less about an officer. In

03:53.963 --> 04:09.066
fact, sometimes I believe the only reason some of 
these characters become officers is they know

03:53.963 --> 04:09.066
they can't make it as an enlisted

03:53.963 --> 04:09.066
man. What did you think about careerism, people 
trying to get ahead by falsifying body counts? I

04:18.860 --> 04:21.623
have no use for that stuff. I mean, if you can find a 
body, fine, you found it. But don't say there's ten

04:28.071 --> 04:32.796
when you don't find one. Don't falsify any 
reports, be honest. I mean, it's the same thing

04:35.219 --> 04:46.352
as... You don't need to falsify any kind of 
information to get advantage. To get advanced,

04:47.007 --> 04:52.012
all you got to do is do your job to the best of your 
ability. You don't have to falsify or fake

04:53.053 --> 04:56.897
anything. In fact, I think I'm, I hope I'm a good 
example of that. I wound up one of the youngest

05:01.983 --> 05:07.508
first sergeants that I ever heard of in the United 
States Army. In fact, the average person doesn't

05:09.190 --> 05:13.875
make first sergeant until after he's been 18 
years. I only had something like 12 when I became a

05:14.716 --> 05:20.102
first sergeant. And in fact, that turned the 
sergeant major down so that I could retire,

05:20.142 --> 05:26.248
because if I'd accepted what I'd had, it would stay 
two more years. But after I finally made staff

05:27.609 --> 05:34.657
sergeant, nine months later I became a sergeant in 
first class. A year, year and a half later, I became

05:35.798 --> 05:40.062
a first sergeant. I just, to me at the time, I 
thought I was in the right place at the right time.

05:45.547 --> 05:48.851
But I had a couple commanders told me otherwise.

05:51.874 --> 05:52.494
But we won't rule you that way. Do you think the 
methods we used to measure the war were

05:52.514 --> 06:00.883
sufficient? No. I don't think anything used to 
measure what took place in Vietnam is even

06:01.164 --> 06:13.697
remotely accurate. Vietnam was a political 
fiasco.

06:21.648 --> 06:25.693
Soldiers don't declare war. Soldiers don't start 
war. Soldiers are only there to fight war. The

06:32.300 --> 06:35.864
politicians are the ones who make decisions. We 
couldn't do anything in Vietnam without some

06:37.366 --> 06:42.672
clown in Washington, D.C., telling us to do it. It 
was just a political expediency. One, I think it

06:51.174 --> 06:57.942
was a testing ground for some of our new weapons, 
what used to be called Cochrane. At the time,

06:58.963 --> 07:02.307
Cochrane was classified. But half the weapons we 
used in Vietnam were relatively new. Never been

07:06.412 --> 07:07.653
tried before. Never tried in Vietnam.

07:14.157 --> 07:18.583
I didn't volunteer to go to Vietnam.

07:22.268 --> 07:22.828
But I went. Because I was sick. I thought I went 
there to fight a war.

07:30.238 --> 07:36.787
And our political ideology is right. We're trying 
to contain communism. But we didn't contain any

07:41.513 --> 07:43.135
communism. All we did was destroy. It wasn't like 
World War II. Everything about World War II was

07:49.150 --> 07:52.134
well defined. On top of that, our philosophy is not 
to conquer.

07:59.265 --> 08:04.653
We want to win, but then when we win, we don't 
exploit. We rebuild. And as a result, Germany and

08:07.337 --> 08:11.383
Japan are two of the greatest industrial nations 
in the world today because we helped rebuild after

08:12.005 --> 08:22.355
we defeated them. Vietnam, we abandoned them. In 
fact, we abandoned them right after World War II.

08:31.643 --> 08:40.071
During World War II, Ho Chi Minh fought with the 
American OSS. against the Japanese. And because

08:44.373 --> 08:51.603
of World War II, the French government had to 
abandon Vietnam. Vietnam was a colony of France.

08:56.670 --> 09:00.976
And that colonialism was interrupted briefly 
during World War II. And after the war,

09:03.419 --> 09:10.969
the Allies abandoned Vietnam Ho Chi Minh asked for 
our assistance to prevent the French from coming

09:13.042 --> 09:22.356
back and establishing colonialism again. We 
didn't even respond to his request. We just flat

09:26.902 --> 09:28.364
ignored him. And the French come back again with 
their arrogance and everything and recolonizes

09:29.967 --> 09:41.243
the Vietnamese people and Ho Chi Minh Well, his 
name wasn't Wu Chi Minh, really, but that's what he

09:42.185 --> 09:45.550
became. And he was constantly asking for 
assistance. We want to be a free and independent

09:49.656 --> 09:52.300
country. We don't want to be a lackey of France, 
this and that. And the British, they're just

09:59.871 --> 10:01.794
exploiting us. They're taking all the resources 
out, treating the people like slaves. So... the

10:11.733 --> 10:20.006
Viet Minh's predator, fighting against

10:11.733 --> 10:20.006
France. And, of course, Ho Chi Minh was the 
principal leader of the Viet Minh, where the name

10:20.026 --> 10:25.635
Minh comes from.

10:29.481 --> 10:30.783
Now, they were doing pretty good. In fact, just 
before D&D and Pew, when they quit France, France

10:31.784 --> 10:40.137
asked for our assistance to help them out. And we 
refused, so France kicked us, our military

10:40.876 --> 10:45.762
forces, out of France. They stayed in NATO, but 
they kicked us out of France. We had a pretty bad

10:50.847 --> 10:53.510
relationship with France. But we didn't go in and 
help the French against the Vietnamese. We didn't

10:58.176 --> 11:02.260
help the Vietnamese against the French, although 
we were there. We'd been there ever since World War

11:03.402 --> 11:05.344
II. The average person doesn't know that. And then 
all of a sudden, after Vietnam, after the Indian

11:11.217 --> 11:18.805
Peel in 1954, then there was already a North and 
South Vietnam. And then the South Vietnamese

11:18.825 --> 11:25.311
asked for assistance against the North 
Vietnamese. And we had a treaty with them, and so we

11:25.331 --> 11:35.281
assist the South Vietnamese against the North 
Vietnamese. Here we're fighting an old ally who,

11:35.301 --> 11:40.887
if The politicians that paid attention during 
World War II, there would not have been such a thing

11:42.048 --> 11:47.613
as North and South Vietnam. There would not have 
been communism in Vietnam. It would have been a

11:50.796 --> 11:53.318
democracy. But since we would not assist the 
Vietnamese back in 46, 47 later, they went to the

11:53.338 --> 12:06.410
communists for assistance. And that's why you 
have communist regime in Vietnam.

12:14.752 --> 12:21.880
What did you think about what was going on back home 
with demonstrations and the National Guard?

12:21.900 --> 12:26.185
Well, I don't care for all the demonstrations and 
whatnot. In fact, the people in the United States

12:26.285 --> 12:35.215
didn't really know what was going on in Vietnam 
except what they saw on TV. And TV news and Vietnam

12:35.235 --> 12:41.401
was the first war ever broadcast on TV. But it's 
one-sided. And journalists,

12:44.536 --> 12:51.344
their function is to sell a story. They don't go out 
and get a really true depiction of what's going on.

13:00.416 --> 13:05.702
Now, what they showed on TV was factual, but it was 
the presentation. They twist things around. CBS

13:07.845 --> 13:09.627
in particular is good for that.

13:12.571 --> 13:14.273
But that's one thing about being an American. If 
you don't agree, you have the right to get up and say

13:15.113 --> 13:18.819
something. And that's one reason why I spent my 
life in the military. To protect that freedom.

13:25.789 --> 13:30.396
People are free to voice their opinion. As long as 
their opinion doesn't hurt somebody else. And

13:35.644 --> 13:37.226
they can demonstrate all they want. They can 
holler at me and say anything they want. But I know

13:43.415 --> 13:44.597
what I did. They don't know what I did. They just 
think they

13:47.359 --> 13:51.245
know. People coming back from World War II, Korea, 
they came back as heroes. People coming back from

13:54.670 --> 13:58.815
Vietnam, they just spit at you. But that just won't 
show ignorance. They think that we're there

14:00.758 --> 14:08.569
killing little babies, and I'm sure we did for the 
most part. But most of that is accidental.

14:13.856 --> 14:15.158
I mean, you can't control mass bombing, or mass 
artillery strike. You know there's an enemy

14:19.766 --> 14:27.917
there, but those enemies are also going to have 
other people around them. So we try not to conduct

14:27.997 --> 14:35.327
atrocities.

14:35.347 --> 14:36.910
The National Guard's a good organization. In 
fact, half the people in the National Guard are

14:37.210 --> 14:41.716
ex-military personnel, active duty. And they've 
proven themselves in many wars.

14:52.111 --> 14:53.833
How about selective service?

14:57.218 --> 14:59.220
The draft? I think the draft is necessary.

15:03.846 --> 15:08.132
There shouldn't be a volunteer military force. 
Everybody should devote a little bit of time. Two

15:12.698 --> 15:14.921
years for the draft is sufficient. Chances of a 
person having to go to combat are relatively slim.

15:22.722 --> 15:26.907
Military experience is good for anybody. But one 
of these days, and I doubt if it's all that far away,

15:28.028 --> 15:35.015
there's going to be a war on American soil. 
Somebody is going to try to take over the United

15:35.836 --> 15:41.082
States. And fortunately, I don't believe they'll 
ever win.

15:47.649 --> 15:50.552
The private citizen in the United States has too 
many weapons. to let some foreign power come in

15:51.595 --> 15:56.301
here and overtake us. And we're about the only 
country in the world where the private citizen can

15:56.321 --> 16:03.230
have weapons. Europeans, Asians, it's still 
legal for them to have anything more than a

16:04.752 --> 16:13.463
12-gauge shotgun.

16:13.483 --> 16:19.611
But Americans are well armed and we intend to keep 
our freedom

16:22.493 --> 16:23.394
one of these days. We've been lucky. There's never 
been a war fought on our soil since the American

16:24.435 --> 16:31.282
Civil War, fortunately. But with today's 
weaponry, we can fire it on from hundreds of miles

16:33.083 --> 16:52.382
away, and all they need to do is a couple of 
well-placed rounds, missiles so to speak, in

16:33.083 --> 16:52.382
certain areas, and they can come in with air 
assault or amphibious and go to town. They could

16:58.591 --> 17:02.676
cripple us in one day before we could respond.

17:05.258 --> 17:15.329
Because everything we have is centrally located 
pretty much and it's spread out but it's all, for

17:05.258 --> 17:15.329
example, you take Houston. One missile in 
Pasadena would wipe out Harris County in several

17:23.581 --> 17:52.153
surrounding counties just from one round 
everything will be spontaneous

17:23.581 --> 17:52.153
all of our military bases san antonio has 
something like four air force bases and an army

17:23.581 --> 17:52.153
base all within a small area everything in the 
united states is well documented well publicized

17:23.581 --> 17:52.153
our potential enemy is russia

17:23.581 --> 17:52.153
they have all the order of battle they need about us 
They can pick up any newspaper, how their

17:52.302 --> 17:56.828
satellites fly around, whatnot. They know where 
our key areas are. And I'm sure they have a missile

18:01.094 --> 18:06.561
aimed at that particular location. They even know 
where our missile silos are. It's supposed to be

18:08.523 --> 18:09.905
top secret. But we don't know where 
three-quarters of their stuff is. They're

18:14.952 --> 18:16.674
secretive. We're too open-minded.

18:21.597 --> 18:28.145
However, nobody is ever going to conquer the 
United States.

18:28.165 --> 18:29.166
It would be impossible. They might inflict a hell 
of a lot of casualties, but then all of a sudden we'd

18:30.127 --> 18:41.581
be just like the partisans in Czechoslovakia and 
Yugoslavia during World War II. In all your

18:41.601 --> 18:51.132
movies, they always depict the French partisans, 
but the French were secondary compared to the

18:41.601 --> 18:51.132
Yugoslavs. and the Czechoslovakians. They were 
the true fighters of World War

18:54.368 --> 18:59.555
II. How could we have won the war? Who do you think is 
responsible for our holy hell? And should we have

19:05.041 --> 19:10.148
even been

19:05.041 --> 19:10.148
there to begin with? First, I don't think we should 
have been there unless we went in right after World

19:10.168 --> 19:15.394
War II. If we had gone in right after World War II, we 
could have set up a sovereign government just like

19:22.600 --> 19:25.363
we did with Germany and Japan. We were there and 
done with old French, Britain, and the United

19:26.184 --> 19:30.710
States and Germany. And then in 1955, we returned 
sovereignty to the German people. We did it before

19:38.078 --> 19:41.022
that in Japan. We could have done it for Vietnam. 
But our politicians sent us there. So there we

19:48.691 --> 19:50.413
were. If the politicians had kept their nose out of 
it, if they were going to commit us to fight a war,

19:53.110 --> 20:01.981
they should have let us fight it. The way we know 
it's supposed to be. We could have started at one

20:03.863 --> 20:10.571
end of that country and swept on through and there 
wouldn't have been anything there. Except

20:12.353 --> 20:13.755
Reynolds. We could have driven the unfriendlies 
out. No doubt about it. We had the manpower. We had

20:21.564 --> 20:22.425
the weapons. And we have the know-how. But the 
politicians were the idiots fighting the war. But

20:31.397 --> 20:33.880
they're fighting it several thousand miles away. 
Now, if the politicians are going to commit us to a

20:35.142 --> 20:44.195
war, we ought to put the politicians in there and 
let them fight it and see how long it goes. There

20:45.617 --> 20:48.040
probably wouldn't be one to start with. But 
they're safe and sound back in Washington, D.C.,

20:48.060 --> 20:50.944
or Well, when they do go to a combat zone, they don't 
get out of Saigon or Cam Ranh Bay. They don't get to

20:57.515 --> 21:04.063
places like Don Tan and Mito and Van Head, 
Klajurang. They stay back there where it's

21:04.684 --> 21:07.267
relatively safe. Politicians are exponents of 
freedom. We did not lose the war. We were not

21:14.156 --> 21:16.640
allowed to fight the war. And then as a result, 
because of the casualties mounting up, The

21:20.894 --> 21:28.321
sentiment back home, they come up with some ploy 
and they withdraw. Well, since they did it that

21:29.101 --> 21:36.448
way, why did they put us there in the first

21:29.101 --> 21:36.448
place? How do you feel about Vietnam and the 
conflict today? Is it any different from before? I

21:43.835 --> 21:50.901
wish we had been able to establish a sovereign 
nation. if the North wanted to stay communist,

21:51.708 --> 21:54.290
fine. But I can't really see any one nation trying 
to inflict its view, its policy, or anything, on

21:55.532 --> 22:07.563
another nation. And we're very bad about that. We 
try to, we think we're the only, we're the king of

22:09.385 --> 22:18.053
the crop, and we try to inflict our view on 
everybody else.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.983
Vietnamese people, there's nothing wrong with 
the people. They just want to live in a world of

22:24.143 --> 22:27.288
peace. Right now, they're still not in peace. The 
communists come in and put their indoctrination

22:30.853 --> 22:40.626
in on everything, and those that had something in 
the past, they don't have any spot now. And the ones

22:40.666 --> 22:45.372
that didn't have anything in the past, they have 
even less now. The poorer get poorer. Same with The

22:51.496 --> 22:57.925
Vietnamese people were abandoned after we told 
them we were going to help them. And any of those

22:57.945 --> 23:05.897
people that did assist us, when the Communists 
came in, they were annihilated. That's why you

23:05.917 --> 23:10.924
have so many refugees now, so-called boat people, 
trying to get away. That tells the world about

23:12.066 --> 23:15.912
Communism. Even in Europe today, the Berlin Wall. 
The Berlin Wall still can't keep everybody in. Why

23:21.370 --> 23:23.255
build a wall to keep people in? Walls are supposed 
to keep people out.

23:29.413 --> 23:29.854
That's all. Thank you very much for allowing me to 
interview you. You're welcome.
