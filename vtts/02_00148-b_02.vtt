WEBVTT

00:02.815 --> 00:03.936
Calhoun?

00:05.037 --> 00:10.023
Well, I heard a lot of good things about Calhoun, but he was an engineer, so we didn't really interact very much.

00:10.103 --> 00:13.546
But everything I heard about him was very good.

00:14.347 --> 00:18.391
And I guess, you know, you can tell me about this, I guess.

00:19.152 --> 00:26.119
He was supposed to be the next president, and they got Miller instead, who was a disaster.

00:29.123 --> 00:31.405
Of all the presidents,

00:31.942 --> 00:38.249
that you have observed in your Texas A&M years, to which ones would you give the highest marks?

00:40.752 --> 00:50.643
Well, I don't think there's any doubt about what Rudder had the biggest influence on Texas A&M because of the Corps of Cadets and the women.

00:51.684 --> 00:55.048
But I would just look around the campus and see the buildings.

00:55.068 --> 00:58.472
A lot of them went up when Rudder was here.

00:59.482 --> 01:02.226
He was remarkable from his background.

01:02.246 --> 01:08.395
I guess it was the idea that in the Army, intelligence is important.

01:08.815 --> 01:12.681
And he talked to the right people and listened to the right people.

01:13.622 --> 01:19.611
And like I say, in Washington, that was one of the comments I heard about Miller.

01:20.252 --> 01:21.814
People in Washington said, who's he?

01:24.378 --> 01:25.860
Nobody.

01:26.330 --> 01:30.336
Rudder wasn't a scientist or anything, but he was known in Washington.

01:31.257 --> 01:34.882
Anybody else you'd give high marks to?

01:35.784 --> 01:42.373
Well, I give Williams high marks for taking care of Suttle.

01:42.393 --> 01:44.677
Also, there was a downside to Rudder.

01:44.977 --> 01:50.726
As I said, intelligence was important, and I think he had his spies around the campus.

01:51.567 --> 01:55.813
And somehow with Williams, some of that disappeared.

01:56.367 --> 02:00.150
As far, I'll give you one example of the Christian organizations.

02:00.270 --> 02:08.618
I was an advisor for InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, and Dean Hannigan was in charge of that kind of thing.

02:09.559 --> 02:16.244
And under Rudder and Hannigan, everything was, nothing was in writing, everything was understanding.

02:16.264 --> 02:21.469
Nobody could, nobody could ever find a paper trail.

02:22.470 --> 02:23.591
And everything worked fine.

02:23.671 --> 02:26.053
I mean, they had nothing against, but with Williams,

02:26.573 --> 02:30.520
He said, well, I'm worried about conflict of church and state.

02:31.381 --> 02:42.501
So I don't remember whether he told InterVarsity they couldn't meet or he said, I'm going to check with the attorney general and find out.

02:43.382 --> 02:47.890
So he asked the attorney general if a group like InterVarsity could meet.

02:48.224 --> 02:55.918
on the campus, and it wasn't just in the faith student center there, it was anywhere.

02:56.800 --> 03:03.472
And the Attorney General came back with a very good statement, I thought, and he went back to the United States First Amendment.

03:03.592 --> 03:09.743
He said there can be no discrimination against church and

03:10.195 --> 03:15.443
If you have an airplane club or a chess club or whatever, well, you can't say there can't be a religious club.

03:16.825 --> 03:20.611
And Williams respected that, and from then on there was no trouble.

03:21.613 --> 03:31.668
So maybe that was just an indication of kind of getting things in a formal setting, whereas Rudder did things informally.

03:34.332 --> 03:35.494
Well, I think he...

03:36.149 --> 03:39.713
Well, maybe it was Andy Suttle who had the spies with the cyclotron.

03:39.733 --> 03:42.116
I don't know, but I think there were people reporting to him.

03:42.937 --> 03:48.142
You know, we'd say something at a faculty meeting, and I was told that the secretary there would then tell us.

03:48.883 --> 03:55.190
We assumed it was all confidential, and the secretary would tell somebody everything that was said.

03:56.191 --> 04:01.417
Well, I think under Williams, that was eliminated, that kind of thing.

04:01.998 --> 04:04.080
During these...

04:05.714 --> 04:09.879
now would be 39 years of observing A&M.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.204
Do you think A&M has made real academic progress?

04:16.408 --> 04:17.129
Is this a?

04:17.249 --> 04:17.750
Oh, yeah.

04:18.150 --> 04:19.832
No, I have no question about that.

04:21.134 --> 04:22.816
And in physics, we're a major leaguer.

04:24.358 --> 04:24.659
Yeah.

04:25.019 --> 04:30.386
We're still not in the class with a football team, number 10 or anything.

04:30.406 --> 04:32.008
But, yeah.

04:33.473 --> 04:41.684
We've kind of tailed off because we had so many people who were hired at the same time, and now they're all 60 to 65, and now we're beginning to hire people again.

04:42.886 --> 04:49.415
So I don't think there's been too much advance in the last 10 years.

04:49.575 --> 04:54.823
We made a big jump when they had the super collider, and suddenly a lot of money came in, and we got some very good people.

04:56.204 --> 04:59.249
But I don't see any reason why we shouldn't get some good people again.

04:59.689 --> 05:01.692
As you look over these years,

05:02.296 --> 05:07.701
Now, with the clarity of hindsight, are there some opportunities that A&M missed?

05:09.503 --> 05:12.245
Are there some things that we could have done that we didn't?

05:17.190 --> 05:19.351
No, I don't think of anything offhand.

05:19.472 --> 05:20.593
I don't either.

05:20.613 --> 05:23.395
I think it's a tough business.

05:24.036 --> 05:26.518
It's like Slocum has his problems.

05:26.538 --> 05:30.141
There's some good teams out there.

05:30.161 --> 05:32.083
And it's tough to move up in the rankings.

05:32.367 --> 05:34.250
I think we're doing the right things.

05:35.011 --> 05:36.554
Well, these are things I don't know about.

05:36.574 --> 05:43.685
I think they get quite a bit of money when they hire a new person, hundreds of thousands of dollars to set him up in a laboratory and so on.

05:43.765 --> 05:51.597
And so as far as I know, I guess they'd like to have some more chairs.

05:51.657 --> 05:52.879
They're talking about that.

05:52.899 --> 05:56.125
I was over at the business school in Austin.

05:56.205 --> 06:00.231
I don't know, 40 different chairs they have on the wall over there.

06:01.358 --> 06:03.401
We don't have any chairs in physics.

06:03.461 --> 06:06.164
I don't know how many they have over there in physics, probably not like that.

06:06.245 --> 06:14.696
But anyway, that kind of thing I think we've kind of overlooked, because there are a lot of rich people, a lot of rich Aggies around.

06:15.577 --> 06:25.811
In terms of support facilities, are technology on the campus is capable for a good physics department?

06:26.992 --> 06:28.294
Yeah, I guess the main thing,

06:29.000 --> 06:35.691
one would think about is the computer, and I'm not a theoretician, so I don't use the computer that much.

06:36.192 --> 06:44.566
I've been surprised how good the library is here, and that's because of my interest in Adam and Eve and Calvin and so on.

06:45.067 --> 06:48.793
And the other thing is, yeah, I should mention this.

06:48.913 --> 06:51.177
This interlibrary loan is fantastic.

06:51.950 --> 07:00.603
I've gotten books from 1893 out of Princeton in 1911, Princeton Theological Review, and here they are in a couple days.

07:01.044 --> 07:03.788
So keep that going.

07:03.828 --> 07:09.397
That's a wonderful facility we have.

07:10.378 --> 07:18.210
All right, these next questions have to do, you are hereby appointed as an advisor, counselor, consultant.

07:18.916 --> 07:28.906
What advice would you give to the physics department today about its future, to do or not to do, and or not to do?

07:31.148 --> 07:35.752
Well, one thing they're talking about, I agree with very much, they're talking about an exploratorium.

07:35.812 --> 07:37.374
I don't know whether you've heard about that or not.

07:38.615 --> 07:44.721
They have an exploratorium in San Francisco that people from Berkeley started, and it's a,

07:45.342 --> 07:46.223
wonderful place.

07:46.243 --> 07:56.959
You go in and you can run all these machines and the laws of physics are all, you throw a ball up in the air and watch it come down and a whole lot of nice things.

07:57.059 --> 08:11.499
And I remember going to one in Chicago when I was only 20 years old, and that's one reason I went to physics probably, just because it's such, well, physics is always good at these open houses and things.

08:11.519 --> 08:13.442
You have people on rotating

08:14.013 --> 08:18.709
stools and they put the dumbbells out and they slow down, they pull them in, they speed up.

08:18.729 --> 08:21.198
Well, the Exploratorium would be like that.

08:21.238 --> 08:24.529
Well, they're talking about having it over there next to McDonald's.

08:25.336 --> 08:29.721
I guess there's a lot of little, except for the bank there, there's not much over there.

08:30.662 --> 08:35.167
And they're trying to get some alumni to support that.

08:35.187 --> 08:36.589
This would be an A&M facility.

08:36.689 --> 08:38.571
It would be an A&M facility, yeah.

08:38.591 --> 08:41.895
And it would just bring in all kinds of high school kids, of course.

08:42.416 --> 08:50.365
All right, in terms of the academic part of the physics department, are there some things that we ought to do or not do?

08:52.437 --> 09:04.451
We need to get good people and that's, you know, Marlon Scully is a famous guy and he's got very good people, people from Russia and Germany and all over the place.

09:05.453 --> 09:08.396
And that's, to me, the key thing is getting people like that.

09:09.958 --> 09:17.848
And that means money and, well, I guess you should talk to Marlon Scully.

09:17.968 --> 09:19.930
He's given a lot more thought than I have.

09:19.994 --> 09:22.678
Now, what's his task these days, Scully?

09:23.659 --> 09:30.629
Well, I guess if you wanted to bring in a Marlon Scully, you'd want to say, well, there's a couple of appointments you can... No, but what does he do?

09:31.250 --> 09:32.031
What is Scully's?

09:32.352 --> 09:38.561
Oh, he's the first one from A&M that's been elected to the National Academy of Sciences.

09:38.581 --> 09:40.964
And he's in quantum optics.

09:40.984 --> 09:41.224
Here?

09:41.665 --> 09:41.905
Here.

09:43.167 --> 09:48.274
We have some famous people who did their work elsewhere, but he did it here.

09:48.294 --> 09:48.735
And...

09:49.070 --> 09:58.239
All right, what advice would you give then to the campus administrators about physics, science, and or anything else?

09:59.140 --> 10:01.682
You're the consultant now about A&M's future.

10:08.248 --> 10:17.457
Well, the key thing in physics is getting good people, and it may be you need more laboratory space.

10:18.095 --> 10:20.519
We have quite a good machine shop.

10:21.921 --> 10:25.647
If you get good people, they get money, and then they can hire machinists and so on.

10:26.388 --> 10:28.291
So the key thing is getting those good people.

10:28.311 --> 10:29.674
Well, what about for the whole institution?

10:29.694 --> 10:31.276
That's what the Cyclotron did for us.

10:31.296 --> 10:36.885
It allowed us to, because it had a first-class facility, we got first-class people to work there.

10:37.466 --> 10:39.109
Well, what about for the whole institution?

10:40.050 --> 10:41.773
For the university?

10:43.694 --> 10:46.577
Well, I suppose it's the same in history as physics, isn't it?

10:46.737 --> 10:47.458
Get good people.

10:48.298 --> 10:53.043
But are there any things we need to add or close up?

10:56.547 --> 11:01.211
I think being as big a university as it is, it's a pretty pleasant campus.

11:02.572 --> 11:04.554
There's places to eat around the campus now.

11:04.574 --> 11:10.360
There wasn't anything over, there's pi-r squares over there now.

11:12.348 --> 11:19.115
So it's... Okay, now I've just about finished all the questions I had except two or three.

11:19.755 --> 11:22.838
Are there some topics that we should have included that we haven't?

11:25.101 --> 11:27.042
Anything you think of that we didn't mention?

11:29.285 --> 11:31.887
No, you jogged my memory pretty well.

11:33.429 --> 11:38.794
Okay, then one of the last questions.

11:39.280 --> 11:44.630
To what individuals relative to this institution do you feel the most grateful?

11:48.939 --> 12:01.744
Well, certainly Earl Rudder, and it was his vision that got the cyclotron here, and he carried it through and got the thing built.

12:05.605 --> 12:12.315
in general, getting the girls in and getting the Corps voluntary, and those were wonderful things that he was able to do.

12:14.278 --> 12:19.666
Others?

12:20.086 --> 12:22.390
I think we're... To whom you feel grateful?

12:22.830 --> 12:25.735
I don't interact with the dean in science very much anymore.

12:25.795 --> 12:28.018
That's probably...

12:28.471 --> 12:32.497
experience with deans is that any time you go over there, it's a problem.

12:32.557 --> 12:37.043
So if I don't go over there, well, I think it's supposed to be going all right.

12:37.063 --> 12:40.427
Well, the physics department, that's one reason Scully stays.

12:40.488 --> 12:41.970
He says it's a very pleasant place.

12:42.030 --> 12:43.131
People like each other.

12:43.211 --> 12:52.845
And so, but I think everybody's kind of frustrated that we don't have a better department.

12:52.905 --> 12:58.292
And the fact that so many people are retiring, this is the opportunity.

12:59.318 --> 13:05.568
I think the dean has agreed to provide a considerable amount of money now so we can go out and get people.

13:07.551 --> 13:08.413
Okay.

13:09.895 --> 13:12.720
Then, next to last question.

13:13.481 --> 13:18.289
Let's make believe that someone walks up to you and hands you a check for a million dollars.

13:19.012 --> 13:23.278
with one condition, you must pass that on to Texas A&M.

13:24.680 --> 13:32.931
In other words, if you could make a big, meaningful gift to Texas A&M, for what purpose would you want your gift used?

13:37.618 --> 13:41.924
In other words, what would be your favorite A&M?

13:43.306 --> 13:47.972
Well, I think endowing and sharing physics would be as good an idea as any.

13:48.256 --> 13:49.618
Okay.

13:49.638 --> 13:50.819
And in what specialty?

13:50.959 --> 13:52.321
Or would you want to specify?

13:53.442 --> 13:55.565
No, the department, I think, should decide.

13:56.566 --> 14:04.375
We've got about four strong groups, and I guess with a million dollars, I don't know.

14:05.096 --> 14:13.085
You might hire a professor that's in one of those strong groups that would be the new leader or something like that.

14:13.526 --> 14:15.188
I think that department should decide.

14:16.769 --> 14:16.970
All right.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.111
Then the last question.

14:18.378 --> 14:22.484
What feelings do you carry in your heart about Texas A&M?

14:22.804 --> 14:27.991
How do you feel about Texas A&M now?

14:28.011 --> 14:29.353
Well, it's kind of like a family.

14:29.433 --> 14:32.858
I mean, I spend a lot of my life here.

14:32.878 --> 14:34.160
I have good feelings about it.

14:34.841 --> 14:35.582
I don't have any.

14:37.404 --> 14:43.052
I mean, we had some big fights when Suttle was here and Squire was here, and they're all over there in the past now.

14:44.095 --> 14:48.527
I'm not of administration, so maybe they're still going on, I don't know.

14:49.268 --> 14:56.046
But it's an enjoyable department with very nice people.
