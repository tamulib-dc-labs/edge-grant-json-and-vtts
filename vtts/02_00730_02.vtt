WEBVTT

00:01.634 --> 00:03.859
an unfortunate personality. You've met people 
like that. They just couldn't seem to get along

00:05.683 --> 00:08.790
with anybody. And the last month or two of school, 
we'd just, somebody every night would drown that

00:09.472 --> 00:15.465
old boy out. And it was downright shameful. And 
I've... I've been ashamed all my life of doing it,

00:20.078 --> 00:24.965
but at the time it was an awful lot of fun. It's a 
great deal more fun to bedevil somebody when you

00:24.985 --> 00:29.591
get an adverse reaction. That's right. If you just 
take it in stride, it's not really a great deal of

00:30.553 --> 00:32.936
fun. That's right, and normally most of the people 
would get drowned out once a year or once or twice in

00:33.036 --> 00:45.934
the spring, and they'd take it good naturally and 
say, okay, we're going to get tomorrow night, and

00:33.036 --> 00:45.934
they'd leave him alone. But that type of a person, 
everybody would concentrate on him. And it was, I

00:50.870 --> 00:59.468
don't know why he didn't get webbed feet as much as 
he was drafted out. But there wasn't as much of

01:00.292 --> 01:01.755
that. Now there was a little of it over in the 
non-military. Somebody that you didn't like and

01:04.620 --> 01:09.169
you wanted to mess them up. Well, there's nothing 
much worse than a big bucket of water and a cot and a

01:09.189 --> 01:16.243
bed and a mattress because there ain't no going 
back to bed. The rest of the night you sit up and it's

01:17.145 --> 01:23.076
a lot of fun. and it's it's we got to where this old 
boy we drowned out we go in and wake him up and just

01:23.663 --> 01:48.642
he's set up we let him have it oh lord lord what kids 
won't do there's not in the book what was the food

01:23.663 --> 01:48.642
like in the mess hall i thought it was delightful i 
never did have a complaint about the food a lot of

01:23.663 --> 01:48.642
kids a lot of men boys complained about it. They 
said it wasn't any good, it was dirty, and the truth

01:51.078 --> 02:07.602
of the matter, the food was delicious, it was 
nutritious, and there wasn't a boy that ever went

01:51.078 --> 02:07.602
to A&M College that didn't grow fat and husky and 
healthy on the food. But as you could understand,

02:08.503 --> 02:17.216
preparing it in the quantities they did, 
certainly it didn't have the touch that Mama did at

02:08.503 --> 02:17.216
home. And naturally, there'd be some bitching 
about it, griping about it, but I never did feel

02:20.532 --> 02:26.282
that way about the food. In fact, I ate better at A&M 
than I had all my life because I ate well at home, but

02:26.342 --> 02:35.198
I worked like the devil, too. I mean, in the field, 
hard, and so I had no complaint about the food. I

02:40.748 --> 02:41.469
thought it was wonderful. Was there much variety, 
or did you have Oh, I thought we had a lot of variety.

02:46.215 --> 02:49.138
Now that there, I think, is part of the trouble. It 
was kind of a monotonous menu. In other words, on

02:51.820 --> 03:02.150
Monday you had this, Tuesday you had this, 
Wednesday you had this, Thursday and Friday you

02:51.820 --> 03:02.150
had this, and Saturday and Sunday. And you could 
almost sit down and write the menu for the whole

03:02.590 --> 03:07.554
week. And it did get monotonous in that sense. 
Well, it wasn't because it wasn't good or

03:12.254 --> 03:15.999
well-prepared or nutritious. You just kind of get 
tired of it. So if you could rake up a few extra

03:18.242 --> 03:27.975
dimes, you'd go over to Agland every now and then 
and have a meal that you ordered yourself, what you

03:18.242 --> 03:27.975
wanted, where you wanted. It wouldn't be a bit 
better food, but it's something you sat down and

03:27.995 --> 03:37.467
ordered and ate because you wanted it instead of 
having it set in front of you. Psychological

03:37.487 --> 03:41.012
dislike more than any actual dislike. Let's see, 
was

03:41.650 --> 03:50.740
your freshman year would have been the year after 
Harold Dunn had the hamburger stand, wasn't it?

03:50.760 --> 03:51.400
25, 26? I went there in the fall of 26. Did Harold 
have a... He had it in 24 and 25 is when he had the

03:57.147 --> 04:00.330
hamburger stand. Well, I was going to say Harold is 
a class of 25, if I'm not mistaken. So he was gone. He

04:05.676 --> 04:06.797
told me, I believe, that... athletic department 
took over the hamburger stand. I think so. So it was

04:10.785 --> 04:12.467
still there when you were there? Well, now, Pop,

04:12.507 --> 04:24.561
uh, Pop, uh, the old man that ran a hamburger joint 
over there himself, he ran it. I don't know whether

04:26.063 --> 04:29.426
he was running it for the athletic department or 
who. Pop,

04:29.907 --> 04:35.333
uh, sir. I should remember that name, because 
that's where a lot of us, when we get an extra dime

04:36.781 --> 04:44.190
and didn't want to go to the mess hall, we'd go get a 
hamburger with Pops. And I can't think of his last

04:45.011 --> 04:47.794
name, because Pops is the only way I've ever called 
him. No, Harold was, I believe, a class of 25,

04:50.277 --> 04:57.626
because I met him after I moved to Lubbock. Okay.

05:04.915 --> 05:06.096
Did the... Non-military students ate in the same 
mess hall then with the military students for the

05:06.717 --> 05:12.343
last three years? In the mess hall, yeah. They 
didn't eat together. They had tables in a

05:14.946 --> 05:18.469
different area because they came in from another 
door. Most of the military came in from the, well,

05:18.770 --> 05:27.759
towards Gine Hall, down that way, and the 
non-military came in from the side over there.

05:27.779 --> 05:33.385
They ate in the same mess hall but not at a different 
table. See, all the companies ate together. They

05:36.687 --> 05:41.634
had assigned sections where they ate and they all 
ate there the whole year. And so did the

05:42.155 --> 05:43.557
non-military. We'd eat at the same place.

05:47.703 --> 05:53.231
What privileges did the upperclassmen have over 
the freshmen?

05:53.251 --> 06:01.243
Well, there wasn't many privileges that the 
freshmen had that wasn't authorized by the

05:53.251 --> 06:01.243
upperclassmen. But to me, it was a pretty 
equitable system because the sophomores were

06:02.253 --> 06:12.021
controlled by the juniors and the seniors. The 
juniors were controlled by the seniors. The

06:14.924 --> 06:18.707
seniors were controlled by the senior officers in 
the military. So you had kind of a line of command

06:19.128 --> 06:21.290
there. There wasn't any particular area that you 
could be mistreated. As I say, there's nothing

06:25.413 --> 06:31.078
lower in the world than a freshman unless it's a 
sophomore. Now, sophomore is the lowest creature

06:32.138 --> 06:38.287
on the campus, at least it used to be considered. 
Freshman, he'd get by with ignorance, didn't know

06:38.828 --> 06:46.300
when he really did know, but he could get by with it. 
He might get his pants whomped, but he could still

06:46.500 --> 06:54.552
get by with doing things that a sophomore or junior 
couldn't because they knew better. But the

06:55.544 --> 07:12.674
sophomores were kept in line primarily by the 
seniors, and the juniors themselves were pretty

06:55.544 --> 07:12.674
well kept in line by the seniors because I've seen 
many a junior get his rear end whipped by a senior

06:55.544 --> 07:12.674
for doing something that the senior didn't think 
he should do. So hazing wasn't confined to

07:13.195 --> 07:16.060
freshmen. It was all classes. All classes except 
the seniors. That's right. Well, the seniors were

07:19.886 --> 07:26.297
harassed and heckled by their own fellow officers 
and the military. They weren't actually Hays, but

07:26.318 --> 07:33.049
they had some degree of control over even them. No, 
the freshman really was the... lucky one on the

07:40.735 --> 08:00.347
campus because ignorance is not supposed to be an 
excuse for violating the law but many many of them

07:40.735 --> 08:00.347
do so well i didn't know any better i i thought you 
could do that and with the sophomore he'd get in

07:40.735 --> 08:00.347
trouble every time he'd do anything wrong so What 
about privileges to leave the campus? Did the

08:03.791 --> 08:07.256
upperclassmen have the privilege to do that more 
frequently? Oh, yes. The juniors and the seniors,

08:07.816 --> 08:12.222
as I recall, could leave any time they wanted to. 
And the juniors could most of the time they wanted

08:12.242 --> 08:14.745
to. And the sophomores, less often. And of course, 
the freshmen could not leave without specific

08:17.388 --> 08:22.554
permission, as I recall. I don't think I went to 
Bryan my freshman year. How would you have gotten

08:25.918 --> 08:28.461
to Bryan? Tuneville Trolley. Had the old trolley, 
yeah. It ran until, I think, a couple of years after

08:32.318 --> 08:36.303
I got out of there. See me like 27 or 8 or 9. I'm not 
sure when they took the old trolley off. What about

08:43.633 --> 08:50.362
your last three years there when you were 
non-military? Did you have more privileges as a

08:50.422 --> 08:56.170
non-military student than, say, the military 
students did? Well, it seems to me that we did. We

09:00.796 --> 09:02.538
had less restrictions. We were, as a civilian, the 
two years that I was in the non-military but did not

09:02.678 --> 09:13.612
wear a uniform, we pretty well came and went as we 
wanted to. We'd go to Bryan or go to Houston. Now, I

09:17.077 --> 09:25.287
don't mean we could miss class or anything like 
that, but if it was a holiday or a weekend, we could

09:17.077 --> 09:25.287
go where we wanted to with no particular problem. 
But... And even in the military, you could, I

09:28.837 --> 09:35.122
believe it was your junior and senior year. In 
other words, just the two first years that you were

09:35.162 --> 09:43.189
partially restricted to your dorm or to staying on 
the campus. But then the last year when you were

09:44.891 --> 09:52.598
non-military but you had to wear a uniform, were 
you more under military control then? No, they had

09:53.158 --> 09:57.662
nothing to do with us. We had no drilling or 
nothing. It was a means purely of identification.

10:04.279 --> 10:15.018
I think some of the military people got envious of 
our civilian clothes and said, well, golly, they

10:04.279 --> 10:15.018
ought to be in uniform, too. But, you know, my 
senior year, when I had to wear a uniform, to meals

10:19.782 --> 10:21.684
and to classes. I had one shirt and one pair of 
pants. That's all I owned that year. I had a blue

10:26.068 --> 10:35.377
serge, I mean not a blue serge, but a serge khaki 
shirt and a nice pair of slacks, and that's the only

10:26.068 --> 10:35.377
uniform I had all year. So even in the non-military 
where you were required to wear a uniform, you

10:36.578 --> 10:49.570
didn't have quite the expense or the uniforms that 
juniors and seniors require. At that point, was it

10:49.702 --> 11:03.480
a fairly

10:49.702 --> 11:03.480
universal thing for the seniors to wear the kind of 
boots that the seniors wear now, or did only the

10:49.702 --> 11:03.480
senior officers wear the boots? Everybody, every 
senior could wear them. The juniors, I mean the

11:07.426 --> 11:14.595
seniors, were the only ones that could wear boots, 
and of course Well, let's see. We went into, or the

11:16.159 --> 11:19.924
military went into slacks. I know the first year, 
my freshman year, we wore those old wrap leggings

11:21.165 --> 11:26.732
because I despised them. I think that's one thing 
that got me out of the military, wrapping that

11:26.752 --> 11:32.179
legging every morning. And it seems to me that we 
went, uh, the second year, no, by golly, the second

11:32.199 --> 11:41.190
year we had, uh, either leggings or wrap leggings, 
you know, these leather inside leggings or the

11:41.626 --> 11:46.971
wraps. I believe both years, it seems to me. But I 
think then my junior or senior year, when I was out

11:49.914 --> 11:59.924
of the Corps, it seemed to me like they went to 
slacks, but I'm not sure about the timing on that. I

11:59.944 --> 12:10.975
know my sophomore year, I won the best drill medal 
in my Company D infantry, and we were wearing those

12:11.191 --> 12:12.153
laced leggings. You know, you lace them up the 
side. I'm sure you've seen it. And I think we had

12:15.519 --> 12:26.598
quit the old wrap leggings and gone to those, and 
then I believe it was the third year I was at A&M that

12:15.519 --> 12:26.598
they went to slacks, but I could be wrong. Did you 
have any favorite instructors?

12:34.073 --> 12:39.201
I believe one of my favorites down there was C.O. 
Spriggs. I believe he was in the English

12:40.743 --> 12:46.232
department and taught public speaking. And I took 
public speaking as an elective, and I just

12:47.514 --> 12:55.867
thoroughly enjoyed the way he handled his 
courses. In other words, in teaching public

12:56.788 --> 13:01.195
speaking, He didn't have the usual format of a book 
and assignments and lessons. You were kind of on

13:06.804 --> 13:08.286
your own. And he'd make you make impromptu 
speeches and tell of some happening. You know, it

13:14.916 --> 13:17.139
kind of gets you familiar with standing on your 
feet. And I liked the general

13:17.179 --> 13:23.369
lack of formality, I believe. Now, I had some math 
teachers that I thoroughly enjoyed, Mr. Martin.

13:29.457 --> 13:34.302
My sophomore year, I believe it was, I was taking 
calculus. Yeah, Mr. Martin lived in Bryan.

13:38.125 --> 13:40.467
Incidentally, I bought his house in 1943. He was a 
mathematical wizard in my mind, and I thoroughly

13:40.908 --> 13:50.256
enjoyed him. He's the only reason I probably 
passed calculus, because I flunked it the first

13:51.157 --> 13:56.342
time I took it. And the second time I passed it, and 
only because he was such an excellent teacher. He

14:02.629 --> 14:06.152
could just make you get it whether you wanted it or 
not. And I guess he was one of my favorites. And Mr.

14:10.637 --> 14:19.105
Mitchell, A. Mitchell, that taught engineering, 
no, descriptive geometry, A. Mitchell. His son

14:20.367 --> 14:26.633
lives there in Bryan, or at least I guess he still 
does, Scripp Mitchell.

14:27.440 --> 14:38.552
I guess those would be about my three favorite 
teachers that I recall because not only subject

14:27.440 --> 14:38.552
matter but the way they handled their subject 
matter. Did you have any people in your

14:39.854 --> 14:54.510
engineering courses in particular that you felt—

14:39.854 --> 14:54.510
Like or dislike? Well, I like Si Sanstead, I 
believe, as well as him. Si's still there, isn't

14:59.304 --> 15:01.207
he, incidentally? I believe he's retired. Oh, 
yes, Lord, he's retired. He's close to 90 years

15:04.712 --> 15:06.515
old. I believe he's still living. He's old as the 
college. But he was one of my favorites. Sleepy

15:11.743 --> 15:14.087
Sanstead, they called him. Because he'd give you a 
quiz and sit up there and doze in his chair. We

15:17.292 --> 15:18.754
called him Sleepy. But he was an awful, awful nice 
man, a good instructor. and uh last uh last time I

15:23.802 --> 15:51.582
saw him he was still active as he could be and now 
he's been retired in fact he retired from teaching

15:23.802 --> 15:51.582
before I moved up here in 58. so he's bound to be in 
his 80s he's not far from 90 years old yeah well I

15:23.802 --> 15:51.582
think even then the compulsory retirement was 70 
so yeah so he's he's up well up in his 80s I'm pretty

15:23.802 --> 15:51.582
sure and Of course, Mr. Ritchie, the head of the 
Civil Engineering Department, and J.T.L. McNew

15:56.060 --> 16:03.067
were two more favorites, and I guess you might say I 
had three favorites in the C.E. Department

16:03.087 --> 16:04.889
because J.T.L. McNew taught highway 
engineering, and by the time I was a junior, well,

16:04.949 --> 16:16.962
my third, fourth, and fifth years, or the last two 
years, I knew I was working towards highway

16:04.949 --> 16:16.962
engineering. and J.T.L. McNew taught that and I 
liked him. He's a very practical man down to earth

16:21.731 --> 16:40.716
and he didn't care what the book said always if the 
book didn't tell it like it was out on the job

16:21.731 --> 16:40.716
because he worked for the public a lot in the summer 
and he was an excellent instructor. What were the

16:40.736 --> 16:45.042
attitudes of the students overall toward the 
administration? I think they had a tremendous lot

16:46.912 --> 16:51.979
of respect for the administration in general. It 
seems to me, of course, I'm sure this is a thing that

16:53.060 --> 17:14.168
everybody feels, as you get older you feel like the 
younger people don't have the respect for the

16:53.060 --> 17:14.168
administration or the

16:53.060 --> 17:14.168
people in authority that you had when you were 
young. But I think as a whole, the students were

17:14.384 --> 17:22.873
pretty respectful and held in high esteem, most of 
the administration. Because most of the

17:24.014 --> 17:32.283
administration, so far as we knew as students and 
campus life, were pretty well above approach. And

17:32.344 --> 17:38.450
I'm sure they weren't because everybody's human 
and everybody gets their foot in their mouth

17:32.344 --> 17:38.450
occasionally. But you didn't hear much about it. 
It wasn't discussed among the students, and in

17:41.114 --> 17:47.782
general, they had a pretty high respect for him, I 
think. The president was who? Thomas Otto Van

17:50.445 --> 17:52.768
Waltenburg. Theo Walton. He was a fine man. And was 
the same respect accorded to the commandant?

18:03.220 --> 18:09.147
Well, there was a little bit of, let's say, kind of 
a... slurring remarks made about the bull, the

18:09.447 --> 18:27.556
commandant, I guess because just general 
resentment toward authority, because you looked

18:09.447 --> 18:27.556
at the military as authority, and everybody 
rebels to some extent to authority at one time or

18:09.447 --> 18:27.556
another. So there was a little less now outwardly 
and in fact, to the Commandant's Office,

18:34.557 --> 18:39.482
everybody was pretty respectful because they 
were scared not to be. But there was a little more

18:40.162 --> 18:49.992
slurring remarks and catty statements about 
so-and-so and so-and-so in the military than

18:40.162 --> 18:49.992
there was in the civilian administration, it 
seemed to me. See, I mentioned at the time you were

18:50.012 --> 18:53.516
there, there were at least, what, probably two 
Commandants. Didn't they come generally for two

18:53.536 --> 18:55.918
years? No. As I recall, they were assigned for four 
years, I thought, because Colonel Nelson...

19:06.063 --> 19:24.929
Well, actually, he's the only commandant I 
remember because he was there, I think, my two

19:06.063 --> 19:24.929
freshman years, or I mean my first two years while I 
was in the military, and maybe the third year when I

19:06.063 --> 19:24.929
got in non-military. I don't know. Colonel Nelson 
is the only name I can recall while I was in school as

19:26.127 --> 19:32.320
competent, let's put it that way. Now, whether he 
was there two years or three years, I really don't

19:32.340 --> 19:36.930
know. But I was thinking they were assigned there 
for four years. I'm not quite certain about the

19:40.277 --> 19:43.343
time that you were there. It seems to me that there 
was a time period at least. earlier than that, that

19:45.989 --> 19:48.738
the commandant was a two-year hitch. Well, now, 
you could very well be right. I think there were

19:51.968 --> 19:56.121
some who got a renewal, so to speak, and stayed more 
than two. But anyway.

20:05.463 --> 20:17.505
One thing that's of some interest currently is 
perhaps less an issue now than a few years back, and

20:05.463 --> 20:17.505
that is a matter of girls on campus. And we know that 
there was a time period when there were a few girls,

20:18.166 --> 20:24.678
and then there was none. And now, of course, we have 
lots of them. Were there any girls in any of the

20:26.842 --> 20:29.867
classes when you were there? In that particular 
period, as I recall, there were no girls in school,

20:30.843 --> 20:37.770
except now they could go to summer school. If you 
went to summer school, there would be girls in

20:38.751 --> 20:41.894
classes in summer. So far as I can remember, ever 
since I can remember anything about A&M, girls

20:42.354 --> 20:49.742
could go to summer school. There was no 
restriction on summer school, as I recall. There

20:52.825 --> 20:54.306
was no military. That's right, no military 
activity going on then. But there were no girls in

20:59.142 --> 21:10.476
any of the classes through the regular term during 
my period down there, and I don't think there had

20:59.142 --> 21:10.476
been for six, eight, or ten years. It seems to me 
some of the professors' daughters graduated

21:10.596 --> 21:19.787
there, and I've seen in the histories somewhere, 
archives somewhere, and you probably know more

21:10.596 --> 21:19.787
about that. There was one or two who actually 
graduated from A&M years and years ago. But then

21:25.795 --> 21:27.597
for a long period in there, All they could do was go 
in summers, I recall.

21:34.819 --> 21:43.271
At the time that you were there, did the students 
who participated in intercollegiate athletics

21:34.819 --> 21:43.271
enjoy any special privileges?

21:46.476 --> 21:57.972
Oh, to some extent, I think you could say they did, 
because any notable individual is given

21:46.476 --> 21:57.972
certain...

21:46.476 --> 21:57.972
Oh... limits or limitations or less limitations 
on behavior probably than just an ordinary

21:58.627 --> 22:25.208
student because that's part of the essence of of 
notoriety they they just actually but so far as the

21:58.627 --> 22:25.208
actual uh privileges all i know of they had a 
special eating place they ate uh a little better,

22:25.441 --> 22:31.352
supposedly, and I used to remember that they got 
all the milk they wanted. Now, that's the one thing

22:31.372 --> 22:38.986
that stands out in my mind, because I loved milk, 
and we never had enough milk at the regular table.

22:39.307 --> 22:42.994
But at the training table, they gave them all the 
milk they wanted. And outside of that, I don't

22:43.852 --> 22:48.398
think there was any particular special food or 
anything. It was sometime after you were there

22:48.418 --> 22:52.944
then that they had a separate athletic dormitory. 
Oh, yeah. In fact, it was in the 40s, it seems to me,

22:53.545 --> 22:58.191
after the war. I don't know when it was. Yeah. 
Didn't old Bear Bryant get the first dormitory

23:00.635 --> 23:10.568
built or it started in his regime or had they just 
built it when Bear Bryant came there in the 50s? I

23:11.628 --> 23:26.974
think it was earlier than that that they had to put 
them all, took them out of their military company

23:11.628 --> 23:26.974
and put them in the— Well, they may have, but I 
remember Henderson Hall, and I was thinking that

23:11.628 --> 23:26.974
was built about the time Barry Bryant came there in 
the early 50s, but I'm not sure of that. I mean, I

23:27.194 --> 23:28.937
believe that they were separated. Well, they 
probably were, probably were.

23:35.268 --> 23:35.408
Okay. were any number of the athletes 
non-military for the last two years? Quite a few. I

23:43.681 --> 23:55.623
remember old Joel Hunt was, and as I recall, it 
seems to me Joel and one or two other of the football

23:43.681 --> 23:55.623
players went into the non-military. In other 
words, they didn't want to be bothered with

23:55.663 --> 23:58.729
drilling and so forth. Now, I'm not even positive 
about that, Charles, because as I say, I didn't

23:59.570 --> 24:08.500
associate, didn't know them, and I just knew of 
them. When you finished A&M then, did you have a job

24:09.961 --> 24:16.709
lined up before you graduated?

24:19.192 --> 24:22.876
In 1931, Charles, there wasn't any jobs anywhere. 
If you remember, that was the bottom of the well.

24:27.633 --> 24:32.578
No, I was pretty desperate because I had gotten my 
degree. I couldn't go home without a job because I

24:32.598 --> 24:41.526
was the first one in all of my family history that 
had ever gone to college. And to go home without a

24:42.127 --> 24:55.480
job after going to college, I just, well, I told 
somebody there in Bryan after I finally went to

24:42.127 --> 24:55.480
work, I said, I'd have started robbing before I'd 
have gone home and admitted I didn't have a job

24:42.127 --> 24:55.480
after getting a college degree. But I finally 
managed to get a job there in Bryan with the highway

24:56.540 --> 25:08.112
department because I think I got the man's 
attention. I was so desperate that I offered to

25:08.393 --> 25:12.057
work. I told Mr. Todd, the man that I went to work 
for, he was a resident engineer there in Bryan. I

25:18.844 --> 25:22.868
told him, I says, I will work one month for nothing. 
just to prove to you how bad I need a job and that I

25:24.367 --> 25:28.211
will work. Well, I'll never forget, he laughed and 
looked at me and he says, you know, I believe you

25:29.992 --> 25:34.797
want to work. I said, Mr. Todd, you don't know how 
bad I want to work. I meant every word I said. I'll

25:39.922 --> 25:43.765
work for a month for nothing because I got to have a 
job. I can't go home without a job. Okay. So I

25:47.629 --> 25:49.431
started to work for $3 a day. Of course, he paid me. 
He didn't let me work a month for nothing, but I

25:54.016 --> 26:10.380
still think that that got his attention in the fact 
that, well, he does need to work, and they did need

25:54.016 --> 26:10.380
people in the highway department, but I didn't 
have any more chance than dozens of others who had

25:54.016 --> 26:10.380
been to see him. But like the man with the mule, I 
think I got his attention. What was your first

26:17.030 --> 26:19.433
position in with the highway department? Rodman, 
they called me a rodman. I drug a chain and held this

26:22.189 --> 26:30.977
line rod that they used to sight at and cut brush and 
drove stakes. Laying out new highways. Yep,

26:33.280 --> 26:40.607
staking a new highway or setting construction 
stakes for construction or rebuilding.

26:44.631 --> 26:45.652
And that's where I started. First to June or around 
the first of June of 1931. How

26:49.788 --> 26:57.656
long did you stay in the Bryan office then, the 
highway department? I was in the Bryan district

26:58.658 --> 27:12.893
there for 28 years when I moved out here, 27 years I 
believe it was, from 1931 to 58, 27 years.

27:15.556 --> 27:20.363
did they offer you then the opportunity to move to 
Lubbock, or did you request that? No, the state

27:20.383 --> 27:25.251
highway engineer appointed me district engineer 
in Lubbock in 1958. I had been through all of the

27:25.411 --> 27:36.789
positions in a district headquarters or office, 
including assistant district engineer. And I had

27:38.311 --> 27:42.357
been assistant district engineer in Bryan for 
Well, from 53 to the last of 57, about between four

27:44.328 --> 27:51.058
and five years. And then Mr. Greer, who was a state 
Iowa engineer then, asked me if I would like to come

27:52.020 --> 27:58.149
to Lubbock as district engineer. And I was like the 
idiot that went around on the drill field picking

27:58.189 --> 28:07.464
up pieces of paper until he found a paper that said, 
you are hereby discharged from the Army. He says,

28:07.504 --> 28:09.627
this is the one I've been looking for. And that job 
was the one I'd been looking for because to me it's

28:12.070 --> 28:25.050
the best job in the highway department and that's 
what I'd always aspired to be, a district

28:12.070 --> 28:25.050
engineer, so Santa Claus came to see me in 1958. And 
so we moved to Lubbock and I worked for 15 years

28:25.350 --> 28:37.909
almost to a day because I moved here the first of 
February, 58, and retired 1st of February, 1973.

28:39.505 --> 28:44.912
So almost, just almost a day, 15 years. What would 
you say would be some of the principal

28:47.076 --> 28:52.563
developments in the last 40 years in highway 
construction?

29:01.696 --> 29:07.204
I guess computerization of many of our 
calculations would be the most drastic change

29:07.623 --> 29:19.337
because basically we're using the same type of 
materials to build roads we've always used. Sand,

29:19.738 --> 29:28.348
gravel, caliche, crushed stone, cement, steel, 
you know, concrete. We've been using that for 40

29:29.109 --> 29:32.533
some odd years. And your method of surveying 
aerial photography, computerization of many of

29:33.560 --> 29:45.375
our calculations of design of intricate 
structures that used to take weeks and months of

29:46.098 --> 29:56.909
careful figuring and checking back to see that 
your calculations were correct. Would this be

29:56.929 --> 29:59.052
calculations like on the cloverleaf? Yeah. And 
you also can use computers for determining

30:00.774 --> 30:07.100
elevations. You've seen some of these four-level 
interchanges. They call them mixmasters. Well,

30:13.707 --> 30:14.468
all of the Grades and elevations are computed with 
a computer. By feeding certain information into

30:21.092 --> 30:29.722
it, it'll come out and give you the elevations of 
these various points on this Mixmaster looking

30:21.092 --> 30:29.722
thing. Otherwise, it would be impossible to build 
some of the interchanges that they have today

30:29.742 --> 30:37.831
without computerization. Just like without 
computers, it would have been impossible to go to

30:37.851 --> 30:42.396
the moon. You just got to have it because you do the 
figuring of 100 people.
