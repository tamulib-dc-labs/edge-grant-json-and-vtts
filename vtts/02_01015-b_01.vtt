WEBVTT

00:02.933 --> 00:11.304
to finish on part of that was, if you're an American 
unit, you only saw the Vietnamese in battle, near

00:02.933 --> 00:11.304
battles, getting ready for battle, just after a 
battle. You're going through an area. Yes, there

00:14.748 --> 00:24.882
was the, I think, troop-wise, particularly, 
other than a few gestures caught on, a few words for

00:14.748 --> 00:24.882
certain things, a barrier. The big surprise was 
how many Vietnamese spoke English. The children

00:31.688 --> 00:35.913
would speak English, you know, called GI slang 
English. The advisors would stay in an area long

00:37.395 --> 00:49.130
enough, and a lot of them were second, third tour 
people, who had been there, were back, that you

00:37.395 --> 00:49.130
were more at home. In fact, we had some advisors who 
everybody had to be fluent in French because they

00:49.190 --> 00:58.202
worked with an artillery unit, and the Vietnamese 
artillery was done in French. So you had second and

00:59.549 --> 01:05.401
third languages you could converse in in a lot of 
cases. A lot of our operators spoke other

01:05.922 --> 01:11.393
languages that the Vietnamese would speak, and 
you had one or two in common. And you weren't

01:13.176 --> 01:15.060
this... Plus, after you stayed in the area, you 
could go into the markets. You could go places. You

01:20.455 --> 01:22.158
didn't have the feeling. You may have still been 
isolated. Don't make that mistake. But you didn't

01:25.222 --> 01:28.526
have this feeling of, I'm totally alone in this 
town. If something happens, nobody's going to

01:28.947 --> 01:30.469
help me. After you lived there a while, you felt 
when it was. And the Vietnamese would say, no

01:35.696 --> 01:38.059
operation today. We stay in the compound. You knew 
the commons were doing something. They didn't

01:40.582 --> 01:42.605
tell you. If you want to go on downtown, go ahead. 
Remember, it's your risk. And you developed a, I

01:47.643 --> 01:55.701
would say, a more personal relationship. You saw 
the people in different lights. You saw them out

01:57.024 --> 01:59.710
plowing the fields and some of the jobs I went 
through. You went out and you worked with the rural

02:00.371 --> 02:03.799
development programs and things. You worked with 
them, so you were out there. And it wasn't this, you

02:07.336 --> 02:12.403
didn't drive by at 50 miles an hour in a truck and 
look out and see Vietnam. Dismount from the

02:12.904 --> 02:14.706
helicopter and go into battle. That was the 
difference. I didn't live in a wire compound. I was

02:18.291 --> 02:19.052
in wire. But I was in a Vietnamese compound with 
Vietnamese. We had our own cooks. We ate mostly

02:24.740 --> 02:26.522
their food. We ate ours. Advisors were not 
supplied with food. You acquired your food on the

02:30.288 --> 02:32.471
market. So... This gave you contact. If you wanted 
to eat your breakfast or whatever the hell you ate,

02:38.572 --> 02:44.358
remember don't sit at the same table and vary your 
time, otherwise you'll be a stat. You'll just come

02:45.259 --> 02:46.241
up with statistics. If you get dumb and you go to 
breakfast every morning at 8 o'clock, 8 o'clock, 8

02:46.261 --> 02:56.312
o'clock, 8 o'clock, 8 o'clock, somebody's gonna 
catch on and you go to breakfast every morning at 8

02:46.261 --> 02:56.312
o'clock, shoot the suits down at 8 o'clock. So you 
had to do that kind of a thing, but... Uh, you

03:01.302 --> 03:04.987
weren't this, uh... You were constantly under 
surveillance. You were always under

03:05.007 --> 03:06.188
surveillance. You just got used to just... 
There's a war on, everybody's got their spies,

03:07.410 --> 03:10.013
both sides did. You tried to vary your routine 
enough that nobody would nail you. Don't be dumb.

03:17.523 --> 03:19.305
Uh, don't go to town by yourself. Don't go without a 
weapon. Don't go without loading it. Uh, but I

03:27.135 --> 03:31.140
worked in an area that you could drive... between 
towns unarmed was that pacified normally it could

03:33.061 --> 04:01.009
also you could drive into a thousand men force 
crossing that area so it's just which card did the

03:33.061 --> 04:01.009
deck turn up did you flip a joker or an ace you flip 
the ace nothing's wrong you flip the joker we'll

03:33.061 --> 04:01.009
see about it how did you cope with this with the 
stress that was inherent in especially i guess

03:33.061 --> 04:01.009
with the phoenix You know what's funny, and you 
asked that at Air Force, if there's a battle on, you

04:01.580 --> 04:06.928
don't feel it. Probably the biggest stress was 
always trying to please the commander, and after a

04:09.812 --> 04:15.700
while, you kind of got calloused. I did, and some 
others I know worked around there did. We didn't

04:18.584 --> 04:19.125
care.

04:22.870 --> 04:27.697
Now, you got long-term, I guess, look at it and be 
fair, we got long-term stress from the war. Nobody

04:27.717 --> 04:28.719
knew about it then. I mean, naive enough, young 
enough to... You lived over it, and that's all it

04:31.955 --> 04:33.597
counted. You know, I got back with ten toes and 
fingers. Did it bother you? No. Well, you know, day

04:39.245 --> 04:51.581
to day in the advisory program, the biggest 
stress, I guess, would have been in the U.S. Army

04:39.245 --> 04:51.581
units where you didn't know if the phone was going 
to ring at 3 a.m. or 6 a.m. Load up, Lieutenant, it's

04:39.245 --> 04:51.581
time to go somewhere. Where is where? Get on the 
chopper. We'll brief you. We'll brief you for 20

04:54.145 --> 04:55.266
minutes. The order of battle people are here. The 
interrogators are going. Here's your briefing.

04:59.452 --> 05:00.493
Here's a briefing from the electronic warfare 
groups, radio research, ASA.

05:07.757 --> 05:08.137
You went. When you were going to battle, there 
wasn't time to worry about it. After it was over,

05:13.022 --> 05:19.648
most of the guys came back and just got them a good 
nose full of drinking. It was go out, shoot up the

05:19.668 --> 05:24.433
woods or get shot up, come in and drink. It was a 
tension breaker. In true life, you want to go swim

05:26.755 --> 05:29.518
in the ocean with the sharks, you couldn't. I don't 
think, in saying, you know, how do you handle

05:31.338 --> 05:38.548
stress, I don't think we looked at it that way. It 
was just a job that had bullets involved.

05:43.134 --> 05:48.502
I think a lot of it was not looking at it, but there 
wasn't any program around, would you like to talk

05:43.134 --> 05:48.502
about how you feel? Are you kidding? You talk about 
how you feel and say it the wrong way, you'll, mm,

05:50.365 --> 05:54.631
let's watch him. So everybody caught on, just 
don't say anything. If you weren't looking at the

05:58.075 --> 05:59.978
end of a bottle, that was your business. I'd be 
ready to go at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning or

06:00.835 --> 06:03.098
whenever. I don't think the Army had a plan for 
that. It was just something that wasn't looked at.

06:10.509 --> 06:11.690
At least I never thought about it. I'm not aware of 
ever sitting down and saying, hey, let's have a

06:11.931 --> 06:15.456
talk about stress. I think after operations that 
went wrong or some of your friends got killed or

06:15.576 --> 06:26.631
wounded, I think you felt emotional ups and downs, 
but I never did really, if you want to sound silly,

06:15.576 --> 06:26.631
associate that with stress. I'd sure like to go out 
there next time and kick them be with the crew it

06:31.042 --> 06:35.787
goes, you know, but I mean that was the thing there. 
What did you think of the military leadership

06:37.349 --> 06:45.919
during your days in Vietnam? You know, when you ask 
what do you think of leadership, and I guess one of

06:45.939 --> 06:56.290
the things working at the staff where you have a 
two-star general, and then on a team where there's

06:45.939 --> 06:56.290
a colonel, I think the leaders, and this is, of 
course, looking in total retrospect, I think the

06:56.843 --> 07:02.388
leaders sat in their offices too much. It's a joke 
that goes and went in Vietnam. What other war could

07:04.911 --> 07:09.215
you fight in if you were a commander from a 
helicopter at 5,000 feet? You fly home and the

07:09.715 --> 07:12.158
troops and the intelligence crew walks back.

07:15.181 --> 07:16.542
I'm not saying they're incompetent. I don't think 
that was the case, but I think something looking

07:16.562 --> 07:22.868
backward, and it'll be true in the next war the same 
as this one. You always fight the last war you

07:23.168 --> 07:25.972
fought the best. You fight it again. We fought the 
World War II model in Vietnam with a modification

07:28.296 --> 07:33.604
from Korea. You know, we talk about how mobile are 
we. Well, we'll give you a helicopter. It can haul

07:38.812 --> 07:39.994
you anywhere. We put you on the ground. Let's see 
you walk with 125 pounds.

07:48.616 --> 07:51.060
We can get you from point A to B, the big spot. It was 
moving you on the ground that 10 clicks was tough.

07:54.827 --> 07:58.312
The leadership probably, in truth, ranged from 
very good to bad. We had an Americal Division. One

08:01.237 --> 08:09.291
of our assistant deputy commanders relieved for 
failing to provide his troops enough water. I'm

08:10.469 --> 08:12.071
not sure what I think of. Fill your canteen this 
morning and carry two of them because you may not

08:12.371 --> 08:18.557
have any more water until the shooting stops.

08:23.823 --> 08:25.244
It's what a war is about. I think the leadership

08:26.986 --> 08:33.212
probably got lied to also, which affects how I see 
it. I've read that a lot of the The leaders didn't

08:39.967 --> 08:43.172
want to, they wouldn't report bad. Oh, no, no, no. 
You don't, no, no, no, no. Don't do that. You

08:47.678 --> 08:54.568
reported, at least in some cases, what you knew the 
boss wanted to hear. We developed the body count

08:57.332 --> 09:01.478
game as an example of what you had to do. If your 
promotion depended on how many men you killed, not

09:03.000 --> 09:07.527
how good a leader were you, You got what they term 
the ratio. You have to get your ratio of kills up,

09:10.347 --> 09:12.589
Lieutenant. It's sort of like working on an 
assembly line, turning out sets. You're doing a

09:17.854 --> 09:21.678
fine job, but we don't need two sets a day from you. 
We need two every 10 minutes. You've assembled

09:24.200 --> 09:25.362
them perfectly. There's nothing wrong with them. 
Now get the numbers up. Instead of saying, were you

09:28.264 --> 09:30.427
good leaders or bad leaders? Were you lucky or 
unlucky? It became, how many of them compared to

09:32.008 --> 09:37.834
you as a fraction did you kill?

09:38.422 --> 09:41.086
I'm not always sure the guys higher up knew what 
happened out there. It's been said that they

09:42.127 --> 09:49.518
followed the strategy of attrition, that that was 
the only strategy. Oh, well, it was one of them. And

09:52.603 --> 09:58.872
one of the reasons it was one of them was, how do you 
measure success in killing an enemy army? Count

09:59.032 --> 09:59.713
the bodies. It's sort of like, you see, 
unfortunately it worked out was, They had an

10:05.843 --> 10:10.629
endless supply of people, and we did too. It's like 
going in a football game. You play with a sprained

10:12.011 --> 10:14.053
ankle, a jammed thumb. Now you've got your second 
thumb sprained. You've twisted your knee. How

10:18.959 --> 10:21.202
much pain do you play with? The problem of counting 
bodies was if it had been finite limits on each side

10:22.884 --> 10:29.252
that was going to get there, it's okay. But by the 
way, how do you decide when you've got a stack of

10:29.941 --> 10:32.684
dead ends? The soldiers are not sure they are. You 
don't kill civilians. Count them. One, two. How

10:42.016 --> 10:42.857
many guns? Well, gosh, a couple.

10:49.165 --> 10:53.911
Do you have to have, and we even developed a rule in 
some areas you had to put your foot on the chest of

10:49.165 --> 10:53.911
the dead man. Step on him if you want to call it that. 
Count him. Because people lied. Sir, I think we got

10:59.825 --> 11:02.950
about, and you fill in the blank. Pick a good 
number. You see, you had just got chewed last week

11:04.071 --> 11:14.066
for not having enough, so this weekend a firefight 
away from everybody else, you still didn't get

11:04.071 --> 11:14.066
enough, but Sarge, there ain't nobody ever going 
to know but us. Send them 10. 10. The numbers were

11:18.452 --> 11:19.474
suspect. Who got counted? You counted everything 
that was out there. If it was dead. If it's dead,

11:24.300 --> 11:25.162
count it. Hold on. There's also been a lot of talk 
about careerism with officers. Well, I think

11:37.203 --> 11:42.949
ticket punching was prevalent.

11:43.990 --> 11:50.498
If you wanted to stay, you better look like a duck, 
quack like a duck, walk like a duck. If you didn't,

11:50.518 --> 11:56.084
you weren't going to be a duck.

11:56.104 --> 11:59.027
And there's an elite inside the Army. An army 
within an army, if you want to call it that. And they

12:02.214 --> 12:05.419
always will be in any bureaucracy, and that's what 
an army is. Any bureaucracy you have has the elite

12:05.880 --> 12:09.605
inside of it. Some group in charge whose 
definition of standards are the rules we all work

12:09.625 --> 12:18.238
by. It may help you. It may hurt you. In this 
instance, you were out of touch. I think the group

12:26.991 --> 12:29.014
inside was out of touch. But it's the old game of how 
do you reform something that size? A

12:35.625 --> 12:38.849
well-intentioned reform turns into disaster 
when you implement it. And one of the problems was

12:40.371 --> 12:45.278
the criteria we judged lieutenants on. By the way, 
anybody who got a rating in the Army

12:45.538 --> 12:56.072
didn't take in personality conflicts. It didn't 
allow for other things that may have affected

12:56.092 --> 12:59.997
scores. And it became a game. If you wanted to stay 
in, you had to do certain things at certain points

13:01.872 --> 13:06.780
in your career. You had to. You had to command at 
certain times. If you didn't, you would be a staff

13:11.769 --> 13:13.772
officer forever. Don't expect to rise to general. 
You had to find the firefight to get yourself well

13:16.076 --> 13:21.765
decorated. Because that was a ticket punch to show 
everybody above you, those below didn't count.

13:29.227 --> 13:30.449
Don't worry about them. It's all the ones above who 
look back and say, hey, look at this one. He walks on

13:35.456 --> 13:38.420
water. I forgot to tell them it was January 1st in 
Wisconsin, but that's okay. He's got the required

13:42.605 --> 13:45.970
I was there. Click.

13:51.176 --> 13:53.119
You had to know how the team played the game. Don't 
be a maverick. Don't rock the boat. Boat rocking

13:58.461 --> 13:59.942
could be discouraged. It could prove hazardous to 
your health. But I think there's a trade-off out

14:05.448 --> 14:07.691
there. If you did the best job you could, then you 
took the lick however it came down. If it was good,

14:13.758 --> 14:14.699
fine. If it was bad, so what? And to say something of 
all the medals and all the money and all the

14:17.642 --> 14:22.347
decorations you can put on a soldier, If he's 
satisfied with himself and what he did, there's

14:23.305 --> 14:29.114
nothing you can put on him. And if he's not, I don't 
care what you hang out there. You can't make him

14:31.117 --> 14:33.120
what he's not. And an old man in World War I 
remarked, been to Vietnam and other places, said,

14:34.863 --> 14:46.821
40 cents and all your medals will get you a cup of 
coffee in a cheap restaurant. It's still true.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.681
They're one sign of it. And some guys get them and 
shouldn't have them. Some don't. Some do. It's

14:55.846 --> 14:56.727
potluck dinner. It's what did your boss think of 
what you were doing. Suppose your ratio was a

14:59.569 --> 15:01.751
little low, lieutenants. Your boss don't 
decorate you. Heck no. So get your ratio higher

15:04.474 --> 15:06.536
than the other three lieutenants. And now you see, 
suddenly, I knew it. I knew it all along. See, I told

15:10.579 --> 15:11.660
you. If you just do what I said, see, you caught on. 
He didn't catch on and learn how to play the game.

15:18.419 --> 15:19.921
What's the boss looking for? Do I want shine shoes, 
good haircuts? I don't want you producing. It's

15:27.128 --> 15:28.170
quite judgment scale. We use a lot of shine boots 
and haircuts. Someone said, don't have the guy in

15:31.293 --> 15:35.538
front of you stop too soon because you could get 
hurt in a traffic jam. But there was a lot of it,

15:37.400 --> 15:39.682
sure. I think all armies work on it. If you look like 
one, you act like one, you associate with one,

15:43.512 --> 15:48.096
maybe you become one. I don't know. I'll leave it at 
that. I think that's what it might be. For the first

15:52.921 --> 16:01.228
time ever, fragging became a significant 
statistic in Vietnam. We had, where I was, no

16:01.248 --> 16:05.732
problem. I will say I was in places where in 
official capacity it had happened. But I was not

16:13.617 --> 16:16.541
there for any of it. We had a Marine unit near our 
compound in July that somebody tried to get their

16:17.302 --> 16:24.552
first sergeant. They didn't get him. He took the 
whole company outside in their shorts, and he

16:25.954 --> 16:30.460
found all the hidden grenades. But we simply 
didn't have the problem. Most of ours, where I was

16:33.945 --> 16:40.694
in the problem, were stupid accidents that we 
investigated. Dumbness.

16:45.123 --> 16:49.932
People blowing fingers off with cleaning rods and 
rifles before checking to see if they were moved

16:45.123 --> 16:49.932
around from the chamber. But we didn't have, where 
I was and wasn't aware of it being an incident until

16:51.435 --> 16:58.970
I came back, or near that time, I mean, yeah. It was 
brought to our attention later, they didn't, hey.

17:02.677 --> 17:06.625
But no contact with it.

17:14.890 --> 17:30.150
So did you, back on to the kill ratio strategy of 
attrition as a measure of success,

17:14.890 --> 17:30.150
do you think that's an important statistic? I 
mean, what effect do you think it had on the troops?

17:32.793 --> 17:35.517
I mean, what effect, obviously, is it people 
falling? Everybody lied. Everybody lied. I

17:37.499 --> 17:38.500
shouldn't say it in quotes. We'll put it in quotes. 
Everybody that everybody ever heard about lied,

17:39.241 --> 17:42.445
but none of them ever did it themselves. Maybe the 
way to say that. Never did it myself, but all my

17:45.232 --> 17:47.355
friends lied. I probably just got an answer there. 
But you see, it's something I can measure. What do

17:57.008 --> 18:00.854
you think would have been a more appropriate 
measure? That's the hard part. Counting bodies

18:02.796 --> 18:04.358
was the easy part. If there's anything to count, 
well, here's one and there's one. We didn't try to

18:09.447 --> 18:11.249
judge the battles. Were they big units? Were you 
outgunned? Were you overwhelmed? How did you do in

18:15.314 --> 18:17.777
a specific circumstance? That wasn't. That would 
have taken more judgment. And you don't want

18:21.782 --> 18:23.144
subjective calls. You want something you can 
measure that I can absolutely walk out,

18:23.164 --> 18:31.714
Lieutenant, point my finger in your face as a 
commanding general and say, you, Lieutenant, are

18:23.164 --> 18:31.714
the finest lieutenant I've got in this division. I 
wish all my lieutenants were like you. It was easy

18:35.298 --> 18:36.720
that way. The hard ones to do is what happened if 
your unit never went in combat? And the one time it

18:40.290 --> 18:42.634
did, you lost three guys and bagged nobody. You had 
a terrible kill ratio. You lost three guys and

18:44.377 --> 18:45.899
didn't get anybody. Your whole career could have 
been finished on that. The one contact you had. You

18:54.372 --> 18:55.013
got lucky. You walked out there. The artillery 
tube was laid on the spot you were on. Here they

18:57.897 --> 18:59.940
came, and you killed 1,100 of them. Man, I wish 
every platoon leader. It's the examples. It's how

19:03.287 --> 19:09.012
we use the example of the kill ratio, I think, was 
the bad part. I'm not sure measuring it or not

19:09.032 --> 19:13.257
measuring is good or bad in itself. I think you need 
to kind of keep up with it. But we made it the all or

19:14.918 --> 19:16.820
nothing. You had to be the best every time you went 
out. You had to walk on water no matter what the

19:22.426 --> 19:25.449
temperature was.

19:29.293 --> 19:29.353
OK. What was your opinion of the enemy?

19:35.826 --> 19:36.347
Professional.

19:39.893 --> 19:40.515
Doing the job. And I'm basically talking about the 
North Vietnamese Army. At least compared in a way

19:45.787 --> 19:54.879
to us, and I'm using quote marks, highly 
motivated, believed in a cause versus I'm there

19:45.787 --> 19:54.879
for my year in some cases. A lot of others, they were 
just sent there as punishment. You acted bad in

19:57.903 --> 20:03.490
North Vietnam, your father didn't do what we want, 
so we shipped the kids south as punishment. It

20:03.510 --> 20:04.071
varied. Their officer corps

20:04.972 --> 20:13.043
and their staffs were probably as good as ours. 
When

20:15.487 --> 20:27.545
you get out into this game,

20:15.487 --> 20:27.545
what do you think of the gorilla you caught 
carrying a bag of rice? He got taken out of the

20:28.846 --> 20:31.250
village at gunpoint. And not having a gun, if I'd 
have been in his spot in that village, I'd have been

20:32.171 --> 20:38.921
carrying a bag of rice, impressed into the 
service. Gunpoint draft. Both armies used it.

20:41.913 --> 20:44.296
South Vietnamese used it. The VC, the NVA, if they 
needed a lot of equipment, move and walk in a

20:44.316 --> 20:51.145
village, take every male with them. You carry the 
rockets, you carry the equipment. As soon as they

20:53.047 --> 20:56.292
finished portering this heavy job, they'd turn 
you loose and send you home. They didn't want to

20:56.572 --> 20:57.633
feed you either.

21:01.358 --> 21:02.840
But the core of their army was pro. And I think 
that's the mispicture we have. We painted

21:06.845 --> 21:10.350
ourselves a picture of a stupid little guy in a 
conical hat who can't do anything right. And we

21:14.107 --> 21:15.850
were the only fools that bought the picture. 
Self-deception. And I would think that was the

21:20.538 --> 21:27.729
big, and I think the higher up it went, the bigger 
that picture got. If you hadn't been there, the

21:30.153 --> 21:35.562
only thing you had that said Vietnam was what it was 
was reported across your desk. You know, and if

21:36.875 --> 21:43.082
someone asked someone to describe the war in 
Vietnam, it's impossible. Three corps with every

21:43.102 --> 21:56.758
terrain feature you want, every level of 
intensity of warfare, from guerrilla, from

21:43.102 --> 21:56.758
sniping, from mining, to stand up and slug it out 
with you in a set-piece battle. And we were there

21:56.778 --> 21:58.060
for 20 years. Tactics equipment evolved. The war 
remained a constant, and we kept counting

22:00.663 --> 22:04.047
numbers. There's no way to describe it. It was 
never the same in your place, two days. One day it's

22:11.701 --> 22:17.789
a perfectly peaceful village you've driven 
through a hundred times, and tomorrow you come in

22:11.701 --> 22:17.789
and everybody in the world is personally down 
there trying to get you. That's what it feels like.

22:21.474 --> 22:29.604
And,

22:21.474 --> 22:29.604
you know, the morale question we had, do you? And I 
think both sides fought with a different set of

22:30.585 --> 22:33.088
handbooks. We fought with one that held Americans 
to a different standard, at least on paper, than

22:34.115 --> 22:42.807
the other side employed. I'm not sure, looking 
backward, that I would want it any other way. At the

22:50.177 --> 22:57.066
same time, I think we need to be more realistic 
about why are we there to start with. You know, one

22:58.688 --> 23:03.615
of the things that evolved out of a lot of guys, if 
you're going to fight a war, go to win and go stay

22:58.688 --> 23:03.615
home. And I teach government and understand and 
recognize the difference between a declaration

23:06.228 --> 23:12.458
of war and an undeclared war. However, for the 
people you send to carry out your foreign policy, I

23:12.578 --> 23:22.073
think it would help if you had a clear objective, 
and we never had a clear objective. It was do this

23:22.874 --> 23:25.759
and do that and do the other. It's been said in 
Vietnam, we didn't lose any of the battles. We won

23:29.625 --> 23:31.247
all the battles and lost the war. We lost battles. 
We got surprised. We got ambushed. We got killed.

23:41.564 --> 23:46.211
Compared to what we did to the other side, we killed 
thousands, if not millions. And one of the

23:47.873 --> 23:57.847
questions was, if you want to look at Vietnam as an 
exercise in strangeness, we dropped more tonnage

23:47.873 --> 23:57.847
of bombs in Vietnam than we dropped in World War II. 
But what did we bomb? We bombed bridges. We bombed

24:02.814 --> 24:05.277
things that we thought would disrupt something. 
You bomb the wrong targets because their army

24:05.999 --> 24:10.404
didn't operate the way your army operated. 
Everybody always assigns or ascribes to the other

24:11.245 --> 24:19.695
person your characteristics, your creature 
comforts, your habits. What if it doesn't happen?

24:23.960 --> 24:31.869
You know, one of the things we didn't do, we didn't 
break the dam above Hanoi and Haiphong and flood

24:23.960 --> 24:31.869
the country. We didn't blow up the railway tunnel. 
the Chinese had on the border region. We didn't do a

24:39.123 --> 24:42.928
bunch of things, and I'm not sure, you know, what 
the consequence. They didn't ask lieutenants, do

24:42.948 --> 24:45.731
you want to go do these things, lieutenant? You do 
what you're told. But there are a lot of things you

24:49.236 --> 24:52.860
wonder, why wasn't something different done? Not 
that you had a plan. Most of us didn't. Hi, here I am.

24:56.905 --> 24:57.586
What's going on? Can I keep my backside attached to 
my front side?

25:03.577 --> 25:09.506
What was your opinion of the South Vietnamese body 
forces, RFPS? Well, the Arvins fought well when

25:10.407 --> 25:15.475
well led. But you had to recognize what caused the 
Arvin problems was the commanders farmed them out

25:16.937 --> 25:27.554
as servants, hired labor, made them buy their own 
rations, stole from their own troops. The

25:29.156 --> 25:30.478
soldiers themselves

25:33.682 --> 25:36.705
We're no better or no worse than your own army and 
the other side. It's what does leadership or lack

25:37.386 --> 25:40.189
of leadership do to your army? I think that was the 
problem, was the corruptness. Up the chain, not at

25:45.816 --> 25:48.359
the very bottom. At the very bottom, I have nothing 
but respect for all of them. And I fought with units

25:51.783 --> 25:54.426
that ran, and I fought with units that stood. And it 
hangs on leadership. You earn your pay,

25:58.671 --> 26:01.033
Lieutenant. It's time to stand up. Anybody... And 
we tell the joke, anybody could manage a company as

26:03.331 --> 26:07.878
long as you got all the money and spare parts you 
need. It's when you're out of money and out of

26:08.459 --> 26:11.364
parts, let's see how good a manager you are. When 
it's not going right is when you should judge

26:12.606 --> 26:16.993
management, when it's tough. And I think the call 
was, yeah, their army ran.

26:22.762 --> 26:23.743
Called them a lot of things. A lot of the troops did. 
I think it was easier to call them that from an

26:25.977 --> 26:31.082
American viewpoint until you worked in the 
advisor program and really saw what happened.

26:31.743 --> 26:36.028
Once you were internal to seeing part of it, then 
the picture changed why the guys ran. You now got

26:36.909 --> 26:39.491
the answer to the question you never had as the 
American unit. They didn't run because they

26:40.152 --> 26:41.133
wanted to. They ran because they were out of 
supplies or out of ammunition, out of equipment.

26:45.097 --> 26:46.379
There were units that didn't work right. But the 
area I was in, we didn't have that problem with

26:47.860 --> 26:52.025
them. They had problems with stealing petty 
stuff, chickens and things.

26:57.803 --> 27:01.566
The Vietnamese solved that own problem in their 
own judicial system. We didn't get into theirs.

27:07.051 --> 27:11.915
You've already mentioned what you thought about 
the tour of duty. And did you say that the

27:11.935 --> 27:21.823
military's gone back to the... We are going back to 
what's called cohorts, our fixed regimental size

27:11.935 --> 27:21.823
units, things maybe with different names. But a 
group of people will enter, serve, work together,

27:22.384 --> 27:27.608
train together, fight together, be replaced 
together. It's stability is what we're heading

27:28.043 --> 27:29.785
back to. You think that policy had a... Can you 
really measure the effect? Yeah, I think you can

27:37.653 --> 27:39.576
measure the effect. I think you can look at Vietnam 
and the next war you fight and measure that effect.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.422
I think you can look at World War II. You see, both of 
these things have a trade-off. If I send a unit, and

27:49.086 --> 27:55.553
I want to use a National Guard unit for an example, 
and this happened in Pennsylvania... If you send a

27:57.018 --> 28:02.148
guard unit who was in the same town, trained 
together, and you kill them all on the same day,

27:57.018 --> 28:02.148
you've killed a town. But they work together. 
There's other way you send 160 guys, 167 guys on a

28:07.238 --> 28:12.368
plane, you dump them off in a unit. There's 167 
strangers standing there. Who cares? There are

28:16.236 --> 28:17.298
risks each way. I think the biggest... Gain is the 
stability. And I think it far outweighs what

28:21.142 --> 28:26.109
happens to one town or one group of people who've 
worked together. I think you perform better if

28:26.129 --> 28:31.257
everybody knows exactly what the other guy is 
going to do when the shove comes. There's no

28:31.698 --> 28:32.519
question. Old Smith's going to be out there 
hanging on because he's always hung on. It's not

28:36.805 --> 28:38.828
what is Old Smith going to be doing.

28:42.634 --> 28:47.922
American firepower, did we use it effectively in 
Vietnam? Did we just... Nah. We bound the wrong

28:50.469 --> 28:51.711
things. We had the fire powers misutilized. We 
used indiscriminate shooting. An example, we

28:59.462 --> 29:03.308
have a thing called H&I fire harassment and 
interdiction. You pick out a grid, they call the

29:05.251 --> 29:10.159
intel types like myself, and said, you got 
anything out there you'd like shot? We're going to

29:10.459 --> 29:12.402
fire 400 rounds tonight. Just spray the area and 
hope some fool walking down the road with his

29:13.057 --> 29:20.105
bicycle and bag of rye steps into the incoming.

29:23.829 --> 29:27.013
We had restrictions on where you could use this 
immense firepower. Towns were off limits.

29:31.558 --> 29:35.823
We prescribed a large set of circumstances.

29:38.086 --> 29:39.768
I think they were noble in description. However, 
the practical effect in the field was kill your own

29:39.808 --> 29:42.591
men. Uh, before I left the advisory program, 1970, 
we had a directive, uh, directive number one,

29:44.275 --> 30:00.215
1970, MACV1 or whatever it was, that said we could 
not fire on the enemy until fired upon, literally

29:44.275 --> 30:00.215
that. If they're on one side of the road and you're 
on the other and they don't shoot at you, you let

30:01.636 --> 30:05.541
them come through.

30:09.014 --> 30:38.548
my reply to that one will be yes sir we signed that 
gentleman and now let's go fight a war

30:09.014 --> 30:38.548
if you don't shoot them when you see them and i live 
over it i want to have a chat with you because it's

30:09.014 --> 30:38.548
just that's not at least my book how you do business 
but the army made that policy you you had the

30:09.014 --> 30:38.548
helicopters immense firepower do we use it we said 
we can't use it here we can't use it there you can't

30:09.014 --> 30:38.548
bring this to bear what we did was we ran the army by 
political decisions. And let's be fair, all

30:42.994 --> 30:45.779
armies answer to political leaders. In our case, 
three layers of civilians, the president, the

30:47.762 --> 30:55.255
secretary of defense, the secretary of the army, 
and the other services.

31:10.827 --> 31:13.915
So, lean back from the rock face. That's the 
instruction that always creeps me out. I would

31:16.763 --> 31:17.265
be... I don't have to finish that. But they always 
say, lean back from the rock face. And I, uh-uh.
