00:02.748 --> 00:10.421
Today's interview is with James Harvey Kattis, 
retired associate professor of mechanical

00:02.748 --> 00:10.421
engineering at Texas A&M University. Today's 
date is August 2, 1982. Let's begin, Professor

00:13.986 --> 00:21.919
Kattis, by you telling us something about your 
early years. Where were you born? Oh, I was born in

00:23.863 --> 00:26.868
the town of Winona, Mississippi. Where is that? 
That's in the north central part of Mississippi,

00:28.955 --> 00:36.642
about 100 miles north of Jackson, right in the 
middle of the state. What year were you born? In

00:40.026 --> 00:41.327
1911.

00:43.509 --> 00:46.692
What was your father's occupation? My father's 
occupation, he was a farmer, he was a railroad

00:46.712 --> 00:58.303
woman, he was a night watchman and he spent his last 
years running a little store. He had a little

01:07.039 --> 01:26.923
one-horse store and about three miles out from 
town he conceived that that was a good place for a

01:07.039 --> 01:26.923
store and he opened up a store there and ran it for 
about 27 years till he was some 83 years old and had

01:07.039 --> 01:26.923
to give it up. What was the population of Winona 
back in the 20s when you were a child? About 3,000.

01:33.087 --> 01:36.831
What about your mother? Did she work or was she a 
housewife? She was a housewife. Did you graduate

01:41.978 --> 01:44.481
from high school in Winona? Yes. How did you get 
from Winona to Texas A&M? Oh, I hitchhiked. What

01:51.509 --> 01:53.772
caused you to decide to come to Texas A&M? I'd heard 
about it, and then I had the option of going to

01:55.895 --> 02:06.871
Mississippi State, which is in Starksville, 
which is in Mississippi A&M. And student labor was

02:08.152 --> 02:11.958
for 15 cents an hour there. Over here, it was 25 
cents an hour.

02:19.909 --> 02:24.636
Why did you decide to study engineering?

02:26.287 --> 02:41.278
I had always been mechanically inclined and I had 
worked one summer in an ice plant in my hometown and

02:26.287 --> 02:41.278
I liked to see machinery run and like to take over 
things and make them run. What year did you

02:43.663 --> 02:46.790
graduate from high school? 1928. And you came then 
to A&M and graduated with a bachelor's degree in

02:47.667 --> 02:53.415
1932. That's correct. You stayed here four years. 
Right. You were in the Corps at the time. Right.

02:59.062 --> 03:00.224
Which was mandatory. Right. What were your 
impressions of being in the Corps at this? Oh, it

03:06.152 --> 03:08.996
was quite a normal thing. I took a pride in it, got a 
reserve commission out of it, and... I recommend

03:17.418 --> 03:19.580
it to anybody right now.

03:22.943 --> 03:32.612
What were some of the experiences that you had here 
at Texas A&M as a student down at graduate level?

03:32.632 --> 03:34.714
What were some of the highlights of your time? One 
of the highlights of my time here was that I

03:34.734 --> 03:44.083
remember the work I did on the side, much more 
really than I do the course work. The course work, I

03:49.378 --> 03:56.148
was able to take in stride and not get behind on it. 
And that 25 cents an hour helped keep my head and

03:56.168 --> 04:01.655
soul intact. What was something you had to do? Oh, I 
had to put in the foundry. I had to put in the, what do

04:08.064 --> 04:12.670
you call it, the steam lab over there. The 
mechanical engineering shop building was new in

04:13.088 --> 04:18.714
those days. After we got through building on 
those, the original installation and everything

04:18.734 --> 04:25.921
was in operation. Then I got to doing cabin 
network. Of course, a little while earlier, I'd

04:28.744 --> 04:35.131
done a little plumbing work, too.

04:35.151 --> 04:39.616
While you were here working on your master's 
degree, you had a great impression of the city.

04:39.636 --> 04:41.037
What were your impressions of the area? Well, you 
took it in stride, but when I graduated, the only

04:42.080 --> 05:00.392
way in 1932, the only way you wanted to get a job was 
to have a pull like your father was on the board of

04:42.080 --> 05:00.392
directors of some company or something of the 
sort. You didn't get just ordinary jobs. I was one

05:04.960 --> 05:13.230
that was selected by the General Electric Company 
for a job, but they said, we just put you on hold. We

05:14.231 --> 05:16.194
can't put you to work right now. And there they 
meant it. Instead of putting some to work, they let

05:22.161 --> 05:26.987
off some safety one Young engineers that had been 
with them one or two years up in Schenectady, where

05:27.153 --> 05:34.602
I would have worked. Later they did offer me a job, 
but I was otherwise employed. When you were a

05:41.289 --> 05:47.136
senior at A&M in 1932, were there any recruiters 
who came on campus? No. Not like later times? No. No

05:51.842 --> 05:53.644
recruiters. You'd go out and hunt a job. Did many of 
the people in your class have difficulty finding

05:57.157 --> 06:03.864
jobs as engineers? All of them did. The only way a 
fella could get a job then was to have a pull, to have

06:04.404 --> 06:15.676
somebody who was in a supervisory capacity and 
could put you in. What did most of the students do

06:15.696 --> 06:20.421
when they couldn't find jobs as engineers? I had 
one student who, in the name of Porter, that went

06:20.441 --> 06:26.607
back to His hometown of Belkin started running the 
billing station. He was working in the billing

06:33.287 --> 06:35.049
station. Later on, he became the owner of the 
billing station or the contract mobile station.

06:42.938 --> 06:46.703
Later on, he was mayor of the town and a good many 
other things. I've lost track of him, but I had

06:46.723 --> 06:51.308
another one by the name of Charlie Young. He went 
back and did the same old sort of thing in the town of

06:51.329 --> 06:56.695
Kyle and ended up with As a contractor at a hardware 
store, they did what they had to. They did what they

07:05.955 --> 07:07.258
should do. What did you decide to do after your 
graduation? Oh, that summer I went up and I was

07:11.726 --> 07:17.957
going to get... General Electric put me to work at 
some capacity, so long as I keep body and soul

07:18.393 --> 07:28.969
intact, I want to go to work and get some 
experience. But

07:28.989 --> 07:36.621
when I got up to Schenectady, I hitchhiked up 
there. I found that they just laid off those 71

07:37.681 --> 07:44.810
young engineers that had been there just ahead of 
us. Any number of those would have stayed under the

07:44.830 --> 07:49.817
same conditions that I would have gone to work for 
them. So, no job then. But I lucked into a job as an

07:53.182 --> 08:04.116
athletic director, bus driver on General Flunky 
and a girl's camp in Peterborough, New Hampshire.

08:04.136 --> 08:07.080
And I spent that summer in Peterborough, New 
Hampshire. Well, yes. I stayed

08:09.109 --> 08:18.021
there eight weeks. And I made enough money to buy me 
a motorcycle. And I took a shortcut on up to Quebec

08:25.452 --> 08:38.130
and St. Anne de Beaupré and on up the river there and 
came back down through Vermont. back down to New

08:38.515 --> 08:43.520
York, Washington, going back home. And I got a 
temporary job in my hometown, and after so long a

08:43.540 --> 08:56.052
time, I got an offer from Professor Crawford, who 
was head of mechanical engineering, to come back

08:43.540 --> 08:56.052
over. I thought he'd get me into the graduate 
assistant. Well, I came over considerably early.

09:04.975 --> 09:09.189
And I went back to my job of doing cabinet work. What 
did you start as a director, Susan? In the fall of

09:14.165 --> 09:17.415
1933.

09:18.813 --> 09:36.747
Professor Crawford

09:18.813 --> 09:36.747
apparently helped a lot of students get

09:18.813 --> 09:36.747
situated in graduate system type jobs and so 
forth. Is that true? That is certainly true. I've

09:37.529 --> 09:38.130
talked with him a number. He said he did tremendous 
labor by helping them get situated. Then you

09:39.957 --> 09:46.426
finished up your master's science degree in the 
summer of 1934. It took you one year to teach. It

09:49.450 --> 09:51.513
took me 12 months. You were teaching half-time 
while you were doing that. What were you teaching

09:55.839 --> 09:56.920
in graduate school? I taught what we called 
engineering problems. It was then a required

10:00.425 --> 10:04.190
course for freshmen. For freshmen, yes. What were 
some of your experiences as a graduate

10:07.058 --> 10:19.719
teaching assistant

10:07.058 --> 10:19.719
in the 1930s? Oh, it was a pleasant, challenging 
work. It was methodical. It was teaching and

10:27.171 --> 10:30.957
reading the paper. It was the only part of it that 
wasn't a real pleasure. I've always been able to

10:34.345 --> 10:37.328
work and made a great paper. There's more than just 
a few. What was the subject of your master's

10:40.913 --> 10:44.557
thesis? The subject of my master's thesis was kill 
drying certain Texas hardwood for cabinet

10:44.577 --> 10:53.267
use. Why must you search

10:53.287 --> 10:56.911
it? I worked on it about one season. actually

11:00.451 --> 11:19.135
we had a kill and we were getting this post oak 
lumber and walnut and some more local lumbers and

11:00.451 --> 11:19.135
we had to kill dry that and the question was how to 
kill dry it. And we experimentally took the thing

11:19.739 --> 11:41.091
on as not only a project to kill dry the wood, but to 
control the conditions within the kiln so that you

11:19.739 --> 11:41.091
had an increasing temperature and an increasing 
relative humidity in the kiln. And if you didn't

11:41.111 --> 11:46.759
control it just right, this post-oak will turn 
blue. turned into a material that is so hard that

11:47.228 --> 12:00.404
you're running, you're running saw just to cut a 
piece of board in

11:47.228 --> 12:00.404
two. What did you do after you completed your 
master's science degree? I went to work with the

12:05.671 --> 12:10.917
Gulf Oil, Gulf Oil Refinery in Fort Hoffa.

12:11.438 --> 12:12.780
That was in 1944, right. How did you happen to find a 
job somewhere in the family? Well, with a master's

12:15.477 --> 12:21.505
degree and the jobs, we were getting to open up a 
little bit. And I had some sum of $100 a month while

12:21.525 --> 12:26.552
they employed us. So you weren't there for seven 
years? No. I worked there about a year and a half.

12:31.338 --> 12:33.220
Where was this? Port Arthur. Port Arthur. What 
happened after that? In contrast with that, see,

12:39.428 --> 12:44.455
I'd kept up my commission in the reserves. And I was 
just on the verge of promotion to first

12:44.755 --> 12:51.583
lieutenant. The first lieutenant got $173 and 
some cents with pay and allowances. And that

12:59.774 --> 13:07.864
contrasted considerably with my $100 salary, 
which they were holding. And they were going to

13:07.884 --> 13:11.488
give raises, but they never had to get around to it. 
Yeah, that was 1935. I

13:17.671 --> 13:29.863
went on active duty with the Army in command of a 
Civilian Conservation Corps camp. Well, I was

13:30.304 --> 13:40.013
first over near Rusk, and then I was over in Milam. 
Milam is where I commanded you. The CCC,

13:42.232 --> 14:00.573
it happened, was a real fortunate thing for the 
country, outside of two or three reasons. One was

14:00.593 --> 14:08.121
it took a bunch of young men who were unemployed 
otherwise, I'm not talking about the reserve

14:08.978 --> 14:12.781
officers and all that commanded them, but it 
applied to them too. But the rank and file of the

14:13.502 --> 14:37.483
trainees in the CCC camp were young men who went in 
there and they learned how to drive trucks, they

14:13.502 --> 14:37.483
learned how to drive bulldozers, they learned how 
to make roads, build fences, do all sorts of

14:13.502 --> 14:37.483
things, and they learned how to cook, make, be an 
incumbent clerk, and each one of those things, in

14:38.864 --> 14:54.960
effect, made a cadre of people who were available 
for the United States Army, not by direct

14:38.864 --> 14:54.960
transfer, but by individual transfer. When World 
War II came along, along about that same time, our

14:55.600 --> 15:04.669
standing army was 125,000.

15:06.455 --> 15:12.444
now a million and a quarter

15:06.455 --> 15:12.444
or more. Had it not been for a reserve

15:13.024 --> 15:30.910
cadre of people out of the CCC camp, which was 
nearly triple the size of the standing army, we

15:13.024 --> 15:30.910
couldn't have mobilized the force if we did it 
nearly so quickly. Those

15:31.835 --> 15:47.761
camps

15:31.835 --> 15:47.761
all had a definite mission. Some of them were 
forest camps, reforestation. They would go in and

15:50.626 --> 15:58.939
make roads through the forest to serve for 
transportation and also for fire lanes. and they

15:59.594 --> 16:26.648
built watchtowers for lookout towers for fires 
and did some actual reforestation and they then

15:59.594 --> 16:26.648
they had camps that uh some of them uh well you take 
up here to fort parker and uh just this side of my ham

16:27.050 --> 16:29.995
They went in there and built a state park. They 
built a dam on the Navasota River, and there's a big

16:31.117 --> 16:42.836
lake in there now, a recreation facility, and all 
the camp, places you can go and camp. It's a

16:43.637 --> 16:47.924
recreation facility, a good big one. There are 
others that were soil conservation camps. They

16:51.856 --> 17:08.556
went in and actually did the terracing, did the 
survey work, the terracing and whatnot to make

16:51.856 --> 17:08.556
maximum use of rainfall and control soil erosion.

17:10.979 --> 17:13.002
And a good many others. They were all in there for a 
definite purpose, and they were...

17:21.877 --> 17:24.220
The public didn't resent those at all. And there 
was enough discipline. Those boys went out and

17:27.845 --> 17:30.088
actually worked. In those days, when a man worked, 
he worked.

17:37.759 --> 17:43.046
We hear impressions of Franklin Roosevelt. Much 
better then than now.

17:52.471 --> 18:03.246
I found later that some of the big improvements 
that he made in the banking facilities, you know,

17:52.471 --> 18:03.246
banks all went broke. Not all of them, but a great 
number of banks went broke. They closed the doors

18:08.153 --> 18:12.859
and all back in the Great Depression. A great many 
of those big improvements were actually the

18:13.430 --> 18:20.259
fruits of Herbert Hoover. President Hoover had a 
great many of those things going, but when

18:20.279 --> 18:38.965
Franklin Roosevelt became president, the 
furthest thing in the action there was to give

18:20.279 --> 18:38.965
credit to the prior administration, which had 
been Republican. And the other thing is that under

18:40.396 --> 18:59.199
the Roosevelt administration, socialism began 
in this country as never before, and it's still

18:40.396 --> 18:59.199
going.

18:59.219 --> 19:07.770
One

18:59.219 --> 19:07.770
is this business of make work by the government. 
Fortunately, in those days, the country was in a

19:09.927 --> 19:24.440
mood where when you made some work by the people who 
worked, and the WPA worked, it was far less

19:09.927 --> 19:24.440
efficient than the CCC. But nonetheless, they did 
some good jobs. But it came into the fact that it got

19:28.284 --> 19:37.572
out of the way, the fact that a person

19:38.767 --> 19:53.669
Each man was an individual, each circumstance was 
an individual circumstance, and the government

19:38.767 --> 19:53.669
was obliged to go in and take care of everybody.

19:53.689 --> 20:04.705
It has gradually progressed until people are not 
permitted to be poor, if you know what I mean. I

20:04.725 --> 20:08.250
believe the good book says the poor shall inherit 
the earth, They certainly have, but in contrast,

20:09.378 --> 20:27.205
they're why

20:09.378 --> 20:27.205
it's got to the point now that if they get enough 
handouts, they won't work.

20:27.225 --> 20:34.356
You're not about to hire a fellow on a menial job 
who's on this welfare kick. You might lose it. In

20:38.008 --> 20:44.256
retrospect, do you think that Pergator got a bum 
rap from the Depression? To a considerable

20:44.277 --> 20:47.741
extent, yes. Do you think that Roosevelt took 
credit for things that he really possibly wasn't

20:47.761 --> 20:54.731
responsible for? That's true. Now, I'm not saying 
he didn't do a lot of good things. He did, here and

21:01.204 --> 21:02.726
here. And some of the things that Hoover was not 
able to legislate

21:03.427 --> 21:13.640
for the simple fact that he didn't have a majority 
in Congress. Why, Roosevelt got in there, and

21:14.882 --> 21:24.694
bingo, why, banks closing and everything 
happening there, why, he could get most anything

21:14.882 --> 21:24.694
through Congress. Do you remember the elections 
of 32

21:25.484 --> 21:32.680
and 36? I do. After you left the CCC town, what did 
you proceed to do? I went to work with the George G.

21:38.153 --> 21:42.142
Fix Company in Dallas. In Dallas? No, the name of 
the company. What type of company was that?

21:52.938 --> 21:53.519
Correction. Is there? Correction. That's my 
second job. The first job I got was one of adjusting

21:58.388 --> 22:06.502
automobile insurance claims for General Motors. 
Where? in the southwest region, Texas. I was in

22:13.111 --> 22:18.070
Houston, Nacogdoches, Corpus Christi, And I 
worked through this territory. How long did you go

22:21.646 --> 22:23.568
back? About a year and a half. And then you went to 
the fixed company? And then I went to the fixed

22:26.951 --> 22:28.793
company. I want to get back to engineering. Okay. 
That's what I was trying to do. Okay. It is an

22:33.097 --> 22:34.419
engineering company. Is it still in existence? 
Yes. What type of engineering work did you do? I was

22:39.944 --> 22:44.909
doing sales engineering on mechanical power 
transmission equipment. What was the money you

22:45.009 --> 22:46.551
made from those? Chains. Both V-belts, 
couplings, bearings, belts. I mentioned

22:55.183 --> 22:56.386
V-belts. You were selling these to Cummings. Yes. 
It was a sale. And more often than not, you had to go

23:00.676 --> 23:10.411
out and tell a man what he needed because he was 
there ready to buy, but he didn't know what he

23:00.676 --> 23:10.411
needed to buy. He didn't really know what he needed 
to buy, so you had an engineering project right

23:10.471 --> 23:17.361
there free for nothing. But nonetheless, if you 
were going to sell merchandise, you had to sell him

23:17.381 --> 23:27.156
the correct merchandise, and then you gradually 
build up on it. And you went to Dix County from 38 to

23:29.279 --> 23:33.986
41? No, I was from 37, I'd say. I guess about 37 there 
until about 39. Then what? I came back here and they

23:51.385 --> 23:56.010
got me to working part-time on A&M. I came back here 
and my father-in-law, who was an attorney,

23:56.651 --> 24:08.845
I married in 1935.

24:09.326 --> 24:14.912
I was working in Port Arthur, but I came up here to 
marry. My father-in-law was an attorney. He was an

24:17.855 --> 24:22.199
attorney here, and he was an attorney and a 
surveyor. It was a combination. People did a lot of

24:25.242 --> 24:28.745
things in those days. And

24:29.006 --> 24:42.098
he had a flock of surveying that people wanted 
done, and he couldn't possibly do it all himself.

24:44.305 --> 24:55.382
He said, if you'll just

24:44.305 --> 24:55.382
stay here, you can work indefinitely. So I came 
back in, I worked indefinitely for Spell, and it

24:55.402 --> 25:04.816
turned out after a while that my main client was 
A&M. And come the fall, come the summer of 1940,

25:12.892 --> 25:20.667
Professor Crawford said, we need, we need you as a 
teacher out here to come back and join us full time.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.270
So I did. Been there until 1967 with military 
service in World War II. Right. Okay. And four

25:28.743 --> 25:34.714
years of working with A&M over in once and a half 
Bangladesh.

25:37.613 --> 26:04.836
These Pakistanis,

25:37.613 --> 26:04.836
through the foreign aid program, they got 
universities in Texas or in the United States to

25:37.613 --> 26:04.836
contract with universities in foreign countries 
to go in there and help them to upgrade their

25:37.613 --> 26:04.836
program and just generally aid, coordinate, 
whatever you could with them. And Texas A&M had a

26:05.255 --> 26:13.926
contract with the universities over in what was 
then East Pakistan. It's now Bangladesh. They had

26:16.890 --> 26:22.858
a war of separation over there.

26:22.918 --> 26:32.410
So I was over there from 1948 to 19... 1944 to 1948 as 
part of A&M State. Okay. You were at 8 a.m. from 40 to

26:33.929 --> 26:39.897
42, and then you left with the armed forces. I was 
here one year, from 40 to 41, and then I went to the

26:39.917 --> 26:44.682
armed forces. You went to the armed forces before 
Pearl Harbor, right? What was the service that you

26:47.826 --> 26:50.930
were entering on? I got a nice little order instead 
of a draft. Oh, I was just ordered back to duty.

26:57.077 --> 26:57.638
Okay. Fort Monmouth, I had been in

26:58.327 --> 27:17.746
the field artillery, but they decided, that 
little order I got decided I was in the signal

26:58.327 --> 27:17.746
corps. So, I was in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. I was 
there for about Went up there to school, and they

27:24.483 --> 27:28.908
put me on the duty station. And then they took me off 
of that and put me back to school. And then when

27:32.552 --> 27:43.524
Pearl Harbor came, I got ordered to Port of 
Embarkation in San Francisco, and they didn't

27:32.552 --> 27:43.524
want me to ever run to port. I was right at Pearl 
Harbor.

27:48.270 --> 27:51.233
And I was in the China, Burma, India theater. and 
what you did was the nature of your service. I was in

27:59.883 --> 28:08.697
command of, first, the fixed station radio 
communication. And then there was a team, and then

28:08.717 --> 28:21.777
there was a bunch of those teams that were thrown 
together and made into the signal service

28:08.717 --> 28:21.777
battalion, and I inherited the command of that. 
And

28:22.853 --> 28:40.043
that was, that was a highlight of, I was over 31 
months in that foreign service

28:22.853 --> 28:40.043
there. You were discharged at 4 o'clock? Yeah. You 
came back at 8 a.m. and you entered this, uh... I

28:45.972 --> 28:56.570
came back from overseas in 1944

28:45.972 --> 28:56.570
and spent my last nine months. I went to advanced 
signal school in Fort Montenegro. I got ordered to

29:01.619 --> 29:09.432
Nashville, Tennessee, the Affair General 
Hospital. T-H-A-Y-E-R. It was a 3,500-bed

29:11.945 --> 29:21.819
hospital that they were bringing people back to 
overseas. And

29:22.039 --> 29:35.638
after they began reduction in forces, well, I had 
my I'm trying to hang on, and I didn't want to hang

29:36.007 --> 29:47.963
on, so I came back to A&M while the time was good. 
When we were ordered to active duty, we didn't

29:47.983 --> 29:56.193
actually get a leave of absence that was 
expressed.

29:56.754 --> 30:04.444
It was implied, but when they needed me, I got busy 
and came back. Well, that was in 45, 45,

30:04.964 --> 30:14.955
46. So that was the spring of 46 was my first 
semester to teach

30:16.717 --> 30:27.529
after the war service. And then I went from 46 on 
until 1954, before that four years

30:27.897 --> 30:40.072
of augmentation. But, uh, how are you able to send 
to my location? Well, I've been over in that area in

30:43.977 --> 30:52.808
World War II, and they asked me if I would go back 
over there since I was familiar with the customs.

30:54.762 --> 31:03.635
And the general situation needed someone of the 
qualifications that it seemed I had. So we carried

31:05.038 --> 31:10.446
on with it. Did your wife want you to go? Well, she 
went with me. She went with me those four years.

31:23.692 --> 31:27.239
Well, to me it had become a routine thing. To her it 
was. She went through the cultural shock and Now we

31:35.127 --> 31:45.722
talk freely about what goes on over there, and 
before, I had the experience, and she couldn't,

31:35.127 --> 31:45.722
because you can't conceive, really. You see a lot 
of stuff on the TV, you know, but you can't really

31:46.543 --> 32:02.485
conceive the conditions and the people and how 
they exist and the difference between the

31:46.543 --> 32:02.485
ordinary people and the educated people and the 
government, the politicians. You've got three

32:03.241 --> 32:05.424
different levels. Common, poor people. Then 
you've got the ordinary people that are educated,

32:07.947 --> 32:17.879
middle-class people, and some of them are 
high-class, too. And then you've got the

32:17.899 --> 32:31.695
government

32:17.899 --> 32:31.695
bureaucrats or the autocrats, in this case might 
be the politicians.

32:34.274 --> 32:41.382
So when you see something on the news about 
Bangladesh, do you know more about it than comes to

32:34.274 --> 32:41.382
the other person around your house? Well, some 
truth. Do you have any problem with the language?

32:49.391 --> 32:50.512
We're talking English. I learned a little of the 
language. I learned a little of the language when I

32:53.756 --> 32:58.081
was over there in World War II. What? No, you've got 
many languages over there. Bengali

33:04.683 --> 33:19.944
is the language of some hundred million people in 
that general area.

33:19.964 --> 33:29.998
People who speak Bengali, they don't have too much 
overlap between that and people who speak Hindi,

33:19.964 --> 33:29.998
or the people who speak Urdu, or the people who... 
When I was there in World War II, the money was in the

33:30.232 --> 33:35.440
British India. British India, which didn't 
include all of the areas, it included the bulk of

33:37.063 --> 33:44.355
them. The money they had was in groupie notes. A 
little note, one rupee note was small. Five rupees

33:51.737 --> 33:54.160
was a little bigger. Ten rupees was bigger. Twenty 
rupees was still bigger. A hundred rupees would be

33:58.085 --> 34:03.070
like bed sheets.

34:05.914 --> 34:14.123
Everything bigger than a one rupee note had eight 
written languages on it. There's eight written

34:14.143 --> 34:15.645
languages. Now here's some 400 dilators 
scattered all

34:17.026 --> 34:27.401
over. What did she exactly do? I taught classes, 
and I consulted with the principal, who was the

34:30.593 --> 34:46.092
same as the president of the institution, and with 
the head of the mechanical engineering

34:30.593 --> 34:46.092
department. We helped provide for them some 
particular pieces of equipment, some

34:46.112 --> 34:52.319
literature. I wrote one book while I was there, and 
one more. on engineering problems. And the idea

35:02.246 --> 35:21.085
was to get an elementary book in there that would 
bring together to a more or less common foundation

35:02.246 --> 35:21.085
a diversity of backgrounds that these students 
had who got there. Some of them were ready to go

35:21.265 --> 35:29.794
ahead with a little bit higher work, and some of 
them were not. The bulk of them needed to, the

35:30.550 --> 35:38.658
education, the higher education, they were in 
English, in engineering, and still is. And

35:40.960 --> 35:48.747
they couldn't speak and handle the language well 
enough to get on with it. They needed some

35:48.767 --> 35:56.895
elementary, fundamental problems where you come 
down to what's given, what's required, and

35:57.179 --> 36:03.148
present the solution in an orderly, step-by-step 
fashion. A&M

36:03.168 --> 36:15.587
was involved in that because A&M was one of the land 
grant institutions.

36:16.088 --> 36:21.837
We were recognized to have a substantial 
engineering and agricultural capability and

36:22.778 --> 36:41.766
it's in those two prime areas that they were 
helping these countries so-called third world

36:22.778 --> 36:41.766
countries

36:22.778 --> 36:41.766
and you came back

36:45.020 --> 37:05.442
We have one

36:45.020 --> 37:05.442
son.

37:05.759 --> 37:13.008
And the year we went over there, he was a freshman at 
A&M, and he stayed here and went through his

37:05.759 --> 37:13.008
freshman year. Then he had ambition to go over 
there too, so he went over there and attended

37:13.569 --> 37:19.336
college. He didn't credit for it, but he attended 
college for the better part of a year and took

37:19.356 --> 37:30.990
courses and went to the University of Dhaka. And 
then he came back here and went on to graduate

37:32.978 --> 37:39.708
at the A&M University. Okay, you came back in 58. 
You were associate professor of mechanical

37:41.911 --> 37:47.320
engineering when you came back. And you held that 
position until you retired in 1979. What type of

37:49.303 --> 37:53.569
research did you do in 58, 57, and 68? I did not do 
direct research. I was always loaded with guilt on

38:00.446 --> 38:06.191
teaching. And in addition to teaching here, the 
last nine months, I mean the last

38:06.212 --> 38:23.269
nine semesters that I've taught extension 
courses down at Kelly Air Force Base in San

38:06.212 --> 38:23.269
Antonio. You taught engineering problems or what 
else? Oh, I taught 28 different courses, I think.

38:34.498 --> 38:38.162
Did you teach all the undergraduates or graduates 
as well? I taught some graduate work. What were

38:42.007 --> 38:50.657
some of the changes that occurred at A&M when you 
came back from 58 into retirement in 76?

38:54.113 --> 39:02.986
Well, one of them was moving over to the new 
building from old Fermion Hall. You remember

39:05.109 --> 39:07.753
Fermion? You know where the industrial, the 
engineering technology offices are there now?

39:17.126 --> 39:18.248
You mean shops? Well, see, we had, that was the 
Fermier Building. Professor Fermier was one time

39:22.577 --> 39:30.508
the head, way back there, the head of the 
Mechanical Engineering Department. And after

39:30.808 --> 39:40.702
his death, that building was completed and named 
it for himself. F-E-R-M-I-E-R. Sometime after

39:42.224 --> 39:46.170
that, they completed the shop building. He was 
actually a great man and a great builder, and they

39:46.290 --> 40:02.596
put up the buildings in his time, and there was a lot 
of progress in mechanical engineering in that

39:46.290 --> 40:02.596
time, and they named the building for him. The shop 
building has never been named for

40:02.616 --> 40:09.227
anybody. I'm

40:10.388 --> 40:21.043
seeing changes in two directions. One is good and 
one is bad.

40:28.713 --> 40:35.603
The bad feature is that students

40:41.219 --> 40:47.987
not as serious as they

40:41.219 --> 40:47.987
used to be. Too many of them are pouring with a 
silver spoon in their mouth, and the old work ethic

40:48.007 --> 41:04.105
is not properly ingrained into them now that they 
get to college, and they're just a bunch of kids

40:48.007 --> 41:04.105
still in school. And the best students we ever had 
were those right after World War II that had been in

41:05.857 --> 41:13.485
the service. They called them GIs. And the GI 
student came back, and he had his hard knocks, and

41:16.608 --> 41:32.725
he had seen the difference between the officer 
rank and the enlisted rank, the difference in pay,

41:16.608 --> 41:32.725
and a lot of them had all gone out and got jobs in 
industry, and they saw the difference between

41:16.608 --> 41:32.725
them. and the bosses and the people and the 
workers. And they were downright, and they also

41:40.047 --> 41:45.094
were a few years older than the others. And the 
seriousness they had made them be the best

41:46.496 --> 41:51.743
students that we ever had. I've heard several of 
the things that I'm taught to say to that class of 46

41:51.963 --> 41:57.531
and 47 were, It was the best I'd ever seen. 46, 47, it 
extended right on up

42:01.056 --> 42:07.285
to... It sort of phased out, but that extended on up 
to about, oh, in the early 50s. I'd say

42:15.335 --> 42:24.227
in the matter of 53, we still were getting a lot of 
so-called GIs. We were getting them then that had

42:25.507 --> 42:35.059
been out working more, and some of them stayed in 
the Army

42:25.507 --> 42:35.059
a little bit longer. We had good students then, and 
they were not writer's students,

42:35.079 --> 42:47.734
but they were more

42:35.079 --> 42:47.734
diligent. Kind of like football, you know, you 
take an ordinary player who's got his heart set to

42:47.754 --> 42:54.923
do a job, You come a whole lot nearer to getting it 
done than some fellow that's got all sorts of

42:55.544 --> 43:07.639
ability and only half-hearted and 
half-professional.

43:07.659 --> 43:13.006
What about the changes that occur as a result of the 
Corps being made voluntary? You see, that effect

43:13.026 --> 43:19.374
on the university as well. That change, 
unfortunately or unfortunately as it may be,

43:26.307 --> 43:30.772
There's good and there's bad in that. I was part of 
the old army gang where everybody was required to

43:31.052 --> 43:47.151
be in there and I've seen, I've taught on through 
the time when only a quarter of the people were in

43:31.052 --> 43:47.151
the Corps. And the Corps is not for everybody and 
everybody's not for the Corps. If you take a fellow

43:53.577 --> 44:04.130
who has a disdain for the military, why, the Corps 
shouldn't have to put up with you. On the other

44:04.150 --> 44:19.568
hand, the training and discipline they get in the 
Corps is certainly a thing that has given Texas A&M

44:04.150 --> 44:19.568
graduates a reputation for personnel 
management, being able to get along with people

44:21.286 --> 44:26.552
and do things. But A&M has given a real reputation 
that the people from liberal arts schools or the

44:28.595 --> 44:43.713
schools that did not have military never got.

44:44.013 --> 44:51.242
Now, that period of change happened to coincide 
with the period of the 60s. in which you had all the

44:51.492 --> 45:07.273
Vietnam draft dodges, and all of the burning of the 
ROTCs in not A&M, thank goodness, but in Facebook,

44:51.492 --> 45:07.273
Columbia, you name it. A lot of those places where 
they went in and literally set fire to the ROTC

45:07.293 --> 45:17.787
buildings and did other damage. had all their 
parades. They did their thing out at Berkeley.

45:27.807 --> 45:45.023
And to the extent that that exists, why, I'd say the 
non-military is a bane on the, it's a bane on

45:27.807 --> 45:45.023
democracy.
