WEBVTT

00:05.617 --> 00:14.187
19 and 30, no 19 and 20, I believe, my father became a 
member of the Texas A&M University staff.

00:20.934 --> 00:24.338
And what was his position in the university? He was 
first a county agent in the extension service and

00:25.399 --> 00:34.830
before he retired he became director of the 
extension service. Okay, and where had you lived

00:36.093 --> 00:40.979
previously before, or where had they lived 
previously before they came here? In northeast

00:40.999 --> 00:42.060
Texas. In northeast Texas. I see.

00:50.150 --> 00:50.550
Okay. Could you give me your earliest 
recollections of the community, in other words,

00:51.351 --> 01:01.443
here in Bryan, what it looked like, how it was, you 
know, the landscape and the buildings and so on?

01:01.784 --> 01:05.408
Well, it was a very pleasant, small town where... 
Everybody knew everybody else, where everybody

01:05.675 --> 01:10.340
knew where everybody lives. Nobody ever paid 
attention to the names of the streets, they just

01:10.380 --> 01:18.227
said so and so lives three blocks on the other side 
of such and such a place. We had Allen Academy, it

01:18.267 --> 01:35.344
was called then, it's now called Allen School, and 
everybody was interested in the welfare of the

01:18.267 --> 01:35.344
boys there, and the students at A&M University, 
which was called A&M College at that time. Could

01:35.628 --> 01:45.965
you tell me a little bit about how large the 
community was at the time? Between 5,000 and 6,000

01:46.406 --> 01:49.170
people. Could

01:50.692 --> 02:02.732
you tell me a little bit about your school years, 
where you went to school and what the schooling was

01:50.692 --> 02:02.732
like then as compared to today? You mean a school 
here in Bryan? Right. Yes. We had one high school,

02:07.579 --> 02:15.289
and I believe we only had two elementary schools at 
that time. The elementary school was over on the

02:15.930 --> 02:25.463
west side of town, which was the old part of Bryan, 
and the other one was over here. We had only one high

02:26.084 --> 02:27.826
school. It was not anything like junior high, 
middle high and all, senior high and all that. It

02:31.990 --> 02:33.512
was just high school. Right. And it was four years. 
It was twelve, twelve grades then of school.

02:37.536 --> 02:37.857
Twelve grades. Right. Okay.

02:41.761 --> 02:49.529
Did, was it, were there very many in the school at, 
you know, when you went, where you were going or?

02:49.869 --> 02:53.994
Well,

02:49.869 --> 02:53.994
not a great many. I don't think we ever had more than 
thirty. But you didn't have, you had, in other

02:56.307 --> 03:04.120
words, a teacher for each grade and so on too? Yes. 
For all the classes, right?

03:09.829 --> 03:17.742
Did they, you also told me, or I know now that you are 
a librarian, how did you happen to choose this

03:09.829 --> 03:17.742
career? It's just what I always wanted to do. When I 
was 14 years old, I started working over in the old

03:21.018 --> 03:25.583
Carnegie Library building. From that moment, I 
knew that's what I wanted to do. Right. Okay. Could

03:31.150 --> 03:36.296
you relate a little bit of the history of the Bryan 
Library here, how it was established? Yes. When

03:38.979 --> 03:44.986
Bryan was first came into being, it was a pretty 
rough town. It was completely a town where an awful

03:47.995 --> 03:54.341
lot of people who didn't have any other place to go 
came. Roughnecks, wanderers, people who'd been

03:55.463 --> 04:00.688
kicked out of other places. There was actually a 
saloon on every corner. Hangings and lynchings

04:08.596 --> 04:13.561
and shootings were the rule of the day. But there 
also came into this community number of very

04:18.185 --> 04:24.614
cultivated people who had come from the Old South. 
They were people not only of wealth and influence,

04:24.654 --> 04:31.123
but people who knew what to do with it. And 
prominent among these were some ladies who

04:32.705 --> 04:43.320
established what they called the Mutual 
Improvement Club. This was in 1897. The Mutual

04:47.817 --> 04:58.534
Improvement Club is now the most prestigious club 
in Bryan, which is the Bryan Women's Club. And

04:58.554 --> 05:11.395
among these ladies were Mrs. Alastair Waldrop 
Sr.,

04:58.554 --> 05:11.395
and Mrs. Rose Fountain Howell, and Mrs. George 
Brandon. And these ladies felt that Brian needed a

05:13.282 --> 05:17.368
number of things. There were over 4,000 people. 
There were almost 5,000 people in Brazos County at

05:20.954 --> 05:26.102
that time. And they decided that they were going to 
do something about the situation. Well, they had

05:32.613 --> 05:35.357
several goals which they put down. One of them was 
to get the cows off of Main Street. And another was

05:40.197 --> 05:42.400
to have a park. And the park, I may tell you, is this 
park right here where the library is at the moment.

05:47.948 --> 05:52.054
And the third thing they wanted to do was to have a 
free public library. And I may tell you in the

05:53.376 --> 06:03.851
beginning that in a very short while, just a matter 
of months, they had done all these things that they

05:53.376 --> 06:03.851
wanted to do. They pretty quick got the cattle off 
of Main Street. They took this piece of land and

06:08.665 --> 06:14.172
made it into a park, and they planted those oak 
trees. No, I think the oak trees were planted

06:14.753 --> 06:23.064
later, sometime after World War I as a memorial to 
the men in Brazos County who had been killed in the

06:14.753 --> 06:23.064
war. And then as for the library, these ladies, 
having their ears to the ground, heard that Andrew

06:24.466 --> 06:33.238
Carnegie was giving away millions of dollars 
establish libraries. This is really the most

06:34.951 --> 06:39.035
wonderful thing that ever happened for libraries 
in the United States. So Mrs., I

06:40.217 --> 07:00.778
think it was Mrs. Brandon who had some connection 
with Andrew Carnegie, and they wrote to Mr.

06:40.217 --> 07:00.778
Carnegie and told him that they would like to have a 
library in Bryan, and they pointed out all the

06:40.217 --> 07:00.778
reasons why they needed a library in Bryan. he 
wrote back immediately and said he would be

07:02.108 --> 07:29.618
pleased that was the word he used to give them a 
thousand dollars which they would use this money

07:02.108 --> 07:29.618
to build the building and that's what that 
building cost one thousand dollars under these

07:02.108 --> 07:29.618
terms that they the city would match this fund 
every year a thousand dollars to buy books to run

07:30.070 --> 07:33.237
the library, pay personnel. So the thing was 
accepted. And an interesting thing is to go there

07:36.604 --> 07:41.214
and look at the minutes of the city council in those 
years. And you find that many years they had to

07:41.294 --> 07:45.603
borrow money to keep their side of the bargain. But 
they did. So in 1903, on December the 14th, this

07:47.620 --> 07:53.148
library over here opened. It was the biggest day in 
Bryan's history up to that point. You can go back

07:57.355 --> 08:03.124
and read the Old Eagle and find out where everybody 
was on that day and what they were doing. And if they

08:03.144 --> 08:08.171
were not attending the library opening, well, you 
knew exactly why they couldn't. The way they got

08:10.715 --> 08:13.780
the books has always been interesting to me. Miss 
Malcolm McInnis, who was one of my high school

08:17.607 --> 08:20.811
teacher's father was on the faculty. He was on the 
first faculty at A&M. And he was also the first

08:23.495 --> 08:30.665
president of the library board, the old Carnegie 
building. And he lived over in one of those

08:30.785 --> 08:35.832
gorgeous Victorian mansions over on 29th Street. 
They tore it down now and made apartments out of it.

08:38.395 --> 08:39.316
I'm sorry to say. But he invited everybody in 
Brazos County to come to a party at his house. But to

08:44.924 --> 08:47.327
come to the party, you had to bring a book. So they 
all brought a book, and Miss Malcolm said that she

08:47.932 --> 08:52.636
remembers it. She said it was just like heaven 
descending upon earth to have all those books. And

08:56.901 --> 09:03.967
she used to sit for hours at the piano supposedly 
practicing, and all the while she had one of the

08:56.901 --> 09:03.967
books. And she just lived in fear that she wouldn't 
get all the books read before they took them out of

09:03.987 --> 09:08.572
the house and put them in the library. Well, over 
the years, of course, you know, the library's

09:10.333 --> 09:14.277
grown and grown and grown. We do have some of those 
original books in the collection now. You can go

09:19.209 --> 09:23.658
down and see that wonderful little handwriting on 
the cards that we still have. Books are still

09:24.700 --> 09:25.682
there. This library, I just arranged it so that 
when this library opened, I had it open on December

09:26.604 --> 09:31.654
the 14th. That's great. How long was the original 
building of the library here before it was

09:34.152 --> 09:42.062
reconstructed? You mean the building over there? 
Let's see, was the first library on this property

09:44.324 --> 09:47.688
here? No, the first library was the old one over 
here that's still there. Oh, I see. Okay. It's been

09:53.055 --> 09:54.356
there since 1903. Since 1903. And when was this 
building built here? Well, let me see. Maybe five,

10:02.553 --> 10:04.157
six years ago. Five or six years ago. OK. 1969, I 
believe, is when we opened, in December 1969. OK.

10:16.593 --> 10:19.257
You told me that you wanted to be a librarian. Where 
did you get your schooling? Well, I have a BA and an

10:21.880 --> 10:32.235
MA from the University of Texas at Austin, and I 
have an MS in Library Science from Louisiana State

10:21.880 --> 10:32.235
University.

10:36.500 --> 10:41.607
Do you know approximately how many volumes they 
had here in the library when they started out as

10:36.500 --> 10:41.607
compared to today? You mean the first library 
collection? I think it was a thousand books. Now we

10:47.170 --> 10:48.091
have 100,000. 100,000. That's

10:48.752 --> 10:55.583
great. Of course, I guess the Depression hit here 
as much as it did anywhere else in the United

10:55.603 --> 11:01.231
States. Could you describe how it affected your 
life or your lifestyle and maybe the people here in

11:01.912 --> 11:07.921
Vine?

11:10.866 --> 11:12.368
Well, as I remember, People here in Brown were not 
greatly affected by the Depression because their

11:13.968 --> 11:21.900
economy at that time depended upon the 
university.

11:25.606 --> 11:28.190
Life went all about as usual. Only thing I can 
remember about the Depression from my university

11:29.232 --> 11:35.622
days was that they kept having these Saturdays 
when you could go to the movies free. And we would

11:42.012 --> 11:47.441
all spend all day Saturday going to every movie 
house in Austin. Free movies.

11:55.735 --> 12:01.845
What changes in this community do you think have 
most affected its advancement and growth?

12:06.382 --> 12:12.992
People all over the country are finding that this 
is an extremely pleasant place to live. And there

12:13.032 --> 12:21.224
are just thousands of people who come into this 
community to live for no other reason than just

12:13.032 --> 12:21.224
that. The life is about as leisurely as it can be in 
these days. The people are kind, hospitable, and

12:29.804 --> 12:33.309
congenial. And of course, it is a college town. 
There's no getting away that I think for myself and

12:34.952 --> 12:45.308
for a lot of people that the pleasantest kind of 
place to live is a university town. I've never

12:45.328 --> 12:50.716
lived in any other, so I don't really know how it 
would be. Right. What recollections do you have of

12:51.404 --> 12:57.871
Texas A&M University as it grew over the years? Oh 
my. Or just a view of them in a way that's

12:59.573 --> 13:02.076
interesting? Well, from the time I first laid eyes 
on it, I remembered how it was, the university was

13:02.096 --> 13:18.795
founded, and it always amazed me to think that of 
all places in the world, now this is nothing but a

13:02.096 --> 13:18.795
little flat prairie out there. that this should be 
the first land-grant college in the United

13:20.176 --> 13:25.263
States, which it is. And it started out as with a few 
buildings, and Miss Malcolm told me also one time

13:27.786 --> 13:45.771
about how he had just married this beautiful, 
exquisite little dainty Mississippi belle and

13:27.786 --> 13:45.771
brought her to A&M. The train was late, so 
President Gathright had sent horse and buggy to

13:49.572 --> 13:57.968
pick them up and they got there, the train went 
there, so they went back. So when they came to get

13:59.010 --> 14:11.614
off, he stepped down and then he held out his hand 
and let her step down and she put her lovely little

13:59.010 --> 14:11.614
foot right into a big mud hole. And she lifted up her 
skirts and she looked around in amazement. She

14:14.810 --> 14:17.874
couldn't see anything except miles and miles of 
prairie. And she said, Major McInnes, where is the

14:17.894 --> 14:22.379
university?

14:31.490 --> 14:36.876
What kinds of fads and fashions were popular when 
you were growing up? Well, I can tell you that the

14:39.353 --> 14:45.783
main recreation for young people in this town was 
riding up and down Main Street. There was nothing

14:48.327 --> 14:51.172
to do except go to the movies. And it was only—well, 
there were three movie houses. Which ones were

14:56.861 --> 14:57.923
those? Do you recall? Oh, the Palace, the Queen, 
and the Dixie. The Dixie was where they had

15:02.750 --> 15:05.715
westerns.

15:06.893 --> 15:12.239
We had the second one that was at the Queen, and the 
first ones were at the Palace. Were the roads paved

15:14.382 --> 15:19.488
in this town at that time? Yes, but they had not 
always been. Mrs. Donna Carnage was telling me

15:23.073 --> 15:36.529
about the first paved street they got in Bryan was 
Main Street, and she said that on that day, it was on

15:23.073 --> 15:36.529
a Saturday morning, and her brother Walter 
Coulter. They elected a queen of the paving, can

15:40.285 --> 15:42.988
you believe it? A queen of the paving. And that was 
Frances James, she became. Karen's own of Jim

15:51.156 --> 16:05.470
Ferguson, and always went wherever he could to 
hear him, because he thought it was, of course, he

15:51.156 --> 16:05.470
knew as a renegade and all those things, but he was 
spectacular. eloquent oratory was interesting.

16:12.504 --> 16:13.906
Who exactly was Jim Ferguson? Was he a mayor here? 
No, no. He was governor of Texas twice, and he was

16:15.749 --> 16:19.033
impeached. He was, I guess, the only Texas 
governor who's ever been impeached. I know he was.

16:23.580 --> 16:35.237
So then he stepped right in and ran his wife for 
governor, and she used to call them all Ferguson,

16:23.580 --> 16:35.237
and she

16:23.580 --> 16:35.237
got elected.

16:38.744 --> 16:46.131
What natural disasters that occurred in this area 
do you remember, and how did they affect the people

16:38.744 --> 16:46.131
in the landscape?

16:53.197 --> 16:55.239
Well, there were several hurricanes. One of them I 
remember after I came here to be director of this

16:55.359 --> 17:08.110
library, and I know that all the refugees that 
lived in the library during that time. Oh, that was

17:08.461 --> 17:11.105
about 1969. Not 1969. More like 59, I think. Right. 
Were there any floods back in the earlier days,

17:20.277 --> 17:28.648
like in the Browns River that occurred, you know, 
during your time? Yes, long before my time,

17:28.668 --> 17:35.818
though.

17:37.992 --> 17:42.818
What role has religion played in this community, 
and how has it changed over the years? Every

17:44.340 --> 17:55.533
account that you read of the history of this area is 
that the churches and schools were in this town

17:44.340 --> 17:55.533
before the town was, right? The oldest churches in 
town, the Episcopal Church, the Baptist Church,

17:55.553 --> 18:06.767
Methodist, Presbyterian, and the Catholic 
Church. and the Christian Church. I think those

18:10.272 --> 18:15.959
are the ones that were first here, and they were all 
established about the same time. When was that

18:15.979 --> 18:21.025
approximately?

18:21.085 --> 18:21.405
1867.

18:24.830 --> 18:25.010
Okay. And over the years, you know, we've got many 
churches now. The Baptists have split into many,

18:28.834 --> 18:35.202
many sects. Just all you have to do on Sunday 
morning is try to go to church yourself, to get

18:35.620 --> 18:45.570
through the parked cars to get to your own church. 
Right.

18:50.074 --> 19:01.946
Do you think there were more people at that 
time—well, I don't know, maybe that's not a

18:50.074 --> 19:01.946
question to answer—that were more involved in 
religion and religious activities, possibly,

18:50.074 --> 19:01.946
than there are today? Yes, because—for this 
reason. Church was not only for church, but it was

19:06.147 --> 19:10.253
also for social. In the early days, the only social 
life people had was in the church. What kind of

19:16.243 --> 19:19.408
social activities were there? Well, singing, 
sacred heart singing,

19:19.668 --> 19:30.265
socials, and what they used to call dinner on the 
ground, meeting all day, dinner on the ground. In

19:32.236 --> 19:42.709
those that dance, there are some churches, you 
know, that dance, and others that don't, but

19:32.236 --> 19:42.709
dancing, the Episcopal Catholic Church for young 
people dances.

19:47.776 --> 19:53.383
What technological changes do you think have had 
the greatest impact on this area?

19:59.388 --> 20:00.971
I don't know, such as what? Well, like,

20:01.432 --> 20:15.759
I don't know, it could be like, such as, I don't 
know, maybe farm machinery or the... Well, of

20:01.432 --> 20:15.759
course, farm machinery. This is basically a 
ranching and... plantation area and has always

20:20.718 --> 20:35.094
been, but machinery that had to do with any of those 
occupations would have a great impact

20:20.718 --> 20:35.094
upon us. Most people, of course, I guess, were 
involved in agriculture during that time, right?

20:41.101 --> 20:44.745
That's all there was to do. Kids' stores. Do you 
know what the main crops were that were grown in

20:47.785 --> 20:52.231
this area? Cotton. This is one of the biggest 
cotton planting areas in the world. The Brazos

21:00.704 --> 21:13.422
Valley is supposed to be the richest, second maybe 
to

21:00.704 --> 21:13.422
Egypt. Do you think agriculture is still as 
important to this area as it was? Well, it's not as

21:19.224 --> 21:25.830
important as it was, but it's still certainly very 
important.

21:30.415 --> 21:37.962
How do you feel that—that Bryan or the community 
has—how has it most affected your life here? I

21:37.982 --> 21:41.625
don't know exactly. Let's see.

21:46.223 --> 21:52.451
or what attributes maybe of this community do you 
feel are important to you? I adore every inch of

21:52.932 --> 21:55.355
this town. I would never live anywhere else. You'd 
have to put me in jail to take me away from this town.

22:07.911 --> 22:09.733
Could you tell me something a little bit about the 
stores and the retail businesses here in town,

22:10.186 --> 22:22.498
some that were

22:10.186 --> 22:22.498
quite progressive or quite prominent here in 
Newtown? Well, Waldrop's has always been here,

22:22.558 --> 22:28.884
just the Brown Brand store has just gone out of 
business. They still have one at the college, and

22:28.905 --> 22:34.210
Eugene Edge on the corner is still here. Conway is 
an old store. Were these—are these department

22:40.493 --> 22:44.139
stores, or are these—? Waldrop's and Conway's are 
men's clothing stores, and Edge's is just that

22:45.281 --> 23:02.208
old—it's the only one in town—just an 
old-fashioned store where you can get

22:45.281 --> 23:02.208
everything, any way of clothing.

23:02.368 --> 23:02.468
Okay. Do you think that the growth of Bryan has had 
any negative aspects on the community? No. I think

23:13.165 --> 23:14.246
it's too big. It makes me unhappy that I don't know 
where everybody lives.

23:22.354 --> 23:28.940
You probably maybe have some friends or relatives 
that have lived here that have maybe moved out of

23:22.354 --> 23:28.940
this community. Is there any particular reason or 
one maybe general reason they've moved? from this

23:35.455 --> 23:36.708
area. I think that the main reason people move from 
Bryan is that they find, they think they will be, it

23:37.261 --> 23:50.394
would be more advantageous to them, usually in the 
way of money, to go somewhere else. I've never

23:51.655 --> 24:00.244
known but one person in all the years that I've 
lived in Bryan, that's a long time, who did not like

23:51.655 --> 24:00.244
it here, and who said so. This was a person from the 
cold Middle West. I see. And I may say they have now

24:08.823 --> 24:12.989
gone back to the cold middle class. But I've known 
many, many, many converted Yankees. We love it.

24:19.357 --> 24:25.986
Have, and I'm sure I guess a number of people have 
gone just because maybe the bigger towns have had

24:19.357 --> 24:25.986
more attraction? Yes. They, you know, in earlier 
days when the educational advantages weren't as

24:27.785 --> 24:40.082
great as they are here, they leave it other places 
to educate their

24:27.785 --> 24:40.082
children. Okay.

24:44.869 --> 24:46.671
Of course, let's see. housing I'm sure in the 
earlier days was quite different than it is now.

24:53.022 --> 24:56.006
They didn't use brick materials and so on to build 
houses. How do you think, what were the styles

24:56.507 --> 25:01.274
like, you know, then as compared to today? In 
architecture? Well, the favorite kinds of

25:04.799 --> 25:17.637
architecture here were

25:04.799 --> 25:17.637
Greek Revival, which is plantation style, and 
Victorian. We have several excellent examples of

25:18.292 --> 25:25.583
both of

25:18.292 --> 25:25.583
them. Okay. And they were, of course, the wooden 
frame, right? Two-story, mostly, weren't they?

25:31.611 --> 25:31.912
Yeah. The Aston brothers, who came here from 
Alabama to plant cotton, built two gorgeous brick

25:31.932 --> 25:47.995
houses, one on the inside of town, one over on Texas 
Avenue burned 50 years ago. And the other one is

25:48.667 --> 25:54.292
still, and it is a magnificent house. It's just 
been bought by somebody with a large family, I'm

25:54.372 --> 25:58.236
happy to say. It's over on the west side. When were 
those built in this area? Oh, long towards the turn

26:03.480 --> 26:11.708
of the century, after they had made their fortunes 
in cotton. Okay. Um, how do you, what do you feel is,

26:13.069 --> 26:17.813
uh, about the impact of the railroad in this area, 
as far as the transportation. Was it an important

26:28.117 --> 26:30.581
link to other towns and communities? Well, there 
had never been Brown except for the railroad. The

26:32.584 --> 26:38.113
railroad left Milliken and came to Brown, and that 
was when the town came into existence. Do you know

26:43.253 --> 26:45.095
when it, where was that? Well, let's see. It was in 
1967. 1967. Was it used a lot by the people here in

26:50.419 --> 26:55.244
Bryan to get to different communities 
everywhere? Totally, yeah. That was the only mode

26:55.564 --> 26:57.986
of transportation.

27:00.208 --> 27:00.588
Right, yeah. Okay. You told me earlier there was a 
lot of renegades and saloons in this area. what

27:09.953 --> 27:36.012
was when

27:09.953 --> 27:36.012
how long ago was that that was in the 1800s that

27:09.953 --> 27:36.012
was when in the earlier earlier days um There have 
been, I believe, a lot of different ethnic

27:37.882 --> 27:43.690
backgrounds of peoples that have moved in the 
series. Yes, very happily. I

27:44.711 --> 27:53.723
always get this question, and I like to say I'm 
proud of the fact that this community has always

27:44.711 --> 27:53.723
been integrated. This library has always been 
integrated. When the problem of using the library

27:57.777 --> 28:05.463
came, you know, whether black people could use the 
library, they had always been using the library.

28:06.484 --> 28:10.508
Had all the same privileges as anybody else. The 
Mexican-Americans have been a great influence on

28:10.528 --> 28:20.937
this, you know, to have given it that leisurely, 
graceful, and colorful influence that only they

28:10.528 --> 28:20.937
could give. We have

28:22.358 --> 28:27.362
a large bohemian Were

28:28.557 --> 28:38.692
these different ethnic people, were they here 
when you were living here also? Yes, they've

28:39.413 --> 28:41.416
always been here. There's also a larger number of 
Italians in this community.

28:53.914 --> 28:57.940
There's a large number of Italians.

29:02.155 --> 29:07.282
What were the, what was the A&M University like 
when you were growing up? Was there, of course,

29:07.322 --> 29:16.875
most, it was all male school at that time, and most, 
I guess all the men were in the corps, is that

29:07.322 --> 29:16.875
correct? Yes. Emphasis was definitely on the 
military. Right. And it was the most exciting

29:20.500 --> 29:24.986
place in the world for a girl to be. That was the 
other occupation, I may tell you, of young people

29:25.006 --> 29:31.555
was for girls to get in cars and go out to A&M and See 
the boys.

29:38.775 --> 29:56.327
How did—let's

29:38.775 --> 29:56.327
see—were there any particular—well,

29:38.775 --> 29:56.327
let's see, what—I

29:38.775 --> 29:56.327
was trying to think.

29:59.446 --> 30:12.507
You

29:59.446 --> 30:12.507
said that your father was at A&M.

30:15.432 --> 30:18.597
Was your mother the housewife then, I guess, 
right? My mother definitely objected to that

30:18.617 --> 30:21.341
terminology. Oh, she did? She was not a housewife. 
Oh, okay.
