You said being here.

00:06.250 --> 00:15.626
Being here in the A&M environment has really formed an even greater love for this university.

00:15.826 --> 00:22.798
The person that it has helped shape me into is really amazing.

00:22.778 --> 00:28.486
It makes me hold an even greater part of my heart to hold for A&M.

00:28.506 --> 00:42.445
And it's truly a blessing that I've been able to come here and go to school here and learn here and make friends here and leave the little footprint that I've been able to leave here at A&M.

00:42.646 --> 00:47.392
It's truly been a true gift, and I'm eternally grateful for that.

00:48.554 --> 00:49.495
That's a great ending.
