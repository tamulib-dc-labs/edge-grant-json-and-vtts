00:01.415 --> 00:02.657
This is Ryan Jorgensen. The date is November 18th, 
1985. We're in the Trigon at Texas A&M University

00:06.361 --> 00:10.306
in College Station. And today I'm interviewing 
Colonel Donald Burton about his experiences in

00:10.787 --> 00:15.973
Vietnam. Colonel Burton, can you tell me your 
birthplace and date? Yes, I was born in Waco,

00:18.557 --> 00:21.681
Texas, April 14th, 1935. Okay, thank you. And when 
were you stationed in Vietnam? I went to Vietnam on

00:25.345 --> 00:26.867
two occasions. The first time was in 1966 in 
Vietnam. in the spring. That was a temporary duty

00:34.890 --> 00:37.054
assignment. I went there with a team of people from 
a field artillery school, primarily to work on the

00:37.074 --> 00:51.823
maintenance situation with 8 inch and 175 
millimeter howitzers, which had a tremendous

00:37.074 --> 00:51.823
deadline rate. That means that they were 
inoperative. And our mission was to go over and

00:56.978 --> 01:07.180
find out why the weapon system was not doing well in 
Vietnam, and number two, to conduct classes on

00:56.978 --> 01:07.180
maintenance. parts supply and operation of the 
thing. That started out to be a two-week trip,

01:11.131 --> 01:16.556
which wound up being about a two-month stay. I see. 
And what was your second visit? Second was my

01:19.499 --> 01:21.261
assignment there. I went over with 41st Artillery 
Group in 1967. I see. What did you find with your

01:26.986 --> 01:29.568
weapons? Well, we found typically that the 
weapons were being poorly maintained. Parts

01:36.100 --> 01:50.953
supply system was not working properly at any 
level and there was quite a bit of abuse of the

01:36.100 --> 01:50.953
weapons system and it's just a typical thing, you 
know, you publish instructions and lessons

01:51.625 --> 01:57.353
learned on how to operate the system, but whether 
people read it or not is something else again. So

01:57.373 --> 02:03.061
it's very profitable because we cured that 
problem within a six-week period of time. Oh,

02:03.221 --> 02:04.203
that's good. I see. And how long was your second 
assignment? A year. One year. Yeah, I stayed a

02:08.008 --> 02:09.590
year. Okay. And what did that entail with the 41st? 
My assignment with the 41st Artillery Group, I was

02:12.915 --> 02:19.945
the group adjutant, which the group adjutant runs 
the administration, the personnel and the

02:20.347 --> 02:25.532
discipline systems for an organization. I spent 
six months with the 41st Artillery Group all over

02:25.552 --> 02:31.638
Vietnam because that group had nine battalions 
under it. And then became the S-1 or the personnel

02:31.878 --> 02:43.770
staff officer for 1st Field Force Artillery 
Headquarters, which is the core artillery

02:31.878 --> 02:43.770
headquarters station in Nha Trang. I see. What was 
our overall strategy in Vietnam? Well, that

02:50.283 --> 02:53.827
varies in what year you're talking about. When you 
were there, in 67? Well, basically in early days,

02:56.090 --> 02:59.313
our strategy was one of combat. We were attempting 
to engage both the PLA forces, or VC forces, if you

03:00.975 --> 03:11.728
will, and main force forces where we found them. So 
there was a considerable amount of what's called

03:15.899 --> 03:22.408
search and destroy missions and circumvent 
missions, forays, raids, the whole works. Also,

03:22.629 --> 03:39.593
there was a considerable effort in the mid-60s to 
do a lot of stabilization at the local level in

03:22.629 --> 03:39.593
support of the school systems, to assist in land 
reform, to assist in keeping the communication

03:22.629 --> 03:39.593
routes open, and so forth. And how successful were 
those? Well, it was very successful. I think

03:42.538 --> 03:44.100
that... On a localized basis now. You have to 
realize that on a national basis, we didn't have

03:46.415 --> 03:49.778
the same thing. If we had, you wouldn't have the 
continual collapse of governments that you saw.

03:54.864 --> 04:04.554
And it's very important to realize that

03:54.864 --> 04:04.554
what went on at the local level and what went on at 
the national level was two different things. And

04:04.954 --> 04:10.240
the tie-in between the two wasn't often good 
because we did not take over that country. We just

04:10.420 --> 04:14.104
tried to encourage their own government to 
establish itself and run it. And the biggest

04:14.573 --> 04:25.590
problem was what I call a political communication 
between the government of Saigon and on down to the

04:14.573 --> 04:25.590
states, the districts, the villages, and right on 
down. It's just a tremendously different thing.

04:28.294 --> 04:31.979
The government of Saigon was corrupt and 
inefficient? Well, I can't comment on being

04:32.280 --> 04:34.864
corrupt and inefficient. I think that when you say 
corrupt and inefficient, you're talking about

04:35.124 --> 04:41.915
Oriental governments in general, by our 
standards. But certainly... We saw during that

04:43.717 --> 04:49.527
era of a few short years a change of government 
about four times. So I don't think anybody was too

04:49.968 --> 04:55.919
happy with the governments at hand, and they 
collapsed one after the other. How well did the

04:57.682 --> 05:03.392
military attack adapt to the jungle environment 
of Vietnam? Well, I think that we had – Good

05:09.383 --> 05:10.645
training going on. I think we had a good program to 
introduce people into the country. We just didn't

05:14.972 --> 05:17.296
bring soldiers in and stick them out in the jungle. 
Most people had training programs on the ground

05:18.117 --> 05:21.863
once they got there. You made sure a guy really did 
know how to handle his weapons. It was

05:24.547 --> 05:26.590
acclimatized. And prior to deployment in those 
days, remember, that was an era of deployment

05:31.372 --> 05:35.076
because we were building up. So most people going 
over were going as units and not as individual

05:35.176 --> 05:42.303
replacements, which came later in the early 70s. 
So in those days, the units that were going over

05:42.363 --> 05:48.849
were getting considerable training before they 
were shipped to Vietnam. And as good a surrogate

05:48.869 --> 05:59.640
environment as could be built on several military 
installations with constructed villages and

05:48.869 --> 05:59.640
things like that. Were we prepared for guerrilla 
warfare? Oh, I don't think that the lack of

06:03.750 --> 06:08.076
preparation for guerrilla warfare was ever an 
issue. The answer to that is yes. We held our own. We

06:11.160 --> 06:17.148
went to school on the British successes in 
Malaysia. We had taken good look at everything

06:17.208 --> 06:20.052
going on in Indonesia. We were students of what the 
French had done right and wrong. So as far as at the

06:24.839 --> 06:28.564
small unit level, Climbing ties into the various 
crane situations was not a problem, nor what you

06:28.747 --> 06:39.122
call guerrilla warfare, which is really small 
unit warfare. So the snipers and the booby traps

06:40.324 --> 06:45.972
and so on did not... We were just as good as they were 
at that. It's all very mean stuff, but you learn to

06:45.992 --> 06:52.262
cope with that. In fact, I don't think that... any 
organization was quite effective as our Green

06:56.438 --> 07:02.166
Beret organizations in that area were quite good. 
How were the Green Berets special? Well, that was

07:05.470 --> 07:06.912
their forte. That was their training. Their 
training was to operate in small units under

07:08.354 --> 07:11.879
adverse conditions and independently. But it was 
an organization that was designed not only to

07:12.880 --> 07:26.378
fight, but to have political influence, to have 
influence on organization of villages, to to do a

07:26.611 --> 07:30.235
wide gamut of things not just related to combat. 
They're a development agency, if you will, which

07:30.536 --> 07:34.100
had a combat role. And how much of a percentage were 
the Green Braids in relation to the total forces? I

07:39.026 --> 07:42.230
really would hesitate to speculate on that. I'm 
sure there are statistics available. But in terms

07:44.813 --> 07:48.838
of The number of divisions and independent 
regiments there, the Green Berets were probably

07:49.055 --> 07:56.542
120 up to that point. And how would the other 1920s 
be rated? Well, all of our divisions were good. The

08:03.608 --> 08:13.297
1st Cavalry Division, 1st Marine Division, 4th 
Infantry Division, 101st Airborne Division, all

08:03.608 --> 08:13.297
those were, the 9th Division, all those did quite 
well. Of course, what they were doing is they were

08:13.857 --> 08:17.020
having to invent the tactics that worked along the 
way because we did exceedingly well in combat

08:17.557 --> 08:31.852
against main force units and against Viet Cong 
which were organized into battalions. But you

08:33.674 --> 08:43.043
have to realize that this was a very protracted war 
and frequently you weren't in combat simply

08:33.674 --> 08:43.043
because you couldn't find those you wanted to 
combat. I imagine. How closely did we work with

08:44.465 --> 08:46.787
Arvin? Very closely. We have probably one of the

08:49.194 --> 09:04.654
most elaborate military advisory and military 
mission systems ever fielded with respect to

08:49.194 --> 09:04.654
working with the Vietnamese Army. Every unit in 
the Vietnamese Army and Air Force to company level

09:11.472 --> 09:18.763
and often to platoon level, had US advisors who 
were there to help them train and to work. Very

09:20.165 --> 09:26.034
frequently, their approach to their tactics and 
their operations was totally different than

09:20.165 --> 09:26.034
ours. What would be some of the differences? Well, 
you have to understand that while we wanted to get

09:27.516 --> 09:36.450
in there and win the battle, they might not wish to 
do that unless they were politically expedient to

09:37.375 --> 09:42.401
do so. So you have a lot of vested self-interest in 
that military structure they had and a lot of,

09:43.362 --> 09:57.559
well, political ploy, if you will, because that's 
just New Orleans. And particularly the

09:57.579 --> 10:01.004
Vietnamese are completely totally different. 
How do you encircle ploy? Well, first off,

10:08.425 --> 10:20.396
Frequently a commander of some unit would want to 
know what the rewards to him would be to conduct an

10:08.425 --> 10:20.396
attack as opposed to being devoted to the mission. 
But the Western, and particularly U.S. approach

10:21.497 --> 10:28.103
to combat is somewhat different than the Oriental 
approach. I imagine. It's a strange way to fight a

10:30.185 --> 10:31.406
war. Well, it's not strange to be at the meeting 
zone. Were they quality fighters?

10:40.150 --> 10:47.419
Some of the Vietnamese army forces were 
outstanding soldiers. 22nd Army Division in

10:48.360 --> 10:54.949
particular, which I probably had more contact 
with than anybody, were very good. But you also had

10:54.969 --> 10:58.673
a lot of regional and territorial forces, which 
were less trained. And you also have to understand

11:00.596 --> 11:09.347
that in Vietnam, you've got a Vietnamese culture 
that traces itself back to 500 B.C. But you also

11:10.357 --> 11:19.810
have about 15% of the population which are 
minorities, tribesmen, not really the

11:10.357 --> 11:19.810
Vietnamese central culture that you think of. 
They were less well-trained and less

11:20.731 --> 11:28.461
well-organized, less well-equipped, and 
considerably less motivated. I see. And yet they

11:28.622 --> 11:30.765
were considered part of Arvin all the same. Well, 
you know, while we, as well as the Arvin, would

11:30.805 --> 11:35.571
think of Arvin taking charge of and controlling 
areas of terrain, real estate, if you will, they

11:36.040 --> 11:43.190
were less inclined to be worried about that. If 
things weren't favorable, they just moved off

11:44.312 --> 11:46.535
somewhere. That brings up something that I've 
read a lot, that in a lot of cases, we weren't so much

11:47.577 --> 12:01.837
concerned with terrain as just with the body 
counts and with, you know, killing VC rather

11:47.577 --> 12:01.837
than... Well, I don't know that that was the case at 
the unit level.

12:04.922 --> 12:05.963
Quite honestly, in especially in later years body 
count got to be a sort of a measure of success which i

12:06.938 --> 12:29.436
really question because that's that's not a very 
good measure i don't think most soldiers accept

12:06.938 --> 12:29.436
that as a good measure

12:06.938 --> 12:29.436
simply because it's a long-term result that 
counts not how many people you killed on a

12:06.938 --> 12:29.436
particular day and The body count thing really got 
to be a measure of success, if you will, when

12:29.770 --> 12:39.268
someone was trying to estimate the effectiveness 
of opposing forces after a battle. In other words,

12:39.288 --> 12:42.594
were they a viable, effective force anymore? And 
of course, that's not really key in making a

12:42.614 --> 12:49.546
difference how many people are killed in battle. 
What really counts is the ultimate outcome. and

12:53.311 --> 12:56.956
the stability that does or does not result 
thereafter. I see. So why did we use body count?

13:02.685 --> 13:06.891
Well, my personal perspective, that's what the 
civilians were demanding. Results in one form or

13:08.654 --> 13:10.597
another? Sure, results. And it's just very 
unfortunate that we ran some things the way we did.

13:17.807 --> 13:20.972
I have personally felt that... the business of six 
month command tours for commanders was a disaster

13:21.290 --> 13:39.050
because you keep changing commanders every six 
months and you just don't have the opportunity to

13:21.290 --> 13:39.050
really settle into your area of responsibility 
with a group of professionals. And too often, I'm

13:39.070 --> 13:50.824
afraid, commanders try to make their mark in that 
six months rather than waging a prolonged and

13:39.070 --> 13:50.824
protracted approach to what their 
responsibilities were. was also very much not in

13:51.226 --> 13:55.190
favor of the one-year tour. What would be a good 
line? I think that we should have put soldiers in

13:58.815 --> 14:01.397
there and left until we won. We've done that in 
other wars, and why this one was run that way, I

14:02.599 --> 14:12.930
don't know, except for obvious pressures and lack 
of support within civilian populations in the

14:02.599 --> 14:12.930
United States for the war in the first place. So I 
think that was more of an expedient to make that a

14:12.950 --> 14:17.616
one-year tour, get in and get out. And, of course, 
the result of that is when you've got a new soldier

14:17.936 --> 14:20.659
in, It was probably in his eighth month that he 
really became effective and really

14:22.360 --> 14:31.176
acclimatized. And you could depend on him to be a 
really good warrior. And then with the 12-month

14:36.326 --> 14:42.698
tour, by the time he hit his 10th month, he didn't 
want to take chances anymore. So I guess your peak

14:43.083 --> 14:51.833
of efficiency was there 8th through the 10th 
month, and you kind of had to work with that

14:43.083 --> 14:51.833
attitude. Why was the officer only six months, the 
officer's tour only six months long? Why was it

14:57.180 --> 14:59.122
shorter? Well, for a variety of reasons. With a 
one-year tour, I think what they like to do is put

15:00.464 --> 15:06.871
people in command and then bring them up with their 
experience to work at the staff levels. Also, it

15:08.413 --> 15:12.718
gave more people an opportunity to serve in 
command positions. Now, one of the things that is

15:13.272 --> 15:25.358
kind of a curiosity but very true, one thing that a 
one-year tour and a six-month command did, it put a

15:13.272 --> 15:25.358
lot of Americans through Vietnam.

15:28.797 --> 15:36.627
That is one thing we have as an advantage over the 
Russians, because our military today,

15:28.797 --> 15:36.627
especially those who serve in Vietnam, have 
combat experience. A lot of them got it in various

15:37.368 --> 15:39.370
jobs. And the Russians don't have that. They're 
getting it right now in Afghanistan. But

15:45.017 --> 15:53.387
unfortunately, most of those officers are not the 
Russians we'll be looking at in Europe. Was the

15:54.228 --> 15:57.893
mass amount of bombing necessary and effective? 
Some of the so-called saturation bombing is very

15:59.172 --> 16:02.756
effective. Some of it wasn't. And I think that, you 
know, I'm a field artilleryman, so I can speak to

16:04.177 --> 16:11.886
the delivery of indirect fires, too. When I first 
arrived in 67, there was quite a bit of shelling

16:12.767 --> 16:23.859
going on based on sightings of VC activity that 
maybe even trained myself. We got that. stopped

16:26.105 --> 16:49.885
early on because it's number one not cost 
effective and number two useless so our

16:26.105 --> 16:49.885
intelligence began to improve because we began to 
get commanders in the field artillery who

16:26.105 --> 16:49.885
realized it was futile to shoot shells out there 
unless you had a real target the so-called

16:26.105 --> 16:49.885
harassment and interdiction fires is uh 
ineffective you know that's that's just sort of a

16:53.577 --> 16:58.043
deal where you shoot it out there, and if 
somebody's there to find or not, you just wasted

16:53.577 --> 16:58.043
it. Well, out of that, it lulls the operation into 
thinking that they're being affected when

16:58.204 --> 17:04.633
they're not. And what you really have to do is put 
the heat on the intelligence community. And in

17:08.098 --> 17:12.083
Vietnam, that was one of our major problems, was 
the collection of intelligence. Why? Well,

17:14.366 --> 17:21.897
because you're dealing with a totally alien 
environment and a society whose attitudes and

17:22.535 --> 17:31.606
values are completely different from you, and who 
realize the protracted nature of any type of war.

17:31.726 --> 17:37.033
So you really had to work to get your intelligence 
and then make sure it was accurate. Did we have much

17:37.053 --> 17:41.038
of an intelligence complex set up before? Oh yeah, 
we had tremendous intelligence effort both in

17:41.058 --> 17:46.585
surveillance human intelligence, and crypto 
intelligence, the whole thing, and very

17:47.392 --> 17:52.739
effective, too. But sometimes the timing of when 
you got your intelligence was such that it was no

17:52.759 --> 18:02.952
longer of value to you immediately on a 
battlefield because it was so old by the time you

17:52.759 --> 18:02.952
got it. Oh, and it wasn't his impression. Most of 
the real successes came because battles

18:04.794 --> 18:16.048
developed, starting from what might wind up as a 
skirmish between two patrols which developed

18:16.602 --> 18:21.575
into a confrontation between two divisions 
before it was over with. So by accident rather than

18:21.595 --> 18:24.402
planned invasion? Not necessarily by accident, 
but they had a very good system of protecting their

18:24.422 --> 18:33.244
locations also. How would you rate the American 
military leadership in Vietnam? Well, it varied.

18:40.716 --> 18:42.700
Pretty obviously, that's well documented. We had 
some outstanding leadership and we had some that

18:42.720 --> 18:46.206
probably wasn't so good. I think one of the unique 
studies and leadership and the failure thereof as

18:49.441 --> 19:00.011
contained in the Peers Committee report, which I 
mentioned you might want to read, which led up to

18:49.441 --> 19:00.011
the knee line thing. And really that was a very 
tragic incident that need not have ever occurred

19:00.031 --> 19:15.084
if people understood what their mission was and if 
the entire chain of command had been down there

19:00.031 --> 19:15.084
making sure the orders had been properly 
interpreted and carried out. So why do you think

19:15.104 --> 19:16.866
they did occur? Largely, you have a situation 
where you had a unit which had taken a lot of

19:18.770 --> 19:25.577
casualties. You had leadership which,

19:26.158 --> 19:37.310
at the company level, which probably wasn't the 
best. And you had an interpretation of orders and

19:39.673 --> 19:48.743
instructions which was singularly devised by 
people at company level. And I think you had at

19:51.039 --> 20:01.629
battalion and above level a kind of an urging of the 
units involved that you better do a good job this

19:51.039 --> 20:01.629
time. You haven't in the past. Their heads are 
going to roll if this operation doesn't go

20:03.130 --> 20:06.173
smoothly. And then I think that there was some 
confusion in the orders that were issued from

20:07.074 --> 20:15.222
division level on down. How did they get Garvin? 
Well, I think they were not clear. and that they

20:18.440 --> 20:30.392
were interpreted at every level, and that people 
who issued the orders in the first place were not in

20:18.440 --> 20:30.392
a position to make sure the plan was going the way 
they had directed. And one of the criticisms I've

20:30.973 --> 20:44.747
had, and it's a real quandary problem, is that we 
had too many commanders who spent their time

20:30.973 --> 20:44.747
flying around in helicopters over the 
battlefield, and they could not get down on the

20:30.973 --> 20:44.747
battlefield and influence the action when they 
needed to. Why is that? Why were they in the

20:45.268 --> 20:46.188
helicopter? Communication, primarily. You can 
see more, you can communicate further, but you

20:48.697 --> 20:57.927
lack that sense of being there when you're on the 
end of a radio and flying over the battlefield. So

20:57.967 --> 21:13.084
it just leaves interpretations of what the 
mission was to the people who are on the ground and

20:57.967 --> 21:13.084
you're not there to stop things or change things 
when they need to be. Was there much inter-service

21:14.110 --> 21:17.734
rivalry in Vietnam between the various? No, I 
wouldn't say there was inter-service rivalry, at

21:18.956 --> 21:24.282
least at my operating level. There may have been up 
above. I'm sure everybody wants to grab the glory,

21:28.166 --> 21:31.130
you know. But as far as an actual combat situation, 
there's a great deal of cooperation.

21:40.661 --> 21:42.683
What does the word fragging mean? Oh, well, that 
referred to a phenomenon that began to take place

21:43.000 --> 21:49.369
in the late 70s.

21:53.215 --> 21:55.859
I'd left, so I never heard of a frag against that 
point. I'd left in 1968. In the early 70s, I think

21:58.302 --> 22:11.742
continuing weakness in leadership and 
continuing lack of support for the mission, kind

21:58.302 --> 22:11.742
of a... improper indoctrination of the soldiers 
that were sitting there. Above all, dragging the

22:17.585 --> 22:32.043
bottom of the barrel at some of the draftees and 
inductees we were getting at the time and the drug

22:17.585 --> 22:32.043
problems that were being imported caused the 
so-called fragging. Fragging just means that

22:32.123 --> 22:41.475
somebody has thrown a grenade in their platoon 
leader or platoon sergeant's temp, which is a form

22:32.123 --> 22:41.475
of mutiny, if you will.

22:44.442 --> 22:47.245
Those incidents were highly overplayed. That 
occurred, but not to the great degree that I think

22:47.285 --> 22:54.173
the public was awful at believing. And when it did 
occur, you probably found a breakdown of

22:55.874 --> 23:04.164
leadership or a group of people that should have 
been gotten out of there early. Was there much drug

23:04.184 --> 23:05.245
use? Yeah, toward the end, quite a bit. Sure. Why? 
Why? Look at the population of the United States.

23:13.433 --> 23:15.177
The whole population was on drugs. Why not the 
soldiers that were being sent over there? They

23:18.805 --> 23:23.876
probably had more anxiety and cause to experiment 
with marijuana and other things and people back

23:18.805 --> 23:23.876
up. And how much effect do you think that had on our 
ability to fight effectively? Well, I think it

23:27.986 --> 23:30.852
screwed up the whole nation's morale. I don't 
think that got turned around until within the last

23:31.557 --> 23:37.243
five years, as a matter of fact. In Vietnam, did it 
affect the soldier? How much did it affect the

23:39.706 --> 23:42.949
armed forces, their ability to fight? I think it 
had a tremendous impact because obviously

23:43.129 --> 23:57.704
somebody's got his head screwed up, can't be 
relied on, nor trusted in any form, shape, or

23:43.129 --> 23:57.704
fashion.

23:58.205 --> 24:01.108
How did you perceive that the media handled the 
coverage of the war? Oh, that was very

24:01.392 --> 24:04.797
independent. Independent on who you're talking 
to. The biggest problem I had with, quote, media

24:08.964 --> 24:13.311
was not the media themselves. And there were a lot 
of outstanding correspondents that I knew that

24:13.331 --> 24:19.420
did a tremendous job. But they began to be so 
pressed for deadlines that if the the news by a

24:25.388 --> 24:32.695
certain time, and frequently they would turn in 
anything that looked like a story even before it

24:25.388 --> 24:32.695
transpired.

24:34.277 --> 24:40.523
You know, when you start a battle, particularly 
around 5 o'clock in the afternoon, it doesn't even

24:34.277 --> 24:40.523
really get good until about 8 p.m. But those guys 
are all left at 5.15 to make their deadlines, so

24:40.684 --> 24:48.732
they never were around for the real stuff too 
often. But the guy that went to the field and stayed

24:48.752 --> 24:51.875
with you did a good job. And we're talking 
correspondence there as opposed to...

24:55.274 --> 25:01.742
television and radio folks who I thought did 
somewhat less of a professional job. How so? Well,

25:04.065 --> 25:06.588
they just were news makers rather than reporters. 
If there wasn't anything going on, they'd admit

25:06.908 --> 25:10.152
something. And did that affect the Dwar effort at 
home adversely? I don't think there's any

25:16.620 --> 25:24.589
question, but what slanted reporting, 
particularly in the television media,

25:25.480 --> 25:28.664
undoubtedly had an impact on the national morale. 
On the other hand, I would not lay a blanket

25:30.907 --> 25:45.768
criticism on the press either, or the television, 
because I think that many of the things they

25:30.907 --> 25:45.768
reported on that sounded adverse were probably 
accurate. How did you view draft evaders and

25:45.788 --> 25:49.513
anti-war activists? Well, you know, nobody likes 
a draft evader and a guy who runs off to Canada or

25:50.945 --> 25:56.974
Sweden. But you have to realize that's occurred in 
every war we've been in. There were far fewer draft

26:02.642 --> 26:11.536
evaders and deserters and so forth in the Vietnam 
War than there were in the U.S. Civil War. By a wide

26:11.556 --> 26:12.177
margin. But look at the statistics. Nobody ever 
thinks of that. In fact, there were very few,

26:16.628 --> 26:21.894
compared to places, even compared to the Korean 
War. If you go dig out the facts. Even in the late 70s

26:23.636 --> 26:28.361
with the state movement and everything else 
getting... Yeah, I'd say so. So did it have much of

26:28.381 --> 26:32.305
an effect on troop morale? I don't think it had much 
of an effect on troop morale. I mean, the troops

26:34.207 --> 26:36.629
didn't like them. But then, many troops didn't 
like guys who hid out in colleges getting degree

26:36.710 --> 26:43.497
after degree and their PhDs simply to avoid 
military service. And some of them are now

26:43.897 --> 26:46.500
faculty. I imagine. So what was the mood in Vietnam 
when you left in 68, is that right? Yeah. What was

26:53.582 --> 26:54.423
the mood then? Well, first off, when you say when I 
left, that's a good one, because I left in April,

26:55.104 --> 27:05.960
and recall that we'd had a major 10 offensive in 68 
in February. Now, clearly at our level, at the

27:06.781 --> 27:14.952
soldier level, we knew damn well we would have 
kicked the dickens out of them, there was no

27:06.781 --> 27:14.952
question. It was an absolute decimation of a 
couple of main divisions and the V.C. Front Army.

27:20.938 --> 27:30.231
Now, having said that, it was also obvious at 
higher levels that they had demonstrated their

27:20.938 --> 27:30.231
ability to launch such an attack. And I think that 
most people had accepted assurances, accurately

27:30.251 --> 27:42.829
or inaccurately, which probably were delivered 
for political purposes that no such thing could

27:30.251 --> 27:42.829
occur. So I think it was a general shake-up of the, 
shall we say, the confidence at governmental

27:43.180 --> 27:51.810
levels. I think this led to some, while we won the 
battle on the ground, we probably lost the battle

27:51.830 --> 28:01.260
on the political level, particularly at the 
negotiating tables. What was your role

28:01.720 --> 28:04.704
specifically in Tet? What was your, or were you? 
Well, as I say, I was personnel officer of the 1st

28:06.546 --> 28:10.250
Steel Artillery in the train. We got hit directly 
there.

28:15.631 --> 28:28.466
Basically, my role was to sit out the night and keep 
things secure in my area until we got things looked

28:15.631 --> 28:28.466
up in the morning. It was largely a matter of 
ensuring that the security plans for the city were

28:28.486 --> 28:35.635
operating, and they were. When you say personnel 
officer, what What did that entail? Oh, the

28:40.974 --> 28:58.913
personnel officer is responsible for all 
assignments, replacements, casualties,

28:40.974 --> 28:58.913
decorations and awards, moving people from one 
place to another, keeping the strength up, making

28:40.974 --> 28:58.913
sure that the medical facility's working, making 
sure the chaplain's working, you name it. It's

28:58.933 --> 29:05.140
everything to do with the life of the soldier, if 
you will. I see. Why did we lose the war? I don't

29:07.538 --> 29:08.879
think we lost the war. I think that's a matter of 
conjecture there. I think that

29:13.224 --> 29:25.697
I think the real thing here is not a matter of 
losing, it's a matter of deciding if we had

29:13.224 --> 29:25.697
invested enough into it and withdrawing. I 
wouldn't call it lost because that pretends that

29:25.717 --> 29:32.805
you got beat on the battlefield right out of 
country and that certainly isn't what occurred.

29:32.925 --> 29:34.086
We started withdrawing and cutting our support 
because I think our national leaders decided that

29:34.825 --> 29:46.590
that was a sump of national manpower and national 
fortunate that we didn't want to support any more,

29:46.992 --> 29:51.637
which is unfortunate. What would it have taken to 
have won? I don't know. But if we had a commitment to

29:55.662 --> 30:00.047
do so, we should have stuck with it. And is it in 
politics? Well, certainly. That's the basis for

30:03.270 --> 30:06.995
having a war anyway, is the political aspect. 
There are six elements of national power, and the

30:07.015 --> 30:16.105
political one is the one that's supposed to be 
preeminent in a situation like this. element

30:17.705 --> 30:21.049
fails and the statesmanship fails, then you go to 
war. What are you going to do? You've got to give a

30:22.751 --> 30:25.914
mission and make sure it's clearly understood. 
That's one of the biggest troubles the military

30:26.535 --> 30:31.680
had, was understanding what their mission was. 
You know, you're going to conduct an attack in

30:31.701 --> 30:38.969
order to stabilize the government of South 
Vietnam. Hell, that's not a mission. If your

30:40.840 --> 30:48.449
mission is to destroy, seize, hold, occupy, 
that's a mission. But these nebulous things with

30:48.469 --> 30:56.058
respect to designing military missions in 
political terms just don't happen. What else

30:56.078 --> 31:01.765
could we have done outside of the military arena in 
order to make it a national mission? Well, in the

31:02.106 --> 31:07.472
first place, I think one of the major lessons 
learned is that you do not get into an involvement

31:07.925 --> 31:16.121
like that on that scale unless you're willing to 
commit the nation to do it.

31:16.902 --> 31:18.906
We just learned the same lesson the French did. The 
French people got tired of being involved and

31:19.547 --> 31:27.402
that's why the French wound up in a situation of 
being given food.

31:29.339 --> 31:32.584
So would it have taken more civilian advisors? 
Should we have started at the village level? We

31:35.829 --> 31:39.334
already had people in the division at the village 
level. You have to realize that Vietnamese

31:39.414 --> 31:47.967
culture was not understood very well by most 
people. And until you understand that culture, it

31:48.147 --> 31:56.640
can be very frustrating when all your efforts seem 
to go for nothing. It's an entirely different

31:56.660 --> 31:58.182
culture than that.

32:03.578 --> 32:10.025
So what lessons should we have learned from being 
here? Well, I think there are a great number. It

32:12.008 --> 32:17.154
depends on where you want to start and what area.

32:17.834 --> 32:19.897
Any military lessons? Well, yeah, I think there 
are a lot of military lessons learned. First off,

32:21.999 --> 32:32.151
one of the biggest things we learned is that we can 
project force into a rather hostile environment,

32:21.999 --> 32:32.151
into places which are not well-developed. And the 
first time I went to Vietnam, I came over the beach,

32:32.384 --> 32:36.850
so that would give you an idea. The next time I 
landed, no. So I think that we've learned that we

32:39.474 --> 32:52.051
can indeed carry out warfare at all scales in any 
kind of environment, and we have the ability to do

32:39.474 --> 32:52.051
that. I think we learned some lessons about tour 
links, command links, I think we learned some

32:59.857 --> 33:04.362
lessons about structure and organization for 
that type of war, too. How? Well, I think that most

33:04.842 --> 33:14.192
of the people who were in high-level positions in 
command had not had that experience, OK? And

33:14.752 --> 33:21.980
having said that, they had had experience in more 
conventional warfare in, say, Korea in our World

33:14.752 --> 33:21.980
War II. Those conventional formations 
frequently were not well suited to the job at hand.

33:27.869 --> 33:32.963
And tailoring the forces to the situation and to 
the mission was very crucial. Because we

33:33.765 --> 33:40.022
initially had forces that were tailored to 
attack, seize, and hold terrain. Well, having

33:40.711 --> 33:42.756
done that, so what? You haven't accomplished much 
because the Vietnamese were perfectly prepared

33:42.836 --> 33:50.915
to sit there and see if you're going to sit there 10 
years on it. Were the VC good fighters? Some were.

33:53.682 --> 33:54.684
Some were excellent fighters. Some of them were 
veterans of the wars against the French. I imagine

33:58.514 --> 34:02.198
some of them had been fighting 20 years. Well, the 
majority of the VC there were inexperienced. The

34:07.023 --> 34:07.863
NVA were good fighters. They were professionals.

34:16.032 --> 34:25.281
One of the bigger political lessons learned, I 
think, was we got confused, in my view, at the

34:16.032 --> 34:25.281
political level early. Because even as early as 
65, 66, 67, I used to hear people talking about was

34:25.598 --> 34:37.793
there this business of if we drive north, will it 
draw the Chinese into the war? Well, I always

34:37.813 --> 34:45.382
consider that to be an absolutely ludicrous 
statement because the Chinese would never have

34:37.813 --> 34:45.382
supported the Vietnamese other than in a cursory 
fashion. The Russians were supporting the

34:45.542 --> 34:48.326
Vietnamese, not the Chinese. And a lot of people 
felt that the Vietnamese were the puppets of the

34:51.383 --> 34:52.565
Chinese. No way. The Vietnamese and Chinese hate 
each other.

34:59.555 --> 35:09.030
Certainly there were a great number of Chinese 
weapons being used by the Vietnamese, but I think

34:59.555 --> 35:09.030
that that was misinterpreted as China supplying 
these. What it really was is the Russians buying

35:09.050 --> 35:11.974
them and sent them in through China. Just a 
convenient way of doing business. Was there much

35:18.885 --> 35:24.955
subversion

35:18.885 --> 35:24.955
from the south side? In South Vietnam, was there 
much subversion going on? Sure. You mean with

35:28.600 --> 35:32.507
respect to the local governments and so forth? 
Yes, sir. Oh, absolutely. Of course, that was a

35:34.370 --> 35:36.493
D.C. mission. Assassination and so forth. Sure. 
That, plus just general indoctrination. So one of

35:44.021 --> 35:50.729
the things that, well, I could spend about an hour 
talking about what you've got to do with these

35:44.021 --> 35:50.729
people. I think that's kind of important to 
understand. Can you briefly describe how they

35:53.592 --> 35:58.317
would be different for us, or how ? I just wrote 
myself some notes here this afternoon while we

35:58.357 --> 36:03.443
were thinking about it. When you talk about VC, you 
really have to think of them in terms of people.

36:11.930 --> 36:14.513
The Vietnamese are different. First off, they've 
got a group orientation, rather than an

36:14.833 --> 36:19.518
individual orientation. And that's totally 
alien to the Western society. Your orientation is

36:23.642 --> 36:26.024
individual. Theirs is as a group. And they have 
very strong feelings of community, of Vietnam as a

36:31.773 --> 36:37.300
whole, as I say. They trace their culture back to 
about 500 B.C. And they are no stranger to war.

36:44.148 --> 36:46.831
They've been at it since about 500 B.C. And they've 
been occupied by several cultures. The Chinese

36:51.837 --> 36:56.864
twice, the Japanese once, the French, the British 
in recent years. So they have a... a kind of, I won't

37:01.608 --> 37:14.044
call it nationalistic, more a philosophical idea 
about the commonality of themselves as a people or

37:01.608 --> 37:14.044
as a group rather than as any individual. And they 
have a strong sense of their right to statehood as a

37:15.366 --> 37:23.256
free and independent state reunited north and 
south and all of that. And you really have to take a

37:24.137 --> 37:28.763
hard look at the division and how that took place 
when were there to understand that as a rather

37:29.131 --> 37:33.095
large mistake. But it had to be done as an expedient 
to keep the North from just overrunning the South

37:34.556 --> 37:42.704
at that time. Vietnamese have what I call terminal 
loyalty to this thought of their independence as a

37:45.167 --> 37:56.438
people separate from any other people in the 
world.

37:57.329 --> 38:02.756
And they really have what I would call low esteem 
for individualism, except for their heroes. And

38:03.597 --> 38:09.705
their heroes are the ones who did things which, you 
know, they died for the group. Such as? Yeah, a lot

38:11.147 --> 38:13.410
of them. So these are the people. They are very 
strongly nationalistic. I noted here that, first

38:18.035 --> 38:21.640
off, they've got a sense of shared values. The 
Vietnamese people feel that their values are

38:22.781 --> 38:29.891
shared all with each other, north or south, and 
with no one else in the world. Some of their values

38:30.692 --> 38:33.455
are different. Secondly, they've got a common and 
unique language. It's a romanticized, oriental

38:37.381 --> 38:39.544
language. They speak French fluently 
throughout, and English. As I say, they're a

38:46.925 --> 38:53.340
unique ethnic group because they can find their 
beginnings way back when. And they've got about

38:53.761 --> 38:58.251
15% minorities, which are definitely oppressed. 
Who would be a minority? Mainly the tribesmen. The

39:02.923 --> 39:03.544
tribesmen? Yeah. I forget on the, was it 
Montagnards? Montagnards, yeah. There are some

39:09.612 --> 39:16.141
Cambodian strains, there are some Laotian 
strains, which are more closely related in

39:09.612 --> 39:16.141
commonality to Laotians. Cambodians don't care 
for it. A lot of Chinese live in the big cities. And

39:23.011 --> 39:23.952
they're oppressed? The Chinese weren't because 
they were rich. They went to all the restaurants in

39:26.230 --> 39:30.097
Saigon, for example, and things like that. They 
are no longer in charge, I'll guarantee you.

39:32.340 --> 39:32.901
They're gone. They are out of Vietnam. But the 
Nords were oppressed? Yeah. Assessments in

39:42.258 --> 39:53.160
working against fighting the VC and the North 
Vietnamese were of course enlisted, because they

39:42.258 --> 39:53.160
didn't particularly care about, you know, 
whether they fought them or not. And for that

39:53.180 --> 40:00.975
reason they were more of a mercenary group than one 
united like the Vietnamese. One curious thing is

40:01.951 --> 40:04.915
the religious mix in Vietnam. You've got Taoism, 
you've got Buddhism, you've got Confucianism,

40:04.935 --> 40:18.573
you've got Christianity, which is predominantly 
Catholic, and then you've got a couple of weird

40:04.935 --> 40:18.573
offshoots called Khao Dai and Wawa, which are 
really cults more than religions. But because of

40:19.414 --> 40:26.303
that, there is no strong thread of religion and 
nationalism. I don't understand. Well, what I'm

40:27.605 --> 40:31.250
saying is there's no religion which tends to be the 
national religion. Okay. What I'm telling you is

40:31.735 --> 40:38.024
religion is subordinated in the Vietnam society 
to nationalism. Well, how did such a split occur?

40:41.749 --> 40:47.598
If it's such a nationalistic country, how did... 
Well, it was political, predominantly. You have a

40:47.698 --> 40:56.010
situation where North Vietnam, predominantly 
our Ho Chi Minh, was about to swallow the whole

40:47.698 --> 40:56.010
country under its Marxist-Leninist philosophy. 
I see. In the South, they felt that they wanted to go

40:56.591 --> 41:01.017
it alone independently. and sought to help the 
Western nations to

41:01.267 --> 41:07.313
do something. But

41:07.333 --> 41:12.779
the infrastructure for the Viet Cong began then. 
The VC wasn't something that was invented in the

41:13.780 --> 41:16.543
60s. They've been there since the 40s. So I'm 
afraid a lot of people just don't comprehend what

41:20.386 --> 41:26.152
it takes to overcome that. And you can't sell them 
Western ideals. So in my view, the essence of the

41:31.169 --> 41:53.692
whole thing is that if you wanted to have a Vietnam 
that was Western-oriented, and to me there were

41:31.169 --> 41:53.692
some good reasons for that, then we had to make the 
political, societal, and financial commitment

41:31.169 --> 41:53.692
to see that was done, which would be a long, long 
call. What would it take to do that? I don't know. Do

41:56.596 --> 41:57.216
you get it? I don't know. We didn't have the staying 
power.

42:06.790 --> 42:10.115
Or, if you will, the national will to stay. The

42:10.255 --> 42:22.372
Vietnamese, particularly when the North came 
down in the 40s, they essentially decimated all

42:10.255 --> 42:22.372
the school teachers. They executed them. So the 
academic

42:24.455 --> 42:29.222
structure was young, and

42:30.012 --> 42:39.627
they consider their intellectuals to be part of 
the elite. But even the elite have this attitude of

42:39.647 --> 42:49.562
loyalty to the nation state over and above an 
individual or a philosophy. So that's still . But

42:53.748 --> 42:55.611
you see, the VCs were everywhere. And they could 
live in a village undetected Because when you came

43:00.674 --> 43:07.312
to look for them, the people had to think and look at 
you and wonder, okay, you're here today, where

43:00.674 --> 43:07.312
will you be tomorrow? And if we turn that VC over and 
you leave, who comes in to find out why we did that?

43:15.473 --> 43:17.198
So there was a strong threat of retaliation at the 
village level. And would that have contributed to

43:20.931 --> 43:29.941
the paranoia about, you know, getting bodies and 
just killing people, like with the VC and

43:20.931 --> 43:29.941
infiltrating like that? I'm not so sure about 
that. I think that that was largely, again, an

43:31.563 --> 43:39.373
effort to say, hey, we're, you know, we must be 
winning because we have the bodies that are piled

43:31.563 --> 43:39.373
up. And that's not a good measure. You're winning 
when you see... You know, many other things. And

43:50.838 --> 43:52.980
the VC had a very strong indoctrination problem. 
See, they'd come into a village, and they'd round

43:53.000 --> 44:03.971
everybody up at night, and they'd bring them in and 
preach their nationalistic Marxist-Leninist

43:53.000 --> 44:03.971
stuff at them for hours and hours on end. And who was 
to stop it? One of the major problems you had in

44:08.475 --> 44:15.062
Vietnam, as you do in Central America, is absentee 
land ownership. So you've got landowners who live

44:15.683 --> 44:23.331
back in the big cities who extract heavy taxes from 
the farmers and they never see them. And you've got

44:23.391 --> 44:27.695
the DC coming down here saying the land will be 
yours, our great victory. They tell them it will be

44:29.677 --> 44:32.100
theirs as part of the group. But still, having 
ownership as part of a group would be preferable to

44:33.821 --> 44:45.353
some of those farmers than the situation they had 
where they were occupying land that they could

44:33.821 --> 44:45.353
never own. And the best they could do to hope for is 
make another crop. So with the VC of the county, how

44:49.343 --> 45:03.865
quickly would the North have overrun the South if 
they had just not had the elections in 58 and then we

44:49.343 --> 45:03.865
hadn't intervened? Would it have been a matter of 
years? I don't know. I wasn't there. So you can read

45:08.532 --> 45:11.296
any book you want to. Most people think it would 
have been a matter of months, I think. Fall and the

45:14.645 --> 45:21.870
two Vietnams pretty well documented the strength 
and structure now.
