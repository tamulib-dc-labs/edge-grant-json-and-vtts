WEBVTT

00:04.081 --> 00:09.147
Class number 12, first priority, and down to 14, we could only enter three priorities.

00:09.167 --> 00:16.035
But also, I signed up asking to go immediately from A&M without any delay.

00:17.437 --> 00:21.361
So, final review Saturday, and I reported to Fort Sam Houston Sunday.

00:22.362 --> 00:27.468
And stayed there for a month until I went up to Fort Sill to attend school.

00:27.849 --> 00:28.470
And that's 1941.

00:28.650 --> 00:29.891
That's in 1941.

00:30.051 --> 00:33.936
And that was by choice, because my employer,

00:34.372 --> 00:40.358
future employer, prospective employer, had said, well, go on and get it over with right now.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.563
But others kind of stayed around.

00:45.123 --> 00:46.705
Others were not quite old enough.

00:46.725 --> 00:52.071
Pete Wainer, incidentally, was not old enough to accept his commission of age 21.

00:52.151 --> 00:56.416
So he did not come in until probably 1942.

00:57.096 --> 00:58.458
I don't, early 1942.

00:58.618 --> 01:03.383
I don't know exactly when his birthday was, when he turned 21.

01:03.616 --> 01:10.384
How did you and your friends feel at final review that day?

01:11.846 --> 01:13.848
That was a rough one.

01:15.530 --> 01:22.919
There is a picture inside our annual that was taken at that time, and people were gathering.

01:23.440 --> 01:31.429
I don't know, this is just a little excerpt from it, but that was taken right after final review.

01:32.270 --> 01:55.982
As you can see, there's not really very many happy faces there, solemn, not sad or anything, except sad that we're not going to see our good friends for a bit, but just recognizing really that we had a responsibility to do, and we were now out of college, and we had to move on, move on with our life.

01:56.603 --> 02:05.226
How well prepared did you and your buddies feel you were for this military service?

02:05.246 --> 02:06.449
I felt very prepared.

02:07.030 --> 02:08.735
And let me just say one other thing, too.

02:09.196 --> 02:10.680
In the field artillery,

02:10.762 --> 02:21.635
You have techniques for adjusting observed fire, as we would call it, where you would look out and see what the round was, where it was landing and where you wanted the target to be.

02:22.576 --> 02:29.283
I learned as much over here on campus out behind Law Hall about observed fire as I ever learned in the Army.

02:30.605 --> 02:39.435
I don't, they would change a few of the techniques, but the basic ingredients of it, I learned that here where we would have a,

02:41.103 --> 02:48.091
There would be a little BB-type gun and shoot little projected steel balls out there.

02:48.892 --> 02:53.878
And we would see where it hit and the dust that would fly, a little bit of dust.

02:54.359 --> 02:59.104
And that's the way that I really learned observe fire techniques for the field artillery.

02:59.665 --> 03:04.631
And as I say, I learned very little more at Fort Sill.

03:05.792 --> 03:08.916
And also I think that...

03:10.212 --> 03:13.303
through the ROTC and various

03:13.655 --> 03:23.567
and particularly as a battery commander here, that I learned a good deal about leadership in dealing with people from various backgrounds.

03:23.707 --> 03:28.773
Because in the Army, you never knew what the background was with your people.

03:29.694 --> 03:41.248
But anyway, I think that I don't know anybody that really was scared, you know, of accepting the responsibility of an officer.

03:41.228 --> 03:50.458
Who came of your family and other loved ones, who came to commissioning and final review and graduation?

03:58.847 --> 04:01.110
My oldest brother and my youngest brother.

04:02.632 --> 04:04.894
My mother was living in Alabama.

04:04.914 --> 04:09.379
She had remarried and they came up for it.

04:10.118 --> 04:17.306
The youngest brother is one that I remember a little bit more about because I had bought his old car.

04:18.447 --> 04:24.013
And they were up here and we said our goodbyes.

04:27.777 --> 04:35.485
But my oldest, when my father died, my oldest brother was my father figure.

04:37.287 --> 04:41.994
He was the one that I got the closest to and so it was a, he was here for it.

04:42.635 --> 04:43.996
What about commencement?

04:44.377 --> 04:45.138
Where was it held?

04:45.218 --> 04:46.059
Who was the speaker?

04:46.800 --> 04:47.882
I don't know who the speaker was.

04:48.082 --> 04:50.786
It was held in Guyon Hall, where else?

04:52.128 --> 04:54.992
No other place really that it could be held.

04:54.972 --> 04:57.135
Was every name called, every hand shaken?

04:57.316 --> 04:57.696
Oh, yes.

04:58.237 --> 04:58.478
Yes.

04:59.720 --> 05:05.329
I told you, I was going across twice, name called twice, handshake twice, empty tube twice.

05:08.934 --> 05:09.415
Let's see.

05:09.936 --> 05:19.832
Any stories you can share about getting dates and having dates on an all-male campus?

05:22.293 --> 05:25.917
Well, housing, talk about that for just a minute.

05:28.740 --> 05:47.980
When the girls would come down mostly from TSCW then called, having changed from CIA earlier, the powers that be here would select the dorm that they were to be housed in and everybody would have to move out.

05:48.533 --> 05:56.382
and clean up and make arrangements to bunk in with somebody else.

05:56.683 --> 05:59.867
So that was the housing arrangement for them.

06:00.407 --> 06:06.895
Some of them would come in on a bus and some of them would come in on a train.

06:08.757 --> 06:15.165
And through various

06:17.272 --> 06:23.138
friends who would find out if they were having a date come down and if she had a friend.

06:23.218 --> 06:31.105
And that was the way I got to date with a Catholic girl, Jenny McGurk.

06:31.886 --> 06:36.170
But we were never serious at all.

06:36.190 --> 06:43.397
And as I kind of remember it, the first time,

06:45.706 --> 06:49.151
I got the impression that she wanted a date so that she could come down here.

06:49.872 --> 06:51.694
The second time, I invited her.

06:52.496 --> 07:02.349
And I don't remember the how, whether we were all standing around a phone or what, or writing a letter or what.

07:02.389 --> 07:04.152
But anyway, it worked.

07:04.232 --> 07:12.844
And then you would take them around on Sunday morning

07:13.263 --> 07:23.481
They'd go to church or visit various areas on campus and you knew what time the train was taken off or the bus was taken off and you'd make sure you got them there.

07:23.501 --> 07:30.273
How, in general, how were those young ladies treated by Aggies?

07:30.293 --> 07:38.427
I think they were treated with golden gloves, with respect and with care.

07:41.292 --> 07:52.552
Some guys would seem like always try to pull some plank and leave some plank in their room, short sheeting.

07:53.473 --> 07:58.322
They'd make up the beds and short sheet them, but most of the time it was just, you know,

07:58.943 --> 08:02.709
They're coming, they're our guests, and we treat them like that.

08:03.410 --> 08:13.625
Was it okay at a big campus dance for an Aggie to play a trick on another Aggie at the dance?

08:13.645 --> 08:15.247
Not particularly.

08:15.267 --> 08:20.956
So that you as a fish, a sophomore would not take advantage of you at a dance?

08:21.837 --> 08:21.897
No.

08:22.957 --> 08:28.908
No, but most of the time, sophomores were not at freshman dances.

08:28.928 --> 08:29.989
Oh, boy.

08:30.010 --> 08:30.510
And vice versa.

08:30.911 --> 08:38.985
Yeah, but when you, let's see.

08:39.005 --> 08:46.078
There was some organization, I can't quite remember, but it seemed like that,

08:47.341 --> 08:49.584
would have multi-classes.

08:50.124 --> 08:53.248
Yeah, maybe that was it.

08:53.268 --> 08:58.835
But anyway, I've never heard of that really back in those days.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.922
Let's see, student indulgences.

09:05.863 --> 09:13.652
When students were going to have a big time on Saturday night, what were they smoking and what were they drinking and where?

09:16.265 --> 09:19.730
Smoking would only be cigarettes, period.

09:22.094 --> 09:29.225
Drinking would be beer or something else, and probably out at Uncle Ed's.

09:29.245 --> 09:31.428
Was it respectable to go to Uncle Ed's?

09:31.949 --> 09:32.169
Oh, yes.

09:32.189 --> 09:32.409
Okay.

09:32.930 --> 09:39.901
And some would, on some of those weekends, would take their dates down there.

09:40.141 --> 09:44.027
But no, it was just a hangout.

09:46.201 --> 09:49.586
For those days, it was easy walking.

09:49.926 --> 09:52.831
It wouldn't be now for most of them.

09:52.851 --> 09:55.775
They'd have to drive down there, but it was easy walking.

09:59.941 --> 10:11.938
But there was another place that was started out on University West, out beyond where the vet medicine is now.

10:13.876 --> 10:28.554
I can't remember, but there was another sort of a nightclub type outfit out there, and that was nicer and well-respected.

10:28.574 --> 10:34.821
I can't remember what it was called.

10:35.324 --> 10:37.447
You said cigarettes.

10:37.547 --> 10:39.009
Did anybody smoke pipe?

10:40.391 --> 10:42.554
Not much.

10:42.734 --> 10:43.595
Cigars, no.

10:44.997 --> 10:46.099
Mostly cigarettes.

10:46.119 --> 10:51.026
Oh, there was some that chewed tobacco, yeah.

10:51.226 --> 10:58.816
And if they drink any hard liquor, harder than beer, did they go to Whiskey Bridge to get it?

11:01.760 --> 11:03.643
And mostly it would be...

11:05.176 --> 11:16.621
Rum or just, I wouldn't call it bourbon, but I guess it's just whiskey.

11:17.984 --> 11:18.705
Rum or whiskey.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.590
Mixing it with Cokes, probably.

11:20.730 --> 11:20.950
Oh, yeah.

11:21.993 --> 11:23.556
What else but Coke?

11:24.093 --> 11:25.134
Run and Coca-Cola.

11:25.595 --> 11:28.579
All right, we're getting close to the questions I've thought of.

11:28.619 --> 11:28.980
Let's see.

11:29.901 --> 11:33.726
Did you know anything about secret fraternities when you were an undergraduate?

11:33.927 --> 11:35.288
No, anything about it, no.

11:35.328 --> 11:43.440
But I heard, but could not swear to it, but that TTs, true Texans.

11:44.661 --> 11:50.269
But I did not, and I got, I was not.

11:50.249 --> 11:56.188
I don't know that I knew anybody that was one, if there were one, if there were some.

11:56.790 --> 12:00.622
As far as you knew, what was the purpose of that organization?

12:01.444 --> 12:03.330
I did not know the purpose whatsoever.

12:03.766 --> 12:08.371
Just a secret society, kind of just a group of their own and whatever.

12:08.491 --> 12:17.520
Now, remember, I've got that swastika.

12:17.540 --> 12:22.365
And I think that was the other one that existed at some point way back early.

12:24.468 --> 12:29.773
What have we left out so far that you had thought of that we ought to talk about?

12:38.174 --> 12:50.017
I guess really sort of a special bond with people that you got to know here for however you got to know them.

12:51.681 --> 12:52.943
What creates that bond?

12:59.082 --> 13:13.897
certain likes, you know, of the person, but certain similarities and experiences or certain just experiences here at A&M.

13:14.438 --> 13:17.561
For instance, I mentioned Lel and Beard a couple of times.

13:19.963 --> 13:21.885
We were in the same outfit for five years.

13:24.167 --> 13:25.849
We only roomed together one year.

13:27.888 --> 13:32.315
But we have maintained a very, very close relationship.

13:33.537 --> 13:36.302
He lived down in Rosenberg.

13:36.362 --> 13:47.820
He lived in Rosenberg when he was in school here, but he went to work for Pan American Airways as a flight engineer and flew worldwide.

13:47.800 --> 13:56.291
When I was in the station in Germany, and see, I came home in 52, so I don't know, it might have been 50 or 51.

13:57.172 --> 14:01.518
He had been off on a flight to the other side of Germany somewhere.

14:02.019 --> 14:02.860
I got it.

14:02.880 --> 14:06.264
Oh, okay.

14:06.284 --> 14:14.976
And Carl, some way or another, got in touch with me in Germany and said, I'm going to be in Munich, such and such a date and time.

14:14.996 --> 14:17.419
So we met down there.

14:18.715 --> 14:26.583
And then when we were coming home from Germany in 1952, he was living on Long Island.

14:26.603 --> 14:34.872
And, you know, coming home and bringing a car home and everything else, you don't get everything coordinated exactly.

14:34.932 --> 14:38.516
So we spent a couple of days with Leldon and Marge there.

14:38.677 --> 14:40.539
And we're good friends here.

14:42.881 --> 14:44.723
I've mentioned Pete Weiner.

14:46.053 --> 14:54.624
We had many relationships together, family-wise.

14:56.126 --> 15:13.427
He and Joe Alice got married February the 14th of 1942, and I was stationed at Fort Sill, and so was he, and I was courting Arlene, and when she would come down to visit, she would stay at their house.

15:14.183 --> 15:17.549
And this just continued all the way.

15:17.670 --> 15:20.194
And then I mentioned also Bill Becker.

15:22.278 --> 15:26.186
It has just grown a little bit closer since we've been out of the Army.

15:26.987 --> 15:30.293
We were never really much together.

15:30.313 --> 15:37.086
We were in Pentagon when he was up there on training to go to attache work.

15:37.673 --> 15:49.206
Just some bond here and also I mentioned the names that are over on the memorial plaque at the MSC.

15:49.326 --> 15:55.894
I try to go over there Memorial Day, July the 4th, and November the 11th.

15:56.835 --> 16:05.605
I don't always make it because of some other being away or whatever but try to go over there and read all those names and

16:05.770 --> 16:08.833
And I mentioned Jack Cooper back a ways ago.

16:08.873 --> 16:12.557
His name is there, and one of his roommates was David E.D.

16:12.597 --> 16:16.121
Long, and their names are right together under the class of 1939.

16:16.161 --> 16:27.673
It just, I don't know, it's just a special bond of background and common interests, whatever.

16:27.793 --> 16:32.858
Are there some events that Aggie students

16:33.361 --> 16:39.230
that is while they're students, are there some events that are most important in creating this bond?

16:44.237 --> 16:47.021
Events as such, I don't view that.

16:48.003 --> 16:56.095
It's just being together, it's living together, it's working together, studying together.

16:56.362 --> 17:03.802
being in the same outfit or, well, Leland is the only one of those that I've been in the same outfit with.

17:04.343 --> 17:11.282
But in the same classes, you study together, you happen to,

17:12.157 --> 17:17.547
be on some committee for one of these organizations.

17:18.890 --> 17:27.646
For instance, the people that worked on the Longhorn, I think that those people are about, still about as close as you could get somebody together.

17:28.929 --> 17:31.533
I don't think it is an event.

17:31.854 --> 17:34.519
I think it just happens over time.

17:37.182 --> 17:37.805
Let's see.

17:37.865 --> 17:44.779
Nearing the end, if you have any A&M memorabilia,

17:46.143 --> 18:00.048
letters, diaries, journals, photos that you are ever planned to dispose of, I beg you, please put them in the A&M archives so they would be preserved forever.

18:01.270 --> 18:10.446
And or if you have letters, particularly while you were a student and or during the war that you would be willing

18:10.426 --> 18:16.874
to have copied, you keep the originals and copies there, make the archives aware.

18:17.955 --> 18:22.701
We want to preserve as much as we can of the reality of Texas A&M as possible.

18:25.565 --> 18:33.395
The only thing that I know that I have as such is the commencement exercise pamphlet.

18:35.898 --> 18:36.779
The program?

18:38.241 --> 18:39.943
Okay.

18:40.885 --> 18:45.009
During World War II, you know, we had V-mail.

18:47.171 --> 18:52.616
I have at least all that my brother kept, and I think he kept them all.

18:53.277 --> 18:54.398
I have all of those there.

18:54.438 --> 18:56.540
Not that many because I wasn't overseas that long.

18:56.980 --> 18:59.022
All right, now you see, those would be priceless.

18:59.703 --> 19:10.453
And if you ever, like I would suggest you consider having copies made and passing a copy to each of your children and grandchildren and put a copy over there.

19:10.433 --> 19:19.669
I mentioned V-mail the other day to somebody, and they thought, this was to a bright undergraduate, they thought I was mispronouncing e-mail.

19:20.270 --> 19:22.094
I told them it was a bit different.

19:22.835 --> 19:23.616
Victory mail.

19:23.676 --> 19:24.438
You're right.

19:24.458 --> 19:25.199
All right, let's see.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.463
Another question.

19:27.443 --> 19:42.247
Let's make believe that somebody comes up to you and gives you a check for a million dollars with only one restriction to it, that you are to pass that on to Texas A&M, but you get to tell the A&M administration what they are to do with it.

19:42.767 --> 19:46.954
If you had a million dollars you could give to A&M, what use would you want them to make of it?

19:58.645 --> 20:02.969
I would say half to presidential scholarships and half to core scholarships.

20:04.531 --> 20:08.675
And on what basis would you want those two groups of scholarships awarded?

20:20.427 --> 20:27.994
The core scholarship, I would want

20:29.273 --> 20:33.000
to be for those with an advanced contract.

20:35.544 --> 20:48.227
I understand my background and this might be a bias because of that, 24 years in the Army, but I just think that

20:49.777 --> 21:07.096
military service is one very vital way that we can help this nation, even in spite of some of the problems with retention these days.

21:07.276 --> 21:18.248
But still, military service is good and it develops leadership and even though you might not

21:18.937 --> 21:23.462
remain in the military for, you know, until retirement or anything like that.

21:24.082 --> 21:27.065
Still the leadership part of it is present.

21:28.487 --> 21:40.759
For the other scholarship, presidential scholarship, I don't know that there's any setup now for it.

21:41.900 --> 21:48.707
But I think that those student leaders in the various

21:50.510 --> 22:05.645
programs and activities under MSC are, that is a wonderful training ground for them and I would want that part of it recognized and supported.

22:07.887 --> 22:08.528
Last question.

22:09.249 --> 22:13.013
What feelings do you hold in your heart for Texas A&M today?

22:18.158 --> 22:20.500
Oh boy, a feeling in my heart.

22:26.487 --> 22:28.629
It's right there with God, country and family.

22:34.174 --> 22:35.856
Texas A&M is part of the country.

22:39.620 --> 22:50.310
Texas A&M is, you know, I don't know where I would be if I hadn't come down here to school.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.515
I'd probably be a dead cotton farmer.

22:57.014 --> 23:08.274
But it's just, you know, God, country, family, A&M, it's just hard really to, well, not really.

23:08.314 --> 23:14.004
God has to come first, but family.

23:14.184 --> 23:19.393
But Texas A&M, country, they're essentially synonymous with me.
