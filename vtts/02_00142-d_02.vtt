00:02.258 --> 00:07.329
I was trying to figure out what I could do to show my appreciation to all the good people here who had helped me so much.

00:09.053 --> 00:16.830
And some of you people can use fancy words, make speeches, and I decided the best way for me to show my appreciation was to use my right arm.

00:18.053 --> 00:22.242
I then stopped and said, Randy, that's more eloquent than any of us could ever be.

00:23.099 --> 00:25.624
I don't remember that, but that sure sounds good.

00:25.644 --> 00:27.448
I'll take credit for it.

00:27.468 --> 00:32.017
Do you remember, was that an easy night's sleep the night before?

00:33.340 --> 00:34.201
Yes, it was.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.466
I usually didn't have trouble sleeping the night before.

00:36.486 --> 00:38.931
It's the night after coming down.

00:39.552 --> 00:47.045
That was, you know, I'd been throwing well, and I was ready, and I did well at home, and I was looking forward to it.

00:47.065 --> 00:48.007
It was not something I dreaded.

00:48.027 --> 00:49.870
Did you do anything that Saturday night to celebrate?

00:49.930 --> 00:51.493
I can't remember at all.

00:51.633 --> 00:56.983
And you're married by then, so your wife is there, but was any other family here?

00:59.467 --> 01:00.349
You know, I don't think so.

01:00.669 --> 01:01.611
I think it was just...

01:01.844 --> 01:03.266
Just my wife here.

01:03.286 --> 01:06.872
All right, back to the campus and academics.

01:07.452 --> 01:13.762
Did your grades ever show any difference in the semesters when you were competing?

01:14.543 --> 01:16.566
Fall semester grades any different than spring?

01:17.928 --> 01:22.796
No, I think they were kind of balanced out.

01:22.976 --> 01:31.108
You know, you had to travel a little more in the spring, but also that gave me an opportunity, especially late in the spring when I was traveling by myself,

01:31.932 --> 01:40.600
You know, it's harder to travel on the team bus when you're going to Laredo or somewhere like that, or Houston.

01:41.321 --> 01:51.450
But when I'm traveling by myself to California on an airplane and back and spending hours in Lowell Love Field, then you can, I probably spent more time studying when I was competing.

01:51.490 --> 01:56.135
Now, I didn't, when I got out there, I didn't spend a lot of time on it while I was sitting around in the room getting ready for the meet.

01:56.275 --> 01:59.458
But traveling, I was able to, so I didn't really,

01:59.945 --> 02:07.259
I would, if I had an option, and they didn't give him any options in those days, I would try to take a little lighter load in the spring if I could.

02:07.860 --> 02:10.525
The real difficult time I had was the year I played basketball.

02:11.426 --> 02:19.742
And you go all, most of the fall, and then, I mean, you finish basketball up, and they're wondering if I'm going to be at the track meet that weekend.

02:20.380 --> 02:25.105
And that was, basketball was a lot harder on me at track, because they had basketball games on Tuesday nights.

02:25.986 --> 02:27.728
Why did you decide to go out for basketball?

02:27.748 --> 02:44.004
Well, I was kind of stale in track, and Shelby Metcalf came to me, and I liked him a lot, and he said, and I was a basketball player in high school, and I really wondered if I could play, and I was kind of stale from just competing all year round.

02:44.024 --> 02:46.827
I was kind of stuck in that fall in the weights, and I wasn't,

02:47.465 --> 03:01.459
I was kind of in a rut, and for some reason he came to me and said, you know, I'm not putting pressure on you, but I think we've got a chance to win the championship, but we really need some rebounding help inside.

03:01.959 --> 03:13.050
We got Beasley who can score, but we need some, and this is a chance for us to win the championship, and if, you know, and he said, I'll do anything I can to make it as,

03:13.351 --> 03:14.232
easy for you.

03:14.872 --> 03:16.834
You know, you can lift weights a couple times a week.

03:16.915 --> 03:18.236
I'll give you time off for that.

03:18.896 --> 03:20.458
You know, we'll do whatever we can.

03:20.518 --> 03:25.243
And he said, I'll tell you this, you know, I'll do whatever I can.

03:25.283 --> 03:29.967
So I came to him back and said, you know, I think I'll try it.

03:29.987 --> 03:31.008
I think it surprised him.

03:32.350 --> 03:34.071
And he said, well, I'll do what I said.

03:34.111 --> 03:36.834
He said, I'll tell you something else I'll do.

03:36.854 --> 03:41.839
If this doesn't work out for any reason, we're going to say that

03:42.629 --> 03:45.612
that you really need to get back to training.

03:45.632 --> 03:49.676
The Olympics are coming up and it's hurting your track.

03:49.756 --> 03:53.220
I appreciate that because it was kind of a gamble.

03:54.361 --> 03:58.365
When I played in high school I weighed 215, I weighed 267 now.

03:58.385 --> 04:11.438
And I remember the first day I show up, it's the first day of official practice and they're running the bleachers two times in G Raleigh, which are pretty steep bleachers.

04:11.890 --> 04:13.253
And he said, you don't have to do this.

04:13.273 --> 04:16.038
And I said, I need to start right now doing whatever everybody else does.

04:16.058 --> 04:18.503
So, you know, I don't want any different deal.

04:18.523 --> 04:21.328
And I regretted saying that because it about killed me.

04:21.348 --> 04:23.392
I finished about 30 minutes after the rest of them.

04:23.452 --> 04:26.899
I was big and strong, but I couldn't run those bleachers.

04:27.560 --> 04:30.125
And just about killed me.

04:30.205 --> 04:31.688
And I said, I may have made a big mistake.

04:32.984 --> 04:45.886
I don't remember ever going over there, even though it never came up, to lift weights because I went from 267 to 235 quick because I never run so much in my life.

04:47.008 --> 04:48.952
And he worked you out hard.

04:49.192 --> 04:50.835
Basketball practices were challenging.

04:51.957 --> 04:53.760
I got involved in it.

04:54.432 --> 05:08.829
I started out fairly well and then I wasn't doing very well and I had blisters and a problem and actually sent me home a day or two early for Christmas to kind of recuperate and I really had a feeling I might come back and this might be the time we sat down and said I was a track man.

05:09.630 --> 05:18.921
I came back, kind of rejuvenated and after that had a pretty good year and enjoyed playing.

05:19.357 --> 05:22.782
Through the first half of the season, we had a three-game lead.

05:23.342 --> 05:27.548
We had all of our tough games at home then, except for Texas, and we beat them in Austin.

05:28.890 --> 05:33.736
We beat the SMU and Arkansas and Texas Tech at home.

05:33.956 --> 05:41.666
In the last half, we had to go to those places, Arkansas, Texas Tech, and the SMU all beat us on the road in tough games.

05:42.327 --> 05:45.411
And we actually lost the conference last game of the season in Arkansas.

05:45.431 --> 05:48.115
We had won the Southwest Conference.

05:48.095 --> 05:51.741
And then Texas beat us at home that year in a fluke.

05:51.761 --> 05:54.485
They had a kid score 33 points that's averaging about six.

05:56.208 --> 05:57.429
But it was a good experience.

05:57.530 --> 06:02.758
I really enjoyed playing for Coach Metcalf and playing with those guys.

06:02.798 --> 06:06.163
But by then I tore a cartilage in my knee that season.

06:06.223 --> 06:08.386
I weighed 230 pounds.

06:09.248 --> 06:10.970
And I never did get it back that year.

06:11.010 --> 06:15.958
And I couldn't come back and play again because I had the Olympics coming up and

06:16.495 --> 06:20.541
and remember I had a silver medal and my career would not be complete without a goal.

06:21.241 --> 06:22.223
I didn't want two silvers.

06:22.503 --> 06:28.672
Now don't I remember you're getting a key rebound or blocking a key shot in the SMU game here, right at the end of the game?

06:29.473 --> 06:35.180
No, that was against Texas Tech, and it's a big game, and I stole a pass.

06:35.721 --> 06:38.585
They were trying to pass it to a guy named Ruther who later became a coach.

06:39.226 --> 06:42.250
I stepped up, got the pass, and then I won.

06:42.753 --> 06:47.980
When it all settled, I'm in the open court with the basketball, which is something I never wanted to be.

06:49.122 --> 06:54.029
One of the things you miss out by throwing shot puts and lifting weights is ball handling.

06:54.049 --> 07:01.760
And I kicked and chased the ball all the way under the basket, finally got a hold of it, and I'm down there by myself, and they're all coming.

07:02.501 --> 07:12.675
And I'm falling out of bounds, and I turned around, and a guy from Dumas, Texas, Dick Rector, is breaking, and I threw it to him, and he scored, and we won the game.

07:13.516 --> 07:17.743
It could have easily ended up me sitting out of bounds down there by myself.

07:17.763 --> 07:21.328
And I remember one story.

07:22.811 --> 07:24.333
Shelby likes to tell it.

07:25.094 --> 07:28.800
He makes up a lot of stories, but we're playing TCU.

07:29.181 --> 07:36.953
TCU had a little guard from Pampa, Texas that was on the team with me that I used to blame costing us a state championship.

07:37.094 --> 07:38.055
His name was Wayne Crease.

07:38.155 --> 07:39.137
He was kind of a hot dog.

07:39.618 --> 07:40.519
He was a good player.

07:41.073 --> 07:44.699
We're beating TCU by about 15 points in G. Raleigh.

07:45.700 --> 07:48.645
And Kreese comes down, and I've watched him play so many times.

07:48.725 --> 07:51.028
I knew that he's going to take a jump shot.

07:52.390 --> 07:53.432
And I'm under the basket.

07:53.512 --> 07:56.256
He's out almost what would be a three-point line.

07:57.178 --> 07:58.740
And I took off running toward him.

08:00.062 --> 08:06.051
And about the time he shot, and I got the ball, but I also put him in about the third row of the bleachers.

08:07.094 --> 08:09.136
And they called foul on me.

08:09.737 --> 08:14.002
Coach Metcalf called me over to the side and said, you did that intentionally.

08:14.022 --> 08:15.023
I said, no, I was trying to block you.

08:15.043 --> 08:15.964
He said, don't tell me that.

08:16.344 --> 08:20.709
You're getting even from high school, you know, and we're 15 points ahead and it looks bad.

08:20.770 --> 08:22.011
You hurt him like that.

08:22.111 --> 08:23.773
You know, if it's a close game, it doesn't matter.

08:23.813 --> 08:30.000
But as close as he came to chewing me out the whole year, he had a technique of not chewing you out.

08:30.020 --> 08:31.802
He'd just make his awful face.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.864
And it could hurt you worse than any chewing out you'd ever get.

08:34.904 --> 08:38.691
And I played hard for him because I had a lot of respect for him.

08:39.312 --> 08:42.016
And you had a confidence with him when he got down late in the game.

08:43.579 --> 08:47.205
And he called you over and he said, I want you to do this and you do this.

08:47.265 --> 08:51.051
You knew exactly what to do and you knew if you do it, it was going to work out.

08:51.091 --> 08:52.995
And you had that confidence with him late in the game.

08:53.175 --> 08:55.579
And most coaches don't give you that.

08:56.977 --> 09:06.087
During your undergraduate days, were you a member of any of the other campus organizations other than athletics?

09:06.808 --> 09:15.418
I was in the Marketing Society because Herb Thompson was the sponsor, and I thought it might help me in his class, and also the hometown club.

09:15.438 --> 09:16.700
Now, Pampa didn't have a hometown.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.281
They had hometown clubs in those days.

09:18.301 --> 09:18.802
They don't know.

09:18.942 --> 09:24.148
Pampa didn't have one, but Amarillo, we went to that a couple times, but we didn't care much for it.

09:24.871 --> 09:27.073
of Mamarella because they were big competitors.

09:27.794 --> 09:46.694
And, but, you know, it was, when you work out three hours a day, you know, I think if I had to do over again I would have been involved a little more because I think those, there was tremendous benefit to those that participated in campus or even back in those days.

09:47.015 --> 09:48.736
But today there's a lot of opportunity.

09:48.957 --> 09:52.060
Now the hometown clubs quite often arrange rides home.

09:52.580 --> 09:54.723
You had wheels from when?

09:55.344 --> 09:55.644
What year?

09:56.065 --> 09:57.367
Oh, probably our sophomore year.

09:57.447 --> 10:00.471
We had a vehicle.

10:00.531 --> 10:02.193
Either Donnie or I had one.

10:02.834 --> 10:06.540
But it was always a deal where somebody's going near there.

10:06.560 --> 10:09.724
I don't hardly ever remember us leaving just us two.

10:09.764 --> 10:11.687
There was always a... Do you remember ever hitchhiking?

10:11.707 --> 10:12.328
Did you ever hitchhike?

10:12.348 --> 10:13.710
We hitchhiked some.

10:13.730 --> 10:15.572
Did you have had any interesting experiences?

10:15.592 --> 10:16.333
Right.

10:17.815 --> 10:21.220
Ted Nelson, who's a great track man, coach at A&M now,

10:22.212 --> 10:24.974
We would fly, we flew out to California.

10:26.536 --> 10:31.260
And this is the weekend before final exams started on Monday.

10:31.280 --> 10:34.863
And we'd fly back to Dallas and we got a four hour layover.

10:36.264 --> 10:43.511
And I remember the tickets, $19 from Love Field to College Station and you could cash them in.

10:45.413 --> 10:51.578
So he said, I know a guy that will pick us up and take us to the edge of Dallas

10:51.895 --> 10:55.519
and we'll be home before that plane would, and we'll make it $19.

10:55.540 --> 10:57.162
I said, I don't know.

10:57.542 --> 10:58.864
Tell him, we got finals and everything.

10:58.944 --> 11:00.045
He said, no, I guarantee it.

11:01.267 --> 11:03.750
So that was about midday.

11:04.911 --> 11:16.165
So we got a ride out there, and we got a ride to the, it would be the north side of Waco, and we can't get across Waco, so we walk.

11:16.946 --> 11:18.007
I'm carrying my shot put.

11:18.188 --> 11:19.369
All he has is his running shoes.

11:19.409 --> 11:20.991
I got my shot put in my bag.

11:21.612 --> 11:24.735
And we walk most of the way across Waco.

11:25.556 --> 11:37.790
We get picked up by a country preacher that gets us finally to College Station about 11.30 that night.

11:39.051 --> 11:40.312
Final start in the next morning.

11:40.332 --> 11:45.578
I'm so mad Nelson, he won't get near me because he knows I'm going to kill him if I ever get my hands on him.

11:45.929 --> 11:51.720
And the irony of it is we turned those tickets in, he got his $19 and I never got my $19.

11:51.860 --> 11:55.788
And we talk about that hitchhiking trip today.

11:56.028 --> 11:58.313
There was a couple others, but that's the one that I remember the most.

11:58.333 --> 12:01.399
I wasn't big on hitchhiking.

12:03.443 --> 12:07.330
During those days, did you ever hear of secret fraternities?

12:07.478 --> 12:07.819
No.

12:08.359 --> 12:10.122
You weren't aware of any.

12:10.583 --> 12:14.909
Let's see, and this is the time you're here when women are admitted and black students are admitted.

12:16.011 --> 12:19.796
Describe what it was like as far as you're aware for the first black students on campus.

12:20.477 --> 12:27.047
Well, you know, Curtis Mills and some of those guys are the first ones, and we accepted them well.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.090
They fit in well.

12:30.272 --> 12:33.497
I don't remember any problem that way.

12:33.517 --> 12:34.859
Now, they probably might, you know.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.182
What about the women?

12:38.208 --> 12:42.252
You know, there were a few women on campus and we had a great respect for them.

12:42.272 --> 12:45.215
They were treated much better than they're treated today, I think.

12:47.517 --> 12:51.281
See, we felt like they had destroyed the university while we were here.

12:51.861 --> 12:54.944
And one of the bigger things than that, to me, was changing the name.

12:55.765 --> 13:01.290
The name change took place, you know, went from a college to a university.

13:01.310 --> 13:04.013
They changed the name.

13:04.415 --> 13:13.150
made the Corps optional, and we weren't in the Corps, but that was going to ruin the place, and they met women in, but the women deal started kind of slow.

13:13.170 --> 13:28.296
You know, they say women can come, but they didn't even have facilities for them, they didn't have dorms or anything, so that really didn't kick in until later, but we thought if we suffered through it, that everybody else would have to suffer through the same kind of, and A&M was kind of considered a

13:29.153 --> 13:34.481
like a marathon run, it's something you endure and once you finish, you have a great satisfaction of completing the race.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.965
And it's not that way.

13:36.985 --> 13:39.508
The students didn't relate to that today.

13:39.528 --> 13:41.812
They come here and they do not want to leave.

13:42.052 --> 13:44.776
It's a more wonderful experience than it was for us.

13:44.836 --> 13:46.639
Now the camaraderie that we had, I think,

13:47.260 --> 13:54.147
They have a hard time matching that, but... And in hindsight, what do you think those changes, if they had not happened?

13:55.628 --> 14:01.874
Well, I think that I've watched my daughter come to A&M.

14:01.894 --> 14:04.717
I've watched my daughter-in-law come to A&M.

14:07.059 --> 14:15.748
And, you know, I still think we've lost some things because of those changes, but it's obvious it's made it a great thing.

14:16.370 --> 14:17.511
world class university.

14:17.752 --> 14:39.019
And the old Aggies that used to give me the most trouble about those changes, because when I first came back to work here in 72, that was still kind of fresh and a lot of the people that were in strong influential positions and able to give a lot of money were still upset about that until their granddaughters wanted to come.

14:39.792 --> 14:45.885
I've enjoyed over the years a grandfather calling me that I remember saying, can you help my granddaughter get in?

14:45.926 --> 14:51.959
And I said, boy, as times change, and he said, I'll admit, you know.

14:54.204 --> 14:57.531
Let's see, your senior ring, do you remember when you...

14:58.388 --> 15:00.371
Went over to order it and how you felt?

15:00.992 --> 15:01.773
I remember getting it.

15:01.813 --> 15:06.400
I don't remember exactly ordering it, but it was something that was very important.

15:06.420 --> 15:07.282
How much did it cost?

15:07.302 --> 15:08.544
Do you remember?

15:08.564 --> 15:09.365
$37.50.

15:09.906 --> 15:12.270
Where did you get that money?

15:12.290 --> 15:14.092
Well, see, by then I was married.

15:14.934 --> 15:15.114
Oh, okay.

15:15.134 --> 15:21.744
And my wife, she made $280 a month teaching.

15:22.105 --> 15:22.185
Hmm.

15:23.296 --> 15:27.921
And I made 80-something on my scholarship and we lived off campus.

15:28.501 --> 15:33.987
And we had a, I remember we was having a bank draft for $50 into our savings account, which I hadn't been able to do since.

15:34.728 --> 15:37.791
But no, I remember being upset with her.

15:39.573 --> 15:43.978
I had, my ring disappeared after that and I wanted a diamond in it.

15:43.998 --> 15:45.980
I thought people put little diamonds in it.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.161
I thought that was a thing to do.

15:48.242 --> 15:49.363
And my ring disappeared.

15:49.523 --> 15:51.025
I called the police.

15:51.207 --> 16:05.966
I didn't have the money to go order another one then so I waited and then when the ring, at Christmas I got a big box and I opened it up and she had a diamond and I was mad at her because she didn't understand what that felt like, you know.

16:05.986 --> 16:10.853
And so it was very important to me.

16:10.873 --> 16:13.536
Why are Aggie rings so important?

16:14.579 --> 16:17.985
Well, you know, it's kind of like talking about the Aggie spirit.

16:18.025 --> 16:19.488
I think it's hard to do.

16:19.948 --> 16:22.873
They've been basically unchanged for many years.

16:24.316 --> 16:28.082
It's some way that you can really quickly look at somebody.

16:28.103 --> 16:32.029
On an airplane, when I'd start visiting with somebody, it's just a habit of checking it out.

16:32.069 --> 16:34.714
Even when I was in school driving, somebody would come up to me.

16:35.302 --> 16:36.765
You know, you look for that ring.

16:37.406 --> 16:41.033
And Aggies, almost without exception, wear the ring.

16:41.574 --> 16:49.189
Have you had any places where you were somewhere on the other side of the world or run into some interesting person who spotted an Aggie ring?

16:49.450 --> 16:51.674
Oh, often, yeah.

16:51.694 --> 16:55.842
In Europe, traveling and, you know, places out of the way.

16:55.822 --> 17:13.928
And, you know, when they say, well, I'm so-and-so class of 52 or 46 or something, it does create an immediate camaraderie or bond with them or you feel different about them immediately when you find that out.

17:14.369 --> 17:16.472
I guess it's still the same for the young ones today.

17:16.773 --> 17:21.880
I used to feel that way when I'd see a bumper sticker, though, you know, like going into Houston.

17:22.349 --> 17:25.173
And now, going down there, there's so many of them.

17:25.193 --> 17:28.617
They don't even bother to, say, gig them or wave at you.

17:29.398 --> 17:34.946
But it used to be a deal where you'd almost pull over to the side of the road to visit with somebody if they had an Aggie sticker.

17:35.606 --> 17:36.628
You've never lost your ring?

17:37.349 --> 17:37.509
No.

17:38.730 --> 17:40.573
I thought I have a couple times.

17:41.654 --> 17:42.856
I've gotten some good stories.

17:43.156 --> 17:48.503
I came back from speaking at a meeting.

17:48.523 --> 17:51.327
I remember stopping at a Dairy Queen to eat.

17:51.830 --> 18:03.595
and I remember throwing the trash in the dump on the way out and I got back and I realized they didn't have my ring and I,

18:04.840 --> 18:07.984
I called back and offered a reward to the Dairy Queen.

18:08.064 --> 18:10.307
I would drive back over there.

18:10.347 --> 18:12.610
They had a kid to pay the kid to go through the dumpster.

18:13.070 --> 18:16.534
I got home, was sick, and I never had to put it on.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.577
And that didn't happen very often.

18:18.597 --> 18:19.798
I hadn't told that story very much.

18:19.838 --> 18:25.245
I'm kind of ashamed that I could go all day without knowing I had it on, but I did.

18:26.238 --> 18:28.902
All right, now let's go back to this special young lady.

18:29.603 --> 18:31.906
She was from Pampa.

18:31.926 --> 18:32.467
From Pampa.

18:33.068 --> 18:34.991
And you all did not date in high school.

18:35.011 --> 18:35.492
No.

18:35.512 --> 18:37.194
But then she goes to Baylor.

18:37.615 --> 18:38.556
No, she went to Abilene Christian.

18:38.576 --> 18:39.398
I mean, Abilene Christian.

18:40.039 --> 18:41.581
And then you all get serious.

18:41.801 --> 18:45.146
When does it, what year does it get serious?

18:45.186 --> 18:46.628
Well, that would have been in 1966.

18:47.109 --> 18:50.434
Your sophomore year, junior year?

18:50.454 --> 18:52.357
It would be my junior year.

18:52.397 --> 18:53.038
Junior year.

18:53.474 --> 18:59.262
And, you know, I had to lay out a semester, and then the Olympics were coming up again, so I extended.

18:59.562 --> 19:03.368
I took my last six hours, I held over to go.

19:03.468 --> 19:12.360
I actually went five years because I laid out a semester in 64, and then I either had a choice, go to the Army,

19:12.897 --> 19:16.903
and go to the Olympics so I think I stayed in school another semester to be sure I get to go to the Olympics.

19:17.764 --> 19:28.078
And so she graduated in 66 and was going to Dallas to teach school or something.

19:28.118 --> 19:37.251
She got her in education and that's when we decided well maybe we'll just go ahead and get married and come on down here and that's what we did.

19:37.231 --> 19:40.535
All right, y'all got married, and she, does she start teaching that?

19:40.575 --> 19:41.075
Start teaching.

19:41.095 --> 19:42.357
First at A&M Solidarity?

19:43.117 --> 19:46.061
No, at elementary school, Crockett.

19:46.661 --> 19:47.142
In Bryan?

19:47.763 --> 19:48.884
Crockett Elementary in Bryan.

19:48.904 --> 19:49.104
All right.

19:49.725 --> 19:50.646
And y'all lived where?

19:51.487 --> 19:59.696
We lived on Dexter Street next to Dr. Barton Nelson, in a little house that is Dr. McDermott's library now.

19:59.876 --> 20:02.979
He's converted, but it was a lot more like a boxcar than it was a house.

20:02.999 --> 20:03.440
What was the rent?

20:03.460 --> 20:03.900
Do you remember?

20:04.121 --> 20:06.343
80, I think it was $85.

20:06.323 --> 20:13.612
And so her teaching salary and you got a little bit of an allowance for living off campus.

20:13.632 --> 20:17.637
What you got is equivalent to your scholarship if you lived on campus, which I think was about $80.

20:18.037 --> 20:20.460
And you all managed to start saving?

20:20.480 --> 20:21.261
Start saving money.

20:22.102 --> 20:24.605
Now you've been frugal all your life.

20:24.625 --> 20:26.728
When did you start making investments?

20:26.708 --> 20:31.755
I started in 1969 when I left A&M.

20:32.657 --> 20:35.060
I guess every paycheck after that.

20:35.181 --> 20:38.526
I went to work as a stockbroker and that's got an interest in the market.

20:38.546 --> 20:39.868
But I had a good teacher.

20:39.908 --> 20:44.615
My dad did that a little bit even though he made very modest money in the oil fields in his own company stock.

20:45.416 --> 20:49.662
And my older brother started in high school investing in the stock market.

20:50.165 --> 21:00.089
And he worked in oil fields most of his life and has more money than a lot of executives have because he's invested in the market for all those years.

21:00.149 --> 21:07.347
But I was conditioned to do it and never thought I was very smart at picking them, so I just better do it steady and every month.

21:07.732 --> 21:15.985
Every time I got a raise, I would take another $10 or $15 or $25 a month and put it into the stock market.

21:16.265 --> 21:16.546
All right.

21:16.646 --> 21:20.893
Then you all got, became active in the NM Church of Christ.

21:20.973 --> 21:21.293
Yes, sir.

21:21.954 --> 21:30.087
And you all went to, did you all go morning and evening, Sunday morning, Sunday night?

21:30.868 --> 21:34.414
We, most of the time, you know, all the,

21:34.765 --> 21:40.697
through all the years of raising our children and being here, we'd go Sunday morning, Sunday night, and Wednesday night.

21:40.717 --> 21:51.919
It got harder when I, Wednesday got harder for me because of my work later on and kids' activities, but we've tried to do that.

21:52.841 --> 21:54.985
And that church has been an important part of

21:55.319 --> 22:01.585
Yes, one of the things that, not only friends, but that keeps us here.

22:01.665 --> 22:06.310
It's been part of our lives for a long time.

22:07.731 --> 22:17.280
It seems to me there's a kind of a consistency in faith and A&M ways of doing things.

22:18.882 --> 22:21.985
Since you were not in the Corps, you didn't have senior boots.

22:21.965 --> 22:27.093
but a senior ring, and what about commencement when you graduated?

22:27.153 --> 22:30.779
Describe that, and who came, and what was it like?

22:30.979 --> 22:33.183
Well, and I don't remember a lot about it.

22:33.203 --> 22:34.465
I remember I wasn't going to miss it.

22:35.326 --> 22:48.107
It was that important to me, and Mr. Zachary was the speaker, and it was short, but it was about taking risk, and, you know, we had a lot of Aggies

22:48.323 --> 22:53.350
And I got to know them a little bit in my working years and boy, I was very blessed because of that.

22:53.410 --> 23:00.259
The Polly Krueger's and the Pat Zachary's and Sterling Evans and some of those Aggies.

23:00.279 --> 23:04.765
You go back for the history of the whole school and they're as important as anybody's ever been to this school.

23:06.267 --> 23:09.532
And I'm fortunate I got to be around them a little bit.

23:09.552 --> 23:12.816
And Mr. Rudder was the one who shook your hand.

23:13.377 --> 23:14.719
Right.

23:15.290 --> 23:16.834
What do you think about that man, Rudder?

23:17.014 --> 23:21.164
Oh, I think he was one of the A&M heroes.

23:22.747 --> 23:28.320
You know, for all he was able to accomplish

23:29.296 --> 23:32.341
You know, it gave us a feeling of pride in our school when he was here.

23:32.361 --> 23:50.950
You know, he was tough, and we took pride in that, and we knew he wouldn't put up with any monkey business with us, but he would, you know, would protect A&M, and I was very fortunate to get to know him, and one of the greatest thrills I ever had was

23:50.930 --> 23:58.397
Well, you know, I told you he would call me, you know, and say, you know, I appreciate what you did for A&M, you know, when you had a good meet and little things like that.

23:58.557 --> 24:16.915
But when I'm a, I'm in training to be a stockbroker down in Houston, and my boss is an Aggie, and I get a call, and I can't officially, I can't really take an order because I'm not registered, but he wants to buy, he's going on the board of a company, and he thinks he needs to buy some stock in it.

24:16.975 --> 24:19.097
It was a substantial amount of stock.

24:19.972 --> 24:22.437
And this is a national company.

24:23.880 --> 24:28.929
And I got to go over to my boss and said, you know, I got this guy calling me.

24:28.989 --> 24:30.011
And he said, well, who is it?

24:30.051 --> 24:32.516
And I said, well, it's Earl Rudder.

24:32.536 --> 24:33.458
Well, you know, I mean,

24:33.995 --> 24:36.939
That turned out to be the biggest order I ever had.

24:37.339 --> 24:42.886
And then later he sold it when he went off the board in less than a couple of years or something changed.

24:42.906 --> 24:47.491
But I could call him after he bought that stock if anything ever happened in it.

24:47.511 --> 24:50.155
I could call and they'd say, well, he's not in.

24:50.195 --> 24:51.596
And I said, well, this is Randy Mason.

24:51.616 --> 24:53.699
You're supposed to hold on.

24:53.739 --> 24:55.421
And he's in Dallas and here's the number.

24:55.441 --> 24:56.302
And I could call up there.

24:56.342 --> 24:57.744
He was interested in that stock.

24:58.144 --> 25:00.407
And I had an entree in the business.

25:00.961 --> 25:30.360
General Rudder that not many people had because because they had his money invested down there and but you know he was You know, I just had a chance to be involved in A&M and what I think after the 200 year history is done is gonna be golden years some golden years, you know, and we didn't realize all that he was doing then we just knew what he you know the kind of man he was and

25:30.745 --> 25:35.571
And I think he was a great role model for, you know, a lot of Aggies in there.

25:35.732 --> 25:36.513
He even followed later.

25:37.694 --> 25:39.076
What creates Aggie spirit?

25:41.039 --> 25:44.563
Well, you know, that's a tough one to answer.

25:44.583 --> 25:47.227
I don't think, I think everybody's got a little different answer to that.

25:48.609 --> 25:57.360
I think Buck Wires was asked that a lot of times.

25:58.657 --> 26:14.421
They asked him that when he was out at Texas Tech doing a consulting deal and it's about as good an answer as I heard and it was, well it's something that happens to you while you're there and I can't explain it to you because you wouldn't ever understand, you know.

26:14.441 --> 26:16.003
And it's something that happens on the campus.

26:16.063 --> 26:23.955
Now I've always wondered in my role as alumni director here for 20 years and working here for 27 or 8 years.

26:24.762 --> 26:32.429
Do we attract a kind of person that is that way already, or is it something that happens to them here?

26:33.210 --> 26:35.052
I think it's a little combination of that.

26:35.332 --> 26:37.094
I think it's a combination of both of those.

26:37.254 --> 26:45.362
I think that there's some people that could come here that wouldn't buy into that, but I think generally they don't come here.

26:45.882 --> 26:47.604
They think that's not important to them.

26:48.265 --> 26:53.790
I think those who come here want to be a part of that, and because of that they buy into it, but it's still something that happens to them

26:54.310 --> 26:57.854
And it's in all areas of the university.

26:57.874 --> 27:07.146
Some people get it in student organizations, some people get it in the core, some people get it in MSC programs, some people actually get it in academic, you know.

27:07.166 --> 27:19.522
They come here for something special and I think that it's a little different to everyone but it's something that you get and that's why it's hard to explain to others and it's hard for them to understand it.

27:19.602 --> 27:20.723
They cannot understand

27:21.158 --> 27:24.282
why Aggies will do for their school what they will and how they feel about it.

27:24.762 --> 27:32.712
We're very critical anymore of the school Aggies are, but they defend it right up to the end.

27:33.152 --> 27:37.797
What did you learn at A&M that has been important to you in your life since then?

27:38.578 --> 27:48.550
Well, A&M, for me, I was always kind of shy, and I think that you're expected to step up, introduce yourself,

27:49.154 --> 27:58.767
you're expected to participate in the classroom and you know in athletics.

27:58.827 --> 28:13.086
I think it helped me being an Aggie that we were kind of quote persecuted by others and you had to you know stand up for the school and it was a big help to me that way.

28:13.859 --> 28:17.685
And the camaraderie, I think, is something that I've enjoyed.

28:18.527 --> 28:25.939
When you run into somebody, you know, I'm in Houston last week and run into a veterinarian that didn't even start here until Class 79.

28:27.061 --> 28:32.631
But we understand certain things differently than we would if we, you know, both weren't Aggies.

28:33.633 --> 28:39.242
If you were a consultant to the Texas A&M leadership of today, what kind of advice would you give them?

28:41.500 --> 28:53.778
Well, you know, I would tell them that change is inevitable, but they need to really look at the things of the past and see that there's some things that we need to try to keep at A&M.

28:54.139 --> 28:55.801
And I know that's hard to do.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.926
It's hard to do at the association.

28:58.966 --> 29:07.238
I look at, I didn't feel like we changed all that much in the 20 years I was there, but I look at the beginning and the end and it changed a great deal.

29:08.112 --> 29:10.036
But we never changed just to change.

29:10.337 --> 29:13.384
And we didn't necessarily have to be just like other people.

29:13.404 --> 29:16.992
And I think A&M is not for everyone.

29:17.533 --> 29:20.039
I think for some students maybe it's not the best place.

29:20.219 --> 29:23.607
Some faculty members it may not be the best place.

29:24.920 --> 29:30.328
bring them in with the expectation that we're going to make it like any other place for everybody, the place for everybody.

29:31.330 --> 29:34.515
And I think that's what I would say.

29:35.596 --> 29:44.971
If you could make a major gift to A&M, I usually phrase it, if somebody walked up to you and had you a check for a million dollars, but it has to be passed on to A&M, you decide how it will be spent.

29:46.032 --> 29:49.498
If you were making a major gift to A&M, for what purpose would you want it used?

29:50.579 --> 29:53.003
You know, that's a tough one because

29:53.337 --> 30:22.872
Over the years I've run into a lot of areas that I think are good and I probably though would try to get it to the students some way and I think I've developed a real affinity toward the students that come here under difficult circumstances, financial ones that

30:29.501 --> 30:33.487

30:33.527 --> 30:36.691

30:57.753 --> 31:03.405
But I'd probably be inclined to go toward more Opportunity Award-type scholarships that a lot of Aggies
