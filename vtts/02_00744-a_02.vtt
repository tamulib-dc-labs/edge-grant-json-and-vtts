WEBVTT

00:05.650 --> 00:08.794
And after you left St. Mary's, then what happened? 
Well, that was in 31. I came back here to A&M and

00:11.958 --> 00:16.444
finished up on my degree. And I hadn't gotten my 
degree like I should have. I went off. I had a few

00:23.654 --> 00:28.941
hours, and I was a freshman coach with Roswell 
Higginbotham. freshman coach and we had a very

00:30.288 --> 00:58.455
good team at the end so then I went back to San 
Antonio

00:30.288 --> 00:58.455
and after the finishing that year up I think that 
was 32 and the fall of 32 I helped coach and promoted

00:30.288 --> 00:58.455
games there in San Antonio and and then that in 
April

01:03.262 --> 01:14.612
as a line coach, with the understanding that if he 
won, that I'd be here for, you know, the regular

01:03.262 --> 01:14.612
time. I was, well, it wasn't an intern coach, I 
guess a seasonal coach, with the understanding

01:15.033 --> 01:29.466
that, see, he was on the spot then, although he had 
some pretty good seasons, so I was getting tired of

01:15.033 --> 01:29.466
him. He hadn't won any championships, see? 
Mm-hmm. So I came back over here, we moved, my

01:32.624 --> 01:38.773
family came back over here, and I came over here in 
April for spring training. And then I came back in

01:40.676 --> 01:47.926
mid-August for the varsity season. And we had a 
good season. We had 6-3-1. Tied Texas on Kyle

01:51.591 --> 01:53.354
Field. But that wasn't good enough for the farm 
students, so they just they told Matty that he'd

02:03.202 --> 02:05.925
have to leave. And that's when he went to SMU as 
assistant coach under Morrison. What kind of

02:11.791 --> 02:13.573
coach was Matty Bell? He was a good coach. He was a 
good, sound, fundamental coach and a very likable

02:14.714 --> 02:19.699
man in the practice business. He had a lot to do 
with, you might say, in my life because I did come

02:21.421 --> 02:29.209
back to A&M and got my degree. And then I was his 
assistant here, and what was going on. We would

02:35.216 --> 02:45.129
have gone to North Carolina University, but if 
they hadn't fired Matty before the season was

02:35.216 --> 02:45.129
over. But he was a very good coach, very good sound. 
He was a whole lot like Mr. Bible. Who replaced

02:51.357 --> 02:53.901
Matty Bell then? Homer Norton. Homer Norton came 
on. Yeah, he came on. And Norton tried to hire me

02:56.813 --> 02:59.415
back after I went. Then I left here and went back to 
San Antonio to coach high school for a while. What

03:03.719 --> 03:04.640
high school then? At Black Ridge first as a track 
coach and a line coach, and then I went to Thomas

03:04.660 --> 03:11.505
Jefferson. I had good success there. I had boys 
like Kyle Roten. Oh my, yes. Dick McKissick and

03:18.732 --> 03:22.855
Weldon Humble and Charlie Parker. I got into 
coaching track, and I made probably the biggest

03:27.020 --> 03:30.947
success of my track coaching I did in my football. I 
had a wonderful season over there. Six seasons I

03:33.992 --> 03:46.294
played for the state champions against Odessa in 
1946 in Austin and had one of the biggest crowds I

03:33.992 --> 03:46.294
ever had at a high school game.

03:56.450 --> 03:58.473
There was a coach at SMU. Hayden Frye. Yeah, Hayden 
Frye was their quarterback.

04:05.123 --> 04:08.929
How come you decided not to go to work for Homer 
Norton? Was there any particular reason you

04:08.949 --> 04:11.092
didn't want to go back? When I left here, A&M was 
good to me, and I didn't have really any animosity

04:11.953 --> 04:19.905
toward anybody. But I knew that the coaching in 
colleges was so uncertain. And in 1945, he asked me

04:26.639 --> 04:36.011
to come back over here as one of his assistants, but 
I declined, which was a good move. And then Mr. Bell

04:36.031 --> 04:42.939
wanted me to go to SMU to be his line coach and track 
coach up there, and I declined that too. He just

04:42.959 --> 04:46.203
figured that it was not enough job security. 
That's right. And I did have it in high school,

04:47.265 --> 04:53.052
although the salaries in those days that the 
coaches

04:57.959 --> 05:02.784
So what I was making, so I was athletic director and 
head of football and track coach at Thomas

04:57.959 --> 05:02.784
Jefferson. I won two state track championships 
there and I had some great sprinters for those

05:02.844 --> 05:08.649
days. Charlie Parker, I don't remember, but they 
were boys could run nine, six, nine, seven, which

05:09.270 --> 05:16.136
was unheard of 30 years ago. But, and then I was a 
very good friend of Harry Stadler's and Bill

05:18.178 --> 05:25.705
Carmichael.

05:28.537 --> 05:57.312
And so after I turned down Mr. Norton's,

05:28.537 --> 05:57.312
didn't accept his position here at A&M, and then 
turned down Matty Bell's, well, Harry Stotley,

05:28.537 --> 05:57.312
who was a good friend of mine, we were friends in 
high school circles at that time, and Bill

05:28.537 --> 05:57.312
Carmichael was made athletic director after 
Norton left, and Stotley was made head football

05:28.537 --> 05:57.312
coach. called me several times and wanted me to 
come back over here and I told them no. I was well

06:03.801 --> 06:15.796
situated and they kept calling me and kept calling 
me and finally they caught me at a weak moment in

06:03.801 --> 06:15.796
which it was a good move for me. Did you know Norton 
very well? I knew him pretty well. I did know him.

06:22.363 --> 06:25.527
Mr. Norton, he made a wonderful record here. But 
see, we weren't in the same circles at that time. I

06:30.839 --> 06:31.981
was coaching in high school. I knew him, but we did 
not on too personal. You had no idea what kind of

06:37.490 --> 06:40.214
coach he was? Well, the only thing I can say is he had 
the second best record they ever had at the end.

06:47.927 --> 06:50.992
After Bibles, I guess Norton was the best. But he 
was on his way out. He hadn't won nothing. They

06:53.165 --> 06:56.169
hadn't won a national championship in 39. He was on 
his way out, too. The only friend you have in

06:59.994 --> 07:05.140
coaching is the scoreboard.

07:05.160 --> 07:05.941
At least in college. The very guys that pat you on 
the back and glove you up while they're hiring you,

07:05.961 --> 07:11.408
they're the very ones that kick you out when you 
don't lose. There's only one thing. I hate to say

07:13.250 --> 07:15.073
it, but there's only one thing. It's win and lose. 
Losing, that's what. Yeah. Well, then you came

07:22.122 --> 07:24.344
here in what year? 48. 48. And what was your 
position? Freshman coach. Freshman coach in 48. I

07:29.570 --> 07:30.792
had a good freshman team. How'd you all do that 
here? We won them all except one game when they beat

07:32.253 --> 07:36.678
us, and they would beat us on a long pass. We beat 
Texas and Bryce and TC and SMU. Did you have any

07:41.724 --> 07:45.087
outstanding players on that team? Yes.

07:48.591 --> 07:50.273
Harry did a fine job in recruiting me. Anytime a new 
coach comes in, he does a good job. We had some boys

07:56.145 --> 08:11.365
like Littman,

07:56.145 --> 08:11.365
Bob Smith, Billy Tidwell, and the backfield, and a 
boy like Yale Larry.

08:12.126 --> 08:15.350
I've got a picture of a bunch of those players back 
there. We had a good, sound freshman team who later

08:30.989 --> 08:33.072
And so how long was your freshman coach? Well, in 
48. And then in July, 49, Carl Michael was then

08:34.956 --> 08:40.645
athletic director. And he resigned to accept the 
superintendent. Hey. Hello. This is my wife, Mrs.

08:45.954 --> 08:47.476
Chapman. How are you? Shall I bring you a cup of 
coffee or a Coke? You want a Coke, a cup of coffee? A

08:51.764 --> 08:53.466
cup of coffee would be very nice. Sugar and cream? 
Sugar and cream, please. Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

08:58.917 --> 09:00.279
Okay, lost my train of thought. You were talking 
about... Yeah, we were talking about you were a

09:02.543 --> 09:09.073
freshman coach in 48, and then you said you... In 
July of 49, Mr. Carmichael, who was athletic

09:09.093 --> 09:17.006
director, resigned to become superintendent of 
the school in Bryan. Why that ever chose me, I don't

09:17.026 --> 09:22.234
know, but I guess that made me athletic director. 
It turned out to be a pretty good deal. Yeah, that's

09:24.157 --> 09:25.920
right, a pretty good deal. So you were athletic 
director then? Well, I was athletic director from

09:28.882 --> 09:34.927
48 or 49 up until Brian came here. Then I was 
associate athletic director. Could you tell us a

09:39.732 --> 09:42.574
little bit about this time until Brian got here? 
The coaches you worked for, what was going on?

09:44.596 --> 09:54.625
Well, at that time, when Stidler resigned, Mr. 
Gilchrist was president of the university at that

09:44.596 --> 09:54.625
time. You see, I worked under some very, very 
conservative presidents. What I mean by that,

10:01.665 --> 10:07.752
they said, you make it down there or else don't come 
up here asking us for any money. You see what I mean?

10:08.292 --> 10:14.599
Because they didn't have any money to give us 
because A&M in Texas had to, they were

10:08.292 --> 10:14.599
self-supporting. We didn't get any appropriated 
funds from the state. And well, when I took over the

10:19.865 --> 10:23.970
first thing, wanted to do was to, we had a little old 
press box, you don't know, I haven't seen the

10:24.575 --> 10:29.081
picture. Same pictures of it, yes sir. The old 
press box and we didn't have any, we had an original

10:30.323 --> 10:43.201
stadium which was built in 27 and then I think 
finished in 29 and at that time when I took over we

10:30.323 --> 10:43.201
didn't have any money at all. We just got through, 
Norton had done a good job with, with handling the

10:43.842 --> 10:51.072
money during his, because we had the big stadium 
stadium debts still to be paid off. And at one time,

10:54.773 --> 11:05.266
when I was back there, going back, re-enhancing 
back, I can remember in 33, the state didn't have

10:54.773 --> 11:05.266
any money. I mean, the athletic department didn't 
have any money. They'd give you a voucher. And we

11:09.852 --> 11:14.538
had a very, very small budget to operate on. Sorry, 
I ran a cream this morning.

11:22.540 --> 11:22.920
All right. And I took over where we just finished 
building the dressing rooms underneath the

11:23.882 --> 11:32.412
President's Stadium. And I think we had $25,000 in 
the kitty, and we owed some money.

11:42.605 --> 11:50.995
And like I said before, I have all the highest 
regard for all the presidents of A&M College. they

11:51.886 --> 11:56.177
were conservative, they were minded people 
because they didn't have any money. We hadn't hit

11:57.961 --> 12:02.172
the plateau of earnings coming in like we did 
there. So the first thing I did was to enlarge

12:10.043 --> 12:12.668
enlarged the stadium and put up a few. You don't 
remember when we had 2,600 seats up there in the

12:12.868 --> 12:17.336
press box. Well, this was the new addition that 
came up. It was narrow. That's right. When was this

12:21.643 --> 12:22.885
built? That was built in 1951. I think 1951 or 1952 
at the cost of $350,000. How did you all raise the

12:28.455 --> 12:31.020
money for that? Well, I pole barred it. They said I 
couldn't do it. I'm being a very pessimistic

12:37.358 --> 12:40.482
person anyhow. I tried it, and we sold those 
options out at $50

12:41.864 --> 12:53.718
apiece, I believe. The records, I don't have them 
in the National Labor Department. We raised about

12:58.284 --> 13:02.850
$100,000, and we had a little money. I'd 
accumulated a little money. Now,

13:05.444 --> 13:14.894
I've been known as pretty tight with athletic 
department money, but I wasn't tight with it.

13:15.014 --> 13:16.015
Athletics is a business. Of course, it's just a 
question of have- Either have it or don't have it.

13:19.759 --> 13:21.901
Now, we had just as many scholarships. We had just 
as many coaches. Harry Stoddler had seven or eight

13:23.522 --> 13:25.304
coaches. And we get past Harry's deal, and I'll get 
to others. But you're asking about the finances.

13:31.430 --> 13:34.033
And I borrowed $60,000 from a forum of students. 
And they said, well, no, we don't want to let you. We

13:36.642 --> 13:40.186
don't want you to get the money back or nothing. So 
we hit it pretty lucky because we had a game with

13:40.206 --> 13:46.852
Michigan State that I'd gotten a hold of. And

13:48.374 --> 13:58.404
a streak of luck hit us because it was a televised 
game. Oh, I see. And in those days, you didn't have

13:59.425 --> 14:01.607
to give your, Southwest Conference, 80% of the 
money belonged to you. And that was one reason why

14:07.441 --> 14:10.304
this rule went into effect. I think we got about 
$89,000 out of the game, which was a lot of money in

14:12.327 --> 14:17.052
those days. Certainly. See? And after we played 
the game and we'd gotten all this money counting, I

14:19.956 --> 14:30.008
think we got 120 counting the television rights, 
and Michigan State was a good gate. why we had about

14:30.933 --> 14:32.535
$120,000. Well, the conference then wanted some 
of that money. We told them, well, there's nothing

14:37.061 --> 14:40.946
in your rules and regulations about it. We'll 
divide it with you. So the following year, they put

14:41.767 --> 14:44.330
in this regulation. So I took that money and paid 
it. In two years, the stadium was complete. I think

14:50.778 --> 14:52.420
the press box costs $100,000. And you mentioned 
the good gates. When you're scheduling, games in

14:59.047 --> 15:00.248
advance? Did you all try to look for big draws? Big 
draws. And that's one of the things that the board

15:04.113 --> 15:10.460
of directors always jumped on me about. You see, I 
had LSU, Michigan State, Michigan, Ohio State,

15:10.480 --> 15:19.611
schools like that. We weren't drawing anything. 
Big stadiums up there. And they draw. We weren't

15:24.056 --> 15:26.759
drawing for 15,000, 18,000 people here. We had to 
do it. We had to do it. So those were real money

15:31.110 --> 15:32.412
makers. Money makers in those days. And even 
today, I started the series again with LSU back 10

15:34.995 --> 15:49.391
years ago, 12, 15 years ago, way before I retired as 
athletic director. You know what that game is

15:49.411 --> 15:51.433
bringing in and out? Next year, $150,000. Good, 
good. That's marvelous. Now, what... The last

15:58.480 --> 16:10.999
three years that a contractor got with them, I was 
very much criticized by taking them because you

15:58.480 --> 16:10.999
ought to be playing them up here. Well, LSU 
wouldn't come up here. They play seven games a

16:13.483 --> 16:14.284
year. You know what that's going to mean to us? That 
contract expires in 75 next year. It means that

16:19.332 --> 16:22.937
you've got to supplant that with another game 
about 50,000. And athletic department now...

16:23.097 --> 16:26.142
Mm-hmm. It had been subsidized by the Aggie Club. 
We didn't have the Aggie Club. I organized the

16:33.016 --> 16:36.661
Aggie Club in 1950. You did. How'd that come about? 
How'd you decide? Well, they said they couldn't do

16:38.985 --> 16:41.529
that. Well, I paid off my debt there, and we 
scrounged around and got these good football

16:41.589 --> 16:52.365
games.

16:53.780 --> 17:01.750
Texas had a longhorn club, and SMU had the Mustang 
club, and TCU had the hard and foggy club. So I

17:01.771 --> 17:05.195
organized that, which they said we couldn't do. 
But it didn't amount to too much during those days.

17:08.499 --> 17:18.232
But it was the foundation and the organization of 
it that finally now is without it, we couldn't

17:08.499 --> 17:18.232
operate. That was, I think, organized in 52. Well, 
what you're saying then is you really don't make

17:20.999 --> 17:25.706
enough off the gates to run your athletic 
facility. No. We did it then, those days, by

17:26.828 --> 17:32.256
careful managing of our money. But still, we had 
everything that the other teams had, too. Could

17:36.443 --> 17:40.689
you run through some expenses as to where the money 
goes? In other words, what salaries for coaches?

17:45.296 --> 17:45.837
Now? Yeah, what... You mean now? What you have to 
pay out. Next year, I understand, the budget's

17:49.753 --> 17:53.738
going to be $1,500,000. Mm-hmm. Of that amount, 
now, I haven't got an idea of the budget. I mean, I

17:59.906 --> 18:03.791
haven't seen it, but I imagine close to $500,000 
would be the salary.

18:07.756 --> 18:07.897
Mm-hmm. That's really something. Or if you take 
the scholarships, it would be 200 scholarships,

18:08.918 --> 18:13.204
say, at $1,500. That's how much more. That's 
$300,000. That's $800,000. Mm-hmm. See, like

18:17.294 --> 18:18.376
that. Then you're traveling, I don't know. And of 
course, football really has to carry the load for

18:21.002 --> 18:24.830
all the others, too. That's right. That's right. 
One question that bugs me, does basketball make

18:26.454 --> 18:30.062
enough? No, it doesn't make them enough. It won't, 
because I don't know what the budget for

18:32.808 --> 18:35.654
basketball is. I did have a budget here. I imagine 
the budget for basketball, I mean, don't take this

18:37.240 --> 18:41.626
as accurate because I don't know. I could get it for 
you if you wanted. No, I was just curious to know. I

18:44.450 --> 18:47.214
imagine basketball runs around $100,000. I just 
wondered if they made enough off of basketball

18:47.715 --> 18:50.959
maybe to break even. No. And of course, track makes 
almost nothing. Nothing, and baseball makes

18:54.184 --> 18:55.586
nothing. Nearly nothing. Swimming and golf and 
tennis, they don't make nothing. But the whole

18:59.311 --> 19:07.062
thing is made to the idea of carrying on a complete 
athletic program.

19:10.535 --> 19:12.919
star, well, of course, it makes some money. But you 
see, besides that money, we get a lot of money from

19:13.580 --> 19:18.548
the conference every year. From the television? 
Television. You see, all the television money of

19:20.871 --> 19:28.463
all the teams in the Cotton Bowl money and all that 
goes into the pot. You see? And I think the

19:30.466 --> 19:35.635
department got over $120,000 this year from the 
proceeds from the conference. Well, that

19:35.795 --> 19:37.017
certainly helps. It helps, yeah. Well, I noticed 
this next year we have a nationally televised game

19:38.142 --> 19:43.789
with the University of Texas. Nationally 
televised? Yes, sir. Well, I might explain to you

19:46.712 --> 19:48.294
that. 80% goes to Southwest Conference. That's 
this kitty we have. And then it used to be 4% goes to

19:54.802 --> 19:57.785
NCAA. That's 84%. And then the two competing teams 
divide. Split a little bit. Yeah, 16% of it. And if

20:07.522 --> 20:10.285
it's a national televised game, of course, it's 
worth a lot more. I think $300,000, I guess, over

20:10.385 --> 20:15.150
the round, $300,000. Just on the television. I 
used to know exactly the amount. Well, yeah, I

20:17.753 --> 20:18.994
understand that. Well, now, we were talking about 
the early days. We were up to about 1950, 51, and the

20:21.777 --> 20:26.101
additions to the stadium. Yeah. Can you tell us a 
little more what went on then in succeeding years

20:27.022 --> 20:36.212
and what some of your accomplishments, problems, 
frustrations maybe are? Well, Mr. Stiler

20:37.087 --> 20:42.234
resigned, and then I was confronted with hiring a 
new football coach. You were? Yeah. I was still

20:44.697 --> 20:46.920
athletic director. And I suppose people put 
pressure on you then. Well, it wasn't so much

20:50.304 --> 20:55.130
pressure, but it was the amount of money that the 
administration told me I could pay one. Oh, I see.

20:56.132 --> 20:57.974
What did they pay a football coach in those days? I 
think Stiler was getting $8,500, $10,000. Of

21:02.961 --> 21:04.723
course, that wasn't bad. No. But I went, the 
administration said, now you can hire a football

21:06.533 --> 21:14.501
coach, but he can't be over $3,500. He can't be for 
one year. How come one year? Well, the Norton deal,

21:19.906 --> 21:28.594
you know, they paid out home of Norton, you know, 
and the administration had gone from one extreme

21:19.906 --> 21:28.594
to the other. They had to buy Norton's contract. 
That's right. They bought his contract. Which was

21:31.877 --> 21:32.718
only fair. That's right. That's right. But now I 
had a frustration because I had some fine coaches

21:35.778 --> 21:40.683
that I had interviewed. And when I told them what 
the proposition was, they laughed at me. I'm not

21:47.591 --> 21:49.533
surprised. I said, what's the matter? Are you 
crazy? They didn't tell me that in words, but I

21:52.496 --> 21:57.041
surmised that. So I didn't know what to do. So Mr. 
Williams, who was the athletic council member at

22:00.184 --> 22:03.608
that time, came to me and said, now, you've got to 
get a coach here and get it soon, or else you're

22:04.195 --> 22:11.882
going to have to take it.

22:11.902 --> 22:14.024
So I'd been through this long. I said, well, I don't 
want to stay at College Station one or two years. I

22:17.427 --> 22:21.491
do want to stay here a little longer. So I went to 
Harry Stidler, who was a good friend of mine, and

22:21.511 --> 22:31.860
asked him who would he recommend on the staff

22:21.511 --> 22:31.860
that could fill the shoes of the head coach. And he 
said, well, Ray George, who had a fine background.

22:36.035 --> 22:41.540
He was a USC football player, played professional 
football, and he coached at USC. And he was hired to

22:41.581 --> 22:45.405
start as a line coach. So we hired Ray, I think, at 
8,000 a year.

22:50.971 --> 22:54.054
Well, he was a fine gentleman. And he was best liked 
football coach, I believe, as far as the former

22:54.274 --> 23:00.321
students were concerned. I've heard this. 
Anybody we had here. But he wasn't a coach. Maybe he

23:05.249 --> 23:06.571
wasn't a head coach. He wasn't a head coach, that's 
it. So Ray didn't have such bad. Now we come up to

23:13.299 --> 23:15.041
this 1950. See, it's 49, 50, 51. Let's see, Harry 
quit in 49, 50, 51. It's 51 team which should have

23:22.551 --> 23:25.074
won the conference. That was Steitler's team, 
wasn't it? Yeah. And then he quit in 51. He quit in 50

23:29.119 --> 23:32.283
and 51. Then Ray George for a year. Oh, it's

23:34.493 --> 23:43.645
not important, we can, that's... It's 51, 52, 53, 
and then Brian came in 54. Ray

23:47.791 --> 23:58.746
was a fine gentleman, but he just wasn't a head 
coach. The head coach nowadays, you just can't go

24:00.447 --> 24:06.115
out and pick up a guy and coach the ends over here for 
some school. He has to know the entire functions of

24:06.135 --> 24:19.514
a football team, which includes the offense, the 
defense, the linebacker, the end play, the

24:06.135 --> 24:19.514
quarterback play, the halfback play, tackle 
play, defense, secondary defense. He has to have a

24:19.534 --> 24:21.576
complete vision. If he doesn't, he has to hire 
somebody that does know it and he don't know

24:21.596 --> 24:25.862
whether he knows it or not. So there you are. You're 
in a quandary. But Ray did fine, but then he didn't

24:30.282 --> 24:43.196
have a very good season, so Ray finally, he was a 
nice gentleman, a coach. He was nothing wrong with

24:43.216 --> 24:52.346
Ray at all, but they disposed of him, asked him to 
resign, which he did, and that was a manhunt for the

24:43.216 --> 24:52.346
next coach. Where did Ray George go then? Do you 
remember where he went? He went to work for Mr.

24:55.489 --> 24:58.753
Dunn. Harold Dunn. J. Harold Dunn? J. Harold Dunn, 
who at that time was with the Shamrock Oil Company.

25:06.664 --> 25:17.056
And Ray, he hired him on some building of some 
apartment complexes. But of course, Ray didn't

25:17.076 --> 25:19.079
know anything about that. I think it was just a nice 
way of getting rid of him. Maybe so. And he quit and

25:23.704 --> 25:26.648
finally went back to USC, where I've lost track of 
him. He's probably out in California. Yes, he's in

25:32.568 --> 25:36.093
California. Okay, then we get up to the search for 
the coach after he left. How did that search go?

25:41.520 --> 25:44.745
Well, I was sort of on the spot back in 54. I'd been 
here, I'd be 48, 49, 51, 52, 53. Five years as

25:49.732 --> 25:57.343
athletic director and they actually just didn't 
think that I was very progressive.

26:01.340 --> 26:05.164
So I was given the task of getting a new head 
football coach. So we went to Cincinnati, Ohio. At

26:08.627 --> 26:14.192
that time, a fellow by the name of Mr. Penberthy was 
the chairman of athletic council. And we went up

26:14.212 --> 26:18.356
there, and we interviewed all whole unforgotten. 
Jim Myers was one who later came here. And this guy

26:20.879 --> 26:24.322
coaches the Rams out there. What was his name?

26:28.846 --> 26:30.688
He's now coaching the San Diego Chargers. I should 
know, but I can't think of his name. I know his name

26:34.033 --> 26:38.458
as well as I do my own, but I can't think of it. And we 
interviewed a lot of talent. This guy that's now,

26:43.584 --> 26:48.911
Devine, who's coaching pro football, we 
interviewed him. We practically hired him. But

26:52.676 --> 26:57.562
then, of course, the boys' directors got into the 
picture. And finally, I interviewed Coach

26:57.582 --> 27:00.405
Bryant. And he was where, Kentucky then? I 
interviewed him in Cincinnati. And I told him, I

27:07.618 --> 27:18.588
said, Coach Bryant, I said, I don't have any, can't 
give you any amount of money we can give you, but I

27:07.618 --> 27:18.588
said, we'd like for you to come there. And I said, 
you can have a head coaching job in the athletic

27:18.628 --> 27:21.811
directorial too. I said, as far as I'm concerned, 
because I know I'm on the way out, but I couldn't

27:23.173 --> 27:28.738
make any kind of a deal.

27:31.807 --> 27:43.540
I

27:31.807 --> 27:43.540
came on back and by that time, LSU was trying to hire 
him. But anyhow, they got in touch with him, some of

27:44.080 --> 27:52.930
these foreign students or exes got in touch with 
him and they finally persuaded him to come.

27:56.133 --> 28:00.818
So one day I was trying to hire him and about a week, 
10 days later, he was hiring me. So he had to rehire

28:02.333 --> 28:04.035
you then. That's right. And what was your position 
under Brian? I was associate assistant athletic

28:06.959 --> 28:10.063
director. Which probably means you did all the 
work for the office and he had the title.

28:14.489 --> 28:19.155
Understand he came here also with a contract that 
he got a certain percentage of the gate. Well,

28:19.175 --> 28:21.878
we'll get to that later on.

28:25.722 --> 28:27.985
He's, I call him the man of destiny. I don't care 
where you go, everything you did, you've seen

28:28.405 --> 28:32.510
people like that. Why in the devil can't I do that? 
He does it. What do you call that? Charisma?

28:38.677 --> 28:41.199
Charisma or something. Well, of course, you're 
familiar with when he came here and when he took his

28:41.219 --> 28:50.670
team out to Junction. You know all about that. I've 
been out there. It's a rough place. But he did well.

28:58.877 --> 29:00.299
Coach Brian did well. And this percentage deal 
I'll get on to later, but the

29:00.360 --> 29:12.718
first year, he didn't win but one game, if you look 
at the records. I understand that. The second

29:13.940 --> 29:15.743
year, he did a little better. And the third and 
fourth year, he won the conference one year. But of

29:19.108 --> 29:22.553
course, he was on probation. And of course, he 
couldn't participate. What really got us on

29:24.852 --> 29:29.416
probation without nailing down any names or 
anything? You going to put that in the case? You

29:31.599 --> 29:33.220
don't have to put any names in with it. Well, 
there's a couple of cases. One case was they tried

29:35.322 --> 29:50.717
to prove one of the stars that made Bryant a great 
coach proved that he was bought or given more than

29:35.322 --> 29:50.717
he's supposed to have been given. And then 
secondly was they found out player from South

29:54.485 --> 29:59.993
Texas was given a certain amount of, proved that. 
That he was given certain

30:02.036 --> 30:11.570
things that were not conforming to him with the 
conference rules. I see. Do you think Bryant knew

30:11.971 --> 30:14.134
about this, or? Oh, he knew about it just like Nixon 
knows about Watergate. I see. I see. You can assume

30:22.686 --> 30:23.968
that. I heard a story that he didn't even know that 
he was going to be put on probation until he went up

30:25.518 --> 30:35.547
to a conference meeting and was playing poker with 
some... No, I knew about it in Waco. Of course,

30:35.587 --> 30:39.390
Waco, they announced it when we had the conference 
meeting up there. They announced it after the fact

30:39.410 --> 30:43.394
of the meeting that they were put on probation. But 
I knew it before that he did, actually. I heard a

30:46.736 --> 30:47.377
story. I don't know if it's true that he found out 
one night playing poker with Jess Neely and some of

30:47.417 --> 30:52.521
the rest of them. No, I... Maybe you're correct, 
but of course my only annoying about it was after

30:54.863 --> 31:04.112
the conference meeting. I think it was held in 
Wakefield. Well, how was Brian's brain here? Did

31:08.497 --> 31:10.339
he rule with an iron hand? Yes, he was, he was, his 
players, he ruled with an idea of fear. Players

31:21.169 --> 31:23.672
liked him after he got out, but they thought he was a 
while he was here. He was fair. He demanded 100%

31:27.928 --> 31:32.613
from his players. As far as I'm concerned, my 
relations with him were 100% good because he was

31:34.115 --> 31:44.025
tight with the money, with the department's 
money. He would shake down some of these exes, I

31:44.045 --> 31:46.388
guess. That's what they say. I don't know. He'd 
shake them down. We accumulated some money while

31:49.791 --> 31:53.235
he was here and built Henderson Hall. Of course, 
you had a With winning seasons, don't you make more

31:55.107 --> 31:58.852
money when you've got a winning season? Yeah, but 
there again, we hadn't gotten to the plateau where

31:58.872 --> 32:04.641
A&M was really growing like the next year. They 
ought to have some good crowds out there next year.

32:06.984 --> 32:08.206
Well, we hope so. But it was improving, I'd say, 
tremendously. Yeah, from the first year where you

32:13.914 --> 32:16.598
win one and a little better. So that by 56 and 57, he 
should have been drawing. Well, he was drawing

32:20.043 --> 32:22.026
good, and we were making money. We were making 
money. Had some television games, probably.

32:24.452 --> 32:25.574
Television games. We were making money. When we 
left here, we had some surplus. In fact, in 57, you

32:29.683 --> 32:33.131
did get one bowl game, I believe, with Tennessee. 
Went to Tennessee, and they beat us three to

32:33.312 --> 32:36.218
nothing. I've forgotten what we got out of it, 60, 
75. Of course, any time you can play an extra game,

32:39.908 --> 32:42.615
that's a little more money, too. Well, not 
altogether, because when last year I was here in

32:42.655 --> 32:47.727
67, we played the Cotton Bowl and lost money. You 
did? Yeah. How did you lose money on that? That's

32:50.735 --> 32:52.158
interesting. Gene Stallings just spent money 
like a wild man. Oh, my. I would have thought that

32:56.598 --> 32:58.520
you would have. You see, the things have changed. 
They divided the conference surplus up

33:00.863 --> 33:04.849
differently. In other words, I think you would 
give so much per mile plus $60,000. Now it's

33:09.495 --> 33:10.396
$100,000. So you can spend $60,000 pretty quick if 
you're going to watch yourself. You say spend

33:15.102 --> 33:15.943
money. This was mainly on the team and their 
housing and food. Invited everybody in the

33:21.237 --> 33:24.322
country to come up there on expense. Well, it had 
been a long time since that had ever happened.

33:27.186 --> 33:27.687
That's right. Everybody went crazy. It was first 
class. It was first class. I have no qualms about

33:30.952 --> 33:34.638
that, because I was getting ready to retire. I 
didn't care. Actually, I did care, but it wasn't

33:35.539 --> 33:41.408
the sore spot of mine. You know, there's three 
types of people. There's a type of person that's

33:43.872 --> 33:47.658
tight with his own money, and they spend everybody 
else's money. Is that right? Yes. And there's a

33:50.313 --> 33:53.718
type of guy that's tight with his own money and 
tight with everybody else's money. And there's a

33:54.719 --> 34:02.630
type of person that spends his own money and tight 
with... You see, out there, when I was there, I

33:54.719 --> 34:02.630
figured that that was more or less a... I had to... 
That was a state institution. I had to... It was a

34:08.659 --> 34:11.463
sort of a... A public trust. A public trust is what I 
thought. But you couldn't tell these exes that.

34:16.430 --> 34:18.312
Especially some of the more successful ones. 
That's right. Well, why did Bryant leave? Was it

34:24.494 --> 34:25.356
more money? Well, he told me confidentially that 
you couldn't win at A&M. And I agreed with him. I

34:33.028 --> 34:34.090
mean, consistently. Now, get me wrong. Could you 
explain that? You mean you could maybe have one

34:36.654 --> 34:45.129
good season and then... Well, if you look at our 
records, we have one good season about every 13

34:36.654 --> 34:45.129
years, and then we're at the bottom of the heap, the 
rest of them. Now, why? Well... I'm not against

34:47.637 --> 34:49.419
A&M. I'm an Aggie getting around. Yeah, I agree. I 
just think that maybe if we knew why, I could get a

34:51.362 --> 34:56.890
lot of money over there. Well, I'll tell you why 
Bryant said it was hard to recruit. Well, it was an

35:02.778 --> 35:04.119
all-military school. An all-military school. 
Second, we didn't have girls. Right. And thirdly,

35:08.265 --> 35:10.388
it was how we were situated.

35:14.435 --> 35:16.737
gets on the nerves of all the rest of these schools. 
Why? Because they're jealous of us of what it is? I

35:19.199 --> 35:19.660
don't know. I think there's a certain percentage 
of that. See, jealousy. And because we have a rich

35:23.663 --> 35:29.829
heritage and have so many things that we are proud 
of. I think maybe they don't like us because we're

35:30.309 --> 35:33.272
probably just a little bit clannish. Yeah. We 
stick together. Stick together and clannish. And

35:37.016 --> 35:38.257
we have a rich heritage. And we have a great spirit. 
And no other school has, I don't imagine. Even the

35:43.578 --> 35:49.745
armed service schools, Army and West Point Navy, 
have us closely knitted together. They have a rich

35:49.825 --> 35:53.910
tradition. But this is why he said he left, really. 
It's because you couldn't leave. One reason, I

35:56.993 --> 36:10.969
think, and the second reason was the fact that he 
wanted to go back to Alabama, which he thought

35:56.993 --> 36:10.969
would be a better all-around position than the one 
at the A&M that he could accomplish

36:15.370 --> 36:18.715
being the only school in Alabama except Auburn. 
You see, if you stop and visualize this thing, and

36:20.817 --> 36:32.914
I've always said this, and it's not to say anything 
against schools that are land-grant schools, but

36:20.817 --> 36:32.914
how many land-grant schools have great football 
teams? Can you answer that question? It's

36:37.000 --> 36:37.861
sporadic. They'll come up one year. Purdue comes 
up one year. And then this doubt drops down. But now

36:44.277 --> 36:47.122
how many schools like Ohio State and USC? Well, 
Ohio State's a land-grant school. Yeah, it's

36:49.848 --> 36:52.072
about the only one that you might say. But it was 
made the major university. That's right. It's the

36:54.677 --> 36:55.879
university first. And then the agriculture, it 
seemed like LSU, it's a land-grant school. But

37:00.308 --> 37:01.029
it's the only one. But it's the only university, 
see. I see what you mean. See, it's the only

37:04.636 --> 37:06.640
university. I can't see if we could go ahead and 
have a good, strong program and finish, be at the

37:08.763 --> 37:16.412
bottom. I believe in winning, being competitive. 
But if we can be up there second or third, once in a

37:21.118 --> 37:28.006
while win the conference, that's all we can ask of. 
Yeah, I think so. See? But don't be on the bottom.

37:34.153 --> 37:36.576
Nobody likes that, that's for sure. And as far as 
the utensils or the material and the money and

37:36.826 --> 37:45.320
everything, we spent as much money as anybody 
except the University of Texas. Yeah, they're

37:45.340 --> 37:47.964
having some money problems now, I noticed. That's 
right. Now, after Bryant left, then who came

37:49.546 --> 37:52.832
along? Myers. Myers. Did you hire him? No, it 
wasn't until after Pohlberg left. Oh, I see. Okay.

38:03.758 --> 38:05.460
So you were still assistant athletic director? 
Assistant athletic director. Myers came in here,

38:06.522 --> 38:16.777
it was sort of a shake out between, they were trying 
to hire this guy, Notre Dame, what was his name,

38:06.522 --> 38:16.777
Leahy. Frank? Frank Leahy, he came down here and 
this guy from the Navy came, the Navy coach, I can't

38:18.239 --> 38:31.217
think of his name, but anyhow they all come in here 
just, but it was sort of a shake out. the

38:32.598 --> 38:35.902
administration didn't want to hire some big-time 
coach. I said, yeah, actually, that's what

38:35.922 --> 38:39.506
happened. And so, Meyers, and we talked to Meyers' 
head coach, one of, you said he had died, Red

38:39.526 --> 38:48.858
Saunders, he came in here. We talked to him, we 
talked to May, and we talked to a lot of other

38:48.878 --> 38:52.963
big-time. But the administration didn't want any 
big-time coaching, more coaching. Actually, the

38:56.728 --> 39:02.014
experience with Bryant wasn't bad, but it was, And 
he got along with the administration well, I

39:02.281 --> 39:13.736
thought, but still there's something about him 
that just

39:02.281 --> 39:13.736
turned people against him. And the 
administration, I don't know what it was. Maybe

39:15.859 --> 39:17.641
they couldn't control him. Well, that's what they 
thought. At that time, the president was Dr.

39:20.625 --> 39:28.215
William, I forgot who was the president. Who was 
the president at that time? He got it in there?

39:30.899 --> 39:31.039
Mm-hmm. That would be Harrington for a while 
there, and then Morgan came in 1956. Morgan joined

39:34.867 --> 39:35.808
that, that's right. Morgan and Hinton couldn't 
get along. That's unusual. One thing we might go

39:41.355 --> 39:47.622
back to was the percentage, how Bryant arrived at 
getting the percentage of the gate. Well, after

39:47.642 --> 39:58.636
his first couple of years, we had a coach's house 
over here on Greenview. I don't know whether

39:58.656 --> 39:59.737
you've ever seen it. No, I haven't.

40:03.672 --> 40:06.695
and all they sold. Well, Bryant bought it. Oh, I 
see. He bought the house. So, the trade was made

40:11.060 --> 40:15.405
after Bryant had a pretty successful year to get 
more money. The asset department bought the house

40:16.626 --> 40:25.696
from him, and that stirred up a lot of commotion 
around here, because they paid him more than the

40:16.626 --> 40:25.696
house was worth. You see what I mean? And then he got 
entered in the contract with the board of

40:30.605 --> 40:33.870
directors. The administration wasn't 
responsible for it. Now, whether this was

40:36.574 --> 40:47.610
documented, I don't know, but they guaranteed him 
one-half or one percent of the gross percentage.

40:47.630 --> 40:57.625
In other words, if you made $500,000 gross on your 
football, you'd get whatever you want to figure,

40:47.630 --> 40:57.625
half or one percent of the $5,000 worth. something 
like one, one and a half percent. He was getting

41:01.630 --> 41:04.956
subsidy anyhow out of the deal. If he drew a big gate 
though, he could make a sizeable sum during the

41:04.976 --> 41:08.882
year. That's right. Which was against actually 
the rules and regulations of the Southwest

41:10.244 --> 41:19.780
Conference and also- They knew about it though, 
didn't they? They knew about it. And the college,

41:20.682 --> 41:24.608
the college was one that was actually disturbed 
about it because a state university giving them

41:25.313 --> 41:34.088
coach half of their gate receipts, which actually 
the money went through the athletic department

41:25.313 --> 41:34.088
with state money. See, we were just a subsidiary of 
the college. That drew a lot of concern and a lot of

41:39.657 --> 41:48.071
bad publicity out of that. Excuse me just a minute. 
You want to use the bathroom? You want some more

41:50.095 --> 41:51.557
coffee? Could we talk a little bit about the 
junction thing? Did you ever go out there? No, I

41:56.391 --> 41:57.192
didn't go out there. He left me here. But it was 
very, he went to junction and Dennis Gehringer, I

41:59.655 --> 42:08.546
could tell you, over at the bank, he was one or two. I 
understand that that maybe got the rule put in the

42:08.786 --> 42:13.592
conference that you couldn't leave the campus 
anymore. Why'd they do that? Well, when Brian came

42:15.133 --> 42:20.700
in here, they opened up the eyes of most of these old 
coaches like Dutch Meyer and Mattie wasn't

42:21.237 --> 42:23.881
coaching then, but Jess Neely. Where was Dutch 
Meyer? Over Texas? No, he was at TCU. TCU, okay. And

42:29.889 --> 42:33.394
they took in after him. They thought that he was 
coming over here to... See, up that time, this had

42:33.434 --> 42:40.865
been a very good conference. The athletic 
directors and coaches were very friendly, and

42:41.085 --> 42:45.451
they were on good terms and everything. They 
thought that Brian coming in here, that it was...

42:50.785 --> 43:00.900
erupt into a conference

42:50.785 --> 43:00.900
that was misdealing and breaking the rules and one 
thing or another. But he wasn't fired or anything.

43:03.243 --> 43:04.345
He just wanted to win. I have a high respect for him, 
although

43:06.849 --> 43:12.657
we got along fine. I thought when he actually got 
his athletic director that he just

43:25.582 --> 43:26.465
Yeah, straight. Well, you had to do all the work, 
really, then, all the administrative work. If

43:30.618 --> 43:34.190
you'll excuse me just a minute, I want to shut my 
tape off and change. OK.
