00:03.423 --> 00:15.379
In the upgrading of the facilities, were you, in a 
sense, even though you're still in civil

00:03.423 --> 00:15.379
engineering, was it more of a logistics 
administration? Or was it basically? No, I'm

00:17.662 --> 00:24.351
still in design, construction, operation, and 
maintenance of facilities. OK. OK. The

00:26.834 --> 00:32.502
interesting question that you would ask, because 
shortly after I left the service, they added to the

00:33.443 --> 00:39.411
staff called services, engineering and 
services. And they put the mortuary, the

00:39.431 --> 00:50.746
commissary, the liquor stores, and everything 
else under this course of engineering. Not having

00:51.026 --> 00:52.087
enough to do. This was General Jones did that. He 
made him engineering and services. So he put all

00:57.875 --> 01:00.919
the services under him too. I never experienced 
that. They do now. That sounds like a lot of

01:06.191 --> 01:08.314
responsibility. At that time that I was at 
Wright-Patterson, I was

01:09.095 --> 01:22.654
regional vice president of the Society of 
American Military Engineers for the Ohio region.

01:22.714 --> 01:24.957
The United States is divided into a number of 
regions. So happens Texas is a region all by

01:24.977 --> 01:27.400
itself. But I was a and that comes up later on to 
support something else. We had posts in

01:36.116 --> 01:52.135
Cincinnati and Philadelphia, one down in West 
Virginia, one in Columbus, one at

01:36.116 --> 01:52.135
Wright-Patterson, of course. About six or eight 
posts in the region. Now, is this outside of the

01:55.203 --> 01:57.705
military? Yeah, this is a Society of American 
Military Engineers. It's not

02:03.791 --> 02:14.680
government-funded, but it's made up of Army, 
Navy, Air Force, Marine, military, and civilian

02:03.791 --> 02:14.680
engineers that want to join. Today, there are 
about 20,000 members in the Society. Well,

02:18.844 --> 02:23.708
that's a good idea. Well, why were you only there 
for a year? Here's your last job then, Director of

02:27.287 --> 02:36.162
Facility Maintenance back in Washington with the 
Secretary of Defense. Remember the name

02:36.182 --> 02:37.424
Sheridan? Mr. Sheridan was on the board for the 
expansion of the Air Force Academy. Mr. Sheridan

02:45.578 --> 02:51.147
was escorted to

02:45.578 --> 02:51.147
Comron Bay sheridan was the top engineer in the 
department of defense and he made a request to the

02:52.358 --> 03:22.298
airport i have a vacancy for a director of facility 
maintenance and i want general huck johnson to

02:52.358 --> 03:22.298
fill the job and the department of defense asked 
the airport for somebody by name and the air

02:52.358 --> 03:22.298
force's policy that unless they had a real real 
strong objection grant the Department of Defense

03:22.987 --> 03:27.053
the wish. Mr. Sheridan asked for me by name and 
there wasn't a damn way I could get out of it. I tried

03:31.579 --> 03:32.821
to not go. Why? I didn't want to go to the Department 
of Defense. I didn't want to go back to the airport.

03:38.088 --> 03:40.051
I mean back to Washington. You get in the 
Department of Defense, you're gone from your

03:40.071 --> 03:43.576
service. I was doing what I wanted to do. I wanted to 
work in the airport. And But there wasn't a way I

03:52.113 --> 03:55.157
could do that. That sounds like a lot of 
responsibility. I'm surprised that it's not a

03:57.279 --> 03:59.602
two-star position. You mean in the Department of 
Defense? Yeah. Well, at

04:03.326 --> 04:21.107
that time, the Air Force

04:03.326 --> 04:21.107
had only one two-star civil engineer. And

04:21.560 --> 04:28.468
this was still guttered.

04:31.231 --> 04:39.001
This was Riley, General Riley, Maurice Riley, 
Colorado. He was the only two-star that we had in

04:39.441 --> 04:44.747
the Air Force. Well, why is that? Because the Army, 
the Chief of the Corps of Engineers, was

04:46.429 --> 04:49.573
three-star. That's right. Bear in mind, he has a 
greater responsibility.

05:00.116 --> 05:11.851
The chief of the Corps of Engineers has a 
responsibility that, unless one of them has

05:00.116 --> 05:11.851
defined it for you, it's very difficult to 
understand. He has two responsibilities. He is

05:14.094 --> 05:18.600
responsible to the chief of staff of the Army for 
certain things. And he is responsible to the

05:19.745 --> 05:27.195
Secretary of the Army without going through the 
Chief of Staff for other things. The work that he

05:27.215 --> 05:34.825
does in civil work, the Chief of the Staff of the 
Army has absolutely no sales.

05:38.350 --> 05:49.144
But that's only the Secretary of the Army being the 
titular advisor to the Chief of the Corps of

05:38.350 --> 05:49.144
Engineers. There is, if you put it on a scale, there 
is a star difference. The top Navy man in our

05:57.054 --> 06:02.702
business is a rear admiral upper half. Unless you 
understand that off the tape, I'll tell you about

06:05.165 --> 06:11.474
that because I had nothing to do with it. He's a 
senior two-star admiral. Which is a two-star

06:12.956 --> 06:14.678
admiral. Rear admiral, upper half. Rear admiral, 
lower half, is a one-star. No? Rear admiral, lower

06:19.952 --> 06:25.800
half, in the time of peace. When you look at it, you 
don't know whether he's upper or lower. And

06:28.944 --> 06:42.963
sometimes, when I was in the Department of 
Defense, even, and I'd get into meetings, and a

06:28.944 --> 06:42.963
rear admiral would come in, and it was my job to say, 
upper or lower? If he said lower, date of rank?

06:48.052 --> 06:51.355
Because you've got to establish who is the senior. 
Because what he's wearing, he could be, too. But

06:56.099 --> 06:58.161
you have to look at him and say, up or lower? He says, 
lower. Data rank. And then that tells you which one

07:00.683 --> 07:02.805
of you is the senior. And that's your 
responsibility. Well, when I was the director of

07:07.229 --> 07:11.533
facility maintenance, I had a rear admiral across 
the hall. He had another directorate reporting.

07:14.095 --> 07:15.636
He, too, reported to Mr. Sheridan. But I outranked 
him. But as we walked down the hall, he'd walk on the

07:18.443 --> 07:24.553
right because what he's wearing says he's a 
two-star, but he's not. He's being paid as a

07:24.993 --> 07:26.255
one-star. It's crazy. Only in war do they drop back 
to the comic

07:28.779 --> 07:34.669
books. Yeah, it was a big job. I thoroughly enjoyed 
it. I learned a lot. I got a hell of a lot of exposure.

07:42.040 --> 07:45.666
I already said I worked with the different 
services. Some of the problems with my own were

07:47.097 --> 07:53.425
bigger than with the other, with the Army and the 
Navy. Never had any problem with the Marines.

07:55.787 --> 07:58.451
They're just damn thankful that somebody's 
trying to help them. Oh, they are? Oh, yeah. The

08:05.099 --> 08:16.412
Marines, and I'm not knocking them, rightfully 
so, if you took a percentage of how many of what

08:18.839 --> 08:33.315
percent of the total were available or committed 
to combat, you'd have a greater percent out of the

08:18.839 --> 08:33.315
Marines than you would out of any service. And 
that's what I say. When you get into that old

08:35.357 --> 08:42.946
operation and maintenance, logistical support, 
and design and construction, anybody that wants

08:35.357 --> 08:42.946
to help us, help us. Because they just don't have 
the people there. And, you know, that's the

08:50.615 --> 08:57.121
commandant's choosing, and he's going to put the 
max in. And back to my own boss, when I was back there

08:58.062 --> 09:14.697
at Turner, he said, you can listen to your own 
people say that they want to have their own design

08:58.062 --> 09:14.697
and construction agents and push the core out of 
the building, but not while I'm here. Because,

09:15.758 --> 09:19.221
number one, we don't have the manpower to devote to 
that And number two, as long as the Corps of

09:20.247 --> 09:28.856
Engineers is responsible for it, if it goes wrong, 
we've got somebody else to blame.

09:28.876 --> 09:33.702
And he said, but we don't have the manpower spaces 
to put into it. It's all we can do to keep air crews.

09:37.206 --> 09:37.566
Right. Well, how are your relations with the Corps 
of Engineers? Oh, mine, always great. Really

09:43.492 --> 09:44.093
good. Oh, yeah. No problems. I've never had 
problems. No jealousies? No. Never. And even to

09:52.274 --> 10:01.206
this day, I've got two major general friends that 
live right here in San Antonio, and the greatest

09:52.274 --> 10:01.206
people ever. One of them was the number two man in 
the Corps, and the other one was the top engineer in

10:01.226 --> 10:14.964
the Ohio River

10:01.226 --> 10:14.964
Division when I was at Wright-Patt.

10:17.187 --> 10:21.152
So in general, would you say that the Corps of 
Engineers and the engineering groups, of course,

10:21.605 --> 10:28.817
of the Air Force and the Navy, do they work together 
fairly well? Yeah. You know, sometimes they're

10:32.022 --> 10:33.745
misunderstanding. Sometimes the auditors have 
to get with each other and battle over dollars and

10:33.865 --> 10:40.916
stuff like that. But I personally... can see only 
one way of improving it, but it would never come

10:45.280 --> 11:00.341
about, and that would be to abolish it all, as the 
Canadians have done, and have only one agent,

10:45.280 --> 11:00.341
period. Don't have Army principally, Navy in some 
parts of the world, and Air Force in England, or the

11:00.361 --> 11:08.392
United Kingdom. Why won't they do that?

11:12.820 --> 11:27.402
I think we've got other problems, you know, just 
nobody willing to tackle that one or else nobody

11:12.820 --> 11:27.402
wants to tackle it because the Corps is so involved 
also in civil work. Sure, absolutely.

11:31.348 --> 11:38.980
And of course there are people who think that now is 
just about the time that the Corps ought to invest

11:31.348 --> 11:38.980
itself in civil work because You're beginning to 
see more and more articles in the technical pubs

11:39.230 --> 11:55.086
and even in the media of some of the breakdowns and 
the failures that have happened in the Corps and

11:39.230 --> 11:55.086
are now surfacing.

11:55.106 --> 11:58.008
Now what were your responsibilities here then in 
your last job?

12:00.671 --> 12:07.718
Principally policy making and budget review of 
the budget review that is submitted by the four

12:08.761 --> 12:15.651
services. Annually when they come in for their 
operation and maintenance appropriation, how

12:15.671 --> 12:34.917
much they would have budget for the operation of 
utilities and the maintenance of facilities and

12:15.671 --> 12:34.917
the same thing for housing and so on. Of course, our 
review would I don't know if it would come as any

12:39.457 --> 12:41.219
surprise. We'd be constantly trying to get the 
service to raise that budget level. Of course,

12:47.547 --> 12:53.294
every time you try to get them to raise it, well, 
it's got to come from somewhere else because

12:47.547 --> 12:53.294
somebody's got a ceiling on them. But hey, man, 
that's not enough to keep these things from

12:53.314 --> 12:56.478
falling apart. Come on, you've got to get more than 
that. Let's get it up. Let's get it up. Let's get it

13:00.543 --> 13:00.903
up. But it comes in in so many different elements 
and line items that it takes a hell of a long study to

13:00.923 --> 13:09.193
go through and then determine that, Okay, you're 
probably marginal, or okay, and you're good, or so

13:09.663 --> 13:14.249
on. But that's the budget we need. And policy, oh, 
it can come in any different form. For instance,

13:23.120 --> 13:39.400
during my tenure, Congress, in its wisdom, 
eliminated so many enlisted aides As a

13:41.708 --> 13:51.280
general rule,

13:41.708 --> 13:51.280
a flag officer got an aide for each star. Then

13:52.922 --> 14:00.873
Congress said, look how many enlisted people 
we've got. They're doing nothing except waiting

14:00.893 --> 14:04.878
on generals and admirals. Let's come out.

14:15.155 --> 14:20.220
When I say in his wisdom, they didn't realize 
really who this hurt. Because first you have to

14:20.240 --> 14:23.102
live in government quarters to have an aid. If you 
live on the economy, you don't get an aid. You have

14:25.905 --> 14:28.347
to live in government quarters. So the guy out 
there on the economy, he didn't have one. But now

14:33.953 --> 14:39.718
this guy that's living in government quarters, he 
cut out the aid.

14:43.421 --> 14:44.082
And here's This is a true estimate. So then the 
servants come to you and say, hey, who's going to

14:46.311 --> 14:53.241
cut this guy's grass? This brigadier general 
says, who's going to cut his grass?

14:59.851 --> 15:06.281
Well, who's responsible for having the grass cut 
before the aid was lost? Well, the aid is. I said,

15:07.062 --> 15:09.086
I'm going to ask you the question again. Who's 
responsible for having the grass cut before that

15:13.863 --> 15:17.829
aid authorization is withdrawn? Oh, the 
generalist. I said, who is responsible for having

15:19.412 --> 15:27.385
the grass cut after the aid authorization is 
withdrawn? Well, the generalist. Then you've

15:30.190 --> 15:31.912
answered your question. Oh, really? You're 
telling us the general's going to cut the grass? I

15:34.416 --> 15:35.037
said, no. I phrased it. Who is responsible for 
having the grass cut? Now, if the general wants to

15:41.183 --> 15:43.366
go cut the grass, that's all right. If he wants to 
have his son do it, all right. If he wants to hire the

15:45.309 --> 15:51.637
kid across the street, or if he wants to hire this 
black guy that comes on base and cuts everybody's

15:45.309 --> 15:51.637
grass, that's all right. Well, would you permit 
the general officer's landscaping to be included

15:53.720 --> 16:08.220
in the civil engineer's landscaping budget for 
the common grounds? I said, do I look like a guy

16:10.343 --> 16:17.091
that's going to go over there on the Hill before 
Congress and say, yes, I was the one that

16:10.343 --> 16:17.091
authorized that?

16:19.914 --> 16:23.478
I said, do you really think that I'm that much of a 
fool? You know, you and me, this is all going on in 45

16:23.658 --> 16:28.423
seconds. But this is a three- or four-week 
dialogue of back and forth between services. It

16:34.049 --> 16:36.232
all mellows down to this. So the policy is, they'll 
handle it. They wanted you to send men over to cut

16:39.200 --> 16:42.404
their grass. Hard to let me raise, put it in the 
budget. And the intent of Congress, take the aid

16:47.109 --> 16:58.502
away,

16:47.109 --> 16:58.502
and then I'm going to turn around and say, oh, but 
we'll spend the money some other way? Not me, Dad.

17:01.245 --> 17:03.908
I'll say not only I would not do it, But if I find it in 
the budget, I know what your grounds are now. And if

17:07.559 --> 17:10.322
I find it in there, my people will cut it off. But, 
you know, these are real small things. But before

17:16.950 --> 17:24.499
the committee of Congress, you could get a number 
of people crucified. Sure.

17:28.164 --> 17:33.490
Well, like I say, short conversation here, but 
this is three or four weeks of four services, and

17:34.043 --> 17:39.548
then we also knew that they'd have maybe two or 
three meetings. Well, now, look, we'll go over

17:39.708 --> 17:48.576
there tomorrow and talk to them like this, and 
y'all go over there the next day, and...

17:48.596 --> 17:49.497
So what happened? Did the generals have to find 
somebody? The generals remained, like I said. Who

17:53.920 --> 17:54.981
was responsible? So they were responsible. 
That's right. They cut it themselves, or somebody

17:56.863 --> 17:58.925
did. Or they hired somebody to do it. Congress took 
their aid away. Congress didn't tell you you had to

18:02.933 --> 18:07.579
go cut grass.

18:07.599 --> 18:17.631
We were about to have you as a colonel living next 
door to me, and the civil engineer would come cut my

18:07.599 --> 18:17.631
grass, but tell you, Colonel, sorry, we can't cut 
your grass. You're a colonel. You know, what in the

18:19.934 --> 18:21.455
hell would that do? Yeah, great for my own. But,

18:24.319 --> 18:27.743
uh,

18:31.857 --> 18:36.481
What other challenges?

18:36.501 --> 18:57.201
Well, the good news part, of course, was

18:36.501 --> 18:57.201
there was an

18:36.501 --> 18:57.201
Army Corps of Engineers general, and you probably 
have him on your list, Andy Rollins. Is Andy in

18:57.381 --> 18:58.742
Texas? Have you interviewed him yet? No, I have 
not. I've written him a letter. Andy was the number

19:03.787 --> 19:07.150
two man of the Corps of Engineers. And I won't say 
much about it, because you probably won't. And

19:11.495 --> 19:16.821
everybody thought Andy was going to be promoted to 
three stars as Major Chief of Engineers. And is he

19:18.623 --> 19:19.924
here in San Antonio? I don't think so, no. We've 
looked him up, but I don't think so. But you know

19:24.630 --> 19:25.631
him? Yeah. Oh, yeah. I was wondering why he hasn't 
responded. He

19:28.810 --> 19:35.857
was the Vice President of the Society of American 
Motor Engineers. And the Vice President usually

19:37.599 --> 19:43.245
ascends to become the President the following 
year. And when the announcement was made that

19:43.265 --> 19:53.555
General Gribble was going to be moved into the 
Corps and made the Chief, Andy says, I quit. I've

19:53.575 --> 19:54.436
had enough time. See, I can't get promoted. And 
turned to the society and said, I can't accept the

19:58.122 --> 20:09.612
position of president because it could interfere 
with my taking a real good position somewhere. And

20:09.632 --> 20:14.917
so how, all of a sudden, they were without somebody 
to go in. And this was just at the time that I moved

20:14.977 --> 20:18.360
into Washington. So they came to me and said, look. 
The society came to you? Yeah. I made it clear. They

20:23.064 --> 20:28.129
came to me and said, look, you've been a reasonable 
vice president before. becomes the president. I

20:31.068 --> 20:33.971
said, well, I'll ask my boss and my wife, but not in 
that order. He'd say, yes. Yeah, I'll take it. So he

20:39.278 --> 20:40.059
said, yes. Boy, Sheridan was great. He says, 
great. Greatest thing that ever happened. Good

20:45.125 --> 20:48.128
that we got somebody in the Department of Defense 
for a change. It's always been in the Army, Air

20:48.148 --> 20:52.694
Force, or Navy, and now we got somebody in the 
Department of Defense. He says, anytime you want

20:53.775 --> 20:55.197
to travel, travel to be sure that while you're on 
that trip you do some business for the Department

20:55.598 --> 21:00.685
of Defense though. Great. Okay, good. We did it. So 
did you travel quite a bit? Oh, yeah. Did you give

21:06.272 --> 21:08.596
any talks? Oh, yeah. And the department gave you 
time off for this? I sandwiched it in with work

21:11.640 --> 21:17.067
every time that I went somewhere. had it pretty 
well planned two or three weeks in advance and

21:17.654 --> 21:22.180
always had something to do. You see, the Army, I 
mean, the Department of Defense has a lot of agency

21:22.280 --> 21:32.273
of its own, you know, Defense Mapping Agency.

21:32.293 --> 21:41.605
They've got agencies scattered everywhere that 
don't report to Army, Navy, Air Force, don't

21:32.293 --> 21:41.605
report to one of the three services. They report 
right back to the Department of Defense. Like

21:44.958 --> 21:50.924
they've got a place they lovingly call the Pants 
Factory in Philadelphia. They manufacture

21:50.944 --> 21:55.088
uniforms for all the services. Now, all of the 
uniforms are not manufactured there, but enough

21:55.108 --> 22:04.678
are that they know what to contract for and how much 
they ought to cost when they contract for them and

21:55.108 --> 22:04.678
so on. And if they have a special uniform or 
something, it's manufactured in Philadelphia.

22:09.082 --> 22:13.767
Well, that outfit reports back to the Department 
of Defense, not to one of One time it's commanded by

22:14.675 --> 22:23.105
a two-star Air Force, next time by a two-star Army, 
and then by an Avro, it floats around. But anyway,

22:23.745 --> 22:28.211
there was enough business to keep it. So that was 
the plus mark. I mean, it was great. It was a real

22:34.318 --> 22:37.281
good thing. Sheridan was outstanding in the 
support. And when we had our annual meeting the

22:42.822 --> 22:48.508
year I was president, well, I thought it was held in 
Houston. I was little. I wanted it somewhere in

22:51.211 --> 23:06.447
Texas,

22:51.211 --> 23:06.447
and I figured Houston was a good place to have it. 
Why'd you decide to retire in 1974? I'll be very

23:08.990 --> 23:10.652
honest. I had sat

23:13.113 --> 23:31.764
at my position in my position in the Department of

23:13.113 --> 23:31.764
Defense for two cycles, but it's two general 
officer promotion cycles. And it didn't come to

23:31.784 --> 23:39.357
be, and I went down to talk

23:42.374 --> 24:05.749
guy that i knew real well and he was the number two 
man in personnel business and i said god uh what do

23:42.374 --> 24:05.749
the tea leaves have and he says well he says i know 
you're disappointed that you didn't get quoted i

23:42.374 --> 24:05.749
said well i'd be foolish to say that i wasn't 
disappointed but i said john I'm one grade higher

24:06.134 --> 24:14.505
than I ever expected to be, and I'm glad of it, but 
I'm wondering about the future. And he said, well,

24:14.525 --> 24:17.569
you're going to stay at the Department of Defense 
one more year. And I said, and then what? He said,

24:21.074 --> 24:29.065
and then we'll bring you out and make the command 
civil engineer out of you. In other words, give you

24:29.085 --> 24:30.567
your own command. No, that's what I'd already 
been. So I told him, I said... A command is like SAC,

24:34.923 --> 24:40.909
Air Force Logistics Command. I said, John, I've 
already been the command engineer of Air Force

24:40.929 --> 24:49.197
Europe, of the Air Force Logistics Command. I 
said, what other carrot could you give me? And he

24:54.702 --> 24:56.243
said, well, you could give me SAC. I said, I don't 
think that's as big a carrot as a log command. Well,

25:02.834 --> 25:06.358
you asked what the tea leaves said. I said, well, at 
least you're honest with me. If I want out now, what

25:09.300 --> 25:11.002
do you say? I'd like to have six months. And I said, 
all right. You'd like to have six. What if I give you

25:16.448 --> 25:17.549
five? I can live with five. Okay. I said, but now 
before I walk out of here, I want to tell you

25:23.395 --> 25:27.178
something. I said, I'm the third Air Force general 
that just sat in that job down there. It's never

25:32.180 --> 25:36.685
been rotated to the Army or the Navy or the Marines. 
They've hit the Air Force three in a row. From the

25:43.654 --> 25:47.798
inside, I can't see that we're gaining a thing. 
They've not given us a thing. All they're doing is

25:50.602 --> 25:55.047
just robbing the Air Force of one general officer. 
We don't get any more. We don't get any more. Beep up

25:57.965 --> 26:01.910
in an authorization, or you don't get one more 
because you're furnishing them. It comes out of

26:02.010 --> 26:06.817
our heart is to have any gentlemen we can have, and 
we've furnished three in a row now. That's over a

26:06.857 --> 26:10.662
period of eight years. I said, next time I can tell 
them

26:12.765 --> 26:17.351
no. All right. Let me think about that. So the next 
time did the job go? When I left, I recommended to my

26:23.138 --> 26:26.723
Army full colonel, be given the job. As a very dear 
general. No. Jobs don't give you the promotion.

26:35.045 --> 26:39.070
Promotions are work no matter what your job is. 
You're given the job. He was given the job. He sat in

26:41.613 --> 26:43.094
that job two years. He's still full colonel today. 
And sure enough, he's here. Department of Defense

26:49.872 --> 26:54.437
asked the Air Force, and the Air Force said, sorry, 
we don't have them. We can't give you one this time.

26:56.339 --> 26:57.020
They turned them down. It didn't cost them a thing. 
They just turned them down. They haven't been hit,

27:01.705 --> 27:04.489
you know, their budgets haven't been cut. They 
haven't been nasty. I don't know why. And I had

27:06.911 --> 27:10.155
talked to John a couple of times, you know, after 
that. And he said, well, I took your advice, and we

27:10.315 --> 27:13.719
told them no. I said, as a result, we've got one more 
gentleman in the Air Force. He said, that's right.

27:18.779 --> 27:24.608
It's an important job, but we were just losing the 
job. Now, during that job, you were working with

27:26.270 --> 27:30.637
the Secretary of Defense quite a bit. How'd you get 
along with him? Well, he's far removed. You've got

27:34.763 --> 27:43.757
to remember that the Secretary of Defense is a 
member of the Cabinet, and he's a member of the and

27:46.370 --> 27:50.116
everything, and you really don't see him. Of 
course,

27:50.476 --> 28:10.167
you feel him,

27:50.476 --> 28:10.167
but I've got the truth to say that in the capacity 
that he was in, I never saw him there. Our

28:11.159 --> 28:17.567
illustrious governor of Texas was the guy that ran 
the Department of Defense. How'd you get along

28:18.188 --> 28:21.993
with Clements?

28:24.477 --> 28:27.160
He's all right. I never did have to deal face to face 
with him because there were two people between me

28:29.283 --> 28:36.272
and him.

28:41.618 --> 29:08.685
The job of operation and maintenance of 
facilities, though it's a damn important job as

28:41.618 --> 29:08.685
far as dollars are concerned, and what we have to 
use if we have to fight the

28:41.618 --> 29:08.685
manpower and weapons policies just occupy more of 
people's time and effort.

29:08.845 --> 29:11.187
And I say that's the reason That's the reason they 
have us experts do the other things. And I'm

29:18.155 --> 29:19.177
serious. They give you all the rope and say, man, 
you know, go. Because, really, they're just too

29:22.762 --> 29:31.053
damn busy

29:22.762 --> 29:31.053
fighting. Manufacturers, Douglas, Northrop, 
you know, they've got more to do. I don't see how

29:39.224 --> 29:41.848
some of them ever make it with us. Talk about 
people. Sure, we can put in long hours, but ours are

29:44.435 --> 29:47.539
long and tedious. But theirs are grueling and 
trying

29:47.559 --> 29:57.212
to keep from getting screwed.

30:00.877 --> 30:11.532
Of course, during this time, Watergate was on 
everybody's mind in Washington, D.C., and I was

30:00.877 --> 30:11.532
wondering if Watergate and the resignation of 
Richard Nixon and in 74, which was the same time

30:11.917 --> 30:25.915
that you retired, if that had any impact on the 
Pentagon, any feelings at the Pentagon or in your

30:11.917 --> 30:25.915
department? Well,

30:26.877 --> 30:37.671
I don't think it had any.

30:43.000 --> 30:49.450
on

30:43.000 --> 30:49.450
efficiency or anything like that. But it was 
there, and there were a lot of people in the

30:49.530 --> 31:08.080
Department of Defense at the senior level that had 
been brought in by the Democratic Party years ago,

30:49.530 --> 31:08.080
even though they were civil servants. For 
instance, this guy Sheridan asked for me by name

31:08.515 --> 31:15.442
that I worked for directly. Openly criticized the 
Republicans all the time. He was a Democrat. And of

31:19.826 --> 31:25.892
course, being a military guy, I listened to him in 
New Orleans and whatever. I thought it was right

31:26.713 --> 31:28.234
politically. But I don't think it had any effect on 
efficiency. Or should we go get something to eat?

31:40.597 --> 31:40.777
Yeah. As far as I can see, we're basically done with 
your career, unless you have other things that

31:41.318 --> 31:51.795
you'd like to talk about, and we can talk about 
those after lunch. All right. We'll talk a few

31:52.697 --> 31:54.880
minutes after lunch. Maybe there's some things on 
your notes

31:54.900 --> 32:00.209
that you don't know. Okay. His name is Captain 
Harvey Lively. L-I-V-E-L-Y. Okay, he is the

32:03.664 --> 32:10.086
attack officer during the cavalry on tape number 
one, and we'll edit that in. Yeah, okay. Okay.

32:12.434 --> 32:14.922
Also, you asked the question... When I went with 
the A&M football team out to California to play

32:15.492 --> 32:32.294
UCLA, that was not the first time that I'd been out 
of Texas because that particular maneuver was

32:15.492 --> 32:32.294
just three or four months before that in the New 
Mexico. Okay, so that was the first time that you'd

32:32.354 --> 32:35.078
been out of Texas. We'll edit that in, too. When you 
think back on your military career, And I know that

32:43.336 --> 32:46.059
we've alluded to this, but we haven't answered 
this. You said that the way that you were promoted

32:47.721 --> 32:53.708
was because of work. Did you think that you had some 
control over your promotions? I mean, in all

32:58.694 --> 33:08.746
advancement, it seems to me that there is a certain 
amount of luck and a certain amount that the

32:58.694 --> 33:08.746
individual accomplishes. And I was wondering, as 
far as you're concerned, what's your opinion? of

33:13.424 --> 33:19.791
which one is more important?

33:19.811 --> 33:21.853
Between the two? Being there at the right time or 
hard work? Well, in the Air Force, since we do not

33:25.337 --> 33:42.216
have branches of service, all of what's known as 
the line of the Air Force compete with each other.

33:42.398 --> 33:55.750
That means the pilot competes with the supply 
officer, who competes with the maintenance

33:42.398 --> 33:55.750
officer, who competes with the civil engineer, 
who competes with the adjutant or the

33:42.398 --> 33:55.750
administrative officer with the personnel. 
Those are all the line of the Air Force. And they

33:57.812 --> 34:01.456
compete against each other. Doctors compete 
against doctors. Chaplains against chaplains.

34:05.279 --> 34:08.722
But the rest of us being line of the Air Force. And so 
by... use of the Central Promotion Board, which,

34:12.250 --> 34:39.050
incidentally, all meet at Randolph, and the 
boards having only records and written

34:12.250 --> 34:39.050
recommendations to look at, except

34:12.250 --> 34:39.050
in the time of war, and there is a difference, sure, 
performance is the key to promotion. Because

34:39.410 --> 34:41.413
that's what you're graded on, even if the grades 
are skewed high, the written word is there to back

34:41.883 --> 34:49.133
it up. And if a board gets concerned that, man, for 
the last three years they've been going overboard

34:49.353 --> 34:59.086
and fireballing everybody, let's go back and see 
what the written word is. Well, it takes them

34:59.106 --> 35:01.429
longer, but it's there to look at. And so 
performance always in time of peace. In time of

35:08.078 --> 35:11.282
war, in other words, if Got to be in a position 
vacancy to get a promotion. Well, certainly, it's

35:16.795 --> 35:22.002
being in the right place at the right time. Now, you 
are in the civilian world in your own business, as a

35:22.042 --> 35:28.630
matter of fact, for half a dozen years. Do you think 
that getting ahead, advancing in the military,

35:35.056 --> 35:45.088
Are there differences or similarities between 
advancing and any other bureaucracy, like the

35:35.056 --> 35:45.088
corporate world, for example?

35:45.108 --> 35:45.168
No. Again, time of peace, no. Did you consider 
yourself ambitious? Yes.

35:55.220 --> 35:58.144
Very much so. Always discussing it. There wasn't 
something to do. Always looking for something.

36:02.169 --> 36:03.310
We've got to do more. We've got to do more with less. 
This is especially true after I returned to duty,

36:07.237 --> 36:20.289
that I was trying to do it for less cost. I don't care 
whether it's manpower measured in hours or

36:20.309 --> 36:31.200
positions or dollars or what, but do it cheaper. As 
well and cheaper or better. Being

36:34.928 --> 36:36.299
class-dependent. Hmm? Being class-dependent. 
Cross-conscience always. Back to, again, what

36:40.733 --> 36:44.416
General Metten said about the two of them. These 
are the only two guys that ever met a payroll. The

36:47.319 --> 36:53.324
only guys that ever realized that if it doesn't 
pay, it ain't worth it. Somebody's got to pay for

36:53.344 --> 36:55.386
it. And sometimes, politicians especially, will 
talk about all the waste there is in the Department

36:55.646 --> 37:07.536
of Defense, and if you really want to take a look at 
waste, let's take a look at the budget of the

36:55.646 --> 37:07.536
Department of Defense, blah, blah. You've 
probably heard this ad nauseum. And I was

37:09.978 --> 37:13.102
wondering what you thought about that.

37:16.567 --> 37:19.551
Well, I'd like to look and see who those people are. 
Because... Which people? That are saying that.

37:26.441 --> 37:28.203
Who the people are that are saying that. Because I 
am convinced that with the review and the ringer

37:28.223 --> 37:38.297
that the sub... committee the military 
appropriation subcommittee of the house

37:38.868 --> 38:07.525
appropriation subcommittee the ringer that they 
put us through and the review and the records that

37:38.868 --> 38:07.525
they call for and the hours of testimony that we 
have convinced somebody that we're doing as good a

37:38.868 --> 38:07.525
management job as the state of the union will 
permit us to do now two years from now a year from now

37:38.868 --> 38:07.525
it might be different you know it might be some 
knowns that we didn't know when we went before the

38:07.724 --> 38:36.297
committee but you know you've got a house 
appropriation committee that covers all of

38:07.724 --> 38:36.297
appropriations but the military appropriation 
the sub committee for military appropriation is

38:07.724 --> 38:36.297
the one that deals solely with the department of 
defense with all the branches with all the

38:07.724 --> 38:36.297
agencies and everything they have that committee 
has a staff And the longer that staff deals with the

38:36.968 --> 38:46.678
services and the agencies, the more they know 
about them, the more they know what to ask for. And

38:46.899 --> 38:56.709
I would just like for some of these other people to 
just sit in on some of the reviews and hearings

38:46.899 --> 38:56.709
before they sign them. The Department of Defense 
is a big whipping boy. Yeah. I'd be the last one to

39:02.956 --> 39:09.227
say that there's not some kind of saving somewhere 
in the Department of Defense. Anybody that says

39:09.308 --> 39:15.239
that bit, boom. Have you ever heard the term, and 
this is often used by politicians or by

39:15.259 --> 39:24.255
journalists, have you ever heard the term 
military mentality?

39:30.935 --> 39:32.337
I don't know that I have. Well, that there's an army 
way to do something, you know, or... Well...

39:32.357 --> 39:40.408
People in the military have certain opinions. 
That's synonymous with... That's close enough to

39:40.428 --> 39:48.339
the government

39:40.428 --> 39:48.339
essence. Is there a military way of thinking?

39:53.206 --> 39:54.288
I don't think so. Not unless you're talking about 
somebody that's... They just advise that they

39:56.635 --> 40:04.424
think that their service is the only one that can do 
something and that nobody else can do it. I'm sure

40:05.525 --> 40:15.878
that at one time or another some Air Force, maybe 
even a gentleman, said, well, the Navy doesn't

40:05.525 --> 40:15.878
know how to fly fighter aircraft. Well, they 
don't. They fly them just as well in the Air Force.

40:20.824 --> 40:23.807
They fly them under different conditions in 
different locations. No, I don't think

40:26.437 --> 40:34.908
there's really a military way of thinking about 
it. In your entire career, were there some

40:34.948 --> 40:47.365
shortcomings, some things that you wanted to 
accomplish that you thought were just, I mean, you

40:34.948 --> 40:47.365
tried, but they were out of your reach for a number 
of different reasons?

41:04.861 --> 41:18.033
I don't think there were any major consequences

41:04.861 --> 41:18.033
when I was first assigned to the Pentagon. You 
know, again, the Pentagon has got the quotations

41:18.434 --> 41:22.257
around it. Coming out of England as chief of the 
master planning branch.

41:30.525 --> 41:32.667
Actually, I wasn't in the Pentagon. My boss was in 
the Pentagon. My branch was on paper. We were under

41:38.395 --> 41:41.639
the headquarters of the US Air Force. But we were 
downtown on the Mall. I was within two blocks of the

41:46.144 --> 41:50.769
Capitol.

41:52.110 --> 42:02.121
And I knew good and well that to increase our 
efficiency, we belonged over there in the

41:52.110 --> 42:02.121
Pentagon, in that building. Spending too many man 
hours with my people going back and forth on the bus

42:02.692 --> 42:10.303
to attend meetings or coordinate papers and 
things like that. Whereas if we were in the

42:10.363 --> 42:20.458
Pentagon, we would have had as much as maybe two 
more man spaces. We were just losing that much of

42:20.498 --> 42:22.802
time. And it just beat the daylights out of me. And I 
just couldn't live with it. I wasn't having much

42:30.350 --> 42:37.138
luck from my own boss in trying to get in, so I went 
over his head. He didn't know it, but I went around

42:37.158 --> 42:43.045
him and started working with his boss to see if 
there was some way we could get in. I accepted the

42:43.105 --> 42:57.842
fact that we would go in with about half the space 
that an individual is normally authorized and

42:43.105 --> 42:57.842
that I personally wouldn't ask for any more space 
for six to eight months after we got in, but then

42:43.105 --> 42:57.842
started trying to improve our lot, which is what we 
did. We just actually moved into some of these six

43:01.447 --> 43:07.275
by eight foot offices that we were talking about 
earlier. And then that was after I was there about a

43:07.295 --> 43:10.920
year, and I got them in. And then about a year later, 
we got sufficient space for what we're

43:11.782 --> 43:18.751
authorizing. A master planner has got to have a 
desk. He's also got to have a drawing board. He does

43:23.197 --> 43:27.964
a hell of a lot of work on the table.

43:28.855 --> 43:37.490
I explained this to my people, and they were all for 
it, because they didn't like riding the buses any

43:28.855 --> 43:37.490
more than I like for them to be riding the buses. But 
I'm talking about, I had working for me eight

43:37.510 --> 43:50.172
GS-14s, which was a hell of a lot of pay, you know, in 
that day and time, and even today. put them riding a

43:50.911 --> 43:55.178
bus for a couple hours a day, and you just throw the 
money down the drain. You sure are. But that was

43:55.839 --> 43:57.381
probably... But you accomplished that. Huh? You 
accomplished the move then to the Pentagon. Oh,

44:00.687 --> 44:13.267
yeah, but it was frustrating the first year, you 
know, and then having to take substandard to get

44:00.687 --> 44:13.267
in, I wasn't satisfied.

44:13.287 --> 44:16.412
No, I don't think that there's any... thing that I 
was asked to do or any assignment that I was given

44:16.966 --> 44:25.977
that didn't have some degree of success. On

44:25.997 --> 44:44.138
the other hand, was there an assignment that you 
had, a job that you had, that you would consider,

44:25.997 --> 44:44.138
that you accomplished, that you would consider 
one that was sort of your favorite? Are you felt

44:45.097 --> 44:48.662
best about achieving this victory?

45:00.359 --> 45:13.618
Well, there were, I guess there

45:00.359 --> 45:13.618
were two or three that I don't know which one would 
be more prominent. We discussed the construction

45:14.240 --> 45:22.391
of the base in Vietnam was by far probably one of the 
greatest magnitudes. But going to the United

45:22.511 --> 45:34.427
Kingdom after they stopped me from going to 
Thailand to build those houses, I had them all

45:22.511 --> 45:34.427
under contract except the ones for the Navy up in 
Scotland before they moved me over to Germany. And

45:34.668 --> 45:41.256
then they went under contract with one of the 
entrepreneurs that I was dealing with. And when

45:41.276 --> 45:43.960
you start dealing with seven or eight different 
people to get 1,500 houses built in a foreign land

45:45.087 --> 45:55.460
and under their codes and everything. It's quite a 
challenge, so I was real pleased with that. I guess

45:59.165 --> 46:00.727
other people were, too. It wouldn't have paid off 
if it did.

46:11.561 --> 46:13.423
Those, of course, are peacetime things. back 
during the war well everything we accomplished i

46:14.332 --> 46:28.712
guess we felt good about it we always had to make do 
or there was always a shortage of some sort

46:42.597 --> 46:57.619
My biggest frustration, though, in my whole 
career

46:42.597 --> 46:57.619
was taking,

46:42.597 --> 46:57.619
making a major on 1 November 1944 and then not 
making a lieutenant colonel until
