WEBVTT

00:02.495 --> 00:09.003
We're

00:02.495 --> 00:09.003
at 2911 Georgia Street in North Carolina.

00:15.331 --> 00:17.014
And I'm getting ready to chat with Mr. W.S. 
Edmonds.

00:30.050 --> 00:30.130
W.S. Edmonds, E-D-M-O-N-D-A. All right. Say a 
sentence. By that, 1-2-3-4-1-2-3. Is my mic

00:31.652 --> 00:32.113
working well?

00:36.447 --> 00:40.062
This is now the second run. We're checking to see 
that this works.

09:30.710 --> 09:59.367
didn't get much out of it but then there was a ss 
market that i took a class under and i liked it and i

09:30.710 --> 09:59.367
did real well

09:30.710 --> 09:59.367
also one time i failed college algebra and then i 
took it in summer school and i made a flat 100.

09:30.710 --> 09:59.367
that was nice uh

10:02.789 --> 10:16.866
I had to wear the uniform and I had, if you were 
caught, you were put on the bull ring. I always

10:17.420 --> 10:25.869
thought that I only exceeded a certain amount I 
wouldn't have to work but maybe an hour. I went up

10:25.889 --> 10:34.899
there that day and Colonel Anderson said we don't 
keep books that way so I had to walk through the ring

10:25.889 --> 10:34.899
for four hours. Describe Colonel Andy. Well he was 
kind of a short fellow very athletic.

10:46.251 --> 10:46.752
I didn't care for that very much as a student, but I 
had to, oh, I do remember, I think it was Colonel

10:47.069 --> 11:04.769
Andy, that constantly, it seemed like every week, 
somebody would put a flag up on the flagpole, and

10:47.069 --> 11:04.769
he'd have to pay somebody to go up there and get that 
flag down. And that was quite an occasion. We'd all

11:06.751 --> 11:12.698
be around there, and I'm kind of kidding you, you 
know, I don't think he liked that. Now, he lived,

11:14.439 --> 11:16.722
Anderson's lived on campus? Yes, I'm sure he did. I 
don't even know what house. I knew quite a few of the

11:21.422 --> 11:23.986
homes that lived on there. Before I went to A&M, I 
used to deliver newspapers to all of them around

11:26.430 --> 11:31.358
here. Oh, which paper? The Eagle. I wrote the Inner 
Urban, the college where I lived there, at the

11:33.942 --> 11:40.713
North Cape. In Dubai, I picked up the paper. I was 
the only carrier in the Eagle. And as the police

11:45.642 --> 11:54.174
would go out, I would throw newspapers out along 
the trolley line. And they'd get the samples. I had

11:58.300 --> 12:01.966
about maybe 100 prescribers. They didn't count 
the papers on me or anything like that. And one of my

12:05.671 --> 12:11.059
favorite things is to go by the mess hall and take 
the papers in there, and they'd give you a good hand

12:05.671 --> 12:11.059
check. Do you remember what, what your pay was for 
that delivery? How much money did you make as a

12:16.434 --> 12:22.080
paper boy?

12:22.800 --> 12:26.644
And do you remember what the subscription was? How 
much did they pay for the paper?

12:36.655 --> 12:41.620
Did

12:36.655 --> 12:41.620
you have to collect the money? No, you just 
delivered.

12:50.563 --> 12:56.415
And you were the only Eagles delivery boy for the 
whole campus. I was kind of handed down from my

12:56.455 --> 13:00.442
family. My mother was a boy. And at one time, 
Linwood Boyette, who later became the elder of

13:04.027 --> 13:10.978
Texas University. And incidentally, they're the 
ones that gave the first steer to Texas

13:11.098 --> 13:14.363
University. Who was that now? Boyette? Linwood 
Boyette was the son of an uncle of mine, Doug A.

13:17.108 --> 13:21.655
Boyette. And as I understand, they gave the first 
steer to Texas University, the first vehicle.

13:31.010 --> 13:34.773
Now, he was a yell leader at Texas University. And 
then later, his brother became yell leader, Jack

13:34.794 --> 13:43.542
Boyette,

13:34.794 --> 13:43.542
at Texas University. He became yell leader, and 
Jack had held the legal route, and he turned it over

13:43.562 --> 13:50.228
to me. Now, Boyette's owned the property east of 
the campus theater, didn't they, at Northgate?

13:56.974 --> 13:59.076
They owned up through... Well, pharmacy, where 
Lupo's is now, Lipton Pharmacy on the other side of

14:00.878 --> 14:09.490
Spar. I remember Spar told my grandfather, he 
said, that's the best thing you ever did was get me

14:09.510 --> 14:23.990
to buy 10 feet, I believe, from back to set my 
building back. On downtown. When

14:26.866 --> 14:49.840
you were in high school, what businesses were 
there at Northgate?

14:50.020 --> 14:54.747
Uh...

14:57.899 --> 15:01.966
I don't remember too much about part of anything 
being there. As I understand, old Charlie's

15:02.326 --> 15:08.376
Grocery was there. That was later on. Might have 
been when I was in high school. And that building up

15:15.007 --> 15:18.252
there was a wooden building. At one time, I think my 
grandfather, somebody had a grocery store there.

15:26.266 --> 15:30.234
They had the gates when I was going there. They 
didn't lock the gates, but they had the gates

15:30.254 --> 15:44.340
around them and the door there with the fence. I 
remember one time my folks built a skating rink.

15:49.992 --> 16:01.468
Somehow or another, the university didn't care 
for them to go over there at night to the skating

15:49.992 --> 16:01.468
rink, so they just put the skating rink 
off-limits. And the kids couldn't come off the

16:03.571 --> 16:08.578
campus to go to the skating rink. A lot of them went 
to Brian's on the weekend for the picture show.

16:12.884 --> 16:13.585
They had a picture show in Brian's. There wasn't 
one in College Station. Not that I know of. What was

16:14.827 --> 16:17.651
there at Southgate? Were there any businesses 
over there yet? when

16:19.625 --> 16:46.442
you were in high school uh that's

16:19.625 --> 16:46.442
what i remember all they were

16:19.625 --> 16:46.442
was just over there in california and the campus 
faced the railroad

16:19.625 --> 16:46.442
well there was two railroads up there of course And 
they had the, incidentally, that's where they had

16:47.367 --> 16:55.139
these carts that they pulled stuff on. They were 
kind of four-wheel wagons, rather narrowly, with

16:55.159 --> 17:00.608
baggage carts. And that's what the Aggies used to 
haul stuff to the bond farm. As a matter of fact,

17:08.741 --> 17:10.824
they took our outhouse. We had an outhouse there. 
And...

17:16.915 --> 17:33.775
Well, I didn't object to that because you go up to 
the college

17:16.915 --> 17:33.775
and they didn't have any bulges. I think they took 
several outhouses around and that's

17:33.795 --> 17:39.022
it. Let's see, back to the campus. Do you remember 
how you registered? How did a student sign up

17:44.273 --> 17:49.621
for courses? Well, there wasn't really a problem 
at all. No, but did you stand, did you go to some

17:51.444 --> 17:56.231
thesis and stand in line? Oh, there was no line. The 
main thing was to get the money to register. Do you

18:02.902 --> 18:06.447
remember what it cost when you first entered A&M?

18:09.751 --> 18:17.123
Well, I remember my stepfather was working for the 
power plant at Collin.

18:18.705 --> 18:30.564
And he came home with his check, I suppose it was 
either a weekly check or a two-week check, and

18:18.705 --> 18:30.564
said, you take this money and go away.

18:30.584 --> 18:33.489
He said, I want you to go to Collin. Now, that 
couldn't have been very much for him. And

18:36.667 --> 18:56.695
you said you had to buy your own uniforms you did 
because you weren't physically Describe

18:36.667 --> 18:56.695
the uniform show or what?

18:59.960 --> 19:05.728
We

18:59.960 --> 19:05.728
had Well, of course, the seniors, I believe, had a 
little bit better hat with a stiff brim around it.

19:12.741 --> 19:19.969
And, of course, if you were in the artillery, you 
wore red and blue infantry and signal corps. All of

19:21.111 --> 19:30.921
that was on the hat that the seniors had with the 
gold braid coming out. How did you get introduced

19:32.877 --> 19:38.767
all of the Aggie traditions of whipping out and all 
that. How did a fish in those days get prepared?

19:50.967 --> 19:54.934
I

19:50.967 --> 19:54.934
was with the company. You were assigned, even 
though I had a hernia, I was just an ROTC and had good

19:54.954 --> 19:56.877
ROTC classes. And what outfit were you in?

20:04.177 --> 20:08.541
Which

20:04.177 --> 20:08.541
one? Did it have a nickname?

20:19.131 --> 20:26.458
But

20:19.131 --> 20:26.458
you had to go over and make formation in the 
afternoon? Where did y'all drill?

20:31.238 --> 20:36.186
You were just in front of the dormitory. I had to go 
there and be available when they called the kids to

20:37.688 --> 20:50.809
be with the first one to the room to run an errand for 
the upper class. And the one thing I liked about it

20:50.829 --> 20:53.593
when you would go to, I believe you got, when you 
used the board, let's say, sophomores were

20:54.468 --> 21:22.973
usually kind of bad they were the roughest but if 
they got too rough then the juniors would come

20:54.468 --> 21:22.973
along and that that would slow it down so there was a 
control there uh really and there were one or

20:54.468 --> 21:22.973
two arguments that couldn't take it at all Do

21:24.944 --> 21:31.958
you remember what kind of paddle did they use? What 
size was it? What was it made out of?

21:48.198 --> 21:55.188
kind of did a little artwork on their paddles, and 
they had specific paddles. We always enjoyed the

21:56.149 --> 22:09.969
day when they got where it was called, but it was the

21:56.149 --> 22:09.969
day that the underclassmen would paddle the upper 
class. Was that fish day?

22:14.435 --> 22:14.735
Fish day, yeah. Did you paddle somebody? So even

22:17.003 --> 22:34.333
though you didn't eat on campus, you were expected 
to do chores, run errands for upperclassmen. And

22:34.353 --> 22:37.358
how long at night would you have to do that? I think 
it was up to

22:39.751 --> 22:50.345
about 7 o'clock. After that, some nights,

22:50.366 --> 23:03.864
it was just during the afternoon, the time they 
went to jail,

22:50.366 --> 23:03.864
really. But I did miss out on sometimes, what you 
call it, an air outing, where they put you in the

23:03.884 --> 23:08.290
paddock and they make the guys leave you gone, you 
know. Did you... So you would get up and go to your 8

23:12.320 --> 23:15.664
o'clock class. You didn't have to go over and stand 
inspection before breakfast.

23:25.935 --> 23:27.557
Oh, you did? Okay. And then you'd go to class. 
Describe a full day of classes. What did you do all

23:33.663 --> 23:35.205
day?

23:40.248 --> 23:52.641
Well, it seemed like the classes just ran from more 
or less 8 o'clock until noon, and then 1 o'clock to

23:40.248 --> 23:52.641
5. I think the longest class was probably,

23:52.661 --> 24:05.796
I took it to agriculture, that was generally, that 
was actually pretty well free from 5 o'clock. What

24:06.636 --> 24:09.139
was your major, do you remember? Well, I 
thought... I started mechanical engineering and

24:10.454 --> 24:28.672
I dropped mechanical engineering and ended up 
with agriculture administration and also I took

24:10.454 --> 24:28.672
cotton marketing classes which I really enjoyed. 
I ended up later when I left A&M going into cotton in

24:28.692 --> 24:37.541
New Orleans. I really enjoyed that. Now when you 
were in class, did you attend regularly? Did you go

24:43.004 --> 24:50.274
to class regularly, regularly, and they checked 
the role?

24:53.960 --> 25:06.178
Did

24:53.960 --> 25:06.178
you all ever do any mischief in class? Oh, no.

25:10.857 --> 25:14.880
Not at that time. Not at all. What about going to 
sleep in class? No, you didn't do that either. I did

25:21.807 --> 25:28.673
that when I was in OCS at Fort Chill. I stood in the 
corner for four hours. During the day, If you

25:37.225 --> 25:48.442
wanted to get a Coca Cola, or to just take a break, 
where did y'all go during the day cases? I had the

25:48.582 --> 25:56.273
money I got a banana split. I think it might have 
been about was that in the YMCA? That is downstairs

26:03.324 --> 26:05.708
in the YMCA. They also had Do you

26:07.600 --> 26:33.148
remember

26:07.600 --> 26:33.148
getting your fish haircut? No not really. I do, it 
comes about, I do remember there was one comrade

26:36.946 --> 26:53.166
down there that joined the Brines, and it was a man 
in Brines that had received a hot check. And so, he

26:53.186 --> 27:05.000
got all the, about 10 or 12 of us, I didn't know it 
until later, and interviewed us, and that man

26:53.186 --> 27:05.000
couldn't pick out who had did it. I was completely 
innocent because I had gone in the store and

27:07.355 --> 27:15.265
I had gone in there. But I was one of about 10 or 12. 
And he kept man didn't know who really did it. He

27:25.138 --> 27:26.079
thinks like that. And I do remember the common 
dance As a

27:28.955 --> 27:45.858
student, what were the things that you all knew 
were totally prohibited? You might do pranks or

27:46.319 --> 27:50.965
play jokes, but there must have been some limit. 
What were the things that were off limits?

27:58.992 --> 28:04.998
The main thing was getting out of the uniform, as I 
remember, and getting put on the bull ring. Now,

28:06.199 --> 28:09.002
where was the bull ring then? When you walked the 
bull ring, where was that? Well, it was either in

28:11.765 --> 28:17.150
the drill field or you'd walk to what's called a 
fish tank. I believe it was a fish tank.

28:22.376 --> 28:27.801
I remember one thing that a friend of mine that I 
knew fairly well He was living in the dormitory and

28:28.726 --> 28:40.040
he had gotten some whiskey

28:28.726 --> 28:40.040
and he was selling it for the dancers. He'd pour up 
little bottles and made a little money one week and

28:41.862 --> 28:49.952
did it again. About the second time though he did 
it, the I've forgotten the communist name, but he

28:55.372 --> 28:58.436
called him in. Colonel Andy? Huh? Was it Colonel 
Andy? No, it wasn't Colonel Andy. Somebody, oh,

29:02.742 --> 29:05.346
okay. He called him in and said, now, I know what 
you're doing. We haven't had any trouble, but I

29:10.373 --> 29:13.257
don't want you to do that anymore.

29:16.822 --> 29:18.304
Well, that was the end of that. He didn't kick him 
out of school or anything like that, but he called

29:18.324 --> 29:23.792
him in and said, now, don't do that anymore in terms 
of alcohol

29:25.544 --> 29:51.855
where where could a student have bought beer when 
you were an undergraduate

29:25.544 --> 29:51.855
there's very few places if I know all there were a 
few pieces that have people that bootlegged

29:25.544 --> 29:51.855
whiskey you could get bootleg whiskey fairly easy 
over around Brenham in Washington County. But you

29:57.796 --> 29:59.618
had to leave Brazos County to get it. Pretty well. 
There were some people that handled, that

30:00.478 --> 30:04.642
bootlegged here in Brazos County.

30:07.605 --> 30:15.012
But

30:07.605 --> 30:15.012
there wasn't that much drinking, you would say, 
back in those days. There really wasn't. Now, when

30:16.553 --> 30:21.117
I got here, people drove to Whiskey Bridge. 
towards Snook and bought whiskey just across the

30:22.143 --> 30:25.968
river. Did that exist then, that place? No, the 
only thing they had was some bootleg whiskey and

30:28.451 --> 30:42.871
that was, or there might have been maybe a couple of 
places out in Brazos County where if you knew

30:28.451 --> 30:42.871
somebody you could go in there and get a little bit.

30:44.773 --> 30:46.716
And in Washington County, What, what about beer? 
Where could you buy beer? No, because you had to

30:54.955 --> 31:03.745
roll your own for one day. And I don't remember

31:03.865 --> 31:16.720
anybody

31:03.865 --> 31:16.720
ever

31:03.865 --> 31:16.720
spoke. Both of them didn't have enough money.
