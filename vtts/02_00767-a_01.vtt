00:01.195 --> 00:21.461
Mr. Wiesen, first of all, would you tell us 
something about your early life, including the

00:01.195 --> 00:21.461
names of your parents, the dates of their birth and 
death, the places where they were born, the place

00:01.195 --> 00:21.461
where you were born, and the time of your birth, the 
schools you attended before you went to A&M? I was

00:21.481 --> 00:24.604
born in Fort Worth in 1892. My parents were married 
in 1890-some time. Ninety, I believe it was. And my

00:33.337 --> 00:42.449
father had been born in Berlin, and he came to this 
country, to Houston, Texas, when he was seven

00:33.337 --> 00:42.449
years old. And the family moved to Baird, Texas. At 
that time, the Texas Pacific was moving west, and

00:47.555 --> 00:54.104
it established a terminal at Baird, Texas. And my 
grandfather, who was a professional engraver,

00:54.324 --> 00:58.890
moved there. Of course, a watchmaker and And 
Graver was kind of a lost affair in a cowboy town,

01:01.135 --> 01:08.182
but the kids, the children grew up there. My father 
and his brother and three sisters. And that was

01:10.884 --> 01:11.665
Baird? Baird, Texas. How was that spelled? 
B-A-I-R-D in Callahan County. It's about fifteen

01:16.450 --> 01:19.953
miles east of Appalachia. And they lived there. He 
built the first rock house in the country, and they

01:22.215 --> 01:30.163
lived there until all the children were grown and 
married. And my father, of course, unable to go to

01:31.308 --> 01:57.602
school, he became a printer's devil, and that's 
where he learned the English language so that he

01:31.308 --> 01:57.602
could, later years, as a locomotive engineer and 
chairman for the Brotherhood of Locomotive

01:31.308 --> 01:57.602
Engineers, he became, stayed in that position for 
some 30 years and died in 1920, 1920.

01:59.573 --> 02:02.276
I've forgotten, 59 I believe. No, it's 49. And my 
mother lived on until 56.

02:14.969 --> 02:16.630
Was your mother born in the United States? She was 
born in East Texas, in Raines County, Texas, and

02:16.650 --> 02:27.201
the family had come there from Tennessee.

02:27.721 --> 02:31.587
grain and water mill on the Sabine River back 
before the Civil War. That was your mother's

02:32.488 --> 02:33.710
father? Yeah, my mother's father. There was a very 
large family, and a good many of them passed on. But

02:41.181 --> 02:46.208
I was reared in Fort Worth itself, and I went to 
school there. I was in high school from 1907 to

02:47.510 --> 02:55.602
1911.

02:56.628 --> 02:58.991
From there I went to work for a railroad company. 
Which railroad? Texas Pacific Railroad Company

03:00.172 --> 03:08.823
in the baggage and ticket department, and 
enlisted and enrolled in the business college.

03:10.105 --> 03:11.086
This was in Fort Worth? Fort Worth Brantley Drone 
Business College. And for the next two years I was

03:14.030 --> 03:23.462
very active in that, and I had decided after three 
years of working for the railroad company, which

03:24.472 --> 03:33.125
my father opposed very much, that I better think 
about going to college. And I had a number of

03:34.588 --> 03:49.230
friends who had gone to A&M, and my father told me 
that if I would go to A&M and study agriculture, I

03:34.588 --> 03:49.230
could have the farm, which we had between Fort 
Worth and Dallas. But that didn't weigh heavily in

03:50.628 --> 03:57.056
my decision, I just, because I knew so many people 
had gone to A&M. I went to A&M at night, fall of 15,

03:57.837 --> 04:14.038
and

03:57.837 --> 04:14.038
everything was fine the freshman, sophomore 
year, and the junior year, of course, the war came,

03:57.837 --> 04:14.038
had already been in progress since 1914. And when 
we got into it, I was eligible for the Leon Springs

04:21.256 --> 04:34.051
training camp, but the doctor, what was his name, I 
can't remember, he talked me out of it, and so they

04:21.256 --> 04:34.051
wanted me to finish my course at college. But it was 
very soon after the group of us got excited, and 57

04:35.032 --> 04:50.790
of us went over to a pep meeting given by some Army 
recruiting officer, and before we knew what

04:35.032 --> 04:50.790
happened to us, we'd all enlisted in the Air Force. 
First

04:52.019 --> 05:02.176
of all, let me ask a question before you go on. Did 
you have to go through any special procedures to

05:02.837 --> 05:06.523
enter Texas A&M? No. I wrote down there, and they 
told me to come on down, and when I came in, old

05:08.647 --> 05:18.583
Reynolds met me at the station at 4 o'clock in the 
morning and took me up. Foster Hall and then took me

05:19.475 --> 05:24.202
over that morning to the registrar's office. Who 
was it that met you? I think his name was Reynolds. I

05:29.270 --> 05:31.974
can always remember him, but I don't remember his 
initials. But he was in D Company, and so that's how

05:32.015 --> 05:37.483
I landed in D Company and Foster Hall. He was down 
there looking for recruits for Foster Hall. I see.

05:45.361 --> 05:49.526
By going into Foster Hall, then, you ended up being 
in B Company. Yes.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.433
Did you have to send a transcript of your high 
school grades? I brought that with me. Did you

05:57.855 --> 06:02.561
receive any credit for the business courses that 
you had taken? In fact, I had two deficiencies. I

06:05.764 --> 06:10.710
dropped out the last two months of my senior year 
because I had misunderstanding with my math

06:11.045 --> 06:17.712
teacher, who I'd been known all my life, and I felt 
that she and the principal let me down. So I left

06:19.134 --> 06:22.658
school without finishing, so I had to make up those 
credits. And I had a deficiency in math, which I

06:23.699 --> 06:28.144
made up first year. Made a 99 in it more than I ever 
made before. I remember that. What were your first

06:34.050 --> 06:40.157
reactions to A&M and to College Station when you 
arrived Well, you see, A&M was out in the country

06:41.993 --> 06:48.040
those days, and we served by two railroads only. 
And it was isolated. And I, being four years older

06:51.064 --> 07:01.076
than the average freshman,

06:51.064 --> 07:01.076
I was a little bit more mature looking back on it. 
And I felt some restraints about being confined to

07:01.096 --> 07:07.844
the campus, which was very strict in those days. 
And, of course, I brought up at home to be

07:10.951 --> 07:31.619
disciplined at home all my life, and I was very 
strict about observing the restrictions, the

07:10.951 --> 07:31.619
regulations, and to go into town on Saturday, of 
course, you had to go on the trolley car, and there

07:10.951 --> 07:31.619
was nothing after you got there. So I was a little 
bit uncomfortable, but the fact that there seemed

07:32.781 --> 07:39.810
so much to do without any supervision or 
responsibility was a period of freedom to me. I

07:51.442 --> 08:06.044
enjoyed the, I was told before I went there I 
wouldn't like the military, but the military

07:51.442 --> 08:06.044
didn't bother me until later in the year when the 
question of hazing came up. And we had a good many

08:06.064 --> 08:09.409
diehards in the upper classes on his hazing 
question, and there was considerable hazing went

08:10.132 --> 08:18.243
on. Sub Rosen. Well, the first I knew about it, one 
of the seniors came out and asked me what I thought

08:20.907 --> 08:35.346
about Bissell's speech on hazing, and I told him I 
agreed with it in that put me on the blacklist in

08:35.967 --> 08:39.831
that group for the rest of the year. I'm pretty 
sure, looking back on it, because I was, I didn't

08:39.891 --> 08:46.619
get run and hazed very much. I was abused by one or 
two people, and the only person I ever hated in my

08:47.340 --> 09:01.415
life was the sophomore who cleared through the 
school, was one of the person who was very brutal to

08:47.340 --> 09:01.415
me. And I intended to kill him one time. I decided I 
was going to do that, but I got control of my senses

09:06.511 --> 09:18.608
enough to realize that these things were passing, 
and so nothing came of it. But my sophomore year, I

09:20.871 --> 09:28.502
think, was my happiest year there.

09:30.828 --> 09:36.994
I had, of course, many friends, and it was very 
pleasant. Like some of the most more pleasant

09:37.614 --> 09:43.820
reflections I've had in a lot of years has been in 
that period of time. And then when the

09:45.041 --> 10:00.835
time came to decide about going into the Army,

09:45.041 --> 10:00.835
this group of us that went in were thrown together 
in one area. And that year, of course, was one of the

10:01.642 --> 10:12.476
very severe winters, and we had lots of sickness, 
and the flu epidemic broke out. This was the flu

10:13.457 --> 10:15.500
epidemic on campus? Yes. They had some temporary 
buildings built around. I couldn't locate them

10:19.585 --> 10:23.170
now. I know where they were, but we had an influx of 
people from all over the north and east into this

10:23.190 --> 10:30.940
service company. And our hospital was a new 
building, but it was not intended for such large

10:31.443 --> 10:42.697
numbers, and they couldn't accommodate all the 
people who were ill.

10:47.964 --> 10:56.775
I was confined to Ross Hall, third floor, and I got 
the flu just right out of the blue.

10:57.700 --> 11:04.510
I never went to hospital, and never saw the doctor, 
and after three or four weeks, I couldn't get out of

10:57.700 --> 11:04.510
bed. And some women on the campus in the Home 
Economics Department inquired about me, and they

11:05.752 --> 11:13.724
told it. They didn't even miss me out of the office, 
apparently, it was so much confusion. I was

11:17.791 --> 11:19.353
assistant to the adjutant. And these two women 
either paid or bribed or did, arranged with these

11:26.978 --> 11:31.603
soldiers to get a litter and bring me down to their 
house on the campus. And they set me up on this cot in

11:32.644 --> 11:37.108
their living room, and they started to work on me. 
If they hadn't, I wouldn't have lived, because

11:37.689 --> 11:41.953
they were dying all around there, you know. And 
those two people were Marty Higgins in the Home

11:43.274 --> 11:53.965
Economics Department, not the State Home 
Demonstration Agent, pardon me, And Laura Neal

11:54.755 --> 11:56.938
was in charge. And they were the two people that 
Laura Neal had been, that was a teacher in Fort

11:58.260 --> 12:06.131
Worth High School when I was a student there. 
That's the reason I knew her, came to know her. And

12:10.237 --> 12:19.771
Marty Higgins always said later that I was her fish 
because I always kept the house in repair on the

12:10.237 --> 12:19.771
campus. Well, this was sort of an appreciation for 
taking care of you while you were sick, I think.

12:25.062 --> 12:25.603
Indeed. In fact, we were in contact all the years 
later. She died at the age of 83, four years ago, in

12:31.789 --> 12:36.413
Arlington. She had, while I was in China, she 
married E.E. Davis, who was the first dean of the

12:42.119 --> 12:48.165
Arlington School, and they lived in Arlington. 
But I'm getting ahead of myself in a way because on

12:48.185 --> 12:55.052
graduation, We had no replacement service at that 
time, and it was always a headache for those

12:56.855 --> 13:11.697
graduating what they were going to do, those whose 
parents hadn't already provided a place for them.

13:11.717 --> 13:22.373
And so I made the expression to the local Episcopal 
minister that I would like to go as far away so far

13:23.163 --> 13:28.288
away from A&M to take $49 to send a postal card home. 
And of course they laughed about that, and I have

13:28.929 --> 13:31.932
since. And so the next day or two, he told me that 
they wanted somebody to teach school in Japan.

13:39.960 --> 13:43.003
Well, I said, you know, I'm not fit for a teacher. I 
don't have enough equipment for a teacher. Well,

13:46.586 --> 13:53.153
he said the type of school they have there, you 
would probably wouldn't find too much

13:46.586 --> 13:53.153
difficulty. If you want, I'll write to the board in 
New York and give them your name," and he did. But in

14:00.709 --> 14:16.644
the meantime, I was given recommendations to 
various organizations, particularly in Dallas,

14:00.709 --> 14:16.644
and I went up to Plyford Shops, and I was told that I 
was, had good training, but I'd had no experience.

14:16.664 --> 14:17.625
They couldn't use me. I communicated this to Dean 
Kyle, who was, I relied on for most of my

14:23.761 --> 14:29.670
information anyhow and advice. And he told me to 
get on a train and go out to Fort Stockton and to take

14:30.631 --> 14:42.949
over a job of measuring water for one of the two 
first irrigation projects out there. So it took an

14:42.970 --> 14:52.063
almost three-day trip by train I got to Fort 
Stockton and was taken out on the reservation

14:42.970 --> 14:52.063
there. I stayed there until the following spring, 
when most of the work was done. In the meantime, I

14:59.214 --> 15:08.788
was in contact with this fiscal board of missions, 
and they wanted me to go to China. They, of course,

15:08.828 --> 15:13.956
laid out the plans, and I accepted that. But I had to 
wait for the summer, so I took a job with the Cisco

15:14.596 --> 15:20.565
Chamber of Commerce. on the way home back to Fort 
Worth and stayed there for four or five months with

15:21.187 --> 15:35.367
working with them on a drive to raise the bond 
issue, money for a bond issue to build a dam, which

15:21.187 --> 15:35.367
was done after I left. So I got myself together and 
went to China. I left on August 18th from Vancouver

15:41.596 --> 15:47.785
in 1920. And six weeks later, I was in Shanghai, and 
I stayed with the mission school for the next two

15:48.659 --> 16:11.370
years, and

15:48.659 --> 16:11.370
decided that I needed to come home because I was 
only getting $70 a month, and I couldn't pay my

15:48.659 --> 16:11.370
taxes back home. So I was telling my troubles to Dr. 
Washoe, who later became famous in the Roosevelt

16:17.195 --> 16:25.146
administration for saving an American crew over 
in Java. Dr. Waslow advised me to take the job in

16:26.248 --> 16:31.836
Hankow instead of going home. Hankow was an 
international city across the river from

16:32.236 --> 16:41.810
Wuchang, the capital of Hubei province in China.

16:41.830 --> 16:45.295
So I interviewed manager of this dollar-a-rubber 
dollar company. They had a big lumber yard and a big

16:50.249 --> 16:59.203
warehouse of railroad and firefighting 
equipment and things of that kind. It was an import

16:59.223 --> 17:00.225
house. And they sent me to Shanghai on the first 
trip to one of the most palatial river steamers

17:01.206 --> 17:09.499
that ever operated on the river. Of course, a 
country boy from America, I was very much

17:10.380 --> 17:15.248
impressed with all of this. So after a week of 
training in the Shanghai office, they sent me back

17:16.628 --> 17:38.797
to Hancao, and the managers, a year later, decided 
to retire and come home, and left me there, but they

17:16.628 --> 17:38.797
sent people from other parts of the world in there 
to operate the district manager over me. And we

17:40.159 --> 17:42.602
sold lumber. operated river steamers on the upper 
river, which was to me a very romantic operation,

17:43.460 --> 17:56.935
both profitable and dangerous, and exciting in 
other words. But there I learned, put into

17:58.597 --> 18:06.025
practice all my knowledge of accounting, and I of 
course, had to be active in the foreign community,

18:07.962 --> 18:22.298
which was predominantly British, but had 
Russians and not very many Germans at that time,

18:07.962 --> 18:22.298
but Japanese who were not socially acceptable in 
those days. But we had a very pleasant colonial

18:23.299 --> 18:37.935
atmosphere under extraterritorial religion,

18:23.299 --> 18:37.935
and

18:23.299 --> 18:37.935
life was the kind of life that a person might want to 
live today in retirement if they had the money to

18:39.113 --> 18:51.084
live like we lived there, because without much 
money we had very many luxuries. Of course, plenty

18:52.365 --> 18:55.528
of servants and not much expense. And that lasted 
for until the company reorganized around the

18:56.669 --> 19:07.078
World Service and gave preference to California 
people. rather than people from other parts of the

19:07.261 --> 19:26.582
country, and my dissatisfaction was expressed to 
a close associate in another company, a firm that

19:07.261 --> 19:26.582
had been in China for a hundred years, a private 
firm, exporters of tung oil oil, or Chinese wood

19:07.261 --> 19:26.582
oil. And they wanted me to come over there, and so I 
arranged with the company in Shanghai after they

19:26.602 --> 19:37.234
decided they were not going to give me a promotion 
of any kind. And I went back upriver to Gillespie

19:37.973 --> 19:47.186
and Sons and became assistant manager there for 
the next four years. We had operated the

19:47.206 --> 20:07.255
distributorship for the Ford Motor Company, and I 
was in charge of that program, which meant that I

19:47.206 --> 20:07.255
had to get out in the country to get towns to 
cooperate to build roads between towns and then

19:47.206 --> 20:07.255
sell them. cars and build the bodies, truck 
bodies, I mean passenger bodies to go on, because

20:08.045 --> 20:22.103
commercial trucks were not quite out of the 
question at that time because it was cheap labor,

20:08.045 --> 20:22.103
but people wanted to ride. So Pepper laid out these 
agencies and got the roads built, and then we sold,

20:22.443 --> 20:34.558
built the cars and sold the cars, and this program 
went on for When I left in 27, when the Ford Motor

20:36.007 --> 20:44.936
Company went out of production, we had 50,000 
miles of roads. And the last project was the first

20:46.357 --> 20:50.861
cars in Sichuan province. That's the Sichuan 
province beyond the mountains in western China,

20:50.941 --> 21:00.871
next to Tibet. And after many excursions in there 
afoot, finally pinned down. The missionaries had

21:09.029 --> 21:13.155
built very beautiful city streets for China. 
There was 400 missionaries in that area of all

21:14.477 --> 21:30.381
denominations, and they had cooperated in the 
opposition to the home boards in buying land

21:14.477 --> 21:30.381
around a given area and establishing a university 
in the center which was owned by all of them, but

21:30.749 --> 21:37.475
administered by a special group representative 
of these groups. And the West China Union

21:37.495 --> 21:43.080
University was an outstanding institution. And 
they had provided the incentive for people to be

21:43.100 --> 21:51.187
more forward looking. And for that reason, I was 
able to sell them on a program of cars. And I put the

21:57.032 --> 21:59.254
first cars in. 18 months to deliver it all. Some of 
them had to be, packages had to be broken down in

22:04.828 --> 22:14.138
100-pound packages and carried over the 
mountains on man's back and put back together

22:04.828 --> 22:14.138
again. But that was the last program we had in 
China, and the Communist Revolution came in at

22:15.199 --> 22:21.506
that time. It actually came in in 25, and it reached 
central China by 27. who forced out practically

22:29.508 --> 22:37.876
all the missionaries from the Orient, and most 
businesses were curtailed.

22:38.997 --> 22:44.182
I came home on leave at that time after four years. 
This would have been on leave from Gillespie. Yes.

22:47.845 --> 22:57.034
That was a practice in the Orient to send you home 
for six months, expenses paid after every four

22:47.845 --> 22:57.034
years. I think that originally originated in 
India, where the climate was so severe that it

22:57.706 --> 23:13.922
affected the physical capacity of people to stay 
in that hot climate so many—a long period. But in

23:14.482 --> 23:27.375
it, the British customs rather prevailed 
throughout the Orient in those days, and so that's

23:14.482 --> 23:27.375
one of the things that all companies did, all 
foreign companies did. They had families that

23:28.182 --> 23:35.752
sent the whole work home for six months vacation on 
full pay, and then come back. But while I was home,

23:36.633 --> 23:39.657
the things broke loose there. The company lost $5 
billion on the breaking of the market for shellac

23:39.677 --> 23:46.065
in India. My firm was, had been in from the 
beginning. The importation of shellac was very

23:49.930 --> 23:56.198
important in the, in the record business. at that 
time, and radio began to come in, and the record

23:57.308 --> 24:25.358
business went on the skids, and the shellac market 
broke, and that had some effect on the firm, and

23:57.308 --> 24:25.358
then the speculation in wood oil, which had been 
interrupted by the Communist Revolution in 25,

23:57.308 --> 24:25.358
27, 28, and so they sold out Spencer Kellogg and 
left one man in charge out there to wind up. So I was

24:25.928 --> 24:27.450
out of a job yet. Could we stop at this point of your 
career and kind of back up a little bit to your days

24:29.072 --> 24:35.019
on campus? I did get away from that, didn't I? Okay. 
I'm sorry. You should have stopped me. Well, I was

24:41.927 --> 24:47.394
interested in your story about going to China and 
your activities there. You said that your train

24:48.575 --> 24:55.243
arrived in College Station at like four o'clock in 
the morning and it was a representative from Ross

24:48.575 --> 24:55.243
Hall. Was this a common practice? From Foster 
Hall. Foster Hall, I'm sorry. I think it was. It was

25:00.675 --> 25:01.516
a common practice. I did practice it myself in 
later years, but I noticed that Foster Hall was one

25:01.536 --> 25:15.779
of the older halls, you see, and Mitchell Hall and 
two others were modern, had steam heat. Foster

25:16.461 --> 25:22.050
Hall, Ross Hall, and the band hall, what was that 
name in Austin Hall? Mm-hmm. were the first

25:22.477 --> 25:29.349
buildings on the campus, and they had wood stoves 
and wash pans and a washstand. You had to go

25:29.369 --> 25:31.693
downstairs to get your water and bring it up. You 
had to go out and bring your wood up. And that was one

25:33.716 --> 25:40.849
of the real activities of all the freshmen, is to 
keep the wood boxes full on all those four floors.

25:41.610 --> 25:46.999
And so naturally, the other dormitories didn't 
have to work. People didn't have to everybody

25:48.228 --> 25:51.652
wanted to get in the more modern places. And all 
those country boys, so-called, we got over in

25:51.672 --> 25:56.298
Foster Hall. You were recruited for Foster Hall 
then, or one of the other ones, by one of the

25:56.679 --> 26:02.767
upperclassmen, I take it. Yeah. I think of his name 
one of these days. I mean, I can't call it, I see him,

26:05.610 --> 26:11.518
I can visualize him. So it was a practice primarily 
then of the older dormitories to be at the train

26:14.097 --> 26:27.018
station and recruit their freshmen so they'd have 
somebody to fill the wood box and carry the water

26:14.097 --> 26:27.018
for them. That was the assumption. Now I don't know 
whether that was actually true or not. Would you

26:33.909 --> 26:36.814
describe a typical day? when you were in school. I 
would like for you to include the time of getting up

26:40.115 --> 26:52.771
and the procedure of getting up and what you did 
then and as far as going to meals and the time you

26:40.115 --> 26:52.771
spent in class and what you did otherwise. Well, of 
course, you know, we wore blue shirts, blue shirts

26:52.811 --> 27:02.703
with a blue uniform, a gray uniform, I guess you'd 
call it gray, had a bow tie. Most of us never had a bow

27:02.743 --> 27:07.088
tie before and it was a learning tie, but Reveille, 
you were out of bed, and you had to get down, and you

27:07.979 --> 27:13.127
had to have that bow tie on. Some of the 
upperclassmen would go down there and weren't

27:13.147 --> 27:17.513
dressed that way, but got away with it. But we 
freshmen, we had to have that bow tie. I learned to

27:21.118 --> 27:23.602
tie a bow tie running downstairs. How much time did 
you have between Reveille and the time you had to be

27:25.044 --> 27:28.529
there? I don't recall, but I think it was five 
minutes. It may have been ten, but I doubt it. I

27:34.439 --> 27:36.583
think it seemed like it was five minutes. So you had 
to get out of bed and get dressed and be down there.

27:38.867 --> 27:40.169
Get down there, yes. But it may have been ten 
minutes, but as I recall, I think it was five

27:40.189 --> 27:44.457
minutes. We were always in line. I was always in 
line when the vehicle sounded.

27:54.013 --> 27:57.780
We had setting up exercises, too. This was right 
after you got down in the line? Yeah, we got down in

27:59.745 --> 28:00.847
the line. We were all accounted for. Then we had 
setting up exercises and dismissed and went back

28:01.868 --> 28:08.076
to clean our rooms and got the next call for 
breakfast. And then we had formation and marched

28:08.096 --> 28:12.802
to the hall for breakfast. And then when we came 
back, we were supposed to have an inspection. I

28:16.327 --> 28:19.451
forgot at what time, before we went to class. And 
they had an inspection of the room. Everything had

28:21.013 --> 28:24.257
to be cleaned. Not the regular inspection—Sunday 
mornings we had a regular inspection by the

28:24.727 --> 28:35.921
incumbent, but

28:24.727 --> 28:35.921
whoever was on daily duty—what do we call that? At 
daily duty, somebody came and inspected the room.

28:40.067 --> 28:42.550
See, the bed was made up— Wouldn't that have been 
the officer of the day? Officer of the day, what I'm

28:42.770 --> 28:45.774
trying to say. Gee, I'll remember that, officer of 
the day. And then we went to classes. And of course,

28:52.705 --> 28:54.487
we had different schedules. Some had, most of us 
had an eight o'clock class. But the class schedule

28:58.131 --> 29:01.354
followed until four o'clock. And then we had 
drill.

29:06.760 --> 29:11.185
And that was pretty regular, five days a week, 
except on Friday was a dress parade. And that was,

29:12.966 --> 29:19.253
in the wintertime, of course, it was They didn't 
have the setting up exercises when it was severe

29:19.705 --> 29:29.295
weather, but that was the ordinary run of things of 
the day. Three times the mess hall. After the mess

29:32.478 --> 29:46.793
hall, for the first week, of course, we had to go to 
the chapel for instructions and various

29:32.478 --> 29:46.793
organizations announcing their programs and 
things of that kind. But there wasn't much

29:47.313 --> 29:50.776
argument in the way of private argument. There was 
no secret organization. It literally formed the

29:53.739 --> 30:01.366
clubs, the Fort Worth Club, the Lamb County Club, 
people from that group. And they had meetings in

30:01.386 --> 30:17.100
the dormitory room between—it was usually in the 
evening between seven thirty and ten when taps

30:01.386 --> 30:17.100
sounded.

30:18.346 --> 30:26.154
I don't know of any other activity except in the 
fall when the football game—we were all out for

30:18.346 --> 30:26.154
that. And later, as basketball developed, we went 
to basketball games on the campus. There wasn't

30:31.379 --> 30:33.221
anything off the campus. It was confined to the 
campus. Were there any facilities in the Y, say,

30:36.764 --> 30:40.468
for YMCA? The YMCA had a swimming pool, which was 
not there the first year. But it was the second, and

30:46.915 --> 30:52.372
I never did get in that pool. They had Sunday school 
classes after chapel in the YMCA.
