WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:05.985
Go down there and drink, and drink, and drink, and drink.

00:06.606 --> 00:07.567
You couldn't eat anything.

00:08.829 --> 00:10.932
You were 10% dehydrated every day.

00:12.775 --> 00:14.417
And your body won't take on food.

00:14.478 --> 00:17.302
It is screaming for rehydration.

00:18.924 --> 00:21.408
And it was always that way with his practices.

00:22.049 --> 00:30.882
With Coach George,

00:33.663 --> 00:38.207
A typical practice lasted about what?

00:40.990 --> 00:45.334
I would say an hour and a half, rarely two hours.

00:45.695 --> 00:48.938
Was it well planned in terms of what happened, how long?

00:51.801 --> 00:55.364
Nothing like Coach Bryant.

00:55.745 --> 01:00.109
Coach Bryant was regimented like a military unit.

01:00.798 --> 01:04.802
the whistle blew and you moved to the next drill and et cetera.

01:04.982 --> 01:12.891
With Ray George, it was more relaxed and if he wanted to do something for a while with you, he didn't pay that much attention to the schedule.

01:14.492 --> 01:19.097
Coach George was what I would describe as laid back, easy going.

01:21.360 --> 01:28.307
Were there some rules, either spoken or unspoken, that you all realized were real rules with Coach George?

01:30.835 --> 01:33.198
Oh, absolutely.

01:34.319 --> 01:39.786
But they were the rules of life that we all followed then.

01:40.968 --> 01:48.217
We didn't drink and we didn't stay out late and we didn't break the rules and we did what we were told and never questioned it.

01:48.618 --> 01:51.161
Were there some folks that smoked on the team?

01:52.202 --> 01:55.807
Yes, but they didn't do it during the season.

01:56.288 --> 01:57.349
As a general rule,

01:57.616 --> 02:07.145
The smoking that was done would be done on the weekend maybe when they were playing hearts or pinochle or something like that.

02:07.205 --> 02:08.726
That's where the smoking took place.

02:09.547 --> 02:13.831
You never wanted the coach, you never allowed the coach to see you smoking.

02:14.151 --> 02:18.235
Now, that first semester you were in Hart, then where did you live?

02:19.155 --> 02:23.279
I moved to the Corps and lived in the Corps for one year and I'm proud that I spent a year in the Corps.

02:23.299 --> 02:23.860
What outfit?

02:24.340 --> 02:24.921
A-Signal.

02:25.381 --> 02:26.442
Did it have a nickname?

02:29.020 --> 02:30.481
Or if it did, I don't remember.

02:30.642 --> 02:31.602
Did you have a nickname?

02:32.343 --> 02:34.105
Did your buddies give you a nickname?

02:34.125 --> 02:34.645
Just Charlie.

02:34.846 --> 02:35.366
Just Charlie?

02:35.586 --> 02:35.826
Yes.

02:36.667 --> 02:40.110
And your major then became what?

02:40.130 --> 02:41.732
Animal husbandry, still.

02:42.012 --> 02:42.453
Why that?

02:42.913 --> 02:43.153
Why?

02:44.014 --> 02:47.658
It was agriculture and I wanted to be a farmer rancher.

02:49.219 --> 02:52.222
I didn't worry about how I was going to be a farmer rancher.

02:52.382 --> 02:54.484
I wanted to be a farmer and rancher.

02:55.325 --> 02:57.627
And I was bound and determined to get my degree

02:58.332 --> 03:02.097
but the best place in the United States to be one, in College Station.

03:04.399 --> 03:09.425
Lee Phillips, whom you know well, was the first sergeant that year when I moved over there.

03:10.186 --> 03:13.490
Bless his heart, I hate to see Lee's health feeling like it is right now.

03:14.351 --> 03:26.126
He was over at all the ceremonies with the Reveille here a week ago, and my goodness, he's walking with a cane at times, and you know, he's got some heart problems.

03:26.566 --> 03:27.968
But Lee's a wonderful fellow.

03:28.336 --> 03:34.302
and he was a top sergeant in that outfit and I really enjoyed my year in the Corps.

03:34.322 --> 03:37.125
Now how did you happen to end up in that outfit?

03:37.145 --> 03:38.927
Was it by choice or?

03:38.947 --> 03:39.748
It was by choice.

03:39.768 --> 03:49.898
You were always given your choice of what outfit or what branch of the military you wanted to be in and I chose the Signal Corps to learn something.

03:51.099 --> 03:53.922
It sounded like a way to learn some

03:54.678 --> 03:57.601
technology without studying engineering.

04:00.504 --> 04:10.515
But like I say, I lived there a year and then Coach Bryant gave me, I mean Coach George gave me the scholarship and I moved back to Hart Hall.

04:10.856 --> 04:15.601
The, that year that you were over there, you were out for football.

04:17.363 --> 04:21.968
Did, when there were any pranks in the dormitory, did they leave, did the freshman leave you alone?

04:23.189 --> 04:23.790
Or were you,

04:24.175 --> 04:26.538
just about included like all the other sophomores?

04:28.800 --> 04:32.464
I felt as one of them.

04:32.485 --> 04:39.052
Those were good guys and I felt like that I fit in right with them.

04:40.133 --> 04:50.385
You have to understand my personality is I've been tested many times

04:50.990 --> 05:06.487
And I'm pretty far left on the introverted side, and therefore I'm quiet and unimposing and mind my business and, you know, go along to get along.

05:07.508 --> 05:08.590
I'm not a hell raiser.

05:09.711 --> 05:17.359
And I always feel like I have to prove myself.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.743
In every situation, I have to prove myself.

05:23.018 --> 05:31.988
whether it's playing football on the sandlot or on Kyle Field or teaching in the classroom or whatever.

05:32.709 --> 05:35.412
It stays that way your whole life.

05:35.432 --> 05:41.078
Any new situation, you have to prove to yourself that you're capable of doing it.

05:42.980 --> 05:49.267
Now, then that second year, did you have a football player as a roommate or?

05:49.968 --> 05:51.129
Oh, yes.

05:51.149 --> 05:52.030
Who was your...

05:54.997 --> 05:59.264
I roomed with my buddy from Aransas Pass, Hal Parks.

06:00.045 --> 06:01.407
Oh, how good, how good.

06:01.427 --> 06:02.909
Lifetime buddy, still is.

06:04.051 --> 06:08.017
They came up and went to the Oklahoma game with us this past fall.

06:08.037 --> 06:13.586
Did, what was the routine for y'all on a normal day?

06:14.627 --> 06:15.689
What time did you get up?

06:15.749 --> 06:18.013
What time did you do this, that, or the other?

06:19.915 --> 06:21.578
Oh, we'd get up about

06:22.874 --> 06:26.418
7 o'clock, 6.30 to 7.

06:28.481 --> 06:33.568
And we'd march up out in front of Hart Hall and march down to breakfast.

06:33.588 --> 06:36.291
And of course, have to be finished in class by 8 o'clock.

06:36.792 --> 06:40.977
And so the fact that y'all were athletes didn't matter about the routine and all that?

06:40.997 --> 06:42.319
No, sir.

06:42.339 --> 06:43.420
Same as everybody else.

06:43.440 --> 06:44.662
Did y'all go to class regularly?

06:46.264 --> 06:48.166
Whenever we had one scheduled.

06:48.186 --> 06:52.071
Every time we had one scheduled.

06:53.620 --> 07:02.053
And we marched, drilled every Thursday just like everybody else in the Corps did until Coach Bryant came.

07:02.093 --> 07:02.994
He changed all that.

07:03.475 --> 07:16.995
If you had any unscheduled time, hour or two during the day, where did you and or your buddies, where did y'all go to relax?

07:17.836 --> 07:19.364
to get ease?

07:19.525 --> 07:25.315
Well, if it was in the afternoon and still daylight, we would

07:26.003 --> 07:30.729
get a football or something and go out on the grass.

07:31.070 --> 07:34.654
No, not, I'm sorry, there was not any grass on the campus.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.397
None, not even a blade of grass.

07:36.897 --> 07:39.981
Remember I was there during the time it never rained?

07:40.562 --> 07:42.184
You've read Elmer's book, haven't you?

07:43.306 --> 07:44.567
One of the best books I've ever read.

07:45.188 --> 07:48.973
There wasn't a blade of grass on the campus, if you can believe that.

07:49.882 --> 07:55.907
did manage to get some going after a few years at the student center.

07:56.368 --> 08:04.755
You remember it opened in 1950, I believe it was, and of course you didn't walk on it and they got some grass, but outside of that there was no grass on the campus.

08:05.536 --> 08:11.761
We'd go over to the drill field which was just across a couple of streets or out beside Guyon Hall.

08:13.182 --> 08:18.707
If we had a little time in the evening when we should have been studying but didn't want to,

08:20.054 --> 08:34.672
We'd go over and sneak in Guy and Hawk and see a movie, and we got caught many times, and they'd just walk us down the front door and ask us to leave.

08:35.653 --> 08:43.362
Because you couldn't go back to your room and sleep, could you, very successfully, if you had an hour in the afternoon?

08:45.991 --> 08:48.515
The athletic dorm is a pretty loud place.

08:49.977 --> 09:00.754
And it's not conducive to good study time nor good sleeping time during, you know, daylight hours.

09:01.094 --> 09:02.516
What about the library?

09:02.576 --> 09:05.781
Did you all go over there and find a quiet corner sometime?

09:07.304 --> 09:08.746
Yes, sometime.

09:09.046 --> 09:11.570
Sometime we'd go over to the MSC and find a quiet corner.

09:11.630 --> 09:14.715
More likely because the MSC was a little bit closer to us.

09:15.286 --> 09:18.489
and find a quiet corner and get a cup of coffee or something over there.

09:19.951 --> 09:31.523
Honestly, your days were pretty busy when you're taking 18 hours, and then you're taking 18 hours and playing football.

09:32.945 --> 09:38.651
And my last semester, under Coach Bryant, I was taking 20 hours and playing football.

09:39.111 --> 09:41.354
There wasn't any free time.

09:41.374 --> 09:44.297
Are you aware of what the students think a full-time load is now?

09:44.918 --> 09:47.101
Well, I hear that it's not like it used to be.

09:47.441 --> 09:52.548
They think 12 hours is the normal full-time load, not the minimum minimum.

09:52.628 --> 09:56.834
They think that's normal and that 15 is a heavy load.

09:56.854 --> 10:00.098
And therefore, they don't expect to graduate in four years.

10:00.118 --> 10:01.440
Times have changed a good deal.

10:01.700 --> 10:03.803
Well, I don't know if it's for the better or not.

10:05.966 --> 10:06.487
Let's see.

10:10.712 --> 10:14.217
For you as a transfer, how did you get indoctrinated

10:14.618 --> 10:18.204
into all kinds of Aggie traditions, practices, myths.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.190
I got a book and taught myself.

10:24.275 --> 10:34.534
They had a book for freshmen that had all of the traditions and everything in it, and I studied that thing religiously.

10:34.683 --> 10:41.649
Do you remember ever in your first days that you didn't whip out correctly or didn't remember?

10:41.669 --> 10:43.771
Oh, goodness gracious, yes.

10:45.012 --> 10:48.395
And you talk about some butt-chewing.

10:49.376 --> 10:50.297
Oh, my goodness.

10:50.858 --> 10:59.506
I'll never forget one morning coming back from Cebiza mess hall to get ready to go to class.

10:59.526 --> 11:04.470
A senior walked up behind me and I,

11:05.513 --> 11:10.878
Guess I didn't say Heidi loud enough or didn't add sir to it or something.

11:12.659 --> 11:21.187
He stood me at attention on the sidewalk south of Sebesa Mess Hall for long enough to make me late for class.

11:22.148 --> 11:35.520
Chewing my butt like I had never been chewed before in my, I've often wished that I could remember his name because it really caught my attention about perhaps my lack of

11:42.638 --> 11:47.388
Fitting in according to the way the Corps did it.

11:47.849 --> 11:51.036
Living in Hart Hall, I was considered slovenly.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.584
My brass wasn't quite as polished.

11:54.624 --> 11:57.811
My shoes didn't shine as well.

11:59.254 --> 12:02.301
Maybe I didn't walk straight enough.

12:03.783 --> 12:12.054
And I didn't argue with that assessment, but I just realized that morning how they perceived athletes.

12:14.137 --> 12:18.122
And it really didn't make me angry other than that I hated to be late to class.

12:18.984 --> 12:22.268
You usually got a tail chewing for going into class late.

12:23.229 --> 12:31.140
Now, as far as you were aware in your first semesters here, or even all of them, were there any easy courses,

12:32.082 --> 12:33.787
in terms of grades for athletes?

12:34.228 --> 12:34.609
No, sir.

12:37.136 --> 12:37.999
Absolutely not.

12:38.039 --> 12:39.704
I've thought about that many times.

12:40.566 --> 12:47.526
I often wondered, did they slack off on Bob Smith or Darrell Hooper or, you know,

12:48.367 --> 12:52.872
I never saw any of that, Haskell, so help me, no.

12:53.012 --> 12:54.593
I've not heard, I've not heard of any.

12:54.653 --> 12:55.374
No, sir.

12:56.355 --> 13:05.845
And, all right, did you hear of any courses, though, that for everybody were a little easier to pass than some other courses?

13:06.986 --> 13:07.606
No.

13:07.626 --> 13:07.827
Really?

13:08.067 --> 13:08.908
No, sir, I'm sorry.

13:09.028 --> 13:13.092
I don't remember any courses in, of course, I'm in the College of Agriculture.

13:13.308 --> 13:24.901
Every course I took, it didn't make any difference if it was English or feeds and feeding or nutrition or history.

13:26.023 --> 13:29.387
Goodness gracious, they were tough.

13:29.407 --> 13:29.967
Who were some?

13:29.987 --> 13:31.029
For me, they were tough.

13:31.289 --> 13:33.592
Try to recall those semesters if you can.

13:33.652 --> 13:38.337
Who were some of the great people whose classes you took?

13:41.725 --> 13:43.587
The person and or the course.

13:48.294 --> 13:50.196
Well, there.

13:50.216 --> 13:51.678
Unless you're as great as memorable.

14:03.314 --> 14:06.518
There is a gentleman that's still living in College Station

14:08.388 --> 14:11.652
What's his name that taught me sociology?

14:12.213 --> 14:12.894
Barton Nelson?

14:13.675 --> 14:14.055
No sir.

14:17.439 --> 14:30.295
And I saw him about sometime last fall and just seeing his face made his name come to my mind immediately and I walked up and shook hands with him and he must be pushing 90 or so.

14:32.907 --> 14:37.211
It won't come to me right now, but I remember him so well.

14:38.632 --> 14:40.013
What made his course memorable?

14:45.358 --> 14:46.199
Everything about it.

14:47.240 --> 14:50.383
He was a person that believed in punctuality.

14:51.404 --> 14:52.124
Most of them did.

14:52.585 --> 14:54.767
Started on time, ended on time.

14:56.889 --> 14:57.770
No nonsense.

14:59.371 --> 15:01.513
Knew the subject, taught it well.

15:02.067 --> 15:07.675
When you got through with the course, you felt like that your time had been well spent and that you had been challenged.

15:08.556 --> 15:14.805
That's what I appreciate in a teacher, whether it's in first grade or in college.

15:16.027 --> 15:18.190
And there were so many of them.

15:18.571 --> 15:26.202
The only, and I ask myself many times if I'm being critical because I flunked the course, I flunked

15:26.620 --> 15:28.202
Freshman chemistry and that's all.

15:28.882 --> 15:36.250
In my eight years at A&M, I came back and went to vet school after my animal husbandry degree.

15:39.154 --> 15:48.804
My instructor in chemistry, freshman chemistry, was Chinese and I really had difficulty understanding him.

15:49.044 --> 15:55.311
I'm not using that as an excuse, but I thought that it was not right that

15:55.628 --> 15:59.834
I had to overcome that barrier and I was not able to.

15:59.874 --> 16:07.704
Chemistry, the reason I didn't pass freshman chemistry, I am sure, is because I did not take any chemistry in high school.

16:08.786 --> 16:11.489
That was my first exposure and that's a tough course.

16:12.871 --> 16:21.923
But that's the only instructor that I had that concerned me because of that one obstacle.

16:21.963 --> 16:24.066
I couldn't understand much of what he said.

16:24.215 --> 16:29.903
What about English, history, math?

16:32.306 --> 16:47.927
I remember taking English literature from a World War II veteran bachelor who

16:52.801 --> 17:07.828
In 1952 or three, probably two, when I took the course, he was a veteran of World War II, which had happened, what, 10 years previously.

17:08.590 --> 17:10.233
So he was in his early 30s.

17:12.317 --> 17:16.885
I remember him again, Eads.

17:18.518 --> 17:20.144
EADS, I believe.

17:20.425 --> 17:22.773
He was a bombardier on a B-24.

17:26.847 --> 17:30.199
And the amazing thing about this fellow

17:32.558 --> 17:43.509
I can see him this very moment in the academic building where I took English, standing, coming into class if there was a bell to sound the second for the hour.

17:43.589 --> 17:47.033
That's when he walked in, opened his briefcase, got his last night.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.755
He was there and he started.

17:51.117 --> 18:00.507
Each day he had on a different suit, a different pair of shoes, a different tie, and he was immaculately dressed.

18:01.482 --> 18:04.306
That was his trademark.

18:04.326 --> 18:05.227
Did he have a nickname?

18:06.108 --> 18:11.035
Probably, but I didn't participate.

18:11.936 --> 18:20.127
I'm sure he had several nicknames, but he knew his stuff and he was so demanding.

18:20.568 --> 18:26.115
If he caught you looking out the window, he told you.

18:26.135 --> 18:27.978
Did you ever go to sleep in class and get caught?

18:28.418 --> 18:29.059
No, sir.

18:29.697 --> 18:30.118
No, sir.

18:30.398 --> 18:32.020
What about history?

18:32.120 --> 18:32.941
Did you take history?

18:33.582 --> 18:34.403
Oh, absolutely.

18:36.626 --> 18:37.326
Screaming Owl?

18:38.728 --> 18:39.189
Yes.

18:41.572 --> 18:42.853
I had forgotten about him.

18:44.035 --> 18:47.619
And history was a tough course for me, too.

18:47.779 --> 18:52.245
My goodness, I've got some of my papers over there on my desk now.

18:53.862 --> 18:56.165
I think one of them is 84 and one of them is 88.

18:56.205 --> 18:57.987
That's a pretty good grade for me in history.

18:59.288 --> 19:04.335
Then in animal science, did you by chance have a class from Professor Butler?

19:05.015 --> 19:05.776
Oh, absolutely.

19:06.217 --> 19:08.780
Describe Butler as a faculty, as a teacher.

19:08.840 --> 19:14.707
Well, of course, he was in his early years, O.D., sir, Dr.

19:14.807 --> 19:17.270
O.D., sir.

19:19.092 --> 19:23.177
He was spitting polish.

19:23.461 --> 19:36.619
It seemed like that he was just one of a battalion of instructors that were trained by the military to do everything precisely.

19:36.639 --> 19:37.520
That's the way he did it.

19:38.121 --> 19:39.563
And he was extremely demanding.

19:40.104 --> 19:41.446
He was extremely sharp.

19:41.486 --> 19:43.889
He knew his material front and backwards.

19:44.390 --> 19:46.553
He taught both lab and lecture and meets.

19:46.633 --> 19:49.357
He was teaching meets, of course, then.

19:50.879 --> 19:53.282
And he was just good.

19:53.701 --> 20:00.471
There's only one thing that I criticize Dr. Butler for, bless his heart, and that's before he died I criticize him.

20:00.491 --> 20:03.055
I don't criticize him for anything anymore since he's passed.

20:05.218 --> 20:17.717
When I came back to A&M in 1960 to go to vet school, I was married and I had three children and I wanted to be a veterinarian by this time so I'd have a better chance of getting ahead in the world.

20:19.030 --> 20:25.519
The first ranch job I applied for, $300 a month in a little shack to live in with three kids.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.143
I told him I can't make it on that.

20:28.163 --> 20:29.765
So I never became a ranch manager.

20:31.968 --> 20:36.254
I went to see Dr. Butler, and I told him I was coming back to school.

20:37.075 --> 20:37.957
And he said, oh, great.

20:38.658 --> 20:41.422
But I said, Dr. Butler, I'm going to study veterinary medicine.

20:44.125 --> 20:45.047
What for?

20:46.749 --> 20:48.852
Why don't you take a PhD program here?

20:50.114 --> 20:50.955
You know how you could be.

20:51.856 --> 20:55.098
I said, well, sir, I made up my mind and I need a job badly.

20:55.118 --> 20:59.042
I've got a family and I've got to work, yep, work my way through school.

20:59.762 --> 21:05.968
He said, I'm sorry, but we only give jobs to our program students.

21:05.988 --> 21:07.129
You'll have to look elsewhere.

21:07.169 --> 21:08.470
And that really disappointed me.

21:09.231 --> 21:10.512
But anyway, that's the way it was.

21:13.014 --> 21:13.374
Let's see.

21:13.735 --> 21:20.020
As you're going into your sophomore, junior year, what did you do in the summers?

21:22.463 --> 21:23.924
Back home?

21:24.565 --> 21:27.548
No, not necessarily back home.

21:27.828 --> 21:31.591
The first summer of 51 I went to back to Sinton.

21:33.133 --> 21:35.755
There was a reason for it of course.

21:36.636 --> 21:50.428
I had left a little girlfriend back there and that was one of my reasons for my unhappiness of having to move to Dallas is leaving my little sweetheart behind and so

21:51.117 --> 22:00.850
I decided I had an uncle that lived in Sinton, my daddy's brother, and so I lived with them that summer and I worked as a roughneck in the oil fields.

22:01.631 --> 22:03.334
What kind of money did a roughneck make then?

22:07.880 --> 22:08.401
Good money.

22:11.665 --> 22:19.656
We made about 90 cents an hour and the driller made, I believe,

22:20.108 --> 22:24.674
$1.35 an hour, and the tool pusher made, I think, $1.55 an hour.

22:24.694 --> 22:26.625
And you all worked long hours, too, did you?

22:27.314 --> 22:28.215
No, I'm sorry.

22:28.716 --> 22:29.136
I'm sorry.

22:30.138 --> 22:31.559
In those days, you worked three shifts.

22:32.260 --> 22:32.561
Yeah.

22:32.601 --> 22:36.165
But work long hours, yes, because... Seven days a week, wasn't it?

22:36.205 --> 22:37.467
Seven days a week.

22:37.487 --> 22:41.472
And in that bunch, there's always those that don't show up for work.

22:41.592 --> 22:46.058
So they always ask you to double over and work 16 hours, and I did that many times.

22:46.619 --> 22:51.465
I worked the graveyard midnight shift, and many times I'd work on through until 4 o'clock the next afternoon.

22:51.485 --> 22:53.167
And down in the Centen area?

22:54.369 --> 22:54.509
Mm-hmm.

22:54.549 --> 22:55.971
Between Centen and Taft.

22:55.951 --> 23:01.343
So that the Texas A&M didn't have any, they didn't get you that job.

23:01.584 --> 23:02.005
No way.

23:03.107 --> 23:04.350
Then after the next year.

23:05.974 --> 23:13.892
The next year I worked in Dallas for Austin Bridge Company.

23:15.492 --> 23:41.504
Pouring concrete, building foundation on big grain elevators there west of Dallas all summer long, working with a jackhammer and a cement vibrator, concrete vibrator, in the heat of the drought.

23:42.946 --> 23:43.947
But I was young.

23:46.660 --> 23:47.761
All right.

23:48.121 --> 23:56.068
And when you came to school each fall, do you have any idea about how much money you brought with you for spending money?

23:56.789 --> 23:57.149
What did?

24:00.251 --> 24:06.837
I brought two or three hundred?

24:12.522 --> 24:14.223
Probably not two or three hundred.

24:14.804 --> 24:16.465
I bought clothes and

24:17.356 --> 24:21.947
shoes and all kinds of things that needed to be replaced.

24:22.889 --> 24:28.683
I probably came back with more than a hundred dollars, but my goodness.

24:28.703 --> 24:29.445
That was a lot of money.

24:30.046 --> 24:31.149
It was plenty of money.

24:31.469 --> 24:34.757
Did you, in general, did you pay your

24:35.463 --> 24:36.705
Pretty well your total way through.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.367
Everything after that, yes.

24:39.408 --> 24:48.661
But understand I was, had the ROTC contract, 90 cents a day, which was $27 a month, plus what I made during the summertime.

24:49.723 --> 24:51.565
And then when you got the scholarship.

24:52.426 --> 24:56.312
Scholarship paid for everything, plus $12 a month for laundry.

24:57.674 --> 24:58.315
I was flush.

24:59.837 --> 25:04.423
Well, now you came to, when you arrived that first year, you had a car.

25:04.825 --> 25:05.225
Oh, no.

25:05.446 --> 25:07.508
Oh, I thought you said you had a car you came in.

25:07.789 --> 25:09.210
I came in the family car.

25:09.230 --> 25:09.491
Oh, oh, oh.

25:09.511 --> 25:12.134
I deprived my family of the car for a week.

25:12.154 --> 25:14.316
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

25:14.336 --> 25:15.818
All right.

25:15.838 --> 25:17.300
So did you ever have wheels?

25:18.201 --> 25:18.681
Oh, no.

25:18.701 --> 25:18.962
Okay.

25:19.082 --> 25:19.402
No, sir.

25:19.482 --> 25:27.131
How that, during that first year, that first semester here, about how often did you go back home to Dallas?

25:28.593 --> 25:30.055
The first semester, maybe.

25:30.355 --> 25:31.517
Spring break?

25:31.537 --> 25:33.379
Maybe twice.

25:33.399 --> 25:33.499
And.

25:33.519 --> 25:34.360
Yeah, spring break.

25:34.610 --> 25:36.933
How did you get, how did you make that, did you hitchhike?

25:37.974 --> 25:40.377
Describe Aggie hitchhiking.

25:40.397 --> 25:41.038
A breeze.

25:45.142 --> 25:54.393
Go up to the east gate, generally after Saturday morning class and the noon meal.

25:56.115 --> 26:00.601
Walk to the east gate and stand in line.

26:01.402 --> 26:04.245
Might be a hundred there, might be a hundred and fifty.

26:05.137 --> 26:07.681
Everybody that came by in a car stopped and filled up.

26:08.703 --> 26:11.247
And you were there less than an hour.

26:12.729 --> 26:15.514
And people were happy to give you a ride.

26:16.195 --> 26:20.842
Did you ever have a negative Aggie hitchhiking experience?

26:22.445 --> 26:23.827
Not negative, but scary.

26:24.047 --> 26:24.488
Such as?

26:25.109 --> 26:30.638
Hitchhiking to Sinton and Aransas Pass, my bud roommate and I.

26:31.850 --> 26:49.453
We decided once that we'd go through Houston to try to get a little better, instead of trying to go off down through Branham and the backwoods that way, we'd go through Houston and then get on, what is it, 59, I forgot, going southwest.

26:50.515 --> 26:57.624
We hitchhiked to Houston with no problem and we're in downtown Houston.

26:58.625 --> 26:59.967
I mean with the big buildings.

27:01.229 --> 27:29.093
and you can't hitchhike in downtown Houston so we got on a bus, a city bus and rode out to the west side of town and got out and we got out there about six o'clock yeah about six o'clock in the afternoon and understand we left at one o'clock and we had to be back at eight o'clock on Monday

27:29.782 --> 27:34.107
And we had this 240 miles times two trip to make.

27:35.348 --> 27:36.630
Never concerned us at all.

27:37.551 --> 27:43.357
We stood there on that west side of Houston thumbing and thumbing and thumbing until we were blue in the face.

27:43.537 --> 27:44.939
Those people would not stop.

27:46.441 --> 27:52.307
Until about 10.30 at night.

27:53.348 --> 27:55.671
We'd been standing there on the street all the time.

27:56.815 --> 28:08.171
A Mexican fellow who barely spoke English stopped and picked us up, and he was seven sheets to the wind.

28:09.753 --> 28:10.554
We didn't care.

28:11.615 --> 28:14.379
He was on his way to Corpus Christi.

28:20.267 --> 28:25.354
And we got in that car, and he got out on open road, and I'm telling you, 85.

28:26.077 --> 28:28.100
and it wasn't in a straight line.

28:29.582 --> 28:39.837
Hit the rough side and all over the road and so we learned that if we'd engage him in conversation, he'd slow down.

28:39.857 --> 28:50.111
We spent the next four hours talking to him to keep him from driving so wild and recklessly and he took us right down to Sinton.

28:50.652 --> 28:54.177
We got there at 2 o'clock in the morning.

28:54.157 --> 28:58.463
And I don't remember where we found a public telephone.

28:58.984 --> 29:08.257
We found a phone somewhere and Hal still had to go the 26 miles to Aransas Pass and he called his mother and his mother came up there and got us, got him.

29:08.698 --> 29:10.220
I stayed in Sinton.

29:10.881 --> 29:16.890
I was there to see my girlfriend again and I stayed with my uncle and

29:19.064 --> 29:21.987
That was 2 o'clock Sunday morning.

29:22.007 --> 29:26.771
Well, at 1 o'clock on Sunday afternoon, we got to head back in another direction.

29:27.752 --> 29:35.298
I got up in time to go to church on Sunday morning and meet my girlfriend and sit in church with her and tell her goodbye.

29:36.499 --> 29:37.080
Head back.

29:37.120 --> 29:37.660
Head back.

29:37.821 --> 29:42.765
Now, during those years at A&M, how did you communicate with your family?

29:43.886 --> 29:44.326
By letter.

29:46.608 --> 29:48.430
And about how often do you remember?

29:49.557 --> 29:53.121
My mom wrote more often than I did.

29:53.181 --> 29:54.903
Once a week?

29:58.347 --> 30:01.531
Probably a couple of times a month.

30:01.551 --> 30:03.052
Okay.

30:03.072 --> 30:05.655
But there's one thing that I remember about my mom.

30:07.297 --> 30:13.464
Every time that she sent me a letter, she put a one dollar bill in it.

30:13.484 --> 30:14.005
Oh, really?

30:14.145 --> 30:15.126
Every time.

30:16.253 --> 30:20.066
And did you think those were to be used for anything special?

30:22.574 --> 30:22.795
No.

30:22.815 --> 30:26.668
I thought that mom sent it because she felt like I needed it.

30:27.880 --> 30:32.268
But was it all right to spend that dollar for extra food or a movie?

30:32.388 --> 30:33.510
Absolutely.

30:34.412 --> 30:35.694
And did you send them copies?

30:35.754 --> 30:37.397
Did you let them know what your grades were?

30:38.119 --> 30:38.700
Absolutely.

30:39.081 --> 30:40.042
I didn't have any choice.

30:40.122 --> 30:42.387
In those days, they sent a copy home.

30:43.809 --> 30:45.512
I didn't have any choice in it.

30:45.893 --> 30:48.358
But my grades did all right after the first semester.

30:49.119 --> 30:51.323
I was not an exemplary student.

30:51.623 --> 30:56.690
I was a young student who wanted to be there, so B's and C's were mostly my thing.

30:58.573 --> 31:01.377
I didn't learn how to be a good student until I went to vet school.

31:03.420 --> 31:06.284
Now, did you get involved in any good bull or any pranks?

31:09.769 --> 31:10.490
Not very many.

31:11.311 --> 31:12.092
I will say this.

31:16.258 --> 31:17.800
First place, I didn't want to get in trouble.

31:18.910 --> 31:24.955
I loved where I was and I loved what I was doing and I wanted to be here and I wanted to stay here.

31:26.317 --> 31:29.339
I loved Texas A&M just like I do to this very day.

31:31.501 --> 31:34.644
But Bobby Dixon, I started to tell you this story once.

31:35.305 --> 31:40.189
Bobby Dixon was the big tackle on the football team, senior when I was a sophomore.

31:40.669 --> 31:47.095
And he was always coming in late on Saturday night or Sunday morning and harassing everybody, kicking.
