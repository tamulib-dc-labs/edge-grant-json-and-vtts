WEBVTT

00:03.187 --> 00:16.960
It's a...

00:03.187 --> 00:16.960
First, how did you arrive at the name of the 
scientist and the location of the plant you wanted

00:03.187 --> 00:16.960
to go to in Germany? Well, before we left the United 
States, we had made up a complete list of the

00:16.980 --> 00:28.491
co-hydrogenation plants and the facial trough 
plants. People who had... corresponded with the

00:30.625 --> 00:35.633
Germans and had been in Germany and knew the 
location of plants. And we had all corresponded

00:36.434 --> 00:45.950
with German scientists of one kind or another 
during our experimental work and our early work.

00:46.631 --> 00:50.737
So we had a pretty good idea of the major people that 
were going to be involved. And from them we learned

00:50.838 --> 00:55.485
about other people and so on and so on. We started 
out with a good itinerary, I think, and then

00:56.208 --> 01:02.598
expanded it as we got into the Germans. Okay. Well, 
you seem to know as early as 43 that you're going to

01:02.738 --> 01:07.646
pick these plants out. That seemed awfully early 
to me to realize where the plants were

01:08.006 --> 01:11.392
historically. Oh, no. I think we knew the location 
of most of the German colonization plants, even in

01:13.875 --> 01:21.087
the late 30s and early 40s. We knew all of that. See, 
they're very big plants. And of course, we were

01:24.416 --> 01:28.520
greatly involved in this technology in the Vera 
Mines. We had been working on it seven or eight

01:28.600 --> 01:32.224
years in the Vera Mines. So we knew most of this 
material. And there had been articles published

01:35.146 --> 01:42.473
about the plants and things like that and their 
building and their construction and so on and so

01:35.146 --> 01:42.473
forth. So through the technical literature and 
through correspondence and through the

01:42.493 --> 01:49.620
knowledge of these German scientists, we had a 
pretty good picture of what we were going to see and

01:49.955 --> 01:55.661
where we were going to see it and who we were going to 
see it. Well, I'm amazed, too, that you talk in your

01:55.681 --> 02:02.809
article about the way that bombing slowed down the 
production of synthetic fuels. It doesn't seem to

02:03.270 --> 02:05.272
have done that in other industries. Why synthetic 
fuels?

02:10.398 --> 02:13.161
I can't answer that question completely, but I 
think it was because they did know the location of

02:15.723 --> 02:22.930
the plants, and they were very big plants. And

02:22.950 --> 02:34.401
the Americans took over that daylight bombing, 
and I think they got over these plants and hit them

02:22.950 --> 02:34.401
very, very heavily. So the time we got over there, a 
lot of these plants were a wreck, really. What did

02:45.136 --> 02:47.078
the British do exactly? Were they all alone from 
the planning from 43 on and going into these plans?

02:52.545 --> 02:55.008
And did they take separate or duplicate records? 
The British, when we were organizing our teams

02:56.911 --> 03:13.651
here in the United States in late 43, I guess it was, 
wait a minute, the war ended in 45, didn't it?

03:14.092 --> 03:14.232
Mm-hmm. In late, in 44 and early 45 when we were 
organizing our teams in this country, the British

03:14.768 --> 03:23.778
were doing the same thing. They were organizing 
teams in Great Britain to go into these plants. And

03:29.104 --> 03:37.213
you know the British had one coal hydrogenation 
plant at Billingham, England that was already

03:29.104 --> 03:37.213
operating. And they had, they had corresponded 
with IG Farben to a very large extent. And in fact, I

03:46.156 --> 03:54.349
think IG Farber had assisted the British in the 
design of this plant, probably to some extent in

03:46.156 --> 03:54.349
construction. So the British were very familiar 
with what was going on in Germany, and they

03:54.369 --> 03:59.577
organized their own teams. Actually, when we got 
into the field, we were often combined. It often

04:04.785 --> 04:14.560
was a team made up of partly British and partly 
Americans, or it might have been a complete

04:04.785 --> 04:14.560
American team, or it might be a complete British 
team. But we work cooperatively throughout. And a

04:18.517 --> 04:23.724
lot of the reports are written by partly British 
and partly American. Well, did they select a

04:25.186 --> 04:28.590
different sort of records to take back to Britain, 
I wonder? No, I think we all had pretty much the same

04:28.630 --> 04:31.174
records. And I think they had copies of all of our 
reports, and we had copies of all of their reports.

04:38.964 --> 04:42.589
How did you decide which material to eliminate 
when you wrote your reports? you speak of

04:43.143 --> 04:49.571
eliminating some material.

04:49.591 --> 04:53.696
I don't remember that we eliminated much of 
anything. We tried to

04:54.958 --> 05:12.120
cover in our own reports practically every phase 
of technology which had any new aspects to

04:54.958 --> 05:12.120
it. In addition to that, we often brought back 
German documents as supplementary to what we had

05:13.535 --> 05:22.024
written and so on and so on. But

05:23.585 --> 05:37.500
I really don't remember that there was any process 
of elimination except that we might decide that

05:37.868 --> 05:44.544
The material that we saw in the file or something 
like that was routine records, business records,

05:37.868 --> 05:44.544
and things like that. And we dropped those because 
they had no technologic interest to us at all.

05:51.554 --> 05:52.856
Those we didn't care about. We didn't care whether 
the Germans sold 10,000 tons a day or whether they

05:52.877 --> 05:59.469
sold 1,000 tons a day or who paid for it. Yeah, I 
should have jotted the page down, but you say

05:59.489 --> 06:14.237
you're talking about in 1945, you're talking 
about difficulties you're going to have in

05:59.489 --> 06:14.237
assuming this material, absorbing this material 
and releasing it later on, and you talk about the

05:59.489 --> 06:14.237
volume material and you say, well, some was... was 
automatically eliminated. Well, I think it was.

06:17.644 --> 06:24.994
But I think it was largely routine material that we 
felt added nothing to our understanding of the

06:17.644 --> 06:24.994
plants or the technology. OK. Along that line, and 
it says

06:28.980 --> 06:39.054
you talk about all microfilming is really what 
you're talking about. And Odell, is that how you

06:39.956 --> 06:43.040
pronounce his name? Odell. Odell, OK. and Odell is 
discussing a process, and you say, well, I suppose

06:44.744 --> 06:55.382
all this is getting microfilmed, or we're getting 
copies of the microfilm, and you say just certain

06:44.744 --> 06:55.382
copies of the microfilm. In the cases of Mr. 
Odell's report, we know that he has written it from

06:55.943 --> 07:03.595
notes taken immediately on the field and placed 
very little reliance upon the microfilms. And I

07:05.539 --> 07:10.667
really couldn't understand exactly, it's 
talking about carbon dioxide content in a, and

07:11.137 --> 07:13.940
slagging units is in the capacity. I really 
couldn't understand exactly what that had to do

07:14.461 --> 07:17.885
with report writing. Is that were most of the 
reports written from the field notes or most of

07:18.466 --> 07:22.611
them from the microfilm documents? Most of them 
were written from the field notes. From the field

07:24.653 --> 07:27.336
notes. Yeah. And then did you go back later on and 
check the microfilm documents?

07:33.083 --> 07:36.728
That, I guess, was up to the individual authors. In 
some cases, I think they probably did. In some

07:38.690 --> 07:40.452
cases, they probably didn't.

07:44.498 --> 07:49.883
Well, it seems to me there's a tremendous, the best 
I can tell from everything, there's a tremendous

07:44.498 --> 07:49.883
amount of microfilm documents. And I'm having a 
very hard time sorting through and seeing what the

07:49.903 --> 07:54.428
follow-up was. I can't at all feel certain that the 
microfilms were extensively relied upon in

07:54.448 --> 08:05.058
writing these reports. I think it was mostly field 
notes.

08:09.983 --> 08:14.387
How were the original 23 investigators chosen who 
went to Germany? We had meetings here in

08:16.780 --> 08:34.351
Washington

08:16.780 --> 08:34.351
between the oil people and mainly the Bureau of 
Mines and some of the people in the Department of

08:16.780 --> 08:34.351
Interior. And all of those meetings, there were 
four or five of those meetings, Out of those

08:41.283 --> 08:49.094
meetings, the oil people suggested certain 
people that they wanted, thought to be qualified

08:41.283 --> 08:49.094
for the mission. Bear in mind, they suggested a 
number of people, and out of that came the first 23

08:49.114 --> 08:57.586
people. Yeah, there seems an argument evolves, 
best I can tell. The argument seems to evolve here.

09:02.072 --> 09:05.637
Some people agree to go and then back up, and some 
people join later on. I think that's right. Was

09:07.426 --> 09:09.328
there some sort of a complication? I don't think 
there was any complication. I think oftentimes it

09:14.614 --> 09:25.185
was a question of the man's, well, first, how badly 
he was needed here in the United States. Could he

09:25.285 --> 09:29.930
give up the time to go on a month or two expedition 
into Germany? And then it was a few questions of

09:30.070 --> 09:35.556
people's age and health that were involved. Did 
you attend the 1941 meeting with Hickeys when it

09:37.544 --> 09:45.354
calls together 1,000 of the most prominent men in 
the oil industry? No.

09:50.403 --> 09:51.864
All right. Obviously, your scrapbook has 
demonstrated you began earlier than I thought you

09:52.865 --> 09:58.770
did, so I'm not sure that question is relevant 
anymore. But I was wondering, as early as 1941

09:59.231 --> 10:06.837
then, he's already calling forth 1,000 people 
from the oil industry to talk about synthetic

09:59.231 --> 10:06.837
fuels? Yeah, I expect so. Who was C.S. Snodgrass?

10:12.823 --> 10:20.089
Snodgrass was in the Trojan War. Petroleum 
Administration for War, is that right? Yeah.

10:25.079 --> 10:37.853
Snodgrass was, I don't remember his exact 
position, but he was in the Petroleum

10:25.079 --> 10:37.853
Administration for War and took a very active part 
in organizing these teams and so on and so forth.

10:37.873 --> 10:42.618
And he knew the Petroleum Industry well, and he 
knew the Department of Interior fairly well.

10:43.179 --> 10:45.421
Actually, Snodgrass was a very good friend of 
mine. Well, I don't know whether he's still in it or

10:46.463 --> 10:48.625
not. I

10:50.883 --> 10:57.509
was going to ask you if you knew Snodgrass now. 
You've already answered that question. Is he the

10:58.950 --> 11:03.294
one who brings you actively into this synthetic 
oil search? No, no, I think I wouldn't say that, but

11:04.516 --> 11:11.902
he brought a lot of the oil people into the search. 
Describe him. What was he like? What's his

11:13.023 --> 11:13.804
background? I can't find anything out about him.

11:19.750 --> 11:20.130
He's His background was, he had been, I can't give 
you too much of his background to tell you the

11:20.279 --> 11:27.970
truth. He had been in the oil industry for quite a 
while and he knew quite a lot of the technology of

11:27.990 --> 11:44.515
the oil and gas industry and had quite a bit of 
administrative experience. And then I don't know

11:45.372 --> 11:56.125
exactly how he got into the Petroleum 
Administration for War, but I'm sure it's through

11:45.372 --> 11:56.125
one of the outcome is that he appears in the 
Petroleum Administration for War. Why was the

11:57.167 --> 12:00.971
military not included in this search from the 
beginning? Now, the Navy evidently is very

12:00.991 --> 12:02.754
interested. Why not the Army? The Navy

12:03.435 --> 12:14.248
decided to organize their own group of people to go 
over there and investigate synthetic films. And

12:15.123 --> 12:22.452
Pettyjohn, the man you're going to see, he was head 
of the Institute of Gas Technology. Pettyjohn was

12:23.333 --> 12:29.360
a commander, I believe, in the Navy, and was very 
active in the Navy. And he got into this fairly

12:30.181 --> 12:40.433
early, and he thought that a military team, 
particularly a Navy team, could do a better job

12:30.181 --> 12:40.433
than a civilian team. And in a way, the two teams 
competed they covered somewhat the same targets

12:43.118 --> 13:12.012
we covered and i don't know what happened to their 
documents did they write reports too yes i'm sure

12:43.118 --> 13:12.012
they did okay and uh

12:43.118 --> 13:12.012
now what what i need to do now is to go over these 
charts which i have labeled one two and three and

12:43.118 --> 13:12.012
they're obviously your charts because there were 
some things about going over the charts i couldn't

12:43.118 --> 13:12.012
understand from a You know exactly how advice and 
so forth put in. Chart one is called the

13:16.035 --> 13:22.762
Organizational Structure for the Oil Mission in 
1944 and 1945.

13:25.124 --> 13:32.712
Now here you see, this is where the Fuels and 
Lubricants Subcommittee, where Snodgaris is

13:25.124 --> 13:32.712
chairman. A Technical Industrial Intelligence 
Committee. Now were these people from the oil

13:36.515 --> 13:41.340
industry itself, or was this you? No, I think that 
was mainly from the oil industry. But it might also

13:47.310 --> 13:51.475
have included some government people, but I was 
not on it. I was not on it. And then here's CIOs, you

13:52.456 --> 13:56.301
know, the Combined Intelligence Objectives 
Committee. All right, now, so is the technical oil

13:56.721 --> 14:05.753
mission feeding information both to the TIIC and 
to the CIOS? I suspect so. OK. So information flows

14:08.336 --> 14:10.158
both ways. Both ways. Both ways.

14:14.378 --> 14:21.925
Now, and then the TIIC, what relationship does it 
have to the Fuels and Lubricants Subcommittee? Is

14:22.005 --> 14:22.945
this a directive? I think this is part of the 
technical. Oh, OK. Yeah. All right, I see. And I

14:27.930 --> 14:34.535
didn't even remember that Snodgrass was chairman 
of that, but I think I do now that you note it here.

14:35.436 --> 14:36.457
All right, and so. Comforth, I had forgotten 
completely. He,

14:38.279 --> 14:43.423
however.

14:48.550 --> 14:51.133
I remember this faintly now.

14:55.397 --> 15:13.275
Petty John and his group in the Navy went over there 
as a Navy group, and I think they had their path more

14:55.397 --> 15:13.275
or less laid out as a Navy group, and didn't have 
much trouble getting over there. We, on the other

15:14.577 --> 15:16.819
hand, were all civilians. and we had no business in 
the war zone. So we had to be

15:20.922 --> 15:36.301
taken in in the Army on some status or another, and 
we had to have uniforms and so on and so forth, so we

15:20.922 --> 15:36.301
weren't arrested for spies over there, some darn 
thing like that. And Comforth, it seems to me that

15:37.582 --> 15:42.368
he arranged most of this stuff with the, through 
the Army so that we could be processed through the

15:42.905 --> 15:54.647
Army and could fly over there and could fly into the 
combat zones and so on and so forth. All right.

15:55.268 --> 15:58.755
You're forcing me to rely heavily on 30 years ago. 
Oh, I know it's hard to do. All right. It says

16:02.429 --> 16:09.817
Combined Intelligence Objective Subcommittee, 
all right, which is, you know, again, CIOS. This is

16:09.837 --> 16:10.598
from Britain. The Bureau of Mines, all right? 
Yeah, right. All right. Now then, and out of here

16:14.923 --> 16:19.488
come the translated reports. But the Combined 
Intelligence Objective Subcommittee included

16:20.009 --> 16:27.277
not only people from the Bureau of Mines, but also 
the people from the oil industry. All right, so the

16:27.297 --> 16:30.360
oil industry was involved in, in the Combined 
Intelligence Subcommittee here. And

16:33.726 --> 16:41.580
then it was from this work to the Translated 
Reports King. Now, it says 306 rolls of microfilm,

16:43.563 --> 16:48.171
which were German. And they go to the Library of 
Congress. And from the Library of Congress,

16:52.278 --> 16:54.863
they're to go out to industry. Now, are these the 
reels of microfilm from which a series of five

16:55.163 --> 17:02.492
indexes were published?

17:04.154 --> 17:06.577
I never saw those microfilms. I knew we were making 
microfilms, but I never saw them. Okay. And then

17:12.424 --> 17:17.069
the translated reports go on into the American 
Petroleum Institute technical oil mission.

17:17.090 --> 17:17.750
Yeah, right. Now, what does the film study groups 
do? I couldn't understand how they fit into

17:19.613 --> 17:22.336
dissemination of information. I don't know that 
either. See, when I came back here, and probably a

17:24.442 --> 17:36.382
lot of that film studying was done back here in the 
United States, I wasn't involved in that because I

17:24.442 --> 17:36.382
went back to my old task of running synthetic fuels 
for the Bureau of Mines. Oh, okay. So while I knew a

17:37.444 --> 17:51.006
lot about this, I knew this was all going on, and I 
knew the reports were all being edited and that

17:37.444 --> 17:51.006
they had a technical group, which included some of 
the Bureau of Mines people, but was mainly

17:37.444 --> 17:51.006
petroleum people. and that they were trying to get 
out final reports on this thing. And that's the way

17:56.142 --> 17:58.364
it was done. Let's see if we've got any. Have you got 
any of the old reports? Yeah, yeah. I've got some.

18:04.291 --> 18:07.194
You know how they're put together and so on and so 
forth. Well, let me see if I've got some here.

18:13.121 --> 18:15.463
One thing here on tape. Come on now. There we go. 
Now, I realize there was a close contact between

18:17.986 --> 18:21.950
Standard Oil and Farben. I didn't realize there 
was a contact between the British and the German

18:22.231 --> 18:26.235
synthetic oil production. I wonder when that 
develops. Well, that must have started, the

18:28.178 --> 18:38.850
British started their work on coal 
hydrogenation, if my memory serves me well, about

18:28.178 --> 18:38.850
the early 1930s, 31 or 32. And that was all started 
at Billingham, England, just in the northeastern

18:39.170 --> 18:46.238
part of England. And then later on, the British 
built a coal-hydrogenation plant. And I think

18:52.964 --> 19:01.456
this was essentially after the Burgess design and 
followed closely the types of plants that were

18:52.964 --> 19:01.456
being built in Germany at that point. And they ran 
that plant for several years prior to the war. I

19:07.144 --> 19:09.528
think they were working on coal-hydrogenation 
then. But then during the war, I think they went

19:09.568 --> 19:14.335
over to tar-hydrogenation because they could get 
more products out there. And they used that plant

19:14.737 --> 19:19.281
to make aviation gasoline during the war. And I'm 
sure people like Kenneth Gordon and so on and so

19:19.301 --> 19:35.915
forth, and Holroyd, who were with ICI, were well 
acquainted with the people in Germany who were

19:19.301 --> 19:35.915
doing the work on co-hydrogenation.

19:35.975 --> 19:40.298
And don't forget, Dr. Calvert, what's your first 
name? Bob. Bob, I knew that. And don't forget

19:43.121 --> 19:44.642
that...

19:47.896 --> 19:54.363
that this whole German technology had been 
evolving over a period of 20 years. And of course,

19:55.204 --> 20:04.574
the people who were interested in coal work were 
well aware of what the Germans were doing all this

19:55.204 --> 20:04.574
20 year period of time. And then when it finally 
evolved, I think they put up their first plant in

20:04.614 --> 20:08.799
about 1925. So there was great technical interest 
in that plant. And the British, I think the British

20:14.705 --> 20:17.548
thought that Great Britain has never had any 
substantial supply of oil until they brought in

20:18.592 --> 20:24.463
the North Sea oil. And I think the British thought 
that they would eventually be producing oil from

20:24.963 --> 20:29.892
coal in England. The situation has turned out to be 
quite different really, but that's what they

20:30.834 --> 20:35.482
thought at that time. So that was why they built 
that first coal hydrogenation plant.

20:42.554 --> 20:48.922
So the translated reports go to the American 
Petroleum Institute of Technical Oil and Mission

20:42.554 --> 20:48.922
Study Group. And this says Publication Board of 
Department of Commerce to Industry.

20:56.612 --> 21:05.503
This group, I think you told me, and as I remember, 
was headed by Al Miller from Sinclair Oil Company

20:56.612 --> 21:05.503
at that time. They've since gone into another. 
Who's Sinclair going to? I don't know. I never can

21:11.929 --> 21:12.870
remember. I can never remember the combination 
either. But that group functioned for a couple of

21:15.952 --> 21:19.055
years. And then it was going to break up. And at that 
time, the Department of Commerce decided that

21:24.100 --> 21:29.485
they would become the depository for these 
reports. And I think they also distributed a lot of

21:30.526 --> 21:34.690
these reports for people who wanted them later on. 
And later on, it broke up. And then I don't know what

21:37.152 --> 21:39.274
happened to the rest of it. to the story. OK. And 
then so I see then, so the reports translated here,

21:40.992 --> 21:49.263
went here, and then on to industry as industry 
called for them. Yeah, right, right. Now, I

21:52.467 --> 21:58.875
had a terrible time with this one. Our Petroleum 
Administration for the War, Secretary of

21:59.756 --> 22:02.659
Interior, Ickes. I can understand that. Now, the 
Petroleum Industry War Council I wonder what in

22:07.317 --> 22:10.640
the world it did with William R. Boyd as chairman.

22:15.825 --> 22:16.586
I didn't remember. I guess Boyd was chairman. I 
didn't know that. I was never in on any meetings of

22:19.389 --> 22:23.954
the Petroleum Industry War Council. But they 
advised the Department of Interior, and I think

22:25.535 --> 22:33.443
the government generally, As to the oil situation 
and supplying the allies with oil and moving oil

22:35.178 --> 22:53.754
around this country and meeting the submarine 
threat and transporting oil from your state of

22:35.178 --> 22:53.754
Texas up to the east, you remember the submarines 
were sinking ships at a hell of a rate there. And I

22:53.774 --> 23:01.781
think this group was trying to coordinate the 
petroleum industry with the war effort, largely

22:53.774 --> 23:01.781
done through ICAS. Okay. All right. And then we 
have technical committees and technical

23:04.945 --> 23:08.972
advisories. R.E. Wilson at that time, he was 
president of the Standard Oil Company of Indiana,

23:09.132 --> 23:14.662
as I remember it.

23:18.148 --> 23:24.919
And I really don't know what his function was, 
because these were committees that I was not

23:18.148 --> 23:24.919
involved with. Okay, but what about the special 
advisory group down here in 1945?

23:32.519 --> 23:33.420
I wasn't involved. You weren't involved in that? 
No. OK. I have you somehow connected with the

23:35.903 --> 23:39.467
Special Advisory Bureau. I don't know why I put it.

23:45.254 --> 23:47.137
What I was trying to, interesting in finding it. I 
think the thing you've got to distinguish here is

23:47.677 --> 23:54.826
that a lot of this is connected with the oil 
industry. And in general, I had little or no

23:56.313 --> 24:04.887
contact with the oil industry, other than 
meetings and so on and so forth, occasional

23:56.313 --> 24:04.887
meetings. See, we were pretty much involved in 
synthetic fuels, not oil problems.

24:13.241 --> 24:19.131
Now, I only have one other question from this 
technical oil mission meeting that I couldn't

24:13.241 --> 24:19.131
understand.

24:22.233 --> 24:33.343
And between 45 and 47, there's a sizable amount of 
work to be done, as you point out, in December of 45

24:22.233 --> 24:33.343
until 47 when these reports begin to come out.

24:35.826 --> 24:50.940
I assume that in that period when these mission 
documents were team written for all practical

24:35.826 --> 24:50.940
purposes,

24:35.826 --> 24:50.940
that they must have then is when they must have gone 
through flow records and... Yes, I did. Okay. Then

24:57.340 --> 25:11.562
it's when you went back and looked over... We went 
through the flow records and we went through

24:57.340 --> 25:11.562
laboratory records and we went through 
technology, small scale and large scale, and it

24:57.340 --> 25:11.562
was all written up in these reports. And then the 
reports come out in 47. Did you ever feel called

25:13.565 --> 25:16.269
upon to go back and check these reports? No, I never 
did go back and check. But now other people may

25:18.511 --> 25:20.556
have. Al Miller and his group, he had a group of 
people working with him, and they may have done a

25:22.541 --> 25:31.002
lot of rechecking on this stuff, but I didn't know 
about that.

25:42.473 --> 25:43.114
All right. Now, you say you picked eight 
specialization groups of three to 11 persons, in

25:43.134 --> 25:51.989
effect, go into these plants to look them over. I 
didn't know there were eight groups, but you may be

25:52.910 --> 25:55.815
right. Well, that's what I say here in this paper. I 
don't know whether it's right or not. Probably

26:00.183 --> 26:01.465
reasonably right. All right.

26:08.731 --> 26:13.156
If that's true, then what kind of aid 
specialization groups would you pick? What sort

26:13.176 --> 26:16.420
of specialization groups are they talking about? 
Would this be engineers, chemical engineers,

26:16.460 --> 26:21.166
plant managers? Is that the kind of team you tried 
to put together? What I'm trying to find out is what

26:24.269 --> 26:28.995
sort of team did you put together and did you pick 
on?

26:30.497 --> 26:35.683
Well, it was a very chaotic, and I would say, not 
particularly precise arrangement, we would

26:36.541 --> 27:06.092
generally

26:36.541 --> 27:06.092
try to get maybe one good chemical man and one plant 
man and

26:36.541 --> 27:06.092
perhaps one man who had had a lot of process 
experience to go to a given plant to look the thing

26:36.541 --> 27:06.092
over and begin the preliminary report on it. And we 
would expect that team of maybe three or four or

27:10.962 --> 27:16.547
five people to at least write one report. Now, that 
report was then discussed at meeting of the team

27:17.648 --> 27:36.585
members, and probably from that we might decide 
whether we should go back there and investigate

27:17.648 --> 27:36.585
certain phases of it that weren't covered in the 
first report and so on and so forth. Teams were

27:36.768 --> 27:38.931
scattered all over Europe. Our meetings were 
never on any definite scheduled basis.

27:48.447 --> 27:55.318
When the reports were out, I'm sure that not all the 
team members in Germany had a chance to read it. And

27:56.660 --> 28:01.628
so it was a very loose sort of an arrangement, you 
know. And it might often involve just who was

28:02.300 --> 28:13.013
available in Brussels or London to go on a specific 
mission. I thought that was probably what it was. I

28:15.495 --> 28:31.294
also

28:15.495 --> 28:31.294
suspect that a lot of the team members did not see 
reports that other team members had written until

28:15.495 --> 28:31.294
we were back here in the United States.

28:31.561 --> 28:35.085
Was the fuel and lubricant subcommittee 
controversial?

28:38.730 --> 28:40.012
No, I don't believe so. I don't believe there was 
any question of controversy. Well, there's...

28:45.018 --> 28:46.860
Unless there's some things I missed. You see, part 
of the time I was in the field doing investigations

28:47.501 --> 28:55.611
of the plants and so on and so forth. And at times 
like that, I was not very well aware of what was

28:56.047 --> 29:10.709
happening in London where the central 
organization was trying to function and to send

28:56.047 --> 29:10.709
the teams out and so on and so forth. Who was Dr. T.G. 
Delbridge?

29:15.617 --> 29:19.202
Delbridge was a man from the Atlantic Refining 
Company. And I don't think he went on the missions,

29:19.823 --> 29:22.187
did he? No. He evidently is... But I think 
Delbridge was a very knowledgeable man. He was a

29:28.276 --> 29:29.919
very good technical man. And I think Delbridge 
suggested to us a lot of members from the petroleum

29:30.660 --> 29:39.654
industry that might be useful on these missions. 
He writes a report in August of 1944 for the

29:40.135 --> 29:46.084
Technical Industrial Intelligence Committee 
that seems to give some direction to what you're

29:46.486 --> 29:51.135
looking for in Germany. I wouldn't be surprised. 
He was a considerably older man than I was at that

29:53.299 --> 30:07.988
time, and he knew the industry well, and he knew the 
technology well, and I'm sure that he might well

29:53.299 --> 30:07.988
have written reports about it.
