00:02.680 --> 00:06.733
My company wasn't big, it was just three of us, so it wasn't any big deal.

00:07.203 --> 00:10.327
And I fly the Aggie flag in downtown Midland.

00:10.347 --> 00:14.193
That's my battle cry, which meant they'd take the Supreme Court of the United States before they won.

00:14.653 --> 00:15.154
And I won.

00:15.835 --> 00:19.921
Well, I was pretty proud then, because in a way, excuse me, I was giving those bankers a finger.

00:19.941 --> 00:25.509
The pride is, and maybe it's deeper than that.

00:25.629 --> 00:27.672
Maybe it's deeper that I made that.

00:28.112 --> 00:31.016
It made something out of me I wouldn't have been otherwise.

00:31.377 --> 00:32.759
Better, by golly.

00:33.941 --> 00:37.125
And the friendships, the dead,

00:37.105 --> 00:41.610
Some of my buddies killed in action, others, you know, lived a good life, died.

00:42.671 --> 00:50.561
So I'm far enough along life's road now that you have some, a lot of tenderness, but it was tender back then, you know.

00:50.581 --> 00:52.923
I cried at the final review, you know.

00:53.544 --> 00:55.406
There's somebody in them that makes you cry.

00:55.747 --> 01:01.333
I cried when they were beating my ass.

01:01.473 --> 01:05.458
One of the stories I couldn't let you leave without telling, and I think it's a pretty good story.

01:06.755 --> 01:26.921
In 1984, Randy Mattson and Davis Ford, no, it was Jim Jeter, and he died, the president of the former student, came and sat right there, there was four of them, and they came and they asked me, would I help fund the former student building?

01:26.941 --> 01:31.727
I couldn't imagine a bigger honor for an Aggie to be offered that.

01:32.127 --> 01:34.230
And so I teared up.

01:34.801 --> 01:36.444
Oh, yeah, I couldn't even talk first.

01:37.585 --> 01:42.353
I said, well, yeah.

01:42.413 --> 01:43.374
So oil was $28 a barrel then.

01:45.678 --> 01:48.342
And so two years go by.

01:48.482 --> 01:50.565
I'm in a financial battle with my banks.

01:50.625 --> 01:57.656
The first payments due, I made one payment of half a million dollars like in 86, earlier, late 85.

01:58.157 --> 02:00.100
Then the next big one's due.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.712
I really, I don't have the money.

02:03.673 --> 02:09.704
Right, so finally I sell my biggest company, and one of the reasons I sold it was I sold Clay John.

02:09.764 --> 02:11.867
It was a pretty big sale.

02:11.887 --> 02:16.595
I sold it because then I could get the banks to let me finish paying for that building.

02:18.198 --> 02:24.248
But anyhow, the story is that when the first payment came due, oil was $10 a barrel, and I cried again.

02:25.561 --> 02:27.184
But I'll carry it one step further.

02:27.224 --> 02:31.252
I did sell that building, and Billy Clayton and Davis Ford were very much involved in it.

02:31.712 --> 02:34.958
They had the former student meeting up in Denver.

02:35.539 --> 02:37.924
Oh, excuse me, Colorado City.

02:37.944 --> 02:38.926
So we have the idea.

02:38.946 --> 02:43.775
There'd been quite a bit of bad-mouth, and then they should because I wasn't able to make the payment.

02:43.795 --> 02:47.181
Until I sold that company, I couldn't make the payment.

02:47.448 --> 02:52.774
So there was a little jealousy there, and there was a bad man, so they fed it back to me.

02:53.875 --> 02:57.199
So finally I said, okay, I sold the company, I got the money.

02:57.879 --> 03:00.622
But nobody else knew it, except Davis Ford and Billy Clayton.

03:01.283 --> 03:07.369
So we go up there, and we decided to have a little fun out of that, as Aggies do sometimes.

03:07.390 --> 03:14.517
So they're at the big board meeting, and Billy Clayton said, well, Clayton Williams is up here, and he needs to tell you something.

03:14.537 --> 03:15.278
He's not going to...

03:16.000 --> 03:18.425
Make the payments like three more years.

03:18.445 --> 03:19.306
He's not going to do it.

03:19.346 --> 03:21.771
You can see those guys saying, yeah, see, I told you, sir.

03:22.432 --> 03:25.598
I got up there and said, I'm not going to pay it out over three years.

03:25.618 --> 03:27.622
I'm going to pay the son of a bitch off right now.

03:31.430 --> 03:32.171
So there's that.

03:32.311 --> 03:33.353
I mean, there's competition.

03:33.413 --> 03:34.636
Aggies were just people.

03:35.277 --> 03:36.259
There's competition.

03:36.279 --> 03:37.401
There's jealousies there.

03:37.938 --> 03:47.508
But the heart of it is that the love and affection for A&M is in our heart, and it's there to stay, and it's real.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.792
That's great, isn't it?
