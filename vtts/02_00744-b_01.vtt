WEBVTT

00:01.820 --> 00:09.589
Do you think that had he stayed, he might have had a 
winning record anyway? No, I think he, you see, he

00:10.450 --> 00:25.168
had Crow and most of those good players graduated, 
and I think, oh, I think he's the type of guy that

00:10.450 --> 00:25.168
would have won somewhere, somehow or another, but 
I think he'd have dropped back. He knew it. He was

00:26.049 --> 00:28.232
smart enough to visualize it. Winning here 
consistently wasn't in the books.

00:35.424 --> 00:38.007
Well, then when Myers came in, how did things go 
then? Well, it went pretty good. Jim,

00:42.934 --> 00:55.450
like I say now, Jim was a good assistant coach, but 
he didn't have the charisma for being a head coach.

00:55.470 --> 00:57.493
I think he was a good assistant coach. had a good 
background under Red Saunders. But you see, in

01:01.712 --> 01:06.018
football, that's a pretty big task. And a man has to 
be able to coach, be a head football coach. He has to

01:11.845 --> 01:16.111
be able to visualize everything about it. Because 
our assistant coach over here under Red Saunders,

01:16.131 --> 01:23.079
our assistant coach under Bear Bryant is a 
defensive coach. That wouldn't make me a head

01:23.099 --> 01:25.202
coach, would it? Do you think Bear knew the whole 
game well, that he was that much of an expert? No,

01:29.616 --> 01:33.002
but he was smart enough to find out from other 
people. Then he hired good people to handle each.

01:34.945 --> 01:47.767
Well, and then he, as far as his defenses were 
concerned, he never did put up a defense until he

01:34.945 --> 01:47.767
conferred with Oklahoma coach Bud Wilkinson and 
Jim Tatum of Maryland. Hmm. See? You see, when he

01:51.642 --> 01:55.887
was here, he didn't pass any. See, his whole 
offense has changed since he's been at Alabama. He

02:01.153 --> 02:02.815
didn't like kick field goals either, did he? No. He 
just believed in just blowing in and blowing them

02:03.536 --> 02:07.060
out, and that was it. Three yards and a pile of dust. 
He didn't have really anything in his offense at

02:10.785 --> 02:15.130
all. He didn't pass very little.

02:19.635 --> 02:21.177
But he got the job done.

02:24.532 --> 02:28.818
got the job done.

02:28.838 --> 02:30.099
How long did Myers stay here? Myers stayed here 
about 54, let's see, Bryant left in 57, 58, 59, 60.

02:43.077 --> 02:44.158
And then Fulberg come in? Fulberg came in in 61, 62, 
63.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.682
Stallings came in 65. So you became athletic 
director again when Fulberg came in? No, when he

02:57.027 --> 02:58.469
left. See, I hired Fulberg. He coached down here. 
He was athletic director also? Yeah, also. See,

03:03.194 --> 03:04.976
they wouldn't give me the athletic director job. I 
don't know why, but I didn't make a difference to

03:05.096 --> 03:07.619
me. It was only just an amount of money, but they 
didn't. The only thing that made me feel good about

03:10.182 --> 03:15.868
the whole thing is they hired me twice as athletic 
director. So I must not have been too bad a guy.

03:18.397 --> 03:22.241
Somebody was foolish and didn't know what they 
were doing, I don't know. Well, I think they

03:22.281 --> 03:28.188
probably had to admit that your administration 
had been good, that you'd kept them in the black, so

03:22.281 --> 03:28.188
to speak. Can you think of, during this whole 
period, any major problems you had, financial,

03:29.689 --> 03:36.797
otherwise, or things going pretty good? No, 
things went along fairly good, and we always had a

03:37.117 --> 03:42.463
surplus. And after 52 and 53, I finally, all this 
money that we had went into the fiscal office. And

03:51.507 --> 03:53.610
the fiscal office would take it and loan it out. And 
finally, I talked them into buying us some

03:53.650 --> 04:01.279
government bonds where we could get a little 
interest off of it. But it was our money. They were

04:02.981 --> 04:05.003
administering it, but it was our money. So I talked 
them into buying some government bonds which we

04:06.285 --> 04:11.391
got the interest off of. Now, all the money. It goes 
in there, I put it on time deposit with the fiscal

04:12.869 --> 04:19.600
office, I understand from wallet, and they get 
earnings from it, you see. Mm-hmm. Get interest

04:20.482 --> 04:21.484
from it. Mm-hmm. Were there any plans made at this 
time? Were you making any long-range plans to know

04:26.632 --> 04:30.619
that the stadium was expanded into 6667? Yeah, we 
finally came in with expansion of the stadium.

04:35.087 --> 04:35.808
When was this? Was this planned a long time in 
advance? Well, no, it was...

04:42.333 --> 04:44.996
It was planned after Stallings got there. Okay, 
we'll get to that in a minute then. I was wondering

04:46.318 --> 04:48.841
if you all had any long-range goals? No, what we 
were trying to do, you see, at that time, the

04:49.081 --> 04:53.827
college itself wasn't expanded. Yeah, I know. And 
as far as our home attendance was concerned, we had

04:57.191 --> 05:02.798
a stadium there that sat in a seat about 33. We used 
to put seats around it. 34,000 or 5,000

05:05.081 --> 05:09.707
spectators, and we didn't have anything. in 
demand. Very seldom you ever see them. You always,

05:14.473 --> 05:17.538
on football, you'd rather have too little than too 
many.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.685
Oh, my. And our attendance in those games were 
fair, but there again we had these good teams that

05:22.705 --> 05:34.701
we got money from, like Michigan, Ohio State, LSU, 
and teams like that, which kept us in the black.

05:37.125 --> 05:37.265
Mm-hmm. Hmm. How far ahead do you schedule games? 
Could you tell us a little bit about how you go about

05:41.996 --> 05:44.559
scheduling the game? Well, we usually have an 
athletic director coaches meeting in January

05:44.980 --> 05:58.057
every year at some designated place like New York, 
Chicago, San Francisco. Everybody from all the

05:58.357 --> 06:01.181
NCAA colleges. You get to know those fellas. 
Really? You do. You get to know them pretty well.

06:04.886 --> 06:09.512
And you go up there with your schedule in hand and 
talk to those people. I say, I scheduled Army

06:12.184 --> 06:15.709
twice, because we never had scheduled them. Had 
never played them. Never played them, and that was

06:16.770 --> 06:23.058
one of the dreams of Earl Rudder, to play Army. But I 
don't think he lived to see it. No, he didn't.

06:28.124 --> 06:32.669
And you go up there and you talk to them, just like a 
convention, and you get with them. They have the

06:32.689 --> 06:36.394
athletic director's meetings, and you get with 
them, and you bring your schedule, and Ask them if

06:37.623 --> 06:39.085
they'd like to play you. You just kind of go around 
and buttonhole them then. That's right. And then

06:44.210 --> 06:50.457
you write to them during the year and send them your 
schedule and ask them if they'd be here. It seems

06:51.278 --> 06:54.161
like we go to play these big teams. Is it for some 
reason that at least we never seem to have any

06:54.241 --> 07:00.008
problems scheduling large teams. Do they like to 
play in them on their home turf? Yes. Were we

07:04.273 --> 07:06.415
considered an easy mark or something? Well, 
coaches are a little more what they call

07:06.968 --> 07:14.418
non-conference games. They're a little bit more 
reluctant to play a team if they think they can

07:14.438 --> 07:18.583
beat. I'll put it that way. See, we never have. 
We've played Michigan two or three times. Ohio

07:25.252 --> 07:26.453
State at least twice. Twice. Never have beaten 
them. Played USC, LSU. I think I talked to Marvin

07:32.321 --> 07:36.807
the other day, and they've got Illinois coming in 
here next year. Well, Illinois used to be a

07:37.445 --> 07:39.248
powerhouse. I don't think they are now. And then 
we've got Ole Miss coming in. Well, Clemson used to

07:44.256 --> 07:47.241
be a powerhouse years and years ago. They're not 
anymore. They're sort of a set-up team. And I don't

07:50.006 --> 07:53.652
know anything about the other Kansas that we're 
going to play or Washington. Eight years ago,

07:53.892 --> 07:55.755
Washington was good. And, of course, Jim Owens 
coached in Washington three, four, five years

07:55.775 --> 08:00.303
ago. They had a great team. Mm-hmm. And Kansas had a 
good team last year, but they lost their

08:02.318 --> 08:05.141
quarterback. They'll be just a so-so team. We 
ought to be able to win two out of our three

08:06.762 --> 08:11.146
non-conference games, I think. I think right now 
we're in the best position as far as material-wise

08:11.166 --> 08:18.273
and depth that we've been in since I can remember. 
Well, we might go on now and talk about, say, was

08:20.736 --> 08:28.463
there anything that happened during the Myers era 
that was interesting? No, nothing more. Jim

08:35.393 --> 08:42.561
Jim was, I liked Jim, and we got along fine. And I 
thought he did a fairly good job. Must be a fairly

08:45.264 --> 08:46.406
decent coach. He's still at Dallas. Yeah, well, 
he's an assistant coach. And he's, well, he's

08:51.612 --> 08:54.795
obviously a specialist in one phase of the game. He 
didn't know anything just between us boys. He

08:57.979 --> 09:00.422
didn't know anything about offense or defense 
either. what I could see. I mean, I've had

09:01.593 --> 09:07.500
experience, 15 years of experience, of running 
the whole thing in high school and some part of

09:01.593 --> 09:07.500
colleges. But you can very easily, Jim, he was a 
good line coach. As far as the technical part of

09:15.830 --> 09:21.938
offense and defense, I don't think he was superb. 
He had to depend upon his assistants. And then

09:25.902 --> 09:28.165
Fulberg came in. What'd you think of Fulberg? This 
is the first coach I remember here. Well, Fulberg,

09:33.736 --> 09:35.438
you know, he had been here. I had hired him as a, 
there you go again, you see. I had hired Fulberg in

09:39.823 --> 09:43.767
52 as an end coach. He stayed here one or two years, 
and then went to Florida. Then when he came in one of

09:48.512 --> 09:50.955
them, he hired me again, see. Of course, he made him 
athletic director again, see. I went through that

09:54.859 --> 09:58.303
experience with all these coaches. Well, Fulberg 
was all right there again. I think Fulberg made a

10:00.378 --> 10:04.925
good athletic director. He did stay on one year, 
didn't he? Well, he stayed on from December to

10:09.392 --> 10:14.180
July. He was progressive and he had good ideas and 
everything, but I don't think he was a head coach. I

10:18.607 --> 10:24.877
don't think he had the...

10:18.607 --> 10:24.877
A guy to be a head coach, that's his only job. That's 
a big job.

10:29.317 --> 10:57.737
be what you might call dedicated to that one 
particular job and that's a 24-hour day job he's

10:29.317 --> 10:57.737
got he's called upon for so many other things 
outside of in other words he's a public relation

10:29.317 --> 10:57.737
man and and the head coach and his biggest deal is to 
hire people that know more than he does at

10:29.317 --> 10:57.737
particular positions get what i'm talking about 
the specialists Unless he does, that's, I think,

10:58.510 --> 11:06.970
one of the main reasons why Darrell Waltz has been 
so successful. He hasn't changed his coaches. And

11:09.336 --> 11:14.969
he's had people under him that knew what they were 
doing, and he kept them and paid them. I think

11:14.989 --> 11:15.490
royally.

11:23.232 --> 11:26.016
Of course, you might not agree with being an Aggie, 
but I don't know. I don't see how you can argue with

11:26.036 --> 11:28.459
success, though. Nothing succeeds like success. 
Yeah. You know, watching Fulberg, I always

11:32.645 --> 11:36.931
thought he built some fairly decent defensive 
teams. Well, there again, it was the assistants.

11:41.397 --> 11:43.440
Fulberg, he'd sit up in the stands a lot. I don't 
think Fulberg was actually

11:51.076 --> 11:53.078
interested in head coaching. He was more 
interested in going ahead and being an athletic

11:54.400 --> 11:57.663
director. I see. He didn't want that routine and 
that work that was attached to it. Being a head

12:03.570 --> 12:05.452
coach is a 12-month-a-year job. That's right. But 
he was all right. Like I say again, there you are. I

12:11.338 --> 12:13.821
went through it with good friends and everything. 
But, of course, he was let go. I think Stallings had

12:18.126 --> 12:20.408
a lot to do with that. Who, how did we get Gene 
Stallings? How did? Well, two directors went out

12:25.139 --> 12:30.125
and hired him. I shouldn't say that over the tape. 
He was recommended by Barry Bryant. That's a good

12:36.814 --> 12:37.755
recommendation. That's a good one. You can't go, 
you can't beat that. Yeah. And he was recommended

12:40.198 --> 12:42.441
to two of the board's directors. And of course, 
being a young coach and having a fine background

12:42.461 --> 12:49.129
and being the first assistant at Alabama,

12:52.518 --> 13:00.507
and being an A&M player and a former student and 
everything, it looked like he was, you know, he was

12:52.518 --> 13:00.507
the right man.

13:03.850 --> 13:08.315
And of course he came in here and things, I remember 
that it was an exciting time. Things changed

13:08.375 --> 13:09.857
around, it seemed. Oh yeah, he changed everything 
around. And Gene was a personal friend of mine. I

13:13.601 --> 13:14.842
like him fine. He's got lots on the ball. But some 
people are growing some swell. Hellenfeld told me

13:21.965 --> 13:26.792
he thought that Gene Stallings knew more about 
football than anybody he'd ever met. Well, I

13:27.393 --> 13:30.857
disagree with him. Why should Hellenfeld, the 
contractor... Well, you know, everybody has an

13:30.918 --> 13:38.548
opinion, and sometimes you think you're an expert 
on everything.

13:42.594 --> 13:43.535
Well, I disagree with him. Now, don't get me wrong, 
I think he's a knowledgeable man, but I don't think

13:44.497 --> 13:49.744
he knew more about football than anybody.

13:53.302 --> 13:54.985
Because that's a hard thing to decide. Did he tell 
you that, Sidney? Well, he got very mad about it

13:57.609 --> 14:00.473
when that started. Of course, Mr. Peterson. I got 
that impression. You talked to Peterson? No, I

14:07.263 --> 14:15.977
talked to Mr. Heldenfeld, and I got the impression 
that he really liked Gene Stallings, and that that

14:07.263 --> 14:15.977
was a subject I wasn't to get into with him. That was 
a very sore spot, so I didn't pursue it any further.

14:22.968 --> 14:27.034
Gene would have been here today, and I told him. I 
was athletic director then, and I told him. I did

14:29.857 --> 14:32.221
everything in the world to help Gene. But his 
biggest problem was that he couldn't get along

14:33.803 --> 14:37.127
with the administration. I wasn't aware of that. 
Huh? I wasn't aware of that. I thought maybe he had

14:41.013 --> 14:43.116
more trouble with his boys than he did. No. I 
shouldn't say this, because if he ever reads it,

14:43.516 --> 14:48.343
he'll be on me. But instead, if problems would come 
up, I would recommend to the council what to do. we

14:53.309 --> 14:55.695
wanted to be done as athletic director. Then the 
council would recommend to the president. The

14:59.423 --> 15:00.546
president would OK it. In two or three days, the 
president would call me and say, we're not going to

15:00.626 --> 15:03.533
do it that way. And the reason for it was that Gene 
would go around the president and go to two board

15:03.573 --> 15:09.687
members. And the board members would bring 
pressure on the president. I mean, Rutter didn't

15:12.648 --> 15:13.789
like that. No, sir. I don't imagine he did, no. He'd 
come to me, and I coached Rutter, and he'd come to me

15:16.352 --> 15:22.019
and say, Bones, what were you going to do about that 
boy down there? I said, don't ask me. I said, you

15:22.840 --> 15:26.985
can't do anything with him. You think maybe this, 
because Stallings was a reasonably young man, he

15:27.005 --> 15:31.110
still had something to learn? He sure did. He was a 
good Christian boy and everything, but he just

15:34.174 --> 15:39.280
running roughshod over everybody. And you can't 
run a rough shot over the athletic council and the

15:39.800 --> 15:45.325
president of the institution. You're not going to 
run a rough shot over Earl Rudd. Of course, he was

15:48.668 --> 15:50.810
let... He was...

15:54.253 --> 16:02.240
The Stallings, he was let go in... Seventy... 
That's after Earl's death. Yeah, he was let go

16:02.260 --> 16:04.502
in... Seventy-two. That was his biggest problem. 
And Earl didn't like it. I'm going to tell you

16:08.403 --> 16:14.289
something that President Williams told me. He 
told me that when Earl, when he came here as

16:14.309 --> 16:24.380
president of this institution, and Stallings 
went to him and told him and said, Mr. Williams, I'm

16:14.309 --> 16:24.380
glad that you're here, but you're not my boss. Now, 
the president told me that with his own mouth. Now,

16:30.287 --> 16:31.108
what would you do? That goes right back to the thing 
I said. He couldn't get along with

16:34.752 --> 16:36.874
administrations. They called me out there after I 
retired. Mr. Butler, D. Butler was the chairman of

16:42.109 --> 16:45.193
the Athletic Council. He said, what is the duties 
of the Athletic Council? I said, you can just look

16:48.637 --> 16:51.661
in the rule book there at Southwest Conference. 
You can see what the rules are. I said, they have

16:53.664 --> 17:06.540
direct supervision over all activities of the 
athletic department, including the budgetary

16:53.664 --> 17:06.540
and all other rules and regulations that are set up 
that are passed on to the president for approval.

17:19.565 --> 17:20.186
He called me out. He didn't want to know what the 
athletic council had to do with him. And I said,

17:23.490 --> 17:26.713
well, he's there, your boss. He just laughed at me 
and told me, hey, don't know. I said, I'm a dean. I'm

17:29.957 --> 17:32.480
not responsible to anybody around me except for 
the board. Now, that was the reason. I don't know

17:37.606 --> 17:38.828
whether that's going on tape. That's up to you. I 
wouldn't put that on tape. But that's a true story.

17:44.995 --> 17:45.656
That's interesting. I'm glad to know that. And 
that's the reason Chris Gronman left here. He's

17:49.788 --> 17:56.035
just one of the reasons they wouldn't take him off 
the council. And he just decided he had to. And, oh,

17:58.517 --> 18:00.099
yeah, fine fellow. Great personality, and I'm 
still a good friend of his. Why should a fellow

18:04.844 --> 18:09.729
just, like I said a while ago, some people grow and 
some swell? He'd still be at A&M. The Helen fellow

18:12.172 --> 18:13.493
didn't know that. Maybe that's a little bit of 
immaturity on his part, something he'll outgrow.

18:18.104 --> 18:20.227
Well, I imagine he's not telling the Lankers what 
to do. Oh, I don't imagine so. He wouldn't tell

18:22.369 --> 18:25.172
Brian what to do. I wouldn't put that in the script, 
so if you... That's between me and you. That ought

18:29.558 --> 18:37.607
to be...

18:29.558 --> 18:37.607
Do you know anything about Ballard's hiring, the 
selection? The president hired him. President

18:40.170 --> 18:41.252
Williams hired him? He did all the searching 
himself? Yeah. He got Bud Wilkinson...

18:49.593 --> 18:52.257
to be, what do you mean, consultant? Yeah, that's a 
good enough term. Consultant. To go out and

18:56.484 --> 18:59.047
recommend somebody to him. And of course he picked 
a good man to be. That's right. Was Bud Wilkerson

19:05.357 --> 19:07.701
ever interviewed for a job here? No, I don't think 
so. Of course he had thumbs down on it because he had

19:10.485 --> 19:17.676
a bird nest on the ground up in Oklahoma. And he's 
got a good one in television, too. That's right.

19:21.299 --> 19:25.524
But Dr. Williams, I remember hearing him say that 
he was going to pick the coach this time. That's

19:26.845 --> 19:27.386
interesting.

19:31.290 --> 19:32.792
I know there were a lot of rumors flying then. I was 
in the service, and there was a rumor in the paper

19:32.832 --> 19:39.460
they'd offered Charlie McClendon down there a 
million dollars. Well, that's right. Now, there

19:40.541 --> 19:42.683
again, the board got into that. Now, this is his 
hearsay now. I'm going to tell you this story.

19:51.608 --> 19:59.978
retired now, he had coached Charlie McKinnon in 
some junior high school at some small college in

19:51.608 --> 19:59.978
Arkansas, and he was pretty close to Charlie. And I 
understand that he and two of the board members

20:00.559 --> 20:03.282
flew out. Now this is hearsay. Hearsay, yeah. 
There's no factual evidence on this. They flew out

20:08.468 --> 20:16.558
to California to make this offer to Charlie, and 
Charlie wouldn't accept it because he had a bowl

20:08.468 --> 20:16.558
game coming up.

20:20.422 --> 20:21.143
That is interesting. So I think Emery was the 
choice of the administration. Have you had a

20:27.124 --> 20:29.806
chance to watch any of his performances? Do you 
think he's going to make a pretty good coach? I

20:32.188 --> 20:34.731
think Emery's a very- Seems personable. Very 
personable person, but I'm very on the farm 100%. I

20:40.096 --> 20:43.799
belong to the Aggie Club and the Century Club, and I 
support everything at A&M. And the quarterback

20:43.819 --> 20:47.923
club, I do my share. There again, I'm just telling 
you this, he better have a scoreboard in his face.

20:52.693 --> 20:54.897
Oh, I think, and he may be foolish. I hope Emory 
stays here for 100 years, because I like him. I'm

20:58.322 --> 20:59.463
for him 100%. But if he comes up next year with a 
fourth season, some of these book members will be

21:00.445 --> 21:08.557
after him. You see, a board member, he's succeeded 
in his profession. He thinks he's a success. And he

21:17.603 --> 21:21.968
can't tolerate failure. Yes, I've run into that. I 
know exactly what you mean. He can't tolerate

21:28.555 --> 21:32.139
failure. Well, maybe then the board has become too 
ingrown. In other words, we've got too many Aggies

21:36.264 --> 21:38.946
on the board. I think that Mr. Emory, like I said, I 
hope he stays there forever. And I think he's doing

21:46.190 --> 21:48.093
a good job. And he's been given everything 
possible to do it with. I mean, I can't say we didn't

21:52.880 --> 21:56.786
give him this or gave him that. But there's still 
some board members on there that will not tolerate

21:56.806 --> 22:04.477
defeat. Oh, well, I'm well aware of people. I can 
name them to you, but I'm not going to do it. Well,

22:10.245 --> 22:14.712
that's maybe how they became successful, and 
that's the way they are, that they... They drive

22:15.147 --> 22:18.270
themselves and they drive everybody else like 
they drive themselves. But when you get success,

22:18.751 --> 22:28.101
it's not that you have been successful. They get 
what they call smart. It's not altogether your

22:32.105 --> 22:39.232
brains or your skill or anything, but anybody 
that's made success in the world, he's had

22:32.105 --> 22:39.232
somebody to help him. I don't care who you are. Even 
the President of the United States, he's had to

22:43.902 --> 22:45.565
with thousands of people helping him. And you 
can't succeed without the help of other people.

22:48.529 --> 22:54.038
And like I said before, you've got to be at the right 
place at the right time and the right people

22:48.529 --> 22:54.038
pulling for you, even in your job. You ought to take 
over Lindsay's job one of these days. No, I'm in the

22:58.985 --> 23:01.009
library. You're out of that, aren't you? We're 
just trying to be everybody's friend and find out

23:04.153 --> 23:07.018
what we can. Did you take journalism here? No, no, 
I'm a historian. Oh, well, maybe you can help me

23:12.117 --> 23:13.920
with my history. Well, if I can, I'd be glad to. You 
know Charles Crawford? Do you know Professor

23:17.625 --> 23:18.887
Crawford? Gosh, well, he's in the Rotary Club with 
me. Well, Charlie Crawford is up there in the

23:20.469 --> 23:24.735
archives, and that's where he writes. He's 
writing the history of the engineering

23:24.916 --> 23:26.898
department. And he's been up there for years. Of 
course, mine will be a little bit different.

23:32.807 --> 23:41.820
Because mine will be sort of a background on my 
family, which I want to put in my life, which has

23:32.807 --> 23:41.820
been interesting. Do you think that retiring in 67 
as you went out with the Southwest Conference

23:42.577 --> 23:52.527
Championship, that was a good time to retire, to go 
out on a good note there? Yes, it was. I hadn't quite

23:54.249 --> 23:59.955
reached 65 when Mr. Ruddard told me I could stay 
here as long as I wanted to. But I'll be frank with

23:59.975 --> 24:08.124
you, I had other things I wanted to do. And I was in a 
position to where I didn't have to have a job.

24:12.766 --> 24:15.069
That's a good position to be in. And secondly, 
although Gene was a very personal friend of mine

24:15.850 --> 24:21.796
and everything, I just got fed up with it. I mean, 
just being knocked around and one thing or

24:23.939 --> 24:27.503
another. I wasn't proud, but I had pride. 
Certainly. And I was positioned where I didn't

24:34.331 --> 24:37.074
have to. I'm not a rich man, but I'm comfortably 
fixed. I am. I am. A couple little dumb questions.

24:42.153 --> 24:47.880
They may not mean anything, but I've always 
wondered about who chooses the uniforms that they

24:42.153 --> 24:47.880
wear. We change uniforms every few years, and I've 
always wondered what. Coaches. Every coach that

24:52.525 --> 24:59.874
comes in here just wipes out all equipment, and 
they start in again with their own design. Because

25:00.355 --> 25:04.900
it seemed like when Gene Stallings came back, we 
went back to sort of the Bear Bryant style again.

25:05.621 --> 25:10.426
Yeah, the prettiest uniforms I ever had here was 
when I came here as a freshman. They hadn't. gray

25:11.930 --> 25:32.754
uniform with maroon stripes around it, and 
blended in with a, I like that, that was mine, but

25:11.930 --> 25:32.754
Harris changed it, Myers changed it, Fulberg, 
see, Fulberg changed it, and Emory changed it,

25:11.930 --> 25:32.754
Gene's changed it. See, I've been here under every 
coach since Bible. Except Norton, I could have

25:36.466 --> 25:45.216
been here under him, so I got a pretty good 
surveillance of different coaches. I just

25:45.236 --> 25:46.017
wondered that. It seemed like every time we got a 
new coach, here came new uniforms and everything.

25:49.502 --> 25:50.022
That's right. Coaches do that. And what 
significance it has to the winning of the ball

25:52.345 --> 25:55.829
games, I don't know. Of course, our colors are 
maroon and white, and I've always thought that

25:56.210 --> 26:05.781
just plain uniforms, a maroon jersey with white 
numbers, with white pants, with It was very

26:06.284 --> 26:10.148
conservative and very pretty. But when you start 
putting in all this other stuff, that's high

26:10.168 --> 26:12.891
school stuff. Yeah, I noticed. Now we go to the 
stripes down the shoulders. I just, I don't know.

26:20.259 --> 26:22.842
It's a coach's prerogative. And change from, say, 
the maroon helmets to the white helmets now.

26:31.391 --> 26:32.612
I'd always wondered about that. Well, you must 
know my friend out there. What's his name? A

26:35.692 --> 26:36.493
historian. He's a dean now. What's his name? A 
young fella. He used to be a historian. Haskell

26:42.782 --> 26:43.483
Monroe. Yeah, Haskell. Yes, I do. Is he still 
studying history? He's a busy man. He's a vice

26:48.290 --> 26:50.413
president of the university now. He used to be a 
swiner. I used to know him for years. He's a good

26:54.659 --> 26:55.881
history pro. He's a very, very, a man of a lot of 
abilities, I imagine. Yeah. He teaches, I think,

27:02.596 --> 27:07.962
one history course now, and the rest of his time is 
in Old South, I believe. And I think most of his time

27:08.763 --> 27:11.626
is now wound up in administration. He works under 
Dr. Calhoun. They say now that Calhoun runs the

27:17.332 --> 27:19.874
school. Is that right? The man of great influence, 
let's say. He has a very responsible job. You

27:27.803 --> 27:28.644
haven't got the thing on. Yeah, I've got it on. I can 
turn it off. There.
