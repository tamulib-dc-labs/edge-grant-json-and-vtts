WEBVTT

00:01.870 --> 00:23.709
Well, I'd just say I'm glad to have you here, and I'm awful glad you're doing this work.

00:24.170 --> 00:24.891
Thank you much.

00:30.507 --> 00:42.913
As we began, let's learn more about your parents, because they were certainly pillars of the A&M community for a long time.

00:43.990 --> 00:46.052
give us a biography of your parents.

00:46.092 --> 00:49.776
Where did they grow up and their experience before coming here?

00:49.796 --> 00:56.582
Well, my father grew up in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, attended Davidson College.

00:58.604 --> 01:05.932
Then I worked at the Blue Ridge Assembly in Black Mountain for a couple of years.

01:07.593 --> 01:09.255
And then

01:10.585 --> 01:19.919
I went to work at Clemson as an assistant in the YMCA, and then joined the U.S.

01:20.159 --> 01:24.185
Army as a Y member.

01:24.486 --> 01:40.069
I mean, it was kind of like Red Cross, except it was the Y. I served in France with the American Army in World War I, and then joined the British Army under the same capacity, and went to the Sudan in Africa.

01:40.977 --> 01:49.030
and then came back to the United States and took a job as head of the Y at Austin College in Sherman.

01:50.107 --> 02:18.763
My mother was raised in Wills Point, Texas and through a friend of hers in Sherman, she was introduced and mom and dad married, went back to Blue Ridge, North Carolina on her honeymoon and came back and worked at Sherman for a little while and then they came to A&M

02:19.553 --> 02:24.259
to be head of the Y about 1924.

02:27.302 --> 02:30.966
I can't tell you the exact date, but sometime during that year.

02:32.088 --> 02:35.912
How long had they been at Austin College?

02:37.354 --> 02:38.595
I don't know the answer to that.

02:41.198 --> 02:42.540
It was several years.

02:43.212 --> 02:47.096
because, as you mentioned, that athletic field up there was named for him.

02:47.797 --> 02:49.979
But I really can't tell you how long they were there.

02:51.401 --> 02:55.746
And you failed to mention their denominational affiliation.

02:56.427 --> 02:58.729
Of the Presbyterian Church.

02:58.849 --> 03:01.652
My mother was raised in the Church of Christ.

03:03.074 --> 03:05.997
And, of course, Daddy was raised...

03:06.905 --> 03:12.510
in the Presbyterian Church, although in North Carolina they call it something else.

03:12.691 --> 03:26.925
But then when they came down here, Daddy was affiliated with the Union Sunday School on the campus and was part of the early group with the A&M Presbyterian Church.

03:28.206 --> 03:36.574
Share any recollections you can about any feelings they had about

03:36.807 --> 03:47.381
as they got here, how they felt about A&M at that time, where they lived, how well they were received, and so forth.

03:47.401 --> 03:58.896
Well, of course, I don't really, I mean, I wasn't born then, and I don't know that I ever heard many conversations about that.

03:58.996 --> 04:06.105
I do remember mother talking about the fact that Mrs. Walton was one of the first people that she ever met.

04:07.115 --> 04:12.682
and she met Mrs. Walden's daughter, Ethel, who later became my mother-in-law.

04:16.207 --> 04:33.409
They moved into the house across the street from the hospital, between the hospital and Dr. Marsh's house, and I remember them talking about activities with other

04:34.132 --> 04:44.851
members of the A&M faculty that they were friends with, the Sherwoods, the Gammons, people like that.

04:48.538 --> 04:54.648
But other than when I came along, I don't know anything about the early time.

04:55.370 --> 04:58.435
You never heard them mention about

04:58.870 --> 05:01.113
people being cool and not receiving?

05:01.193 --> 05:02.134
No, not really.

05:03.455 --> 05:12.726
I just remember some conversation about they were glad to be here and they enjoyed the staff.

05:12.746 --> 05:19.134
Of course, at that time, A&M was pretty isolated compared to anybody else, so the staff was pretty close to each other.

05:20.455 --> 05:26.042
And the house where they moved that you've already mentioned,

05:26.360 --> 05:29.204
Is that the house that your family lived in for a long time?

05:29.224 --> 05:29.945
Yes, it is.

05:30.126 --> 05:31.748
Please describe that house.

05:31.768 --> 05:50.697
Well, that house was a large frame house, had a front porch and we had a separate garage out at the side, but it had three bedrooms and a kitchen and a big living room and a back screen porch.

05:51.757 --> 06:01.428
In 1938, 39, whenever it was, they decided that all the faculty had to move off the campus.

06:01.468 --> 06:05.752
They offered anybody that was living in a house the opportunity to buy it.

06:06.493 --> 06:09.356
And as I recall, Daddy paid $1,200 for it.

06:10.257 --> 06:12.260
I'm not sure of that, but I think that's right.

06:13.501 --> 06:19.047
And the house was moved off the campus, although it was a very, very wet year.

06:19.718 --> 06:23.423
And it took an awful long time to move that house.

06:23.443 --> 06:31.393
But they finally got it moved over on Timber Street at the corner of Timber and Anna.

06:32.555 --> 06:37.301
And we stayed at another house on the campus in the meantime.

06:37.361 --> 06:47.234
And then when that house was finished while we moved down there and lived down there until we moved up on the campus when mother was hostess to the board of directors.

06:48.756 --> 06:49.557
You were born what year?

06:49.857 --> 06:50.297
1931.

06:50.518 --> 06:53.701
So you and I are about the same age.

06:54.041 --> 06:55.083
March 18 for me.

06:55.643 --> 06:56.504
November 10.

06:59.627 --> 07:04.152
Have you heard any family stories about your birth and so forth?

07:04.733 --> 07:11.900
No, not really, except Dr. Marsh said that when he used to go into the hospital, I might as well stay.

07:11.980 --> 07:13.502
Mama might as well stay at home.

07:14.309 --> 07:27.456
And as I recall, I was about to come along, and they hollered at Dr. Marsh at his house, and he came over to the house, and I don't know what time I was born.

07:27.756 --> 07:29.139
That's about all I know about it.

07:29.440 --> 07:30.201
And you're the oldest?

07:30.482 --> 07:31.604
I'm the youngest.

07:31.624 --> 07:32.486
Oh, you're the youngest?

07:32.646 --> 07:33.448
I'm younger.

07:33.468 --> 07:34.550
Jim's older.

07:34.610 --> 07:36.013
So just two boys?

07:37.343 --> 07:40.047
That's correct.

07:40.067 --> 07:47.137
I've heard from someone else that if Dr. Marsh brought the nurse along, it cost the family $5 more.

07:47.377 --> 07:50.381
I don't know about that.

07:52.724 --> 07:58.092
Of course, the two nurses that we knew so well over there were Mom Cleghorn and Ms.

07:58.232 --> 08:04.060
Irene Vaughn, and they both spent a lot of time at our house.

08:04.495 --> 08:10.804
Those two nurses and Dr. Marsh were the medical staff for the entire campus.

08:10.824 --> 08:11.365
Is that right?

08:11.385 --> 08:12.266
Basically, yes.

08:12.927 --> 08:20.539
So if a young man broke a thumb or got a cut or something like that.

08:20.839 --> 08:21.280
Whatever.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.221
He went over.

08:23.423 --> 08:27.329
And did the health facility have a nickname yet?

08:27.809 --> 08:28.771
Not that I know of.

08:28.791 --> 08:29.572
It wasn't the quack shop?

08:29.592 --> 08:30.573
No, I don't think so.

08:32.056 --> 08:33.017
Describe Dr. Marsh.

08:33.942 --> 08:40.610
Dr. Marsh was a very energetic person who loved the outdoors.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.592
He loved to go to the coast and go fishing.

08:44.475 --> 08:48.199
He also kept a whole bunch of dogs out there that they used to hunt with.

08:48.219 --> 08:54.687
Dr. Marsh was very, I'd call him proper and prompt.

08:56.269 --> 09:03.898
One of the things I remember about Dr. Marsh, he had a great big desk in an office at home and he always had Juicy Fruit chewing gum.

09:04.823 --> 09:05.444
Ms.

09:05.504 --> 09:15.094
Marsh was a good cook and always had, she used to make some taffy that we'd go there and pull and she'd give us those mints.

09:15.114 --> 09:21.821
But both of them were very good neighbors and good friends and I'm still friends with the kids.

09:23.063 --> 09:29.970
So as you are growing up as a little boy, describe what it was like to grow up on that campus.

09:30.794 --> 09:34.378
Well, as a little boy, I kind of had to run to the campus.

09:34.418 --> 09:39.063
You couldn't go anywhere other than the campus, and I'd take off and go nearly anywhere.

09:42.606 --> 09:50.655
Invariably, I'd end up over at the hospital because Miss Vaughn would give me a bottle of grape juice, and I just thought grape juice was wonderful.

09:51.536 --> 09:57.342
So she'd give me some grape juice over there, and if I got a cut or a scrape or something,

09:57.862 --> 09:59.525
It never occurred to me to go home.

09:59.605 --> 10:00.346
I'd go see Ms.

10:00.366 --> 10:00.747
Vaughn.

10:01.889 --> 10:03.912
But I used to wander around the campus.

10:05.895 --> 10:18.796
I can remember going out and watching the old field artillery because they had some little bitty contraptions that shot a metal ball about the size of a jawbreaker.

10:19.397 --> 10:24.325
And that's what they learned to aim their sights with.

10:24.963 --> 10:35.318
I remember the fireman's training school, which used to be on the campus, and they'd put ladders up and hold them with ropes and climb ladders and do all that sort of thing.

10:36.680 --> 10:41.486
I used to go watch them march into chow all the time, just because it was fun to go up there.

10:43.029 --> 10:52.422
I didn't think anything at all of walking to the Y from the house, even as a little bitty youngster.

10:52.722 --> 11:04.217
because I'd get to the Y and Daddy would be there and I might play some pool or at one time go for a swim or

11:05.092 --> 11:20.268
whatever else we might do at the Y. And then at night I'm very likely to go to the assembly hall which was the picture show and I could go any night except Thursday night because Thursday night was benefit night and that cost 25 cents.

11:21.829 --> 11:33.141
And I never could go for benefit night because I never could pay the 25 cents but I used to go to the assembly hall and

11:33.678 --> 11:38.044
There was a peanut concession that was run by the Y, and some student would have that.

11:38.926 --> 11:55.450
There was a little shack over by Pop Warner's hamburger stand behind the exchange store, and this is where they roasted the peanuts, and they'd carry them over there, sell them during the movies, but during the daytime they just left a box of peanuts there, and anybody that wanted them came along and threw a dime in the box.

11:56.493 --> 12:02.804
And I didn't have a dime to buy any, so I'd pick one up off the floor before the show and throw it at somebody.

12:03.726 --> 12:06.671
And they'd throw a whole bunch of peanuts back, of course.

12:07.392 --> 12:13.903
And I'd pick all them up and put them in my pocket except one, and I'd throw the one back and get some more thrown at me.

12:14.685 --> 12:18.231
And by the time the show started, well, I'd have two pockets full of peanuts.

12:19.628 --> 12:33.227
As you are a little boy, elementary or younger, who were your closest buddies and what did you all do as young boys?

12:33.367 --> 12:37.092
Well, and of course in the summertime, P.L.

12:37.132 --> 12:45.163
Downs Natatorium opened at three o'clock and I had taken that from one to three and finally got to where I could get up

12:45.987 --> 12:50.693
so I could be there at three o'clock because it was always a fight to see who was the first one in the pool.

12:52.255 --> 13:07.894
And there are lots of, generally I played with older people because there were more people my brother's age than there were my age and so I'd either play or sit and watch but people like

13:08.920 --> 13:21.141
Wally Anderson, the Tabors, the Gammons, Louise and Jack Marsh.

13:33.457 --> 13:39.784
There were some other kids that lived down the street, but I can't tell you what all the names were.

13:40.065 --> 13:43.308
Did y'all ever attempt any pranks?

13:44.490 --> 13:45.651
Oh, we pulled a few pranks.

13:45.671 --> 13:56.103
We used to stand out in the street, particularly in front of Dr. Marsh's house, and play like we had a rope, pulling on that.

13:57.966 --> 14:00.088
I'm accused of turning...

14:00.693 --> 14:12.520
The power plant railroad track used to run down across the end of the street, and I'm accused of turning the engine over by stacking rocks on the track.

14:12.600 --> 14:15.647
I don't know whether I really did that or not, but the engine did turn over.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.764
after I'd been playing on the track.

14:19.465 --> 14:21.307
This is the engine to bring coal?

14:21.387 --> 14:23.008
Coal to the power plant.

14:23.449 --> 14:25.991
That was before they went to a gas-fired plant.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.613
They used to haul coal over there.

14:31.077 --> 14:32.698
I've been known to pull a prank or two.

14:33.799 --> 14:39.265
Were there any areas of the campus that were forbidden for a young boy?

14:39.285 --> 14:40.466
No, I don't think so.

14:41.027 --> 14:46.512
We didn't travel west of the railroad tracks much.

14:47.335 --> 14:57.870
because there wasn't much out there with the exception of the old fish tank, the Y cabin that used to be out there.

14:58.091 --> 15:01.596
I used to go out there a whole lot which is where the old zoo was.

15:05.121 --> 15:14.575
But I generally went out there with my daddy and I think about the only thing that I wasn't really supposed to do was go and

15:15.348 --> 15:18.052
the dormitories or go in the buildings.

15:18.412 --> 15:24.361
And other than the Y, I don't ever remember going in any of the buildings much except the ME shops.

15:24.421 --> 15:28.527
It was always fascinating to go in the shops and watch what they did.

15:30.670 --> 15:34.836
As a first grader, where was the school when you entered the first grade?

15:34.856 --> 15:37.980
When I entered the first grade, the school was

15:41.875 --> 15:59.115
Actually, very close to where Dorm One was, that old building is an old stucco building across from what was called The Corner, which was one of the places put in to take care of the service people during the war.

16:00.337 --> 16:06.344
And it's basically a block east of the Colas building.

16:06.364 --> 16:09.908
And do you remember about how many first graders were there?

16:10.462 --> 16:14.992
Well, there were two sections of first grade.

16:15.854 --> 16:18.619
One was Mrs. Sloop's class, which I was in.

16:18.660 --> 16:21.085
No, I wasn't in Mrs. Sloop's class.

16:21.185 --> 16:22.969
I was in Mrs. Brownlee's class.

16:23.730 --> 16:26.817
But Mrs. Brownlee had one section and Mrs. Sloop had another.

16:27.607 --> 16:37.799
And at that time Miss Sloop had a new teaching method having to do with spelling that she had and it was just being tried in her class.

16:37.879 --> 16:44.247
But there were two sections and I'd say there were probably 40 students in the two sections.

16:44.267 --> 16:48.032
Of those students, about how many were from the country?

16:53.518 --> 16:56.702
I don't know, I would say roughly a fourth.

16:57.307 --> 17:02.993
So most of the youngsters were from the community that today we would call College Station.

17:03.013 --> 17:03.353
Yes.

17:05.015 --> 17:14.805
I've heard some people say that the phrase in that era was that people, you lived out at college instead of College Station.

17:14.825 --> 17:15.185
Yes.

17:15.666 --> 17:17.087
Okay.

17:17.107 --> 17:19.690
I remember that expression a whole lot.

17:19.710 --> 17:24.815
And it was a long way to Bryan.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.077
Well, it was five miles down a two-lane

17:27.530 --> 17:32.014
And of course, in the early days, they had the trolley.

17:33.075 --> 17:40.863
And then they used to have a bus that left the Y and circled by the corner and then ran to Brian.

17:41.504 --> 17:43.586
But the last bus was at 12 o'clock.

17:43.666 --> 17:45.208
And if you missed that, you had to walk.

17:45.708 --> 17:46.589
12 o'clock midnight.

17:46.609 --> 17:47.570
Right.

17:47.590 --> 17:49.852
Now, was there a trolley during your memory?

17:50.993 --> 17:52.795
I really don't remember the trolley.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.702
I presume it ran on the railroad track?

17:55.722 --> 17:57.945
No, it ran on a railroad track.

17:58.305 --> 17:58.926
Not the railroad track.

17:58.946 --> 18:00.167
Not the railroad track.

18:00.208 --> 18:04.112
You can still see some evidences of the trolley.

18:05.674 --> 18:19.269
If you go down 29th Street, I'm not sure what street that is, but about halfway between Coulter and downtown, there's a street that turns through there, and you can see some of the old tracks.

18:22.112 --> 18:22.933
Oh, good.

18:23.369 --> 18:29.377
The space between college and Bryan was just- Vacant land.

18:29.397 --> 18:30.138
Vacant land.

18:30.158 --> 18:32.361
Yeah.

18:32.741 --> 18:37.307
And how often did your family go all the way to Bryan?

18:38.989 --> 18:41.252
We might go once every three or four weeks.

18:42.474 --> 18:47.520
Where did your mom buy groceries?

18:49.812 --> 19:15.066
I don't know whether you call it a co-op store or what it was, but there was a store located in the red brick building directly in front of the old exchange store, and you could go in there and buy groceries.

19:16.107 --> 19:18.110
Was that available to off-campus families?

19:18.290 --> 19:19.532
I don't know the answer to that.

19:19.732 --> 19:22.996
I really don't.

19:23.056 --> 19:28.423
In your early memories, most of the faculty lived on campus?

19:28.443 --> 19:29.164
Yes, they do.

19:29.805 --> 19:33.910
And the professional staff, I presume, also?

19:35.692 --> 19:39.678
I don't know much of the professional staff did.

19:39.738 --> 19:44.023
How much of it, what percentage that was, I really don't know.

19:45.665 --> 19:47.848
Back to the school.

19:49.010 --> 19:51.473
You all had playgrounds and all that.

19:53.495 --> 19:54.517
Well, not exactly.

19:54.557 --> 19:59.382
We just had some vacant land out there and we could do what we wanted to on it.

20:00.704 --> 20:06.191
And when did you, you attended classes on campus until what grade?

20:06.671 --> 20:13.259
I moved off, we moved to the consolidated school during my second year in school.

20:14.581 --> 20:18.105
So that'd be 38.

20:19.807 --> 20:26.668
because Henry Gilchrist has told me when they came in 37, he remembered talk about the new school building across Jersey.

20:26.889 --> 20:30.580
What was your reaction to that?

20:30.901 --> 20:32.145
Did that seem like a big deal?

20:32.260 --> 20:33.702
Oh, it seemed like a big thing.

20:33.802 --> 20:45.577
I thought that was a big fancy place, and I didn't understand all of it going that way, but that seemed like an awful fancy place.

20:45.637 --> 20:52.626
We had a nice school, and they built a high school, and it just seemed like it was a great big school to me.

20:54.769 --> 21:01.558
Mr. Gilchrist also mentioned about the incorporation of the city

21:02.197 --> 21:04.922
municipality of College Station.

21:04.942 --> 21:08.227
Did your dad have any part in that?

21:08.247 --> 21:09.790
I don't know about the incorporation.

21:09.830 --> 21:14.238
My daddy was the treasurer to buy the land for a consolidated school.

21:15.139 --> 21:15.480
Oh, really?

21:15.500 --> 21:27.040
Yeah, and found some papers one time about him accumulating money to buy the land to put the school on.

21:27.712 --> 21:31.075
College Station was incorporated, I believe, in 1938.

21:33.297 --> 21:37.561
And my wife's father had something to do with that.

21:38.442 --> 21:41.765
But I don't know whether Daddy ever worked on the city part or not.

21:41.865 --> 21:45.829
I don't ever remember him being particularly involved in the city.

21:46.670 --> 21:54.917
Mr. Gilchrist remembered that what stimulated everybody to move was Travis Bryan Sr.'

21:54.897 --> 21:55.778
's plan

21:56.821 --> 22:24.921
that Brian would annex college and that he said that his dad and some of the other people on the faculty didn't want that to happen so they got busy to try to incorporate and the reason for the city limit being where it is there near Hensel Park was that there was a geographic limit as to how far one annexation could go horizontally and that was the limit and by the time that

22:26.352 --> 22:32.419
It could have been extended a second time they had already incorporated.

22:32.439 --> 22:38.766
Have you ever heard any stories about how the name College Station came to be?

22:39.307 --> 22:42.570
Well, the stories I've heard I presume to be true.

22:42.610 --> 22:53.102
There used to be several trains that came through because that was the principal way of getting here, and the porter

22:53.723 --> 23:03.274
which would always call out the name of the town, as he went through the train, as it approached the station, would say, College Station.

23:03.335 --> 23:07.259
And that's where College Station came from.

23:07.900 --> 23:12.245
Was the mailing address before incorporated?

23:14.368 --> 23:15.870
Do you remember what?

23:15.890 --> 23:17.031
I don't know the answer to that.

23:17.551 --> 23:18.633
Because there was a post office.

23:18.773 --> 23:20.095
Yes, there was a post office.

23:20.135 --> 23:24.682
It was in the academic building on the first floor.

23:27.647 --> 23:29.430
That's the first post office I remember.

23:30.091 --> 23:32.895
We're still in these elementary years.

23:33.496 --> 23:44.453
Were there any establishments within access for you on foot or on bicycle that you as a youngster were prohibited from interviewing?

23:45.597 --> 23:48.982
I don't remember any that I was prohibited.

23:50.524 --> 23:51.806
I'm talking about by your parents.

23:51.826 --> 23:54.891
Yeah, I don't remember any that were prohibited.

23:56.293 --> 24:04.486
The Northgate Sparks Pharmacy was there.

24:06.348 --> 24:10.795
Lipscomb's Pharmacy came in a little later.

24:12.867 --> 24:23.518
Mr. Casey was there, but I don't remember any place that my folks told me I couldn't go.

24:24.759 --> 24:27.942
Now, when does Hard Liquors become?

24:27.962 --> 24:29.083
I don't know what year.

24:29.523 --> 24:40.174
Hard Liquors, I guess, had been in business a good while, and I don't ever remember

24:41.302 --> 24:45.308
mother or daddy telling me not to go there, but I knew I wasn't supposed to be there.

24:46.390 --> 24:47.171
He sold beer.

24:47.832 --> 24:48.072
Yeah.

24:49.494 --> 24:53.460
But he did not cheat the law and try to sell it.

24:53.480 --> 24:57.266
Not that I knew of, uh-uh.

24:57.286 --> 25:07.461
Were there any other places of comparative easy access to the campus before World War II where beer was sold?

25:10.124 --> 25:11.385
Not that I remember.

25:17.232 --> 25:35.693
As we're getting up close, moving on up chronologically toward the war, what first world events do you remember as a youngster hearing about on the radio and so forth that later would become a serious part of all our lives?

25:39.453 --> 25:46.822
I guess the start of World War II is one of the earliest things I ever remember.

25:50.926 --> 25:55.091
That I have a good recollection of that day and what happened.

25:56.813 --> 25:58.175
I remember that very well.

26:04.021 --> 26:05.443
I don't know.

26:07.550 --> 26:13.678
I remember when President Roosevelt visited the university.

26:14.218 --> 26:18.244
Oh, describe your recollection of that.

26:18.364 --> 26:33.523
I don't know what year that was, but Dr. Walton was president and President Roosevelt came and he and Dr. Walton rode around a track in Kyle Field.

26:34.752 --> 26:37.816
But I can't tell you exactly what year that was.

26:38.336 --> 26:39.257
Was the war underway?

26:39.578 --> 26:40.339
I don't think so.

26:41.020 --> 26:42.261
I think it was before the war.

26:43.202 --> 26:51.712
Do you remember any impression that President Roosevelt made on your... Oh, I just thought it was real interesting that somebody that big would come to College Station.

26:51.732 --> 26:57.199
Were there other celebrities of those pre-war years you remember?

27:02.005 --> 27:21.136
No, I used to enjoy thinking about the people that came to what was then called the Town Hall, which was the professional series, and I remember some of those people thinking that was awful special that they came to our community.

27:21.938 --> 27:27.226
I remember when they made the movie We've Never Been Licked, I broke up the set on that a couple of times.

27:27.968 --> 27:28.789
Describe that.

27:28.837 --> 27:52.650
Well, a lot of that filming was done in Cebiza, and I used to go in there because I was mesmerized by Martha O'Driscoll and what was the other girl's name, whatever it was, and I used to get there and make faces at them, and I'd make them laugh as a little kid, and they would run me out of the set on two or three occasions.

27:54.031 --> 27:57.014
Did you see Robert Mitchum?

27:57.034 --> 27:58.857
Yeah, Noah Berry Jr.

27:58.997 --> 28:01.480
and Robert Mitchum.

28:02.921 --> 28:06.065
They were all here and it was kind of interesting.

28:06.145 --> 28:09.709
I used to go to the picture show all the time so it was fun to see them make one.

28:10.510 --> 28:11.411
Where did they live?

28:11.451 --> 28:13.954
I mean, where did they stay, spend the night when they were here?

28:15.176 --> 28:16.337
I don't know the answer to that.

28:17.518 --> 28:19.941
Did they eat where you all could see them?

28:21.383 --> 28:22.384
They would eat lunch.

28:23.005 --> 28:34.222
These sets where you said you made faces, were these indoor or outdoor scenes?

28:34.242 --> 28:35.123
Well, some of both.

28:36.345 --> 28:42.955
I remember the Kyle Field scene where they invited all the local people to come fill up Kyle Field.

28:43.812 --> 28:47.096
And then there were a lot of scenes that were shot in Cebiza.

28:48.058 --> 28:54.246
The dances and some of the other scenes, they had quite a set in Cebiza.

28:55.908 --> 28:56.849
Because this is 1943?

28:57.009 --> 28:58.752
Something like that.

29:00.194 --> 29:02.136
So you're almost a teenager.

29:02.156 --> 29:04.059
Yeah.

29:04.079 --> 29:08.204
And did mom or dad ever threaten you with punishment?

29:08.685 --> 29:08.745
No.

29:08.765 --> 29:10.267
They used to threaten me all the time.

29:10.287 --> 29:13.431
I don't remember that they ever did over that situation.

29:14.204 --> 29:24.057
But my mama used to really get to me when I was old enough that she'd tell me to go out and pick out a switch and bring it to her.

29:24.217 --> 29:26.140
And that was always very humiliating.

29:28.643 --> 29:33.729
Now, older brother goes away, he plays freshman football and then goes away to the service.

29:33.830 --> 29:34.110
Right.

29:35.752 --> 29:38.035
What impression did that make on you as a youngster?

29:38.183 --> 29:39.665
Made a big impression on me.

29:39.825 --> 29:42.128
I hated very much to see my brother leave.

29:42.488 --> 29:51.219
I was very impressed with my brother and what he had done and regretted very much that he had to leave.

29:51.299 --> 29:52.801
That really bothered me.

29:54.503 --> 30:02.132
I used to wear some of his clothes and think to myself, I'll be awful glad when he comes back and gets his clothes.

30:04.205 --> 30:10.454
How did the campus change during the war?

30:10.474 --> 30:15.722
Well, the big change on the campus during the war was that there were so many people on the campus.

30:16.283 --> 30:26.618
You had all the Navy, you had all the Air Force, and you had all the ASTP people, and my mother was the hostess at

30:27.374 --> 30:37.367
the lounge in Keist Hall, I believe is the name of it, dorm two.

30:39.558 --> 30:43.222
That was open for the military people and particularly the Navy.

30:44.043 --> 31:07.270
My aunt who lived with us worked for the USDA at the time and I just, I know that it always fascinated me all of the military people that were there plus how many military people moved in and a lot of those kids were in our school.

31:09.157 --> 31:15.126
It just, it seemed like the campus was much busier than it had ever been before, but that was the big difference.

31:15.547 --> 31:22.958
Did that broaden your perception, because these must have been youngsters from a wide geographic area.

31:22.978 --> 31:32.953
Most of them were from the north or east, and that was the first time I'd ever been around them much, and yeah, I think I gained an impression out of that.

31:36.699 --> 31:37.881
Do you remember,
