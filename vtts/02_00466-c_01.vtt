00:01.769 --> 00:31.287
The military

00:01.769 --> 00:31.287
has had enough problems

00:01.769 --> 00:31.287
with divorces and things like that because when 
you isolate a young man during one of his very

00:01.769 --> 00:31.287
formative

00:01.769 --> 00:31.287
times in his life, it's hardly just and i used to 
know a consulting marriage psychologist

00:32.093 --> 00:59.552
and he made a flat statement

00:32.093 --> 00:59.552
that marriages resulted from campus romances

00:32.093 --> 00:59.552
where they got a chance to see various people had 
the highest degree of success

01:01.456 --> 01:06.482
than any other group. So I can see nothing wrong

01:06.502 --> 01:13.189
with Gletch. And I don't think A&M could have grown 
if it had been all military. Also, during this

01:19.557 --> 01:24.983
time, of course, the first blacks came to A&M 
during the all-runner .

01:29.435 --> 01:35.143
I have no objection to

01:29.435 --> 01:35.143
it. I do not like to have black caucuses or green 
caucuses or ethnic caucuses. Any student

01:46.139 --> 01:49.404
organizations? No. Except just to meet and visit 
his friends. I object to bilingual education.

01:59.978 --> 02:08.708
If an individual is going to be a citizen of the 
United States, I expect him to speak the language

01:59.978 --> 02:08.708
of the nation. And nothing infuriates me more than 
go to a soda fountain and have two Latin Americans

02:08.728 --> 02:24.908
behind the counter that speak in Spanish.

02:24.928 --> 02:28.652
Maintain some of your ethnic background is good, 
If we're going to be citizens, let's all talk the

02:29.915 --> 02:36.122
same language.

02:36.142 --> 02:37.784
What about the draft? Do you think now, of course, 
with the recent registration again, what's your

02:37.804 --> 02:47.115
opinion on the professional arm? I think it's an 
absolute necessity. In other words, you'd rather

02:50.379 --> 02:54.204
have a professional volunteer service than a 
draft?

02:56.967 --> 02:58.048
No, sir.

03:00.543 --> 03:08.873
Again, it depends on the times, when the Army looks 
good pay-wise and times when it looks bad

03:00.543 --> 03:08.873
pay-wise. When I joined the 6th Division in 1940, 
they'd been on a recruiting mission on the

03:09.654 --> 03:25.112
foothills of Arkansas and Missouri. And probably 
a promise of a pair of shoes and three meals a day was

03:25.132 --> 03:30.178
a big incentive. When times get such that

03:31.745 --> 03:56.177
the money is poor in the Army and too good on the 
outside, but you've got to have a level of

03:31.745 --> 03:56.177
intelligence to be able to do what you want to do, 
particularly the more complicated the weapons,

03:31.745 --> 03:56.177
the more complicated the communication systems 
are, the computers. You can't have low IQ people

03:56.197 --> 03:58.680
doing that. My oldest son

04:00.837 --> 04:08.910
was just 33 now. He was kind of facing the draft. I 
could have gotten him on guard, but he never asked

04:13.578 --> 04:20.670
me. Finally, he asked me one day, and I called 
Austin, and they called Washington. He called

04:26.470 --> 04:35.400
back and said, we have an agreement with General 
Hershey, who incidentally I knew, that once he

04:26.470 --> 04:35.400
calls him, we won't touch him. I said, that's fair 
enough. I could have gotten him to the guard. So was

04:42.148 --> 04:42.509
he drafted? Yes, sir. No. He signed up for four 
years

04:44.171 --> 04:53.382
in the regular army in lieu of the draft. So he could 
have chosen whatever he wanted to do. What

04:54.703 --> 04:56.325
about... the new issue of drafting women. What's 
your opinion

04:59.395 --> 05:05.081
on that? I have mixed feelings about that.

05:10.365 --> 05:17.712
I feel like it's just as much their country

05:10.365 --> 05:17.712
as it is mine. I do feel like there's certain combat 
jobs that the majority of them are not able to A few

05:24.959 --> 05:28.462
individuals, yes. But there's a lot of other jobs. 
They can cook. They can clerk. They can clean the

05:36.089 --> 05:41.854
latrines just about anybody else. Now, from the 
standpoint

05:41.874 --> 05:53.124
of keeping the male and the female separated,

05:41.874 --> 05:53.124
it could be a problem. It creates a discord. But I 
feel like it's their country, just like it is mine.

06:00.220 --> 06:06.689
So do you think they should be driving?

06:06.709 --> 06:06.789
Yes. But I don't think they should be in front 
lines. I'm basically out of questions for this

06:10.695 --> 06:14.781
interview. Is there anything that you feel that 
I've missed about your career that we should talk

06:15.061 --> 06:20.869
about? You trained me to drive. know about what my 
philosophies are and why my feelings

06:24.106 --> 06:30.454
are. I'm still kind of a patriot now, I guess. I 
think this is the finest country in the world, even

06:35.020 --> 06:40.147
in spite of our mistakes. We're a nation of laws, 
not men. All men get in the way sometimes, but it

06:44.113 --> 06:49.920
doesn't matter. OK, well, thank you very much, 
sir.
