WEBVTT

00:03.254 --> 00:03.935
OK, let's go. OK, I'm ready. Enough about 2001 
nights. Now, first of all, I should like to know

00:08.760 --> 00:11.763
what interested you in oceanography.

00:15.887 --> 00:16.848
Specifically, you mean? Specifically,

00:17.329 --> 00:20.973
yeah. Well, my first real involvement in 
oceanography was during World War II with surf and

00:20.993 --> 00:30.983
beaches. working out of the University of 
California on landing craft, performance of

00:31.604 --> 00:39.375
waves, depths. That was my first actual 
scientific involvement, 1945, I guess, 44, or

00:39.515 --> 00:50.470
thereabouts.

00:50.810 --> 00:56.398
More generally, of course, I'd been interested in 
oceanography or in the oceans quite a long time

00:50.810 --> 00:56.398
before that. I was a commercial fisherman for 
three years off the Oregon coast and always was,

01:01.523 --> 01:11.499
since childhood, was interested in the oceans and 
got a great thrill out of fishing in the surf or off

01:01.523 --> 01:11.499
the boat or out of a skiff. When were you a 
commercial fisherman? About 1936 to 39. I have you

01:16.908 --> 01:20.714
at Oregon State University from 30 to 41. That's 
about right. It took me about that long to get

01:22.217 --> 01:23.679
through. But I don't have you receiving a degree. I 
didn't. I got a degree at Berkeley. That's right.

01:30.183 --> 01:32.745
What did you do at Oregon State University? Oh, I 
took things as long as I could stand it, and then did

01:32.765 --> 01:37.010
something else. I joined and went in the forestry 
service, worked in the three C's that were

01:37.110 --> 01:46.479
settlement administration, worked as a logger, 
went fishing, then go back to school.

01:47.801 --> 01:53.226
Fortunately, I sort of kept up my academic record 
there at reasonably respectable levels. It was a

01:56.198 --> 02:15.380
good experience because it allowed me to take all 
kinds of different subjects which I always felt I

01:56.198 --> 02:15.380
profited from, engineering, science, 
literature, and much better I think than in my

01:56.198 --> 02:15.380
particular case than going straight through 
school in some sort of a rigorous curriculum. Was

02:15.400 --> 02:21.868
it economic pressure, the depression that sent 
you to these various jobs, or was it just

02:15.400 --> 02:21.868
wanderlust?

02:22.574 --> 02:27.741
I was all three plus my poor handling of my finances 
at various times. Such finances as they were

02:29.544 --> 02:31.807
possible in those days. And did you primarily 
concentrate on science while you were at Oregon

02:32.909 --> 02:38.697
State, or just...? Yeah, science, math. I took 
quite a bit of literature. History,

02:42.803 --> 02:48.531
paleontology, engineering, chemistry, 
chemical engineering.

02:51.970 --> 03:12.898
scientist I think this kind of brought us 
education is an essential if we're going to solve

02:51.970 --> 03:12.898
our problems we have to have both kind of pennant we 
have to have both penetrating minds and broadly

02:51.970 --> 03:12.898
comprehensive ones people who have broad 
interests and And I take exception in your point,

03:14.178 --> 03:22.067
education, because I think a person who's broadly 
interested will educate themselves into these

03:14.178 --> 03:22.067
broader areas. But the whole idea that science is 
going to make its breakthroughs and

03:22.868 --> 03:37.365
understanding of the universe and man's position 
in it from narrow approaches versus is boulder

03:22.868 --> 03:37.365
dash. It's got to have both, narrowly penetrating 
approaches and very broadly comprehensive ones.

03:44.249 --> 03:50.116
Science, of course, has capitalized the last few 
centuries on taking things apart. And now it's

03:51.057 --> 03:53.400
clear the problem of putting things together. And 
that's going to take people who have looked at all

03:53.420 --> 03:57.626
the parts spread around the floor, you see. We're 
much in the position of a 12-year-old stating the

03:58.427 --> 04:07.638
TV apart on the kitchen floor, you know, without 
seeing quite how it was together in the first place

03:58.427 --> 04:07.638
in our science. I noticed when you go to Berkeley, 
you major in engineering. That's what your degree

04:11.943 --> 04:13.986
is, a BS in engineering. The fastest degree I could 
get. Oh, okay. Was there such a thing as marine

04:18.176 --> 04:22.082
engineering then? No, no, no. Well, there was 
marine engineering, but that's boat building

04:23.044 --> 04:27.210
type of thing. Old-fashioned marine 
engineering, yeah. No, I took civil.

04:34.562 --> 04:34.782
Okay. And expediency steered you in this 
direction? No, I had... The reason I took

04:41.776 --> 04:54.271
engineering is early in the war, just before the 
war, I took a job as surveyor on a big naval base and

04:41.776 --> 04:54.271
rather rapidly became the chief engineer without 
any engineering training. And this interested me

04:55.692 --> 04:59.837
quite a bit, several factors. First, engineering 
was interesting, which is only applied physics,

04:59.857 --> 05:05.083
really. And secondly, the fact I could do that well 
without any formal engineering training seemed

05:08.810 --> 05:14.478
to me to indicate that might be my fork. And so I 
thought, why not get an engineering degree from

05:14.498 --> 05:20.267
the best engineering school? So I did so. What were 
your career goals when you received an

05:22.210 --> 05:27.438
engineering degree? My career goals were to do... 
I mean, when I did that, I thought I was going to be an

05:31.243 --> 05:34.228
engineer. I truly did. My grandfather had been an 
engineer and charge of the Harriman lines, chief

05:38.662 --> 05:43.909
engineer for the Harriman lines. My father had 
been chief engineer for the Canadian Pacific. And

05:49.416 --> 05:57.727
I'd always been told I was going to be an engineer, 
and I always had resented it and refused to

05:49.416 --> 05:57.727
consider it. And at this time, I decided, yeah, 
that's what I'm going to be. Then when I went out

06:02.193 --> 06:05.057
looking for a job, they all sounded being the 
sectional engineer at Dunsmuir or something like

06:06.893 --> 06:11.077
that. I went back and asked Dean O'Brien if I 
couldn't do some research in the engineering

06:11.097 --> 06:22.790
department, and that's where I got started on the 
waves, beaches, and surf. Oh, okay. That's where I

06:25.693 --> 06:28.075
first met Ravel, too. Where, here? No, on the 
waves, beaches, and surf. Oh, okay. That's what he

06:32.920 --> 06:33.621
said. I was shocked all of a sudden when you'd 
introduce him. something that didn't work out

06:36.290 --> 06:38.493
well. Do you ever regret having not taken a higher 
degree? Do I ever regret it? No, I don't think so.

06:45.363 --> 06:52.433
I'm often told to make sure I never get one because 
it's a phenomenon to have somebody and not have

06:45.363 --> 06:52.433
one, you see. Do you think failure to earn one has 
limited your career, if I may use that word?

07:01.545 --> 07:03.168
I don't know. I haven't really thought about it a 
hell of a lot. That's never worried me anyway. Let

07:09.601 --> 07:10.623
me try a different way. Does it seem to you as if the 
movement towards professional degrees since

07:10.743 --> 07:24.680
World War II, when in effect graduate degrees have 
become essential to the various academic

07:10.743 --> 07:24.680
professions, do you think that's potentially a 
mistake? Well, I think I would have progressed

07:27.084 --> 07:34.613
farther and accomplished less, or I could have 
progressed farther by accomplishing less, let me

07:27.084 --> 07:34.613
say. If I'd had a higher degree there, that's a good 
statement. Yeah. No, what strikes me is there are

07:41.600 --> 07:50.173
all kinds of historians and scientists who come 
out of World War II with either no degrees or BA

07:41.600 --> 07:50.173
degrees who accomplish a great deal. That ends 
someplace in the 50s as society becomes more

07:50.594 --> 07:53.758
technical. And yet, in a way, it doesn't seem to be 
as creative now as it once was. Would you agree with

07:57.263 --> 07:58.005
that? Well, I don't know. There are pros and cons 
about the higher degrees. It tends to be a document

08:04.023 --> 08:08.488
that is an entree, of course. And I one time had a 
student who was, I thought, quite dull. And I tried

08:13.474 --> 08:19.360
to persuade him to forget about it and get a higher 
degree. And he said, you mean all those five years

08:20.481 --> 08:26.208
of work is wasted? And I said, you mean you didn't 
learn anything? I said, what were you doing? It

08:31.614 --> 08:32.595
can't be wasted. And he stopped for a minute, and 
then he said the most intelligent thing he's ever

08:32.795 --> 08:36.179
said. He says, you know, Dr. Isaacs, which was an 
interesting statement in itself, I'm just not

08:36.239 --> 08:43.869
smart enough to get anywhere without a PhD.

08:46.953 --> 08:49.796
And he wasn't, that's for sure. So you see, the PhD, 
it seems to me, and the higher degrees have their

08:50.237 --> 08:55.984
pros and cons associated with them. Now, I want to 
break away from the chronology for a second, and I

08:58.411 --> 09:05.965
want you to describe and give the significance of 
these things I've listed. Good heavens. Okay.

09:11.114 --> 09:18.167
Now, first of all, before I begin, as an engineer, 
were you asked to solve specialized problems? Is

09:18.247 --> 09:18.968
this what... accounts for this list of 
inventions, or as a matter of fact, did these come

09:19.741 --> 09:25.868
to you? You're telling me now that you're going to 
give me a list of inventions? Yes, that's right.

09:31.795 --> 09:34.358
No, I always selected my own problems first. And 
did people didn't come to you with research

09:34.378 --> 09:41.627
problems and say, how would you as an engineer 
solve this? Sometimes. Sometimes.

09:47.180 --> 09:49.663
about how to make a mid-water trawl.

09:53.286 --> 09:59.993
Well, if that occurred in the process of 
mentioning these, would you explain who came to

09:53.286 --> 09:59.993
you and what were the circumstances to involve? 
Sure. Good heavens, that sounds like an endless

10:01.495 --> 10:03.657
list. No, I only listed 12 or 13, just not all of 
them, as a matter of fact. 1945, a device for

10:10.083 --> 10:15.068
traversing surf zones and beaches. Oh. Well, I was 
working then on amphibious craft and several

10:16.947 --> 10:20.833
aspects. How in the devil did you get a line out 
through these tremendous surfs of Northern

10:21.313 --> 10:26.120
California and Oregon and Washington? Well, you 
could shoot one out. And I would watch during the

10:30.347 --> 10:41.503
war boats come in, land on the beach, get broadside 
swamped, and somebody trying to get a line through

10:30.347 --> 10:41.503
to pull them off or help them one way or another. And 
they get broached and swung and so forth. So

10:44.124 --> 10:46.546
wouldn't it be nice if you could just send a line 
out? And wouldn't it be nice if you could put

10:46.766 --> 10:53.772
something in the surf that would take an 
instrument out there so you could measure the

10:46.766 --> 10:53.772
waves? Or put a rod on it and measure the surf. So 
it's obvious that waves have plenty of power to do

10:58.577 --> 11:02.360
this kind of thing. So you make a flap and you 
rectify the wave so it forces it only out. And he put

11:10.998 --> 11:12.540
it together. And he said, no, nobody came to me on 
that one. OK. Does your work with this lead you

11:17.729 --> 11:22.757
later on to working with wave power? Wave 
propulsion, sure. Sure, years later. Also

11:27.444 --> 11:33.714
understanding something about undertow and 
worrying about sand motion and quite a few things.

11:33.734 --> 11:34.155
All right. And this began, in effect, from a 
military project. Yeah. military project of

11:38.403 --> 11:41.128
understanding amphibious craft. Okay. Would you 
judge the military, if I may say that, to play a

11:42.470 --> 11:49.883
sizable role in the development and advancement 
of oceanography in this period? Of course. ONR

11:51.085 --> 11:56.694
was, which was Ravel's baby, was of course a 
powerful influence and a very, very valuable one.

11:57.155 --> 12:00.681
One of the best sponsors of research that ever 
existed. I was also thinking possibly about

12:01.842 --> 12:09.593
experience gained in things in anti-submarine 
warfare, for example, in anti-mine activities.

12:09.753 --> 12:11.976
Sure, a lot of those things have worked out.

12:15.001 --> 12:28.440
You really have to look at the environment of a 
submarine, and this gives you, I think, requires

12:15.001 --> 12:28.440
considerable thought into just exactly what is 
the meaning of placing this object in the ocean and

12:15.001 --> 12:28.440
its influences on it. Some of that, of course, 
classified material, but the mine itself, the

12:29.399 --> 12:48.047
objects on the bottom, the manner in which scour 
takes place, the release of particles, the

12:29.399 --> 12:48.047
release of bubbles, the influence, the 
collections of fish around it as part of the

12:29.399 --> 12:48.047
biological response to this object. All these 
things are part of beginning to build up a model of

12:48.467 --> 12:58.562
how the ocean puts together, even though they are 
directed towards a specific military need, I

12:48.467 --> 12:58.562
think. If you look at them not as a highly specified 
task, but rather as, from the broader standpoint

12:58.812 --> 13:16.158
of here's an object within the natural 
environment, how does it make its presence known

12:58.812 --> 13:16.158
and what are its influences? Then, of course, if 
you look at it that way, it has not just the military

13:17.701 --> 13:21.606
limitation. ONR allowed you to do these sorts of 
things. It was one of the most...

13:26.960 --> 13:41.375
ONR, I think, was one of the freest and most 
valuable types of sponsorship that oceanography

13:26.960 --> 13:41.375
has ever had. Do you think ONR is more 
mission-oriented now than it was then? Sure, I

13:45.259 --> 13:45.940
think so. I hardly know what it's like. I have very 
little contact with it. I think it's gotten very

13:50.204 --> 13:53.487
mission-oriented. Is there any particular 
explanation for that? Oh, I think the whole United

13:56.542 --> 14:04.592
States has never kind of quite recovered from the 
more bangs for a buck or how many philosophy. That

14:05.613 --> 14:14.464
is, a fixed objective towards which you progress 
never allows for the unexpected to emerge, does

14:05.613 --> 14:14.464
it? The unexpected is almost always more valuable 
than the expected, because expected is something

14:15.565 --> 14:21.873
you obviously know can exist. Unexpected can be 
unlimited in its importance.

14:28.672 --> 14:32.658
What about the magnesium rod release device in 
1947? Oh, heavens. Yeah. Well, I was trying to make

14:35.523 --> 14:46.420
a pressure gauge for measuring waves in deep water 
and did so, but I needed to load it in cockets. After

14:47.662 --> 14:54.072
it got to depth, I needed to open up a reservoir so it 
flooded with gas, and I needed something that was

14:47.662 --> 14:54.072
simple that would release it. And Dean O'Brien 
said to me, as a matter of fact, Dean O'Brien, the

14:55.165 --> 15:02.978
head of the engineering school at Berkeley, said 
to me, why don't you look into magnesium? It makes a

15:03.779 --> 15:06.984
good little battery with steel or brass. And so I 
put it together, and it looked fine. Just held the

15:11.450 --> 15:15.395
valve open with a magnesium wire. After an easily 
calculable time, it released. That all led into

15:19.921 --> 15:22.304
looking at magnesium batteries. Magnesium was 
its power source. OK. What about the torpedo net in

15:26.609 --> 15:30.494
1947? Yeah. Yeah, that was a more or less specific 
project. And that was one of the few projects I ever

15:36.541 --> 15:39.465
worked with. what was then the Bureau of Yards and 
Docks, I think, in which they had a great deal of

15:40.036 --> 15:51.423
trouble with torpedo nets tearing apart. Well, a 
torpedo net is a very strange object. manner in

15:55.291 --> 15:58.874
which stress is distributed through it is 
complicated. But more particularly, that was the

15:59.274 --> 16:15.648
first hint I had of what's more recently developed 
into several things called, for instance, the

15:59.274 --> 16:15.648
breakwater, in that these big net floats behave 
very curiously in the sea. And they behave very

16:16.049 --> 16:24.876
curiously because they were non-Archimedean 
bodies, to use the word improperly. bodies on the

16:25.683 --> 16:32.112
sea surface that had much more displacement than 
they had mass, and free to move with. So they were

16:32.372 --> 16:36.498
forced to move in an exaggerated fashion. This is 
one of the reasons that the torpedo nets were torn

16:36.518 --> 16:50.036
apart, because the floats were driven by 
something other than the orbital velocities of

16:36.518 --> 16:50.036
the waves. And this put them out of phase with the 
net that they were supporting. And this is the

16:55.670 --> 17:06.787
first hint I got of, as you begin to get larger and 
larger things in the ocean, accelerated forces

16:55.670 --> 17:06.787
play the more dominant role than surface forces.

17:09.551 --> 17:12.936
Does this end up later on then also involved in the 
energy project? Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah. Well, does

17:17.522 --> 17:19.946
it also end up? But the principal thing you see is 
something that is a concept which other people

17:24.779 --> 17:29.865
have probably understood much better than I have. 
But as you go to these larger and larger objects in a

17:30.466 --> 17:45.824
varying pressure field, like a wave,

17:30.466 --> 17:45.824
the smaller objects are driven by drag, ordinary 
drag forces, hydraulic, hydrodynamic drag. And

17:46.745 --> 17:53.132
then, even though you keep everything 
symmetrical and you merely scale it up into larger

17:53.821 --> 18:04.804
and larger dimensions, there's one aspect, and 
that's the accelerated forces, that scales on a

17:53.821 --> 18:04.804
one-to-one basis. That is, the forces are always 
equal to the volume. In other words, the dimension

18:11.118 --> 18:13.703
to the third power. where its surface forces go 
like the dimension squared. And thus, when you

18:18.493 --> 18:39.634
begin to get into very large objects, but not too 
large objects, in the wave field, such as the big

18:18.493 --> 18:39.634
lakes of Texas Towers, an offshore drilling 
platform, it's clear that they're driven far more

18:18.493 --> 18:39.634
by the accelerated forces, which act on the total 
volume of them, than by the surface forces. And you

18:40.975 --> 18:42.897
might as well forget the surface forces. And these 
are aspects that are still forgotten. For

18:46.312 --> 19:13.035
instance, in these big OTEC programs, where 
you're starting to put very large, slow-moving

18:46.312 --> 19:13.035
things in the ocean for ocean thermal energy 
conversion, the people, the very erudite people

18:46.312 --> 19:13.035
at APL and Lockheed, just totally forgot the fact 
that they're mainly dealing with accelerations,

18:46.312 --> 19:13.035
inertial forces. rather than the ordinary 
conventional frictional hydrodynamic dragons.

19:20.482 --> 19:22.825
And so they've made some mistakes.

19:25.809 --> 19:28.233
See, one thing scales like the square of the 
dimensions. The other scales like the cube of the

19:28.273 --> 19:30.055
dimensions. And even though it's a trivial effect 
at very small dimensions, it becomes a dominant on

19:30.095 --> 19:40.069
a very large dimension, since it's going up like a 
cube.

19:43.880 --> 19:51.067
You've been out in the desert and you've seen these 
great boulders as big as a room that are way out in

19:43.880 --> 19:51.067
the desert somewhere? Yes. How'd they get there? 
They're obviously carried there by water. Well,

19:56.072 --> 20:04.860
at the moment that a flood wave hits a boulder like 
that, the crest of a flood wave hits a boulder, the

19:56.072 --> 20:04.860
boulder is easily moved as a sand grain. Because 
you see, it's now at that moment subject to volume

20:06.282 --> 20:12.908
forces that scale just exactly like its weight. 
For frictional forces, it didn't care less. Once

20:15.724 --> 20:19.930
the flood flow is established, the boulder sits 
there. It's like a lead toad that works. But at that

20:23.695 --> 20:27.841
instant, when the crest comes, it's as easily 
moved as a sand grain. So for an instance, it's

20:28.141 --> 20:29.723
moved. And a succession of these, and out it is, out 
in the desert, miles away. You can't conceive of

20:34.210 --> 20:36.212
how it got there. This is all part of the same 
phenomenology. And I think it's an interesting

20:39.116 --> 20:41.680
one. I believe I capitalized on it in a couple of 
cases, yeah. That came from the submarine net

20:46.808 --> 20:48.650
problem, yes. Okay, and what about the thermopile 
wave meter? Well, that's... I watched these.

21:00.802 --> 21:04.386
These are all very old things.

21:05.907 --> 21:08.550
That was a special problem, I think. I wanted to 
see... if we couldn't establish a very simple wave

21:11.596 --> 21:23.070
measuring device that could be put out to sea 
simply by a landing craft, dropped by a landing

21:11.596 --> 21:23.070
craft. So a beach master trying to bring landing 
craft in through the surf could observe the

21:24.252 --> 21:41.333
oncoming waves before they became breakers on a 
meter of some sort on the beach. and guide the

21:41.819 --> 21:46.846
landing craft into the lower breakers to come to 
the surf zone. Now, it didn't need to be exact. All

21:48.469 --> 21:50.211
it needed to be was relative correct. He would see 
big waves coming in. He'd see the breakers. He'd

21:53.817 --> 21:55.259
know they couldn't survive that. And then he'd see 
a series of lower waves coming in. And he could

21:58.524 --> 22:04.713
beckon them in at that point, see, or vector them in 
with the radio. So that's the simplest device I

22:04.733 --> 22:08.839
could think of, a bag of gas. It's adiabatically 
heated and cooled by the wave pressure in there and

22:09.173 --> 22:22.445
a simple little thermopile inside up against sea 
water on conductive to sea water on the other side

22:09.173 --> 22:22.445
to make the cold junction or the reference 
junction. And it just responded to the waves, and

22:23.646 --> 22:27.389
he could see the high ones, and he could see the low 
ones. That's all he had to see. He didn't have to

22:28.790 --> 22:31.833
know how high they were. He knew that the big ones 
were producing waves, breakers that he didn't

22:31.873 --> 22:37.898
want his craft to be in. He could tell them to 
retract or to dander at the optimum times. That was

22:43.535 --> 22:50.861
the purpose of that whole

22:43.535 --> 22:50.861
thing. What about the Isaac's kid mid-water 
troll? There's a case where Dr. Hubbs came

22:54.924 --> 23:07.075
to me and he wanted Annette to really take the run 
deep, fast, and take the bath pelagic fish. And Lou

23:15.732 --> 23:17.854
Kidd and I worked on that. And I must say, I think we 
lucked out on that one because it's always been a

23:18.175 --> 23:32.590
bit strange to me that we cut that, we got that net 
hung, we got that diving vane made, We got the

23:33.818 --> 23:53.025
bridles cut and we took it out to sea and 
immediately we filled beautifully, dove

23:33.818 --> 23:53.025
beautifully, went down deep and we could tow it at 
three, four thousand meters at reasonable speeds

23:33.818 --> 23:53.025
and Even today, if those bridles are cut a few 
inches different, the damn thing doesn't work. I

23:58.475 --> 24:00.058
never understood. You know, we could have been so 
discouraged we'd never have followed it through.

24:04.264 --> 24:10.153
And I see that thing all over the world, you know, 
and that bridle is right to the same inch. And it was

24:10.674 --> 24:12.918
pretty much of a thrill, really, in those days. I 
remember those days quite well. On our first trips

24:14.780 --> 24:19.047
out, we would make hauls that would, increased the 
number of specimens of some rare fish in the

24:19.600 --> 24:24.985
museums of the world by 50. You know, one haul.

24:29.049 --> 24:31.251
There had only been 10 in all the museums of the 
world. We get 500 of the things. And of course, then

24:33.694 --> 24:37.938
specimen after specimen, it was totally 
unidentified. It was quite a thrill. We made a

24:42.222 --> 24:45.625
20-foot one one time. rammed it into the bottom 
through an axe or a parlance. Took one of the

24:51.153 --> 24:54.557
greatest bottom trawls that anybody ever took.

24:57.381 --> 25:01.666
Rare brachiopods and glass sponges. That's 
probably considered in terms of oceanography

25:01.686 --> 25:06.632
your most important and famous invention. Would 
you agree with that? Oh, I don't. I wouldn't try to

25:09.575 --> 25:10.637
judge it. It certainly has been very broadly 
spread around the world. And I kind of suffer from

25:14.691 --> 25:23.180
it to some extent, because I go to some outlandish 
place, and that's what I'm known for. You see, the

25:23.820 --> 25:26.583
Isaac Kidman letter trunk. Well, I'm really 
trying to edge your question in to you unfairly, so

25:26.603 --> 25:32.429
let me ask you directly. That is, if you should like 
to name what you consider your major

25:32.449 --> 25:40.637
accomplishment, what would you name? You mean 
something specific? Something specific, yeah.

25:43.963 --> 25:48.328
If you just wanted, you know, it was always said 
John Adams wanted such and such carved upon his

25:43.963 --> 25:48.328
tombstone. If you just had to be remembered for one 
thing, what would you like to be remembered for?

25:53.474 --> 25:56.318
Oh, good heavens, I'd hate to be remembered for one 
thing.

25:59.141 --> 26:06.189
Well, I'd rather to think this whole approach of 
this dynamic breakwater is going to be a

25:59.141 --> 26:06.189
considerable breakthrough. I think it's going to 
revolutionize The whole method of defending

26:10.233 --> 26:36.460
ourselves against the destructive influences of 
waves, beach erosion, harbors, I think it has the

26:10.233 --> 26:36.460
potential of allowing the

26:10.233 --> 26:36.460
defense of our eroding coastlines, of protecting 
structures offshore, of making harbors of refuge

26:37.300 --> 27:03.831
in the open sea of protecting small beaches at 
fishing villages and remote places in a way that

26:37.300 --> 27:03.831
can be afforded of

26:37.300 --> 27:03.831
so that people can pull their primitive boats out 
over the over the beach and get themselves some

26:37.300 --> 27:03.831
fish and

26:37.300 --> 27:03.831
make swimming beaches in places where Surf now 
makes it essentially impossible, and on and on.

27:13.112 --> 27:18.837
There's quite a different approach to harbor 
protection, for example, than these damn rubble

27:13.112 --> 27:18.837
mound breakwaters. And of course, it's totally 
the opposite direction. It's interesting to

27:23.722 --> 27:32.451
conceive that no matter how long you develop the 
rubble mound breakwater, you'd never come up with

27:23.722 --> 27:32.451
the idea of putting the lightest possible thing in 
the ocean. And it takes a 180 degree shift to do

27:33.055 --> 27:35.838
that. And it works on a different principle.

27:40.483 --> 27:41.805
I think maybe that's it. I'd expect to see the 
iceberg really solve some problems. I think the

27:45.029 --> 27:50.175
Israelis would do it now. They don't really have 
the money. But they would do it, except the minimum

27:52.958 --> 27:56.762
iceberg they could bring is too big. It covers the 
whole damn state with three feet of water. Arabs

28:03.211 --> 28:05.939
are going to do it, or so have announced. And it 
certainly is a natural one for them. The US is too

28:07.725 --> 28:14.385
followed up, I think, to do anything quite so 
dramatic.
