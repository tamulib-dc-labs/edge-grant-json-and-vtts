WEBVTT

00:02.798 --> 00:05.883
Not as far as a grade, no, no, no.

00:05.903 --> 00:13.857
I've had pressure put on them to try to do something to get my student or my son a dorm room or get them a meditation.

00:13.877 --> 00:16.281
I don't have anything to do with that, but they, you know, they call me.

00:16.301 --> 00:18.124
Because they think, because they know you.

00:18.104 --> 00:19.005
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

00:19.046 --> 00:20.308
They say, well, can't you do something?

00:21.029 --> 00:22.772
They can't get in the dorms.

00:22.872 --> 00:24.835
I can't do a thing.

00:24.875 --> 00:26.358
I've had that a few times.

00:27.259 --> 00:33.369
Get in vet school occasionally, but you know, tell them they're selected by certain procedures, and I can't do anything with that.

00:34.431 --> 00:38.037
All right, the next last question then that I can think of is,

00:38.017 --> 00:50.096
If somebody gave you a check for a million dollars with one restriction, you must pass it to A&M, but you decide the use of the money, what would you want?

00:50.116 --> 00:52.520
Student scholarship funds, student loan funds.

00:53.361 --> 00:54.743
For what kind of students?

00:55.448 --> 01:01.135
For our veterinary students, I think, or even our summer pre-vet students.

01:01.235 --> 01:02.336
Which ones?

01:02.817 --> 01:03.297
Which ones?

01:03.617 --> 01:04.599
You know, how would I limit it?

01:04.939 --> 01:05.600
Yeah, yeah.

01:05.620 --> 01:06.501
How do you select the?

01:06.521 --> 01:15.151
Right now, I would say those that have a rural or farm ranch background, try to get more in food animal medicine.

01:15.191 --> 01:15.892
I'd like to see that.

01:16.813 --> 01:20.777
But do the, is it based on their grades or their financial needs or what?

01:20.797 --> 01:21.338
Oh, I see what you mean.

01:22.010 --> 01:25.176
It'd be based a little bit on financial need but grades too.

01:25.356 --> 01:30.745
But the thing, well, yeah, financial need and grades together.

01:31.026 --> 01:33.530
But not exclusively, either one.

01:34.311 --> 01:34.412
Okay.

01:34.432 --> 01:38.499
For example, I've quit interviewing students because I got so upset.

01:38.539 --> 01:43.007
I had two students who had a 3.2 grade average.

01:43.087 --> 01:45.030
I mean fairly good.

01:45.010 --> 01:47.094
but didn't get in because they weren't good enough.

01:47.175 --> 01:50.722
Well, these two students went home every weekend to work on the farm or the ranch people.

01:51.403 --> 01:54.309
If they could stay here and get study all weekend, they would get their 3.5.

01:54.710 --> 01:56.634
Those PBX, that's what you want.

01:56.654 --> 01:57.657
They got that worth ethic.

01:57.897 --> 01:59.340
I like to give it to students like that.

02:01.042 --> 02:06.050
Okay, the last one that I can think of is what feelings do you have in your heart for Texas A&M?

02:06.531 --> 02:07.692
I feel very good about it.

02:09.856 --> 02:19.411
Sometimes get a little frustrated with the, we tend to spend too much money on football stadiums and not enough on classrooms.

02:21.614 --> 02:23.297
That's what my pet peeves were.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.040
Can I ask a question?

02:25.060 --> 02:26.041
Oh, of course, of course.

02:26.202 --> 02:27.724
And since I don't,

02:28.818 --> 02:34.704
I don't know anybody in this whole thing, and the only thing I have is a little bit of reading knowledge of what I've been doing in the background recently.

02:35.505 --> 02:38.608
You were mentioning Dr. Jaggi, or Jaggi, or whatever.

02:38.628 --> 02:38.989
Jaggi.

02:39.009 --> 02:39.729
Jaggi.

02:39.749 --> 02:41.211
And there's a Dr. Milliff.

02:41.231 --> 02:41.952
Milliff.

02:41.972 --> 02:43.253
M-I-L-L-I-F-L.

02:43.293 --> 02:43.854
John Milliff.

02:44.134 --> 02:45.616
I've never met either one of these persons.

02:45.636 --> 02:46.717
I don't even know they're still alive.

02:46.737 --> 02:47.478
They're not, no.

02:47.878 --> 02:57.508
Okay, but I did tell you I was looking at these interviews done in 1980, and again, I don't even know, except working for

02:57.809 --> 02:58.912
just this little project.

02:59.393 --> 03:07.231
And it seemed to me that you're a lot different just by listening to you in the flesh than these individuals were.

03:07.271 --> 03:08.414
And it's not a derogatory.

03:08.434 --> 03:15.210
It's just an observation I'm making that you seem to be, how would I say it,

03:15.511 --> 03:31.883
actually more educated, PhD-wise, more polished, while your predecessors, just by looking at, like I said, I just read these interviews, they were more like of a down-to-earth, kind of a commonsensical, kind of like, they'd say what's on their mind.

03:31.903 --> 03:32.845
I remember seeing

03:33.398 --> 03:40.778
Dr. Trevino, you mentioned his name, he said something about, and he just flat out in his interview said, bullshit.

03:42.022 --> 03:48.319
And these people just seemed to be this kind of down to earth, kind of not so much as

03:48.822 --> 03:55.877
Maybe because the state of medicine was different then is what I guess I'm trying to say and you just seem to be like a different kind of person than you have now on the faculty.

03:56.057 --> 03:57.140
Am I correct?

03:57.160 --> 04:00.627
A lot of that's true and a lot of that changed when we got more women in.

04:00.787 --> 04:03.473
The language was quite a bit different really.

04:03.824 --> 04:09.671
I was forced, I focused and forced on me not to use those type of words or even racial terms.

04:09.911 --> 04:14.236
You know, I didn't use those, but that's very common here when I came.

04:14.256 --> 04:18.401
No, you're saying, they talked about how rough it was in the Corps of Cadets and stuff.

04:18.701 --> 04:23.707
It just seemed like it was, the faculty, not only the student body has changed, but the faculty has changed.

04:23.727 --> 04:23.967
They have.

04:24.167 --> 04:28.252
Maybe much, because medicine has gotten so much more advanced in the last 20 years.

04:28.812 --> 04:30.154
Well, that could be part of it.

04:30.174 --> 04:32.937
Yeah, it's become more sophisticated, really it has.

04:32.917 --> 04:41.428
And another change would be in most parts of the campus, I don't know about here, the younger faculty will not have on the white shirt and tie every day.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.572
That's right, oh yeah, yeah.

04:44.592 --> 04:46.395
Yeah, that's right.

04:46.875 --> 04:52.122
When I came here, Dr. Price said you wear shirt and tie and coat if necessary every day.

04:52.142 --> 04:54.385
You don't wear boots, you're clean shaven.

04:54.820 --> 05:02.733
And he told me one other thing, I like to work weekends, you know, vacations doing veterinary medicine, you know, take care of people's animals and stuff.

05:02.753 --> 05:05.277
He says, you will not get your license here.

05:05.377 --> 05:10.305
He said, I want you here at the school, not in the countryside on the weekends type of thing.

05:10.325 --> 05:11.707
So I didn't.

05:11.727 --> 05:15.373
I could have got risk positive, but he installed that stuff.

05:15.393 --> 05:18.077
You wear a shirt and tie.

05:19.458 --> 05:23.323
Every day, and coat too, necessary.

05:23.583 --> 05:27.168
He wears short sleeve shirts in the summertime, of course, but he wears shoes.

05:30.432 --> 05:33.756
There's no doubt about it, if you didn't wear them, you're out.

05:33.776 --> 05:35.799
We have one fellow, Ned Ellick, I remember him.

05:36.380 --> 05:39.103
He went away for sabbatical for a year, came back in a beard.

05:39.860 --> 05:43.589
I saw him walk down the hall and Dean Price saw him.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.614
He had that beard off that day.

05:46.456 --> 05:50.325
He told him, you get rid of that beard or you're out of here.

05:51.250 --> 05:51.971
That's the way it was.

05:55.857 --> 05:59.863
Did you finish before we interrupted you about your feelings about A&M today?

06:00.664 --> 06:17.629
I feel very good about it, but I do have those hang-ups about big salaries for the head coaches and they do a good job, but I think it's travesty that in particular classrooms where you look at Kyle Field over there, it's going to get bigger.

06:18.183 --> 06:19.450
How many times a year is that used?

06:20.455 --> 06:21.581
How often are classrooms used?

06:21.601 --> 06:22.405
We don't have enough classrooms.

06:22.426 --> 06:25.341
Now they're going to buy a building out here south of town just so they have more space.

06:25.861 --> 06:29.025
I teach school real public health students and they're over in the Wells Fargo building.

06:30.808 --> 06:32.850
That's a crime department.

06:32.870 --> 06:33.671
I just feel that way.

06:33.832 --> 06:34.613
I agree with that.

06:34.633 --> 06:35.654
I mean I'm only a grad student.

06:35.674 --> 06:40.661
I think football, you know, it's like I graduated with a master's from the University of Louisville.

06:40.681 --> 06:42.423
I didn't graduate with a degree in basketball.

06:42.463 --> 06:51.615
Mine was in history and I felt that the basketball coach, like you say, he might be very good, Denny Crum, but he's not worth a quarter million dollars if you put it into the university.

06:51.595 --> 06:52.640
But I like football.

06:52.660 --> 06:59.430
I like them all, but I don't see where we've got to have an edifice that you can see from Caldwell.

06:59.450 --> 07:00.475
That's a great thing.
