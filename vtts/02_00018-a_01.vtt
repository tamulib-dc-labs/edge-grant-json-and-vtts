00:00:02.107 --> 00:00:05.599
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:00:09.272 --> 00:00:12.825
X, Y, Z, X, Y, Z, X, Y, Z.

00:00:16.805 --> 00:00:28.400
This is Monday, January 9, and sitting in the back wing of the Hal Booty Building, getting ready to interview Dr. Robert Berg, Distinguished Professor of Geology.

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:31.304
Now check your, say, one sentence.

00:00:31.324 --> 00:00:33.427
Testing, one, two, three.

00:00:34.688 --> 00:00:35.349
There you go.

00:00:36.671 --> 00:00:45.883
Bob, for the sake of someone who might listen to this tape or review it many years from now, would you summarize your career experience

00:00:46.387 --> 00:00:47.909
before you came to A&M?

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.355
Where'd you grow up, go to college, where had you worked and taught before coming to A&M?

00:00:53.356 --> 00:01:00.966
I was born in St. Paul, Minnesota and began picking up fossils along the banks of the Mississippi at the age of nine.

00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:04.431
This got me into geology of course.

00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:12.782
In Minnesota they didn't know anything about geology but they knew about iron mining so everybody said I should

00:01:14.112 --> 00:01:15.598
be a mining engineer.

00:01:16.723 --> 00:01:24.173
So I enrolled in the university in 1942, I think it was, and enrolled in the mine school.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.512
They gave us a little book.

00:01:29.713 --> 00:01:34.658
This pamphlet was on the alumni summaries.

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:49.332
It was a very thin book at that time, and it was filled with references such as, graduated in mining engineering in 1925, went to work for the South Rhodesian Mining Company, deceased in Africa in 1927.

00:01:50.734 --> 00:01:55.358
From that, I realized that there would always be job openings for mining engineers.

00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:04.483
I changed my major, though, after working in an open pit mine and subsequently underground.

00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:12.554
I changed it to geology, where a person could be out in the bright sunshine.

00:02:15.137 --> 00:02:24.670
I got my Ph.D. in 1951, after three years in the Army.

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:30.979
I went to work for the California Company in the Rocky Mountain area.

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.407
That was a subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of California.

00:02:36.071 --> 00:02:37.815
And I worked for them for six years.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:44.852
I worked for Independent out of Big Spring, Texas for almost two years.

00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:55.208
And one day our bosses in Big Spring, Texas called us up in Denver and said we'd like to have you moved down to Big Spring.

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.973
And so we said we got a better idea.

00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:10.030
So we took over their interests in the Rocky Mountain area on a half-time retainer and we became consultants.

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:14.773
which meant we did anything in the oil business for money.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:32.244
I spent there for nine years as a consultant.

00:03:32.264 --> 00:03:35.730
The business at that time, so I had a total of 16 years.

00:03:36.385 --> 00:03:45.660
And the business at that time was pretty low, low rate of drilling and so on.

00:03:46.381 --> 00:03:54.394
We managed to make a pretty good living, but during that time I got offers to apply

00:03:55.015 --> 00:04:00.028
on faculties at various places, and none of them sounded too interesting.

00:04:00.048 --> 00:04:02.355
I'd be coming in as an assistant professor.

00:04:03.558 --> 00:04:08.130
And it wasn't until Earl Cook called me in 19...

00:04:09.747 --> 00:04:17.859
66, late in 66, and wondered if I would be interested in a department head.

00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:37.307
Of course, it was a great opportunity because there was a lot of money coming to A&M, reorganization, and I thought, well, if there's any place to start, start a teaching career being as a head, then I could go either direction.

00:04:38.418 --> 00:04:40.541
How did you know Earl Cook?

00:04:43.104 --> 00:04:50.052
Earl had hired a fellow from the USGS, US Geological Survey, by the name of Jim Case.

00:04:50.973 --> 00:04:58.442
And Jim Case was a hard rock geologist plus a geophysicist, gravity and magnetics.

00:04:58.462 --> 00:05:01.106
And he and I knew each other quite well in Denver.

00:05:01.586 --> 00:05:07.193
And so I published a number of papers that had some new ideas.

00:05:07.578 --> 00:05:08.760
for that time.

00:05:09.921 --> 00:05:15.128
And so he's the one that actually recommended me to Earl Cook.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:18.132
And we won't talk about dollars any other time.

00:05:18.252 --> 00:05:19.734
What was the beginning salary?

00:05:20.395 --> 00:05:21.436
Twenty thousand a year.

00:05:21.816 --> 00:05:23.719
Twenty thousand a year to be the department head.

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:24.059
Yeah.

00:05:25.761 --> 00:05:28.946
Did you come to visit before you accepted the position?

00:05:29.226 --> 00:05:34.733
Yes, I came down and actually Earl called me about three times.

00:05:34.713 --> 00:05:37.879
The first two times, I just turned, I was too busy, Earl.

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:39.242
I got too much to do here.

00:05:39.983 --> 00:05:44.112
Finally, the third time, I'd been thinking about it for a couple months, and I said, well, I'll come down.

00:05:44.172 --> 00:05:45.194
That was in October.

00:05:46.396 --> 00:05:54.392
And so I came down, and I accepted the job then, and moved down in January of 67'.

00:05:55.115 --> 00:06:02.822
Describe the department in its staffing and its facilities when you arrived.

00:06:03.743 --> 00:06:08.327
Who was here and where were they?

00:06:08.347 --> 00:06:22.000
Members of the faculty that were already here were Travis Parker, Fred Smith, Clay Seward,

00:06:23.347 --> 00:06:28.497
Carl Koenig and Mel Schroeder.

00:06:30.451 --> 00:06:32.373
Those people were good teachers.

00:06:32.493 --> 00:06:34.935
They had never done any significant research.

00:06:35.116 --> 00:06:39.420
Mel Schroeder, only one that did dabble in research.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.065
And the department's reputation was negligible around the country.

00:06:44.965 --> 00:06:59.580
However, during those years, the 50s in particular, Travis Parker and others turned out some really good students who went on to make a lot of money in the oil business.

00:06:59.813 --> 00:07:10.624
The reputation of A&M in the oil business was tops because of these graduates, not because of the factory.

00:07:10.705 --> 00:07:20.075
So if we could coin the phrase in applied geology, they were well known in petroleum.

00:07:20.095 --> 00:07:20.175
Yes.

00:07:20.195 --> 00:07:24.219
And those were students that by and large had gotten only an undergraduate degree here.

00:07:24.239 --> 00:07:25.720
That's right.

00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:26.441
All right.

00:07:26.461 --> 00:07:29.044
Where was the department located physically on campus?

00:07:30.998 --> 00:07:35.863
Before I got here, the department was in engineering.

00:07:37.985 --> 00:07:40.608
It was called—and the degree was geological engineering.

00:07:41.489 --> 00:07:48.455
When the College of Geosciences was formed, it was taken out of engineering and put in the College of Geosciences.

00:07:48.475 --> 00:07:51.458
Therefore, we couldn't give the geological engineering degree.

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:55.442
We had to give a bachelor of science.

00:07:55.462 --> 00:07:55.863
All right.

00:07:55.883 --> 00:08:00.988
And physically, in what building were they?

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.736
in the front building there since 1930.

00:08:05.557 --> 00:08:06.799
And what was it called then?

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:09.684
Department of Geology.

00:08:09.744 --> 00:08:12.769
No, I mean it's the Hal Booty building today.

00:08:12.789 --> 00:08:13.610
What was it then?

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.753
Engineering building?

00:08:17.055 --> 00:08:22.785
No, it housed, when I came there, it housed chemical engineering.

00:08:23.446 --> 00:08:24.968
Petroleum had already moved out.

00:08:26.652 --> 00:08:29.135
And it was just called the geology building.

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:29.355
Oh.

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:34.081
If you notice in the front, it just says geology and petroleum engineering.

00:08:34.101 --> 00:08:34.281
Okay.

00:08:35.423 --> 00:08:39.888
The reorganization of geosciences occurred when?

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:44.113
The creation of geosciences.

00:08:45.535 --> 00:08:49.420
Well, the 2000 committee is what it was called, I believe.

00:08:50.108 --> 00:09:10.510
I think their report dates from about 1964, but it was another year or so before they hired Horace Byers, a noted meteorologist, a member of the National Academy of Science as dean, and Earl Cook as associate dean.

00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:18.158
And Earl had the responsibilities for geology, geophysics, and geography hiring, whereas

00:09:18.847 --> 00:09:38.650
And so when you arrived in 67, the College of Geosciences already was a reality, and the department was already administratively a part of that group.

00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:45.158
I came here as head of the geology and geography department, and immediately was split off.

00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:52.900
Geography, Ed Duran was the only surviving tackling member at that time.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.281
Skip Schlesselman.

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:53.821
Schlesselman.

00:09:54.963 --> 00:09:56.865
But he retired.

00:09:56.885 --> 00:10:01.031
So Ed Duran took over the hiring in geography.

00:10:02.713 --> 00:10:09.121
Did the department have the authority at that point to give graduate degrees, the geology department?

00:10:09.862 --> 00:10:12.366
Yes.

00:10:12.426 --> 00:10:13.407
Because one of the first...

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.873
when I came here with a PhD.

00:10:19.616 --> 00:10:22.019
So the whole, I don't know when they were instituted.

00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:30.890
Do you remember anything about the comparative number of majors, students majoring in geology at that time?

00:10:31.311 --> 00:10:33.854
I can remember only the graduate students a bunch.

00:10:33.874 --> 00:10:34.415
About how many?

00:10:35.236 --> 00:10:35.636
11.

00:10:39.521 --> 00:10:43.326
Two of them actually not in residence, inactive.

00:10:46.242 --> 00:10:48.645
You must have come down for an interview visit.

00:10:48.946 --> 00:10:49.707
Yes.

00:10:49.727 --> 00:10:55.314
What was your impression of the campus and the community on that first visit?

00:10:57.257 --> 00:10:57.878
That's hard to say.

00:10:57.978 --> 00:10:58.919
I was impressed.

00:10:58.939 --> 00:11:08.052
It was an academic atmosphere and a beautiful campus with the live oaks and so on.

00:11:08.072 --> 00:11:10.555
Physically, that was pretty nice.

00:11:10.575 --> 00:11:12.297
All the buildings, of course, were old.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.642
That didn't impress me that way.

00:11:16.448 --> 00:11:22.138
until I lived in the geology building several years.

00:11:22.158 --> 00:11:31.655
My impression was that it had the potential, with enough money that had been put into it, it had the potential to be a great university.

00:11:31.675 --> 00:11:38.147
Did you meet either vice president or the president then on that visit?

00:11:38.908 --> 00:11:40.110
I met Andy Suttle.

00:11:41.525 --> 00:11:48.736
What was your impression of Dr. Suttle?

00:11:49.697 --> 00:11:53.042
This is the vice president for research we're talking about.

00:11:54.885 --> 00:11:57.089
Did he attempt to interview you?

00:12:06.423 --> 00:12:09.928
What was your first impression of him when you did meet him?

00:12:10.769 --> 00:12:13.593
He didn't have any time to spend with me, actually.

00:12:13.834 --> 00:12:30.460
I had made an appointment at his request to come and see him, and at the time I got there, sitting there waiting for him to give me an audience while he was rushing around, phone calls, papers, and so on, excited about something.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.064
I never did get to really talk to him.

00:12:35.052 --> 00:12:37.796
Okay, you come in and begin.

00:12:37.856 --> 00:12:43.844
What were your personal goals for the department as you become the new department head?

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:53.618
Well, I inherited that, of course, from Earl Cook.

00:12:53.638 --> 00:12:59.727
Earl Cook was going to build a good department that had good research and good teaching.

00:13:01.141 --> 00:13:12.224
to double or triple a faculty almost immediately, or accomplish this without firing, I should say, any of the existing faculty.

00:13:12.244 --> 00:13:18.357
And so I saw it as a real opportunity to be in on the building.

00:13:21.121 --> 00:13:23.604
He asked me my salary, $20,000.

00:13:23.764 --> 00:13:24.525
Yeah, you mentioned that.

00:13:24.545 --> 00:13:30.072
It turned out that year of consulting, I netted, because I lived on $22,000.

00:13:30.152 --> 00:13:36.459
So I actually took a 10% cut and cut me down.

00:13:36.479 --> 00:13:43.908
But that wasn't important to me at the time, because neither was tenure or anything else that we didn't have.

00:13:43.928 --> 00:13:47.492
My interest was getting in an academic environment.

00:13:47.512 --> 00:13:50.976
I had worked for so many people preceding 16 years

00:13:51.327 --> 00:13:55.491
It didn't bother me a bit.

00:13:55.511 --> 00:13:55.952
I've been here a year.

00:13:55.972 --> 00:13:56.732
If they didn't like it, I walked away.

00:13:56.752 --> 00:14:03.379
But you thought at that time you were making a lifetime career change toward academia?

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.842
Yes.

00:14:07.683 --> 00:14:08.103
Okay.

00:14:10.406 --> 00:14:15.651
Describe how you led the department upward, forward.

00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:20.035
Who were some of the first key appointments and so forth?

00:14:20.757 --> 00:14:29.793
Well, first thing, let me say that what I did was I took over all the department business.

00:14:29.813 --> 00:14:40.352
I know the academic environment required or used committee structure, but I decided that wasn't the way I was going to learn the department.

00:14:41.108 --> 00:14:53.285
Fortunately, I had Mrs. Gladys Byers, who worked for the department for about thirteen years, and she knew what a form 500 was, and I had no idea what a form 500 was.

00:14:53.305 --> 00:15:00.214
And of course, there are flurries of those forms going around every fall.

00:15:00.235 --> 00:15:09.968
So, I depended on her to make out all the forms and submit them in a timely fashion.

00:15:11.517 --> 00:15:15.361
Peter Groot was in oceanography at the time.

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:17.063
He was a great help.

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:23.291
He came over and showed me how I should view the academic budget.

00:15:23.311 --> 00:15:24.172
He was very nice.

00:15:24.192 --> 00:15:28.376
Describe this man, Groot, whom both you and I know well, but describe him.

00:15:29.778 --> 00:15:32.982
He was an accountant type.

00:15:33.002 --> 00:15:35.905
His business degree was from Europe.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:49.858
And I think he'd been in the Dutch Air Force at one point.

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:59.071
I don't know.

00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:00.634
No, I don't believe so.

00:16:00.674 --> 00:16:05.841
Yeah.

00:16:07.424 --> 00:16:17.697
You know, at the time, in Calhoun's office, when we had both been doing a lot of business and trying to help the research and trying to help .

00:16:26.948 --> 00:16:32.134
According to the state purchasing, you had to get three bids and all that.

00:16:32.715 --> 00:16:35.338
Well, a winch or something went out on the ship

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.793
when they were near the Panama Canal.

00:16:39.055 --> 00:16:43.741
And of course, they couldn't get three bids and go through the state purchasing.

00:16:43.902 --> 00:16:47.527
So Peter said, oh, let me take care of this.

00:16:47.547 --> 00:16:59.704
And so he went over to the Research Foundation and got about $4,000 in traveler's checks, flew down there, bought the winches, installed them on the ship, and went out.

00:16:59.724 --> 00:17:05.612
So he was doing things like that all the time to facilitate the research in New York.

00:17:07.128 --> 00:17:15.119
As you begin to add to the faculty, who were the key additions at first?

00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:34.725
Well, actually, six months before I got here, middle of 66, Earl Cook had already hired Tom Tia, who was a mineralogist, and David K. Davies, who was a young Welshman, very energetic.

00:17:34.745 --> 00:17:35.987
So we started out with them.

00:17:36.541 --> 00:17:45.033
and those junior faculty members, and they were, turned out to be very good.

00:17:45.053 --> 00:17:47.256
And let's see, who else?

00:17:47.276 --> 00:17:52.563
Well, Earl wanted instant recognition in research.

00:17:52.583 --> 00:18:00.574
So he knew of the rock mechanics work with the geologic applications being done by Shell Lab.

00:18:01.229 --> 00:18:13.283
And this was John Hand and his associates, Mel Friedman, John Logan, George Sowers, Dave Starnes.

00:18:13.303 --> 00:18:23.694
At the same time, that research group was being broken up and shipped off into different places, and they didn't like that.

00:18:23.715 --> 00:18:30.342
Because they had hired on Michelle to do the research, and not to do operations.

00:18:31.452 --> 00:18:44.164
Immediately there was this opportunity then to hire the whole group, bring them up here, and have the instant recognition that A&M was the watch mechanic's place.

00:18:44.365 --> 00:18:45.726
And it worked.

00:18:45.746 --> 00:18:47.007
About when did that occur?

00:18:47.027 --> 00:18:47.948
1967.

00:18:47.968 --> 00:18:48.208
Oh.

00:18:48.228 --> 00:18:53.514
And the whole bunch came at the same time I did.

00:18:53.534 --> 00:18:58.118
He said, Earl Cook was doing that hiring, so I didn't do watching geology.

00:19:00.663 --> 00:19:06.970
And you all were not, space wasn't a problem at that point.

00:19:08.051 --> 00:19:09.753
No.

00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:10.513
Where did this?

00:19:10.573 --> 00:19:11.815
Yeah, it was a problem.

00:19:11.835 --> 00:19:22.366
I think we had our first remodeling in the summer of 67.

00:19:22.386 --> 00:19:22.826
Pardon me.

00:19:22.846 --> 00:19:28.172
Where did the money for these new faculty, do you know where they found that money?

00:19:29.873 --> 00:19:30.634
I forgot.

00:19:31.915 --> 00:19:37.321
I know the first year, they got $500,000 for new machines.

00:19:38.542 --> 00:19:43.207
That is rigged, tri-axial compression machines.

00:19:43.227 --> 00:19:53.919
The reason they had to build their machines right away was that a former student by the name of Ron McAdams, you ever heard of him?

00:19:53.939 --> 00:19:55.240
He was the Shell president.

00:19:56.182 --> 00:19:58.865
He was Vice President of Exploration at the time.

00:19:58.885 --> 00:20:03.509
He was President of Shell Development Laboratory.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:10.516
And he had been mad at me.

00:20:10.536 --> 00:20:12.758
He was a graduate of A&M in 1938.

00:20:13.399 --> 00:20:25.210
He'd been mad at A&M ever since Gilchrist fired Charles Lawrence Baker as head of geology in 1938.

00:20:25.713 --> 00:20:50.324
Well, did he let the, did he allow that machinery to move up here?

00:20:50.724 --> 00:20:50.784
No.

00:20:50.804 --> 00:20:51.585
Oh, he still didn't?

00:20:53.908 --> 00:20:55.450
So that first 500,000

00:20:56.392 --> 00:21:10.714
You know, I don't know, I can't remember.

00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:13.759
Within a couple of years, of course, they had big news.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:20.669
And I'm assuming that these salaries were competitive in terms of the market at that time or they wouldn't have come.

00:21:23.333 --> 00:21:26.098
That's what, which was certainly in high cotton then.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:40.700
Were there any, do you remember any snafus or now amusing events of those early months?

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.042
No, I read not at all.

00:21:42.663 --> 00:21:45.166
Okay.

00:21:45.186 --> 00:21:55.078
As far as you know, whose idea was it to upgrade, strengthen geology at that time?

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:56.941
Cook?

00:21:59.524 --> 00:22:00.245
From Hell Booty.

00:22:02.287 --> 00:22:07.794
From Hell Booty.

00:22:07.814 --> 00:22:08.715
Because he pushed for organizing the college.

00:22:08.735 --> 00:22:08.835
Okay.

00:22:08.855 --> 00:22:09.757
And bringing all the earth sciences together.

00:22:09.777 --> 00:22:10.898
And, of course, our...

00:22:14.438 --> 00:22:25.585
I think the impetus came from Cow Booty originally.

00:22:26.387 --> 00:22:32.481
They hired a good man though, Forrest Byers, because he was well known and well respected.

00:22:34.064 --> 00:22:43.818
And then he became vice president for academic affairs, and Cook became the dean of geosciences.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:51.229
So that the...

00:22:52.863 --> 00:23:02.780
so that there was continuity of support at the upper level for the geology department.

00:23:04.183 --> 00:23:11.395
Now the lab space was also in what is now the Hal Booty building now named

00:23:11.375 --> 00:23:12.676
It's still in the basement.

00:23:12.696 --> 00:23:21.604
All right, so that you all had offices and research facilities in the same building.

00:23:22.705 --> 00:23:26.768
Yeah, what happened, we had to move out chemical engineering.

00:23:26.788 --> 00:23:36.096
I don't remember where they went, but none of the present big engineering buildings were there.

00:23:36.116 --> 00:23:38.999
So chemical engineering went someplace.

00:23:39.019 --> 00:23:40.420
They were only here a couple years.

00:23:41.412 --> 00:23:55.248
Were there, in those early years of this growth and progress, were there some important breakthroughs in terms of research funding and or discoveries, publications by anybody in the department?

00:23:57.351 --> 00:24:04.239
Well, of course, the Center for Tectonal Physics is the rock mechanics lab.

00:24:04.259 --> 00:24:10.947
We were in business very shortly and had a backlog of experiments and so on.

00:24:11.905 --> 00:24:20.013
They started writing them up, and the publication stream was maintained.

00:24:20.033 --> 00:24:25.218
And John Handen was primarily the money raiser.

00:24:25.238 --> 00:24:36.250
He got on national committees and recommended certain experiments to be done, and then he ran back here to do those experiments and so on.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:41.575
So that very cozy relationship lasted quite a while and sustained.

00:24:42.078 --> 00:24:50.330
But one thing happened.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:57.661
People around the country were so impressed on the results of this rock mechanic that everybody started building on it.

00:24:58.943 --> 00:25:06.454
And pretty soon, what A&M did, they couldn't keep up with individuals around the country who did many other things.

00:25:06.474 --> 00:25:08.136
Maybe there were 20 of them after that.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:26.553
So everything that was new and different about rocket mechanics at that time was immediately copied and took away from the reputation of A&M.

00:25:26.714 --> 00:25:33.363
And you as the new department head, what kind of research were you doing in the late 60s, early 70s?

00:25:37.409 --> 00:25:39.372
Or was there any time?

00:25:39.622 --> 00:25:43.387
Yeah, there was plenty of time.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:53.542
I turned out at least two-fifths of a year because that was the academic way of doing things.

00:25:54.423 --> 00:26:03.857
In 1967, in the summer, I read that two friends of mine were developing a big field.

00:26:04.732 --> 00:26:08.535
in southeastern Montana called the Bell Creek Field.

00:26:08.655 --> 00:26:13.139
Hopefully they could use 120 million barrels of water.

00:26:13.159 --> 00:26:21.627
So I called them up and said, you got any cores for the reservoir?

00:26:22.127 --> 00:26:24.469
Oh yeah, we got cores.

00:26:24.489 --> 00:26:27.031
This was a big, big field area and they had eight or ten cores.

00:26:27.051 --> 00:26:30.374
So I said, why don't you send them down here and we'll start working on this.

00:26:30.554 --> 00:26:32.136
I'd like to work on the reservoir now.

00:26:32.156 --> 00:26:32.496
So that started.

00:26:32.516 --> 00:26:33.777
I went and worked closely with David K. Davies.

00:26:34.465 --> 00:26:41.754
Dye Davies, I don't remember his name.

00:26:41.774 --> 00:26:42.494
And he was petrarchal.

00:26:42.515 --> 00:26:54.328
And we published several papers on the Bell Creek Field, which I think impressed people in Rocky Mountain particularly.

00:26:54.349 --> 00:26:54.789
That we did good work.

00:26:54.809 --> 00:26:55.630
We did reasonable work.

00:26:58.917 --> 00:27:15.540
During those years as you were dreaming of the department and its reputation growth was there any institution or number of institutions that you kind of were looking at as a model for A&M to compete with?

00:27:21.288 --> 00:27:21.348
No.

00:27:21.368 --> 00:27:26.916
Who were the other great geology programs in the country?

00:27:28.094 --> 00:27:41.013
And very few academic people were doing any kind of oil business research.

00:27:41.033 --> 00:27:52.971
And the reason was, in 1966, 67, hiring was at an all-time low, about the

00:27:53.845 --> 00:28:04.757
Unfortunately, a lot of academic geologists then turned on the industry and said, no, we aren't going to have anything more to do with it.

00:28:04.777 --> 00:28:11.105
They cut the ties that they've developed over the years.

00:28:11.125 --> 00:28:22.738
And that was the wrong thing to do, because we started publishing and started getting money for research grants, not from the federal government, which a lot of research is supporting.

00:28:23.107 --> 00:28:42.965
During that period, what would have been the normal breakdown of the funding for a typical faculty member?

00:28:43.746 --> 00:28:50.532
What percentage from institutional money, research money, etc.

00:28:50.132 --> 00:28:50.532
?

00:28:52.942 --> 00:28:54.644
That's a tough question.

00:28:56.045 --> 00:29:02.352
The reason is, you see, in those, at the beginning there, I had nothing to do with the research itself.

00:29:03.414 --> 00:29:11.022
Technophysics handled their own research, of course, through the Research Foundation, which facilitated the spending of money.

00:29:13.225 --> 00:29:20.873
And many of us, Davies and myself and Tom Thiel, we all acted as individual entrepreneurs.

00:29:21.224 --> 00:29:31.420
But was the department getting about half of its funding in research?

00:29:34.906 --> 00:29:37.850
Well, at least all summer salaries were paid.

00:29:37.871 --> 00:29:38.151
Okay.

00:29:42.899 --> 00:29:43.840
Outside of that, I don't know.

00:29:45.743 --> 00:30:14.890
the total state budget i had to work with was pretty modest 300 000 or something like that of course these days that would be what three minutes but that didn't pay summer salaries we had a headcount faculty approaching maybe 30. but many of those people not for the whole time

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:23.865
Let's see.

00:30:24.166 --> 00:30:26.290
Let's go to staff.

00:30:26.871 --> 00:30:28.795
You mentioned the key lady a while ago.

00:30:28.835 --> 00:30:34.245
Who were the key staff people that kept the department ticking?

00:30:36.858 --> 00:31:05.228
Describe Mrs. Byers' duties.

00:31:06.507 --> 00:31:11.932
to the department head, and so she did all the paperwork.

00:31:11.952 --> 00:31:14.895
Describe the manner of her personality and style.

00:31:24.123 --> 00:31:35.434
Can you share with this machine any anecdotes where she pulled some fat out of the fire or helped avoid some important mistake?

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:43.956
but I'm sure that there were things that if she hadn't done them, it would have been hell.
