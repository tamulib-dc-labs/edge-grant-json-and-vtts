This

00:04.132 --> 00:27.085
is Friday August 18th Had the pleasure and honor of 
chatting with Noel Parsons, who is soon to leave

00:28.027 --> 00:40.011
the Texas A&M Press to become director of the Texas 
Tech Press. Noel, to introduce yourself to

00:40.835 --> 00:53.609
someone who might listen to this tape in the future 
or read the transcript, describe your background

00:40.835 --> 00:53.609
before you came to A&M. Where did you grow up, what 
did mom and dad do, high school, college,

00:53.669 --> 00:59.455
experience before coming to A&M? I grew up in East 
Central Oklahoma. I was born in Holdenville and

01:02.719 --> 01:10.487
grew up there and in Ada and Wewoka. graduated from 
high school and we woke up and So I was I was pretty

01:10.771 --> 01:31.894
much bound to to that part of Oklahoma and So when 
the time came for me to choose a college I Decided to

01:10.771 --> 01:31.894
go to the University of Oklahoma. I really admired 
their football team so I went there to school and I

01:40.015 --> 01:46.625
Graduated from there in 1964 and had a commission 
through ROTC in the Air Force. Went into the Air

01:47.366 --> 01:49.269
Force for four years. And then when I got out, I 
decided that I wanted to do something that would

01:50.330 --> 01:58.482
make some money. My first major had been in Russian 
language, and so I didn't figure that was

02:09.597 --> 02:12.420
something I could convert into dollars. So I 
decided when I was going to go back to graduate

02:12.500 --> 02:19.427
school, I was going to major in something that I 
could use as a profession. And so I selected

02:20.808 --> 02:22.650
journalism. And I thought that after about a year 
of journalism school, I decided I didn't want to do

02:24.512 --> 02:31.860
newspaper work. I wasn't cut out to be a reporter. I 
could do it, but I didn't really enjoy it. So I went

02:38.082 --> 02:45.153
to my graduate advisor and asked him what I could do 
with a journalism degree that didn't involve

02:38.082 --> 02:45.153
newspapers. And he said, well, there's always 
magazines or books. An aunt of mine had just

02:51.282 --> 02:55.188
written a book and had it published. And I thought 
there was some mysterious process involved where

02:56.309 --> 03:06.064
you had to go to New York City and get involved in the 
publishing business there. So I asked him, you

03:06.837 --> 03:12.466
know, how can I get involved in the book business? 
It looked attractive. It looked interesting. And

03:16.092 --> 03:23.303
I'd always enjoyed reading books, and my aunt's 
experience had been a positive one. So he told me

03:24.285 --> 03:28.972
that the University of Oklahoma Press had a 
fellowship program. At the time, they were

03:29.874 --> 03:33.199
selecting two graduates a year. to go through a 
year-long program of learning the publishing

03:33.770 --> 03:39.539
business there at the University Press. And that 
sounded good, so I applied for that, and I got it.

03:44.646 --> 03:47.831
And I've been in this business ever since. Now, the 
director at that time was in? The director was

03:52.180 --> 03:56.024
Shaw,

03:52.180 --> 03:56.024
Ed Shaw. And Savoy Lawtonville had just retired 
the year before. Savoy Lawtonville was the real,

03:59.768 --> 04:06.175
he was the archetype of university press 
directors. How's his last name spelled?

04:08.057 --> 04:10.600
L-O-T-T-I-N-V-I-L-L-E.

04:12.322 --> 04:13.203
I believe that's it. But I got there a year too late 
to work under his supervision, although he was in

04:14.264 --> 04:21.732
and out a lot, and I did meet him. But Ed Shaw was the 
director. Mary Stith was the managing editor, one

04:26.283 --> 04:35.752
of the old-time by-the-book editors, just a 
wonderful person and wonderful editor. So I was

04:36.353 --> 04:37.854
trained under her. And did that for a year, and then 
I got a job with a publisher in Detroit that

04:39.095 --> 04:51.887
published books for the manufacturing industry. 
Worked there for about two and a half years, then

04:52.728 --> 05:00.016
went to the University of Illinois Press for two 
and a half years, and then came here. And that was

05:01.158 --> 05:02.019
what year? It was 1975. 1975. I started, we moved 
here August 18, 1975. As a matter of fact, 25 years

05:09.347 --> 05:13.412
ago today. Exactly. What a coincidence. I hadn't 
thought about that. How did you and A&M become

05:17.316 --> 05:21.621
linked up?

05:23.255 --> 05:38.229
Well, I had that job at Illinois, and the director 
there who had hired me, Dick Wentworth, had told me

05:23.255 --> 05:38.229
when I started there he couldn't pay me very much. 
And so he was really encouraging me, but they

05:38.690 --> 05:46.497
didn't have a big budget for an assistant editor. 
So he was encouraging me to look. for jobs

05:49.681 --> 05:55.788
elsewhere, and I really did want to give back to the 
South or the Southwest if I could. And so Diggs said

05:56.929 --> 06:18.313
one day, he said, let's go to the Association of 
American University Press' convention, which is

05:56.929 --> 06:18.313
being held in Indiana this year, and you can go with 
me and we'll camp in the state park there and go to

05:56.929 --> 06:18.313
the meetings. And he said, There's someone there I 
want you to meet. This is a fellow. He was the

06:23.124 --> 06:28.069
director of the University of Texas Press for a 
number of years. And he's starting a new press in

06:28.450 --> 06:33.415
College Station at Texas A&M University. And 
he'll be looking for a staff for that press. And so

06:38.201 --> 06:41.264
he introduced me to Frank Wardlaw. Well, Mary 
Stith was at that meeting, too. And she had also

06:45.672 --> 06:55.923
advised Frank that he needed to talk to me, that I 
was a person that might fit into his plans for the

06:45.672 --> 06:55.923
staff here. And so Frank and I got together and went 
to his room in the hotel where the convention was

06:56.924 --> 07:04.792
being held there. And the first thing he did was ask 
me if I wanted a cigar. And he pulled out a big old

07:09.136 --> 07:12.540
black cigar. Fortunately, I was a smoker at the 
time, so that wasn't so bad. Then he poured me a big

07:16.354 --> 07:30.512
stiff bourbon, and we sat in his room and talked 
about his ideas for what he wanted for the staff

07:16.354 --> 07:30.512
here and what I was planning to do.

07:33.455 --> 07:38.241
So we came to an agreement, and he hired me. Well, he 
actually, at that time, he invited me to come to

07:39.503 --> 07:45.812
College Station and take a look at the place. And 
this would have been in early 75? That was in June of

07:47.374 --> 07:49.116
75. This all happened pretty quickly. As you 
recall that conversation with him, what did it

07:51.600 --> 08:03.216
seem that he was emphasizing about your task and 
about the press? Well, Frank was... Frank was...

08:08.613 --> 08:10.275
very task-oriented person. Everybody on the team 
had a task, and all those tasks fit together to

08:11.416 --> 08:19.206
accomplish the publication, to accomplish the 
goal. And so he wanted someone to be the in-house

08:20.527 --> 08:28.277
copy editor, and that's what he hired me to do. And 
that's what I did. And later he let me do a little

08:37.891 --> 08:43.037
acquisition, but he was mainly the acquisitions 
editor. Margaret Ingram was the managing editor,

08:43.597 --> 08:51.166
and she did some copy editing too, and then later on 
she did a little acquisitions too. But until Lloyd

08:52.347 --> 08:59.855
Lyman came in as director, I really wasn't 
involved that deeply in acquiring books. Did he,

09:00.636 --> 09:05.181
in that first conversation, did he give you any 
do's and don'ts?

09:07.726 --> 09:11.991
any guidelines that he expected for you and for the 
press?

09:16.056 --> 09:20.100
No, I don't think he did. He just, he told me what he 
wanted to do here at Texas A&M, and he told me about

09:20.120 --> 09:33.936
all the support he had from the Aggies and the 
university.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.388
But we really didn't go into specifics like that. 
He had heard that I was a good copy editor. I had Mary

09:45.438 --> 09:54.472
Stith's recommendation, which was really the 
best thing I could have had at the time, and Dick

09:45.438 --> 09:54.472
Wentworth's recommendation, too. So I think he 
went on that, and we just talked generally about

10:02.823 --> 10:06.667
the university and living in Texas and that kind of 
thing. Did he give you any understanding of what

10:07.067 --> 10:18.498
topical areas, subject areas, he hoped to 
emphasize with the A&M Press? Well, yeah, he did

10:19.219 --> 10:30.670
say that he did talk about the regional nature of 
the press, but he talked about the fact that he

10:31.342 --> 10:42.915
hoped to do some things in publishing regional art 
that he hadn't been able to do at the University of

10:31.342 --> 10:42.915
Texas Press. He alluded to some of the problems 
he'd had at Texas, but at that time I was young and

10:43.536 --> 10:55.489
naive and I really didn't pay that much attention 
to the political pressures that he'd been under.

10:55.729 --> 10:59.874
Did he talk about number of books, titles a year he 
hoped to do? Yes. that the press was going to

11:01.835 --> 11:07.603
publish 18 to 20 books a year, and he hoped to keep it 
at that level. He didn't want it to go much beyond

11:07.924 --> 11:22.965
that or much under that, because he wanted to 
publish really top-rate books, a few of them, so

11:07.924 --> 11:22.965
that the staff could really concentrate on doing a 
good job on all of them. It's a good philosophy. I

11:26.859 --> 11:28.380
wish we could have continued that. Did he say 
anything about where the press reported and to

11:28.741 --> 11:33.326
whom he was responsible? I

11:33.867 --> 11:41.516
don't recall at that time that we discussed that, 
that he talked about that. I will tell you that

11:42.057 --> 11:51.568
after I came here and started work here, I was 
tremendously impressed because the first day I

11:42.057 --> 11:51.568
was here, practically, the first or second day, he 
took me over to meet Jack Williams in Jack's

11:52.426 --> 11:58.433
offices. And we sat down with the president of the 
university, president and chancellor of the

11:58.453 --> 12:09.586
university, and talked about publishing in the 
press. And my hair was a little longer then than it

12:09.766 --> 12:15.132
is now. And Jack commented on how maybe I'd want to, 
get my hair cut so I'd fit into the looks of the

12:20.928 --> 12:25.434
community. And then Jack also made some comments 
about, I told him I was from the University of

12:25.554 --> 12:41.717
Illinois Press, and he made some comments about 
marijuana smoking at some of the eastern

12:25.554 --> 12:41.717
universities. But it was actually, it was a 
wonderful meeting and I really was totally

12:51.674 --> 12:58.583
impressed with the fact that the president and 
chancellor would take the time to meet a junior

12:51.674 --> 12:58.583
editor. Did you get the impression that he knew 
much about presses and was interested in the

12:58.864 --> 13:02.709
press? Yes, oh yes, I did. And he and Frank were

13:03.690 --> 13:17.108
perfectly, seemed to fit each other, complement 
each other perfectly in that way. Frank had the

13:17.797 --> 13:25.948
technical expertise and Jack had the wherewithal 
to see that Frank's ideas and plans were carried

13:17.797 --> 13:25.948
out. Did anybody, did any outsider as you, these 
people that had recommended you and so forth, did

13:25.968 --> 13:37.543
any of them give you any of their opinions about the 
press and about Wardlaw? Oh, just about Wardlaw.

13:40.127 --> 13:43.411
Of course, the press hadn't really been started 
yet. Well, it had been going for about nine months,

13:45.573 --> 13:51.181
eight months, something like that, but hadn't 
produced any books yet.

13:56.788 --> 14:08.003
But Dick and Mary especially, Mary Stith, told me 
that Frank had been one of the top people in the

13:56.788 --> 14:08.003
Association of American University Presses. I 
think he'd been president of the association a

14:08.023 --> 14:15.073
couple of times by that time. And he had, of course, 
developed the University of Texas Press into one

14:15.323 --> 14:26.696
of the top presses in the United States by the 
mid-'70s. And so his reputation was at the top. I

14:33.644 --> 14:44.436
should tell you that at the same time, that same 
summer, at that same meeting, I got an offer from Ed

14:33.644 --> 14:44.436
Shaw. to go back to the University of Oklahoma 
Press as managing editor, which would have been

14:44.635 --> 14:53.783
quite a promotion for me. But I chose Texas A&M for 
two reasons. Frank Wardlaw and the fact that Frank

15:02.992 --> 15:12.060
was able to go to the Association of Former 
Students and find some money to help me move. I

15:12.817 --> 15:16.000
wouldn't have been able to afford the move back to 
Oklahoma. But he found the funds to help us move

15:17.302 --> 15:24.229
from Champaign to College Station. And that 
really was a major factor. But also important was

15:27.392 --> 15:37.102
the opportunity to work with him and work under him 
and see how he ran a press. I'm not going to ask any

15:37.903 --> 15:40.826
other dollar numbers. What was your beginning 
salary? Well, I don't remember. My wife probably

15:44.767 --> 15:56.502
could tell you, but I think it was $12,000, but that 
may be high. I may be thinking of a couple years down

15:56.803 --> 16:00.888
the road. At Illinois, I was only making five or 
six. And when I'd gotten out of the Air Force as a

16:09.365 --> 16:17.916
captain, I was making a lot more than that, and that 
had been seven years before. As you got ready to

16:18.837 --> 16:23.743
move down here, what was your perception of Texas 
A&M before you arrived? What did you think it was?

16:26.146 --> 16:32.454
Well, going to the University of Oklahoma, I had 
some friends, had several friends from Houston. I

16:32.875 --> 16:36.059
used to come down to Houston fairly often. Of 
course, we'd always travel down I-45. And as we

16:39.335 --> 16:49.997
passed this part of the country, my friends would 
always wave over to the right and say, over there is

16:39.335 --> 16:49.997
that Texas A&M where all those Aggies are. And we 
would proceed on down the road to Houston, the

16:50.238 --> 16:56.010
center of the known universe at the time. And so I 
really never had much of an opinion of Aggies. I was

17:03.411 --> 17:06.015
told stories and jokes, of course. But I never 
really knew anybody who'd gone to Texas A&M at that

17:07.197 --> 17:12.785
time. When we came here and visited in July, my 
wife's from Houston and and so we decided to drive

17:17.017 --> 17:22.924
down in July. We stopped in Oklahoma and came on 
down through College Station on our way to visit

17:22.944 --> 17:45.572
her folks in Houston and stopped off with Frank and 
Rosemary and stayed in the apartments there in the

17:22.944 --> 17:45.572
old Board of Directors building through the press 
offices and they showed us around town and and fed

17:46.733 --> 17:52.199
us and we were just really impressed with the 
place. I remember we went over to the Grove and

17:52.940 --> 18:00.067
watched a movie and it was awfully hot. The weather 
was really terrible that summer and we weren't

18:02.150 --> 18:10.118
used to it, having lived up north for five years. So 
it was a memorable experience. As you arrived, and

18:17.480 --> 18:27.330
joined the community and the staff, how did you 
feel you were received by the community and by the

18:17.480 --> 18:27.330
press? Oh, it couldn't have been any better. And we 
felt that all the time we've lived here. This is a

18:35.239 --> 18:42.486
wonderful community and a warm

18:35.239 --> 18:42.486
community. I think they welcome newcomers with 
open arms. no matter where the people come from.

18:48.797 --> 18:49.758
I've always felt that. What about as you were 
received by the press? What about as you began

18:54.405 --> 18:56.128
work? Oh, it was like finding a new family. That's 
the way the press ran. Frank was the patriarch, and

19:04.020 --> 19:09.929
the rest of us were family members. Describe the 
make-believe I didn't know where the press was,

19:14.787 --> 19:15.668
what its quarters were. Describe the quarters for 
the press and then the staff. The press was on the

19:19.914 --> 19:31.511
second floor of the old Board of Directors 
building, which was the old two-story frame house

19:19.914 --> 19:31.511
with the verandas around the front. I don't know 
when it was built, 1912 maybe, 1910, 1912. I've

19:36.739 --> 19:38.802
forgotten now. But it was a beautiful, big, 
sprawling house. and of course it had been divided

19:44.015 --> 20:09.330
up into a lot of rooms for suites really for the 
board members and they would stay there when they

19:44.015 --> 20:09.330
came for meetings and then after they had been 
given their new quarters over in the MSC why the the

19:44.015 --> 20:09.330
building was pretty much empty and when Frank had 
come to to establish the press, that was the place

20:10.272 --> 20:18.948
that he wanted to put the press. So Frank and 
Rosemary lived on the first floor, and then the

20:19.569 --> 20:25.219
second floor was the press offices. And there was a 
stairway in the back up to the second floor. That's

20:29.547 --> 20:34.356
how we got up to the offices.

20:35.382 --> 20:42.469
The front of the building was the main office, 
Frank's office, with a big conference table in

20:35.382 --> 20:42.469
there. And then Margaret's and

20:43.290 --> 20:54.701
Ray Grimala's offices were right outside of that, 
off the lobby. Spell Grimala. G-R-I-M-A-I-L-A.

21:00.527 --> 21:04.731
Ray was the design manager, designer, production 
manager. And he was from Wesleyan University

21:05.673 --> 21:08.516
Press. He'd been there many years, and Frank hired 
him away from him. He was an award-winning

21:11.999 --> 21:20.488
designer, and he was responsible for the look of 
the books and for the first 10 years or more of the

21:11.999 --> 21:20.488
press. And then the business offices were there 
off the main lobby as well. And then you went into a

21:27.455 --> 21:35.123
hallway, and there were some suites down the 
hallway, and I had one of those suites with my own

21:27.455 --> 21:35.123
bathroom. And so I sat up there in the back of the 
building overlooking the Ward Law's backyard

21:36.672 --> 21:51.518
with the trumpet vine flowers growing over the 
trees and the bushes and shrubs, watching the

21:36.672 --> 21:51.518
birds fly. And I could sit there and take a break 
from editing manuscripts. And it was a wonderful

21:57.148 --> 22:00.233
place to work. It was quiet and peaceful. I really 
enjoyed it. What were your personal goals as you

22:04.149 --> 22:06.733
began? Well, my personal goals were to

22:08.115 --> 22:18.950
just to try to develop a career in publishing. I was 
basically copy editing oriented at that time. I

22:22.995 --> 22:28.363
wanted to do some acquisitions and and

22:29.575 --> 22:34.060
grow in the business. But I really wasn't given an 
opportunity to do that at that time. But I was

22:39.387 --> 22:43.652
satisfied doing the job that I did, which was copy 
editing. And in that role, you reported to who?

22:47.296 --> 22:48.678
Margaret Ingram. She was the first managing 
editor. Describe Margaret and her style. Oh,

22:53.023 --> 22:55.687
Margaret was wonderful. She works for the state 
now. In 1981, she left the press and went to law

22:59.056 --> 23:25.283
school and got a law degree and went to work for the 
state legislature

22:59.056 --> 23:25.283
drafting

22:59.056 --> 23:25.283
laws and checking laws for legal accuracy and so 
on. And as far as I know, she's still doing that. She

23:28.546 --> 23:32.431
works in the bowels of the state capitol over there 
in Austin. But Margaret was wonderful and a good

23:33.131 --> 23:36.535
friend. And

23:36.635 --> 23:51.912
she was from

23:36.635 --> 23:51.912
Kilgore, not Kilgore, Gilmer. She was from 
Gilmer, Texas, East Texas, and she has a wonderful

23:52.263 --> 23:59.091
East Texas twang to her voice. Who else was a copy 
editor other than you and her? That's it. We were

24:05.458 --> 24:07.260
the editorial office. We were the editors. All 
right, and so each of you were doing the, to start

24:09.342 --> 24:16.630
off, the eight to ten a year that Frank planned 
to... The 18... I mean 18. 18 a year. To 20? 18 to 20.

24:21.597 --> 24:24.601
We were doing all of the copy editing ourselves. 
And do you remember what was your first, first,

24:25.802 --> 24:28.625
first? My, oh gee. Oh,

24:32.109 --> 24:41.760
I think my first one was in the Montag Oil No, it was 
in the economic series. It was by a fellow named

24:45.386 --> 24:56.777
Kopp, and it was on the NAFTA, not NAFTA, on OPEC and 
the oil crisis. And I believe that was the first

24:58.879 --> 25:02.243
book I worked on here. And I presume that oil was not 
your primary area of emphasis as an

25:09.095 --> 25:14.040
undergraduate, that this might have been off your 
beaten track? Oh, no, but a professional copy

25:14.100 --> 25:17.383
editor can edit anything. Okay. That's one of the 
things I liked about the job, is that there's such a

25:19.245 --> 25:31.717
variety of interesting material to work with, and 
you don't have to specialize in any of it. I really,

25:32.537 --> 25:36.341
I am, I have a single track mind. My mother's always 
told me that. And I'm a jack of all trades. And it's

25:42.454 --> 25:51.987
one of the reasons that I was pleased not to go on a 
complete graduate school, because I didn't want

25:42.454 --> 25:51.987
to get locked into any one thing. Describe how a 
copy editor goes about editing a manuscript

25:52.888 --> 26:02.621
that's been submitted to a university press. 
Well, it's not done the same way. Describe then.

26:08.564 --> 26:12.649
In-house, back then, we would take a manuscript 
and we'd sit down with it. We'd start reading it.

26:13.770 --> 26:16.153
We'd start correcting it and marking it up. And 
after we'd done that, we'd send it to the author or

26:17.114 --> 26:32.933
sit down with the author, if possible, and go 
through it once again and go through every change

26:17.114 --> 26:32.933
that we'd made, especially the major changes, and 
discuss those with the author and work out any

26:17.114 --> 26:32.933
differences. And the corrections and changes 
that we made were all to the Chicago Manual of

26:33.503 --> 26:40.770
Style. And

26:41.190 --> 26:47.776
this was all done in blue pencil on paper. And

26:49.698 --> 27:02.329
so then once we had reviewed the manuscript or the 
author had had a chance to review it, then we

26:49.698 --> 27:02.329
delivered it to production. Of course, working 
with the illustrations and everything else

27:03.068 --> 27:07.835
involved was part of it, too. Of course, nowadays, 
well, it's all done on computer. And I've done some

27:12.363 --> 27:19.113
electronic copy editing, and I can do that, too. 
But of course, like anything that computers are

27:19.193 --> 27:27.046
involved with, some of the glamour is gone, I 
think. Some of the fun of it. In the olden days, with

27:28.568 --> 27:31.152
the blue pencil, Uh, normally you could do, uh, how 
many hundred pages a week? Oh, man. Or a

27:41.531 --> 27:42.112
manuscript. It's been a long time since I've 
thought about those things. Or a manuscript. I, we

27:45.955 --> 27:52.561
could, well, if you figure you'd, we had to do, uh, 
ten manuscripts a year. Okay. So, uh, in about four

27:53.682 --> 28:00.649
or five weeks, we, it would take us four or five 
weeks working pretty much straight through on it.

28:04.017 --> 28:16.900
Of course, then once you had several manuscripts 
copyedited, they were in various stages of

28:04.017 --> 28:16.900
production, so then you had to handle proof on 
them, checking proof, and and working behind the

28:17.403 --> 28:23.290
authors who were checking the proof, and then 
checking their indexes and so on. So it wasn't all

28:23.591 --> 28:31.441
copy editing once you'd gotten started, gotten 
the books into the mill, into the pipe.

28:34.825 --> 28:45.098
So I'd say it'd take three to four weeks to edit

28:34.825 --> 28:45.098
an average-sized monograph. It really varied a 
lot depending on the density of the writing and

28:46.985 --> 29:00.225
the problems involved with it. There must have 
been a comparatively early manuscript you dealt

29:01.407 --> 29:11.822
with that you look back upon as a real important 
early step. If so, what was it? Well, let me tell

29:15.115 --> 29:25.670
you, I was the copy editor for Frank Gould on his 
book, Common Texas Grasses. Now, the press, when I

29:26.451 --> 29:35.123
got to the press, they had already contracted to 
publish and were in the process of publishing his

29:26.451 --> 29:35.123
big book, Grasses of Texas. That had been started 
by the agriculture school. And then when Frank

29:39.989 --> 29:51.524
came, he more or less acquired that from the ag 
school and said, well, why not let the press

29:39.989 --> 29:51.524
publish it and publish it as a university press 
book? But Common Texas Grasses was a condensation

29:52.345 --> 30:02.798
of that book, and that was one that was assigned to 
me for copyediting. So I worked with Frank Gould,

30:02.818 --> 30:08.325
and I went through his manuscript and copy edited 
it pretty thoroughly and thought I'd done a pretty

30:09.149 --> 30:15.116
good job on it. I was really pleased and I always 
enjoyed working with natural history books and

30:15.176 --> 30:27.711
the methodical nature of the material that's 
presented, consistency from one account to

30:15.176 --> 30:27.711
another. And so I had done a good job on that one 
until I sat down with Frank and he informed me that

30:28.732 --> 30:38.464
Webster's The standard dictionary was not the 
standard for botanists to use in the spelling of

30:39.423 --> 30:50.434
grass names. He told me that it was done a certain 
way and we had to have it done for that book. Well,

30:57.140 --> 31:04.848
being a copy editor, I was insistent that we stick 
with Webster's in the spelling of those names. He

31:05.028 --> 31:09.092
was just as insistent that he was right.

31:10.034 --> 31:26.608
So I took the problem to Frank and explained to 
Frank that we had this disagreement, and Frank, in

31:10.034 --> 31:26.608
his very diplomatic way, suggested that I...
