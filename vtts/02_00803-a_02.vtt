WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:12.125
He said, did you know that the public health grades 
have been posted? And I said, no, I didn't know

00:12.205 --> 00:13.186
that. He said, as usual, you made an A. That was his 
first words to me in four years. That man and I

00:20.274 --> 00:27.701
finished at the same time, and then later I found 
out that his license had been suspended. You know,

00:29.283 --> 00:30.544
that's another irony. His license was suspended 
for

00:31.840 --> 00:41.783
unethical practice.

00:47.787 --> 00:51.312
But there are many subtle ways in which 
discrimination is practiced. How about as a

00:51.332 --> 01:01.966
student here, you were probably in your class, you 
were probably, what, there were 30, about 20 or 30,

00:51.332 --> 01:01.966
25 or about that graduated in your class, I would 
say? No, no, we were 64. 64? Oh, yeah, I see. The list

01:07.614 --> 01:08.415
was that long? I read it down and I didn't realize it 
was that long. No, see, in my class, at that time

01:10.258 --> 01:14.824
there were accepting 64 a year, and I told you that 
three had joined us, you see, from a previous

01:16.053 --> 01:32.090
class, so it made 67, but some of them didn't make 
it, see. So, we only finished, I don't remember

01:32.110 --> 01:37.056
exactly, but it seemed to me that we finished with 
about 64 people. Okay, and you were, were you the

01:37.076 --> 01:40.239
only, you were the only Mexican? Oh, absolutely. I 
was the only one for years. Did you feel that you

01:44.791 --> 01:48.855
were treated differently by your instructors? 
No, sir. Not by my teachers. I never experienced

01:52.739 --> 01:55.542
any discrimination from my teachers here.

01:58.645 --> 01:59.946
No. Why do you think that? Why do you think that was? 
Well, I think that my teachers, and when I say my

02:03.490 --> 02:13.920
teachers, I'm talking about Dr. Jaggi, Dr. Turk, 
Dr.

02:16.837 --> 02:34.759
I think that those people represented a special 
breed who had a lot of vision and who could look into

02:16.837 --> 02:34.759
the future and see that there was no place for 
discrimination on a campus such as ours. I never,

02:37.202 --> 02:45.031
from my teacher, I never received any indication 
of discrimination. It was rather Well, from other

02:47.228 --> 02:48.690
departments.

02:51.153 --> 02:53.076
I remember- What do you mean from other 
departments? I remember an English course that I

02:53.376 --> 02:55.278
took. I took an English course under a guy by the 
name of Greer. I'll never forget him as long as I

02:58.963 --> 03:01.867
live. Because- And this was back in 43 or 44? It was 
1943, in January 1943. I had a course- wait a

03:06.953 --> 03:11.299
minute. No, it was in the summer of 1943. Okay.

03:17.080 --> 03:23.849
You see in in high school I graduated third out of a 
class of 207. My grades are extremely high and I was

03:26.173 --> 03:36.607
co-editor of my high school paper so I have always 
scored very high grades in English in

03:26.173 --> 03:36.607
composition. I have written professionally and 
so forth and all of my teachers have praised my

03:47.185 --> 03:48.988
English. But when I got to this guy, Greer, I took 
sophomore English under him. It was English 203,

03:57.121 --> 04:04.013
if I remember correctly.

04:04.033 --> 04:13.969
He used to return my papers unmarked with a D or an F, 
every paper that I turned into. So when I went to him

04:16.565 --> 04:28.061
and I said, look, I'm not going to learn anything in 
this course if you don't tell me what mistakes I'm

04:16.565 --> 04:28.061
making or how I can improve my grade in your course. 
Because you return my papers unmarked. That

04:32.647 --> 04:33.749
doesn't teach me anything. He said, I don't like 
your style. And that's what he gave me. I got a D in

04:40.558 --> 04:45.745
English after I had been a straight-A student in 
English up to that time. As a matter of fact, I saved

04:46.383 --> 04:50.707
those papers. And one time when I was walking down 
the hall of the academic building, I met a former

04:50.727 --> 04:57.433
English teacher of mine. And he said, how are you 
getting along in sophomore English? And I told him

05:03.238 --> 05:04.860
I'm failing that course. He said, my God, how can 
that be? I said, I'll tell you what, I have here in my

05:07.783 --> 05:15.850
notebook a bunch of papers that have been returned 
to me unmarked except for the grade. He said, let me

05:16.825 --> 05:18.206
have him. And he took him with him. And then the next 
time he saw me, he said, if I were you, I'd take these

05:21.029 --> 05:27.476
papers to the head of the English department and 
tell him what this guy's doing to you. Well, I think

05:27.496 --> 05:32.641
of an overt sign of discrimination. Did you take 
those papers? No. No, I didn't take those papers

05:37.346 --> 05:42.191
anywhere because, you know, A&M has a system here. 
You can't beat the system.

05:45.901 --> 05:58.659
A lot of other people have tried, and I'm not going 
to be the first one to stand up against the Board of

05:45.901 --> 05:58.659
Regents or anybody else, because you can't win. 
I'm nearing now

05:59.841 --> 06:06.210
the end of my professional career. I'm eligible 
for retirement.

06:12.359 --> 06:15.503
I feel that my speaking out on this issue would just 
create a hell of a lot of enemies and uh and and not

06:15.955 --> 06:23.063
get anything done. I wrote a letter to President 
Miller warning him that unless this this

06:25.566 --> 06:44.207
university reversed its trends to discriminate 
against Hispanics

06:25.566 --> 06:44.207
that we may be in for some chastisement from the 
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.

06:53.106 --> 07:01.478
And two weeks after I wrote that letter, they sent a 
team from Washington out here to- I never told

06:53.106 --> 07:01.478
Washington anything. As a matter of fact, the 
letter I wrote to President Miller was not sent

07:01.498 --> 07:04.903
through channels. It was sent directly to his 
home. And I called attention to a disproportion of

07:14.039 --> 07:18.347
disproportionate low number of Hispanics 
attending the university. There's 31,000 people

07:18.547 --> 07:20.571
here. Less than 1% are Mexicans in a state that has 
30%. It doesn't make sense.

07:31.410 --> 07:32.332
I want to ask you a question. I had a senior 
administrator at this university tell me last

07:32.432 --> 07:38.443
year that Mexican-Americans have all seen A&M as 
an opportunity to advance and have always

07:39.605 --> 07:53.886
realized that there's no discrimination against 
them and that's why we always have

07:39.605 --> 07:53.886
Mexican-Americans. Like you say, we have a lot of 
Mexican-American Aggie former students who are

07:54.247 --> 08:07.767
quite proud of being former students here and 
obviously you disagree with that. Of course I

08:07.787 --> 08:09.409
disagree with it because uh like I say less than one 
percent of the students are Mexican-American now

08:10.486 --> 08:37.776
those are not my figures they were published in the 
battalion they're items of common knowledge I

08:10.486 --> 08:37.776
saved that article it's I don't know I can't find it 
right now I'm just moving into this office but uh

08:10.486 --> 08:37.776
there were those statistics reveal that uh very 
very few Mexican-Americans in this institution.

08:40.219 --> 08:40.800
I don't know why. I have talked to several people in 
this department about it, and they said, well,

08:42.402 --> 08:50.374
you're distorting, you know, the facts. And I 
asked them, how am I distorting the facts? I said,

08:54.641 --> 09:03.915
because in the first place, if you take all the 
Mexican-Americans in the state of Texas, how many

08:54.641 --> 09:03.915
of them would have the money to send their children 
to college? See, that knocks out a lot of that 30%

09:05.178 --> 09:10.206
figure that you're citing. In other words, very 
few people from minority groups would have the

09:11.669 --> 09:17.758
money to go to college. And out of those that do have 
the money to go to college, well, a lot of them pick

09:19.281 --> 09:27.554
careers that are not offered at A&M. For example, 
law, and they go to the University of Texas. or

09:33.629 --> 10:00.919
where they go to to some university like 
Kingsville A&I or to some other one

09:33.629 --> 10:00.919
but that I don't think that I don't think that that 
is factual I don't think that the number of people

09:33.629 --> 10:00.919
of Mexican-American descent are so destitute 
that they can't send their children to college. I

10:04.154 --> 10:04.795
don't believe that. And then, of course, a logical 
question is why isn't there some sort of a

10:07.098 --> 10:13.066
scholarship program? No, you know, let me give you 
a couple of examples

10:13.086 --> 10:19.695
that I think are significant. People here that 
reject the idea that there's discrimination

10:29.401 --> 10:31.363
against Hispanics. Or very quick to point out that 
several years ago we had a commander of the Corps of

10:32.004 --> 10:39.774
Cadets here from Laredo who was Hispanic. If what 
you say is true, that example there will negate

10:40.274 --> 10:46.822
anything else you say. The guy was so outstanding 
that it would have been difficult to keep him out of

10:47.803 --> 10:57.315
the slot of commander of the Corps. Did you know 
him? No, I didn't. The

11:00.484 --> 11:04.530
name is Gutierrez. I knew him and I knew, of course, 
his father I went to school with.

11:11.120 --> 11:24.180
They came from a very wealthy family, Laredo,

11:11.120 --> 11:24.180
who experienced some very, very hard times 
following the death of their father. But the

11:26.540 --> 11:43.488
example that I wanted to give you was the example of 
McClure, the black student, who came to this

11:26.540 --> 11:43.488
campus and was president of the student body. What 
year was that? Do you remember? A couple of years

11:46.333 --> 11:47.435
ago. I mean, when that guy, he was recruited, I 
think, I don't have any direct evidence of this,

11:54.097 --> 12:03.169
but I feel that he was recruited

11:54.097 --> 12:03.169
because they saw in him a tremendous potential. 
And he was a gifted speaker. As a matter of fact, to

12:11.280 --> 12:20.492
quote Wayne Stark of the Memorial Student Center, 
he said, when they made McClure, they threw the

12:11.280 --> 12:20.492
mold away. He was not exceptional. And as a senior 
at A&M, he delivered three commencement

12:26.059 --> 12:32.828
exercises in this area. Where'd he go? I heard that 
he had gone to Washington to work for Senator

12:37.274 --> 12:42.441
Tower. And I think that you can expect to hear more 
about this fellow on the floor. He's a black. But

12:55.607 --> 13:13.412
you see, my response to some of these allegations 
that blacks and Mexicans or Hispanics don't have

12:55.607 --> 13:13.412
the intellectual capacity to make it through 
here, and I've heard that from people that should

12:55.607 --> 13:13.412
never have told me that. People are in very highly 
placed positions here. Really? That's right. In

13:19.300 --> 13:20.742
the vet school? No. But in the administration? 
Well one of them is a veterinarian, but he's not in

13:25.605 --> 13:31.171
vet school. You heard that from the 
administrators? He told me that in his opinion

13:34.554 --> 13:47.688
blacks didn't have the intellectual capacity to 
be veterinarians. That the only way that we could

13:47.708 --> 13:51.111
have an increased number of blacks as 
veterinarians would be to reduce the admission

13:52.036 --> 13:59.846
requirements so that they would qualify. Of 
course, I don't condone that. I don't advocate

14:05.193 --> 14:06.575
that at all. I think that you could find that the A&M 
could find a respectable number of minority

14:08.117 --> 14:21.655
students if they sought them, if they made some 
legitimate

14:22.850 --> 14:31.561
efforts to seek outstanding students in the 
public schools of Texas and interest them in the

14:22.850 --> 14:31.561
veterinary profession. I believe that we could 
get a much higher number than we have had in the

14:31.581 --> 14:40.371
past. But you see, now you have to recognize one 
outstanding fact in all of this, in all of these

14:40.391 --> 14:50.764
discussions, that

14:54.035 --> 15:09.814
since my resignation as director of the Institute 
of Tropical Veterinary Medicine, I don't have any

14:54.035 --> 15:09.814
any reason anymore for mingling with other 
department members on this campus. And so my

15:10.414 --> 15:21.728
communication now with the rest of the campus has 
been very seriously curtailed as a result of the

15:10.414 --> 15:21.728
fact that I'm not an administrator anymore. I was 
an administrator for for two years.

15:28.977 --> 15:30.399
No, wait a minute, three years. Were you the first 
Mexican-American to be appointed to the faculty?

15:36.027 --> 15:37.389
Of the College of Indian Medicine? Yes. Well,

15:39.432 --> 15:44.159
yeah, I can't answer that question. I think that 
they had one or two others, but they didn't stick

15:44.199 --> 15:49.827
around.

15:52.878 --> 16:02.226
I know that I'm the only full professor who's been 
appointed to the College of Animal Medicine as a

15:52.878 --> 16:02.226
Mexican American. There was another guy who had a 
Spanish surname, but he couldn't speak one word of

16:02.246 --> 16:06.950
Spanish. And so he, you know, he was used as a body to 
indicate that this man was a minority, but he

16:08.551 --> 16:20.822
wasn't. He had a Spanish surname, but That's all. 
He knew no Spanish and he had never been raised in a

16:25.088 --> 16:32.958
Spanish environment. He came from another state 
and so forth.

16:40.106 --> 16:51.640
But I know that if you visit other agencies on this 
campus, you will find reams and stacks of

16:52.295 --> 17:01.949
reference material to contradict everything 
that I had told you, because it's very easy to do

16:52.295 --> 17:01.949
that. But on the other hand, I think it would be 
quite difficult for anybody to say, yes, we do have

17:01.969 --> 17:15.169
a very active recruitment program, and here is the 
evidence right here. We have sent people to

17:15.489 --> 17:17.292
Laredo. We have sent people to Eagle Pass. We sent 
people to Brownsville or McAllen or Kingsville to

17:21.370 --> 17:26.375
find interest in the A&M. I don't have access to any 
such information. I've never sought it. Why don't

17:35.004 --> 17:35.824
we try it? Why don't we have that type of program, do 
you think? I don't know.

17:42.791 --> 17:44.032
I don't know. I know that the people will say, The 
head of the Former Students Association, he's a

17:48.033 --> 17:52.099
Mexican. There's a guy by the name of Fernandez, 
Raul Fernandez. Did you know that? He's head of the

17:59.129 --> 18:01.332
alumni. This year, as a matter of fact, he's 
president, isn't he? Yeah.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.283
It's a one-year, it's elected one-year term, 
right? Yeah. It's a one-year position. What I'd

18:13.529 --> 18:17.635
like to see here is, I would like to see a sincere 
effort you see of recruitment I don't like for

18:18.425 --> 18:48.094
people to try and snow me with figures and papers 
because anybody can do that but what I'm talking

18:18.425 --> 18:48.094
about is I would like to personally see the names of 
people who are on a committee that has designed a

18:49.458 --> 18:59.732
program for recruitment of minority groups to the 
College of Internal Medicine as well as to other

18:49.458 --> 18:59.732
departments within this campus. Have you ever 
become involved in any of it? No. Why not?

19:07.403 --> 19:16.495
Well,

19:07.403 --> 19:16.495
I have for the first time in my life since I, you 
know, The answer to your question is very complex.

19:24.242 --> 19:29.908
I have married a wonderful girl from Michigan. 
She's not Mexican-American. She's Dutch.

19:36.335 --> 19:42.421
My kids are

19:36.335 --> 19:42.421
mongrels. I tell them they're mongrels. They've 
got Spanish blood and Indian blood and I myself am

19:46.732 --> 20:07.378
part Irish and my wife's Dutch and so

19:46.732 --> 20:07.378
I have been in the Army for so long there was no 
opportunity for me to participate viably in any

19:46.732 --> 20:07.378
Chicano movement of any kind. I never joined the 
LULACs and I never been a part of the or the Raza

20:13.478 --> 20:29.294
Unida or anything like this, and being in the Army, 
you know, those political affiliations are not

20:13.478 --> 20:29.294
encouraged more around quite a bit, and really 
don't sink your roots very deep into any

20:13.478 --> 20:29.294
community. But here, I've spent now about 16 years 
of my life here in this area, and I designed, built

20:30.295 --> 20:42.827
my own home here. I have felt many times that to join 
one of these politically active groups would be, I

20:43.769 --> 21:00.747
think, polarizing

20:43.769 --> 21:00.747
people of my ancestry too much. Yet, there's 
several groups that have been very effective in

21:02.308 --> 21:12.679
the

21:13.385 --> 21:24.802
in the effort to enhance the social aspects of the 
lives of Hispanics. And I think the technical and

21:26.805 --> 21:35.397
also the job opportunities have been increased by 
a lot of these groups. Primarily, some of them are

21:35.658 --> 21:40.185
quite militant. Primarily the American GI Forum. 
Yes?

21:47.595 --> 21:48.436
Is this what you wanted? You said you called down. 
This is a heavier suspension. No, I didn't call

21:51.721 --> 21:52.702
down. It must have been Dr. Hellman. I have not 
called you about that, but he's injected those

21:56.007 --> 21:59.612
mice. Well, he did, and nothing happened. No, I 
didn't call. I told him I'd give him a heavier

22:05.357 --> 22:08.062
suspension. Would you give that to him, please, 
sir? His office is dark. I'd be glad to take that.

22:16.657 --> 22:20.604
Should that be refrigerated until the injection 
is made? Yes, sir. We're doing a count on it now.

22:23.950 --> 22:24.391
Okay. But it's a much heavier suspension than the 
previous one. Okay, thank you.

22:34.503 --> 22:38.409
No, that's a good question, you know. Why haven't I 
joined any of these groups? As a matter of fact, I

22:40.371 --> 22:42.795
was just looking before you came over here. One of 
these people or one of these groups wrote me an

22:45.579 --> 22:57.536
invitation here to attend a convention that's 
going to be held in Austin. It's called, let me see,

23:04.338 --> 23:12.748
Something about the Chicanos in Higher 
Education.

23:12.768 --> 23:25.104
The Association of Chicanos in Higher Education, 
they call themselves TACHE, T-A-C-H-E. And

23:12.768 --> 23:25.104
they're gonna have a convention in Austin next 
month. Like I said, I've never joined any of these

23:25.224 --> 23:27.126
groups. It's not because I'm opposed to their 
objectives. But I'm not at all known in the LULAC.

23:39.296 --> 23:41.839
I'm not at all known in the American GI Forum. So I 
felt that it was too late in my professional career

23:43.120 --> 23:55.073
to really make any significant contribution to 
any of these groups since I had never participated

23:43.120 --> 23:55.073
before. So

23:55.093 --> 24:01.961
you decided not to go over to Austin? Well, I have 
not decided. but I have never attended any of their

24:04.244 --> 24:10.011
conferences. I don't even know whether there's 
any active chapter of Thatcher here on this

24:10.031 --> 24:17.340
campus. There must be, but I don't know about it. In 
short, I have not gone out of my way to join any of

24:21.445 --> 24:29.374
these groups who espoused the cause of the Chicano 
or the Latin American or the Hispanic.

24:39.120 --> 24:47.410
Now here in this community, I was the director of 
the Black and White Ball Association in 1978. And

24:48.832 --> 24:49.953
what exactly is that? Okay, the Black and White is 
called the Bryan College Station Black and White

24:50.394 --> 24:57.101
Ball Association. This is an organization of both 
Anglos and Hispanics,

24:58.987 --> 25:23.642
which was formed in the early 30s in an effort to 
bring together people of both backgrounds to see

24:58.987 --> 25:23.642
if they could dispel some of the instances of 
discrimination and really try to understand each

24:58.987 --> 25:23.642
other's culture. And every significant city in 
Texas that is south of here, particularly, has a

25:28.872 --> 25:41.143
local organization. And the objectives of this 
organization, which is a loosely organized

25:42.244 --> 25:54.734
association,

25:42.244 --> 25:54.734
we don't have any ties to any other one. It's just 
organized locally. Ours, for example, is

25:58.960 --> 26:19.708
organized not only to promote better relations 
between the two cultures, but also to give

25:58.960 --> 26:19.708
scholarships to children whose parents are in 
need of some financial assistance.

26:20.890 --> 26:28.680
That is the only reason for the existence of the 
Bryan College Station Black and White Ball

26:20.890 --> 26:28.680
Association. I would like to tell you why the name 
Black and White Ball is introduced. It is not

26:34.463 --> 26:49.840
because of the melanization of a person's skin, 
but rather because of the attire that is

26:34.463 --> 26:49.840
customary or traditional to wear at these 
functions. They hold a dance once a year, and to

26:50.701 --> 26:58.870
this dance is a very formal occasion. and you're 
only permitted to wear either black or white.

27:03.314 --> 27:08.763
Either a black tuxedo or a white tuxedo or a 
combination of black and white. And the

27:10.465 --> 27:26.629
objectives, as I said, our particular 
association exists only to help needy students go

27:10.465 --> 27:26.629
to college.

27:28.027 --> 27:41.809
during my tour as president in 1978, we gave 12 
scholarships

27:28.027 --> 27:41.809
that ranged between four and $500. And this year, 
this last year, 1979,

27:42.210 --> 27:51.405
they gave an equal number of scholarships. So 
that's about $5,000. It's a non-profit

27:54.149 --> 27:56.651
organization. Where do you get the funds? We get 
the funds from several sources.

28:07.402 --> 28:22.317
I think probably the greatest,

28:07.402 --> 28:22.317
the most productive source of funds has been the 
printing of a brochure that is handed out to the

28:22.550 --> 28:24.933
people who have bought a ticket to the dance. And in 
that brochure, it's full of advertisements, and

28:26.095 --> 28:46.163
the local merchants have paid to advertise in 
these brochures, and we have had several hundred

28:26.095 --> 28:46.163
printed up, and that has provided us with the 
greatest source of our income. Also, of course,

28:47.044 --> 28:51.190
the dance itself.

28:52.334 --> 29:01.247
We charge $10 per person, but with this goes a 
breakfast and contributions from people. We have

29:03.190 --> 29:05.273
managed to... When I took this organization over 
in 1978, they had no constitution. They had never

29:11.983 --> 29:18.072
even applied for an IRS tax-exempt status. So they 
were paying taxes? They never paid any taxes

29:21.207 --> 29:24.873
because they had made very little money. Oh, I see. 
You see, the IRS never questioned their receipts

29:28.600 --> 29:42.726
because they were, you know, very nominal, very 
modest, but now when we formed a constitution and

29:43.820 --> 29:52.052
elected officers and spelled out who the officers 
would be and how they would be elected and when the

29:43.820 --> 29:52.052
meeting would be held. You know, a constitution, 
no organization should exist without a

29:52.814 --> 29:59.323
constitution. And then on the heels of that, I 
wrote to the IRS and after filling out a tremendous

29:59.344 --> 30:11.582
number of forms, they granted us tax exempt 
status. And so now, why they recognize the Black

30:12.946 --> 30:38.937
and White Ball Association as being a charitable 
organization that had no desire to make any

30:12.946 --> 30:38.937
profits, is all the money is turned over in the 
spring to those students who have applied for the

30:12.946 --> 30:38.937
scholarships and have been selected by their 
committee. and have manifested some, have

30:39.760 --> 30:56.064
substantiated in some way the fact that they have 
been accepted by an institution of higher

30:39.760 --> 30:56.064
learning, and it's been a very successful 
program. And are these just basically poor

30:57.065 --> 30:58.807
students? Yes, but you see, here's something that 
the Anglo residents of this community have never

31:08.870 --> 31:12.133
taken time out to learn. These scholarships are 
not given only to Hispanics. As a matter of fact,

31:18.720 --> 31:26.027
out of the 12 that were the recipients in 1978, I 
think only one was Hispanic. The rest of them were

31:27.068 --> 31:28.089
Anglos.

31:32.213 --> 31:34.816
And this year, maybe one or two were Hispanics. So 
the recipients of these is not based on on color, or

31:39.667 --> 31:46.380
creed, or nationality, or you see, it's for both 
cultures.

31:49.366 --> 31:55.178
I remember calling the mayor of College Station 
one time and asking him for a country.
