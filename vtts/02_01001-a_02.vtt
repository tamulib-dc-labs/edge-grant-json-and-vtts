WEBVTT

00:05.093 --> 00:12.001
You were saying that you were talking about the 
strategic hamlets. Did you move people into these

00:12.221 --> 00:14.463
villages? No, I never did. The only time I tried to 
move some people was at a camp back in my first tour

00:19.008 --> 00:34.746
and I was told

00:19.008 --> 00:34.746
that we just could not do it. It was a camp, and I've 
forgotten the name of it now, but at one time it had

00:35.435 --> 00:45.432
the third largest or longest and best airfield in 
Vietnam. And the problem was that there were no

00:46.694 --> 00:58.995
people there, that most of the people had fled Q2 
Viet Cong activity. As a matter of fact, it was one

00:59.228 --> 01:06.417
of the largest camps in Vietnam, but there were 
very, very few people there. And it had, prior to

01:06.937 --> 01:15.888
1964, been very heavily populated.

01:18.771 --> 01:20.273
And they had just all fled. And I wanted to move 
people back out there, but there was no existing

01:20.854 --> 01:26.721
road system The road system had been destroyed by 
the VidCon, and primary resupply was by air. And I

01:35.504 --> 01:52.303
had envisioned moving people back into that area, 
those who wanted to come, give them support for a

01:35.504 --> 01:52.303
period of time where they could grow their rice and 
chickens and hogs and what have you. and to

01:52.975 --> 02:04.727
repopulate the area where they can become more or 
less self-sustaining, as well as having a surplus

01:52.975 --> 02:04.727
to assist in feeding the local troops. But I faced 
an insurmountable task in persuading anyone that

02:05.769 --> 02:15.659
it would work. The local government, province 
chief, to repopulate in that area. He felt that

02:27.972 --> 02:38.167
once we had gotten the civilian populace out of 
there, that everyone who remained was VC or VC

02:27.972 --> 02:38.167
synthesizer. Therefore, it was obvious anyone 
there was not friendly, and that was his problem. I

02:49.642 --> 03:17.691
was

02:49.642 --> 03:17.691
sent down from Okinawa

02:49.642 --> 03:17.691
with two other officers to assist the U.S. 25th 
Division in establishing their civil affairs and

02:49.642 --> 03:17.691
asylum program when they came into the country. We 
got there shortly before they did. One brigade was

03:20.788 --> 03:25.393
in second port. I can't recall the name of the area 
where they were.

03:38.425 --> 03:45.231
I traveled out with the

03:38.425 --> 03:45.231
first division, first U.S. division. And 
unfortunately, as I arrived with the 1st

03:46.561 --> 03:54.348
Division, they were going out on an operation. I 
believe it was called Buck's Camp. But their civil

03:57.931 --> 04:12.064
affairs officer had gone to Saigon to become 
educated in the ways and the responsibilities of

03:57.931 --> 04:12.064
civil affairs, psyops, refugee control, and this 
sort of thing. And he was not there, so I didn't

04:16.430 --> 04:26.683
didn't get a chance to talk to him, find out what he 
was doing with his division's programs and what

04:16.430 --> 04:26.683
kind of programs they had. My short visit with 
them, I think, was about two weeks, and I became

04:27.223 --> 04:45.846
rather hands-on involved with refugee control, 
evacuation, feeding, safeguarding, and so forth

04:27.223 --> 04:45.846
during that particular operation. And as a matter 
of fact, we evacuated sort of 1,000

04:46.433 --> 05:13.318
Vietnamese civilians from the Iron Triangle as it 
became known,

04:46.433 --> 05:13.318
the areas where the 1st Division was operating, in 
order to clear out and deny the Vietcong a area of

05:13.535 --> 05:22.464
operations for the civilian populace to hide in 
the area called the Iron Triangle. This was just

05:22.484 --> 05:25.747
after the first major battles in the Iron 
Triangle? This was the beginning of the major

05:25.767 --> 05:33.175
activities within the Iron Triangle, yes. At Chi 
Chi, what was your job? Did you deal with the tunnel

05:38.080 --> 05:42.985
rats? deal with the tunnel wrecks? No, not really. 
I knew the engineers, some of them I knew a few of,

05:48.034 --> 05:58.384
and knew slightly some of the tunnel wrecks in that 
area. As a matter of fact, in our area where we moved

05:59.025 --> 06:09.495
into just north of Coochee, the third gate I 
believe it was the 3rd Brigade of the 25th Division

06:10.927 --> 06:32.125
moved in there in, as I recall, late January or 
early February, I'm not sure of the dates, of 1966.

06:36.509 --> 06:46.422
We found an area there that appeared to be old 
peanut fields that were not being worked at that

06:36.509 --> 06:46.422
particular time. And that's where they decided to 
put the 25th Division. The 1st Division had just

06:53.751 --> 06:58.817
prior to that been operating in that area. But 
there were a couple of villages close by. I'd say

07:04.083 --> 07:06.465
within a half mile. And the village of Coochee 
itself was about three quarters of a mile or a mile

07:07.667 --> 07:16.295
south of that area. And it was not known until 
later, I'm talking about after the war, how

07:16.315 --> 07:26.706
extensive that tunnel system really was. We did 
have tunnels within the area, and as a matter of

07:27.387 --> 07:33.533
fact, They blew up one which was only about 50 feet 
from the absolute inner water where the Tactical

07:34.070 --> 07:47.103
Operations Center for the 3rd Brigade was. And 
this was, it left a fairly good sized hole in the

07:47.583 --> 07:53.969
ground. And of course this was later filled in 
because we hadn't used the space for whatever. And

07:59.895 --> 08:02.878
you want some war stories? What kind of tactics did 
they use to fight? You never fought in the tunnels.

08:09.890 --> 08:12.312
No, I did not go into any of the tunnels. I'm a pretty 
good-sized boy. I just wouldn't fit into them.

08:18.958 --> 08:25.624
Besides that, I have a high regard for my skin, and 
it wasn't my job. I wasn't going into the tunnels.

08:29.408 --> 08:34.232
What kind of tactics did they use to fight in the 
tunnels, if any at all? Primarily, the tunnel rats

08:34.988 --> 08:43.776
went in armed with concussion grenades and .45 
missiles. And they would go into them and go as far

08:43.796 --> 08:55.248
into them as they could go, commensurate with a 
reasonable amount of safety. And usually only two

08:55.548 --> 09:03.055
at a time, as I recall, would go into a tunnel. One to 
lead the way and the other to back him up and pull him

09:03.440 --> 09:11.049
out if he got hurt.

09:11.069 --> 09:13.412
Because the tunnels were very, very small.

09:17.618 --> 09:30.814
As I was told, I was never in one, that for a medium or 
small size American, the most that they could do

09:17.618 --> 09:30.814
would be hands and knees. and it was crowded on the 
sides. Now, I'm sure that there were, and I heard

09:34.340 --> 09:45.239
some of them talk about larger rooms in the tunnels 
that they found. These larger rooms, however,

09:45.419 --> 09:57.139
were not what you call American-sized larger 
rooms or classroom-sized or anything of that

09:45.419 --> 09:57.139
nature, what we would consider They were all very 
crowded and very small scale. Even the larger

10:04.051 --> 10:23.059
rooms probably were not more than 5 or 6 feet in 
height at the very most and maybe 8 by 10, large 8 by

10:04.051 --> 10:23.059
10 feet square. The ones that I was told about. I'm 
sure that from what I have heard since the war was

10:27.244 --> 10:36.758
over that they were, in other places, that they 
were much, much larger. But they had to be much

10:37.279 --> 10:43.228
deeper also than the ones that we were familiar 
with. Most of the ones there were six to ten people

10:43.248 --> 10:52.962
of the service at the most.

10:55.760 --> 11:06.591
After they would crawl in and check them out, they 
would attempt to destroy the tunnel itself by the

10:55.760 --> 11:06.591
use of explosives. And they'd set a large charge of 
explosives down with sandbags and so forth, and

11:06.611 --> 11:23.488
then crawl out detonating it by wire, electrical 
charges. Were you harassed more by guerrillas

11:24.008 --> 11:28.853
here? We did have some,

11:30.034 --> 11:39.343
and I think this is probably one of the tunnels that 
we may have later found. We did have on occasion

11:39.984 --> 11:50.535
sniper fire landing within the inner wire near the 
tactical operations center. I don't believe that

11:54.704 --> 11:59.449
There might have been a couple, three wounded. The 
troops out on the perimeter, the battalions that

11:59.549 --> 12:20.813
were on the perimeter, they did have a 
considerable amount of harassment at night,

11:59.549 --> 12:20.813
small arms fire primarily, and on one occasion, a 
either grenade attack or The mortar attack, I'm

12:21.434 --> 12:24.678
not sure which it was. I was not there at the time. 
But I do know that they did have some small

12:27.642 --> 12:33.149
explosions within the areas. This is perimeter 
troops, battalions that did receive some

12:33.971 --> 12:40.820
harassing fire. And this, of course, was almost 
every night somewhere along the perimeter. You

12:46.167 --> 12:49.551
mentioned other stories about the tunnels. Oh, 
yes, I had a bright idea that we could probably

12:50.881 --> 13:07.001
drown them out, and we had the equipment with us, or 
at least the 25th Division did. They had a

13:07.762 --> 13:19.437
jacuzzi-type water pump, and I'm talking about 
the pumps that would throw a four or six inch stream

13:20.125 --> 13:37.050
of water and we had the aluminum piping similar to 
the manner in which they used the same type of pipe

13:20.125 --> 13:37.050
for irrigation in West Texas years ago. And I had 
what I thought was a bright idea that we could pipe

13:37.731 --> 13:46.183
the water from the river up to one of the tunnel 
entrances and drowned them out. But I was told by

13:52.780 --> 13:59.688
the engineer officer that I spoke to that it just 
wouldn't work. And I had other things to do and just

14:00.549 --> 14:06.116
didn't carry through with it. I think probably 
looking back in retrospect that none of us at that

14:06.817 --> 14:16.069
time knew the extent of the tunnel system. And had I 
known, had we known at the time how extensive it was

14:21.143 --> 14:35.315
and the fact that they were allegedly 
interconnected, that this would have been a

14:21.143 --> 14:35.315
pretty good idea. But unfortunately, it was one of 
those good ideas that,

14:35.835 --> 14:45.904
not knowing the importance of it, I ignored it, 
that they thought they were doing a pretty good job

14:46.222 --> 14:54.995
with the tunnel rats and blowing most of them up and 
denying their use to the Vietcong. And I just let it

14:56.758 --> 14:58.140
slide. Didn't do anything about

14:58.160 --> 15:03.448
it. What was the esprit of the Green Beret in 
Vietnam after the first major buildup?

15:12.882 --> 15:15.165
My experience with the Green Berets, After the 
first major buildup, I was never again with the

15:15.736 --> 15:26.668
Special Forces, other than just visiting on 
occasion. What was their esprit de corps? As far as

15:30.331 --> 15:37.079
I could tell, it was not as high as it had been. They 
were continuing to operate somewhat as they had.

15:44.761 --> 15:50.990
They were going more for, as I recall, long-range 
patrols. They continued to operate their

15:51.250 --> 16:02.407
training camps and continued to work as they 
always had, but were placing more emphasis on

15:51.250 --> 16:02.407
long-range patrols. And as I recall, they were 
operating cross-border patrols into Laos and

16:03.348 --> 16:10.819
Cambodia. to some extent, I think probably more 
into Laos, trying to locate and cut the Ho Chi Minh

16:11.390 --> 16:22.848
Trail. And of course, as we all know, the Ho Chi Minh 
Trail was a number of trails. And as I have learned

16:37.934 --> 16:52.007
Later, it was actually a quarter-way highway in 
many places, protected by bamboo and tree

16:37.934 --> 16:52.007
camouflage. It was a tunnel, above-ground 
tunnel, so to speak, through vegetation in many

16:53.808 --> 17:02.736
places for miles and miles. And I have no idea how 
many man-hours spent building the tunnel, but I do

17:07.955 --> 17:28.566
know that I heard stories from time to time, but I 
was never privy to actually seeing a part of the Ho

17:07.955 --> 17:28.566
Chi Minh Trail as such that I knew what I was looking 
at.

17:29.788 --> 17:36.578
What was the view, what was your view, what was the 
general view of Westmoreland in his search and

17:29.788 --> 17:36.578
destroy strategy?

17:38.954 --> 17:53.208
I

17:38.954 --> 17:53.208
really had

17:38.954 --> 17:53.208
no understanding at that time of what a 
search-and-destroy strategy was. The few

17:53.708 --> 18:07.982
conversations I had with General Westmoreland 
and the few times that I briefed him concerning the

17:53.708 --> 18:07.982
activities of the 25th Division, civil affairs 
and psyops, It appeared that he was a firm believer

18:08.502 --> 18:21.019
in the idea of win their hearts and minds.

18:21.119 --> 18:29.030
To me, he did not appear as bloodthirsty as he's 
sometimes been made out to be. It appeared to me

18:29.911 --> 18:36.720
that

18:29.911 --> 18:36.720
the search and destroyer was search and find the 
VidCon and destroy them. And since

18:41.417 --> 19:00.224
those years it's appeared in publication and 
writings of different types that it was a search if

18:41.417 --> 19:00.224
you don't find anything destroy it type of thing. 
At least this is the impression I gained from the

19:04.223 --> 19:07.387
printed and electronic media at this time. That is 
what was either going on or that's what the

19:07.567 --> 19:15.778
reporters think was going on. I personally did not 
see any destruction of civilian property other

19:17.019 --> 19:29.976
than that which was absolutely necessary. And 
most of the

19:37.315 --> 19:40.960
unfriendly villages were left alone. If they were 
not actively participating in the war, they were

19:41.922 --> 19:52.457
left to do what they wanted to do.

19:52.517 --> 19:56.022
Was there friction between the Special Forces and 
regular forces of the Army? And if so, what was it

19:56.703 --> 19:59.968
about? I'm going to give you one word answer, no. I 
didn't see any friction between them. Now, there

20:05.896 --> 20:07.238
may have been, But I was not privy to any friction. 
The Special Forces that I knew, and I did not know

20:13.502 --> 20:36.482
any in 1966,

20:13.502 --> 20:36.482
the Special Forces camps were not within the areas 
that I operated in 1966 because this was not the

20:13.502 --> 20:36.482
ideal terrain. for the special forces to operate. 
Was there any friction about whose tactics were

20:42.074 --> 20:47.881
right? Should we have been using conventional or 
unconventional tactics against the enemy? Or

20:53.968 --> 20:57.852
what kind of tactics were? I really don't 
understand that question.

21:05.167 --> 21:26.838
You must understand, I think I understand what 
you're asking, but if you're talking about

21:05.167 --> 21:26.838
military tactics per se, the special forces and 
regular forces or conventional forces tactics

21:05.167 --> 21:26.838
are just not compatible. Conventional forces 
primarily were designed and still are designed to

21:26.979 --> 21:34.870
take and hold special forces tactics were 
designed and are still in the unconventional

21:35.204 --> 22:04.435
mode, fighting an unconventional enemy to seek 
out and destroy the base camps, seek out and

21:35.204 --> 22:04.435
destroy their lines of communications, and to 
harass them on their lines of communications. Of

22:04.887 --> 22:17.908
course the conventional forces had to adopt some 
of that in their long range patrols as well as with

22:04.887 --> 22:17.908
their short range patrols. And in many cases they 
put the fairly large forces, large numbers of

22:17.928 --> 22:29.005
troops on their lines of communications.

22:29.710 --> 22:40.941
I'm sure that the regular forces were primarily 
responsible for most of the search and destroy

22:29.710 --> 22:40.941
type operations. We didn't like the term as such 
because it

22:41.062 --> 22:56.157
portrayed a different attitude than that which we 
really had.

22:58.904 --> 23:02.429
We were not there to destroy Vietnam. We were there 
to safeguard the civilian populace and to protect

23:02.449 --> 23:09.800
them. That was our feelings at the time. That was my 
feeling, and I don't believe that I was too far

23:12.784 --> 23:23.359
different from the average soldier I might have 
been. What about the relationships between the

23:26.022 --> 23:32.829
Green Berets and the Vietnamese civil 
authorities during the build-up? And are you

23:32.849 --> 23:38.354
referring to the 1966 era?

23:40.336 --> 23:44.800
Well, I did not wear the Green Beret in 1966. I did 
not want to call attention to myself as a Green

23:44.961 --> 23:52.468
Beret. But

23:53.815 --> 24:10.374
the

23:53.815 --> 24:10.374
civil authorities that I knew were very 
cooperative

23:53.815 --> 24:10.374
with all the military. Now that does not mean to say 
that they were

24:10.394 --> 24:19.745
not looking out for number one. As a matter of fact, 
that was the biggest headache that you saw or at

24:23.937 --> 24:53.337
least that I saw during my entire Vietnam 
experience that the

24:23.937 --> 24:53.337
Vietnamese

24:23.937 --> 24:53.337
civil government at district level it was a 
military government and at province it was a quasi

24:23.937 --> 24:53.337
military government But even so, be they military 
or civilian, they had a tendency, and I hate to say

24:54.599 --> 25:23.779
that they all were, but most of them were

24:54.599 --> 25:23.779
very self-oriented,

24:54.599 --> 25:23.779
meaning that if it was good for their career, if it 
was good for the pocketbook, then by all means it

24:54.599 --> 25:23.779
was good for them. It was good for everybody. But I

25:26.896 --> 25:38.934
would say that by and large, the Vietnamese civil 
government was very corrupt. And

25:38.954 --> 25:43.841
there were many exceptions to that. But 
unfortunately, I ran into a number that proved the

25:45.002 --> 25:50.931
world wrong. They were cooperative. For 
instance, if you had 1,000 sacks of cement to build

25:55.355 --> 26:12.317
a school and it took 1,000 sacks, you better order 
1,500 or 2,000 sacks. That's about the same for any

26:13.799 --> 26:22.791
other commodity, building materials and so 
forth. It just seems that

26:24.712 --> 26:40.515
the corruption was pervasive.

26:40.535 --> 26:44.701
When you left at the end of 66, did you think there 
would be a Tet Offensive?

26:48.186 --> 26:48.947
No. I knew the war was going to be coming to a close 
before tomorrow, and I perceived incorrectly as

26:50.547 --> 27:01.600
it later turned out. I believe the tail of Fancy was 
the tail of 1968, was it not? Yeah, I see. And we're

27:11.772 --> 27:16.217
talking about over a year. At the time I left there 
in 1966, December I believe it was,

27:16.855 --> 27:45.900
it was not a friendly war, but at the same time it 
was, it seemed to be depressing that there was a lot

27:16.855 --> 27:45.900
less activity

27:16.855 --> 27:45.900
other than defensive on the part of the VidCon. I 
believe that the government forces, including

27:48.958 --> 28:04.283
U.S. forces, were pressing right along and with a 
great deal of success. But naturally, there were

28:04.303 --> 28:13.137
incidents where the VidCon did attack. and in most 
cases against sometimes strategic hamlets,

28:14.264 --> 28:23.397
sometimes engraved forces against special 
forces camps. And on infrequent occasions,

28:24.638 --> 28:37.656
primarily in the highlands,

28:24.638 --> 28:37.656
the Viet Cong were able to build up and to operate 
against

28:39.357 --> 28:46.144
U.S. military forces to some extent, but not with 
any great success. As I stated, it was primarily

28:46.164 --> 28:50.608
defensive in nature. Why did you believe the war 
was coming to an end? I believed our own

28:55.893 --> 28:59.216
propaganda. And quite frankly, at that time, the 
NBA had not come down in strength.

29:12.565 --> 29:19.976
There were isolated instances of NDA units, but 
the war was not being fought by NDA. It was being

29:19.996 --> 29:22.720
fought primarily by VidCon.

29:29.251 --> 29:32.736
The infrastructure of VidCon was on the run. Were 
you, again, you were debriefed when you left. Did

29:38.645 --> 29:41.187
anybody listen to what you had to say? Sure. My 
debriefings were incorporated into area studies

29:44.611 --> 29:56.785
that were ongoing within the Special Forces, 
Special Action Force Asia. We're all about

29:57.165 --> 29:59.027
debriefings.

30:02.281 --> 30:15.360
When you left Vietnam in 1966, you eventually 
ended up at Fort Polk to train troops before you

30:02.281 --> 30:15.360
went back again. When you were training troops, 
did you use the experiences in Vietnam to help you

30:15.801 --> 30:26.537
train troops to go to Vietnam?

30:26.557 --> 30:31.444
I used my experience primarily as a 
self-motivator.

30:34.225 --> 30:54.067
to motivate me and my NCOs, officers, to make them 
understand the importance of training the troops

30:34.225 --> 30:54.067
properly.

30:56.069 --> 31:00.053
What did you think of the training process?

31:00.534 --> 31:04.198
I was involved in basic training rather than 
advanced individual training.

31:09.901 --> 31:31.333
In 1967 in Fort Polk, we had the ideal training 
environment, at least as far as we could have it in

31:09.901 --> 31:31.333
an active post within the United States, being 
that it was hot in the summertime. And the humidity

31:31.583 --> 31:40.134
was high, which is the way it is in Vietnam. And we 
began to acclimate our troops, at least the troops

31:41.416 --> 31:49.186
that I had to train. They became rather well 
acclimated to the heat and the humidity during the

31:49.247 --> 31:57.878
summertime.

31:59.950 --> 32:06.319
without having actual jungle to train in, I think 
we did rather well. As a matter of fact, just as an

32:06.359 --> 32:15.272
aside, Vietnam is not all jungle, and Vietnam is 
not all rice paddy.

32:18.616 --> 32:29.772
During a period of time, and I don't recall, I guess 
it was during the 1964, I landed at a dirt airstrip

32:30.005 --> 32:32.288
in C-123. And that, when I got off the airplane, I 
looked around and I felt like I was a little bit of

32:34.171 --> 32:46.328
deja vu. It was like Highland in New Mexico, the 
high-level plains of New Mexico, burnt grass.

32:55.486 --> 33:22.827
cactus, adobe, what appeared to be adobe 
buildings around, and the terrain, short

32:55.486 --> 33:22.827
distance around the airfield and as far as I could 
see at that time, looked like the high mountains or

32:55.486 --> 33:22.827
high plains of New Mexico.

33:33.539 --> 33:44.631
You returned to Vietnam in May 1968 to May 1969 as 
military advisor to the 51st Arvin Regiment, I

33:33.539 --> 33:44.631
Corps near Da Nang. What did you think was the 
result of the Tet? What do you think was the outcome

33:51.919 --> 33:53.961
of the Tet? You're talking about the Tet 
Offensive? The Tet Offensive of 1968. In my

34:01.849 --> 34:03.411
opinion, and I am I'm still a firm believer that 
this was the division between phase one of the

34:03.678 --> 34:20.255
Vietnamese experience and the second phase of the 
Vietnamese experience. I'm talking about the –

34:20.275 --> 34:29.905
prior to this time, we had, and during the 
so-called Tet Offensive We have been fighting the

34:31.927 --> 34:52.849
Vietcong that is primarily most of the combat 
operations have been carried out against

34:31.927 --> 34:52.849
Vietcong that is indigenous South Vietnamese, 
sometimes led by North Vietnamese, sometimes

34:31.927 --> 34:52.849
augmented by North Vietnamese. The

34:54.450 --> 35:01.798
Tet Offensive was a disaster for the I believe that 
we, during the Tet Offensive and the months

35:03.567 --> 35:24.215
immediately after, I'm saying for three to six 
months after the Tet Offensive began, that we

35:03.567 --> 35:24.215
effectively won the war that we had been fighting. 
And I don't know to this day I can't put my finger on

35:31.242 --> 35:48.904
any particular thing that eventually lost the war 
in Vietnam or eventually caused us to leave and the

35:31.242 --> 35:48.904
South Vietnamese to lose the war. But... How was 
the morale in the ARVN and American forces? Very

35:53.089 --> 35:54.711
high. Very high. As a matter of fact, Most of the 
people that I knew subscribed to that feeling.

36:05.254 --> 36:12.904
Most of the people that I knew had the feeling, 
especially those who had been there during the Tet

36:05.254 --> 36:12.904
Offensive. I was not. But most of the people that I 
knew thought it was a winding down process, that it

36:14.706 --> 36:26.241
was strictly a mopping up and clean it up, and we'll 
be ready to go home in a few months. Because it

36:31.102 --> 36:38.268
appeared that there was nothing else there to 
fight, or very little. It was just about enough

36:38.288 --> 36:41.410
exercise that needed to be carried on. You say that 
you believe that we'd won the war we had been

36:42.011 --> 36:45.133
fighting. What do you think that war was, in your 
opinion? It was a guerrilla civil war up to that

36:48.696 --> 36:56.683
point. with outside assistance from the North, 
Vietnamese and, of course, Chinese and Russians.

37:05.468 --> 37:13.579
But at this particular point, the Viet Cong as an 
entity effectively ceased to exist. It was no

37:14.680 --> 37:22.671
longer a civil war after that point, in my opinion. 
In 68, 69, were the Arvin forces any better

37:23.528 --> 37:29.756
fighters after five years of heavy training? 
Well, the turnover was fairly significant all the

37:31.538 --> 37:43.934
way through, considering that the South 
Vietnamese were taking fairly heavy casualties.

37:45.015 --> 37:50.262
And I still believe that the 51st Arvin was a rather 
professional fighting force. They were

37:55.073 --> 38:03.322
reasonably well trained, even by U.S. standards, 
and they were well led.

38:05.944 --> 38:09.968
In many cases, the officers were junior officers. 
For instance, a captain would be commanding a

38:10.749 --> 38:16.115
battalion in many cases. In the U.S. Army, a 
lieutenant colonel commands a battalion. But if

38:20.077 --> 38:33.010
you look at the experience of the officers we're 
talking about, we're talking about six, eight,

38:20.077 --> 38:33.010
ten, fifteen years' experience in the military. 
And much of that time they had actually been on the

38:33.570 --> 38:42.119
ground fighting the Viet Cong. And I think they 
were, in many cases, very well trained. The

38:49.709 --> 39:04.302
noncommissioned

38:49.709 --> 39:04.302
officer corps, of course, many of those young men 
had been in the Army at times similar to the

38:49.709 --> 39:04.302
officers. Of course, there was always the new 
troops' replacements coming in, being drafted

39:04.322 --> 39:14.271
and brought into the military. And the primary 
problem that they were having was that the pool of

39:19.190 --> 39:35.430
manpower was beginning to become rather shallow, 
that the conscription had been in effect for a

39:19.190 --> 39:35.430
considerable period of time. And again, part of 
the problem was the corruption of civil officials

39:36.391 --> 39:46.463
who for a certain price could buy a deferment, or 
the upper-class young men, they would naturally

39:48.620 --> 40:04.501
go off to school in France or wherever. And 
conscription, again, was rather unfair. And the

40:09.427 --> 40:17.698
conscription teams, I heard tales of press gangs 
going along and around the streets of Saigon

40:17.847 --> 40:27.563
picking up young men and impressing them into the 
military. I don't know if that's true or not. I've

40:30.608 --> 40:35.516
just heard many, many stories about

40:30.608 --> 40:35.516
it. How was the inter-service rivalry

40:35.536 --> 40:42.488
between American forces? Do you believe that 
hampered our victory overall in the war? Not at

40:49.273 --> 40:49.773
all. I'm speaking from my own experience and there 
was no particular rivalry between

40:50.334 --> 41:10.956
Arvin and the U.S. Marine Corps in the period 1968 
and 69, I was

41:11.763 --> 41:24.578
fortunate enough to share an area of operations 
with subordinate elements of the 1st Marine

41:11.763 --> 41:24.578
Division. And with very few exceptions,

41:26.620 --> 41:37.973
the U.S. Army advisors got along just great with 
the US Marines. And because of this,

41:43.960 --> 42:05.648
there was a great deal of rapport between the US 
Army, that I was the representative of the US Army,

41:43.960 --> 42:05.648
and my subordinates and my superiors were the 
representatives of the US Army. And as I recall,

42:06.353 --> 42:13.021
the senior American in the Corps was a Marine 
general. I think his name was Cushman. But his

42:16.264 --> 42:35.787
attitude called for cooperation between the 
Marines and the U.S. Army and the Vietnamese

42:16.264 --> 42:35.787
forces that were available in his Corps of 
Operations, Area of Operations, which coexisted

42:16.264 --> 42:35.787
with the Now,

42:36.914 --> 43:02.482
late in that tour, there was an Army Corps also 
stationed in that area, and I believe a General

42:36.914 --> 43:02.482
Stilwell, he was a three-star general as I recall, 
was the deputy to the Marine General. I'm not

43:02.742 --> 43:06.246
absolutely positive about the command 
structure. But the Vietnamese Corps commander

43:06.715 --> 43:18.310
had his own personal Army advisor who was an Army 
colonel. But the cooperation between the

43:18.330 --> 43:30.626
services and between the nationalities between 
the armies was good, always good. As a matter of

43:31.487 --> 43:35.052
fact, my regiment You see, I began as a battalion 
advisor, and after a few months I moved to the

43:36.010 --> 43:48.027
regiment and the deputy regimental advisor for 
the remainder of my tour. But our artillery

43:48.047 --> 43:54.495
support was U.S. Marine artillery support. Our 
aviation assets were either BNAF, Air Force, or

43:55.216 --> 44:03.688
Marine aviation as far as When I say aviation, I'm 
talking primarily fixed-wing bombers,

44:04.057 --> 44:10.206
fighters, fighter-bombers. The helicopter

44:10.987 --> 44:20.560
assets were U.S. Army assets, and we utilized 
those Army assets. The Marine Corps utilized

44:20.640 --> 44:23.725
them. And the made evacuation was either Vietnam, 
that's Vietnamese Air Force helicopters.

44:38.955 --> 44:46.144
Army helicopters are regular medevac choppers 
that we had access to. And basically, as I recall,

44:46.164 --> 45:00.523
there were no significant priorities between 
Marine If

45:02.427 --> 45:10.195
we needed artillery support, they gave it to us. 
Sometimes if they were already firing a mission

45:12.358 --> 45:19.125
for the Marines, they might get it quicker. They 
would continue to fire that mission, and then they

45:19.746 --> 45:28.215
might shift a battery to support us.
