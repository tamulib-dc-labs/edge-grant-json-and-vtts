WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:06.905
I had compulsory chapel every Sunday morning. 
Everyone had to go. And it's all the students, even

00:09.429 --> 00:14.536
the seniors?

00:14.556 --> 00:17.421
Did you ever have any visiting speakers? Yes, 
there were all visiting speakers. Of course, I

00:22.568 --> 00:24.351
don't remember any of them. Where would they 
speak, in Guyon Hall? In Guyon. They had a regular

00:27.822 --> 00:30.287
church, sort of a church service. They had a song 
service and preaching. Okay, let me clarify. You

00:36.277 --> 00:42.347
had to, I believe they kind of rotated among the 
local, probably Bryan ministers for that

00:36.277 --> 00:42.347
services. Well, they'd bring others in from 
different places. I don't know where they got them

00:45.872 --> 00:48.477
all, but there's always one there. What I was 
wondering is, did they ever have a, say, a foreign

00:50.707 --> 00:56.252
traveler or some dignitary to come and speak to the 
students? No, it was always a religious nature on

00:56.752 --> 01:00.516
Sunday morning. They had these other things 
you're talking about during the week. That's what

01:04.279 --> 01:05.000
I was meaning. During the week they'd have them in 
there. They were not compulsory. You could go if

01:10.044 --> 01:13.387
you liked. Did the cadet officers have any 
privileges that were not available to the other

01:20.575 --> 01:22.677
cadets?

01:25.580 --> 01:28.603
Well, just regular senior privileges. Of course, 
not having been a senior officer, I mean, I was in

01:30.605 --> 01:36.811
the civilian corps then. I don't know about that, 
except as a freshman it always looked to me like

01:36.831 --> 01:43.457
they had the gravy.

01:47.521 --> 01:49.283
Did you have any favorite instructors

01:51.625 --> 01:58.432
Well,

01:51.625 --> 01:58.432
I liked Smith. I've forgotten his name. He taught 
calculus. Probably been in the Robert F. Cuball

02:03.577 --> 02:06.140
Ritchie. He was head of the physics,

02:06.600 --> 02:12.045
no, CE department. And Bolton was head of the 
electrical department.

02:19.452 --> 02:24.197
General Love was one of the civil engineering 
professors. He usually had charge of the summer

02:24.217 --> 02:28.722
practice, CE practice. You called him General. 
Was he a retired military man? I don't know where he

02:32.126 --> 02:33.587
got that name. He kept a box of chalk on his desk, and 
if he ever saw you nodding or looking out the

02:33.627 --> 02:42.477
window, he'd let you have a piece of chalk right in 
your face. Pretty good aim, huh? Yeah.

02:51.211 --> 03:04.307
One of the things that I think sets Texas A&M apart 
from other schools is the number of traditions

02:51.211 --> 03:04.307
that are carried on from year to year by the 
students. And today we have the big bonfire that's

03:05.468 --> 03:16.982
in some controversy, the tradition of silver 
taps, the annual muster on April 21st. Did you have

03:17.323 --> 03:19.986
any of these when you were there as a student? 
That's one thing that made me love A&M was all of

03:20.540 --> 03:25.006
those things. It meant so much to all of us. It's 
just like one big family, really. Did you build a

03:31.735 --> 03:36.321
bonfire all four of the years you were there? And 
everybody worked on it? Yeah. And what about a

03:40.287 --> 03:41.248
muster? Did you have a special ceremony of some 
sort on the 21st of April? I don't remember any on

03:45.133 --> 03:46.575
the campus. We've had musters since we got out, of 
course.

03:51.674 --> 03:54.978
We always had to go to Yale practice. You had to 
attend Yale practice. That was required

03:57.882 --> 03:59.144
attendance. Yeah.

04:04.812 --> 04:09.017
Were there any girls in any of the classes while you 
were there? There were one or two girls who were

04:09.037 --> 04:16.167
daughters of some of the professors, but they were 
not on a full-time basis. They were just taking the

04:16.187 --> 04:20.112
course now and then. And there were a few women, 
girls, that were secretaries in the

04:20.463 --> 04:27.269
administration building, but there were very 
few. Did any of them take any courses? I don't

04:30.011 --> 04:31.112
remember of any. They more than likely were, what, 
residents in Bryant? Yeah. They would ride the

04:37.037 --> 04:40.300
trolley back and forth to campus. Did that trolley 
have a pretty convenient schedule that you could

04:41.942 --> 04:48.708
get in and out without any? Yeah. undue 
complications. You had a little trouble getting

04:51.756 --> 04:53.699
on sometimes. You'd probably have to hang on 
outside. A lot more people wanting to go than it was

04:56.062 --> 05:04.135
room,

04:56.062 --> 05:04.135
huh? Mm-hmm. Okay.

05:07.500 --> 05:16.153
In checking over the

05:07.500 --> 05:16.153
longhorn from your senior year, There was an 
indication that you were a casual, and that meant

05:17.078 --> 05:25.587
that you were not in the military. Did they ever use 
the term non-reg? No, not in the casuals. We were

05:34.017 --> 05:36.660
called casuals. And you didn't have to wear any 
kind of uniform at that point? No, we were entirely

05:41.605 --> 05:43.667
out of the military. It had nothing to do with it at 
all. point later on where somebody told me

05:46.407 --> 05:55.859
yesterday that even though he was not in the 
military his senior year, he had to wear a uniform.

05:56.880 --> 06:00.245
It had an NM on his collar that said non-military. 
No. No, that wasn't true. He just wore regular

06:05.331 --> 06:09.837
civilian clothes all the time. Do you have any 
recollection as to how they came up with the term

06:09.857 --> 06:13.121
casual? No, I don't know where that Other than it 
was casual clothes that you wore, perhaps. I

06:21.445 --> 06:25.028
always took it to mean that you were a casualty. I 
see. That's really the way it started. It was for

06:28.091 --> 06:38.481
boys that were unable physically to participate 
in the military, had some injury or something

06:28.091 --> 06:38.481
happened to them. That's always what I thought it 
was. That might not be right.

06:46.128 --> 06:48.732
Also, you remember the Gold Brickers Club. Yeah. 
What was that? Well, I didn't belong to that. I

06:53.079 --> 06:53.860
don't know. In fact, I didn't belong to any club 
except the Panhandle Club and the

06:53.880 --> 07:04.217
C.E. Club. Were you aware of the existence of the 
Gold Brickers Club? Oh, yeah. What was it? Well, I

07:09.906 --> 07:10.888
don't remember. I don't know. I didn't know 
anything about it. I had my own ideas. Well, today a

07:17.056 --> 07:21.000
Gold Bricker is somebody who's always trying to 
get out and do some work. Well, of course, that's

07:21.020 --> 07:23.383
what the idea was. I mean, that's what it conveyed 
to me.

07:30.070 --> 07:30.851
Okay. When you graduated then in the spring of 22, 
did you have a job lined up the time you graduated?

07:40.562 --> 07:41.363
What was that? It was assistant city engineer in 
Breckenridge, Texas. Is that suburb kind of San

07:48.617 --> 07:50.759
Antonio? No, Breckenridge in Stevens County. 
Stevens County. Close to Abilene. I was thinking

07:56.185 --> 07:59.748
of Breckenridge Park in San Antonio. No, in 
addition to my regular CE course, I took a course in

08:00.810 --> 08:10.540
highway engineering. And I got the job with a firm, 
Hawley and Sands, who operated in Fort Worth. And

08:19.882 --> 08:22.445
they had a resident man in Breckenridge. And they 
were getting ready to do the first paving that went

08:23.987 --> 08:29.593
into Breckenridge, Texas. And when he saw on my 
record that I had done some special work in paving,

08:29.613 --> 08:39.224
asphalt paving, he needed an asphalt man. And 
that's how come me to get the job. I designed the

08:42.380 --> 08:46.105
first asphalt paving that went into 
Breckenridge. However, we paved the main street

08:47.167 --> 08:54.959
with brick and put in the first sewer system. Was 
that, how was the brick laid? Was it herringbone or

08:57.282 --> 08:59.846
just? No, it was, I don't know what you call it. It 
wasn't herringbone. We put out about an

09:04.793 --> 09:08.218
eight-inch concrete base and put about couple of 
inches of sand on it, laid the brick on that, and it

09:08.738 --> 09:12.523
was all done by hand. Not much other way to lay brick 
is.

09:18.532 --> 09:20.896
Did you have reinforcing steel in the concrete 
base?

09:23.680 --> 09:25.322
Yeah. Were you involved in the design of that part 
of the street too? Well, I did a lot of the drafting

09:29.047 --> 09:31.311
on it. I didn't do any of the design on that, no. But 
then you say you were involved in the design of the

09:36.920 --> 09:40.024
sewer system? The sewer system and the asphalt.

09:45.009 --> 09:48.133
How long did you stay in Breckenridge then? I 
believe I was there a little over a year, and then I

09:48.273 --> 09:58.564
went to work for Pittsburgh Testing Laboratories 
in San Antonio. At that time they had a contract to

10:00.407 --> 10:03.450
test all the pavement that went down in San 
Antonio, about four or five different paving

10:03.835 --> 10:09.642
companies operating there. And I had a laboratory 
and it was my job to take samples, daily samples of

10:10.483 --> 10:17.591
their work. This was to make sure that they were 
using the— Check it to see if it was within

10:18.092 --> 10:22.056
specifications. Specified materials for the 
pavement. Check the amount of asphalt that was in

10:27.363 --> 10:31.227
it, percentage of asphalt.

10:32.945 --> 10:45.076
character asphalt, and also the gravel and metal 
base that went into it. And how long did you stay at

10:45.096 --> 10:47.237
that then? Oh, a couple of years, I guess.

10:53.323 --> 11:01.770
And then I had a chance to go to Shackleford County, 
but Albany, Texas is a County, Cedar-Sapford

11:02.122 --> 11:08.609
County, as an assistant county engineer.

11:11.433 --> 11:15.537
At that time, they were doing a lot of highway work.

11:19.202 --> 11:24.728
And I was assistant to the county engineer there.

11:27.111 --> 11:31.015
We built some roads north of Bracken Ridge and east 
toward Caddo. This would be asphalt roads.

11:34.442 --> 11:35.323
Asphalt roads. Within the county. Uh-huh. They 
were just county roads. And we were working for the

11:38.147 --> 11:40.811
county commissioner.

11:44.597 --> 11:49.885
But we found out that the county judge and one of the 
commissioners and the contractor had a thing

11:44.597 --> 11:49.885
going.

11:53.190 --> 11:56.055
And we were on just a month-to-month basis. We 
didn't have a contract to do the engineering, just

11:56.095 --> 12:00.141
working for them by the month. The judge called us 
in and told us he wanted us to favor the contractor

12:01.353 --> 12:08.322
in certain aspects. In fact, he wanted us to take an 
inspector off the concrete bridge. Said he

12:13.749 --> 12:17.234
thought we could tell whether it was concrete or 
not when it took the forms off. And several things

12:18.916 --> 12:23.742
that he instructed us to do, and we told him we 
couldn't do that. And he said, well, You boys stick

12:27.188 --> 12:31.974
with us, and we'll have you making $1,000 a month 
right along. As you come back in a few days, and he

12:32.014 --> 12:39.725
asked us then at the end of the three days, and we 
told him we were still of the same opinion. He said,

12:40.706 --> 12:43.009
well, get your stuff and get out of the courthouse. 
So that ended that. I had just bought a lot and built

12:45.833 --> 12:51.020
a home, furnished it, settled down. This was in 
Albany. No, in Breckenridge. In Breckenridge,

12:54.184 --> 12:54.985
yeah. And then I went to work the next week, I guess 
it was, for Texas Carbon Industries. They had a

13:06.249 --> 13:20.166
carbon plant in Breckenridge making carbon 
black, which at that time was pretty much in demand

13:06.249 --> 13:20.166
for automobile tires, Victrola records, and 
printer's ink, and such as that.

13:24.711 --> 13:26.153
And I went from there. over to Albany

13:27.078 --> 13:35.126
working for an oil company in petroleum 
engineering construction. Built some gasoline

13:35.166 --> 13:41.552
plants, repressor plants, recycling plants. 
What company was this? It was an independent

13:43.174 --> 13:45.696
company, Rosier and Pendleton. They've since 
gone out of existence. Just a couple of fellows

13:52.243 --> 13:56.427
that came out of the army and Struck it lucky and got 
a lease over there and built up quite a thing. It was

14:02.615 --> 14:06.981
quite an organization for about twenty-five 
years. Did they sell out to somebody else? No, we

14:09.484 --> 14:12.849
finally exhausted the supply. It was sand 
production, sand lenses, and it's kind of like

14:12.969 --> 14:22.923
this Ogallala water formation here. It just had so 
much in it and we got it all out and that was it. And

14:29.330 --> 14:32.273
then we moved to Lubbock from there. My wife had 
some farms up in this area, Castro and Bailey and

14:32.313 --> 14:41.942
Hockley County. When was that that you moved to 
Lubbock? That was 1949. And that's what I've been

14:47.467 --> 14:50.850
doing since then, looking after the farms.

14:54.534 --> 14:55.995
What's your principal crop then? Or crops, I 
guess. Well, I guess maize, probably, and corn

14:58.474 --> 15:03.420
now. We've raised lots of corn the last few years. 
But we raised maize and wheat, sugar beets,

15:06.504 --> 15:14.834
cotton, corn, and some soybeans. Has this been a 
gradual change, going into different

15:14.854 --> 15:20.240
commodities?

15:22.923 --> 15:26.708
Well, no, not especially. Of course, when we first 
started out, there wasn't much irrigation.

15:32.875 --> 15:34.657
Irrigation was just getting going. We drilled a 
bunch of wells and gradually got into different

15:35.598 --> 15:40.883
phases.

15:44.487 --> 15:48.831
Of course, within the last ten years, sugar beets 
have been in. We didn't have any sugar beets early,

15:48.911 --> 15:54.737
because they built that plant at Hereford.

15:55.763 --> 16:00.187
But the main thing this year, nearly everything's 
in corn and maize. We had some wheat and a little

16:00.507 --> 16:07.273
cotton, not much cotton.

16:08.314 --> 16:19.685
Did the sugar beet plant come in and did somebody 
decide it was a good area to grow sugar beets and

16:08.314 --> 16:19.685
encourage the production and build the plant, or 
did the plant come first? Some outfit in Denver,

16:20.745 --> 16:25.770
Holly, Holly Sugar Corporation, They put a plant 
in at Hereford. Of course, they made us help pay for

16:30.529 --> 16:32.871
it. They took out a dollar or two dollars a ton out of 
every ton of beets that went in there to help pay for

16:32.891 --> 16:40.860
the plant.

16:44.945 --> 16:49.209
But our main crop the last two years has been maize 
and corn.

16:54.395 --> 16:56.297
Did you raise any cattle along with the No. We've 
had a few cattle along, but never over 40 head, I

16:59.286 --> 17:07.936
guess. Some of the farms had grass on them, and of 
course we'd graze the wheat and things like that.

17:16.607 --> 17:25.457
After you've combined the wheat, you graze the... 
Well, we graze it after it's planted, planted

17:16.607 --> 17:25.457
about middle of October, and you can turn on it 
about, oh, sometime before Christmas and leave

17:25.893 --> 17:33.665
them on there until March.

17:37.331 --> 17:42.519
And of course, when the maize is harvested, turn 
them on the maize stalks. Well, in other words, you

17:42.539 --> 17:47.707
raised the wheat as a winter grazing crop rather 
than as a grain. No, it was raised principally for

17:47.727 --> 17:51.813
harvest.

17:52.554 --> 17:54.297
But the grazing was just incidental. But so the 
grazing was prior to the harvest or after? Oh,

17:59.956 --> 18:00.757
yeah, before the harvest. Before the harvest. 
Yeah. Yeah, before it heads. When it starts to

18:04.462 --> 18:10.529
head, you have to take off of it before the boot 
starts. The boot is what the head grows in. You can

18:13.293 --> 18:16.196
take it off, take off the grazing before that. It 
was more or less incidental.

18:24.647 --> 18:24.807
Um. Would you say then that irrigation has been one 
of the big developments in the last 25, 30 years in

18:25.495 --> 18:38.936
the farming of this area? Yeah. Of course, it 
started way back in the, well, I think the first

18:39.337 --> 18:47.650
well drilled up here in Plainview around 1911. But 
there wasn't very much irrigation done before

18:49.052 --> 18:53.359
1935.

18:58.385 --> 19:01.729
Most of the early irrigation was what, with 
windmills? No, it was all- Gasoline pumps? With

19:05.113 --> 19:06.555
irrigation pumps. The first irrigation out at 
Portales, when we lived out there, there was some

19:08.658 --> 19:14.325
irrigation. That was back in 1907 and eight, nine. 
But at that time, they had no equipment to lift the

19:18.950 --> 19:22.815
water. They'd dig a pit. down twenty-five feet 
deep and about ten feet square and it set an

19:25.908 --> 19:55.307
ordinary centrifugal pump down there because it 
wouldn't pick the water up and put the engine up on

19:25.908 --> 19:55.307
top and belt driven down through there and that 
centrifugal pump would throw the water out of that

19:25.908 --> 19:55.307
hole but of course then later sometime

19:25.908 --> 19:55.307
in the twenties some man designed a the modern 
irrigation pumps.

20:01.474 --> 20:03.517
That's when irrigation really got started.

20:08.002 --> 20:11.467
Of course, even then they didn't have gear heads. 
They drove their pumps by a belt, a long flat belt

20:11.487 --> 20:23.522
hooked onto an engine sitting out ten or fifteen 
feet away. But now the engines are all direct

20:24.278 --> 20:40.756
connected to a gear head, which is not the same as a 
differential on a car, but it has a big gear and a

20:24.278 --> 20:40.756
little gear on the engine, kind of like a car 
differential. And the motor is direct connected

20:42.978 --> 20:52.328
to it.

20:53.084 --> 21:03.598
When you came out to Lubbock to sort of take over the 
farms, did you sever all connections with Rosser

20:53.084 --> 21:03.598
and Pendleton? Yes. I did some work here for 
Coleman Hazy and some engineering over at Sudan.

21:15.072 --> 21:22.602
Put in the water system over there and a sewer 
system in Sudan in 19—well, that was before That

21:24.100 --> 21:29.707
was back in the 30s, so I was working then for the 
city of Sudan. But after I came here, I worked for

21:30.708 --> 21:33.592
Coleman Hazy. We did some work at Post and Summit, 
Littlefield, and Bevel Land, Graham, paving and

21:33.612 --> 21:42.303
sewer work, things like that. But I was just on a 
salary with Coleman Hazy, Hazy and Green.

21:50.071 --> 21:53.515
Are you doing any kind of engineering at the 
moment? Oh, no. No, I haven't done any of that in 10

21:54.737 --> 21:56.940
years.

21:59.783 --> 22:05.971
Well, I mean, there have been a lot of developments 
along the line there. Oh, yeah. That you'd have to

22:06.632 --> 22:08.014
keep up with. Quite different now. Yeah, I'd have 
to go to school again to go back in the oil field.

22:15.303 --> 22:17.947
They've learned things that we didn't know about. 
What about sewer systems and paving? Well, it

22:20.800 --> 22:24.564
hasn't changed a whole lot, basically.

22:29.070 --> 22:40.243
Well, I was talking with a highwayman yesterday, 
and he said, as far as he was concerned, the

22:29.070 --> 22:40.243
principal development in highways has been the 
computerization of design work. Yeah. I imagine

22:41.965 --> 22:43.166
so, of course. I know nothing about that. I don't 
have any conception of what a computer is. You said

22:48.385 --> 22:58.494
that the products which they use today is not 
drastically different from what they were using

22:48.385 --> 22:58.494
forty years ago to build roads. That's right. 
Although they build them wider and longer. Of

23:02.938 --> 23:15.529
course, back in the early twenties in the 
summertime while I was going to A&M, I worked for

23:02.938 --> 23:15.529
the highway department on highways up around 
Amarillo. and all the material then was hauled in

23:16.977 --> 23:31.920
by teams, mule teams, horse teams,

23:16.977 --> 23:31.920
and everything was done by hand except the hauling 
of the gravel. They used Fresnos with three mules

23:33.502 --> 23:45.060
hitched to a Fresno to do the dirt work where they do 
it now with all the machines.

23:45.462 --> 23:47.405
Basically, it was the same then as now. They put on a 
10 or 12 inch base, top it off with some asphalt

23:47.465 --> 23:54.495
mixture of some kind. That was it. Either that or 
concrete. They'd been doing that for a long time.

24:01.085 --> 24:03.248
Yeah, they'd been doing concrete a long time. 
There wasn't too much of it done, though, up until

24:04.470 --> 24:09.057
the late 20s.

24:13.222 --> 24:22.955
Have you been involved in any kind of social or 
fraternal activities or any political

24:13.222 --> 24:22.955
activities? No. No, I haven't been in politics at 
all.

24:31.127 --> 24:43.043
Oh, we belong to little groups here, Sunday 
schools and church groups and occasional bridge

24:31.127 --> 24:43.043
group. Nothing of any consequence.

24:48.871 --> 24:51.234
And I haven't been going to A&M Club. I don't know 
that I've ever been to it here. I used to go in

24:55.099 --> 25:00.505
Houston, San Antonio. And

25:00.525 --> 25:10.817
I belonged to the Agriculture Club here for a 
while, but I haven't been active in that for 10 or 15

25:00.525 --> 25:10.817
years. I never was much of a joiner. Well, you have 
to have some of that joining characteristic to

25:14.849 --> 25:23.340
belong and continue activities. Most of our 
activities have been in connection with the

25:23.360 --> 25:26.845
church and Sunday school.

25:30.350 --> 25:41.565
Well, not everybody can be participating

25:30.350 --> 25:41.565
in everything.
