WEBVTT

00:03.457 --> 00:04.558
Mr. Rudder didn't know that Dr. Byers had 
restricted my area of work to work on the entering

00:04.779 --> 00:22.342
students out of the registrar, out of the 
admissions office. Now, when you first began

00:22.362 --> 00:31.134
counseling and testing, Wayne Hall was the vice 
president. Describe working with him. I'm very

00:34.743 --> 00:38.988
fond of Dr. Hall. He was a man who, he had a sense of 
humor. He had high standards, but he was very

00:44.534 --> 00:49.139
pragmatic. I remember the ag students began to 
complain because they had to take

00:50.300 --> 01:03.855
the science advanced test, the GRE. And Dr. Hall 
said, are you a scientist? And the student said,

01:10.590 --> 01:13.153
yes. He said, well, we'll take you.

01:19.882 --> 01:32.138
Dr. Hall,

01:19.882 --> 01:32.138
he was a very fine person to work under because he 
knew what you were doing. Now, Earl Rutter

01:32.827 --> 01:36.813
selected him as vice president, didn't he? Yes. 
Because I worked for Dr. Hall for two and a half

01:37.955 --> 01:48.471
years, and to me, they seemed different in 
personalities. Yes. And I've wondered how Mr.

01:50.534 --> 02:00.690
Rutter came, do you have any idea how Mr. Rutter 
came to identify Hall as the appropriate person to

01:50.534 --> 02:00.690
be the vice president? I think President Rutter 
was a very pragmatic person, and if he felt an

02:01.328 --> 02:22.003
individual had the qualifications that he was 
seeking, he would never let a personal

02:01.328 --> 02:22.003
temperament or... Now did Dean, did Dr. Hall go 
from being a department head to vice president?

02:26.128 --> 02:29.392
No, he was dean of the graduate college. Oh, that's 
right, that's right. He went from, yeah. And that

02:32.256 --> 02:38.704
was one of the difficulties that they had, as I 
understand it. President Rudder, like he did in my

02:38.864 --> 02:48.176
case, he said, Wayne didn't handle both of those. 
Well, that didn't last. And Wayne... It was

02:53.152 --> 02:55.535
unfortunate. Now Dr. Bars, Dr. Bars is a very 
brilliant scientist currently. Even if the boys

03:08.653 --> 03:16.464
did name the oceanography Bars' last great 
erection.

03:19.769 --> 03:20.650
But Dr. Bars during most of my time under him, I had 
sort of an uncomfortable relationship. It wasn't

03:30.338 --> 03:36.348
anything except you'd go to see him and his desk was 
clear. It had a little memo pad in front of it. And

03:40.775 --> 03:42.818
you would make your case. And if he would reach over 
and scribble something on that sheet of paper,

03:43.591 --> 03:50.002
well, you could feel pretty good. But if he just sat 
there, you finally got the message that he was

03:50.763 --> 03:57.855
saying, get out of here. But I don't think he 
understood us. Well, Graff told me one time, he

04:04.025 --> 04:09.514
said, I think if I understood you, I could agree 
with you. Let me put into this machine an anecdote I

04:10.540 --> 04:18.468
remember about Byers one time. I was chairman of 
the library committee then, and we were trying to

04:19.209 --> 04:31.763
consolidate into the newly expanded, the first 
expansion of the Cushing Library, and we were

04:19.209 --> 04:31.763
trying to bring all the branch libraries in. And 
architecture agreed, business agreed,

04:37.270 --> 04:41.415
Veterinary medicine, we agreed, should stay west 
of the tracks, that that was so separate. And the

04:41.876 --> 04:43.078
other one was chemistry. And chemistry said, no, 
no, no. That, no, no, we've got to have our own.

04:49.626 --> 04:54.533
Well, our budget was so limited, and what we were 
trying to do was to make our dollars go as far as we

04:49.626 --> 04:54.533
could. And so we called a public discussion one 
night in the library of this matter. And we asked

05:04.540 --> 05:12.628
the chemistry department to come and make their 
case and for Dr. Byers to be there since it all

05:04.540 --> 05:12.628
reported to him. And one of the chemists, and I 
can't remember whether it was the department head

05:13.890 --> 05:25.481
or not, I think it was, he finally got near the end of 
his remarks and he said, well, we had hoped not to

05:13.890 --> 05:25.481
have to be this blunt with it. But we chemists do not 
have time to waste like you other people do to spend

05:25.501 --> 05:33.990
our time walking to the library we have too much to 
do for that and dr byers said meeting adjourned

05:34.544 --> 05:55.202
decision made chemistry library moved to the main 
library it's over yeah that dr buyers without

05:34.544 --> 05:55.202
question i i think that um Well, we had Dr. Byers 
over in an effort to try to get a more cordial

05:55.638 --> 06:02.224
relationship. And we showed him through the 
center and what we did. And Dr. Holt was with me. And

06:09.991 --> 06:20.501
when we finished, we

06:09.991 --> 06:20.501
said, we enjoyed having you over, Dr. Byers. And he 
said, anyone ever choose

06:28.696 --> 06:37.428
He won't say anything, but he holds it and turned 
and walked off. And I said, no, Dr. Byers, no one's

06:37.448 --> 06:43.917
going to mention that. And I said, I'll escort you 
back over to the cook. He said, that isn't

06:49.164 --> 06:51.728
necessary. I said, no, sir, it isn't, but it's 
going to be good. And I walked back over there with

06:54.632 --> 06:58.197
him. Well, as time went on, Dr. Bars and I, we seemed 
to be better. And he was never discourteous.

07:13.550 --> 07:14.631
Haskell, Dr. Bars, is a great man, scientist.

07:21.800 --> 07:27.306
But he was supervising something that he didn't 
have a grasp of. What can you say about Bill Graff

07:27.438 --> 07:35.849
and his years in between Hall and Myers? I would say 
with all honesty that I think Texas A&M University

07:37.871 --> 07:50.627
made an error in judgment in bringing Dr. Graff to 
the campus for the work he did. And I think Dr.

07:51.738 --> 07:58.650
Graff, it was unfortunate that he didn't 
recognize it. I agree with you. And because both

08:00.493 --> 08:06.384
sides seemed to understand. And it was difficult 
on the people that, well I remember one time that I

08:17.152 --> 08:23.959
got this study on the, you know, we made that famous 
co-ed study. And the counselor said, that's what

08:24.379 --> 08:29.044
we didn't want to do. He called me down there and 
just dumped it on me. I said, okay, I've been

08:32.608 --> 08:36.592
trained to do that. So we came back and we chose the 
most logical approach was through the family. And

08:44.995 --> 08:58.058
more than that, we could go through the youngest 
child in the family, in the public schools, and get

08:44.995 --> 08:58.058
the questionnaire out. We divided up the area, and 
we visited superintendents. We did not have a

09:04.750 --> 09:07.695
single person turn us down. Now, was this the study 
over here in East Texas? No, that was Barton

09:11.551 --> 09:13.275
Nelson. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that was 
unfortunate. That was a good scientific sample,

09:16.681 --> 09:22.513
in my opinion. And Barton Nelson's a fine man. but 
he was hurt by that. Because I remember I was on the

09:30.888 --> 09:45.386
Aspirations Committee, and we used that study as 
one of our strong arguments for co-education, for

09:30.888 --> 09:45.386
broadening the curriculum. But I've always 
worried that some opponents of those positive

09:45.787 --> 09:56.160
changes blame, burden, for having done that study 
and reaching the conclusions that... Oh, I think

09:56.933 --> 10:02.461
that this happened. Actually, Dr. Nelson 
certainly retained his reputation in sociology,

10:04.825 --> 10:16.222
but I think that his chances are being recognized. 
Yes. Well, Dean Graff had

10:17.656 --> 10:29.387
what I would call an obnoxious personality.

10:29.975 --> 10:33.439
He could be, and with me, could be very abrupt. Yes. 
And there wasn't any, if I'm not mistaken, he was a

10:36.502 --> 10:45.533
native Texan, but he wasn't able to relate well to 
Texans. Let's go on to more positive. Share some

10:47.815 --> 10:49.197
Rudder stories. Oh.

10:56.625 --> 10:58.007
President Rudder, I don't have many of them 
because I was not around him in a social situation.

11:04.989 --> 11:17.028
But

11:04.989 --> 11:17.028
President Rutter, he could handle himself real 
well. A group of us flew up with some students to

11:17.609 --> 11:23.438
West Point for a football game. And President 
Rutter got up there, but he wasn't on that plane. We

11:30.769 --> 11:33.051
were in the old cargo plane then. But he, I got the 
feedback that he was very popular. He was very

11:41.718 --> 11:44.181
popular. He could be tough, or he knew when it was 
social, I guess. But my relationship I remember

11:53.033 --> 12:07.258
the last freshman night that President Rutter was 
alive.

12:08.080 --> 12:10.063
See, we would have the freshman meet for that 
night, and we'd either sing in the area

12:10.887 --> 12:24.082
around the old movie theater or what have you. And 
we graduated to having air conditioning in the

12:24.102 --> 12:32.992
gymnasium, and so we had it in there. There's more 
company. In G. Roddick White? G. Roddick White.

12:36.807 --> 12:57.668
And I sat with Mrs. Rutter on the front row there, 
and he spoke to the boys, the young men, about the

12:36.807 --> 12:57.668
importance of choosing a good mate. life 
expectancy. It was very simple but direct. And I

13:10.556 --> 13:16.245
had no idea that that was his last meeting. But I dug 
out this old song that's published a lot. warm beat

13:24.698 --> 13:35.213
the hearts of all thy sons, old A&M of Texas, none 
but the staunch, and goes through that. President

13:35.814 --> 13:41.102
Rudder didn't recognize me. And so he got word to me 
he wanted a copy of that. Well, I sent him a copy. But

13:49.154 --> 13:51.938
I have... I know I was in some meetings. I was made 
project coordinator of the Rudder Conference

13:55.805 --> 14:02.556
Center. I didn't even know what it was. We were 
flying back from Chicago. And

14:07.624 --> 14:11.851
they dispelled it. One of the members of the group 
kept telling me, you need to do this and you need to

14:12.151 --> 14:19.022
do that. I said, what? I'm not having anything to do 
with this. I came up here to help with a certain part

14:23.009 --> 14:28.778
of it which related to what we need in this case. 
Actually, I had chaired a committee that was to

14:31.562 --> 14:39.954
determine what should go into the voter 
conference. Well, we did a thorough job on that

14:40.815 --> 14:43.840
aspect. We sent to every facet of the university a 
questionnaire and welcome them saying, this is

14:49.208 --> 14:53.834
what we would use it for. These are the things that 
we would need. Now, this whole project began after

14:57.619 --> 15:04.528
Mr. Rutter's death under Jack Williams? No. It 
began, let's see, I think it was under

15:08.593 --> 15:16.403
construction because didn't President Rutter 
die in 70? 70. 70. Okay, so it was under

15:19.280 --> 15:21.565
construction. Were we calling it the Rudder 
Center then? No. That's why. Okay. No, it was not.

15:27.860 --> 15:31.909
It was just the expansion of MSC and all. Yes. Well, 
President Rudder said in Austin, that street is

15:32.811 --> 15:38.284
dividing lines. you're responsible over here. 
But don't get messing around over there. And he

15:44.455 --> 15:46.718
said, I'm gonna tell them the same thing. He said, 
the problem is that the faculty has taken over the

15:46.898 --> 15:52.485
MSC. The kids can't meet in those rooms because of 
it. And he said, I'm not gonna have it fussing back

15:56.970 --> 16:01.515
and forth. Well, he took care of that. He took the 
street out. But that was... That was something

16:09.162 --> 16:12.290
else.

16:15.399 --> 16:16.181
Finally, J.O. Adams was a great help to me.

16:23.781 --> 16:24.403
He said, Well, just move along. You do this, and you 
watch for that, and you do this. And I think he went

16:32.096 --> 16:45.636
to President Rutter and said, President Rutter, 
this fellow's got so many obligations now, you

16:32.096 --> 16:45.636
don't know which door he's coming out of. And then 
they, oh, the old boy that led the choir, Well, he

16:54.944 --> 17:02.910
was the one that was chosen. He wouldn't take it. I 
thought, oh man. There's one way you want to blow

17:07.027 --> 17:13.897
yourself out of this place is refusing an 
assignment. But he got away with it, but he did

17:14.597 --> 17:20.105
because the president lived there a lot. But it was 
good in another way. Bill Hensel took it over. Bill

17:24.832 --> 17:28.757
is as solid as he can be. Now were you and your group, 
were you all involved in any of the work that led to

17:37.317 --> 17:43.807
the recommendations about co-education and 
non-compulsory core and racial integration?

17:43.887 --> 17:45.249
Well, yes, I think so. We, of course, everything we 
did was service. Service. I believe that that's

17:52.220 --> 17:55.304
the whole concept of guidance.

17:57.468 --> 18:00.372
Sure.

18:00.689 --> 18:07.540
You see, really, this first one to grab, grabbed me 
on what to do with it. So he dumped it on us. Well,

18:09.423 --> 18:10.285
that's all right. That's what I'm hired out to do. 
But we had experience there. And so we devised this

18:19.881 --> 18:25.650
information sheet.

18:31.537 --> 18:47.094
Now that we have this machine turned back on, Mr. 
Rutter dies, and you said a while ago that you were

18:31.537 --> 18:47.094
not aware of his being in poor health or anything. 
Most of us, I think, were quite surprised. Yeah.

18:53.462 --> 19:00.970
Then General Ludeke was the interim for a few 
months, and then Jack Williams came. Do you

19:01.186 --> 19:07.216
remember any first impressions of him, first 
acquaintances with him? Well, yes, I remember

19:08.638 --> 19:17.933
my first meeting with him. We had a program, and 
this was in 1971. We still had our program out, the

19:24.503 --> 19:27.328
A&M adjunct. But the legislature in its wisdom had 
taken it away and we wanted to acquaint the

19:28.540 --> 19:44.947
president with the program. And we didn't know 
what the future was, but we wanted to do that. Jack

19:49.354 --> 19:51.578
Dobson was the director. I went with him because I 
was the administrative officer responsible,

19:52.165 --> 20:02.021
which I think was a big secret on the campus. I think 
I was the only one who knew that. The third person

20:07.370 --> 20:15.102
was the dean of liberal

20:07.370 --> 20:15.102
arts. Because the courses, I mean, that we were 
offering were mostly in the liberal arts. Now this

20:22.773 --> 20:23.634
was Maxwell? Yes. David Maxwell? Yes. He said he'd 
be glad to go with us. We were walking, the three of

20:31.506 --> 20:37.155
us, from the academic building down toward the 
system. And Dr. Dean Maxwell said, Austin, I'm

20:43.786 --> 21:05.279
delighted to go down and be with President 
Williams and help any way I can, but he said, I don't

20:43.786 --> 21:05.279
understand why you're doing it because they are 
transferring everything in, I think it was the

20:43.786 --> 21:05.279
first of June. And I said, transferring what? And 
he said, you don't know? I said, no, I don't know

21:13.021 --> 21:14.863
what you're talking about. We are about 
three-fourths filled. And you see, we'd send our

21:19.388 --> 21:29.761
material out, and he said, well, we've got a real 
reason to go then. We got down there, and President

21:29.781 --> 21:37.570
Williams, as you know, he's very gracious. He 
said, I understand you want to show me some things

21:38.360 --> 21:42.345
about the NMA job. And I said, yes, Dr. Dobson is the 
director and he will show you. And Jack said, I

21:49.824 --> 21:52.207
don't think I want to. And Preston Williams said, 
why? And he said, well, you're closing the thing

21:57.795 --> 22:07.650
the 1st of June and I didn't know it until about 
halfway down here from the academic building. And

22:08.190 --> 22:13.378
he said, I'm not going to waste my time going over 
something that Well, he meant it was handled that

22:14.573 --> 22:18.259
way. And President Williams said, well, now wait 
just a minute. He said, I've heard good reports

22:21.243 --> 22:27.713
about that program and I really would like to know 
what it's about. And then he turned and buzzed Bob

22:28.634 --> 22:33.702
Cherry. And Bob came in and he told Bob what the 
situation was. And Mr. Cherry said, well, I

22:41.489 --> 22:54.902
believe the wise thing to do would be to call the 
board and alert them to what had happened. And so

22:54.922 --> 23:07.615
President Williams said, well, check with each 
one of them and see if they would approve changing

22:54.922 --> 23:07.615
the date to September 1st. And that's what Mr. 
Cherry did. Was this the coordinating board or the

23:12.835 --> 23:16.582
A&M board? It was the A&M board. Oh, okay. It was the 
A&M board. And Jack was satisfied. Jack made a good

23:27.219 --> 23:29.383
presentation. But President Williams, though, 
what impressed me was that it didn't rattle him at

23:29.684 --> 23:38.338
all. I think he kind of got a little enjoyment out of 
it. He's taking a job where someone had messed up.

23:49.335 --> 23:57.328
Now, I don't mean that critically because I 
understand that A&M didn't really have much say.

23:58.186 --> 24:04.993
that this was all developed and carried out from 
the political side. That's what I've always

24:05.113 --> 24:06.474
understood. And so we really had no interest in it. 
But that was another of Mr. Gilchrist's ideas.

24:21.409 --> 24:23.451
Here was an engineer that said, If we could have a 
facility where we get these young men here and we

24:23.887 --> 24:47.479
would go about in a business-like, systematic way 
of what college is all about, I want the best

24:23.887 --> 24:47.479
professors that we can get, and these young people 
will do better the first year than those who don't.

24:49.262 --> 24:49.662
Let's see. We'll save Williams for a little while. 
Describe the adjunct. About how long did it exist

24:58.462 --> 25:05.752
and describe the physical plant and so forth. 
Well, the adjunct, as it was called, consisted of

25:05.772 --> 25:18.531
about 500 acres of land, all of which the land Llano 
River flowed through. There was a mile or so of

25:21.730 --> 25:27.315
access to the Llano River. It had a beautiful grove 
of old con trees along the river bank. It's just

25:36.344 --> 25:38.166
south of Junction. Yes, just south of Junction. 
Well,

25:41.369 --> 25:48.096
it was almost in the city limits. It was, well now 
the people of Kimball County had bought this land

25:48.650 --> 26:02.587
and then turned it over to A&M. I think that Kimball 
County was trying to get a two-year college and

26:03.108 --> 26:14.342
some of the more knowledgeable people in the 
community told me this. A&M felt they could make

26:18.586 --> 26:30.603
use of it, but they didn't feel strongly, 
apparently, about the academic two-year

26:18.586 --> 26:30.603
program, taking it on. Well, this was in, the first 
year was 1951. It was summer, 51. And we had a

26:39.797 --> 26:46.146
contingent of freshmen that, two six-week 
sessions. And we also had the civil engineering

26:50.187 --> 27:02.078
students who did their practicum in surveying 
one, one six weeks from one another. And the

27:02.959 --> 27:07.823
geologists came for their field experience. And 
we were mainly a base camp for the geologists. It

27:16.737 --> 27:20.983
was, I missed the first summer. The rest of the time 
I was pretty strongly involved. The first two or

27:28.994 --> 27:40.110
three years I taught and was the, well the 
equivalent of basic division. Cliff Ransdell was

27:41.993 --> 27:45.057
the director. Then when Dean Bertrand,

27:46.083 --> 28:09.270
for some reason, he made a move and he went from 
Texas A&M to the University of Las Vegas or

27:46.083 --> 28:09.270
something, somewhere up in the mountains, and 
became the Dean of the College of Agriculture.

28:10.411 --> 28:12.934
Cliff then had to take over the interim of the basic 
division. That was the year then that I became the

28:18.331 --> 28:29.362
director, and I was director from 55 to 59, 
something like that. Director of? The A&M

28:30.764 --> 28:31.785
adjunct. Of the adjunct. That meant that I had to go 
out there. Well, it was delightful, really,

28:37.391 --> 28:40.174
Haskell. There was no ranch house on the property, 
and it was real nice. It was a wood-framed house.

28:47.963 --> 28:58.036
And out there, if you keep your windows up, you got 
air conditioning every night, and our children

28:47.963 --> 28:58.036
could play. And the children of other faculty 
members, Dr. Segrist headed up the physical

28:58.677 --> 29:07.609
education, And he had a very good organization. 
And he had a time in the afternoon when the children

29:10.714 --> 29:18.863
of faculty could swim. And the interesting thing 
was the faculty lived with the students. That is,

29:29.976 --> 29:33.580
we lived in GI. which GI tents and then we put 
permanent roofs on but we left the screens. We ate

29:44.963 --> 30:02.908
with the students and in the in the program we had 
every night a professor in each of the English

30:03.310 --> 30:11.526
would be available at the administration 
building to hold health sessions. Now, by and

30:11.546 --> 30:14.372
large, what courses were offered? Okay, English 
103, at first English 100 section, And then we had

30:22.261 --> 30:28.157
math 101 or 102. At first it was 100. You know that 
remedial stuff, after about the first two

30:31.867 --> 30:38.464
summers, the parents and students, these sharp 
youngsters that looked for things, that was too

30:38.765 --> 30:49.600
good a thing. So it didn't take but a few years, and 
the better students were coming out there. And I

30:56.510 --> 30:59.675
would be filled by the first of May. So math and 
English. Math and English. And then we moved into

31:03.520 --> 31:09.025
biology. And we tried to teach chemistry, but it 
just wasn't practical. It was a chemistry 100,

31:14.708 --> 31:19.614
but... Now, it went for how many weeks? Six weeks. 
Six weeks. Where did those six weeks fall? Well,

31:23.578 --> 31:31.167
they would fall from about June the 1st to middle of 
July. Oh, so you could do two, there were two six

31:32.008 --> 31:35.573
weeks? Yes. But a student would...
