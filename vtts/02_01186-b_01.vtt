WEBVTT

00:02.798 --> 00:10.546
Well, when I came on board, we had great difficulty 
getting people, honest astronomers, to look at

00:02.798 --> 00:10.546
the planets. That changed when we had specific 
problems that were of interest to people, such as

00:11.808 --> 00:21.258
what is the actual surface pressure on Mars? I 
remember it when IceBinRad came out with that

00:22.219 --> 00:24.781
number. That was a bombshell because they had 
already started building probes for 85 millibar

00:24.801 --> 00:31.869
surface pressure. Right. When we started to pique 
the interest of astronomers with some specific

00:32.313 --> 00:48.114
problems, the astronomers started to use the 
techniques, the technologies that had been

00:32.313 --> 00:48.114
developed in the interim to look at the planets. 
They had not, with the exception of a very few

00:48.695 --> 00:51.638
people. Bill Sinton and company did the infrared. 
They were doing spectra. Kuiper was doing some

01:01.051 --> 01:06.397
work, but there were a very limited number of 
people. But when a serious problem came along, and

01:07.498 --> 01:14.887
why did these astronomers pay attention to 
planetary problems? Because NASA said, we are

01:15.528 --> 01:20.774
going to send spacecraft to these planets. We are 
going to find out something. Planets became of

01:23.397 --> 01:29.944
greater interest to the public, the 
universities, and to the scientists. And what we

01:32.761 --> 01:50.667
did in those areas was simply to say, if we had a 
problem such as, let's say, the surface pressure

01:32.761 --> 01:50.667
on Mars, bring together people that we thought 
might have some idea of how to approach the

01:32.761 --> 01:50.667
problem. You know, bring them together in a big 
meeting. Money was no problem in those days. Say,

01:57.276 --> 01:58.378
here's the problem. Here's what they told us in the 
past. We just want you to think about the problem.

02:06.429 --> 02:07.530
What we need is this." And many of them went away and 
said, hey, I can think of a technique to give you

02:09.152 --> 02:15.557
that answer. And the surface pressure of Mars was a 
very good example of that problem.

02:25.606 --> 02:27.687
What do you think of the future of planetary 
astronomy? Is it going downhill?

02:35.703 --> 02:42.632
The answer to that is I think that the problems are 
becoming more difficult.

02:47.138 --> 03:04.039
I think that the type of problems that interest 
most astronomers

02:47.138 --> 03:04.039
are no longer relevant in the planetary area, but I 
think that there are many problems that interest

03:05.707 --> 03:08.350
related fields are becoming more important.

03:12.114 --> 03:27.189
For example, there are things associated with, 
let's say, volcanology on Io

03:12.114 --> 03:27.189
that are becoming important, but most 
astronomers aren't interested in volcanology.

03:31.153 --> 03:34.937
I think that there are a large number of problems 
that can be worked on the planets that we didn't

03:36.217 --> 03:44.649
consider significant before because we didn't 
have the ground truth that has come as a result of

03:36.217 --> 03:44.649
the spacecraft. But now that we know what's 
actually happening on a planet, we can go back and

03:46.772 --> 03:57.128
learn how to interpret our telescopic 
observations. I think there's another area, and

03:59.110 --> 04:05.700
that is high resolution imaging, high resolution 
infrared or spectroscopy, primarily infrared.

04:13.530 --> 04:16.793
Because that's where the absorption bands of 
interest are. Are, yeah. I think that there are a

04:19.356 --> 04:28.986
lot of problems that are coming up that can be 
approached with new technologies,

04:19.356 --> 04:28.986
and we can do a lot of work on them. For example, if we 
can get reasonably high-resolution images of a

04:35.768 --> 04:37.010
planet like Jupiter. There's a lot of meteorology

04:37.931 --> 04:43.540
that can be done on Jupiter. In that line, I noticed 
that

04:45.784 --> 05:03.632
the CCD images they've taken of Mars really look 
like Mars does when you have a good telescope and a

04:45.784 --> 05:03.632
good site and a good night, and you see all this 
detail but never able to photograph it because you

05:03.916 --> 05:06.599
couldn't beat the seeing in the old days. And you 
get this variegated appearance which looks kind

05:07.320 --> 05:18.612
of strangely familiar to me, but it's just another 
example on a very obvious level of look what we can

05:07.320 --> 05:18.612
see. And we've mentioned Jupiter with that sort of 
stuff where before it all had to be visual because

05:18.652 --> 05:26.080
they couldn't photograph it and make a permanent 
reference. And the other thing is we didn't know

05:26.521 --> 05:28.843
what it was we were looking at. of things that they 
saw on the surface, for example, of Jupiter, that

05:30.258 --> 05:39.147
they didn't know whether they were optical 
illusions or something actually there. We know

05:39.628 --> 05:46.735
now, in many cases, there were features that were 
there which we can use as tracers.

05:49.398 --> 05:57.767
But we are able to do things like three-tenths of an 
arc second at times with some of the telescopes,

05:49.398 --> 05:57.767
depending on the site. But with new 
instrumentation, we may be able to do that well on a

05:58.321 --> 06:06.312
continuous basis, if not even a little better than 
that. And if you can do that, there are a lot of

06:06.332 --> 06:09.035
problems that you can solve. There's been a lot of 
talk for the last 10 or 20 years, as a matter of fact,

06:11.459 --> 06:18.028
about the practical importance of planetary 
astronomy. The Earth is a planet.

06:22.534 --> 06:28.041
And in the last couple of years, there's been a 
whole lot of attention, at least in the popular

06:22.534 --> 06:28.041
press, to kill our asteroids and comets and things 
like that. Do you think that's overdone, or do you

06:31.284 --> 06:37.111
think that we ought to try and get every buck we can? 
Oh. Again, it's purely a subjective opinion

06:41.496 --> 06:49.766
question, but there's no objective way of 
answering it. No, I think that some of these things

06:49.786 --> 06:55.513
are important to study. I don't think, for 
example, killer asteroids, they say that the ones

06:58.042 --> 07:06.652
that are going to hit us and do some damage we will 
never even see. And if you do see them, they'll be so

07:06.672 --> 07:12.639
close that you don't have any time to do anything 
about them. But like everything else, I don't know

07:14.522 --> 07:24.554
of any situation where more knowledge has hurt us.

07:24.574 --> 07:26.496
I know it gets a lot of popularity some of these 
things. But I think that there is some good, valid,

07:29.089 --> 07:38.417
beneficial use that comes from studying some of 
this stuff. And the cost of studying it is

07:38.437 --> 07:43.622
negligible compared to the cost of a lot of other 
programs. My concern is this, that if there is a

07:43.642 --> 07:55.572
demise of planetary or solar system exploration 
with spacecraft, it's going to be very difficult

07:43.642 --> 07:55.572
to try to get the funds necessary to continue a 
significant program in planetary astronomy.

08:02.881 --> 08:03.923
That brings up a point. How much of an impact on 
funding do you think the fact that there is no

08:04.864 --> 08:12.815
evidence whatsoever of life on Mars has had?

08:23.129 --> 08:25.052
That's a difficult question to answer. If they 
would have found one organic molecule, do you

08:25.150 --> 08:29.456
think we would have had more probes? The answer to 
that is probably not that much different.

08:37.728 --> 08:45.159
I think we are still interested in pursuing 
examination of Mars for possible life forms. I

08:45.520 --> 08:54.853
think that, you know,

08:45.520 --> 08:54.853
maybe not the way we did it with the Viking mission, 
but I think that there is still an interest there.

08:55.171 --> 08:57.353
There certainly is an interest in Mars. Now, if 
this creature on Mars keeps devouring our

08:59.476 --> 09:06.123
spacecraft and we quit, we might find out 
something. That brings up a point. The loss of the

09:08.025 --> 09:23.983
Mars Observer, from what I could tell, came as 
quite a shock to a lot of the scientists and

09:08.025 --> 09:23.983
engineers involved, but we both go back far enough 
to remember the sixties when Ranger One through

09:08.025 --> 09:23.983
Six failed their Air One family. You'd think this 
was a a useful, if you will, slap in the face at

09:27.284 --> 09:30.687
overconfident people?

09:36.332 --> 09:39.014
Maybe, yes, but I think it's also a danger. It's a 
very dangerous one. You know, we've often said,

09:41.917 --> 09:51.004
does success

09:41.917 --> 09:51.004
bring success or does failure bring success? And 
with success, I mean the latter part of that is more

09:53.046 --> 09:56.329
money. more programs. If you have a successful 
program, there's a tendency by the powers that be

09:58.345 --> 10:05.015
that says, well, you've learned what you wanted to 
learn. Let's turn our efforts to something else.

10:09.001 --> 10:21.019
And so when you have a failure, there's quite often 
the position that, gee, you know, it's too bad, but

10:09.001 --> 10:21.019
we should really follow up. And we'll probably get 
another Mars mission for just that reason. It may

10:26.431 --> 10:34.343
have been harder if this mission had been 
successful to get another Mars mission than if

10:26.431 --> 10:34.343
this had been a failure. A good example of that is 
Space Telescope.

10:43.858 --> 10:45.381
So it's hard to say.

10:50.769 --> 10:54.615
I don't know, and this is sort of off the record, are 
now saying, hey, you better look at plans for

10:55.979 --> 11:06.913
another Mars observer or one that can do part of the 
mission of Mars that Mars observer was for.

11:07.454 --> 11:11.078
Nobody's canceled the measure pathfinder 
mission yet. We're still going ahead with measure

11:12.420 --> 11:14.563
network. So it hasn't brought an end to the 
program. The thing that concerns me is that at the

11:19.249 --> 11:24.315
time when a space program does come to an end, that 
the ground-based program, which is still capable

11:25.291 --> 11:36.887
of producing tremendous results, is probably 
going to lose funding as well. And the

11:39.210 --> 11:43.957
ground-based stuff, of course, information 
comes much cheaper than anything. There's no

11:44.497 --> 11:45.679
comparison. Yes, that's one of the things I want to 
do. There's been endless books written about all

11:49.161 --> 11:56.990
the wonderful things that Viking and Voyager have 
done, but most of our information on the planets

11:49.161 --> 11:56.990
still comes from the ground. Would you agree? 
Well, not really. Of course, there's a lot of stuff

12:02.956 --> 12:05.479
we've never seen. No. The information that we got 
from the spacecraft, you cannot get any other way

12:06.160 --> 12:12.527
than from the spacecraft.

12:14.887 --> 12:16.329
Which is the way it's supposed to be. Which is the 
way it is supposed to be. However, the fact that

12:19.332 --> 12:33.609
we've got all this good information from a 
spacecraft does not nullify the need for

12:19.332 --> 12:33.609
ground-based observations and, in fact, 
increases the value of ground-based

12:19.332 --> 12:33.609
observations. Just thinking that now that we 
know... Yes.

12:38.635 --> 12:38.835
Excuse me. I was just going to say that once you find 
out something from a spacecraft, you often find

12:38.855 --> 12:43.240
out that really need a spacecraft. I'm thinking of 
the great dark spot on Neptune. Now that we know

12:47.262 --> 12:54.071
it's there, people are looking at old visual 
drawings of Neptune and finding it. Oh, yes. Well,

12:55.513 --> 12:56.294
that's it. As soon as you know what the ground truth 
is, you don't necessarily have to keep repeating

12:56.314 --> 13:02.343
it. Now, it is true that we would like to know at 
greater resolution what the surface looks like,

13:03.805 --> 13:11.415
but Jupiter is an excellent example. We can study 
the motions in the Jovian atmosphere features

13:13.898 --> 13:20.985
down to a certain size quite well from the ground. 
And if you had something like the space telescope,

13:21.906 --> 13:24.348
extremely well. The volcanic activity on Io is 
studied not continuously, but on quite a

13:26.190 --> 13:35.719
continuous basis from the Earth. Look at comets. 
Now that we know what a comet looks like, and how the

13:42.738 --> 13:55.450
emissions from a comet take place, we can learn a 
lot more about comets from the ground than we were

13:42.738 --> 13:55.450
ever able to in the past. The same thing, I'm sure, 
is going to be true about asteroids. So the value of

14:00.195 --> 14:07.642
ground-based astronomy has not been diminished 
but has been increased.

14:10.765 --> 14:12.407
Let me switch to a different topic I've asked this 
because I was looking at this part of your records

14:12.623 --> 14:24.962
yesterday at the NASA history office, and there 
was a big funding crunch in 1973. I mean, your

14:25.142 --> 14:31.351
budget had been going up, and then slam-bang, it 
started to go down. What was that like?

14:37.020 --> 14:40.605
Well, it was disaster, of course. because many of 
the programs that were going along and growing had

14:41.108 --> 14:47.457
to be cut back. Many less people were funded. At 
that time, we started our abortion, if you will, of

14:49.941 --> 15:00.015
planetary astronomers, and I never really 
recovered from that. So I'm trying to think of

15:02.038 --> 15:07.807
something that was specifically affected at that 
time. Me. Well, you was one thing. But we did have

15:10.994 --> 15:17.003
some very severe cutbacks in NASA. We had some 
severe cutbacks in what we could do. One of the

15:20.047 --> 15:30.983
things, for example, that we wanted to do when we 
built the IRTF is to equip it with the best

15:20.047 --> 15:30.983
instrumentation possible. Because of budget 
cuts, we had to stop building any instrumentation

15:31.764 --> 15:36.190
for it. So what we're working with today is last 
decade's instrumentation. And it's very

15:45.879 --> 15:51.925
expensive to do it, because you're having to do 
stuff with the instrumentation that's not as

15:45.879 --> 15:51.925
good. It takes far longer to do the job, and it just 
is not satisfactory. It ends up by costing you much

15:57.870 --> 16:04.657
more money than it would if you could do it with 
today's technology.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.443
Based on your experience, do you think that NASA in 
general over-manages science, under-manages

16:12.200 --> 16:16.864
science, does it about right? From a personal 
point of view, I think it depends very much on the

16:19.347 --> 16:26.013
type of program. In the case of data analysis,

16:27.794 --> 16:33.540
I think we do it about right. People write 
proposals. The proposals are reviewed by their

16:37.764 --> 16:40.266
peers. We fund one of them we can. I think that there 
is some good work that we don't fund. I think

16:46.568 --> 16:59.008
there's also some poor work that gets proposed by 
good scientists and sometimes does get funded,

16:46.568 --> 16:59.008
but that's the way the dice comes up. But I think 
that there are programs where we are trying to look

16:59.929 --> 17:08.683
for new things that money is wasted because the 
programs are not managed closely enough and i

17:09.068 --> 17:36.122
don't think in these cases that people are to blame 
many people go down the wrong path unknowingly

17:09.068 --> 17:36.122
because somebody isn't taking a look at it and 
saying hey wait a second is that really the way you

17:09.068 --> 17:36.122
want to go not that they want to be directed

17:39.038 --> 17:44.544
But I think we have to stay on top of and take an 
overview of many things in order to do it properly.

17:45.686 --> 17:54.155
I've heard a lot of comments that with flight 
missions in particular, NASA shows the pretty

17:45.686 --> 17:54.155
pictures and then chops off the data analysis. 
What do you think about that? We chop off the data

17:57.399 --> 18:01.023
analysis only when we cannot get any more money. We 
are just, I have been responsible for the program.

18:08.572 --> 18:09.012
Which is? Neptune Data Analysis Program, and 
that's basically Voyager data analysis. We are

18:14.251 --> 18:26.566
now in our fourth year of that, and that is after the 
first year or two in which the investigators were

18:14.251 --> 18:26.566
supported, and that's being funded at a level of on 
the order of $3 million a year. Now, we would have

18:26.987 --> 18:34.916
liked to have funded it earlier for more money, 
let's say $5 million a year, $6 million a year, and

18:26.987 --> 18:34.916
done it. I think there's still a lot of good data 
that can be taken out of it. I think that there are

18:39.367 --> 18:43.411
gaps, and what I mean by gaps is this. I personally 
have been heavily involved in the Voyager mission

18:46.113 --> 18:55.082
since I've been the Voyager program scientist for 
the Uranus and Neptune encounters.

18:59.046 --> 19:08.074
We can know a lot more about Jupiter and Saturn 
today because of material we have learned about

18:59.046 --> 19:08.074
Uranus and Neptune. We do not have a legitimate 
data analysis program on either Jupiter or Saturn

19:09.758 --> 19:17.305
or on the outer planets as a whole. What we have a 
program for right now is to reduce the data that we

19:18.787 --> 19:24.512
got at Neptune.

19:28.356 --> 19:37.305
But as a scientist, you can understand that 
something we learned at Neptune, they say to

19:28.356 --> 19:37.305
somebody, hey, wait a second. If we do the same 
analysis on Uranus, We're going to get some very

19:40.488 --> 19:45.435
important information out about Uranus and about 
the other planets in general. We have to say to

19:46.356 --> 19:53.726
them, sorry, but unless you can tie it into 
Neptune, we can't support you under this program.

19:55.288 --> 20:08.166
So there are areas where, I would say after the 
fact, you might want to come back and take a new look

19:55.288 --> 20:08.166
at some old data. we have not always been able to do 
that because we just don't have the money in the

20:08.686 --> 20:12.892
programs. Yeah, on interviewing myself when I was 
at headquarters, I really did run into the problem

20:14.374 --> 20:24.188
you did of having lots of money. In fact, that's 
where the original idea came from to build the

20:24.668 --> 20:38.187
telescopes at Texas and Hawaii was that I guess Bob 
Bryson and somebody else had like four million

20:24.668 --> 20:38.187
dollars that they couldn't spend like lunar 
geology. And, of course, you don't want to turn

20:39.885 --> 20:42.168
money back. You've got to spend it. So Roger Moore 
found this out, and I went to Ernie Liddell, and he

20:43.430 --> 20:49.638
went to Orrin, and we said, look, we found a way to 
spend this money. And we couldn't get people to

20:50.099 --> 20:55.367
take the money, which is ridiculous. Pete Orrin's 
going to kill me for this, but I told him back in

20:55.387 --> 21:07.684
January that if he can do what he says he's going to 
do with Clementine for the amount of money there's

20:55.387 --> 21:07.684
going to be hell to pay at NASA, The reason I bring 
this up is there's a lot of talk about they're going

21:08.322 --> 21:12.568
to dismantle NASA and so forth. And I don't know 
which side I'm on because I worked for NASA, worked

21:13.951 --> 21:25.288
at headquarters, but the Air Force paved my way 
through my Ph.D. and supported me at Aerospace

21:13.951 --> 21:25.288
Corporation.

21:26.990 --> 21:28.413
Do you see any big changes? Again, this is 
subjective, but you're not working for the agency

21:29.214 --> 21:36.625
anymore, so I don't even know if it will be in the 
book, but I'm curious. One of the things that

21:37.718 --> 21:46.510
bothers me about Clementine is that everybody is 
touting it as to how wonderful a program you can do

21:37.718 --> 21:46.510
for a very little expense. I told Gordon, I said, 
you can't even build a flight-qualified

21:47.291 --> 21:52.057
spectrograph for $55 million. Okay. The 
difficulty is they don't realize all the money

21:54.140 --> 22:05.194
that's been spent bringing everything up to the 
status it has today to be put into Clementine. We

22:06.710 --> 22:13.981
could not start from scratch, like NASA has to do, 
and fly Clementine for the price that they're

22:06.710 --> 22:13.981
flying it for. It's the fact that there's millions 
and millions and millions of them. In fact, a

22:17.927 --> 22:19.250
hundred million. I don't know how much into these 
specific instruments, but there's been a lot of

22:19.790 --> 22:30.787
money going into these things, which they're able 
to assemble relatively inexpensively and fly

22:19.790 --> 22:30.787
relatively inexpensively. And I think it's very 
misleading.

22:36.646 --> 22:38.308
Do you think NASA has a future?

22:42.752 --> 22:44.834
I think it has a very good future. I think it—well, 
let me back off for a moment. Does it have the

22:50.699 --> 22:52.681
potential for a future? The answer to that is yes. 
There are many very good things you can do in space,

22:57.545 --> 23:04.932
and you can do it relatively When I say relatively 
inexpensively, you don't have to spend $10

23:05.367 --> 23:09.112
billion a year. You might be able to get by for $4 
billion a year. You're not going to get by for a few

23:12.536 --> 23:15.600
hundred million dollars a year. On the other hand, 
is NASA going to survive by budget, off the budget,

23:17.622 --> 23:25.672
Congress? I don't know. I think it has some real 
serious problems there. From Fred Whipple and

23:31.557 --> 23:46.935
Gerard de Bacolor and down, the opinion that I've 
gotten so far from, I don't know, at least 30 people

23:31.557 --> 23:46.935
on the record is that NASA money was absolutely 
crucial to the rebirth of modern planetary

23:31.557 --> 23:46.935
astronomy. Oh, absolutely. There's no question 
about it. It was planetary astronomy. In fact, it

23:51.701 --> 23:53.283
was very strange. Sitting in this desk, or not this 
desk, but the desk I had from 1964, I was planetary

23:53.543 --> 24:00.231
astronomy in the United States.

24:03.029 --> 24:05.693
It was a very small field then, wasn't it? You knew 
everybody. No, but it grew. And it's amazing to me

24:08.898 --> 24:13.725
today to meet people and say, hey, you are 
responsible. You are responsible for me being

24:14.126 --> 24:32.293
what I am today, because it was the money that you 
gave in this grant to this institution that

24:14.126 --> 24:32.293
allowed me to have, you know, a postdoc or graduate 
student support or something else in planetary

24:14.126 --> 24:32.293
astronomy. Not only that, but you realize that 
Hawaii, Texas, Arizona, there's a tremendous

24:32.527 --> 24:51.205
amount of research being done with instruments 
that NASA built. We didn't physically build them,

24:52.767 --> 24:59.613
but we provided the funds for them, and they've 
been very beneficial. I mean, it's absolutely

24:59.633 --> 25:01.335
amazing to me. The community, the non-planetary 
infrared community, complained bitterly about

25:01.805 --> 25:08.556
the IRTF.

25:11.821 --> 25:14.405
They still complain bitterly about the IRTF. 
Their complaint now is they don't get enough time

25:14.425 --> 25:16.548
on it. Okay. But for a long time they complained 
bitterly because it was a waste of money as far as

25:19.252 --> 25:27.525
they could see, and while it might be useful for 
some planetary astronomers, who didn't do decent

25:27.927 --> 25:36.018
science anyway, there was no good science could be 
done with that telescope.

25:36.038 --> 25:39.270
Gee, there was one other question I wanted to ask.
