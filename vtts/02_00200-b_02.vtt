WEBVTT

00:02.798 --> 00:07.273
Well,

00:02.798 --> 00:07.273
let's see. What were the benefits of being 
president of the student body? You didn't get a

00:14.336 --> 00:16.302
scholarship. Just the opportunity to work with 
some of the best on campus and the opportunity to

00:17.210 --> 00:28.345
get exposure to the other universities. Those 
were the purposes. Alright, as you look back on it,

00:30.547 --> 00:37.817
of what are you most proud from that year as student 
body president?

00:41.088 --> 00:42.570
Or student senate president, I should say. 
Probably our work with SCONA and with the other

00:42.590 --> 00:50.321
universities and having the opportunity to meet 
them.

00:55.988 --> 01:05.101
We didn't have any major campus turmoil that we 
dealt with that stands out that I remember. What

01:06.062 --> 01:10.588
was your impression of Earl Rudder then as the new 
president? Well, he became president the year

01:11.497 --> 01:17.908
after I, he was vice president.

01:26.003 --> 01:28.527
I knew him more as, someone who we babysit for than 
someone who was president. I know that there was a,

01:38.143 --> 01:49.722
at that time, concern over what kind of leadership 
he would provide not being an academician. but

01:50.461 --> 01:56.813
surprised most people at the qualitative 
decisions. A lot of the decisions, of course,

01:57.935 --> 02:05.449
weren't known even to the community, the faculty 
staff, Things were run different back then. Was it

02:09.036 --> 02:13.282
pretty clearly understood that he was going to 
become the president soon? It was pretty clearly

02:13.702 --> 02:16.486
understood that he was boss. Okay, that's what I, 
that's what I thought. It didn't matter what you

02:19.810 --> 02:21.252
called him. He made, he made many of the decisions 
that were important. And that if you didn't agree

02:28.598 --> 02:38.247
with him, you needed to go to TU or SMU or TCU, 
somewhere else. Different world. There were no

02:41.189 --> 02:50.398
incidents that caused you and other student 
leaders to get called in and say, here's a problem,

02:41.189 --> 02:50.398
you all solve it? No. I don't ever remember 
visiting either the president's office or the

02:50.498 --> 02:56.243
vice president, any administrator's office. We 
worked with Dean Penberthy on campus issues. Who

03:03.142 --> 03:05.905
were the other key student leaders? The corps 
commander. Corps staff. Don Cloud, as seniors,

03:11.712 --> 03:15.077
was the corps commander. Gary Pepper was 
president of the senior class. Joe Buescher was

03:23.707 --> 03:26.010
editor of the battalion. Rod Stepp was the editor 
of the Aggieland. These were people that you

03:29.699 --> 03:42.343
worked with on campus problems, solving them, 
that you saw frequently in meetings or sessions.

03:42.363 --> 03:43.425
Let's see. your whole four years give some 
examples of some good bulls, some pranks, some

03:43.726 --> 03:51.793
jokes that you were aware of. Well, of course, the 
biggest activity were drowned outs, either where

03:52.214 --> 04:02.003
you would pick an individual, junior or senior, 
and in a few cases sophomores. And there were

04:02.283 --> 04:12.332
certainly tricks of not getting caught and of 
doing the job extremely well. Every now and then we

04:12.802 --> 04:26.592
had Babo bombs but not very often and usually two or 
three times a year usually during dead week just

04:12.802 --> 04:26.592
before finals in the fall and spring you'd have a 
the whole core area around Duncan or around

04:27.095 --> 04:35.746
Speedy's, every dorm would get involved in these 
huge water fights. The whole, everything. Where

04:38.549 --> 04:39.530
would they take place? Out there in the quadrangle 
in front of the dorms. Throwing? In the units,

04:43.956 --> 04:47.340
whenever you drowned somebody out, you'd drown 
them out in their room. And usually that occurred

04:48.361 --> 04:55.009
when they had gone to sleep and you'd take about 
three freshmen with their waist back waste

04:55.411 --> 05:01.636
baskets full of water and dump them and then lock 
the door so he couldn't get out. So you'd dump it on

05:02.177 --> 05:05.079
him in bed? In bed. It wasn't one of these where you 
leaned it against the door? No, no. You dumped it on

05:10.164 --> 05:25.097
him and then you had someone with a fuck stick on the 
door and when you'd get out then they'd lock the

05:10.164 --> 05:25.097
door where he couldn't get out and you'd go back to 
your room and try to make sure that nobody could

05:10.164 --> 05:25.097
trace to who had done it. But the dead week, we'd 
always have everybody would be involved. I mean,

05:32.285 --> 05:34.928
water would be flying everywhere. Most of it 
occurred out in the quadrangle rather than in the

05:35.489 --> 05:38.673
dorms. But you'd have every faucet on that first 
floor running full steam and people in line to fill

05:39.535 --> 05:46.123
up wastebaskets. Now, the Babbo bomb, was that 
normally rolled into the room, open the door and

05:46.964 --> 05:54.494
roll it in there? Yeah. Either that or they'd walk 
it in and light it in the room, depending on whether

05:55.469 --> 06:02.627
the individual was asleep or awake. Okay. Did you 
normally, was a Babel bomb used while the person

06:04.872 --> 06:10.727
was in the room? Or did you ever do it? Sometimes 
either way. Sometimes you just ruin it. Your

06:15.835 --> 06:19.098
objective was to really mess up the room. Other 
times it was to get a rise out of the individual. And

06:23.482 --> 06:24.663
you always were asleep. You wouldn't do it if they 
were sitting up studying. Did anybody ever put an

06:28.446 --> 06:32.450
animal in somebody else's room in your days? Oh, 
yeah. What? That was the only situation for us old

06:34.512 --> 06:41.558
country boys had the upper hand on kids from 
Houston. because they hadn't been around snakes

06:42.027 --> 06:57.657
and armadillos and the like and so there was a great 
deal of concern about how much damage one of those

06:42.027 --> 06:57.657
animals could do if you weren't really familiar 
with them so it was not uncommon to put a snake in

06:58.143 --> 07:01.487
between the sheets. What variety of snake? Well, 
generally garden snakes because even though we

07:02.669 --> 07:08.076
were boastful, we weren't dumb. We didn't have a 
rattlesnake. I had a freshman, Ed Hill. In fact, he

07:13.984 --> 07:18.430
worked down here before he passed away here about 
three years ago. But Ed was a herpetology major,

07:19.169 --> 07:26.479
wildlife sciences major, and he kept snakes in 
gallon jars in his room. And nothing was more

07:27.401 --> 07:36.594
exciting than for Ed to walk out in the hall and 
announce that he couldn't find his rattlesnake.

07:36.614 --> 07:42.302
Everybody got bricks and put up beneath their 
doors where there wouldn't be any opening at all.

07:43.183 --> 07:47.910
But we'd just take and slip those snakes in between 
the sheets. and then just quietly wake, tried to

07:48.953 --> 07:59.224
not be observable till the light went out in the 
room and then just listen. They'd always found

08:00.165 --> 08:01.406
that snake. Sometimes it took a while for people to 
slide in bed before that snake moved or before they

08:01.446 --> 08:08.474
contacted. But you could always tell the minute 
they realized what it was or that it was something.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.362
Where would you all get the snakes? No, they were 
all around out here on campus, Brightest River.

08:20.345 --> 08:21.086
You'd just catch them. And you mentioned 
armadillo. Did they ever put an armadillo in

08:22.768 --> 08:25.612
somebody's room? Yeah. What else? Those were the 
two primary targets with snakes and armadillos.

08:34.324 --> 08:39.671
Did anybody ever put a cow or a sheep in anybody's 
room? I'm sure that happened. Not that I recall in

08:42.215 --> 08:44.037
our outfits. Because I had one old-timer in one of 
the Northgate. They put a cow in somebody's room on

08:48.318 --> 08:54.386
Friday, and it was there all weekend on the fourth 
floor. And he said, you think it was hard getting

08:55.307 --> 08:58.171
that cow up. Wait till you try to get that cow down, 
where the head shifts that center of gravity.

09:07.903 --> 09:08.344
Let's see. That was before elevators. Yes, yes, 
yes. In any dog. Was there a fish day in your era? We

09:16.062 --> 09:23.732
had a fish day that we were essentially to treat 
sophomores like freshmen and vice versa.

09:24.854 --> 09:27.798
Describe how that went as you remember. Well, we 
knew that that was only one day, so we never did get

09:27.818 --> 09:37.692
really wild about the treatment of sophomores. It 
usually had to do with hitting braces and... doing

09:45.172 --> 10:13.187
push-ups and simple stuff because we didn't have 
the opportunity to get even it never occurred

09:45.172 --> 10:13.187
because if you're a freshman the sophomores 
junior and senior were going to always be ahead of

09:45.172 --> 10:13.187
you now a year ahead of you was a young man named ray 
bowen yes he was over in the air force and i don't

09:45.172 --> 10:13.187
really remember ray except on student senate He 
was a senior when I was a junior on the student

10:13.572 --> 10:18.696
center. What kind of a student did he seem to be?

10:24.541 --> 10:38.534
Ray was serious and he was an engineer so I didn't 
have a lot of contact with him and don't have a lot of

10:24.541 --> 10:38.534
memory other than I did remember Ray Bowen when it 
was announced that he was named president. I had to

10:38.774 --> 10:42.617
go to my A-land to recall what he looked like. Were 
there any other, you mentioned some, who were some

10:44.875 --> 10:57.409
of the student celebrities, people that would 
later become well-known that were here when you

10:44.875 --> 10:57.409
were? Well, of course, Davis Ford was president of 
the association. Bully Fernandez was president

11:04.376 --> 11:06.899
of the association. He's my roommate. You called 
Bully? Well, Raul. No, but no, but Bully? Bully,

11:12.175 --> 11:13.157
yep. That's what, I didn't know he had another name 
until we were out of school. Where'd you get the

11:17.363 --> 11:18.385
Bully? Can't tell you. It came here with him. Oh, 
really? Okay, all right. Whenever, he was Fish

11:24.935 --> 11:29.342
Fernandez for a year, and then he was Bully for 
three years. And he was your roommate for?

11:31.986 --> 11:34.290
Sophomore and junior year. Right. How were 
Hispanics treated during those years? We didn't

11:39.348 --> 11:40.329
know the difference. I didn't know what a Hispanic 
was. I knew he was from Laredo. I figured he was a

11:44.534 --> 11:49.461
little darker than I was because they got more sun 
down there. But Bully was just another Aggie.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.013
In general, describe the student body. They were 
all male, but They were from what kind of towns,

12:01.471 --> 12:05.638
what kind of families and income? Probably over 
half of them came from small towns. You still had a

12:09.285 --> 12:17.459
significant number of kids from Dallas, Fort 
Worth, and Houston. Don't remember that many from

12:17.599 --> 12:21.405
San Antone, Austin. Over half of our kids in our 
outfit were from small towns. Bullets from

12:27.408 --> 12:39.424
Laredo, we had two kids from Mount Pleasant, from 
Wheeler, Wellington, three of the kids from

12:27.408 --> 12:39.424
Gatesville. And most of them from parents that had 
not gone to college? I would say the majority were.

12:48.457 --> 12:48.697
Were? Not college graduates. Most of them came and

12:56.585 --> 13:04.316
A bunch of them came, I mean they had no idea when 
they graduated from high school they were even

12:56.585 --> 13:04.316
going to college. Many of them decided in August 
because they couldn't find a job or they couldn't

13:04.336 --> 13:19.538
find anything else to do or someone suggested that 
they might want to try A&M, just showed up at the

13:04.336 --> 13:19.538
door last August. And what did you and your buddies 
assume were, in fact, the rules about classroom

13:20.429 --> 13:28.662
behavior? I know there weren't any written rules, 
but what did y'all? Well,

13:33.028 --> 13:49.153
I don't know that we ever thought about it because 
you went to class and you listened and the staff

13:33.028 --> 13:49.153
were kind of like mom and dad. Did y'all ever do any 
pranks in class? No. Not until we got, until I

13:55.605 --> 14:02.294
became a graduate student, and then things 
loosened up some. But there was a certain element

14:02.314 --> 14:06.138
of fear. How often did you go to class? How often did 
you go to class? Every time it met. Unless I had flu,

14:12.446 --> 14:17.773
we had a flu epidemic my sophomore year. Did you go 
to Quack Shack? Yeah, that's where the military

14:21.202 --> 14:22.467
science was. Where was it? Well, it was over in the 
old barracks on the north part of campus. Describe

14:29.127 --> 14:32.050
it physically. They were two-story barracks. 
They were tar paper outside and wood holding the

14:34.573 --> 14:39.177
tar paper from falling in on itself. And you had 
these wooden chairs with the arm where you set your

14:39.878 --> 14:46.305
books and did your note taking. Who was the, do you 
remember the doctors?

14:52.631 --> 14:54.053
Oh, you're talking about the hospital. I'm 
talking about where military science was held.

14:56.375 --> 14:57.336
Oh, no, no, no. Okay. Quack Shack was the hospital, 
so to speak, over at where they have the services

14:58.490 --> 15:08.184
building now. And it was a two-story, I believe, 
brick building. And I was over there probably

15:13.731 --> 15:19.339
twice the four years I was here. I heard a lot of 
stories about it. I didn't spend any time over at

15:25.709 --> 15:29.714
Black Shack. Who was the doctor, do you remember? 
Don't remember. And you could, if you were sick

15:33.899 --> 15:38.365
enough, you could spend the night there. Oh, yes. 
They had probably 12 or 13 beds, and whenever a flu

15:39.146 --> 15:45.995
or something like that hit, you were taken care of 
in the dorm. The COs and the first sergeant would go

15:46.876 --> 15:53.644
over and get medicine and bring it and distribute 
it. Your... fish your sophomore buddies would

15:55.274 --> 16:22.648
bring food to the dorm from the mess hall and in a 
week you'd either die or get well

15:55.274 --> 16:22.648
but it it wasn't a large place that could handle a 
lot of people and I can remember the two times that I

15:55.274 --> 16:22.648
can remember going over there of spending well 
over an hour sitting and waiting to see anyone So,

16:23.287 --> 16:29.600
it was, it wasn't a place that you couldn't wait 
until the next time to go back. Alright. Now,

16:30.842 --> 16:36.974
during these four busy years for you, did you 
continue to work? Yes. How much? How many hours?

16:40.782 --> 16:49.201
About 20 hours during the summers, during the 
terms of fall and spring, and then full time in the

16:40.782 --> 16:49.201
summer. In entomology? Yes. Worked at the lab for 
two years, and then I, in 1957, was hired as

16:51.366 --> 16:58.862
extension entomologist at Lubbock. Guy 
Carpenter, who was the area entomologist out

16:59.956 --> 17:05.942
there, was killed in a airplane. Right, now you're 
doing this in the summer and then come back? I was

17:10.307 --> 17:24.421
located in the basement of the AG building on the 
Tech campus where the district office was and

17:10.307 --> 17:24.421
worked with the county agents and the whole High 
Plains and Rolling Plains area on cotton insects

17:10.307 --> 17:24.421
primarily, wrote a newsletter. Here on campus, 
how much did your pay increased during those four

17:28.205 --> 17:30.027
years?

17:33.251 --> 17:37.876
I think about 75 cents is what I made when I was a 
senior. From 17 cents to about 75 cents. The thing

17:41.941 --> 17:50.591
that I learned later when I went to work full-time, 
now I just worked summers as extension

17:41.941 --> 17:50.591
neurologist out there. Danes used me just to fill 
in during the heat of the cotton season. That's

17:56.298 --> 17:58.060
when everybody was under pressure. but I got my 
first full-time job as extension entomologist

17:59.035 --> 18:22.933
area entomologist at Lubbock June 1 of 1960 and I 
didn't know it until I my

17:59.035 --> 18:22.933
dad passed away and I was going through some of his 
records and I was hired for more than he made and he

18:23.234 --> 18:35.669
was working for the same organization and had been 
for 20 something years, since 42, and this was in

18:23.234 --> 18:35.669
1960, 28 years. And what was your starting pay? Six 
thousand dollars, 500 a month, which I thought was

18:38.552 --> 18:45.441
just unheard of. And we got Three cents a mile for a 
mileage, and our per dime for our lodging and meals

18:48.428 --> 18:56.519
was six dollars a day. Sounds like a cushy deal. 
That's right. But you know, we got by. Now, let's

19:05.110 --> 19:07.353
back up. Did you meet a special young lady during 
your student days here? I met a bunch of them. Met my

19:15.783 --> 19:16.864
wife. I had known her, but we had not dated in high 
school. And she was at OCW, and we started dating

19:22.629 --> 19:29.815
when I was a junior here at A&M. And then she 
transferred to TU. Okay. And how would you visit

19:33.939 --> 19:40.084
with her after she gets to Austin? About once a 
month. Well, of course, in the fall, football

19:42.026 --> 19:44.068
game. she would come over here sometimes with 
friends of hers that were in the same dorm and

19:44.437 --> 20:07.609
sometimes on a bus and that was an experience I 
understand I never rode the bus but there was a bus

19:44.437 --> 20:07.609
that went from Austin down through the bottom 
through Brenham and all the country roads and as I

20:08.281 --> 20:27.994
understand it was driven by a fellow that had grown 
up down here in the Bravis bottoms and enjoyed

20:08.281 --> 20:27.994
telling people about every tree and every 
historical site and even would stop at his house

20:08.281 --> 20:27.994
and go in and have his supper and then come back out 
and finish the trip. When you were dating this

20:28.835 --> 20:36.726
special young lady, where would y'all go on Friday 
and Saturday nights here? There were activities

20:36.806 --> 20:39.310
here. There wasn't any place, but if it was a 
football game, we went to the football game. There

20:45.238 --> 20:50.766
was usually some kind of a dance or activity at the 
MSC after it. And that's where we went. Alright, if

20:53.550 --> 20:57.576
you wanted to go somewhere after the dance,

21:00.290 --> 21:03.175
to eat, to have refreshments where? That was very 
simple. There was Zarape's, if you wanted Mexican

21:06.020 --> 21:10.168
food, and there was Werman's. Zarape's was over 
here east of the campus near the water tower. There

21:14.936 --> 21:16.259
used to be a water tower there. Werman's was 
downtown Bryan, had chicken fried steaks. And

21:22.008 --> 21:28.897
then there was a seafood place over on Old College, 
and I can't recall what the name of that. Were there

21:29.377 --> 21:37.428
any places that young people might have gone that 
were a little bit on the edge of respectability?

21:40.912 --> 21:41.713
I'm sure there were. Was Uncle Ed's still going? 
Yes, Uncle Ed's existed. I had never been to Uncle

21:47.607 --> 21:54.677
Ed's, so I don't know whether that was a place that 
you just went and got beer like across the Bryce

21:47.607 --> 21:54.677
River Bridge. So you didn't take your date there? I 
had never been there. Did you ever go to Whiskey

21:59.603 --> 22:01.846
Bridge across the? I knew where it was because 
that's where I work. Entomology had experiments

22:04.390 --> 22:11.179
down there, so I'd always pass it just as you went 
across the bridge on your right. What did it look

22:11.239 --> 22:13.082
like from there? It looked like an old shack. And as 
far as you know, what did they sell other than

22:16.700 --> 22:19.744
whiskey? As far as I knew, that's all they sold. It 
wasn't a convenience store, was it, where you

22:23.729 --> 22:28.514
could buy bread and bologna? No, no. I never was in 
there. Because it was still, when we got here, it

22:30.897 --> 22:34.101
was still there. I was trying to remember when 
Arnold's was built. I have eaten at Arnold's. in

22:46.282 --> 22:48.104
that old red brick building. I think it was here 
during that time. Barbecue. But they couldn't

22:53.070 --> 22:57.395
handle it about eight at one time, I think, if you 
sit down. All right, did you and your buddies ever

22:58.056 --> 23:01.900
go to the clay pits swimming? No, but we went to the 
river, Brass River. That's where they would have

23:05.404 --> 23:08.508
beer bus units. Describe that. Well, they'd just 
get a bunch of beer and ice it down, and we'd go out

23:09.249 --> 23:14.635
there and raise hell. And how would you all get 
there? Usually two or three people would have

23:17.242 --> 23:19.486
vehicles. And you'd fill it up with a... Everybody 
would pile in the back end of a truck. And would

23:26.917 --> 23:29.541
there be any females in the group? And what did they 
wear when they went swimming? Nothing. Their

23:35.390 --> 23:36.292
underwear. So they would wear their skivvies? 
Some wore underwear. And some skinny dipped?

23:42.902 --> 23:43.002
Yeah. How drunk did people get? Some of them had to 
be carried back. Was there care given to who was the

23:50.483 --> 23:54.089
driver on the road back? Yes. We had designated 
drivers. But you didn't use that phrase then. No,

24:00.119 --> 24:03.364
there were people who didn't drink.

24:06.389 --> 24:08.533
And this would happen normally on a? Saturday? 
Usually a Friday night. A Friday night, okay.

24:12.116 --> 24:19.566
Because football games were Saturday, and nearly 
always it was a Friday night, at least our outfit.

24:20.588 --> 24:21.048
Let's see. MSC, what role did the MSC play in a 
student's life during those years? It was the only

24:28.739 --> 24:36.069
place that had activities, a piano, bowling 
alley. It I don't know what the Y used to be like. In

24:41.929 --> 24:45.935
fact, I've never seen the swimming pool 
supposedly in the basement of the Y. Did have those

24:47.277 --> 24:50.041
B meetings at the Y. But the MSC was the living room 
of campus. Everything happened there because you

24:55.308 --> 25:07.545
didn't have other options of places to go and the 
campus theater was where movies were shown and the

24:55.308 --> 25:07.545
MSC is where everything else happened. Now did a 
student goof off, play tricks, act up in the MSC?

25:15.208 --> 25:15.409
No. That was strictly done in your room or in the 
core area. And by your day, the YMCA was not a very

25:22.388 --> 25:28.517
significant student activity center. Not at all. 
The MSC, I think, opened probably about 51 or 52,

25:29.358 --> 25:39.133
and it was well established, and it was air 
conditioned. What about... That's what most

25:40.735 --> 25:44.264
people remember about the MSC. It was the only cool 
place on campus. And by and large, sophomores did

25:48.474 --> 25:54.008
not pick on freshmen in the MSC, did they? No. 
Wasn't that kind of an often? That was a given. in

25:57.509 --> 26:10.607
the MSC that everybody was, you still spoke, you 
still hit a brace, that just happened naturally,

25:57.509 --> 26:10.607
but there was no, essentially no hazing on the MSC. 
Now Guyon Hall, what did you all go to Guyon Hall

26:11.248 --> 26:14.211
for? Well that was where all of your other 
activities, that's where you had campus wide

26:14.232 --> 26:27.229
meetings, that's where the president would 
address all of the students, they would have plays

26:14.232 --> 26:27.229
there, they would bring in entertainment, Do you 
remember any important entertainers during your

26:28.559 --> 26:31.222
four years?

26:36.266 --> 26:36.847
Not really. We didn't have those activities, but 
maybe one a year. Let's see, Eisenhower's visit is

26:45.735 --> 26:48.978
not during your years, is it? No, it was a little 
later. No important politics. What about Scona?

26:53.763 --> 26:56.946
Did you all have some notable... speakers they 
were at that point in time notable you recognize

26:57.500 --> 27:23.811
the names as people who were in the military in 
politics or in big business at this time I couldn't

26:57.500 --> 27:23.811
tell you who was there in our freshman through 
senior years

26:57.500 --> 27:23.811
I remember during my early years of being a Skona 
advisor, we had Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee.

27:30.587 --> 27:33.150
Well, he has a relationship with the present day. 
Yes, I don't remember his mentioning a son at all

27:33.171 --> 27:36.215
when he was here. Let's see, did you go to movies in 
Gine Hall? Yes, on Saturdays and probably

27:41.482 --> 27:46.869
Sundays. Were you all shown We've Never Been 
Licked? It showed several times. And what did you

27:53.460 --> 27:55.123
and your buddies think of it? Well, we were 
impressed. It was a good movie.

28:00.249 --> 28:10.102
Academically,

28:00.249 --> 28:10.102
were there any cush courses that people took just 
for grade points, easy courses? Yeah, there were

28:11.103 --> 28:16.190
some that had the reputation of being easy 
courses. What were they?

28:26.448 --> 28:28.571
Did you all talk about Dr. Dan, the grade point man? 
I've heard that phrase. I couldn't even tell you

28:32.237 --> 28:34.761
where he taught. Dan Russell, rural sociology. 
Rural sociology. What courses did athletes take?

28:41.693 --> 28:43.976
Were there supposedly some? I assume that they 
took the same courses we did, but I don't recall

28:44.297 --> 28:48.844
that. All right, and you were here during the Bear 
Bryant years. Right. He was in his second year here

28:53.597 --> 28:59.744
in the fall of 55 when we came. He'd been here one 
year. What impression did Bear Bryant make on you

29:01.146 --> 29:03.789
students? He wasn't very sociable. He had 
breakfast every morning at 6 over there at that

29:10.137 --> 29:15.203
drugstore. At Southgate? At Northgate. Oh, at 
Northgate. Right where Lupo's is now, but there

29:20.959 --> 29:26.368
was a drug store on that corner. And he would come in 
and they would always have a paper and there was one

29:26.388 --> 29:34.543
seat that was, quote, his. Nobody, if you sat 
there, you were asked to move that this is Coach

29:34.923 --> 29:39.992
Bryant's. He would come in, pick up the paper, they 
knew what he wanted, they'd bring his breakfast

29:40.411 --> 29:54.936
over, and he would sit there and drink coffee, and 
you could walk right up to him and say, howdy, and

29:40.411 --> 29:54.936
you didn't exist. He was, as a student, and as I 
remember it, he was very unfriendly. Were you

30:04.222 --> 30:11.269
acquainted with any of the famous members of the 
football team? Who were some of them? Ma Hamilton

30:14.952 --> 30:19.317
served meals, family style. And I don't know if it 
was suggested or recommended that they eat over

30:19.897 --> 30:30.988
there, but Krueger, John David Crowe, Murray 
Trimble, who was one-armed, ate their supper

30:31.897 --> 30:38.206
there. Ma Hamilton was a real small lady. She 
probably was 4'6", 4'7", very spirited. But after

30:51.244 --> 31:01.178
eating, I can remember they would, I don't know 
whether it was their responsibility or they just

30:51.244 --> 31:01.178
enjoyed it or if it was fun for them, but they would 
wash dishes. One of them beat the sink washing

31:02.373 --> 31:06.641
dishes and the cupboard was on the other side of the 
kitchen. And they would throw the glasses and the

31:07.322 --> 31:14.235
plates across the room until Ma came back. So one 
would wash, one would rinse, and one would dry.
