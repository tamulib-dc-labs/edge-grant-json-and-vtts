00:01.060 --> 00:23.744
I notice that

00:01.060 --> 00:23.744
you say in your autobiography, Professor Revell, 
that you grew up close to the sea and always were

00:01.060 --> 00:23.744
attached to and had the mystery of the sea about 
you. Is that your explanation for how you ended up

00:24.225 --> 00:27.809
in oceanography? Not exactly. I was a graduate 
student. I majored in geology at Pomona College.

00:37.424 --> 00:45.575
Afterwards, I spent a year as a teaching assistant 
in the geology department at Pomona. And then I

00:48.098 --> 00:53.646
went to Berkeley as a graduate student in geology 
and a teaching assistant there. And the then

00:53.706 --> 00:57.831
director of the Scripps Institution a man named 
Thomas Whalen Vaughan, came up to Berkeley

00:58.604 --> 01:14.758
looking for a geologist, a graduate student in 
geology, to spend a year at La Jolla looking at some

00:58.604 --> 01:14.758
mud, mud that had been collected from the deep sea 
floor by the non-magnetic yacht Carnegie.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.061
Carnegie had a tragic end. It blew up in the harbor 
of Apia in Samoa.

01:24.686 --> 01:28.189
And the captain and the cabin boy were killed. the 
ship was destroyed. But they had the good sense to

01:30.739 --> 01:38.286
send all their samples off at every port they 
stopped at. And they sent all their bottom

01:39.166 --> 01:47.374
samples, as we used to call them, samples of the 
bottom sediments.

01:47.394 --> 01:49.396
They sent them back to Washington. A man named John 
A. Fleming was then director of the Department of

01:49.476 --> 01:57.383
Terrestrial Magnetism Carnegie Institution, 
which was the operator of this non-magnetic

01:57.852 --> 02:16.274
yacht, asked Braun if he or Pete, if the Scripps 
Institution could examine these, if somebody at

01:57.852 --> 02:16.274
Scripps could examine these sediments and write a 
report on them. And Braun came to Berkeley looking

02:16.394 --> 02:22.061
for somebody to do this. And there were two of us who 
tried for the job, a man named Bill Rand and I.

02:29.240 --> 02:36.595
Interestingly enough, both of us ended up 
involved with the ocean. Bill Rand was the

02:36.615 --> 02:48.379
operator of various kinds of equipment for the oil 
companies, for underwater oil exports.

02:55.075 --> 02:55.856
I got the job. And the reason I applied for the job 
was basically because I was about to get married to

02:55.896 --> 03:11.709
a woman named Ellen Clark, who was a Scripps 
College student and niece of Ellen Browning

02:55.896 --> 03:11.709
Scripps, more or less the patron saint of La Jolla. 
And she had this house right here that her mother

03:11.729 --> 03:15.673
had. It didn't look much like this then, but it was 
in this location, and the central part was there.

03:22.338 --> 03:24.340
We'd come down here in the summertime, if you feel. 
during our courting period, starting in 1927.

03:32.068 --> 03:35.411
And she was just graduating from Scripps, and we 
were just about to get married. And we thought it

03:35.431 --> 03:44.378
would be a good way to spend the first year of our 
married life here in La Jolla, where she was born,

03:35.431 --> 03:44.378
and where she'd spend her summer. So I applied for 
the job and got it. At that time, the Scripps

03:49.423 --> 03:53.506
Institution was a very small place. There were 
only five graduate students.

04:03.115 --> 04:05.077
And I believe there were only five faculty 
members. And the total staff, counting the

04:07.540 --> 04:12.926
students in the faculty, was about 30 people.

04:20.735 --> 04:23.618
And I started looking at these muds and learning 
about how you look at muds.

04:28.744 --> 04:32.768
Two of the other graduate students were a man named 
Richard Fleming, Richard Howell Fleming. who

04:34.064 --> 04:45.655
spent the last 25 years, I guess, thereabouts at 
the Oceanographic Laboratories of the

04:34.064 --> 04:45.655
University of Washington. There was a man named 
Maynard Harding. I don't really know what became

04:48.017 --> 04:49.539
of him. They were both chemists. And one 
afternoon, Dick Fleming came into my lab, the lab I

04:55.505 --> 05:01.270
was sitting in, and said, Well, you're the new boy 
here, and we're supposed to go to sea tomorrow and

05:02.093 --> 05:18.209
take an oceanographic station.

05:18.229 --> 05:24.194
And I said, OK. We got up about 2 o'clock in the 
morning. We were all living out there at the

05:24.214 --> 05:27.958
Scripps Institution. We had this group of little 
cottages around the laboratory building, which

05:32.688 --> 05:36.133
had been built in 1960. Dick Fleming lived in one of 
these, and Ellen and I lived in another. He wasn't

05:39.878 --> 05:40.780
married then.

05:44.966 --> 05:47.269
They came and picked me up about 2, 2.30 in the 
morning. We drove down to San Diego to Point Loma,

05:47.289 --> 05:54.580
where the Scripps Institution ship was tied up. 
The ship was an ex-purse singer called the

05:55.842 --> 06:00.889
Scripps, about 65 feet long. It had one 
professional crew member, a guy named Murdoch

06:02.371 --> 06:11.139
Ross, a Scottish railroad engineer. And he'd come 
down to San Diego from British Columbia. I always

06:17.845 --> 06:22.930
used to say his idea of keeping a ship in good shape 
is to keep it covered with grease like a

06:17.845 --> 06:22.930
locomotive.

06:25.913 --> 06:26.814
That wasn't quite true. But he was primarily a 
railroad engineer, not in any way But he ran the

06:32.088 --> 06:35.812
engine. And then we three were the crew, Harding 
and Fleming and I. We started out about 3.30 in the

06:41.637 --> 06:51.627
morning and went off Point Loma about 15 miles to a 
deep area which is known as the San Diego Craw.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.273
And we started to take a station. Scripps had a 
program. started by one of the faculty members

07:01.214 --> 07:23.217
named Eric Moberg, the chemist, to make weekly 
observations of the nutrients in the water, the

07:01.214 --> 07:23.217
phosphate and the silica and the nitrate, and the 
oxygen content of the water, and the temperature

07:01.214 --> 07:23.217
and salinity of the water, and to collect plankton 
samples. And we did this by stopping in one place

07:23.377 --> 07:29.584
and taking a series of vertical samples at 
different depths. This one sample of each of about

07:31.285 --> 07:35.332
15 depths. This used to be called, probably still 
is called, an oceanographic station.

07:42.865 --> 07:51.961
Along about 11 o'clock in the morning, the other 
guy said, well, you're the new boy, so it's your job

07:42.865 --> 07:51.961
to cook dinner. So I went down to the galley, and I 
Scripps has always had a policy of feeding very

07:55.990 --> 07:58.953
well. We had steak and boiled potatoes and lettuce 
and tomato salad. It was a very good, simple lunch.

08:09.104 --> 08:18.053
And the other guys came down and ate this dinner in 
absolute silence, not saying a word. Neither good

08:18.073 --> 08:19.494
nor bad, they just ate it. That's the way sailors 
are. They hardly ever say much when they're

08:21.516 --> 08:23.078
eating. And after about 10 minutes, after they'd 
finished wolfing it down, they got up and said,

08:24.357 --> 08:31.988
well, it makes us seasick down here. We better go up 
topside again. You better do the dishes. I didn't

08:36.675 --> 08:37.596
get seasick. Well, I stayed and did the dishes and 
cleaned up. Went back up and we finished the

08:42.523 --> 08:46.709
station. And we came in back to San Diego. And I 
remember we got back just about dusk. Must have

08:53.534 --> 08:57.838
been about 7, 38 o'clock in the evening. And this 
was an absolutely marvelous experience. I'd

09:00.401 --> 09:03.424
never really been on a ship before in my life. I'd 
gone down to the beach in the summertime. We lived

09:05.986 --> 09:08.549
in Pasadena, and I was a little boy. We lived in 
Redondo Beach. And we'd go down to Balboa in the

09:11.151 --> 09:16.857
summertime. I'd really never been on a ship 
before, except the old Congress that was there.

09:24.196 --> 09:29.884
pastor's team had sailed up and down the West 
Coast. This was such a wonderful experience that I

09:29.904 --> 09:43.623
decided right then and there I wanted to be an 
oceanographer, because you have this marvelous

09:29.904 --> 09:43.623
business of doing science and being a sailor at the 
same time. So after that, we went out quite

09:43.643 --> 09:47.689
regularly on the Scripps.

09:49.913 --> 09:51.135
was an old purse sinker. That's an old fishing 
boat. A fishing boat was used off this coast, a

09:52.937 --> 10:02.972
special kind of a net called a purse

09:52.937 --> 10:02.972
sinker. And we never went very far. But we used to 
organize cruises to sail in the Southern

10:06.377 --> 10:17.794
California waters about 100 miles offshore and 
about 150 miles north of here and a little ways to

10:06.377 --> 10:17.794
the south. of studying the ocean,

10:19.141 --> 10:30.611
essentially the water, the water conditions off 
the California coast. After a couple of years,

10:32.713 --> 10:47.646
this is 1931, about 1933

10:32.713 --> 10:47.646
or 1934, I didn't see so much that I actually became 
the skipper of this little vessel. a small boat

10:48.014 --> 10:53.220
operator's license up at San Pedro.

10:55.823 --> 10:56.764
So I was in charge. By that time, we had a cook as well 
as an engineer. And I was the assistant engineer at

11:01.929 --> 11:06.214
first. I used to, when we were on these cruises that 
lasted a week or more, I would spell the engineer,

11:06.234 --> 11:15.585
where he brought,

11:06.234 --> 11:15.585
in the engine room. And later, we had this cook. 
Frank, I've forgotten his last

11:18.271 --> 11:24.081
name.

11:26.945 --> 11:29.089
And I used to insist that we keep the ship clean. And 
I bossed the other graduate students around. And

11:33.356 --> 11:35.139
there's research assistants around. Some were 
not actually graduate students. But they didn't

11:37.963 --> 11:39.185
like it very well. I was

11:39.225 --> 11:45.055
fairly naughty. very much like a skipper should 
be, I guess. But anyhow, we all got along. And

11:54.369 --> 12:16.088
we went on several of these small cruises lasting a 
week to two weeks, coming into port in San Clemente

11:54.369 --> 12:16.088
Island and Santa Monica, Santa Cruz Island, San 
Nicolas, and Santa Rosa.

12:19.510 --> 12:22.614
Santa Barbara Island. This is really in Catalina, 
too. We used to anchor at the Iskansaw Catalina.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.762
These were marvelous things to do. And finally, 
1936, after five years of this, I finally got

12:29.902 --> 12:40.494
through looking at this goddamn mud and got my 
doctor's degree at Berkeley. The Scripps

12:40.514 --> 12:45.940
Institution was then part of the Graduate School 
at Berkeley, the outlying field station.

12:48.907 --> 12:57.118
In the meantime, I've done quite a bit of work with 
Moberg and Fleming on the chemistry of seawater,

12:48.907 --> 12:57.118
particularly. Fleming and I did some work on the 
solubility of calcium carbonate in seawater, one

12:58.239 --> 13:07.411
of the earliest papers published on that. And 
Moberg and Greenberg, Revell and Allen published

13:07.431 --> 13:17.344
a paper on the buffer mechanism of seawater. I was, 
I was, my contribution to this was to show that

13:18.860 --> 13:28.674
boric acid is part of the buffer system of sea 
water. It's not only calcium, carbonate, the

13:28.694 --> 13:45.559
carbonates and bicarbonates and the cations like 
calcium and sodium, but also there's some effect

13:28.694 --> 13:45.559
of boric acid and that changes the the 
relationship between pH and the amount of

13:46.720 --> 13:50.724
carbonate in the water. And about 1933, Dr. 
Vaughan went on a year's sabbatical. He was

13:58.213 --> 14:06.181
chairman of a committee of the National Academy of 
Sciences to look at oceanographic institutions

13:58.213 --> 14:06.181
all over the world. And I was really lagging way 
behind looking at this mud. I was doing all these

14:12.849 --> 14:16.052
other things on ocean chemistry.

14:18.698 --> 14:28.670
And he wrote a letter back to Dr. Moberg, who was 
acting director of Scritch, saying, we've just

14:18.698 --> 14:28.670
got to get this fellow Revell back on the job of 
looking at this mud. Otherwise, maybe we'll have

14:28.710 --> 14:30.112
to fire him. And this was right in the middle of the 
Depression, 31 to 36.

14:38.542 --> 14:45.550
And then Moberg was very much against that, 
because he thought I was doing OK, even though I was

14:38.542 --> 14:45.550
looking at the mud.

14:48.010 --> 15:04.367
I was doing OK.

14:48.010 --> 15:04.367
And at

14:48.010 --> 15:04.367
one time during this period, the University of 
California was very short of money. And they were

15:06.869 --> 15:10.853
thinking that they would have to fire all the 
research assistants down here. Because I

15:11.634 --> 15:15.638
remember the faculty actually took a cut in their 
own salaries. So they could

15:16.310 --> 15:33.828
keep on.

15:33.848 --> 15:45.000
In order to keep the research assistants on, I 
believe the faculty actually took a voluntary

15:33.848 --> 15:45.000
reduction salary. Another couple, and Ellen and 
I, were trying to prepare ourselves in case we did

15:47.140 --> 15:56.855
get laid off. Her mother had a lemon grove up near 
Riverside, and we went up to look at that and see if

15:57.636 --> 16:08.052
we could live there and farm that, or grow lemons in 
that lemon grove. It was not a very promising

16:08.072 --> 16:09.715
prospect. Anyhow, they didn't lay us off, so we 
stayed on.

16:17.110 --> 16:25.622
I finally got my thesis written on the marine 
bottom samples collected by the yacht Carnegie. I

16:25.642 --> 16:33.994
got my PhD in the spring of 1936 at Berkeley.

16:35.436 --> 16:41.786
That was when the Scripps Institution was part of 
the graduate division of the University of

16:35.436 --> 16:41.786
California at Berkeley. UCLA didn't have a 
graduate division just when they graduated.

16:48.616 --> 16:59.459
And it was clear that I was quite determined to stay 
on, so they promoted me to instructor.

17:05.392 --> 17:09.240
My salary went from $1,200 a year to $1,800.

17:14.705 --> 17:16.407
And I was an instructor. I continued being an 
instructor until the war came along, and I went on

17:16.487 --> 17:25.139
active duty in the Navy. That's in 1941, though. 
Between 36 and 41, what sort of projects did you

17:29.385 --> 17:33.190
work on at Scripps?

17:36.114 --> 17:40.240
Well, the first year, after from 36 to 37, And our 
whole family went to Norway, where I had what would

17:41.570 --> 17:57.768
now be called a post-doctoral

17:41.570 --> 17:57.768
fellowship, although we paid for it, at the 
Geophysical Institute in Bergen.

18:04.496 --> 18:10.783
And the man, Dr. Vaughan, retired in 1936, the 
summer that I by my PhD. His place was taken by

18:13.343 --> 18:26.261
Harold Sperger, who was a great Norwegian 
oceanographer, probably the best oceanographer

18:13.343 --> 18:26.261
of his time in physical oceanography. The 
Norwegians were leaders in physical

18:27.263 --> 18:40.602
oceanography for about 50 years, about 40 years, I 
think, because of the influence of a man named

18:27.263 --> 18:40.602
Willem Bjerknes. who was a theoretical 
physicist, who especially was hydrodynamics.

18:49.479 --> 19:01.171
And he invented,

18:49.479 --> 19:01.171
well, he really applied hydrodynamics to 
planetary circulation, to both the ocean and the

18:49.479 --> 19:01.171
atmosphere.

19:01.191 --> 19:04.674
And there was a whole group of Scandinavians at 
that time. Alfred Ekman was the better of the

19:09.674 --> 19:22.314
so-called Ekman spiral, which is the theoretical 
way that a wind-driven current turns to the right

19:09.674 --> 19:22.314
of the northern hemisphere as you go deeper in a 
spiral. And Bjorn Helen Hansen, who was

19:24.257 --> 19:37.437
essentially a descriptive physical 
oceanographer, he was particularly concerned

19:24.257 --> 19:37.437
with the accuracy and variability of 
observations He'd been a colleague of Fridtjof

19:38.193 --> 20:02.614
Nansen, the explorer and world citizen, who had 
invented something called the Nansen bottle,

19:38.193 --> 20:02.614
which is a bottle for sampling the water at 
different depths, an ingenious device for

19:38.193 --> 20:02.614
closing the bottle by the weight that you dropped 
on the cable when you wanted to close it. Helen

20:03.691 --> 20:12.982
Hansen used these Nansen bottles and reversing 
thermometers to make very accurate measurements

20:03.691 --> 20:12.982
of temperature. And the water samples that they 
collected, they could make very accurate

20:14.344 --> 20:18.449
measurements of salinity. And from these, it was 
possible to compute the densities, the surfaces

20:20.070 --> 20:31.504
of equal density in the ocean and the surfaces of 
equal pressure or pressure differential.

20:34.235 --> 20:58.386
And

20:34.235 --> 20:58.386
those people in Scandinavia, particularly 
Bjerkes and his followers, developed the theory

20:34.235 --> 20:58.386
of

20:34.235 --> 20:58.386
pressure-driven circulation in the ocean, in 
which the pressure gradient was balanced against

20:34.235 --> 20:58.386
Coriolis force, not really a force,

21:04.238 --> 21:14.695
Because of the Earth's rotation, the currents 
turn it parallel to the pressure gradient instead

21:04.238 --> 21:14.695
of right angles to it, or nearly parallel. The real 
balancing force, of course, is the force of

21:14.956 --> 21:18.261
friction. But the only way you can get that to 
balance is to have the current running very close

21:19.283 --> 21:31.022
to parallel to the surface of equal pressure, 
running along the hill instead of down the hill.

21:34.208 --> 21:43.623
And this theory of pressure-driven currents was 
an equilibrium theory. It didn't allow for what we

21:43.683 --> 21:49.211
call convergence or divergence.

21:51.415 --> 21:58.306
You had to have continuity at every plane, every 
horizontal plane. Whereas what actually happens

21:58.326 --> 22:01.110
is that in some places the water converges and 
sinks or rises. In other places, they have

22:04.680 --> 22:07.324
divergence. Actually, if you have convergence, 
the water sinks. If you have divergence, the water

22:09.507 --> 22:12.933
rises and spreads out. And that's this theory that 
didn't account for that. Equine's theory, on the

22:18.181 --> 22:29.258
other hand, was based upon stress,

22:18.181 --> 22:29.258
but likewise based on the balance between 
Coriolis force and the stress of the wind.

22:29.862 --> 22:34.507
friction, the friction of the wind on the sea 
surface. And again, that's a second order.

22:39.473 --> 22:57.733
Essentially, as a second order effect,

22:39.473 --> 22:57.733
the viscous friction in the water, so-called 
turbulent friction.

22:57.873 --> 22:59.295
And there was a man named

23:02.515 --> 23:08.443
Otto Pettersson in Sweden, who'd done a good deal 
of oceanographic observation.

23:12.288 --> 23:20.698
Great Dane, who worked out, a man named Martin 
Knudsen, who worked out the methods of measuring

23:12.288 --> 23:20.698
salinity very accurately. And the tables, the 
so-called Knudsen's tables, that enable you to

23:23.142 --> 23:29.670
translate temperature and salinity into 
density.

23:32.435 --> 23:34.017
Eklund was involved with that, too. And at the same 
time, there were a lot of great meteorologists

23:34.038 --> 23:39.626
there. Bergen, Jock Bjerknes, Willem Bjerknes' 
son, and his name's Farah Pettersson. Carl Gustav

23:49.342 --> 23:56.653
Rosby was a Swede who'd come to the United States, 
but he was really part of the Scandinavian school.

24:00.835 --> 24:02.818
Although he spent quite a bit of time at MIT.

24:05.301 --> 24:29.172
So during the early part of this century and up 
until after World War II, the principle,

24:05.301 --> 24:29.172
the leaders in this kind of physical 
oceanography, the study of the currents, or what

24:05.301 --> 24:29.172
used to call the motions of the oceans, were all 
Scandinavians, mostly Norwegians, but some

24:29.725 --> 24:35.172
Swedes, some Danes, and some Germans. And there 
was also a great Austrian named Albert Defant,

24:35.232 --> 24:46.808
D-F-A-N-T.

24:35.232 --> 24:46.808
A German named Meritz, and another one named 
Buist. Buist was primarily a descriptive

24:47.068 --> 24:49.151
oceanographer.

24:51.775 --> 24:59.445
All these people attended a meeting of the 
International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics in

24:51.775 --> 24:59.445
Edinburgh. in 1936.

25:03.727 --> 25:05.570
And I met them for the first time there. Except for 
Sferter. Sferter would come out here with his wife

25:08.934 --> 25:11.917
and child and daughter. And I met him out here just 
briefly before we left.

25:20.248 --> 25:23.993
And it turned out, actually, that I would have done 
better just to stay here and work with him. But we

25:25.354 --> 25:29.179
had, in terms of research and learning,

25:31.606 --> 25:36.293
We had a wonderful time in Norway, and the first 
time either of us had ever been outside the United

25:31.606 --> 25:36.293
States. We had our two small daughters with us. One 
of them was about four years old, and one was about

25:42.722 --> 25:49.632
three and a half, and one was about six months. Then 
we went there, and of course, a year later when we

25:49.652 --> 25:57.563
came back, our oldest daughter got so she talked 
English with a strong Norwegian accent

26:01.880 --> 26:05.263
Our youngest daughter was quite ill, had 
diarrhea. And

26:06.745 --> 26:12.370
she just got thinner and thinner and punier and 
punier. And I remember one night, we

26:12.430 --> 26:20.538
were very worried about her. And I got on the 
streetcar. We lived in a place called Hope, just

26:23.060 --> 26:30.587
outside of Bergen, next to another little suburb 
called Paradise. I got in the street car and went

26:31.495 --> 26:37.122
into town, and I see a woman doctor named Johanna 
Scram Anderson. I was scared to death that Mary was

26:38.263 --> 26:40.346
really sick.

26:44.912 --> 26:54.263
And she gave me some fruit juice called Saft, and 
she said, give the child some of this several times

26:44.912 --> 26:54.263
a day. We did, and she got well

26:55.685 --> 27:01.232
before the days of antibiotics. or even sulfur 
drugs, I guess. I'm not quite sure about that.

27:07.795 --> 27:16.547
One of the people that we became very good friends 
with was one of the couples we became very good

27:07.795 --> 27:16.547
friends with were Jaak and Hedvig Bjerknes. Jaak 
Bjerknes was the inventor of the theory of air mass

27:16.567 --> 27:21.574
analysis. During World War I, he had the job of 
running what they called the Baerbarsling and

27:22.716 --> 27:31.067
Baubest line of weather forecasting for Western 
Norway. Of course, there weren't any ship, very

27:31.891 --> 27:40.724
few ship reports, because the radios were all 
silent. And he had somehow to make forecasts for

27:40.744 --> 27:43.909
the fishing vessels. And he developed this theory 
of the polar, of the air mass front, fronts between

27:45.471 --> 27:51.900
air masses. Air mass is a different physical 
characteristic. One air mass is a slightly cold

27:57.308 --> 28:00.733
front in which the cold air slid under the warm air 
in the warm front which the warm air slid up over the

28:01.557 --> 28:28.543
cold air and i learned something quite 
fundamental from him that was that you must leave a

28:01.557 --> 28:28.543
good scientist really lets nature take the lead 
that is that he would he would never try to force the

28:01.557 --> 28:28.543
weapon never try to have a to have a theory about it 
or have a predilection about it. He'd just lie back

28:34.042 --> 28:37.889
and let nature tell him what was going to happen. 
And this was remarkable. It said to rain 32 days out

28:40.734 --> 28:44.702
of every month in Bergen. It does rain. It does rain 
every day.
