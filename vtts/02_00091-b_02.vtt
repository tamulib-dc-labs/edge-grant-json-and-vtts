WEBVTT

00:02.343 --> 00:04.390
The answer to that question is yes.

00:05.474 --> 00:06.638
Are we recording now?

00:06.879 --> 00:08.425
Well, the answer to that question is yes.

00:09.970 --> 00:13.382
Gus, Gus, Gus, that's too much.

00:13.733 --> 00:17.578
Let's see Gus, I've got to be able to see my notes.

00:19.340 --> 00:21.763
There you go.

00:21.783 --> 00:31.895
Asking for excuses, until one thing, until it got to the point that I personally made the decision we would give no one an excuse.

00:31.935 --> 00:36.501
This was in a flu epidemic.

00:36.481 --> 00:43.015
other people's time was being consumed with writing excuses for people.

00:43.637 --> 00:48.107
And I thought, you know, these people are too busy to be writing these excuses.

00:48.147 --> 00:49.570
There will be no excuses.

00:49.610 --> 00:53.258
No one under any circumstances will get one.

00:53.238 --> 01:05.469
And I don't know how I remember it got that out to the faculty, to instructors and so forth, but the word got around.

01:06.670 --> 01:10.393
And then they, after that, they didn't ask anymore.

01:11.635 --> 01:23.245
As the student body grew, the number of patients increased, but also as it became more diverse, male and female, and in nationality, national background,

01:23.579 --> 01:27.984
How did that affect the health center?

01:30.487 --> 01:35.212
Female, of course, we had a clinic, a GYN clinic.

01:37.635 --> 01:43.161
So we had a special clinic for female medical problems once a week.

01:44.522 --> 01:52.371
I can't honestly remember any problems with international students.

01:54.815 --> 02:00.867
Well they were always very picky about themselves, very- You said picky?

02:01.148 --> 02:01.629
Picky.

02:03.071 --> 02:05.616
Like for instance I have a rash here.

02:06.238 --> 02:10.967
See that right there?

02:10.947 --> 02:15.333
Can't see a rash, you know.

02:15.353 --> 02:15.794
I don't know.

02:15.934 --> 02:22.323
I remember that in East Indians more than any other group.

02:22.623 --> 02:25.006
Otherwise, no particular problems.

02:25.507 --> 02:32.837
Any problems about their religious background causing them not to accept certain medicines or treatments?

02:32.817 --> 02:33.219
None.

02:34.002 --> 02:35.972
Not a single one that I can remember.

02:36.032 --> 02:39.187
No Jehovah's Witnesses or anything like that.

02:40.312 --> 02:41.899
Nor, well,

02:43.685 --> 02:52.696
I think we may have administered some blood, but for the most part, if a student needed blood administered, we transferred them over to St.

02:52.716 --> 02:54.498
Joseph or the home.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.461
They always had the option of going home.

02:57.702 --> 03:00.425
They didn't have to do what we suggested.

03:00.445 --> 03:02.888
They just, we just suggested they have further treatment.

03:03.409 --> 03:09.276
Most of them stayed right here, and they wanted to get back to the health center as soon as they could.

03:09.597 --> 03:12.460
How often did you run into something that was drug related?

03:15.123 --> 03:17.367
Very, very seldom.

03:19.069 --> 03:23.336
At least that we had sense enough to know what was in fact drug related.

03:23.376 --> 03:33.412
One boy ate some mushrooms one day, was picking mushrooms, and these are particular kind of mushrooms that they eat.

03:33.732 --> 03:35.195
I didn't realize it until then.

03:35.555 --> 03:38.620
They grow up through cow patties in the pasture.

03:39.381 --> 03:42.987
So I had noticed before that

03:42.967 --> 03:49.718
student-age people stooping over in pastures doing something.

03:49.879 --> 03:51.081
I didn't know what they were doing.

03:51.902 --> 03:56.550
Then this guy comes in and he had been picking mushrooms that grew out of the cow patties.

03:59.535 --> 04:01.117
He was delirious.

04:01.158 --> 04:07.388
He was manageable easily.

04:07.368 --> 04:10.292
He was delusional.

04:11.394 --> 04:30.263
He was looking at the centerfold of Playboy, and it came alive, which of course was, I mean, what better thing could you hope for than that Playboy centerfold is alive and right there.

04:30.323 --> 04:33.628
He had made a sandwich out of them.

04:34.317 --> 04:44.674
And he put a bunch of them on a sandwich and for some strange reason had decided to flick a few of them off before he ate it.

04:44.694 --> 04:49.823
And then went ahead and ate the sandwich and sure enough had these delusions.

04:51.366 --> 04:52.588
And how did you treat that?

04:53.209 --> 04:53.990
Time.

04:55.813 --> 04:58.738
Put him to bed and give him a little time.

04:58.718 --> 05:01.104
We knew what that one was all about.

05:02.207 --> 05:12.272
Drugs nowadays I think probably would be harder to either detect or to, well, we would be more conscious of them.

05:13.147 --> 05:18.576
Do you remember any situations where you all couldn't figure out what the problem was?

05:20.619 --> 05:20.780
Yeah.

05:23.684 --> 05:24.746
There were problems.

05:26.849 --> 05:28.612
We had some meningitis.

05:30.255 --> 05:31.237
We didn't know what kind.

05:31.277 --> 05:39.390
We didn't have facilities to do cultures on spinal fluid.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.246
Some infectious mono.

05:42.326 --> 05:44.310
Infectious mono is sort of a great mimicker.

05:44.330 --> 05:52.027
It can do lots and lots of things, including pneumonia, and that's exactly what we had to put up with was pneumonia.

05:53.390 --> 05:58.240
You might know that that would happen in the Student Health Center.

06:01.240 --> 06:08.009
Can't think of any other things that we had serious problems with.

06:09.551 --> 06:13.837
A lot of infectious diseases, of course.

06:16.401 --> 06:20.486
Measles, mumps, chicken pox.

06:22.669 --> 06:24.852
Which of those was the most difficult to cope with?

06:27.346 --> 06:34.354
Probably, although it probably represented fewer of the cases than measles, was mumps.

06:35.595 --> 06:41.161
Because we had mumps with orchitis, we had it with meningitis, we had one with a pneumonia.

06:41.181 --> 06:53.235
Of course there's no treatment, it's just supportive care.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.277
Both boys and girls, men and women?

06:56.978 --> 06:59.446
Yeah, yeah, both.

07:00.550 --> 07:05.166
And we never had any- Not a lot of these now, but these are memories that I have.

07:05.281 --> 07:11.450
And no big outbreak of any food, dining hall food caused?

07:11.470 --> 07:12.351
No, no.

07:12.551 --> 07:16.917
A lot, of course, that was, that people wanted to blame on Cebiza.

07:18.279 --> 07:23.326
But I felt that Cebiza, that there was never a problem there.

07:26.010 --> 07:33.220
In terms of... I thought that the problems would be much bigger than they actually were if it were something like Cebiza.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.782
And I just didn't believe it.

07:35.116 --> 07:45.969
In your years of experience, did you ever really feel that y'all got many patients where the problem had originated in either campus dining hall?

07:49.573 --> 07:52.096
That the clean- You mean like isolated cases even?

07:52.296 --> 07:53.878
Yeah, were there- Not epidemics.

07:53.898 --> 07:56.461
That the cause of the problem was a lack of cleanliness?

07:56.481 --> 07:57.382
Oh, absolutely not.

07:57.442 --> 07:58.023
That's what I thought.

07:58.464 --> 07:58.524
No.

07:58.544 --> 07:58.664
No.

07:59.385 --> 07:59.685
Never.

08:01.207 --> 08:03.790
Never any question that came up that I remember.

08:05.255 --> 08:21.103
Did you ever get from any higher authority campus or board or politician or any former student any special directive to do something or not to do something?

08:23.598 --> 08:25.581
Not, no, no.

08:25.781 --> 08:26.462
You never had to?

08:26.863 --> 08:27.904
People left us alone.

08:29.867 --> 08:40.922
I think they sort of assumed that we knew what our job was and knew reasonably well how to do it and weren't really going to take any orders from anybody else.

08:41.022 --> 08:48.693
And I know that sounds... No board member ever came over and tried to tell you how to run the health center or anything?

08:48.833 --> 08:51.157
One board member came over one night, I remember.

08:51.177 --> 08:53.520
I happened to be there.

08:54.715 --> 08:58.498
And he wanted treatment, and I treated him.

08:58.799 --> 09:10.449
But I let him know in not uncertain terms, but not very pleasantly.

09:11.169 --> 09:23.440
He probably didn't even know what I was telling him, that we didn't normally treat the board, that we were a student health center, and here for the students, and so forth.

09:23.420 --> 09:27.846
And to my knowledge, that's the last time I ever treated anybody for the board.

09:28.147 --> 09:35.257
But I heard absolutely, I expected, I was ready for any eventuality after that, but I never got anything.

09:36.098 --> 09:42.587
Once the medical school here began, did that have any effect on the Student Health Center?

09:44.089 --> 09:49.697
Jim Knight was...

09:51.179 --> 09:52.101
President.

09:52.121 --> 09:52.382
Dean.

09:52.602 --> 09:54.246
Dean of the medical school.

09:55.289 --> 09:58.156
And I wanted to have a close relationship with him.

09:59.058 --> 10:03.028
With him, and I did with him, and with the medical school.

10:04.170 --> 10:05.273
I wanted to teach

10:06.772 --> 10:17.066
And I felt that I could and so when they got set up they asked me to teach physical diagnosis.

10:17.527 --> 10:32.468
Now physical diagnosis is simply by way of physical exam, beginning at least or finishing, making a diagnosis of a physical illness on the basis of a physical finding.

10:32.508 --> 10:36.694
What you see, what you hear, what you feel, so forth.

10:36.674 --> 10:39.318
And I was teaching that.

10:39.899 --> 10:45.767
And I would teach, I would have four or five students, oh every other afternoon or so.

10:46.708 --> 10:56.723
And because I didn't, obviously didn't have a great deal of time, and we would meet at the health center where we had teaching material so to speak.

10:57.744 --> 11:03.272
And I enjoyed it thoroughly and I thought it was a good idea.

11:04.518 --> 11:12.705
Physical diagnosis has since sort of become less important.

11:14.027 --> 11:14.907
It's old-fashioned.

11:16.469 --> 11:20.692
It's too easy to order an x-ray than to listen to a chest, you know?

11:20.712 --> 11:32.483
It's too easy to order an MRI than to fill someone's abdomen or look for a gallstone or something like that.

11:32.463 --> 11:33.986
That's the situation now.

11:34.667 --> 11:41.901
What happened in medical school, I honestly don't know, but Jim was not there for long.

11:42.462 --> 11:54.606
And not long after he left there began to be less and less said and done about my physical diagnosis class.

11:54.586 --> 11:56.189
I don't think it was me.

11:59.795 --> 12:09.673
I was just doing what I was taught, which is what my profs were taught at Johns Hopkins, which is where they came from.

12:09.713 --> 12:12.999
So I really think everything was okay.

12:13.680 --> 12:18.028
I think they probably felt that it got old fashioned.

12:18.008 --> 12:27.756
Did the medical school ever raise the question about using the Student Health Center as a clinic where some of their students might observe?

12:27.776 --> 12:34.802
I offered many times, many times, but they never, never really did anything about it.

12:35.503 --> 12:42.268
What was the relationship with the Health Center and your relationship with the local medical community otherwise?

12:46.892 --> 12:47.112
St.

12:47.132 --> 12:47.813
Joe's and

12:48.569 --> 12:50.973
Our interrelationships.

12:52.335 --> 12:59.045
Well, of course, I had a good relationship with the medical society.

13:01.229 --> 13:10.223
Well, not so much the medical staff at the medical school.

13:10.203 --> 13:12.348
Because I didn't necessarily know them all.

13:12.529 --> 13:15.315
I never really got into that group.

13:15.335 --> 13:22.834
I knew Joyce Davis and I knew Jack, oh the one that got in trouble out there.

13:23.896 --> 13:28.347
He invented something and he sued them for some reason.

13:30.183 --> 13:31.485
I think they discharged him.

13:31.525 --> 13:31.985
I don't know.

13:32.746 --> 13:33.827
I forget his last name.

13:34.068 --> 13:35.209
But anyway, it's just as well.

13:37.532 --> 13:42.138
But among the first ones to come on the staff, I knew them.

13:44.621 --> 13:45.682
Right then, at St.

13:45.702 --> 13:47.584
Joseph's, what about the relationship?

13:47.624 --> 13:47.684
St.

13:48.005 --> 13:48.585
Joseph's?

13:48.645 --> 13:50.328
I was never actually on the staff.

13:50.388 --> 13:51.309
No, no.

13:51.829 --> 13:57.016
I was meaning that the working relationship between the Student Health Center and St.

13:57.036 --> 13:57.416
Joseph.

13:57.777 --> 13:58.958
Oh, it was excellent.

13:58.938 --> 14:01.241
Yeah, yeah.

14:02.063 --> 14:03.625
I never heard any complaints.

14:05.147 --> 14:09.474
Were you pleased with the kind of service which you think St.

14:09.494 --> 14:12.158
Joseph provided to patients from the campus?

14:12.178 --> 14:13.680
Yes, mm-hmm, yes.

14:15.683 --> 14:15.883
Yeah.

14:17.450 --> 14:29.524
I presume, well, it may not be a completely fair presumption, but I presume that they, as many times as I have been an inpatient myself at St.

14:29.544 --> 14:37.072
Joseph, that they gave our students the same kind of care that they gave me, and it was good.

14:37.092 --> 14:40.656
I was very well pleased with it.

14:40.636 --> 14:49.893
A few times I talked with the administrator over there and I forget what his name is.

14:49.913 --> 14:54.882
He's not the administrator now.

14:56.836 --> 15:12.614
specifically talking about, not talking about how specific students were treated, but specifically talking about what I would like to, kind of treatment I would like for students to have and that sort of thing.

15:12.654 --> 15:20.583
In other words, nothing special, but at the same time, best service they had to give.

15:20.924 --> 15:26.370
How capable, during your years of activity,

15:26.823 --> 15:39.246
How capable was the local medical community to meet our needs?

15:40.711 --> 15:41.793
Pretty well, pretty well.

15:43.016 --> 15:58.045
It wasn't often that we had to, say, take someone or send someone out of town who went home who wouldn't have otherwise for illnesses that we couldn't handle.

15:59.493 --> 16:02.718
Of course, obviously, major surgical problems.

16:03.920 --> 16:06.284
We had, incidentally, consultants.

16:06.304 --> 16:07.927
We had an orthopedic consultant.

16:07.947 --> 16:15.119
We had a urology consultant whom we talked into coming out to the health center once a week to operate a clinic.

16:15.480 --> 16:21.450
Orthopedics, urology, surgery.

16:25.362 --> 16:26.424
Those were the main ones.

16:27.767 --> 16:38.190
And are you like I that stand in almost awe about how much greater

16:39.503 --> 16:45.275
the medical capability is here now than it was 20 years ago plus.

16:45.816 --> 16:46.357
Absolutely.

16:46.417 --> 16:53.932
Capability, diagnostic equipment, it's different between night and day.

16:55.796 --> 16:57.018
I was asking about high points.

16:57.058 --> 17:00.465
What are some low points, some frustrations, disappointments?

17:01.103 --> 17:06.517
Well of course staff problems that I had to deal with constantly.

17:09.184 --> 17:14.016
They bothered me and they bothered me almost

17:15.751 --> 17:29.494
in a way, not that I had to do the work or that someone else may have had to do the work, but that these are people to be pitied almost rather than criticized, you know.

17:30.476 --> 17:35.684
And unfortunately I couldn't really work up a great deal of pity.

17:36.967 --> 17:40.813
But anyway, other low points.

17:42.683 --> 18:01.300
Of course, when I retired, I even talked to John one night, and he and Meridell were over here, and I was doing very, very well after my surgery, and I told him,

18:03.490 --> 18:16.367
I sort of made an assumption that he would want me back, you know, and I told him that I would love to come back perhaps doing less, perhaps just working in the treatment room or something like that.

18:16.808 --> 18:19.732
He said, no, I don't think that would be too good an idea right now.

18:20.854 --> 18:25.600
And I think it was because

18:27.554 --> 18:35.746
The very day that I had my tachycardia, remember when I told you I fainted?

18:35.766 --> 18:52.752
That very day there was some talk on campus in John's office, I suppose, and some woman whose name I don't remember married somebody.

18:54.875 --> 18:58.822
to the effect that I was not doing a good job at the health center.

19:00.726 --> 19:01.447
That very day.

19:01.788 --> 19:12.687
As a matter of fact, that's what made me, I was under such tension that day, that's what made me faint and what made this thing happen.

19:14.170 --> 19:15.853
But anyway,

19:15.833 --> 19:20.120
I mentioned it to John that I would be glad to come back.

19:20.660 --> 19:26.970
And he said, I don't think that would be tactful the way John always is.

19:26.990 --> 19:29.474
I don't think that would be too good an idea right now.

19:29.534 --> 19:30.716
No, just let it go with that.

19:31.317 --> 19:35.223
And then I sort of began to piece things together.

19:35.583 --> 19:41.993
But I think a low point in that respect was not so much that I

19:41.973 --> 19:51.510
understood that I would not be going back to work at the health center, but rather that they started making such drastic changes to the health center

19:52.975 --> 20:05.331
I was hardly, you know, a comparable example, cold in my grave before they put on new front doors.

20:05.932 --> 20:07.414
Now that shouldn't bother you.

20:07.434 --> 20:13.221
That's something I campaigned for for 15 years and nobody paid any attention to me.

20:13.762 --> 20:16.165
That they took the kitchen, that was dear to my heart.

20:16.666 --> 20:21.312
That they took the inpatient service, that was dearer still.

20:24.329 --> 20:37.541
made quite a few changes to the point that now, unless I don't know if I specifically said it, I have absolutely nothing in common with the health center, the people out there.

20:37.801 --> 20:39.084
I don't even know the people.

20:39.144 --> 20:42.793
Most of the people I worked with have retired themselves.

20:42.773 --> 20:50.463
And, of course, I claim I wouldn't have a place to park anyway if I went out there.

20:51.925 --> 20:54.909
And I have no business out there to do.

20:55.069 --> 21:10.570
So the only time I had been back to the health center was when Patsy Luce, the dear sweet thing, did some papers from me of some sort.

21:10.550 --> 21:18.720
And she must have realized that I had problems and that I didn't really particularly want to go in the health center at the time.

21:18.780 --> 21:25.709
And she suggested that she bring the papers out and I drove up.

21:26.550 --> 21:29.113
I think her excuse was that I couldn't, there was no place to park.

21:29.413 --> 21:34.279
Oh, they had stopped parking in front of the health center altogether then.

21:34.259 --> 21:38.585
And she met me on the front steps and gave me the papers.

21:38.866 --> 21:42.531
I think there was a whole lot more to it than she ever told me.

21:43.092 --> 21:51.344
But nevertheless, that's a low point, just missing all of those things.

21:51.945 --> 21:53.186
What about goofy?

21:54.108 --> 21:55.430
Goofy, goofy.

21:55.790 --> 22:01.178
Oh surely there were thousands of goofy things.

22:03.082 --> 22:06.767
Something got mixed up, some student had some goofy idea.

22:10.453 --> 22:16.982
I'm assuming that there was never any attempt by the students at any kind of jokes or pranks in or around the health center.

22:18.104 --> 22:18.965
No, no.

22:19.486 --> 22:22.771
Other than perhaps going on pass and coming back drunk.

22:24.093 --> 22:24.313
Yeah.

22:26.616 --> 22:29.140
No, no pranks.

22:31.668 --> 22:33.450
Goofy is really hard for me.

22:35.653 --> 22:37.355
I'm sure there's some things there.

22:37.515 --> 22:41.640
Nobody got any medication horribly mixed up?

22:41.800 --> 22:46.205
No, not that I ever knew about.

22:46.786 --> 22:50.851
Let's see, and there were no... Oh, interesting.

22:51.872 --> 22:58.039
I was such a... So cold-natured, they call me.

22:58.119 --> 23:00.662
I had the air conditioning turned down.

23:01.739 --> 23:05.286
that they were always talking about it.

23:06.087 --> 23:11.277
And I went up one time, I think I was on call, but I went up one time after hours.

23:12.359 --> 23:18.931
The nurses had mufflers on and mittens and stocking caps and so forth.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.414
They didn't say a word to me.

23:20.935 --> 23:23.359
They just walked around like that.

23:23.643 --> 23:29.069
Including Elizabeth Taylor who, dear sweet thing, she has since died of heart disease herself.

23:29.510 --> 23:32.573
Great, great big fat black woman.

23:32.593 --> 23:37.118
I don't know if you, I mean she was an easy 400 pounds.

23:37.659 --> 23:40.602
I never tangled with her but I would sure hate to tangle with her.

23:41.243 --> 23:47.710
One time she bumped up against me sort of like just in fun like that you know.

23:47.690 --> 23:50.714
I mean, she just almost knocked me down.

23:50.774 --> 23:55.561
But she was just a wonderful, wonderful person.

23:57.123 --> 23:58.025
And I remember her.

23:58.205 --> 24:03.052
I can see her right now in the muffler and the mittens and the cap and so forth.

24:03.452 --> 24:05.155
And they didn't say anything to me about it.

24:05.195 --> 24:07.458
They just presented themselves that way.

24:09.381 --> 24:17.292
What did you do as a diversion hobby, relaxation, by yourself or with your wife?

24:19.280 --> 24:22.724
Oh, gee whiz, not much.

24:24.787 --> 24:27.650
I essentially didn't take any vacation.

24:29.612 --> 24:46.232
When I worked my last day on August the 18th, Wheezy tells me it is, I thought it was the 22nd, I got paychecks, full paychecks,

24:47.495 --> 24:53.403
without even being present at the health center through July.

24:54.304 --> 24:55.345
That was all vacation.

24:55.365 --> 24:57.288
I don't know how much it was.

24:58.850 --> 25:01.493
But I seldom took any vacation days.

25:03.616 --> 25:05.138
But when you were home, what did you do?

25:05.158 --> 25:06.820
When I was at home.

25:07.660 --> 25:08.702
Didn't hunt, didn't fish?

25:08.862 --> 25:10.745
Don't hunt, don't fish.

25:12.508 --> 25:20.100
And by the way, I'm left-handed, so I would shoot a gun if I shot a gun on my left shoulder.

25:20.741 --> 25:26.791
And I've got my implanted device up here so I could never shoot a gun again.

25:26.811 --> 25:32.520
No hobbies?

25:36.601 --> 25:37.584
Not to speak of.

25:38.005 --> 25:39.951
No, that's awful, Haskell.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.355
Were you in the choir?

25:41.716 --> 25:44.685
Of course, we were in the choir from the very first day.

25:44.845 --> 25:51.505
The first day we joined the church, by the way, was the day that Harold Wells died.

25:53.662 --> 25:55.527
My, my.

25:56.469 --> 25:59.096
He, I forget his name, wife's name too.

25:59.537 --> 25:59.999
Helen?

26:00.299 --> 26:01.462
Charlotte.

26:01.543 --> 26:01.944
Charlotte.

26:01.964 --> 26:02.706
Charlotte, of course.

26:03.728 --> 26:10.185
And the first day we joined the church, she called here.

26:10.165 --> 26:14.712
and ask if, what, just ask for my advice, what to do.

26:15.252 --> 26:18.597
And I said, by all means, go directly to the St.

26:18.617 --> 26:19.278
Joseph's Hospital.

26:19.659 --> 26:22.322
I said, I can't treat him because I'm not on staff there.

26:23.164 --> 26:29.793
And at that stage, he was in a sweat, I mean a cold sweat, and was having pain.

26:30.915 --> 26:33.899
And he died the next day, or died that night.

26:34.240 --> 26:36.403
This is the First Presbyterian Church and Bryan.

26:37.084 --> 26:39.447
Yeah, First Presbyterian and Bryan.

26:39.713 --> 26:41.735
How did you all happen to pick that church?

26:41.935 --> 26:46.940
Well, I'm a Presbyterian, have always been, and I'll tell you how we picked it.

26:49.142 --> 27:04.095
We were going to visit all kinds of churches, and so we gravitated to the Presbyterian church first, and the organ was so pretty that I said, here we are.

27:04.135 --> 27:05.216
This is it.

27:05.356 --> 27:08.019
We don't need to bother to go anywhere else.

27:08.519 --> 27:09.400
As a matter of fact,

27:09.852 --> 27:15.639
I moved away from the church, went to that other smaller Presbyterian church.

27:17.582 --> 27:20.566
Wheezy says, don't you want to try that church?

27:20.626 --> 27:22.128
I said, absolutely not.

27:22.308 --> 27:23.730
I'm staying with the organ.

27:23.770 --> 27:31.219
So it was bad, exactly.

27:31.452 --> 27:33.615
sort of assumption that I would be a Presbyterian.

27:34.597 --> 27:39.024
And so the whole family has been raised Presbyterian now.

27:40.506 --> 27:46.977
But yes, every Wednesday night, every Sunday in the choir ever since the first day.

27:47.077 --> 27:47.698
For both of you?

27:47.718 --> 27:48.499
For both of us.

27:48.952 --> 27:52.377
And had you done much singing before coming here?

27:52.697 --> 27:53.799
In the choir, yeah.

27:54.260 --> 27:59.427
Even from the time I was in the Air Force and of course when we were in Hendersonville.

28:02.312 --> 28:06.758
Do you have favorite kinds of music?

28:08.915 --> 28:12.079
You mean like to play on a CD player for instance?

28:12.160 --> 28:13.782
Well what music do you enjoy most?

28:14.022 --> 28:16.586
To listen to and sing?

28:18.288 --> 28:24.797
As a class, classical music, Broadway music, and that's what the collection I have.

28:25.078 --> 28:28.122
That's one of my hobbies, I just listen to music.

28:28.102 --> 28:31.285
That's not much I know, nothing to show for it.

28:31.645 --> 28:43.076
But nevertheless, as far as singing in church, probably the prettiest music is Mozart's.

28:43.836 --> 28:44.557
Everything he wrote.

28:45.378 --> 28:49.401
There has been a time in my life when I didn't like anything that Mozart wrote.

28:50.102 --> 28:52.364
Now I like everything that Mozart wrote.

28:52.404 --> 28:55.527
And what caused the change, I have no idea.

28:55.507 --> 28:57.630
It just came to my senses, I suppose.

28:57.670 --> 28:59.373
And you saw the movie Amadeus.

28:59.794 --> 29:00.775
Maybe, maybe.

29:00.795 --> 29:05.222
Let me turn it off.

29:05.283 --> 29:10.130
I remember a stupid thing that happened in undergraduate school at Duke, and I just got to mention it.

29:12.093 --> 29:14.698
We lived on the third floor of the dorm.

29:14.718 --> 29:16.280
They're gothic sort of dorms.

29:16.701 --> 29:18.504
Slate roofs and all.

29:18.524 --> 29:20.046
These deep ones, as a matter of fact.

29:20.667 --> 29:28.427
This is in a corner and in the corner is a little sort of a turret type thing.

29:28.607 --> 29:29.590
We were on the third floor.

29:31.354 --> 29:36.347
And oh, in the wee hours of the morning we dared a friend.

29:36.327 --> 29:37.168
to jump out.

29:37.268 --> 29:45.100
There was a tree, one of those evergreen trees, the kind that will bend over if you, you know, jump on the top.

29:45.661 --> 29:53.613
Dared him to jump out there, jump out that window and literally fly through the air and grab that tree and go down the tree.

29:54.014 --> 29:54.775
And he did.

29:54.755 --> 29:55.996
I'll never forget it.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.903
It had snowed, and we had a snowball fight.

30:02.483 --> 30:12.754
We would get snow off the roof, and the water was almost that deep in the halls where the snow had melted, and we got in trouble that night.

30:13.775 --> 30:17.579
But I can't think of any goofy darn things in the health center.

30:17.619 --> 30:18.660
No hijinks.

30:18.721 --> 30:22.905
Nobody ever got up and tried to run out in their

30:23.645 --> 30:27.809
skivvies or nobody smuggled any food in or anything like that?

30:27.989 --> 30:29.611
No, why do you suppose that was?

30:29.691 --> 30:33.375
Were we so straight-laced if they wouldn't do something like that?

30:33.795 --> 30:36.278
I don't know.

30:36.798 --> 30:39.281
All right, looking back on... If something occurs to me, I'll let you know.

30:39.681 --> 30:45.287
All right, looking back on all these years, to whom are you most grateful here?

30:49.251 --> 30:49.551
For whatever?

30:52.838 --> 30:53.639
Several people.

30:55.101 --> 30:57.703
Jack Williams, of course, has to be in the list.

30:58.424 --> 30:59.105
Howard Perry.

31:00.006 --> 31:04.411
Howard Perry was sort of my, I guess, my mentor, really.

31:05.532 --> 31:08.456
And finish with him, but then why Williams?

31:08.996 --> 31:09.957
I think I know, but why?

31:10.598 --> 31:12.060
Oh, gee, everything, really.

31:12.120 --> 31:15.083
His whole personality.

31:18.522 --> 31:23.436
He also knew how I was running the health center and let me do it.
