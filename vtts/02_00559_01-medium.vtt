WEBVTT

00:06.680 --> 00:09.903
I have two too louds, two too softs.

00:14.889 --> 00:15.950
Well, how's this then? All right? We have to begin 
in order to get through our program and get on with

00:19.374 --> 00:23.538
the next sessions. I have a few comments to make, 
and we have a few other brief comments, and then

00:25.080 --> 00:35.691
we'll get on to the major event, the Pilgrim Award. 
I, of course, although it is the third day, want to

00:36.008 --> 00:47.305
offer an official welcome to you on behalf of the 
conference, SFRA 83, and also the Science Fiction

00:36.008 --> 00:47.305
Research Association. We have among our midst not 
only you people, our members, but also a number of

00:48.146 --> 00:54.456
distinguished special guests. We have some 
people from the local community too. I want to

00:57.906 --> 01:00.108
mention a few of their names. I think one of the 
things that made this meeting unique and

01:01.210 --> 01:13.544
different has been its participation and 
cooperation with the local festival, the Arts and

01:01.210 --> 01:13.544
Science Matrix Midland. We have with us some 
people from Matrix Midland, and I'd like to

01:14.245 --> 01:20.132
introduce them to you at this time. We had a science 
subcommittee that planned this portion of the

01:20.753 --> 01:24.898
program, So if you didn't like it, then it's our 
responsibility. If you did, say so. But not yet.

01:36.101 --> 01:37.122
Where is he seated? Pat McCurdy, would you stand 
up, please? Pat McCurdy and his wife. His wife's

01:42.209 --> 01:44.912
with him there. Pat and I and another gentleman, 
Richard Dalton, who could not be with us today, did

01:45.500 --> 01:54.714
the planning basically for this program. But of 
course, planning would be nothing without

01:55.215 --> 02:08.436
execution and without the great resources and the 
great facilities available here in the community

01:55.215 --> 02:08.436
of Midland with the Center for the Arts and also 
with organizations like Matrix. And we have a

02:08.753 --> 02:17.646
spokesperson here from Matrix who will say a few 
words and give you Matrix greetings. And when I

02:17.666 --> 02:24.757
introduce her, I'd like you to not only welcome 
her, but also show your appreciation for Matrix.

02:25.278 --> 02:31.427
She too is here with her husband, Herbert Doan, 
seated at the table here of Doan Associates in

02:25.278 --> 02:31.427
Midland. And I present to you now one of the leaders 
in Matrix, Junior Doan, please.

02:42.233 --> 02:45.197
Nice to see a crowd of your size in Midland. I'd like 
to add my welcome to you all, to Midland, to Matrix

02:45.257 --> 02:49.903
Midland, to our fair community. I hope you're all 
briefed by now that Matrix Midland is a 19-day

02:49.923 --> 02:56.270
festival of the arts, sciences, and humanities. 
For a speech to Rotary, I researched 3,500

02:56.851 --> 03:02.238
festivals, and I finally concluded that Matrix is 
unique. What makes it unique is that we're trying

03:03.139 --> 03:08.005
to show the arts-science relationship, the 
arts-science blend. Basically, I feel that's

03:08.710 --> 03:15.183
what science fiction is about, combining science 
and the art of writing to produce science fiction.

03:16.185 --> 03:19.872
Certainly, science fiction is a blend of science, 
creativity, and imagination. From earliest

03:20.573 --> 03:25.904
days, science fiction saw directions in science 
and projected them into the future. Often, they

03:26.746 --> 03:27.968
proved correct. Many of our creative people in 
Midland are avid science fiction fans. Science

03:32.931 --> 03:39.042
fiction seems to appeal to the creative in at least 
a certain sector of the population. However,

03:39.964 --> 03:49.962
rejection of original ideas, as you all probably 
know better than I, is common in many fields, in

03:39.964 --> 03:49.962
science, in art, as well as writing and science 
fiction. I'd like to remind you critics about what

03:53.058 --> 03:55.903
Frank Herbert said this morning. I don't guess you 
were there, but he commented that his first Dune

03:56.103 --> 04:04.659
book was turned down 20 times before being 
accepted for publication. That's a lot, huh? The

04:08.966 --> 04:13.935
same thing happened in a different area in a 
different way to Professor Notta. He developed a

04:14.202 --> 04:23.597
new theory of polymers, and he presented his first 
paper on this new theory to the American Chemical

04:14.202 --> 04:23.597
Society for publication. It was rejected. That 
might not mean anything to you, but the same theory

04:25.921 --> 04:32.892
later went on to win a Nobel Prize. Never mind the 
difficulties. It takes commitment and skill to be

04:35.757 --> 04:40.665
a scientist, a writer, or build a festival. Just as 
science fiction writers and critics meet to share

04:42.569 --> 04:56.766
and help each other, Matrix has the support and 
effort of what I call our helping hands, people who

04:42.569 --> 04:56.766
like the idea of Matrix, who invest their 
creativity, originality, and effort. Joe DeBolt

04:57.407 --> 05:07.159
is one of these hands and an important one, 
chairman of your research association meeting,

04:57.407 --> 05:07.159
co-chairman with Pat McCurry of the science 
fiction program at Matrix this year, we depended

05:07.139 --> 05:17.470
on him and his very high level ability and the 
committee's high level ability to bring the

05:07.139 --> 05:17.470
program that I hope you have seen and will continue 
to go to. In the same vein, one of the great things

05:18.563 --> 05:24.732
about MATRIX is that many groups in Midland play an 
active role. We have as co-participants dozens

05:24.752 --> 05:29.279
and dozens of institutions. I was talking with our 
table just now about some of them. In addition to

05:33.566 --> 05:40.736
meetings such as yours, we've had an ACS regional 
meeting, the Turner-Alfrey Polymer Conference,

05:33.566 --> 05:40.736
which has just ended. The Michigan Museum 
Association Conference is coming up next week.

05:44.382 --> 06:01.277
the michigan dance association starts today the 
michigan weavers guild is uh weekend after this

05:44.382 --> 06:01.277
and now we have your own so we really appreciate 
your being here and and part of our terrific

05:44.382 --> 06:01.277
community and our special matrix midland and i 
hope you'll like it well enough to come back again

05:44.382 --> 06:01.277
thank you

06:09.121 --> 06:10.203
Thank you, Junior. And now I should say a word and 
thanks, too, to the Science Fiction Research

06:11.645 --> 06:24.665
Association officers and the fine cooperation we 
got from them in the planning and execution of the

06:11.645 --> 06:24.665
meeting. And from this portion of the program on, I 
will turn over the program to our distinguished

06:25.586 --> 06:33.238
president, Patricia Warwick.

06:40.087 --> 06:49.050
As I start, I know you will all want to join me in 
applause for Joe and Denise DeBolt and their staff

06:40.087 --> 06:49.050
for the absolutely marvelous job that they've 
done on this.

06:56.236 --> 07:01.282
Science Christian Research Association is 13 
years old. And I've been coming for 10 years. And

07:04.126 --> 07:14.499
for me, one of the exciting parts is the pilgrim 
banquet or luncheon, whatever it may be, and the

07:04.126 --> 07:14.499
presentation of the winner of the Pilgrim Award. 
And we always have this suspense. Who may it be? And

07:16.782 --> 07:18.945
you look at who is here, is not in the program. You 
try to figure this out. and you're about to know the

07:20.367 --> 07:22.270
answer. Let me keep you in suspense just a moment 
longer when I pause to invite you all to come to a

07:22.650 --> 07:34.587
reception after the Herbert Lecture this evening 
in room 417. This is a hospitality room. We'll have

07:36.470 --> 07:43.260
a bar, and at least up to the point, it will not be a 
cash bar but a free bar, and I hope you will all come

07:36.470 --> 07:43.260
and join us then. Now, on to the Pilgrim Award, an 
award for outstanding contribution to

07:47.553 --> 07:51.339
criticism. Criticism is still alive and well. If 
you were at the Jim Gunn conference, which I know

07:55.365 --> 08:02.857
many of you were for the morning session, you 
realize how lively it is. I can remember 10 years

08:03.338 --> 08:15.096
ago when I attended my first meeting at Penn State 
and the critics and the writers got into a shout

08:03.338 --> 08:15.096
fest and we still maintain our high level of 
performance. As a matter of fact, the chairman of

08:15.734 --> 08:24.186
the Pilgrim Committee is Tom Dunn, and I'm about to 
introduce him after this morning's session. He

08:24.226 --> 08:28.292
came to me and said that he thought it would be 
appropriate for him to defer to A.J. Budris and let

08:28.332 --> 08:31.597
him present the Pilgrim Award. But I insisted, no, 
that Tom Dunn must do it, and so I give you Tom Dunn.

08:44.776 --> 08:48.119
Praise then darkness and creation unfinished. 
Colleagues, friends, every year since 1970, the

08:49.761 --> 09:03.553
Science Fiction Research Association has 
presented an award to someone for an outstanding

08:49.761 --> 09:03.553
contribution to the field of science fiction 
scholarship. The first such Pilgrim Award was

09:04.234 --> 09:09.579
presented in 1970 to the late J.O. Bailey, author 
of Pilgrims Through Space and Time, a pioneering

09:13.328 --> 09:21.876
work published in 1947, the first full-scale 
academic study devoted to the entire genre of

09:13.328 --> 09:21.876
science fiction. This year, we present the 14th 
award to a no less deserving pioneer, as you shall

09:22.837 --> 09:27.842
hear. But first, let me take a minute to thank the 
members of my committee for their conscientious,

09:28.603 --> 09:35.790
informed, and often impassioned deliberation. 
Make that always impassioned deliberation. Val

09:38.272 --> 09:39.994
Bregge in Montreal. Will McNally in Fullerton, 
California, Curtis Smith in Houston, and Carolyn

09:41.122 --> 09:48.291
Wendell in Rochester.

09:50.894 --> 09:51.355
Good work. Yes,

09:51.375 --> 09:55.860
thank you. Good work, people. My sincere thanks 
for a job well done. And thank you also for the

09:58.804 --> 10:01.447
wisdom of this year's choice. He's a courageous 
and principled man. And he's a first-rate

10:06.474 --> 10:09.137
scholar, world class. And he's made an 
outstanding contribution to SF scholarship. And

10:13.984 --> 10:15.066
he's a decent man. He's a kind man. He's a mensch. 
And he's a good teacher. He's won three awards for

10:20.356 --> 10:24.383
meritorious teaching, including Teacher of the 
Year. And as soon as I start getting specific here,

10:24.764 --> 10:28.170
you'll all know who he is. A few more appropriate 
adjectives then, and then an end to the suspense.

10:33.822 --> 10:35.607
He's tough and he's hard and lean. He's worked in 
factories. He's worked on tugboats. He was a naval

10:39.158 --> 10:47.022
and intelligence officer in the Strategic Air 
Command, participating in operations involving

10:39.158 --> 10:47.022
spy missions over the Soviet Union. He graduated 
magna cum laude from Amherst in 1955. And soon

10:52.496 --> 10:59.165
after his three-year hitch, he got a PhD in English 
and American Lit at Stanford. I see heads nodding

10:59.766 --> 11:00.927
now. And was invited to stay on after his degree as 
full-time faculty, the first Stanford graduate

11:01.828 --> 11:10.039
so honored in 33 years. In 1961, he taught one of the 
very first university-level courses on science

11:10.762 --> 11:31.584
fiction in the USA, disputably the first course, 
incidentally, and began a career as critic,

11:10.762 --> 11:31.584
scholar, teacher, social and political 
activist, which continues to this day without

11:10.762 --> 11:31.584
abatement to be astonishing and legendary in 
scope and volume and depth. In dozens of books and

11:32.805 --> 11:39.452
articles, he has given scholarly attention to 
Hamlet, Renaissance drama, Melville,

11:40.259 --> 11:45.127
Hawthorne, Darwin, Lenin, the youth movement, 
the Vietnam War, J.G. Ballard, Lovecraft. His

11:47.030 --> 11:51.076
anthology, Future Perfect, and now the cat's out 
of the bag, fair. Future Perfect, 19th century

11:51.617 --> 11:58.588
science fiction, is, I am told, still the 
definitive collection. In its field, but

11:58.872 --> 12:19.564
continuing on, The Politics of Literature, 
American Prison Literature and Prison Songs,

11:58.872 --> 12:19.564
Jack London, Fitz James O'Brien, Class Structure 
and the Teaching of English, The Need for Reform in

11:58.872 --> 12:19.564
Prison Education, American Plans for Space 
Weaponry, and in a jam of a book about which more

11:58.872 --> 12:19.564
later, Robert Heinlein, to hit most of the high 
points. He has taught at Stanford, Rutgers,

12:19.882 --> 12:31.478
Connecticut Wesleyan, Yale, Venseramos 
College, the Free University of Paris, Johns

12:19.882 --> 12:31.478
Hopkins, and San Jose's Department of Adult 
Education. He has refereed for some 25 university

12:32.183 --> 12:58.959
and scholarly presses, and his articles have 
appeared in over 60 learned journals,

12:32.183 --> 12:58.959
anthologies, and news publications, including 
The Futurist, Saturday Review, Science Fiction

12:32.183 --> 12:58.959
Studies, Extrapolation, Progressive Labor, The 
Washington Post, The Journal for the Society for

12:32.183 --> 12:58.959
the Study of Multi-Ethnic Literature of the US, 
The Chronicle of Higher Education, The Village

12:32.183 --> 12:58.959
Voice, and on and on and on. And if you don't know who 
he is by now, you should kick yourself. He has made

13:03.065 --> 13:15.381
over 100 public presentations in addition to this 
list and at more than 50 colleges and

13:03.065 --> 13:15.381
universities, and that's not counting an 
uncountable number of television and radio

13:03.065 --> 13:15.381
appearances. Oh, yes, and he's made three films, 
including with Anthony Boucher and Ted Sturgeon,

13:15.401 --> 13:23.272
I believe, a history of science fiction for NET 
made in 1966. Fellowships, grants and aids,

13:24.433 --> 13:28.198
awards have come his way and continue to come. I 
said astonishing, didn't I? I also said

13:31.820 --> 13:33.542
legendary. How legendary? Well, his early 
interest in the civil rights movement turned to

13:37.025 --> 13:43.411
growing concern over US Southeast Asian 
involvement. And while many of us, to our later

13:44.031 --> 14:00.747
regret, waffled and tap danced circumspectly 
through the Vietnam tragedy, certainly through

13:44.031 --> 14:00.747
the early years for some, this English teacher 
threw himself headlong into the struggle to stop

13:44.031 --> 14:00.747
it and into the contemporaneous and growing 
movement for social and political change. In

14:01.351 --> 14:08.222
1966, he resigned his commission as captain in the 
Air Force Reserve in specific protest against the

14:01.351 --> 14:08.222
war. Now an avowed communist, he debated the 
president of Rockford College on the hidden power

14:08.963 --> 14:15.855
structure of American universities. And in the 
next five years, he published and lectured

14:15.875 --> 14:26.532
tirelessly on the war, the politics of 
revolution, the nature of American

14:15.875 --> 14:26.532
institutions, universities, foreign policy, 
and economic imperialism. In 1971, he gathered

14:26.917 --> 14:36.067
together every major document from the student 
and protest movement and published them in a

14:26.917 --> 14:36.067
large, inexpensive, soft cover volume. And 
though it was regrettably heavily censored, From

14:36.828 --> 14:44.055
the Movement Toward Revolution should be 
applauded by all those who cherish academic

14:36.828 --> 14:44.055
freedom. As you well know, not all do. Our award 
recipient was fired for his political activism.

14:51.453 --> 15:04.415
His defense, The Real Issues in My Case, is the 
cover article of Change, the magazine of higher

14:51.453 --> 15:04.415
learning, June 1972, and this is better amplified 
in his autobiography. Some regard this episode as

15:05.517 --> 15:12.028
just punishment, others as cruel, not to mention 
unconstitutional, martyrdom. Either way, he

15:12.910 --> 15:15.975
endured it with grace and later prevailed. and 
many far to the right of the far left now regard most

15:16.732 --> 15:34.842
or all of his stern criticism of american 
economics and government policies to have been

15:16.732 --> 15:34.842
justified a legend then of personal courage and 
political concern which testifies to his

15:16.732 --> 15:34.842
singular excellence in all this Is all this 
relevant to his work with science fiction? You bet

15:40.510 --> 15:41.531
your life it is. He's never seen the inside of an 
ivory tower, or if he has, it doesn't show. He

15:46.478 --> 16:05.723
integrates literature, politics, human and 
humane goals, his vast experience with America

15:46.478 --> 16:05.723
and Americans, and he pours it all into his 
tireless labors, which, in 1980, gave us a

15:46.478 --> 16:05.723
definitive essay on the massive canon of the dean, 
Robert A. Heinlein, subtitled America as Science

15:46.478 --> 16:05.723
Fiction. is a brilliant study of, and I quote, 
lucid and trenchant analysis, in the words of a

16:06.074 --> 16:13.008
rigorous critic. And again, quote, bristling 
with insights, end quote. And here, it seems to me,

16:17.157 --> 16:19.722
is the harvest of his life. Having paid heavy dues, 
He has written a sensitive book without

16:22.207 --> 16:33.603
condescension or petulance, a forceful critique 
of American values by way of a thorough analysis of

16:22.207 --> 16:33.603
a major exponent of those values. Written in a 
plain spoken, deft, clear-eyed prose, informed

16:34.103 --> 16:40.793
by vast erudition with deep roots in the American 
soil. Okay, here we go. For all that he has done for

16:44.077 --> 16:49.885
us, capital U, capital S, let us now praise Bruce 
Franklin.

17:02.555 --> 17:19.734
Well,

17:02.555 --> 17:19.734
thank you so much. I must say after that, I'm sort of 
at a loss for words. This is really wonderful, and

17:24.997 --> 17:32.167
that introduction is a hard thing to follow. I 
wanted to talk some about what I see as the history

17:32.587 --> 17:45.825
of our field, some things that happened in the 
past, what changed it, and where we are now. And I

17:49.273 --> 18:01.743
was going to cite as an example of something that I 
thought was rather staggering, a minor little

17:49.273 --> 18:01.743
fact, but what was said about Frank Herbeck topped 
it. That is, back in those primitive days of 1964,

18:02.164 --> 18:13.934
when I had Future Perfect pretty much ready to go, I 
submitted it to publishers. It was rejected. by 17

18:15.235 --> 18:20.601
publishers, not as many as the 20 that rejected 
Frank Herbert. But the interesting thing was the

18:20.621 --> 18:28.550
reason for the rejection, which in case after case 
will basically boil down to this. There is a

18:29.191 --> 18:37.701
science fiction market and there is an academic 
market, and there's no possible way that you can

18:29.191 --> 18:37.701
put the two things together. They're absolutely 
incompatible. Well, by around 1965 or 60s, no,

18:40.936 --> 19:01.047
about 1960, I'm sorry, 1968, it finally got 
published in 66, around 68, 69, some of those same

18:40.936 --> 19:01.047
publishers were writing to ask if I would do a book 
for the academic science fiction market, which I

18:40.936 --> 19:01.047
guess we represent. Well, by 68, I think, and 
certainly by now, would pretty much won the

19:04.814 --> 19:12.105
battle. The war, maybe. I guess there were still 
battles going on. Science fiction now is

19:16.812 --> 19:24.764
essentially a fixture of the American academy. It 
is part of the environment. We are no longer, for

19:27.342 --> 19:43.852
the most part, considered the loonies and 
eccentrics that we were looked on back in, say, 61,

19:27.342 --> 19:43.852
62, 63, 64, 65, when we first started teaching 
science fiction courses. It's a lot easier to get

19:43.872 --> 19:46.937
things published now. we no longer have to 
legitimize the existence of our field. That is, I

19:53.565 --> 19:57.089
think, generally regarded as some kind of 
legitimate thing. Although, of course, those of

19:57.109 --> 20:09.861
us who are in colleges and universities know the 
kinds of attacks that it is subjected to by people

19:57.109 --> 20:09.861
who have very different values about what 
literature is all about. That's in the academy.

20:12.383 --> 20:17.768
And part of the reason, of course, is because the 
importance of science fiction itself can now

20:18.457 --> 20:20.740
hardly be in doubt. I think that any thinking 
person in America today knows that science

20:21.522 --> 20:39.148
fiction forms part of the center of the 
imagination of our entire culture, for better and

20:21.522 --> 20:39.148
for worse. So that our job now, I think, is very 
different from the job back in the, let's say, 58,

20:40.023 --> 20:52.108
when the science fiction seminar first gets 
started in the MLA or the early 60s. It really is no

20:52.848 --> 21:00.636
longer essentially a job of legitimizing our 
field, legitimizing the serious study of science

20:52.848 --> 21:00.636
fiction. We're in the maturity of our field now. We 
need to define, to distinguish certain things.

21:08.464 --> 21:18.655
And essentially, and this is really the main theme 
of what I'm going to say, our role is now critical in

21:08.464 --> 21:18.655
every sense of that word. And we really ought to 
think about what that word means to us. Let's

21:23.459 --> 21:39.275
think, just to get some perspective, of some 
examples of science fiction within our culture,

21:23.459 --> 21:39.275
not necessarily the things that we pick up in the 
bookstore that are labeled science fiction or the

21:23.459 --> 21:39.275
movies that we see that are labeled science 
fiction. I think it's safe to say that the most

21:40.056 --> 21:50.327
expensive piece of science fiction which has been 
produced so far is Epcot. It's a billion-dollar

21:50.982 --> 22:07.777
center, the experimental prototype community of 
tomorrow, that ultra-optimistic science

21:50.982 --> 22:07.777
fiction created by some gigantic multinational 
corporations of the 1980s. Wall Street itself

22:08.737 --> 22:20.888
echoes with rhetoric and visions and slogans, 
consciously evoking the wow, gosh, thrills of the

22:08.737 --> 22:20.888
most simple-minded science fiction. Focus on the 
future is emblazoned across the top of a full-page

22:21.610 --> 22:33.499
futuristic electronic environment advertising 
a new institution with the most ironic name. It's a

22:33.559 --> 22:35.323
little over a year old now. The New York Futures 
Exchange. Dean Witter Reynolds asked us to put our

22:39.683 --> 22:54.337
own present and future wealth in the hands of what 
it calls its team of futures experts called,

22:39.683 --> 22:54.337
capital T, capital F, the Futurists. The Kansas 
City Board of Trade advertises itself with a jazzy

22:55.779 --> 23:02.866
logo and the slogan, the future is here. Northrop 
shows itself as a futuristic city under the bold

23:02.906 --> 23:09.252
heading, Northrop engineers in the 21st century. 
The science fiction hype of high technology

23:13.952 --> 23:21.266
corporations becomes so frantic that they 
themselves begin complaining. This is a quote

23:21.286 --> 23:25.013
from the New York Times of April 28, 1981. We still 
haven't licked the Buck Rogers problem yet, says

23:25.448 --> 23:48.393
James L. Donovan, Coherent, this is Coherent 
Radiation, used to be called Coherent Radiation,

23:25.448 --> 23:48.393
Coherent's chief financial officer, referring 
to the struggle of Coherent and many other laser

23:25.448 --> 23:48.393
manufacturers to overcome the science fiction 
image that has been created for lasers as exotic,

23:25.448 --> 23:48.393
powerful, and dangerous devices. Curious, that 
sounds a little dated now, two years later, the

23:49.154 --> 23:53.599
reasons there were. We heard something about it 
last night. We'll hear something more about it in a

23:56.201 --> 23:57.943
little while. While billions of dollars pour into 
the video game industry with its ecstatic visions

23:58.864 --> 24:16.870
and thrilling beeps of global, cosmic and 
universal combat and destruction, other

23:58.864 --> 24:16.870
billions are taken out of our paychecks to finance 
the militarization of space. which is sold to

24:17.660 --> 24:24.429
Congress and the public with the most bizarre and 
implausible science fiction scenarios. And

24:25.210 --> 24:45.658
we're still paying for the science fiction 
visions that we could conquer Vietnam by

24:25.210 --> 24:45.658
utilizing an electronic battlefield, people 
sniffers, and chemical warfare weapons

24:25.210 --> 24:45.658
exotically labeled Agent White, Agent Blue, and 
Agent Orange, which I guess brings us back to

24:25.210 --> 24:45.658
Midland. I

24:47.056 --> 24:56.574
have a little cluster, a little cluster right out 
of the middle of 1980. This is the science fiction

24:56.855 --> 25:00.181
environment in which we live. The first is a 
quotation from an investment bulletin called

25:00.221 --> 25:09.840
High Technology Investments, April, May, 1980. 
These little companies have seen a vision of the

25:10.681 --> 25:19.674
future and have set out to capture it under the 
leadership of a few brainy, vigorous, and worldly

25:10.681 --> 25:19.674
people. The values being tested are 
technological wit, courage, stamina, greed, and

25:20.075 --> 25:29.729
glory, right out of the 19th century, plunging 
into the 21st. Here's one from the New York Times

25:32.233 --> 25:36.840
the next month, June 18th. The Central 
Intelligence Agency's secret experiments on new

25:37.327 --> 25:53.606
methods of espionage have included using trained 
seals and otters, monitoring the bioplasma

25:37.327 --> 25:53.606
fields of agents, and testing the sonar of 
electric fish, according to documents newly made

25:37.327 --> 25:53.606
public. The experimenters also worked on 
developing such weapons as a poison pellet,

25:54.006 --> 26:04.498
electric stun guns, calibrated blackjacks, and 
marshmallow barrages.

26:06.959 --> 26:20.917
The intelligence agency's research and 
development staff was also interested in the

26:06.959 --> 26:20.917
secret life of plants, peace pills, and an array of 
other futuristic scenes. Two months later, at the

26:20.937 --> 26:36.257
Democratic Party convention, then President 
Jimmy Carter, in his acceptance speech,

26:20.937 --> 26:36.257
projected two alternative science fictions as 
the core of his acceptance speech. His governing

26:36.237 --> 26:39.781
metaphor was that there were two futures. There's 
a quote from his acceptance speech. The president

26:43.146 --> 26:47.091
is the servant of today, but his true constituency 
is the future. That's why the election of 1980 is so

26:47.451 --> 26:49.754
important. It's a choice between two futures. 
Children born this year will come of age in the 21st

26:52.938 --> 26:56.322
century. The time to shape the world of the year 
2100 is now. And then he gives his own, the future he

27:00.512 --> 27:06.502
represents, a future of confidence and hope and a 
good life, blah, blah, blah. And then the other

27:07.023 --> 27:07.724
one. But there's another possible future. And 
that other future I see despair, a world of tinsel

27:09.427 --> 27:14.596
and make-believe, a fantasy world. Same month. 
Wall Street Journal has an article on what to them

27:17.176 --> 27:22.525
was a new phenomenon, video games. Quote, video 
madness is sweeping the country with flashing

27:23.407 --> 27:35.107
colors, booming explosions, nerve-tingling 
action, and little electronic monsters like the

27:23.407 --> 27:35.107
invaders from space that adorn this article. And 
there we were in the day pages of the Wall Street

27:35.387 --> 27:38.172
Journal, a little... the little critters from 
various video games. Of course, that was all this

27:41.575 --> 27:43.777
1980. And for most of the Wall Street Journal 
readers, that was then news. That was before some

27:48.222 --> 27:55.028
of those readers would be investing billions more 
dollars in the video game industry. By 1983, this

27:55.969 --> 28:07.720
year, a few months ago, March, we see how fast and 
far we came just on that little front in three

27:55.969 --> 28:07.720
years. It's about President Reagan's headline. 
Reagan says, video games provide the right stuff.

28:15.183 --> 28:21.790
President Reagan had some kind words for video 
games, which he said are helping to train a new

28:15.183 --> 28:21.790
generation of jet pilots. Mr. Reagan, speaking to 
a group of math and science students at the Walt

28:23.432 --> 28:37.386
Disney Epcot Center here, said video games have 
helped many young people develop, quote,

28:23.432 --> 28:37.386
incredible hand, eye, and brain coordination. 
Mr. Reagan said, computerized video screens

28:37.822 --> 28:43.028
resemble radar screens in jet cockpits. Watch a 
12-year-old take evasive action and score

28:43.048 --> 28:52.859
multiple hits while playing space invaders, and 
you will appreciate the skills of tomorrow's

28:43.048 --> 28:52.859
pilots, the president said. Well, of course, that 
is part of what we see really, I think, as a contest

28:55.322 --> 29:05.053
between two different forms of science fiction 
having to do with space. I did an article... It

29:07.336 --> 29:19.067
appeared in the beginning of 82, called Invasion 
of Space, about what was developing along the

29:07.336 --> 29:19.067
lines of the militarization of space, which 
Battle stations in space bristling with energy

29:20.127 --> 29:38.340
beam cannons, hunter-killer satellites firing 
grid-like projectiles too tenuous to be

29:20.127 --> 29:38.340
targeted, swarms of automated space mines 
shielding orbited command posts that direct

29:20.127 --> 29:38.340
squadrons of diminutive space cruisers. Well, 
this kind of scene that once gave respectable

29:39.142 --> 29:43.570
science fiction a bad name is now part of the future 
being planned for us. A different kind of science

29:47.753 --> 30:00.006
fiction in which the human race matures, unites, 
and together explores the cosmos now seems less

29:47.753 --> 30:00.006
probable than it did just a few years ago. As 
recently as 1975, US Apollo astronauts linked up

30:00.046 --> 30:13.540
with Soviet Soyuz cosmonauts in a handshake that 
momentarily made space a zone of scientific

30:00.046 --> 30:13.540
cooperation and even friendship but today the u.s 
program for scientific exploration of space has

30:13.520 --> 30:36.422
been almost entirely usurped by a program for the 
military exploitation of space high place

30:13.520 --> 30:36.422
pentagon officials now talk of possible space 
battles between the united states and the soviet

30:13.520 --> 30:36.422
union sometime between 1990 And 2010. Well, see, 
the interrelations between our field and all

30:38.726 --> 30:46.598
this, the actual environment we as human beings 
have our existence, I think, is pretty obvious.

30:46.939 --> 30:49.983
Maybe there's some other things that are less 
obvious. I presented a paper in December at the MLA

30:50.805 --> 30:59.338
about late 19th and early 20th century science 
fiction, the construction of the myths. that have

30:59.318 --> 31:01.301
a lot to do with our culture. And it focused quite a 
bit on Edgar Rice Burroughs, who, after all, when

31:01.541 --> 31:24.313
we think about Star Wars and so forth, I mean, 
Burroughs was the one who really got the whole

31:01.541 --> 31:24.313
thing of subsidiary rights and all the little 
animals and creatures and so forth and the

31:01.541 --> 31:24.313
t-shirts and candy going as science fiction adds a 
multi-billion dollar spin-off industry. I

31:24.665 --> 31:35.825
talked about Burroughs' particular vision of the 
world and how the myths in Burroughs have their

31:24.665 --> 31:35.825
influence in our culture. Then, when was it? Oh, it 
was just a few months later. Again, it was March 83.

31:42.496 --> 31:46.403
People probably saw this article in Parade, What 
Famous People Read. uh and they and they

31:46.720 --> 32:14.263
interviewed the president reagan about uh his 
reading uh i realized all my reading left me an

31:46.720 --> 32:14.263
abiding belief in the triumph of good over evil uh 
and what was the main thing he cited edgar rice

31:46.720 --> 32:14.263
borrows his quote from president reagan not only 
his tarzan stories but also his science fiction

31:46.720 --> 32:14.263
john carter of mars the warlord of mars all the john 
carter books There's another kind of relation.

32:18.646 --> 32:35.084
It's interesting how little we have taught, even 
here, I know there's going to be a panel on this

32:18.646 --> 32:35.084
tomorrow, but so far, about what is, after all, the 
number one fact of our existence. The fact that

32:35.164 --> 32:38.648
with our science, Having delved into the very 
forces that constitute matter, we have now

32:39.353 --> 32:52.537
created the ability to exterminate at least human 
civilization as we know it, probably the human

32:39.353 --> 32:52.537
race, many times over. Now, there's been some very 
interesting writing on the psychological

32:53.178 --> 33:00.552
effects of this, because we know that... In order 
to function in our life, it is necessary for us to

33:01.493 --> 33:08.022
screen out a lot of information. We have to narrow 
the information that comes through to our

33:08.202 --> 33:13.890
consciousness. Part of this process has been 
called a process of numbing parts of our mind to all

33:13.970 --> 33:23.603
the data that are constantly coming in as input. 
And one of the striking phenomena about a world

33:23.923 --> 33:31.433
enveloped in nuclearism with this threat to our 
existence is so much of that is screened out, that

33:31.413 --> 33:37.035
this numbing does take place. In the classroom I 
had a most startling demonstration of this,

33:42.162 --> 33:54.554
giving a quiz on those, and they've just read some 
short stories this week, and I usually give just a

33:42.162 --> 33:54.554
brief quiz before we talk about things, so they get 
to say something before I do. One of the stories was

33:56.316 --> 33:58.037
All You Zombies. Another was I Have No Mouth and I 
Must Scream. And there were only three students in

34:03.102 --> 34:12.051
a fairly large class that saw the nuclear bomb in 
either of those two stories. And of course,

34:13.685 --> 34:15.708
they're central in both. There are many critics of 
science fiction writing about all these zombies

34:15.969 --> 34:22.599
who don't see exactly how important the bombs are 
there. So this interface between the literature

34:23.200 --> 34:34.898
we teach and the living environment in which we 
have our being is not a trivial matter. We too, I

34:36.180 --> 34:39.726
think, do a lot of numbing in our own consciousness 
of what it is that we do with science fiction.

34:49.523 --> 34:57.496
Let's go back to that time when science fiction was 
winning its acceptance as something more or less

34:49.523 --> 34:57.496
respectable. Why was it then? What were the 
special historical factors then that made it? I

35:04.647 --> 35:09.554
think 68's a good date, if we're going to pick a 
date. It's a little questionable to pick an exact

35:10.396 --> 35:14.582
date, but 68's a very good one. And I think the 68, 
I'm sure most people here remember, what was

35:14.942 --> 35:22.013
there, talk about a sign of the times. No, Judith 
Merrill remembers it. The advertisement in

35:25.659 --> 35:31.988
Galaxy and then also elsewhere, I think it first 
appeared in June 68. And there were two lists of

35:32.238 --> 35:40.768
people, one on one page, one on the other, 72 on one 
side, 82 on the other, all science fiction

35:32.238 --> 35:40.768
writers. 72 said, we the undersigned believe the 
United States must remain in Vietnam to fulfill

35:40.788 --> 35:48.737
its responsibilities to the people of that 
country. And the 82 on the other side said, we

35:49.057 --> 35:55.304
oppose the participation of the United States in 
the war in Vietnam. That was the context of 1968.

36:01.111 --> 36:18.372
was the year in which the modern language 
association finally allowed us in the science

36:01.111 --> 36:18.372
fiction seminar to have this big forum at MLA, 
which was very well attended, really marked the

36:01.111 --> 36:18.372
stamp of acceptance on what we do. I remember I was 
chairing that forum, but there was a problem. And

36:24.989 --> 36:38.245
that is, there was also a big sit-in in the same 
hotel because Louis Kahn, if people remember

36:24.989 --> 36:38.245
this, had been arrested for putting up a poster 
with scotch tape on a marble pillow. And I had to

36:38.265 --> 36:43.111
kind of shuttle back and forth between the sit-in 
and the forum. Now, were these unrelated events?

36:48.257 --> 36:50.440
Was it just by chance? that science fiction began 
to be recognized as something very important to

36:50.723 --> 37:03.727
our social experience in this particular time, 
and especially in 1968, maybe the year right

36:50.723 --> 37:03.727
before and right after? Was it coincidence? that 
at the very same time that science fiction was

37:06.552 --> 37:26.842
getting accepted as something which belonged in 
the university, that other forms of popular

37:06.552 --> 37:26.842
literature were also being accepted, that 
literature by non-white people was for the first

37:06.552 --> 37:26.842
time getting into the curriculum of the 
universities, or rather the first time since the

37:06.552 --> 37:26.842
1930s, that literature by women began to be looked 
at? Or was there something that had happened to our

37:27.082 --> 37:31.969
society that made us even... us academic dummies 
who had been brought up largely on new criticism

37:32.185 --> 37:43.400
made us realize that literature had something to 
do with the world in which we live.

37:46.965 --> 37:56.118
We have claimed too little for our field, but our 
claims, I think, have also been indiscriminate.

37:56.158 --> 38:01.585
And partly they've been indiscriminate because 
we were trying so hard to make things seem

38:02.172 --> 38:10.407
legitimate, academic, respectable, and working 
within the university environment. And

38:10.427 --> 38:13.994
remember, this was the university that came out of 
the 50s. This wasn't the university of the 1930s.

38:15.837 --> 38:25.395
This was the university that came out of the 50s, 
working within that very straight environment,

38:15.837 --> 38:25.395
trying to make people see that science fiction was 
so important. Well, we were guilty of a lot of

38:26.185 --> 38:45.299
things, of being very defensive, apologetic, 
trying to use the style of our colleagues and our

38:26.185 --> 38:45.299
professions, that obscurantist style, in order 
to make what we did seem to be just as legitimate as

38:26.185 --> 38:45.299
what the other people did, and so on. But we have 
won. There's no way that science fiction is going

38:50.975 --> 38:54.599
to be removed from the curriculum. It was 
wonderful news to hear the size of this

38:55.179 --> 39:05.970
organization, which has now grown to over 400 
dues-paying, card-carrying members. And I think

39:07.271 --> 39:19.243
it's very predictable that the organization is 
going to have a healthy future, that science

39:07.271 --> 39:19.243
fiction forces are going to continue to 
proliferate in the colleges as they have in the

39:07.271 --> 39:19.243
high schools. I'd go further, though. I say we've 
claimed too little. I think that science fiction

39:26.240 --> 39:39.981
courses may be, or to be more precise, could be the 
most important courses taught in literature

39:26.240 --> 39:39.981
departments. I would make that claim. I think that 
science fiction courses could be the most

39:44.367 --> 39:48.317
important courses taught in literature 
departments. And I would bet that probably most of

39:48.337 --> 39:59.406
us here who aren't academics secretly believe 
that, whether we admit it to our college

39:48.337 --> 39:59.406
colleagues or not.

40:02.643 --> 40:16.737
Because when you think about it, most of the 
supposedly great literature that we were trained

40:02.643 --> 40:16.737
in was about relatively trivial concerns 
compared to the concerns of science fiction. We

40:17.878 --> 40:20.000
get back to this word critical. The really 
critical questions, the crises of our age, what it

40:20.060 --> 40:31.772
is to be a human being in the waning years of the 20th 
century, what other literature really deals with

40:20.060 --> 40:31.772
this? Martellus.

40:36.899 --> 41:04.307
who also began a course in science fiction in that 
1961-1962 academic year, wrote an article in 1974

40:36.899 --> 41:04.307
in the College English Association chapbook 
called Science Fiction, The Academic Awakening,

40:36.899 --> 41:04.307
which I think was called The Science Fiction 
Course Reconsidered, or I'm sorry, Some Thoughts

40:36.899 --> 41:04.307
on the Course in Science Fiction, and he had 
written an earlier article. And in that, Marx said

41:05.401 --> 41:15.310
this,

41:05.401 --> 41:15.310
quote, I have a great sympathy for these 
traditional interests and hope that there will

41:15.577 --> 41:20.282
always be room for them in colleges and 
universities. Well, that in itself is a very

41:20.462 --> 41:24.046
interesting statement. You begin to say, well, 
maybe the shoe's on the other foot or something.

41:27.790 --> 41:43.187
And as most of us know, one of the reasons that 
science fiction courses do arouse considerable

41:27.790 --> 41:43.187
animosity among some of our, quote, colleagues is 
that their courses are there languishing with

41:27.790 --> 41:43.187
three or four students while We can't find rooms 
big enough to teach the science fiction course.

41:49.076 --> 42:03.257
There are other phenomena, too, that most of the 
traditional courses, the students who are in that

41:49.076 --> 42:03.257
course do not include any students except for some 
graduate students who really are readers of that

41:49.076 --> 42:03.257
literature. Whereas anyone who's ever taught 
science fiction knows you get a fair number of

42:03.277 --> 42:11.048
people in that class who are real readers of that, 
really read this stuff. Well, Marx said he has

42:11.585 --> 42:23.023
sympathy for these traditional interests, hope 
there'll always be room for them in the colleges

42:11.585 --> 42:23.023
and universities, and goes on, it would be a sad day 
for all of us if there were not. And frankly, I would

42:24.185 --> 42:34.461
hate to see Arthur Clarke replace John Milton, but 
we need not make this either-or kind of choice. He

42:35.583 --> 42:38.267
says, I would hate to see Arthur Clarke replace 
John Milton. and then he goes on what i'm expecting

42:38.635 --> 42:55.142
someday is a work of the magnitude of paradise lost 
which seen in the context of its time we could

42:38.635 --> 42:55.142
describe as at least akin to science fiction like 
paradise lost this major work of science fiction

42:56.540 --> 43:05.269
will present a coherent vision of the universe and 
man's place in it and the ultimate meaning of it

42:56.540 --> 43:05.269
all. Now, Mark Hillegas wouldn't want people 
reading Arthur C. Clarke in place of Milton. I

43:12.256 --> 43:15.940
don't really think that that's the adequate 
comparison. I don't really think that that's the

43:16.120 --> 43:19.723
choice, if there were a choice to be made. The 
comparison with Milton is all off stapleton.

43:24.974 --> 43:50.020
There is the imagination who took the latest 
scientific understanding of the cosmos in which

43:24.974 --> 43:50.020
we live at that time, and it hasn't been modified 
that all much since then, peopled this cosmos,

43:24.974 --> 43:50.020
took that cosmology and peopled it, tried to 
present an imaginative construction adequate to

43:50.860 --> 43:59.051
the scientific knowledge of the world in which we 
live. If we had to choose between Paradise Lost

44:00.252 --> 44:10.326
and, say, Star Maker, I wouldn't hesitate a 
second. I really wouldn't. If we had to choose,

44:13.410 --> 44:17.175
whatever the choice, I mean, it's a little 
hypothetical. How's the choice going to be? You

44:18.436 --> 44:19.618
have a desert island. We could do that one. It's 
kind of Sophie's choice. Which one of these books

44:28.887 --> 44:30.590
will we burn? I don't think it really counts. But if 
we had to choose, I don't know. I don't know what

44:36.120 --> 44:37.543
other people would. I wouldn't hesitate. I'd say 
Star Maker is something that's very important to

44:43.797 --> 44:46.463
us. Paradise Lost, much of its interest is now 
historical. Stapleton's cosmology conforms to

44:52.176 --> 45:02.700
modern science, but much more important than that 
is the relevance of Stapleton's vision to the

44:52.176 --> 45:02.700
crises.
