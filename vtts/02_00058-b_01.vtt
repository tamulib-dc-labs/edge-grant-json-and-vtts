WEBVTT

00:02.309 --> 00:05.974
We had very few scholarships available to award to Corps members.

00:07.376 --> 00:12.743
And they were awarded after school started, essentially, so they had nothing to do with recruiting people.

00:13.704 --> 00:20.313
The recruiting effort was very small, very unsophisticated, very low budget.

00:20.814 --> 00:22.035
No money, really, for that.

00:22.817 --> 00:31.388
But, you know, we kept getting 700, 800, 900 freshmen every year without it.

00:31.857 --> 00:34.239
this big recruiting effort.

00:34.259 --> 00:39.924
But all that changed shortly after I came here with enrollment management and the limit on the number of freshmen.

00:41.926 --> 00:44.989
It made us really get with it to recruit.

00:45.429 --> 00:55.839
And then Desert Storm came along and the Cold War ended, or the Cold War ended first, and then Desert Storm, all those had a big impact on the military, cutbacks 40%.

00:56.359 --> 01:01.864
They didn't need all these people that we'd been commissioning before, not that kind of number.

01:02.080 --> 01:11.033
So gradually people, I think, became less interested in military careers.

01:11.073 --> 01:12.395
The economy took off.

01:13.376 --> 01:18.804
What I'm saying, recruiting became a real critical issue.

01:20.287 --> 01:25.895
I started sensing this my first year here that we would have to do something with enrollment management coming.

01:25.935 --> 01:28.138
We would have to do something about recruiting.

01:28.878 --> 01:38.188
And in fact, I went to Dr. Vandiver in the spring of that year to ask for a recruiting officer position on the staff.

01:39.649 --> 01:42.712
And he quickly agreed that I could have one.

01:42.752 --> 01:44.394
We hired Mark Satterwhite.

01:44.534 --> 01:46.116
I don't know if you know Mark or not.

01:46.917 --> 01:49.059
Wife works over and worked for Gary Gaston.

01:49.079 --> 01:54.725
I think she's an assistant vice president now.

01:54.845 --> 01:56.927
But anyway, Mark came.

01:57.413 --> 01:59.215
and became our first recruiting officer.

01:59.235 --> 02:00.697
He was by himself doing recruiting.

02:00.717 --> 02:06.363
We talked about building some brochures and things, and we didn't have any funds to do that.

02:07.605 --> 02:10.969
We got this guy, Rod Dockery, who I had not met at that time.

02:11.009 --> 02:12.670
He agreed.

02:12.711 --> 02:19.138
He was very supportive of the Corps, and he agreed to publish all this stuff for free for us, which he did for a few years.

02:19.899 --> 02:25.345
But most of what we got in the recruiting area was gratis kind of things.

02:25.780 --> 02:28.963
But, you know, it's come from here to here.

02:29.043 --> 02:40.073
It's been on a steep increase, the effort, the resources that we have to do recruiting, and I can talk more about that.

02:40.253 --> 02:47.079
But I'll say that it's really increased and it's had to, and it's a struggle today to keep the numbers even flat.

02:48.160 --> 02:54.606
How long was it before you began to see some results of the recruiting?

02:58.501 --> 03:12.368
Well, I think we saw some payoff from this, but it's one of those things I don't know how you could really say, you know, it was a result of this.

03:12.428 --> 03:14.071
Advertising, how much does it help?

03:15.133 --> 03:19.682
You know, you have a feel for it, but I'm saying had we not been

03:20.843 --> 03:26.970
deeply committed to recruiting on an increasing plane, the Corps would have really declined on us.

03:27.030 --> 03:32.076
I think all the effort helped us stay fairly flat, but it did decline some.

03:32.977 --> 03:39.425
And 1993 led to the big blue ribbon committee that we had that met off and on all year.

03:40.547 --> 03:42.649
Recruiting was the

03:42.815 --> 03:43.637
main emphasis.

03:44.338 --> 03:48.508
What were the primary points in the advertising campaign?

03:49.851 --> 03:51.415
What were you all saying about?

03:51.735 --> 04:01.718
Leadership, character development, challenge, discipline, study time, mandatory study time,

04:02.272 --> 04:08.599
Academic support, counselors, tutors, I could go, we added all of these things downstream.

04:10.501 --> 04:19.311
Buck Henderson and I went over to Austin, way back there, when they first built their big athletic academic support complex over there.

04:19.911 --> 04:25.317
Must have been, oh, 1989 or 90, somewhere along in there.

04:26.819 --> 04:29.562
We'd heard that University of Texas

04:29.980 --> 04:32.804
develop this new academic support center for athletes.

04:33.806 --> 04:43.841
You get study facilities and computers and everybody helps you in all this.

04:43.941 --> 04:47.527
So I forget the fellow's name, the professor that ran that thing.

04:47.567 --> 04:49.570
And Buck and I went over there and spent a day with him.

04:49.650 --> 04:52.434
It was very eye-opening to me to see what they had.

04:53.776 --> 04:58.924
And I came back and I said, you know, we need something along this idea for the cadets.

04:59.461 --> 05:06.492
You know, if you're going to be in a core, we want you to do well, we want you to graduate, and we're going to offer you all the assistance we can to help you.

05:08.155 --> 05:10.078
And that was our thrust and goal.

05:11.300 --> 05:21.016
And, you know, we were able to do some of that, but some students take advantage of it, and some, in spite of all you offer them, still won't take it or they won't do that well.

05:21.978 --> 05:25.924
But nonetheless, the bottom line is recruiting was very meager.

05:26.343 --> 05:37.437
and quickly it became apparent that we had to get in high gear, and they're still looking today at what we can do better to recruit.

05:38.559 --> 05:41.723
But it's a tough environment today to recruit in.

05:41.783 --> 05:50.935
The propensity of young people to join the military is as low as it's been since the end of World War II, or before World War II, and there are a lot of reasons for that.

05:52.317 --> 05:53.278
Economy and

05:54.406 --> 06:01.378
It's been a big thing, but the military has downsized so sharply.

06:01.418 --> 06:11.956
I remember back in the, I believe it was in the mid-50s, there were 100,000 college students signed up for Air Force ROTC.

06:13.118 --> 06:16.483
I don't know what the number is today, but I'll bet you it's well below 10,000.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.430
It's just a fraction of what it was in those days.

06:21.035 --> 06:26.085
Let's talk about women and minorities in the Corps.

06:28.108 --> 06:31.134
Women, the number women began to grow, did it not?

06:33.819 --> 06:34.180
It did.

06:34.581 --> 06:38.368
It's been on an increase over the last,

06:39.226 --> 06:40.408
12 years, I know that.

06:40.428 --> 06:43.493
14 years, it's been on an increase.

06:43.513 --> 06:47.220
I think it was fairly flat back when I came here those years.

06:47.280 --> 06:51.326
I think I'd have to go back and check the numbers, but I'm guessing 50 or 60 something.

06:51.347 --> 06:55.193
We had two separate women units, one called

06:56.692 --> 07:01.920
W-2 or something as women-2 and the other was an Air Force unit.

07:01.960 --> 07:07.910
I forget the squadron they were, but we had two separate women female units.

07:07.930 --> 07:09.352
One Army and one Air Force.

07:09.372 --> 07:11.235
The Navy, Marine didn't have anybody.

07:11.696 --> 07:14.540
And they lived and operated as separate units?

07:14.560 --> 07:16.283
As separate units.

07:16.303 --> 07:20.590
How did that change in your 10 years?

07:21.076 --> 07:32.200
I came, having gone through a lot of changes in the Air Force involving women and other things, and I think I was,

07:33.901 --> 07:42.151
aware of what was going on, what I think was the military and the real world even, that things were changing.

07:43.493 --> 07:56.369
I remember in the Air Force back in 73, I guess it was, I was working in the Pentagon and somebody came in with a proposal there that would allow pregnant women to remain in the Air Force.

07:57.450 --> 07:59.192
It nearly knocked us out of our chairs.

07:59.552 --> 08:03.317
We thought that was the most radical thing we'd heard because up until that point,

08:03.652 --> 08:06.257
If you became pregnant, you were discharged.

08:06.918 --> 08:11.606
And there was no fault how we could keep women in the military that were pregnant.

08:11.626 --> 08:16.214
Well, you know, that all did change, and a lot of other things changed.

08:16.234 --> 08:27.313
I knew that the Air Force had been pretty active in integration, and I'd been to places and heard commanders speak and say where they had integrated...

08:27.800 --> 08:31.205
men and women together in the Air Force, the men performed better.

08:31.426 --> 08:32.387
It all worked.

08:32.447 --> 08:38.457
And even in dormitories or barracks buildings where they had some integration, it seemed to work better.

08:38.957 --> 08:43.885
And I saw a lot of examples of that in the military, so I was kind of tuned into that when I came here.

08:44.686 --> 08:51.597
And I didn't, all the other things going on, didn't have too much time to dwell on these separate women's unit.

08:52.488 --> 08:58.925
It didn't take too long to start getting feedback that suggested these women weren't too happy.

08:59.968 --> 09:01.873
They felt ridiculed.

09:02.512 --> 09:07.619
They'd tell me stories about how the guys would sing Jody's and make fun of them.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.023
They thought they were just playing core.

09:10.083 --> 09:13.528
The women were just pretending they weren't really physical enough.

09:13.548 --> 09:14.449
That's what the guys thought.

09:14.469 --> 09:17.073
That's what the guys, that's what the women tell me.

09:17.113 --> 09:21.819
That's what they got back from the guys.

09:22.540 --> 09:28.789
And it became a sore subject to them to be marching in a unit down here and these guys standing over here

09:29.512 --> 09:32.541
making crazy remarks and ridiculing them.

09:33.363 --> 09:37.776
And that started to build some resentment in my mind about all this.

09:37.796 --> 09:38.779
I didn't like that.

09:39.856 --> 09:44.360
And that first spring I was here, or was it the second?

09:44.961 --> 09:46.122
I guess it was the second spring.

09:46.882 --> 09:55.290
We had our military day, and we had all these visiting cadets here from the academies and a few other military schools, about 50 of them.

09:55.330 --> 09:57.732
And we had a parade over there on Simpson Field.

09:57.812 --> 10:03.177
The old Rickerley review stand was there, and we'd invite these visiting cadets to stand there on the review stand with me.

10:04.158 --> 10:07.981
And I was reviewing the troops, and they were all passing by, and the band was playing.

10:08.001 --> 10:09.863
And...

10:10.433 --> 10:12.837
These two women units come marching by.

10:13.919 --> 10:15.761
Just a small little unit of women.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.484
And everybody else is all male.

10:18.646 --> 10:22.813
And this strong, husky, good-looking Air Force cadet was standing there by me.

10:24.876 --> 10:26.018
And I never will forget this.

10:26.078 --> 10:32.468
He kind of turned to me and he said, Sir, I thought they'd done away with all that separate stuff like that.

10:35.312 --> 10:38.297
And, you know, that cut me, woke me up.

10:39.188 --> 10:44.574
I said, you're right, that's essentially gone in the military.

10:45.535 --> 10:47.837
He didn't know that at the Air Force Academy at that point.

10:49.278 --> 10:54.544
And I went back and I started thinking about that and I said, you know, it's time we move on.

10:55.805 --> 11:04.534
And I had gotten a, started getting calls from the Pentagon from senior officers up there saying, Tom, when are you all going to get out of the Stone Age down there?

11:04.714 --> 11:08.318
You know, this integration thing, you know, it's moved way on.

11:08.635 --> 11:11.819
You know, we want men to be able to work with women and vice versa.

11:11.839 --> 11:12.841
You know, we expect that.

11:12.981 --> 11:14.423
We're going to depend more on women.

11:15.625 --> 11:17.527
And so you need to do something down there.

11:19.510 --> 11:22.214
Well, you know, there wasn't one administration official here.

11:22.835 --> 11:32.088
President John Coles, nobody ever gave me any instructions about women or you ought to integrate or not one word was spoken.

11:33.169 --> 11:37.275
Until that kid told me, he said, sir, I thought that was a thing of the past.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.204
And I sat out on my own.

11:39.264 --> 11:41.466
I said, I'm going to do something about this.

11:42.487 --> 11:44.489
And I tried to develop a plan and all.

11:44.509 --> 11:56.599
And I remember writing a memo to John Colas saying, you know, we're starting our planning efforts to try integration in the Corps.

11:56.619 --> 11:58.521
And, you know, he just kind of acknowledged it.

11:58.561 --> 12:01.604
He didn't say, yeah, sure, go ahead and do that.

12:03.586 --> 12:05.147
Mobley would have been president by then.

12:05.187 --> 12:06.368
He didn't say anything.

12:07.698 --> 12:20.173
And I'd been an ex-officio member of the faculty senate for four years by virtue of my position as head of the School of Military Sciences.

12:20.693 --> 12:28.562
General Simpson had got it written in that that position would be an ex-officio member of the faculty senate back when it was organized.

12:29.484 --> 12:30.805
So I'd go to those meetings.

12:31.266 --> 12:36.692
And I started detecting some things from the faculty senate.

12:37.060 --> 12:39.644
You know, didn't seem very much in favor of the Corps.

12:39.664 --> 12:40.726
They didn't like a lot of things.

12:40.806 --> 12:44.733
I really need to talk about that a little bit more here at some point.

12:45.314 --> 12:57.955
But I could tell that although they never mentioned women to me per se, that they were kind of pushing some of those kind of issues.

12:58.930 --> 13:09.686
But when I did go ahead and integrate, I said, what we'll do is we're going to take the spring semester, and I want to find a unit that will be willing to try this.

13:10.848 --> 13:13.712
And I want to find some volunteer women that will go over there.

13:13.752 --> 13:19.060
We want to put at least eight of them in there so that there will be some in each class.

13:19.161 --> 13:23.487
So, you know, it's not just one over there, but you need at least eight, we determined.

13:23.753 --> 13:25.995
to go over there and be a part of this unit.

13:26.415 --> 13:33.682
I found one CO that came forward to me, Kyle Berry was his name, said, I'll be the CO, I'll be glad to try that in my unit.

13:34.202 --> 13:34.643
And he did.

13:34.663 --> 13:36.584
And it worked pretty well that spring.

13:36.625 --> 13:37.726
We didn't have any problems.

13:37.766 --> 13:38.967
Kind of surprised everybody.

13:39.407 --> 13:41.429
But again, I was just pushing all this on my own.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.491
Nobody was giving me any instruction.

13:44.452 --> 13:51.718
Then the next year, the faculty said it and others started picking up on this thing.

13:52.188 --> 13:54.352
And say, why don't you integrate the whole corps?

13:57.318 --> 14:01.806
You know, why don't you take those 50 women you got and scatter them around the whole corps?

14:02.588 --> 14:04.371
Well, we had 35 units.

14:05.313 --> 14:07.417
So it'd be about one per unit.

14:08.780 --> 14:10.102
And I don't think that'll work.

14:10.683 --> 14:14.230
You know, that's suicide for these women to put one per unit like that.

14:14.615 --> 14:20.744
So we had determined, based on what studies and all we'd done, we needed eight to integrate a unit.

14:20.764 --> 14:27.954
So the plan was we would try to spread this more each year, recruit more women, grow this thing.

14:28.696 --> 14:34.344
But what we ran into, most of the units didn't want to do it, and they're going to try to kill it any way they can.

14:34.624 --> 14:38.590
And there's still units over there that are holding out that don't want to do it.

14:39.011 --> 14:40.032
Not us.

14:40.383 --> 14:42.226
Okay for those, but not us.

14:43.048 --> 14:46.615
Who were your best allies in that effort?

14:47.917 --> 14:56.012
Are there some individuals that were good allies on supporting the core integration?

14:56.032 --> 15:00.180
Didn't have a lot of allies on that thing.

15:04.109 --> 15:11.960
At the very beginning, the Air Force guy that was the head of the Air Force ROTC, he strongly supported it.

15:12.641 --> 15:14.083
He was my strongest supporter.

15:14.324 --> 15:14.744
He helped.

15:15.365 --> 15:17.368
It was an Air Force unit that integrated.

15:22.155 --> 15:26.421
But board members or faculty senate or...

15:27.380 --> 15:30.324
Well, the faculty said it, it couldn't do it fast enough for them.

15:30.584 --> 15:32.807
That was the only problem there, couldn't do it fast enough.

15:32.947 --> 15:35.931
But you're implying that the board was very silent.

15:36.171 --> 15:37.953
Very silent, very silent.

15:38.554 --> 15:40.156
Did you hear from any former students?

15:40.857 --> 15:41.357
Oh, did I?

15:42.919 --> 15:43.320
Did I?

15:44.121 --> 15:48.546
And they were, they were mostly against it.

15:49.007 --> 15:52.611
What did the critics say was going to be the result?

15:53.603 --> 15:55.048
Well, it'll ruin the Corps.

15:55.510 --> 15:57.156
It'll drive these other folks off.

15:57.196 --> 16:00.067
They don't want to go join being a Corps with a bunch of women.

16:00.107 --> 16:03.460
It'll drag the men down, is what they say.

16:03.480 --> 16:04.423
It'll kill the spirit.

16:05.045 --> 16:07.828
It'll pull everybody down, you know, to their level.

16:08.329 --> 16:11.452
They didn't think physically they could do all the stuff they could do.

16:11.472 --> 16:16.818
We had a core development council meeting, I never will forget this, down in Houston.

16:17.739 --> 16:24.105
And this is after about the second year we're into this thing when it became beyond that little pilot unit we had.

16:24.126 --> 16:28.050
And a lot of the core development council members were just up in arms.

16:28.090 --> 16:30.192
They were writing letters to the president.

16:31.302 --> 16:32.444
All this stuff, Mobley.

16:32.484 --> 16:33.926
Mobley became a supporter.

16:34.086 --> 16:36.570
He became a strong supporter of it.

16:36.590 --> 16:40.495
But initially he was, you know, wasn't involved.

16:41.457 --> 16:44.081
But he became one of the strongest allies on that.

16:44.301 --> 16:48.387
How long did it take before people began to accept that it was working?

16:49.468 --> 16:50.610
Oh, a long time.

16:51.383 --> 16:58.232
I went to that Court Development Council meeting, I say, and I got up and gave my report, and golly, they nearly hooted me out of there.

16:59.194 --> 17:19.602
It was bad, but Dean Gage was interim at that time, and I remember he came to the meeting knowing that this was before, well, let's see, yeah, before, no, it was after Mobley, but he came to the meeting, well, I lose sight here of where I am, but I believe Gage came to the meeting,

17:20.223 --> 17:22.545
because he knew that I was going to be attacked there.

17:23.306 --> 17:27.030
Dean Gage was very supportive during his interim period, very supportive.

17:28.551 --> 17:32.776
But some of the old Corps guys just got up and gave me the devil.

17:34.577 --> 17:41.925
And, you know, I don't want those hides in the Corps, they would, terms like that, very derogatory kind of terms.

17:44.027 --> 17:49.032
Now did band co-education come during the same period or was it earlier?

17:49.889 --> 17:50.911
Yours in the band?

17:51.572 --> 17:53.015
The band had women.

17:53.435 --> 17:54.477
Okay, so that's earlier.

17:54.798 --> 17:56.661
Okay.

17:56.982 --> 18:01.049
The band had a few women, but I believe they still lived separately.

18:01.069 --> 18:03.133
They weren't integrated in the dorm.

18:03.874 --> 18:06.559
But the band accepted all that quite well.

18:06.940 --> 18:09.845
Ray Toler was band director.

18:09.965 --> 18:12.049
He was supportive, very supportive.

18:13.008 --> 18:16.636
What about race and ethnicity?

18:17.138 --> 18:21.508
Any particular events, efforts there?

18:22.049 --> 18:29.346
Well, you know, we started looking at numbers and it sort of became a,

18:30.406 --> 18:36.336
common goal around here to pursue minorities and we joined that effort.

18:37.017 --> 18:43.647
I used to look at minorities and we usually ran ahead of the rest of the university on total on a percentage of minority students.

18:45.530 --> 18:49.957
But I never saw any real problem with minorities.

18:49.977 --> 18:52.802
There'd been an isolated situation or two but

18:53.052 --> 19:02.147
The core, my experience says, is pretty accepting of people if they carry their weight, put out the effort and all.

19:03.789 --> 19:05.111
They're very accepting.

19:05.893 --> 19:10.420
And I try to tell people that my experience with...

19:11.564 --> 19:16.892
minority students here is if you are an Aggie, then you're accepted.

19:18.394 --> 19:23.521
Doesn't matter your skin color or where you're from or what your dad does or doesn't do.

19:24.282 --> 19:26.065
If you're part of the group, come on in.

19:27.507 --> 19:32.534
That women had a heck of a time when racial, I mean when coeducation began.

19:32.835 --> 19:36.340
Women had a heck of a time here, but there was never a problem

19:36.792 --> 19:39.595
for the first black students.

19:40.416 --> 19:51.288
And now one of the handicaps here is there is not a big black professional group of people living in the community.

19:51.749 --> 19:55.413
So it's hard to recruit white-collar black youngsters here.

19:55.433 --> 19:56.094
I totally agree.

19:56.474 --> 20:04.183
But I think generally the African Americans have had a pretty good shot in the Corps if they come in and put out the effort.

20:04.163 --> 20:07.287
and do the best they can.

20:07.307 --> 20:14.698
The Corps is very accepting if you do the best you can, but they're quick to recognize a gold brick or someone that's trying to goof off.

20:15.899 --> 20:29.158
Were there any key women and or black Corps members during your years that are appropriate to identify in the individuals and their role?

20:30.775 --> 20:45.628
I can think of one young lady, I can't recall her name right at the moment, I'd have to check it up, but... What did she do that was... She was a senior at the time, and 91 was the year that all...

20:46.132 --> 20:48.534
Things fell apart, broke loose it seemed.

20:48.574 --> 20:50.817
We had all kind of problems that year.

20:50.897 --> 21:01.788
Ninety-one was the year that the sexual harassment and discrimination thing became the big news in the Corps and we were making not only state but national news.

21:01.828 --> 21:06.472
It was discrimination and sexual harassment complaints and all of that.

21:07.513 --> 21:12.158
And I don't know that that had anything to do with the integration thing.

21:12.378 --> 21:15.261
I really don't think it did, but we had

21:15.545 --> 21:19.450
tremendous problems in 91, one of the toughest years I ever went through.

21:21.152 --> 21:40.235
Started off with this young member of the Parsons Mounted Cav, a female cadet, saying that she was a sophomore, saying that she'd been threatened with a knife out there in the parking lot by the security police, by the security office.

21:40.255 --> 21:42.818
It was in the afternoon and she filed

21:43.085 --> 21:53.259
you know, reported to the police and all that she had been threatened with a knife and told to get out of the calf, that she was not welcome there.

21:53.319 --> 21:57.505
And that's a pretty serious charge in someone.

21:58.166 --> 22:06.657
And she couldn't identify who the so-called attackers were, but, you know, she gave us some clue and all.

22:06.798 --> 22:11.404
It set off investigations that went on a long time, were very deep.

22:12.278 --> 22:18.624
resulted in 30-something disciplinary actions against members of Parsons Mounted Cav.

22:18.744 --> 22:24.970
I suspended the operation for several weeks that fall after this thing kicked off.

22:24.990 --> 22:31.977
What we found was discrimination against this young lady in the Parsons Mounted Cavalry.

22:33.118 --> 22:40.885
The jobs they assigned her to do, the way they treated her, that's pretty well documented.

22:42.029 --> 22:49.259
She, we never could pin down who threatened her if this case was true.

22:49.359 --> 22:57.431
She later recanted her story to Bob Wyatt in a sense, saying that it really didn't happen the way I first said.

22:57.471 --> 22:59.714
She didn't say something didn't happen.

23:00.275 --> 23:06.484
People generally concluded after it's all over, well, that little girl just lied about it.

23:06.584 --> 23:07.725
She recanted her story.

23:07.745 --> 23:10.990
There's not a single evidence, a bit of truth about this thing.

23:11.577 --> 23:14.761
the discrimination, the harassment was there.

23:15.582 --> 23:16.884
There's no question about that.

23:18.366 --> 23:23.593
And I had a lot of parents to deal with, lawyers to deal with.

23:27.218 --> 23:32.185
The one kid that was the strongest suspect, a good-looking kid,

23:32.671 --> 23:34.033
His parents came here.

23:34.093 --> 23:35.655
They got a lawyer in town.

23:35.736 --> 23:39.681
The lawyer came to see me, and I was so perturbed with him.

23:39.742 --> 23:43.447
I told him, I said, the student's wasting his money dealing with you.

23:44.749 --> 23:46.151
And he says, I'll show you.

23:46.211 --> 23:49.456
I'll get an injunction against you, which he did.

23:51.138 --> 23:57.007
He got an injunction to stop the action that I had pending against the student.

23:57.268 --> 23:57.548
Oh, my.

23:58.675 --> 24:06.588
The parents came to see me, the mother, and I talked with her and I told her that, you know, we're not there to hammer anyone.

24:06.628 --> 24:13.259
We want to get to the bottom of things and we cannot tolerate harassment and stuff like that.

24:13.339 --> 24:18.267
And I couldn't prove exactly what happened, but certain things I did know.

24:18.307 --> 24:23.856
And she ended up, they ended up terminating their job.

24:24.646 --> 24:35.402
deal with the lawyer, the injunction was lifted and we proceeded with the action and that lady's been very supportive and good terms since then.

24:35.482 --> 24:46.097
But a lot of tough dealings were that Parsons Mounted Cavalry thing and this little girl, this young woman I'll say.

24:46.533 --> 24:50.778
eventually left school, and it was a long, involved story.

24:51.419 --> 24:54.563
I'd go over and visit her in the dorm, and I couldn't get much from her.

24:54.683 --> 24:59.950
But the most complex case I've dealt with since I've been here.

25:00.891 --> 25:02.813
But it left a bad taste.

25:02.853 --> 25:08.721
But there was a young woman in the Corps that year that was a strong ally.

25:09.262 --> 25:13.587
And there were some other cases that year involving some women.

25:13.627 --> 25:16.050
Some of them had been...

25:16.807 --> 25:22.536
Hazed, harassed, one of them was out at the bonfire cut site.

25:24.278 --> 25:33.192
The CO decided that they all needed a lick on the bottom with a board out there, and he gave them all a lick.

25:34.594 --> 25:40.924
I think she claimed it stung pretty good, but that was just one of a number of things that she charged.

25:41.309 --> 25:45.698
the way she had been humiliated and discriminated against.

25:46.860 --> 25:52.492
It was a pretty strong case she had, but there were several of those cases.

25:52.572 --> 25:55.758
But this young woman, I thought, handled herself very well.

25:56.380 --> 26:03.013
Not that she put down those kind of things, but she was a positive example.

26:03.280 --> 26:19.242
and tried to argue that, you know, not everybody thinks that way, and I show you plenty of examples where people are mature about all this and know how to handle themselves, and it's good, and I've learned a lot as a woman in this cohort, and my life has improved a lot.

26:19.282 --> 26:22.266
And so she was a very positive model there.

26:23.147 --> 26:30.537
But when we were going through all that, I was still on the faculty senate, and they really took after my case.

26:32.440 --> 26:36.246
They thought integration was proceeding far too slowly.

26:38.249 --> 26:42.556
By the way, they did, I think, appreciate or not, that's not the right word.

26:42.576 --> 26:48.405
They did agree on my suspending the cavalry unit.

26:49.207 --> 26:51.851
When all this is going on, I said, there's too much going on here.

26:51.891 --> 26:52.492
You're done.

26:53.613 --> 26:59.663
You're going to cease and desist until we get this all sorted out and we get things reestablished the way they ought to be.

27:00.352 --> 27:02.856
And that was a painful exercise.

27:02.956 --> 27:09.786
And I took some flack, but you'd be surprised how many letters and phone calls I got from people saying, hey, boy, that was a good move.

27:09.807 --> 27:10.528
That was a good move.

27:10.548 --> 27:11.369
They deserved that.

27:12.110 --> 27:14.073
But we got it all put back together.

27:14.153 --> 27:23.187
But the Faculty Senate really jumped on integration about this time, like it was proceeding far too slowly.

27:24.128 --> 27:27.413
Are you meaning they're racial or?

27:28.134 --> 27:29.036
By women.

27:29.156 --> 27:32.681
The integration of women is proceeding far too slowly.

27:33.683 --> 27:39.672
And a lady by the name, Pat Alexander, from the English department, she later was speaker of the faculty senate.

27:39.692 --> 27:44.179
She was not then, but she was a very active person in the meetings.

27:44.412 --> 27:49.157
There were always a handful of people that spoke on every issue there at the faculty senate.

27:49.698 --> 27:51.921
I'd go to those long meetings and listen to all this.

27:51.941 --> 27:53.182
And it was an education to me.

27:53.202 --> 27:56.806
And I got to meet and learn a lot of people, something about them.

27:56.866 --> 27:59.449
And it was a good experience.

27:59.489 --> 28:02.453
But anyway, I knew her a little bit.

28:03.914 --> 28:14.166
But she got up and made a very emotional speech to the faculty senate one day that, you know, hell will freeze over before you get that core integrated the way you're going.

28:15.040 --> 28:19.746
And that really stuck my stone.

28:20.768 --> 28:29.500
During those years, did you get anonymous phone calls, hate mail unsigned, any of that?

28:30.101 --> 28:31.262
Some.

28:31.282 --> 28:35.668
Some of them didn't hesitate to sign and let you know, but some of it, yes.

28:36.049 --> 28:40.575
Did any legislator attempt to influence your judgment?

28:41.129 --> 28:42.091
Not that I remember.

28:43.756 --> 28:46.803
And the board took no action or anything?

28:47.385 --> 28:55.244
They seemed like I went over and maybe briefed them on a case or two, but I don't remember anything.

28:55.264 --> 28:58.733
I really pretty much left that one alone.

28:58.983 --> 29:14.407
All right, during those years of reality, on what kind of basis did you officially keep your administrative superiors aware?

29:14.908 --> 29:17.312
You reported to Colas and to

29:17.292 --> 29:21.298
the president, how often did you report to them by what was going on?

29:21.318 --> 29:24.824
Well, with John, it was a daily kind of thing.

29:25.165 --> 29:28.991
You know, we didn't have email in all those, so you had to send copies of things or call them.

29:29.692 --> 29:36.643
We had a thing called an incident report, and we'd fill those out overnight, and sometimes it'd have a stack of them.

29:36.683 --> 29:38.085
They amounted...

29:38.065 --> 29:42.571
from little piddly things to something pretty significant sometimes.

29:42.631 --> 29:49.240
But we had an incident form, and anything of any significance, we sent it over to John.

29:49.260 --> 30:00.055
If necessary, I'd call him direct, and he was always very willing to hear me out and wanted to know, and there was never any problem.

30:01.437 --> 30:02.959
Sometimes it's a question

30:03.462 --> 30:07.769
You know, what does he really, do you really need to, does he need to know this one or not?

30:07.809 --> 30:13.999
You can't bother him with everything, but, you know, after a while you learn which ones are there.

30:14.379 --> 30:19.227
A good example that when it didn't work.

30:20.371 --> 30:26.378
Of course, I depended on my staff to let me know when something went wrong that I needed to report.

30:26.478 --> 30:35.788
I briefed many times at staff meetings and others, you know, be sure, don't hesitate to call me at 2 o'clock in the morning if there's an incident.

30:38.191 --> 30:45.619
Well, this one morning I came to work at 7.30 and hadn't been there long until I got a phone, I believe it was from

30:47.472 --> 30:50.615
I guess it was from John, John or Malam, John, I'm sure.

30:51.816 --> 30:56.782
But he said something about, what about this shooting incident over in the dorm last night?

30:58.603 --> 31:00.025
I said, I don't know what you're talking about.

31:00.045 --> 31:11.877
He said, well, we just got a report here that there was a shooting or near shooting incident last night over in the dorm that this guy broke into this girl's room.
