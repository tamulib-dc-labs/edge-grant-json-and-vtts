WEBVTT

00:09.177 --> 00:14.223
The format is that you're going to ask me questions 
and I'll go on talking as long as I think it

00:09.177 --> 00:14.223
worthwhile. That's right. And if you think I've 
said too much, just stop me. And if you think I'm

00:17.007 --> 00:20.371
missing anything in asking questions, just 
interject something. Yes, sure. OK. All right.

00:23.655 --> 00:30.644
Now, was the study of geophysics accidental due to 
a need for a job in the Depression or a long-time

00:23.655 --> 00:30.644
interest of yours? I started life as a physicist in 
Cambridge. and I did the ordinary undergraduate

00:37.966 --> 00:44.035
course in physics, and I was determined to be a 
physicist. And this was an ambition which I'd had

00:44.055 --> 00:52.408
since I was first a teenager, since the age of 12 or 
14. I think it first started probably earlier than

00:53.009 --> 00:55.633
that. I thought I'd be an engineer, and then I 
learned what the world was like, and I decided to be

00:56.154 --> 01:01.462
a physicist. And I was, from the first really, a 
serious professional physicist. in the

01:07.210 --> 01:10.654
Cambridge tradition of experimental physics. 
And then I started to do research in 1929, which is

01:11.415 --> 01:21.228
not the best time in the world to start. I started on 
a PhD and I was going along and I was working on the

01:21.268 --> 01:28.417
scattering of electrons in gases. That's quite 
irrelevant to your topic, but this came out very

01:29.399 --> 01:35.867
well and rather quickly.

01:37.315 --> 01:42.661
Things were going well, Rutherford seemed 
pleased, he wasn't frightfully interested in

01:37.315 --> 01:42.661
this particular project. My supervisor was 
Patrick Blackett,

01:43.102 --> 01:50.550
who comes in later in the story again. And then one 
day I was having tea in the Cavendish, and a man came

01:50.610 --> 02:02.043
up to me and said, do you want a job in Geodesy? And I 
said, I think I probably do, what's Geodesy? This

02:06.475 --> 02:12.824
was Norman Feather, I think, who was recently 
retired as professor of physics in Edinburgh. A

02:12.844 --> 02:16.549
very bright young man who never really came to all 
that. Well, anyway, he'd been offered the job and

02:17.330 --> 02:21.295
he decided he didn't want it. And I went to see 
Rutherford. And Rutherford said, look, there are

02:24.700 --> 02:29.086
an awful lot of people just in front of you. And I 
think, and there are no jobs at all. If I were you,

02:33.171 --> 02:35.875
I'd take any job I could get. And so I went off and saw 
the man who was teaching surveying actually, a man

02:36.462 --> 02:44.953
called Sir Gerald Lance Cunningham. He had been in 
the British Army in India as a surveyor. He'd spent

02:50.159 --> 02:59.871
his life, he was a man then, I forget how old he was, I 
wrote a biography of him actually, and he was

02:50.159 --> 02:59.871
probably sixty. He'd been a surveyor in India and 
then come back to Cambridge to teach surveying. I

03:05.845 --> 03:12.632
think I needn't go into this because, as I say, I've 
written a biography of him in the Royal Society's

03:05.845 --> 03:12.632
biographical notices. And he seemed a rather nice 
sort of man, quite uninstructed, obviously

03:13.673 --> 03:20.079
didn't know anything about anything. He was a 
soldier and so on. Ended up as a colonel, I think,

03:22.341 --> 03:26.685
which isn't a very elevated rank. I thought I'd 
give it a try. So I took this job, and I dickered with

03:28.982 --> 03:37.035
him a bit, and I got him to pay me 350 pounds a year, 
which was very good pay in those days. I've never

03:37.155 --> 03:41.522
felt so well off as I did in this job. I had 350 as a 
salary, I had 150 by miscellaneous coaching and

03:41.762 --> 03:51.677
teaching and helping in labs and things. And I had 
about 100 pounds of my own, and I had something like

03:51.961 --> 03:56.705
600 pounds altogether. And I've never been so well 
off. We had help in the house. We had everything. We

04:01.029 --> 04:07.115
went skiing in the winter in Switzerland, and we 
went to Austria in the summer. And I got married,

04:07.135 --> 04:09.737
and everything was fine. And if you work it out with 
the inflation and the changes in taxes and so on,

04:10.558 --> 04:19.926
you'll find I was, in fact, better off than I've 
ever been since, until I came here. Anyway, I took

04:21.323 --> 04:24.266
this job, and a day or two later, I met Rutherford. 
Rutherford, of course, was the great father

04:24.286 --> 04:31.672
figure of physics at this time, a man with a 
wonderful instinct. Someone said of him, the

04:31.732 --> 04:34.995
alpha particles were his friends. He knew what 
they'd do. Well, he met me in the street, and he

04:36.857 --> 04:40.019
said, how are you getting on? I said, all right. He 
said, well, but how are you getting on with this man

04:41.741 --> 04:45.064
that's cunning him? And I said, I'm getting on very 
well. He's a nice man. He said, yes. I know he's a

04:50.197 --> 04:51.359
nice man. He's not very inspiring, is he? And I 
said, no, you couldn't call him that. He said,

04:56.705 --> 04:58.348
well, never your mind. If you want anything, just 
come and see me. He knew his, he was a modest man in a

05:00.530 --> 05:06.478
way, but he knew his position in the scheme of 
things. Well, anyway, that's how I got out of

05:07.119 --> 05:11.525
physics and into geophysics. And there was no 
money at all. In one year during this period, our

05:13.347 --> 05:17.993
department had no money other than they could pay 
my salary. Lennox Cunningham they didn't pay, he

05:18.277 --> 05:24.286
was paid by Trinity College and we had no money at 
all. And I went out and got contracts to do things

05:24.886 --> 05:32.958
for various firms and we got along and started 
serious work. And looking back I'm surprised how

05:34.180 --> 05:45.436
much we got done between 1931 when I joined this 
enterprise and 1939 when war broke out. That was

05:45.676 --> 05:47.018
eight years. And we started off, of necessity, 
doing what we were able to do, what we had equipment

05:47.200 --> 05:56.215
for. Ernest Cunningham had designed and 
constructed a pendulum apparatus for measuring

05:56.235 --> 06:03.808
gravity. And I took this up and the first thing I did 
was to make the thing work. He'd never succeeded in

06:08.188 --> 06:10.471
getting it to work. And so we got the thing to work. 
And essentially my PhD thesis was in two halves.

06:15.959 --> 06:20.045
The first half was on the scattering of solar 
electrons and gases. Looking back, I was reading

06:20.786 --> 06:25.172
it the other day and I thought it was an admirable 
thesis. about a topic which was very important at

06:25.574 --> 06:31.863
the time. Quantum mechanics was essentially 
invented in the middle 20s and I started on this

06:31.983 --> 06:49.468
work in 29 and we showed that quantum mechanics 
could account for the processes of scattering and

06:31.983 --> 06:49.468
this was one of the things that the old quantum 
theory of Bohr couldn't do. So very early on I got

06:53.654 --> 06:58.081
serious scientific results and a little bit of a 
reputation. Well, then the second half of the

06:58.101 --> 07:03.188
thesis consisted of an account of how to measure 
gravity with pendulums. And in between, there was

07:03.869 --> 07:07.635
a piece on the theory of the scattering of 
neutrons. I suddenly became interested in

07:07.735 --> 07:10.839
quantum mechanical scattering theory. And then 
there was an appendix on a machine for solving

07:11.520 --> 07:15.025
differential equations. Well, if never, no 
university in the world would accept a thesis

07:15.546 --> 07:21.535
today with a sort of ragbag of things. My examiners 
were Chadwick, the discoverer of the neutron, and

07:22.055 --> 07:30.107
Patrick Blackett, who was my supervisor. Look, 
I'm going into much too much detail of the part

07:30.287 --> 07:35.335
before I became an oceanographer. No, but no. Do 
you like this? Yes, I have all kinds of questions

07:36.997 --> 07:40.943
here to ask you about this that you're just 
answering as you go along. As you can see, I'm

07:40.983 --> 07:43.106
marking them off. Shall I go on like this? You bet. 
Well, I remember the Ph.D., oral very well. In

07:51.295 --> 07:55.520
Cambridge, just the two examiners and the 
candidate go to the oral. And I went in, and the

07:55.540 --> 08:00.766
first thing Chandwick said was, you see that thing 
over by the door? What is it? And I said, well, I

08:02.168 --> 08:02.989
don't know. It's kept that door open ever since I 
can remember. It was a big lump, some big lump of

08:05.792 --> 08:10.418
iron, some sort of machine. Oh, he said, you won't 
know what that is. That's the machine which

08:13.081 --> 08:18.387
Wollaston made in 1812 for making Wollaston wire. 
Whether it was true or not, I don't know how he knew.

08:21.629 --> 08:25.453
And then Blackett said, do you read the Times this 
morning? And I said no. And he said, well, there's a

08:28.716 --> 08:33.100
letter in it about the distances of stars. How do 
you find the distances of stars? And it still

08:35.842 --> 08:37.023
happens. I talked about this, so I've stopped. And 
in all these sorts of examination interviews for

08:40.126 --> 08:48.373
jobs and things, I always believe in going on 
talking until someone stops you. Because as long

08:48.742 --> 08:54.388
as they listen to you, and they're talking about 
something you know about, obviously you're doing

08:48.742 --> 08:54.388
all right. And you reduce the time they've got to 
ask you questions you don't know about. Well, then

08:59.272 --> 09:02.896
Blackett said, what good do you think your work is? 
And I talked about that, and that was the end of my

09:03.677 --> 09:08.382
PhD all. So this was very satisfactory. Well then, 
I started to branch out a bit. We got some money, and

09:15.248 --> 09:17.871
I went to East Africa. with my wife and travelled 
all over the places you couldn't go now, all over

09:18.644 --> 09:44.652
Kenya and Uganda, south part of the Sudan, round 
into the Ture Forest in the Congo, down to the west

09:18.644 --> 09:44.652
of Rwenzori, back into Uganda and through Uganda 
again and Kenya and down into Tanzania and down to

09:18.644 --> 09:44.652
the coast and then up the coast to Malindi. 
measuring gravity a great adventure one of the

09:44.935 --> 10:13.710
sort of formative things in my life that first gave 
me the idea that I could do what I wanted to do and all

09:44.935 --> 10:13.710
this time I was getting rather dubious telegrams 
and letters from Dennis Cunningham who had

09:44.935 --> 10:13.710
various objections to the way the work was being 
done it involved him doing something in Cambridge

09:44.935 --> 10:13.710
making some measurements in Cambridge and me 
making measurements in Africa and he became sort

10:13.960 --> 10:17.584
of disenchanted with the project, didn't believe 
it was going to work out. But I was pretty sure it was

10:17.704 --> 10:19.366
all right. And when I got back, it was all right. And 
then someone told me that when you're a young man,

10:21.468 --> 10:26.975
you should write a very long paper. Because then, 
no one will read it, but whatever you do

10:26.995 --> 10:33.842
afterwards, people will say, very sound man, you 
know, he wrote that long paper. So I settled down,

10:33.862 --> 10:41.571
and I wrote the longest paper that had been 
published in the Philosophical Transactions of

10:33.862 --> 10:41.571
the Royal Society in this century. And it stayed 
the longest until after the war when there was a

10:42.142 --> 10:50.834
friend of mine who wrote a paper on the internal 
ballistics of rockets that was longer. So that I

10:50.854 --> 11:04.572
then become, this is the prestigious journal in 
England, rather stuffy, large sized pages, and

10:50.854 --> 11:04.572
this had coloured maps everywhere.

11:07.201 --> 11:20.195
I was a slightly erratic character who might well 
be accused of getting things wrong and rushing

11:07.201 --> 11:20.195
into print and so on, but the best thing to do was to 
have something at any rate people would say, yes

11:07.201 --> 11:20.195
this was a sound piece of work. Well then I felt we 
had to branch out and I took up seismic work on land.

11:27.422 --> 11:34.710
This was the time when seismology with explosions 
was just coming And it was something of a mystery.

11:39.163 --> 11:43.633
The oil industry weren't saying very much, and in 
fact, weren't doing it very well. And we started

11:44.435 --> 11:47.282
from scratch. With a number of graduate students, 
I mean usually only one at a time, because I never

11:47.988 --> 12:01.862
had more than one graduate student at a time at this 
time, through a number of years, four or five

11:47.988 --> 12:01.862
years, we worked on the depth of the old rocks under 
East England. In East England you've got old rocks

12:01.882 --> 12:14.535
a few hundred feet down, a thousand feet down, 
overlaid by clays and chalk and such things, and we

12:01.882 --> 12:14.535
were mapping this old land surface now bedded 
under East England. It was, we bit off more than we

12:15.157 --> 12:21.529
could chew, rather, but we couldn't quite 
acknowledge that, and we kept at it. And I really

12:21.589 --> 12:28.082
learned about seismology because, as I say, we 
were starting more or less from scratch. We wrote

12:28.222 --> 12:30.326
another very large paper on this. And then, at the, 
you, what would you take me? Sir? Do you want to put a

12:39.099 --> 12:40.220
new tape in? No, no. Well, at the International 
Union of Geologists and Geophysics in Edinburgh

12:41.140 --> 12:54.753
in 1936, this was about five years after I started 
in geophysics, I met Dick Field. Dick Field is one

12:55.634 --> 13:01.159
of the most influential geologists of the 
century. He was at Princeton. He never did very

13:03.141 --> 13:05.823
much scientific work, really. He never published 
very many papers. He was a curious man, extremely

13:08.583 --> 13:15.953
eccentric, extremely uninhibited. He was the 
most frightful nuisance. He wouldn't stop

13:18.537 --> 13:19.818
talking. He wouldn't take no for an answer. He went 
on and on. And he started going on and on about the

13:24.004 --> 13:32.596
importance of doing something about the geology 
of the oceans. Well, we were already doing

13:33.677 --> 13:38.083
something about gravity measurement at sea. 
There was a man called Vaning Minus, a wonderful

13:38.637 --> 13:49.495
man at Dutchman, who devised a method of using 
pendulums in a submarine for measuring gravity at

13:38.637 --> 13:49.495
sea. And Minus had come over, and we'd made 
arrangements to borrow his apparatus. And a

13:54.283 --> 13:56.967
colleague of mine, a young man, had joined us. He 
wasn't a graduate student because he didn't think

13:57.301 --> 14:03.249
it suitable for a gentleman to take a PhD. There was 
a strong feeling at that time in Cambridge that a

14:03.329 --> 14:08.556
gentleman didn't take a PhD. In fact, you don't 
want the history of the PhD in Cambridge. It's a

14:12.522 --> 14:13.663
very curious story. Yes. As a matter of fact, I was 
going to ask you what was life like as a student at

14:14.244 --> 14:18.350
Cambridge 45 years ago. Well, let me tell you about 
that.

14:24.976 --> 14:34.349
The PhD, of course, was invented in Germany as a 
second degree, after you got your first degree.

14:35.170 --> 14:36.752
And they didn't have one in Cambridge. But a 
considerable number of people started to come

14:37.774 --> 14:47.507
from various countries in the empire, 
particularly Canada, Australia, New Zealand, to

14:37.774 --> 14:47.507
turn up in Cambridge. And it was obviously 
desirable that they should have something to show

14:48.736 --> 14:53.984
for it, some certificate or other. So they took up 
the German idea of having a PhD, and four, these

14:54.705 --> 15:03.198
people with a Cambridge degree were not eligible. 
The argument was that if you had a Cambridge BA, why

15:03.218 --> 15:06.824
should you want a PhD? And after all, you'd get an MA 
by paying five pounds. In Cambridge, if you have a

15:10.387 --> 15:16.233
BA, after three years, you can pay five pounds and 
get an MA. And you don't have to stay in Cambridge.

15:18.154 --> 15:24.180
You can go away and get a job somewhere and just send 
in your five pounds and you get your MA. And as far as

15:24.200 --> 15:25.681
I know, that's all so. Well, anyway, so there was a 
PhD for people from abroad. And Rutherford was the

15:31.227 --> 15:35.170
first man to get it in, I think, 1896 or 
thereabouts. So they started with a bank. And this

15:38.703 --> 15:41.306
became a very popular thing. And after the war, 
there was a feeling that people from Cambridge

15:42.647 --> 15:49.555
should also be able to take it. And in fact, 
Chadwick was persuaded to take it to give some

15:50.376 --> 15:55.882
prestige to the degree. Chadwick came to 
Cambridge just after the war. He had, I think, a

16:01.388 --> 16:03.571
Cambridge degree already. He'd been imprisoned 
in Germany during the war. He was a He was in

16:07.913 --> 16:19.469
Germany, having just taken his degree before the 
war, and was shut up in Ruhleben, I think it was, a

16:07.913 --> 16:19.469
camp he was interned in Ruhleben. And he met there a 
number of other people, including Charlie Ellis,

16:20.410 --> 16:27.280
who became a famous physicist in Cambridge. And 
Shantwick ran a course in physics in this Ruhleben

16:27.360 --> 16:31.626
camp. the wall. After the war he came back and he was 
asked if he would take the PhD in order to give some

16:33.192 --> 16:42.327
prestige to it from the point of view of Englishmen 
taking it. Well right up to the middle 30s there was

16:42.948 --> 16:54.167
quite a strong feeling that it was slightly not the 
thing for a man with a Cambridge degree to take a

16:42.948 --> 16:54.167
PhD. Blackett never took a PhD. This man, BC Brown, 
who took up gravity measuring in submarines,

16:56.885 --> 17:01.911
never took a PhD. A number of people didn't. I went 
against this. I said, I am going to have all the

17:05.596 --> 17:12.184
qualifications I can get, because I don't know 
what's going to happen in the future. And I may need

17:12.785 --> 17:16.189
them for some reason, and they can't do me any harm. 
After all, I don't have to call myself Dr. Bullard.

17:18.992 --> 17:21.776
I can just keep it in the background. Well, anyway, 
if you asked me just now, say something about what

17:25.454 --> 17:29.423
it was like to be a student in Cambridge. Well, so I 
should go back, I think, to my first arrival in

17:30.065 --> 17:35.638
Cambridge. You'll find some account of this in 
that piece I wrote about Rutherford. which I gave

17:40.034 --> 17:40.975
you. I wrote in Nature last year a piece about 
Rutherford's Cambridge. I was asked to write a

17:46.041 --> 17:48.163
light-hearted piece. Nature has one issue a year 
which isn't so serious-minded at the time of the

17:48.924 --> 17:58.735
British Association for the Advancement of 
Science, and I wrote a piece about the Cavendish.

17:59.536 --> 18:02.059
Well, in Cambridge, you had to take four 
scientific subjects for your first two years. And

18:07.409 --> 18:14.077
I took physics, maths, mineralogy, and 
chemistry. And so I was only giving a rather small

18:14.097 --> 18:17.602
part of my time to physics. And these first two 
years were something of a disappointment. The

18:22.087 --> 18:25.211
lectures were moderately good. People were 
obviously preoccupied with their own research

18:26.693 --> 18:32.080
and so on, and they were a little superficial. And I 
remember in my third year coming out of a lecture by

18:32.617 --> 18:41.425
Aston, the inventor of the mass spectrograph. He 
was lecturing on mass spectroscopy. And I met

18:43.167 --> 18:44.708
Blackett in the corridor. He's a man 10 years older 
than me, already a very distinguished physicist.

18:49.333 --> 18:50.294
He said, what are you doing? I said, I've been 
listening to old Aston. He said, well, Aston, you

18:53.156 --> 18:54.378
do that for us. It's all in his book. And suddenly it 
came to me with a blinding flash that this was true

18:56.099 --> 19:00.143
of all the lecturers. So I stopped going to 
lectures altogether in my third year. There was no

19:03.285 --> 19:04.747
compulsion to go. And the examinations were not on 
the lectures. The examinations were on physics

19:09.052 --> 19:16.780
and were set largely by people from outside 
Cambridge, so they had no necessary relation to

19:09.052 --> 19:16.780
the lectures. So there was no great advantage in 
going to the lectures. So I continued to go to

19:23.849 --> 19:26.133
Rutherford's lectures, of course they were fun. 
You never knew what he'd say next. He had this

19:27.835 --> 19:36.809
wonderful intuitive understanding of physics 
and this pose of not knowing anything about

19:27.835 --> 19:36.809
theoretical physics. In fact, although he wasn't 
a mathematician, he was rather shrewd about

19:36.909 --> 19:49.068
physics and he had this wonderful intuition of how 
things would work and he'd say the most outrageous

19:36.909 --> 19:49.068
things. I think probably intentionally. I 
remember once him saying, integral y dx, dx is

19:51.853 --> 19:58.873
small, we'll ignore this, that kind of thing. And 
somehow or other the answer always came out right

19:59.073 --> 20:03.125
in the end. There's a story that In one of his early 
papers, I don't know if this is true, he was

20:05.918 --> 20:14.826
measuring the charge on the alpha particle, and it 
came out as 3.4. And he said, we'll take the nearest

20:15.006 --> 20:26.177
integer, which is 4, because he knew by some 
obscure internal intuition that this was the

20:15.006 --> 20:26.177
right answer. Well, anyway, he was the most 
wonderful man, and I got to know him when I started

20:27.718 --> 20:35.065
to do research. He was a predictable man in some 
cases. Sometimes he'd come in and he'd be as nice as

20:40.767 --> 20:48.857
anything, and then suddenly when he'd come in in a 
bad temper, he'd have to work it off from the first

20:40.767 --> 20:48.857
man he met. There was a man called Roberts, who was I 
suppose ten years older than me, working in the

20:49.698 --> 21:01.272
same room, and he came in one day, apparently very 
good humour, rubbing his hands, and said, The time

21:01.606 --> 21:06.272
has come to consider whether your experiments are 
worth the liquid air they consume. And Paul

21:07.634 --> 21:15.204
Roberts, who was a shy and retiring man with an 
enormous admiration of Rutherford, was

21:07.634 --> 21:15.204
absolutely shattered by this. Another day, he 
came in, and I had asked the head lab man to move an

21:16.165 --> 21:27.040
induction heater downstairs because I wanted to 
use it. And the lab man had complained to

21:27.543 --> 21:32.507
Rutherford that people were wanting this thing 
moved up and down stairs. Rutherford, as his usual

21:32.791 --> 21:46.106
way, he didn't put up a notice or anything, he just 
came around and attacked some individual, which

21:32.791 --> 21:46.106
is a very effective way, you see, of preventing 
people doing things. He started talking to me

21:46.947 --> 21:57.739
about it, and he worked himself up gradually by 
saying when he was young there hadn't been such

21:46.947 --> 21:57.739
things and no one used them, and so on and so forth. 
And finally he said, I never want to see you in the

21:57.779 --> 22:00.402
lab again. Which is a little high, I thought, on a 
graduate student in his second year. So Oliphant

22:04.815 --> 22:13.864
came to defend me, and Oliphant got told off for 
some quite other thing. And then he went round and

22:13.884 --> 22:20.470
he found Cockroft, the inventor of artificial 
disintegration, who designed the machine. He

22:20.490 --> 22:25.155
told him off for not making it in two parts, that it 
would be carried downstairs. And that evening I

22:25.796 --> 22:30.220
heard he was dining in Trinity, and He met the man, 
or he thought he'd met the man, who invented

22:30.858 --> 22:38.367
induction heaters from General Electric. And he 
said to him, he said, do you let your young men have

22:38.988 --> 22:43.834
these machines carried up and downstairs all the 
time? And the other man said, no, we have one on each

22:44.835 --> 22:48.679
floor. Well, anyway, I arranged next morning to 
get in a little early, because Motherford always

22:49.400 --> 22:55.988
arrived on the dot of nine. And I met him at the door 
and walked upstairs with him. And there must have

22:59.887 --> 23:07.138
been some feeling that he'd said something 
unsuitable because he was so nice to me and, you

22:59.887 --> 23:07.138
know, really friendly. And it was really the first 
time I really got to know him. I mean, I was entirely

23:09.902 --> 23:16.853
aware that he didn't really intend to throw me out 
of the room. It was a very curious set-up. There was

23:18.395 --> 23:20.138
no equipment at all, practically. You made 
everything yourself. You did your own

23:21.439 --> 23:22.681
glassblowing. Great difficulty in getting any 
kind of equipment. Rutherford was a farmer's boy.

23:30.969 --> 23:35.596
At least, he was a farmer's boy, a small farm in New 
Zealand. And he regarded himself as a farmer's boy

23:35.616 --> 23:42.025
who had somehow fallen into a corrupt society. And 
this gave him the right to be rude to people. He was

23:45.489 --> 23:48.714
really extraordinarily rude to a great number of 
people. But no one minded. He sort of went booming

23:50.757 --> 23:52.219
on. And obviously, he didn't feel he was being 
rude. One day, the master of Corpus Christi

23:55.958 --> 24:08.293
College, which was across a little alleyway from 
the lab, complained about the noise that was being

23:55.958 --> 24:08.293
made in the lab by a piece of equipment. And 
Rutherford was telling this story. He said, I told

24:11.296 --> 24:16.142
him if he didn't like the noise, he shouldn't have 
built the college there. The college, of course,

24:16.162 --> 24:20.127
was built in the 15th century or something, this 
guy. Well, the kind of atmosphere was this rather

24:20.866 --> 24:33.521
tough atmosphere, tremendously competitive, of 
course, because this was clearly the best school

24:20.866 --> 24:33.521
of physics in the world. This was the great centre 
of physics, where nuclear physics was invented.

24:42.511 --> 24:47.937
So the result was you got tremendously bright 
students, And the tremendously competitive

24:48.170 --> 24:53.095
atmosphere, very few jobs about. I remember Lord 
Bowden telling me, who was principal of the

24:53.215 --> 24:58.540
Manchester College of Technology. He was made a 
lord for some obscure reason by Mr. Wilson, who I

24:58.560 --> 25:05.507
suppose threw him out. Mr. Wilson used to make 
people lords either when he owed them money or when

25:05.527 --> 25:14.076
he threw them out of his government. Anyway, Bogle 
said, you know, it took me years to realise that the

25:14.748 --> 25:26.830
fact I wasn't as bright as these people didn't mean 
I had a low IQ, that this was a selective group.

25:26.850 --> 25:30.597
Well, anyway, I got out of this And everyone 
sympathized with me. People came around and said,

25:32.894 --> 25:37.759
well, a terrible thing that you have to leave 
physics and go into this backwater. And it's one of

25:38.460 --> 25:50.312
the curious and critical things in my life that I 
did get out of this intensely competitive atomic

25:38.460 --> 25:50.312
physics, nuclear physics that was just growing. I 
thought of it as a disaster at the time. But at the

25:53.295 --> 26:00.702
same time, I knew I was moving into something that 
might well suit me better. I described this, I

26:01.205 --> 26:07.454
think, in the Ewing piece, the piece I wrote about 
Ewing. I think I was really writing about myself.

26:11.860 --> 26:12.961
It was in a speech. It's not in, I think, in the 
biography of Ewing. I wrote it in a speech I gave in

26:16.806 --> 26:27.361
New York, which will be published in a while, when I 
said that it was not the obvious thing to get out of

26:16.806 --> 26:27.361
being a physicist. Ewing was also a physicist. get 
out of being a physicist and go into a sideline of

26:30.449 --> 26:40.903
this sort, and particularly Earth Sciences was at 
a very low ebb. The Earth Sciences had got

26:41.784 --> 26:45.368
themselves into a rut. The essential trouble was 
that they had no global theories. The global

26:53.860 --> 26:59.006
theories they had clearly didn't work and they'd 
become disreputable. If you talk to any geologist

27:01.195 --> 27:14.915
about how things worked, what the mechanisms of 
mountain formation were, what the driving forces

27:01.195 --> 27:14.915
of geology were, they would be quite uninterested 
and hostile. Because all efforts at explanation

27:14.955 --> 27:27.473
had not got anywhere, and they'd come to believe 
that the progress of the science was in going to a

27:14.955 --> 27:27.473
smaller and smaller scale, You got a PhD by 
examining a few square miles of whales or

27:28.364 --> 27:35.012
something of this sort. And this had become so dull 
that they weren't getting bright people. And the

27:40.018 --> 27:41.780
subject was slowly dying. And what happened to 
both Ewing and myself was that we were driven

27:43.161 --> 27:56.717
largely by economic necessity. And partly my 
emotional feelings, I think that something a

27:57.052 --> 28:12.917
little in the open air, something a little more 
large scale, a little more connected with human

27:57.052 --> 28:12.917
interests than nuclear physics, was maybe our 
thing. I mean, I wouldn't have voluntarily have

28:13.387 --> 28:22.178
left physics, I don't think, but I had an idea that 
maybe I'd have fun with it, with the different

28:13.387 --> 28:22.178
things. And also, of course, there's something to 
be said for being a large fish in a small pond. So

28:27.906 --> 28:38.820
anyway, I made this transition in the middle of my 
PhD period and started off in this impoverished

28:27.906 --> 28:38.820
apartment, there was this man named Cunningham, 
And there was a really good man, Harold Jeffries,

28:39.188 --> 28:46.719
who was a loner, a theoretical physicist. He 
started as a botanist, actually, and then came to

28:47.220 --> 28:50.865
Cambridge and did mathematics. And he was a 
theoretical physicist, a man who had great

28:51.486 --> 28:58.696
difficulty in explaining himself verbally, a 
very bad lecturer. And he was nominally a member of

28:59.617 --> 29:05.326
the department, but he never turned up, actually. 
I mean, I never saw him. we had one or two in the

29:08.399 --> 29:14.088
department, it was one or two rooms, and I really 
never saw him there. But he became, after a year or

29:14.668 --> 29:23.622
so, he became attached to me and to my wife. He was a 
lonely man who had made many attempts to get

29:24.924 --> 29:31.614
married unsuccessfully to very unsuitable 
women. He used to ask girls from the theatrical

29:34.910 --> 29:42.321
companies that visited Cambridge, always two at a 
time, to come to tea with him. And it must have been a

29:43.103 --> 29:49.633
joke, I think, among the touring companies of 
England, because they always came, apparently.

29:49.653 --> 29:54.100
These rather elegant young women would come and 
have tea with Harold Jeffreys. And his rooms were

29:54.120 --> 29:55.502
very odd. He lived in college, and his rooms, he had 
deck chairs. I don't quite know why, in his rooms.
