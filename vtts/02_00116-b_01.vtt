WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:10.197
One thing I found out was I was never in a hurry to get 
back to A&M on Sundays. And I don't think anybody

00:11.440 --> 00:12.862
else was. It was, you know, you're proud of your 
school, you're proud of A&M and everything, but

00:13.002 --> 00:23.179
A&M on Sundays was not, there was nothing going on 
here. And so we, you know, there was things going on

00:23.219 --> 00:26.324
in Houston. I remember Jones Hall, as a matter of 
fact, I even have some tickets where we would, on

00:27.858 --> 00:41.232
Sundays, we'd go to Sunday afternoon matinees at 
Jones Hall, and there would be entertainers

00:27.858 --> 00:41.232
there, Peter, Paul, and Mary, Johnny Mathis. And 
on Saturday night, would there also sometimes be a

00:41.392 --> 00:48.219
big dance at the Rice or something like that? Well, 
you know, I don't recall

00:48.400 --> 00:57.409
going to that, what happened, what happened was my 
high school would, you know, 98% of my high school

00:58.148 --> 01:05.880
went to Texas. Lamar High School people went to 
Texas. Or maybe SMU or TCU or Baylor, you know, but

01:09.766 --> 01:14.354
they didn't go to A&M. And most, there was a large 
number of my high school that I'd gone to

01:15.475 --> 01:25.371
elementary school, junior high school, and high 
school with, and so it seemed like my high school

01:15.475 --> 01:25.371
guys would come back, would be back in town, and we 
would have high school parties, and I would invite

01:26.363 --> 01:38.436
my Aggie friends to those high school parties. I 
think Ginny's here. She'll catch it. But I don't

01:41.680 --> 01:50.549
remember Aggie-focused

01:41.680 --> 01:50.549
parties that I went to. Now, at Fort Worth, it was 
different. Describe that court trip. Well, at the

01:54.022 --> 01:57.987
Fort Worth court trip, it was TCU, of course, we 
were playing. I was not from Fort Worth. I didn't

01:59.869 --> 02:03.253
know anything about Fort Worth, so it was a 
reversal of roles. And so I stayed at somebody's

02:04.374 --> 02:12.723
house, and his name was Mike Bryan, Fish Bryan. I 
stayed at Mike's house, but because I was dating

02:12.743 --> 02:20.232
Jeannie, I didn't. I didn't date anybody up there, 
so I don't recall going to the parties afterwards.

02:29.906 --> 02:35.892
And I think the TCU game that year was a night game, 
so it wasn't over until 10.30 or so. In your four

02:35.952 --> 02:48.025
years, do you remember any kind of negative event 
as a part of the parade, the march? Did the audience

02:48.528 --> 02:51.271
ever behave negatively? No. Matter of fact, I've 
marched all over the world in all kinds of

02:52.913 --> 03:03.847
situations, and I've never had an incident where 
anybody threw anything at us, and certainly at

02:52.913 --> 03:03.847
that point in time didn't. There was a lot of people 
down there, and the core marching... It's

03:10.955 --> 03:13.017
impressive to this day. It was impressive then. 
It's always commanded respect. Yeah, so I don't

03:15.540 --> 03:19.324
recall any shenanigans at all. That fall, while 
all this is going on, were you going to class

03:20.706 --> 03:26.412
regularly? Oh, yeah. Because I was not a good 
student, I mean, I wasn't a natural student, I

03:28.615 --> 03:35.683
never missed class. And I was always on time, and I 
always did my homework regularly. you know, to the

03:40.368 --> 03:41.790
best of my abilities. And that's what a lot of times 
would get me from a C to a B. Did you have any rules

03:47.439 --> 03:50.664
about where you sat in the room? Front or the back? I 
didn't sit either one. I wasn't a front row, you

03:57.254 --> 04:01.380
know, I wasn't a spring butt. But I wasn't a 
rear-rank Rudy either. I think... Wait a minute.

04:06.063 --> 04:06.544
Rear-rank? Rear-rank Rudy. Rudy? Rudy. R-U-D-Y? 
Yeah, that's the little guys. In the formation,

04:12.033 --> 04:13.796
back in the old days. Now, I changed it. When I 
became an officer, I didn't form my... See, the way

04:14.598 --> 04:23.453
you'd form a company at A&M was... except for the 
seniors and juniors, everybody else marched by

04:23.838 --> 04:41.053
size and you formed up from the right side and so 
from the left guide and so I was always the right

04:23.838 --> 04:41.053
rear guy, rear rank Rudy and so When I got in the real 
army, I wouldn't let my first sergeant size the

04:41.894 --> 04:46.339
men. I would march them by squads and keep them in 
squad integrity. My formations never looked

04:51.285 --> 04:58.012
quite as sharp as the Aggies, but I always felt that 
squad integrity was more important than looks.

04:58.873 --> 05:09.285
Were you all in the era when classes and or 
instructors had nicknames?

05:10.987 --> 05:13.951
Well, it may have been, but I don't recall. It's 
about that time that they started ending. Yeah, I

05:17.637 --> 05:18.959
don't recall. I

05:18.979 --> 05:38.547
was raised where authority was authority, and as 
long as the professor

05:18.979 --> 05:38.547
did what he was supposed to do, he commanded 
authority, and I wasn't. I wasn't going to do

05:39.050 --> 05:46.472
anything to that

05:39.050 --> 05:46.472
authority. The faculty members were always there 
to teach? Yeah. And if you needed to see one in his or

05:52.999 --> 05:57.224
her office, they were available? They were. 
Matter of fact, I was impressed.

06:04.432 --> 06:07.576
I wasn't a good student, a great student, and I 
wasn't a bad student. So I was kind of in the middle

06:07.596 --> 06:09.959
of the road. So I didn't have an occasion to need a 
lot of meetings. But I remember some professors

06:17.868 --> 06:21.392
made you. have a one-on-one with them. And you got a 
card and you had a time. And I thought that was a good

06:26.748 --> 06:36.701
technique because I did like

06:26.748 --> 06:36.701
my chemistry class. It was 200 or 300 in my 
chemistry class my freshman year. And I didn't

06:40.346 --> 06:41.327
like that. I liked 30-man classrooms where you 
could identify with a professor. Because, kind of

06:46.550 --> 06:53.162
like football, the reason I got to play was not 
because of my talent, but because of my heart. The

06:54.004 --> 06:56.108
coaches, I mean, I knew all my plays. I practiced. I 
was always there, always on time, and I gave it my

06:58.713 --> 07:02.019
all. It's just I didn't have the natural talents 
that other people had. But they would play me just

07:05.806 --> 07:07.950
because... I would die before I let anybody down. 
Well, in a small classroom, a professor would

07:11.348 --> 07:21.122
figure out that I always did my homework, I was 
always prepared, and I was honest, and I would do

07:11.348 --> 07:21.122
everything I could. It's just that I wasn't a 
gifted student. But in a big classroom, it was just

07:24.527 --> 07:28.053
numbers, and you were at a disadvantage. And so I 
did like it when you got to meet instructors and

07:28.333 --> 07:34.562
start some kind of a personal relationship. And 
you didn't have any teaching assistants. You had

07:37.311 --> 07:38.573
real faculty members. I don't ever remember a 
teaching assistant. Now, what I do remember, you

07:41.637 --> 07:59.301
know, later on, and we'll get to that, I guess, was 
all the international students that A&M had and

07:41.637 --> 07:59.301
how impressed I was with that because they were 
from Pakistan, they were from Saudi Arabia, they

07:41.637 --> 07:59.301
were from all over, a lot of them in agriculture. 
And I thought that was kind of neat that A&M was

07:59.973 --> 08:02.817
doing that. I didn't realize at the time what a big 
program it was and how important it was. It's just

08:09.345 --> 08:17.115
that I thought it was neat that here this Texas 
Agriculture School had all these foreign

08:09.345 --> 08:17.115
students. And the foreign students were all very 
dedicated and hardworking, and I kind of enjoyed

08:17.575 --> 08:24.664
interacting with them. All right, another big 
ritual bonfire. What did you do with bonfire your

08:31.067 --> 08:33.230
freshman year? Nothing. We didn't have one. 
Kennedy was shot, and I was passing Henderson

08:36.275 --> 08:48.795
Hall, going to dorm night 17, and one of the Melton 
twins, and I never could tell them apart, ran out

08:36.275 --> 08:48.795
and said, Randy, have you heard what happened in 
Dallas?" And I said, no. And he said, President

08:54.304 --> 08:57.028
Kennedy has been shot dead.

09:00.092 --> 09:01.594
And I know exactly where I was. And I said, you know, 
and I started thinking about it, you know,

09:01.674 --> 09:12.167
assassinations and what I'd read and history and 
everything. You know, and I asked a bunch of

09:13.295 --> 09:16.679
questions and it was on the radio. We went into 
Harrison Hall and they were talking about it. And

09:19.403 --> 09:26.011
then the next day or that same day, you know, 
General Rutter announced there would be no

09:19.403 --> 09:26.011
bonfire that year. So my Thanksgiving, November 
of 63, there was no bonfire. Now, we did play Texas

09:33.520 --> 09:38.526
University and we played them at home and they were 
rated number one in the nation. And at the end of the

09:39.164 --> 09:42.009
first half, we were winning 21-0. We were 
outscored 24-21. But there was no bonfire. Now,

09:47.718 --> 09:50.342
there had been some cutting done. Yeah, right. But 
you and your outfit were not involved at that

09:51.183 --> 09:54.468
point. Well, I was helping with the chainsaw crew 
because I was a flatheader, and they knew it. my

10:02.654 --> 10:21.393
reputation, you know, being on this farm and 
having a pine tree farm that, you know, and I had a

10:02.654 --> 10:21.393
26-pound McCullough chainsaw, and so they were 
logging hardwood just south of here, and when they

10:02.654 --> 10:21.393
would bring them up, and the bonfire then was 
behind Sabisa. It wasn't over where the accident

10:22.034 --> 10:28.481
was, and so I don't remember as a company project. I 
just remember being singled out And the couple

10:31.426 --> 10:39.295
days before, I was sizing logs, and I was showing 
people how to do that and whatever. And I kind of

10:39.496 --> 10:48.426
liked that because I was a fish, and I knew more 
about what we were doing than anybody that around.

10:48.506 --> 10:51.830
And there was a lot of upperclassmen, but they 
didn't know what they were doing. And I'd run a

10:52.871 --> 10:56.956
chainsaw since I was 10 or 11 years old. Had you all 
cut? any down or many down? Well I wasn't cutting

11:00.064 --> 11:26.509
them somebody else was cutting them and they were 
bringing them in and we were sizing them and saying

11:00.064 --> 11:26.509
okay these were going to be the base logs and we 
wanted them 32 feet long and so we were measuring

11:00.064 --> 11:26.509
and I was cutting them 32 feet or whatever it was and 
then okay these logs are smaller we'll have those

11:00.064 --> 11:26.509
for the second deck and then we want that to be you 
know 24 feet long and so I was cutting and then the

11:00.064 --> 11:26.509
logs would come in 26 feet and you'd have to cut two 
feet off the small end. And so I was thinking that

11:30.603 --> 11:36.573
part of the bonfire was already erected, wasn't 
it? Well, I don't remember that. I remember my

11:39.337 --> 11:45.848
mission was I was cutting logs away from where the 
center pole was. I know the center pole was in place

11:48.526 --> 11:51.770
because that was done early. And the others were 
still on. Yeah, but I don't remember the crane yet

11:53.853 --> 12:04.227
hauling anything because in subsequent years, 
see, I was in charge of the bonfire chainsaws. And

12:04.247 --> 12:11.296
so when I was, my junior and senior year was one of 
the few people that caught on the stacks. Describe

12:11.617 --> 12:12.578
that. Well, back then, we didn't stand the bonfire 
straight up. They were angled in. Now you gotta

12:24.491 --> 12:38.267
understand that everybody that worked around the 
bonfire, that really worked around the logs, were

12:24.491 --> 12:38.267
farm boys or people that kind of understood those 
kind of things. They weren't engineers, but we

12:38.327 --> 12:40.590
understood heavy equipment and the dangers. I 
remember how important it was that the center post

12:45.600 --> 12:51.969
be stout and properly bolted. I remember even 
being part of the packing crew that would pack and

12:52.009 --> 12:58.458
make sure the center pole was strong. My job was to 
pick the initial logs that would become the

12:59.640 --> 13:06.409
critical logs that the first base logs would build 
around, and so we would bring all the base logs in,

13:07.216 --> 13:37.138
the biggest of the trees, and we'd put those, 
categorize them, and then I'd study them, and then

13:07.216 --> 13:37.138
we would, you know, I was, this was my junior year, 
you know, I said, okay, let's use that one, and so

13:07.216 --> 13:37.138
then they would bring that up, and we would drag it 
up with the tractor, and then the crane would lift

13:07.216 --> 13:37.138
it up, and we would lean it into the post, and we'd 
put one in, and then put one on the 180, and then put

13:37.793 --> 13:51.194
one on the 180, and we'd fill up that first, oh, 
about eight logs, and then we would start filling

13:37.793 --> 13:51.194
on top. Well, on the sides, when we got to where we, 
where whoever was in charge thought that was

13:51.234 --> 14:05.877
enough, and we would start to build the second 
deck, a selected few of us we'd get on the crane,

14:06.160 --> 14:17.419
we'd put our foot in the hook, and we'd have the 
chainsaw in one hand, and we would go up on the

14:06.160 --> 14:17.419
second deck, or on the first deck, and we were the 
flatheaders. And we would cut off to make the

14:18.120 --> 14:26.935
tabletop, because even though we had measured all 
the logs, when you leaned them, you ended up with

14:18.120 --> 14:26.935
long and short logs. And so what you wanted for your 
second deck was as flat as you could, so we went in

14:27.015 --> 14:32.404
there and but but uh back then uh we all matter of 
fact we all talked about you know what happens if it

14:33.008 --> 14:59.185
falls and we all had plans so i'm gonna ride this log 
down i'm gonna grab for the hook uh or whatever but

14:33.008 --> 14:59.185
there was only three to five of us ever allowed and 
and it was and the people up there were all uh

14:33.008 --> 14:59.185
knowledgeable of um heavy equipment chainsaws 
You know, we wore the right kind of boots. And no

15:02.314 --> 15:04.456
hijinks. And there was, no. Up there. No, this was 
all serious because this was very dangerous and we

15:07.839 --> 15:11.383
knew it. And were you all working 24 hours a day? 
Yeah, they had us floodlights out there. And I

15:18.689 --> 15:23.053
think my junior year I did most of the night shift. 
My senior year I did most of the day shift. About how

15:25.355 --> 15:29.239
many weeks did you and the others work on that? I 
remember it being a long time. Was it? It was a

15:33.833 --> 15:35.336
couple of weeks for sure. But it wasn't a month or 
two? Oh, no, no, no. It got real serious just the

15:38.763 --> 15:41.508
week before. And I used to think... if I was in 
charge, I could be better organized and shorten

15:44.373 --> 15:54.184
the time because it was taking you away from 
classes and a lot of competing things. And I felt

15:54.264 --> 16:03.253
the bonfire was important, but I always felt that 
if it was better organized, it could be done in a

15:54.264 --> 16:03.253
shorter period of time. But I did always think that 
none of the bonfires that I was involved in ever

16:03.894 --> 16:10.741
fell prematurely. And did you all have a prejudged 
size. Yeah, matter of fact I have pictures of the

16:15.625 --> 16:19.930
bonfire and it was only you know. You weren't 
trying to build it bigger than ever before. No, no I

16:23.073 --> 16:24.755
don't know when that started. That started after I 
left that every year it had to be bigger than the

16:24.775 --> 16:38.749
year before because ours I think was three decks, 
three decks of big logs and then maybe a fourth deck

16:24.775 --> 16:38.749
of just a few logs and that were cabled together. 
You can see the cable, I've got the pictures but I

16:43.115 --> 16:53.934
don't know when the zealousness started of, I 
don't know when it started of standing them

16:43.115 --> 16:53.934
straight up, because I could have told them that 
was not going to work. And I don't know when they

16:54.795 --> 16:57.740
started making it so high. And that all happened 
after 67. Now, who was actually in charge of

17:02.508 --> 17:07.637
Bonfire? There was a cadet, and it wasn't Eddie Joe 
Davis. I mean, it wasn't, you know, Eddie Joe was

17:11.060 --> 17:13.062
our corps commander. It wasn't him. There was a 
designated guy, and it was somebody, you kind of

17:14.544 --> 17:26.099
grew into that position, and it had nothing to do 
with corps leadership or whatever. What was kind

17:26.139 --> 17:32.207
of neat about the bonfire, they figured out that 
they better have people who knew what they were

17:26.139 --> 17:32.207
doing, so they your core positions didn't count. 
They were looking for the talent of people that had

17:36.177 --> 17:41.486
done things like that growing up. In your four 
years of working on Bonfire. Three years, yeah.

17:44.952 --> 17:45.172
Three. What is the worst accident that you 
remember? I do not remember an accident. Even a

17:51.864 --> 17:53.326
smashed finger or anything. Really? Nobody broke 
a leg? No, I don't remember any accident. On my

17:56.792 --> 17:57.874
watch... where I was involved, there was never an 
accident. We could have sprained an ankle or

18:02.042 --> 18:05.426
something, but nobody ever said anything about 
it. As far as you know, what kind of drinking and

18:05.706 --> 18:09.130
hijinks went on out? Well, what was interesting 
was all

18:10.371 --> 18:22.524
my friends and everybody knew that I didn't drink. 
And they knew I didn't really like to be around

18:23.625 --> 18:26.528
drinkers. So it just didn't happen around me. I 
didn't see it. I knew it was going on, but it wasn't.

18:36.660 --> 18:44.113
The guys that were working on the bonfire,

18:36.660 --> 18:44.113
I mean, this was serious business to us. And I think 
the guys that were probably drinking were the guys

18:48.952 --> 18:57.203
that, the wannabes that wished they knew what they 
were doing couldn't, and so they were out there

18:48.952 --> 18:57.203
just fooling around. But they stayed, you know, 
away outside the crane, outside the bulldozers. I

19:03.231 --> 19:07.998
mean, inside that ring, I always felt was a fairly 
disciplined group of guys. And there were no,

19:08.238 --> 19:11.663
there were so few co-eds. I never saw a co-ed on the 
bonfire in my three years. And there weren't any

19:15.368 --> 19:17.431
women hanging around. No. So it was a, No, it was, 
no. You know, you never know for sure, and I guess

19:22.316 --> 19:29.408
somebody could remind you of something you don't 
remember, but, you know, I've read the accident

19:22.316 --> 19:29.408
report. I was in Pacific when, and I read all the 
stuff on the webpage, and I don't remember any of

19:29.428 --> 19:39.985
that kind of stuff going on. Right, so you go home 
Thanksgiving and Christmas, and then get your

19:40.454 --> 19:45.802
grades the first semester. You passed 
everything. Yeah, I did okay the first semester. I

19:48.847 --> 19:50.049
mean, I did pretty good, really. So you're still 
planning on veterinary medicine, second

19:50.610 --> 19:55.197
semester. How did the spring semester go? Well, I 
found out that I was a better fall student. All my

20:02.559 --> 20:06.464
fall semesters, the grades were much better than 
the spring semesters. Is there any reason? I think

20:07.826 --> 20:09.328
I get spring fever. I thought I, as soon as winter 
was over and it started being spring, you know, I

20:09.528 --> 20:18.320
was ready to head to the woods again. You know, I 
mean, I was, I just, and that's the only thing I can

20:18.360 --> 20:22.105
remember because I just reviewed all, I've got all 
my transcripts from, and the only, you know, the

20:22.675 --> 20:27.800
exception to that was graduate school. I made all 
As in graduate school, but by that time I was an Army

20:27.820 --> 20:37.189
captain, and I was told, you're representing the 
U.S. Army, and so I made all As in graduate school.

20:37.209 --> 20:44.236
But at A&M, I made good grades in the fall, and I made 
okay grades in the spring. All right, then you go

20:45.177 --> 20:49.341
home, and what did you do that first summer? I went 
to Carrizo Springs and I worked at my uncle's ranch

20:49.861 --> 20:56.648
all summer long. Six dollars a day, room and board. 
We were awake at 4.30. We would have the horses

21:02.454 --> 21:07.380
saddled by 5.30 and we worked cattle all summer. 
And the funniest story on that one, and I love it,

21:08.721 --> 21:18.872
was I came back and I didn't shave or get a haircut 
all summer. And I never left the ranch. The ranch

21:20.974 --> 21:22.957
was 70,000 acres. And I went down there, and I never 
left the ranch for three months. And I was the

21:28.223 --> 21:37.513
junior cowboy, so I always was bringing up the rear 
of all the cattle drives. And I always had the dirty

21:38.474 --> 21:40.277
jobs. And so I

21:40.337 --> 21:45.563
chose not to shave. And I didn't grow a pretty 
beard, but I grew a beard after three months. And I

21:49.514 --> 22:02.428
came back, my cousin, who went to my first cousin, 
one of my first cousins, and one of my dearest

21:49.514 --> 22:02.428
friends, was accepted to vet school. And so he, his 
name was Donald Dauron from Louisiana, and he'd

22:04.069 --> 22:13.239
gone to Southwestern in Lafayette and was 
accepted to A&M Vet School. He was a native Cajun.

22:15.822 --> 22:17.884
So he's married, too. And they're living over in 
the World War II barracks that had an unsavory

22:18.640 --> 22:26.128
name, but I loved the name. I mean, because it was 
where all the married people lived back then. And

22:32.454 --> 22:40.322
so I had talked to Donald from the ranch, and he was 
already here, because vet students had to be here a

22:32.454 --> 22:40.322
little early. And he was going to start vet school. 
So they had gotten this apartment. They were

22:44.646 --> 22:48.310
living on the first floor of one of those old army 
barracks. And so I drove up in my pickup truck and

22:48.982 --> 22:52.008
I'd never met his wife. And this is one of my closest 
cousins, but he'd gotten married and I'd just

22:53.029 --> 22:58.179
never met Marie. So I knocked on the door and I got a 
beard on and long hair and cowboy boots and blue

22:59.081 --> 23:06.534
jeans. And she says, oh, I'm glad you're here. The 
problem is under the sink. And so I followed her.

23:16.047 --> 23:21.174
And I said, well, and so I said, she said, don't you 
have some tools? And I said, well, they're in my

23:21.495 --> 23:24.018
truck, but I want to see what the problem is. I mean, 
I loved it. And so she said, it's just leaking at

23:25.280 --> 23:33.270
that turn under the sink. And I said, well, let me 
look at it, and then I'll know what tools to bring.

23:35.814 --> 23:38.918
So she opens up under the sink, and I crawl under the 
sink. Well, about that time, Donald walks in the

23:39.758 --> 23:48.610
kitchen, and I come out from under the sink, and he 
says, Randy, what are you doing under the sink? And

23:48.630 --> 23:51.174
Marie says, that's not Randy, that's the plumber. 
And he says, no, no, that's my cousin Randy. And to

23:55.480 --> 23:59.745
this day, it's the biggest laugh that my darling 
Marie and I have. But no, I cowboyed all summer. I

24:04.252 --> 24:08.938
went to, you know, and just, we worked seven days a 
week, And you're still at that point determined to

24:09.391 --> 24:13.094
be a veterinarian? Right, and I was vaccinating 
and doing all the cutting and doing all the

24:13.114 --> 24:19.260
veterinary type work down there on the ranch. How 
was being a sophomore at A&M different from being a

24:19.500 --> 24:23.243
freshman? Well, you're a new outfit. Yeah, I'm in 
B1 now over in the new core area and Mickey Ballard

24:26.506 --> 24:38.757
is our company commander. And I'm a sophomore. 
It's

24:42.039 --> 24:52.990
sad to say I didn't take the Corps real serious. I 
was taking the ROTC courses, and there was two

24:54.031 --> 25:04.862
officers over there, Captain Bolting, who died in 
Vietnam, and Captain Jim Simmons, who retired as

25:05.348 --> 25:14.819
Lieutenant Colonel and is still a lifelong friend 
of mine, they were instructors and I was real

25:05.348 --> 25:14.819
impressed with them. And so I was serious about 
ROTC, but I wasn't a serious Corps guy. I just, I

25:23.949 --> 25:34.301
kind of tolerated it, you know, because to be 
honest, and you can read in my journals, it wasn't

25:23.949 --> 25:34.301
anything that I disliked. I just had so many 
interests. I mean, I was still rodeo clowning. I

25:39.737 --> 25:40.999
was still calf roping. I was running this ranch. 
You know, I was playing music, playing guitar. I

25:46.885 --> 25:53.732
had so many interests that, and then I was, and this 
was my home all around here. I mean, I knew

25:53.792 --> 25:55.774
everybody in every town. And, and, you know, so 
many of the people were from your shoe in the, in the

25:56.815 --> 26:04.263
valley and, and, and, and the A&M was their family. 
But for me, Off post was my family. I never caused

26:08.888 --> 26:12.453
any trouble. I did everything I was supposed to do, 
but my heart wasn't in it. I remember as a

26:18.041 --> 26:25.491
sophomore, your mission was you had to teach the 
fish all these things. I chose to teach them like a

26:26.313 --> 26:30.679
couple of my football coaches that I liked. I was 
treating them totally with dignity and respect.

26:35.613 --> 26:39.658
and was telling them why and was talking to them 
pretty natural. And I remember one of the juniors

26:39.718 --> 26:43.382
called me in and says, you have to holler at them. 
And I said, okay, I mean, I can, but that's not my

26:44.403 --> 26:50.651
style. And I said, I think they'll see through it 
very quickly. And he says, no, you've got to, you

26:53.534 --> 26:57.318
know, you're just not tough enough on the fish. And 
I said, well, let me do this. You put me responsible

27:01.243 --> 27:03.966
for some fish. and tell me what they're supposed to 
do. And after a few weeks, let's evaluate my fish to

27:07.040 --> 27:12.248
somebody who's been hollering at them. Well, he 
didn't take me up on it, because I think he knew that

27:12.829 --> 27:20.502
I would coddle them and bring them around and 
everything. So I was an upperclassman. who never

27:22.829 --> 27:32.845
really harassed the fish, but, you know, 
interacted with them and tried to teach them, you

27:22.829 --> 27:32.845
know, the important things about A&M. And there 
was some, you know, there was some really great

27:32.885 --> 27:42.320
things that I felt that by the time I was a sophomore 
that I understood that they needed to understand.

27:43.342 --> 27:46.247
And who was the commandant at that era? Baker, 
Colonel Baker. is who I remember. What was your

27:50.104 --> 27:52.968
impression and remembrance of him? He was a crusty 
colonel, and if you didn't screw up, you never had

27:53.809 --> 28:01.180
the scene. If you just did your job, you could... 
And I was kind of that way. Matter of fact, I never

28:07.529 --> 28:16.562
met General Rutter personally because the only 
people that met General Rutter were really good

28:07.529 --> 28:16.562
students and really bad students. and I was in 
between. But what did you in general, what did you

28:19.284 --> 28:25.896
and all of your closest buddies, what was your 
impression of him as a person? Colonel Baker? No,

28:27.199 --> 28:27.620
Rutter. Oh, I mean he was on a pedestal. Matter of 
fact, when I remember I was in distinct minority

28:37.400 --> 28:41.905
And as a sophomore, my sophomore year is when the 
first women came to A&M, 64. Yeah, talk about the

28:42.045 --> 28:47.430
attitude you all had, you and your 
contemporaries, about those changes. Well, I

28:47.651 --> 28:53.877
remember I was in the minority in that I thought it 
was a good thing. And one of the reasons I thought it

28:55.198 --> 29:04.588
was a good thing was because I had read that General 
Rutter was a proponent of it and felt it was

28:55.198 --> 29:04.588
important to the future of the now university. 
Because at the same time, we went from a college to a

29:07.327 --> 29:10.350
university. And he did both of those things. And he 
was criticized and credited with both of them. But

29:18.919 --> 29:26.507
because he did them, matter of fact, there was a big 
debate was, I'm going to have AMC on my ring. And I

29:27.649 --> 29:33.495
said, well, if I ever get a ring, I'm going to have 
Texas A&M University. And it was all because of

29:34.623 --> 29:36.346
General Rutter. I met him, and I'd like to tell that 
story. I met him on my way to Vietnam. I had gone

29:46.962 --> 29:49.446
through all my schooling. I'd gone to the 82nd 
Airborne and jumped out of airplanes for a while.

29:53.252 --> 29:54.093
The Army called up. They saw that I was a pilot with a 
lot of hours. And I think it was in my records how I'd

29:58.417 --> 30:05.205
done in elementary flight training. So the Army 
called up and asked me to go to flight school. And I

30:08.749 --> 30:12.113
said, whatever y'all want me to do. And so I went to 
flight school. Well, I was going to Vietnam in

30:16.659 --> 30:19.642
December of 69. And I was really, you know, my 
intent was to go to Vietnam, serve my country, come

30:25.467 --> 30:29.591
back and try to get back in vet school. So Dr. Wooten 
was my, because I graduated in ag eco, which was a

30:30.371 --> 30:39.920
natural thing for a veterinary and medicine guy to 
do. So Dr. Wooten was my advisor, and so I was on

30:40.721 --> 30:54.293
leaving Houston en route to Vietnam, and I called 
him from Houston, and he said, well, Ray, why don't

30:40.721 --> 30:54.293
you come up and let's talk about what you want to do a 
year from now. Because, you know, I was just going

30:55.218 --> 31:04.060
to serve my country and go back to college, go back 
to, you know, some kind of graduate school and try

30:55.218 --> 31:04.060
to get back in or try to get in vet school. Well, so 
I'm up here to see Dr. Wooten, and he said, so he

31:04.922 --> 31:11.117
said,
