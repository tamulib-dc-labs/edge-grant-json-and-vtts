WEBVTT

00:03.254 --> 00:11.624
It got to the point where the United Gas Pipeline project was so big that these two individuals as consultants really couldn't handle it.

00:11.644 --> 00:13.446
They needed an institutional connection.

00:14.147 --> 00:19.373
So they came to A&M and we took on the project through the research foundation.

00:20.555 --> 00:22.397
I understand the relation of the foundation.

00:22.417 --> 00:31.388
The foundation is financially independent of the university and of the state, but dedicated to it.

00:31.925 --> 00:38.171
so we could operate through that within the framework of the college.

00:38.191 --> 00:54.306
As you look back on it, were there any of those research grants that which now obviously were really important steps to the to solidifying the program?

00:55.367 --> 00:59.451
Was there one that now looks like a key one that led to many others?

01:01.996 --> 01:06.842
I'd say the ONR one, the Hydrographic Office and the ONR one.

01:07.502 --> 01:12.909
And it's interesting at that time, ONR told me they cannot support a new oceanography program.

01:13.029 --> 01:14.811
They're dedicated to Scripps and Woods Hole.

01:15.932 --> 01:20.738
And as long as they're going all right and they had some money left over, we might get a little.

01:20.758 --> 01:27.125
But as time went on, they had not too large a contribution, but a steady one and also a flexible one.

01:27.866 --> 01:29.708
So I'd say the ONR grants would be.

01:30.143 --> 01:34.088
But then the National Science Fund came in with a very significant grant.

01:35.169 --> 01:45.041
This was responsible because of Hugh McClellan on our faculty, who raised the money for a real ocean-going ship.

01:45.061 --> 01:50.066
And he not only raised the money, he made the plans.

01:50.707 --> 01:59.037
He got us a small freighter, a retired Army vessel, I think it was 179 feet.

01:59.742 --> 02:03.127
Got a million dollars from the Science Foundation to convert it.

02:03.848 --> 02:11.881
It worked out so well that they made six more of the same kind for other universities.

02:12.682 --> 02:15.867
At that time, the competition was a class of ships.

02:15.928 --> 02:21.516
They decided the only good ship would be one planned from the hull up for oceanography.

02:21.536 --> 02:24.902
Those cost 20 million, and they weren't being too satisfactory.

02:25.262 --> 02:27.606
And when they got them built, there wasn't money to operate them.

02:28.008 --> 02:32.935
So everybody was happy to get this $1 million ship, which was fully capable of deep ocean work.

02:32.955 --> 02:34.938
And like I say, they did six of them.

02:34.958 --> 02:36.801
Hugh McClellan is responsible for that.

02:37.121 --> 02:39.925
That was a grant that's very significant.

02:39.945 --> 02:54.246
And as you were leading this program, I presume that Scripps and Woods Hole were kind of models for the quality of program you hope to get recognized here.

02:54.366 --> 02:54.927
Is that right?

02:55.463 --> 03:00.309
Well, the model for oceanography is difficult to define.

03:01.311 --> 03:04.335
It's such a variety of things.

03:05.937 --> 03:08.220
The Scripps curriculum was one that we followed.

03:09.241 --> 03:12.585
That was the first one that had ever been offered, I think, in 1945.

03:12.806 --> 03:16.150
And I was a student there.

03:16.691 --> 03:20.796
That's the only time Harold Svredip was able to teach for two years in a row.

03:21.147 --> 03:24.473
because he'd been in the field and all kinds of things.

03:25.154 --> 03:28.700
So academically, I'd say Scripps was an ideal we tried to follow.

03:29.241 --> 03:33.087
Research-wise, there's really no pattern.

03:36.433 --> 03:43.224
Woods Hole, Columbus Island, oceanography was a hobby of his, and they got into anti-submarine warfare.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.927
That was the big area, of course.

03:45.920 --> 03:51.227
And Scripps goes into this from a more theoretical side of physics of acoustics underwater.

03:52.148 --> 03:56.333
So we tried to approach that quality in that area.

03:56.533 --> 03:58.075
That was one you could sort of define.

03:59.457 --> 04:06.466
As the program here was developing, did A&M oceanographers have competitors?

04:06.986 --> 04:13.094
Were there other institutions that A&M was going up against for grants and contracts?

04:13.474 --> 04:13.935
Sure.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.648
There were always peer reviews of proposals.

04:18.233 --> 04:25.073
In the first meeting, let's see, President Bolton told me, don't hire anybody from University of Texas.

04:25.610 --> 04:28.353
In other words, they were kind of our competitor.

04:28.473 --> 04:32.338
They had hoped to build an oceanography program, and they had some good people, good things.

04:33.119 --> 04:42.430
LSU had hoped to do the same thing, and Gordon Gunter, who directed that, I guess he directed that program, but he was also in Mississippi.

04:43.191 --> 04:45.134
He tried to do this.

04:45.574 --> 04:46.996
He wanted to join our faculty.

04:47.016 --> 04:52.022
He really did, but we couldn't do that.

04:52.525 --> 04:56.790
And Joel Hedgepeth, another one from Bodega Bay in California, he wanted.

04:57.631 --> 05:01.616
But the question was, did we have competitors?

05:03.198 --> 05:11.509
I'd say almost every university in the country hoped to build an oceanography program, and there are about 90 of them now, I believe, something like that.

05:11.529 --> 05:14.092
There's an old book of curriculum on oceanography.

05:16.155 --> 05:18.938
The...

05:19.340 --> 05:23.806
College of Geoscience is established in 64, I believe you said.

05:25.308 --> 05:27.892
Can you summarize how that came about?

05:30.436 --> 05:32.579
I think there's a little difference of opinion on this.

05:33.260 --> 05:44.455
John Calhoun tells me that there had been some consideration of a college before that, but my case is pretty direct and straight, I think, and I have quoted some of the letters.

05:44.515 --> 05:49.262
As I said, when Frank Hubert became dean,

05:49.681 --> 05:54.727
of Arts and Sciences, and we were becoming very large and we were growing very fast.

05:55.828 --> 06:00.113
And as I see it, he decided that we should be a department like any other department.

06:00.494 --> 06:09.364
I asked him for a research administrative assistant, and the answer was, well, departments do not have administrative assistants, that kind of thing.

06:10.045 --> 06:11.807
We lost an instrument at sea.

06:12.344 --> 06:14.389
He really raked me over the coals for this.

06:14.530 --> 06:19.543
But if you've been out there with 40 knot winds and this thing swinging around, you have a little different view.

06:20.485 --> 06:25.358
But I think the key thing was he had decided in 1959

06:25.962 --> 06:35.185
that we're gonna be like other departments, that our salaries would have to be brought into, they were a little high because they were on soft money, a lot of them.

06:37.251 --> 06:42.604
But for five years I felt, what's the word, stymied, stymied.

06:43.580 --> 06:46.825
For example, we could not hire a new faculty member.

06:47.286 --> 06:58.062
Although we'd grow maybe double in size, there was no allowance for additional administrative help or academic science.

06:58.142 --> 07:07.155
We didn't look so good in the student-teacher ratio because we were graduate in PhD programs and heavily involved in research.

07:07.796 --> 07:12.844
And so, okay, we were stymied.

07:13.803 --> 07:18.188
And finally one year when everybody got big raises, our department did not.

07:19.389 --> 07:24.034
So I asked him, how about this?

07:25.695 --> 07:31.101
We have this growth and yet it looks like we're being held back.

07:32.182 --> 07:33.083
And I got no answer.

07:33.984 --> 07:36.366
And then I sent something else and I got no answer.

07:37.347 --> 07:41.852
So the only thing I could do to force an answer was to resign, which I did.

07:42.777 --> 07:48.145
And I said I would stay on for six months, and I did that.

07:48.225 --> 07:55.815
Well, after two months, there'd been no action whatsoever to find a replacement, and I knew this would be difficult.

07:58.279 --> 08:11.097
So I wrote a letter to the president, and I said, looks to me, since we have about 300 people and a couple million dollars of research, it looks to me like a simple replacement will not solve the problem.

08:11.752 --> 08:25.607
that it looks like the best thing might be to make a college with a group of meteorology department, oceanography department, geology department, geophysics department, and I put in geography.

08:26.548 --> 08:34.197
Later, Dean Deuce, D-U-C-E, told me he thought that was a stroke of genius to include geography with those sciences.

08:34.217 --> 08:36.019
It had been very useful since then.

08:36.880 --> 08:40.003
So I sent that letter to the president about October

08:40.523 --> 08:45.909
I'd resigned in maybe June, July, something like that, August.

08:45.929 --> 08:49.353
And not much happened here.

08:51.035 --> 08:54.920
Well, the president, President Rudder, didn't know what to do.

08:55.641 --> 08:57.523
I didn't talk to him through this period.

08:58.825 --> 09:01.848
But what he did is what any good president would do.

09:01.868 --> 09:03.951
He called in some consultants.

09:03.971 --> 09:07.695
And you have to be awfully careful when you call in oceanography consultants.

09:08.367 --> 09:16.897
One of these was Maurice Ewing, who was a Texan, a very famous seagoing Texan at Columbia University.

09:17.478 --> 09:21.984
But his ideas about oceanography were completely different than what we'd built up here.

09:22.705 --> 09:25.488
He didn't believe in classwork, academic work.

09:25.508 --> 09:28.452
He believed to put a fellow on a boat for a couple of years and send him out.

09:30.314 --> 09:32.937
He does well, give him a degree or something like this.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.000
Well, that was one of the consultants.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.783
Another one was a classmate of ours of Warren Worcester from

09:38.438 --> 09:39.780
University of Washington.

09:39.840 --> 09:44.946
He was most interested in international affairs, and we had not gotten that.

09:44.966 --> 09:50.752
And so we got a, as a result of those conferences, President Rudder wrote a letter to us.

09:51.353 --> 09:55.438
Actually, Dean Eurbert wrote this letter, and it was very discouraging.

09:55.458 --> 10:02.286
Said we have to meet the student-teacher ratio, the department chairman has got to teach more, and a lot of things like that.

10:03.515 --> 10:07.940
And Don Hood was in England at the time, and Bob Reed was trying to tell him what's going on.

10:07.960 --> 10:08.962
He didn't know what to say.

10:09.883 --> 10:17.632
But we had, as I mentioned, proposed a college of geosciences four or five months before.

10:18.994 --> 10:24.240
And along about this time, in December, Hugh McClellan wrote a letter to the president, and he said, I am hurt.

10:24.777 --> 10:27.922
that you've called on these consultants, but you have not talked to our people here.

10:28.082 --> 10:30.546
Our people here are some of the best ones in the country.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.151
Why don't you have a conversation with them?

10:34.172 --> 10:37.076
So he appointed a committee and made Bob Reed chairman, and I was on it.

10:37.777 --> 10:41.363
And we had about three weeks to make a recommendation.

10:42.404 --> 10:48.974
We recommended what I had put in the letter in October and turned that report into the president.

10:49.014 --> 10:51.358
I think this was January 22nd or so.

10:51.963 --> 10:56.428
because that was the end of my six-month period, and the president was insisting that he'd do something by then.

10:58.431 --> 11:04.478
And the college was approved, and when the college was approved, the whole world changed, the whole world changed.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.542
Wayne Hall was vice president for academic affairs then?

11:08.583 --> 11:12.908
Last I remember him, he was dean of the graduate school way back.

11:12.948 --> 11:14.590
This was in 50, maybe.

11:14.610 --> 11:17.093
So he had no part in this?

11:17.208 --> 11:18.329
Not that I know of.

11:18.369 --> 11:19.511
Okay.

11:19.531 --> 11:26.540
I could say here that he had offered me, when he left the graduate office, he had offered me the job of dean of graduate school.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.063
If he were capable of offering that, I don't know.

11:29.804 --> 11:32.928
But I decided at the time when I would like to stay with the department.

11:34.190 --> 11:41.759
So the recommendation to create a new college of geosciences with five departments.

11:41.819 --> 11:42.680
I think it was five.

11:42.781 --> 11:44.062
Including geography.

11:45.063 --> 11:45.164
Yeah.

11:45.184 --> 11:47.046
And the first dean was?

11:47.566 --> 11:49.889
Now, that's a very interesting story.

11:52.872 --> 11:59.859
They had to find a dean, of course, and my salary had been limited to 17,000, I think, at the time.

12:00.140 --> 12:04.705
It's very hard to find deans of oceanography and meteorology in particular for 17,000.

12:05.846 --> 12:17.218
But John Calhoun had come here in the 50s, and he'd come from Penn State, which is a very fine environmentally oriented university.

12:18.059 --> 12:21.745
And he immediately got interested in oceanography.

12:22.066 --> 12:24.129
He came over and talked.

12:24.149 --> 12:36.189
And then he became appointed as the administrative representative to the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, UCAR.

12:37.111 --> 12:38.774
And I was the science representative.

12:39.775 --> 12:40.877
Well, John, on that

12:42.123 --> 12:48.432
committee job, got acquainted with all the meteorology heads in the country and all the administrative people involved.

12:49.353 --> 12:50.555
And he did very well.

12:51.436 --> 12:54.400
First thing he knew, he was chairman of that committee.

12:55.502 --> 12:59.127
And then he went to Washington in the Department of Interior for a year or so.

12:59.167 --> 13:03.172
That does the fisheries work and the biological oceanography work.

13:05.656 --> 13:11.404
And he became the most knowledgeable person on the perspective

13:11.722 --> 13:18.272
of the oceanography department in the picture of the country and the international things.

13:19.954 --> 13:21.397
And he got to know Horace Byers.

13:21.457 --> 13:25.763
Byers was chairman of the UCAR committee when John came on.

13:25.783 --> 13:28.287
He got to know Byers, and they got along very well.

13:28.647 --> 13:30.330
Dr. Byers was then at Chicago?

13:30.971 --> 13:32.193
That's correct.

13:32.213 --> 13:32.734
That's correct.

13:33.815 --> 13:40.986
So a dean's job came open, and John Calhoun knew that Byers would be a good dean.

13:41.573 --> 13:44.779
And he heard a little clue that Byers wasn't too happy at Chicago.

13:45.861 --> 13:50.210
Well, he mentioned to him this possibility.

13:51.272 --> 13:52.254
And Byers said, no way.

13:52.475 --> 13:53.637
He didn't want to leave Chicago.

13:53.657 --> 13:54.659
He didn't want to be a dean.

13:56.162 --> 14:01.793
And John Callahan said, well, why don't you come down for a visit anyhow, which he did.

14:02.347 --> 14:09.218
And like I say, when anybody visits you, they become an instant Aggie if they get the treatment, especially.

14:09.979 --> 14:16.470
So Byers was hired as a new dean at a salary double what mine had been.

14:16.490 --> 14:20.617
And he was the best person in the country for this job.

14:21.398 --> 14:23.882
He was an oceanographer as well, a meteorologist.

14:24.689 --> 14:27.032
He was an experienced administrator.

14:27.473 --> 14:34.263
He was author of a good textbook, meteorology, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, just a nice person.

14:35.284 --> 14:37.888
So he became dean of the new college.

14:38.769 --> 14:42.174
And then the president changed the whole outlook.

14:42.194 --> 14:50.105
They made four new appointments in meteorology and oceanography and, I don't know, just a new world.

14:50.305 --> 14:54.291
So programming, not only was there a new organization,

14:54.794 --> 14:59.701
the program also expanded in its faculty numbers.

15:00.903 --> 15:01.203
Yes.

15:01.443 --> 15:02.505
Oh, yes.

15:02.525 --> 15:08.433
As I said, it was stymied for five years, so it broke loose and then caught up.

15:08.453 --> 15:09.414
That's the way I see it.

15:10.696 --> 15:19.148
And what other general comments do you have about Dr. Byer's years as the dean?

15:20.663 --> 15:25.089
Well, I remember one interesting thing at a cocktail party I just happened over here.

15:25.109 --> 15:30.096
Somebody asked him, how in the world did a program like this ever develop here at Texas A&M?

15:31.237 --> 15:35.803
And the dean's answer was, well, it's the most amazing series of coincidences.

15:37.065 --> 15:41.411
So what occurs to me is, yes, we had some interesting coincidences.

15:41.731 --> 15:45.837
We also wrote 400 research proposals and did a lot of hard work.

15:47.259 --> 15:49.742
But he was an excellent dean.

15:50.093 --> 15:55.100
Let's see, then who succeeded you as the department head?

15:57.924 --> 15:58.024
Oh.

15:58.405 --> 16:00.428
Or who were some key department heads?

16:00.588 --> 16:06.577
Yeah, at the day my six months ended, Willis Pequenault.

16:06.597 --> 16:12.145
Let's see, Bob Reed was appointed department head, which he held for two weeks.

16:14.929 --> 16:18.514
And then after that, Willis Pequenault.

16:18.933 --> 16:25.523
who was a biologist and a very smooth guy and a lot of experience in Washington and so on.

16:26.084 --> 16:32.954
So Willis Pequenault became department head and remained so for several years, I don't know how many.

16:33.194 --> 16:36.760
And his wife was also a marine scientist, Linda.

16:36.780 --> 16:41.106
All right, you mentioned wife there.

16:41.707 --> 16:44.331
Let's kind of divert our attention a bit.

16:45.312 --> 16:48.417
Describe your, for you and your family,

16:48.734 --> 16:51.217
living in College Station in the 60s.

16:51.817 --> 16:52.738
You really want that?

16:53.059 --> 16:53.179
Yes.

16:54.840 --> 16:55.982
Okay.

16:56.002 --> 16:57.483
My wife is with me.

16:57.743 --> 16:59.425
We've been married 57 years.

17:00.266 --> 17:04.571
And if I say anything that's a little off, I'll hear about it a little later today.

17:05.111 --> 17:11.338
Virginia started the Student Wives Club and became a very active and important part of the total program.

17:12.018 --> 17:18.285
And she also encouraged the faculty wives to get together.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.662
So I have to give her a lot of credit for that.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.406
What was life like in College Station?

17:25.129 --> 17:26.992
We went for a ride often on Sundays.

17:27.913 --> 17:29.135
We went over to the farms.

17:29.155 --> 17:33.021
I took my daughter Janet, who is here today, along.

17:35.085 --> 17:37.168
We saw a tree 40, 50 foot high.

17:37.208 --> 17:41.495
The leaves had fallen off the tree, but it was full of buzzards.

17:41.575 --> 17:44.239
There were 50 or 75 buzzards sitting in the tree.

17:44.708 --> 18:14.007
interesting thing is they were all facing the same way same way I wonder what this was and then later I realized it was Sunday but that was one incident I remember another one another Sunday we went out and we went by the turkey farm and there were about a hundred turkeys there in the field and Janet got out of the car and she went gobble gobble gobble and those hundred turkeys answered back gobble gobble gobble and she'd gobble and they'd gobble that was the darndest thing I ever heard that was

18:14.307 --> 18:18.252
flavor of living in College Station at that time.

18:20.695 --> 18:21.656
It was very nice.

18:21.757 --> 18:24.100
We were in the faculty dinner dance club.

18:24.780 --> 18:27.083
I became chairman of that, and I'm real proud.

18:27.224 --> 18:28.745
I stimulated it.

18:29.226 --> 18:33.251
People, you couldn't tell how many people would come, so we sold them season tickets.

18:34.733 --> 18:39.940
Very reasonable price, but if you bought a season ticket, then you're quite likely to come to the monthly affairs.

18:40.881 --> 18:41.682
The faculty

18:42.573 --> 18:48.639
I really was well acquainted and a lot of interchange going on, a very nice place to live, raise children.

18:49.380 --> 18:55.687
Who were your, for you and your wife, who were your closest faculty friends outside the department?

18:57.709 --> 19:00.612
Well, we had a slide group.

19:00.632 --> 19:03.695
Remember, we used to have a lot of colored slides that you'd take pictures.

19:03.735 --> 19:10.082
And then once a month, this group would get together to show their slides.

19:10.298 --> 19:15.187
Marjorie Blank, whose husband was in geology, sort of started this thing.

19:15.207 --> 19:21.940
Dr. Vance and his wife were members of it.

19:22.080 --> 19:30.116
And the tendency seemed to be that the group represented different, not represented, but came from different departments around the campus.

19:30.236 --> 19:32.340
And that was a group of friends that we...

19:32.523 --> 19:33.484
were closest to.

19:33.865 --> 19:38.310
But actually, the administrative wives were amazingly friendly.

19:38.811 --> 19:43.616
When we first arrived, the president's wife and the dean's wife both came to visit us.

19:45.859 --> 19:49.764
Dr. Harrington had found a house through Culpeper's for us, and we didn't take it.

19:52.587 --> 20:00.977
We had a rent house for a while, and then we bought a house on 11th Street, real nice house, $11,000.

20:01.531 --> 20:03.473
and lived there for a while.

20:03.513 --> 20:12.962
But anyhow, through the dance club, those were all different kinds of parts of the college represented.

20:12.982 --> 20:14.423
It was a college then, I guess, still.

20:15.945 --> 20:18.347
And I might say something about that name sometime, too.

20:18.908 --> 20:20.109
Go ahead.

20:21.110 --> 20:26.215
We were a college, and Texas A&M became a university.

20:26.895 --> 20:28.517
The question was, what name should it have?

20:29.290 --> 20:33.375
Well, in the academic council, I proposed the name Texas A&M University.

20:35.118 --> 20:38.602
And I did that because the research foundation had that name.

20:39.283 --> 20:43.068
It was A without a period and M without a period.

20:43.990 --> 20:46.914
It dropped the meaning agricultural and mechanical.

20:47.534 --> 20:49.377
So I proposed that the college be named that.

20:49.497 --> 20:53.623
And I think we got, what was it, 32 votes in the graduate council.

20:53.843 --> 20:55.826
And it kind of died then for eight or nine months.

20:55.866 --> 20:58.369
And then it came back and became a name.

20:59.193 --> 21:00.835
It's used, I think it's a good name.

21:01.916 --> 21:27.462
We received one letter from the Air Force, a once official letter, addressed to us the Department of, let's see, no, A&M College of Agricultural and Meteorology, instead of mechanical, agricultural and meteorologic.

21:28.927 --> 21:30.328
How did I get into that?

21:31.109 --> 21:38.756
No, talking about life here, were your children in schools here, or had they already finished high school?

21:38.776 --> 21:41.419
Oh, they were, no, they were right in the middle of the school system.

21:41.439 --> 21:42.920
So they were in the Indian consolidated schools?

21:43.160 --> 21:43.721
That's correct.

21:44.562 --> 21:50.727
How did you find them in terms of quality compared with what you had encountered in California, the local schools?

21:52.209 --> 21:56.393
Well, we didn't try to compare them, but for our children, they were perfectly satisfactory.

21:56.653 --> 21:58.815
I was a member of the school board for a while.

21:59.673 --> 22:02.397
We knew the teachers, some of the teachers very well.

22:03.298 --> 22:04.680
I think they were very good schools.

22:06.884 --> 22:14.955
Down here on your notes of some single items you have listed as hiring test and diary.

22:15.556 --> 22:16.197
What does that mean?

22:17.399 --> 22:25.130
Well, when I hired people, including some of the ones that brought here from California, I had a 17-question test.

22:25.150 --> 22:27.013
This was eighth grade mathematics.

22:27.820 --> 22:32.225
And I found that that was very indicative of future possibilities.

22:32.446 --> 22:34.608
If you got 15 or more, a good chance.

22:34.768 --> 22:37.191
If you were down around 10, forget it.

22:38.252 --> 22:42.037
It was, oh, if you're at latitude 50 and go 10 degrees north, where are you?

22:42.077 --> 22:43.539
Rather simple.

22:43.559 --> 22:46.062
They do one addition, one subtraction, one long division.

22:46.983 --> 22:47.844
And that was my test.

22:47.944 --> 22:51.048
Not allowed to give it anymore, at least in civil service.

22:53.731 --> 22:57.135
And the other thing, the first year I was here, I kept notes every day.

22:57.858 --> 22:58.939
all the things that happened.

22:59.460 --> 23:08.251
I remember one thing was that I had 125 different interviews with Dr. Jack who took me to people to brief them on what we were doing.

23:09.052 --> 23:09.813
Here on the campus?

23:10.233 --> 23:11.234
No, around the state.

23:11.475 --> 23:12.116
Oh.

23:12.136 --> 23:13.417
Yeah, and the campus, yeah.

23:15.500 --> 23:15.920
Let's see.

23:16.341 --> 23:25.452
In those travels around the state, did you find any hesitation about the

23:25.803 --> 23:31.210
appropriateness of Texas having an oceanography program in this state?

23:31.571 --> 23:33.994
Were there some people who thought that was a waste of money?

23:35.677 --> 23:40.263
Closest thing I can remember to this is the secretary that I hired in the beginning.

23:41.485 --> 23:49.836
It was a custom then professors would often find in their homes rooms they could rent out to college people.

23:50.660 --> 23:55.908
And my secretary got a room in the College of Agriculture professor's home.

23:56.989 --> 23:59.433
And one day he said, Lucy, where do you work?

23:59.954 --> 24:03.018
And she said, I work in the Department of Oceanography.

24:04.040 --> 24:07.705
He said, oh, another one of those fads, it'll be gone in a year.

24:10.990 --> 24:13.273
I guess that answers your question somewhat.

24:15.236 --> 24:20.464
Somewhere I ran into somebody who thought that it was a study of tourism on the beach.

24:21.237 --> 24:29.767
And I told them, no, it was far, far, far beyond that in its importance and so forth.

24:29.787 --> 24:39.117
Now, down through the years, the relations between the department and later then the college and the research foundation remained very close.

24:39.197 --> 24:39.718
Is that right?

24:40.459 --> 24:44.744
Yes, we had a large percentage of the program of the foundation.

24:45.785 --> 24:50.350
Dr. Jack had been much of his hopes for the future on oceanography.

24:52.203 --> 24:55.066
And what was the other part of your question?

24:56.587 --> 25:05.537
Well, after his passing, did the relationship remain strong with the foundation?

25:08.780 --> 25:12.103
His assistant was Judy Davis, and she was there all the way through.

25:13.124 --> 25:16.708
Howard Barlow was dean of engineering who had a kind of a,

25:16.925 --> 25:21.150
close connection with the foundation, was the associate director, maybe something like that.

25:22.752 --> 25:28.760
When Dr. Jackula passed away in 1953, there was considerable worry in the board of directors.

25:29.501 --> 25:34.848
One reason being that they just borrowed $30,000 to put into our new ship.

25:36.210 --> 25:43.459
A year later, Gib Gilchrist, who was the chairman of the board, made a review and he found that things were running fine.

25:43.539 --> 25:45.261
Dr. Jackula's

25:46.473 --> 25:52.741
Ideal, as he often told me, was to be an administrator such that if he were gone, it wouldn't make any difference.

25:54.103 --> 25:57.147
He traveled one week, usually in the office one week.

25:58.329 --> 26:07.922
So the foundation relationship stayed, except we had recommended Archie Kahan to be director, and he became director.

26:08.603 --> 26:12.107
And he changed the philosophy, unfortunately, apparently, at best I could tell.

26:13.029 --> 26:15.552
He was kind of a businessman.

26:16.358 --> 26:22.424
And he found that the thing that impressed the board of directors was the increase in the cash balance.

26:23.405 --> 26:33.495
So instead of putting as much money into the return research programs and helping them, he tried to build up this balance.

26:34.616 --> 26:44.526
Dr. Jack, I remember one time I went in to him and I said, we need to go to some meetings for promotional purposes,

26:44.894 --> 26:46.256
or to gather information.

26:47.338 --> 26:49.862
We cannot charge a sponsored project for any of this.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.546
I need some money without strings attached.

26:52.626 --> 26:53.687
He said, well, how much do you need?

26:53.727 --> 26:55.690
I said, well, about $5,000 a year.

26:56.071 --> 26:58.615
He said, okay, we'll set it up.

26:58.635 --> 27:02.661
But that attitude did not carry over into the later foundation.

27:02.841 --> 27:08.370
As Hugh McClellan wrote in a letter, for some reason the foundation has not been as helpful as it used to be.

27:11.975 --> 27:13.197
Back to administrators.

27:13.970 --> 27:21.181
We don't have very much information about the personality of President and later Chancellor Gilchrist.

27:22.483 --> 27:27.371
Describe him as a person, his values, his attitudes.

27:30.336 --> 27:36.005
I didn't know him so very well, but he was a powerful individual in the state of Texas.

27:36.485 --> 27:40.652
I think he'd been in the highway system and made a big success of that.

27:41.324 --> 27:44.049
He was a big, powerful individual.

27:44.510 --> 27:45.512
Was he big physically?

27:45.532 --> 27:45.773
Yes.

27:46.253 --> 27:49.179
And no nonsense.

27:49.640 --> 27:50.261
No nonsense.

27:51.624 --> 27:56.052
He was friendly, but pretty strictly business.

27:57.655 --> 28:00.060
I think he was fair and active.

28:01.964 --> 28:04.328
He made decisions.

28:05.168 --> 28:06.170
and he stuck with them.

28:07.692 --> 28:12.900
So I think he was a great influence on Texas A&M and the state of Texas.

28:15.043 --> 28:27.362
All right, going back now to the college's leadership, Dr. Byers comes as dean, and then doesn't he move up to be vice president for academic affairs, and who succeeds him?

28:28.344 --> 28:32.290
Yes, of course I wasn't here at that time, but I know that he went

28:32.692 --> 28:35.878
to the vice president's position and did some very good work there.

28:36.740 --> 28:37.722
Who succeeds him?

28:40.226 --> 28:43.092
Well, as I say, I was not here during this period.

28:43.112 --> 28:53.772
After Willis Pecklenow served as head of the department and Richard Geyer came in as head of the department, the deans

28:55.405 --> 28:58.529
I guess Dr. Deuce must have come in about that time.

28:58.589 --> 29:03.394
He was brought from Rhode Island, which is one of the most powerful programs nowadays in oceanography.

29:03.774 --> 29:06.157
And then Geyer moved up to be dean also.

29:07.098 --> 29:08.079
Is that right?

29:08.219 --> 29:08.920
I don't know that.

29:09.140 --> 29:09.781
No.

29:09.861 --> 29:10.322
You left.

29:10.682 --> 29:11.383
When did you leave?

29:11.403 --> 29:14.987
69, 69.

29:16.449 --> 29:19.973
So you leave when Mr. Rutter is still the president?

29:19.993 --> 29:20.333
Yes.

29:21.764 --> 29:23.266
Let's see.

29:25.228 --> 29:29.212
Plans and hopes for the department to tie the sea and air together.

29:30.513 --> 29:34.557
As you look back, do you feel that that was successful?

29:35.939 --> 29:37.440
Up to a point, it sure was.

29:39.162 --> 29:43.667
When I left, we had to make a report to the National Academy of Sciences every year.

29:44.808 --> 29:49.493
At that time, 46% of the department was

29:50.435 --> 29:52.078
oceanography or meteorology.

29:52.098 --> 29:54.622
They put meteorology with oceanography in their reports.

29:55.804 --> 30:00.271
And in addition, there were 10%, which they called sea air interaction.

30:00.512 --> 30:11.210
That gets up to, let's see, 46, I think it was 46, about 50 some percent, which was sea air oriented.

30:11.230 --> 30:15.717
My thought was in the beginning, we need a marine oriented,

30:16.237 --> 30:24.049
program, not only ocean, but meteorology, the weather over the sea, the effect of the sea upon the weather, especially.

30:25.611 --> 30:31.821
And so that was my goal, and I pretty much achieved it by the time I resigned.

30:33.944 --> 30:40.354
Now, what I think happened after that, lacking a statement of

30:40.739 --> 30:44.705
department objectives which would follow through different heads.

30:45.806 --> 30:49.492
Each head that came in sort of warped things his direction.

30:50.894 --> 30:59.967
And the first one was Will Specklenau who probably did not warp it too much but he was biologically oriented and he encouraged that part naturally.

31:00.908 --> 31:03.392
And then came Dick Geyer who was just physically oriented.

31:04.093 --> 31:07.718
Well now that was a big difference in emphasis.

31:08.960 --> 31:09.801
My thought had been

31:11.266 --> 31:18.457
If I want to build up the geological or geophysical, I've got a department of geology and a department of geophysical, get them all involved and they'll do all this.

31:19.499 --> 31:21.883
And all we need is somebody to interact with them.

31:23.085 --> 31:29.455
The same thing with chemistry and well, same thing with physics in a way.

31:29.475 --> 31:36.987
So I had hoped that we could bring the entire college or university into marine work and make it

31:37.237 --> 31:38.098
a marine universe.

31:38.158 --> 31:40.380
And it just about has become that, actually.

31:42.182 --> 31:50.930
So I think that the change in department heads, now Bill Bryant is present.

31:50.971 --> 31:55.515
Department head is a geological oceanographer, petroleum industry in particular.

31:55.895 --> 31:59.619
He was here before I left, so he's been here all through that one.

31:59.639 --> 32:01.100
Worth known was a department head.

32:01.120 --> 32:05.725
He was a physical oceanographer, a different type.
