WEBVTT

00:07.760 --> 00:08.822
Do you want me to read these? Do you want to read 
these? Well, why don't we just start off with when

00:09.583 --> 00:14.110
you did come to Galveston. Okay. And what was the 
background that you came with? All right. I was

00:20.019 --> 00:23.925
employed by the city of Galveston in the fall of 
1977.

00:26.269 --> 00:34.662
I was hired as, I would argue, as part of a reform 
movement, a movement to professionalize city

00:26.269 --> 00:34.662
government in Galveston. Prior to my being there, 
Galveston had not had a history of having

00:36.262 --> 00:43.674
professional planners, trained professional 
planners. Only for a brief period of time, I

00:43.854 --> 00:53.570
believe in 1971, 72, somewhere around that time, 
did they actually have a degreed planner who was on

00:43.854 --> 00:53.570
the staff. That person served for about one year 
and then left. Galveston did have a comprehensive

00:58.378 --> 01:00.321
plan. I believe it was prepared by Marvin 
Springer. And I believe it was done sometime in the

01:03.835 --> 01:06.197
1960s. It

01:06.457 --> 01:12.943
was a typical kind of Springer plan. They also had a 
zoning ordinance. And I'll be happy to send you

01:15.365 --> 01:19.749
something that'll give you some specifics. I can 
look up the dates on that and find out when they did

01:19.769 --> 01:22.131
it. The plan was, of course, very outdated. The 
zoning ordinance was very traditional, standard

01:25.414 --> 01:29.917
kind of ordinance. It had been amended very 
infrequently in the years since it was adopted,

01:33.535 --> 01:40.089
and I'm not sure when it was, but again, I'll look 
that up for you. The city didn't do a systematic

01:40.109 --> 01:43.256
review of its plan. That plan was quite old when I 
saw it. In terms of priorities, updating the plan

01:47.265 --> 01:50.993
was not one of my priorities. Galveston is... 
basically two cities, two distinct cities. One is

01:57.657 --> 02:03.403
the area behind the seawall, and the other is the 
area known as the West End or West Beach. It's

02:04.665 --> 02:07.028
probably divided equally in two in that respect. I 
think the West End is about 16 miles. It is not

02:09.631 --> 02:11.293
behind the seawall. It is an environmentally 
fragile area with dunes, very minimum

02:12.294 --> 02:23.387
topography, probably seven or eight foot maximum 
elevation. a lot of wetland vegetation. And the

02:28.018 --> 02:40.855
predominant pattern of development out there was 
a secondary home market with absentee ownership

02:28.018 --> 02:40.855
for the most part. My perspective was that a 
traditional kind of comprehensive plan was out of

02:40.875 --> 02:47.244
place for Galveston. The built-up part was 
already basically 90%, 95% urbanized. It was an

02:52.751 --> 02:54.133
infill situation. That was not something that 
dictated the need for a comprehensive plan. What

02:58.796 --> 03:05.704
was really needed was neighborhood planning for 
the built-up areas, for the infilling, for

02:58.796 --> 03:05.704
revitalization. And so I committed the 
department to doing neighborhood planning,

03:05.724 --> 03:15.314
although it also was not the number one priority 
that I had when I came. But I recognized that it was a

03:15.354 --> 03:17.276
need. It was something that would be very useful to 
us. So I did commit to having a person on our staff

03:20.239 --> 03:24.103
that would work in that area. There was only one 
staff member in the planning department when I

03:25.777 --> 03:31.824
arrived, and that person was doing zoning 
administration. Planning was under the

03:32.505 --> 03:35.107
Department of Traffic. There was no physical 
planning going on of any kind, no capital

03:35.988 --> 03:43.536
improvements programming, no grant work. It was 
strictly zoning and subdivision

03:43.697 --> 03:47.621
administration. The plan that Springer had and 
the comprehensive plan, had that much of an effect

03:48.502 --> 03:54.428
on Yaxton?

03:57.445 --> 04:02.390
Oh, I suspect that most of the island was developed 
before Springer did his plan. And I would question

04:03.691 --> 04:15.864
whether the plan was as much of a predictor as it was 
as much as a recognizer of what was already there.

04:16.724 --> 04:20.308
So it wasn't a plan that was meant to inspire. It was 
a very typical, ordinary, very simple, in a not

04:27.247 --> 04:29.710
very complex, comprehensive plan. They're very 
suitable for their needs and certainly for their

04:30.050 --> 04:33.934
capabilities. Well, again, I was hired as, again, 
what I would argue is part of this reform movement.

04:39.400 --> 04:46.467
They hired their first professional city manager 
about six months to a year before I came. His name

04:47.748 --> 04:49.050
was Tom Muhlenbeck. He was a graduate from city 
management in the management program at Kansas

04:49.490 --> 04:55.296
University. one of the more recognized programs 
in city management. And he was committed to the

05:00.225 --> 05:05.872
professionalism of the various departments, and 
one of which was planning. So I was brought in as the

05:05.892 --> 05:12.481
head of planning and traffic, and still we're 
leaving planning and traffic together. But the

05:13.082 --> 05:20.592
planning was of such importance at that time, they 
moved me to the head of this department. I built up a

05:20.612 --> 05:23.275
planning staff and brought in I believe, five 
professional planners over the next two-year

05:24.217 --> 05:29.143
period, most of them during the first year. Most of 
them were quite young. In fact, I went to the three

05:32.067 --> 05:45.865
planning schools that I had a great deal of respect 
for to the University of Texas at Austin, Texas

05:32.067 --> 05:45.865
A&M, and Oklahoma University, and hired the top 
graduating students from each program. I went in

05:45.885 --> 05:51.993
and asked the faculty who was number one, and 
that's the student I wanted, and that's who we

05:45.885 --> 05:51.993
hired. I created a good environment. for people 
to, for the students, for the new planters to use

05:54.406 --> 06:06.220
their skills that they learned in school and put 
them to real world usefulness right off the bat

05:54.406 --> 06:06.220
gave them a lot of responsibility, gave them 
authority to go with the responsibility. We put a

06:08.262 --> 06:13.308
major emphasis on environmental planning. There 
had been a complete lack of environmental

06:13.628 --> 06:19.215
planning in the history of the island.

06:24.882 --> 06:27.425
in the urbanization that had taken place. It was a 
classic case of man overcoming nature and

06:27.445 --> 06:44.904
dominating it, showing how they could force 
urbanization into an environmentally sensitive

06:27.445 --> 06:44.904
area and do it with a great deal of unconcern about 
what they were, the ecosystem they were

06:27.445 --> 06:44.904
disturbing.

06:49.028 --> 06:52.712
We received some financial assistance from the 
state and a grant to develop this, what was called

06:54.110 --> 06:59.257
the West End Ecosystem Plan. Ray Quay was the 
environmental planner that I'd hired from the

07:00.799 --> 07:09.650
University of Texas at Austin, who kind of 
spearheaded this effort. We hired Kent Butler

07:10.271 --> 07:15.698
from Texas A&M for a very small sum of money to do a 
study for us. We worked with the Texas Marine

07:17.420 --> 07:19.463
Affairs Council. Galveston at that time had its 
own Marine Affairs Council. that the city council

07:24.991 --> 07:35.546
had appointed probably maybe a year before I came, 
very short lead time before I arrived on the scene

07:24.991 --> 07:35.546
that they had created that group. Harris Kempner 
from the Kempner family was the head of that group

07:36.207 --> 07:50.948
and a big, strong supporter and advocate for 
environmental planning and for some analysis of

07:36.207 --> 07:50.948
what was happening at the port. At that time, there 
was growing interest in deepening the port. And he

07:55.366 --> 07:59.871
was concerned about what impact that would have on 
the environment. Also at that time, the citizens,

08:01.392 --> 08:13.885
or the city council anyway, politicized the 
parking situation on West Beach. Under Texas law,

08:14.105 --> 08:20.412
the beaches have historically been open, open to 
everybody, common ownership, public ownership,

08:14.105 --> 08:20.412
public access to the beaches. Part of the problem 
in Galveston was that this was a very dense urban

08:21.742 --> 08:31.356
area, or certainly close proximity to a very dense 
urban area in the city of Houston. And the

08:31.376 --> 08:35.562
population pressures on the beach were 
overwhelming. We had unbelievable numbers of

08:35.583 --> 08:38.948
vehicles driving on the beaches. And for example, 
during one three-month period in a control area of

08:39.809 --> 08:49.403
about one mile, we logged in almost 150 vehicular 
accidents on the beach. Somewhere around 40 of

08:50.480 --> 08:54.546
those accidents involved pedestrians with 
vehicles. And a number of those accidents

08:55.828 --> 08:58.612
involved vehicles and horses. So it was a very 
unsafe, very hazardous, dangerous situation.

09:07.526 --> 09:14.316
Apparently, there were quite a few professionals 
hired into the city yourself, the city manager and

09:07.526 --> 09:14.316
such. What was the impetus to bring that about all 
at once in Galveston? I know that any place

09:20.348 --> 09:24.492
politically has cycles and goes through swings. 
Galveston was going through an enlightened

09:25.353 --> 09:32.381
period where they felt they needed more 
sophisticated government. There was a great deal

09:32.401 --> 09:35.084
of dissatisfaction with the government. There 
had historically been a great deal of

09:35.124 --> 09:38.007
dissatisfaction. Galveston was very political. 
They were one of the last cities, if not the last

09:40.229 --> 09:48.718
city in the country, to do away with electing 
department heads at large elections for. You

09:49.019 --> 09:53.344
know, your planning director, your director of 
traffic, director of public works, police chief,

09:49.019 --> 09:53.344
fire chief. I believe up until darn near the late 
50s, if I'm correct, they were electing these

09:53.364 --> 10:02.957
department heads. Part of that reform movement 
that took place then, I guess, resurfaced and was

10:02.977 --> 10:10.586
trying to professionalize local government. And 
Muhlenbeck was committed to that. The council

10:12.509 --> 10:16.714
was, for the majority, committed to doing that. 
And I think the community wanted it. So that's the

10:19.534 --> 10:22.837
impetus behind this thing. We did 
professionalize. We did bring in very competent,

10:23.978 --> 10:26.480
quality people. We dealt with, I'll read through 
here, some things that we did in the two-year

10:27.201 --> 10:34.027
period from 77 to 79. We completed this beach and 
dune management plan for Galveston Island that

10:34.908 --> 10:41.434
was part of the West End ecosystem plan. That was a 
major component of it. produced a West Beach

10:45.365 --> 10:53.135
access and parking plan that provided the 
planning basis and the ordinances for closing off

10:45.365 --> 10:53.135
the beaches to vehicular traffic. And that became 
the first time in the history of Texas that any part

10:54.016 --> 11:01.045
of the beach had been closed off to vehicular 
traffic. So that was very innovative, very

11:01.665 --> 11:04.349
controversial. It got the Attorney General's 
office involved in it, Senator Ray Swartz with

11:05.090 --> 11:13.380
the, I can't remember what his committee was that 
he was with, I held hearings on that. We had

11:16.073 --> 11:22.099
something in Texas Monthly to the effect that what 
we have done is taken a precious resource away from

11:16.073 --> 11:22.099
the public. We were denying the public access to 
the beaches. In reality, we were trying to correct

11:24.701 --> 11:30.627
a very serious incompatibility problem between 
pedestrians and vehicles. No city, no urban area

11:31.908 --> 11:38.934
in Texas would allow a major road to go through 
their park system where their kids are playing.

11:38.994 --> 11:40.836
And that's, in essence, what that West End of the 
Island was. That's a park system. We had other

11:43.448 --> 11:44.229
problems. It was a very complex issue. But anyway, 
we did treat those. For the first time, the

11:48.694 --> 11:51.898
planning department produced a capital 
improvements program. It was the 1978-1983

11:52.099 --> 11:57.465
capital improvements program. It was a 
legitimate, true, comprehensive capital

11:57.946 --> 12:01.731
improvement program. We established 
priorities. We looked at available funding

12:06.016 --> 12:07.598
sources. We analyzed the financing capabilities 
of the community. a good citizen participation

12:12.305 --> 12:15.890
process to kind of help us in picking priorities. 
The planning commission provided great

12:16.291 --> 12:22.700
leadership in developing that plan, and it was 
adopted by the city council. In fact, during this

12:22.961 --> 12:37.582
two-year period of time, the planning commission 
was the entity providing this critical

12:22.961 --> 12:37.582
leadership that we needed to make these very 
important planning projects come forward. They

12:38.423 --> 12:41.788
were strong leaders, excellent advocates, And 
they were really the force behind the force. The

12:46.974 --> 12:54.625
city council was not that aggressive, was not that 
supportive, very nervous as to what they were

12:46.974 --> 12:54.625
doing. Many of the things that were done during 
this two-year period that I'll continue reading

12:55.186 --> 13:02.216
were done on split votes in the face of substantial 
opposition. I can remember one of our proposals

13:02.677 --> 13:06.403
was to create neighborhood planning 
commissions. I'm not aware of any city in Texas

13:08.145 --> 13:11.370
that has done that. We felt it was important 
because of my desire to do neighborhood planning

13:12.025 --> 13:16.992
in the redevelopment areas. We felt it was 
important to use neighborhood planning

13:17.592 --> 13:28.467
commissions because that was going to give us a 
built-in group that would help coordinate the

13:17.592 --> 13:28.467
plan and participate directly in preparing the 
plan for each of these neighborhoods. We also were

13:29.288 --> 13:41.104
starting, we had the community development block 
grant program that was expanding and the attempt

13:29.288 --> 13:41.104
was going to be made to let the neighborhoods have a 
better, have more important, have a bigger role in

13:41.624 --> 13:45.007
determining the priorities and how those funds 
would be spent in their neighborhoods. The

13:45.027 --> 13:47.769
Planning Commission supported this concept 
100%. They did not see it as an infringement on

13:48.170 --> 13:51.412
their commission rules. They were happy to share 
it. They were happy to get this kind of

13:52.994 --> 13:56.076
participation. The City Council had a tied vote on 
whether or not to do this. It was three to three,

14:00.540 --> 14:03.302
with one member absent. The member who was absent 
was a very strong advocate of neighborhood

14:03.883 --> 14:08.126
planning commissions. When he returned the next 
week, the vote was It failed by four to three

14:11.662 --> 14:22.100
instead of passing by four to three because the 
mayor, Mayor Unbehagen, changed his vote from

14:11.662 --> 14:22.100
being for it to being against it. So it did fail four 
to three. The leading advocate for defeating this

14:24.865 --> 14:30.936
movement was the city attorney, Bob Shattuck. 
Bob's view was that the neighborhood planning

14:31.838 --> 14:34.362
commission would end up usurping the authority of 
the city council. It would end up putting

14:39.100 --> 14:51.694
constraints on the council because it would be 
very difficult for the council to use their

14:39.100 --> 14:51.694
judgment or substitute their judgment in 
neighborhood matters for the judgment of that

14:39.100 --> 14:51.694
neighborhood commission. So for that, he 
cautioned the council that this was a weakening of

14:51.714 --> 14:55.378
their authority and their power. And he advised 
them against doing that. And he finally ended up

14:57.440 --> 15:03.066
winning the day in that area. When I arrived in 
Galveston, their zoning ordinance, which was

15:04.210 --> 15:10.957
quite old, was in various folders in files. It was 
not all put together. One of the first things I did

15:14.621 --> 15:20.928
was bring it all together and put it into a one 
common book there where it could be kept current.

15:21.369 --> 15:27.495
They made copies of it so the public could have 
access to it.

15:27.876 --> 15:33.542
The last year, toward the last year that I was 
there, we developed a performance,

15:27.876 --> 15:33.542
productivity, budgeting system. That was 
something I was very strongly supportive of. I was

15:39.606 --> 16:03.698
proposing to do something like the City of Dayton 
had done, where the idea was to get a sense of

15:39.606 --> 16:03.698
direction for the community, understand what we 
were trying to achieve on the basis of some kind of

15:39.606 --> 16:03.698
plans, and see that the budget's instruments were 
used as a device for implementing the plan, rather

15:39.606 --> 16:03.698
than the budget being the objective, having the 
budget used as a planning device for implementing

16:04.589 --> 16:08.677
council objectives. So I proposed going to this 
program performance budget. We had a line on a very

16:12.824 --> 16:19.516
traditional, antiquated kind of budgeting 
system when I was there. I didn't have much support

16:19.537 --> 16:20.739
for that. However, after about a year, a Backlash, 
I'd say a continuing backlash, because basically

16:26.172 --> 16:35.001
government had not demonstrated to the citizens 
of Galveston that it was responsive to them. It was

16:35.161 --> 16:36.563
tremendous dissatisfaction. Year in, year out, 
the people in the council were turned out of

16:37.604 --> 16:41.328
office. It was just, you served one term and you 
were gone. The voters were not satisfied with the

16:44.611 --> 16:48.755
services they were receiving. Well, finally, 
this thing, the backlash was so substantial that

16:53.594 --> 16:57.297
they passed a freeze, a rollback on taxes. It was a 
charter amendment that, in essence, rolled back

16:57.337 --> 17:05.425
taxes and froze the taxing level and the amount of 
money that could be raised on taxes in any given

16:57.337 --> 17:05.425
year. Even put libs on revenue so that we couldn't 
even, in theory, bring in federal grants, if you

17:05.925 --> 17:17.536
read that charter amendment

17:05.925 --> 17:17.536
with preciseness. The manager's view was we 
shouldn't fight this. We should let the citizen

17:21.559 --> 17:23.601
groups you know, argument themselves. So we 
didn't participate. We didn't even give them

17:27.520 --> 17:30.423
information, which I thought was a mistake. The 
manager's view was that he didn't want to be in a

17:31.285 --> 17:42.920
situation such as in California where the 
employees all said this was bad, you can't do it,

17:31.285 --> 17:42.920
and then when it passes, turn around and do it, you 
know, and say, well, what happened? You said we

17:42.940 --> 17:44.442
were going to lose this and this and this. Why 
didn't we? So he didn't want to suffer from that

17:45.484 --> 17:47.727
credibility problem. So we didn't campaign. We 
didn't participate. And this charter meeting was

17:50.871 --> 17:53.875
overwhelmingly passed. And I believe in the first 
year, it was going to necessitate a 25% to 30% cut in

17:54.462 --> 18:04.237
the budget immediately right off the top. And it 
was going to require additional cuts in years

18:04.837 --> 18:08.363
beyond that because of the way it was phasing in. So 
in order to get a handle on the budget and how to make

18:10.286 --> 18:23.305
cuts, the manager accepted my year earlier 
suggestion that they go to this productivity

18:10.286 --> 18:23.305
management by objective kind of approach. to 
making decisions. And we went to a citywide survey

18:25.359 --> 18:32.309
where all the citizens in Galveston were asked to 
assess the various services that they were

18:25.359 --> 18:32.309
receiving. They were asked to assess the quality 
of those services. And then they were asked to

18:35.574 --> 18:44.847
indicate whether or not they favored an increase 
or a decrease in those services, and what was the

18:35.574 --> 18:44.847
magnitude of the decrease that they favored. We 
had pretty good turnout. I believe it was 10%, 12%

18:45.929 --> 18:50.796
of the citizens across the island that returned 
our survey. That was used. in giving guidance to

18:52.664 --> 18:56.749
the city council and selecting priorities for 
making the budget cuts. So I was pleased to see us

18:57.850 --> 19:11.687
going to that system, although, of course, I was 
disappointed that it required the circumstance,

18:57.850 --> 19:11.687
the painful experience, the budgetary 
experience to make us go to that kind of system.

19:11.707 --> 19:16.553
What's interesting about that is that that system 
is no longer used today. That was retained. I left

19:18.475 --> 19:19.536
after two years. The manager continued that. for 
about another year after I left, and then that

19:21.757 --> 19:24.903
manager left. And the new city manager, the 
current city manager, Steve Huffman, does not use

19:24.923 --> 19:29.912
that budgeting system anymore.

19:33.218 --> 19:36.705
We started the first of the neighborhood planning 
programs. It was the East End Neighborhood Plan.

19:38.949 --> 19:42.195
We surveyed the neighborhood with mailbox and 
personal visits to everybody, mail cards in the

19:42.800 --> 19:46.045
mail. We got about a 10% response to our survey. We 
asked him to identify issues, problems,

19:48.749 --> 19:54.597
priorities, the typical kinds of information you 
need to do a neighborhood plan. We attempted to

19:55.759 --> 20:04.611
create an advisory group without the appointed 
powers of the city council, without the council

19:55.759 --> 20:04.611
appointing them because that had been rejected by 
the council. And we did identify issues and we

20:05.673 --> 20:07.896
prepared position papers and had a lot of 
documentation for resolving those issues for at

20:08.247 --> 20:16.199
least presenting alternatives for resolution of 
those issues when I left. About a year after I left,

20:16.940 --> 20:23.570
I would probably say, 80 or late 80, the first 
neighborhood plan was produced. I believe now

20:23.590 --> 20:27.876
they have completed two or three other 
neighborhood plans in the last several years.

20:28.885 --> 20:39.444
What's interesting about that, too, is now the 
current city planning director, Roger Hendrick,

20:28.885 --> 20:39.444
who replaced me, is gearing up to do a 
comprehensive plan. His view is, at this point,

20:39.825 --> 20:43.752
they have a need for a comprehensive plan. My view 
was that comprehensive plan wasn't needed in the

20:44.173 --> 20:48.801
built-up area. And that it was going to be very 
difficult to produce a comprehensive plan for the

20:49.220 --> 21:02.937
west end of the island because its shape was so 
narrow and the environmental factors were so

20:49.220 --> 21:02.937
significant that I thought a performance 
management system was far better. And that's what

21:03.017 --> 21:11.667
we were attempting to do with this West End 
Ecosystem Plan with developing these

21:03.017 --> 21:11.667
performance criteria and standards for urban 
development. And I felt that was the way to go with

21:12.338 --> 21:27.613
each development being reviewed through a 
specific use permit or PUD kind of regulatory

21:12.338 --> 21:27.613
process, as opposed to a general plan with 
specific zoning districts that would allow uses

21:27.982 --> 21:49.602
by right and standard setbacks i didn't feel there 
was anything in the west end of the island that

21:27.982 --> 21:49.602
allowed a standardization and uniformity with 
with respect to the treatment development i

21:27.982 --> 21:49.602
thought each area was uniquely different and 
sensitive and therefore the comprehensive

21:27.982 --> 21:49.602
planning approach would have been the wrong 
approach to use roger just disagrees with me on

21:27.982 --> 21:49.602
that Is it the different opinion of two 
professionals, or is it more the situation of

21:49.987 --> 22:02.387
Galveston has changed and it's becoming more so 
appropriate for... I think it's a difference in

22:02.407 --> 22:05.492
the professionals' views.

22:08.217 --> 22:10.180
I think Roger and I are just different in that 
respect. We have a very similar background,

22:10.200 --> 22:13.345
but... He sincerely believes that you can do a 
comprehensive plan for that wisdom of the island,

22:15.198 --> 22:20.004
a meaningful plan. And I could not get a handle on 
it. I'm basically used to doing my own

22:23.369 --> 22:25.511
comprehensive plans. And I have done a number. And 
in that situation, I could not see how I would

22:27.454 --> 22:30.978
approach it. It looked to me like it required a 
great deal of site-specific analysis. And that

22:36.766 --> 22:40.070
does not lend itself to a comprehensive approach 
to planning. Roger disagrees. And what is

22:42.738 --> 22:47.083
interesting about this, though, he proposed to 
hire consultants to do this. So if there's a

22:48.765 --> 22:54.752
changed circumstance there, he has money that I 
did not have, because we were a very poor

22:48.765 --> 22:54.752
department when I was there. We reformed the way we 
did zoning reports while I was there. I introduced

22:59.097 --> 23:07.928
a very standardized format based on the old ASPO 
report entitled Writing Better Zoning Reports.

23:08.188 --> 23:11.332
It's a PAS study, a PAS report. And it was an attempt 
to get a little bit more professionalism into the

23:12.978 --> 23:16.744
zoning evaluation process. It was very well 
received. The planning commission was

23:19.167 --> 23:20.910
outstanding. Carolyn Stiles was the chairman 
during the last year I was there. Jules Love was

23:24.895 --> 23:27.099
chairman during the first year. Carolyn Stiles 
may be one of the most outstanding citizen

23:27.319 --> 23:31.966
planners there ever was. Just a very dedicated, 
enthusiastic individual. very aggressive, very

23:38.290 --> 23:52.828
active, who had some political clout behind the 
scenes, along with some other people on our

23:38.290 --> 23:52.828
commission, and made it possible for us to do a 
large number of things in a very short period of

23:38.290 --> 23:52.828
time here as I'm continuing to go through. I think 
if you sum up in this when I finish, you're going to

23:52.868 --> 24:03.741
see, gosh, in two years, coming in with no staff, 
and the one staff person that was there during the

23:52.868 --> 24:03.741
zoning administration left very shortly, After I 
got there to go to law school as part of his career

24:04.328 --> 24:09.375
plans, his wife was a medical student. He'd been 
planning to leave, and she graduated, and she

24:09.395 --> 24:13.000
graduated, and he left. So we built the staff for 
nothing. We had literally no materials in our

24:14.502 --> 24:18.208
offices. We didn't have any census materials. We 
had no planning publications. Nothing relating

24:22.053 --> 24:32.648
to planning was in that planning office, not a 
document, except for several copies of the old

24:22.053 --> 24:32.648
comprehensive plan that just happened to have 
been preserved for some reason. We did some areas

24:38.347 --> 24:41.189
and some things with respect to the historic 
district. Galveston had two historical

24:42.090 --> 24:45.173
districts that had been created in the early 70s. 
Most people think of Galveston as being a classic

24:45.894 --> 24:52.800
example of historical preservation and 
successful efforts in historical preservation.

24:53.421 --> 24:57.044
It's very beneficial to the economy, a 
significant contributor to the economy. What's

24:57.685 --> 25:01.268
particularly interesting about it, though, is at 
the time I was there, The community, in general,

25:01.450 --> 25:04.915
was not supportive of historical preservation. 
And the city council was even anti-historical

25:05.536 --> 25:09.562
preservation. The worst thing one could do at that 
time was to suggest something involving

25:09.582 --> 25:14.309
historical preservation. They were completely 
turned off by it and sensitive to it. I think that

25:19.336 --> 25:26.527
just had to do with the

25:19.336 --> 25:26.527
unique culture of Galveston. Galveston is a 
unique place. Every place is unique, but

25:28.350 --> 25:30.613
Galveston is definitely unique. The attitude in 
the island there of the average citizen,

25:31.572 --> 25:51.096
certainly the elected officials, and I think they 
did a pretty good job of representing the citizens

25:31.572 --> 25:51.096
in this area, was that historical preservation 
was elitism, was for some kind of upper crust

25:31.572 --> 25:51.096
visitor. They basically took it for granted. They 
didn't see anything special about those

25:54.680 --> 25:57.403
buildings. It was just a rare combination of the 
right people in the right time and the right events

26:01.289 --> 26:09.820
that even made it possible for them to get that 
historical district established, those two

26:01.289 --> 26:09.820
districts in the early 70s. When I attempted to 
expand the districts, I was completely rejected.

26:12.603 --> 26:15.106
That was one area I could make no progress in 
whatsoever. We had a landmark commission that was

26:15.967 --> 26:23.517
grappling for help, didn't know how to respond to 
the issues of new construction in our districts. I

26:24.638 --> 26:30.385
was able to get a grant from the state of Texas 
Historical Commission, and we hired Ellen

26:24.638 --> 26:30.385
Beasley just before I left. my second year to do a 
manual for guidelines for new construction that

26:31.158 --> 26:37.123
was produced about a year after I left. That was 
extremely beneficial to the Landmark Commission

26:37.704 --> 26:46.792
because they did have a difficult time in 
assessing these new construction projects and

26:37.704 --> 26:46.792
trying to protect historical areas. I was able to 
promote a historical district signage program

26:47.693 --> 26:59.123
where we posted signs up in the city letting 
visitors, tourists know where the districts were

26:47.693 --> 26:59.123
and also putting in street signs in the district 
that were different color, uniquely different,

26:59.626 --> 27:07.697
so that the residents would know about it and 
anybody else who wandered through that

26:59.626 --> 27:07.697
neighborhood would know about it. I wanted, 
therefore, a psychological value, an

27:08.658 --> 27:18.010
educational value, a warning value in the sense 
that you couldn't do anything in the historic

27:08.658 --> 27:18.010
district without permits from the city. You 
couldn't paint your porch. You couldn't replace

27:19.732 --> 27:20.874
railing. The city had very restrictive 
regulations in the historic district, and people

27:21.315 --> 27:24.739
didn't know about that. And that was always the 
story we were getting. So we felt like by putting in

27:27.665 --> 27:38.338
these signs saying, here are these districts, and 
then changing the street signs and putting in

27:27.665 --> 27:38.338
these brown signs with special symbols on them and 
logos, that people would figure out there was,

27:27.665 --> 27:38.338
hey, something's going on here. And we could use it 
as part of our educational campaign. At that time,

27:43.164 --> 27:50.372
we were working with Peter Brink in the Galveston 
Historical Foundation. He was the executive

27:50.432 --> 27:52.054
director. We were working with him on the Strand 
and what we could do to help them in the way traffic

27:55.651 --> 27:59.855
circulation, various kinds of grants and 
consultants came in. The foundations were very

28:00.495 --> 28:03.278
interested in helping out the strand. The Harris 
Foundation, the Kempners, the Moody Trust, all of

28:04.299 --> 28:15.288
these groups were very interested in doing 
something to encourage economic development and

28:04.299 --> 28:15.288
to preserve the kind of heritage of Galveston at 
the same time. Pete Fredrickson was on our

28:16.109 --> 28:20.032
planning commission. He was a city councilman who 
also served as ex-officio on our planning

28:21.093 --> 28:25.557
commission. And he was one of the individuals who 
was working on restoration of the Alissa, which is

28:26.161 --> 28:34.173
a sailing ship that's in Galveston now. And he 
worked very diligently with other people to bring

28:34.193 --> 28:45.790
that about, with Polly Guido and some other folks, 
to try to build on Galveston's unique culture and

28:34.193 --> 28:45.790
heritage. rewarding for the staff that we had in 
our offices to be able to work with these kind of

28:46.495 --> 28:51.683
people, the local groups. We did find groups with 
specialized interests that were extremely

28:51.703 --> 29:00.856
helpful to us, giving us technical assistance, 
giving us behind-the-scenes political clout.

29:01.597 --> 29:03.800
And I have to admit, I was naive in that respect. I 
really didn't know how many of the ideas I was

29:03.920 --> 29:16.198
floating, our staff was floating, that were 
legitimately good ideas that were winning on

29:03.920 --> 29:16.198
their own merits versus how many were being sold by 
these supporters and advocates for us. But I do

29:16.533 --> 29:22.682
know that we had tremendous support from a number 
of very influential special interest groups. And

29:23.543 --> 29:25.506
they were very active people. And when I go back to 
Galveston today, I run into them. And they

29:28.050 --> 29:30.293
remembered what we did during those couple of 
years. And the political climate has changed. And

29:33.518 --> 29:35.140
Roger can't do those. The planning director at 
Galveston couldn't do Very many of the things that

29:38.420 --> 29:41.023
we were able to do in the two years I was there. I 
happened to be there at the right time for really

29:41.123 --> 29:46.390
being able to have significant impact. We had an 
energy conservation demonstration program. We

29:50.935 --> 29:55.060
were one of 17 cities that received a grant from the 
state of Texas. We produced an energy

29:55.501 --> 30:04.191
conservation handbook designed for the East End 
Historic District, for our neighborhood, one of

29:55.501 --> 30:04.191
our specific neighborhoods. There's a lot of 
material around on energy conservation, but we

30:04.340 --> 30:13.434
wanted something designed just for Galveston 
Island, just for our own geographic area. Plus, we

30:13.874 --> 30:23.949
needed something designed for the unique kinds of 
housing we had on Galveston Island, especially

30:13.874 --> 30:23.949
with all the historical property that we had, the 
very older structures. So we produced a very

30:23.969 --> 30:30.599
specialized document, ideally designed and 
trained and suited for Galveston. We also

30:30.619 --> 30:32.322
produced a number of workshops where we gave 
residents hands-on experience, got them to come

30:32.943 --> 30:41.354
in and learn how to do various things, how to make 
their houses more energy efficient. It was

30:41.394 --> 30:50.265
particularly important because some of the older 
houses, contrary to public perception about how

30:41.394 --> 30:50.265
energy efficient these older homes are, are 
extremely inefficient. So it was important to be

30:50.285 --> 31:01.279
able to show them how to make these houses more 
energy efficient without losing historical

30:50.285 --> 31:01.279
character, and therefore making it possible for 
them to afford to live in those units instead of

30:50.285 --> 31:01.279
being driven out. We processed grants from the 
state, from the Coastal Energy Impact Program. We

31:09.625 --> 31:11.067
were able to bring in several grants. I wish I could 
remember what all they were. One of them was for

31:14.250 --> 31:21.298
purchasing parkland along the west end of the 
island before it was developed so we'd have public

31:14.250 --> 31:21.298
access to the beaches. Part of it was used in our 
parking program where we were trying to move

31:21.378 --> 31:28.526
vehicles off the beaches and put them into 
designated parking areas. We did an oil and gas

31:30.428 --> 31:32.110
master plan. At the time we were there, the 
drilling for oil and gas became very

31:32.427 --> 31:36.292
controversial. Galveston did not have 
regulations that prohibited drilling for oil and

31:36.332 --> 31:42.440
gas on most of the island. Parts of the built-up 
area were protected, but vast areas were not. The

31:46.285 --> 31:50.750
environmentally sensitive areas were not, and 
offshore drilling was not regulated. So we worked

31:50.770 --> 31:55.016
with a couple of the citizen groups that were very 
interested in doing this. They had enough

31:56.257 --> 32:02.265
pressure, enough influence that they were able to 
make, and the council wasn't interested in this

31:56.257 --> 32:02.265
emergency, They were able to make the council call 
an election to put a charter provision requiring

32:02.768 --> 32:16.121
the preparation of an oil and gas master plan and 
the regulation of drilling and requiring voter

32:02.768 --> 32:16.121
approval of that plan. And we did that. We prepared 
a plan. The first plan, I'm thinking maybe the

32:19.545 --> 32:22.588
first plan did not pass. The second plan was 
approved by the voters. And we did come up with some

32:26.251 --> 32:28.894
very fine regulations. controlling the drilling 
for oil and gas. And at that time, I also served as

32:30.617 --> 32:37.427
the petroleum superintendent, in addition to 
being the director of planning and traffic. The

32:38.188 --> 32:48.003
major concern or fear was that, on offshore 
drilling, that there might be a mishap or an

32:38.188 --> 32:48.003
accident, and that a spill might wash ashore and 
ruin the beaches. And Galveston depends so

32:48.043 --> 32:50.967
heavily on beaches and tourism. that that would 
have been devastating to the local economy. So one

32:53.613 --> 33:04.829
of the provisions in our plan was to limit the 
seasonal drilling so that if the spill took place,

32:53.613 --> 33:04.829
it would do it at the right time of the year when 
prevailing winds would take it away and you'd have

32:53.613 --> 33:04.829
a chance to recover, et cetera. So we did actually 
produce a plan called an oil and gas master plan. We

33:08.455 --> 33:15.144
produced ordinances that were both approved by 
the voters and adopted by the city council. We

33:15.164 --> 33:19.190
attempted to do some things in the area of 
beautification. There was growing interest in

33:19.370 --> 33:20.532
that. improving the physical appearance of the 
island. There was an awareness that the island was

33:23.358 --> 33:26.624
not as pretty as it could be. And in many respects, 
it's extremely degrading what has been done with

33:26.644 --> 33:34.900
urbanization, that concrete seawall. We did come 
up with some beautification plans for the

33:35.481 --> 33:38.166
seawall. Rogers continued and expanded on those 
beautification plans. They involved planters.

33:43.373 --> 33:54.188
We attempted to landscape one of the parking lanes 
on the seawall for some area and put some fill in

33:43.373 --> 33:54.188
dirt and grass on top of that concrete seawall in 
certain places. And we worked with the Corps. We

33:55.470 --> 33:57.312
were able to get that through the Corps and the 
county. It was very difficult, but finally we were

33:57.332 --> 33:59.976
able to convince them to do that. But I think it was 
probably the merchants more than anybody that

34:06.108 --> 34:11.196
kept us from putting that landscaping in and 
really doing something that would have been

34:06.108 --> 34:11.196
beneficial. Also, the traffic engineer that 
worked under me at that time was not supportive of

34:11.216 --> 34:21.152
these efforts and was more interested in moving 
traffic along the seawall than he was in

34:11.216 --> 34:21.152
beautifying it. And he was a behind-the-scenes 
person who worked to stop us from doing these

34:21.172 --> 34:26.981
things. I attempted to take truck parking off of 
Seawall Boulevard at that time and got some

34:27.441 --> 34:33.651
support, but when it really came down to it, The 
council voted without any public discussion,

34:34.120 --> 34:37.806
voted and rejected unanimously. So I never did 
understand the politics of that. But I know there

34:40.390 --> 34:42.813
was some behind the scenes maneuvering on that. It 
was a very valid concept to remove those trucks up

34:43.294 --> 34:50.966
there when they were parking on the seawall in 
front of restaurants and motels and hotels. It was

34:50.986 --> 34:55.673
literally blocking off the view for hundreds and 
hundreds of feet. For the people who were in the

34:56.108 --> 35:04.360
restaurants and motels and hotels and the windows 
who were living there, who were staying there with

34:56.108 --> 35:04.360
the idea of seeing, you know, experiencing 
Galveston. All they were experiencing was the

35:04.380 --> 35:08.525
sight of a refrigerated truck or moving truck or 
something. Try to establish a traffic diverter

35:10.608 --> 35:12.992
program in the neighborhoods. Galveston has a 
grid system, street system. Every street's a

35:15.135 --> 35:16.076
thoroughfare. In particular, around the medical 
center. There's a problem with all the

35:18.670 --> 35:20.613
thoroughfare streets. And the medical center is 
close to the port. So we were getting heavy truck

35:22.896 --> 35:30.267
traffic, a lot of medical center traffic, student 
traffic, faculty traffic through our

35:22.896 --> 35:30.267
residential neighborhoods. And it was a serious 
parking problem because the university wasn't

35:30.287 --> 35:35.915
providing the parking that they should have been 
doing. So I attempted to come up with a traffic

35:35.935 --> 35:41.143
diverter program where the streets would not 
intersect through. There would be a diagonal

35:41.163 --> 35:43.426
divider, a landscape divider. And you would have 
to make a turn to be able to move. That is something

35:47.780 --> 35:49.982
that also failed. On a split vote, the traffic 
commission was opposed to it. We got the

35:52.725 --> 35:54.607
neighborhoods to support it. We were going to put 
our first one in over by an elementary school,

35:54.627 --> 35:59.352
which would have been extremely valuable to do. 
But the traffic engineer fought us tooth and nail.

36:02.895 --> 36:03.936
He strung that out. And I left before I was able to 
get that issue up to the council. I don't believe

36:07.280 --> 36:12.325
they ever followed through with

36:07.280 --> 36:12.325
it. I spent a lot of time educating the planning 
commission. We spent good money, good to city

36:16.400 --> 36:27.294
money, sending our commissioners to 
conferences, to short courses, signing them up as

36:16.400 --> 36:27.294
members of the American Planning Association, 
seeing they got publications. I put on a number of

36:27.914 --> 36:29.637
workshops for them. I gave them a notebook that was 
prepared by me based on some materials I had

36:29.997 --> 36:39.589
previously written, plus some other written 
information that other planners had done that I

36:40.244 --> 36:49.059
retyped, giving proper credit to the people that 
did it, put it in a notebook format, and gave it to

36:40.244 --> 36:49.059
our commissioners. It was probably a 15-chapter 
notebook. It was a handbook for planning

36:52.104 --> 36:54.748
commissioners is what it was entitled. And it was 
on such things as introduction to comp, to

36:55.790 --> 37:04.665
planning, introduction to the planning 
commission,

36:55.790 --> 37:04.665
sign regulations, I'm trying to remember some of 
the other chapters. Gosh, this is horrible. I'm

37:09.930 --> 37:12.092
trying to blank on this. Introduction to the 
Community Development Block Grant Program.

37:17.398 --> 37:20.902
Basic rudimentary kinds of planning 
information. The principles, concepts, and

37:21.542 --> 37:26.448
standards for residential development, for 
commercial development. Just basic rudimentary

37:26.468 --> 37:31.113
studies. I tried to do for them in two years what you 
would to a graduate planning student. Of course, I

37:36.693 --> 37:37.914
didn't have near the time. But we attempted to have 
a workshop at least once a month where there was no

37:38.315 --> 37:48.147
regulation, no current planning being 
conducted, strictly educational session, study

37:38.315 --> 37:48.147
session. I felt it was extremely important to 
raise their level of knowledge and expertise. I

37:53.954 --> 37:55.516
knew I wasn't going to be there forever. I knew our 
staff, which was very young and aggressive, very

37:55.536 --> 38:01.544
confident, was not going to be there in future 
years. So I wanted to leave a presence behind a

38:04.298 --> 38:07.722
strong supporting presence for planning. And so I 
put a lot of my time and energy in building up the

38:07.743 --> 38:15.633
knowledge and the capability of that planning 
commission. And I think that that was probably as

38:15.653 --> 38:23.944
responsible and as much responsible for our 
eventual successes there in the latter year that I

38:15.653 --> 38:23.944
was there as much as anything. The commission came 
alive, was excited about planning, was

38:23.964 --> 38:29.611
enthusiastic about it. They looked forward to 
those workshop sessions. They put tremendous

38:31.554 --> 38:33.276
pressure on staff to come forward with new and 
aggressive and innovative ideas. One of the

38:37.682 --> 38:40.364
subjects they brought up was the landscaping 
ordinance. We talked about beautification. We

38:41.866 --> 38:57.360
did pass landscaping orders requiring that 
parking lots be landscaped, requiring that

38:41.866 --> 38:57.360
peripheral boundaries be landscaped, requiring 
that development on certain major streets on the

38:41.866 --> 38:57.360
island be landscaped for aesthetic reasons, 100% 
purely aesthetics. Very successful. A lot of

39:01.538 --> 39:22.673
these things don't sound very significant to you, 
but if you'd understand that we started from zero,

39:01.538 --> 39:22.673
no support for planning, no support for 
regulation, very conservative kind of

39:01.538 --> 39:22.673
community, to think that you could go in there and 
accomplish and impose these kinds of restrictive

39:01.538 --> 39:22.673
standards and regulations and do these things in a 
planning area, you know, it's just astonishing to

39:01.538 --> 39:22.673
people. At the same time, we were interested in 
landscaping. was a group interested in doing

39:26.767 --> 39:29.350
something about billboard regulations. Now, the 
challenge of that was that the chairman of the

39:30.351 --> 39:35.896
planning commission, Jules Love, owned the local 
sign company. So the council appointed a

39:37.158 --> 39:42.223
subcommittee. And Jules was on that subcommittee 
along with several other people. And they

39:45.086 --> 39:47.088
produced a report and got it back to the 
commission. And it was a good report. It had some

39:50.171 --> 39:51.353
good recommendations. But when it got to the 
commission, it had been watered down a little bit

39:51.393 --> 39:55.056
by Jules. But when it got to the commission, 
Carolyn Stiles, in particular, was able to take

39:57.698 --> 40:14.538
that and really expand it and go beyond the basic 
minimum regulations to something much greater

39:57.698 --> 40:14.538
than that, even taking down existing billboards 
and freezing the number that were there and coming

39:57.698 --> 40:14.538
up with some simplistic kinds of trade-offs. If 
you want this, you take two down. If you want this,

40:16.020 --> 40:17.281
you do something else. And that was very 
successful, in my view. It was good support for

40:20.685 --> 40:21.786
that. We were able to do that, get those changes. 
Oh, in the area of energy conservation, one of the

40:28.411 --> 40:46.030
things I forgot to mention was we instituted an 
energy audit program where our city staff would go

40:28.411 --> 40:46.030
out and audit houses and give people an idea of what 
they could do to make their houses energy

40:28.411 --> 40:46.030
efficient, give them kind of a printout. We 
designed these things to give a printout to them,

40:46.050 --> 40:54.840
showing them what could be done in the order of 
priority that would pay for itself and what would

40:46.050 --> 40:54.840
be the payout to do that. What's interesting about 
that is We'd only been offering that about three

40:56.896 --> 41:05.845
months when the federal government passed some 
national legislation requiring local utility

40:56.896 --> 41:05.845
companies to offer that service. So we were there 
doing something that was taken over by the local

41:06.745 --> 41:11.990
utility companies. We did come up with some 
preliminary zoning performance standards for

41:14.293 --> 41:18.557
the canals, wetland areas, and drainage areas. 
But we never implemented them. We did have the

41:21.740 --> 41:23.161
standards. We tried to make reference to them in 
our PUD. in the processing of our PUD requests. But

41:29.306 --> 41:31.969
we were never able to put those into ordinance 
format. Now, after I left, I believe about a year

41:32.449 --> 41:37.435
after I left, Roger Hedrick was able to get some of 
these standards adopted. And I think they do have

41:37.996 --> 41:44.403
much more, much stronger controls now than they do 
when I was there. A lot of the interest and support

41:44.883 --> 41:48.687
for environmental planning no longer exists. And 
Roger's not going to ever be near as effective as I

41:48.988 --> 41:51.691
was. The planner that I'd hired right away finally 
left because he was so discouraged by the change in

41:56.296 --> 41:58.460
political environment there. And they were 
elected to the city to continue to see us poke our

41:59.101 --> 42:07.655
nose into the environmental areas, which didn't 
have that much support from the citizens. So

42:07.675 --> 42:13.245
that's in summary what we were able to do in a very 
short period of time, two years. We tried to make up

42:14.887 --> 42:19.435
for a period of 10 to 15 years of neglect in 
planning. and probably one of the most productive

42:19.769 --> 42:23.835
two years in my life. I was enthusiastic. It was the 
first time that I was really a planning director

42:25.718 --> 42:30.265
where I had professional staff. I had kind of 
served as a planning director in a very small city

42:30.305 --> 42:39.600
for two years while I was going to school, but never 
had I had the chance to be in charge With complete

42:40.053 --> 42:41.215
freedom. I had complete freedom. The city manager 
did not dictate to me, did not direct my program

42:42.056 --> 42:46.261
efforts. I had 100% authority to look at anything 
and to do anything and everything that I wanted to

42:46.782 --> 42:52.209
do. And I had complete freedom to bring it up to the 
commission and the council and take the heat for

42:53.211 --> 42:57.917
it. The council, I would say, was reluctant to pass 
many of the things that they did. In summary here,

43:03.504 --> 43:05.487
they was reluctant to do it. They were not 
enthusiastic supporters of planning or of

43:05.768 --> 43:09.132
regulations. They kept being forced into it. And I 
felt like our technical work was so sound. Our

43:16.444 --> 43:17.506
logic was so good. Our justification for it was so 
good. Our press coverage was so supportive. And

43:23.096 --> 43:26.862
not just local, but the Houston papers and the 
Houston news stations as well. And then the

43:27.263 --> 43:32.332
behind-the-scenes influence that many of our 
commissioners and our special interest groups

43:27.263 --> 43:32.332
had in the community. All that in combination made 
it a but mean hog heaven for a planner. It was an

43:36.826 --> 43:39.189
ideal time, a very exciting time. I was 
disappointed to leave. I left the island

43:42.954 --> 43:49.863
primarily because my wife didn't like Galveston. 
She wanted to pursue her education. Galveston has

43:51.725 --> 43:57.833
no educational opportunities for higher 
education, unless you want to be a medical

43:51.725 --> 43:57.833
student.

43:59.753 --> 44:03.921
I had the chance to go to a larger community, double 
the size, Beaumont, Texas. And there was a good

44:04.842 --> 44:07.648
city manager there who sold me on that. And going to 
that city, too, told me that I could do in Beaumont

44:08.169 --> 44:12.196
what I did in Galveston. And he'd be supportive of 
it. And he wanted me over there. So that kind of new

44:15.883 --> 44:19.770
challenge and the chance to make my wife happy, I 
made the decision to move on over there. I've been

44:24.733 --> 44:26.335
tempted a couple of times to go back. I know that the 
current city manager was the assistant city

44:26.375 --> 44:29.761
manager when I was there. We're very good friends, 
personal friends. And Steve was a great person to

44:32.706 --> 44:36.493
work with there on the staff. And he's talked to me a 
couple of times about coming back and one of these

44:36.878 --> 44:44.328
years they may end up twisting my arm and getting me 
back down there. Is there any particular

44:44.348 --> 44:50.717
legislation, state and federal, that's really 
impacted Galveston's planning?

44:54.943 --> 44:56.886
Well, not in the mandatory sense. Galveston was 
doing things for the right reason. We were doing

45:00.379 --> 45:03.244
plans because they were useful, because they were 
needed. And we were always, the end state wasn't

45:03.925 --> 45:06.809
the plan. The plan was the means of giving us a 
strategy, the mechanism, the step-by-step

45:07.730 --> 45:14.681
approach to getting to where we wanted to go. So 
Galveston did not necessarily benefit from any

45:15.622 --> 45:24.115
kind of legislation that I was ever aware of. 
Secondarily, we did. Sure, the Coastal Zone

45:25.986 --> 45:29.215
Energy Impact Program was beneficial to us. It 
gave us some money to use for acquisitions, for

45:29.235 --> 45:33.889
development. But we weren't using monies for 
planning purposes. We did have some

45:36.397 --> 45:38.543
transportation planning money.
