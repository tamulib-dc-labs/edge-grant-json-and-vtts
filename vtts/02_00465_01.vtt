WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:06.764
To start off with, could you give me some 
information about where you were born and when?

00:07.465 --> 00:10.910
Yes, Enid, Oklahoma, January 18th, 1939. My 
parents were both involved in the war. My father

00:17.078 --> 00:20.502
graduated from Enid Flying School with Advanced 
Air Force Base. He was killed as a B-17 pilot in

00:20.522 --> 00:24.988
World War II in England in 1944. My mother flew with 
Amelia Earhart's WASP, so she was gone. My

00:30.275 --> 00:31.557
grandparents raised me. I attended schools in 
Enid until I was having extreme difficulty

00:32.785 --> 00:43.701
growing up like most young men in about the ninth 
grade. Unlike a lot of young men, my father left me

00:45.083 --> 00:52.714
$10,000 insurance when he was killed. That's what 
the government paid then for your life. And I

00:55.719 --> 00:58.503
looked through Ladies Home Journal. I saw a lot of 
advertisements for preparatory schools. I wrote

01:02.013 --> 01:08.660
off to them, even though I was failing in the ninth 
grade, and received brochures back. I don't know

01:08.980 --> 01:18.830
why they accepted me, but I went to Fork Union 
Military Academy in Virginia from Oklahoma and

01:08.980 --> 01:18.830
did very well there. Whatever I may become, I have 
to give thanks to them because they certainly

01:19.571 --> 01:26.678
provided the foundation. I had an appointment to 
West Point since that was what I went to Fork Union

01:26.698 --> 01:30.602
for. I came back to Oklahoma, having graduated in 
the summer of 57, and applied for Texas A&M

01:31.477 --> 01:46.463
because, very frankly, I was burned out on gray, 
stiff wool uniforms. And I just couldn't see

01:47.084 --> 01:50.470
myself starting over another four years that way. 
The Texas A&M Corps, as I remember in those days,

01:51.632 --> 01:55.999
had almost 6,000. was one of the most famous corps 
in the United States. And I decided I want to be a

01:59.876 --> 02:01.858
part of the best. That's why I applied. But I was 
really a young man rolling around looking for a

02:05.402 --> 02:09.486
hole to fall into. And before I could get down here 
at Texas A&M, I went over and joined the

02:10.387 --> 02:14.372
paratroops. And that was in August of 1957.

02:21.460 --> 02:49.493
even with all my military training the fact that 
i've probably forgotten more about some of the

02:21.460 --> 02:49.493
weapons having been trained in the rotc program 
and some of the sergeants for example my drill

02:21.460 --> 02:49.493
sergeant had been a locomotive engineer and knew 
nothing about what we were doing and i was always a

02:21.460 --> 02:49.493
trainee platoon sergeant in my individual and 
advanced training i was court-martialed twice in

02:21.460 --> 02:49.493
the first eight weeks

02:21.460 --> 02:49.493
so i got kind of started off on a bad foot even though 
At the end of the first eight weeks, the command

02:49.996 --> 02:53.820
wanted to send me to OCS. I refused to go because I 
wanted to be in Special Forces, more than I wanted

02:54.761 --> 02:58.785
to be an officer. So I ended up in Special Forces at 
Fort Bragg as a demolitionist. And the only reason

03:05.052 --> 03:10.378
I really became a Ranger, or became an officer, is 
because I wanted to be a Ranger. And I kept applying

03:11.158 --> 03:18.366
for Ranger training, and Special Forces didn't 
receive Ranger training those days, since we got

03:11.158 --> 03:18.366
it as part of our normal day-to-day duties. 
Finally, Sergeant Ortiz, the 77th, said, Bo, if

03:20.850 --> 03:26.758
you want to go to Ranger school, you got to be a 
second lieutenant. I said, well, make me a second

03:27.179 --> 03:28.681
lieutenant. So he gave me the forms for OCS. I 
filled them out. I went to OCS. I went to Ranger

03:34.229 --> 03:35.190
training. And following that, I found out 
something. I couldn't get back in Special Forces

03:38.855 --> 03:42.761
because there were no second lieutenants in 
Special Forces. That's all I really cared about

03:43.682 --> 03:46.406
was being there. So after I made first lieutenant, 
I went back to Special Forces. And then in 1964, I

03:50.928 --> 03:57.936
went to Vietnam and served four years in Vietnam. 
My jobs included being the chief of

03:58.497 --> 04:11.072
reconnaissance and the intelligence officer for 
Project Delta, which at that time was the only one

03:58.497 --> 04:11.072
of the super secret organizations that was in 
operation. Our job was to go into denied areas and

04:11.112 --> 04:15.657
obtain intelligence. Following that, I 
organized at the direction of General

04:16.717 --> 04:25.405
Westmoreland the first American commanded 
guerrilla force. And it was supposed to have been a

04:25.425 --> 04:32.551
volunteer operation where once we tested it, we 
would all get our choice of assignments. We know

04:32.571 --> 04:33.432
how that works. If you're successful, they want 
you to stay together for one more, for one more, for

04:33.492 --> 04:37.796
one more. So four operations later, we had finally 
completed our guerrilla mission. It was during

04:43.161 --> 04:44.142
that time We recovered the U-2 that General Russ 
Mullen writes about in his book, A Soldier

04:44.560 --> 04:49.188
Reports. That was just one of our training 
missions. Following that, General Wyatt asked me

04:53.034 --> 05:00.647
to form a unit that could do a myriad of special 
activities. For example, blowing up bridges at

05:00.867 --> 05:06.757
the Air Force where it was having difficult 
hitting, raiding enemy headquarters. Gorillas

05:06.777 --> 05:08.620
are two and a half miles an hour. They're limited by 
foot power. And they don't travel very fast.

05:12.840 --> 05:13.941
They're not very responsive. Plus, we couldn't 
keep our prisoners alive. And they wanted

05:16.304 --> 05:19.468
prisoners from various areas. So we restructured 
the guerrilla command into what was called a

05:20.009 --> 05:26.757
special task force B-36. And I formed that. As 
cannon fodder, I required five Americans from

05:30.442 --> 05:36.770
each of the infantry divisions, five LURPs. The 
general wanted to know if I wanted sergeants. They

05:39.773 --> 05:41.095
were airborne ranger. And I said, no, because the 
division commanders will never give them up.

05:45.302 --> 05:46.403
Those are their prized people. I said, I just want 
somebody who is long-range reconnaissance

05:46.423 --> 05:50.969
patrol qualified. Part of my Delta duties was to 
train LRPS. And so I was a chief instructor at the

05:55.534 --> 06:00.199
Rekondo School in Vietnam until we formed the 
guerrilla command. B-36 was very successful at

06:02.081 --> 06:04.804
what we did. it was at the end of four years i had just 
put in for an extension leave i was working for

06:05.392 --> 06:32.766
general wyatt on special operations and i went to 
him with a proposal because i was using cambodians

06:05.392 --> 06:32.766
i didn't speak cambodia and our missions were 
extremely high visibility i wanted to obtain a

06:05.392 --> 06:32.766
force that i could communicate with because 
frequently more fire came from behind us than came

06:05.392 --> 06:32.766
from the front of us meaning the cambodes that 
followed you directly behind you were fine but

06:33.083 --> 06:53.826
those on the flanks often were behind you and 
didn't know what was going on so you had as much

06:33.083 --> 06:53.826
danger of being shot from the rear as you did in the 
front in many cases so i asked him if i could have the

06:33.083 --> 06:53.826
prisoners out of long been jail since they their 
lives were basically finished And in about 30 or 60

06:54.245 --> 06:57.209
days, I could train them as guerrillas. And they 
spoke English. And we could probably have

07:00.535 --> 07:05.442
increased our productivity some 300, 400%. It was 
at that time that Wyatt changed my mind and showed

07:06.464 --> 07:12.152
me the light about Vietnam. He said, quote, Bo, 
stop trying to win the war. You're not going to win

07:16.759 --> 07:17.781
it. I'm not going to win it. Use this war to benefit 
your career. He said, be ahead of your

07:23.067 --> 07:26.492
contemporaries. Come up on the general staff. 
I'll give you a job here. Use the war to get your

07:30.417 --> 07:34.323
promotions earlier than those that aren't over 
here. And it just thunderstruck me because we were

07:35.264 --> 07:41.874
in the field dying and trying. And I said to him, 
yes, sir, I know that I can't win the war by myself,

07:42.755 --> 07:50.526
and even you as the daddy rabbit can't win it. But if 
we don't try every day as hard as we can, the thing

07:50.962 --> 07:54.427
will never be over. But I realized then that he had, 
being the commander, he knew things that I didn't

07:55.128 --> 08:01.458
know. There was no intent of winning that war. And I 
decided instantly that I would not be responsible

08:04.042 --> 08:10.471
for one life, one limb, one liberty being lost 
again. So I left Vietnam and came back to the United

08:11.313 --> 08:16.260
States very disillusioned. And it's ironic, 
because over my headquarters, some of my

08:17.050 --> 08:26.449
sergeants had placed this plaque that we took with 
us, my headquarters, wherever we happened to set

08:17.050 --> 08:26.449
up in the jungle. But it had four lines. The first 
line said, we come because we believe. And that's

08:31.298 --> 08:31.859
true. We were all there because we believed in what 
we were doing. The second line said, we leave

08:35.246 --> 08:38.873
because we're disillusioned. And that's 
precisely what I did. The third line, I almost

08:41.733 --> 08:44.757
succumbed to, too. It said, we return because 
we're lost. And the last line said, we die because

08:47.921 --> 08:50.825
we're committed. And that is exactly what 
happened to many of those brave soldiers there who

08:51.826 --> 08:59.376
stayed with me over those periods of time. They'd 
get disillusioned. They'd go home. Next thing you

09:01.479 --> 09:03.261
know, here they'd be back again. The next thing you 
know, they're in a body bag. And I almost

09:06.225 --> 09:07.527
succumbed. fit that scenario myself. When you 
come back from the war, what does the Army do with

09:10.184 --> 09:14.170
you? Most 19-year-old kids who came back, and 
that's what the average age was in Vietnam, flew.

09:20.460 --> 09:24.306
It took them 19 hours to get in the combat zone to 
Travis Air Force Base. When they got there, they

09:25.027 --> 09:32.980
were given a piece of paper and said, thank you, 
patted on the ass, and left to figure out what had

09:25.027 --> 09:32.980
happened to them for the last year. And in that very 
traumatic part of their life. When most kids were

09:36.917 --> 09:45.465
going to trade school, going to college, or 
figuring out what they wanted to be when they grow

09:36.917 --> 09:45.465
up, these kids were over there watching their 
friends get their heads blown off. And it affects

09:45.485 --> 09:49.909
you, especially at that young age. I was a 
professional, had been through every combat

09:50.009 --> 09:55.134
school that the military had when I went there. I 
was prepared for Vietnam, except I hadn't had that

09:56.295 --> 10:01.480
acid test. I craved it. I was there because I should 
have been there. and because I wanted to be there.

10:07.714 --> 10:15.703
At any rate,

10:07.714 --> 10:15.703
I was really affected at four years of doing 
nothing but killing the enemy every day. It's a

10:16.344 --> 10:24.613
very, for lack of a better term, fearful when I 
thought about coming back to the United States.

10:25.094 --> 10:26.696
What do those people have in common with me? What is 
my role there? Who am I there? I knew who I was in

10:30.360 --> 10:32.523
Vietnam. I knew what my role was. It was very clear. 
What am I going to do in the United States? How do I

10:38.875 --> 10:39.695
relate? Because to me that was the unreal world. We 
were committed in Vietnam, committed to winning

10:42.499 --> 10:46.823
that war, and whatever that meant. So when I came 
back, the Army was very good to me. They first of all

10:50.627 --> 10:53.731
sent me to a year and a half of Chinese language 
school. God knows that was the hardest thing that

10:54.391 --> 10:57.375
I've ever done. I guess for damn near 18 hours a day, 
because that's what it takes to study Chinese.

11:04.062 --> 11:09.669
trying to defuse me, bring my RPMs down from red 
line to idle. And following that, I went to Command

11:09.689 --> 11:13.713
General Staff College. I graduated, honored 
graduate of the Command General Staff College.

11:18.219 --> 11:22.964
When I finished that, again, I applied for duty in 
Vietnam. And my best friend, who will be the chief

11:22.984 --> 11:29.412
of staff in the Army someday, said, Bo, please 
don't go back there. And I see now that it perfectly

11:30.185 --> 11:33.809
met that equation. We returned because we're 
lost. And I said, no, I've got to go back over there.

11:39.755 --> 11:44.800
As long as that war is there, I cannot have let my 
friends have died in vain. We must win that war. He

11:49.724 --> 11:50.605
talked me out of that. He said, Bo, that's crap. 
Stay here. You're only going to lose over there.

11:58.298 --> 11:59.720
And I listened to him. I listened to him again when 
he told me to marry the wife that I have now. And he

12:02.543 --> 12:03.765
was right about that, too. So anyway, the Army sent 
me to school, having gone through about three

12:04.806 --> 12:11.694
years of defusing. But even when I was in the 
Command General Staff College, I, at nighttime,

12:12.235 --> 12:19.484
would shoot the lights out in the town of 
Leavenworth. I'm sure the prison geared up 100

12:19.504 --> 12:24.610
times when I would come home at night. Tucson, 
Arizona didn't have very many streetlights in it.

12:27.159 --> 12:28.341
I didn't put bullet holes through. For about three 
years as a field grade officer, I was doing things

12:28.381 --> 12:35.572
like that because it was still the year of the gun. 
And people just tolerated me. I guess I never had

12:38.636 --> 12:40.459
any trouble with anybody. I threw colonels over 
the bar at Fort Leavenworth. It was just the nature

12:45.106 --> 12:47.710
of the beast then. So... And then ironically 
enough I was given a job on the art. Well, I was

12:53.445 --> 12:59.012
supposed to go with Nixon to China Because he was 
when he made his trip over there. He was going over

12:59.032 --> 13:09.425
to establish a US mission He thought but the 
Chinese weren't ready for that yet So I was

12:59.032 --> 13:09.425
selected as because they didn't have an old seven 
which was a Brigadier General. They were looking

13:09.445 --> 13:20.078
for that spoke Chinese they tagged me to go and Then 
it fell apart because the Chinese weren't going to

13:09.445 --> 13:20.078
cooperate with Nixon that quickly As a result, I 
said, what do I do now? I had jobs because I had

13:23.886 --> 13:29.312
graduated high in the CNGS, any place I wanted it. I 
ended up on the Army General Staff working for

13:29.912 --> 13:32.735
General Westmoreland. He said he wanted someone 
as a spokesman for the Army who had decorations on

13:33.376 --> 13:39.382
their chest and not a journalist. And his job, even 
though he hated it at that time, he directly

13:40.704 --> 13:45.929
opposed it, was to sell the Modern Volunteer Army. 
And it was my job to act as as his spokesman in doing

13:50.045 --> 13:51.486
that. I believed in it, because I didn't want 
anything but volunteers around me. But he showed

13:55.790 --> 13:59.093
me where I was very tunnel visioned. And where the 
modern volunteer army doesn't work, we should

13:59.113 --> 14:02.296
have the draft. And he's right, because we have cut 
out that cross-section of American society that

14:02.336 --> 14:12.986
keeps America interested in what the military is 
doing and keeps the army a part of society instead

14:02.336 --> 14:12.986
of apart from it. So at any rate, at that time, 
General Abrams came on board. And Abrams hated

14:19.559 --> 14:21.443
special forces. And so he took one look at me and 
said, I've got nothing to say to you. And a good

14:27.077 --> 14:30.866
friend of mine, General Seidel, asked me, he said, 
Bo, how would you like to go to school? So again,

14:31.447 --> 14:35.577
when they don't have anything for a soldier to do, 
they send him to school. As a result, I became

14:36.316 --> 14:54.617
highly degreed as a victim of circumstance, and I 
really haven't used any of the scholastic talents

14:36.316 --> 14:54.617
other than the bits of trivia that help you in your 
day-to-day life.

14:54.637 --> 15:03.808
After finishing the school, I was selected to go 
down and command the Special Forces in Panama, and

14:54.637 --> 15:03.808
I did that for two years. It was there that General 
Harold R. Aaron, who was a major general then,

15:04.345 --> 15:10.191
first contacted me. He was the chief of military 
intelligence then. He came to Panama and he asked

15:13.434 --> 15:21.982
me to think about how we might be able to gain 
information on American POWs in Southeast Asia.

15:23.123 --> 15:27.988
It totally dumbfounded me because I was a 
commander of special forces in Panama. I was

15:28.448 --> 15:33.373
concerned only about Latin America, the 
strategic protection of the Canal Zone, and all

15:33.809 --> 15:36.513
this other kind of crap. He was talking about last 
life, you know, Vietnam. And I remember when he

15:41.741 --> 15:47.570
left, I told my intelligence officer, Randy 
Young, the general's clutches slipping. You

15:47.790 --> 15:50.054
know, he's back in Vietnam. I was inexplicably 
transferred to the Office of the Secretary of

15:50.074 --> 15:58.407
Defense, much against General McAuliffe, who was 
the sink south. Objections. He wanted me to stay

15:59.048 --> 16:01.892
down there in Panama, but... OSD, somebody 
pressed a button. I ended up going to the Defense

16:05.966 --> 16:14.716
Security Assistance Agency as the Congressional 
Relations Chief. And General Fish was my

16:14.736 --> 16:18.180
commander there. When I said, what the hell am I 
doing in Washington, D.C. as Congressional

16:18.801 --> 16:22.165
Relations? I'm a jungle fighter. And he said, Bo, 
you'll find your assignment here is much like that

16:23.887 --> 16:31.255
that you're used to, the jungles of Washington. 
are just different in that they're concrete, but

16:31.640 --> 16:38.452
they're still insidious, and they're still 
dangerous, and we need your kind of skills here.

16:40.495 --> 16:45.003
The committee that I worked with was a foreign 
relations committee, both in the House and the

16:40.495 --> 16:45.003
Senate. They have oversight for the POW issue. It 
was in October of 1978 when Aaron came to me. Now

16:53.056 --> 16:57.664
he's a lieutenant general, and the number two man 
in the Defense Intelligence Agency said, Bo,

16:58.150 --> 17:01.333
we've got overwhelming evidence that Americans 
are still being held. We'd like you to consider

17:01.353 --> 17:10.942
retirement so that you can work through the 
private sector because the Carter

17:01.353 --> 17:10.942
administration has politically handcuffed us 
from doing anything about the POW issue. I was to

17:12.304 --> 17:15.167
take a hiatus in my military career. It didn't turn 
out that way. It's been five years. I will not go

17:18.810 --> 17:20.231
back in uniform. I don't think. The reason the FBI 
asked me in January of 1983, Bo, are you ready to

17:22.954 --> 17:28.039
come back in uniform now? I said, no. He said, why? I 
said, because the job's not over. And I caveated

17:32.314 --> 17:36.159
that further by saying, I don't think I will 
either. And the guy says, why not? Because at the

17:40.043 --> 17:45.189
time of my retirement, I was at the very good times 
of your career. You work hard in the Army to finally

17:45.650 --> 17:48.273
get someplace. And I had finally gotten to the 
point where the Army was going to be fun for me. and

17:52.910 --> 18:17.652
then to give it up right at that time didn't make 
sense matter of fact army times ran a big front page

17:52.910 --> 18:17.652
article when i retired that said it was a surprise 
it was and nobody believed the reasons i gave and

17:52.910 --> 18:17.652
they were right but i couldn't tell them why i 
retired at that time bottom line is that it is far

17:52.910 --> 18:17.652
more important that this issue be resolved 
correctly for the good of the nation than it is for

18:18.037 --> 18:25.904
any one person to have fun with the Army. And for 
that reason, as an urge in my conscience, I cannot

18:26.945 --> 18:34.673
quit until this thing is resolved 
satisfactorily. I will not quit. So far I've had no

18:36.795 --> 18:39.157
one ask me to quit. I think that secretly each one of 
the people in the bureaucracy hopes that we will

18:39.978 --> 18:45.343
succeed. I know that not so secretly, many people 
in the military, especially Fort Bragg, my

18:46.066 --> 19:00.465
contemporaries, embrace me when I go to see them in 
the Pentagon, are praying that we will be

18:46.066 --> 19:00.465
successful because they know what we're doing is 
right. So that's without stopping. a capsule of

19:03.211 --> 19:28.999
what's gone down go ahead and get specific now okay 
when you were in vietnam in 1964 and you were doing

19:03.211 --> 19:28.999
your specific years this specific mission down 
there um what positive advantages came about

19:03.211 --> 19:28.999
through being involved with all these ambushes 
and attacks what what advantages do you feel the

19:03.211 --> 19:28.999
advantage yeah the advantage was that uh It taught 
me lessons about life that you'll never learn in

19:28.979 --> 19:36.267
the philosophy or theology books. You learn what 
life is about. Many of the parables that you read in

19:44.056 --> 19:58.733
the Bible become clear to you once you have 
experienced the realities of snuffing out human

19:44.056 --> 19:58.733
life with a mere pound and a half's pressure 
trigger or claymore mine you realize and I knew a

19:59.877 --> 20:23.995
couple of times that I was I was approaching 
insanity over there from that point of view when

19:59.877 --> 20:23.995
suddenly you would see a man that was a living human 
being who had a family just like yours who had

19:59.877 --> 20:23.995
aspirations and hope for life One moment when 
you're in ambush, he is there thinking, living,

20:24.532 --> 20:34.583
feeling, and the next moment he's garbage, laying 
along the trail. It makes you realize that

20:36.585 --> 20:40.129
something is not right about it. And as a soldier, 
you're doing your job. Thank God, because when I

20:44.613 --> 20:53.543
finished the war, when I left, I had a terrible 
time, as I said, coming back to the United States,

20:44.613 --> 20:53.543
trying to find My handhold here. One of the first 
things I did is I came back and I went home to Tucson,

20:58.386 --> 21:10.339
Arizona, where my mother then lived, and tried to 
come to grips before my language school started. I

21:10.419 --> 21:12.241
had about a month and a half. I ended up going up on a 
mountain in northern Mexico by myself because

21:12.261 --> 21:18.708
there was nobody here who could help me. Nobody 
here knew what my problem was. Nobody had ever been

21:22.111 --> 21:23.513
a part of it. I married a Chinese girl and brought 
her back with me, a Chinese ethnic, Vietnamese

21:24.033 --> 21:33.126
origin, because she was the only one who knew who I 
was. She was my identity. She knew how hard we had

21:34.969 --> 21:36.491
tried. She knew my friends who had died. I needed 
her as my ID card. It didn't work out, even though I

21:42.860 --> 21:46.205
did get two wonderful kids from her. But I went up on 
the mountain to find out, one, if there was a chance

21:47.366 --> 21:53.415
that I had a life, I was raised in Pentecostal 
churches in Oklahoma, and you're not supposed to

21:54.003 --> 22:04.013
kill people, let alone hundreds of them. And you 
have to reconcile yourself. When I went up there, I

22:06.716 --> 22:14.584
took one bullet in my 9mm, not to protect me against 
the wolves, because certainly if they were going

22:06.716 --> 22:14.584
to eat you, they were going to eat you. But as a final 
determiner, If I couldn't have reconciled myself

22:19.923 --> 22:32.783
and saw that I do have a good life to live, then I 
would have started as quickly as I could whatever

22:19.923 --> 22:32.783
comes after. The fact is that a lot of things did 
come very clear to me, I had to answer the questions

22:39.953 --> 22:41.736
Why do people die like that? Is it all right for a 
soldier to take those lives? Why do babies have to

22:46.083 --> 22:47.606
die? There are all kinds of those questions that 
many Vietnam vets had to answer. I was lucky enough

22:51.793 --> 22:54.898
because I had the intelligence. I went up there. I 
got those answers. When I came down, I was a whole

22:59.085 --> 23:02.350
human being again. I was still pretty frisky, like 
I say. I shot out a lot of streetlights. I threw a lot

23:06.327 --> 23:11.514
of people over the bars, but I was settled in my 
life. That saved me. So Vietnam gave me a positive

23:15.300 --> 23:22.270
thing in that it gave me the secret to life, and that 
is a paradox. Many things are paradoxes about

23:23.051 --> 23:25.114
combat. If you're going to live, you must choose 
the road to death. That may not sound right. But it

23:31.253 --> 23:34.638
simply means if you're going to live, you can't be 
thinking about home. You can't be thinking about

23:35.099 --> 23:38.143
wife, family, D-Rose. Before I would go on a 
mission, I would see myself being killed in every

23:38.164 --> 23:42.991
conceivable way. That way I had already died by 
parachute crashing into the trees or into a band of

23:43.812 --> 23:54.729
cobras or being blown apart as I hung in the trees by 
the enemy machine gunner. Having already died

23:55.330 --> 23:59.556
those ways, then there's no place for the enemy's 
bullet. And so when you go into combat, you have

24:00.295 --> 24:04.221
chosen the road to death. You're much more alert. 
Hopefully the enemy is thinking about home or what

24:05.783 --> 24:12.634
he's going to do when he gets back. And in that 
moment is when the bullet enters his brain and

24:12.734 --> 24:19.004
stops his life. So there are many of those 
paradoxes, but yes, there are. I gained the secret

24:23.195 --> 24:27.100
of life through learning about death. What 
specifically did you do in Vietnam, and what unit

24:28.461 --> 24:32.626
were you in? Okay, to give you specifics, when I 
first went over there, I organized a camp called

24:33.568 --> 24:39.134
Sui Da. Sui Da means Rock Creek. It's next to Nui Ba 
Den Mountain, which is very famous in Vietnam as a

24:40.636 --> 24:44.841
shrine. Nui Ba Den means the Black Virgin 
Mountain. My unit was called A322. Later, I went to

24:52.034 --> 25:05.811
Delta Project as the first officer who was the 
reconnaissance chief, and I was called

24:52.034 --> 25:05.811
Detachment B-52, and I was the reconnaissance 
chief and the intelligence officer for Project

24:52.034 --> 25:05.811
Delta. Then I was the chief instructor of the McVie 
Recondo School. Following that, I formed The

25:15.625 --> 25:18.429
guerrilla task force called 957. That means 21 as 
blackjack as a winner. That's why it came about

25:22.013 --> 25:25.097
like that. Later, it turned into Detachment B-36, 
Special Task Force B-36. And later, that turned

25:31.646 --> 25:34.490
into the 3rd Mobile Strike Command. If you look in 
the lineage of Vietnam, I formed each one of those

25:35.251 --> 25:40.538
units. And then after they were formed, I 
eventually left them. I left the 3rd Mobile Strike

25:44.127 --> 25:48.852
Command after becoming disillusioned in 
November of 1968.

25:51.875 --> 25:54.378
And I was the commander of each one of them. Each one 
of them contained American troops. I had one of the

25:58.702 --> 26:01.605
very unique commands in Vietnam. In B-36, for 
example, I had

26:01.705 --> 26:11.215
five companies of Chinese that we used as security 
forces. I had eight companies of Cambodians that

26:11.971 --> 26:16.275
we used as guerrilla forces. I had about 50 
American special forces that made up special

26:17.697 --> 26:23.522
teams. And I had five LURPs from each infantry 
division that made up my reconnaissance unit. And

26:29.568 --> 26:31.991
I had a team of SAS from the Australians. So I had a 
real cross-section of everybody there. So that's

26:39.157 --> 26:40.358
what it was all about. What was the motivation, 
your motivation to your valor in Vietnam in which

26:41.119 --> 26:48.406
you received all these 60 decorations? Just doing 
the job. It's very hard for Special Forces to be

26:51.349 --> 26:54.152
decorated in Vietnam. The reason is because in the 
divisions, a two-star general is authorized to

26:54.432 --> 27:00.058
give up to a silver star. We had no two-star 
generals in Special Forces. So if we were going to

27:04.782 --> 27:07.645
get a decoration, General Westmoreland had to 
give it. General Westmoreland didn't have much

27:08.418 --> 27:14.648
time, being the daddy rabbit, to deal with Special 
Forces. So much of the things that Special Forces

27:15.329 --> 27:19.836
did went totally unsung. For example, we got 
nothing for recovering the U-2. You'd have

27:23.301 --> 27:24.863
thought that would have been a big deal. It was big 
enough for him to single it out as the example of the

27:25.765 --> 27:34.078
American soldier, but no decorations were given 
for that U-2 operation. Nobody thinks about the

27:34.098 --> 27:36.822
soldier when he's doing his job. we were just there 
doing the job trying to win the war and the

27:38.253 --> 28:07.720
decorations that i received came from generals 
that we worked for because they were astounded by

27:38.253 --> 28:07.720
our work general hay commanding general first 
division for example gave me two silver stars in in

27:38.253 --> 28:07.720
one day and said bo i wish that there was some higher 
decoration we could give your command he lined my

27:38.253 --> 28:07.720
whole command up and awarded silver stars He said, 
but this is the highest award I can give you. He

28:10.769 --> 28:13.432
says, what you people are doing is amazing. I don't 
know how you do that. He said, what do you eat, for

28:15.534 --> 28:17.196
example? I pulled out a package of indigenous 
ration, which was dried rice and minnows. He said,

28:23.462 --> 28:26.725
God, we could never feed Americans that. But see, 
he forgets that special forces are Americans,

28:26.745 --> 28:29.228
too. So the lines of our motto, We came because we 
believed. We were there because we believed in

28:40.752 --> 28:42.995
each other. And once you start it, it is a 
continuous cycle. How do you end it? We had to make

28:50.526 --> 29:00.341
sure, it seemed to me, that the men who had 
sacrificed their life, their limbs, their

28:50.526 --> 29:00.341
liberties, didn't do so in vain. That meant one 
thing, victory. There is no in-between. It's

29:04.567 --> 29:05.989
victory or it's defeat. And I was resolved to stay 
there the duration, plus six, whatever that

29:07.015 --> 29:12.323
meant. One of the big mistakes we made in Vietnam 
was that we sent generals there for one year. And a

29:18.452 --> 29:24.481
general going there for one year figured, geez, if 
I don't do anything, maybe I won't do anything

29:18.452 --> 29:24.481
wrong. And the generals should have all gone 
there, like we did in World War II. You come home

29:29.308 --> 29:30.930
when the job is done. But we were trying to get 
everybody through the combat experience.

29:35.836 --> 29:40.706
Everybody came over there looking to enhance 
their career by spending one year in a combat zone.

29:41.307 --> 29:48.261
And then, like General Wyant said, using it as part 
of your ticket punching to get ahead of your

29:41.307 --> 29:48.261
contemporaries. So I had all my tickets punched. I 
got advanced degrees. I've been on the Army

29:52.970 --> 30:01.142
general staff, the Office of the Secretary of 
Defense staff, all of the Army schools where I

29:52.970 --> 30:01.142
graduated, honored graduate from. And even all 
that ticket punching isn't enough to override my

30:01.843 --> 30:12.479
conscience, because I know what must be done in 
this case. And I was wrong about Vietnam. We

30:15.784 --> 30:17.927
shouldn't have been there. being there we should 
have won it and it was only when i realized that was

30:18.380 --> 30:31.917
impossible that i was not going to continue to 
throw good energy after bad and i quit

30:34.276 --> 30:35.718
You just mentioned the generals. If we could do it 
all over again, what do you feel the United States

30:36.158 --> 30:41.164
should do to win the war? Well, I think the first 
thing is the United States should not have fought a

30:41.724 --> 30:45.469
war in the first place. I think the United States 
has an obligation to wake up. I'm so damn mad at the

30:49.653 --> 30:54.499
American people because we have become a nation of 
spectators. We lay back and we love to be

30:55.260 --> 31:01.026
entertained, but we've forgotten and we 
criticize the government. But the government is

31:01.478 --> 31:05.450
of the people, by the people, and for the people. 
And we forget that. Those people working in

31:06.793 --> 31:10.344
Washington, D.C. are elected by us and work for us. 
If they do something wrong, damn it, it's our

31:10.705 --> 31:13.874
fault. And participative government has become a 
thing of the past. And so if we educate ourselves,

31:17.071 --> 31:22.580
we are obligated as a nation to know what the hell is 
going on. If we would have done our homework about

31:23.101 --> 31:28.270
Vietnam, we would have found out that we should 
have never been there in the first place. In 1944,

31:28.610 --> 31:31.916
Ho Chi Minh embraced us. The OSS trained Ho Chi 
Minh. We gave him equipment. He loved the

31:35.963 --> 31:37.205
Americans. The war was won in 1945. Instead of the 
United States taking over the... the transition

31:43.632 --> 31:51.207
of government in Southeast Asia, they turned it 
over to the British because our primary effort was

31:43.632 --> 31:51.207
in Japan and in Europe. When the British took over, 
it was decided for some moment of insanity that we

31:52.369 --> 32:01.708
would give the control of Southeast Asia back to 
the French. Ho Chi Minh then tapped us on the

32:02.448 --> 32:06.513
shoulder and says, what are you doing? Are you 
going to stand by and let them recolonize our

32:06.573 --> 32:11.138
countries? We should have our independence. The 
Japanese gave us the independence, for Christ's

32:12.500 --> 32:15.323
sake. But the United States would not intervene. 
We didn't even weigh in with the British in De

32:19.448 --> 32:23.573
Gaulle about that. We just turned our head away 
from Ho Chi Minh and said, sorry, we can't hear you,

32:23.734 --> 32:28.379
Ho. As a result, the French took over again. As a 
result, Ho Chi Minh begged us for support. We

32:35.606 --> 32:36.989
wouldn't give it to him. So he went to the people who 
would. He hated the Soviets, but they gave him the

32:39.033 --> 32:42.379
support. He fought the French, and he defeated 
them. And then here we come, right in their wake. If

32:48.269 --> 32:52.958
we would have done our homework and been educated, 
we would have never sent a steel helmet to Vietnam

32:48.269 --> 32:52.958
anyway. Special forces should have gone because 
that's the way to do it. We do it in a very

32:57.385 --> 33:02.095
low-profile, professional manner, small 
groups. I should have been in Vietnam, but 56,000

33:03.097 --> 33:15.942
19-year-olds should not have been that lost their 
life because a white face under a steel helmet

33:17.002 --> 33:24.368
gives every reason for a good, loyal Vietnamese, 
no matter where he is, to rally around the flag to

33:17.002 --> 33:24.368
get the hated Yankee out of his country. I was the 
intelligence officer for Delta Project. I saw

33:28.412 --> 33:36.299
that the North Vietnamese didn't start coming 
into the South until the Marines came over, until

33:28.412 --> 33:36.299
the Big Red One came over. When those steel helmets 
started arriving, the North Vietnamese built up

33:37.099 --> 33:43.685
in like numbers, and so began the Vietnam War. I 
don't think that would have happened. we wouldn't

33:46.600 --> 34:08.220
have sent those 19 year olds and it was a political 
war soldiers should not fight political wars

33:46.600 --> 34:08.220
politicians should when the politicians are not 
going to fight a political war then you fight a

33:46.600 --> 34:08.220
military war we could have won that war easily but 
we didn't because it wasn't a military victory we

33:46.600 --> 34:08.220
were interested in it was a political victory How 
did you feel coming back to the United States with

34:10.360 --> 34:14.383
the resentment against the war? I didn't care 
about that. It's a free country. And I almost got

34:18.787 --> 34:23.351
angry one day. I was in a school auditorium. And 
when we stood to say the Pledge of Allegiance to the

34:27.275 --> 34:37.744
flag, there was a black kid sitting directly in 
front of me who was long and gangly, about 6'5",

34:27.275 --> 34:37.744
obviously a young kid. And he refused to stand up. 
For a moment, I felt like pumping him on the back of

34:40.330 --> 34:45.697
his head because his mother was there and she was 
trying to get him to stand up. He wouldn't do it.

34:46.378 --> 34:50.243
Then I suddenly realized this is what we fight and 
die for. So this scumbag can sit here and act like an

34:50.283 --> 34:55.690
asshole. And I don't care. The dissenters were 
right, but for all the wrong reasons. The people

35:04.441 --> 35:08.446
who ran off to Canada were right, but for all the 
wrong reasons. They shouldn't have done it then.

35:10.537 --> 35:13.020
They should have spoken with one voice like the 
enemy did. But they may have seen something that I

35:14.361 --> 35:17.104
didn't see. Muhammad Ali, he went with his 
conscience. He did what I think is probably right.

35:24.071 --> 35:24.972
He did it the right way. He says, I'm not going to 
fight. But he didn't run off to Canada either. The

35:30.037 --> 35:31.619
fact is that our country was wrong. But at that 
time, we didn't know that. And past is always

35:33.941 --> 35:39.207
prologue and it's always 20-20 hindsight. But We 
didn't know that we were wrong then. So the

35:43.571 --> 35:45.013
dissenters were wrong. The protesters were 
wrong. They were right in the end, but they were

35:47.718 --> 35:53.689
right

35:47.718 --> 35:53.689
for the wrong reasons. But I didn't care about 
them. Nobody ever bothered me. And it's funny, in

35:58.838 --> 36:06.531
the book General Westmoreland wrote, the 
Pentagon advised me to refuse to allow him to use

35:58.838 --> 36:06.531
that story And they said the reason was because a 
lot of nuts were going to look me up, probably. But

36:12.288 --> 36:13.269
nobody ever had. I think it's because they think 
I'll probably kill them. War-crazed Vietnam vet.

36:18.794 --> 36:25.420
In all my POW efforts, some nice guy saved a movie 
star's life in Hollywood from being mugged. The

36:26.080 --> 36:29.583
guy had to change his phone to move out of town 
because he got so many death threats. I've never

36:30.144 --> 36:32.886
gotten one nut call on the phone. I've never gotten 
one letter that was a nut letter. I think it's

36:36.650 --> 36:42.520
because, I don't know why, maybe there's the aura, 
a threat, that they think I'll track them down or

36:36.650 --> 36:42.520
something. In San Francisco, people talk bad 
about the demonstrations there. I never bought a

36:47.689 --> 36:49.572
meal in San Francisco. When I came home from 
Vietnam, we were always in uniform. I used to eat

36:52.558 --> 36:55.142
breakfast there, the biggest breakfast I could 
get. And that was normally when we went over, ate

36:56.164 --> 36:59.189
breakfast. When I came back, it was usually in the 
evening. I'd eat supper there. never every time i

37:02.131 --> 37:25.742
would eat i would finish i'd get ready to pay and the 
waitress would tell me sir your meal has already

37:02.131 --> 37:25.742
been paid for and when i would ask and this happened 
god i was back across the river about 10 times

37:02.131 --> 37:25.742
because six months was each extension that you 
took and i was there for four years she would say sir

37:02.131 --> 37:25.742
your meal has already been paid for it was always 
anonymous So San Francisco was beautiful to me. I

37:28.418 --> 37:32.303
went to Las Vegas because I wanted to see a show one 
time when I'd come home to Vietnam. I didn't

37:32.323 --> 37:34.946
realize you had to have tickets months in advance. 
When I got there with my family, there was a long

37:36.428 --> 37:40.874
line, and then there was a no line. So I went up to the 
no line because I thought the long line was to buy

37:41.355 --> 37:44.259
tickets. It wasn't. The long line was people 
already had tickets. The no line was people to buy

37:47.263 --> 37:49.746
them, but it was for, like, next year. But the 
maitre d' asked me. He says, you just come back from

37:51.709 --> 37:53.491
Vietnam? And I said, yes. He said, just a minute. He 
took me and my family down. We sat right in the front

37:58.078 --> 37:59.419
row. We got everything on the house. So I was always 
treated with great respect as a soldier. I never

38:08.628 --> 38:13.573
had none of the negative experiences that I hear 
other people relate. And I think maybe it's your

38:13.613 --> 38:14.935
attitude. Who would have dared to have chastised 
me to my face? Maybe I was a crazed Vietnam veteran.

38:24.565 --> 38:26.309
Maybe I would have destroyed them. I don't know. 
Whatever it is, it didn't happen. So I didn't care

38:30.277 --> 38:31.940
about the protesters. I thought it was kind of 
humorous. When I worked on Army General Staff, I

38:32.882 --> 38:37.652
would watch the hippies, and they were totally 
disorganized. Thousands of them would form.

38:40.678 --> 38:44.346
Literally, the third human seed would form 
outside of the Pentagon. Then they would start

38:45.001 --> 38:47.344
running for the Pentagon. But they started 
running way too far back. I knew they'd never make

38:49.626 --> 38:50.607
it. They were all going to be tired out by the time 
they got to where the GSA police were. So here would

38:56.233 --> 39:05.303
come the human sea, running just like they 
probably did at the Battle of Bull Run over the

38:56.233 --> 39:05.303
green plains of the Pentagon. Then out from the 
side of the Pentagon would ride the park police

39:05.323 --> 39:11.970
with their horses, tear gas, and their billy 
clubs. And God, it was hair, eyes, and teeth all

39:12.338 --> 39:15.003
over the place. And what those poor hippies didn't 
know was inside the Pentagon, you know, there was

39:15.504 --> 39:21.275
another battalion of military police. They 
didn't stand a chance from the beginning. And then

39:23.700 --> 39:27.748
I used to laugh because they would chain 
themselves at the door of the Pentagon. And in the

39:28.235 --> 39:37.708
wintertime, it was always my suggestion that we 
help them, that we put a set of handcuffs on them,

39:28.235 --> 39:37.708
because what would happen when they got cold, 
they'd unlock the chains and they'd go get warm. So

39:37.729 --> 39:43.397
I said, let's just put our own handcuffs on them as 
long as they're chained and let them stay

39:37.729 --> 39:43.397
overnight maybe. When I went to the American 
University, I silently protested myself. I went

39:48.063 --> 39:49.986
to the American University, and it was funny. I got 
two master's degrees there, one by being a victim

39:50.046 --> 39:56.335
of a service, one was because of Abraham. The other 
was I finished school, and I never paid much

39:57.091 --> 40:02.657
attention to the regulations, so I didn't check in 
with the Army all the time. When I graduated, they

40:02.677 --> 40:06.001
didn't know I was going to graduate, so they had no 
job for me. So I had to go back for another year and

40:06.781 --> 40:10.726
take another sequence. While I was there, my 
silent protest was that I would, being an

40:10.746 --> 40:20.897
intelligence officer, I've been trained in both 
safe lock manipulation and conventional locks. I

40:21.517 --> 40:24.480
would change the locks on some of the hippies while 
they were demonstrating. I'd change the locks on

40:25.161 --> 40:26.963
their bicycles. and just change them around. And 
then until I had to go to class, I'd sit and watch

40:29.782 --> 40:38.479
them become frustrated and furious because the 
combination wasn't working or the key wouldn't

40:29.782 --> 40:38.479
work in their lock. I don't know what they ever did. 
They'd chain them up real good, and I'd chain the

40:40.463 --> 40:43.669
lock around. That's my way of protesting what they 
were doing. But I never had any vindictiveness. I

40:48.688 --> 40:51.471
didn't give a damn about that. Why did you get 
involved with your mission in 1972 when you were

40:51.491 --> 40:58.000
assigned to Panama to train Latin American 
soldiers in the special forces techniques? Yeah,

40:58.020 --> 40:59.061
it was in 72. That's a wrong thing. I went to Panama 
in 1975. I returned in 1977. I went there because

41:04.668 --> 41:09.454
the Army selected me as a commander. of Special 
Forces in Panama. It was that simple. And I must say

41:13.633 --> 41:22.046
that before I went, because you've got to realize 
I'd been on the Army General Staff, which was a puke

41:13.633 --> 41:22.046
assignment. Before that, I'd been a Command 
General of Staff, College of the University of

41:22.066 --> 41:26.492
Nebraska, a year and a half of Chinese. You know, I 
was academic. When I finally, my wife thought I was

41:30.898 --> 41:38.209
a karate instructor, because if she never saw me in 
a uniform, I went for two years to the American

41:30.898 --> 41:38.209
University. My dad was fully paid by the service. I 
told her, I said, I'm really a soldier. Someday I'm

41:42.612 --> 41:44.053
going to have to go back to work. And I did. Before I 
got ready to go to Panama, knowing what was down

41:46.336 --> 41:54.786
there, I went back up on the mountain again and made 
sure that that was exactly what I wanted to do. And I

41:55.847 --> 41:58.430
was born to be a soldier. I don't know how many 
lifetimes I've lived as a soldier, but that's what

41:58.450 --> 42:04.517
my purpose is in this life. And so I took that 
assignment. It was the best assignment in the

42:07.569 --> 42:08.710
Army. And I enjoyed it. I did a damn good job down 
there with it. And I look forward to doing it again

42:13.295 --> 42:21.224
when I was reassigned to the Pentagon and would 
have had I not been asked to retire. My next job

42:22.005 --> 42:27.771
would have been the 10th Group Commander, which is 
something I always wanted to do.

42:29.489 --> 42:55.750
um what motivated you to get involved with the 
powmia problem because i was asked by general

42:29.489 --> 42:55.750
aaron and when i thought about it it was really it 
was really shocking

42:29.489 --> 42:55.750
and depressing jesus is it possible that this 
great nation of ours could have for political

42:29.489 --> 42:55.750
reasons let live americans dropped between the 
cracks

42:57.113 --> 43:25.939
and when i thought about it and having worked as a 
chief of congressional relations i suddenly

42:57.113 --> 43:25.939
realized you damn right it was possible and once 
you get involved with it it's something you can't

42:57.113 --> 43:25.939
put down for a long time i couldn't eat a meal i 
couldn't go to sleep at night unless i thought

42:57.113 --> 43:25.939
about the condition of those men after a while you 
get fairly hardened to it I've been to Laos three

43:26.172 --> 43:30.385
times now, setting up the rescue. We will rescue 
them. We're going to do it soon. But it certainly is

43:35.723 --> 43:37.466
possible. I used to not think that the president 
even went to the bathroom. I thought he was totally

43:40.911 --> 43:44.536
invulnerable to all of the human frailties. 
That's wrong. He is only going to do what, like any

43:47.120 --> 43:55.633
other servant, what we make him do. And that's why 
the president has discovered POWs in 1983. Not

43:59.179 --> 44:04.667
because they didn't know about them, but because 
the American people has finally brought it to

44:05.018 --> 44:28.950
national attention to the point where all the 
politicians see they better start looking at it so

44:05.018 --> 44:28.950
i got interested in it because i was invited i would 
have loved to have forgotten about the vietnam war

44:05.018 --> 44:28.950
i was very happy in panama i didn't even think about 
vietnam and to revisit a lot of those experiences

44:05.018 --> 44:28.950
was not pleasant for me And to, I don't want to lance 
the festering wound of war that has been healing

44:29.538 --> 44:37.226
for 10 years now. But if you must lance it to let it 
heal cleanly, then let's lance it. This issue is

44:46.235 --> 44:47.917
much like a cancer. The politicians are like 
people who, even though the sickness has been

44:49.038 --> 44:54.263
diagnosed, They don't want to hear it. They don't 
want to treat it because the treatment is onerous

44:56.558 --> 45:00.985
and very difficult. But it's a cancer that I think 
can strangle our moral standards in this country.

45:08.117 --> 45:13.886
If they strangle our moral standards, if it erodes 
that underpinning, what's going to hold us up as a

45:08.117 --> 45:13.886
country? So I think that it is so important that 
like a patient who does have a cancer or sickness we

45:18.205 --> 45:43.588
do whatever we have to do to treat it and to get well 
and that's why i will as anyone who loves a relative

45:18.205 --> 45:43.588
and i love this country i'm going to continue to 
strive to persuade to do what i have to until we do

45:18.205 --> 45:43.588
get well on this issue look at watergate if you 
would have asked nixon he would have told you,

45:44.243 --> 45:47.107
don't do this. As a matter of fact, he did tell us 
that, because you're going to completely erode

45:47.147 --> 45:53.595
the American image in the world. And it was a dark 
period in our history to think that the president

45:54.196 --> 46:00.564
was a crook and a liar. But you know something? We 
emerged a better nation because of it. Now when you

46:05.431 --> 46:12.580
travel overseas, foreigners are amazed that in 
America not even the president can lie and get away

46:05.431 --> 46:12.580
with it. And so it's going to be a dark time in our 
history when we have to reopen the wounds of war in

46:13.235 --> 46:19.543
Vietnam. But damn it, we're going to emerge a 
stronger nation than we were before because of it.

46:26.251 --> 46:28.774
Our moral backbone is going to be reinforced. And 
we're going to be stronger because we did the right

46:29.775 --> 46:38.145
thing instead of sticking our head in the sand and 
letting the cancer eventually kill us. What do you

46:39.205 --> 46:49.559
say to those critics that say that the government 
should more or less take this job over and that

46:39.205 --> 46:49.559
you're just a private citizen and you're just 
trying to do your own thing and you're disturbing

46:39.205 --> 46:49.559
international relations? First of all, I'm 
bulletproof to all criticism because if you're

46:49.840 --> 46:59.072
not in the arena getting bloodied and dirty, then 
you don't count. If you're willing to get in the

46:59.893 --> 47:01.956
arena, then...
