00:03.001 --> 00:09.427
This is an interview with Ron Essig by Mary Cook on 
November 25, 1988, at the home of Ron Essig. In the

00:10.028 --> 00:17.955
interest of accumulating knowledge about the 
war, I am going to donate this tape to the Texas A&M

00:10.028 --> 00:17.955
Oral History Collection and the University 
Archives. Is that all right with you? Mm-hmm.

00:20.537 --> 00:22.799
Okay. Okay, the first question is, where were you 
born? Reading, Pennsylvania. Okay. And when were

00:27.684 --> 00:28.585
you born? What year? 1948. And where did you go to 
school? Wilson High School, West Long,

00:34.988 --> 00:37.951
Pennsylvania. Okay. And did you attend college? 
No. And when and where did you join the military? I

00:44.957 --> 00:48.260
joined it in Pennsylvania in August of 1966. And 
what was the reason for joining the military?

00:55.047 --> 00:56.548
There was no main reason. I just went and joined. 
Did you join... Because of Vietnam? No, that had

01:03.072 --> 01:04.995
nothing to do with it. And what was the extent of 
your military training before arriving in

01:06.297 --> 01:10.002
Vietnam? Well, I took my basic training. I took 
helicopter training in Fort Rucker, Alabama, and

01:13.186 --> 01:19.696
then from there I went right to Vietnam. And what 
were your feelings when you found out you were

01:21.038 --> 01:24.603
being sent to Vietnam?

01:27.366 --> 01:29.910
Well, I was scared at first, but... There was 
nothing I could do about it, so I went.

01:36.193 --> 01:46.685
And what were the sentiments, did you feel, in the 
country at the time that you were sent to Vietnam,

01:36.193 --> 01:46.685
as far as what were... Did you feel there was a lot of 
anti-war sentiment at the time? Was it prevalent

01:46.745 --> 01:50.469
in Pennsylvania, or...? Not really. When I went to 
Vietnam, it really wasn't that much. So it was

01:59.101 --> 02:00.983
still a positive attitude. Right. We felt we 
should be in Vietnam. Right. After I was over

02:03.226 --> 02:05.628
there, that's when it really got started.

02:08.712 --> 02:10.874
Okay. What was your initial reaction upon 
arriving in Vietnam? Well, it wasn't what I

02:15.800 --> 02:18.343
expected. I expected to see bullets flying, but it 
was nothing like that. I mean, where I reported

02:23.449 --> 02:27.353
into in Vietnam was... what they called a coal 
area. It was an induction center. And I was there

02:33.938 --> 02:39.044
about four days before I got sent to my company. I 
really didn't see any action until I was there

02:40.245 --> 02:49.135
about a month, I guess, when we first finally got 
hit by mortars. And where were you? What part of

02:50.837 --> 02:52.699
Vietnam were you at the time? In the northern part, 
in the highlands, at Da Nang.

02:58.125 --> 02:58.285
Da Nang. Did you, were you around the people, the 
Vietnamese people at all? How did you feel about

03:02.948 --> 03:04.270
the people? Around the Vietnamese people all the 
time. They, well, I was just amazed how the people

03:06.754 --> 03:11.020
lived. You know, it was such a poor country. And I 
just couldn't comprehend how they could live the

03:13.704 --> 03:19.192
way they did. You know, of course, being, you know, 
from the United States and everything, we had

03:20.374 --> 03:25.521
everything we wanted. And then going to a country 
like that where it was so poor and their way of life,

03:26.513 --> 03:35.200
I just took a while for it to sink in. Did you try, I 
don't know, some units, we've had people talk to

03:36.561 --> 03:50.613
us, some of the men would help the villagers or the 
natives around where they were as far as the

03:36.561 --> 03:50.613
different things to improve their living. Were 
you involved with that at all? No, our company was.

03:54.476 --> 03:56.318
We were an aviation company.

04:02.963 --> 04:08.252
Okay, do you feel you understood the Vietnamese 
people and their culture at all? Do you feel you

04:08.392 --> 04:15.624
understood why they lived the way they did and they 
were happy with the way they were living,

04:08.392 --> 04:15.624
apparently? Oh, yeah, they were definitely 
happy. Well, I mean, it was their way of life.

04:23.237 --> 04:24.980
Right. As far as the war... No, they weren't happy 
with that. Was it because we were there? Were they

04:31.096 --> 04:32.738
not happy with our presence? Would they have 
rather fought the war themselves? No, I didn't

04:34.922 --> 04:36.164
take it that way. I'm

04:36.224 --> 04:43.175
cut for words now.

04:47.342 --> 04:53.912
I never felt that much hatred toward the American 
GI while I was there.

04:55.158 --> 04:59.142
In a sense, you know, they were glad that we were 
there helping them and everything. But when it

05:00.664 --> 05:11.816
came really down to the fighting, I mean, you get to 
the soldier of the South Vietnamese Army, I felt

05:00.664 --> 05:11.816
like he could have done more if he would have tried 
harder. But as far as the civilian people,

05:12.677 --> 05:19.144
yeah, I feel like they were pleased that we were 
there. And what unit were you in? 282nd Assault

05:23.288 --> 05:26.432
Helicopter Company. Okay. And what was your 
mission? Resupply, medevac, troop lift. So you

05:32.360 --> 05:35.784
were carrying out supplies to troops? Right. We 
supported the 1st Arvin Division, the South

05:37.246 --> 05:40.571
Vietnamese soldiers. Okay. And was that 
division, the Arvin Division, did you find they

05:42.573 --> 05:49.562
were well-trained, well-equipped to deal with 
what was going on? Well... As far as the training,

05:53.326 --> 06:00.314
no, they didn't have very good training, but they 
were supplied by the United States government. I

06:00.334 --> 06:01.656
mean, they were American weapons. Right. And how 
long were you in Vietnam? A year and a half. And as

06:08.665 --> 06:18.216
far as usually we're under the impression, or I'm 
under the impression, that most people were only

06:08.665 --> 06:18.216
over there for a year. Right. And is there a reason 
why you were over there Well, when it was time for my

06:21.743 --> 06:32.493
year was up, I had

06:21.743 --> 06:32.493
about 16 months to go in the service yet. And I knew 
if I'd come back to the States, I'd only be back a few

06:33.654 --> 06:39.039
months and I'd have to go right back to Vietnam 
again. So I just stayed an additional six months

06:40.661 --> 06:48.628
and then came back to the States and get out of the 
service when I got back.

06:50.397 --> 06:56.125
How did you and your unit, okay, you were a supply 
unit. Could you describe to me exactly what that

06:56.305 --> 06:59.710
entailed as far as? Well, as far as supply, we'd 
resupply them with weapons, ammunition, medical

07:00.551 --> 07:08.782
supplies, food. So you'd fly out to the different 
areas and drop off these supplies and then come

07:10.084 --> 07:17.814
back to the base area, which was Da Nang? Mm-hmm. 
And did you see a lot of, when

07:19.203 --> 07:31.180
you landed, when you tried to drop off supplies and 
that kind of thing, were you under fire a lot of

07:19.203 --> 07:31.180
times or? About 50% of the time. We've seen quite a 
bit of hostile fire. Okay. What was the training of

07:41.295 --> 07:42.997
your unit? Were all the men in your unit Did they go 
through the same training that you did back in the

07:46.304 --> 07:49.688
States? No. Well, the ones that went to the 
training I did were the crew chiefs and the

07:52.432 --> 07:55.776
mechanics. And then we had gunners. They 
consisted mostly of infantry. One gunner I had was

08:02.205 --> 08:13.780
with the 1st Infantry Division, and he 
transferred to the aviation unit to be a door

08:02.205 --> 08:13.780
gunner. And that was his main duty, was just a 
gunner. Take care of the guns. It was my job to

08:20.268 --> 08:23.373
maintain the helicopter and see that it would fly. 
And then while we were flying, and then I was a

08:23.413 --> 08:26.017
gunner.

08:33.248 --> 08:43.463
Would you say that the training that you had then 
prepared you for, I mean, as far as not for the war

08:33.248 --> 08:43.463
aspect, not for what you expected when you got 
there, but... the training that you did have, you

08:43.527 --> 08:49.933
were prepared when you were over there to do your 
job, your specific job of taking care of the

08:43.527 --> 08:49.933
helicopter. Yeah,

08:50.133 --> 08:54.297
definitely. And going back now, going back to 
different battles in Vietnam, you were over there

08:55.618 --> 09:04.906
during Tet. What was your first reaction to Tet?

09:11.332 --> 09:11.712
Well,

09:16.450 --> 09:18.132
It was very hostile, I know that. When it initially 
started, it wasn't too bad for me. Well, I mean, as

09:24.521 --> 09:38.641
far as our company, the ones that were stationed at 
Da Nang, we had, we kept, our main base was at Da

09:24.521 --> 09:38.641
Nang, and we kept helicopters to the north at Way 
Citadel and helicopters to the south at Quang

09:24.521 --> 09:38.641
Ngai. And we really didn't get into the heavy 
fighting of it until they more or less overran

09:39.963 --> 09:45.951
Way... Rover ran away Citadel. And then that's 
when we really had to get in some heavy fighting.

09:52.213 --> 09:52.494
Then... So that was your unit that got into it. 
Right. And I was scared then. And did you fly on

10:00.306 --> 10:03.430
these... You were out on these missions then? Oh, 
yeah. Got in some really heavy fighting then.

10:11.303 --> 10:11.523
And... So, did you think... Well, did you know it 
was coming? Did you have any idea what that tap was

10:17.601 --> 10:22.068
going to occur? They tried to prepare us for it, but

10:22.769 --> 10:43.782
I don't think, as far as the commanding officers in 
our company, I don't think they realized it would

10:22.769 --> 10:43.782
be as intense as it was and it would last as long as it 
did, which I can't tell the exact amount of days

10:22.769 --> 10:43.782
that it lasted, but I honestly believe that they 
only figured it would last maybe five or six days.

10:50.471 --> 10:50.631
Right. And it carried way beyond that. So it was an 
intensive period of fighting for an extensive

10:53.976 --> 10:58.603
period of time. It was fighting 24 hours a day. And 
the U.S., you don't believe that the U.S. actually

11:03.411 --> 11:09.960
knew what they were getting into when they carried 
out this? Well... I think the intelligence part

11:11.555 --> 11:26.539
probably did, but like I said, as far as the 
commanding officers of the company that I was in, I

11:11.555 --> 11:26.539
don't think they knew it was gonna be that bad. 
Okay, and how did you... You said you were scared

11:26.559 --> 11:32.569
about the fighting, the intensive fighting. How 
did... What other feelings were going through

11:32.609 --> 11:36.876
your mind? I mean... personal feelings, and this 
is a difficult question, but... Well, if you're

11:39.297 --> 11:51.815
trying to ask me, the question is, did I think we 
should have been over there? No, that's a question

11:52.396 --> 11:54.258
later on. But did you personally, at the time of 
Tet, when you were doing this fighting, when you

11:55.560 --> 12:08.038
were involved in the intensive fighting in your 
unit, besides being scared, do you remember any

11:55.560 --> 12:08.038
other feelings that were going through your mind? 
Or just get out of there and get home. That's all I

12:11.218 --> 12:12.522
was concerned about. And you had, at that time, you 
had about ten, nine, nine months left, was it?

12:17.074 --> 12:20.203
Yeah, it was about nine months. And what about your 
choice to go ahead and stay over there? Did you feel

12:22.489 --> 12:23.633
that that was... I still felt like I made the right 
choice. What were the, after Tet, what was the

12:27.593 --> 12:35.784
feeling of your unit, of the troops, of the US 
troops in Vietnam? Were they more enthusiastic

12:36.225 --> 12:42.594
because Tet was supposedly a win for us? Oh, 
definitely. So they were more enthusiastic about

12:44.056 --> 12:46.439
being in Vietnam? Yeah, I feel they were. And did it 
motivate you personally, Tet? In a sense, I guess

12:54.931 --> 12:56.773
it did, yeah. I don't know. I figured if I could make 
it through that mess, I can make it through

13:01.416 --> 13:11.526
anything and just get home and forget about it. 
What was the military leadership like? What were

13:14.269 --> 13:16.251
your commanding officers like? Were they trained 
for Vietnam? Were they experienced with war? Oh,

13:23.258 --> 13:23.739
yeah. We had... quite a number of them that were on 
their second and third tours over there. You know,

13:30.618 --> 13:38.171
they knew what it was about and they worked with the 
men to make sure that they got through it.

13:41.176 --> 13:43.460
So you feel like their leadership was adequate? 
Oh, yeah.

13:48.709 --> 13:50.031
Did they ever ask the men in your unit to do 
something which you felt or the men in your unit

13:51.040 --> 13:57.606
felt was totally unreasonable. I know in the 
military there's supposedly no room for, you do

13:58.607 --> 14:18.887
what you're told and there's no room for 
questioning, but in one of the books that we had

13:58.607 --> 14:18.887
read, and I know this wasn't in your unit, it wasn't 
a duty of yours, but they were to search the tunnels

13:58.607 --> 14:18.887
and they always had to search the tunnels. I'm just 
wondering if there was anything that the

14:19.981 --> 14:33.557
leadership in your unit told you to do that was 
putting the men in your unit's life in danger more

14:19.981 --> 14:33.557
than... Not that I really recall. Everything just 
clicked along pretty smooth. Okay. Was there a

14:41.366 --> 14:44.750
problem with drug use in your unit? Yeah, quite a 
bit. Why do you think drugs were such a major factor

14:47.318 --> 14:54.105
in the Vietnam War with men? I think a lot of guys 
feared they had to have it to get through it. So it

14:58.530 --> 14:59.572
was a crutch. It was a big hide to them. It just, I 
don't know, maybe made them face reality or

15:03.916 --> 15:08.902
something. I don't know. Marijuana was a big 
demand. Marijuana. Yeah. Were other drugs in use

15:15.972 --> 15:17.914
at the time? Not that I know of. And it was readily 
available? Oh, yeah. You just go downtown and buy

15:24.922 --> 15:27.625
that like you buy a pack of cigarettes. And what 
about the commanding officers? They obviously

15:31.550 --> 15:33.692
knew. Oh, sure they knew. And did they use it also?

15:39.900 --> 15:40.901
That I really don't know. I've never seen them do 
it. But What they did on their free time was their

15:45.183 --> 15:47.066
business.

15:51.855 --> 15:53.198
Okay. Was there, okay, you said this was in some of 
the commanding officers, this was their second or

15:53.218 --> 15:58.788
third tour. Was that because of careerism? Were 
they in the military as a career? Yeah.

16:07.504 --> 16:08.406
And did you? were you aware of or did you see any 
altering of official reports? In some instances,

16:13.721 --> 16:18.509
as in body counts, body counts were upped as far as 
the enemy. Conditions weren't reported as being

16:20.453 --> 16:24.379
as bad as they were. Some conditions were reported 
very optimistically in order for their

16:24.439 --> 16:32.212
backgrounds to look better. Did you see that 
happening? I haven't seen it happen, no.

16:42.372 --> 16:49.298
Do you have any particular operation which you 
consider the least successful of your unit?

16:54.043 --> 16:54.643
Not really. It seemed like everything we did was, 
well, to me, everything we did seemed successful.

17:04.892 --> 17:08.656
I mean, we never lost that many people.

17:11.378 --> 17:12.379
Not while I was over there. And what happened 
before I was there or after I was there, I really

17:13.760 --> 17:17.305
don't know. Right. I mean, we lost some people, but 
we didn't lose that many. So, you know, if you go out

17:22.472 --> 17:28.401
on a mission and come back with as many people going 
out, it was a success. Right. And you consider the

17:29.382 --> 17:32.987
number of people you lost to be? It was a minimum. 
Minimum. Okay. And is there any particular

17:36.032 --> 17:39.617
mission you consider the most successful? Or 
would you just write them all down? I'd read them

17:43.578 --> 17:45.000
all about the same, really. About the same.

17:48.685 --> 17:58.920
Okay, and you were, when we were talking about the 
Vietnamese, and you said, you, did you feel like

17:48.685 --> 17:58.920
you understood the Vietnamese as far as the people 
go? You said you did not. Was that correct? I mean,

18:01.824 --> 18:05.710
as far as, because you didn't understand why they 
lived the way they did. Well, I knew why they lived

18:06.071 --> 18:08.734
the way they did, because they were poor. It was a 
poor country. It was communism. But they seemed

18:11.198 --> 18:12.640
happy living that way. That's how they lived all 
their life. Okay. How did you feel about the Arvin?

18:23.737 --> 18:24.337
They were lazy. Really. You know, like I said 
earlier, their training could have been a lot

18:27.061 --> 18:30.586
better.

18:33.390 --> 18:37.215
Do you blame their lack of training on their lack of 
ambition? Yeah. Because if we take a troop lift

18:40.900 --> 18:42.542
out, We drop off the first wave of troops, go back up 
and pick the second wave up, and we come right back

18:43.180 --> 18:50.232
to where we were the first ones. The first one was 
still sitting there. I mean, they didn't even make

18:53.036 --> 18:54.539
an effort to move. It looked like they were just 
going out on a camping trip. That was it. They were

18:58.466 --> 19:04.716
already cooking their rice, so, you know, there 
was definitely a lack of effort.

19:11.513 --> 19:24.790
And do you feel like we should have just, you said 
they're lazy, do you feel, I mean, you were out

19:11.513 --> 19:24.790
there, you were putting your life on the line, and 
you dropped them off and they'd sit there. I mean,

19:25.050 --> 19:30.718
did you feel like you should have just said, well, 
bye, I'm going home and left? I mean, you know, do

19:31.118 --> 19:39.529
you feel like we should have just said bye and let 
them fight their own war and take care of it the way

19:31.118 --> 19:39.529
they wanted to? Well, at first I didn't think that, 
but when it came close to the end of my tour, then I

19:42.091 --> 19:52.245
realized what was going on. So after you've been 
over there over a year. Right, you know, when

19:54.188 --> 20:02.539
you're there your first six months, you know, you 
have to be there that long to see what's really

19:54.188 --> 20:02.539
going on. You just can't see it in one or two days. 
But when it came close to the end of my tour, I

20:06.725 --> 20:11.912
just... I figured it was just a waste, which it 
really was. So,

20:16.872 --> 20:27.565
basically, I guess the next question is, do you 
resent putting your life on the line? Do you resent

20:27.866 --> 20:30.990
the time that you spent 18 months over there? The 
first six months, it took you six months to figure

20:31.050 --> 20:37.238
out what was going on. Then you dropped these men 
off. They didn't do what they were supposed to do.

20:42.672 --> 20:49.218
We were over there, we were supplying them, 
equipping them, spending millions, millions of

20:42.672 --> 20:49.218
dollars. Do you resent being over there? Do you 
resent that 18 months of your life? No, I don't

20:54.023 --> 20:55.244
resent being there. I did something I had to do. The 
United States government said, hey, you're going

20:58.447 --> 21:01.911
to Vietnam, and that was it. So I served my time just 
like anybody else did. There was no sense in

21:05.194 --> 21:08.517
protesting it. It wouldn't do no good. So I did my 
duty and that was it. How do you feel, or how did you

21:15.458 --> 21:18.882
feel about the North Vietnamese Army? How, what 
were their, do you feel like they were that much

21:20.464 --> 21:28.794
better trained, equipped than the South? Well,

21:31.057 --> 21:35.162
they were trained better. They were much more 
disciplined.

21:41.920 --> 21:52.236
When it came up to Ted, and they started coming down 
from the north, I mean they were, they were running

21:41.920 --> 21:52.236
short on troops and stuff. I mean they were sending 
12, 13 year old children down to fight. But they

21:57.424 --> 21:58.565
were still disciplined. They did what they were 
told to do. And as far as their weapons, yeah I think

22:03.012 --> 22:09.181
they had pretty good weapons. They were all 
communist made. From what we captured of them,

22:13.088 --> 22:16.932
they seemed like pretty decent weapons. How were 
they treated when they were captured? Not too

22:22.238 --> 22:22.818
good.

22:27.603 --> 22:28.904
Can you give me a specific?

22:31.387 --> 22:33.069
Well, they were bounced around pretty good. You 
know, if they captured three or four of them, they

22:33.569 --> 22:38.995
wouldn't talk. They'd bounce one of them around 
pretty good to make the others talk. So it was a

22:45.713 --> 22:49.696
pretty tough interrogation they put them 
through. Now, that was the Vietnamese that did the

22:51.939 --> 22:54.081
interrogating. Now, I never saw how the Americans 
interrogated them. So this was the South

22:59.105 --> 23:01.508
Vietnamese interrogating the North? Right, the 
South Vietnamese that interrogated them. They

23:04.570 --> 23:08.374
had no mercy on them, which I'm sure it was the same 
way with the North.

23:12.033 --> 23:14.016
And how did you feel about the Viet Cong? Since you 
really couldn't, how did you pick the Viet Cong?

23:21.306 --> 23:24.330
How did you pick out Viet Cong from the Arvin? Well, 
they were, the Viet Cong, they were, you could tell

23:26.232 --> 23:30.258
them. They mostly wore black pajamas and stuff. 
Where the South Vietnamese Army, they wore green

23:33.482 --> 23:39.390
fatigues and stuff like we did. Hey, that sucker 
had a gun. He was pointing it at me. It was either him

23:44.480 --> 23:45.261
or me. Was there a lot of Arvin by day and Viet Cong by 
night? That kind of thing? That I really couldn't

23:53.714 --> 23:55.236
tell you. I don't know. There was a lot of stories 
about it.

24:07.838 --> 24:15.347
OK, now back to the President of the United States 
and different policies that he had at the time.

24:15.387 --> 24:18.070
What about during Vietnam? What about LBJ and his, 
we're going to bomb only certain places and you

24:18.110 --> 24:25.599
have to ask my permission to bomb? And it was 
basically for a time, I don't know when you were

24:27.201 --> 24:35.331
over there or how it ran, but for a time it was a nine 
to five war, basically. And it was not fought

24:35.564 --> 24:37.346
during the holidays. Right. How did you feel about 
that? It was a war. I mean... Well, as far as the

24:40.591 --> 24:47.861
bombing, I didn't agree with the way he did it.

24:47.881 --> 24:54.190
I think if he had just went out there and bombed the 
north and got it over with, it probably would have

24:47.881 --> 24:54.190
ended a lot quicker. That's my feeling. I might be 
wrong. I don't know. But as far as bombing here and

24:57.855 --> 25:04.744
bombing there and shutting it down for so many days 
and then reasonable, start the bombing again. I

25:07.017 --> 25:07.778
didn't agree with it. Like I said, they just would 
have went in there with a squadron of bombers and

25:09.561 --> 25:14.467
unloaded on them. I think they could have stopped 
it. And as far as that getting clearance to fire,

25:18.512 --> 25:24.079
I've been through that too many times. You know, 
you see something on the ground, you know it's not

25:25.621 --> 25:35.254
right, then you have to call in for clearance to 
fire and it'd take anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes to

25:25.621 --> 25:35.254
get clearance. It's all gone. So did you always get 
clearance to fire? Sometimes we did. Sometimes we

25:43.373 --> 25:44.134
didn't.

25:47.779 --> 25:49.462
We didn't take matters into our own hands. And you 
did what you felt was right. And sometimes we'd

25:53.809 --> 26:00.058
even have a South Vietnamese commanding officer 
on board, but we'd still have to call for

25:53.809 --> 26:00.058
clearance. We couldn't get clearance. He'd give 
us a word, go ahead and fire, so we'd fire.

26:08.275 --> 26:11.500
Was this the attitude of your whole unit? I mean, 
was, as far as the policies?

26:19.951 --> 26:27.221
Were the men in your unit, did they feel the same way 
about the bombing policy and about clearing,

26:19.951 --> 26:27.221
getting clearance to fire and that kind of thing? 
Oh, yeah. The whole company felt the same about it.

26:36.068 --> 26:42.758
What did you think about the government's role in 
Vietnam as far as LBJ's policy? Later on, Nixon,

26:43.980 --> 26:52.532
when he said he was going to withdraw troops and 
then we invaded Cambodia, how did you feel

26:43.980 --> 26:52.532
about... It was very political, the whole thing. 
How did you feel about that as far as... It was more

26:59.963 --> 27:03.448
politics running the war than the military was 
running the war. Do you feel like the military...

27:05.768 --> 27:14.600
The upper officers really had any kind of control, 
or do you think they were more controlled by what

27:05.768 --> 27:14.600
was politically happening in the United States? 
It was all run from Washington. I mean, the

27:16.682 --> 27:26.876
commanding officers, I mean, of our company, they 
had to take orders from battalion. Battalion had

27:26.936 --> 27:31.742
to take them from there higher up. So it was 
definitely politics. We had no control. We had to

27:37.060 --> 27:41.686
do what we were told to do, and that was it. Okay. 
Were you aware when you were over in Vietnam of the

27:44.069 --> 27:49.595
media involvement in the war? Did you know what was 
being broadcast in the United States about the

27:50.236 --> 27:54.381
war? Not when I was over there, I didn't. I didn't 
realize it until I got home. Were there any

28:00.849 --> 28:02.691
media... around TV reporters, camera, newspaper 
photographers, that kind of thing. Did you ever

28:09.094 --> 28:11.617
see any while you were in? No,

28:11.637 --> 28:17.503
I never saw any. Were you aware of the anti-war 
sentiment that was increasing in the United

28:17.523 --> 28:26.733
States while you were in Vietnam? Yeah. And how did 
that? My parents used to send me newspaper

28:27.473 --> 28:31.918
clippings of it.

28:35.240 --> 28:46.193
kind of made me mad, knowing that I was over there 
trying to serve my country and then had these

28:35.240 --> 28:46.193
protesters back in the States going against the 
war. Then you had some that went to Canada trying to

28:47.735 --> 28:50.598
avoid the war. So,

28:52.741 --> 28:56.645
yeah, I was mad. And what did your parents say about 
you being in Vietnam? Did they support you being in

29:03.153 --> 29:05.095
Vietnam? Or when you came home, did they not want to 
hear about your Vietnam experiences? Oh, they

29:13.154 --> 29:14.276
wanted to hear about them. You know, but at first I 
couldn't talk about it. I just, something I had to

29:19.903 --> 29:21.685
get out of my mind. Now,

29:21.705 --> 29:29.495
it was kind of tough for my parents because it was 
myself and my brother, we were both over at the same

29:21.705 --> 29:29.495
time. So it was kind of hard on my parents. But, uh, 
As far as when we came back, I mean, there was no hard

29:37.677 --> 29:43.866
feelings or anything like that. Did you, when you 
came back, what was your reception? I don't know.

29:51.336 --> 29:52.819
You went back to Pennsylvania. Mm-hmm. Were you 
from a small town in Pennsylvania? No, it was a

29:57.826 --> 29:58.687
pretty good-sized city. Pretty good-sized. And 
what about the people you knew? How did they treat

30:01.491 --> 30:04.896
you when you came back? Well, at first... I don't 
know, I guess they might have thought I was going to

30:07.023 --> 30:11.510
come back whacked out or something. I don't know. 
At first they were just kind of easy. They were kind

30:16.438 --> 30:19.263
of careful what they said and stuff. But after

30:19.283 --> 30:26.475
I was home a while, it just more or less tapered out 
like it used to be. Good old drinking buddies and

30:28.298 --> 30:30.942
stuff. The only experience that I really had that 
kind of really hit me was when I flew from

30:35.373 --> 30:39.119
California to Pennsylvania. I was on a plane and a 
woman looked at me and just, for no reason at all,

30:39.139 --> 30:49.677
she just looked at me and called me a child 
murderer. I guess because it was a Vietnam man. I

30:54.064 --> 30:55.006
wasn't gonna let it bother me. I was going home. So 
you wore your uniform from California to

30:57.831 --> 31:01.617
Pennsylvania? And when this woman said that to 
you, it was, what could you say? It was a shock at

31:08.613 --> 31:11.838
first, you know, hey, wait a minute, I didn't kill 
no kids. But that's just the way that people were.

31:16.844 --> 31:19.848
You know, the Vietnam vet, he took a bad rap. It's 
just been the last few years that they've really

31:21.730 --> 31:25.815
been doing something for him.

31:33.052 --> 31:38.721
You mentioned about people that chose Canada 
instead of serving their country. How do you feel

31:41.205 --> 31:42.928
about those people? If you met somebody that came 
up to you and said, oh, you're a Vietnam War vet,

31:44.069 --> 31:51.621
well, I went to Canada instead, what would you say 
to that person? I don't think I'd say anything to

31:51.781 --> 31:53.905
them. Just for the satisfaction, I'd probably 
smack them in the mouth and get it over with. You

31:59.273 --> 32:00.375
know, it was... my way of thinking he was a coward. 
You know, hey, if I'm good enough to serve my

32:06.166 --> 32:09.269
country, so is he. I lived through it. Do you think 
that's part of being a citizen of the United

32:11.871 --> 32:17.095
States, to serve your country? Even if you don't 
feel the reason for... Well, I feel like it is.

32:22.200 --> 32:23.721
...being involved is correct? Right.

32:29.326 --> 32:32.168
When we were talking about politics involved in 
the war, And the anti-war movement, do you feel the

32:32.992 --> 32:41.202
anti-war movement was more against what was 
occurring in Washington than against the

32:32.992 --> 32:41.202
military? Do you think people were really against 
the military, or is it just the government policy

32:41.222 --> 32:46.529
at the time? I think they were against the 
government. That's what I think.

32:55.741 --> 32:59.826
And you said you wore your uniform from when you got 
back into the state. And some people came back to

33:01.966 --> 33:06.953
the States from Vietnam, some veterans. One 
incident, he took his uniform off as soon as he got

33:09.035 --> 33:15.704
into California before he went home. Some of them 
have joined anti-war movements when they got back

33:17.507 --> 33:25.558
to the States. They were not proud about their role 
in Vietnam. Can you say that you are proud of your

33:28.301 --> 33:31.045
role in Vietnam? Yeah, I was proud of what I did. I 
served my country. They sent me over there to do a

33:37.961 --> 33:39.364
job. I felt like I did a job.

33:45.434 --> 33:57.133
Would you say that Vietnam, the reason for us being 
in Vietnam and or the people were worth dying for if

33:45.434 --> 33:57.133
you had lost or killing for when you were over 
there?

34:00.438 --> 34:17.361
As far as stopping communism, yeah, it was worth 
it, but for the people that were there, and like I

34:00.438 --> 34:17.361
said, after the way I saw how they operated, I mean, 
as far as the military,

34:00.438 --> 34:17.361
no, I can't agree with that. Not on the part of the 
South Vietnamese military. If they'd have tried

34:22.909 --> 34:24.771
harder, they could have done it. But when the 
United States pulled out, they just... More or

34:29.429 --> 34:33.354
less threw up their hands and said, hey, here we 
are. That's the way it looked to me. Right. Do you

34:35.196 --> 34:43.625
think if we would have pulled out, or if we hadn't 
been over there, or we would have pulled out

34:35.196 --> 34:43.625
sooner, do you think they would have just done the 
same thing, just said, well, forget it? Yeah, I

34:44.026 --> 34:49.813
think they

34:44.026 --> 34:49.813
would have. What are your views on the Selective 
Service, on National Guard? What about the men

34:58.252 --> 35:12.850
that joined the National Guard instead of, well, 
after a period of time, they weren't allowed in the

34:58.252 --> 35:12.850
National Guard anyways, but...

34:58.252 --> 35:12.850
Well, I won't hold anything against them for it.

35:16.635 --> 35:18.077
Somebody had to go in the National Guard. Might 
sound like a stupid answer, but... No, I don't hold

35:19.859 --> 35:25.947
anything against anybody who went in the National 
Guard.

35:29.960 --> 35:32.043
And what about the Selective Service? Did you feel 
like they were trained?

35:39.976 --> 35:46.305
Did you feel like they did their job, that they were 
trained

35:39.976 --> 35:46.305
better? No. I think they did all right. I mean, they 
did what they were told to do. They were trained to

35:52.375 --> 35:54.398
do that job, and that's what they did.

35:57.871 --> 36:01.374
And the last question is, do you think we could have 
won the war?

36:06.459 --> 36:07.541
That's a hard one to answer.

36:13.306 --> 36:16.089
In fact, that's the first time anybody's ever 
asked me that question.

36:19.192 --> 36:20.233
Yeah, I think we could have. Well, we'll go right 
back to the bombing again. If they would have

36:25.618 --> 36:27.220
continued the bombing, And kept bombing and 
bombing and bombing. Eventually, yeah, they

36:30.182 --> 36:34.688
would have got him down to where we could have beat 
him. So going back to the very, not the very

36:35.770 --> 36:50.749
beginning, but to LBJ's getting us more involved 
to his policy on bombing, if we would have just gone

36:35.770 --> 36:50.749
over there and bombed... I think so. It would have 
taken care of it. I think it would have. And we would

36:55.094 --> 36:56.536
have been out of there a lot sooner. I feel like we 
would have, yeah. Would have saved a lot more lives

36:58.823 --> 37:00.205
too.

37:03.569 --> 37:03.669
Okay. Is there any... Is there anything I haven't 
touched on that maybe you'd like to... No, you hit a

37:03.689 --> 37:15.162
lot more than

37:03.689 --> 37:15.162
I thought you were going to hit. Are there any 
experiences that...

37:15.182 --> 37:21.610
Not really. How do you feel today about... I know I 
said that was the last question, but... About the

37:28.355 --> 37:36.125
movies that are out about Vietnam, there's, well, 
there was Good Morning Vietnam. There's

37:37.847 --> 37:46.077
Hamburger Hill, Platoon, Rambo. Well,

37:46.118 --> 37:55.189
I've seen nearly all of them.

37:58.392 --> 38:01.817
And the closest thing that I've seen in the movies 
to Vietnam was Platoon. Platoon? Mm-hmm. Of

38:05.142 --> 38:06.484
course, now that was all infantry. I didn't get 
into the jungles like they did.

38:14.054 --> 38:20.524
And that good morning Vietnam, it was... That was 
more of a political... On a scale of one to ten, I

38:14.054 --> 38:20.524
give it a zero.

38:24.369 --> 38:26.492
But it, no, it doesn't have any effect on me. I 
imagine some of these Vietnam vets it probably

38:28.058 --> 38:30.507
does.

38:37.331 --> 38:38.997
Well, thank you very much.
