WEBVTT

00:11.084 --> 00:31.750
He

00:11.084 --> 00:31.750
had written a lot about my experience in the past. 
When he took me there, and he was taking me there, he

00:31.770 --> 00:33.292
was only 20 years old. He had a sort of age 
difference. .

01:04.728 --> 01:04.748
. . . . .

01:31.335 --> 01:31.355
. .

01:39.087 --> 01:51.920
After the ouster of Prince Sinepa, what effect did 
the new government have on Cambodia's

01:39.087 --> 01:51.920
relationships with the communists in the USA? Did 
Long Nol change the policies with dealing with the

01:53.882 --> 02:02.270
communists? No. At that time, after the ouster of 
Prince Sinepa, and

02:08.922 --> 02:22.977
Donald was the Prime Minister, you know. And we 
tried, you know, we tried to maintain our

02:22.997 --> 02:34.109
relationship with communism, and we asked to 
renew the relationship with your country. But

02:34.130 --> 02:38.254
your country has suffered, but the communism has 
suffered. We are willing to do that. On that time,

02:42.987 --> 02:51.636
not only the community

02:42.987 --> 02:51.636
science. Right. Were y'all still trying to 
continue your policy of neutrality? Yeah,

02:57.643 --> 03:01.828
because now we know All the Portuguese have some 
problems,

03:02.382 --> 03:23.847
not really good, you know, but now we know, we study 
the best ways, that's all. Because if we don't like

03:23.867 --> 03:30.415
to have American base or Russian base or Chinese 
base or Cambodians, to build our economic

03:31.323 --> 03:44.662
province.

03:44.682 --> 03:49.129
Did you and Long Nol have the same goals for 
Cambodia? Yes, we have the same goals for

03:51.452 --> 03:57.060
Cambodia. But

03:57.682 --> 04:07.494
overall, y'all worked well together, would you 
say? What

04:08.736 --> 04:22.693
was your reaction? to the April 1970 invasion of 
Cambodia by American troops. This, you know, this

04:30.367 --> 04:52.157
bad propaganda

04:30.367 --> 04:52.157
from communists,

04:30.367 --> 04:52.157
really, we are going to go to protect them, you 
know? Why jump

04:52.627 --> 05:00.461
from the attention? We ask you to go to heaven. But 
we have to fight with the government. We don't like

05:07.554 --> 05:09.297
that. We don't accept that. We know about that. We 
don't like to accept that. the

05:15.728 --> 05:27.305
government to let the Chinese occupy the border of 
the country.

05:30.529 --> 05:43.288
We don't like to accept the government to let the 
military transport the ammunition or food across

05:30.529 --> 05:43.288
our country. So

05:43.471 --> 06:06.930
did you consider Americans'

05:43.471 --> 06:06.930
invasion more as a protection measure for 
Cambodia against the communists?

06:07.400 --> 06:26.779
Unfortunately, last time I didn't let, because my 
country is the last country, you know, we're going

06:07.400 --> 06:26.779
to have, you know, another time, another time, a 
lot of involvement in the Congress here, you know.

06:26.799 --> 06:29.582
We don't let the American troops go to Cambodia. We 
don't let the Cambodian, you know, to planning or

06:33.657 --> 06:41.749
something, you know, military American to plan. 
They had to send our soldiers to plan Vietnam and

06:42.130 --> 06:48.139
Thailand and all countries, you know. And I talked 
to, at that time, I was in Phu Quoc, I know if you have

06:48.159 --> 06:58.315
some Phu Quoc and all countries to send a 
technician or some military Cambodian to Paris,

06:58.885 --> 07:15.055
So

06:58.885 --> 07:15.055
were you expecting more support from America than 
you actually got? You know, but unfortunately,

07:15.305 --> 07:30.940
you know, a lot of the congressmen was against the 
war, you know. But I, when I go to church, I agree,

07:30.961 --> 07:40.630
but don't forget in your religion, the best way to 
protect your country is to attack, you know. If you

07:41.511 --> 07:43.573
are afraid to attack, you know, He had

07:44.144 --> 07:49.629
a lot of power. And now, you know, the people are 
happy about that. Reagan, now, he's afraid to say,

07:54.274 --> 07:58.819
I'm a gun, Grecia. I'm a gun, Greece, no. I'm a gun, 
this country. I'm a gun, Malaysia. People don't

08:06.346 --> 08:06.886
know. You do something, but you never say. You're 
afraid to say something. But that's what the

08:12.772 --> 08:13.493
communists do. He answered America. He answered 
China. He answered all the countries. He said, oh,

08:22.280 --> 08:29.166
that's good. He said, you know the paper, the paper 
type, you know? This America is paper type. You

08:34.531 --> 08:36.052
understand what he said? The type? The type? Yeah. 
Paper type? Yeah, paper type. Yeah. That was

08:44.472 --> 08:46.715
before Reagan's time. Yeah. Now you think Reagan 
is more supportive. Yeah, about the politics, you

08:51.161 --> 08:55.647
know, about the prestige, you know. More than the 
support, you know. So if America had supported

08:59.012 --> 09:09.967
Cambodia more, you think y'all would still be an 
independent nation without communists? Yeah. Do

09:12.350 --> 09:14.293
you... Can you... estimate how much protection 
that would have been, how much involvement it

09:14.746 --> 09:24.583
would require? You know, I talked at that time, 
when I was pregnant, 19, 17, all of them. I received

09:30.093 --> 09:37.786
the vice president in my capital country. I'm new. 
I tell him, You work too slow and too much, you know.

09:46.320 --> 09:54.895
When you spend $1, $2, and the company,

09:46.320 --> 09:54.895
they spend... Diljana,

09:55.195 --> 10:12.129
Diljana. That's the white girl, Prudhana Nagar. 
And you know, you remember the problem, Chiku

10:12.931 --> 10:14.434
Sorokki, Omani, or something. The problem is that 
the people here are very good. But what did the

10:15.776 --> 10:16.398
communists do? What did the communists do? And why 
all

10:18.888 --> 10:39.706
the people with arms like this in 1967, 1963, 1968, 
do you remember? Which one? Cuba? No. We say, and

10:40.147 --> 10:41.168
why? Because the people, they protest. Then they, 
like, pull up now. They are white, old, good, old.

10:48.082 --> 10:51.726
Airplane, town, all things. And he flies. And 
about a month, he's finished. They go back. They

10:58.012 --> 11:00.655
don't lose time. They don't... They have 
prestige. They don't lose any prestige. My

11:05.299 --> 11:08.342
brother and you, let me know. Oh, you talk like my 
mother. Yeah. No, I... Something too much,

11:19.115 --> 11:30.013
something

11:19.115 --> 11:30.013
extra is not good. Even freedom, too much freedom 
is not good too. Too much speech is not good too. The

11:36.724 --> 11:43.114
best way, we have to do something for the best for 
the people. When you have too much freedom, That is

11:45.592 --> 11:53.385
the

11:45.592 --> 11:53.385
opposite.

11:53.405 --> 11:59.014
You don't have any discipline,

11:53.405 --> 11:59.014
you know? When your family, you fight your father, 
you fight your mother, you don't respect them, you

11:59.816 --> 12:05.765
know? It's good. Oh, you have to adjust that, in my 
opinion. In my country, you know, when I was a

12:07.248 --> 12:11.515
secretary of the country, It's hard for me to

12:11.967 --> 12:31.546
find a market to sell rice, to sell corn, to sell all 
the food. Beautiful. Because we hire a lot, it's a

12:31.787 --> 12:35.210
good plan. But with more than three years of 
employment, we don't have anything to do. Oh, if we

12:38.053 --> 12:39.394
don't know how about the employment, we don't 
understand. You know, this year in China, people

12:40.587 --> 12:55.449
for 50

12:40.587 --> 12:55.449
years,

12:40.587 --> 12:55.449
50 years, by Bapu Dukkha, you know what I mean? 
Because they don't know how to do it, right? You

12:58.053 --> 13:03.020
know, it ran in my home, my family, but it did not run 
here. And you cannot order the people, oh, grow

13:03.121 --> 13:06.506
rai, kumaro, right? They grow in some village, you 
know what I mean? You cannot do that, you know? In

13:08.529 --> 13:09.430
the Bapu Dukkha, it's different, you know? Even 
your country, people from Tennessee, they're

13:10.017 --> 13:20.588
different from Thailand, and from Texas, they're 
different from all the states. And you are, you're

13:20.608 --> 13:32.721
from Thailand, maybe from Myanmar, or from Hong 
Kong, or from Poland, from Asia, little, little.

13:32.741 --> 13:37.206
You are American, but American, but your costume, 
you have to... to deal with your grandmother. It's

13:42.976 --> 13:44.698
true.

13:48.182 --> 13:50.926
Yeah.

13:51.947 --> 14:07.986
How much of advantage do you think the South 
Vietnam

13:51.947 --> 14:07.986
help that they gave to Cambodia, was that a big help 
to y'all? This South Vietnam

14:09.468 --> 14:22.501
military aid that Cambodia received, was that 
very beneficiary? You know, this, I don't know. We

14:26.986 --> 14:32.231
have three steps, you know. First step, we have 
five countries. North Vietnam is called Tocan.

14:38.678 --> 14:41.421
Central Vietnam is called Annam. And South 
Vietnam is called Kuchangshir. And we have

14:46.588 --> 14:52.535
Cambodia and Laos, five countries. You know? And 
the first step, the war, when the French

14:54.077 --> 15:06.733
government loses the war, they make a mistake and 
beat from, not from your country, but from

14:54.077 --> 15:06.733
England. They said, maybe we We let them unify the 
three countries. Maybe he satisfied. He don't

15:15.523 --> 15:17.104
like to be communist. No. And you know, from 1954, 
you know. But now, instead they happy about that,

15:23.189 --> 15:28.894
they don't like the annex. No, they don't like the 
annex. You know, Laos and Cambodia. You know, Laos

15:35.540 --> 15:37.862
and Cambodia, you have a kingdom. You know what I'm 
saying? Because, you know right, the ambition is

15:44.372 --> 15:49.678
going to be big, big, big. Now, you know, Vietnam is 
the service of the war,

15:49.698 --> 15:55.284
of the military. Now, you know, now, because they 
have all arms, you know, built by Christians. left

16:02.665 --> 16:11.814
by you, you know, around the world, from all the 
countries. And I said, in the next step, he would

16:11.834 --> 16:22.324
like to arrive in Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, 
Indonesia. You know, now we can arrive in Thailand

16:22.344 --> 16:25.046
in one day. You know, now we have how many million 
soldiers? I

16:32.213 --> 16:52.872
see

16:32.213 --> 16:52.872
now the most soldiers in

16:32.213 --> 16:52.872
the world, you know, because they are still 
soldiers now. But, you know, all events, you know,

16:52.892 --> 17:00.499
before, you know, the time of Napoleon in France, 
you know, basically he was in coma, but, you know,

16:52.892 --> 17:00.499
he cannot, you know, Confirmation

17:01.002 --> 17:09.137
by the sun, you know, the victory. And now we have 
combat inside between the dirja, inside between

17:09.958 --> 17:19.014
the people, the economy, the public, and the 
Chinese people. And now we stand inside. In

17:21.404 --> 17:42.703
the last year,

17:21.404 --> 17:42.703
we made us a world country. Like Europe, a large 
world country. Like Africa, all small. And

17:51.965 --> 18:17.166
you

17:51.965 --> 18:17.166
know, most of the products they use to build atomic 
bombs, to build something, to buy something,

17:51.965 --> 18:17.166
everything, you know, you come from, from other 
countries, 99% from Africa or other countries.

18:17.186 --> 18:18.208
When they put it all down, and they don't know how, 
Why you have

18:18.610 --> 18:28.379
a red system? Now you have internet again? Of 
course, you focus and take over. What? Not get up,

18:34.024 --> 18:35.366
you know? No, like that. Have to fight, have to 
fight. Me, still, brother, many people I heard,

18:40.010 --> 18:41.671
why, why? People like to send money, why they send 
to place to stay here? What? If they don't know,

18:45.914 --> 18:55.928
it's very dangerous to stay, you know. When you 
have to find your neighbor, you have to help them,

18:55.949 --> 19:03.820
or you prepare to evacuate your home. It's very

19:03.840 --> 19:07.365
dangerous. Hello, can I have you? Good to have you. 
And if you pass me all the questions, you try,

19:17.377 --> 19:22.803
prepare, and if you have time, I can talk. But 
again, for you, it's the best, you know. Yeah. Now,

19:27.547 --> 19:29.610
you come to this. Oh, yes, okay. What line of 
propaganda did the communists use to infiltrate

19:33.417 --> 19:40.035
Cambodia? No. I

19:40.953 --> 20:00.546
know you've

19:40.953 --> 20:00.546
already

19:40.953 --> 20:00.546
discussed a lot.

20:00.566 --> 20:00.667
Yeah. This is the same use and the same propaganda, 
subversion, you know. You know, you are poor, you

20:03.491 --> 20:06.276
are low-potion, you know, and we don't have any 
freedom, we don't have any justice, you know. and

20:06.256 --> 20:11.676
everyone supported, all the rishis, you know, now 
as a whole. How did they get this message across?

20:16.394 --> 20:26.867
Because I was reading that the newspapers in 
Cambodia weren't like the newspapers in America,

20:16.394 --> 20:26.867
where everyone gets one. Oh, no, no.

20:33.135 --> 20:41.005
You know, the

20:33.135 --> 20:41.005
people in Cambodia, we don't have enough 
Newspapers,

20:41.356 --> 20:56.115
you know. You know, the most of the educated 
people, professors, educators, thank you for

20:56.135 --> 20:57.880
saying. So it was

20:58.872 --> 21:25.724
through

20:58.872 --> 21:25.724
the educated

20:58.872 --> 21:25.724
class that propaganda

20:58.872 --> 21:25.724
spread. Yeah. you know, for the first day,

21:28.083 --> 21:56.503
you know, before, a

21:28.083 --> 21:56.503
bit before the

21:28.083 --> 21:56.503
invasion

21:28.083 --> 21:56.503
of Cambodia, most of the students from Chinese 
schools, even the girls, they like to go to the sea,

21:28.083 --> 21:56.503
you know, and all the schools, And

21:57.209 --> 22:15.113
when they come, they talk away for

21:57.209 --> 22:15.113
the first time, they kill, they kill, kill, all, 
all the little people. Yeah, because they go

22:15.133 --> 22:15.734
missing. He said, you have to chant. 
Purification. Yeah, purification. This is the

22:22.463 --> 22:25.427
way, because they believe to us more than some 
others. But you

22:26.133 --> 22:48.978
know, like, I come with my friends to fly for 
Whitehounds and I want to do it here. You know? So,

22:49.198 --> 22:51.921
when someone would like to be a squadron, when they 
like to have some fun, they like to sail, use a gun,

22:49.198 --> 22:51.921
boat and so on, a squadron. Oh,

22:52.593 --> 23:16.421
you know, go to like some

22:52.593 --> 23:16.421
food, you know, some food for them, some 
cigarettes. Go to have dinner or lunch with them.

23:17.202 --> 23:18.103
Go, I'll show you, see if you, you know. Only this, 
you know, through the orientation from why I'm

23:18.123 --> 23:20.125
saying. This will let you eat. together, like

23:22.546 --> 23:45.292
the

23:22.546 --> 23:45.292
communists,

23:22.546 --> 23:45.292
you know. And before you go to work, no, not good. 
Before you go to work, when you get so-and-so, oh, I

23:46.254 --> 23:48.937
do, I do, this is my, this one, the best car, you 
know, cheap, pretty nice car. You have to accept,

23:48.957 --> 23:50.038
you know, and me and my friend, We explain what we 
don't like

23:50.525 --> 24:04.706
to believe, we explain to them, but they're not 
really happy. You don't need to read much in the

24:04.726 --> 24:10.134
newspaper, but you probably don't have that 
practice, and you don't like to believe. Before

24:10.154 --> 24:11.115
the cross. We

24:12.260 --> 24:33.010
don't

24:12.260 --> 24:33.010
have really good

24:12.260 --> 24:33.010
people.

24:33.030 --> 24:37.276
My country is the best because both modern and the 
person that have land, have farm, and have a house,

24:33.030 --> 24:37.276
different from other country, you know? We 
live... Yeah. And we can talk about that on this,

24:37.637 --> 24:38.538
you know? And now they regret, you know? And my 
country is like, you don't have any money. to

24:40.947 --> 24:47.055
travel around the country. And at night, at 
lunchtime, you go to ask to eat, to pray, to pray, to

24:48.737 --> 24:56.467
pray, to read. And then you would like to stay, to 
pray, to night, to read. You can't stay here before

25:00.733 --> 25:01.894
the war. This is a very good country. The

25:03.661 --> 25:25.384
communists, they

25:03.661 --> 25:25.384
were right to be a big country, they were right to 
have a good land, healthy land, you know? Because,

25:25.404 --> 25:27.326
you know, most of the people are communists. And 
so, you know, communists, they are pro, right?

25:29.568 --> 25:31.690
They say for the communists, what to do so? They 
kill themselves. They kill themselves. because

25:33.513 --> 25:39.053
it said that we make a mistake, you know? And now in 
your country. It's

25:40.718 --> 26:01.031
the best thing I've ever spent. The people, most of 
them, like, come back to the museum, so I meet with

26:01.051 --> 26:03.014
them and have a good time. So, thank you for that. 
But the company, the company, you know, thank you.

26:04.536 --> 26:05.358
Oh, God, oh, my people, oh, so beautiful. But, 
uh... Do

26:05.558 --> 26:32.882
you feel that if Cambodia had had a stronger 
communication system where y'all would have been

26:05.558 --> 26:32.882
more personally in contact with the people of 
Cambodia where y'all could have told them that

26:33.436 --> 26:40.604
these were lies that they were receiving, do you 
think it would have prevented them from this? Yes,

26:40.624 --> 26:43.167
yes. I explained to you very well. And before, I 
don't believe. I believe maybe he made a mistake.

26:55.561 --> 26:58.824
He did something not good, but not at all. Now, he's 
separated. from

27:02.731 --> 27:13.232
children, from the wife, from the husband, what to 
do. He said, it is for young people and the world,

27:13.252 --> 27:16.639
but you know, He said

27:17.412 --> 27:34.677
that he had

27:17.412 --> 27:34.677
a

27:17.412 --> 27:34.677
lot of pregnancy with the dear young. And when he 
grew up, you can see what he was thinking. He had a

27:38.843 --> 27:39.384
lot of corruption. And the people don't have 
anything to do with it. But the family of the...

27:41.560 --> 27:48.569
People in high

27:41.560 --> 27:48.569
position, they have too much good things. Not 
this, this, not, oh, not good. And the people now

27:56.219 --> 27:57.902
don't, don't try to do. They don't believe more, 
you know, because they know themselves. In

28:01.844 --> 28:27.941
that sense, you are like someone who, what you 
said, you have a relationship with the world.

28:27.961 --> 28:28.422
You're young, you know. Most of them. Each one of 
them. Okay, um... How much did Senehook's

28:30.413 --> 28:39.365
affiliation with the communists contribute to 
their takeover? Them using, being able to say that

28:43.103 --> 28:55.916
was supporting them and that they were fighting 
for Sinahook's policy. Yeah, I think the power of

28:57.718 --> 29:07.388
the responsibility of the Sinahook for that is 
really big. You know, we were very good. Right.

29:08.129 --> 29:08.650
Inside, outside, you know. When we had war with the 
Nicaraguanas, and the Nicaraguanas, you know,

29:08.670 --> 29:12.013
the Nicaraguan people don't like the 
Nicaraguanas. They don't use

29:12.601 --> 29:20.032
the name of Congress. They use the name

29:20.052 --> 29:31.849
of the Sihanouk and take care of all this stuff. But 
this Sihanouk, he don't know. They use him like

29:33.672 --> 29:38.659
this, rather than he know this Ula and Sihanouk. Do 
you think the communists would have succeeded

29:38.993 --> 29:49.927
with the invasion without Senebuk's

29:38.993 --> 29:49.927
affiliation with them? No, no, no. No. So that was 
the only way communists could get a hold of

29:52.130 --> 29:56.256
Cambodia. The people don't drop the bomb. They 
say, no, we won't be cold. What does it look like?

30:07.715 --> 30:37.418
How

30:07.715 --> 30:37.418
do you, now that communists have taken over 
Cambodia. From reading your article, you

30:43.360 --> 30:48.567
definitely see a free Cambodia in the future. What 
are your goals to achieve a free Cambodia? What

30:55.436 --> 31:01.785
steps?

31:02.592 --> 31:12.088
is one of

31:02.592 --> 31:12.088
the fundraisers of the United States movement. 
And now we have a movement, and we have a

31:12.209 --> 31:23.548
government, a coalition government, and we have 
more and more support. And now, all the countries

31:23.568 --> 31:26.473
in the world help us. to call

31:27.010 --> 31:47.939
to

31:27.010 --> 31:47.939
the

31:27.010 --> 31:47.939
government group

31:27.010 --> 31:47.939
to withdraw as soon as possible from our country. 
And after that, you know, he asked the United

31:47.959 --> 31:56.511
Nations group to tell us, to ask the security to let 
the people join the new regime by election,

31:47.959 --> 31:56.511
re-election under international control.

31:59.984 --> 32:11.436
So if a free Cambodia is established in the future, 
your policy will continue to be one of neutrality?

32:11.796 --> 32:25.530
Yes, because we have to use that name, I think, 
because they are afraid somebody, they don't go

32:11.796 --> 32:25.530
like they say, oh, you are American, you are 
Christian, neutral. They have more support. Will

32:27.490 --> 32:38.166
y'all be able to uphold a policy of neutrality with 
the communists being so close? Yeah. Is that a big

32:38.306 --> 32:41.511
problem, a big threat? Yeah, yeah, but I think the 
first step we have to do is that the political, you

32:41.651 --> 32:52.968
know, yeah, because we cannot use all the 
political difficulties. But when we provide to

32:52.988 --> 32:56.012
Seoul, to the poor, We don't like to be enemy of 
communists, you know, too much, run with the

32:56.448 --> 33:05.143
reward. Will America play a major role in Cambodia 
achieving independence? Yeah. I think now we have

33:15.460 --> 33:20.008
more and more, you know, Ladies and gentlemen, he 
was sitting. He was

33:27.489 --> 33:31.360
dancing. And then we were in Indonesia, and he gave 
support to the company. but I think that we don't

33:36.256 --> 33:43.185
need it. Like Vietnam, to send approval, to send 
something, as you call it, political, as you call

33:43.205 --> 33:56.762
it, to add something to another country, you know? 
I think that we don't need to send approval, to send

33:56.782 --> 34:01.528
something like last fall, last night. Will it be 
more of an internal yeah change yeah because

34:04.623 --> 34:15.527
you

34:04.623 --> 34:15.527
know now If

34:15.946 --> 34:44.248
you tell us to not go there, you know, I don't want to 
be involved directly, you know, because we are a

34:15.946 --> 34:44.248
big country and we see, you know, like, you know, 
the war, you know, nothing, you know, not to be

34:15.946 --> 34:44.248
involved directly, you know, but most of the 
people are in this country, you know, and I just go,

34:15.946 --> 34:44.248
you know. I

34:45.022 --> 35:05.150
think with more Brazil,

34:45.022 --> 35:05.150
now we have a Brazilian economy. All of Vietnam, we 
need more and more of that economy, you know,

35:05.170 --> 35:07.013
because we have a lot of... you

35:08.039 --> 35:37.962
know, you ask Thank

35:38.667 --> 36:00.253
you. who

36:00.892 --> 36:23.520
will

36:00.892 --> 36:23.520
take care of yourself first. But also, you have 
some children who are difficult, you know, for

36:23.540 --> 36:27.125
people, both the country's young people and the 
children now who are difficult to counsel. One

36:27.145 --> 36:29.187
last question. Do you Do you see any similarities 
with Cambodia and America as far as communist

36:30.254 --> 36:42.229
propaganda is concerned?

36:45.013 --> 36:56.488
Since you've been here for a while now, have you 
observed any communist propaganda that you would

36:45.013 --> 36:56.488
consider very dangerous to the American 
government? Yeah. I

36:57.575 --> 37:22.080
heard,

36:57.575 --> 37:22.080
you know, I don't know, from my side, but I heard 
from a few, I don't understand, from a group of

36:57.575 --> 37:22.080
Americans, from South Americans, communists, 
like that, and some on Chinese or Vietnamese or

36:57.575 --> 37:22.080
some of the other people. Why is

37:22.060 --> 37:36.788
that? I don't know. I don't like to say it. But I said 
it. I don't want to say it. I don't want to say it. I

37:38.832 --> 37:39.293
don't want to say it. I don't want to say it. I don't 
want to say it. I don't want to say it. I don't want to

37:40.756 --> 37:41.217
say it. Yeah.

37:52.753 --> 37:53.294
Very dangerous. I

37:53.514 --> 37:59.883
don't do it because, you know, my country is going 
to be communist. But before the communist war,

37:59.903 --> 38:01.505
part of my freedom, I know it's not going to work. 
And when they run, they let them... a

38:02.206 --> 38:26.607
grand list of the territory from Tonkin, North 
Vietnam, to Annam, to Kuchanshin, to Pao, to Nha

38:02.206 --> 38:26.607
Trang, to Nha Trang, to Nha Trang, to Nha Trang, to 
Nha Trang. You know, you said that many people in

38:26.627 --> 38:27.589
Singapore Oh,

38:27.856 --> 38:50.853
we don't like to have God's life. We have nothing to 
give to God. We like to have peace. This is true. But

38:52.255 --> 38:52.716
we don't like this. We don't have peace. Some, 
some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some,

38:53.157 --> 38:55.180
some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some. He

38:55.160 --> 39:17.620
had more and more and more and more. He had this one 
more and more and more. He was a very talented

39:18.441 --> 39:19.041
person. He was a very talented person. He was a very 
talented person. He was a very talented person. He

39:20.983 --> 39:21.583
was a very talented person. He was a very talented 
person. He was a very talented person. He was a very

39:22.844 --> 39:23.445
talented person. In

39:24.472 --> 39:49.990
Cambodia, is again established as a free nation, 
will y'all certainly be more wary of your

39:50.257 --> 40:00.010
communist neighbors?

40:04.035 --> 40:10.844
Will

40:04.035 --> 40:10.844
y'all work harder to protect yourself against 
them? Even though y'all have a policy of

40:10.864 --> 40:19.015
neutrality, will y'all be more...

40:22.268 --> 40:25.313
You know. Alert to the danger. Yeah.

40:32.484 --> 40:48.428
You know, like, after about two, when you have a 
problem, you know, you have a friend, you know, you

40:32.484 --> 40:48.428
have a friend, you have a friend, you have a friend, 
you have a friend, you have a friend, you have a

40:32.484 --> 40:48.428
friend, you have a friend, you have a friend, you 
have a friend, you have a friend, you have a friend,

40:48.408 --> 40:54.685
until

40:48.408 --> 40:54.685
75. He said, So

40:56.002 --> 41:22.802
we have to have a strategy to do something about 
neutrality, to guarantee the protest, and to have

40:56.002 --> 41:22.802
a regional committee, like the 30th, the 31st 
30th, In 1954,

41:22.782 --> 41:52.485
in 1954,

41:22.782 --> 41:52.485
we have great companies, we have Chinese, we have 
Indonesia,

41:22.782 --> 41:52.485
we have Chinese, we have India, we have Poland, we 
have 100, now we have 2 presidents, we have 500,

41:22.782 --> 41:52.485
1000, 1 president, 2 presidents, 1 is the 
communist, Once

41:54.997 --> 42:17.332
India and Burma and some other republics had 
become non-trivial. We need to have a system to

42:17.352 --> 42:18.634
guarantee that we cannot live alone. We take a 
road, a way to survive alone. Thank

42:21.997 --> 42:42.841
you very much. You're welcome. Thank

42:46.533 --> 43:04.130
you

42:46.533 --> 43:04.130
very much. I appreciate this.
