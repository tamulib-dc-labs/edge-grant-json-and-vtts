I just,

00:04.283 --> 00:11.293
I cared, let's see, where was I?

00:16.760 --> 00:18.583
No, it's just very close to me. This place has been a 
part of my family. It is my family, so to speak. And I

00:23.609 --> 00:29.177
care very much what happens to it and I watch things 
as time goes by. I felt like we lost a little bit of

00:29.900 --> 00:39.658
the personal touch during the last maybe five 
years of my tenure. It was slipping away. People

00:42.183 --> 00:46.311
were changing, things were changing, and it just 
wasn't the same. But all in all, I think it's a

00:47.493 --> 00:51.020
university to be proud of. And I wish it well.
