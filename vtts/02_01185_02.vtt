WEBVTT

00:02.815 --> 00:04.597
about killer asteroids and comets? I would beware 
of spending an awful lot of money on killer

00:06.680 --> 00:13.950
asteroid and comet detection. I don't think 
that's appropriate. I think we as a scientific

00:17.034 --> 00:25.105
community should avoid raising the scare. This 
will always happen, however. I mean, look at the

00:28.470 --> 00:31.033
1910 comet. situation, and you've got an 
analogous situation. These things develop of

00:39.866 --> 00:52.787
their own accord, and in these tight funding 
times, it's awfully hard to fault the people who

00:39.866 --> 00:52.787
stand ready to prey on the public's fears. But I 
think as responsible scientists, we can do

00:52.807 --> 00:57.915
something. I would hope that we could keep the 
expenditures on these things to within

00:58.300 --> 01:06.507
reasonable and appropriate limits.

01:09.950 --> 01:19.218
The relationship of the press, or TV, whatever, 
media, with the AS is certainly a lot different

01:09.950 --> 01:19.218
than it was when I was a grad student. I mean, a 
reporter at an AS meeting was a real rarity. Maybe

01:22.180 --> 01:27.885
from the local paper, astronomers meet or 
something, and now there's quite a bit done. It's

01:29.063 --> 01:31.525
really quite a professional operation. Do you 
think that this has really helped get astronomers

01:31.545 --> 01:38.712
more publicity and reach more public? Oh, yes. Oh, 
yes. It certainly has. I mean, you cannot

01:41.835 --> 01:56.269
underestimate the effect that Kathy Sawyer's 
articles on the front page of the Washington Post

01:41.835 --> 01:56.269
or the New York Times coverage on its science 
section and i guess we had a we were on the front page

01:56.553 --> 02:26.256
of the times at our last meeting as well and that's 
got to be very very helpful and and i think it's

01:56.553 --> 02:26.256
helpful in two ways it's helpful because it alerts 
the congress and the public of the fact that

01:56.553 --> 02:26.256
exciting things are going on in science and it's 
it's something worth doing but i think it's also

01:56.553 --> 02:26.256
important for its effect on the field for pointing 
out to the practitioners that it's okay to put your

02:26.506 --> 02:40.948
name in the papers, and you should be doing more of 
it, more to communicate, let's say, with the

02:26.506 --> 02:40.948
public than we currently are doing. We cannot 
disconnect ourselves from the people who are

02:41.750 --> 02:47.919
funding us, and as a science, we've been tending to 
do that. We used to have a little saying, Iceman and

02:48.380 --> 02:54.910
I, and various other people, the planetary game, 
the Mount Wilson Palomar, funded by Carnegie,

02:55.413 --> 02:58.150
Their attitude was the public be damned. Yeah. You 
know, and obviously we can't do that anymore.

03:02.111 --> 03:03.532
Well, they're now taking public money. So they 
have to do this, too. Oh. Okay, we're back here with

03:10.299 --> 03:19.187
Peter Boyce, and talking about some of the 
overlaps with some of the old-timers at Lowell.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.749
Now, there were two Slifers, correct? Yeah. V.M. 
Slifer had already retired from Lowell and was

03:23.170 --> 03:28.575
living downtown, but E.C. V.M., of course, was the 
person who discovered the galactic recession

03:28.555 --> 03:36.484
radial velocities. Which is often mistakenly 
attributed to somebody at Mount Wilson. Yes.

03:42.531 --> 03:46.755
Hubble did organize them, but they were first 
discovered by V.M. Slipher, and he would spend

03:48.017 --> 03:54.865
three nights on the same exposure at the 
telescope. So... He really had to work to get him.

04:00.500 --> 04:01.281
But E.C. was a wonderful character. Tremendous 
memory. When I first met him in 63, 64, 65, he would

04:07.988 --> 04:21.963
come in and he had all the plates, as I said, 
organized in cigar boxes. And if you asked him

04:23.985 --> 04:27.148
for... what Mars looked like in a 1927 opposition. 
He said, oh, yeah, that one we had to go to South

04:31.214 --> 04:34.498
Africa for. And we stored that in a corona box. And 
he'd go and he'd pick out the box and open it up. Sure

04:41.085 --> 04:44.549
enough, it would be the 1927 plates from South 
Africa. And he could pull them out and put them on

04:45.050 --> 04:57.304
the viewer and talk about all the things that 
happened during that year and the growth of the

04:45.050 --> 04:57.304
dark areas and the caps and the way it would uh cloud 
over and so on so uh it was quite different from any

04:57.908 --> 05:27.207
kind of modern library and plate ball and stuff 
when we tried to use these plates and put

04:57.908 --> 05:27.207
densitometers well some of them had densitometer 
spots and we tried to use those for a study of blue

04:57.908 --> 05:27.207
clearing which is times when you could see surface 
features in the blue as well as in the red, and found

05:27.997 --> 05:52.243
that these densitometer spots were really badly 
done, so that the whole thing was really not a very

05:27.997 --> 05:52.243
firm footing from the standpoint of calibrated 
photometric scale that you'd like to have it. But

05:53.064 --> 05:57.649
certainly, EC had a tremendous... library, and 
most of it just all stored in his memory. And he

06:04.064 --> 06:23.147
would go up with a 24-inch, he'd take a plate, he'd 
start the exposure, and it would begin to drift out

06:04.064 --> 06:23.147
a little bit, and instead of turning the knobs, the 
slow-motion knobs, to bring the telescope back

06:04.064 --> 06:23.147
on, he would just kind of lean against it, you know, 
and one would think that he had probably better

06:23.549 --> 06:31.802
ability to get that telescope where he wanted and 
keep it pointed than most modern observers have

06:23.549 --> 06:31.802
today.

06:34.526 --> 06:43.981
Bill Sinton was another interesting character 
and loved gadgets and loved practical jokes too.

06:45.263 --> 06:51.312
Although maybe Larry Frederick was one of the 
great practical jokes of all time. I guess Larry

06:53.013 --> 06:57.397
was the practical joke. Anyway, what happened 
was, I forget the names, but there are two

06:57.417 --> 07:06.985
telescopes on Mars Hill, the 24-inch and the 
21-inch. And I think Larry came out. No, Larry did

07:13.431 --> 07:14.292
it. Larry was observing on the 24-inch. Which is a 
refractor or a reflector? This is the reflector.

07:22.747 --> 07:24.550
not the old telescope.

07:28.898 --> 07:45.548
About 2 or 3 in the morning the Milky Way would rise 
in the east and we had some poor guy come in from the

07:28.898 --> 07:45.548
east coast or maybe even from Europe observing on 
the 21 inch and this milky way would begin to rise in

07:46.287 --> 08:13.662
the east and larry would kind of wander down the 
road and poke his head in the 21 inch telescope

07:46.287 --> 08:13.662
which is a building which had a roll-off roof and 
say well you see over there i'm beginning to get a

07:46.287 --> 08:13.662
little uh problem with my photometry and and i 
think i see a cloud bank coming in from the east and

07:46.287 --> 08:13.662
the guy would look over and he said oh yeah he said 
wow that's that's pretty bright i i guess i'll uh

07:46.287 --> 08:13.662
just Larry said, I think I'm going to close up and go 
home. And the guy said, I'll do that too. And he

08:17.759 --> 08:19.901
closed up the 21-inch and went home. Of course, 
Larry went back and spent the rest of the night

08:20.202 --> 08:23.244
taking data. And he did it for three nights in a row 
until the guy discovered that maybe this is

08:23.745 --> 08:29.170
something else. And he waited a little longer, and 
suddenly it was very clear that this was the Milky

08:29.230 --> 08:34.835
Way that was sending him home to bed. And Bill 
Sinton used to tell that story with the greatest

08:34.875 --> 08:41.681
gusto you can imagine. Or the other one is to... 
position people in the dome so when they look out

08:44.641 --> 09:09.940
the slit they're looking at sculptor in the south 
galactic pole and jesus on a high cloud that's

08:44.641 --> 09:09.940
right that's another good one um any more 
alzheimer's lamp one i didn't overlap with but he

08:44.641 --> 09:09.940
of course was at lowell observatory for a long time 
and he was one of the early people to try to bring uh

08:44.641 --> 09:09.940
quantitative measurements to uh to planetary 
astronomy. And he never got credit, really, for

09:13.546 --> 09:18.611
what he did, because I don't think he published 
enough. He wasn't aggressive enough. And I think

09:20.072 --> 09:31.683
there was probably a major feeling among the West 
Coast astronomers that these upstarts at Lowell

09:20.072 --> 09:31.683
were not as good scientists as other people. 
Lampman really did a lot of pioneering work in

09:33.124 --> 09:36.127
radiometry, did he not? Tremendous amount. But he 
was a nut on instrumentation. When he died, I think

09:40.354 --> 09:50.504
every battery that had ever been bought by Lowell 
Observatory was there with its... I mean, every

09:50.524 --> 10:00.553
month he would go around all the batteries and the 
recorders and so forth and measure the voltage and

09:50.524 --> 10:00.553
keep a record of it in a notebook. And so it would 
start at a volt and a half, say, and then work down

10:00.573 --> 10:04.716
and work down. Finally... the 1.2 volts that 
became useless, not enough juice in it. Well, he

10:10.053 --> 10:13.317
put it on a shelf, but he would still measure it 
every month. Bill Sinton said he saw notebooks of

10:14.238 --> 10:22.528
Lamplins that had battery measurements where the 
voltages were half a volt and a tenth of a volt. You

10:23.189 --> 10:30.338
know, I think eventually the whole thing must 
have, the acid must have eaten through and it

10:23.189 --> 10:30.338
became worthless. But apparently there were just 
rows upon rows of dead batteries. dead light bulbs

10:34.970 --> 10:41.016
were saved also after the filament burned out in 
the hopes that maybe they could be resurrected.

10:43.578 --> 10:44.639
It's a wild thing. My hope at that time was, except 
it would have given Henry a heart attack, was to...

10:45.400 --> 10:52.847
Henry who? Henry Giklis, was to sneak down into the 
vault where the original Pluto discovery plates

10:52.867 --> 11:02.817
were kept and replace them with plain glass and 
stow them somewhere else. So when Henry would

11:10.122 --> 11:19.038
bring a visitor down to show them very carefully 
the original discovery plates of Pluto, he would

11:10.122 --> 11:19.038
find plain glass. But I am absolutely convinced if 
I'd done that and been found out, it would have been

11:19.478 --> 11:25.429
worth my job at Lowell. When you first got there, 
Could you live on the salary? I mean, Flagstaff's a

11:30.868 --> 11:33.731
pretty expensive place, being 166. And did they 
pay you enough so you could actually make a living?

11:37.034 --> 11:38.195
I thought so at the time. They provided me with a 
house and a major salary of $6,500. Did

11:42.680 --> 11:48.686
you pay your own utilities, or did they provide 
those? They provided the utilities. It was all

11:51.769 --> 11:52.589
right. You know, none of us got rich. Some of us got 
rich. The Slifers got rich on the real estate they

11:59.485 --> 12:03.609
had in the town. And Henry got rich on the cotton. 
Cotton? He had a cotton farm down outside of

12:08.033 --> 12:15.500
Phoenix.

12:15.560 --> 12:20.966
But those of us who stuck to the business didn't 
seem to amass a lot of money. Amass a lot of money.

12:24.691 --> 12:27.054
Any more old-timer stories? Hey, what about... I 
can tell you a couple on John Hall. All right. If you

12:30.459 --> 12:31.180
want that. Sure. John was the most avid observer 
that I had almost ever seen. And it was so important

12:37.469 --> 12:47.684
to him to be using the telescope and getting data 
that he would do that in preference to making sure

12:37.469 --> 12:47.684
that his equipment was working right. And he had to 
throw away a whole month's worth of dark-run data

12:47.804 --> 12:54.293
when he discovered that he hadn't calibrated his 
instruments. I thought it was just an example of

12:54.779 --> 13:00.487
priorities gone wrong. But I found him one time 
chasing an object down as it sank in the west. And

13:09.500 --> 13:16.450
the 72-inch telescope, at that time we'd put a 
72-inch mirror in it, had... You had to put it

13:17.290 --> 13:21.857
across the pier, and it was an English mount. And so 
when it was setting in the west, it had to be up above

13:21.977 --> 13:27.606
the axis. And so to get to the back end, the business 
end, you had to really get up high. I found him on a

13:33.014 --> 13:40.986
rickety metal roll-around observing ladder, 
which was not tall enough. He was standing on a gray

13:41.152 --> 13:44.481
box. We had several gray boxes around us to various 
heights to reach the eyepiece. This gray box was

13:51.118 --> 13:57.895
perched on the waist-high observing ladder 
railing so that the railing itself was 10 feet over

13:58.280 --> 14:02.127
the floor. He had this foot and a half high box, and 
he was standing on tiptoes as this object he was

14:02.467 --> 14:13.546
looking was setting down into the pine trees on the 
west. Well, of course, he was doing one of these

14:13.566 --> 14:23.443
Rube Goldberg things one time and fell off it and 
broke his ribs rather badly. I guess one of many

14:24.335 --> 14:28.299
astronomers who've had accidents like that. This 
was before your time, of course, but were there any

14:29.840 --> 14:38.049
rumors circulating around the staff at the time 
about Percival Lowell and his longtime

14:29.840 --> 14:38.049
secretary? Was her name Rixey, somebody or 
something? I lived in the old library, and I spent a

14:40.591 --> 14:51.642
good long time looking for where the supposed 
tunnel from the library to Lowell's house, which

14:40.591 --> 14:51.642
was basically our front yard, had been. I did not 
see any evidence of the tunnel. I'm not sure that,

14:55.507 --> 15:00.675
given the lack of traffic on the hill, that they 
would have needed a tunnel. Yes, there were plenty

15:01.496 --> 15:03.940
of rumors. It is interesting that Lowell got 
married very late in life, and a couple of days

15:04.201 --> 15:13.815
after that happened, his longtime secretary just 
departed and never returned. So that was around,

15:14.875 --> 15:16.918
huh? Yes. Oh, yeah. Actually, some guys from 
Lowell, I think Len, whatchamacallit, and

15:18.880 --> 15:32.499
somebody else gave a paper on that at the 
historical section of the Division for Planetary

15:18.880 --> 15:32.499
Astronomy one time. They couldn't find the tunnel 
either. They went out and probed for it. This was in

15:35.703 --> 15:36.704
the 70s. And couldn't find it. Well, it's very 
interesting because... People at Lowell did a lot

15:42.128 --> 16:05.276
of things, actually, to try to verify the reality 
of the canals, including putting one of those

15:42.128 --> 16:05.276
little Martian globes that are all around the 
observatory way up on the hills in the San

15:42.128 --> 16:05.276
Francisco peaks and looking at them with the 
24-inch to see what they would see. We actually did

16:05.357 --> 16:10.583
suffer a bit from Lowell's you know, canal scheme. 
I think that EC, while not believing in the canals,

16:14.546 --> 16:25.195
believed in the network of straight lines very, 
very, very, very much. When you were there, how did

16:25.976 --> 16:30.820
the townsfolk take to the observatory and the 
astronomers? Well, they really liked it. We had a

16:34.724 --> 16:40.789
couple times had an open house that drew a lot of 
people out to the Anderson Mesa. And that was

16:41.326 --> 16:50.175
really exciting because people would look in, 
they'd see a globular cluster through the

16:41.326 --> 16:50.175
telescope, and they'd just go haywire. And you 
realized all over again what got you into

16:50.696 --> 16:55.641
astronomy in the first place. You start telling 
them how the light's been coming since before the

16:55.861 --> 17:01.947
pyramids were built and so on. The mystery and 
wonder of it, the public brings that back. And

17:07.773 --> 17:09.375
that's a great thing. I was just always well 
received in the town. I actually did a little

17:14.339 --> 17:19.004
weekly show for a little while. Went down to the 
coffee shop, and they had a little coffee shop talk

17:19.064 --> 17:23.549
show. And I'd talk a little bit about what was going 
on at the observatory, and Henry Giklis

17:24.310 --> 17:32.219
absolutely went ballistic when he found out. I did 
it for three or four weeks, and mentioned

17:32.239 --> 17:37.725
something about... what Henry was doing. And 
people around the town didn't know what Henry was

17:39.434 --> 17:46.063
doing, even though it was very, very important, 
just the proper motion survey. And Henry just put

17:46.884 --> 17:57.239
down the law, laid down the law that he was the one 
that was supposed to be the communication with the

17:46.884 --> 17:57.239
town. And other astronomers were not supposed to 
talk about what was going on at Lowell. And it's

18:02.186 --> 18:06.852
just such a defeating, self-defeating Well, 
that's the way astronomers used to behave. Yeah. I

18:11.619 --> 18:14.462
think in general was quite true. And I think, you 
know, that's the kind of thing we talked about

18:14.522 --> 18:17.125
earlier. I think we suffer from it. I know when I was 
a grad student, in fact, even today, people say,

18:19.307 --> 18:23.973
you know, what are you doing? I say, I'm an 
astronomer. And they say, but you don't act like an

18:24.914 --> 18:27.076
astronomer. Oh, I know, I know. I mean, and I think 
it's an image left over from, now certainly if you

18:28.037 --> 18:35.826
go way back, you know, George Aylor and Hale types, 
they weren't shrinking violets. But did you find

18:36.515 --> 18:45.065
when you were in graduate school that the older 
astronomers tended to be very much to themselves

18:36.515 --> 18:45.065
and not too interested in the public? That's 
right. I was both at Harvard and at Michigan. That

18:53.594 --> 18:58.540
was left to one or two people around the 
observatory. And it was definitely not a high

18:58.722 --> 19:02.506
priority item. No, no. But then again, they 
weren't so dependent on public money at the time.

19:10.473 --> 19:19.082
And they just didn't realize the importance of 
keeping the public informed and excited about

19:10.473 --> 19:19.082
science. But anyway, the times at Lowell were very 
interesting. It must have been wonderful with

19:25.188 --> 19:27.430
Harold Johnson there. because he had a real 
screaming fight with a number of people,

19:28.118 --> 19:42.798
including somebody was, one director came in, the 
one before John Hall who lasted just a year. Who was

19:42.818 --> 19:44.260
the director before? I can't remember. Bart Boak? 
No, that was after. After. He lasted only a year,

19:46.824 --> 19:56.337
and he went and he cleaned out everything in the 
attic, and he threw it out the window into a heap on

19:46.824 --> 19:56.337
the ground. And Harold Johnson and the two 
Slifers, and maybe Lamplin was still alive at the

19:57.295 --> 20:11.412
time, they were, as fast as the stuff was being 
thrown onto the pile, they were grabbing it up and

19:57.295 --> 20:11.412
taking it back inside the building. Waste not, 
want not. As a consequence, you know, when I moved

20:14.516 --> 20:21.665
in, I moved into Harold Johnson's old office, and 
there were a lot of stuff still left. But there's a

20:22.085 --> 20:24.248
tremendous amount of historical material and 
interesting instruments and things which were no

20:24.633 --> 20:29.719
longer used. Some of the bailing wax and bailing 
wire and sealing wax contraptions that were

20:30.140 --> 20:43.416
heaved out in this fit of clearing out that I think 
would have been nice to have around. It made a fine

20:43.536 --> 20:47.701
museum for, you know, archaic astronomical 
instruments. I mean, you know, I'm just thinking

20:51.869 --> 20:54.593
These young whippersnappers, they don't know 
what a vacuum tube is. They don't even know what a

20:55.995 --> 20:58.177
1P21 is. And we had a whole, John Hall had a whole 
closet full of them. Okay.

21:08.411 --> 21:09.112
One more point here. I was talking with Peter Boyce 
about the state of planetary astronomy in the 20s

21:09.132 --> 21:20.307
and 30s when not only was it held in low repute by a 
other astronomers, but also results were few and

21:20.523 --> 21:37.283
far between, and probably a lot of that was due to 
the fact that there was an instrumentation

21:20.523 --> 21:37.283
barrier, both as to wavelength and stability for 
photometry and wavelength for detectors for

21:20.523 --> 21:37.283
spectroscopy, and so you were just about to say 
something about that. I was saying it's

21:37.870 --> 21:49.190
absolutely true that the kind of instrumentation 
that you use for stellar photometry, by and large,

21:37.870 --> 21:49.190
is not very useful for planetary astronomy. 
Telescopes, for instance, if you're trying to

21:49.650 --> 21:59.608
track a fast-moving asteroid, are hard to point 
when you're doing photometry on. So people didn't

21:59.628 --> 22:02.713
do photometry on asteroids. The visible light 
photometry doesn't tell you a great deal about the

22:03.065 --> 22:08.471
asteroids. You have to get into the infrared to 
really pick out the different asteroid families.

22:13.257 --> 22:16.220
And the infrared detectors weren't there. And 
they were not very much encouraged. Their use was

22:20.164 --> 22:28.754
not very encouraged in astrophysics, at least in 
my experience. It was quite unusual. to have

22:30.858 --> 22:34.682
somebody like Bill Sinton actually working at two 
microns. And early on, I know when I went to

22:35.202 --> 22:58.907
graduate school at Michigan, we were

22:35.202 --> 22:58.907
concentrated so heavily on the visible and near 
ultraviolet and near infrared, because that's

22:35.202 --> 22:58.907
where all the spectrum lines of interest were in 
the stellar atmospheres at that temperature

22:35.202 --> 22:58.907
range that We just didn't really pay much 
attention to the infrared at all, and yet that's

22:59.258 --> 23:11.375
exactly the kind of area you need to be in when 
you're doing planetary astronomy. High Spinrat

23:11.475 --> 23:18.285
and I used to and still do refer to H-alpha, which of 
course is in the red region of the spectrum, as the

23:11.475 --> 23:18.285
Mount Wilson infrared. Oh, yeah. No, that's it. I 
mean, High's work on water vapor in... the late

23:27.558 --> 23:34.808
type stars was almost pioneering work in those 
days. Very, very important kind of thing to be

23:36.209 --> 23:39.474
done. And it just, a lot of people didn't do that. I 
mean, they were just happy with the information

23:43.038 --> 23:49.867
they were getting, the physics that they knew in 
the visible. And I think that probably had... That

23:52.077 --> 23:58.488
was why planetary astronomers couldn't do 
anything except take pictures and look at them.

23:59.249 --> 24:06.421
There just wasn't the ability to measure small 
parts of the planetary disk photoelectrically.

24:07.062 --> 24:18.220
Well, I remember going at McDonald when the Anobi 
came out while I was on an observing run, and so the

24:07.062 --> 24:18.220
spectrograph was all set up to work in the 
relatively near infrared. So we got some

24:18.436 --> 24:31.960
spectrum, we looked up tables, lists of lines in 
Novi, and they occasionally would get out to

24:18.436 --> 24:31.960
H-alpha, but usually they'd stop before even 
that. I mean, just start out from 30-some hundred

24:32.641 --> 24:40.495
angstroms, they'd go out to 5,500 or 6,000 or 
something, and then just plain stop. You know, in

24:40.728 --> 24:55.967
our day when we went to graduate school, the 
panchromatic plates that went out to the red were

24:40.728 --> 24:55.967
even relatively new and often not the plate of 
choice if you could get away with stopping at 5,000

24:40.728 --> 24:55.967
angstroms. And I think that colored our approach 
to everything for so long that it was almost a

24:56.007 --> 25:06.300
disaster.

25:06.320 --> 25:08.784
Okay, Peter Boyce has one great story. Well, Maybe 
more. What I meant was one hell of a story. Back in

25:14.986 --> 25:25.558
the late 60s, there was this phenomenon of 
brightening of the Jovian satellites upon

25:14.986 --> 25:25.558
reappearance from eclipse. And sometimes it 
would happen and sometimes it wouldn't. And

25:29.263 --> 25:39.355
people, because of the nearby presence of 
Jupiter, and it was a very difficult observation

25:29.263 --> 25:39.355
to make, We did some observations with an area 
scanner, which in fact showed that the satellite

25:40.010 --> 25:50.766
was in fact a lot brighter immediately after it 
came out of eclipse. But again, it didn't always

25:52.289 --> 25:53.971
happen. So anyway, the story is that we were going 
to look at a reappearance with Kent Ford's

25:55.534 --> 26:07.452
infrared image tube, and that went up to one 
micron, basically, on a spectrograph. You

26:10.810 --> 26:13.272
mentioned the name of the satellite. EO, I 
believe. And so we got all together, and Kent Ford

26:14.854 --> 26:36.780
and I got the spectrograph loaded in the back end of 
the truck, and we were on our way out to Anderson

26:14.854 --> 26:36.780
Mesa because where the telescope was located, 
and... had to get up the hill, get the telescope on,

26:37.300 --> 26:53.920
and get ready for this reappearance, which was 
scheduled for about 10 o'clock in the evening,

26:37.300 --> 26:53.920
because we were going to try to get a spectrum 
immediately after it came out from the shadow of

26:37.300 --> 26:53.920
Jupiter. Well, at that point, we had the 
observatory talk the county into repaving the

26:54.781 --> 27:05.333
road to go up to Anderson Mesa. Part of the sealing 
wax and bailing wire approach, you get other

27:07.766 --> 27:14.015
people to do as much of the work as you can. And so 
they agreed to take on the maintenance of the road,

27:14.476 --> 27:19.783
but only if we widened it, or it was widened. So they 
were in the process of widening this road, and

27:20.224 --> 27:34.324
there was a big, fat, dough-belly-type 
construction foreman for the county highway

27:20.224 --> 27:34.324
department And they had just blown 300 yards of the 
old road away. We arrived at the bottom of the hill

27:44.007 --> 27:51.297
and wanted to get up to the top of the mesa and there 
was no other way to get up to the top of the mesa. And

27:52.018 --> 28:01.070
so we were raging up and down trying to explain to 
this guy who couldn't give a hoot, you know, about

27:52.018 --> 28:01.070
why it was so important to get up there. He said, 
can't you take your observations tomorrow night?

28:03.593 --> 28:07.338
We'll have it all bulldozed out and the road 
pioneered back for you by then. No. He said,

28:09.401 --> 28:13.727
tonight we have an eclipse and we tried to explain 
that it's The moon is coming out from behind

28:14.163 --> 28:19.100
Jupiter, and we have to catch it right as it comes 
out. And this only happens once a month or

28:19.120 --> 28:22.733
something like that. And the guy thought some 
more. We've got a hell of a lot of rock there. He

28:28.932 --> 28:31.736
said, I don't know if we can pioneer a road through 
or not. He says, you know, is that your instrument

28:31.756 --> 28:34.780
on the back of the truck? Pointing to the 
spectrograph, which was sitting there. He said,

28:37.704 --> 28:38.745
yeah, that's it. He says, well, why the hell don't 
you just fuck around with it down here? He says, why

28:41.929 --> 28:45.654
do you have to go all the way to the top of the hill? 
And he says, no, we've got to have the telescope. So

28:48.378 --> 28:49.680
he got on. He put overtime on. And they pioneered a 
road up to the top of the hill. We got the telescope

28:53.988 --> 29:03.303
on and fired up and the image tube working and 
everything going 15 minutes before the

28:53.988 --> 29:03.303
appearance. It was absolutely spectacular. And 
of course, the appearance, the spectra did not

29:06.288 --> 29:11.497
show any different changes in it. How did that 
eventually turn out? Was that just an

29:13.420 --> 29:15.704
instrumental artifact? No, it turns out to have 
been the volcanism. Frost, when you lose a little

29:21.072 --> 29:29.085
bit of the heat of the sun, things frosted over and 
the albedo did in fact change. But if you didn't

29:29.105 --> 29:34.555
have fresh volcanic ejecta, then this wouldn't 
happen. So that's the intermittent character. It

29:37.039 --> 29:38.782
was the new sulfur that did it. And of course, we 
couldn't find that in one micron specter. to have

29:42.807 --> 29:46.479
this old guy with his belly hanging over his belt. 
Couldn't you just fuck around with it down here?
