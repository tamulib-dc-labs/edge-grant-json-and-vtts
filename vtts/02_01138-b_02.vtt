WEBVTT

00:06.477 --> 00:16.492
I'm

00:06.477 --> 00:16.492
playing with poker. I know, I'm trying to play.

00:27.047 --> 00:31.253
Okay.

00:33.123 --> 00:34.346
Why? What do y'all think I'm going to do? We know 
what you're doing. I know. Okay, hold

00:40.379 --> 00:45.911
up. Oh, that's me.

00:52.175 --> 01:06.047
And there's

00:52.175 --> 01:06.047
all these old chests, like treasure chests, but 
it's all made of wood and everything. So Vanessa

01:06.067 --> 01:07.450
Johnson there, To be...

01:36.573 --> 01:37.394
That's pretty big. It's got a, I don't know. It 
looks like an old cat house. It looks like. But it

01:43.644 --> 01:46.428
seems like this old bathroom gill that I'm talking 
about. And there is this rope, a noose rope, that it

01:46.449 --> 01:52.057
just, you can just pull it and it'll just, you know, 
flake, you know. And it's hanging over the top of

01:52.438 --> 01:55.383
the hill. That's what you're talking about. Maybe 
like a Heinemann's thing? Yeah. And so anyway,

01:58.848 --> 02:03.818
these people from up in Minnesota came down to 
Austin. It was all written up in paper, and they had

02:03.838 --> 02:07.847
a big seance there. It'd be ghost callers, is what 
they were, or ghost chasers. What are they called?

02:12.336 --> 02:12.857
I don't know. Well, haven't you ever heard of them? 
The people that go around? That's all they do. They

02:16.425 --> 02:19.371
just take the fun out of it. And there were some from 
New York and Minnesota. I mean, all these people

02:22.372 --> 02:24.956
come down, and there were 12 of them. And they 
stayed there, and they got around this old table,

02:24.976 --> 02:28.061
and they had to stay on it. And this one lady was 
supposed to have gotten possessed, you know, and

02:28.322 --> 02:34.512
rose, you know, out and everything. And see, they 
really do this. I don't think it's fake, either,

02:36.696 --> 02:41.284
because there are so many weird things going on 
over here. So we walked into the graveyard that

02:41.304 --> 02:44.970
day, too, and everything. I was scared to death in 
the house. It's just something that makes you feel

02:47.230 --> 02:49.532
weird. I mean, even at daytime, you just go in there 
and you just are scared. I mean, we were with boys

02:53.477 --> 02:55.900
and everything, and those guys were scared. I 
mean, it's okay. Like this one room, when you walk

02:58.023 --> 03:01.727
in, okay, when you first walk in, everything's 
about to be fine. And when you go to this room to the

03:02.048 --> 03:07.334
left, you know, I mean, you just feel so weird when 
you walk in there. It feels like somebody's just

03:07.394 --> 03:13.742
looking at you like this, you know, and you're just 
kind of like... Anyway, I went up to the graveyard,

03:14.920 --> 03:24.009
and this wasn't anything, but you know how to bury 
somebody with a passable thing in their pocket? We

03:24.570 --> 03:27.113
were sitting there, and I was going to poke it. This 
scared me to death. I was going to put the stick down

03:28.954 --> 03:34.280
there, and it seemed to have this rod or a needle 
around it, so I had to lean over it. John Marshall's

03:34.320 --> 03:35.301
grave. Has it been dead a long time or something? 
Yeah, it's 17-something. It's an old graveyard. I

03:40.326 --> 03:44.050
mean, the most recent grave is 1893, I think. And it 
was this little baby that was three years old. And

03:48.004 --> 03:55.828
so I was going to reach over this broad-armed fence 
here, you know, and I was going to put that stick

03:48.004 --> 03:55.828
down there, and I pumped it in there, and it just 
dropped. And I was like, oh! I thought somebody

03:58.272 --> 04:00.355
grabbed it and everything and scared me. And then 
all of a sudden, I guess it's because I leaned on the

04:00.855 --> 04:06.203
fence, but that gate, that one grave is opened up 
like that, you know? And I was like, oh, shit,

04:06.683 --> 04:08.586
y'all. We're going to haul an ass down off that 
hill. But, like, there have been a lot of weird

04:10.388 --> 04:15.235
things that have happened here. How far is that? 
How far is that? Oh, they're back? Okay, when y'all

04:19.100 --> 04:26.068
come home, we'll go down there and see it. But like, 
there's a, they're building a styrofoam house

04:26.088 --> 04:31.495
somewhere around here. Yeah, it looks like a big 
cave. We ought to go home with Jackie.

04:39.024 --> 04:40.326
Oh, wow. But, um, oh, there's a lot of things to do. 
Wow. But like, uh, well we were talking about going

04:46.113 --> 04:57.689
to Redos and stuff,

04:46.113 --> 04:57.689
you know. Yeah, well, I mean, sometimes, really, I 
would go there in the morning just to wait. Yeah.

05:04.740 --> 05:06.422
Well, anyway, uh, well, Rick and them come down 
there too. Yeah, I know. Yeah. And so, uh, I told my

05:06.843 --> 05:08.745
mother about you and everything. And so, I just 
told her that I liked her a lot and that I loved her

05:08.765 --> 05:13.352
and stuff. And so, she was always there. Yeah. I 
said, okay, she's a different story. No, she's

05:16.756 --> 05:17.778
not. I didn't. So, anyway. Tell my mother what you 
said about, I'm going to go in there and

05:21.262 --> 05:24.126
masturbate. No. I really thought I'd let her get 
run over. So, anyway. This man, Mr. Johnson,

05:28.792 --> 05:34.920
Vanessa's daddy, they used to have this really 
friendly thing. He stopped me for a while. He lived

05:36.362 --> 05:37.884
on that monster ranch. There's no house in there. 
It's an old shack, too. It's not that hard to do. And

05:43.031 --> 05:44.132
so... Anyway, Tim had gone out coming home. No way.

05:54.631 --> 05:55.553
Really, y'all. It's 1 o'clock in the afternoon. 1 
o'clock in the afternoon. Yeah.

06:07.147 --> 06:13.855
She never talks to me. Feel my heart. Feel my heart. 
She goes like this. Feel my heart. God, Jim, that's

06:19.723 --> 06:22.626
scarier than I'll ever do. If you weren't going to 
hear it, I wouldn't ever walk up to my face and

06:22.927 --> 06:31.638
scream, because I guarantee

06:22.927 --> 06:31.638
y'all would. I get scared as shit here at 1 o'clock. 
You ought to see me at 12 o'clock. I decided I don't

06:35.682 --> 06:41.551
like the cat poster. It looks scary. So one time I 
was bogey-sitting with a weaver and a black cat. He

06:53.490 --> 06:58.939
watched real life at 2 o'clock and the kids got in 
the bed and that cat just kicked. Here's how

06:59.628 --> 07:01.631
superstitious I am. We were in El Dorado, and Jan 
and I were going home. Where Tim lives, it goes off

07:04.696 --> 07:09.804
this road, and you make a circle and go back out. A 
goddamn black cat ran right across the road. I

07:12.048 --> 07:12.829
turned around. I wouldn't go across with that 
black cat. I turned around. I just slammed him.

07:16.976 --> 07:22.885
You're supposed to turn around and spit over your 
left shoulder three times. But listen, see if it

07:23.827 --> 07:27.031
crosses your path. And see if that wasn't going to 
be my goddamn path. I was driving home, you know, in

07:29.435 --> 07:31.197
my mother's car. And so I just turned, I just landed 
on my brake and just turned around. I went across

07:34.381 --> 07:37.366
the curb and everything. Just turned around and 
went out through the red circle. But like, Tim

07:39.529 --> 07:43.334
Johnson's gone at 2 o'clock. And he was supposed to 
be back by 10 o'clock. Okay, he never did come back,

07:45.899 --> 07:48.804
you know. It's lighter and lighter. And Mr. 
Johnson was sitting under by their pool. And he

07:52.549 --> 07:53.431
would just sit under it. They had this swing, you 
know. And Austin, he saw a dog. And the dog had been

07:56.796 --> 07:58.639
dead for five years. That's what he told us. And 
see, this is so true. He saw a dog? Dog, yeah. And he

08:03.407 --> 08:07.313
goes, yeah, he goes, hey, Ed, old Tim is hurt. And 
Mr. Johnson was just sitting there like this, he

08:08.174 --> 08:10.658
said. And see, this has to be true, I believe, 
because see, Kim twisted his ankle real bad and

08:10.790 --> 08:17.004
couldn't walk. He was out in the woods, and he goes, 
dog? And he goes, yeah. And he goes, what'd you say?

08:24.221 --> 08:25.323
And he goes, Kim's hurt. And he's out there. I don't 
like it either,

08:26.298 --> 08:51.968
but

08:26.298 --> 08:51.968
I

08:26.298 --> 08:51.968
love it. Here, I'll tell you about another thing 
I've heard about. Dottie Miller's daddy died. Her

09:02.021 --> 09:06.388
daddy died, let's see. You were telling us this in 
the speech, weren't you? Yeah. Her daddy died when

09:13.859 --> 09:17.584
she was a sophomore. And they had to come to school. 
They had had a heart attack. And he was getting

09:21.504 --> 09:31.260
ready to come home from

09:21.504 --> 09:31.260
the hospital and everything. And he was getting 
all dressed. And her mother worked. She couldn't

09:33.884 --> 09:34.786
go pick her up. And while he was getting dressed and 
everything, he had another heart attack and died.

09:37.951 --> 09:40.495
So they had to take him to the office and tell her 
everything. She didn't get her prize. She didn't

09:43.740 --> 09:44.922
believe it. Exactly

09:45.307 --> 10:05.444
one year later, on the day that he died, he always 
used to pull his rocking chair up, sit in front of

09:45.307 --> 10:05.444
the TV and watch it. So that night, Dottie had a 
dream. Her daddy came in. And her mom and everybody

10:09.404 --> 10:13.749
was all sitting around in the living room. Her 
daddy had a little trip. They walked in, you know,

10:14.730 --> 10:18.615
and there was her daddy sitting there in his 
rocking chair, watching the TV and everything off

10:14.730 --> 10:18.615
the way. He goes, oh, they let me out on good time and 
everything. And they visited me after everybody

10:21.719 --> 10:25.924
was and everything. And, you know, he was just 
joking around. He said, they let me out on good

10:27.446 --> 10:29.669
time. And he says, well, I've got to get back now, so 
I'll see y'all later. And so, you know, he got a few

10:33.634 --> 10:34.855
laughs. And that next morning, Dottie got up. She 
was in the living room. The rocking chair was cool.

10:39.552 --> 10:40.453
It was the TV. And the TV was on. It was all white. You 
know, it wasn't anything on yet. And she went over

10:43.396 --> 10:44.677
there and sat on the couch. And her mom walked in. 
You saw that? And her mom had the same dream that

10:48.120 --> 10:52.004
night, too. Look at my arms. I know. It gives me the 
back of kids' bones, too. Oh, my eyes are watering.

10:58.049 --> 10:59.991
I don't even need to tell you. What was that other 
girl telling us about? Because it was a girl that

11:01.873 --> 11:04.335
had made a speech about guys. remember

11:04.687 --> 11:31.977
that boy should

11:04.687 --> 11:31.977
have heard some of the stories we heard coming back 
from six days when I was in the bus there was just

11:04.687 --> 11:31.977
about six there was I guess four buses but you know 
on our bus we had the best bus we did we had a good bus

11:04.687 --> 11:31.977
there was about six or seven of us that stayed awake 
and Jeff and I were sitting there real quick, just

11:33.290 --> 11:37.401
going like that. Y'all, I get scared so easily. 
See, that's hard to believe it, that, see what,

11:39.246 --> 11:46.506
they thought they dreamed it, but I didn't really 
get it happening. Y'all ever read one of those

11:46.975 --> 11:57.187
fight magazines? In the Exodus, they say, in the 
Exodus,

11:57.207 --> 12:15.649
they

11:57.207 --> 12:15.649
say,

12:15.629 --> 12:17.611
Anyway, I was going to tell this other story. This 
is Dottie. She's got Dottie's hand in there. And

12:20.996 --> 12:22.418
they brought this house up. See, Dottie's from New 
York. Anyway, they brought this house up to New

12:24.000 --> 12:25.581
York. And it was just kind of this old house, you 
know, and everything. And, like, you think I know.

12:33.692 --> 12:33.812
Okay. Like, you could stand anywhere in this room. 
but like when you got right over by this fireplace

12:36.858 --> 13:02.393
you just breathe the cobalt but you know it would 
never get warm up it's right there by the fireplace

12:36.858 --> 13:02.393
like here's the fireplace in that corner where the 
rocks came out like that and it'd be real cold it was

12:36.858 --> 13:02.393
all rock the whole wall was and so like they were 
going to take like they take pictures and uh there

12:36.858 --> 13:02.393
was a pic it always be a picture of a mix somebody 
hanging behind them just kind of a secret picture

12:36.858 --> 13:02.393
you know Like it'd be the family picture, you know, 
and all of a sudden the body just hanging back there

13:02.373 --> 13:06.618
behind them. And they thought, they got real mad at 
the photographer and they tried to follow suit

13:07.179 --> 13:18.093
with them. And so, um... I'm trying to think what 
happened. Okay. And so, um... Anyway... There was

13:25.677 --> 13:27.179
a fire in the house. Oh, and like, you know, it's 
going to be at night. You know, you can hear

13:29.883 --> 13:31.665
something. It sounded like somebody kind of 
crying. Jeremy, I don't know. And so we're telling

13:37.694 --> 13:39.236
this story. And so like, you know, it sounded like 
you could hear somebody crying, kind of in their

13:39.256 --> 13:43.862
room, just kind of weeping. But, you know, they 
thought it was just the wind and everything. Okay,

13:46.346 --> 13:48.489
the house caught on fire and burnt down. And that 
whole house burnt down except for that one room.

13:52.214 --> 13:52.815
And, um, So they decided

13:53.690 --> 13:58.442
to just... These are true stories that we're 
telling, you know, that we know. And I go, ah! And I

14:04.658 --> 14:08.408
jump down there, and I jump with Jackie. So anyway, 
the whole house burnt down except for that one

14:09.569 --> 14:14.576
room. And that one thing that's left in that room. 
And so anyway, they decided to tear down the rest of

14:17.380 --> 14:22.247
it and just build a new house in that same place. And 
then they knocked down that fireplace. There was a

14:24.310 --> 14:28.977
skeleton whose body, you know, back there had 
been, the rocks had been built around it. The

14:28.997 --> 14:32.102
fireplace had been built around that. Oh, and that 
wall there? Yeah. I've heard some stories. Oh,

14:35.827 --> 14:37.009
what was it called? Green. Dottie's got those 
pictures. Although, that body hanging

14:39.252 --> 14:50.243
behind their family. Isn't that gross? What was he 
kind of father?

14:58.492 --> 15:00.154
You can test it if you like. You can test it if you 
like. It kind of makes you kind of want to... She can

15:09.037 --> 15:30.184
scare

15:09.037 --> 15:30.184
you

15:09.037 --> 15:30.184
like

15:09.037 --> 15:30.184
you would blow. She can feel emotional. That's 
what it was telling us on the way back. It was like,

15:34.799 --> 15:39.815
God, what, oh, God. It was like, what? Well, I'll 
tell you something that happened to my mother,

15:40.576 --> 15:44.382
too. See, like, I can probably tell you this one, 
too, about my uncle who died. My godfather. Well,

15:47.087 --> 15:53.116
see, um, it's my grandfather's best friend, and, 
like, they always used to play around, John. And,

15:53.717 --> 15:56.622
like, oh, his name was, you know, Gordon. Houston. 
Gordon used to call him Chief Tony. Tony was a man

16:00.088 --> 16:01.250
and Chief was a lady. And so, anyway, uh... You 
know, they were getting kind of old and

16:05.281 --> 16:07.505
everything. Like, him and Papa used to play tricks 
on each other all the time. My grandfather, I never

16:10.209 --> 16:13.434
know my grandfather, but this is what I heard. And 
so he always used to play tricks on Mom when she was

16:13.875 --> 16:16.259
little. And on all of his kids, he always did. And so 
he was getting kind of old and everything, and he

16:18.823 --> 16:22.208
wouldn't do it until he was in trouble. And he said, 
I just want to come back to the ranch just one more

16:22.228 --> 16:25.213
time. You know, so he came out to the ranch on a 
Sunday. They drove down to Houston. And he just

16:31.745 --> 16:37.435
walked all over the pasture by himself, you know, 
with the dogs, our dogs and stuff, and everything.

16:37.515 --> 16:39.378
And he went, you know. Your grandfather, your 
godfather? No, his man, my godfather. Yeah, my

16:43.125 --> 16:47.252
grandfather's been dead a long time, about 21, 22 
years. He walked

16:48.599 --> 16:57.769
around the past year saying, you know, he just sat 
around. He brought my brothers all these Spanish

16:57.789 --> 17:03.014
books and everything, how to talk Spanish and all 
this kind of junk. So mama put them up on the

17:03.035 --> 17:06.178
bookshelf in our den. So they left on Wednesday. 
And the next Wednesday, And mom said, and this is

17:14.013 --> 17:17.798
where we even knew it. We were sitting there 
watching TV, wouldn't you know? And we were just

17:20.442 --> 17:23.205
kind of sitting there, and these books were 
leaning this way against the bookshelf. And all of

17:23.606 --> 17:27.011
a sudden, one just fell like this, and another one 
fell like that. And all five of those books fell

17:27.391 --> 17:30.676
over to the other side when they were leaning off 
there. You mean they just fall back that way, they

17:30.996 --> 17:33.499
fell completely to the other side? Yeah, they were 
leaning up against, like here's how the shelf

17:33.519 --> 17:35.302
fell. Like they were leaning to the left, and they 
fell to the right. Yeah, they were leaning, yeah.

17:40.168 --> 17:40.809
That's what they did. And so, anyway... We didn't, 
Mom thought, you know, maybe just wind or

17:42.143 --> 17:48.645
something outside, you know, or, you know, the 
grand me or something. And so... And then she went

17:50.615 --> 17:56.182
up to her room, you know, and all of a sudden, this 
was last year. And all of a sudden, like, her

17:56.202 --> 18:02.791
makeup, she pulled out her makeup drawer, and all 
the things just kind of shuffled around in there.

18:03.151 --> 18:05.775
And she goes, you know, what is this? And all of a 
sudden, the telephone rang, and my grandmother

18:06.516 --> 18:12.643
ended up telling me to die. And, you know, it's 8 
o'clock at night, and this all happened between

18:12.663 --> 18:17.770
8.30 and 10 o'clock. And it's all that stuff that 
you guys have been moving around. And he always

18:24.058 --> 18:29.024
played tricks on Mama. And Mama said that she 
thought that

18:29.044 --> 18:38.276
he was playing one nice trick on her before she 
left. Y'all, Colleen! And I... Hey! Fuck! She

18:41.259 --> 18:43.042
judged my laugh a minute ago. Did you ever see it? 
Tonight at 4 o'clock in Springfield Road, 1, 2, 3,

18:46.268 --> 18:52.220
8, 9. When I come in, I'm going to go, wow. Did you see 
the answers this year? Y'all should have seen it.

18:59.836 --> 19:00.357
Don't you talk about it. No one ever knows about it. 
I wish I could remember some of those names he told

19:03.835 --> 19:07.298
us. Y'all, what was something? Any of y'all seen 
the last house in the lab? No, but I heard that was

19:10.300 --> 19:11.962
gross. Oh, I heard it was so gross when he chased 
that girl out with that knife and just got her at the

19:12.562 --> 19:20.169
asshole and slit her all the way in the back. Sure. 
Because she's naked. And some of them would come

19:21.790 --> 19:23.031
and see the house. And her mother saw that girl's 
necklace on that other girl and got to wondering

19:23.051 --> 19:30.197
what would happen. And so she got that man to go 
outside that was crazy and to kill her. She goes, I

19:33.620 --> 19:37.325
bet you can even do it with your hands tied behind 
your back. And he goes, I can do it anyway. So she

19:39.288 --> 19:40.269
goes, let's see. So she got his tie and tied his 
hands behind his back. So then she started, you

19:45.756 --> 19:49.221
know, giving him blowjobs, oral sex. And so she's 
sitting there. And all of a sudden, she just spits

19:51.805 --> 19:54.388
his dick off. She just goes, ah! And he just goes, 
ah! And everybody started running out there. And

20:00.797 --> 20:01.618
y'all just started seeing you. Did y'all see y'all 
look in the basement? God, that was scary. Did

20:06.507 --> 20:10.071
y'all ever watch that movie that used to come on 
Halloween, Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? No,

20:10.131 --> 20:10.892
I've never heard of it. Oh, where she's dead, 
sitting in the rocking chair at the lab. She used to

20:13.935 --> 20:17.599
be a tap dancer or something. Yeah, yeah. Y'all, 
that was gross. I thought, uh-uh. I can't

20:22.504 --> 20:23.486
remember. I've heard real, it depends on people. I 
saw that. I don't know, when I was a little baby, I

20:26.809 --> 20:31.234
used to go to my grandmother's. And Alfred 
Hitchcock would be on. Y'all, when I'd see him go,

20:34.110 --> 20:40.008
just with his shadow, you know, when he'd walk off, 
I'd get up, or the Twilight Zone. You know, you used

20:41.131 --> 20:44.802
to get scary music at the front. That scary music in 
the front would scare the shit out of me. I couldn't

20:48.102 --> 20:49.024
even watch the movie. I'd go to bed and be scared to 
death. What was the one with the roller coaster?

20:53.030 --> 20:54.793
Oh, I'm trying to think. We used to watch it. It came 
out about Friday night. It was just a carnival.

21:01.925 --> 21:03.347
There wasn't anybody there. What did it do? 
Journey to the Center of the Unknown. Yeah,

21:11.175 --> 21:13.678
Journey to the Unknown. What was it about? Oh, it 
was different. It was scary. I remember one time I

21:17.582 --> 21:24.129
was in that theater and we watched that. I remember 
the Twilight Zone. I remember one of Rod Sterling

21:25.931 --> 21:30.476
and one of something, it was something about this 
mirror. I don't even know who it was. I was really

21:31.938 --> 21:33.840
little and I went to see him. And there was a mirror? 
No. What? I saw myself in the mirror. And New York's

21:42.770 --> 21:45.534
where they saw the New York girls. They saw their 
mother Mary appear in the room. And they thought

21:48.058 --> 21:52.624
that was a, it was just a, what about that big is all 
it was. Because it was in front of the mirror. They

21:53.846 --> 21:54.306
looked. They tried to watch. I don't know. There's 
actually some scary stories that happen around

21:58.812 --> 22:01.736
there. They've got a real old family. You know, it 
goes way back. Well, everybody's family goes way

22:05.722 --> 22:07.925
back. Some people just don't know about their 
family. Like, I don't know. I don't know any of my

22:10.669 --> 22:12.652
relatives. My daddy's got a family. My aunt did. I 
know my great-great-grandmother had ten sets of

22:15.476 --> 22:18.600
twins. That's pretty damn scary, if you ask me. I 
told my parents that they wouldn't believe it.

22:25.550 --> 22:26.071
What? I said... No, she really did have 10 sets of 
twins. What'd they say? Oh, that's not true. And

22:35.214 --> 22:41.522
you know that's the only record of twins we have in 
our family? She had 10 sets of twins. 20 kids? She

22:45.188 --> 22:47.010
had 24 kids. That's way back there.

22:59.047 --> 23:06.658
Saran wrap.

23:07.018 --> 23:11.365
Honey, I'm in heat. You want to have another one? I 
could be just like dogs.

23:18.125 --> 23:20.147
Y'all, how come dogs get pregnant during their 
periods? And people come? It's not really... It's

23:25.914 --> 23:29.439
when there's heat on top of the canyon. Yeah, but 
they bleed. Yeah, I know. It's like a menstrual

23:30.941 --> 23:32.462
period. But I mean, there's dogs that are trying 
to, oh, howling all out loud. They co-coast

23:37.569 --> 23:42.454
their... Oh, howl all the time. Y'all, have you 
ever had one over the holidays? That's what... Oh,

23:46.508 --> 23:47.652
that's funny. Oh, don't you know that hurt? That 
makes my baby feet long. I'll make more

23:50.582 --> 23:54.595
recordings.

26:23.699 --> 26:26.115
Testing one, two, three.

31:49.707 --> 32:14.854
everything

31:49.707 --> 32:14.854
that

31:49.707 --> 32:14.854
i got

31:49.707 --> 32:14.854
is

32:24.672 --> 32:53.869
¶¶

32:57.680 --> 33:06.222
I'm

32:57.680 --> 33:06.222
loving you

33:10.994 --> 33:33.235
Everything

33:10.994 --> 33:33.235
that I've done is just what I've done. I ain't got it 
now. I ain't got it now. I ain't got it now.

33:38.281 --> 33:50.485
And

33:38.281 --> 33:50.485
the rhythm is on me. And the rhythm is where I'm at.

35:21.387 --> 35:25.212
We

35:21.387 --> 35:25.212
hit it right.

35:35.186 --> 35:35.787
Fuck you.

35:41.555 --> 35:41.775
Not really.

35:48.269 --> 36:07.054
I

35:48.269 --> 36:07.054
said,

35:48.269 --> 36:07.054
yeah,

35:48.269 --> 36:07.054
she's not sitting on it now.

36:12.367 --> 36:38.844
Drinking

36:12.367 --> 36:38.844
tea. Drinking tea. Drinking tea. I said Jeffrey 
didn't get back till 2 o'clock. He said this

36:40.366 --> 36:40.787
morning. I said, no, this afternoon. This 
afternoon? He said, where was she? I said, over at

36:45.470 --> 36:47.572
the Wilkinson. I said, what do you think she was? I 
said, nobody in their right mind is going to stick

36:49.754 --> 36:56.962
around their house for that long.

36:57.063 --> 36:59.846
I don't know what I'm going to do this summer. Well, 
I'm not taking this for anybody else. I am,

37:01.628 --> 37:02.488
Jennifer. I am going to go insane. It's a good thing 
I'm working all day.

37:16.475 --> 37:18.500
Jennifer, I've been talking about that tonight.

37:22.311 --> 37:23.273
What'd she say?

37:27.304 --> 37:28.086
What'd you say? I mean, what'd she say?

37:50.410 --> 37:51.491
I think we approached the Tate.

37:54.335 --> 37:57.800
See how much business I can get. And if that worked 
at all, I can't probably go into that. Now, I told

38:00.403 --> 38:07.633
him that probably I would get an apartment now and 
work in the bank now. And Mother goes, she goes,

38:07.653 --> 38:13.100
well, I just heard you planning on having a 
property with us. And I said, well, since Jim was

38:13.121 --> 38:16.485
getting married, I imagine it would be.

39:07.799 --> 39:35.173
I've always

39:07.799 --> 39:35.173
wanted

39:07.799 --> 39:35.173
you,

39:07.799 --> 39:35.173
but never had

39:07.799 --> 39:35.173
you. Thank

39:35.727 --> 39:41.746
you.

39:44.936 --> 39:49.230
Thank

39:44.936 --> 39:49.230
you.

40:03.622 --> 40:28.321
I've

40:03.622 --> 40:28.321
been down the

40:03.622 --> 40:28.321
line,

40:03.622 --> 40:28.321
but there ain't never been a second time. Cause I 
really had my life all together till your eyes were

40:28.341 --> 40:29.663
blind. And there are stories you hear in the 
people's dreams. I've been down the line. Thank

40:31.820 --> 40:54.925
you.

40:58.027 --> 41:17.976
Thank

40:58.027 --> 41:17.976
you.

41:38.088 --> 41:41.396
.

41:41.416 --> 41:54.325
.

53:32.018 --> 53:35.281
I am drunk. And I'm... Let's record now, since I'm 
drunk. What can we say? It's a cop! Look, look,

53:44.410 --> 53:47.093
look! See the poppin' light? Not poppin', but... 
Hey! Fuck you, cop! You're in a car. Chop steak.

53:59.765 --> 54:01.367
That's soybean shit.

54:05.566 --> 54:10.091
Oh, baby, I love you, baby. Y'all, come on, I ain't 
drunk. Let's go party. I'm in a good mood. I'm in a

54:13.275 --> 54:13.956
good mood. Come on, that's okay. We'll cut him. 
We'll cut him. I'll cut him. Shit, I'll cut him on

54:18.181 --> 54:19.462
the first day. I'll cut him every day. But I've 
got... Hell, I'll fuck you out. I don't give a fuck.

54:22.946 --> 54:24.108
I don't give a flying fuck. That's a new saying, 
flying fuck. I've got sociology and English

54:27.672 --> 54:30.015
tomorrow. I've got English and P.E. Oh, baby,

54:33.022 --> 54:38.508
oh, baby. Does this sound recorded in the car?

54:44.934 --> 54:46.316
I'm not wasting it. Hell, I'm wasting it. Oh, hell, 
I'm glad I saw your daddy. I had a friend meet me now.

54:52.963 --> 54:55.325
I didn't make him move out. Beef and bun. I'd rather 
have bun. Oh, man. Let's stop by Weiner's and get

55:01.102 --> 55:06.589
you to pick up the rest.

55:06.790 --> 55:09.222
That wasn't very funny. This makes

55:11.834 --> 55:26.465
me feel

55:11.834 --> 55:26.465
good. I'm hungry as shit. I'm not hungry. I just 
wanna go and have a good time. You're

55:32.506 --> 55:42.781
swallowing yourself. I ain't gonna swallow my own 
tongue. I'm epileptic. Can you imagine somebody

55:49.371 --> 55:59.186
rolled

55:49.371 --> 55:59.186
over side of

55:49.371 --> 55:59.186
you? Oh, my God. Yeah, this makes me feel real 
dizzy. I feel like I'm going to throw up. Jane.

56:01.209 --> 56:01.990
You're almost not even up now, are you? Hey,

56:03.556 --> 56:09.346
y'all, let's go get a winter snitchel. Let's go 
back. I don't want to go upstairs and get Sherry's

56:10.928 --> 56:14.054
ID. OK, let's go get Sherry's ID first. Fuck, man, I 
don't want to get the ID. I will not. Y'all, let's go

56:23.369 --> 56:26.695
to Blue Diamond Town to open that. Hell, I'll sing 
for y'all. You're a cheatin' whore. We'll tell on

56:34.524 --> 56:38.588
you. You're a cheatin' whore. Here, man, gas it, 
baby. Here. We can go cough. We can pass them all.

56:49.079 --> 56:55.045
Turn,

56:49.079 --> 56:55.045
turn, Kay. Turn. Woo!

56:58.670 --> 57:02.634
Hey, turn off your goddamn heater. I'm about to 
have a kissy fit. Instant orgasm. I'm hot, baby.

57:10.764 --> 57:16.090
Let's go to a milkshake at a corn dog. Let me tell 
him. Hey, I want to tell him. I'll tell him. I'll

57:20.935 --> 57:21.536
tell him. I'll tell him. I'll tell him. I'll tell 
him. I'll tell him. She wants a milkshake at a

57:25.100 --> 57:27.883
goddamn corn dog. I want three corn dogs and a large 
order of french fries and a... Are you hungry? Yes,

57:33.720 --> 57:34.481
I'm hungry. Order a dick. Do y'all have things in 
your weenies? And a medium Dr. Pepper.

57:45.194 --> 57:52.102
And a good-looking guy

57:45.194 --> 57:52.102
with a big dick. I'm sure it came undone again. It's 
stinking. Hey, I'm going to light me up. Just give

57:56.395 --> 58:00.659
me the money for yours, and I'll pay for it. I'll 
give you some change. Hey, y'all, this is about to

58:01.220 --> 58:02.241
run out. I hate to tell you so, but it is. Thank you.

58:10.649 --> 58:11.069
Thank you. Where's the guy?

58:17.575 --> 58:21.940
Is he in

58:17.575 --> 58:21.940
the sack? Shut up. Thank you. OK. Come back again 
when you're honey. What do y'all mean, cutting out

58:29.909 --> 58:31.511
the lights in our face?

58:34.676 --> 58:35.697
Hey, we're the last customers tonight. What a 
privilege. Hey, take it out of here. I think I'm

58:38.781 --> 58:42.266
feeling rather perturbed.

58:44.328 --> 58:45.750
Lee, what are they making? Oh,

58:46.111 --> 58:54.081
I just burnt my knee off.

58:57.082 --> 58:58.003
Did we get the sack? Huh? Hey, we didn't get our 
other

59:00.606 --> 59:09.155
stuff yet. Oh, OK. OK. Tell her I want a straw. 
She'll eat it all. That's OK. Tell her I want a

59:11.517 --> 59:16.703
straw, damn it. Can we have a straw, please? Her 
gladiola towel roller? She wants to clean herself

59:19.826 --> 59:22.529
out. Thank you. I didn't think we were all drunk. 
Hell, nobody's drunk. I got short fingernails. I

59:27.971 --> 59:28.733
wonder why I bought them. Let's go to Pizza Inn and 
order some large pizza and throw up. Special. Long

59:35.723 --> 59:36.765
John Silver's. I bet he's got a Long John Silver. A 
Long Silver John. A Long John, baby.

59:49.884 --> 59:50.405
Drop something. Y'all, next time I see this car 
coming, they're going to... They're just like,

59:55.418 --> 59:57.161
close the windows, baby. I

59:57.181 --> 01:00:01.188
think I've got cancer. That girl's looking at me 
like she's pissed off. I wonder why.

01:00:12.629 --> 01:00:14.693
I'm having a marvelous time tonight.

01:00:24.123 --> 01:00:30.977
Just thinking about it makes you hungry.
