00:06.443 --> 00:13.313
Back around 1840 or so, it was common knowledge 
that all stars had planets around them. And then

00:13.333 --> 00:19.401
the Chamberlain-Morton Theories came along, and 
then we were a cosmic freak. The solar system was

00:19.441 --> 00:25.650
the only solar system in the observable universe. 
came along and rehabilitated the nebular

00:25.670 --> 00:31.759
hypothesis. got to be in the space age, you know, 
the idea that solar systems are common. And, of

00:38.161 --> 00:49.159
course,

00:38.161 --> 00:49.159
the literature is littered with claims of 
detecting planets around other stars that don't

00:38.161 --> 00:49.159
hang up. What's your opinion? Are solar systems, 
in the sense of ours, not just as they're a rock

00:49.961 --> 00:59.316
floating around some of the stars, common or 
uncommon?

00:59.887 --> 01:03.031
Yeah, you're right. Every time somebody 
discovers a planet around a

01:03.051 --> 01:11.622
neighboring star, they don't usually pan out. 
Well, in the sense that there are almost certainly

01:11.642 --> 01:21.935
other planets around

01:11.642 --> 01:21.935
other stars, I don't think there's a question to 
that. Life is more than any other planet. This is

01:22.676 --> 01:23.177
another question. Is that the question you're 
asking? Here's going to be the next one. Again, if

01:27.010 --> 01:35.665
you go back to 1840 or 1870,

01:27.010 --> 01:35.665
every planet's inhabited. Then you get to the 
early part of this century with H.G. Wells, who was

01:39.813 --> 01:43.539
very negative about it. We were a cosmic freak. 
Well, now lately people have been searching for

01:46.006 --> 01:54.302
extraterrestrial intelligence by radio means 
and so forth. But lately it seems to me that it's

01:54.322 --> 02:00.193
getting back to the cosmic freak again. What's 
your opinion? No, I quite agree. I think that's the

02:02.277 --> 02:06.506
trend that we're moving toward. You're right, 
about 10 years ago, planets were ubiquitous

02:11.707 --> 02:19.979
around most stars, and a certain percentage of 
those, well, you could work it out with Drake's

02:11.707 --> 02:19.979
equation there. It made all kinds of sense. If you 
put in the numbers, there was a certain percentage

02:22.442 --> 02:27.629
of those planets that were inhabited. Well, where 
are they? They're not making a concerted effort to

02:31.114 --> 02:40.768
get in touch with us, so now you have to start asking 
yourself, well, maybe they're not there. Yeah, I

02:41.035 --> 02:42.277
think that's right. I think there is a realization 
that if we're not alone, we don't have too many

02:42.397 --> 02:51.389
neighbors. And again, we better make sure that we 
don't screw up the one civilization that we have to

02:51.409 --> 03:01.903
deal with at the moment. So yeah, I think that's 
another emerging view is that we're not nearly as

03:01.923 --> 03:08.933
plentiful as we once thought. There's been some 
attention lately given to the fact that some

03:09.942 --> 03:20.892
asteroids are apparently dead comets, but of 
course the first two asteroids that were

03:09.942 --> 03:20.892
photographed turned out to be solid, hard rocks. 
How common do you think it is for a comet to turn into

03:22.334 --> 03:30.321
an asteroid, or do you think in general they just 
sort of evaporate? Well, I think they do both,

03:31.623 --> 03:32.864
actually. I think some comets, once they lost 
their volatile contents, certainly turned into

03:37.904 --> 03:43.929
asteroids, at least temporarily. I think this 
comet, Shoemaker-Levy 9, that's about to collide

03:45.411 --> 04:02.285
with Jupiter next July is probably, my guess would 
be a degassed comet, a very fragile structure that

03:45.411 --> 04:02.285
was torn apart by the tidal forces of Jupiter in 
July of 92. The line between comets and asteroids

04:02.846 --> 04:06.449
is no longer clearly drawn. It's very fuzzy. Comet 
Wilson-Harrington was seen in 1949. It was

04:13.389 --> 04:17.114
rediscovered in 1979, VA, an asteroid. So it was 
once active. It is no longer. So there's one

04:21.180 --> 04:26.668
example of a dead comet, if you will. Perhaps it's 
only dormant. These things could crust over. And

04:30.653 --> 04:37.763
then at some later time, they might blow off a 
portion of the crust and become active again when

04:30.653 --> 04:37.763
the interior ices are exposed. I think a fair 
fraction of the near-Earth asteroids were once

04:39.008 --> 04:42.614
comets. Dynamically, it's much easier to explain 
the population if you have some comets coming in

04:43.095 --> 04:50.608
that way. The estimates of the number of 
perihelion passes that a comet can make before

04:50.628 --> 04:59.023
something happens to it have varied all over the 
lot. What do you think the situation is now?

05:04.979 --> 05:12.696
Recently, fairly recently, the last couple of 
years, there's been a realization that comets can

05:04.979 --> 05:12.696
have periods where they're dormant. They're 
active. They're dormant. They crust over, turn

05:16.444 --> 05:20.693
into or lose their bottles entirely. So the 
estimates that we were seeing five or ten years ago

05:21.128 --> 05:36.415
whereby comets only last 500 or 1,000 returns to 
the sun, I think those estimates have to be revised

05:21.128 --> 05:36.415
up dramatically. Comets like Encke have 
obviously been in its current orbit for millennia

05:36.435 --> 05:43.407
because The Tauric meteor showers have been 
observed for millennia, although the comet

05:43.876 --> 05:53.887
itself wasn't observed until the late 1700s. 
Barring differences due to the fact that some

05:53.907 --> 06:13.309
comets have longer periods than others and so see 
the sun more frequently or less frequently, do you

05:53.907 --> 06:13.309
think the structure of the nucleus of all comets is 
basically similar?

06:16.478 --> 06:19.062
Certainly they're chemically similar. For the 
spectroscopic work that's been done on periodic

06:20.525 --> 06:36.550
comets and long period comets, there are many 
differences between them, but there's no, you

06:20.525 --> 06:36.550
can't put the long period comets in one box and the 
short period comets in another and say these are

06:20.525 --> 06:36.550
chemically distinct from one another. They just 
aren't. There's some short period comets that are

06:38.694 --> 06:43.802
peculiar and some long period comets that are also 
peculiar. But within some broad range, they're

06:44.457 --> 06:57.273
pretty much chemically the same animals, which 
suggests that they were all formed at the same time

06:44.457 --> 06:57.273
and probably at the same place. 
Non-gravitational effects on cometary orbits is

06:57.733 --> 07:04.261
one of your specialties. And part of that includes 
rotation of comet nuclei. Have you folks come up

07:09.968 --> 07:12.511
with anything? I mean, there's a random thing. I 
mean, any correlation with period or anything.

07:19.030 --> 07:28.244
Well, you can observe some active comments and 
note the jet structures coming out from the

07:19.030 --> 07:28.244
nucleus. And from the shape of those jet 
structures, you can infer a rotation, certainly.

07:36.652 --> 07:44.087
But you can't do the traditional photometric 
light curve analysis that you can on asteroids to

07:36.652 --> 07:44.087
get a rotation period. The only thing you can 
really say with regard to comets, there are very

07:44.127 --> 07:54.768
few comets that have a reasonable rotation period 
determined. I think there's only a half dozen or

07:54.788 --> 07:56.812
so. They all seem to be a little longer than... 
Asteroids of a comfortable

07:59.298 --> 08:08.427
size, I'm not sure what that means. Perhaps 
they've been defunded by these same outgassing

08:08.447 --> 08:09.989
forces, I don't know. But again, there's only a 
half dozen or so comets for which a reasonable

08:10.009 --> 08:17.957
rotation period has been determined. And even 
those have large errors. So it's still, I think,

08:21.360 --> 08:24.023
too early to say much about that. Going back into 
the 19th century when the standard way of

08:24.475 --> 08:52.508
observing comets was to look through the 
telescope and eye magnification and draw the

08:24.475 --> 08:52.508
nucleus, with hindsight now you can look at some of 
the great comets of the last century and you can see

08:24.475 --> 08:52.508
the jets coming out from the hot spots and you can 
see the comet rotating as the jet swings around

08:24.475 --> 08:52.508
like a water hose. Didn't people put two and two 
together back then, do you think? Well, Bessel

08:57.232 --> 09:01.997
actually did put two and two together, but he was 
the exception. He, back in, well, back in 1835,

09:02.017 --> 09:21.617
he actually proposed that there was some 
outgassing activity that was preferentially

09:02.017 --> 09:21.617
toward the sun. and

09:22.087 --> 09:35.860
he made the example that if this outgassing 
occurred preferentially toward the Sun and

09:22.087 --> 09:35.860
preferentially before perihelion as opposed to 
after perihelion, you would get a uh decreased in

09:36.532 --> 09:59.265
the commons period

09:36.532 --> 09:59.265
and likewise if the outgassing took place after 
perihelion preferentially you would get an

09:36.532 --> 09:59.265
increase in the commons period he didn't 
attribute this to outgassing in the sense that

09:36.532 --> 09:59.265
this is ice that was vaporizing but he came very 
close to whipple's uh 1950 model, even so. And his

10:02.801 --> 10:13.971
idea for the non-gravs was actually more accurate 
than Fred's mechanism was for the

10:02.801 --> 10:13.971
non-gravitational effects. But, again, it's a 
connection, I think, with the meteor showers and

10:14.471 --> 10:22.499
comets. The meteors were obviously due to 
particles hitting the Earth's atmosphere And so

10:29.452 --> 10:34.497
the inference was that comets were a collection of 
particles, a flying sandbank. And I think that was

10:35.197 --> 10:54.615
the notion that was so ingrained and so obvious to 
most astronomers that these jets that you refer

10:35.197 --> 10:54.615
to, they made up ad hoc suggestions as to how to 
explain those. There's another one on a similar

10:54.635 --> 10:57.197
line. Well, Newton's laws of motion have been 
known for a long time, and action equals reaction

10:58.510 --> 11:08.182
have been known for a long time, and rockets have 
been around for a millennium. And yet, as you

11:09.364 --> 11:22.881
mentioned earlier, the explanation of the 
non-gravitational effects, in particular on

11:09.364 --> 11:22.881
Encke, the first example, as due to a resisting 
medium, a mysterious medium of some sort, hung

11:23.283 --> 11:24.665
around for a long time. When did that—when and who 
first thought that this could be—that the rocket

11:24.845 --> 11:32.614
effect, if you will, could be the explanation? 
Well,

11:33.435 --> 11:48.092
Encke, of course, as you noted, postulated that 
there was some sort of an ether surrounding the—in

11:33.435 --> 11:48.092
the inner solar system, and Encke, in its the 
prograde orbit around the sun was being slowed by

11:48.916 --> 11:53.022
this resisting medium. It's unfortunate that the 
non-gravitational effects on Encke were in the

11:53.122 --> 12:03.938
sense that they were, in the sense that the period 
of Encke is decreasing. Now, if they were

12:03.958 --> 12:09.186
increasing, and they are for many comments, he 
never would have been able to propose that.

12:09.402 --> 12:13.168
particular mechanism, but it was just bad luck, I 
guess. And this ether had been around for

12:13.348 --> 12:18.435
centuries, of course. It started with the Greeks, 
gravitation. So it was something that he brought

12:24.204 --> 12:31.435
back to explain these non-gravitational 
effects. And the notion lingered for several

12:31.455 --> 12:36.021
decades thereafter. But again, the first one who 
pointed out a contrary view that these might be

12:39.642 --> 12:45.530
reactive forces acting on the comet's nucleus 
with vessels. But his views did not carry the day

12:45.630 --> 13:03.195
because

12:45.630 --> 13:03.195
Encke's hypothesis, he could predict quite 
accurately the returns of his comet using his

12:45.630 --> 13:03.195
erroneous theory. His model of the 
interplanetary ether And the drag effects on his

13:07.840 --> 13:20.095
comet did indeed explain the decreasing period of 
his comet and allowed him to make very accurate

13:07.840 --> 13:20.095
predictions of when the comet would next appear at 
perihelion. And so the fact that he was

13:20.115 --> 13:31.869
successfully predicting the comet's increasing 
period added considerable weight to what turned

13:20.115 --> 13:31.869
out to be an erroneous hypothesis. One last 
question and then I'll let you go. The sun graces

13:36.359 --> 13:41.905
all apparently belong to the same family and have a 
common parent. Must have been an enormous body.

13:44.508 --> 13:45.889
And of course, we haven't seen them all. How can you 
score? I mean, we're getting, if you add them all

13:49.053 --> 13:53.978
up, and goodness knows how many there are. Now 
we're starting to get a fairly large body.

13:57.802 --> 13:58.643
Certainly no Jupiter. But how could that be? Well, 
comets' parent bodies can be as large as, well,

14:04.186 --> 14:12.633
some might say Pluto is a very large comet. Chiron 
may be a very large comet.

14:17.298 --> 14:20.300
There's no real upper limit on the size of these 
things. The progenitor for the sun-grating comet

14:21.762 --> 14:30.509
is thought to be the comet of 1106, perhaps 240 BC as 
well. No, I'm sorry, that's Halley. There's

14:32.071 --> 14:33.552
another one back there, though, I forgot in the 
year that the Greeks actually noted the split. But

14:40.221 --> 14:51.193
I think the comet of 1106 is thought by Brian to be 
the progenitor of many of the sun creatures, not

14:40.221 --> 14:51.193
all of them. But that mechanism whereby a large 
parent comet breaking up into many smaller comets

14:51.713 --> 15:02.965
may well explain the preponderance of short 
period comets that we see now. There are too many,

15:03.687 --> 15:07.033
far too many of them. There are too many 
short-period comets for current theories to deal

15:07.053 --> 15:10.919
with. So that splitting of major comets in the 
past, either spontaneous splitting or splitting

15:11.360 --> 15:28.108
because of tidal stresses like Shoemaker-Levy 9, 
may indeed not provide the answer for why there are

15:11.360 --> 15:28.108
so many short-period comets.
