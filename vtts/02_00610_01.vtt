WEBVTT

00:02.309 --> 00:06.796
Y'all must have all been kinfolks in those days. 
Right. You must all have been seen to have been...

00:06.956 --> 00:10.421
White people? No, they was white people. Oh, white 
people? Oh, poor white persons. I know, I go out

00:15.229 --> 00:18.934
this place and I heard he was born. Oh, I didn't know 
he was white, ma'am. Yes, you were. That's because

00:22.820 --> 00:24.222
you didn't like him. Because our boys was well 
learned, and they'd have to speak in his own... at

00:24.863 --> 00:31.253
the schoolhouse, you know, for... White folks 
would wander around for office or something.

00:36.074 --> 00:46.489
Quit,

00:36.074 --> 00:46.489
Howie. Did you raise many, uh, did the white folks, 
the poor white trash and the colored folks have

00:47.511 --> 00:57.726
many fights back in the, after the good break up? 
How many run in? No, we never had nothing to run

00:59.330 --> 01:01.932
into. The dragons. Well, I mean, did they have 
many, you know, quarrels and fights, isn't there?

01:11.061 --> 01:11.241
No. No, they didn't have these white, these buyers 
that had killed our white, our boys, my husband and

01:11.261 --> 01:17.707
his brother. It was poor white people. They didn't 
like it. And let me see how that did come up. I just

01:23.792 --> 01:26.074
forgot that I knew all about that. I know my husband 
was on his way from there. Well, did the white folks

01:29.603 --> 01:33.768
meddle? Did the poor white track meddle much with 
the colored barrels in those days? Not all that at

01:38.534 --> 01:41.277
all. I don't know where they did it. Well, I didn't 
mean at your home. I mean around those. Did you hear

01:45.562 --> 01:50.288
anything like that going on in those days? No. Yes. 
We should let them buy this.

01:57.256 --> 01:58.277
Meddle this too. Well, the girls, we didn't run. 
They had different classes, you know. Color

02:04.576 --> 02:09.024
girls, white boys, white boys, white boys at 
night. We didn't associate. Well, did much of that

02:10.486 --> 02:12.950
go on in those days? Very little of it. It's going on 
more now than it did in my raising of days. Is that

02:18.560 --> 02:19.421
right? Yes, sir. Well, I think this might have gone 
on. Very, very, very. We didn't go, you know. We

02:26.579 --> 02:28.701
didn't associate with that kind, no. It's going on 
more now than it did in my reign. My sister did.

02:34.226 --> 02:37.389
Yeah, you know that little John Junior across the 
street from you? He's got almost blonde hair. Yes.

02:40.532 --> 02:41.653
His hair's white. Mm-hmm, his mama. Yes, his mama, 
Miss Fanny, is his grandma. Mm-hmm. Miss Fanny's

02:48.680 --> 02:54.506
son, Pete Morris, is his father, her oldest son. 
Well, her name was Bell, though. I don't think her

02:59.031 --> 03:00.893
name was his. Her name was Fanny Bell. She married a 
Bell, but Bell wasn't Lee's children's father.

03:08.461 --> 03:09.182
Oh, I see. Morris was Lee's children's father. 
Well, now, who was your second husband, ain't I?

03:15.208 --> 03:17.691
Who was my second husband? Let me see, who was my 
second husband? You married again after, uh, uh,

03:22.235 --> 03:26.800
your, uh, what was his name? Old man. Old man, uh, 
oh, I married Goldson Sawd was my second husband.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.068
Goldson Sawd? Yes. And, uh... How long did you live 
with him? Oh, about a year or two years. He had a

03:40.934 --> 03:44.838
good, he had an engine blood in him. He did? Mm-hmm. 
And my next servant was old man. Well, now what

03:50.344 --> 03:52.627
happened to Bolton Sauls? He died or did you 
divorce him? He didn't sign the divorce, but I got

03:57.815 --> 04:00.939
my divorce from him. That's the thing. You did? 
Yeah. He lived a long time after me and him married.

04:13.004 --> 04:16.868
Well, after you separated from him, who did you 
marry? Old man Purcell. What's his name? Old man

04:19.831 --> 04:22.093
Purcell. How old was he? Oh, he was 80, brother. He 
was older than I was. His wife. That was his second

04:30.982 --> 04:35.967
wife that he married. Well, didn't y'all have 
trouble? Didn't he have a little trouble? Who? You

04:40.212 --> 04:41.593
and old man Purcell. Didn't he kind of cut up and 
carry on? Yes. He cut up and carry on. I quit him.

04:49.178 --> 04:50.119
Come on back home. Did Daddy get you out of the boat? 
Mm-hmm. I heard him. What was the matter with him?

05:00.230 --> 05:01.731
Well, the old man Puster was all right. He was 
right. But his son, that's why we had trouble with

05:02.272 --> 05:06.035
Arthur. He comes to command the place, you know, 
tries to put me on the place. He couldn't do it. I

05:11.577 --> 05:15.321
stayed there as long as I wanted, and I got ready to 
come on home. And then who did you marry? Let me see,

05:19.445 --> 05:21.527
who was the last man I married? Old Man Coker, over 
here. Old Man Coker. Well, didn't he try to whip you

05:25.812 --> 05:28.615
one time? Yes, he could whip me. Speak a little 
louder in here. No, he couldn't whip me. He tried,

05:34.881 --> 05:36.323
but he couldn't. And what did you do to him? Put him 
out of the door. He did? Well, he was about 100 years

05:42.104 --> 05:45.028
old, wasn't he, at some time? I don't know how old he 
was. He was in the Army. In the Civil War. He fought

05:51.236 --> 05:52.297
in the Army. Yes, he fought in the Civil War. And you 
married him in 1930s, didn't you? Yeah. See, that

05:59.346 --> 06:03.231
would make him close to 100 anyhow. Yes, but you 
see, you know, there's other parties between him,

06:03.251 --> 06:10.561
me and him, that's a cause of our trouble. Is that 
right? Yeah. Is this Ethel over here? Was he

06:15.612 --> 06:17.915
chasing girls over here? Yes. He was? Yes. He 
didn't just hobble around? He didn't just hobble

06:22.061 --> 06:23.022
around. He was chasing for his money, you know. Oh, 
I see. See, he got his money from the army. One of the

06:32.535 --> 06:37.542
girls... Must have made a fool out of him. Yes, he 
did. He got his money, all his money. He got $60 or

06:43.994 --> 06:48.559
$70 a month, every month.

06:49.059 --> 06:51.662
Well, do you still go to church here, Harry? Yes, I 
go to church all the time, Harry. I went to the

06:54.606 --> 06:56.868
Methodist church up there. Oh, yeah. At St. 
Annie's. At St. Annie's. Yes, I joined that church

06:59.471 --> 07:02.074
after I come here. We built that church. Who's your 
preacher up there? I have never met him. We've got a

07:08.048 --> 07:10.932
new preacher here now. I could do his name. Me and 
Judith belong to that church up there. Is he a good

07:20.247 --> 07:21.288
preacher? I don't think I have to do that. What sort 
of preacher is he? Some day I was preparing to go to

07:26.075 --> 07:28.219
the church. Some folks from St. Margaret's come, 
and I didn't go. Well, what do you think about

07:31.504 --> 07:33.987
Reverend Reese as a preacher? Well, Reverend 
Reese, he's... Wouldn't have ever reached Miss

07:36.989 --> 07:39.511
Fanny's picture. No, but friendly with that. He's 
just a good friend of mine. Yes, he's a good friend

07:44.335 --> 07:45.456
of mine. I like him fine. He's been to my house. He 
has? Yeah. He thanks a lot of you, too. Yes, he's

07:50.541 --> 07:52.062
been to my house. I like him fine. He's been to my 
house several times. Hey, Larry, how has times

07:57.667 --> 08:04.733
changed since you came to Austin? Oh, I don't know. 
Times changed. We've had churches, different

08:07.567 --> 08:11.972
things. Did you ever think you'd live to see the 
automobile? No. I never lived to see the

08:18.699 --> 08:23.164
automobile. I heard talk of them. I heard my 
husband talk of them. He went north with a herd of

08:27.149 --> 08:31.954
bees with some white birds, and he seen them like 
that. Is that right? He was a cowboy. Which husband

08:34.612 --> 08:36.095
was that? That's Jim Smith, my first husband, all 
these children's fathers. Oh, he saw the mobiles

08:39.500 --> 08:43.225
then when he went up with the very cowboys. Yes, 
yes, and he'd come by and say, I saw these airplanes

08:43.245 --> 08:47.832
and things. Is that right? He came up and told you 
that? Well, yes, but we didn't know what it was.

08:52.719 --> 08:57.887
Well, Lord, he was killed for a turn in the century 
before 1900, wasn't he? No, he was killed in 1901.

08:59.849 --> 09:00.270
1901. We had a thing up north with a herd of bees, you 
know, for cattle. Who did he work for? Well, he

09:06.485 --> 09:08.187
worked for different people. We worked for 
ourselves then. We bought a home of our own.

09:18.962 --> 09:20.524
Yes, right. You plowed in the field, hey? Sure, I 
did. Plowed and chucked cotton. I could drop corn

09:26.392 --> 09:28.575
in this place. I walked that way. Grandmother,

09:29.917 --> 09:33.302
too. Yes, ma'am. What was the name of your oxen, do 
you remember? Oh, I've got one of them named Jerry

09:37.367 --> 09:40.692
and the other named Broad. And named what? Broad. 
Jerry and Broad. Yes, you put them hootin' and the

09:44.777 --> 09:51.867
oxen go round and plow. Yes, I don't know if my 
children are the seeding oxen. Hmm.

10:10.552 --> 10:28.459
You

10:10.552 --> 10:28.459
have the word of God, sir. All right, that's that. 
We have the word of God. We have the word of God. We

10:29.962 --> 10:30.443
have the word of God. We have the word of God. 
Father, we thank you for the darkness of the night,

10:30.963 --> 10:33.207
for the moment of beautiful time today in the name 
of Jesus. Now, step us up into this moment and keep

10:33.227 --> 10:34.669
us out of trouble and thunder.

10:39.644 --> 11:07.035
Thank

10:39.644 --> 11:07.035
you. I

11:07.015 --> 11:18.553
was born and born in North, in the back of North 
Carolina, in the night city. Well back in the

11:18.573 --> 11:19.877
street, young woman in the middle of the street. Go

11:22.186 --> 11:35.476
right ahead, go right ahead. How old are you, Miss 
Williams? Me? I'm in my 80s. In my 18 years. You were

11:36.839 --> 11:37.240
born where? Born in North Carolina, there, right 
here. Well,

11:38.740 --> 12:05.641
back in North Carolina. How did they treat you? 
Now, when did you first find the Word of God? Well,

12:09.200 --> 12:29.136
I was out of a gospel land and a Bible country. And I 
was six months, no education. I was six months

12:29.877 --> 12:30.779
seeking my soul's salvation. And out of a gospel 
land and a Bible country, and no church time, going

12:30.799 --> 12:32.602
to the farm field. Instead, going to the church, 
home to the church. But

12:34.259 --> 12:49.326
when our own master did love this kind of people, we 
didn't judge them. That is when I was told. But

12:49.847 --> 12:51.309
after my own master knew this guy, and he never 
thought he could win. In fact, he couldn't win the

12:51.329 --> 12:52.251
big championship. Why,

12:52.889 --> 13:16.452
of course, there's children. And then, at the time 
that I didn't have children, I didn't have the Word

13:16.472 --> 13:18.093
of God. And you know, what Sunday, Saturday, I'd be 
down there in the sun, half past the first of the

13:18.113 --> 13:22.217
day, and sitting in my cellar, and the children 
would be sitting on me, and we'd all be praying,

13:18.113 --> 13:22.217
sitting on me. I'd pray it in the morning. And

13:23.281 --> 13:32.937
four days in the morning, going to Irish, and so 
forget I went, and so knowing the Irish. I

13:34.756 --> 13:54.906
know nothing about heaven, God, or Christ. I have 
to get out of here before it's too long. And he

13:55.888 --> 13:57.490
looked up to me, and he said to me, and he said to me, 
and he said to me, Oh,

13:57.470 --> 14:13.887
my God. Oh, my God. as

14:14.834 --> 14:29.836
it means for God and for no man. And children, you 
can get up to four steps only, but God says, keep him

14:29.856 --> 14:32.559
and be born of him, and keep his commandments, born 
now of him. Why do we propose this to our teachers,

14:32.579 --> 14:34.362
to our students, to bring them from head to head? .

14:52.396 --> 14:52.416
. . . . shooting

14:52.516 --> 15:05.883
fire on one of his women's children in 1953. That's 
very true. Don't worry about it. Don't worry.

15:06.965 --> 15:07.386
Don't worry about it.

15:19.246 --> 15:41.025
I

15:19.246 --> 15:41.025
said, thank God for the hand of my angel. He said, 
they're killing me now. I said, they're going to

15:41.706 --> 15:42.586
hit me in the head. I said, hey, look in here. It's 
salvation over me. Hey, look right there over me.

15:44.248 --> 15:44.768
And I've been born to God. I said, they're killing 
me. I said, glory to God, children. He said, no

15:45.989 --> 15:46.590
one's stopping me. I said, I kept my first faith. So 
I didn't let that go in my head anymore. There's an

15:48.111 --> 15:48.512
old ship. There's an old ship. And

15:48.912 --> 16:10.545
how the children, with my own mother left back 
behind, used to give her so nice to the old, they

15:48.912 --> 16:10.545
would give her just like golden sisters, the white 
children. They were all raised up together. One

16:11.246 --> 16:12.047
went back home too late in the fall. The other went 
back home. And they'd be holding her on their feet,

16:12.588 --> 16:14.351
the white children, like that, for half a year. And 
we'd put her on ours. And we'd put her, we'd put her

16:14.892 --> 16:15.713
on Gary's. And

16:15.693 --> 16:40.671
then the youngest woman had the knife before she 
could... It's

16:40.651 --> 16:52.112
too high. I

16:53.138 --> 17:10.641
used to say, I want a poor old man to hire me. I used to 
see a rich man. I used to see a lot of people who were

17:11.181 --> 17:12.763
just saying, my own book, my own person. A poor old 
man had five foundations. Is there that kind of

17:13.524 --> 17:14.405
thing in this country? We need a hero. He killed 
everything. Cows, wood cows, daisies. Walk

17:16.493 --> 17:37.841
out of it, move the planet, find the same heart and 
wish for it. And that's how it is. I've been raised.

17:38.662 --> 17:39.143
Just don't play with me. Don't play with me. The 
woman came away from heaven, and the woman is here.

17:40.685 --> 17:41.065
Look, I was raised. I was raised in all of this. I 
know I'm over it all in my 80 years, and I know I look

17:41.666 --> 17:42.968
like it. But I was raised. Hold me in your hands. And

17:49.163 --> 18:18.159
put straws, put straws down in there. And don't 
stick us in the middle of the middle. Why

18:19.100 --> 18:46.395
do you do that? Why do you do that? and

18:47.821 --> 19:02.606
holding our work. And we just took that, you know, 
and we came in now, came in now, we were staying, we

19:02.627 --> 19:06.994
were in the building, in the office building, and 
then we took this book to America, and it was so many

19:02.627 --> 19:06.994
problems we were in America. This

19:07.683 --> 19:28.459
is life. This is life, mere life. You will pray to 
God. You will pray to God all the time. You will pray

19:30.121 --> 19:30.803
to God all the time. You will pray to God all the 
time. You will pray to God all the time. You

19:32.438 --> 19:57.414
must go and go and you will see me now. You will die. 
You will die. You will die. You will die. You will

19:58.556 --> 19:58.816
die. You will die. You will die. You will die. You 
will die. You will die. God

20:00.586 --> 20:27.488
is the King of all my joy. They

20:27.603 --> 20:32.112
love the wild ones.

20:44.208 --> 21:08.933
A

20:44.208 --> 21:08.933
hundred and one.

21:13.385 --> 21:31.121
I

21:13.385 --> 21:31.121
see the people. I see the people. I see the people. I 
see the people. Who's

21:32.183 --> 21:52.810
wrong? It was... I

21:52.990 --> 22:12.140
love the kind of thing that, you know, they were 
going away. They're done crazy shit over there,

22:12.160 --> 22:13.382
and they were going away. And I know it was, what, 
two or three people that were going away. I don't

22:14.744 --> 22:15.005
know. I don't know. And

22:15.265 --> 22:32.157
they were going away, they were going on the stage 
road leading to the north. And they were needing

22:32.177 --> 22:32.718
that. And when they got in the stage road, about two 
miles, the man on the side with the bag hanging

22:32.738 --> 22:35.383
toward him, you know, down his waist. One

22:35.363 --> 23:01.759
on the back, one on the back, two on the back, two on 
the back, two on the back, two on the back, two on the

22:35.363 --> 23:01.759
back, If

23:01.739 --> 23:16.855
he was in this manor, we might have got a good home 
over here. If he was in this manor, we might have got

23:16.875 --> 23:18.178
a good home over here. He

23:18.158 --> 23:36.031
said, he said, I'm going to put it on my drum and I'm 
going to play. I'm going to do it. I'm going to put it

23:36.452 --> 23:37.514
on my drum and I'm going to play. And I'm going to put 
it on my drum and I'm going to play. And I'm going to

23:38.696 --> 23:39.137
play. I

23:39.117 --> 24:01.043
want to thank you. I want to thank you. Thank

24:01.443 --> 24:17.072
you. Hi.

24:49.891 --> 25:15.575
William

24:49.891 --> 25:15.575
Nelson Thomas. Brown, Robert Stafford Jones, and 
Dunsley County. Virginia. Virginia. Well, in

25:16.996 --> 25:17.277
1844. How old are you now? Well, how old are I now? 
Well, that's 47, really quick. I

25:19.456 --> 25:35.575
ain't gonna move, sir.

25:45.443 --> 26:07.079
I

25:45.443 --> 26:07.079
was born in Daniels, Florida, Virginia. And I was 
born on the second floor off of this window. Second

26:08.200 --> 26:08.661
floor, I'm four. Fifth floor. Fifth. Fifth. 
Fifth. Fifth. Fifth. Fifth.

26:34.668 --> 27:02.887
Oh,

26:34.668 --> 27:02.887
yeah. No, they were short.

27:06.325 --> 27:28.073
My

27:06.325 --> 27:28.073
name is Charles Taylor. Where are you from? I'm 
going here for dinner. Period period. The second

27:29.335 --> 27:31.077
year, or the third year after the third year, the 
year after the third year. In general, how long,

27:31.097 --> 27:33.080
how long I've been here, fourth year of the month, 
I'm not going to tell you. Thank you for that.

27:37.848 --> 28:04.157
Man

27:37.848 --> 28:04.157
Vita. Three, two, one. You

28:04.882 --> 28:29.193
didn't motivate people? No, of course not.

28:34.750 --> 28:35.935
They wouldn't give a shit.

28:48.183 --> 29:11.634
.

29:11.654 --> 29:11.674
. . . . Mother,

29:11.774 --> 29:32.430
what were you up to? I didn't do anything but take 
the basket and move it. This is the day. It's a half a

29:33.872 --> 29:34.373
mile apart. Thank

29:34.353 --> 29:48.210
you. .

30:11.470 --> 30:11.490
. . . . . My

30:11.630 --> 30:30.333
mother raised 300 or 400 people in Latin America. 
That's what your father did. My father believed in

30:30.933 --> 30:31.494
Jesus. He was like that. But my mother didn't do no 
that. She didn't know what she could do. We

30:33.196 --> 30:55.017
do anything, we cook. We drink no water, no milk. We 
don't even wash our hands. That's her daughter,

30:56.198 --> 30:57.159
that's her daughter-in-law. She has a daughter 
named Mia, she has a son. We don't do anything. We

30:58.520 --> 30:58.941
don't do anything. We don't do anything. We don't 
do anything. We don't do anything. We don't do

31:00.282 --> 31:00.702
anything. We don't do anything. We don't do 
anything.

31:09.848 --> 31:39.006
.

31:39.026 --> 31:39.046
. . . . . . . . . Thank

31:40.308 --> 31:56.410
you.
