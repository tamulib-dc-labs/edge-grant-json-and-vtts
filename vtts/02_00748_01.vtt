00:03.760 --> 00:07.465
First of all, Mr. Kerbo, would you tell us 
something about your early life? Include the

00:08.005 --> 00:21.683
names of your parents, places and dates of their 
birth and death, the place where you were born and

00:08.005 --> 00:21.683
the date of your birth, and the schools you 
attended before you came to Texas A&M. My father

00:23.105 --> 00:33.598
was born in Georgia in 1856, and It was in a rural 
community.

00:40.437 --> 00:57.207
I don't know of any large town there, but it was in 
the area to the northeast of Atlanta somewhere

00:40.437 --> 00:57.207
because I recall hearing

00:40.437 --> 00:57.207
him talk, speak of

00:59.903 --> 01:11.381
Being on the edge of Sherman's march to the sea, he 
saw and heard some of the soldiers

00:59.903 --> 01:11.381
coming and going during that time. And

01:12.422 --> 01:23.920
his name was H.C.

01:12.422 --> 01:23.920
Harrison C. Kerbo.

01:25.587 --> 01:45.327
Several of the, he, his father and

01:25.587 --> 01:45.327
several families of the Curbos came to northeast 
Texas along about 1867

01:25.587 --> 01:45.327
and settled in Red River County. Later on, they 
moved to, some of them moved over into Delta

01:46.348 --> 01:54.936
County, close to Cooper, Texas.

01:55.912 --> 01:59.697
That is where I was born in 1895. My mother also was 
born before the Civil War. She was born in 1860 in

02:08.528 --> 02:15.918
Octobahaw County, Mississippi.

02:18.942 --> 02:23.488
And her family also came to Texas long about that 
time and settled in the area somewhere around

02:24.599 --> 02:31.087
where Sherman now is, whatever county that might 
be. And later they also moved to Delta County. In

02:37.375 --> 02:52.193
1900,

02:37.375 --> 02:52.193
my father sold out his business in Delta County and 
moved to West Texas in Fisher County.

02:53.624 --> 03:14.594
raised

02:53.624 --> 03:14.594
some livestock and did a little farming and had a 
general merchandise country store and post

02:53.624 --> 03:14.594
office about 20 miles west of Stamford and 20 miles 
from Robie. It was quite an isolated country,

03:14.634 --> 03:19.160
territory in those days. Then in 1905, The family 
moved to Clarendon, Texas when I was about 10 years

03:23.122 --> 03:29.412
old. And I went through grade high school in 
Clarendon, Texas, and then went from there to

03:30.534 --> 03:42.975
Texas A&M. How did you make the move first to the 
vicinity of Stanford? I beg your pardon? how how

03:49.683 --> 04:17.142
was the move made from east texas to stamford it was 
made by uh it was made by a train with a chartered car

03:49.683 --> 04:17.142
to carry livestock and household goods and so on 
and then by wagon to be placed west of stamford over

03:49.683 --> 04:17.142
in fisher county then in the move from

04:19.501 --> 04:32.138
Fisher County to Clarendon was made in with a wagon 
and Surrey and then also a chartered car to carry

04:19.501 --> 04:32.138
household goods and so on. We went through in a 
wagon and Surrey covered wagon. Must have been

04:40.288 --> 04:43.453
quite an experience for a ten-year-old boy. Well 
yes, however I had another experience Prior to

04:49.083 --> 05:18.043
that, when we were living in Fisher County, and I 
was about seven, I guess, years old, along about

04:49.083 --> 05:18.043
1902, I suppose it was, our family, the younger 
children in our family and two other families with

04:49.083 --> 05:18.043
children, decided to have a vacation trip up 
across the plains, wagon, covered wagon trip. And

05:19.255 --> 05:22.398
we did, and that was quite an experience. And I 
remember Lubbock particularly because I never

05:22.538 --> 05:34.270
had seen so many windmills in one place in all my 
life as they were here. And I recall watering our

05:35.091 --> 05:49.245
livestock, horses, going with my father to water 
those at a stock trough. I believe by the

05:49.748 --> 05:54.093
courthouse, the old courthouse, wherever that 
was. It was in Lubbock? Here in Lubbock. We camped

05:56.757 --> 06:03.084
somewhere off outside the city. By today's 
standards, one would hardly think of a trek across

06:03.104 --> 06:08.391
the plains by wagon as a vacation. No, I guess not. 
But it was lots of fun for we kids. We had no cares at

06:15.760 --> 06:17.342
all. What factors were involved in your decision 
to go to Texas A&M as opposed to, say, some other

06:19.634 --> 06:26.082
school? I think one thing was I understood that it 
didn't cost as much as some other schools. And also

06:33.072 --> 06:46.249
there was a man named Sawyer

06:33.072 --> 06:46.249
who was, I believe, an 1870-some-odd

06:33.072 --> 06:46.249
graduate or student. at A&M who lived in the 
country. And his son, several years older than I,

06:49.380 --> 06:56.686
had gone there also. And another boy named Edwin 
Patterson and myself decided we would go down and

06:58.588 --> 07:08.376
become electrical engineers. We'd been fooling 
around with radio and the old dot dash sort of stuff

07:16.823 --> 07:26.518
and thought that we'd go down there and become 
electrical engineers. He did, but I didn't. I

07:29.102 --> 07:30.784
noted that you were in architecture. Yes. I 
switched to architecture after my first year and

07:31.966 --> 07:39.358
found out that there was so much math in the regular 
engineering course. What procedures did you go

07:41.060 --> 07:44.265
through to enter Texas A&M? we got a catalog and 
found out how many units I believe they called it in

07:46.777 --> 08:14.623
those days of high school work you had to have to 
enter and I believe I just barely had enough

07:46.777 --> 08:14.623
because we we only had 11 grades in high school at 
that time and

07:46.777 --> 08:14.623
I recall going to the superintendent of our high 
school and asking him to

08:15.599 --> 08:27.361
support me in my efforts to go there, and he did. 
Yeah, I think he wrote a letter or something like

08:27.701 --> 08:30.106
that. Our high school wasn't the best in the world, 
I guess, but maybe we learned some things that they

08:31.689 --> 08:39.042
don't learn now. I believe there was a period, and 
it probably was during the time that you entered

08:39.325 --> 08:53.327
A&M, that there were schools that were so-called 
affiliated with A&M, and if you completed one of

08:39.325 --> 08:53.327
those, then you could be accepted without an 
entrance exam. Well, I did not take an entrance

08:53.888 --> 09:00.338
exam, but I don't know whether we were affiliated 
or not. But anyway, the letter that he wrote, I got

09:00.358 --> 09:07.729
entrance there. There weren't so many students 
trying to go there then. What were your first

09:11.120 --> 09:18.068
reactions to Texas A&M and to what there was of the 
community of College Station when you arrived?

09:21.091 --> 09:23.433
I hardly know. Of course, I was lonesome. I was 
barely 17 years old. And

09:28.959 --> 09:37.969
there was a little hazing going on even before 
registration.

09:40.463 --> 09:50.258
like

09:40.463 --> 09:50.258
pushing a cart with the trunks for the old boys up 
from the station. And I was a little bit disturbed,

09:50.338 --> 09:56.046
I think, long about that time. So there were some 
upperclassmen who arrived, I presume, on the same

09:56.066 --> 10:00.092
train with you? On the same train with

10:00.112 --> 10:04.639
myself. Were there any people there to meet the 
train when it arrived? I don't believe so. Perhaps

10:11.456 --> 10:15.480
they might have been, but I just don't recall that. 
But a boy named Horace Sawyer was a freshman coming

10:16.181 --> 10:33.220
in, and I believe he's one of your distinguished 
men of the school now, and a boy named E.B.

10:33.260 --> 10:37.825
Patterson, who is now dead, the three of us. And 
then there were several older students, former

10:38.210 --> 10:53.910
students, old students, arrived on the same 
train, and we got a little hazing on the train

10:38.210 --> 10:53.910
itself, I believe. We had to do a little singing for 
them, such as that, but that was all right. Okay.

11:01.940 --> 11:05.104
Then did you arrive, say, one day and register the 
next? I don't recall, just... I

11:07.960 --> 11:17.348
presume fairly quickly after you arrived there 
you were assigned to or selected a military unit.

11:17.368 --> 11:19.810
Did you have any choice in which unit you entered? I 
don't believe I had a choice. Actually, I had no

11:21.772 --> 11:36.685
reason to prefer one over another, and I was 
assigned to Company K.

11:37.677 --> 11:46.166
Company K was housed in Milner Hall, which was one 
of the real new halls at that time. So then if you

11:47.187 --> 11:57.097
were in the new hall as a fish, then you didn't have 
to go through the procedure of carrying water and

11:47.187 --> 11:57.097
wood and so forth for the upperclassmen that some 
of the boys who lived in the older dorms did. No, I

11:57.117 --> 11:57.978
didn't.

12:01.882 --> 12:04.465
We didn't have that problem in Milner Hall. I lived 
in the basement. for the first few months until

12:07.799 --> 12:13.106
they put all the attendants down. So many of them 
went home. Then I got to move up to another floor.

12:18.814 --> 12:35.055
But I did live in Foster Hall where we had wood 
stoves

12:18.814 --> 12:35.055
and wooden water problems later on. at that time 
why it was just a matter of pitching our bucket out

12:35.255 --> 13:01.077
the window hollering at a fish and pitching the 
bucket out and having him bring the water up and

12:35.255 --> 13:01.077
wood what year was that that you lived in foster uh 
let's see it was the my fourth year that had been uh i

12:35.255 --> 13:01.077
went there in 12 i guess that was in 1516, year 1516.

13:07.702 --> 13:08.062
Okay. Well then, did you live in any dorms other 
than Milner and Foster then? In Leggett. In my last

13:13.208 --> 13:15.991
year there, I lived in Leggett Hall. And that was 
another one of the fairly new... Another one of the

13:16.452 --> 13:20.296
fairly new schools. I believe Mitchell at that 
time was the newest, newest hall. I believe you

13:24.841 --> 13:27.344
said your first year you were in K Company. Were you 
all, did you... serving in different companies

13:30.436 --> 13:33.359
other than K? Well I was in K for the first

13:33.860 --> 13:42.048
two years I believe. Then I was assigned to Company 
E but I still lived in Milner the third year. Fourth

13:51.438 --> 13:55.262
year I was a

13:56.828 --> 14:03.575
half junior, half senior, so I wasn't assigned to 
any particular unit, as I recall. And the fifth

14:05.798 --> 14:14.727
year, I was

14:05.798 --> 14:14.727
Edson of one of the battalions. I believe, 
according to the yearbook, it was the 1st

14:15.468 --> 14:19.212
Battalion, the 2nd Regiment. I believe so. Okay. 
Would you describe a typical day during the time

14:27.254 --> 14:28.736
that you were there? Well, of course,

14:31.420 --> 14:53.193
Reveille and the dressing and trying to make 
Reveille formation on time to march down to the

14:31.420 --> 14:53.193
hall and tying the necktie on the run and that sort 
of thing. I presume wrapping your leggings No, at

14:57.106 --> 15:01.915
that time, we didn't have the... You didn't have 
the wrap leggings. We didn't have the wrap

15:01.935 --> 15:03.297
leggings. We had the old gray uniform. In fact, all 
the time I was there, that was our uniform. And...

15:10.029 --> 15:16.180
That's right. Of course, making Reveille... then 
marching to our meals and then going to classes. If

15:25.835 --> 15:36.152
it was muddy, how the old sticky soil would boil up 
on your heels and your shoes and so on. Yeah, there

15:36.172 --> 15:37.514
were no sidewalks. No sidewalks. We had gravel, 
supposedly gravel sidewalks, but, you know, in

15:38.856 --> 15:48.291
wet weather like we have down there, why? Any 
boardwalks? No, we didn't have any boardwalks

15:50.126 --> 15:53.730
that I recall. Seen a few pictures that had some 
that I think primarily they were around the

15:55.533 --> 16:00.379
professor's homes, though. Perhaps, perhaps so.

16:08.228 --> 16:10.431
What did you do for entertainment and recreation? 
Well, there really wasn't any. Of course, we

16:15.048 --> 16:22.116
played baseball in season, and we played a little 
football in season. I mean, I was not large enough

16:22.136 --> 16:38.494
to play football, and I couldn't hit well enough to 
play varsity baseball, but I could play company

16:22.136 --> 16:38.494
football and baseball and basketball. although 
we knew very little about basketball then. It was

16:41.909 --> 16:47.998
on outside courts, dirt, cinder. Where were those 
courts, do you remember? No, they were scattered

16:50.561 --> 17:01.557
around over two or three places because two 
companies would go together to form a team, like I

16:50.561 --> 17:01.557
and K companies. We had our baseball team. Would 
this be in all sports then? In all the sports, you

17:04.597 --> 17:07.542
had two companies go together to form a team. Yes, 
at that time, yes. And there really, there wasn't

17:10.246 --> 17:15.975
any particular entertainment. We'd try to get to 
go to Bryan on occasion if we could get a permit to do

17:16.075 --> 17:24.568
that. We had to get a permit in the first year or two 
that I was there, as I recall. It could be denied or

17:32.356 --> 17:39.608
it could be approved by the commandant or the 
assistant commandant. And it had to be exactly

17:40.750 --> 17:48.122
correctly done or it would be disapproved. And 
then there were other limitations on going to

17:48.963 --> 17:59.460
Brown Financial. I guess that affects all 
students. It doesn't seem to affect too many of

18:04.158 --> 18:06.140
them today. Well, perhaps not now. Some of them 
only have two cars now on the local campus here.

18:19.237 --> 18:22.461
You said, I believe earlier, that you lived in two 
of the newer dormitories and one of the older ones.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.793
What was life like in those dormitories? Was it 
pretty hectic or was it pretty well controlled? It

18:30.637 --> 18:32.039
was pretty well controlled. Of course it was 
during study hours in particular, but there were

18:33.241 --> 18:51.469
lots of, except during study hours, there were 
lots of bull sessions that students would gang up

18:33.241 --> 18:51.469
in one room swap stores and tell lies that about 
what all they had done I suppose but

18:51.955 --> 19:19.735
during during after called quarters everything 
was in everyone was in the military department at

18:51.955 --> 19:19.735
that time after called quarters and until

19:22.162 --> 19:35.561
tattoo which I believe came at I don't recall 10 15 
perhaps why things were pretty quiet. Did you have

19:35.581 --> 19:40.889
a student patrolling the hallways? Students 
walking post in the hallways yes and I have had to

19:40.909 --> 19:48.760
walk some posts in there in fact I don't suppose you 
have ever seen old Pfeiffer Hall. The only

19:54.809 --> 19:56.150
pictures of it. It was, I recall, a walking post 
there because the floor, every step you took by the

19:56.170 --> 20:07.241
floor creaked. So then you had to walk post in a 
dormitory in which you did not live. Oh yes, yes. If

20:12.606 --> 20:19.793
you were assigned a post, just like you would be in 
the service during Did you ever have to walk post in

20:21.983 --> 20:24.245
your own dormitory? I don't recall that I ever did. 
In fact, I believe only the first year that I had to

20:27.769 --> 20:32.093
walk post. I don't recall having to walk post other 
than the first year. Was it always just the

20:37.318 --> 20:40.882
freshmen who walked the post? You know, I don't 
recall. Or did they discontinue the practice

20:42.964 --> 20:45.046
after that? Well, no, they didn't discontinue the 
practice, I don't believe, while I was there. They

20:53.472 --> 21:13.214
did discontinue the practice of requiring a 
written permit to visit Brown because that only

20:53.472 --> 21:13.214
lasted about a year after I got there, I believe, or 
so. Did the students, in addition to the bull

21:13.234 --> 21:21.623
sessions, did they play games in the dorms, rooms, 
like dominoes or cards or anything of that nature?

21:21.653 --> 21:23.375
I don't remember that they did. I don't believe so. 
I believe at one point there were rules that

21:24.657 --> 21:28.682
forbade the cards on campus. I think so. I think so. 
Also cigarettes. How about cigars and chewing

21:32.868 --> 21:34.770
tobacco? Cigars, I believe, were not

21:36.893 --> 21:42.460
allowed. Chewing tobacco was not ruled out 
because I recall I did a little cartooning while I

21:43.161 --> 21:51.492
was there. for the battalion, and I made a strip 
like mutton, Jeff,

21:52.265 --> 22:12.266
and I believe one of them asked the other for a 
cigarette, and he didn't have any cigarettes, but

21:52.265 --> 22:12.266
he had some Star Navy, and it was cheaper anyway. 
And that was a popular brand at the time? Star Navy

22:15.409 --> 22:18.272
tobacco, oh yes, it was very popular. But 
actually, there was some cigarette smoking going

22:19.315 --> 22:26.242
on, although not too many boys. Was that a serious 
punishable offense if you were caught? Yes, it

22:30.666 --> 22:35.131
was, but I don't recall what the amount of 
punishment was. As a matter of fact, you got, I

22:36.092 --> 22:42.298
believe they call it rams. You got rammed for lots 
of things. I spent some time on the campus working

22:50.281 --> 22:56.127
around on the grounds, working off demerits. So 
you would work off your demerits that way rather

22:57.088 --> 23:01.693
than marching in the bullring or something? I 
never did have to march. I don't, I believe that

23:04.255 --> 23:06.498
came along after. I see. But I did do some work for 
the grounds. What was the food like? food was good,

23:20.504 --> 23:24.849
but wholesome.

23:24.910 --> 23:37.445
Not always very tasty, but it

23:24.910 --> 23:37.445
was something that I suppose they still gripe 
about. We griped about it, but it was all right. Did

23:40.089 --> 23:41.871
it get pretty monotonous at times? Yes, it did. And 
of course, we had all kinds of names for various

23:43.542 --> 23:51.571
things, which I wouldn't do to write up. But at

23:51.591 --> 24:04.426
Speza Hall, we had Mexican waiters at that time, 
didn't have any student waiters.

24:07.690 --> 24:08.871
And the freshmen had to sit in the middle of the 
table, his long table, usually with a senior at

24:10.420 --> 24:36.161
each end and...

24:10.420 --> 24:36.161
Juniors and sophomores... Juniors and 
sophomores according to rank on down towards the

24:10.420 --> 24:36.161
middle and the freshmen of course in the middle. I 
have eaten some When I was a freshman, I have eaten

24:39.428 --> 24:48.481
some parts of my meal under the table for violating 
some... The upperclassmen would put you under the

24:48.501 --> 24:51.385
table. Yes, yes. I guess all of us about that time 
did. Did the upperclassmen have various devious

24:55.050 --> 25:01.279
means of obtaining your dessert or your kush at 
that point? Oh, yes. Yeah, they'd talk about

25:02.240 --> 25:05.084
how... They'd give it some description that you 
just that would tend to turn your stomach, and you

25:09.466 --> 25:16.492
didn't want any kush.

25:20.555 --> 25:23.998
I've had that done, too. However, I developed 
pretty good resistance to that, because I liked

25:24.018 --> 25:31.605
kush.

25:34.867 --> 25:39.051
Did the upperclassmen have any privileges that 
were not accorded to the freshmen? Oh, yes, but I

25:41.225 --> 25:43.829
don't recall what they were. Yes, sure, the 
upperclassmen had lots of privileges that the

25:44.229 --> 25:52.662
freshmen didn't have. I presume that ability of 
doing a little hazing was one. Oh, yes, yes.

25:59.391 --> 26:10.067
However, hazing was never a real problem because I 
noticed that the

25:59.391 --> 26:10.067
upperclassmen didn't haze freshmen whom they 
didn't like personally. And of course, the

26:16.515 --> 26:36.760
freshmen, we,

26:16.515 --> 26:36.760
at least I did, and I guess some of the others did, we 
used to tease the upperclassmen or kid them about

26:16.515 --> 26:36.760
how weak they were when they hit us with a broom or a 
belt. We'd ask them if that was as hard as they could

26:36.840 --> 26:40.645
hit, and of course, That brought it on a little more 
severely. But hazing was not a problem. I imagine

26:49.040 --> 26:52.145
it would be a problem only for those who sort of took 
offense to it. Yes, and not too many of them did that

26:52.445 --> 27:07.290
because, as I said, the upperclassmen

26:52.445 --> 27:07.290
didn't haze students that they didn't like. Was it 
primarily confined to an individual company? I

27:13.287 --> 27:17.311
mean, the upperclassmen in Company K, Hayes only, 
the freshmen in K? That's right. They didn't cross

27:18.032 --> 27:19.834
company lines? No, I don't recall any crossing of 
lines, company lines. In fact, I presume that

27:23.317 --> 27:37.632
as upperclassmen, we wouldn't have liked it for 
somebody in another dormitory or another company

27:23.317 --> 27:37.632
to invade our company. That was sacred ground 
wasn't it? Yes it was.

27:45.942 --> 27:51.470
Did the cadet officers enjoy any particular 
privileges over above the other cadets?

27:54.694 --> 27:55.175
Yes. I don't recall just what all privileges we 
had. We could visit during study hours

28:02.705 --> 28:08.513
when we were seniors. We didn't have to go to chapel 
if we didn't want to. And we could want unless we

28:15.501 --> 28:19.667
were company officers. And some of those could 
wander down to the mess hall without marching with

28:21.970 --> 28:31.162
the company. This would be the regimental staff. 
Well, the regimental staff and of course, the

28:42.260 --> 28:52.593
At

28:42.260 --> 28:52.593
meal time, certain meal time, the seniors did not 
have to march to the mess hall. They could walk

28:52.613 --> 28:54.636
down. If someone was there to take the company 
down, say. So primarily if, what, you'd have one of

29:03.307 --> 29:07.052
the sergeants? Perhaps march the company down. 
Maybe one officer or the first sergeant, and the

29:09.472 --> 29:16.084
rest of them could do as they wanted. How often was 
chapel? You said they could escape chapel

29:18.508 --> 29:21.092
occasionally. The seniors could escape chapel 
any time, as I recall.

29:33.475 --> 29:47.037
The rest of the students were marched to chapel, 
and of course, some of them escaped by dodging

29:33.475 --> 29:47.037
around back in Foster Hall or Ross Hall or some of 
those. And dropping out of formation and scooting

29:47.357 --> 29:50.021
around the corner. Oh, yes, drop out of formation. 
Was this only on Sunday that you had chapel, or was

29:51.223 --> 29:54.008
it more frequently? No, it's Sundays.

29:57.794 --> 29:58.254
Did you have any? It was required that we go to 
chapel. but it was required that you go, but

30:00.965 --> 30:03.649
apparently they didn't check roll. No, no, nobody 
would tell them. Did you have any favorite

30:08.657 --> 30:11.081
instructors while you were there? Yes, yes, I did. 
I had a number of favorites. Tell us about them.

30:17.791 --> 30:18.352
Well, D.B. Cofer was one whom I became acquainted 
with first.

30:29.551 --> 30:46.564
I recall the first time our class was in his 
classroom, on the board we saw the most perfect

30:29.551 --> 30:46.564
script that you can imagine.
