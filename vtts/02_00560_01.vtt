00:04.351 --> 00:11.403
What was your background situation at the time you 
joined the church, and how do you think it affected

00:04.351 --> 00:11.403
your decision to join? At the time that I joined, I 
was a sophomore in college at Kansas State

00:13.827 --> 00:19.737
University. I first met a group of three people who 
identified themselves as members of a unified

00:21.059 --> 00:28.131
family. In November of 1972, they just invited me 
over to have a meal with them and to talk with some of

00:29.562 --> 00:46.963
their ideas about engendering cooperation 
between different denominations and working for

00:29.562 --> 00:46.963
social change. Well, it happened to hit me in a very 
sensitive spot. I had gone to Kansas State

00:50.688 --> 01:03.965
University in the midst of a rather difficult 
decision about whether I would be involved with

00:50.688 --> 01:03.965
war or not and had decided to be a conscientious 
objector. I was very serious about faith matters.

01:06.668 --> 01:14.959
I'd even changed churches while I was a senior in 
high school in order to become involved in a church

01:06.668 --> 01:14.959
that had peace ideals. I was involved with student 
government and was studying English to be an

01:16.576 --> 01:27.227
English as a second language teacher because I 
felt a very strong sense of social

01:16.576 --> 01:27.227
responsibility. Also, on a personal level, I had 
experienced and did continue to experience

01:28.068 --> 01:44.625
through this sophomore year a large number of 
disappointments with friends, with a girlfriend

01:28.068 --> 01:44.625
I was involved with. And also with classes, 
professors. It was just a very difficult year as a

01:47.956 --> 01:50.665
sophomore year often is. How do you think that 
affected your decision to join the church? Well, I

01:55.625 --> 02:02.695
don't think that I would have been so... Well, of 
course, you have to remember the time this was.

02:02.755 --> 02:06.380
People were not talking about a cult, and nobody 
knew anything about the Unification Church. I

02:06.400 --> 02:11.927
didn't find out that the name of it was Unification 
Church until April when I joined, as a matter of

02:06.400 --> 02:11.927
fact. But that didn't make any difference to me 
then anyway, because nobody knew anything about

02:11.987 --> 02:17.315
it at that point in the early 70s in Kansas. I think 
that they had been going on the coast for a while,

02:17.575 --> 02:21.160
and a few people knew, but... I still think, 
though, that there were a lot of things about the

02:22.186 --> 02:27.421
group that I found very strange. Some of their 
theological ideas I just sort of brushed off as

02:27.621 --> 02:37.208
being off the wall, but they were nice people, and I 
had worked with people with whom I had differences

02:27.621 --> 02:37.208
before. But I don't think I would have been so 
willing to make the kind of commitment that I made

02:37.188 --> 02:52.641
to them had I not been in a situation where I just 
desperately needed friendship, some people who

02:37.188 --> 02:52.641
were planning to be consistent, and also some 
structure in my life. I had a lot of difficult

02:52.681 --> 02:56.209
decisions to make and nobody really helped me make 
them. I had kind of cut myself adrift from my family

02:56.189 --> 03:13.489
in a number of different ways, not that we had 
always been that close, but particularly with my

02:56.189 --> 03:13.489
decision to be a CO, my father, who had been in both 
the Army and the Air Force, was not at all happy

02:56.189 --> 03:13.489
about that, as you can well imagine. And so I had a 
hard time drawing on people. And some of the people

03:18.294 --> 03:20.577
who I depended on I had fallen out of my life. I had 
grown close to a girl during high school, but we

03:23.046 --> 03:32.675
were unable to make things work out on weekends to 
be able to spend time together, so that

03:23.046 --> 03:32.675
relationship sort of dwindled.

03:35.758 --> 03:40.563
The president of the student body and I became very 
close friends and decided to move in together

03:35.758 --> 03:40.563
during the sophomore year. And he had a house that 
he was renting and one of his roommates had moved

03:41.203 --> 03:47.229
out, so I moved in at semester break. Well, he left 
school. of his responsibilities and left me with a

03:50.257 --> 03:53.521
house to rent. So there were just a lot of very 
difficult things happening. I do think that it

03:56.586 --> 04:10.845
would have been much less likely that I would have 
gotten involved as a member had I been at a more

03:56.586 --> 04:10.845
stable position in life. Do you think there are 
common personality traits or common past

04:10.865 --> 04:18.475
experiences among Unification Church members? 
That's an interesting question.

04:26.104 --> 04:30.118
I don't really think that you would say common 
personality traits. in that you would find all

04:30.959 --> 04:34.164
kinds of people in Unification Church. By far, the 
majority of the members were young, that is to say,

04:34.464 --> 04:44.399
college age to early 30s, white middle class.

04:47.103 --> 04:57.118
I would say there was probably a fairly large 
number of Roman Catholics involved in

04:47.103 --> 04:57.118
relationship to the population of the United 
States, but that's just a guess. I mean, that's a

04:57.198 --> 04:58.319
pure guess. I have no data on that at all. Very low 
percentage of minorities, almost no blacks at

05:00.743 --> 05:07.411
all, very few Hispanics. Very few people from 
either lower income groups

05:09.533 --> 05:17.984
or the very, very wealthy. Again, that's sort of a 
guess. The lower income groups I would say pretty

05:19.245 --> 05:22.549
definitely.

05:24.250 --> 05:38.173
Different groups of this type, fringe groups that 
are often identified as cults, such as the

05:24.250 --> 05:38.173
Children of God and the Hare Krishna movement, 
seem to exhibit sort of the same kind of profile.

05:38.754 --> 05:45.105
Other groups, like the Jim Jones People's Temple, 
seem to draw on a different group. For them, it was

05:45.786 --> 05:49.532
mostly middle-aged and older blacks.

05:53.005 --> 06:00.661
So, you know, different groups seem to attract 
different kinds of individuals in terms of age

05:53.005 --> 06:00.661
groups and that sort of thing. But as far as 
personality, I would hesitate to say. I think that

06:03.567 --> 06:09.158
everybody has the propensity or the capacity for 
making sort of fanatical commitments. I mean, we

06:11.702 --> 06:16.589
all need something that we can really believe in, I 
think, and something that we can commit ourselves

06:11.702 --> 06:16.589
to. We all need to feel like we're right and we're 
doing something good. And I think that's a human

06:19.614 --> 06:27.305
trait and not necessarily just a personality 
trait of some people. I think that's a need that we

06:27.325 --> 06:31.872
all have, and that's what the Church draws on to a 
great degree.

06:38.720 --> 06:44.468
When church members first approached you, did 
they reveal affiliation with Moon? Or how long

06:45.029 --> 06:50.798
were you acquainted with them before they 
revealed that they were affiliated with Moon?

06:51.398 --> 06:54.303
Well, the name Sun Myung Moon didn't mean anything 
to me at that time. I didn't know anything about

06:54.663 --> 06:55.885
him. But no, they didn't talk about it at all until I 
got ready to join the group, which was in April. So

06:59.913 --> 07:03.099
from November to April, five or six months, 
however long that is. I did not know that it was the

07:04.301 --> 07:07.347
Unification Church. Again, that name didn't mean 
anything to me. I probably would have liked it, as a

07:09.631 --> 07:12.016
matter of fact. But as far as I knew, it was called 
the Unified Family, and that's all I knew. And what

07:15.895 --> 07:19.500
did they declare their beliefs to be? Initially, 
they did not declare that they had an independent

07:21.402 --> 07:27.870
theology. It was more like this is an ecumenical 
organization, which I assumed, and which many

07:29.112 --> 07:45.092
people did assume, and they wanted you to assume, 
you know, they led you to assume, that it was a group

07:29.112 --> 07:45.092
that rather than having independent ideas, was 
simply an organization with service ideals. And

07:45.072 --> 07:46.554
that was very attractive to me. As time went on, 
they said we should come over to our lecture

07:47.014 --> 07:50.218
series. And I realized that they did have a 
specific theology. And some of the ideas in the

07:53.662 --> 07:56.085
theology really took me aback. I was just really 
shocked. The idea that the Fall of Man was

07:57.848 --> 08:00.891
essentially a sexual act. I

08:00.911 --> 08:08.160
didn't want to laugh, but I found it pretty 
bizarre. And frankly, I think the ramifications

08:08.140 --> 08:15.832
of that were at some level sort of evident to me when 
they first told me that. I thought, gee, you could

08:15.852 --> 08:20.519
really get the real warped view of the world with 
that kind of an idea. Or I shouldn't say warped.

08:23.884 --> 08:25.567
That shows my own bias. But I just thought that 
would really affect your world view in an extreme

08:25.607 --> 08:30.094
way. And that was the point where I said, well, I've 
worked with people with whom I had differences

08:30.555 --> 08:36.544
before, who had different opinions. So it didn't 
really upset me that much. But it was a month or so

08:39.297 --> 08:43.235
after I'd first met them. I should tell you, Oh, I 
probably didn't actually go out to the center

08:46.109 --> 08:51.997
until December when we got past finals. I was a 
little bit freer in terms of time, and I think I saw

08:52.517 --> 08:57.043
them once, maybe twice before January. And then I 
didn't see them again for a couple of months. I got

09:00.928 --> 09:04.373
back into the swing of school and just didn't make 
time to go out there. I didn't feel the tug that

09:04.393 --> 09:05.955
strongly. They sent food home with me, which was a 
good ploy to use with a male who was living on his

09:06.916 --> 09:12.022
own. But...

09:17.530 --> 09:23.637
I don't think I really heard any of the lectures 
until probably March.

09:27.362 --> 09:38.095
Would you say that the social responsibility was 
your initial attraction to the

09:27.362 --> 09:38.095
group? Well, yeah, also there was a strong 
personal attraction in that

09:45.020 --> 09:50.317
The people were obviously very dedicated and 
obviously willing to make a lot of sacrifices.

09:51.259 --> 09:54.730
They lived very simply and that was attractive to 
me. They obviously had an interest in me.

10:01.861 --> 10:14.850
One of the girls in the group I found rather cute and 
interesting, although I don't think a person who I

10:01.861 --> 10:14.850
would have spent a lot of time with, but I felt like 
our personalities had a lot in common, and I would

10:01.861 --> 10:14.850
have enjoyed getting to know her better. The other 
two, not so much, but...

10:24.288 --> 10:30.871
Obviously it was a combination of personal and 
ideological

10:24.288 --> 10:30.871
reasons. How were you first approached by members 
of the church? I was in the cafeteria at K-State. As

10:39.107 --> 10:50.081
a church member, you develop an ability through 
hours and days and weeks and months of attempting

10:39.107 --> 10:50.081
to make solicitations and proselytizations. You 
develop a sense for who is going to be accessible.

10:54.967 --> 10:58.635
and they sense that I would be right away. I think 
there's a number of things involved with that. I'm

11:01.401 --> 11:05.731
willing to go up to people and make friends, you 
know, walk up and make contacts. I'm open to new

11:05.791 --> 11:08.377
things. A fairly... sensitive, emotional 
person. And I think that ends up what the person's

11:15.743 --> 11:27.474
emotional state, whether they're at a pretty 
stable place going along day to day, or whether

11:15.743 --> 11:27.474
they're in a state of emotional flux, and they're 
up and down. And experiencing a lot of emotion

11:27.494 --> 11:32.399
makes a lot of difference in terms of how 
suggestible people are. And I was probably pretty

11:33.159 --> 11:39.165
evidently at a point of some emotional flux at that 
time. I'm sure they picked up on that as well. The

11:42.670 --> 11:48.659
church members don't end up verbalizing a lot of 
that stuff. Some of them do. Some of them are more

11:49.400 --> 11:50.962
aware of it than others. I think the ones who are the 
best at it, sensitive and intuitive level, they

11:51.383 --> 11:55.488
don't even think about it. They know. During

11:56.710 --> 12:08.427
those first few contacts, were you ever exposed to 
the church's views on communism? Not at all. I

12:11.107 --> 12:15.231
wasn't particularly pro or anti-communist, so it 
wouldn't have made much difference. But no, they

12:15.251 --> 12:18.415
were careful not to talk about... I think that they 
may have mentioned it, but they certainly didn't

12:18.435 --> 12:24.482
dwell on it. And that didn't end up being a big thing 
one way or the other for me. They really talked... I

12:33.702 --> 12:36.976
mean, it was like a whole other group once I became 
involved. There was just so little that they

12:36.996 --> 12:39.747
actually told me about the group. Because there is 
such a superstructure of ideology and theology

12:41.110 --> 12:49.663
and strange ideas and reading of the speeches of 
Moon and all that kind of stuff. There's a great

12:49.683 --> 12:53.409
deal of that that goes on in the group. But that's 
all hidden from the outside. And there's an

12:57.735 --> 13:09.413
extremely intense interpersonal structure that 
every individual has his own personal leader to

12:57.735 --> 13:09.413
whom he or she is responsible. And

13:10.912 --> 13:19.925
that string goes all the way up to moon in a very 
intense fashion. And there's a lot of

13:20.125 --> 13:24.972
interpersonal manipulation that goes on all the 
way up. The idea of being loyal is an extremely high

13:26.775 --> 13:36.649
ideal and an effective means of control.

13:38.553 --> 13:40.117
But that's also hidden. You don't see any of that 
kind of stuff. It's just sort of like, well, they go

13:42.163 --> 13:47.158
to talk to different churches and have wonderful 
ideals. And it's not until you become involved

13:47.218 --> 13:53.997
that you find out that the major activities for the 
group are fundraising, proselytizing, and

13:55.512 --> 14:02.680
trying to expand their political influence in 
terms of the ideology. That's really all that gets

14:03.101 --> 14:04.422
done. And the leadership of the church is very 
aware of that. I was at a speech given by one of the

14:08.747 --> 14:12.031
Japanese leaders in Japan. He talked about that. 
Those are the three main things. They talk about

14:15.996 --> 14:19.680
building the heavenly kingdom on a basis of a...

14:22.934 --> 14:30.282
of example, that by establishing perfect 
families that are in harmony with God, then

14:22.934 --> 14:30.282
they're going to demonstrate how the world is 
supposed to be. So they do believe that they're in

14:30.803 --> 14:34.207
the process of building this kind of a kingdom and 
that sort of thing. And there are people who join

14:34.227 --> 14:38.752
the group and quit drugs because of it or that kind 
of stuff. So they're involved with drug

14:39.072 --> 14:40.714
rehabilitation. That's the kind of thinking that 
goes on. The kind of social service that they're

14:44.839 --> 14:50.325
involved in is proselytizing and fundraising. So 
after you first met those first few church

14:50.592 --> 15:02.773
members, what was the first activity that you went 
to or group meeting? Well, there were only three

15:02.793 --> 15:10.707
people in the center, only three people in the 
state of Kansas who were involved in the church at

15:02.793 --> 15:10.707
that time when I first met them. And I went over and 
just had a meal with them. And they sang some songs,

15:14.605 --> 15:17.669
which I found pretty crazy. But as a musician, 
music is fun. I think that I was given lectures

15:22.175 --> 15:27.122
individually. As I recall, they would actually 
sit down and give the lectures to me on a one-to-one

15:27.362 --> 15:33.831
basis later in the spring. But the first couple 
times that I saw them, I just went over and had lunch

15:34.712 --> 15:41.221
with them. Later on, after I... I think all of the 
lectures that I attended were on a personal,

15:44.744 --> 15:50.031
individual, under one basis. Now that's of course 
atypical. That's not at all typical for the way

15:51.813 --> 15:54.496
most people join. But after that, the first group 
activities I was involved in was as a member, being

15:55.898 --> 16:06.051
involved in the church prayer meetings and stuff 
like that. What is the typical way that most people

16:07.012 --> 16:12.439
become involved then?

16:17.279 --> 16:30.023
I think in terms of where most people are when 
they're approached, most people who join the

16:17.279 --> 16:30.023
group have fallen into the category of being at a 
more emotional point of their life. They're in

16:34.603 --> 16:44.418
situations where maybe they've had some great 
joy, they've just gotten married, or they've just

16:34.603 --> 16:44.418
moved into a new community, or maybe they've gone 
away to college. And these kinds of periods of

16:45.359 --> 16:50.046
upheaval can last for years. A person who's in 
college, it just hardly ever ends.

16:58.066 --> 17:11.249
But in any event, being in an emotional time of 
life, one tends to be somewhat less reasoned and

16:58.066 --> 17:11.249
connected to one's surroundings. You're going 
more on your own feelings. And a college student

17:13.633 --> 17:23.550
is, of course, the most unconnected person in our 
society, except maybe for the hobo.

17:25.015 --> 17:26.398
So there's that sort of thing. And what the church 
ordinarily does is meets these people on the

17:26.558 --> 17:45.758
street or on the college campus, invites them to a 
dinner and a lecture on some topic that they think

17:26.558 --> 17:45.758
will be of interest to people who are in that 
demographic area. So that is to say, when they're

17:45.738 --> 17:59.516
talking to people on the Berkeley campus, they're 
going to be approaching them somewhat

17:45.738 --> 17:59.516
differently than they will be when they're at the 
K-State campus, for example, or in the train

17:45.738 --> 17:59.516
station in Oklahoma City. But they try to aim for 
something that is a sort of low common denominator

17:59.777 --> 18:09.129
and yet still is going to interest people who may be 
susceptible. So they're not going to be as likely

18:09.229 --> 18:15.137
to go after a person who's basically agnostic, 
happily married, with a good, secure job with

18:15.117 --> 18:20.969
Donald Lynch. They're going after people who have 
some interest in different kinds of religious

18:22.592 --> 18:35.978
ideas and ideals, and people to whom an ideal city 
project might be interesting, or that sort of

18:22.592 --> 18:35.978
thing. They invite them over to a dinner and a 
lecture. They will deliver a lecture on the ideal

18:39.005 --> 18:49.167
family or the ideal world, using things that come 
from Christian theology and also from Buddhism.

18:52.274 --> 18:53.697
Pretty innocuous. somewhat bland, but very 
fervent. And the room in which they have the

18:58.727 --> 19:08.661
lecture, there will be many members of the church 
there. They will try to have as many members per new

19:09.422 --> 19:13.108
person as possible. About a one-to-one ratio is 
ideal. But there are times when they may have more

19:15.952 --> 19:19.476
new people than they have members. But in those 
instances, it's very hard for them to control the

19:19.956 --> 19:25.662
energy in the room and control the atmosphere. 
Then that's what they really want to do. They will

19:28.004 --> 19:29.045
sing songs. They may have prayers. It depends. San 
Francisco, they probably won't. But in Des

19:33.289 --> 19:37.153
Moines, they will, definitely. Or in Dallas.

19:43.019 --> 19:48.608
And then after that they'll invite them to go to a 
weekend workshop. And the fee, if any, will be

19:49.094 --> 19:51.977
minimal. At the weekend workshop, they will 
receive the same introductory lecture with

19:53.959 --> 19:59.906
somewhat more elaboration. And then they'll go 
through the whole series of the divine principle

20:00.566 --> 20:06.933
to greater or lesser detail, depending on the 
situation and the lecturer. And at the end of that,

20:07.914 --> 20:16.924
the people who are interested, the lectures are 
set up in such a way that they have real emotional

20:07.914 --> 20:16.924
impact. psychological hooks.

20:22.810 --> 20:28.098
Anyway, at the end of the weekend lecture series, 
and they'll invite them to go to a week-long

20:22.810 --> 20:28.098
lecture series. And the people who go to the 
week-long lecture series, it's a pretty high

20:28.679 --> 20:35.529
percentage of people joining. And some people 
even join after a weekend. But the people who go to

20:38.293 --> 20:39.234
the... If you can get them away from their home for a 
week to work together and to sing together and, you

20:39.254 --> 20:49.189
know, the very intense... working on people on a 
one-to-one basis with a great deal of love and

20:49.169 --> 20:53.936
personal interest. So it's pretty effective. I 
should talk a little about the way the lecture

20:59.825 --> 21:16.830
series is structured because the ideas in and of 
themselves, I think again, seem probably rather

20:59.825 --> 21:16.830
innocuous and a little bit all kind of quirky and 
funny, but certainly not malignant. The thing is,

21:17.873 --> 21:28.024
is that the way the lecture series is delivered and 
organized, it makes people feel personal

21:17.873 --> 21:28.024
responsibility. It's designed to make people 
feel personal responsibility for the state of the

21:28.044 --> 21:31.848
world. The first lecture is one that, as I said, 
talks about the ideal world, the ideal family that

21:32.769 --> 21:44.202
got it intended

21:32.769 --> 21:44.202
in the beginning. And the second lecture speaks 
about the fall of man, which is identified as

21:45.582 --> 22:10.847
being, and with some rather interesting proof 
texting and rather convoluted reasoning,

21:45.582 --> 22:10.847
identifies the fall of man as essentially being a 
physical relationship or spiritual

21:45.582 --> 22:10.847
relationship, in any event a sexual one, which was 
premature. And since it was premature before the

22:12.785 --> 22:24.149
individuals had fully developed on an individual 
basis, they established a dependency which

22:12.785 --> 22:24.149
should not have existed for ideal love. It was a 
needing neurotic kind of love that they became

22:24.670 --> 22:32.667
involved in. And because of that, they say, then 
true parents, perfect parents who can give love

22:32.647 --> 22:58.103
unconditionally never developed because the 
children born out of that first

22:32.647 --> 22:58.103
experience were never given that kind of love 
themselves. So there was this endless cycle of...

23:03.899 --> 23:10.571
Parents who didn't know fully how to love giving 
birth to children who also didn't learn it. And the

23:10.591 --> 23:23.393
thing that this does is that it plugs into 
everyone's own anxieties and feelings of guilt

23:10.591 --> 23:23.393
about desires for premarital sex. which is a big 
guilt thing in our society. And as the lecture

23:28.703 --> 23:42.124
series goes on, they talk about how the Jews failed 
to unite with Christ, and a lot of the ideas of the

23:28.703 --> 23:42.124
Christology are very strange, and they lose a lot 
of Christians there. And some of the lecturers

23:43.420 --> 23:47.747
really soft-pedal a lot of that stuff. But when 
they start talking about history, they talk about

23:49.530 --> 24:08.382
cycles in history, and they begin using some very 
interesting numbers drawn from the Bible without

23:49.530 --> 24:08.382
even maintaining that these are actually 
factually true, but rather that they're

23:49.530 --> 24:08.382
symbolically important, and that's the reason 
they're in the Bible. start setting up parallels

24:08.362 --> 24:18.083
between the coming of Christ and what you discover 
much later to be the coming of some man at the

24:08.362 --> 24:18.083
beginning of this century. And some of the 
similarities which had been noted by historians

24:19.146 --> 24:27.163
before between the history of the Christian 
church and the history of the Jewish people are

24:19.146 --> 24:27.163
very striking. 40-year periods, 300-year 
periods, and that sort of thing.

24:36.117 --> 24:42.927
The papal captivity in Avignon, or the banishment 
to Avignon, is sometimes referred to as the

24:36.117 --> 24:42.927
Babylonian captivity, and that sort of thing. And 
some very interesting parallels. Probably the

24:46.292 --> 24:50.198
most striking part of the lecture series, as far as 
I was concerned. And what this does is that by

24:50.178 --> 25:06.032
saying that in this century we have a chance that 
mankind hasn't had for 2,000 years to make changes

24:50.178 --> 25:06.032
and to do things, and we've been brought to this 
point because you're a person who's been selected

24:50.178 --> 25:06.032
by God to participate in this process. And you have 
gifts and things that mankind needs. That message

25:10.677 --> 25:14.820
is put however explicitly it is present. It's very 
powerful. It's very attractive and also very

25:17.583 --> 25:21.497
manipulative. The church has no qualms about 
having individual members They push having

25:28.197 --> 25:46.231
individual members develop as strong a 
relationship as possible with the prospective

25:28.197 --> 25:46.231
converts, exhibiting a great deal of interest in 
them personally, listening for long hours to them

25:28.197 --> 25:46.231
talk about themselves if necessary, or do 
whatever is necessary. But in general, just try to

25:46.592 --> 25:50.880
make them feel loved, make them feel wanted. And 
they want to. It's a natural kind of thing. It's

25:54.048 --> 25:58.795
manipulative, yes, but it's also sincere.

26:01.118 --> 26:10.471
Anyway, by doing that, they often engender a lot of 
these chapter two feelings, as they talk about,

26:01.118 --> 26:10.471
that is to say, feelings of physical attraction. 
And then those feelings are engendered, and then

26:11.372 --> 26:16.058
the person is made to feel guilty about those 
feelings. And it's another example. And the

26:20.366 --> 26:25.436
fallen nature for the church is expressed in two 
ways. One, in being physically attracted to a

26:27.901 --> 26:32.791
person of the opposite sex or the same sex as a man. 
Or in insubordination. So those two... human

26:40.338 --> 26:54.178
tendencies are the ones that get to be the target of 
a lot of

26:40.338 --> 26:54.178
very negative feelings and a lot of negative 
discussion.

26:59.018 --> 27:06.019
Were you encouraged to confess all these guilty 
feelings to another member? Yeah, definitely. As

27:07.624 --> 27:10.733
I mentioned before, each member has his or her own 
personal leader, they pattern all the

27:12.012 --> 27:21.087
relationships on the relationship of Cain and 
Abel. That's not to say that they're supposed to

27:21.127 --> 27:29.461
kill each other, but rather they examine the story 
of Cain and Abel for what the problems were. And the

27:30.022 --> 27:33.227
thing was is that they...

27:34.861 --> 27:39.766
believe that Abel was in a position of being closer 
to God because of reversals caused by the Fallen.

27:39.906 --> 27:44.691
There's no sense going into all this theology, but 
in any event, that's sort of the source of the

27:39.906 --> 27:44.691
story. And that Cain was responsible to overcome 
his own feelings of superiority, more

27:45.712 --> 28:04.530
experience, being in the firstborn position, 
overcome all of those natural jealous feelings,

27:45.712 --> 28:04.530
and feeling like he was more qualified, all that 
sort of stuff, and accept Abel's leadership. and

28:04.510 --> 28:06.954
thereby become close to God. And so, all 
relationships are established on that basis, and

28:07.815 --> 28:17.449
that the person who is the leader is in the able 
position, and the person who is the follower is in

28:07.815 --> 28:17.449
the keen position. Now, this gets... There's a 
great deal of very convoluted discussion

28:21.475 --> 28:32.391
and...

28:34.328 --> 28:39.695
Well, Moon will at different times say, you don't 
know who's in the Cain position. You don't know

28:39.715 --> 28:41.016
who's in the evil position. Both must act as though 
they are Cain to try to help overcome some of the

28:41.096 --> 28:53.372
natural inequities that come about, as you can 
imagine, in those kinds of situations where one

28:41.096 --> 28:53.372
person is kind of established as being closer to 
God than the other. The potential for

28:54.894 --> 29:02.563
some pretty ridiculous overcompensation is 
observed sometimes in the church. But

29:10.793 --> 29:24.569
since you have an individual who is in that 
position between you and God, then you are

29:10.793 --> 29:24.569
encouraged to confess to them, to tell them all of 
your feelings, to tell them about your past, about

29:10.793 --> 29:24.569
the things you've done wrong. This gives them a 
great deal of power over you. And that is also

29:27.612 --> 29:32.618
passed on to their immediate able, that sort of 
thing, on and on.

29:35.450 --> 29:39.934
The initial doubts that you described about the 
group, how were those overcome? And was it a long

29:40.194 --> 29:42.597
process? I don't

29:42.617 --> 30:02.655
think they were really...

29:42.617 --> 30:02.655
Those doubts were feelings as much as ideas. I

30:04.002 --> 30:17.563
would

30:04.002 --> 30:17.563
say that in terms of the ideas being overcome, that 
was mostly a matter of choice. And that choice was

30:17.623 --> 30:21.429
motivated by my emotional commitment to the 
people. Is that if these people are what they say

30:21.449 --> 30:30.162
they are and this is what this is, then I need to just 
simply buckle down and accept this and learn to

30:21.449 --> 30:30.162
understand it. And that's really the approach 
that the church takes, that doubts and those sorts

30:30.142 --> 30:40.578
of things are evidence of individual guilt, 
guiltiness, sin. And so one, in the first place,

30:41.860 --> 30:48.049
doesn't want to admit it because it's evidence of 
one's own shortcomings. And when one does, it's

30:48.029 --> 30:51.917
the process of overcoming it. In terms of the 
feelings of doubt and stuff, sort of the same

30:53.801 --> 31:00.134
thing. It was sort of a choice to do that. Although, 
as I said, the choice was essentially a

31:02.219 --> 31:07.590
manipulated choice. I was deciding on the basis of 
how wonderful these people were and how wonderful

31:07.570 --> 31:17.932
they were to me, which I thought was evidence of 
this being the right thing. And didn't realize

31:18.193 --> 31:26.811
that there was a structure that had been...

31:26.791 --> 31:33.100
designed to do that very thing, to attract people 
and get them involved. But those were still in

31:34.041 --> 31:50.605
place when it came to the time that I was confronted 
with the breakdown of the day-to-day structure

31:34.041 --> 31:50.605
that was so important in keeping people in the 
group, the enforced ritual of of early rising and

31:50.585 --> 31:55.674
meals, work, all that stuff that kept you very 
busy. When I was confronted with the breakdown of

31:56.736 --> 32:07.935
that, with the incredible pain that my family had 
gone through because of this, those doubts were

31:56.736 --> 32:07.935
still fresh in my mind. Now that's not to say that I 
was in the process of doubting the church at that

32:07.915 --> 32:12.405
time. I wasn't. But I still remembered those 
feelings and those thoughts that I had. And I could

32:16.413 --> 32:19.280
understand how people could feel that way about 
the church. I could understand positions opposed

32:19.300 --> 32:22.887
to the church very well. And essentially for me, 
leaving the church was a process... of realizing

32:28.756 --> 32:33.027
that my commitment was a manipulated commitment. 
And so my break with the church came on the basis of

32:33.047 --> 32:44.537
realizing that I did not have an authentic 
commitment to the church at all, but rather one

32:33.047 --> 32:44.537
that was based on... That's Pastor Clark. That's a 
fast clock. Paul, you need to be quiet because this

32:46.280 --> 32:52.109
machine is taping everything you're saying. My 
commitment was a, as I said, a manipulated one and

32:52.130 --> 33:00.884
not one that I had chosen on the basis of this being 
the best idea. And the anger that I experienced at

33:01.785 --> 33:09.478
realizing that I had been manipulated and been 
used rather than making the choice and committing

33:10.420 --> 33:14.764
myself to it. The anger that I felt was the thing 
that really freed me from that control. And once I

33:20.149 --> 33:26.434
realized that, I knew what all the problems of the 
church were. Some former members describe a loss

33:26.454 --> 33:32.840
of ability to think rationally during the 
introduction period. Would you use that

33:33.521 --> 33:38.605
description concerning yourself?

33:40.492 --> 33:48.286
Yeah, I would say, as I said, the introduction 
period was not an intensive weekend for me like it

33:40.492 --> 33:48.286
was for other people. What was happening to me at 
that time was that I was at a point of tremendous

33:48.306 --> 34:03.833
flux in my own personal life, which made me more 
liable to make choices on the basis of what felt

33:48.306 --> 34:03.833
good and what felt right. And the thing is, is that I 
think as growing up as a Christian, I had always,

34:03.931 --> 34:14.326
you know, you're taught to look for the gifts of the 
Spirit and long-sufferingness and love and that

34:03.931 --> 34:14.326
sort of thing. And I wasn't finding that in my 
friends. I'll be very frank about that. The

34:18.792 --> 34:22.077
relationships that I had at that time were not 
terribly satisfying. And I think that becoming an

34:22.097 --> 34:28.065
adult, whether one is involved in the church, that 
is, the Christian church or whatever, or not, is a

34:28.045 --> 34:36.814
process of learning how to develop good, solid, 
loving relationships, which is not easy. Because

34:36.834 --> 34:44.703
when it is done by both members choosing to do it and 
choosing to make a commitment, it's very

34:36.834 --> 34:44.703
difficult. The thing that happens with the church 
is that the individuals involved with

34:44.723 --> 34:54.053
proselytizing know that that kind of love and 
affection is what everybody needs and what

34:55.180 --> 34:59.408
everybody's looking for. And so they're willing 
to give it to you in triple doses during that

34:59.428 --> 35:09.848
introductory period and that indoctrination 
period, but they can't afford to keep giving it

34:59.428 --> 35:09.848
afterwards. So you get lots of lumps of brown sugar 
during the indoctrination period. And

35:18.914 --> 35:27.533
essentially, that's what you're looking for is 
evidence that these are good people and that this

35:18.914 --> 35:27.533
is a good thing to become involved with. But those 
lumps of brown sugar don't continue to come after

35:27.513 --> 35:30.760
you join. You have to work harder and harder to get 
them. So yeah, I think a loss of the ability, a loss

35:35.611 --> 35:39.921
of the desire and the need for it. You know, when 
you're experiencing the kind of love and

35:40.422 --> 35:47.277
attention that you've always wanted and really 
haven't had since you were a child. then rational

35:47.257 --> 35:51.864
evidence is much less important. And I think 
anybody who's really familiar with human nature

35:52.325 --> 35:57.793
and with people and working with people knows that 
that's the case. It's just that we try to be honest

35:58.715 --> 36:02.921
with each other as well as loving. And that's the 
thing that the Church does not do at all. They're

36:06.186 --> 36:10.112
very conscious of extreme levels of deception. 
They call it heavenly deception and they deny that

36:11.114 --> 36:13.678
that exists. Of course they deny it exists.

36:19.100 --> 36:30.826
But, yeah, at the time that if somebody asked them 
if Sun Myung Moon is the Messiah, they may be honest

36:19.100 --> 36:30.826
enough to say, well, what do you think? But for them 
to come out and say yes would be against the tenets

36:30.846 --> 36:36.619
of the Church, even though that's exactly what 
they believe. So I guess in the long run, yes, the

36:38.506 --> 36:45.501
answer is yes, that you do experience a loss of 
ability to think rationally. Or what I would say

36:45.541 --> 36:56.464
is, more than that, loss of the ability to make 
choices based on rationality, because you're

36:45.541 --> 36:56.464
getting this overload of... of emotional 
information that I think makes it very difficult

36:56.444 --> 37:05.673
to say, well, you know, these are really great 
people, maybe the most loving people I've ever

36:56.444 --> 37:05.673
met. They obviously love each other very much. 
It's a great organization. A real paradigm of what

37:09.076 --> 37:14.361
relationships should be like. But I think their 
theology is a mess, so I'm not going to be involved.

37:18.125 --> 37:20.427
That's not the way you decide. There's a place 
in... one of Jesus' prayers that's recorded,

37:24.035 --> 37:28.358
where it talks about... You know, I pray that these 
people would love each other so that the world may

37:29.823 --> 37:34.169
know that I am Christ. And I think that's what we 
look for. We look for love between individuals.

37:38.614 --> 37:45.523
And as Christians, we certainly look for love 
within the church as evidence that Christ is alive

37:38.614 --> 37:45.523
and working among us. And so when you see that 
happen, it's hard to say, boy, theology sure is a

37:46.565 --> 37:52.172
mess. I don't think this is real. Because you don't 
realize it's not real.

37:58.949 --> 38:06.737
In your opinion then, did you identify more with 
Moon and his Divine Principle, or with the group

37:58.949 --> 38:06.737
and the communal living? Oh, definitely the 
latter. The identification with Moon was

38:09.339 --> 38:13.283
predicated on everything else. Although, he is a 
very charismatic individual, and when I first

38:13.723 --> 38:28.618
observed him, it confirmed a lot of things for me, 
in the sense that I remember the sense of every

38:13.723 --> 38:28.618
motion that he made being very definite. He's one 
of these people who walks through a room and you

38:31.028 --> 38:33.871
notice him. He's aggressive in a sense, but not 
aggressive in an angular, jerky way. He's just

38:41.919 --> 38:42.980
very deliberate. And a real natural leader. 
There's no doubt about it. Tremendous

38:46.804 --> 38:49.907
charismatic personality. And also capable of 
exhibiting

38:56.493 --> 39:02.562
human concern, although you don't know whether 
that's by choice or by nature. And it doesn't

39:02.942 --> 39:04.224
really matter. It has the same effect either way.

39:08.510 --> 39:18.224
How do the group dynamics of the Unification 
Church differ from other groups in society?

39:19.166 --> 39:21.589
Well...

39:24.067 --> 39:31.596
My first inclination is to say there's no 
comparison.

39:33.247 --> 39:38.655
There's no place in society outside of possibly 
the army. But even in the army, there is always a

39:38.695 --> 39:43.723
sense that you're going to be out in two years. Or if 
it really came down to it, this leader could be

39:44.704 --> 39:52.717
subject to court martial or something like that. 
There is never a sense in the church that there is

39:52.757 --> 40:00.148
any recourse beyond that immediate leader.

40:04.212 --> 40:10.779
With the army, you know that you have, there's a 
certain set of rules by which everybody lives. And

40:10.819 --> 40:13.802
I suppose in the church there's an element of that 
too. But really when it comes down to the

40:14.503 --> 40:26.135
one-to-one level, the person who is the immediate 
leader has a great deal of authority over the

40:14.503 --> 40:26.135
individual member. Thank you. Everything about 
one's life, one is responsible to share with one's

40:28.478 --> 40:35.186
able. One's dreams, one's fantasies. Moon 
determines who you're going to marry. The church

40:42.975 --> 40:50.183
administration decides primarily what kind of 
work you're going to be involved with.

40:52.559 --> 41:02.218
I experienced times in the church where

40:52.559 --> 41:02.218
we essentially were told to give up all of our 
personal possessions. I was told to give away all

41:02.779 --> 41:11.496
of my clothes and only wear clothes that had been 
given to me by other members. I was told to cut my

41:11.476 --> 41:17.586
hair and shave my beard when I first joined, and I 
did it basically without question. But realizing

41:17.606 --> 41:24.318
that this becoming like a child, in a sense, was the 
ideal. And this ideal of becoming like a child in

41:28.705 --> 41:37.245
accepting unquestionably

41:28.705 --> 41:37.245
any directive which comes to you is a real ideal 
within the church. Now, of course, that breaks

41:37.306 --> 41:39.611
down sometimes. But it is...

41:46.289 --> 41:48.753
an extreme level of commitment. And it's not just 
the people who decide to become monks or become

41:48.773 --> 41:52.740
priests. It's every individual. The lack of 
personal space is, I think, an extreme one. While

42:01.194 --> 42:03.117
in many religious orders one is encouraged to have 
a personal meditative life and things like that in

42:04.700 --> 42:33.913
the church you're encouraged to have personal 
prayers and stuff like that you're told about how

42:04.700 --> 42:33.913
they're supposed to be and

42:04.700 --> 42:33.913
hardly given enough time to do it on top of that it's 
really it's extremely intense and i think that

42:04.700 --> 42:33.913
it's possible i was reading in one book that talked 
about thought reform in China, by Robert Lifton,

42:36.104 --> 42:53.843
Thought Reform and Psychology of Totalism, I 
think, how it is possible with certain

42:36.104 --> 42:53.843
individuals to have tremendous periods of 
personal growth within that kind of intensity of

42:54.937 --> 42:58.242
environment. And some people do actually opt for 
that. You know, monasticism is that kind of a

43:00.125 --> 43:02.389
tradition. The thing that happens with the 
Unification Church is that rather than taking a

43:03.070 --> 43:15.730
long time to prepare and everybody trying to 
discourage you and make sure that this is exactly

43:03.070 --> 43:15.730
what you want to do and you know what you're getting 
yourself into, They deliberately prevent you

43:15.710 --> 43:27.633
from finding what you're into, but by the use of 
emotional pressure, try to persuade you to get

43:15.710 --> 43:27.633
into it and make you feel guilty for trying to get 
out. So the manipulation happens at an extremely

43:28.675 --> 43:34.225
personal level, the most personal level as 
possible. I felt horrible guilt about having wet

43:35.015 --> 43:39.822
dreams. And, well, the sexual repression in the 
group was extreme. And for a young man 19 years old,

43:43.807 --> 43:49.135
something's just going to happen. That's all 
there is to it. But I felt tremendous guilt because

43:50.717 --> 43:55.183
I thought that this was... spiritual sexual 
experiences you know this is the fall all over

43:55.163 --> 44:25.170
again and here I am in the midst of God's you know 
wonderful family and how can this be happening and

43:55.163 --> 44:25.170
that sort of thing so if it were on the basis of 
people knowing exactly what they were getting

43:55.163 --> 44:25.170
into being counseled and time being taken to find 
out whether this is something they really wanted

43:55.163 --> 44:25.170
to do and commit themselves to or not it would be one 
thing but to be deceived um in such a wholesale way

44:25.150 --> 44:36.161
as one is during the indoctrination process, 
during the introductory and proselytizing

44:25.150 --> 44:36.161
stages. I hesitate to use the word proselytize 
because I don't think it's really a

44:36.321 --> 44:40.806
proselytization process. It's really a matter of 
being manipulated. It's like

44:45.371 --> 44:51.597
people trying to take money away from elderly 
people by offering them love and affection and

44:52.505 --> 44:57.451
that sort of stuff. It's much more similar to that 
than it is any other kind of process. So that gets a

45:02.176 --> 45:05.199
little away from your question, I suppose. But 
it's not really similar in terms of group process

45:05.900 --> 45:11.806
at all. There's no democracy of choice. There's no 
group decision making of any kind. All of it is

45:19.715 --> 45:21.297
authoritarian. So, very little similarity.
