WEBVTT

00:06.595 --> 00:08.578
Okay, we can continue. The Southern Education 
Board was a forerunner of many regional boards

00:08.598 --> 00:31.449
which made provisions for students in states that 
had no veterinary school to attend veterinary

00:08.598 --> 00:31.449
school in nearby states. For example, the 
Southern School took care of Most of the students

00:36.818 --> 00:44.850
in the South, they could either go to Georgia, 
Alabama, or Texas, depending on which was the

00:36.818 --> 00:44.850
nearest. The Western schools included Colorado 
and Washington and so forth. The Northern schools

00:51.820 --> 01:05.880
mostly were in, I mean, the North Central schools 
primarily went to Iowa

01:06.957 --> 01:09.220
Northeastern schools to Cornell.

01:12.865 --> 01:22.718
Even this didn't take care of the students, so many 
states made provision for veterinary schools

01:12.865 --> 01:22.718
their own. For example, Minnesota,

01:23.900 --> 01:35.175
Virginia, Louisiana, Mississippi, California, 
Oh, I don't know. I can't call them all, but all

01:36.182 --> 01:38.826
those... California Davis? Yes. All those fuels 
came in after World War II.

01:45.235 --> 01:52.226
So the curriculum was pretty well standardized, 
and you had to have so many hours, you can get that in

01:45.235 --> 01:52.226
the catalog. But that's pretty well 
standardized, regardless of what fuel you go to in

01:52.766 --> 01:57.713
the United States. There may be a little 
variation, for example, in the number of hours

01:58.555 --> 02:02.901
traded, or due to the Location that may be more 
emphasis like we have more emphasis on Ferris dog

02:03.067 --> 02:22.374
in Texas than they do on in Minnesota, for example, 
while they have Maybe One on the disease of

02:03.067 --> 02:22.374
fur-bearing animals, which it's a little 
consequence here. Yes, but all in all the

02:22.554 --> 02:29.884
curriculum was first established by the National 
Defense Act of 1920 and when it set out the

02:30.640 --> 02:43.072
requirements for a veterinarian that was

02:30.640 --> 02:43.072
entitled to or competent to be employed by the 
federal government. And during the Depression

02:43.092 --> 02:58.707
years, this was particularly important because

02:43.092 --> 02:58.707
many veterinarians left their practice to seek 
government work in order to make ends meet.

03:03.108 --> 03:07.994
Now, I have a question concerning the increasing 
number of pre-professional college work. In

03:09.175 --> 03:18.026
1975, or after the Second World War, you had to have 
basically two hours or two years of

03:09.175 --> 03:18.026
pre-professional. And in 1975 at Texas A&M, it was 
increased to 66 hours. Today, do you need a BS

03:26.076 --> 03:31.603
degree officially to gain entrance into Texas 
A&M? I don't know. okay I retired 10 years ago yeah

03:32.757 --> 04:00.553
11 years ago I really don't know and the basic and 
could you and the basic reason as I understand for

03:32.757 --> 04:00.553
an increase in in the number of hours before you get 
into vet school is to make better vet students and

03:32.757 --> 04:00.553
because the competition was too high are those the 
two reasons well and and to get everything

03:32.757 --> 04:00.553
possible out of the veterinary college proper 
that could be taught in other places. In other

04:04.882 --> 04:13.372
words, like English, or physics, or entomology, 
or chemistry, or biological chemistry. There's

04:13.592 --> 04:23.343
many things like that that can be better taught in 
their own, by their own factors than by a

04:13.592 --> 04:23.343
veterinarian. DAVID BURRAGE. Sure, absolutely. 
OK, now another thing that you mentioned that

04:25.441 --> 04:41.938
stimulated me was that before World War II and even 
before the 1960s, as a matter of fact, more out of

04:25.441 --> 04:41.938
state were applying to Texas A&M. And we briefly 
talked about this last time. I was wondering what

04:44.801 --> 04:52.208
effect it had, what effect these out of state 
students had on Texas A&M. well of course it had it

04:53.065 --> 05:18.837
had two effects first it it crowded out many 
potential texas students

04:53.065 --> 05:18.837
and the second it just overburdened the 
facilities right but with the regional boards

04:53.065 --> 05:18.837
like for example southern board uh

05:22.259 --> 05:25.102
let nine or 12 Louisiana students come in. Those 
were picked students, picked by Louisiana, not by

05:25.302 --> 05:41.401
Texas A&M, but sent over under the covering of the 
National Education Board, or Southern Regional,

05:25.302 --> 05:41.401
I believe they called it. But since they were 
picked students, they were no dummies. Yeah, they

05:45.245 --> 05:46.246
were top notch. They were top notch, and that 
raised the IQ quite a bit. and it raised the

05:52.111 --> 05:55.174
competition. Sure, for Texans too. Sure, because 
there were nine places that, or 12 places that were

05:56.635 --> 06:21.477
set aside for Louisiana, there were 12 places 
Texas couldn't get, and then when they let the

05:56.635 --> 06:21.477
girls in, that really put the big pot in the little 
one, because those girls were and are top

05:56.635 --> 06:21.477
students, and so Competition is, again, keen. So 
it really comes down to the fact when you take the

06:28.211 --> 06:47.468
top number of students, when you take in 128 and you 
have 500 applications, you have a pretty

06:28.211 --> 06:47.468
competitive deal. In fact, it's even more 
competitive than it is to get into medical school,

06:47.528 --> 06:53.033
quite a bit. Now the first woman was admitted as a 
student here in 1963 and now they comprise about

06:53.148 --> 07:10.504
one-third of the student body and I was wondering 
if there was any resistance from the faculty

06:53.148 --> 07:10.504
members when the first women came? They might have 
been a little temporary resistance but there's

07:11.385 --> 07:14.948
none now. In fact the girls are, the women I should 
say, are university good students and we've

07:24.518 --> 07:33.066
progressed sufficiently far now that we have 
several women faculty members. I noticed that.

07:34.247 --> 07:50.341
Particularly in anatomy and bacteriology and 
virology and

07:34.247 --> 07:50.341
various disciplines that don't really cause them 
to be cowboys. Right. Now do you know how it came

07:52.632 --> 07:58.921
about that women were first admitted? Well, yes. 
Could you explain? Well, I can't explain but I can

08:02.506 --> 08:05.771
tell you Mr. Rudder decided they were going to come 
in and they did.

08:11.118 --> 08:11.919
In other words, it was... It was the handwriting on 
the wall. It's like the CRA and women's rights and

08:13.602 --> 08:17.948
everything. regardless of what you say, you 
couldn't run Texas A&M without federal money. And

08:25.198 --> 08:39.212
women are citizens, and the daughters and even the 
wives of some of the veterinarians wanted to take

08:25.198 --> 08:39.212
veterinary medicine. If they were qualified, 
why, what could you do? And so it was just, it was

08:43.736 --> 08:48.441
just a part of the coming of age or the realization 
that a woman is a citizen. For example, Dr.

08:56.363 --> 09:11.156
Dorothea Robin out here at College Station, her 
husband was a professor, well actually he was an

08:56.363 --> 09:11.156
instructor then, in the Department of Pathology. 
She was graduating University of Texas in

09:11.196 --> 09:18.242
biology, so she applied, she got her degree, Since 
then, there have been quite a few male

09:19.252 --> 09:32.604
veterinarians, married women veterinarians, 
who set up a joint practice.

09:32.624 --> 09:35.987
And quite a few of those role matches started in the 
veterinary school. I would think so. And to

09:36.848 --> 09:47.217
present time, I think, I'm not, you'll have to 
check with Dr. Shelton or Dr. Bay on this, but I

09:36.848 --> 09:47.217
think there's about 25% of the total enrollment in 
the school of veterinary medicine are women.

09:47.534 --> 09:49.717
Right today, there's about one-third. Is that 
right? Well, anyway, they're almost unbearably

09:51.760 --> 09:59.231
good students and they rarely see one drop out 
because it's scholastic.

10:01.794 --> 10:06.161
In other words, it was basically Mr. Rutter's 
decision that brought this about. There wasn't

10:06.181 --> 10:12.630
any input from the doctors of veterinary medicine 
who were teaching? Well, who makes those

10:14.365 --> 10:16.368
decisions? I don't know. I was just like you. I just 
worked there. Right, right. I know, I know. All I

10:24.279 --> 10:26.141
know, it came in during Mr. Rudder's regime, and 
most of the other schools in the United States

10:26.182 --> 10:39.600
didn't have the male-only image of Texas A&M, so we 
were the last to get in line. In fact, there was a

10:39.620 --> 10:43.005
girl who graduated a year ahead of me at Kansas 
State, 1932 and another graduated a year

10:43.593 --> 10:50.842
following me in 1934 even though they were not in my 
class of 33. I see.

10:55.067 --> 10:59.112
But who did I don't know all I know what happened 
during Mr. Rudder's regime. Okay fine uh now did

11:01.074 --> 11:13.009
this did the admittance of women as students 
produce any changes in the curriculum?

11:17.950 --> 11:25.282
No, those girls do just everything that a man does 
as far as...

11:17.950 --> 11:25.282
Mm-hmm. Did it produce any changes in student 
activities? Was there a woman's organization of

11:29.188 --> 11:32.954
veterinarians? There is a national organization 
of women veterinarians, but locally I don't know.

11:39.685 --> 11:43.131
Okay,

11:39.685 --> 11:43.131
okay. Now there's still something that interests 
me and I know last time we talked about this and last

11:44.478 --> 11:59.872
time you weren't quite sure why this was but you 
know in 1962 180 students applied for vet school

11:44.478 --> 11:59.872
and today there's over 600 students. That is the 
mystery. I was talking to my local physician about

12:03.575 --> 12:09.040
that the other day. He had a relative that had a 
wanted to be a veterinarian. And he never got in,

12:16.456 --> 12:19.580
although he applied two or three times. But he 
remarked, and he used a word, he said, hell, it's

12:21.001 --> 12:30.631
harder to get in veterinary school than it is in 
medical school. I said, yes, or law school either.

12:33.734 --> 12:34.635
But why, I don't know. Why all of a sudden everybody 
in the United States decided they wanted to be a

12:34.675 --> 12:41.282
veterinarian, I don't know. No.

12:47.353 --> 12:53.001
You'll have to ask some economist or whatnot, but I 
really don't know. Now, back in 1957 and 1958, in

12:54.022 --> 13:03.635
those years, there were approximately 240 
students total in vet school. And now it's over

13:04.035 --> 13:05.056
400. So I was wondering what impact that increase 
in students had. Well, the impact was that we were

13:12.802 --> 13:27.279
always using

13:12.802 --> 13:27.279
a dollar short and a day late. We were trying to, 
running all the time to stay in the same place.

13:35.549 --> 13:41.294
But it meant that more instructors had to be hired 
and more physical facility had to be obtained. And

13:42.115 --> 13:47.420
it's primarily why there's new clinical facility 
being built out on the highway now. But the demand

13:48.681 --> 14:01.753
has to be there before you can sell it to the power to 
be to get money for teachers

13:48.681 --> 14:01.753
and buildings and equipment. Because it comes as a 
surprise to a lot of people It's almost expensive

14:06.835 --> 14:15.403
to educate a veterinarian as an individual 
physician. Microscopes cost the same, x-ray

14:15.763 --> 14:18.806
machines cost the same. Sure.

14:22.210 --> 14:24.852
Bacteriology and virology techniques are the 
same.

14:27.675 --> 14:31.939
So we were just running like hell trying to save 
them. Trying to keep up with it, OK. Now, because

14:34.004 --> 14:41.014
there were more students, did that mean that there 
were new programs that were developed? No, it

14:41.475 --> 14:50.188
meant that,

14:41.475 --> 14:50.188
come back to the original statement, why were 
there more students? I don't know. The curriculum

14:53.493 --> 14:55.656
had been pretty well standardized. Oh, 
occasionally they put in one class or dropped out

14:55.676 --> 15:01.665
one class, but The curriculum's been pretty well 
standardized for the last 20 years. Okay. With the

15:08.387 --> 15:19.145
exception, of course, of moving things out of the 
veterinary curriculum into the pre-veterinary

15:08.387 --> 15:19.145
curriculum to make room for more clinical 
science. Okay. Now, do you think with the hiring of

15:22.230 --> 15:28.480
new instructors, do you think the quality of 
instruction change in any way? Oh, if anything,

15:29.354 --> 15:37.826
it's gone better because these new instructors, 
most of them are graduates from top graduates from

15:29.354 --> 15:37.826
schools that had just as much pressure as we do.

15:43.914 --> 15:46.838
Okay, so you think that the quality of instruction 
probably improved. Oh, yeah. Okay. Now, I was

15:47.900 --> 15:50.944
wondering about something else as far as 
instruction. Well, there's another thing I'd

15:52.226 --> 15:54.689
like to emphasize. All the instructors in the 
School of Veterinary Medicine are not

15:54.709 --> 15:58.855
veterinarians. For example, in bacteriology and 
virology and things like that, there are many

15:59.054 --> 16:06.383
PhDs. Right, right. Well, why don't we stay on that 
topic for a minute? I was going to ask you about

16:11.069 --> 16:12.891
that. We didn't, at Texas A&M, we didn't grant a 
master's degree and doctor's degree for some

16:13.852 --> 16:19.159
years. As a matter of fact, we didn't grant our 
first PhD until 1955 at Texas A&M. That's right.

16:25.947 --> 16:28.791
Look how the graduate school has grown. Mm-hmm, 
mm-hmm. I was wondering what was the stimulus?

16:33.920 --> 16:43.593
What were the reasons for now expanding your 
program from just doctors of veterinarian

16:33.920 --> 16:43.593
medicine now to PhD in veterinarian pathology or 
something? Well, I think it's primarily the

16:44.114 --> 16:49.221
demand for research and for teaching purposes. 
Okay. Because the DVM and the research

16:51.724 --> 16:57.192
laboratory, for example, National Institute of 
Health or whatnot, Needs the original, needs the

16:57.982 --> 17:08.372
additional specialization in order to hold the 
job.

17:09.554 --> 17:13.417
Research is a big deal when everything causes 
cancer that you eat. And you have to have a hundred

17:14.378 --> 17:19.884
rats on something for a hundred days. Somebody has 
to examine those rats to tell whether they're

17:19.944 --> 17:24.489
cancerous or not. So you have to have a qualified 
pathologist. or water quality, you have to have a

17:29.133 --> 17:40.544
qualified bacteriologist or biologist to 
isolate, for example, infectious hepatitis from

17:29.133 --> 17:40.544
the oysters that they drag up out of New Orleans.

17:43.707 --> 17:57.520
And then we're going into things like marine 
biology and these fish farms where people are

17:43.707 --> 17:57.520
growing catfish in a two-acre pond on their own 
land. And then, of course, there's always the fact

17:59.592 --> 18:09.828
we've had the good years when everybody had a dog 
and most people have a horse. You have a boat, and if

18:11.791 --> 18:25.712
you're really uptown, well, you have a boat and you 
put your horse in it and go down the highway with a

18:11.791 --> 18:25.712
trailer so everybody knows you're well off.

18:25.733 --> 18:27.996
But like the recent outbreak, rabies care in 
Houston and to a lesser extent here in Bryan. You

18:34.039 --> 18:41.889
have to have skilled people with the actual basic 
knowledge of how to handle things like that. I have

18:41.909 --> 18:47.776
another question concerning people with 
doctorates and advanced degrees coming to Texas

18:41.909 --> 18:47.776
A&M. In the history department some years ago 
there was a tendency that whenever you needed a new

18:48.537 --> 18:56.667
professor you just called up the University of 
Texas and They sent over a couple of their PhD

18:56.950 --> 19:10.891
candidates and you hired one and consequently we 
have a number of people on our staff that were hired

18:56.950 --> 19:10.891
before 1970 that were PhDs from Texas. Does the vet 
school or did the vet school favor a certain

19:10.911 --> 19:16.399
institution? No. Well, let me put it this way. In 
the early days, Ohio State probably got the nod

19:20.205 --> 19:24.932
because of Dr. Francis. But since 19, oh, I'd say 
1920, 25, they take the best man they can get. For

19:35.134 --> 19:49.029
example, we've had several people from the 
University of Iowa, from the University of

19:35.134 --> 19:49.029
California, I mean, Colorado, quite a few from 
Cornell,

19:35.134 --> 19:49.029
some from Georgia. For example, a man who took my 
place at the university when I retired, Dr. Bell.

19:55.355 --> 19:56.657
University of Georgia graduate. And then, like, 
since all the new schools come in, we have a lot more

19:57.357 --> 20:06.748
varieties to select from. We have people here from 
Purdue and from Missouri and from California, all

20:07.389 --> 20:16.580
of which were, those schools didn't exist back 
there. They actually only had about six or eight

20:16.600 --> 20:23.067
schools to pick from prior to 1925. There's 
another thing I was interested in with young

20:23.992 --> 20:32.905
instructors and that is the basis for tenure in the 
School of Veterinary Medicine. I can't tell you

20:32.966 --> 20:36.531
that because I really don't know. I know that 
professors usually get tenure or they don't, they

20:36.551 --> 20:47.788
wouldn't give a professorship but the others I 
don't know the number of years you have to be or No,

20:47.870 --> 20:49.492
I'm not talking about recently. I'm talking about 
when you started teaching, for example. Were you

20:53.558 --> 20:58.004
on a tenure system in the 30s and the 40s or exactly? 
Well, actually, I was in the Experiment Station

20:58.645 --> 21:03.332
the first nine years and there wasn't a tenure. 
Right, you were just a staff member. But when you

21:05.515 --> 21:14.088
switched and when new people in the 1940s and 50s 
came in exclusively to teach, were they on some

21:05.515 --> 21:14.088
sort of a tenure system? Not unless they were 
assistant professor or higher. And most of the

21:17.823 --> 21:21.187
time, I think it broke off with the associate 
professor. But I really don't know that. You'll

21:24.150 --> 21:27.374
have to ask somebody better qualified. That comes 
under academic rules and regulations.

21:34.181 --> 21:46.935
While we're talking about the fact that more PhDs 
were issued, I've noticed that the deans and the

21:34.181 --> 21:46.935
administrators invariably in the more recent 
years have held held the PhD. Has that affected,

21:48.865 --> 21:51.709
uh, quality of education? Well, I think that's 
simply, uh, what you say, window

21:51.729 --> 22:01.361
dressing. That's not the right word, but it's 
pretty hard to impress a PhD unless you have one

22:01.781 --> 22:08.850
also. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Or judge his 
qualifications. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. But it's all

22:13.055 --> 22:15.218
come back to the fact that

22:18.202 --> 22:23.247
Most of those fellows who were dean now weren't 
counting on being dean when they got to Ph.D. They

22:23.267 --> 22:28.933
were figuring they were going into research or 
teaching or something similar. Industrial

22:30.855 --> 22:33.418
research has a lot of those names. People who put 
out that Merck manual have got a lot of names.

22:41.386 --> 22:44.509
Mischart and Dohm and those kind of people. I mean, 
Merck, Sharp, and Dohm. Do these advanced degrees

22:47.243 --> 22:58.180
have any connection with an increasing amount of 
specialization in veterinary medicine? Is

22:58.240 --> 23:03.648
veterinary medicine becoming more specialized 
like so many other endeavors? In fact, we have

23:03.668 --> 23:07.754
subdivisions in the AVMA. We have the Society of 
Equine Practitioners, Association of Bovine

23:08.135 --> 23:15.546
Practitioners, Association of Swine 
Practitioners.

23:17.652 --> 23:19.534
Association of Industrial Veterinarians. Oh, 
you can go on, you can subdivide it down to, almost

23:20.175 --> 23:33.192
divide it to MDs, except we don't have any 
pediatrics yet, or gynecologists.

23:33.212 --> 23:38.539
Now there's something else I was interested in, 
and that is the Southwestern Veterinarian, the

23:33.212 --> 23:38.539
journal. Well... Do you know anything about that? 
I do. I was one of the instigators on starting it.

23:45.127 --> 23:46.309
Good. Tell me about your role, your participation 
in that. Well, the students, some of these better

23:49.618 --> 24:14.608
students that we talked about earlier, felt that 
we should have a medium by which they could write

23:49.618 --> 24:14.608
things or learn how to present research, either 
profound or less so, and some of the practitioners

24:16.225 --> 24:29.905
in the state were, most of whom were recent 
graduates, also wanted to help us. At that time,

24:31.347 --> 24:40.260
the Texas Veterinary Medical General, which is 
the official organ of the state thing, was just

24:31.347 --> 24:40.260
really a news sheet. It wasn't a general in the 
sense of word, and

24:47.461 --> 25:14.683
was also on the editorial board of that and we 
decided that we would keep the official

24:47.461 --> 25:14.683
publication simply that not try to make it a 
general in the true sense of words like for example

24:47.461 --> 25:14.683
the general the avma or what so forth first because 
of cost come out of practitioners pocket second if

24:47.461 --> 25:14.683
we had to pay for articles and things and whatnot, 
the printing and so forth. The description would

25:21.679 --> 25:29.530
be so high, which now goes as part of their dues, 
that it would have a negative effect. So they were

25:29.550 --> 25:34.297
wholeheartedly behind the Southwestern Bandai. 
And the first boy we had as editor, his name was Carl

25:35.839 --> 25:41.667
Wallace, I believe, fell to the cave.

25:45.983 --> 25:55.657
proved quite

25:45.983 --> 25:55.657
apt, and we got off to a good start. And it was 
primarily designed as a magazine for practicing

25:57.019 --> 26:07.735
veterinary. Instead of having some article there 
on the effect of some rare drug on monkeys, or how to

26:16.156 --> 26:20.861
extract the tooth from an Indian elephant. It was 
down-to-earth, everyday practice problems. And

26:26.306 --> 26:29.189
it succeeded beyond our expectations. And then, 
of course, the... In what way? In acceptance by the

26:33.253 --> 26:36.816
profession. And then inflation caught us.

26:44.323 --> 26:45.184
There was one else. And we had a little trouble 
financially.

26:52.913 --> 26:53.514
When was this? Well, the last few years. The last 
few years, OK. Because the price of paper went up.

27:02.306 --> 27:02.566
Sure. Price of printing went up. And so the price in 
general had to go up. And there's a little consumer

27:08.534 --> 27:11.899
resistance, like everything else. You don't need 
as much butter for $2 a pound if you do it.

27:15.640 --> 27:21.068
twenty-five cents, but so far it weathered the 
storm.

27:23.832 --> 27:35.068
But it was primarily started by the students, and 
the former graduates of this school have been most

27:23.832 --> 27:35.068
faithful in helping keep it up. Now what was your 
role? More advisory? Advisory. It was a student

27:38.794 --> 27:40.176
publication. Yeah, right.

27:46.724 --> 28:01.046
They were, I forget, three or five faculty members 
that served on the advisory committee together

27:46.724 --> 28:01.046
with the director of student publications.

28:01.066 --> 28:08.918
Now that we're talking about your duties and 
functions, from 1949 until 1967, you were on the

28:01.066 --> 28:08.918
library committee. 15 years. Could you tell me 
about that? Yes.

28:19.107 --> 28:27.516
It started with our move across, no it didn't, it 
started while we were still on the main campus. Dr.

28:27.956 --> 28:37.967
Ralph Dunn was dean then and we had a spare room in 
the veterinary hospital.

28:42.092 --> 28:46.296
Dr. Marksteller had a few issues of his blood horse 
Gentile journals and various trade journals. The

28:52.641 --> 29:04.978
boys used it primarily as a place to go in and smoke a 
cigarette and

28:52.641 --> 29:04.978
spend spare time between classes. So Dr. Dunn came 
up with the idea, why don't we start a library? And

29:12.789 --> 29:17.515
in order for it to be viable and functional, to not 
be in competition with Cushing Memorial, but be a

29:18.710 --> 29:27.801
part of it. So he talked to, I forget who the 
librarian was over there at that time. We were in

29:32.187 --> 29:34.129
charge of the main library. But it was agreeable. 
And

29:37.453 --> 29:48.447
we had asked each department to contribute books 
that time each department bought their own books,

29:49.338 --> 29:51.680
you see. Where'd they keep them? They kept them in 
their own individual offices. See, there wasn't

29:57.406 --> 29:59.889
any central library. In other words, in the clinic 
would be books on clinical medicine, and the

30:00.870 --> 30:11.340
pathology department would be pathology, and so 
forth. So they agreed, and it just grew, it just

30:13.662 --> 30:19.328
started to grow. our first,

30:20.371 --> 30:29.402
I can't think of her name, anyway, we got a 
professionally trained librarian.

30:32.425 --> 30:34.548
What was, pardon me, turn it off. June, what was, 
anyway, we obtained a professional medical

30:36.650 --> 30:47.543
librarian, and one who was familiar

30:51.100 --> 31:11.472
technical words and technical phrases and she got 
it off to a real good start and she was offered a

30:51.100 --> 31:11.472
better job in Houston or someplace and we brought 
in a Mrs. Kirksey, K-I-R-K-S-E.
