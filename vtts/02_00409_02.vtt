WEBVTT

00:02.039 --> 00:05.624
Everything grows here on the other side all the 
time. I visited Mexico and I really like it. I like

00:08.928 --> 00:09.649
the people. They're more down to earth. People are 
sitting like where I live now. Where do you live

00:15.658 --> 00:16.419
now? Hampton, Virginia.

00:20.705 --> 00:20.945
Uh-huh. There's no communication. You have to 
walk into a public place. And it's just like, if

00:25.111 --> 00:29.317
you're not there, you know, I'd say... I wanted to 
explain that from China, Nuevo Leon was my

00:29.337 --> 00:31.860
grandfather. China is a very interesting

00:32.127 --> 00:43.268
town. Do you know anything about the history of 
China? No, nothing. Well, here. One thing I'm not

00:58.937 --> 01:03.361
sure about is was there anybody here in Rio Grande 
City at all? Was there a town here before the

01:03.441 --> 01:07.565
revolution? Okay. When you cross over here, the 
history of this town used to be called Rancho

01:07.985 --> 01:13.510
Davis. Rancho Davis. There used to be a man named 
Davis that had a ranch. It was just a small ranch. It

01:18.194 --> 01:20.896
was just a rancho with a little hamlet with a few... 
Right. Right. That's what it is. When you crossed

01:23.379 --> 01:25.000
the 13th of Camargo here, Was there a town here? 
Yes. What was the population? How many people were

01:28.842 --> 01:31.766
there? Very few and very poor. Very poor? Very 
poor, the houses and everything. There were big

01:37.714 --> 01:41.538
houses, the rich, but the poor people... But what 
made them rich? No cattle? There was no

01:43.841 --> 01:44.783
agriculture. No, there was agriculture, yes, 
there was. And was it called Rancho Davis? Yes.

01:49.148 --> 01:51.291
When you crossed, wasn't it called Rio Grande? I 
don't remember. There's another name that he had.

01:56.850 --> 02:02.899
What was the name of the other man that had the 
violence? Baby Davis. No, I can't remember. It's

02:07.386 --> 02:07.907
recorded. I've seen it written. But I don't know 
which one was first, that one, and then this man

02:11.833 --> 02:18.964
named Davis. This is a very old time. But as far as 
having any real population of any size, it didn't

02:21.224 --> 02:28.751
until Camargo moved over here. Before you crossed 
Camargo, there was a few people here, but not so

02:28.771 --> 02:36.559
many people until Camargo came. Yes, almost all 
the big houses that are still there, and some that

02:37.319 --> 02:44.026
have fallen already, the families were no longer 
here. No? No. Only the houses alone? Only the

02:47.549 --> 02:48.430
houses alone. Why is this town called Rio Grande 
City and not Camargo Nuevo? A minister said, it's

02:55.504 --> 03:01.956
not Rio, it's not Grande, it's not anything. And 
then it's called Rio Grande. The important thing

03:03.538 --> 03:05.923
is that they put it, but what was it called? It was 
called Rancho Davis and it was called Rio Grande

03:05.943 --> 03:08.848
when they put it. I don't remember. I don't 
remember very well. Because I received letters

03:13.109 --> 03:17.818
from here, from friends, from here to there. I 
think it was... The question that you are

03:18.519 --> 03:20.202
asking... Yes, I'm going to say it. I think it was 
called this. After we came here, they put rivers.

03:26.193 --> 03:27.535
The Rio Grande. But how did they put camales? But 
Camargo was there. Camargo again? Yes. All of

03:31.896 --> 03:33.497
Camargo is coming here? All of Camargo, but no, no, 
no. You know that they were here because of them,

03:35.320 --> 03:43.909
they couldn't let them go, they couldn't let them 
go, they were here because of them. All the people

03:43.929 --> 03:47.614
who crossed from Camargo thought of coming back. 
We all thought of going if we didn't want to stay.

03:50.097 --> 03:58.326
But the circumstances and the law of the parents, 
what the parents say, well, I wanted to join. See,

03:58.677 --> 04:11.994
all her brothers, not all her brothers, but her two 
brothers and her sister, he came very wealthy

03:58.677 --> 04:11.994
today and he became a very good businessman. So 
there's no way that we go back and leave. They

04:15.739 --> 04:23.149
started with the meat market. Well, what's the, 
what's the name of the place? It's called Pum, Pum,

04:26.296 --> 04:28.640
Pum, and that's one of her brothers. And the other 
brother, what's his name? The other brother's

04:31.063 --> 04:33.487
name is Suspirio. Suspirio. Suspirio. And they 
own, they own the house. They started with

04:36.832 --> 04:40.217
Marqueta, but now they're Tiendas y Marqueta. 
Yes. Yes, but the brothers of the mother, of the

04:41.078 --> 04:45.304
mother's, what, they were also marketers, right? 
Yes, my grandfather was also a marketer. Your

04:47.527 --> 04:48.449
grandfather was also a marketer. My grandfather 
was also a marketer. Yes, there were. Yes, there

04:53.639 --> 04:55.943
were. Yes, there were. Yes, there were. Yes, there 
were. Yes, there were. Yes, there were. Yes, there

05:08.781 --> 05:10.884
were. Yes, there were. Yes, there

05:12.406 --> 05:16.693
were. Yes, there were. And my uncle Rafael, the 
eldest son of my father, is a marketer. And the

05:24.565 --> 05:28.831
boys, my uncle Rafael's children, are marketeers 
in Camargo. It's like an inheritance, I say. And my

05:31.915 --> 05:34.078
brothers also worked as marketeers. They all 
worked in the service, they were workers. Two

05:39.446 --> 05:41.088
brothers, Martínez. And I have three careers 
left. They are the ones I have now. What was your

05:47.156 --> 05:49.079
father's or your brother's father? Or what was 
your father's father? He used to work in that ranch

05:51.773 --> 05:58.704
called the surf system. In Spanish they call it 
peones. He used to work as a peon and he came here to

06:01.007 --> 06:07.798
the north of Mexico. What was his name? Wasn't it 
his father? It was his grandfather. My

06:13.226 --> 06:14.929
grandfather was the one who came. He was the one who 
ran away from China. He was a peon. He was a peon. In

06:20.444 --> 06:22.448
China? The

06:22.608 --> 06:36.175
reserve

06:22.608 --> 06:36.175
system, you know, we never advance. So basically 
what happened is that he was a peon, an hacienda or

06:36.593 --> 06:48.468
something near China and got away from that and 
came up here to Camargo where he had a chance to do

06:36.593 --> 06:48.468
something on his own. The old people were very bad, 
how can I say, bosses. They would take a boy to work

06:54.816 --> 07:01.885
at the ranch for 8 or 10 years and they wouldn't let 
him leave his family or anything. They would kill

07:01.905 --> 07:02.886
him. They were very hard. Yes, the bosses from the 
past. But your father didn't have a boss. No, he had

07:10.927 --> 07:14.752
people working. He didn't work, he had people. Ah, 
he was a boss. That was your father, right? My

07:23.963 --> 07:26.206
father, yes. We never worked outside. We, young 
women, big, from Martínez, She taught me how to

07:32.821 --> 07:43.562
sew, how to embroider, how to crochet, how to do a 
lot of things with my hands. That was my job as a

07:43.582 --> 07:48.552
seamstress.

07:52.109 --> 07:55.332
to make things like that to put on the tables and 
then they used it. Now they put it on the floor. It is

07:57.334 --> 08:02.540
the custom in many places for the ladies to do many 
things. Yes, sewing. Yes. And they say that I am

08:04.222 --> 08:07.685
cheap for clothes. Well, yes, because I knew how to 
do it. I can't do them well. I know a lot about life.

08:20.659 --> 08:21.880
Who founded Camargo? Because you lived there, 
right? When you were born in Camargo, what

08:26.136 --> 08:30.422
inspired you to go to that city? Why is it called 
Camargo? You were called Camargo because of

08:31.884 --> 08:34.608
General Camargo, right? Maybe that's what they 
say. There's a general, a famous Mexican general

08:36.250 --> 08:39.334
named Camargo. There was a school in the town, the 
public said it was for the government, for men in

08:39.354 --> 08:47.525
one place and for women in another. They didn't 
count as they do now. They had separate schools.

08:52.454 --> 09:20.031
They used to wear, instead of, you know, now that 
the group

08:52.454 --> 09:20.031
was theirs,

09:20.365 --> 09:29.614
They did it in this country also, where they wore 
just a cloth to flatten down. You know, that's the

09:29.674 --> 09:34.018
way she was brought up. The higher relatives, you 
know. It's true. Los padres estaban muy delicados

09:38.142 --> 09:44.248
en esos días, sí. Era muy bueno, es muy bueno. La 
disciplina. Sí, disciplina. ¿Cuándo? Sí. At that

09:50.268 --> 09:55.998
time they didn't have birth control pills.

09:58.121 --> 10:01.988
Discipline is still a good idea. Cass has become 
completely obsolete.

10:07.197 --> 10:13.147
¿En qué modo se encuentra con su esposo? ¿Usted? 
¿Su esposo? Yes, but I never danced with him. No,

10:19.502 --> 10:19.983
no. I danced with others.

10:26.372 --> 10:29.837
And they told me in my house that I hadn't met him 
before. Well, they gave him a thousand kisses.

10:35.341 --> 10:41.672
What I can't understand is how do you get to know 
people if you don't let them go out? That's what I

10:41.752 --> 10:42.713
say too. Why did they do that? I don't know. I met my 
children and I did. My children had a boyfriend.

10:49.765 --> 10:54.113
They talked to me, I told them, they went to the 
dance, I took them. If they were there behind us,

10:54.133 --> 10:56.016
what would they do to me? That was my law here. But 
how did the man know, as if he had asked a woman, how

10:59.601 --> 11:04.667
do you know if he wants to marry you? No, well, 
that's how you talk, that's how you know him. Like

11:07.030 --> 11:10.514
me, my husband, I didn't even know his voice. And we 
were very happy to see him. And I didn't know him, I

11:13.217 --> 11:16.081
didn't talk to him, I couldn't. Well, they would 
wake me up and scold me when they asked me that his

11:16.101 --> 11:22.488
sisters had made me fall in love with him. And I 
would say, yes, mamacita, then, no, mamacita, no.

11:25.592 --> 11:26.813
They appreciated me, they loved me. pero nunca me 
dijeron quién es mi mamá. Eran también detenidas

11:30.592 --> 11:32.335
de su boca. Sí, me visitaban y yo, un poco, pero nos 
visitábamos. Pero él no sabía de parar dónde yo

11:37.362 --> 11:41.609
estaba ahí en su casa. Y con esa condición iba, que 
no fuera él a estar ahí. Para que vea lo que la

11:45.134 --> 11:49.500
castigaban a uno. Mis hijas no. Mis hijos no. 
Bueno, cuando su papá

11:57.691 --> 12:00.034
How do you say it? I understand that you have a 
boyfriend. What does he do? He repels. What? He

12:10.448 --> 12:11.850
repels, he scolds me. Oh. Yes. He never scolds me. 
The last time I gave him a kiss because I knew he

12:14.033 --> 12:18.158
wasn't good. And he didn't go. He's still 
suffering. Poor child. But I used to talk to those

12:21.263 --> 12:23.766
other boys. I was at the school and they invited me 
to go to their house. What did they do? I didn't talk

12:29.145 --> 12:31.768
to them. They didn't do anything. How do you get 
married if you don't know them? Getting married

12:35.974 --> 12:42.023
without knowing them is very hard. But when your 
mother got married, your uncle... My grandfather

12:49.463 --> 13:17.530
died and

12:49.463 --> 13:17.530
she remarried a year later

12:49.463 --> 13:17.530
with the

12:49.463 --> 13:17.530
man that worked for her. So her grandfather, you 
know, was a poet. Yes, because my mother had very

13:22.072 --> 13:24.714
good help. Yes, with the children of a big father. 
He gave him, he gave one part and another part, and

13:26.636 --> 13:38.247
that he gave him a certain amount of little animals 
so that that man would also have them and help him

13:26.636 --> 13:38.247
with pleasure. That's how he did it with my 
grandfather. Yes. But when he got married, he

13:41.550 --> 13:44.392
turned into a... He didn't want to. Well, maybe 
not. I say no, not at all. First, I also said it was

13:49.520 --> 13:57.447
bad because she had a lot of children, mom, and she 
was fighting with children and all that. And now I

13:57.507 --> 13:59.709
say, no, what would have been of me if I didn't have 
my brothers? Now my brothers see me as... They got

14:00.930 --> 14:06.915
two general, two sets of family, her family, 
because they're all gone except her. And then they

14:06.935 --> 14:08.436
got the new marriage. Yeah. She got about 12 more 
kids. No, no, I say, thank God. Those are the only

14:11.559 --> 14:13.080
uncles we know. That she married, mom, and she gave 
me those beautiful and good brothers, my brother.

14:17.973 --> 14:22.579
The Martins both died, but both have left 
children. One has one and two children. Heraldo

14:24.321 --> 14:26.323
Tango came. Heraldo, the brother of Quino. I 
didn't know him, he rang the doorbell and said,

14:29.247 --> 14:33.152
shut up, sir. What do you want? I'm Heraldo. No, I 
don't know him, I don't know him either. No, now

14:39.379 --> 14:41.862
that he's so fat. Why did they come out so quiet? Why 
did they come out so quiet? It's because

14:46.593 --> 14:53.023
her mother is a woman. And then I had another 
brother. And I have my nephews. And I have my

14:57.350 --> 14:58.712
nephews. But I wouldn't have anyone to see me if my 
brothers didn't see me very, very well. They are

15:04.341 --> 15:05.202
very careful with me. And my nephews, my children, 
my brothers, men, they see me very carefully. They

15:09.168 --> 15:12.113
love me very much, their father, and they too. And 
their mother is very good with me. Very good with

15:14.076 --> 15:14.997
that family too.

15:19.651 --> 15:21.674
What else can I say? It's interesting. The thing is 
that I wish they didn't record. See, her mother, my

15:25.540 --> 15:31.229
grandmother, by trade, she was a midwife. In those 
times, there were no doctors. She was by

15:33.492 --> 15:35.034
profession a midwife. And as late as, I can't 
remember when, in investigations concerning

15:35.996 --> 15:45.190
people's birth, where they were born, they would 
come. I'm explaining to you that they would come

15:45.210 --> 15:48.595
and ask the older mother, When they were 
investigating where a person had been born,

15:49.132 --> 15:53.757
because she was part of it. They would come and ask 
her where this person had been born, because there

15:53.837 --> 16:02.206
was no paper. Nothing was recorded. It's bad that 
there was nothing recorded. Because he also lived

16:06.611 --> 16:09.314
75 years. And I'm already 78. And I haven't been 
able to go to rest. Because death is rest. Ya en la

16:19.118 --> 16:22.722
edad mía, de la edad. Una gente joven, no. Pero una 
gente vieja ya no puede hacer sus trabajos ni como

16:25.164 --> 16:32.372
los querían ni como quieren. Es duro y es pesado. Y 
vivo sola. ¿Y qué pasaba si yo mandaba a pedir a una

16:37.157 --> 16:42.583
muchacha para mandar a la comisión, así como si 
dices que? Y si les decían que no, ¿qué pasaba?

16:45.986 --> 16:46.847
Pues, ¿quién sabe? How about if your parents said 
no? They said no and no and no. If my parents had been

16:51.407 --> 16:57.074
very tough for that, the state would have been very 
tough. I say it shouldn't be like that. My

16:58.635 --> 17:04.162
sons-in-law, those boys that came, they are like 
my children to me. They see me as a mother. So I don't

17:05.623 --> 17:15.214
suffer because of the mandate, I don't suffer 
because of anything, they buy everything from me.

17:17.455 --> 17:24.096
They are good, because I loved them and I love them. 
The one I least wanted was Domingo, the one who

17:24.116 --> 17:28.510
served me the most. I didn't want them to get 
married. In Camargo, before the Revolution, were

17:30.466 --> 17:37.153
there richer families than us? Yes. Capital was 
everything there was. Capital was all the wealth

17:40.857 --> 17:43.940
there was. And sowing. But sowing on time. You 
know, it doesn't rain all the time. You don't

17:48.305 --> 17:50.767
harvest all the time. The sowing there, where 
there's no irrigation, there's no security. When

17:52.950 --> 17:57.514
you process some people, you're supposed to say 
excuse me. Excuse me. All right. We were also

17:59.238 --> 18:04.565
farmers and we lived in the ranches. It was like we 
made cattle and cows and everything in the

18:04.585 --> 18:09.531
ranches. Yes, but all the families are the same or 
are there differences? No, there are very lazy

18:14.797 --> 18:18.562
people who don't like to work. And there are people 
who like to just give the weight and spend it. There

18:24.829 --> 18:28.654
is the difference according to the customs. You 
know what she's saying? The people that work will

18:30.925 --> 18:33.768
well off and the people that don't well off. Right, 
right. Some people well off because they like to

18:34.128 --> 18:36.110
work. Yeah. But the differences then, basically, 
she's saying the differences came out of that

18:39.074 --> 18:49.426
rather than, you know, being a matter of work and 
this sort of thing. Camargo is very old. Yes, yes.

18:55.192 --> 18:56.734
And now how many people live there? It seems to us 
that there are people. It's small. Small. And what

19:01.732 --> 19:03.574
I don't like are the houses. How many people live 
here in Rio Grande City now? The last count was

19:07.758 --> 19:09.540
about 5,000. 5,000. I don't know. I'll see what the 
phone book

19:11.501 --> 19:17.347
says. And most of the people who live now in Rio 
Grande City were from Camargo? Or were they from

19:23.352 --> 19:26.215
Camargo ancestors? Are you still

19:26.735 --> 19:52.692
interested
