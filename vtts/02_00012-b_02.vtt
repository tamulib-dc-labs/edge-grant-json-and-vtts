WEBVTT

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.097
So many dinners at his place and so many meetings at that place that I know him already.

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:09.941
You're saying at his place, over where he lives?

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:10.162
Yeah.

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:13.927
I'm not a big fan of him though.

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:21.579
I think he's a good man, he does right, but sometimes, I don't know.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.426
Other proud moments as RHA president?

00:00:27.848 --> 00:00:29.110
Getting to serve on that

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.363
the bonfire committees.

00:00:33.565 --> 00:00:35.288
That was pretty good.

00:00:37.032 --> 00:00:40.058
And this is the committee to review and make recommendations?

00:00:40.078 --> 00:00:41.340
Yes, the big committee.

00:00:42.462 --> 00:00:43.605
Get to work with all those people.

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:47.833
Get to meet a lot of the people that I met this year.

00:00:48.434 --> 00:00:53.123
Make those

00:00:57.878 --> 00:00:58.519
What are they called?

00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:03.388
Acquaintances or get to meet all those people in those high places.

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:05.372
Did you meet some celebrities?

00:01:06.594 --> 00:01:07.576
Some famous people?

00:01:07.857 --> 00:01:08.037
No.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.964
You didn't get to shake hands with Tony Blair then last Sunday?

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:12.265
No.

00:01:13.327 --> 00:01:19.819
The only people were the Regents and this one time I was, Bowen has these,

00:01:21.453 --> 00:01:45.739
buffets before the games and this one time they asked me to speak at one of them and I spoke the week before when we played I think Baylor or I can't remember if it was Notre Dame or Baylor we were invited to that and I took a date with me and we were at this table, the table in front of us

00:01:46.225 --> 00:01:51.551
There was George, or old President Bush, Governor Perry, and a bunch of other people like that.

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:57.778
The week after that, we sat in that table, but we didn't have any important people there.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.686
And we tried to go up there, or some friends of mine tried to go up there and get his autograph or shake his hand, and they were told no.

00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:15.777
And the following week, when I was told I was gonna sit there and talk, I was like, if somebody big goes, I will get to meet him, but we didn't have the luck.

00:02:16.938 --> 00:02:24.605
Did anybody play any pranks or make any jokes on the RHA president during your term?

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:26.050
No.

00:02:26.793 --> 00:02:28.298
The biggest thing this year,

00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:37.421
And I've been told by a lot of the people that worked under me or that people had so much respect for me that that's why I got a lot of stuff done.

00:02:38.483 --> 00:02:42.550
Because they knew that I went in and I went in to do something and change things.

00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:45.234
That I didn't have a lot of pranks or anything like that.

00:02:45.635 --> 00:02:47.939
They were just, they should say they just respected me that much.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.439
Right.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.187
What did you learn about leadership from all this experience?

00:02:53.307 --> 00:02:54.910
It's a tough thing.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.312
Leadership is kind of tough.

00:02:57.073 --> 00:02:58.455
There's so many different groups.

00:02:58.475 --> 00:02:59.557
There's so much background.

00:02:59.977 --> 00:03:01.319
People that want to do their own thing.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.664
You can't always do the right thing.

00:03:05.305 --> 00:03:08.269
And even if you try and you think it is, it's not always the right thing.

00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:13.637
And even if you do think, many people are going to try to challenge it.

00:03:14.418 --> 00:03:15.320
It's hard to lead a group.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.626
It's hard to lead such a group that's 8,500 or more people.

00:03:20.427 --> 00:03:22.450
That is such a big organization to lead.

00:03:23.695 --> 00:03:26.079
and time management, anger skills.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.502
I was stressed most of the time this year.

00:03:28.943 --> 00:03:32.969
For the first time in my life I'd been that stressed and that mad at something.

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:36.575
And it was just, at one point I thought it was just too much to handle.

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:39.940
What would you do to get rid of those frustrations?

00:03:41.923 --> 00:03:43.566
Change your major, first of all.

00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:44.828
Change your major?

00:03:44.848 --> 00:03:45.549
Yeah.

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:46.851
From what to what?

00:03:47.135 --> 00:03:49.880
from probably electrical engineering to maybe history or.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.484
Oh, you, that's what you would have, but you didn't.

00:03:52.604 --> 00:03:53.085
No, I didn't.

00:03:53.185 --> 00:03:53.325
No, no.

00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:54.047
I was still engineering.

00:03:54.287 --> 00:04:00.257
It's a very tough major to be an A, and it's just too much time.

00:04:00.277 --> 00:04:04.845
I was spending 50% of my time in school, 50% with RHA.

00:04:05.486 --> 00:04:06.708
I didn't have a lot of free time.

00:04:06.868 --> 00:04:08.751
Did your grades this year suffer?

00:04:08.852 --> 00:04:09.733
Yeah, a lot.

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:14.261
Now when will you graduate?

00:04:14.862 --> 00:04:16.183
December of next year.

00:04:16.603 --> 00:04:16.984
Okay.

00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:19.426
Or this coming December.

00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:21.328
This coming December of 2002.

00:04:21.468 --> 00:04:22.089
Okay.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.371
Have you started to interview yet?

00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:24.912
Not yet.

00:04:25.552 --> 00:04:28.956
I'm planning to do that as soon as I can, as soon as I have a little free time left.

00:04:29.056 --> 00:04:30.838
When does your term officially end?

00:04:31.618 --> 00:04:31.999
Next week.

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:32.900
Next week.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.922
And is there a ceremony?

00:04:35.362 --> 00:04:35.863
It's a banquet.

00:04:36.803 --> 00:04:38.245
It's a passing of the gavel or whatever.

00:04:38.325 --> 00:04:39.186
I didn't even get a gavel.

00:04:40.107 --> 00:04:41.408
The person before me just

00:04:43.177 --> 00:04:46.882
didn't do a lot and just didn't decide to give me a gavel.

00:04:46.922 --> 00:04:51.388
He said it was important and he left the organization kind of in a bad state.

00:04:51.468 --> 00:04:55.854
Do you have any plans to give advice to the group at that banquet?

00:04:56.155 --> 00:04:58.097
Yes, I'm going to say my farewell speech.

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:00.821
What are the major points you're going to make?

00:05:00.841 --> 00:05:06.028
I haven't really done it, but one of the things is that I'm challenging them to make next semester better.

00:05:06.008 --> 00:05:08.791
so I can leave happy.

00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:15.818
I want them to be involved, and I want them to put their heart into it, because without heart, there's no point for them trying to do anything.

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:18.060
Are there any major changes?

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.267
If you had the authority to change the resident halls here, are there any changes you would make?

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.333
Yes, hall director, the way people pick hall directors.

00:05:31.254 --> 00:05:32.455
Some of those hall directors,

00:05:34.156 --> 00:05:35.418
really need to leave A&M.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.664
Some hall directors come in and they don't even like the school.

00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:42.952
I don't see how you're going to lead a hall if you can't be an Aggie.

00:05:43.493 --> 00:05:45.637
You don't like our traditions and stuff like that and don't come here.

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:57.919
I think one of the biggest things that I've said is that if they made the school smaller to where maybe like 20,000 but they were

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.105
proud Aggies, the school would be a lot better.

00:06:03.046 --> 00:06:05.830
I mean, I know there's people that come in just to study, and that's fine.

00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:07.052
I mean, they make the school look good.

00:06:07.754 --> 00:06:10.899
But those people that are going to study but be real Aggies can make the school a lot better.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.104
I would go with that instead of having 45 or 50,000.

00:06:14.264 --> 00:06:23.699
Let's see, would you change, we have, do we have coed resident halls?

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:24.721
Yeah.

00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:26.083
Is that good or not good?

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.941
For some halls it's okay.

00:06:28.462 --> 00:06:35.251
But the halls like Walton, Crocker, Moore, some of those that have been old, in old school, they should stay the way they are.

00:06:35.731 --> 00:06:38.435
Should we have no smoking floors?

00:06:38.855 --> 00:06:39.256
They have them.

00:06:39.576 --> 00:06:39.917
They do?

00:06:40.257 --> 00:06:41.058
Is that a good idea?

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:45.984
Yeah, because there's people that want to come in and do their thing and not have to worry about that.

00:06:46.084 --> 00:06:47.967
There's floors that are just no drinking.

00:06:48.828 --> 00:06:51.651
I mean there's people that are really like that, that's fine.

00:06:51.671 --> 00:06:53.133
I mean I don't see anything wrong with that.

00:06:53.434 --> 00:06:54.876
Is noise a problem?

00:06:55.076 --> 00:06:56.037
Sometimes.

00:06:56.405 --> 00:07:02.063
For me, it's sometimes hard to concentrate because I hear a little noise and I want to go out.

00:07:02.123 --> 00:07:05.554
Some of those halls are very noisy, but that's just the community.

00:07:07.103 --> 00:07:11.970
Let's see, other traditions that I should have mentioned, muster.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.192
Have you gone to muster?

00:07:13.252 --> 00:07:14.133
Yeah.

00:07:14.153 --> 00:07:14.734
I've been there twice.

00:07:15.595 --> 00:07:17.739
It's a spectacular thing.

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:22.626
It's just, I mean, those candles are being lit and being blown out.

00:07:22.646 --> 00:07:25.109
I mean, it's a beautiful thing.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.254
I'm going to do my 26th muster speech this year.

00:07:29.476 --> 00:07:30.177
What do you think of them?

00:07:30.638 --> 00:07:32.060
Oh, superb, superb.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.343
It's a splendid unifying.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.392
That's great.

00:07:38.894 --> 00:07:40.416
Your senior ring, when did you buy it?

00:07:44.341 --> 00:07:45.002
Last November.

00:07:46.123 --> 00:07:47.245
I think I've had it for a year now.

00:07:47.265 --> 00:07:48.106
How much did it cost?

00:07:48.126 --> 00:07:49.988
$400, I think.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:51.530
Was it your money?

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:52.291
Your parents' money?

00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:52.452
Who?

00:07:52.552 --> 00:07:53.092
My parents' money.

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:54.514
They kind of paid for it.

00:07:54.594 --> 00:07:55.976
How did you feel when you first?

00:07:56.537 --> 00:07:58.299
When I got it, I just couldn't stop looking at it.

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:00.482
It was just something very nice.

00:08:01.593 --> 00:08:03.199
Everybody always talks about their senior ring.

00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:06.130
Why is an Aggie senior ring special?

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.812
Because you've earned it.

00:08:07.816 --> 00:08:08.819
I really believe you've earned it.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.084
There's some people that

00:08:11.802 --> 00:08:13.003
They've been here and they put their time.

00:08:13.023 --> 00:08:15.566
I don't believe they kind of earned it, earned it.

00:08:15.786 --> 00:08:17.468
They're just here for the ring.

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:24.896
But if you're here and you do your part to A&M, not only to yourself, but to help other people and you get the ring, you know you've earned it.

00:08:25.256 --> 00:08:26.658
You've put so much time into it.

00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:31.843
Will you go to commencement when you graduate?

00:08:32.124 --> 00:08:32.324
Yes.

00:08:33.545 --> 00:08:34.686
Who do you think will be there?

00:08:34.967 --> 00:08:36.989
Who else close to you?

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:38.991
Friends or family.

00:08:40.422 --> 00:08:41.364
Definitely my family.

00:08:41.884 --> 00:08:42.225
How many?

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:54.605
Well, one thing that I haven't said is about two or three weeks ago I lost, I never lost anybody close to me.

00:08:55.887 --> 00:09:00.895
The closest that I had lost somebody were the 12 people that died in a bonfire because they had become part of my family.

00:09:02.798 --> 00:09:05.182
and that I had never lost anybody close to me.

00:09:06.203 --> 00:09:18.343
And about three weeks ago, I lost one of the closest people to me, which was my grandma, the one that I had grown up to and kind of she raised me.

00:09:20.028 --> 00:09:25.799
A few months ago, we had been talking, my aunt was there, and she said, are we going to get ready for your graduation?

00:09:26.481 --> 00:09:28.885
And they were saying yes, and my grandma was getting sick at that time.

00:09:28.946 --> 00:09:34.557
She wasn't able to speak that much, and she looked at her and said, we're going, right, to Jorge's graduation?

00:09:34.597 --> 00:09:35.338
And she's like, yes.

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:37.783
So...

00:09:41.088 --> 00:09:44.113
I'm going to dedicate that graduation to her.

00:09:44.634 --> 00:09:46.677
Yeah, when you've got that diploma, think of her.

00:09:47.318 --> 00:09:47.839
Think of her.

00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:52.286
What is it that pulls Aggies together?

00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:55.391
What makes Aggie spirit?

00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:57.574
The undefinable Aggie spirit.

00:09:59.097 --> 00:10:01.020
Explain Aggie spirit.

00:10:01.608 --> 00:10:03.070
I've tried so hard to explain it.

00:10:03.911 --> 00:10:07.035
And unless people are Aggies, they will not understand.

00:10:07.495 --> 00:10:11.841
But are there some key events that are part of creating that spirit?

00:10:12.662 --> 00:10:21.653
Just the unity that people, once they get here, when they become close to somebody that's an Aggie and they start explaining all the traditions and everything, that's the undying Aggie spirit.

00:10:22.874 --> 00:10:25.337
And it's true when they say the Aggie lore is that

00:10:26.937 --> 00:10:49.468
from the outside looking in you can't understand it from the inside looking and you can't explain it it's just once you come here you feel that spirit and you can try so many times to explain it but you just can't it's just people don't understand it they have to be they have to come and be part of it and that spirit can be created whether you're living in the core dorms or in walton hall

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:56.540
As long as you're here at A&M, I think you start feeling it from the moment you step on.

00:10:57.001 --> 00:10:59.346
You go to the first main ideal, the first Aggie game.

00:11:00.669 --> 00:11:03.415
People rub off on you and you know, you feel that spirit.

00:11:06.141 --> 00:11:09.128
Silvercaps a part of that, and Mustard?

00:11:09.368 --> 00:11:11.052
Of course, they all are.

00:11:12.128 --> 00:11:27.047
They're on later on, you know, you come in and later on that semester or later on that month or whatever, that's when you have the first and you start really feeling and you see around you and see all those Aggies willing to spend some time of their busy schedule to honor other Aggies.

00:11:27.307 --> 00:11:28.549
And that's just awesome.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.714
All right, now we've only got to get near the end.

00:11:33.395 --> 00:11:38.001
Among the questions I would ask these old Aggies is this one.

00:11:38.285 --> 00:11:41.688
What did you learn at A&M that has been important to your life?

00:11:41.928 --> 00:11:43.190
Now, they'd be looking back.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:48.374
What have you learned at A&M so far that you think is going to be important in your life?

00:11:48.815 --> 00:11:50.576
Trusting the people you work with.

00:11:50.596 --> 00:11:50.977
I'm sorry?

00:11:51.177 --> 00:11:52.538
Trusting those people you work with.

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.340
I mean, you have to trust people.

00:11:55.741 --> 00:12:04.569
And once you leave here, you're going to have to trust either, even if they aren't Aggies, you're going to have to look for people and be friends with them.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.532
A lot of the stuff you learn here is how to make those friends.

00:12:07.934 --> 00:12:20.068
So once you leave from here, a lot of people are so close-minded, even when they're here or they're out of here, but open your mind and just... And that's another thing that RJ has taught me, that be patient on a lot of things.

00:12:20.729 --> 00:12:21.530
Stuff will come.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:26.216
Now, A&M Spirit, does it draw people in, or does it exclude people?

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:32.423
Different groups exclude people, but A&M itself brings people in.

00:12:34.445 --> 00:12:40.191
And did A&M, your experience at A&M, help your work habits?

00:12:41.433 --> 00:12:41.633
Yeah.

00:12:42.434 --> 00:12:45.778
First of all, my study habits, yes.

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:46.699
I had to learn how to study.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.383
Work habits, definitely, because I was able to work on Bonfire.

00:12:50.403 --> 00:12:57.010
I was able to do RHA, which is a big time consuming and a big organization that you have to learn how to work.

00:12:58.711 --> 00:13:10.945
Alright, if you were hired as a consultant to Texas A&M's leadership today to advise them about A&M's future, what advice would you give them?

00:13:11.726 --> 00:13:17.993
First of all, don't exclude people because of backgrounds or anything like that.

00:13:18.914 --> 00:13:28.245
One of the big things was, and I could feel that when I became president a lot of people were talking behind my back saying he's not going to be good because he's got a bonfire past.

00:13:28.546 --> 00:13:30.850
Because you never know how somebody's going to turn out.

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:36.218
They could look like the most perfect person or president, and they turn out to be really bad.

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.984
Or somebody that you see him, you're like, this guy's not going to be good at all.

00:13:40.866 --> 00:13:45.413
Turns out to be such a great asset to your organization that he changes everything.

00:13:46.374 --> 00:13:49.580
So one thing would be give a person a chance.

00:13:50.381 --> 00:13:52.344
And there's some people that you know are not going to be good.

00:13:52.644 --> 00:13:56.190
You can tell by the way they act and the way they look at other people and the way they talk.

00:13:57.048 --> 00:14:01.655
but I still believe you should give them a chance and see what happens.

00:14:02.316 --> 00:14:05.140
Let those student leaders make the decisions.

00:14:05.681 --> 00:14:07.183
You're a consultant, you're an advisor.

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:13.752
If you need to step in, step in, but let them take care of it because that's their organization.

00:14:13.772 --> 00:14:13.993
All right.

00:14:14.013 --> 00:14:23.967
Now, nothing you have said, have you given me the impression that anything was more difficult for you here made difficult for you because you were Hispanic?

00:14:24.723 --> 00:14:26.327
I try not to ever look at it like that.

00:14:26.367 --> 00:14:27.169
All right.

00:14:27.209 --> 00:14:33.484
You give me the impression that you were an individual, and is that a correct perception?

00:14:36.631 --> 00:14:36.711
Yes.

00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:37.473
Definitely.

00:14:37.533 --> 00:14:40.099
I've never had that problem.

00:14:41.412 --> 00:14:55.279
Maybe a few times you're in there at this maybe thing that I thought people were maybe thinking because he's Mexican or he's light skinned or he's darker skinned than we are or something remotely being racist.

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:58.425
But if that has happened, I put it on my mind.

00:14:59.047 --> 00:15:03.876
I don't let that run my everyday life or anything like that.

00:15:03.856 --> 00:15:10.205
You hinted that if you were a decision maker A&M would not be any larger than it is now.

00:15:10.786 --> 00:15:15.552
If you were the emperor, how large would you have A&M?

00:15:16.373 --> 00:15:20.719
The biggest I would let it be maybe 45, 46.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:21.981
About what it is now?

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:23.122
Yeah.

00:15:23.142 --> 00:15:24.064
I think it's a great number.

00:15:24.104 --> 00:15:31.534
The only way I'd see it be bigger is better faculty as well.

00:15:33.353 --> 00:15:34.355
capable of teaching.

00:15:35.537 --> 00:15:45.194
To what A&M students, faculty, staff, et cetera, to what people connected with A&M do you feel the most gratitude?

00:15:45.515 --> 00:15:47.618
Walton Hall.

00:15:47.638 --> 00:15:48.079
By far.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.562
Your buddies there?

00:15:49.622 --> 00:15:54.210
If I wouldn't have lived there, I don't think anything that I've done up to now, I don't think I would have done anything up to now.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.594
You think you've made some friends for life there?

00:15:56.614 --> 00:15:58.197
Definitely.

00:15:59.695 --> 00:16:03.779
I'll see them whenever I can at their weddings or anything like that.

00:16:03.819 --> 00:16:06.041
All right.

00:16:07.443 --> 00:16:08.524
Next to last question.

00:16:09.465 --> 00:16:19.975
If you had the financial capability to make a major gift to Texas A&M, a million dollars or more, for what purpose would you want that gift used?

00:16:21.376 --> 00:16:25.180
To build a new headquarters for Residence Life.

00:16:26.442 --> 00:16:29.790
and the new residence halls I want to do, to have it done at the same time.

00:16:32.978 --> 00:16:33.880
That would be pretty important.

00:16:34.762 --> 00:16:36.005
All right, then the last question.

00:16:36.967 --> 00:16:40.496
What feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M?

00:16:42.922 --> 00:16:44.265
I have a lot of love for it.

00:16:44.853 --> 00:16:47.300
And it's not so much the university itself, but the students.

00:16:50.088 --> 00:16:51.752
I care a lot about the freshmen that are coming up.

00:16:52.575 --> 00:16:56.486
That they get treated kind of the way I got treated when I came in.

00:16:56.526 --> 00:16:57.729
They get accepted.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:59.875
They have a chance to become involved.

00:16:59.855 --> 00:17:01.918
because that is important.

00:17:02.059 --> 00:17:04.302
All of us, the older group, are going out.

00:17:05.103 --> 00:17:06.225
So it doesn't matter what we say.

00:17:06.265 --> 00:17:14.558
As important as those freshmen coming in and they have the right stuff and not be led the wrong way and all that stuff.

00:17:14.739 --> 00:17:16.622
So I care a lot about this place.

00:17:17.784 --> 00:17:18.525
It's in my heart.

00:17:20.167 --> 00:17:20.869
It's changed me a lot.

00:17:20.889 --> 00:17:21.690
It's given me a lot.

00:17:24.354 --> 00:17:26.217
And it's such a special place.
