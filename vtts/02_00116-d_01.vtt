WEBVTT

00:02.798 --> 00:04.280
going to get anybody in trouble. So when the 
doctor, when I awakened and the doctors came in and

00:04.380 --> 00:10.811
they asked you all those questions and they said, 
what will you do? I said, I fell down the stairs.

00:13.174 --> 00:20.526
And, uh, you know, and I don't know who that 
upperclassman was, but I always thought that I did

00:13.174 --> 00:20.526
the right thing because nobody got in trouble. And 
it was my, it was my mistake for hitting my head on a

00:20.566 --> 00:25.434
radiator. Um,

00:30.676 --> 00:33.339
Yeah, okay. I didn't talk about President 
Williams, but I got to meet him at Clemson. Oh, yes,

00:39.026 --> 00:40.268
yes. When I was an ROTC instructor and going to 
graduate school at night at Clemson, I was playing

00:40.368 --> 00:58.050
handball with the athletic director at Clemson in 
the summer before, I guess it was the summer of 72.

00:58.418 --> 01:02.607
saw where the Aggies were going to come to Clemson 
University for the first time ever. And Clemson

01:03.397 --> 01:06.601
was still a high school football team. They were a 
powerhouse of a basketball program, but their

01:06.621 --> 01:13.229
football program was sophomoreish. And the 
Aggies, by 72, had a heck of a program. And so, man,

01:17.214 --> 01:20.678
the Aggies were coming to Clemson. And we were on 
the East Coast there, so I told athletic director,

01:20.998 --> 01:32.172
if you can get me 50 tickets that I can buy together 
on the 50-yard line, I'll get 50 Aggies there. When

01:32.607 --> 01:34.229
it was all said and done, we had 1,500. The band 
didn't come, but the Rioliers came and Dr.

01:34.309 --> 01:43.220
Williams came because he had been from Clemson. 
And all of a sudden, I think he figured out that he's

01:43.280 --> 01:53.933
got 1,500 Aggies coming from Washington, D.C. to 
Florida and all the Carolinas and Georgia. And he

01:54.915 --> 01:59.340
can go back to his old school and he can kill... 
several birds with one stone. So he came and we had a

02:01.314 --> 02:04.459
big barbecue the night before. And then we had the, 
you know, all the activities, had yellow practice

02:05.260 --> 02:10.367
before the game. And we beat Clemson so bad it was, 
matter of fact, I was kind of proud of the Aggies.

02:16.596 --> 02:26.311
They played the second half, they played their 
third, fourth, and fifth teams the whole, the

02:16.596 --> 02:26.311
first, second, third team didn't play the second 
half. And they beat them like 40 or 50 to nothing. It

02:28.634 --> 02:29.395
was terrible. but but uh you know they was done with 
class i mean they could have beat them 100 to

02:29.948 --> 02:59.331
nothing at the rate they were going um but i got to 
meet dr williams one time and it was very personal i

02:29.948 --> 02:59.331
mean i was the guy in charge of the setting up this 
program and everything and so you know i was

02:29.948 --> 02:59.331
escorting him around and and i'd you know i knew the 
president of clemson at the time i'd gotten to know

02:29.948 --> 02:59.331
him a little bit and i knew a lot of leadership in the 
athletic department so it was kind of a special

02:29.948 --> 02:59.331
weekend for me and i thought You know, and I hadn't, 
he was, you know, the General's successor, and I

02:59.733 --> 03:12.765
felt pretty good after meeting him that he could 
handle, you know, the General Rutter legacy. You

03:12.945 --> 03:16.915
know, I was impressed with his credentials.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.521
Yeah, balanced life. Yeah, I got that point. Yeah, 
sir, I pretty well, I think I hit all the points on

03:27.464 --> 03:33.630
your notes. Then the last question. Yes, sir. What 
feelings do you carry in your heart for Texas A&M

03:36.273 --> 03:39.817
now?

03:44.321 --> 03:52.369
At 56, and I just turned 56 last month, and now I'm 
back here, and I'm interacting again with old

03:53.547 --> 03:56.030
friends. Oh, I forgot to talk about Buck Wires, but 
Buck was a good friend of mine. I mean, and I dated

04:01.035 --> 04:03.057
his daughter. It was one of the few ladies that I 
would date, and I don't think we were ever going to

04:03.077 --> 04:14.288
be in love, but we were good friends. And then I got 
to know Buck through his daughter, and he was

04:14.509 --> 04:18.913
special. But I think being back and everything 
here, I went back to Houston after being gone for

04:19.636 --> 04:33.190
37, 38 years, and I was not at home. I stayed there 
three months. I was in my old stomping grounds.

04:40.317 --> 04:41.498
That's where we got our apartment. And Jeannie and 
I were just not comfortable. We came up here and we

04:45.202 --> 04:47.905
moved to College Station. And it has been coming 
home. And so in my heart, I've lived all over the

04:52.028 --> 04:56.674
world. I've been to 63 countries at least once, and 
I've been to several of them a dozen times. And I

05:05.044 --> 05:08.168
come back to Texas A&M, and I've come back home. And 
that's a feeling. that you can only get if you've

05:10.733 --> 05:17.656
been all around the world for most of your adult 
life and done all the things I've done. And it's a

05:17.696 --> 05:22.110
very comforting feeling. I've gotten to know Dr. 
Bowen, and I'm so inspired from all the things he's

05:22.917 --> 05:32.367
had to do and his handling of the bonfire. I thought 
it was such world-class handling of such a

05:33.048 --> 05:38.214
traumatic event. When you send your kids to the 
military, you know there's a chance they'll die in

05:38.754 --> 05:47.044
combat, but when you send them to college, you 
don't think they're going to die. And I've been

05:47.945 --> 05:51.068
very impressed with how he and the leadership has 
handled something that I thought was, you know,

05:51.925 --> 05:57.091
one of the great tragedies of all universities. 
So, no, it's hard to describe, and I don't do an

05:58.032 --> 06:20.599
adequate job of articulating really personal 
feelings, but it is, I think it capsulates it when I

05:58.032 --> 06:20.599
say, when we came back to A&M to live, and Jeannie 
says, the next move is to the cemetery. This is our

06:21.895 --> 06:28.090
27th home, and we feel like we're at home. We're 
with friends. We're in an unbelievable comfort

06:30.335 --> 06:33.562
zone here. That's a great ending.
