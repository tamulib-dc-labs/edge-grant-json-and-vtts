00:01.870 --> 00:08.138
an interview with Tom Rugg, conducted by David 
White, Texas A&M University, on April the 22nd,

00:01.870 --> 00:08.138
1989. Now,

00:08.158 --> 00:27.745
we had stopped off with the spring of 1968 and Tet, 
and you concluded by saying that you had definite

00:08.158 --> 00:27.745
feelings at the time, but nothing really now, 
correct? Well, it was nothing. I had no specific

00:28.586 --> 00:30.949
recollection of what the Tet Offensive meant or 
didn't mean to me at the time. I just don't recall

00:35.901 --> 00:38.827
that now. I recall you said that you thought that 
what we were doing over there was wrong. Was it just

00:43.335 --> 00:50.989
our foreign policy was wrong, or did you feel that 
how we were conducting our foreign policy was

00:43.335 --> 00:50.989
wrong, or was it something else entirely? No, I 
guess it was both.

00:58.857 --> 01:13.018
I did not think then, and I have seen nothing to 
change my mind in the years that have passed to the

00:58.857 --> 01:13.018
present time, that we had any business in Vietnam, 
period. However, the country often does things

01:13.559 --> 01:22.452
that some of the people of the country don't agree 
with. In fact, that's just sort of the nature of the

01:22.592 --> 01:24.555
beast. If we were going to be there, then it was just 
incomprehensible to me that the war would be

01:29.198 --> 01:39.142
managed in such a way that we couldn't possibly win 
it or achieve a military objective. And it was also

01:39.824 --> 01:42.330
apparent that that was going on. So it really made 
no sense. First of all, I disagreed with being

01:45.070 --> 02:01.508
there, but if we were going to be there, then let's 
at least let the military people manage the war in

01:45.070 --> 02:01.508
such a way that they can achieve a military 
objective, whatever the hell that was going to be,

01:45.070 --> 02:01.508
if they wanted to own all of Southeast Asia, 
whatever the military objective was going to be.

02:02.208 --> 02:10.377
Let the guys who know how to achieve that objective 
go and do it, and don't put artificial barriers on

02:02.208 --> 02:10.377
them and tell them, well, you can do this or you 
can't do that. That's where a part of all that

02:11.285 --> 02:18.777
insanity of Agent Orange came up with. It was neat. 
We can't fight a jungle war because we don't know

02:19.999 --> 02:27.010
how, and we're not going to train or learn how, 
apparently, so we'll kill the jungle. Well, it's

02:27.331 --> 02:31.016
insanity, just absolute insanity. But that's the 
kind of things that were going on.

02:37.206 --> 02:38.929
You said that they should be free to... fight what 
war they wanted to yeah if you're gonna if you're

02:39.685 --> 03:03.465
going to

02:39.685 --> 03:03.465
allow the country to become involved in a war then 
first of all let's call it a war let's have the

02:39.685 --> 03:03.465
congress declare war and let's let the military 
people go win it if that's what the policy of the

02:39.685 --> 03:03.465
country is going to be And I don't have to agree with 
that individually that that's what the policy

03:03.783 --> 03:33.098
ought to be, but if that's what the leadership of 
the country says we're going to do, then let's

03:03.783 --> 03:33.098
don't fight the war in such a way that we're 
guaranteed to lose it and that we're going to

03:03.783 --> 03:33.098
maximize our casualties and that it's going to be 
as crippling as it can be, that it's going to go on

03:03.783 --> 03:33.098
forever and ever with no definable objectives 
being obtained or even being talked about such

03:03.783 --> 03:33.098
that it tears this country apart internally. That 
war went on forever. Incredibly long period of

03:37.119 --> 03:38.901
time. With no popular support after we'd been in 
the war for a while. You know, the Vietnam War

03:46.970 --> 03:51.275
protest didn't start from day one. It's after it 
went on and on and on. And our commitment to it got

03:54.319 --> 03:58.984
more and more and more and more people were being 
killed. and it became more and more obvious that

03:59.420 --> 04:12.872
the war was being fought in such a way that it could 
not be won, then lots of people started asking

03:59.420 --> 04:12.872
questions like, what in the hell are we doing 
there? I mean, that didn't start from the

04:12.892 --> 04:14.614
beginning. That was a period of time. It was just a 
total and mismanaged process. Now, had you been

04:21.661 --> 04:28.667
president at the time, Just have withdrawn the 
troops totally, or would you have let them go off to

04:29.120 --> 04:33.845
fight their own war? Oh, I'd

04:33.865 --> 04:39.590
have withdrawn the troops. Definitely. Yeah, I 
wouldn't have had them there in the first place.

04:43.054 --> 04:54.845
I'd have ended up where Richard Nixon ended up 
after we killed a half million people and maimed

04:43.054 --> 04:54.845
millions of others and put emotional scars on 
people who never went there. Yeah, I'd have never

04:54.865 --> 04:56.667
gone through that process. It was in sight. You 
know, what has this country lost by not having a

04:58.313 --> 05:04.621
military presence in Vietnam, and we haven't had 
one for a long time? Nothing. We had no reason to be

05:06.964 --> 05:11.490
there to begin

05:06.964 --> 05:11.490
with. Talk about Richard Nixon. So you would say by 
the, you know, 68 was an election year. You would

05:19.641 --> 05:27.291
say that by the end of the summer you were beginning 
to formulate opinions about who you wanted for

05:19.641 --> 05:27.291
president, or were you even concerned about 
voting? Oh, yeah. I don't think I've ever missed an

05:31.141 --> 05:33.124
election. I vote in the local elections. In fact, 
I've got to vote absentee. I'm going to be out of

05:38.393 --> 05:44.203
town when the local elections come up here in 
another two weeks.

05:45.746 --> 05:53.920
Yeah, I was very much interested in who was going to 
be president and not going to be president back in

05:45.746 --> 05:53.920
those years.

05:58.220 --> 06:01.405
And, of course, the main issue, I guess, was 
Vietnam. Certainly, from my perspective, the

06:02.146 --> 06:10.440
foreign policy was really the dominant issue 
because of Vietnam. Were you inclined to lean

06:10.460 --> 06:14.527
towards one candidate or another?

06:17.672 --> 06:20.437
I didn't see, no, I really wasn't. There wasn't a 
candidate around that I liked. You know, Richard

06:24.562 --> 06:28.307
Nixon pulled out of Vietnam because there was no 
other alternative. I mean, they were totally beat

06:28.627 --> 06:32.712
militarily before they left. Nobody was 
advocating that we pull out, which was my

06:32.732 --> 06:37.438
preference. And ultimately what happened in 
terms of our disinvolvement in Vietnam was

06:38.880 --> 06:44.968
inevitable. It was just a question of who happened 
to be in the White House when it occurred it was

06:45.568 --> 06:49.453
going to happen. Do you remember Chicago that 
summer? I remember the news accounts of it, and I

06:54.599 --> 07:02.671
remember that it would have been a neat place to 
have been. I would like to have been there. Would

07:06.156 --> 07:08.159
you have taken part actively? Yeah, you betcha. I 
really would have. I'd have enjoyed that. That

07:11.283 --> 07:12.104
would have been fun. Did you look up to any of the 
people who were eventually

07:12.865 --> 07:21.518
quote-unquote charged with inciting the riot, 
like... Hoffman or any of those other people? No, I

07:26.290 --> 07:31.055
didn't have any idols that I followed around 
during those years.

07:34.479 --> 07:36.541
None of the names were important to me. It was the 
issues. I didn't care about who the media selected

07:37.582 --> 07:43.748
to be the stars or who the spokesmen were. It was the 
issues from my perspective. For whom did you end up

07:47.152 --> 07:50.095
voting for president that year and why? I don't 
even remember. I honestly do not remember. I

07:55.973 --> 08:00.439
really didn't feel that there was, I didn't feel 
like it made any difference, that there was a real

07:55.973 --> 08:00.439
choice.

08:03.804 --> 08:07.269
And I can't remember who I voted for. In the fall of 
68, did you notice any increasing activism on

08:07.349 --> 08:15.400
campus or were you still pretty much apathetic?

08:18.822 --> 08:19.803
I can't remember. I really cannot remember levels 
of campus activity tied with any particular time

08:19.923 --> 08:31.475
period.

08:31.495 --> 08:34.558
Well, can you remember any specific protests on 
campus? Not that I could give you details of. I know

08:38.582 --> 08:39.923
there were some. Didn't seem like there was a lot of 
organization in anti-war feelings. And there

08:47.811 --> 08:48.812
seemed to be. Again, more organization out at 
Lamar when we got into funds that were racially

08:49.450 --> 08:57.083
oriented. I can remember a couple of pretty 
good-sized demonstrations that involved racial

08:57.263 --> 09:06.379
issues, and I really don't remember organized 
sizable demonstrations involving Vietnam,

09:07.422 --> 09:12.268
which is not to say there weren't any. There just 
aren't any that I remember that stick out in my

09:12.288 --> 09:15.832
mind. Were any of the racial demonstrations 
linked to Vietnam over, say, the number of black

09:15.852 --> 09:23.862
troops that were getting killed compared to the 
white troops? No. In fact, I'm not even sure when I

09:25.364 --> 09:34.054
became aware of the racial disparity in the way 
assignments well, in the draft generally, but in

09:34.490 --> 09:40.735
assignments particularly to Vietnam areas. I 
know that, and it may have been after I got out of

09:40.795 --> 10:03.535
college that I first became aware that blacks were 
being assigned in disproportionate numbers to

09:40.795 --> 10:03.535
the Vietnam War effort and were suffering 
naturally as a result of that,

09:40.795 --> 10:03.535
disproportionately high casualties. relative 
to their proportion of the population in this

10:04.747 --> 10:09.472
country. I mean, there's some pretty obvious 
reasons for that. Would you say then that, in

10:15.819 --> 10:25.208
general, the students down here were more 
concerned with issues closer to home than some

10:15.819 --> 10:25.208
more often in Asia? Yeah. See, I don't even 
remember any big war protests cranking up after

10:33.856 --> 10:41.243
the lottery system came out, student deferments 
were going to be a thing of history, and if your

10:33.856 --> 10:41.243
number was bad, you were up. And you would have 
thought, if anything, that that would have

10:41.263 --> 10:56.098
cranked it up, that that would have really started 
the effort, the war protesting effort,

10:41.263 --> 10:56.098
particularly for those who were going to be 
targets of the draft and who had low numbers. But

10:56.118 --> 10:59.201
those people just kind of disappeared. They went 
off to war is what happened to them.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.906
What were you doing in 1970? Were

11:07.087 --> 11:13.295
you still in school? Oh, yeah. I didn't graduate 
from Lamar until 1972.

11:20.824 --> 11:27.492
Well, I spent six years in undergraduate school, 
but I was a student most of that time and had

11:20.824 --> 11:27.492
170-some-odd undergraduate hours. And because 
you had that low lottery number and in French you

11:28.554 --> 11:32.719
declared 4F, Yeah, the war, so far as me 
personally, it was obvious that I wasn't going to

11:33.610 --> 11:39.618
be able to go if I wanted to go. Even if you enlisted? 
I couldn't enlist. 4F. 4F, you don't enlist

11:43.323 --> 11:45.425
anywhere. I wouldn't go into the war. Now, just to 
clarify, this is for the Army, correct? Well,

11:50.472 --> 11:54.658
selective service, they were just drafting into 
the Army. You had long lines of people trying to get

11:55.058 --> 11:59.584
into more favorable forms of service. who 
otherwise knew they were going to get drafted.

12:02.442 --> 12:04.225
Such as National Guard or Navy? Oh, yeah. Those 
people weren't having much trouble getting

12:04.966 --> 12:08.911
recruits. The foot soldier was the guy who was 
being drafted. If all had ever occurred to you that

12:14.359 --> 12:18.806
if you had been drafted, you might have been sent to 
someplace like Europe? Certainly possible, I

12:19.286 --> 12:23.372
have. I had some friends who went to Germany and 
Europe. During that time? Yeah. How did they feel?

12:30.614 --> 12:42.566
I know some of them were happy to be in Europe and had 
done everything possible within the workings of

12:30.614 --> 12:42.566
the Army to ensure that they went anywhere other 
than Vietnam. So they were quite happy with

12:44.247 --> 12:45.969
themselves. Yeah. Well, people who are career 
military tend to be fairly satisfied with the

12:48.932 --> 12:59.102
Army, the short-timers. one-term enlisted 
folks. You don't run across many of them who speak

13:01.938 --> 13:06.645
glowingly of military service. But they were 
certainly pleased that their duty assignment

13:06.665 --> 13:13.314
didn't put them in Vietnam. Do you remember 
hearing about the U.S. involvement in Cambodia?

13:18.741 --> 13:20.183
Yeah. Cambodia and Laos both. And it seems like the 
mayor will remember that the media made a a big deal

13:28.597 --> 13:30.360
out of it. Of course, they'd like to do that anyway, 
but they uncovered these excursions into Vietnam

13:30.380 --> 13:43.541
that we didn't have the permission of, excuse me, 
the incursions into Cambodia. We didn't have the

13:43.961 --> 13:46.686
permission of the Cambodia government to be 
there. It violated all sorts of laws and

13:48.709 --> 13:54.418
international laws to go do things like that. and 
the news media made a real big event of having

13:55.478 --> 13:58.902
uncovered it. And, of course, the government, of 
course, was denying it. The government had so very

14:03.046 --> 14:08.532
little credibility with me at that point in time 
that I could have written the scripts for them.

14:09.533 --> 14:10.534
They denied everything. If it was bad, they denied 
it. If it was good, they patted themselves on the

14:11.715 --> 14:13.938
back.

14:17.061 --> 14:21.586
Were you better at the government for lying to you? 
I think disillusion is a better term. I don't then

14:23.913 --> 14:35.192
and I do not now understand why the government feel 
like it is necessary to deliberately deceive the

14:23.913 --> 14:35.192
people who put them in power. I don't understand 
that attitude. It is an attitude that some

14:37.476 --> 14:44.868
political leaders are afflicted with. My view is 
they tend to be concentrated in one particular

14:46.171 --> 14:49.937
party. particular political bias that I happen to 
hold. And I suppose it's not fair to make fun of the

14:55.343 --> 15:02.011
Republicans who've had some unfortunate... 
Don't go ahead if you feel that way. They've had

15:02.131 --> 15:12.304
some people of unfortunate

15:02.131 --> 15:12.304
character at the head of their party. People whose 
character could not even be described as

15:12.324 --> 15:16.068
questionable anymore. They were downright 
dishonest. And I do not understand... why people

15:20.478 --> 15:28.533
of power feel like it is necessary to lie, deceive, 
and mislead those who've put them there. That's a

15:28.553 --> 15:36.308
betrayal of trust which they've been granted, and 
those kind of people are very disillusioning to

15:28.553 --> 15:36.308
me. Because the political process does not 
guarantee that that kind of person rises to the

15:36.328 --> 15:41.477
top, you understand. It has happened. And it 
disillusions people with the political process

15:43.377 --> 15:53.392
generally, and it shouldn't because that's not a 
necessary outcome of the political process.

15:53.412 --> 16:02.145
So by the spring of 72, for example, you were just 
feeling pretty much the government can go shove

15:53.412 --> 16:02.145
its head in the sand or something like that? Yeah. 
Of course, the spring of 72 is my graduation time.

16:12.267 --> 16:21.496
I'm going to graduate from Lamar as a university, 
first May graduating class after Lamar attained

16:12.267 --> 16:21.496
university status, and I don't have a job. And the 
prospects for getting one, well, I have a job. I'm

16:25.720 --> 16:29.704
working at a job I could have had with a high school 
education. I'm working in an automobile trim shop

16:30.224 --> 16:35.589
and continued to do that job after I graduated. I 
looked around a little bit, looked for some of the

16:35.729 --> 16:40.654
jobs you could get with them. a business degree and 
didn't really like any of

16:41.461 --> 16:47.627
it. What were your feelings in 72 when the 
elections came around? Were you satisfied with

16:51.271 --> 16:53.774
what Nixon was doing? Or did you feel it was a crock? 
Oh, I never did like Nixon. He was just not a

16:59.980 --> 17:06.046
favorite of mine.

17:06.066 --> 17:06.827
And still isn't.

17:11.633 --> 17:23.991
Did you feel that he was doing a good job of getting 
the troops out of Asia, or was he just doing what he

17:11.633 --> 17:23.991
had to do in order to keep from losing all face? He 
was doing what he was. We were beat. I mean, I

17:26.935 --> 17:33.565
realize it wasn't necessarily being portrayed 
that way, but they were leaving Vietnam. It was

17:33.625 --> 17:34.867
either leave or die. Those were not good options at 
that point in time. We were beat. We've been losing

17:41.570 --> 17:43.354
the war for years. Sooner or later, you're going to 
have to concede defeat. That's all that was going

17:46.079 --> 17:47.863
on. He didn't deserve any pat on the back for doing 
what he had to do.

17:54.276 --> 17:59.386
It was long since past time to wave the white flag. 
He doesn't get any kudos from me for doing what was

18:00.368 --> 18:03.274
inevitable. Did he or any of the other presidents 
do anything that ever got you thinking to say, hey,

18:04.655 --> 18:13.723
maybe I better get out on the streets and protest?

18:16.466 --> 18:17.026
Well, let's see. The last time I was on the streets 
was when the Iranians took over our embassy.

18:26.575 --> 18:32.080
No, I think

18:26.575 --> 18:32.080
it. By 1972, it was time for me to start getting on 
with my life and planning on going somewhere. You

18:40.760 --> 18:51.553
know, the war was a dead issue by then, and it was 
time to move on, time to figure out something to do,

18:40.760 --> 18:51.553
some sort of a career to follow. So when the 
Christmas bombings came in 1972, you just kind of

18:51.573 --> 18:57.661
sighed in resignation?

18:59.964 --> 19:01.105
I don't even remember that. I don't have any 
recollection

19:01.962 --> 19:08.268
of that at all. Except 1975, Vietnam fell.

19:13.994 --> 19:15.316
What do you remember about that?

19:23.043 --> 19:31.632
I remember, it seems like the news media had quite a 
heyday with the panic scenes at Saigon airport.

19:36.016 --> 19:47.146
And it seems to me that I recall thinking that it is 
long since past time that we got out of there. And

19:47.166 --> 19:57.495
that this is not gonna result in any great upheaval 
or turmoil or chaos in the rest of Southeast Asia.

19:59.537 --> 20:06.023
Unlike the people who were predicting the doom and 
the eventual fall in the entire world as we know it.

20:06.610 --> 20:11.297
we lost this little tiny thing called Vietnam. I 
had determined before that that was just a bunch of

20:11.317 --> 20:17.506
baloney anyway. Really very anticlimactic, I 
guess, for me.

20:28.022 --> 20:34.592
To digress a bit, you were in college during that 
time. 75? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 68 through 72

20:38.674 --> 20:48.908
when we seem now to make so much about, oh, that was 
the age of Aquarius and all this stuff that they

20:38.674 --> 20:48.908
would call counterculture. What were your 
recollections of that? I'm not sure there was a lot

20:52.252 --> 20:59.061
of counterculture going on in Beaumont

20:52.252 --> 20:59.061
from 68 to 72. That was something that was going on 
out on the west coast, I thought. And that's That's

21:04.340 --> 21:07.083
really about as close to that as I got. I wasn't 
having to do it. There was a bunch of nuts out on the

21:09.004 --> 21:12.227
west coast. So you'd say pretty much here that we 
were concerned more with what was around us than

21:12.247 --> 21:22.076
what was not around us. Well, no, I don't think 
that's necessarily fair either. I think my

21:28.983 --> 21:33.807
generation

21:36.605 --> 21:54.448
was somewhat,

21:36.605 --> 21:54.448
and this is true and was true generally everywhere 
I was, is that my generation honestly did not trust

21:36.605 --> 21:54.448
the generation above us, our parents' 
generation, their leaders. That was true for me

21:55.970 --> 22:03.540
and was true, I think, for a lot of people. The more 
vocal and sometimes violent parts of that

22:04.600 --> 22:12.331
occurred in other places and were media events. 
But I honestly believe that my generation

22:13.273 --> 22:33.122
genuinely did not, as a whole, and certainly 
that's not true for everybody, but as a general

22:13.273 --> 22:33.122
rule, genuinely distrusted and disliked the 
generation that preceded us who was then in power.

22:33.142 --> 22:33.983
And I think we could build a pretty good case for 
feeling that way. Do you really blame Vietnam on

22:41.487 --> 22:51.160
any one person besides, well, you seem to have an 
insubordination towards Nixon. Are there any

22:52.101 --> 22:57.268
other people or persons that you would single out 
in your mind? No, Vietnam, let's see, that can't

22:57.328 --> 23:02.054
happen. One person couldn't do a Vietnam. It takes 
a collection of people in power, but it takes a

23:04.709 --> 23:23.178
collective attitude on the part of a country that 
really doesn't care and isn't paying attention to

23:04.709 --> 23:23.178
what's going on to get you into Vietnam. And that's 
why I don't think you've seen the repeat of that in

23:23.198 --> 23:32.573
areas like Honduras, for example.

23:33.447 --> 23:43.638
where at least in a geographical sense, it would 
make a lot more sense to have an American military

23:33.447 --> 23:43.638
presence in Honduras than Vietnam. But you don't 
see that. And yet all you've got there is an

23:45.300 --> 23:57.733
internal civil war, basically between

23:45.300 --> 23:57.733
sort of democracy-oriented people and sort of 
communistic-oriented people. And it's a

23:57.853 --> 24:02.458
fundamental civil war we have going on. and one 
that's the Vietnam story. And you can't blame any

24:09.409 --> 24:13.194
one person for us getting involved in that. It's a 
national mistake. I'm sure that the people who got

24:17.340 --> 24:24.750
in there did not get into Vietnam thinking, boy, 
isn't this going to be fun to have a national

24:17.340 --> 24:24.750
disaster. Obviously, I think there were men with 
good intentions who were wrong, in a country that

24:31.767 --> 24:48.930
wasn't paying attention until when the country 
did start paying attention, then it was a very

24:31.767 --> 24:48.930
long, slow, painful process to get out of the 
mistake we'd gotten ourselves into. What did you

24:49.351 --> 24:53.456
end up doing after you received your 
undergraduate degree? I worked for a year and then

24:54.638 --> 24:59.344
enrolled in law school at the University of Texas. 
You didn't view law school as any sort of

25:00.472 --> 25:07.780
compromising any ideals that you had? Yeah, law's 
a profession. You can do anything you want to with a

25:11.184 --> 25:16.991
law degree. You don't have to be involved in 
government. You can be a wild ass independent ACLU

25:22.116 --> 25:29.905
type of person, or you can go to work in Washington. 
The whole world is up until you were alone. If you

25:35.233 --> 25:46.428
had been born 20 years earlier so that in 1968

25:35.233 --> 25:46.428
you would be as old as you are now. You mean if I had 
been born 20 years later? 20 years earlier. 20

25:49.932 --> 25:51.735
years earlier than 48? That would be 1928? Okay. I 
would have just missed World War II. Obviously.

26:01.660 --> 26:22.245
Knowing having enough world knowledge as you do 
now, meaning that in 1968 you were a fairly mature

26:01.660 --> 26:22.245
person, law degree, fairly successful, 
established practice, do you think you would have

26:01.660 --> 26:22.245
felt the same way about the wars you did then? 
Probably not.

26:28.610 --> 26:37.179
As you get over and you get more established and set 
in your ways, it tends to be a little bit more

26:28.610 --> 26:37.179
difficult to get you stirred up and riled up.

26:40.382 --> 26:42.484
But I can't say for sure. I know

26:42.504 --> 26:58.600
the way I feel today, if someone were to suggest 
that an American military presence in Honduras

26:42.504 --> 26:58.600
was a good idea, you'd never be able to sell me on 
that one. But that might be because of the Vietnam

26:59.558 --> 27:03.683
experience.

27:06.887 --> 27:08.689
I don't know. Very difficult times. You're coming 
off of Korea, which was, I guess you could call it a

27:11.212 --> 27:23.126
draw, but sort of this multinational exercise in 
killing people in Korea. In itself, a very

27:24.348 --> 27:27.912
interesting war from a historical perspective. 
But you don't have a whole nation protesting your

27:28.668 --> 27:35.336
involvement. It's a relatively short war and 
results in, I guess, a more or less satisfactory

27:35.356 --> 27:43.426
negotiated solution.

27:47.231 --> 27:49.975
It's certainly much different than the Vietnam 
result. So you wouldn't have in your own makeup a

27:50.816 --> 27:58.405
historical perspective of what's going on. To a 
certain extent, I guess you could justify the

27:59.954 --> 28:15.934
Korean War involvement as a part of our 
responsibility to the United Nations, which was

27:59.954 --> 28:15.934
then and still is a pretty novel experiment. But at 
least it gives countries a forum where they can

28:16.014 --> 28:22.181
yell at each other. Do you think the UN should have 
gotten involved at all in NOM? Run that one by me

28:26.647 --> 28:27.548
again. Do you think that the U.N. should have been 
called in in Vietnam?

28:36.121 --> 28:36.741
No. Of course they couldn't because of their 
system. The system, the way it worked, it wasn't

28:42.449 --> 28:48.497
realistically possible for the United Nations to 
get involved. They'd never gotten involved in

28:48.697 --> 28:50.860
Korea. Russia hadn't got the red ass and walked out 
of a Security Council meeting. They learned that

28:56.187 --> 28:57.248
lesson. So there wasn't any realistic chance of 
the United Nations getting involved in Vietnam.

29:03.203 --> 29:08.589
You might have had a very much different solution 
if that had happened. Certainly, you would have

29:08.609 --> 29:25.750
had a little more collective military wisdom 
involved, and you would have had a very different

29:08.609 --> 29:25.750
political leadership involved as opposed to the 
President of the United States, chief commander

29:08.609 --> 29:25.750
of the war effort in Vietnam, you'd have had. 
entirely different political setup out of the

29:26.371 --> 29:35.183
United Nations, saying, you know, it might have 
made a world of difference, but I don't think it

29:26.371 --> 29:35.183
would have necessarily made it right.

29:38.067 --> 29:44.596
You know, I suppose if these countries want to get 
together and have civil wars, they ought to let

29:38.067 --> 29:44.596
them do it. You know, we did one here. And the 
country survived and rolled on. Vietnam has

29:51.164 --> 29:53.087
survived and rolled on. Their political 
leadership may be one that we've all been told

29:53.692 --> 29:57.696
we're not supposed to like. But I don't know. They 
work fine for them. If Vietnam, instead of being

30:03.343 --> 30:19.281
some nation halfway across the globe, had instead 
been some little island about 500 miles off

30:03.343 --> 30:19.281
Galveston, do you think our attitudes would have 
been any different? I think that might have

30:19.301 --> 30:22.264
affected some people. But it shouldn't. We've had 
Cuba 90 miles off the coast of Florida for a long

30:24.845 --> 30:30.432
time. So the big fear is, oh, my God, the communists 
will be too close. They'll be able to hit us with

30:34.657 --> 30:36.499
missiles. Well, who are you kidding? They can hit 
us from central interior Russia. So that doesn't

30:40.984 --> 30:43.648
make any difference. No, it shouldn't make a 
difference. It probably would for some people. If

30:50.881 --> 30:57.227
there was one thing in your mind that you could have 
changed about that whole era, what would it have

30:50.881 --> 30:57.227
been? You mean me personally? You personally. Me 
personally?

31:04.593 --> 31:05.674
And then for the nation. Yeah, I don't know. That's 
a tough one, me personally. I'm not really unhappy

31:10.959 --> 31:16.244
with my life as it went through those years. I would 
like to have not... particularly in high school,

31:21.577 --> 31:35.597
have had to go to so many different high schools and 
so many different places and constantly have to

31:21.577 --> 31:35.597
start over, knowing no one, and have to start over 
building new friends only to leave them all and go

31:21.577 --> 31:35.597
on and do that again. That's not fun. I would want to 
do that again, and I won't do that to my children.

31:40.505 --> 31:43.108
I'll find a different line of work, although I'm 
very stable now. What about for the nation? The

31:45.191 --> 31:49.778
nation, they should have walked away from Vietnam 
when they were invited. They just said, no, we're

31:50.737 --> 31:56.502
not going to do that. The French couldn't make it 
work. We don't think we're any better at it than

31:58.684 --> 32:03.428
they are. You folks over there in that part of the 
world need to sort this out on your own. I see. Well,

32:11.075 --> 32:13.317
that concludes this interview. I want to thank you 
for taking time out of your schedule. And again,

32:16.500 --> 32:18.702
this is going into the... The Texas A&M Oral 
History Collection in the University Archives.

32:26.635 --> 32:28.260
And that's it. Thank you very much. Thank you.
