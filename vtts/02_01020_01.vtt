WEBVTT

00:02.123 --> 00:03.164
in the year of 1969-70? That's correct. Okay. Why 
did you decide to become involved in the anti-war

00:07.170 --> 00:10.915
movement at Southwest? Well, I'd been involved in 
the anti-war movement in New York City, and when I

00:11.736 --> 00:23.973
arrived at Southwest, there was very little in the 
way of any war activities or organized activities

00:11.736 --> 00:23.973
going on. So I, along with some other people, there 
was a coffee house on campus that was sponsored by

00:30.794 --> 00:33.458
one of the church groups. And that was sort of the 
focal point where we started having meetings of

00:34.479 --> 00:49.582
people who shared a similar interest in seeking to 
organize protests to speak out in a unified,

00:34.479 --> 00:49.582
organized manner against the war in Vietnam. 
Okay, did you have more than one organization or

00:49.602 --> 00:55.050
was it one central organization there at the 
university? At the time I got there, there wasn't

00:55.771 --> 00:58.194
any organization. What we did was we organized an 
ad hoc committee to organize anti-war activities

01:01.186 --> 01:19.322
and basically I along with a few other students 
formed a committee that began to organize and

01:01.186 --> 01:19.322
coordinate anti-war protests. Okay and how many 
students did you have by the time you left involved

01:20.223 --> 01:26.568
in the movement? I would say that by the time I left 
they were probably some three to four hundred

01:30.194 --> 01:34.378
students that were actively involved. And how 
many students were at Southwest at that time? I

01:39.143 --> 01:41.266
think it was something like 12,000. 12,000? Okay, 
to you and to the people who formed the committee,

01:43.087 --> 01:51.096
what did the whole terminology of movement mean to 
you? It meant a way of expressing our sentiment,

01:51.116 --> 01:57.923
our belief about what was going on in Vietnam, that 
this country should not be participating in that

01:58.072 --> 02:13.410
kind of activity, and that we were not going to just 
passively sit back and allow the government to

01:58.072 --> 02:13.410
initiate and continue policies that we were very 
much opposed to. There were points in terms of

02:15.893 --> 02:24.062
demonstrations at Southwest Texas that at one 
point probably involved as much as 10% of the

02:15.893 --> 02:24.062
student body. So more people just joined with you? 
More people joined. The demonstration the

02:27.394 --> 02:34.925
evening that we were suspended from school in 
November probably had 2,000 people. Many people

02:35.726 --> 02:51.068
who even did not agree with our views necessarily, 
or at least had felt some kinship with our views,

02:35.726 --> 02:51.068
decided this was a terrible way to treat students, 
people who were expressing themselves on the

02:35.726 --> 02:51.068
Ernie Ward position. But it also brought out other 
students who felt strongly about the war, had some

02:54.367 --> 03:06.425
misgivings about the war, and were finally 
speaking out against it, or at least engaging in

02:54.367 --> 03:06.425
some activity designed to protest our activity. I 
think what it showed the administration was that

03:07.386 --> 03:17.642
many students did not like what was going on in 
Vietnam. They had some misgivings. It was

03:20.337 --> 03:29.589
difficult for a lot of students because a lot of the 
students there had grown up in very conservative

03:20.337 --> 03:29.589
rural Texas or small town Texas backgrounds. And 
you just didn't question authority. You didn't

03:32.052 --> 03:34.315
question administrators. And this was something 
that people decided to do. In the article that you

03:39.301 --> 03:47.452
have in the Texas magazine, I don't know if you 
remember that, you talk about your parents, they

03:39.301 --> 03:47.452
had the American dream. And you also talk about... 
how it was a time that you could question the things

03:51.438 --> 03:59.425
that you weren't supposed to question and just 
forbidden things that you shouldn't talk about.

04:00.266 --> 04:04.630
How did your parents feel about what you were doing 
at school? Well, they were very much upset about

04:04.650 --> 04:06.952
it. They were concerned about it because they 
thought that somehow this wasn't right, that you

04:07.012 --> 04:20.685
don't question the authority of the government to 
do what it deems necessary in its governmental

04:07.012 --> 04:20.685
policies. and it was very upsetting for them. They 
grew up in a time when the government was, you just

04:23.178 --> 04:28.506
don't question the governmental authority. 
Okay, what were the aims and goals of the

04:31.131 --> 04:35.758
organization itself? The aims of the 
organization were to try and make students aware

04:36.439 --> 04:47.517
of what was going on in Vietnam and to try and give 
students a vehicle to express their opposition to

04:48.087 --> 04:52.371
the war in Vietnam. The goal was to try and get the 
government to change its policies in Vietnam.

05:05.943 --> 05:14.331
It wasn't only, I think, to try and stop the draft, 
but certainly a lot of draft age people were

05:05.943 --> 05:14.331
involved at that time. But it just wasn't merely 
that we were going to be shipped off to war. It was an

05:19.350 --> 05:30.085
overall expression that the policy that this 
government was pursuing was one that was unfair

05:19.350 --> 05:30.085
and unjust, and we wanted to try and change that. 
And we believed that by voicing opposition, by

05:30.105 --> 05:39.939
mobilizing public opinion, that the government 
would have to change its policy. And also, it was

05:39.959 --> 05:47.710
one of encouraging people our age to think before 
blindly going in and serving in the armed forces.

05:48.112 --> 05:51.416
to pursue a policy that we thought was just inane. 
Okay, do you feel that you reached any of these

05:52.458 --> 05:57.485
goals that the organization had? I think we did. In 
terms of the goals also, the goal was to provide a

05:59.467 --> 06:11.504
vehicle for expression among students and people 
in the community to express their feelings

05:59.467 --> 06:11.504
against the war. I think that we brought about a 
change in governmental policy. I mean, we being

06:17.107 --> 06:24.619
San Marcos as part of what we viewed with the entire 
anti-war movement ultimately brought about a

06:17.107 --> 06:24.619
change. The government could not pursue its 
policy the way it initially had planned because of

06:24.639 --> 06:30.348
the intense opposition. I think as far as giving 
people a means of expressing their opposition, I

06:31.891 --> 06:37.880
think we really met that goal. Because a lot of 
people who felt in opposition to the war were

06:42.365 --> 06:47.371
inhibited because they weren't sure who else was 
opposed to it or how other people might react. I

06:47.391 --> 06:52.877
mean, demonstrations at that point were a very new 
item in San Marcos. It had just never happened. And

06:55.460 --> 06:58.804
people had a means where people joined. The first 
demonstration drew quite a bit of a crowd. The

07:03.750 --> 07:05.652
second one, a much larger crowd. There were 
probably about 1,000 people all together. When I

07:09.753 --> 07:20.273
gave you that figure earlier, about 300 to 400, I'd 
say that's more of a core of people that were fairly

07:09.753 --> 07:20.273
actively involved and could be counted on to 
protest or join demonstrations. But there were

07:20.293 --> 07:28.328
probably 1,000 people at the moratorium that was 
held in September, or rather October, the first

07:20.293 --> 07:28.328
one. And then the one in November where we were 
suspended was even larger. Okay, so my next

07:32.703 --> 07:37.528
question was, did you see any changes that took 
place in Southwest? So obviously you did. And you

07:39.450 --> 07:45.636
just went about getting these changes by having 
more and more students gain confidence? Yeah,

07:45.836 --> 07:51.863
confidence that they could speak out, that their 
voice would have some effect. By voicing what they

07:52.263 --> 07:57.208
felt, what their beliefs were, it would have some 
effect on the administration. and the

07:57.931 --> 08:08.368
administration was forced to basically allow 
students their expression, their right of speech

07:57.931 --> 08:08.368
that the administration had tried to stifle 
before. The suspension of us, the administration

08:10.271 --> 08:19.686
had to really back off when the Fifth Circuit 
allowed us to go back in school and finish the

08:10.271 --> 08:19.686
school year. Okay, in this article it said that 
there were nine of you that were suspended. That's

08:25.946 --> 08:26.767
correct, nine students. Is that the nine leaders 
of the organization, quote-unquote leaders?

08:30.571 --> 08:32.994
Right, quote. It also says that later ruled that 
you were denied the student credit. Right. What

08:37.759 --> 08:40.903
happened was we were allowed to finish the school 
year. The administration would not give us the

08:40.963 --> 08:48.171
actual credits we had earned until there was a 
final resolution of the case. How long did that

08:48.772 --> 08:49.673
take? That took about three more years. So for 
three years, you were in limbo as to whether you had

08:53.929 --> 08:58.295
the credit for that year. That's right. OK, that 
kind of gets in the way of school. Yeah, it

09:01.800 --> 09:03.662
essentially lost. I mean, even at that point, I 
went ahead and graduated from City University of

09:04.363 --> 09:08.850
New York in June of 72. And it wasn't until that fall 
that the US Supreme Court finally ruled. So it

09:15.138 --> 09:17.181
almost was moot at that point. But yeah, I just 
couldn't count on those points. Right. What was

09:22.209 --> 09:23.530
your draft status? It was the college deferment, 
which I believe was 1S or 2S, which was just a

09:24.451 --> 09:32.559
college student. I read in another article in a 
book,

09:33.439 --> 09:41.106
what part did you play in the class war, Daddy? And 
they were talking about how he tried to get out of

09:41.947 --> 09:48.313
being put through the draft board by being really 
underweight for being his height. Did you know a

09:50.927 --> 09:53.249
lot of... Well, sure. I knew of people who either 
tried to exaggerate any kind of physical defect or

09:53.269 --> 10:03.538
play on psychiatric or psychological problems. 
There's a myriad of ways people seem to try and use,

10:05.180 --> 10:08.703
yeah. There was a lot of that. Did you have an 
underground newspaper? Yes, we did. It was called

10:15.068 --> 10:16.950
the Weather Report. Do you have any copies of that?

10:23.562 --> 10:27.526
I might, it's just been so long I'd have to look.

10:30.029 --> 10:34.014
We also had the Purgatory Creek Press, which was 
actually published in 1969. I'd have to look to see

10:34.114 --> 10:37.878
if I've got any copies. Okay, if you had some would 
you send those to me? Sure. Or copies of the copies?

10:41.342 --> 10:42.123
Yeah, sure. Okay.

10:46.327 --> 10:50.371
Were your views on the Vietnam War then versus now?

10:54.935 --> 11:00.420
Well, I think in terms of my views then, I think I've 
expressed those to you. Now, I still feel very much

11:01.341 --> 11:04.164
the same way. It was a war that we should never have 
gotten involved in. It caused tragic loss of

11:07.447 --> 11:12.452
American life, loss of Vietnamese life. It 
created a whole class of Americans that came back

11:13.225 --> 11:21.734
from the war that were alienated, that had drug 
problems, mental problems. It was just a great

11:23.516 --> 11:28.102
disaster for American youth. I mean, still today 
there are lots of guys who went off to Vietnam and

11:28.122 --> 11:37.492
came back that have tremendous emotional as well 
as physical problems because of what happened

11:28.122 --> 11:37.492
there. I mean, it was just a war that was not 
accepted. People came home and you weren't

11:40.656 --> 11:42.878
considered a hero. People just looked at you 
either as a killer or someone who didn't have

11:43.330 --> 11:54.446
enough courage, you know, to tell the government 
to go to hell.

11:54.466 --> 11:56.809
And so I still feel the same way. I think that we were 
pursuing basically a throwback to the

11:56.849 --> 12:06.944
imperialist policies or this colonial type 
policies that Americans had engaged in for many

11:56.849 --> 12:06.944
years. And we just hadn't learned at that point 
that you just can't keep on doing this. We met a

12:13.013 --> 12:20.000
different kind of military foe in Vietnam that 
could not be dealt with in conventional military

12:13.013 --> 12:20.000
ways. Okay, you mentioned the fact that people 
looked at returning veterans as people who

12:20.901 --> 12:30.231
couldn't tell a government to go to hell. Do you 
think that it had a lot to do with the Camelot that

12:30.271 --> 12:36.957
Kennedy portrayed at the beginning of the war? 
Yeah, I think that has something to do with it. I

12:39.340 --> 12:42.463
think that a lot of people weren't really sure what 
was going on in Vietnam. People still wanted to

12:44.384 --> 12:56.278
believe the government when the government was 
telling us that we were fighting, you know, to save

12:44.384 --> 12:56.278
these people from a communist bloodbath or from, 
you know, this communist slavery. And Americans

12:56.919 --> 13:04.708
didn't have the means or the information to really 
question, and a lot of them didn't think about it.

13:05.909 --> 13:06.510
And it wasn't until a lot of the Vietnam veterans 
who came back from the war started complaining and

13:06.980 --> 13:20.392
questioning the policies that I think a lot more 
people started taking note that maybe what the

13:06.980 --> 13:20.392
government was telling us was not completely 
true. And at that point I think there was a

13:21.333 --> 13:24.977
contingent of Vietnam vets. Two of the people in 
our group, or at least one of them for sure, had been

13:25.117 --> 13:34.185
to Vietnam and had fought. as a whole or at 
Southwest, was it based on issues or ideologies or

13:34.722 --> 13:40.649
both? I'd say a combination of both. You had, I 
think, a broad spectrum of people in terms of their

13:45.474 --> 13:50.580
ideology. But the various issues about the war 
united people. People felt this was not right,

13:55.166 --> 14:03.295
that we should not be in this war, and that it wasn't 
accomplishing any purpose. that what we were

14:04.034 --> 14:06.897
doing was slaughtering a lot of people. It was an 
endless, senseless loss of life. How did the

14:10.000 --> 14:16.967
community of San Marcos react to the protesters at 
the school? They were very hostile to the

14:16.988 --> 14:21.612
protesters, to the activities that were going on. 
We were joined by some members of the community,

14:21.712 --> 14:30.902
some faculty members, and some people who lived in 
the community.

14:32.097 --> 14:41.651
But for the most part, we were basically 
considered agitators, people who were just

14:32.097 --> 14:41.651
causing trouble, communists. I was called Yankee 
agitator by a number of people. They didn't like it

14:47.559 --> 14:48.520
at all. They just saw this as a great, tragic, 
treasonous-type disruption of their community.

14:54.149 --> 14:58.695
Growing up with the parents that you had and their 
American dream and you believing this for years

14:59.097 --> 15:12.309
and years, and suddenly something coming up 
against that, and then someone calling you a

14:59.097 --> 15:12.309
communist and saying you're part of a conspiracy, 
that burst your bubble of what the American dream

14:59.097 --> 15:12.309
was about? I wouldn't say it burst my bubble. It 
made me realize that people that, you know, for a

15:15.192 --> 15:26.742
long time I had just incorrectly held to too much of 
an authoritarian type line that many people in

15:15.192 --> 15:26.742
this country had, that you know, certain things 
were always right. Whatever the government did

15:30.366 --> 15:32.649
was basically right. And that, I learned at that 
point, or had in high school realized, come to

15:33.490 --> 15:40.378
realize that that was not always true. I went to a 
high school where we were taught very much to

15:41.920 --> 15:47.006
question almost everything. And I think that 
carried on to my years in college. And as a result, I

15:51.511 --> 15:55.075
just could no longer just hold to the same kind of 
ideology that my parents and relatives had.

16:03.426 --> 16:10.977
Speaking of the community and how they reacted to 
you, did you ever face any physical danger

16:03.426 --> 16:10.977
yourself? How did the police react to you in the 
establishment? I faced a number of threats and

16:15.002 --> 16:23.374
there were a couple of close calls with vehicles in 
terms of that seemed like, you know, I'd been

16:23.928 --> 16:28.273
almost hit a few times by cars. There was a lot of 
threats, a lot of people in passing cars or just

16:30.456 --> 16:37.924
there were some phone calls and things like that. 
There was quite a number of threats. The police

16:40.908 --> 16:42.570
seemed indifferent to it. We also had a 
demonstration that May or April of 70, in which we

16:49.190 --> 17:05.246
almost had a physical confrontation that the 
school officials apparently chose to ignore, and

16:49.190 --> 17:05.246
we were able to diffuse it at the last moment by 
basically singing America the Beautiful and a few

16:49.190 --> 17:05.246
other things. But there was, the school officials 
basically would not have minded if we'd have

17:05.366 --> 17:11.452
gotten beaten up. Okay. Also in that month, May 3rd 
and 4th of 1970, There were four students killed

17:18.181 --> 17:23.246
and 10 wounded at Kent State by the Ohio National 
Guard. What was the reaction in San Marcos and the

17:23.887 --> 17:27.451
Southwest about that? We had a candlelight 
demonstration the night or two following the Kent

17:27.471 --> 17:35.480
State incident. And there were well over 1,000 
students that participated in that. And we also

17:40.505 --> 17:46.011
had the demonstration I just described to you. 
during the day in which the administration, there

17:46.430 --> 17:56.945
were a lot of cowboys around that were threatening 
us, and the administration basically just chose

17:46.430 --> 17:56.945
to ignore it. And fortunately, though, there 
wasn't any violence.

18:05.998 --> 18:11.366
Going on towards civil rights a little bit, did 
Southwest have any black students at that time?

18:11.647 --> 18:12.348
Were they enrolled? They had some. They had a black 
club a black political club. The black student

18:19.616 --> 18:22.240
body was still very small. Did they join you in the 
movement against Vietnam? Some of the blacks did.

18:27.748 --> 18:32.334
I'd say there were several blacks in the 
organization, but not a lot. The blacks were

18:32.354 --> 18:45.613
somewhat uncertain in the sense that they had 
relatives who were telling them this was wrong,

18:32.354 --> 18:45.613
and they were just very uncertain about joining 
that kind of activity. Were you involved in any

18:46.201 --> 18:48.764
part of this civil rights movement? I had been 
involved in some marches in New York City in high

18:50.386 --> 18:56.493
school. But as such, in San Marcos, it was 
essentially the anti-war movement. Were there

19:03.121 --> 19:07.686
quite a few women involved in the movement? Yeah, 
there were, I'd say, probably at least a third And

19:11.800 --> 19:14.384
there was no problem with them being involved in 
that group? It wasn't a sexist movement? No, I

19:16.347 --> 19:19.352
would say no. There are several organizations 
listed in this book, three. The students working

19:25.541 --> 19:31.851
for a democratic society on campus, and

19:34.902 --> 19:37.826
the Student Mobilization Committee. Right. Did 
those play an effect on your campus? Were you

19:41.551 --> 19:42.812
involved in those? Were they... Yeah, the Student 
Mobilization Committee was kind of a nationwide,

19:42.932 --> 19:51.984
or at least it operated out of Washington, or they 
had various chapters. There was a chapter in

19:52.405 --> 20:02.918
Austin that we coordinate our activities with, 
because we did go to a major Washington

19:52.405 --> 20:02.918
demonstration through the Austin chapter. in 
November or December of 69. And that was basically

20:07.353 --> 20:17.504
a group that laid out strategies and set dates, 
national dates for activities. So that was a group

20:17.524 --> 20:27.054
that was basically provided some leadership or 
some direction for local chapters around the

20:17.524 --> 20:27.054
country. And we sort of saw our group as basically a 
chapter of the Student Mobilization Committee.

20:33.560 --> 20:44.217
The Students for a Democratic Society, by 69, did 
not have a chapter in, they had one in Austin, but

20:33.560 --> 20:44.217
not in San Marcos. They, at that time, they were 
beginning to fade out, weren't they? Yeah, by 69

20:47.703 --> 20:59.162
they had, because in May of 69, there were the 
demonstrations at Columbia by Mark Rudd, who was

20:47.703 --> 20:59.162
one of the leaders of the SDS. That was sort of the 
beginning of the end where it started to fade out.

21:07.019 --> 21:15.070
In the book, Who Spoke Up?, there was mention of 
bombings and arsons, arson cases sweeping the

21:07.019 --> 21:15.070
country at college campuses. How did the people at 
Southwest feel about that type of violent action?

21:20.517 --> 21:25.543
The administration was extremely paranoid about 
that happening. There were not any instances of

21:26.064 --> 21:28.727
bombing or arson. But the administration was 
extremely paranoid that that would happen. And at

21:33.774 --> 21:38.040
one point, we had a demonstration where we marched 
on the administration building. And we later

21:38.781 --> 21:44.309
found out that the administration had ordered 
records sealed and locked. And they were afraid

21:44.349 --> 21:48.214
that we could go into the records and destroy 
things. The administration was extremely

21:49.115 --> 21:51.378
paranoid. All of our demonstrations were heavily 
marked by security, campus security, watching

21:51.398 --> 21:57.567
us. In the same book, Kissinger is quoted as 
saying, Nixon never found the language of respect

21:58.576 --> 22:12.079
and compassion, which might have created a bridge 
at least to the more moderate elements of the

21:58.576 --> 22:12.079
anti-war movement, so that civil war conditions 
developed. Did you at the time feel that you were

22:12.620 --> 22:15.244
involved in a civil war? I wouldn't say, well, not a 
civil war in the sense that we had bullets flying

22:16.807 --> 22:24.600
between sides, But it was a situation with a great 
deal of tension, a great deal of almost daily

22:25.171 --> 22:36.882
confrontation, a great deal of threats, extreme 
concern for one's safety. And I felt that at any

22:38.304 --> 22:43.249
time, any of us could be harmed. And there was a 
feeling of us against them. The community was

22:48.654 --> 22:53.018
deeply divided, and we were in a much smaller 
segment. And we were considered as somehow

22:53.943 --> 23:14.649
traitors, people who, you know, we were, a lot of 
the townspeople, a lot of people who'd never been

22:53.943 --> 23:14.649
to college, viewed us as having some kind of 
privilege to go to college, and how could we be

22:53.943 --> 23:14.649
doing this, meaning, you know, complaining to our 
elders about their policies when they'd given us

22:53.943 --> 23:14.649
college. I mean, there was this kind of mentality.

23:18.974 --> 23:21.317
How did the coverage of Vietnam on television 
through the news and newsreels. How did that

23:24.091 --> 23:25.352
affect the movement? I think it had a very positive 
effect on the movement. I thought television

23:28.435 --> 23:33.719
brought home the reality of what was going on in 
Vietnam. People saw that it was gruesome, that it

23:34.360 --> 23:45.910
wasn't getting anywhere, and that it was not the 
way the administration wanted us to believe it was

23:34.360 --> 23:45.910
happening. In your own terms, can you define 
hippie? Yeah. I suppose hippie was someone who was

23:52.111 --> 24:13.884
opposed to the establishment ways of doing 
things, the orthodox ways of doing things, and

23:52.111 --> 24:13.884
people who did various things to indicate their 
nonconformity by dress, clothing, use of drugs,

23:52.111 --> 24:13.884
hairstyles,

23:52.111 --> 24:13.884
shoe styles. Someone who was out of, away from or 
wanted to indicate that he did not go along with the

24:20.393 --> 24:23.497
mainstream. But in 69, you had a lot of people who 
ideologically were hippies, in the sense that

24:24.838 --> 24:39.316
they did not conform or did not believe a lot of what 
the mainstream or a lot of what... They didn't

24:39.917 --> 24:49.769
conform with the government's policies or 
believe or like the government's policies, but

24:39.917 --> 24:49.769
were still afraid to dress or act very 
differently. So you were a hippie? Yeah, I guess

24:51.443 --> 24:54.066
you'd have to say that. But at the time, you were 
proud to wear that label. Sure. I mean, at that

24:58.310 --> 25:03.995
time, that didn't bother me, and it still doesn't. 
I've been called an aging hippie.

25:09.240 --> 25:12.704
Do you consider the movement a failure or success, 
and in what ways? I consider it a success for a

25:13.705 --> 25:16.708
number of reasons. One, it got people thinking. It 
got people to think about their government's

25:21.582 --> 25:24.865
policies. It got people to realize that they could 
question them. And it got people to realize that by

25:28.329 --> 25:38.659
acting or by speaking out against what they felt 
was wrong or what was incorrect by the government,

25:28.329 --> 25:38.659
they could bring about a change. And I think that 
was probably the greatest success. I also think it

25:44.765 --> 25:49.750
was successful in the sense that it did bring about 
a change in the war. cut down eventually on the

25:50.523 --> 25:57.010
slaughter that was going on in Vietnam, both of 
Americans and Vietnamese. Do you feel that it

25:57.030 --> 25:58.612
failed in any way? Well, I think the only, in the 
sense of failure, it was not able to get the

26:00.975 --> 26:11.827
government to change its position soon. I feel 
like the failure is in the sense that it did not

26:11.847 --> 26:17.233
bring about a quicker change. It did not get 
people, more people involved. or convince more

26:20.729 --> 26:23.853
people to act on their beliefs. I believe in 1969 
there was a great deal of sentiment against the

26:23.893 --> 26:34.826
Vietnam War, and most people just basically held 
it back. Okay, when do you believe that the

26:34.866 --> 26:38.971
movement ended, and why did it end? I think it ended 
with the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam. I

26:45.439 --> 26:50.145
thought at that point people felt like there was no 
longer a need to protest about the government's

26:50.868 --> 26:56.898
policies because we weren't fighting in Vietnam. 
And I thought it kind of came to an abrupt end then.

27:00.323 --> 27:15.127
Although the movement tried to grab onto other 
issues, other policies, and keep itself going as a

27:00.323 --> 27:15.127
means of protesting or speaking out against what 
were considered unfair or unjust governmental

27:00.323 --> 27:15.127
policies. But it's very hard to get people 
involved and organized to get them out of the daily

27:18.678 --> 27:29.508
routine to really complain or protest about 
things that are going on that are not fair or just.

27:31.549 --> 27:35.253
When did you decide and why did you decide to go to 
law school? I had always wanted to be a lawyer even

27:36.834 --> 27:44.381
as a child, but I had somewhat questioned that in 
college. I think that what I went through in 69 just

27:48.412 --> 28:01.105
firmed up my resolve to go to law school because I 
realized that you could have so much more power and

27:48.412 --> 28:01.105
be so much more effective using the legal system 
than you could not being able to use that system.

28:01.125 --> 28:04.368
Essentially, that's our society's way of 
fighting. That's the sanctioned or approved way

28:05.129 --> 28:08.572
of fighting in this culture. And I thought that if 
there was something I didn't believe in or

28:09.673 --> 28:18.182
something that I wanted to change that I felt was 
unfair, the courts were a way of doing it. Are you

28:19.732 --> 28:22.235
satisfied with the role you played in the 
movement? If you could, would you change

28:22.936 --> 28:24.578
anything? If I could, I would have liked to have 
stayed. Well, if I could have done anything

28:30.065 --> 28:38.756
differently, I would have liked to have been able 
to spend even more time trying to get more students

28:30.065 --> 28:38.756
involved, more people involved. There was just a 
limit on time and facilities. But I wish I could

28:43.162 --> 28:48.709
have gotten even more students

28:43.162 --> 28:48.709
involved. That's all the questions I have right 
now. Do you feel that there's anything I've left

28:52.057 --> 28:54.740
out that you consider? I

28:54.780 --> 29:12.882
guess in terms of...

28:54.780 --> 29:12.882
One of the things that you might think about or that 
I think is important is how that affected people,

28:54.780 --> 29:12.882
you know, today. I mean, how their activities in 
the movement affected them. And I think that it had

29:16.178 --> 29:18.181
an effect. It made people realize that they could 
do something about governmental policies they

29:18.942 --> 29:24.328
could band together and speak out. And I think a lot 
of people who were involved in anti-war

29:25.009 --> 29:37.225
activities went on to things like the Sierra Club, 
environmental type activities, civil rights

29:25.009 --> 29:37.225
activities or women's issues. that a lot of areas 
of the law, especially being a lawyer, I can see

29:37.762 --> 29:50.339
that a lot of areas of the law that just literally 
did not exist in the late 60s are now recognized by

29:37.762 --> 29:50.339
the courts. And I think it changed the American 
legal scene in terms of people learned that they

29:50.419 --> 29:58.670
could do something in the system to fight. Do you 
keep in touch with the other eight people that you

29:59.991 --> 30:03.316
were suspended with? Yes, I do. We get together. We 
had a reunion in 79 after 10 years, and we'd see each

30:05.521 --> 30:10.546
other periodically. Most of them still live 
around Austin. And amazingly, even in 69, 79, we

30:13.970 --> 30:30.448
got together, the administration set up a 
policeman with a camera to take pictures

30:13.970 --> 30:30.448
surreptitiously, you know, but he was there on the 
top of the building taking pictures.

30:31.019 --> 30:32.080
Yeah, I keep in touch. We generally get together 
about once a year now, kind of reflect on what's

30:32.100 --> 30:39.609
going on and things like that. In this article, you 
went back to San Marcos in 72 and you said the

30:39.949 --> 30:45.275
students were apathetic. Was it hard for you to 
believe that after all that you'd worked for, you

30:47.117 --> 30:53.865
could come back so soon thereafter and have 
everything so different? Yeah, it was hard to

30:54.225 --> 30:55.947
believe. It was very frustrating because now, at 
that time, students could then vote in 72. And

31:02.350 --> 31:09.320
because of the nature of San Marcos, the size and 
the size of the university, the students could

31:02.350 --> 31:09.320
have dictated the local government. I mean, they 
could have elected a mayor, councilman, a lot. And

31:13.406 --> 31:15.910
students just didn't care about it.
