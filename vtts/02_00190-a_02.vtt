WEBVTT

00:02.917 --> 00:08.265
Did anybody give you any advice what you would 
claim or not claim on your expense account? Well,

00:09.327 --> 00:10.268
you mentioned Perdim. I believe we pretty well 
actually gave. We had to have receipts. As I

00:13.513 --> 00:15.376
recall, we had to have actual expenses. You didn't 
claim just $8, $20 worth today. You had to submit

00:19.623 --> 00:22.427
receipts for most everything. And that's the way, 
I don't even remember if we had per diem versus

00:22.812 --> 00:27.920
just, it was a maximum, I'm sure it was a maximum. 
But did anybody make it clear you couldn't claim

00:28.120 --> 00:30.083
beer? Oh, yeah, yeah, no, you couldn't claim those 
kinds. No drinks, yeah, right. Or parking was a

00:34.651 --> 00:36.994
problem. In those early days, how often did a 
graduate student go along? Oh, well, it wasn't

00:41.942 --> 00:46.509
infrequent. I remember Ed Smith and I going to the 
Valley, to do research on grapefruit, and another

00:50.707 --> 00:55.922
guy and I going to West Texas. Graduate students 
were pretty well integrated into the research

00:55.943 --> 00:58.470
process. Yeah, we used them frequently. And there 
used to be a lot more original data gathering. I

01:02.823 --> 01:04.227
don't know of anybody now who goes out and does 
field survey work. I can't think of anybody doing

01:08.058 --> 01:09.540
that now. Whereas then it was common, 
particularly in the summertime. That's what you

01:11.923 --> 01:13.104
spent your summers doing. You were surveying 
households or you were surveying farmers.

01:16.408 --> 01:17.089
Describe that. That's important. Well, you 
actually went out and did a survey like you did

01:17.890 --> 01:21.654
house to house schedules. If you're doing dairy 
consumption, you would go to Stephenville or

01:22.135 --> 01:26.680
someplace and take a survey. You know, dear madam, 
may I interview you? I've got this questionnaire.

01:30.525 --> 01:31.446
How much milk do you buy in a week and how do you use it 
and blah blah blah. Primary data right from the

01:35.124 --> 01:37.289
consumer. Now most of our data comes from 
secondary sources. How would you have selected,

01:41.479 --> 01:49.097
in such a survey, how would you have selected this 
town instead of some other town? depending on what

01:49.803 --> 01:58.314
the study was, but you'd try to find a 
representative quote-unquote town, and then

01:49.803 --> 01:58.314
within that town, you'd do a sample, either from 
the phone book or the city directory or something.

01:58.334 --> 02:02.981
You could do a sample or a stratified sample, so it 
supposedly was representative. But you actually

02:03.001 --> 02:04.262
went door-to-door. And the same thing with 
producers, farmers. Like up in some county in, you

02:06.245 --> 02:17.080
know, West Texas or wherever, they would do a 
sample of farmers to find out what their

02:06.245 --> 02:17.080
production practices were, and you went 
head-to-head with the farmer. Do you remember any

02:18.001 --> 02:19.523
interesting... Response you got from a on a survey 
conversation No, people were pretty

02:19.857 --> 02:27.750
cooperative. I don't know producer told you it was 
none of your business I Didn't because I wasn't

02:27.790 --> 02:41.713
doing production Surveys, but I can remember 
getting that response from marketing firms I mean

02:27.790 --> 02:41.713
sometimes they'd like to get told you the guy about 
ran me out of his office and Or they simply said,

02:42.031 --> 02:44.033
we're not interested in cooperating. That's our 
business, not yours. And so you just left those

02:47.037 --> 02:48.779
people alone. When you or someone was doing that, 
from what institution or what organization did

02:49.480 --> 02:57.870
you all identify yourself as being? What did you 
say you were from? Well, we'd be from the Texas

02:59.953 --> 03:05.299
Agricultural Experiment Station, was who was 
funding that research. And then we had some kind of

03:06.441 --> 03:10.165
ID, I don't know, a card or a letter, How soon did you 
mention Texas A&M? Oh, right up front, first

03:12.827 --> 03:14.368
thing. And what was their reaction? Usually very 
favorable. Yeah, if A&M had a good image, yeah. And

03:21.496 --> 03:25.520
did anybody before you went out suggest how you 
should dress? Well, we sort of, yeah. Yes, that was

03:28.042 --> 03:36.351
made clear, if you didn't understand it, that you 
dressed very professionally, and probably with a

03:28.042 --> 03:36.351
tie on, depending on the time. Even in the summer, I 
suppose you'd have a tie on. Probably a name tag

03:38.647 --> 03:41.752
that would identify you. How soon after you 
arrived here did you have some results of some of

03:41.772 --> 03:51.808
that field work that made you feel good? Published 
or paper or read or something or other? Well,

03:55.874 --> 04:04.468
within a, I know with, let's see, I believe it was 
the first summer I was here, we did a big foray to the

03:55.874 --> 04:04.468
valley to work on marketing orders. And we used to 
publish what are called departmental reports.

04:09.425 --> 04:12.529
And then generally, hopefully, those would 
evolve into a journal article. So I believe by that

04:13.130 --> 04:17.134
fall, I had something worked up. We had a good 
experience in the valley with the fruits and

04:17.154 --> 04:20.178
vegetable people. And I believe I had something 
worked up on carrots.

04:25.845 --> 04:26.846
Maybe it took as long as a year. The pressure wasn't 
as great then to get things, get them out. And of

04:31.752 --> 04:33.173
course, it wasn't as fast either. They didn't have 
computers. It was six copies of everything if you

04:34.925 --> 04:39.111
wanted to copy something with carbons and so on. 
But things moved slower. Everybody moves more

04:41.655 --> 04:45.060
slowly in terms of getting things published. It 
took longer. And so I would say within a, I think I

04:46.462 --> 04:54.914
got satisfaction probably within the first six 
months or so in terms of, yeah, this is probably

04:46.462 --> 04:54.914
worthwhile, what we're doing here. And when did 
you first do something that Ty Tim or somebody in a

04:55.755 --> 05:03.987
position of responsibility patted you on the 
back, or maybe in the pocketbook too. Well, that

05:07.588 --> 05:23.026
would have been the trip to the valley where we met 
with the powers that be down there, mostly big

05:07.588 --> 05:23.026
producers and some of the marketing people, the 
packers, and talked to them about their situation

05:07.588 --> 05:23.026
as far as the marketing orders went and how 
important they were. I remember we had a big

05:23.046 --> 05:26.110
meeting at some big motel in McAllen and it was well 
attended and we put on a slide show and so on and I got

05:26.309 --> 05:53.059
the impression that they were I was told that we did 
a good job and they were favorably impressed and

05:26.309 --> 05:53.059
that sort of was a good launching pad but it was it 
was a it was a dog and pony show is what it was it

05:26.309 --> 05:53.059
wasn't a professional session or anything and at 
the end of that first semester do you remember any

05:26.309 --> 05:53.059
kind of evaluation or no no well I say no, but I'm not 
sure. It seems like forever we passed out these

05:55.671 --> 06:04.586
sheets, one through ten, where people rated you on 
about 18 things, but I don't know if they ever went

05:55.671 --> 06:04.586
to anybody. You just passed them out for your own 
amusement, and it wasn't until many, many years

06:04.786 --> 06:15.624
later that they started actual formal 
evaluations where they went with your packet to be

06:04.786 --> 06:15.624
reviewed by the head. Did Dr. Tim in the early 
years... Did he ever call you in and give you an

06:21.845 --> 06:28.134
evaluation, tell you what you were doing well or 
not so well? Yeah, I believe he did that about once a

06:28.775 --> 06:30.397
year. He'd have a session that kind of told you what 
they thought was going on. I remember McNeely

06:36.325 --> 06:42.614
called me in one time, and I had begun to work with 
Marshall Godwin came in from Florida. He was a hot

06:42.674 --> 06:46.519
item, and we'd set up a little... camp down in the 
corner of the building, Lonnie Jones and Marshall

06:47.360 --> 06:54.675
Goddard and myself and somebody else, and he was 
going to lead us into big things in marketing. But

06:56.579 --> 06:59.384
we weren't moving very fast. I remember McNeely 
called me in and kind of chewed on me once, which was

06:59.404 --> 07:09.064
good for me because I should have had that from the 
start, that we're not getting enough done here and

06:59.404 --> 07:09.064
so on and so forth. And so that was a good reprimand. 
Not reprimand so much as encouragement, I guess

07:14.232 --> 07:18.836
you'd say. Describe this man, Ty Tim. Ty Tim from 
Hallisville, Texas, raised by his aunts, as I

07:22.419 --> 07:37.313
recall, a kind of a bear of a man, very gregarious, 
garrulous, hail-hardy, well-met fellow. all

07:37.951 --> 07:39.813
smiling all the time. And I've heard Ty say, I'll 
take care of you right after I take care of myself.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.042
Only half in jest, I think. Everybody, I think, 
loved Ty. At least you liked Ty, whether you liked

07:50.145 --> 07:52.548
what he was doing. He got his doctorate of public 
administration at Harvard, which I think he

07:53.730 --> 08:03.642
always kind of felt slightly second class because 
he didn't have a PhD. But he wanted you to know that

08:03.662 --> 08:05.764
he had this degree from Harvard Maybe he even had a 
master's of public administration from Harvard.

08:09.687 --> 08:12.310
But he was an operator. I know when I first got here 
the first summer, I got to teach ag policy to a bunch

08:13.752 --> 08:19.419
of guys who were older than I was. I was 28 years old. 
No, 29 at that time. And because Ty wanted to go to

08:24.425 --> 08:28.029
Colorado, where it was cool. And he did. And I did. 
But he would take care of you. He took care of you.

08:32.963 --> 08:36.709
And then he got in this deal in the Common Market, so 
he went to Europe. I don't know how many times he

08:36.729 --> 08:42.858
went to Europe on this Common Market operation, 
but he was a good friend of Earl Rudder. I'm not sure

08:43.680 --> 08:44.741
what class. I think President Rudder was younger 
than Ty was. They were both in the 30s someplace,

08:50.470 --> 08:52.894
class of 30-something. And Lupo was a good friend 
of Ty's, and so he would be around once in a while.

08:59.444 --> 09:00.726
But Ty was... He was a nice fellow, and he was very 
hospitable, very Texan. He reminded me a lot.

09:06.929 --> 09:10.633
Lyndon Johnson reminded me of Ty, the best parts of 
Lyndon Johnson. You know, he'd almost embrace

09:11.033 --> 09:13.636
you. And so I have fond memories of Ty. I think he 
took pretty good care of you. Did you and your

09:20.643 --> 09:24.407
colleagues have the impression that he was in 
charge? Oh, yeah, yeah, no question about it in

09:24.988 --> 09:28.131
those times. Ty was the head. Within the school of 
agriculture, it would have been before the

09:31.064 --> 09:49.070
university, within the school of agriculture, 
what status did you all think we had among the

09:31.064 --> 09:49.070
department?

09:49.090 --> 09:49.410
Well,

10:10.400 --> 10:31.664
I never went to the library and checked the 
salaries of all these other departments to see who

10:10.400 --> 10:31.664
was doing better, but we were sort of the social 
science, we were the social science of

10:10.400 --> 10:31.664
agriculture, and not being a tech department is 
not always, I don't think you're always

10:10.400 --> 10:31.664
appreciated as much by other tech departments as a 
social science department. So I'm not sure how

10:31.684 --> 10:36.289
others felt about him, but I think he did, given who 
he was and where he was and who he represented, I

10:36.860 --> 10:38.362
thought he did a pretty good job. Let me say this. He 
liked for you to go through channels, because I

10:38.922 --> 10:48.813
remember the day that Snow White, who was a 
graduate student in the third floor restroom, I

10:38.922 --> 10:48.813
was in it. There were four restrooms in the Ag 
building, one female restroom on the basement

10:49.493 --> 10:55.159
floor. And this was in the mid to late 60s. And Snow 
White and her friends came into this restroom and

10:57.301 --> 11:02.827
said, we're going to take this to the women. And 
they did. and

11:03.809 --> 11:26.472
eventually became

11:03.809 --> 11:26.472
a female rescue, but the tie was extremely because 
they didn't go through the channel. They should

11:26.492 --> 11:27.112
have gone through . As with much of A&M. I remember 
that incident. You mentioned salary comparison.

11:28.734 --> 11:29.935
Where in that era could a person have found a 
faculty member Well,

11:30.185 --> 11:36.533
when I got here, I don't think you could find it 
anywhere. I don't know where you would have found

11:36.733 --> 11:44.202
it. It wasn't, you know better than I, but I forget 
when it was. And one time I did go to the library in

11:47.065 --> 11:54.534
the periodical room and look at the budget. And I 
still had trouble figuring out. In agriculture,

11:56.036 --> 11:59.280
because people were paid from two, maybe three 
sources. what their actual compensation

11:59.750 --> 12:13.992
was. But no, in the early days, unless somebody 
told you, you didn't know what. I think the only

12:17.618 --> 12:20.583
place was at the state library. Was it? All right. 
In those early years, you were paid from the

12:23.568 --> 12:24.789
teaching budget. I got two checks. Literally two 
different sections. One from TA and C, and one from

12:29.780 --> 12:34.607
TAX. But not the extension? No, I wasn't 
interested. Very few people, when I got here, I

12:39.814 --> 12:43.860
don't know anybody who had a three-way 
appointment. There may have been other times.

12:46.784 --> 12:52.251
Everybody was either teaching, most were 
teaching research, and then you were extension.

12:52.889 --> 12:54.210
You weren't both. Now, over time, some people 
began to carry a little bit

12:54.230 --> 13:06.221
of extension, and then some extension people 
began to carry teaching positions, joints. And

13:06.241 --> 13:19.293
there may be some now that

13:06.241 --> 13:19.293
are all free, but they wouldn't be free. I think Tom 
and I can be all free. So, you know, early in the

13:20.013 --> 13:21.555
year, what would have been the average 
percentage? One-third or one-third? Yeah,

13:23.416 --> 13:40.216
as I recall, yeah. And mostly, we mostly 
researched. Speaking, we had, well, I forget how

13:40.917 --> 13:42.058
many courses we had. I'd like to check, but most 
everybody just taught one or two courses. When

13:43.480 --> 13:45.542
you, in the early years, when you got here and then 
two years after, describe as many as you have.

13:53.622 --> 14:19.275
Vice

13:53.622 --> 14:19.275
President of University of Florida. .

14:45.614 --> 14:48.897
Gosh, you've caught me here because I know they're 
there. I just can't. Well, but what about some of

14:49.598 --> 14:52.961
these other longtime, Bob Branson, describe him. 
Well, Bob came here. Bob was a Harvard man, SMU at

14:54.802 --> 14:56.984
Harvard. And Bob is a workaholic. He is in 
marketing. And he's always doing this. He still is

15:04.231 --> 15:12.218
in his 80s working, doing surveys, working with 
savings and loans or real estate people. Or at that

15:12.418 --> 15:14.220
time, he was working with marketing companies. 
with firms, with grocery stores, with packers and

15:14.504 --> 15:17.968
shippers. And Bob stayed here the whole time. Bob 
was not all that big on publishing, at least in the

15:20.812 --> 15:26.439
journals, but he got a lot of reports out. But he 
just loved to do those kind of studies. He was an

15:29.323 --> 15:30.805
interesting individual. And is still active, 
even though he's been retired, I guess, 10 years or

15:31.746 --> 15:36.332
more, maybe more. McNeely, John McNeely was head 
of research John was from North Dakota. I remember

15:45.374 --> 15:52.501
he used to make the statement that a lot of good ag 
economists came out of North Dakota because

15:45.374 --> 15:52.501
people would do almost anything to get out of North 
Dakota. But he's right. There was a

15:53.042 --> 15:58.007
disproportionate number of noted agricultural 
economists came out of the Dakotas. And John was

15:59.188 --> 16:01.830
the research head, and he published some. He was in 
marketing. But he stayed here the rest of his

16:04.333 --> 16:06.014
career. Pat Wooten was graduate teaching. I don't 
think Pat I don't think Pat published much at all.

16:13.104 --> 16:16.608
He just did the graduate teaching stuff and taught 
himself. J.C. Grady came here from Missouri as

16:17.869 --> 16:26.459
head of the undergraduate section, and he was 
leader of that for years and taught. Now, he was

16:26.479 --> 16:29.503
probably the closest thing we had to a full-time 
teacher.

16:32.867 --> 16:37.212
Peter Berry came through here and is now a fellow in 
the association, but he's at Illinois. A lot of,

16:38.103 --> 16:41.228
you know, I can't recall all these names. Jim 
Hildreth

16:41.648 --> 16:56.532
came here from Illinois and quickly became 
associate director of the Experiment Station and

16:41.648 --> 16:56.532
then went to the Farm Foundation in Chicago, and 
he's been there ever since, retired some time

16:41.648 --> 16:56.532
back. He was a well-known economist. One of the 
names you mentioned a while ago, legendary, was

16:59.456 --> 17:04.003
this man Reagan Brown. Reagan Brown, yes. Scribe 
Reagan Brown. Reagan Brown, I mean, he had the best

17:06.757 --> 17:09.379
stories. I'm not sure what the content of Reagan's 
speeches were, but he was constant

17:10.340 --> 17:16.446
entertainment. He was the most entertaining 
speaker I think I've ever heard as far as humor

17:16.466 --> 17:25.615
goes, and not second and patriotic either in terms 
of putting on a patriotic show. Reagan was a rural

17:26.436 --> 17:36.325
sociologist,

17:26.436 --> 17:36.325
which was interesting that he would be in 
sociology because I think most people thought

17:26.436 --> 17:36.325
sociology was a bit of a liberal field. But he was a 
real sociologist, probably may have had a

17:36.997 --> 17:42.303
master's degree, may have had a master's degree, 
I'm not sure. But he was the ultimate Texan, very

17:43.224 --> 17:51.373
straight-laced, and could tell stories ad 
infinitum. And a helpful guy, cordial. And he was a

17:55.438 --> 17:59.703
good emcee, emceed lots of things around here. 
You'll recall that Hal Brown emceed something

17:59.763 --> 18:03.527
Reagan was supposed to. But he was legendary. Was 
he helpful as a colleague? Well, I never dealt with

18:08.667 --> 18:14.035
anything in rural sociology, so I didn't deal with 
him directly. There was a rural sociology section

18:15.457 --> 18:21.746
within the sociology part of our department. And 
then later, of course, sociology moved out. But,

18:23.809 --> 18:26.072
yeah, if you wanted help, But again, I think 
probably I suffered career-wise from not going to

18:26.558 --> 18:32.447
people, not knowing enough to go to people for 
help. I just did my own thing. But I never found

18:34.170 --> 18:39.358
anybody who wasn't helpful of the Texan-type 
staff. Who became your closest departmental

18:39.518 --> 18:45.287
buddies in the 60s, in the early years? Well, there 
was a guy named Jim Graves who's now at Texas Tech

18:45.387 --> 18:48.852
and is retired. And that was partly because we were 
about the same age and our children were similar

18:48.992 --> 18:53.359
ages. Jim was a buddy. Rod Martin, who is a 
production economist. It used to be, in the old

18:58.341 --> 19:16.630
days, when the government had more money, the 
federal government, that...

19:17.099 --> 19:40.905
Lonnie

19:17.099 --> 19:40.905
Jones, who's still in our faculty, he's a little 
younger than I am, was a good friend. He was in

19:40.925 --> 19:41.566
marketing at the time. And our families were 
similar. And that was in the early days. Those guys

19:42.847 --> 19:44.529
and other, well, Russell Pops and Hal Brown, but 
Hal wasn't here at home. And Russell wasn't here a

19:44.549 --> 19:45.410
whole lot longer. Of the faculty that are close to 
Lonnie. And that, I'm sure, means something else.

19:47.457 --> 20:09.738
Of course,

19:47.457 --> 20:09.738
then I got to meet, fortunately, historians and 
other people whom we became good or better friends

19:47.457 --> 20:09.738
with. And in those early years, what was your 
normal daily routine? What time did you get to the

20:11.600 --> 20:12.781
office, lunch, and go to work? Well, you needed to 
be at the office pretty close to 8 o'clock. That was

20:14.082 --> 20:14.582
expected. And you could take an hour for lunch, but 
you better be there... Pretty much till 12 and

20:16.904 --> 20:21.897
start again at 1 and be there till 5. In fact, there 
was a whistle. There was a whistle on the water

20:24.304 --> 20:26.771
tower. I remember the mill whistle when I was a kid 
growing up. There was a row of mills in my home town.

20:31.884 --> 20:33.208
It made honeydew flowers. And there

20:34.015 --> 20:49.154
was a whistle. It would blow at 8, it would blow at 
12, it would blow at 1, it would blow at 5. And it was

20:50.796 --> 20:51.417
the same thing here. On the water tower, there was a 
big steam gun whistle. Did you and other faculty

20:52.538 --> 20:53.599
members watch that whistle? Well, being 
sophisticated intellectuals, we felt that was a

20:53.619 --> 20:56.523
bit mundane and beneath us to have to pay attention 
to the whistle, which we didn't. But we were there

20:56.543 --> 20:57.384
from 8 to 12 and 1 to 5. Do you remember if anybody 
ever heard of it?

21:08.812 --> 21:31.644
Oh,

21:08.812 --> 21:31.644
yeah. When I got here.

21:48.822 --> 21:54.508
In those early years, did you and your colleagues 
take coffee breaks? Yeah, we did. There was a

21:56.331 --> 22:06.702
coffee room on the third floor of the building on 
the south end, and we did go meet frequently there.

22:06.722 --> 22:10.667
It wasn't formal or anything, but then that was 
mostly the research teaching guys. The extension

22:10.707 --> 22:17.935
guys would get in the car or cars and drive over to 
the Ramada Inn and drink their coffee. Once in a

22:18.674 --> 22:20.496
while, we'd walk over to the MSC. Of course, the 
campus wasn't crowded then. There was no problem.

22:23.981 --> 22:26.464
In fact, I don't remember even having a parking 
sticker when I first got here. You just drove up and

22:27.906 --> 22:29.268
parked where you wanted to. But yeah, there was 
more collegiality then in terms of coffee breaks

22:29.909 --> 22:35.816
than there are now. In fact, we used to have a 
seminar. I don't know if you remember this, but

22:37.859 --> 22:44.087
this was interdepartmental at the YMCA. There was 
a seminar once a week, and And some people talked

22:47.294 --> 22:49.216
about their discipline. Some people talked about 
the sailboats. I mean, Ed Doran over in

22:51.759 --> 22:55.984
meteorology talked about sailing. Somebody 
else, I talked about carrots. John Tracy talked

22:59.568 --> 23:01.791
about whatever he wanted to. And that was a good 
thing. But that wasn't a coffee break. That was a

23:04.995 --> 23:07.077
seminar once a week. And isn't that what we call the 
brown bag seminar? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I thought it

23:10.861 --> 23:14.325
was. How did you get back and forth from the campus? 
Well, let's see. I think I got a bicycle almost

23:19.331 --> 23:24.958
immediately, which was not unique. But it was 
almost unique. When we moved here, we lived on

23:27.561 --> 23:34.671
Nagel, about four blocks from the campus north in 
Bryan. And so I got a 10-speed bicycle, ancient

23:36.113 --> 23:43.162
Schwinn, bought from somebody west of town. And I 
rode that thing to work. Because we only had one

23:46.677 --> 23:47.878
car. And if you only had one car, then your wife 
couldn't go anywhere if you had the car at work. So I

23:51.663 --> 23:55.307
rode the bike and have almost ever since. Now, 
surely you had some interesting experiences in

23:55.627 --> 24:03.536
certain days of weather with your suit. Well, 
yeah, you had to wear a raincoat. Or if it was really

24:05.378 --> 24:07.741
bad, then I'd get Peggy to bring me to work. But, 
yeah. Yeah, you had to watch out for the weather. It

24:11.858 --> 24:16.003
seems to me like, I may be wrong, it used to rain a lot 
more down here than it does now. It was humid in the

24:16.103 --> 24:18.726
summer and the wintertime, but not. And where was 
the parking lot for the agriculture building?

24:24.272 --> 24:25.213
Right behind it. I mean, you didn't have to spend 
much time going from your car to the building.

24:31.180 --> 24:36.847
Describe the diversity of the faculty of the 
department. You mean what I got here? Mm-hmm.

24:38.450 --> 24:39.472
Well, it wasn't real diverse. I'm trying to think 
that... Now, of course, Ty had a degree from

24:40.393 --> 24:44.279
somewhere else. The Head did, and Branson did, and 
I imagine McNeely did. He probably from North

24:51.069 --> 24:52.171
Dakota. But most people had their degrees from 
Texas A&M. It was not real diverse. What about

24:57.739 --> 24:59.642
their ethnic diversity? Oh, all-white male, 
period. I mean, that was all-white male... Now,

25:08.335 --> 25:10.177
Stelly was a Cajun. Randall Stelly from 
Louisiana. What was his specialty? He was milk

25:16.644 --> 25:17.965
marketing. He was a dairy marketing specialist. 
And were there any internationally born?

25:27.015 --> 25:27.915
Internationally born? No. Somebody from outside 
the U.S.? No. They were all U.S. nationals from

25:29.938 --> 25:32.120
birth? And as far as you can recall, all U.S. 
degrees? Yes. And about how many, what was the

25:36.348 --> 25:43.836
percentage of PhDs, you reckon? Well, it would be 
low. 50-50? No, no, not nearly that high. No, I

25:50.463 --> 25:52.345
would say maybe. Of course, the question, well, 
how do you figure the faculty? Do you figure the

25:55.128 --> 25:57.251
extension guys in there or what? But of the whole, 
what we would consider when we had a faculty

25:57.311 --> 26:06.000
meeting, which would include the extension 
people, I would think not more than a fourth. at

26:06.149 --> 26:08.011
that time, if that many. In a departmental 
discussion, was there any obvious difference in

26:08.711 --> 26:26.247
the prestige clout of those that were extension 
primarily compared with those that were teaching

26:08.711 --> 26:26.247
and research? Well, in fact, I don't think so. We 
may have thought so because we had degrees, but The

26:35.545 --> 26:49.120
extension guys were the older, been in the Hornets 
longer, probably had more pull than did the

26:35.545 --> 26:49.120
younger so-called degreed faculty at that time. 
But, you know, people in research teaching

26:49.560 --> 26:55.727
probably thought they were more important than 
extension and vice versa. But I didn't notice any,

26:55.787 --> 26:58.870
there's always been a little, what do you call it, 
between Extension and the research teaching

27:00.014 --> 27:04.780
people. I think it's gotten less over the years 
because we've gotten more joint appointments.

27:09.987 --> 27:15.794
But the Extension guys thought they were doing 
more applied, more practical work than the

27:09.987 --> 27:15.794
research teachers. In those early days, do you 
remember any big departmental decision that

27:15.814 --> 27:25.026
there was a lot of pulling and tugging on and how it 
finally came out?

27:28.634 --> 27:43.977
Oh, well, we had some big departmental studies, 
but I don't recall, you know, I probably will when

27:28.634 --> 27:43.977
you leave, but anything of momentous, like name 
change wasn't an issue then. Now, today, it's name

27:43.997 --> 27:45.479
change. What should we change our name to? Not 
then, that wasn't a problem. I don't know how the

27:50.527 --> 27:55.975
decision was made to separate sociology from 
agricultural economics. never entered my realm.

28:00.238 --> 28:01.960
So offhand, no, I don't. What was the departmental 
reaction to the campus decision to admit women and

28:03.002 --> 28:16.322
non-compulsory core and racial integration and 
broaden the curriculum and change the name of the

28:03.002 --> 28:16.322
institution?

28:18.785 --> 28:23.672
Well, I think that most of it was welcomed. I think 
we were quote, academic enough that we identified

28:26.330 --> 28:30.517
with the needs to do that. And I'm not sure if you 
talk to the old timers. Like, I don't know what

28:33.622 --> 28:34.964
Reagan's position. It'd be interesting to know 
what Reagan's position would have been on that,

28:34.984 --> 28:38.470
Reagan Brown. But I think they almost realized the 
necessity, if this place was going to stay in

28:38.490 --> 28:50.550
business, as sort of like President Rudder 
presented it, that we had to do that. And

28:50.570 --> 28:51.932
welcoming... Yeah, I think most of them welcomed 
it. You'll remember the aspiration study of 62,

28:56.425 --> 29:01.814
which some of us actually read. I think most of the 
faculty were fairly progressive on that. When we

29:07.203 --> 29:17.380
got our first faculty female, we were not as 
supportive of her as we should, and the old dip in

29:17.495 --> 29:22.300
redneck cowboy contingent of the student body, I 
think almost literally ran her off. She was just

29:23.020 --> 29:23.741
not accepted. About when was that, do you know? Oh, 
I'm trying to, I really, I remember her name was

29:25.703 --> 29:32.049
Judy, and I can't think of Judy's last name. That 
had to be, what, early 70s, late 60s, or maybe early

29:33.831 --> 29:39.757
70s. How long was she here? Not long, two, three 
years. Yeah, not long. And she was teaching one of

29:44.852 --> 29:46.995
the toughest courses, too. So I don't think that 
was done on purpose. But she just, well, there were

29:49.418 --> 29:53.504
some yahoos in there. And as I recall, that was a 
rumor that she just couldn't take it. And I can

29:57.730 --> 29:58.952
believe that. You mean these were students? 
Students, yeah, students. Not the faculty, but

30:01.215 --> 30:02.637
students. How did the faculty treat her? Well, as I 
recall, she was treated okay. I mean, I don't

30:09.687 --> 30:12.190
remember any disparaging behavior. Did she, as 
far as you know, did she complain about the way the

30:13.452 --> 30:18.619
department treated her ever? Well, not to me. I 
mean, I didn't hear it. She may have, who knows? I

30:24.106 --> 30:25.167
don't know. Not that I know of. It's been a long 
time. All right, let's go back. In your first, the

30:31.155 --> 30:37.283
first courses that you teach, what was your 
impression of Aggie students? Well, you know,

30:38.663 --> 30:40.606
relative to what? Because I hadn't taught. I had 
been an instructor to a little extent at Penn

30:42.249 --> 30:46.717
State. And my impression of students were they 
were mostly core at that time. They were

30:53.730 --> 31:01.043
respectful, courteous, not necessarily all 
valedictorians, but they were well-behaved. And

31:02.052 --> 31:06.140
at that time, of course, most of them were 
well-dressed and well-kempt. It wasn't the

31:06.220 --> 31:09.526
Vietnam thing had not come along then. Not that 
that mattered much at this point down here. But

31:14.074 --> 31:22.650
easy to deal with, not close to the faculty in the 
sense of none of the buddy-buddy stuff, you know.

31:22.670 --> 31:23.672
They pretty well...
