WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:09.832
a little bit about you and your history, and what 
year did you begin reporting and anchoring? In

00:11.293 --> 00:13.796
Houston, essentially, I started in 1961. I came 
here. Dan Rather was at Channel 11 at that time, and

00:15.818 --> 00:19.061
I was in Tulsa. And they brought two people down 
from the Tulsa station to work down here, and I was

00:19.962 --> 00:25.768
one of the people brought down. He was my boss. And 
he became famous, of course, with Carla. And that

00:30.862 --> 00:32.844
was in September. In May the following year, he 
left to go to CBS. And so I worked with him for that

00:36.648 --> 00:40.071
period of time and learned a great deal from him 
about writing. But there were essentially three

00:40.551 --> 00:50.501
news stations in town, KPRC, Channel 2, KHOU, 
Channel 11, KTRK, Channel 13. Channel 8 was on the

00:52.543 --> 00:55.026
air, but that was it. And 8 didn't do any news. So 
there were three news stations. And 2 was the

00:58.169 --> 00:59.670
dominant station. until the hurricane came, put 
Rather on the map, but also put Eleven on the map.

01:05.444 --> 01:09.250
And Eleven stayed number one for, I'd say, about 
eight or ten years. Then 13's dominance came into

01:09.730 --> 01:18.302
play and remains there now, though we're just 
about to beat them, and I think we probably will. If

01:19.223 --> 01:21.126
we don't get them now, we'll get them very shortly. 
What year did Channel 2 begin operation?

01:27.415 --> 01:29.978
I think 2 is 35 years old, so I think... I think they 
were on the air in the 50s, something like that. But

01:34.150 --> 01:35.713
I'm not really sure. Not very many viewers, not 
many people had TV. No, that was a situation where

01:38.237 --> 01:52.460
traditionally the NBC station was the first 
station in the market because NBC radio had a kind

01:38.237 --> 01:52.460
of dominance, and RCA was making electronics 
equipment for television, so they stocked NBC

01:38.237 --> 01:52.460
stations first. And people would go down to the 
supermarkets or not supermarket, to the store,

01:56.992 --> 02:02.040
like a Foley store, and look in the window. You'd 
see them gathered around the front window to watch

02:02.260 --> 02:05.105
television. It was a very unique situation. Then 
pretty soon got to where everybody got one of their

02:07.930 --> 02:10.714
house, then color came. First the cable came to 
bring you live programs, and then color came, and

02:11.175 --> 02:18.306
then now VCRs, and the industry keeps changing. 
One of the reasons it's been interesting, it's

02:18.386 --> 02:20.690
been a very fluid industry. It always changes. It 
may seem to be the same to the guy at home, But

02:24.380 --> 02:26.242
internally, it's changing every day. You can't 
keep up with it. What kind of stories would I see if I

02:28.704 --> 02:32.588
were a viewer in 1960? Same kind of stories you see 
now, except probably more emphasis on crime,

02:32.648 --> 02:39.294
because crime's easier to do. The reason you see so 
much crime on television and so much crime on

02:39.594 --> 02:46.821
radio, and essentially so much crime in 
newspapers, is because it's an easy thing to

02:39.594 --> 02:46.821
cover. There's a body. There's a police car. 
There's a light going around that attracts people

02:49.764 --> 02:52.446
to it. There are people around gathering. 
Everybody's got an idea as to what happened or what

02:54.915 --> 02:59.441
might have happened, whether it was an automobile 
accident or a shooting or a robbery. Well, crime

02:59.461 --> 03:03.026
may be visual, but is the crime rate increasing? 
Crime rate increases, I think, with the general

03:03.046 --> 03:05.610
population. I think that is a fact. And there 
probably is more crime now than there was in the

03:08.614 --> 03:12.640
1950s because there are more of us. And certainly 
in Houston, there's more crime because we have

03:13.141 --> 03:20.792
created a, I don't know what you want to call it, 
that we've created down there. When I came to

03:20.832 --> 03:22.534
Houston in 1961, there 600,000, 700,000 people. 
Now you've got in that same tight area that's

03:25.718 --> 03:31.044
uninhabitable. Anybody who had any sense 
wouldn't live there in the first place because

03:31.264 --> 03:34.568
it's not a fit place to live. Too hot. It's too 
everything. So now we've got 3 million people in

03:38.312 --> 03:40.355
there. So yes, there's more crime. Television 
didn't do that. Radio didn't do that. News papers

03:43.839 --> 03:44.740
didn't do that. Do you see crime being committed 
more violently than in the 60s? I began as a police

03:51.843 --> 03:59.550
reporter, and I saw people shocked, stabbed, 
choked, and gassed. And I've seen a couple of

03:59.570 --> 04:04.194
people electrocuted in the electric chair. I 
don't see, I don't know that you get more violent

04:04.514 --> 04:06.736
than that. I think because of the perception is, 
because of what television is doing, what mass

04:06.756 --> 04:18.547
media is doing, is that there seems to be a much more 
violent attitude about people now than we always

04:06.756 --> 04:18.547
had. But you have to understand, there's a good 
side to television. maybe, and that is in the

04:22.235 --> 04:27.342
1960s, television may have showed us that war is 
really hell. I mean, MacArthur said it was, and

04:28.203 --> 04:35.212
Harry Truman said it was, but nobody really 
believed that much because it was really John

04:28.203 --> 04:35.212
Wayne, wasn't it? It was what we saw at the movies on 
Saturday. Television brought the living room war

04:38.196 --> 04:45.505
to us, and we haven't had a major confrontation of 
the war since Vietnam. Maybe we won't have. I don't

04:46.226 --> 04:46.587
know. But before that, we had World War II and World 
War I and the Spanish-American War and the Civil

04:46.807 --> 04:51.533
War. And we had inquisitions in Europe, and we had 
seven crusades. And man has not figured out a more

04:57.296 --> 05:01.462
violent way to be than man was then. Excellent. 
Thank you, Roger. You're very welcome, Ron. Yeah,

05:06.190 --> 05:07.452
you're quite welcome. Very historical. Yes.

05:11.739 --> 05:18.088
When you worked there at KPRC in 1960, were there as 
many female reporters then as there are now? No,

05:18.108 --> 05:19.731
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Jessica Savage came in 
the 60s, and I can't recall exactly when she came.

05:27.597 --> 05:30.381
Jessica Savage and Bob Nicholas were both hired 
the same week. Now, that's a significant thing

05:30.401 --> 05:34.647
because Bob Nicholas is black. And Jessica Savage 
is a woman. And the community was pretty much

05:37.712 --> 05:43.641
decided that neither one of them had the right to 
give them the news. I mean, certainly a woman had no

05:43.661 --> 05:46.545
business giving the news. And what year was this? 
Well, sometime in the 60s. I don't know exactly

05:49.871 --> 05:51.794
when it was. 60s, 70s, maybe 70s. I don't know. I 
lose track of time. You know, when you get my age,

05:55.218 --> 05:57.561
things fly by. But in that age, it was very 
controversial. Oh, yeah. You know, Jess did the

06:00.124 --> 06:03.788
Saturday night news. Bob did the Sunday night 
news. And people said, we're never going to watch

06:05.130 --> 06:08.013
your weekends again on Channel 11. That's where it 
was at that time. Because you've got a black man on

06:09.847 --> 06:11.609
there. God knows black people don't have any 
sense. You've got a woman on there. God knows women

06:15.974 --> 06:17.776
don't have any sense. Who hired these? The 
management of the television station at that

06:19.598 --> 06:32.013
time, the Corinthian Broadcasting Company, made 
the decision that the time had come to make a

06:19.598 --> 06:32.013
gigantic leap into modern times and did this. I 
suppose a man named Jim Riddsdale was the man who

06:32.113 --> 06:34.495
did it. The news director was a fellow named Dick 
John. It was a very radical first time. Yes. We got

06:38.939 --> 06:40.200
death threats. We got threats from sponsors that 
they were going to quit watching, going to quit

06:41.241 --> 06:51.031
doing these things, going to quit sponsoring the 
programs. And in the end, of course, it all worked

06:51.091 --> 06:53.634
out very well. Now I think 40% of the newsrooms 
around the country, newspapers and radio and

06:54.434 --> 07:01.882
television stations, are women. They're being 
paid the same amount of money that men are being

07:01.902 --> 07:04.444
paid. They're doing the same kind of jobs. They're 
probably doing it better. which is a terrible

07:08.588 --> 07:22.281
thing to admit, but the fact is they have a sense of 
propriety, a sense of understanding how things go

07:08.588 --> 07:22.281
together in an orderly way, which makes a good 
reporter. A good reporter ought to know how to

07:22.301 --> 07:25.424
orderly put things together. A woman maybe knows 
that instinctively. Maybe God gave them that kind

07:28.307 --> 07:31.490
of instinct to know how to manage things. So 
they're pretty good managers and thus pretty good

07:31.510 --> 07:34.913
reporters. And I want to say they have And forgive 
me for using gutter words, but they've got just as

07:39.520 --> 07:46.391
many balls as men have, and that's a great shock to 
those of us who are men. Is Jan Carson

07:46.411 --> 07:48.614
characteristic of those qualities? Absolutely. 
Absolutely. Yeah, she's tough. She's

07:52.160 --> 07:53.923
attractive. If you want somebody to be 
attractive, she's attractive. She's tough. If

07:56.747 --> 08:02.095
you want somebody to be tough, she can sit down and 
write a news story as well as I can and better. Does

08:03.397 --> 08:07.063
TV emphasize now the glamour? Always have. More 
than it has in the past. Television started in the

08:09.605 --> 08:10.787
beginning. People watched television

08:10.827 --> 08:18.078
not because they thought they were going to learn 
any great new things. They were going to see some

08:18.118 --> 08:23.686
things on the newsreel that they had not 
previously seen, open up the wide vistas that way.

08:23.706 --> 08:27.692
But you had John Cameron Swayze read the Camel News 
Caravan. That was the very first thing. It was just

08:28.954 --> 08:30.737
wonderful. And the guy, I can't think of his name, 
who did CBS, the first CBS newscast now, he's

08:36.389 --> 08:39.432
Robert Kraut, another handsome guy with a 
mustache. People thought that that's the way it

08:40.433 --> 08:46.840
was supposed to be, just an attractive guy sitting 
there reading the news, and that was it. We got past

08:46.860 --> 08:52.405
attractive guys reading the news, but they were 
still accused of flash and trash. But it's still

08:52.425 --> 08:54.948
there, just like it's still there in newspapers. I 
don't suppose the Post or the Chronicle started

08:54.968 --> 09:03.156
putting color in their newspapers because they 
knew that that was going to enhance the value of the

08:54.968 --> 09:03.156
news. They knew that if they put that in there, 
people might pick it up and look at it. It's a

09:06.432 --> 09:07.153
business. It's a business. And television's a 
business, and don't you ever forget that. Don't

09:09.876 --> 09:12.238
let anybody tell you it isn't, because if they tell 
you that, it's a lie. Newspapers are a business. We

09:14.301 --> 09:17.484
don't exist for any other reason than to make 
somebody money. Now, because we can make somebody

09:17.604 --> 09:26.934
money, we also can do things that we ought to be 
doing, and we do things for the community. At our

09:26.954 --> 09:32.740
station, at every television station, they do 
things for the community that the community

09:26.954 --> 09:32.740
doesn't even realize. They run They run spots for 
the Leukemia Society free. It doesn't cost

09:37.052 --> 09:39.816
anything to run those public service 
announcements. That's part of the thing they said

09:39.836 --> 09:43.661
they'd do to get the license. They put fringe 
programs on the air maybe in weird times when no

09:44.322 --> 09:56.117
one's watching, but they put programs on the air 
that give people exposure to how the other half

09:44.322 --> 09:56.117
lives, which is very valuable and very good. 
Newspapers do the same thing. Radio does the same

09:57.339 --> 09:58.320
thing. So you can gripe all you want to about it 
being a business, and we're really in there, oh, we

09:58.975 --> 10:04.041
care about the ratings. You bet. I care about the 
ratings. So I got a good enough rating to get to work

10:06.364 --> 10:08.667
tomorrow. It's as simple a thing as that. The guy 
here at Foley's worries about the ratings, see?

10:14.194 --> 10:15.296
His rating is a cash register. If he sells enough in 
the camera department, he'll get to sell cameras

10:15.656 --> 10:20.643
tomorrow. At Texas A&M, if a teacher teaches well 
enough and produces good enough results from his

10:20.783 --> 10:28.813
classroom, he'll get to teach next year. It's a 
struggle to survive. It's survival of the

10:33.249 --> 10:34.571
fittest. That's what ratings are. I'm old before 
my time because I worry about who watched last

10:35.572 --> 10:39.857
night. I worry about those numbers. I want to know 
when I get to work today what my numbers were last

10:41.139 --> 10:44.163
night. I really want to know. Can those numbers be 
trusted? Are they reliable? Let's assume that you

10:49.329 --> 10:53.054
wanted to play a game of craps. You really want to 
shoot dice somewhere, and there's only one crap

10:53.755 --> 10:57.940
game in town. You're probably going to go and 
someone will say, well, what if they're loaded?

11:02.965 --> 11:04.429
But I don't know whether they're loaded or not. If 
I'm going to play the game, that's the only place to

11:04.489 --> 11:07.598
go to play. The only way you can tell what's 
happening in television is by a ratings thing that

11:07.619 --> 11:13.195
may or may not be loaded. But it's the only way to 
check. Not the best, but the only. It's the only way

11:17.036 --> 11:18.337
anybody's come up with. It'd be really wonderful 
if they could see if you put a little thing on front

11:18.357 --> 11:26.866
of your television set and you turn it on and it 
says, well, somebody was watching Channel 2 last

11:18.357 --> 11:26.866
night. No, it doesn't. It says the television set 
was on Channel 2 last night. It doesn't say whether

11:31.551 --> 11:35.355
they watched. It doesn't say whether they 
listened. It doesn't say whether they learned

11:36.136 --> 11:37.037
anything. We don't know how to measure that. Okay. 
Do you think that TV news directors overemphasize

11:39.989 --> 11:45.394
the graphics and the glamour and the live shots? 
Yeah, they're interested in that sort of thing

11:45.614 --> 11:55.622
because it all goes together in a kind of package 
just like the editor of a newspaper probably

11:45.614 --> 11:55.622
overemphasizes the graphics. At the expense of 
truth in journalism? No, those things don't have

11:59.926 --> 12:03.929
anything to do with each other. If you believe 
that, then that's to say that you couldn't have an

12:04.109 --> 12:09.574
attractive picture of the Pope behind you as 
you're talking about the Pope. and that you

12:09.976 --> 12:13.422
somehow would be cheapening the pulp or 
cheapening the story. That doesn't make a

12:13.762 --> 12:15.024
difference. Graphics are used in every form of 
business, in every form of teaching. There's

12:20.293 --> 12:22.556
always been somebody who had a graph. There's 
always somebody who had a picture to explain how

12:22.977 --> 12:26.262
something worked. If television does the same 
thing, what's wrong with that? It's a teaching

12:30.749 --> 12:31.631
tool. I can say, I did a story the other night about 
the wind shear that the airplane ran into at

12:32.112 --> 12:37.300
Dallas. Well, I know what wind shear was. I mean, 
I've heard the word. Most of my viewers have heard

12:41.065 --> 12:44.129
the word, but they don't know what it is. So the 
artist people did a thing of a down, you know, an

12:44.250 --> 12:47.694
arrow. They did a cloud with an airplane in it and an 
arrow coming down at it like a gust of wind. Now,

12:54.443 --> 12:57.267
that's flash, okay? But it also helps somebody 
say, oh, that's what a wind shear is, a sudden wind

12:57.287 --> 13:04.977
that comes down and hits the front of the airplane 
and makes it crash. Now, The question is, could we

13:06.541 --> 13:08.683
tell the story without it? And the answer is yes. 
The question is, could we tell it as effectively?

13:12.066 --> 13:15.409
And the answer is, maybe not. Well, does it cheapen 
the story and bring it down to an elementary level?

13:22.656 --> 13:27.320
You've got to understand that the average person 
that we're talking to is not a college graduate. Is

13:27.340 --> 13:29.241
that insulting to the average viewer? No, I don't 
think so. It's not insulting to me if someone, if I

13:30.262 --> 13:34.126
pick up something and I say, well, I understand 
that. It doesn't insult me. If I pick up a

13:36.072 --> 13:42.840
newspaper, and I go back to newspapers because I 
read newspapers all the time, lots of newspapers,

13:36.072 --> 13:42.840
and I enjoy them. USA Today doesn't insult me 
because it has a graph telling how many people chew

13:43.021 --> 13:48.027
gum on Thursday. I just think, who cares? But 
somebody does, you see. If the story next to it is a

13:52.672 --> 14:00.923
good story about how the deficit is affecting the 
balance of trade, then that doesn't bother me at

13:52.672 --> 14:00.923
all. And if they have a little graph that shows a 
ship docking and guys carrying stuff off the ship

14:04.085 --> 14:09.333
and putting things back on there as they have done 
to explain what the balance of trade is. It doesn't

14:09.753 --> 14:14.140
insult my intelligence, and it may help somebody 
to understand what this thing's all about. Okay.

14:14.841 --> 14:17.505
Let's draw some differences between newspaper 
and TV. Okay. Does TV suffer from its inadequacy to

14:18.326 --> 14:26.738
reach deep down, bring the details out? Yeah. We 
have a time problem. We have time constraints that

14:29.482 --> 14:31.986
we simply cannot get around. I bet. 30 minutes of 
news. You have a 30-minute segment. How many

14:37.100 --> 14:39.223
minutes of news do you have? 12 to 13 minutes of news 
in it. That's not counting weather and sports and

14:40.985 --> 14:44.149
commercials. That's very small. Oh, yeah. It's 
not very much time at all. So you become an editor,

14:46.832 --> 14:50.737
and you say, I'm going to tell them about this and 
such. You get to play God. That's one of the worst

14:51.819 --> 14:57.185
things about the whole thing, is the producer, 
anchor, gets to play God a little bit. And you go

14:57.586 --> 15:00.349
home every night wondering if you were the right 
kind of God today. All right. Houston, the market

15:04.302 --> 15:11.331
you work in, the 10th-rated market, is the 
competition stiff? Yeah, very much so. Yeah, I

15:12.293 --> 15:12.854
think so. There's a lot of money involved in it. 
See, we make a lot of money in the television

15:14.175 --> 15:16.879
business. And when you've got a lot of money 
involved, you have terrible competition for that

15:16.899 --> 15:28.615
dollar so that you can't afford to let down because 
somebody's after you every time you get a rating

15:16.899 --> 15:28.615
point. If we beat 13, you see, we charge more money 
for what we sell a spot for in that newspaper. We

15:34.031 --> 15:35.793
sell eight spots in it now, see. What are some of the 
magic tricks that producers use to boost the

15:35.813 --> 15:40.559
ratings? Well, they try to put special reports in 
during rating periods, you know, blockbuster

15:40.579 --> 15:52.994
reports on what happened, you know, this story, 
that story, whatever it might be. They try to

15:53.014 --> 15:55.918
infuse as many of those in as they possibly can. get 
promotable things in a newscast, promotable

15:56.303 --> 16:01.211
features in a newscast. Dan Carson is now working 
on a cosmetic surgery piece, which is fluff. But

16:07.301 --> 16:13.752
you know if you advertise the fact that tonight 
we're going to show you a breast implant, you might

16:07.301 --> 16:13.752
get somebody to watch your newscast. Chances are 
you're going to get somebody to watch your

16:14.533 --> 16:17.197
newscast. 13, I mean 11, two years ago during those 
glory days of Amanda Arnold, did a whole

16:24.485 --> 16:28.611
month-long series on sexual attitudes in 
Houston. We knew everybody's sexual attitude. I

16:30.855 --> 16:31.616
couldn't care less. But I had a lot of people say, 
what do you think about the way 50-year-old women

16:31.676 --> 16:35.101
think about sex? And I'd say, what? You watch for 
that? And they'd say, well, sure. I wanted to know.

16:39.488 --> 16:46.058
And I'm thinking, oh, it'd be a shoe sale.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.606
Well, that gets back to the viewers. and their 
response to the news. Why do you think some viewers

16:53.393 --> 17:01.666
think TV news blows stories out of proportion? 
Because in the first place, it's very personal. It

17:04.670 --> 17:06.112
comes into their house, and they see it. If they see 
the story on, let's assume there was, let's shoot

17:06.633 --> 17:13.864
somebody at a school, OK? 2, 11, 13 are going to 
shoot somebody, they're going to have a film on

17:15.093 --> 17:22.300
that at 5 o'clock, 6 o'clock, 10 o'clock. Okay? The 
numbers. So, you know, they have, maybe they've

17:23.701 --> 17:27.485
blown it out of proportion. Maybe it shouldn't 
have been that big a story in the first place. But

17:29.787 --> 17:30.368
it's the story. In Philadelphia last night at a 
shopping mall, a woman dressed in army fatigues

17:31.088 --> 17:38.195
walks in with a gun and starts shooting. She shoots 
13 or 14 people and kills two of them. That's going

17:40.597 --> 17:43.480
to be on every television station in 
Philadelphia. and in every newspaper in

17:44.354 --> 17:49.085
Philadelphia for a couple of days, and it's going 
to be an overkill kind of a situation. So there you

17:49.105 --> 17:50.728
go. I've got to go do my work here. Oh, okay. Okay. 
Can I come back in a second? I think that wraps it up.

18:00.270 --> 18:01.613
Yeah, that's fine. Great. Thank you very much.
