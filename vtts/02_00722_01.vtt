00:02.377 --> 00:12.808
Tell us something about your early life, 
including the names of your parents, the dates of

00:02.377 --> 00:12.808
their birth and death, and the place of their birth 
and death, if you know them. If you don't know them,

00:12.828 --> 00:15.671
that's OK, too. And where they were born, where you 
were born, and the schools you went to before you

00:15.691 --> 00:22.979
went to A&M. Well, now, do I start off by saying my 
name is Thaddeus Ansley? That's fine, yes. At

00:29.525 --> 00:31.928
Texas A&M, I'm known as Thad. A Ansley,

00:32.380 --> 00:42.330
in some way a mix up in my transcribing my high 
school grades to Texas A&M. Thaddeus, no middle

00:43.471 --> 00:49.077
initial Ansley, became Thad A, initial only 
Ansley. My father, Benjamin Thomas Ansley, Jr.,

00:50.658 --> 01:00.548
was born in 1870 in Johnson County, Texas. My 
mother, Goldie Fanny Nally Ansley, was born in

01:00.899 --> 01:07.889
West Station. That's in Ellis County, Texas. I was 
in 1879. I was the fifth child and the fifth

01:14.818 --> 01:20.967
consecutive son of B.T. and Goldie Ansley was born 
in Channing, Texas, the home of the XIT Ranch, in

01:21.027 --> 01:29.218
1906. Channing, Texas is in Hartley County.

01:36.505 --> 01:53.009
From in 1908, my father, my father at the time was, 
had been superintendent of schools at Channing,

01:36.505 --> 01:53.009
Texas and then he became the land agent for the XIT 
Ranch and sold it, made a lot of money, made

01:36.505 --> 01:53.009
$50,000. He had $50,000 in cash and went to 
Plainview, Texas and established the third

01:53.590 --> 01:58.277
national bank. built the building and is still 
standing on the square there and built a nine-room

01:59.287 --> 02:05.036
house on a quarter of a block of land. I believe it's 
been moved recently. In 1908, we moved to

02:09.182 --> 02:14.130
Plainview, Texas. And my father ran the Ansel Land 
Cattle Company there and two other children. The

02:19.738 --> 02:22.122
sixth child was a girl and the seventh child was a 
boy, Benjamin Thomas Ansley III, who is also a

02:23.587 --> 02:33.376
Texas Aggie, the class of 45,

02:23.587 --> 02:33.376
were born in Plainview. And we moved to Amarillo in 
Potter County, Texas in 1917. And that has been my

02:38.460 --> 02:42.724
home since then. Since 17. And did you go to school? 
I went to Amarillo High School. I pride myself in

02:46.687 --> 02:51.872
the fact that I was a member of the first Amarillo 
Golden Sandstorm baseball team.

02:56.493 --> 03:04.744
I lettered in baseball and basketball at my 
mother's

02:56.493 --> 03:04.744
high school. Are either of your parents still 
living? No, my father and mother are both dead. My

03:10.472 --> 03:17.742
father lived to be 86 and my mother to be about 80. 
factors were involved in your choice of Texas A&M

03:17.975 --> 03:23.342
as a school? My uh one of my neighbor boys brother 
worked for the county here for the the Potter

03:23.362 --> 03:31.532
County engineer. The Potter County engineer was 
Colonel O.A. Seward who is from Washington County

03:34.095 --> 03:45.349
and a class of ought nine I believe or one of the 
early classes of Texas A&M and We liked him and we

03:45.953 --> 03:50.760
fell in love with his description of Texas A&M. We 
decided to be civil engineers. Incidentally, I am

03:53.584 --> 03:55.887
now in the dry cleaning business. My college 
roommate who lives here now is an

03:55.907 --> 04:11.809
independent rancher investments, but he has 
never practiced a day of civil, neither of us have

03:55.907 --> 04:11.809
ever practiced a day of civil engineering.

04:12.869 --> 04:14.912
So it was a personal acquaintance type thing. 
That's right. I think so. You had never been to the

04:16.775 --> 04:18.677
campus before. No, I had never been to campus. Of 
course, that was a day and a half or a two-day train

04:20.360 --> 04:26.969
ride from Amarillo to College Station at that 
time. That's a pretty good day's car drive today,

04:26.990 --> 04:29.894
even with good highway. That's right. What were 
your first reactions to the campus when you

04:32.998 --> 04:40.429
arrived there as an incoming freshman?

04:40.848 --> 04:49.956
college roommate, who was also my neighbor here in 
Amarillo, had gone on ahead to meet some friends in

04:40.848 --> 04:49.956
Houston. And he met me at the station at the old H&TC 
station. Well, that's good enough, H&TC station

04:58.143 --> 05:01.906
and college station. And one of the biggest 
disappointments in my life was that I knew that

05:03.228 --> 05:10.534
there would be 200 people, 200 sophomores to meet 
me at the station at A&M with the board. Of course

05:13.843 --> 05:22.591
they weren't, and this old old person I knew in the 
world there was my 2B college roommate, and he met

05:13.843 --> 05:22.591
me at the station. We took that long walk from the 
station up to the main building, and two country

05:22.631 --> 05:36.705
boys you've never seen, we went to looking around, 
and we asked them if they knew where we could find

05:22.631 --> 05:36.705
Dobbin. Now Dobbin happened to be a man named an 
umbrella man that we knew down there that was in

05:40.028 --> 05:43.273
Calgary. He was a senior. And they says, who do you 
mean? I said, well, don't you know Dobbin Dodson?

05:49.123 --> 05:52.949
They says, you mean Major Dodson. So anyway, we 
found out that who we called Dobbin or Ham was known

05:52.969 --> 06:00.080
as Dusty Dodson at Texas A&M. And he was a major, and 
he finally, this placement. put us in the room in

06:07.754 --> 06:09.658
Milner Hall. So I spent my first night at Texas A&M 
in Milner Hall, and once again, I must say that I was

06:09.999 --> 06:17.777
disappointed. There wasn't any haze, and they 
left us alone. We heard lots of noise and lots of

06:19.862 --> 06:23.991
things going on, but they didn't bother us. Did you 
have to go through any special procedures to get

06:24.140 --> 06:29.088
into the school? I mean, did you have to apply in 
advance or did you just appear on the scene? No, our

06:33.816 --> 06:37.421
grades were sent ahead of us in transcript. I don't 
know whether it was called transcript then or not.

06:40.306 --> 06:45.674
But did the school ask Amarillo High School for 
them, or did you ask Amarillo High School to send

06:40.306 --> 06:45.674
the grades? We asked Amarillo High School to send 
them. Uh-huh. So they had reason to believe, at

06:47.717 --> 06:51.402
least at A&M, that you were coming. That's right. 
And your grades were acceptable to them, so they

06:52.324 --> 06:55.388
let you in. So then did you register? You got there 
one day. Did you register the next day? I do not

07:03.280 --> 07:04.241
know. I can't answer that question. What I mean 
is... I would say within the next day or two. And

07:10.086 --> 07:11.809
then you started classes right after that. 
Started classes the next month. Could you

07:14.874 --> 07:18.380
describe a typical day while you were there? What I 
mean is, tell us something about the procedure of

07:18.941 --> 07:32.503
getting up, the time you got up, the time you spent 
in classes, what you did otherwise other than

07:18.941 --> 07:32.503
going to class, what time you went to bed, and what 
procedure there was involved in going to bed. They

07:33.243 --> 07:40.352
had puttees or leggings, I believe, wrapped 
leggings when I was at Texas A&M. And so we set our

07:40.372 --> 07:46.520
alarm clock for 30 minutes ahead of the time. I've 
even forgotten what time it was, but I'm sure it was

07:46.580 --> 07:50.224
about 5.30 in the morning. We had to get up 30 
minutes before everyone else to wrap our leggings

07:50.244 --> 07:57.213
because we didn't know how. This was the fish. 
Yeah, the freshmen, yes, were fish. And... We met

08:03.533 --> 08:21.250
revelry at some unearthly hour to a high school boy 
that had always been pampered at home and lived

08:03.533 --> 08:21.250
within a block of the schoolhouse, so I never was a 
very early riser. Likewise, my college roommate

08:23.652 --> 08:30.739
who lived next door, we both lived within 100 yards 
of the schoolhouse.

08:32.035 --> 08:42.298
After Reveille and Drill, which I kind of 
associate that with part of A&M, you learn to right

08:43.325 --> 09:10.463
there you learn to become a part of a squad and you 
learn that that's the best squad in the in the world

08:43.325 --> 09:10.463
and then it's your platoons the best platoon in the 
world and then it's your uh company's the best it

08:43.325 --> 09:10.463
goes on kind of like that i think that's one of the 
reasons for loyalty to any and they teach you they

08:43.325 --> 09:10.463
start at the beginning to try to endeavor to do 
something or make the best of things that they are

09:11.118 --> 09:24.729
Of course, after coming back to the room, then we

09:11.118 --> 09:24.729
got further dressed, I presume, and marched to our 
meals, breakfast. After breakfast in the mess

09:24.749 --> 09:32.876
hall, we could idle or walk back to the dormitory. 
It seemed like as a freshman, all classes began at 8

09:32.896 --> 09:35.598
o'clock. I don't know whether that's not true, but 
it seemed that way.

09:42.488 --> 09:45.313
I couldn't tell you now how many hours. It seemed 
like 17 hours, but that's... 17 class hours a week.

09:53.566 --> 09:56.871
17 class hours a week, but that's immaterial.

09:58.775 --> 10:05.205
As an engineering student, we took... All 
engineering students took basic... one basic

10:06.687 --> 10:09.110
subject or basic subject. I had to be in section 26. 
I believe my roommate was in class section 25. I

10:14.157 --> 10:33.184
don't know whether it was according to 
intelligence test of which the intelligence test

10:14.157 --> 10:33.184
at Texas A&M was my first intelligence test and it 
was a big shock to me because I had never had a test of

10:14.157 --> 10:33.184
that kind that I know of. So I imagine we were placed 
in sections according to our rate on our

10:34.615 --> 10:40.302
intelligence test. Did you have to reform in 
companies for noon meal? Oh yes, we then we at noon

10:45.908 --> 11:02.007
we come back to the dormitories and made formation 
and marched to the mess hall and once again we could

10:45.908 --> 11:02.007
amble back to our rooms and do most anything we 
wanted to. As a freshman, there was very little

11:03.860 --> 11:08.886
idle time. There was always something doing and 
studying. I thought I was an athlete, and I had

11:15.335 --> 11:23.445
gotten through high school probably for that 
reason. At Texas A&M, I studied five hours every

11:23.465 --> 11:29.833
day.

11:30.505 --> 11:36.876
The only way that I could get by, I think I finally 
learned how to study. That happens to a lot of

11:37.498 --> 11:38.680
people. As a matter of fact, I think probably to 
most people when they get out of high school into

11:40.242 --> 11:45.993
college, they have to learn how to study, first of 
all. And it was very difficult for me. And I was

11:48.317 --> 11:54.488
taking civil engineering, which I know now that I 
was not qualified to. parts of it. I was like

11:58.375 --> 12:04.824
mathematics, and I thought the civil engineer 
would be for me, but I found out since it wasn't.

12:04.844 --> 12:06.446
Then what about during the afternoon? Did you have 
labs? We had labs, of course.

12:14.036 --> 12:22.467
I know all freshman students had to take fish 
chemistry, of which four years later most of them

12:14.036 --> 12:22.467
were still taking fish chemistry. and had 
laboratory, three hours of laboratory a week and

12:23.527 --> 12:31.219
two hours of class work is the way I remember it. We 
had a little bit of mechanical engineering and

12:32.922 --> 12:39.853
they told us, we called it iron pounding. They told 
us some fundamentals about brazing metals or

12:39.913 --> 12:47.205
welding metals together and we called it iron 
pounding. of which I'm still not qualified to do.

12:54.553 --> 12:59.580
After my freshman year, I bought my father a chisel 
that I made now iron pounding. And he said, well,

12:59.600 --> 13:04.266
when I brought it back to him, he said, well, that's 
a $600 chisel. That's what he'd call it. He'd send

13:05.127 --> 13:09.092
me to school, Texas A&M, $600. $630, I believe, was 
my expenses from the day I left Amarillo until the

13:09.832 --> 13:18.705
day I came back to Amarillo in June. That even 
included the Christmas holidays. I spent $630,

13:20.307 --> 13:24.113
and I never worked a minute in my freshman year. Did 
you come home for Christmas? I came home for

13:27.077 --> 13:28.179
Christmas. Of course, as I say, it was at least a day 
and a half and probably two days train ride from

13:28.720 --> 13:36.411
College Station. We would ride the train, H&TC up 
to Fort Worth, and then get to Fort Worth and Denver

13:40.561 --> 13:47.991
from Fort Worth to Amarillo.

13:49.634 --> 14:06.838
One of our great experiences was football trips, 
getting to make the football trips to Austin and to

13:49.634 --> 14:06.838
Waco

13:49.634 --> 14:06.838
for the Baylor games, which is quite an experience 
for a country boy.

14:07.308 --> 14:12.877
At that time, 2,300 cadets all on the trains, which 
would take four special trains to haul us. Did each

14:14.499 --> 14:18.205
cadet have to pay for a ticket on the train? Oh, yes, 
yes. Of course, not all of us paid. I guess you heard

14:21.030 --> 14:29.062
some pretty good stories about how we hit them on 
the, what is it, the blinds and one way or another.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.244
Anyway... You get that many boys together, 
there's a lot of conniving. Yeah, and then you paid

14:33.368 --> 14:36.451
admission to the game too. That's right, that's 
right. But at that point, you went by train to

14:38.473 --> 14:41.176
Austin and to? Train to Baylor, Waco. Waco, did you 
go to either Dallas or Fort Worth that year, the

14:43.277 --> 14:48.442
year you were there? I don't believe we did that my 
freshman year. I have been on those later. One of

14:54.227 --> 14:59.252
the things to us was, it takes A&M. the kush or pie or 
dessert, it seemed to us that everybody had all the

15:00.464 --> 15:08.376
raisin pie they wanted. And we had a boy from 
Maryland, who shall remain nameless, they gave us

15:09.358 --> 15:22.238
a meal ticket at Waco, the merchants did, to buy, 
and we could buy anything we wanted to to eat. And

15:22.278 --> 15:24.261
one of the Texas A&M boys bought a Raisin pie, and I 
guess till his dying day, he lived to regret that.

15:30.461 --> 15:34.145
We never let him forget.

15:34.665 --> 15:37.969
Okay, back to the typical day then. Did you reform 
your companies to go to supper? We reformed,

15:43.314 --> 15:49.641
made a formation to march to supper. We marched 
supper and came back, and then we were supposed to

15:50.735 --> 15:54.000
be in our room. Once again, we could amble back to 
the room, but there was usually some sophomore

15:54.921 --> 16:04.196
that wanted us to come back and see him for some 
reason or another. And we had to be in our room, I'm

16:05.017 --> 16:08.943
going to say, by 7 or 8 o'clock. And we were supposed 
to be in our room then until 1045. And then from 1045

16:13.904 --> 16:23.518
to 11, we could do anything in the world we wanted to 
or go anywhere we wanted to just so we didn't leave

16:13.904 --> 16:23.518
the campus for 15 minutes. And then what? Like 
that? And then 11 nights out at 11. That was a

16:29.628 --> 16:30.990
typical day. Of course, there's lots of 
variations because some nights they were aired

16:31.030 --> 16:39.222
out or threats of being aired out. I don't know that 
we had too many. We were... I happened to be in

16:42.760 --> 16:46.666
Foster Hall in Fish Heaven. There were, it's the 
fourth floor of Foster Hall and there was no one

16:46.686 --> 17:02.389
lived up there but freshmen and they called it Fish 
Heaven so they didn't want to climb those steps and

16:46.686 --> 17:02.389
get after us too much but there was always that 
threat of we were going to get aired out. It seemed

17:03.151 --> 17:05.494
like it every night, of course it wasn't. And we got 
somewhere out of place and we were drowned out too,

17:06.352 --> 17:12.380
a time or two. What about, did they have a midnight 
yell practice or anything of that nature? Yes, the

17:18.528 --> 17:27.339
midnight

17:18.528 --> 17:27.339
yell practice was really a scary experience. The 
first time I experienced it, Dutch Horn came to

17:27.359 --> 17:35.430
town and That was my first knowledge of that great 
old man. And he told us all about how A&M was going to

17:42.285 --> 17:49.554
dogs because it was going to let girls in it. This 
was in 1924. And he told us some of the pitfalls of

17:50.896 --> 17:57.043
girls at Texas A&M University. And we had a lot of 
fun. I said it would be all right. We'd go back to her

18:00.545 --> 18:02.507
room whenever we wanted to. And I don't know 
whether it took an hour and a half out of her life or

18:02.547 --> 18:05.369
what. But anyway, it was really some experience to 
go to those midnight Yale practices.

18:18.401 --> 18:26.548
I can't remember whether I have been pretty well 
associated with Texas A&M. And I have been to

18:26.568 --> 18:27.709
their. were a fallen comrade. What is that called? 
Silver taps? Silver taps. I've been to those and I

18:33.502 --> 18:39.708
can't remember whether as a freshman I had those or 
not. But it's a very impressive ceremony and I have

18:39.748 --> 18:51.219
been to them through the years and I know and I 
can't, my memory failed me whether I had one as a

18:39.748 --> 18:51.219
freshman or not. But I know I've always been 
impressed with silver taps. You mentioned a

18:54.385 --> 19:01.113
minute ago that you lived the year you were there in 
the fourth floor of Foster Hall in Fish Heaven.

19:03.516 --> 19:04.798
What was life like? I mean, was it pretty wild and 
woolly at times in the dormitory? Oh, yes, it was

19:07.942 --> 19:11.546
wild and woolly. There was almost never a dull 
moment. The other fish in the company knew that

19:16.312 --> 19:23.481
they'd come up there and not be molested by the 
sophomores, or that was the assumption. And we had

19:24.828 --> 19:29.955
a lot of visitors up there that were freshmen. And 
also, it had its misgivings in the fact that when a

19:29.975 --> 19:36.763
sophomore wanted a freshman, he knew where to find 
one.

19:39.907 --> 19:46.756
One of my things I started with when I first went to 
Texas A&M was I went in my room and locked my door.

19:46.796 --> 19:48.078
And of course, that's a fallacy. There's no way you 
can lock a door in Texas A&M that I knew of. Because

19:51.742 --> 19:54.666
someone could get a bayonet and come right on in as 
if Of course, that's one of the first things I

19:55.287 --> 19:59.816
learned, too, is how to get in another room. I think 
that is part of the Aggie tradition about the

20:01.379 --> 20:05.406
openness. There's no way you can, as they say now, a 
man can be an island unto himself because it takes

20:05.446 --> 20:13.662
saying him. There wasn't any such thing as 
privacy.

20:20.228 --> 20:26.863
I don't mean that they meddled in everyone's 
business, but your door was open. Well, I visited

20:26.884 --> 20:35.163
A&M campus a number of times when I was an 
undergraduate at Texas Lutheran, and I was always

20:26.884 --> 20:35.163
impressed by two things. One, the friendliness of 
the students. And two, the fact that a student

20:38.150 --> 20:46.261
could put down almost anything anywhere and come 
back any time later and they'd still be there.

20:47.163 --> 20:47.924
That's right. And the last three years I observed 
and kind of feel that unfortunately neither of

20:48.705 --> 20:57.157
those are quite as true as they used to be. The 
friendliness is there on occasion, but of course

20:58.619 --> 21:07.431
certainly you're not greeted by everybody as you 
were when it was an all-military school. And I

21:07.900 --> 21:15.087
think there's a little bit of reluctance to put 
something down, and he clicked to come back an hour

21:07.900 --> 21:15.087
later and find it. It's an unforgivable sin not to 
speak to anyone at Texas A&M, of course. One of the

21:23.355 --> 21:25.537
first things you learn is to introduce yourself. 
We learned was to introduce yourself to everyone

21:26.138 --> 21:29.421
else. My first experience along that line, I 
introduced myself to a man, and I told him Fish

21:33.989 --> 21:38.816
Ansley was my name. Incidentally, my name was Fish 
Ansley for the entire freshman year, which at

21:38.836 --> 21:48.229
first it kind of stung, but I learned to be awful 
proud of it.

21:51.254 --> 21:54.759
This sophomore says, Fish Ansley, you've met me 
before. And I says, no, I haven't, sir. He says,

21:56.541 --> 21:58.444
well, you've been over it. And I'll show you what my 
name is. His name happened to be Harry A. Holzer,

22:01.561 --> 22:06.628
Jr. I shall never forget that name, and he would be 
named Junior. And now it's 50 years ago that this

22:09.693 --> 22:17.524
happened, and I still know Harry A. Holzer, Jr., 
because he spelled it out with each letter with a

22:09.693 --> 22:17.524
board. It's been a very valuable lesson to me 
through life. I have, when I'm introduced to

22:23.585 --> 22:42.211
anyone, I pay attention to their name now, because 
if you get, that happened to me one other occasion,

22:23.585 --> 22:42.211
but the man's name wasn't that long, so it wouldn't 
make that big an impression on me, but I have

22:23.585 --> 22:42.211
learned to pay attention, which is very valuable. 
It's nothing but courteous that I found that, and I

22:42.291 --> 22:49.862
appreciate that fact.

22:53.015 --> 22:55.918
I must say that we were isolated. Texas A&M 
College, at the time I was there, was isolated,

22:55.959 --> 23:10.997
meaning the only way we had through civilization, 
which was Brian, was by trolley car. We called it

23:11.037 --> 23:12.699
the Tunerville Trolley. And of course, freshmen 
couldn't go but one day a week, and that was Sunday

23:13.239 --> 23:20.608
unless we sneaked off or something.

23:23.710 --> 23:26.893
We always, there was always something to do. Of 
course sophomores thought that too, that he did,

23:28.855 --> 23:38.946
but you,

23:28.855 --> 23:38.946
of course you can always study a little bit. What 
sorts of things did the sophomores have you do for

23:38.966 --> 23:43.251
them? Oh, let's see. Of course we cleaned up 
sophomores' rooms. We became their maids in a way

23:49.934 --> 23:56.424
of, I don't know whether that's what they called 
them or not. The term dog robber was still in use

23:57.466 --> 24:06.079
when I was at school and we almost became their dog 
robber. When they wanted to borrow candy from

24:06.119 --> 24:16.515
Casey's, they just stuck their head out the door 
and hollered freshman and you were supposed to go

24:06.119 --> 24:16.515
down and they'd go. You go get them the bar of candy 
or anything else that they might desire.

24:28.664 --> 24:36.834
I thought it was terrible at the time, but I can't 
remember anything that they ever made me do that

24:28.664 --> 24:36.834
rankled me much. Of course, we went to the post 
office for them. There's only one post office

24:38.916 --> 24:40.518
there. Then it was in the back of one of the Air Force 
dormitories. Did you ever have to do things like

24:47.073 --> 24:51.940
carry their laundry over? Yeah, we carried their 
clothes to the laundry.

24:57.749 --> 25:02.035
We were kind of almost maids in a way. You had to 
sweep out the room and make the bed? Did you have to

25:06.542 --> 25:08.004
make the bed every day? Every day, every morning. 
We made their beds, which has become a pretty

25:09.967 --> 25:15.375
good... business for me in later years when my wife 
kind of liked the fact that i could make a bed i i must

25:16.216 --> 25:45.683
hesitate to say here those people that gave me the 
most chores and and gave me the most hell

25:16.216 --> 25:45.683
turned out to be my greatest friends they were the 
people that would have done anything in the world

25:16.216 --> 25:45.683
for me and and i still revere them to this day This is 
a form of hazing. It's kind of like your parents.

25:49.366 --> 26:00.081
It's a form of hazing that you need because I don't 
believe, I must say right here, I don't know of

25:49.366 --> 26:00.081
anybody in the world that was as smart as I was when I 
went to Texas A&M. I knew everything in the world.

26:02.124 --> 26:03.766
It wasn't old, I thought.

26:08.292 --> 26:10.095
But I take it you learned pretty quickly. You 
didn't know everything. I sure did. I wondered how

26:12.258 --> 26:15.923
those people could tell that I was a freshman. 
because I'd come from a bigger town than one of the

26:16.257 --> 26:24.534
larger towns in the state down there, and those 
were just old country boys, and how in the world

26:16.257 --> 26:24.534
they could tell I was a freshman. They made me wear a 
fish stripe, which would put a white stripe around

26:24.554 --> 26:37.641
my left wrist, at the shirt, and on the shirt, and 
they called that a fish stripe, and of course I

26:24.554 --> 26:37.641
didn't need that because They could tell I was a 
fish as if I had a neon sign six blocks off. They knew

26:42.297 --> 26:45.221
I was a fish, as we all later learned. You can tell a 
fish just as far as you can see. What was the food

26:49.167 --> 26:50.769
like in the mess hall? Well, I gained 15 pounds the 
first 15 days I was at Texas A&M. I'm sure that, as I

27:01.884 --> 27:07.392
say, I did a little running around when I was at 
home. And I got down to A&M, and we had regular food

27:07.979 --> 27:12.424
and regular hours. And I went from 155 pounds to 170 
pounds in 15 days. And I have never been able to

27:21.714 --> 27:25.919
criticize the food at Texas A&M. Now, I know some 
people that didn't do that way, but it wasn't that

27:25.999 --> 27:31.825
way with me. And I still. have thoughts of apricot 
pie. Most people used to call pineapple kush. They

27:38.131 --> 27:39.553
thought that was the greatest thing in the world. 
It's fresh, but it was apricot kush with me. I

27:42.378 --> 27:47.568
really and truly, I've never found any apricot pie 
that tastes that good again. Well, who was in the

27:48.229 --> 27:50.774
mess hall then when you were there? Duncan. 
Duncan. Did they have a number of students working

27:52.597 --> 27:55.241
in there? Yes, they had a lot of students working. 
Waiting tables? Waiting tables. Washing dishes?

28:01.991 --> 28:06.879
And I don't know why I said they called those mess 
hall hounds. What? No, meal hounds, what they

28:07.380 --> 28:10.725
called the boys that ate too much. I've forgotten 
what they called. Sabezas.

28:16.434 --> 28:21.321
It's been so long ago that I can't remember whether 
I'd ever seen... ever saw Mr. Spieser, but Duncan

28:21.554 --> 28:25.762
was there at the time. I can't remember, but I think 
Duncan succeeded Spieser. Yes, that's right. One

28:31.813 --> 28:36.061
of my fondest memories is of Charlie Nitsch. 
Charlie Nitsch was, I'm going to say, an Italian

28:36.181 --> 28:41.611
alien or immigrant to this country. He ran the 
tailor shop there, and he was kind of a point of

28:45.382 --> 28:47.204
ridicule. Of course, I never dreamed that I would 
end up in the dry cleaning business for my life's

28:47.625 --> 28:53.452
work after Charlie and Itch. We used to kind of kid 
quite a bit about Charlie and Itch down there. He

29:01.702 --> 29:02.763
ran the tailor shop? He ran the tailor shop. Of 
course, when your uniforms were issued to you, it

29:04.706 --> 29:09.532
seemed that they never fit. So you had to go down to 
Charlie and Itch and get them all. fitted so

29:12.584 --> 29:31.588
everybody got to know Charlie niche one way or 
another and you mentioned earlier that say the

29:12.584 --> 29:31.588
fish could go to town what once once a week once a 
Sunday or Saturday or Sunday what what privileges

29:32.075 --> 29:35.119
in addition to that, say, did an upperclassman 
have? Could a sophomore go to town more often than

29:35.159 --> 29:37.702
that? I don't believe the sophomores were 
supposed to go any often than that. Of course, the

29:41.767 --> 29:47.134
juniors and seniors almost had to free run the 
campus. I

29:48.776 --> 29:57.306
believe the sophomores were just about as 
supposed to stay on the campus about as much as

29:48.776 --> 29:57.306
freshmen. And so, but the only means of 
transportation out of there was either this

29:57.674 --> 30:03.062
trolley or the train. That's right. It was the 
Houston and Texas Central and, uh... The line,

30:07.929 --> 30:09.311
that's the Jenny. Now let's see, what do they call 
it? The INGN. Yeah, International Great Northern

30:11.655 --> 30:14.279
was the other one that ran through there. Uh, I must 
say right here that I see you've interviewed

30:15.320 --> 30:19.246
Harold Dunn. Uh, his hamburger stand was, I don't 
know if he spoke to you about it or not, but it was

30:20.368 --> 30:27.158
truly an oasis on the campus. And I've stood in line 
many a time for hamburgers from upperclassmen and

30:27.425 --> 30:33.579
also from myself. That's another one of the chores 
we used to do to get some of Harold Unn's

30:33.599 --> 30:38.730
hamburgers. He talked a little bit about his 
hamburger stand.
