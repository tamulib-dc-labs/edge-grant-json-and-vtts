WEBVTT

00:02.495 --> 00:06.162
personal meeting with General Earl Rutter. So Dr. 
Wooten just asked me, he says, Randy, do you have

00:07.263 --> 00:10.169
your uniform? And I said, well, it was in my truck. I 
mean, everything I own is in my truck. And he says,

00:16.239 --> 00:22.290
if you're going to Vietnam, you need to see General 
Rutter. And I kind of looked at him and I said, The

00:26.491 --> 00:29.115
General Rutter, I guess I said, okay. Well, it 
shows you how small the college was. I don't know

00:32.220 --> 00:36.868
for sure in 69 what Dr. Wooten's position was. He 
was just a really nice professor. He was my

00:38.531 --> 00:39.252
advisor. But he picked up the phone, and he called 
General Rutter's office, and he says, I was a first

00:39.292 --> 00:47.566
lieutenant then. You were second lieutenant for 
12 months, and then you were first lieutenant

00:48.227 --> 00:51.452
then. And he says, I have First Lieutenant Randy 
House here. He's a 67 A&M class of 67, and he's en

00:55.204 --> 01:02.834
route to Vietnam. He leaves in three or four days, 
and I think General Rutter would like to talk to

01:02.854 --> 01:07.540
him. Well, whoever was running General Rutter's 
outer office said, wait a minute, and the next

01:08.561 --> 01:15.911
thing we knew, we had an appointment like 45 
minutes. So I ran out, put on my uniform, and Dr.

01:16.932 --> 01:21.118
Wooten and I marched up there, and I didn't even 
know where his office was, and he showed me where it

01:21.638 --> 01:32.569
was, and I went in there, and it was just the three of 
us. And I'll never forget, he asked

01:34.091 --> 01:50.447
me a few questions, and I was a ranger, and I was in 
infantry, and airborne, and then he saw my aviator

01:34.091 --> 01:50.447
wings, and he said, you're an airborne infantry 
ranger aviator. And I said, yes, sir. And he says,

01:55.830 --> 01:57.391
and you're only a lieutenant. And I said, well, 
sir, they just, all I, except for a few months in the

01:58.272 --> 02:06.721
82nd Airborne, I've just been in schools all this 
time, and those were just all the schools I went to.

02:08.222 --> 02:10.064
And he says, you know, I was a ranger. I said, yes, 
sir, I know all about the 2nd Rangers. I said, I've

02:12.667 --> 02:17.852
read the books, and I can tell you everything about 
the 2nd Ranger Battalion. And he says, well, so

02:18.912 --> 02:22.657
you're going to go to Vietnam and fly helicopters? 
And I said, yes, sir. And he said, well, the main

02:25.461 --> 02:32.231
thing about combat is taking care of the troops. 
And he says taking care of the troops does not mean

02:34.534 --> 02:38.740
coddling them or babying them. It means making 
sure they're trained and they're ready to and

02:43.398 --> 02:57.087
they're tough and they don't quit but that you're 
out there sharing the hardships with them and

02:43.398 --> 02:57.087
you're not in some warm tent when they're freezing 
or or you're dry when they're wet or whatever. And

03:00.493 --> 03:14.107
he says, you know, that's the main thing that I can, 
and I don't remember, we talked for the longest

03:00.493 --> 03:14.107
time, but that's what I remember was he didn't talk 
to me about bravery. He didn't talk to me about

03:14.888 --> 03:17.010
shooting straight. He didn't talk to me about any 
of those skills. It was taking care of the troops.

03:22.997 --> 03:27.782
And so, yeah, my, everything that I remember about 
General Rutter as a student, him moving it from a

03:28.437 --> 03:41.577
college to a university,

03:28.437 --> 03:41.577
him being the guy that saw that if it was gonna 
become a great university, it had to be coed. And so

03:42.619 --> 03:56.740
in my unit, because General Rudder was in favor of 
it, and I thought General Rudder walked on water, I

03:42.619 --> 03:56.740
said, it's good that we're a university and it's 
good that we have co-eds, but intellectually, I

03:57.260 --> 04:02.528
couldn't debate a good debater. Because some of 
the guys had already figured out all the bad points

04:02.608 --> 04:08.796
of a university and co-ed things. And all I could 
say was, the general wants this, and we've got to

04:09.578 --> 04:16.367
support him. And I said, if we, and I remember 
telling the group, I said, if we fight this, It's

04:24.378 --> 04:25.700
just going to make it harder. It's going to happen 
anyway, but it's not going to be done as well. I

04:28.785 --> 04:33.734
said, what General Rudder needs is our support. 
And I remember just telling a group of people that,

04:34.916 --> 04:39.363
and I was definitely the minority. All right. What 
about making the Corps non-compulsory? Well,

04:43.350 --> 04:45.133
that happened at the same time. How did you and your 
associates feel about that? Well... it was

04:49.842 --> 05:19.478
interesting although I did not take the core 
seriously as seriously as I wish I would have or I

04:49.842 --> 05:19.478
could have or as I did a little later I felt the core 
was a good thing and I wasn't into intellectually

04:49.842 --> 05:19.478
the freedom of choosing so I was probably a pretty 
much of a traditionalist and I didn't see the

05:20.268 --> 05:23.453
wisdom of that. But I never, for some reason, I 
can't tell you what General Rutter's position was

05:24.555 --> 05:29.502
on it. You know, I mean, at the time, I know what it is 
now. I mean, I know he was a proponent of, you know, a

05:32.026 --> 05:46.509
university had to widen its vision blocks, but for 
some reason, he wasn't getting criticized or

05:32.026 --> 05:46.509
credited with that, and so I didn't. What about 
integration, racial integration? Do you know

05:49.512 --> 06:12.016
that before I got into the Army, I don't think I ever 
met, I did not, I wasn't ever in a football game, a

05:49.512 --> 06:12.016
situation, a classroom, anything with a Jew or a 
black. But y'all were aware there were black

06:12.036 --> 06:15.740
students starting to attend A&M, weren't you? 
Right, but I never saw one. No, but what was the

06:17.101 --> 06:18.743
attitude? See, I

06:19.077 --> 06:28.828
haven't uncovered so far anybody that thought 
that was bad. No. I was raised... down here at this

06:33.455 --> 06:42.067
ranch, and the land we bought was in 1865 given to 
three slave families. And when my daddy in 1955

06:43.069 --> 06:53.323
bought this land, there was like 100 heirs to these 
families, these 1865 families. And everybody,

06:54.065 --> 07:00.694
all my neighbors were black, and they were all good 
people. And we all, you know, they helped me in the

07:01.585 --> 07:06.812
hay fields. And I always felt, that's my fax, I 
always felt, you know, they were okay. So I never

07:15.203 --> 07:21.272
had any negative black minority situation. So I 
wasn't, I don't think I was prejudiced. It's just

07:24.476 --> 07:25.197
that In high school, they were just never there. I 
remember as soon as I got in the Army and some of the

07:31.568 --> 07:56.213
things started happening with Martin Luther King 
and all that and the marches and all that started

07:31.568 --> 07:56.213
happening, I was glad to see, I remember being glad 
to listen that Martin Luther King was talking

07:31.568 --> 07:56.213
nonviolence because I felt even back then that if 
blacks became violent, we were going to be in big

07:57.340 --> 07:58.762
trouble. And so I was kind of a fan of Martin Luther 
King when I first started reading about his

07:59.303 --> 08:05.474
speeches. But I don't remember integration being 
a big deal, not like women and not like going from a

08:06.335 --> 08:14.970
college to a university. Let me turn this.

08:19.497 --> 08:20.479
As a sophomore, Anything

08:21.725 --> 08:29.376
unusual happen with academics? Any major changes 
for you as a sophomore? No, nothing stands out

08:34.464 --> 08:47.142
except I took organic chemistry, 227,

08:34.464 --> 08:47.142
228. and I made D's and Dr. Romaine told me that I 
would not be accepted to vet school. I didn't know

08:56.674 --> 09:05.523
whether to believe him or not because I found 
entries where I even had my checklist of when I'm

08:56.674 --> 09:05.523
accepted to vet school, what I'm gonna do. But I was 
not accepted to vet school at the end of my

09:07.085 --> 09:11.369
sophomore year. You did apply. I did apply, oh 
yeah. I applied, matter of fact, I was an

09:13.592 --> 09:15.694
alternate. And they went through like 18, they 
accepted 120 something. And it turned to a three

09:24.944 --> 09:27.849
year program, three year around the clock. And 
they upped it to about 120. And I was like 18th

09:31.300 --> 09:35.444
alternate, and they went through around 15 
alternates.

09:37.306 --> 09:42.090
But I was very encouraged by that, and Dr. Romaine 
was. And so that's when he allowed me to take, in my

09:42.531 --> 09:49.357
junior year, veterinary genetics and some 
veterinary courses. And I don't know if it was out

09:50.158 --> 10:00.328
of the ordinary or whatever, but I took veterinary 
courses, and I made A's in them. At the end of my

10:01.405 --> 10:06.773
junior year, I applied to vet school. My grades 
were much better. I had demonstrated I could take

10:09.958 --> 10:15.226
vet courses and make A's, and I wasn't even an 
alternate. But what had happened was the Vietnam

10:15.286 --> 10:28.105
War had gotten serious, and most of those that were 
accepted at A&M were not pre-vet, but they were

10:28.473 --> 10:41.646
they had their degrees, they had four-year 
degrees, and so it became what I felt was a dodge,

10:28.473 --> 10:41.646
you know, a draft dodge. And so there's so many 
people applied, and they were still on except 120,

10:42.387 --> 10:51.576
and although I was doing better, I didn't even, you 
know, I wasn't even in the hunt anymore. So at the

10:51.676 --> 10:55.780
end of my junior year, I knew... that I wouldn't be a 
veterinarian at that time. And then

11:01.584 --> 11:12.219
simultaneously with that,

11:01.584 --> 11:12.219
my brother had just gotten out of the Navy as an 
officer. He was a Tulane graduate, had gone

11:13.020 --> 11:17.987
through Navy ROTC, had done his two years in the 
Navy. and was in the Navy Reserves and chose to be in

11:18.845 --> 11:25.955
the active reserves in Houston and was in a CB 
company. He was a company commander of a CB company

11:25.975 --> 11:29.560
in Houston, Texas. Well, there was a, right at this 
time, there was the Department of Defense, and

11:30.662 --> 11:47.907
I've subsequently researched it, were debating, 
it was the, butter and guns debate with Lyndon

11:48.427 --> 12:09.097
Johnson, and Lyndon wanted the Great Society 
program to continue, and he detested the war, but

11:48.427 --> 12:09.097
he was determined to fight it without the reserves 
and without the National Guard, which we had never

11:48.427 --> 12:09.097
done before in the history of this nation. But some 
in the Department of Defense convinced somebody

12:10.619 --> 12:18.130
in the White House to do a test, so they called up one 
reserve air force unit, one reserve navy unit, one

12:18.582 --> 12:29.938
reserve marine unit, one reserve army unit, and 
sent them to Vietnam just as a test to see how they

12:18.582 --> 12:29.938
would do. Well, the unit they picked in the navy was 
my brother's unit, and he had just gone into

12:30.018 --> 12:39.592
business for himself as an architect in Houston. 
He had a brand new business because he'd been

12:40.654 --> 12:46.362
working for an architect for a couple years, and 
now he's just gone into his own business And he had

12:47.675 --> 12:50.959
three sons under the age of five. And he gets called 
up and he's one month from the end of his

12:52.702 --> 12:59.811
seven-year, eight-year commitment. I mean, one 
more month and he would have not been eligible. And

13:05.018 --> 13:07.641
he didn't even blink. He said, if that's the way it 
is, I'm going to Vietnam. So here I am. At the end of

13:13.426 --> 13:22.177
my junior year, my brother, who to this day is next 
to my dad, is the finest man I've ever met. He was

13:23.299 --> 13:37.577
seven years older than me, was an honor student, an 
unbelievable athlete, president of his class,

13:23.299 --> 13:37.577
always the top-notch guy, and I was kind of in the 
middle of the pack in my group. So here he was going

13:37.743 --> 13:41.587
to Vietnam, so I said, I'm going to Vietnam. I mean, 
my big brother's going to Vietnam, I'm going to

13:41.868 --> 13:43.870
Vietnam. So I went and talked to Colonel Simmons, 
Jim Simmons, my ROTC instructor friend, who was a

13:43.890 --> 13:56.845
captain then, and I said, well, what do you think we 
should do? And he says, well, you've got to make a

13:56.865 --> 13:59.909
decision. You said you didn't, you know, you went, 
you're... Your junior year you went contract, so

14:05.738 --> 14:14.331
you're under contract, and so you're going to ROTC 
summer camp at Fort Sill this summer. He said, what

14:15.513 --> 14:20.120
you need to do is you need to do real well at ROTC 
summer camp. You need to come back your senior year

14:20.821 --> 14:28.253
and just get the commission as quick as you can. and 
go to Vietnam, and then I said, do your duty, and he

14:29.009 --> 14:54.874
was an Aggie, Jim was an Aggie, and he says, then 
after that, you can either resign or stay in, and if

14:29.009 --> 14:54.874
you want to resign, try to come back here, and maybe 
then you'll be older, you'll be a graduate, you may

14:29.009 --> 14:54.874
be able to get into some kind of a master's program, 
and then be able to get back and be able to accept vet

14:29.009 --> 14:54.874
school. Things may be a little different a couple 
years from now. So I said, okay. So I went to ROTC

14:59.134 --> 15:01.757
summer camp that year. Where was it? At Fort Sill, 
Oklahoma. Tropical Oasis. Yeah. And it was really

15:08.485 --> 15:11.149
interesting.

15:12.951 --> 15:19.519
Whereas Army ROTC at A&M was a lot of marching. We 
didn't have the Rangers then. We didn't do a lot of

15:24.759 --> 15:28.867
real Army stuff. The rifle marksmanship was very 
focused and limited. And so what I knew about the

15:34.018 --> 15:39.850
Army was drill and ceremony. I get to...

15:43.529 --> 15:49.657
Fort Sill, and you go on compass courses, 
survival, escape and evasion courses. You have to

15:50.398 --> 15:53.081
shoot all kind of weapons. I mean, pistols, 
rifles, bazookas. You have to do all these things.

15:58.649 --> 16:00.371
Well, I was a natural at all that. And I came back 
from ROTC number one cadet in the program. I wasn't

16:08.702 --> 16:12.827
even an all, I was, my senior year, I was not 
anything. I was just a senior. And I came out of ROTC

16:15.877 --> 16:19.160
summer camp number one. Eddie Joe Davis was number 
15. All these guys that were... And so A&M didn't

16:23.304 --> 16:27.809
know what to do with me. All of a sudden, they had 
this guy who had never taken ROTC very seriously,

16:27.869 --> 16:43.084
had made A's in all the ROTC courses, had never 
caused any trouble, but hadn't been... You know,

16:43.452 --> 16:46.556
wasn't in the Ross Volunteers, wasn't in 
anything, you know. All of a sudden, he's the

16:46.596 --> 16:56.387
number one cadet out of 1,700 at ROTC summer camp in 
all the whole nation, you know. My, my, my. And so it

16:57.628 --> 17:00.832
was really interesting. One of the things I did up 
there was I maxed out the PT test. All the PT tests I

17:05.357 --> 17:07.620
scored 100 on. Well, so they said, we're going to 
put House in charge of preparing the juniors for

17:08.444 --> 17:14.493
summer camp. So we're going to create a special 
position. And he's not going to, you know, here at

17:17.838 --> 17:20.282
A&M. And so my whole senior year, I had a special 
office, a special staff, and our mission was to

17:20.382 --> 17:30.037
prepare the juniors. And so I started, I just took 
what we did at summer camp and started saying,

17:30.738 --> 17:37.168
well, we need to do these things. Well, it had never 
been done before at A&M. You mean you want to do a

17:40.042 --> 17:42.145
compass course? And I says, yeah, you got enough 
land out here and you got gullies and whatever. So I

17:46.170 --> 17:49.033
went out and built a compass course. And I said, 
look, you do all this rappelling and stuff and it's

17:49.393 --> 17:53.358
fun. And so I went and built a rappelling tower and 
qualified people in my whole senior year. brought

17:59.761 --> 18:00.842
these kids through. Well, I remember Gene 
Stallings was the football coach. And I wanted to

18:04.586 --> 18:11.494
set up a PT test and an obstacle course where the 
football team practiced. And this was not going to

18:12.815 --> 18:17.961
be a permanent thing, you know, but it was going to 
be semi-permanent. And so I had to go see Gene

18:19.042 --> 18:21.324
Stallings. Well, I'd never met him before. And I 
went in, you know, I got an appointment and went in

18:23.487 --> 18:33.041
there because it was, you know, the land was at 
premium and this is where, you know, my analysis, I

18:23.487 --> 18:33.041
need to do this thing. And I went in there and met him 
for the first time and he listened to me and he said,

18:33.642 --> 18:42.475
I heard what you were coming in here to ask and I was 
prepared to throw you out. But he said, it sounds

18:43.477 --> 18:49.065
like you're really serious about this program. 
And I said, sir, You know, if I can run these kids

18:51.179 --> 19:00.958
through here in the spring repeatedly, I said, 
we'll knock them dead at summer camp next summer.

19:01.780 --> 19:06.048
And I said, I'll have it all gone for spring 
training. I mean, I'll have it all gone. You can

19:07.952 --> 19:09.154
have all these fields. and everything so he gave me 
permission to use the fields and then we went out

19:09.708 --> 19:34.956
there and I don't know where I got the money but we 
built you know with railroad ties and two by fours

19:09.708 --> 19:34.956
we built this obstacle course and so that was my 
mission and then you know then the kids went off and

19:09.708 --> 19:34.956
I think we did the Aggies And ever since then, I've 
watched the ROTC summer camps, and the Aggies have

19:34.936 --> 19:42.886
done extremely well at ROTC summer camp. They 
didn't necessarily do well before. But now, even

19:46.891 --> 19:52.999
to this day, we have a junior preparation program, 
and that's what we needed. Now, to whom were you

19:53.900 --> 19:57.304
turning for advice? Jim Simmons. Jim Simmons. 
Yes, Captain Jim Simmons. All right, but for you

20:01.550 --> 20:03.272
generally... Academically. Dr. Romaine had 
been. And then Dr. Wooten. And Aggie. And Aggie, he

20:09.596 --> 20:11.278
was my advisor. Did you, were you thinking about a, 
let's say as a senior, if you didn't get into vet

20:13.261 --> 20:23.054
school ever, what would your career perhaps be? 
No. All I was doing was going to Vietnam, serving my

20:23.635 --> 20:27.641
country, coming back. And the only issue was did I 
come back and I'd taken the GRE, so was I going to go

20:30.944 --> 20:46.218
to graduate school in ag-eco, or was I just going to 
start taking, somehow get permission to take vet

20:30.944 --> 20:46.218
courses and then just kind of work my way in, and I 
hadn't sorted that out. But no, my whole life I'd

20:46.418 --> 20:53.244
wanted to be a horse doctor, and I was determined to 
be the best horse doctor around. And

20:54.024 --> 20:58.088
academically, do you feel that you got about the 
grades you earned? Oh, yeah. I... What was really

21:01.083 --> 21:12.140
interesting, and my cousin taught this to me, but I 
didn't learn it, because my senior year, I made

21:01.083 --> 21:12.140
almost all As. I really did well my senior year. And 
my junior year, I did much better. It was just that

21:17.648 --> 21:19.471
organic chemistry. But my cousin, who went to vet 
school and was accepted, Texas A&M would take like

21:19.491 --> 21:28.525
seven Louisiana students And they had hundreds 
applying, and he was one of those seven. And this

21:32.072 --> 21:33.994
was a kid I was raised with. Matter of fact, our 
birthdays are July 23rd and July 24th. We're the

21:38.158 --> 21:41.381
same age, and our mamas are sisters. And just a 
really close friend and close friend to this day. I

21:45.566 --> 21:51.211
remember when Donald came here, I would study with 
Donald, because I was taking a couple courses. And

21:52.172 --> 21:53.894
I'll never forget this. I studied for the exam at 
the time. Donald studied to know everything about

21:58.508 --> 22:02.693
the course, know everything about the subject. He 
never studied for an exam. And I figured that out,

22:06.377 --> 22:09.361
but I figured it out too late. And so then when I went 
to all through all my courses, you know, in the

22:10.562 --> 22:20.874
Army, I was always an honor graduate in every 
course. Every school I went to, I was a

22:21.395 --> 22:27.402
distinguished graduate of the Ranger School. I 
was the first to solo in my flight class. But my

22:32.631 --> 22:33.973
philosophy changed. I no longer studied for 
tests. I studied to know everything there was

22:36.016 --> 22:39.461
about the subject. And then I just would go take the 
test. And that's what Donald taught me, you know,

22:42.065 --> 22:45.911
as just a friend and a cousin. And then it just, and 
then when I went to graduate school at Clemson, you

22:46.692 --> 22:54.464
know, the Army said, you know, we're sending you to 
graduate school. You're representing the U.S.

22:55.065 --> 22:56.427
Army. You've got to make all As. And I was right out 
of Vietnam, and I said, yes, sir. And I went to

23:02.740 --> 23:05.123
Clemson and made all As. And I never made all As in my 
life. As far as you and your buddies knew, were

23:07.226 --> 23:15.377
there any giveaway courses at A&M when you were an 
undergraduate? If there were, I didn't know about

23:15.397 --> 23:18.060
it. Or it didn't register because, like I say, the 
only advice from my dad was take the hard courses

23:19.137 --> 23:27.790
that make you think and make you write and make you 
communicate. So I wasn't looking for easy

23:28.611 --> 23:31.014
courses. See, I really didn't. I was so confident I 
was going to get in vet school because I knew so much

23:32.557 --> 23:43.693
about horses and cattle that I figured that 
with... You know, as long as I took the tough

23:44.247 --> 23:47.251
courses and I did okay. It was just that organic 
chemistry that, yes, darling. Back on. As you look

23:51.918 --> 24:03.295
back, were there some courses that really were 
important to your future that you now realize you

23:51.918 --> 24:03.295
took as an undergraduate A&M? And or some people?

24:10.185 --> 24:13.410
Well, as far as individual courses, I don't, I 
don't, a course doesn't stick out

24:14.572 --> 24:28.381
that I can say was, you know, that really made a 
difference. I think I was guided enough,

24:28.441 --> 24:35.415
counseled enough that, that I, Had a fairly broad 
base of courses and the only ones I remember were

24:36.037 --> 24:57.066
the ones I didn't do well in you know that I stumbled 
and then didn't and even when I read in my journals I

24:36.037 --> 24:57.066
Admit I just didn't work hard enough because it at 
that time in my life I And it was always through the

24:58.160 --> 25:00.643
military. I was just a hard worker. And if I applied 
myself and I worked hard, then I got the results. If

25:06.871 --> 25:10.536
I backslid a little bit, I wasn't smart enough to 
pull it off. I wasn't gifted enough. And so every

25:12.378 --> 25:15.182
once in a while, I'd get caught like that. As far as 
people, it was interesting.

25:21.110 --> 25:22.672
Randy Madsen was in his heyday. He was my 
classmate. He and I played handball, and here he

25:24.772 --> 25:34.965
was, the best athlete in the world, but I could hang 
in there with him playing handball. I played

25:35.045 --> 25:50.644
handball for 30 years, and I learned, I took it in 
63, and when you read through my journals, that

25:35.045 --> 25:50.644
seemed to be the thing that I really enjoyed, was 
playing handball, and it was an equalizer. You

25:51.181 --> 25:54.124
didn't have to be the fastest guy in the world. You 
didn't have to be the quickest. You didn't have to

25:57.207 --> 25:59.029
be the biggest or the strongest. You had to be in 
excellent condition, and I was in excellent

25:59.550 --> 26:03.754
physical condition. That was always a hallmark of 
mine, even though I didn't have some of the other

26:04.455 --> 26:09.240
gifts. So Randy doesn't remember it. I've met him a 
couple times since then, and he doesn't remember

26:11.843 --> 26:18.910
us playing as much as I remember. But see, I was just 
a nothing. guy and he used to lift weights over

26:21.387 --> 26:27.957
there, you know, where the handball courts were. 
And then I think just to relax a little bit, he'd go

26:27.997 --> 26:31.362
up and play handball. Well, he wasn't a serious 
handball player and I was a serious handball

26:31.382 --> 26:34.507
player. So I always, I was, but I thought Randy 
Madsen represented Texas A&M in the Olympics, you

26:39.882 --> 26:44.372
know, and was just such a gentleman. And I 
remember, you know, how some of the people stood on

26:44.392 --> 26:52.090
the platforms and wanted some of these things they 
said in the interviews. And Randy was always such a

26:53.072 --> 26:55.678
class act. And I was always impressed with that. I 
knew Eddie Joe Davis all four years. Describe

27:01.966 --> 27:03.648
Eddie Joe as a student. Eddie Joe, you knew as a 
fish, was going to be the Corps commander. And

27:08.414 --> 27:13.881
Eddie Joe Davis, what was interesting about Eddie 
Joe was Eddie Joe was a nice guy. He was a nice

27:13.961 --> 27:15.183
person. But he was just very focused. And I always 
admired that about him. I wasn't focused on the

27:20.089 --> 27:23.514
Corps. I was focused on ranching and rodeoing and 
other things. But I admired Eddie Joe, and I knew

27:29.326 --> 27:42.701
that he would do very well, and I was not the least 
surprised when he was my corps commander, and I was

27:29.326 --> 27:42.701
very proud that he was our corps commander, and I 
thought he was a great one. Were there any notable

27:42.961 --> 27:47.806
visitors that came to A&M during that time? I can't 
think of any Hollywood stars or the president

27:47.826 --> 27:53.933
or... No. Oh, were you present in Duncan Dunning 
Hall when Linda Bird Johnson came to eat lunch? No,

28:04.751 --> 28:09.058
if I did, it didn't register, so I wasn't.

28:10.700 --> 28:14.065
While Lyndon was vice president, I think it was, 
Yeah, this would be a year before you. While Lyndon

28:16.923 --> 28:20.374
was vice president, he came to speak at SCONA. Oh, 
okay. And she came as a freshman from UT to come and

28:21.918 --> 28:26.653
hear her father speak. The Corps commander took 
her over to Duncan Dining Hall, and this is the week

28:27.697 --> 28:37.488
after the massacre of the Aggies on Thanksgiving 
Day. And on a given signal, all the fish jumped up

28:38.028 --> 28:42.493
and yelled, beat the hell out of TU. She stood up in 
silence, and everybody got very, very quiet. And

28:47.939 --> 28:53.485
then all at once, she gave a hook'em horn sign and 
yelled, hook'em horns, and they stood and cheered

28:47.939 --> 28:53.485
for her. No, I don't remember anything like that. 
What about MSC? Was that important for you? Were

29:00.823 --> 29:03.467
there MSC activities you participated in? Well, 
there was a couple things about the MSC. Number

29:06.692 --> 29:21.073
one,

29:06.692 --> 29:21.073
the Aggies that died in World War II, we ended up 
doing a Vietnam War kind of like that, where their

29:06.692 --> 29:21.073
names are all there. And I remember... frequently 
standing there just looking at those names and

29:23.924 --> 29:36.364
thinking about that, because Vietnam was 
happening, especially my senior year, because I

29:23.924 --> 29:36.364
knew I was going to Vietnam and everything. So that 
was kind of interesting. The second thing was I

29:38.868 --> 29:42.554
loved the Metzger gun collection. It was at the 
time in the MSC. And I just was fascinated that

29:45.479 --> 29:50.607
someone was could acquire a personal collection 
of firearms like that. And I would go up there, and

29:56.769 --> 30:00.153
there was hardly ever anybody there. And so it was 
kind of a solitude place for me. The other thing

30:04.259 --> 30:10.869
about the MSC was I could get, that's where I 
started learning to read the Wall Street. And I've

30:10.929 --> 30:12.411
read the Wall Street ever since. And I'd buy a Wall 
Street, a cup of coffee, and a donut for a quarter.

30:16.574 --> 30:24.240
And there was a special, and this was when I was a 
junior and a senior, and I would read the Wall

30:16.574 --> 30:24.240
Street in the same place at the same time. It seemed 
like the same place at the same time for two years.

30:29.163 --> 30:36.974
And the MSC, you know, I liked it, you know, 
because, you know, even seniors couldn't walk on

30:29.163 --> 30:36.974
the grass. I mean, it was a very special place. I 
never saw any harassment going on there. I just, it

30:44.065 --> 30:57.364
was, people seemed, and I started kind of 
understanding what, you know, when things were

30:44.065 --> 30:57.364
called memorial bridges or memorial stadiums or 
memorial thisses, you know, that most of that

30:58.492 --> 31:02.900
usually was tied to World War II or maybe World War 
I. And I, the MSC has, you know, just had a fond place

31:03.000 --> 31:13.319
in my heart, I think. In general, describe the A&M 
student body when you were here.
